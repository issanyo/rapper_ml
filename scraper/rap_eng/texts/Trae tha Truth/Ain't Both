[Intro]
Ay real talk nigga dig this
I'm serious man

[Hook: T.I.]
Holdin your own is just something, either you do or you can't
Is you a gangster for real, either you is or you ain't
It ain't both, it can't be both
You either solid and thoroughbred, or you snitch on your friends
Either you balling for real, or you leasing your Benz
It ain't both, it can't be both

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'm either ball deep in it or I'll accept the fact I'm finished
Demanding my respect when all these other rappers timid
Try me I'll bust a nigga ass in a minute
I'm just dyin' to ain't bust a nigga ass in a minute
I handle my business no mask when i did it
Just Latex gloves and trash bags when I'm finished
Shit you talk in your rhymes I really know how to do it
You braggin about a nine you know you ain't gon shoot it
You know you don't wanna kill a man
But then again scary nigga kill quicka, George Zimmerman
And Lord knows I be trying to be the bigger man
But one of you niggas try me I'm headed to the pen again
Stand up count, razor in my mouth
Shank a nigga ass on the yard and I'm out
We been know for keeping bails of kush and bricks of hard at the house
And we made it out of that  what we arguing about nigga?

[Hook: T.I.]
Holdin your own is just something, either you do or you can't
Is you a gangster for real, either you is or you ain't
It ain't both, it can't be both
You either solid and thoroughbred, or you snitch on your friends
Either you balling for real, or you leasing your Benz
It ain't both, it can't be both


[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Labor Day, Murci√©lago, everything elegant
Somewhere getting paper while pussy niggas irrelevant
Double barrel shotty's with nostrils big as an elephant
Leave spiritual and physical floating like you was Heaven sent
Black hand jack your face hiding under this beanie
Run up in you spot, wish a nigga would, fuck a genie
Haters catch execution like Benito Mussolini
Fuck the world like a Makaveli son of Misifini
Niggas say they banging, when it's pressure they a businessman
You out of bounds, fuck around and get charged like a sentence man
You either gangster out you ain't, fuck thinking about it
You and every pussy on you ship gonna end up sinkin out it
I die for my reputation get rejected
Knowing its a plague of fuck niggas leavin shit infected
I'm holding court off in these streets, get your issue swept
Jump out on them with this P-90 leave them to plead the fifth

[Hook 2: T.I.]
You either solid and thoroughbred, or you snitch on your friends
Either you balling for real, or you leasing your Benz
It ain't both, it can't be both

[Verse 3: Dro]
Ak-47 to your face, boy im dead wrong
Bullet to your dome for niggas thinking they head strong
Catch him with them Beats by Dre headsets on
If he ain't listen throw one up  in his headphone
Haah
Which one is you workin?
Say you pushing a Benz but you can't buy your bitch a Birkin
You a pussy that's for certain
And everybody feeling me
I got these niggas nervous, gorilla nigga really thin
Testarosa shit you mad cause im kosher huh
Blue diamonds in the charm, look like the ocean huh
50 keys nightly, wrists brightly
If you don't like the way that I'm kickin it come and fight me
Keep hollin' about you the man, but your hand out
While we was over seas buying keys til they ran out
See me in the 'vette tearing up the asphalt
Playing with a Hustle Gang nigga knock his ass off

[Hook 3: T.I.]
Holdin your own is just something, either you do or you can't
Is you a gangster for real, either you is or you ain't
It ain't both, it can't be both

[Verse 4: Spodee]
Business is business, packages shipping
No limit on spending, I'm in Fifth and Saks with the women
A chemist in kitchens I was cooking crack when a nigga was really 'posed to be timid
I really deserve a sentence
Bagging bitches is a talent, smart as devoted leaders
On probation for ten years and still hold heatas
Let a stupid nigga try Spodee, I'mma punch him in his face
If I can't beat him I'mma draw down with a forty
And these days bitches wanna bow down and adore me
I feed haters shit while eating shrimp, they mouth water
I keep potato chips with cheese dip in that order
A nigga hate on me I take his bitch past Florida
And you know that she ain't been nowhere
I really don't care, all a nigga really want is some head, I'mma watch your hair
I'mma be so fair, I got the whole city ridin with me
??

[Verse 5: Doe B]
Sucker niggas playing both sides, I'm straight as a bow tie
Point blank dead center, down the middle, bulls eye
Get familiar with a real nigga no cosign
Stand up guy like the roll tide o-line
Protecting my land if you ain't dying with honors then
You less of a man, nigga you a Juwanna-man
I came, I saw, I conquered
And my only fear is to slip and die on my momma land
It's a jungle man
You got rats, you got snakes out here
You got lions, you got apes out here
These niggas lying they so fake out here
Like them dead presidents ??

[Hook: T.I.]
Holdin your own is just something, either you do or you can't
Is you a gangster for real, either you is or you ain't
It ain't both, it can't be both
You either solid and thoroughbred, or you snitch on your friends
Either you balling for real, or you leasing your Benz
It ain't both, it can't be both
