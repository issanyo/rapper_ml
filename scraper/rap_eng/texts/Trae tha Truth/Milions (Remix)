[Intro: Pusha T]
You know what happen when G.O.O.D. Music and MMG get together, right?
We get that money

[Hook: Pusha T] x2
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
King of the streets, I’m killin on it
Brand new coupe, no ceiling on it
Wrist way cold, no feeling on it
So much ice I’m chilling on it
New crib, new yacht, put a million on it
Money stacked up, looking like a building, don’t it?
32 4 brick, no dealing on it
Land of the odd, no drilling on it
Got a Cuban bitch stud like a playboy wife
The same time with dick, I might play the night
She like to blow, under the play the mics
She know the game is over, she don’t play it right
Never seen the sun but some say I shine
These jackers talkin, I don’t it mind
New P90 stay fully loaded
Come fuck with me and I’mma vervine
Nigga I’m too real for these hoes
White alligator – these doors
Trunk go up, it don’t close
Woman on my grip with these foes
Got morbid flows for my toes
Had to be the reason why I end up toast
Probly no shit, don’t list a real
I’m certified hip, can’t fuck with those

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
This that shit that y’all wanted
This shit cook up hard, don’t it?
Y’all gotta beg my pardon on it
But this shit sound like God don’t it?
Yuugh, I’m tired, nigga and y’all gotta pay your tithes, nigga
Call my Phantom the holy ghost, church on chrome wheel tires, nigga
Pop tags when I’m paranoid, cause the pawn shop was my paradise
I was dead pop when that powder came for that knot saved in that shoebox
Blue tops, blue tops, bad bitch in that blue fox
This big face is in blu-ray and these black diamonds like boondocks
I restore the feelin’ of when niggas made a killin’
Hidin’ choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
And them hoes with angel faces, cryin’ loud with ill intentions
Just so I can buy them Christians, have ‘em shittin’ on all they bitches, ah!

[Hook: Pusha T] x2
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I’m haunted by horror stories, wanna-be home owners
Horrible outcome, a dope boy got one motive
Cries when he convicted, cried on every visit
I’m cryin’ sayin’ his name, ride for all my niggas
Used to fiddle my finger ’til I found me a fortune
Finger fuck a Ferrari, south of France early morning
Did drugs with Donatella, Versace my a cappella
Never see me in Neiman’s, niggas committin’ treason
Soft loafer preferred, frost, organic herb
Stay away from the Forbes, if I only could tell you more
I got this I got that, I got that I got this
Got a kilo for 20, my choppas say I’m the shit

[Hook: Pusha T] x2
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
This that shit y’all ask for
Make a nigga mash on the gas, floor
Two-door, four-door, roll through the hood like task force
Fast forward–oops! They say they wanna see proof
My record sales ain’t much as theirs and we still ride the same coupes
How we still fuck the same hoes, why we still buy the same clothes
How we both got the same watch, I’m just keepin’ y’all on y’all toes
Dope boys, gold mine, that price drop and that coke rise
Then set it over that blue flame then hang it dry like clothesline
I restore the feelin’ of when niggas made a killin’
Hidin’ choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
Got the razor on the counter, Arm & Hammer in the kitchen
Just to keep my feet in Christians and keep fuckin’ all y’all bitches

[Hook: Pusha T] x2
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet

[Outro] x4
This that shit that ya’ll wanted
This shit sound like God don’t it?
