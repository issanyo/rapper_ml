[Intro]
Motherfuck yo, mother fuck yo
Motherfuck, motherfuck, motherfuck yo
That's the hook right there
What you say Watson
Come on

[Hook: Trae tha Truth]
Nowadays I feel it's strange
Streets are different, this shit changed
Fuck these niggas I'ma get change
In the hutu strip like ain't shit changed
I swear to God this shit changed
Won't play the same, I gotta switch lanes
Real nigga, can't fuck with no lames
I play for real, I don't play games
Real nigga, can't fuck with no lames
I play for real, I don't play games
I swear to God this shit changed
Streets are different, this shit changed

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
I'm in an all-black wardrobe, finna hit the corner
Life is a bitch, you can tell her I don't want her
Bitch named nina, dead nigga run up on her
Fuck niggas nothing like me, I'm a loner
Everything real, I fuck em around the corner
Yeah I'm from the gutter where it's hotter than a sauna
Something like Floyd Mayweather when I go off
Your faith that I have [?] run up on ya
Never been a fake, tell em I'm real with it
Truk nino, [?] with it
Never gave a fuck then, you can tell em I'm still with it
Eff a hard nigga, you can tell em he's still with it
Tell em I was one of the realest that ever did this
Call me David Blane, would work the way I hit this
622-50 [?] street built this
Everything I touch I murder nigga, I kill this

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
Bitch I'm still here, nose dive to the coffin nigga
Feeling like the hood wanna off a nigga
Can't please everybody, too cold for niggas
I'm the same motherfucker who done fought for niggas
Bled for niggas, fed them niggas
Might have left a motherfucker dead for niggas
But I be God damn I'ma say it for niggas
They gon' tuck their tail if I [?] for niggas
[?] back in his good
Gladiator showed up like a pack in the hood
And you can call it what you want I got rack in the hood
Fuck a burner you die from a shank in the hood
So I wish this West stay hard hear us
Still press on, I'm, pressing yards fear us
Ducked out from you fake niggas
Ho just come bless what the yard give us

[Hook]
