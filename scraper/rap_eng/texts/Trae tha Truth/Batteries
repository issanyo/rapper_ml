Vizzy where your newer shit?
I'm underground slime, Ninja Turtle sewer shit
That joint I dropped in April make them hoes kneel like O'Neal
You retired from that green, I'm getting more deals, so ill
The shit I spit out of these two lips
Got me killing the game bring tulips
And I'm throwing out papers like newsies
So these girls wanna hang like nooses
And why waste aim on losers
When I'm gunnin' for the top, Tom Cruisin'
I John Hughes it, I John Holmes it, I go Hulk, and I go Hogan
Now tell me how I don't kill shit
When I stay bussing like field trips
The only time a nigga ever seen me
Is when he was watching a flim clip
And my old girl say I don't feel shit
Cause I won't stumble over her guilt trips
Miss her period, saying "I feel sick!"
She cut that act out real quick
And I'm on my Uncle Phil shit
Throw out some jazz and get some cake
You think those little Nicki's gonna
Make you fill up banks?
I don't trust no one but God
Say my prayers and give him thanks
Porto-potties on the moon
Man, I shit in outer space

[Hook]
Say I ain't gridin', say I ain't focused
I say "ok! I'm reloaded"
I see the top, that's where I'm going
I'm like "ok! I'm reloaded"

Bitch, I'm reloaded

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Shots about to come, all I know is reload
X-Men shit - you can tell 'em I'm in beast mode
Everything blue, from the dash to the seats ho
Off in traffic, sliding like I'm on grease road
I'm on a full speed mission, ain't no brakes
I'm trying to stay strong like I was on weights
They say this my last shot, no more takes
I got (?) at slow rates
My ex-bitch tripped out, that's what she gets
Said I wouldn't be shit, I need a hit
Now every time she turn on the TV
I tell her watch close, see the money that a nigga get
I got the streets on fire
I'm looking at the top, I'm 'bout to take aim
Even if I miss, I'll be back at it again
And if I lose, I'll be back at it to win
I been a fighter, never been a quitter
The world mine, told her I was on my way to get her
Leave they face looking like they ate something bitter
(?), ain't nobody finna enter
Say XV, it's OK
I loaded up, this A-K
Somebody finna get it, I bet it ain't me
So it must be them - don't play

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: XV]
OK, I'm reloaded
Batteries in my controller
Make casualties out of my opponents
And make money for the niggas I roll with
'Til all my brothers is rich like the Jacksons, like the Jonas
Maybachs I can’t afford, so 'til then I’m focused
Making my presence with this rapping so I purchase what I wish
Cause even with my curses, all these verses are a gift
Said I'll be shooting for the stars, so it ain't worthless if I miss
But if you playing to hit the clouds, so just come down with a bunch of regrets
Through all the doubters, the way I still put these words together
Got me more connections than routers and surge protectors
I'm what happens when awesome and awkward merge together
I been killed the game, these lames expunged my murder record
You get comfy with that crown that you got
And you'll get lapped to the top like a Mac out the box
They say "We just wants some music. Is that asking a lot?"
I say "OK. I'm reloaded," pull that mac out and pop

[Hook] x2
