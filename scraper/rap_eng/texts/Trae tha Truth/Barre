[Refrain]
Drinkin’ by the bar y’all
Bar y’all, oh my God
Drinkin’ by the bar y’all
Bar y’all, oh my God

[Verse]
Houston is pissed off
Still in the same lane
Diamonds be wildin’ out
I told ‘em to stay and hang
Look like I’m doing time
My neck in the chain gang
Everything fly as hell
Still on that same plane
Thinking about Booyor
That’s that Big Boo Yoo baby
Still represent the Click
Just movin’ solo baby
Thinking ‘bout where we been
Keep me from going crazy
Had the whole world leanin’
Motion to something lazy
No doubt about it
Thinking about you and Screw
And how we used to talk and blaze
Yellin’ “man, hol’ up”
Bald faded, versace shades
Tap, tappin’ on boys
Bring it back
That was word to H-A-W-K, 3-2, and Pat, nigga

[Refrain]

[Hook]
Tippin’ on these fools
Movin’ slow
Trunk never closed
Niggas know
I’m gon’ brimp the click
It’s all I know
Somewhere off in traffic, moving slow
And all I wore is riff, what’s goin’ on?
I’ve gotta hold it down
I can’t let go

[Bridge x2]
I tell the boys in blue
Imma stay screwed up
It’s gonna heal me from my wound up, wound up

[Refrain]

[Hook]
