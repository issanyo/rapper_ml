(Dallas)
Yeah uh, this is Dallas
Yaaaa-aaaay uh, du-du-du-du
Du-du-du-du-du-du, we got Trae and
We've been hustling, for a long

[Hook: Dallas]
I've been hustling, in this life of mine
Some of y'all, got a clue
See I've been grinding, in these streets
And I, finally got my break through
Mama told me, it's gon be iight
Lord if I, trust you
So I'm gon keep my eyes, on the final prize
See I got, my break through

[Trae]
I'm on a mission trying to get it, full time and I don't plan on losing damn
Why they don't wanna let me live, my life the way that I'm choosing to
Everyday it's a struggle mayn, went from sunlight to heavy rain
Everybody got some'ing to say, about me and mine but they don't feel my pain
Constantly, everybody wanna say what they've done for me
But I don't recall, y'all doing shit for me
I work hard one deep, all day all night and never no sleep
Only help that I got is God, all my family turning fraud
Only thing I got left for me is my son, since my life done got scarred
Mama told me niggas phony, get your change and be by your lonely
I never knew why until this day, still don't but the Lord'll show me
Inside this life of mine, I always knew it would be my time
So I've been hustling everyday, be on the grind for mine

[Hook]

[Dallas]
Some hit the spot, some the block
Some of y'all, don't know what to do
Some get your Glock, off your rocks
Just trying to make it through
But me I hustle on my music, I know how to use it
Do it to the best (beeest)
And me I'm all about my paper, me I gotta make it
Gotta make it last
I got to get my do', I got to get some mo'
Go to stay on my grind, I got to get mine

[Hook]

[Trae]
Ain't no telling when I'ma get my rest, with the stress that I'm facing daily
My people really trying to play me, but I'm real and they can not fade me
Time after time, and I'm breathing never leaving my time to blow is now
And who gon stop me on my move, and never let the block be out
Lose it it'll be my day, one day cause I've been patiently waiting
For everything I deserve, that's why they be hating
Like they don't wanna see me shine, they'd rather see my head pointed down
But I'm still gon do my thang, I got the chance and I'ma hold it down
I'm back for the first time, and I'm steady standing
And I went from bad to doing worse, but still I feel abandoned
That's why I'm next to gain the throne, and I'm bringing it home
Cause I've been hustling all my life, and I did it alone

[Hook]

(Dallas)
I'm hustling, all of my life I've been hu-
All of my life, all of my li-i-i-i-i-i-i-fe yeah yeah yeah
Ah no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no
