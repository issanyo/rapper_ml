Chorus (Exerpt from Swang (Big Hawk))
I would give my last breath if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back
Matter fact
Bring the whole crew back
Give my-give my last breath if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back
Matter fact
Bring the whole crew back
I would give my last breath if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back
Matter fact
Bring the whole crew back
Give my-give my last breath
Give my-give my last breath
Give my-give my last breath
If I could bring you back
Verse 1 (Trae)
H-A-W-K I feel like I'm lonely homie I need to talk
So ask Jesus can I see you a second so we can take a walk
It's like a lot done changed since we kicked it the night before
I feel I lost it all and still got a part of my life to go
And just to let you know I'm livin' it up to make you proud
That's why I represent and I scream it everytime I touch a drought
I'm Screwed Up Click forever no doubt I'ma rep it like ya
Holdin' it for Screw makin' sure the rest of us step it like ya
Sometimes I feel I shoulda never got that call
And when I made it to the scene it's like my spirit took a fall
I was the last to leave the place where they found you I couldn't breathe at all
Sometimes I wake up feelin' like why the f*** should I breathe at all
Chorus
Verse 2 (Trae)
Nobody can tell you 'bout pain the way I can tell you 'bout pain
Until your partner's family suffers enough to blow out your brains
Everyday it be the same thing prayin' that I can hold on
And I swear to life you gon' live through this partner everytime I roll on
One hundred is what you was keepin' it real like a few does
That's why you in the same category that me and Screw was
I remember you stayin' down with me in my time of need
And yo my son I got charged that can rob for whatever they need
And if I lose my life say Hawk I'm a rider other n****z didn't try
You was there you never left to be stronger that's why I didn't cry
Pray you got to heaven and I feel it when I look up in the sky
I told you you my brother forever homie I didn't lie
Chorus
Verse 3 (Trae)
I used to never understand when you hurtin' why life go on
I guess cuz they ain't never tell me that life in itself is wrong
I would give my last breath if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back
Matter fact
Bring the whole crew back
And if we never see each other I love you and that's a fact
And tell Pac I'm holdin' it down and chunk the duece from me to Pat
I ain't gon' never switch you up Hawk I'm ridin' this one out
And tell the devil I'm the truth that's why he hidin' this one out
I feel my body had to fight to walk your casket to the grave
No matter how it went I never thought that I'd put you in the grave
I would do this here for you and your momma, your wife and your kids
Frasier to John homie I got you that's what it is
Chorus

(Trae over chorus)
H-A-W-K
Yo this really get hard for me right here homie
You know whay I'm sayin' I know it
Been in these streets from yay high bro
I told you I was gon' make you proud man
I'm in these streets for real runnin' circles around these chumps
It's Screwed Up Click for life man
H-A-W-K
