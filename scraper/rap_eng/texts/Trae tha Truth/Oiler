[Intro: Zuse]
It's midnight, I'm heading down to your crib
I'm on one, got chad all in my drink
R.I.P to the pimp, underground these motherfuckers
They know I'm bout to be king
Missed call from my main girl but my mindset is on Kim
My ex-girl who branched out and amputated her limb
It's all good, she gon' see the man, the young boy turned in
Still swangin' on these folks, with the same guys I came with
Now what the fuck should I think?

[Hook]
I'm screwed up, you can blame that on the beer
Screwed up, UGK up in my drink
Screwed up, Actavis under my skin
Screwed up, I can never trust a bitch

[Bridge]
Where ya been at? How ya been?
How ya doing, girl? Can I come in?
Where ya been at? How ya been?
How ya doing, girl? Can I come in?
Yeah

[Verse 1: Zuse]
Called her up, I'm down to ride and we all up
Sippin' on that cough syrup, that Big Mo
Pour four for the Pimp too, this Big Hawk, not pimp juice
Hold up, let it sink in, got pink all in my system
Swangin' down that highway, my girl say I move sideways, it's alright
Cup muddy on hard ice, don't give a fuck like I'm [?]
Ain't nothing change but the weather baby
But the young boy got the star life
Same boy who came up was the same man working all night

[Hook]
I'm screwed up, you can blame that on the beer
Screwed up, UGK up in my drink
Screwed up, Actavis under my skin
Screwed up, I can never trust a bitch

[Bridge]
Where ya been at? How ya been?
How ya doing, girl? Can I come in?
Where ya been at? How ya been?
How ya doing, girl? Can I come in?
Yeah

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Young street king, ain't nothing switched
I'm paid in full and I ain't talking Mitch
I got a couple tools to get a hater fixed
Finna' screw em up like it was 96'
With a bitch tryna' catch another bitch
On six-fours with this (triback?)
You can't top that even if you could, I'll still steal the scene like I was coming on a jet
You nigas still ain't shit, get the fuck off my dick
You pillow talking to something you probably still ain't hit
Who me? Naw I'm just cooling homie
(?) up slow same color of bricks
I'm Houston, Texas, born and raised nigga
I'm screwed for life, this ain't a phase nigga
Rest in peace, I miss them days nigga
Clipse, Screw, and Dub K nigga

[Hook]
I'm screwed up, you can blame that on the beer
Screwed up, UGK up in my drink
Screwed up, Actavis under my skin
Screwed up, I can never trust a bitch

[Bridge]
Where ya been at? How ya been?
How ya doing, girl? Can I come in?
Where ya been at? How ya been?
How ya doing, girl? Can I come in?
Yeah
