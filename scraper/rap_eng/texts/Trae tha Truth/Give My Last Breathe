[Chorus - H.A.W.K.]
I would give my last breathe if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back - matter of fact bring the whole crew back
Give my - give my last breathe if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back - matter of fact bring the whole crew back
I would give my last breathe if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back - matter of fact bring the whole crew back
Give my - give my last breathe - Give my, give my last breathe
Give my - give my last breathe if I could bring you back

[Verse 1 - Trae]
H.A.W.K. I feel like I'm lonely homey, I need to talk
So ask Jesus if I can see for a second - so we can take a walk
It's like alot done changed since we kicked it the night befo
I feel I lost it all but still got a part of my life to go(damn)
And just to let you know I'm livin it up to make you proud
That's why I represent and I scream it everytime I touch a crowd(yeah)
I'm Screwed Up Click forever, no doubt I'm a rep it like ya
Holdin it for Screw - maybe show the rest I'm gon step it like ya
Sometimes I feel I should've never got that call
And when I made it to the scene it's like my spirit took a fall
I was the last to leave the place where they found you, I couldn't breath at all
Sometimes I wake up feelin like why the fuck should I breath at all

(Chorus - H.A.W.K.)

[Verse 2 - Trae]
Nobody can tell you bout pain - the way I can tell you bout pain
Watchin ya partna family suffer's enough to blow out ya brains
Everyday it be the same thing prayin that I can hold on
And I swear to life, you gon live thru this partna everytime I roll on
One hundred is what you was, keepin it real - like a few dubs
That's why you in the same category that me and Screw was
I remember you stayin down with me in my time of need
And on my son I got Josh and Corade for whatever they need
And if I lose my life I'm a rider, say Hawk another niggas try
But still I had to be stronger that's why I didn't cry
I pray you got to Heaven, and I feel it when I look up in the sky
I told you, you my brother forever - homey I didn't lie

[Chorus - H.A.W.K.]

[Verse 3 - Trae]
I use to never understand when you hurtin why life go on
I guess cause they ain't never tell me that life it self is wrong
I would give my last breathe if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back, matter of fact bring the whole crew back
And if we never see each other I love you and that's a fact
And tell Pac I'm holdin it down, and chunk the duece for me to Pat
I ain't gon never switch it up Hawk I'm ridin this one out
And to the devil I'm the truth that's why he hidin this one out
I feel my body had to fight to mark yo casket to the grave
No matter how it went I never thought that I'd put you in the grave
I do this here for you and yo'momma, yo wife, and yo kids
Frasier to John homey, I got you that's what it is

[Chorus Till End]
