(*singing*)

(*talking*)
Yeah, you niggas know what time it is around here mayn
Yeah we still on that hood shit, just had to take this shit
To another motherfucking level, know I'm saying
Trae, Mya huh we bout to set it off round this motherfucker

[Trae]
Bout time they make way for another guerilla, these other niggas ain't the truth
Come down to the bottom of the map and holler at Trae, and these niggas gon give you the proof
I roll with a entourage of them Assholes, on 24 inches of chrome
And plus the baddest lady Mya, to help a G get in his zone
Lately I've been getting slipped up, till they see that black on black with something packed
The back of the frame, to show these niggas how to act
I'm from the South, where we known to look good in our mouth with diamonds shining bright
It's Screwed Up Click to the death, with niggas crawling slow with purple Sprites
We thugging baby, the corners we hugging daily we grind
Through the day and night, ain't no sleeping for nothing baby Slow Loud when I bang
And don't confuse me, cause the game ain't what it need to be
'Less you like bullshit music, from them bullshit niggas on T.V
I call it how I see it, ain't no other way that I feel is real
Don't think they real as Pac, just cause them niggas done sold a couple of mill
And a deal don't make you, just because your label ride your dick
We been here paying dues, it's just a matter of time before we click

[Hook: Mya]
Baby don't you worry bout a thang, see everything's gonna be ok
Cause I'ma be right by your side, while you on the grind
Just keep it hood, keep it gangsta
Get that change, make that paper
Keep it moving, stack them dollas baby
It's only a matter of time
It's only a matter of time
So I'ma do what I gotta do, to get mine

[Trae]
I knew it, but I bet they thought that they could keep me here to wait
But now it's time, that I introduce the world to Trae
One of the hoodest out the H, a ghetto legend and the next to be
Plus my swagger, got me at the status of an original G
24's on my truck, haters better duck and get the fuck out of my range
It ain't gon be a pretty sight, if they wanna try to come stop my change
Cause I'ma ride or die with Mya, two of the same so we a team
And anybody disrespect it, watch how much drama I bring
And watch how much diamonds I bling, when the grill get in they face
And if my gangsta on the line, just watch how fast I'ma win the race
And I don't think they want it baby, we 1 and O for the belt
Now everytime we spit together, just know that we gon be felt

[Hook]

(*singing*)

[Mya]
I know you feeling really anxious, when I'm on your side
But can't no other replicate ya, so you ain't gotta think twice
See I'ma hold it down for you, do what I gotta do you know how we do
So don't you worry bout a thaaaang, it's only a matter of time
It's only a matter of time, so I'ma do what I gotta do to get mine

[Hook]
