[Intro - 2x]
Fall off in the club, let's get it popping
I'mma drank Patrone, till the do's go to locking
Fat booty dropping, I'mma do my thang
Long necks stay bopping boss, I'mma spit my game

[Six Tre]
I'mma come up in this thang, miscean and a fitted
Them new J's the piece and chain, looking mean on you bitches
I got a sleigh round my waistline, mossie oak down
Diamond style, boppers get the green and niggas get the frown
No smile get it twisted, and you will get stomped
Mayn your partnas ain't gon help you, cause your click full of chumps
Don't get your shit locked up, and disfigured
In the club drunk jumping, with them young crunk niggas
If you bump me, I'mma go G with it
Brought a mac up in the club, but I'm low key with it
All the bouncers show me love, cause they know G give it
They don't shake a nigga down, cause I'm O.G. with it
Ay dope boy in it, give me some room
I done came down, with the legion of doom
I'mma bust rounds, with the legion of doom
If you tremble with us kinfolk, you be in your tomb

[Hook - 2x]
We got the J's on, we in the club jumping
The boppers looking good, they trying to cut something
Sipping on Patrone, swisha full of purp'
Don't ask us how we do it, you know we got that work

[Trae]
I got them J's on my toes, heater on the hip
Not to mention I'm fifty deep, in case a hater wanna trip
Niggas bout to get the bidness, acting hard like a G
Who the fuck he talking to, it damn sho' ain't me
I'll bring it to your do', like Fed-Ex or the UPS
Introducing you to the ground, till the bouncers pumping your chest
I'm nothing like you done seen, hundred grand worth of ice lit
It ain't no need for thinking bout it, I garuntee I'm the shit
Loc's all across the face, of a gangsta inside the club
Just know that I'm watching niggas, they jumping they getting drug
I got clip in the homie dog, and on top of that A.B.N
And we don't give a fuck, niggas know ain't no stopping A.B.N
Boss on that Patrone, Jay'Ton got it cracking
Two thousand worth of ones, will have these roaching hoes stacking
Trae moving screwed up, and got boys in a daze
If I make it to the trunk, boys bout to hear them K's

[Hook - 2x]

[Six Tre]
Cause I'm crucial with it, Cotton Row up in this piece with me
Coedine got them hoes, getting blowed off the Remmy
Blue Dog, got em getting throwed off the Henny
They gon have em ass naked, we won't spend nan penny
I know, you lame ass niggas gon trip
When we dip up out the backdo', with your main chick
Might as well, go on take the handcuffs off her wrist
She going with me I got reservations at the Rits
She going to free, she gon get up in the G whip
And soon as we hit the room, she gon do the whole click
But I gotta commend you homes, mayn your broad too thick
My mella I like your taste, I'mma take your next chick simp

[Hook - 2x]
