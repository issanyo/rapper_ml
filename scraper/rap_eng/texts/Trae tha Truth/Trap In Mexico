[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Woke up outside of town a little bit lost
Little bit of Jack and the Yak caught in my mouth
Never knew my shadow would leave me out
I guess it was no will, no way, and no how
Burn that tree and burn it fast
Hopped in the DB9 and scurried off fast
The devil's a lie, we all know that
I guess it’s no way in or way out

[Hook: Travis Scott]
I’m getting to the money
Just got back from Mexico
Swear to god we eatin' bruh
Copped that lean from the Texaco
I’m getting to the money
Trapping out in Mexico
Fucked my first stripper bruh
She sip that lean from the Texaco

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Yeah, posted up in this pickup
New plug, hope I don’t get fucked
I know if I feel something ain’t going right
Everyone around here finna get stuck up
I’m ‘bouta bounce and I know it so I can’t trip
Full clip, one in the chamber, can’t slip
Kidnap, I ain’t with that
I made it to this bitch, I want neck
Juan got the plug at the Texaco
I’m in the back getting drink from my Mexican ho
Lord knows if I get these drugs back to Texas
I’ma put the drank man under pressure ho
In the game with the work, I was set to score
Any brick I get I’ma strech for more
Took off in the valley, off next to blow
On the phone with the connect tryna check for dope
Any means I’ma get this dough
It don’t matter what it is, it gotta go
Fast living, don’t nothing come slow
Come show, we’ll be in front of your door
