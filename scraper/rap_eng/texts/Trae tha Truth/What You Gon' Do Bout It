[Verse 1: T.I.]
Spot a pussy nigga I don't like
Walk up on his ass take flight
All my nigga gon' fight
Natural when we see you on sight
Check it
Pussy nigga die every time I bless 'em
Till the other side recognize my message-
Disrespect the city' king ???
Black his eye get his ass outta my presence-
Fully automatic choppa they shootin' 'em-
Hustle Gang you know you don't wanna fool with them-
All the sharks in the water they cool with them
Yo pussy ass i' never in the mood to swim
Bring it to a nigga face in 3D
Move more gas than the BP
Nigga betta pay homage when you see me
Or Imma send a chief to your teepee-
Keep me 3 or 4 bitches in the back-
They rollin' backwood by the pack-
Bet the back they blowin'
2015 Cadillac she stole it-
And we ain't goin' home till we see her break dome nigga

[Hook: Zuse]



[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Young ? got a chopper in the Lambo

Lookie here pussy nigga whatchu stand fo'
Man down try'na put you where the sand go
Now what the fuck you feelin'a do about it
Nigga we could fight or we could shoot about it

Imma asshole nigga nothin' new about it

I play with this lead I'm not talkin' no pencil-
I keep me 3 youngins strapped up in that rental-
To check anything that you say out yo dental-
Real street nigga I'm the king of the ground
Walk up in the club shut the whole club down-
Put the H in the air yeah I'm ridin' for the town-
Only finna see the truth going south-west bound-
Nigga where yo bitch at I'm try'na fuck so'um

Facedown tell that ho to headbutt so'um

Bet I go against the frame nigga
Chain stupid I'm insane nigga

[Hook: Zuse]

And I showed 'em who the hardest

And yo bitch think she bad she ain't really all that-
Coulda hit her with a baseball bat from the truck to fall back, nigga

[Bridge: Zuse]
Someone please call 9-1-1 tell 'em I just shot my gun

Heatah coughin' on di muthafucka like my gun just got di flu
Catch a nigga out di blue
Take a nigga out his shoes
Nevah missin' if I aim it at you Imma blow a nigga out my view
Tell a nigga what I do
Choppa break you down in two
Spot a nigga like a clue
Catch a nigga on the news

[Outro: Zuse]

Whatchu gon' do bout it (x3)

Someone please call 9-1-1 tell 'em I just shot my gun
