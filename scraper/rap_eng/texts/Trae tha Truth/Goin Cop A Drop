[Verse 1:]
Cheeah, nothing promise so I kick it like I'm bout to leave
Fighting pressure got me practicing my barb and weave
I deal with hate like love is something that I don't believe
Nothing less than thankful tryna cherish everyday I breathe
Street nigga, hood credit nigga nothing cash
Unless I'm in the hood stunting with my nothing ass
Paparazzi on em look at all these flashing lights
Outta control something like a pilot who was crash at flight
Seven letter certified by the sender
I bring the hood to any section I enter, and that they better remember
They tell me smile but in they no mind DJ
One of my brothers gone away till November
Until then I'm goin be...

Go and cop a drop, sittin-sittin on some custom rims
Go and cop a drop, sittin-sittin on some custom rims
Go and cop a drop, sittin-sittin on some custom rims
Go and cop a drop, sittin-sittin on some custom rims
I represent for the south (hey) my resident is a sloim
I represent for the south (hey) my resident is a sloim
I represent for the south (hey) my resident is a sloim

[Verse 2:]
Lil homies on the corner askin what the buisness?
I say the struggle knowing haters praying that I'm finished
They rather superman but radio say he's a menace
When others left the hood these stay to catch perfect attendants
Word on the street messing with Trae it could lose your career
Yeah that might be true the pussy niggas who living in fear
Fuck em, seeing it close something they wouldn't using
This day eviction note is tell them niggas keep it moving
The sound in my trunk is atomic, speakers plexing
And I'm slippin on this Challenger glass see on reflection
And I'm pose through anger management, swangers so much aggression
Even wise over stretching like crazy
No direction...

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I'm in this old school nobody but me in the car
I fin em slumps try'na duck off from being a star
Call it an asshole state of mind
So I do clarity at this watch under these rocks to display the time
Half of that inside the grill or say I'm doin fine
I know these haters hot as fuck to see me doin mine
They tell me focus on the day, I only see at night
In this black locs try'na stop the world from being bright
Cheeah, till the casket I'm the realist in it
I guess they never got the message so I'm here to send it
I'm on they ass until the world understand me
I try to tell em ain't no way they can ban me
Picture me rollin I'm...
