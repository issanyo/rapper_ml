[Trae {*talking}]
I ain't letting shit go*
I mean who the hell give these people the right to tell me who I should stand up for?
Goin tell me I represent for those people
Who the fuck is those people?
What'chu talkin' bout the slumps, the gutta
Look I ain't you
I ain't goin never turn my back

Last year was a hard one, but life goes on
Hold my head against the wall learning right from wrong
They say my-me for the outcome, ban my records
Check it, don't have to bump this but please respect it
I took a-me for the outcome, ban my records
Check it, don't have to bump this but please respect it
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
Turned into a plus, now they stuck living blinded

[Verse 1:]
My last year was the worst but my life goes on
I been balance most of my life I feel like something is wrong
I know this goin be okay soon as I weather this storm
And make a call up there of God I hope he answer his phone
They say my music for the less fortunate people in the bad place
What about all the victims and children with a sad case
I'm they big homie and I won't turn my back for none of y'all
Ever try to hurt or maybe hell on everyone of y'all
Maybe that's why they out here banning my records
Check it, ain't gotta like tha Truth but please respect it
I'm on that Pac shit, even if I fall I try to do my best
Tell em I was focus on the slumps I couldn't see the rest
Within the process I seen alot wishing me harm
Knowing the truth need the only thang keeping me calm
And even know I know that hateful shit ain't bad to me
I had to make myself a sacrifice so people can see

Last year was a hard one, but life goes on (life goes on)
Hold my head against the wall learning right from wrong (learning right from wrong)
They say my-me for the outcome, ban my records (they ban my records)
Check it, don't have to bump this but please respect it (homie please respect it)
I took a-me for the outcome, ban my records (they ban my records)
Check it, don't have to bump this but please respect it (homie please respect it)
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us (cheeah)
Turned into a plus, now they stuck living blinded

[Verse 2:]
All this time in the drain got me losing my cool
Instead of teaming with the fake I choose to move with this tool
I keep it for my protection knowing nothing is real
So either streets or with this rapping they got something to feel
All I did was gave my life to em for what it is nothing else
I shall they knew that wouldn't understand knowing they something else
They try to count me out, take away from me and mine
Yeah the road is low but I know one thang I'm goin be a shine
If God is my shield no weapon shall prosper the solider
I am the truth and you can bred it was there if I told ya
I'm standing strong I ain't goin be the one they pushing over
I'm frowning now but I'll be smiling for they say it's over
It's me against the world homie that's no lie
Sunny days never chill they only roll by
They want my thoughts so I'm a load up and give it to em
I stamp it box it up and then send it too em
