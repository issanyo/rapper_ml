[Verse 1: Trae the Truth]
Hey, I'm in the badass [?]
Yeah, I'm gettin' top from my badass [?]
Keen, got these trees â€“ they ain't that good
I am the [?], woah, who has power? Ayy, no red lawn
[Tits?] so dark, you would think it had a tan
Leonard Grant's [?] got me feelin' like the man
Yo bitch basic, if he could [?]
Eat the [copper?], both freaks, [last?] sounded like a plane
Oh, glass [sips?] swingin' like a alcoholic
A real ace [?] is what you bitch are coded
So we're on the south-west while I'm tryin' my [holdin'?]
Hold this money, got my packets worth a thousand dollars

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
Bought you a 6, bought you a iPhone 6
Peep this, peep the Rocky Glaciers in my wrist
Drop top rolling Jody high on the plane
New Ferrari tires ain't slipping in the rain
New Coop drop, ain't trippin' bout ya man
Ain't worried bout a girl unless she in my shower
Used to pull up candy tangerine and Eisenhower
Ash tray, I ain't ever been in the shade
Shinin' like the sun, dropped out in the tenth grade
Shinin' like the moon and ball like Warren Moon
Shotblock perfection, air shock with Brock Lesnar
[?] connections, RiFF
