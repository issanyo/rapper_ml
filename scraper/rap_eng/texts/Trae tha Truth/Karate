[Intro]
You know, This just some real nigga shit, a real nigga story
You know what I’m saying?

[Hook]
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in the new ‘rarri
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serve it to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billy Jean

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Pull up in a Panamera lookin so clean
Weaving in and out of traffic like it’s on lean
Call me murda nigga, tryna kill the whole scene
Getting money like I’m tryna feed the whole team
No lie, Im'a do it for the whole south
Somebody better tell them other niggas hold off
Keep fuckin with a nigga, Im'a go off
Jump fly, Im'a run up in that ho mouth
Gotta hella short temper, nigga money long
Leave holes in a nigga like a honey comb
Kill shit like I do a nigga, nigga’s on
Asshole, you can see I’m in another zone
Real nigga kick shit like karate
Chop niggas up like I’m tryna cook beef
Bitch wanna fuck, gotta put er on a leash
Before I run up in er, then I put er back up there out on the street
Any time I cop a whip I’m goin floss
Nigga this hit the turn on lil boss
When it come to Houston, Texas that’s me
Tell em I’m ten for ten with no loss

[Verse 2: Future]
Got a Panamera round a young nigga neck
Got a young bitch pulling up in a vet
Smoke a lot of kush & I have a lot of sex
Had to beat the grind up, ran up my check
Bitch nigga get money, nigga get that
Roll a blunt of chronic, nigga sell a lot of crack
You can hit a nigga line, order what you want
I can whoop a Maserati, pulling up a donk
50,000 on yo watch, young nigga splurge
Pop a ace of spade bottle, sip a lot of syrup
Keep a young nigga workin’ that’ll bust a k
I’mma take a phone call, hustle everyday

[Hook]
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in the new ‘rarri
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billy Jean

[Verse 3: Future]
Whipping up a cake, just to go and snatch a spider
Young nigga play with keys, like a type writer
Al Capone, John Gotti was a nigga idol
I was never snitching, I can put it on the Bible
In a 4 door beamer, driving with a rifle
Nigga where you at, nigga we gon pull up on ya
Young Bitch looking like Janet in the 80′s
We was grinding up from a tube and a baby
Got the girl dripping wet like a jerry curl
Got that styrofoam cup and its full of syrup
Send it over from Lil Mexico & Let me Work
I can get 36 for a clean shirt

[Hook]
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in the new ‘rarri
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
