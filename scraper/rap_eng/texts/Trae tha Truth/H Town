[Verse 1: Boogz Boogetz]

Them swishers on me, yea you know my blunts be double stuffed
No pills off over head cuz I ain’t on that other stuff
My sling is slingin’, bad bitch with me with a bubble but
I’m blowin’ circles, sippin’ purple, rock this double cup
Put that Big Moe and puff it louder, let it play again
My candy cane drip off old school that I’m layin’ in
My car got space, it’s like that house that you be stayin’ in
Shout out to Trae and all the homies reppin’ ABN, I’m G affiliated
You know I keep it hundred mane, good plan
Layin’ back, relaxin’ while my feet rest on that wood plank
Don’t I keep it gutter? Yea the people say I could change
Haters takin’ shots at me but they ain’t got no good aim
It’s like my birthday cause I get a lot of cake
Pockets kinda chubby, you could say they getting out of shape
They spill in my cups so lil' nigga you should try a taste
That lean got me sleep walkin’ but I’m feelin’ wide awake


[Hook: Boogz Boogetz]

That purple pull me up, there’s purple in my cup
I get ready for a long night
I got to roll this up, the squishy got me stuck
But then it got me feelin’ alright
See this is for the H Town, H Town, H Town
See this is for the H Town, H Town, H Town
We rollin’ with it


[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]

Somewhere solo in the ghetto, hustlin’ what should get paid
Reminiscin’ about homies I’d involve so I can’t get bit
Don’t get too close, I’m advisin’ your ass to sit back
Fuck around with the king and in return bullets can sit back
They split the gadgets with the fulls, they like a set of arms
With somethin’ they towed in the trunk, as if they ain’t recall
And I don’t blame ‘em, I’d rather let ‘em do what they do
Hit the block opposite of the speed that slow it down for scoob
I’m underneath something that’s wet like it will never dry
Plus I’m the pilot up in this plane although it never flied
And if it did I’d probably be on the way to get paid
Something that’s sexy in the back on the way to get laid
I do my thing, cover the tip, bitch I play in the shade
So jackers can’t see what I’m holdin’, they get lost or get sprayed
And for my nigga in the weed, HMAPAT
We gon' bring it back, thinkin’ to screw with pimp C


[Hook: Boogz Boogetz]

Yup, there’s purple in my cup
I get ready for a long night
I got to roll this up, the squishy got me stuck
But then it got me feelin’ alright
See this is for the H Town, H Town, H Town
See this is for the H Town, H Town, H Town
We rollin’ with it
