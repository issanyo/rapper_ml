[Hook x2: Wooh Da Kid]
I'm a bad bitch maniac, I can't get enough
She a nympho maniac, she can't get enough
I'm a money making animal, I can't get enough
She a meat eating cannibal, she can't get enough

[Verse 1: Wooh Da Kid]
Walking through the club, diamonds hella lit
Wooh Da fucking good, opposite of celibate
In the club popping bottles, getting hella bent
Bad bitch with me, ass like an elephant
Five in the morning, up smoking g'naj
Two foreign bitches in my bed, I just smin'ashed
Never kiss and tell but I tell you what she kiss
She kissing on my wee-wee, but we ain't speaking French
Squad

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae The Truth]
Aston Martin, bad clothes
Bad hoes that got bad hoes
Got flight bands, can't class those
My stacks solid, can't crash those
She deep dick, I tip glass
Small waist line, got thick ass
If she slip she get smashed
The same night she get passed
Keep diamonds all in my rin'ing
Bands hit the club and run in it
New Rolly' face and it's tinted
Presidential like ?
I swear they think I'm dumb but I'm young boss like Young Boss
I set it off, it make hoes drown
Please don't make these one's ?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bo Deal]
It's Bo Deal, haters better duck
Foreign bitch who like to suck and fuck, I can't get enough
All the dancers, they say I'm handsome, so I'm in love
We them Squad boys, hit the club, diamonds lit it up
Steal the show when we go out
I'm laid back up in your house
Dick up in your ho mouth
We fucking like it's a ho house
Yeah, and it ain't candles that she blow out
I ain't gotta throw dough out
She love to show up and show out

[Hook]
