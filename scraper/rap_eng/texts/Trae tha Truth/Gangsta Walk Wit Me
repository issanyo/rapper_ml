(*talking*)
Run the tape treal, I know when I'm in the zone
We gangstas right chea, oh yeah (oh yeah)
Say uh uh say uh, I'm so gangsta
So motherfucking gangsta, I'm so gangsta look at me wow

[Mike D]
I'm gangsta gangsta, Southside playa
Put my pimp down like P-A-T, a super hoe layer
It's return of the rapper, slash the hood fella
Looking for a rat, to get her groove back like Stella
Still got a sack of that A-1, good yella
With a baby Glock, ready to rock-a-bye fellas
Hit me on the cella, ain't a damn thang changed
I take a brick, make that hoe in the two thangs
How I get down my cats, sit him down
Pull up in your city, and shut that hoe down
I'm like Baby, I got that work for 2-0
Hugging the block daddy, kidnap do'
Drop top Cadillacs, I ride with mink rugs
Compatible to none, cause I'm a distinct thug
You new cats don't move me, the O.G. back
I got love in A-T-X, all the way to the flats
A lil' some'ing in Alabama, some in Arkansas
Memphis Tenn. down with me, my folks in Lake Charles
Sir Corle' day one, don't you know S.U.C
Get your mind right brick, when you fucking with me

[Hook]
I'm so gangsta, so motherfucking gangsta
I'm so gangsta, look at me wow
Gangsta walk with me, gangsta walk with me
Gangsta walk with me, gangsta walk with me
Gangsta walk with me, gangsta walk with me
Gangsta walk with me, gangsta walk with me

[Trae]
Gangsta walk with me, gangsta talk with me
Cause blood a 24, gon set it off with me
I'm a G out A.B.N., when I be walking my turf
Real is floating through my blood, since the day of my birth
No set tripping, but see I rep the blue and the grey
On the side they call the West, and niggas moving they gay
Full speed but moving slow, cause ain't no time for no case
But if the laws hit the block, it's always time for a chase
On a hog to Pensacola, Little Rock and the boot
N.Y. on down to Cali, I'ma rep like a troop
H-Town is where I'm from, ain't no mistaking my claim
Red dots on top of chrome, ain't no mistaking my aim
You see I walk it like I talk it, live it how I display it
Pop the trunk on 84's, garunteed that I'ma wave it
Every motherfucking day, and that's the way this shit go
And if you hate the way I do it, that's the way this shit flow

[Hook]
