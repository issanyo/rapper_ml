[Intro]
Come on man, let's get it in
Shit, hold up

[Verse]
I feel live ain't fair from all I've been through
They say time can heal wounds and that's true
Now I'm dreaming, nights prayin' you come through
Knowing you up in heaven, where I'ma run to?
You be replaced, somethin' they can't do
Niggas want this spot knowin' they ain't you
We was a two man team but now it's just me
God got him an angel, I got one too
I remember that night, that's where it all changed
I hate I got that call, I should've been with you
But the fact I wasn't, I still blame myself
Probably still be here, wish I could switch with you
Your little kids gettin' grown now
Nephews fly as hell, tryna roll now
I guess I can't tell 'em shit, they on they own now
Lil motherfuckers always on the phone now
Junior junior a trip, he look just like you
Head first with drama, he fighting just like you
Pat and Corn the same, they rep just like you
Make me kick they ass, they thug just like you
Off the rip, they all gon' go for Trae
So many thoughts, I don't know what to say
Just know I got 'em and ain't no other way
I told you that at the graveyard the other day
Sometimes I hear your laugh when I'm home alone
Other people probably thinkin' that I'm tripped out
Gotta re-evaluate, crew fell apart
I forgot to tell you half them niggas dipped out
It ain't the same without you
Now I'm doing me, reppin' the name without you
Only got a handful left that's ridin'
Everybody else carried on without you, cold ain't it?
Bunch of niggas turned fuck shit, bold ain't it?
All this snake ass shit gettin' old, ain't it?
I ain't forgot when them people came and got Dog
Some of them niggas probably been the one who told, ain't it?
In the ghetto where the dreams get sold ain't it?
I don't even want to fuck around
Got me hurtin' 'cause you ain't around
Either way, 'til death know I'm still down
Jay Two gone too, make sure you keep him with you
Put him under your wing and show him what's right
The way they told me he died, I swear it wasn't right
It had us fucked up all day and all night
I feel like I'm losin' it, loyal to the death and niggas abusin' it
Ridin' blurry but somehow I keep cruisin' it
Life or death, I'm tryna keep me from choosin' it, gotta win
'Til the end you my brother
Lot of other niggas been undercover
Done played positions tryna get out the gutter
For love of bread, they give a fuck about brother
You and I know I got business to handle
You told me finish and I know that I got to
When they see me ain't no way they can't spot you
Dedicated to them niggas who shot you, they time comin'
Word to my babies, I miss you nigga
Know it hurt when I look at your picture
Mama still in tears, can't forget you
The preacher still demand I read through this scripture, amen

[Outro]
You know it's like
Shit ain't been the same since you been gone bro
Hurt or not, you know I gotta rip it mane
I still got the team on my back, it's ABN for life
Don't worry, you know your kids mine man
As well as I know mine yours
You know it's family over everything
I miss you my nigga, love
