[Intro]
I’d like to dedicate this right here (Yea, this right here)
To all my women that going through a struggle
You know I came up to stay
I ain’t immune to the type of pain you’ve been exposed to
So this one right here
I’mma represent for each and one of y’all who have cancer
Yea, let’s go to my single mothers
Raising the house for the kids (no daddies)
Even the ones who’ve been beat up and abused
Break and left for loss
You know? Even the babies out here havin’ babies
I understand this a part of reality
Even my women don’t lie
All for protecting their set

[Verse 1]
He said he’d never touch you again
He left you prayin’ for the lord to get richer
A thousand tears leaving your face for every time that he hits her
Still so far from happy days but nowhere close to a smile
Try my good what affected you this shit in front of your child
Everything inside your heart telling you pack up and go
But the hardest thing out your life is tryna walk out that door
Cuz once you leave you know it ain’t no turning back, you gotta move on
Don’t worry ‘bout the stressing because you know that you strong
Go sit to a queen therefore you kind now put that shoe on
And walk in it with pride for all the pain and hurt that you saw
Come on! Past situations got you with your head lower
Looking at the girl in the mirror you swear you don’t know ‘er
They strugglin’ makes a woman at a faster rate
Even if she spiritually damaged it make her spirit great
Give me a chance, a real nigga step into the place
Set shine to whole before it’s too late

[Hook]
Baby girl dry your eyes, you gotta try to keep it together
They told me pain don’t last forever
Instead of raining tears away they think you gotta pray to get better
The sun gon shine on you no matter the weather
It ain’t a day to come that I don’t wanna see you smile
I know you on a road that won’t be endin’ for a while
I’mma hally at the homie at above for ya on your head
Real niggas got love for ya

[Verse 2]
I know you goin’ through it for real
So words can’t express how I feel
Each and every one of your struggles makes you one in a mill
I know it’s hard bein’ alone raising a house full of kids
And every day you do your best to try to handle your bizz
Not knowin’ how you gon survive so you turn to strippin’ or drugs
Couple pills to compensate in the place of lookin’ for love
It don’t matter where you been, you just need to know where you goin’
You wearin’ your body red, I’m tellin’ ya cuz it’s showin’
Everybody get a second chance plus it ain’t no room to be a victim of a circustance
You’re something special, Jesus put you here to handle pressure
He’d make that, listen, if you think you’re slippin’ He won’t let ya
And do the babies even know that weak ass daddies love ‘em? They steal the blisten
They angels in disguise that’s why I ride without a question
If you ever catch a person tryna treat you like trash
Halla at me, I’d come kick their ass

[Hook]
Baby girl dry your eyes, you gotta try to keep it together
They told me pain don’t last forever
Instead of raining tears away they think you gotta pray to get better
The sun gon shine on you no matter the weather
It ain’t a day to come that I don’t wanna see you smile
I know you on a road that won’t be endin’ for a while
I’mma hally at the homie at above for ya on your head
Real niggas got love for ya

[Verse 3]
Ain’t no way to take back a life full of drama
Speaking for the streets, I must apologize
Don’t think you’re alone, I lost 2 sisters to a homicide
This my testimony to let you know how much you mean
You can be whatever you dream
You gotta know that you’re better than this so stop with the lies
You say it’s all good, I can see the doubt in your eyes
I know you’re fightin’ for your life so why you actin’ surprised?
You gotta wake up ‘fore you end up somewhere hospitalized
And I don’t wanna see it
I know the rain is so familiar, step inside, take a seat
Let it out until they feel your son is on the way
And through the faith you bound to see the better days
That there’s enough to get you move like in so many ways
That’s why I dedicate this song for the life that you been through
And every obstacle in life that you might just run into
You made too many, who can fill up your space?
So you deserve to put a smile on your face
Come on

[Hook]
Baby girl dry your eyes, you gotta try to keep it together
They told me pain don’t last forever
Instead of raining tears away they think you gotta pray to get better
The sun gon shine on you no matter the weather
It ain’t a day to come that I don’t wanna see you smile
I know you on a road that won’t be endin’ for a while
I’mma hally at the homie at above for ya on your head
Real niggas got love for ya
