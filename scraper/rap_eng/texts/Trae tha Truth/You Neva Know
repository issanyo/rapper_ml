[Hook: Lil Boss]
I be on my grind
I be on that, I be on that full clip in my 9
I be on that break a whole make a of kush all down to dimes
Niggas ain't looking for the good good, smoke to them hoes that are on the east side
Tell them hoes I'm in the east bay
Tell them hoes that I'm with hoes, Jose in the Uhaw truck, finna ship that yay
Tell them hoes that I got that pack, fat dope man I rolled that back
In the strip club with them racks
Oh no I got that sack

[Bridge: Lil Boss]
Play the game baby , make you do something strang
For a piece of a change baby
Bitch I don't do kiss and tell, don't say no names baby
I throw that ass under the [?]
You fuck, you suck, you suck then that's the mission if you with is
Gangsta Gibbs

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
Manouvering through a block full of gangsters
Where they mark their territory like Picasso, spray [?] is a danger
Ever since I got up and got out my major
I was dedicated dreaming on the floor
But now the floors I walk's the elevator
[?] penthouse, graduated the rent house
40 stories above the bucket niggas tryna get out
Policy guarantee, haters get the messages sent out
Pull up on em then go the fuck in, that's what I've been bout
Exquisite taste, somewhere in the gyp to match to my ego
200k, hit the valley, match up my amigo
Some were lost to something engine move at the speed of light
Bitch get exposed on site, don't know where she gon' be tonite
Eh, that's so God I bless their game
Take em out of ratchet
Re-design em in something they call some change
Even if I switch up on em, you highness they will adapt it
[?] and hit the trap just to tell em the papers taken

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mug]
Elegant thug, 100k in that Louis luggage
I'm big pimping like Pimp C in the Gucci bucket
My coupe disgusting, lil Weezy voice yuh
Mercy with the doors up, not Yeezy it's ya boy yuh
Bang, dragon gang in this thang nigga
Peace [TV?] watch in the chain, Johnny Dang nigga
Gallery in the shop up in pop up, Vercase frame nigga
Can't flip a bricks in the back of the Range nigga, I'm a [?] nigga
And I'm an asshole by nature
Selling that Big Daddy Kane on the block, they call the vapours
Houston, Cali, Vegas, ballin' out, fuck yu haters
Like Bron , I took my talents down south for that paper
Shout out to Chief and J. Prince, your nigga been paid since
Hear Mase, Loubuitton spikes and suede shit
Your nigga went from cooking hard rock in the basement
To rocking mics with the ankle bracelet, gangster
