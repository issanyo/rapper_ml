[Hook: Z-Ro]
Too many problems on my mind
Living shife is starting to be a full time grind
I'm just trying to live my life
But somehow peace is something I'll never find
Too many problems on my mind
Living shife is starting to be a full time grind
I'm not trying to lose my life
But if I do, I wanna' meet Jesus Christ

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
I never thought that I would have to be back like this
But my pain never let me get away
I don't wanna' be up under the grave
But every time I turn around
There ain't another nigga safe where I stay
I know I can't get around it, cause it's a part of life
And everybody got to go sometimes
80% of my niggas dead, the other 10 locked
The last 10, around here crying
Lord I feel like this can't be fair to a nigga
But I know that I got to make due
Too many situations will put a brick wall up on a nigga
But either way I got to make it through
I know a lot of shit come my way, but it's ok
I know it probably could've been a lot worse
I ain't dead, I ain't in a hearse
But still I got to deal with the fact that a nigga feeling curse
I need to let it out, so I spit it in a verse
And it ain't too safe, but it's stuck in my chest
Now a days, I don't even wanna' answer my cell phone
Cause that's bad news at it's best
Fuck rest, I never ever seen peace
Unless it was a piece that I was packing on the block
Hard times ain't too far, that's why I stay strapped
And pray to God so that he can make it stop
Shife ain't the way that a nigga wanna be
But circumstance can get a nigga put up in a cross
I don't wanna' take another loss
But a nigga stress got me looking teary eyed when I floss
Death ain't never been a friend of mine in my life
And I bet that nigga know my name
I've been fighting with his ass for 24 years
And with the way shit look, ain't nothing gon' change

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I got my phone call the day my nigga done got hit with a bid
Probably for the things that he did
I don't wanna' see my nigga doing time
And he said I was all that he had, with his wife and his kids
How the fuck am I supposed to deal with that?
Plus my nigga never did nothing wrong
Now I gotta know my nigga locked up in a steel cage
With a thought that he never coming home
I don't wanna' feel certain shit, but I know that I got to
I never knew why I got to run to a nigga
All I ever wanted was a piece of mine
Plus I got fate but I feel like it ain't coming to a nigga
Every other day, my little boy sick
But I'm getting strong every time I see him smile
I don't give a fuck what them folks telling me bout Nick
They can never understand my child, plus Little Gerald ain't mine
But I promised to God for them two, I'll put it on the line
They the only ones left that remind me of me
Long as they live, I give a fuck if I'm dying
I remember, back when Nicky got that time
My nigga Ship helped me to maintain
To put up my fucking nigga who lost his T-Jones
I know it's only right for me to go and do the same
I gotcha', I ain't finna' let nothing happen to ya' my nigga
Just know that ya' gotta stay strong
Look at all the bullshit I go through
Probably only one-eight off it make it to a song
Something, I put up then I go into a zone
With a attitude niggas better leave me alone
Ain't too many other ways a nigga understand
Unless this man put a hot slug in his dome

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trae The Truth]
Motherfuckers never understand why I feel like I do
Until they start to get it like I do
Everybody now a days, think they can take it like I do
But never see the shit I go through, I been a grown man
How the fuck am I supposed to cope
Watching my nigga laying stretched out
Shit be so close, I don't know who gonna' be next to go
That's why guerrilla stay stressed out
I don't wanna' do time in a pen for me killing a nigga
But I ain't finna' let 'em broke me off
Plus Dickey taught me not to ever let a nigga get close
So they can never get to fuck me off
My nigga we do it Ag-town in the street it fucking me up
Cause they fam with the wrath of Trae
And every time I spit it out for the hood
I be repping the squad, and let 'em know that I be blue over grey
I ain't been around much, but I swore my niggas on my mind
And I don't wanna' be by myself
And I don't know who to trust when I hit the block by myself
So I proceed to be by myself, and every time I get sad
I'm in the zone all by myself and so I gotta' roll by myself
And I don't need no friend no bitch, so I find myself
I'm in the class all by myself, I'm on they ass all by myself
Stress run at me like a relay
Plus I never get to win, I really don't wanna' sin
But I know if I want to survive and lead back to the dividends
I hope God get to hear a nigga cry, as time goes by
And I can finally get to ease my mind
But for now I gotta' deal with the life that I don't wanna' deal
And hope everything'll be fine
