[Verse 1 - Trae Tha Truth]
All black whip but the flow kick
I'm the King of the streets, what you know bitch
If you say I ain't the King, you don't know shit
Yeah nigga, other niggas doing ho shit
Greenlight everybody on go bitch
Bitch in the backseat tryna blow shit
But I'm on some mo shit, run up in yo door shit
Tryna get this money, everybody on they floor shit
I'm on the ?, strapped like John Wayne
Then put a price on your head for a little change
I can bomb a nigga block with a little aim
Bout to Dedicate a 5 like Lil Wayne
I'm on that OG Bobby Johnson shit
In a drop ?, I'd done lost my shit
Niggas say you on, like a bunch of bright lights
My niggas tryna off ya shit
I burn a bitch up, no propane
Put fire on they ass like little flames
I got this bitch locked down, no chains
And let the people come and get this nigga, no names
6 rings on like MJ, I'ma tense these niggas like sensei
Shit if you ask me, niggas been gay
You wanna get famous nigga say Trae


[Verse 2 - T.I.]
Ok, we started catching felonies in Bankhead
Riding through the hood in a hot box
Its ‘96, n I swear I had a trap house
Every day cut school to sell crack rock
I gotta pistol in the pocket and a bank roll
Anybody try me I'ma let the thang go, bust it
I put a whole clip where ya Kangol, cousin
And Yo Homie don’t like it but he can’t do nothing
Came through busting, And respect that
You violated mandatory nigga, bet that
Walk up, pull out a Smith and Wesson, push ya Wig back
Now the undercover askin people if we did that
They came with the OG’s hanging, OZ’s slanging
Styrofoam, double cup, codeine drinking
You run up on me wrong the .44 be bangin
Meet you at the Crossroad where they don’t be sanging


[Hook - Que]
Word on the street I'm a suspect
Hangin' with the killers in the projects
Potato on the barrel keep quiet (shh)
Catch a nigga slippin' from behind (boom)
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!


[Verse 3 - Que]
Hundred bands on your head get the job done
Throw it up throw it up nigga where ya from
Whole hood hot cause ya nigga hittin' licks
Ain't made a mil yet but it's still nigga rich
Stick em up stick em up stick em (stick em up)
How ya want it nigga? Full or the semi
Lurkin' for the cash, searchin' for the bag
Young nigga wildin', throwin' up flags
Shooters on the roof with a scope (boom boom)
Money make em treat ya like the pope (like a king)
Work the block like Dikembe in the post (cook em up)
Nigga hit it with the fork (hit it)

O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
