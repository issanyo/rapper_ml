[Intro: Lil Duke]
Yeah, YSL shit, true facts, ya dig?

[Hook: Lil Duke]
Nigga we get it, we get it
My niggas, yea turn to a 50
Calling my niggas, they with it
Pull up, 8 shots at yo' [?]
Most of these niggas, they with it
Niggas be falling in love with these bitches
Niggas they act just like hoes, in they feelings
Mind on the money and I want a million
I'm trying to stack that shit tall as a building
Ferrari come through the hood with no ceiling
I'm not a rapper, bitch I am a dealer
Sipping on lean and I hope it don't kill me
Pour up that lean and we don't even measure it
Young nigga came from that hood, I'm a veteran
I had to break on the cops, I was selling it
Running with nothing but felonies

[Verse 1: Lil Duke]
Don't speak on my name 'bout that broke shit, irrelevant
Racks on me just like I just got a settlement
We putting dick in yo' bitch cause she know that we ball
Sweep her the wrong number when she asks can she call
5 or 10 racks when we ball
5 or 10 racks in the mall
Don't talk to rats, they get off
Cashing then backing right out
Soon as we walk in they wildin'
Fans, they screaming, they rowdy
Bitch, I been trapping the Audi's
Push button with the frog lights
Sipping like I'm straight from Texas
Drinking lean, pouring dark Sprites
Fucked up a check and I got it right back
If I ever fall, Thugger got my back
For a little nothing, I can get a nigga wet
Pop, they with that MAC, I'ma hop out and get it cracking

[Hook: Lil Duke]
Nigga we get it, we get it
My niggas, yea turn to a 50
Calling my niggas, they with it
Pull up, 8 shots at yo' [?]
Most of these niggas, they with it
Niggas be falling in love with these bitches
Niggas they act just like hoes, in they feelings
Mind on the money and I want a million
I'm trying to stack that shit tall as a building
Ferrari come through the hood with no ceiling
I'm not a rapper, bitch I am a dealer
Sipping on lean and I hope it don't kill me
Pour up that lean and we don't even measure it
Young nigga came from that hood, I'm a veteran
I had to break on the cops, I was selling it
Running with nothing but felonies

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I am the streets, so we think nothing higher
Shooting out something that crawl like a spider
Money get beat, what the fuck I desire
Take flight like a pilot, won't be nothing flyer
I know these fuck niggas sing like the choir
Run up on Truth, I can help you kids fire
Burn 'em like the tires, when I'm moving by ya
Told 'em I was thugging, tripping I'ma try ya
I do not want to talk
Make you run in that safe like you Marshall Faulk
Take you right to the plug, nigga fuck a drought
Hit the ghetto like, look what the fuck I bought
Anyplace that can make guarantees, I called it
All this shit on my neck dripping like a faucet
Nigga, water water, don't know what it costed
I'm a fool, you can tell how these haters lost it
I'm the business
Nigga this'll be my year
Thinking different I might pull up on ya
I'm a gangster nothing I can fear
Hit up Duke and Slime and run that gun up on ya
I am [?] nigga don't forget it
All across yo' head, you'd think I was [?]
Straight up out of Texas, look at how I kick it
Swingers on the Phantom, look at how I sitted

[Hook: Lil Duke]
Nigga we get it, we get it
My niggas, yea turn to a 50
Calling my niggas, they with it
Pull up, 8 shots at yo' [?]
Most of these niggas, they with it
Niggas be falling in love with these bitches
Niggas they act just like hoes, in they feelings
Mind on the money and I want a million
I'm trying to stack that shit tall as a building

I'm not a rapper, bitch I am a dealer
Sipping on lean and I hope it don't kill me
Pour up that lean and we don't even measure it
Young nigga came from that hood, I'm a veteran
I had to break on the cops, I was selling it
Running with nothing but felonies
