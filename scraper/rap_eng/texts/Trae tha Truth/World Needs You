Yeah
[Verse 1]
I know you feel like it get hard at times
It’s like the world against ya or somethin’
Just gotta understand, it get better one day
We never get nothin’ we can’t handle
I want you to know that
Tears in the mirror
Reflection of some distress
No sign of happy days around
But still tryin’ to give it the best
She only pray to feel the smile
Of a blessed child
She travelin’ the journey
Of the finished then [?] smiles
But tears she runnin’
A single mother
You’re the part-time father
Baby father in the cell
He was a part-time robber
Her family don’t even claim her
All she got for help is God
Hard score, so many turned fraud on her
That made it, but I tell her
Never give up
The sun ain’t far away
Though it’s dark, you gotta find another way
Pray
You deserve the best
No longer be another victim
Got to do this for your kids
Heavy or not, you gotta lift ‘em
Hold your head, baby
You feel you can’t do it alone
I know you’re scared, baby
You give anything for your life
That’s what you said, baby
And you can do it
You just gotta believe
No matter what you have to face
Just know you gotta achieve

She used to walk on water
(Water)
Now she walks right into traffic
(Traffic)
She used to dream of livin’
(Livin’)
Now she swears that she’s had it
(Had it)
She’s had it all up to here
There’s no comin’ down
It turned it up all this year
She’s not tryin’ to come around
So I say
The world needs you
The world needs you
(Hold your head up)
The world needs you
Needs you
Needs you
(You can do it, baby)
The world needs you
It needs you
(Hold your head up)
The world needs you
Needs you
Needs you
(You can make it through it)

[Verse 2]
You know, I apologize for everything you been through
Guess that’s why I’m speakin’ up right now
(Speakin’ up right now)
Check it
Contemplate
Overdosin’ on drugs
Wishin’ to disappear
Not knowin’ what direction
She headin’
She forced to live in fear
Wishin’ she could fly away
Her spirit told her
Try today
Tears cryin’ the river
Holdin’ hope
Before it die today
Angel of a storm
Someone searchin’ for a better life
Her pain keep goin’ deeper
Like they hit her with a bitter knife
I know it’s hard
You gotta let go
And give in to God
Smile through everything
The devil send ya
Keep your faith in God
The pain is ugly
But you’re blessed
With a beautiful smile
But you forgot the way it feels
You ain’t smiled in awhile
You’re somethin’ special
I just thought that I’d cheer ya
Even though you spend the life
Wishin’ that somebody heard ya
(Damn)
