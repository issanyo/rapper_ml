[Intro]
Uh, yeah
What's goin' on

[Chorus]
Every nickel dime, every red cent, give me everyting I need
'Cause this rent gotta pay on time, and I got friends and family to feed
So I grind hard 'cause it's not easy
And put my heart in these streets, yeah
So when I wake up this morning
Motive is all about the money yeah
'Cause I'm all about the money, no fame
I'm not all about the running no games
Because I'm coming from the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
Because I'm coming from the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
Because I'm coming from the ghetto, ayy
Because I'm coming from the ghetto

[Verse 1: Snap Dogg]
Just a young nigga, jumpin' off that porch
Niggas dyin' every day, I gotta keep my torch (that thirty)
Niggas tellin' every day, I never speak in court (they snitchin')
And if you hear me when I say this, thanks for your suppport
Bunch of sirens, you hear them baby cries
A bunch of violence, nigga your mama babies dies (man down)
Just a cycle of my block (my block nigga)
Get caught slippin', headshot (headshot nigga)
They on mollies, perkies, xannies, they be off it
Dracos, hundreds, rounds, bullets toxic
Can't be playin' with no fuck nigga (hell nah)
You see the opp like what's up nigga? (what's up nigga?)
Me and my niggas keep close ties (real tight)
We hate them niggas playin' both sides (fake nigga)
If you can't trust 'em put 'em in the dirt (put him down)
But if you love him put him on a shirt (yeah yeah yeah yah)

[Chorus]
Every nickel dime, every red cent, give me everyting I need
'Cause this rent gotta pay on time, and I got friends and family to feed
So I grind hard 'cause it's not easy
And put my heart in these streets, yeah
So when I wake up this morning
Motive is all about the money yeah
'Cause I'm all about the money, no fame
I'm not all about the running no games
Because I'm coming from the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
Because I'm coming from the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
Because I'm coming from the ghetto, ayy
Because I'm coming from the ghetto

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
Where I'm from they say the good die young
And you with or without respect, your bullets don't fly none
Single mother stay out here stressin' while they child run wild
Knowin' one day they might get cold and it's reversin' they smile
I know it's been a while but we say fuck the world and nothin' less, duck and dodge the mess
For the ones they put to rest, no choice but take it to they chest
Everybody out here savages, score without the bandages
Mentally be gone away, you can't repair the damages
I only speak on what I seen, paint the picture how they live
Ain't got shit to give, 'less it's drama, that's just how we live
Either way our lips are sealed, fuck 12, don't run it to 'em
All we know is fight 'til death, all opps, we runnin' through 'em

[Chorus]
Every nickel dime, every red cent, give me everyting I need
'Cause this rent gotta pay on time, and I got friends and family to feed
So I grind hard 'cause it's not easy
And put my heart in these streets, yeah
So when I wake up this morning
Motive is all about the money yeah
'Cause I'm all about the money, no fame
I'm not all about the running no games
Because I'm coming from the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
Because I'm coming from the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
Because I'm coming from the ghetto, ayy
Because I'm coming from the ghetto
