[Hook:]
What the fuck are you on you must be out of your mind
Today why are you calling my phone
You probably don't like what I’m about to say
What in the fuck do you want
What in the fuck are you on

[Verse 1:]
It’s time you never been with those hoes who hyped you
To ever think that i ever had a bitch just like you
Now that i think about it that bitch had to go too
I kept my book closed and told her to rewrite it
Calling my phone but you ain’t nothing to me but bad time
Drawing me out of my life bitch just trying to crash mine
I ain't trying to hit it you worst than a bad rhyme
Probably starting to tweaking like you going off a badline
But niggers still out here trying to stick up on her
Tell the fucking truth you probably trying to down him
Every day i spent with you was well wasted
Trying to get away you only drama
Nobody tell my bitch sex you and not tell her
Then say you for every body like you a cerebellum
Fuck you and fuck love girl I’m a repella
Your life based on bull shit you coudl’nt smell her
Never mess with my business and stay the fuck out of my inbox
All this shit is problem and understand this is where this shit stops
Move girl say another word and you going to get dropped
So put your ass up like a barbershop to get chopped
They say misery loves company
No exceptions for what you done to me
You must be out of your damn mind since you out of line
Now you out the way I’m doing fine

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
There is nothing bitch you going to rewind
You better go ahead
Always running from the real why the fuck you scared now
You only open your mouth i opened you legs
Searching for a way to shine i guess you all about the bread now
It ain't nothing that you were saying that i was trying to hear
All this bullshit that you was doing now kinda make it clear
You bullshit 360 days out of the year
I’m the captain of the ship you ain’t ever goin to stare
Why the fuck are you on my line there is no calling me for time
You better stop it like you a sign
You going to bump into trouble like you were blind
Like how you play the game you out of bind
Trying to keep up with what your homies got your ass working
Fuck up with your head now your ass searching
Ain't nobody out here want you so your ass hurting
So like drunk and in love keep your head surfing
If the shoes fit too late to put on someone else that shit on you
You pointing fingers you better take what you dishing out
It ain’t a way to flip it girl this shit on you
They say misery loves company
No exceptions for what you done to me
You must be out of your damn mind since you out of line
Now you out the way I’m doing fine
