[Intro: John Lee Hooker Sample]
One of these days
Things gonna change
One of these days
Things gonna change
You'll try not baby

[Verse 1: Berner]
19 coked out selling dreams
Empty bottles on my floor
Dope money on my jeans
I was taught how to break a bitch, you see the watch
Yeah, pretty ass payed for this, young and wild
All I see is paper now, I got a fresh ol' bitch out in Vegas now
She don't even play around
I keep pushing while the clocks tickin'
I'm in the club tryna' knock bitches
You see the drop, big chrome rim rollin' round
Stop at the stop sign, big 40 on me
Been a while since I propped mine
All I see is dollar signs when I'm wake
When I sleep I dream about more money in my safe
Top dogs wanna talk prices
I looked her dead in her eyes and
Told her stop lyin'
I Told her baby go and get it
Ugh, act like you don't know me
Got 16 bitches in my line and they're all on me

[Hook: Berner]
Pretty bitches on my line, but when I look deep in their eyes
All I see is dolla signs
I got money in my mind
I'll probably end up
Doing time but all I see is dolla signs
All money ain't good money
But I'm running through this hood money
All I see is dolla signs
Does my future look bright? Ionno
In a hotel room where all I see is dolla signs

[Verse 2: Berner]
No banks, I'mma hide all my bread
Hard to sleep when you might do 5 in the FED's
All I know, I'ma live through these rhymes, when I'm dead
A few suckers got a price on my head
Homie fuck that
I'm on the go tryna' bust this next move
50 pounds, let's go, I'ma get em through
Fake friends wanna see me fail
I'm out of state, no need to mail
I got prices that bring me bills
I'm out in Tucson gettin' busy
Ridin' with my bottom in the trunk full of mitty
No love heartbreaker like suing them
I'm in this cheap hotel just moving them
All I see is dolla signs when I look
In this pretty girl's eyes
The money gets me high
If you want a pack then
You better get in line
I ain't picking up unless it's ten at a time, cash

[Hook: Berner]
Pretty bitches on my line, but when I look deep in their eyes
All I see is dolla signs
I got money in my mind
I'll probably end up
Doing time but all I see is dolla signs
All money ain't good money
But I'm running through this hood money
All I see is dolla signs
Does my future look bright? Ionno
In a hotel room where all I see is dolla signs

[Verse 3: Trae]
New kango, these hoes I kick shit
Trap house building clientele, brick shit
I ain't getting money then that bitch don't get shit
Brother wise words "Fix this shit quick"
Slide through my city, that life I play nice
Certified boss call shots I play lives
Any given, pull up in that hangar and play flights
Somethin' like leave a bitch, just grey tights
All I see is dollar signs, hustle like it's bad news
Cinderella for em, whip, walkin' on these glass shoes
Homey I'm an asshole
Fuck it, we can clash cruise
Popping in the brick a city ride through my last screws
New Rolly, new big faces
Throw back Chuck T's with the big laces
Young nigga keep metal like a bitch braces
Everything first place, nigga fuck races

[Hook: Berner]
Pretty bitches on my line, but when I look deep in their eyes
All I see is dolla signs
I got money in my mind
I'll probably end up
Doing time but all I see is dolla signs
All money ain't good money
But I'm running through this hood money
All I see is dolla signs
Does my future look bright? Ionno
In a hotel room where all I see is dolla signs

[Outro: Berner]
Cash cash cash cash cash cash cash cash
All I see is dolla signs
Cash cash cash cash cash cash cash cash
All I see is dolla signs
Cash cash cash cash cash cash cash cash
All I see is dolla signs
