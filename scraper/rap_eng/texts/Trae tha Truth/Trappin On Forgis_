[Hook: Lex]
Whippin' and I'm trappin' on some Forgis
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Broke ass bitches can't afford this
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nigga call phones when i slide through
I've been that boy since high school
I keep carats they tryna ride with us
But these hoes can't keep ride with us
Young Lex trappin' out the bando
Young Lex shooters got ammo
Young Lex been bout the curb

[Verse 1: Lex]
Keep some bands on me, shawty do your dance on me
Your body ecstasy, lean up next to me

[Hook: Lex]
Whippin' and I'm trappin' on some Forgis
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Broke ass bitches can't afford this
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Trae tha Truth]
Runnin' through a sack like voodoo
Fuckin' up a check get more dough
I was in the whip movin solo
Chain hittin low like a low blow
Mixtape getting copped no robo
Work getting chopped no four door
Fuck these niggas I don't fuck with them
Let my money give it to 'em no homo

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
I was fresh out Texas copped and drop a slick
Yeah these forgis sick I copped a Dr. King
In the streets my queen I chose to lock her
Blueprint it, just like Hov, I chose to Roc her
Money got me stockin, name is poppin'
Coupe today, the whip it ain't for toppin'
Everything'll go it ain't for stoppin'
They say it's my time like I was clockin'
Should've got your money up instead of talkin'
Counting up my pockets while you niggas walkin'
Diamonds on me killin' niggas, get a coffin'
Playing with the water like a set of dolphins
I don't need a hater if it wouldn't off him
Get me more, I hear the flicks
I'm only nicks, like who was next
To sit, you disrespect take off like jets
And end up X'd forreal

[Hook: Lex]
Whippin' and I'm trappin' on some Forgis
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Broke ass bitches can't afford this
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
