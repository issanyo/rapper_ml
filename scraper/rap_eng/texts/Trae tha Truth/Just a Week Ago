(*talking*)
Ay Trae, I thought these niggas wanted to see us make it mayn
But I've been seeing otherwise mayn, but it's all hood though

[Trae]
I guess you niggas forgot, it seems to me that all of my niggas done lost they memories
We use to be so close, inside the same vecinity but shit done changed
It ain't too much clicking, we don't even see the same no mo'
We don't even hit the block to crawl, chopping up game no mo'
Where shit went wrong I really can't tell ya, but I can tell ya I sense it
On top of my game with a bird's eye view, ain't no way I'ma miss it
But when it's told throughout the hood, they say this nigga done changed
Cause I bought a car and bought a house, and got a few diamonds and thangs
But I'll be damned, if I don't get what the fuck I deserve
But I ask my family who I'm rolling, what about what's the word
About how we use to hit them shows, at about 60 deep
And if they don't get in, it's gon be a situation based out of heat
I guess jealousy envy and greed, come with the turf
You know realness is a given, nothing equals what it's worth
But time's flying, I don't feel I wanna get it back
Cause jealous motherfuckers, got me strapped for real

[Hook - 2x]
Damn it was all good, just a week ago
I see them niggas in the streets, we don't speak though
But damn it was all good, just a week ago
Jealousy got me focused, this some'ing you niggas need to know

[Yung Redd]
You can't ever, judge a book by it's cover
I'm only one in a million that came from the gutter, still I prayed for another
Way to get paid, once this street shit played out
A struggle for a hustle, is never a easy trade out
If money, is the root of all evil
My love for these niggas in the streets, runs deeper
Next second you're broke, look how these niggas treat ya
Six feet underground, still I'm my brother's keeper
I'm telling y'all, real talk haters get on your job
Most of these rappers fraud, see they only for sars man
They go for them niggas, riding your co-tail
Might as well throw in the towel, you're not gon sell
It's hurting ya to your heart, see us niggas prevail
All's well and ends well, with some weight in the scale
I'm here to cancel your plans, this one is for the fans
Yeah them fake ass niggas, I ain't stealing my hand naw

[Hook - 2x]
