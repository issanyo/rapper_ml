[Chorus: T.I.]
Stayin' alive sometimes hard work, today
You got a problem, go to God first and pray
That won't He do it, it could always be worse
Every day a good day, when He above the dirt
Another day, another bill that I have to pay
The weed man said he was five minutes away
And that was yesterday
But it could always be worse
Every day a good day when He above the dirt
[Verse 1: RaRa]
I had young thot givin' me top, sittin' in a hotbox
I was 14 years old workin' the Duwop
All eyes on me, nigga, thought I was 2Pac
Fucked the wrong young nigga' girl, I need two Glocks
Tryna' ride drop-top Ville, for the summertime
Young nigga put in work, I had a hundred grand
Lot of niggas pack up  leave, streetlights on
Where the fuck was I gon' go? I had no home
Asked my partner, "Can I come over? Sleep on the sofa?"
Had to get out  grandma crib, I'm no pushover
Treat a nigga like I'm a Orphan
Fussin & arguin
So I need everything that I own, don't do no bargain
Jumped up out the porch, and fell in love with drugs
It was what it was, of course, I'm just a thug
Had to skip them Boy's and Girls  find me a plug
I want big ol' diamonds, and minks, all the allures

[Chorus: T.I.]
Stayin' alive sometimes hard work, today
You got a problem, go to God first and pray
That won't He do it, it could always be worse
Every day a good day, when you above the dirt
Another day, another bill that I have to pay
The weed man said he was five minutes away
And that was yesterday
But it could always be worse
Every day a good day when you above the dirt
Remember that

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
Day for day, dealin' with struggles, I'm nothing new to
Prayin' I could see somethin' better, only a few do
Dreams of pullin' up something foreign, I'm in a Who Do
Solo on the block sweatin' bullets, it's what I'm used to
Pride hit me, all in my feelings, lookin' at niggas win
"How the fuck the Truth gon' make it?"
I'm movin' 3 for 10's
Lookin' like I'm homeless and broke
I'm damn-near out of wind
Aggravated, caught me a robbery, headed to the pen
Feeling like my life hit bottom, it can't go no less
Lost my re-up runnin' from laws, like, "What the fuck next?"
Trappin full-time with work, but ain't got no checks
What the fuck do I got to show? Other than more stress
Older brother stuck in a cell, tellin' me give 'em hell
He ain't have the money for bail, I'm back to work the scale
Told me I should think about rappin'
I told him, "Time will tell"
For now lil bro was reppin' the block
So they would find the smell

[Chorus: T.I.]
Stayin' alive sometimes hard work, today
You got a problem, go to God first and pray
That won't He do it, it could always be worse
Every day a good day, when He above the dirt
Another day, another bill that I have to pay
The weed man said he was five minutes away
And that was yesterday
But it could always be worse
Every day a good day when you He the dirt
Remember that
