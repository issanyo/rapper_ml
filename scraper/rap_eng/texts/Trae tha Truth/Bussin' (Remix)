[Hook: Trouble] x2
Bussin!
They all bussin for Trouble Trouble
They all bussin for Trouble Trouble
They all bussin for Trouble Trouble
OG's, young niggas, niggas younger than them
Bussin!

[Verse 1: Trouble]
Think it's a game, don't advise you put my name on wax
Gooniez shoot off them same lips that put my name on a track
While I just sit back and sing them lullabies (Rockabye baby)
Another pussy die
On the pill I got from Fat Mack strategizing for my empire
I'm a asshole by nature just like Trae Tha Truth it's spitting fire
And I'm not a lie
Want to put me under the test
Then grab the .357 the murder weapon just to let you niggas know I ain't flexin'
No shell casings to pick up so I ain't worried about you catching me
Was taught don't talk about shit so I ain't worried about a snitch
Now I can do like my big homies used to do
Just for the rush with automatics it's a house move don't forget to blast

[Refrain: Trae] x4
Bussin
They all bussin for Trae
They all bussin for Trae
They all bussin for Trae
They all bussin for Trae
OG's, young niggas, niggas than them
Bussin

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I bet they all bussin for this asshole
When it come to Houston I'm the king of the streets
In the bottom where niggas cash is low
I'll put ya in a box if ya don't get low
Fuck with me that's where ya ass will go
Tec-9's, AKs and Mac 9's in the back of the trunk finna crash ya door
Yeah bitch I might ride, wrap ya ass up
Bitch I'm for real, beat ya ass up
Duct tape ya face, stain ya ass up
Put ya in the trunk, bang ya ass up
I don't do the talking, bitch I'm a army
Hood Navy Seal, bet you can't harm me
Lookin for me bitch I'm in the back of the tank on swangas
I bet a muthafucka won't bomb me
I'll be damn if they stoppin this
H-town to A-town I'm hood wit it
For the niggas like to trap or try to bang
Real talk you can tell em I'm good wit it
Bring ya ass to the bottom of the city, bet you ain't gon make it up out it
Every nigga I know represent the same shit I do
Doin they biz get ya ass the fuck out
