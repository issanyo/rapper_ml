[Hook: Meek Mill]
They tryna tell me that I can’t when I know I can
You knock me down, I get up, we gonna go again
Every time them haters see my face like "here we go again"
Cause to the day they take me out, I be going in
Yeah I’ma ride to the motherfucking finish
Because the sky is the motherfucking limit
And I’m on it, I’m on it

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, they try to assassinate, limitate, intimidate
Lock me down at jay way, and gave me a December day
One thing bout my mama, she made sure I had that dinner plate
Scar me when they killed my dad
I was wild like Simba
Remember they, left me there for dead, I ain’t care
I went harder than they did, and went farther than they did
Tell me I can’t just like they did, I’m a grown man about my bizz
I go hard to get what I want, chasing my dreams like Forest Gump
Dreamchaser, but I ain’t going to sleep
24 a day, 7 days a week
48 weeks a year, I ain’t sleeping yeah
Cause I ain’t tryina take no shorts, like the leaping year
Cops try lock me, niggas try leave me there
Road to the riches, homie you should meet me there
Crab in the bow, haters tryina keep me there
But watch me break away, yeah I’ma make a way

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I remember they said I wouldn’t, shit
Told them bitches take it back
Fuck niggas got famous, I waited my time to place the bet
They knew I was coming for it
Fuck your fine make a bet
Everything was dealer, hopping out of something draped in black
Swear the go is something goes sicker, they getting shook
Standing so well over haters, like shut the fuck up and look
They can’t stop a nigga campaign, tell them I’ve been elected
Then it’s robbing on you bitches, I’m playing till I’m ejected
Pussy niggas keep talking, tell them to take a breath
I’ma be here, many using every second left
A bunch of niggas playing fowl, that’s without a ref
You knock me down I’ma keep fighting with you till the death
I made it out the dark now I’m somewhere in the light
The way I’m focus turned a couple niggas syphe
Tell them look at me now, they told me I couldn’t make it
Now I’m king of the streets, I dare your ass to try and take it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Yeah, man I was 16 with big dreams
Coming from a small hood
Homie thirsty, standing on the corner, like it’s all good
Go hard just to feed the team
Make sure that we all good
Niggas maine we stand up they the niggas I’m gonna fall for
All aboard, taking off, once in these taking loss
Telling me I can’t when I can, why you hating, dub?
Faith you try to grab ho, back tinted shake it all
Anything to reach the top, loosing friends and breaking routes
I was born to loose but I was built to win
Before Charlie Macking tip, I was going in
Before the radio, I was gonna have it all
I was in the cell, waiting on the day they’d let me go
Yeah I was playing around, why you wanna play me now
Somebody wanna say somethin’ , you should say it now
To all my haters though, swear I won’t let them down
You know somebody that go hard
Then you should get ‘em now

[Hook]
