[Chorus]
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz

[Verse 1]
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, movin' slow in the Benz
Lookin' at these suckers through these Cartier lens
Reachin' out to God, hope he overlook my sins
Clear sunroofs open up to feel the wind
Feelin' like Khaled, tell them all I do is win
Only countin' racks if they comin' by the tens
Whole world watchin' cause they know I'm settin' trends
I'm King Truth, bitch I'm 'bout it
Streets locked, bitch I got it
See me lose, bitch I doubt it
I'ma check somethin', no deposit
Villains comin' out the closet, probably 'cause they know I'm solid
I ain't there to look and make it, I'ma take flight like a pilot
Like Big Mo, I was chose
Like Derrick, how I Rose
My money long, I expose
Like Jay-Z changin' clothes
I build traps like [?]
I'm still with it, think I'm froze
I'm heavy with it, nothin' light
[?]

[Chorus]
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz

[Verse 2]
I'm back at it, nothin' safe
'Bout ten Summers, played the race
Don't get mad, fix your face
Jump all [?] like I'm Grace
Sick mind, get your place
Trunk floatin' into space
Don't touch mine, check the waist
All black, check the race
I'm representin' Robert Bates, to the whole world, he the greastest
He spot like he Mikey Vegas
He still the king, I'm the latest
Me and Moxiii 'bout to zone out
You don't understand that, you on the wrong route
It's my time, I can't hold out
I bring the heat like it was cold out
No rollout, I'm just ridin'
All black tint like I'm hidin'
Got a new wave, I'm just divin'
Better take your seat 'cause I'm risin'
It's real life, ain't no rhymin'
Everything I got from me grindin'
I be damned I don't get to the top, I was on my way like I'm drivin'
I'm tryna shut down the game
And after that, lead it with fame
Ain't nothin' I got to explain
Just give me that check with a name
And I do not feel I can change
Ain't no reachin', I'm outta your range
I come take you, you think I was strange
Hit the whip and I switch up the frame

[Chorus]
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
