[Verse 1: Wasiu]
I'm tryna kick it with my niggas
At appartment zinboufolie yo we in this
This buzz killin' Italian
Just tryna get up in my business
Son just leave and we straight
Taunting "bro 10 Gs in ya face"
Caution bro cause we deep in the place
R.I.P. is a day is the least I can say
Lemme beast him okay!
So I Called him a bitch then he called me a moolie
Left right then I hit him with a two piece
Not a tooth fairy but a nigga made a tooth leave
Now dood sleep pon the street here's a toonie
Ha! Go damn, I'm a loonie
Rob him and show him the coonery
Unleashing the demon influencing
What did you do to me?
Run me the money and jewelry
Truthfully who gon' save you
A little bit outta character blame the Grey Goose
Just a little bit hard for me
Thank God I got a squad with me
See them niggas in the car with me? They retarded b
Ain't nobody thinkin' properly
Not a thug but will break a nigga bones with harmony yea
Not mechanical, an animal, the Hannibal, a cannibal
Man imma take ya muthafuckin' heart to eat
Imma break him, make him wish he never hated
Your decision, imma finish what you muthafuckas started with me
Bruh, lemme chill on that « tout ça c'est pas Halal »
