[Trae talking]
I'd like to take this time out right now
To set the motherfuckin record straight
How the fuck somebody gonna tell my story for me?
If I ain't mistaken it's only one motherfuckin Trae around this bitch
What the fuck gives you the right to speak on my name
Like you know what fuck goin on with me nigga
Niggas don't know shit, same ol' gossip ass, messy ass shit
Nigga need to speak on your own self nigga, 2 each it's own
Probably shouldn't even give y'all niggas the time of day
But fuck it peep this...

[Verse 1]
Well off the bat let me expose the truth and the matter
It was never no easy task when I was climbin the ladder
But every time I hit the block the hood got somethin to say
Whether Houston on down to Austin they stay speakin on Trae
Shit they probably want me in jail cause I keep somethin to spray
I tryed to chill but they showed me that it ain't no other way
Me and my kin folk don't even get to smile that much
I guess everybody hate the fact that we be grindin so much
And I ain't mad cause I figured it was comin one day
I can't even trust no niggas or no woman today
I could've swore everybody said they was proud of a nigga
But act differant when they hit the other side and they clown on a nigga
But I ain't bothered unless a nigga really disrespectin
Then ain't no more talkin till they ass get taught a lesson
2 each it's own so why they wanna act like they know mine
They probably think that they know me cause they listen to my rhymes
Peep this I ain't get no love from nobody
Other rappers thought they was better we was broker then everybody
Only person who helped me and Ro was my nigga Roc
And all of my niggas that's still affilated from the block, non stop
Cause I got some niggas ridin my back
Until the Lord come back to get me I'll be guidin the pack
And it ain't hard cause every one of them is my family
Loyalty till the death and that's why niggas can't stand me

[Hook-Trae + Shyna]
Fuck what you thinkin niggas really don't know me
Still I keep singin get the fuck away from me
Fuck what you thinkin niggas really don't know me
Still I keep singin get the fuck away from me

[Shyna sings till end]
