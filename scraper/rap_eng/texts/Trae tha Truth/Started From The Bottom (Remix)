(Hook)

Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here

(Verse 1)
Now I done kept it real straight out the gate, do what niggas didn’t
10 seconds out the struggle just enough to make niggas different
I used to give a fuck but now the fucks I gave and kill no mo
Everybody snakes like they ain’t know you from the day before
Look here, I’ve been focused, I ain’t worried bout the smaller shit
Man before anything, getting good, I ain’t called the shit
Walkin on my own two, regardless what I go through
Speakin on niggas tryna get famous that’s what I don’t do
Validated the street’s credibility, can’t get to back
To front another gutter gorilla, I came and took that
15 years I’ve been in this motherfucker ain’t left yet
Good hearted nigga, others play 30 like ain’t sweep yet
I started from the bottom now I’m here, made it on my own
Other niggas hope I get distracted, I’mma make it home
Even as a kid I skipped the playground, hit the block and rolled
Might do this shit with passion but to others it’s another song

(Hook)
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here

(Verse 2)
I done kept it real from the jump
Living at my mama’s house we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was trying to get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think its funny how it goes
Now I’m on the road, half a million for a show
And we...


(Hook)
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga

(Verse 3)
Boys tell stories about the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it, nigga
I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much I hear that's poppin' off without us, nigga
We just want the credit where it's due
I’ma worry about me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I’m in the house
Cause we...

(Hook)
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga

(Bridge)
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?
We don’t like to do too much explaining
Story stays the same I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don’t like to do too much explaining
Story stay the same through the money and the fame
Cause we...

[Verse 4]
Came in the game and I’m landing the changes
These fuck niggas they say it in 10 different ways, then see you just smile in yo face
You wanna meet up, name a time or a place
I’m smoking that fire, my nigga you that it’s fire
You smell it as soon as I blaze
A bird in the pound, bird in the pound, bird in the pound
Yea, it’s going down, it’s going down, it’s going down
Uh, started from the bottom now we here
Had a dream bout a car, I went and got it in a year
All black trucks when we pull up to the lear
All black coupe, I look like Bruce when I’m steerin
Hope the homey Dre don’t get pissed but niggas
Never ever put your man on songs like this
And I probably said no to it before
But I made 20 millions so we should probably go on tour
And I just seen Waka the other day
He wasn’t trippin, we just talked about the money we been makin
‘Cause we…

[Hook]
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here
