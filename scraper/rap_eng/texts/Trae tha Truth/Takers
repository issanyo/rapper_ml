[Intro: Trae tha Truth]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Quentin talk to 'em

[Pre-Hook: Quentin Miller]
Yeah, turn up like they can't do, go up like they can't do
Yeah, one three one seven and Trae tha Truth
My whip is the latest, but they want my latest
We on Kelly Slater, let's wave-o, let's wave-o, let's wave-o
Oooh

[Hook: Quentin Miller]
Nobody did us no favors
You fuckin' with takers, you fuckin' with takers
We see what we want and we take it
You talkin' to a taker

[Bridge: Quentin Miller]
Walked in to your function, it's bottles at the table
I might stand on the table, if I break it I can pay for it
I buy my daughter Jordans, just to go to daycare
We really beat the pavement, we don't ask we take shit

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
I'm straight outta Houston the whip i got ridin' screw
Back of it bangin' like something it's red or blue
Don't talk to me nigga, if I do not talk to you
My bitch got a bitch so I might just get head or two
Band after band I can show you just what to do
Symptoms of the flu if Truth end up next to you
Yeah bitch I'm clean if I'm you I'll be hating too
I don't get service, no calling
I'm back to back like Miami, I'm balling
I rep Texas in a foreign, so often
Tell 'em hoes no, cause my ceiling keep falling
Me and my G, hit the club it's on me
Fuck a section buy the whole V.I.P
Fuck your money, it ain't nothing to me
Truth getting outta traffic like my name goalie
Goal and shooting at your bitch, I never aim wrong
When I'm legal, I collect them like a payphone
And when I finish hit the uber, only way home
Ain't no point of calling me your time has expired
Nigga I'm a pimp get a bunny tell her she high
She ain't getting rack after rack tell her she fine
Baby I'm the streets, every corner how I required

[Hook: Quentin Miller]
Nobody did us no favors
You fuckin' with takers, you fuckin' with takers
We see what we want and we take it
You talkin' to a taker

[Bridge 2: Trae tha Truth]
I might just ride the chopper
Or I'mma sing to ya like the opera
All white, Cindy Lauper
Jumpman on my hopper
Bowlegged as if I clock ya
Somebody better stop ya
Fuck niggas I'm a watcha
Hundred bands in the locker

[Hook: Quentin Miller]
Nobody did us no favors
You fuckin' with takers, you fuckin' with takers
We see what we want and we take it
You talkin' to a taker

[Outro: Trae tha Truth]
Did us no favors nigga
You fuckin' with takers
We take it, we take it, we take it, we take it, we take it
Yeah
