Bussin!
They all bussin for Trouble-Trouble
OG's, young niggas, niggas younger than them
Bussin!
They all bussin for Trouble-Trouble

[Verse 1: Trouble]
One thing I'll never understand is
How could a man be afraid of another man
Who bleed the same as you and I can
It's just with me you'll see more niggas than a NFL huddle
Grandmas, uncles, aunties, sisters,cousins and brothers
And they all bussin for Trouble
Younnguns going off straight yam like y'all ready to cut you
With a machete - fuck you! And any other nigga
Who sneak dissin get yo people missin
Don't want no noboby to be scared
Just be prepared
The situation goons go get your dimes, tell em do as I say
I said betta scream my name, pussy den tuck ya chain
And it's a shame, cause you thought it was just my youngins dat shoot
Surprised to see trouble was jumpin too (BUSSIN)

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]

Any nigga go against the king
Kill a nigga by any means
Nigga try to run but couldn't duck the beam
CMG nigga dats the team

Gunpowder, shells jump out, hit the ground
Pussy ass rappers keep talkin den man down
Duct tape, what up trouble, 100
Man they rap about it but none of these niggas done it
The hood, I'm from it
And if I catch a murder one, I'm runnin
You snitchin, I'm comin
What's a nigga with some money without a team
Pussy ass nigga ain't no real nigga gene
Gunplay, every time I step out on the scene
Yellow tape, niggas shouldn'ta never crossed the king
Murder rate, risin its the highest you ever scene
Funeral, pinch yoself, bitch this not a dream
And all I'm doin is bussin

[Hook-Trouble]

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame}
It ain't nothin to me
Shit I get it done
Try to run pump to ya back like Bobby Johnson son
Ok, these niggas talkin murda
I'm the type to hit they mama wit the fuckin burner
Beat a bitch and call me Ike Turner
I'm from the Grove we get stripes if we burn ya
I earn ya that mean DOA
When the fo's pull up, they gon say flock don't play
Bussin, on that grove man they bussin
Upperdale, rex road man they bussin
I'm from Clayco nigga squad give the say so nigga
You ain't bout no murda you talkin out ya A-hole nigga

[Hook-Trouble]

[Verse 4: Trae Tha Truth]
They all bussin for Trae (4x)
OG's, young niggas, niggas than them
They all bussin for Trae (4x)
OG's, young niggas, niggas than them
Bussin

I bet they all bussin for this asshole
When it come to Houston I'm the king of the streets
In the bottom where niggas cash is low
I'll put ya in a box if ya don't get low
Fuck with me that's where ya ass will go
Tec-9's, AKs and Mac 9's in the back of the trunk finna crash ya door
Yeah bitch I might ride, wrap ya ass up
Bitch I'm for real, beat ya ass up
Duct tape ya face, stain ya ass up
Put ya in the trunk, bang ya ass up
I don't do the talking, bitch I'm a army
Hood Navy Seal, bet you can't harm me
Lookin for me bitch I'm in the back of the tank on swangas
I bet a muthafucka won't bomb me
I'll be damn if they stoppin this
H-town to A-town I'm hood wit it
For the niggas like to trap or try to bang
Real talk you can tell em I'm good wit it
Bring ya ass to the bottom of the city, bet you ain't gon make it up out it
Every nigga I know represent the same shit I do
Doin they biz get ya ass the fuck out
