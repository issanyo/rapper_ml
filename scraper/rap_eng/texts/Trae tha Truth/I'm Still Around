Hope you're listening while I'm still
Around


It's hard to deal wit people when they said
It was love
But wasn't nothing shown
I know ain't nothing promised & so I
Talked to God before my life is gone
I guess I'm gettin old
Because I tell myself I gotta write my
Wrongs
I don't believe in lies
I had to see the truth when all the hype
Was gone
Tryna find a way to smile
I got a child on the way
If i can get my problems
Let 'em pile for today
Knowing inside that I deserve
Everything
That I got forreal It's kind of hard
Being Trae
Still I pray I got to do my
Best
All these situations ain't gon let
Me rest
How they did me dirty really
Hurt my spirit
Hit me in my heart guess I
Forgot my vest
Livin my life instead I'm watchin it
Walk by
Lookin at people as only hopin they
Stop by
Missin my brother I'm really hopin
He stop by
I know he dead but see together
We got by
Me and you you and me
We all we got
We can still here but the
Team was fallin out
Up in Heaven man I hope
He was smiling out
Devil working  when I see
Em I call em out
Messed up lil Steve got
25
Think he still In a cell doin
Life
Dog still overseas messed
Up
Lord knows I was still ridin
Until they do em right
I'm out my breathe but I
Gotta fight it
I can't hide it ain't
Nothin in me excitin
Ain't  no point to reach out
Everyone denied it
Ain't no point to speak on
Em I know they tried it
What's on my brain I don't
Know where to start
I'm just tryna be stronger
I can't show no weakness
I gotta keep movin
They say it's my time
But the wait gettin longer
And I cannot take it at
All
Why they don't answer my
Calls
Thought they was my people guess it was dead
When you ain't been official
Might beef about this 1
When they motive is lethal
I want  to live gotta legacy
Lifted
I need to see it wait keep pressing my back
Till I'm up the hill
Know I gotta keep movin no sittin
Still
Truth you gotta keep no sittin still

Everything that I got you can have
