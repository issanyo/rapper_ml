[Trae / Wycelf Jean:]
(Tell them the truth, the truth)*
I had too
You know as I sit here
Just me and this guitar playing
(Tell them the truth, the truth)
I feel the need to spazz out for a minute

[Verse 1:]
I'm on this pen and pad prize so I'm far away
Going to a change but unable to take my scars away
I speak the truth please expected I'm bout to go in
Father forgive me for the storm as I bout to begin
I look at those I thought was friends only shaking my head
Disappointed they ain't stayed real without them being scared
But then I find myself knowing I can't put faith inside of nothing but the homie above
(Nothing but the homie above)
But what's crazy I ain't never ask him for nothing but supporting so they hold me some love
(Supporting so they hold me some love)
People askin whether support for other Houston rappers
I tell em nowhere and truthfully it ain't a factor
It's too the point when I'm around they act like they don't see me
But I'm the streets and everything that cross it gotta see me
Instead of standing for the truth they worried bout getting they records played
Knowing nothing guarantee or make record stays
Was kinda funny niggas know I'm getting fucked over
But they act like they don't see nothing so quit to roll the fuck over
97.9 feel I should be banned for life
But I'm a fighter for my city I'm a stand for life
This is my land for life this Houston till the death of Trae
I still remain a fighter place for those who left away
They say the music that I'm make is getting people killed
How the fuck is that my music showing what was real

[Hook x2: Wycelf Jean]
The radio won't play this
They call it rebel music
How can you abuse it?
Children are mosaic

[Verse 2: Trae]
I'm in the community daily just to feel they pain
And show em when they under pressure how to fight the rain
And if I'm guilty for that then fuck it I deserve it
Tell em goin and shoot the ceilings tell me I'm a servant
Bad for radio because the power of my words
They hope that one day they see me fly away like the birds
They wanna do me like they did the cracker nuts and Brandy
But you can't fire me from Houston see they understand me
I told em with or without the lawsuit I'm here to fight
I ain't goin fall for anything I'm here for what was right
My music still gonna be filled after I'm long away
That probly why so many might just throw this song away

[Hook x4: Wycelf Jean]
The radio won't play this
They call it rebel music
How can you abuse it?
Children are mosaic
Tell them the truth, the truth
Tell them the truth, the truth
Tell them the truth, the truth
