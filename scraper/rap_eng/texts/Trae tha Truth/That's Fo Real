That's for real (8x)*

[Verse 1:]
Another day drama got me going through it eyes fighting me to open
Dreaming the way the struggle knowing everything is broken
Pain sweat and tears let me soaking
Now I'm feeling like I'm losing on some shit that got me contemplating smoking
Inhaling off the light looking at these haters like I owe em
Pressing something like a bomb ten seconds from try'na blow em
Never turn another cheek, pride goin make a nigga show em
Niggas got something to say now it's fuck em like I don't know em
All I ever tried to do was make a way for me and grind
It ain't been anything less for a decent amount of time
Extra time to searching for a position they couldn't find
They disregard being loyal like it's something they left behind
Homie you goin do your thang I'm goin do mine
Keep ya rather distance for the shit I'm packing two crimes
Niggas say it was love but now I see the love they had lay in a hersh
It safe to say they love for hate focus to see me doing worse

[Chorus:]
When hard times seem to find you (that's for real)
When niggas find yourself behind you (that's for real)
When in the days barely find you (that's for real)
And all you know is how to make it through (that's for real)
If you broke shit straight then ya making love money
Errbody wanna say they ain't changed
But every motherfucker thank every other motherfucker
Goin knock em I think position in the game

[Verse 2:]
I hate to say to believing in niggas got me disappointed more than ever
How the fuck they something real knowing they lie about whatever
They do know about loyalty all they know about is cheddar
All they hate was tuck away till they thought I was doing better
But I still hold it together with no one what I had been through
Everything I'm about enough to show I never been you
Disrespecting your homie it's something I don't get into
Being real ain't nothing practice in something already in you
Dawg told me watch at a distance load up and fall back
Soon as they show they colours expose em and never call back
Never forget the way that they done ya remember all that
Other than definition of pussy is where they falling
And if so they playa hide layout
They know I'm where the streets at, you other niggas not me so stay out
They pray my enemies take out the truth for what I spoken
I see the snakes no longer in the grass they in the open

[Chorus: x2]
When hard times seem to find you (that's for real)
When niggas find yourself behind you (that's for real)
When in the days barely find you (that's for real)
And all you know is how to make it through (that's for real)
If you broke shit straight then ya making love money
Errbody wanna say they ain't changed
But every motherfucker thank every other motherfucker
Goin knock em I think position in the game
Is it real? [x7]
