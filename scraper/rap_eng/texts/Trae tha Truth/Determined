[Verse 1]
It's been hard to enjoy a smile when your life all trash
Most of my people flew to heaven damn I still ain't packed
I been searching for better days like my shit been jack
My last five been hell I’m just trying to get that back
I done built one hell of a story trying to get that sack
So many nights hanging on corners like a fucked up wreck
With everything falling apart I'm trying to keep shit intact
I pray I don't go in reverse and have to whip that crack
I done witnessed too many switches so my days don't trust shit
My spirit stay under pressure trying to hold so much
Devil around the corner guess he still on that fucked shit
Been fighting since I was 12, hell I still ain't done shit
Everyone counting on me hope my numbers don’t fall short
I’m still battling snakes coming at me in all sorts
Trying not to get bit, I gotta win like all sports
Still trying to sail this ship when they closed off all ports

[Verse 2]
Yeah I see it
But they gonna have to see me too
Kinda hard to vision a dream when you're stuck in a nightmare
Everything point against your love don't fight fair
Enemies playing angels only hoping your life spare
Sick of walking these shoes I'm trying to find me the right pair
Streets yelling out king I guess I'm still in the right chair
Trying to delete my circle before it's got by the right square
Been chosen their bed though it gave me a light scare
Feel like everyone watching even if it's a light stare
Looking at everyone who said fuck me I gotta fade 'em
And what they know don't apply, if I trip out can't no one save 'em
I know I'm in God's favor, therefore I can never hate 'em
Just sit you up with the business and shake em up 'til I wake 'em
Don't wait on me, my ride is in motion
Trying to make it when my kids turned 17 it was toasting
Seen too many take advance so I just focus on coasting
I've acquire to be greater so this show I was hosting, G

[Verse 3]
This is the trip ain’t
It it's all good nigga
I'm still at it nigga
Yeah I'm on it
My inner spirit keep telling me Trae you not a loser
Go lose them niggas in traffic and get them for what they do's ya
Nigga was getting older walking talking and laughing
And talking shit at the same time funny how time is passing
Lil Jared is fly as a Hulk
I know them girls gonna be in trouble you can tell when he talk
It ain't a game, baby houston is a star I can feel it
Give them a year, I swear he gonna be hot as a skillet
I know my life ain't been the best but I could say I'm alive
I'm thanking god that I ain't die I'm out here trying to survive
A lot of people seen me hurting so they turned away
Went about their business
I came in this alone so I'm gonna be there when I finish
I prayed to get out the hood
This lil nigga that could
I say it ain't all bad I'm just trying to make it for good
Mama told me to win I'ma do my best just so I can make her proud
Before either one of us make it to a cloud

[Outro]
And I'ma do that
Forreal
Bet your life on that one
Come on
I got it
Tell them niggas watch me
Yeah tell them niggas watch me
Yeah, tell them niggas watch me
I tried to tell em watch
