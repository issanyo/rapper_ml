Here is what all happened at the southside house
Meet DJ screen the man who has created a new sound
When I first started I thought it would all be alright but
My people started to listen to it and feel it, it really jumped off
And I know it's going to be lit

New clips on rap music that is taking him from the underground
To the mainstream, he’s slowing down rap music, making him
Other rap clips and he’s dancing as they go around

Fighters and DJ scroll found into a national phenomimom because
Right now it’s his own style and it’s new to we down on the west coast
The east coast and the midwest and finally hearing about it

He’s already signed to a record label and his second CD sold over
One hundred thousand copies, His current CD debut at number 57 on the chart
Even though he had no business
Trae Tha record continued where he sold his
Rap creation
So we seeing a blessing that somebody really likes our music
Cause now it’s ready to get realer play it and quit saying something that I did
