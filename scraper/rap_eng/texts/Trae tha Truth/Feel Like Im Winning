[Hook - Trae The Truth,DeLorean]
I feel like im winning
Pedal to the floor on a mission with a vision never thought i seen before
Ok it feel like im winning started independent interstate pushing now them niggas finally talking business
But shit I feel like im winning i ain't come to lose if its me against the world fuck it i lace up my shoes
Ok it feel like im winning can't afford a L I'mma bail can't you tell how a young nigga did it
I feel like im winning!

[Verse 1 - Trae The Truth]
Im from the city with a clear view
In this mercedes kicked back
Last night i dreamed of no stress
Look bitch im tryna get back
I ain't come to here to lose so tell them L's to move the fuck on
DeLo said fuck the struggle thats the same shit i been stuck on
22 inch guerillas extended i sit my truck on
When i see these hoes i take aim fuck em and get the fuck on
You think charlie was winning
Look at these diamonds im grinning
Or look at this paint im cruising weather that shit you swim in
Homies said i deserve it from all the shit i been in
Any given you taking from me? guerrillas get sent in
I want everything in front of me being last
Im the teacher pay attention this class
Nigga!

[Verse 2 - DeLorean]
Burgundy top
I murder the lot
Top yellow tape on da slab
Smell like an eight and a half
Still riding dirty she taking bath
And if you said this last year you'd be making em laugh
That im winnning im winning im winning im winning you losing
You try to come between my hustle its not only just music
Gotta vision for the team
Its not an illusion
And the world is just a bitch and forever she choosing
She probably pick you tomorrow
Got some bitches and bottles
All my bitches is dollars
All my pictures is polished
Come and get a glimpse of a winner
I be damned if i let them stop dinner
