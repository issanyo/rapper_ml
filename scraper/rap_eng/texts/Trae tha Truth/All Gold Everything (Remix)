[Intro: Trae Tha Truth]
You rockin with one of the realest right now
Trae Tha motherfuckin Truth
A.B.N, Hustle Gang nigga

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Young Truth James, all gold solja
Black ice, you ain’t seen shit colder
Young Truth James all gold soldier
Black ice you ain’t seen shit colder
All through a price, nigga, everything gold
I’m the man ask about me, nigga, everybody know
All gold coup, gold chains on me
In the hood stunting with this change all on me
Nigga, feel like snow blow game like Sony
Don shot a bitch, leave her brains all on me
Louie got these racks on hostage trying to get out
Ceiling on my whip too cocky I made em sit out!
You can find me in the hood like I never been out
Johnny got a spot for a nigga, I’m bout to rent out
Diamonds in my grill, I got that work off in the locker
Fly across a hater with that all gold chopper
Haters on my dick I’d rather try to bumper
Green lighter light up like can’t stop ya
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga

[Verse 2: Yung Quis]
Gold all in my watch, niggas be hatin so I ride with that Glock
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga
Wutchu sayin? I’m so hot
Fresh out of Charlie I just sold the block
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga
She pop the molly, she sweatin too
20 floors up, I got a great view, no Kevin Durant but my niggas shoot
One gold watch, it don’t look gold
That bitch iced out, that bitch look froze
Tippin on 6-10, black paint, black floors
Boss ain’t get em I’mma get em all trust me
Trace ain’t get em I’mma let the russle
Open the brick now I’m grinding
Open the brick now I’m grinding
For the hoes add dreams
Feed live, fetish too
Smoking mean, not keys
Kush bar for life and my niggas too
These niggas, they know
I saw that shit with my eyes closed
Strap up when I’m fuckin these hoes
I’m a boss so I might buy heels and clothes
Keys!

[Hook: Trinidad James]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Cribs all in my chain
Cars all in my ring
All them bad bitches watchin’
Nigga, nigga, is it me or my watch?
Man, I pull up in the bank, 2-litre full of drank
Shaquille up in the paint, a dealer on my link
I popped the molly, can’t sleep
I popped the molly, can’t eat
Bad batch – my nigga
Don’t pass that shit to me
I’m high – my nigga
Stop talkin’ that shit to me
I be gettin’ to the money, give a fuck about a hater
I be rollin’ up the OG in paper like the Taylor gang
Getting’ money my nigga
Fuck them niggas that’s hatin’
It’s Montana, my nigga
We don’t count money, we weigh it

[Hook: Trinidad James]
Gold all in my watch

Nigga nigga nigga

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Big bank, all I do is get bank
Niggas hating on me but they bitch ain’t
So conceited, I don’t think my shit stank
400,000 dollars on a Mulsanne
Come and kick it with a west side nigga
Ain’t about that action, wanna bet my nigga?
All day thumbing through the check my nigga
Boy you’re broke, you can’t even be a threat my nigga
When you’re talking to me say it with your chest little nigga
I pull up on your set and make a mess little nigga
Okay, I got a kilo of gold 36 O’s
Wrapped around the neck of a dope boy
Gold yacht, that’s the presi’ diamond in those
And just paid cash for a Rolls Royce
A true trap nigga, I done sold everything
Trouble man, hustle gang, all gold everything
I said trouble man, hustle gang, all gold everything

[Verse 5: Young Jeezy]
Bought a gold bottle now we on the Dom
Big faced Rollie take up half my arm
Porsche 911 with the Gabby top
All gold scale, that’s my magic box
Got the soft, my nigga
Give me thirty minutes, I’ll be right witcha
Got the hard, my nigga
Let me whip this here I’ll get it right to ya
Goddamn, I’m turnt up
I think the knob just broke and I don’t give a fuck
Goddamn, I’m fucked up
The streets dry as hell, this work high as fuck
She want white, boy, dudes take it easy man
Shit I’d pay less for a pair of Yeezy’s man
All I wanna know if I’mma bounce with her
Talking me to death like I’m a counselor
She popped a Molly I’m guessing
But if she throwing the pussy I’m catching
223 with a silencer
Gon’ rock that shit with the flyest fur
All gold like Montana (Tony)
Hoes all in my phantom (Rollies)
Young done killed the gold remix
A nigga don’t like it, God damn him

[Hook: Trinidad James]
Gold all in my chain, gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Nigga nigga nigga

Gold all in my chain, gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch, don’t believe me just watch

[Verse 6: 2 Chainz]
Even all of my hat, snakeskin all in my hat
Hit your girl with my chains on so that’s gold all on her back
Gold all on my watch, so big it’s like a clock
Some people wear fox fur, on the Source cover I wore a fox
This for all the DJ’s that got this on replay
I sell a brick on eBay, then I celebrate
Several bitches in every state
I’m in Miami with Wayne trying to skate, my family straight
Ayo, ho ’bout to hyperventilate, I owe her one, we did a 68
I say hoes, my nigga, them ain’t red bottoms, her bottom brown
I’m smoking strong, my nigga, I’m on loud, not Bobby Brown
That’s souf side up in here, I spell “souf” with a F
F stand for fuck y’all if you ain’t fucking with my set
Fuck with me and I’m busting, fuck with me and I’m busting
Every time you see me think about what it would be like if I ain’t do nothing
Damn right, I’m stunting, damn right, I’m styling
Just got a girl chauffeur and we on a motorcycle and she driving
This Versace, that Versace, this Versace, too
I got killers watching, niggas watching, bitches watching me too
See I’m on lean, on loud, and I got my own lane
You need to mind your own business, it’s 2 Chainz and Trinidad (James)

[Hook: Trinidad James]
Gold all in my chain, gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Nigga nigga nigga

Gold all in my chain, gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch, don’t believe me just watch

[Verse 7: Tyga]
T-Raww I don’t fuck with niggas
My money long my temper midget
King gold chains I reinvented
This gold shit, you a gold fish nigga
Try me 4 kings like free sale nigga
Sippin’ out a cup like a toddler nigga nigga
Who the fuck want drama pain
Back got it like a chiropractor mane
Got that nigga rock quarter mill and chain
Got score at your lights stakes a lane
Nigga nigga sunroof your brain
Claim that you drink but you can’t even hang
Only came cause a nigga got paid
Sleep with them hoes, they gon fuck up your name, name
Pop the zanny I’m stressin, woo, pop the molly I’m flexin, woo
Dre Beats my beats bang, biker jeans ball me
She suck me off till I’m all drained
Kick her out Lu Kang, (bitch)
Wide body need two lanes, got a five oh four bitch go to Tulane
Niggas think that I’m playing I ain’t saying it just to be saying it and nigga make your bed laying in..
Born sinner, make a nigga die for his dinner
Eyes of a tiger stone killer cold blooded when I (bah)
Fucking beast, goin’ ham gotta eat
Thanksgivin don’t thank me, cause that ain’t beef
Yall niggas sweet, money leech, money laundering
Private jet I don’t fly economy
Man I’ll make it rain while you niggas tryin maintain
All my niggas gang bang, shout out Honey Cocaine
Last Kings, YMCMB bitch
One eighty seven stay on some G shit
