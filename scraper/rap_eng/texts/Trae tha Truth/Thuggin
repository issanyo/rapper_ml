[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah
I got twenty thousand diamonds on, know what I'm sayin'
I'ma head trade these, know what I'm sayin'
Uh, huh, huh

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Get my jewels up
Live like Jesus
Ice on me like
I got a fever
We trained to take from 'em
'Cause they wouldn't feed us
Now I got M&M's
'Round my visa
Feed the bitch pizza
Mauri gator got measles
Ready like werewolf
I can be a soo woo creature
I don't do phones, got beepers
I don't ride in cars, can't bleep us
New tattoo say, "Free Meech"
Show me how to treat this cougar

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
Kilo my tailor, I'm lookin' like a trap
I get this money, run it like a lap
Blow through one-fifty, that's without the cap
And broke my attention, that'll get you slapped
Everything go so guess I'm tryna surf
Got your bitch watchin', guessin' what I'm worth
Know if she hop in here she getting work
I tell her go'n and take it like a perc
Asshole, I don't go
Dip my chain in this snow
Bet my name you don't know
Aim and shoot 'til I score
Have the whole hood on go
Everything Big like Mo
H-Town, everything slow
I don't make shit I can't blow
Somethin' exotic I got from Dubai
Whip Panameric to vision the sky
They say I'm not 'bout it, I tell 'em to try
But tha Truth get it poppin' like fourth of July
Fuck is you watchin', I'm fire like flames
Can't picture me, bitch I'm out of your frame
King of the streets, you can't quiet the name
Nigga pull up on me, I hop out, let it rain

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Get my jewels up
Live like Jesus
Ice on me like
I got a fever
We trained to take from 'em
'Cause they wouldn't feed us
Now I got M&M's
'Round my visa
Feed the bitch pizza
Mauri gator got measles
Ready like werewolf
I can be a soo woo creature
I don't do phones, got beepers
I don't ride in cars, can't bleep us
New tattoo say, "Free Meech"
Show me how to treat this cougar

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Balmain, Jimmy Choo shoes
Come here and pay my dues
Never send the bitch no nudes
Shawty wanna fuck my dude (Can't fuck my dude)
I went broke, can't lose
I pay the Jag, no news
Paid a couple bands for her boobs
Five thousand chains for the crew
I'm out the coupe
I'm 'bout to shoot
Wanna see a rich nigga from the gutter
I'm the proof (I am facts)
I cut my bread up with no butter, who are you?
I'm YSL, I'm filthy rich and so are you
I'll never cross my guys, no no
I'll never cross my guys, ayy (never, never, yeah)
I'm tellin' the truth, ain't nothin' disguised
Five thousand dollars, I'ma go'n Xzibit my ride, ayy

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Get my jewels up
Live like Jesus
Ice on me like
I got a fever
We trained to take from 'em
'Cause they wouldn't feed us
Now I got M&M's
'Round my visa
Feed the bitch pizza
Mauri gator got measles
Ready like werewolf
I can be a soo woo creature
I don't do phones, got beepers
I don't ride in cars, can't bleep us
New tattoo say, "Free Meech"
Show me how to treat this cougar

[Verse 3: Trae tha Truth]
I ball out the gym, ain't no doubt I'ma flex
What's on my neck cost a hell of a check
Diamonds like water, shit guess I was wet
Blow through this money, no worries, I'm set
No point in United, I just bought the jet
Still keep a tool on me, guess I'm a threat
Bitch ain't 'bout money, she sit like a pit
Nothin' personal, I'm just out here to finesse

[Verse 4: Skippa Da Flippa]
I used to jugg in the trap
Too many sacks, you think I'm Warren Sapp
I used to hit licks and bust down the cap
Now I get backends all over the map
I beg your pardon, no I'm not sorry
Twin turbo Flippa just copped a 'Rari
I charge a ten to see me party
My white boys on Harleys and they go gnarly
Ice ice ice baby
Ice ice for my lady
Nothin' but blue hundreds lately
He said he havin', I told him to save it
Bricks in the basement, just bought a Mercedes
VS stones, no inside
In the lab like I'm Bill Nye
New Bentley with the frog eyes
I been chasin' after dead guys

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Get my jewels up
Live like Jesus
Ice on me like
I got a fever
We trained to take from 'em
'Cause they wouldn't feed us
Now I got M&M's
'Round my visa
Feed the bitch pizza
Mauri gator got measles
Ready like werewolf
I can be a soowoo creature
I don't do phones, got beepers
I don't ride in cars, can't bleep us
New tattoo say, "Free Meech"
Show me how to treat this cougar
