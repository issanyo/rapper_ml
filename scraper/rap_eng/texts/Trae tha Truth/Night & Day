[Verse 4 - Trae Tha Truth]
King of the late night, everything ’bout me trill
Baby I’m from Texas, gripping this wood wheel
You looking like you lost, let me navigate up inside ya
Face in the pillow, I’m tryna hide ya on some other shit
Somewhere on the sideline watching, that’s where the mother sit
All between your legs, face diving, that’s where the mother spit
How these niggas tryna recruit ya? Their game is way off
You first drink on the team that’s in the playoffs, chyea
[Chorus - Lloyd]
I told her I can show you how I feel about you night and day
That’s how I feel about you, oh yeahhh
And you can call me up, and I’ll come runnin’ to you right away
That’s how I feel about you, that’s how I feel
