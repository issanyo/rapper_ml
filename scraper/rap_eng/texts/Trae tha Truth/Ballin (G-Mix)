[Hook: Young Jeezy (x2)]
You think you ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
King of the streets, bitch cause I'm in that [?]
Julius Erving in the hood ask'em what they talking
If they don't tell ya I'm realest then them bitches hatin'
Trunk full of some call it [?] wonderland
Find me somewhere off in the traffic with this gun in hand
I'm tryna score like I was Kobe and Jason Terry
Hit the block and get a triple double of this Katy Perry
I'm going in tell I'm going not at all
Diamonds on my head stupid they ain't got it all
And if they did have it, I don't think they gave a fuck
Something like this F&NI'm holding nigga try your luck

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Hopped up out the bed, I think my roof gone
Think I forgot to put my roof on
Said “fuck it, buy another car”
Hopped out the Lamb’
Said “fuck it, bought another car”
I bought the Phantom just to say it’s black
I bought the Phantom just to take a nap
I’m getting head in the backseat
I might stop and stand it tall like a athlete
I’m ballin’ hard, I need a jersey on
So much bread on me, I can buy a Jersey home
I’m on them Diddy’s, spendin’ Dirty Money
I’m on that Jizzle, spendin’ birdy money

[Hook: Young Jeezy]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
These hoes call me Tunechi baby
Niggas think they seeing me, they hallucinating
Bitch, I’m balling, ballin’ like a motherfucker
12 gauge, bitch, I got a dozen of them
Nigga broke, acting like he got it though
I’m with a Spanish bitch, if she ain't fucking, adios!
So many cars I’m like eenie meenie minie moe
So many colours in the diamonds, Kaleidoscope
Last year I made a hundred million dollars flat
Run in ya house, get to poppin’ at your shower cap
My homies got them firebirds like Pontiac
And if them bitches don’t sell, we buy em back
Where the strippers, tell em Tune on his way
Tell them niggas I’m strapped like lingerie
I ain't trippin, I’m ballin, call me NBA
I-I ain't trippin, I’m ballin, call me NBA
