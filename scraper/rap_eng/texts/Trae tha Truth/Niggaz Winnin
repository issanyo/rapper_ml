Stars intertwine

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Yeah I'm on in this bitch who hating cause they can't get on
I'm looking for the same run Jay Z and Dame went on
Baby and Wayne still on
I'm talking about them independent Benjamins mayne, same thing that the Bay been on
I dream big eyes wide open I call it sleep walking
No ear to the ground but I can hear the streets talking
About the boy who put beats In the deep coffin
You niggas running four three and I'm in the lead jogging
Tinted windows, I sit in a rented limo
With a video fix and pen and pencil and an instrumental
Sets his business over bitches I scribble sick lyrics
Then I stick my dick in the bitches dental
Not coincidental, it's pimpin' my nigga
Look what I get her to do
Her and her pretty friend Jennifer too
69ning so it's dinner for two
Raise my arm, the winner is who
LBC I did it for you

[Verse 2: Trae]
For my city I'm in position used to Texas as I'm blissing
Still the truth, the voice no absent for second guessing
Be a victim of obedience slap it as soon as you guessing it
I'm what you consider real so don't question it
So many days I remember being in the front line but right now I'm in front of that
You can pick your biz I skip this answer jump in front of that
Tellin' I'm an asshole, problems you don't want none of that
I desintegrate 'em that's with the bitches won't coming back
Competition is in the smoke they come losing and smoking dope
Speaking of smoke and toss smoking something you can't smoke it and blow
To music I'm lyrically like a ghost tryin' to hide in these beats
Swear I was Michael Phelps so I dive these freaks
I never take some holy thing all I'm chasing is a budget
Face the sundee, as I make no brand in this breathe
Pussy niggers they nothing they know that fuck shit is dead
They don't want to see us for real them niggers scared

[Hook: Crooked I]
From down South to the East coast
My niggas winning
I got my grind on beast mode
My niggas winning
Some blue doc and some weed smoke
My niggas winning
We still live by the G code
Niggas winning

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
My jean size 38 in the waist
I ain't talking levi's 38 in the waist
I got my city behind me
Just like I'm Trae in the H
I look at you like section 8
Ain't no cost you shit
To stay in your place
I'm going Tim Duncan in this tape drop
That mean I'm 'bout to ball on your squares like it's bank shot
Satan in a tank top, fire all for niggers
Who think they gonna take what? Take shots
This rounds on me
I'mma touch your body away
I guess the ground gonna see
Learn it click burn it some down OG's
Then I learned avoiding beefs, when I found more G's
That knowledge gets me knowledge, them bitches be down on knees
I tell 'em
Giving you pussy to lose this it's not poppin'
Bitches stacks dropping for not watching they twat options
She fucking around with them but then
She only let the dick of a winner in her-in her

[Hook: Crooked I]
From down South to the East coast
My niggas winning
I got my grind on beast mode
My niggas winning
Some blue doc and some weed smoke
My niggas winning
We still live by the G code
Niggas winning
My niggas winning
My niggas winning
Niggas winning
My niggas winning

[Outro: Melody Angel]
Stars intertwine
I don't wanna miss my ride
When the planets align
They let me lose my time
But you're afraid of heights
I was born to fly
What comes next
