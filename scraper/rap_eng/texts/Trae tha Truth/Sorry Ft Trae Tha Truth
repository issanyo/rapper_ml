[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]


You looking for Mr perfect
Guess he ain't found here
Where I'm from it ain't much of that
Found around here
I took a couple of chances
I never found fear
You say you sick and you tired
I hear that sound clear
And yeah, I might have messed up
I'll forget it if you let me
Somehow I guess you forgot
You was flaggin' down the chevy
And every night after that
You was ridin' nothin steady
Night after night i was planning
Tryna' lift you like a levy
Am I wrong? maybe so
Too late say I ain't worth it
You tried to leave before
I guess you say I deserved it
Every road rough
Too late for you trying to curb it
They say revenge is cold
Look at you trying to serve it
That's a trip now
Why you want to flip now?
Pack your stuff and dip now?
Out of town and skip now?
Hop off in your whip now?
Claiming you ain't falling for me
Ain't no point to slip now

[Verse 2: Wednzday]

Ain't that how it
Ain't that how it
Ain't that how shit go
The minute you say you love me
I can't take this shit no more

Ain't that how it
Ain't that how it
Ain't that how shit be
The minute you say you're gonna change
I'd rather see you leave oh'

[B Section: Wednzday]

So cry me a river
Its nothing compared
To the oceans that I cried for you
Took too much time
For you to realize
All of the thing that I do

You made your bed
So you gon' have to lay in it
So lay in it

[Chorus: Wednzday ]

I don't want to hear I'm sorry
I don't want to hear I'm sorry
[I dont want hear Im..]

[Verse 3: Wednzday]

Damn it's crazy
Damn it's crazy
Crazy how shit be
When I'm on you, you resistant
I fall back, you all on me

Why it's gotta'
Why it's gotta
Why it's gotta be this way?
Why do nigga's want to act right
When we take our love away?

[B Section: Wednzday]

So cry me a river
Its nothing compared
To the oceans that I cried for you
Took too much time
For you to realize
All of the thing that I do

[Chorus 2: Wednzday]

I don't want to hear I'm sorry
I don't want to hear I'm sorry
[I dont want hear Im..]

[Bridge: Wednzday]
I never
I never
I never thought it'd get this far

I never
I never
I never thought you'd break my hear

[Chorus 3: Wednzday]

I don't want to hear I'm sorry
I don't want to hear I'm sorry
[I dont want hear Im..]

I don't want to hear I'm sorry
I don't want to hear I'm sorry
[I dont want hear Im..]
