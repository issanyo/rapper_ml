[Intro ]
Yo
Hey daddy
Wassup Juice
What you over there doing
Chill in the studio
They told me I got 48hrs to do this freestyle tape
I got it though, is it good, is it good?
It is me haha, it ain't better than me
Ain’t this some shit

[Verse 1]
I’m a scrape plate tapper
New to a rapper, now that I cap her
Big paper stacker, money I was after
Froze to adapter, foods time diner
Waiting on the jagger everything is so slow
Moving all of my dews, player so I get choose
We ain’t loving no hoes hustling full time
Slow time down, these ain’t no fools
Swinging like I’m going craz
RIP to fair play got myself on my ass
These escape no fools
Swinging like i’m going craz
RIP to fair play
RIP to fair play

It’s about the end of the day
Tell em hate niggas

Get it nigga I’m trying to weighten the pay
All e it doesn't matter your set of greeve
Ball hard nigga I’m in the game for mine
Fuck niggas ain’t shit they just waste your time
Nigga I don’t give a damn I spray for mine
Even the niggas you love will take you down, no shit
Hey b whats poppin nigga
Bing says blaze it up nigga
All gas no breaking up nigga, not me
These streets will lock you up nigga
Oh I was ruling ruling gather rules
Dropping that got me through
Witsy Bitsy baby not to go hit the switch
I’m trying to hop the low
Keep the heat them ice got me cold
Money hit me got me looking swarve
Keep that g the day have ever been told
I was thought to ride and never fold
Nigga this word to mamma
I was in a field trying to get these commas
Cooler nigga but i’m about that drummer
Fold ass niggas ain’t about those unders
