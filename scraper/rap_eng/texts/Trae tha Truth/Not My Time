[Intro: Trae]

Let me talk to them
You need to pay attention to the truth
You know it's here
For every death, brings new life
And with new life
Our chances are limited
They say it's limited by the experiences
That we may come across on a day to day basis
It's limited by the circumstances, of us being less fortunate in life
They say it's limited by the spirit and hope we have
That everybody try to take from you
But then it's unlimited when you find peace with god

[Verse 1: Trae]

Come take a walk through the hood with me
Where faith is at a lower level cuz pressure is hard
30 years in a cell will leave a killer acquainted with God
Going to war with pain will leave you internally scarred
Watchin' the world crash is kinda odd
We in the last days is what they tellin' me
8 year old children bein' convicted of a felony
Never had a life stereotype is what they bred to be
Momma dead, daddy prolly somethin' they will never see
The economy under fire by President Bush
That's why they hood spend most of their days
Blowin' president kush, the way he got us daily
Give us a reason to push unless he on the verge of suicide
And we gave 'em a push
Katrina came and left our neighbors wit' some deadly weather
And off the rip I beg the lord to try to make it better
I feel they pain so now I ride wit' them like it's whatever
Yeah I represent for New Orleans and Texas together
I got a kite the other day from my homie's on lock
They beg me not to switch up like rest. Look here
Homie I'm not (You know I got you)
So every chance I get to roll I'm coming the block (I'm coming the block)
I'm in these penientary walls, till they tell me to stop
I witness murder by the minute on another skill
Sirens and a couple shots mean another body still (Body still)
Even if we see it rules, got us unable to tell
My Heart goes out to all those victims who done been thru hell
Children molested by these cowards who ain't in at all
As long as I'm living, I ain't gon' let these cowards win at all (Ain't gon' let them win)
And for my people I'mma stand up till a soldier fall
I'm so serious, ain't no need for me to grin at all
And on another note, my girl homie momma is a smoker
I promise I wanna help but she duck off when I approach her
I'm so sensitive to the pain that I'm numb
Put the world against me, on my babies I ain't finna run (I ain't finna run)
And speakin' of babies, I'm seein' babies havin' babies
Ho ass niggas skeetin' in these kids like they grown ladies (They goin' to hell)
They tell me life gon' get better if Obama win (If Obama win)
I agree as long as he don't switch up in the end (Switch up in the end)
My brother been in the pen a little over ten
I gotta send him pictures just to help 'em live again
I let 'em know there's no limit how far this end extend
If I gotta die to see 'em free, then I'll be checkin' in
That's on my spirit homie...

[Verse 2: Lynzie Kent]
The vultures are coming
Their hunting for your blood
Their circling the streets
But don't give them what they want
But don't give them what they want
And I know you got a secret
And it's causing you pain
So lay low baby
It won't hurt you again
It won't hurt you again
It won't hurt you again
It won't hurt you again
I look through these eyes
And these eyes only
I live through this life
Sometimes it's lonely
I look through these eyes
And these eyes only
I Live through this life
Sometimes it's lonely
Sometimes it's lonely
My life...
My life...
