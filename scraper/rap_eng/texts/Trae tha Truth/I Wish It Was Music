[Hook 1: Wyclef]
Whoa, wish this was a Metallica concert
I wish that it was music when they walk in the building
Someone ring the alarm, we sound like rock and roll
We sound like rock and roll
Whoa, wish this was man a rolling stone concert
I wish that it was music when they walk in the building
Someone ring the alarm, we sound like rock and roll
We sound like rock and roll

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Problem officer? What were you looking for
Man I ain't done shit, what the fuck you looking for?
Guess it cause I rap, what has a rapper done to you, I ask?
Smoke some weed, show his ass when he sag
Man everybody that look like me
Ain't the one you should harass and ask for id
You would never see Trayvon Martin in a hoodie in Connecticut
Shooting the kindergarten
Is it me, or can anyone see, our only history
While the massacre was linked to you
The prison sentence was linked to me
Second amendment was stripped from me
All because you scared of what
I go and see an urban movie, shoot the movie theater up
Man that fucked up, cause I’m a good dude
And when I had tools, I knew when to use em
Usually the likes of you sit high and glow in the likes of me
My music ain't the problem shawty, not as far as I can see

[Hook 2: Wyclef]
Whoa, wish this was man a summer jam concert
I wish that it was music when they walk in the building
Someone ring the alarm, we sound like rock and roll
We sound like rock and roll
Whoa, wish this was a Coachella concert
I wish that it was music when they walk in the building
Someone ring the alarm, we sound like rock and roll
We sound like rock and roll

[Verse 2: Trae the Truth]
Look, shit real, but I’m riding
Too late for slowing this pace down
Lately life has been so cold
Gotta keep that '5 on my waist line
Even though I don’t want to, I got to
Look at what they did to the babies
I couldn't imagine that feeling
The way feeling with something so crazy
That’s that shit that make you sick
Lose all hope and make you quit
Trying to piece this puzzle but shit don’t fit
So many things I just don’t get
They say in life it ain't nothing that’s promise
We in the living hell, I just had to be honest
The pain sounding like metal, the color of Ebonics
When it play, everything in the path of it demolish
Everyday the same stage, but a different show
It’s hard to focus everyday but on a different row, damn

[Hook 3: Wyclef]
Whoa, wish this was man a bonoroo concert
I wish that it was music when they walk in the building
Someone ring the alarm, we sound like rock and roll
We sound like rock and roll
Whoa, wish this was a Metallica concert
I wish that it was music when they walk in the building
Someone ring the alarm, we sound like rock and roll
We sound like rock and roll

[Verse 4: Wyclef]
Last days, revelations front page, 666 out in Boston
Its the Beasts rage
I send a message to the pagans with the ravens
The numbers to decode, the secrets locked up in the Vatican
I guess that's why my papa named me Wyclef Jean
I was named after the reformer tato that was protestant
And ever since then, daddy built churches in the hood
But it’s hard to see my cousins in a box made out of wood
Statistically they said that I’d be dead by 23
I guess they didn't read the good book and see the prophecy
The youngings said it’s too deep, I’m trying to move these rocks
X ray came back on his mom’s breasts, they found lumps
But he gotta hustle, his mama only man
He got 3 sisters, papa in the can
Desperate times, desperate measures
He pulled a 2 shooter, tell the clerk I want everything in the register

[Hook 5: Wyclef]
Whoa, wish this was at a Timbaland concert
I wish that it was music when they walk in the building
Someone ring the alarm, we sound like rock and roll
We sound like rock and roll
Whoa, wish this was a Metallica concert
I wish that it was music when they walk in the building
Someone ring the alarm, we sound like rock and roll
We sound like rock and roll
