[Intro: Future]
Oh, you know you ain't got all them guns
And you ain't killed nobody yet
How many times you shot that muhfucka?
Ain't nobody popped up dead
Shit!

[Hook: Future]
Talking 'bout you popping tags, nigga you ain't bought shit
Talking bout a hunned bottles, nigga you ain't popped shit
All you talk nana clips, nigga you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga you ain't fuck shit

[Verse 1: Trae]
?

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Thirty in the clip catch the whole thing
Feds know a nigga by his whole name
Shoot him in his head for his gold chain
You was running ball, we was sellin' cocaine
Talkin bout you buyin' bricks, nigga you ain't got shit
We was sellin' all them keys, we was like the locksmith
Twenty-Five hundred for the red bottoms
Balmain five bands for the waist nigga
I'm rollin' through my city in a new Rolls Royce
Cheif Keef 300 for the Wraith nigga
A.K, S.K, H.K nigga, three K's like I hate niggas
And I'll put you in your place nigga
You got shoebox money I got a safe nigga holdup

[Hook: Future]
Talking 'bout you popping tags, nigga you ain't bought shit
Talking bout a hunned bottles, nigga you ain't popped shit
All you talk nana clips, nigga you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga you ain't fuck shit

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
Made the Forbes and I'm straight up outta projects
Still running with them niggas with that work check
It go "Brrrrrrrr" with the choppa
That's the only way the pussy 'posed to stop ya
Pour out a little liquor, one in every got a ghetto
Stack a 20 bill, nigga, tall as Carmelo
Winter olympic games and the categories caine
Bet ya one fuckin' thing, I'll win a gold medal
Why ya actin' like a bitch? Lil Jon, my nigga
Don't you ever doubt me, I'm like LeBron, my nigga
I ain't takin' no shorts, bitch, I hit it with the fork
Fuck a wrist game, use my whole arm, my nigga
Snowman, bitch, y'all know me
Fourth quarter pressure on 'em like Kobe
Act like my shit don't stink, pocket feel like a bank
Neck lookin' like a 40 ounce of O.E
Tell me why my album selling, they ain't murder me yet
If they do, bury me in a burgundy 'Vette
Talk behind my back, you could hate me all ya want
But them same fuck niggas ain't shot shit yet
Yeah, you see me on Gangland, as real as it get
They just rappin' about it, I was livin' that shit
Straight up

[Hook: Future]
Talking 'bout you popping tags, nigga you ain't bought shit
Talking bout a hunned bottles, nigga you ain't popped shit
All you talk nana clips, nigga you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga you ain't fuck shit

[Bridge: T.I.]
This for my niggas when they walk up out the house, they (turn it)
Fuck what ya mouth say (turn it, turn it)

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Fully automatic rifle, 100 round drum on it with a scope
I done had that, nigga (Brrrrrrr, stick 'em)
I ain't playing with these niggas, just kill 'em, turn it
Nigga talk shit, I'll blast that nigga
Shoot his ass right in front his homeboys
Kill the party, drove off and then stab that nigga
Everyone vicinity hear the boy ho noise
I'm the Zone 1 king, from a whole one thing
Threw a 100 on it, shawty, I was doing my thing
You tryna get a million, I done did that
Aye, keep it pimpin', keep a ticket where I live at
Aye, listen, sucka, I got nothin' for ya but a new coffin
I'll shoot you walkin' 'fore you get through talkin', nigga!
Catch me walkin' in ya hood, trench coat swingin'
Mask on, step up on ya front porch bangin'
Them Bankhead niggas, they a muhfucka, ain't they?
I'm the realest, richest nigga that you know today famous
Catch ya flaggin' in ya hood and ya wanna be a gangsta
In ya skinny jeans in arenas entertainin'
No matter how you paint it, better see the big picture
I'll get ya, nigga, wit' ya, then hit ya nigga!

[Hook: Future]
Talking 'bout you popping tags, nigga you ain't bought shit
Talking bout a hunned bottles, nigga you ain't popped shit
All you talk nana clips, nigga you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga you ain't fuck shit
