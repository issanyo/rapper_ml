[Intro: Tito Lopez]
Uh, yea sir
I know I'm here, really number one
See I had to go
Take a journey into our lives man
It's what we do
What we did on a daily basis
Real niggas talkin
And I only hear it
Remember here to bust America
This is what we overcame, what we overcome baby
It's on the street, ain't gotta be seen

[Verse 1: Tito Lopez]
Growing up in the hood I
Always tried to be the good guy
On the prize kept a good eye
And I never had dreams but always thought I could fly
Puffin green for a good high
But you know they say the good die young
Pull the strap nigga would I run?
And I'm just waiting on the day that I can get my good car
And tell you hating niggas, goodbye
See, most niggas in the hood lie
On me, before I was low I was Tony
And I never had time for the jokes
Busy on the grind, trying to ride on the spokes
Folks don't chit, don't chatter
My OG told me that it don't matter
My nigga 6 pack on the yard
But I promise when he get back nigga turn up
Gonna run that shit back
It's my life dedication, grandmama always said be patient
Whether it's school or the streets
Nothing should keep you from getting yo education
Nowadays these rap niggas' a joke
Fill yo head with just liquor and smoke
Shit on the real low gotta get me some water
And fresh air 'for I choke
I am the one, begotten son
God put me on this earth for a reason
I ain't got no hit records
But you look in they eyes, I'm who they believe in
Ya'll don't believe em
Well be on yo way then
But me, I'm bout to put my foot on these niggas necks
Till they all gotta say when
Let the church say amen

[Hook]
And even though ya'll see diamonds and whips
We're just some boys in the hood that be out here grinding for chips
And even though ya'll see fortune and fame
We're just some regular niggas that deal with hurt through the pain, ah lawd
And even though ya'll see diamonds and whips
We're just some boys in the hood that be out here grinding for chips
And even though ya'll see fortune and fame
We're just some regular niggas that's part of the game

[Verse 2: Trae]
Two hands for the niggas in front of the trap
That the only shit i'd know if it wasn't for rap
Mama told me welcome [?], so i got me a strap
Then I plotted ahead with the help of a [?]
Been the king of the streets I'm still in
Pull up in the 4' when the window be real black
Hoes in love with me but I tell em' to kill that
Fool for the tool run up in em and drill that
Real ass niggas [?] now they real
Old school rock, never mind how they feel
Been front line ain't a day I play heel
Long live pimp, everyday I stay trill'
Ye ain't never heard about my team, tell em get ready
Money or whatever that's prolly why it's heavy
H-town nigga I test ride the chevy
I'm in love with it you'd think i was going steady
You believe that nigga you don't know me
Yo might look tough, but you ain't no G
I been the Truth, niggas try to be like me
One mil' plus niggas try to see it like me
Speaking of the [?] tell em look at this water
Watered than most competition get slaughtered
Hoe niggas hate, I don't much bother
Black print reader, nigga i'm the author
How the fuck you finna' taint what I designed?
How the fuck you gonna claim what I define?
I'm southwest nigga check the sign
2013, check the time
Other niggas crying like hoes, i'm grinding
While you out here looking for gold i'm diamond
Made it up out the dirt, I'm shinin
On the way, tell the niggas come find me

[Verse 3: Jaamel]
Had a dream last night that my life got better
Put my name on the contract and got a little cheddar
Then the haters started coming
Gave em 3 fingers told em read between the lines while I shine
Big Jaamel, yea but my friends call me Nico
Nigga you can stick with the government
Please get the fuck out my face acting like these hoes
Worried bout the niggas I fuck with
Back in the days I was throwed, ran around town chasing the hoes
Thinking that school's a joke
Now I'm here with the shotgun, setting in my pocket
Waiting for a play to unfold
Got a liquor bottle in my right hand bible in my left
I've done so much wrong I don't know what's next
I need a chevy with the butterfly doors
So I can fly away and purify my soul
Yall done fucked up, but that's ok
Cause i'm in here to do it my way
Just sprinkle a little bit of that powder
Then I got up on the track
And I pimpify five mics'
One for my lead vocals and my [?]vocal and my ad libs
And my shit talking and the last mic is for a hearse
Murder
Somebody put a bomb and flew it into this verse
Cause it's done with
I ain't got time for the dumb shit
Or a dumb bitch so don't question me about dumb shit
And don't be sweatin me for this dumb dick
If her name ain't Carmen, Adrea, Janice, Tito, Sin City, or Linus
And you can get the fuck on
And find another dick you can suck on
