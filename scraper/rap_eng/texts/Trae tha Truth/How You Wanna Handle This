[Hook]
How you wanna handle this? Man, we straight bust
About to let these fools know it ain’t no fucking with us
How you wanna handle this? High cappers get 30
Mess around and pull a move and get your fucking back dirty

[Verse 2: K-Rino]
I insert words to blood spurt, making your dome hurt
Weak rappers run up to K and get did like homework
Fools attracted to my verses be molesting my style
Fucking my flows they Beyoncé from Destiny’s Child
I got two more murders left, I plan to use fast
One for that rhyme you said, the other for your ass
Inject skill like drug overdoses when I diss ‘em
He ain’t smoke but they still found cocaine up in his system
I’m the last man standing when the right hand’s landing
To get to you I’ll steal a bike and bunny hop the Grand Canyon
I ain’t got to use my brain, you’ll still get swept up
I can outthink most of these rappers with my left nut
Wanna diss K-Rino, your rap career will be a short one
You using your third eye but I’m already on my forth one
The people be running to see me wreck a dumb trick
Like a fast nut when I start them bastards come quick

[Hook]
How you wanna handle this? Man, we straight bust
About to let these fools know it ain’t no fucking with us
How you wanna handle this? We’re damn sure represented
If you ain’t true to the game don’t even hop your ass up in it
