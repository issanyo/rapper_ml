Can't switch up Stayed down for myself
Imma have us when there's nobody else
Nigga throwing shots um um um um
Mad that im On em' at the top top top

1 TOK

Ain't no love in this shit
Had to stay down to come up in this shit
We all from the bottom no paper to gold
They say that rap over welp bitch I'm the goat
My niggas my niggas you niggas ain't wit us
Real from the fake we all know the difference
Can't fuck wit them niggas they ain't from the struggle
& i ain't goin back fuck the game wit a rubber
We was all hungry just grindin to eat
Ain't go to the army still all we could be
Just wanted money that's all we could see
Cut other hoes off cause them bitches was creeps
Dreaming to come up or come in my sleep
No matter how far same niggas wit me
Ain't none of you niggas familiar to me
Only the gang how it gotta be

Can't switch up Stayed down for myself
Imma have us when there's nobody else
Nigga throwing shots um um um um
Mad that im on em' at the top top top
Ain't nobody changing us
No you can not hang wit us
Don't know them niggas they ain't wit us
Ain't from where I'm from not the same as us

2 TIP

They is so lame stay in yo lane
Laughing with jet when yo video playing
Kicking shit whatever city I'm in
Boy I punish yo side hoe and slaying yo main
Minister pain get in her brain my
Word to her like what the minister saying

Touch you way in Japan just cause you
Arrogant mouth fucked up like only the can
Bet yo ego'll a be if I fought me amigo
I'm chasing that paper avoiding them kilos before a nigga ever did a
Deal I was 14 teen grippin steering wheel just ah
Trap nigga in ville wit ah road map to ah bunch of mills

3 Trae Tha Truth

Young truth from the bottom not king of the 6
Jungle was rough all I know is aggressive
Good wit these here but I'm strapped tech
Extended so I could teach em a lesson
By my lone so I can do it for my kids two
Sisters murdered brother doin bis (business)
I promised the clip I had to do it big
My status high them haters dismiss
Had to make it clear niggad couldn't get the picture
They used to laugh now I'm laughing at em cause I'm richer
Used to hit the turf booked up no scripture if
You was on the other side I couldn't fuck wit you
I do not debate they taught me not to hate
If they want truth I'm the perfect candidate
Was killing but the pain I animate foreign vehicle the top decapitate
