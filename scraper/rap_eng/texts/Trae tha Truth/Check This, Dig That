[Intro: T.I.]
Yeah, hey
Yeah, hey
Hey
I say now check this, dig that
Dig that

Hey

[Chorus: T.I.]
Check this, dig that
You know I be gettin' that money in them big stacks
You broke I can fix that, yeah
You broke I can fix that, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
I say now check this, dig that
You know I be gettin' that money in them big stacks
You broke I can fix that, yeah
Hey, come and see me, I can fix that, yeah
Hey, hey, gettin' money, nigga

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'm gettin' my hustle on and I'm rollin', got whatever gettin' that paper
Fresh out of prison, I'm glowin', middle finger raised to them haters
Get your chick before she gets stolen, one of my partner surely may take her
Send her back to you, pussy swollen, so it's messed up just like her make up
Got an elephant memory, it's flawless, I remember all of y'all who was talkin'
Got a good mind to run in your office, whoop your ass in front of your bosses
My partner died in my honor, I'm responsible for his mama
His daughter too, bet you she can go whatever college she wanna
Still wrap rubberbands in my bank roll, broke is somethin' I can't go
Bitches yellin' out I'm the shit, I'm like tell me somethin' I ain't know
My broker called said my stocks is up 20% so my profits increasin' even in my absence so my attitude is obnoxious
Contract almost expired, they get one more album off it
Better go tell Edgar Bronfman make my contract big as Bosh's
Got bitches on my side shit, and feds already watchin'
Just one more year of paper and I'm back to blowin' broccoli, ay!

[Chorus: T.I.]
Check this, dig that
You know I be gettin' that money in them big stacks
You broke I can fix that, yeah
You broke I can fix that, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
I say now check this, dig that
You know I be gettin' that money in them big stacks
You broke I can fix that, yeah
Hey, come and see me, I can fix that, yeah
Hey, hey, gettin' money, nigga

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I'm the king of Texas, I put on
On the block, tryna' put the whole hood on
Stay stiff, when them other niggas stood wrong
Street shit, only thing a nigga stood on
My niggas on Death Row, same shit like Suge
Attitude fucked, then shit been good
Tell 'em I got a million, ain't never gotta worry 'bout a thing
I represent it the best I could
Yeah, I get paid when I rap
Shit get flipped then I'm back to the trap
Trunk locked up with somethin' that clap
If you don't get that, then bitch'll get slapped
Bitch, I pop her, get this whopper, find me in the hood, same things I got shut up
I won't be stopped, probably why you niggas hate
Money gettin' big like look what I got up
You ain't seen that Maybach fella with that drop?
Chain stay icy, bitch, I stay hot
Yeah, I'm Truth, that's what you not
It's my time, fuck your plot
I got my team strong and my guns loaded
City mine, the whole hood voted
This murda bidness, they know I showed it
Suicide, both doors floated
Me and Tip, G-D-O-D, got that work, C-O-D
You've been livin' free, you got a P-F-E
That talkin' cool but ain't shit to me
Broke, I'll be damned if I go back
This Hustle Gang and you know that
We earned respect so you owe that
With the middle finger like hold that!

[Chorus: T.I.]
Check this, dig that
You know I be gettin' that money in them big stacks
You broke I can fix that, yeah
You broke I can fix that, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
I say now check this, dig that
You know I be gettin' that money in them big stacks
You broke I can fix that, yeah
Hey, come and see me, I can fix that, yeah
Hey, hey, gettin' money, nigga

[Verse 3: T.I.]
So many lanes with so much to say
But that's another topic for another day
They know face to face I clown nigga
Why you ain't talk shit now nigga?
Don't try to dap me up, you ain't down wit' us
Am I angry? Bitch, don't I sound bitter?
'Cause I'm so sincere
It's so severe that you know through all that I persevere
I die tomorrow, my hopes up there will be on some other level, my ghost'll fear
I got no compassion, no understandin' like y'all bitch asses, so underhanded
My rational is all reprimanded, just smash the gas, take full advantage
My patience short and my temper bad
So you'll find me everywhere you ain't at
The best you got, you better bring that
You wanna take me out? You can't fake me out
When they let me out, you wanna help me out
Nigga did these moves, come check me out
Me and Doug in the drop-top Bent' we are headed to the bank with a check we got
One thing, ain't no question 'bout it
If not more, I'm just as hot
Okay, scratch that, I'm spazzin' out
Big bank rolls I'm passin' out
I hug your hoe, she passin' out
Before she hit the ground, I'm mashin' out
I'm bossin' up and I'm stayin' down
Got racks on racks just layin' round
Big bank, nigga, ain't no playin' 'round
You wasn't checkin' me then, I bet ya did now

[Chorus: T.I.]
Hey, check this, dig that
You know I be gettin' that money in them big stacks
You broke I can fix that, yeah
You broke I can fix that, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
I say now check this, dig that
You know I be gettin' that money in them big stacks
You broke I can fix that, yeah
Hey, come and see me, I can fix that, yeah
Hey, hey, gettin' money, nigga
