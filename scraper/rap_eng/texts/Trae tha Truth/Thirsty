[Hook]
No can’t trust these hoes
You know they be lurking
They’ve been here since we hit the door
You know we been working
They know I put in work
Chicks thirsty
Chicks thirsty
Thirsty
Chicks thirsty
And been working
They know I see the thirst
I see you lurking
Chick lurking
Chick lurking
Chick lurking
Chick lurking
Chick lurking
They know I put in work

[Verse 1]
Yea I don’t trust hoes, bitches hot as the summer
Anytime time I walk into something they on my bumper
They can find me in the club suiting jumpers
Then I’m all time high I’m doing numbers
Hoes trying to fix my pipe like a mechanic
Told her she going to get no place you couldn't stand it
Standing got me somewhere mars I’m off planet
Jumping out the whip so hot you couldn't feel it
Bitches ain’t shit that’s your mammas
Money in the safe bank account all commas
Everything froze these diamonds Obama's
Keep hoes all on the chord no honor

[Hook]
No can’t trust these hoes
You know they be lurking
They’ve been here since we hit the door
You know we been working
They know I put in work
Chicks thirsty
Chicks thirsty
Thirsty
Chicks thirsty
And been working
They know I see the thirst
I see you lurking
Chick lurking
Chick lurking
Chick lurking
Chick lurking
Chick lurking
They know I put in work

[Verse 2]
Uh pull up stunt truck me in the front
A king I can do anything that I want
30 days on the road a million a month
Rolling up on the plane
Everywhere I go they know my name
You heard the song fuck her and sing
Tell them pass me the ball I better score
I’m all over the game
Your bitch mad you call her up her name
I pull my car up I don’t need no key
I just push a button and it start up
That’s tailored game no ordinary problems
I got rich ones
When it comes to those dollars I got big funds
I see they go stronger when it come on to the thirsties
I stay ducking and dodging

[Hook]
No can’t trust these hoes
You know they be lurking
They’ve been here since we hit the door
You know we been working
They know I put in work
Chicks thirsty
Chicks thirsty
Thirsty
Chicks thirsty
And been working
They know I see the thirst
I see you lurking
Chick lurking
Chick lurking
Chick lurking
Chick lurking
Chick lurking
They know I put in work
