[Verse:]

Hey my nigga trae truth
It's time to give the people the truth
Nobody’s speaking for the streets right now
I mean for the streets street
The struggle not so much because you in the streets
Killing and shooting and selling dope not that shit
We talking  about the struggle
Ain't no music out here for the struggle right now
That's what the people need
That's what i want you to get on this album nigga
We know we like to have a good time in the club
Everybody like to dance
But nigga when you're struggling you ain't trying
To mother fucking dance
Fuck amma dance for and i got to pay my Godam rent
Nigga i can't dance I’m struggling struggling
It's hard out here they just cut my grandmother heater bill off
You know how that heater bill be owed
Bitch can't even pay no heater bill no more
Nigga I’m calling my grandmother a bitch but
You know what i mean
Bitch owe me 20 dollars can't even pay me back
It's hard out here so that's what we need trae
We need some shit to speak for the people
Cause when i look on instagram I’m like
Everybody rich the fuck going on
But when i look outside it's like everybody is struggling
Struggling let's get back to that
Let's get back to some music that we
We can speak on what we see
That's around us not no fucking fairy tail
Give us the truth truth truth ahh am done
My life is amazing by the way
