(*talking*)
The root of all evil, is every man's downfall
Caught up in that street life, know I'm tal'n bout
I remember that G shit, had a nigga doing crazy ass shit
Can't forget that , I remember that shit like it was yesterday for real

[Trae]
Remember me, like I was FED time
The only thing that I knew, to live my life was doing crime
Even as a young nigga, all I ever wanted was to shine
The root of evil, kept gorillas living like we was blind
For the cash for the shine for the do', we was busting shots
And doing 85 in the hood, running from the cops
With Lil Shae and B.J., trying to bring the click to the top
And deep inside, I knew the streets would never let us out
I don't want no plex, but if you did then I would blast for mine
I don't want no cell, but if I get caught up I'm gon do my time
A real nigga forever for the good for the bad, never happy forever sad
Pee-Wee doing twenty agg'd, so I'm on my pen and my pad
Now look at everything that I've done, trying to live lavish
I'm sick of living life broke on the edge, and trying to manage
You got my brother in the Penn, for three with a L
You happy thinking it was love, but a nigga could never tell for the money

[Hook - 8x]
How could you, do this to me

[Dougie D]
This is the situation, and everything is looking so crazy
And I can't even take it, baby mama blame can't handle my baby
Tripping acting shady, when she the one that fucked up the family
But since the fact I'm a playa, Dougie slide right through the plexing
You know what it is, put this on everything I feel
Everything that I love, and everything that I live
Making my feddy want my money, and watching on whammies
Can't be tripping with the bullshit, because the bullshit is petty
I'm rocking this steady, and I deal what I do working jelly
Always on my P's and Q's, watching out for the federalies
Mash for my funds, Dougie D gotta try to get done
If it's hell or the highway fuck it, I'm cooking then bud
Constantly on my grind, busting my ass to feed my kid
Since them things, that I g ive my baby mama ain't like a bitch
It's enough I'm dealing with the laws, and it's enough I'm dealing with the niggas
Please don't create a mad man, fuck around and have all y'all singing

[Hook - 8x]

[Z-Ro]
I use to wonder how and why, my life was bad
Wanted to be anything, except like my dad
My apple fell far from the tree, straight out of the yard
Raising myself among strangers, living on boulevards
Gang related, nah just for fortune or fame
Because they know me by the Z-Ro, plus they know me by my first name
Picture me rolling, in my Dodge in traffic
I got no love for these niggas, so keep your groupie ass stepping
I can determine the real and the fake, don't make me ball up a pause
And punch a motherfucker's grill off his face
Case after case but it ain't slowing me down
See y'all ain't know me at first, I bet y'all knowing me now
So when my trigga fly a nigga die, I ain't playing no games
And fuck this North and South shit, cause I ain' t stating no claim
I ain't bring it with me, and I can't take it when I go
To the world, listen at what you did to me when I flow

[Hook - 16x]
