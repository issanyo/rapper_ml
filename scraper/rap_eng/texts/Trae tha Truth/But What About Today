[Hook] x3
But what about today

[Verse 1]
What about today i ain't worried about the next cuz it ain't here
Im gonna live my life for everything that it is and try not to shed no tears
Ain't no wishing upon a star cuz i can't see them from the hood
And even if i make it away it still ain't gon do me no good
My future remains to be, easy for me, it ain't one to see
Every where that i turn i can't escape reality
The preacher told me a darker past will take away the pain
But i ain't got too long to wait for 23 years its been the same
Now what about (yesterday) all i can do is pray
Cuz tomorrow ain't promising im paranoid with a k
I feel like im fading away and my eye stay too out of focus
So im living for today just incase you haven't noticed

But what about today

[Verse 2]
Every day i try to maintain and hope the worst dont come to get me
Today is all i can see and tomorrow don got me leary
A bad time, but im feeling my past times
And on top of my sad times im losing my damn mind
I ain't thinking about no (yesterday) and thats the truth
Every time im catchin a grip its like my life will knock me loose
Cuz all my pain explains the true still i try and keep it going
Today is what i can understand cuz everything is showin
It is what it is there ain't no mistakin hopin and dazing
This life i live with me is real it ain't nothin amazing
I take it like its my last and clear the rest out of my way
From yesterday and tomorrow and try to think about today

But what about today

[Verse 3]
I know that i got one life to live and i can't focus on a dream
The past don put me on my ass cuz everything ain't what it seem
Reminiscing give me the trip i tried to block it out
Cuz memories will be the reason suicide will take me out
This how one might be my last and i dont wan think about it
If its time for me to kno i ain't gon try to get up out it
Now days be so dramatic like my time be runnin thin
Everytime i feel its over hard times keep killin 'gain
Just like (yesterday) it hurt but i can take it
In the den below (??) my back riding ruff but i can shake it
Will i make it, ill never know cuz my future will never show
So im stuck on the day everything else im lettin go
