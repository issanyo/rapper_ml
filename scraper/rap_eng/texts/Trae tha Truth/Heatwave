[Intro: Martha Reeves and the Vandellas]
Whenever I'm with him
Something inside
Starts to burning
And I'm filled with desire
Could it be a devil in me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?
It's like a heat wave
Burning in my heart (It's like a heat wave)
I can't keep from crying (It's like a heat wave)
It's tearing me apart

[Verse 1: Chiddy]
It's not the same now, we done came round
And turned this music shit into another playground
And they some babies like Huey, bars like a Chewy
Long as life's a movie, I'll be addicted to Louie
Yeah, to all the haters and traitors I need a podium
Benedicts, tell these Arnolds hey, Nickelodeon
Special with decimals, I'm tryna get my point across
Say they love me then they flip sides like a coin toss
Which one, Heads or tails?
The way I kill shit, I should be alleged in jail
I'm on a ledge and still about math, parabola
Legendary shit, wrote raps in my brother's Acura
Back when they used to laugh at ya cause your parents from Africa
President, but you cannot assassinate my character
Yeah, just check the fahrenheit these days
And stay hydrated, welcome to the heat wave

[Hook: Chiddy]
Uh, yeah, it's like a heat wave
There ain't a place we ain't been to these days
Yeah, uh, it's like a heat wave
How we do it make it look so easy
Or is this the way that it's supposed to be?

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Mac Miller, ha ha ha
Ayo, this right here a heatwave, keep it on the replay
Still we droppin' bombs on these records, call it D-Day
Yeah I've heard what he say, thinkin' I ain't shit though
Got these fools pissed like they just stubbed their big toe
All I do is get dough in every single zip code
The walls closin' in right now, you're just a window
Homie, I'm the door from the ceilin' to the floor
When I spit my verse these rappers ain't rappin' anymore
And that's for sure, sorry to get cocky
Just iller than you, and everybody in your posse
Homie, I'm probably chillin' with some punani
Hotter than this wasabi, Pittsburgh boy, Sidney Crosby
Smoke veggies no Casey, no broccoli
Tell your girl if she could please stop callin' me
She buggin', I need to put her on lock
Tired of fuckin' that bitch, so I put her on top

[Hook: Chiddy]
Uh, yeah, it's like a heat wave
There ain't a place we ain't been to these days
Yeah, uh, it's like a heat wave
How we do it make it look so easy
Or is the way it's supposed to be?

[Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]
Listen p
I'm the king and when niggas call the streets independent while niggas trappin'
Duffle basket of the money, applaud with time that's clapping
Ask them why I'm called the truth and I tell you we really rapping
Thugging in the Lamborghini yo something the song has said
But regardless I'm moving slow but I'm tapping on glass
50k sitting up on this watch but I'm watching it pass
Credit ain't nothing if I want it I cop it in cash
Only credit I got is the hood and the city that's theirs
Minus these haters I'm something you might want to duck
Bitches never get close they're something I might want to fuck
Truthfully I'm a beast of this beef get it the fuck up
It's something beating your block like I'm trying to wake it the fuck up

[Verse 4: Casey Veggies]
Motos and four tones they taking at me
And more shine means more dough, it makes me happy
In my city, swear I’m like a young Jay-Z rapping
On the come up while you other niggas faking tactics
I’m in a Dodge Maverick, these hoes live backwards
Sign a contract and dome like five rappers
Build hoes up, I’m like a contractor
I can’t breathe with no air, I gave her mind asthma
Minding my passion is what drives my actions
Barry Bonds rapping, number one draft pick
I never lied, I’d tap it
I get high off actions
I got a high pitch, you would think Mariah had it
Hater nigga pants on fire, he's a liar, ask it
If I could do a verse, but nigga I don’t feel like rapping
Put her in a hearse, kill it, got damn tragic
You gotta know we top billing, I’m the main attraction

[Hook: Chiddy]
Uh, yeah, it's like a heat wave
There ain't a place we ain't been to these days
Yeah, uh, it's like a heat wave
How we do it make it look so easy
Or is the way it's supposed to be?
