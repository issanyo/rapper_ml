[Verse 1: Nipsey Hu$$le]

I dropped seven tapes and it was all the truth
Live my life just like a baller do
Meet a gang of girls and they all be cute
You can fall for me I can't fall for you
I'm in a CL-6 that's the baller coupe
You fuck for cash you a prostitute
Go to school then girl I salute
And make a hunned mill what I'm bout to do
To knock my hustle ain't possible
Me kill you that's optional
Slauson ave I've made lots of moves
Cause I'm a African that think like a Jew
I be doing me, watching you is my example of what not to do
My shoe strings stay Dodger blue
I had a hoop dream but then I caught the flu
Cause the routine is still [?]
And you know I'm a do what I got to do
Picked up the sack, dropped the school
Went hard to the paint, bought some jewels
Switch up my thinking to the proper view
Hopped in this rap, paid all my dues
I was something like an Impala fool
I'm so LA, like a barbecue
These niggas talk a lot, but they wallets mute
I shop a lot, you know cars and shoes
When I hit the block I still rock my jewel
But I ain't one of these niggas that got a lot to prove, nah
I got a lot to do
I wake up nigga to an awesome view
Way these labels tryna deal with rappers got me fuckin' mad like I'm watchin' roots!

[Hook: Nipsey Hu$$le]

Kunta, no no nigga like me
I don't know no nigga like me
I don't know no nigga like me
I don't know no nigga like me

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]

Yeah, haters call now they callin' harder
Truth flies same day departure
Played the bench until I made the starter
Used to play the ball but now I'm ballin' harder
Street nigga can't stay legit
Next check I get I might cop a brick
Keep a tool handy, getcha fixed
Asshole for life its kind of hard to switch
Follow follow my lead, I'm in front of the line
If I don't get it today, then I'm a get it with time
If I don't get it with rap, then I'm a get it with crime
Runnin' in yo crib tryna hit her wit nine
Two door coupe, might cop that twice
Outside was mean, inside was nice
In the hood I'm rollin' I ain't talkin' dice
Fully loaded choppa can't block ya life
What I'm worth you can't hop the price nigga
My advice don't end up hurt nigga
Play with me I bet shit get real
I'm 10 deep with goons and they about that murk nigga
I don't fuck with fuck niggas I'm nothin' like em
Yeah the truth a trip nigga you wouldn't like em
These cars and tents nigga you wouldn't like em
All this shit I'm on nigga you wouldn't like em
