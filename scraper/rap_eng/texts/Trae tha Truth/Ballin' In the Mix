Lil Snupe
Hah, hah
I'm just a young nigga ballin' in the mix, you know
Believe that
Shoutout Houston
Look

[Verse 1: Lil Snupe]
Syrup got me feelin' great, what a wonderful taste
Riding hard through the AZ, jamming that first 48
And it's at this video shoot, that fuck with my nigga Trae
And that nigga Future Freebands, shout out to the A
I'm finna hit the highway, everything's my way
I'm ballin'!
Every day all day
We party, sippin' syrup, swingin' with the Kirko, steady bangin'
Diamonds pressing up against the wood grind wheel
Seein' that nigga Bun B, I'm like this shit for real?
Motherfuckers don't even understand how I feel
Man I knew I'd face time, I come outchea buy a grill
I be at fetish and dreams, me and JR be bootin'
Man I run Louisiana like J Prince run Houston
Rest in peace AJ Dub, K and all the niggas gone
As you see inspired me, so now I'm putting it on

[Hook: Lil Snupe]
'Cus I'm ballin', ballin' in the mix!
Everything I done broke best believe I'm gon' fix
I keep ballin', ballin' in the mix!
Only worried bout a dollar, can give a fuck 'bout a bitch
I keep ballin', ballin' in the mix!
Everything I done broke best believe I'm gon' fix
I keep ballin', ballin' in the mix!
Only worried 'bout a dollar, can give a fuck bout a bitch

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Chyeah, stuntin' quicks trunk waver
Schooled up clique tipper
Feelin' like Cinderella walkin' on glass ass slippers
Off in the bank getting dollars for one of these badass strippers
When I'm done it's UPS back to the crib where I ship her
Louie V, no zipper, ball faded with clippers
Off in this old school swingin' like it's never gave in by sippers
Slippers get caught with this chopper, pack it twice, Cindy Lauper
Keep on the streets, I'm on top of yo bitch, oh dick I can't stop her
Bitch I ball 'til I'm fallin', killed em all when I'm crawlin'
Tell them haters get at me, woofers sound like I'm brawlin'
Me and Lil Snupe shinin', conversation was bloody
Bumpy kid I'm reclining, benihana we dinin'
You ain't shit if you ain't screwed up like Fat Pat, Big Mo
Pimp C, AJ, Dub K, Mafio
Screw zoo, Clip D, yea we from the South
And they know it when they hear all the motherfuckin' mouth

[Hook: Lil Snupe]
'Cus I'm ballin', ballin' in the mix!
Everything I done broke best believe I'm gon' fix
I keep ballin', ballin' in the mix!
Only worried bout a dollar, can give a fuck 'bout a bitch
I keep ballin', ballin' in the mix!
Everything I done broke best believe I'm gon' fix
I keep ballin', ballin' in the mix!
Only worried 'bout a dollar, can give a fuck bout a bitch
