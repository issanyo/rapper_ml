Dirty condoms
Got these problems
Tryna end them with some violence
Now I'm wildin'
Bitches riding
Getting sick of all this silence
Bitches know I'm blowin dope
And choking on this reefer smoke
Bitches know I'm blowin dope
And choking on this reefer smoke
AK47 it'll cook you not a weapon
Its a blessing
Get you rested
Indica sativa
I get lifted by this reefer
Man I'm just a fuckin dreamer
And a schemer
Whipping beamers
Only ridin in two seaters
You know how we tote these heaters
Gettin blasted by this passion
My shit got you doing backflips
Like gymnastics
Yeah I'm spastic (ooh)
I'm so wavy
Someone save me
In these waters like the navy
Getting lazy
You don't wanna see me when I'm gettin crazy
You don't want to see the child of the devil
On your level
Don't get settled
I'm the best don't need a medal
You look disheveled
Torture you
No remorse for you
You know that I'm torchin you
No lighter needed
This heat steady forcing through
Im forcing through
