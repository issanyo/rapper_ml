Chea...Monster

[Hook]
The devil working so I pray
Cause what I'm holding, I'ma spray
I don't wanna die today
Too many niggas acting gay
And I don't got no time to play
The squad I got is on the way


[Verse One: Trae Tha Truth]
Asshole to society, navigating this Chevy
I'm just tryna pull up and hit 'em with something heavy
Tryna Kevin Hart me a nigga, he wasn't ready
Bullets got him doing the Wap, like he was Fetty
God fearing gangsta, nigga, don't get it twisted
Bitch, I been the king of the streets, you couldn't miss it
Tryna see my powers, don't worry, it wasn't listed
One shot, all on the line, you better risk it
Bet yo bitch do, when I pull thru
Yeah, she a monster with the head, I'm tryna fuck her too
And when I finish, I get out and jump in something new
A bunch of pussy niggas hating, so I'm never through
I hit up 'Ton and Don The Boss, what's cracking with it?
Streets looking kinda lost, so I'm back to get it
Slab sailing thru the South and I was captain in it
I keep a trap full of work, you think a staff was in it


[Hook]
The devil working so I pray
Cause what I'm holding, I'ma spray
I don't wanna die today
Too many niggas acting gay
And I don't got no time to play
The squad I got is on the way


[Verse Two: Jay'Ton]
Asshole By Nature is the definition
Niggas playing games, got my full attention
Send goons at noon, on an expedition
Have 'em shooting tunes out that Expedition
With the full extension, respect the game
I'm talking bird for bird, they underneath the plane
Talking check for check, I never need the fame
Drop cocaina, never seen a stain
Whole team in the ghetto
Codeine, kush, I'm a fiend in the ghetto
Hustle got a nigga living dreams in the ghetto
Bitch, I'm in the hood, you never seen in the ghetto
Look, fuck nigga, jump fly and I'ma pull up
Seven six-two's go to flying, get you put up
Ten toes down, everyday a nigga stood up
Now I'm at the crib, one deep, with my foot up


[Hook]
The devil working so I pray
Cause what I'm holding, I'ma spray
I don't wanna die today
Too many niggas acting gay
And I don't got no time to play
The squad I got is on the way


[Verse Three: Trae Tha Truth]
When it come to the streets, every nigga gotta see me
Everything I do a movie, shoulda been on TV
Go to playing tough, homicide, call the PD
Chopper hit ya whip, get ya spinned, like a CD
Riding for my niggas in the cell, 'til they be free
Playing with the keys like a Mac or a PC
Swear a nigga hustle got the world tryna be me
Niggas out here tryna be the man, but I be he
Money resonated over waters for me and my team
Way I got it Coming To America, call me Hakeem
You don't see my hustle something serious, get ya Visine
Ya gal recognize it, that's probably why she gon' try  things
Yeah, I pull up in fly things, it ain't no way to stop that
The hood is where I rock at
Trip and get ya popped at
Asshole sailing this ship, like "where the dock at?"
Throw mine, let one in the chamber of something cocked back
