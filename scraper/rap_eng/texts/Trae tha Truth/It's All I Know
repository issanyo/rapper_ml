[Trae:]
(It's all I Know) chea
Say give me that pistol my nigga
(Gotta get it)
It's all I Know
Mother fuckers always talking bout what they should of did
Or what they would of done in a situation
(Fuck what they talking Bout)
Look you don't know what the fuck a nigga been through out here

[Verse 1: Messy Marv]
Look Donnie I'm from a place we will fuck you up
In chase you down, the silva Roam nigga the lone town
Late night around this mutha fucka I ain't blew
No big backyards, no swimming pools
Just coke white t's man and dope money
We introduce the system trying take my life from me
I left my baby mama for another bitch
Young nigga trying creep on a another lick
Them white boys jump out on a nigga quick
Had to throw away a gun in another clip
They want me to go to church, but I'm not a saint
Ya homey a hypocryte, this what a nigga ain't
I squeeze triggers man them bullets fly
Right After that muther fuckers call homocide
If you don't put in work your stomach growl
Then they take you to trial, nigga you don't know what I been through

[Verse 2: Trae]
I tell em times hard, the pain is even harder
I used to pray for help but now I don't even bother
They tell me life a bitch.and I ain't got a chance
Now I'm in all black pistol in back my pants
Before it's over, know somebody gunna have to come get me
And if I go some one gunna have to come with me
I struggled all my life this here ain't nothing new
And fuck switching it up nigga who the fuck is you
Thugging for plenny days, thugging for plenny nights
With this shit in my trunk, dodgeing them colored lights
They say my life is dark, my future was never bright
Some people say I'm wrong, I tell'em ain't nothing right
I barely sleep when I do it's somewhere locked away
It ain't for long, I'm trafficing these blocks about a block away
Haters trying block this chopper, cocked they ain't gunna block today
Many blocks I got come up short they gunna get rocked away
My brother doing life, I told him I'd be coming for him
If my ass don't make it through this trip tell em it wasent for him
If I end up back on my ass everybody is dinner
You let me eat you get to live everybodys a winner
I'm in the bottom where devil even scared to come
And little homies keep artillery equipped with drums
Chea, all I know is I'm a make it bitch
They say this shit is for the taking, I'm take it bitch

[Bridge/Hook: Trae]
I tell em times hard, the pain is even harder
I used to pray for help but now I don't even bother
They tell me life a bitch.and I ain't got a chance
Now I'm in all black pistol in back my pants
Before it's over, know someone gunna have to come get me
And know if I go some one gunna have to come with me
I struggled all my life this here ain't nothing new
And fuck switching it up nigga who the fuck is you

(And fuck switching it up nigga who the fuck is you) [x2]

I tell em times hard, the pain is even harder
I used to pray for help but now I don't even bother
They tell me life a bitch.and I ain't got a chance
Now I'm in all black pistol in back my pants
Before it's over, know someone gunna have to come get me
And know if I go some one gunna have to come with me
I struggled all my life this here ain't nothing new
And fuck switching it up nigga who the fuck is you
