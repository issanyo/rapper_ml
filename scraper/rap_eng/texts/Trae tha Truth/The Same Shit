(*talking*)
Shit a trip mayn, ery'body want you to be all thefuck they want you to be
Nigga need to understand man, this shit the same nigga
We doing shit what's best for us right now, know I'm saying
We can't be out here, living for everybody else
Gotta do you, that's just what that is man
We grind and bust our ass man, to eat ten plus
Know I'm saying, since a nigga was twelve years old
24 now, you do the math I'm proud of everything a nigga done

[Trae]
How the fuck they say I don't show up no mo', like I ain't the nigga that put that street shit back on
Motivation for niggas to grind, and get they pack on
Been struggling since a teen and I don't wanna back track, plus I love my mama's smile
Heavenly father watch over my days, and bless your child
Half the time I wanna do my best to try, do my best not to cry do my best not to lie
But do the time I did, my best to get by while life went by
I'm not so young no mo', barely grown but everything that I do count
I'm still the same but running with caution, cause I don't wanna get took out
1999 I started the life, of showing you all of my pain
Did it for what it was worth, but now these haters keep on calling my name
Already done showed me love, but since they don't gorillas be quick to click
Quick to draw the line on certain shit, these niggas unable to fix
So I'm alone, trying to get this scratch before I be kicking it up the way with Pat
Watching my hood go round and round, but some of this shit ain't coming back
I watch the game observed, everything I need to see
The world is what it is from here on back, how it use to be

[Boss]
I try to keep it copestetic, when it could be all to the G
I'm in the coupe hiding extra clips, banging "All Eyez on Me"
Cause I don't want these coward niggas, to try to ride on me
I dropped the back right and lift the left front, and then glide on three
And slide on by to my hide away, gotta keep watching my high today
The laws pulled up two deep, they tried to run doubles on my ride today
I put my pride to seat, cause I gotta stack my change
And keep these bitches off my dick, and get these roaches out of my range
Ain't gon mention no names, fuck around and make a nigga have to put six in your brain
Your body will drip to the drain, fuck with us feel it slip and stain
I keep on dipping corners, where the G's be at
When you get deep it's sick in the B your B's up, cause these niggas here will squeeze gats
52 unlimited B's, I'm shaking these fleas and grizzats
Ahead of the pizzack, me and my niggas stay strizzapped with a mizzack
Gotta get ride of the sizzack where the clips at, for five of the mishap
Anybody killers are back with a brand new hit sack, it's like that

[Trae]
Straight up I gotta be a G to the fact, these niggas don't know what's thorough
And the fact they love to play, is really what's keeping me off of payroll
I conversated with my cousin, for the first time in a while
Let him know shit just ain't that bad, my mind fell off in a zone to raise my child up
Still the same nigga though I'm drifting off, trying to stay at my best
Even if they get me hold your head, you gon be blessed I'm moving honest
I'ma continue to ride, through the life is making me out of a man
I gotta be strong and plant my feet above the sand, that's the plan
They told me Trae that shit ain't you, in fact me I probably would of been leaving
And plus I would of let off the shots, to try to make them niggas bleed
You tried to fuck over me and Jay'Ton, ain't feeling me taking it back
Right is right and wrong is wrong, but haters be taking me off of my track
And I ain't gon be no bitch, ready to get my city you can get swallowed
Plus these scary niggas pack some'ing, that's fully equipped with something hollow
Dream is gon be soon to follow, trying to make his daily rounds
But I'll be damned if I make the pit, cause A.B.N. won't let me down
