[Intro]
Yeah, it's another 48, huh?
Aight, H-Town I gotchu

[Hook: x2]
Rollin' dine the slab and I still look good
Pouring up the deuce and acting bad for my hood
Rollin' dine the slab and I still look good
Pouring up the deuce and acting bad for my hood

[Verse 1:]
I'm rollin' in the slab and I still look good
Throwin' up the [?] and actin' bad for my hood
Tell 'em I ain't trippin', If I had to jump lit his ass
[?]
On this glass I'm coastin', everything's slow motion
10 thousand dollar paint got me wet as the ocean
Sailing through the city in the swager on my ocean
Everything get dropped when they see it approaching
I'mma do it like Pat, HA dub k
Then there represent twin towers, ain't Trade
Can't forget about Screw, yea nigga we the shit
Anytime you see me, tellin' me Screwed Up Click

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Uh I'm rollin, nigga I'm holdin'
Paper tags and the damn thing's stolen
Bunch of niggas waiting on The Truth to fall off
I'm a full time jock, tell 'em call off
I keep bangin' the back with the trunk up
And got that thang in the back if you fuck up
I see you niggas steady watching me
Don't watch me, bitch you can't stop me
I don't get mad, I just get bread
I don't fall in love, I just get head
I representin' for the city, nothin' less
This for the north and the south, I'm south west

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Top let down, man hold up
Money workin' out, got my pocket swole up
Glass look amazing everytime I roll up
Trae hotter than the summer but the Rollie froze up
Hoes all on me so I guess I'm chose up
You can tell I'm going in when I let the doors up
Face goes down when the ass goes up
If she opened up, I ain't leavin' till it closed up
Slow loud and bangin' while I'm slidin' my slab
Trunk hittin' hard like [?]
H-Town Texas nigga you know how it goes
Get money, bitch I'm ballin' with the pros

[Hook]
