[talking: Trae]
Cheyah
They say I'm still on that same old shit
Ha Ha
Okay
Let's get it
Uh
Your now tuned in to the streets
Such a regular broadcast had just been canceled
Trae Tha Truth
King of the streets
And this a new one this year
Street's Advocate, nigga

I heard some niggas trippin'
What it is mayne
Bitch I'm a grown man
I ain't for playing games
A major factor in the city that these niggas claim
And in a corner gangstas they yelling a nigga name
Some haters want me in the streets, well what'cha waiting on?
You gone need more then paramedics try'na take me home
I'm goin' expose any character try'na play me wrong
I beat that ass outta order like you was... (Mike Jones)
I heard the logic tell a fake niggas fall as he get
Well bitch I'm right here now they ain't gotta be dealing shit
These niggas mo' pussy then bitches who famous in flicks
These niggas sick the truth the only one issue in hits
I heard it's mercies, just give me a reason
And I see something through that household that rep when you leasing
It's me against the world I'm feeling like I'm Michael Vick
The industry don't wanna see the truth, tell them niggas to quit
I ain't a Rap-A-Lot no mo' Records serving the rabbit
But me and Jay Brothers for life, fuck with him and I'm scraping
First nigga track goin' be an example ya think we slacking
This A.B.N. Rap-A-Lot Mafia, bitch what's happenin'
I went to sleep and woke up with the same vision as Pac
And let this unified go and re-incorated the block
I rep the streets cause I'm the king and niggas know I'm in it
These niggas rap about the hood but me I go up in it
Tell the media fuck they camera, I ain't photogenic
But picture this standing out on some four doors and tinted
See I expose them in the light, then I damage they image
With these gorillas pumping something the color of spinach
My street credibility straight, it ain't nothing to fix
I did a show running my man told em copy my brick
Fuck a case, these bullets will drop of a snitch
So let em know the hood I be, I be hopping this bitch

[Talking:]
That's the realest shit I ever wrote, nigga
(Why they keep on calling my name?)
You know, I don't know what the fuck they been sleeping on
(Why they keep on calling my name?)
I feel like I need to slap they ass across the head and wake em back up this year
(Why they keep no calling my name?)
You know, I ain't gotta jock no album, huh, I gotta drop mixtapes in days
(Why they keep no calling my name?)
You know I am commonly, it this goin be how I feel like being in a tentery
I'm on some, I'm on some real nigga shit right now
You know all these bugs gotta take care, move them out the fuckin' way
Streets Advocate is here
I don't think they even wanna see me mayne
Fuck this, they don't wanna see me period
Well get'cha best of the best mayne, ya favorite rapper
I'm out of here
Tell them niggas find me in the hood mayne
No telling what a nigga got going on
But oh yeah
If you don't know, nigga
It bout to be a muthafuckin' problem
The Truth is on the way
Holla at me
Ayyo, Boss
I think we need to pull out the forum on swangs
I made history homie
Ha Ha Ha
Fuck with us, nigga
King of the muthafuckin' streets
I'm just now starting to have my muthafuckin' fun, nigga
The Street's Advocate, nigga
Ha Ha
Why they keep on calling my name?
Cheyah!
