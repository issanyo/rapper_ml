[Hook: YC]
Got campaign goin' so strong
Gettin' brain when I'm talkin' on the phone
Spendin' money when your money is long
Real street niggas, ain't no clone
We at the top where we belong
Drink lean, Rosé, Patrón
Smokin' on a thousand dollars worth strong
When the club 'bout to hear this song

We got racks on racks on racks (racks)
Racks on racks on racks (racks)
Racks on racks on racks (racks)
Got racks on racks on racks
Got racks on racks on racks (racks)
Racks on racks on racks (racks)
Racks on racks on racks (racks)
Racks on racks on racks
Nigga, I ain't even trynna hold back

[Verse: Trae The Truth]
I'm in the club, tryna show 'em how to stunt (Stunt)
Tryna pick up what I'm throw, it prolly take about a month (Month)
The club underwater, have 'em runnin' out the front
While I'm somewhere in the back, gettin' blowed like a blunt (Blunt)
No need to trip, you can tell 'em that I'm cool as hell (Cool as hell)
Cause it's the case I know the pack of pumas well (Pumas well)
I'm a blood motherfucker, that dude'll tell (Dude'll tell)
Got 47 'neath the old-school as well (School as well)
I got lights on my wrist that'll flash like cop (Cops)
Couple of foreign cars that I ride no top (Tops)
Couple of whi-whips that I ride like yachts (Yachts)
A couple of haters lookin', I'm knowin' them niggas hot (Hot)
And tell 'em that I don't give a damn
Hard as a motherfucker, tell 'em I was HAAM
Call it what you want, I'mma do it for the fam
Yeah, that's the type of nigga that I am
