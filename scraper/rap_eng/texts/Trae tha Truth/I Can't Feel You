[Verse 1:]
Got a lot on my mind not enough time on my hand
I got to shop some things that i do
But niggers want to fuck up my plans
I put a lot of trust in you
But you don’t know how to carry that
I guess it is my fault
I believe that you will give it back
Shit lonely when you stressing
But fuck it nobody owe me so
Take it i don't think i accept it for
They show me same way
When I’m in need these niggers they dont know me
What the love turn into hate if they cannot grow me
I use to be one of the closest now they
Act like i ain't done shit
This loyalty unhealthy like it’s cancer shit i been sick
Niggers can say these shit just so they can come up quick
These bitches out here play for whatever they can catch a quick lift
The snake travel in packs so I’m traveling back so i chose to be independent
They do so many rocks so that the council had to defend it
They focus on the gram so they don't know they imidrated
So the day i decide to be solid no one they timid

[Chorus:]
Am a fighter got the heart of a lion
With the strength of a million
No  fear I’m like zion
Live like a titan
I go to the war with the mighty
The people will expire
So do whatever you desire
But if i was still young
And now that you play with me like that
Now i see the real you
You don't give a damn so i had to fall back
But nigga i dont want you
Now everybody gotta fight their own damn war
You know that i was true for you
And it's sad to say it ain't like that no more
No more I guess

[Verse 2:]
I guess that's how it goes when they benefitting they reserve you
They playing you to the end when they know they don't deserve you
They not there to say that's a hit nobody get it nobay heard you
But they take your story to the next person only reword it
This pain ain't even mine no more these niggers different so
So this time i ain't going to find no more
I use to benefit you but no time no more
They even madder now they can't shine no more
I guess they fucked up they jealous
The jealousy comes so fluent the plan they had was ruined
Telling me they going to rize but when the person they hate was through it
Even though inside I’m pissed i just let it go because i knew it
Watching from distance like a stadium when i view it

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
It's only for the moment [x2]
It's all up in the moment
You don't even know me
