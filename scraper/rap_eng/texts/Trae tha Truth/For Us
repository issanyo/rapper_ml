[Chorus: Paxquiao]
Lot-lot-lot of things changed, I done came up
Since I came up, niggas hate hard, I just play the cards how they dealt
With the same guys, we the same guys who called for help
I did it with my niggas, I ain't do it by myself
Do it for, do it for, for my family and friends
You know I got you 'til the end
Buyin' shit I never had, finally got some cash, I can brag
Bitch, I'm doin' good, made it out the hood, now they mad

[Verse 1: Paxquiao]
Some people, you grow apart from
You just gotta stay on your shit
Ayy, this shit a gamble, it's hit or miss
Four flat, I'm runnin' to the bag
Mash the gas, ain't no time to relax
Hope these demons stay far from us, I'm tryna make a mark for us
Tryna stay focused, I'm tryna go far for us
I feel it all in my soul
Hopin' that the pain go away
I could never change, no way
Bitches think they slick, tryna run back
See a nigga piped, tryna come back
I could change your life, I know you want that
Diamonds wet, private jet, bitch, I'm goin' on
Put my dawg on when I get on, let's keep it goin'

[Chorus: Paxquiao]
Lot of things changed, I done came up
Since I came up, niggas hate hard, I just play the cards how they dealt
With the same guys, we the same guys who called for help
I did it with my niggas, I ain't do it by myself
Do it for, do it for, for my family and friends
You know I got you 'til the end
Buyin' shit I never had, finally got some cash, I can brag
Bitch, I'm doin' good, made it out the hood, now they mad

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
Told my dawg we on for real
Applyin' pressure, never chill
Still with him in the field
It's us or them until we kill
'Til the death, a will of steel
Haters blockin' like a shield
Came from nothin', time to live
Drippin' on 'em, take a spill
Used to come down in the back of a 'Lac
Never went back when I got me a sack
Now I jump on the plane and I don't even pack
Do not get in foreigns unless it was black
Others be fakin', they caught in the act
These niggas ain't worthy, I'm watchin' my back
Probably 'cause they know they hustle is whack
Do niggas dirty for less than a stack
I'm on the way to the top today
Tell 'em my focus don't stop today
They competition, but not to Trae
You don't want no problems, stay out the way
I'm from the town with the land of Glocks
Came from the corner with hands of rocks
New Desert Eagle, might land your flock
King of the street, I demand the blocks

[Chorus: Paxquiao]
Lot of things changed, I done came up
Since I came up, niggas hate hard, I just play the cards how they dealt
With the same guys, we the same guys who called for help
I did it with my niggas, I ain't do it by myself
Do it for, do it for, for my family and friends
You know I got you 'til the end
Buyin' shit I never had, finally got some cash, I can brag
Bitch, I'm doin' good, made it out the hood, now they mad
