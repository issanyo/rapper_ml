[Hook: MDMA]
Is it a lie? So you're not the one to blame
Or do you hide so you don't have to face tha pain?
Can you explain how you've come to change
Cuz I just don't get it... Noo-oo

[Intro: Trae]
I don't get it
Damn
It's crazy how the ones you look out for so quick to switch up on you

[Verse 1: Trae]
I never thought that I be filing like Gengo & get the best of me
I swear the only one I love be the pepole who testin me
I still can't figure where everything went wrong
They said they got my back, but now I understand that shit gone
Instead of standing up for what you did, you let me fight pain
And it was him or me never once that I complained
I just took it and smile, somewhere off in the rain
Knowin you wish I get the worst shit, I remain the same
You say I'm trippin, but the one we need to blame is you
Through everthing the only thang that change is you
Realizing that you ain't gon get it together
It's all far gone, it ain't no way to get better

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae]
Sometimes I question my self, asking what I did
I always thought I kept it without and what the fuck I did
I just keepin it real and tell your he truth is what made you
Run off and hide away and relocate to something new
They tell me time'll make hard I feel as rough as hell
I ain't shed a tears in a minute I ain't fill of not I wish you well
Your loyalty went out the windowl like a piece of trash
I probly'll never see it again (I probly'll never see it again)
Your ways are something like the wind, you're invisible for me
But at the same time how you rock is so visible to me
They told me misery loves company and that might be
And if it's true that ain't for me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trae]
Take a look in a mirror and tell me what you see
Am I really trippin is evertyhing becasue of me
Or is the reality of it something you deny it
And everything you did you never done I just sit and to lie
Common you and I both know what I stand fo'
I look to you for help, but you reached out to let my hand go
It's all good you don't owe me nothing, bet that
Every table gon turn and that's the day you gon regret that
I know to strugle like the street that I'm roamin alone
Alone is how I get mi peace and now its my home
The shake of a hand, the only thing I can give you
I'mma live up to the lord to forgive you
