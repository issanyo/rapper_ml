[Intro]
Fuck calling me right now?
Hello
Yo
Hold on nigga, what the fuck you talking about?
Nigga my motherfucking day ain't even started yet
You on my motherfucking line
Type of gay ass shit is this?
But this could go one of two ways man
Either you gonna let me continue about my business
Or y'all about to have a motherfucking problem nigga
Fuck wrong with you? Get off my line bitch
Stupid motherfucker

[Hook]
Bitch, don't live my life
Homie it ain't hiding today
I'm in this alright, and it's written all over my face
I'm feeling fucked up
Bitch you got me fucked up
These niggas got me fucked up
Fuck the world's end today
Today, fuck 'em

[Verse 1]
Went to sleep tripping, woke up felling like "fuck 'em"
It hard to be humble when these snakes ans hyenas rush ya
Irritation at an all time high, nothing about him
Just a temper in a clip full of bullets, fuck your discussion
Wish a motherfucker would jump high, he gonna be buzzing
Look people, I've been minding my business, why the fuck you fussing?
I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do bitch
I'm real, I'm not like you bitch
So please don say the wrong shit
Ain't no maybes, I'ma come through bitch
No pass, oh yes
Nigga fuck with Trae and get fucked up
Yeah, I've got an attitude like I was Eric Wright
Covered in all black and then ticked off
You better leave me alone, get me wrong
One word, you'll have a nigga all up in your home
This shit I'll only say for a nigga hating, hitting 9-1-1
Now I'm all up in your phone
Yeah,  shit I'll only say for a nigga hating, hitting 9-1-1
Now I'm all up in your phone

[Hook]
Bitch, don't live my life
Homie it ain't hiding today
I'm in this alright, and it's written all over my face
I'm feeling fucked up
Bitch you got me fucked up
These niggas got me fucked up
Fuck the world's end today
Today, fuck 'em

[Verse 2]
I'm on some other shit
Pussy ass niggas flyer than birds
Give a fuck about you
I'll get you cancelled playing with words
I know this bitch on side of me only good for working my nerves
All this drama, hoe approach me with caution
You better swerve
Shit was written on my face
Let a nigga trip disrespect that
I click first, I don't sit back
You slide now, I can't get that
I guess that's just the motion
But I know the day I'm owed one
In this white Murci√©lago
Mercy, I ain't gonna show none
Hoe shit? I don't know one
I'm king, recognizing no one
I hit it like I can't turn down
You might get a kid with no refund
I'ma show a nigga with no rewind
So if I said it, I meant it nigga
Just know you got me fucked up
Don't try shit 'cause I'm with it nigga
Just know you got me fucked up
Don't try shit 'cause I'm with it nigga

[Hook]
Bitch, don't live my life
Homie it ain't hiding today
I'm in this alright, and it's written all over my face
I'm feeling fucked up
Bitch you got me fucked up
These niggas got me fucked up
Fuck the world's end today
Today, fuck 'em

[Outro]
Today, fuck 'em
Today, fuck 'em
Today, fuck 'em
