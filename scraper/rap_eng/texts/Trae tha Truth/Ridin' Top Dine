[Intro]
Drive sometime ride for free
Ride sometime ride for free
Save them money

[Verse 1]
Pull up in the hood though
You see the dub is understood though
You fuck with me and it’s no good though
Now just let me get back to that wood though
This is foreign don’t try for murder
Evening cold on my body
I’m just minding business got bitches all in my lobby
Like biggie they want a chance, chances I ain’t gonna give up
Quality high standards told me you got to deliver
I’m still stuck back in nine c chromes I flipped in the nine bricks
In the hood by nine who to click, told me I don’t forget shit
Broke ass niggas I fix shit thanks to women that's real spit

[Hook]
Drive sometime ride for free
Ride sometime ride for free

Ride sometime ride for free
Save them money
Ride sometime ride for free
Save them money

[Verse 2]
Trunk is open all of my swingers poking
Fuck with me must be joking
Top is crack like it’s smoking rocket is something vintage
Keep presidential spinach balls is up for scrimmage
Real with it fuck the image
And they might just fight ya
Fireman might just light ya
Miggas they might just bite ya
Real niggas they can just bite  ya
Pussy I don’t invite ya
Do something interesting for mankind
I see you mention bitch stay inline
Fuck you trying to steal mine
It’s screwed up for life nigga
Yea I rip that ace time
This ain’t place to take a wife nigga
Got that call from paco
After bitch I got this
Like when I don’t got shit
Fuck niggas can’t stop shit

Through that shit representing ace town and within
Now we so true instead of poppin trunks and
Jammin through

Through that shit representing ace town and within
Now we so true instead of poppin trunks and
Jammin through
