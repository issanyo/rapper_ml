[Intro: Trae tha Truth]
I shine bright like a diamond, I shine bright like a diamond
I shine bright like a diamond, I shine bright like a diamond
I shine bright like a diamond

[Hook: Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond

[Verse 1]
What a wonderful fucked up life, looking to get some closure
Opposite of these fuck niggas trying to get exposure
Haters in violation, trust nothing of what they showed ya
Battle em til it's over, Trae going up like a soldier
Tell em I've been in the back
Sick of motherfuckers looking over this life of mine
My [?] is time to shine
To the point that they're going blind
I've been through so much my testimony say [?] look up
I got the hood, I hope the risk will hold up
Get this money til my desk can't fold up
I gotta win
Tried to close the door but I got up in
I done missed my shot then shot again
My time to go, I ain't stopping again
Know the road is rough but I'm a high beam
So many can get it and lose it
Not me, you gon' know when I choose it
You can tell em I'm determined to get it
And if I want it, ain't no way to refuse it
I told my grandfather I'll shine for em just like a diamond
Even though it's dark I told em spark the light and you can find em
For those who tried to shit on me, I'm right here to remind em
The true focus on moving forward like you can't rewind

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
King of the streets, 13 bust tell em I've been that
Even though they left me missing
Tell them bitch niggas I've been back
I'm something like a diamond deep in the dirt but now I done rose up
You can close your eyes if you want, but in my presence shit get rose up
Position til I chose up, right after that go all in
Yeah then go get this work if they don't want it tell em call in
Nigga I'm a boss, you out here stressing tryna work for higher
You wanna be me, no listeril, what the fuck what it requires
Yeah, I shine bright like a diamond
I was promised to see the top and got to climb it on my way
Ain't no less than being great like Muhammad was speaking tree
All I know is handle business, if not then I'm in the way
And I take a team but niggas stop this lane of mine, I'm like nights in Manhattan
I'm in the game that make the plays, now they calling me Madden
And yes I love to make bitter
But I don't give a fuck, the world is mine and I'm gon kill her
For real nigga

[Hook]
