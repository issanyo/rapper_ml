It be the same situation, round this motherfucker
Niggas hate ya for what you got, and trying to keep it undercover
It's a dirty game, so I gotta play it how it go
And even niggas from your frontline, learn to hate behind a hoe
Even niggas from my set, don't even wanna see me breathing
But I swear if I get test, somebody family gon be grieving
Yeah and still I'm never tripping, shit be going through my mind
I let my mind override my anger, so I don't get hit with time
But I guess I'm doing fine, niggas know who got the throne
Fuck the industry, and I advise them fake ass niggas leave me alone
So I click first, I won't let em take me out my zone
They don't know shit, they's rather hear Flip or Mike Jones
Disrespected yep, everytime I spit my lines
One of the hardest motherfuckers, when I spit my lines
A Asshole, but I use to be a cool lil' nigga
Until my nigga's smile, turned to a frown behind my figgas
I won't let it come to triggers, I remember everything
We use to ride or die together, now I'm stuck feeling the pain
But I learned to maintain, and operate from a distance
Don't get it twisted, if you need me I'll be there in an instance
Ms. Danielle, I really hate you turned out to be fake
Fucking with these ol' roach ass niggas, to be your mate
Just wait, and watch how fast this nigga Trae rise
I know you sick, cause I can see it in your eyes

[Hook Trae & Dallas - 2x]
Y'all, should of knooooown
I'ma take, my throooone

[Trae]
What the bidness is, everybody act like I owe em some'ing
Keep fucking up my mood, it's garunteed I will show em some'ing
I heard I got a price on my head, in ATX
Ronnie Joe, just know that if someone get touched you gon be next
And you can take it as a threat, or you can leave it where it's at
Cause if you come at me again, you or something gon get a tech
My tolerance kinda low, and that explains my attitude
The only one that get respect is my mama, cause she will lend the gratitude
Tell me father can you help me, cause my vision is blury
It's like these niggas know my status, so they rush in a flury
It's hard to tell what's in they heart, so I don't even give it time
I remember '99, some of you niggas wasn't down
And the rap game the same, it depends who hot
These niggas'll cut ya, it just depends how fast you flop
So fuck a feature, and I don't give a fuck about collabbing
Only loyalty I got, is from the ruger that I'm grabbing
Fuck how you niggas feel, bout skills
Cause ninety-nine point nine percent of you niggas, don't even keep it real
Worried about, if a nigga gon outshine they ass
Ask me if been to give it, cause they sound like trash
Oh if I mark my words, if I ain't dead by now
These niggas pussy, and I'm bout to lose my head right now
And on the cool, you can only imagaine if niggas true
Read they eyes in conversation, and watch what them niggas do

[Hook - 2x]

(*talking*)
Me and my motherfucking team, we gon take the throne nigga
We don't need no motherfucker, to give it to us
We gon earn that we gon take that nigga, and a fight go with that nigga
Y'all know y'all ain't seeing us nigga, we been doing this shit since '97 nigga
For deep, we ain't never dropped nothing whack nigga
Always drop, motherfucking ghetto classics nigga
Always kept the hood on fire, remember that nigga
Better check your motherfucking background, stats ain't changed nigga
This the Asshole By Nature, Slow Loud And Bangin'
Screwed Up motherfucking Click
The same motherfucker from Guerilla Maab, feel what I'm saying
That's who I be nigga, Trae ain't shit changed motherfucker
