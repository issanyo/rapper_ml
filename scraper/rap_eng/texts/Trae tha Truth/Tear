[Hook (2x): samples "Be Careful" by Sparkle]
Tear down the walls in this house*
Tear down the walls in this house
Tear down the walls in this house
Tear down the walls in this house

[Verse 1:]
I remember dreaming like a king but misery had did no fucked up
Pain turned into fame and had me looking like I looked up
Cherishing every moment time running so far away
Instead of looking for hope I take hate and call it a day
I feel it in the air, tension crowding up my atmosphere
I take it as it is it ain't no happy feelings passing here
It's hard to say who love me money got the picture frame it
You can't explain going through shit when people think you made it
Everybody got opinions they don't know what's going on
I tell em leave me in that zone and end with fuck alone
I'm feeling trapped inside my home the pressure got me nervous
Praying like a deeking at a church still ain't been to service
And I feel like this attention left my baby momma with a grudge
I give my kids the world so why the fuck I'm stuck in front this judge
I try patience but it's hard to use it round this motherfucker
Somebody help me 'fore I lose it round this motherfucker

Tear down the walls in this house
Tear down the walls in this house
Tear down the walls in this house
Tear down the walls in this house

[Verse 2:]
I'm less than a minute away
Going upside this wall with either my head and my hand
I [?] myself to live for what I love I'm watching it sink in sand
I feel that down so much the anger got me like I'm trippin'
It's hard to be a stand-up nigga when ya life is slippin'
Sometimes I wish to bring my partna's back up out the round
Instead of me crying out through this pain and letting it out the sound
I'm on my own cause when I look for help it's not around
They say they only wait but end them off like they was out of town
My homeless faking any breath of air to snuck about it
I need to bin before I take these wall the fuck up out it
I'm burn this bitch up for I let it hurt me any longer
Shit got me rough as hell I doubt it make me any stronger
The only piece of mind I get is looking at my ceilings
Sometimes it ain't nothing other days it's a wonderful feeling
I close my eyes and end up headed where they say it's danger
I rather be there cause here is nothing but familiar strangers

[Hook: x2]
Tear down the walls in this house
Tear down the walls in this house
Tear down the walls in this house
Tear down the walls in this house
Tear down the walls in this house... [until fades out]
