[Intro: French Montana]
How we do mayne?
That's that shit, Montana, uhh, yeah

[Hook: French Montana]
Your bitch chose a nigga don't be mad
Got pounds of that kush, 40 cal is in my bag
No matter where I'm at, I let that thing go blat
And that cocaine mafia got these niggas mad fosho
Homie it's that cocaine mafia fosho
I could break a brick down, nigga I could break a hoe
I'm a pro, what the fuck you niggas talkin'?
Nigga everything's a go, Montana

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Hop up on a track rape a donna
150 stacks count it back leave the door locked (hold up)
You watching niggas starve while you ate good
Now it's ghetto niggas poppin space call me Ace Hood
Slang wood dick dealer white chinchilla in the huddle
Try'nna bubble like sprite pink syrup
Gotta hit the pot stir it, move an ounce fuck par
And you know never play wit kon a nigga lying like a rug
That coke boy music that kinda shit you get chills for
Round table get the bread and butter 'fore the meal come
Talk about that cocaine mafia, word to Trae I'm the truth
Yelling through the ceiling like "fuck the roof!"
Montana!

[Hook: French Montana]
Your bitch chose a nigga don't be mad

And that cocaine mafia got these niggas mad fosho
Homie it's that cocaine mafia fosho
I could break a brick down, nigga I could break a hoe
I'm a pro, what the fuck you niggas talkin'?
Nigga everything's a go, Montana

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Louis Vuitton 20 bag replacin' that with bags of 'cane
Work inside the back of this '47 white powder frame
Double up the price and it might just get you a fair exchange
Fuck with me your ass'll get chopper weather, I can make it rain
Office like dirt, I take all shots
Believe this, I'm the MVP all blocks
Ducked off, I ain't try'na see no cops
In the Koop I ain't try'na see no tops
Wrist game since try'na see more rocks
Strapped up like I'm try'na see more blocks
Got burr's, I'm try'na see more flocks
Fuck a hater, they ass gon' get dropped
I gotta get dough, gotta get paid
Take a look at me, yeah bitch I'm laid
Any bitch on my dick gon' get played
Any bitch on my dick gon' get laid
Right after she get laid she get lost
At door, hop up fours and floss
Yeah I do me, I ain't worried 'bout the cost
Don't deal with connects, I deal with the boss
On this cocaine mafia, that Rich Porter
Cop it from the border then flush it until the side of order
Tsunami hustle, yeah we flood the block
I ain't talking water motherfucker, watch me flood the block
Talkin' all white

[Hook: French Montana]
Your bitch chose a nigga don't be mad
