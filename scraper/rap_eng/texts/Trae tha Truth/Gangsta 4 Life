[Intro Sample "G4L" by Rihanna]
I'm down for life, gangsta for life
You know I'm down, I'm down for life
Load it, reload it and let's go
Gangster for life, till the day that I die
I promise I'll standing high
Cause you know that I'm down
You know I'm down, gangsta for life

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
It's been a minute, niggas heard from the truth
While they thinking it was over, you can tell 'em that a nigga back
With everything that I lost, I was sick of being shitted on
Tell them that I'm here to pay a nigga back
Fully automatic in the trunk put ya' hands on deck
Somebody going have to get it when I come around
Everybody talk that shit saying they ready for whatever like a G
But when I'm at it, it ain't none around
Homie I ain't nothing like them niggas that you playing with
With any wrong way, I guarantee that niggas spread shit
Take it up there, I put a nigga on his ass
Tryna' take it there, there will be the people that ya' laying with
Bring it to the streets, I can show you what I'm good for
You can find me in the gutta', where you niggas never could go
Jump for real, whether you niggas never could go
24/7, you can find me in the hood ho
For every nigga in the cell, every nigga in the grave
You can tell 'em that I'm riding for the team
For the ones that I feel and the ones who ain't going make it tonight
I'm a finna' show you why they call me the king
Nothing less than a g-a-n-g-s-t-a
Go and give it your best, so wear your vest today
What I'm on will leave you more than stress today
Put ya' on a position where you rest away

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I'm alone at home, loaded back up and then I'm gone
If I'm a get ya' then I'm on my way to show up at ya' door
All I know is if it's time I gotta' go for what I know
You can tell 'em it's fuck 'em until I'm up under the floor
I'm on this backstreet all black lights off
A bunch of bullets ain't no telling where they might floss
If I hit 'em, I bet I got you doing that graveyard shift
For a time, nigga lights off
Call me the weather man
Cause if I come out of the trunk
I guarantee somebody finna' get rained on
Everybody within a hundred yard from head to toe
I swear I'm in the zone like my aim is gone
To everyone that I forgot, I'm coming back for ya'
Tell the team get out the way, I'm finna' bad for ya'
I'm going hard till I even up stats for ya'
I'm the king tell 'em to throw it wear I sat with ya'
Cheeah, I'm in the zone
Somebody put a nigga on before I click it I get with ya'
If I end up up in the cell and never get free
Then everything I represented finna' get with ya'
All I know is for the streets I'm killing this shit
All the niggas bout the money it wasn't for me
Bitch nigga move around it ain't nothing to see
In the legend of the greats is where I'm a be

[Hook]
