[Hook: August Alsina]
Pour some liquor in my cup, shake and stir it up
Pass it up, keep it coming 'til I'm stuffed
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
The club get shut down when I park outside, all eyes on me when I walk inside
Women going everywhere like its undecided, behind these clothes like I'm trying to hide my face
Hey niggas get up out my space, talk Obama, we gon' count the case
Matter of fact where's that bitch with that ass and no waist? I'm tryna use her face
She says she like to be laid back, go hard on film and let her play back
Exotic actress, hood down, she got a shape that a nigga see from way back, way back
She built like Mya, hot get into it it got more fire
I tell her go and blow like wire, rain on her tits right, I might as well go dry her

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
Peach Ciroc & OJ, Chardonnay when I'm thirsty
Shawty say she don't take shots, margarita then ole
Dollar bills and they're stacked up, all my homies be racked up
DJ in the zone so this song about to get back up
Play it again if you fuck with it, NO be my city
Shout out to my Tex niggas who 'trón banging and Syrup
Slipping
ATL I'm here now, looking for that good kush
I saw you when you break down, had me stupid like George Bush

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
I'm on pineapple and 'trón
Puffing on that strong got me feeling like I'm grown
Maybe too young to be just done, I don't care cause it's too fun
And tonight I'm gon' get some, so I'm getting dumb

[Hook: August Alsina]
Pour some liquor in my cup, shake and stir it up
Pass it up, keep it coming 'til I'm stuffed
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Gimme a shawty in my lap, who twerk and make it clap
Then drop it to the floor, get back up and throw it back
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

[Verse 3: August Alsina]
She got hip, she got ass, she got thighs, she got face
She got lips, she got "Fuck me" in her eyes
Now she got so many ones, she look just like a teller
She say "Tell me when to stop" but I don't ever tell her
Cause I'm fucked up on this drink, I can't even think
All she see is money, she can't even blink
All I see is swishas and my niggas tipping
Now I'm seeing double but I'm still sipping

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
I'm on pineapple and 'trón
Puffing on that strong got me feeling like I'm grown
Maybe too young to be just done, I don't care cause it's too fun
And tonight I'm gon' get some, so I'm getting dumb

[Hook: August Alsina]
Pour some liquor in my cup, shake and stir it up
Pass it up, keep it coming 'til I'm stuffed
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Gimme a shawty in my lap, who twerk and make it clap
Then drop it to the floor, get back up and throw it back
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

[Verse 4: 2Win]
Champagne show how to campaign, four whips in that fast lane
Swatch it make it hold that night, already talking 'bout she want a nigga last name
Pimps on the body, we can keep the cup, let's slide to the crib, I wanna beat it up
Depends on how I feel right, heard this shit, know I had to beef it up
Ain't no habit, I'm gone, always smoking that strong
Baby show me that thong, shawty saying this her song
Look how she sliding down that pole, heard I only sold them hoes
Damn that ass sitting on smoke, never see nothing like it before
What it gon' take for you to go? Must've smoke the lean 2o
I'm so high, can't feel my nose, teen magazine the way she pose
Love it when she drop it down real low, 2 litre Sprite mixed with that fo
Got a nigga throwing all his cash, but shawty fast fucking that dough

[Hook: August Alsina]
Pour some liquor in my cup, shake and stir it up
Pass it up, keep it coming 'til I'm stuffed
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Gimme a shawty in my lap, who twerk and make it clap
Then drop it to the floor, get back up and throw it back
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Pour some liquor in my cup, shake and stir it up
Pass it up, keep it coming 'til I'm stuffed
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Gimme a shawty in my lap, who twerk and make it clap
Then drop it to the floor, get back up and throw it back
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
