Chain Aqua No Fena
Got em sleeping no dreamer
Pressing haters no cleaners
Trunk Ike & no Tina
Missed NBA but I'm Ballin
Better get that check cause she callin
Off in that back where I'm Ballin
Then back in traffic no stallin
Gotta couple diamonds in Black

Been to Hell & Back for these Racks
Tell them haters no pressure
These all Whites see I'm fresher
No 48 But I'm Killin
Can I catch a body no stretcher
I Do not know why they watching me
Think I'm picking  the way I get broccoli
I was tasting for mine ain't no watching me
So mistaken as what i was not to be

Bet get that bag then i'm on it
You trying out for your team
Why wait for that when I want it

Now I got it on me me
Pockets never on E
All these Diamonds on me
Kinda hard not to freeze
Now I'm all in my bag
Copped a whip overseas

Now  i got it on me
Pockets never on E
All these diamonds on me
Kinda hard not to freeze

Got em yelling Trae When that truth drop
All eyes on me Like I’m 2 PAC
Still big when I step out
Won’t be no day that I do not
I’m still the king where I stay at
This for the record no play back
She say I’m real & she choosing
So where I’m at when she lay in
Don’t mind me I’m just flexing
Am I broke or not they just guessing
I’m in my bag & it’s my way
Tell me do it look like I’m stressing
Might moonwalk in this big truck
Go to talking slick you might get stuck
I’m so alive & I’m killing
My money long it don’t get touched
I’m screwed up like I’m Big Moe
Still FDB like I’m Young Dro
Yeah everything I do is slow mo
Life high as hell I can’t get low
I got it on me no cap
I remember days in that trap
Like all I know is make plays
Quarterback Like I’m Kap

Now I got it on me
Pocket never on E
All these diamonds on me
Kinda hard not to freeze
Now I’m all in my bag
Copped the whip overseas
I’m just taking my time
You ain’t gotta like these

Now I got it on me
Now I got it on me
Now I got it on me
Now I got it on me
Pocket never on E
All these diamonds
On me
Kinda hard no to
Freeze
