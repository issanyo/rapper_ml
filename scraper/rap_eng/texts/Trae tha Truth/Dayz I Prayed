Call my name (Hey)
So sweet and plain
But now you're gone and the
Pain comes back again
And I find

Dayz I prayed when nights were cold
Nowhere to go but still I roll
Too many lights it take it's toll
So I stay below just play my roll

Stay in your place cause I cannot
Fake it
I would not hide iit no
Father forgive me I know I'm
Sinning
I was just trying to grow
Swear they was shady played me
For crazy
Thinking my eyes were closed
Thought they was was my family I ain't
Deserve
How they tried to play me low

Stay in your place cause I cannot
Fake it
I would not hide iit no
Father forgive me I know I'm
Sinning
I was just trying to grow
Swear they was shady played me
For crazy
Thinking my eyes were closed
Thought they was was my family I ain't
Deserve
How they tried to play me low

They know what it is when I spot
Em
They told me I'll stay at the
Bottom
I give it to all of my people
I want em to know that I got em
Don't matter the weight on my
Shoulders
I stay on roll like a motor
Imma be here when it's over
Don't matter the fight Imma
Soldier

Dayz I prayed when nights were cold
Nowhere to go but still I roll
Too many lights it take it's toll
So I stay below just play my roll

Yeah too many times I felt left out
I was looking for help and nobody
Helped out
Soon as they got they brick
Damn they cripped out
It was under they rug and got
Swept out
I only did it for love but wasn't
Nothing there
I been a one man team nobody
Playing fair
They way they left me alone tell
Them I couldn't care
I know the Devil is working
Somebody say a prayer
I was sick time and time the
Same thing
Never mention King give truth the
Same name
Over twenty years the heat the
Same flame
Tell'em they be in but leave the
Same game
All these dayz I prayed I'd get a
Fair shot
These niggas ten on one can't get a
Fair block
Hustle there all my life can't get a
Fair spot
Off the top they time off like rare
Clocks

Dayz I prayed when nights were cold
Nowhere to go but still I roll
Too many lights it take it's toll
