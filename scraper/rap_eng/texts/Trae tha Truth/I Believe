It ain't over, it's never gonna be over
And I want you to know you got a angel up there looking down on you
Mamas out of here. Church

[Hook]
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea yea
I Believe, I Believe

[Verse 1] (Trae)
I never thought time would be so close, I can feel it within my reach
My life say church is on the move though it’s minus the one who preach
They say success will bring you pain, I say struggle and bring the same
I used to fight to duck the rain, going through hell like I’m in chains
I truly feel this shit in cycle, like Michael, I’m tryna take flight
The sun don’t shine forever, now I’m like fuck it
Go and give a nigga the night light, hope that I’m focused
Can’t lose my faith and go hopeless, been praying hard, hope God noticed
I’m on my way, I feel God owe this
So close, I can’t blow this, told Niko I’d make her proud
I don’t make it, just know I gave it all that I could, one deep facing this crowd
Yeah, I believe just like my grandfather did ‘fore he passed
They tell me God don’t make mistakes, even the time it passed
I just hope I last to see it, my past been a disaster
Got shot once but I’m still here, my smoke clearing up faster
Yeah, I believe something gone give and won’t nothing get took away
11:59, excuse me, let me pray

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 2] (Big KRIT)
Yeah, I’m not sure I’m supposed to ease my pain
This would be my first confession since I got some change
No, I ain’t been the same, no, I ain’t the same person
How can I shine when all my people hurting?
How can I ride with all these jackals lurking?
How can I say things will be ok when I can’t be for certain?
My momma tell me she prays me for me I hope her prayers are working
I watch the news, look how we do, I’m thinking lord, have mercy
Yeah, I feel victim to the chase of fame and rubber bands
There’s no excuse for what I’ve done, I know you understand
I’ve been a man in situations I should’ve stayed a child
But when you young and people dying, it makes it hard to smile
I’ve done enough in the eyes of man, but that ain’t enough at all
Before I came to You, I searched, but there was no one to call
Yea I lost friends and I’ve lost family in the midst of all this wrath
I'm scared I'll lose my faith and I’m dying to get it back
‘Cause I believe
