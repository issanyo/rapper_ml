[Hook: Future & B.o.B]
How 'bout we hit the club and walk up straight through VIP
How 'bout we get some Puerto Rican girls and Japanese
How 'bout we get some strippers and go crazy with this cheese
How 'bout we pop some bottles and make movies till we G
How 'bout dat, how 'bout dat
How 'bout dat, how 'bout dat
How 'bout dat, how 'bout dat
How 'bout dat, how 'bout dat
How 'bout dat, how 'bout dat
How 'bout dat, how 'bout dat

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
How 'bout dat, look at me like "Bob, why you stuntin' like that?"
Ahhhh, tell 'em blame it on the black Cadilac
I hop out that, haters, hop off that
Pack so strong if you smell it you'll probably catch contact
Freaks, what's up, show a young nigga what it do
Show me what that thing hittin' like and I'll show you how to turn a four-door into a coupe
Gettin' all mad at me cause your girl gettin' loose
Yeah, it ain't no hype, I live that life, what you want me to do?
Well the blue one came out, then the red one came out, now I gotta get two
And my watch ain't got no manners, the shit's just rude
Why you all in my face, you ain't even in my circle dawg, you ain't even in the loop
I'ma wild out till I'm through, how 'bout it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Future]
How 'bout we get the Spikes, how 'bout we get the ice
How 'bout I get a straight girl and I turn that girl to a dyke
How 'bout we go to Magic and Onyx in the same night
How 'bout we get a bunch of ones and let 'em fly like kites
How 'bout I pull up hard, 'Rarri on the front
How 'bout I get the racks and go shopping every day this month
How 'bout I go to Pluto and go crazy with them bands
How 'bout I go to space and never come back ever again
How 'bout we get some bottles, poppin' that Rose
How 'bout we sneak the lean inside the club, it's time to play
How 'bout we make a move, give the streets somethin' to see
How 'bout I flex my watch, you ain't gon' be able to see

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trae the Truth]
All black attire, in my zone
Walk in the club like "guess who home"
King of the city, so well known
Run up trippin', this heat get shown
N -double-ACP, all black stones
Four-time trapper, trappin' all fours
I ball like Diddy, money so long
Tryna pick what chick fi'nna come home
I bet you gon' learn to day, how 'bout that
Walkin' up out of here by myself, I doubt that
Go in hop in that Challenger parked out back
Any wardrobe she in, she hoppin' out that
Old-school game, I ain't never seen foreign, hit the club buck and turn it to a party
Automatic range, where to get started, crews in the back if you run up on me retarded
Bottles gettin' popped, haters get dropped, everything go, nothing can stop
Realest left, only way I rock, I'm the truth, they know that off top
Jealous niggas, yeah they gon' knock, thirsty bitches, yeah they gon' bop
On my dick is pro'bly where they hop, bunch of losers they gon' block
