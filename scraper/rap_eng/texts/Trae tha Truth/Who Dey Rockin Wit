[Intro]
Yeah, like what they fuck they doing, supposed to stop what I'm doing
Ok

[Hook: Trae tha Truth]
Who the fuck you pussy niggas got a problem with
Ask about me in the streets, I'm who dey rockin wit
I heard you hating pussy nigga, you ain't stoppin' shit
All I do is get this money, you ain't blockin' shit
You ain't blockin' shit
You ain't stoppin' shit
I'm who dey rockin wit
Who the fuck you pussy niggas got a problem with

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
What the fuck you niggas thinkin', bitch I run the town
Somebody tell them pussy niggas I was chopper down
Shots fired they can't get your ass up off the ground
It's a celebration bitch come get this other round
They say the streets went kinda quiet bitch you wouldn't loan
I heard the shit ain't been the same, I guess I'm coming home
I guess it's time for me to show you other niggas clones
Fuck with me I cancel your service, I ain't talking phones
And then I'm back to getting money like a bank account
I'm on my hustle nigga fuck what niggas thinkin' 'bout
My respect bitch, it's something you ain't ranking out
I send 'em in a hoop, couple niggas hanging out

[Hook: Trae tha Truth]
Who the fuck you pussy niggas got a problem with
Ask about me in the streets, I'm who dey rockin wit
I heard you hating pussy nigga, you ain't stoppin' shit
All I do is get this money, you ain't blockin' shit
You ain't blockin' shit
You ain't stoppin' shit
I'm who dey rockin wit
Who the fuck you pussy niggas got a problem with

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Niggas got a problem, I got solutions
No security, snatch my chain and I'ma shoot you
A chance of robbing me?, we don't need a judge
All we need is pistols, hollows, point some slugs
All we need is drugs, we don't need a lug
I get millions out the streets what you bring to the table
That's boss talk, that's independence
If she's hella good, way good [?]
I may buy your baby mama a Bentley (skrrr!)
Just to piss you off, take the hoe to [?]
I hate these pussy niggas with a passion
Pussy niggas out of style like some old fashion

[Hook: Trae tha Truth]
Who the fuck you pussy niggas got a problem with
Ask about me in the streets, I'm who dey rockin wit
I heard you hating pussy nigga, you ain't stoppin' shit
All I do is get this money, you ain't blockin' shit
You ain't blockin' shit
You ain't stoppin' shit
I'm who dey rockin wit
Who the fuck you pussy niggas got a problem with

[Outro]
You ain't blockin' shit
You ain't stoppin' shit
I'm who dey rockin wit
Who the fuck you pussy niggas got a problem with
