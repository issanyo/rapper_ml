[Intro: K-Rino]
Who is your master?
Heh Ha
Who made you?
The man who paid you the one who made you?
C'mon
Self Made
I'm self Made

[Verse 1: K-Rino]
No corporate vermin controls the currency that I'm earning
Permanently stay determined to burn em' with every sermon
See my words be up where the birds be verbally free
And undeterred to speak on whatever concepts that serve me
They wanna brain-cuff a king and bring pain and suffering
Any time a angel starts to fly they try to cut it's wings
Look at all these slaves with they fractured arms up and slings
After being vigorously snatched up by the puppet strings
They can't tempt me I'm a turn down whatever they show me
K's the man rebellious slaves that'll never say Toby
Youse a hooker and ya pimp left ya powerless
Telling you how and what to write and how to dress
No more enslavement cause I'm beyond emancipation
Shaped in God's form, by him no other's hands creation
We crack Adams or Leeches who try to track your talents
We leave the children behind and kidnap the parents
The vultures who holding the prophets is outta control
Violence explodes instantly when you try to get bold
Got a big hole that resides in your soul
Forget diamonds and gold you better off sliding down the pole
In a glance you went from twenty-thousand ball parked fans in the stance
To greeting costumers wearing Wal-Mart pants
No man can provoke and rearrange my panel
No governmental remotes can ever change my channel
Because I'm

[Chorus: K-Rino]
Self made, self paid, no chains can hold me
My brain and my body and mind NO powers control me
I'm the self-invented true definition of independent
My vessel is like a fortress fear ain't allowed in it
Cause I'm self made, self paid, no chains can hold me
My brain and my body and mind NO powers control me
I'm the self-invented true definition of independent
My vessel is like a fortress fear ain't allowed in it

[Verse 2: Trae]
Cheyah
Definition of true call between the streets and reality (reality)
(If I'm an untouchable guru?) I'll be damned, I'm a causality (I'm a causality)
It's just a revolution of niggas who just don't give a damn
Never selling they soul or bowing down to catch a couple grand
Last time that I checked I was a man but unlike some of y'all
Never ran from someone who breathe the same, knowing they too can fall
These niggas out here prostituting for radio play
Gay is what that is to let them vanish your freedom away
Freedom of speech, look at what happened with me for speaking out
I still to fight the battle for those in need reaching out (c'mon)
C-community is they veins and the streets is part of they wrist
The truth is within the heart and the soldiers come with the rest
Now I'm riding in this car on the way to face with Collide (I'm ready)
Even if I lose it all get what's inside the trunk can fly
And I bet they'll remember me, one of the only ones who's self made (Trae)
And tell em I said fuck em and they money cause I'm self paid (ha ha)

[Chorus: K-Rino]
Self made, self paid, no chains can hold me
My brain and my body and mind NO powers control me
I'm the self-invented true definition of independent
My vessel is like a fortress fear ain't allowed in it
Cause I'm self made, self paid, no chains can hold me
My brain and my body and mind NO powers control me
I'm the self-invented true definition of independent
My vessel is like a fortress fear ain't allowed in it, uh
