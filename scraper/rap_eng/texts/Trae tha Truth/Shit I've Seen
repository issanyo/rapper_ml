[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Yeah, uh
Half of these muthafuckin' rappers don't know shit
Ain't seen a gangsta, ain't seen a brick
And they wonder why when OGs come around Yelawolf
I get the respect I get
'Cuz I never walked into another man's house
And tell him what I think about the way he lives
I done a lil dirt of my own, and I won't throw stones
So I get back what I give
Reach for the tool, homeboy, go ahead
If you wanna be dead, homie, be dead
Who am I to tell you not to pop a trunk
If you feelin' like a punk
From the he said, she said?
Life's not a choice, it's a win or lose
So what's it gonna be, him or you?
Did he lie on your bed
Is she lyin' to your head
Well
It all depends on the truth
See, I'm realistic (yeah)
And everyday can't be terrific (yeah)
I done seen one of my boys get ticked off
And put his hands on a loaded AK and lifted it
Up in the air, and then we saw him carry it
Into the club, I know he wanted to bury him (hahaha)
My crew was laughin, I was scared as fuck
And they thought it was hilarious
Damn
(Really, thats how y'all do it? Shit)

[Hook: Yelawolf]
The shit I've seen
Has changed me
What used to be strange to me
Just ain't strange to me no more
(Huh, yeah, I done seen this shit before)
It's just another day outside my door
Outside my door
The shit I've seen
Has changed me
What used to be strange to me
Don't stay strange to me no more
(Yelawolf and Trae tha Truth, bitch hit the floor)
It's just another day outside my door
Outside your door

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
Yeah
I let you take a second to introduce you to pain
When everybody goin' through it, they goin' the same
They in they struggle but they focused on makin' they change
If anybody get in the way they makin' it rain
If it go to me, then I probably doin' the same thing
If I ever could I'll forever be reppin' the same game
Rappin' off thinkin' "I promise I'll get the same thing"
In the back of the Maybach or sellin' somebody, mayne
Gettin' brain like I was only here to learn something
When I'm done here trying to earn something
Fuckin' with me I guarantee I'mma return something
Raise some drama then show up and try to burn something
I'll do my dirt and then I never pay it back
I'm dealin' with it and they could never take it back
You can’t respect, the city been awake
Got attacked, got it, I can't hear nobody taking that
You wanna hit the block and I'll thug on anybody dreamin' to get away
And to the love I got for the streets, the hood
Call up any nigga who come that and try to fit in, I send 'em away
Yelawolf, go get the whip, I got this
I open the gate, ain't no way they could stop this
They want it with us, you can tell 'em about this
Lookin' for something pretty, you can tell 'em it's not this

[Hook: Yelawolf]
The shit I've seen
Has changed me
What used to be strange to me
Just ain't strange to me no more
(Huh, yeah, I done seen this shit before)
It's just another day outside my door
Outside my door
The shit I've seen
Has changed me
What used to be strange to me
Don't stay strange to me no more
(Yelawolf and Trae tha Truth, bitch hit the floor)
It's just another day outside my door
Outside your door

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Pray on my god, I believe it's too hard
Don't reach to the dogs who believe the facades
Don't reach too far to compete with the dog
Because deep in the heart, they wanna give you this all
I wish I could be the
One to say I warned you
Don't pay any attention
Man, I wanna ignore the haters
But I can't afford to leave them alone
They say that Yelawolf ain't never been in the dark
In trailer parks, they made their mark
I gotta make it hot, cuz I was given a pardon
I gotta play the role
Serial killin' rappers like I had a serial code
In every city with a cereal bowl
When I rap, peer in to my soul
I'm in the light like a deer in the road
Clear in control, my spirit is old
I'm hearin' the gold, I'm hearin' the foes' hoes
And it falls like a rock
But that don't mean that you hard like one
You want the credit for getting gutter forget it
You muthafuckas pulled out the credit card and run
Street credit won’t put bullets in your gun
But it might put a stray bullet in your son
Daughters, uncles, aunts, friends and loose ends
Becomes tangled up when it comes undone

[Hook: Yelawolf]
The shit I've seen
Has changed me
What used to be strange to me
Just ain't strange to me no more
(Huh, yeah, I done seen this shit before)
It's just another day outside my door
Outside my door
The shit I've seen
Has changed me
What used to be strange to me
Don't stay strange to me no more
(Yelawolf and Trae tha Truth, bitch hit the floor)
It's just another day outside my door
Outside your door
