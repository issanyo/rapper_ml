[Verse 1: Mozzy]
It's really what my life like, killer in the limelight
La-la, dope smoke, tryna get my mind right
'05, poppin' pills, smokin' hella prime time
Bitch mad at me 'cause I never seem to find time
I was rockin' G-Shocks, had to get my ice right
Niggas on the sideline, we do that on shit on eyesight
Me and E cutting up, swanged 'em and he bite like
Every lil' bitch that I be fuckin' kind of right, right
I really live a trife life, got to keep a pipe life
Please don't let him catch you without it or its night-night
Used to call him Izod, but now they call him Mozzy
All you got to do is drop five or call me for that body
Abuse him with the jumper, The Gleeker, he hold Scotty
It looked like I was tagging him, I don't know if I got him
(It looked like I was tagging him, I don't know if I got him)

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
D-Block
Yeah, they say it take a real man to admit error
It's gon' take a long time 'fore it gets better
You know me, I'm from the food stamp, WIC era
The four-door five series with the Anteras
There's a lot of things in life that you can't cherish
When the haters in the light, then you can't flourish (Nah)
Can't sleep good at night 'til your mans perish (Yup)
Couple funerals will always give a man leverage
Yeah, if it don't make you perspire, you can't sweat it
Arm strong, dice on fire, you can't bet it
A pastime is chess boards and calisthenics
Love seein' coroner vans and paramedics
The best to those that befriended me (The best)
Even success to all my enemies (Yes)
Permanent scars so you remember me
This is a real nigga assembly

[Verse 3: Trae the Truth]
Yeah, check it
Imitatin' blow had me traffickin' out that stole-o
Seven days straight, clothes lookin' like I'ma hobo
I was movin' solo, two choppers off in the four-door
Might put a few through your chest, make 'em stitch it up like a logo
Run up in the spot, niggas freezin' up like a photo
Go to playin' tough, he ain't work 'em like I was Kodo
I used to sit the bench, they ain't picture me going pro though
Now I pulled up on the block throwin' bullets like Tony Romo
Money somewhere pilin' up, now I'm on that fuck 'em shit
Solid so I'm standing up, nigga, I ain't duckin' shit
I was in the kitchen with it, Tom was trying to cop a brick
Homies say the price is right, play and I'ma pop the stick
Let it be a issue, home, do no talkin', who harder?
Finna' get him soft and find his body floatin' with a dolphin, no coffin
Focus the damage and clean your block like a janitor
Bitch, you gon' get this work, hit your corner, run 'em like scavengers
Probably flight it to Canada, packages come from Panama
I've been workin' this shit out for 'bout a week, check my stamina
Play me out, respect, I'ma pull up and get your [?], second guess
I had 'em paramedics pumpin' your chest
Stupid ass

[Verse 4: Dave East]
For that check, I'ma catch a body
I caught him in his lobby on the run for three months
I'ma accomplice to a homi'
I got a call from Mozzy, drive-bys on Ducatis
Trae know I'm the truth, a nigga dyin' if he try me
I'm with sliders and they grimy
He ain't had no key, I caught him tryna to buzz in the buildin'
Taking too long, got him (Got him)
All my moves is Mafia, a descendant of Gotti (Gotti)
You tryna to box like Rocky, you'll be in the box, you copy? (Copy)
Mami like, "Ooh, Papi, go down on me sloppy"
You bootleg niggas got your style from the swap meet
I be doin' meet and greets, pistol clothes
Tell Chi Chi to get the coke
In real life, you niggas broke, Tyga with the Bocce
Eyes lookin' Asian, so fuck it, we order saké
Shrimp fried rice, so it was either beef or broccoli (Either or)
Real life, I'm with killers, I know they momma though
Stick on my body when drama close, vámonos

[Verse 5: E Mozzy]
Even when it's storm headed straight to the money
'Cause I don't go get it, nobody gon' bring it to me
Pussy caught me leakin', nigga tried to bring it to me
If you ain't gonna fly, watch how I bring it to 'em
No Whiskey with the shot, you won't even see it comin'
Do the whole dance on your ass, see me comin'
Bad bitch double back with the trap, all hunnids
Show her how to ball now she sayin' that she love me
Keep somethin' on me 'cause shit can get ugly
Money in my pocket, I put it on your skully
Pull-up doin' hop-outs in the buggy
Couples niggas got hit, Lord knows they got lucky

[Outro: E Mozzy]
Lord knows they got lucky
Couples niggas got hit, Lord knows they got lucky
Lord knows they got lucky
Couples niggas got hit, Lord knows they got lucky
