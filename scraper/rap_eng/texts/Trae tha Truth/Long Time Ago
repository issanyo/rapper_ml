[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
It ain’t no game, when I rip it I rip it for the south
I’m in the sixty where these niggas’ll run in your house
They get that money, do they best just to run in your spouse
Late night, call it murder, they taking it out
Diamonds in the safe, got plenty more in my mouth
I’m in the kitchen cooking hard but I’m playing with soft
Pussy niggas [?], I’m here for the south
I’m only talking horsepower, you see the exhaust
Any time you see me movin’ I’ma swing on ‘em
I got the city on vibe, they gon’ flame on ‘em
I’m here to hurt a hater’s feelings nigga, pain on ‘em
I remember who I am, I never change on ‘em
ABN, gang gang, nigga checks up
Fuck niggas playin’ foul I’ma take somethin’
I tried to tell ‘em it was easy, I’ma break somethin’
Chain on, I’ma make they ass respect somethin’

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Catching plays in that four story loft
Broke nigga why you talkin’, where your boss?
Gimme everything, I don’t take a loss
Play with me and I’ma send ‘em through your mouth
Eight chains on like I’m in the chain gang
Lil breadwinner T on the same thing
Got me feeling so fly, I’m on the same plane
I know my niggas on lock, tryna maintain
I’ma hit ‘em with a [?], money on the books
All I ever knew was killers and a bunch of crooks
Got a thousand pounds of green and a bunch of books
They for the gram, I ain’t talking ‘bout a bunch of books
Still keep that money like Big Jew
Four cars full of niggas, what that shit do?
Late night, [?], still come through
This screwed up shit, ain’t nothin’ new

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Been gone, we had a real strong demo
Rap crew wasn’t [?] these, new rental
A nigga really got it, no trappin’, no cappin’
Bust a [?] homi, and it saved my package
Got an attitude problem and I’m real big-headed
Bring another bitch to fulfill this fetish
Man I know a lot of niggas wanna kill this
Still this shit that I’m kicking is the real [?]
Never gave two fucks, nigga stayed booed up
Nigga you ain’t drinkin’ lean, it don’t take two cups
You never comin’ with the money, want a date, booked up
They would shake down a nigga but they ain’t shook up
Not fakin’ now nigga, bitch you can’t fool us
Triple OG cool with the new-schoolers
Me and [?] shooting pool, motherfucking fool
Tell a bitch you ain’t shit if you ain’t get screwed up
