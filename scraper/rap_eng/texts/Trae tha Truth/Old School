[Intro: Baby Houston & Trae tha Truth]
Daddy, I wanna ride in that old school today
You wanna ride in that old school, what you wanna ride in that fo'?
I'm tryna get this money, man
Oh, yeah? What you know about getting money?
See you're gonna be a problem just like your older brother, fool
I ain't mad at you though, sun is hot, huh?
Guess I might as well shine on a few today
Aight man, come on!
Where my keys at?

[Verse 1: Trae]
I gotta hit this corner homie
Real anticipation
Shit i was getting money
A couple nigga hating
A couple bitches waiting too
Tell them to pick a number
Look like laguna,kinda hard to keep them getting under
I'm in my old school,swingin like i'm stevie wonder
They say my wrist don't make sense ,i call them dumb and dumber
I track your feel through half these women call me trae the runner
I keep a shooter riding with that oklahoma thunder
When he done he switch up cities like if he james harding
You about that wood? i like to beg your motherfucking pardon
You better find someone to play with
I'm in my old school coolin nigga
Better not say shit

[Hook 1: Trae tha Truth]
Hit the block homie,shine on them like lights
Let the ceiling take flight (in my old school)
Beat the trunk on them
Let the 4's poke out so fuck niggas be about (in my old school)
A couple women with with me, ain't hard to see what they about
So much ass they can't get out (in my old school)
It ain't no point of flexing
I grab my 6 and money until my hustle run out
(in my old school)


[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
Keep more wood than a cabin
Nigga what really happen?
Paint hard as fuck,leather soft as a napkin
Yeah the truth leaning corners like it's purple rain
I'm moving slow with somthing floating on them purple planes
Body thick as hell,picture in the perfect frame
Lord knows i only seen her ass,i never heard her name
The black stayed up,terrific king like the national champ
Real nigga exercizing till i catch a cramp
Slow loud and banging when i'm itching the other chick to stand
Fore i pull my rank and send the word to rearrange the camp
Im in my old school,this whip cold fool
Earthquake,i have it beatin through your soul fool

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2: Snoop Dogg]
Brown cadillac,white chevrolet
All day every day (in my old school)
Candy paint dripping,man i ain't ever slipping
Yeah i'm 20 cripping (in my old school)
I keep my music loud
As i move the crowd
With the windows down
Banging that motown
Blowing the dogg pound
They tell me "slow down"
(In my old school)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Times wasting ,i'm going to go get it
Drop the top,lifting out cities
Squat it, got it, feeling good
Rolling around my neighborhood
Bossing up,tossing up cash
Glass house ,ass drag
Go to the store and get me one more
Low riders, three or four
Cali chronic is all that we blow
Trae the truth right from the intro
So when you get down to your last few dollars
Really wanna sell it but you don't wanna holler
Laid laid back back
Lean lean to the side
AC blowing,now you know it
How we rolling on the west side

[Hook 2]
