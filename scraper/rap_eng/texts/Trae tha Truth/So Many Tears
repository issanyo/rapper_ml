[Intro]
Holiday Season
As I fear no one but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I [?]
If I should die before I wake, please God walk with me
Take a nigga to heaven, for real

[Verse 1]
Back in elementary I couldn’t dodge Misery
I was alone pain ever been a friend to me
Looking back I only thought about me staying the back
Rolled off with the shit got a K in the back
I was taught send them at yo face never your back
Niggas better salute the truth never play em for whack
Feel like i’m sinking i was stuck in the rain
Can’t change voices in ma head yelling ma name
This dreams was all in ma mental nothing was gentle
Swiss here tryna stay on track no instrumental
All they ever got was bad news brother in the cell doing mandatory life
Tell the judge go to hell i’m in guerilla no never take no nights off
All they do is rap, thuggin till they lights off
If i could stop em fuck it I would and i’m ridin with em
And if it’s really against the will fuck it i’m ridin with em

[Hook]
Father forgive me for they say nothing’s promised to kids like us
I get it Lord I suffer through the years, I shed so many tears
What’s funny is, they say stress can be the best friend of so many tears
I say fuck em both Lord I suffer through the years, I shed so many tears

[Verse 2]
I ain’t a killer but I did what you niggas done push me
I got a chopper yeah let’s fuck em come play me for pussy
Am I insane how I think about merking the devil
Father forgive me for my sis I stay with this [?]
I’m seeing homicide baby too many get murdered
And I don’t know who coming for me they ain’t tryna get murdered
And I ain’t tryna see the penitentiary ma nigga brother missing for a century (fucked up)
Ain’t had luck since I left out ma momma
And I ain’t had peace so i’m playing with drama
Ain’t no one hunnid with the truth better add em a comma
I’m here to terrorise a nigga bin laden osama
I feel ma vision kinda blurry I owed niggas revenge
I’m tryna see it in a hurry

[Hook]
Father forgive me for they say nothing’s promised to kids like us
I get it Lord I suffer through the years, I shed so many tears
What’s funny is, they say stress can be the best friend of so many tears
I say fuck em both Lord I suffer through the years, I shed so many tears
