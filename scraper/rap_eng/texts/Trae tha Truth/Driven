[Hook: Poo Bear MDMA] x2
Trying hard to speak and fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction, so part of the plan
When something is broken and you try to fix it
Trying to repair it any way you can

[Verse 1: Trae]
Everything wrong, I feel like a nigga crashin'
Knowing I gotta make it no matter whatever happens
Now they know where to go it's like everything a distraction
What the fuck I'm gonna do is what everyone keep asking
Looking at the news got me sick of seeing my face
Every time I hit the block I'm sick of catching the case
I'm tryna get it together but everything outta place
As soon as I get a break it's like everything go to waste
[?] you would swear that I was goin' crazy
Probly [?] but I'm fightin' for my babies
Fightin with the one muthafucking hand I got
I'm able to block you I swear it's something amazing
The greatest, yea you can tell them that I'm the greatest
You looking for a king, tell them that I'm the latest
One of the realest ever to do it from the heart
So it'll probly be a minute before somebody can fade this
Still tryna find the way I can get to the top
I'm fear they tryna find the way, they can't get me to stop
I know it's probly only there cause they feel like I'm hot
I'm here to make the best of it leavin' niggas a shot
It's my time, but you already know though
Too many people hatin' so I'd rather do it solo
Soon as I get a break they wanna take it like a photo
Even if I don't get it fast, I'mma get it slow mo
Yea I'mma get it slow mo
You never know though
But I'mma stand strong
And let the wind blow
I know shit changed
It's all good though
I ain't left yet
I know how this shit go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Shit ain't cool, shit ain't fair
What a nigga gotta do to try and get up there?
Scared by they air but they ain't sharing
Must we Tuskegee Airmen
Everytime they get a hair in?
Get a chair but tables turn
A hundred miles in the hairpin
You get a seat, they say get a suit
Cause they won't see you if you don't wear them
Invisible man go to war with a suit
[?], cause we scare them
Gangsta enough to flip the table over
But got the manners to then push the chair in
Niggas wanna be on thrones
But all the power's with the chairmen
I just wanna be in my zone
Cause a nigga don't care then
Word to God, he made me bright
Word to God, man he gave me breath
Police out here tryna give you life
Streets out here tryna give you death
Energy tryna give me strength
Enemies tryna give me stress
R.I.P. that nigga Clip
ABN, F 'N F
