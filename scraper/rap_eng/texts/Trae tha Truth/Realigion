[Hook: Dej Loaf]
I remember when I get my knees like every night, every night
[?] problem I had every day, every day
I know I ain't crazy, I got my mind
I know what I believe, nigga I'm a G
So, real is my religion
Stay silent with my niggas, never put 'em under bitches
Now real is my religion
Getting money, handle business
Real is my religion

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
I thank god for waking me up today
Nothin' about it promised, I'll live it till its taken away
It might happen quicker for the ones who can't make it away so regardless let me pray
Way too many out aimin' for Trae
Even those I love
But I won't kick it how they kick it, they too different n im something solid
D-Kee? raised me to be stiff, them niggas too fly in need of a pilot
If they ain't trippin over money, they out here trippin out over hoes
I never put any of that before my people, even tho they heart was froze, Hate was chose
I used to be 1000
Now im tryin to multiply it twice
Loyalty is mandatory, never switch it for a price
Niggas snakes in broad day, no hidin', they can walk now
I just judge em by they actions
They all confusion when they talk now

I am not crazy, if I do it  know its for a reason
Shit if I speak it, then respect it, this is real nigga season
At least for me
I'm trying to bring it back around
I know I owe that fo the ones that ain't around...

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
The devil thinkin bout ways he can work ya, they say that hatin can hurt ya
You thinkin its love but homie waitin on a day he can merc ya
Jealousy and Envy nothin healthy, dont let it convert ya
Find yourself in hell alone
Where no one can save ya or church ya
Moving back in time thinkin about what could be
I'm doin this shit i do for him, this shit ain't nothin to me
Off in these streets, im that gospel- Pay attention
I can show you what was real and what was not- just pay attention
The way I live my life, they lookin at me like im a crime
Is it because I speak the truth and everyone of em lyin?
Look even closer, a better flaw in me you ain't gon find
Bein real is my religion until they bury me somewhere within the ground
But for now im out here hustlin
Watchin me, what they must have been
Tryna crucify me the same time these niggas were rushin in
Some people was family but didn't handle me like we was kin
I told em once they leave up out my presence they best not come again...
