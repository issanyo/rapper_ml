[Hook]
Mama
I gotta hit the truck
Bump another day
Wanna walk away
But trust me
It’s gonna be okay
And, baby, yeah
I know that I’ll be strapped up everyday
It’s a part of the game
But trust me
I’mma be okay
Just give me one more day
Just one more
(Day)
One more day
Give me one more day
That’s all I need
One more, yeah

[Verse 1]
(Give me one more day)
Ain’t nothin’ promised to make it
Mama, no need to panic
I’m tryin’ to get to the money
The struggle is cinematic
I just need 24 hours
Tryin’ to finish what I started
Conversin’ with these half nuts
City of broken hearted
At times you say I’m dead wrong
I’m just tryin’ to get that house for ya
I remember days ahead
Then nothin’
I’m gonna work it out for ya
(Work it out for ya)
I’ve never been a loser
I’m just tryin’ to provide
I heard the road got kinda rough
I’m just here for the ride
(Uh)
This pistol loaded
Only ‘cause these n*****
Broke and jealous
S***, I was broke as hell
Just sussin’ for a fortune tellers
Never depend on what these n***** do
Do yourself, and I been doin’ me
Around the clock like it was nothin’ else
This money comin’
Like a rumor full of bad news
I gotta get it
While I’m still holdin’ my last spoons
(Last spoons)
Ain’t no losin’ my mind
Even if I’m losin’ mine
I’m out tellin’ it
As we speak
No point in losin’ time

Mama

I’mma be okay
Just give me one more day
Just one more
(Day)
One more day
Give me one more day
That’s all I need
Give me one more day

[Verse 2]
I’m searchin’ for better days
Tryin’ to get back on track
Watch over my kids for me
In case I don’t make it back
I knew it’d be hard to sleep
Pray we goin’ make it through it
You say you want somethin’ greater
One day I’mma take you to it
Lost in the city
Takin’ precaution
Haters on radar
(Radar)
I know I ain’t exempt
Slippers count
That’s why I stay far
I don’t plan on
Lettin’ ‘em get the best of me
Not today
Fight her ‘til it’s over
On everything, I’mma make her wait
(Yeah)
Somebody goin’ give me this
I feel like I’m built to get it
Nobody mess this up
We make it
Then I’m goin’ quit it
I know my brother doin’ life
That’s your oldest son
And Lowry died when I was young
That’s the coldest one
(Coldest one)
Gimme a pass
I gotta handle what
I came to do
This one for the family
But on top of that
It’s me and you
You told me have a plan
And, sis, I do
I gotta see it through
Mama, please forgive me
For everything
I pray you do

(Day)
One more day

That’s all I need
One more, yeah

[Verse 3]
Listen, please forgive me
I know I said it would be different
But I get up out that prison
I would never start back up trippin’
Never
And I mean it
On my kids, I was with it
Many tried, but I swear
My pride died last Christmas
She ain’t even bought a tree
Bought no m*****f*****’ presents
No, my kids special
They deserve to get whatever
(Babies)
Yeah, all that pressure
I had to go through what I know
Once I get us out this [?]
I won’t do this s*** no more, baby
(Uh)
You and mama stop stressin’
And just trust me
I’mma be okay
I’m a veteran
This nothin’
Soon as we get a plate
I swear to God I’ll quit hustlin’
S***, I gotta do somethin’
Pray for me

[Hook]
Mama (please)
I gotta hit the truck
Bump another day
I wanna walk away
But trust me
It’s gonna be okay
And, baby, yeah
I know that I’ll be strapped up everyday
It’s a part of the game
But trust me
I’mma be okay
Just give me one more day
Just one more
One more day
Give me one more day
That’s all I need
One more, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
