Sipping on grape- no Fanta
Member bein broke- no Fan to
Come around and say we got it
So we made it. not an option
Put the PH in the prophet
Interception- Pickin’ Pockets
Interception- Pickin' Pockets
Stay collecting big deposits
Harden up, you know we rock hits, (Rockets)

[Verse 1 - PH4DE]
Put a few bars in the trap
Welcome to the part of the map
Where the hardest to clap
Get farthest, in fact
Yeh we 'Slang beats,' Put hearts in a sack
And it started wit crack
Whippin with the wrist drip
I
Kept my chest-out, like a nip slip
My
Pet snake said I wouldn’t get shit
Get this
Bitch see me now, and he wanna throw a 'Miss-Fit,'
Lies
Never gonn keep PH4DE down
Tesla powered, so I never PH4DE out
Flex your towers, I could wreck in hours
Better check this coward, hes too-paid out, (toupee)
Ay
Double Entrendre the flow
Ay
Put me on top of the boat
Ay
Tell her to swallow some mo'
"How many liters you got in your throat?"
Ay
She ain’t really fuckin with the nonsense
Constant Top Shit, she be on God shit
Spotless, too clean, flow sound polished
Panties all 'round-house', I been on a 'drop kick,'
Told her the flow gonn save her
She really wanna meet Trae First
Wanna do anal outside?
That’s fine, You can be our Asshole, By Nature. Ay

[Verse 2 - Trae Tha Truth]
It ain't many niggas fuckin with what i do when I spit
I pull up on 'em, they rapid fire, lookin' to make a hit
I pull up bangin the hammer, knowin that shit legit
Ima blap blap blap - unload it til it quit
I'm the type of contender won't leave til i'm a winner
Bet you niggas remember
Eat up niggas for dinner
I'm as cold as the winter
I'm tha truth remember
I am not a beginner just focused like an antennae 
Niggas talkin like I was a topic
Soon as I hit the block
I pull out that chopper- they stop it
Truth is a red nose
Pick em a target and lock it
Bitch it was going down
Then when you niggas did not get
Anything I was in
Tell them Tha Truth is official
Young niggas for war sent out like they was a missile
Tell em they tryin to hit something then make it fa shizzle
And if it wasn't nothin they finish and get a utensil-
Stick something
What the fuck up, Don't fuck yo luck up
This late night mac shit, Your face get touched up
I'm ready to smoke something, Like something you puff up
Your blocc get lightened up, Conceded, stuck up
Hold the fuck up-
Look nigga
When it come to beef I be lookin to cook nigga
Reenact mobb deep you shook nigga
I'm the champ, any title get took nigga
Michael jordan, jackson, tyson nigga
Get the cake like fuck the icing nigga
Trae is flawless, nothin nicer nigga
World is mine, dont need to price it nigga
Roll the dice and play with your life
Soon as you crap, I was coming like a thief in the night
No one can stop what Ima do, Ima do what I like
Rep for T E X A S for life nigga
