[Intro]
There is a Houston rapper who is taking um, a more hands on approach to his fellow Harvey victims, Trae tha Truth
Joined the growing list of volunteer rescuers after he was uh, rescued from his own home
One of the many reasons he has been honored, uh, by his home town for a decade now
There's actually a Trae day in Houston on July 22nd for his humanitarian work for this great Texas city
So Trae tha Truth is with me now, from the Convention Centre, and, and Trae...

[Verse 1]
So went down on my knees, I make a call to God like he the last one left
It's kinda hard to get through it, I'm still yellin' for help, it's like the whole world deaf
And though I'm tryna see through it, I'm feelin' life is miserable, ain't no point in even tryin'
They say it could have been worse and it'll prolly never get better watchin' the blind lead blind
You never know your position until it got use
Yeah, I know it ain't nothin' perfect about truth
I had this pain on lock, somehow it got loose
It's like we been through hell, somehow we got through
Watchin' the rain so hard, like, "What we gon' do?"
The sky was black, the rain was pourin'
Devastation, wind was blowin'
Water risin', overflowin'
The cried for help, and Lord, I'm goin'
I gotta do my best
Both feet in, water to my chest
Whole neighborhood's gone
Bein' able to do but wanna tell 'em it's okay
But I know it's amiss, I can't lie to 'em
I'm holdin' only, in a way, I was sayin' goodbye to 'em
A rescuse team in the sky, hopin' to fly to 'em
Yeah, they gon' get saved but don't apply to 'em
They really hurt 'cause all they can do is cry to 'em

[Verse 2]
The body count was risin', family members missin', others tryna survive
They all know the condition but yet, they help the alive
They need help 'cause they feel like they ain't gon' make it inside
Feelin' everythin' go, some was battlin' pride
They on they last leg
Everything was lost, help denied
Shelters closin', now they back outside
Home is gone, there ain't nowhere to go
Survival mode, it's go for what you know
Life is real, so now we on our own
Government was thrown and they was wrong
These circumstances, they really don't belong
Few denied, I told 'em I'd get 'em a loan
Bunch of people take advantage of the situation
Got the money and collect it with no hesitation
Put they face up in the camera like they here to help
Nod to the people, then they loosen with the frustration
What about the ones that hit rock bottom?
And the kids who traumatized by poverty?
It ain't the truth if I tell you they ain't a part of me
Ain't nothin' close when you feel like when you got so far to be
One thing for sure, I'm here to fight for 'em
Do right for 'em, tryna save life for 'em
Everybody need help but they need hope
Hopin' one day God'll end up bein' a light for 'em

[Verse 3]
Think of the survivors dedicated to front lines
Times they came and times they went
We sacrifice our life, countless how we spent
Children sleepin' on floors, some sleepin' in tents
Our faces covered in tasks, can't take the scent
Movin' on imposed days, only get worse
So many cries, swear to God you wanna get a nurse
We only wanna see us make it to a better day
Told 'em the love unconditional for what it's worth
Over 500 mill', why the city hurtin'?
Trae tha Truth, or Mr. Rogers, only people workin'
Our boots to the ground, gettin' holes in 'em
Heard people talkin' but their answers said they weren't certain
I gotta fight, I don't agree with how they doin' us
They say the city back to normal, that was new to us
I told a bunch of kids I got 'em for the holiday
A mansion, witnessin' less than a toothbrush
I feel like I wanna punch through a wall
I know a lot of people need this so I'm standin' up tall
Before they can fall
Relief ain't gon' last so they call
They helpin' the system, no matter if we riskin' or not
Although it's dark, tell 'em, "We are one"
It ain't never gon' be over until we are done
I know that one day we gon' see our sun
If there's any type of pressure, tell 'em, "We don't run"
