[Intro]
Loaded, she crazy, feel me, only real niggas gon’ understand this one Not like you app niggas, tho. Listen

[Hook]
I had a dream and it was hard for me to sleep on it
The feds hit my nigga house, I had to leave only
I neva thought this life I lead I had to leave homie
Even lost some close friends thanks to greed, homie
I had a dream and it was hard for me to sleep on it
My bitch hit the stairs, even started creepin’ on me
Fuck it, I know she love the way I’m livin’
I guess that’s the thanks I get for givin’
I had a dream

[Verse: Compton Menace]
Wakin’ about that dream in the cold sweat
Smoke this shit that’s in my ashtray
Here about that last day, and all the niggas that I trusted
Splitted up all that paper, Know this livin’, they love it
My niggas know to plea the fifth If they eva came
I don’t know shit I don’t know who to blame
Ain’t got shit to say, yo, where my lawyer at?
He-a fuckin’ Jew he-a eat the case
I be in about this loyalty What do it really mean?
I give these niggas eat, that’s how you make a team
It don’t make my ? no, these niggas don’t know me
Me and my niggas chosen, chasin these gloves ?
I had a dream about it, woke up, I had to think about it
Cold sweat, sip of Hennessy, I had to drink about it
Think I saw a ? like I couldn’t think about it
And I’m in that 6-4. bloint, think about it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Wakin’ up pacin’, everything is so strange
Everything distant, shit was outta my range
I had a dream and inside encrypted was in jello written my name(?)
Told me he’d stand by my side, ain’t nuttin’ change, I miss my nigga
Reality say that time can heal the worst of wounds
So for now I’m in the saddles with the worst of goons
Some say I’m doomed, but shit, I disagree and keep it movin’
Payn close attention to what I’m doin’
Can’t get caught slippin’, dippin’ Seconds from trippin’ in traffic ,Tryna find the way, they told me God had light focused on me, Hope it shine today (hope it shine today)
Our dreams ain’t pleasant, some of them nightmares ?
Me, make it tryna fix it, then why would I care

[Hook]
