[Intro]
Look at my ticks
Look at my tick
Look at my tick
Look at my tick (in the work)

[Hook]
Where was you when I was putting in that work (in the work)
Trying to get it all like it ain’t enough (in the work)
Now I’m getting everything I deserve (in the work)
Where was you when I was putting in that work (in the work)
Where was you when I was putting in that work (in the work)
Where was you when I was putting in that work (in the work)
Now I’m getting everything I deserve (in the work)
Where was you when I was putting in that work

[Verse 1]
I got this tick on me
I used to be broke
Remember you set it on me
Not no more
N*gga don’t fuck with mine
N*gga don’t fuck with mine
All these diamonds on me
Got me so cold
N*gga my money to buy
Your money too low
Don’t come my way
Don’t come my way (in the work)

[Hook]
Where was you when I was putting in that work (in the work)
Trying to get it all like it ain’t enough (in the work)
Now I’m getting everything I deserve (in the work)
Where was you when I was putting in that work (in the work)
Where was you when I was putting in that work (in the work)
Where was you when I was putting in that work (in the work)
Now I’m getting everything I deserve
Where was you when I was putting in that work (in the work)

[Verse 2]
Yeah all these rips and these hoes they sending me
N*gga you ain’t a friend to me
Ain’t no point to pretend to be
This money that I got I ain’t get for free
Your fake diamonds are offending me
You better get up out my face
I’m quick to trip
[?]
Yeah I’m a fool with it
I was running through the H with a few hoes
[?] these new foes
On the way to King John with a few chains
When I pull up to the shop those get froze
N*gga I don’t even fuck with the bank
Hustle like folk with your bank
Diamonds so clear they was blank
I go and get it no limit like I am a [?]
I get this money to blow it
Don’t nothing come before it
I see the hate they showed it
To them haters I’m reloading
Hey hey hey hey oooh

[Hook]
Where was you when I was putting in that work (in the work)
Trying to get it all like it ain’t enough
Now I’m getting everything I deserve
Where was you when I was putting in that work (in the work)
Where was you when I was putting in that work (in the work)
Where was you when I was putting in that work (in the work)
Now I’m getting everything I deserve
Where was you when I was putting in that work (in the work)
