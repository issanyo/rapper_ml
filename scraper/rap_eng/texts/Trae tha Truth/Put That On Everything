[Hook - Ebony Love]
Took a lifetime to get here
One footstep in the streets, no fear
Haters tryin' to keep 'em down but they won't let 'em
When they die they go same once they go get 'em
Put that on everything
I know, I know (if I put it down)
I know, I know (you can plug it out)
I know, I know (you can make it now)
I know, put that on everything

[Verse 1 - 8Ball]
Put it down leave a nigga stranded in the gutter
Everything I got I got it with my own hustle
If you can see the future tell me, am I still here?
My real niggers rolling with me like a wheel chair
My girl tell me: you've been working hard take a break
The world tell me: you a chef, nigga cook the cake
My plan was to be the greatest poet ever born
Speak for the real niggers, be a loud voice for 'em
My history long, nigga go and Google 8Ball
I tell stories from my life when I write songs
Not the greatest influence for growing little kids
Mama raised me good, this is what the streets did
Heaven waitin' on me I got too much shit to do
Never end the hustle pimpin', I am never through
Never over, never finished long as I'm breathin'
Long as I'm breathin', you better believe it

I know, I know (you can plug it out)
I know, I know (you can make it now)
I know, put that on everything

[Verse 2 - Styles P]
All I know is dope dealers and go gooders
Pretty cars and bikes and big four -wheelers
Fast money and fast women, the fast lane
All I know what it to do when the cash came
Everybody in the game know my last name
Styles dash PS put sunshine and black in
Right time to get here, hunt for what's in the streets
Hustlin', makin' sure to hook the peeps
In street John salute my nigga 8Ball
8 minutes, I could move 88 8 balls
5 late, trade 8's in the face y'all
We can move it all, from the brick to the shift y'all
Soon as the seal, soon as the deal take off
Meet me outside, not taking the brick y'all
Took a lifetime to get here, hustlin', studio
Lifetime to get here

[Verse 3 - Trae The Truth]
Young raise on the drop bitch I'm still slide
Broke hoes on nuts, and this deal hide yea
Trunk set, dipping on the fifth steel glide
I live and die for the streets, bitch I'm still ridin'
I remember bein' broke like a piece of glass
Yet those I love the most got rid of me like I was trash
They never came back to get me so I was on my own
And made my name like somewhat of a king, I was on my throne
Yea glare heels plus water nigga spit nails
But if you don't say the same, I beat your ass and get to hearin'
Sounded as a rock, spit I say you'd better fear it
My stand is like a wall, take a take for you to clear it
That mean it ain't comin' through, ain't no comin' round
Ain't no comin' down but I rat your ass about a time
Black Superman still in the heart of the gutter
I came through shit without the streets, tell the bitch I love 'er
