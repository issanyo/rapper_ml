[Intro: Trae Tha Truth & R. Kelly]
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
But I'm not gon' quit (But I'm not gon' quit)
I've come too far (I've come too far)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
But I'm not gon' quit (But I'm not gon' quit)
I've come too far
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
Forgive me Lord
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
For any sins I've been committing in the past
But I'm not gon' quit (But I'm not gon' quit)
I've come too far (I've come too far)
Or any sins I may commit in the near future
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
Did I do a X1-3?
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
Praise your name and I thank You
But I'm not gon' quit (But I'm not gon' quit)
Give me the strength, let me tell them my truth
I've come too far (I've come too far)

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
It's a new year but drama got me stressing again
So I'm feelin' like I'm barely missing my blessings again
Say a prayer, then I load my smith & wesson again
It ain't no tellin' when these niggas gon be flexin' again
From all the mist that I was in they said I'd end up in the grave
I would end up in 8 buck tent for the rest of my days
If they coming I ain't, runnin' the ghetto is where I stay
Real nigga, find me up in the gutter, that's full of strays
See the acoustic is to have me feelin' I'm out of time
And I might tell you something wrong but I'd tell you ain't nothing fine
If I was anybody else but The Truth I'd probly be cryin'
Yea the talent of the paper, if I found out he wouldn't mind
Man I look like I'm a make it but fuck it I'm gonna be tryin'
Niggas say I'm out of line but I say I'm out of my mind
Niggas betrayed or be dyin', but I give it to you â€“ they lyin'
Watchin' niggas come around and hopin' not givin' them shine
I'm gettin' sick of this shit

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
But I'm not gon' quit (But I'm not gon' quit)
I've come too far (I've come too far)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
But I'm not gon' quit (But I'm not gon' quit)
I've come too far (I've come too far)

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Every time I look around I'm seeing shit more worse
I ain't heaven or blessed to look at, I just got cursed
I go to trippin' when I think that I'll be put in a hearse
Then I wonder why didn't they come and get the fake niggas first
The way I'm feelin' got me lookin' for a permanent nurse
That's why I put Maggie Priscilla what I feel in a verse
Everything I did was real, I ain't never had to rehearse
So tell them niggas who is or get the fuck off my turf
Yella my bang, so go and get a seat and relax
ABN GANG, I'm 'bout to pull up in packs
And I f I tell you I'm the realest I'm just statin' a fact
I guarantee I got the reality from roaches and rats
The Truth is here, them other think you niggas is gone
You may just lost it, wonderin' like the signal on my phone
Standin' alone, you pussy niggas know what I'm on
I make the first nigga who's talkin' reevaluate his tone
I'm gettin' sick of this shit

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
But I'm not gon' quit (But I'm not gon' quit)
I've come too far (I've come too far)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
But I'm not gon' quit (But I'm not gon' quit)
I've come too far (I've come too far)

[Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]
Take a look at the niggas I thought I was cool with
2000 and 20, niggas you be on that new shit
The feel like I offs in but I don't owe niggas nothin' but never
Think it's like fuckin' my bitch, they won't do shit
I get out of my shoes, I'll introduce you the whole time
Dissin' when I speak, I'll introduce you the whole rhyme
Thinkin' about people around me that got took away
I'm a thousand miles already and I won't stop 'til I fall down
Pressure, probly just enough to make you lose it
Cause the reel in my seat, praying I don't have to use it
Only fear God, nothing else and don't confuse it
Loyalty ain't the same, fuck niggas gon abuse this
Sick of their lies, sick of their crimes, sick of this pain
Sick of this rain, how fake are these niggas speakin' my name?
Shit ain't the same, been that way since I got bigger with fame
I'm a hold my head high and never hold it in shame
Bitch, I'm sick of this shit

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
But I'm not gon' quit (But I'm not gon' quit)
I've come too far (I've come too far)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
But I'm not gon' quit (But I'm not gon' quit)
I've come too far (I've come too far)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
But I'm not gon' quit (But I'm not gon' quit)
I've come too far (I've come too far)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
But I'm not gon' quit (But I'm not gon' quit)
I've come too far (I've come too far)
