My homie lend me some cash, thank you
Bartender filled my glass, thank you
Took a drug test and I passed, thank you
Pretty girls giving me that ass, and all I can say is
Thank you
Thank you
Hold up, can I get 10 feet
Without a drunk bitch steppin' on me?
Or at least get a minute we can chill for
While I command them and be a boss, thank you
I'm like Anna Winner, 3 shots deep no sleep or dinner
Sinning, so luxurious, it's enough to make a man curious
Oh, keep up with my flow
I can teach you how to play, I can teach you how to play
Oh, keep up with my flow
I can teach you how to play, I can teach you how to play
My homie lend me some cash, thank you
Bartender filled my glass, thank you
Took a drug test and I passed, thank you
Pretty girls giving me that ass, and all I can say is
Thank you!
Thank you
DEV EV EV, my ID is on my key
And even in my sweat clothes
I burn these hoes like a blank CD
You want pot, drink a sprite
Read a book, I'm bookin' flights
Dollar bills in my tummy, 2 countries, one night
Oh, keep up with my flow
I can teach you how to play, I can teach you how to play
Oh, keep up with my flow
I can teach you how to play, I can teach you how to play
My homie lend me some cash, thank you
Bartender filled my glass, thank you
Took a drug test and I passed, thank you
Pretty girls giving me that ass, and all I can say is, hm
