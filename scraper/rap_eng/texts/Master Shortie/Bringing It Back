OLD SCHOOL STYLE

(CHORUS)
I'M BRINGING IT BACK, BRINGING IT BACK
TO THEM OLD SCHOOL DAYS
CUZ YOU KNOW HOW WE DO IT BABY
LETS TAKE IT BACK TO THE 80S
DIRTY DANCING, PATRICK SWAYZE
STYLE WAS CRAZY
BACK IN THE DAY NOTHING PHASED ME
WHY ? I WASN'T EVEN ALIVE
I SAW THE 80S THROUGH MY MOTHER'S EYES
YOUR FLOWS 2 WEEK LIKE 14 DAYS
BEFORE THE STAGE, THE FAME, TODAY...

(CHORUS)
I'M BRINGING IT BACK, BRINGING IT BACK
TO THEM OLD SCHOOL DAYS
CUZ YOU KNOW HOW WE DO IT BABY
YOU DON'T LIKE MY STYLE
I'LL RUN WITH THAT
I'M A KEEP IT OLD SCHOOL
LIKE THUNDERCATS
THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT
LET'S SAVE THAT FOR ANOTHER TRACK
BACK IN THE DAY WE PLAYED ON THE SIDE
NOW KIDS LIKE TO PLAY WITH LIFE
SPRAY FROM THE RIDE
IT'S SURPRISING THEY'RE STAYING ALIVE THAT'S THE REASON I'M...

(CHORUS)
HIP HOP'S DEAD SO I'M BRINGING IT BACK
OLD SCHOOL FLOW WITH A DIFFERENT ATTACK
MASTER SHORTIE SO FRESH ON THE TRACK
MY HAIRS NOT PERMED SO JUST RELAX
OLD SCHOOL CHAIN. FRESH MOHICAN
IF YOUR MAN'S GOT STYLE IM THE REASON
BORN '89 SO STOP THE SPEAKING
IM ON THE BALL JUST LIKE KEVIN KEEGAN!
OLD SCHOOL STYLE
YOU DONT HAVE TO GROW OLDER
OLD SCHOOL STYLE
YEH YOU KNOW ITS NOT OVER
OLD SCHOOL STYLE
SO WE GOT SO YOU'RE STILL HERE
IF YOU DONT KNOW YOU BETTER KNOW...
