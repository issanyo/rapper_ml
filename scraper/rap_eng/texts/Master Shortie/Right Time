(CHORUS)
BREAKS MY HEART, EVERYTIME THAT YOU CALL
WANNA KNOW IF IT'S THE RIGHT TIME
TO SAY THE THINGS THAT I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW
OHHHHA WOOAHO YOU SHOULD LET IT GO
SHORTIE, LETS GO
THE RELATIONSHIPS GONE COLD
SO WHY AM I FUMING ?
I'M A HUMAN BEING SO I AM BEING A HUMAN
LOOK BACK IT WAS SO CONSUMING
LOVE THAN HATE IT WAS SO CONFUSING
BUT WE GO AT IT LIKE RABBITS
YOUR JEALOUSY IS ORGANIC
DRAMATIC LIKE A VOLCANIC ERUPTION (BABY)
OHH
ITS FUNNY HOW I USED TO LOVE YA
IT FELT ELECTRIC WHEN I TOUCH YA
BUT THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO
YOU WANT ME TO STAY BUT IT'S TIME TO GO!

(CHORUS)
DON'T BEG, YOU TOLD ME TO GET A BIG ISSUE
I KNOW I'M GONNA MISS YOU
I NEED TO DISMISS YOU
REMINISCE ABOUT THE SIGNS THE TIMES
WHEN THE HAIR UP ON MY LIP
WOULD TICKLE WHEN I KISS YOU
WAIT! IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING
MIND REFLETS HEART, IT KEEPS ON DRUMMING
WEIGHT OFF YOUR SHOULDERS SO YOU CAN WEIGH LESS
IMA LEAVE YOU A LOAN SO YOU CAN GAIN SOME INTREST
ITS FUNNY HOW I USED TO LOVE YA
IT FELT ELECTRIC WHEN I TOUCH YA
BUT THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO
YOU WANT ME TO STAY BUT IT'S TO GO!

(CHORUS)
OH...PLEASE DONT MAKE IT HARD
SHES TUGGING ON MY TEE SHIRT. HITTING MY CHEST
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER COZ YOU'RE LOOKING A MESS
(I SAID) OH THIS LOVE WEREN'T MADE TO LAST
THIS LOVE WEREN'T MADE TO LAST
SO PUT IT IN THE PAST AND LET IT GO
JUST LET IT GO!

(CHORUS)
