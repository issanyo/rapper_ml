Well I see you right over there
What you standing there for?
I said I see you right over there
What you standing there for?
You got your hands in your pockets
You got your back on the wall
So get your get your hands out your pockets
And get your ass on the floor
(You’re gonna) Dance Like a white boy
Dance Like a white boy
Dance Like a white boy
He’s ready to dance
Name is Lance
Been a long weekend, its his chance
To advance to another level
Feel the treble
He’s a rebel in the place
Sweat against his face
Two-step to the left
Forgets to brings his waste
So why you acting insecure? Standing up against the wall
Why you spend your money for? If your acting immature
Music’s a conditioner so loosen up and listen huh
You say that your cool so turn off the air conditioner
Well I see you right over there
What you standing there for?
I said I see you right over there
What you standing there for?
You got your hands in your pockets
You got your back on the wall
So get your get your hands out your pockets
And get your ass on the floor
(You’re gonna) Dance Like a white boy
Dance Like a white boy
Dance Like a white boy
If your night’s rubbish find a fox
Little fish, big fish cardboard box!
Do a sweet dance and tootsie roll
Be belligerent take control
Don’t restrain I'm on patrol
You don’t need feet but you do need soul
Move outta time like 61 seconds
When your sitting down tell me who you are impressing?
This is a dance off a different class
Take your pupils out your ass
Take that Stella out your glass
And just tell her to move fast
And just
Dance Like a white boy
Dance Like a white boy
Dance Like a white boy…
See I just wanna dance tonight, I don’t wanna pick a fight
Addicted lover, addicted lover
See I don’t wanna go tonight
'Coz there’s no place better
Addicted lover, addicted lover
Dance Like a white boy
Dance Like a white boy
Dance Like a white boy…
