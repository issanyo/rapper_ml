[Hook: XO Man]
I'm from a place people stop and stare
Carry small dogs and make what they wear
Cameras Flashing, Champagne Splashing, Money Dashing
This is the life we lead so come and follow fashion

Follow Fashion, Follow Follow Fashion
Follow Fashion, (Come, come come) Follow Fashion
This is the life we lead so come and follow fashion

[Verse 1: Mikill pane]
Ever since XO called on me like Eric Prydz to tear this shit
To many bits
I've been asking myself will they think of me as a trendy prick
In a pair of chinos and expensive kicks
Fixed gear bike doing lengthy skids
Peddling around, representing kids that are doing strictly independent bizz-ness
Is-this
Viewed as a life full of slick pretences
Well you cunts really should look deeper
You should have my prescription lenses
That I wear
Better still, get yourself some of that eyewear
Then Stand right there
I bet you'd still, get the impression that i'd care
I know that if I don't really show my emotions to such fools then I can't get hurt
But there's hardly a need for a heart on my sleeve, this is such a cool Benjart sweatshirt
So the only heart you'll see is on my chest right where the S should be
And your girlfriends also hate my style that explains why they're undressing me

Follow Fashion, Follow Follow Fashion
This is the life we lead so come and follow fashion

[Verse 2: XO Man]
I consume any room I'm in
Before anyone hears me rhyming
Too tall so forget climbing
Repeat after me Simon (Ayooo)
As I walk into the room it (Froze)
To see a 6"10 man wearing
Oh my god where diddy diddy diddy (uh) where did he get them clothes
Hair in two, runaway tache (Amazing)
??????????? with a rhyming gift that sounds (Amazing)
More style than a G G magazine, pitbull holler at me I'm (Amazing)
6"10 presence of big ben, tourists flash your cameras cos I'm (Amazing)
I've been covered in tweed from 1.5 plus a 10 bag of weed (Pause)
I've been dressing as fly from Simpsons days no Family Guy
Fly Co-D fontzerelli
Check Check Check me on your tele
Flashing a six pack no belly
???????? Yo Kenny

[Verse 3: Master Shortie]
They said it's impossible for me to rep the UK
Because of the way that I dress, yes, they say that I'm gay?
But i've been taking all of your chicks since like 03
So whilst you niggas are into beef
Me, I'm collecting poultry
Never smoking, never choking on this new new
I'm the shit so there ain't nothing I can't Do Do
Looking in my face saying I can't rap star
Now you're into skinny jeans, Snapbacks and Trapstarr
I'm a star that traps, in a solar system
Record Labels are pissed because they fucking missed em
Chicks think I'm hot, niggas say I'm cool
Regardless it's going down, Berlin Wall
And I don't really care, comfortable
Got so much drive, I'll never stall
