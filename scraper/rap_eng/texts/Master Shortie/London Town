EVER SINCE I ROSE, THEY'RE STEPPING ON MY TOES
USING THEIR SOLE SO THEY COULD DAMAGE MY SOUL
THEIR ENVY IS GREEN YET THEY'RE READY TO GO
WHEN THEY QUESTION THEY WAYS
THEY SAY THAT'S HOW THEY ROLL
READY TO GO
READY TO BLOW THE POPO
SCARED OF IMPURIFICATION OF THE SOUL NO
ITS A MILKY GOVERNMENT SO PASS THE COCO
TOO FAST MOVE BACK BACK
IM TRYING TO WATCH MY BACK BUT I CANT 360
I KNOW THE ROAD IS MISTY
SO I WALK IT SWIFTLY
IM BLESSED WITH THE SPIRIT AND YEAH HE'S HERE WITH ME
I CANT CHANGE THE THE FUTURE
BUT I CAN MAKE HISTORY

(CHORUS)
IM TRYING TO GET AROUND
THERES DELAYS ON THE UNDERGROUND
IM TRYING TO TO MAKE THAT POUND
IM REPPIN LONDON TOWN
LONDON CITY, LONDON TOWN
ITS THE PLACE I CALL HOME
LONDON CITYS WHERE I GET DOWN
THATS WHAT MAKES ME WHO I AM
LONDON TOWN - ITS THE PLACE I CALL HOME
I GET DOWN - AND THAT MAKES ME WHO I AM
YEAH, IMA SEARCH A NIGGA OUT LIKE A SAT NAV
TAKE HIS CHICK AND GET OUT OFF LIKE A BLACK CAB
LEAVE AND NEVER COME BACK LIKE A BLACK DAD
YO BRUV, THIS IS LONDON CITY, NO BAGHDAD
WHERE CHICKS ARE GETTING PREGNANT TO GET A CHEAP PROPERTY
SAYING GET ON TOP OF ME
REAL LIKE MONOPOLY
MAN IM TALKING ABOUT POLICE KEEP STOMPING ME
PULL UP YOUR TROUSERS, GET A JOB, TALK PROPERLY

(CHORUS)
LONDON CITY, LONDON TOWN
ITS THE PLACE I CALL HOME
LONDON CITYS WHERE I GET DOWN
THATS WHAT MAKES ME WHO I AM
LONDON TOWN - ITS THE PLACE I CALL HOME
I GET DOWN - AND THAT MAKES ME WHO I AM
WOAH OOH OOOHOO OHH OOH OOH
IM LIVING EVERYDAY WHERE THE RIVER DESCENDS
THE RIVER THAMES IS THE CENTER OF DIFFERENT ENDS
NORTH. SOUTH, EAST, WEST, YO IT REALLY DEPENDS
YOU COULD BE LIVING IN THE CITY OR SOMETHING, BIG BEN!
IN THE MILLENNIUM EYE, I WANNA BE AS HIGH AS THE MILLENNUIM EYE
SO I CAN TOUCH THE SKY, SIT BACK RELAX AND OPEN MY MIND
LITTLE THEO'S DOING OK. LITTLE THEO'S DOING FINE
POLLUTION IN THE AIR, BEEF AINT RARE
BUT THAT'S ALL IN THE PAST LIKE TONY BLAIR
MY PAST IS DARK BUT MY FUTURES BRIGHTER
LONDON'S A RAT RACE AND IM THE PIED PIPER

(CHORUS)
