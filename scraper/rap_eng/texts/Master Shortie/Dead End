Listen
I step out my yard with a new flo
Skinny jeans on and my hats low
Happiness fam that's the new cro
I clock Bnp argh no!
They say I'm short but I know
So I look to my leg and repeated negro
Like a toaster I collect dough
My lyrics are felt so no need to use biro!
My flows tight like two thongs
I roll with the mandem that are too strong
I lay low like futon and everyones like Yo whats wrong?
Im about to bus cause I've been waiting at this stop for too long
Theres a wifey draught, I clock one girl but me? I gotta cruise on

[Chorus:]
Don't look now, keep walking
Cause I got a girl at home
Waiting for me
And if I do look now 
Will I ever get over you?
'Cause it's a dead end
It's a dead end
Woh oh oh
How about we get a little closer?
Cause tonight you look hot like a samosa
Your be the melody ill be the beat
I'll play you cause I'm the composer
This is my composition
Followed by ammunition
New addition, expedition, definition
Change position
I know you like electro
I know you like electro

[Repeat Chorus:]
Two legs entwine, as I refine on Gods design tonight
I do a little rhyme, take a little time , so I hold you right
You and me together just think
I would take you for a nice drink
I would tell you the reason why but the verse is done
And shit, my pen just ran out of ink
Already we at home, ready to bone
And she gone and im thinking to myself
How the fuck she geting home?
I know i didn't flope like millenium dome
And im taking over control like Ken Livingstone
I roll up your thighs and your ready to moan
BUt listen my mums at home
I like you alot so please just stay
I dont know why you wanna go away Ayyyy!

[Repeat Chorus:]
Oh Oh
I know I like you but Oh No
I got a wifey at home, oh
She can cook much better than you
She looks much better than you
She does it better than
