My sound is the sweetest in the rougher style

[Chorus] X 2
Jump up, run the crowd
That's right, said it loud
In this life, never bow
Damn right, man, i'm proud
Death metal, under ground
Take the crown, here and now
Throw the towel, Shifter's sound
Held it down, breaking ground

[Verse 1: LifeRexall]
Amp it to eleven; spinal tap rap prototype
Bloody-knuckle; spit-box;
Stage-diving; open-mic
Bash the bouncers; lock the door
Put your lighters up; feel the rush
Break down the walls between both you and us

[Existereo]
Yo we bustin' while cowboys kickin' up dust
Cause in, rob we trust and you're about to get touched
Rush the stage to the sidewalk
With skills and some sly talk
Enough to catch a fade and i rhyme away i rock

[LifeRexall]
Welcome to chaos where the cobra clutch
Hold it up
This ain't the playoffs it's the finals
And we dawned the cup
No one calm conduct the song to raise and fist to palm
Escape Los Angeles; conquer the earth we walk upon

[Existereo]
Look Ra I'm famous
The nameless game is painless
I'm living kinda shameless
But they'll never fucking obtain this
The skill remains pure stainless
Remember when you're aimless
If i could gain one sane wish
I'd take it back to the brain bitch

[Chorus] X 2
Jump up, run the crowd
That's right, said it loud
In this life, never bow
Damn right, man, I'm proud
Death metal, under ground
Take the crown, here and now
Throw the towel, Shifter's sound
Held it down, breaking ground

[Verse 2: Awol One]
With no face you can't fuck with the academics
Well, you need this to kick-start your heart
Flat-line; can't compete with the realest
Mankind isn't even kind as me

[Radioinactive]
Skills are up on high degree
My third eye needs some Visine
Melting all these fake ass glaciers
Like a scoop of ice cream, hold it down
Like a thousand paper weights I'll break your face
And kick it out all your teeth with my bare feet
Now you better-

[Awol One]
Grow to realize only bad people go to heaven
Only drunk people beg for forgiveness
When nature can't even grow your food
When the reward is greater than the sacrifice

[Radioinactive]
Sacrifice exactly wrong
Mister all the fighting song
Pistols in the waistlines
Bout to light like Frankenstein
Guillotine to Antoinette
Kill and eat on my respect
Billion seas that I direct
Until the girls are breathing sex

[Chorus] X 2
Jump up, run the crowd
That's right, said it loud
In this life, never bow
Damn right, man, I'm proud
Death metal, under ground
Take the crown, here and now
Throw the towel, Shifter's sound
Held it down, breaking ground

[Verse 3: Akuma]
We won't stop
Never will
Always keeping it raw
When we roll with true skill
We hold it down
Let it be known
That when the shifters in the house
We took the microphone

[Die]
Die the immortal; black dorian gray
I hid away the pennies
So I stay young and never age
Deep inside the halls you can hear the dead talk
I stand beneath the moon
In the month of June

[Akuma]
Suicide it's a suicide
Ba da bup bai
We do or die want to run and hide
We the wise guys
So don't try to run
Cause eyes are quick to draw
When there's six million ways to die
Then choose one

[Die]
I'm the shadow in the dark
The whisper in the wind
The noise in the attic
Your last confession
I'm your heart that just got broken
The building set on fire
The frozen down the walls
The shadow rise and fall
