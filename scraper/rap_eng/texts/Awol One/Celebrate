Yeah..Alright
Look At Your Sloppy Little Dance
Internal And Cute And All Confident
You Won't Miss The Pet Names
I Can Never Forget
Just Like A Chop In Your Step
Come On Baby Just Like You Slide To The Left
We're Making Some Noise And Feel Real Fresh
Her And Her Friends They Get Ready In The Mirror
[Hook x2]
The Lord Has Blessed Us
Tonight We Celebrate And We Dress Up
We're Getting All Dipped
Turn It Up Til The Record Skips
[Verse 2]
Listen To Death Pop
It's The Cleanest Execution
Biblical Conundrum Music
Eternally Baffling Scholars Is How You Use It
Discover Your Genius
You Turn Up The Jukebox
You Look And The Crew Rocks?
She Looks Sexy In Tube Socks
[Hook]
The Lord Has Blessed Us
Tonight We Celebrate And We Dress Up
We're Getting All Dipped
You Turn It Up Till The Record Skips
