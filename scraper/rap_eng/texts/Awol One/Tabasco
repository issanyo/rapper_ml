[General Jah Mikey]
Yeah yeah!
Now the Shapeshifters in action!
Yeah man! Larger LA Jae, Circus and Die
Awol One [?]
Exist, yeah man
Radioinactive, Akuma, Life Rexall!

[Verse 1: Akuma]
The beats and the lyrics are dropping
The Shapeshifter crew is now rocking
Keeping it fresh from the coast to the west
I put it down on the mic over breaks like recess
We flex in this millennium around wack artists
But we ain't hearing 'em
Must get rid of them and save what's now played
And stop the plague before it spreads its evil ways

[Verse 2: LifeRexall]
Shifters as popular as white rappers can be
So we make money off more black ops than Tom Clancy
We sound clash irrationally master the heat
Capture the streets accept this defeat from the passenger seat
Shadow relief dastardly defeats
The first to speak the future antique passionately
Advancing our peaks
Cannibal speech that severs from miraculous reach
We fast for the feast and laugh in the face of the weak

[Chorus 1: General Jah Mikey]
Unh tell them the Shapeshifters don't care
You know we don't fear no we don't care
Shapeshifters don't fear
Ak bak a then
Ah rude boy then!
Let me see you clapping
Open open open open open

[Verse 3: Existereo]
Yo LA Jae go move the crowd
Easy on the cuts no mistakes allowed
I'ma rock that shit to make my mama proud
And if y'all suckas didn't hear me let me say it outloud
Existereo typical ill rhythm make the most of my life
In the time given; fine women i'm living, clean living
Keep it driven rockin' through this life
So what y'all think about that?

[Verse 4: Awol One]
Shapeshifters rap to a pulse of a cardiac
Wear my heart on my sleeve and have a heart attack
Got Top Ramen in my veins
Paranoid brain that can't maintain
Call 1-800 shut up; call 9-1-1 and get put on hold
My galaxy's dark and ugly
I resurrect raps from my veins when i'm cold

[Chorus 2: General Jah Mikey]
Unh tell them the Shapeshifters don't care
You know we don't fear no we don't care
Shapeshifters don't fear
Ak bak a then
Ah rude boy then!
Let me see you clapping
Open open open open open

[Verse 5: Akuma]
Ashes long gone in the wind in the heart of the storm
Thundering; entering with energy from the rays of the sun
With shapes rendering

[Verse 6: Existereo]
Remembering what December can bring
While the emperor's king was hung from a sling
Let's sing a song of six pence do it via sixth sense
Shapeshifters crew rockin' til we hit the fence

[Verse 7: LifeRexall]
We control respect from every century enter
Witness the spine tingling
Inventors of invention
The direct effect of intellect and depth
Threats over your roulette sects
We lack respect

[Verse 8: Awol One]
Night time comes; that's when they sneak out
Shake the can and let the paint leak out
So much defiance from the rebel alliance
Rethink your solution; no future

[Chorus 3: General Jah Mikey]
Unh tell them the Shapeshifters don't care
You know we don't fear no we don't care
Shapeshifters don't fear
Ak bak a then
Ah rude boy then!
Let me see you clapping
Open open open open open

Shapeshift
Shape shape shift
