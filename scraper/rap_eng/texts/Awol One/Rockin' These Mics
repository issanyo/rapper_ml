Yeah, yeah
Shapeshifters crew still running for y'all
Heating the brawl, sucker-punch the speaker on call
Shapeshifter crew still rocking these mics
And we be fighting for the grandeur on our big city nights
Shapeshifter crew still drunk as fuck
Roll so deep that you might get stuck
Shapeshifter crew with champion sound appeal
So let's hear L.A. Jae on the wheels of steel

[Life Rexall]
This is a introduction
The situation's a must when
Booth walls cave in the second I plug in
It's a Shapeshifter world and we're talking sucked in
And i'm taking y'all with me the exodus now begins

[Existereo]
Oh I am exist rock lock stock and two smoking barrels
A.k.a. stereo or the bad luck's barrow
Devil neck division
[?] muster madness missions
CVS is my set so guess my religion

[AWOL One]
Well, I'm AWOL One with ever-changing lyrics
You rap like a retarded baboon talkin'
Man with the rhymes, get open bar
The middle men take women and we act like stars

[Circus]
They call me Big Kid Zelda and I'm the king of emcees
I'm not as shallow as all you pop stars are
I came here to tell you that dead men tell no tales

Shapeshifter crew still moving your boxes
Cause the Shapeshifter crew's always down for whatever
Shapeshifter crew still smoking your shit
In the V.I.P. lounge sucking on some tits
Shapeshifter crew'll still catch you off-guard
So it's best to think twice before acting all hard
Shapeshifter crew still setting off the sirens
And for DJ Rob One a moment of silence


[Die]
Some say i'm evil, some say I'm shy
To my parents I'm most able
To y'all my name is Die
I'm from the Shapeshifters
My home is in L.A. where the underground rocks
And the Krylons get sprayed

[Akuma]
When Akuma's on the mic expect nothing but heat
Cause I always keep it hype when I'm rocking to the beat
And if a sucker wanna fight, I'm knocking the teeth
And i'm smoking on the quill if they're looking for the reef

Shapeshifter crew still rocking these mics
