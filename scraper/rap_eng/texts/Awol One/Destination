You Listen Up It's So Hard To Explain
The Way I Feel Cause I Am Your Brain
The Way You See In Your Heart
The Light Of Day Like To Make A New Start
Me And You We Can Grow Old Together
We'll See The Truth And We'll Grow'em All Together
When You Were There When I Was So Down
And I Miss You Bad When I'm Out Of Town
[Hook]
Yeah Well It's Not The Destination
It's The Journey We Should Love
[Verse 2]
I Want My Shadow To Be Friends With His Shadow
Out In The Desert See They Shake And Rattle
You Know My Heart Is Fragile Cold As A Rock
Now We're Together And Time Stops
We're In The Sky Singing A Song
(Now Bring It) Welcoming A Brand New King And Queen
Spill The Words A Convulsion Occurs
Remember The Time..
[Hook]
Yeah Well It's Not The Destination
It's The Journey We Should Love
