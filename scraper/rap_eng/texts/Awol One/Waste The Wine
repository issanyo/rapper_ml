(Tash)
I Put The Pedal To The Metal Yeah I Smash The Gas
That's Why The World Will Never Ever See The Last Of Tash
Just Think Of How Many House Parties I've Crashed
Got A Bad Reputation Slapping Bitches On The Ass
Ask Anybody In The Hip Hop Community
You Don't Believe Them Then Get Online And Google Me
You'll See I Toured The Whole Planet
Downing Hennessy While You Sipping Pomegranate
Me I'm Not A Actor Just A Subtractor
Here To Get It Popping And That's The Main Factor
Me I'm Not The Law I'm Just The Main Draw
Here To Get It Popping With The Homie Awol
Up For The Challenge Walking Off Balance
I Like To Get Drunk When Expressing My Talents
So Peace To Swift And (?) Next Time You See Me I'll Be Partying In Canada
[Hook]
Friends Don't Let Friends Waste The Wine
So Now We're Going To Party In The Middle Of The Street
Friends Don't Let Friends Waste The Wine
So Now We're Going To Party In The Middle Of The Street
(J-Ro)
Got The Bar On Lock Get Drunk Like Hancock
My Band Rocks Shows Canada To Bangkok
Ask Anybody Who Know Bout The Liks
Hey Yo You Got To Be Kidding Them Boys Is The Shit
Hey Yo We Been Around The World
Partied With The Best Of Them
Drank With Alot Of Them
Smoked With The Rest Of Them
From The East To The West Of Them
All The Little Groupies Want To Get Next To Them
And They Hope We Want To Mess With Them
Get Them Drunk Take Them Home Have Sex With Them
I Still Keep A Fifth In The Trunk
I Might Fuck A Ugly Bitch But Only When I'm Drunk
No I'm Just Playing
I Ain't Trying To Mac Out
I'm Just Trying To Cut Like My Homeboy Factor
Head Banging Beats Call A Chiropractor
Awol I'm Out I'm Going To Holler At Ya
[Hook]
Friends Don't Let Friends Waste The Wine
So Now We're Going To Party In The Middle Of The Street
Friends Don't Let Friends Waste The Wine
So Now We're Going To Party In The Middle Of The Street
(Awol One)
Give The Walrus A Shot Of Molotov
Like Here's A Taste Alcoholocaust
Like You Put One Foot In Front Of The Right
Some Prostitutes Party All Night
Fraternity Boys Like To Chase You Around
And Drinking Enough To Make A Fish Frown
We Love Hip Hop And It Loves Us Back
But We'll Turn It Off If Your Shits Wack
Well Look At Me We're Like A Dancing Spider
Tonight I'm Not The Designated Driver
She Just Wants To Be Up Inside Her
And He's Just One Of Them Dumb Liars
My Homies Wasted And Peed His Pants
Every One Came Here Tonight To Dance
Put Your Hands In The Air If Your Down With The Liks
Whatever You Do Don't Puke On My Kicks
[Hook]
Friends Don't Let Friends Waste The Wine
So Now We're Going To Party In The Middle Of The Street
Friends Don't Let Friends Waste The Wine
So Now We're Going To Party In The Middle Of The Street
