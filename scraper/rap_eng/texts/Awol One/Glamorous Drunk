Little Baby Can You Read In The Dark
I Know You See The Truth And It Doesn't Make Sense
Pushing The Blanket Your Pulling The Pillows Your Eating The Spiders
Your Telling A Few Jokes Laugh At The Good Folks
And Only When You're Really Drunk Is When You Smoke
Counting Down Everyday Until You Croak
MC's Are Stupid I Rap Circles Around Them
And All The Bad Feelings In The World Get A Pounding
When You've Made A Ton Of Good Or Bad Choices
All I've Learned To Ignore The Voices
Yeah Glamorous Drunk
[Hook x2]
Glamorous Drunk
You're Looking Real Neon Today You're Looking Sharp
Welcome To Your Future
Is It Everything That You Thought It Would Be
[Verse 2]
Now You Order One More Shot
Now You Order One More Plot
But Then You Forgot
You Got To Thank God For Everything That You Got
When You Love Her So Much
When Your Craving Her Touch
And In The Grand Scheme Of Things It Means Much
Until You Drink It Until Your Mind Is Numb And You Go To Sleep
Then Think About Her Twenty Times A Week
And Do Mc's They Know About Your Loss
Little Mc's They Know About Your Cost
Little Mc's They Know About Your Loss
And They Don't Even Know What The Rap Life Cost
They Don't Even Know
They Don't Even Know What The Rap Life Cost
You Don't Even Know What The Rap Life Cost
Well They Don't Even Know What The Rap Life Cost
So Check It
[Hook]
Glamorous Drunk
You're Looking Real Neon Today You're Looking Sharp
Welcome To Your Future
Is It Everything That You Thought It Would Be
