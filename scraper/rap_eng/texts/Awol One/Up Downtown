Well I'm The Master Of Balance
With Multiple Talents
I Provide The Landscape Baby
You Provide The Challenge
I've Been Broken Down And Out
And Look At This Sound I'm Drowning Out
I'm Around The Town And I'm Round About
And It's Better Then The Dick In Your Freaking Mouth
These Words Might Scare You
Make You Tremble And Double Dare You
Now Were Always Learning
Always Listening (?)
Your Not Checking The Resume
Two Thumbs Down Is What They Say
Uptown Get Down
Downtown Get Up
Uptown Trying To Get Down
Downtown Trying To Get Up
Drink It Up Till Your Dizzy
Stay Away From Thin Like Lizzy
Touch Her Trembled Chest
And Look At What A Walrus Digests
Last Halloween
I Gave You My Heart
Very Next Day You Gave It Away
Made You Disappear
Downtown Yell Uptown Rebel
One Love One City One Now
Got Some Raps Mc's Never Heard
Ohh Baby I Like It War
Sometimes Land Like A Future Shock
Look At My Radio Rock The Block
(?) And A Tall Can
I'm Sponsored By Every Brand
Turn Your Radio Up
Uptown Trying To Get Down
