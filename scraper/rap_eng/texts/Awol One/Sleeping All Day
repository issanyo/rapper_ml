I've figured out by now, I'm gonna live forever
No one's a legend until they pass away
Asking anyway who's running this asylum
A young manic depressive giving her a smile
Pull up a chair, I'll think here for a while
Girls on the floor, trying to wax tile
AWOL One just trying to freeze fire
Forever emceeing till the night I retire
I can feel the stare coming through the radio
Sleeping all day must be the way to go

Cause where I go, I leave no prints
Sleeping all day must be the way to go

I've been up all night, sleeping all day
My father wasted sperm when he made me
And it's hard enough nowadays just acting normal
Still gotta be to work on time
I've been up all night, sleeping all day
My father wasted sperm when he made me
Hard enough nowadays just acting normal
Still gotta be to work on time

Now all you soak up is another drink
Friday night, two dollar thinks
But overdose is the theme of my life
I wish I had me a dog right now so I could kick him
Sleeping all night, last call two A.M
Seven A.M. it's time to go to work again
Drinking caffeine in the morning feeling ill
Blow up on stage, just by standing still!
Dance like it's your last day on earth
I've got this talent I can do with my eyes
I can change 'em from brown to blind
Up all day, sleeping all night

In line for an hour just to get in
Only to see a group that was wack
Overconfident with nothing to say
I couldn't hear 'em cause it sounded like crap anyway
But you're at the spot, eyes searching for sea
Said I wonder if she'd go for a loser like me
But you're young and you fall in love with anything
Trying to stare down somebody's daughter
Looking like a million bucks, just to touch
But knowing that cats always land on their feet
From Whitter Blvd. she's walking in the street
But do your dance like it's your last day on earth
To shake what your mother gave you at birth

I can feel the stare coming through the radio

I've been up all night, sleeping all day
My father wasted sperm when he made me
And it's hard enough nowadays just acting normal
Still gotta be to work on time
I've been up all night, sleeping all day
My father wasted sperm when he made me
And it's hard enough nowadays just acting normal
Still gotta be to work on time

Dance like it's the last day on earth
I've got this talent I can do with my eyes
I can change 'em from brown to blind
Up all day, sleeping all night
Dance like it's your last day on earth
I've got this talent I can do with my eyes
I can change 'em from brown to blind
Up all day, sleeping all night
