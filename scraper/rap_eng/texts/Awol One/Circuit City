[Circus]
Hey, hey
Let's move on down to
The next Shapeshifters show
And then we'll get real irate

[Existereo]
Go and get your party here
'bout to have the party here
Only time I'm looking back is in my rear-view mirror
Bite the bullet, bite the bone, diamond studded microphone
Life explodes while secrets shown and
Feel the glory of rhinestone
Rock the mic L.A. to Frisco
Told the baby, "Meet me at the disco."
Showed up late didn't mean to dis though
She was mad and pulled a pistol
Don't you know my sugar mama
Is the one to bring the drama
When she sees me with my two coke-head girlfriends

[Akuma]
Slide to the left, now slide to the right
And move like a robot
Stomp your feet, back to the middle, now clap
Hey

[LifeRexall]
Tom in Storey was known to hold keys
So Frankie went to Hollywood to score some o.z.'s
He struggled with addiction shedding Tears for Fears
One of dancing's [?] for a second career
A chronic house in the middle of the street
When the Madness began his high started to peak
Setting up for a deal that felt wrong
He made a quick call to bring the Thompson twins along
They have his back with a pair of twin straps
In case he had to tip caps to Men Without Hats
And the man started to hustle with government grants
In excess of a million to invest in these plants
But it was a trap, sitting right across the border
For the love of money he had readied the coroner
So little did he know Frankie arrived at his burial
Now find a missing person on the Mexican Radio

[Akuma]
I'm from a planet, far away
I came to dance, get out of my way
I'm here to move to the groove
Getting down, is what I came to do
I'm from the future, I travel space
My shit's infused one small brace
I can move fast or take it slow
I'm here to get freaky and get low

[Circus]
Hey, shake it girl
Come on shake it like
Come on shake it girl
Come on shake it like
A Hot Dog On A Stick
Employee
Making lemonade
Hey!

[AWOL One]
The chase is on, you're so mechanical
Well you will win some and you will win some
You step the heck off, I'll twist your neck off
And eat my dust then totally combust
Well can you take it?
I was born naked
Take my hand but don't feed the models
Just feed me bottles and rock down to
Yeah I want to dance it so spastic

[Circus]
The suspicions are true
Doomsday's been postponed just for a tiny second
Right now it's time to boogie oogie woogie
So best recognize sucka
Play it like Circus use your subconscious most of the time
Even though I'm chub lee girls still love me
And I'm gonna party like it's 1999
Call me a hypocrite whatevers
Cause Kid Zelda's always gives it back to the community
For the sake of humanity, Shapeshifters
Backstage chillin' like billionaires
Boobies gone wild in a blow up swimming pool
Full of mad jello shots, yeah
Livin' la vida herpes

[Radioinactive]
To all the ladies in the kingdom
Pretty Asian wanna download a ringtone
Now the party people all have a theme song
Just another principle for nutrition
For the tupper-ware that withered in the continent
Hopping on the land like I'm sitting on the pleasure button
I'm an honest man but I ain't gonna tell you
Not to do the promised land on a magic carpenter
A mechanical woman looking at my belly button?
