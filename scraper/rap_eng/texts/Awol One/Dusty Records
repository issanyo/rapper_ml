Every clap tears you up
The words hurt and I'm bruising fate
Maybe I'm too predictable
Maybe you were never content

I just want to share every day
Maybe obsess with being obsessed
Sorry I'm so stupid and dumb
Always letting down everyone

When you create your worst fears
And now you paid a million dollars in taste and tears

I wish I could hear you laugh again and kiss your funny faces

I can't play music anymore
'cause it reminds me of him
The record crates are deep
I got a lot of dusty records to dance to
Got a lot of dusty records to dance to
Got a lot of dusty records to dance to

I was there the first time you saw snow
Thought that it would last forever
Walking in the streets of Amsterdam
With my best friend
Hoping some day we might procreate
A little baby
That kinda look like both of us
And try to provide
The soul-less system all gift-wrapped up

In a smiley text face
Mutual friend still left behind
Hopefully you'll become a respectable woman
And accomplish things

And I can't play music anymore
'cause it reminds me of him
The crates are dusty and deep
I got a lot of records to dance to
Got a lot of records to dance to
Got a lot of records to dance to

Well I was there
I was there
Your clap tears me up
Your words hurt like a bruise and fate
Maybe I'm too predictable

And I can't play music anymore
'cause it reminds me of him
These record crates are deep
Got a lot of dusty records to dance to
Got a lot of dusty records to dance to
Still got a lot of dusty records to dance to
Dusty records to dance to
Still got a lot of dusty records to dance to
Well I was there
Well I was there
Still got a lot of dusty records to dance to
Well I was there
