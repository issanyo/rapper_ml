Wake Up In The Morning Look At My Face
The Walrus Worn I Just Walked In The Place
The Flip Over The Pillow A Scratch At The Dome
Like I Got To Thank God For My Family Friends And Home
Yeah Where The Buffalo Roam
Shapeshifter Crew Still In The Zone
Get Us A Twelve Pack And Celebrate
It's A Saturday Deplete Your Ego In A Badder Way
Do Right As Much As I Can
You Got To Step To The Plate To Be A Man
Working Late
Owl Hours
Celebrate With My Owl Powers
Sunrise Open Your Eyes
Can't See Through Your Rap Disguise
Walk To Duffy's Get A Bloody Mary
Use My Shoes No 502's
(Hook)
Wake Up Again Like I'm One Day Older
Going Back Had The Wisdom I Told Her
And All The Students They All Die
All We Can Do Till The Day We Fly
In A Hole Deep Like A Heart Thats Faithful
I'll Be Your Man And Eternally Greatful
Hold The Pulse Stealing My Veins
Your My Heart And I'm Your Brains
Going To The Bar Take Over The Jukebox
Me And My Girl Bumping Some Dancehall
The Moon Is Full The Owls Awake
Sundials Broke And The Seas A Joke
Look Forward To Seeing My Daughter Smile
The Light Of My Life My Baby Child
If This Ain't Raw Yo Whats The Word
I'm The School Bully And The School Nerd
(Hook)
