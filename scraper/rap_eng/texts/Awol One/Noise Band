[Verse 1: AWOL One]
Going on a walk to clear my head
First step: gotta crawl out of bed
I'll tell all the jokes around here
I am dirty and the mud is clear
The banks of the river never run out of money
And over the years, things are less funny
The original ones are disappointed
Society, humanity anointed
Three generation specialists
Watchmen close down the bar
I will deep fry these words
'Cause they have won awards
And when I'm hurt she kisses my stab wounds
Listen to my tempo, gentlemen
I'm wearing my skeleton on tour
And I never been a better man

[Verse 2: Gregory Pepper]
Going on an angry walk again
Moby Dick, Larry David, leviathan
Guess who's back in the motherfucking pond
Dickfish Pepper whistling the sweater song
It's been too long since I chilled with Walrus One
The years fly by but the days drag on
The little songs are ghosts on stand-by
Wanted to escape from LA like Kurt Russell
Felt like I was famous for a bit
When I opened for Freestyle Fellowship
But you can't buy real estate in people's minds
Homie, you have to earn that shit
So I'll quit alienating my friends and family
With talks of conspiracy theories
And maybe try being agreeable
To the people that wanna be near me

[Chorus: Gregory Pepper]
Even for a noise band, I know we're sorta lame
But if you just follow on then, I'll try and rock your brain
Even for a noise band, I know we can't keep trying
But if you stick around girl, I'll try and blow your mind

[Verse 3: Ceschi]
Hope you live as long as A Maximus
Hope we grow old and half as tough
Hope they let me back into Canada
I promise not to sell any marijuana
Maybe make a couple of daughters like Walrus One
Maybe make a couple of dollars that last for once
Stuck in a manhole feeling fat as fuck
This city is killing me, literally, no bluff
I'm Big Pun flying to the nearest KFC
Buildings are just Toblerones beneath me
I'm Pigpen dusty at the folk-punk show
Doing cover songs of Johnny Hobo
Bro blow, you know, some coke white shows
You're not fooling anybody, buddy, so let go
No more witch-house trap triangles
No more dubstep dance-rap angles, no

[Chorus: Gregory Pepper]
Even for a noise band, I know we're sorta lame
But if you just follow on then, I'll try and rock your brain
Even for a noise band, I know we can't keep trying
But if you stick around girl, I'll try and blow your mind
