(Awol One)
Way Back Then
I Was A Vandal In A Hoodie
I Still Am
She Jocked My Graffiti Styles
We Exchanged Saliva
To Each Other Like Champions
I Was Wally Mathers And She Was Gidget Cleaver
We Held Skins And Watched Movies On Government Cover Ups
Ate Exotic Foods Till We Both Felt Like Throwing Up
Meet Me By My Locker At Lunch After Detention
And We Can Sacrifice Animals Like We Used To Back Then
(Gregory Pepper)
Way Back Then I Was In A Fogless Shador
We Held Hands
I Carried Your School Books For You
I Couldn't Understand
Why You Were Cutting Your Thighs
You Wanted All Me
I Wanted To Drink With The Guys
Your Parents Home I Was Eddie Haskell
All Alone In Your Parents Home
I Heard You Crying While I Hit It From Behind
And I Kept On Coming Till I Ruined Your Life
But Now
[Hook]
(Ceschi)
Way Back Then
When My Dreams Were Still Vivid And Innocent
And My Cock Could Still Get Hard At The Sight Of A Blow Pop Touching Your Lips
I Never Thought That A Beard Could Actually Grow To Cover My Body Whole
But I Finally Know What It's Like To Be Old
Now That Your Gone
With A Bolt So Snug That It Competes With  Heartbeats of The Comatose
I'm Sleeping Alone On A Twin Sized Mattress Clutching On To Your Ghost
Well Wondering About What It Could Have Been Without All The Mistakes I Have Made
I Haven't Changed Too Much These Days
Since Way Back Then
[Hook]
