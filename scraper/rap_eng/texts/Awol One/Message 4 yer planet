Welcome to voice print identification
When you see the red light go on
Would you please state in the following order:
Your destination, your nationality, and your full name

[Chorus] X 2
This is a message from our planet our planet
Leader of the early world had you fooled
Watching him act a fool

[Verse 1: AWOL One]
You tell me I don't deserve it, you should preserve it
We are the wordsmith; you won't conserve it
When it's occurrence, kill for the insurance
With the sound breaking your skull

[Radioinactive]
Shape-shifting your consciousness
By switching negative with love
The bloodlines of the billionaires with
Trillions who run the world
Or when government controls
Your mind through media and fear
We are here to travel through your time
To make you all aware

[Existereo]
Just to stop the people that pretend
That they don't even care

[Radioinactive]
We're not sent to travel across the globe
To get a bite to eat

[Existereo]
Walking through our city just to make
The time to stomp our feet

[Radioinactive]
Hoping to encourage you to make the most
Of your time on earth

[Chorus] X 2
This is a message from our planet our planet
Leader of the early world had you fooled
Watching him act a fool

[Verse 2: AWOL One]
Because earth is the ground that's breaking your soul
Verbs kill the noun and it's shaking your whole
We'll be around if you're making the bowl
Into a pound that's taking it's toll

[Radioinactive]
Shape-shifting your consciousness
By switching negative with love
The bloodlines of the billionaires with
Trillions who run the world
Or when government controls
Your mind through media and fear
We are here to travel through your time
To make you all aware

[AWOL One]
This is a message for your planet

[Existereo]
The world's doesn't mind a lots of futile evolution
And I'm learning while I travel and I'm learning by solution
Now we're doing what we're doing
So there is no more confusion
So come join us through our psycho institution

[Chorus] X 2
This is a message from our planet our planet
Leader of the early world had you fooled
Watching him act a fool

[Verse 3: AWOL One]
I've been asking the questions
Everlasting impressions
Multi-tasking the lessons
DJ scratch the confessions
Like a turntable made out of flesh
We're unstable; behave at our best
Listen humans, this is our message
Pathetic planets subliminal suggestions

[Existereo]
Living for the moment
And the art that is the underground
Spitting with your heart
So now I always bring the thunder sound
Shifters are the quietest
So listen to what the hunter's found
We are the dark riders
And this is the fucking underground

[Radioinactive]
Right at an airport near you
Is a government base that you can't even see

[Existereo]
Rampost til dawn and the smell of a new town

[Radioinactive]
If I'm under the season of barbecue
By having a panic attack pay attention to me

[Existereo]
And one more time, this is the fucking underground

[Chorus] X 4
This is a message from our planet our planet
Leader of the early world had you fooled
Watching him act a fool
