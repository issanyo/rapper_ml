Redrum redrum redrum
Come and play with us
Crimes against humanity

[Circus]
Yo, there ain't nothing wrong with my attitude problem (what?)
Cause if ya got one, then you need to sit down and have a talk with my imaginary pal

[Existereo]
Big Johnny Simpson, he got twenty seven lullabies
Sits up on the window sill and listens to the doves cry
Devils try to multiply the evil sin I wonder why
Under a sky so glorious there's nothing left but horror for us
Big Johnny Simpson see he thinks about murder
And if he was able the way that he would hurt her
The labor of love and the burden of his life
And the way things were and his shiny new knife
Because Big Johnny Simpson lives his days in anger
Does not leave his room because he likes the torture chamber
Stranger to sanity doesn't know what to say
Let's leave him in his room because it's safer that way

[LifeRexall]
Disgruntled as he pummels
Through the jungles of Los Angeles
He's down to higher risk
Taking these hits off sticks of cancerous
He'll be the last to quit til death calls collect and he answers it
Perched up in the watchtower for hours watching [?]
Bad luck is imminent and prospers in the tenements
One of its many menaces reformed by jail sentences
The o.g. don't know his name, just his number
And the outside world ain't cut and dry
It's still eternal slumber from Y.A. to the big show
He toughened up but didn't grow
Now at the age of fifty he'd be set free on his own
But the system befits him and the will to live is over
So he took a seat under the bridge with a pistol in his molars

[Circus]
Before he got the electric chair while he was locked up in jail
Serial killer Ted Bundy got over two hundred love letters a day
From women that claimed they loved him
Even Hitler had a girlfriend
If Ted Bundy can have a girlfriend, then damn it, why can't I?
(what?)

[Die]
They call him the loose cannon a.k.a. Charlie
Fucked up in the head, favorite word is "dead"
He sits in his attic, playing with his knives
He cuts himself all over, until he passes out
He gets drunk all the time, plays with his guns
Fires them all off until he shoots his head off
He takes a lot of drugs, likes to hallucinate
Breaks out DVD's watches girls masturbate
He's fucked up all the time
He never really remembers
So he tattoos everything just like in memento
Charlie wants to live in the sky
Charlie, get a grip and die

[AWOL One]
His name is question mark
He's hiding in the dark
And there's one in every park
And he's waiting for the victims
With a screwdriver in his pocket
He'll stab it through or inside her
Or anyone who talks shit
Panhandles money to buy some kind of blast off
Jekyll and Hyde [?]
Maybe talks to himself cause he's a genius
Or gets a thrill out of killing you with a rock
Shadow shadow shadow in the trees
Bipolar schizophrenic disease
Sick minded, will make ya start giggling
Like three blind crippled crazy senior citizens

[Circus]
You're a hazard to others, you're a hazard to yourself
Homie you need help my diagnosis
Justice and divine vengeance in pursuing crime
The job of a dirty cop
How much you wanna bet I put a stop to you
Before you kill again
Because there's nothing wrong with your
Attitude problem

[Radioinactive]
Parents abandoned me
Cause I'm ugly and they hated me too
My name is Lance and I'm on medication
Looking for a blue eyed blonde haired grandson
In a neighborhood near you
Cause I'm alone and I am a garbage man
Wanna see my farmer's tan or a cartoon?
Here is a balloon jump into my funny van
Here is some candy for you
I'll tie you up and tickle you
Then I'll torture you
Chop you up into little pieces
And I'll dump you in the garbage truck
Boo
(then I'll fuck your bloody carcass)

[Circus]
Your prison stories don't impress me much
It's true you've lost it and gone nuts (redrum)
With a few screws loose you're a total basket case
A psychopathic sociopath
With a psychotic mind of a lunatic
You're a fanatical maniac
With a sick sense of humor
And several split personalities
Mad man on a rampage
You're as deranged as they come
Ted Bundy with an atom bomb
Sawed up hookers in the garbage bin
The streets aren't safe for anyone
With you on the loose

(redrum)
(I'm scared)

[Radioninactive]
I would never do that
Hey where's your parents?
Give yourself a quarter
Would you like to see a movie?
Do you know how to blow bubbles?

(you having a bad dream?)
