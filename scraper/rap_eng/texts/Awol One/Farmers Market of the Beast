Iguanas, in the farmers market
Lions, in the farmers market
Billy goats, in the farmers market of the beast
Snakes, in the farmers market
A walrus, in the farmers market
Lab chimps, in the farmers market of the beast

[Verse 1 - Xololanxinxo]

Now I'm an Iguana and I move like I wanna
Through the hills of Tijuana that's decapin trees
Who will remember me?
As a silent swings
Pale in a ring, lizard with a blizzard tell me what do you bring
A story, of my master Xololanxinular
Who sinks in trouble just a little too much, crush
Another person hits the ground, pound to a hair
He kicks 'em around and I wonder why
I'm, in this leash
If he's the one who always acts like a beast
Addiction to preparing a ten knuckle feast
Oh my master, you are responsible for the 80% of the blood on the streets
The dying ocean and the air we breathe
Can you take me home cause of the soon to be extinct tropic
Shut up before killing you becomes the topic
Savage, yeah, the savages, inhuman
Killing is booming
How do you know?
They be doing it already yo
And I do it just to take your vehicles
Car, then come up, bloody body hits the ground
And you mash out
Don't let a trace of this fall from your mouth
Words, bodybag with bricks, throw 'em off the pier
And let the current take 'em south
Master, I'm keeping it shut cause I know what you're talking about
You think you been keeping it quiet?
Police in riot gear surround the house
You think you've been keeping it quiet?

[Verse 2 - Jizzm]
Can you hear the roar of the competitor
Predator war, veteran, not a veterinarian
Nor a vegetarian, carrying more blood and gore
In my jaws of sharks, who bite despite the laws of nature
I'm gonna grate ya heads to shreds with my claws
Straws get drawn, I'mma put you on by puttin on
The hits, I'mma hit mammal, you're a
Hitman couldn't hit sand if you fell off a camel, ?hit wrist?
You're finished like furniture ennamel
Getting stormed out by the brain
I wore a golden crown and a brown majestic mane
Lounging on the top of the food chain
I'm a lion-king of the beast in the concrete jungle
The kingdom of truth, nobody out there be misled
Led by the prey dead
You got no proof that I did it
Another meal committed and
I've been acquitted for insufficient evidence
My friends call me Jizz but you can call me
Your majesty or your eminence
Whatever your preference
You best use reverence to these testaments
So my scriptures'll rips ya skull from your necks
And corrects ya under estimates


[Verse 3 - Radioinactive]
From metropolitan, righteous serving mountain come billy goat
Billy goats grub the supplies
Ever since the prince of darkness disguised himself as a creature of God
Cloven pig, clovers to eat
Unlucky, luck is derivative, contributive by Lucifer
Listen to the Pit and the Pendulum
If you want some money, lend you some
For the independent Pentagon
Independence day will depend on the bender ground
What is the purpose of the harlot posin' and the picture of the penthouse
In the path penitentiary
Pay attention to the fella penetrating
Couldn't tell every fella choose to worship me
Like the golden calf
Ready veggies served in the cafeteria
??????? of a different  kind, that will make you jump high
Which is short for hell-oooo
Drink a cup of coffee in the copper coffin
In he caffinated area down low
Looted ?????
Computer generated Babylon BC, pay see virus
At your fingertips, coordinated with the iris
And your fingerprints, put your finger on the syphilis
It will make your father sin with a lady evil
Maybe even sacrifice a baby with a coat hanger
Dunk your daughter in the water like Salem Massachusetts witch hunt
Word is bondage kid, I live in your eyelid
Look into the cornea of a capricorn, cornucopia
Complimentary, cornerstone
Can a dog, can a com, can a car
Run from a pair of chupa-chupacabra
Parachuting from a saucer shaped candelabra
Kill the people in my sleep
Let this be a warning to the ways of the wickedness

[Verse 4 - Jizzm]
Serpents, slithering snakes in the grass
Snakes in the trees of my past
Serving apples, saying it keeps the doctor away
An apple a day is the wrong way to live this all
Ladies, reptiles in your trials and tribulations
Although I see through the eyes that recognize infilitrating ships
I'm still decapitating Satan for the raping escaping feast
Don't be destroyed in the farmers market boy
The market of the beast


[Verse 5 - Awol One]

Don't let your right hand know, what your left is doing
Spent my time pursuing what felt right since day one
I was hatched, microphone umbilical
Amplified intestines, my cries used to rhyme
Just a space monkey in a tin foil hat
Do a posing reception from my anchor in his ass
Decoding files, hairy mammals, smiles
Running around wild style, pale animals
Trials of life, and death on the mic
Berenstain times but can't bare the fact
Everybody wants to rule the world with their raps
Equal opportunity the sunlights shines
All over my forrest with the carnivore mind
Most MCs dont wake up this early
Cuz in their cave all the flows sound the same
Don't let the confusion blind you
MCs that bite, mind you
They're the only ones to blame
In the farmers market

[Verse 6 - Circus]

Like an ape with a cape
I'm like some type of super futuristic primate
From the planet of the hairless apes
MCs are going ape shit, silly
Willy Wonka, totally bonkers, bananas
Hannah Barberas, Blundar, the barbarian
Burstin' in out the sanitarium
Collecting money for the man playing the accordion
Aquarium of sea-monkeys who
Monkey see, monkey do you see what i do these clueless
MCs are giving me goosebumps
Pucker up, buttercup, for the plungers suction cup
Sucker, punching is for punk-sucker chums
I'm a lab chimp, champion in the fast food
Experiment, like Jimi Hendrix
You need to get experience
But what's all of this, monkey-business men
At every open mic I find 12 monkeys on my back
Attacking with the monkey wrench
Henchmen, lynchin', sacrificing goats on the altar
Vultures swarming with forks and napkins
This looks like a job for Captain Caveman
With the man sized tales of the gold monkey
Man what will it be, do you wanna make a monkey out of me
Monkey see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
But people say we moneky around
Monkey shine, shock the monkey, spank your monkey
Go ahead have a barrel of monkeys
Everyones got something to hide except for me and my monkey
A monkey is my uncle
Is my distant cousin kissing a martian, Darwin?
Ancient alien life form
Word is born, step up and get reborn
Transform into a buddhist monkey, avenue monk
Peasants from other countries, they're starving
They're serving monkey brains as a delicacy
Drinking brass monkey
Drunken flippin, broken cookies crumblin'
Concrete jungle gym, Morrison
Rumble in the bronx, barroom barnyard brawl
I was a teenage neanderthal - call of the wild styles
Manchild, man cub, like Tarzans loyal companion
I ain't the man or the chief
MC'S are the king of the beast
Beneath the surface
Mosquitos feast on the deceased
Blood of the Earth mother
Rest in peace, soul provider, easy rider
I rides on the back of the worlds
Largest pterodactyl, black hole
Fooooools gold, going going gone so
We got the right to know, we got the right to grow
7 foot long beards, if we want to die for
A dead dinosaur
Sucker
