[Verse 1: Lakutis]
Ay yo, let’s go
Text those bitches with the boots
Sex for X though, bury with the goose
Stomp you out with some now or later shoes
Now or later choose
Violator proof!
Flask of Henny in the suit
Becky in the coup
Now she wanna spoon like Jewish Eddie for the soup
You better know my flow so cold mothafucka
Bust a nut like a icicle put it in her

[Hook x2]
I got these young hoes boppin'
That’s right, I’m an animal
(no shit bitch)
I got the champagne poppin'
That’s right I’m a animal
(No doubt mothafucka I’m ill!)

[Verse 2: Lakutis]
Chill bitch sit with this on a Adderall
Coke dope float up nose I’m a animal
Mojo so OD my father is the sea
Motherfucka, I’m the truth
I’ll run up on you soon
Rock the soccer mama boot
Slap your baby mama
Baby feel it too
Baby feel it in the womb
Baby baby I’m gon’ win and you gon’ lose
(True)

[Hook x2]

[Bridge]
I’m over seas my man
This life ain’t free, they don’t know
I keep the work on me
So I can stunt on these hoes
These hoes is all on me
These thirsty bitches OD
Yo, why they hatin' on me?
(You gave ‘em the dutchie
That’s a gift my G)

[Hook x2]
