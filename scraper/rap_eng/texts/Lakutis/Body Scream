[verse 1]
These bitches front like they ain't know I was the illest out
Cool J couch, camo hidden in the freaking house
Homegirl said she want me, put it in her mouth
You see them bitches crowd around, you know Lakutis in the house
I'm getting paper like a neighbor on the route
Bad man, see me coming, rush your children in the house
Bar the windows, act up
I will end your life on Foo Fighters with the Mentos
You don't meet no kin folk, you's a crazy bitch though
Doug Funnie with the banjo, eat the pussy like the baby with the dingo
I'm a star like Ringo, I'm a star like Han to my wrist froze out you
Hi boo, how you?

[hook]
Girl, I know you miss the things that we do
You tell me I make your body scream
Girl, you know you miss the things that we do
You tell me I make your body scream
Girl, I know you miss the things that we do
You tell me I make your body scream


[verse 2]

She had the nerve to walk up and ask me "how are you?"
I said, "Astounding, you?"
She said, "Better, now that you around, and you?"
I said, "I'm fine, and you?"
She said, "I'm good, you too?"
I said, "ooh ooh ooh"
She said, "woo woo woo", shit
"That's Living Single, man I watch that too."
She said, "I watch that too."
I said, "Ha ha, that's true."
She said

"Boy, I cannot believe the way you treat me
You have got to change or say goodbye to me."
I said
"Girl, you know you miss the things that we do
You tell me I make your body scream
Girl, you know that I am your perfect lover
I know you miss the things that we do
You tell me I make your body scream."

Girl, I know you miss the things that we do
You tell me I make your body scream
Girl, I know you miss the things that we do
You tell me I make your body scream
