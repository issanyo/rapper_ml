[Verse 1: Lakutis]
9-6 put the dutchie in the color change
Triceratop in the freezer
Never was the same
Push shades, gold dog melt face when you see him
Skeleton whole human race finna feel it
Bitches come a-runnin
Scared like you blindfold
Stuck your whole hand in the grape bowl sucka
See what we dig up
Room sim simmer
Pretty boys finna treat my lung like my liver
Blood get my dick up
Keep my eyes wide
Look deep in the mirror
Funny see a man, but the devil know better
Demon see spitta
You sweet [?]
Talk alot of caca get
Baow in a minute
Get rocked in a second

[Hook X2]
What the fuck now (so what the fuck)
So what the fuck now (what the fuck)
Bitch so what the fuck (what the fuck now)

[Verse 2: Lakutis]
Eyes on the prize bitch
Fuck em who ain't fucking with me
Skeleton rise bitch
Take me back to that McDonalds
Ride in the [?]
Drown in more women
Flow so cold asshole that's a given
Stay HOT for a living, bitch
Mop in a  gutter
Fuck a leech blood sucker
Fuck your life Keifer Sutha
Fuck with no rubber
Catch a batman forever [?]
Stupid motherfucker probably never learned better
Bet you suck a golf ball through the hose if you let him
Young Grim-Reaper dark dream haver
Your mom's panties keep em in a drawer till she want em
Spit acid on a fat motherfucker if he want it

[Hook X2]
What the fuck now (so what the fuck)
So what the fuck now (what the fuck)
Bitch so what the fuck (what the fuck now) X2
