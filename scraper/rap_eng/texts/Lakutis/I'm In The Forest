[Verse 1]
I'm in the coffin
It creaks like Dawson
He speaks like often
He seems like awesome
I'm in the forest
You can find me being flawless
Full moon, ho
Brandy, Mr. Boston
I'm a beast, I'm a dog
You can't see him in the fog
You can't kill him because he's dead
I got bitches on my dick
I'm a death shark, death shark
Scream at me
Walk with me
Sly baby, slide baby
Yay shimmy, ahh shimmy
Shoving every shard of this FernGully VHS
Inside my dick until I see Hexxus
If I had a shirt on, it'd say "free Hexxus"

Wait, wait wait wait wait wait wait
Y'all know about the seven spiders of hip-hop?
Promethalax, Borathazon, Samulus, Zauron, Britetriol
Creep, Jasper, Lytralydon, Zamphexotrorp, Arnarnion

[Hook]
Yo, I'm in the forest
(Chill)

[Verse 2]
Flesh party, flesh party
Only ghost dad at the flesh party
Fast and danger, cast of Frasier
Jewish Keanu
Taste the soup with no spoon, hater
I'm in the loop like fake fruit flavor
Make moves major
Eight blue blazers
Bake roots and play flutes, satyr
They shoot, we slash makeup
Weed slash paper
We stack, cake up (like, like a wedding)
I'm hiding in a laundry
Call me Tom Landry
Call me Paul Anka
Comptroller Carl McCall
Franke till it's sank-a
Swanky at the gala
Jeggings on the treadmill at the Bally's
Fitness
Witness the illest
Sickens the chickens
Like a hawk
Cock of the walk
Top of the notch
God of the Norse
Hang from a noose
Cook like a goose
Move your caboose
Beetlejuice (x5)
Bloody Mary (x4)
Lakutis (x8)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm dead, I'm an alien
My blood got a fang in it
Skull got a jewel
That was wrapped in a rag
It is not what you think
When I scrape off my teeth
I made a pact with India Arie
Ask me if it's blades I eat
Catch me in the cave I sleep
Laughing at the meal I ate
Blood and bones made me
Hold the mic crazy
I don't mean to cuss
But oh, baby
I behold demon money
Lehman Brothers
Kid sisters
Snake mother
Guide your horse to me
Viper skin coochie
Hyper color goofy
I bite watermelon boobies (Yo... what?)
I'm in the house
With the rat with a drill for a face
With the sigil in the splinter in the belly of the beast

[Outro]

[Repeated]
I'm dead

[Repeated]
Death shark
