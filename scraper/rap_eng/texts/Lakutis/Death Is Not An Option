[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz]
I’m from that 456 line, that cocaine brick time
Razor blades rest on my tongue, cutting curfew, shit
I’m from the slums, let me serve you
Real cause my verbal ill, bring the hearse through
Killer papis murk you, Chill
Cold shoulders how I build
Motorola ringing still, with that old flow, Dojo
Chop that work, coco, snowcone, icy
My quarter’s real pricey, hide the crack up in my socks
Now it’s stinking up my Nikes
I got bars, hit this converse, chucking up the dirt
Motherfucker loading SK's, Nahright
Got that bitch like "nah, right?"
Across the jaw, should have paid attention to your blind side
Tanboy, mob life, second coming god like
Spanish Harlem all the way to Wash Heights, love by
Tanboy, mob life, second coming god like
Spanish Harlem all the way to Wash Heights, love by

[Verse 2: Lakutis]
Slap a tooth out a ho mouth
Tell 'em I told you, tell 'em I owed you
See me coming out the bodega with a dutchie and a jumbo Goya juicebox
Looking tight-bummy in my tube socks
Y'all all soft, all off, I go raw dog on a bitch, ya'll go soft
On a bitch, ride till I'm rich, fly as a bitch. (daamn)
Death is not an option, I'll come back and haunt em
Fuck it if they want him, can't see him cause he on one
Bust that ill shit, head explode
Leave that bitch bloody in the road
Me that shit dunny, check the flow
You don't wanna test the water
Death shark, death shark, blood in the water
Fuck your man bitch, look he a goner
He try, he die, he lie
He not like me

[Verse 3: Heems]
Me, me, me, it’s all about me
Mi, mi, mi, mi, that’s a vocal warm up

I'm on that F Train, I'm on that BQE
The best brain, she freak with me, frequently
Everybody love me, I'm Raymond
I'm Tony Bourdain, I don't need a reservation
Okay then, I'm wasted, geeked and I'm spacing
Weed that I'm blazing, and E that it's laced with
Codeine and some K, and we freaking and shaking
My seeds that she's tasting, cream that we wasting
Jesus, I'm Bacon, reach in the spaceship
Green that I'm making, Greece for vacation
Scenes they vacating, keep them placated
Eat and then say shit, the beat that I’m slaying
Is palpably, probably, purposely playing
Seems like it's pavement, concrete solid
Features? of bacon, hole in my heart
That is keeping swaying
Death is not an option, I'll come back and haunt em
Fuck it if they want, ah-ah-ah-ah
Death is not an option, I'll come back and haunt em
