[Hook: Heems]
I'm moving up from baloney
I'm gettin' guap with my homies
We all about the dough, please!
Swate
Getting love from the OG's
Hindu kush by the o.z
You never caught me with no phonies
Swate

[Verse 1: Lakutis]
Asleep in your chimney, giggle in the darkness
Doll that I made from the hair in your armpits
Cut it while you sleeping, staring at you while you eating
Creeping out your cousins at the baby shower talking about
My crystal figurine collection, correction
Cross-section of a disease man, I'm mean man
I let the bitch hair out
Second best rapper with bitch hair out
I let the Jesus freak, I don't even need to speak
Real "squeak squeak cheep cheep feed me!"
Macaroni pictures, unholy matrimony scriptures
Corpse bride, alimony lip-service
Sick circus, insane monkey
Jewfro body-blood-bone-mucus hierarchy
Keak da Sneak baby look-alike party
Frost/Nixon Mel Gibson ascot tie
Ask God why Mary got me
Got dick chimichangas hot sip
Top whip blow fast, slime
Shit, you go Heems, it's your dream
We Greed team, we fiend cream
The lean bean mean machine in my mean Beem
Doctor in my smock...Ock!...Ock!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Heems]
Shall I begin, let me begin
I will begin, so let's begin
They like, Heems, you should rap in earnest
But honestly, I'd rather burn cess and watch Ernest
Goes to Jail, Goes to Camp or even To The Army
Got a sense of humor so they say the kid's smarmy
I eat Cracker Jacks, bump Ratatat
Give dap a dap, smack a cracker back to his habitat
Chief cheeba for my cataracts matter of fact
I drop real facts, call me Snapple caps
And I eat what I like, like Apple Jacks
Creep in the night, streets with a pipe
Skeet when I pipe, in the sheets with your wife
Chief with the whites on the beach til it's night
Out near a very pretty lighthouse
Got a bright mouth and I'm poppin' right now
They like "Ayo, stop this damn guy!"
But our shows from Seoul to Shanghai
Mad fly, nauseous, raucous
Walk it how I talk it, awkward but I'm awesome
This is not a tie, don't abide by the law, son
I'm living single, it's a nineties world
Catch me in a bar with like ninety girls
40 Synclaires, 20 Latifah Khadijah types
30 Maxines that'll probably probably freak tonight
This rap shit is nothing for me
Just another way to be stunting for free
And get buck from burnt blunts with my G's
Blunts with some trees, dumplings & cheese
Something for one king, mumbling, humbling, freeze
Kitten smitten with my mittens disease
Heems from Queens like Prince Akeem
They hopping on one leg barking for me
I'm a Spartan at sparking the tree
Marching with me, Al Sharpton and three
Martians with Jesus parting the sea
I'm starting to see, parting is sweet
Such sweet sorrow, such sorrow
Now bring it back like it's borrowed
Bring it back like it's borrowed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kool AD]
Fresh new SuperCut
Lex, you the best out now with bitch hair
Greedhead this year!
Scott Bakula, elliptical sliding
Bard is too ghetto, I am too Leto
Shout out Sweaty Eddie, drop out the military
All of my people, black, white, Latino
Slave-owning white men said we were all equal
Model minority said "Don't be evil"
Heathrow said we were illegal
Mr. mean Negro Mike Finito on the beat though
Chico Marx, the ego, Zizek's too sexy
Right Said Fred, he's Alexi
KFC Original Recipe is demonology
Gucc boots and Wallabees is modern-day pottery
Only crackers win the lottery
Hackers is a quality film shot at Stuyvesant High School
Am I cool? a young SFJ
Writing haikus, ordering Thai food, watching Hulu, new YouTube
Smooch a dude who's with the "you do you" crew
"True, true, true, true"
Baby guap goo goo, ga ga, Go-go gadget, cabbage
Half-African Erasmus
Peace to Light Magic
Peace to lightness
Yeah, shout out my Palm Pixie
Big shouts to um, my dad's Bluetooth

[Outro]
Y'all, and just a public service announcement: Every time you get those rings on your six pack, you gotta cut 'em up so a dolphin doesn't die, man. Seagulls get stuck in that shit, you know? You gotta do this for the Earth now, man. We're trying to really do this for the Earth now. Aight, peace
