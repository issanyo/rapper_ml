[Verse]
Seven horns, seven eyes, bitch call me Kevin, I
Hit you with the bucket bitch, make Michael Jordan dance
These other rappers swear they raw, close but no cigar
These motherfuckers wanna brawl with the golden God
Bitch you could never get on my level
Ho I been poppin', carve my own
Stone chess piece Tim Robbins
Microphone flow cold, your bitch on it
Homegirl rockin' her some Chinese slippers
Iron Mike tooth with the Brando leather
See your ass again one time I'ma fuck her
Bust one nut, it was time to deliver
Fuckin' with my gods
Peep the fucking demon, and gon' just be what they saw
Hoes be fuckin' geeking when they think he finished
Watch how they applaud when he really finished
Leave him like the golden awkward faces melted off

[Outro]
I want they face off, face off
Face off, take they face off
Where's your god now?

[Hook: Lakutis]
Homegirl rockin' her some Chinese slippers
Iron mic tooth with the Brando leather
