[Verse 1: Nigel Nasty]
What up fellas, haven't seen you in about a year
Now I'm here, we can get it started with some dollar beers
I'm with my brother Lex, glad you brought your lady friend
Looking rather excellent, thinner than a safety pin
Aroused by your features, desire
Tab-oo when I take a look at you, getting higher
By the third song, got the room spinnin'
Finger running through your walls, turnin' it to linen
Shit my lips numb, can't feel my knees
With all the vapors dawg, I'm turning japanese
Nah really I, I really think so
Now you're telling me your brother gotta drink slow
I can't fuck witchu, it's all a roller coaster
I'm rolling on the motion, wanna feel you closer
But I never really got a grasp
Filling up my flask, while I crash on the bloody grass

[Hook]
I've been on a search for all this
Baby I just wanna feel right
Every time I feel it, its true
And I've been in a slump for awhile
You're in my dreams
Get outta my head

[Verse 2: Lakutis]
Yo you and me been together for awhile girl
You make me feel fucking weird as shit inside girl
Plus when I'm with you, we don't ever leave the house
Prolly cause I'm, though, scared to leave the house
I'm too weird to leave the house, look at my hands
What the, fuck is wrong with my hands, yo we should probly
Leave the house tho, nah there's mad cops outside tho
The neighbors might talk to me, some fucking weirdo might talk to me
Fuck it, let's turn off the lights and draw the curtains
It's not even worth it
I don't even feel like a person
I bet I'm mad strong right now, but I'm sweating
Like a motherfucker, plus I'm kinda horny
But if I tried to fuck right now, it'd probly feel like mad bones
And skin and blood and shit and that's weird and shit, shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Baby Gandhi]
Girl, why you trippin' on me?
Just half out back, we was sippin' on tea
The more time I spend with you the more you got me buggin'
But you know what? I love it
Felt you on my tongue, I had to succumb
Now every single thing I say is dumb
When I put you on my eyelids, so you're the only thing
I see, walkin' around the island, that's NYC
When you with me the sun shines brighter
The breeze feels nicer, now I rhyme tighter
Plus music sound just like how sex feel
Sex feel like the X pill, yo that's ill
You got me so at peace, I wonder if this how death feel
You make me feel like I could jump out this window
And fly so high, never ask, why?

[Hook]
