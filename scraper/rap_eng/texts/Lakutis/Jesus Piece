[Verse 1: Lakutis]
I said "Fuck it", when I'm done with this shit?
I'mma spin the whole world on the tip of my dick
Let out the blood from your wrists
Bitch, you ain't fucking with me, skeleton, skeleton

[Hook]
My Jesus piece is my whole body, ya'll hoes chicken like Roy Rogers
My Jesus piece is my whole body, ya'll hoes chicken like Roy Rogers
My Jesus piece is my whole body, ya'll hoes chicken like Roy Rogers

[Verse 2: Lakutis]
Finna wil' out she call out from the bedroom
Titty fall out call out "five second rule"
Beddy bye bitch she love what the dick do
Yup it's official gold in my dental, God in my Brando
Jesus piece is my whole body ya'll hoes chicken like Roy Rogers
My Jesus piece is my whole body ya'll hoes chicken like

[Verse 3: Lakutis]
Look at the fuck have you done
Made a world where the father doesn't know his son
But the drugs let the child know God if he want
Fucker, you lookin' at one, know that you are
See that glow off my body you know I'm a star
Skeleton, skeleton, skeleton, skeleton, skeleton

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Lakutis, Lakutis, Lakutis (x2)

[Verse 4: Lakutis]
Ball so hard make a rock seem soft
Shine like a mothafucka high beams on
Bummy mothafucka made my peace with God
Slide with your baby girl, wild on the mini bar
Fuck what you talkin' bout, bitch, I'm an animal
Ya'll ain't fuckin' with me, skeleton, skeleton
Skeleton, skeleton, skeleton-on, skeleton

[Hook] (x4)
