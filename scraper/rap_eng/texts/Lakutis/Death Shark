(Hook)
I am a Death Shark
I am a Blood Eagle

I am the dung that is rolled by the sun beetle
I am the sun people
You are my sun people
Taste like sun
Talk like people
Proud black people
Think Don Cheadle
Russian, Rico Suave
Ya tu sabe
Jewish Eddie Murphy in your barbershop
Mazel Tov
Molotov
Hot girl, drop it like it's hot (What?)
Drop it like you're sippin' on a Mickey on the rocks
See the Mickey on my watch?
Put a hickey on my cock

Fuck the cops
Take your baby uzi wops and your coupe into a
Coup d'Ã©tat
Haha
While I'm chanting
I sing the body electric
My work of body eclectic
I am the fauna
Hydraulic
I puff the flora
Hydroponic
I mix the henny
With the hypnotiq

(Yo, true. Yes)

(Hook)

Artsy farts
When he turn shit, let's Marky Mark
In the apartment
When the sea parted I was there with no clothes and no toes
Screaming, "No photos!"
Looking like, wild retarded
Soul future
C-3po
Baby, no tee pee
Oh, hey he can use the three seashells
A beached whale attracting conscious young females
With little safari shorts and glasses
But still know how to shake their asses
I remember one year ago I made Caribbean
One broad from the Caribbean is worth like 25 from any other region
Keep dreaming, keep keep dreaming
Keep bleeding keep keep bleeding

(Hook)

My blood is made of bones and other people's blood
My bones are made of blood and other people's bones

(Hook)

(Inhale, get busy)
