[Hook: Meyhem Lauren]
Carvel everything is marvel x4

[Verse 1: Heems
Carvel everything is marvelous
People see me shining and they always trying to start some shit
I'm a fucking problem bitch
See me up in Harlem mobbing with a lot of kids
Got guap like I won the Lotto kid
Got guap, a lot of it
That's why they always follow the kid
Each one teach one, I teach a lot of kids
They poppin' off at the mouth 'til you pop 'em in the mouth
On the queue list they know I was the illest album
I'm in Corona bumping "My Sharona"
Trying to get bread like Tommy Matolla
Oh Motorola, all world that know him
All foes folding, formed before him
Cash that I'm holdin', suits has been spoken
Heems needs some focus, Heems is so hopeless

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meyhem Lauren]
More kicks than armored sneakers shooting the fair one
Divine design shine fly rhyme outclass 'em
Sling saliva bare fruits and Godiva right
Keep a liver height, broke bread with China white
Derelict dialects that special designer type
Fly flows, hit Opa Opa for gyros
Bag a fucking package then buy clothes, your welcome
If a man can't admit his own faults you can't help him
Next scene, peace to my living quarters
On the streets looking wavy like you swim in waters
Splash, my whole essence is aquatic
Move from my past, look back, it ain't forgotten
It's new New York in this bitch, nigga we got it
You only get as much of the script as we alotted
Street olympians and self-medicated measure weight
Hard body heavy hitter floating like a featherweight

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lakutis]
Here comes the fly motherfucker in the hoodie
Blacker than what you see when you die motherfucker
The cutest on the rise motherfucker
Billy Crystal's throwing rocks at your window
Looking crazed from the liquor
Low pro ever sicker but I felt never better
Can't believe I see a man in the mirror
Ask the devil in my mind "What the fuck's with the get up?"
But I fucks with you, baby
By god I'mma show these little bitches how I die multiply
Like a hotstepper, maybe you could do it since you such a mind reader, rottweiler
Jump and bite the fucking throat up out a hater with a gold teether
Crown of thorns on the dome
I'm a Jesus with the features of a demon
Whip a bitch ass so fast
Scientists analyzing what if I'm a feeder, rob and stealer

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Ness]
RBG raggin' on my snap back
Like a scribble on a lap where that cash at
She make it rain every time that ass clap
Tears drop every time that gat clap
She always crying, who, the ambulance
Shots fired, everybody out here doing the hammer dance
Running man, running man, running man
Sh-sh-shooter running down the street with a gun in hand
Heard it through the vine it was over a hundred grams
Four racks in a McDonalds bag wrapped in rubber bands
Now he a wanted man, old west poster
Lost in the moment like Tony on the phone with Sosa
Life's a rollercoaster, Wild Water Kingdom
O.G. said be like water, I be listenin'
Rollercoaster, Wild Water Kingdom
O.G. said be like water, keep it moving man
