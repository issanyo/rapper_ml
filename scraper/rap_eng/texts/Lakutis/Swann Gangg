(Yo, when I was just a little boy
My grandma used to sing me a little song
And it went, and it went like this)

Rap rap music

Silly babies running shit
Silly babies running shit
Swann Gangg, Swann Gangg
This shit is the raw, man
[Hook]
Fuck your favorite anything
You fucking suck at everything
You fucking suck for anything
Nickel, socks, go!

[Verse 1: Lakutis]
Me and D go and the pageantries roll out
The dancers get dolled up
The elephants dub down
The tigers get sucked off
You and your mans get fucked up
The marmosets jumps up and stab a bitch

Catch me slam dancing in the pit
Like Lazarus
Something corny like the industry
Fucked up
The bones have been picked clean
But Myer gets laughed up
(Art)
The point is I'm the man
Just pick up the e-chain

All you little birches get dusted out
Suck it
All you fucking Fergusons my mother fucking sons and shit
Like my name was Clarissa and my father was an architect
Bitch hair, Birkenstocks, everything!

Dead like my father was a carpenter
I ain't have no father why my shit be so immaculate
I'm the richest man cause mines is the purest avarice
Mines is the finest advocates
Picture a fucking tarantula

[Hook x2]
Fuck your favorite anything
You fucking suck at everything
You fucking suck for anything
Swann Gangg genesis

[Verse 2: DVS]
You now rocking with the young John Belushi
I spit shit in your champagne
Cough on your sushi
My sick, sinister campaign
All the girls try to sue me and this
This is a damn shame, so many groupies

Street urchin, market a beast
Up on a fleece, when ya seen him
Seen a marketing genius
I guess I'm open
Told by Serena to peace
But ya'll saw loving
Talking to Venus

It's the DVS, opposite of a Seacrest
Top of the heap, here, playa
Chopping your weak chest
To be the man you gotta beat the man
You need a manager?
Just deliver your pizza man

Top bridges knocking on ya'll bidness
Give me guap that's what Willis is talking about, bitches
(Remember, the show?)
Fuck ya'll if you don't feel this
Swann Gangg was a popular group - and still is

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Lakutis]
I flow both ages
Oh, dope shapeshift
Kevin so blow
With goat rope
With the Oasics

[DVS]
So flagrant
Running the place ragin'
I leavin' the whole nation
Is royalty, bodacious

[Lakutis]
Got the Kiwi Capri-Sun
See, son, each one, beseech one
Beast ball, bitch
Brando apocalypse
Now re-dub
Daddy Warbucks, Mommy Mean Mugs
Hold me on this shit
No refunds!

[DVS]
Piff to the Matrix
Lipton Brisk ass mix
Bitch, get a face lift
I spit liquid amazin'
I drink liquor with bacon
I don't think you can visit my station

[Lakutis]
Screaming keep Yerk out the moon roof
Till my feet hurt
Leaving out the teeth, Burt
Hoop out the Jeep, sir

[DVS]
I'm back on my Deepak Chopra
Relax, I spit the crack that could relapse over ya
