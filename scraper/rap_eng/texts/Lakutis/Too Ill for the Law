[Verse 1]
Look around see the enemies of Allah
Smile like they ain't dead
Look at they gauze
Friends 'til they ain't fed
Look at they jaws
How'm I supposed to rest, dog?
Scared, I'm on self imposed house arrest
I tell 'em meet they maker
Drink a gun butt with a bullet chaser
Figure one less is another one gone
If they could say what they saw
They'd say, "A wild mother fucker too ill for the law."

[Hook]
Too ill for the law
Too ill for the law
Go ahead and snitch, bitch
Spill to the law
Too ill for the law
Too real for the law
All you heard was, "Poppa, don't hit me no more."
Kick in the door wavin' the .44
All I know, Lakutis too ill for the law
Ill for the law
Too ill for the law
Too ill for the law
Too ill for the law

[Verse 2]
One finger salute to the coppers
When I die please CC my PO
Send the deceased to CCCP
Bury me with more gold than C-3PO, Oh
I'll be fine by myself in the ground
Where these cameras can't see me
Though feel me
Yo, gotta be hotter
Esophagus filled with that vodka 'til I can't breathe
I can't see shit
But the demons inside of me were to repent

[Hook]
Too ill for the law
Too ill for the law
Go ahead and snitch, bitch
Spill to the law
Too ill for the law
Too real for the law
All you heard was, "Poppa, don't hit me no more."
Kick in the door wavin' the .44
All I know, Lakutis too ill for the law
Ill for the law
Too ill for the law
Too ill for the law
Too ill for the law

[Outro]
Wild mother fucker
Wild mother fucker
