Uh... yo...
Uh... yo...
It's your boy Lakutis
And the homie SAFE
Fuck it... we take the big vacation
Uh...

[Verse 1: Lakutis]
I like tattoos but not on me
Hoes all on me, Russian Rico Suave
I'm in Puerto Rico probly, Mami order me the salmon
Hollar allí allí oxen hard to find him in a mansion
Damn son, I'm on permanent vacations
Tell her kiss me before the recall boys are racin'
Got in the studio and laced in, it's me and
SAFE kid, it's not an illusion we runnin' this shit, bitch

[Verse 2: SAFE]
Ice bergs and landscapes and nice tits
And fake grapes and planned shit
Like... where the tan line sit
And... who to go to the beach with
Premier apostles swallow
The oxy pills and lobster tails
Little tiny shovels and lots of pails
...

[Hook]
These are things we can both agree on
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
These are things we can both agree on
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
These are things we can both agree on
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
These are things...
(yeah, yeah, yeah, neotropical vacation)

[Verse 3: Lakutis)
Damn that was nice son, looked at you said, "nice one"
Look at this fly shorty's player, wanna bite one
I told her meet me at the hammock, syke one
Now I'm at the pool baby, holler at the next one
... I'm in the Speedo looking European
I flash casinos [?], drunk as hell, I think I'm dreaming
Why? we on vacation, we don't need a reason
Fuck it, I bounce, found some Loko's now we chiefin'

[Bridge 2: SAFE]
Tight ship, but yacht, the boat, night slip
Park and toke, we go beyond
Free on lazy, talk arena [?]
Cool begin to get my sea on [?]
Dreams of the war and the bombs [?]
We excitable boys, we season then they seize on
Blanket kid, be gone
Neotropical vacation
Flick and dribble in a chick [?], while I acquire and
Learn my Klingon, three moons
I'm coming quick, sand dunes
Hot water stick, hot water stick
Neotropical vacation
