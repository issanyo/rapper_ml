[Verse 1]
Hype how
City is nice now
Snow is wiped out
Ice out
Honey’s in tights now
"ayo shorty” dunny just pipe down
Next girl pass can’t lie I’m like wow
Shorties in skirts now
Body is insane
Know that she works out
But I got no game
What is it worth now?
Hurt now so i puff purp down
Everything worked out
Just got out of school I’m yelling yerp out
Take the A to West 4th and I turn south
Spring and sully all the boys got they work out
Girls out
Muttered something would of macked never learned how
As I burn now
Looking through my old journal
Let’s see what I was concerned ‘bout
Let’s see if I remember anything that I learned now
That chapter been turned but not burnt out
Student card got us through the turnstile
Walk through the block like a church aisle
Spirits with me even when we lurk round
We lurk get turnt don’t turn down
Even when we ain't got no crib to turn out

[Hook: Lakutis]
And we can do what you want boo
Drink nutcrackers in the park too
Blow an ounce of the fire
Everybody in my City’s out
All the girls got they titties out
Blowing stacks till they run out
Blowing trees till they run out
Smoking weed cause it feels good
When I’m with you it feels good
When I’m with you it feels good

[Verse 2]
We be in the
Park with a
Fireworks spark it’ll
Start little
Trouble with the cops still
Fucking do it are you moving man
Talk little
Talk less
Speaker bumping off the park bench
All stress gone on to the hard pressed
Issues
Where the motherfucking kiddy pool?
Wiki cool down
Everybody cool now
Schools out
Ain't no reason to get rude now
Ain't no teacher with the stools out
See now we be chiefing on the stoop while
Same street we eating on the roof wild
How you seeing what to do now
Staying in you playing then
If you ain't moving you a nuisance
Blueprint coming out the new whip
Drove by
A-1’s new kicks so fly
No tie
White tee
Coke white might be
Subtle but the most fly
Oh my!

[Hook: Lakutis]
And we can do what you want boo
Drink nutcrackers in the park too
Blow an ounce of the fire
Everybody in my City’s out
All the girls got they titties out
Blowing stacks till they run out
Blowing trees till they run out
Smoking weed cause it feels good
When I’m with you it feels good
