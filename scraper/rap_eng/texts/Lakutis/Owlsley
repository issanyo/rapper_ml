[Verse 1: Kool A.D.]
Yo, I was riding a train
And this Puerto Rican kid said simple and plain "let's battle"
Come to my surprise, a brother's move his eyes on the prize
He said, screw that, I ain't got nothin to lose bruh
Alight let me bust my shit [?]
Hurry up, kid, bust ya joints, and then I'll bust mine
Then I got a be out, cuz I gotta see the sunny set, okay (swag)
"Blah blah blah" is what he said
Then I  came around, just fucked up his head
And this is what I said
I say K, killer, killer, Kool A.D sometimes
Sometimes my words hypnotize me
Spooky, (?), ghoulish, foolish, manish
Thuggish ruggish, raw
What it do?
What it really do?
Get it, fool:
You don't really want to see me do the real
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, boomshakalaka, boom, bibity, bomb da boom, bibit, bibit
Ribbit, sit, English
Oh shit it's really, shit it's really
And I'm feeling like I really gotta get away, gotta get away, get away, get away, any way
Yeah, we do it every day
Buck wild in a shoot 'em up way
Bang bang, then the buffalo sway
Buffalo, oops, sit up on the stoop with a juice
Just lookin', sit up in the kitchen just cookin'
Eat it like a cookie
Eat it like a cookie
Eat it like a--
(Mumbling) [swag, swag, peanut butter, bone bone bone bone, etc]

Express yourself x6

[Verse 2: Lakutis]
Hive mind, flesh body
All I see inside my head: dead bodies
Suicide my guap, 'bout to spend my nightmare
Cornfield filled with the kids with the white hair
My brain, filled up with the drugs and the lab with the fools and pretending John Lennons
Bitch I', John Lennon, dead in Manhattan, doctor Manhattan
Fly away to Mars to a crystal castle
Listen to Crystal Castle
I don't need to see these assholes
I be on the corner playing Cee Lo outside my house
Crack my skull, coke fly out
Drugs go in, guts come out, that's what that twisted motherfucka's all about
[?] like a old bitch she scream "thinner"
So I holla back, "no doubt motherfucka!"
Cops wanna catch a motherfucker
Oh, yo [?] who you, Danny Glover?
Mr. Lover, lover, undercover brotha
Sleepin' in a cupboard, fishy-er than a pantry
This whole world is shadowed, deeper in the rat hole
Find your dead relatives askin' 'bout my rap show

[Outro]
