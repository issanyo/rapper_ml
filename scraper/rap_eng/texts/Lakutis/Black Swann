[Verse 1: Lakutis]

I said my skin stone
My hearts froze

[Verse 2: DVS]

Suckin a vicodin dawg
Cops like what you invited him for
It's "Denying the light of The Lord
You liable to lie in a morgue"
Whose side are you on
Get to the chopper
It's not gonna stop her
The riot is on
You fly with the swarm
Live from the eye of the storm
Lighting the light of the swarm

See me right out your balcony
Ridin the ride of the Valkyries
Smack the shit out of me
Suckas you'll damage your knuckles
You know you ain't fuckin' with
Alchemy no ones allowed to be
Panicky, twitchin'
I'm merrily verily viciously
I spare you da bidness
But obvi ya family vanishes
Smell (a-lotta)? ham in the kitchen
HA

There goes the whole goddamn neighborhood
Stomp with Black Swann y'all not that capable
Naw
Wage war when I walk to the table
And win awards when I'm gone
Your god not available
