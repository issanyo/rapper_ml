[Verse 1: Big Baby Gandhi]
This feast, the meanest, please slurp the penis
Each verse he means it, on the scene on some Queens shit
Dreams big but my surroundings are small
I don't really like my surroundings at all
I hate New York, Queens is a dump
Can't get a real job you gotta pee in a cup
See me I'm what's up, I'm the flyest
Mami, getting sloppy eyes like the flyest hobby
My eye is dry, and the sky is wobbly
You couldn't fuck with me, that's that Gandhi
I'm bugging out, world really got me tripping
Aliz√© sippin', hoes I trick 'em like magicians
Pathetic and stupid, but one with the loop kid
Do what a group did, but I'm not a group I'm a
Person, I'm a cool guy, very cool, fly, never sweat
Look nice in every sweater I get, please suck my dick
Baby SS, please so do it

[Verse 2: Lakutis]
Lakutis, lupus, ill sick, toothless
In jacuzzi's with three Mila Kunis's
You, you couldn't see me like the Buddha bitch
Loud suit with this, I'll show you how to do this shit
You shut your yap and blow a bubble like you Harpo
Groucho, glasses, mustache I make, plus cash, how so
You may ask, ho's I parade they ass
You lay await they ass, rugs that's Arabian
A baby from the 80's, man, damn I'ma ladies man
And kill rappers call me Tombstone
Pizza Pierre I, live in the air, you
Couldn't be there with my priceless heirlooms
Statue of ices there dude, look at it before I peace
You out like ne'er do-hairdo's, who do? you do
I do, icle icle, I nay
What the fuck did I say? What the fuck?

[Verse 3: DVS]
Up live on a fine line between God and the devil
I arrive in a luxury mine car, park on my level
The tragedy partially my fault, Exodus coming
The end of the work's a small job, text me your budget
Blanka but skinnier, the demon sleeps inside the
Basilica BBG and DV peep the Affinity church
People that recently reaching where they speak with a million ears
Lingo, play bingo, 'til really we there (still church)
See I'm like Hammurabi doing Pagliacci
Think I'm clowning' then you bound to get found in a bag of bodies
For manicotti to anything on the plate it probably
Actually am famished, but you ain't catching me acting sloppy
You saw the pasta? they plot on your lasagna
And make sure that you boiling hot for their ?
The threat is mine or I know that my shit is holy
Got my posse on Broadway trying to rig a Tony
You now in orbit with a fellow beyond you
Celibate Bill Bellamy's better be warned
So eat shit, suck dick, go to jail in Sri Lanka
