[Verse 1]
Fuckin' with my gauze
Mumra, I'm a god
I'm a beast, I'm a dog
I'ma rise, they gon' fall
They gon' pray to they lord
I lay waste to them all
I blow seed and I'm raw
They give birth to the world

[Hook]
God's only man, I hear the Earth breathin'
First woman only birth demons
God's only man, I hear the Earth speakin'
First woman only birth demons

[Outro]
Mumra, Mumra, Mumra
Skeleton, skeleton, skeleton
