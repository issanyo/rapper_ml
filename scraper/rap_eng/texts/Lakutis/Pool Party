[Verse 1: Lakutis]
Yo it's your boy, Lakutis in the pool
Hangin' with Mila Kunis in the pool (true)
She said I'm the cutest in the pool (true)
Then she put it on me like I'm Ja Rule
Awwwwwww girl
I'm the flyest aside of the Mississippi
And this side is the side that fucked with me
And Mississ I.P.P.I get me
All my peoples wit' me
All the hoes on me
Audemar, watch me
Ice cold Sake, might blow prolly
I'll never see y'all again but I like y'all a lot b
Just playin', I don't like no-one
See me going dumb like a Shogun
Rap heads blow like Sho Nuff, Ass Dan, dead, I'm so gruff
Y'all bite rhymes, I fight crimes like Batman, Dark Wing, Scruff McGruff

Hahaha, that's wassup
