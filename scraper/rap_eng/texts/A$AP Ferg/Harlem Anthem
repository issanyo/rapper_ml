[Intro]
Harlem
Harlem
Harlem
Harlem

[Verse 1]
Causing ruckus in the Rucker
I'm a beast going straight for the jugular
Like King Kong stepping on what's among us
Scraping y'all off with the feet like fungus
Bricks on a backboard
Then I hit 'em with the sham cause he asked for it
Kriss Kross make 'em jump, Mac Daddy make ya
Then it's all wet just like a Laker
Hi hater, bye hater, annihilator
Ferginator like Terminator, you die a hater
Like Dennis Rodman, you die here
I'm greater than kid saying he's our savior
I can't help it, I'm a violator
You sleep, niggas sweet like Now and Laters
Tell me what you want it now or later
Send 'em on a one way to hell in a elevator

[Chorus]
Welcome to Harlem
Where the legacies are born
Welcome to Harlem
Concrete roses with the thorns
Welcome to Harlem
Come to see where stars are born
Welcome to Harlem, Harlem

[Verse 2]
See the kids on the gates
My opponent staring at my face
Finna put him in his place
Crossover and sober, I’ll make his heart erase (that’s right!)
Can't keep up with my pace
Finna make a movie, this is Liongates
I put that nigga on his brakes
Don't play, just pray, you better have faith
Where Cam and Ma$e play
Pee Wee Kirkland fell in love with the K
I rap like a turban when I'm up in the game
I snap like a serpent, I am all for that change
Oooh-ha, more fire
I've been in truth, the devil is a liar
The fans going crazy in the rises
You know Harlem is the livest

[Chorus]
Welcome to Harlem
Where the legacies are born
Welcome to Harlem
Concrete roses with the thorns
Welcome to Harlem
Come to see where stars are born
Welcome to Harlem, Harlem
Welcome to Harlem
Where the legacies are born
Welcome to Harlem
Concrete roses with the thorns
Welcome to Harlem
Come to see where stars are born
Welcome to Harlem, Harlem
