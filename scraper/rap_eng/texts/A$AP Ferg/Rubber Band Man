[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
You already know what it is, Hood Pope (Killa!)
Dipset (A$AP!)
We runnin' this shit
None of y'all niggas can fuck with us
(Word to god!)

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg & Cam'ron]
Rubber band man got the pocket with the bankroll
Call me Stunna Man, diamonds shining like the rainbow
Runnin' this shit, you can call me Usain Bolt
Yeah, you can call me Usain Bolt
Rubber band man got the pockets with the bankroll
Call me Killa Cam, diamonds shining like the rainbow
Runnin' this shit, you can call me Usain Bolt
Nigga, you can call me Usain Bolt

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Two model bitches with me asking for a sugar-free Red Bull
Mix it with the Tito's now they walkin' with that dead look
Coke up in they nose, that's why their nostrils got that red look
Hip-hop police saw me, jiggy nigga make the Feds look
I just brought a Rollie and my bitches broke the bezel
When you make it this far, certain niggas try to test you
Still live up in Harlem, rich nigga in the ghetto
Yeah, rich nigga in the ghetto

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg & Cam'ron]
Rubberband man got the pocket with the bankroll
Call me Stunna Man, diamonds shining like the rainbow
Runnin' this shit, you can call me Usain Bolt
Yeah, you can call me Usain Bolt
Rubber band man got the pockets with the bankroll
Call me Killa Cam, diamonds shining like the rainbow
Runnin' this shit, you can call me Usain Bolt
Nigga, you can call me Usain Bolt

[Interlude: Cam'ron]
Killa, Killa, Killa, Killa
Killa, Killa, Killa, Killa (in front of the Waldorf)
Killa, Killa, Killa, Killa
Killa, Killa, Killa, Killa

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Yo, in front of the Waldorf, valet said that he's sick of us
I mean he just can't get wit' us
"What's the problem playboy? It's only six of us"
"Yeah, with twenty-five cars, this shit's just ridiculous"
Thought we was inconspicuous
He said, "Yeah right nigga, y'all meticulous"
Twenty-five to life, at one time I was risking it
Ten-digit nigga, old life I ain't missin' it
Look at me, baby girl, you should just lick a bit
Bend down, real low, my zipper come unzipping it
Yeah, I think I really love her 'cause she started kissin' it
I mean, she really started kissin' it

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg & Cam'ron]
Rubberband man got the pocket with the bankroll
Call me Stunna Man, diamonds shining like the rainbow
Runnin' this shit, you can call me Usain Bolt
Yeah, you can call me Usain Bolt
Rubber band man got the pockets with the bankroll
Call me Killa Cam, diamonds shining like the rainbow
Runnin' this shit, you can call me Usain Bolt
Nigga, you can call me Usain Bolt
