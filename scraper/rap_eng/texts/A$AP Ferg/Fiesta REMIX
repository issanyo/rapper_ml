[Hook: Lil Trav]
Now I be cracking and rolling
All my niggas totin'
Got bad bitches with sew-ins, all these hoes be going
Rock Trues, and Robin's, dreads so they jockin
I got the fe-fe rocking
Tron, flats, and molly
Like get money, we spend it, shake it open catchin'
This kush I bring we hit it, Rolling kush I been it
It’s cracking I'm rolling, all my niggas totin'
Got bad bitches with sew-ins
All these hoes be going

[Verse 1: Lil Trav]
Say Sicko what’s popping, ball like the Houston Rockets
All I know is swerve and swag, and tall money is knockin'
And our bullets are so vicious
Got your ass stop wishing I’m on you like a mission
Like a mess is in here, we can’t lose so we winning
That’s why I be grinning I’m popping all the ectasy
My night Is just beginning Rolling stone tatted
Speak country, what’s happening?
These bitch niggas be whining, cause contracts I be signing
My Gucci hat is linen all my hoes they out here get it
On my pimping if you with it
Hope this SK make them ribbit
Till they stop it, bullets hitting
Like Wayne with no ceilings
And we mobbing, mobbing, say Sicko yeah we coming

[Hook]

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
All my homies rising, I be ASAP mobbing
In Miami Colors, chilling with some hoes
All my money powder, all my shoes Italian
Bruh bruh I ain't lying, It's Gucci on my toes
Ksubi all in my clothes, big ass booty all in my hoes
Light skin cutie, supermodel, she ain't worried 'bout my dawg
Girl you 'bout to miss your show, shake that candy out of your nose
Jeremy Scott gon' be mad, why he pay your ass to walk
We about to head to New York, might just hit up Nicki Minaj
Tired of Trinidad and be wildin', But I'm finna have a ball
Can't forgot about Sicko, head to Chiraq and be lo'
Might just hit up 300 for the smoke
Cause OTF can get it for the low

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Ceno]
The hole it be rocking, I got bands in my pocket, and Sicko steady mobbing
Got hella rocks and robins I’m tatted like a Mexican
These Hoes know I be flexing man
I’m on the end no checking in And I don’t do no flodgin'
Out west we be cuttin' though, We see little thots in booty shorts
They hop out in a vino, and you know we be doing us
They hit up the liquor store, Then we hit the fifi up
We bail out and they jocking us, cause my whole team be dreaded up
Sicko and them be Guccied up, Sicko and them be Louied up
Got these bitches going crazy, that’s the word around our town
Big bands in my pocket, I don’t carry no wallet get out my dick
I’m stunting, got the baddest bitches watching
