[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
You can be you today, you can be you tonight
Know you're feelin' really great, it's gon' be alright
I can see it in your face and I know you wanna fly
So get off your ass and create your life

[Post-Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Cause you're missin' opportunities
I know you're rich in opportunities
And you're missin' opportunities
I know you're rich in opportunities
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Workin' in Ben & Jerry's, it was scary
My life vision was blurry
You got talent, why's you here?
I'm thinkin', "Yeah, plus I am gettin' a belly"
I remember mama screamin'
"You ain't gon' be like your Uncle Terry"
Uncle Terry on the corner sellin' rocks
He don't care what you tell him
He a hustler, bad muddastrudda
Ridin' in a brand new Lex when he pull up
He got a hood bitch from the block in the winter
He pull up on her like, "Baby give me sugar, mane"
Man I wish I shoulda, coulda, woulda
Woulda put a hurtin' on her if I hit her with the wood up
She got me dreamin'
When I get outta the hood, I'mma get me somethin' better

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
You can be you today, you can be you tonight
Know you're feelin' really great, it's gon' be alright
I can see it in your face and I know you wanna fly
So get off your ass and create your life

[Post-Hook: A$AP Ferg + Missy Elliott]
Cause you're missin' opportunities
I know you're rich in opportunities
And you're missin' opportunities
I know you're rich in opportunities
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
In VA, where I stay
They don't play, they'll tell you that to your face
Collard greens, candied yams, potato salad
Before you grub, better say your grace
Auntie Jean was kinda mean, but she had dreams
She used to sing like Tina Turner
She said, "Bring my wig and bring my dress
My high heel shoes from a Sunday mornin' service"
Aye, she said, "I'll show y'all beginners"
I'll still whoop that ass with a switch and a splinter
Pray for these tramps runnin' round like a sinner
Missy wanna be a star? Well tell her she's a winner
Ayeeee, she a bad lil' sumn'
Love how she dance like Michael Jackson
Told me I would be number one
Just be yourself, don't be nothin' like them

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
You can be you today, you can be you tonight
Know you're feelin' really great, it's gon' be alright
I can see it in your face and I know you wanna fly
So get off your ass and create your life

[Post-Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Cause you're missin' opportunities
I know you're rich in opportunities
And you're missin' opportunities
I know you're rich in opportunities
Oh, oh, oh
