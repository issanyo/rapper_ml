[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Medusa faces turn me into stone
Versace killers and Raf murdering Dior Hommes
My skinny niggas fuckin' bring the chrome
The only thing I'm killin' is a microphone
Now let my little niggas take you home
One straight to that dome
Betta ring the alarm, Fergy's home
Ever taste the chrome? Way far from a silver spoon
Sing your lullabies, watch your mother and your brother cry
Fuck your sister brains, causin' mental homicide
Motherfuck' your life, fuck your family nigga, fuck your wife
I be down for life (A$AAAP), my brothers for life
Big money, talk to me knots
Talk to me nice or don't talk to me at all
Grippin' that Mack now he grippin' the floor
Ra-Ta-Ta-Tat let it split through your jaw
Laid on your back, whisperin' Lord, bet he couldn't see his death
Berettas under the leather he couldn't see this Tec
Teflon vest for those who test
A bunch of niggas gettin' throwed call me Jazzy Jeff

[Hook]
I got these choppas on deck
And the 9 is on deck
And the llamas on deck
Just in case you ain't heard what I say
I got these choppas on deck
And the 9 is on deck
And the llamas on deck
Just in case you ain't heard what I say
I got these choppas on deck
And the 9 is on deck
And the llamas on deck
Just in case you ain't heard what I say
I got these choppas on deck
And the 9 is on deck
And the llamas on deck
Just in case you ain't heard what I say

[Verse 2]
I'm drowning these niggas, no coroner with me
Invite 'em in water like formula 50
I'm pipin' your daughter, muhfucker come get me
One clip to that brain, gone in a jiffy
I'm poppin' your dame, cum on the titties
Beef lo mein, all in her shrimpy
Oodles and noodles, hangin' out his fitted
Somebody done died, who knows who done did it?
Somebody gon' ride, bang em with the Smith and
Nines men in black, I will Will Smith him
Semi-automat', brattttt it would lift him
Preacher gon' sang, momma gon' listen
He was on that bullshit, Jordan or Pippen
So I had to pull shit, feeling so tempted
Rocks on his socks, Shawshank Redemption
Somebody gon' die, who knows who done did it?

[Hook]
I got these choppas on deck
And the 9 is on deck
And the llamas on deck
Just in case you ain't heard what I say
I got these choppas on deck
And the 9 is on deck
And the llamas on deck
Just in case you ain't heard what I say
I got these choppas on deck
And the 9 is on deck
And the llamas on deck
Just in case you ain't heard what I say
I got these choppas on deck
And the 9 is on deck
And the llamas on deck
Just in case you ain't heard what I say
