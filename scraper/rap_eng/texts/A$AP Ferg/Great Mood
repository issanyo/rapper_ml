[Hook x2]
Got on my suede shoes
Rose gold shades
I'm in a great mood
Monopoly shopping sprees
Got on my cartier
Tailor made black linen
Gianni Versace
Monopoly shopping sprees

[Verse 1: STS]
Okay, I'm high as hell, I'm treetop
Whoop yo' ass, I'm B-Hop
Blow show money at weed spots
And rubberband like G shots
Got a dope flow they can't detox
Cold blood I need heat rocks
I'm chinchillin', you cheap fox
That's fake fur, not fur fox
Bitch I rest when the buck stops
In your iPod or the bus stops
In the background when they bust shots
Word about me spread like buck shots
Nigga I gives a fuck not
I'm photogenic don't dunk shots
I'm independent set up shop
Like a dope boy and it's a trap spot
It's the asshole in the ascot
Who told that bitch get ass shots?
Wanna make money in the A Town?
Bitch gotta make that ass pop
It's the GOLD gang, nigga we don't want half
We laugh while we break down the whole thang
Talk that shit I'm profane
I kill myself, Kurt Cobain
Propelled of propane, I'm gassed up, I'm so vain
I puff pass, I blow Jane, but this shit feel like cocaine
STS you should know my name
That's a shame you don't know by now
I dropped the tape that made the East Coast great
God dammit I was shaking up the underground

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]

[Verse 3: STS]
Okay, stroll up in this mothafucka thirty toes deep
That mean three hoes is with me, square niggas that don't capiche
My credits in the street put my bottom bitch on a lease
And if you can't control that ho, put that bout it bitch on a leash
As I commander in chief with my niggas like naval fleets
Got my Cartiers, Mark Maneres and Polo naval fleece
No creases in my denims, only buy my women Louis
Tell 'em beggars can't be choosy and both bitches can't be bougie
Ha, as I ruly, tell these bitches truly
You'll never find no one like me so bitch you best not lose me
Hookers used to choose me, groupies now pursue me
Blow doobies with me and my band and mates, I feel like Hootie
No blowfish but I do, kill a mothafucka like Fugu
A Town bitch like Nu Nu, Red bottoms on like soo woo
Flow speed up like choo choos, talk hoes out they mew mews
I'm so cold, my crew cool
Gold gang, nigga we rule
