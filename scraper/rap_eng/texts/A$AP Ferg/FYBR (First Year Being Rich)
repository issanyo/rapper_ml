[Verse 1: A$AP Twelvyy]
Yeah, yeah
First year being rich, I'm 'bout to cop a house on Riverside
Checkin' off my list, I buy a boat, I put your crib inside
Mental need a fix, I'm feeling broken since my nigga died
Multiply my chips, I'm losing count, it's hard to memorize
Boost the economy, dollar for dollar, I gotta be
Lit up my neck, hit the lottery
Did it for Prodigy, wilding in Prada oh while I be
Worth in my mind and my prophecy
Coppin these properties, came with a bank and monopoly
Just bought estate in the colony
Bankin' a shot off the balcony, Mob with the Infantry
Rich what I gotta be, nigga

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Movin' stories and walkin' through the clouded room
Not the first time being rich, not the first time seeing shit
Made a promise I ain't going back to bein' broke
First year being rich, now I'mma cop me a brick
(Brick, brick, brick!)
Niggas hittin' bricks, then they shittin' bricks
Fuck your hit and miss, niggas missing hits
Illegitimate at hitting licks
Gold neck full of hidden gems, in the gym, like I'm gettin' ripped
My rhetoric, nigga let it drip, a half a billion by 36

[Verse 3: A$AP Ant]
Top of the year was broke (cash out)
Done been had lint in my pocket
Now I'm plugged like a socket, bankrolls in my pocket
Paypal was on zero, now I'm counting more zeros
Bank account lookin' like Cheerios
With a Mob-like Robert De Niro
Had to learn 'bout grind and patience
Took my moms on a trip to Jamaica
I thought I wasn't gon' make it, I was so impatient
Stressed out, my head was aching, now my palms be itchin'
Now these bitches trippin', now my bank be drippin'

[Chorus: Key!]
Last year I was broke, I ain't goin' back to shit
This my first year being rich, this my first year being rich
Niggas give me dap and these hoes gon' show me, love
I remember what it was, I remember what it was
This my first year being rich, this my first year being rich
This my first year being rich, this my first year being rich
This my first year being rich, this my first year being rich
This my first year being rich, this my first year being rich

[Verse 4: Playboi Carti]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She want to rock with the man
She want to hop in the Lamb', rock with the band
She wanna rock with the gang
Ooh, pop a lil' band
Ooh, I got mo' bands than yo' man
Started from pots and pans to all of these fans
And all these hoes in my pants, ooh, ooh
I walk in that bih', I don't dance, ooh
She drippin', lil' bitch, she don't dance, ooh
Holdin' my dick with no hands, ooh
She coolin' me off with no fan, ooh
Free my lil' guy in the jam, ooh
I keep a drum like a band, ooh
We robbin these niggas, no change, ooh
Then I take that to the floor, ooh

[Verse 5: A$AP Ferg]
I'm already rich but I feel like I'm broke
Huh, nigga, you know
If I go broke, I'ma cop me a O
Yeah, buyin' my uncle a stove
Whippin', whippin', whippin' real hard
Teenage whippin' like he Betty Crocker
She eat the dick up, she the headdie mobster
When the strippers on me, throw confetti dollars (that's right)
When I touch a billion, that's when I'm rich
Stackin' my money, you not with the shits
Hundred on the Rollie and my mom got the crib
They callin' me Tookie, Ice bluer than a Crip
Put the hammer in the Benz cause I'm too legit to quit
Addy caught me chillin' on the Audi with a bitch
Call me Niggarace, each finger, it glists
You try to 2Pac me, I hit you with this, blaow!
