Uh, when I die bring a hundred million roses
Pretty bad bitches making love to my posters

[Verse 1]
In my Cartiers, two lugged teeth
Threw ice in it, so I feel the breeze
Two thug bitches, thinkin about them G's
Who love the hood, they'll never leave
Four model bitches stay popping E
On that booger sugar, rolling up the trees
Spit hella game in her skinny frame
Versace frames, and her dirty bangs
She fuck her friends, then fuck my friends
This story go, it will never end, (it will never end)
It, it, it will never end
And if I die before I wake, I pray that A$AP will be great
My mama good and my girl be late
So there will be another me and the world be straight
Damn that nigga did his thang, he took over and changed the game
His silk shirt, Versace frames, his fly ass bitches
His tight ass jeans, his dirty Benz, his Cuban links
His big ass smile, his eyes is chinked
His brown ass skin, he was looking gold
He really lived, God bless his soul

[Hook]
When I die bring a hundred million roses
Pretty bad bitches making love to my posters
Roses, bring a hundred million roses
Roses, roses, bring a hundred million roses

[Child Voice]
Fergie, Fergie ?

[Verse 2]
Uh, tell that bitch that I'm Fergie Ferg
Remind her I'm rich but never flip a bird
Yes a nigga street, just like the curb
Young Bari high, fucking with the herd
Rest in peace to Selena
I listen to you sing when I'm rolling the weed up
Mix the Cristal with Tequila
Might fuck your bitch but I don't wanna to kill her
I beat that bitch, flash backs to Tina
I feel like Ike when I'm on the mic
And my Diet Butcher, Vera Wang
Vera Wang slang bitches for their brain
And 40 ounce bounce, thug bitches with the fangs
Who fill the block up with cocaine

[Hook]
When I die bring a hundred million roses
Pretty bad bitches making love to my posters
Roses, bring a hundred million roses
Roses, roses, bring a hundred million roses
