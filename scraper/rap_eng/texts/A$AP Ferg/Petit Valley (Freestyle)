[Hook: Bunji Garlin & A$AP Ferg]
Everybody let me see you clap those hands
Come on let me see you clap those hands
Everybody let me see you clap those hands
Come on let me see you clap those hands

[Bridge: Bunji Garlen]
I tell you I have it, Ah tell you I have it
I tell you I have it, Ah tell you I got it
Lord

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
I fell in love with a girl from Petit Valley
She have a tough life but she pretty smiley
We join carnival for the finale
But I want to move to Trinidad keep her happy
Cause she got deported for five years
I swear to God I almost shed a tear when she told me that shit
So I'm back in New York and we talk on the phone
She tell me that she want me back can I keep it at home
I got a growing career can't just leave it alone
It's either her curly hair or the microphone
Girl, oh, what you want me to do?
Trap Lord

[Hook & Bridge: Bunji Garlin & A$AP Ferg]

[Interlude: A$AP Ferg]
Trap Lord in this bitch, Bunji Garlin
We jammin, shout outs to Petit Valley
