[Verse 1]
Victoria Beckham
Talk shit and I dead them
Caskets with them shiny suits I send [?] better
West end crip with a model bitch she gon' giraffe neck 'em
See them numbers on his toes I guess that's when I text 'em
Say hi to the reverend, say low to the devil
Cause its dark as hell and hell is hot so put some coal in the shovel
I be on that next shit, A$AP on my necklace
A$AP boy I'm necklace, now put that on your death wish
My daddy dies when I was 17 three days before my birthday though
I cried once never cried again cause real niggas will never go
My momma wanted to kick me out, [?] boy you'll never grow
But I hoped back on my [?] as I started to get all this rapping though
My fashion so immaculant, Yves Saint Laurant, and Ralph Lauren
And Raf Simmons and Mexico
I'mma a map for sure, I'll mack your hoe
My tat is so A$AP for sure
I'm laughing though cause I'm blasting hoes
All of these white, white bitches got me dancing slow

Double L's dark Yeezys
Dirty bands Versacheesy
Medusa head when it say cheesy
All the pics make the bitches peepee
Harlem boy you ain't know that though
Throw Idaho cause I da hoe
I ride it slow, try to go
Cause I'm on green like a pot of gold
My eyes is low, rent is high, car sitting low
Test a dawg, police a dick, they want to start
Don't even budge PD [?]
Her knees is low, dick is hard
Head [?], shit I'm a star
I need to fuck, a big body guard prolly rush a nigga with a mighty scar
Duff a nigga if he talking shit
Won't fuck your bitch, but she'll fuck my dick
I like 'em tall and mighty thick
Who pussy dope like a fucking brick
Toss that shit from wall to wall
I'm tipped slow I'm Paul Wall
Ghost ride the whip with open doors
Her neck is out with open jaws
Cobra, met a bitch like any kind of cobra
I pop that bitch like a soda
She don't mind I'm a little bit older
I'm out this world I'm in the solar
Hit that girl call me bi-polar
Make 'em say uh no lemon solider
Candy paint when this crew roll ya
