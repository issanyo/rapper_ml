[Hook: Lil Wayne Sample]
Today was a good day, today was a good day
I ain't have to kill nobody, shoot you in your memory bank, memmerise it

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
In my day, you had beef, you went and grabbed the Ruger
We ain't never run on no computers
And we ain't diss niggas on Snapchat
We just snapped when we see m, that's a snap back
Riggerous behavior, ruggid gun stance
All that went Platnom, that was Pun's plan
Mine too, see, I grind too
With my niggas, I be getting money since 9 to
Honorable, stand up nigga, no snitch jacket
Still, gotta belly with a six packet
The hood love me, no surprise
I ain't tell m prommises, I only tell m petty lys
I wanna see m go, go farther
Or get m lined up, like a fucking barber
This slime season, I'm the slime author
Godfather slime, call me the slime father

[Hook: Lil Wayne Sample]
Today was a good day, today was a good day
I ain't have to kill nobody, shoot you in your memory bank, memmerise it

[Verse 2: A$ap Ferg]
Chuggin like you thuggin, nigga, that's what you don't do
Catch a fireball to your head, like Goku
And you couldn't even see me, even if you had my photos
Ain't takin jokes, my block niggas roast you
Hit m with a thousand, right
Fuckin beat his ass, like he o me something
I'm that nigga runnin up the block, you luckey that some my niggas on probation
That nigga t-shirt look like crock
Put a couple holes in his whole face
That's how it goes on the block, ant none those people don't know nothin
Couple niggas knockin at your door
Couple dirty niggas with that 4
My little niggas finna let it go
But you ain't gotta worry bout that dope, cause he bout to do a show

[Hook: Lil Wayne Sample]
Today was a good day, today was a good day
I ain't have to kill nobody, shoot you in your memory bank, memmerise it

[Verse 3: Sanogram]
Sano!
Hopped out the whip, gun on my pocket
Is today a good day, I ain't doing nothing crummy
See a nigga I don't even like, didn't mug m
Tryed to dap me up, I'm like, no way, buddy
Shittin on m, told him he's pretty bummy
Stuntin like my daddy, but I get it from my mommy
You ain't spending money in the trap, you can't come in
Married to the money, can't marry no woman
Ever since a youngin, I've been bumpin that Weezy
From the beginning, my family had a goal, snowglobe like Jeezy
Trappin out the booth, like, what are those, Yeezys
Double park the coope, like it's 4 door season
Tell the honest truth, couldn't aford those easy
Then I got the demans, but the lord don't need me
Had a Hammer in my britches, so the sword not needed
Slice a nigga open like cheese, the Jorno pieces

[Hook: Lil Wayne Sample]
Today was a good day, today was a good day
I ain't have to kill nobody, shoot you in your memory bank, memmerise it
