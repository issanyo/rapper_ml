[Intro]
They mad, they mad
They mad, why they mad?
They mad, and they mad
They mad, they mad
They mad, they mad
They mad, and they mad
You mad, you and you mad

[Chorus 1]
I'm ballin', ballin', I'm shot callin'
Gotta brush the gold grills when I wake in the mornin'
You can smell that champagne when a nigga be yawnin'
And I'm straight shittin' on you cause it's lyrical on it
Got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
I got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
I got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
I got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face

[Verse 1]
I got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
Then I looked at your mama like damn your sons a disgrace
I got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
I'm tryna clean my house, I walkie talkie my maid
I got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
This shit make no sense, I got taste
Girls come to my house to have an orgy parade
I just hit 'em like this and leave 'em horny for days
My daddy said I'm a prince, now I'm a king
He sacrificed and went to Heaven, now I'm livin' his dream
You gotta walk like this, you gotta talk like that
I talked this shit into existence, now my stacks on racks
I got stacks on stacks, stacks on racks
Racks on top of stacks and stacks on top of them racks
Move like that on them cats, you move like that and get smacked
I wipe a hundred on my momma, I'm using that like Proac'

[Chorus 2]
I got a hundred dollar bill to get the bump off your face
I got a hundred dollar bill to get them bumps off your face
I got a hundred dollar bill to get them bumps off your face
Got a hundred dollar bill to get them bumps off your face
Use these hundred dollar bills to get these bumps off your face
Now use these hundred dollar bills to get these bumps off your face
I got a hundred dollar bill to get these bumps off your face
Got a hundred dollar, got damn

[Verse 2]
Now I'm lookin' through the window and the sky's so blue
Lookin' through the window and my grass' so green
Lookin' through my window, hold on I know you
Hollup, is that Adam Levine?
Adam Levine, I got a hundred
Adam Levine, I got a hundred
Adam Levine, I got a hundred
Adam Levine, I got a hundred

[Chorus 1]
I'm ballin', ballin', I'm shot callin'
Gotta brush the gold grills when I wake in the mornin'
You can smell that champagne when a nigga be yawnin'
And I'm straight shittin' on you cause it's lyrical on it
Got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
I got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
I got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
I got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
