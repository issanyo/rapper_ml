[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
All the young bitches wanna fuck a gold mine
Young Rambo, hunnid Glocks hangin' on my shoulder
What the fuck you fuck niggas talkin' about?
You ain't talkin' real loud when the bosses around
Sacrifice you niggas, it's an offerin' now
All you rap niggas turn up with marketin' now?
Till I run up in your house, it's a robbery now
Gimme that advance nigga, devil gon' dance, nigga
Don't make me grab my choppa
You don't wanna see these hands, nigga
Put you in the desert, under 30 feet sand, nigga
I'm the badman, run this muthafuckin' land, nigga
Plant a landmine better watch where you stand
It G ma, hollows gonna fly, it's a homicide
Mamas gon' cry, sing a lullaby
It's about us, never 'bout I, It's about trust never 'bout lies

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
I'm movin' onto bigger things
Big bank take little bank, bow to the lizard king
Took DMT by the DMZ, made peace as the middle man
Then I woke up with a .45, seein' everybody firin' at both sides
We can all dream, till then--
We can all drink, live in fear like Ichabod Crane
I be sick of y'all, fuck 'em all, they do the same thing, not me
Not me, muthafuckas, top three, I cannot be explained
Got the homie Keith Ape with a briefcase and a 38
Lookin' for the nearest currency exchange
Low key, man, I'm gone, took keys to the blonde
Put the D in your broad like "aye, aye"
Couple Gs from abroad, five peas in a pod
Learned to speak in the speech of the gods

[Verse 3: Keith Ape]
Bitch, I'm a zombie
너무 마신 싸구려 코데인
여전히 몸에는 검/흰 camo down
You know we going harder
Than a mutha muthafucking ape
난 욕죠에 누워 쇼핑해
그건 베이프 베이프 베이프 베이프 베이프
키쓰 에이프, 잊지 마, Killer Whale
Killer Whale, Killer Whale, Killer Whale, Killer Whales
수영해 수영해 수영해
우린 곧 돈으로 수영해
너넨 컴퓨터로 구경해
너네 삶까지 내가 주연해
그니까 잊지 마 내 이름, 절대로 잊지 마 내 팀을
잊지 마 절대 내 이름, 잊지 마 절대 내 팀을
한국에서 우릴 잊음 귀를 잃어

[Verse 4: Father]
Lungs full of tar and my tongue out my mouth
Head out the window, your bitch see me out
She open her legs, let it talk like Meowth
It's cryin' oh Father, "boy, please eat me out"
Ride with no tint, I don't hide from no phonk
Come catch these hands, don't confide in no pump
The way I came in is the way I go out
Born in the pussy, I'll die in the cunt
So 'fore you get any ideas and I stomp
A mudhole in your ass, cause I'm straight out the swamp
While the drums and bass go pa rum pum pum pum
And a medley of virgins are humming my song
Exchangin' of smoke, I reside in the lungs
Exchangin' of fluids, reside on their tongues
Fe fi fo encumbered but under none
Father be the one the fi'est phenomenon

[Verse 5: A$AP Ferg]
Fifth of Henny got me goin' ape shit (bow-bow-bow-bow!)
Weed got me wasted
Walk up in this bitch like I'm Asian
Been a minute since I’ve been in Shibuya
Goddamn it been a long vacation
Keith Ape in the cut like Fredo
I'm gon' be alright, better duck when you see his K blow
He gon' take your life (bow-bow-bow-bow!)
All of my ninjas with the 9, A$AP Mob we gon' rep everyday
Underwater squad, yeah, we the killer whales
Finna get wet with the heat when we spray
Fuck all my enemies, you can find me mobbin'
With my ninjas everyday
Nigga, this ain't no industry shit
I be with my niggas from the 143 everyday
