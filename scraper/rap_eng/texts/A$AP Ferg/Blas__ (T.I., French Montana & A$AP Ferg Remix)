[Intro: French Montana]
What up, Ty?
You already know what it is when you hear that hannh
Free TC, free Max B
This that remix, Montana!

[Hook: Future & Ty Dolla $ign]
Ordered up a hundred rosés, need a Benz like blasé, blasé
I'm just, whipping Maserati (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
I'm just, blasé, blasé
I'm just, blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé
Whipping Maserati (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Fuck that blasé, I give these hoes nothing but heartache
Run with killers from Haiti, sak pase
Got my top down on the highway, we running
Do anything but what I say, we gunning
So, you better go on with the woopdy woop
But, shit, the only thing that you shooting is hoops
See when you make music, you exclude the truth
It's hard to tell who's who and you confuse the youth
But anyway, on another day, I'm in LA
With a bitch who probably a thot but too cute to boot
In a big coupe, shorty high as a fool
Moon rock, got her high, doing loopty loops
Chilling with a thick bitch, had to kick back
Made her roll a backwood then she lit that
I'll let her smoke half of it, then I hit that, hah
(Yeah, and then a blunt was next)
Cardio on a bankroll, running a check
We the Bankroll Mob, ain't no fucking with that
And we don't want no excuses we just wanted the stacks
With some rubber bands on it, pull it out a duffle bag
Here, try to pour this shit, you can't
Best believe ain't no breaking the bank
Ain't no shaking me off
Best not put your faith in a fuck nigga cause they can be bought

[Hook: Future & Ty Dolla $ign]
Ordered up a hundred rosés, need a Benz like blasé, blasé
I'm just, whipping Maserati (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
I'm just, blasé, blasé
I'm just, blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé
Whipping Maserati (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: French Montana]
I'm a shooter, Luca Brasi, hundred-fifty on my body
Now Roberta went Cavali, I be pimping like I'm Scotty
I just copped a hundred bottles, got me tipsy, blasé, blasé
Pull up, Maserati, kamikaze, shower posse
Got that Shmoney like I'm Bobby, in that 'Gatti like I'm Gotti
She gon' bust it open sideways, I ain't gotta slip her molly
I'm a don, nigga, hundred on the charm
Get a hundred on the arm, G5 through the storm (Montana!)
Since they gone, don't run up on us, blasé, blasé
I be looking at these jewels, I can tell that's blasé, blasé
Now, she says she got a man, bet she talking blasé, blasé
Cause I met her on a Thursday and I fucked her on the Friday
Montana!

[Hook: Future & Ty Dolla $ign]
Ordered up a hundred rosés, need a Benz like blasé, blasé

I'm just, blasé, blasé
I'm just, blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé
Whipping Maserati (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
Been a minute but I'm back now
I know everybody need me
All this music getting wack now
Ain't nobody wanna see me
To the critics I say blasé
Hating niggas, I say blasé
Middle fingers to you fuck niggas
Why you wanna rain on my parade?
Yamborghini up in heaven now
Man, I promise not to let him down
I'm getting hotter than a kettle now
Oh man, I'm on a different level now
Man, I told these niggas how to style
Man, all these niggas out of style
I'm your favorite rapper, favorite rapper
Even got that nigga dressing better now
Shoutout to all of the A$APs
Me and Ty Dolla go way back
Did a tour with Khalifa
When I used to smoke the cheba
P and J's with the pizza
Had a pocket full of peanuts
Now a nigga living better
Pocket full of cheddar and you wanna be us
(It's true!)

[Hook: Future & Ty Dolla $ign]
Ordered up a hundred rosés, need a Benz like blasé, blasé
I'm just, whipping Maserati (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
I'm just, blasé, blasé
I'm just, blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé
Whipping Maserati (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Future]
