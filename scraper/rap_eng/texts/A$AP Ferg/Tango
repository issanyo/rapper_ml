[Intro: Kanobby & A$AP Ferg]
Makin' money for the long term
Off of these words
Yeah, give me one more, one more
We're gettin' more and gettin' more
We gotta get more, yeah
Make a dollar out of these words
And I'm just tryna find the real words
So I try to find an angle
Yeah I try to find another angle
So we can tango
I try to find another angle
So I try to find another angle
So we can tango with these words
So we can tango with these words
Yeah, real life
Ain't nothing like real life events
Now talk to 'em, yeah

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Just found out my daddy died for the wrong reasons
Wasn't the the kidney that took him, it was the bad treatment
Ain't go to court because our heart was still bleedin'
Family grievin', no money could fix the pain that we feelin'
Lil' nice, done leveled up, you wouldn't believe it
And my momma always reflect when I was younger teethin'
Now it's gold grills glisten every time the teeth in
And all my idols listen every time I'm speakin'
Timbaland and Missy lose it when I load the beat in
My life a party, everyday is a weekend
I swear my whole life changed last weekend
But this game strange, it'll throw you off the deep end
Speak to Yams' mom on the daily, beautiful lady
Feelin' of her losing her baby drivin' her crazy
She say that I remind her of her son
She make arroz con pollo and cook every time I come
I get the 'itus, she tell me to go sleep in his bed
And maybe some of Yams' visions come to your head
Life's a dream, momma knew that I was somethin' special
Never settled, tunnel vision, pedal to the metal
Momma in first class, she actin' all boujetto
Now it's PBS specials, thought I was too ghetto
Singin' Christmas carols with Miss Universes
She slide me her number, you know Fergie gon' put the work in
Re-real life, I be livin' out my verses
Reflect when Dove ran out, I used detergent
The one you clean dishes with
And now we at award shows all gettin' lit now

[Chorus: Kanobby]
Sometimes I like to tango, tango around these words
Dance all around these words
If I don't speak, it might get worse
If I don't speak, it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango, tango around these words
If I don't speak it might get worse
I'ma dance all around these words
If I don't speak, it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Sometimes I like to tango dancin' with these words
But I can't accept my thoughts so it's gettin' worse
I gotta let it out or my brain'll burst
I'm busy tourin' so I can't go to church
The only option is put it in the verse
Express it to my fans so they be alert
Yeah, Fergie put in work, Fergie put in work
I wonder if I gave it up, would I miss the perks?
Would I miss the groupie hoes with the short skirts?
Would I miss these rapper niggas? Nah they all jerks
Some I came up with, don't desire to speak to
Fake hugs and love every time when they see you
They scream "R.I.P. Yams" and that's just to please you
But his mom know what it is, just know that we see you
I got the heart of a lion and the eye of a eagle
I gotta speak the real, it ain't no time to tango

[Chorus: Kanobby]
Sometimes I like to tango, tango around these words
Dance all around these words
If I don't speak, it might get worse
If I don't speak, it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango, tango around these words
If I don't speak it might get worse
I'ma dance all around these words
If I don't speak, it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango

[Outro: Kanobby]
Dance all around this words
If I don't speak, it might get worse
If I don't speak, it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango, dance all around these words
Dance all around this words
If I don't speak, it might get worse
If I don't speak, it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango
