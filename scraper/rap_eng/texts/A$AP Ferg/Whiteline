Ferg:
All these damn mosquitos

In puerto rico
Fighting a mosquito
Met a stripper bitch that got an ass full of nino
Canâ€™t go a day without a drink or a kilo
She on a fish scale, now she finding Nemo
I ain't gon' lie, she a fiend on the D-low
The bitch took a brick to the face like Debo
Or Al Pacino, point the Desert Eagle
Busting everybody in the mothafuckin D/O
Welcome to my little little friend
Writing white lines with a little little pen
Spitting riddles and fiddles that kill you to the end
You slit in the middle, you skittles little man
(your girl sniff it off the pickle in a little benz)
You mad cause you see us through the little little tint
And that made your ass a little little tense
Dump him in the water and give him a little rinse
Can you swim?
No
Ain't no fucking body, that's surviving through the flow
Im collecting bodies like tsunamis when i flow
I be catching hommeys like a zombie when i flow
Sippin' Pina coolada's with models on the boat
I be getting dollars, holla if you broke
Holla if u broke
All these bitches on our blow

Chorus:

She like that  cocaina sniff it off my banga' (sunshine)
She like that  cocaina sniff it off my banga' (whiteline)
She like that  cocaina coca cocaina sniff it off couple model bitches
Twerk (sunshine all of the white lines all of the whiteline) x2
