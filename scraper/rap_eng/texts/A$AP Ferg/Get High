[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Hey lady, got something for you to buy now
Something cool, something new, something for you to try now
I know you feel alone, but I'm gon' get you high now
Now that you high, take your clothes off, and lie down

[Hook]
We get high (She said)
We smoking reefer, got her open, now she hoping
We get high (She said)
We smoking reefer, I got her sipping, now she tripping

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Come, listen, yeah I can be your E-pill
Better yet your He-pill, when it come to tricking D-pills
She say that my pipe is crack and you know I'm gon' get very ill
So I just penetrate and hit her with my needle
She need ill, to stay alive, keep my crack in between her thighs
When she smoke she feel her high, delicate enough to make her cry
(I think she need new lungs, cause my bitch she get)

[Hook]
We get high (She said)
We smoking reefer, got her open, now she hoping
We get high (She said)
We smoking reefer, I got her sipping, now she tripping

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
I can be your pusher, know you need your pusher
Get it how live it when you know you need the hook up
I can get it cook up, know I got you shook up, ooh
I'm your pusher, but I don't be on no corners
Put me in your nose, inhale my aroma
Shit so potent, shit stronger than ammonia
O.D. and fuck around and slip into a coma

[Hook]
We get high (She said)
We smoking reefer, got her open, now she hoping
We get high (She said)
We smoking reefer, I got her sipping, now she tripping
