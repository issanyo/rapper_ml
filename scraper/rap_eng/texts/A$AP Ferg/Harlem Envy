[Verse 1: Perrion]
Harlem nigga on the rise
This shit come easy, I don't even try
I just seperate from the fakes, two face
Want to smile up in your face and tell a bunch of lies
Nigga fuck that bullshit
I'm on the cool shit
I know niggas who always keep full clips
Keep that tool equipped for you shit heads
No chlorine; clean them out like some pool shit
Don't believe? Take a visit to my town
I know OGs that hol' the block down
I been around; I seen it all
My niggas' records ain't clean at all
Never told a lie, I mean it all
Nigga pass the Moe, I'll drink it all
I don't give a fuck what you think at all
These gold digging hoes get no cream at all
My team is strong; home team
Raider Clan, A$AP right by my side
That pretty young thing be moaning
She a bad bitch who would ride or die
No E-V-E but she’d peep the G
Now she fiending, want to creep with me
And she love the D, when I give it to her
But still slut, you get no fucking mula
Slick with the words I’mma fucking ruler
Niggas cold with the flow we be fucking cooler
Get on stage, bet they fucking boo ya
Fake niggas, I can see right fucking through ya
Had to catch my breath
Carrots, poison, pearls keep me fresh to death
We getting it and you getting nothing
And that’s real shit, Why y’all niggas fronting?

[Hook]
I'm camo down to my boxers, gold teeth, a bathing ape (5x)
It's animals in my projects like monkeys, orangutans

[Bridge: ASAP Ferg]
This is muthafuckin' D-Ferg
Reporting live from the muthafuckin' B-side
Harlem world where the G's ride
Sippin' Henny, smoke a blunt, you know we be high

[Verse 2: ASAP Ferg]
Sippin that dough, get a smack tho
Similac ho wanna suck on my balls
Semi-mac go though, oh look it they know
Let his brain go, in Durango
Through his Kangol, David Blaine ho
Disappear if you talking that shit
Spit a motherfucking clip through your motherfucking hip
Hammer in my pants, I'm too legit to quit
Moving, I clear through your crib
Fifth move the couch and the room'll get big
I don't give a fuck if a tomb in your head
Home improvement, this nigga got fixed

[Verse 3: Slim Dollars]
Uh, Slim Dollars, smoke some bitch, light up

Is you catching what I'm throwing, pick it up like stripper money
Slim Dollars, Hug Hef swag looking bunnies
I’m in the grotto, trippy is the motto
Pop a few purps, bitches sipping on my bottle
I’m not a role model, not the nigga you should follow
I hope they get the point like a tip on the hollow
Mark Jacobs in the flesh, baby blow me like a breath
I don’t need support like a pair of fucking breasts
Strapped like a bra put your animals to rest
Veterinarian, yes we are scary and
My weed red niggas gonna trip their heads on that
Y’all acting like bitches, I swear I got bitches
That get more bitches than you bitches
You riding trill wave, when these niggas going fishing
Give them the hook, you niggas know I’m gonna finish
I give them the hook, these niggas know I’m finished

Actually, got the city on the map
Go them running on the track like subway raps
Got love for the trap even though I’m in the rap
Like fat lady backs I’m familiar with the crack
Where they at? I’ll tell you where they been
If you ain't been around I'm blowing by you like the wind
Chicago with the breeze, I'm chilly without the cheese
And if Santa working I'll spit a hunnit degrees
