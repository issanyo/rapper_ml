I've been killin' shit since I've been on with Fergie, holy moly
Lord have mercy for me, can't get hold of me, I'm ridin' doly
Fuckin' frauds, tryna hit me with the okie dokie
All I see is [?] like I'm [?] from Jersey
Ain't with the bullshit, I be really tryna catch a plug
Your bitch a ho, my nigga skeet her like she roll it up
No friends in this, just the ones I grew up with
All about the money, you can miss me with that stupid shit

[Pre-Hook: Crystal Caines]
When you glow up then you blow up
They all show up with hands out
We grind for hours every hour

Poppin' pussy, she be poppin' pussy, pussy, pop that crotch
Crew, hop in hoochie, hop in wild like it's hopscotch
Hit the bank with it, only time I hit my hotline
I've been on, now we be grindin', gettin' to it nonstop
I ain't with the names, I tell that nigga that he gotta go
Call a Ãœber, tell the driver, "Take this dumbass nigga home"
Heart is cold, I be ridin' 'round with cheese, that's not yours
Friends come and go, if you fuck with me, if not then adios

All of the homies, they blowin' trees
Smoke good, put it in the air
They say no smokin' weed
Fuck them niggas, we don't really care
Nigga I don't know you
Don't know why you standin' here
Chillin' with my whole crew
And my niggas do damage, yeah
We on that fuckery
What about all of the bitches that used to be duckin' me?
All of a suddenly
They fuckin' with me, wanna take sips of the bubbly
Pockets so bubbly
Come fuck with a G, all the girls leavin' the club with me
Climbin' that money tree
I gotta get cheese, really no time for the cuddling

[Bridge: Crystal Caines & A$AP Ferg]
Pop that pussy for a real nigga
Pop that, pop that pussy for a real nigga
