[Intro]
Gentle Jesus, meek and mild
Look upon his little child
Pity my simplicity
Allow me to come to thee
Lord Jesus forgive me for my sins
Make sure that you take care of my family, my mom
God bless my dad
Look over me and my niggas, Amen

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
A$AP murder clan, ride with the mob
Twinkle in the eye cuz you ridin with a star
Rebel all black and we dyin' for the cause
Keep your hands down when you talkin' to a boss
See Lou Banga ridin' in a Porsche
Bet that nigga teeth look better than yours
All gold slugs and I don't need to floss
Young Trap Lord, might die on a cross
Gold link chain swing down to my balls
Bout to rule the world, gettin' signs from the Lord
Lord say "Ferg, damn you my boy
Wanna be on top? Nigga, it's your choice"
I don't give a fuck, I'mma ride with my niggas
Right on the block, gettin' high with my niggas
High to the sky, puff lye with my niggas
Drunk drive with my niggas, I'mma die for my niggas, uh

[Chorus]
I'ma ride for my niggas
Tote crime for my niggas
Pull a 9 for my niggas
Drunk drive with my niggas
Get high with my niggas, uh
Provide for my niggas
Get high with my niggas
Puff loud with my niggas
To the sky with my niggas
I'ma die for my niggas
I'ma ride for my niggas
Tote crime for my niggas
Pull a 9 for my niggas
Drunk drive with my niggas
Get high with my niggas, uh
Provide for my niggas
Get high with my niggas
Puff loud with my niggas
To the sky with my niggas
I'ma die for my niggas

[Verse 2]
Get in your skin, like a dermatologist
Bunch of dirty niggas who ain't never been to colleges
Fuck your hypothesis, I be on that rider shit
Bang him over the head, I bet that shit'll silence him
Margiela stallion, bitches be Italian
God pray for me, I know my daddy smiling and
I'm gon make you proud, save me a cloud and when
I make it to heaven you'll be by my side again
Bless all my violent friends, they don't know right
All they know struggle pain all of their life
Washing down pain with that purple and Sprite
Murder death kill nigga fuck your side
Uh, cause D Ferg got the fuckin' toast
Uh, cause A$AP fuckin' do the most
Uh, with the 9 in my 40 Belows
Ridin' to the club with a snub nose

[Chorus]
I'ma ride for my niggas
Tote crime for my niggas
Pull a 9 for my niggas
Drunk drive with my niggas
Get high with my niggas, uh
Provide for my niggas
Get high with my niggas
Puff loud with my niggas
To the sky with my niggas
I'ma die for my niggas
I'ma ride for my niggas
Tote crime for my niggas
Pull a 9 for my niggas
Drunk drive with my niggas
Get high with my niggas, uh
Provide for my niggas
Get high with my niggas
Puff loud with my niggas
To the sky with my niggas
I'ma die for my niggas

[Outro]
Our Father who art is in heaven, hallowed be thy name. A$AP. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory
