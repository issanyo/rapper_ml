[Verse 1]
When my daddy died I went through deep depression
T Ferg was on the run, he was a felon
My uncle dipping T up in the cell and
He was in them shackles since an adolescent
Now he out them jumpsuits and that's a blessin'
When it's tough I tell him never get discouraged
I'mma take you out the hood, uncle, don't worry
And now he first class at different telly's
And he love that shit, nigga love that shit
Cause your nephew made it
Now we on them tourbuses, getting faded
Eight band in that sock, fucking Asians
All she know is sucky, suck, fuck what I'm saying
I hope this cock'll fit, that's what I'm praying
And baby if you hear this song I'm playing
Japan was fun as hell, all that I'm saying
Kawaii to my pretty Asians
Shout outs to my mama, rest in peace to my daddy
Shout outs to uncle T, I'mma put you in a caddy
Shout outs to Pretty Flacko, Yamborghini and Jabari
I'mma let y'all ugly niggas know I love you

[Interlude]
Ain't no rewards for that
Ugly ass niggas, I love y'all
Yeah, ain't no rewards for that
I swear

[Verse 2]
That verse right there, was for my momma
Shouts out to the lady, I'm thinking you did it
She grew me and raised me and tutored me daily
Cause school was crazy
And who would've knew that Ru would've made it
The blueprint you laid it and we conversated
Heated and debated on what I would do if school didn't make it
I dropped out of school and ooh you hated
You didn't want me to look foolish, nigga
Who would be bigger than Yohji Yamamoto
Fendi and Versace, blue is her favorite
You didn't want [?] to take me
I get it, you didn't want to lose your baby
But now your friends say ''who your baby?
The one with the crew and them dudes is crazy''
Especially Marty and Lou be hazy
Illy be smoking like two in a day
