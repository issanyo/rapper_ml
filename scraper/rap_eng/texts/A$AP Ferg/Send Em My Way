[Chorus: Marty Baller]
Send 'em bad bitties my way
Send 'em bad bitties my way
I want a house with a lake
And it better be in LA
Send 'em bad bitties my way
Send 'em bad bitties my way
Couple bitches you can play
Couple rooms you can stay
Send 'em bad bitties my way
Send 'em bad bitties my way
I want a house with a lake
And it better be in LA
Send 'em bad bitties my way
Send 'em bad bitties my way
Couple bitches you can play
Couple rooms you can stay

[Verse 1: Marty Baller]
Send 'em bad bitties my way
And I know they're wearing lingerie
I'ma sing like Marvin Gaye
She gon' do everything I say
Send 'em bad bitties my way
I ain't got that long to stay
I ain't got no time to play
You gon' take this dick today
Send 'em bad bitties my way
He gon' leave and I'm gon' stay
Ballin' on 'em, Dr. J
While I'm smokin' on a J
I'm in Cali and LA
Chillin' with Dr. Dre
Drive around, goin' crazy
All you niggas a disgrace

[Chorus: Marty Baller]
Send 'em bad bitties my way
Send 'em bad bitties my way
I want a house with a lake
And it better be in LA
Send 'em bad bitties my way
Send 'em bad bitties my way
Couple bitches you can play
Couple rooms you can stay
Send 'em bad bitties my way
Send 'em bad bitties my way
I want a house with a lake
And it better be in LA
Send 'em bad bitties my way
Send 'em bad bitties my way
Couple bitches you can play
Couple rooms you can stay

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Send 'em bad bitties my way
I want a bad bitch with the cake
She fuck 'round and sit in my face
Car goin' fast, hittin' the brakes
Send 'em bad bitties my way
I want the big house with the lake
Pockets fat, lookin' like Rickie Lake
You dive in that pussy, you swim in a lake
Send 'em bad bitties my way
I'm finna cop a mansion in LA
Dippin', dodgin' in a Phantom where I stay
Grill so cold man it freeze up my face
Send 'em bad bitties my way
I brought the Lambo today
I'm goin' Rambo today
Don't touch on me throw AK

[Chorus: Marty Baller]
Send 'em bad bitties my way
Send 'em bad bitties my way
I want a house with a lake
And it better be in LA
Send 'em bad bitties my way
Send 'em bad bitties my way
Couple bitches you can play
Couple rooms you can stay
Send 'em bad bitties my way
Send 'em bad bitties my way
I want a house with a lake
And it better be in LA
