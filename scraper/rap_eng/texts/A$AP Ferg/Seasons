[Intro - Sebastian Mikael]
It was love in the summertime
Just like the seasons I come and go
Now I don't feel the same inside
And you deserve better than this
It was love in the summertime
Like the seasons I come and go
I don't feel the same inside
And you deserve better than this

[Verse 1 - A$AP Ferg]
Never knew I'd break up with my sweetheart
We met in junior high school, had a sweet start
First chick I ever met had a mean car
You was my upgrade, I had to reach far
We would roll up in yo' Lexus with the system blarin'
And you always tongue me down when them bitches starin'
We took our love to the heights, never no comparin'
Thank you love for sharin', our love is disappearin'

[Verse 2 - Sebastian Mikael]
But I won't be the one by your side
I come around in your darkest hour and
I won't be there for you full time
You can't trust me, trust me
I ain't built for this (oh)
Girl you wastin' yo' time (echo)
Tryna find a different side of me
Finally got you blind (for real)
Can't change me, you'll just end up hurtin'
No I don't gets better with time
No I don't gets better with time
No I don't get better with time, oh no
I-I-I-It was love in the summertime
Just like the seasons I come and go
Now I don't feel the same inside
And you deserve better than this

[Verse 3 - A$AP Ferg]
Love
Can't believe she came to the crib
Had the bitch in my shit she was looking like "Why"?
Caught me red-handed, I sat there just starin'
This not how I wanted to part
Thought about all of our loving
I'm getting beat down from the beat from my heart
Now was no turnin', like Usher I'm burnin'
I feel like I'm walking on Mars
Breaking her heart, foreign cars, broads, it's makin' it hard
Damn it don't know what I'm doin'
My mama told me to kneel and pray to the lord
Ahhh
And yo' body look like art
But can I be with you now

[Hook - Sebastian Mikael]
I won't be the one by your side
I come around in your darkest hour and
I won't be there for you full time
You can't trust me, trust me
I ain't built for this
I won't be the one by your side
I come around in your darkest hour and
I won't be there for you full time
You can't trust me, trust me

Like the seasons I come and go

Like the seasons I come and go
No I don't gets better with time
No I don't gets better with time
No I don't get better with time, oh no
I-I-I-It was love in the summertime
Just like the seasons I come and go
Now I don't feel the same inside

[Outro - Sebastian Mikael]
It was love in the summertime
(Faded) It was love in the summertime
