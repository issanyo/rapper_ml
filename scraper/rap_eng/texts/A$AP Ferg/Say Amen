[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Heard them niggas can't eat in your bodega, huh?
Down and out, now the Trap Lord is your savior, huh?
Fully loaded banger, let it rip through your cranium
Papis catching bodies, riding with Jose and them
They carry ammunition, blaze at them
Just the same old mission, light 'em up, spray at them
Cocaina and your women, you done made a sin
Trap lord'll forgive a nigga, just say amen
Say amen, say amen, say amen, say amen
Trap lord'll forgive a nigga, just say amen
Say amen, say amen, say amen, say amen
Trap lord'll forgive a nigga, just say amen

[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz]
Yo, I sold drugs cause I wanted to rebel
Mom gave enough but enough wasn't well
Prayed I'd stop, on both knees
Slow down Bobby Valentine
Before I had bars before I had a sale
I was in a cell because I made sales
Pops flipped out, still made bail
Still smoked up still coffin to the nails
And the coffin six feet
Trap Lord I'mma practice what I preach
Got a son got a nephew got a niece
In the kitchen made a cocaine feast
What the fuck you expect gotta pay rent
Burn benjamin franks on fake friends
With they hands in but they time's out
I seen dead bodies I could lie bout
All my whereabouts
Drug shit was my money route
Will I go to hell?
I ain't tryna find out
So I need forgiveness
Holy water sippin'
Holy Mary missin' in my life
In the club sippin'
Blood money spendin'
For the love of Bolivian white
Give me some advice

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
They never turn into salt
Them demons creep in your head
Put your soul in a coffin
I can't believe that he dead
Your soul'll be higher than Friday
With Smokey beamin with Craig
Better not sleep on the evils
Grim reaper leap in your bed
Gotta pull that nine if you gotta
Fill that body up with lead
Cause he gonna come after you
If you don't hit him in the head
Bullet hole up in your crib
Baby momma holdin' your kid
You don't want no blood on his bed
You better say you a prayer
