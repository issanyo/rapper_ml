[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
Uh, feel my heart beating
Uh, feel my heart beating
Uh, feel my heart beating

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Ah, Daddy has flown to paradise
He was on dialysis
Life was harder than calluses
Needed a drug, so I'm smoking on cannabis
Loving them bitches you tempered with
Probably the same bitches you and your man done hit
Bari told me that she was a ho
That pussy, I couldn't abandon it
I was on drugs, we high
On the Summer Jam stage
Eating off a cloud, high off the haze
Feel like I was floating for about a hundred days
Now I'm texting a couple bitches hoping I'm getting laid
Couple of bird bitches, a pelican [?]
Ain't fucking text back, oh, now I'm feeling played, oh damn
Yams said "Ferg, you don't look good"
Cause I'm high, I'm so high
Time has flown by
My eyes, they don't lie
Where the fuck is Lou? I'm trying to be polite
I think he laced me, I'mma chuck him like bowtie
Oh, he shall die
Or Percy probably gave me a coke high
Coke in a blunt, nigga, what a surprise

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
All these voices in my head
Voices in my head, head
Voices in my head
Voices in my head
All these voices in my head, head
Voices in my head
Voices in my head
Voices in my head
Voices in my head
Voices in my head
All these voices in my head, head

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Oh, lots of thoughts running through my brains
Don't want to be caught like Kurt Cobain
My mind's a Porsche, switching lanes
All of a sudden I'm feeling all of this guilt and pain
Kids is dying from drugs they buying
Popping a molly, get feeling like Iron Man
Shit is like lighting a fire inside of them
Fuck is you thinking kids trying to get higher than?
Higher than Mars, killing ourselves cause we live in a fucked up environment
Dreams of becoming doctors and firemen
Shouldn't give in to these early retirements

[Chorus]
All these voices in my head
Voices in my head, head
Voices in my head
Voices in my head
All these voices in my head, head
Voices in my head
Voices in my head
Voices in my head
Voices in my head
Voices in my head
All these voices in my head, head
