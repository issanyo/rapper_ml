[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
She questioned my lyrics
My love for your music is bittersweet every time that I hear it
Your great-sounding art helped build my walls
And pushes me away so I won't fall
I'm thinking in my head "shit, oh my lord"
She texted me last night with all my faults
Downloaded your mixtape, it sound so good
But why you gotta say things that make me sound so small?
You talking 'bout your experience with other women
How you think that be looking?
My daddy and whole family hearing
Where's the respect? I don't feel it
And if you lose me, would you fear it?
Would you take back the silly acts that you was sharing?
About how you deceived and cheated with no caring
The honesty in your music is fucking overbearing
I feel you, babe, I understand where you coming from
Just hear me out, just understand where I'm coming from
I'm not dumb, I know what I write
I don't wanna hurt you and I hate to fight
I'm conscious of everything I recite
Cleanse the soul through fingertips when I write
I don't really know if it's wrong or right
I feel like God put me here to shed the light

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
You ride for me
You lie for me
You would die for me
And you cry for me
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
My open letter to my girl who got my back
Who's affected by the real shit in my raps
What's that name of the song, the Jay Z track?
I was just fucking them girls, I was gon' get right back
Still tryna figure my place in this world
Ain't mean to hurt the heart of my beautiful girl
See, I talk about the real so my niggas'll learn
Try give 'em motivation so my niggas'll earn
So I talk about how I shine and fuck on dimes
Rolling in the Maybachs, seats reclined
I know it sounds kinda harsh when I speak 'bout mine
And you'll be crying in the dark and wanna leave sometime
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
You ride for me
You lie for me
You would die for me
And you cry for me
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years

[Outro: A$AP Ferg]
You ride for me
You lie for me
You would die for me
And you cry for me
