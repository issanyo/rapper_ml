[Verse 1: A$AP Twelvyy]
Got it by my lonely now my speakers knocking
Pull up with that money, ain't no window shopping
Broke is not an option, know we get it popping
Playing with my money then that heater popping
Mozarella, money like a Rockefeller
Hundreds in the sky propelling
Hundreds in my ride vanilla
Marvin in some hotter weather
Ain't no body got it better
Hundred million gotta' get it
You ain't know I gotta' tell ya'

Provolone, fetti, the dinero, the guap
Money in the bank, money in the shoe box
Crop the top off when the weather get hot

Ball in this bitch like I'm Horton
Probably rocking them Jordans
'Cause Coachella [?] performing
Got your bitch on camera recording
Take a flight to Africa
Broke boy we laugh at ya'
AK leave a massacre
I'm at the bank teller
I need all hundreds (Cash out)
I need all fifties (Cash out)
I don't want your twenties
Your money looking funny, counterfeit

I'm getting the fetti now give me the guap
My diamonds is doing the tall walk
My diamonds dancing like it's Carlton Banks
I wanna be like you uncle Frank
Frank Lucas with a bunch of moolah
Grab the tool the size of a ruler
Hit a nigga (Bop!), do it to ya'
He got an eyepatch like he Rick the Ruler
That's how I'm feeling, this cap will go right through ya'
Right through ya' jacket he gon' holler [?]
Screaming hallelujah, Ruger remove ya'
[?] nigga that's how we do it
[?] dinner man, straight from shabooya
I want a cougar to give me the moolah
Finessing, finesse homie that's how I grew up
Sit on the stool with the gun and the cooler
