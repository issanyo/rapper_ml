[Intro]
Yeah
Uh
Yeah, uh
Uh

[Verse 1]
I said, "My mama"
My mama always taught me
In and out with a shawty, she beat me for actin' naughty
And my daddy, my daddy, he a savage
Fuckin' bitches, the baddest and buyin' whips to just crash 'em
And my uncles, my uncle, one name is Psycho
T-Nice cooked the white slow, thank God he ain't do life though
And my grandmas, my grandma, one hit the hammer
One and them dressed like Hammer and was an African dancer

[Chorus]
Family tree
Yeah, family tree
Bring it back
Yeah, family

[Verse 2]
I hate it when my mama curse me out in the public
My daddy had the silver mink matchin' the Benz
T-Nice introduced me to some killers for friends
And Pschyo was a Pschyo with a deuce in his Timbs
My grandma had the arthritis, holdin' the hammer (Yeah)
She kept it in the mattress, kept my unc' out the slammer
The other had a caesar with some pants like Hammer
She kick her legs up, she a African dancer

[Chorus]
Family tree
Yeah, family tree
Yeah, family

[Verse 3]
Life's a tightrope, the fam give me balance
With me as I climb the mountains of the rich and the the famous
Grandma, holy moly, she dancin', I see Marcus Garvey on the wall and say "damn it
Who he starin' at?" My grandma say, "Lord of the planet"
You can tell she is a fan of the Black Panthers
T-Nice ran with a posse, only do damage (Right)
That's what I'm sayin', drug game like a cancer
He was wearin' pandas, minks coats, now he in the slammer (Yeah)
And I can't stand her like "Dirty Diana" (Right)
Life's a bitch, you's my grandma, grandma
My fathers cross cost an arm and a hammer (Right)
People think they broad is all from Atlanta (Yeah)
Was never home and showed up to be Santa (Ah)
I used to hang out with gang bangers like Santana that wear bandanas
And red clothes with pit bulls, the red nose
[?]
Keep the "Smith &" if you slippin', you got rich, just let me get it

[Outro]
Family
Oh, my family
Yeah, uh
Oh, my family
Yeah
Oh, my family
I do it
Oh, my family
Do it
Oh, my family
I do it
Do it
Do it
