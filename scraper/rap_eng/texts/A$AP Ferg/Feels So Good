[Chorus: A$AP Nast]
Yuh, I can't relate, uh, yuh (no)
To none of you, rappers are actors
I swear that these niggas be fake, uh (no, yuh, yuh, ayy)
Fuck out my face (face, fuck out my face)
Yuh, way too much food on my plate for her to be actin' all stank
Yuh, uh, diamonds on bling (bling blaww-blaww)
Yuh, we smoked out, my bitch is so bad
I had to go buy her a mink, whew (mink, ayy)
Fuck what you think, yuh (fuck what you, fuck what you think)
Yeah, 'cause me and the money in love, I think I'ma buy it a ring

[Verse 1: A$AP Ant]
My diamond's shinin', yours cloudy
Diamond's ice, play hockey
Lean got me feelin' drowsy
Stripper bitch, she work at Follies
Meet me at the hotel lobby
Air Max, runnin' to the money
You ain't takin' nothin' from me
And I'm gon' die 'bout it

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
(Focus...)
From demons, distractions
To all the reactions of fame
She probably collapsin' her heart over taxes
I'm blowin' a kiss on the way
Production big, can't fit on a stage
Too many fans to fit in the crowd
Too many bands to get 'em on stage
His crew and his band is with him on stage
I say in advance, so pay in advance
I'm way too advanced to figure him out
I set the bar, don't give 'em a break
The bar's too high to give it a raise
A flow, like God, so give him a raise
Stones I got, I get 'em appraised
Draw my Glock and get him erased
Flow you got, I give it away

[Chorus: A$AP Nast]
Yuh, I can't relate, uh, yuh (no, no)
To none of you, rappers are actors
I swear that these niggas be fake, uh (no, yuh, yuh, ayy)
Fuck out my face (face, fuck out my face)
Yuh, way too much food on my plate for her to be actin' all stank

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
Niggarace, new Versace
Sippin' sake with my posse (yeah, ah)
Eat that pussy like Hibachi
Leave it wet, that dick Dasani (ah, alright)
Salvador Dal√≠, her body (yeah)
It's a work of art, you copy? (yeah, Ferg)
Nigga, all she do Pilates
I go hard, you rappers copy (ooh, damn)

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
'Cause it feels so good when it's you
And it feels so good when it's new
'Cause it feels so good when it's new (ayy)
Why you actin' like you ain't knew?

[Verse 4: A$AP Ferg]
Niggarace, new Versace
I be mobbin' with my posse
Stretch that coochie like pilates
I'm gon' eat it like Hibachi
Play no game, no Tamagotchi
Finger froze like Liberace
Fuck that bitch, I make her knock knee
While I rep Trilluminati

[Verse 5: A$AP Twelvyy]
Yah, oh, right
Pelle Pelle, butter soft, we was in 'em lobbies
Holla, holla, steady mobbin', only God can stop me, huh
Dollar signs, a lot of diamonds, I'm about to sign me
Cop a Tommy, yeah, the Tommy
Thousand band like Fauni, yeah
All in the forest, hey
Lookin' for porridge, hey
Ricky in storage, fresh with the chorus
Dressed like a tourist, hey, yeah
That's with the bomber, huh
Fuck up some commas, hey, hmm
Glock for the drama, hey
Do what I want, fuck when I wanna...

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
'Cause it feels so good when it's you
And it feels so good when it's new
'Cause it feels so good when it's new (ayy)
Why you actin' like you ain't knew?

[Chorus: A$AP Nast & A$AP Ferg]
(Niggarace) Yuh, I can't relate, uh, yuh (no)
To none of you, rappers are actors
I swear that these niggas be fake, uh (no, yuh, yuh, ayy)
(Niggarace) Fuck out my face (face, fuck out my face)
Yuh, way too much food on my plate for her to be actin' all stank
Yuh, uh, diamonds on bling (bling blaww-blaww)
Yuh, we smoked out, my bitch is so bad
I had to go buy her a mink, whew (mink, ayy)
Fuck what you think, yuh (fuck what you, fuck what you think)
Yeah, 'cause me and the money in love, I think I'ma buy it a ring
Yuh (what?)
