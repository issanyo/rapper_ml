[Chorus: Bas]
I'm out in Boca Raton
I'm sippin' Roca Patron
I got this chick on the phone
Talkin' 'bout life and how I just ain't right for her—I been inclined to agree
'Cause all I been doin' is me, now
I can't be your one, baby girl—nah
But I play the two or the three, now

[Verse 1: Bas]
Give her the dick and I'm gone
I'm like a tickin' time bomb
I'm on the road, grind time for the dough, it's my time
She cheer me on—pom-poms
She good for the soul, she good for the mind
She help me get found—TomTom
She help me eat clean—balsamic
She might end up meetin' my mama
Let's take it back like western time zones
Used to call you up to share my milestones
Now you hear my voice and sound annoyed
Might as well be talkin' to the dial tone
I been living dreams it ain't what it seems
Splittin' at the seam when it—
Splittin' at the seam when it come to you

[Chorus: Bas]
I'm out in Boca Raton
I'm sippin' Roca Patron
I got this chick on the phone
Talkin' 'bout life and how I just ain't right for her—I been inclined to agree
'Cause all I been doin' is me, now
I can't be your one, baby girl—nah
But I play the two or the three, now

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Ayy
I flew out to Boca Raton (Yeah)
Had to meet my nigga, Bas (Uh)
He took a break from the road (Yeah)
Decided to party with Cozz
Had to get away from the cold (Right)
The Winter was killin' my vibe
Just got off the phone with J. Cole
Told him that I'm with the guys (Wooh, wooh, wooh)
Look in my eye, I'm seein' life through Versace (Ayy)
Dippin' in the Mazi, 'bout to eat Hibachi
Now with the pass the Courvoisier (Ayy)
Sippin' till I'm sloppy (Ayy, ayy), fuck her till she knock knees
I put a hurtin' on her 'nani (Yeah)
Anaconda through her body, got her screamin', "Golly!"
Dale boom dale (Huh)
She a work of art like a Salvador Dali (Ayy, ayy)
It's like a Prada robbery
Nothing but designer, when you go shoppin'
You want the Zonda or 'Rari?
We could get both so you know this shit poppin' (Ayy, ayy)
Feelin' like Tommy in Belly when Keisha and him got it poppin' (Ayy, ayy)
Put her head in my tummy, Boca Raton, I ain't leavin' this party (Ayy, ayy)

[Bridge: A$AP Ferg & Bas]
I can't help the way you think when I'm not with you
I'm not with the way you think when I'm not with you
Baby, we know just what we got
Only we know just what we got
I can't help the way you think when I'm not with you
I'm not with the way you think when I'm not with you
Baby, we know just what we got
Only we know just what we got

[Chorus: Bas]
I'm out in Boca Raton
I'm sippin' Roca Patron
I got this chick on the phone
Talkin' 'bout life and how I just ain't right for her—I been inclined to agree
'Cause all I been doin' is me, now
I can't be your one, baby girl—nah
But I play the two or the three, now

[Outro: Bas]
