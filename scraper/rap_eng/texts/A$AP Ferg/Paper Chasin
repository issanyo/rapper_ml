[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
Chasing, chasing, chasing, chasing
Eyy I'm like a bad doctor I ain't got no patience
Eyy, uuhh, eyy

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Chasing, chasing, chasing  all this paper chasing
I'm like a bad doctor, I ain't got no patience (Yeah)
I'm gon' work for months, I won't take vacations (That's Right)
Chasing, chasing, chasing all this paper chasing
Chasing, chasing, chasing all this paper chasing
I'm like a bad doctor, I ain't got no patience (No patience)
I'm gon' work for months, I won't take vacations (Right)
'Cause I'm chasing, chasing, chasing all this paper chasing

[Verse 1: Dave East]
I don't care about them other niggas
We came up from nothing, it was never  with us
Tell Kairi I love her, if they ever get us out of town
Poppin with 11 niggas
You want this cuban, you will never get it
Couple hundred thousand, I will never spend it
Sneak dissing, I was never with it
I got money coming, I ain't never tripping
Ferg and your boy on and paper chasing
All of these diamonds, they look like a lake and I mix the Margiela with Bathing Ape
I put codeine in the Gatorade
I walk in the club and the boss stop
Can't pronounce what I pulled out the car lot (Scurr)
Emotional niggas be all in their feeling 'cus killing they bitch had a soft spot (My bad)
In the jungle, I got tiger in me
Fake pages, you cannot offend me
Jumping out a foreign from without a penny
Had a hood booger, now a model with me
I go deliver on a Sunday
Using feature money for the gunplay
I'm driving drunk down a one way
Since I got a F, ain't caught one case, Eastside

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Chasing, chasing, chasing  all this paper chasing
I'm like a bad doctor, I ain't got no patience (Yeah)
I'm gon' work for months, I won't take vacations (Right)
Chasing, chasing, chasing all this paper chasing
Chasing, chasing, chasing all this paper chasing
I'm like a bad doctor, I ain't got no patience (Yeah)
I'm gon' work for months, I won't take vacations (Right)
Cause I'm chasing, chasing, chasing all this paper chasing

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Chasing, chasing, all this paper chasing
I'ma work for months, all this money making
Fucking on your lady while you're masturbating
Me and Dave East finna rule a nation (Yeah)
Money smile like I'm Richard Porter
Uncle used to pitch the water
Gotta meet his quota, I was young and stealin' quarter waters
Now my diamonds colder than Minnesota
Fuck your bitch, I'ont even call her
Buy her Louis, I'ont even spoil her
Short nigga but my money taller
Cus my flow is hotter than a fucking sauna
Live in Harlem like I'm Frank Lucas
Dentist put a diamond where the tooth is
White and black bitch like clueless
Montell Will, how we do this

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Chasing, chasing, chasing  all this paper chasing (yeah)
I'm like a bad doctor, I ain't got no patience (Yeah)
I'm gon' work for months, I won't take vacations (That's right)
Chasing, chasing, chasing all this paper chasing
Chasing, chasing, chasing all this paper chasing
I'm like a bad doctor, I ain't got no patience (Yeah)
I'm gon' work for months, I won't take vacations (Right)
