(Verse 1: Bristol Boy)
Ok, Plain jane, thats all you are!
The way you do it is so fucking lame
Don’t compare me to another white rapper
We’re not the same bitch! I have a different
Name, its so unique, Bristol Boy! yeah
I take passion with this rap shit, I gotta train
So I can get my name out! Make the cash come out
Make some money. The fans decide who succeeds
My dream is for me to at least crack billboard
You see, I hope to get money, i like to be funny
Thats just who I am, its me. People will say my
Shit is wack. Well I am wacky, ha ha
I’ll chew on you like some laffy taffy. Bitch
I can deal with the hate. so its checkmate
Bitch, yeah you’re hating now? Its too late!

(Verse 2: A$AP Ferg)
Presi plain Jane
Yamborghini chain, rest in peace to my superior
Hermes link could feed a village in Liberia
TMZ taking pictures causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'mma start killin' niggas
How you get that tribe
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work sellin' Nicks at night
I was only 8 years old watching Nick at Nite
Uncle psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his guts
Hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy selling fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I fuck yo bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo hoe if yo bitch keep eyeing me
