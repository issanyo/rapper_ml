[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
I Milly Rock and I’m Diddy bopping

Take your girl and give her Fendi, Prada (Oh yeah)
Now we finna go to Bennihana’s
Ambition of a rider, pay attention to your daughter

Guess I won’t feel a thing ‘til I’m humping on Rihanna
Watch how I kill the game when I hit it with the album

At Club Lust, getting turnt up, you know I be wyling

In my Polo T, and my Polo socks
On top of cars my face hot

They got me on their explore page
I've been milly rocking for four days
Nah, we don't battle, I never, man
We just Milly Rock, when we're hella bent
I'm smoking weed, I'm counting cash
I'm milly rocking on Patchen Ave
First arms up, then left and right
That MJ get out my sight (Get out my sight)

That drink strong, I mix it up (mix it up)
We hopping out, and we hitting this (yeah)
On any block rock militant

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I’m the talk and that’s off the top
Ankle monitor over my sock
Black Market is all we got
Christmas time, gift wrapping blocks
Swear Yeezy, rainy day I floss
808, y’all [?] a boss
Last name and I say the biggest
You fallin’ off like Philip Rivers
Dab bitch, like I’m Cam Newton (dab)
Flex harder than Lex Luger (dab)
My dick hard and my set ruthless (dab)
I been rich and your bitch been loose. (dab)
Her eyelash and her weave long (dab)
My Mulsanne twenty feet long (damn)
My temper short, this match stick (dab)
I burn the [?] down that quick (dab)
