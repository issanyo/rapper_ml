[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I’mma show you motherfuckers how to kill a remix
Comin’ all black like I’m hittin’ them licks
All black .40 with them ladders hangin’ out
30-round clips, call them shits chopsticks
Run up in the booth with a ski mask on
Run up in the booth make a ski mask song
Run up the booth, then I hop up in the Coupe
Now I’m ridin’ in the ‘Rari with a ski mask on
I’m too bossed up, I need to turn my boss down
King of the Street shit, where the fuck is my crown?
Graduated from the street with my cap and my gown
You the motherfuckin’ man if you servin’ your town
My lil’ nigga eat, sleep, shit and deal cocaine
Not that rap shit, I’m talkin’ real cocaine
CTE, TBC (what is is, homeboy?) “Boss Yo Life Up Gang”
With my boss bitch and she bossed up
On that 2Pac, she’s gettin’ tossed up
Can’t cross me, you’ll get crossed up
Can’t cross me, I’m too bossed up
My name Hefe, I do boss shit
No on star, get lost, bitch
You a bitch nigga? Then kick rocks
Just know rich niggas do drop-tops
You ain’t shit, I talk shit
Ebola rhymes, my watch sick
I’m Top Gun, I’m in the cockpit
Got the game locked, call the locksmith
No Stan Smith, I do gourmet
Giuseppes, new J's
My earrings, they cold as fuck
Call the North Pole, that’s bossin’ up

[Hook]
Valet park my whip, nigga
Hammer time for my chips, nigga
(Bossin’ up) add it up
Your girlfriend choosin’ so you mad as fuck
Chillin’ with my coalition, niggas rackin’ up
(Bossin’ up) add it up
(Bossin’ up) add it up
A lil’ Louis, but my bitch want some bags and stuff

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
It go, uhh
Bossin’ up and you downgrade
Look around and see a bunch of clowns
Tryna represent my town lately (wait)
I’ve been gone for like 30 days
I wore every chain, no wedding ring
Got a boss bitch and she understand
That timing is everything
Nah, don’t trip – put it on the tab
Knowin’ I’m a G, gotta put it on the bag
Break a bitch down, gotta put her in a cast
She ain’t got a ride, might put her in a cab
You ain’t even know, nigga? Put him in a class
Trip, Big Chuck might put you in the past
Hit a blunt hard, nigga, put me in the pads
Just rolled up, but the high don’t last
Ridin’ through the city, hope I don’t crash
Know they thought that it wasn’t gon’ last
You can’t even tell me why you mad?
Is it really that bad, is you doin’ that bad?
What you make in a year I pay in taxes
The money burnin’ holes in my pocket
I just need somewhere to ash it
Nah, you ain’t gotta ask, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Monatana]
You know it's Mr. Haaanhh

Hunnit in them them K's nigga
In that Porsche, boxed up, stunting 'till-my grave nigga
Strapped with the 40, shit real out chea
Talking about the purpose smoking fills outchea (han)
Stingy with the money, but the shells I shed
And my nigga rip the gold off ya grill out chea
Pull up in a tank (tank), cup full of drank (drank)
Make 10 mill, stuff it in a bank (bank)
50 on a rollie, 100 on a lane (bling)
Think you an animal turn you to a mank (woo)
Throwing dust, throwing bullets (bullt), stunting on the po pull up
Top-off, car-hooded, this-South-Bronx-boogie

[Hook]

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
Uh
Harlem nigga with the gold teeth
Hilfiger nigga, only OG
Hilfiger niggas, only 4 deep
But for real, a trilla' nigga bring the whole street
Four trill bitches on my Rollie
Montana hammer, like I'm Tony
Cocaina ‘til her nose bleed
Make a girl wanna cuff like the police
That flacko nigga goldie
Me and Rocky like Apollo Creed
Relax to the max, no cozy
Big dogs on the crib but I'm low-key
Don't fúck with them niggas that be phony
Young B XXX don't even know me
She all on my wang, Alexander Wang
Yeah, Margiela feel the leather - 4G
These Ape's on my feet, make my cypher complete
Make girls scream "Lord" like I am a priest
I'm a boss nigga, climbing seas
Just collect cash while designing sneaks
Whip yo teeth every time I speak
3 thou for the smile, nigga I'm a G
Better talk to me nice, nigga I'm a chief
You dealing with a boss, so I need PC
Yeah, I'm bout this bread
I'm bout this dough
I'm bout this dough
Ooooo-ooo, ooooo, ooooo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: YG]
Okay, I’m bossin’ up
‘Cause I done already lost enough
See, like… ever since last year
Everythin’ I’m buyin’, now it cost one up
Say, it’s dark as fuck…
Girl, why you actin’ hard to fuck?
Why you got your guards up?
Like you playin’ ball or somethin’
Pull up in that Porsche Panamera, park it up
Hop out lookin’ sharp as fuck, tint dark as fuck
Bitch, fuck up off
But you know we don’t love them hoes
Yeah, me and Young partnerin’ up
That’s the talk in all the barbershops, nigga
Shaq height, couldn’t baller block
Probably invest in all the stocks
I’m 400, corporate thuggin’, pushin’ at the label
Mama still got bills that’s gotta be paid for
Remember when mama wasn’t able?
With them credit card numbers, I was payin’ cable
It’s all respect over here… we gettin’ checks over here
All my homies rap, so all my niggas got next over here

[Hook]
