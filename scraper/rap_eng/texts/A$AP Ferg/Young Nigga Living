[Sampled laugh from The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]

[Verse 1: A$AP Ant]
Young wild nigga, I'm high as hell
Break a whole pound down, smell the smell
Word around town, they ringing bells
All my niggas cracking, lock the shells
Sweat pants on with the YSL
Might go Dipset Pelle Pelle
All white on, the light snow
In the summer time my fly glow
Some hate me, some love me though
Bitches on the guest list at my shows
In the mosh-pit throwing elbows
Day dream of getting that Phantom Rolls
Pour up, slow down, catch the flow
Bum niggas want to steal my clothes
Thirsty niggas want to fuck my hoes
Run up on me meet the 44
Mobbing ten deep in the Tahoe
Drug money, rap money, more dough
Pops taught me 'bout the wrist game
Rap don't work, flip cocaine
Do it for the money, do it for the fame
Don't love the hoes, let my bros run trains
Puffing on gas, lighting up the flame
City on my back like a campaign
Cross-over, slammed, that LeBron James
Peanut butter inside, wood grain
Pull up on your block like a goblin
All you see is guns, get to sparking
Then the police get to chalking
Dope in the car, no walk in
Outbid a nigga, no bargain, nigga

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvy]
Young nigga living
Young nigga living, fucking these bitches
Niggas ain't made for the stone cold
Niggas pull K's for the coco
I'ma just blaze with the .44, stand back
Blow haze in my low low, catch a fade then I go go
Act right, then I fade to the slow-mo
That's right got a pay for the po-po
On the West got the drank for the low low
Bounce in my low low, vision like a GoPro
Down Melrose, got about twelve hoes
In the Valley, I got about twelve more
Two twelve in the pell, give em' hell
Like you came from the twelfth floor
Got the bell, get the bands like a billfold
Where they at? Man I'm strapped like Velcro
Where I'm at I'ma bad in the hell hole
Where it's at matter fact who the hell knows
It's a fact that I rap and I move O's
Then the Act got me slapped, man I'm too slow
Then I'm trapped in a trap turn the two door
Porsche 9-1-1, shit too cold
Man I'm one then I'm done then it's new coach
Man 9-1-1, we don't do those

[Hook: A$AP Twelvyy]
Young nigga living
Young nigga living, fucking these bitches
Young nigga living
Young nigga living, handle my business
Young nigga living
Young nigga living, getting this chicken
Young nigga living
Young nigga living, 4 that I'm sipping
Young nigga living
Young nigga living, young nigga living
Young nigga living
Young nigga living, fucking these bitches
Young nigga living
Young nigga living, handle my business
Young nigga living
Young nigga living, getting this chicken

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
Life's so hard
R.I.P. Grandma
These cops play different
Every corner got a camera
I swear the game got a cancer
These lil niggas bust a hammer
With bitch made tendencies
Make 'em wanna give they man up
Ain't about gang bangers or color bandannas
Or holding your fist up and repping The Panthers
See Willie still Lynching they want us to hang us
Game is still pimping adapted the changes
I'll take your 360, work off your anus
Shit on these niggas, like you constipated
See that's what I did and momma I made it
But I'm gone out my mind and my point is vacated
I can't take this world, ain't got the patience
Years of oppression, I'm feeling violated
And that's why my niggas be highly sedated
Addicted to money and driving new Ranges
Gone off the lean, want to stay faded
They can't even drink 'cause their life is so jaded
I want to be clean but the water is so tainted
Ain't it?
