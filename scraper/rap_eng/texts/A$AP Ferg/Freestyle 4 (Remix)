[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I tell a bitch quit playing
Stick to the plan (uhh)
Then I take you out the dirt and turn it into sand
Just trust in what I'm saying (and quit)
Quit asking what's gotten into me
You don't need a nigga with them tender tendencies
I think you need a lil' more Hennessy
Fuck your man, I'll be your sensei
I could teach you how to keep the rent paid
Got the schedule boomin', I mean poppin'
Poppin' to the point the phone die in mid-day (brrt)
But I call you late night just to fall through
Bust a nut and then regret it like a nigga always do
But don't I always hit you with the hit back
And if I ever fucked another bitch I pretended it was you
I admit that, not saying that I did that
Chill, chill, chill, take it easy, Yeezy, don't be going all Kill Bill
Show respect to the whole squad and Yeezy Yeezy
I'ma give you everything you fucking needed

[Outro: Big Sean]
Believe it

Whoa, whoa, whoa
