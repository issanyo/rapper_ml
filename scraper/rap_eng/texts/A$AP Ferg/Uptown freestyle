Im riding around uptown
Smoking these niggas like ganja
My Bands is a motherfucking monster
Putting work like im a fucking shotta
Balling on niggas like you never seen before
Nigga im secure on this shit im 4 sure
Addicted in rhyming cuz im fucking dope
Me and my niggas molesting these lyrics
Massive flow spitter to these niggas
But it ain't nothing but realistic bullshit
This shit making me feel like a fucking wizard
Too many of you snake niggas in the grass
Harass your feelings that turn you into a lizard
My cold heart turned brick like a blizzard
Im done with you fuck niggas
Im trying to be a winner
