[Chorus]
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind

[Verse 1]
Woke up, seen Daddy in bed with another woman
Thought that was Mama, "hey ma"- hold up, that couldn't
Be her, what I'm thinking, cause she just went to work
It was a naked look-a-like and Daddy there with no skirt
See, Daddy was getting busy when I barged in
Then when I said "mommy?", he chuckled and grinned
Then I soon realized that the  crust in my eyes
Had the chick looking like Mama love from the side
See, Daddy was a player and I wasn't surprised
He would holla at the girls when we rolled with the guys
Should I hate or embrace these ties?
I mean, I praise this dude, god's sake, he's fly
He couldn't do no wrong in my eyes
But at the same time, I hated to see my mama cry
Ain't no wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind

[Chorus]
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind

[Verse 2]
I've got commitment issues, did from when I was young
Wasn't tryna fit in my uncle's Timberlands, he was dumb
His shoe was too small to fit my big toe in
Ain't wanna walk in his shoes, he was just hoeing
He stayed broke, them bitches provided for him
Whether skinny, fat, black or tyrannosaurus
He was a gigolo, and never minded whoring
Guess the money gave him new ways to ignore it
Pussy is pussy, and new clothes the way he saw it
This ain't Enyce nigga, what she brought in?
To see him kiss her ass made me nauseous
Then he'd give her sloppy hugs like my baby gorgeous
He was just doing that for the new forces
All this fucking bullshit that had my brain distorted
Ain't no wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind

[Chorus]
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind

[Verse 3]
I've got commitment issues, even with my craft
Didn't think Willie Lynch was that good at math
Took a lil' black baby 'way from mom and dad
Now he lost in the field and it's so sad
The mind of a slave, at a young age
Can't talk to a girl or know how to engage
He think being a gentleman is wrong and gay
But he feel that way cause that's how he was raised
He watched dad diss mom, she got play
And your uncle only had a girl when he got paid
All this shit put my life in a maze
Then when I grow up, marriage in a haze
Ain't no wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
To all the ladies, I'll just say it one more time
Somewhere along down the line, it's affected our minds

[Chorus]
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
