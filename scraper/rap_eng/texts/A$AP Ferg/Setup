[Intro: Kirk Knight + A$AP Ferg]
Turn the beat up

Ferg

Kirk Knight in this bitch
Parkside Ave

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Uh huh, shut up, my bitch with the shit, you get set up
Uh huh, shut up, thirty round clip, you get wet up
Uh huh, shut up, chopper gon' sound like propeller
Uh huh, shut up, the grip and the fifth for the cheddar

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Used to take a shower with detergent
Now I'm rich feelin' on the Persian
Ridin' in a Bent' with the curtains
"Who that jiggy nigga swervin'?"
Put it to your broad, I put the work in
Do not touch ho when she jerkin'
She eat that dick like some beef jerky
I stuff that pussy like some turkey
October 20th, that's my birthday
But I celebrate that shit like 'errrday
Got her touchin' her toes like a birth bae
Got me swimmin' in the pussy like a mermaid, yeah
Switchin' up the whip, this my Thursday
Ferrari to the party on a Friday
Like Usher, I do this shit my way
Tell Kirk Knight this beat caught a body

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Uh huh, shut up, my bitch with the shit, you get set up
Uh huh, shut up, thirty round clip, you get wet up
Uh huh, shut up, chopper gon' sound like propeller
Uh huh, shut up, the grip and the fifth for the cheddar

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight + A$AP Ferg]
Walk in this bitch, that's a setup
Secret is out, niggas fed up (right)
In the hood, gotta keep head up
Complain about me but don't ever do better
Can't act hella cheezy, the cheddar been stackin' for months
I'm just maxing the effort
Keep my blood boilin' like it's a kettle
I already established that I'll never settle
Makin' the money flip, so many times
Iâ€™m thinkin' that I deserve medals
So I just left the jeweler, bought a new chain
So bright it just light up the ghetto
Got a new bitch and she drive me insane
Cut that bitch out, she the devil
Pussy killer nigga, Kirk, get the shovel
Hold up, Fergie, man we on a new level, yeah

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Uh huh, shut up, my bitch with the shit, you get set up
Uh huh, shut up, thirty round clip, you get wet up
Uh huh, shut up, chopper gon' sound like propeller
Uh huh, shut up, the grip and the fifth for the cheddar

[Outro]
Uh huh, shut up
Uh huh, shut up
Uh huh, shut up
Uh huh, shut up
