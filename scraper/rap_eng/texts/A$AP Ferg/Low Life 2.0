[Chorus: Sam Harris]
I'm nothing but a low life
Thinking 'bout my own life
I can't help myself from falling
Can't help myself from falling
I'm nothing but a low life
Thinking 'bout my own life
I'm trying to fight the good old fight
But after it all, I'm still just a low life

[Verse 1: Jamie N Commons]
Wanna be a better man, but it's a hard life
Without that love inside you, it's a cold bind
And I started to reflect on all that's been before
You start to wonder, but you, but you can't be sure

[Pre-Chorus: Jamie N Commons]
Now please tell me I'm broke
It's much easier that way cause I just let you down
It's much easier that way

[Chorus: Sam Harris]
I'm nothing but a low life
Thinking 'bout my own life
I can't help myself from falling
Can't help myself from falling
I'm nothing but a low life
Thinking 'bout my own life
I'm trying to fight the good old fight
But after it all, I'm still just a low life

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
A low life was my uncle when he hit that crystal
That glass pipe and that rock had him toting pistols
He was higher than a missile with a dozen issues
And every time he cried, he never reached for tissue
Attention seeking, sneaking, screeching when he sneaking leaving
My grandma hid the hammer from him, he be out there beefing
Always lying, don't believe him
He be out there thieving
On the corners chiefing, middle finger to policemen
Always telling mama he just got a new job
So he could get some dollars for a metro card
He just get a 40 oz, now he livin' large
He even took my bike and sold it, man I swear to God

[Chorus: Sam Harris & Jamie N Commons]
I'm still just a low life
Nothing but a low life
I can't help myself from falling
I can't help myself from falling
I'm nothing but a low life (nothing but a low life)
Thinking 'bout my own life (thinking 'bout my own life)
I'm trying to fight the good old fight
But after it all, I'm still just a low life
