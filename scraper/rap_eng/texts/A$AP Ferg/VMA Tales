[Intro]
From that east side where them niggas gon ride
I’m from that east side where them niggas gon ride
I’m from the B side where them niggas gon ride
I’m from the B side where them niggas gon ride
All my west side niggas, be down fo life…
All my west side niggas, be down fo life…
West side niggas be down fo life
All my west side niggas be down fo life…

[Hook]
Take a look at a G and then you feeling my team
Can you feel a nigga finna kill it?
We done travelled the world and we livin a dream
Everybody wanna fuckin hear it
My niggas guzzle the lean, puff puffin the weed
Puff puffin that good kush
Never gon be Hollywood cus I’m in love with the streets
And they got a nigga singing like
Like like oh oh oh…
Oh oh oh…
Oh oh oh…
Oh oh oh…

[Verse]
All my niggas made it, can’t believe we did it
All my niggas ballin’, and we used to be in pivots
Dreams of fuckin Jada Pinkett, spittin Jason Lyric
I was at the VMA’s, in back of the nigga Will Smith
It was so dark that he didn’t realize
The man shook my hand, almost started to cry
Couldn’t believe Weezy bowed to me inside
Said you the hottest nigga, you on the rise
Lady Gaga was in front of me with her thighs
Swear that got my dick jump a couple times
Flacko was on stage and shouted me out
Trap Lord in stores, what I’m talkin about

Oh oh…
Oh oh oh…
Oh oh oh…
Oh oh oh…
Damn

[Interlude]
Ayo Q, shout outs to my brotha Q man
Shout outs to all my A$AP niggas
We came a long way
We was born this way
We grinded for this
Now we here, we arrived
Aye man shout outs to everybody always strivin and prosperin man
That’s what we about
Fo life
This shit is tatted on me fo life
Yea

[Hook]
Take a look at a G and then you feeling my team
Can you feel a nigga finna kill it?
We done travelled the world and we livin a dream
Everybody wanna fuckin hear it
My niggas guzzle the lean, puff puffin the weed
Puff puffin that good kush
Never gon be Hollywood cus I’m in love with the streets
And they got a nigga singing like
Like like oh oh oh…
Oh oh oh…
Oh oh oh…
Oh oh oh…
