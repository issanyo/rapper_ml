[Chorus]
At 7 AM, I wake up, hit the green
I hit my teeth with Listerine (yeah)
I pray to God to live my dream
My teeth gon' gleam on magazine
That blue check on my Twitter screen
That blue check on my Insta-green (yeah)
Blue check, it don't validate me

[Verse 1]
Blue check-blue check (yeah)
Blue check on the side of the screen (yeah)
Blue check, I'm gon' ride in a beam
Blue check, they gon' holler at me
On your screen, got a model with me
Up in the club with a bottle with me
Now all the girls, they swallowing "D" (yeah)
Back in the day, they ain't riding with me (right)

[Chorus]
At 7 AM, I wake up, hit the green
I take my phone up out my jean (huh, right)
Wake up and I'm proud of me
That blue check on the side of the screen (huh, right)
That blue check is gon' validate me
That blue check, now they gotta hate me (alright)
Blue check is gon' validate me
Blue check is gon'-blue-blue-blue (grr)
