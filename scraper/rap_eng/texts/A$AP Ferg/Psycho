[Intro]
Uhh, yeah
Uhh, yeah
Uhh, it was all at the park, yeah
Cologne and liquor was his odor (uhh, yeah)
The fragrance of a riding soldier (uhh)
ODB was his persona
(I've seen a lot of bullshit, go down at the park)
Oh, you want the power, don't ya?

[Chorus]
I got an uncle and his name Psycho
He had a dance and they scream "Go, Psycho!"
He would dance, work out and fight yo' ass at the park
(For the bills, for the hundred dollar bills)
And he got two sisters preggo
He fucked the other one to get one jeal-o
And he took both kids to the ghetto ass park
(On the hill, shit'll get really real)

[Verse 1]
He used to have the braids with the cuts in his body
Most thugged out, kept the hammer with his mami
Grandma had the arthritis pain in her body
Kept the burner in the mattress, so her son donâ€™t catch a body
Danced and he danced, smoked crack with his posse
Front flipped through a building window, land in the lobby
He was cut like Bruce Lee but he didn't know karate
He came home bloody screaming "Nobody can stop me!
Nobody can stop me, I'm the baddest survivor on this planet
Fifty niggas better kill me, nigga, 'cause I will do damage
Checked outta the psych ward, I am nothing to manage
My life cut deep, nigga I'm nothing to bandage"

[Chorus]
I got an uncle and his name Psycho
He had a dance and they scream "Go, Psycho!"
He would dance, work out and fight yo' ass at the park
(For the bills, for the hundred dollar bills)
And he got two sisters preggo
He fucked the other one to get one jel-o
And he took both kids to the ghetto ass park
(On the hill, shit'll get really real)

[Bridge]
Where they be drinking forty ounces
With the brown paper bags for the ounces
No matter what day you found his ass at the park
Hungry Ham, fuck around and get killed
When he got kicked out of his bitch crib
And he had nowhere to li-zive
Always find his ass on the benches laying at the park
After dark

[Verse 2]
Don't get it confused Uncle Psych, I love you to death
Just wanna get a couple of things off of my chest
Growing up, you always was buck-wilding with stress
And though I'm older now, I don't know how to forget
I used to wear your Timbs around the house when you left
And if you had an open soda, I would finish the rest
Pretend I'm older, I like the liquor odor you left
Then put your camouflage vest on like I'm holding a tec
Then point it at the mirror like I'm holding your rep
Through that mirror wasn't me, but it was you I reflect
Wanted to be like you, jail tat on the chest
With the rugged cornrows and a stab on my neck

[Outro: Uncle Psycho]
I'll rob shit like that you know
Cause I'll rob anybody, I, I don't care
It was a 9 to 5 for me, you know
It was like a hobby to me, I was the gunman
I was the dancer, entertainer, you know what I mean? I did it all
Like I said I had a death wish, I'll rob anybody
Ay, hold up motherfucker, you see I'm talking, right?!
