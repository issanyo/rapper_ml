[Verse 1]
I'm from the Eastside where the niggas gonna ride
I'm from the Eastside where the niggas gonna ride
I'm from the B-side where them niggas gonna ride
I'm from the B-side where them niggas gonna ride
All my Westside niggas be down for life
All my Westside niggas be down for life
Westside niggas be down for life
All my Westside niggas be down for life

[Hook}
Take a look at a G
I know you're feeling my team
Can you feel a nigga fitting to kill it?
Cause we travel the world like we're living a dream
Everybody wanna fucking hear it
My niggas guzzle the lean
Puff, puffing the weed
Puff, Puffing the good kush
Never gonna be Hollywood
Because I'm in love with the streets
And they gotta nigga singing like
OH-ooh-OH
OH-ooh-OH
OH-ooh-OH
OH-ooh-OH

[Verse 2]
All my niggas made it
Can't believe we did it
All my niggas balling
And we used to be in pivots[?]
Dreams of fucking Jada Pinkett
Spitting [?]
I was at the VMA's
In back of that nigga Will Smith
Will was so drunk that he didn't realize
[?]
Almost started to cry
Couldn't believe Weezy bowed to me
And said you the hottest nigga
You on the rise
Lada Gaga was there
In front of me with her thighs
Swear to god my dick jump up a couple of times
Flocka was on stage, he shouted me out
Trap Lord in stores what I'm talking about
OH-ooh-OH

[Hook]
