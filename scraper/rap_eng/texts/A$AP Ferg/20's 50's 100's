[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
Talk to me nice or don’t talk to me at all
Big moneyish, haha

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Walked in the club and the booty clappin’
Mama got me hot, like a dragon
I’m about to throw a hundred down, I ain’t braggin’
I wanna murder the pussy and toe tag it
She lookin’ like “Ferg, you so ratchet”
I met your ass here so you know ratchet
Let’s do it on the stage, fuck a matress
Rub in it your face like ProActiv
I’m about to stick you up like a polar cactus
Keep makin’ it clap, bag know your status
Weave all in my lap, brain not so average
Her weave the best like DJ Khaled
But she out for the green like a bowl of salad
20’s, 50’s, 100’s
I’mma head to the ATM girl
Now, tell me how you want it

[Verse 2: King avriel]
Somethin’ like a scene from “Set It Off”
Four chicks packed deep in a van with a mind to crack a vault
Screamin’ money over everything, addicted to adrenaline
Stay chasin’ the thrill until the day we’re caught
All black in July for the love the heist
Willingly pullin' wool over my eyes
Fuck it, I need to survive (fuck it I need to survive)
Strapped up to make sure they get the point across
Grab the teller tie her down, tell her not to make a sound
Fill the duffles, do it now, [feel the devil's doing now]
Before the car comes back around
Promise to leave quietly if you give me what I need
Not really tryna catch a body, just love the feel of paper on me
And all I want is

[Hook: King avriel]
20’s, 100’s, 20’s, 50’s, 100’s
20’s, 100’s, 20’s, 50’s, 100’s
20’s, 100’s, 20’s, 50’s, 100’s
All I wanna see is green and all I want is
20’s, 100’s, 20’s, 50’s, 100’s
20’s, 100’s, 20’s, 50’s, 100’s
20’s, 100’s, 20’s, 50’s, 100’s
All I wanna see is green

[Verse 3: King avriel]
Posted up outside of Charlestown
Celebratin’, bottles poppin’, panties droppin’
Are you ready? It’s going down
Pour it up, let the dances begin
They fall from the ceiling so fuck it, I’m making it rain
(fuck it I'm making it rain)
Cash to Diamond like a currency exchange
Watch the money as it falls, wonderin’ why I risked it all
Was it worth it, I don’t know
Is guilt better than goin’ broke?
I could leave this quietly, treat this life like history
But first I gotta spend this money
So come here girl and take it from me
Cause all I want is

[Hook: King avriel]
20’s, 100’s, 20’s, 50’s, 100’s
20’s, 100’s, 20’s, 50’s, 100’s
20’s, 100’s, 20’s, 50’s, 100’s
All I wanna see is green, all I want is
20’s, 100’s, 20’s, 50’s, 100’s
20’s, 100’s, 20’s, 50’s, 100’s
20’s, 100’s, 20’s, 50’s, 100’s
All I wanna see is green

[Outro: King avriel & A$AP Ferg]
Pass it up, pass it up
(hey we gotta get to some money)
Pass it up, pass it up, 20’s, 50’s, 100’s, yea
(gotta do what you gotta do, we could build an empire)
Pass it up, pass it up, 20’s, 50’s, 100’s, yea
(man you baby, started off this way, you got potential
A whole lot of potential, I see you)
