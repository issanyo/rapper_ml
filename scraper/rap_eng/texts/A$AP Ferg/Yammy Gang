Don't keep the gun in the holster
Hide it in Tommy, hopin' they don't pull you over
Coppers on the block, tappin' on the Motorola

Yammy Gang Gang, say my name five times

Bitches on my hotline bling
Thank you BasedGod, brang-dang-dang-dang
Me and Pac fuck the same hoes
Beat the pussy like the Wayans Bros
Bang-bang-bang-bang like Chiefy Sosa
Flocka with the fuego
Run at any case, money be the case
Murder be the case, better call the lawyer
Try to beat the case, try to flee the states
Cry to immigration, nigga thought I told you
Nut on her face, bought her shades

Yeezus, Jesus walks with me
Last year bein' broke
If you ain't talkin' money, don't talk to me

[Verse 4: A$AP Twelvyy]
Yamborgini High, diamonds in the rain, made the hall of fame
Prosper be the gang, always gotta strive, I could never change
Word to Yams, I'll smack a nigga in his skinny pants, yeah

[Bridge: A$AP Ferg]
Yeah, Yamborghini Gang
