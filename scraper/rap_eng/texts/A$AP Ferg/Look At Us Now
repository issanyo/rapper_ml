[Verse 1: Ally Brooke]
Oh my Gosh, thought I was stronger
Said I wouldn't be that person, now I'm callin' you
Oh my Gosh, why am I driving?
Said won't let myself fall back inside of you

[Pre-Chorus: Ally Brooke]
Said we shouldn't talk but now we're talkin'
Said we shouldn't touch but now we're touchin'
Said we wouldn't, said we wouldn't, who we fooling?
Probably shouldn't

[Chorus: Ally Brooke]
Look at us now
I just drove to your house, ready for another
When we ain't together
Don't this just feel better, yeah?
We're better when we're not tied down
Turn my ex to my rebound, ready for another
When we ain't together
Don't this just feel better, yeah?
Look at us now
Look at us now

[Verse 2: Ally Brooke]
Wakin' up, feelin' stupid
Said I wouldn't be that person, now I'm here with you
Should've known that I would do this
Why do I even try, try, try, try

[Pre-Chorus: Ally Brooke]
Said we shouldn't talk but now we're talkin'
(Now we're talkin')
Said we shouldn't touch but now we're touchin'
(We're touchin' now)
Said we wouldn't, said we wouldn't, who we fooling?
Probably shouldn't

[Chorus: Ally Brooke]
Look at us now
I just drove to your house, ready for another
When we ain't together
Don't this just feel better, yeah?
We're better when we're not tied down
Turn my ex to my rebound, ready for another
When we ain't together
Don't this just feel better, yeah?
Look at us now
Look at us now

[Post-Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Yeah, bro
That's right (hoo, hoo, hoo)

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
I wanna touch, I wanna rub, I wanna kiss, I wanna love
I wanna uh
I wanna go, I wanna stay, I wanna leave, I wanna lay
I wanna hug
Keep telling me that it's okay, don't wanna play
Don't wanna argue or fuss
Don't wanna hurt, don't wanna curse
It be the girls like you that I won't wanna trust, lust
Really wanna come to, I don't really know how to run from you
And I'm not here 'cause I want to be
I'm just here 'cause I want you
Can we just kick it like kung fu?
My heart's feelin' like what a dumb fool
Man, it felt like I was the only one
I know there was a reason why I dumped you

[Chorus: Ally Brooke & A$AP Ferg]
Look at us now
I just drove to your house, ready for another
When we ain't together
Don't this just feel better, yeah? (come on)
We're better when we're not tied down
Turn my ex to my rebound, ready for another (that's right)
When we ain't together (yeah)
Don't this just feel better, yeah? (don't it? does, don't it? does)
Look at us now (yeah, bro)

[Outro: Ally Brooke]
Look at us now
