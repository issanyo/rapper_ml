[Intro: Ariana Grande]
Keep your hands on me, don’t take them off until I say so
Let me break you off
We’ll be taking off or maybe making love
You just keep your eyes on my you know what

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Trembling when you touch
Rush is racing, body begging
Picture me and you making
Making sweet love, baby, give it to me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Eyes on me
Dance on me tonight, you're all, all I need
Keep your hands on me, don’t take them off

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on me
You can put your hands on me
If you like what you see
Baby, put your hands on me

[Post-Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
It’s your birthday, every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A-S-A-P
It’s your birthday, every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A-S-A-P

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Skirt off, keep the high heels on
I might be a little thing, but I like that long, yeah
Don’t let these eyes fool you
I can take it, hold nothing back, give it to me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Eyes on me
Dance on me tonight, you're all, all I need
Keep your hands on me, don’t take them off

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on me
You can put your hands on me
If you like what you see
Baby, put your hands on me

[Post-Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
It’s your birthday, every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A-S-A-P
It’s your birthday, every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A-S-A-P

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
Can I, can I, can I please put my hand on it?
Shaking like they’re burning, lemme put a fan on it
Bumble bee, I can parachute and land on it
'Cause you got the cake, can I put my candle on it?
It’s your birthday, every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A-S-A-P
Got me talking marriage, I like what I see
I'ma put a ring on it, word to Bey and Jay-Z
But before I do that let me put a hand on it
Oh, so hot I could catch a tan on it
Got me sweating so much we can swim on the dance floor
We gon' have to mess around and put a dam on it, dam on it

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
I love the way it feels
Stay back and keep still
Your hands, oh, please
Baby, don’t take them off
Don’t take them off

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on me
You can put your hands on me
If you like what you see
Baby, put your hands on me
