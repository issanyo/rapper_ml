[Chorus: M.I.A.]
Kill a motherfucka with the AK, what it's for
[?] on the board
Wars and kill 'em when we forced to let it go
Bodies in the gutter, M.I.A. gon' let it go

[Post-Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Unh, I'ma let it go
Watch a nigga drop slow
Bodies flying everywhere

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
I grew up when niggas got put in walls
This ain't The Wire with Omar
No HBO where the show go up
Go Google “Preacher”, then holla at your boy
No job applyin'
Just pa-lyin
Hunt niggas down like Private Ryan
Shit mighta got hit playing in the street
Look out the window, he dead in the street
Dead, casualties in Harlem
Draw guns like galleries in Harlem
No life, they'd rather be in coffin
The right is wrong, what the OGs taught em
Get down!
That's what the police taught em
Come with the van, they scooping all em
Little hooligan with the Smith on him
Old lady upstairs was snitching on him

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
Kill a motherfucka with the AK, what it's for
[?] on the board
[?] kill 'em when we forced to let it go
Bodies in the gutter, M.I.A. gon' let it go

[Verse 2: Crystal Caines]
I'm from Harlem, where it’s eat or be eaten, and either you're doing or die
Put the metal on your spine
Transforming these niggas just like a young Optimus Prime
Heh, I'm in my prime
Can't see what the [?] been grinding all of my life
No time to recline
This a jungle bodies found in the gutter submit to you rhymes
And you (I BBQ)
[?]
It's Trilligan
You know we don't play with rap
And you know not to play with that
My robe chinchilla, hoe
My pockets a [?] because I'm working hoes
Unlock and unload and reload, now his whole body get froze

[Bridge: A$AP Ferg]
Let it go
Let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go
Let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care
What they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
Kill a motherfucka with the AK, what it's for
[?] on the board
[?] kill 'em when we forced to let it go
Bodies in the gutter, M.I.A. gon' let it go

[Post-Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Unh, I'ma let it go
Watch a nigga drop slow
Bodies flying everywhere
