[Intro]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
(Set it on fire
Let it go up in flames
Set it on fire
Let it go up in flames)

[Chorus]
Prada boys, nigga you are not the boy
Llama boy, you don't want no drama boy
Whole shoes, nigga you are not the choice
Designer boy, bet I make your momma moist
Prada boys, nigga you are not the boy
Llama boy, you don't want no drama boy
Whole shoes, nigga you are not the choice
Designer boy, bet I make your momma moist

[Verse 1]
She the bomb, told me she from Vietnam
Feed her charms try to tell her keep it calm
Tiffany's LV-utton
I'ma eat, where the grey poupon
I'm in the streets tryna get some croutons
I'm in the beam, somethin' with the roof gone
My enemies hate me cause I'm too on
She gon' get to choose on

[Interlude]
Set it on fire
Let it go up in flames
Set it on fire
Let it go up in flames

[Verse 2]
You wanna fuck me, where your friends at
Mommy, I ain't gon' lie girl them thighs got me tempted
We can do it in the kitchen
Whip cream on the side, you could get it need the chitlins
Baby I can see the vision
We could do it on the boat, Jay-Z Big Pimpin'
Come on momma why you riffin'?
Go and bust that ass while I laugh, Eddie Griffin

[Chorus]
Prada boys, nigga you are not the boy
Llama boy, you don't want no drama boy
Whole shoes, nigga you are not the choice
Designer boy, bet I make your momma moist
Prada boys, nigga you are not the boy
Llama boy, you don't want no drama boy
Whole shoes, nigga you are not the choice
Designer boy, bet I make your momma moist
