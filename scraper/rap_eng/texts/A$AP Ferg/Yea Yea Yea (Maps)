[Verse 1: A$AP Twelvyy]
Shawty information ain't no conversation
Ain't no information why you contemplatin'?
Patient through the drama now it's domination
Acid with Nirvana what a combination
Hit from little Ronda now I'm on vacation
Miss's talkin' commas probably fornicatin'
Witcho' baby momma she a dominatrix
Open up the knowledge what's the situation?
No a catalog, watch the dragon ball, I ain't mad at ya'll
Adderall, savage matador, flippin' adderall, gotta have it all
I ain't looking back, fuck the back and forth, gotta have it all
Gotta have a ball, aye

Why you instigatin' , catch me hydroplaning down the interstate
It's a dinner date, bitter great, got exquisite taste
Fuck a layaway, bitch I got it that's everyday
Ain't no indication automatic, what's the situation?
Fuck the speculation Twelvyy, got it, this my federation
Droppin' out of college, still high don't miss a education
If you got a dollar you could holla' , that's a conversation
No one's a better star than Fraud, running constellation
