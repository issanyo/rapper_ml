[Verse 1 : Bodega Bamz]
I used to stand on the corner with that Enyce Velour
I told these bitches we Kings like homie C-Webb, four
So now I live by the sword, keep the Techs lock my door
Back in Two-Thousand-Uno we catching homis for sure
Mercedes CL sixes, make your wifey my misses
Get a cigarette & condom after cleaning my dishes
I said "Mi nombre es Bodega" she said "I know like the store"
I said "I rap like Toronto" she told me "Start up a tour"
I use the ki's to get money now I'm kickin' down doors
A drug dealing Robin Hood, my Civic touching the floor
Your bitch ridin' my stick, so hard she blew my exhaust
I made it flip like '96 Olympics Dominique Dawes

Congrats to the fools that said I would not make it
Never get a shot so Papi had to take it
Many way might end I was patiently waiting
Listening to Cam, Big L, Pastor Hastings
A$AP Mob with the Tan Boy nation
Run New-York, who the fuck is you racing ?
Never stay stagnant, back & forth pacing
Eastburgh tree, tree, tree, my faaavorite

[Hook x4 : A$AP Ferg]
Young trap Lords, ridin' in the streets
Young Bamalier finna blam you with heat

[Verse 2 : A$AP Ferg]
Line 'em up, take 'em down
Two bad bitches on my couch
Sippin on the Henny make a nigga go oh
Had a little sex but I really want mouth
You know me, Young Trap Lord
White gold teeth you can't afford
Margiela so fuck the floor
Tote that fuck a nigga gon' fall
Homie wake up when he hear that four
Get sprayed up like his cologne
Won't let up when I pick that chrome
I can see his chromosome
With the smell of yo guts outside of your home
Within a couple of months your body got swolled
With couple of bugs coming out of your nose
Nigga who did it ? Nobody done know

[Hook x4]
