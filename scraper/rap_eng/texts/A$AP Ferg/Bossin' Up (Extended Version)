Stay fired up like arson, you can't touch my garments
Up late nights pass Carson, drinkin' large proportions

Shakin' that ass listening to Luke
Give a nigga all hole, no loops
Give a nigga all brain, no lip
I be at the ball hanging, no grip
Pants saggin' on four fifth
My security bullets like 4 inches
Kick that shit like four ninjas
Did that shit for my niggas who
Made it out the hood to the good side

You heard it through the grapevine and I was actually there
Yeah, It's clear who's been gettin' to the bread like Panera, ugh

Here we go again (gain), given in to sin
So sincere since last night, til 6 going in
Sunshine, see the glare (glare), no we ain't playing fair (no)
