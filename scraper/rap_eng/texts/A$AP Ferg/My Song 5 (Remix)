[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
Talk to me nice or don’t talk to me

[Verse 1: Haim]
I found it hard, tried to reserve
I’ll get it right when I am hurt
(Hot for me)
Romance is on
(Hot for me)
To her he’ll go
(Hot for me)
But I’ll be fine
(Hot for me)
‘Cause I know

[Pre-Hook: Haim]
He’s in her heart, on the floor thinkin' that I’ll never know
I’ll be up going through crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head seein' all the words I’ve said
Honey, honey I am never coming home again

[Hook: Haim]
I’ve been lied to
So what’s the truth?
No I'm not gonna hide it all, keeping it all from you
I’ve been dying to know what you tried
You’ve been lying so
Honey, I’m not your honey pie

[Bridge: Haim]
If you want to see me, baby please
Been holding for on eternity
Say you only want me
Missing you never led to much of anything
If you wanna know, if you wanna show me
Everything’s what it seems, seems to be
Held by a thread
Tried to forget
I-I’ll never let it go
Honey, I’m not your honey pie


[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Can you handle the truth? I don’t think you can
Jealous ‘cause I’m working with this female band
She wanna, consume the world and get all females banned
Always talk about marriage, I don’t see those plans
And yes, I cheated once and so did you
You let your girl eat you out like a bowl of soup
And how you didn't include master bruce?
Two girls in the nude I couldn’t wait to intrude
I couldn’t wait to penetrate the both of you two
You probably been scared I wasn’t noticing you
Scared I’d be occupied with your friend, my nose in the boobs
But, we ain't play that game cause we know you probably would lose
Honey pie, don’t front like you goodie-two-shoes
You ain’t got no money, how’d you get those shoes?
I put the clothes on your back, this the thanks I get?
Is this April? This must be a prank or some shit

[Pre-Hook: Haim]
He’s in her heart, on the floor thinkin' that I’ll never know
I’ll be up going through crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head seein' all the words I’ve said
Honey, honey I am never coming home again

[Hook: Haim]
I’ve been lied to
So what’s the truth?
No I'm not gonna hide it all, keeping it all from you
I’ve been dying to know what you tried
You’ve been lying so
Honey, I’m not your honey pie
