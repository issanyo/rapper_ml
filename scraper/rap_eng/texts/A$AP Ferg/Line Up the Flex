[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
Turn it down a little bit
Yeah, turn me up a little bit
Ferg, ay

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Line up the flex, line up the flex, (line up the flex)
Line up the flex, line up the flex, (line up the flex)
Line up the flex, line up the flex, (line up the flex)
Line up the flex, line up the flex, (line up the flex)
Line up the flex, line up the flex, (line up the flex)
Line up the flex, line up the flex, (line up the flex)
Line up the flex, line up the flex, (line up the flex)
Line up the flex, line up the flex, (line up the flex)

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Papa told me, "Keep it real", so I'ma keep it real
Yamborghini kept it trill and died off a pill
For my niggas in the field, those who rob and steal
You know Fergie got the juice, you 'bout to feel like steel
And now I'm 'bout to flex, I'm about to flex
I'm 'bout to cop the Lex, Ringwood double decks
My uncle had the tech in his mama's bed
My grandma had the llama, she was with the set
And now I'm 'bout to flex, why you so upset?
'Cause a couple bitches wet, they be with the sex
Marty with the set, Tory with the set
Did a deal with Adidas, but I'm gettin' checks

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Line up the flex, line up the flex, (line up the flex)
Line up the flex, line up the flex, (line up the flex)
Line up the flex, line up the flex, (line up the flex)
Line up the flex, line up the flex, (line up the flex)

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
I got a white bitch thicker than my black bitch
Her shit so dumb, I needed Fergie for the ad-lib (ahh)
This pinky ring on me, it cost a nigga 10 Hondas
I blew a 100k last week, that's on my dead mama
Look, I got 27 different hatin' niggas hatin' on me
And I'm just like, "Fuck 'em all"
Fergie tell these niggas how I sound
When I see 'em in the streets and brush 'em off
Fuck them niggas that was hatin' on me
Even though a nigga used to tell 'em all
I was never ever gang, gang, gang, gang
I was One Umbrella Mob
Juggin', cookin' in the hallway
Had to do this shit the hard way
Persistent little nigga
Now I'm steppin' off of Jimmy Kimmel in a Balmain
Big dog on campus, thick broad just landed
Swag-sharp like a jigsaw, send six off in your way, Fargo
