[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
That's right
Wooh
Wooh wooh wooh

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
I came through in a Benz Wagon, I'm on y'all neck
Get deep-throat while I'm on a boat, eatin' salmon croquettes
I'm in a big coat, I'm in a mink coat, my chain forgets
I'm sippin' Clicquot with a mean hoe, that gimme more sex
And my teeth glow, worth a kilo, but I need more cheques
And get the beat low, like a deep boat, and you know I'm cray
And getta' see notes, I'mma pop doors, in a four door Lex
You a weak hoe, need to take off, that fake Folex

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Fake hoe, all these fake hoes
Fake hoes, all these fake hoes
See you on Canal Street with the fake flows
Fake hoes, all these fake hoes
Fake hoes, fake hoes, fake hoes, fake hoes
Fake hoes, fake hoes, fake hoes, fake
Yeh I know, all fake hoes

[Verse 2: Creek Boyz]
I just mixed the xan with the molly
She a freak hoe I'm tryna feel her body
So I'mma work her out somethin' like pilates
And I ain't saver her to bitch for everybody
We gon' hit the party with them freak hoes
We gon' knock em' down like some free throws
Police tryna find me like I'm Nemo
Drugs and the smoke we don't reload

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Fake hoe, all these fake hoes
Fake hoes, all these fake hoes
See you on Canal Street with the fake flows
Fake hoes, all these fake hoes
Fake hoes, fake hoes, fake hoes, fake hoes
Fake hoes, fake hoes, fake hoes, fake
Yeh I know, all fake hoes
