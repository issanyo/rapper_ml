[Verse 1: ASAP Ferg]
My uncle did five, then he did ten, life in the pen
Sorry Trap Lord, committed a sin, I wanna repent
My flow gettin' hot, I'm the stocky 2Pac and the Biggie but slim
You talkin' you hot? But nigga you light, you don't wanna begin
And you wanna begin like a (?) Ferg (?) when I lift through the trunk of your Benz
Stuck like stick on a rim, that's what you fuckers get fuckin' with him
Bucket for bucket it's blood on the timbs, feelin' like Bird from above the rim
I'm the kind like flip, I'm the kind to make a motherfucker flip, ooh!
I'm the Trap Lord, he the Trap God, shit shot Gucci
When it come out might him 'em with a verse, but I be gettin' all mushy
ASAP Mob, I'm reppin' my gang like a nigga got the cooties
Joey go hard, reppin' that crib, my little brother get tooki
After they be mackin' money boy I'm never slackin'
Red Bo-bos, khakis, and his hair stay nappy
Young happy faced tatty when I walk in with the ratty
Need to put it down but it works like his daddy
That's me
He the boy that works like his daddy
And that niggas nasty, but he ain't really nasty

[Bridge:] x2
Young nigga spit that dope
Young nigga spit that dope
I be that Young nigga spittin' dope
Be that Young nigga spittin' dope
I be that Young nigga spittin' dope

[Outro:]
I spit dope like I'm Homer Simpson
A$AP Mob album, out ASAP
