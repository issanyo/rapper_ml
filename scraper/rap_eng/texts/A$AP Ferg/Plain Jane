[Intro]
*burps*
Sorry
Trust me
I'm a killer

[Hook]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Krane is the name, and Ferg just got my chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

[Verse 1]
I remember that day: I’m on stage with the Bombay
Bomb bass, children furious, they love my wordplay
Nickname, everybody scream my fucking rap name
D. Krane, when I get insane I grab a X-Ray
Vision from the Misfits bae, lady named J
It's her fucking birthday to-day, holy fuck, mane
She so fucking great, not pale and, uh, not plain
All my homies stay in front of gates and screaming "Hoo-ray!"
DJ, what the fuck to say? I'm tired of cliches
Mayday for the rhymaholic with a ashtray
Hey, Dre, ’member what the fuck I said in K12?
Nothing fucking changed, I'm late, so let me spray gays

[Hook]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Krane is the name, and Ferg just got my chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane, huh
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Krane is the name, and Ferg just got my chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane
Jane, Jane, ayy, ayy

[Bridge]
Suck my fucking dick or something (dick or something, dick or something)
Suck my fucking dick or something (dick or something, dick or something)
Suck my fucking dick or something
Yeah, suck my fucking dick or something

[Verse 2]
I'm fucking sick and tired of spitting bars without the venom
My verbal pistol on, I let you, bitches, say your prayers
These motherfucking haters talking shit about the greatest
Piss me off 24/7, fuck these bitches, I done lay them
In the concrete, fucking bitches think "Revival" can be hated
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with it? I know it can't be faded
Rhymes are perfect, flow is flawless, now you act like fucking ladies
'Cause I guess I'm at your motherfucking throat like chloraseptic
You want people love the greatest lyricists, but then what happens?
You pan the deepest album not because the style of rapping
It sound a bit old-fashioned, but it doesn't fucking matter
'Cause the only thing that mean shit is the raps of Mr. Mathers
Fucking critics call the lyrically perfect albums average
And give the better points to fucking garbage made by suckers
Well, fuck you, homos, you prefer to stay in fucking Matrix
But you suck a fucking dick, this joint is greater than "Illmatic"!

[Hook]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Krane is the name, and Ferg just got my chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane, huh
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Krane is the name, and Ferg just got my chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane
Jane, Jane, ayy, ayy

[Bridge]
Suck my fucking dick or something (dick or something, dick or something)
Suck my fucking dick or something (dick or something, dick or something)
Suck my fucking dick or something
Yeah, suck my fucking dick or something
