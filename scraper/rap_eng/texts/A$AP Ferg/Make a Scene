[Hook: Maad*Moiselle]
Neighborhood is rough and livin' ain't easy
Streets are so mean, 'bout to make a scene

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Ooh, come and fuck with the Trap Lord
In the neighborhood where all my neighbors hood
Come in your crib and they blast for us, for us
Flowers in your casket
Semi-auto Tec finna leave a nigga wet, you asked for it
For it tore him, bitch came to his crib to allure him
It was all a part of the forum
Fuck that nigga, take the stack and the Jordans
Get what you wanted, the bitch ain't important
You saying she fire, the devil be scorching
Say bye to your momma, say hi to the coffin
You die from that llama, you live near the Lord and
That why rain pouring, you in the sky with Whitney and Marvin
You do or die, be all in your touring
Claim you the shit, you get flushed in the toilet
Your crew ain't gon' ride then when you is comin
Who is this goon claiming he balling?
Two in your ride if you pump in the morning

[Hook: Maad*Moiselle]
Neighborhood is rough and livin' ain't easy
Streets are so mean, 'bout to make a scene

[Post-Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Riding with my top down 'bout to make a scene
Riding with my top down 'bout to make a scene
Riding with my top down 'bout to make a scene
Riding with my top down 'bout to make a scene
Riding with my top down 'bout to make a scene
Riding with my top down 'bout to make a scene
Riding with my top down 'bout to make a scene
Riding with my top down 'bout to make a scene

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Blocka-blocka like them shottas, hit your poppa and your mother
Let your brother lick the blood up, talking shit, you get another
(Motherfucker) Ready to start the ruckus
Take your supper, lit the snubbas if you talking like you tougher

[Hook: Maad*Moiselle]
Neighborhood is rough and livin' ain't easy
Streets are so mean, 'bout to make a scene
