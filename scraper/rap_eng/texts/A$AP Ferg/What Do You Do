[Chorus: NAV & A$AP Ferg]
What do you want?
Cut my grass low, see the snakes, all in my lawn
Tell me what you want, got a party inside my trunk
What do you want? All my haters mad that I'm on
A$AP with XO, tell me what else do you want?
What do you want
Is it a car, with the stars?
Tell me what you want, what do you want?
What do you want?
XO with A$AP, tell me what else do you want?

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
She licking the tip, she put it on her tongue
She smoking my dick, she coughing up her lung
Please don't run, please don't run
She open her leg, I eat that thing for lunch
I get in her zone, I give her the bone, I tell her, "Let's have fun"
A couple of rounds, a 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1
They come to my house, that booty bounces like it's 3 to 1
Feeling my touch, fucking that bitch and she's licking my nuts
It's no love, riding that coupe 'cause she's filling my life
Baby it's my life, snakes in that grass and I tell you no lie
You ride or die, tonight
Don't tell me no lie, look in my eye

[Chorus: NAV & A$AP Ferg]
What do you want?
Cut my grass low, see the snakes, all in my lawn
Tell me what you want, got a party inside my trunk
What do you want? All my haters mad that I'm on
A$AP with XO, tell me what else do you want?
What do you want?
Is it a car, with the stars?
Tell me what you want, what do you want?
What do you want?
XO with A$AP, tell me what else do you want?

[Verse 2: NAV]
Try to diss me and take my lane, you won't go far
Got an ounce and the hammer wrist out my Goyard
Went from one papers to smoking by the jar
Just cause it's Japanese don't mean that that's a foreign car
Growing up in Southside Rexdale wasn't fun
Just happy walking on some people on the run
Shouldn't have a clean record with the shit I've done
I won't say shit cause I know how to bite my tongue
I flew Frost to L.A. when he landed, get whatever he want
I'm smoking by the pound, with him, I'm smoking by the ton
Gave him a diamond chain cause I'ma make another one
Switch your girl, she saw me in a Ghost, I asked her what she want

[Chorus: NAV & A$AP Ferg]
Cut my grass low, see the snakes, all in my lawn
Tell me what you want, got a party inside my trunk
What do you want? All my haters mad that I'm on
A$AP with XO, tell me what else do you want?
What do you want?
Is it a car, with the stars?
Tell me what you want, what do you want?
What do you wantXO with A$AP, tell me what else do you want?
