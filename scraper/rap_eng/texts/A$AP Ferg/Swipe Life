[Intro]
Fake nigga
(DJ SpinKing baby)

[Verse 1]
Bitches with me in the club, all the models around
(Bitch) sip from the bottle girl, all the bottles around
Scrub me a brand new Beamer, so I stunt when I come around
Fuck all my enemies, all messed up when I come around

[Hook]
Hunnids off a swipe
Got a couple hunnid off a swipe (Swipe)
Bought a Bentley on a swipe (Swipe life)
Got two rollies off a swipe (Swipe)
Hold it, hold it, swipe life, swipe life (Swipe)

Whenever I put it down
(Fuck) fuck all my enemies
Whenever they come around

[Verse 2]
My homie done did a year
Nigga you held it down

[Verse 3]
Had 'em all up in my Coup√©
(Skeet) skeet is all up on her tooth
(Beeper) beeper goes off I'm like Ooh
(Why) why I go off on her glutes
Better be watchin' your tongue when you speak
Don't even talk to me please
(I) I  keep the banger on me
Swipe and get all of my cheese
I bought my momma a new house
I bought my bitch a new dog
I brought the trap to the house
Bow when you talk to the Lord
I come through with a banger, nigga
And I put a big diamond on the finger, nigga
And you know all the bad bitches hangin' with us
Couple rappers couldn't even get a table with us
Couple Henny niggas always tellin' fables on us
Can't sell the money, turn the tables on us
But fuck it I'mma keep the money real tight
Cause I gotta keep her bangin' with a hunnid swipes
Hunnid swipes

[Hook]
Got a couple hunnid off a swipe (Swipe)
Bought a Bentley on a swipe (Swipe life)
Got two rollies off a swipe (Swipe)
Hold it, hold it, swipe life, (Swipe)
