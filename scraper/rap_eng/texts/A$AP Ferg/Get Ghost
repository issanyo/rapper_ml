[Verse 1: Passion Pit]
Who you gonna call when you feel all pent up inside your head?
Do you wanna know how the story goes or make it up instead?
You're complicated, scares us to the bone
But no one says you’re better off alone

[Chorus: Passion Pit]
I got that ghost, that ghost, is scarin’ you the most
I got that ghost, that ghost, is scarin’ you the most
I got that ghost, that ghost, is scarin’ you the most
That spirit you harbor in your bones
I think that, I got that, I got that, that, that, that
Life is what you fear the most, but don’t forget your girlfriend
(Get ghost
Get ghost
Get ghost
Get ghost)

[Verse 2: Passion Pit]
Lie there in the middle, makes you feel just a little like liftin' off the ground
Fillin' that bowl when the party’s full and you just got to get out
Oh, you're in no position, call the other now
Funny how you’re callin’ on us now

[Chorus: Passion Pit]
I got that ghost, that ghost, is scarin’ you the most
I got that ghost, that ghost, is scarin’ you the most
I got that ghost, that ghost, is scarin’ you the most
That spirit you harbor in your bones
I think that, I got that, I got that, that, that, that
Life is what you fear the most, but don’t forget your girlfriend
(Get ghost
Get ghost
Get ghost
Get ghost)

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
When you start getting done it’s time to get ghost
Everybody ‘round you start doin’ the most
Everybody pullin’ up with they hands out
Wasn’t with me, now they wanna be my friend now
Ay, wanna hold a couple bands now
Bet all the bad girls be callin’ you now
Took ‘em all they wanna see while you in town
But I’m busy gettin' ghost, I ain’t never around
I get ghost with the big checks
Ghost Phantom when I’m handlin' my business
(Skert) Move out the way ‘cause I’m drivin' crazy
All these girls- girls date me
But it really makes me feel good
Yeah, ghost, yeah

[Chorus: Passion Pit]
(Get ghost
Get ghost
Get ghost
Get ghost
Get ghost
Get ghost
Get ghost
Get ghost
Get ghost)
