[Hook: Sevdaliza]
He never knew what I was made of
Heat couldn't melt me, cold couldn't waver me
He never knew my form or shape
His heart couldn't melt me, water couldn't bathe me
Caught him gambling with a snare
He took me all the way in despair
Operating from another world
I want to be that other girl

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Well, tell me how you feel about me now
Gold Rollie on the wrist, fifty thou'
Finna run off with the pound
Finna run up on the plug
I wanna fuck she want hug
Got a couple models with the dogs
Pop a couple bottles in the club
You niggas don't get no love
You all on me in the club
At the Four Seasons, the big suite
All my friends gone off the drugs
Wait a minute let me finish
Let me put my gold grill in
'Cause you with a V-Lone thug
[?]
[?] spilling lean on us
I got me [?] I pass it to the homie 'cause you know we don't [?]
Fergie be wildin' I'm [?] like I'm a [?]

[Hook: Sevdaliza]
He never knew what I was made of
Heat couldn't melt me, cold couldn't waver me
He never knew my form or shape
His heart couldn't melt me, water couldn't bathe me
Caught him gambling with a snare
He took me all the way in despair
Operating from another world
I want to be that other girl

[Outro]
(Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be)
I want to be that other girl
That other girl
Want to be that other girl
