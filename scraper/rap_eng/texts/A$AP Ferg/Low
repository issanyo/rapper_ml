[Intro: Frank Casino]
Whoa, whoa
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa
Whoa oh, whoa oh

[Hook: Frank Casino]
I'm so make believe
I came off the raps like christmas eve
I came here to give them what they need
How they poppin' when they move low-key
Man, they move low- key, whoa

Low oh, low oh whoa
Low oh, low oh whoa
Low oh, low oh whoa
Low oh, low oh

[Verse 1: Frank Casino]
I came to finesse
Tell em' do more and talk less
I can never worry bout' your set
Promise there's no worries from my set
I always got the set, whoa
And we rollin' like the Trojans
Keep it 300 stay blunted from the tree, sheesh, sheesh, potent
JHB' city where I'm located
Centrefold girls I ain't posting
I came with a dream and a token
Ai yi, bad maan
From Camps Bay, baby to Sandton
Had them going crazy from Kempton
And they yellin' that boy's so handsome
Just keep on bring the anthems
Only thing on my memorandum
Ey, whoa, they see us but never see us
Turn critics to believers
All my divas got visa
Ey, Tahiraa, Tianna, Aqheela
Take your shot of tequila
Fill that kidney with killer, we see ya'

On the flipside, look at how your favorite women all switched sides
Makaveli bandana, nigga thug life
The priceless moment comes at a good price, nigga eastside
Where the shooters do the shooting, nigga on site
We ain't never been the side to go opposite
I know people that would die to live this life, looks good right?
Check up on you when I got my check right
And my check type, gotta be black when I'm on that Off-White
Christian Bale, place the bets man, dark knight
Nigga, thug life, whoa

[Bridge: Frank Casino]
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa
Whoa oh, whoa oh

[Hook: Frank Casino]
I'm so make believe
I came off the raps like christmas eve
I came here to give them what they need
How they poppin' when they move low-key
Man, they move low- key, whoa

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Heard my enemies gon' make me plead
I'ma get your wife and I'ma hit it right
I seen her sitting in nose bleed
Give her kitty a shrine
Put it in her spine
Causing casualities
I'ma put it in her guts screaming my oh my
Oh please, oh please yeah
When I walk up to the club my diamonds dancing
Couple of hoes pulled up now I'm prancing
Now I'm feeling on her butt she saying that's it
Sipping on that Henny in a cup losing vision
All you niggas hating wanna be us
I'ma call you Ryu cannot see us, no
Once you stop watching then get your cheese up
It's niggaraci and Frank Casino

[Hook: Frank Casino]
I'm so make believe
I came off the raps like christmas eve
I came here to give them what they need
How they poppin' when they move low-key
Man, they move low- key, whoa
