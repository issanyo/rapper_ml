[A$AP Ferg]
Our Lord, Jesus, please be with us
Um, there's a lot of us here today, um
I'm in good spirits right now, ‘cause I know my brothers is here with me
Um, I know, know the Tanboys came to shut it down, son, you gotta shut it down
You know what I'm saying, and keep the bar high
That's what the people came here to do
I was hoping that we could be professional, run around and make this money and go by the business
So Lord Jesus, please be with us, amen

[Group]
Amen
