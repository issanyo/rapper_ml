[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
Mattress, mattress, mattress
Mattress, mattress, mattress, mattress
Mattress, mattress, mattress

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Came a long way from the mattress
Boy, I used to jump on the mattress
And I used to hump on the mattress
My grandma kept the gun in the mattress
My uncle kept O's in the mattress
Flippin' the work like gymnastics
Pitchin' the crack, it do backflips
Po-po was flipping the mattress

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Psycho gun in the mattress
Grandma pass it and he blast it
I came on your bitch, I'm a savage
She stretchin' my dick like elastic
She made it disappear like magic
Bed bugs crept in the mattress
Came a long way from the mattress
Used to lay on a rug like Aladdin
Yeah, huh, now I'm like King Tut
You cuffin' that bitch but she smuttin'
She fucked the whole block, I ain't bluffin'
Trap Lord meaner than the mug
Wake the niggas up like Folgers in a cup
Tec go buh-buh
Don't ever let it get fucked up

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Came a long way from the mattress
Boy, I used to jump on the mattress
And I used to hump on the mattress
My grandma kept the gun in the mattress
My uncle kept O's in the mattress
Flippin' the work like gymnastics
Pitchin' the crack, it do backflips
Po-po was flipping the mattress

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky, A$AP Ferg & Both]
Did backflips on the mattress
Did mad shit on the mattress
Where the magic happens? On the mattress
Two ratchet fat chicks on the mattress (ooh)
A nigga stashed G's in the mattress (ooh)
Fuckin' all they bitches on the mattress (uhh)
Bendin' all these bitches over backwards (yeah)
LSD and the acid
Wrote mad rhymes on the mattress
Fuck mad times on the mattress
Only thing in my Margina mattress
Cause I came mad times on the mattress (ooh)
King size bed full of ashes
She smoke on my dick and don't pass it
I fuck mad dimes on my mattress
Yeah I fuck mad dimes on my mattress
Ass fat but her titty plastic
What can I say, man? I'm a jiggy bastard
Pretty motherfucker, I think I should join a pageant
For the salad, put a hole in his cabbage
Niggarace, new Versace 'Preme or the Palace
Fuckin' models, Flacko always schemin' on the talent
Cover of your favorite magazine and I'm stylin'
Fuck a horse-face bitch, but her body like a stallion
She swing on my dick like she Tarzan
Call me Coach Cartier cause I'm ballin'
My stones look deformed like retarded
What's the name? Those Balmain? How you call it?
She suck on my dick while I'm yawnin'
She missin' the D, now she moanin'
Her ass fatter than Action Bronson (pause)
She top me like top of the mornin'
Niggarace told me to, oh shit
Niggarace told me, give me Rocky
Cause you know it's Flacko Jodye, icy papi
While you watchin', copy, niggas copy copy
I ride down, sloppy toppy
When she love a nigga mane, we them niggas now
International, had em going wild
Trap jumpin' nigga, block bunkin' nigga

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Came a long way from the mattress
Boy, I used to jump on the mattress
And I used to hump on the mattress
My grandma kept the gun in the mattress
My uncle kept O's in the mattress
Flippin' the work like gymnastics
Pitchin' the crack, it do backflips
Po-po was flipping the mattress

[Verse 3: Famous Dex & Rich The Kid]
Big bank roll in the mattress (it is)
Bitch bad, make it do a backflip (bitch)
I fuck that bitch, make her hair twist (a-what)
Hunnid band cash in the mattress (what)
Wait, momma said boy "fix that mattress" (uh, mama)
Rich nigga, they gon' put me on the Forbes list (rich)

[Verse 4: Playboi Carti]
I fuck that bitch on the mattress
She suck my dick on the mattress

I heard you just walked in with catfish
All of my bitches look ah
All of your bitches look average

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
