[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
Yeah, I need everybody to open this shit up
Everybody open this fucking shit up
Yeah, Constantine, yeah

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Fuck that shit, we get turnt 'til the sun is up
All of you niggas get burnt when the gun is up
This that East Coast, mothafucka
Call me Mr. East Coast, mothafucka
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Fuck that shit, we get turnt 'til the sun is up
All of you niggas get burnt when the gun is up
This that East Coast, mothafucka
Call me Mr. East Coast, mothafucka

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
This that ground zero music, sit and listen to it
This the children of the sewer, finally winnin' music
This confessions of a lord, I've been sinnin' music
The rap book is my Bible, just repentin' through it
I jump in the whip and say, "Ooh, it's my shit"
And I tell 'em to turn it up (skrrt)
Jump in the pit and start moshing the shit
And I tell 'em to burn it up
This is Mr. Trap Lord, I'ma go in 'til the sun is up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run 'til I fuck it up

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg & Remy Ma]
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Fuck that shit, we get turnt 'til the sun is up
All of you niggas get burnt when the gun is up
This that East Coast, mothafucka
Call me Mr. East Coast, mothafucka
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Fuck that shit, we get turnt 'til the sun is up
All of you niggas get burnt when the gun is up
This that East Coast, mothafucka (hahahahah)
Call me Mr. East Coast, mothafucka (Remy, Ma)

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
And it’s 0-1, now, run it up
Got my face beat, hair done it up
I go bad on ‘em, drop bags on 'em
Got a tab, bitch; tell 'em run it up
I spaz on 'em, I gun 'em up
Said I’m too smart, gotta dumb it up
Dead in the middle of Little Italy
They ain’t know Remy really could just Pun it up
On IG, you thumb it up
But in real life, you bum it up
You don't own nothin’, you so frontin'
You Joe Budden, you pump it up
See, these hoes be luckin' up
Try to be down, they suckin' up
I go nuts, I mean pecan
Turn the beat on and I fuck it up
The bar’s low, I brung it up
And y'all hoes just stunk it up
I been one, you been done
You been shoulda just hung it up
You was hatin' when I was comin' up
You fake bitch, you need to woman up
You a wack bitch, you a rat bitch
And I’m that bitch, just to sum it up

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Fuck that shit, we get turnt ‘til the sun is up
All of you niggas get burnt when the gun is up
This that East Coast, mothafucka
Call me Mr. East Coast, mothafucka
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Fuck that shit, we get turnt 'til the sun is up
All of you niggas get burnt when the gun is up
This that East Coast, mothafucka
Call me Mr. East Coast, mothafucka

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
Yeah, send 'em through the ceiling, throw a nigga off the building
I'll kill 'em, they'll never find out
Fuck what you feelin', Trap Lord in the building
With the lords and they with it right now
Pull up on them niggas like "skrrt" and I murk
And them jerks see the bad man comin'
Dump if a nigga say dumb
And pump, have the best of the bad boys runnin'
Jump if you ready to fuck this shit up
And get knuck if you buck if you thuggin'
Jump if you ready to fuck a pig up
'Cause he cuff a nigga up for nothin'
Know some children that'll hold the thang
And they let it bang 'cause you frontin'
Jump 'cause I'm feelin' like I'm the illest nigga
I'm the trillest and I love it
Push the Benz like it's nothin' (woo)
Versace lens like it's nothin' (woo)
Fuck a 10 like it's nothin' (woo)
Fuck her friend like it's nothin' (woo)
Bitches with it like it's nothin' (woo)
Suck them titties like it's nothin' (woo)
Face a bottle like it's nothin' (woo)
Tap a model like it's nothin' (woo)

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Fuck that shit, we get turnt 'til the sun is up
All of you niggas get burnt when the gun is up
This that East Coast, mothafucka
Call me Mr. East Coast, mothafucka
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Fuck that shit, we get turnt 'til the sun is up
All of you niggas get burnt when the gun is up
This that East Coast, mothafucka
Call me Mr. East Coast, mothafucka
