[Verse 1]
They told me West got robbed (Damn)
Where the fuck them niggas be at?
They took the chain up off his neck
I heard the mac started running laps
Oh, what the fuck, how they gon' do that?
My nigga got stuffed, he didn't wanna view that
I heard they had guns, they ain't wanna use that
They ain't wanna see Tom in the fucking boo cap
What about Lil Mitt, where the fuck he was at?
That nigga too little, they ain't wanna do that
But he got more heart than most of them cats
If he had that thing, that thing go blat
Lil young trap lord with a little backpack
Feel at his pulse with a bunch of big gats
They ain't wanna do that

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Semi or the TEC, guns gon' flirt
Semi or the TEC, guns gon' flirt
Semi or the TEC, guns gon' flirt
Semi or the TEC, guns gon' flirt
And another one squirt

[Verse 2]
Revenge is on my mind
And now they got my brother
Thinking about picking up the nine
And making them fuckers lick the blood up
There's no need for wasting time
Niggas gon' get it one way or another
You want to live the street life
Go ahead, go ahead
Your wig get blown living that street life
You can't live long living that street life
Got to watch your moms in this street life
They'll come to your home in this street life
Full clip from the chrome, living that street life
Your chromosomes all on the streetlights
Lights, somebody gon' die
Body on ice, right
