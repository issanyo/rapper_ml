[Hook]
Everybody going to this cocaine castle
You'll probably see your reverend at this cocaine castle
Pimps and prostitutes at this cocaine castle
Doctors in their suits at this cocaine castle
Babies in they pampers at this cocaine castle
Crying with they grandma at this cocaine castle
Momma doing drugs at this cocaine castle
Tryna get some buzz at this cocaine castle

[Verse 1]
All another day in the crack house, where demons be talking to fiends
Couple hits and they blackout, needles be stuck all in their veins
Au revoir, sing a song that be stuck all in your brain
That shit so potent, it have you doing devilish things, yeah
Take a walk through the darkside, where a nigga don't see no light
One hit is all I need, that nigga gon' take your life
What about your wife? What about your kids?
What about your crib? What about your moms? What about her tears?
What about that shit? What about your uncle? He died last year
From the same thing, you kissed that glass to hide your fears
Bring nothing to your life, you die, you die
Basing your life upon the hope that you gon' get the same high

[Interlude]
I remember when I was, when I was lit the fuck up
I was, I just, I just, I just remember that day
I remember what it feels like

[Verse 2]
Tripping off this weed got a nigga slow motion
Chills all over my body like some cold lotion
Tryna wrestle demons like I'm fucking Hulk Hogan
Looking for the cure but I'm seeing no potion
Tryna sleep it off but it only gets worse
Seems like my whole life fucking been cursed
Devil tryna get me in this fucking paradise
Fucking all these bitches raw just to roll the dice

[Breakdown]

[Outro]
Why you in my dreams?
Why you in my dreams?
Why you in my dreams?
Why you all in my dreams?
