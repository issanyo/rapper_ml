I don't care who shot you, I don't care who popped you
I don't care who robbed you, silly nigga, I'm not you
I don't care who robbed you, turn you into a fossil
Now all you niggas scared ‘cause you know I'm a mob dude
I don't care who shot you, I don't care who popped you
I don't care who robbed you, silly nigga, I'm not you
I don't care who robbed you, turn you into a fossil
Now you niggas is scared ‘cause you know I'm a mob dude

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
I put a couple bands up on your head
Tell 'em, hit you with five shots 'til you dead
One through the arm, then one through the leg
The other three come later right after you dead
Tell me how you feel with your life in my palm
Kiss the ring, Corleone, just announce me The Don
Sit back in my three-piece-suit, sipping [?]
We know who did it, we just remaining calm
I got some infiltrators that be after my paper
I put some money on his head ‘cause he show me his anus
How you bite on the hand that feed you? Don't believe you
I can tell by the look in your eyes, you livin' evil
I'm just giving you a teaspoon
See, my heart colder than a igloo
Once he was my brother, now he is a sucker
Long kiss, now it's time to kill this motherfucker

[Hook: Marty Baller]
I don't care who shot you, I don't care who popped you
I don't care who robbed you, silly nigga, I'm not you
I don't care who robbed you, turn you into a fossil
Now all you niggas scared ‘cause you know I'm a mob dude
I don't care who shot you, I don't care who popped you
I don't care who robbed you, silly nigga, I'm not you
I don't care who robbed you, turn you into a fossil
Now you niggas is scared ‘cause you know I'm a mob dude

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
That be the same niggas that you grew up with
Two-cup with, that one nigga you fuck with
Ain't have money for food and shit, two bucks with
Now he looking at you like he got too much shit
Be the same nigga that'd go and hug your momma
Same nigga that you would call when you run into drama
Trust wasn't the issue, we was riding with honor
Then you started moving funny, I still loved you regardless
Yeah, I had to take a step back and look at the problem
Had to, clear my mind from all the mirages
Yeah, you betrayed a nigga, think I don't know?
Don't be surprised if you see some niggas at your door (Blaw!)

[Hook: Marty Baller]

Now you niggas is scared ‘cause you know I'm a mob dude
