[Verse 1]
I've been coming out to LA, to make headlines
I ain't tryna do the basic life that nine to five
Ooh heard about me through the grapevine
Ooh while you sleeping I'm be on my grind like
Woo!

[Chorus]
Everyday, everyday
I'll be on my way
On my way, on my way
Do this everyday
I don't need that liquor up in my blood
I don't need that weed all up in my lungs
Everyday, everyday
I'll be on my way
On my way, on my way
Do this everyday
You just blowin' smoke while I'm blowin' up
Everyday, everyday
I'll be on my way

[Verse 2]
I'll be on that come up shit since 99'
If you're trying to come for me don't waste your time
Ooh heard about me through the grapevine
Ooh while you sleeping I'm be on my grind like
Woo!

[Chorus]
Everyday, everyday
I'll be on my way
On my way, on my way
Do this everyday
I don't need that liquor up in my blood
I don't need that weed all up in my lungs
Everyday, everyday
I'll be on my way
On my way, on my way
Do this everyday
You just blowin' smoke while I'm blowin' up
Everyday, everyday
I'll be on my way

[Bridge]
I don't need that liquor up in my blood
I don't need that weed all up in my lungs
You just blowin' smoke while I'm blowin' up
While you sleeping I've be on my grind like

[Chorus]
Everyday, everyday
I'll be on my way
On my way, on my way
Do this everyday
I don't need that liquor up in my blood
I don't need that weed all up in my lungs
Everyday, everyday
I'll be on my way
On my way, on my way
Do this everyday
You just blowin' smoke while I'm blowin' up
Everyday, everyday
I'll be on my way
