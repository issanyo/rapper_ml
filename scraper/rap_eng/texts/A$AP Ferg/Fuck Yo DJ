[Verse 1: Good Joon]
Fuck yo DJ
It's all about my producer
All my niggas looking at commas, commas, commas
Trynna plot against the team man, it’s useless
Niggas stick together, we ain’t stopping, stopping, stopping
We got goon niggas
No foof niggas
All my niggas are lockin up what they believe in
Give a fuck what you think is the truth
Nigga, I don't got no limits, I'm 'bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it
Ain't no bitch in me but the bitch in her say she feelin' me and
I don't doubt probably cause the last nigga I seen
[?] we them niggas and you know this (yup)
Still can't trust a bitch is our motive (nope)
All these bitches getting tricky, I know this (yup)
Niggas saying we ain't getting money, they bogus (nope)
'Cause my producer, my producer, my producer, my producer

[Hook: Good Joon]
Fuck yo DJ
Fuck, fuck, fuck yo
Fuck, fuck, fuck yo
Fuck, fuck, fuck yo DJ
Fuck, fuck, fuck yo
Fuck, fuck, fuck yo
Fuck, yo, fuck yo DJ


[Verse 2: P]
Yea, fuck em'
And them hoes too [?] don't love em
Get turnt up when I'm up in the function
Jumpin, jumpin, jumpin, jumpin
Fuck em' yo producer and yo mixtape
5'9" walk around like I'm 6'8"
I ain't worried 'bout nothin', my shit straight
Kick a bitch to the curb if she can't pay tax
I ain't waitin' on Obama
Spent that last month on marijuana
These niggas don't want no problem
I put that on my mothafuckin' momma
Took a flick with yo bitch, yeah you see me
Got a couple young niggas wanna be me
My shit bang, got it on repeat
'Cause my producer, my producer, my producer, my producer

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
Walk in the club my [?] linguine
Pushin' bitches out I got [?] weewee
Eat that pussy in the club, like a panini
A couple haters in the back, they can look, they don't see me
I got alot of herbs, mom and daddy got alot of drugs
She hidin', Tony Montana when he off alot of blow
[?] when they stoppin OverDoz
I be sippin' Tylenol, I can hit another tho
I'm walkin' in this club all alone
I'm fuckin' bumping and hoping the DJ playing my song
I feel like I'm in a movie when he be playin my song
I hope these gangstas be killin' niggas that I never loved
My DJ going crazy
Bumping so hard almost had me a baby
Got me bumping and grinding like I be back in the 80's
Feeling like I'm Richard Porter when he was driving Mercedes
I'm sipping Hennessy, like 2Pac
But me and yo bitch in the drop taking two shots
My DJ in the back with about two thots
If you’re looking for hit records, my DJ got alot

[Verse 3: Kent Jamz]
I ain't got time for these bitches
And I don't fuck with none of these broke ass niggas
I ain't got time for these bitches
And I don't fuck with none of these broke ass niggas
I ain't got time for these bitches
And I don't fuck with none of these broke ass niggas
I ain't got time for these bitches
And I don't fuck with none of these broke ass niggas
I don't do coke, I bought it for the models
In the V.I.P pourin' codeine, bottle after bottle
Singin', "Fuck yo DJ, fuck yo DJ"
All I do is daydream about pirate green
Trynna make Rihanna my baby mama
Spent yo rent on my jeans
Pour Ciroc, I take shots of codeine and I promise
I ain't got time for these bitches
And I don't fuck with none of these broke ass niggas
I ain't got time for these bitches
And I don't fuck with none of these broke ass niggas
I ain't got time for these bitches
And I don't fuck with none of these broke ass niggas
I ain't got time for these bitches
And I don't fuck with none of these broke ass niggas
Yo in the V.I.P. singing off-key
With my niggas like, "Fuck yo DJ, fuck yo DJ"
Singing with my homies off-key
Like, "Fuck yo DJ, fuck yo DJ"
