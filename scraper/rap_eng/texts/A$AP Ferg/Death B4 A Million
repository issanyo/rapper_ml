[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Don't wish me death before I see a million
Before I see these hoes and I'm up there tell my mom that I lived it
Before they dunk a flow, motherfuckers wanna talk but think they live it, no
I be ballin' stuck up in this pivot, where you trying to go?
Stuck up in this lavish living
Fucking with ghetto hoes truth be told it's money over bitches
Gotta get this dough I'm alone in this cold world
Let's go home cause we grown girl, let's get it on

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Being broke this shit ain't fucking pleasant
My daddy showed me lots of money at the age of 7
Before he went to heaven
Papa knew I'd be this way
Fucking with different bitches
To bad he couldn't see the day
But he still watching over me
The devil try to take my wings
Bounce him over the head if he stand before me, shit
I floss with nothing but the real Gs, only real niggas
Introduced me to Supreme team, yeah them real killers
And I layed a couple niggas down for the real figures
I was born in this shit thats why I claim to be the realest nigga
Choppin' it up with all of the thugs
Mobbin' it up with all of the bloods
Bicin' it up with all of the homies
Sippin' it up with all the broads
How many times I've dreamed of cars
Dreams of me living large
Big stars like El Debarge
Money not a thing I'm grinding hard
Lord,.. deliver me my wishes please
I've been eating all this time can y'all niggas do the dishes, please

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Flossing diamonds to make them hate me more
Fuck the enemy
Die a slow death while you envy me
And I be ballin' like the MVPs
Motherfuckers cross me, now they're begging for my sympathy
Dreaming of millions of dollars and making bitches holla
Purple label collars and nothing but Devoni from product
Devonian nature got me caking
Every star you wanna see, in the belt, nigga I'm a make it
Stuck up in this californication
Got all the bad bitches swiping cards for that medication
And I get high, that's my meditation
All this determination got me
What in the world, nigga I'm a take it
So, give me what you got while I'm making it hot
Escalating to the top getting money 'til I drop
Sprinkle lavender then I roll up and I'm tippin'
Reminiscing on how the real Gs fuckin' did it
Thieving on niggas

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
I be on the same shit Master Farak was teaching Elijah
I be with the same click shout outs to Bari and Elijah
Shout outs to Dev the young messiah
Shout outs to all of the young disciples
Shout outs to Rocky for pumpin' the fire
Toast up to the most high for making us higher
Those in the skies to the angels above
Don't feel the cries of them niggas below
Rollin' my eyes to the back of my dome
But I take one poke cause I don't really smoke
Hell if I could then I'd take one toke
Cause all of this pain ain't no joke
I feel the rain but my clothes ain't soaked
It's just no grub but it ain't got dope
If there's no bub then I ain't go hoes
Bitches dont want a buck if it ain't got Os
They want Os at the end up the bub
They want the Benz with the rims so gold
They want gems with the fancy clothes
And they went ham with the fancy clothes
Money on my mind and I shine
So all my niggas knew that they could get dough
