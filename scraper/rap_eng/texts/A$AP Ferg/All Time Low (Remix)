[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
I was the knight in shining armor in your movie
Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
You're the reason I'm alone and masturbate

[Pre-Hook: Jon Bellion]
I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie, lie, l-lie I tried to hide
But now you know it

[Hook: Jon Bellion]
That I'm at an all time
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion]
I was the prototype like 3 Stacks on that CD
An example of the perfect candidate
Now all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me
You're the reason that I just can't concentrate

[Pre-Hook: Jon Bellion]
I, (I, I) I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie I tried to hide
But now you know it

[Hook: Jon Bellion]
That I'm at an all time
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
At first, I hesitated to give my love
She said, "Why you hesitatin' to give your love?"
Diamonds in my grills them white girls love
She said she never been in love with a thug (That's right!)
I'm so high, she is my drug (Yeah)
She's everything I want, so fuck the club (Ugh)
Pop bottles of the Ace to celebrate love (Ugh)
Cherry red petals surround the tub
My girl is so real 'cause she's so trill
Caught me in some situations but she know the deal (that's right!)
Them other girls sanitation, there was no relation
What we got is so amazin', you should just embrace it (Alright)
And face it, 'cause we fly so high
You be ridin' with them thighs, screamin',"Oh my God!"
She turned from a little daisy to a butter rose
Can't believe she got me at an all time low
Hey!

[Outro: Jon Bellion]
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
