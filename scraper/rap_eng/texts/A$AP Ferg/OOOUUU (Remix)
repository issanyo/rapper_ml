[Intro]
Ferg
M.A. what up?
Yeah, Harlem, Brooklyn, New York

[Verse]
Shout outs to my niggas with them felonies
They be runnin' through your hood for them accessories
I teach you how to be a player, Bill Bellamy
Funny cause I fucked that same bitch Headphanie
It's always in the rain when you see a player ridin' the Porsches
They'll never duck, got the Benzo up, they don't know what the cost is
Couple Wilhelmina model bitches with me, baby all of 'em whores
Shout out to my nigga Rick Ross but you know who the boss is
All my niggas winnin' and we celebratin' all of your losses
Marty, the Henny got me saucy
100 bands made the diamonds dance like Carlton Banks
Me and M.A. at the strip club blowin' all these Franks

[Outro]
OOOUUU
OOOUUU
Damn
