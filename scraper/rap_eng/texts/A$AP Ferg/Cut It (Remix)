[Intro]
Man, just cause we superstars and shit
They charging us an arm and a leg just to live, goddamn
Give me some type of bargain
Told my landlord that shit the other day, goddamn
I told my landlord the other day
Just because I'm a rapper don't try to motherfucking charge me an arm and a leg and a toe
Some extra fingers

[Hook]
That rent is way too high you need to cut it
My rent is way too high they need to cut it
Cut it uh, cut it uh
Cut it uh, cut it uh
My rent is way too high they need to cut it
(Don't try to charge an arm, leg)
My rent is way too high they need to cut it
(Don't try to charge me an arm, leg, and a goddamn ear)

[Verse 1]
I fucked the bitch in the club
I put my thumb in her butt
The DJ be playing my song
The bottle girls be showing me love
I be making it rain with the money
You niggas look funny and bummy
My bitch want to play with the bunnies
My bitches who dissing they cut it
I did a deal with Adidas
Fergy done got him a sneaker
If you need a better leader
I will teach you how to re-up
Get money flip get the Beamer
Yamborgini with Aaliyah
Rest in peace until I see ya
Album coming, this a teaser
She want to fuck me I'm a keeper
I smoke that pussy like some Cheeba
She like girls Queen Latifa
I'm living single like Khadija
I ain't with the cuffing shit neither
Oh my god I don't believe her
I might go pop for the guap
Do a song with Justin Bieber

[Interlude]
I told my goddamn landlord you need to cut my motherfucking rent
I'm a motherfucking rap star but goddamn
Cut that shit!

[Hook]
Cut it, cut it uh
Cut it, cut it uh
Cut it, cut it ya
(I just bought my momma a house)
The price is way too high they need to cut it
(She own that shit)
My rent is way too high they need to cut it
(I'm 'bout to buy me one too and own that shit)
