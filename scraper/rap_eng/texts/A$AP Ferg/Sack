[Intro]
Sack (x3)

[Hook: B-Real]
Who got the sack
All my niggas in the trap know where It's at
Blow when I go to my shows
We got the sack
Pull up to the club in the front, we in the back
Who got the sack

[Verse 1: B-Real]
You begging mothafuckas wanna hit on my sack
But you can't get none
I be rolling in packs every homie wanna act
Like they hit that blunt
Everybody need a hit when they see the Ziploc
Open up and they smell that flavor
See we got it in stock
And we put it in lock
Just Joints go by laser
Got that sack, put it in the trunk, got another cut of that fume
Open another bag, take another drag, hey bitch don't be a fool
Blaze up roll another ounce givin em bounce in very high amounts don't pass out
We killing everything, never spilling any cream, Top fill in my green bitch cash out
Let it be known, we staying in the zone, I'm rolling up a cone and waxed up
You ain't nothing but a cone, better check your tone, you be getting too blown, you maxed out
I be holding that shatter but it really doesn't matter my sack getting fatter your passed out

[Hook]

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
I don't smoke but she gave me a shotgun
CPR smoke all up in my lung
One hit a quitter I'm high as the sky son
I usually don't ain't tellin no lies hun
A quarter sack from L.A, that had me turnt
With a little paranoia had me feeling concern
The last time I smoked, I got burned
Chasing my tour bus in the woods they turned
Holy guacamole baby help me I'm high
Getting holy baby I could poke a hole in yo thigh
Real nigga shit, I could go to loki some time
Hit you from the back then I put it all in yo spine
Matter fact all of your mind
Just a little head, coming all in yo eye
I'm kinda like the rodeo guy you can ride me all day baby Loki's in the house

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B-Real]
See my bro and hit another plateau in the crow that I do for fun
Popo's watching all day like a show from my home just ask me for some
If ya living in the Bronx, its a shock don't pop my block cuz its a legend
Baby's on a tray Growing everyday with the lights on 24/7
Clones on hit see em in the light others fall in love with them girls
Ready take flight, better hold on tight, now we going out this world
If ya spend another dime, Try another line don't fuck with my time leave fast now!
Fucking with the doc, put it on lock, got it in stock put cash down

[Hook]
