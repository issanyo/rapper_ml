[Verse 1: Kiana Ledé]
I think it's kind of funny
You could say you love me
Turn around and play me, yeah
I think it's kind of funny
You say things you don't mean
Underestimate me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
I have always done right by you
Said you're never going to lie, liar
Shit gon' come around full cycle
I flip the script on you

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
Tell me why you mad
Tell me why you're hurt
Bet you didn't think that the tables would turn
You gon' fuck around
I'ma do the same
How you like that karma?
How you like that karma?
Yeah, that's just fairplay

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Woo, uh
I'm facing the karma, yeah
I'm guilty as hell, I pay for your nails and latest designer
The Gucci and Prada, you say I stay in the problems (you, you, you)
I stay in the nonsense
Keep coming to my house buggin' out where I stay up in Harlem
Keep thinking 'bout the trust and I hate that I lost it (breaking that trust)
I guess I'm like every rapper that came with the bullshit
Guess what goes around comes around
You keep on lastin' that karma, I come and lay you down

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
Tell me why you mad
Tell me why you're hurt
Bet you didn't think that the tables would turn
You gon' fuck around
I'ma do the same
How you like that karma?
How you like that karma?
Yeah, that's just fairplay

[Bridge: Kiana Ledé]
What goes around comes back around
Guess he wasn't ready for that fairplay
What goes around comes back around
Guess he wasn't ready for that

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
Tell me why you mad
Tell me why you're hurt
Bet you didn't think that the tables would turn
You gon' fuck around
I'ma do the same
How you like that karma?
How you like that karma?
Yeah, that's just fairplay, yeah
Yeah, that's just fairplay
