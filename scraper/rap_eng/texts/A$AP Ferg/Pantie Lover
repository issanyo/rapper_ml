[Intro]
Ah!
Thugga Thugga what up
Ferg
Talk to me nice or don't talk to me at all
Big money shit

[Hook]
Every time I walk up in the club, I got like two bitches
Every time I walk up in the club, I got my crew with me

[Verse]
Every time I see you with another nigga, you be like "damn, is he gon' love me?
I'm the nigga gettin bigger figures, don't you think I could be your hubby?
I be runnin' with a crew of bitches, don't you think they gonna fuck me?
I be runnin' with a crew of niggas, that's why they callin' us A-$-A-P
I don't give a fuck who you was fuckin'
I don't give a fuck who you was lovin', girl
Sippin' on the Henny got me buggin'
Better call a nigga back and tell me somethin', girl
I just called my partner got me trippin'
What is all this?
I'm hearin' that you trippin', girl
Now your ass need to get a whippin'
All in this bubbly, got me slippin', girl
I had you strippin'
Leave you limpin'
When my friends see you
I hope they don't see you, like that
How you go and do a nigga like that?
I fucked hoes, but a nigga right back
Fuck hoes, need to get my life back
Fuck it, need to get my life on the right track
I bought you Alexander Wang, I know you like that
With a dinner at Felice with a nice snack
Them Twitter bitches lyin', I ain't pipe that
I'm 'bout to start a pussy riot, need a light pack
Cause I come with groupie bitches, they don't like that
Tried to fuck with groupie bitches, they don't like that
All I need is you for a night cap
Beat that pussy up then I'm gonna give it an ice pack
Damn, I think a nigga picked the right track
With a tough beat with a light rap
I'm tired of givin' you niggas a nice trap
