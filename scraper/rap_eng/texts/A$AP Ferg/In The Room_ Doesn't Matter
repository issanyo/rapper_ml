[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Yeah, uh
Baby girl you're so amazing
And your body so hot like cajun
We could hit up any spot in this nation
Skinny dippin', might wanna leave your braids in
Ain't there about no groupies
Get your Prada, get your Gucci
French bulldog, new subies
Now, why you actin' boujuee?
Dippin' Dodge how I get when I'm in the Porsche
You a star, Dis your whip, take the ribbon off
Plenty bliss, wrist lit in the dark
Girl, you picked the right one 'cause we gettin' far
Never lookin' sad when you're at the bar
Never lookin' bad when you're at the bar
All these Tiffany bags, who you at the bar?
It doesn't matter, I'ma get you what you asked for

[Verse 2: Gallant]
Talking to the moon with the lights down
Half a dozen ovals in your mouth, your muse
Kurosawa bleeding through your headphones
Knuckles in my back till your nails turn blue
Bet you remember back when I was headstrong
Tugging on the ends of my invisible noose
Thought you'd be jumping ship, but I was dead wrong
You can sail on thin ice long as I can too

[Pre-Chorus: Gallant]
Uh, if this love's an accident waiting to happen
Let's go out with a bang, with a bang
Uh, I'm up to go under
To drown with each other
Yeah, we both feel the same (1, 2, 3, 4)

[Chorus: VanJess & Gallant]
Doesn't matter to us, doesn't matter to us
Doesn't matter to us, doesn't matter to us
Doesn't matter, you run, I run
You jump, I jump, that's all we want
Doesn't matter to us, doesn't matter to us
Doesn't matter to us, doesn't matter to us
Doesn't matter, you run, I run
You jump, I jump, that's all we want

[Verse 3: Gallant]
Told me two years ago I was selfish
But you're the one who put us in the mushroom cloud
Liquor bottle saying what I'm thinking
Dancing in a minefield, don't look down

[Pre-Chorus: Gallant & VanJess]
Uh, if this love's an accident waiting to happen
Let's go out with a bang, with a bang
Uh, I'm up to go under
To drown with each other
Yeah, we both feel the same

[Chorus: VanJess & Gallant]
Doesn't matter to us, doesn't matter to us
Doesn't matter to us, doesn't matter to us
Doesn't matter, you run, I run
You jump, I jump, that's all we want
Doesn't matter to us, doesn't matter to us
Doesn't matter to us, doesn't matter to us
Doesn't matter, you run, I run
You jump, I jump, that's all we want

[Bridge: VanJess & Gallant]
Stay forever young, in this state of mind
Dying for your love, call it killing time
No matter what you do I'll be on your side
Stay forever young, in this state of mind
Dying for your love, call it killing time
No matter what you do I'll be on your side

[Chorus: VanJess, A$AP Ferg & Gallant]
Doesn't matter to us, doesn't matter to us
Doesn't matter to us, doesn't matter to us
Doesn't matter, you run, I run
You jump, I jump, that's all we want
Doesn't matter to us, doesn't matter to us
Doesn't matter to us, doesn't matter to us
Doesn't matter, you run, I run
You jump, I jump, that's all we want

[Outro: VanJess]
Doesn't matter to us, doesn't matter to us
Doesn't matter to us, doesn't matter to us
