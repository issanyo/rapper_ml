[Wiz Khalifa:]
Imma need more champagne

[DJ Whoo Kid:]
NIGGA Bond

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg:]
Black James Bond, feelin' like King Kong
Wiz Khalifa with the reefer in the bong
Jet ski to the beach with a bitch in a thong
Better talk to me like you talk to your mom
Young Trap Lord, champagne in the palm
Fuck around and put your girl brain in the palm
She better give me mouth like a damn MediCom
Hit her with the bat, like Barry Bonds
Fruity baby, higher than the roof be baby
Chicks be consumin' babies
More hoes than looseleaf baby
And I'm in the new Mercedes
And the roof on the coupe be down
And your chick want champagne
Every time I come around
I work with a forty ounce
Just sippin' the Cristal
And your chick lookin' better
Now that I'm tipsy now
And she's so pissy now
I feel like R. Kelly now
I think she want my bottle
You better get your child

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I'mma need mo' champagne
Tell the waitress grab a couple more bottles
And bring em up
We got a bar for every nigga that came with us
We got some bros and bring em all
Grab a drink and get fucked up
Champagne, see them bottles of Rosé
When they think of us
We just pull up in the club to spend paper up
Whatchu hating for
Get the waitress bruh
Imma need more champagne

[Verse 2: Problem]
Pop that shit
Throwin' money in the air
Girl, drop that shit
I be beatin' pussy up
Yeah I mosh that pit
Any nigga wanna hate and I sock that bitch
Gotta hate fake niggas, we are not that shit (uh uh)
We the niggas with the dough, so knock knock bitch
Turn like a knob
Money over bullshit; we the Mob
Bustin' like a full clip lit, boutta lose it
Comin' at your girl with this Ménage
Oh yeah, I'm charged like a die
Feelin' good like a massage
