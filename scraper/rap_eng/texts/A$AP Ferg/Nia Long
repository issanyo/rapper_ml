[Intro]
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
She swing along on my ding-a
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
She swing along on my ding-a
Uh, uh, uh, oh!

[Verse 1]
Realest nigga since Biggie Smalls
Realest nigga since 2Pac
Ain't playin' with you titty boys
Gimme two chains with these two Glocks
You box on that two knock
Five shots and your crew drop
Made the lean with that ou-wap
Now you ain't coolin' your tube socks
Uncle Luke 'cause I'm too live
Them dreads hittin' your bumba Ras
Lay 'em down in that panda river
No Jamaicans dead but we 'bout to kill 'em
A$AP, my rude boys
Hoolio in that Roll-Royce
Age-butter that tube boy
This beef, no sirloin
See my bitch, she so fine
Dominican and Persian
Live, love A$AP, uh
Kiss a pig, be hurt-some

[Chorus]
She pop that ass to the third song
Pop that ass through her thong
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
She swing along on my ding-a-long
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
She swing along on my ding-a-long
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
She swing along on my ding-a-long
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
She swing along on my ding-a-long
She sippin' Crissy get too gone
Don't fuck with Henny it too strong
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
She swing along on my ding-a-long
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
She swing along on my ding-a-long
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
She swing along on my ding-a-long
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
She swing along on my ding-a-long
She sippin' Crissy get too gone
Don't fuck with Henny it too strong

[Verse 2]
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
Short head no weave on
Finger lickin', ice cream joint
Butter Pecan for the weekend
She fuckin with T Lord
'Cause I know what her knees on
Trap Lord, so rachet
I fucked the bitch mad her see-saw
Pop bitch, no sea board
Straight raw, I'ma G4
Niggas stay trickin' on a bitch and I ain't payin' no G for it
Find me in a G4
Nasty baby on P Lord
No the nigga don't like flight, but he fly high, he a G4
Free Realla, that G boy
A$AP my team strong
Pesos, now we gone
Flacko just lead on
Three mil, just him alone
Got Ferg goin' in the zone
Three mil a cars tow me home
Got Fergie all in the zone

[Chorus]
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
She swing along on my ding-a-long
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
She swing along on my ding-a-long
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
She swing along on my ding-a-long
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
She swing along on my ding-a-long
She sippin' Crissy get too gone
Don't fuck with Henny it too strong
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
She swing along on my ding-a-long
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
She swing along on my ding-a-long
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
She swing along on my ding-a-long
Pretty bitch like Nia Long
She swing along on my ding-a-long
She sippin' Crissy get too gone
Don't fuck with Henny it too strong
