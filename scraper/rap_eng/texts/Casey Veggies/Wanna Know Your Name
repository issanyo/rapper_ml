[Hook: Kent/Alexi]
I just wanna know your name (repeat)

[Verse 1: Sleezy]
Good afternoon ladies, might I say greetings
I come from outer space that’s why I seem misleading
I pledge allegiance to the blunnits that’s my team see
And it be dested in the functions how I see things
Step up in the club like ok Iont really do this
I need to loosen up
Find cream, I know we goosing
He let me hit the bottle
Now I’m feeling cool n shit
Tryna see some turnt girlies
Yea that’s prolly where June is
See so many Misses, Jam, all of em hotties
I want the one with gin and tonic in her body fluids
She looking way too naughty
Move her body so electric need to make her get on top of me
Freak her properly
Grab ya wrist and ask ya name cuz ain’t nothing stopping me
Pass on your panties and your heart the same night/that’s armed robbery

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Girls want ya boy like a child support check
I act like I love her I'm forever on set
She know I got D, and I keep it on deck
So baby girl tell me whats next?
Yea girl I can shoot it and I swear I'm all net
Go fishing in it these other niggas get all net
Started off balling now I rap I'm Artest
Girl don't come in for sex without a bullet proof vest, I get it popping
Write yo name and your number i'll put it in my pocket
Won't read it til you start walking I'mma holla at ya
She give brain yea I got a fraction
Yea she bout that action
I'm in that fendi bucket prada fashion
Try to come with me gotta ask it swagging
Got these young girls flabergasted bagging
Pulled up to her crib swervin runnin out sagging
I do my thang now im gone on to the madness

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tube]
Seen her happening on the dance floor with her, highs on
Hottest thing moving, pyro
Pussy was like moms when the street light use to shine on
Her feet nice is her mind on
Shit, she look like the type to be in the bathroom you catch my drift
But she still caught my interest got me willing to sin n shit
The way that dress slit and them tits sit in it
I'm willing to half my benefits
Damn, can I know yo name mama
Cuz you gotta chance to be in the running for main mama
Why would I lie?
I could see us being as cool as hurk
Laying in the night watching the stars form a lunar smirk
Playing in your hair while we goin through moody flirts
But you ain't know that you was layin wit a future jerk
Her boobies blocking the television but I ain't tripping
Cuz we both know im bout to make that couchie burp
Show her how to do it like guidelines
Its a process like tie dye
Baby grasp this knowledge you dont wanna let it fly by
But as of right now

[Hook]
