[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I pop up on yo' block, pull up on yo street
Girl, first I got your number, then I got under them sheets
Then I hopped on top of these beats, I ain't been home in weeks
Yeah, I know you tryna eat, but, nigga, I'm tryna feast, so I gotta go
We got hoes, we got drinks, we got all that
She gon' go, she don't think, she do all that
Wasn't feelin' lil mama, had to fall back
Hit my phone, ain't talk no dope, I don't call back
Write these verses so, player, we read verses in Isaiah
Baby ain't even gotta state it, she know that I'm a smooth operator
Baby talk too much and I don't like that
Gotta leave tomorrow and I ain't book my flight yet
Sometimes, no matter what you do, they forget about all that
But I know they gon' remember me, cause a boy all that
I'm ballin', she want it, I get it, I get it
I'm plugged in, got friends that, spend millions

[Hook x2: Casey Veggies]
We got hoes, we got drinks, we got all that
She gon' go, she don't think, she do all that
They don't think we from the streets, but I'm bout all that
I came up from the bottom, I do all that

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
All of these bitches be jockin', all of these niggas keep hatin'
I get Jacksons, Grants, and Franklins so we call that changin' faces
Stuntin' off in the Bugatti, drive so fast you think I'm racing
My nigga, this weed so strong, I'm gone, you might think I laced it
Ballin', bitch, I thought you knew
If you niggas had my paper, you'd be ballin' too
Teach a nigga how to stunt, I should start a school
All I do is press a button just to start the coupe
Swimmin' in so many women, I lost count
Once they give me that pussy, homie, I dog 'em out
If you ain't talkin' bout money then what you talkin' about?
If they say money talks, then my dollars shout
Popsicles on my chain, ice cubes on my wrist
Snow cones on my fingers, yo' bitch on my dick
Street nigga, still have a mill up in my shoe box
Old school, still keep a stash in my tube socks
Kush, all up in my rollin' papers
Got me coughin' like a cancer patient
Countin' cash like a calculator
OG still gettin' dome like activator, all that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rockie Fresh]
I fuck bitches, I get money, I do all that
Niggas want me to impress 'em, they can fall back
I'd be trippin' if I told you I was all rap
I got stocks, I got blocks, nigga, hold that
Wal-Mart prices on the roll backs
Cheap shit, nigga, we don't know that
Expensive, designer, we spendin', we spendin'
I'm ballin', got friends that's, Egyptian
And I'm out for that payback
Got a couple niggas that stay strapped, yeah
New school had a nigga trippin'
But my old bitch helped me get my soul back, yeah
I started off in a Sonata, then I went and got me a Range
Then I went and got me a Beamer
Now a few of my homies do the same
Nigga we don't care about chains, I can shine in white T
That's pro'ly why yo' bitch like me
Low key she wanna be my wifey, I'm thinkin' that she might be
Show her shit you never show her
She wanna get high, I inserted a quarter
We playin' games, you out of order
Thirsty nigga need water, you know you can't afford her, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Ty Dolla $ign]
She got blunts, I got papers, we got all that
We gon' smoke, we gon' fuck, we did all that
Homies trippin' and we trippin', we with all that
Pint of Act, double cups, we got all that
Lil bruh fought his case, just gave him all day
Baby Buddha in there too, he got all day
Time goes by, puffin' on shake
Just to keep him high, watch the time waste
L.A. niggas in Atlanta strip clubs
Smoking good, eating good, I just fell in love
Lil bitch told the homie she don't have sex
We already fucked, you ain't gotta flex

[Hook]
