[Casey Veggies speaking]
Yeah a hunned
Tryin' to get back out to the streets, you already know what it is
Out here in Miami
Bout to get to it
Yeah, all in
Yeah

[Casey Veggies]
Out in MIA, what's the play? Let's get this shit poppin'
We don't love these hoes, she tell me that's my only problem
We got options, you the type of nigga get pussy, but don't get profit
What's yo logic, she think she fuckin' with the boy but shawty stop it
I'm on my grind, its my time I'm 'bout to cop new watches
You wifin' her, but the crazy thing, she fuckin' with the posse
Got 99 problems, but your bitch is not my problem
Shout out to my Brazilian mama, shout out to my Cubaness
When she fuck with me, she gon' get higher than them rosters
I be in the hotel lobby and I'm eatin' pasta
Out in Miami bitch we 'bout to hit up [?]
I'm drinkin' up, goin' hard, ain't thinkin' much
I be on that playa shit, I'm 'bout to pop my collar
Gotta use that rubber band so my money ain't sloppy
Fans takin' pictures and them hoes I swear they watch me
But this shit ain't TV, its CV, she need me, hold up

[Christopher Walken as Frank White in "King of New York"]
From now on, nothing goes down unless I'm involved
No blackjack no dope deals, no nothing
A nickel bag gets sold in the park, I want in
You guys got fat while everybody starved on the street
Now it's my turn
