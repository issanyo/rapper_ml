[Intro]
Aw yeah yeah yeah
Check 1, 2
Like that, yeah
Aw man

[Verse]
Why do these these niggas be hating, man go get your dollars up
Bitches be wanting to follow up, I can't acknowledge her
Told me "Boy you the one, these rappers just popping up"
Got so much shit up on my mind, I feel like I'm bottled up
I gotta go get me some money, yeah go run my pockets up
At 19 counting 200 stacks but that was not enough
[?] if you not down with us then you cannot ride with us
Know you my friend in the Benz, where you was at when I would ride the bus?
Bad lil bitch she on ball alert, thought she was the one but she's out of luck
Worried bout my pockets, I got it up
Yeah my swag worth a mill, I ain't gotta stunt
I ain't worried bout these bitches, I run it up
[?] I run it up
Riding around with some powerpuffs
Got like [?] stacked in a Tonka truck
See these boys tend to get beside themself
When you was tryna get on who the hottest was
Say my name in your song, better stop it bruh
Fuck that internet beef, we popping it up
But keep your hustle [?] knock it
[?] stop it
[?] for going in pockets, nigga
Need to go get you some profit nigga
[?] stealing and robbing
I bring my niggas around the money even if they don't got it
I left my girl for a badder chick
Like baby [?]
I left the bullshit alone, I got focused like I ain't had no other options

[Chorus]
Girl I wanna float your boat
She know [?] pressing them codes
I had some highs and lows
But that's just the way that it goes
I was just staying afloat
Now I'm up doing the most
I was just [?]
Yeah but I told myself never lose hope
Girl I wanna float your boat
She know [?] pressing them codes
Yeah I'm the boy with the flows
Staying down all ten toes
I was just staying afloat
Now I'm up doing the most
I was just [?]
Yeah I was telling myself never lose hope
