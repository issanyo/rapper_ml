[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
The whip stupid, the shit wavy
My bitch bad, her ass crazy
She like girls too, hit it in my jacuzzi
She work at Jamba Juice, pay her to make a smoothie
I’m ‘bout to blend her up with Teeflii, pull off in a G-5
Yeah you know we be high, I cannot be denied
I gave her that D, now she tryna make a scene now
If she wanna fuck with me, treat me like a king now

[Chorus: Teeflii]
You doing tricks with your body right here
Everybody watching you right here
Your body doing the most
Damn right let me see your ass
Make yo money, make yo money, get yo money
It don’t matter, it don’t matter if you twerk, for it
Make yo money, make yo money, get yo money
Leave that 9 til 5 home on the shelf for me
Ain’t no stoppin’, ain’t no stoppin’ til you get it
Make yo money, make yo money, get yo money

[Vesre 2: Teefllii]
Sturn up ,Annie sturn up
You want me to reveal your cup
Bottles in the air, we acting crazy
You winding it slow, your body moving slow
You like your face down with your ass up
Legs up to the ceiling
You like your face down with your ass up
Legs up to the ceiling

[Chorus: Teeflii]
You doing tricks with your body right here
Everybody watching you right here
Your body doing the most
Damn right let me see your ass
Make yo money, make yo money, get yo money
It don’t matter, it don’t matter if you twerk, for it
Make yo money, make yo money, get yo money
Leave that 9 til 5 home on the shelf for me
Ain’t no stoppin’, ain’t no stoppin’ til you get it
Make yo money, make yo money, get yo money

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Ass stupid, face foolish
On that Wu-Tang Clan ‘cause cash rule it
In the Valley [?]
She pull up like she moving them fuckin’ units
Gad dammit, she boomin’
Two fifteens banging her music
I can see it, I salute it
We both been ballers like my jeweller

[Chorus: Teeflii]
You doing tricks with your body right here
Everybody watching you right here
Your body doing the most
Damn right let me see your ass
Make yo money, make yo money, get yo money
It don’t matter, it don’t matter if you twerk, for it
Make yo money, make yo money, get yo money
Leave that 9 til 5 home on the shelf for me
Ain’t no stoppin’, ain’t no stoppin’ til you get it
Make yo money, make yo money, get yo money
