[Verse 1: Allyn]
I told you that I'm done today
Why you keep on calling me?
And pulling up to my place?
Liking pics from weeks ago
Tryna make sure I see it
Hope you know that I don't need it
Cause I'm on a new vibe
And I really ain't got time no
You could say that I'm on a new wave
Done with you boy so get up out my way
But tell me why

[Hook: Allyn & Casey Veggies]
We go on and on x2
We go on and on, on, on
We go on and on x2
We gon on and on, yeah
We go on and on x2
We go on and on, on, on
We go on and on
We go on and on and on

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, aw man
Look
She was the one all alone
I don't know where I went wrong
I don't know what I was on
I don't know why I fronted, and can't admit I was wrong
Feeling just like Marvin shawty
Tell me what's going on witcha
That's my fault, I didn't want to rub you the wrong way
Come home to a real one girl I know you had a long day
When we foreplay it's on and on like the song say
That ass just how I like it, she pop it just like the ros√©
The homerun after the foreplay
Said you ain't been home a lot
Like could you be here more bae
I been on some other shit
No sleep in like four days
Funny how either way
You still gone get your way
Damn

[Hook: Allyn & Casey Veggies]
Tell me why

We go on and on, on, on
We go on and on x2
We gon on and on, yeah
We go on and on x2
We go on and on, on, on
We go on and on
We go on and on and on

[Verse 3: Allyn]
When I'm all alone
Thinking bout what we did wrong
Boy can you tell me what is going on
Just cause you love me that don't mean that we gotta be together
I can't keep going on and on with you baby not like this forever, forever

[Outro: Allyn & Casey Veggies on the phone]
