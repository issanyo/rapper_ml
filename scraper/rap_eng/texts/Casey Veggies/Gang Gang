[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
I'm rollin' up that motivation, they don't ever give me no credit
No alerts turned on my phone so I ain't get your message
These women all in they feelings over call-backs and all that
Man, tell these hoes that I'm big time and I'm Mannie Fresh, how you love that?
That bank card like uh, rich nigga, no limit
Top off when it pop off, with her head down, how I'm livin'?
Bitch, stay out your feelings, keep it G and get rich
She came over, that's game over, she here talkin' with Richard
I told lite(?) that it's go time, if she 'bout that then it's lit
Cap' just called me on FaceTime while smokin' joints with your bitch
And that's G-A-N-G, gotta say it two times
Twenty cents on me, in the party, I got two dimes, for sure

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
All these hoes in my phone
They be out to get me, swear I ain't really doin' nothing wrong
I been goin' so damn hard and I ain't seen it in so long
My legs tired from runnin' game but I thank God, I'm strong
Every day I gotta fight cause I'm puttin' on for my fam
Hundred mill all in my will was always in the plan
Hell yeah, that come with it, I sacrifice for the game
Baby girl, she layed up, I'm countin' dough with my gang
Wizzle man stay gettin' high, Young Veggies doin' the same thing
I ain't sayin' no names, all I know is go bang
All these hoes is insane but all my bitches go ham
Fit them girls in the van, Young Veggies the man
For like ten years, I'm still ridin' round with my

If it's money then we talk it, if it's not, you need to stop it
Got a girl but I need options, you like one, take your pick
Love some black girls but this white one lookin' thick

Khalifa Man, take your bitch
One rule, make me rich
