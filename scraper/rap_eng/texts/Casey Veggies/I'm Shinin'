Step through the door, girls on the floor

And I'm tryna get you
And you tryna get me
And they call me Casey

Oh, and they know I'm shining
Ain't got signed yet, ain't got no diamonds
Why them fools [?]
All my new shit got the haters crying
You ain't better than me, stop lying
If you can't get hyphy, niggas start trying
But I got on man, I'm bout to start flying

She know what's happening and the girls is laughing
And my money is stacking

Saw the money and now I want dough
They all watching me, first place still clocking me

Ten girls, got my tenth crown
They like "Oh, tight pants are in now?"
Ohh, I think they like me

Up and down and shake they head, shake they head
Five dollars and now they breaking bread
Club famous without trying
