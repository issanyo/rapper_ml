[Verse One: Alex Fitts of The Kickdrums]
So long, I've been wasting time away
And I'm feeling lost and found, you know that's okay with me
Oh I wish I was an angel but I lost my pair of wings
I slip away, so long, hello, hello, slip away
So long, I lay wasted in a dream
And I wish I'd wake up, but that won't do much for me
Oh I wish I was an eagle but I lost my pair of wings
I slip away, so long, hello, hello

[Hook: Alex Fitts]
She's got a list of complications in her eyes
Just set it free, won't you let it go?
He's got a list of burning questions on his mind
If you let it free, you could let it go, high

[Verse Two: Casey Veggies]
Ah man, game over, total abomination, congratulations
Made it to the payment, through all the ups and downs in the rough pavement
And all the beautiful girls thought they was infiltrating
You feel alone? I got it on my own, I'm popping in my zone
Told your ma to hit my phone, not right now, till she got me turnt on
That was a little later, I'm private, an instigator
Life switched and it changed, ain't no time for waiting
So my time right now, that's my proclamation, despite that
I'm willing to fight back, this something I'm dedicated
I'm thinking it might stack, nothing feels better than a brand new morning
Swear last night, everybody was going in, this flow, I own it
Consider it right for it and in her mind, I shine, hit it hard then the lights glow
