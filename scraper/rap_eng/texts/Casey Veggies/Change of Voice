[Intro]
Yeah, niggas want the real right?
So I guess I'ma... that's what I'm gonna do

[Hook]
I gotta be me, I have no choice
I gotta be me, I have no choice
I gotta be me, I have no choice
Yeah, yeah, I have no choice
I gotta be me, I have no choice
These niggas want me to change my voice
I gotta be me, I have no choice
Yeah, yeah, I have no choice

[Verse 1]
CAC, that's been me since birth
Before I rocked these streetwear shirts
Before I hit 'em where it hurts
I got to be the best [?] on Earth
If they gon' sign me, how much am I worth?
But watch, I'ma prove to you niggas
That I am too cool for you niggas
The worst thing about this living
That everybody ain't about their business
This what I'm destined to be
But Jay-Z would sign his nephew instead of me, you feel me
But I can only get stronger off of what doesn't kill me
I have no choice, man

[Interlude]
Niggas, nigga man
These niggas not ready

[Hook]
I gotta be me, I have no choice
I gotta be me, I have no choice
I gotta be me, I have no choice
Yeah, yeah, I have no choice
I gotta be me, I have no choice
These niggas want me to change my voice
I gotta be me, I have no choice
Yeah, yeah, I have no choice

[Verse 2]
You niggas don't know squat like I'm sitting down
The same left hook, just a different round
The same round but a different gun
The same mom but a different son
The odds are none to one
But watch me beat them
These beats looking real good, watch me eat them
I know what I need to do, my steps ain't sequenced
If I stand there with a glare, y'all can't see in
Why y'all don't believe it? I'm tryna find myself
And as I get older, I'ma find my wealth
You can't tell I'm chosen? That car hit me
My heart was icebox frozen
Y'all sleep, y'all still dozing

[Interlude 2]
Man hold up man, hold up
Niggas need to listen to the lyrics, man
It's like, like, like

[Hook]
I gotta be me, I have no choice
I gotta be me, I have no choice
I gotta be me, I have no choice
Yeah, yeah, I have no choice
I gotta be me, I have no choice
These niggas want me to change my voice
I gotta be me, I have no choice
Yeah, yeah, I have no choice

[Verse 3]
Allow me to reintroduce myself
But y'all should already know my name
It's a regular, the flow not sane
Play my songs after theirs, it won't be the same
After the fame, I will never ever change
And this here is not a game, y'all scrimmaging
And yeah Casey get love from the women friends
Thanks for filling him
If if shoes ain't there, there's no filling him
My soul protected, there's no killing him

[Outro]
Here we are man, yo
Shout out Three-One-Oh for the beat, man
(They just want me to change my voice)
Casey Veggies, man
That's the name
