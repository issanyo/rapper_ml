[Verse 1]
I be early in the morning
Waking up tryna get on
It's my time to get it
Next up in my city, put on for me home
I know that she with it, she bout her business
She fell in love, got hooked on my drug
And I stay committed
But my mind on the bank
Gotta make sure I got racks in my bank
My big cousin do not fuck with the bank
Wondering why, what the fuck do you think?
The fuck do you think?
I'm like what are you on?
Don't mess with the boy, don't fuck with the vibe
And don't kill my zone
And it's all about patience
Shawty stay down so we with the Jamaicans
Stay on my grind and I make it to up
I deserve my spot, I'm one of the greatest
Pop all them bottles we celebrated
Young ass nigga see hella faces
Whole clique straight the money got braces
Gave her a shot but I can not chase it

[Hook]
I gotta get it, I put on for my city
I thank God that I did it, I kept that shit coming
Yeah, I stay committed
The people want more and I gotta get on
Put my life in these songs and do something different
I stay committed, yeah I stay committed
I stay committed, yeah I stay committed
Yeah I'm never quitting
I stay committed, yeah I stay committed
Yeah I stay committed, yeah I stay committed
Yeah I'm never quitting it

[Verse 2]
When she in the city she roll with the boy
She fuck with the boy
She don't know nobody she would rather be with
I'm connected like Mitee
To the guap where we getting it
Turn that 5 to a 10 and that 10 to a 50
Yeah I stay committed
I'm part of the matrix
She changing faces
She don't really wanna go
But I know she can not stay here
The shit in my mind, no I can't erase it
Brodie catch shit caught cases
Got keys to the city I feel like the mayor
And it's all about patience
Shawty stayed down so I copped her them bracelets
Stay on my grind and I make it to up
I deserve my spot, I'm one of the greatest
Pop all them bottles we celebrated
Young ass nigga see hella faces
Whole clique straight the money got braces
Gave her a shot but I can not chase her

[Hook]
I gotta get it, I put on for my city
I thank God that I did it, I kept that shit coming
Yeah, I stay committed
The people want more and I gotta get on
Put my life in these songs and do something different
I stay committed, yeah I stay committed
I stay committed, yeah I stay committed
Yeah I'm never quitting
I stay committed, yeah I stay committed
Yeah I stay committed, yeah I stay committed
Yeah I'm never quitting it

[Outro]
I stay committed, yeah I stay committed
I stay committed, yeah I stay committed
Yeah I'm never quitting
I stay committed, yeah I stay committed
Yeah I stay committed, yeah I stay committed
Yeah I'm never quitting

I stay committed I stay committed
I stay committed (yeah I'm never quitting)
I stay committed I stay committed
I stay committed I stay committed
(yeah I'm never quitting)
