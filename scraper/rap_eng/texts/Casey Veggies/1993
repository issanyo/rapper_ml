[Intro]
Yeah, feel it
Just gotta feel it
Yo, here we go
Check

[Verse 1]
It's the new west coast, best flow
The city where them niggas want you to give up and let go
But no, it won't go down
That's why they show love every time I come around
I'm young, do it all for my god damn self
And I made it this far, I don't need y'all help
Let's go to the sky where God keep you alive
Live life to the fullest cause everybody dies
It's real, they popping guns like pills
All we tryna stay fresh and spit rhymes ill, ill
I told you do it different
Cause I ain't tryna live life when she getting it

[Hook]
She wanna know what it feel like
[?]
We in love and it feel right
We gon' be grinding all night, night
She wanna know what it feel like
[?]
We in love and it feel right
We gon' be grinding all night

[Verse 2]
And my mom say "Work hard in school"
And I told her I'm trying but them teachers think I'm a fool
Like what the hell am I supposed to do
Be me momma and I'ma be you
You gon' see what I see and everything that I do
I'm living, tryna take it to the top
That's why they gon' cop whenever the boy drop
I'm hot like L.A. weather in the summer time
My girl gave me the track so I'm running mine
And I'm Jackie [?] on the takeoff
Flow like Saw 3, take a nigga face off
Hey y'all tell me when I'm gon' get paid
Cut all be short like 8 balls
Shout out Pat [?]
[?] better homie you get laid off
And I don't know what to say dog, I'm chilling
I'm shaded, they feel it, higher than the ceiling
There ain't no coming back when the boy kill it
I'm really that dude, I'm really that fly
They looking through the tints when they see me riding by
[?] I never lie to ya
I know I'm that guy to ya
I won't cry to ya
But I do cry to myself tryna find this heaven in hell
But do I do it for the fame
Cause I just want niggas to know my name it's a shame
Trapped in the game, logged on like AIM
But really nigga what is my aim? I don't know
You and [?] hit me up, said it's time to rock the show
The crowd like swag, I'ma blow, let's go
And she asks what's gon' happen to her when the fame come
I said girl, that ain't gon' change nothing
But how really would I know
Why am I so attached every time she wanna go
It's almost like I can't let go
Let me know man, God told me I'm my own man
Time fly, I'm getting grown man
My mom's like "Casey, watch your tone, man"
I said "Sorry I was spazzing out"
[?] I'm running my mouth
So if I haven't figured out, you don't know what I'm about
You'll prolly never figure out

[Hook]
She wanna know what it feel like
[?]
We in love and it feel right
We gon' be grinding all night, night
She wanna know what it feel like
[?]
We in love and it feel right
We gon' be grinding all night

[Outro]
I was born in 1993, you feel me
