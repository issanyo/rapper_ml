[Verse 1: Demrick]
We pouring shots to celebrate the new gear, only the crew here
Met a lot of people last year and I had to leave a few there
Mama told me choose my friends wisely
Spoken good, I been high, look at these tracks I been bodied
And it started at the party, she want everybody
I ain't even gon' front though cause she got body
And if she catch me at the right time, she might get bodied
You know how it goes sometimes
And I always keep a couple rolled, so we gon' blow one time
My attitude is anything is possible if you try
Just hustle wise, watch your money multiply to the sky
I had to switch my number up, too much bullshit on my line
I'm having trouble leaving my trouble past behind
I put the truth in my song cause it's a pastor's time
And when people get to hear it, then it amplifies
I won't let this moment pass me by
I'm gon' go for mine

[Hook: Demrick]
I'mma let 'em keep 'em on doubting cause they don't know shit about me
I roll one up then I'm outtie, yeah yeah
I keep my mind plotting and I love my parties rowdy
Keep a couple bad ones round me, yeah yeah
Different day, same shit
Different day, same shit
Different day, same shit
Different day, same shit

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Looked in the mirror and told myself that I can get it
I'm the illest, it's a fuck if you ain't rocking with it
I whip and put it in pot, without a pot to piss in
Lakes in the grass, always fucking up the vision
Need 1500 or nothing, these other niggas fronting
Even if she talking shit, I can tell she want it
I'm on top of my hustle, she get on top of something
Don't talk about it, I'm'bout it, I get it, got it, done it all
Man, real niggas back now
I'm that same flashy kid playing the background, I can't complain
He young getting some ass now, tryna be my main
I don't stress it, I'm somewhere probably just on a plane
Yeah, they can tell that we not the same
She fuck with me cause I'm a young winner, feel the game
I need it all, the top where I aim
Keep a couple bad ones round me 'til they feelings change

[Hook: Demrick]
I'mma let 'em keep 'em on doubting cause they don't know shit about me
I roll one up then I'm outtie, yeah yeah
I keep my mind plotting and I love my parties rowdy
Keep a couple bad ones round me, yeah yeah
Different day, same shit
Different day, same shit
Different day, same shit
Different day, same shit

[Bridge: Demrick]
You know I already got a lot to say but I don't really give a fuck
I'm just doing me and all my fans gon' give it up, so give it up
And fuck how they feel, you know we willing to die for this
We gonna ride and that's real

[Hook: Demrick]
I'mma let 'em keep 'em on doubting cause they don't know shit about me
I roll one up then I'm outtie, yeah yeah
I keep my mind plotting and I love my parties rowdy
Keep a couple bad ones round me, yeah yeah
Different day, same shit
Different day, same shit
Different day, same shit
Different day, same shit
