[Intro: Casey Veggies]
Casey Veggies, Ace The Creator

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I'm telling myself, I should go mystery C
But these niggas don't want the mystery me
Why I rap? What to defend me?
I'm like man this music shit is in me
"Yo, Casey what you doing?" Dreamchasin'
And I thank everybody that gives me motivation
If life is sneakers, guess my mind is laced in
They call me Casey Veggies man y'all can't taste him
Y'all didn't like him, but y'all wanna date him
Nigga he's too real, y'all can't fake him
Close your eyes and realize what you're gonna do to get by
Casey What you doing? I just gotta get by
So in this, I put my heart and soul
Put the pen to the paper then your heart unfolds
Open your ears, we're trynna get to you
And the Creator trynna get it too

[Verse 2: Tyler The Creator]
Base drum, High hat, intercourse with the melody
They're sailing by 4 words "Fuck You, Pay Me"
That's 4 syllables, the 3rd one is killing you
I'm half retarded so my thinking process instrumental
Yeah, look
I'm skate mental, schizophrenic, go get him
Thoughts is more raw than Supreme denim
Cause look, If fall legends die, here? I'm trynna have fun
All legends die, when I fuck my day's gonna come?
Probably next week, couple years
Dogg crip walking with a green sky the president prolly queer
Not trynna psych you, but niggas on myspace asking for beats
Get the point, I do not like you
I'm a beast with the beat but I will not hype you
Customized Greatly, don't believe? I'll pipe you
And yeah all of that while my nigga Casey Veggies was

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Started off at 12 but now I'm grounded
Heard the rhymes in the age, now they so astounded
Got phone calls home so now he grounded
My mind, my soul you can't defeat us
That's like trynna ollie without sliding your feet up
So here's the mixtape, the music re-up
Guns in his rap so he's tuff
I got a lot of verses but I don't write enough
Cause you gotta lift weights to be buff
Just shock me, y'all can't stop me
Talking to these girls man, my mind was rocky
Niggas going from Levis to Versaces
Alright though, yeah we outty
