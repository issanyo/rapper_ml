[Intro:]
We the plug
It's that new shit for the summer
Let's go
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the boy

[Hook x2:]
These girls love the boy, love the boy
These girls love the boy
These girls love the boy, they love the boy
These girls love the boy

[Verse 1:]
I come with a plan
Japanese pants, stacking bands on bands
Young nigga but I do more
Do it like this, they just can't ignore
Girls call me the boy
I been winnin', but I need a lot more
If you was in my position, wouldn't know what to do
All that shit you gotta endure
She Roll wit me cause I'm gettin it
If it wasn't rap, it would be the same story

[Hook x2:]

[Verse 2:]
These girls love the boy, these girls know she gone go for sure
We be out on tour, spittin' that flow, gettin' that dough for sure
I ain't even with all that talkin', I just want the dome
Nigga we go hard,girl tell your squad come out to the show
Shawty, what's the deal? What's the plot? I'mma be up in the spot
I'mma pull up in a 'Rari, up in the party, shirt off when it get hot
She gone choose up, it's her thing
What you think all these girls on the planet for?
Really ain't got no game
It's that all these girls understand my story

[Hook x2:]

[Verse 3:]
These girls love the boy
She a Goer, and the drinks is poured up
Never been to college, if I did, I would be a sophomore
She gone go home sore, beat it up, had it on the floor
They gone wife you up, I'mma show you a real nigga to the core
These girls love the boy and I'm about to be a man now
My heart is forsure, baby, I ain't with all that playin up
These girls love the boy and I love 'em too
They fuckin' with the boy and I'm fuckin' with 'em too

[Hook x2:]

[Outro:]
Yea, young nigga movement
I'm on Pluto, it's the boy
Holla your boy
These girls love the boy, these girls love the boy
These girls love the boy, these girls love the boy
These girls love the boy, these girls love the boy
These girls love the boy, these girls love the boy
