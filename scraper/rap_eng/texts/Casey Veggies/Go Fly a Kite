[Hook: brandUn DeShay (sample)]
I wanna be the best that I can be (we are kites in the sky, we can fly)
Right, right, right, right? (we can fly, we can fly, we can fly)
With God on my side, there's nothing that I can't see (we are kites in the sky, we can fly)
Right, right, right, right? (we can fly, we can fly, we can fly)
It was promised to me there's nothing that I can't be (we are kites in the sky, we can fly)
Right, right, right, right? (we can fly, we can fly, we can fly)
So until I become the best, baby, I can't flee (we are kites in the sky, we can fly)
Nah, uh-uh, nah, uh (we can fly, we can fly, we can fly)

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
I told everybody don't doubt me
Now anybody still sleeping on me gonna have nightmares about me
They told me I'm no Jada, they said I wouldn't make it
I told them my flow was medicine, said they wouldn't take it
I gave them the cold flow and still they wasn't shaking
Niggas had hooded coats, I knew that they was faking
A bunch of Clay Aikens
But I got my kite in the sky, flying high like the new Ben Franklin
But, I'm frankly yours
I'm the moon and the sky if you try to shoot for
Like... ready, aim, fire
Bang, dang, every dream is assembly required
But I got a mind like [?], uh
If I build it then they will come, my day will come
Cause I can see colors in my music
I hope you see color when I use it

It was promised to me that there was nothing I can't be (we are kites in the sky, we can fly)
Right, right, right, right? (we can fly, we can fly, we can fly)
So until I become the best, I guess I can't leave (we are kites in the sky, we can fly)
Nah, nah, nah, nah (we can fly, we can fly, we can fly)

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
My future bright while you haters flying kites
I'm stomping in my Nikes
With my shades on
Fresh from the start until the day gone
Veggies just welcome haters back like that Mase song
I'm living in a fantasy, just flying off the canopy
Taking everything because there's nothing that they handed me
I'm ill, I feel what's real
And it's a cold life, just chill
Just freeze, just think
Things happen in half-seconds, so don't blink
We tagging the world up, we need mo' green
Mo' ink, mo' bars, mo' shows, mo' cars
Louie hanging, oh God, more haters, more "nah"s
More songs, good job, man we so odd
I pray that I live, homie, my faith in God
A few kisses at the bottom and more dates on the top
The more they hear my music and the more they on my jock
And time is money and it cost more than a watch, like
