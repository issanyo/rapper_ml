[Intro]

[Hook: Niko G4]
These hoes lies like niggas, these niggas switch like hoes
I just keep to myself, winning is my [?]
These hoes thirsty like niggas, these niggas be bitchin' like hoes
Talking down to their homies, niggas lyin' to their bros
Heard you doing dirt, damn I'm like for sure
Talkin' to myself, fuck I can't trust a soul
I trust a bitch nah, I can't trust a hoe
Hoes be doing anything, fuckin' for the dough

[Verse 1: Niko G4]
These hoes wanna lie, I ain't really got no time
I ain't really got no type, real girls only thing I like
Keep shit G and make sure that pussy stay tight
Gotta keep a small circle, smoking on gas, no purple
Niggas wanna shine but do no working
Hoes want money, gotta do a lot of twerking
And they do it on the 'gram but never in person
These niggas wanna call you fam, same nigga that stealing bands
Lame niggas tryna steal the brand cause they see I got fans
And that's some hoe shit that I never understand
My city raised a G, my momma raised a man

[Hook: Niko G4]

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
These hoes lie like niggas, these niggas bitchin' like hoes
Young G straight out the 'wood, where I'm from anything goes
Do she love me and my figures, she backstage at my show
She heard about Young Veggies yeah, she said she fuck with G4
I'm faded off that drink, Beamer hittin' that roll
Yeah I don't fuck with these niggas and I'm switching up these hoes
She know I'm that nigga, it don't get no bigger
I'm riding round with my killers cause I don't trust these niggas man
[?], these hoes roll with the winners
I stay down when I come around and it's never ever nothin' different
She fell in love with my game, she feeling on my Range
She seen a young boy shining hard, yeah everything bling-bling
[?] trippin' to South Beach and [?]
Fuck a regular plane, we copping a jet and we heading to France
Five hundred stacks, [?] see my eyes light up when I got my advance
The game is so fucked up, these niggas is acting like hoes, be a man
