[Intro]
Straight up out the 'wood, uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I said straight up out the 'wood, man I'm fresh off the block
At 19 I pulled that Audi Coop fresh off the lot
I'm bout to hop up in that foreign and put the west on the map
Doing a show out of town with LA on my hat
I'm from where it goes down, you gotta watch where you at
Or what you wear, your colors cause they don't care
I spit that hope all of them others can stay aware
Cause your son is outside and the war is always near
Every morning I left the house my momma would say a prayer
And hoping I get that call that would force her to shed a tear
See the way that you moving, you doing it out of fear
They fucked you over the fame, I told you the game ain't fair
She whispering in my ear she don't want no type of player
Told her baby I'm rare and I don't think you prepared
Big mula and I got my ten inches yeah
I'm talking money and the power, put it on your head

[Hook]
Damn lil mama you done grew up
She told me that her other dudes suck
Well why you fuckin' with them losers
She scared of love all the time, I told her choose up
I'm like damn lil mama you done grew up
She told me that her other dudes suck
Well why you fuckin' with them losers
She scared of love all the time, I told her choose up

[Verse 2]
I'm like "What's up?" she like "What's up?"
I kept it real with her, said I give no fucks
She on the same page, I guess it's my luck
Girl what's your address, I play your block up
Back in high school I was best dressed on 'em
I rocked that LV, I had to flex on 'em
In that mattress told her I do magic
She a goddess, girl you the baddest
You was Jasmine, I was Aladdin
We had passion mixed with the fashion
I can't stack up the money if I can't add it
Put the whole team on my back and I'm still swaggin'
Yeah homie that's something you can't fathom
My chick ass fat, you can look but you can't grasp it
A lot of girls in the club but I'ma pass it
Ten years strong in the game, I'm still smashin'

[Hook]
Damn lil mama you done grew up
She told me that her other dudes suck
Well why you fuckin' with them losers
She scared of love all the time, I told her choose up
I'm like damn lil mama you done grew up
She told me that her other dudes suck
Well why you fuckin' with them losers
She scared of love all the time, I told her choose up

[Outro]
Choose up or lose up
2016 and beyond
Ya dig, yeah
They thought I was done
Hell nah nigga, hell nah
