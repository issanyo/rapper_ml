[Intro]
What’s your story?
Where did you come from?
Where you get that from? You know what I’m sayin’?
Young winners, big dreams
Let’s go

[Verse 1]
I’m poppin’, we on
She playin’ my songs
I prefer to just get the dome
Or the backside ‘cause I like that position
Real young boy with a king intuition
Hard like a nigga in prison
??
Ride through the city with a sassy young thing and she part of the committee
Girl let’s get down to the nitty gritty
If you ain’t wanna flirt then cover your titties
Says she wanna boss, want someone like Diddy
Ain’t making a band
Just made a hundred grand
Young winners we got it, man you born not needy just like me
Baby so cold, baby so cold
Make me wanna tap her on the shoulder, tell her let’s roll
To a place where we know we can go
Remember when they didn’t even know we can flow?
I’m the freshest young kid, most popular
Catch me in the city, I’m popping up
Ain’t no such thing as a pop of blow
‘Cause you still gon’ forget what you used to know
I’m putting on, I’m opening doors
I’m loving my high, touching my lows
Girl where you wanna get dropped off?
We can drive this time with the top off
How ‘bout this time I get topped off?
Excuse my language, that’s just Spanglish
We just had a boy talk ‘cause he famous
Getting to wild, gotta tame it
Saw a strange sight, I should frame it
Just to let you know, we ain’t on the same shit

[Hook]
I’m poppin’, we on
She playin’ my songs
I’m rightin’ my wrongs
It took me so long
I came a far way and I did everything my way
That’s progress, my options
That took time to process
(Young winners, we got it
Young winners, we got it, man) (x4)

[Verse 2]
If you don’t compromise then you gon’ strike
Are you ride or die?
Please don’t lie
See on to the next with it, didn’t realize that she had the best with her
S on my chest, I’m Superman
Flying through the hood
Told the homie what’s good
Thought you need a lil' bit of inspiration
So I told myself I might as well should
Said I might as well should
Yeah, I might as well should
I’m that dude
I wear my heart like a tattoo
My life is art
My nights are long and my rights are strong
Gotta live a little to write this song
Gotta focus to be what I’m on
Gotta booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Young winners, we got it
Shaded off in the tropics
Talk to the people like a prophet
Hope my youngins ain’t misguided
Make sure you the flyest
And work on your timing
Don’t be mad you ain’t shinin’
You can spend that time grindin'
Ask about him in the streets
They gon’ say a beast
Catch her right place, right time, she gon’ freak
We squaded up like we gon’ eat
Kept the same thought like you gon’ see
She yelling out that so CV
With a lot more money than my last CD
Lot of people thought that they had me beat
Til they turned this song as an MP3, like

[Hook]
