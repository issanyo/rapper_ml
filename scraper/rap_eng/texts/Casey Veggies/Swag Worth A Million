[Intro - Casey Veggies]
Yeah, Swag worth a million

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Rain flooded threw on my frames cause my name stuntin'
It's all gon' change cause my name coming
So fitted young niggas with mo vision
I did it all its no rush
I like chicks in low chucks that like to dance, toe touch
She love school and love to suck
Never met a girl that I could trust, except my mom and my main chick
They ride or die see it eye to eye even if a Nigga wasn't famous
I grew up with some wild shit, thank god my father could tame me
Or I prolly could've been a games b, But ain't none of you Niggas gon' change me
I'm the same G Young Casey not easily influenced, by my friends
Same ones that brush me off gone be the same ones tryna ride the Benz
Three months thats on tour with Mac Meezy and his White Fans
Pulled off in them groupie hoes they chasing us tryna to caravan
My flow carrion Burberry cologne she call my phone I'm in the zone
Trying to think to young to drink but if we going I'm copping Patron
The homie said he got a clothing line, told him send me that I'll rock it fasho
I'll swag you out I'm beneficial Underground and Providential
Past full of broken dreams I finally found some shit official
Momma said she proud of me can't wait to get her everything she wishing
Ride it slow, Ride it slow cause if I don't I could probably crash
At 13 used to rap my dreams, at 18 got a pocket of cash
Weight of the world, the weight of the world
Can't wait no more I'm taking the world
Praying to God and keeping it thorough and oh man I'm hoping it works
Like hoping it works said I'm hoping it works
I'm praying to God and keeping it thorough and oh man I'm hoping it works
