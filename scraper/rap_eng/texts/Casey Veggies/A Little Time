[Hook]
You ask me what I'm been on
I promise I been on my grind
Searching for something in this world
A lot of things on my mind
Just hold on girl
I promise that I just need some time
I need a moment to myself
So just give me a little time

[Verse 1]
Yeah, like Usher girl I got it bad
Girl I'm your nigga, best you ever had
I beat it up until that pussy mad
I made it mine, she had to tell her dad
And then he asked me like what's up with that
And then you let him know you can't get enough of that
I'm the man and she into men
Like the bitches on the gram, bitches on the gram
Yeah, if she don't see me, she gon' hear me though
She know I ain't no fake rapper like CB4
Man where the girls that's ready to go
She went full throttle cause I'm on the go
MC Hammer, they can't touch this flow
Yeah that's my chick, you can look but you can't touch it though
They looking confused, you have to let 'em know
It's me and my bitch and that's just how it go

[Verse 2]
Try to take my chick, then I might take your chick
I'm young and rich, man I just take my pick
Yeah, she taking pictures, send it to my phone
And when I'm gone, she said she feel alone
I'm getting grown, I'm tryna buy a home
Girl we can get it all, location unknown
When we get together, it's a different zone
We upgrade each other like Beyonce's song
Girl I ain't thirsty for any of these R&B singers
But I respect your mind and I love your demeanor
When you spending bands, you'll get paid to love
I'm talking sex in the shower, candles in the tub
I pull up on you in a brand new car
Bonnie & Clyde, we against the law
We should start over just because
Meet again and then fall in love
Act like we didn't know each other
Give me your number and then we fuck
Don't trip, I ain't judging you girl
Yeah you know all we need is trust, yeah
