[Hook]
You need a spliff then it’s on me mane
I don’t really think you want these problems
I get off and I get off
Then I'ma get on, then I'm get on
I get off and I get off
Then I'ma get on, then I'm get on
I get off and I get off
Then I'ma get on, then I'm get on

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I close my eyes, I was waiting for this
I'm just looking in the mirror while they taking their pics
I just take it and pick, give it back when I'm done with
The chance come man I run with it, yeah
My shoes laced up, tryna get my cake up
These [?] when I make up, say somethin'
No reply and know he fly
So that guy just look me in the eyes, eye
The clear frames got me all up in the game
[?] worry about making a name, it's a shame, yeah
Chuck told me just stay up in my lane, no restrain
The Game told me this shit is insane
So I'm looking so I don't change
And swerving in my brain crashing all the lames
[?] when the boy [?]
All up in their eyes with it, [?]

[Hook: Rich Hil & Casey Veggies]
You need a spliff then it's on me mane
I don't really think you want these problems
I get off and I get off
Then I'ma get on, then I'm get on
I get off and I get off
Then I'ma get on, then I'm get on
I get off and I get off
Then I'ma get on, then I'm get on


[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
The sunshine come and leave quicker than a snap on picture
So girl you the issue
So that is why flip her on to the next page
I feel the rage when I get caged in to the corner
And yeah you say I'm on ya but i'm just tryna warn ya
Or maybe I should leave you in the morning
So yeah I'm just moaning while you sad and crying
A sad day would be if you was fake and lying
So I lie right now, my eyes right down
Everything I see, am I live right now
I smile like frowns, never lose my sound
Look at what I found, it couldn't have happened better
You not about the beef, why you acting so fed up, like Federline
She ate it up when I fed her lines
She wait for the better time so I gave her mine
I'm in her mind like all the time

[Hook: Rich Hil & Casey Veggies]
You need a spliff then it's on me mane
I don't really think you want these problems
I get off and I get off
Then I'ma get on, then I'm get on
I get off and I get off
Then I'ma get on, then I'm get on
I get off and I get off
Then I'ma get on, then I'm get on

[Outro: Casey Veggies]
Look up in the sky, tell me what you see
It's a young boy flying, they call him CV
Beats for clothes when I make it
Homie, go and tell a friend
And we leave when the story begin, the end
