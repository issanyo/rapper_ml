[Verse 1: Casey Veggies and Niko G4]

[Casey Veggies]
Brand new prada shoes with the Louis belt
Used to rock the Stussy tee, now im in that PNC
Free that nigga Boosie B and keep around like 2 or 3
Darcey was too old for me, now she rollin' with Young CV

[Niko G4]
G4, that Prada sign, what we on
Maison Martin Margiela the kinda shit my bitch on
We so young But too grown
My temper short, My money long
Up in Vegas with a bad white bitch, Celine Dion

[Casey Veggies]
I go hard, no flaws
Young LA nigga with a lot of heart
Im coming in with them backshots
Girl I beat that shit up from the start
No games, im getting paid
Them boys gassed up off propane
Passed it to the Brohams, and told my niggas go ham

[Niko G4]
Go ham I kill this shit, Bet all these hoes feeling it
Veggies and that nigga G4, oh that shit is too legit
Five stacks spent for the Gucci
Seven spent up in Louis
Add that up, now im leaving home with your groupies
You niggas weak, fucked your bitch, only took a week
Back shots till a nigga skeet
She know she just my lil freak
Private planes and gold rangs
Young ass nigga doing boss thangs
Fly down to my shoe strings, she suck me with that tounge ring

[Hook: Casey and Niko]
One hand up on the ass, One hand up on the cash
Young niggas we move fast, Yo bitch she chose too fast
Pick her up, take her down, got the weed I break it down

Sometimes think to myself, like girl you crazy you know you frontin'!
Whole fit cost 2 stacks, Polo to my tube socks
My last album was too hot, yo girl like it dont be shocked
When im in her home, getting dome
By the time you get there im switching zones
Outta here probably on the phone
She told me she want it for long?
You handcuff, and I release, my closet is BC
She eat me, I eat beats, like Ripley's you ain't gotta believe
