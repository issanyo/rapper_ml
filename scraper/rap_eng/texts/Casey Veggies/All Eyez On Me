I'm interested in who you are, not what you're not
When we hit the grove you know I love to go and shop
It's in the bag man I'm finna cop
I left a note up on the counter, gotta get the guap
I'm riding 'round windows tinted cause the city hot
I really run the town, pay the rent a lot
I'm sipping Hennessy like 2Pac
All eyez on me bitch yeah I'm the reason why the crew hot
That type of shit y'all rapping 'bout in these rap songs get you shot
He run around with the wrong crowd, try to find his way to a new spot
I got that game girl, I might get your friend
Just being honest, put y'all together and get it in
I wake up every morning knowing I'ma get the win
I had a vision, I stayed with it, stuck to the plan
They got this shit on playback
I should've been on that XXL Freshmen cover like way back
Life Changes a classic, yeah nigga I stay fat
They slept on me, I'm somewhere first class just laid back
She wanna be my new thing
I told the girl I came from the Playaz Circle like 2 Chainz
New name is CV, think she got it all but she need me
She down to roll, I'm on the bike, she in the basket like E.T
I'm the one like Keanu Reeves
Boat full of hoes like Kyrie
It's something about a real nigga
I love when girls get on their knees

Back in 8th grade yeah middle school when I was just that little dude
Hate a nigga you ridicule, I'm really tired of interviews
Gettin' dough, I salute you though
Real shit I fuck with it
All my niggas is self-made
If you dick riding I don't fuck with you
I can't rock with you, I got no love for you
Your girl notice it too, I feel bad for you
I'll stop right now if I'm lying
I'm so west side, baby [?] rider

You and me didn't really plan on it
You just came through, you know I had to put my hands on it
Damn shorty, yeah shorty, god damn shorty

Whole fit cost like five bands on it
We was together but you switch up like a Transformer
