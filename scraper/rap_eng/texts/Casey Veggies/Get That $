[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Came back to the city, everything poppin'
Same girl waitin' for me, same hoes watchin'
Everything is fine nothing will stop me
Postpone college made more money
Nothing bout the pride tryna take more from me
Now I tell myself that I'll make that back
I'll take that stash I'll say that stash
Drop that soul I make that stack
Still won't hear what life is gone
It's Young CV with a capital
You won't get me spittin rapper flow
I rather show my niggas how to get the dope
At 18 I can sign to Jay [what are you trying to sell]
Get mine today I ain't trying to wait only time will tell I got clientele, my mind to sell
Cocky young fly black male in a fitted cap my chick run track got to sit on my lap
Tell me where she go to school
Freak when I'm tryna tap
Tell me where the cash at right when my fingers snap
Read my astrology
Tell me what you want out of me
I'm a hot commodity
Kill this shit noï»¿ apologies

Get that money (x4)
Aww man (x4)
(young veggies)

When I was younger I was easily influenced
When I got a little older I realized I was stupid
Heart got a little colder and that's how you keep moving
And that's when I found out I would get to it
I don't know man I feel like I gotta do it
For everybody around that I've influenced
She said Casey, "You lyin'", I told her "I didn't do it"
A lot of niggas say they rappin' but my shit movin'
