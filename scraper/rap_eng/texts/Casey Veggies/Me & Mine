[Verse 1: Chase N. Cashe]
I've been on my own road, for dumb long
The money got me gung ho
Hope y'all know
Ain't sharing with no dumb hoes and known foes
The struggle got my blood cold, and heart froze
Ask my shorty, I got chill bones
I'm trill though, she with me cause I feel strong
Real strong, give her something we can build, a real home
If she hold me down for real long, she a real one
See my mission is to live on through my own songs
From my spirit i make real songs, hood poems
I just wanna put my hood on so they feel good dawg
Cause they've been down for too long, send many niggas too marks
Many faces I've mourned Praying that a knee fall
Working from the bottom to the top until a tree fall
When I see the light that just mean it's meant for me dawg
Until I see the light, I'm a do what's meant to be dawg

[Hook: Chase N. Cashe]
All I got is me and mine, that's just all I need in life
My family and peace of mind, Some Hennessy and weed i'm fine
My money and some streets to grind, my legacy and a piece of time
Remember me for being fly, most importantly for being I

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Got niggas in the front, for them niggas tryna front
Like my hoes in the back, see don't know where they at
Always say you wanna fade, had to put him in his place
But let me tell about 'fore i mess up my feelings fuck up my j's, fucked up my j's
The boys too fly but i'm still from the hood
Make a mill off the flow, give it back to the hood
Baby girl fell in love with the whip game
Type of shit to make a young chick go insane
I'm retro you six rings, since the get go i had big dreams
Your chick bad but she acting up, put her in the back of the audi truck
We took them inside, it was out for us
Run through the shit like the alphabet
Every time lil mamma flex and take away all my stress
I shine hard with some fire broads, my chase n. cashe and anwduar
Take it back when we low key, and smash her out that leotard
This Peas and Carrots, game so rare
Knew that I would get it one day, praise God on Sunday
But I'm back to the money on Monday, like Uh

[Hook: Chase N. Cashe]
All I got is me and mine, that's just all I need in life
My family and peace of mind, Some Hennessy and weed i'm fine
My money and some streets to grind, my legacy and a piece of time
Remember me for being fly, most importantly for being I

[Outro]
Me and mine
Need in life
Peace of mine
Weed i'm fine
Streets to grind
Piece of time
Being fly
