[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Fuck what niggas talking 'bout boy I'm on my grind
Pursuit of happiness so money on my mind
People say duty calls and if it's on my line
I get a two minute warning bitch you on my time
Heard it through that vine
That I ain't kicked it and that minute they was missing me
Hold the trap, had to give â€˜em raps for their misery
Every snap I smile, the bitches make a GIF of me
I'm laughing out the bank on my way to the dispensary
Get my hair cut, my nigga Kenny do that shit for free
The amenities of living life like a fucking G
When will they understand that niggas can't fuck with me
And I don't need the throne just seat me in the lap of luxury
I'll be smoking grass till it's grass that I'm underneath
Chilling at the pad with a bad one for company
I make the haters mad with the cash I accompany
I know you think I'm spaz but this only what I've done for free

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Check my bank account and it was at like 53
Thats pretty solid for a young nigga born in '93
Never had problems pulling young chickens so she sticks to me
That is what often make my mind want to skip a beat
Stay focused you in the gray mode and
Just make more dope shit, you got to stay golden
As much I love to swim she got a gray ocean
And I can spice it up if I use 8 motions
Talking 'bout life's a bitch thats why I stay pokin'
And I'm all in her friend, thats who I lay low with
Ever since I could remember I've been winning, 18 and 0
Saw my self at the top and started grinding off the dreams and hopes
Went to buying expensive, getting here by expeditions yo
Forced me to believe all this shit I got ment for show
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
Young expressions with ambition, n' most importantly the vision
