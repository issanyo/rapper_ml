[Verse 1: Jay Swifa]
They say he getting too old
Most niggas get that money and they fold
They hate and they love it though
Turn a plain girl to a center fold
Holler if you hear me hoe
In a different bracket talking penny go
Turning corners in the Tesla hoe
Turning [?] room to a fiesta hoe
Oh you mad cause I'm flexin' oh
Hard-headed niggas never let it go
Oh you mad cause I'm flexin' hoe
Hard-headed niggas never let it go
Tell me what the fuck is it you waiting for?

[Hook] x3
Tell me what fuck is it you waiting for?

[Verse 2: Jerreau]
Tell me what the fuck is it you waiting for?
Same hoes backstage every show
Niggas count ya blessings, count ya hoes
The same niggas count ya pockets, you ain't know
The same niggas asking what can I hold
The same fuckers catching feelings, tell 'em no
I pull my own weight I'm flexin' hoe
My arm strong, I pull ya girl I'm flexin' hoe
We bought the bottles pour ya own drinks hoe
She never tell me no she tell me when to go
It's not a secret I just don't speak on it hoe
She probably like it nice and slow
I'm looking like the nigga you should know

[Casey Veggies]
Five hundred grand, damn the boy feel like the man
Let's hit Japan, I got swag from another land
She drive a Lamb', I'm gone make her drop them pants
I pop them bands, crib so big she brought her friends
Mix business with friends
When you getting money gotta be professional
I copped that Audi, might fuck around and cop that Tesla
Laugh on my way the bank while my girl giving me brain
Celebrate life all night, all we do is pop champagne
Me and my chick, we famous
I would much rather be rich than famous
One hundred bills on me, man it's nothing but fragrance
We only got one life to live, so baby let's go on vacation
Let's get it, let's get it, let's get it
Damn, I'm so damn impatient

[Hook]
