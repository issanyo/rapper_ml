[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, I put her on a track and let her rock the mic, though
Fucking hoes at nighttime with my ice on
Ride the coupe through the night, it's a light show
On my way to give a bad chick pipe, though
If you getting cash gotta pay the price, though
Once I got money spend more money on my life, though
Teeflii got hoes with him, bringing five more
Two things I want, 60 mil and survival
Real LA nigga to the core
Getting faded by the beach, beat the pussy by the shore
Make it work, getting to her this gon' hurt so good
She got junk in her trunk
I got famous out the hood
Veggie...

[Verse 2: TeeFLii]
Me and your body 'bout to have a party
Shit done got real
You make it do what it do
I'm the man, you're the Annie
I'm the nigga that's gon' beat it up, beat it up
Fuck that ho, where my weed?
Roll it up, light it up
Then smoke, then smoke
Put your legs to the ceiling

[Hook: TeeFLii]
Like bam, bam, bam
Bam, bam, bam
I'mma do it like bam, bam bam
They only hatin' cuz they ain't you
Annie sturn me up
Forget your girl, she gon' keep hatin'
Girl, you got the right to choose

[Bridge: Poo Bear]
Fuck that ho
You know the pain hurt so good
So good, so good
Pain hurt so good, so good, so good
Yeah, it hurt so good, so good, so good
Yeah, it hurt so good, so good, so good
Fuck that ho

[Verse 3: TeeFLii]
Me and your body 'bout to have a party
Shit done got real
I know you tryna get ratchet Annie
Yeah, you like to be on the bottom
You like to be on the top
You tellin' me to pull your hair
You tellin' me don't stop
You letting me do my thing

Girl, I'mma do it like...
