[Intro]
Customized Greatly
And we customized greatly
Yeah, and they customized greatly
Now everybody customized greatly
Feel good to be back man
Feel real good to be back
Imma start if off like this

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I'm leaving school early, I got a stack to make
This school don't teach me no swag so I guess that can wait
To chase the dream, you know how long that can take
But you better off being quiet if that's all you gon' say
Lookin' the eyes, sometimes you gotta realize
The way you feel tries to stop you from your real grind
I know niggas who would die for a real mind
But I got it so it's that "let's go make a mil" time
Life changing, rearranging, different stages
Different stages in different cities, man shit is crazy
Who would have thought I come to kill it, promoter paid me
Come back home, they run into him like "That's the same Casey!"
A grown man, them same problems don't remain to phase me
Still shining, still growing, still Customized Greatly
On the grind, they wasn't knowing now they gotta face it
Girl, you still on my mind and I ain't trying to erase it
Face my problems like its gotta be read through some pages
Speaking to God, swear I'm working on my patience
Was having a bunch of fans when you my favorite
But I got a bunch the plans, I'm running to the pavement
The streets of L.A. where I lay my pavement
Words spread so fast, a nigga out in Asia
Yea, be discreet with yo ? prolly get them all
The future is odd, I think it's time to kill them all
Asalaam alikum to all the flakers and the constant haters
Who constantly contradict themselves, and in person take the time to face us
To all the pretty girls who would probably take the time to date us
Attitude like a possum but her face like [?]
This the definition of customized greatly
All intertwined in these rhymes, it's all the shit that made me
Shout out to my pops kept me from going crazy
Without that don't know where I would be but swear I'm goin lately
This that ill shit yeah you like that real shit
That 18 out of high school on tour without a deal shit
That girl frontin' but swear imma make her feel this
And if not then imma hit the kill switch nigga I'm on


[Outro]
Yeah mean, I present to you Customized greatly 3rd time the charm
AW man, from the city of Los Angeles to the world, Casey Veggies
Yeah
