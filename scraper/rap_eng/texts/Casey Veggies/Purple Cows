[Intro: Casey Veggies]
CV, brought my team with me

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
While Jay was rocking fellas
I was probably at a show rocking acapellas
Buzzing [?]
And if you haters saw me, I can't help ya
Veggies is the name, I'm taking over the game
I got my [?] but I'm taking over her aim
Just saying I'm crazy, Jojo's made me
Keep playing ball [?] but my rhyme scheme shit
And these other rappers lazy
Yeah it's Casey, I just spit I never aim
I'm too cool, ask you girl, I got forever game
You hating niggas forever lame, I never change
My mind think of something fresh, I'm in my zone
[?] million dollar deals from my phones
These other dudes try but these other dudes clones
[?] let you know the type of shit I'm on

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Man I'm so far gone and we write these poems
Hopefully so you can recognize when we on
Profile plays make me feel like I'm known
Known, known, known

[Verse 2]
V2 for the young bucks, money come in big checks
Girls mention our name because they know we famous
Active, doing everything that you lacking
Numero uno, we times ten what you practice
King [?] of the fashion, blasting
Hear me through soundwaves, West Coast madness
Holla at bitches man these niggas ain't ready
Make it rain on your girl
But that's when the checks come, on to the next one
It's a [?] how we killing these melodies
Slow up the flow for my niggas getting dough
See the Polo logos from head to toe
Yeah I'm stitched in the finest, bow to your
No skateboards but my niggas still grinding
Closing doors on these weak rap niggas
Young vet in the game, know the world gon' feel it

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Man I'm so far gone and we write these poems
Hopefully so you can recognize when we on
And them profile plays make me feel like I'm known
Known, known, known

[Verse 3]
Whether iTunes or Amoeba I release tons ether
Delivering to any size speakers
Whether woofers of tweeters, I make a buck
Cargos and wifebeaters, so what if I got a gut
Give a microphone [?]
Make way for my vocab, I be spilling out my notepad
See I got the flow back, creates moments like Kodak
So sad to see these rappers going broke back
Faggot ass cowboys
You motherfuckers is a whisper compared to my loud noise
And I'm the crowd's choice
Spectators get excited when I write it, it's the tightest
Super 3 beats ignite it
My site is so high that I can see the city lights
And I'm so high, feel like I'm on a pretty kite
Shitted on my many mics and many venues
I tend to [?] like lunch food menus
Continue

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Man I'm so far gone and we write these poems
Hopefully so you can recognize when we on
Profile plays make me feel like I'm known
Known, known, known

[Verse 4]
Super 3, supersede
[?] bomb shit
Like a terrorist in a port-a-potty, awesome
Fire in the fists, throw hands like [?]
Fighter in the streets like Capcom taught him
Slicing up the beat like vegas hand, shave a man
Why so serious lil nigga? you make me laugh
You little jokers are posers, soft as a baby's ass
I go insane for the money, gotta get that crazy cash
And I'm fresh out the wrapper, diaper, sort of like a dagger
Baby that's my swagger from the Js to the haircut
Sort a like a boxer how I get head and butt, butt
I just do me, do me
I go through girls like a student with Lucy
And after they choose me, they just do me
And then I skrrt off in a coop with two seats

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Man I'm so far gone and we write these poems
Hopefully so you can recognize when we on
Profile plays make me feel like I'm known
Known, known, known

[Verse 5: Overdoz]
Most niggas [?] ain't ready to rock with
They be stalling then they walk it out
Real niggas know what I'm talking bout
Steady building their buzz got these niggas looking [?] now
Mad bitches feeling this swag, [?] talking now
Real talk these suckas [?]
And they tickling you down soon as you up, they miss you
Me and my niggas never had problems with y'all
We stay on top and we never plan to fall
Foot in the door, Overdoz freshen the rap game
Performing flammable acts, spitting that propane
They need to stop and pause, take a look at their facade
Cause they frauding all, they ain't got the guns [?] fall
Roughing the cop, serving the block, [?], it's that street cred
Show me your Glock, if you don't pop, it will be [?]
Little nigga, you brainwashed, you thinking the same thoughts
As the last nigga that fell, now you taking the same loss

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Man I'm so far gone and we write these poems
Hopefully so you can recognize when we on
Profile plays make me feel like I'm known
Known, known, known

[Verse 6]
Wait for no man, I'm not human
Know you old niggas really hate what we doing
Cooking up coke and CV still brewing
Racing for this paper but I'm feeling like [?]
Bullshit find me but I'm barrel like a bruin
Sitting on the throne in the city that I grew in
And I'm turnt up still with wet kush
That leave a nigga with that turnt up feel

[Verse 7]
Like a turnt up thrill, I'm too hot
The way that they move blocks
Beating kings down like uniform cops
Staying in the fresh prince while your uniform rots
I'm shroomed out on a unicorn
Watching mo' paper, mo' pussy, mo' pot
[?] with the cabbage patch kids, Young Casey V
[?]
Man, I'm so far gone

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Man I'm so far gone and we write these poems
Hopefully so you can recognize when we on
Profile plays make me feel like I'm known
Known, known, known

[Verse 8]
Described as the truth [?]
[?]
Wardrobe black, one drawer that support a [?]
(didn't know how to act)
You and those [?] from getting blown
[?] without you
And I'm feeling real cocky
Might rest my balls on your eye

[Verse 9]
From a childhood, 80s baby [?]
Black, red, and green rep where my family at
From the east side of Africa
From a small town, they call me [?]
And I'm walking with confidence, [?]
Gives a fuck what they say about my outfit
I'm quite dominant like my continent
I'm back on my bullshit, respect my conglomerance

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Man I'm so far gone and we write these poems
Hopefully so you can recognize what we on
Profile plays make me feel like I'm known
Known, known, known

[Verse 10]
[?] here, I give you the highs and lows
I paint a picture you can see when your eyes is closed
Got dough, got some of the fliest clothes
Got bands, got 'em loving my liner notes
And what you gon' see when the time is told
Is I've been where you are now a long time ago
So what I do builds something that they running to
Mixed with Casey Veggies, give 'em something new
Fuck is you?

[Verse 11: Casey Veggies]
I swear to God I'm seeing the light
This is the perfect situation to end it off right
When we living the life, doing shows going on before those side cats
And I ain't even got a deal yet
I feel like the people gotta feel this
Cause when they mention my name, they realize I'm the realest
Yeah it's Young Veggies, add some flavor to it
[?] whenever I say I do it
