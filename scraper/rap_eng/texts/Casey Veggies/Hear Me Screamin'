(Intro)

(Casey Veggies)
This is the story of a young man
Who dreams to understand
The whole world in his hands

(Verse 1)
Workin' hard tryin' to make it to the top rhymin'
Refrigerator empty had to eat the Top Ramen
I'm in L.A. where kids rock Diamond
That's to the homie Nick, what you do is damn sick
I be on my shit them dudes need to read the pamphlet
Tryin' to get a world, more than some little dances
We be in the wood nigga, you wouldn't even go there
Was a party by the forum, I went and did a show there
I ain't tryin' to act like its nothin' to make it
Ask the girls in my city, bet they mess with us baby
I just spit it from my heart, you ain't nothin' you fake it
Yeah I said it, you dread it like your mother's Jamaican
It's Young Veggies man, swear I made a couple of payments
To be the boss, hope the haters just love what I'm sayin'
To my city, that I know'll be happy I made it
And the rap fans that ain't to sure about Casey ya hear me screamin'

(Chorus 1)
I you love me than let me see it
Stop frontin' on me behind my back, and keepin' secrets
Hear me screamin', it was dark but now I'm beamin'
And I put it all in on my grind now you believe it
Hear me screamin', my vision was so scenic
And I added dedication and time, now you see me
Hear me screamin, you don't even know what you do to me, truthfully

(Verse 2)
You got me mad girl that I ain't even hit it yet
But I know you missin' when I used to get you wet
You used to do me wrong and I wouldn't even get upset
Cause when you gave me brain girl I swear you passed the test
Uh, in front of your friends you always tried to act
But I'm that immature kid that always had your back
We was in love, yeah girl I thought I met my match
But you always told me what I did wrong, what's up with that?
Yo act right, say we just friends but you was kissin' on me last night
I guess you can't resist me
I'm all in your head now you tryin' not to miss me
You goin' off to college, won't be able to assist me
I bet that kid that's your best friend be tryin' to diss me
What's that lame nigga purpose? That's the thing that always gets me
To the kind-hearted girl that so lost my history
So confused by our love, but be runnin' to get me, hear me screamin'

(Chorus 2)
Know you said it, but you ain't mean it
I was lookin' at you right in your eyes, but you ain't see it
Hear me screamin, we can't love if we keepin' secrets
And if what you got to give ain't real, that you can keep it
Hear me screamin', you got my number, you can keep it
And if you don't understand what I'm doing, then I'm leavin'
Hear me screamin, you don't even know what you do to me, truthfully

(Verse 3)
I know you love me grandma, you my star girl
You can't speak to me but I know who you are girl
You here livin' but its not you
If I could go back in time I swear that's somethin' I'd do
You the reason that I get done what I do
You my purpose, it wouldn't be me if there was no you
You was in that nursing home before '02
When I was young I couldn't believe it now its so true
It hurt my heart I won't be seeing you
But even more when I be in room 4C with you
I don't wanna see you like that, there's nothing we can do
But you been holdin' on, you so strong, I wanna be like you
I thought about you this evening too
I wanna put this whole verse through your feedin' tube
For my grandma layin' in bed, can't even eat her food
Love you so, wanna let you know that I see through you

(Outro)
