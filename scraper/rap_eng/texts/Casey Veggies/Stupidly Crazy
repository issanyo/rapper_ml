[Intro:]
Every weekend its a side show somewhere
Every club, every event
Somebody gonna start a side show
They gonna close the freeway down at the entrance
And start the sideshow on the freeway
It's stupid

[Bridge: Casey Veggies]
I know you see me out at the shows, oh
I see you all in the videos, woah
And you be fucking with them city hoes, woah
The type the stars tryna get chose

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, in my city I'm like 23, yeah
Or number 8 before the new steez, yeah
Shawty say she wanna do me
Once she made her mind up, I'm like "who, me?"
I know you see me out at the shows,oh
I see you all in the videos, woah
And you be fucking with them city hoes, woah
The type the stars tryna get chose, no
Yeah, she said her ex nigga been broke, damn
And Young Veggies boy you been dope, woah
We playing hoes like Nintendo, woah
These bad bitches like a rental, oh
It's Young Veggies girl imma boss
If you don't put it all on me, you might take a loss
Girl we can talk about it, we can take it off
Freebandz, new foreign with the exhaust

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh]

[Verse 2: Nef The Pharaoh]
I'm on somebody else main tuck
Pack wilding out like an in 1 game

Sick Wid It nigga make her squirt bitch flirt
Its that new Esco, that new Mustard, that new Neffy shit
Can't get no feature, you other niggas irrelevant

You know I love a ratchet from Richmond
This shit a hit, we lost Ali I feel like Sonny Liston
I'm a warrior, bitch we ball over Pistons
Draymond Green in my backwood
We don't fuck with no swishers
I hit your auntie and your sister, they in my system

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh]
Girl, I beat it up like you know what (You know)
Going, it be stupidly crazy (Stupidly Crazy)

Gone, it be stupidly crazy (Stupidly Crazy)

[Bridge: Casey Veggies]
(I know you see me out at the shows,oh
I see you all in the videos, woah
And you be fucking with them city hoes, woah
The type the stars tryna get chose) (x2)

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
I wonder if she still gon be here if I get low
This music took me to some places that I wouldn't go
So I thank God, grind, and I get more
The money go up and down like a '64
Damn, she ask me if I like pussy, I'm like man
You must not really know who I am
I ask she whether fast, should I take it slow
She told me she wanna young nigga with dough
And then we pulled off in the Range Rove
She know my story, I ain't gotta game hoes
I gave her the game, I don't play no games tho
I'm turning my side bitch into my main hoe

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh]
Girl, I beat it up like you know what (You know)
Going, it be stupidly crazy (Stupidly Crazy)
Girl, I got the club like you know what (You know)
Gone, it be stupidly crazy (Stupidly Crazy)
Girl, I beat it up like you know what (You know)
Going, it be stupidly crazy (Stupidly Crazy)
Girl, I got the club like you know what (You know)
Gone, it be stupidly crazy (Stupidly Crazy)

[Outro: Nef The Pharaoh (x5)]
(You know
Stupidly crazy)
