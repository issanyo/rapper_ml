(Intro)
It’s a little story about my summertime
Summertime

(Hook)
I was ridin’ slow, sittin’ low
Flippin’ grain, doin’ my thing
Baby girl ride it like she’s supposed to
Said baby girl ride it like she’s supposed to
Give me a couple weeks and I’ll be back again
With my homies too, you should bring your friends
Oh man, boy doing his thang
All these clothes, diamond ring
Dirty girl ride me like she’s supposed to
I said baby girl ride me like she’s supposed to

(Verse 1)
Your dime up to your mind?
'Cause you insane
In the membrane, when you gon' come get tamed
If I can take you home, can I be your sensei?
Shorty got me wanting to put a ring on it, Beyonce
We bumpin’ that dream, she fancy
I’m callin’ on you like Jon B
I’m the type to take her clothes off in the Jacuzzi
If there's enough us and enough of y'all
Then we can make a movie
Throwin’ out these groupies and my real girl tryna do me
Rolling by on my grind all the time
Looking at them California street signs

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
Everything wavy, we at the beach
I might touch her ass cuz it’s in my reach
In a few weeks, picking and coping a new lease
Rock the whole summer acting like I’s just the new me
But I’m truly the same kid since they knew me
Pulled up on my own street and passed up the police
She a bad chick with a Visa card
And she spot that shit for me, man she be goin hard
I love the summetime cuz in the summertime
I’ll be spending money, spending time, everything fine

(Hook)

Summertime, I suppose
Through the hood at the liquor stores
Just got home, I was on retreat
Back of the streets
Back in the lab, get back on these beats

(Hook)
