[Verse]

The Gucci proda and Louis was the bestest
The stussy union and undefeated is hectic
Yeah I'm always right but take a look at my left chick
Anit no such thing as a best fit, Yo
They took my swag from right where I left it
And thats an excellent pick up
Girls on the corners getting picked up
I take off and lift up
Priceless and thirsty's laughing with hiccups, Yo
I just need to wait for the big bucks
So we can ride 20 inches in big trucks
Turn the bass up, bob your head
And they know I'm on the job or red
Ain't nothing above my head
And thats some stuff god done said
Money is power and I love girls
So the honeys devour
I eat mics up for dinner
And everybody such a sinner
Forget your outside whats your inner
Oh and I don't have time for breakfast
Check was 10 gave him a 100 and I left it
Messing with the money is a death wish
And thats no threats snitch, Yo
Nice guys back went to diamond left with a LV hat
I can't tell you anything
But nah you can't tell me that
Just in everybody do it
But they can tell we rap
Left for a little but they can tell he's back
Bars after bars they can tell he snapped
See they swagger jack me, the swagger had me
But I had so much of it
So in my head you ain't touching it
New era nah kids are writing rhymes with pencils
I come precise with mine you'd think i use stencils
What I put out is what y'all in to
Can't be seen so imma have to tent you
Custom kids so different between me and you
Its a big difference
I dont rap about the neck glistering
But when I shine I'm going to be glistening
I just want y'all to listen in
Custom lyricist what I'm giving them
Touching mics so now I'm feeling it
Trying to figure out what my feeling is, Yo
Came in don't plan on leaving
Im hungry and they feeding me
Can't you see this is what I need
If music is blood I shall bleed
Taken one by one
They just receive
Haven't got there yet but I still don't wanna leave
Want it bad
Im begging on my knees
Rap hard
Bloods come coming out my teeth
Like rich boy man
I threw it on some D's
Just in honeys with the bee's
Pollute this man he copies what he see's
All bad now argues with the pea's
Only 14 but y'all will never guess
When I get a deal man y'all gotta make a guess
What he deserves
He's got all A's on his test
Just want success
Don't care about the rest
If he make it he gonna make everyone bless
If he was a bird he would throw worms on everyone nest
If he was a teacher he would put A's on everyones test
After a hard day just let everyone rest
Thats how he feels man
Thats what he sees
Such a big package but he's so bitter sweet
Reason I used it
Because this is so bitter beat
Yes the flow with the heat
Just listen you don't have to understand me
I won't come no more
Go ahead and ban me
