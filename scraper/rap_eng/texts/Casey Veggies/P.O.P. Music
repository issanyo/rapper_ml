[Hook]
Got a sack full of green, a cup full of brown
A bad bitch with me so you know it's goin' down
I told her once before, yeah, I fuck with you and all
But you know I'm out the door as soon as the money call
Money on my mind, she think I'm a rookie but I've
Been grinding puttin' paper over pussy (3x)

[Verse 1]
This ain't about competition, I'm just doin' what I've gotta do
A lot of dudes, want my position and take a shot or two
They aim off
Quit being lame and get you a dollar too!
Cut a dame off, she play a nigga for Donahue
Comical, funny, don't know what bitches be trynna do
Find a finer dude, there's only one eye, Monocle
Truth is, half of these rappers ain't even kinda cool
I see the jealousy in 'em, I'm livin' what they trynna do
Designer shoes with a matching fitted
Eyes low, glasses tinted
Rello Rhodes, you know, grass is in it
Lightin' up while I pass the Zenith
Cold nigga, take after Kenneth
Don't want nothing, cuz I have to get it
Real nigga, fuck a rapper image!
In my shoes, you wouldn't last a minute
I'm Malcom X, and I gets it by any means
Steady cream, got 'em ready for the team, so it seems, just
Forget the greed Ma, we never had money
So the most you get from me is cab money

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
So many racks I'm gonna pay, thought it was check fraud
Luckily it was some stacks that I had left off
They feeling left out, now I'm my own boss
You don't control your own world, you a wrong cause
I love my chick, she love me back, I'm just like Santa Clause
When I run it, hoppin' on my lap telling me what she want
If I don't do nothin', man I've gotta stunt
If you talkin' moving onions, we can chop it up
What's the point in doing something if it's not enough?
Like, why you mess with all these hoes if you ain't got they trust?
Same niggas actin like your homies, man they probably suck
If he had a chance, swear he'd probably throw you under the bus
I love spittin' game, we the same, man you're on of us
I done did my thing, got a name, but it ain't enough
Widening the game, hittin' lames, and it ain't no stuff
Contemplate them things, in my brain, gotta make it up
