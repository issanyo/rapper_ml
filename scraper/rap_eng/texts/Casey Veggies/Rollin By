[Hook]
To the make it to the top
You struggle, you fight
With all your might
You're rolling by
And one you're at the the top
You struggle, you fight
With all your might
You're rolling by

[Verse 1]
What people say to you and think of you is two different things
I just love you, I don't know what I made it seem like
I just see bright cause I swear you right for me
But I was on you too hard [?] site for me
So I can get my mind right cause we gon' do it
And I put that on my life
But this is why I fight, just listen to what I write
I'm in the sky like kites flying smooth like ice
I don't wanna move but I might go and get my grind on
So I can get my shine on
I just want a compliment for everything I rhyme on
You are my [?] you just got signed on, you know
You backstage at my show when I'm done rocking the crowd
You know we gon' go wherever you want to
Whatever you gon' do
Just make sure you include me, young CV
I'm on my grind

[Hook]
To the make it to the top
You struggle, you fight
With all your might
You're rolling by
And one you're at the the top
You struggle, you fight
With all your might
You're rolling by

[Verse 2]
What people say to you and think of you is two different things
So my team like the Lakers when they three-peated
[?] and I shouldn't have to repeat it
My grind something special, they believe it
And it's grind time, homie what are you on
Word to mother, [?]
I ain't never settling, I need more [?]
Cause them Gucci shoes, I'm tryna afford those
So I'm running through the city chasing more dough
But more so, we making records that's timeless
Josh Pea check your watch, tell me what time it is
I'm hard headed that's what mom said
But she know I'm tryna get it so she can buy it
That's right yeah
So leave that little kid shit at the door
Cause I'm making moves, making my dough
Grind, grind, grind, grind

[Bridge]
I'm on my grind
I am on my grind, grind
I'm on my grind
I am on my grind, grind

[Hook]
To the make it to the top
You struggle, you fight
With all your might
You're rolling by
And one you're at the the top
You struggle, you fight
With all your might
You're rolling by

[Verse 3]
Yeah I'm thinking bigger now
My heart is raging when I see the crowd
It's so amazing can you feel it now?
I swear to God tonight it's going down
And then I'm coming back up
I'm feeling like a rapper
That ain't never gonna act sus
So back up, you wack rappers act tough
But it's all love, we go through cycles
That's just what the people like though
That's why God told me places that I might go
Clear out, it's a iso
I gotta make sure that everything ight though
Let the keys play

[Outro]

[Verse 4]
It's like trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Or trying to turn a Hondo into a brand new Bent
East side, west side, it's all the same
Pockets full of lent
Listen to me while I vent
Picture the expression on my face as I teach you motherfuckers about strength
When you broke as a joke and can't cope through the kush smoke
The first option of a nigga is to sell dope
That's how it get when resources ain't reliable
Hustling ain't legit but we still can't retire though
It's heartbreaking when the bitch that you want
Got the phone, and the money, and the kicks that you want
So with that said, my friend the motto is "get bread"
You hungry, then get fed, the fuck you thought
Nothing handed, nothing taken for granted
The world is yours, it's about what you make in this planet
What is it you fathom when you smoking on the danko
24s, thin ass tires, a fat franko
[?] watch with a bezzle full of carrots
Better get to stacking if that's what you really cherish
I sold dopes to put [?] to my momma load
Twelfth grade nigga, marijuana bought my summer clothes
So get a job or a medical connect
Freddy Mac signing out, demanding niggas respect, huh
