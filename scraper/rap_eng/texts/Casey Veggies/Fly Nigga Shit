[Hook: Malik Emanuel] (x2)
Niggas on that fly nigga shit (x3)
I'm on that fly nigga shit

[Verse 1: Malik Emanuel]
Niggas on that Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles
I don't see you haters
Starting from the ground up, now we elevated
Hit my bitch 'fore I leave, tell I see you later
No you ain't got hoes, you a perpetrator
Give a fuck about your girl, I just penetrate her
Had to [?], I'ma see you later
All black on chrome, like a [?]
Got my music turned up, I can't hear you haters
I'm a fucking player, I'm a fucking baller
Pull a ho just for fun, I don't even call her
Nigga you a stalker, let the ho breath
Bad bitch, supposed to keep that pussy low key
I'm a codeine fiend, might OD
In the hood on my bed, I'm a OG
I demand my respect, you don't know me
Keep my hand on the check, young ho please

[Pre-Hook:] (x2)
Sing it, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly
I said sing it, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Ah man, ask your girl who that nigga?
She gon' say me
Young MVP, like KD
In the Coupe with a chick going crazy
Y'all niggas ain't grindin' y'all lazy
Baby girl she wanna fuck with young Casey
Talking hoes, I got a bunch like Braidy
Y'all pockets so slim, that's shady
Girl money a ain't a thing like JD
And a young nigga just signed to Jay-Z
Leaving markets, I ain't shopping at Macy's
Balling so hard, you haters better play deep
Boy you can leave the game like McGrady
So in love, get bucks with a nigga, that's fake love
You don't really fuck with a nigga
When we firsted starting seeing, was just fucking a nigga
But the boy so fly, now she stuck with a nigga

[Verse 3: Malik Emanuel]
My bitch roll my blunt, while I'm chilling, playing 2K
Then she give me top, off top, like a toup√©
Still is M.O.B, 'til I D.I.E, get paid
One for the money, two for the wings
Watch me take off from the motherfucking stage
