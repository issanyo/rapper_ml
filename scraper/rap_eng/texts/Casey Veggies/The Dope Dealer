(Casey Veggies)

Verse 1

The Dope Dealer The Flow special
How old are you? Yo, Youre special
Yo, The Kicks cool and the shirt nice
Customized greatly youre right
Cool nikes yo forget swagger
Haters getting stuck with the dagger
Why he do that? He had to
Instead standing around lets gather
Youre a tagger
Uncle dave,  the beats craze
The songs laid down
The scratch is playin round
Nigga Im too nice
Yo youre too right
Bright as two lights

Heres a classic just add it to the rest of em
Im better than the rest of em
Better than I ever been
Everywhere you never been
Nope nigga heaven sent
You get a mint
Side kick flips then i T moble dashed em
Im about to get passin
Money green as grass is
I pull up in the dragon
How bout 20 inch rims
I can't spit because i dont wear tims
We duckin like tim
Its nothing like win
You trying to get Casey

[Hook]


(Verse 2)
I Took that shit though
Three, three surgeries

One day at a time
It ain't the feel its face of the rhyme

Its About time
Up in L.A Times

That girl with me yeah thats Casey V's dime
Custom to the Casey Jones

From the night to the morn
These songs hit my eyes closed
