[Chorus: Zoey Dollaz]
I'm just mobbin' through the party with my niggas
Seen a couple bad bitches, fuckin' wit' us
See some broke niggas, hatin' on the side line
We just laughin' at them niggas givin' high fives
Oh yeah yeah
I'm just here to fuck the night up
Oh yeah yeah
Me and my niggas finna turn up
Oh yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Zoey Dollaz]
Turn up, uh, dark shades, red cup (woo)
Mobbin' through the party like wassup (wassup)
See a few chicks actin' stuck up (uh)
But, fuck it, we just here to get fucked up (turn up)
See some bad bitches (bad ones)
Bad bitches, real life, no filter, no catfishes (bad bitches, yikes!)
See some niggas hatin' on the sideline (haha)
Tell them niggas get a better job 9-5
I'm just mobbin' through, fly like a plane (fly like a plane)
A cup of water in my hand, I don't do Mary Jane
My niggas sippin' on drink and he rollin' up (rollin' up)
Fuck it, we ain't leavin' this party, till the sun is up

[Chorus: Zoey Dollaz]
I'm just mobbin' through the party with my niggas
Seen a couple bad bitches, fuckin' wit' us
See some broke niggas, hatin' on the side line
We just laughin' at them niggas givin' high fives
Oh yeah yeah
I'm just here to fuck the night up
Oh yeah yeah
Me and my niggas finna turn up
Oh yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, young Veggie's make these girls go crazy
Said she never met a nigga, that was so wavy
Baby, never left the lot in a new 'cedes
When you turn the lights down, she get X rated
Get pounds from the plug, we like 480
I been caught up in that gang, feel so crazy
I whip it up, until the product go crazy
The way I beat it up, never leave no statement
She the type of bad bitch, to borrow a car
And I'm a young rich nigga, ain't trippin' at all
She like I'm with my friends too, who coming with y'all?
It's just me and Zoey Dollaz lookin' for 'em all

[Chorus: Zoey Dollaz]
I'm just mobbin' through the party with my niggas
Seen a couple bad bitches, fuckin' wit' us
See some broke niggas, hatin' on the side line
We just laughin' at them niggas givin' high fives
Oh yeah yeah
I'm just here to fuck the night up
Oh yeah yeah
Me and my niggas finna turn up
Oh yeah yeah
