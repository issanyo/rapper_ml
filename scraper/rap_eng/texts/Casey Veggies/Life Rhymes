[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
It's that young nigga, that
Always spit them life rhymes
Always slept with the right dreams
I evolve in the night time
Baby give me them pipe dreams
Wash it down with some white wine
Don't be thinking that I drink
One shot and I feel fine
Only fuckin' with bright queens
I done made up my mind if you focus on right things
And realize that it take time
You will have a great time, everything go intertwine
That's what they told me mixed with how they show me
Plus what I'm already knowin, let's get this money!
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Hook: Casey Veggies + Jhene Aiko](x2)
Yeah, I got all the shit in motion
I got so much shit to do
I'm just grindin gettin focused
Man I put that on my crew!
I've been brushing girls off but baby
I've got time for you
I've got thirty thousand on me
Might run to the whole crew

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
The concentration this shit that's basic
And niggas hating is the same reason we ain't faded!
Could have lift the nation
I know girls that's in love with racing
Can't stand to be patient
And she need her friend approval just for her to mess with Casey
He a rapper girl, that nigga crazy
But you contradict yourself tryna down a nigga caking
Talking about this boy came in and paved it
For himself and his fam man, that's some great arrangements
I wouldn't call me famous
Just a kid that's gonna change shit
When I walk in this world, I thought I ought to make it!
Keep customer service, never automate it
Please don't worry, you know I got some plans
When that school bell ring my next grind start up
Hoes wanted sex when them checks got brought up
Girls complex, swear I don't even judge her
Tell me who is next, when the best grind is all us
Have you ever felt that like it worth it?
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah!

[Hook: Casey Veggies + Jhene Aiko] (x2)

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
The lifestyles of the young and wild
I done crossed roads in my life
Swear he's trying to tell me something now!
But I'm rocking, no stopping, my best girl in Compton
My ex girl never got me, my dream car, Bugatti
But I settle for Audi, my camera is a paparazzi
My checks read young veggies, my dad read young king's
The way I love her like Amerie
Cause it's one thing,
I really think she should stay with me
Cause young girl dreams
Shout-out my G'ma
Cause she made me a young believer
This day is beautiful
They respect us, play Aretha
I told my momma, I'mma take her where palm trees at
And buy her houses with dish washers and laundry mats
On tour no time to do chores, three months on my course
Stacking dollars for sure way better than before
I think that's just what life's about
Trying to figure it out
Finding new things to add, and hope that it all amount
