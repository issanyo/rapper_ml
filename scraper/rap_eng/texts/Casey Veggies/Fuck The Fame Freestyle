[Intro]
Yah, young Casey Veggies
Aw man, check

[Verse 1]
I'm just a young winner from a decent home
I rode my skateboard home so I ain't need the chrome
You see the skater vibe was a good reason they should leave me alone
On the bus in my own world in them headphones
I might sell it out the trunk, the people need this song
All my folks wait for better days, man it won't be for long
Long, nah, it won't be for long
Yeah, check

[Verse 2]
I'm just grinding the spotlight
All these people did this shit is not right
[?] check and [?]
All them other niggas [?] what I'm not like
Got her wet like we fucking in the rain though
Going hard pouring out champagne on her
Shawty flew that pussy straight to me
Steph Curry long range though
32 box in Madden, that's game over
Young nigga beat it up in the Range Rover
All this cash make your chick wanna change over
She came and got comfortable, she stayed over
Like [?]
She called me daddy like it's my first name though
It's one on one, climbing up the top
No cameras, we ain't worried bout the fame though
We ain't worried bout the fame though
We ain't worried bout the fame though
One on one, climbing up the top
No cameras, we ain't worried bout the fame though
We ain't worried bout the fame though
Nah, we ain't worried bout the fame though
We ain't worried bout the fame though
Yeah, we ain't worried bout the fame though

[Outro]
Yeah, Young Veggies you already know what it is
Audiomack, DJ Booth, what it is
Live & Grow
September 25, let's get it
Swag, swag
