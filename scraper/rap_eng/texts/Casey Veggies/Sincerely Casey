[Intro]
You knew I was gonna  write this song
You know everything you did for me
Momma you was the reason I dedicated my life in love
All them late nights, you know what I'm saying
Picked me up from practice, take my to school and all the unconditional love
Dedicated my life in love
I can't think of a, I can't think of a, I can't think of a
I love you momma
Yeah

[Hook]
Momma you was the reason I dedicated my life to love
I can't think of a better tune to write this song
Up early morning, making sure my life was bright
You was always working so I see you later on in the daytime
Really don't want you to work again, really don't want you to work again
Really don't want you to work again
Sincerely Casey, your little man
You was the reason I dedicated my life in love
I can't think of a, I can't think of a, I can't think of a

[Verse]
July 18th, 19-93
I came from inside you and life really surprised me
I can feel my heart beat like wait, wait
I can hear my mom speak, my baby, baby
My older brother 18 months prior, 18 months later new pacifier
Two little boys that you always ride with
And any plans you had, you'd put 'em aside for
The person I fly for, the person I die for
Whatever you stand for, I get behind yours
I Louis Vuitton'ed her and then I laced her in Prada
She said "Casey you don't have to then I told her I got to
You got a divorce and you was dealing with drama
This for all them times we were going through problems
Like yeah, they don't know what the odds was like
Appreciate you like Pac and his momma like
Uh, your son hot as a sauna, now we up in Bahamas
Yeah I'm loving you momma, like

[Hook]
Momma you was the reason I dedicated my life to love
I can't think of a better tune to write this song
Up early morning, making sure my life was bright
You was always working so I see you later on in the daytime
Really don't want you to work again, really don't want you to work again
Really don't want you to work again
Sincerely Casey, your little man
You was the reason I dedicated my life in love
I can't think of a, I can't think of a, I can't think of a
