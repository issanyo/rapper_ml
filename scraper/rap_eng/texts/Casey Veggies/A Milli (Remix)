A million females with good details
You shop retail, I hit the boutiques up
Flow so sweet huh? So conceited
Hit me on my beeper
You back in the Days Inn, I am on my leave
2000, I'm wiling, I'm styling
The boy bout to blow up, money bout to start piling
That girl is Italian
Y'all don't wanna know the outcome
The game you playing, I'm dealing with the lames, and

I'm wild, I need taming
You niggas better d-d-duck when I'm aiming

With a ? status fitted on my hair
And motherfucker I'm ill

Hold up, wait, all you niggas get back
Rehab flow: all a nigga do it ?
Dropped out of high school to get every dollar
Get it? GED: a real Rhodes Scholar
Drinking Milk of Magnesia cause I refuse to see a doctor:
That's sick, and Casey V asked me to murder this shit
DVR flow, you should pause and rewind me
Clown ass rappers over here trying to mine me
But this beat over his head just like
Diddy did Steve Stoute

You average rappers killing me, I mean really offending me
Talking about shit an average rapper hasn't really seen, like

I'm sort of like a journalist, writing what I see

Literally: yes, the article is all on me

I practice what I preach like I'm some sort of preacher

I'll have your ass on murk like sour lemon diesel

Cotton mouth, slavery, weed ?

Street cred like Big, me doing it big

Arrogant Veggies, you can't test: rude boy
