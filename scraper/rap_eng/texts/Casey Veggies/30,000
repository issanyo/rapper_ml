[Intro]
30,000
Veggies, Nero
New school, West Coast, East Coast

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
My nigga I'm awesome
Everyday Crest white flossing
I don't do this often but right now I'm New Yorkin'
Swag so, man I should've sold it at an auction
Niggas still steal it as I'm walking
Feeling like the next nigga here, I don't care I'ma get it
The way I spit the shit, so specific
Couple thousand in my pocket
Make sure them girls with it
Cause I swear they ain't dealing with no ordinary nigga
Right now I got my whole city popping
A bunch of options
They messing with them labels tryna stop shit, I got this
Give me my kudos now
My old chick so mad at my new hoes now (swag)
Got them girls eating veggies in the produce aisle (swag)
Gave it up one time, now I know you wild
But I don't know you now
I saw everything I needed, I could show you how
Veggies

[Hook]
30,000 yeah and they all love me now
Tryna get them off me
I got everything but I can't get them off me
Man there's 30,000 girls on me right now
Man there's 30,000 girls on me right now
And the whole world feeling my sound
Long day, take her home, cut the lights out
I got 30,000 girls on me right now

[Verse 2]
What the fuck you thought it was?
Spanish women ordered up
I don't give a fuck how many you bring
Just make sure it's more than us
Ice tea life we pour a cup
Swag is mean and my ora tough
Really didn't think I was gon' link with that Peas N Carrots, tore it up
Rip it down, Harlem is my town
And Soho is my second one, can't nobody mess with him
Stand tall, I'm leaning though
Baby got them angel eyes, balance on my demon flow
I'm feeling too alive, 30,000 vibrant faces
She ain't with it, then she tripping bitch tie your laces
Keep your two cents cause time's a changing
Now I'm all about my dimes, I'm John F. K-ing
I'm what you know nothing bout
Just got this new coat, shit ain't even coming out
She ask me why I sound so passionate rapping
I told her if I say it, it actually happened
Action

[Hook]
30,000 yeah and they all love me now
Tryna get them off me
I got everything but I can't get them off me
Man there's 30,000 girls on me right now
Man there's 30,000 girls on me right now
And the whole world feeling my sound
Long day, take her home, cut the lights out
I got 30,000 girls on me right now

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
30,000 groupie hoes
I get the best of both worlds
Young niggas shining, don't care what the time is
Cause whatever time it is, you still gon' be mine
Bitch I'm in the game, EA Sports
If she ain't cool with the couch, then take her to the court
It come to me, never ever forced
When my nigga come through, bringing 30,000 more
It's funny when girls say that I'm tryna talk to 'em
Cause really I'm just tryna open the door and walk through 'em
[?] I might talk to 'em
The bell run girl, you should start doing
Everything I say, you know damn well I don't play
Hop on and go dumb like they do it in the Bay
Girl god damn, you-you Beyonce
But when I'm done with you, you know you a Shawntay

[Hook]
30,000 yeah and they all love me now
Tryna get them off me
I got everything but I can't get them off me
Man there's 30,000 girls on me right now
Man there's 30,000 girls on me right now
And the whole world feeling my sound
Long day, take her home, cut the lights out
I got 30,000 girls on me right now
