So let me check my itinerary
Ummm alright
And I'm going to Japan, I'll be on the next flight
And my walk wasn't right so I copped the Air Nikes
I record music all day and all night
And I do a lot of things, I ain't saying they all right
But when I started rapping, all I saw was light
And everything I dropped, i-it was all tight
No I'm not soft, my pants might be tight
Whenever I start spitting, all they do is see fright
And yeah, yeah homie, we eat right
Casey are you done? I'm like nah, not quite

Yep it's Reesey, ladies love me
So baby, maybe I'll put you in a may-b
Sky is the limit, you know get Shwazy
Back on the block, old school Chevy suede seats
We getting paper so we stay tailored
Dressed in the best, we Supreme to the rest
Expensive taste, pink champagne
Jewelry shining, cameras blinding
Resorts and island, ski trips dining
The haters is crying cause my whole clique's shining
You rocking with the best, nothing more, nothing less
And we shining on these lames til the death, yes
