[Hook: Logic]
Try'na get it like me
Can't get it like me
Tryna get it like ...
Like me
Tryna get it like
Can't get it like

[Verse 1: Logic]
Chillin on the west side
Bringing out my best side
Where they only care 'bout bitches and how big their breast size is
Yes I is, on the come up daring all of y'all the run up 'cause you know I'm finna one up motherfucker uh
Pull up in the benz while the homie smoking medical
Only bring ya friends if them bitches look identical
The pinnacle of what we doing ain't no where round
Started from the ground always gotta hold it down
Now they think they got it 'cause they signed up on the dotted
But there's only so much money in the year that is allotted
Plus you prolly don't even know how it is divided
Motherfucker I got it

[Hook: Logic]
Tryna get it like me
Can't get it like me
Tryna get it like ...
Like me
Tryna get it like
Can't get it like
Tryna get it like me
Can't get it like me
Tryna get it like ...
Like me
Tryna get it like
Can't get it like

[Verse 2: Logic]
Acting like they got it but they really don't (they really don't)
Bitches say they love me but they really don't (they really don't)
Shut the fuck up and get out my face ho (fuck out my face)
Talking all that shit but you don't really know
Put that pen to pad watch them talk about it
All I know is real life they don't give a fuck about it
Take your chain, your bitch, your car get the fuck up out it
Real is on the rise all of ya demise
This is who I am so ain't no need for a disguise
I have been advised by the greatest that made it, to do it
Living legends but you never knew it
This record was written right before I got on the stage
My mind racing reciting lyrics from pen to page
Bitch I bet I record this record on the red eye
Just because I said I was a Jedi, bust like Beretta
Now feel my penetration no hesitation this is warfare
Like guerilla, bananas clips can be iller
Fuck a filler this is the realist
The symphony I'ma kill this epiphany's I can feel this
But, you?

[Hook: Logic]
Tryna get it like me
Can't get it like me
Tryna get it like ...
Like me
Tryna get it like
Can't get it like

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Tryna get it like me
I'm a real young winner
Might take her out to dinner
Tryna hit it all night
I put that on me, baby girl gonna feel it
I know she about her business
If she want it then she know she about to get it
Throw some D's on that bitch
Pull up in that Audi coupe feeling like Hercules in the whip
'Cause I'm dealing it, got it off the dealer ship
We be going hard no motherfucking censorship
Peas and Carrots squash hard to tell me what the deally is
She gonna roll with us like she need a ride to the crib (work)
She influence me to go hard, shout out to my niggas that's gonna go hard
We gonna get the profit player that just be the logic
Put my hands together prayed then I doze off
