[Intro: PettyPetty]

[Verse 1: PettyPetty]

[Hook: PettyPetty]
Real niggas gon' fuck with me
Bad bitches gon link up
You know we get them 8s and every time we pour we drink up
They know we get them bands
[?] yeah they know that
[?] blow that
Glock on my hip, you know I keep it like it's stuck with me
She see me down and around and now she trying to fuck with me
Tell them broke niggas that can't get it they can't fuck with me
Me and my niggas in another lane

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
In a foreign doing the [?] until it's maxed out
Baby girl throwing that ass until she pass out
Cut up and blow all of them racks, I took the fast route
In the bank making deposits and pulling stacks out
Oh, that's your girl then you better watch your lady
Young fly nigga, all I know is go crazy
Pour hundreds when we pour and we pour daily
Getting dough for the show cause the flow crazy
I'm from the city where them young killers they act up
Swear they ain't fight no more, they pulling straps up
Lil niggas ain't got no hustle, can't make a stack up
If you acting tough, my bro got some shit that make you back up

[Hook: PettyPetty]
Real niggas gon' fuck with me
Bad bitches gon link up
You know we get them 8s and every time we pour we drink up
They know we get them bands
[?] yeah they know that
[?] blow that
Glock on my hip, you know I keep it like it's stuck with me
She see me down and around and now she trying to fuck with me
Tell them broke niggas that can't get it they can't fuck with me
Me and my niggas in another lane
