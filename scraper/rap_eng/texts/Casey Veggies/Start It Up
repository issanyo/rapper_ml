[Intro/Hook]
Ok we gon flex it’s my time
Ain’t got none to waste go ahead and start it up
Ok it’s my year from here on out
Said every year is gone be mine for the taken
Said ain’t no doubts ain’t no room for hate
If you gon slow me down you gotta get the fuck
Ok go get your life get in yo bag and start it up
That my word, live and learn, go ahead start it up, start it up, hey huh

[Chaz Verse 1]
Ok let me speak, time to get this chicken, spend that there on everything
We can’t take it when we leave, I got shit I need
I know money ain’t happiness but I rather cry my heart out spending 50 g’s
That’s the shit I dreamed that’s just what I seen
Live within your means never knew what that meant
Said you always gon find the snakes when you cut down that green
I know you turnt girl but don’t spill that on my Gucci jeans
Keyshia kior, Gucci rings time to catch a wave
I know it’s my season cause He answered when I prayed
Patience is what He said, said you gon really see who for you when your time is cut
Luckily I been down so long my shit just started up we probably never stop
If I said it then I meant it bitch thats all I got
They gon smile in your face til you tell them no
You say yes a million times that went out the door
That just comes with growth true colors now you know
Hey ok ok

[Chaz Verse 2]
Uh yea ok we get it started on this side
I’m only down if your bitch down
But none of them ride like my bitch do
Yea on Sunday baby girl my chick fila
Before Instagram had it we been live
I don’t have no time for spare time
Priorities poppin, the rent’s due
Only thing I’m focused on is getting paid
Ain’t no money problems I got spending habits
But we getting to it ain’t no way around it
Ain’t no need for lying I’m a living legend
Took my leap of faith and I been steady flying
I ain’t picture perfect
But I paint it clearly with the truest colors that you ever seen
Iss a way that you go about everything
But bitching about it dont change shit just start it up
