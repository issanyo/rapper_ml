[Intro: Casey Veggies]
Y'all gon' feel this shit, yeah

[Hook: Kacey Khaliel]
Shorty want the million
She know I ain't got it now, She stay down
She know that one day I'ma make a million
I feel like I'm caught up in my feelings
Caught up in my feelings
I feel like I'm caught up in my feelings

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
She see them diamonds in my ear like "Damn boy, you been on your grind"
Told that girl I ain't got no fear, I got a heart like a lion
I'm like "Baby, hit my line" she was like "Baby, hit my line"
Girl you used to hit my phone all day, let me know that it was mine
We was young on the grind, swerving through them lanes
We ain't had no patience so I just charged it to the game
Charge it to the fame, baby that's insane
How you gon' fall in love with a real nigga then get caught up with these lames
It's like I'm caught up in my feelings
Got one that you could never find, girl that ass is mine
Shorty I know you could make a million
That pussy had me blind, on my mind, I think about it all the time

[Hook: Kacey Khaliel]
Shorty want the million
She know I ain't got it now, She stay down
She know that one day I'ma make a million
I feel like I'm caught up in my feelings
Caught up in my feelings
I feel like I'm caught up in my feelings

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
She's so wet that I flow
She get me so high like I smoke
Pulled up in that new shit I gave all the young niggas hope
I told my chick let's go
I'm the wave and she soaking
Young winner I'm dope
I got a hook, she can't go
I'm on my way to the top forreal
Getting cash and she cop a feel
We can go make a hundred mill
Get your mind right, I'm so forreal
I'm so ill, Pimp C I'm so trill
PNC the company, girl might just have to get you a deal

[Hook: Kacey Khaliel]
Shorty want the million
She know I ain't got it now, She stay down
She know that one day I'ma make a million
I feel like I'm caught up in my feelings
Caught up in my feelings
I feel like I'm caught up in my feelings
