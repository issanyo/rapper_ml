[Intro]
I'm in the 745
I'm in the 745 with the [?]
I'm in the 745 with the [?]

[Chorus]
I'm in the 745 with the [?], two pints I'm not nervous
She doing coke with no [?]
Just poured a 4, I'm moving slow they think I'm nervous
I've been getting to it so I bought my bitch [?]
I'm in the 745 with the [?], two pints I'm not nervous
She doing coke with no [?]
I ain't with the flexing so don't make me get this [?]
I ain't with the flexing so don't make me get this [?]

[Verse 1]
I pull up on 5th Ave to make these niggas mad
I'm sliding with two pints, they tucked up in the stash
I'm rolling with [?] with this cash I'm a stash
I'm a east side nigga, to the west we gon' [?]
I'm sliding around the street, I gotta watch out for the crash
[?] gone last
[?] if I'm driving fast, your bitch I'm gon' smash
She heard about me but I heard her pussy's trash
While you riding around flexing, you ain't really with the business
Pouring lean just to kick it, you talking more than bitches
Did I forget to mention got more syrup than the kitchen
We on Crenshaw and [?] eating chicken that's delicious

[Chorus]
I'm in the 745 with the [?], two pints I'm not nervous
She doing coke with no [?]
Just poured a 4, I'm moving slow they think I'm nervous
I've been getting to it so I bought my bitch [?]
I'm in the 745 with the [?], two pints I'm not nervous
She doing coke with no [?]
I ain't with the flexing so don't make me get this [?]
I ain't with the flexing so don't make me get this [?]

[Verse 2]
Heard your bitch is with the business so I hopped up in her mentions
I'm that nigga with the business so I had to get my issue
He crying over bitches, someone get this man some tissue
Got her hoeing around the city hitting corners, getting strips too
I be chilling in the trap, pour a four sipping big juice
It's a late night, I'm in the city in a new coop
Hopped out at the club, four bitches that's with no roof
When you with the homies take it off, it ain't no rules
You niggas acting hard but that's [?]
We hide a couple thousand last year, that boy old news
Your next move your best move, I'm so disrespectful
My chain so solid when I move, it don't move

[Chorus]
I'm in the 745 with the [?], two pints I'm not nervous
She doing coke with no [?]
Just poured a 4, I'm moving slow they think I'm nervous
I've been getting to it so I bought my bitch [?]
I'm in the 745 with the [?], two pints I'm not nervous
She doing coke with no [?]
I ain't with the flexing so don't make me get this [?]
I ain't with the flexing so don't make me get this [?]

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Aww baby I'm the man
Got me feeling like Diddy [?]
Aww I don't understand
She really [?] fucking for a band
[?] wasn't playing
I had to call [?] fucking in the Benz
Aww then she brought her friend
I said no discriminating, shawty we can get it in
[?] told me what's the price I'll serve ya
Baby bad but she broke I curve her
Pussy so wet a nigga went surfing
I need the whole thing or it really ain't worth it
