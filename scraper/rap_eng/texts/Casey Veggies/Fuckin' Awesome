[Verse 1:]

It's like right now
Yeah we on, name rollin 'round
Set up shop
On the clock and we open now
Be quiet now
The city knowin', gotta hold us down
What you sayin? I ain't winnin'?
You fuckin' playin'
Girl don't touch my hand, I am not your man
I do my own thing, I hope you understand
When I'm 44, I'ma still have 30,000
My pops know that his young boy fuckin' wildn'
Swear I be clownin', one night not on the town and
After that I Master P 'cause she know I'm bout it
Yeah we on shit, niggas already know this
He prolly hatin' 'cause all of his girls know me
Doors might fold down, swear I'm on a roll now
I got my own clique, nigga and my own style
And my main chick know that I'ma hold her down
Never blow up too big even though that's the focus now

[Hook]

People quick to ask
But so slow to offer
I couldn't get the ass
I told her I was off her
We fell asleep in class
And woke up bosses
And whenever they ask
They say I'm fuckin' awesome
Man I'm fuckin' awesome
Yeah I'm fuckin' awesome
Man I'm fuckin' awesome
Yeah I'm fuckin' awesome
No matter what the cost is
This is not an auction
They talk about me often
Man I'm fuckin' awesome

[Verse 2:]

Started out small, dunkin' man I'm Ty Lawson
In the sky, parasail, you parallel parkin'
Niggas think you affiliated, that's lotta ?
Kill people, burn shit, this that fuckin' arson
Need a bag in the booth, young boy barfin'
Girl pull up in coupes, I was 'bout to start shit
Then I looked at her, realized that was Anwar chick
Some niggas get high, they like don't ever spark shit
But I'm ready to ride and make it all worth it
Chickens all on my Facebook, man they be lurkin'
I love pretty girls with a nice drive
I recognize, get connected like Wi-fi
And now we sexin', getting hectic like a Sci-fi
She say she love you, but don't trust you, she might lie
New mind, new shoes, new lifestyle
Take her down, magnum man, homie no lifestyle

Repeat Hook

[Verse 3:]

Freddie said you like that?
Well come over to the crib I ain't playin' on iChat
Young nigga on it, one in the mornin'
And we all still be gon' be up in the mornin' makin' moments
I be over shit without focusin' make the coldest shit
Mama proper, she a little bopper and she don't pretend
I'm just boastin' in, goin' in, with these flows again
One thing I never do is slow down my hustlin', nah
