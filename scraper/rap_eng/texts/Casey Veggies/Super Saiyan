That's that shit a hater sound stupid saying
I'm out here getting paid while them boys playin'
I'm shining on 'em, feeling like a super saiyan
I'm going big on 'em like I'm super saiyan
A super saiyan, I go super saiyan
I'm feeling like Vegeta nigga super saiyan
I'm super saiyan like I'm super saiyan
I'm shining on 'em, feeling like I'm super saiyan

[Verse 1]
I'm shining on 'em feeling like I'm super saiyan
Pull up in that Rover or that coup√© BM
I be getting paid while I'm on vacation
I be getting laid like the foundation
When she give me brain, she go super saiyan
I be going ham got her cooking bacon
She know I'm the man plus she call me baby
Casey Veggies is an army, better yet a navy
Baby girl she come through then she top me off
She feel like a star, I let her drive my car
I'm going big on 'em, going super saiyan
I'm out of my mind, hoe I'm going crazy
Recognized on the plane so I know I'm famous
Recognized when we landed so I know we made it
She in my car, we hit the strip when we in Vegas
Veggies broke, that's that shit you sound stupid saying

[Verse 2]
CV a young G, yeah that's my persuasion
Audi A8 coupe with eight asians
They treat me like I'm Kanye West but I'm more Wes Craven
I told her get up in my car or get left playin'
She know that him a star, him above the law
Him like Pac Above the Rim baby watch me ball
You ain't never seen this 'fit, this ain't at the mall
Life is short so I stand tall unlike most of y'all
Young hood nigga catching model chickens
Still in Inglewood like La Tierra Heir Elementary
Since high school I had these fools hoes whistling
Some got real jobs, some got that pole position
I'm going fishing back on vacation
On a mission for more payment
The Peas and Carrots came in late vacated
But that girl staying, I'm super saiyan
