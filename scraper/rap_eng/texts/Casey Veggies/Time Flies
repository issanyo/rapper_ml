24 hours, 600 days
Time will fly while I go away
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
24 hours, 600 days
Nothing we can do, nothing left to say
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
It's so cute how you growing up now
I just wanna make sure I can give you enough now
You looking for a job and needed new stuff now
I'm just tryna get it if you with it, come now
Girl we can't be just friends cause I'm in love with a hard time adjusting
You wanna shake my hand now, we barely touching
Swear this feeling's so disgusting
On my way to love but I don't wanna feel rushed in
Cause I'm still young, I know I ain't learned enough yet
I know my shoes fresh but that don't mean I ain't upset
[?] can't even get enough rest
It's a cold world and I can't seem to trust yet
Living in a dream, I don't want to get up yet
Caught up in some things, you a suspect
But you just a queen, not sure if you should love yet

[Hook: Skye Townsend]
24 hours, 600 days
Time will fly while I go away
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
24 hours, 600 days
Nothing we can do, nothing left to say
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Told me you would go, should I believe you?
You don't know what you got til it's gone, guess I should leave you
Girl you owe me something, the only one to make changes to your mind
You make changes to your mind one moment everything is fine
Next minute you sit tripping, I can't recognize your signs
In the studio my mind racing, I can't remember my lines
Life moving so fast and people asking if I'm a sign
I don't know when the time is right
You can benefit off my gold and diamond life
New shoes, new cars, new clothes
All my life I done kicked it with new hoes
It ain't right but this is how it goes
Every night swear I be thinking about you
[?] amount to
Adding up my money is something I can count to
Count on me to come and get everything about you
Everything is something that I'll do

[Hook: Skye Townsend]
24 hours, 600 days
Time will fly while I go away
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
24 hours, 600 days
Nothing we can do, nothing left to say
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
I said 24 hours, 600 days
It's been a long time, I don't know how you got away
Questions in my mind like I could've made you stay
But my pride was in the way so I guess we'll have to wait
So I guess we'll have to weigh out options
Everything I needed turned out to be [?]
All them time you said you loved me, you was probably talking
Guess it really hurt me, I ain't used to taking loses
Time keep flying and I'm thinking about you often
My niggas say I'm [?] got me tripping
Got so many chickens, girl you had the vision
But right now I'm winning and I do it with precision
So lady you could get it but it might be different
I'm just saying though
So girl, if you tryna go
Go ahead, let a nigga know
Gone

[Hook: Skye Townsend]
24 hours, 600 days
Time will fly while I go away
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
24 hours, 600 days
Nothing we can do, nothing left to say
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Interlude: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, I'm just trying to find the perfect word to say to you

[Outro]
To say to you
To say to you
To say to you
To say to you
To say to you
To say to you
To say to you
To say to you
