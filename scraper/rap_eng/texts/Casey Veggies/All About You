[Hook: TeeFlii]
I know everywhere you tatted
Lemme see you get active
I'm gon' fuck you 'til you love me in a ski mask
In and out, just like a robbery
It's all about you
All about you
It's all about you
All about you
It's all about you
All about you
It's all about you

[Verse 1: Choice]
Gotta take the R out of free if you talkin' 'bout me
I do it all for the fee, you're Cindy Crawford to me
I done see Rihanna, Ciara, better then all (?)
And you regular too, you come from a part of the streets
Seen relationship problems, bitches fakin' they got 'em
Niggas be fakin' they don't, good thing we know who we know
If Noah's animals keep sinkin' the boat
I'ma fly away with my unicorn with a booty like you do porn
And you'da sworn it's too big, unless your body too small for you
Threw it back, like I bought it too small for you
All hoes badmouth, what you gon' tell 'em?
Got to treat you bad, to learn to treat me better

[Hook: TeeFlii]
I know everywhere you tatted
Lemme see you get active
I'm gon' fuck you 'til you love me in a ski mask
In and out, just like a robbery
It's all about you
All about you
It's all about you
All about you
It's all about you
All about you
It's all about you

[Interlude: Casey Veggies]
Every other city we go
All these girls get choose
But one thing I know
I never love these hoes

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Lil mama, it's all about you
We fuck the city up, ridin' in the coup√©
She say she with me for the long run
Like she ain't in it for the fame or just for the fun
She so suspicious, wondering if it's live I'm spittin'
I told her no, baby, get used to this life that I'm livin'
I did some things that I ain't really mean
I promised you that I would change, girl, you a queen

[Hook: TeeFlii]
I know everywhere you tatted
Lemme see you get active
I'm gon' fuck you 'til you love me in a ski mask
In and out, just like a robbery
It's all about you
All about you
It's all about you
All about you
It's all about you
All about you
It's all about you

I know everywhere you tatted
Lemme see you get active
I'm gon' fuck you 'til you love me in a ski mask
In and out, just like a robbery
It's all about you
All about you
It's all about you
All about you
It's all about you
All about you
It's all about you
