[Verse 1 - Casey Veggies]
Give me a reason why you think
The money ain't coming in
I run and spend like it's right before the bar close
A lot of niggas see me up in them bar clothes
It's summertime, but I'm still cooler than ?
Why hoes threaten on me like I ain't shit?
Telling me they're single and the shit that they ain't with
When they hit the crib, they couldn't picture this painting
Running around shirt off, I got girls fainting
Yeah! I got that shit that you want though, don't front though
Cause I'm on my job and I make it look fun, yo
I run through haters like akimbo plush tho
This young nigga at lunch, we eat a rapper for lunch though
I'm the nigga in the city, yeah, the reason you come for
Don't go no further than them Inglewood ? though
Stay over on Melrose where they sell clothes
While I be in the city sticking up like Velcro

[Hook]
Said she like me and she like her mom

[Verse 2 - Casey Veggies]
I told y'all 9 times I was the best nigga
That's why you see these lames jockin my fresh figures
Girls send the best pictures, pose for the cameo
Caveman flow, we're something like Neanderthals
I give it raw, you don't give at all, young nigga ball
It's going down, she hear my sound to take it off
I'm the Veggie man, that's why they eat it up
I'm getting veggies man, my money's stacking up
Haters backing up, them shows shutting down
On stage we tear it up, and now I spread it round
These rappers say they got flow, I got mines too
They walking by I zap em up: swine flu

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Casey Veggies]
Girl, there's like 3 of you and
I'm too much homie
I don't introduce myself cause they already know me
Damn! Tell me you know somebody better, or
A young nigga like me that's gonna get cheddar
I destroy competition then jam, Vendetta
Only kid in the alphabet ? need letters
The new Hefner, new sweats are way better
I'm trying to buy it out and throw stacks like Mayweather
