All these bad bitches wanna ride, oh

That pinky ring on my finger so official ain't it
This my real life, not just for your entertainment
She like "Casey, getting money is your mission, ain't it?"
I'm like "Yeah girl that pussy got my vision tained"
I'm a go all night and we gon' play this song
I might hit it from the back with my shades on

You can't get in, niggas fake, you a stranger
Taking risks every day and she love the danger
She ain't even tired, she ready to get it off
