[Intro/Outro: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, life rhymes
That’s all I know, that’s all I do

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Yo, I got some problems that you can’t relate
I got some condos that be out of state
We got Serato at the spot, though
And we party with some bottles, go full throttle, that’s the motto
If I pull up, she gon’ follow, used to hit, all them potholes
Picked up the tour van in Chicago now we pullin’ up in drop Rolls
She passin’ out, I be revivin’ hoes
I gotta sit down, we passin’ out at the Bellagio
She hand it to me like I order that
She hand it to me, I’m up the middle, she my quarterback
Been hittin’ sit ups, runnin’ laps, tryna get my core intact
‘Cause I look around, and my elders teach me time’ll pass
‘Cause it’s been fast since the last time I got a hall pass
Said I was goin’ to the bathroom, but really, I just wanted to swag
Lunch time, everything fine, when the bell ring we’ll be doing the day
Either we gon’ make a dollar or we gon’ try to make away

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
This my shit - that shit sound hard
After my show – she in my car
Started a hustle - now we stars
We hit the strip, she in my car, she in my car, she in my car
She in my car, she in my car, she in my car
She in my car, she in my car, her problems solved
Said this my shit - that shit sound hard
Started a hustle – and now we stars
And now we stars

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
So bring it to me like I ordered that
I’m downtown in my corner flat
Yeah – screamin’ “other people’s money, nigga”
So right now I don’t wanna rap
‘Cause I’m that nigga you don’t wanna jack
Yeah – she leave me, I don’t want her back
I got hoes, I don’t want her back
I got hoes, I don’t want her back
So shout out to Veggies
I’m not doin’ no feature for no nigga except me
My mom she love Pepsi, but me, I drink Beck’s, see?
Times are real hard, but the Lord he protects me
My niggas gon’ rep me, bitches gon’ text me
I’m fuckin’ with Lexi, on weekends especially
Write ‘til my hand hurt and then I go lefty
You want it? Come test me
And you’ll end up resting

[Hook]
