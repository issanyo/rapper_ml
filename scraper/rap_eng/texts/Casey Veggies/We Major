[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
It feels good to be home
Come on homie, we major

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
You know you got takes to get it
[?] rhymes I couldn't wait to spit 'em
New sneakers came out, I was late to get 'em
Just do your job
If not, I catch you in the two door side
It's so hard to get out the backseat
Got cool and then they swagger attacked me
[?] she back slap me
Sexual harassing, black on black harassment
Pass that, it was past tense
Got the ball and I ain't passed since
Never got in the game, I was last benched
Passed out on my last [?]
Got dropped down from JV to Fresh Prince
Yeah how cool is that
You the leader but I rule the facts
And the verse is finished
And y'all know I can't hurts to finish
[?] reimbursed denim
Graduated yeah [?]
Yeah  I stopped to [?]
Get the money by chasing dreams
Girls [?] and now I'm chasing queens
[?] crack laced in [?]
And niggas license facing fiends
So I pulled up on 'em with a new tee and a cool tux, homie
They like "Casey, how much can you loan me?"
I'm like "I don't know homie"
I'ma [?] homie
I don't need Ralph Lauren, the money don't me calone me
You can't clone me, have you realized that?
Graduation dropped and now the asshole is back
Now I'm shitting on you niggas, now whose asshole's that?
You can't talk to my girl, the asshole's back
I [?] give me a pat on my back
I passed on the tests but I remember you forever
I'm on top of y'all niggas like New Eras
Two minutes and something seconds is what I'm going for
My dreams is what I'm flowing for
Cause I'ma do some music, do some shows
Get a deal, I got to go
See this real, that's so
I don't know, got to go
Niggas know
We can float, we can go
To the moon and I'll be back soon, soon

[Verse 2: Starreon]
You motherfuckers better get back, get back
Just like Stevie, you can't see me
Get burnt like CDs
Money tall and green call it Luigi
Can't leave this game alone, this game needs me
Cause I'm just nice when I touch mics
Leave haters broken up like crushed ice
Takeover the world yes, I just might
Flow like a faggot shirt, I'm just tight
The flow [?] so hot out the microwave
Middle finger to everybody who like to hate
I make hip-hop straight for the children
They say I'm cold for this one, I tell 'em I'm chilling
I'm so crazy but there ain't nobody stopping me
Got to get my chips up, stack it like Monopoly
And if I land on your shit, I'm buying property
I'm just a mouse tryna cop cheese
He don't know how to spit so hard
I'm just tryna catch a break like a Kit-Kat bar, ya dig?
No shovel involved, me I'm like a puzzle to solve
You can't solve me, I'm sorry

[Outro]
You motherfuckers better...
You motherfuckers better...
You motherfuckers better...
You motherfuckers better...
