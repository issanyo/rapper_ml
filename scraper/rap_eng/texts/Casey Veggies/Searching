[Intro]
Ayy, say what's up to the haters
Now we getting paper
Thank my momma, she made me
Aww man

[Verse 1]
I said I'm thinking can I keep me on the wrap
Me and the homie, four door, three in the back
Shout out Anwar Carrots helped put me on the map
So it [?] me and my team on me it's a wrap
Me and the homies moving, you standing still on flats
All talk, cat stack type niggas
Listed to Ye first then start bumping to Jigga
Now I'm bumping myself
How'd this happen man, I don't remember
Now I got a new girl, my ex mad when I'm with her
Swear a young boy shining like a back full of glitter
First nigga when we was young, had girls sending me pictures
My dad probably predicted he produced a winner
I'm gone

[Hook]
[?] you to show me that you want me
Or else we going up and down
I lost the old me now I'm searching
Trying to pick myself off the ground
I'm like four days away from killing haters til they goe
Same girls used to diss me now can't leave me alone
I'm just staying calm and I swear I'm in my zone
Trapped inside my mind, can't even answer my phone

[Verse 2]
Everybody hating gave me a reason for my doubt
If that girl talking stupid, tell her close her damn mouth
Man I'm rapping on these tracks tryna show you what I'm about
Raised up in LA but had family down south
Man my little cousin died before she learned what life's about
She was only like five, shit  in my mind won't leave out
(Girl I love you, put no one above you
While you living upstairs just know I'm here and I trust you)
I ain't talked to ol' girl so I don't know what she been up to
But I know love crazy so I ain't even gon' judge you
Really had love for you, wasn't just tryna fuck you
But I'm about to be home so you'll be dumb if you want to
Bruh [?] last around these haters, I write my raps in a jumpsuit
I beat you so I can touch you
This beat comes on and it haunts you
You tell me what you need, swear the young boy confront you
Don't stand in front of the house, gangstas might really [?] you
I'm walking around on my pivot, no dreaming, I'ma live it
We puffing like Kobe Bryant, my nigga that's all swishes
I'm just a young nigga that's all about his business
Brought up from the real so blatantly how I give it
I'm gone, I'm on my grind

[Hook]
[?] you to show me that you want me
Or else we going up and down
I lost the old me now I'm searching
Trying to pick myself off the ground
I'm like four days away from killing haters til they goe
Same girls used to diss me now can't leave me alone
I'm just staying calm and I swear I'm in my zone
Trapped inside my mind, can't even answer my phone

[Interlude]
This song goes out to everybody in search of an escape
Even if you don't know where to escape to
I'm here for you though
I just wanted something nobody could take from me but myself
From the city of Los Angeles to the world, yeah
(My niggas is grind
[?] haters
I know you mad
Cause now I made it)
I know you love me, mama
You know I'm your man
You know I love you, you understand
Sleeping in Class
Don't sleep on your dreams
Have faith
(I'm gone)

[Outro]
I've been on my road, I'm gone
I'm on my grind, you know just how it goes
I [?] just don't know
I had to show y'all that I can do it myself
Baby it's like
I been on my road, I'm out of yours, I'm gone
I had to show y'all that I can do it myself
Baby it's like, like
Who am I? Man I just don't know
