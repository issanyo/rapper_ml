[Verse 1: Tiffany Gouche]
I remember the first day we met
Just knew our love would stay the same
But this sure side I've never met
And I noticed you changed when you talk to them

[Prehook]
Those friends who never had a love
And they always playing games
Telling you I ain't the one
So you might as well get sleen
Who the hell are they?
What do I have to prove?
Never comes to me and them
You should never have to chose between them

[Hook]
Lonely girls, lonely girls
Lonely girls, lonely girls
They'll try and take your love right from you girl
From you girl, phony girls, lonely girls
I can't believe you silly lonely girls
Lonely girls, phony girls, lonely girls
You shouldn't hang around with lonely girls
Lonely girls, phony girls, lonely girls

[Verse 2: Tiffany Gouche]
I try my best to eat, nowadays
But, you insist on questioning
If I show you the world, baby
Would you even notice me

[Prehook]
Those friends who never had a love
And they always playing games
Telling you I ain't the one
So you might as well get sleen
Who the hell are they?
What do I have to prove?
Never comes to me and them
You should never have to chose between them

[Hook]
Lonely girls, lonely girls
Lonely girls, lonely girls
They'll try and take your love right from you girl
From you girl, phony girls, lonely girls
I can't believe you silly lonely girls
Lonely girls, phony girls, lonely girls
You shouldn't hang around with lonely girls
Lonely girls, phony girls, lonely girls

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
I'm focusing, I'm getting to it
Why you tryna fight now?
Gossipping with your home girls
Tell them hoes to pipe down
Worry 'bout my lifestyle
You already know that life's wild
You gotta nigga waiting on it
And I need that shit like right now
It's a whole lot of very crazy things
Runnin' through my chick's head
Keep listening to what your friends think
Girl, I think you've been mislead
Grindin' on my 5th leg
I can't never miss bread
She been hangin' around with her lonely girls
Come fuck with a real nigga instead

[Hook]
Lonely girls, lonely girls
Lonely girls, lonely girls
They'll try and take your love right from you girl
From you girl, phony girls, lonely girls
I can't believe you silly lonely girls
Lonely girls, phony girls, lonely girls
You shouldn't hang around with lonely girls
Lonely girls, phony girls, lonely girls
