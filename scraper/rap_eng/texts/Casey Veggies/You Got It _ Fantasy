Let me ask you a question…
Do you love me?
Yea, I mean like do you really, really, really…
Got damn.. La la la la la..
Another love song

Baby you got it (yea yea yea yea)
It ain't no stoppin
Baby you got it
Yea, it ain't no stoppin;
Aw Man!
Baby you got it (yea yea yea yea)
It ain't no stopin
Baby you got it

She a Gemini wit mood swings
You can’t see through naked eyez
Keep me wonderin
I feel I’d regret if I never try
She say she put me on roller coasters
To keep me round
And make me wait four years
Swear that I’d just take it down
That’s love right there
Girl can’t you see that?
I ain't wana beg
But can’t you be that
Girl that make me better
Stay down through bad weather
And let my cheddar
Act as an umbrella
Ella, baby you got it
Yo pussy tropic
It’s wet and it’s leavin spots
On my bed and
I’m really lovin yo head and
All the things you thinkin
Got my full attention
Girl I ain't even blinkin
Your ambitions got me trippin
Cuz I ain't never seen it
Most these girls only wana be filled wit semen
And be taken out wit time like you really mean it
Man, these mental reps ain't letting me stop it
You on my mind right now
Girl You Got It

Baby you got it (yea yea yea yea)
It ain't no stoppin
Baby you got it
Yea, it ain't no stoppin;
Aw Man!
Baby you got it (yea yea yea yea)
It ain't no stopin
Baby you got it

Her faith levels just what I need to uplift my dreams
Baby girl this more than a fling
You mean way more to me
I love yo get down and everything you bout
You can come round and I will dig you out
Every time
I never let you down
I got you right by my side
When we ridin round town
I got pianos and the strings providing the sound
This for all the wonderful queens deserving the crown
Aw Man!
Every time; we let these other people
Get in between what we doin
So we need to get that together
That’s gon make it all better
Sometimes life throw you lemons
Cuz the taste get sour
When you dealin wit women
It’s like love is one thing you can’t rewind
She was focused on one thing
I was on my grind
In life, you always gon need something true
Baby you got it, I ain't never gon leave you
To the beautiful girl
That was so stingy wit my time
That inspired my mind
Even some of my rhymes
It was one of them times
You was at home, no ride
We on the phone, all day
I ain't think bout my pride
Never met a girl make me wana put that aside
I kno it can get too late
I wana do that in time
These emphatic lines
Runnin thru my eratic mind
Is a perfect sign...
That You Got It

Baby you got it (yea yea yea yea)
It ain't no stoppin
Baby you got it
Yea, it ain't no stoppin;
Aw Man!
Baby you got it (yea yea yea yea)
It ain't no stopin
Baby you got it

A lil somethin on my mind
To my rhyme book
Life change, lil mama got my time shook
Time change baby girl
Just get your flight book
Your love is real
As I spit it to these nice hooks...

Fantasy

I got it all for them girls that know where it’s at
Cuz we walkin right through
And our swag on attack
The DJ’s spinnin my song
And he bringin it back
I’m wit the homies

Said this is my story
Man, this is my life
Girl I’m gon get you in that thong
When the timing is right
I swear I love when you drop it low
And do it all night
I kno you want me

I said, what’s the deal
Let me kno how it feel
I got that zip lock bag
And she tryna get sealed
After I sign my deal
I’ma keep that shit trill
Yea yea you know me
(you know just how I get down)
My cousin got that lean
Put a Four in a Sprite
And I put on for my team
We gon party all night
I’ma live out my dreams
Til there’s no more in sight
I’m feelin so free
Show me something girl
Let me know that it’s you
That can give me what I need
Always keep that shit true
That’s the type of girl
I should keep around
That can help me
Run the whole scene

This is my story
Man, this is my life
Girl I’m gon get you in that thong
When the timing is right
I swear I love when you drop it low
And do it all night
I kno you want me

Don’t worry bout the boy
I do what I’m sposed to do
Right now I’m winnin the game
While I’m coachin you
That means you doin things
That you ain't sposed to do
But keep it low key…
Jugglin

Real life in this fantasy
Prolly bringin out the man in me
Prolly what I plan to be
Proud to know that my stance increase
Abruptly
Grew from the street corners wit pumpkin seeds
I go so hard
Told her to do the same when she on her knees
We had some odd dreams
Mixed wit Visine
Girlies wilin on me
[I] hear em all as the crowd screams
Baby girl been poppin
Since my young teens
Had her on lock, no stoppin
That’s my young queen
I speak for the youth
Wear condoms when you knockin boots
Cuz if you a hustler wit no kids
You can afford the coupe
Girl ride wit the boy til the time out
Take a trip to where time change and
See what I’m bout
