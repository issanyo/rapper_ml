Say girl, I really talk to you to hit your friend
I swear we like a team, and I'm in that shit to win
Look girl, you deserve some of this time I got to spend
But don't get to happy because in time that shit gon end
I swear we don't love them girls we just cappin up all the tens
And add the numbers up and thats enough to buy a Benz
Coolest out in LA, we on that fresh shit rockin' Tims
Polo on my button up and a clear lens
I use to wonder how to get it started but now it won't end
Use to just try to get the word out, but now they all my friends
Had to keep them dark Tennessees so yall remember me
Now they like "he young and he hot", I spit that 3rd degree
Them older niggas tryna murder me, they mad men they scared of me
Came and messed this thing up, my technique like burglary
I'm so Inglewood, man I think thats where they gonna bury me
And thats right by the Forum, should I keep goin'?
Everywhere I go shit, everybody knowin'
I just move them haters out the way, damn near tow em
Niggas got they hand out like its something that I owe em
But I keep walking straight like I know just where I'm goin
I'd never thought that I'd get recognition for it
But I swear I'm after my stars, now I'm just in orbit
We want the fame and the car because we workin towards it
And we ain't had no Mr. Feeney on some Boy Meets World shit

Na, I'm on my job no collides
Every move I make above like I drive in the sky
These old rappers so similar,now how should I divide
So I'm at these niggas neck, I'm a hickey in the skies
Damn, I'm clueless to where I am
I'm just livin' in the dream, won't woke up til I'm the man
Try to give these girls a hundred but they just don't really understand
So I'mma take em all down, I am Wilt Chamberlain
I'm a smile and do my dance I just don't give a damn
How these niggas hate on a kid with a plan
Seem like she real the way she holdin' on my hand
But I can see right through these girls, thats why I'm growin to a man
Yeah, I'm a show em that I'm better
How to trap for the rack now I'm goin for the cheddar
Got me hopin' for the better
Sleeping in class, drooling on my sweater
