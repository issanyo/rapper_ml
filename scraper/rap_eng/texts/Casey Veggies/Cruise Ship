[Intro]
Skrt-skrt
Yeah

[Hook: Zoey Dollaz]
Don't make me pull up on your chick in my new whip
Take her to the mall and buy her some new shit
Show her round, have her seeing all the cool shit
My diamonds wet, my body feeling like a cruise ship
Feeling like a cruise ship
I made her wet, I got her feeling like a cruise ship
Don't make me pull up on your chick in my new whip
Take her to the mall and buy her some new shit

[Verse 1: Zoey Dollaz]
Only beefing with niggas when I'm fucking they bitch
They know I ain't cuffing no bitch
I put no trust in a bitch
Once I'm done smashing I put a rush in a bitch
Shorty you gotta go get back to your man
I ain't tripping shorty I understand
But look just one thing though
Don't forget to put your ring on
I put your chick in my new Six
Yeah, yeah that's my new shit
The whip cream like a cool-whip
Drove around, yeah on some cool shit
And they taking cause I got it
Your bitch in my whip giving knowledge
Dark tint, yeah it's private

[Hook: Zoey Dollaz]
Don't make me pull up on your chick in my new whip
Take her to the mall and buy her some new shit
Show her round, have her seeing all the cool shit
My diamonds wet, my body feeling like a cruise ship
Feeling like a cruise ship
I made her wet, I got her feeling like a cruise ship
Don't make me pull up on your chick in my new whip
Take her to the mall and buy her some new shit

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Ah man
Baby so wet and that ass is perfect, damn
The way that she do it might buy her them purses, damn
And lately I've been killing all of my verses, damn
You can run up if you want but know it ain't worth it
Niggas thinking that I'm back pack
I'm bringing that South Central rap back
They told me they offered me 20 a show
Run it fast, ain't gotta ask that
Working hard I'm a lab rat
So much dough they got nothing to laugh up
I'm fucking the game
We going insane
Walk up to your bitch, "where the cash at?"

[Hook: Zoey Dollaz]
Don't make me pull up on your chick in my new whip
Take her to the mall and buy her some new shit
Show her round, have her seeing all the cool shit
My diamonds wet, my body feeling like a cruise ship
Feeling like a cruise ship
I made her wet, I got her feeling like a cruise ship
Don't make me pull up on your chick in my new whip
Take her to the mall and buy her some new shit
