[Intro: Casey Veggies & Jesse Rutherford]
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man, aw, man, aw, man, aw, man
The whip black and white
My bitch black and white
(On some mixtape shit like)
My 'fit black and white

[Verse 1: Jesse Rutherford & Casey Veggies]
I'll never decide, I've changed every week
I won't stay in the middle, I'll kill everything
Yeah, I'm stuck in between if I'm wrong or I'm right
I would ask for advice but I'll just do what I like
Can't get over the fact, people living a lie
Just to stay entertained, what a waste of a life
What a waste of a space, what the fuck is your point?
You're a waist with no spine, you're a waste of my time
I smoke 'cause I'm stressed, I try to get high
But it gets me depressed, (Oh) I'm just tryna get by
I'm just drivin' at night, I got no music on
I got no favorite song, it's just me and my thoughts (Aw, man)
I've fallen in love, I've fallen behind
I've fallen for her, more than once, only twice (Aw, man)
I fell in the pool, (Damn) got chlorine in my eyes
And it burned for a minute, but I didn't go blind

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford & Casey Veggies]
This is for my friends who play
In the old cafes and they kick it in the parking lot
(They call me one take Jake, baby)
(Aw, man) I been away from the scene
(Woo) But I mean what I speak, what I feel with a broken heart
(What that? Okay, I got that big fat snake, baby, woo, hold up)
I've been getting money all day, so I can spend it all on us
(Uh, they call me one take Jake, baby)
I've been getting money all night, so I can spend it all on us
(Haha, yeah, I got that big fat snake, baby)

[Verse 2: Jesse Rutherford & Casey Veggies]
Alright, alright, alright (Talk to 'em)
Yeah, yeah, you can't get me to spit, but I'm so hard to swallow (Woah)
My daddy is dead, (Damn) I've got no man to follow
And I know that I'm shallow, (Woah) but why shouldn't I be? (Woah)
I don't mean to get deep, (Uh) it's just one of those weeks (Aw, man)
Couldn't tell you the day, couldn't tell you the time (Yeah)
Trouble falling asleep, (Yeah) for the past couple nights
Trouble being alone, I've been losing my mind
But I don't want any trouble, it just chooses to find me (Aw, man)
Ohh (Oh, yeah, aw, man, aw, man, aw, man)
It just chooses to find me, ohh (Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man, aw, man)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohh (Aw, man)

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford & Casey Veggies]
This is for my friends who play
In the old cafes (It's like, yeah) and they kick it in the parking lot (The Neighbourhood, yeah)
I been away from the scene (Just walk around)
But I mean what I speak, (I'm seeing these different things about The Neighbourhood) what I feel with a broken heart (I've been thinkin' about you all day, this makin' me think about)
I've been getting money all day, (Think about life, you know what I'm sayin'?) so I can spend it all on us (I've been thinkin' 'bout you)
I've been getting money all night, (And all the things I'm gon' do, I've been thinkin 'bout you) so I can spend it all on us (I want you right here, you know what I'm sayin', right in front of me)

[Outro: Jesse Rutherford & Casey Veggies]
Said I've been thinkin' 'bout you, oh
And what we gon' do, (Yeah, I want you right here, shawty) oh
I've been thinkin' bout fallin' in love, (I've been thinkin' 'bout fallin' in love, you know what I'm sayin'?) fallin' in love
Well, I've been thinkin' 'bout you
And all the things we do, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout fallin' in love, (Talk to 'em, Jesse, talk to 'em) fallin' in love
Am I fallin' in love again?
