[Verse 1]
My daddy told me "Boy, you been the illest"
I told her baby keep the card, swipe for incidentals
My shit paid in full, ace boogy yall like rent us
Ay word out on the streets I been the boy, I'm independent
Five hundred thousand sold, I'm goin' gold, Master P shit
Really thinking platinum, y'all [?] on some weak shit
Call me what you want, I'm whatever that you see fit
Posing off on Instagram but really you ain't seen shit
Dropped Customized Greatly I was before my time
Volume 3 popped, they said this lil nigga gon' shine
Life Changes came, that's when I hopped up off a Porsche
Momma need a crib, my brother Corey want a fort
City showed me love and Mac ha, run it
Just turned 21 but I'm countin' old hundreds
They see them bottles coming and them hoes get to running
Some my niggas hoop, some my niggas slangin' onions
