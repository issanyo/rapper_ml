[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Let the mink drag on the floor
She snorting the 70s dope
Up in the ghost she said she need it the most
Quit tripping we having a toast
Step in and out the plane
She act like she Marilyn Monroe
All on the boat showing her boobies the most
Lets toss her and see if she float
We pulled over the car at the liquor store
And if these bitches ain't fresh as me, then what we in here for?
Simply, That nigga wild, Let that nigga go
Easily, just roll up the dope and watch me turn it to smoke and go

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Twenty to thirty trill hippies they circle around me
With skin leggings they rocking Marants, but they smoking for free
It's funny ain't it, bitches is destined to be
Living the dream, while you out chasing these hoes
She probably taste-testing my seeds

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Ooooh, that's why we never sleep
It's primetime
When I'm on the phone I'm talking O's
So It's buy time
When I'm on the road turn the lights on
Cus' It's my shine
So all these strobe lights and bulb lights got me

[Interlude: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, young Veggies
PNCITL, XX
YNM; young nigga movement
You already know what it is man
We run the world you all ready know
All the young niggas run the world man
Lace your boots up
Kill em niggas with the swag
Kill em niggas with the swag

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
I got this new obsession with stupid flexin' and best dressin'
This Travis Scott and young Veggies that's Peas and Carrots and XX
Niggas think they spit how I spit
Get what I get
Fuck who I smash
I pulled up in the Jag'
Roaches to hoes and they up in the back
I'm up in the back switchin' them lanes
And they thought I would crash
Gettin' some fang give a fuck bout' a name
Iced out carats and I'm going insane
You upset, cause my squad up next
I had enough that, I'm smashing with them back shots
She had a couple thoughts
Told her I ain't trusting that
What these niggas barking bout
Tell me what you tryna say
Boy I make more then your father
I'm sorta an author but more like your daddy
Ask 'bout the boy
Came from the city, we poppin' in Cali
