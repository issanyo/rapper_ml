[Intro: Casey Veggies]
Aw man
Damn
Right back at 'em
Way better
Volume 3

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Way more smarter than my last tape
I get way more harder when that ass shake
With my shit in that, I get in that
With the thought in my head like I hope it lasts
Real young boy that's making cash
I'm realizing I can make it stack
For a rainy day when it ain't coming back
We young niggas, we fresh swag
Got the whole world in the bag
Roof in the grass now his speakers on blast
Oh shit, made it to the news stands
As I grind hard in these new jeans
I never ever stop from where the weather really hot
Where the homie ran the streets and that's why he got shot
Used to bang on my nigga, that's why he hit the block
That's some peer pressure for your ass
Girl, tell me how I can destroy your past
You growing up, didn't know no better
And I'm blowing up, my show got better
When you create some shine you know what's next up
Streets start talking, name getting brought up
Hop on now cause this train ain't stopping
Used to try my hardest, still wanna be an artist
Never was a rapper, didn't wanna be trapped in
At school, no work, just a black pen
Composition pad where the kid wrote raps in
That's where I got sleeping in class
Never really dozed off but we dream so fast
I'm leaving my past, let it stay in my dome
At the hotel I just stay in my room
Stuck in my zone, answer my phone
Said I'mma catch my flight and I'm coming back home

[Hook]
Please don't let me go
I just wanna know
Told you not to leave
And I promised we would grow
Life is like a garden
You'll end where you started
Remind me of that feeling
When I wake up in the morning
Gotta let it go

[Verse Two: Casey Veggies]
Take you out to eat, bring out the freak
Can't tell you everything that it's 'bout to be
She know a young nigga stunting
Only dumb niggas fronting
Never run from the money
Give you a run for your money
Customized Greatly, same young Casey
4-number pin and I'm about to cop everything
She enjoy wins and the thrills that life brings
She go to school and church, that's wifey
Young Veggies, Young Veggies
This Young what? I'll say it again
You would fall in love if you gave me a chance
Trying to make me a man but I already am
Love of the game, don't put trust in the fame
Full of wack ass lames throwing salt in your name
That was just to let you know
Watch what you get into
Cause these fucking streets ain't what it's cracked up to be
Hate in my heart
Never been scared
Got another thing coming if you match up with me
On my way to stardom
Never was about problems
So my cuzzo going to handle that action for free
I shaded up and I got better
New whip, I dropped cheddar
In that new joint, I'm gon' met her
And I just ignore 'em, my phone ringing likeâ€¦

[Hook: Casey Veggies]

[Verse Three: Casey Veggies]
Let it go then let me know
If you find out what your mind 'bout
Ain't nothing better than a brand new mindset
Plus a Rolex and spot to spend time at
Find that when you figure where your grind at
I speak about it a lot because I'm 'bout that
In the back getting checks, she wasn't out there
Boy, I need your respect, I swear we don't care
We don't come at your neck, we get the whole spread
Break it down into specs and send it whole sale
Got cash in my pocket at the hotel
Having fun living life like oh well
She got the arc in the back
So I know it ain't flat
Girl show me where it's at
So I can go on and attack
She inspire me
High off life, man
A hit of that irony worth a whole lifespan
Real young black nigga from the hood
Getting money from the white man
And my girl light skin
Lot of rappers say "all the people used to doubt me"
But my whole city been holding me down proudly
Might catch C.V. chilling out in Maui
Bottle of Moscato and me and my girl 'bout it
Whole world yours
Learned that on Illmatic
Swear I been had it
Just had to grab it
I'm a sinner
And I know it
But God made me feel so heroic
Niggas be talking
Never even show it
Got something to say?
Feel free
I'm open
Roll with my music
Taught a lot of niggas how to move quick
Since I made my mind up I'mma do it back in '06
Shout out to my niggas that ain't no longer here
That don't mean them dudes died
They just no longer here
Got to learn to do it for yourself
And no longer fear
All that negative shit that people throw in your ear
If I'mma do it I'mma be great
Just tell me if you relate
You punchline-ass rappers represent the shit that we hate
Cause everything I spit helped me cop new Prada
Got new flows and I got new money
Young'n on his shit
And my brother need a whip
And he had half of his
Here go $2200
Bro I got you

[Hook]
