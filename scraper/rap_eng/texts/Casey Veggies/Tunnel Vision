[Hook]
I swear I left and now I'm back where I am(am, am, am)
And stunting and fine girls, keep me in my stance(stance, stance, stance)
But at times I remind girls that I dont give a damn
I said I'm focused

[Verse 1]
I was 2 feet tall, just scraching on my balls
Thinking that I was a man, but I ain't understand
My head so high feel the rhymes in my hands
Trying to make it happen for my fam
Cause rapping like a tan
I swear it takes patience
And a lot of dealing with the fakeness
I am tring to erase it
I am gonna take it
To the place niggas don't think I would make it
Do that even makes sense?
I lace tracks with a feeling thats ancient
I could see a picture trying to figure how to paint it
When pain hits it's only little that could fade shit
Me I hit the studio and make hits
Plotting on the payment, life is what you make it
And you niggas ain't gonna get nowhere hating
I can't even take this
Dodging all the bullets like I'm walking in the matrix
Los Angeles king just showing y'all the greatness, face it

[Hook]
Damn(damn)
I swear I left and
Now im back where I am(am, am, am, owohh)
And stunting and fine girls, keep me in my stance(stance, stance)
But at times I remind girls that I don't give a damn
I said I'm focused, cause the sky is falling

[Verse 2]
I was giving attention to things that shouldn't be mentioned
Now I'm focused on copping shit that's expensive
Seating in the Bent-lay burnin like incense
Bars like jail time criminal intent
Ball at the right time
This is an invention
Trying to do my thing
Put me on now
Seating in a Range with a Kool-Aid smile
Cool, hey, how the young boy do it like that?
I just retard on raps and go stupid on tracks
I just read all the facts I don't know how to act
I swear I'm with my shades on in the back
Hov in '09, we fade into black
Get a fade to the back, girls say I'm growing up
But I can care less about a girl I'm blowing up
And I dont need a girl that need me to do her
I want the chick with a good mind and good heart
And yeah when they ask about the girls I couldn't curr

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I was DTA, cause she be fake
And he just worried about what he can take
Cause she ain't worried about what he can make
He just worried about whats up for sake, the cake
The shit that niggas talking about
While I'm chillin im my silly city walking it out
And if I walk to the South
They'll like it cause its real and its recognized
Unlike y'all shit my life will never die
