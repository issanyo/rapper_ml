[Intro]
Ayo check this out, this how this shit gon' work
I'ma do me and you gon' do you, you know what I'm saying
It ain't that hard, it ain't that complicated
Call me Young Casey Veggies
I ain't gonna tell y'all niggas again
You know what I'm sayin, word

[Verse 1]
Fake fans, fake hoes
I'm sorry I don't take those
We party then we lay low
She was dancing on me like J. Lo
When I walk up in the spot everybody excited
Young winners gonna run the world and your chick gon' like it
Yeah fuck with a dreamer where the grass way greener
Let loose, take it easy
I know the life that you live make you meaner
It ain't about it, you deserve it
But if your actions are worth it
You ever did it all night when I turn off the lights
Girl them actions are perfect
It's something bout me though
I shine hard in the night time
They judge me for my flaws
But know nothing bout what's inside
You wanted to learn about me though
You could probably search on a website
She know that I be watching her
I was popular in my other life
I see what a name get you
Take the focus off the main picture
They tried to box me in
So [?] switching
Meet me on the moon, I'm in a spaceship Coop
Been scratching at the surface tryna make shit through
Your best friend [?]
Your mind ain't right if you ain't fucking with the crew

[Hook]
Before you speak on me, look at the mirror on the wall
If it was up to me we'd already know who we are
You wasn't here for me but I still answer when you call
Before you speak on me, look at the mirror on the wall
The mirror on the wall
If it was up to me we'd already know who we are
You wasn't here for me but I still answer when you call
So before you speak on me, look at the mirror on the wall

[Bridge]
Yeah, it's the mirror on the wall
People see me out and they show love and keep it going
And I wonder if it's real
I can't trust and I don't know 'em
The truth lies beyond, everybody's scared to show it

[Verse 2]
They telling me the cash is, I'm snatching that
I just spit them life rhymes and let them hoes imagine that
She seen me at the show, said she love how I'm so passionate
You got that kind of swagger shit
You the type of nigga I'd let you hit
[?] the pussy down and stay legit
You remind me of the mirror on the wall
Look at me as the king of that
And tell me who the fliest young nigga of 'em all
Diamonds in my ear
And baby my future like a crystal ball
Switching stereotypes up
Cause I always been against the odds
I got faith in the mirror on the wall
Got a whip in my garage and my mind is a god
And it grow to the sky so I know I'm too fly
Don't lose hope, don't stop trying
Close that door, girl we vibing

[Hook]
Before you speak on me, look at the mirror on the wall
If it was up to me we'd already know who we are
You wasn't here for me but I still answer when you call
Before you speak on me, look at the mirror on the wall
The mirror on the wall
If it was up to me we'd already know who we are
You wasn't here for me but I still answer when you call
So before you speak on me, look at the mirror on the wall
