Verse 1/

Yo, them same stuck up girls gon' be ugly when they grow up
I spent four years grinding in hopes that Ima blow up
And remained humble. Get a new chain but stay with the same hustle
You say you love me but I can’t trust you. Man this game ugly
I stay high just tryna stay above it
I’m in the streets just tryna stay in touch with
Everything that I grew up with. That’s how I make my money
Young nigga's on the rise and you can’t take it from me
And I put that on me, keep my circle nice and small I gotta couple homies
That’s on my day to day. I know a lot of people but I just stay away
Cause ain’t none of them gon' get me paid
I try to talk to god I’m tryna pray, but I just don’t know what to say
In life, you just gotta find your way
Watch your back nigga and guard yo face, in hopes that one day...

Life changes, things don't stay the same
Life changes, things don't stay the same
Life changes, things don't stay the same
Life changes, Life changes

Verse 2/
It’s so hard to keep a clear mind dealing with life’s field mines
Shit blow up once you think it’s all fine
But Ima keep on trying, like my grandma did
Been in that nursing home for ten long years
But she forever gone stay right here, that’s in my heart
I get attached to everything I start
And resort to action when it’s time to win, cause I don’t wanna end
Girl, I don’t want nothing if I can’t have it all
Not insecure, that’s just how I was taught
You moving on? That’s what I never thought
In this life I just need some love, only something true
I guess that’s why I’m tryna fuck with you. Don’t wanna be alone
Don’t wanna argue just wanna get along
Not in the mood, I don’t answer phones
Just need some time i’m tryna free my dome
Girl come over let’s get it on, and watch me never stop
To make up for all them other times...

Life changes, things don't stay the same
Life changes, things don't stay the same
Life changes, things don't stay the same
Life changes, Life changes, Life changes
