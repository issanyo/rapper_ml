[Verse 1: RJ]
I wonder how my ex bitch feel when her friend said I was on the radio
Cause you could be my ex girlfriend you keep worryin' about these hoes that I used to know
That ain't for you to know
What you ain't happy with what you got? Then find you another spot
Searchin' for what you missin' I know this ain't what you not
In a perfect world, you'd be my only girl
With side bitches auditionin', it's me against the world
I ain't got no preference, I just like bad ones
They be in my messages, you be spazzin'
No specific questions, shit just be random
I don't buy pussy, I just buy Magnums, let 'em know
Them last year birds ,I had to let 'em go
Cause new fish in the sea, tuna casserole
They never get the picture 'til i strike a pose
They actin' shows, attack some hoes
There's mad hoes that'd love to break up a happy hoe
You gotta go [?]
But I suppose you be leavin' 'em, how you fall back
It don't matter where I'm at

[Hook: RJ]
You always think I'm out cheatin' (cheat)
Spendin' my time with another bitch ('nother bitch)
You be on my line like the government (government)
I ain't signed up for this punishment
You ain't runnin' shit
You can do better, you can bet I wish you the best (wait until tonight)
You think you can do better, you can bet I wish you the best (wait until tonight)
You always think I'm out cheatin'


[Verse 2: Choice]
Now you heard this wolf got a sheep, uh
You cussin', [?] what I reap, uh
Wonder why we hangin' on, while I got a freak, uh
Cause it ain't about what I got, it's about what I keep, uh
Cousins see me shoppin' with a light bitch
Group chat, you, you text me where I'm at
I spot you, textin' her reply back
Buy her a business put the two ahead 'til they mind that shit
Who you gon' leave me for?
Another nigga doin' the same thang as me
None enough change as me
Dick can't hang with me, sayin' whatchu do to pay like me?
Who you gon' leave me for?
Nigga you used to see before I found another sea before
Two gustos, seein' with your eyes closed
Don't get mad when them side eyes comin' from my side hoes

[Hook: RJ & Casey Veggies]
You always think I'm out cheatin' (cheat)
Spendin' my time with another bitch ('nother bitch)
You be on my line like the government (government)
I ain't signed up for this punishment
You ain't runnin' shit
You can do better, you can bet I wish you the best (wait until tonight)
You think you can do better, you can bet I wish you the best (wait until tonight) (RJ, what up?)
You always think I'm out cheatin'

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Girl you look good, but I wish you better
Real L.A nigga and I'm with whatever
The money make her backflip, she do it for the cheddar
She young with a lot of time, but It's now or never
I'm like girl you love me?, she said Hell yeah
She the type to stay down on welfare
But so coincidental that a nigga on
She think I'm out with the groupies, so she had to hit my phone
Yeah, this how it goes when you're known
It's a lot of right ones, but the time always wrong
Wrong, gettin' to or puttin' on
What the fuck is goin' on girl we used to get along
But...
