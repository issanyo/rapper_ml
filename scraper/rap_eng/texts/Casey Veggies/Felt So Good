[Intro: Kent Jamz]
Do you feel me?
Do you feel me?
Do you feel me?
I don't think you feel me
I don't think you feel me
I don't think you feel me
I don't think you feel me
I don't think you feel me
I don't think you feel me
I don't think you feel me
I don't think you feel me
Do you feel me?
Do you feel me?

[Verse: Casey Veggies]
Some shit too good to be true
Some shit just end before it start
Versace lenses in the dark
I ain't hiding from my dreams, just hide from the narcs
Make sure bad chick ride when I park
And we straight to the crib, ain't no walks to the park
Cause I don't even love her, I don't even need her
My girl says she loves me, should I believe her?
Unless the homies was too right
[?] well I guess you right
[?] that's the shit I didn't do right
Then you saying you're not with the mission
Like are you saying I'm not what you're missing
Kissing and kissing and I don't even get this
But it's good though, I ain't even with this
I'll talk to you later, girl you tripping

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
As long as my pockets fat
I don't give a damn where that chick is at
And that's because the simple fact
I ain't getting played that's how I act
In your face like you gon' come back
But why would you leave? Oh, you don't want that
So I guess I'm on some other shit now
I went to school and I went to practice
I came home like, what's happening
Turned some beats on, wrote some raps and
I guess that's what clear up how I'm acting
Music is the only thing that give me satisfaction
Anwar hit me and it's time for some action
So now I'm worried bout mapping out my plans
And I swear all of y'all should understand
God damn, damn
Uh, cause it get like that
Then it switch right back
Same shit like that
Make a nigga wanna stop and switch right back
But then shit turn right
Like just to the hood cause my life got right
Yeah, and it felt so good, do you feel me
Yeah, I said it felt so good, do you feel me
Yeah, I said it felt so good, do you feel me

[Outro: Kent Jamz]
Do you feel me?
Do you feel me?
Do you feel me?
I don't think you feel me
I don't think you feel me
I don't think you feel me
I don't think you feel me
I don't think you feel me
I don't think you feel me
I don't think you feel me
I don't think you feel me
Do you feel me?
Do you feel me?
