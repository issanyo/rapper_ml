[Intro: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, damn, uh
Diamonds so big man
Diamonds all around me
Chains so big, yeah

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I'ma get you high tonight
All eyes on me, ready to die tonight
So fucked up that you can't drive tonight
We gon' set the whole city on fire tonight
I ain't fall in love yet but yes I like her
Girl you the wifey type, not a one nighter
Step into the life of a west side rider
You could spread your wings too but yes I'm flier
I'm bout to progress and all that shit I spit is so refreshing
I stay golden, try to stay away from all the stressing
Sometimes a bad situation is a great lesson
Sometimes a bad conversation hold a great message

[Hook: Elohim & Casey Veggies]
Where you tryna go
Where you tryna go with all that gold
Where you tryna go, where you tryna go
Where you tryna go
Where you tryna go with all that gold

[Bridge: Casey Veggies]
Chain so big, chain so big
Chain so big, chain so big
Chain so big, chain so big

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
I'ma get you high tonight
Penthouse suite, put you in the sky tonight
So much gold but there's much more to life
She want them diamonds and them pearls, get your morals right
I just stumbled upon a jackpot
Felt chain downfast sreet to make the last spot
Grind time, I turn my crib into the cash spot
Whoever on top, I'm coming for that spot
Where you tryna go with all that gold
Young boy from out the hood with all that soul
We hit all them different cities, I need all that dough
Tryna keep a couple options in case all that fold

[Hook: Elohim & Casey Veggies]
Where you tryna go
Where you tryna go with all that gold
Where you tryna go with all that gold
Where you tryna go with all that gold
(Where you tryna go, where you tryna go)
Where you tryna go
Where you tryna go with all that gold

[Bridge: Casey Veggies]
Chain so big, chain so big
Chain so big, chain so big
Chain so big, chain so big

[Outro: Casey Veggies]
(Where you tryna go with all that gold)
All I do is shine
(I just stumbled upon a jackpot)
All I do is shine
(I just stumbled upon a jackpot)
