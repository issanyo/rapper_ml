[Intro: Casey Veggies]
Ayoo Meco, we started this shit
Yeah I flex, nigga
So what?
Flex

[Hook: Compton AV & Casey Veggies]
I'm just out here grindin'
All this money got a young nigga shinin'
I'm a real street nigga, I ain't lyin'
I do it all for the muscle, I ain't tryin'
Watch a young nigga flex (flex)
Watch a young nigga flex (flex)
Watch a young nigga flex (flex)
Watch a young nigga flex

[Verse 1: Compton AV & Casey Veggies]
A nigga been hoppin', it's a cold game
Before I made it rappin', I was sellin' cocaine
Same nigga runnin' with the same old game
I might've made it outta Compton but I ain't gon' change
Gettin' money watch a young nigga flex
I'm with the shooters, watch them young niggas press
Why these niggas hatin' on a young nigga grindin'?
A ring on my dick, tell these hoes to get in line
Then I bag hoes, take 'em home and smash hoes
Then pass hoes, to my niggas don't let 'em tag hoes
Cashed out on the foreign you know we crash those
I don't know what happened, the money made me an asshole
Flex

Watch a young nigga flex (flex)
Watch a young nigga flex (flex)
Watch a young nigga flex (flex)

[Verse 2: Compton AV & Casey Veggies]
Took my 80 to your bitch, then she came through
'Cause nigga you ain't me, and I ain't you
Same nigga still runnin' with the same crew
Bitch we been gettin' money, hoe this ain't new
Baby you should fuck with me
I'm just a young nigga, I be on my grind
Baby you should fuck, with me
I be on my shit, I got money on my mind
I be on my grind, on some double up the re-up shit
On some grindin' all summer, nigga we up shit
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
I'ma die rich and take this money to the grave
Flex

[Hook: Compton AV & Casey Veggies]
I'm just out here grindin'
All this money got a young nigga shinin'
