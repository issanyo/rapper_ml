[Hook: Leven Kali]
I'd rather be alone but I'm still mobbin' with the crew
I'd rather be alone but I be checkin' in on you
I'm always by the phone, but I been sippin' on the goose
And I never let you know, so I'm not trippin off of you

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Sometimes I'm on my own just tryna figure what to do
I said I'm never goin' home, yeah I been sleepin' in the stu'
Lil mama gettin' grown, and now she pull up in the coupe
And she don't wanna be alone, she said I only fuck with you
And now I know better, I grow better
Three months gone, I'm a go getter
Ever since I was a young nigga, I always been a trendsetter
I been special, you should know better
Way back when I had no cheddar
We fucked around, I still held you down
Girl the time is now we can grow together

[Bridge: Levet Kali]
I told her hurry up and wait for me
You ain't gotta stay for me, I can't roll
You always got a lot to say to me
But you went and changed on me, that's so cold
But you know

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Leven Kali]
I know you got that on the low but we want that good shit
I put on for the 310, but they want that hood shit
She said stop playing with my heart if you can't fix it
I kick her out the jammy like girl you gotta chill, chick
