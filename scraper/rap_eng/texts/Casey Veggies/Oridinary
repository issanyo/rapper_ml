{Chorus}
Not standing still, im making moves
Even if I gotta break some rules
I been grinding too hard for me to lose
To be honest wit myself im tryna keep it cool
Keep it cool?
Other niggas not
Got me feeling like they got my spot
And I want it back
Check what im seeing out of my vision
From my outlook I see no competition
I dont need no hand outs or new friends
I just need mo' ends so I can cop me a Benz
This shit real

{Verse 1 Mani Coolin'}
Check myself
I dont need no extra help
I been grindin too long puttin out these songs wit no manager I put my own self on
Believe that.......
Niggas better see that
I ain't playin no games, want money fuck fame
Every nigga say that
I want both mixed in two
I wouldn't rap if I wanted one
Ima get this shit done
L.A. the city I run
Thats my shit represent it
Let me not forget to mention, my first tape I had that trending
On twitter I had that trending
Got the city up on my back
And that city up on my hat
And a lot of people round runnin up
Just when yall thought I ain't done enough
Man I did too much
Niggas keep talking
When I ride the Benz, nigga keep walking
Yeah its like that but the crew gon eat cus if I make they'll be like me
Whats the point of this?
If I can't put my team on, can't buy my mom a home
Can't cop a new whip can't cop the new shit tell everyone im on
If I can't I dont want this
If I can you know im focused
Mapped out the plan
Shifted the gear
And now my shit's in motion

{Chorus}
Not standing still, im making moves
Even if I gotta break some rules
I been grinding too hard for me to lose
To be honest wit myself im tryna keep it cool
Keep it cool?
Other niggas not
Got me feeling like they got my spot
And I want it back
Check what im seeing out of my vision
From my outlook I see no competition
I dont need no hand outs or new friends
I just need mo' ends so I can cop me a Benz
This shit real

{Verse 2 Casey Veggies}
Back then
Never thought that I could do it rappin'
Now im on my shit
Go and take a pick before it get too late
Dont act fake
Im a real young nigga I do my thang always show love and that won't change
Yeah that won't change
Thats too ill
They tried to get me for a few deals
But ima need a few mil
You too still boy make a move
Im breaking rules
Make a bad chick face the facts she gon throw it back dont know how to act I just made a stack and im going wild
Going in/
Straight swag, she walking by and get no pass
Ima get on that put in the bag
Do it fast just like my life
Champagne and its on ice
Campaining its our night
You ain't taking from me, im making money and everything is alright

{Chorus}
Not standing still, im making moves
Even if I gotta break some rules
I been grinding too hard for me to lose
To be honest wit myself im tryna keep it cool
Keep it cool?
Other niggas not
Got me feeling like they got my spot
And I want it back
Check what im seeing out of my vision
From my outlook I see no competition
I dont need no hand outs or new friends
I just need mo' ends so I can cop me a Benz
This shit real (repeated)
