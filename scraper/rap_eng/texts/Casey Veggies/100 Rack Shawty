[Verse 1]
Pullin' up in that skrrt, through the exhaust man
When I couldn't get that win, I take a loss man
Inspiration for the kids without no flossin'
I'm bout to get back to the city, fuck the cost man
I ain't got no plans of backing down at all, at all
I'm still above ground, I thank the lord, oh God
Busy feeling like Jay-Z, it's a new Roc-A-Fella
Roc Nation signed that deal now all my fake friends gettin' jealous
But I never hate on my squad so I just let y'all tell it
This music I got, this dope that weed I let y'all sell it
This life shit hit you strong and you gotta inhale it
It's a lot up on my mind so I gotta tell it
This a gunfight, how you gon' bring a shank?
That money in my reach like I work at the bank
I'm fighting for that peace like I was MLK
A young boy turn that dream into a better day

[Hook]
It used to be a dream, now we ballin'
Ain't no window shopping, yeah we bought it
I hop up in that uh
Hop up in that thing and push start it

Hop up in that thing and push start it

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah don't mind, girl I do this all the time
If I'm fucking with you girl you know you gotta be a dime
She started messing with the boy and then I turned her into mine
On some ball shit at [?] we sipping on some wine
Do it once, do it twice and we still gon' press rewind
Got it going all night girl I'm about to blow your mind
Yeah, yeah I'm thinking about the times I was on my own
Grinding late nights a long way from home
To keep it one hundred, I'm so hundred but I still think I'm the shit
I'm so fresh, last night I should've took more pics
I just fell in love with beats, had to stay up out the streets
Got the West side in the trunk but I get love in the East
Feel like I've been in the league ten years I need MVP
She was like baby I got your money like I'm ODB
I say girl you playing for the squad, you ain't coaching me
Up late nights while these niggas sleep
So that's more for me

[Hook]
It used to be a dream, now we ballin'
Ain't no window shopping, yeah we bought it
I hop up in that uh
Hop up in that thing and push start it
Baby said she wanna get naughty
She wanna have a...

[Verse 3]
You niggas can't hide, it's something you fronting you know I'm a problem

You know it come out of her purse, it never come out of my wallet
I'm living my life like a movie cause I know that they watching

Fuck all the hating my nigga, let's go get fly or something
Girl don't even talk about it, I can see in your eyes you want it
