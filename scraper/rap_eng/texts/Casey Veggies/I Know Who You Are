[Hook]
Now, you ain't gotta lie to me, I know who you are
Come around, don't be actin' funny, I know who you are
What the reason you've been frontin' for? I know who you are
I don't know just who you stuntin' on, but I know who you are
It's okay, it's okay, be yourself, go ahead
It's okay, it's okay, now, I know who you are
It's okay, it's okay, be yourself, go ahead
It's okay, it's okay, now, I know who you are

[Verse 1]
Sittin' on the couch, baby, I know who you are
Could tell from your dress that you lookin' for the stars
Tryna keep it cool, even when they play ya song
But your body keep talkin' and your eyes say it all
It's okay, be yourself, go ahead, break a leg
I've been waitin' for the show, show me somethin', show and tell
Show these haters I ain't pussy, if you wanna, take a smell
If I had one wish, I'd throw 'em in the wishing well
It's okay, take the charge, now I'm back to ballin'
This ain't a motherfuckin' movie, don't know what you'd call it
Actin' moody when you know this ain't your first time
Here, take a sip of this Patreezy, baby, get your mind clear

[Hook]
Now, you ain't gotta lie to me, I know who you are
Come around, don't be actin' funny, I know who you are
What the reason you've been frontin' for? I know who you are
I don't know just who you stuntin' on, but I know who you are
It's okay, it's okay, be yourself, go ahead
It's okay, it's okay, now, I know who you are
It's okay, it's okay, be yourself, go ahead
It's okay, it's okay, now, I know who you are

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
I know who you are, four hoes in the car
More girls in the trunk, we gon' break the law
We shoot if you draw, smash her if she call
We some young stars, I win, don't lose at all
I'm on my second wind, my chick more than a 10
We was the best of friends 'til I tried to sex her friends
It's a sunny day, I rock Versace lens
For my birthday, she gon' cop me a Benz
I like girls with money that know who they are
Baby independent so she's going far
Stuntin' in a rental, that's a loaner car
Nigga be yourself, cause that's what I'm on

[Hook]
Now, you ain't gotta lie to me, I know who you are
Come around, don't be actin' funny, I know who you are
What the reason you've been frontin' for? I know who you are
I don't know just who you stuntin' on, but I know who you are
It's okay, it's okay, be yourself, go ahead
It's okay, it's okay, now, I know who you are
It's okay, it's okay, be yourself, go ahead
It's okay, it's okay, now, I know who you are

[Outro]
I know who you are
Frontin' for your friends, baby, I know who are
Tired of them lames, baby, I know who you are
Don't you be ashamed, I said, I know who you are
Yeah, I know who you are
Same team and I'm stickin' with 'em
I know who you are
So why you actin' different, nigga?
I know who you are
Said, I know who you are
I know who you are
