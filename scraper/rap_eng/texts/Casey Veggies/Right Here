[Intro: Curren$y]
Player shit, though, you can't control
If bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
If bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
We only came for the money, them hoes came with it
Bonus edition
A nigga like me ain't tripping, I was focused on digits
You ain't heard from me in a minute but nah I wasn't chillin'
Cause I was in the kitchen
Stocking up that inventory that new raw heat I been recording
Going for it, collecting Porches
Betting on race horses at the bottom I started
Though I went the hardest
Climbed my way to the top
And copped Ferrari drop
The street low buzzing block
Talking bout what I got
I worked hard
And catching stunts on these bitches is my reward
Been too busy chasing checks to run behind a broad
Wherever you go, there they are
Trying to fuck on stars and top dogs who live above law
Rich niggas in the house, they ain't fall

[Hook]
If bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
If bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
If bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
If bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
If bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
If bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
If bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
I can't relate to these niggas that's pillow talking with women
That got no game to keep 'em but they just depend on spending
Money coming and going, my mind stuck on a million
My brodie told me you got it, stay focused and fuck the feeling
Fell in love with the game, somebody was so appealing
She love the way that I came from nothing to go and get it
Got me thinking bout my shawty, she was riding from the beginning
Way before the fake love and all the evil intentions
Bitches come with the fame, money come with the vision
I'm really stuck in the grind, yeah baby that's how I'm living
I'm zoning
I'm really in the lab plotting on my moment
I know you don't believe me, I'll be back in the morning
I need my own space and my own time or I can't grow
I can't front, my baby girl been on my mind since I've been gone
Sometimes I get to thinking I'm probably better off alone
I been working baby, I ain't had no time to make it home

[Hook]
If bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
If bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
If bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
If bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
If bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
If bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
If bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here

[Outro]
If you knew better, you'd do better
You understand me
Yeah
