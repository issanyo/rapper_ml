[Intro]
Young nigga but I got a lot though
Ain’t nobody go as hard as I go
Your main ain’t fucking with my side hoes
Sexy chubby nigga
Even though I got a pop flow I go
Aaaaaagh!
Bitches think I’m psycho
'Cause I fuck em and never say hi though
Tell ‘em that it’s only cause I'm shy though
But everybody know that’s a lie though

[Hook]
Hayibo, Ginda mfana
Bare ginda mdala
Ok, ok, Baya qcala
Bathi phinda mzala
Bathi phinda mzala
Bathi phinda mzala
Bathi phinda mzala


[Verse 1: Cassper]
I cannot pretend that I’m fucking
With any of you niggas in the game
I done did everything that’s to be done in S.A
So I might move out to LA
Made reservations for 28th
Looked at the time it was 4:28
Bought the 6 and the 428
Did all this shit before 28
She wanted me so ka mo bella
Ka mo setla
Apologies to whoever o na mo leka
Probably o tlo mo nyala wa mo
Rata
Ke o khawathile
O ba bone bana ba
I know the future
All of your fans should be
Expecting all kinds of defeat
Zimbabwe, Nairobi, Nigeria
London
Bothle ba tlala ka ntwan’ ya le
Hippie

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Thank God, I just hoped out the Lambo
I just copped a quarter chicken at Nandos
I’m balling she say I got handles
I fuck her then I'm blowing out the candles
She salute me she know that I’m a soldier
She grabbed on my dick I'm like, hold up
Thirty racks in the bag at the hotel
I just got cashed up by the promoter
Them doors open up like a folder
Grab my iPhone up out the cup holder
Gave the vallet a hundred said, hold it
I'm the man in these streets I thought I told ya
New fifth, new whip spreading hope
Stay sippin [?] lets have a toast
Out in Africa doing the most
Just look when Cassper pull off in a ghost

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cassper]
Young nigga but I got a lot though
Used to dream about it with Makhado
Used to be a strug, ten niggas on a bottle
Now I run the game I’m my motherfucking idol
I just had a sold out show in Malawi
Just a little kid from the kasi
Made it from a Kayo Star to Versaci
Made it from a Kayo Star to Versaci
I make a million a month, you make about 500k
Sometimes when I'm out of the country
I can make about a million a day
Shit don’t really even matter man
I know the rain like the weatherman
I used to save all the hoes
Now I don’t give a fuck like I’m celibate
Don’t get involved sheba fela wena
Don’t get involved sheba fela wena
When you ask me who’s running the game?
I hit the chest like I’m Benylin
Ha ke na nako ya di tshele tshele
I’m about the game like Maselesele
Fede manyora ra phusha
Fede Manyora ra igerezela
