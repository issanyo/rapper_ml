[Intro]
Yeah
I don't think they ready man
(Customized Greatly)
We gon' do it like this

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I'm tired of fake teachers cause life is real
Ask some niggas how many mics I kill
The [?] the feel
Customized Greatly man I like the meals
Stayed in now, I'ma become more
Didn't do hooks but I needed the encore
I'm about my cheese [?]
Sean handed me the bars of professional class
Fell asleep in class and lectures pass
But it was a bunch of shit I already knew
Heard another rap song, now I'm ahead of you
I've been custom, you niggas so basic
So I had to [?] just to chase it
Casey Veggies put a little  hot sauce on it for y'all to taste it
Don't you crave it? Yeah you might get it for free
Sean told me I was Vitamin C
Young nigga flow man, he's about to [?]
I don't know how to act, I'm too real
It's me, I don't care how you feel
And the legacy has just begun
KRS, I'm number one
I'm God's son, it's just some fun
Kill y'all niggas on this lyrical shit
[?] we got miracle chicks, yeah

[Interlude: Jsean]
This nigga coulda gave me some kind of introduction or something
Do I even got to say my name anymore?
Well, I would like to present to some and introduce to others
That nigga that's bad than a mother

[Verse 2: Jsean]
Can I get an encore if you don't want more
I'ma spit this raw til you get each bar
I don't care less if you guys don't feel me
I'ma keep spitting til you get some feeling
Now motherfuckers put your hands to the ceiling
To the ceiling, to the ceiling
I came, I saw, I conquered
[?] at the sold out concert
Even though my songs skip a beat, Jsean didn't skip a beat
I need no beat, that's all [?]
I was just sick til heal me
Fucking with that white bitch, tried to [?] me
Spitting all this, y'all still don't feel me
Why? Cause I'm not Pac? I am hip-hop
And I am not dead, I am 2Pac
(They not gon' catch that, I got to dumb it down)
They said Pac was alive, he was living in Cuba
I'm just comparing hip-hop to that rumor
If you ain't alive, you can't have no future
But I see my future, it's looking kind of bright
At night time with the lights off
It's so bright that you could leave the lights off
Every rapper want a chain and shine
But I something different in mind
Every rapper want a chain and shine
But I got something different in mind
(What the hell are you waiting for?)
After Casey's verse, it was me, me, me
(What the hell are you waiting for?)
But after me, there will be no more, more, more
What the hell are you waiting for?
