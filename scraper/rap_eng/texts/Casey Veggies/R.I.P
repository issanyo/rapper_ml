[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Take a drink, take a toke, young niggas ain't got no hope
Or maybe it's deep inside but they just too blinded to know
R.I.P. my nigga ghost
Livin through that Live & Grow
Grew up on Centinela & Beach, yeah right there by that corner store
Right there where them niggas post, drug dealin and blowin drow
Po-Po come we gotta go, we no-no talk to five-o
But as a young black male dude tryna dodge a cell
But I'm always followed by them cops lights
They got me livin' in a cell, tryna put me in a box
But I'm bout to break out this shit is not right
My nigga Tyler told me now we in the spotlight
The time is now and nigga tell em what your life like

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
It's great, I'm just bein' honest
When the green is coming like Iâ€™m mowing the lawn
Fuck the censor nigga you could use some commas
The numbers don't add up boy you want greatness
Dr. Right now mothafucka we hate patients
Now put your hands up like them niggas that didn't make it

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
I can't deal with the fact that you gone
Momma cryin family stayin strong
I can't deal with the fact that you gone
Momma cryin family stayin strong
Rest in Peace my nigga
Rest in Peace my nigga
Rest in Peace my nigga
Rest in Peace my nigga

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
PNC the recipe
Thank God that we blessed the streets
Carrots and the Peas is gone but I continue the legacy
It's some niggas still alive but in my eyes they dead to me but I forgive and I forget and now they distant memories

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
I can't deal with the fact that you gone
Momma cryin family stayin strong
I can't deal with the fact that you gone
Momma cryin family stayin strong
Rest in Peace my nigga
Rest in Peace my nigga
Rest in Peace my nigga
Rest in Peace my nigga

[Outro: Casey Veggies]
This song is dedicated to anyone who's lost their lives
Whether it be the police brutality, gang violence, brothas killin brothas
Moment of silence for Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown, Oscar Grant
Rest in peace
May you live forever
