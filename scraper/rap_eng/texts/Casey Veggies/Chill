(Verse Casey Veggies)

Life switch so much, i need a nice gift
My last chick ain't allowed up in my whip
Thats real shit
I keep it moving til I make six
Then i double up and get to twelve
Switch it up
I'm CHILLIN
She love when I switch the style up
Riding 30,000
And i been getting my miles up
Stack it up, keep riding
Until that shit start to pile up
Homie i dont know you, only real niggas around us
My pounds up
Benihanas and popping collars
Never stopping
The game got it, so imma rob it
I'm all up on it
Up early in the morning
Now that i think about it i was zoning
Cause' i was thinking everytime the phone ring, no answer
Life lessons hit your harder than cancer or dead romances
Nike air maxes and alot fake answers
And all my recent girls on some one night stand shit

(Chorus)
Let's chill
Here til the world goes round
And if you picked me up
Than I will hold you down
But just chill
Girl i ain't went not where
I'm out with my friends and we Chillin'
(We Chillin)
Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da
(We Chillin)
Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da

(verse Sean Auguste)
Body marked up like 49th and Crenshaw
Only reach for big dreams
And women that wear big bras
Big jaws, tatted on my neck
Don't get bit yall
Bitch called, said a nigga hung
Lynch Mob
Sponge bob, cat daddy
In other words bitch I go to work
I dont really work with feelings
Kuz that how you get your feelings hurt
GlassHeart logo on my shirt
Polo shirt underneath
I'd rather wear my heart on my chest than on my sleeve
I'm on my Jordan bitch I'm only 23
On May 5th im on my Kobe still striking from the 3
Reporting live
Shout out to Kris he on the 5
Shout out to T on 48
And shout to Tray off in the A
Hustlin'
All my nigga getting money round here
Roll one up with me
But only if you
Hustlin'
If you really getting money out here
Roll one up with me

(Chorus)
Just chill
Here til the world goes round
And if you picked me up
Than I will hold you down
But just chill
Girl i ain't went not where
I'm out with my friends and we Chillin'
(We Chillin)
Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da
(We Chillin)
Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da

Hustlin'
All my nigga getting money round here
Roll one up with me
But only if you
Hustlin'
If you really getting money out here
Roll one up with me
