[Intro: Christian Bale]
Are we fucking ready?!
Roll cameras! Action!

[Verse 1: Knytro]
Bale on 'em, Christian Bale on 'em
I'm sort of a Dark Knight which you never hear comin'
Calm down Trevor, fuck that, my nigga runnin'
We all goes hard every second on the summit
Public enemies all love it, American hustlers gun for it
You ever had a psycho in your stomach?
Chilling up in you till you take the time to do what he does and
How he does it, dustin' these other runners for what you come with
Salvation of the Terminator
I am the man behind the fire, my sun is my empire
Came straight out of the furnace, check the realest reign of fire
This kid is more than a writer when he sprays saliva

[Hook: KSI & Sway]
What you looking at? Think I'm a madman?
Because the bass got me flapping like Batman
It's early hours and I'm rolling by myself
Though I told her "I'll be back by twelve"

[Bridge 1: KSI, Sway & Both]
They don't wanna let me go, I'm gonna need (bail money)
Tryna keep me in a hole, I'm gonna need (bail money)
Turn it up and let them know, I'm gonna need (bail money)
Gotta get it on the low, don't tell nobody

[Bridge 2: Raptor]
We be creeping in, we be creeping out
Try to lock us up, try to lock us down
We could sneak em in, we could sneak em out
Keep it on the quiet, there's no need to run your mouth

[Verse 2: Sway]
Check it, fee, fi, DCypha
I'm a GI to these ants
Got the opposition revising his plans
[?], breathe
Cause the scene seemed dead for a minute
Whenever Derek goes missing, I'm back
With a bang, back with the gang
Bredda, stand back or end up in the back of the van
I ain't talking about police when I say I need bail money
I'm talking bout Christian, hands up, that's just the [?], honey
Somebody-body-body locked, I'll pick em
Say "welcome to Yale, buddy"
I'm putting in work, [?]
Fe-fi-fo-fum, I smell money

[Verse 3: Raptor]
Can't cat nap in a rat trap full of mishap
Feeling like Indiana Jones
If he was a black bloke and he got a boner
From the word go, dreams of the Merlot
And a fur coat, no negotiations, I don't
Plan to circle around all my problems, game over
Ride through all of them, right ho
Lowkey, closed [?] on the whole scene till the nose bleed
Shall I proceed when I get the proceeds?
Oddly I'm godly, all the rest are a sham of a mockery
Like Christian Bale, so I never let a jail bird flock me
Tryna be the better man
Kill a hook like Never-Neverland
Rap to Roxanne

[Bridge 1: KSI & Sway]
They don't wanna let me go, I'm gonna need (bail money)
Tryna keep me in a hole, I'm gonna need (bail money)
Turn it up and let them know, I'm gonna need (bail money)
Gotta get it on the low, don't tell nobody

[Bridge 2: Raptor]
We be creeping in, we be creeping out
Try to lock us up, try to lock us down
We could sneak em in, we could sneak em out
Keep it on the quiet, there's no need to run your mouth

[Verse 4: Casey Veggies]
Real shit, no act, bitch check my stats
Young Veggie never had a problem, hitting it from the back
This beat come on, and it's time to have a rave
Black girls ass bounce, white girls get laid
I'm just the type of nigga that get paid and say
Get paid and say, me and her vacate
Somewhere that's not around, that's outside LA
LAX to JFK we get to it like anything

[Hook: KSI & Sway]
What you looking at? Think I'm a madman?
Because the bass got me flapping like Batman
It's early hours and I'm rolling by myself
Though I told her "I'll be back by twelve"

[Bridge 1: KSI & Sway]
They don't wanna let me go, I'm gonna need (bail money)
Tryna keep me in a hole, I'm gonna need (bail money)
Turn it up and let them know, I'm gonna need (bail money)
Gotta get it on the low, don't tell nobody

[Bridge 2: Raptor]
We be creeping in, we be creeping out
Try to lock us up, try to lock us down
We could sneak em in, we could sneak em out
Keep it on the quiet, there's no need to run your mouth
