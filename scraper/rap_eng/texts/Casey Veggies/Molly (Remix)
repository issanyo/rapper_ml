[Intro]
That’s where you find me
My friends call me molly
That’s where you find me

[Hook]
Pull up to the club, VIP that’s where you find me
My friends call me molly, I just want a party
Pull up to the club, VIP that’s where you find me
My friends call me molly, I just want a party
I just, I just wanna party, I just wanna party
My friends call me molly, I just want a party

[Verse 1: Reese]
Hey, I’m fresh up out the runway been long day
Trust by running numbers that’s the road race
I’m stretching out this money that’s some long cake
I’m turnt up at your function 50 deep the strong way
You ain’t gotta ask about me nigga
You see me on my shit, thick chick but her waste tiny
And she be on my tip nigga
Two 9 run this shit, you off deck like ??
Lil' shawty' off the molly, pop three more and chug this beer
She keep about them things, she don’t love me she love fame
They on jock like varsity, so your hoes know the name
Nigga still big bank take little bank, you roll weak you cheapskate
She bust it open for a young nigga, while I'm posted playing 2k nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Her dome game got extras
I’m just keeping it player man
Young veggies be flexing, I’m Burberry and Bathing Ape
Sometimes I be chilling but I always got crazy days
Bad hoes that stay tonight, cause they just trying to find a way
I put a chick on a track make her spit bars
19 and my first whip a foreign car
Mama want that work but she better get on her job
It's a stick up in that bitch that pussy getting robbed
The epitome of a real nigga, so a privilege for you to chill with us
Fuck around them fuck arounds, and somebody's gonna deal with you,
I’m faded it off that earth, peas and carrots on my shirt
Every beat get bodied, every snitch nigga get murked

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Robb Bank$]
Bitch, bitch I rep FLA
That mean fuck where he at, that mean fuck what he stay
When I walk away I love the sound of my name
No pussy look me in the face
Straight like that so I ate your bitch from the back (Ratchet!)
Girl paler than a cookie, my wrist looking like that wet pussy
Tussionex look a piss test, one of these nigga's failed and
She look almost perfect with that 18 up her tail
But you don't wanna see a Broward nigga, start to get shit off of his chest
We mix the clean sprite with germs, and I ain’t lying to you
If I propose to your bitch she slide on the ring like a ref
And a nigga got bands like high school, bitch
I sleep good sheets in bed with red bitches complexion like she embarrassed
And by the way, that’s all past tense
Random disclaimer for all of the crackers funky to me
I ride like swine, flew all over the country

[Hook]
