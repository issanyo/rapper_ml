[Intro: Josh Peas]
Swag, swag, swag, what's really wavy, man?
It's Josh Peas, ain't shit funny
I'm here with my young boy Casey Veggies
Been shittin' on you niggas since '06, they know, they know
And I just want y'all to, close your eyes, take a deep breath
And appreciate this real nigga shit, Peas and Carrots, Carrots and Veggies
Wave, swag, chop!

[Hook]
Ridin' roun' town, mo' change, mo' steelo
New girl with me, but I keep it on the d'lo
All these things goin' down, what you think she with me for?
Look like she from Rio, sweeter than Tampico

[Verse 1]
Youngin' on my fly shit, fresher than a peacoat
Grew up nice, so when I sit back and write
I touch my life and every single thing I think of at night
Mind was in the dark, had to reach and switch on the lights
Diggin' deeper, tryna figure whats right
Shit be cuttin' like knifes, but I just try to numb it with life
I'm, ridin' roun town, mo' change, mo' steelo
New girl with me, but I keep it on the d'lo
It's a lot of things goin' down, what you think she with me for?
Spread out bigger, got my people on the East Coast
Cook it up, for the bucks, what you tryna be for?
Model for the kids, man, that's why I keep my sneaks low

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm a cocky young nigga, but I know when to cut it out
Your girl amused by me, when she talk, she got stutter-mouth
Ridin' roun town, mo' change, mo' steelo
Never been to NY, but I'm 'bout to pay the fee though
Then hit ATL, rockin' sales far as we know
Press play grind, no TiVo, that's the G code
Kickin' with friends will get yo ass no ends
And she gone regret I pass, when I pull up in a Benz
I'm just wiping off my lens, I don't see these niggas
Made a promise to myself, "I won't be these niggas."
Girl, you don't know if I hit it! You ain't seen me wit her!
Young boy, so cold, I'll let you see me get her
These girls see me on MTV, nigga
She throw it at me, went ahead and caught the TD with her
Itâ€™s all about what you earn not what the feebies get ya
Don't say LA, without CV in it, feel it?

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Ahh man, we ridin' roun' town, top down
Dreamin' big, nigga, Peas and Carrots

[Verse 3]
Four doors, girls goin' loco
Over Four Loko, we was poppin' that night
Shoutout my nigga KY, she was droppin' that right
Me and the homies be shaded up, with yo girl out of sight
Made a right on Hill St., comin' off La Cieniga
My girl ridin' with me, like she my manager
Like she got plans for us, but I just got plans to bust
Niggas think I'm runnin' out, but I stay gassed up
Blew my shit up, from the ground like NASA
This for everybody roun' town with they cash up
This for all the girls, and bitches, Louis-bagged up
Pray it all go down, happily ever after
