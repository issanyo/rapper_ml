[Verse 1: D-WHY]
They say that life can be a bitch, so can my main chick
She always keeps it real, ironic that she got fake tits
She like my style, she love the hair, said I remind her of Johnny Cash
D, you be killin' 'em everyday, you should start wearing more black
I'm showin' up, I'm showin' off, she showin' out, I showed her how
I showed her in, I showed her down, now I gotta show her how to slow it down
Got a little purse, got a little dog, got a little attitude, a nice fashion sense
I had to put her in timeout...cause she the baddest bitch
My coffee black, my chick white, that coupe red, that light green
My haters blue, that purple stuff, her pink lips, that brown drink
I let 'em know, then let 'em go, got a weakness for them yellow bones
And if she like her white boys, tell Rihanna please hit up my phone
Y'all can't compete with a young motherfucker
Shout out to your moms, I'm a young motherfucker
A wise man told me, "gotta fake it 'til you make it"
I'm a do like Makavelli, I'm a make it 'til I fake it

[Hook: D-WHY]
Kill me now, I'm so fresh I could die
Hope you feel me now, dressing good, living right
Bury me alive, cause my outfit's suicide
I'm so fresh I could die, man I put that on my life
Kill me now, kill me now, honestly I can't take it
Kill me now, kill me now, it's gon' make me more famous
Kill me now, kill me now, shout out the people that I came with
You should see their faces, look momma I made it, kill me now

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Young ho killa', rockin' chinchilla, swag worth a milli, run the whole city
Built it from the ground, find your sound, cause I got mine and this shit's so fly
I don't even know how I get so high, I'm on my grind and I just rolled by
Geeked up, in the discrete truck, and the trees tucked and my seat up
My feet up, I'm too good, I'm Hollywood, but I'm too hood
She molly wood and she staying up, I'm pulling up and I'm paying up
Walk in the store and ain't saying much, don't talk to her if she playing up
I drop her off at the metro bus, and beat it up like a metronome
In a special zone that won't break, like a special homie that won't hate
She feel me now, you can kill me now, when I was younger I was a special child
Now I'm older and I'm bolder, and I put her to sleep like potions
And I wake her up like Folgers, and we sailing out to the oceans
And I swim good, I win good, I lose some, but I fake none
She in a two-door with that loud bumpin' that Veggies in her system
Damn, yea, yea that man, come through like damn
Yea, I do my thing like damn, man

[Hook]

[Verse 3: D-WHY]
Riding in that Beamer, thinking this could be my last trip
Feelin' like I'm Pac, except my Suge is a bad bitch
No Death Row, just kill me, no I.O.U.'s, just bill me now
I been around, you was around, I'm still around, you feel me now
Oh man ain't that life, ain't that nice, ain't that right, oh man, ain't you left, behind
I'm a go 'til my death, real hood like I'm from the projects
Get it how you live, I'm a Hot Boy, on top boy, God bless you
Acting real Juvenile, asking, "what would Mannie Fresh do?"
My new bad bitch look exactly like your sister
Met her at a show and she asked me for a picture
Then took off her shirt and asked if I would kiss her
I said, "what about your brother?" She said, "he's a fucking loser"
I'm just killin' 'em, I'm playing shit, my latest shit, my greatest shit
My mixtapes gon' be albums, and my albums gon' be greatest hits
God damn, I'll kneel down, just crown me now and watch me rule
Assassinate the young king and have six bad bitches guard my tomb

[Hook]

[Outro: D-WHY]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Swag, swag, swag, swag
Kill me now, I'm so fresh I could die
Hope you feel me now, dressing good, living right
Bury me alive, cause my outfit's suicide
I'm so fresh I could die, man I put that on my life
