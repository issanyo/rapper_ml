[Intro]
Yeah, Young Veggies
Let's go

[Verse 1]
I want the most nigga, nothing lesser
Like MJ in 4th quarter, I handle the pressure
I'm knee deep in this shit, yeah we some born sinners
It's five seconds left, I had to hit the game winner
We can build something special if we hold it together
I'm done touring, yeah I'm with whatever
The flight's booked in the morning, you just lead the way
I do me, you focus on you and then we'll be okay
Pull up in that white thing, told them hoes that life change
Tryna do the right thing, I'm high off life and Mary Jane
Know that you heard "Life Rhymes," I'm only fucking with bright queens
I appreciate you but stand down through all the fake shit fame brings

[Hook]
Shout out to everybody fucking with me
Shout out to everybody fucking with me
If they hating on me, tell them they can come and get me
Shout out to everybody fucking with me
Shout out to everybody fucking with me
Shout out to everybody fucking with me
East side, West side who fucking with me
Shout out to everybody fucking with me

[Verse 2]
You my nigga dog, I'm here whenever
Can't forget we got here together
At the top we sit together
I'm getting rich, we getting rich together
Hope my young niggas live forever
Make it up to them different levels
Every nigga in your clique is rich then all you niggas be rich forever
Baby girl, she get whatever if she keep her shit together
I might hang up, she might call back
We did all that and still together
We about to kill the whole game
We about to cop them gold chains
We in the hotel going crazy, baby girl take the whole thing
I might rock Puma a year straight
They send that shit to my crib, the gear's great
Young nigga get money in every state
I put game in her ear and let it marinate
I fell asleep in that pussy, I meditate
Concentrate, keep my eyes on the goal, I never wait
Hold up, shout out to everybody fucking with me
Puma life mixed with designer, who fucking with me?
My fans bout to rock that headband all summer with me
I told that girl if she want it she can come and get me
She came faster than Usain Bolt
Your game slow
If she going, whatever I say go

[Hook]

[Bridge]
It's like what you looking for is out there, you gotta find it
Life is simple once you understand how God designed it
I swear sometimes we live in the dark because we blinded
I'm a good person but on the mic I'm criminal minded
It's like what you looking for is out there, you gotta find it
Life is simple once you understand how God designed it
I swear sometimes we live in the dark because we blinded
I'm a good person but on the mic I'm criminal minded

[Hook]
