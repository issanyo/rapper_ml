[Intro: Darnell Williams]
What's a critic to a nigga like me?
What's a critic to a nigga like me?
What's a critic to a nigga like me?
Shoot a fuckin' flick, bitch, I'm young Spike Lee

[Verse 1: Darnell Williams]
It's the feelin' of feelin' so fuckin' sick of the feelin'
The doctor's writin' prescriptions because my mental work different
They think I'm stupid and timid, I say tormented and gifted
I put that weight on my shoulders, most of you hoes couldn't lift it
Where is my bitch and some Swishers? Them two be liftin' my spirits
My mama told me the truth, I was just too high to hear it
F-failure too broke to fear it, Satan been chokin' my spirit
I pray to God when they shootin', I know it's loud, hope he hear it
I'm in the 40s with Crips (what up), on MLK
Nah, I ain't bangin' but I live that shit like every day
I'm that nigga with the frames and the Michigan plates
The one these hoes wanna fuck but this dick ain't free
Bitch, I'm an MVP from the west of the D
Nah, fuck the sugar coatin', bitch, I'm the best of the D
Got a problem, Insta-, Tweet, DM a message to me
I reply every time, aye, nigga fuck what you think, LOL

[Chorus: Darnell Williams]
What's a critic to a nigga like me?
Pull your wifey in a fuckin' white tee
Turn the lights out then I "Do the Right Thing"
Shoot a fuckin' flick, bitch, I'm young Spike Lee
Bitch, I'm young Spike Lee, bitch, I'm young Spike Lee
Bitch, I'm young Spike Lee and my dead stop threes
Turn the lights out then I "Do the Right Thing"
Shoot a fuckin' flick, bitch, I'm young Spike Lee

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Ayy, now get the fuck out your feelings
I give your main chick the business
Make a movie like Spike, I play the roll as a villain
I'm not robbin' or dealin', I got my mind on a million
I ain't worried 'bout the hustle, got my own way to get it
Just landed in L.A., Darnell scooped me in the 6
Ask him, "Who whip is this?" He said, "It's District; Virginia"
Like man, she gave me some chips and now he pourin' up zips
I been outta the country, yeah, just spendin' some currency

[Verse 3: Darnell Williams]
Well I been out in Hollywood, gettin' paid to direct
Smack the shit out a nigga who won't be quiet on set
Ain't no smiles in my town, bitch, I'm as nice as it get
He trade the "Summer of Sam", he kill whoever you with
I wish I could give a fuck but that shit don't pay the rent
Don't really care for you niggas, like the U.S. government
And you know, you goin' broke 'cause you lack common sense
Want 40 acres, keep the mule, I need girl number 6, shit

[Chorus: Darnell Williams]
What's a critic to a nigga like me?
Pull your wifey in a fuckin' white tee
Turn the lights out then I do the right thing
Shoot a fuckin' flick, bitch, I'm young Spike Lee
Bitch, I'm young Spike Lee, bitch, I'm young Spike Lee
Bitch, I'm young Spike Lee and my dead stop threes
Turn the lights out then I do the right thing
Shoot a fuckin' flick, bitch, I'm young Spike Lee
