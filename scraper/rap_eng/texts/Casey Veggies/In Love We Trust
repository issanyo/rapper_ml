[Intro]
Turn me, turn me up
Don't don't turn me down
Don't turn me down, yeah
Turn me, turn me, turn me turn me turn me, turn me, turn me up
Don't turn me down
Turn me up, don't turn me down

[Verse 1: Jhene Aiko]
In the heart of LA, there's a lost little girl
With a head full of curls and the weight of the world on her shoulders
But her story gets colder, hold up
Every man that she's ever encountered have proved to be cowards
Misused and abused her and bruised her with power
Now her doubt's getting louder
And all her tears are building up, building up, building up
And all her fears are killin' her, killin' her, killin' her
She don't believe in love no more, no more, no more
She don't believe in love
But I believe in her
I believe in her
Cause I believe in love
And love believes in us

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
In the streets of NY
There's a guy who's just trying to get by
9 to 5, selling dope on the side
For his son turning one
Money grams every first of the month for his mom
Baby mom's always calling with problems
Plus his brother in Harlem
Just got killed, a drug deal that has gone wrong
With everything that's going on
All his tears are building up, building up, building up
And all his fears are killin' him, killin' him, killin' him
He don't believe in love no more, no more, no more
He don't believe in love
But I believe in him
Yes, I believe in him
And I believe in love
Cause love believes in us

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, she a bad lil' chick focused on good livin'
I chased it bad, rap life trying to find good in it
I had to tell her every city got a hood in it
All the time fine girls got me thinking I would hit it
She assumin' me and him is just the same
But she should realize a real nigga and accept the change
Girl I got separate brains, and they in separate lanes
One is chasing your love, the other never think
I love the fact you filled with knowledge, a freshman in college
With the mindset, love life won't help you prosper
Trying to help you love life, keep you from impostors
Maybe you just wrap money, give you a couple options
Really feel you deserve it, and I don't think that often
I'm just lost in facts, the truth hits
I'm riding round town with my new chick
Old chick on my mental, man this shit is too sick damn

[Outro]
And all our tears are building up, building up, building up
And all our fears are killin' us, killin' us
We don't believe in love no more, no more, no more
We don't believe in love
But love believes in us
Yes, love believes in us
Love believes in us, trust love
Cause love believes in us, trust love
