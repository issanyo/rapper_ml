[Verse 1: Travis Garland]
You're quite an actress
And you're playin' your part to a T
'Cause you's a bad bitch
Don't gotta play the good girl for me

[Pre-Chorus]
So why you doing that for?
Let me show you a couple things that you might not know
Stop and let the thing go
'Cause the feeling that you feel underneath gonna show
Why you tryna play bad?
You know you turn me on when you do me like that
So just go with it
'Cause seeing you in the field, girl, you just might get it

[Chorus]
I be coming over to steal all your time
We can do whatever, babe, yeah
But all she wanna do is
All she wanna do is, yeah
All she wanna do is, you know
That's that shit I'm talking about
That's that shit I'm talking about
That's that shit

[Verse 2: Travis Garland]
If you want to, bring out the whips and chains
I'm down
I know you into that type of freaky things, aren't you, now?

[Pre-Chorus]


[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
I got a whip, though, that's the bid, yo
I'm a freak but I'm so professional
She a freak but she got her eyes open
Know how to be a woman when the eyes on her
I can get any girl at the right time
But you the right girl in this right time
You ain't never met a boy with his shit together
I'm so committed, you can get it whatever
I put my all in this stroke
She do things for me that she don't do at all for you, though
We balling, really I prefer her on, she on it
I got her but I really want more of it
All she wanna do is fuck with the boy
When I put it on she gonna put trust in the boy
It's nothing, what you need, I already got it
My chick so bad, she on that, she already got it


[Chorus]

[Outro]
That's that shit
That's that shit
That's that shit I'm talking about
That's that shit I'm talking about
That's that shit
