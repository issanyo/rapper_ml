(Hook)
I was that nigga back then and I'm still on top
When I had dreams of doing it big, now they real all the time
You been working for a minute and it still won't pop
Dropped my first shit on my own, so I'm never gonna flop

(Verse 1)
My chick super bad, riding super fast
Loaning stupid swag, cloning Cupid mask
Price as new as gas, paying, popping tags
So once he started to pop this shit I drop it off so fast
Million dollar mind, billion dollar grind
Benihana time, Ballade Louis style
Life's a movie now, with all that extra clips
I'm working and she's working
So we just text a bit, we just flex a bit
When she get some time
Swear I love to beat it up
But I really want yo mind, Hold up
Young boy, might have to slow up
Something bout growing up in California
With the nice trees and my life freeze
And the fans recognize me

(Verse 2)
My chick super bad, riding super fast
Lonely stupid swag, cloning Cupid mask
Drop exclusive flows, rock it you suppose
Cropping new designs, profit it in the stores
European shoes with the leather laces
Living with no limits, going hella crazy
Life with no limitations can make you go hella crazy
We be elevating, baby why you infiltrating?
Wanted to be a millionaire, holding on to my life lines
Hoping I can make a call, get some advice when the time is right
Baby girl, your mind right, you can do something different then them other types
I ain't willing to tell no lies, I'm just willing to tell them out

(Hook) x2

(Verse 3)
My chick super bad, riding super fast
Lonely stupid swag, clowning Cupid mask
Drop exclusive flows, roll your juicy rolls
Popping new designs, profit it in the stores
My chick super bad, riding stupid fast
Getting hella gold, getting hella shows
Getting hella dough, got her hella faded
Momma hella bad, so I penetrate her
Why she infiltrating? We be renovating
Copping new shit, people hella mad
Why they infiltrating? You be instigating
I'm far along the road, seeing hella faces, hella faces

(Outro)
Seeing hella faces, hella faces
Seeing hella faces, hella faces
Seeing hella faces, hella faces

Ah man..
