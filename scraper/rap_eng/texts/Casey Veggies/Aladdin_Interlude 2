[Intro]
Let's get all the money
Let's get it all
Right now
You gotta be a genie out here

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Floating thru the streets like Aladdin
Got young freaks on my mattress
If that girl with me she the baddest
If he go against me he the saddest

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
All these girls fucking for the status
I see the game for what it is you see it backwards
I run thru that girl first you get her after
Imma real nigga, girl I ain't no rapper
Or really I'm tryna say I ain't like these rappers
Just know that shit you putting out it come back at ya
Got a small college chick, we put that dough together
If she eating veggies, she gon live forever
I'm floating thru the streets like Aladdin
I don't see nobody I think I need glasses
Different whips like them slave masters
Nigga try to hang me I'mma bash em, I'mma bash em

[Hook: Casey Veggies 2x]

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Aight, these niggas look at me like "How it happen?"
He started free but now the nigga out here taxing
I bought another Jesus piece to show my passion
You think I'm popping now wait till I drop the Jasmine
So many stacks on me it got my pants saggin'
I do the Audi let my momma pull the Jag in
And truth be told I ain't really with the braggin'
I just remember so it's like I'm re-enacting
They yappin, they talking for reaction
I'm laughing, while I'm bringing all this cash in
Right now, higher then I ever been
A couple blunts and good head a nigga medicine
Twenty stacks, hundred racks, how I bring it back
Quarter-back throw a sack, now she in the sack
And we do dinner and a movie if she into that
And if you see us you will know and you remember that

[Hook]
