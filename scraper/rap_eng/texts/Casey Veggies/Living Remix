I said it's Rockie checking in
You know I'm going for the win (LP what up)

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
I said what is Rockie doing, ya'll people shouldn't try it
It's only one I like a pirate
And I ain't even tripping 'bout the music people pirate
Cause I know when I drop my shit everybody gon' buy it
Why? Because they like it, yup, yup, they love it, they admire it
Wish a nigga would so I'd have more to start my fire with
Never trust these hoes, cause they try to put me out
Going on what they assuming
Don't know what they talking 'bout
But through it all, I still get labeled as the hot shit
Discussions, I'm the topic, draft, I'll be the top pick
They love the way I rock it, pieces to my quarry
Everybody want me booked, so I guess they feel my story
I be on top shortly, I'm busy making moves
And the only time I fail, is when I fail to lose
And the time and the money is the thing I've been giving
And now, the finer things are what I'm getting so...

[Hook]
This is the life that we living
Good drinks, good weed, good women
I'm on my shit
And I'm a live my whole life like this [x2]
So get your hand up, get 'em high
Get your drinks up, to the sky
I'm on my shit
And I'm a live my whole life like this [x2]

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
What your life like, Man I write like
The drink throw some ice
I only wife her if she right
I tell 'em bite the check and that's for doing what I like
Or is it a dream? Cause it can't be life!
Ain't got a fear of flying, take me where I desire
Real life no lyin', Young Veggies with the limin
My chick fall in love, niggas call me Frankie Lymon
And i'm about to blow up, I'm only taking dimes in
Thinking back to a couple different times when
She ain't give me a chance, but now she all up on me
But I don't care, that's life, I guess I still want it
My whole shit turned in, and now I'm all up on shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tayyib Ali]
They don't understand, It's visionary man
I'm sticking to the plan, whole world in my hand
Got a dollar and a goal, and I finna make
Big crib, Real estate, 10 to 8
I'm grinding, putting that time in, they vibing
Spit that hot shit, lyrical problem
I ride with a guy that's top down we styling
It's all gravy when them ladies want to be mine
Same kid know where to go when I rewind, back in time
I'm bad Micheal Jackson, crack with rhymes
Yeah, Philly where I'm living, It's trap or die
Going hard till I'm up in that casket right
So I see you in the afterlife
I, remember when, the bus got started from kid again
And niggas was tripping man
They was like: "Tayyib just dropped!" "Oh really man?"
It's so word to feel it man
I'm meant for the killing man
I'm spinning like ceiling fans

[Hook]
