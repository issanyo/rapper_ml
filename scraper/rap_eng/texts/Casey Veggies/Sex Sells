Sex sells, get the best deal
Swear I probably come and buy it all retail
Swipe that credit card, might as well
I got that vision if it's working, I know I can tell
Aw man, not for ten, hundred grand, freshest in the land
Get that money, grind it up, tell me what's the plan
International travel, the passport with the stamps

[Verse 1]
Black hoodie, black jeans, I'm in my night fit
She knew I was headed to take it down like she psychic
I don't know which way to go, she told me keep driving
In that new A5 with the [?] vibing
I'm so zoned out man and she wilding
We two different people but she so on it
[?] had to do it again in the morning
First I stack my cheese up then I get horny
Grind come first, baby girl I'm back shortly
Knew you probably wish that I was taking college courses
Right with you though, but I'm living on Pluto
But I can be your lifeguard, I swim in that pool though
Home run the money, til my angel out in Pujols
Lil mama think she got something to prove though
Think she a star cause she been up in the videos
But she a star cause she move around

[Verse 2]
All my niggas hit it and all my niggas winning
Speak the truth, if it wasn't then I wouldn't spit it
So you saying without this money girl I couldn't get it
Probably open up your budget if you just admit it
That if I throw 10 stacks, you go 150
That's too hard you wild as a zoo yard
Young rap success story, you knew I would make it big
Ain't no need to say this shit, you never going too far
Already know it, always show it
If she ask for that cash, always blow it
Told my momma one day, she ain't gotta work
Told my cousin one day, he ain't gotta serve
Sex sells, shirt off on stage boy I got some nerve
She'll go down and I won't say one word
I won't stress you though, the worst is prolly let you go
But you could have it all if you do that shit professional

Get that money, grind it up, tell me what's the plan
International travel, the passport with the stamps
