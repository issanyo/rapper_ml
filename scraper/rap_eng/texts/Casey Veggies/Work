[Intro: Nate Poetics]
She knew exactly who I was becoming
Reality of dreams, younger for memories of a still wonder of who I might be
And for her it’s hard to stomach what’s left behind
And what’s to come in the same introduction of a king
Just know everything coming can only give birth to the principle
That by any means I produce wings like eagles
Soar in the highest clouds to let my conscience free
So I can feed ex-girls like sea gulls with bitter egos
And out work Wale's ambitious girls with the tip of my penis
To write stories, a young poetic genius
And I mean this, there’s never been a day off
Never been laid off, my own boss and my payoff is to get laid off
Get a break off just to re-hire myself
For the take off Beach House the EP

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla Sign]
These hoes all tryna come back and make it work, make it work
I tell these hoes come get this work, get this work
I give no fucks, I give no damn
I took my bitch straight from her man, from her man
That nigga ain’t had much money as I do
That nigga don’t know your body like I do
Your friends think I ain’t shit, I don’t like them either
Them hoes ain’t shit, they can’t keep no man either
Ain’t believing me then but you see me now
Said you’d never trust me again but you believe me now
And now somehow we supposed to fix ya

[Hook]
These hoes all tryna come back and make it work, make it work
These hoes all tryna come back and make it work, make it work
I tell these hoes come get this work, get this work
I tell these hoes come get this work, get this work
These hoes all tryna come back and make it work, make it work
These hoes all tryna come back and make it work, make it work
I tell these hoes come get this work, get this work
I tell these hoes come get this work, get this work

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Baby girl she 100 my mind right, that’s real stuntin
She in the crowd tryna fly it for me
I fucked around and then went for it
I love that girl so much
I fucked around and paid the rent for her
Feel like I’m the right pimp for her
But we got enough, she ain’t gotta work
I give it to er, I got it first
She right here, I ain’t gotta search
We in a party…
We in a party, I’m amused by how you move yo body
Baby girl she more poppin in the 12 gauge shotty
She got 4 shots, we goin up, I don’t need no molly
These hoes fuck with the squad, she ran through the whole posse
Girl I think about you when I’m in that hotel lobby
I’m coming home to you, yea I got work for yo body

[Hook]
These hoes all tryna come back and make it work, make it work
These hoes all tryna come back and make it work, make it work
I tell these hoes come get this work, get this work
I tell these hoes come get this work, get this work
These hoes all tryna come back and make it work, make it work
These hoes all tryna come back and make it work, make it work
I tell these hoes come get this work, get this work
I tell these hoes come get this work, get this work

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
I’m gonna work on it
You gon get this work, girl

You gon make it clap with no hands
When her ass down, goddamn
You gon get this work girl
Oh oh oh
(You gon get this work girl)
I’mma throw these bands
You gon make it clap with no hands
When her ass down, damn

[Hook]
These hoes all tryna come back and make it work, make it work
These hoes all tryna come back and make it work, make it work

[Bridge]
I used to love these hoes
I used to love these hoes
I used to love these hoes
But now I love this money
I used to love these hoes
I used to love these hoes
But now I love this money
I used to love these hoes

[Verse 4: Twista]
Hoes, I used to have a lot of kind
But when they realize that I gotta grind
I replaced the lies and the thighs and the hotter dimes
With the fuckin rhymes and the ties and the dolla signs
The symbol of the Caduceus
I full want my mental producers
I’m leaving these haters clueless
When I spit because they missin what I get because I’m cold
Real niggas listen to the shit that I unfold
I cannot believe that whether they used to be lovin these hoes
Now that I be on my money, it’s funny the way that I govern these hoes
And I be runnin these hoes, doin whatever I wanna do with em
As long as I be on my paper, cus I’m gon let nothing in front of me after my currency flow
And if we getting the fetty so up
But I throw it away but the bitches don’t want
If they talk about me
Your position to fall will be nothing
I’m done wit yo frontin, just give me yo dollars, I don’t wanna holler
I don’t want yo woman, I want the Apollo
But see for the Benjamins I got my shotta
And Twista love dollars but I admit

[Bridge]
I used to love these hoes
But now I love this money
I used to love these hoes
I used to love these hoes
But now I love this money
I used to love these hoes
