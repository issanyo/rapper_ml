[Intro]
Said you wanna go?
Where to?
I mean we can but...i don't know

[Hook: Casey]
She said she wanna go
She said she wanna leave
I said I do too baby where you wanna be?
She said with me wherever I go
I'm just what she need but she know how I do
She know I write songs but are they for her
She know I stay down but will it occur
I don't know oooo but I know that we can go oooo

[Verse 1: Hodgy]
You picked me thinking I was your best guy
Gave you the best slice from my best pie
I even let you shop at best buy, itunes
Won't you cop my song
Leave me alone I'm in my zone
But I got this chick on the other line on my phone
Damn she's all on my dome givin me dome
And most of them showin unknown
Cums on the call then you pick up the phone
I left my phone at home and you copped it picked it up then you dropped it
Then she said wsup you said wsup you said what the what the fuck
And I was just starin tryna get home racin in my mclaren
Lookin at aaron starin
People don't know but you say it ain't fair and I agree

[Hook: Casey]

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
I go to the house
You sit on the couch
Take my shit off the couch
She tried to kick me out my house
Her ring fall off I'm picking up the spouse
Listen to the girl shit I'm picking up my mouth
Jaw dropping she dropped my jaw
Now I'm picking up what else is in my pocket
Wallet fell out she sat me on my ass
I'm sittin on the grass smokin on the grass
Chillin with that ass that was yesterday
I mean we used to play
And now it's time for divorce relationship decayed
I could spit that break hearts like tick tacs
Still get back I meant to say kit kat

[Hook: Casey]

[Verse 3: Casey]
Girl you know I love you
You know you are the hood
I ain't tryna read but it's one for the books
I'm really feelin your looks but it's also what's on the inside
You wanna come with me you because you wanna win right
I'm giving you insight cause it don't sit here right
Our love is in the dark but baby the lens like

But this bout to end like
