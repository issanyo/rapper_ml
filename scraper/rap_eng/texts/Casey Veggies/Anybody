[Verse 1]
I’m ‘bout to be here forever
I’m not no facade or a fad
Your girlfriend is missin', don’t trip
She just chillin' somewhere in my pad
CV in the building
I’m makin' a killin', I fill up the bag
I look in the mirror
It couldn’t be clearer, the boy got that swag
Biggie Smalls, nigga, now gimme the loot
Feelin' like Pac in 92', cause they tellin' me I got the juice
When I’m in the booth
I'ma be livin' proof, I’m the voice to the youth
They don’t got a clue
How I’m stayin' the same but everything new
Shout out to the baby momma’s payin' rent
Like I gotta get it, yeah, I gotta get it, yeah, I gotta get it
I’m wakin' up early in the mornin'
I started from sleepin' in class
My teacher didn’t think I would be shit
I guess I ain’t doin' that bad

[Hook]
Young and rich off rap, I’m not just anybody
My new chick stacked, my old girl ain't got anybody
She bought my shit, man she don't fuck with anybody
I love my squad, I put them over anybody
Anybody, anybody
This my year, no I don't hear anybody
Anybody, anybody
I'm right here, no I don't fear anybody

[Verse 2]
I'm so raw, I'm so street
I never talk to police
Young niggas, we so deep
This victory feels so sweet
I'm stand down with both feet
Ridin' 'round my hood with Bo Peep
She fly as Angela Jolie
Gave me head, feel like she had no teeth
Payin' dues with a blank check
Cause my dough up, it's a cake fest
Won't take a loss but I take respect
Hit my goals in life cause I ace the test
I bury haters, carry stress
But I'm very thankful, very blessed
If I ain't the best, nigga wage a bet
And be ready when I come collect

[Hook]
Young and rich off rap, I’m not just anybody
My new chick stacked, my old girl ain't got anybody
She bought my shit, man she don't fuck with anybody
I love my squad, I put them over anybody
Anybody, anybody
This my year, no I don't hear anybody
Anybody, anybody
I'm right here, no I don't fear anybody

[Bridge]
One time for my girls that's really ridin'
Yeah she fuck with me and not just anybody
Stevie Wonder, I don't see anybody
I had to tell myself I'm not just anybody
Anybody, anybody
I had to tell myself I'm not just anybody
Anybody, anybody
I had to tell myself I'm not just anybody

[Hook]
Young and rich off rap, I’m not just anybody
My new chick stacked, my old girl ain't got anybody
She bought my shit, man she don't fuck with anybody
I love my squad, I put them over anybody
Anybody, anybody
This my year, no I don't hear anybody
Anybody, anybody
I'm right here, no I don't fear anybody
