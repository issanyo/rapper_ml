[Intro: Casey Veggies]
Yeah
What you looking at [?]
I know you don't want that
Story of my life
Customized Greatly
Casey Veggies

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
If I could start from scratch
I'd probably wait a few more seconds before I cross the street
Dudes I thought was my friends double crossing me
Me against the world is what it ought to be, ought to be
But before this music myself was the motivation
And I realize that was the dream everybody was chasing
Stage name Veggies, everybody could taste it
And he loves everybody who hates him
But any age or size, you couldn't take it
So I sit back and wrote rhymes for amazement
And did you write that? That's amazing
Customized Greatly the mixtape is what they craving
As i sit back on the ground just laying, just praying
[?] I hope you feel what I'm saying
But, but, but
But if you don't want me here, I'm still staying

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
And I never leave
A weak link is what I'll never be
A lot of rappers but I wasn't playing them
They said I was weak cause I wasn't the same as them
So it's my music, forget the rest
My enemies stay close, I never send friend requests
And naw, this is not an example, not a test
Because out of most of these MCs, I'm the best
It's what I want, none of y'all gon' take it
And if they only picking one, none of y'all gon' make it
My mind's here but my heart is so vacant
It's a lot of rappers but no Casey
It's a lot of men but most babies
I work hard, I'm so lazy
I'm so sane but I'm so crazy
So if you could start your life from scatch, you couldn't change that

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back
