You thought i was wasn't coming back?
We coming back harder than ever, harder than ever
(No pressure)

[Chorus]
They're stealin' swag, yeah they're tryna run with that (tryna run with that)
Expensive taste, baby I can't fuck with that (can't fuck with that)
Put the team on my back and run it back (run it back)
I call the play, you fuckin' with the quarterback (the quarteback)
Stealin' swag and they're tryna run with that (tryna run with that)
Expensive taste, baby I can't fuck with that (can't fuck with that)
Put the team on my back and run it back (run it back)
I call the play, you fuckin' with the quarterback (the quarteback)

[Verse]
Quarterback for my team, we 'bout to cash out
Ghost, I pull up foreign and we smash out
Road trip to Vegas on a cash route (cash route)
Grindin' super hard and I can't tap out (I can't tap out)
I go get the bag, securin' it fast, make sure that I got it
My niggas they pass it, they flip all the work and fuck up the product
My bitch is siddy but that ass is fat like she came from the project
I tinted the windows 'cause really it's too many people that's watchin' (yeah)
Been winnin' so long, they see you shinin' and act like it's wrong (act like it's wrong)
I'm caught up in that game, baby was still holdin' on (still holdin' on)
You switch up on me when I was down, when I'm up, nigga don't hit my phone (don't hit my phone)
You switch up on me when I was down, when I'm up, baby don't hit my phone

[Chorus]
Stealin' swag and they're tryna run with that (tryna run with that)
Expensive taste, baby I can't fuck with that (can't fuck with that)
Put the team on my back and run it back (run it back)
I call the play, you fuckin' with the quarterback (the quarteback)
Stealin' swag and they're tryna run with that (tryna run with that)
Expensive taste, baby I can't fuck with that (can't fuck with that)
Put the team on my back and run it back (run it back)
I call the play, you fuckin' with the quarterback (the quarteback)
Stealin' swag and they're tryna run with that (tryna run with that)
Expensive taste, baby I can't fuck with that (can't fuck with that)
Put the team on my back and run it back (run it back)
I call the play, you fuckin' with the quarterback (the quarteback)
