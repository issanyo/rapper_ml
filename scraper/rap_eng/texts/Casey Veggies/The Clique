[Hook x2: Sir Michael Rocks (Tris J)]
It’s like what’s that? Hold up
Cellphone, swolled up
Herring bones with gold cuts, got money bags for both nuts
Come fuck with the clique (Come fuck with the clique)
Come fuck with the clique (Come fuck with the clique)
Come fuck with the clique (Come fuck with the clique)
Come fuck with the clique

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
It’s Young Veggies
My plans right my funds ready
I say my name, she can take that in
Never forget it, it’s engraved in her brain
Bend it over, back it up
That cool kid put it in the bag
I ride flows and revive hoes
Dream big, my mind blown
Fuck with the clique this rap shit a lick
All my niggas on girl gon' take your pick
Every time they come through they always takin’ pics
Like hold up, we can do that later
I realized and I thought about it
Like why even rap about your haters?
I love y’all, I trust y’all
I’ll probly never get enough y’all
I came here, my chucks on
That west side connection
I shine hard, you know this
Put time in, I’m focused
Girl you can get it by the ocean
So smooth in these Pro Tools
Life like photo shoots
I know you see me doing my thing

[Verse 2: Tris J]
I bust a P down, slang motherfucker, slang
I got your girl givin’ me brain on cocaine
I chef the gas salad, dressing propane
A little baby greens mixed with romaine
I’m feelin’ gnarly in these Cartis with the wooden frames
Michael got the buffies, know that he probly feelin’ the same
Pretty glasses see pretty asses, hoes flock in pretty masses
Niggas tryin’ to be like Tris, need to pay for these 3D glasses
Can’t swerve in my lane though, 'less you into crashes
Cost for you to swag here and you know we taxin’
Mobbin’ with the clique, got your bitch lookin’ sick
I’m a silky ass player with some pimpin’ ass spit

It’s like what’s that? Hold up

Come fuck with the clique (Come fuck with the clique)
Come fuck with the clique (Come fuck with the clique)
Come fuck with the clique (Come fuck with the clique)
Come fuck with the clique

[Verse 3: Sir Michael Rocks]
I'm ‘bout that bust that paper down
You already know my favorite sound
And they tried to stop me on some label shit
But now I’m more swank - more paid
This lame ass nigga try to throw shade
Back then you could’ve been so paid
I’m flyin’ by in that Porsche
A ounce of dope in that North Face
My ex girls, we missin’ them
Like Shorty K and them court dates
I’m on the move, love my fam
I’m uncle Luke, fuck Uncle Sam
I’m glad to see my vision grow better than the original
This molly got me trippin’ mane
Everything just went digital
Tryin’ to put you on my team, bitch
Seein’ you pass the physical
I want it, I see it, I need it, I gain it
And all of it happened
This is the team, if you tryna get cream
You should probly follow the captain
