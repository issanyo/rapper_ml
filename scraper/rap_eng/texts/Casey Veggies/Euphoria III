[Verse 1:Casey Veggies]
Oh lord, got my hands crossed somebody save me
From all these chicks with their pants off I'm going crazy
Where that old school Vandross? We in need
Tell her take it slow so she won't be another ho
I can't tiptoe, coming late in bungalow
Graduated school now I am heading down another route
Fresh rap got me far but niggas set traps
Trying to tackle me from the stars but watch me get back
We did that shit on our own ain't have no dispatch
City on my shoulders and I'm working on my six pack
Never got jacked knock on wood, cause thats what goes down in the hood
Going all around the world, but never leaving for good
She was riding me heavy
Going real hard trying to cut, my girl said she ain't ready
Told her don't lose my trust cause she my favorite
And she know I'm the best man, Young Taye Diggs

So much smoke need oxygen
Steadily count them Benjamin's
So much smoke need oxygen
Steadily count them Benjamin's
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
So much smoke need oxygen
Steadily count them Benjamin's
So much smoke need oxygen
Steadily count them Benjamin's
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Look at all the bullshit I've been through

[Verse 2:Casey Veggies]
The youngin' jam smashing never on the bandwagon
Pull up on that mad fashion but I got my pants saggy
Anything you want in life you got to start slow
Realize, game proceeded to play my part though
Street gave me bad taste with no more ortho
Grandma past away, like where my heart go
Do you hear me screaming I just let the pen bleed slow
At 13 was spitting my story its all on TiVo
High off life need oxygen, can't nobody stop me now
The girls took them greyhounds ? mean she bust it down
Going hard off nitro, I count cheese, fight foes
That say what up when I ride around but hate me when I'm gone
Niggas ask for my studio I reply in my zone
She used to only call my phone now she spend the night in my home
Things build and shit grows, we won't do nothing but get old
Drive fast, don't bypass, just count cash, and stay gold
