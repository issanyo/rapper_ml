I found love and I stopped loving
Found God when I stopped looking for one
Found a life but can’t make a living
Don’t wanna find the end so I’m still in it
Still lost, still here
No past, don’t care about looking back anyway
Nothing matters anyway
‘Cause I’m still lost, still here
No past, don’t care about looking back anyway
If I’m moving on it anyway

Damn
Yeah

Been in this drought watch me bounce back
I see your cheese that's a mouse trap
Since I ain't about that
Take longer on my route
But the payout is a mountain
We built this from the ground up
I heard Jesus was is carpentry
Then I think about the crucifix
The ones I'm tryna save keep crossing me
Whoo
Shout out to MacDre
Shoutout to me nigga
We still paying and praying
Don't act like we achieve something
But it's something bout the last name
Make it feel like winner season
Get numbers for A and the Z
And let they Momma split it up between them

No path, I’m still lost
Still here
No path, I’m still lost
Still here

Have a new attitude about things
You can do an about face 
And since you about about Nathan(nothing)
Kristine Leahy just stay in your lane
How you a critic and ain’t never Ball
You ain’t seen nothing like this one before
I might just have another son
Cause I’m really fucking with Lavar
Shout out to Mad Gregg
I’m still me nigga
To a fault but I ain't never changed
Lets have a function on the 3 nigga

(Changes)
No path, I’m still lost
Still here
No path, I’m still lost
Still here
