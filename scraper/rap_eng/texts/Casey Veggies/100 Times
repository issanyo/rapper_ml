[Intro]
Yeah, uh

[Chorus]
Yeah, I can do this shit 100 times
Love the grind, they slept on me, now the summer's mine
Uh, make a bad chick wait in line
Yeah, I got sidetracked, now it's my time
Uh, I can do this shit 100 times
Feel like Weezy F. 'cause Baby's money on my mind
I love the grind, you gotta put in work to shine
All them bands make her dance, she gon' fall in line

[Verse 1]
Uh, I heard you speaking on the king, what you mean
I make a player split it with the team by any means
Smoking mid this shit ain't what it seems or what you think
Wu-Tang Clan young niggas get the cream, get the cream
Shorty pulled up on me then she take her clothes off
She said I go hard and her last nigga so soft
All this pressure on me something to take the load off
I ain't nothing like these niggas, I can't fold up
Shorty chose up, I'm like baby hold up
Yeah, few shots of that .42 and she gon' go up
Yeah, looking out a penthouse view, I'm smokin', po' it up
Yeah, ooking at the game we bout to have it [?] up

[Chorus]
Yeah, I can do this shit 100 times
Love the grind, they slept on me, now the summer's mine
Uh, make a bad chick wait in line
Yeah, I got sidetracked, now it's my time
Uh, I can do this shit 100 times
Feel like Weezy F. 'cause Baby's money on my mind
I love the grind, you gotta put in work to shine
All them bands make her dance, she gon' fall in line

[Verse 2]
Real shit all in my quotes, you just sit and rhyme
We selling candy by the pound, I ain't flip no dime
I was tryna look at life from a different side
My momma dropped me at the lab, I can't waste no time
Yeah, I'm grinding hard, she wanna wine and dine
Yeah, my chick super bad and she super fine
Running laps 'round these niggas, I can't let up none
In the trap with the team going on a run
Uh, that money counter, yeah it's never done
I put in overtime, that guarantee the bread'll come
Leave the guns, we party and we having fun
It's too many hoes for niggas tryna fight for none
Uh, to be the boss you gotta spend the funds
I had to take a couple losses then went number one
Yeah, we kept on going 'til we got it done
That's on my name, all that pain made me 1 and 1

[Chorus]
Yeah, I can do this shit 100 times
Love the grind, they slept on me, now the summer's mine
Uh, make a bad chick wait in line
Yeah, I got sidetracked, now it's my time
Uh, I can do this shit 100 times
Feel like Weezy F. 'cause Baby's money on my mind
I love the grind, you gotta put in work to shine
All them bands make her dance, she gon' fall in line

[Outro]
Aw man, aw man
