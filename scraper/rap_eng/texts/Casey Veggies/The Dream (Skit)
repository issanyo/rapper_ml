What are you doing?
It's right in front of your face
That thing that you've been working for, for years
The thing that keeps you up at night
Everybody screaming your name
What are you doing?
You dreamed of this moment forever
But you never thought you'd make it this far
But be careful what you wish for
Because dreams do come true
