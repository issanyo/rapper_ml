[Hook]
And I decided to still love it
But music, I put no one above it
Yeah, and this is my ninth wonder
And what you doing in the water doing thunder
And what you doing in the water doing thunder
And what you doing in the water doing thunder

Yo, this what I did, this what I did
First verse

[Verse 1]
I came off, chains off
A cool hype but it was a lame cost
With shoes, the ones on these feet
Old school, moms like these beats
Tryna be cool, T shirts were pricey
But they know I'm priceless, they can't price me
I love you even if you don't like me
I'm from where they watch movies on how to be the hypebeast
[?] just ask us
To get the dime man I took the gas bus
What's up, Casey? Nah man, back up
And I don't wanna act up
In drama class I didn't feel like an actor
Recordings came slow like a tractor
Third song was cool but the first song was wacker
My verse was better but his pockets were fatter
[?]
And we out of here, baby

[Hook]
And I decided to still love it
But music, no one above it
Yeah, and this is my ninth wonder
And what you doing in the water doing thunder
And what you doing in the water doing thunder
Yo, what you doing in the water doing thunder

Yo um, this is what I have man
Second verse is what I have

[Verse 2]
Big dreams, small schemes
Had a lot of shoes and I had small cream
When I was twelve, still buying more bling
But I didn't get offended by the small things
It's my business, worry bout y'all things
I'm solo, won't you worry about y'all team
I write the best and you in love with Spalding
If you want the money, that's what you call balling
Because I want to get a deal and I'm not starving
I want to stand tall and I'm not falling
I was on [?] and they was still [?]
[?], I ain't worried bout y'all dreams
And the success was the motive
I got a mindset so they can't change my focus
Yo Casey, you lying? I'm like yeah, I wrote it
And you already know it
Y'all haters won't know where I'm going

[Hook]
And I decided to still love it
But music, no one above it
Yeah, and this is my ninth wonder
And what you doing in the water doing thunder
And what you doing in the water doing thunder
And what you doing in the water doing thunder

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
[?] flips, big chips
I cooked the food but it was [?]
And they wonder why I act backwards
I'm tired of seeing these Myspace wack rappers
That's just making me want to quit
Then I realize why I begun this shit
Room status with no shirt under it
And like like [?] I'm loving it
And yes ladies, I'm single and they loving it
And what I love, I put nobody above it
And I got to change my ways, because this
[?] and I love it
This is war so let me put my tug in
They told me, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
They told me, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up

[Hook]
And I decided to still love it
But music, no one above it
Yeah, and this is my ninth wonder
And what you doing in the water doing thunder
And what you doing in the water doing thunder
And what you doing in the water doing thunder
