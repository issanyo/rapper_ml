[Intro]
Uh oh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh oh

[Verse 1]
I’m looking for a ridah
Someone who can set me on fire
You’re my supplier
The way you look at me takes me higher
You're the only one that’s flyer
They want me but I’m choosing you
You make em’ all look tired
Time is running out so make a move

[Hook]
If you want me to stay, hold on to me
If you want me to stay, make me believe
If you want me to stay, prove it to me
But you caught up in your ways
If you keep playing games
I gotta leave you
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh

[Verse 2]
You ain't nothing like the lames that just hang around
We’ve been looking for each other like we’re lost and found
If you want me gotta show me what you’re all about
Switching on me like a channel why you changing
You teasing
Scared to make a move you freezing
Gotta make me believe it
And I wanna stay but I need a reason
Cause you been sleeping
On me like we been dreaming
You gotta be real
Stop wasting my time
If you want me here with you

[Hook]
If you want me to stay, hold on to me
If you want me to stay, make me believe
If you want me to stay, prove it to me
But you caught up in your ways
If you keep playing games
I gotta leave you
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
If you want me then baby I can do it
She told me and her ex man was going through it
She said there's something fake about him and she need the truest
Don't want no scrubs, want the boy that really do it
Woah shawty you are really wife goals
Took his chick and left, yeah that's how the games goes
Call me girl, I could get rid of your pain though
[?]
Yeah came home fresh from that tour life
I ain't seen her in a minute, we went all night
I think she from out of space, lil momma out of sight
Casey that boy was a sucker but you made it right
Yeah baby we should just hop on a flight
No luggage, go shopping, and stay for the night
Cute face, slim waist, and that ass right
Act right, I'm the type that might can change your whole life

[Hook]
If you want me to stay, hold on to me
If you want me to stay, make me believe
If you want me to stay, prove it to me
But you caught up in your ways
If you keep playing games
I gotta leave you
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
