[Verse 1]
You know I'm just chillin'
You know they can't tell me nothing
Except it's good and the shit I just dropped is buzzing in the hood
Yeah them niggas anxious to hear it
Fairfax nigga with an Inglewood spirit
And no I never fear shit
Cuz that car hit me in the rear quick
But I didn't lose
Thank God for that
I think he sent me a gift
Cuz every time I look Rogue sending me some new shit
They ask why I'm DTA
Cuz I look 'em in they face and I can tell that they fake
I'm mixing up the dough cuz I'm all about the cake
They all about the hate
Girls wanna date, but I got one I really love
So they gotta wait
But me and her gon' be forever so their chance will never come
It's just step by step, in the best I crept
So as I sneak up, getting messages, some dudes want a feature?
But I feel like Drake, man "no means no"
They say I'm a young nigga with an OG flow
And the hate start building the more we grow
And the better that I do man the more people, show love
Enough is enough, the flow so dangerous
You weak rap cats cannot hang-hang with us
Say my name can't budge
This is everywhere, yo you never there
Man I'm right here
So homie where you at? Tell a hater get back
But I don't really care
Get the crowd like yeah
So yeah let's do it, this that new shit
Y'all cats clueless
Cuz this about to happen just off rapping
It really got me laughing
Think so much man I really need an aspirin
So what is they really asking? I got all the answers
I got all the answers
I said I got all the answers
I got all the answers
I got all the answers

[Hook]
Chilling in the hood, but it's all good
Yeah it's all good
I'm kinda misunderstood but it's all good
Yeah it's all good
They ask me how is the wood I'm like it's all good
Yeah it's all good
My girl says I don't treat her like I should but it's all good
Yeah it's all good
I got some growing to do man, but it's all good
I said it's all good, yeah it's all good
I said it's all good, yeah it's all good
It's all good

[Outro]
Man... tired as hell
And I got school tomorrow
Man what time is it... 1:55 in the morning
Studio
Need to go home, and I got homework?!
Damn
Oh well, it's all good
