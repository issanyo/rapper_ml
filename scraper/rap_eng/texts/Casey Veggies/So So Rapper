[Intro]
Yeah uh
Live from the 310
Get your hands in the sky
Casey V in the house
(Ayo DJ turn my headphones up)
Get your hands up
Get your hands up
Make some motherfuckin' noise
Get your hands up

[Verse 1]
I put my verse on it, killed it so bad
Like I was first on it, I tried make it happen
It wouldn't work for me, and they don't know but rapping
A lot of work homie
So Def Jam and Sony, act like you know me
Don't worry bout them rappers that came before me
Cause they ain't even ready
I was born ready like fish and spaghetti
Them cats getting beheaded, yeah I cut 'em off
I had enough of y'all, I'm with Halle Berry chilling
Yeah, call me monsters ball
I monster ball, yeah go hard
She saying my road dark
I can kill your whole crew with half the shit I wrote dog
Shout out Obama
I'm young and I get it done
Your mom might just want a sponsor
I celebrate more than y'all, call my life Kwanza
Look out for the Super 3 joint, it's an anthem

[Hook]
Flow like [?]
You say I'm so-so
But I am after
Any gold out there
Yeah, homie they tell me it ain't fair
I'm so young and I'm so ahead

[Verse 2]
Tell me where the bread at
Tell me why they hating on me
Tell me where y'all head at
Yeah, I do have a girl
She give me the head that make me learn
Call me [?] Veggies, all beats getting burned
Call me young God, [?] heads must be turned
[?] so fast it got to take its turn

[Outro]
