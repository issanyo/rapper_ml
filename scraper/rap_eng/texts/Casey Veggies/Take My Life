[Intro]
Take take my life
Oh give my love babe
Gonna take take take my life
Oh, give me my love babe

[Hook]
They can take my life, take my heights
Take the name for what is worth
Just so I can have what I need
To reside on this earth
Take the gold, take the shows
Take the money and the foreign clothes
As I finish this sentence, I can feel this in my soul

[Verse 1]
Hallelujah I made it. Give viewers and alternaters a view in love for music, I can do it I’m taking it to the place that X would
Where black people dress good
And all colors love each other and my girl sex good
She makes sure I wear rubber, partially scared of loving
She often be tearing up, things get so mysterious
It’s hard to sign the right deal when all of these labels want us
It’s hard to find which one real
When all of these girls love us
Uh, I let you do your thing ’cause you so head strong
Bread long my mind gone, on the flight, 3 different time zone
When I’m right here ’cause my grind strong
And you more like some styrofoam
Wasn’t on the shit that I was on
When you was 13 I was rehearsing and flirting with my dream
Then we started dating, wasn’t right I stay patient
Now we in paradise lucky pair of dice
My life is insane, so rockin’ champagne
Cutting off my last hoes and give you my last name
Getting on my fine sway, we just wanna party
She just move her body to everyone look her way
I want it all, is my living D so front that, I’m coming back
She got the type of ass I had fun with that, had to run it back

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
On the west side, with the top down
Paying homage, bumping Pac now
Had a lot of promise now I stay down
If you stay working then you can make purpose
They all gonna take me lies like Casey no I won’t hurt you
I had to shade up and rearrange the whole service
This is my soul purpose, maybe I’m just soul searching
Independent on no person, oh man, yeah
Stay humble but I’m up now
For your legs up and don’t let me down
So affection it, so affect me now
It’s evident that I’m ready now
Word, by the time I got to think about my old dough
I was on to the next getting more dough
Coresing the vibe, flexin the thighs
That sort of time and I’m enjoying the ride
Don’t know my life, doing what’s right
The amenities, my enigma reads in December
I’m on summer shit, hot boy but I’m so cold
The next up that’s not you
Don’t rush in places when you need to take your time
Take your time patience rush
Choosing to rush, so I told you baby take your time
’cause I know we can live it up
Let me know what’s up?

[Hook] x2
