[Verse 1 : Price]
One time, look
I didin't see too much growin' up, growin' rough
Birthdays party wondering if my pop's showin' up
But, ten times outta ten he never entended
Mama play that dare role so I was never offended
I just, starting writin' raps up on my kitchen table
Eatin' dry ramen noodes with no cable
Focusing on them biggest stack
You backtrack with them bitter raps
Your girl text fast, I hit her back
Your boyfriend mad, I figured that
Models, no more groupies
We went from [?] to Gucci
And them niggas that I see rainy days with
Are the same niggas that I'm gettin' paid with
That's real life so raise your glass up
If you gettin' your cash up, ain't gotta ask us
Keep it G don't gas us for them fast bucks
Lil niggas that blach up but we the last up
And ain't no lookin' past us
BOW!

[Hook : Price]
Sundays, we cruisin' in my city with the AC
Blowing you can ride with me
Real game and I'm givin' it
Cause it started as a dream now I'm livin' it
In a world full of people that's tellin' you no
In a young generation that's sellin' their soul
I wanna judge but who am I?
So I choose a side cause it's do or die
It's do or die

[Verse 2 : Oktane]
It's do or die
And me
I'm ridin' to the beat or my own drum and hum
Prices on that guitar y'a watchin' drum
These girls are faker than they bag
Cause they can't say what they feel
So I just focus on that pain that's all that's seems to be real
Because love is so dearly departed
And it's weird how we started
We used to just be the youngins
Now we're clearly the hardest
All my pretty home girls is out here strippin' now
They sexin' lame niggas for status they just trippin' now
And me, everybody tell us how that we next
No more sad trips to that [?] all these girls they givin' me sex
As that [?] at the club it's the same status givin' me checks
And them women you in love with are just givin' me stress, so
In this moment of proximity nigga
All I need is positivity nigga
Because my brothers, they got so many enemies nigga
But I'm just using this brain your girl givin' me nigga
I love these

It's do or die

[Verse 3 : Casey Veggies]
Young Veggies do or die
Kill the verse that suicide
In the hearse like who am I, John Doe head honcho
Young niggas run everythang I learn that, she pronto
Left school then looked back, ain't nothing in my convos
[?] I'm 'bout these nachos
Press play on the audio then got the dough
You play [?]
When shit droppin'
Got it on lock nigga D.T.A, just get pay
Do your shit nigga get your cake, run your game
Cop that chain, stay in your lane and don't get slay
Get money straight like 46 days
I can get money like 46 ways
Constant, new shit I'm grindin'
Self-made, self-pay
She throw it back, she self-lay
[?] cats gon' get paid, it's young niggas movement
My old hoes behind me left I'm an amusement
Deuces, so cool since '06
I had chicks, I have bitch
Was poppin' before this rap shit
