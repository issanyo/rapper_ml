[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Yes sir, the texture is fresher
I'm next up, expect us, we better
My dreams got me like "Oh, where's my cheddar?"
My ego got me like "Homie, you ain't [?]"
Yes sir, the texture is fresher
I'm next up, expect us, we better
My dreams got me like "Oh, where's my cheddar?"
My ego got me like "Homie, you ain't [?]"

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I be thinking like we don't think alike
Homie step back I need space to write cause I need space to write
Call me Satisfying Veggies, I give 'em what they like
I spit that out of sight, I am brightest in the light
I be on some other shit, no I do not balance right
I had to switch it up, credit I don't get enough
That's why I'm sliding my ATM like nigga what
I'm from the West but I flow East
Tell me who I do I compete with? You niggas easy
You gotta believe me
My dreams is like graduation, my ego was late registration
Achieving my goals like having babies
So I'ma keep pushing until I make it, make it

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Yes sir, the texture is fresher
I'm next up, expect us, we better
My dreams got me like "Oh, where's my cheddar?"
My ego got me like "Homie, you ain't [?]"
Yes sir, the texture is fresher
I'm next up, expect us, we better
My dreams got me like "Oh, where's my cheddar?"
My ego got me like "Homie, you ain't [?]"

[Verse 2: H.O.P.E.]
See I am here to cut addicted like woah
On my money making mission, I see dollars I go
When I get back anybody in my position
I told LAPD dodger I don't hide O's no more
Think about it, this is top tier
Do not fear unless we in the same lane
We ain't in the same lane, we hardly do the same thing
I critically think why you here rapping about the same thing
Eat these little niggas up, smile and let my fangs hang
Jeans pressed, tailored tight, shit I'm sitting pretty, huh
Swear I'm taking all the shine I don't even give it none
Stars getting brighter, you just fighting for attention, huh
You gon' make a big scene, go and get you some
Hey, this where I cool out, cool out
I just chill and bud out
Bring the drinks and food out
If you ain't ultra real then I don't care what you bout
If you ain't ultra real then I don't care what you bout

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Yes sir, the texture is fresher
I'm next up, expect us, we better
My dreams got me like "Oh, where's my cheddar?"
My ego got me like "Homie, you ain't [?]"
Yes sir, the texture is fresher
I'm next up, expect us, we better
My dreams got me like "Oh, where's my cheddar?"
My ego got me like "Homie, you ain't [?]"

[Verse 3: H.O.P.E.]
I'm king capital Ego everywhere that we go
Haters bound to build up, I give it the old [?]
Hit the spot in slow-mo, my presence is on Tivo
Chuck the deuce, grab my money and hit the streets, yo
Check my sneaks yo and my seams yo
[?] but you ain't this clean though
Uncle Dave beats make a nigga speak slow
Follow the leader, nigga

[Verse 4: Casey Veggies]
My old lovers talk to me then don't hear from me in weeks
They have visions of me coming back but it's something I don't see
I McLove it on the beat, I be killing when I sleep
Superbad with the pen and pad, really rad it's really sad
That's you can not keep it up
Chilling man, my sneakers up
Every beat, I beat it up so niggas want the features huh
Feed 'em nuts, they eat it up, you quirrel niggas acting sus
The act is up so back it up
We back on the bus

[Outro: Casey Veggies]
We got them dreams and egos
We got them dreams and egos
