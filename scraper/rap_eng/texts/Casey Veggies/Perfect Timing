[Intro]
No matter what, we gon' get it
CG4
I heard you, I feel you

[Hook]
I been searching for the real so long, I can't find it
First play don't go right, I keep grinding
Jumped in the game so young, I been shining
Baby girl drink all night, it's perfect timing
I took that pressure, I made diamonds (Blinded)
I'm on the road, I been grinding (Shinin')
Millionaire dreams, I got to find it (Find it)
Let's get to the money, it's perfect timing

[Verse 1]
Another sunny day in LA, just let the top down
Pull up in that black on black, shut the block down
Shorty wanna roll with me, yeah she in my town
Said they all sound the same but this how I sound
Remember back in '06, we raised the climate
I find it, funny how you need to be reminded
I'm blinded cause my eyes is where the prize is
Your eyes is hidin' behind something like disguises
Young Veggies, the wait is over
The city ready 8 years in the game, I been rocking steady
Copped the five, ain't no stopping til I cop the Bentley
God got me, my grandma watch me, yeah they all that's in me
Oh, winning all the time yeah that's all I really know
Been had it got a taste it's time to get more
Once it's right up in your face it's hard to let it go
Casey first place yeah, [?]

[Verse 2]
This that shit that make me want to stay up, pay up
This for everybody that done wait up, my cake up
Now them girls come easy like a layup
Say what? I been making moves like a freight truck
Ass so fat, I give a damn if she got A cups, I'm raw
I been living life above the law
Thank god, these kids see the boy and they applaud
They know me round the world
You know I'm getting dough abroad
Dog, yeah you know I'm prolly with your broad
Ten bottles to the face, she gon' break the law
Balling all fucking day, we don't never fall
Bout to cop that AP new face
Flood that shit enough
Sub zero flows told you I'm cold nigga
If I'm getting richer, all of my bros gettin' it
New whips and I switched up all my hoes niggas
I'm getting that money that make her come and get it
