[Intro: Sir Michael Rocks]
Six
Duck ass, jive ass, turkey ass
Fraud ass, dog ass, lyin' ass
Clown ass, punk ass, mark ass, bitch ass
Niggas

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks]
Don't try to play me man, cause I ain't with that shit
Slobbin' on my knob, my name she can't forget
Bussin', man bussin'
Bussin', man it's bussin'
Bussin', man bussin'
Bussin', man we bussin'

[Verse 1: Sir Michael Rocks]
Man you trippin' niggas love it when I gas up
I cross my heart and hope to live through the bad stuff
Now lift your shirt, I wanna see your rib
That pussy fat what you be feeding it? I'm back up on the scene again
You never catch me lacking, never happen, never will
You put that pussy on the pedestal and pet it still
You got the game wrong, you need to brainstorm
I'm on a campaign, titties and champagne with us
If you ever see us poppin' in yo section
Big ass diamond ring but I ain't pop a bitch the question, huh
She say she wit the shits
If you by yourself I ain't wit that shit

[Bridge: Sir Michael Rocks]
I ain't wit that shit, I ain't wit that shit
I ain't wit that shit, I ain't wit that shit
I ain't wit that shit, I ain't wit that shit
In case you forget, I ain't wit that shit

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks]
Don't try to play me man, cause I ain't with that shit
Slobbin' on my knob, my name she can't forget
Bussin', man bussin'
Bussin', man it's bussin'
Bussin', man bussin'
Bussin', man we bussin'
Don't try to play me man, cause I ain't with that shit
Slobbin' on my knob, my name she can't forget](3463507)
Bussin', man bussin'
Bussin', man it's bussin'
Bussin', man bussin'
Bussin', man we bussin'

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Baby girl, fell in love wit the whip game
Type of money make a young chick go insane
Jacket fifteen hundred, get it when I want it
Spend it cause I got it, smash it in the morning
She know I'm the prince of the west side
It gas her up, yet she leave with her head high
Japanese denim, yea I'm wit it
European whippin'
I look like I could be from somewhere overseas
Get down on your knees
You messin' with some cool kids slash niggas from the streets
That mean don't play no games
Don't waste my time
Don't say no names

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks]
Don't try to play me man, cause I ain't with that shit
Slobbin' on my knob, my name she can't forget
Bussin', man bussin'
Bussin', man it's bussin'
Bussin', man bussin'
Bussin', man we bussin'
Don't try to play me man, cause I ain't with that shit
Slobbin' on my knob, my name she can't forget](3463507)
Bussin', man bussin'
Bussin', man it's bussin'
Bussin', man bussin'
Bussin', man we bussin'

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
Timb boots with the sweatpants, do the jet dance
Used to call us monkeys, now they call me Bape man
Suzy, Anna gold chains like I'm MC Hammer
Chicken shack on Burban St. out in Louisiana
Paid dues, I just rep where I was raised fool
Lame dudes duplicate my wave like a wave pool
Stay solid, gold teeth with the 12 solids
White and yellow gold, it look crazy when I'm smilin'
Barney's shoppin', Marcelo coppin'
What you think I'm fallin' off, it's not an option
Me and Mikey know we not straight outta Compton
But we some niggas with some attitudes about to profit
Ya heard me

[Bridge: Sir Michael Rocks]
I ain't wit that shit, I ain't wit that shit
I ain't wit that shit, I ain't wit that shit
I ain't wit that shit, I ain't wit that shit
In case you forget, I ain't wit that shit

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks]
Don't try to play me man, cause I ain't with that shit
Slobbin' on my knob, my name she can't forget
Bussin', man bussin'
Bussin', man it's bussin'
Bussin', man bussin'
Bussin', man we bussin'
Don't try to play me man, cause I ain't with that shit
Slobbin' on my knob, my name she can't forget](3463507)
Bussin', man bussin'
Bussin', man it's bussin'
Bussin', man bussin'
Bussin', man we bussin'
