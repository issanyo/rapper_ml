[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]

Don't know how I made it out, this shit was crazy
It's my time to shine I gotta make a statement
We just searching for some inspiration

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
You know this your jam, LA to Japan
Baby this your chance to forget your man
She's from the mother land, I'm from another land
So tell me what's the plan
Lately I've been spending time on the west coast
Money on my mind, I'm like let's go
Life been up and down but I'm blessed though
Baby hold it down for the set though

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]

On a cloud feel like I'm hydroplaning
