[Intro]

[Hook 1]
Nigga I don't need your feature, nigga I am a feature (I'm the man)
I set it off like Queen Latifah, she respect me like Aretha
I'm with a bad young diva and she got her faith in Jesus
We say we don't but we all need 'em, I got love for all people

[Verse 1]
With my cousin, with the hood, swear that we be living good
Bad bitch looking right, at the end of the tunnel I can see the light
Getting money like I should, who else gon' pay the rent?
They all discriminate against us but who else gon' say this shit
I'm the young dope dealer, my uncle was a dope boy
My momma was a hard worker, she a beautiful woman, she shouldn't work none
I love her, I got hope for her, all them other girls get in line
If lil mama stay down, I swear I put in double time
High off life though, riding on my Puma bike though
I put my heart in everything I write though
Yeah I got stripes though
Nigga I got hood credit, yeah I got street fame
Fourth quarter I just play the game
I'm just staying in my lane

[Hook 2]
The label telling me I need a feature
Nigga I am a feature (I'm the man)
I set it off like Queen Latifah, she respect me like Aretha
I said I'm with a bad young diva and she got her faith in Jesus
I got love for all people, no matter what race, all people

[Verse 2]
In Inglewood down to Louisiana, two pieces
With the fries, fresh veggies she steady eating
To be alive, baby tell me what is your meaning
Sold out shows, I just wanna do arenas
I'ma fly nigga, girl I wanna know your secrets
Put that on my life though
Put my heart in everything I write though
I'm just tryna tell my story
If the shit ain't real then I can't enjoy it, yeah I can't enjoy it

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Oh, what's going on world?
It's your favorite, your uncle Snoop D-O-double-Gizzle
And you're now tuned in with my nephew Young Veggies
And we out here actin' up
