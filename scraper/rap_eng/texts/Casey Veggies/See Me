[Intro: Casey Veggies]
Yea
Aw Man
Uh
What up Troh What up
You already know what it is

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I know you See ME
Make it look easy
I made her say she love me
Then repeat it
Baby got ass up in them tights
She tryna tease me
She Pop it out of nowhere, just like a genie
I'm the one
You don't believe me?
Just wait until I'm on
You Gon' See Me
She fucking up my zone
I told her beat it
My new chick so bad, I can't keep her a secret
I'mma smash, then get to the cash
Got the Audi coupe, I used to have a bus pass
Yea, the young boy grown now
I known now, She shake it fast in my zone now
She used to never call the boy
But she blowing up my phone now
Like WHOA
Can you see the tables turn
I beat the pussy, while the candles burns
And I be saying things I never heard
Influencing people with my words

[Hook: Sealy Troh]
I know you See Me
When you See Me
Nigga I be going hard
But life is easy
I'm on the road
I''m at the beaches
I take for granted when she says she's never leaving,X2

[Verse 2: Sealy Troh]
What up with the Fees
It's that kid, Sealy T
Just Re-upped on my grams
We Gon' burn every leaf
Yea we headed out to Vegas
Watch em turn every cheek
Staying up all night, but nah we don't tweak
One of a kind women, got me grinning, Got me cheesing
I'm in the city one night
And she says she's never leaving
All that heavy breathing
Inhale,exhale
Giving you a workout, with work out on the scale
I know you See ME
Please believe me
Even all your friends wanna come and meet me
I got lines like Six Flags
Double wide Zig-Zags
I could die tomorrow Nigga
So I take them big drags
Magnum, dick bag
I switch girls when I get lag
If you ain't with us then sit back
I'm cruising where you slipped at
We on the rise where you got capped
So watch us like a finale
I know you See ME riding round
Y'all should be keeping tally!


[Hook: Sealy Troh]
I know you See Me
When you See Me
Nigga I be going hard
But life is easy
I'm on the road
I''m at the beaches
I take for granted when she says she's never leaving,X2


I know you See Me!
