[Verse 1]
It's so irregular, younger, but so ahead of you
I put her friend on the leash same time I was petting her
I'm the type to pull up in the new coupe, spit it like a movie, nigga no spoofs
It's like I put my flow down on my notepad and my ho pad when she was opening those legs
You the type of nigga probably rock Pro-Keds
Got no swag, homie that shit so sad
I'm the illest, all hype killer, thinking something bigger like an all white dealer
She look too bad, then I might have to hit her, got girls in line, and girls on their grind

[Hook]
Oh, man, I came in this bitch with a lot more money and a lot more chips
Bad little mama, hotter than the sauna
Got on my Pradas, and I'm looking like a scholar
Oh, man, I came in this bitch with a lot more money and a lot more chips
Bad little mama, hotter than the sauna
Got on my Pradas, and I'm looking like a scholar

[Verse 2]
I'm so out of here, you should call the coast guard
Above most y'all, but I don't boast at all
Ball hard like when I was in my backyard
You slack dogs still trying to touch backboard
I don't see nobody, party with my posse
We be gettin naughty like relationships on Maury
Had a dream, now it's partial, I get money, like the stories
Like some meals on my team, big money like I'm 40
I'm like Obama when I come through the town
Do my round, let's shut this shit down
You probably never know my mind
But I'll tell you something right now, it's my time

[HOOK]
Oh, man, I came in this bitch with a lot more money and a lot more chips
Bad little mama, hotter than a sauna
Got on my Pradas, yet I'm living like a scholar
Oh, man, I came in this bitch with a lot more money and a lot more chips
Bad little mama, hotter than a sauna
Got on my Pradas, yet I'm living like a scholar
