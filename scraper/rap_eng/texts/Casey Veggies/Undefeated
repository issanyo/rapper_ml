[Verse 1:]
Yeah, I hit a lit that put me on top, I cop the whip that make her drop the top
At first she didn’t want me, now she all  in my spot
Now she see how I live, she all in my chop
What the fuck niggas on? I could careless bout fuck  nigga’s on
I got the bitch she be loving my song
She take off her thong, now we be getting it until early in the morn
I’ll fuck with you but I couldn’t wife it, zero take is just a cycle
Why do I need a chick that’s just like you? If it’s justified then am young Michael
Out of shot town where them kid is at, catch a nigga sleeping where they living at
There he take a chain can’t get it back, people is getting money but they don’t get us back
Her ass fat, sitting on my lap, I smashed that and put her on the mat
I don’t trust nigga, we don't get along, I don’t love bitches, i send them home
Was good nigga, you friend now foe, cause the way you acting dog, I don’t now
We was one hundred, Now we fifty fifty, am a hunted bad boys get with me

[Chorus:] [x2]
Your nigga name is in the headlines, boy you better read it
Trying to get the money hitting deadlines, boy you beat it
Wasn’t eating then now I’m eating now, yeah i know you see it
Team full a mother fucker gold getter, boy I’m undefeated

[Verse 2:]
Ain’t got a squat on my back, no losses, wind blowing all through the city, it so hard
Niggas should a rap like this more often, killing shit all across the board
No chalk guide then, through the halls of the moonlight
I said from I do the beat, imma do right
Why grind hell a hard for a whole lot a shine, y’all fucked up, win a game, need a light
Hey look and run away for the kid in the cut  whipping all of your dope
You can catch me in the kitchen, cooked it up, gut it out
Boy that’s quick money, am just getting started, you ain’t really heard shit from me
Ain’t no plan B for them boy, I’m just going fuck up the game
When my niggas make noise, and I got the track booming
Where out here doping, I’m always here working
No sleep for the boy, don’t trip nigga, get off my dick
No shit, I was flying back in now the boy got hits
Pearl got mappers for  the joint so lit to the clouds don’t move
Bitch am here running shit, never tripping when am walking down the road
Less travel, slip and you lose the war full of battles, don’t tweet, don’t sleep
Till the sun comes up and the moon’s way out of my reach
All for the growing and it go so good when you growth the m
And the boy been sold, and the house build from the root down
Wall, ho, where’s they really got her, when the drag that ho and the bullshit stop
You can be so tough, stand tall with the crime and a case see us
Never running out niggas, I just read up
You paying for the fame, nigga made their own lane

[Chorus] [x2]
Your nigga name is in the headlines, boy you better read it
Trying to get the money hitting deadlines, boy you beat it
Wasn’t eating then now I’m eating now, yeah i know you see it
Team full a mother fucker gold getter, boy I’m undefeated
