(Verse 1)
18 I'm in it, they say I'm barely legal
I'm looking at the fame from a distance like a peep-hole
Ridin' roun' town mo' change, mo' steelo
These women up on these rappers they gon' go wherever we go
Yeah, you see me stuntin' I'm supposed to do it
I wouldn't say that I'm the man but I'm the closest to it
So understand that I am way far from perfection you don't really gotta hate
Just admire the progression
I wanna see some ass, she wanna see some cash
It's no problem see the youngin' money is legit
Even if I'm in a whip that I had to go out and rent I could still do it
If she said "Make it rain trick,"
Yeah, Leimert Park what it do
If Dom running the one, I'm cool with running the two
I swear she all on me, but go ahead and quote it
Treat the girl like a gusher as I bust it wide open ahhh

(Hook)

Swag it like a rocking chair
Back and Fourth, never stop
We on top, make it drop
Polo Shirt, had to cop
Windows up, pass the cops
Racial profiling, show styling I'm an astronaut
Flowing like a river man you little niggas faucet drops
Like I'm phillip rivers I just throw it up, watch it drop
Don't know what I'm talking bout' its money on the ground that's in this spot
Funny that you other niggas thought i'd stop so it could open up and get back yo' spot
Not knowing that I made it hot better switch up what you saying patna'
I'm so, on another level digging deeper than a shovel so the shit I spit is so hot sot hot
I call that shit hello what's up (swag, swag, swag, )
I call that shit hello I say on another level digging deeper than shovel
So that shit I spit is so hot so hot I call that shit Hello what's up

(Hook)

(Verse 3)

I ain't never had much, and that's why I gotta focus
And every new thing that I get? dying to just show it
And ahhhh yeah, out these youngins' we just go the hardest
And see we got the city buzzing like the clippers starting
I tell these women I love em' and I don't mean it She feening
And see my goal is simply to be between her uh
Yeah, I wouldn't say that I am wrong
But I am doing all these thangs'that my momma wouldn't condone
And this for everybody who hearing me for the first time
And thinking to themselves " I den' struck upon a goldmine,"
Yeah, so baby how you wanna do this?
I'm young fly and ready I suggest we get to moving
It's all happening shawty see the dough is coming plenty
And you would be amazed, I ain't even in my 20's, swag
