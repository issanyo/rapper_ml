[Hook]
Yeah this is the life
They not be telling you right
But I'ma give you the real
I'ma show you the light

[Verse 1]
I been writing, I been fighting
Just started recording, chasing water for some lightning
And they know I ain't putting nothing above it
I been through enough shit, I got A.D.D
My mom was crazy, my pops was in the car with Jay-Z
When that car hear me
And that damn star on my leg ain't spiffy
Who should I talk to, Ashley or Tiffany?
Come get it if you want it but a nigga kinda scary
A nigga kind [?]

Yeah, I'm kind of weird
When I told you I was here
But I know God got me
My head used to be too big for my body
Open my first rhyme now but now they can't stop me
Yeah, this is the life

[Verse 2]
So it's first and foremost
Casey Veggies voted foremost likely to succeed
Martin Luther King
Yeah I might not be what it seems
I'm just a nigga that loves his se
Jeans
I have a dream that I will forever stay clean
I will forever stay clean
And I got the meanest adlibs
Why you think Hov in the back laughing
Why you think they all applausing, screaming and clapping
And why you think I'm what's happenin'
Forget the haters, just listen
Niggas say I'm Kanye but I'm a tad bit different
But I'm a tad bit different
But I'm a tad bit different

[Hook]
Yeah this is the life
They not be telling you right
But I'ma give you the real
I'ma show you the light

[Verse 3]
Yeah, go ahead dance
And just pull up your pants
Show some love to your man
Yeah girl, just choose me
I want you to be by my side like undefeated [?]
And your couture's so juicy
And I ain't talking about Mexican food when I say I Love Lucy
When I say I Love Lucy
Niggas sleeping on my Rogue Status

[Bridge]

[Hook]
Yeah this is the life
They not be telling you right
But I'ma give you the real
I'ma show you the light

[Outro]
Yeah girl, just choose me
I want you to be by my side like undefeated [?]
And your couture's so juicy
And I ain't talking about Mexican food when I say I Love Lucy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
