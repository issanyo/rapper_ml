[Hook]
I love me some you (say it one more time)
I love me some you
I love me some you (I love me some you)
I love me some you (I love me some you)

[Verse 1]
I love me some you, I be riding coupe
I be rapping my life, show you how I do
I just keep around, I need something true
Is she really rockin’, guess I never knew
Or I never know, till we live and grow
Tried to ..my chain, but if you see I through
She say I’m a rebel, I’m just on my level
You deserve a medal, I just want you to feel special
I love me some you, this ain’t nothing new
Guess I shouldn't work, I know we'll be cool
I don't never talk, she don’t never tell
I don’t never listen, she don’t never hear

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I love me some you, but trust at least a few
If I would go to school, I can be with you
You know I’ve been playing, I like joking too
How far can it go? I’ll always let it show
Sometimes we try too hard, I should just let it go
You wanna go for what, just let me open up
My thoughts be bottled in, I need to cough it up
Panamanian girl, with you eyes to the world
Yeah you’re so precious, I shouldn’t be so reckless
When dealing with your heart, should handle that we care
Ain’t like them regular ballers and girl I’m doing something new
They always got something to say, when you doin you

[Hook]

[Bridge]
What I tell you shouldn’t make you different
You should respect the fact that I made it livin’ yeah
What I tell you shouldn’t make you different
In the first place I already made you feel me

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I love me some you, just keep me in the loop
Even if it hurtin’ just tell me the truth
Had to take a pause just like an interlude
Then get you in the nude, this what I dream to do
Yeah you so precious and that ain't no extras
I like your whole text, just a young boy and my fam from Texas
Where we could go when we get old
And our kids can know, I love me some you

[Hook]

[Bridge]

Yeah, yeah
Ladies and gentlemen
It’s so special, so special

I love me some you
I love me, I love me some you
