[Mandrill Sample]
The sun is in the sky but I refuse to smile
Still darkness lingers in my mind

[Intro]
We customized greatly
And they customized greatly
Now everybody customized greatly
Yeah, this is what you've been waiting for

[Verse]
Like a stairway with no exit, except the roof dude
I'm gonna end up on top
The girls that wasn't feelin me, they gonna end up on jock, hah
And just stop
Listen to the boy and listen to the kid that never played with toys
Bumpin through your speakers, but never made with noise
I'm as cool as they come
But yeah they gonna show poise
So if the sun is the sky, then the world will fly
Cause I ain't really feelin' it
All these songs, I was really killin' it
So this the last beat I'ma do that's not mine
Wasn't new on hooks, I thought it was my time
But, wait till the album comes out
We gonna bring the samples and drums out
Hey, this what I've been waiting for
It's your turn, go ahead and take the floor
Casey Veggies on tour
How does that sound? Real good for me
If the sun is the sky, it's gonna be too bright for you and me
Words on the paper, I feel free, I feel free...
All the haters do your thing, and hustlers make your change
And nawh, I ain't gonna change
Let the shoestrings hang, just tryin to make a change

That new nigga to yall is what I'm finna be
That new nigga to yall is what I'm finna be, I came in with such a great intensity
