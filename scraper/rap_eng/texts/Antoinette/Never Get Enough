[ Spinderella ]
Antoinette, what's up, girl?
How you doin?
[ Antoinette ]
Yo, what's up, Spin, what's up, Pep, what y'all doin?
[ Pepa ]
Chillin, chillin, chillin
[ Spinderella ]
I mean I was alright until this jerk tried to pinch my butt
[ Pepa ]
I almost smacked him for it
[ Antoinette ]
Word?
[ Spinderella ]
Yeah, he bugged out, bugged out
[ Antoinette ]
...see what you sayin
Cause honey, these days some guys, honey, they just never get enough
[ Spinderella ]
Sho nuff
[ Pepa ]
That's what I'm sayin

1-2, here we go
To Washington, D.C.'s (Go! Go!)
Slow - tempo
Guys, if you're cool, I'll please ya
But since I got a big old butt, I'ma tease ya
With somethin def that I bring for
You and yours truly, so let me ring your
Bell inside this place tonight
And my body is yours, fellas, right?
Psych

[ guy 1 ]
Never get enough
[ guy 2 ]
Aw
[ guy 1 ]
Of that sweet foxy thing
[ guy 2 ]
She is foxy, you know she's she foxy
[ guy 1 ]
I want her all the time, youknowmsayin?
...cause yo
I never get enough
Of that sweet lovely thing
I just got to make her mine

Now let's get back to this smooth groove
With rhymes cool enough, they'll soothe
With looks good enough to quench your
Thirst, and if it's not good enough, I'll drench ya
(Yeah, go head, girl) (Go, go)
But what he wants to - no, no, no
I can't let him play me
So - ehm, why don't you say we
(?Sit us in a cell?) back up off me
You ain't the tea, so smell the coffee
And if I got a song I'll sing mines
If my butt looks tight in my jeans, yo, I swing mines
Touch my body, I call your bluff
Cause some guys just never get enough

[ guy 2 ]
And she called your bluff, money
[ guy 1 ]
My bluff?
[ guy 2 ]
Mh-hm
[ guy 1 ]
Oh man
Never get enough
Of that sweet foxy thing
I just want it all the time
Never get enough
Of that sweet lovely, lovely thing
If I get her, I make her mine
Let's go
Let's go after her, come on, let's go

(Yo, he wants it) Sure, he can have my autograph
(He don't want that!) Well, then I think I oughta laugh
Cause guys will play like they love you
Give em an inch and they think they're above you
And that's the chance for him to diss me
And for a girl like moi, that is risky
That's why I gotta come on tough
But some guys - they just never get enough!

[ guy 1 ]
Never get enough
Of that sweet foxy thing
[ guy 2 ]
I just gotta make her mine
Why can't she see?
[ guy 1 ]
I never get enough
Of that sweet, sweet foxy thing

Once again, here we go
To Washington, D.C.'s (Go! Go!)
Slow - tempo
Guys, if you're cool, I'll please ya
But since I got a big old butt, I'ma tease ya
With somethin def that I bring for
You and yours truly, so let me ring your
Bell inside this place tonight
We gonna end it like this -
