Antoinette: What time is it?
???: It's 12 o'clock, midnight
Antoinette: By this time tomorrow? He's out of here

[Verse 1]
Antoinette is back from hibernation
I'm in tune so please don't change the station
[?]
'Cause the boss' job is never done
So if you think I'm scrounging and lounging
You're bugging, you better plug in, 'cause I'm drugging
Just like Doctor Who in your bloodstream
Captivating atmospheres with a death beam
Now those who slept or those with nightmares
Awaken, peep it through, and I'm right here
The operation, Antoinette is heard
...and that's word

[Hook]
She operates around the clock
So don't you ever sleep

[Verse 2]
Raise your hands to God, and feel blessed
Misbelieve, you're face to face with death
Or should I live and let die, 'cause you're sniffin'
With the nerve to bitch about the heat inside the kitchen
Your lots are low, and yo
I'll take the advice, you follow with nothing but foul play
And now you can know the truth to spread the deal
(Did somebody say "deal"?) Damn real
Your eyes are closed, supposed to see 'em
And the posse I roll with is one supreme bein'
So bring your big bad wolf and I'ma blow up
We'll take no shorts, so don't even show up
I got a purpose to serve, and I'm servin' it
Try to take mines and your loss will be permanent
Once again my operation's heard
...and that's word

[Hook]
She operates around the clock
So don't you ever sleep

[Verse 3]
Now, a Buddha will bless, a teacher will teach
And since I got the gift speech, yo I'ma speak
And as I speak, you stand there, yeah what
I'm watching you fade like a flat-top haircut
But I'm not ready to go out, I'm ready to blow up
So make like it's *20 Below* and freeze
As I prepare to rap again
Teach to those who can't read or rip
Now here we go, here we go, on a new search
As the Gangstress gives birth
So pamper life, don't scamper
THOSE WHO TAMPER GET THROWN IN A HAMPER
Now once again my operation's heard
...and that's word
