(Me!) (me!)
(Me!) (me!) (me!)
(Me!) (me!)
(Me!) (me!) (me!)

Has anybody ever tried to change ya
Shape ya, mix and twist, rearrange ya?
And tell ya, you gotta, gotta
Become a lawyer, politician or a doctor?
Why, oh why, I wonder
If you ain't all of that, you're a bleep and a blunder
(Yo, that's wack) Word up, Gee
Yo, why can't they see?

I wanna be me, yeah
Oh-oh
Me, yeah
Me, nobody else		(2x)

My oh my, I must've shocked ya
I'm paid in full, but I'm no doctor
I got a mind of my own, and I used it
And as for an occupation I choose this
Just because your path I didn't take
Doesn't mean capital A made a mistake
That's the problem, you try to rule us
You think you school us, but do nothin but fool us
Too much gold and too much make-up
My dress too short? Yo, you better wake up
Cause I ain't you and you ain't me
So, why can't you see

I wanna be me, yeah
Oh-oh
Me, yeah
Me, nobody else		(2x)

(Me!) (me!) (me!)		(2x)

I wanna be -

Me, therefore I have to live up
To my expectations, so I can't give up
Cause one downs me and jokes
But just like smoke that happens to provoke
(Me) (Trust it)
So bust It
And keep on strivin and keep on strugglin
Cause those who talk small don't mean nothin
And you gots to be the best that you can be
And as long as it's up to me -

I wanna be me, yeah
Oh-oh
Me, yeah
Me, nobody else		(2x)

So - if anybody ever tries to change ya
Shape ya, mix and twist, rearrange ya
And tell ya, you gotta, gotta
Become a lawyer, politician or a doctor
Tell em: you ain't got the right to choose for me
