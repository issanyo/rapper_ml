[Intro]
Day time, night time, any time's the right time
Who's the boss? Of course, Antoinette's rhyme

[Verse 1]
Now here we go, hug your stereo
It might pump or jump around
Bum rush the sound beat it down run it in the ground
The bigger they are the harder they fall, oh well they fell
Their records couldn't sell even if you gave 'em away free
Ah, honey you're just a wannabe
Rap star, and now you're trying to front on me
But kids who play will suffer when the beat is on
And the going gets tougher when the heat is on
I go off and I be keeping it kept on
Make like a rash, break out or get stepped on
Step child you're just a son in this
And Antoinette is like runnin this
Yeah dance go ahead, do that
Instead pick up your head cause I flew that
Antoinette taking no loss wearing no shorts
But telling you who's the boss

[Verse 2]
If you were brave because you escaped or get hit wit'
You little nit wit
You better get wit' Antoinette on set cause I'm fed up
I'm going head up, now get up
Ducks who get stuck in
Grab your cup and I'ma fill it to the brim
So take a sip don't bite
Your lip don't take bites out or it's gonna be M.C.'s lights out
The young the old the bold they all like be looking
Because I'm hooking, but I ain't a hooker
So save that for T.J
That he-say and she-say ain't no threat
I'm knocking out gangs with no stress
So who's the boss? It ain't a weak chick
So let me launch a rhyme and let the beat kick

[Verse 3]
Lace up so you could face up and hit the lineup
Play me wrong and yes you might wind up
Dead on arrival, because this is survival of the fittest
So do your pushups and get wit' it
Before I go off without that
No question about that
("They're closing in!") Yo, I doubt that
Face to face, rhyme for rhyme
Fist to fist, sweet dreams when rings hit lips so
Slow down, I won't go down in a throw down
Yup she's out now that's another hoe down
You should be knowing this
You can't flow with this
The best, the gangstress, the def soloist
I roll, the mic transforms like a decep
A's in effect so who could possibly e-fect
The chick with soul, the boss who has to master
To ducks who front I make like a ghetto and blast ya'
I'm hyper, riper, doper, stronger
Breakbeats get broken and rhymes last longer
I'll find and lose ya and left ya lost
And you sweat to death like a horse
Now who's the boss?
