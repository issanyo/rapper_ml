[ VERSE 1: Antoinette ]
Ain't I something? So many rappers wanna get me
They stand in front of me and can't hit me
So sling, hm, I just love it
And if you're jealous, I think nothin of it
Cause with me, you can't mess with
You wanna try this? That's a death wish
And survival is unrealistic
And if you're broken up, let me fix this
Matter of fact, I can't let a rapper win
I ain't re-run, that ain't happenin
They try to sample me everyday somehow
And try to dis this? Ts.. come, come now
Why move in my direction?
Play it safe, get some protection
Silly rabbits, they bring a condom
So I laugh, and then I bomb them
Bring the bomb squad, I'm a time bomb
I explode, even when I rhyme calm
Takin titles, what is that, some type of joke?
Oh - I hoped
Cause if it was, you'd be in trouble
Hurry, quick, move on the double
In this rap game you're a reject
So make like a tape and eject
Now there, don't try to play bold
Half-step to Antoinette, you shake, rattle & roll

[ male voice whispering ]
(Knock em out, come on girl, knock em out
Knock em out)

Shake, rattle & roll

(Knock em out, come on girl, knock em out
Knock em out)

We can do this, cause you're child's play
Don't toy me, or must I say
Yo, break north, step back one
Hold your eye, or it'll be a black one
So get Red Cross, cause that's your need
And as for me, I'm a rapper of a raw breed
You wanna move on, then move quick
Who's the best? Let's see who you've picked
Ts, ts, ts... go get her
Bring two, we're havin double head up
It's such fun puttin two heads out
Yo G Off, get a few ???? out
Cause they believed the hype and
Now they'll be wipin
Up the mess I left behind me
I lose myself so they can't find me
Now the Gangstress is at large and
You're a private and I'm a sergeant
So troops, it's time to get fresh
And follow Antoinette as I do the Kick Step

Shake, rattle & roll

(Knock em out, come on girl, knock em out
Knock em out)

Shake, rattle & roll

(Knock em out, come on girl, knock em out
Knock em out)

[ VERSE 3: Antoinette ]
(Ready?) I'm ready as I'll ever be
I use deodorant, but some still sweat me
But I stay calm with a smooth tone
Hurry quick, buy a tombstone
Cause playin is somethin that I don't do
Make my day, why won't you?
I'm the host, but this ain't a game show
That only takes place over the rainbow
I chase chuckwagons, let's get so
You're like my pet, so play petro
Save Chuck for the wagon, it fits
Amongst all the pieces of kibbles and bits
Cause I'm good (ahh) to the last drop
Of course, I just can't stop
And stardom is where I'm destined
In this profession, yup, I'm the best in
You're still riffin? Yo, bank that
Hit the side door before I spank that
Stop scrappin, huffin and puffin
Sorry, Sally, you ain't sayin nothin
Much, you can't school this
And if you thought so, that's quite foolish
So remember, don't try to play bold
You half-step to Antoinette, you shake, rattle & roll

(Knock em out, come on girl, knock em out
Knock em out)

Shake, rattle & roll

(Knock em out, come on girl, knock em out
Knock em out)

Shake, rattle & roll

(Knock em out, come on girl, knock em out
Knock em out)

Shake, rattle & roll

(Knock em out, come on girl, knock em out
Knock em out)

(Knock em out
Come on, knock em out
Knock em out
Knock em out
Come on girl, knock em out)
