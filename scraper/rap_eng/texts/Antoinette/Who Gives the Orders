(Now get up!)

I ain't a fighter, but damn, I'ma beat it up
Don't get me started, cause yo, when I heat it up
I drop rhymes causin a earthquake
Wish for your birthday, cause yo, when the earth shakes
It's catastrophic and no one can stop it
But 'nette, so another must drop it
Cause to me your weapon ain't lethal
To whom it's the sequel
Part 2, the Boss's 'Who's the Boss'
The phase of death
So make a move or call for help
Cause to me it don't mean shit
If you ain't got the punch to make the hit
So walk, set, ready, war
Went nine yards and came up short
Of 10, so just say when
Drop it - now come again
You're just paperthin and I tear ya
So don't breathe too deep cause I hear ya
And if you sissies don't wanna get inta
I break and injure and flip just like a ninja
Couldn't punch mine, so what's the punchline
Beef? Huh, you better wait for lunch, I'm
Not the one to be played
Tried to wipe the map but I stayed
Hard, cause you ain't got the bomb to drop the science
That is, you're just a menace
You must be drugged, higher than Hitler
Delirious, so why it hitcha
Cause I'm the type to walk on water
So remember 'Who's the Boss' and 'Who Gives the Orders'

Don't try to rag me, tag me and bag me
You ain't glad, so I gladly
Grant you a wish
Want it? You got it
So go 'head, scram, jet, beat it
You ain't got what it takes, but you need it
To t-o-p A-n-t, yeah, m-e
So break a leg and get hip to what's playin
A rapper shows he can dig what I'm sayin
Or once again we can go head up
And you'll be hearing (now get up!)
Cause I ain't got the time of day to joke
Don't even Lyte up cause I don't smoke
But I'm serious as a heart attack
Run it back
