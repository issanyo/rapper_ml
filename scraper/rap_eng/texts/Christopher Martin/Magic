[Verse 1]
I can see that your hair's well done
Don't tell me that you're coming from the hair salon
You know that's a no no... girl
Yea, that's a no no
You call my phone when your man's at home
What's going on? Is the respect gone?
You know thats a no no, girl
Girl that's a no no (whooaaa)

[Pre-Chorus]
You go mess around and let him find out
What we doing, doing, doing
You say you nuh care cause him have other gyal weh him screwing
(Screwing, screwing, screwing)
So you say lay down pon the bed nuh please
See you crawling to me pon yuh knees
Say you ago gi me everyting me need
Watch you slip it cross and me just slip it in

[Chorus]
You grip the sheets and broke off your nails
Sweat out your hair, baby
Call yuh job and tell your boss say yuh sick
Cause I've got you hooked on my magic

You tell yuh friend say you don't feel right
Cah you wah we lock down and fuk all night
Baby, tell you man you gone pon business trip
Cause I've got you hooked on my magic

[Hook]
You can't get enough, no
You can't get enough
You can't get enough, no
You can't get enough

[Verse 2]
We don't talk in the days when we see each other
But we come alive in the night when we're alone together
This thing we got is good
Let's keep it under cover
Just gwaan like you don't know me, you don't know me
Me don't know you, me don't know you

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel so good to be wrong
Can we leave me and you to go home
You're the melody to my song
?

[Chorus]
You grip the sheets and broke off your nails
Sweat out your hair, baby
Call yuh job and tell your boss say yuh sick
Cause I've got you hooked on my magic

You tell yuh friend say you don't feel right
Cah you wah we lock down and fuk all night
Baby, tell you man you gone pon business trip
Cause I've got you hooked on my magic

[Hook]
You can't get enough, no
You can't get enough
You can't get enough, no
You can't get enough

[Bridge]
Baby grin on me, grin on me
Grin on me, grin on me
Love me, love me, baby
Baby grin on me, grin on me
Grin on me, grin on me
Love me, love me, baby

[Chorus]
You grip the sheets and broke off your nails
Sweat out your hair, baby
Call yuh job and tell your boss say yuh sick
Cause I've got you hooked on my magic

You tell yuh friend say you don't feel right
Cah you wah we lock down and fuk all night
Baby, tell you man you gone pon business trip
Cause I've got you hooked on my magic

[Hook]
You can't get enough, no
You can't get enough
You can't get enough, no
You can't get enough
