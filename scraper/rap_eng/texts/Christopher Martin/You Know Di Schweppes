Yo Jer, you know di Schweppes

Real life sumn man a sing 'bout
Heart of love is the art of love, you know?

[Bridge]
Kicking down the door, we nah go wait 'til dem say, "next"
Feel like Superman with that big S upon mi chest
Days when me did hungry, oh, dem days was just a test
Now we're making money, everybody know di Schweppes

[Chorus]
Yeah, you know di Schweppes

Mommy have a house, daddy, you up next
Dem a try hard fi we stress, but we know we're blessed
Plus we have history fi make, we no need no rest

Make a lifestyle change, no tell you don't wanna
'Cause if you waan good, you haffi make your nose run harder
'Cause me know your future can be brighter than the sun
So, ghetto youth, you nuh haffi go pick up no gun
And pretty girl, you nuh haffi run nobody down
You've had some bad days, but better gonna come

[Chorus]

Listen to the words weh the singer sing

[Bridge]
Kicking down the door, we nah go wait 'til dem say, "next"

Days when me did hungry, oh, dem days was just a test
Now we're making money, everybody know di Schweppes
