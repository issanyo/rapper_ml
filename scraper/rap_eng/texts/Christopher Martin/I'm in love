Everybody gather round and listen this
A true story of a girl who wants to take my chick
Mi no like it no, I couldn't belive it no... no no
Right ya now this is a chapter in mi life
Mi cyaan belive da girl really waan come tek mi wife
Mi no like it no, that's why mi a talk it yeah

It was a late sunday night and we were feeling bored
So mi and mi wife say we a go out a road
I stopped by a bar so we would have a drink
This lady at the corner gave mi wife a wink
Little did I know she was a house wrecker
A walking dead, a wife snatcher
Right in front of my face she try to take my wife
Umm I got the shake of my life and she said

[Chorus: x2]
If it's love that you looking for my girl, you in the right place at the right time, cause man no have no use no more
They only know how to give pain and no joy

But how dis gal so bright, see me and mi wife a build a ting
And wah go interrupt wi life, pity she no know it nah go
Gwaan in ya tonight, go try that with some likkle fool
But gangsta youth no tek it lite, so she nah pay mi no
Attention, a just mi wife good looks have her attention
Mi turn round fi scratch mi head and by di time mi turn back she draw closer to my wife and say

[Chorus: x2]
If it's love that you looking for my girl, you in the right place at the right time, cause man no have no use no more
They only know how to give pain and no joy

She said here is my number if you in need of loving

[Chorus: x4]
If it's love that you looking for my girl, you in the right place at the right time, cause man no have no use no more
They only know how to give pain and no joy
