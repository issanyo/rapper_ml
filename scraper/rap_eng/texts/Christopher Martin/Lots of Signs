LOTS OF SIGNS
Now when it comes to sound business
Is we that run the scene cause we fresh and green

Slang diggi diggi dong dong
Diggi diggi dong
Beenie Man and Chris Martin representing fi di ghetto gang
We nuh like it one bit yuh seet
Wha a gwaan in the street is like some war a win and peace  is always getting defeat

Mr. Martin say

Chorus
Life is one big road with a lots of sign
Signs and more signs
We got to make up our mind to face reality all the time

Verse 1
And the reality is ..the leaders stuck in dem ways
And three quarter of di country stuck on minimum wage
So we need a change
Shuffle up rearrange
Stop shipping in the guns having the streets like a range
Look how long the teachers begging a raise
Police say dem a wuk fi nuttin they are not paid to be brave
Youths dem nuh have nuh years  but dem have up dem k’s
Christian dem say revelation and the ending of days
Aye mommi and poppi a dig grave
All who have a visa say dem running away
Dem life nuh longa nice everyone is afraid
I am only singing about what I see

Chorus - repeat twice

Not some times

“Beenie Man”
Life is one big road wid a lot of signs
Di government nuh see nothing until dem see yuh nine
Open up yuh eyes you’ve been acting blind
Cause if mi mek da song yah haffi gi mi mine

So dem lay yuh off from 1999 , yuh ask dem when yuh fi come back
And dem neva gi yuh nuh time
Sen a letter  inna di mail and dem ask yuh fi resign
Cause if you fired and dem know dem nuh tell yuh , dem know dat is a crime
Dem tek away yuh pension yah have family fi mine
Di bank tek whey yuh house
Weh yuh kidz dem aggo reside
Yuh wife lef you fi di likkle man pan di side now yah end up homeless pan di gully side

Chorus- repeated twice

All di time
Di yutes dem need motivation yuh hear  mi
They really need something to believe in
Could you lead dem from devastation
Those in power always seem to deceive them
So I will take some time today to go on my knees and pray
They really need it
A little bit of kindness a day could take us a far way
There is no time
This cannot wait one more day
This is no use dying patiently
I am only singing about what  I see

CHORUS – repeat twice

Talk to dem Bulby Ahh all di time , time
