[Intro:]
Aye
I got her in my white sheets
Nothing never felt so good yet
Roll her up in my white sheets
Nothing ever smelled so good yet
Oh, in my white sheets
I got her wrapped up
I gotta wrap her up
Tonight
Tonight, oh

[Chorus:]
Kick back, relax my mind and roll away my troubles
Lay her in my white sheets I gotta get a double
Got her in my palms, she's in my hands
I will slowly caress her
No rush, let's enjoy the pleasure

[Verse 1:]
How could I abuse you?
You keep me in line
When we touch it's such a rush
You take away my mind
Don't hold back your potency
Give it all to me
I'm ready, yes I'm ready
For your intensity

[Pre Chorus:]
Nothing ever felt so good in my white sheets (white sheets)
Nothing ever looked so good in my white sheets
Some say you're bad but you feel so good in my white sheets (white sheets)
Heights that you take me to in my white sheets, yeah

[Chorus:]
Kick back, relax my mind and roll away my troubles
Lay her in my white sheets I gotta get a double
I got her in my palms, she's in my hands
I will slowly caress her
No rush, let's enjoy the pleasure

[Verse 2:]
Far too many times I've refused you
Never knew the wisdom that you'd bring to my mind
This high was hard to come by now me found you
So girl I'm always going to keep you by my side
Make me heart race and you give me such a vibe
Take me to a place
Change the way I look at life
You bring out the best in me

[Pre Chorus:]
Nothing ever felt so good in my white sheets (white sheets)
Nothing ever looked so good in my white sheets
Some say you're bad but you feel so good in my white sheets (white sheets)
Heights that you take me to in my white sheets, yeah

[Chorus:]
Kick back, relax my mind and roll away my troubles
Lay her in my white sheets I gotta get a double
Got her in my palms, she's in my hands
I will slowly caress her
No rush, lets enjoy this pleasure

Together
Together
Together
Together
Aye

[Pre Chorus:]
Nothing ever felt so good in my white sheets (white sheets)
Nothing ever looked so good in my white sheets
Some say you're bad but you look so good in my white sheets (white sheets)
Heights that you take me to in my white sheets, yeah

Nothing ever felt so good in my white sheets (white sheets)
Nothing ever looked so good in my white sheets (white sheets)
Heights that you take me to in my white sheets
Some say you're bad but you look so good in my white sheets
