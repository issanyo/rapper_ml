[Intro:]
Some days of the week will be bad days
Nothing at all nah go my way
Mi fell like give up, give up
Throw in the towel and give up
When mi work just a stress mi
A mi girl nah caress mi
Yo mi have a few spots weh mi rally back
And all a mi problem dem reff mi

[Chorus:]
So mi big up the corner shop
Big up mi lane, big up mi block
Big up any weh you can chill, hold a vibes and build
Release your stress, and relax
A mi seh big up the barber shop
Big up the ball field, weh the ballers at
Yow
Just before mi go home, a deh so mi stop
Release mi mind and relax
A mi chill spot

[Verse 1:]
Everybody have somewhere they go when they feel there's no way out
Fi laugh an chat and fi get 'bout, all a the struggles dem face throughout the day
You haffi have a home away from home
Six pack and six a drop in a domino
Sing along then from you know that
You haffi have your chill spot

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Mek mi tell you 'bout spots like these
Calm you down and put your mind at ease
Work a kill you, you waan breeze
Start watch the clock, and a ramp wid your keys
And as you reach, you just free up
Hold a vibes wid your friends, and a live up
Now we all a sing along now, cause we know that
We haffi have we chill spot

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Anywhere you go to kill some time (gotta have a chill spot)
To release some pressure off your mind (off your mind)
Every evening at the same time (chilling at my chill spot)
You can find me at my spot
Chillin on my block
That why mi seh..

[Repeat Chorus]

A mi chill spot
A mi chill spot
Everbody have a chill spot
Place fi release, fi mine
Some idle time
Yo
Chill spot
Chill spot
Yeah eh eh aye
Yeah eh
