Ohho ooh ooh, oh oh ay
Aya me day yaw
Jah won't leave you for an inch, anything you want just call on him
Got a big bright smile but my days are dark
Hungry till I can barely walk, oh
Don't watch the look on my face, no, no
Doe have no food and my cupboard dry
Only God knows how I get by, oh
Don't watch the look on my face, no
She's the sweetest thing that you've ever seen
Selling her body wasn't in her dreams, no
Don't watch the look on her face, Lord
Nor because we have a pleasant look
If you nor know the story don't judge the book
Please don't, don't watch the look on my face
Even though I smile, it is only for a while
Tears could fill the river Nile
But I sweep my troubles underneath my pride
Yes I'm gonna smile, though its only for a while
Till my worries subside
I will sweep my troubles underneath my pride
Aya tell you me day yaw
Jah won't leave you for an inch, anything you want just call on him
I say Aya lord, tell you me day yaw
Fren you ah look, look to him, he will never, ever leave you thick or thin
You think everything cool true me look polite
Notten nor good notten doe alright, no
Don't watch the look on my face
So when you feel like stop just don't give up
You have life so just gwan look up
Jah alone knows the look on my face
So I laugh, smile, my heart cries
No one knows the pain I feel inside
Please don't, don't watch the look on my face
Even though I smile, it is only for a while
Tears could fill the river Nile
But I'll keep my troubles underneath my pride
Yes I'm gonna smile, though its only for a while
Till my worries subside
I will sweep my troubles underneath my pride
