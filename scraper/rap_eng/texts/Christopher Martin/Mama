[Verse 2]
Mama never had it easy at times (that is why sometimes she cry)

We held on 'cause a mama's teachings
And in the scripture she place her beliefs in
Real thing, if a never mama, I wouldn't be living

So, buss a blank fi your mama
Lighter fi your mama
Selecta you better pull up da one yah fi your mama
Proud of your mama
Sing loud fi your mama
