[Intro]
Nowhere is too far...
We travel miles over lands and seas for these beauties...
These gems, these emeralds (I'm a pirate)...
These gifts to mankind
Ha
Ladies...

[Verse 1]
This is not my city, I'm just visiting
I'm just pillaging the villages
I see two pretty diamonds that I want
I know they gonna give it up
Beautiful girls are my treasure
Looting their hearts is my pleasure
I've sailed across the seven seas, yeah
But this is my territory
Hey!

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a pirate
Pirate of the Caribbean
Yeah, I'm a pirate
Pirate of the Caribbean
And I'm  as sharp as a blade anytime I crusade
I'm a pirate, pirate of the Caribbean

[Verse 2]
Mi slicker than Jack Sparrow
Mi rougher than Black Beard
A my style dem borrow
From Henry Morgan days
Out a Port Royal weh the ship dem dock
Dem know a trouble from the sails dem black
Worst when dem see the skull and bones pon that
From the gyal dem hot, man a go launch an attack

[Chorus]
I'm a pirate
A pirate of the Caribbean, mmm
I'm a pirate
A pirate of the Caribbean, yeah
And I'm  as sharp as a blade anytime I crusade
I'm a pirate, a pirate of the Caribbean

[Verse 3]
Oooh yeah
I've sailed across on the seven seas, ooh
Mi riches go to infinity (Oh, my riches go!)
All these girls are in love with me!
My crew will never switch (never, ever!)
I'm the captain of this!

[Chorus]
So, I'm a pirate
Pirate of the Caribbean, (can't you see?!)
I'm a pirate
Pirate of the Caribbean, yeah
And I'm  as sharp as a blade anytime I crusade
I'm a pirate, pirate of the Caribbean

[Outro]
Hey!

Pirate of...
Ooooh ooh

Pirate of...
Woo woo woo

As a blade
Anytime
