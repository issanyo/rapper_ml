L-O-V-E (love) ohhh ohhh
See when you find that special person; you need to let them know how special they are
Acknowledge then everyday
Wo wo woo

Baby Ive been wondering
For having you so alone
In my life you made a statement
Youre like my very first hit song
All this time, I have been rising
But you have made me into a star
And without your love Im nothing
Who I am now is who u are

I would climb the highest mountain, yes Id do it (ah huh)
Give me any sea or ocean; Id swim through it (yea yea)
Just to prove to you my love is never ending (no nooo)
An eternity with you, Ill be spending (soo baby!)

[Chorus]
Take my love, take it all
My everything I give it to you
Please take full control, of my heart (baby)
Take my love, take it all
My everything I give it to you
Please take full control
[Take my wings and fly away 4x] (ay ay ay ay)

See baby, when Im alone with you
It feels incredible, so magnificent and unforgettable
The little things you say, they take my breath away
Every second, every minute, every given day
Youll bare a son for me; Ill give ah daughter to you
Cause for you baby, there is nothing that I wouldn't do
Just to prove my love, Id put no other above

So take my wings and fly fly fly, fly away
Across the open sky
Whether night or whether day
Take my wings and fly, fly away
Across the open sky
Whether night or whether day

Baby take my love, take it all
My everything I give it to you
Please take full control of my heart (baby)
Baby take my love, take it all
My everything I give it to you
Please take full control
Take my wings and fly away

[Chorus]
