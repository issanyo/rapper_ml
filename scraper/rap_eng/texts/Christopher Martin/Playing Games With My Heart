Oh what a la la
Sounds and pressure
Oh my lord my lord my lord

I can't believe it
Woke up out the blues said that she's leaving
I don't think she's too concern about my feelings

Girl keep playing dangerous games with my heart

She must be skeeming.skeeming
Always checking the phone hides when she's speaking
She ain't giving it up too much
She always sleeping

And keep playing dangerous games with my heart

Now we've seen better days
Far more better nights
Use to whip out roses
Blow out candle lights
Only memories of finer days
Now all am getting is your crappy ways
Oh no... oh no

Oh you can't tell me nothing
The facts remain the same
Since I ain't getting your loving
Who's sparking your flames

I can't believe it
Woke up out the blues said that she's leaving
I don't think she's too concern about my feelings

Girl keep playing dangerous games with my heart
My heart. my heart.yeahhh

She must be skeeming.skeeming
Always checking the phone hides when she's speaking
She ain't giving it up too much
She always sleeping

And keep playing dangerous games with my heart

Baby I love you
That much I do
You're my weakness
Don't play me for a fool
And I've giving you a lot as well
So why you putting me thru living hell
Oh no... Oh no...

Oh you can't tell me nothing
The facts remain the same
Since I ain't getting your loving
Who should I give the blame

I can't believe it
Woke up out the blues said that she's leaving
I don't think she's too concern about my feelings

Girl keep playing dangerous games with my heart
My heart

I can't believe it
Woke up out the blues said that she's leaving
I don't think she's too concern about my feelings

Girl keep playing dangerous games with my heart
