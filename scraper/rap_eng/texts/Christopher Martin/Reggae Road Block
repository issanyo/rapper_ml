What is happening yea
No one seems to have a care
A just pure niceness in the air yea
This a the party a the year

Mi seh Reggae road
Play the beats, pop the streets
So mi seh hey, it's a Reggae road
Feel the vibes as it comes alive
And I know it's a Reggae road
Play the beats, pop the streets
And I seh hey, it's a Reggae road
Feel the vibes as it comes alive
(1)
And I know people dancing everywhere
The big bad sounds string up in the square
Love is in the atmosphere
No bad vibes cyaa creep in here
Look how the road full a intensity
Watch the girl dem a bubble wid a energy
Lord the place full a positivity
And every man a hold a woman
What a Joy fi si
(Repeat )
(2)
No slowing down
Take it from the top
Gyal a wine up when Dancehall drop
Rnb long side some Hip Hop
Every big tune a play inna this Reggae road block
Hey music a play and soup a bubble inna pot
Liquor just a flow from the bar none stop
Hey no where to go yah so a yo chill spot
Party wid me in this Reggae road
(Repeat 2X)
