[Chorus: Gentleman & Christoper Martin]
We can make it if we try
Only if we try
Hold your head up hold it high
Got to hold it high
Journey on that never stop
We can make it to the top
We can make it to the top
Ain't no turning back

[Verse 1: Gentleman & Christoper Martin]
What we need is unification
We got to find some motivation
Set side in your destination
Be more precise with your estimation

Put your hands up on the price now
Now it's time we organize now
Elevate you're on the rise now
We are the element of surprise now

[Chorus: Gentleman & Christoper Martin]
We can make it if we try
Only if we try
Hold your head up hold it high
Got to hold it high
Journey on that never stop
We can make it to the top
We can make it to the top
Ain't no turning back

[Verse 2: Gentleman & Christoper Martin]
Hold on for a minute
Cause the sky is the limit
Hold on firm and you win it
Don't be a mimmick
So dem can't come gimmick
When damn out you are in it

Read between the lines dem
Watch we design then
Nuff a dem lost and dem say we fi find dem
Nuff a dem a devil so you know we nuh join dem
Have a bag a talk and no meaning behind dem

[Chorus: Gentleman & Christoper Martin]
We can make it if we try
Only if we try
Hold your head up hold it high
Got to hold it high
Journey on that never stop
We can make it to the top
We can make it to the top
Ain't no turning back

[Bridge: Gentleman & Christoper Martin]]
Find a way to hold your faith
Even when dem underrate
Don't you dare to hesitate
Time to communicate
Don't you ever wait to late
You got so much at stake
Sometimes you give and take
No reason to debate

[Chorus: Gentleman & Christoper Martin]
We can make it if we try
Only if we try
Hold your head up hold it high
Got to hold it high
Journey on that never stop
We can make it to the top
We can make it to the top
Ain't no turning back

[Verse 3: Gentleman & Christoper Martin]
What we need is unification
We got to find some motivation
Set side in your destination
Be more precise with your estimation
Put your hands up on the price now
Now it's time we organize now
Elevate you're on the rise now
We are the element of surprise now

[Chorus: Gentleman & Christoper Martin]
We can make it if we try
Only if we try
Hold your head up hold it high
Got to hold it high
Journey on that never stop
We can make it to the top
We can make it to the top
Ain't no turning back

We can make it if we try
Only if we try
Hold your head up hold it high
Got to hold it high
Journey on that never stop
We can make it to the top
We can make it to the top
Ain't no turning back
