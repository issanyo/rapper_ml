[Intro]
If you think I don't love you enough
Think that I've lost my touch
Know say me love you, baby
Me love you, baby

[Chorus]
Baby, I love you, my darling
Ooh, I love you girl
Baby, I need you my darling
You complete my world
Say, that I love you my darling
Ooh, I love you girl
Baby, I need you my darling
Girl, you rock my world

[Verse 1]
Every morning when I wake up I need to see your face
Every evening when I come home I need you in my space
Every night, ooh baby, I need you on my pillow
I'll never leave you, girl
Anywhere you go I'll follow

[Chorus]
Baby, I love you, my darling
Ooh, I love you girl
Baby, I need you my darling
You complete my world
Say, that I love you my darling
Ooh, I love you girl
Baby, I need you my darling
Girl, you rock my world

[Verse 2]
Girl, I'll lock you up inside my thoughts, prisoner in my mind
And I never plan to let you go, you're one of a kind
You discover feelings that I thought were locked inside
And a love like this, that is so hard to find
Gotta keep it for all time

[Chorus]
Baby, I love you, my darling
Ooh, I love you girl
Baby, I need you my darling
You complete my world
Say, that I love you my darling
Ooh, I love you girl
Baby, I need you my darling
Girl, you rock my world

[Verse 3]
'Cause I love you and I need you
You know this is true
'Cause I love you and I need you
No one else will do
'Cause I love you and I need you
Ooh, you know this is true
I love you, I need you
Need you, I love you
No one else will do

[Chorus]
Baby, I love you, my darling
Ooh, I love you girl
Baby, I need you my darling
You complete my world
Say, that I love you my darling
Ooh, I love you girl
Baby, I need you my darling
Girl, you rock my world

[Outro]
My world
You rock my world
Ooh wee, girl
You rock my world
Oh, I need you, love you
Need you in my world...
