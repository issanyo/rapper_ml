[Intro: Chip]
Hey pass my drink fam
Where me spliff deh?

[Hook: Christoper Martin]
We gonna fly tonight
We getting high tonight
Baby, we gonna make love
Under the influence
Making love under the influence
The loving turn up
Under the influence
Baby, what an experience

[Verse 1: Christopher Martin]
Have you ever done it in a plane
30,000 ft. above the clouds
I can see the rain
Screaming out so loud
I think the angels hear my name
Giving you this pleasure while I'm taking away your pain
You can't complain

[Chorus: Christopher Martin]
We gonna make love
Under the influence
Making love under the influence
The loving turn up
Under the influence
Baby, what an experience

[Verse 2: Chip]
Have you ever done it in a park
Make it very clear you can get it everywhere
Whether daylight or in the dark (Anytime)
So done with the shy ting
Me know you wan fi try things
Exploring your body arc (Sexhibition)
Kiss and unclip your bra, yeah I can multitask
I got one body touching three body parts
In her mind and her pum pum and I am in heart
Straight automatic how I swerve all up in it
Under the influence but over the limit
I don't wanna fuck no other women
You've got that something I need, bring it
Would you let me smoke my high grade and hit it from the back
Would you say I'm too wild if I said it on a track
Look I want you on your front, look I want you on your back
Love di verse, pull it back, yeah

[Verse 3: Christopher Martin]
Touch down, have you ever done it in a yacht
Seas so rough, the waves are high
But you still nuh waan mi fi stop
Begging me to give you girl
Girl you telling me to give you, give you everything I got
Look in my eyes I got you hypnotised
I know I hit the spot
I'm in the spot

[Chorus: Christopher Martin]
We gonna make love
Under the influence
Making love under the influence
The loving turn up
Under the influence
Baby, what an experience

[Outro: Chip]
Under The Influence, yeah
Knowing the drinks and the vibes is running
Chris Martin
