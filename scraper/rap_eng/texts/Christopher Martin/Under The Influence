Just me and you girl
We getting high tonight
Baby

[Chorus:]
We gonna make love
Under the influence
Making love under the influence, yeah
The loving turn up
Under the influence
Baby what an experience

[Verse 1:]
Have you ever done it in a plane
30,000 feet above the clouds
I can see the rain
Screaming out so loud
I think the angels heard my name
Giving you this pleasure while I'm taking away your pain
You can't complain

[Chorus:]
We gonna make love
Under the influence
Making love under the influence, yeah
The loving turn up
Under the influence
Baby what an experience

[Verse 2:]
Girl your mine, all mine
You're the only one onboard this private flight of mine
Up and down a roller coaster ride tonight
This turbulence
Skies are rough
But ainâ€™t no one disturbing us
What a rush

[Chorus:]
While we making love
Under the influence
Making love under the influence, yeah
The loving turn up
Under the influence
Baby what an experience

[Verse 3:]
Touch down have you ever done it in a yacht
Seas so rough, the waves are high
But you still nuh waan mi fi stop
Begging me to give you girl
Girl you telling me to give you, give you
Everything I got
Look in my eyes I got you hypnotize
I know I hit the spot
I'm in the spot

[Chorus:]
We gonna make love
Under the influence
Making love under the influence, yeah
The loving turn up
Under the influence
Baby what an experience
