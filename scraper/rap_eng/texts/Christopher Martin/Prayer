[Intro]
Ok
Rvssian, you know we might pray for a little bit of vanity
But you know we nah lef' out we friends and we family!

[Chorus]
'Cause I was not born to stay poor
No, no, no, no, no
Noo
And I dont want to live like this no more
No, no, no, no, no
So on my knees today
Lord, I pray
Where there's a will, there's a way
Lord, you can see
My mind is clean and my heart is pure
I've seen you open many doors
Keep open one for me
And my family
Oh yes

[Verse 1]
Oh
Lord I know I won't get off my knees
And everything I ask for will be granted
But while am working protect me from the enemys
They wanna see me stranded
Dem waan mi tan inna the gutter
Dem no waan mi mama eat a proper supper
Your my sword and shield
My blessings mi a go fa
Oh

[Chorus]
'Cause I was not born to stay poor
No, no, no, no, no
Noo
And I dont want to live like this no more
No, no, no, no, no
So on my knees today
Lord, I pray
Where there's a will, there's a way
Lord, you can see
My mind is clean and my heart is pure
I've seen you open many doors
Keep open one for me
And my family
Oh yes

[Verse 2]
Foreign cars and a house on the hill
With a nice little pool fi go chill
And a loyal girl on the side forever
I want it all, my mama deserves the best
So you know I couldn't settle for less
They say, "life is good"
I want mine's to be better, better
Uh

[Outro]
'Cause I was not born to stay poor
No, no, no, no, no
Noo...
