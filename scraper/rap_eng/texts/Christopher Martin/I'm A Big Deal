[Verse 1]
This has nothing to do with money, or fame, or vanity
This one is all about self worth
So, big up your chest and stand proud and donâ€™t matter 'bout nobody
No man nuh more than no man pon this earth
So whether you walk, or you a drive car
Nuh matter if you're white, or black like tar
From you feel good inna yourself you a star
Push up unuh hand and tell all the haters

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2]
It's like you have the prime minister, and then you have we
That a the order inna fi we country
Yes, that a the status of the hierarchy
Ask anybody 'bout it
4.0 a the grade point average
And we never cheat nor copy fi get it
You know you have your dreams and nobody cyan stop it
Just walk out, buss a blank, and say

[Repeat Chorus]

[Repeat Verse 1]
