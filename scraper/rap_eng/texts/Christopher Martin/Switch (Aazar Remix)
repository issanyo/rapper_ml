[Intro: Iggy Azalea]
What you want
Look, look

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Kick in the door, wavin' the four fizzy
They already know they can't fuck with Iggy
True's cost more than the rent do, you know that
All black on when I come through, it's Kodak
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Is Iggy the ziggy-iggy the baddest of 'em all?
Why you come through, shut down the mall?
All that ass deserve an applause

[Pre-Chorus: Anitta]
Change the game
Switchin' up the game
There I go again
Play your role, play you ro-o-ole
Fantasy
Turns reality
Right in front of me
I can have it anyway I want

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch!
This is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get
Red light, yellow light, green (here we go, here we go)

[Post-Chorus]
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Switch, switch, switch, switch

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Me and my boo on a worldwide hustle
You know what it is when I flex that muscle
I don't even know what a real one do
Talk that talk, I can back it up too
Got yo dessert, call me the waiter
I'm flirtin', you get it later
You could get it from the inside out
No hands, you could put it in your mouth

[Pre-Chorus: Anitta]
Change the game
Switchin' up the game
There I go again
Play your role, play you ro-o-ole
Fantasy
Turns reality
Right in front of me
I can have it anyway I want

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch!
This is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get
Red light, yellow light, green (here we go, here we go)

[Post-Chorus]
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Switch, switch, switch, switch

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Switch it up, the Lamb, the Bentley truck
He don't love you, that ring ain't big enough
If they talkin' that money I'm showing up
My account getting bigger, it's growing up
And I'm still a ma'fuckin' rockstar
Popstar but I roll with the mobsters
Yacht club on the shore eating lobster
While I'm stunting in Geneva with my top off

[Outro: Iggy Azalea & Anitta]
Red light, yellow light, green light
This is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't
Red light, yellow light, green light
