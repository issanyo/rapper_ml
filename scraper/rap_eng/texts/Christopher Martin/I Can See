[Intro]
Special selection
Fi all the girls who donâ€™t feel appreciated
Him miss your birthday and him never wish you belated
This one's for you

[Verse 1]
You've never felt warm in Christmas
Never been someone's Valentine
You've never felt a tender touch as soft as mine
Never been surprised on your birthday
Your ex, he wasn't so kind
He had an angel in his life
He was so blind

[Chorus]
But I can see, you and me, girl
Loving each other for eternity!
Endlessly close to me, girl
Feels like this was meant to be

[Bridge]
Ooooh
And I'm gonna show you
What I'm gonna do to you
Oooh yeah, baby
Ooooh!
You're the only harmony for the melody
Oooh
That I'm singing

[Chorus]
But I can see, you and me, girl
Loving each other for eternity!
Endlessly close to me, girl
Feels like this was meant to be

[Verse 1]
You've never felt warm in Christmas
Never been someone's Valentine
You've never felt a tender touch as soft as mine
Never been surprised on your birthday
Your ex, he wasn't so kind
He had an angel in his life
He was so blind

[Chorus: (2x)]
But I can see, you and me, girl
Loving each other for eternity!
Endlessly close to me, girl
Feels like this was meant to be
