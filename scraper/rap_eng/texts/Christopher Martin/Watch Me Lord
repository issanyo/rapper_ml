As I walk through the Valley of the Shadows of Death
I'll fear no evil, Thy rod and staff they comfort me
I'm not worried about tomorrow
My life is in His hands
And I'm not worried about my sorrows
I'm here at His command
Gives me strength when I need it
Supply out weighs demand
So when I call upon His name
I know my life won't be the same
Oh protect me from my friends oh Lord, and I will watch my foes
Those who wanna eat upon my flesh, protect me from those foes
Here I am at Your service, oh almighty God
And if I call upon Your name I know my life won't be the same
Noooooo
Watch me Lord in my time of need (Watch me Lord)
Watch me Lord and increase my speed (Watch me Lord)
Watch me Lord in my time of need (Watch me Lord)
I beg You watch me Lord today
Without You there's no other way, ooh
Tomorrow is not promised, right now it's very sure
So while I'm living at this moment, my actions must be pure
Help me through all my trials, so on this journey I'll endure
So when I call upon Your name, I know my life won't be the same
So with a clean heart, and a pure mind
So pure roots from a pure vine
Trod the earth with a clean mind
I know my soul be fine
Ooh
Watch me Lord in my time of need (Watch me Lord)
Watch me Lord nuh mek dem cut my speed (Watch me Lord)
Watch me Lord in my time of need (Watch me Lord)
I beg You watch me Lord today
Without You there's no other way, no, no, no
Watch me lord in my time of need (Watch me Lord)
Watch me lord and increase my spead (Watch me Lord)
Watch me lord in my time of need (Watch me Lord)
I beg You watch me Lord today without you there's not other way
Oh no
As I walk through the Valley of the Shadows of Death
I'll fear no evil, no, no, no, no
See as I walk through the Valley of the Shadows of Death
I'll fear no evil, oh no
Cause You
Watch me Lord in my time of need (Watch me Lord)
Watch me Lord nuh mek dem cut my speed (Watch me Lord)
