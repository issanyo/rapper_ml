Chorus:
Who cares what they say
I'm here for you always
I'm easy to find
Call me anytime
I'm here for you all day

[Verse:]:
How can I make you understand
All your friends are jealous cause I
I got your name in all my plans
Your the one I want in my life
I'm the man for you
Stand and fight for you
Got my heart, from the start
No one else but you
I know you wanna take that chance
Though your friends keep holding you back
Your body needs a romance
Let me give you all that I got
I'm the one for you
What you wanna do
Got my heart from the start

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2:]:
(Listen up girl)
Baby you can have my name
With these vows we'll never ever part
Or you can bear the shame
I'm removing cupid's arrow from my heart
I"m the man for you
Stand and fight for you
Got my heart from the start
No one else but you
I'd rather let you have your way
Before I make a fool out of myself
What else is there to say?
I'm in pain oh baby can't you tell
I'm the one for you
What you wanna do
Got my heart, from the start

Repeat Chorus

Bridge:(x2)
Who cares what they all say(I don't care)
I'm here for you always(I will be here)
I'm easy to find
Call me anytime
I'm here for you all day

Repeat Chorus
