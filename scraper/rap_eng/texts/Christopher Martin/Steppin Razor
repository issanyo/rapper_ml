[Intro: People in a club]
How does he do it?
What are they talking about?
I don't know, but they look so involved
Wanna go over there?
Yeah, let's go over there

Yo, me nuh know how him do it, enuh blood, but it's a vibe!!!

[Verse 1]
Oh!
They're trying to figure out just how I do it
And from the corner of their eyes, they watch me through it
And why as soon as I arrive a room full of girls get energized
They can fathom in their minds why girls flock to mi every time

[Chorus]
I'm like a walking razor, don't you watch my size
I'm dangerous, dangerous
Yeah, man a stepping razor, girls love my style
I'm dangerous, dangerous
They get addicted to my vibe
I make them feel so good inside
Intoxicated by my smile
These girls fall in no time

A tell you they love my company
Now ladies love to be next to me
If they are down and I'm around
I am the remedy
Always in their memories
I get dem smiling from the start
Self-esteem blows through the charts
And compliments start flying
I'm not even trying
But I always win their hearts

I'm like a walking razor
Don't you watch my size
I'm dangerous, dangerous
Yeah man, a stepping razor
Girls love my size
I'm dangerous, dangerous

They get addicted to my vibe
I make dem feel so good inside
Intoxicated by my smile
These girls falling every time

I'm dangerous, oh yeah, they know it
Girls love me for me and they show it
I'm dangerous, speeding bullet
Party no nice until we pass through it
I'm dangerous, check my file
Bring out my history, scan my profile
Girls are drawn to mi all the while
My style it wicked, it wicked, it wicked, hey

I'm like a walking razor
Don't you watch my size
Dangerous, dangerous
Yeah man, a stepping razor
Girls love my style
I'm dangerous, dangerous

Yeah, they're addicted to my vibe
I make dem feel so good inside
Intoxicated by my smile
They're falling every time

So very dangerous, oh, oh, yeah-eh
Addicted to my smile

Walking razor, very dangerous, oh
Stepping razor and I'm dangerous
Speeding bullet

And they're addicted to my very smile
