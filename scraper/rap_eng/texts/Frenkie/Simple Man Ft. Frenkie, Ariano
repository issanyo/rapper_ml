[Chorus: Ariano]

Im a simple man whos trying to find peace
But everywhere on this earth the devil stares at me


[Verse 1: Spinz]

They wear time on there sleeves and watch the clock tick past
Still sad that most cats are attached to trash
I'm past the rap critics and trash rap mags
Past the trash talk put it in a bag like glad
Pass me the dro snatch a beat let it go
Pass me the mic zep gotta let em all know
Flows from the soul past the heart through the blood
Flows they all know one year before the albums done
Past the watching eyes the sagas begun
Couldn't wait to penetrate they holler, underground
Industry screams rape,been fucked before but that's all in the past
We in a class of our own,on a global scale
Like fairy tales never quite came true
Thats why we grind in these times you see it right in front of you
All eyes on the prize
Im past that

[Chorus: Ariano]

Im a simple man whos trying to find peace
But everywhere on this earth the devil stares at me

[Verse 2: Frenkie]
Samo smrtvom repcugom mogu izbjec sranje
Jer gdje god da dodjem svugdje je isto stanje
Socijala je normala, drustvo bez morala
Ti ne jebes zakon tebe ne jebe vlada
Glup nosi kravatu pametan je klosar
Bosanski kosmar kako preziviti jos dan
Krvivi vrijednosni sistem ljude steze kao prsten
Zube stisnem da ne prsnem
Materijalizam i jak nacionalizam
To je sve care sto od ove drzave imam
Snagu mi daju samo bog i islam
Da se stim borim kao hrabar partizan
Gdje god bio drug, sjever ili jug
Ista ti je prica i sve je to isti krug
Ako nes biti lud moras biti grub
Moras znat borit se i pokazat zub

[Chorus: Ariano]

Im a simple man whos trying to find peace
But everywhere on this earth the devil stares at me


[Verse 3: Ariano]
Lord knows im an angel trying to find wings
Sometimes i feel strangled thats when I try and sing
I sing for love I sing for faith
And everything above,I rap for the love
Its true i feel so selfish and its true i feel so helpless without you
Homie I lose my way I go astray so to you I pray
I stay on stage until I elevate
Walk over beats like jehovah hovas a lake
Fuck the police and duck from the mace
Dont trust the t.v. get free from the hate
Pick up a book and look it in the face
Without knowledge we are nothing but a dumb fucking race
This is for the hustlers with a gun in your waist
If your gonna pull it out aim and dont wait

[Chorus: Ariano]

Im a simple man whos trying to find peace
But everywhere on this earth the devil stares at me
