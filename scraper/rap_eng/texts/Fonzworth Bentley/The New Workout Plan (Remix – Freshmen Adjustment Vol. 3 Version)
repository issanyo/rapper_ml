[Kanye West]
You just popped in the Lil Jon remix of "The Workout Plan", and
And 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
And here come the 5 to the 7 and 6
I dropped out of college, I can't count worth shit
When the album dropped I was dissing this
Now everybody know this the shit
Part 2, this the update
First rule: stay away from the cupcakes
The second rule is so underrated
They claim the song was so degradin'
"But shit it's still my favorite
And he ain't talkin' 'bout me though"
Hello, then who I'm talking about, people?
OK, whatever you want to believe though
And I even took my own advice
This gut ain't nothing these hoes gon' like
I said, I look like LL
Took my shirt off, sheclaimed "I can't tell"
But never said I can't sell
Pat, where we at, 3 mil?
Who the best now?
OK leave me out of it
Tell me who the rest now?

[Verse 2: Twista]
What ‘Sup Lil mama [?]
They call me the twista, now work that Motha'Fucka
But not to hard, baby you can do what you do
Cause i like a fat ass, but [1?]
So, if you could drop it to the floor go and [?]
So, its crush time, Shawty show me you can do so
Gon’ Work it, put down the philly steaks
[?]
I know you love how my lexus ride
But get them with them legs, don’t flex them thighs
You know want it, don’t testify
Try my New Workout Plan called Sex-ercise
That’s real
[Singing]
You don’t wanna go a day without me
She don’t really wanna lay without me
I know you love when i’m workin' it in now, baby we can work it out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Farnsworth Bentley]
B-E-N-T-L-E-Y
Yee ain't know, you betta ask somebody
What we gonna do is twirk that body
All day at they fitness party
Lock them doors, don't tell nobody
Gentlemens in the Gentlemen's Club
And hitting them with an interesting dub
It's upside down that for the A-Town
What...y'all...sayin?
F.J. Bentley caught misbehaving
Yes I'm the captain and I'm saving, all my money
Yes I'm just gonna...stand...and watch you dance from over here
Matter fact pass the Couvorsier
But I will walk you to your car my dear
Cheers

[Outro: Luke]
Work it out, work it out, girl
