[Intro]
Boosie Bad Azz
Come roll with a real nigga
I got you

[Hook]
Let me ease your mind
Bring you in my world
Cause you done caught my eye
And you can be my baby girl

[Verse 1]
What's up, girl? How you doing?
What's up with them draws, girl?
Can I get into them?
I'm looking for somebody
Who gonna be somebody
Mind made up to be a lawyer
So she gonna be somebody
She got problems and she say
"Sex ain't the only way to solve 'em"
But let's solve 'em
Let's jump in my Bentley
And cruise the city with the lights low
Go to the boat and blow some stacks
And let the dice roll

[Hook]

[Bridge]
It gon' be alright
(Fuck what them haters say)
It gon' be alright
Cause you can be my baby girl

[Verse 2]
I don't know what you been told but I'm a hustler
Your man ain't nothin' but a buster
Come with me tonight
Eat what you like, big boys I'm talkin' the best
When you get lonely put your head on my chest
It figures you never dealt with a nigga my type
Who make you happy, take you places, teach you game
Somethin' like your real daddy, I'm just tryna ease your mind
I'm tired of hearin' over and over all the time
She like: "Boosie, I got a boyfriend"
Well your boyfriend ain't ballin' plus he barely callin'
So, what's up? I got a plane ticket, just me and you
I'm like: "you scared?" She late, now she packin' her bags
First class is how we do it, let me cater to you
Let you shop till you drop, spend some paper on you
Whatever no matter the pleasure
It's better then you can dream of
Thug passion from a real thug

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 3]
You been on my mind all night and i can smell ya (And ya smellin right)
And girl i wanna tell ya i will let you ride
Take you on a rollercoaster wit me you know
Ridin round blowin doe just threw the city
Conversatin we laugh talkin bout da future
And da pastime (Da old days)
Good luv makin cuz its been so long since the last time
Kissin and fuckin stuck in them sheets to the bed
Eyes roll back in my head
And she go down on dat head
And this my homey lover friend
The one that i could fuck wit to the end
I got u girl them hoes ain't offen all the world
The niggas either u ain't never had a thug like me
Go tell yo people when u with its amazing

Shit you can't learn in college just be my lady i know how to treat lady

[Hook]
