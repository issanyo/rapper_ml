Headlights shinin on my dubs while I'm swervin
I keep an old pistol on my lap while I'm swervin
Just in case I have to peel a cap while I swerve
I play the 6 by 9's with the slap while I'm swervin
I gotta have the killa and the yak while I'm swervin
A four or five hunderd dollar stack big swervin
Smokin on some doesha early Monday and I been swervin since Thursday
