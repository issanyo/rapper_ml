[Chorus]
Want money, cars, flyest clothes
Anything anybody could ever want
All eyes on me so cold
Felt the spotlight when I walked through the door
Pretty girls, living fast
Everybody watching, waiting for me to crash
Know I drive right through the wall
Cus god want me to ball
Cus god want me to ball
I done been through it all
I been through it all
I done seen them come and go
I done seen them fall
I done been through it all
I done seen them come and go
I done seen them fall
God want me to ball

[Verse 1]
I dream this on my desk back in middle school
Plenty money, plenty women, pretty swimming pool
You know he want me here if cancer couldn't finish you
Look how he made me stand out when I'm in the room
I want the coup, got the wraith with the 4 G's
I want the shoes with the G's and the L-V's
It ain't a vibe, it's a bond that we got
Bullets missed, he ain't want his son shot
I really seen it all  I'm a real blood clot
Good heart so he blessing me dog, He never gone stop
God want me balling this I already know
I done seen em come and go
I done been on death row
Cross the tracks doing bad
I done hustled in front the store
Really thuggin in Milwaukee chasing bags in the snow
You already know
Facing murder charges up in court
Crayola, crayloa, so many cars in a row

[Chorus]
Want money, cars, flyest clothes
Anything anybody could ever want
All eyes on me so cold
Felt the spotlight when I walked through the door
Pretty girls, living fast
Everybody watching, waiting for me to crash
Know I drive right through the wall
Cus god want me to ball
Cus god want me to ball
I done been through it all
I been through it all
I done seen them come and go
I done seen them fall
I done been through it all
I done seen them come and go
I done seen them fall
God want me to ball


[Verse 2]
I really been through it all (No lie)
I know he want me to ball
Cus every time, he answer my call
They go to stressing me
End up double blessing me
It's like the same old recipe, he blessing me
Women sexing me, no need for texting me
They with it (ooh)
In this lifestyle they pretty (ooh)
God don't want me in the hood (naw)
He want me in the big house
Flossed out living good (Yes sir)
I want the money like Sean and Fif get
And he want me with it to that's why he let me out of prison
Got a billion dollar mind frame
And everybody think Imma crash because of my past
It's a mind thing
Imma shine the whole time frame
From the summer to the winter where the minks are for dinner
Jewel house, Boosie chips, Boosie liquor
Full house plenty kids got to feed em

[Chorus]
Want money, cars, flyest clothes
Anything anybody could ever want
All eyes on me so cold
Felt the spotlight when I walked through the door
Pretty girls, living fast
Everybody watching, waiting for me to crash
Know I drive right through the wall
Cus god want me to ball
Cus god want me to ball
I done been through it all
I been through it all
I done seen them come and go
I done seen them fall
I done been through it all
I done seen them come and go
I done seen them fall
God want me to ball
