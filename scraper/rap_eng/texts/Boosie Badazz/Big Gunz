[Intro]
Crackin nigga?
Dub C what up, nigga?
Ready to ride, nigga?
You know I'm ready, nigga
Ready to ride, nigga?
What's up, Kay Slay?

[Intro: DJ Kay Slay]
Yo what's up, fam?
You know how we do this
Rep' your region, niggas
From the South, I got Bun B, Webbie, Lil Boosie
From the East, I got Papoose, Cashmere
From the West, I got Dub C, E A Ski
Let's go, man

[WC]
We got guns, nigga
Let them niggas go, hold on

[Webbie]
I got my shit when I was twelve
Post up on [??] start raisin' hell
Dropped out of school, fam, so I had to get my cash on
Got to jackin' mothafuckas with no mask on
Trill young savage let you have it I'm the truth, bitch
I know you're strapped but you ain't gonna shoot shit
You ever step on my shoes, you must feel bullet proof
I'm shoot and blow your ass through the roof, bitch

[Lil Boosie]
.40 Glocks, 50 shots, niggas stroll around with big Glocks
Better get up on your shit, now
Pistol grip pumps, .30-30s, and Uzis
.500 magnum, that's what represent Boosie
Got that joker gun, nigga
With that commando clip
AK four seven, Rambo on my hip
I got them rusted .22s with them nickel-plated 9s
Them Desert Eagles only gotta hit you one time
Them [???] street sweepers they you off to heaven
Got that dreaded three five seven, nigga (buck)

[Chorus: Bun B]
Big guns
Big power
M1s
Sig Sauer
Berettas, Tauruses, Rugers
Smith and Wessons, Glocks, and Lugers
AKs, AR-15s, MAC-11s, and M-16s
High caliber, so why try it?
You live by it so you die by it
A mothafuckin' gun

[Papoose]
You shoot a man in his legs
You can stop him from walkin'
He can still snitch on you
You ain't stop him from talkin'
You shoot a man in his back
You can stop him from movin'
He ain't got nothin' to lose
So he don't mind losin'
He could come back and clap you
When he regain feelin'
I'd rather shoot him in his head
And stop him from livin'
It's Papoose
I heard some other places is similar
I represent New York
Mess around and I'm killin' ya

[Cashmere]
You know them East New York Boys
Love to tote them things
You better duck, home skillet
When that four fifth rings
We got 'em all
MACs, Berettas, M-16s
I was a kid on the roof
Clappin' off the machines (naw' mean?)
Now I'm older
Little more than a teen
So now I'm aimin' at your body
Shots'll rip through your spleen
Thinkin' back when I ain't had no funds (no funds)
And the only thing that helped me get money
Homey
Was them

[Chorus: Bun B]
Big guns
Big power
M1s
Sig Sauer
Berettas, Tauruses, Rugers
Smith and Wessons, Glocks, and Lugers
AKs, AR-15s, MAC-11s, and M-16s
High caliber, so why try it?
You live by it so you die by it
A mothafuckin' gun

[WC]
Who's the man with a strap in his hand?
Holdin' stolen semi-autos and contrabands
All day, every day, cause of my bullet [???]
In a six trey with my nigga Kay Slay (Kay Slay)
Fuck the law scandal
They look with they infrared scanner
Hangin' out the window
Hittin' em off with a bandana
And I can't stand a snitch
So I clean the lead
Just in case you
Bitch niggas wanna
Sing for feds

[E-A-Ski]
Yo, I get the feelin'
That you niggas hate fuckin' with us
Kay Slay be the only nigga fuckin' with us?
What's the mothafuckin' grudge for?
'Cause Big got popped out
Niggas wanna act out?
So did Pac
Nigga don't trip (Mmm)
A lot of niggas dead and fell victim of the clip
And you too
So nigga don't slip
Now listen to the hook of the song punk

[Chorus: Bun B]
Big guns
Big power
M1s
Sig Sauer
Berettas, Tauruses, Rugers
Smith and Wessons, Glocks, and Lugers
AKs, AR-15s, MAC-11s, and M-16s
High caliber, so why try it?
You live by it so you die by it
A mothafuckin' gun
