[Intro]
This the last song on the album
It's my first blues album
So I'ma dedicate this last song to the name of the album
Boosie Blues Cafe

[Chorus]
Take you to that place
Where they smoke weed and drink alone
Boosie Blues Cafe
But when the music play, they sing along

[Verse 1]
Take you to that place
Where they don't judge your race (It ain't like that in here)
The place where everybody get along (Respect)
Take you to that place (Yeah), chronic by the pound (Woo)
Liquor by the cases, man, it's goin' down
At the Boosie Blues Cafe (Hey)
Where the women on they A game, for real
'Cause the women, they be lookin' for stars, girl who you are?
I would like to, know your name
It's goin' down in this club, I'm talkin' anything
Last week I went to Follies, ooh, I miss Follies
I met a baddie, she in college (Ooh, that thing bad)
She just use Follies

[Chorus]
I met her at that place
Where they smoke weed and drink alone
Boosie Blues Cafe
But when the music play, they sing along

[Verse 2]
We can turn up (We can turn up)
Like Atlanta (Like Atlanta)
We can party (We can party)
We can gamble (We can gamble)
We can drink (Drink)
Out the bottle (Out the bottle)
We can smoke (Smoke)
We can pop it (Pop it)
You can double cup, my nigga (Like that)
You can double cup, my nigga (Like that)
We don't give a fuck, my nigga (Like that)
You can double cup, my nigga (Woo)
Nobody judge you in this place of business (Nah)
People turn they heads, stay in they business

[Chorus]
I gotta come take you to that place (You gotta come fuck with me though, for real)
Where they smoke weed and drink alone (Everybody chillin')
Boosie Blues Cafe (Uh-huh, nothin' but real G's and gangsters)
But when the music play, they sing along
(It's all word for word)
Take you to that place
Where they smoke weed and drink alone (Drink alone)
Boosie Blues Cafe (Boosie Blues Cafe, that's right)
But when the music play, they sing along
