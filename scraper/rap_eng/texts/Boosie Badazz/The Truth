[Intro]
I’m the truth
Leader
Boosie Badazz
One and only
Lot of motherfuckers can’t handle the truth
I give it to them anyway

[Hook]
You can’t handle the truth
(You’re all the way live with Boosie Badazz)
You’re in the land of the truth
(You know why the world love me, nigga? I keep it a hundred)
What I’m saying is true

[Verse 1]
The system designed to keep us all up in prison (true)
Section 8 don’t want the daddy living with the siblings (true)
They don’t want to give us job, so everybody around here stealing (true)
Probably ain’t listening ‘cause their children having children (true)
You know the world we’re living in, man, is straight wicked
They got a cure for AIDS and cancer but we can’t get it (true)
Cops shoot us down ‘cause our skin, they’re some dirty bitches
They shoot us down on camera, don’t even get convicted

[Hook]
(Talk to them Badazz, they don’t like that)
You can’t handle the truth
(You’re all the way live with that real nigga Boosie Badazz, nigga, we know where you at)
You’re in the land of the truth
(Boosie Badazz, Boosie Badazz nigga talking real shit)
What I’m saying is true
(I always keep it a hundred)
But you can’t handle the truth, you’re in the land of the truth

[Verse 2]
They already know the amount of prisoners up in prison (true)
Why the fuck you think they’re building all them private prisons (true)
Every time you turn the TV, you see gays, man (true)
Kids ain’t supposed to see this at this early age, man (true)
Hoes winning, IG, that bitch turned up (true)
But 9 times out of 10, we won’t wife her (true)
Bloods telling on their blood, this shit new to me
Niggas who fall don’t always come up ‘cause they’re always hollering used to be (that’s real shit)
Half these rappers really pussy and ain’t making money
If they came cross tha track, we’ll take it from them
Niggas beefing with each other on the IG
Hoes realer than these niggas if you ask me

[Hook]
(Sometimes, a bitch keep it more realer than your niggas)
You can’t handle the truth
(You’re all the way live with Boosie Badazz, nigga, where you at)
You’re in the land of the truth
(I got some real Boosie Badazz for you)
Know what I’m saying is true
(Pussy ass nigga)
But you can’t handle the truth, you’re in the land of the truth

[Verse 3]
From my block to your block, it’s a hurricane
Bitches left us all to die in the hurricane
Sent me straight to death row with the murder game
Turned my rap name Boosie to a murder name
Yeah it’s true I got it on me, keep that 40 for ‘em
Federal rats coming home, they’re throwing parties for ‘em
Niggas don’t even stack their money, it’s a different hustle
Niggas turning gangbangers ‘cause they like the colors

[Hook]
(It’s a different world out here, most gangbangers ain’t even gangbangers)
You can’t handle the truth
(Everybody hollering they’re real, but most fake)
You’re in the land of the truth
(Niggas stealing from their boys and shit)
Know what I’m saying is true
(Sisters fucking their sisters’ old man and shit)
But you can’t handle the truth, you’re in the land of the truth

[Outro]
Boosie Badazz
Every time you turn to me nigga, I’ma give you the truth
That’s how I last so long
I remain the truth
I’ma speak the truth on it whether you like it or not
I know most people, they can’t handle the truth
