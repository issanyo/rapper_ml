[Hook]
I’m not the menace to society

Damn look at the society
(look where they at God, Protect em God)
Another menace to society

[Verse 1]
He never knew his dad ‘cause his dad was a shooter
Before he got out pampers
Lost his daddy to some shooters
Where he grew up
Shit it wasn’t far from hell
Just playing round the house
Residue under his nails
Uncle never taught him nothing
Shit but how to put the clip in
Any questions bout to fire
I’m about to let the ripped in
Grew up seeing murder
Eight years old he was too gone
Momma selling pussy on the same corner school on
Lights went out he got cold
And he ain’t [?]
So he went by his auntie
And stole his cousin’s Mac 11
He blasted a dude
He even took the dude’s cell
Nice murder game official
And this nigga only 12

[Hook]
I’m not the menace to society
Take a look at the society
(Take a look at the society)
Another one born again
Another menace to society
(Another menace to society)
(forgive em God)
Damn look at the society
(look where they at God, Protect em God)
Another menace to society

[Verse 2]
I send this out to Ty rest in peace my lil G
Juvenile life when he was only 13
Say he killed a garbage man and a couple more
Papers red eyes momma and his daddy sell dope
So imagine what he see in all the years before this started
Plus his big brother on the body [?] bar
Game time like he was 40
18 years was his sentence
But prison made him worse
Cause in the can he was a menace
Thinking niggas tennis
Thugging shanking niggas up
Standing up to the biggest mother fucker in the cut
Let him out when he was 31  now he finally back
Got his name tatted on
It’s [?] killer black
Came home getting a sack
You in his way you getting whacked
High speed chase police killed killer black

[Hook]
I’m not the menace to society
Take a look at the society
(Take a look at the society)
Another one born again
Another menace to society
(Another menace to society)
(forgive em God)
Damn look at the society
(look where they at God, Protect em God)
Another menace to society
