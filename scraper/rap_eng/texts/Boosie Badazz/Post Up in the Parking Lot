[Hook (4x)]
I don't need no VIP, I post up in the parking lot
Parking lot, in the parking lot, post up in the parking lot

[Verse]
I don't need no VIP, I'm posted in the parking lot
Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, clutching on the 40 Glock
Thirties on my big truck, I had to get a [?]
I'm parking lot pimping, [?] and doing what I want
VIP ain't for me 'cause I don't drink, i pop ecs
Lamborghini, Beemer, Coupe, what I'm gonna drive next?
Everybody watching me, everybody want to ride with me
Ain't nobody in VIP 'cause my clique, we in the parking lot
Hanging out the window, blowing on that indo
Middle fingers up, you gon' [?] I don't know what
I can't be touched, I'm too loose for VIP
Bring our goons out here to me, man, you know how Boosie be
All this body, all this mine, in the parking lot, we shine
In the front seat, that nine, in the back seat, a dime
You looking for me, dog? No, I ain't hard to find
We be swerving in a line, choo-choo train is where we shine
