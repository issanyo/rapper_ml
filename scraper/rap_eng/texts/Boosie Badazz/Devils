[Intro: Lil Boosie]
Yeaaaaaaaaa (Devils, devils)

(Devils)

[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
Man it's payback
For all the months that I layed back
For all the blunts that had me lazy 'n' crazy
It's drama time (Time)
I'm gettin' ten for a show (Let's go!)
Album ain't even dropped
When it's dropped, I'm gettin' more
Wish I can go down every street (every street)
But the fuckin' Narcotics say I got death on me
Niggas they try to rebel me (Shiiit)
But it's motivation
I'mma keep gettin money
Go on Soulja hate me
The judge looked at me
And said how you doin' Boosie
He called me by my nickname (Ooooh)
What you think I'm stupid (Bitch)
You wanna railroad a nigga (Believe That)
And lose me in the system
But like C-Murder and Mack
I refuse to be a victim nigga

[Hook: Lil Boosie]
Devils get up off me
Devils get up off me

Devils get up off me
Devils get up off me
Devils get up off me
Devils get up off me

[Verse 2: Foxx]

Nigga tell you he gone kill you
You gone shoot or die
Them devils got them youngters wildin' out at twelve nah (Twelve)
And Hollin' mutha fuck jail they goin' to hell now (Fuck Hell)
See I'm from Baton Rouge
Better known as Rattin' Rouge (Rattin' Rouge)
The police know yo ass done it before you even do it (Believe It)
I'm so gutta, so gangsta, so in the streets (What Else?)
I'm so freaky, so nasty, so in the sheets (Believe Dat)
My cousin lifin, grandpa lifin
And niggas mandatory (Fuck)
The judge ain't nothin' but the devil
Him and the jury
I seen a nigga die in front of me
Eyes rolled back
They threw the chopper bullets at 'em (bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop)
Like hold that
