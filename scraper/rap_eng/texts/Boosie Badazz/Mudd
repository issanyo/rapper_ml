*Boosie Talking*

All wrong ain't wrong when you get it out tha mudd

[Chorus]
Tha mudd
Movin' packs up out my Granny house
Tha mudd
Every pack, I'm tryna stretch it out
Tha mudd
He play wit' mine, I gotta stretch him out
Tha mudd
Gotta keep milk up in my baby mouth
Tha mudd
Got a quota that I gotta meet
Tha mudd
Got a pot, some soda, and some fire D
I hope I win shootin' craps
It been a long day
On tha corner hustlin' everyday
I came a long way (Boosie Badazz)

[VERSE 1 - BOOSIE]
We thug in my city
We thug
I get this shit out tha mudd
I never took from tha plug
I'm loyal so now I'm tha plug
I used to walk in tha mall
I couldn't get nuthin out tha mall
This was tha mudd and tha gravy
This was tha 90s and 80s
We can't get it
We gon' steal it
GOD gon' forgive us
If he surround us wit' these dealers & these killas
A mudd man
This for my homies doin' time on that walk
I hope you give yo time back
I hope you walk nigga
Tha mudd

[BRIDGE]
When you in tha trenches wit' yo boys man
Keep a stick like Tarzan
Keep yo hittas on guard man
We thank, fuck that
We ain't dying broke
We put that on GOD man
And nigga this tha mudd

We give a shit bout tha plug
We get this shit out tha mudd
We get this shit out tha mudd
We give a fuck bout tha plug
We give a shit bout tha plug
We get this shit out tha mudd
We get this shit out tha mudd
We give a fuck bout tha plug

[VERSE 2 - YUNG BLEU]
I keep a stick like I'm Tarzan
Keep me some pounds like I'm weight liftin
Yella, Yella in my Maison Margiela's
I'm out my body
Like I'm shape shiftin'
I got some niggas that keep a automatic
Off in tha attic
I serve a pack, and skate off like a bandit
I'm in tha cut
I'm posted like a bandit
2 cups stuffed up
Fucked up, bucked up
Fuck all that other shit
Niggas want beef
And I had bout enough of this
Stick to tha code
Don't call me by my government
I saw 100 bands
Fell in love wit' it
Oh
Fell in love wit tha coke
Runnin' thru packs on tha regular
Oooh
Word on tha street
That Yung Bleu, he tha truth
I'm wit some yung niggas
We on tha loose
Choppers on deck
We pop up wit a few
I'm in tha dirty A, pop out tha roof
I'm that yung nigga that still got tha juice
Syndicate shit
U can't fuck wit tha crew
Last nigga did went missin'
U know that we don't play that dissin'
U know that we don't play that dissin'

[BRIDGE]
When you in tha trenches wit' yo boys man
Keep a stick like Tarzan
Keep yo hittas on guard man
We think, fuck that
We ain't dying broke
We put that on GOD man
And nigga this tha mudd

We give a shit bout tha plug
We get this shit out tha mudd
We get this shit out tha mudd
We give a fuck bout tha plug
We give a shit bout tha plug
We get this shit out tha mudd
We get this shit out tha mudd
We give a fuck bout tha plug
