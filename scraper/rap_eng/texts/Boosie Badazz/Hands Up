[Intro]
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer, why you shooting?
I got my hands up (my hands up), hands up (my hands up), hands up

[Verse 1]
Don't know what they gone do man today (oh lord)
A crooked cop might try to shoot me today
Plus they dudes in the system, acting like they ready for shit that they ain't ready for
Black power, they scared of us
"Just go kill a black", shot him through the windshield
Taraj want his brother back, fuck that, this shit real
Police killing kids, kids killing men
Broke and a fifth of gin'll make a nigga sin
You know you planted that shit on my homeboy
Motherfuckers gave the bench to my old boy
When shit real, your wrong ain't really wrong boy
So we clutching long toys dummy, bitch you see me coming

[Chorus]
And something telling me to stand up (I'm tired of this shit)
Why you shooting? Officer I got my hands up (police)
My hands up, but something telling me to stand up (fuck that shit)

[Verse 2]
Lord knows the evil (the evil you do)
The DA fired you hot, the friends you called so that appeal get denied
I know it's hate cause when I won they had tears in they eyes
Said it's my lawyer, no that's karma for all the niggas you fried
Seen it firsthand, and man, they ain't got feelings inside
They be wanting ya boy to testify, we know he gone die
They smiled at me, it was lucifer in front of my face
Now my nephew fighting a body, how much more can I take? (fuck that shit)

[Chorus]
And something telling me to stand up (I'm tired of this shit)
Why you shooting officer? (why you shooting?) Officer I got my hands up (police)
My hands up, but something telling me to stand up (fuck that shit, fuck that shit)

[Outro]
Rest in peace Michael Brown
Cold part about it (cold part about it)
He had his hands up (his hands up), his hands up (his hands up), his hands up (his hands up), his hands up (his hands up)
He had his hands up
Rest in peace Trayvon Martin (Trayvon, Trayvon, Trayvon)
Cold part about it, nigga shot him cause
He had on black bruh (at nighttime), black bruh
He had a hood that was black bruh
Why they do it? cause we black bruh
