[Intro]
I'ma send this song out to my baby mamas
They probably mad at me right now
It was all worth it

[Chorus]
It was all worth it (It was worth it)
Bein’ called all them names by you
It was all worth it (It was worth it)
Me tellin' lies and playin' games with you
Shawty, it was all worth it (It was worth it, it was worth it)
Gave me a baby that’s so perfect
So it was all worth it (Anything you do is worth it)
It was worth it, I deserve it

[Verse 1]
Leavin' out the club, havin' fights with you ('Member we'd be fightin' at the club?)
Fuck them other girls, I'm on a flight with you (Me and twin had some nights)
Even to this day, Trig'll fight with you (Damn, Trig)
So glad I used no rubber, the night with you (For real, Trig)
’Cause y’all gave me Ty and Tooly, too (And my lil' nigga)
We used to be so tight, now we super loose (Yeah, we used to be tight)
Told the world I wasn’t your daddy, that's how you do me, boo (That's how you do me)
I looked you in your eyes and made love to you
But it was worth it

[Chorus]
It was all worth it (It was worth it)
Bein' called all them names by you
It was all worth it (It was worth it)
Me tellin’ lies and playin' games with you
Shawty, it was all worth it (It was worth it, it was worth it)
Gave me a baby that's so perfect
So it was all worth it (Anything you do is worth it)
It was worth it, I deserve it

[Verse 2]
Cheatin' on Juanita in this life of sin
Girl, I made you strong for that man you with
Protectin' all my people in this life of sin
Say Lil Bleek, it was worth it, I'd do it again (Me or them)
It was all worth it (It was worth it)
I was out my mind (Out my mind), went to the pen (I was crazy)
But got smarter in time (Yeah)
First I said I didn't deserve it (I was like, "I ain't deserve this")
Then I came home smarter, richer, and wiser (Guess what, Mama?)
Mama, it was all worth it (It was all worth it)
All the pain God done put us through
It was all worth it (It was all, it was worth it)
'Cause look what God done did for you
This struggle, it was all worth it (My struggle, it was all worth it)
It's all good girl, you can curse me, it's worth it
Them babies worth it

[Outro]
Leavin' out the club, havin' fights with you
Fuck them other girls, I'm on a flight with you
Even to this day, just to fight with you
So glad I used no rubber, the night with you
It was worth it (It was all worth it)
You can call me all my names
Do whatever you want
When I look at them babies, huh
All this shit be worth it
When I look at them babies, I look at y'all
And I be, I be like damn, shit was worth it
Shawty, it was all worth it (Anything that happened)
You know, we can't overlap (Just to show you that you're perfect)
And she got a baby for it (Anything you do is worth it)
I won't tell you a thing, it was worth it
