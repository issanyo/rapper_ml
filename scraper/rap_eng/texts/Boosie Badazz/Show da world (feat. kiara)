I just wanna show the world
That i really do this shit
And I really make quality street music (Know what I'm talkin bout)
And It ain't no mistake that I'm this good
I just done seen singing a lot, know what I'm talkin bout
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my brother
You gotta feel this Lil' hustla
We gon' show the world
The Definition of real shit, my nigga
You gotta feel this Lil' nigga
I got my own voice (blessed)
Sing my own hooks (blessed)
Fresh fade nice smile I got my own look (fresh)
I just like to make people happy (for real)
4 kids I just like being a good dad
But I'm a gangsta and I rock shows (you ain't see my shows)
A people person so you know Lil' Boosie got hoes
Damn hoes that's a figure speech
Get a lotta shit like that when you listen to me
This for my fans I love y'all
Straight up y'all a part of me so when they hate
They hate us
Money keep a nigga going, do better things
Man I take it to the bank, I don't make it rain
But I'm fly like Weezy
Plus the hood niggas man they believe me like jeezy
And I just like to have a good time
Hit the yo smoke one and put my life in my rhymes
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my brother
You gotta feel this lil' hustla (Boosie badass)
We gon' show the world
The Definition of real shit, my nigga
You gotta feel this lil' nigga (Boosie badass)
Father forgive me I was raised on some real shit
So I can't sugar coat shit, not a lil' bit
Inside I'm sad about my dad
Since I lost my grams ain't been giving a damn
But I still hold my head high
And sometimes I cry
But when I cry man I don't know why
I feel trapped to be a superstar
100 thousand worth of jewelry to end it
And I spend it, no problems
You don't like badass then that's your problem
M.O.B wouldn't give a damn if they hoes holla
Love cars love broads with a passion
Ain't never have shit so I'm flashy
I work hard go and get it on the road
Seven month run 750 out for shows get it?
I'm hood rich still smokin' that good shit
Still got the same hood clique straight up
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my brother
You gotta feel this Lil' hustla (Boosie badass)
We gon' show the world
The Definition of real shit, my nigga
You gotta feel this Lil' nigga (Boosie badass)
I told my teacher to her eyes I'mma make it there
She ain't even look surprise gave me another F
Or a fuckin' D heaven you gotta see
Fuck the world lately, be whatever ever you wanna be
Ain't nothing like a strong mind and some confidence
Whenever you step out line it's consequence
We all overseas, we puffin' weed
We'll make you niggas bleed yes and fuckin' deed
Seven forty seven yellin' seven forty seven
On da real we gotta be a couple miles from heaven
The world tryin' pull us down we ain't fuckin' let it
I woulda did some of it different but I don't regret it
That's one thing about me though I never been a quitter
That's ? shit crazy shoutout to the hot spittas
Rest in peace ma, I'mma be on TV
Young savage Sweet Jones Trill Family
We gon' show the world
