[Hook: (2x)]
Crayola, crayola
I ride different colors every day
I ain't playin' wit deez niggas, stuntin' like baby
Niggas in the hood hollin' Boosie gon crazy

[Verse 1:]
(you might see me in a)
White challenger, white rims, white hat
Black challenger, black rims, black gat (TRY ME)
Blue challenger, blue rims, blue weed
Orange challenger, that dukes of hazard up in me
Lexus coupe, drop top so you can see
Painted candy red, bowlegged like candy red
On Sunday I be stuntin', I hop up in my Bentley
Thank the man up above for blessins he done sent me
Green charger, drop top, call it master splinter
Glocks cocked, wildin' out hangin' out the window
On Wednesdays I be chillin' but be swerv-IN
Smokin' purple in my 0-8 suburb-AN
Too many cars, ain't no room in my yard
I go low key and I can jump up in my bitch jaguar (I'm BAllIN!)
Feds follow me round, they nosy tryn'a see
But every car got tint, how you gon' know its me?

[Repeat Hook: (2x)]

[Verse 2:]
I got the lime green drop top
Can't ride it if it's too cold, can't ride it if it's too hot
That thang'll make you pop
Flat screens in our trunk we got our own movies
So you ain't gotta go to the theater, just call Boosie
And that yellow yellow on my shit
Match wit my yellow watch, girls on my dick
People don't understand how I floss like this
People like is that a cable cord round your wrist?
You know we ball on the week-END
A line of cars, bad broads tryn'a jump IN
Same color as my whip, I'm real fly
Yellow, yellow, green, green, my self esteem high
When it be rainin' man I jump in my old school
When its a game its like a train when we roll thru
Ya feel me man?
Big stacks on deck, get out the big dawg's way
I'm like, what I'm gon' drive today?
Crayola crayola

[Verse 3]
Now all through the week
I be in the street (THUGGIN)
Looking real flashy and my whip real nasty
Leave church on Sunday, jump up in my Bentley
Thank the man up above for blessins he done sent me
Now Monday I'm back stuntin', I jumped up in my Charger
The red one, the wet one, had them hoes like *hoooo* (BOOSIE)
Navigation on my whip, I can't go wrong
Candy red on that bitch, on the mirror chrome
Night time, the right time, I be swervin'
Smokin' purple in my 0-7 suburb-AN
Monte Carlo all black, this Crayola shit is real talk
And when I floss I let them birds out
Gave my momma my Corvette, that silver thang
A nice house flossed out, with some diamond rings
People in the hood like "Boosie you ignorant"
But daughter, like daddy, you sick with this
Crayola
