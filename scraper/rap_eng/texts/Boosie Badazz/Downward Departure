[Chorus: Koly P]
I hate to be the bearer of bad news
But the real the new fake and the lame the new cools
Cool, cool, cool
I hate to be the bearer of bad news
But the real the new fake and the lame the new cools
Cool, cool, cool

[Verse 1: Koly P]
You better hope your niggas livin' right
I seen a nigga take the stand and take his nigga life
He was silent like them lambs, he got sacrificed
How some shit a nigga sell can get you natural life
The judge killed him with a pen, nigga broad day
Boy them Buck Rogers years really far away
For my niggas hit Desoto, all in South Bay
Only thang they lookin' forward to is coffee cakes

[Chorus: Koly P]
They say a closed mouth don’t get fed
My nigga kept a closed mouth and went fed
Lack that loyalty and honor, boy that shit dead
I got the deposition, this is what it read (fuck nigga)
I hate to be the bearer of bad news
But the real the new fake and the lame the new cools
Cool, cool, cool (fuck nigga)

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Hate to break it to you
That loyalty shit out the door, these niggas fakin' to you
April Fools nigga
Lot of chains, tellin' names
You the new cool niggas who been fuckin’ up the game
Let me explain (talk my shit)
Get your money, duck them people, get your ball on
Trust nobody, trust nobody, it’s a war zone
I know a nigga stayed solid, he ain’t get nothing from it
'Cause his co-defendant couldn’t stay quiet
Same niggas that you grew up with
Shit click, now they wan' shoot up shit
Closed mouthes don’t get fed so they hit that lick
Rest in peace Dee Pitcher, man I miss that bitch
We used to all post up in front the store
Smokin’ on the dro
I don’t know what happened, but I really wanna know
Why you ain’t loyal no more

[Chorus: Koly P]
They say a closed mouth don’t get fed
My nigga kept a closed mouth and went fed
Lack that loyalty and honor, boy that shit dead
I got the deposition, this is what it read (fuck nigga)
They say a closed mouth don’t get fed
My nigga kept a closed mouth and went fed
Lack that loyalty and honor, boy that shit dead
When I got the deposition, this is what it read (fuck nigga)

[Verse 3: Koly P]
I know niggas doin’ time, never sold nothing
Got time off gold dope and never told nothing
My nigga from [?], he in cold money
Used to have the block hot until they froze him
Picked him out the lineup, the victim chose him
And he on his third strike so bitch it’s over
He took ‘em one to the chest, he a soldier
For my niggas in Baton Rouge and Angola

[Chorus: Koly P]
They say a closed mouth don’t get fed
My nigga kept a closed mouth and went fed
Lack that loyalty and honor, boy that shit dead
I got the deposition, this is what it read (fuck nigga)
They say a closed mouth don’t get fed
My nigga kept a closed mouth and went fed
Lack that loyalty and honor, boy that shit dead
When I got the deposition, this is what it read (fuck nigga)
I hate to be the bearer of bad news
But the real the new fake and the lame the new cools
Cool, cool, cool
I hate to be the bearer of bad news
But the real the new fake and the lame the new cools
Cool, cool, cool

[Outro: Koly P]
They say a closed mouth don’t get fed
My nigga kept a closed mouth and went fed
Lack that loyalty and honor, boy that shit dead
I got the deposition, this is what it read (fuck nigga)
They say a closed mouth don’t get fed
My nigga kept a closed mouth and went fed
Lack that loyalty and honor, boy that shit dead
I got the deposition, this is what it read (fuck nigga)
