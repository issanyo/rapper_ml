[Intro: MO3]
Ooh, Danberry
I brought Danberry to the hood early
Hood with another one
La-la, la-la, la-la
All night, yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: MO3]
I apologize, if I make you take this dick
About a thousand times, you keep tellin' me you're comin'
Well I'm right behind ya, got me jumpin' in your stomach
Tryna touch your spine, that pussy got me like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm"
The pussy got me like, "Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm"
That pussy got me like, "Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm"
That head got me like, "Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm"
Girl

[Verse 1: MO3]
I know I'm on your mind (Wha?)
I make you come, look, don't run
I don't have the time (Have the time)
All in your lungs, I go dumb
It should be a crime (Shake me down)
Lets make a movie in this bitch
I tell her press rewind (Press rewind)
I'm an untame lion, oh-oh, oh-oh (Ayy)
I go gorilla mode in the pussy
Yeah, I go gorilla, go apeshit
When I'm in gorilla mode, she be lookin'
When I'm in gorilla, don't say shit
Snuck in with the hoodie on with the glizzy
Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom, boom-boom
Bitch I'm like the cookie monster with the nookie (Ahh)
And she gon' ride me like a roller coaster
At Six Flags (At Six Flags)
Lil' mama thicker than a snicker

And got a six pack (I do)
She put that pussy on me (Put that pussy on)
No, I can't get attached (Yeah-ah)

[Chorus: MO3]
I apologize, if I make you take this dick
About a thousand times, you keep tellin' me you're comin'
Well I'm right behind ya, got me jumpin' in your stomach
Tryna touch your spine, that pussy got me like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm"
The pussy got me like, "Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm"
That pussy got me like, "Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm"
That head got me like, "Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm"

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
She say she want me right now (Right now)
She say she need me ASAP (Facts)
She say book the flight and she gon' make that (She gon' make that)
She say she 'bout to show out (Haha)
Say she can't wait to taste that
Reminded me of what we did in the Maybach
Came in and took her clothes off (All off)
And put it straight in her mouth (Damn)
Savage shit when we hit
I really turned baby out (Turned baby out)
Catch a nut and smoke one, and go again (Go again)
Another rodeo (Yay, yay)
I don't wanna talk, I wanna fuck
I'm a Scorpio (Yay, yay)
She feel it, I feel it (Yes)
She comin', I'm comin' (Yes)
She rain, I thunder, like
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Oh)
Rub my dick on her ass cheeks
In the mornin', sorry, girl, I'm horny
I apologize

[Chorus: MO3]
I apologize, if I make you take this dick
About a thousand times, you keep tellin' me you're comin'
Well I'm right behind ya, got me jumpin' in your stomach
Tryna touch your spine, that pussy got me like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm"
The pussy got me like, "Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm"
That pussy got me like, "Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm"
That head got me like, "Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm"
Girl, ooh-ooh-ooh
