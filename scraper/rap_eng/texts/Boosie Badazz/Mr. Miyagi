[Verse 1]
All I ever did was teach folk in the community
A place where ain't no loyalty, or ain't no unity
Taught you bout animosity and how to keep it gutta
Explain to you in detail why you boys don't know my struggle
This that real deal shit from a real motherfucker
My stomping ground make me a ill motherfucker
Somebody say you might not like my music cause you might get burned from it
Mr. Miyagi with this shit tho, you learned from it
It's that murder man music, it's that nigga Boosie
30 chains on his neck, look at him, that nigga stupid
He on parole but look around 'em, he got 22
I trained 20 niggas, to bust 20 Uzis
I taught 'em how to sell, how to stack they mail
When they slipped and fell, I got 'em outta jail
If that ain't real, what you call that? Came home got it all back
My line busy nigga, call back

[Hook]
Mr. Miyagi with this real shit
Mr. Miyagi with this real shit
Mr. Miyagi with this real shit
Mr. Miyagi with this real shit

[Verse 2]
I took niggas with no hustle, and made em outta G's
Ran wit like Busta and Tommy Sneed
I took care of niggas, If I was fly then they was fly with me
Wonder why a nigga couldn't sit and testify on me (keep it real)
Forget everything we did, get up and lie on me
But that ain't how I raised niggas, Mr. Miyagi!
Fuck any nigga got my back, I know God got me
They said I wasn't coming home, God watching
They say all my niggas looking like they got hard faces
Mr. Miyagi, why the fuck you think they couldn't break em?
South Baton Rouge, they was schooled by a mental patient
Cause all they had was niggas brains on the dinner table
Every every every ghetto, they look up to me
Every bad bitch in stilletos, they wanna fuck with me
If Lousiana was Atlanta, then I'm fuccin Meech
I creep wax on, wax off

[Hook]
Mr. Miyagi with this real shit
Mr. Miyagi with this real shit
Mr. Miyagi with this real shit
Mr. Miyagi with this real shit
