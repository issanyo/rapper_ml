I'm full of dat shit; I'm full of dat shit
I'm full of dat shit; I'm full of dat shit
I'm full of dat shit; I'm full of dat shit

[Webbie]
Now if you ever catch me leanin' to the side
Red eyes in my ride
With the music up high
Bad bitch up on my side
Might be gettin' on her ass so I'm grippin' on her thighs
Play me, I ain't even gon' try (I'm full of dat shit)

[Lil Boosie]
Now you might catch me wit my cutie
Ridin bumping that Boosie
One hand on the wheel, the other hand on the coochie
Big stacks, big gats, Nextel Motorola's
Doja after doja (I'm full of dat shit)

[Webbie]
In the club by the bar
My niggas, we twistin' gars
Spending pitches wit my boys
Jumping, stomping, makin noise
On the block serving junkies making money thumpin toys
I ain't in the mood for it (I'm full of dat shit)

[Lil Boosie]
We in the club throwin 4s, pourin 4s
Blowin Jos, fresh clothes
Gotta nigga head drove
V.I.P. doors is where we go when we gon' party
That ex got us retarded (ecstasy) (I'm full of dat shit)

[Webbie]
Ducked off countin' cheese with Boosie in Tennessee
Red bitches on they knees suckin and catchin semen
Wit some dark locs on the sun ain't even beaming
You ain't even tryin to see me (I'm full of dat shit)

[Lil Boosie]
I'm in the room wit something nasty big, fine, and sassy
On top that girl be actin, she even called me daddy
I hit in the Caddy on the way to the classic
I fell asleep off in traffic (I'm full of dat shit)

[Webbie]
In the room wit something sexy, caramel complexion
Both of us butt naked
Don't give it to me, I'll take it
No time for no cakin I'm stabbin it like I'm Jason
I serve it like I'm crazy (I'm full of dat shit)

[Lil Boosie]
You can catch me by the school zone
Wit my McKinley Blue on, with a tool long
That'll have you, you, you, and you gone
You niggas hatin on these boys cause we trill
And we drink all night (I'm full of dat shit)

[Webbie]
Sharp as a bow and arrow
Two deep in the Camaro
Clutchin on the double barrel
Hollin bitch it don't matter
Wit the class clown actin no sense and go get the paddle
That'll have me actin badder (I'm full of dat shit)

[Lil Boosie]
I'm in the room wit Halle Berry
I swear this girl Halle Berry
Cuz she shaved round her cherry
And she smile when she get ready
And keep wit that confetti
We ridin heavy Chevy's gettin high every second (I'm full of dat shit)

[Webbie]
On the way to the mall
Wit a bad lil broad
Slob all over my balls
She lickin through my draws
Wit my main man wit me I'm hittin up on the phone
That's my motherfuckin dog (I'm full of dat shit)

[Lil Boosie]
I hit the stage buckin hard got the whole club rockin
Hennessy and Hpnotiq got me thinkin bout the projects
Stop it that's my goal nigga
You know every time you see me I'm pourin 4s (I'm full of dat shit)

[Webbie]
Drivin on the sidewalk in the dark like I don't care
Flyin through the stop signs like them bitches wasn't there
Spinning buck up to the ceiling spilling Hennessy and beer
We done shot ya in the ear (I'm full of dat shit)

[Lil Boosie]
I'm in New Orleans wit Lil' Wayne, platinum chains, platinum women
If you tell them girls sick me then you know they gon' come and get me
They gon' rub me, they gon' lick me, they gon' keep a nigga smilin
I can't stop wylin (I'm full of dat shit)
