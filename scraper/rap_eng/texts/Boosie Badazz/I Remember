I Remember nigga
Boosie Bad Azz
I Remember nigga (2x)

[Boosie Talking]
Now I remember everything
From them cold night on the block
I remember the struggle
I remember the shine
I remember they faces when they saw me shine
Nigga I remember everything

[Verse 1 - Boosie]
Outside with no shirt (I remember nigga)
Talked loud in that church (I remember nigga)
Nigga stole all my work (I remember nigga)
Kirby took my lick in court (I remember nigga)

Them plantation days, do you remember that
The good times that we had in big digem lac
Do you remember debra proch when it was hot and steaming
Do you remember when we moved shop down there by leman
Do you remember at the room hoes catching semen
Do you remember I busted two with the green eye demon
Yeah nigga I remember cross the tracks
When calvan rich and kenny wayne had a gang of that crack
Mane I remember all that when E-40 was jamming
Everybody play B's and D's listening to that dayton family
I remember daddy-O when he put me on syrup
Remember Junior was 14 working with a quarter bird nigga

[Hook - Boosie] 2x
Them long night on the block (I remember nigga)
Went from a little to a lot (I remember nigga)
In this world with no dreams (I remember nigga)
Gone off X and codine (I remember nigga)

[Verse 2 - Boosie]
When daddy left this world (I remember nigga)
Tha nights I made them lil girls (I remember nigga)
Grandpa preaching at church (I remember nigga)
Grucen gave me my first work (I remember nigga)
Me and big chris on the block (I remember nigga)
Walk in the school with a knot (I remember nigga)
Remember nobody ain't like us (I remember nigga)
When I set it off with titus (I remember nigga)
17 I was a donkey
Killing my own people
Serving my own uncles
Gave life to trell (I remember nigga)
When he touch down I caused hell (I remember nigga)
My first fifty block of weed (I remember nigga)
I wasn't nothing but 19 (I remember nigga)
When I first met T and Mel (I remember nigga)
When y'all got me out of jail (I remember nigga)
Yeah (I remember nigga)

[Hook - Boosie] 2x

[Verse 3 - Boosie]
First time I rode clean (I remember nigga)
Got my heart broke at 14 (I remember nigga)
Member the first nigga I robbed (I remember)
I remember them tears cried
I remember they killed "I"
I remember them pills I used to pop
That had a nigga Frenzy
Same niggas I used to pop wit now they envy
Cousins frenzy I'm on some flossed out shit
I go to emmy when I wanna floss my wrist
Member daddy used to hit momma when times was hard
But it never showed on her boys cause her boys was spoiled
Member my beamer, my maginum, and my 45
Member my silver STS with the fresh ties
My old school monte' carlo nigga, candy black
