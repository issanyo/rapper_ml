Feat. Big Head & Savage

What the motherfucking crook
… what you know about south side…
What … where you at…where the boulevard at
Where the track boyz at, we throw it up like that
It ain’t no section like my section boy we get that shot
… on a billboard…
Where the … like that, niggers lay low… and show me the rope
… it’s for … who made me wanna have a lot of things
It’s the deal who put me in it as a child main
…man they got niggers busting at you
So you best be heading for the rapshit nigga
One time can’t fade us
Holler out the dumb, way the niggers get paper
But don’t nobody get along
And ain’t nobody front you gotta get it on your own nigga

Take a walk in that south where the motherfuckers thugs roll
Walk with the killers, shooting on the rings
Take a walk in that south where the motherfuckers thugs roll
Talk that shit…
Take a walk in that south where the motherfuckers thugs roll
Walk with the killers, shooting on the rings
Take a walk in that south where the motherfuckers thugs roll
Talk that shit…

…to that south side, catch me outside
With niggers I push your brains on the outside
I was just…now I spit attention…
Used to talk them 38 now we let them choppers melt
Get dealt with quick or keep it a hundred
Cause gorillaz on your street equipped with a hundred
…they gonna get it … cause I just showed them how
… they sell to…cause they mamas go…and the choppers go …
…nigga throw in the towel

Take a walk in that south where the motherfuckers thugs roll
Walk with the killers, shooting on the rings
Take a walk in that south where the motherfuckers thugs roll
Talk that shit…
Take a walk in that south where the motherfuckers thugs roll
Walk with the killers, shooting on the rings
Take a walk in that south where the motherfuckers thugs roll
Talk that shit…

South side nigga, I’m rapping from the heart of me
It’s part of me, slit a nigga veins and my artery
…anywhere we be, we might be…
Back in 95 the brokest nigga had a quarter key
Shout out to… shout out gangster nig..
Where I used to fight my piss
… big didy, … what’s happening…
We don’t … suit you in your…
Blowing killing in the wind…
Gangster…better…

Take a walk in that south where the motherfuckers thugs roll
Walk with the killers, shooting on the rings
Take a walk in that south where the motherfuckers thugs roll
Talk that shit…
Take a walk in that south where the motherfuckers thugs roll
Walk with the killers, shooting on the rings
Take a walk in that south where the motherfuckers thugs roll
Talk that shit…
