[Verse 1: Quando Rondo]
They locked my uncle up in prison he just wrote me a letter
He told me don't entertain bullshit just stack up my cheddar
On top of that don’t trust these niggas cause they change like the weather
Don't put your love inside these bitches cause forever is never
I told him how niggas dissin' and I never even met ’em
My main partner went to snitchin' I can't wait til I catch 'em
Plus my P.O steady trippin' cause I keep failing my piss test
Back to back I'm steady sipping plus I keep poppin' these percocets
I'm to the point where shit ain’t funny back to back I’m smoking cigarettes
When everybody askin' for money it’s kinda hard to run up a check
Say my aunt left him for dead, nephew, everybody walkin' now
We quick to bust a nigga head when it's over, that shit not talked about
I ain't tell you bout that nigga called his self shooting up grandma house
Now I got to hit his street and let his neighbors hear that chopper shout
This the same ass nigga that use to sleep on my momma couch
Feelin’ like fuck it in public, Lil Leeky in public hoppin' out
Feds just did a sweep again they tryna get the gang over
Sippin' all this liquor I might fuck around have a hangover
Hustle hard to the game over, I can't wait til this pain over
Them niggas wasn't on my level it was time to switch the lane over

[Hook]
I got some charges pending but I steady be spinnin'
Pee told me I was goin broke but I steady be spendin'
I'm a convicted felon but I still keep a weapon
They say the life I live three options that's jail, hell or Heaven
I got some charges pending but I steady be spinnin'
Pee told me I was goin broke but I steady be spendin'
I'm a convicted felon but I still keep a weapon
They say the life I live three options that's jail, hell or Heaven

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
I grew up thuggin like fuck it
Bust that bitch up in public
I made it past twenty-one muthafucker I'm lucky
Bustin' that thirty, thirty times ain't no way you can duck it
I'm out that bottom, king lobster of the crabs in the bucket
I clear some yards with the draco (yea, yea, yea)
I got some niggas goin' hard when I say so (yea yea)
I got a couple options
Get on the road and get it poppin' I depend on my artist I hope they got me
Off the parole back on the purp
Waitin' on C-Murda, waitin' on B.G to jump them last couple hurdles
If they try you will you murder or would you let that shit go
You got options handle your business or be labeled a hoe
