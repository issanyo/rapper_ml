[Verse 1:]
I got a call from a friend who I used to love
She told me meet me at the bar at my favorite club
I Sat down got my drink from my favorite wine
Den I felt a cold rush coming from behind
She grabbed my waist and whispered in my ear
Thug I miss you
We need to talk cause me and my man, we got sum issues
We started remininesin bad times and the good times
Like my first line
You cute, will u be mine?
Smelling just like how I remember
She was looking fine
And I ain't coming home tonight
Thats whats on my mind
Tell my girl I got studio time
Go snatch a rentle cause my car draw to much attention
We hit da room
We got to drankin and shit
And off top I was gon think with my dick
We hit da embassy suites
Man she turned 2 a beast
She introduced me to her tongue ring and put me to sleep

[Chorus:]
I ain't coming home tonight
I know it ain't right (x3)
Cause tonight I'm on flight
Tonight I'm on flight

[Verse 2:]
Just had a concert
I'm tired and my lungs hurt
Wen she walk n vip with a high skirt
She had a azz like buffy
She turned me on
I even went started blushing wen I saw ha thong
She grabbed my cheeks and said ohh u so cute
She had a girl dat wanted webbie
She was cold too
I asked can we come in see em before we take it in
I hit they spot
I hit da tub
She start laughing then
Dont look like ain't comin home tonight
Cause da conversation right and da vibe is tight
Man she came to da bed
With a tshirt and a draws on
As soon as she lay onside boosie
I got a hard on
I put my hand up on ha thighs
Den I rub dat coochie
I herd her moan up unda ha breath " oh boosie"
Dat pussy soakin wet
Man we all on da floor
I hit ha from da back
And it's a fact dat I ain't comin home

[Chorus]


[Verse 3:]
Me n my girl just had a fight
I gotta get away
Look like I ain't coming home 4 a couple days
I hit da plane
I Chill
Put on my shades
On da plane came shhh
Now I'm in a daze
I approached her
U remember them lil boosie days?
I broke ya virgin at 15
Now u feel played
By the way
Why them bruises on yo fuckin face?
She said my man still bringing up that boosie case
Whats yo destination?
Florida
Thats what I'm goin too
I'm at da same hotel u at
Room 102
And u can come to my room
But she said no
She said no u can come too mines
I got a surprise
I walked up into da room
And smell was da best
She had on a lil red dress.....

[Chorus]
