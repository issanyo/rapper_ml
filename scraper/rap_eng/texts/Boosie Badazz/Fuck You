Bitch pursue me like that
Smoke nothin' but the best
Cruise and lay back
With some trill niggas
That I knew just way back
Still young
I ain't caught my first murder case yet
Stay scrappin'
And can't wait to push a nigga face back
Number one on 1-oh-6
Still around the racetrack
Still hangin' in the mix
Where I ain't safe at
I'm on some foolishness shit
With these rugers and shit
I'm on some run in your house bitch
You move and get hit
I can't take out my grill
Cause I can't take out this reel
I'm the savage shit trille
And from my heart man I feel

(Pimp C:)
I did your bitch outta pocket
Put some dick in her ass
I got a 84 baritz and its sittin on glass
I'm a young pimp nigga
With a whole lotta swagger
And I roll like a stone
Like my name Mick Jagger
Pussy niggas can't f**k with the pimp in the savage
We gettin' sucked in every city
Make a whole lot of cabbage
Gettin' head on the regular level ya ain't shit
Some real trille niggas for life up in this bitch
I never go to war without that motherf**kin' gun
Down south bitch we like DMC and run
Like chuck D say bitch my oozie weigh a ton
I might be on parole but bitch I'll knock out ya lungs
I come from the city where they sell cocaine
Ya get caught sniffin
Niggas knock out ya brain
Leave a lump in ya lap
Your tongue in your dash so I bust 17
And I smashed the gas

F**k you nigga

Been like that since I was little
From the hood
Where the killas keep them pistols smokin'
Swishas drink liquor bang a nigga
Southside gangsta nigga
F**k everything you goin' through
Badazz'll punish you
Show no love
Love will get you killed
So here we come for you
Gats a gat a stack's a stack
My click they'll beast
It's goin' down where we roam
In the hotel suite
Old lady gone crazy
Caught me rollin up 3
Beat that pussy out her drawers
And I put her to sleep
You bullshittin' with me
Boy my nerves stay bad
Get one of my convicts out the hood to put that dick in ya ass
