[Intro]
I'd like to welcome everybody to the Boosie Blues Cafe
Come in, sit down, have a good time
And I'ma talk to the first lady I see
I'ma talk to you, that pretty lady right there
I'm too much for you
I'm the bad boy in the movie, man
I'm too much for you
I'm a lil' too much
I'm too much for you
Boosie Badazz
I'm too much for you, huh

[Verse]
I'm Bobby Brown when he had money (I'm lit)
I'm too much for you (I'm too much for myself)
I'm James Dean doin' a hundred (I drive fast cars)
I'm too much for you
Pac-Man, that pussy have you runnin' (Come here, come here)
I'm too much for you (Come here)
This sperm I got'll swell your stomach (I know you heard 'bout them kids)
Huh, I'm too much for you (I'm too much for you)
Don't come around if you ain't naked (Tell me, girl, tell me)
Is that too much for you? (Is that too much for you?)
This Boosie love'll have you crazy (Crazy)
Have you wanna have my baby (Too much for you)
I make your ex holler mayday (Mayday, I ain't the one to play with)
I'm too much for you (Too much for you)
I do that boy like I'm Tay-K (Free Tay-K, check my rap sheet)
I'm too much for you (Too much for you)
Mama say I'm too much for these young women
But Mama, I'm a shark, and I love swimmin'
And they ready (And they ready, Mama)
They so ready (They so ready)
Scorpio is ready (Promise you I'm ready)
I'm so ready (I'm so ready)
Blow my mind in the bathroom (Give me head in the bathroom)
Is that too much for you? (Is that too much for you?)
Your mama house in the back room (Your mama house in the back room)
Is that too much for you? (Is that too much for you?)
The balcony at the Fontainebleau (Top floor, lookin' down, gettin' fucked)
Is that too much for you? (Is that too much for you?)
Let me know, baby
'Cause I want you, baby (I want you right now)
But it's dangerous, honey
I want you, baby, huh (I want you, baby)
But it's dangerous, darling
