This one here for them baby mommas
Who make baby daddies don't even want no baby daddy
Feel this nigga. Lil Boosie. Check dis outt

[Verse]
Baby momma baby momma
I'm tired of you
I'm to the point where I wanna fire you
You play the games that a child will do
When you need to do the things that a mama do
Baby momma baby momma
You stressin me (you stressin me girl)
Cause I ain't rich you think less of me (you think less of me)
And we ain't gotta take the test to see
You need to change yo ways so you can see the best of me
Baby momma baby momma
You lied to me (you lied)
A good man I tried to be (I tried)
You do me wrong even the blind can see
That's why I got another woman on the side of me
And she gon love me better (yea)
Fuck me better warm me up up in the coldest weather
She bout whatever you heard me
Baby momma baby momma I trusted you
It was so good I left it in when I made love to you

[Hook]
I'm askin
Why you cryin girl?
Why you be lyin girl?
Why you won't shine girl?
On the stretch you know it's mine girl
Im askin
Why you have a baby?
Just to drive me crazy?
Why you be actin shady?
When you posed to be my lady

[Verse]
Baby momma baby momma
Thought you love me ho? (thought you love me ho)
But you won't put a child on child support
And you don't even want my child to know
That it ain't daddy it's his mama who wildin' tho
Baby momma baby momma
You jealous of me
You don't even want the fellas wit me (my niggas)
And you keep on telling me
To slow my role but behind you I'm catchin' felonies
Baby momma baby momma
Where the love done went? (where the luv done went)
Don't wanna leave you cuz I love ya scent (ya smell)
The names I call you ain't really meant
But I'm tired of all these fightin's and arguments
Besides we grown not no mo teenagers
So you can stop playin them games tryna check my pager
You need to get ya mind right if not I'll see you later
You posed to take my side but you listen to the hatas (damn)
[Hook]
I'm askin

Baby momma baby momma
You hurted me
Me and you know you deserted me (why?)
I ain't gon lie feel like you murdered me
Cause you the only girl who ever hold work for me
Baby momma baby momma
You a possum now (you sneaky)
I heard you ridin through the bottom now (for what)
You tryna get back on my team
Cause you heard I had a major plug on prementhazime bitch please
Baby momma look what I did for you (look what I did)
I took you places that you never knew (you ain't even know that)
I bought you any kind of tennis shoe
If I thought I wouldn't gon make it I'll finish you (blaw)
Baby momma you missin me (I know that)
I know you miss how you was kissin me (fa sho)
It's sad to say that you a friend of me
But just remember can't nobody lay that dick like me
