[Hook]
No one care about this heart of mine
(I feel alone, alone, -lone, -lone, mama)
Why Baton Rouge can’t have no second line
Maybe that will help this heart of mine

[Verse 1]
I got this heartfelt thug shit
Because my heart has been broken and stolen
Busted wide open, close your eyes and picture me rollin’
Looking for haters and narcotics out the same mirror
Watching my back across the track with my main hitter
I need a pat on my back, I need a favor
I just got beef for 400 grand by my man, from the crater
I won’t go dig my nigga casket up, take it down Highland road
Take pictures wit your casket while everybody throwing four

[Hook]
No one care about this heart of mine
(I feel alone, alone, -lone, -lone, mama)
Why Baton Rouge can’t have no second line
Maybe that will help this heart of mine

[Verse 2]
This heart probably can’t be fixed no way
Real talk, it been broken like that
Too many died unexpected times, it was stolen like that
Me and my partner watching, tryna find a mole in the pack
He was an OG, and certified, I ain’t know he a rat
She say she love me why you ain’t love me in Angola like that
You let your hating ass friends put your foot on my back
I miss my friends ’til the end, we be really living like that
Need a second line to bring some memories back (that's Lil' Bleek and Lil' Ivory)

[Hook]
No one care about this heart of mine
(I feel alone, alone, -lone, -lone, mama)
Why Baton Rouge can’t have no second line
Maybe that will help this heart of mine

[Verse 3]
If Finn in the cut dawg, swinging like a mud dawg, biting on his lip with his left hand
Wish I could take him back to basketball, layups with left hand
He lost Lil' Ivy we both was crying, now he just don’t care man
Billy the kid, they finally got him, gunshot out his left head
Snaked Lil' Bleek when I was gone, he was my right and left hand
I’m standing strong behind Bleek name, like Finn with his left hand
I just want know who care man, seven eleven hustle with me
Go right back in that struggle with me
Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel

[Hook] x 2
No one care about this heart of mine
(I feel alone, alone, -lone, -lone, mama)
Why Baton Rouge can’t have no second line
Maybe that will help this heart of mine
