[Hook-Lil Boosie]
When we came to the can, these niggas ran
This for the bitch-ass niggas, we blessed they open hands
But when we came to the can, these niggas ran
No holler, no letters, no cheddar, nah, nigga

[Verse 1-Lil Boosie]
When I came to the can, I saw it live and direct
What I seen with my eyes made me lose a lot of respect
For niggas I wrote checks, niggas I put clothes on
Niggas I gave a home, niggas I fronted heroin
Nigga can't even put [???] on a housephone
Shit, I had love for them niggas, now it's all gone
Nigga at the club with Rose by the cases
Stun the hoes like he chosen, this nigga made it
When he came down [???] situation I was the first one he called
But this nigga ducked my daughter in the mall
I should send a nigga to get that, but I'm gonna be cool
Cause if I cross ya and cutthroat ya, nigga, I'mma be you
You made the first mistake, nigga, when you forgot about misconduct
Second mistake, at court nigga, you wasn't even behind him
But I'm gon' kill you with kindness, what's happening nigga I'm out
Your VIP status is gone from the club to my house

[Hook]

[Verse 2-C-Murder]
Soon as that jury said "guilty,"
Everybody, they killed me
See this nigga on this hook, Lil Boosie? He feel me
I've got blood that say wanna see me rot in a box
I guess they feel them bullets gon' stop, but I think not
I feel like "Nah," they gonna be aiming for y'all
Cause y'all niggas ain't got C-Murder to call
I was a dog, [cussin?] and all, stole my Rolex and wrote checks
And God forgive me cause right now I wanna break this nigga neck
[???] and pushing more chickens
And my mission is to get revenge, [??] at my friends
They became my foes, man, I can't trust them hoes
I used to love my own brother, but I don't love him no more
Don't wanna hug him no more, cause this a limit fasho
That's why I tongue-kiss that tech 9, and fuck that .44
That's why I love Corey, Chelsea, Courtney and Shanelle
And if that ain't you, dog, you niggas can go to Hell
