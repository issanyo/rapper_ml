[Intro]
Scorpio love
Girl you're crazy, girl you're crazy
I'm a Scorpio, means I'm so damn sexual

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl go down low (come on girl), make it ride for me (get it up)
Show me your wild side girl, take your time with me (take your time with me)
Spread your legs (lay back), spread your legs girl
You shake your head, no you can't take this head girl

[Chorus]
Yeah, Scorpios are a one in a million
You want more and more and more (you'll never get enough of a Scorpio)
Our love ain't no ordinary feeling (can you take it?)
All night long

[Verse 1]
Come on girl, take a ride (come on)
Let me get your body high (come on)
Let me breathe on your cat, wet your inside
Raise your leg from the side then switch sides (let's go)
I'm 'bout whatever
You can bring her, we can do it together
You know how I do, I be steppin' with truth
I promise our sex on a whole 'nother level
Fucked her in the asshole with strawberry lube
Covered her mouth, don't you make a sound
Twelve play (twelve play baby)
It's twelve plays when I lay you down
Twelve play (twelve play)
Horny all the time, want it all the time
After first time we fucked, she knew my sign (you must be a Scorpio)

[Chorus]
Yeah, Scorpios are a one in a million
You want more and more and more (you'll never get enough of a Scorpio)
Our love ain't no ordinary feeling (can you take it?)
All night long

[Verse 2]
Girl you ever had a nigga really turned you out, really turned you out? (really turned you out)
Let you cum all in his mouth, really turned you off
Then he tongue kissed you, turned you on
And she wanted more, she needed it
I sucked on her fingers and played with her clit
Then rubbed her asshole, she skeeted
Girl don't you run from me
I take sex to the max, bitch I'm a Scorpio
You say I'm a dog, what you callin' for? (I know what's wrong)
You stung by a Scorpio
Give you that real and put you in your feelings
Forever have life, we will always have dealings
Fucked you good and a Scorpio
If he ride with you he die with you, you stuck with him

[Chorus]
Yeah, Scorpios are a one in a million
You want more and more and more (you'll never get enough of a Scorpio)
Our love ain't no ordinary feeling (can you take it?)
All night long

[Outro]
Girl go down low, make it ride for me
Show me your wild side girl, take your time with me
Spread your legs, spread your legs girl
You shake your head, no you can't take this head girl
Girl go down low (girl go down low), make it ride for me (make it ride for me)
Show me your wild side girl, take your time with me (take your time with me)
Spread your legs (spread your legs), spread your legs girl (spread your legs girl)
You shake your head, no you can't take this head girl, hey
Scorpios are a one in a million
