[Intro]
Dear God
I ask you to make my heart cold tonight
From all strangers all bustas
You know what im talking about?
Father God I been betrayed
Cause I been betrayed
Feel like they beat me like a slave
How many niggas been betrayed out there tonight
Plenty of times nigga
Nigga don't keep it real no more

[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
After all the fucking shit we done been through (huh bruh)
All the pussy niggas we done tend to (huh bruh)
But it don't mean nothing when a nigga money low
Niggas will shoot you in the back and cut yo fucking throat like Rich and Alpo
Now its hard for me to trust somebody
Family neither they'll steal if they know you got it
God forgive me I been hurt by a couple niggas
That's why I wake up say my prayers and be like fuck a nigga
Bitches want riches so they trying to slide the rubber off trying to get pregnant
When you stupid hoes gon' learn yo lesson (mm mm mm)
Man it seem like the mo love you show a nigga
When you fall off you be like damn did I know this nigga
I'm glad I rap cuz these days they testify
Nigga ain't catch you with nothin' and he got 25
Just cuz he say he gon' ride don't mean he loyal dawg
It's Cain and Abel again forgive us father God

[Hook]
Father God I been betrayed (turn on me)
Feel like they beat me like a slave (my homie)
But I learn from my mistakes (I learn from my mistakes)
We living in the last days pray for me and make me cold hearted
Father God I been betrayed (turn on me)
Feel like they beat me like a slave (my homie)
But I learn from my mistakes (I learn from my mistakes)
We living in the last days pray for me and make me cold hearted

[Verse 2: Lil Boosie]
They criticize me huh, they talk about me bad
Ain't nobody wanna sign me, I had to show my ass
If I love you ain't no question i'd give my last
One day this heart gonna get me zipped up in a body bag
What about ya first love? Huh she played it cold didn't it?
Made a nigga shed a tear and she changed a nigga
So we fuck'em and dump'em never trust'em or love'em
No need for friends, fuck friends, friends turn into bustas
Momma gonna tell ya when that nigga ain't right (momma know!)
Momma know because she pray every night
I done and wash my hands with all this pussy shit
Niggas be hating but Boosie Boo he hood rich
On top of that I'm a Scorpio so I'm unforgivable
First time you fuck with me dog I let them killas go
I'm down and dirty cause a nigga heard me
Geefus supposed to be dead but I let him slide cause he ain't worth it

[Hook]
Father God I been betrayed (turn on me)
Feel like they beat me like a slave (my homie)
But I learn from my mistakes (I learn from my mistakes)
We living in the last days pray for me and make me cold hearted
Father God I been betrayed (turn on me)
Feel like they beat me like a slave (my homie)
But I learn from my mistakes (I learn from my mistakes)
We living in the last days pray for me and make me cold hearted

[Verse 3: Webbie]
Feel like somebody burning candles on me
That's why that choppa in my phantom and my house got all them cameras on it
Know I'm standing under the light
So I just try to do right
Ain't been in church but I pray every night
Its like I used to didn't give a fuck
But over the years I don learned and I got out here
And earned so much to live for
My niggas tell me slow it down for real you need to chill bruh
Stay up on your grind, take your time, bring your kids up
My grandma told me look at you look what the streets done did to ya
Alot of niggas done changed on me
I came up they switched up my daughter almost died, man it all seem wrong
The only thing good is my dog came home
My mind gone my heart mad my soul so pissed
I think my niggas tried to rob me, that's some fucked up shit
Blowing killa when I ride, in my mirror when I ride by
Can see some niggas doing a coward-ass drive-by
Some of these pussies really think that they got 9 lives
You might as well don't even bust back
Cause this bitch 100 shots
And we been getting it by the pound
You know we blunted out
Something fancy stunt it out
Throwing money out

[Hook]
Father God I been betrayed (turn on me)
Feel like they beat me like a slave (my homie)
But I learn from my mistakes (I learn from my mistakes)
We living in the last days pray for me and make me cold hearted
Father God I been betrayed (turn on me)
Feel like they beat me like a slave (my homie)
But I learn from my mistakes (I learn from my mistakes)
We living in the last days pray for me and make me cold hearted
