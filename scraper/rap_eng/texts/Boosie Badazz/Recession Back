Stingy niggas scraping up the crumbs and recook em
I paint my line and we hook em and get pay for what this time we took em
Broad daylight we be serving while these neighbours looking
Playing with this white, that dog food that never shook em
I got bills and all my bitches creamed
Still false and I can’t tell you what none of these numbers mean
Bitch I’m pissing dirty I won’t put this cup down, pour it
Just woke up early, waiting for them bricks to touch down
I just bought another trap in case this one get shut down
Shit getting outta hand we serving out the back and front now
I’m pulling up a chopper with them guapo
I fuck with them blacks but i still sell rocks though
