[Chorus:]
Ain’t nobody putting it on bitch
Get it by myself ridin, smoking on that strong bitch, strong bitch
I’m by myself
I’m ridin stealth, ridin stealth [x4]
Ooh, we

[Verse 1:]
I’m all alone, all alone
Me in my zone, my zone
I turned off my phone, off my phone
Then I, throw me some strong, some strong
So long, so long
I’m on another high, another high
But don’t touch the guy, touch the guy
I have my youngers driving by, driving by
I guess niggas won’t die tonight, right, right
Follow my lead, my lead
From A to Z
That X in my jeans, my jeans
Pouring cars like supreme

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Ain’t nobody put me on bitch
I ain’t need no help
See I got my own shit
Own it by myself
Don’t even ride with my own bitch
They blame it  to the left
Jury know I ain’t drop no hits
Cause I do it myself
Quarter million koush, that strong shit
Five grams a switcher
Always sold low dough low
Cause my last code defendant
I find I’m too big to ride solo
I disagree
By myself in the cell
And watching the world shit on me, oh lord
Who go stop me
Not you haters
Not Miley
(Who you gonna pick up today)
No motherfucking body
The whole world tryna sign me
But I’m already owned
Peaking at the I-Phone
Oh shit, instagram down

[Chorus]
