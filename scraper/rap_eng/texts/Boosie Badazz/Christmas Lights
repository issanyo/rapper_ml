[Intro: Boosie Badazz]
Savage Holidays, nigga
Look at these Christmas lights
Everybody love me

[Chorus: Boosie Badazz]
Christmas lights, Christmas lights, look at these Christmas lights
Christmas lights, Christmas lights, look at these Christmas lights
Kids love these Christmas lights, girls love these Christmas lights
Every time you see me, I got on a bunch of Christmas lights

[Verse 1: Boosie Badazz]
I got a chain on my neck with the charm
Bible on my neck and the scripture come from psalms
Diamonds in my ears make the women go crazy
Jesus on my neck and somethin' for your old baby (Lights)
Step up on the scene (Lights), me and my whole team (Lights)
Iceman Nick, big shit, bet it’s gon' hit
Rose gold set, I'm kind of cold, man
Yung Bleu up in this bitch lookin’ like a fuckin' snowman

[Chorus: Boosie Badazz]
Christmas lights, Christmas lights, look at these Christmas lights
Christmas lights, Christmas lights, look at these Christmas lights
Kids love these Christmas lights, girls love these Christmas lights
Every time you see me, I got on a bunch of Christmas lights

[Verse 2: Tootie Raww]
I'm a baby Christmas tree named Tootie, I'm Raww
And my diamonds they be drippin', they drippin' just like some water
Name a youngin go harder, I get it from my father
We be turned up for Christmas, ain't nobody goin' harder
And I spend what I wanna spend, get what I wanna get
Might just cop a watch and bust it down and you know it hit
Trel get on Christmas lights, Webbie got on Christmas lights
Everybody ’round us, they got on a bunch of Christmas lights

[Chorus: Boosie Badazz]
Christmas lights, Christmas lights, look at these Christmas lights
Christmas lights, Christmas lights, look at these Christmas lights
Kids love these Christmas lights, girls love these Christmas lights
Every time you see me, I got on a bunch of Christmas lights
Christmas lights, Christmas lights, look at these Christmas lights
Christmas lights, Christmas lights, look at these Christmas lights
Kids love these Christmas lights, girls love these Christmas lights
Every time you see me, I got on a bunch of Christmas lights

[Verse 3: Iviona Badazz]
Ivi, ice me out, check my time, I’m Christmas lights down
17, big B, and it bling and it shine, plus it got a crown
All my fans like my smile and they know that I'm worth it
Shout out to pops, he give his all, our Christmas so perfect
Diamonds sick, they hittin’, yeah, bling
Put a lil' sparkle on my car, make sure my horses clean
Look at the lights, tell me how bright, no, this is not no dream
Say this the life, so we ball whenever that we please

[Chorus: Boosie Badazz]
Christmas lights, Christmas lights, look at these Christmas lights
Christmas lights, Christmas lights, look at these Christmas lights
Kids love these Christmas lights, girls love these Christmas lights
Every time you see me, I got on a bunch of Christmas lights
Christmas lights, Christmas lights, look at these Christmas lights
Christmas lights, Christmas lights, look at these Christmas lights
Kids love these Christmas lights, girls love these Christmas lights
Every time you see me, I got on a bunch of Christmas lights
