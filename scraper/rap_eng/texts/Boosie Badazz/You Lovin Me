Chorus: Sizzla
Where do you go, don't you need my baby
Why can't you come on and let us play
When are you going to come my way
What are the things they've been telling you
I've got to stop them from compelling you girl
They just won't stop me from getting you

Verse 1: Lil Boosie
All I need is you lovin' me
You say my niggas they corruptin' me, but
I can take you places you ain't seen, you're my queen (you're my queen)
I love how you look in those sexy jeans
I could, fulfill your dreams and your fantasies
I could, take you ballin' out on shopping sprees, you're my queen (you're my queen)
Where do I go when I need some love? You
Nobody sex me like you sex me girl, it's true
But they can't stop me, I won't let them
You can tell them to, stay out our business and stop compelling you

Chorus: Sizzla
Where do you go, don't you need my baby
Why can't you come on and let us play
When are you going to come my way
What are the things they've been telling you
I've got to stop them from compelling you girl
They just won't stop me from getting you
I'm gonna' take you right there, love for a lifetime
I'm gonna' make your life so clear, girl gonna make you mine
I'm gonna' take you right there, love for a lifetime
I'm gonna' make your life so clear, gonna make you mine


Verse 2: B.G
I hope you know you got a real nigga
I just want you to feel Jizzle
I know they say that I dun killed niggas but, you're my girl (you're my girl)
It ain't no secret, I'm a street nigga (street nigga)
But under that I'm still sweet nigga
You just need a chance to see baby, you're my girl (you're my girl)
You're old enough to make your own decisions
You wanna' to be with me then come be with me
Know what they say is compelling you but, you're my girl (you're my girl)
