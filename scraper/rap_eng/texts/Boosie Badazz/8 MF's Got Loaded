Ghetto Stories..

Gramdma always told me, that shit easy to get in, but hard to get out

[Hook]
8 motherfuckers got loaded
8 motherfuckers got dusted and disgusted huh
4 of them niggas couldn't control it
Couple niggas went too hard and flipped out
Now 2 of them niggas gone josin', gaaaaah daamn! (Why?)
Cuz 8 motherfuckers got loaded
8 motherfuckers got dusted and disgusted now

[Verse 1 - Lil Boosie]
It all starts with a club night, a club fight
To a night you'll never forget, real shit
Remember that murder case with slick, that took down like 6
Well somebody had to drown cuz only 2 went down
How many fist fights that lead to murder (so many mane)
Niggas can't take a ass whippin, they come and spit that thang
Call Joe and Buck to handle business, I heard they layed it down
Niggas talk they got L's for tryna help they round
How many times we had to fight and couldn't control it
Cuz Head Busser and Titus got too loaded, can't even count
That's how it start off niggas come through be tryna bounce
Out ya body like Big Whop, a getcha stopped
So make sho every nigga that's buckin' with ya, they ridin' with ya
Die with ya get on the stand and lie with ya
If you ain't bout slanggin' no iron talk to hoes
But them 4's they in the middle of the floor
Like let's get ready to rumble!
