[Chorus:]
Pistol bigger than me [x8]

[Verse 1:]
The pistol bigger than me
See how I do the T
Real nigga on the block with a big Bow 9
Hustle hard out there every week
Think a nigga won’t come whip down on your block
Fuck I will spray the whole street
Thinking Imma game
I let this bitch say, bang bang I ain’t never fifteen
But that don’t mean nothing cause boy I get it popping
Skip school, break rules and pop tools like a wife
And I told Boss Man, boy they can’t stop me
Little maniac, I’m itching for me your body
Forty wood,need to get this job done
Run up or creep up on you
Put it on you, now my job done
Anyday, the wrong day, you play this
Gonna be a hard day
Young white nigga, he got it
So I’m go rob him

Pistol bigger than me [x16]

[Verse 2:]
You nigga, big pimp, but I ball hardly
You nigga, I ain’t telling where my lawyer at
Tall dreads without the plait (This line is not clear)
Me smoking, D Vogue,  take you nigga
Fishing for, you won’t want to be the bait nigga
Pistol bigger than a nigga, that don’t mean nothing
Me and my girls are jumping
Beast mode and squeeze something
Chopper hit him in his head watch his soul leave
Fuck that nigga, that’s his issue, that nigga owed me
Fuck, die slowly
We ain’t gonna talk about it
Large 40 on my waste I don’t leave home without it
Brave dog don’t bite
I don’t brawl about it
Think I won’t bust this big bitch
Well you're wrong about it
I might give it to one of these people seriously

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
See it under my seat
Pistol bigger than me
I give it to you for free
Pistol bigger than me
Ask about me in the street
They say pistol bigger than me
Feel like I’m standing seven feet
Pistol bigger than me
That nigga (x5)
With a big whole pistol
That nigga (x5)
With a big whole pistol
Hey
Rest in peace Lil Yomin
Lil Nick, they tired
Killer blood
Pistol bigger than me nigga
Pistol bigger than me
Bad ass from town
Monster music
