[Intro]
I’m that nigga now
Yes I am
Who dat
Who dat
Boosie
Yes I am

[Verse 1]
Wake up, fresh out tha shower
Started brushin’ my fade
Started thinkin’ bout money
Started thinkin’ bout plays
Dropped that pack to my nephew
My lil nephew serve J’s
They don’t come out til next month
But we got, them new J’s
Nigga all in my DM
Say they gon’ shoot me wit’ choppas
But I checked them pussy niggas page
They ain’t got no followers
I’m kinda on, and I know it
Stack it up, I don’t blow it
Life of the party for real
When I walk in, you gon’ know it
I’m not a poet
Just spit this shit from tha top of my soul
Ima gangsta
He a poet
That’s the ???
I might not be him where you from
But in Dallas, TX I’m cold
Cuz they believed I was the best
Since 16 years old
Got some niggas who look up to me
16 years old
My same swag starin’ at me like my old G code
Probably catch me on somebody beach
Wit’ like 16 ho’s
Boosie Estates, my own land
That’s like 16 mo’
Jewelhouse, my own clothes
I don’t need no store
My lil’ girls love me to death
I don’t need no ho
I bleed that 4 from tha birth to tha graveyard step
My enemies wish me death
They gon’ need graveyard help

[Hook]
I’m that nigga now
Yes I am
Who that
Boo that (2x)

[Verse 2]
You ain’t gotta tell me girl
I know I’m tha shit
Got my stunt from Calvin Ricks
He liked gold on his shit
Tattoo’d blood for real G’s
We put 4’s on our shit
Took a dream, and made it happen
Watch ? get rich
Ima role model
But I’m not a role model
Cuz I don’t hang around the good scholars
We all goblins
We be swaggin’
We don’t need stylists
If you don’t know playa
We come from nothing at all dawg
So this is all profit
Nobody fuckin’ wit’ my music
Gon’ always say that shit
Feelin’ like Dolph, don’t play wit’ me
Play wit’ yo bitch
Feelin’ like Gotti
I’m tha King of this shit
Every time you see Boosie
I be clean, ask ya bitch about me
My music be hot shit
The realist since Pac shit
Guess I never had shit
So I’m on this two watch shit
Got some niggas in prison
I send em money, they straight
If you just thinkin’ I’m tha truth
Appreciate it, but you late

[Hook]
I’m that nigga now
Yes I am
Who that
Boo that (2x)
