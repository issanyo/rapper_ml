[Verse 1:]
Now, this first verse, for Ivyanna
The only seed I actually watched come outta momma
And she so smart, and she so cute I think she gifted man
She gimme sweet eyes say she love me just to lift the pain
But she don't know about her sister and her baby brother
They need to talk, but they can't talk cuz they crazy mothers
I feed her, clothe her, take her places all across the nation
She know I rap and know her daddy be on tv stations
She see my magnum, and she run up, hollin' daddy daddy
So on that strength, when I'm in beef, I'll let you niggas have it
And she ain't even 4 though
But she be laughing at her daddy when he hit that do do
Behind Ivy man, I go loco, I lose my mind
I see her wake up every morning, even love how she be cryin
And plus she get her nails done, toes done at three
Wear purses and lipstick, oooo, you gotta see
Man, I love her, that's my heart, ain't gon lie, Ivy bad
She done rode first class before she had her first class

[Hook:]
But even if you mama tell you different, daddy love you
For the time that I missed you, daddy love you
For the missing time, da prison time, when ain't no one won't give a dime
Remember this, Daddy love you [repeat]

[Verse 2:]
Now this second verse for Pretty Black
No matter what her momma tell her, she gon love Hatch
And all she want is for her daddy show her love back
She look just like her other grandma, Victoria Hatch
The first year I only saw my child on holidays
I broke her bread but I feel guilty 'bout da hiding days
And now they wanna put a child on child support
I'm finally turning 21, now I'm back in court
I gotta hook up on that lean, now I'm stacking dough
My babys mama's stay at war, it's embarassing whoa
And everytime I see her outside, and she dirty, I clean her
And it hurt me when I clean her cause I'm fresh up out the cleaners
Now I'm feelin bad, time to put her in a beamer
Let her hit the block, looking like her auntie trina
Now she smiling at her daddy, but she ain't sayin too much
Just like Ivy, I give Tarlasia, that tickle touch
Man I love them girls, I like they hair up in curls
I put a end to you life, if you fuck with they world,tarlasia

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3:]
Now this last verse for Tootie Ray
The Ray for his grandfather, who passed away
I wonder if he be like daddy, who blast da K
Made me feel good, cause he cried to go wit daddy today
When he get older I'mma sittin him down and straight up tell
When you was in your mommas stomach boy I gave you hell
You got a cousin look just like you, name lil trell
You got a uncle name Bronson, but he up in jail
And Rocawear just like his daddy, spit on people like his daddy
I guess my fuckin son gon be a savage
And I be having em sagging, and shame on me
But he ain't gonna be no lame round me
So ain't no need to spank a g
And all I do his holla at him
And he get right, and he sit back
He act like he gonna cry, then he wipe his fuckin eyes
Some of my family members won't accept him, dey cold hearted
But dat boy gon be a legend, he gon be so retarded
At 11 I'm gonna go get my son a ferrari
At seven I'm gon get him head at his birthday party
