3 blocks up in the kitchen finna be on
One phone call they finna be gone
I remember 17 gettin' my grind on
All night on the block i ain't tryna find home
45 up in my pocket with a attitude
Any nigga in my way i put this gat on you
Nine pieces
So i gotta have them iron pieces
Dope man the dope man fuck dime pieces
100 pounds of weed
That purple shit
Barrel full of ecstasy thats what i'm working with
Fresh fit with them dope man nikes on
Walk in the club and they turning the lights on
40 gs on my watch just to tell time
100 rounds in my Glock just to slang iron
Ever since i could remember i been wanna shine
From quarter bird to a one five im on the grind gettin mine
