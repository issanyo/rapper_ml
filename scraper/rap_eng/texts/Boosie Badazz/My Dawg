[Intro: T-Rell]
Oh, no, no, no
Hmm

[Chorus: T-Rell]
I just wanna pour another drink with my dawg
And I just wanna sit and talk some shit with my dawg
All them late nights in the club, you never once not show me love
Because nobody got my back like my dawg

I just wanna pour another drink with my dawg
And I just wanna sit and talk some shit with my dawg
All them late nights in the club, you never once not show me love
Because nobody got my back like my dawg

[Verse 1: Boosie Badazz]
My dawg
It's Badass
Ain't gon' lie
Wish we could [?] nigga
One more time
Wish you could hear me rap one more line
Jump in the whip and get one more shine
I miss you nigga like the christmas ceiling
Hurt a nigga hard how they get my nigga
Rolled up on 'em and they twist my nigga
No homo, [?] my nigga
Me Hennessy and you in the coupe
If I fucked you probably fucked up too
'member we rolled on the pussy ass niggas
Never thought that I would roll up on you
Drinkin' out the bottle [?] no juice
Hittin' no coke, patron or chaser
Miss my gangster with all of my heart
Nigga had my back from the very first start
That's a real nigga
And he even though he gone, Boosie still with you
Wish I could hit another lick with you
Wish I could fuck a bad bitch with you
Take you to the mall and go cop some fits with you
One more [?], one more [?], one more sprite
Nigga one more ride
Wish we could get it poppin', nigga
Know you would look good in these [?], nigga
Got your momma nigga [?]
Late night flights, man I miss my thugger
Vice versa [?]
Miss my motherfuckin' [?]

[Chorus: T-Rell]
I just wanna pour another drink with my dawg
And I just wanna sit and talk some shit with my dawg
All them late nights in the club, you never once not show me love
Because nobody got my back like my dawg

I just wanna pour another drink with my dawg
And I just wanna sit and talk some shit with my dawg
All them late nights in the club, you never once not show me love
Because nobody got my back like my dawg

[Verse 2: T-Rell]
Yeah
Look
Ve-ve-verse 2 this for you dawg
Let me tell 'em how it popped off
Let me tell 'em how we started from the bottom when nobody cared about us
Now we movin like a U-Haul (Yeah, yeah)
Everyday I miss my dawg
Rollin' in the coupe with my polo on
Phone ring, cash, nigga
If you ain't about money then we dash, nigga
'Cause my dawg ain't play no games, no
My dawg [?], no
My dawg wanna see me win, yeah
All real love, no pretend
Top floor [?]
We live life like premiere niggas, ha
My dawg never fear niggas
My dawg kept it real, nigga
Pu-pu-pull up in the [?] whip
24 'til the floor with the paint on drip, huh
I swear, I miss my dawg
Put a lantern in the air, reminisce my dawg
'Cause tomorrow's not promised
You can lose a friend in the moment of the hour
Being hard for the cowards
Show love to your dawg equals power
8Ball I miss you dawg
I swear I, I swear I really miss you dawg
[?] gonna hold shit down
Dreams don't die

[Chorus: T-Rell]
I just wanna pour another drink with my dawg
And I just wanna sit and talk some shit with my dawg
All them late nights in the club, you never once not show me love
Because nobody got my back like my dawg

I just wanna pour another drink with my dawg
And I just wanna sit and talk some shit with my dawg
All them late nights in the club, you never once not show me love
Because nobody got my back like my dawg

[Bridge: T-Rell]
Nobody got my back (nobody got my back)
Nobody got my back (nobody got my back)
Nobody got my back like my dawg (like my dawg)
Man I swear, nobody got my back (nobody got my back)
Nobody got my back
I swear nobody got my back like my dawg (like my dawg)
I swear, nobody got my back (nobody got my back)
Nobody got my back
Nobody got my back, like my dawg (like my dawg)
Man I swear, nobody got my back like my dawg
Nobody got my back like my dawg (like my dawg)
