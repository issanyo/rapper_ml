[Verse 1]
I ain’t buying his music, that nigga stupid
That nigga need to be in jail, he belong in a cell
I ain’t never liked Boosie (man but that nigga’s album was straight)
Yeah his album was straight, but what them kids gon do?
You nosy bitch, I fall most of y’all gon turn your backs
And ain’t gon throw me shit!
My side bitch, she was gon after a couple months
Should’ve left that ho alone after a couple fucks
I ain’t forget, some niggas ain’t send me shit
Some hard times
Niggas who I fucked with forgot my son’s Jordan size
Lies, broken promises made my heart cold
Blocks on the phone from bitches I bought red bottoms

[Hook]
I know what they gon do, I know what they gon say
(Man I ain’t got it right now, shit tight man)
If it all falls down again
I know what they gon do, I know what they gon say
(Girl fuck that nigga, he in jail, I ain’t waiting on him)
If it all falls down again
I know what they gon do, I know what they gon say
On IG, IG, twitter, twitter, twitter bout a real nigga

[Verse 2]
They gon call me an asshole, prolly come for my cash flow
Call me a killer
Keep saying that I’m the reason all these little niggas squeezing these triggers
They gon call me the bad guy, you know how they do Badazz
They gon show all them old pictures, codefendants and old pistols
Prolly bring up my jail record, prolly say can’t no jail help me
Bring up that family treatment
First, first, first degree
Boosie back from the dead, no hurting me
You know what they say about me and my clique
We don’t belong on this planet, goddamnit, that’s some cold shit
Even when I beat my case, front page next mother's day
But guess what my mother say, fuck them get money babe

[Hook]
I know what they gon do, I know what they gon say
(Man I ain’t got it right now, shit tight man)
If it all falls down again
I know what they gon do, I know what they gon say
(Girl fuck that nigga, he in jail, I ain’t waiting on him)
If it all falls down again
I know what they gon do, I know what they gon say
On IG, IG, twitter, twitter, twitter bout a real nigga
