[Intro: Bae Bae Savo]
OH Ten
Savo
You know what I'm talkin' bout

[Chorus: Bae Bae Savo]
That Tesla trunk in the front
Got at least fifty when I stunt
Left pocket fat, got a lump
Takin' all bets, nigga dump
I drink Bel-Air bottles after lunch
She gon' eat it all when I cum
Mob ties, chosen one
Two middle fingers, this for Trump
That Tesla trunk in the front
Got at least fifty when I stunt
Left pocket fat, got a lump
Takin' all bets, nigga dump
I drink Bel-Air bottles after lunch
She gon' eat it all when I cum
Mob ties, chosen one
Two middle fingers, this for Trump

[Verse 1: Boosie Badazz]
Boosie Badazz
Hit the corner in the foreign, make these bitches scream
I've been drivin' shit like this since I was seventeen
Had a bitch thirty-five, I was seventeen
Tryin' to fit that in a pussy, I was stackin' green
Look at my neck
Bling, bling, bling, bling motherfucker
Boosie estates, I live a dream motherfucker
Big B's for the team, so you suckers get imitators
Smoking pounds in VIP, hope your club got ventilation
Made a bag this week, showed my ass this week
Bitch paid to give me head, a thousand cash this week
Thirty chains on my neck, I know my mom proud
We ain't ever had shit, but bitch we on now

[Chorus: Bae Bae Savo]
That Tesla trunk in the front
Got at least fifty when I stunt
Left pocket fat, got a lump
Takin' all bets, nigga dump
I drink Bel-Air bottles after lunch
She gon' eat it all when I cum
Mob ties, chosen one
Two middle fingers, this for Trump
That Tesla trunk in the front
Got at least fifty when I stunt
Left pocket fat, got a lump
Takin' all bets, nigga dump
I drink Bel-Air bottles after lunch
She gon' eat it all when I cum
Mob ties, chosen one
Two middle fingers, this for Trump

[Verse 2: Bae Bae Savo]
OH Ten, we the money team
Gold Rollies on the whole gang
Mob ties, that's another thing
Lines tied, that's another fiend
Gettin' top in the mansion
Just got done with her friend
Keep rockin', keep trappin'
And always count bands
I ain't gon' lie, bae I hustle
I get it right off the muscle
Hundred grand in the duffle
By tomorrow it'll double
I went to the store and dropped twenty-three songs
Trap nigga, I got two or three phones
Got a deal and now it's time to put on
Nuts holdin' up forty-three stones
I turned the trap to a factory
I got a Glock, ain't no jackin' me
Boosie with me, smoking rapper weed
Ballin' on 'em like an athlete (swish)
I turned the trap to a factory
I got a Glock, ain't no jackin' me
Boosie with me, smoking rapper weed
Ballin' on 'em like an athlete (swish)

[Chorus: Bae Bae Savo]
That Tesla trunk in the front
Got at least fifty when I stunt
Left pocket fat, got a lump
Takin' all bets, nigga dump
I drink Bel-Air bottles after lunch
She gon' eat it all when I cum
Mob ties, chosen one
Two middle fingers, this for Trump
That Tesla trunk in the front
Got at least fifty when I stunt
Left pocket fat, got a lump
Takin' all bets, nigga dump
I drink Bel-Air bottles after lunch
She gon' eat it all when I cum
Mob ties, chosen one
Two middle fingers, this for Trump
