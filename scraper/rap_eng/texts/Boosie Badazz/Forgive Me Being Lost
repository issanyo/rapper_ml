[Intro]
Shit, I don’t trust nobody
Shit, So many motherfuckers with motives
Shit, you don’t know who to trust
So fuck it, everybody suspect
(God, forgive me for being lost)
I don’t trust no motherfucker but Boosie Badazz

[Hook]
If rules get broke and niggas get crossed, forgive me for being lost
If pussy niggas get knocked off, forgive me for being lost
Daddy thugging, cousin hustling, out the bottle drinking, fuck it
God, forgive me for being lost

[Verse 1]
Momma struggling, Granny watch us, gangster potnas, oh my
Can’t afford it so we stole it, we were roaches, no lie
Saw my first body dead in the street at 8, oh my
Lil Glen just blew his brains out with his own four five
“Put it in the pot, make it lock ‘til it drop” is what my uncle told
Went to cocaine school and got an A-, honor roll
Love what my Mama showed to me and my brother (Love you Ma)
Tough love what my daddy showed made me and him tougher
Just waking up every morning made me out a hustler
‘Cause Granny house was the block where everybody sold butter
(Woke up to) People dying, bullets flying, mommas crying, oh my
80’s baby when it was coke crazy, no lie

[Hook]
Forgive me for being Lost
If pussy niggas get knocked off, forgive me for being lost
Daddy thugging, cousin hustling, out the bottle drinking, fuck it
God, forgive me for being lost

[Verse 2]
They tried to give me life, said I’m bad for the community (no)
How I’m supposed to feel about some people trying to ruin me? (cold)
Why should I stop for the cops if they shooting me?
While I get rich, my IRS friends using me (they’re using me)
Cold winters, why us? I need answers
If I sin, God forgive me, but my baby need pampers
My family need prayers, dear God, we’re on the blessed docket
Auntie got cancer, my little cousin, he on Crime Stoppers
I don’t know what you know, but all I know is what I learned
Pussy will kill you and 70 percent of these niggas turn
So my mind lost, I grew up fatal
Big Rope, Growl Nitti, this is Cain and Abel

[Hook]
