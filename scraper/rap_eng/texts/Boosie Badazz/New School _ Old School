Turn me up nigga
Burn it up nigga
Turn me up nigga
I'm goin' nuts nigga


[HOOK]
Turn up tha pro tools
It's a difference between tha new and tha old school
Turn up tha pro tools
I'm from tha old school


[VERSE 1]
Niggas use to take they licks
Now these niggas talk like a bitch
Niggas use to kill on tha love
Now everybody wanna take hits
In tha old school
They used to have 1 baby daddy, 6 kids
Now they got 5 baby daddy's, 6 kids
Don't even know who tha Dad is (real shit)
Niggas tellin' in tha jailhouse
Ain't too many real niggas in tha jailhouse (real talk)
Niggas used to stay true and bail out
Now these niggas point at you and tell out
New school ain't takin' no time
These new niggas testifyin'
These niggas pesticides
Niggas rappin' bout niggas
Keep rappin'
Let's see who's next to die
OG's don't front like they used to
Plugs don't come like they used to
New school, behind a bitch they'll shoot you
All this pussy shit
I ain't used to
The new school, new school

[HOOK]
Turn up tha pro tools
It's a difference between tha new and tha old school
Turn up tha pro tools
I'm from tha old school

[VERSE 2]
It used to be thug motivation
Now most of these thug niggas hatin'
Nigga used to put a lil' hat on
Now all these young niggas goin' naked
Shit I did it too
But I ain't like you
I ain't shit on tha crew
Old school niggas, man they dress like me
New school niggas, man they dress like you
They look uncomfortable
A crew ain't a crew, and it's hurtin' me
Grandmas now they 32 and 33
Niggas growin' up fast
Got Dads who done passed
Shit, I dont' know who won't murk me
Hoes used to hold a nigga down
Now all these hoes walkin' round thirsty
Police used to do they fuckin' job
Now they wanna shoot and Lil Turk me
The new school, new school

[HOOK]
Turn up tha pro tools
It's a difference between tha new and tha old school
Turn up tha pro tools
I'm from tha old school
