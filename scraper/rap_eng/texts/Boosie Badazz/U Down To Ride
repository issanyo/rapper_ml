You down to ride nigga
Man I was raised round thugs nigga
Man it's Lil Boosie the 2005 juvie
In the hemi with the tooley
I got them yellow eyes like my daddy eyes
With a look upon my face that say homicide
Come take a ride in Baton Rouge where I'm runnin' loose
With a gun in hand everyday like 2Pac I'm juiced
Got my lil nigga in the back seat with a black hood with a doja of that backwoods
Rubber bands on his fingers you know my nigga stack wood
