Used to sell that salt, me and my niggas
Now I sell my mouth, it be so lovely
For Christmas we roll 200 bands

I ride for you I die for you without no pussy ass
One call to waitress, hit me up and I'm gon' bust his ass
Thick or thin, right or wrong mane that's my fuckin' thugger
You beef with him, you beef with me, I kill you on the muscle
Gutta we be tryin' to get on light then muthafucka
Try and knock our hustle, it ain't nothing for a nigga to touch ya
Throughout the pain and the struggle we clique tight like brothers
I put my life in his hands because I trust him
Am I my brother's keeper, if you know me you know
100it with it, from day 1 until the day that we go
If I fuck witcha I'll duck witcha, till the graveyard days
Our secrets be our secrets, I'm real and I can't change
I'm loyal to my loved ones, and all my thug ones
Round hold me down and Jake oh my dawg, go rearrange his frown
I'm real with this shit, I'm loyal as lpyal as it get
For my nigga I'd do the time, get on the stand and tell a lie
