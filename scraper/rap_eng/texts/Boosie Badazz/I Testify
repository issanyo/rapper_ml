[Chorus]
This is what's wrong
No love at home
This is what's wrong
No jobs to work
This is what's wrong
Too many lying in church too many cry and hurt
Too many tryna lurch we be hurting too long
I testify
I testify
I tell the truth I hold my hand
I tell ya the feelings of every man in the sand
I tell you how they lost, lost and just don't understand
I talk for 'em let me help you understand

[Verse 1]
You know how many people have been 'round this mother fucker
People really scared 'round this mother fucker
If you don't find a program for the Mac and the Sam
They gonna grow up like Greg and his big brothers
Nigga tired of making music and they making money
Niggas spending money but they making none
Now your right in front of stoves cooking nose run
Mother fucker did I testify
You made money stayed in crime
Put they hands through the line
And Marvin Gaye said what's going on
Holies in Cali and Texas they high
You looking dumb like what's going on
I ain't hating on Trump I'm just saying
No day for some travel on some plane
We need get help us let
The water they be drinking is dirty as the rain
Black people man data left us in the rain
Shot us in the back when they saw are fucking heat
Got us on the back thought we couldn't shake back
We're on three strikes fuck Bill Clinton
We're in the hood tryna get gold well
Call is too high most of the rich never went
So why do we strive
You can have insurance but they still won't pay the whole bills for you
Wake up this life is too real for you

[Chorus]
This is what's wrong
No love in home
This is what's wrong
No jobs to work
This is what's wrong
Too many lying in church too many cry and hurt
Too many tryna lurch we be hurting too long
I testify
I testify
I tell the truth I hold my hand
I tell ya the feelings of every man in the sand
I tell you how they lost, lost and just don't understand
I talk for 'em let me help you understand

[Verse 2]
You know why the kids overweight right
Cuz all you let 'em do is play on that damn iPod
You don't let 'em run and play like they used to do back in the day
So they never lose weight when they try hard
Nigga tell 'em on the arm board
Got caught go whip a kush
You should see the pussy
I testify
Nigga said that he was hating so he ratted
That ain't why he ratted, ratted cuz the nigga he won't need a pussy
Race walls I don't wanna be a race car
Stay the fuck might get hit with a raycha
Cuz a bitch tell a lie for a dollar bill
The same bitch who would die for a dollar bill
That won't pay the teacher but It'll pay the judge
Where the cure for diabetes won't you get it up
You'll never get it up
They don't wanna lose niggas so they thinking 'bout the money
They don't give a fuck
I'm just tired of seeing wrong got the wrong
What I'm seeing with my eyes is a murder scene
White boy killed 9 black people in a church
He was hungry to get that bitch Burger King

[Chorus]
This is what's wrong
No love in home
This is what's wrong
No jobs to work
This is what's wrong
Too many lying in church too many cry and hurt
Too many tryna lurch we be hurting too long
I testify
I testify
I tell the truth I hold my hand
I tell ya the feelings of every man in the sand
I tell you how they lost, lost and just don't understand
I talk for 'em let me help you understand
I testify
