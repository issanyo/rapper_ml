[Chorus]

Some niggas wanna dutt tape me cause i'm cold blooded
Got too much paper now they hatin' but them hoes love it
Some niggas wanna dutt tape me cause i'm cold blooded
Got too much paper now they hatin' but them hoes love it
So niggas wanna DUTT!! tape me cause i'm cold blooded
Got too much paper now they hatin' but them hoes love it
Some niggas wanna dutt tape me cause i'm cold blooded
Got too much paper now they hatin' but them hoes love it


[Verse 1]

Niggas mean muggin' cause they must be thinking i'm fuckin they girl
Wanna touch me cause i'm paid and moving up in the fuckin world
I ain't a threat them niggas just hating and disrespecting to get a rep
That why I ain't been intimidated by no muhfuckin nigga yeah

I told my momma not to stress i gotta get them checks
Pull up in that two door Lex
Hit yo bitch with that text
Told her come and break that neck
I don't mean to flex
I just know that im the best
I just know im fuckin next
I will never settle for less
And if you tryna fuckin flex
Call up Mike0, Cello rambo
They gon hit you with the Tec, They gon wet you all in your neck
Make you lose your fuckin' breath
Snatch your bitch, make her my next
Lead her on then I'm off to the next, Fuck nigga

[Chorus]

Some niggas wanna dutt tape me cause i'm cold blooded
Got too much paper now they hatin' but them hoes love it
Some niggas wanna dutt tape me cause i'm cold blooded
Got too much paper now they hatin' but them hoes love it
So niggas wanna DUTT!! tape me cause i'm cold blooded
Got too much paper now they hatin' but them hoes love it
Some niggas wanna dutt tape me cause i'm cold blooded
Got too much paper now they hatin' but them hoes love it

[Outro]

But them hoes love it

But them hoes love it
(Never let a nigga take your shine)
But them hoes love it
(Or your motherfuckin' happiness)
But them hoes love it
