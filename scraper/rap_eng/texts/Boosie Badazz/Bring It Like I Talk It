[Boosie Talking]
I heard Master P say one time
He was a hustler, baller, gangsta, and a cap peeler
I don't know Master P like that
But me

[VERSE 1]
I can rap about tha trap, and be super cold wit' it
But you should see me work a microwave wit' that coke in it
You heard, smokin' on purple ease my mind
I keep a blunt up in my mouth
I smoke that loud all tha time
I'm tha truth in tha booth
I just don't rap to spit
Anything I say, believe me, I can back that shit
Boss Man tatted on me
Wit' a K wit' blood drippin'
It ain't tatted for decoration mane
It's tatted cus I'm wicked
Think I talk it, and don't walk it
Then you better ask my city
If you ask 'em, they gon' answer
They might answer wit' a whisper
When I say my heart good, I ain't tryna get no points
I did for people on tha streets, and did tha same from tha joint
Tha life I'm talkin bout, I lived that
Poverty baby
Stealing bikes, smokin' PCP, and home invasions
You heard Devil Get Up Off Me
Man that song was real
Devil been ridin' Boosie back since his teenage years
That's why I

[VERSE 2]
Yeah you heard me rap 'bout beef
And you heard me rap 'bout violence
It been nothing but beef and violence, every since they took Ivy
Talkin' body after body
Talkin' bout some of tha finest
Always rap that shut ya mouth talk
That's how I walk, silent
If you listen to my music
You will usually hear problems
Guess so
Got diabetes, and 5 baby mama's
I ain't stuntin' like I got it, man I really be grindin'
You can check my bank account or look at all these diamonds
(Bling)
When I say I lost a lot, I ain't lookin' for no hugs
But tha tatts on my body tell everything about it
I don't talk about tha pen, tryna build my fame (Shit no)
I talk about tha pen cus I lived that pain
Ima real street nigga who money can't change
Cus I'll give back all this shit to get back both my main mans
You can do a survey on me in tha streets I used to hang
100% gon tell ya nigga, Boosie ain't a game

I ain't nothing like these rappers man who studio gangstas
(Nah)
Me and every nigga in my studio gangstas
I ain't make tha song Crayola to paint a picture how I floss
Every car I talked about, in that song Boosie bought
Thought I was stuntin' bout my pool, and my 3 story house
1130 Palm paid nigga go and check it out
When I rap bout movin' work, I ain't tryna be a thug
Ask Magnum, ask Diggamon, any one of my old plugs
When I say that I be clean, I ain't feelin' myself (Nah)
Just go to Boosie pictures on tha fuckin' internet
Ima damn good Daddy and my kids love me
Every time they wit' they Daddy, they be fresh from head to feet
Thought I was playin when I told ya I had some strong sperm
Better look at my lil' girls, and sholl look at my lil' sons
When I say I buss' ya ass, dawg I really get it in
Whole label had cases (Trill)
All we do is win nigga
