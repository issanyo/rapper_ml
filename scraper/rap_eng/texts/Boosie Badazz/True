This is a story about this girl I fell in love with
True story, true story
This is a story about this girl that I met
True story, true story
This is a story about this girl that I'm forever in love wit'
This is a story about this girl that I could never forget
Never forget her

[VERSE 1]
Never gon' forget tha day
First time I saw ya
Know some girls play hard to get
But shit she played harder
Had a smile that made me weak
Had 2 solids just like me
She was only 15, body like she 23
Was it love at first sight?
It sholl felt like it that to me
First time we sexed, Boosie was speechless
All I could say is OMG
The love only increased as she pushed out my oldest child
(Ivy)
Tears and smiles
That's why I could never forget her
Played on her, made other babies on her
In tha projects, me and you
Eggs and rice every morning
All night on tha corner sellin' D
Tryna buy something sweet for you
Then we elevated to a big ol' mansion
Ain't that some shit
Boosie tat all over her bodyframe
Ain't that my bitch
Gon' always love her
Sat in prison, and I was missin' her
Lookin' at her photos in my cell, a sad prisoner
Even though she broke the code
Ratted, and hurt my soul (damn)
Ima always have love for Walnita
Lord knows
Look

[VERSE 2]
Now this next girl (True story)
She fucked up my whole world
Called me by my first name (Torrance)
Different from other girls
We both grew up around gangsta shit
So instantly we clicked
Fell hard for each other, so she was instantly my bitch
But she was slick, she was a cheater
But I looked over so much
Never could turn my back, like I was 'pose do her
We switched schools
I switched girls, she switched dudes
It was crazy
But when we see each other, she was back my ol' lady
And everybody knew about Boosie and Black
(Boosie mess wit Nicole)
Remember I cried to ya Mama, Ms. Debra
Tellin' her to tell you to come back
Couple years past, we moved in
I had 3, ain't want another so I'm like no
Now we ruined (Won't be the same)
The love we shared
I must admit, it was all that
Ain't shit changed cuz when I see you, It come all back
You still my dawg Black
You got a fam, I got a fam
Gon' always love ya
But fuck it, I'm just gon' fall back

[HOOK 2]
Once you got a past with somebody like that
It's hard to forget them (Ya'll been through so much)
No matter, it don't matter who you wit'
You gon' always love them (Don't even matter you love 'em)
True love it don't never never end
Even if you try to hold back (It don't end)
Forever in love wit' you girl, and I want you to know that
True story, true story
