[Intro: Lil Boosie]
Uh-oh, you know what time is
Say Ivy, nigga. Do your thing nigga
You still with us, believe that

[Verse 1: Lil Ivy]
I lone riding on a hunt, with a rocket launcher
On my lap is a mac, a lil pocket monster
Looking for some bitch niggas with some bitch ways
I ain't shit, shaved, or bathe in 'bout six days
My sick ways was handed down from bucking nigga
You still alive to hear this song, then you lucky nigga
Fuck it nigga, we can meet in front of your house
Cause I finna grab this heat and run in your house
You ain't 'bout what we 'bout, you drugged up
We thugged up and y'all 'bout to get slugged up
We mugged up in the club with this slugsta
That's Lil Ivy in the building with his slug tucked

[Outro: Lil Ivy]
I'm a gangsta with some stars in the street game
'Bout to introduce you to the fucking sleep game
So peep, bang! Do the math and watch your ass (Fuck)
You fucking with a gangsta that's for sure gon' blast, nigga!
