[Hook x2: ]
Look I'm on that five foot seven with the heart of a lion
Creep like a tiger and I stomp like a giant
Had to feed myself, so a nigga so defiant
Take ya to meet your maker nigga and I ainâ€™t lyin'

[Verse 1: ]
I'm on that five foot seven like a lion I'm raw
They be like how people talk bout you I thought that you was tall
No I ain't tall but I got a very loud growl
The look up in my eye make a nigga bow down
I thugged in the pen round several convicted felons
Five foot seven, heart big as a watermelon
Underrated my whole life, I love pressure
Love the Blood like a vampire, I love to wet ya nigga
Had to feed myself because my daddy wasn't home
Went from a young dope dealer to a Don Corleone
I float like a butterfly and sting like a bee
Only thing I'm scared of in this world is catching HIV
Man I creep like a tiger, never know when I'm coming
I wish a nigga would try to stop me from stuntin'
This ain't no kiddie pool
Man it's that shark infested waters
When niggas get rid of you, I'm Mr. T I pity the fool
Get it dude

[Hook x2: ]

[Verse 2: ]
Man I'm small but my dick hard, ask my family ask my friends
Don't believe me, tell your doctor X-Ray my chest then
Everything I got in this world I had to earn it
I'm cut from shit like leather, you can't tear it you gotta burn it
I supersoak you pussy mothafuckas like the old days
Telling you Lil daddy you don't wanna see my old ways
Say what's on my mind even if it's good or ugly
Never back down and that's why my fam love me
Daddy wasn't home made me ignorant, defiant
Spit it from the heart I'm a muthafuckin' giant
Spit it from the heart while these other rappers lying
Bragging bout their hustle, ain't never cooked up a nine piece
Weak niggas try me, knowing I don't play round
Knowing I'm on that Beanie Sigel shit, get down or lay down
Yeah you get a six pack tall with muscles and all that
But when it go down you, bow down bitch where your heart at?

[Hook x2: ]

[Verse 3: ]
Man I'm small, with a soft voice, I'm an animal, I'm telling you
Soft voice that got power like Hannibal Lecter
When I step off in the room you gon' feel my presence
No matter what they say bout Boosie, I been a legend
I don't back down, I don't play around man ask somebody bout me
I been a leader since the playground been shot calling
Hustle with the best uh, but at all the rest of 'em
Let me chill they might be listening, you know they tryna get me
Fuck where you from it's how you come I fuck with real niggas
He got a chopper, I got a pistol but my heart bigger
What's up? What's happening? It's bigger than this rapping
Snatch my chain, I bust your brain, and that's my chain reaction
Now I'm bout that scrapping, little man complex
Ask somebody from Roosevelt Street projects
Freedom or jail I cause hell I'm defiant
Creep like a tiger and I stomp like a giant
