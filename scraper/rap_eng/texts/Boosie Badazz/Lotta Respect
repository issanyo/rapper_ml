[Verse 1: Offset]
Respect me like Aretha Franklin
Respect the fact that I got Benjamin Franklins
Living out the bando, trap out the vacant
Doctor Offset, I got a lot of patients
When I got out of jail I wasn’t a free agent
You can hate that I’m rich, I appreciate it
Thanking my mama, look what you created
I’m in the PJ, headed to Jamaica
Maison Margielas, safari, a gator
You sweet like candy, rob you now or later
Call Domingo, he annihilate you
Don’t press my buttons, I will violate you
Bald head Lamborghini, cancer patients
Diamonds shining, you hallucinating
Looking at hundreds, that’s my motivation
Used to have chickens in the bando basement
Ain’t talking bout money, ain’t no conversation
Grab the Pyrex and we whipping Caucasian
Tray One got the seals like we in the Navy
They respect me, they know I can still ship a baby

[Hook: Boosie Badazz &Quavo]

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Got a whole lotta, got a whole chopper
Coroner, can’t call the doctor
Ride all night, we gone solve the problem
I, I, I got respect, fuck busting them checks, mister finesse
Know I’m grinding in my neighborhood
Ain’t nothing but a real ass nigga
Street nigga from the neighborhood
Have respect, on the set selling yayo
Bust a nigga’s face up with the four four
[?] like soldiers do, newspaper say we standing over you
We just do what we 'posed to do
Use it every time we pull it
Big chains on, I’m a gold mouth bullet
30 in the clip, man the whole bar feel it
In the dirt, my respect gon' put ya
Last nigga tried but he couldn’t
Dog every ho who give me pussy
Outlaw, I don’t know another way to put it
Got respect nigga!

Pull up with choppers just for respect (respect)
I pull up in your hood 'cause I got respect (hood)
AK-47 kill tech (raow)
Don’t nobody s’posed to know bout that (nobody)
Plug dropping off the anthrax (thrax)
My young niggas trap out of fanny packs (fanny pack)
You got to respect that I took your ho (woo!)
Took her to the top floor then I hit from the back (uh!)
Migos and Boosie pull up, Rari's back to back (skrt)
Damn, they having a heart attack (damn)
Young rich nigga, yeah we count millions (M&M's)
Passin' hundred dollars to the children (here)
You got to respect how we living (respect it)
Got the choppers out nigga, no feelings (rah)
'Til a nigga might get out of business (business)
Then a young nigga handling business (handle business)
Baow, kraow, no witness (no)
I’m in the lab, Quavo the chemist (wooh, whip!)
On the Nawf I was Quavo the menace (uh)

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Takeoff
They respect a young nigga 'cause I can paint a perfect picture, no Mona Lisa (I can)
Go cross the country, don’t need a Visa
I’m smoking on OG, you smoking sativa (gas)
So many diamonds on my neck a nigga caught the measles
The critics writin' say that Migos bigger than the Beatles
Take a trip to put the work [?] in Costa Rica
Snow bunnies in the lab, been geeking, I got jungle fever
I take the pot, no Billie Jean, but I got to beat it
Rap shit, Floyd Money Mayweather, we undefeated
Chopper [?], scary nigga, jeepers creepers
In the kitchen whipping the chicken, I’m selling chicken tenders
Burglar bar doors trapping out the windows
30 round extension hanging from my pistol
Once that hollow hit you it’ll rip your tissue
You an internet gangster, sending shots subliminal
I’m in the bando with the criminals
So many narcotics, nigga need tentacles
Wake up in the morning, say my blessing
Put my Migos chain on, my diamonds screaming Peekaboo

[Hook: Boosie Badazz &Quavo]
Got a whole lotta lotta, got a whole lotta lotta respect
Got a whole lot (nigga!)
Got a whole lotta lotta, got a whole lotta lotta respect
