[Intro]
Them niggas did that for the boss man (x2)
Boosie I got you, got you, got you, got you

[Hook]
Boosie I got you, got you.. Boosie I got you, got you.... (x2)

[Verse 1: ?]
OG grinding, OG gonna stomp ya
I'm that old nigga with that ugly ass revolver
Niggas talking shit but ain't ready to die
Choppers with a hundred rounds ready to fly

[Verse 2: Ghost]
Ghost coming like a ghost, you can't see me 'til I'm on ya
Slip the clip in, rip up the whole corner
Tell boss man everything will be alright
We coming through the night and we gone put it in they life

[Verse 3: ?]
And real talk, I'm the type to let the irons fought when it's time boss, closed casket
Rep I do it for the boss man, broad day with a K, I set it off man
I ain't no stand down nigga, I pull these triggers to erase these niggas
Hollow head hit ya, amber lamps come and get ya
And I ain't tripping on the cost man I do it for the boss man

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Bleek]
It's Bleek and I bang shit, right hand man shit
Cock it back and split 'em when they fuck with my nigga
Track life bitch, been together since babies
Try'na' jack Hatch, bitch you must be crazy
That down for life shit, that brother-brother shit
I feel you trying to jack and I'm upping on a bitch
That down for life shit, that brother-brother shit
I feel you trying to jack and I'm upping on a bitch

[Verse 5: Marlo Mike]
Marlo Mike bitch, and I'm insane in the brain (for real)
Bust a nigga ass if they fuck with Badazz
Do it out of love, I don't need no green
Straight killed a nigga, I ain't nothing but fifteen
Marlo

[Verse 6: Big Loc]
I'm Big Loc and I clean for the bossman
And when he clucking I get lean for the bossman
And when he wrinkled I iron jeans for the bossman
Serving fiends for the bossman
I done done it all, nigga

[Hook]
[Verse 7: Lil Boosie]
Now these last works from the boss man, and his first words
Were killing niggas who hating on me, what they deserve
Bleek like he'll do it on GP, cause he's my dawg
One phone call, job done
For the boss man
If I got to leave a minute, handle situation
Grind hard put a smile on my kids faces
Retaliation but it's only when the boss call
Listen close and take notes when the boss talks
He tell ya spark spark, chill chill, kill kill
One call he made Bun, didn't he keep it real?
So when he flash you gotta take it sometimes
You know your boss got a lot on his mind, you know your boss grind
Lot of niggas can't be in my shoes, (nah) lotta niggas can't control they goons
We catch you chilling at the room, or outside at noon, and it's chick, chicka-chicka BOOM
For the Boss Man

[Hook 4]
