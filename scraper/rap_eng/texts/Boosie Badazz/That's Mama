[Intro]
I'ma send this song to all the beautiful mothers across the world tonight
High and low, far and near
Now I'ma send this to this one mother
My mother, Miss Connie, love her to death
All the stuff I done put you through, no song repays for it out there
But I tried
For you, Mama

[Chorus]
This for Mama, that woman
This for Mama, that woman
When he was gone we had Mama
Just that woman
All alone, me and Mama
This for Mama (Love you, Mama), huh

[Verse 1]
Kissin' me and huggin' me, huh
That's Mama, that's Mama
Always tryna fuss with me
That's Mama, yeah, that's Mama
Without you there would be no me (Without you)
Without Mama, huh (Without Mama)
Gave me my bottle (Protected me)
Made sure I swallowed (Raised me)
Raised me and that bottle, huh
Me, TQ, and Mama (Me, TQ, and Mama)
Always at my games (Always at my games)
I know I'm gon' see Mama (Know I'm gon' see Mama)
Workin' two jobs a week, just so we eat, huh
That's Mama (That's my Mama, yeah)
They tried to shit on my fame
Who spoke up for my name? (She did)
My mama, huh

[Chorus]
This for Mama (This for Mama), that woman (This for that woman)
This for Mama (This for Mama), that woman (This for that woman)
When he was gone we had Mama (When he was gone we had Mama)
Just that woman (Put your hands up if you love your mama)
All alone, me and Mama (Mama)
This for Mama

[Verse 2]
Her cigarettes and her lighter, huh
Slow down, Mama (Please slow down, Mama)
Always readin' that Bible (Always readin' those words, huh)
God help Mama (God, help Mama)
I'm back in trouble, she cried (Boose in trouble again, huh)
Don't cry, Mama
My friends, they keep on dyin' (My friends, they keep on dyin', dyin')
I ask Mama, why, Mama? (I ask Mama)
No more askin' for no favors (we ain't gotta ask cheaper for nothin' no more
We straight now, Mama, we straight)
No more askin' for no rides (No more askin' for no rides
Motherfuckers ain't wanna give me a ride)
You see me now, Ma, you can smile (You see me now, Ma, you smile
Hope you happy, 'cause yesterday I saw you)
You ain't smiled in a while (Like you ain't smiled in a while, Connie, huh)
This for you, Mama, this for you

[Chorus]
This for Mama (I love Mama), that woman (I love that woman)
This for Mama (Love Mama), that woman (Ooh, I love that woman)
When he was gone we had Mama (Daddy was gone, we called Mama)
Just that woman (Just that woman)
All alone, me and Mama (Yeah, all alone, me and Mama)
This for Mama (This for that woman, Connie)

[Interlude]
In the pen, she can't feed me (In the pen, she can't feed me)
My mama, my mama
Brought my kids every time (Brought my kids every time)
My mama, my mama
Her and my lawyer on the TV (Who that lady is right there, actin' like that?)
That's my mama (That's my mama)
My soldier, my soldier

[Outro]
This for my mama
This a special song 'cause
Everybody ain't got no mama
Straight up
Mama
