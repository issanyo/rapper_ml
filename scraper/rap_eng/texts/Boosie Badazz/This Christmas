[Intro]
This Christmas
I'ma send this out to my niggas locked up
My niggas in Hunts, my niggas in DC, out in Angola
My niggas in the fed joint
(Won't be like the others)
I know you're prayin', nigga, straight up

[Chorus]
This Christmas won't be like the others (Won't be like the others)
Bells'll still be ringin', children still be singin' (Songs)
But it won't be the same at all (Why?)
'Cause I done let my people down
Prison walls, they closin' in (In)
Try my best to shed no tears (None)
But they fall when holidays get here, this Christmas

[Verse 1]
They just gave lil' Bobby 40 'fore Christmas time (Damn, Bobby)
Brought his baby mama to tears right 'fore Christmas time
And it's niggas on the street, they barely pick up the line
His dawg who ridin' with him for real, he fightin' a dime
This the life and times
Don't get a visit, he ready to fight, G a crash dummy (Real crash)
And he got some niggas gon' listen to him, who'll crash for him
Last year he was ballin', know he the name all them hoes was callin' for
Got his time, now they doggin' woe, he sleep on 'signment so
We both look out the window as the Christmas carol jingle (Man)
Holiday spirits got us freakin', wanna mingle (What up, girl?), and tangle (Tangle)
It's Christmas time, so girl don't be no stranger
God like this was what you get for bein' a gangster (Gangster)
(That's cold, you heard me?)

[Chorus]
This Christmas won't be like the others (Won't be like the others)
Bells'll still be ringin', children still be singin' (Songs)
But it won't be the same at all (Won't be the same at all)
'Cause I done let my people down
Prison walls, they closin' in (In)
Try my best to shed no tears (Man)
But they fall when holidays get here, this Christmas

[Verse 2]
It got some people ain't gon' get much for Christmas, huh
It got some people ain't gon' get nothin' for Christmas, Lord
I miss my kids, I need the weed for Christmas (I need the weed for Christmas)
Two niggas on side me ain't even believe in Christmas (Oh Lord)
So I light me a stick, get on the phone, talk to my bitch
Then I go jump in the shower and play with my dick
Push-ups when I jump out that bitch
After that, go chop it up with the clique
I got the tooly, you know it's gon' hit
Yeah, I got the tooly, you know it's gon' hit
But I'd rather a bitch who taste just like a tuna
Open the mail, it's a letter from Ruger
We both on a body, they say he my shooter
I'm tellin' them how these lil' hoes
They been runnin' and fuckin' with niggas who we wanna shoot up
Come on her hard, no one smoother and cooler
Chains on my neck like I got me a jeweler
Big old respect, talkin' Telly and Boosie
And my thug nigga hauled off and loose it
This shit fucked up

[Chorus]
This Christmas won't be like the others (This for my niggas doin' 20 and 30 years and shit, ain't got no outdate)
Bells'll still be ringin', children still be singin' (Free BG, niggas in Angola, C-Murder)
But it won't be the same at all (Niggas in San Quentin)
'Cause I done let my people down (Free Tooly, nigga, niggas in the feds, free Flava)
Prison walls, they closin' in (Kentucky, free Craig, niggas in Texas)
Try my best to shed no tears (Niggas down the road)
But they fall when holidays get here, this Christmas (All my niggas down the road, nigga, yeah)

[Outro]
Hold your head, nigga
Don't get a visit, he ready to crash
Hold your head, nigga
Work on your case if you go to the bed
Savage Holidays (Hold your head, Lil Titan)
You gotta stay strong on them holidays, for real
