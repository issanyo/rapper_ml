[Verse 1]
Wake up and smell the coffee, it's a new nigga in town
Gotta shake them haters off me, you know how boosie get down
And I'm anti-social nigga, don't fuck with none of you clowns
You play some games nigga? Well I gotta hundred some rounds
I drop hit after hit, (whaaaan) and it's amazing
Jump off in that coogi, now lil boosie in a matrix
Ask about me nigga, I live this
If it's coming out my mouth, it's some real shit
A soulja but not like soulja boy, I can't dance
Because I keep a big knot in my pants, straight up
You want some big shit? (call me) some beef shit? (call me)
My dog, it's easy to see

[Hook]
I got undeniable talent
I'm a fool with this rapping

[Verse 2]
When I step off in the room, it's a full moon
The lights on if I got my ice on
Looking like a kingpin, jewelry like slick rick
Keyshia Cole seen me, she said "Boosie that's too much shit"
Boosie he be thugging, hat to the back
Rolling through the trap with the strap in my lap
Peter pan fit, my favorite color green
When the cameras say action, you see some shit you never seen
Bad bitches love me, they want to rip me out the frame
And I make they pussy jump out they drawers into my hands
Got my name on my chain, let you know it's me
I-10 on my neck as a memory
2 cars deep, and then that chain in that gat
But I'll be damned if that money gone change me
I'm gonna tell 'em I'm a beast (ha ha ha)
