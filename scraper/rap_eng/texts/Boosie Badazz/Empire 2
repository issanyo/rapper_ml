[Intro]
My empire, will not be denied
Must I say it again?
My empire will not be denied

[Verse  1]
I'm a real street nigga, who ain't lovin' the fame
I can't help it everywhere I go they knowin' my name
Gold teeth, gold chain, all gold everything
Cold pictures, old pictures with that Tec in my hand
Boosie Badazz, nigga, I'm the best in the game
How you the best in the game?
No one else in my lane
Tonight I'm fuckin' you, I'm 'bout that
So girl get your mind right
I'll fuck you and your girl if you don't want to fuck your girl
You ain't gonna find too many niggas off the chain like me
Diamond ring, piece and chain
Built hard like concrete
Like Zoes my squad deep
Yeah, we official
At the club, we just want pussy
But boy we ain't pussy
Gon' be mad cause I'm flexin'
Diamond I'm shinin' from Texas
Every girl that I'm sexin'
I'm a real bitch, blessin'
And I got money to blow, but I'm stackin' my Jacksons
But my squad 'bout murder
And we packing the plastic

[Interlude]
There's no stoppin' my empire
We finessin' now
There's no stoppin' my empire
Yo, B-Will get at these niggas

[Verse 2]
When I'm in Texas I keep my Texas phone
When I'm in Memphis, hit my Memphis phone
Pull up in Emmit, won't take that long
Don't fuck your bae at home, and I know I'm wrong
Funny shit 'bout it, shit won't take that long
I'm Tyrone, pimpin' on my mobile phone
When I got my Rollie on
It's dumb shit, and precious stones
To you, she a bad bitch, to me she's just a sexy song
Bitch, don't treat my Lexus wrong
Who the fuck you flexin' on?
I bought that!
I know these niggas hatin', nigga
I caught that!
I know you see me skatin', nigga
Four-five for shady nigga
Automatic chopper, think I'm crazy, nigga
Air Max and cigarettes
I ain't met a nigga yet that spit this
It's winter fresh, and keeps this bitch [?]
I could never try to turn a stripper to a [?]
Jack the Ripper slippers, red bottoms when I walk the set

[Verse 3]
You are not the plug, bitch you just a drug addict
Eatin' every rapper boy you better check the attic
I been on top for a minute like [?]
Way up for a while and I do not need ladders, little nigga
Money so tall you could [?] to it
Even better, ask me for it lil nigga
Fuck with the kid, cause I ball now
Baby girl you gon' get this dick in the nighttime (nighttime)
Since you gonna sleep on the kid
You don't suck dick baby girl, it's the right time (right time)
(For real, for real)
And I'm talkin' [?] status
Paint drippin', style drippin'
I need a [?] napkin
I used to laugh but now they raise whenever we pass them
The coup has no roof so you can't imagine
The [?] the lime light, I see everyday
But you gotta remember at the end of the day
That man, this is my passion
