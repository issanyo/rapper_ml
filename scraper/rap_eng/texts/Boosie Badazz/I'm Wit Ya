[Verse 1]
Turn me up thug nigga, turn me up
You know I’m bout to thug with ya
You’re probably sitting in your Caddy or your Caprice right now
Your head smoking
Just lost on the dice, bitch keep calling your phone, you don’t want to talk
Don’t worry nigga, you gon see better days coming
Fitted head to toe, with them new Js on, stunting
I know today a day that you never seen coming
Your nigga got his time, his mama calling, you’re crying
Let me thug with you, I know that feeling
Block ain’t even bumping
Can’t stay out the rear view, you got bitch worries
Niggas at your head, you’re paranoid
Everywhere they go, they staring hard

[Hook]
I’m wit you, I’m wit you, I’m wit you
I be that nigga on your side when your well runs dry
Boosie wit you, I’m with you, I’m with you
I be that nigga who pull up when you go on E
Nigga I’m wit you, I know that feeling
Nigga I’m wit you, I know that feeling
Nigga I’m wit you, I know that feeling
I-I know that feeling, nigga I’m wit you
I know, I-I know
Know that feeling, I know that feeling
Nigga I’m

[Verse 2]
Lights off, cold water
Mama getting stares from her son and her daughter
Saw the slot machine and couldn’t stop putting in quarters
Kids blame mama cause they never had a father
Let me thug wit you, I know the game
Know how to make mistakes you can’t explain
This for that teenager who fourteen but pussy hot
Got gonorrhea now she too scared to go see the doctor
[?] That'll slow her down, you probably listening to me now
I’m going through some real shit
Granny in the hospital and she real sick
Attitude with everybody being a real bitch
Cause losing your daddy you ain’t ready to deal with

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
When it all falls down, I know that feeling
When it ain’t too many left to call, I know that feeling
When your dog turn small, same law
And hatred from these racists ring loud
I done witnessed this shit like an old time movie, no question
Part of my life was like an old time Western
Now let me thug with you baby, I know how it be
Can you pass a couple stacks cause you love to be clean
Niggas stealing out the pot, now you watching your team
People talking down on you, and they knocking your dream
Hustling till the sun rise, on the block with the fiends
Strapped tight, I understand, you remind me of me

[Hook]
