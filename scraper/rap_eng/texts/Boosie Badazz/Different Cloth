[Intro]
Cut cut cut what they talking about?

[Hook]
Cut cut cut from a cloth that don't even come out
You can't order it, you just gotta be part of it (different breed nigga)
Cut from a cloth that don't even come out
Where we take it to the grave we don't talk
Lot of people living they won't understand the baggage
Probably because we cut from different fucking fabric

[Verse 1]
He did what? He post the lady he think nasty
And we don't leak these hoes nudes, we jack off to they shit
Too much of liquor too many pistols that's off in this bitch
In the back room bucking and jumping but never talk in this bitch
Never walking around like "Who want to go to war 'round this bitch?"
Because war it slow your money up I'm trying to get your money up
Take care of them kids in the hood motivate all the real
Always do for the old folks, this the man right chea
I got the streets and I ain't sharing till the let B.G. go
I been a different type of lil one since my day with C-Loc

[Hook]
Bitch i'm cut from a clothe that don't even come out
You can't order it, you just gotta be part of it (different breed nigga)
Cut from a clothe that don't even come out
Where we take it to the grave we don't talk (different breed nigga)

[Verse 2]
My son ain't scared of nothing when he was born I was gone
In Baton Rouge all alone named him Micheal Carleone (boss)
I raised him head up right is right wrong is wrong
Look a man in his eye and bitch stop dancing to that song (boy)
I raised his brother around me back then it was on
Now Ray-Ray watch his friends cause he know what went down
His older brother Tootie he been hanging since the block
Four deep, back seat on top his uncle in the drop
"We don't fuck with police son they ain't your friend"
That's what my daddy told me "son they ain't your friend"
This the way I raise my children You ain't going to be no pussy
And you ain't going to be no hoes
And yall might have me up the road
Falling for women why half these niggas up the road
Just keep it 100 in know plenty who ain't 100
On Instagram stunting but ain't about spending on nothing
My son 14 I ain't got to go get him shit
He be like pops "ole girl sucked my dick" (oh you fucking now nigga)

[Hook]
Cut from a clothe that don't even come out
You can't order it, you just gotta be part of it (different breed nigga)
Cut from a clothe that don't even come out
Where we take it to the grave we don't talk (different breed nigga)

[Verse 3]
Nigga swung on me and Mugzi and tried to hit us
Dog you got that see you seen they caught us slipping
We ain't go down town pointing at a nigga talking about who did it
We ASAP'd our business like some niggas out that city
This that seven ward meal nigga we going to get that meal nigga
Uptown Wild Telly Hankton Shake that L
Im going to get diamond J because i know he'll do an L with you
My nigga D

[Outro]
Cut from a clothe (this shit don't even come out nigga)
Cut from a clothe (this shit don't even come out no more)
Cut from a clothe (this shit don't even come out no more)
Cut from a clothe (this shit don't even come out nigga)
