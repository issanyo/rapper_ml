[Chorus:]
You gotta hold me down [x6]
How deep... tell Me [x2]
How deep is yo love
How deep How deep how deep is your love

[Verse 1:]
Would u baby sit some kids that ain't even yurs
Be at court every morning with them bad nervs
Break yo nigga off swiftly on the first an third
Stick by ya nigga ride or die fuck what ya heard
Would u swerv on the passenger side
If a nigga get to trippin would you bust the 4-5 so he caint die
Would u stick by nigga with no blame on
If he had another baby would u change on would u change on
A lot a hoes b wantin a rang up on they finger
But they ain't real an they showl ain't gangsta
Gotta be more than just a bust it baby
Thru the rain an all the pain gotta trust ya baby
From november to december we been tripin lately
Thought goin thru my mind that u slipin baby
Love yo nigga mane no matter what his occupation
Fuckthem skezy ass hoes you his old lady an das the bitness

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Smell like onion rings would she do half the things she don 2 me
100 100 100 how I like my woman call her rubber band boosie when she wrap my money
Do you sqeeze yo nigga tight when he leave the house
Break him aff yo whole taxes if his money shawt
Girl how you ride
Keep it real with yo nigga pop a pill with yo nigga pack you bags in NY an get a deal with yo nigga
Momma told me if she love me she'll b bak... she might not trust you again but she'll be bak
You go hard for yo nigga live large with yo nigga take a charge for yo nigga man shout out to taquila
Cookin meals keep his belly right
Give em head an fie pussy like every night dat what dey like
Go to the doctor tell da doctor dat yo throat get a prescription just so yo lil nigga can sip purp

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Already got the message how it's goin down
Since I been doin my thang you don't come around
I know I ain't been spending time like I'm supposed ta
But you the only one I love like I love that doja suck
If I told u was the only one would you believe it
If I was feanin for that pussy would ya stunt an tease me
If I was locked off in a cell would you come an see me
Say baby I know you doin ya best to try to please me
Promise to stick by me I know she ain't bout violence but if the gay shit kick off I know she silent
When I was lose on the run she was right there with me
When it come to love we go deep she 100 not 50
If it cum down to it she'll hit the road an go get it
Right or wrong thick or thin she gone still be with it so tell me what the bitness is I'm just tryna run into an tell ya how deep it is
