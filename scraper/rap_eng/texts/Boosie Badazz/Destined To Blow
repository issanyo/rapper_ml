Ima send this song out to my Grandmother
Cuz my Grandmother always said I was special

[HOOK]
I was destined to blow 5x
Wit’ no pressure I blow
I was destined to blow

[VERSE 1]
I was destined to blow
500 a show
To 100 a show
Just a couple more 0s
I drop me a classic (Gangsta Musik)
Got a couple more hoes
From ballin’ to prison
To back out chea livin’
To pushin’ a Rolls
You ain’t know I got my own clothes nigga
Big boss swag like a dope dealer
Granny used to say I was a go getter
Cold nigga since 4 nigga
Get right back up if I fall off tha 4 wheeler
My mind is a business
My grind is ridiculous
Had a mansion 4 years fo’ I went to jail
Ask my cousin Trell
My grind is tha sickest
I cried all tha tears
You put me through pain
You act like “I’m ready to ride”
Then you rise me again
I’m destined for fame
I murdered tha game
Sumin’ bout Boosie
He a fool huh
Teachers ain’t wanna help a clown
Stupid ass bitch
Who tha fool now?
I been a go getter
No stoppin’ me
My favorite child game was Monopoly
Tha streets are for Boosie
They knockin’ me
These dirty polices they PAC’n me
My nieces and nephews are watchin’ me
When GOD need examples
He call for me
These angels in heaven
They walk wit’ me
Talk wit’ me
Lettin’ me know

[HOOK]
I was destined to blow 5x
Wit’ no pressure I blow
I was destined to blow

[VERSE 2]
Dreamed this on my desk back in middle school
Way before I ever had a check nigga
Light neck, no jewelry on my neck nigga
Make me take the jewelry off ya neck nigga
Used to watch, and observe
Used to watch, and I learned
Then I smoked it
And it showed me devils and horses
And I got off tha sherm
16 on tha sherm
Made a lot of money talkin’ real shit to tha ghetto
Boosie Badazz nigga
Lot of niggas prayed on my downfall
You a sad ass nigga
You a mad ass nigga
And you talk shit
What tha fuck you look like jumpin’ on a boss dick
10 big bedrooms, big boss shit
Big pool fit tha whole damn crew
Rick Ross shit
I thought Jamaica, Bahamas
While my niggas thought that Biloxi was everything
I had a different dream
Diamonds, Bizatine
Jugs of promethazine
Bitch you ain’t gon’ take shit from me
I remember my Daddy tellin’ me
Don’t quit on me
My Granny was special
Cuz she loved me

[HOOK]
I was destined to blow 5x
Wit’ no pressure I blow
I was destined to blow

[VERSE 3]
I’m lucky when shakin’ them shakes
7 in tha door
Pick my money up
I’m so clean
I’m hurtin’ my hatas
Boy I’m tha man, I don’t give a fuck
This GOD plan, Ima live it up
Stressin’ as a young buck
To poppin’ X wit’ Young Buck
Fuck shoe box money nigga
Tryna fill a dump truck
Boy you can’t catch me
I’m one up
I got on my knees
And I told him my pain
I thanked him for every chain
This bible and chain
And this heavy lil name
Diamonds, I be shinin’
I was destined to blow
Shinin'!
