[Talking]
This Boosie Bad Azz, and lemme tell you somethin
When I was 16 or 17, my momma looked at me and she said
"Boosie, son... get on yo mothafuckin shit, nigga!"
[Hook]
Big money! I like it
I used to have hoes who triflin'
Now I got pros who dykin'
And it's excitin, it's excitin'

[Verse 1- Lil' Boosie]
I had to get my shit together mayne, I didn't like it
I had too many hoes who triflin
Dirty shell toes and Nike's
I didn't like it. It wasn't excitin
Until I got money, I got icy
Hoes got right, they got feisty
Turk put me in the studio, I kept writin
Droppin that gangsta shit, and it's excitin
Purple after purple nigga, we kept lightin
Concert after concert mayne, we kept flightin
We struck the world real quick like lightning
You pussy ass rap niggas, stop bitin
I used to fuck with little girls with little minds who wasn't grown yet
So before you wear a thong, get yo pussy in check
Yo hygiene a mothafucka, you 'sposed to stay smellin right
Especially if you got a nigga with money, that's what he like

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2- Lil' Boosie]
And all of my shows be excitin
Hoes grabbin on my dick, wanna bite it
Didn't yo momma teach you better? You triflin
Just Chill, after the show you can lick me like icing
Money make yo life better so fuck what they say
Girls be more G'd up everytime they look in ya face
She used to kiss me on my neck (uh huh)
Now she suck me til that pussy get wet (uh huh)
I remember way back when I used to fuck rats
When they wore them daisy dukes, had that pussy sittin fat
Now a nigga gettin stacks, I do whatever I like
I'll hit em Asian, Black or White, I have my pleasure with dykes
I'm first class on every flight, I'm a big dog, nigga
At the Super Bowl, I'm front row. Where's y'all niggas?
I used to fuck with hoes who like to cut ya tires up
Now I'm breaded and they can't even get a nut

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3- Webbie]
I been livin like a tymer, and I like it
Hittin niggas baby mommas and they wifey
With the rims all shiny, dressed nicely
'Bauds wit the white tee, fresh white tee
Nice white two-seat or I might be
New SUV, doin 90
Lookin for the right weed for the right fee
Hit it once or twice, B... my eyes tightening
Now I'm goin faster, I swerved slightly
To the left lane then I came back right
.357 clutched tightly cuz it might be
My night, you know we got niggas dyin nightly
Tonight I'm with a nice freak, she had white sheets
Clean up, lick a nigga nuts cuz she like me
Find another me up in the streets is unlikely
Don't hit me on the phone later on cuz I might be gone

Chorus 2x
