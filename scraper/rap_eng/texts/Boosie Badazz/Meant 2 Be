[Intro: Lil Snupe]
Lil Snupe
Mane, I came a long way
Fo real
Yea!
You niggas rappin bout that shit
Nigga we outchea livin it nigga
This shit real nigga

[Verse 1: Lil Snupe]
Man I remember being in my cell, getting awaken by niggas fightin
Stressed out in this bitch cause ain't nobody writing
And I done rumbled in this bitch so many times I feel like Tyson
Remember getting released back when my niggas were united
Ballin in the mix, prolly ballin with yo bitch
Felt kinda good just to be ballin with my clique
And now the world know bout Lil Snupe and the shit I had to do
Man I had to get my shit straight, press up out a mixtape
I can never change, always remain the same
So much pain, I can't even write it, spit it from the brain
This shit is insane, finally in the game
But pussy niggas wanna be with me just to get some fame
Finna get the millions, stack it to the ceiling
Niggas know I'm bout it and I'm ready and I'm willin
If it's in the street, you niggas know I'm finna kill it
Went from juvenile life to this shit, this I'm feelin

[Hook: Lil Snupe]
I'll neva change, I'm a always keep it G
Livin out my dream, guess this shit was meant to be
I'll neva change, I'm a always keep it G
Livin out my dream, guess this shit was meant to be
I'll neva change, I'm a always keep it G
I'm livin out my dream, guess this shit was meant to be

Livin out my dream, guess this shit was meant to be

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
No lights mama crying mane this shit was meant to be
Money ain't change a thing mane this shit was meant for me
Plenty years many tears couldn't find a remedy too busy
Clutching on a nine trying to blind a enemy couple hits
Flew to Tennessee blowed up instantly gave back to the
City same niggas trying to finish me picture me rolling
Being stolen in penitentiary same mug same thug when
Them crackers finished me wait so much of hate but they
Couldn't stop me turnt a simple into a quarter into a nine
Piece turnt the clique house to a mansion this is real talk
In my living romm same niggas was in my clique house had
A talk with god he say imma out ya on boy he know im gon
Ride for him like I do my homeboy neva change right or wrong boy
I'm the truth long live Lil Snupe on the track with Boosie Boo nigga

[Hook: Lil Snupe]

Livin out my dream, guess this shit was meant to be
I'll neva change, I'm a always keep it G
Livin out my dream, guess this shit was meant to be
I'll neva change, I'm a always keep it G
I'm livin out my dream, guess this shit was meant to be
Mane I'll neva change, I'm a always keep it G
Livin out my dream, guess this shit was meant to be

[Verse 3: Lil Snupe]
I remember jammin Boosie in the morning, tryin to find out what to do
Now my niggas get up in the morning, they be jamming Snupe
I done seen so many niggas fall victim in my crew
Turn pussy, get on the stash, testify about the truth
Knowing that ain't how we came up
Bitch that ain't how these OG niggas trained us
Can't even look you in yo eyes, you like changed up
Peso called my fuckin phone, I had to hang up - That nigga a stranger
Got my dawg C4 fifthteen yea that hurt a nigga
You a square, you can never be in my circle nigga
All fuckin rat, I look at you like a gerbal nigga
You and Lil Chase on tight but we change yo verses nigga
Tell me how the fuck can you snitch on yo brother?
Get him 15 long years gone from his mother
Man you fuck me up, you got me feeling like no other
Cause we both from the gutter but now nigga is fucked

[Hook: Lil Snupe]
I'll neva change, I'm a always keep it G
Livin out my dream, guess this shit was meant to be
I'll neva change, I'm a always keep it G
Livin out my dream, guess this shit was meant to be
I'll neva change, I'm a always keep it G
I'm livin out my dream, guess this shit was meant to be
Mane I'll neva change, I'm a always keep it G
Livin out my dream, guess this shit was meant to be
