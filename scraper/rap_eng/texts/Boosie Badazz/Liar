[Hook]
Liar, liar, pants on fire
Hope the devil burn your ass
Liar, liar, pants on fire
Hope the devil burn your ass

Why did you lie?
This is my heart
It don't supposed to cry
Thought you were my boy
Girl, why did you lie?
This is my heart
It don't supposed to cry
Girl, why did you lie?

You gave me your word
You said you wouldn’t change
Now we facing murder
Now you tellin’ my name
I’m in so much pain
You stay by my Mama
I ate at yo house
We shared our lil ratchets
I slept on yo couch
Now you sellin’ out
I’m hurt up inside
I’m hurt cuz you lied
I’m so hurt
I’m tired
You jive
Can’t even look up in my eyes
Girl
I thought it was love
You told me you loved me
It must’ve been drugs
Cuz you did me so ugly
You treat me like nuthin
Pokey on tha stand like a bitch now
Pointin’ out tha whole fuckin’ click huh
Told Trudy White bout tha click huh
Even Lo turned sour
He done switched now
Some niggas ain’t sendin’ niggas shit huh
All tha girls left when I went down
Scared my first love
She done flipped now
I called on tha phone like

[HOOK]
Why did you lie?

Liar, liar, pants on fire
Hope the devil burn your ass
Liar, liar, pants on fire

[VERSE 2]
I got on my knees
I went, talked to GOD
I asked for forgiveness
For all of my boys
And all of these broads
Who went wit’ they move
Who said they was goons
First 48
When they up in tha room
They crack in the room
We used to be homies
I’m talkin bout ?
Got his hands in my Fun Yuns
We used to be cousins
Now we are nothing
Tell me what’s wrong
I feel like I’m preaching
Question
Why do they bite tha hand that feed em
How good you treat em
He said, she said
It was all lies
My heart got hurt to a loud cry
You a lie if you say I ain’t bout mine
I’m tha only one rolled when my dawg died
She said she was gon’ wait for a long time
She said she was gon’ keep tha pussy all mine
Lil’ freaky muthafucka
When I see you muthafucka
Ima tell ya
Girl!

Liar, liar, pants on fire
