[Intro]
Ooh
Kinda cold in them hideaways
Ain't nobody die today

[Chorus]
Savage holiday
Ooh, it's kinda cold in them hideaways
Ain't nobody die today
Savage holiday

[Verse 1]
Too young, died from the corner store (Ha)
Nigga brought that 'cause he wanted more (Ha)
Now they want get back, left us, gon' hit back
Left them boys in front the store (Ha)
Caught 'em in traffic, did the boy nasty
On some true dog shit
Sprayed everybody like, "Fuck it!"
On some Duval shit (Duval)
This 'fore Thanksgivin', they trippin'
They want blood, not chicken
Only thing on they mental
Kill that nigga 'fore Christmas
Miss Patty just lost her baby last Christmas
(Guess what else, though?)
Her other son, he got eighty last Christmas

[Chorus]
Savage holiday (Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya)
Ooh, it's kinda cold in them hideaways (Kinda cold in them hideaways)
Ain't nobody die today
I hope you safe and you escape a
Savage holiday (Savage holiday)
When you lose someone you love who you know love Christmas
Savage holiday
When that little thug first get that pistol, savage holiday

[Verse 2]
Baby mama trippin', men can't see they baby
And it's Christmastime (Oh Lord)
That's enough to drive you crazy
At Christmastime (Oh Lord)
Her nigga fucked her best friend 'round Christmastime
Now she don't even like that holiday no more, savage
This for Chicago, niggas who get it up like Ralo
This for my niggas in the snow in Milwaukee
New Year's, looked at the news, two kids
Another mother with a fuckin' savage holiday
No gift gon' make us proud today
Tell me 'bout it
Her other son, he gon' ride today (Ooh)
This happened all
He was finally fuckin' shinin', mayne
Like nigga, he was bossin'
Last year he was rappin'
This year he in a coffin
No merry Christmas

[Outro]
Savage holiday
Ooh, I hope you strapped up in them hideaways
Ooh, kinda cold in them hideaways
No merry Christmas, savage holiday
