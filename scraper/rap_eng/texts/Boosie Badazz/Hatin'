[Verse 1: Lil' Boosie]
Nigga ate at my momma table my daughter called him uncle (she called him uncle)
I treated him like he was Donkey and he told on me (he ratted on me)
The judge lookin' like he wanna drop a load on me
My nigga lookin' like he wanna break the code on me
Tell me why they let me ride for a year
Now they want my 745 until I show for this here
Nigga try to sneak me but that's ho shit (that's ho shit)
You ain't gon' get no stripes off me lil daddy (uh-uh)
You better try some more shit
And now they fuckin' with my girl head
Them hoes she 'round keep puttin' her soulja down
And she can't focus now
Ain't that a shame how they fuck up your name
Tell promoters you gon' cut throat 'em
Now you missin' your change
Who gon' take the pistol charge since everybody convicted
Been to 5 funerals in 3 months lord knows that I miss 'em
I guess when I get old and grey and my mission is done
You pussy motherfuckers y'all gon' hate on my son

[Verse 2: Lil' Boosie]
From the cradle to the grave I'm gon' always be a hustler
As long as you succeed they gon' always be a busta (huh bra)
They hated Dr. King (say that)
They hated when he marched (yeah)
They hated Malcolm X (fasho)
And they hated Rosa Parks (for real)
Sometimes the enemy on your passenger side
Ridin' witcha gettin' high
But you can't believe it
But you know that he sneaky (he sneaky)
When I was five my momma looked at her son
And told me "Boy you gon' break hearts cause you too cute for just one"
I guess this baby face and these rap skills that God blessed me with
Got niggas nuts hangin' ready to come and test me bitch but look
You know they said I was dead two shots up in my head
Some say I O-D'd off that Ex what they gon' say next

[Hook]
Tell my why they hatin' (why they hatin')
Hatin' on me (why they hatin' on me)
Cause I'm tryna get this paper (tryna get this paper)

It's real life homie

[Verse 3: Lil' Boosie]
Now they say me and Webbie beef and we on the same team (same team)
We drop hits you know your bitch we got the same dreams (same dreams)
Alot of niggas playa hatin' cause they ain't me (they ain't me)
So in they mind they won't hesitate to spank me
I seen alot of shit, Lord knows I try
Rumors hurt me inside but I'm still showin' pride
Want figgas like Jigga (yeah)
With a brain like Dane
Can't slip like beans
Cause I got dreams to be the mayne
But I never change
Mayne no matter how raw it get
I'm beast mode lil daddy so I'm prepared for the rawest shit
They called me out my name (believe that)
They told me I was stuntin'
Told 'em "One day bitch I'mma have some Oprah money"
