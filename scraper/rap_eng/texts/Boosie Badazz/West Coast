[Intro:]
Bad ass nigga
They love me, they love me, can't help it, they love me, they love me

[Chorus:]

They love me on the west coast
They love me on the west coast
They love me on the west coast
Best Smoke
Man they love me on the west coast

[verse 1:]

Up in Oakland, I be smokin'
Im a hood superstar, im the coldest
Got a lot of bad chicks, lot of Trojans
Me and Snoop in the lab getting loaded
All the girls say they love how i talk so i talk how i talk
Im a motha fuckin boss
Catch me coming i dont [?]
To the hood where its good, YG 400
Big love in L.A now
In santa ana man im bigger then a space ship
Got them niggas with them chucks on turnt up
Got the bait on lock, Steph Curry man
In the west i got the streets down
Got the Crips and the Bloods on speed dial
Got my CD on replay
I just talked to Kendrick Lamar dawg and geuss what he say

[Chorus:]

They love me on the west coast (love me on the west coast)
They love me on the west coast (love me on the west coast)
They love me on the west coast
Best Smoke (best smoke)
On the west coast

They love me on the west coast (bad ass nigga)
They love me on the west coast
Nigga really fuck with me on the west coast?
(bad chicks) They love me on the west coast

[Verse 2:]

I do my thing on the west coast
As a child, i always wished i had fame on the west coast
Blood, Blood, rock with game on the west coast
Crip, Crip, Rock with Nip on the west coast
Best smoke, hurt ya chest ya dig
This for my G's and my Mexicans
San Diego where they bump the kid
Mr.[?] man they love you boy
On the 405 free way
Got a call, it was rick, that nigga freeway
He told me meet by his spot he got a freeplay
He say the song "me and mustard[?] is on reply"
Reply, this one for the DJ
Who keep me bumping up in cali like EA
If the cops get straight then we all in
If the fox hit em all then the girls scream
And they love me in Seattle, Washington, Las Vegas too
And Alaska too. They bang Boosie Boo

[Chorus:]

They love me on the west coast (love me on the west coast)
They love me on the west coast (love me on the west coast)
They love me on the west coast
Best Smoke (best smoke)
On the west coast

They love me on the west coast (bad ass nigga)
They love me on the west coast
Nigga really fuck with me on the west coast?
(bad chicks) They love me on the west coast

[verse 3:]
Fuck with breezy, fuck with tyga
Got the reefer, got the lighter
Got the chicken and waffles and the sunset
Got a bad cali bitch watching the sunset
Hear my nigga J-Rock on the I6
He like "swang by the hood so we can talk shit"
Old schools comin through bumpin Boosie
Frisco man they fucking with that Boosie
Sacramento man the fucking with the kid
Every city, every ghetto that i go to they know Boo
I been looking for a tender on the west coast
Boss bitch Kris Jenner on the west coast'
Being toxic, toxic, loaded
Tripping me and Deshawn Jackson talking sporty
Cali girl on my side, and she the coldest
And her and all her girls told me

[Chorus:]
They love me on the west coast
They love me on the west coast (nigga what)
Nigga really fuck with me on the west coast?
(Compton nigga) they love me on the west coast

[Outro:]

Phoenix fucking with a nigga gosh dam,aw yeah
Even salt lake city fucking with a nigga
Badass nigga
