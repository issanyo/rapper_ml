(Lil Boosie)
Walk across that dirty track
At two o'clock a.m. flat
Strapped, snatched a dirty gat
Anything move, then murder that
Tired of go'n through pressure man
Cause of that lesson man
That shit hit a special vain, make you wanna test tha caine
I mean if it ain't that dozer or that weed man
It's somethin this solja boy don't need
Cause that caine gone shake yo breed, think I'm lyin keep try'n me
Ain't shit fo free you should know that
Got these bitches takin pictures that's why they call me Kodak
South side where that dro at, you know that's in my blood peeps
Can't keep a vision cause I'm itchin from tha flees and tha flood
Hollern "Slow Yo Roll"
Fuck tha half I want tha whole
Want some change fast and swole, so I won't ask no more
Cock it back and blast at hoes, feelin like a mad man
Try'n slang some yay up in this spot that's a bad plan
(There go them people) Thinkin bout what dad sayin
"Keep it real and keep tha steal
Take yo time and teach tha lil, fuck how yo people feel"
Got me thinkin dumb ways, got two pumps and two K's
Two licks in two days, for two fitted and new J's
I'm thugged out

[Hook]
Don't forget it, it's wicked
Roll wit Loc so I'm sick wit it
Follow me I got tha ticket
And some funk to go wit it

(Lil Boosie)
Real niggas be bout that torchin
I'll burn ya if you play wit me
Niggas be try'n to hate on me
That's why I keep my K wit me
Whoever, whenever it makes no differences who you be
Boy you bleed just like me, but I raised a Lil BG
Bottom boy, automatic anything that cause that static
If you beef wit us run out like a solja, you gone sleep wit us
A donkey boy, leave you funky boy
Smoked up everything from a lawyer to a junkie boy (it don't matter)
Niggas hollern bout that bout it, niggas likely to snitch
Niggas wanna see me dead cause my ho tight as a bitch
Don't run behind me, when ya find me
You gone regret you missed me
Cause my nerves then got pissed
And all you gone hear is this (BLUCKA!)
Cross tha track, I'm throwed off wit solja Reebok tennis
Thug shit I been in it, label Boosie a mensis
God please forgive my sins, but niggas try'n take my ends
So I'm pollutin and bootin, fuck tha talkin I'm shootin
Where yo nigga, yo round, you fuckin wodie, yo convent
I'm staight down to bomb quick, it's south side red rum shit
Boy then played everything man from (?) to dope fiends
Hit tha track in my Balances, stashin coke in tha alley

[Hook]
