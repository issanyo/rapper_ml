[Intro: Big Pokey Bear]
Ooh, my baby
Yeah
The devil made me do it

[Chorus: Big Pokey Bear]
I got the devil in my bedroom
She won't let me sleep (Won't let me sleep)
Oh no no no, won't let me sleep (Won't let me sleep)
Oh no no no, won't let me sleep (Won't let me sleep)
I got the devil in my bedroom
She won't let me sleep (Won't let me sleep)
Oh no no no, won't let me sleep (Won't let me sleep)
Oh no, won't let me sleep (Won't let me sleep)

[Verse 1: Boosie Badazz & Big Pokey Bear]
I was born up in South Baton Rouge (South side)
Where that devil rides your back (Rides your back)
Daddy cookin' coke in the kitchen (Oh no)
And he hit the needle right after that (Right after that)
Gun shots, pillow talkin' to me
My mama scared, what happened? (Scared, scared)
Mom in the back room arguin' with daddy
'Bout a bitch in his Cadillac, huh

[Chorus: Big Pokey Bear]
I got the devil in my bedroom
She won't let me sleep (Won't let me sleep)
Oh no no no, won't let me sleep (Won't let me sleep)
Oh no no no, won't let me sleep (Won't let me sleep)
I got the devil in my bedroom
She won't let me sleep (Won't let me sleep)
Oh no no no, won't let me sleep (Won't let me sleep)
Oh no, won't let me sleep (Won't let me sleep)

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz & Big Pokey Bear]
My baby mama say she want more money (Oh, here we go again)
I wanna run Forrest, run (I just wanna run)
I go to sleep, my dreams be ugly (My dreams be ugly)
For all the sins that I done done (For all the sins I done)
On death row, they said I wouldn't make it (They said it was over)
They slandered my name and the pain (Slandered my name)
They made my mama the witness (No, no, no)
So she couldn't be in trial with her baby

[Chorus: Big Pokey Bear]
I got the devil in my bedroom
She won't let me sleep (Won't let me sleep)
Oh no no no, won't let me sleep (Won't let me sleep)
Oh no no no, won't let me sleep (Won't let me sleep)
I got the devil in my bedroom
She won't let me sleep (Won't let me sleep)
Oh no no no, won't let me sleep (Won't let me sleep)
Oh no, won't let me sleep (Won't let me sleep)

[Bridge: Boosie Badazz]
It's a cold, dirty world
It's a cold, dirty world
It's a cold, dirty world
It's a cold, dirty world
You said I'd be comin' home
You was wrong, dirty devil
I had cancer in my body
Get off me, dirty devil
I was on death row and I ain't go

[Outro]
I was on death row and I ain't go
I was on the dirty dirty devil, I was on the dirty dirty devil
We gon' electrocute your ass, boy
We gonna give your ass life, boy
That's the rapper, haha
I knew then when I looked at 'em, I said, "I know what you is, the devil"
They put shackles tight on my hands, yeah
Racist jealous motherfucker, yeah
Mad 'cause I'm livin' good, the devil
Listen to my chains beat
Trippin' in this motherfucker
Know what you is, the devil
