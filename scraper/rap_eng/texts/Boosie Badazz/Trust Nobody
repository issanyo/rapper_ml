[Intro]
Trust nobody
Don’t trust your friend
Don’t trust your sister
Don’t trust your brother
Don’t even trust your mama
Or your father
Or your grandmother
Or your grandfather
Trust nobody
Don’t trust your girl or your girl’s girl friend
Period

[Verse 1]
Indicted by closest friends (indicted by closest friends)
Stole from mane by my closest kin
Real G’s like me, we supposed to win
'Posed to have real G’s not supposed to friends
Damn lil’ mama look at you with them pretty eyes
Left me when I went to prison
Thought you was a little bigger
But you just like a nigga
Couldn’t supply you what ya need so you leave me like a killer
I said fuck a lot of niggas, now them niggas can’t stand me
Love the shit out of 'em but I can’t trust my own family
I need to go solo dolo to Miami
I bet if I was broke half these niggas couldn’t stand me
Eyes on everybody, I don’t trust a soul
The real ones ain’t real no more, so I don’t trust the code
Don’t think my bitch silent just ‘cause the dick good (it’s true)
Your family'll steal from ya 'fore ya bitch would

[Hook with Z-Ro]
I trust nobody (I don’t trust family, I don’t trust friends
I don’t trust nobody)
I trust nobody (God said you put your faith in man he will fail you every time)
I might love somebody (You can love somebody but never trust them 100%, they will turn)
But I don’t trust nobody (The only person I trust is God, trust no one, like 2Pac he said)
He said trust nobody

[Verse 2]
I seen my homeboy do me kinda wrong
That’s why you never hear Lil Junior in a song
Whoever thought his spot'll be gone
Old boy used to be my dude now he blues
Whoever thought his top'll be gone
Bad part I kept it G with homie
12 years still my bitch, played the people on me (mane)
Real tears in the cell by my lonely
Pen and paper envelopes, the Ruger real my homies
We fighting bodies ‘cause our homies
Had to realize niggas ain’t loyal
And all smiles ain’t from the heart
Man these niggas ain’t calling
Bitch nigga Pokey turned rat at like 40
Ain't wanna see me on the streets so he took half a forty (took 20 years)
I’m like damn who next to switch gangster on me
Who next going downtown and lie that they ain't own it
Nigga, your picture wasn’t perfect and it’s painted on
You ain’t nothing like me and Donk

[Hook]
I trust nobody (I don’t trust family, I don’t trust friends
I don’t trust nobody)
I trust nobody (God said you put your faith in man he will fail you every time)
I might love somebody (You can love somebody but never trust them 100%, they will turn)
But I don’t trust nobody (The only person I trust is God, trust no one, like 2Pac he said)
He said trust nobody

[Outro]
Used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Scream ride or die, thought you would die with me
Found out you a bitch, you can’t even ride with me
Now it’s a war, you ain’t on the side with me
Nigga used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Scream ride or die, thought you would die with me
Now it’s a war, you ain’t on the side with me
You ain’t my brother, nigga
