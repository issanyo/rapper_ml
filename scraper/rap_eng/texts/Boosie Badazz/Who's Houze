[Verse 1:]
Strolling through my hood
On my way to Atlantic
Thirty days from the grammys
Twenty five blocks from a grand understand
And I can feel it in the air but a nigga won’t panic
That’s when I got stop by the Head Park Cops
You sign with Boo now is you we rock
When the time comes we gonna take that shot
Put your hands on your head when the mixtape drop
We sended by, couple tapes for the crew
Where’s the dough, from the states we grew
Not the first pick try to touch my crew
Either do what you do
Or let the nigga slide through
At the top I got my interviews
Off the clock, I feel bad for you dude
40 K  years and your kids need food
And a nigga like me got a neck full of jewels
So off the street I walk
I think about God and I believe he talks
I don’t wanna show off with the things I bought
It’s the dreams that cost, what you mean your boss
Looked up like yay, I made it to Time Square
The waves rock me here
Got the air with (unable to hear clearly the words in this line)

[Chorus] [x2]
I learn the game at whose house
Whose house
Bitch I’m decked out in jewels house
New songs
Nigga my whole crews out
And you can move now

[Verse 2:]
Gotta see if the fraternity match
Boss nigga and my salary cap
But leave a drop, a leave the chatter a rat
As a matter of fact
Let’s not talk about the shit, I think it’s better we act
If I shoot 4, 5 niggas better react
Ain’t nobody telling shit
We took a veteran pack
Very scary when I carried the axe
Ain’t a nigga attacks
How the shit going, fucking with that
I speak cool, but i’m heavily strapped
I get high off the deadliest raps
You gotta move when the felony strap
Street shit, but intelligent rap
I’m ahead of the curve, I’ll be ducking the swerve
Let no man take nothing that’s yours
Murder charge another subject or verbs
You gotta do it if you’re out of the words
And I’m out of the words
None of mine for a dozen of your’s
You running blind, then you loving the serve
Won’t grind but you swear you deserve
You eating swine with the men that we serve
I killed the game like boo nigga
I got the fame of a new nigga
I set self for the mascot and tell
Digital cd’s on shelves
Dropping my LP at twelve
Giving them hell
Like Gucci and Savage and Shell, well (laughters)
Bad ass music
Where stars are made
Beware, beware
A star is made
More music more money
More money, more motivation
Like I told you
Only you can stop yourself from being break
And even though it’s a difference
We want finally rich
Bitches will last forever, cause this lifestyle we first proud
And music is everything
Like all them coke use to have on the street, It’s everything
I learnt the game at whose house
