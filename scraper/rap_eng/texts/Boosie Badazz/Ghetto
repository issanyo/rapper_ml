[Hook]
Not a nigga out the ghetto
Tryna make it out the ghetto
I got love for my ghetto
Shout out to my ghetto
It all started in the ghetto

[Verse 1]
Not a nigga out the ghetto
Straight off the corner
Thug rules and thug school boy
I walked out on ya
Save yo whole corner, ghetto remedies
Another ghetto nigga up in jail when they sentence me
Preach I got enemies
Deep but they scared of me
Ghetto ass nigga with a rap gift god blessing me
[?] taught you mad video games
My uncles caught me [?] real cocaine
If gods is in vein
We all get slain
We come to them Glocks
Some making the music
Some hustle the block
Some take what you got
Run in you ho-house gotta feed the happy
Message to every nigga in the ghetto

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Get to my ghetto, South Baton Rouge
When niggas love me I'm the realest with a thousand goons

Boss man got major rank
Me and Lil Bleek hitting jack town set about 80 pounds
Been on that rail road

Lots of real niggas
Rick got them soldiers  (ask Kurby)
Late night, Halloween, real [?]
Niggas love the ghetto cuz the block always hiring
White sheets, sirens, the ambulance they late though
The bitches took they time when the [?]

Rolex watches we got stacks
Another ghetto rich nigga from across the tracks
