[Intro]
This goes to that motherfucker who just maced my niece
Them motherfuckers who just took a million dollars worth of jewelry from me
It's on now, motherfucker
It's all on now, motherfucker

[Verse 1]
Dear police, are you afraid? (Are you afraid?)
What have you been taught at that academy to be afraid? (Scared ass bitch)
Why you don shoot at the hand, thigh or the leg(tell me that)
Why you get shoot for the blacks, chasin' they head (you call police)
What if your job got shot down for no reason? (What if that your job?)
He had no gun, hands up, shot for no reason (you dirty bitch)
They charge him, said they gon' convict him, I don't believe (I don't believe)
Protect and serve, they don't do it, so we don't need 'em

[Chorus]
You pussy bitches, pigs in trainin'
You bitches dangerous, look in the mirror, y'all the fucking gangsters
You pussy bitches, I hope you rot in hell
Hope you get fucked in that cell, motherfucker
You pussy bitches, look how they do us niggas
They wanna act like we wrong, when we shoot them bitches
Without that badge, you a bitch in a hat
You pussy ass nigga with a gun
Fuck your pussy ass, fuck your captain too
You need a headshot, bitch, for your sons

[Verse 2]
They the biggest gang in the world
They do the coldest things in the world
They ask me how I feel 'bout the cops gettin' shot
Eye for eye, tooth for tooth
You don't give a motherfuck what they do to you
If they can line 'em all up, they'll shoot the crew
Like the tosser cops, she a crazy bitch
Inmates listen up, please do me a favor, rape the bitch
I'm at the point where I hate this shit
I'm at the point where I can't take this shit no more, nigga
If anybody on the news tryna take off for 'em
I ain't watchin' your show, you a hoe, nigga
Baton Rouge, Baltimore, [?]
It's goin' brazy, bitch down, get retarded
We gotta show 'em that black lives matter
It's no love for the chief in the casket

[Chorus]
Pussy bitches, you know that you wrong
You shoot for no reason, you come in our homes, they don't wanna leave us alone
Pussy bitches, you committin' these murders
You scared and you nervous, your purpose is murder
You pussy bitches, I hate you with all of my heart
I hate how you look in 'em suits, I hate how you walk in 'em boots
I hate your whole family, bitch, you ain't no grown man, you a bitch
I hope that your daughter, she suckin', the blackest of blackest of dicks

[Verse 3]
Bitches got me mad and I'm turnt up
They do it in your city, fuckin' burn it up
Don't stop, man, run, better get the fuck
Like Tip say, man, it's either them or us
Tell me this, why you shoot that man?
Wake up, it's the Klu Klux Klan
They just took the white shit off they head
And put another color suit on instead
They kill two of us niggas every week
Leave us dead, stinkin' in the street
Say we was a threat to they ass
But they lyin' 'cause it's on TV
And the rules that they got for the law
When them bitches go to court, they gon' walk
If the police every ask you a question
Don't talk, they the enemy

[Chorus]
Pussy bitches, I hope that you die
I hope you get put in the alligator pit and eaten alive
Pussy bitches, I hope you don't sleep
I'm fuckin' your daughters real hard in they asshole, I'm the police
