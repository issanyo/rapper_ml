[Intro]
I promise to protect and serve my family
And the ones I love
By all means
That’s my call of duty

[Verse 1: Boosie Badazz]
Woke up, family calling my line
Real shit, ‘cause family calling me crying
‘Bout lil shit, like bills and dollar signs
Fuck around and say that I ain’t got it, they say I’m lying
Plus I got to take care of my momma
Got to take care of my daughter, and be a father
One of my baby mamas calling off, want me to fix the picture
Go do for mine, not you, you got a whole nigga
Aunty need, my cousin need, bought all my nieces' cars
Blessings coming equal for me, all the people love me
No more asking for hundreds, it’s thousands, they know I’m getting money
But I ain’t Sean John yet, I’m a young Puffy
Wit a call of duty though, wit kids so beautiful
Soon as I say no, they gon’ holler I ain’t real no more
I’m from a family of hustlers, players, and fiends
Now I see what comes along with this dream
Serving my call of duty

[Hook: Boosie Badazz]
Promise help to my mama, mama, mama, my my lil sister
Nigga, that’s just my call of duty
Time to be a daddy now, daddy now
Serving my call of duty, serving my call of duty
(I promise to protect and serve my family)
Serving my call of duty, serving my call of duty
(By all means, it’s my call of duty)

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Granny told me with a lot of money comes a long line
Sometimes, I get so tired, think everybody’s lying
But I stand up like a real nigga, barely say No I’m a ill nigga
Boss just left the jeweler, whole clique shine like a flicker flicker
Family worrying me, PO keep fucking with me
Shouldn’t have got caught with that shit, but I need that burner on me
If I keep saying oh nanana, you’re gon’ start turning on me
Now it’s my call of duty to burn your ass, permanently
‘Cause my niggas in the grave’s kids call me Daddy, too
Got a call of duty to try my best to fill their daddy’s shoes
So many niggas ungrateful, the real nigga blues
So many nights, I feel used, on my call of duty
Hustler, blessed to be given this assignment, really
Rather have this call of duty than a [?]
My dog need a nigga, he halfway through his bid
Sent my momma with a money bag to his kids
Nigga, that just my call of duty

[Hook]

[Outro]
Call of duty
Being a real nigga making real nigga music
That’s just my call of duty
The streets need me, they call Boosie
No pressure, my nigga
That’s just my call of duty
Yeah
Yeah
That’s just my call of duty, nigga
Boosie Badazz
