Straight up

[Verse 1]
Man, you niggas ain’t
Shinin’ right
Y’all just talkin’
Y’all just talkin’
Your grill ain’t doin’ the Japanese, my friend
You ain’t Sanchie
(Nah, nigga)
You talk and hit us, my nigga
But we’re your donkey
In other countries
We then put them fuckin’ diamonds there
On monkeys
Haha
Well what you talkin’ ‘bout
You know I come from Johnny
On Facetime with Sky
The other line
I got Mezzani
Oooh
I’m real and
I’m never gonna change
(And I’m never gonna change)
I’m real and
I’m stayin’ the same
(Fuck this)
Look at the bezel and chain
I deserve every chain

[Verse 2]
Real nigga
Big gold chain with the big block
(The big block)
Run up in the club
With the stick high
(Stick high)
Get in my way at the tip top
Got a real chop like Sauce Walk

[Verse 3]
I remember it was all a dream
A dream
Got me pickin’ wings
All we could afford is choppers
But we wanted bigger things
Down in South Park
Or Martin Luther King
Where the youngers sling dope
By the swings
They tryn’a be kings
The only way to do it is the queen
I’m so proud to be successful
‘Cause my momma was a fiend
(My momma)
Whoever thought that I’d be pimpin’ hoes
And sellin’ music?
(Whoever)
I grew up around bandanas and AK’s shootin’
Still remember the first day
The twins met LaBoucie
(Boucie)
I had a [?] that my bitch bought from James Bond movie
(I’m a [?])
Feelin’ debonair
Spinnin’ flavor everywhere
Before a nigga take my chain
I’ll see the electric chair
Bought my ice from King Johnny
Trophies of my dedication
Now they gotta watch these texters
Dialers all across the nation
I’m the reason why your wife
Parked outside my house
(I am)
I’m the reason you missin’
A couple a thousand outside your account
‘Cause she paid the kid
[?] the bitch
You was beside her
But I really made the bitch
See I was a favorite
You cannot change the shit
You cannot change a thing
Hopin’ you change a name
Hope is a really good game
Look at me change
Takin’ me outta your brain

[Hook]
To park it
I’ll roll the back wood and spark it
(I make these other niggas park it)
Spark it
Park it (park it)
Park it lik bih (park it)

Far from a rookie
Hey, man, it’s cool

‘Cause you did what I’m sayin’?
