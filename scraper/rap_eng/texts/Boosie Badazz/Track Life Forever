[Intro]
Merry Christmas nigga, hah
This for the hood right here, baby
Straight up
Yeah
Free Wild Thing, nigga, yeah
(Ant life forever, ever)
God Pierce Street, nigga, Roosevelt
(Track life forever, ever)
This the project I bang, look

[Verse 1]
I drive to school with a Taurus-9 (Stop playin'), bitch, I'm out here
They play me, they blind you
Somebody find you, my niggas out here (We out here)
Sell my dope in the back of the projects, nigga, that's Boosie spot
Then I went by my Granny on Garfield, by Moolah house
Where they keep them toolies out
Track life, fear nobody, track life
Get your money, track life
Catch you a body, track life
It's 'bout money, we with it
We can't get it, we steal it
Rob that nigga, cut him down
This for Dunk and D-Picture

[Chorus]
Track life forever, ever (What?)
(Roosevelt Street Project is the project I bang)
Ant life forever, ever (Ten or four, nigga)
(Untamed, close range, they gon' die on my name)

[Verse 2]
Strapped with that thirty, that boy was dirty (Dirty)
(What I did?), yeah, that boy was 30
No, that wasn't curvin' (No)
No, we ain't worried (No)
'Cause we love swingin' on niggas
Track life forever and ever and ever (And ever)
Rest in peace Lil Bleek
Got your face up on my chain, wrote your name in the street
Free the gang, Deebo Billy, and my cousin Lil G
I'll up on one of you bitches like G (Free G)

[Chorus]
Track life forever, ever (Free Tony Sneed)
(Roosevelt Street Project is the project I bang)
Ant life forever, ever (I'm out the bottom but I'm finna pull up the trenches, nigga
It's a lil' bloody in here)

[Outro]
Me and Ruger in the bushes, ho, you push us, it's a bloodbath (Me and Ruger)
Me and Ruger in the bushes, ho, you push us, it's a bloodbath (Me and Ruger)
(Four shit, no ho shit)
That life forever, ever
(Roosevelt Street Project is the project I bang
Untamed, close range, they gon' die on my name)
