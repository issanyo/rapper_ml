[Hook:K.T.]

Stacks in my pocket,got the heater on deck
Cruisin through my city ain worried bout shit
Cuz im just ridin in my camaro, blowin on that mojo

My hat to the front, got my seat laid back
Every block i hit i make the whole hood act
Cuz im just ridin in my camaro, blowin on that mojo



[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]

I wake up call my nigga blake roll me up a blunt
Jump in my camaro hit the hood and stunt
Hat to the front gat on my lap
Ain worried bout a thang
20 grand up in my pocket in my city im the mane
Everybody love that yellow thang wit the rims to match
Should've saw them niggas eyes when i jumped the fuckin track
Yellow polo im so fresh bigboi in that ss
Forty Glock in the vest no need to stress ain convicted
But my black ss the sickest real shit this ain no lie
Hustle hard and grind so i buy cars two at a time
Throwin twenties out the window to the kids on the block
Everybody see me take pictures and jock
Bad bitches follow me beggin to swallow me
Big money big crib big diamond watch up on the steering wheel
Police give me thumbs up at you like you cuttin up
My car could fuck her plus imma superstar bruh

Ghost behind me in that white thang grippin that forty tight mane
