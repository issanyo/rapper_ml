[Hook (3x)]
Southside superstar, fours on the trap car
Throw it up to your bitch and ask her what it sitting for

[Verse]
I told y’all this time around, it’s gonna be crazy, homie
I’m a southside superstar, everybody loving me
Visit my smile, I’m hot while I be on BET
Charger with the Hemi seats, Boosie got many freaks
And I’m the newest superstar in the industry
Money out the window, nothing but purple indo
Celebrity, man, but I keep it real with my kinfolk
Before I was a rapstar, Boosie was a trapstar
Way before the rap, feds had my phone tapped now
I’m everywhere from the backyard to the Awards, you can bet I’m there
Shining like a motherfucking chandelier
Little children can’t even talk, spelling my name
They be like B-O-O, I done fucked up the game

Southside superstar, fours on the trap car
Throw it up to your bitch and ask her what it sitting for
