When I was small
My mama told me (my mama told me)
Whatever you want to be (whatever you wanna be)
You can do it (you can do it boosie)
Aiight
I said aiight mama
I'mma do it

[Verse 1]
I send this out to everybody wit dreams
Who trynna chase they dreams by any means
You might wanna be a lawyer a doctor
Whatever
Do whatever you want
You can do it if you put yo mind to it
Talkin' rap stars trap stars
If you work hard
You can be the best at what you doing
That's a fact boy
I know you from the hood
Shit don't look good
But that don't mean you can't make it out
Be in a nice house
Keep ya head up
Never say you can't
Love yourself if you feel nobody loves you
You can be bigger then jigga
Have your own cologic
Money like Oprah Winfry and Raven Samone
You keep shooting that ball
You keep getting tall
You might be headed to the NBA any day
Gotta pray to god to guide you home
So hit yo knees
If you believe then you can achieve
Take the game from me

Since an itty bitty kitty
I've been chasn' my dreams
I dreamed this on my desk
Back in middle school (2x)
Since an itty bitty kitty
I've been chasn' my dreams
I'mma be all I can be by any means
Say that
Since an itty bitty kitty
I've been chasn' my dreams
I dreamed this on my desk
Back in middle school

[Verse 2]
Middle School (kill da world)
Boosie lets ride
High School (McKinley High)
Handful of rocks
17 years old I was the man on the block
Fat knots two at the bottom four at the top
18 I was ready (hustle)
19 ready
20 in a beamer living the movie belly
For real I ain't no wanna-be
Bitch I'm a gonna-be
Told my son you can be better then me if you wanna-be
Got ya mind made up and it can happen
I told the principle every time I got paddled
That one day I'll be rich wit alotta nice car
He told me shut up
You gone be behind bars
And you can be a star
And never ever quit
If he ain't doing nothing
He don't need to tell you shit
Say that
When I was 5 my mama
Looked at her son and
Told me boy you gone
Break hearts cause you to cute for just one
