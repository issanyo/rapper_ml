Tanktop, big rocks, big Glocks
I'm a get rich or die trying t make it to the top
Nigga, I'm a keep it gangsta, I'm a keep it gangsta
I'm a keep it gangsta, I'm a keep it gangsta
Life stories, real shit, real facts
Real niggas, real bitches, feel that
Nigga, I'm a keep it gangsta, I'm a keep it gangsta
I'm a keep it gangsta, I'm a keep it gangsta

[Verse]
I spit this shit from the bottom of my stomach
So try some I knock the bottom out ya stomach
It ain't nothing, momma like, "Ooh my baby boy thugging"
In love with guns and he can't stop clubbing, never could tell him nothing
Fuck with real G's with big nuts who flip keys on highways
Player-made niggas, man, who flip hoes off MySpace
Luxury in driveways, let your roof back, nigga
That half of pill ain't doing the job, then throw your two back, nigga
My time to shine, niggas playing, but I'm bout my business
Last to drop, but off the top, the whole world know I'm the sickest
Red Monkey's to Dickies, nigga got every color
From [?] to 28, niggas got many hustles
My brothers, they Trill Fam, love me because I'm loyal
Dude keep his shit strapped, because my watch will get me kidnapped
From my block to yo trap, iggas heads get bust
Feds get dust, my trill niggas out here ready to bust
It's gangsta

[Hook]
Tanktop, big rocks, big Glocks

Nigga, I'm a keep it gangsta, I'm a keep it gangsta
I'm a keep it gangsta, I'm a keep it gangsta
Life stories, real shit, real facts
Real niggas, real bitches, feel that
Nigga, I'm a keep it gangsta, I'm a keep it gangsta
I'm a keep it gangsta, I'm a keep it gangsta
