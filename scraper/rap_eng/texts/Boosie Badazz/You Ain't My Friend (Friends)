Frieeends...
How many of us have them... Oh yeah
Friends... How many of us have them... ohh uhh... ohh ohhh

(Chorus)x2
You ain't my wodie
You ain't my round
You ain't my Thug Nigga til da end...
What happened to da friends we coulda been
When I was down u ain't even come around(round)

[Quick]
Look, look
Tryna keep it guudda but friends got me on my numbas
Standin frontin and you ain't payin imma fuckin
Ya stupid motha fucka
Always thought that I was playin
Now I gotta cut ya loose and letcha roam on the land
It's time to be a grown man I caint hold ya hand
Look I had love for ya people I hope they understand
I did all I can
When you went to jail I
Bent over backwards for ya still ain't
I coulda fucked yo main bitch but I had love for ya
If ya got some gangsta shit Lil Quick was quick ta bust for ya
Kick up dust for ya even put on cuffs for ya
I hate to say it but now it's tough love for ya
I ain't gone let this money change me
You did it to ya self you ain't gotta explain ta me(explain ta me)
I'm tryna send this message to my ghetto people
Neva eva bite da hand that feed ya

(Chorus)x2
You ain't my wodie
You ain't my round
You ain't my Thug Nigga til da end...
What happened to da friends we coulda been
When I was down u ain't even come around(round)

(Boosie)
Say dawg look
You can't lie
I held it down through da thick and thin
If I fuck witchu I'm like chucky friends til da end
Ya meals at my house
When I think about what happened tears wanna come out
I've bent my back and been a hunded witcha
If ya had pussy problems I used ta run it witcha
Look what greed done a nigga
So many friends in da wind since da money came
Caint stand ta see me do my thang and that's a fuckin shame
I gave my last
The first time ya asked
Momma like this fuckin heart gone get me zipped up in a bodybag
Whateva happened to the real G(the real G)
Who do life in da pen 'fo they let they fuckin stripes bleed
We livin in da last days
New friends uhh uhh
Cuz badass been betrayed
So treat 'em like slaves Father God punish them
For punishin me
Had me thinkin ? ?

(Chorus)x2
You ain't my wodie
You ain't my round
You ain't my Thug Nigga til da end...
What happened to da friends we coulda been
When I was down u ain't even come around(round)
