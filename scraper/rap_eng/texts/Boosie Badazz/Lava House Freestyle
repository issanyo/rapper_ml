[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
I'm a Ratchet nigga, this off the head
I freestyle all day when I be thinking about my dad
Rochelle she in the back, and she looking at me
She know I savage it everytime, I'm good at it
And I'm a motherfucking thug and I love my city
I love them pretty titties
I love them sick-ass dickies, you know I'm thugged out
I got some throwbacks, some work up in the drug house
And Lava House, they got my back like they Minnie Mouse
You fuck with me, I'll go and get that choppa
I might go get Big Poppa
And he's going to heart-stop ya
I'm finna go off this bitch, cause I done flowed in this bitch
And hide your ho, cause she'll be down low, sucking my dick, bitch

[Verse 2: Big Poppa]
I catch the mic and bring it back
See niggas in my hood, sell powder, ecstasy, and sell crack, bitch
Well I'm Big Poppa, I don't give a damn
You fuck with me, a ho or a nigga get put in a fucking chokeslam, nigga
I'm out the bottom, out the 11 hundred, tatted up
Look at them niggas and the feds, man, they ratted up
Hating on some real niggas, hit the club and pop pills, nigga
Sit at the bar, flip out them hundred dollar bills, nigga
Now these player hating ass niggas, they wanna do me
They mad cause I did "Love Ya Hood" with Lil' Boosie
Ya'll niggas wanna trip, cause I let my pants sag
And I keep some fresh Reebok's, and I keep my black rag
And I gang bang for a living, dawg
You understand?
Fuck the judge, I go to court high, throw a "fuck you" sign on the stand
I do it how I do it
Ain't nothing to it
Pump your motherfucking brain with battery acid and embalming fluid

[Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
No tears today, nothing but kisses and hugs
For niggas and thugs, who missing from pistols and slugs
Saw his momma, and she spoke and put her head down
Made me shed a tear, and I want somebody dead now, rest in peace
I'mma ride for you, wodie
You know I'm thinking about you everytime we get loaded, but true thugs
They don't learn until they burn
That's just like me, but God ain't never gave my turn
Wicked ways off sherm, got me addicted to these streets
"Am I next in my casket?", is what I ask my peeps
So pray for me, how I'm gonna learn when this ghetto life was gave to me?
Why I do right when hollow tips on the chase for me?
How many times it done went in one ear out the other?
From your momma, your grandma, your auntie, and your brother
They try to tell you right, cause they know that you a hustla
They only tell you right, cause they love ya
