And On My Feet I Got Some Reeboks Straight From New Orleans

I Went To Exxon Got Filled Up I'm real buff, On Top Of That I'm Grilled Up
Hoes Hollin Out The Window, Boosie Pass Me That Indo
I Told Her Slow Down Lil Mama Look Cause We Ain't Kinfolk

And Mr Officer Mr Officer Would You Please Get These Dog Hoes Off Of Us

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

Look Here Lift Up That Shirt And Let Me See Somethin
Huh Bruh, She Lookin Like She Wanna Freak Somethin
I'm On The Yard Trien To Snatch Me A Nerd
Got They Eyes Like Smokey As I'm Turnin The Curb

Cause I Wear Mitchell & Ness And They Wear White Tees Get Ya Money Up
Thats Wat Make The Honeys Come If Ya Broke All The Time Man Ain't No Girls Gone Wanna Fuck

Girls Sendin Naked Pictures Of They Fuckin Behind
On my car I got blinds And I'm Thuggin Them Hoes

Hoes Pullin On A Nigga Like He Kobe Damn

[Chorus]
