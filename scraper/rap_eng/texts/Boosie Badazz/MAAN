[Intro]
Maan, they know they’re doing

[Verse 1]
They’re talking to 12
They go ‘round the corner, they pick up the phone, they run and they tell
They up on the net, they flashing their tecs
They saying their names, busting them things, robbing these niggas for all of their chains
Then they put their location where they hang, this the new game
But they shoot, man, just snatched my nigga shoe, man
All these youngsters want to be Blood, it used to be about the Blue gang
Murder weapon, they’ll get ya, that trophy shit
Go on IG and flash the same gun that they smoked them with, these niggas oversnitch
Shooting guns, recording it, snitch and being a lawyer
These 90s babies crazy, but 2000s a lil’ harder
Man they shoot the mall up, Foot Locker wet your girl up
Pick up the phone and call their girl up, and tell ‘em they did it

[Hook]
Maan, fuck
Man, these people fucked up
Maan, fuck, fuck
These people fucked up

[Verse 2]
I turn on the news, a mother in tears, a son is gone
I’m thinking ‘bout [?], I put on my shoes, I go check his room
‘Cause niggas his age ain’t screwed tight, niggas his age, they’re goon like
We just tryna live the good life, push a nigga shit back, good night
First 48 around this bitch, they telling on their own blood
My girl did it, telling on their own girl for the world
They got these psycho lil’ bitches, they think they’re Bonnie, man
They don’t need Clyde to do nothing but drive, these bitches gunning, man
Man, these hoes got more nuts than these niggas
Go to jail, they visit, will complete a mission
Unlike niggas, man, oh man, a iPhone is all they had
Hurt my heart ‘cause an 80s baby did that, got a nigga like “shit”

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
El Chapo back home, they raising prices
They killing our kids, man, I’m talking ISIS (they really don’t like us)
Got niggas on bids, man, [?]
My touch ain’t like Drizzy, nigga, my touch ain’t Midas, I strike lighters
I just keep that shit 100 and be stating the facts
Most of American gangsters was American rats
Your favorite trapper you bumping probably never done trapped
That hood he say he represent, he probably never been at
Have you like

[Hook]
