[Intro]
Peace seems so hard to find
Peace seems so hard to find

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna find some peace, but can't find an ounce
Just lost my auntie Keisha, monster got her, breast cancer
My nigga Dame on trial and they tryna flip him
Sanches fightin' the rope, they tryna kill him
Mike Brown shot down, they goin' to war about it
This happen everyday in my hood, they just don't talk about it
Plus a nigga on parole
One feet in the pen, one feet at the door
You know how that go
Parole tax a nigga, you don't like it get the fuck on
I don't like your bitch ass, nigga, you gettin' stepped on
Too many bitches callin' my line
People that I know they keep on dyin'

[Hook]
Roller coaster ride
Not many ups, too many downs
(Peace seems so hard to find)
Roller coaster ride
Not many ups, too many downs
(Peace seems so hard to find)

[Verse 2]
So many niggas gon' bitch made, switchin' up
Stay out my lane, pussy nigga, I'll hit you up
This world crazy, gotta show 'em what a man 'bout
Wake up, too many fuckin' people got their hand up
Try and do the right thing, what my P.O. tell me
But who I'm gon' hang 'round? All my niggas felons
Can't trust too many niggas snitchin', all these niggas tellin'
Do any hoes love me for me? All these bitches guessin'
Duckin' IRS, fuckin' girls who mess
Don't want me to have a gun, now you tryna wet me
So I go get 40 acres and a mule
Came home strong, multi on the cooch
Damn, people judgin' from the start
Always talk about crime, never talk about my heart
Who been about his business, true, fed the whole city, true
Same motherfuckers when you go to jail shit on you
Shit scary over here, I got a sicker crew
Anything got a dick in it when I spit at you, nigga
So I ain't even worry about you niggas
Now I don't give a fuck about you niggas

[Hook]
Roller coaster ride
Not many ups, too many downs
(Peace seems so hard to find)
