[Chorus: JayDaYoungan]
Somebody tell these pussy niggas I ain't playin'
You got a problem, I got answers
I sent a blessing, shooters come in while you layin'
Bitch we want all cancer, we come where you hangin'
Out the window, get to bangin', pussy bitch don't end up stankin'
Catch you slippin', we gon' slang it
And if you say my name, bitch it won't be no explainin'
All this fuck shit got me angry, leave you wet like if it rainin'

[Verse 1: JayDaYoungan]
Ride with my stick, in your section with the stress
No we ain't got no picks, step on you and who you with
Don't end up on my list, Glock burn like a pot of grease
I be thuggin' like a bitch, move over, you'll get hit
Yeah they know who the don is, just don't fuck with the Youngan
When we catch you ain't no runnin', bitch fuck you and how you comin'
And you say you get money but lil bitch I know you bummin'
All my diamonds they be jumpin', I'll be damned you take it from me
Pull up, one in the chamber, up this bitch and then I bang it
Want cancer, we gon' bring it
Don't fuck with me, that shit dangerous
Stop playin', what you thinkin'
Chop gon' step in and he anxious
To blow on this bitch lanky
Go to sleep, here go your blanket (pussy)

[Chorus: JayDaYoungan]
Somebody tell these pussy niggas I ain't playin'
You got a problem, I got answers
I sent a blessing, shooters come in while you layin'
Bitch we want all cancer, we come where you hangin'
Out the window, get to bangin', pussy bitch don't end up stankin'
Catch you slippin', we gon' slang it
And if you say my name, bitch it won't be no explainin'
All this fuck shit got me angry, leave you wet like if it rainin'

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
You got problems, I got answers, my thugs all cancer
Snatch you from the club, hold your bitch ass for ransom
Put it on them niggas when they come and bring the ransom
Can't do nothing with me, Allen Iverson, the answer
Somebody better tell that boy that we don't do the drive-by
Catch him while he parked, two piece him at the Popeye's
Daddy he wasn't home, so the streets raised a wise guy
Everything he dead, only half if he paralyzed
Bitch I swear ain't why I dirty talk, a lot of murder talk
Everybody gotta get the business when that thirty talk
Send that blitz and boys comin' full speed ahead
Niggas scared 'cause they know they say my name they end up dead, believe that

[Chorus: JayDaYoungan]
Somebody tell these pussy niggas I ain't playin'
You got a problem, I got answers
I sent a blessing, shooters come in while you layin'
Bitch we want all cancer, we come where you hangin'
Out the window, get to bangin', pussy bitch don't end up stankin'
Catch you slippin', we gon' slang it
And if you say my name, bitch it won't be no explainin'
All this fuck shit got me angry, leave you wet like if it rainin'

[Outro: JayDaYoungan]
You got problems, I got answers
Wet like if it rainin'
You got problems, I got answers
Wet like if it rainin'
