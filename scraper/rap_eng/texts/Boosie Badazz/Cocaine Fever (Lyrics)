First the coke was high and the rich got treated
Turned it into crack & the prices got cheaper
Frains got small & our brains got weaker
The money off the crack made us kill our own people
I did the same thing I use to serve my own people
Never in my head dat I murked my own people
Niggas tryna eat hustle coke like its legal
2005 alive jeezy heated up the fever
Lil boosie got the fever now
Cocaine fever
