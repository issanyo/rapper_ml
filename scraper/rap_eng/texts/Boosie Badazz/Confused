[Intro]
You know I've had a lifestyle
That many would dream of
I've had my share of jazzy women, classy women
And I've had my share of ratchets
I've even had my share of beautiful women
And I'm talkin' beautiful inside and out
But those women, I can't seem to do right by, you know
'Cause most times I wanna play
But sometimes I only want you

[Chorus]
Baby I'm confused, confused (Sometimes it's hard)
I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do sometimes)
Most times I wan' play, play, play (I just want to enjoy my life most times)
Sometimes I want only you (Sometimes it's just you and me, baby)
Baby I'm confused, confused (I'm confused)
I don't know what to do (Rappers gotta feel me on this one)
Most times I wan' play, play, play (I just wan' play, baby, that's all)
Sometimes I yearn for only you, baby (I be confused a lot)

[Verse 1]
I been slidin' in women with no huggin' or kissin'
Play and I play with no love or no feeling
But they pretty and ready (You lookin' nice tonight, baby)
(You're lookin' nice, too)
Pretty and ready, oh yeah, they so ready
Tonight I want that real, real, thing (I wan' feel you, baby)
No protection, baby (You know how we rockin')
'Cause I trust you, baby (I trust you, baby)
But soon it's gon' change, change, change
I'ma kick back and Boosie Badazz, baby
Might want another baby (You know how I am)
And another, and another

[Chorus]
Baby I'm confused, confused (Sometimes it's hard)
I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do sometimes)
Most times I wan' play, play, play (I just want to enjoy my life most times)
Sometimes I want only you (Sometimes it's just you and me, baby)
Baby I'm confused, confused (I'm confused)
I don't know what to do (Rappers gotta feel me on this one)
Most times I wan' play, play, play (I just wan' play, baby, that's all)
Sometimes I yearn for only you, baby

[Verse 2]
I woke up this morning
And I called my cousin Bronson
You know I can talk to B, you know
I said, "B, I'm sittin' in this big old bed
And I'm lonely as a motherfucker
Just me and these Backwoods" (Confused, confused)
He said, "Lil' cuz, maybe you need to find somebody special, man
And focus on that special somebody" (Confused, confused)
I told him, "Cuz, my trust for women
Was lost a long long time ago" (I'm confused)
I told him, "Cuz, man, I don't wanna be hurt, you know what I'm talkin' about?" (Confused, confused)
He said, "Boosie, I hear you talkin'" (Confused)
"But it's crazy 'cause you sayin' you don't wanna be hurt" (Confused)
"But you wanna hurt women"
I just stayed quiet on the phone

[Chorus]
Bronson, I'm confused, confused (I'm confused)
That's why I'm callin' you (Know I can talk to you)
Most times I wan' play, play, play (Most times I wanna play)
Sometimes I want only you (Sometimes I yearn for only you)
This life got me confused, confused, confused (Man, I'm confused)

[Outro]
It's hard to say no
When three or four beautiful women (I be confused)
Ask you to have you at one time (Woo)
Lord knows, Lord (I'm so confused)
You live this life (Sometimes I wanna play, play, play)
The life that we live, shit
You'll probably be confused too (Confused)
(Sometimes I be confused)
