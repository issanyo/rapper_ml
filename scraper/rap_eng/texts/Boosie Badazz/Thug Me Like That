[Intro]
Lil Boosie Badazz...

[Verse 1]
Nah I promise you to come home at night (yeah right)
I promise you to always treat you right (yeah right)
I promise to be down for you and never cheat (and never cheat)
But when I'm with a dime piece I can see them tears flyin' down your cheek
(Why you thug me like that) Cause I'm thug
I pull away from girls when we start fallin' in love
Was gonna take you on a cruise but I changed my mind (I changed my mind)
I always promise you the movies but I have no time
I'm with my niggas half the day and she ain't feelin' that (no)
While she at home cookin' and cleanin' I'm gettin' stacks
She love a nigga but I be damned if she trusts a nigga
But the sex still a 10 when we fuckin' nigga
And she like

[Hook] x4
Why you thug me like that (I swear to God)
I don't mean to
Sometimes I feel like I don't need you

[Verse 2]
Now I promise not to leave ya pussy wet (yeah right)
I promise you to show you some respect (yeah right)
I guess I live the life of a superstar
Drivin' all these fancy cars
And real talk I mayne I can have any broad
Plus I
I hate to see you cryin'
I hate to tell you lies
That's why deep inside she be like
"Boosie, Why you thug me like that?"
It's just in me
Been doin' girls wrong since I stepped off in McKinley
Hate to put my hands on ya cause I feel bad
I wear a rubber when I'm fuckin' but you don't feel that
They got a lot of women wrong
Got a lot of women strong
But when you got a superstar you gotta hold on
Superstar gon' try to fuck all these hoes (yeah right)
But when they zip down them bows everything alright
My nigga bleak he like "go home to your old lady
She catch your ass slippin' she gon' bust that 380"

[Hook] x4
Why you thug me like that (I swear to God)
I don't mean to
Sometimes I feel like I don't need you

[Verse 3]
Look this how I play it if I ever fuck with ya
I'mma fuck another girl see if you go fuck another nigga
(Why you thug me like that) Cause I'm Boosie Badazz
If she don't suck it I act mad
I can't do nothin' but laugh
I make these girls cook for me and don't even come by
I hope this dirty shit don't come back on Tarlaysia and I
I make the girl pussy wet when I look in her eyes
So Boosie never surprised when he get in them thighs
I got my heart broke at 14 that was way way back
So all the girls after that it was straight pay back
I like to lay back and take trips and dress you up
But when you start mouthin' off you messin' up
So shut it up
Would you forgive a real nigga (answer that) (for real)
Would you still be with him (answer that) (for real)
If he had another baby put you in a situation
Would you forgive him or leave him and hate him
Damn

[Hook] x4
Why you thug me like that (I swear to God)
I don't mean to
Sometimes I feel like I don't need you

X2
Boosie why you thug me
Boosie why you thug me
Boosie why you thug me like that

X2
Boosie why you thug me (I don't mean to)

Boosie why you thug me
Boosie why you thug me
Boosie why you thug me like that

And they don't even mean to
But at the same time
