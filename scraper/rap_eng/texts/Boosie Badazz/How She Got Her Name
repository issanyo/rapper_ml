That's how she got her name
That's how she got her name

[Verse 1]
She was a church girl, parents gave her everything
Had the best education but weak for conversation
She was chasing a life that she was blind to really
Fell hard for D-boys that never took her serious
And the L word made the church girl turn lame
Lil liquor in her system now she flipping, gettin' trained
Dude trip she move on now her sex sheet now river long
Nose still to the sky like she on, pussy wet she smell creed on Bond number 9
Ocean pussy, she was bad now the bitch ain't even fine
Look in her iPhone, every baller in the city
Now she sexually transmitted, don't know who even did it
Now she pointing fingers, need to reverse that finger
Got her daddy feeling bad like he a worthless preacher
People look and shake their heads, their conversation is her upbringing
That's how she got the name Quick Fuck Tina

[Chorus]
People use to love her, but she don't know
And she don't know
That's how she got her name
That's how she got her name
People use to love her, but she don't know
And she don't know
That's how she got her name
That's how she got her name

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you about Dirty Diana, she really come up with nothing
Uncle use to touch on her he was really a monster
And it affected her, gang banged niggas they respected her
The reason they respected her; she loved setting niggas up
Cut throat from her own granny, taking cash
A nigga break up with her, she send niggas to his stash
She was envious, fuck her best friend boyfriend
Tell her leave her boyfriend then she fuck her best friend
Had a face full of sympathy but heart cold-blooded
Stayed fresh all the time but her little girl had nothing
She would con people, everybody not some people
Steal your birth date, your social and have you wanted by the folk
Got worst when she turned to cocaine for a high
She was a no brainier, loose cannon and all that
Set a young nigga up for like two hunnid stacks
He came back, Rest in Peace Dirty Diana

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now Katie the Chaser, mama was a gold-digger
She looked up to her so she took the same road with her
Mama use to tell her if he ain't on don't talk
Showed her how to put on M.A.C, even showed her how to walk
Katie was real pretty nice ass, nice titties
15 had a nigga, 25 really gettin' it
He went to prison, she moved on, it was an never ending cycle
On to the next baller, her last she don't even write him
Go to rap concerts just to get backstage
Know it's a high percentage, they see her she getting saved
Gold chain, gold earrings, kept her a Benz
Played big head Tony when she really got in
Tony fell, she went to gold mouth L
He been around, let her run his ho shop a lil bit shit he put her down
Years later saw Katie and her weight decreased
Gold mouth dun gave her HIV, Katie the Chaser


[Chorus]
