[Intro]
Trouble on last, oh well
Here we go again, here we go again, here we go again
Trouble, always in trouble
Boosie Blues Cafe
Always in trouble

[Chorus]
I'm in trouble (I’m in trouble again)
Forgive me, Mother (Forgive me, Mother)
Forgive me, Mother (Forgive me, Mother)
But I'm back in trouble (Your son back in trouble)
Sorry Mama, I'm in trouble (I’m in trouble)
I can't win for losin' (Can't win for losin')
I stay in trouble (I been gettin' in trouble a long time)
Forgive me, Mother (Forgive me, Mother)
Forgive me, Brother (Forgive me, Brother)
But I'm back in trouble (I'm back in trouble)
Boosie back in trouble again
I’m in trouble (I’m in trouble)
I'm in trouble (I’m in trouble)

[Verse 1]
I went to prison (I went to the pen, real pen)
I hurt my mama (Hurt Miss Connie)
Hurt my fans (Hurt my fans)
I hurt my children (I hurt them babies and that hurts more than anything)
When they pointed me out, they counted me out
The lawyers was high, I wanted to cry
They took my music (Took all my money, I had to start from scratch)
The pressure was on, they thought I was gone
And guess what happened? I was found not guilty (God is good, yes he is, yes he is)
God, I'm back in trouble, hear me, Lord, I need you
Caught another charge in prison, I was nickin' (I needed it)
Needed Actavis, so I called my nigga (Titus and Que)
Now we in trouble (We in trouble)
I'm the reason we was messed up

[Chorus]
Forgive me, brother (Forgive me, brother)
You know I love you (You know that love)
You back in trouble (Back in trouble)
Who else I was gon’ call but y'all, nigga?
Forgive me, Mother (Forgive me, Mother)
Forgive me, Mother (Forgive me, Mother)
Your son back in trouble (Boosie back in trouble, yes I am)
Back in trouble (Back in trouble)
Stay in trouble (Stay in trouble)
I'm in trouble (Right now)

[Verse 2]
I can't get out (I can't go nowhere right now)
Cross my fingers (Cross my fingers)
Share my mother (Share my mother)
Where my Lord? (Where my Lord?)
Call my Lord (Call Jesus)
Tell him they tryna put somethin' else on me again
And I'm back in trouble (You know who you call first)
Call my mother (Call Miss Connie)
Tell her I love her (Tell her I love her)
If I don't be there for her birthday
Kiss her for me (Y'all kiss her for me)
'Cause I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)
This that struggle
Me and my girl done made a bag gettin' it in
Now she in trouble (Anita in trouble)
Too much trouble (It's too much trouble)

[Outro]
I'ma send this out to everybody
Who trouble seem to find when they ain't lookin' for it (Too much trouble)
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Always in trouble
Free Kodak
I'ma send this out to the mamas
Who got them hard ass kids (Stay in trouble)
Always in trouble
If you had a child stayed in trouble
You gotta feel this motherfucker right here
I told C-Murder and BG when they come home
No more trouble (No more trouble)
Free Bobby Shmurda, nigga
Told my mother (Told my mother)
Told my brother (Told TQ)
No more trouble
