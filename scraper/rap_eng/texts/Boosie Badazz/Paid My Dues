[Intro][Lil' Boosie]

I'mma send this out
To all those motherfucka's
Who don't respect my grind
Actin' like they don't know my struggle
Who act like I came out yesterday

[Hook][Lil' Boosie]

I done paid my dues (Strugglin')
Paid my dues (Hustlin')
I done paid my dues (Bust'in)
So i can't lose
I done paid my dues (Hustlin')
I done paid my dues (Strugglin')
I done paid my dues
Knocked some niggas out they shoes
I done paid my dues (Bust'in)
I done paid my dues (Strugglin)
I done paid my dues (Bust'in!)
Win or lose I paid my dues (I paid my dues)
I done paid my dues (Hustlin')
I done paid my dues (Strugglin')
I done paid my dues (Nigga!)
I done paid my... (Real talk nigga)

[Verse 1][Lil' Boosie]
I done paid my dues, I done lost some niggas
I done cross some niggas, I done did some shit
10 years spittin' this real shit down the pipe
Fuckin' right I done hustled' white
I done laid niggas down, I done ran the block
From the bottom to the top, I'm a gorilla
Ask the hood, I'm a good nigga!
Got the right to say I am Baton Rouge nigga!
I done made niggas money, you already know
Now It's time for Me to be a CEO
So after this album, I got to go
But if you need me nigga, I got you though
I done strapped in jail, no checkout nigga
I got the right to hold my chest out nigga
I never told on nobody, had pure cocaine like Yo Gotti
I done made niggas, I done saved niggas
When the boss shit came I did not run
Got the lawyer, made the bond, made real niggas out my lil' son
I done hit the interstate, plenty times
I-10 chain represent the grind
Day for day, dime for dime
? ?

[Hook]

I done paid my dues (Strugglin')

Win or lose I paid my dues (I paid my dues)
I done paid my dues (Hustlin')
I done paid my dues (Strugglin')
I done paid my dues (Nigga!)
I done paid my... (Real shit!)

[Verse 2][Lil' Boosie]
You already know, show for show
State for state, I done made the cake
I done took my niggas across the world
Did so much for they boy's and girl's
I done gave away so much to kids
Swear to God, I love the kids!
But I'm bout mine, I slang iron
I gotta rep the street, don't fuck with his
I done paid my dues, win or lose
I'm like B.B. King when you talk the blues
Went from wang-dang chains to bling bling (Bitch)
But I deserve it
Been true to the game, I taught people
When the hurricane came, I housed people
When the lights off, I done came through
A lot of niggas mad cause they ain't Boosie
I done road for my dogs, retaliation
"Fa, Fa, Fa", No hesitation when
I done jumped out the car with pistols
So Big Mel, wouldn't go to jail
Shit that wasn't supposed to be said on songs
I said it, cause I tell the truth!

[Hook]

I done paid my dues (Strugglin')
Paid my dues (Hustlin')
I done paid my dues (Bust'in)
So i can't lose
I done paid my dues (Hustlin')
I done paid my dues (Strugglin')
I done paid my dues
Knocked some niggas out they shoes
I done paid my dues (Hustlin')
I done paid my dues (Strugglin)
I done paid my dues (Bust'in!)
Win or lose I paid my dues (I paid my dues)
I done paid my dues (Hustlin')
I done paid my dues (Strugglin')
I done paid my dues (Nigga!)
I done paid my... (Let me talk to em' right quick!)

[Verse 3][Lil' Boosie]
Real talk, I've done it all
Twelve years old, stealin' out the mall
I done ball till' I fall and got back up
I done fucked every bitch you tryna' cut
I'm a damn good daddy, you already know
But I took my liquid child support
I done beat them bitches in court
So many times, I ain't lying
I done seen dead bodies, young as hell
Real talk, know some niggas on that real
My music hold em' down
I done damn near been killed by the k9
Had to wrestle niggas tryna' take mine
In the hospital bout' to die
Woke up and saw little blinking eyes
I done been bust' on a couple times
I didn't get hit I'm a black cat
Nine lives, fuckin' right I'm a little long
I grind and got my own home
X, pills, and PCP, ain't none of that shit stopped a G
A big dog, chasin' cheese
Gettin' followed by the F.E.D.S

[Hook]

I done paid my dues (Strugglin')

So i can't lose
I done paid my dues (Hustlin')
I done paid my dues (Strugglin')

Knocked some niggas out they shoes
I done paid my dues (Hustlin')
