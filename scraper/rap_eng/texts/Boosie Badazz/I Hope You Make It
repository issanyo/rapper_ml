[Intro]
Boosie Badazz
I'ma send this out, to all the niggas doin 30-40 years, life sentences, fightin' life sentences and shit
Send this out to that woman with HIV, tryna make it, you know, for that nigga, shootin' that ball tryna go to the league you know, hope you make it

[Verse 1]
For my black sister who have it hard, tryna find rides for her kids right now
Her baby daddy on a bid right now
I hope your days are filled with laughter, no tears after
I pray your man done learned some sense, all them years captured
Jump out the gym, this lil nigga, he touched the shot clock
But his friends thugs, will his thugs, be his shot block
He cooked a rock pot, I hope your friends solid and still
I pray forgiveness for all the real niggas, if you listenin'

[Chorus: Boosie Badazz & Anthony Hamilton]
I hope you make it, through the struggle, know a nigga love you, say thug I woke up early to pray for you, God's got a plan for you
I hope you make it, through the hard times, we can don't stop, babygirl, I woke up early cuz i'm prayin' for you

[Verse 2]
Babygirl, I hope you make it, through that pregnancy, through that car wreck, that fucked up your face, your feet, changed your life, made your nigga leave
Single momma I hope you make it through this drama and what this world got comin'
Its hard to live by the rules when your lil girl got nothin, you strugglin'
He facin' life and 40 years, bein' lawyer to his peers, he'll get out and get to the biz, he need a lawyer though
She just 16, she got two kids, momma don't wanna watch her kids
You tell her you love her, you got her, she need a father

[Chorus: Boosie Badazz & Anthony Hamilton]
I hope you make it, through the struggle, know a nigga love you, say thug I woke up early, God's got a plan for you
I hope you make it, through the hard times, we can yours mine, it ain't over thug, God got a plan for you

[Verse 3]
Do your time, I pray your time get easy, after three or four years
I pray your trigger get easy, after three or four kids
I pray for that playground, no violence
Pray for that playground, your patnas
Pray they don't lay down your patnas
It ain't safe in your projects
I pray they cut my taxes down
Don't bring a rat around
I pray for freedom for all the real niggas
B.G. gone walk it out
I pray the rats stop talkin' now
Pray he don't leave it at the house
Murder one, his nigga lost, he sniffin soft now

[Chorus: Boosie Badazz & Anthony Hamilton]
I hope you make it, through the struggle, know a nigga love you, I been thinkin all night, I said a prayer for you, God got a plan for you
I hope you make it, through the hard times, we can don't stop, no need to have an ol lady if she ain't gon grind with you, I hope ya'll make it
I hope everybody see better days, no hate in me
I hope you make it, ooh through the hard times, know a nigga love ya, know we prayin for ya, hope you make it, hope you make it make it yea, hope you really make it, hope you really make it
I hope you make it
