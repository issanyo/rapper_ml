[Hook]
You see the trap booming, you see the traffic coming
You see we getting money, go on, nigga, hate me
Nigga, I grind hard, that’s where I shine hard
Homie, your kind flauged, go on, nigga, hate me
I know your nuts crossed ‘cause I fuck with [?]
I don’t give a fuck, dog, go on, nigga, hate me
Go on, nigga, hate me, go on, nigga, hate me
Go on, nigga, hate me, go on, nigga, hate me

[Verse]
Well, it’s Boosie and they hate on me, but don’t nobody play with me
The last nigga tried me got found by somebody
In the hood, I’m like Gotti, I’m the sickest on the beat
All the hoes suck on my meat like I’m a fucking swisher sweet
Like trying hit after hit, nigga talked about me bad
But I get that chopper out that trunk and make at talk to your ass
[?] Daddy wouldn’t [?], I learned from other niggas
I learned from hustle niggas, but it’s all gravy, man
Front the club, I [?] shine, push whip, six at a time
I’m in the dope, getting mine, hated on all the time
Got my neck right, got my wrist right
Three or four choppers, niggas would stop you in that signal light
But niggas wanna murder me ‘cause I be counting big money on my DVD
Devil, get up off me
Nephew, let’s get them [?] I done talked about
And I’m the truth, dog, from Baton Rouge to Duval

[Hook]
You see the trap booming, you see the traffic coming
You see we getting money, go on, nigga, hate me
Nigga, I grind hard, that’s where I shine hard
Homie, your kind flauged, go on, nigga, hate me
I know your nuts crossed ‘cause I fuck with [?]
I don’t give a fuck, dog, go on, nigga, hate me
Go on, nigga, hate me, go on, nigga, hate me
Go on, nigga, hate me, go on, nigga, hate me
