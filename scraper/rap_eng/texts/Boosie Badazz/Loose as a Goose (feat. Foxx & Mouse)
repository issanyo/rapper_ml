I be loose as a goose, loose as a goose

I be loose as a goose, don't get me started
2 shots of Patron and I'm on in da party
I be loose as a goose, don't get me started
Wit a click of thug niggas when I step off in da party

Loose as a goose, don't get me started
Full of dat liquor when I step up in da party
I be loose as a goose, don't get me started
Gone of dem jiggaz when I step up in da party

Knock, knock, knock, knock, don't get me started
Cause I'll wild out and cock da Glock 40
Knock, knock, knock, knock, don't get me started
Cause it can get retarded, you heard me retarded

Got a body bag and a couple o' mask

Comin' through da club, man, I got my own swag
Don't look wrong cause I will get on yo' ass

Goons on deck, all my niggas actin' bad

Always good lookin', my mouth kinda crooked

I be loose as a goose, don't get me started
2 shots of Patron and I'm on in da party
I be loose as a goose, don't get me started
Wit a click of thug niggas when I step off in da party

Loose as a goose, don't get me started
Full of dat liquor when I step up in da party
Loose as a goose, don't get me started

And I'm standin' where da dough at, we buyin' all da Moet
You betta take yo' hoe and leave if we ain't got yo' hoe yet
I'm loose like a goose, wit a duce of dat juice
It might slow yo' ass down but to me it's a boost

I'm a muthafuckin' gangsta in da club, where da G's at?
And I ain't talkin' car when they ask you where da ki's at
Make yo' ol lady put her head where her knees at
If you don't break it off they a find her where da leaves at

Dolla, dolla bill all a nigga really need
I knew how ta count da money before I knew how to read
Bet dat choppa go and knock a nigga arm out his sleeve
Cause when I get loose, somebody child gon' bleed

I be loose as a goose, don't get me started
2 shots of Patron and I'm on in da party
I be loose as a goose, don't get me started
Wit a click of thug niggas when I step off in da party

Loose as a goose, don't get me started
Full of dat liquor when I step up in da party
Loose as a goose, don't get me started
