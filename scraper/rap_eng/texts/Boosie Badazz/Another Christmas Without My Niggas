[Intro]
Savage Holidays
Miss them, nigga
You are listening to a Dominic Green production
Another one, fuckin' 'nother one

[Verse 1]
Who got five on a sack of killer? (Go half, nigga)
Daily, we life of sin
It was Optimos or the Phillies (After that?)
Washin' it down with gin
Never thought you wouldn't be with me Christmas (Lil' nigga)
Remind me of that shit we did
New Year's, we cut up, we shoot them pistols
Over and over and over again
Miss my friend
(Clutchin' on the forty, got it hangin' out the shirt, ain't no hoes over here)
Miss my friend
(Said the same shit every New Year's, him sayin' this is our year)
Miss my friend
Wish I was here with a nigga
In the club throwin' fours like yeah
Miss my G
So I need trees when I'm lookin' at the Christmas tree
What this is?

[Chorus]
Another Christmas without my niggas (Another Christmas)
Must admit that I'm in my feelings (Lord)
Another Christmas without my niggas (My dawg)
Must admit that I'm in my feelings (Another Christmas)
Another Christmas without my niggas (My dawg)
Must admit that I'm in my feelings (Straight up)
Another Christmas without my dawgs (My dawg)
I wan' talk to you now, dawg, I wanna call

[Verse 2]
I wish you could hang this up on the tree (Man)
Put the star at the top
But I'm left with you lookin' down, watchin' me (I know you watchin')
Watchin' me hit the top
Crawfish, we ate and we celebrated (How we comin')
Boilin' it out the pot
If you ever got mad 'bout a situation (Sorry, nigga)
I'm tellin' you sorry now
Back in my feelings like a motherfucker
Lookin' in the club, when I see a nigga hug
Then I go to thinkin' 'bout my thug
Thinkin' how we used to thug in the same motherfuckin' club
And it get worser on the holidays
I think about how we all had J's for Christmas
Play spades for Christmas (Yeah, nigga)
I hear your song, and I think of you again, nigga
Here we go again (What this is?)

[Chorus]
Another Christmas without my niggas (Another Christmas)
Must admit that I'm in my feelings (Lord)
Another Christmas without my niggas (My dawg)
Must admit that I'm in my feelings (Another Christmas)
Another Christmas without my niggas (My dawg)
Must admit that I'm in my feelings (Straight up)
Another Christmas without my dawgs (My dawg)
I wan' talk to you now, dawg, I wanna call

[Bridge]
Miss my dawg
Motherfuck the stockings on the wall
Wish my dawg, he could answer my call
Miss my dawg
Shoppin' at the mall, big ball
On them 'ppeals, bitch, we'll blow it all
Don't you miss your dawg?
When you ain't got nobody to call
'Cause you know they gon' tell it all
That's when you miss your dawg (That's when you miss your dawg)
Yeah, miss your dawg

[Chorus]
Another Christmas without my niggas (Fucked up)
Must admit that I'm in my feelings (I rode, nigga, yeah)
Another Christmas without my niggas (Certified stepper)
Must admit that I'm in my feelings (Yeah, I swung, nigga, yeah)
Another Christmas without my niggas (Still swingin', nigga, yeah)
Must admit that I'm in my feelings (Yeah, nigga, straight up)
Another Christmas without my dawgs (I miss my nigga, yeah)
I wan' talk to you now, dawg, I wanna call (Yeah, blood behind that nigga, any day)
