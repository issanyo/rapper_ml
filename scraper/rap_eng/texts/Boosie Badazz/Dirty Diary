[Intro]
Dirty diary, diary
This that dirty diary nigga
Oh lord
Dirty diary, diary, diary

[Verse 1]
You heard old boy got his issue
Guess when they come they don't miss you
Too many dead, I need tissues
This life is so far from pretty
Rest in peace to my hitters
Those in my killer committee
Lil Ivy Ghost and Lil Bleek
We wrote y'all name in the street
I'm sorry for all the problems that I couldn't solve without talkin'
Rest in peace to that Problem and everybody we lost
My heart goes out to Lil Titus, because of me you went a bin
I took that chance with my man, tried to sip some fuckin' codeine

[Chorus]
Dirty diary
Dirty diary, oh lord, dirty, dirty, dirty
Dirty diary, diary (dirty diary)
Dirty diary, dirty, dirty, dirty

[Verse 2]
I pray you wake up safe and well, I hope you covered in grace
I hope your teachers teach you well while I play with Lay-Lay
Me, Turk, and Mel back, all love, one time I wish that I'm hatin'
Not knowin' the CEO rode 'til I got in they place
Donkey I'm sorry with all my heart that you got shot in your face
I could've told you slow your roll but told the opposite way
Mama I just wan' see us happy, I don't wan' argue today
This family starting to look like daddy would say, huh

[Chorus]
Dirty diary
Dirty diary, oh lord, dirty, dirty, dirty
Dirty diary, diary (dirty diary)
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I look in the mirror like why I'm so underrated?
If you name one nigga realer, man I can argue time eight
Apologize to my uncles for always sellin' you yay
So sorry Bleek, I was chosen, I miss you thug every day
I'm sorry Dawg I couldn't pick up, man it was so much to date
I love you nigga and I keep the faith that you'll be home one day
All my niggas in the hood, always been down with me
But still I gotta wonder, who gon' ride for me?

[Chorus]
Dirty diary
Dirty diary, oh lord, dirty, dirty, dirty
Dirty diary, diary (dirty diary)

[Outro]
This should make you buy my album five times
Me givin' you my (me givin' you my)
Dirty diary, diary
This should make you buy my album five times
Me givin' you my
Me reachin' inside
For dirty diary
