[Intro]
I'ma send this mothafucka here to the mothafuckin' crackers
Rot in hell mothafucka, plotting on my diamonds

[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
They killed Venelle when I was 12, turned me against 'em
Sent me to my first funeral now I'm a victim (of the law)
My daddy called 'em pigs, I'll never forget
He went to jail on Highland road, for tryna piss
Kicked my Auntie Trina door, lookin' for my cousin
Looked at me 'cross the street and said boy you ugly
May 11, dat was my first run in with dem busters
When stupid roughed me up cause I told em mothafucka
Got old it got worser, my hustle got deadly
Runnin' and duckin' from dat dirty bitch Don Kelly
All from school you can catch me with my tool
Smashing in my Magnum from the red white and blue
Dey ask me for money, try to bribe me and all
Dey let the dogs eat me up, up out my fuckin' nuts
Don't give a fuck nigga freedom or jail
I want all you bitches to rot in hell

[Hook]
Cities, fuck 'em, narcotics, fuck 'em
FEDS, fuck 'em, DAs, fuck 'em
We don't need you bitches on our street say with me
FUCK THE POLICE (fuck 'em) FUCK THE POLICE (fuck 'em)
Without dat badge you a bitch and a half nigga
FUCK THE POLICE (fuck 'em) FUCK THE POLICE (fuck 'em)
Without dat badge you a bitch and a half nigga
FUCK THE POLICE (fuck 'em) FUCK THE POLICE (fuck 'em)

[Verse 2: Webbie]
Come search this bitch cause I don't do weight
'Cause I'm too straight and y'all lil bitches a lil too late
Cuffed me up in front of my kids; I looked em all in they faces
Walked me out like I'm a killa, scared the fuck out my neighbors
Sat me down put a pen and paper on the table and told me
Give us some names and you can leave this bitch
I can't believe this shit, what in the hell
If that's the only way out den nigga show me my cell
Look tell niggas stop, I'll sit here 'til I rot
For all dat, I coulda been a bitch ass cop
Yea Boo I got got, they hit me for a few thou
But you dirty bitches I'm ballin' I ain't miss it at all
Soon as I got back to the house I went and opened a pound
And counted out 700 so much shit ain't get found
And I know tha police listening I'm telling you now
You can never hold a trill nigga down, nigga fuck ya

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
Dis shit a neva stop, let's keep it real Yokk
We need to be like Cali niggas, and kill cops
Plus stupid you stupid, I hope you rot in hell
You lost B, you jost Trell and want T and L
Wonder why I look at yo ass undereye
I get a billion I'm a hit you bitches from tha sky
You gone be dead just like Ivy, a tear drop
FEDS cities I want all of you bitches killed now
Yea we used to run dat dope, ya already know
Served dem birds from 17th to Platcha Court
Took my Beamer I'll never forget
Not enough money in tha bank and dey can take yo shit
Dey went in Webbie house tha otha day (dirty mothafuckas)
Took a $100, 000 away, ain't turn it in
Dey sin, dey don't protect shit
Sincerely yours Mr. Bad Azz, suck my dick and die quick bitch

[Hook]
