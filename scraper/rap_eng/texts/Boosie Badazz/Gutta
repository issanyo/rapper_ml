[Chorus:]
Gutta Gutta Gutta Gutta  [x3]
Meet me on the Gutta, Gutta, Gutta, Gutta, Gutta
Girls gone crazy
Got the whole club jumping like a Gutta, Gutta, Gutta, Gutta
Out the Gutta, Gutta, Gutta, Gutta [x2]
Ya’ll nigga, Ya’ll nigga
Ya’ll nigga made it out the Gutta, Gutta, Gutta, Gutta

[Verse 1:]
It’s a young nigga made it out the gutta when they tug on you
Put it right there in the club on you
I am so gutta you dig
I use to hustle in Paris
I use to run from them pigs
Smashing a honey
You don’t know my struggle
Boy I will  get you the beef
How you think I got my bust
Gutta Gutta
All I know is get up if you fall down
All I know I’ll shoot if you draw down
Real nigga from a little small town
Whole clit Gutta, Gutta, Gutta, Gutta
All I know is bankk rose
Raised in the crack
Ever with the jerry curls and the kangoos
Pills to grab handles
We in the van though
I guy got flip flap handle
We started a picture but why
The big doogie get in the middle
Been doing this shit since we was little
When we started flippers
Remember that cold december in the Gutta
When we were fighting, and gambling each other
Hustling all night, building our muscle
Man I’m glad I made it out the motherfucking Gutta

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Grinding out the Gutta for a minute
OG dollar sign bitch trying to get it
Twenty G’s a piece and we are still ya’ll nigga ain’t shit to a pimp
I got niggas in this Gutta
I got woman in this Gutta
I did house is Gutta
I stepped on the carpet, red bottoms is Gutta
Pulling up like my girl cheating on me
Like I’m something mean
Got the scheming on me
Got these bitches sweating
Cause the heat is on me
Yes of course, that’s originally
Niggas call me crazy, special education
My lack of pages, maybe smack a nigga
Like a pimp man, sit back
Get back, please tell me where the paper at
I’m the hottest thing no debate nigga
I get many money why you hate nigga
2015 we assassinating
How the hell you plug it in, you ain’t clocking nigga
Stay steady before I start smacking niggas
Three piece at the coast captain nigga
Everything good and it’s natural
Still in the hood dressing casual

[Chorus]
