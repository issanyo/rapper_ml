[Intro:]
I'm tired of all these bitch ass niggas asking me when I'm gonna drop
I got you niggas now. Say Mel and T gonna get this shit pressed up (uh huh ) I'm Ready!
(I'm ready) cause I'm tired of these niggas asking me

[Hook]
They like look Boosie when you gonna drop, why not Boosie is you're gonna flop nigga, un un
Boosie where been nigga I've been on the block at studios, selling blocks, whatever it takes to make a knot

[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
I ain't fucking with this dubbind shit the whole world loving this
Bow down and suck this dick you are the rap fucking trick
14 15 I told that I had a dream
16 17 I was selling crack to crack fiens
I live this shit so get it right
My phone won't let me sleep at night
My Razor phone is prepaid
Them nextels they like AIDS
They Dangerous, They Gangsterous like all my niggas who hang with us
All my niggas who bang with us wear trill entertainment chains with us
I made you wait until the winter now I got you cold
2006 I'm in this bitch now I got control
Gucci shades that's what I floss with
My bitch don't window shop she goes in and shop for raw shit
I told her outside fuck this
Letâ€™s hit them with a double disc
Me and Lil Webbie we drop more hits that Snoop Dog and Ludacris
You ain't heard about this Boosie shit open you ears
When you open you ears welcome to Phil nigga
Man I've been hot selling out the stores
But always lose my CEO's
Love to fuck with gangsters I don't affiliate with hoes
First I got to do my promo shows that gonna be hell
Gotta do my interview like 50 that gonna make Lil B sell
Gotta ease my mind in with Reese Keese down ATL
Gotta leave the work to B and Trayl for the judge send me to jail
I'm thugged out but you can't tell
Was drugged out now I'm mell
Don't smoke nothing, don't drank nothing
You play me I'm gonna swang something
Since been gonna my feelings gone
Mane they did my nigga wrong
If you think you're the sickest
Confess and say you did it
This album gonna be the sickest
That's on my pops
He put that dang-a-lang in my momma 9 months later I drop
He told never smoke rock
Told me how he hate cops
He watching over be the bad ass drop
Here go bad ass pops

Daddy watch over me the bad ass drop and mama ain't gotta work no more believe that

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Lil Boosie]
I sick of a nigga with a 100 bricks
Watch Lil Boosie running shit
We dick hoes down for hours
While you one niggas coming quick
We flip these hoes like dominos
Niggas better hide your hoes
We snatch you all hoes out Magic City
And make them hoes get ratchet with it
I'm dicking dicking down south new makeover
And niggas Louisiana takeover
And like Hova I'm versatile
Real niggas gonna retire
I'm be like George Clinton round this bitch spiting that 45
With this little light of mine
I'm gonna shine
You ain't got be featured on my tape I don't need you niggas anyway
All my hoes thong drop
Yeah, I take they thong off
"Boosie when your album drop?"
As soon as you finish swelling
I'm finished thank you
Pull your draws up on your waist
Wipe that shit up out your face
And let's go get an Outback Steak
Cause Bad Ass done dropped today
This what you gonna snatch today
This the sickest dub edition since 2Pac done passed away
So you ain't gotta ask today
When I'm coming is you following
This bitch in done with so ask about the Golden Child
Big stacks I'm holding now
Big Gaks I'm buss 'em
Big nights I fuck 'em, hand cuff 'em, cause I don't trust 'em
2004 I was balling woah did you see the DVD
I can hear Pimp C hollin about "look at me, look at me"
I'm the spices in the gumbo
I'm the fries at popeyes
I ain't retarded I'm retunto
Compared to no nigga at all
Cause I'm a dog
In the rock I'm a Pit
And I stopping for shit I'm full blooded
All my niggas go fearless from New York to Philly
From Detroit to my State
In Florida I am heavyweight
In Georgia got real estate
California affiliate
Jackson Mississippi got my back like thats my living state
Saint Louis and Mobile they clock steel and pop pills
Savannah Georgia they K kill can forget about J-ville
A-town and D-town they grab keys like rebounds
Arkansas is straight rage
They shoot niggas on stage
Fear payed and chess say
I end you fucking career nigga
Hit you with they steel nigga you won't feel that pill nigga
Can't no rapper fucking with me
Hit you from my way look like Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili
Ask about me if you don't know me and that's off the top
He watching over me the bad ass drop here go bad ass pop
