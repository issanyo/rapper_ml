Yeah
So you sho you wanna be a gangsta?
Sure bout dat lil daddy?

[Verse 1:]
Take a walk across that track where you see junkies pheens and robbers
Calicos and choppas infa-reds that spot yah
My niggas got on dem reeboks wit dem baby 9's tucked
Hollin I don't give a fuck if you love yo hood then throw it up
Now where the prayas prayers to us we need a Mill. man
Two days from Christmas and I gotta pay the bills man
So I'm on a rainy night with a gangsta who don't play no games
He love them fortys and them fortys don't get jam man
Now you wanna be gangsta step to me and you gon' disappear
My momma raised all dicks it ain't no pussy here
Now I love them gangstas from the lil ones to the ol g's
From the weed papers to the Optimo leaves we blow trees
So think about it when you step in that water
You wanna thug but you gotta thug harder nigga

[Chorus: x4]
So you sho you wanna be a gangsta?
Boosie I'm thuggin I ain't backin down from nothin I'm bout bussin

[Verse 2:]
Verse two for the niggas who knock knock who really wanna chop
For the niggas who change like grades and made me write that animosity
For the niggas who rap about you but that only make you betta
Everytime I hear my name its like anotha love letter
This for them niggas worst than you dude
For them niggas who petti jack for thowbacks and Fubu
For the niggas who steady stack ya playem' they a shoot you
For the one who drop hits on you bitches like Lil Boo do
You don't know bout the game you need a nigga to come and school you
You don't know bout this pain yo closest nigga he a fool you
You bust and you bang
Man you betta get ya bread cuz niggas comin to get yah behind the color blue wit
Red Anotha shot of that hen I'm gon be tipsy man
Since they killed solja you will neva catch me slippin man
Lets grip this thing and fill our enemies with hot lead
Bury me thuggin I ain't scared just like Pac said
But I'm tired of runnin from guns too much smoke in my lungs
But they keep callin back so I gotta make runs

[Chorus: x4]
So you sho you wanna be a gangsta?
Boosie I'm thuggin I ain't backin down from nothin I'm bout bussin

[Verse 3:]
You sho bout this yea you don't know bout this yea
Well is you down to bust a head (Head you know I ain't scared)
Well it take way more than half of you cross the track to the depth
Since you gon tat that on yo arm you gotta be bout that there
Meet me at twelve on the corner in the projects
