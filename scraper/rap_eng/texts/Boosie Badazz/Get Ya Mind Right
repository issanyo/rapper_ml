[VERSE 1]
You's a bitch

You's a pussy
You remind me of a pussy name (Nussie)
You's a coward
You's a faker
You's a snitch
Do me a favor
And get off a nigga dick

Stunt wit' a pistol
But you call yo self a gangsta
You want my chain
Well I want yo fuckin brain then nigga

For like 40 minutes straight
Big bags on tha gram
Ima put it in yo face
Ima keep it in tha street
If I ever catch a case

I'm tha realist nigga in it
Can't nobody take my place
Boosie

Shoot up all yo people
