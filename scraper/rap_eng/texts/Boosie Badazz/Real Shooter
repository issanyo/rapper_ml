[Intro]
Man, what the fuck this nigga want?
Shit 4:30 in the morning
Calling a nigga this fucking early, this nigga crazy

[Verse 1]
Phone rang, it’s my nigga G tryna get some victims
Boss man, what’s happening with ya, nigga?
Let me clear the business
Yo I got it but not this instance
Yo boss, them boys slippin
Before y’all get in position, we gon stalk him and we gon flip him
We ain’t talking if they come get us only statement
Where’s my lawyer?
You know Jason on the way, when the cold in [?]
Not talking man what’s important
Anybody can shoot
Y’all go for all that shit
But now them boys be with Boosie

Fuck with us boy you stupid
We clutch and we all go use it
Fuck with us y’all go lose it
We won street wars, nigga
So ain’t no telling what we will do to you little rap boys who act hard
I sent an army of commandos and Rambos
Niggas who watch you all night through gazelles, not binoculars
Smash and go eat tilapia
Laugh at you over dinner
Focusin eyes open there’s no laughing when we in that rental
