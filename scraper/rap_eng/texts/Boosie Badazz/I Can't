All this work all these late nights
Still no sleep I can’t lay right
At rap bins and I feel when I’m in it
Street campaign like I’m running for the senate
Time got me feeling I’m the realest around
Running with the stars but I’m still on the ground

Laughing at them hater niggas should’ve been clowns
Getting to hyped imma get to calming them down
Shoulda played ball I’m still on the turf
All I know is there be solid begin different a curse

Say my name in the city
Here to show what I’m worth
Chose to be a king since the day of my birth
Still reppin for the six and when they’re teaching the drill
While they put em in the trap tryna teach em a skill
I’m tryna see em live brother teach em the bill
Yeah my brother doing life tryna get an appeal
Shit

I can’t
I can’t I can’t
I can’t
I can’t I can’t
I can’t I can’t
I can’t I can’t

I can’t give a damn about niggas
They ain’t give a damn about me look
I can’t give a damn about bitches
That ain’t give a fuck about me
Man I can’t do nothing for these niggas
That ain’t done shit for me you know
I can’t do nothing for these hoes
You know it

Fuck you pay me ain’t shit for free
Fuck you pay me ain’t shit for free
Fuck you pay me ain’t shit for free
Ain’t shit for free
This shit ain’t cheap

Asshole king
I was set in my ways
I’ve got me water I was riding my waves
Gang chained up gets your witness as slaves
Who they fucking with imma get to sending them K’s

Few days on the block when I’m pitching my plays
Loyal to my dogs I was running with strays
Price on ya head I can get you a praise
I’m forever in the hood like I’m stuck in a maze

Ain’t above plus on the foreign I can’t crawl it
Different time zone low tone I can’t call it
I don’t really know bout much but getting to it
Haters getting pressed on site I can’t stall it

I’m on this black clout
Picture me coming down
Picture my name is track & field
I’m tryna run them thing
One of the greater leads
I would never throw me down
And if they really shit nigga I don’t fuck around


I can’t
I can’t I can’t
I can’t
I can’t I can’t
I can’t I can’t
I can’t I can’t

I can’t give a damn about niggas
They ain’t give a damn about me look
I can’t give a damn about bitches
That ain’t give a fuck about me
Man I can’t do nothing for these niggas
That ain’t done shit for me you know
I can’t do nothing for these hoes
You know it

Fuck you pay me ain’t shit for free
Fuck you pay me ain’t shit for free
Fuck you pay me ain’t shit for free
Ain’t shit for free
This shit ain’t cheap

Four Glocks in the drop
As we ride through the boss way
Getting before the age of 24
Thousand square feet long wait from the hallway

Why should I give a fuck about a nigga
Who ain’t never gave a fuck about me
Answer that
Lavender you know that we ain’t having that
A plus in the kitchen I could bring it back

Jose ain’t even talked to me
No trust in the world they was crossing me
I remember they were Dog or G
Shit changed now hoe
Hey you already know
You can’t ball with me

I don’t owe a nigga nothing
Not a dollar bill or too many discussion
Stop playing
I could dirty like a rush draw now
He be always double couple
H-town

I’m tryna live like J now
I’m on the island oversea like fuck that shit
Somebody say something we ain’t saying nothing back
Cause they niggas dead broke
And we livin like that
From the era of the crack
When niggas rap bout how they sold you
And everybody rap how they on drugs

Rip Freyto Chi Ki nigga

If anybody talk bad about me nigga
They got shit in they mouth cause I be shitting on niggas
But I keep it real I don’t shit on niggas
Four or five hustles like TIP on
Niggas

Sip strong nigga & we blazing
All bad bitches no basic
You ain’t tryna help me coming up
And I couldn’t come to you if I was stuck
So why should I give a fuck

I can’t
I can’t I can’t
I can’t
I can’t I can’t
I can’t I can’t
I can’t I can’t
