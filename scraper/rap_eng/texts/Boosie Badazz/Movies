[Verse 1 - Boosie]
I wanna thank god for blessing me to hit you with this recipe

But I know you scared of me, bitch
Don't wanna holla, bitch

Can't get no features on my album nigga scared of lil Boosie
So when you ask me what it do, I'mma tell 'em fuck you
And when you mention me its negative its never positive
They can down talk about me but I got a lot of skills
I got a lil though, to make these niggas suffer
Y'all rapping and rhyming I tell life stories motherfucker
You thank that you can hold me back
Bitch I been retarded
And I got respect regardless if I don't hit carpet
Look, I'm finna make 'em caught hell, you saw the XXL

That mouth and that cat

[Hook - Boosie]
All you niggas wanna be killas

All you rappers wanna be actors
Better stay in the movies
And don't fuck around with Boosie
I thank they scared mane I thank these nigga scared

[Verse 2 - Boosie]
I took a walk by the big dogs, nigga turning they head
They listen to my music, but can't holla
Dem nigga scared
But its cool with me
Bitch you know where Boosie
In yo city on yo stage do what you gone do to me
After my shows I'm wit my fans giving kisses and hugs
While you get bodyguard by other punks who wanna be thugs
You niggas lying on yo records
Bitch you got me heated
Hannibal Lecter one of you bitches
Cut ya tongue out make you eat it
They burning my CD's, burning my CD's
Well that burning my CD's made the whole hood believe
Now they got my back no matter what
Every street, every alley, every corner with that fire marijuana
They got Boosie in the deck and Boosie got respect
When them other rappers hear me
I put goose bumps up on they neck
To his throne I'm a treat
Mane I'm young but I'm a vet
Mane I'm right behind you in line (Nigga)
And I'm next

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Boosie]
You niggas going platinum selling more then my click
But ain't nobody at yo shows
I know you feel like a bitch
Because yo street credit is nothing
Compared to me who thuggin'
And by the way on or under you'll one hit wonder
And I drop hit after hit
You ain't gotta fast forward shit
Just put me in and let me roll
I bet you say I'm ice cold
I'm shinning like a light pole
Got niggas looking' stupid
I got more ice then some of them clowns who play on movies
And Its bright night, I thank they scared of me
He saw his bitch checking me out now he handcuffing
If you ain't never lived that life then don't rap bitch
If you ain't never ran the streets
You need and map bitch and cold cut sandwich
I'mma tell ya I don't feel that nigga
He only show up once a year ole' mac rib ass nigga
So I be like foe I lay me down to sleep
I know that they don't want no beef, ahhhh

I thank these nigga scared
