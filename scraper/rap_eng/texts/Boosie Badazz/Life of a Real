Chorus 2x

Boosie Bad Azz

I told all my niggas
No man or women shall separate what we create
Some niggas died
Some niggas joke
Some niggas ball and make it
Some niggas fake and say they real in every fuckin' verse
Them hope to bees and wannabees
They gone say it first
Don't it hurt deep inside
When a nigga turn bitch
Let a bitch take his figures
Separate his niggas
Ain't it funny wit tha money
Everything change
You keep it real wit yo nigga in tha chain gang
When it all fall down can you maintain
Stay real stay silent without no fuckin' violence
If a nigga crossed the line
Would you solve the problem
I got yo back nigga
I got yo back nigga

Real niggas
I'mma send this motherfucker here
I'mma send this bitch to all my real niggas
Cross the world
Who live by or die by whatever they do
Weather hustling rap hustling
Going to school hustling
Or block hustling whatever you do
This for my real niggas
Money don't make boosie bad azz
Torrance Hatchet
Just me just me
That's it
I'mma take all this jeweler off right now
Still me
