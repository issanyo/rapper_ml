[Intro]
Halloween (Halloween, Halloween)
Boosie Badazz (Boosie Badazz, Boosie Badazz)
Too many people got on meth
That's why I call it Halloween

[Hook]
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
So many niggas wearing masks
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
So many hoes turn nasty
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
You was my nigga dog, what happened?
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween

[Verse 1]
Went to the corner store
Junkie asking for some dollars but he ain't even broke
This Halloween
Seen a nigga do his boy wrong, nigga had a mask on
Smiled in his face, he left the house now his stash gone
Police got a mask on, bitches blast Mike Brown
Niggas say they real but talk like bitches with tights on
Niggas wearing masking, lights on, you better notice
Hoes cut throat you at work tryna get a promotion
Seen Casper the ghost, run off with the package
Used to run with Michael Myers til that bitch start ratting
I thought I had a bad bitch, I really did like her man
But she was hooked to everybody, she's Spiderman

[Hook]
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
So many niggas wearing masks
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
So many hoes turn nasty
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
You was my nigga dog, what happened?
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween

[Verse 2]
Ain't it funny how money could change a man soft
Money making rich with the bricks, they knocked his ass off
Junior was my pass dog, niggas stole my drawers off
Nigga had a mask on I thought you were my dog, dog
Bitch got my dog fucked up and it's hurting me
Thought she was a saint, the whole time she had HIV
Damn that's a mask you can't take off when it's on ya
Ran with Jason now that nigga a cluckhead on the corner
Come on dog let's be a realist, what happened to the real clique
Half of the niggas I ran with hating on me now, real shit
It's hard to find a real bitch, been hurt one too many times
Bitch say she ain't thinking about my money? Hoe you fucking lying

[Hook]
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
So many niggas wearing masks
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
So many hoes turn nasty
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
You was my nigga dog, what happened?
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
