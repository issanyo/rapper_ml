[Verse 1: Boosie Badazz]
My partner got his chopper and he bent down by that nigga ho
Hit you up and take you out, you better have your pistol out
All we know is murder, fuck the 'Gram, we refuse to talk
Let's go get a goal, we gon' wait on him, knock him off
They beefin' up in my city, they see you, they spittin' fifty
Everything got extensions, all of my niggas with it
My dog done came home, the clique done got strong
The clips done got full, the money done got long
These bitches trailin' the car, these bitches trailin' the car
Boosie droppin' the hits, my clique sellin' the hard
Louisiana in this bitch where they die behind me
Got some Chiraqers in Chiraq who'll ride behind me nigga

[Chorus: Chi Town Tay]
Murder hood, murder hood
Murder hood, murder hood
Murder hood
Everybody 'round here's got murder on they mind
It ain't even safe to walk to the store
Everybody 'round here's got murder on they mind
It ain't even safe to ride with your ho

[Verse 2: Chi Town Tay]
Keep your eyes open wide, it ain't never safe outside
I even used to tote that pistol when I was with the Uber driver
Run un on me when it's on me, nigga that's just suicide
I would do that by my lonely even though my niggas ride
I'd rather pistol play with you before I rap beef with niggas
Pop up on you in your city, nigga when you least expect it
You wanna show off for the internet, I won't have no involvement
Sneaky creepy crawler, I'll stalk your ass and chalk it
It ain't safe outside, not a day go by that I don't hear them sirens
Shit be crazy, man anything can happen at anytime
And that tally in my city, it don't be no fuckin' around
Where niggas see you at, they leave you at, whether sun be up or down
Niggas drop like flies and cross they guys, the shit out here be crazy
If I catch you with that pistol close range, boy you ain't gon' make it
Innocent people that's dead 'cause they identity mistaken
Might not have time to reach under the seat, it's on my lap, off safety

[Chorus: Chi Town Tay]
Murder hood, murder hood
Murder hood, murder hood
Murder hood
Everybody 'round here's got murder on they mind
It ain't even safe to walk to the store
Everybody 'round here's got murder on they mind
It ain't even safe to ride with your ho
