[Hook:]
Graveyards packed
Jail House crowded
Black Rain, Black Rain

Graveyards packed
Jail House crowded
Black Rain, Black Rain

Graveyards packed
Jail House crowded
Black Rain, Black Rain

Graveyards packed
Jail House crowded
Black Rain, Black Rain

[Verse 1:]
They just gave my cousin Bronson
A dime piece
All of a sudden muthafuckas they don blind me
Wish I can walk around the corner and find Bleek
Scoop Fin in my Charger with his nine beam
Remind Sneed that coke ain't what you need homie
Rest in peace to all y'all pussies that was hating on me
I got a head with no screws Boosie you'on listen
I'm on a mission tryna get my fucking blood out prison
Black rain  in Angloa where the thugs roll
Too many members gone that I know
Hoochie, Moo, and Lil Joe
I just did a nickel
Around my way we don't play boy
Extension and AR's
Ivy and my fucking daddy
They in the same graveyard
On god I go hard it ain't no pulling my card
Just looking at me wrong
Bitch, you pushing a bar
They want stripes no money
Doing life no numbers
Hunnid bodies in two months
What we call cold summers , bitch

[Hook:]x4

[Verse 2:]
The rain that I see
The people I meet
I know black rain
I've shed blood for yah
Check out my tat mane 'my nigga name'
The people chase cause we caking (it's like pac-man)
Everybody killing no choice
Go buss ya ass man
We get it in my friend
Young live niggas
This is for my body baggers
Them shy niggas
Shit, I'm riding around with my pistol
These niggas crazy
Police killing muthafukas daily
I got it if off of safety
Lil boy just died in a homicide
He was a by-stander
Not that dude , he was cool
We die random
Too many gone that I grew up with
Prolly would've changed my life if I knew that shit (man)
Blood stains , white sheets
Another smoked teen
Shot him down like he was grown
He was 14
Agents gave BG lil doogy 14
I just lost my nigga pimp to the codeine
