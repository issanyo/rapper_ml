Clear the scene when I pull up with a choppa
Niggas bleed when I pull up with a choppa
Ain't no hand guns niggas tote choppas

[Bridge]
If you rollin wid a choppa nigga don't hesitate to use it
If you rollin wid a choppa you dont squeeze it motherfucker you dead

Got too many shots for me to miss it

[Verse 2 Boosie Badass]
I like to welcome yall to choppa city
One good squeeze kill a block of niggas
I don't slang it, I don't aim it, I just fire nigga
Homicide division call me John Gotti nigga
I got T.I.P guns in my closet nigga
Shoot first talk later them Boosie rules
Got a pass that'll make ya not laugh on sight broad daylight, them Boosie goons
Got a clip in my pocket and I slide it in
Yoppa miss one bet I got his friend
Ridin with that choppa got me sent to the pen
Choppa still was choppin when I went in
You talkin bout sin, that's a noun to me
Got 6 AR's that'll clown for me
You don't want it bitch nigga better bust a move
Last thing you want me to do is fuck with you
Choppas on deck nigga
