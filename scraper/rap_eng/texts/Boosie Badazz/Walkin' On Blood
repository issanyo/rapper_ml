[Intro: Boosie Badazz]
Boosie Badazz nigga
Sonic
Lil Lonnie

[Chorus: Lil Lonnie]
Two thousand for a pair of shoes, nigga I'm walkin' on blood
I'ma keep goin' in 'til I feel like it's enough
I got that real nigga presence, I make your bitch fall in love
I'ma tell it how it is, I swear she can't get enough
This money I can't get enough
These bitches they love me, they can't get enough
These foreigns, these whips, they more than enough
But I'ma keep spending, I can't get enough
Two thousand for a pair of shoes, nigga I'm walkin' on blood
I'ma tell it how it is, I swear she can't get enough

[Verse 1: Lil Lonnie]
I swear she can't get enough
Got her addicted like she is on drugs
She got a nigga but he is a dud
I keep that pussy wet like it's a flood
Dirty money, got this shit out the mud
All this money, I'ma go live it up
I am the lil nigga that they discuss
All that hatin', pussy nigga shut up, yeah
I fuck it up on some Louboutins
They like what are we gon' do with him?
They know this shit is not new to him
They know that check it stay glued to him
These niggas losers but I'm born to win
Fuck it up and get it back again
Bill Plaza and I spent a ten
Dumped a model and went and bought a Benz

[Chorus: Lil Lonnie]
Two thousand for a pair of shoes, nigga I'm walkin' on blood
I'ma keep goin' in 'til I feel like it's enough
I got that real nigga presence, I make your bitch fall in love
I'ma tell it how it is, I swear she can't get enough
This money I can't get enough
These bitches they love me, they can't get enough
These foreigns, these whips, they more than enough
But I'ma keep spending, I can't get enough
Two thousand for a pair of shoes, nigga I'm walkin' on blood
I'ma tell it how it is, I swear she can't get enough

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Got my own potato chips girl, Lousiana hot fire
Got my own liquor too baby, call it Boosie juice fire
I wear my own clothes nigga, I'ma drug house mob
Bitches drink my cum, ooh they just can't get enough
I got a real nigga presence, I don't have to buy 'em no presents
I get in her mind and I show her she prescious
Dope manes, they jump in Giuseppes
2K for a pair of hoes, ooh, I'm walkin' on blood
Two cash to one of my goons, they hittin' you up

[Chorus: Lil Lonnie]
Two thousand for a pair of shoes, nigga I'm walkin' on blood
I'ma keep goin' in 'til I feel like it's enough
I got that real nigga presence, I make your bitch fall in love
I'ma tell it how it is, I swear she can't get enough
This money I can't get enough
These bitches they love me, they can't get enough
These foreigns, these whips, they more than enough
But I'ma keep spending, I can't get enough
Two thousand for a pair of shoes, nigga I'm walkin' on blood
I'ma tell it how it is, I swear she can't get enough
