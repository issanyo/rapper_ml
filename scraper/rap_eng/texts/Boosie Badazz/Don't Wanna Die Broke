Better get yo shit together

[HOOK]
I don't wanna die broke
I remember my nigga Lil Ivy told me
He told me, nigga just don't die broke
I told my Mama when I was 15, I don't wanna die broke Mama
So we gotta get tha money
Fuck it, we ain't dyin' broke

[VERSE 1]
Stackin' up this money, cuz this life a hurricane
You might just leave this cold world tomorrow my nigga
A hurricane
Don't wanna die broke like my father, a hurtin' man
You don't wanna die old and a work man, and a purp man
Can't take it wit' ya, but you can leave it in some hands
Money ain't everythang, but it will ease tha pain
Gotta leave ya kids sumin'
So get ya skrill right, ya biz tight
Gotta leave 'em money, get ya will right
Need a helpin' hand, I know just what it feel like
Refuse to slow my grind, cuz my kids need tha rich life
Never know when you gon' go, so you better get ya shit right
She ain't helpin' you get money, nigga you betta get ya bitch right
Cuz you don't wanna die broke

[HOOK]
I don't wanna die broke
I remember my nigga Lil Ivy told me
He told me, nigga just don't die broke
I told my Mama when I was 15, I don't wanna die broke Mama
So we gotta get tha money
Fuck it, we ain't dyin' broke

[VERSE 2]
Bury me in Hennessy, paid like tha Kennedy's
Let me be a big check, along wit' my memory
You gon' remember me
Know I grind hard cuz I remember those days
Goin' to school really wishin' that I had those J's
Now that's a cold face
When you broke, people got some cold ways
I'm just glad that's the old days
I'm tryna go out like Trump if you ask me
I want my pockets on Trump if they smash me
I wanna see my people shine from up there
So every year gotta be better, money gotta be Hefner
I get big bags nigga, man my pockets they special
If I go broke again, shit I'm bout whatever
Cuz I refuse to die broke, fuck that shit

[HOOK]
I don't wanna die broke
I remember my nigga Lil Ivy told me
He told me, nigga just don't die broke
I told my Mama when I was 15, I don't wanna die broke Mama
So we gotta get tha money
Fuck it, we ain't dyin' broke
