[Verse 1]
We got a dozen of bricks
Godfathers in a stick
Traveling in a trench again (it’s work)
Burglar balls went and panicked

[Hook 1]
Money on my mind
I got tunnel vision
Money in the ground
Money in the city
Coming dollar signs
All a n*gga’s vision
Seeing 20 50 big old blue millions

[Hook 2]
Yeah I got it on me
Yeah I got it on me
Yeah I got it on me

Boy you don’t want it (pussy n*gga)
You better check my rap sheet
Call my cousin donkey
Now I got your kitchen
This is Black Ricky n*gga
And he owe 28
No leg shots no chest shots
Put stick up in your face
Y’all get what I do yet
Call my n*gga ruger
If you don’t think Boosie will shoot you
Better ask the prosecutor
We don’t play games
We come to your spot
Kick down your door
Shut down your shop
Stand over you
Bitch I’m a dog
Kick this bitch all in the mall
I got me the party stop
So off he retarded now
Cross the track
Boy we get it on
Don’t trust nothing
Kinda paranoid
Got it on me boy while you're staring hard
Put this bitch upside your head
N*gga we ride you know you dead

Catch me in traffic with it on me
In the club with it on me
I’ll be my child with it on me
Trying to serve 50 to my auntie
I got a 40 in my undies
I’ll be in the trench ducking undies
I got 20 bags on me
Homie that’s not a lot of money
I kill in these pants and I steal in these pants
Flipping these bitch they ain’t touching my hash
Couple my mascot [?]
They fuck it up I’m gonna shade on their ass
I popped a Molly do not do this stand
Stand up n*gga
They tried to pull over my four and I ran
Look like I just left Iran God damn
Young FA I started from the bottom
Got stuff like that from Baton Rouge
Got cash like that from Harlem
I popped a lot of bottles
And my youngers pop them hollows
This glitzy game bitch
I hope you see the new model boom
