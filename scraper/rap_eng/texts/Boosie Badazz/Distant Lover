Lil' Boosie Badazz
B.J. on the track, nigga, B, you the man for this one

[Chorus]
Wish I could fuck her every day (uh-huh)
Touch her in every way
But she stay so many miles away (mm-mm)

[Verse One]
I'm turnin' into Mr. Telephone Man, girl, you know I miss ya
So many miles away and I can't kiss ya (But look here)
But I remember everything, the concert, the room (the room)
The shit you whispered in my ear when I had you
Now my Jacksonville chick, she an indo shopper
She like to smoke purple (yeah) and chill with her partners
When I come in town, she cook for me
Know she lookin good for me
Momma white, daddy Black, so that ass super fat
My uptown chick (chick), we still be flirting
When I see her, she remind me of how I broke her virgin
Think I still drive her crazy 'cause she still wanna date me
Got a man and a baby, do ya thang, I ain't hatin'
Now my Michigan chick, she was too damn fine (ooooh!)
Her pussy stay wet, all the time
One of the best to ever ride me, let me get a car and drive it
Every time she see Lil Boosie she smilin'

[Chorus]
Wish I could fuck her every day (every day)
Touch her in every way (but look)
But she stay so many miles away (mm-mm)
She my  distant lover, so many miles away
Distant lover, so many miles away
Wish I could fuck her every day (every day)
Touch her in every way
But she stay so many miles away
She my distant lover, so many miles away
Distant lover, so many miles away

[Verse Two]
At night, I'm on that doja just thinkin' 'bout my distant lover
Wishin' I could call her up and go fuck her (telling you!)
But she stay so many miles away and it's hard (hard, mayne)
And if I ain't got no shows, I can't even see my broad
She know a nigga livin' large, so when we fuckin' (fuckin')
Lil' mama give me everything, she ain't scared of nothin' (ah)
She get on top and drop it like it's hot, I'm steady nuttin' (ah)
My distant lover a lil sexy lil somethin', huh, bro, huh, bro
Now my Tampa chick, she 'bout what she be talkin' 'bout
Nasty girl, take it out her ass, put it in her mouth
Knew she was a freak when she got in the backseat
She said she wanted me
And peep, we left her shakin' in the sheets
Now my Georgia peach, ooh, we gon' thug til the end
She don't give a fuck about no lady (nope!)
Or none of my friends (mm-mm)
And when she seen that man, she hug me
Tell me, "Hi," that she wan' fuck me
I had to show her how to suck me, nickname her "Coldblood"

[Chorus]
Wish I could fuck her every day (every day)
Touch her in every way (but look)
But she stay so many miles away
She my distant lover, so many miles away
Distant lover, so many miles away
Wish I could fuck her every day (every day)
Touch her in every way
But she stay so many miles away
She my distant lover, so many miles away
Distant lover, so many miles away
(Real shit, real shit)

[Verse Three]
Girl, I got feelings for you, mayne (I got feelings for you)
I'm on some shit like middle school
I'm tryna write ya letters
Since I can't come home and tickle you
I'll fuck, for what a lil' do (what's one time?)
I need that pussy from you every night (every night)
'cause I know it gon' be wet and right (oooh!)
A candlelight dinner 'cause wit me, you a winner (yeah)
If you wit me, you ridin' Davins, other spinners pretenders
I got redbones in different states, every one got a pretty face
Every one let me grip their waist, every one know I don't play
My thugged out chick, I can't fuck her too often (uh-uh)
She bring problems in my life and she do too much talkin'
But I gotta give it to her, with that mouth she the sickest
If you put work up in her hand, she gon' move it wit the quickest
Now my California chick, she the type you don't need (uh-uh)
She always trippin' on me when I smoke my weed
I told her, "girl, if you don't like it, then you can get to hikin'"
I wasn't trippin' when you told me you was dykin', she my
