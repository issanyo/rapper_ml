The wrong role model
Oh lawd

[VERSE 1]
I got infatuated wit’ tha dope dealers
They life, and they hairstyle
Bandanas and gold teeth
And the women they fuck
Guess I grew up in tha fast lane
Infatuated wit’ tha finer thangs
At tha mall we would window shop
At jewelry and diamond rings
Respect, we salute off top
To tha big dawg who run tha block
From Monday to Sunday
Him and his runners, they run tha shop
Michael Jordan was a muthafucka
But Calvin was GOD to us
Crazy ‘cause we worshipped tha one
Who hurt our family, sell hard to us

[BRIDGE]
Role model
Larry Hoover shit
Rayful Edmond shit
Role model
Pablo shit
Rick Ross shit
But not tha rapper Rick (tha dope dealer)
I wanted to be like tha big dawg in tha hood who gave out tha turkeys out
Shoulda went that way
But I went tha other route
Me, Lil Bleek in front Grandma house
Spray you, u come in front Grandma house
Tryna be our role models
We ate in front my Grandma house
Damn look at my role models
Dead or stuck in prison
Guess when you get too much
They come and they get ya

[HOOK]
I think I had tha wrong role model
Me & U
So I just might be tha wrong role model
For you and you
It’s safe to say
I had tha wrong role model
Oh lawd
So I just might be tha wrong role model
For your child

Talk to ‘em Bad azz
[VERSE 2]
You might want jewelry like me
Get pussy like me
But is you really down to take care all of them children like me
Half my niggas in tha ground
Show you want hittas like me?
Show u wanna live tha life I live
U might not make 23
Fo’ you ever try to be like me
Rather you be 23
Michael Jordan
Cuz my life is for the dangerous and deep
I get blamed for a lot of pain
My life ain’t built for tha weak
Is you gon’ cry when ya nigga die
Or put his killa to sleep
I send a prayer to all tha lil ones
Who grew up livin’ like me
Hope you make it, some way, some how
And go and get it like me
But don’t be slippin’ like me
Be wit’ yo pistol like me
Is u gon’ buss behind yo shit
Sho you won’t be drippin like me
Can you guerilla hustle if you fall
Go get that ticket like me
Camp J, Angola bound
When u get ignorant like me
U want be Boosie
Would you want cancer in yo kidney like me
I was raised to think that sellin’ dope tha only way u get rich
Real shit

[HOOK]
I think I had tha wrong role model
Me & U
So I just might be tha wrong role model
For you and you
It’s safe to say
I had tha wrong role model
Oh lawd
So I just might be tha wrong role model
For your child

[VERSE 3]
Let me take you back
When I was in a daze lookin’
Fo’ I ever got some pussy
If you wasn’t a bad azz
People would thank that you was pussy
All my uncles trained me
Boosie you can’t be no pussy
Showed me how to be a gangsta
And they showed me how to cook it
This tha baking soda (Whip It)
This tha purple so (Sip It)
He’s a jacka, he might wack ya
This is serious
Kill him (I feel him)
Then he went to runnin’ all them gangsta stories
Bout Boo Milton nem
When 2Pac came to tha bottom
And I was feelin’ him
I used to drank tha whole bottom
Silk & Slim was my role models
I went to tha pen
Look what you did
I had tha wrong role model
Black Jesus up out that bottom
Big Rowe always sold me fire
And Big Hammer was a legend to me (Thug in Peace man)

[HOOK]
I think I had tha wrong role model
Me & U
So I just might be tha wrong role model
For you and you
It’s safe to say
I had tha wrong role model
Oh lawd
So I just might be tha wrong role model
For your child
