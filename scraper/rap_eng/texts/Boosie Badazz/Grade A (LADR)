[Verse 1]
Coming up, I wanted a money roll to get an honor roll
Bitches so bad you think about em and they conscience cold
And I’ll take these bitches over 100 hoes
Straight like that, lyrical lord I’m talking shaped like that
Got the body of a goddess with the face to match
Grade A nigga, so great A I track
No C’s and D’s on my team, girl you a tiger

[Hook][x2]
Check out my honor roll, grade A bitches
Grade A, Grade A, Grade A bitches
Check out my honor roll, grade A bitches
Put your hands up if you want grade A bitches

[Verse 2]
Check me out now, red bone slim waist
Pretty face, pretty pussy, grade A
Can’t forget my Harlem chick, the baddest upstate
Perfect ass, but it look fake
Can’t forget my west side bitch out the A
She a realtor nigga, we at the dealership nigga
Got a chick at King of Diamonds, Magic City too
Bad bitches cross the world love Boosie Boo
My LA chick she amar
Dressed so sexy, P’ll make her heart
Perfect eyeliner
H-Town chick, man all she do is wear designer
Got her own shit, she a hustler, she a grinder

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 3]
Own car, own house
Weave perfect, and her ass bounce
Can’t forget my Jamican girl with no stomach
Whole family street ties, she got old money
My Puerto Rican super bad, she got a walk on her
Sexy, sassy, anything, she got a mouth on her
My Memphis girl, lord knows I bet the house on her
I got a Chinese broad, bad as Nicki Minaj
Honor roll, where you at girl?
Catch the wall, look back, make it clap girl
Red bottoms [?] time, me and my boss bitch
You see the shit I got on nigga? She bought this
Chanel, five swag, that’s my snow bunny
Blond hair, blue eyes, that’s a poor bunny
My Cali girl she standing five foot three
She favor Halle Berry and she bad as can be
