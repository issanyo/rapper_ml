Lets not talk about indictments
That shit get frightening
Lets not speak about cocaine
They swapping names
Federal search and seizure
Turn boys into believers
Set up by your people
Young devils and deceivers
You're not my equal

[Verse 1: B Will]
(Daamn) Eddie hit my phone like whats happenin homie
Went to Baton Rouge, niggas ratted on me
Shit get crazy my old lady young attached and lonely
Bitch got full of that powder and she snatched the homie
Lawwd, how much pain can my soul take
Oh what a difference 36 O's make
I hit em up, broke em down
Murders turn to cold case
3am, me or them, them niggas dont sell coke late
Pink dolphins and snowflake
All they do is roleplay
In my heart I just know (I can whip a whole cake)
I saw the whole thing starin through my gold frames
Chain smokin cigarettes ashes on my low mayne
Up the totem pole the rocks that my scrotum hold
Jesus please bless my soul
I press the dope with my left exhale the smoke with my right arm
Don't rat (Don't rat, that that's how niggas die young)

[Verse 2: Lil Boosie]
I hate talking about indictments
But I think its time to speak
5 months til my release these niggas stole my brother Bleek
4 weeks later read the paper faces poppin up (Im hurtin)
Homocide in my cell sayin we gotcha (On 7 murders)
Next day 4 more indictments it was frightenin my heart shakin
4 more drug charges and my old lady made the statement(This is facts)
Took my music froze all my accounts
To bring me pain cry in shame (Like I was dealin cocaine)
That was illegal search and seizure how they went fucked with my shit
Prolly did it cause when they questioned me I told em suck my dick
It ain't stoppin kept goin one year later two more indictments
Bringing syrup in jail ???? Titus
Hard lookin at that chalkboard thinkin am i finished
When your face on top the chalkboard
Under you are your lieutenants
Orange slippers on my feet
Prayin I see some gucci tennis
This shit get hard to mention (So please)
