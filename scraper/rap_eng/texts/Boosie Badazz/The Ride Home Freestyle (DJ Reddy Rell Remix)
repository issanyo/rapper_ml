Man, it’s time to take off these jail clothes
Go get my Boosie fade

[Verse: Lil Boosie]
Man, it’s time to take off these jail clothes
Go get my Boosie fade
Hit through Pleasure Seeker’s
See what’s happenin’ with that new Escalade
Got my weight up with my hate
I’m a hot girl’s dream
Back to doing what I was doing with my money machine
Ching-ching
Label me Scarface, Al Capone and Larry Hoover
You and I know it was damn wrong how they judged Boosie
Lights, camera, action, first time acting and they loved the movie
Finna get my own clothes, I get enough of COOGI
Still with shooters, still be bootin’, but I got my mind right
Now I’m way richer, so what that mean?
I’m way bigger
Shackled down from my feet to my hands
Missing my kids, man a feeling only I can explain
So many people held their nuts, thought I wasn’t gonna come home, huh?
Pay me like I’ll wait, county baby boy home now
