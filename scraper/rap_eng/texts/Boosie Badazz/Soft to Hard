[Big Head:]
I'm the kitchen type
I'm the whipping type
You turn to whipping white
Then grab and whip it right
Get the cake blender, and the cake bowl
Cake mix, baking soda now the cake swole
I'm the bank, don't believe me check my bank roll
Stacks baby! Perfect timing keep it white so it ain't gold
You wanna see some magic? give me the compact
Hot water hit the plastic then it jump back (abra cadabra)
I'm a turn them white pies into nigga pies
Now they hypnotized, and they got bigger eyes
And we got bigger rides, with the bigger tires
On the strip we make grip like grip flies
Matter fact my block hot like french fries
Will I stop? I think not I gotta get mine
I'm the goon doctor give it to me I can fix it
I got a large apetite I need a meal ticket

[Foxx]:
You need a whole thang just text me
That white bitch she sexin me
Let me find a pot let me see that soda
Get the fuck up out the kitchen, you don't like the odor
I'm taught well learn from a soldier
My cousin sold it my uncle smoke it
When I was 12 one day I stole it
Made a couple dollas I couldn't control it
Hustl'n hustl'n
I been cookin and whoopin it
I been duckin and dodgin 'em
It ain't right but I'm pushin it
Judge told me I'm pushin it
Fuck the judge cause I'm pusin it
My lil boy need diapers and my old lady she full of shit
I be on the hot stove where the pots go
Get the scale out, Joe watch the door
I'm Chicken Shack, I'm Popeyes, I'm KFC it's rock and roll
Rollin rock, these patrollin cops
They don't even knock, they come in with Glocks
I'm a pull a Pac, I'm a drop one
Cause a whole brick they'll hang Foxx
That white thang cost nice change
Bout 50k'll get you in the game
You got it soft, I'll make it hard
Get a whole bird for Lebron James
You might say I should be a cafeteria worker
The way I whope over that stove when I'm fulla da purple
