[Hook x2]
Oooooooh
Nigga you in trouble now
Oooooooh
Can't nobody save you now
Oooooooh

[Verse 1]
All black, everythang
This is not a game
This that fufu-fufu-fa, this that fire flame
Itchin' for some attention, so now you entertained
Masked up get it up, how I run it man
All you had to do was chill, mind yo business
But you won't drop in these shoes, these that wrong tennies
Ain't nobody bad, cuz this story have a sad ending
One strike you out, another one don't talk
Oooooooh
You hear that nigga, bloaw feel that nigga
And can't nobody save ya
You in a swamp with gators
We get it in my friend, cuz the streets made us
Got my AK, 2 clips taped together
Talkin' like you ball whatever, but we'll finna see
And you can't run, I could touch ya and a penitentiary
You gonna be a memory
You better run when you hear

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
When we ride, we gon' ride, we gon' show stretchin'
Stalkin' caps in our head, make us look bald headed
When we ride, no survivors, the whole section
2 to the leg, 2 to the chest, then dome check em
Catch him slippin' by his house, we home reckless
Black gloves, no prints, we known veterans
You done dropped in this water, you really need help
You in the water with great whites and killer whales
Oooooooh
These choppas nigga
These stop a nigga
This ain't no kiddie land
Welcome to jigga land
When niggas kidnap and rob niggas like Jigga man
Then watch the bitch in my hand
I ain't gon' stop with it nigga
I'ma eat yo lunch with it nigga
Get the job done with it nigga
I gon' pull the sawnoff, knock his arm off
We got no specific victims, we want all of y'all

[Hook]

[Verse 3: lee banks]
Man whats up wit all these pussy ass twitter gangsters
Thuggin' for the internet
Okay there's beef, I'm with it we can get into that
Computer killers, distance from a distance, kind of shit is that?
Let me load up a choppa and pop up where you little niggas at
Then all yo families where they at, fuck em we gon' splam niggas
Shotty got a half trigger, knock you in the half nigga
Why you with that booting, looking stupid, I just laugh nigga
You can be foolish and get smashed shit I die nigga
Oooooooh
Body bags and caskets
White chalk, yellow tape, cold tables and pastors
No I'm not a actor
And no I'm not just a rapper
You can judge me by the cover,But Iâ€™ll close a nigga chapter
I'm with that, I ain't with the chit chat
I just click clack
I hop on and drive on, like groaw groaw nigga get back
I'ma sit back, until its time to pop up where yo shit at
I'd really push a nigga shit back, oh bitch ass nigga
