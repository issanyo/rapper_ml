Boosie Badazz, B Will
Granny say it's alright to cry

I told Miss Linda, Please stop cryin'
She said, Boosie, they killed three of my sons and my lil son
I ain't gon lie I won't stop cryin'
My granny say, ain't nothin wrong with cryin'
I hope my Linda, she ain't cryin'
She said Boosie, don't let them kill you, I'm prayin' for you baby
I ain't gon lie I won't stop cryin'
My granny say, ain't nothin wrong with cryin'
I send this out Miss Linda, your name put me in my feelings
Your child was my best friend of me, his death almost ended me
They sentenced me, I got to Hunts and I got high about it
Lit up a hump, looked at the kids on my chest, and what I did?
I cried about it
Cried like a motherfucker when my daddy died on the steps of Garfield, where the ghosts walk by
Man, momma say she got a plan, she just don't know the way
Momma say fuck that fame, we goin' section 8
Still she hug and kiss me, let me know that I'm a blessed today
I remember, bills due, water cold, momma tearin' up
The brokeness made the fall foggy and it ain't clearin' up
Cuz my cousin doin' life at 15, no sweet 16, lord
How your grandmother doin, what the old lady asked
Not knowin that my old lady passed, fuck that, I want my old lady back
It was sad lookin at Travon picture in the cell, thinkin' will lil Tudie be safe and well

I clutch my pillow and start cryin'
I wrote a letter to my momma and told her I was sorry, (sorry ma)
I ain't gon lie I felt like crying
Momma say, ain't nothin' wrong with cryin'

People hurtin', people dyin
Prosecutors lyin', chopper shots flyin'
Stay strong, look, I'm tryin'
Right now they cryin'
Thug died and I cried, unsolved murders and framed suicides
Before 17 we all died inside, at 16 I spoke the language of death
Paw paw died on the steps
I speak to my God, but nobody else
You look above but the glow is in self
As a black man, I can't ask for no help
But some nights I cry, for my friends who ain't make it past 15
JJ was a fool, he won't see this dream

I told Miss Linda, Please stop cryin'
She said, Boosie, they killed three of my sons and my lil son
I ain't gon lie I won't stop cryin'
My granny say, ain't nothin wrong with cryin'
I hope my Linda, she ain't cryin'
She said Boosie, don't let them kill you, I'm prayin' for you baby
I ain't gon lie I won't stop cryin'
My granny say, ain't nothin wrong with cryin'

We did plenty crimes friends of mine, yeah we put in work
Lost some friends of mine, kin of mine and I ain't gon lie, it hurt
Asked forgiveness for my sins, so in jail I went to church
Said a prayer when I was gone, that lil donkey dont get murked
My tears'll fill a purse or Chanel bag
You touching them fuckin kids, you should be dead for that
One day she gon start crying, remember everything you did
Overprotected by the time she have a kid
My black people out here crying, can't blame me
They in Charlot bout to riot, they angry
They chained me, calling home to Mookie, now Mookie gone
We holding on, need to call my momma Linda on the phone

I hope she cooking and not crying
She said, Boosie, they killed three of my sons and my lil son
I ain't gon lie I won't stop cryin'
My granny say, ain't nothin wrong with cryin'
I hope my Linda, she ain't cryin'
She said Boosie, don't let them kill you, I'm prayin' for you baby
I ain't gon lie I won't stop cryin'
My granny say, ain't nothin wrong with cryin'


This song gone  make you start crying
If you wanna cry, it's your turn, go and cry
Cuz  ain't nothin' wrong with crying
Ain't nothin' wrong with crying
Granny say, you been holding a lot in, when you gone let it go, grandson?
I was goin thru some things
This song gone  make you start crying
Sometimes you gotta be by yourself to cry, get all alone and start crying
When they told me Bleek was dead I dropped the phone and started crying
I said help me Lord
Started crying
Momma say ain't nothing wrong with crying
