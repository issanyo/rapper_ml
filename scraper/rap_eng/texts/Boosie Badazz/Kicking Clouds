Smoke one for me nigga (Light that shit up out there nigga)
Niggas gotta clear they mind sometime you know cause (sometime)
Be a lot going on (people don't wanna see you happy)
Lot of money (lot of snakes)
Lot of haters (lot of haters)
So I just ease my mind

[Hook]
When I need to clear my mind
Middle finger to your world, if you ain't my kind
And no, I don't really care
I'm in my zone and I just wanna stay there
And I be kicking clouds, clouds, clouds
Fuck em, fuck em, fuck em
Smoking something loud, loud
Fuck em, fuck em, fuck em, fuck em

[Verse 1]
I just like smoking weed (What's wrong with that?)
Feeling fine (What's wrong with that?)
Kicking clouds
Tryna have a lil peace of mind
Always be like fuck my haters
Sometimes I be like fuck the world (That's what I'm like)
Fuck my girl
Light up that real nigga
And I dont really care cuz I'm fine
Hanging out I dont have time
You ain't like my kind
I'm from a rare bloodline
Just roll one for my nigga
May he rest in peace
Rolling up in them Boosie papers
Smoking that Lil B

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Tonight I'm gonna get fucked up with my dogs (Fuck 'em)
Nigga play with us
We gon set it off
And I smoke
Tired of dealing with these bitches up in court
Baby mama threatening me with child support
Now that's some crazy shit
I need a blunt and a cigarette
For this crazy bitch
Me against the world
Stop talking bout me
Me and my girl we girl scouting
Let's take a ride on the high
Smoke that loud with me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And i be kicking clouds (So high)
That real no Bobby Brown (This that shit i get high to)
I smoke presidential (I smoke presidential)
Y'all smoke artificial (So I)
Roll one for my niggas, my niggas (In prison)
Roll one for my niggas, my niggas (We missing)
Roll one for my niggas, my niggas (We getting it)
Roll one for my niggas
Roll one for my niggas, fuck that!
Roll one for my niggas!

[Hook]
