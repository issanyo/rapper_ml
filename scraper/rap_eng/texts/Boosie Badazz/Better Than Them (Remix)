[Hook: SBOE (w/ Rich Homie Quan ad-libs)]
I'm tryna get out the hood, they say they wanna see me win
They wanna see you do good, just never better than them
Me, I put on for my city, do anything just to win
They wanna see you do good, just never better than them
But, me, I'm so better than them, me, I'm so better than them
They wanna see you do good, just never better than them
But me, I'm so better than them, me, I'm so better than them
Me, I'm so better than them, but me, I'm so better than them

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
We hustle better than them, her pussy lil wetter than them
Heard they had work in they house, we pull up and put them Berettas on them
My money longer than theirs, team a lil stronger than theirs
Real niggas fill up the room and I'm smellin' smoke in the air
My watch a lil more expensive, hustle a lil more intensive
Partners a year over twenty and everyday, they ride around wit' extendeds
I cook it better than them, phantom a hundred more bands
This stainless steel on the hood, when I pull up, they know I ain't playin'
We tryna get out the hood, I'm tryna make sure we good
SBOE in that tank and they pull out that drank and they blowin' on good
Up from the hills in LA, we come from that block wit' that yay
North Memphis nigga, we fuckin' wit' Queens and real street niggas just say

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
I pull up straight off the lot, boy I'm so better than them
Trippin' bout bitches, that's nothing, I got bout several of them
442, I got a Cutlass, I put them stripes in the middle
Shawty say she want that pudding, I got nothing but vanilla
I on the low what I paid, I dropped the most since September [?]
Don't ask me what I just ate, eat that pussy like Thanksgiving
Beat that pussy, make her feel it, suck it baby, get to nibblin'
I'm tryna get out the hood, hopin' after that, nigga I'm finished
You can get it, hope that you don't feel rushed
I got a thousand guns plus wit' me, plus Slowbucks, that's my niggas
I sound like I'm in my feelings but I just want you to feel me
And I ain't tryna go back to that livin', whoa, let you know that cuz

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Boosie Badazz]
I represent for my city, I have no problems in them
I ain't just hustle on the street nigga, I slang them yoppers and them
I ain't worried bout nothin' y'all heard bout, you concerned bout what y'all heard bout
Got a thing though, ain't the same though, I hustle smarter than them
I keep that 40 wit' Tim, you [?] don't want see me win
Look in my face wit' a grin, and you want me back in the pen
Like my nigga Meek say. it's levels to this shit
So the bitch you think bad dawg, she ain't even impressin' me nigga
They say they wanna see me win now, and hit the top
But when I went to the pen, half the world forgot
Who dropped the realest shit since Pac, dislike when I used to drop drops
I make yo' salary in one night chump, I hustle smarter than them
