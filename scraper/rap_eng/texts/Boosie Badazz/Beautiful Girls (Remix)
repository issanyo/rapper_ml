[Bridge Intro: Sean Kingston]
Ehh

It's the remix everyone
Everyone it's the remix everyone

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
Hey girl, who you bites off
Guess you dangerous
You got me suicidal
Like angel dust
I, never met a girl like this before (this before)
(You're way too) The way she talk and the way she walk
She make me go crazy
Is it me or is it she
Somebody tell me
I'm talking to myself
Wait, this is not funny
You make me better like Fabolous and you wipe me down like Boosie, let's go!

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You had me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn, all these beautiful girls
They only want to do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Your just too beau-ti-ful girl
Thee number one on my list
You know you are killing me
See these cuts on my wrist
Sike! What I look like?
I am way too busy feeling my self
These cuts are princesses baby
Ain't no way I'm killing myself
If I'm thinking suicide
It must be them phantom doors
Your boy bout bringing toys out
Maybe they should call me Santa Claus
Picture me Cobain-ing, Belushi cocaine-ing
Why would I go blaming or even stoop to go naming
Proclaiming shorty the reason
I'm thinking of trigger sqeezing
I'm cold as winter season
Be cool as autumn breezes
I do what I pleases
Jesus, he just switch women like Regis
Life is so beautiful!

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You had me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn, all these...

[Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
You're just too beautiful (man)
You make me lose control (ooh)
Face like a model (ooh)
Shape like a bottle
Every time I see you I (I)
Just want to be by your side (side)
You make me happy (ooh)
Any then you hurt me, badly
I'm a thug on the street, but a thug got feelings
And I don't want to be hurt (please)
So don't play with me, keep it real with me
And you won't get hurt girl
Went to church, asked God to help me with it
I, I had to holla
Cuz I seen what's in them jeans got Lil Boosie suicidal
I don't know what to do but I know one thing
I wanna lose
I say Sean, I'm so convinced that she the one, I'm confused bruh
But she brighten up my day when I see her (when I see her)
Then she turn right back around and be a cheater
Them sexy lips and them sexy hips
They make me come back
We fight at day and sex at night and
I'm loving that
Them USA girls, them Jamaican girls
They shake that thing the best
They look you in the eyes and take your heart out of your chest, yes

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You had me suicidal, suicidal, suicide
