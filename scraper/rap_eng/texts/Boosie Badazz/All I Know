[Talking]
When you loved like I'm loved
Somebody got to hate ya
It don't surprise me at all cause I'ma street goon

[Hook]
Wake up everyday and hustle my nigga that's all I know
Ain't surprised by you hating my nigga that's all you know
And I'm going lots of places but I ain't going broke
Cause putting money over niggas and bitches that's all I know

[Verse 1]
That's all I know
Don't care what you say about me (nah)
Don't care how you feel about me (nah)
Drag my name through the mug
Guess what? I'm bout to kill these streets
Going places you will never see
Someone you will never be
Mama say get some rest
I might miss a check so I never sleep
Loyalty, Loyalty, Loyalty
Is all I know
Trouble free, you don't want war with me cause war is all I know
Went from the block to hip hop
Bottom to the tip top
I can't go broke I'm too hot
You hating on me cause you not
They hated Jesus so you know they gon hate me cause of my power
Its my time, my grind , my gift, my hour

[Verse 2]
This all I know
I hustle hard
I shine bright
Let all these shoot shooting people stay on their guide-light
Money over niggas and I hate to the dick riding type
Hating people textin' to get a spot in the limelight
Pop them bottles I'ma grind this show
Come back off tour and grind some more
From my heart it ain't none to cut that bitch off
That ain't my ho
Hustle so I don't struggle nigga that's all I know
You in everybody business you bitches that's why you broke
While y'all criticizin' my name, I'm on a camel in Dubai
If they say 'sky's the limit,' guess what, then I'm the sky
Real music, I ain't gotta lie, tears of joy run down my eye
You hatin' a nigga who come from nothin', my nigga I ain't surprised, I

People spreading lies on ya ol' lying ass ho
Misery loves company so hating

Now millions to the ceiling
