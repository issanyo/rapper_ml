Keep them big blue hunnids on me

Came home to a hunnid bands & twin Glocks
Driver said he heard three but it was ten shots
Pussy nigga got my name in the wind now
But im back, im with that bullshit again now

Tired of using [ ? ] watching all my children
Back strap with side armer, like who want it with me
Had a ticket, cash that ticket, nigga go & get it

Playing chest all by myself, i got a stale mate
Diving in that water, hope that you could sail straight
