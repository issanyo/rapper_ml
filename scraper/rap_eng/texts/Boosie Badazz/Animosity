Niggas been hatin' since school, cause I'm a fool
Polo down year round with twenties off the ground
I go to clubs, niggas mug but I don't hear the sound
Them niggas know what line to cross if they wanna get down
Watch who you be 'round. Niggas trying to steal your soul
Nigga broke in my car when I used to give em dough
Talk about me when I pass through, smile when I stop
So I strap down everyday cause I can't die like 2Pac
You niggas want my force out my voice, I know
You niggas want some niggas dead in that 4. Well let's go
My mamma told me bout them niggas. Them niggas ain't your friends
Who saw me stash my shit, you blood hit me again
We supposed to be kin. But your family hurt you too
That dust and that gin got me thinkin of dirt to do
But hatin leads to brokeness and brokeness lead to hopeless
And don't think a nigga don't notice ...your animosity

[Chorus]
What kinda nigga call my mom and tell her her son got shot?
A pussy nigga who need that dick up in his fot box
I got rocks. Lotta niggas don't like that
Like (... ?) I'll be right back. G-Nikes with my night cat
Since starter jackets, I had haters back then
Used to get my name in my fade when I was 8, 9, and 10
And these hoes runnin off, fuckin up my relationships
I done had enough, don't know how much I can take this shit
My baby mamma people against me to the fullest
It's because this fit got me runnin duckin bullets
I know you hate my twenties so I'm a get some more inches
And I'm a get some Ks and have you runnin jumpin fences
I'm lookin in the judge eyes, and he muggin me down
Baton Rouge to red stick. There ain't no love in this town
They hold a grudge in this town, They catchin slugs in this town
And don't think I ain't peepin you, clown
