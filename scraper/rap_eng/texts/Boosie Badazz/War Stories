[Intro]
Andre on the beat
You and I got war stories
Bitch
Ride for you, nigga?
Yes
We got war stories, me and you, man
Me and you, nigga
You don't wanna go there
Nah, nah
Niggas don't want no war
I'll ride with you, I'll die for you
I'll be someone you really need
You don't want no war
I'll ride with you, I'll die for you
Don't fuck around, stop playin'

[Chorus]
Introduce you to these war stories
War stories (War stories), war stories (War stories)
War stories (War stories), nigga
I ride for you in them war stories
War stories (War stories), war stories (War stories)
Man, them war stories (War stories), busta

[Verse 1]
Caught me slippin', shit, me and Kirb and we had to bang it out (Busta)
Thought I was hit, glass from the window all in my fuckin' mouth (Busta)
One month later, all out the window I had to air it out (Haa)
Had to show these niggas I'm 'bout what I be talkin' 'bout
I was just sixteen, I kept a rod all the time
Beefin' with the other side, at midnight, I let it fly (Cha)
All this war behind I, love that boy and I got 'em (Straight up)
I went and got them boys who got 'em, and they out their bottom
Same street lil G hit, I led, you 'posed to follow
Instead of puttin' you on game, shit, them niggas put you on powder
Be no tellin' the ways them people on us every hour
Never sneak a real nigga, you supposed to sneak a coward, nigga

[Chorus]
War stories (War stories), war stories (War stories)
War stories
I ride for you in them war stories
War stories, too many war stories
I ride for you

[Verse 2]
Sixteen I was a GI Joe for the G-I chain, rockin' FUBU
Had a problem with banks, talkin', "That lil' nigga new-new"
Kinda crazy, 'cause my cousin front bangers, that nigga foo-foo
Now my cousin friend said our cousin could get the shit, too
Free Lil' Mook and free my cousin Foo, they both on that river
They war stories ain't got no filters, they some cold-blooded niggas
They say we wasn't 'posed to hit 'em, I say he shouldn't have been with 'em
Say, "I don't know, how you trippin'?", say, "I ain't gon' stop 'til I get 'em"
Fred just got shot, heard his only thought was like, "I'm stuck in the middle"
'Cause Paul is my fuckin' dog and Bobby, that's my nigga
Why he did it? He want attention, he's a sucka-ducka
Couple years later, I caught a murder charge (For who?)
For my baby mama brother

[Chorus]
War stories, war stories
War stories
I ride for you, we got war stories
War stories (War stories), too many war stories (War stories)
I ride for you
Alright, look, war

[Verse 3]
Remember, we got blunted, popped a bottle to that nigga? (War)
Waited 'til he came home, played possum on that nigga (War)
Remember when we had them pineapples, but was scared to throw them bitches? (War)
Do you remember when my main man turned to my main witness?
Damn, huh
War stories
Me and B got war stories
For real
Nigga, like that
Yeah
