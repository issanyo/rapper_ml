[Hook-Baby Soulja]
Watch you know about that, dirty
You can't tell me about that dirty
If you yeen grow up in that dirty
Watch you know about that, dirty
Where them boys smoke dirties
And them crackers out there, dirty
You can't tell me about that, dirty
If yeen grow up in that dirty
Where every house in the hood dirty
You don't know about that dirty
See me, I grew up in that, dirty
You can't tell me about that dirty
If yeen grow up in that, dirty

[Verse 1-Baby Soulja]
Where them boys slang hammers
Babies walkin' round with shitty pampers
The bill due, lights get cut off, you lightin' candles
Can't trust a soul, so ya house gotta have cameras
That's how it is, in that, dirty
Where the police work for us
Yeen got a car, ya catch the bus
I'm from where if they try you, retaliation is a must
I'm from where if you cut that heat on, ya momma fuss
That's what happen in that, dirty
See me, I'm a 90's baby
We don't care bout what you did, nigga we crazy
I'm from where if you hustle, you go a while without bathin'
No food in the house, so ya breakfast the candy lady

[Hook-Baby Soulja]
Watch you know about that, dirty
You can't tell me about that dirty
If you yeen grow up in that dirty
Watch you know about that, dirty
Where them boys smoke dirties
And them crackers out there, dirty
You can't tell me about that, dirty
If yeen grow up in that dirty
Where every house in the hood dirty
You don't know about that, dirty
See me, I grew up in that, dirty
You can't tell me about that dirty
If yeen grow up in that, dirty

[Verse 2-Baby Soulja]
Where you and ya brother wear the same shoes
Neighborhood bad, but ya'll ain't got enough money to move
You drop ya baby pamper money on them dice and lose
Parents ain't round, so ya friend's momma enroll ya in school
Dirty, see I know about that dirty shit
No washer machine in the house, so you gotta wear dirty shit
Niggas get shot in the hood and have surgery
Different cities in ya state, yeen ever heard of it
The dirty all you know is your dirty side
Shit get real in the dirty, niggas certified
Years pass, yeen stepped up, ya still ain't servin' dimes
You been takin' losses, you deserve it now

[Hook-Baby Soulja]
Watch you know about that, dirty
You can't tell me about that dirty
If yeen grow up in that dirty
Watch you know about that, dirty
Where them boys smoke dirties
And them crackers out there, dirty
You can't tell me about that, dirty
If yeen grow up in that dirty
Where every house in the hood dirty
You don't know about that, dirty
See me, I grew up in that, dirty
You can't tell me about that dirty
If yeen grow up in that, dirty

[Verse 3-Boosie Badazz]
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty
With that thirty
I been known to use a thirty in a murder, (Murder)
Dealin' fuckin' churches wit innocent pretty purses
They sons is why they cryin' and they hurtin', (Murder)
The water alaska cold, the same lil ratchet hoes
Everybody fuck the same lil' dirt dawg hoes
We gamble each other, sisters and brothers, (brothers)
Beef wit niggas on the next street, who used to love us
Get the kid, let it rain on a nigga, like I'm Wayne P, (Wayne P)
In the dirt, we sell dope to our aunty
Daddy wasn't around, so the dirty made a soldier
Dedicated to all my soldiers, betta tell em Baby Soulja
