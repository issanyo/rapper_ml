*BOOSIE TALKING*

Grandma always said I was protected
Touched by an angel
For real though
Angels all over me (repeated)

[VERSE 1]
Cancer couldn't kill me
Bullets missed at close range
Prosecutors couldn't get me
They was tellin' hoes name
Fake friends couldn't profit
And they was playin' cold games
Magazines doubted my freedom
Now they lookin' so shame
I was protected
Even when they tried to wet me
Wit' cold rain
FEDS missing me by minutes
When I was sellin' whole thangs
I felt strange
Friends comin' up missin'
While I'm in prison
Stayed strong and carried on
When most rappers, they tried to diss me
Now I get it
I was protected by a power that I really needed
How could I win
Wit' all this sin I was breathing
Somebody had me
Somebody wanted my kids wit' they Daddy
I ain't lying
Somebody ain't want Ty & Ivi crying
I had

[Chorus] Repeat 2x
Angels all over me
Thuggin' and lovin' tha streets
Truckin' and clutchin' tha heat
I'm bussin'
They bussin' at me
Angels all over me
Sick as a dog, and I'm hurtin'
Paranoid smokin' tha purp
On trial, and I'm fighting a murder
Angels all over me

[VERSE 2]
40 Glocks bussin' at me huh
Chopper bullets tryna catch me huh
GOD tellin' me to use a rubber
Even though she sexy huh
Followed my first conscious
Stayed home
Don't hit tha club tonight
Cuz ain't no love tonight
Damn
They killed my thug tonight
Was dark and I couldn't see the light
Still I made it out tha tunnel
Somebody gave me faith before I would blow
But I ain't know
A lot of times tears flooded my eyes
But they ain't drop
A lot of times I wanted to quit all this shit
But I ain't stop
It was a angel on a gangsta
Cuz a gangsta was lost
Keep my pistol
My frame of mind
Even when a gangsta got caught
He was my bullet proof vest
When I took them niggas to war

[Chorus] Repeat 2x
Angels all over me
Thuggin' and lovin' tha streets
Truckin' and clutchin' tha heat
I'm bussin'
They bussin' at me
Angels all over me
Sick as a dog, and I'm hurtin'
Paranoid smokin' tha purp
On trial, and I'm fighting a murder
Angels all over me
