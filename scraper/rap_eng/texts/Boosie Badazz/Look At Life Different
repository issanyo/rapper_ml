[INTRO]
Everybody got a story
When I heard this story

Boosie Bad Azz

[VERSE 1]
He say son
I been here 40 years
Ain't had a visitor since 1987 (damn man)
Ain't had a money order, since my sister passed lil daddy
(You can get some of my food)
Long as I wake up every morning breathing
I'm still happy (Huh bruh)
I lost my Mama soon as I got my time man
(Ya Mama dead too?)
The family blame me for her passing
And I ain't lying man (Aw man)
I lost some fingers way back picking cotton in the field
Say his case was kinda straight
But he done ran through his appeals
I'm almost in tears
Say he don't want no lawyer
Say he wish he had a daughter
Cuz his son heart been cold since 6 years old
Told me when I leave, can I leave my socks & my tennis shoes
Shit even my [?]
Wish I could save ol man

[HOOK 1]
Conversations bring realities
Look at life differently
It make you look at life differently now

Hard times and tragedies
Make you look at life differently

[VERSE 2]
Talkin to this lady at visit
Who was waiting on her son
She say them people at Angola hatin on her son
And she don't play bout her son (I don't play bout my baby)
She say her 4th son got murdered
They killed him downtown
And her oldest on a charge
They saying he killed a boy from downtown
Asked me to pray with her
And asked me can I call Johnnie (Lil Johnnie)
Plus her baby boy who wildin, catchin body after body
The other son, he on the dog food
He lost up in New Orleans man
Imagine what this Mama saw man

[HOOK 2]
I had to thank GOD for Boosie, Boosie, Boosie, Boosie, Boosie
I had to go and roll a Bugle, Bugle, Bugle, Bugle
My head was hurting

When I heard OG story
I had to thank GOD for Boosie, Boosie, Boosie, Boosie, Boosie
(I had to hit my knees, and say thank you GOD)
When that nigga told me
I had to really share a Bugle, Bugle, Bugle
He say he don't want no lawyer man
Lord
