Slidin right up in it slippery when wet
And his diamond always grippin still swhoopin just like a vet

Got him cumin just like a jet
Sound just like drizzy sayin I'm the fuckin best

But I hold ma nigga down no matter what the test
He know I'm a rider never gotta stress
Ain't thinkin bout no nigga cause ma nigga got me best
