[Verse 1]
Man is tryna take of these jail clothes
Go get my boosie fade
Hit Duplessis and see what's happening with that new Escalade
Got my weight up with my heat
On my high girl dream
Back to doing what i was doing with my money machine CHING CHING
Label me scarface, al-capone, and larry hover
You and I know it was damn wrong how they judged Boosie
Lights-camera-action first time acting and they love the movie
Finna get my own clothes, I get enough of coogi
Still a shooter still be bootin
But I got my mind right, now I'm way richer
So what that mean I'm way bigger
[?] from my feet to my hands
Missing my kids, man I'm feeling [?] can explain
So many people LA nuts thought I wouldn't go come home, huh
Pay me like I wait [?] baby boy home now
