[Hook: Young Scooter]
I'm a real nigga, you can see it in my eyes
Badass young nigga, they like "How he still alive?"
Pots and stoves, yeah them pots and stoves
Pots and stoves, pots and stoves
Pots and stoves, yeah them pots and stoves
Remix the dope on them pots and stoves

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Street nigga with 300 thousand worth in gold
Still a dope boy, I get 20 for a show
Stainless steel pots on my stove, my Pyrex explode
It's too much fire to the pot and I can't lose an O
I'm the realest rapper livin' since 2Pac is not alive
And I get caught with a thousand bricks right now and still wouldn't testify
Fork gold, all my pots gold
Dope white, money can't fold
I be in the hood where rappers can't go
Pot check, remix, whip the dope out the bowl

[Hook: Young Scooter]

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Long nights, long flights, pots and stoves
Microwave king, ding, rock and roll
Two years old, pullin' on daddy's leg over the stove
Gave me that look like "Son, chill", and I saw it in his eyes
That grind look, that "Chill nigga while I cook"
Toodle, Mr. Pot and Stove, get your clip, lock and load
Cousin showed me how to cook, showed me how to whip it
Told me cook your own cause half the time your cook stealin'
Apartment buildin' and I'm feelin' like the people close
Get the light and light the dro, damn, knock at the door
That's Wendy, and she a loyal customer
Give her somethin' extra so she can double up
I'm a real ass nigga

[Hook: Young Scooter]

[Verse 3: Quick]
Let's beat the pot before it get hot
No water, I dry cook it
Straight 'bout it, give me 30 minutes
Make a 9 piece look like a [?]
If you real, you don't say you real cause it's automatically gon' show
Sugar cane thing freeze up, I kept a side of that snow
You see it in my eyes and the way that I move
That I really did move that dope
Do your homework, ask [?] about me
They gon' tell you that I live what I spoke
365, bitch I'm ballin'
24/7, like Instagram, I'm logged in
I'm hot, fresh off the pot and I'm high, I'm high
Hooked up with Scooter, surrounded by shooters
40 Glocks and black Rugers
Real gon' always recognize real
I live by the G code
My money, it don't fold no more
I started off with pots and stoves
I'm gone
