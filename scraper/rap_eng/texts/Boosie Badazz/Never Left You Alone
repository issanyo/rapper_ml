Boosie Badazz

[VERSE 1: BOOSIE BADAZZ]
Never left you, never left you
Never lead you wrong
When you needed me
My music helped you and made you strong
Always told you I would blow too
Always kept it real on tha pro tools
When niggas ain't got no friends (put on that Boosie)
I'm tha nigga who they go to
Preach it brother Hatch, I do
Real music en flourished
Doctor couldn't help her
My music got her through surgery
(Now that's deep)
You ain't on a nigga yet, then you sleep
Or you just hatin'
Music played when I was gone
Like I wasn't incarcerated
I'm that muthafucka (Badazz)
A legend who always gave his best to you
Tell it like it is muthafucka keep it real
When they tell it like it is I'm tha best to do it
Bankroll, I got a check for you
When yo nigga died
I was tellin' you bout my nigga "I"
Remember, I was there for you

When you needed that real music

[HOOK]
I never left you alone [REPEATED]

AD LIBS

I was there for you
I was there for you

[VERSE 2 : HURRICANE CHRIS]
When you needed somewhere to stay 'cause tha people got too hot on yo block and u had a warrant, I held you down
Where tha fuck did tha love go
Let's be short and simple, like a snub nose
Thru tha thick and thin
I was there nigga
And I spoke on it, 'cause I care nigga
When them shots rang and that smoke cleared
I was still standing like
I'm tryna focus on livin' my life
Fuck all this negative shit
Bitch my earlobes are rocky
My neck full of ice
I'm bout to put dick in yo bitch
Out and sell you a bird, but I know we ain't right
Them niggas be snitchin' and shit
44 desert eagle and knock all tha back out yo back when I empty tha clip
Bitch I been on my shit

[BOOSIE]
When you needed that real music

[HOOK]
I never left you alone [REPEATED]

AD LIBS

I was there for you
I was there for you

[VERSE 2: BOOSIE BADAZZ]
When it was you, Mike, and D
Swisher Sweets and Ol E
When you first jumped off tha porch
Boy you was listenin' to me
Find a 50 then I'm pussy
Was a vision showin' niggas
No pre-nup, he ain't listen
100 mil I told niggas
When you felt like everybody betrayed you
I had a song for ya
Single mothers, when they [?]
I had a song for ya
Mama always workin'
His daddy he never see
So from 13 to 23, he had me
I never left him
Made tha never special
Feel very special
I was there
Told you everything I been through and mo'
'Cause I care
Like tha loud, you ever need a real nigga
He on call
He say he love me
'Cause I never let him down
