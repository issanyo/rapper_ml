[Intro]
Yeah - we finna set it off in this motherfucker, ya heard me
I'm finna put you bitch ass niggas in the trash can with this one
I'm tired of all you bitch ass niggas, y'all annoyin me right now - fuh real nigga

[Chorus]
You wanna talk shit?, you wanna run ya mouth?
You want some gangsta's front yo motherfuckin house?
We'll set this bitch off, yeah set this bitch off
We'll set this bitch off, set this bitch off

[Verse 1]
They call me Bad Azz, and I'll punish you
You ain't my equal, we ain't people - I ain't one of you
Since '98 I grabbed my plate up off the lunch table
I told momma I'm thuggin outside, we don't need cable
Now I'm the nipples on the titty, I'm the motor called a "Hemi"
I'm the V-12 in that 760, you niggas bitches
We real niggas with G-codes
We love to go in beast mode
We thuggin, we all got bread so if we fall we the crutches
We the do'do in the dutches
I'm the photo in the camera, I'm the pistol when it snap ya
I got the sickest Beamer - I got the sickest Magnum
I got the sickest Charger - y'all's thirty mines forty
I told you niggas Webbie and Me, for you get stretched in the streets
This the day that you gon'be deceased, for playin with a beast
I told Turk take off my collar I'm finna take it there
You niggas ain't play at my projects, y'all played at the fair
Trill Entertainment that's my thugs there - there's love there
D.A. don't search my house cause ain't no motherfuckin drugs there
We smart with this shit, we got retarded with this shit
Duece, duece up in my shoe I set it off up in this bitch, nigga

[Chorus]
Set it off in this motherfucker, set it off
My clique all dogs, bitch don't make us set it off
Set it off in this motherfucker, set it off
My clique all dogs, bitch don't make us set it off
Set it off in this motherfucker, set it off
You jumpin'like a frog we'll put you on that wall
Set it off in this motherfucker, set it off
My clique all dogs, bitch don't make us set it off

[Verse 2 - Boosie]
Mayne I be thuggin, I be fresh, I be super clean
With gucci shades, with some J's you ain't never seen
The race car jacket with about 80 fuckin patches
With the car to match it, Tony Stewart it's a classic
Y'all penny pinchin nigga - we spendin on y'all niggas
Call Savage from the back, come pour some Henny on these niggas
Mayne you don't wanna fuck with me
I learned from the streets, I roll with my heat
Never turn on peeps - cause I'm gutta
Came out my momma a hustla
Been through the rain and the pain now I'm a dirty motherfucker
I'll hurt a motherfucker, set it off in this bitch
Y'all niggas coughin in this bitch, we flossin in this bitch
And I walk real well, fuck goin to jail
Come home and set it off and get ya mail, nigga
I got a mind full of evil thoughts
Don't get ya people caught, by my people house - cause believe me I'm a set it off, bitch

[Chorus]
Set it off in this motherfucker, set it off
My clique all dogs, bitch don't make us set it off
Set it off in this motherfucker, set it off
My clique all dogs, bitch don't make us set it off
Set it off in this motherfucker, set it off
You jumpin'like a frog we'll put you on that wall
Set it off in this motherfucker, set it off
My clique all dogs, bitch don't make us set it off

[Verse 3]
Oh you bucked up and fucked up and you ain't got no mind
Don't even respect ya elders, no you ain't respectin mine
But I'm gon'hit you with that 9, put some sense in ya nigga
Shoulda put somethin on yo'ass when you was a lil'nigga
But you wanna play with the real niggas, we'll set it off
Bitch you scared to let it off plus ya daddy wasn't no dog
Ya momma had more heart then ya daddy bitch ass
He ain't gon'set nothin off that's who made you soft
Bitch you wanna come in that south, where it get dumb in that drought
Where niggas wild out like O-Dog and run in yo house
And runnin' yo mouth, it's crucial watch what you say 'bout Boosie
Cause Boosie tote uzi's and his hit man foolish
I ain't never had shit, but I can fuck a bad bitch
Quicker then you can count to 6, (1-2-3-4-5-6) she hit
I don't play, I lay laws you my size I break jaws
I get disrespected at all, I set it off niggaaaa

[Chorus]
I set it off in this motherfucker
Don't make me let it off in this motherfucker
And you gon' respect a dog up in this motherfucker
Cause I'll set it off, set it off
I set it off in this motherfucker
Don't make me let it off in this motherfucker
And you gon' respect a dog up in this motherfucker
Cause I'll set it off, set it off

[Outro]
This Boosie, Bad Azz nigga, and it ain't no game with me
Ya heard me, aye nigga ain't nobody fuckin with me out here - ya heard me
I'm comin sick straight from the heart everytime
Knah'im'sayin I hit the streets, knah'im'sayin I touch you from everywhere
You can put this bitch in and ride out
Every song it ain't no game with me nigga
And if you don't like me and you a lame, we'll go on set it off then nigga
