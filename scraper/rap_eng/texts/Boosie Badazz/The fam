[Lil Boosie]
I just wanna show the world that I really do this shit
That I really make quality street music (know what I'm talking about)
And it ain't no mistake that I'm this good
I just done seen a lot (know what I'm talking about)

We gon' show the world, the definition of real shit
My brotha you gotta feel it lil hustla
We gon' show the world, the definition of real shit
My nigga you gotta feel it lil nigga

I got my own voice (blessed), sing my own hooks (blessed)
Fresh fade nice smile I got my own looks (fresh)
I just like to make people happy (forreal)
Four kids I just like being a good daddy (best daddy)
But I'm a gangster and I rock shows (you ain't seen my shows)
A people person, so you know Lil Boosie got hoes
Damn hoes that's a figure of speech
Get a lot of shit like that when you listen to me
As for my fans, I love y'all straight up
Y'all apart of me so when they hate, they hate us
Money keep a nigga going the better things (house)
Mane I take it to the bank I don't make it rain (boss)
But I'm fly like Weezy (waddup Weezy) plus the hood niggas
Mane they believe me like Jeezy (waddup Jeezy)
And I just like to have a good time hit the yo
Smoke one, and put my life in my rhymes

[Chorus]
We gon' show the world, the definition of real shit
My brotha you gotta feel it lil hustla
We gon' show the world, the definition of real shit
My nigga you gotta feel it lil nigga

[Lil Boosie]
Father forgive me I was raised on some real shit
So I can't sugar coat shit not a lil bit
Inside I'm sad about my daddy
Since I lost my grams I ain't been given a damn
But I still hold my head high and sometime I cry
But when I cry man I don't know why
I feel trapped to be a superstar (forreal)
A hundred thousand worth of jewelry to end it
And I spend it with no problem
You don't like badass then that's your problem M.O.B
Wouldn't give a damn if their hoes holla
Love cars, love broads with a passion
I ain't ever had shit so I'm flashin (do yo thing)
I work hard go and get it on the road seven months
Runnin seven-fifty off for shows get it
I'm hood rich, still smoking that good shit
Still got the same hood clique straight up

[Chorus]
We gon' show the world, the definition of real shit
My brotha you gotta feel it lil hustla
We gon' show the world, the definition of real shit
My nigga you gotta feel it lil nigga

[Webbie]
I told my teacher to her eyes I'ma make it there
She ain't even looked surprised gave me
Another F or a fucking D happy you got a C
Fuck the world lately, be whatever you wanna be
Ain't nothing like a strong mind
And some confidence whenever you step out of line
It's a consequence we all overseas, we puffin weed
We'll make you niggas bleed yes in fucking deed
Seven fourty-seven yelling seven fourty-seven
On the real we gotta be a couple miles from heaven
The world tried to pull us down but we ain't fuckin let it
I would have did some of it different but I don't regret it
That's one thing about me though I never been a quitter
That seizure shit crazy, shout out to the hospital
Rest in peace ma I'ma be on TV (watch)
Young Savage, Sweet Jones, Trill Family

[Chorus]
We gon' show the world, the definition of real shit
My brotha you gotta feel it lil hustla
We gon' show the world, the definition of real shit
My nigga you gotta feel it lil nigga
