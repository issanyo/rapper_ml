It comes a point in a man's life where...
He just gotta get it done
And right now my nigga, I gotta get it done

I gotta get my momma out the hood
Make sure that my kid is living good

Good Lord I'm blessed to breathe and glad to see another day

[Verse 2: Bossie Badazz]
Now if daddy don't hustle then his child don't eat
If my child don't eat then daddy can't sleep
I got no time to sit around see what that mama gon' do
She been playin' games from the start, what the fuck she gon' do
My mama too she been trippin'
At least she don't wan' leave me
I thought you hated this city
But this city got pretty
[?] show for show I go get it
Bring it back to the fans
I never asked for this hustle
So I thank God who I am
I hustle it come back
I get on the stage, they pay me, I run that
No shirt with the [?]
Flickin' up with the big stack
Nigga call with a bag, I'ma get that
[?] money
'Cause my kids are spoiled and I hate to tell them no so when I hustle, ain't shit funny
I got my mama out the hood
But I couldn't get all my potnas out the hood
Most was lost and misunderstood
Most got caught and stuck in [?]
I'm sorry lil' homie but I gotta go
If anybody comin' back to get you
I'm comin' back
You already know and that's on the [?]

[Chorus: T-Rell]
I gotta get my momma out the hood
Make sure that my kid is living good
I got to, I got to
I gotta get this hustle off the ground, 'cause these bills is gonna stress a nigga out
I got to, I got to

I gotta get my momma out the hood
Make sure that my kid is living good
I got to, I got to
I gotta get this hustle off the ground, 'cause these bills is gonna stress a nigga out
I got to, I got to
