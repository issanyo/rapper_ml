Uh huh Lil Boosie look at its me gangsta
Ima do some shit some real shit
[Hook - Boosie]
I been goin thru some things
And don't nobody understand me mayne - I wan'ride candy mayne
I been goin thru some things
Hopin my niggas stay the same, but they always change
I been goin thru some things

[Verse 1 - Boosie]
I been goin thru some shit, from my niggas - to my bitch
And these niggas wanna snitch (why)
I wanna get rich, but sometimes I don't believe
Tryna sell a hundred - thousand but they burnin my cd's (that's fucked up)
Niggas and bitches please won't you give me help
Get yo ass off that computer and buy the shit up off the shelf
Cause I wanna ride candy mayne just like the others
Sometimes I wish I should've took the good route like my brother
These niggas say they love ya but they steal ya dope
Call you up back like that and try an steal ya hope, I still cope
And these niggas wanna rap about you
Know you a solider, but they still wan'bring that savage out you, to get exposed
And these hoes they for the money, tell yo old lady dirty lies but they know they frontin
Check this out in Baton Rouge it's real wicked
And you can't go platinum down here cause this ain't New York City
And all my cousins doin time, thuggin in the Penn
I'm thinkin bout 'em everytime I take a sip of Henn
And I ain't gon'lie I don't wanna be like Camoflauge
I met him one week, next week he died - I almost cryed
Damn

[Verse 2 - Boosie]
Stay hatin cause I'm V.I.P
Ride thru my city with my hat bent like T.I.P
I'm all G, they got alot of niggas signin deals
But they can't talk what I be talkin cause I spit the real
Till I get killed, and these niggas changin like the weather
Think he ya nigga but you lookin at the fuckin devil
Who want ya bezzle and that voice that he wish he had
Jealousy got niggas creepin, down to bust yo ass
We livin fast but you know this how it gotta be
Money, cars, clothes, and hoes till they pop at B
This for my niggas down in Texas on them fuckin swangas
Who got the whole other side of town wantin to stank e'm
And Lil' Boosie mayne I been stressin cause the shit I did (what I did)
Not wearin a rubber got me stuck now with three kids
This shit is real - wish I had a real friend to holla
They tend to laugh when I tell 'em bout my fuckin problems
But I be stackin the fetti, so momma straight when I'm gone
I been prayin for Webbie - cause Webbie wild with that chrome (damn)

And don't nobody understand me mayne - I wan'ride candy mayne
I been goin thru some things
Hopin my niggas stay the same, but they always change
(I been goin thru some things)

[Verse 3 - Boosie]
I'm sippin gallons, tryna ease the pain (leanin)
Hopin my niggas keep it gutta, but they seem to change
That's why I'm solo, blowin do - do in a different city
Thinkin these niggas tryna do me but they rollin with me
My ho the sickest, but she listen to what the streets say
That got me stressin cause she might be leavin any day
I tryed to pray but when I holla he ain't holla back
That's why I'm missin prayers daily tryna get these stacks (why that)
Cause the situation that I'm in
The judge tryna send me to the Penn and give me ten - and do me in
Got me stressin on some major shit
My momma agin and my grandma and my baby sick
This hatin shit, got me one step away from clickin
These me against the world livin'got all my people bitchin
I looked my momma in her eyes, told her respect the game
She like "Boosie leave it alone, look you playin games" (dang)

[Outro:]
That's real life right there nigga
You go through so much
You know what I'm sayin'
Nigga be thinkin' nigga be ballin'
But a nigga be strugglin' at the same time
Why they ballin' you know what I'm sayin'
And I been goin' through some thangs
And don't nobody understand me man

And don't nobody understand me man
I want rock candy man
But don't nobody understand me man
I want rock candy man
But don't nobody understand me man
