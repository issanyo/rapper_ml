I’m ready to learn
Yes, I’m ready to learn
To fall in love, to fall in love
To fall in love with you

Is you ready?
It’s ‘bout that time, is you ready?
One question, Is you ready?
To fall in love

You say you ready, well here we go
You the one and everybody know
We ain’t keepin' quiet, we ain’t on the low
They know you belong to me, yeah

White sand on your feet, yeah
The type of shit that you might find
When you’re in love with me, so let's fall in love

And we still, still gettin' money and we makin' more
On fire, this shit's fire, already know, yeah
You can have the hoes
You so stupid, you can have the hoes
Still gettin' money and we makin' more
This shit's fire, already know
You can have the hoes
You so stupid, you can have the hoes

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
My girl, she my nigga though
Real love, only Mary know
When we at the crib, she put on a show
So home is where I wanna be, yeah
It's like you accustomed
Your body was tailored for me, yeah
Tell me how I'm gon' say I'm the king i
If I ain't got no queen, gotta fall in love

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]

[Verse 3: Boosie Badazz]
(Boosie Badazz)
Soft skin on her body, body
Kissin' her friend on her molly, molly
I touch her, she like it, I tell her suck it, don't bite it
I keep her fire ignited, all our haters don't like it, we ball
Any time you want this feelin' baby, call
I want you, that's all, let me touch you
You can hit the block with me, you can hit the yacht with me
It's obvious you don't stop with me, Boosie

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Is you ready?
It’s ‘bout that time, is you ready?
One question, Is you ready?
To fall in love

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
And we still, still gettin' money and we makin' more
On fire, this shit's fire, already know, yeah
You can have the hoes
You so stupid, you can have the hoes
Still gettin' money and we makin' more
This shit's fire, already know
You can have the hoes
You so stupid, you can have the hoes
