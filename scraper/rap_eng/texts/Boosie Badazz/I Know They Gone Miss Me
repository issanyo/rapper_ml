[Intro]
We all got to die
You got to understand that, son
We all got to die
Look

[Verse 1]
What if I died today?
Couldn’t go home, tell my kids how much I love ‘em
Ooh, they would cry for days
If I couldn’t go home, kiss and hug my mother
And tell her goodbye T lady (I’ll be right back, ma)
What if my daughter needed a hug but I couldn’t hug her
‘Cause a nigga made her cry for days
No smiley face, but I’m gone
When I’m gone, they’ll take my shine away (what they gon’ say about me in the news?)
Never mention my good deeds, probably lie
‘Cause they couldn’t say them lies to my face
I know my uncles gon’ miss me, yay yay
My auntie gon’ kiss me, everyday
I’ll never be history ‘cause the legend has been made
When I’m gone, it gon’ be a sad day, for my family, a bad day
When I’m gone, rewind this song and press play
‘Cause I know they gone miss me

[Hook]
I know, I know, I know, they gone miss me, yay (my momma)
I know they gone miss me (my kids)
I know they gone miss me, yay
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know they gone miss me, yay (all my fans)
I know they gone miss me
I know they gone miss me, yay

[Verse 2]
Even when I’m gone away (when I’m gone away)
Probably say I’m on the same level as Pac
Now that’s some strong words to say (for real though)
I’m talking fans who been my fans since they was virgins
They gon’ cry tears for Boosie Boo, that’s for certain
I know some real niggas who gon’ have to grab a napkin
Nothing but bad bitches at my funeral
They gon’ miss my heart, that’s beautiful, something you don’t know
Now I’m watching from the sky as my niece cry
When losing me, it’s hard to say that he at peace now (damn)
Look how my daughters crying (damn)
My son shedding real tears for a real pops
Got me all on t-shirts, walls in the project
The pain my family feel deeper than an old soul
And man, my niggas gonna miss their boss
I gone, now that’s seven kids with three and a half hearts who miss me
Talk that shit, but I know one thing

[Hook]
