[INTRO: BOOSIE TALKING]

I love to see my lil' brother  run that football
Remind me of me
Hard
Strong
Confident
Never Scared

[HOOK]
No surrender
No retreat
We don't retreat from anyone
In the Penitentiary (In tha Pen)
Or the streets (Or the streets)
No surrender
No retreat
We not scared of anyone
In the Penitentiary (In tha Pen)
Or the streets (I won't surrender)
No surrender

[VERSE 1]
Never will I back down from anyone
It's consequences when you jump my fences
Semi-guns
Playground was plenty fun
But losing made me pissed off
In tha streets I was a G
And I preached, like I'm Young Dolphin
Jail I was a hard head
Fuck what tha guard said
Actavis pints by my bed
Just like tha free world
Rappin' got me paid
But I played off in tha G world
Shoot outs in tha day
And at night I slept wit' 3 girls
Beefin' wit' niggas 10 years older
These niggas tryin' me
Tha city might be scared of you niggas
But Ima dyin' breed
Never ran
Right 'cross tha track if you want drama
No surrender
No retreat
That's on my Mama

[HOOK]
No surrender
No retreat
We don't retreat from anyone
In the Penitentiary (In tha Pen)
Or the streets (Or the streets)
No surrender
No retreat
We not scared of anyone
In the Penitentiary (In tha Pen)
Or the streets (I won't surrender)
No surrender

[VERSE 2]
From tha basketball court to tha football field
All that
Where I became a dog at
A fighter what you call that
Call my call, I call back
I never run from a soul
My Auntie say I had a chief heart
Since I was 1 years old
I used to follow all tha older boys
Jumpin' off tha monkey bars
Whoever thought I'd jump in monkey suits
Wit' a 100 rod
On tha streets I was a Boss
Sumin' sick on these niggas
In jail, I sold drugs, had fights
And threw shit on these niggas
No collar potna, I was born like a pit on these niggas
I believe in we all bleed tha same
Ain't no bitch in me boy
I took my lick
Suck my dick look when they sentenced me boy
I been in street wars wit' plenty beef boy

[HOOK]
No surrender
No retreat
We don't retreat from anyone
In the Penitentiary (In tha Pen)
Or the streets (Or the streets)
No surrender
No retreat
We not scared of anyone
In the Penitentiary (In tha Pen)
Or the streets (I won't surrender)
No surrender
