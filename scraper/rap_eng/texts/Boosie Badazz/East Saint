The look on my face like what you wanna do nigga
Keep me a K and I'll for sure shoot nigga

Ride through the city with a dirty stick
Every nigga 'round me, they 'bout murdering

Three clips, no mercy, it's a bloodbath
Pocket full of money, me and Twin 'nem
They ask me what to do about the hate

Shot him in his neck two times, in his vertebrae
I told a pussy nigga not to play

Get a nigga killed, right hand on the bible

[Verse 3]
You a stupid nigga, you a goofy nigga
Talkin' bad on my crew, we'll lose it nigga
Ayy Boo, what it do my nigga?

Time to put in a little bit of overtime
Ask Boo, young niggas done spent the dime
Six months goin' in, we on the grind
While the day ones left they ass behind
Baton Rouge, Baton Rouge, Baton Rouge
East Saint Louis, East Saint Louis, East Saint Louis
Where them shooters at, we gon' make a movie
I'm a Badazz boy like Boosie (Twinzo nigga)
With my four-five, with my Glock nine
I ain't wasting no bullets, count all mine
They hatin' in my city so I do it for my city
Word around the town we the youngest niggas gettin' it
