[Verse 1]
You know I ain't scared, pistol play the only way I play it
Catch me in the back just like some pads
With 2 Glocks with extended clips, look like a pair of legs
Talk about it, bitch, I'm tryna catch a head, look
I'm off my top, I'm out my skin, I'm finna shed
Got 50 in this clip, you and your niggas, y'all can share it
Your bitch gon' let me rip, gon' let me tear
Plus she gave me head
She love to pull my hair, she hurt my head
She asked me for some shoes, I brought her gas
She asked me what's my name, I i told her Greg
She say [?], I told her yeah
Oh, that's the reason why my dude scared
That nigga the sickest, that nigga [?] with the [?]
Cut up bustin', cut a nigga leg
Leave a nigga sleep like fuck a bed
Wet his body up and touch his head
You know I'm [?], lookin' like a cat
Her old man funny, call that nigga Ted

Fuck that pussy nigga, man, that pussy nigga dead

Everybody 'round me they ready, they on go-mode
Rip your block, have your arm hangin' like a yoyo
It rain blood showers from my block to yours
Buckin' in that ride'll get you chopped and murked
Rip you with this chopper like Boosie been rippin' verses
Fried you and yo' boy, a 2-piece at the Church's
You know I ain't scared, I ain't never been a pussy
Half a million on your head, have everybody lookin'
Boosie got everybody lookin', Boosie got everybody lookin'
Put some bread on your head, have everybody lookin'
Send my nigga round the corner, he think everybody pussy
He ain't scared, bust your head, man, with everybody lookin'

You know I ain't scared, pistol play the only way I play it
Fuck that nigga, bust that nigga head
