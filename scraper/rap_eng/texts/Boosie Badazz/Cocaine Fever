[Intro/Hook]
He got you too
Cocaine Fever (x2), I'm A.D.H.D. I don't listen up
Cocaine Fever (x2), ya mom and dad prolly tried it before
Cocaine Fever (x2)

[Verse 1]
I'm a fuckin' 80s baby, so really I get it
My cousin pushed the weight, while my family smoked the crack rock
Heard mention my heart when my favorite uncle smoked the crack rock
Now his super bowl ring gone for the crack rock
Daddy never comin' home, mayne that shit strong
You ever smelt a dirty dirty, mayne that shit strong
Have ya head twisted when that shit hit ya home
Sister sellin' pussy cause she can't leave it 'lone
I'm from a family tree of hustlers, playas, felons and fiends
When they tell ya that you can't get rich, it's just a dream
Well here it is nigga, nobody believin' in they self
Here it is nigga, you know what that is

[Hook]
Cocaine Fever (x2), my daddy was a dealer what is you talkin' about
Cocaine Fever (x2), you got it too
Cocaine Fever (x2), I'm A.D.H.D. I don't listen up
Cocaine Fever

[Verse 2]
Damn that girl crazy, (yup) that's that coke up in her blood (yup)
Her momma used to pop all them pills wit her daddy in the club
Damn that lil boy don't pay attention, shit his daddy was the plug
He been havin' eyes on him since a cub, coke affectin' him
Look at Bobby cocky, bobby you done got slim (damn bobby)
Them hoes gettin' turnt out, pimps done lost money (damn hoe)
I ain't nun but nine or ten, but I know what it is (what it is)
I just found a crack pipe and I know it's his
In 1997, ('97) they had a rapper out New Orleans
Used to talk about snortin' dope (snortin' coke)
He dropped that Chopper City and every youngster from Baton Rouge to that city, they was snortin' coke

[Hook]
Cocaine Fever (x2), Free B.G., Free B.G
Cocaine Fever (x2), you addicted can't stop sellin' dope
Cocaine Fever (x2), I'm A.D.H.D. I don't listen up
Cocaine Fever (x2), you addicted can't stop sellin' dope

[Verse 3]
First the coke was high, then the rich got treated
Turnt it into crack, and the prices got cheaper
Frames got small and our brains got weaker
The money off the crack made us kill our own people
I did the same thing, I used to serve my own people
Never in my head that I murked my own people
Niggas tryna eat, hustle coke like its legal
2005 was live, Jeezy heated up the fever
Now Boosie got the fever now

[Outro]
Cocaine Fever
