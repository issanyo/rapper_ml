[Intro: Lil Boosie]
When you ain't loyal it come back to haunt you for real
Wish you was loyal now
Turn me up, turn me up
Wish you was loyal now

[Hook: Lil Boosie]
Girl you weren't loyal to me
Your girls, they told you, do you
Girl you weren't loyal to me
Now you wish you was loyal

[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
From the jump you was fucked up
From the jump you was fucked up, I was blind though
Man I never should of loved her
Man I never should of trust her, she was fine though
I'm gonna let 'em know it's certain shit
Treat a nigga like a real nigga, treat his side ho
I had lil dough, he had big dough
Big dough'll make an unloyal bitch though
Bitch had me hypnotized cause she fucked up
Bitch always gotta go, what the fuck for?
Always with her friends but they freaky
Sneaking and you're geeking with your cheating ass
Year passed and you called, I ain't home
Sitting on that check and you sitting broke at home
Head hurting cause your bill due on your phone
While I'm sitting on mils and I'm sitting on the throne

[Hook: Lil Boosie]
Girl you weren't loyal to me
Your girls, they told you, do you
Girl you weren't loyal to me
Now you wish you was loyal
Girl you weren't loyal to me
No, you weren't loyal to me
Girl you weren't loyal to me
No, you wish you was loyal now

Girl you weren't loyal to me
Now you wish you was loyal
Girl you weren't loyal to me
No, you weren't loyal to me
Girl you weren't loyal to me
No, you wish you was loyal now

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Thought you were running but you ain't stand out till the end
Thought you would stay down but never down in the pen
This time you were broke, you couldn't even afford a pen
I was down 15 months, that ain't shit
I smoked 15 blunts, get lit
I fucked 15 hoes, get it in
Boosie Badazz, Rich Homie, we out of here again, again, again
Bitches ain't shit, they ain't loyal
They'll fuck you and fuck your partner
Then they might act like they ain't know about it
Try to play stupid
I'll bust a nigga in the face like Cupid
I ain't talking valentine nigga
Fuck the bitch, no valentine nigga
Swear to hell, Albert Einstein nigga
21 primetime nigga, baby don't lie to me

[Hook: Lil Boosie]
Girl you weren't loyal to me
Your girls, they told you, do you
Girl you weren't loyal to me
Now you wish you was loyal
Girl you weren't loyal to me
No, you weren't loyal to me
Girl you weren't loyal to me
No, you wish you was loyal now
Your friends, they told you do you
Girl you weren't loyal to me
Now you wish you was loyal
Girl you weren't loyal to me
No, you weren't loyal to me
Girl you weren't loyal to me
No, you wish you was loyal now

[Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
Remember (?) in the park (?) mama
Getting fixed food by your mama
Now your mama looking at the BET awards
Like "that supposed to be my son in law"
Look like karma coming back to get you
Heard you got a nigga and he hit you
Heard you got a nigga and he broke though
And you ain't got no job, you a broke ho
Girl you weren't loyal to me
I ain't know, back then I ain't know though
I must have been tripping off the dodo
I thought we was Dorothy and Todo
Looking through the flicks and I ran 'cross a photo
Me in my Levi's you in the Polo
Back then you ain't think it'd end up like this, huh?
Me in the G5, you on the bus though
She got the running out of lies like Johnny Test
Always got to leave when it's time to stay
Shit ain't the same when it's time to leave
Even turn her nose up when I try to play
Back then I was lost tryna find a way
Hitting up a line tryna find my pay
When I need a ride or die she would ride away
Girl you know what I'm tryna say

[Hook: Lil Boosie]
Girl you weren't loyal to me
Your girls, they told you, do you
Girl you weren't loyal to me
Now you wish you was loyal
Girl you weren't loyal to me
No, you weren't loyal to me
Girl you weren't loyal to me
No, you wish you was loyal now
Your friends, they told you do you
Girl you weren't loyal to me
Now you wish you was loyal
Girl you weren't loyal to me
No, you weren't loyal to me
Girl you weren't loyal to me
No, you wish you was loyal now

[Outro]
Now, now, too late now
Now, now, you wish you was loyal now
Now, now, too late now
Now, now, you wish you was loyal now
