-Lost in the world, me and my girlfriend
Protect me from my enemies.. Lost in the world me and me and my girl
Hold me down through the misery

I ain't gonna lie that pussy Fire as a mutherfucker
Already, when she fuck, she fuck steady
Hole wide open, Finger fuck her and she Bust nutts everywhere
Nigguh you love that dark hoe ! I take her everywhere
She ride with me, she fly with me, on private jets..
Go on on the levi and fuck her i call that rough sex
All her body real good have her real smooth
Pull her hair back when i fuck her might be fucken true
I love her . bcuz she never talk back to me
Never take people's side, never leave me by my side
She like to chill on my block and just chill wit me
Pop a pill with me

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
They say the bigger the tick the deeper the root

You pussy niggas ain't ready for her head game

-Lost in the world, me and my girlfriend
Protect me from my enemies.. Lost in the world me and me and my girl
Hold me down through the misery

She talk crazy to everybody, ain't got no respect
She hate bitch(bitch), she like to spit on it
Real standard bitch, she on that savage shit
Her babies dry looking for dads its that parent shit
Go to sleep wake up, she still look the same
She say she love the way i touch her with my fucken hands
She don't really like me to show her off
Too many people have her going off. & you dont want that
We been together since 13, but i cheated on her
Met a bitch named April K and i seed'ed on her
She the women these nigguhs respect my mind showed her ass

Winter time we be chillen in the house but i know my bitch bought
But im bought all the time
