[Chorus]
I'm just tryna stack a million
I ain't worried 'bout no nigga
I don't understand why these niggas wanna always tryna see me gone

Pussy niggas tryna finish homie
Talking bout they gonna send the homie

Make my dick piss blood try to voodoo a nigga
Throw a cross with my nigga try to shoot, shoot a nigga
Try to hang out with the help like you cool with a nigga (lord)
Please control these niggas these bitches

Please control my enemies keep these pussy niggas mending me

[Verse 2]
We just tryna make a million
I'm just tryna get a million nigga
I got a sore nose talk to my ten nigga
I born in like Denzel nigga
Badass bitch I got the style
Nigga I'm the youngest to the cal
Nigga I'm the youngest in the cal
Got me setting like a lucky lady
Bitch it's a brand new year
You won't see your nigga take out
I ain't gotta prickle me now
I can do well with the face out
I cut me ruler I had to go get to scrap the bottom of all sorts
I just go flex the rest in the restaurant  and I know that they notice us
I hop on the rains so making my game
Go rapping my game, game, game
I'm straight at the bottom making a right to the top and bang, bang, bang
I damage the chain nigga I ain't chained
Who keeping good our promises
I told my mommy I'm gonna squeeze my soul for breaking my promises

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna stack a million
I ain't worried 'bout no nigga
I don't understand why these niggas wanna always tryna see me gone
Keep the semi on
Keep the semi on
Keep the semi on
Keep the semi on

[Verse 3]
Homicide in the driveway
Shorty shoulda had a semi on
Homicide on a Friday
Just was with the nigga thursday morning
I've seen a murder money
I'm just tryna eat around this motherfucker
Cuz I ain't shit sweet around this motherfucker
Better take it with you when you leave home nigga
I better take it wit' you I don't wanna hear about another sad song nigga

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna stack a million
I ain't worried 'bout no nigga
I don't understand why these niggas wanna always tryna see me gone
Keep the semi on
Keep the semi on
Keep the semi on
Keep the semi on
