[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
Just left the funeral crying
Memories in my head of me and you on the grind
Put my nigga down in ashe may his soul rest in peace
Time to introduce you Niggas to the eight underneath
Track life k's full when we swang on your streets
Buss em up and we shut up when questioned by the police
Ball park one of you niggas can Jose Canseco on your ass
And when you from the power line lord save us your ass
Finger crashed they dead on sight
When we pull up bitch
Our rap sheet open cases
When you pull up clique Straight up on sight
Broad daylight don't do no internet beef
Can't swim in my sea i am jaws
I got a million of some teeth
I swang from both Sides when and we killing the empire
Your don't know anybody you spray
You murdered a G with A nickname with a clique
Who really bout that shit mane
Told my lawyer my Niggas loved me since elementary so why the fuck i need a hitman

Stay one with my Niggas yea
Yea I really miss my Niggas oh ohh
Stay one for my Niggas
Yea I really miss my Niggas
Stay one for my my my Niggas
