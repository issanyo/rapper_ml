And lately, I, been so confused
Dropped outta school got a beef and got a tool
Now I'm ready to chop ya crew
Been talkin to tha devil is whateva with lil bo
You ain't heard I was raised by some hard heads
They locked up or they all dead
Spoon fed or dog fed
We untame, that's how I play it
And everybody changin, trippin all a sudden
Ain't askin how I'm feelin they just askin me for money
Now three years ago they talked about me
Criticized me, and laughed at me
Called me local joker had lil boosie finna stop rappin
I'm still so confused, got bread and still ain't happy
Cause I'm lost without these pictures, lil I and my f*ckin daddy
God tell me bout this ho right here, is this just a ho right here? will she keep it gutta if a nigga go and blow this year
That purp is what we smoke this year
Blowin up I see it clear
Rap game on a nigga
I'm finna show them bitch that boosie real
That hatin cause I shake back
Brand new monte, take that
Real spinnas on it, whatever they want
I'm gon pay that
I got it so I lay back
Jung-out style
And I got a five westin connection
Ask my nigga lil rob
And I got diamonds on my pinky ring
Niggas wanna stank me manye
I flood the city with drank now they callin me the drank king
I'm still tryna maintain, fore I catch me a case
Tryna make baton rouge look like cali and you still gon hate?
And I don't lost alot of niggas, my trust f*cked up
And I done did some dirty shit that's why my luck f*cked up
It ain't no purple in the city so I'm sippin that tus
I mention like smoke out friday when he hit that dust
Member of them zigzag big sacks them burberry dates
When you snatched your first purse went hit the mall and got laid
Manye they got niggas in the grave so confused
They saw they death comin and they could'ntduck them tools
And lately, I been gettin too motherf*ckin high
I'm on my third blunt before the f*ckin sun rise
From the cradle to the grave
I'm gon always keep it gutta
I should be number 1 on everybodys list, motherf*cka
And lately, I, been so confused dropped outta school got a beef and got a tool (tool tool tool)
