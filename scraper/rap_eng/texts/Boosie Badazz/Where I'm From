[Intro]
Where I'm from
Boosie Blues Cafe
That cafe, nigga
Where I'm from

[Chorus]
'Bout a million miles from Cali (Million miles from Cali)
That's where I'm from (That's where I'm from)
Not too far from Granny (I ain't too far from Granny)
That's where I'm from (Yeah, that's where I'm from)
Baton Rouge, Louisiana (I'm out that mud, nigga)
I'm from the slums (Yeah, I'm from the slums)
No mercy, baby (No mercy, baby)
That's where I'm from (That's where I'm from)
These niggas crazy (Hey), get your gun
Where I'm from'll make you say, mm-hmm-hmm
Spinnin' every day, every day, mm-hmm-hmm (Yah)

[Verse]
No mercy, baby (No mercy, baby)
Where I'm from (Straight up)
They hit cops where I'm from (Fuck 12, fuck 12)
Another black man dead (Fuck 12, fuck 12)
Shot him down with a gun (Fuck 12, fuck 12, damn)
Right in front his son (Fuck 12, fuck 12, can't you see?)
No mercy, baby (It's no mercy, baby)
Where I'm from (Where I'm from)
Can't even trust your lady (Don't trust your lady)
If she love money (Talk to 'em)
These people racist, it's all on they faces (Where I'm from)
They want us in cages (Want us in cages)
Or dead on the pavement (Huh)

[Chorus]
'Bout a million miles from Cali (Million miles from Cali)
That's where I'm from (That's where I'm from)
Not too far from Granny (I ain't too far from Granny)
That's where I'm from (Yeah, that's where I'm from)
Baton Rouge, Louisiana (I'm out that mud, nigga)
I'm from the slums (Yeah, I'm from the slums)
No mercy, baby (No mercy, baby)
That's where I'm from (That's where I'm from)
These niggas crazy (Hey), get your gun
Where I'm from'll make you say, mm-hmm-hmm
Spinnin' every day, every day, mm-hmm-hmm
