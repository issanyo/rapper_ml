[Intro]
Coming up I wanted a money roll to get a honor roll
Bitches so bad you think about 'em man they conscience cold
And I'll take these bitches over a 100 hoes
Straight like that
Livin' galore I'm talkin' shape like that
Got the body of the goddess with a face to match
Grade A niggas so "grade A" I attract
No C's or D's on my team
Girl you a title

[Hook]
Check out my honor roll
Grade A bitches, Grade A, Grade A, Grade A bitches
Check out my honor roll
Grade A bitches, put your hands up if you a Grade A bitch
Check out my honor roll
Grade A bitches Grade A Grade A with my bitches
Check out my honor roll
Grade A bitches, put your hands up if you a Grade A bitch

[Verse 1]
Red bone slim waist
Pretty face pretty pussy Grade A
Can't forget my Harlem chick the baddest upstate
Perfect ass but it look fake
Can't forget my West Side bitch out the A
She ? nigga we at the dealership nigga
Got the chick at King Of Diamonds man she ? too
Bad bitches across the world love Boosie Boo
My LA she a model yes her sex appeal make it holla
Perfect eye liner
My H-Town chick man all she do is wear designer
Got her own shit man she a grinder

[Verse2]
Own car own house
Weave, purse and her hair bounce
Can't forget my Jamaican girl with no stomach
Whole family street style she got old money
My Puerto Rican superbad she got a walk on her
Sexy sassy anything she got a mouth on her
My Memphis girl lord knows I bet the house on her
I got a Chinese broad bad as Nicki Minaj
Honor roll honor roll
Where you at girl?
Catch the walk look bad make it clap girl
Red bottoms ten out of time my boss bitch
You see the shit I got on? Nigga she bought this
Chanel bags, 5 swag, that's my snow bunny
Blonde hair, blue eyes, that's a cold bunny
My Cali girl, she standin' 5'3
She favor Halle Berry, and she bad as can be
