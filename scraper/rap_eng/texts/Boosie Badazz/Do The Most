[Intro]
Two red bones kissing in the back seat
I like girls who like girls that attract me
My side bitch in the club
My main bitch at the bar
I’m talking to some other girls
Like I don’t even know who they are

[Chorus]
I say I, do the most
I say I, do the most

[Verse 1]
This month, Imma own that bitch
One stand by me and my A team
My ghetto bitch keep fucking with my main line
My ghetto bitch keep it realer than my main line
I know they say I fucked a couple superstar
Guess so, I’m bad like Miles
Kinda hot, looking better than they ever did
Doing me, taking care my relative
And both my bitches in the club with me
The one who act right
That’s the who go with me
On that liquor so I’m feeling the moment
Outta jail, getting mailed
And the bitches are lonely
Congratulate on the pussy
Motherfucker for sure
Round my way they say I’m doing the most
Big balls, soso, lifestyle heavy
Me and my bad bitch
Looking for a bedroom

[Chorus]
I say I, do the most
I say I, do the most

[Verse 2]
Ain’t gonna lie
I told her I was gonna treat her right
But, blame it on the lifestyle
Manny bad bitches, not to fight
We be down last night
In the suit, me and three freaks
Popping spades in the hot tub bath
Damn look down at the phone girl
Who I left at the crib calling
Nigga where you at
She must know I miss some cash
Her girl fucking my dude
She the undercover rat
I’m flying to the bed
Blocking your number
Go and get a cat
Who rocking for hundred
Fresh outta prison, I’m stunted
I was too damn big, I got money
Mamma said I look good, but I said I looked better
No shirt,tucked out
Why these nigga rock leather

[Chorus]
I say I, do the most
I say I, do the most

[Outro]
Two red bones kissing in the back seat
Two red bones kissing in the back seat
Two red bones kissing in the back seat
They bisexual, but it’s cool
Two redbone, on the mall
Two redbone, on the mall
Two redbone, doing them all
It's payday
It’s payday nigga
It’s payday nigga
It’s payday nigga
And I’m doing them all
