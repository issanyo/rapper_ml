[Intro]
Boosie Badazz
Look like we got a problem, baby baby (Lil' mama)
Time ain't on my hands (Time ain't on my hands)

[Chorus]
Look like we got a problem (We got a problem)
Problem (Like we got a problem)
Time ain't on my hands for you (Hands for you)
And that's a problem (And that's your problem)
Look like we got a problem (We got a problem)
Problem (Lil' mama)
Time ain't on my hands for you (Hands for you)
Can't be playin' with you (Nah, I can't be playin')

[Verse 1]
I gotta get to the money (Gotta get to the money)
Money (I gotta get paid)
Go be broke just layin' with you (Gonna be broke, bitch)
Can't be broke just layin' with you (What you gon' say then?)
I got kids by the hundreds
Got kids by the hundreds (All these kids)
And baby, they come for you (I gotta keep it real)
They always gon' come for you, I love my crew (Yeah)
Four shows every week, girl you know what's up (What's up)
If you ain't flyin' out to meet, how we gonna cut?
I got money on my mind, I'm a true hustler (True hustler)
I ain't got time, or baby girl, I could do for you

[Chorus]
Look like we got a problem (Aw shit)
Problem (Looks like we got a problem)
Time ain't on my hands for you (Time ain't on my hand)
And that's a problem (And that's your problem)
Look like we got a problem (Like we got a problem)
Lil' mama (Lil' mama)
Time ain't on my hands for you (I'm sorry)
Can't be playin' with you

[Verse 2]
I do shows every weekend (Every weekend)
Gettin' money (Gettin' that bag)
I'm a daddy on the weekdays (I'm a good ass daddy)
One hundred (One, one hundred)
Diabetes freed my day right up though
Stickin' needles in my stomach (Take my time over here)
All this stuff every day
Where's the time for a woman? (I'm tryin', but fuck)
Today I'm goin' to the bank (I'm goin' to the bank)
I just wanna get away (I just wanna get away)
I ain't pickin' up the A (I ain't pickin' up the phone)
No pussy, not today
I'm gettin' money, man, I'm straight

[Chorus]
That's a problem (That's a problem we got)
Problem (That's a problem)
Time ain't on my hands for you (Nah)
And that's a problem (And that's my problem)
She say we got a problem (She say we got a problem)
Lil' mama (Ooh, we got a problem)
Time ain't on my hands for you (Nah)
I can't be playin' with you and layin' with you

[Post-Chorus]
That's a problem
That's a problem
Can't be layin' with you
That's a problem
That's a problem

[Verse 3]
I'm tryna grind for you, provide for you (You're always talkin' shit)
I can't do that if I'm layin' with you and playin' with you (I can't come up layin' in the bed)
When we together it's a smile on you (You know that)
'Cause I know it ain't much time with you (That's my problem)
Probably need more time with you (Time with you)
Girl I'm on tour 'round here all summer (Damn)
I'm gon' be gone all summer (Damn)
Go to Baton Rouge, that's the time for my mama (Damn)
And then I'm comin' for my mama (Damn)
Gotta show love to the motherfuckin' homies (Love the homies, nigga)
Yeah yeah
Even if you leave, man, I still got the homies (Girl, I still got my homies)
Yeah yeah

[Outro]
Say my niggas, they a problem, haha (Yeah)
She mad at mine, ooh, layin' with you, problem
Problem, lil' mama
Problem, time for you
