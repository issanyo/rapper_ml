[Intro]
“Hello”
“Bitch, where the fuck you at?”
“I’m in the studio, man. I’m on my way, man”
“I’m not gon’ be here when you get back. I’m gon’ be gone. Fuck that, I’m gon’ be gone.”
“Alright then”

[Hook]
Girl, why you always stressing me, stressing me
Stressing me?
Girl, why you always stressing me, stressing me

And I can’t even talk to you no more, oh girl
‘Cause you be stressing me, girl
And I just wanna lay with you sometimes
But you be stressing me, girl
(Man) Why you always stressing me, stressing me
Stressing me?
Girl, why you always stressing me, stressing me

And I can’t even talk to you no more, oh girl
‘Cause you be been stressing me, girl
And I just wanna lay with you sometimes
But you be stressing me, girl

[Verse 1]
Damn, why you stressing me knowing I need you next to me?
Yesterday, you questioned me soon as you finished texting me
Now you don’t want to talk when I don’t answer when you question me
Ain’t got time to fuck ‘cause that’ll mess up our whole recipe
Sometimes, I just want to lay with you, play fight like we used to do
You always been in cases, come on girl, I’m used to you
So I roll my switches full of kush and smoke ‘em back to back
‘Cause I know soon you gon’ accuse me of this and that (I don’t know this bitch)
And I don’t know what to do sometimes (man)
Loving you will make me lose my mind (man)
You went to really tripping, your stomach got bigger
Now you think the baby gon’ stop me from being a hundred with ya
We can make it is what I truly believe
(And I) Want you to change, but I don’t want you to leave
(And I) Feel all alone when you ain’t next to me
I hope your new year’s resolution stops stressing me

[Hook]
Girl, why you always stressing me, stressing me

Girl, why you always stressing me, stressing me
Stressing me
And I can’t even talk to you no more, oh girl
‘Cause you be stressing me, girl
And I just wanna lay with you sometimes
But you be stressing me, girl

[Verse 2]
I just want to chill with you, I don’t want to fight with you
Sick and tired, but I’m gon’ try to might it right with you
I know I travel, be gone, you be wishing me home
But chill sweetie, we eating, we on
Now you in my phone checking shit, real disrespectful shit
Accusing me of doing her? I might as well then
Used to be your best friend, sexing and texting
Plenty hoes want your spot, I’m your blessing
Let your hair back, kick your feet up, stop stressing
You say I’m fucking with my baby momma, that’s out of the question
Stop guessing, talking reckless, you’re doing too much
I peeped your game, you’re trying to fight, fuck and make up
For real (man)

[Hook]

And I can’t even talk to you no more, oh girl
‘Cause you be stressing me, girl
And I just wanna lay with you sometimes
But you be stressing me, girl
