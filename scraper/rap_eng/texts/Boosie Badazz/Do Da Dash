[Chorus:]
I run and I check up
I got to go get it I’m chasing that bad
Nothing but twenties and fifties and hundreds are stuck in my stash
I promise my mama, I got to see how much it is in the cash
I got the pedal to the medal
Bitch I be doing it dash
I’m doing it dash (doing it dash) [x2]
I’m running my check up
I gotta go do it
I’m doing it dash
I’m doing it dash (doing it dash) [x2]
I promise my mama I got to see how much

[Verse 1:]
Running, I’m running
I’m running my check up
Check up (check up)
I’m talking twenties,fifties and hundreds
I collect them at Heather
She told me oh my gosh, I guess I am pressured
I guess this bitch is by my side so she know I’m Nessa
Shout out to my CEO I swear that boy just blessed us
Dirty dance, I just hit my peak and risk a nigga
Blink
Told my momma no more problems
What we got to stress for
Told my family I got them
I got book in extra
I gotta get it, stay limit in every city
Every time I’m spending Gucci,Louis, Prada, Fendi
Talking twenties, fifties, hundreds, hundreds, twenties, fifties
Never do the limit
Never ever do the limit

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Gotta speed up on them niggas
Zooming through the city, doing a hundred and fifty
Fuck 12
Middle fingers to the pork, Officer Piggy (oink, oink)
Gotta committed, committed to only my dollars and benzes
I’m focusing on robots
Rose Rouses, drivers in Bentleys
Collect every pennies
The hustle up in me I’m doing my job
My bitch be nagging, so Imma cop me some Louis Vuitton
Your bitch so nasty she work magic when she use her tongue
And I toss her, just imagine where I shoot the come
I tell a broke nigga Imma go and get it
Told my niggas to stay loyal
And they going with me, come on
Told my loyal bitch my story and they going with it
I won’t never do the limit
Never do the limit

[Chorus]
