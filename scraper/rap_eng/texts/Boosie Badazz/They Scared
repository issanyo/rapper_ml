Intro
We got these pussy niggas scared

Verse 1

I'll put you in a casket, crawled on by the maggots
Fuck around with Boosie Bad Azz and the clique, shit will get nasty
Put you in a pamper, turn you small like a hamster
Call rigo real marlo mont
Lil nigga won't you g'on come stand fa ya
I'm a all around hustla
I don't know why niggas hate me
But ya whole family gon die real talk mane whoever try to take me
See I brought it in the club cause I know my situation
I know how these pussy niggas hatin
But I put it on you
And him

Chorus

Oo it's choppa season
Oo oo they don't want it, they don't want it
I'll take ya homie x2
Leave ya whole clique lonely x2
And you don't understand we got these pussy niggas scared
They scared
They scared

I can leave you in the driveway
I catch you slippin on the highway
You can run Monday, run Tuesday, run Wednesday
We gon catch you buy Friday
Boy
After I hurt ya people, I might go to Costal Rica
Come back to the club like "What thug nigga?"
I be thuggin like its legal
Boy
Bring that drama to the South
You gon get thugged out
Ass to bucked up and fucked up
Bitch I'mma knock ya brains out
Closed casket
See I brought it in the club cause I know my situation
I know how these pussy niggas hatin
But I put it on you
And him

Chorus

Oo its choppa season
It ain't a game
Gotta be a beast in these streets where we hang
Most niggas want ya fame
Some niggas want ya chain
Niggas hate to see a nigga shinnin, damn shame
Shoot em up
Bang bang
That's the code that we live by
Money got me real fly
Kush got me real high
Closet full of guns mane a nigga gotta feel my
Muthafuckin pain ask T.I it ain't a game
Rollin with my soldiers, rollin on roller
Nigga look wrong he can get fucked over
Playin hard that ain't nothing to me, so don't come fuckin with me
2 23's and 40 Glocks, will make ya fuckin heart stop

Chorus

Oo it's choppa season
Oo oo they don't want it
I'll take ya homie
Leave ya whole clique lonely
See I brought it in the club cause I know my situation
I know how these pussy niggas hatin
But I put it on you
And him
Oo it's choppa season
