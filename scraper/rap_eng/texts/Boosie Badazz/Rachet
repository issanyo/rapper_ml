[Intro: Hurricane Chris]
You know you’re ratchet
(I ain’t no ratchet)
Man
(You got me fucked up, you know what take me home)

[Hook]
Aye, off top I’m a ratchet nigga
So you already know I’m getting ratchet with it
Cause everybody got some ratchet in 'em
Everybody, everybody got some ratchet in 'em, ratchet in 'em
Everybody got some ratchet in 'em
Everybody, everybody got some ratchet in 'em, ratchet in 'em
Everybody got some ratchet in 'em
Everybody, everybody got some ratchet in 'em

[Verse 1: Hurricane Chris]
This for the nigga who be stunting in his baby momma car
Ran out of gas in his baby momma car
When his baby momma call he ain’t gon' answer the phone
Cause he know she gon’ tell him to bring your ratchet ass home
Tonight we going hard ‘till the lights come on
Tell the DJ “Play that Hurricane”, that’s my song
Took a break for a minute, now I’m back in my zone
And don’t nobody try to jack him cause he packin’ that chrome
In the club spending money, but I like beer do
That’s ratchet as hell, girl, shame on you
He done paid five hundred for the brand new Jay's
And had on the same clothes for the last two days
Your sister, brother, auntie, uncle
50 years old in the club with they youngsters
Your niece off of the leash
17, but be tellin’ people she 23
Damn, I’m just keepin’ G
Everybody got some ratchet in ‘em, even me
She know I hit her sister, but she still let me beat
I done done that shit so many times I can’t speak
Now that’s the definition of a real live freak
And I’m the definition of a real life beast
So drop it to the floor, bust it open, I want to see
The way she workin’ that pole I might just throw her a G

[Hook]
Aye, off top I’m a ratchet nigga
So you already know I’m getting ratchet with it
Cause everybody got some ratchet in 'em
Everybody, everybody got some ratchet in 'em, ratchet in 'em
Everybody got some ratchet in 'em
Everybody, everybody got some ratchet in 'em, ratchet in 'em
Everybody got some ratchet in 'em
Everybody, everybody got some ratchet in 'em

[Verse 2: Lil’ Boosie]
Booty shots lookin' good, Maliah-thick
Pretty face, god damn, she need her teeth fixed
And her cousin real bad, she petite-thick
But her breath smell like she been eating shit
I need to look in the mirror, I'm sorry
5 different baby mamas, should be on Maury
My cousin ratchet, he be sexin' my cousin
My boy on Instagram flexin', that ain't even his money
I know this girl out the hood she be flossin’, stop
My boy got them drawers for a Michael Kors watch
My little dog touched down, I call feds
Stole a lot of mixes, ratchet ass back in jail
I know this girl getting money, she a hustler
But she had her uncle, the nephews, the brothers
I know this chick threw up on my stick
Wipe myself off, put it back in her mouth, ratchet

[Hook]
Aye, off top I’m a ratchet nigga
So you already know I’m getting ratchet with it
Cause everybody got some ratchet in 'em
Everybody, everybody got some ratchet in 'em, ratchet in 'em
Everybody got some ratchet in 'em
Everybody, everybody got some ratchet in 'em, ratchet in 'em
Everybody got some ratchet in 'em
Everybody, everybody got some ratchet in 'em

[Verse 3: Hurricane Chris]
Uh, she be trying to act perfect
Hundred dollar bill, she ain’t even much worth it
Ah, girl you know you’re ratchet
Instagram flexin’ with income taxes
Louis Vuitton purse so yeah she lookin’ classy
But her kid sleepin’ on an air mattress
New pants, new shoes and a Gucci coat
Eviction notice on a nigga’s front door
“Be out by tomorrow” - that’s what it say
But he was runnin’ around acting like he had cake
Yeah, everybody got some ratchet in ‘em
Some got a lot and some got a little
Uh, I be doing my thing
I keep a bunch of bad yellow-bones hollin’ my name
Before we get back to the room, I be gettin’ some brain
Getting some brain? Yup, getting some brain
I got my niggas with me too so we runnin’ a train
I like to hit ‘em from the back while they wearin’ my chain
I’mma make it hurricane, we ain’t makin’ it rain
Make-make makin' it rain, we the ratchet gang

[Hook]
Aye, off top I’m a ratchet nigga
So you already know I’m getting ratchet with it
Cause everybody got some ratchet in 'em
Everybody, everybody got some ratchet in 'em, ratchet in 'em
Everybody got some ratchet in 'em
Everybody, everybody got some ratchet in 'em, ratchet in 'em
Everybody got some ratchet in 'em
Everybody, everybody got some ratchet in 'em
