[HOOK]
I make noise by myself
Slang them toys by myself
Did my time by myself
Write my rhymes by myself
Move packs by myself
Kill rats by myself
Told tha judge free my girl
Mane I did it by myself
Me, Myself, and I (7x)
Just Me, Myself and I

[VERSE 1]
Every since they took I
It been me, myself, and I
Middle finger to the world
My berretta on my side
I ain’t tellin’ on myself
I ain’t talkin’ to tha folk
Ride for me, I die for me
Shit that’s all a nigga know
Nigga told on me befo’
Had me facing death row
Say we got you on these bodies
Do you wanna talk? No!
Shit I bought my own work nigga
Built my own clientele
Guess who own my label nigga
Me, Myself, and I bitch
Dress my ass off nigga
I don’t need a stylist
I’m from Garfield street nigga
I don’t trust nann bitch
WCW, Jerico I slam shit
I fuck a ho, that’s on me
But I don’t trust nann bitch

[HOOK]
I make noise by myself
Slang them toys by myself
Did my time by myself
Write my rhymes by myself
Move packs by myself
Kill rats by myself
Told tha judge free my girl
Mane I did it by myself
Me, Myself, and I (7x)
Just Me, Myself and I

[VERSE 2]
Told tha judge free my girl
Told ‘em that I made her do it
Loc ain’t make me, Trill ain’t make me
Nigga I made Boosie
I made niggas, made niggas
Made niggas way realer
Even on tha monkey bars, nigga I ain’t play wit’ em
By myself, all alone
By myself, I move zones
1 deep wit’ that heat buckin’ through tha school zone
Free Lil Bronson, Free Lil Titus
Lil Joe Joe josin’ by his self
Shoulda told them niggas no
When them niggas called for help
Shit I write my own music nigga
Shoot my own videos
I don’t do no ugly bitches
Me, Myself, and pretty ho’s
Bought my first Girbaud’s by myself
They was stone washed
Never back down
By myself, I got a lion heart

[HOOK]
I make noise by myself
Slang them toys by myself
Did my time by myself
Write my rhymes by myself
Move packs by myself
Kill rats by myself
Told tha judge free my girl
Mane I did it by myself
Me, Myself, and I (7x)
Just Me, Myself and I
