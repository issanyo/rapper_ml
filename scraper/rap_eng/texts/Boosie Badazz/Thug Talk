[INTRO: BOOSIE TALKING]
I'd like to welcome everybody to Thug Talk
A lot of people won't understand Thug Talk
But they got millions of people who will understand Thug Talk
If you don't understand, I want you to listen to song for song
Song for song and by the end, you will understand
Thug Talk
So, feel me now nigga
Feel me now

[HOOK]
We say Mama don't worry
But we can't promise no worry
We say sister be cool
Even when it ain't cool
Tell our nephews to chill but they wanna live just like you

We say Mama don't worry
But we can't promise no worry
We say sister be cool
Even when it ain't cool
Tell our nephews to chill when they wanna live just like you

[VERSE 1]
At night we pray for better days
Hope trouble go its separate ways
Bad luck we accept it like we goin' thru a phase
Tell Mama don't worry
We gon' be straight, we say we got it
Still she worry bout haters
And our safety from the narcotics
So when you leave she hit her knees
And plead that God protect her son
He say he straight
But he really thuggin' and he accept it how it come
Tell his sister be cool
But her fear of losin' you is tragic
You big brother, and she love ya
But she ain't never had a Daddy
You do thangs to make her happy
But that make her sit and think
She ask you when you gon' stop thuggin'
But he look and say he can't
Cause he got rank
Poured tha Act up out tha pint
Money everywhere
His nephew stare
And that's tha one you tellin' chill
This real

[HOOK]
We say Mama don't worry
But we can't promise no worry
We say sister be cool
Even when it ain't cool
Tell our nephews to chill but they wanna live just like you

We say Mama don't worry
But we can't promise no worry
We say sister be cool
Even when it ain't cool
Tell our nephews to chill when they wanna live just like you

[VERSE 2]
My hustle got me comin' thru
My nephew wanna hustle too
I tell him chill
He tell me Boo, I'm hurtin' if I don't hustle too
What I'm 'posed to do?
Used to tell Big Mama everything gon' be aight
'Could see tha look up in her eyes like it just might not be aight
Thug Talk
Like I'm gon' make it out this fuckin' neighborhood
But wit' no change mane I'm stuck up in this fuckin' neighborhood
Since Pampers I was lead by examples
But it was different
Only ones I looked up to was tha niggas who was really gettin' it
Thug Talk
Tell another thug Mama it's gon' be ok
When her son sittin' up in that casket 3 feet away
How I'm gon' tell lil' daddy put down tha guns
When it's on my waist
How I'm gon' tell lil' daddy life sweet
Wit' this look on my face

[HOOK]
We say Mama don't worry
But we can't promise no worry
We say sister be cool
Even when it ain't cool
Tell our nephews to chill but they wanna live just like you

We say Mama don't worry
But we can't promise no worry
We say sister be cool
Even when it ain't cool
Tell our nephews to chill when they wanna live just like you
