[Intro]
Say thug
Them niggas at war across town
Sad part about it, them niggas used to be on the same corner, same block
Now they’re beefing
Boosie Badazz
Street wars turn violent
Real talk

[Verse 1]
These niggas used to run together, thug and stunt together
This when they was juveniles smoking weed, sipping jungle juice
One blew, one hustled, never grew, so he building cases
Throwing slangs in his words, this nigga really hate him
Never thinking ‘bout this nigga money on his mind
If his homie don’t see this coming, then homie blind
They kicked the door, hit for the works, somebody knew the spot
Cameras got ‘em, it was them niggas off your own block
But guess who sent them though? It was his nigga, yo
He like “not my nigga though, he dangerous, got to kill him though”
So K’s bust in ‘cause both sides will grave something
Keep it with me, you ain’t saying nothing

[Hook]
Street wars turn violent
Old friends shooting old friends
Wild gun firing
Damn, got to keep it everywhere I go
Street wars turn violent
Damn dog, why you want to kill me?
Now I see it’s gun firing
Chopper, chopper, chopper
Put that on my mama
Street wars turn violent

[Verse 2]
Verse 2 for all my niggas in the dirt too
Murked a lot of niggas, but in the end, he got murked too
We Chi-Town living up in my city, strictly give you the business
E-, e-, e-, everybody got extensions
On the powerline, the tenants, everybody thugging
Nigga just had a shootout and them niggas second cousins (damn)
What the fuck going on?
Nigga shooting at each other ‘bout a song, better have your pistol
Fuck around with Boosie Boo, better have your hitters
I don’t have no feelings, turn to Mad Max, nigga
Them niggas killing for their boy who was a rat
But that boy took care of niggas, they’re coming back

[Hook]
Street wars turn violent
Old friends shooting old friends
Wild gun firing
Damn, got to keep it everywhere I go
Street wars turn violent
Damn dog, why you want to kill me?
Now I see it’s gun firing
Chopper, chopper, chopper
Put that on my mama
Street wars turn violent

[Verse 3]
They’ve done killed Big Nut, what the fuck?
Got the whole ATL fucked up, rest in peace, blood
It’ll never end for Soulja Slim, rest in peace, thug
Niggas changing by the hour, this is me, thug
They killed this nigga’s son, now they’re busting guns
Fighting in the club, ain’t no 1-on-1
They just killed this little hustler
But the hustler had some first cousins and a big brother, and they’re all slanging
Even a scary nigga’s killing, they’re all dangerous
Big dog just made the call, now they’re all stinking
Niggas murking each other right on the set
One nigga jealous of the next

[Hook]
Street wars turn violent
Old friends shooting old friends
Wild gun firing
Got to keep it everywhere I go
Street wars turn violent
Damn dog, why you want to kill me?
Now I see it’s gun firing
Chopper, chopper, chopper
Put that on my mama
Street wars turn violent
