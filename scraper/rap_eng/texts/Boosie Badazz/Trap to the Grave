[Intro: Boston George]
Yeah, good dope, guarantee the fiends come runnin' (yeah)
Good dick, guarantee that she come runnin' (I swear)
Hit that hook and she hook on phonics (I swear)
If the feds come, guarantee that me go runnin' (you dig?)
I just wanna make it safe, I just wanna make it safe
Hope my niggas make it safe, hope my niggas make it safe

[Chorus: Boston George]
Trap nigga to the grave, trap nigga to the grave
Trap nigga to the grave, trap nigga to the grave
I just wanna make it safe, I just wanna make it safe
Hope my niggas make it safe, trap nigga to the grave

[Verse 1: Boston George]
Came up, nigga fell off
Fell off, nigga bounced back
When a nigga ain't got nothin'
All he can risk is his fuckin' life
Risked mine so many times
Cat ain't got shit on me
Heard cats got nine lives
I been shot at more than nine times
I-10 with a quarter ticket
Phone call, yell touchdown
Ruth Chriss, yeah stuffed chicken
That's what I call my stash spot
Niggas haves and they have nots
Sold wholes and the half blocks
Came up off the crack rock
Bury me on my block

[Chorus: Boston George]
Trap nigga to the grave, trap nigga to the grave
Trap nigga to the grave, trap nigga to the grave
I just wanna make it safe, I just wanna make it safe
Hope my niggas make it safe, trap nigga to the grave

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Trap nigga to the grave, all of my niggas make play
I'm tellin' you pussies behave, or I'm killin' you niggas like AIDS
Thirty ounces in the mad room, we be countin' in the mad room
Sixteen shots in the calico, I shoot straight as a bow and arrow nigga
I had that cluck distributed, servin' the cluckers and users
Servin' the smokers and tutors, I get the syrup from Houston
I'm just tryna make it safe, boy we dirty, drive straight
Two thirty, we ain't late, two hundred K up in the Wraith
Goin' see Thugger Thugger Thugger, we listen to me in the boombox
Toody like dad that look ugly, say my lil G, that's the moonrock
Go get it on every street
I know the block how I roll
When I'm gone make sure some trap niggas carry me
Like Boston and Snow nigga

[Chorus: Boston George]
Trap nigga to the grave, trap nigga to the grave
Trap nigga to the grave, trap nigga to the grave
I just wanna make it safe, I just wanna make it safe
Hope my niggas make it safe, trap nigga to the grave

[Verse 3: Dave East]
Trap nigga to the casket, 95 South with the ratchet
Heard them niggas got it but they taxin'
Residue all on my hand from baggin'
I put pistols in my mattress
Quarters come and touched another package
Order somethin', bought another mass
Whippin' up a half, in the kitchen laughin'
My fellows is predicates
I don't mix well with emotions, save that for a therapist
All black Suburban, I'm strapped with a turban
I swear they gon' think I'm a terrorist
Fell in love with the block so I married it
Tryna hide you some paper, just bury it
This Glock like ID how I carry it
30 and broke, I swear that shit embarrassing
Snow in the middle of summer
I tinted the rental, go pick up an onion
I used to bag up, not feelin' my knuckles
I bust down the Rollie, it feel like I'm frontin'
No nine to five, I ain't fillin' out nothin'
These smokers out here, they are still in abundance
Christian look balanced like twenty-six hundred
If they spin the block they gon' get what they wanted
We trappers

[Chorus: Boston George]
Trap nigga to the grave, trap nigga to the grave
Trap nigga to the grave, trap nigga to the grave
I just wanna make it safe, I just wanna make it safe
Hope my niggas make it safe, trap nigga to the grave
