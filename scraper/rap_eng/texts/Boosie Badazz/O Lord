[Intro]
Oh Lord, I ain't gon' do no more wrong
I wish I was a baby in my mama's home
You see the judge gave me the time up in there court
I went from a million dollar home to a cell 8 by 4
Oh Lord

[Hook]
Oh Oh Oh Lord Oh Lord
I ain't gon' do no more wrong
Oh Oh Oh Lord Oh Lord
The whole pen sayin'
Oh Oh Oh Lord Oh Lord
I just wanna go home
Oh Oh Oh Lord Oh Lord
(You feel me now nigga)

[Verse 1]
To go home you can have my home and all my redbones
Know when I'm free I'll get it back cause my head strong
Fuck all who's wildin' out, I can't keep fuckin' up
Judge hit the hammer and reality strucks
Ain't no place like home, I'm looking at the window
Thinking 'bout my kinfolk wishin' I had some indo
Do the time, do the crime time, thinkin' so
Wish that I could get a miracle relief from (hit 'em up)
I'm in the pen now, whish that I was still a baby
Gettin' rock to sleep, listening to sweet sadie
Fuck all these fat mouths and niggas I'mma let 'em ride
You think I'm pussy, it's all good, walk away and smile
Promise this time father God I'mma use my mind
Trynna to do no more wrong, and I'mma gon' pay my tithes
Momma asks me sh*t Boosie what's wrong ? Nothin' Connie
I just want to go home, I just want to go

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothin' in this bitch for me, know what I'm talking 'bout
Rather be broke on the street than a penitention box
Nigga on the side but man he came to the pen strong
Stuck in them cells fuck them up now as mine gone
My other neighbor caught an L at only 15
He only fucked one girl before he left the streets
My heart goes out too, his situation affected me
Fuck goin' on a call out, I wanna walk free
I had super bad bitches that was hood to me
Now they've got bad built bitches lookin' good to me
The judge gave me that time though my heart stopped
My eyes watered up on me, nigga my suggar dropped
I need somethin' out this bitch, they've got me stressin'
I need some peas', Mac & cheese and cornbread dressing
Momma asks me sh*t Boosie what's wrong  Nothin' momma
I just want to go home, I just want to go

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Oh Lord, that's why I'll holla as the food turns sour
Faceing seven murders cause your goons turns south
Oh Lord, that's why I'll holla get me out this bitch
Long nights, plenty prayers, now I'm outchea rich
My niggas in there sick I know mook pray I blow
He been down 19 and he's just 34
Purple dro we need (Oh Lord) to put all mine in these
Nigga get real time, why not smoke weed ?

[Hook]

[Outro]
Free Titus nigga, Free Meechie, Free mook, Free flea, nigga, Free one nigga
Free five? nigga, Free van, Free Joe, Free that nigga C-Murder man
Free B.G., Free boo the wild thang  nigga, Free Mac, Free Mandigo
Free wanye perry nigga, Free part time too Lil nigga
All the real niggas I ain't forgot y'all

They just wanna go home, they just wanna go home
And if they go home, they ain't gon' do no more wrong
They just wanna go home
Oh Lord
