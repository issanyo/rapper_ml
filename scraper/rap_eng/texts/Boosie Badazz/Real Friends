I miss my nigga Darryl Milton

A real friend gon' love you like a brother

We need real friends
Love ya like brothers

[HOOK]
This world need real friends
To love ya like a brother
Sometimes we need friends
To love ya like a brother

[VERSE 1]
1 shot for my nigga Big Kirby
He been thuggin wit me since we was comin' up
Behind me
He'll shoot a nigga up
Shit 1 time we went to jail
He told tha police that was his stuff
All I gotta do is look
And he'll be quick to boot ya up
He don't give fuck
You ain't gon talk bout Boosie round Bleek
Cuz he gon say sumin
So don't tell me that's yo friend
If they talk, and u don't say nothing
Donkey my dawg
He got to stand wit a suit on
Meanin his words
Fuck the world, I'm bringin Boo home
Me and Reb waited too long
Toolin niggas too strong
Fightin them bodies in Angola mane
Now me and Ruger mane, we both home
I love you nigga
You so solid mane
I know you a real friend
That's gon love me like a brother
Sometimes we need friends
Who gon' love me like a brother

Look
Got yo back when you need me
When you call she be there
Fuck that
I'm comin to see ya any jail, anywhere
A real friend will lift you up
No matter what she be there
She ain't gon' fuck her girl nigga
She ain't gon' take that shit there
A friend gon' know what you goin thru
Hurt when you hurt
Know what you feel inside
It's like a feeling we got
Everybody in competition
If everybody chill out
Everybody can get money round this muthafucka
That's what's wrong


[HOOK]
This world need real friends
To love ya like a brother
Sometimes we need friends
To love ya like a brother

Watch my back if you're my friend
You'll be my passenger in every car
Don't be my homie,  be my friend
One of tha closest niggas to my heart
Don't tell on me if I'm your friend
You take our secrets to tha grave and all
I got yo kids, you got my kids shit if we ever fall
I got his back
I'm clutchin bad behind my fuckin dawg
I went to jail
They killed my friend

[BOOSIE TALKING TO THE END]
