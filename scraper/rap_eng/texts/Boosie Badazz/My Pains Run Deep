[Intro]
Oh lawd
Oh lawd

[HOOK]
Too many dead on tha same street
My pain run deep
3 dead in tha same Jeep
My pain run deep
Prosecutor tryna frame me
My pain run deep
They shootin’ at me
Tryna slain me
My pain run deep

[VERSE 1]
You know I be wit’ that
Vest on wit’ that choppa tho
Will bang it all at Pappadeaux
You, You, You
All ya’ll
The impossible
I ain’t runnin’ from nobody
We got problems
We neglect it
Only here to send 1 message
Pussy boy
You gon’ respect it
Killed Ivy
Tha whole car too
So you know I can’t bar you
On site if I saw you
Dearly depart you
Damn homie how they caught you
Many nights
Wish I could call you
The same way I feel bout my father
Lost Ghost
It hurted harder than the muthafuckin’ kidney stone nigga
Cuz that kidney stone sharp
But this shit here long nigga
Damn Titus
I wish I could bond ya out nigga
But they don’t want our money
They wanna take us out

[HOOK]
Too many dead on tha same street
My pain run deep
3 dead in tha same Jeep
My pain run deep
Prosecutor tryna frame me
My pain run deep
They shootin’ at me
Tryna slain me
My pain run deep

[VERSE 2]
My nigga shot
And he can’t breathe
My pain run deep
I wouldn’t have stopped
They woulda got me
My pain run deep
Deathrow
They tried to stop me
My pain run deep
Diabetes out this i.v
Hospitals, hot pistols
We can’t leave home
If its not wit’ us
Boy my life is in another league
Duckin’ blues
Blowin’ trees
Fuck it
I’m tha leader of tha crabs
In the public, fuck it
It’s ugly
That money don’t mean shit right now
I need surgery
90 G’s or they won’t cut me
My pain run deep
I’m on tha table
And I’m gettin nervous
My pain run deep
They put murders on my whole circle
My pain run deep
Tha bank
They hit me for a half a ticket
My pain run deep
I been goin’ through some thangs
I see blood in my eyes
Too many thugs in tha street
Who I loved
They done died
Murder 1
Slide, slide
Now a nigga baptized
So many murders on our street
We got murder on our mind
Most of us ain’t read tha signs
Smiled, and told em fuck ‘em
When indicted for my crime
Just cuz my cousin, my cousin
Shit they gave that boy a dime
My other cousin
He got 30
And he ain’t never been convicted
All my life
Man it been twisted
Say a prayer to all tha kids
Lick tha letter
Send it to you
Then you receive it on ya bid
Me and tha police got a bad history
Can’t stand them bitches
Before they killed Alton Sterling
They been spankin’ us niggas

[EDITED HOOK]
Too many dead on tha same street
Southside, Eastside
You know what they say on tha West Coast
Too many gangstas on tha same beach
Black Dickies
And a white tee
Soulja Ree’s

[BOOSIE TALKING TO THE END]
