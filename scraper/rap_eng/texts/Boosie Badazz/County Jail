[Intro: Lil Boosie]
I'mma send this out to the motherfuckin' struggle I had nigga
Down on a note, I'm broke
Real talk

[Hook x2: Lil Boosie]
I used to be sittin' in a county jail
Who can I call on when it's goin' all wrong?
Ain't no one to call for help
Please God (help me help me help me)
I need help

[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
30 days, 60 days in this motherfuckin' cage
No one to call on when it's going all wrong
Petty charges, weed charges, car charge
Man I need a lawyer
Dead in debt I money loan, plus I need a father
Cousin hurt me, took a loss where he can't help me neither
So I fall on the line, tearin' it down, thuggin' like it's legal
See quick my people and we at the same situation
A couple grand I'm bring 'em home but ain't nobody on
So we like fuck it, get our pen and our piece of paper
Juice it out like fuck it, it gon get greater later
Beat on the table, make the beat and put the rhyme on top
Wishin' the judge would show some love so we can grind the block
I hit my dog, I need some change up in comacery here
I'm a keep it real I need some shoes and some soups (I'm hungry)
Writtin' letters to my girl, hoping she don't meet a friend
Hoping she keep that pussy tight till nigga back again

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae The Truth]
I'm in the state county, all time still awaiting my sentence
Day after day it's out the cell like it's [?]
My pride the business but my freedom got me sick
Ain't nothing live about drinking water on top of where these niggas shit
Inside the world I'm still a man but in here I'm a number
Called in collect but ain't nobody accepting this number
Screaming at my cellie, tell him catch me at the freeway
Hit the niggas from the block so we can get the latest street play
They call in Chao and they knowin' fool trash
I rather go in on a spread, I kick niggas across they ass
One of my childhood niggas just caught the chain for 30
Had a chance for an appeal but he fucked it from playing dirty
I seen it all, it's the same pussy niggas [?]
So I'm mindin' my own hopin' county release my ho
Go in the wreck, playing weights sweatin' and come home swole
Fuck off the week until Wednesday, waitin' on damage control

[Hook]
