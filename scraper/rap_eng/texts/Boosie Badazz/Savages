[Verse 1]
Look, they took interviews and they flipped 'em on me
Still I rise
They threw crosses between me and my closest homie Webbie
But the shit ain't fly
They asked critics if I did it or ain't did it
What they doin', they searchin' for lies
Dirt on my name, they hurt me inside
What a hell of a tide
I'm feelin' like Koly, my heart cold as a bitch
I was raised in the streets
Lot of nights couldn't sleep, it was deep on my street
I had to prey on the weak
Nigga got loose and a nigga left his head in the street
Now he dead in the street
No shit, we don't go for that ho shit 'round here
Can't be scared on my street
They'll bust your head on the street
If you want beef, dead nigga
All of my niggas are savages, huh
Have you dead by the weekend nigga
I'm tatted up all on my sleeve
Made me risk it then I run to the weed
My cousin found guilty of murder, it's Murder
It's murder, more murder, we raised up in murder

[Chorus]
All of my niggas are savages
All of my niggas are savages
All of my niggas, man all of my niggas
Man all of my niggas are savages
They shoot at you first on that casket shit
All of my niggas are savages
Nigga we don't play that, so I gotta say that
All my niggas are savages

[Verse 2]
Free my nigga D-Bo
And every real nigga that I left thuggin' on the D-row
Move and Lil Fleek my savages
All of my bulls be savages
I must admit that I run with them goons
We know it's inside, we gon' run in the room
We beefin' in May then we comin' for June
My lil niggas don't mind, they do it all the time (homework nigga)
This for my thugs doin' time
Who ready to rumble again
Who ready to jump for the pen
Shit, we ready for Bronson again
Black S shoot a nigga neck
Shit get real if you really wanna take it there
Ruger Ruger Ruger Ruger Ruger red
Ruger Ruger Ruger Ruger Ruger red
Same nigga ain't talk when we hit a safe
We all get money, bitch we all shine
Somethin' jump off, we gon' all ride
Love my hood bitch, South Side

[Chorus]
All of my niggas are savages
All of my niggas are savages
All of my niggas, man all of my niggas
Man all of my niggas are savages
They shoot at you first on that casket shit
All of my niggas are savages
Nigga we don't play that, so I gotta say that
All my niggas are savages

[Verse 3]
If you know a nigga locked up, boxed up
Put your hood up, free all my savages
Free all my savages, free all my savages
We don't go for that ho shit 'round here nigga
We'll show shit 'round here nigga
Shit all my niggas got extensions 'round here boy
Rest in peace to my savages
We all gotta die, we savages
Rest in peace to my savages
We all gotta die, we savages
We ride or we die, we savages
Rest in peace to my savages
Tattoos for my savages
Tatted up 'cause my savages

[Chorus]
All of my niggas are savages
All of my niggas are savages
All of my niggas, man all of my niggas
Man all of my niggas they savages
Hit you up in traffic bitch
All of my niggas get nasty bitch
They pull it up on you in traffic with it
All my niggas are savages
