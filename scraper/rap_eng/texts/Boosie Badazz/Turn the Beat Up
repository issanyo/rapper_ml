(In university)
I swing and I beat off the block (Boosie)
6, 3
Sike girk (now it's Dorrough Music)
These niggas be claimin' they real
Most of these niggas are not
See I'm from the land of the thrill
My nigga, we get to the guap
Rollin' and blowin' on kill
As soon as I pull out the lot
Flippin' and grippin' the wheel
I swing and I beat off the block
I swing and I beat off the block
I swing and I beat off the block
'Cause I'm from the land of the thrill
I swing and I beat off the block
Rollin' and blowin' on kill
I swing and I beat off the block
Flippin' and grippin' the wheel
I swing and I beat off the block
I swing and I beat off the block
Ride around town, clear night
I swing and I beat off the block
No tellin' where I'm goin', boy I'm hot
I swing and I beat off the block
You know I'm watchin' now full of ops
I swing and I beat off the block
Turn your heads every time I ride by
I swing and I beat off the block
Bitches and niggas be thinkin' they know me
They be like how is this niggas so famous and still be remainin' so low-key
They way they be lookin' and watchin' me, and stalkin me
I swear they be worser than them police
I do what I wanna do, like it or not, I'm a stinger this back from the OG
Sooner or later you prolly will realize that I am the one who is hot
Most of these niggas are phony
And if you don't know it yet I am the one who is not
Say what you wanna say, do what you wanna do
I'ma do me while I get to this guap
Matter fact, soon as I pull out the lot
I'ma speed off and go beat up the block
Look how I ride, round with a toaster, niggas are vultures
Taking out legal, probin' the culture
People be lurking I thought I told you
Way too much paper, I need a folder
Nigga destroy ya, I need a lawyer
Nigga be scheemin', slicker than all you
Lil' momma think I be grillin' this for you
I know you gotta be tighter than this
These niggas be claimin' they real
Most of these niggas are not
See I'm from the land of the thrill
My nigga, we get to the guap
Rollin' and blowin' on kill
As soon as I pull out the lot
Flippin' and grippin' the wheel
I swing and I beat off the block
I swing and I beat off the block
I swing and I beat off the block
'Cause I'm from the land of the thrill
I swing and I beat off the block
Rollin' and blowin' on kill
I swing and I beat off the block
Flippin' and grippin' the wheel
I swing and I beat off the block
I swing and I beat off the block
Er'body know I swing and I beat off the block
My girl roll up the kush, we high nah, I beat up the twat
He say he gangsta, but you know you not
Because you told the cops when you got shot so you walked out
Land of the thrill, mayne that's my spot
Workin' that real up in my twat
(System label me, a killa 'cause Lil Boosie gettin' guap)
(Blood cry on you) pussy rookies, yo kush ain't even kushin'
Talkin' like you on but searchin' for a fortune cookies
So shiny, fresh off the pinter, I'm on top
Send you river checking dudes by the girk, girl stop
Rolls Royce pull out that lot, 24', my trunk on knot
I swerve and no one get own my lane scurr
These niggas be claimin' they real
Most of these niggas are not
See I'm from the land of the thrill
My nigga, we get to the guap
Rollin' and blowin' on kill
As soon as I pull out the lot
Flippin' and grippin' the wheel
I swing and I beat off the block
I swing and I beat off the block
I swing and I beat off the block
'Cause I'm from the land of the thrill
I swing and I beat off the block
Rollin' and blowin' on kill
I swing and I beat off the block
Flippin' and grippin' the wheel
I swing and I beat off the block
I swing and I beat off the block
Ride around town, clear night
I swing and I beat off the block
No tellin' where I'm goin', boy I'm hot
I swing and I beat off the block
You know I'm watchin' now full of ops
I swing and I beat off the block
Turn your head every time I ride by
I swing and I beat off the block
