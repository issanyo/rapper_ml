Lil Boosie bad azz, trill entertainment, yung savage
From the streetz to da beatz baby
Bend over lemme see whutchu workin wid fa real look
Ay tell'em we need 10, 000 ones in the corner
If you ain't doin it big you ain't doin it right

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Bend over let me see it girl
Make you wait on the pole when you hit the floor
Make it go boom boom boom boom boom boom

Bend over let me see it girl
Lookin so much like a apple I'm a bite it baby

Fill ya ankles up with money make you feel special
From the bed to the dresser let me undress you
