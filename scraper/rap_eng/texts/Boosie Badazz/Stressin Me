Like I said on rap city nigga
I can't complain

She keep on stressin me (she keep on stressin me)
But he keep on blessin me (yea, he keep on bleesin me)
Niggas wanna kill me (niggas wanna kill me)
But im protected by his fears
So death I dont fear..

Through all the struggles (mannnn)
Through all the pain (say that)
Through all the rumors god still blessin boosie (fuckin right)
Fuck a nigga god protected lil boosie
Will a pussy nigga shoot me his spirit'll bullet proof me
Bless many things I dreamed bout when I was small
99 problems but he helped me get through em all (realll)
Keep me healthy so I can get through to ya
Every night I thank god im a super star
Through all the murders, through all the jail time
Coulda been indicted nigga kept it real ?lane? line
Long nights on the blocks, hands full of rocks
He was that feeling tell ya take it in lil nigga
She knoe he gettin money, so tell me why she trippin
She just dont know bookoo hoes won't be up in her position
Got a nigga stressed out (I ain't worried)
Gettin 15 gs stay swervin..

She keep on stressin me (she keep on stressin me)
But he keep on blessin me (yea, he keep on bleesin me)
Niggas wanna kill me (niggas wanna kill me)
But im protected by his fears
So death i dont fear..

I know he blessed me this christmas
Gunna have a happy new year
With all my family and my niggas
Bread done got thicker, thanks to him
God dont let em walk down on me like soulja slim
A 100 thousand the first month, you know its him
This watch, this chain, this bracelet
God gone make me go for them
Bitch I play a ?butterem?
Bad bitches lovin him
These streets ain't the place for me
Police tryin to put a case on me
But god see that we all created equal
Some hustle harder then others
Regardless we all brothers
Just come from different mothers
Niggas I used to fuck with are ?now me now?
Got me thinkin to myself is they gunna try me now
I called that, three hemis and a couple old schools
I make a nigga bring that drama to ya whole crew
They want my hand in my lap, lay me down
I stay strapped with 50 rounds
And its goin down..

She keep on stressin me (she keep on stressin me)
But he keep on blessin me (yea, he keep on bleesin me)
Niggas wanna kill me (niggas wanna kill me)
But im protected by his fears
So death i dont fear..
