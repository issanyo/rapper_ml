Intro:]
Lil nigga, lil nigga (for my), lil nigga (for my)
Lil nigga, lil nigga, lil nigga with a big ole pistol

[Verse 1:]
Four deep in a cut dawg, with a big ole pistol
We don't drive-by, we walk by, we tiptoe niggas
A Glock and a fo'-five will kill fo' niggas
Fuck yo niggas, my niggas cut throat niggas, believe that
Dead niggas, dead bitches, this is homicide
And I want know who gon ride for that south side
I bleed pain, take pain to another level
The last nigga got burnt fuckin with my chedda
Too much weed and codein fucked up my attitude
Any nigga in my way, I put this gat on you
I speak the truth, not a booth that's my best friend
It keep beatin and his other friends comin in
Blowin money ain't shit so I'm quick to spit
And you know I'm hollin' self defense
Since Ivy got killed, it's been serious
I ain't smilin with no nigga, I'm puttin that pop on a nigga
Baton Rouge sick with it
This shit ain't a game boy, shoulda stayed on yo game boy
These streets ain't a game boy, I knock out ya frame boy
My niggas ain't playin boy
They slanging iron behind this building

[Hook:]
This for my lil nigga, lil nigga, lil nigga
With a big ole pistol
Where my lil nigga with more heart than Jesus
Here I go (Bad Azz), here I go (Bad Azz), here I go
For my lil nigga, lil nigga, lil nigga
With a big ole pistol
Where my lil nigga with more heart than Jesus
Here I go (Bad Azz), here I go (Bad Azz), here I go

[Verse 2:]
Loco turn me up this kickin in
You can disrespect my mind and feel this mack-10
Black phantom full of hoes, bitch we knock off bosses
Catch ya issue around here, we don't take no losses
Niggas pickin on a lil nigga, words from a real nigga
Get ya steel nigga, and deal with em
For that lil nigga up the road up in beast mode
Don't win em all but everytime that lil nigga roll
One shot from my cousin Donkey, that lil nigga cold
He ain't gon sugar coat shit, he gon let em go
Pyru you betta let em know where I was raised at
I'm just a ghetto child tryin to make it
'fore they take me, mamaaa
I'm sorry for the pain I brung, but
Niggas out here tryna kill ya son
So I gotta keep it, fuck the 5, I can beat it
Why them lil niggas out here tryna beefin

[Hook:]
Lil nigga, lil nigga, lil nigga
With a big ole pistol
Where my lil nigga with more heart than Jesus
Here I go (Bad Azz), here I go (Bad Azz), here I go
For my lil nigga, lil nigga, lil nigga
With a big ole pistol
Where my lil nigga with more heart than Jesus
Here I go (Bad Azz), here I go (Bad Azz), here I go

[Verse 3:]

Project livin, ain't neva had a daddy
Quick ta bust ya head, and take the rims off ya Caddy
Lil niggas got them hoes, lil niggas keep a roll
Lil niggas still lil niggas even when they old
Lil Bleek, Lil Junior, Bad Azz, ice cold
Threesomes everynight, fuck it, let the dice roll
They like boosie, betta talk to em they kickin up dust
Niggas robbin all the cells, got the hood fucked up
Shiiit, wat Ima tell 'em I was in they situation
Jack a bitch with no hesitation, bare-faced nigga
If ya small ya gotta have a big heart
Don't take no shorts, niggas take it too far
Lil niggas 'cross the world, you know who ya are
Stand up for ya rights, put that thang in they life, boom

[Hook:]
Lil nigga, lil nigga, lil nigga

Here I go (Bad Azz), here I go (Bad Azz), here I go
For my lil nigga, lil nigga, lil nigga
