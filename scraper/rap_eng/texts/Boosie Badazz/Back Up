Trill Entertainment nigga mic check, Webbie and Boosie
Ya heard me, this how its goin down nigga, check it out
Back up bitch, back up bitch, back up
C'mon, trill entertainment
Yo hood can't fuck with mine

[WEBBIE]
Now I know, that you ain't really bout that shit that you be talkin' about
And you be just runnin' ya mouth but you'll get knocked out and
Drug out the club house we thugged out
Showin' off with yo thugs, me and my thugs'll make yo thugs bounce
I, suggest that you respect it
Disrespect I'll have to check it and when I check it gets hectic
You don't want no savage doin' no damage to yo section
While I fuck yo baby mama, she say fuck my baby daddy
If a nigga wants some static let em have that's the G-Code
Since 94' I been throwed up in beast mode
Street life is all I know, sellin' yo money, cars and clothes
Rubber real don't fuck with hoes, unload and reload
We G's y'all hoes, y'all ain't ready to swang with us
Since youngstas growin' up y'all people wouldn't let y'all hang with us
Your people prolly told you don't play with guns boy they dangerous
My peeps don't play with guns they stay with guns and I slangin em

Now when I enter this bitch I was ready to get off in me some shit
Cause I love my hood and I'mma represent in this bitch
Now in the parking lot, I had that 40 Glock ready
That gin gon' keep me hype when I be watchin' over Webbie
In my city AP9's and Smith and Wessons
Thugs who second guessin' them the ones who be restin'
God gave me a blessing, told me get the crowd crunk
Say Boo don't change yo style give the crowd what they want (look)
Now I'm that rumble in the jungle, 2004 Hummer stunna
My momma, she still wonder why her son's a young gunner
Back back, back back, get out my way let me mob
All that bumpin' into niggas played out in 95'

I see y'all actin nigga, oh yeah y'all act a fool
Better stop that actin lil' savage'll beat you black and blue
I been abused you gotta excuse my attitude
Plus I been smokin' hy-dro and drinkin' yak and brews
I been a fool out here packin' tools since middle school
I been a fool I had the most loot up in the school
A phone book of referrals, I ain't follow no rules
Be quiet in class, don't act bad, raise ya hand was ho rules
I skipped the class and act a ass and sold some crack to white dudes
Between class smoked Kools and big blunts before school
Straight up menace, got a nigga glad I ain't go to your school
Played them hoes, I woulda played you like a ho too
That's that boy I don't like, he start fights everywhere he goes to
But proudly I don't give a fuck, try me I'll fight you
Hold up back up a bit you fuckin' up my white shoes
Alright I asked you once, BITCH MOVE!
