[Intro: Jeezy & Boosie Badazz]
Yeeeah!
Boosie Badazz, uh-huh

[Chorus: Future & DJ Khaled]
I said all these niggas fuck niggas
And they said they fuck wit' you (fuck 'em)
But really they don't fuck wit' you (don't trust 'em)
So I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em (DJ Khaled)
And so I bought the Wraith on 'em (Wraith boys)
I still got the paper plates on 'em (money boy)
And if you think I'm playin' wit' you
I'll ride on you niggas (I'll ride on you)
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
(It's We The Best Music)
I'll ride on you niggas, so I advise you not to fuck wit' em

[Verse 1: Boosie Badazz]
Boosie Badazz
Boosie Mandela, I am the people's choices
We can take it there, but I take it much farther
Dude you don't know me, so you can't drink my bottle
Why when I was gone you ain't do nothing for my daughter?
Paper plate-living, niggas hating cause I'm ballin'
Boring his bitch, fucked her and spoiled
You don't wanna see me all I do is make a call
We have no specific victims, we want all y'all
Ridin' for the team, .45 wit' a beam
Plenty murder scenes so I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em
G-O-R-I-double-L-A
It's levels to this shit like my nigga Meek say
DJ Khaled, look

[Chorus: Future]
I said all these niggas fuck niggas
And they said they fuck wit' you
But really they don't fuck wit' you
So I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em
And so I bought the Wraith on 'em
I still got the paper plates on 'em
And if you think I'm playing wit' you
I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, so I advise you not to fuck wit' em

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
All the bad bitches' real niggas holler when we enter
Sky dweller looking like chilly in the winter
Twelve gauge Mossberg, that bitch look like a chopper
If my dawg burst so I hand it to my partner
Heat game chip bitch I'm chilling on the floor
All white hit the door looking like a kilo
Ice machine refrigerator nigga what the hell
What they said about my watch when I spoke to Gabriel
Cash on the Wraith so this shit is not a lease
Hundred cash on the Cuban fuck I need with a piece
Catch you in the streets knock your top off like a Jeep
Then we show up at your funeral and piss all on your wreath
Ride on 'em

[Chorus: Future]
I said all these niggas fuck niggas
And they said they fuck wit' you
But really they don't fuck wit' you
So I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em
And so I bought the Wraith on 'em
I still got the paper plates on 'em
And if you think I'm playing wit' you
I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, so I advise you not to fuck wit' em

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Betting on a nigga I'ma go and get it
And if I set it on a nigga you can bet that I'ma go and hit it
These the laws that we live by
Same niggas that you're looking at the ones you getting slit by
Still moving how I wanna
For a brick, whole clique getting left in a coma
White glove it's a deadly game
You gon' fuck, top down say my name like Candyman
All I want is real estate
Graduated from the corner 'til I send it up the interstate
Niggas hating on me
But I got a new plug and it got a truck waiting on me

[Chorus: Future]
I said all these niggas fuck niggas
And they said they fuck wit' you
But really they don't fuck wit' you
So I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em
And so I bought the Wraith on 'em
I still got the paper plates on 'em
And if you think I'm playing wit' you
I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, so I advise you not to fuck wit' em
