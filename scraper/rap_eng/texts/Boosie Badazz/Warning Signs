[Intro]
Boosie Badazz
Real shit

[Verse 1]
Since I was a lil’ nigga, this dude was my homie
Cops on the corner, he the one who will warn me
Never showed the lead, but my momma say he phony
I’m giving her the look like “yeah right, that’s my homie”
Years past by made my money grew bigger
Now these niggas in your head “what they done to you, nigga?”
I’ll smack one of these niggas right in front of you, nigga
Thick or thin, life of sin, I stood up for you, nigga
I’m like “damn, this nigga tripping now”
Caught this nigga’s hand stealing out the pot
I’m like “damn dog, this nigga must forgot”
My nigga then, my nigga then if he got or not

[Hook 1]
Momma always warned me of busters
She say they’ll get you killed or have you wearing orange colors
Don’t put your faith in man, he will fail you every time
Don’t put your faith in man, he will fail you every time, son
Momma always warned me of busters
She say they’ll get you killed or have you wearing orange colors
Don’t put your faith in man, he will fail you every time
Put your faith in man, he will fail you every time, son

[Verse 2]
My momma always warned me ‘bout these niggas and these bitches
Told me plenty times how these niggas turn to snitches
Told me plenty times how these bitches want your riches
Game played, mistakes made, damn, I should’ve listened
Her words came cold, so I felt like she was tripping
She told me “you gon’ learn the hard way”, I’m reminiscing
Will I listen to what the lord say, fuck it, go and flip ‘em
She told me slow my role not one time, but like a million
She brought it out the light, what was in the dark?
Told me about Polk, I’m like OG’s don’t talk to you
Looking at that black and white paper in the dark
And this nigga just explained “I’ma kill her” with no heart

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3]
It’s like we can’t see it sometime, but momma be on it
We don’t want it to be true, we’re just enjoying the moment
We don’t really know who phony ‘til the phony go phony
And Momma words flash back when that phony your homie
Niggas talk behind computers, but they really don’t want it
“Shouldn’t have gave that nigga shit, son”, you’re right about that
Girl, we used to rock tough, live life like that
Old buster ass bitch couldn’t even write me back

[Hook 2]
Momma always warned me of busters
She say they’ll get you killed or have you wearing orange colors
Don’t put your faith in man, he will fail you every time
Don’t put your faith in man, he will fail you every time, son
Momma always warned me of busters
She say they’ll get you killed or have you wearing orange colors
Momma always warned me of busters
Momma always warned me of busters

[Verse 4]
Fuck it, this the fourth verse, this shit will make my heart hurt
When the nigga who you really love end your paperwork
I got some niggas gone who used to move my paperwork
Early morning up, going and getting it, moving major work
I’ve seen niggas gunsmoke their own brothers
I’ve seen niggas steal from their baby mothers
Nigga changed in the rain when you no longer ball
How you gon’ make niggas real who ain’t real at all?
Same nigga you’re at the mall doing your thing with
Snaking on the cool and he trying to get your main bitch
Buster ass nigga, you ain’t nothing I want to hang with or talk to
Look you gon’ stay from ‘round me and I’m gon’ stay from ‘round you
Buster ass nigga
