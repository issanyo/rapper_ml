[BRIDGE]
Nobody wanna see me smile
They only wanna see me down
Nobody wanna see me smile
They only wanna see me down
Oh lawd

[VERSE 1]
Nobody know tha son I got (Lil Tootie)
Nobody know tha bond we got
Shit nobody know tha mom I got
Not too many know I smile a lot
And cry a lot
I have no problem wit’ gays
I have no problem wit’ Jay
I do have problems wit’ people who twist the words that I say
My city blame me for people who I never beefed wit’ at all
They watch my crew like we gon’ steal
When we up in tha mall
You say you know me
But do you know
I’ll ride for my dawg
I’ll spend my last dime
To put a smile on my dawg
You say I’m mean
That’s just a look I got
That make you suspicious
You judgin’ like bitches
I’m in love wit’ my riches
Now bitches
If you say I lied bout havin’ cancer up in my kidney

[HOOK]
You don’t know me like that
I judge a hustla how he hustle
I judge a lover how she love ya
You judge a book by its cover
Pussy boy
You don’t know me like that
I got no problem wit’ gays
I got no problem wit’ Jay
You twist the words that I say
Gutta bitch
You don’t know me like that

[VERSE 2]
So stop tha talkin’
You couldn’t walk in these shoes
That I’m walkin’
And that’s a fact
You wonder why you don’t see me too often
It’s cuz of that
Never gave me no love
But expect for me to give it back
Just cuz that boy ain’t no thug
Don’t mean that boy gon’ turn rat
Most time tha nigga who slugged up
Take down tha whole pack
Trayvon Martin had on black and a hoodie
White bitch thought he was a man of war
But in his hand
He had a juice, and a candy bar
Yeah they take it far
I guess wit’ no jewelry on
I look like tha type to take a car
I let my hair grow wild and crazy
I guess I’m tha type to rape a broad
Judgin’ tha struggle I got
Thinkin’ I like a certain type of women
Cuz the baby mother’s I got
But

[HOOK]
You don’t know me like that
I judge a hustla how he hustle
I judge a lover how she love ya
You judge a book by its cover
Pussy boy
You don’t know me like that
I got no problem wit’ gays
I got no problem wit’ Jay
You twist the words that I say
Gutta bitch
You don’t know me like that

[BRIDGE]
Nobody wanna see me smile
They only wanna see me down
Nobody wanna see me smile
They only wanna see me down
Oh lawd

[OUTRO]
You wanna be me
You couldn’t imagine
So many muthafuckas lyin’
You wanna be me
You couldn’t imagine
So many muthafuckas judgin’
It’s ugly
When people talk
But they don’t know you like that
