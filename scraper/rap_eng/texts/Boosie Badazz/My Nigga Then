[Hook x2]
If you my nigga, you my nigga then
We stick together thick and then
That's my nigga then
My nigga then

[Verse 1]
This for my nigga, my round, my wodie, my killa, my thug, my nigga, my love
My cock it back ready to bust
Since we was small, look you was around nigga
You don't pay cause I took the charge cause I'm down nigga
When we was broke, we cocked it back and we was blastin'
Wgen we could smoke, we pulled off with yo sacks, laughin'
If we get chose
We goin' on the same line
Boxin' at the same time
You my thug and I ain't lyin'
Let me fuck yo main line
You don't cherish it
When beef kicked off
You the first one hollerin' bury this
Look, I'll tell ya this
If u cross em' I'm gon' bank a bitch
If 4 niggas go on this lick, 2 of them ain't gon' get shit
My wodie, my round, my vick
Kick our door together
We pull out bread and score together
Go to the head to blow together
Un-click it, ain't no level my potnah, my friend
If yo high don't kick in
I'll give you my last shot of gin
Look

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
And when I clip ya
You ain't gotta pay me shit
One of our dawgs go sour
You holler, "We can take the click"
Thug love made us thick
That's why we roll solo
Smoke Doe Doe, drink Hen like hot cocoa, while hoes pop a photo
Was down bad with no goal for some cash
You watch out while I hid the stash
I'm gon' give you half
And jump on the slab hopin' today they make me boss
We come up together so it ain't shit to take a loss
On yo chest, take it off, and we gon' handle that
Collect calls or answer that
Yo 'belle a handle that
Look, I cock and bust with this nigga
Get full of that dust with this nigga
Drop my nuts with this nigga
Cause I got love for this nigga
Put my trust in this nigga
He ain't never sold out
Hollerin' fuck all that chillin' mane let's cut down a whole house
He know what them 4's bout
Take my side, right or wrong
If you my nigga you my nigga we gon' ride till you gone

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Kevin Thomas my nigga then
KB, Carvis Webb, better known as Lil Trell, that's my nigga then
I shoot that iron with this nigga
Do that time with this nigga
Might toot a line with this nigga
On my mind with this nigga
Jump in that water with this nigga
Kidnap yo daughter with this nigga
Be at the remodel with this nigga
Smokin' falls with this nigga
Used to be down bad with this nigga, slangin' that herb
Now we ridin' on leather up in this seat, sippin' syrup
Put it in yo life with this nigga
Jump on this wife with this nigga
I shoot kites with this nigga
I'd lose my life for this nigga
I start wars with this nigga
Pop up cars with this nigga
Duck the law with this nigga
Play it raw with this nigga
Smoke on keys with this nigga
I hold G's for this nigga
I just stole D's with this nigga
Bet not beef with this nigga
Cause I'd creep with this nigga
That's on my pop
If you beefin' with him boy you beefin' with me, off the top
Look
