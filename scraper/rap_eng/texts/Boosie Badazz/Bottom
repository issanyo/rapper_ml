[Intro]
On the bottom
On the bottom
Michail on the beat

[Verse 1]
One at the foot, two at the head, my nigga
One ain't shut up, one peed the bed, my nigga (Shut the fuck up)
Burglaries, that's what fed my niggas (Yeah)
Bottom of the fuckin' map, that's what bred my niggas
I'm talkin' peanut butter, jelly
Go and fuck a bitch at the thirty-nine dollar telly (Telly)
And score a pack
Quick to lend a real friend 'cause I know he gon' pay it back
If I slip, I know he gon' kill a rat (Bang)
Hard for us to stack
'Cause a nigga need hoes and clothes (Yeah)
Playin' bingo with my hand when I saw me a rose
Now lil' Boosie, he the man, and I drive me a Rolls
Top dawg, county boy, he gon' blow
I want the whole world to know

[Chorus]
No one can stop what God got for you, nigga (No one can stop what God got)
No one can stop what God got for you, nigga (No one can stop what God got)
No one can stop what God got for you, nigga
No one can stop what God got for you, nigga (Where we from?)
From the bottom, mayne (Where we from, nigga?)
From the bottom, mayne (Yeah)
From the bottom, mayne (Yay-yay)
'Til the final thang, mayne

[Verse 2]
Couple hits, now I'm hot, with them sticks in the drop, wildin' out
Goin' seventy (Go all out, go all out)
No more bricks, bitch, I rap and I'm on
All my niggas comin' home (Free my cousin' crossin' on)
Niggas told me, "Get your money, motherfuck" (In that five)
Protect your bag, shoot a hundred, motherfucker (Yeah, get that bag)
I was really raised the hard way (Hard way)
If I ain't had it, I would take your Penny Hardaway (Penny Hardaway)
I had fame, cancer came, I had harder days (Oh Lord)
I thought 'bout runnin' from parole and throwin' it all away (Oh Lord)
Me and OG Dre sat on the couch and smoked a pound a day (Ayy)
Who ever thought I'd have a sack to smoke a pound a day (Real)

[Chorus]
No one can stop what God got for you, nigga (No one can stop what God got)
No one can stop what God got for you, nigga (No one can stop what God got)
No one can stop what God got for you, nigga
No one can stop what God got for you, nigga (Where we from?)
From the bottom, mayne (Where we from, nigga?)
From the bottom, mayne (Yeah)
From the bottom, mayne (Yay-yay)
'Til the final thang, mayne

[Outro]
No one can stop what God got for you, nigga
It ain't where you from, it's where you goin'
Same people talk about you, one day soon, they will copy you, nigga
When them diamonds hit your neck and you start glowin'
Then I got on the radio
Now they wanna do the rodeo
They say, his hood-ass always talkin' 'bout head
'Cause in the hood, it ain't about the pussy
But that you get the bitch head
It's that bottom
