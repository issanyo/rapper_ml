[Intro]
By the river
By the river
Boosie Badazz
In a little tent
I was born by the river
True story
In a little tent
Oh, and just like the river
I been runnin' ever since
I was born by the river
In a little tent
Oh, and just like the river
I been runnin' ever since
I was born

[Verse 1]
By the river, in a place full of wrong
Poverty stricken living is a place I call home
Runnin' from the bird and the pen, broken loss
Small house, low on cover so me and my brother fought
We would fight all the time, first gunshots was scared
We would hit the floor
Got used to 'em, now them gunshots would turn to jokes
Remember eighty-eight, when we first saw snow
Grew up hopin' to travel so we could see that once more
(I was born), with a chip on my shoulder, and an attitude
With a clip in my holster livin' in Baton Rouge
Where haters get duct-taped, friends testify
If you make it to see 25 you're satisfied, oh lord

[Chorus]
Born by the river
In a little tent
Oh, and just like the river
I been runnin' ever since
I was born by the river
True story
In a little tent
Oh, and just like the river
I been runnin' ever since
I was born

[Verse 2]
House packed with the fam but we didn't notice
Hope they leave the house tonight, who? the cockroaches
Mama stressin' so it's hard to tell her stop smokin'
Cousins Glock totin', man, daddy rock smokin'
Came up, a lot of people changed up
World of the fam 'cause the bands ain't changed us
We was born with a coke spoon, that silver shit was dreams to us
Grew up servin' my uncles 'cause that's what green do
Puff the loud, close my eyes, and dream
From a family full of players, hustlers, felons, and fiends, man
Coming up, I watched plenty get they money long
Same niggas start lacin', now they money gone

[Chorus]
Born by the river
In a little tent
Oh, and just like the river
I was born by the river
I been runnin' ever since
I was born by the river
Miss Muley turkey wing
In a little tent
Oh, and just like the river
Boosie Badazz
I been runnin' ever since
I was

[Bridge]
Born by the river
I was born by the river
And my mama cried when my daddy died, by the river
Where you got your first piece of pussy at? by the river
I was born by the river
I was born by the river
And my mama cried when my daddy died, by the river
When I was young my whole family stayed by the river
I was born in a hurry, I was born in a hurry
'Cause my mama had to be at work by 8:30
In a hurry, doctor hurry, by the river

[Chorus]
Born by the river
In a little tent
Oh, and just like the river
I been runnin' ever since
I was born by the river
In a little tent
Oh, and just like the river
I been runnin' ever since
I was born

[Outro]
Born, in a hurry
