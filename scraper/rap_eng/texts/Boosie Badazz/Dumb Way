Brotherly love

[Hook]
If it ain’t one thing it’s another
If it ain’t another bad bitch it’s ma brother
It’s gon be the dumb way
Everytime we coming
The dumb way riding dirty like pimp [?]
One thing it’s another
If it ain’t another bad bitch it’s ma brother
It’s gon be the dumb way
Everytime we coming
The dumb way riding dirty like pimp [?]

[Verse 1]
Look time flies when you doing time don’t it bih
I ain’t lying homie bih, dem bitches wanted me
I had kept the math first i capped a [?] first
It had all fucked me up cause you know i started getting bands first
Catch you when you ain’t at work
Can’t you see how your hands work
Catch you when your old man gone
Get to you and make that ass twerk

Slow down, you know when it’s fire then you know it’s gotta go Round
Y’all know when y’all tried then some shit gonna go down
Came straight from the bottom i mean low down
And if you didn’t know then, then you know now

[Hook]
If it ain’t one thing it’s another
If it ain’t another bad bitch it’s ma brother

Everytime we coming
The dumb way riding dirty like pimp [?]
One thing it’s another
If it ain’t another bad bitch it’s ma brother
It’s gonna be the dumb way
Everytime we coming
The dumb way riding dirty like pimp [?]
