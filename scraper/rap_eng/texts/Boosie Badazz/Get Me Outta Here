[Intro]
Get me outta here
Look like another hot summer
Get me outta here
Looking like another cold Christmas
Get me outta here
Easter no better
My fucking mama want me home
Get me outta here
Sue my people in the pen

[Verse 1]
They just gave Lil Johnny 40 years
Tryna take his life
Question is, in a don will he play the night
Big Nick nicks he fighting the L
He go to court tomorrow
Cold defendant, public defender
He ain't show tomorrow
Big Joe just come from court
Couldn't even hug his daughter
Got a black box like me
A cold court harder
Fu Fu on stabbing shit
He on some real nasty shit
It's hard to get back on court
Cuz they don't believe it was an accident
Hear Joe he say he coming home ragging shit
Turn up with a white girl he said he coming home cabling
I left the streets they got ghosts
I was so mad 'bout this
My troubles half the world would laugh 'bout this
I used to call Donk on the line

[Hook]
Get me outta here
Get me outta here
Get me outta here
Get me outta here

[Verse 2]
Don't want hear nobody dying
Don't wanna feel that kind of vibe
Don't wanna feel that kind of vibe
What's going on tell me what's going on
I used to call Donk on the line
Ain't even wrong nothing on the line
I just wanna hear you nigga smile and laugh
Where I'm going out tonight
I'm 'bout to close my eyes and join in yeah
I won't go home I mean tonight
And do some extra sea in California
Supermodel bitches next to me in California
And the kitchen doors dope dreaming California
I woke cocaine on the line

[Hook]
Get me outta here
Get me outta here
Get me outta here

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna here nobody dying
I just wanna here about your shine
She say he ain't pick up the line
She say he won't pick up the line
I said mama call Jason one more time
Leave him message tell him I need to talk
Leave him message say I'm trying to go off the wall
I need his blessing I'm gonna call one more time
I call my lawyer all the time
What up Jason what up till this day he still my dog
Never gonna forget the day March the fifth 2014
When the people let me out I told my Dre

[Outro]
Man I'm tired I wanna go home
Get me outta here
I'll go home and sex my lady
Get me outta here
Lately I've been fighting a storm
Get me outta here
My child she battle with her daddy
Get me outta here
I wake up playing search home
Get me outta here
I just lost my old lady
Get me outta here
You ain't even come see me in jail
Get me outta here
Look like another hot summer
Get me outta here
Look like another cold Christmas
Get me outta here
Easter no better
Get me outta here
You send up your last letter
Get me outta here
In this place I don't wanna die
Get me outta here
Look like another hot summer
