[Intro]
(Now) If you love your nigga, hug your nigga (hug your nigga)
Look them dead in the eye (dead in the eye)
And tell your nigga
Tell that nigga you love them (you love your nigga)

[Verse]
We started out smoking weed in the park
Visine in our eyes, trying make it home 'fore dark
Flipping off the clothes line, holes in our jeans
Fucking with these hoes' mind, on the trampoline
Tripping off that purple haze, trying get it off
Gotta find a junkie at the bottom mad dog
All fights was crowd fights, coming up in the streets
And even if you right or wrong, it's on, mane, its beef (off top)
I cut class with this nigga, act a ass wit this nigga
Off that hide-go-get unless them hoes sucking dick
Feeling like the shit on the first week of school
'Til your clothes run out, now you acting a fool
Remember when we first started grinding, they was giving us hell
All the OG's was hating, trying to hog all the sells
But the OG's started chosen, we busted the hood open
And my niggas, they kept a nigga rolling
I love you
