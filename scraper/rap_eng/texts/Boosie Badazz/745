[Hook (2x)]
745 (whipping things on it)
Dope boy ride (candy painting on them)
I’m so fly (I see they hating on me)
I know why (I’m getting my paper on them)

[Verse]
Seven with the 45, candy apple 45
Red seats, red stitches with two red bitches
Flip-flop pay like purple drank, oh, I think they like that
White Beemer, good smell, feeling like a polar bear
Mane, I be thugging when I ride
Let me tell you, it ain’t nothing like a 745, better get you one
Candy paint hurt they heart, got to push to start
Nigga, I ain’t hard to hard behind a fucking blind
I add a L.I. in 20, I popped so many
I lost my mind, old skinny-ass tires
Rolling through the Beemer, all the hoes sweating
Threw them things on that bitch, now my Beemer bow legged, whoa
