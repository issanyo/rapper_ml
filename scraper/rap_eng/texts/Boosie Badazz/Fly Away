[Hook: Boosie Badazz]

Sometimes I wish I could fly
So many wish they could ball
So many names on the wall
Too many gangstas on the yard
Probably the realest shit I ever wrote

[Verse 1: Boosie Badazz]

Sometimes I wanna fly away from all this money madness
But I think about it, how many people wish they fuckin' had it
Imma be all the way one hundred, miss my fuckin' daddy
Miss my nigga right now, josin', making commissary
We pack the mortuary, this life is dark and scary
You can't trust too many, gotta know who against me
I take shots of Henny, man, I need a break
I'm two steps away from clickin' 40 minutes straight
I make the real relate, real music gave back to the hood
So tell me this (nigga), how could you hate?
Slander me in the news. Press conference around my crews
Many nights I wanted to fly away and give my kids my dues
I know some niggas in the booth, wish they had ten thousand dollars
Know some niggas up in jail, wish they woulda been a scholar
Model citizen, you trippin' if you ain't feeling it
Everybody go through roller coaster rides
I miss my granny, I ain't lying

[Hook: Boosie Badazz]

Sometimes I wish I could fly
So many wish they could ball
So many names on the wall
Too many gangstas on the yard
Probably the realest shit I ever wrote

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]

Damn, that nigga wanna ball like me
Diabetes, enemies, you want it all like me
Where people take your words and twist it
On parole, still pissin'
Mad, wishin' somebody'd make some more real ass niggas
Nobody showing love. This how we growing up
Don't know if we gonna see tomorrow, this why we showing up
Better do something if you wanna ball
Yeah we do something, my niggas on call
Just looked at a picture of six niggas. Only two of us now
Your honor, I've been doing right. I don't want no trouble
P.O. I just wanna feed my family. I just wanna travel
I know you tired of goin' to college, but don't wanna tell daddy
Got a vision, but your vision come up a different alley
Of yes sir's and no sir's
As a child I wanted to fly away from junkies, Budweiser's, lies and cuss words
Got in them streets and I realized
No matter how good you gonna still die
Tears come to my eye for Bleek and Ivy
So many niggas cross the wall
Wish they could ball again
Homicide, momma cryin', they got her son again
Hurt the whole family, ripped they pride away
Little sister wanna fly away

[Hook: Boosie Badazz]

Sometimes I wish I could fly
So many wish they could ball
So many names on the wall
Too many gangstas on the yard
Probably the realest shit I ever wrote

[Verse 3: Boosie Badazz]

Can't forget my niggas who, they gave a life sentence to
Lil Joe, Dan, Mike Fleet and Moo, my penitentiary crew
I know you wanna fly away sometimes. That shit be hittin' you
Convicted as a killer, but don't let your mind be convicted too
The police killing niggas. Niggas playin' it south
Damn, that nigga killin' now. He's a fuckin' cause
Shit, put my name on the wall with them wall niggas
The two new Craigs, both hit with the flame, yeah ya'll niggas
Fly away, God help me. Luvah just lost his nephew
Still a young nigga, I left he was seven
Mookie still cryin' tears and it hurt my heart
Make you wanna fly away, when they murk ya boy
I know your pain lil' momma. You want the Hollywood lifestyle
The lights, but it's hard, cuz your from Alabama
Hurtin' inside, but smiling for the camera
Shit, so much pressure you feel like giving up

[Hook: Boosie Badazz]

Sometimes I wish I could fly
So many wish they could ball
So many names on the wall
Too many gangstas on the yard
Probably the realest shit  I ever wrote
