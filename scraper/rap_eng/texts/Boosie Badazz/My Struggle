[Intro]
Mixtape!
Boosie Boo nigga
And I be like the best nigga at this shit right now
Word for word
Life story for life story
I'm the truth

[Verse 1]
It started off in the back yard, I'm that boy
Hate to lose
If I lose you can get blues, I'm that hard
Life scarred from a bad memory, Daddy love drugs
You can't take this from him, he loved us
Went from neighborhood jackas
To neighborhood stackas
I-10 ridas, to I-10 traffickas
Imagine us in that bottom on that PCP
Walking to school with a tool, who gon' beef with me?
Got addicted to sellin' drugs, marijuana and coke
Mama she washed her hands, and let me go
The rest you know
I ain't gotta explain, I been a mane
Since I went got my own
Now they look at me grown
Posted up behind the same ol', on Wyoming Street
Big sacks, big gats, and some artillery
All the lil' niggas got big niggas, like Junior and Bleek
All the old niggas showed us ropes, like they picturin' me
Mane

[Hook x3]
You don't know my struggle, so you can't feel my hustle

[Verse 2]
The hard times, me and you getting blisted
Got a dime bag, but we couldn't buy the Philly
Walked into the weed dispenser, we was short on a special (mane)
So we got drunk, snatched purses, mane it's whatever
Old niggas try to shortstop, we ballerblocked, fuck it
Got a big knot now I'm thuggin'
With a big ugly something on my waistline
Bouncin' through the South side
Back then it was straight gin, dickies, and cowhides
You ain't from our side, we bustin' at you that's the rules
Used to be deep, now we down to just a few
Mane I'm talking bout them lonely nights
Me and my homie on the flight
Sneaking through hoes window, robbin niggas for indo
Runnin' with nothing but hard heads like Fry thing and Kevin
Going to clubs reppin', hollerin' "Fuck goin' to Heaven"
Cause I'm outchea
Look like my luck fucked up
And I done lost a lot of niggas so my trust fucked up
Mane

[Hook x3]
You don't know my struggle, so you can't feel out hustle

[Verse 3]
Sittin' nights, need my medicine and my needles
All the bondsmen, keeping it gutta with my peoples
The thug life, back to back catching misdemeanors
The drug life, serving junkies in front the cleaners
The hospitals, nurses tryna lift up my spirit
My mama preachin', but Boosie Boo don't wanna hear it (Hard-headed)
You know they said I was dead, 2 shots up in my head
Some say I OD'd off that X, what they gon' say next
Grandma died, mama house, let me talk to ya
Niggas hate, but I don't drive by, I walk to ya, high school
4 deep in the Monte Carlo
Dusted and disgusted tryna make it to tomorrow
When I borrowed, I gave back
When it was bill time, I made stacks
I-10 to 150 I shake that
The baby-mama-drama make me wanna holla
Plus I lost ass my ghetto role models, this my struggle mane
