[Chorus: Boosie Badazz]
I heard some pussy niggas lookin' for me
Make me go get them niggas cookin' for me
This shit is gangsta in this gumbo mix
Stir that gumbo with that fuckin' stick
I heard some pussy niggas lookin' for me
Make me go get them niggas cookin' for me
This shit is gangsta in this gumbo mix
Stir that gumbo with that fuckin' stick

[Verse 1: Boosie Badazz]
If you seek then you shall find, that's the code that we live by
I don't Instagram, I pull up, I'm the bad guy
Gumbo so retonto, it's so saucy that it's dangerous
We don't rap with rappers 'cause they actors, we gangstas
I don't paint no picture, I ain't puttin' on for nothin'
I give niggas issues close range, disgusting
You ain't hard to find and I ain't hard to find either
Nigga couldn't snatch me so they was tryin' to snatch neither
Turn me to that Grim Reaper, steppin' for all my people
Question me when they next to me, hopin' they keep a secret
Heard he mad 'bout his people, mixed with heron he might be lethal
I'm a dirt dog yo' bitch ass when I see you

[Chorus: Boosie Badazz]
I heard some pussy niggas lookin' for me
Make me go get them niggas cookin' for me
This shit is gangsta in this gumbo mix
Stir that gumbo with that fuckin' stick
I heard some pussy niggas lookin' for me
Make me go get them niggas cookin' for me
This shit is gangsta in this gumbo mix
Stir that gumbo with that fuckin' stick

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
In this Phantom with fullies, there's no license to carry 'em
Just some niggas like to pop you, burn yo' body, and bury 'em
Couple coupes with no roof, we ain't goin' nowhere in 'em
But to pull up and shoot, besides this bitch ain't got air in it
I got some shells for you too, I have no problem sharin' 'em
I'm just not forgivin' or forgettin' and I'm not sparin' 'em
Clean the pen and the muzzle, I put this bitch back together
I know the whole jam, I'm in trouble, that's a whole 'nother level
Like I be hangin' out the window, really really [?]
I think they gon' indict me and come get me
I do know that he died, instantly, hit him quickly
And when it's time to ride I know just who rode in with me
Ya feel me?

[Chorus: Boosie Badazz]
I heard some pussy niggas lookin' for me
Make me go get them niggas cookin' for me
This shit is gangsta in this gumbo mix
Stir that gumbo with that fuckin' stick
I heard some pussy niggas lookin' for me
Make me go get them niggas cookin' for me
This shit is gangsta in this gumbo mix
Stir that gumbo with that fuckin' stick
I heard some pussy niggas lookin' for me
Make me go get them niggas cookin' for me
This shit is gangsta in this gumbo mix
Stir that gumbo with that fuckin' stick
I heard some pussy niggas lookin' for me
Make me go get them niggas cookin' for me
This shit is gangsta in this gumbo mix
Stir that gumbo with that fuckin' stick
