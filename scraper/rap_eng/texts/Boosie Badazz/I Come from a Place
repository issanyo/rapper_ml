Boosie Badazz
Boosie Badazz nigga

[HOOK]
I come from a place
Liars and snakes
I come from a town
Where niggas get down

I come from a place
Liars and snakes (Jealous and hate)
I come from a town
Where niggas get down
I come from a place

[VERSE 1 : BOOSIE BADAZZ]
Where niggas get jacked wit' tha 45
If you ain't strapped, then you gon' die
Ridin' round thinkin' he'll go live
Same MF be sold out
Same MF who'll turn on ya
Get mad, pull out tha burner on ya
Hope you got ya rope on ya
Shit can't trust no nigga on no corner
Love my spot, I'ma throw 4's
Even in tha pen, bitch I throw blows
Mutha fuck you and tha C.O (fuck all ya'll)
My hood bout business lord knows
[?] niggas bitches and hoes
Niggas comment like a bitch
But Boosie stick to tha code
Daddy in tha streets thuggin'
Mama told me go play (Boy get out my face)
Aunties came game on women
Cousins gave me AK's
I got my ways from thugs and killas
In tha midst of tha streets
I know a snake when I see it
You ain't gon' bite me

[HOOK]
I come from a place
Liars and snakes
I come from a town
Where niggas get down

I come from a place
Liars and snakes (Jealous and hate)
I come from a town
Where niggas get down
I come from a place

[VERSE 2: OG Dre)
Everybody real if you ask them
Damn, snakes don't even hiss now
Daddy told me keep my head on a swivel
And remain 10 toes down
Nigga why tha good die young
Hoping that the Lord keep me safe
'Cause I'm young myself
And I'm going out like Tony if they play wit' young Dre uh
Rest in peace Pimp C
What would he do
Ima smack one of these niggas actin' like fools
All these niggas internet thuggin' like it's cool
You a nerd in reality, no tools
Out chea worried bout your followers up on tha 'Gram
When you really need a job just to feed ya fam
Nigga got 2 sons and a daughter
Boy get off yo ass, get a math plan

[HOOK]
I come from a place
Liars and snakes
I come from a town
Where niggas get down

I come from a place
Liars and snakes (Jealous and hate)
I come from a town
Where niggas get down
I come from a place

[VERSE 3: BOOSIE BADAZZ]
If you don't slang iron
Then you don't survive
Most niggas, they make it
But most niggas die
Rest in peace all my niggas (free all my niggas)
Murder rate high in my city
Fucked me up
Know that ain't you testifying nigga
[?] will, used to be
This hood ain't got no unity
Money done turned everybody to snakes
Now it's you or me
You don't work, you don't eat
You don't put in work, you ain't respected
So you gotta have that first
'Fo you tryna rock this necklace
I come from pain
It ain't no bitch in my blood
Boss Man up on my stomach wit a K drippin' in blood
Nigga get down up at tha Chi Town
Nigga hit tha bag when they ride round
Shit you ain't heard
It be drama on my curb
Everybody gettin' served
Niggas know

[HOOK]
I come from a place
Liars and snakes
I come from a town
Where niggas get down

I come from a place
Liars and snakes (Jealous and hate)
I come from a town
Where niggas get down
I come from a place
