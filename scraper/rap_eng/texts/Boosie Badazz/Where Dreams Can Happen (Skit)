And it's always like that
Whereever you're from you'll get hated the most
Most rappers die in their own city. It's a fact
And uhh. You know have haters who were in school with you
And they mad cuz they were in that third grade class with you
But they don't have the same hustle as you
They hate you for no reason. They hate you for your success
If you were a local rapper and didn't have much they would love you
And you develop hatred in your own city
