[Verse 1:]
My life  a movie
Straight action, and non fiction
I’m like a doctor
I fill up all your prescriptnions
This is real
No actor, but I’m still tipping
And my mind on the money
So you know I gotta get it
A grinder came from nothing
Just watching my mamma get it
Devine to become something
Just didn’t know when I get it
So I stayed prayed up
And told mamma Imma go get it
She say her baby boy wild
But one thing he’s about his business
Plus I live my life like fresh
So no snoopers up in my digits
Gotta put that bag up
For a rainy day, bitch you tripping
Fuck trying stuff for them hoe
Cause they wretched like what I’m living
I just want to make the music
And let the world see my vision
That pussy got my dog on the funny style, I won’t kill him
Nah am in this world alone
Just me, myself and Big Puss
Now his spirit living through me ye
Doing this for my nigga
Treat me like royalty
Cause I’m posting up on you nigga
Lil nigga you gotta stack your money
Or save a penny
Never know when you gonna see a rainy day
Boosie told me boss up
Every time you get on the mike you gotta go hard, period
You can’t let up

[Chorus:]
Boosie told me boss up
Jay Day, Jay Day, boss up, Jay Day, boss up
Boosie told me boss up
Jay Day, Jay Day, boss up, Jay Day, boss up, boss up, Lil Jay Day

[Verse 2:]
This ain’t no okie
The poster in front of the corner store
Lil niggas drug hustle but coming up I was wanted most
Ran with the old, but niggas my age my strongest though
My name started ringing
That niggas won’t be my homies, no
Way before this rap shit
It was just me being bold n smoke
Past the trap without a pack
Causing hell everywhere we go
Hooked up with the boss man
He felt my dream and he sell his gold
Not knowing where we going
But he clever, so he already know
His right hand in it
Telling them Lil Jay go blow
Lil nigga, big pistol
His image lived, he got that flow
Lets drop a bag on him
Keep working and see how far it go
The sky's the limit
The Solar System yes I must go
No pressure on my shoulder
But niggas, haters already know
I’m working on them tracks
And let back to back that’s how it go
Jay Day keep that Ak
That nigga smoked you ain’t never know
Bless me with a loyalty
Stamped 10K from my neck to glow
The whole team shining
A movement bigger than belly though
No fuck ups or formers cause niggas we getting heller though
Posted in the projects
Right post that track with that folder on me
Young thug niggas
Only young thugs want me
Boss up
Jay day [x4]

[Chorus]
