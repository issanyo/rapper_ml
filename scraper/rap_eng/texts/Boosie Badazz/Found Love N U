Waiting on daddy to come home
First off I wanna say sorry I was gone so long
Your cards on birthdays made my cry but strong
Every year ma four girls send me valentines love
Rae rae grow this love it grow bigger
MJ came up ma twin lil cold nigga
Every time [?] see me he had to kiss me
[?] couldn’t hold her temper when they diss me
This is real love
Toryanna and lyric b gave the world to me
They even tried to pick the world for me
They sent me love on my birthday
You gotta feel me I be on the cry for hours
When they said not guilty

Never knew love till I found love in you
Never knew love till I found love in you
Never knew love till I found love in you
You’re my little angel angel

[Verse 2]
When I’m feeling down they know it
They come and hug me
When I’m feeling down they show it
They say they love me
Facetime me in the morning I pray with them at night
Saturday night we watch movies
Clowning acting stupid
And boy I miss them when I’m on that road
So most time they with me when I’m on that road
Cancer up in ma kidney
All my kids stay close
They love me to death
Mommas can tell em what they want
That’s why I keep it real with my daughters
I let em know, no man is go love you like your father
I tell my sons
Fuck a friend you ain’t need em
They say I know daddy
Cause you my best friend
I’m fucking right son

[Hook]
Never knew love till I found love in you
Never knew love till I found love in you
Never knew love till I found love in you
You’re my little angel angel
Never knew love till I found love in you
Never knew love till I found love in you
Never knew love till I found love in you
You’re my little gangster gangster

[Outro]
I send this to ma kids at home
Waiting on daddy to come home
I’ll be home in a minute
I send this to ma kids at home
Waiting on daddy to come home
I’ll be home in a minute
I do it for you , yeah

So your childhood won’t be like my childhood
That is love
That is love
That is love
That is love
