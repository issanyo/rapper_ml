[VERSE 1 : PLIES]
Just might hit ol Scooter and tell 'em
Meet me in Lil' Mexico
Just might hit [?] and tell 'em bring them 30's thru
Just might grab me 20 bricks
And take 'em all and break 'em down
Just might pay my bitch to use her spot so I can trap it out
60 grand on me, no security, I'm all in Lenox wit' it
Show you all these cars in my garage
You'll think that I would get it
Hit me once so bad [?] she work at Majic City
Please don't reach for nothing around my neck
You know I keep it wit' me

[VERSE 3: PLIES]
I be higher than a bitch
It got me feelin' like Al Capone
I just walked inside of Saks
And spunt a stack on my cologne
Said she don't feel like fuckin'
I told her well let me get tha dome
Asked me why my eyes so red
Cause I been smokin' on tha strong
Please don't throw me off
I'm countin' this money, it got me in a zone
In this kitchen doin' magic
Tryna whip me up a [?]
Asked me why I'm always drankin'
I told her cause bitch I'm fuckin' grown
You ain't really wit' da shits lil homie
Then please don't hit my phone
