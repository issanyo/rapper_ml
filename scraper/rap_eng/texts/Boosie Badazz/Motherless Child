[Intro]
He think he grown and he know it
He think he grown and he show it
Fatherless child, motherless child
He think he grown and he know it
He think he grown and he show it
You separate bars from man to man from bars

[Verse 1]
Damn, Mikey
Why you never talk to no one in school?
Why you be actin' so rude?
You ain't got no friends at all with you
You walk home but I never see nobody walk with you
Or talk to you
Girls try to talk to you, it's like you cold inside
You keep on walkin' on a bitch
Kinda cold inside
You don't even trust your friends
'cause you never had a friend
'cause your mother left you when you was 10
Life full of sin
Walk to the store with the fiends
Conversate with the bums
Got no goals in your life
You ok with the slums
He been broke since he was young
He can't envision no peace
His daddy smokin' the pipe
His mama stuck in the streets
Fatherless child

[Chorus]
He think he grown and he know it
He think he grown and he show it
He need a meal to feed his motherfuckin' self, homie
I know, fatherless child
I know, motherless child
I know, fatherless child
I know, motherless child

[Verse 2]
Wake up cookin' fuckin' breakfast
Iron his own clothes
Cook his own fuckin' dope
He don't trust hoes
He too scared to be a daddy
He don't trust hoes
What you expect, his mama left
He don't trust hoes
My daddy left when I was 14, I was fatherless
Nearly 14 up in the deep, real retarded shit
I sleep and eat on Garfield, I was fatherless
Connie can't tell me nothin' I don't wanna hear Taqueria shit
My nigga Titus lost his mama
Been sellin' dope since he was 9
He say his Aunty his mommy and mad at his daddy
Can't nobody make him go to school
So he don't go, he ratchet
He say fuck the world
He get money he have to
Motherless child

[Chorus]
He think he grown and he know it
He think he grown and he show it
He need a meal to feed his motherfuckin' self, homie
I know, fatherless child
I know, motherless child
I know, fatherless child
I know, motherless child

[Verse 3]
Free all my niggas in prison
Who need to be back with they children and siblings
So they can have less fatherless children runnin' this Earth
My niggas come from the dirt
The mud is downgrade
He got no mama and no daddy
So fuck it he found Satan
Fatherless child
Lookin' for love he lost patience
Got a pistol and went crazy
Wishin' he was Wayne shit so he could call Baby
This a fatherless child in a fatherless situation
He never had a father and I want a rapper to replace him

[Chorus]
He think he grown and he know it
He think he grown and he show it
He need a meal, he feed his motherfuckin' self, homie
I know, fatherless child
I know, motherless child
I know, fatherless child
I know, motherless child

[Outro]
I know your pain
Fatherless child
[?]
Motherless child
The walk that he walk
Fatherless child
You might of lost your mom and your daddy
Pray for that child
This for that lil girl sellin' pussy
Fatherless child
For that lil nigga in juvenile detention center
Pray for that child
Pray for that child
Fatherless child
