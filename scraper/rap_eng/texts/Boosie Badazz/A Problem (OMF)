[Hook]
‘95 Max on, Dope boy cologne on
Creed, and I ain’t talking bout the movie
(This ain’t no movie)
Bad bitches on my black phone
Murder on the trap phone
30 chains on me like i'm gucci
Bitch you got a problem
Can’t nobody solve it
Bitch you got a problem
Ain't nobody solving it
Bitch you got a problem
Ain't nobody solving it
Mix with goons and gobblings
I've been fucking with a problem

[Verse 1]
Ima well known nigga in the state of Louisiana
Got more respect than any rapper
I'm [?] in Alabama
I got guns but not for cameras
The new man up in Atlanta
I'm the strap on your lap
I'm the act in the Phantom
I'm too hot to hot to handle
The police hate my guts
Cuz the niggas kicking dust
They was raised by us
What the fuck
The front page of the paper
The backside in the middle
On parole, but still can’t get me not to ride with my pistol
Boosie

[Verse 2]
I got tats on my body
I got blood on my hands boy
Soldiers in my posse
Bout it, Bout it we ain’t playing boy

Couldn't control his hoes
He exposed, you ain't no pimp boy
Bitch you know the code
I'm Boosie boo I'm a hot boy
No I can't be faithful hoe
That's why I want a hot girl
Never back down go to war
Anytime a day
Waffle house at 6 bitch

They say he be on different drugs
Bitch I'm sober wit it

You know you ain't built like me nigga
You wasn’t raised where I was raised, nigga believe that
