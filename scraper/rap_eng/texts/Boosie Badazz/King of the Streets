[Intro]
Badazz, Boosie Badazz, Badazz

[Hook]
The streets need me (me, me, me), but all the real nigguhs like me, they gon' get lost with these other bullshit ass motherfuckers, for real
The streets need me  (me, me, me)
I got y'all, I got the nigguhs in the pen, I got the nigguhs on the streets, I'll never let us down

When everybody left the streets, mayne I never left the streets
When they stopped rappin' bout the streets I kept it street
And the streets need me
The king of the street shit, I know it
The king of the street shit, I know it
The king of the street shit, I know it
I think I'm the king of the streets

[Verse]
This for my dogs in the pen, who can't get a call in the pen
This ex's nigga, he a bitch, don't wanna let him talk to his kids
This is all that I know, this is all that I know
This is all that I know, it's the streets, nigguh
Get bodies and pistols and duckin' them hitters
I hold my court in the streets
In the streets they buy my music, (when you ride)
You gon' hear a lot of Boosie, (they go loud)
Lot of women, lot of groupies, (slip and slide)
Slidin' in 'em like Jacuzzi
If you where I'm from, If you where I'm from
Then you understand, you understand
Gotta get out this hellhole, we got a plan
Get out the ghetto and feed our little man
Go get the millions and get us some land
No snitchin', fuck snitchin', No snitchin', fuck snitchin'
This is the (streets), Project nigguhs need me
(streets), West love me like Eazy
They know I'm the king of the streets, (beast)

[Hook]
The streets need me, but all the real nigguhs like me, they gon' get lost with these other bullshit ass motherfuckers, for real
The streets need me  (me, me, me)
I got y'all, I got the nigguhs in the pen, I got the nigguhs in the streets, I'll never let us down, believe that


When everybody left the streets, mayne I never left the streets
When they stopped rappin' bout the streets I kept it street, nigguh
And the streets need me
The king of the street shit, I know it
The king of the street shit, I know it
The king of the street shit, I know it
I think I'm the king of the streets

[Verse 2]
This talkin' that G shit, (Boosie)
This talkin' that street shit, (Badazz)
Street shit mixed with G shit
Gold jewelry then half a key shit
I'm a real nigguh, show you how to get a  bag, (no bodybag)
Motivation, if you look at me you gon' be like, damn, I gotta get a bag
Everybody goin' commercial, probably why I can't get a commercial
But fuck 'em, I got the streets in my palm
Dead homies on my arm, (Rest in peace, nigguh)
Louisiana in the swamp, dirty laundry in the trunk
Droppin' every other month, in the section cuttin' up
I spit the real and I
Be touchin' my people inside
I make them vibe, you ain't gotta be high
My music go loud, somebody gon' die
Rock-a-bye
This the life in the streets
Fuck tuckin' in your pillow, tuck your rifle to sleep

[Hook]
The streets need me (me, me, me), but all the real nigguhs like me, they gon' get lost with these other bullshit ass motherfuckers, for real
The streets need me  (me, me, me)
I got y'all, I got the nigguhs in the pen, I got the nigguhs in the streets, I'll never let us down, believe that

When everybody left the streets, mayne I never left the streets
When they stopped rappin' bout the streets I kept it street
And the streets need me
The king of the street shit, I know it
The king of the street shit, I know it
The king of the street shit, I know it
I think I'm the king of the streets

[Outro]
Cold water in the pot, uncle told me get it hot
Mayne, that hard, now that's the rhyme, nigguh
