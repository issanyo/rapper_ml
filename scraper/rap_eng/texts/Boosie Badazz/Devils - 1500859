[Verse 1:]
Mane it's Payback
For All Da Months Dat I Layed Back
For All Da Blunts Dat Had Me Lazy And Crazy
It's Drama Time {Time}
I'm Gettin' Ten For A Show {Let's Go}
Album Ain't Even Dropped
When it's Dropped I'm Gettin' Mo
Wish I Can Go Down Every Street {Every Street}
But Da Fuckin' Narcotics Say I Got Death On Me
Niggas They Try To Rebel Me {Shiid}
But it's Motivation
I'm a Keep Gettin' Money
Gon' Soulja Hate Me
Da Judge Looked At Me
And Said How You Doin' Boosie
He Called Me By My Nickname {Ooooh}

And Lose Me In The System
But Like C-Murder And Mack
I Refuse To Be A Victim Nigga

[Chorus:]
Devils Get Up Off Me [x8]

I'm So Gutta, So Gangsta, So In Da Streets {What Else?}
