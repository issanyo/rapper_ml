Of a 2 way love affiar
Imm trapped;caught up
Caught up
In the middle

Of a 2 way love affair
-verse 1-
I know i fucked up
I hurt you so many times
I know u tierd of cryin
(but,but,but,but)
I apologize
Can you come n take a ride in my 45
Real talk im missing you
Kissing you and hugging you tight
And makin love on sight
(we fuck wherever)
We together is the best i ever done
But when the love gets to deep
I run
But i love you though
Cuz you on my mind everytime i fuck another hoe
Thats how i really know
Late night countin paper with me
(i remember)
Bubble bath,u use to cater to me
Dont wanna lose you to the streets
Thats why everytime we beef
I call ya like "lets meet"
(fa real)
Shit dun got too deep
You dont want to be my friend
I gotta old lady n she been here
-bridge-
Whats up man(whats up)

-chorus-
Trapped
Im caught up; caught up
In the middle
(yea)the middle
Of a 2 way love affair
(repeat)
-verse 2-
Say girl you know whats happenin
You know what i do
The way she say she love boo
She can't be number 2
So we beefin; she cheatin
And i dun lost love
Plus my real thang
Man i almost lost her
Wan be wit you somtimes
Wanna be wit her somtimes
If i could have you both
That'll really blow my mind
Sometimes i want to let you both go
But they get me in the bed
N they take me on that rodeo
Why u can't let her go?
Cuz i love her
And she been down wit me from the shine
To the struggle
(u dont understand)
You a bad muhfucka
You say you love me
What got me feenin for you;

-chorus-
Trapped
Im caught up; caught up
In the middle(yea)
The middle
Of a 2 way love affair
(repeat)
