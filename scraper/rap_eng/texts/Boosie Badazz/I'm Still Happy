[HOOK ]
Used to hold my head down not no more
Diabetes in my body Police kicking at my door
But I'm still happy, But I'm still happy
But I'm still happy, Boosie boo still happy
Baby mama drama steady fighting with these hoes
Might be going up the road
But guess what I'm still happy
I'm still happy, I'm still happy
I'm still happy, Boosie boo still happy
Used to hold my head down not no more
Diabetes in my body Police kicking at my door
But I'm still happy, But I'm still happy
But I'm still happy, Boosie boo still happy

[VERSE 1]
Through all the pain and the stuggle yeah I still smile
House arrest on my leg but I still smile
Still cheesing even I'm gon be gone awhile
Still gon get visits from my youngest to my oldest child
Walk in my house look in my closet you can see this shit
I come from nothin sometimes I can believe this shit
Several whips rimmed up that'll make me smile
Comin up as a child I walked some long miles
Heard these playa haters eye keep em on mine
Rappers slack entrupenur my money grown now
Police kickin down my door bitches want they child support
Can't even smoke no more so I turn to the mojo
And I think I can fuck any girl in the world
Cuz boosie boo the shit like the 80's Jheri Curl
DEA lookin at a nigga like why you smiling at me
Cuz Hillary Moore your ass racist and its easy to see

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2]
Album just hit the store smiling my ass off
Got your baby mama and I'm knockin her ass up
A year in jail, oh well man I'm laughin at that
Could of been 10 or 20 so I'm happy with that
Made 6 beautiful kids god bless em with cake
My motivatation when I see em is the smile on their face
To be lil boosie badass and I wouldn't trade it for shit
You know how many bad bitchesdon ate this dick
My daughters bringing straight A's shoutout to Ivy and Tyt
But tootie he cuttin up that lil nigga fucked up
Plus I'm a boss I buy what I wanna s
Stacks on deck In the hood I got respect
Riding through the southside everybody screaming
Pocket full of money the whole click leanin
Used to hustle front the store not no mo
Started at 500 how its 30 grand a show
(So I'm happy)

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
Used to be worried bout shit that I had heard about (boosie a pussy)
Now I laugh at they ass my throw some cash at they ass
So many people know I'm holding it down
Laughing at my old teachers like look at me now
Riding through the south side throwing it up
Hood love the shit out me cuz I keep blowing it up
Diabetes in my body still thanking the lord
Used to make a nigga mad but now it make me go hard
Six cars in the yard no notes im no jokes
Prolly why a nigga smiling when he goin to court
And I never tried coke I'm proud of myself
I'm jigga man down south compared to no one there
Been shot at a couple times I ain't ready for death
The man up above thats my bulletproof vest
TVs pop out the dresser flat screens in every room
Hit the diving board of my 13ft pool

[HOOK]
