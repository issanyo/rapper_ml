[Intro: MobSquad Nard & Boosie Badazz]
Ladies and gentlemen
It’s Badazz
Nardo Da'Vinci
Itz Dat

[Verse 1: MobSquad Nard]
We got sevens for the 90 shit come straight from California
We ain't got no quarter Ps for them lil niggas round da corner
I’m coming through the bottom buckled up that bitch on fire
Tuck that 40 by me tighter while I'm trying to strike my lighter
Turnt up Spicer wit my rifle need that sack to fix my biter
Rest in peace to Trouble still I'm thuggin’ in this cycle went from baby ganstas smacking shit
To mobbing on some stacking shit
I’m running circles
Clock them racks a bit, u slow as activist
Waaan one time for niggas selling dimes but not them ounces and them bitches who finesse the public housing for them vouchers
When we turn up in this bitch you ain't gone douse it bitch I'm clowning
Count them benjis on them couches
Want the trillest you done found it yeah itz dat
We pull up back to back Rovers bet you can't down us
Fresh ass, when I'm in polo the finest fuck that designer boy this chopper made in China
I’m Made in Harborview but you'll swear im from Magnolia I’m big timing in my diamonds was hannin’

[Chorus]
What’s hannin’ x 15
Itz Dat x 17

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
I got choppers and they ready, I got bullets in the yard
Residue under our nails, I got pushers in the yard
That's a grown fucking man and I'm pushing off the yard
Bankroll in my pants, but I'd rather swipe the card
Itz dat, Itz dat, I've been gettin' it by the load
I've been looking in the mirror and it look like a nigga froze
I be shining for a reason, I'm the one God chose
I've been having my assumptions, it look like these niggas hoes
Hoes lick my soul, my eyes closed
I got flows, all real my lord knows
I got hoes, different cities with different pussies
I smoke loud, OG and plenty cookies
I'm gon' ball, sell coke, rap or rob
I can do it all, I'm like Kobe with the ball
Got my name on the wall where the real niggas at
Came home, shoot back, bitch nigga, take that

[Chorus]
What’s hannin’ x 15
Itz Dat x 17
