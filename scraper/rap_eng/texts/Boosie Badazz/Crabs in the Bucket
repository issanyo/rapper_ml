[Intro]
I want to thank god for getting me out the bucket...
The grind life...
Yall crabs in a bucket
The grind life
This ain’t swimming pool nigga
We thugging

[Verse 1]
Marcus momma smoke crack and his daddy was a pusher
His cousin on for busting mother fuckers like a russian
Cory momma crazy, him and Tony got nothing
As long as Cory got food, him and Tony got something
His uncle name Wayne, he smoking crack with my uncle
Hit heavy in the cane, selling crack to my uncle
Suge momma died man he was only 5
His cousin robbed a trailer, gave that boy only 45
They gave that boy 45

[Hook]
We was crabs in the bucket and if we make it out we lucky but we thugging
The grind life
If we make it out we lucky but we crabs in the bucket and fuck it
Grind life

[Verse 2]
Head buster was my thug nigga
Daddy was a smoker
Put it on ya quick, nigga crazy like the joker
My nigga fired things whole family straight thugging
His big brother my big brother
He best friends with my cousin
All of us was crabs in the bucket
Directions from the OG’s
Like Ya lil nigga bust it
Kevin was a thug, his momma could tell him nothing
6 at the top and the bottom he was thugging
No time to play the cops and the robbers we was hustling
Big boy done lost his momma and big Chris like my cousin
We all came from nothing, we clutchin and we bustin
Another cross breed
Go to your head and try for Brohnson
That’s the blood of a gangsta

[Hook]
We was crabs in the bucket and if we make it out we lucky but we thugging
The grind life
If we make it out we lucky but we crabs in the bucket and fuck it
Grind life

[Verse 3]
Fresh was a hard head since he was young
Paula use to try to tell us change cuz we was young
But still we was some hard heads
On the hill coming
They stood over my boy (mike boy) with a pump
My momma was a teacher and my daddy was a sniffer
His brother up in hunts
And his son on that river
I was on that river like the crabs in the bucket
Nothing but killers around me on the yard with them pokers
Far from broke niggas we was young dope dealers
All my childhood friends got somebody up the road
We put it in our hand, guarantee to smoke niggas
All my childhood friends, all of us sell snow
All of us sell dope

[Hook]
We was crabs in the bucket and if we make it out we lucky but we thugging
Thug life
If we make it out we lucky but we crabs in the bucket and fuck it
If we make it out that bucket
We was crabs in the bucket and if we make it out we lucky but we thugging
I hop you make it out the bucket
If we make it out we lucky but we crabs in the bucket and fuck it
I hope you make it out that bucket
