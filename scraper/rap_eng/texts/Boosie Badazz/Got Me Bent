[Webbie:]
Ain't this about a bitch this nigga actin all tough
Like he somebody special and can't get his ass bust

Do you something decent all the gangstas stand up

Say ya hustling bout that bustin real hustling yeah I hear ya
Betta get from round here looking unfamiliar for I kill ya
Whole click tatted bad and that's just how a nigga livin
Mix the liquor wit the killer now they jumpin to the ceiling
Kinda make you fill like fightin and I'm likin how it's feelin
Crowds jumpin crowd sumthin get to jumpin on a nigga
Strapped up wit lickin took it straight up in the kitchen

Hit you wit that iron you gon wish yo momma had an abortion
Get retarted in this club you really gon need escortin
To yo muthafuckin car my niggas waitin outside
Hollerin mutha fuck the law
If you gon take us then take us
Shut yo muthafuckin jaw
Bout 30 hoes outside but they ain't sayin what they saw
Cuz they know how we is
Some ole baton rouge niggas and they know how we live
We know where they live and well come fuck wit they kids
I hear they hollerin I be stuntin I don't live what I'm talking
I ain't really push the rover I really be walkin
I got news for you bitch I don't lease I don't rent
I hit the lot in gerry lane couldn't believe what I spent
You see that truck in front yo house that's that hit I just sent
And for you local muthafuckas bitch you got me bent

[Chorus:]
