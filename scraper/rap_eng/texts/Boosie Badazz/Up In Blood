[Chorus]
Death before dishonor put my trust up in these slugs
No trust, no love
Say bitch I get it up in blood
Tell me when did I go wrong, where did I go wrong?
We just wanted to get on
Bitch I get it up in blood
I got so many niggas gone, so many comin' home
For my team I put on
Bitch I get it up in blood nigga
Say bitch I get it up in blood
I get it up in blood

[NBA Youngboy Verse 1]
These niggas be hatin' tryna fuck my name up
I been gettin' it in tryna get my bread up
Can't trust nobody, can't let'em get me caught up
Get up in my way he gone get his head busted
Bop yo head to my music but don't feel my pain
Shit too deep you'll never understand
Same ole shit seem like it don't change
Some pussy ass niggas get hit with that flame
No i can't step I'm still learning the game
Ride through my city and I'm strapped with that thang
I gotta stay focus I'm only 16, perfect my crowd pursuing my dreams
In the life of a Menace I go by the name youngboy
Call the shots cause I'm over that gang
She looked in my face and was tellin' them lies
Got deno to set that hoe car up in flames
Just cause he my cousin I ain't let him slide
Shoot his mama house up since he think that I'm playin'
My and P steal a truck fill that bitch up with gas shoot out of time and come up on that bag
We gone take everything since he want a taste


[Chorus]
Death before dishonor put my trust up in these slugs
No trust, no love
Say bitch I get it up in blood
Tell me when did I go wrong, where did I go wrong?
We just wanted to get on
Bitch I get it up in blood
I got so many niggas gone, so many comin' home
For my team I put on
Bitch I get it up in blood nigga
Say bitch I get it up in blood
I get it up in blood

[Boosie Badazz Verse]
Murder, terrorizing, that's all they understand
Enemies, memories I got some bloody hands
Son of a hitter, cold nigga with some cold ways
My court days, rest in peace to all my throwaways
I sit and smile like fuck them niggas on my Jolcing days
Straight disrespect, what you expect they suppose to lay
I know these niggas don't love me so why should I trust them?
These niggas they bustas, I put em' in ditches I put em' on crutches, slanging them cutters
I done lost too many niggas, took too many losses
He wasn't bout busting his trigger, took the boss of bosses
Got caught by the vultures, if you slippin' it may cost ya'
Jeepers creepers in these waters, best leave home with your revolver
I hope yo people got extensions cause them boys got shooters
It's bout who catch the other slippin it's not bout choppers and rugers
I pray I come home to Connie
It's me, Youngboy and that llama
Been a young boy bout that drama
Thuggin death fo' dishonor
BOSS MAYNE


[Chorus]
Death before dishonor put my trust up in these slugs
No trust, no love
Say bitch I get it up in blood
Tell me when did I go wrong, where did I go wrong?
We just wanted to get on
Bitch I get it up in blood
I got so many niggas gone, so many comin' home
For my team I put on
Bitch I get it up in blood nigga
Say bitch I get it up in blood
I get it up in blood
