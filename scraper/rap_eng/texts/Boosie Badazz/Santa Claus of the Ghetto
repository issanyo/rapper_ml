[Intro]
Playboy on the beat
Santa to me
Santa Claus ain't never really come down our chimney
We had other Santa Claus
Straight up
They was Santa to me

[Verse 1]
I know a nigga out my hood, he brought everybody turkey
Hustlin', hustler, he had everybody workin'
Clean from head to toe when you see him up in person (Sha)
He'll break you off a pack if you hungry and you thirsty (Cha)
I'm talkin' Cam Ricks, Lee Lucas, Kenny Wayne (Yeah)
Only thing we got from Michael Jordan was a ring
A fifty dollar bill will make a kid smile bright
Thank you, Mr. Dope Dealer, for what you did that night
Hit a nigga with a whole brick just for lead, get on your feet
This some full shit, no ho shit, this shit is deep
He had to whack a nigga (Whack 'em), smack a nigga (Smack 'em)
That nigga weak, holidays he flood the whole street
Santa Claus of the ghetto

[Chorus]
Santa Clause of the ghetto
Please, don't go to jail, my nigga (My nigga)
Santa Claus of the ghetto

[Verse 2]
He bought his mama a house, told her, "Merry Christmas" (Hi, mom)
This nigga livin' like a boss, he bought his sister a Rolly (Woo)
And a bracelet to match (Damn), told her, "Merry Christmas" (Merry Christmas)
Now these niggas showin' up
He put Gucci on his daughter, he put Gucci on her mama
Merry Christmas, girl, 'cause you loyal and you silent
Now, we talkin' diamonds, little chains for the clique (Yeah)
That's all them niggas need, they ain't never had shit
Same nigga, same fit, same game, same clique
Merry Christmas, nigga, dog, you home from the pen
When I was a kid, I prayed that God protect Santa
Keep him gettin' money, keep that nigga out the slammer
Santa Claus of the ghetto

[Chorus]
Santa Clause of the ghetto
Please, don't go to jail, my nigga (My nigga)
Don't go to jail, not right now
Santa Claus of the ghetto

[Refrain]
I know you gotta do what you do, but
Nigga stay out here, a nigga need you
Please, don't go to jail, my nigga (My nigga)
Don't go to jail, don't go to jail
Check it, this for the outro

[Outro]
Santa I know pay bills for the old folks
Santa I know give gifts to they kinfolk
Santa I know will bail you out you go to jail, nigga
Santa I know will cut your motherfuckin' throat
Feed it to the reindeer and ride with 'em everywhere
Santa I know will put a nigga on
This for Big U and the Crips
I know they got some Crips ridin'
Don't go to jail, my nigga
Santa Claus of the ghetto
Stay outta jail, nigga
The hood needs you
