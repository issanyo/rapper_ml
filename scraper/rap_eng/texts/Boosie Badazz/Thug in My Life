[Talking]
Attention ladies I'm tired of playin
Why the fuck you tryin fuck when you know you gotta man
Wonder if my girl like that thank about it
That's what got me packin and I'm out it
Lets go

[Verse one]
She keep on askin me bout hoes everyday
But I'm comin home to you so fuck what these hoes say
But its time to go
So now I'm searchin at the club
So I can find somebody just like me a straight thug
With a heart of a winner who fix me breakfast for dinner
Who won't fuss when I get home just let go up in her
That's what I'm lookin for
A girl who far from a rookie bra
But she gotta be raw so all my haters could look at her
So thru the door came this click of lil cuties
And I was hopin one of them would like to get with lil boosie
So I picked the rawest one out the click
Grabbed her by her shoulder uh and told her this

[Chorus: repeat]
I need a thug in my life
And you ain't gotta be my wife
Just hold me down when its tight
And we gone ride on first class
And you ain't gotta be afraid
Anything you want you ask

[Verse two]
Now on the first day she told me
That we could only be friends
Say she was hurt once before by this lil nigga with ends
Ran into me bout her problems as she lay on the pillow
Told me how her momma died and how her pops was a killer
Told me how she lost her virgin to this nigga who lied
Broke her heart told her he loved her just to get up inside
That's when we went on a ride to New Orleans
I made her smile the whole time
I laced a bottle with wine and told her this is how it should be
And asked her can have her heart she said could be
I told her bout my lifetime that's when she started to cry
Told me she coulnd't believe that I was walkin the life
I told all I want from her is her heart
Don't worry bout the sex we can do that when you want start
She ain't want to go home so I let her stay with me
And whispered in her ear right before she lay to sleep

[Chorus: repeat]

[Verse three]
As time went on we got on (we got on)
Now three months later we majoring back and forth to Las Vegas
Smokin on Garcia Vega and my hoes mad
I told them get they shit together now they see all leather
On my wrist is the  better see my bitch bout whatever
And she was taught by ?Torrance? so she was taught by the devil
Wasn't no thug when I met her but I seen it up in her
But she love my thug pleasures so I got me a winner
Breakfast or dinner she happy for a thug on time
And when we fuckin she be screamin like I'm touchin her spine
I know I'm touchin her mind cause she ain't never had a thug
Who fucked in a suit over the city in a tub
And money don't change her
She stay the same thru thick and thin
Kept her pussy in her draws when I went off to the pen
That's why I depend she more than a friend
She the one who took the charge when the do' got kicked in
Ya heard me
