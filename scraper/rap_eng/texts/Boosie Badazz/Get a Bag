[Intro: Boosie Badazz]
Cookie money
Get your bag, nigga, get your bag
(Get your motherfuckin' bag, nigga)
Get your bag, lil' nigga (Straight up)
Boy, you hella tall
You tryna get rich 'round here, get off your ass
They ain't give a nigga shit 'round here (They ain't give a nigga shit 'round here)
You tryna get rich 'round here, get off your ass
'Cause they ain't give a nigga shit 'round here (Get money)
Cookie

[Verse 1: Cookie Money]
Cookie floodin' this bitch, I got that drip on me
I be stuntin' on these niggas, I got that stick on me
Big .40 shells'll knock down your big homie
He got that fake cash, you know I got that real money
Wrap a brick, hit the road, pay her bail money
I'm with some Peach Street niggas that's gon' kill for me
I keep a bad lil' bitch that's gon' strip for me
Eighty racks on my wrist, this ain't a cheap Rollie
Man, we ballin' on these niggas, bitch, I think I'm Curry
A rookie with a ring, flexin' like I'm Quinn Cook
On the block I'm the king, bitch, it's Lil Cook
Gold Forgis on this Benz make the hoes look, ayy

[Chorus: Cookie Money]
I'm gettin' cash, lil' bitch, you know I get it fast
Get off your ass, lil' nigga, better get a bag
I got some cookie out of state, bricks in the stash
I ain't goin' back broke, I gotta make it last
I'm gettin' cash, lil' bitch, you know I get it fast
Get off your ass, lil' nigga, better get a bag
I got some cookie out of state, bricks in the stash
I ain't goin' back broke, I gotta make it last

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
I'm a Down South nigga but I be in East Oakland (Yeah yeah)
Chillin' with the freaks in East Oakland (Yeah yeah)
Smokin' out the P when I'm in the town (Cookie)
Makin' real money when I fuck around
Got a bag and a whole lot of diamonds (Bling bling)
Show my ass, do a whole lot of shining (Bling bling)
I ain't goin' back broke, I'm a go-getter (I'm a go-getter)
If she a go-getter, I'll take your ho, nigga
I'm gettin' money, niggas hate me now
Quick money, rich money, Las Vegas style (Woo)
So if you tryna get rich 'round here
Get off your ass, 'cause they ain't givin' niggas shit 'round here
Boosie

[Chorus: Cookie Money]
I'm gettin' cash, lil' bitch, you know I get it fast
Get off your ass, lil' nigga, better get a bag
I got some cookie out of state, bricks in the stash
I ain't goin' back broke, I gotta make it last
I'm gettin' cash, lil' bitch, you know I get it fast
Get off your ass, lil' nigga, better get a bag
I got some cookie out of state, bricks in the stash
I ain't goin' back broke, I gotta make it last

[Verse 3: Philthy Rich]
Ayy, it's Philthy, nigga, uh-huh, look
We locked in, niggas know who I fuck with
But I can't fuck with you, you don't fuck with niggas I fuck with (Uh-uh)
I don't pick sides, and nigga, I don't dick ride (I don't dick ride)
Play with me, your family pay for the funeral with a fish fry (It's Philthy, nigga)
I fuck with the big dawgs from your neighborhood (Solid)
Niggas keep gettin' picked off until I say it's good (Do that)
I got a bitch from Baton Rouge, cocky and rude (Bitch)
I fucked her on the balcony, she topped me in the pool (It's Philthy, ho)
Cook in that Ghost, you know I'm in that Wraith (Is that right?)
I went and threw that SemGod on the plates (Swear to God)
S-63 and the four by four (Foreign)
Tryna keep up with me, you gon' end up broke, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Cookie Money]
I'm gettin' cash, lil' bitch, you know I get it fast
Get off your ass, lil' nigga, better get a bag
I got some cookie out of state, bricks in the stash
I ain't goin' back broke, I gotta make it last
I'm gettin' cash, lil' bitch, you know I get it fast
Get off your ass, lil' nigga, better get a bag
I got some cookie out of state, bricks in the stash
I ain't goin' back broke, I gotta make it last
