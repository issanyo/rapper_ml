[Hook]
We got cops killing kids
They don’t miss when they attacked, only crime he was black
This is World War 6
We got ISIS around this bitch
Killing hundreds after hundreds with one hit
This is World War 6

[Verse 1]
Maan
You ain’t seen the news? Laquan McDonald, Chicago PD
Shot him down in cold blood, guess what? It’s right on TV
Sandra Bland, man, what the fuck is going on?
Got her picture but not her body, you motherfuckers wrong
Kill all the kindergarten kids, that’s the devil, man
They say Bill Cosby raping people, not the Jello man
Thugs killing thugs, Bloods killing Bloods
They ask lil' daddy why he did it, he said “just because”
World War 6 for real

[Hook]
We got cops killing kids
They don’t miss when they attacked
Only crime he was black
This is World War 6
We got ISIS around this bitch
Killing hundreds after hundreds with one hit
This is World War 6


[Verse 2]
If Trump wins, he’s saying he’s building the wall to stop the dope
Now we at war with Chapo, not just him, a lot more
ATL, 80 degress on Christmas, oh my god, man
How the hell hurricanes hit New Jersey and New York, man?
ISIS just left Paris then went to California
They’re scared, they’re closing schools, I need some marijuana
The police set you up and get a freebee
First 48, they want you dead, they make you rat on TV, it’s war
Sent us to prison for life for a lil’ small substance
While you bitches snort cocaine with your golf buddies
We could be murdered seven ways, never knowing shit
AIDS wasn’t enough, now they invented this Ebola shit
It’s war, man

[Hook]
We got cops killing kids
They don’t miss when they attacked
Only crime he was black
This is World War 6
We got ISIS around this bitch
Killing hundreds after hundreds with one hit
This is World War 6
