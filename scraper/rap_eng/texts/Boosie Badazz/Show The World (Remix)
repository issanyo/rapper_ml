We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my brother
You gotta feel it, lil hustler
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my nigga
You gotta feel it, lil nigga

Look, I came home to show the world
Same Boosie, same music that exposed the world
Of all his wrongs, the real and what's goin on
I touch a million peoples heart wit every song
Its my grind, my time no exceptions homie
Nobody coming,like I'm coming
Theres no pressure on me
Five years me against the world, Pac feeling
Why you buy all that jewelry? I'm a project nigga
Came home to lay the real off
Hoping kids learn from my mistakes and take a different route
I represent for the real. its always real talk
So if you hating on boosie thats your fault
Real quality street music defines me
Murder, raps, drugs, daps remind me
That i gotta show the world that they can't stop me
Came home swinging like rocky, its knock out time!

We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my brother
You gotta feel it, lil hustler
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my nigga
You gotta feel it, lil nigga

All i ask is you listen and learn
Nothing was given in the world, i earned
Everything, so i deserve everything
Ask my fans bout me they gone tell you boosie special mane
Cause i speak when people need to hear
And this year i promise you gone be seeing it clear that I'm the man
The hood helping hand, don't trip
The hood miss me like tiny love tip
And this time I'm going hard, gotta get it man
Got my own clothing line now, business man
Diabetes steady working on my kidneys man
But that just makes me go harder and live smarter
Bad ass TNT, the new world order
God keep blessing me cause I'm a good father
Got my own haircut boosie fade, hip hop for now on
We gonna call this the Boosie days

We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my brother
You gotta feel it, lil hustler
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my nigga
You gotta feel it, lil nigga

K. michelle
I remember when i lost all hope
So much drama, can't take no more
My heart won't beat i can barely breath
Momma on her knees please praying for me
No food to eat, no place to sleep
I just wanna say No body would believe
All up on the radio telling my story
From the hundred to the million, i ain't got no worries

We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my brother
You gotta feel it, lil hustler
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my nigga
You gotta feel it, lil nigga
