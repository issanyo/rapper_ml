Another one
Gets no better than that

Got a nigga like
Damn, I thought this nigga was stand up
Til he met this bad ass bitch, fucked lil' man up
Used to be a playa, had 'em all complexions
Now that pussy got him wanna beef wit' all his girl ex's
Hustlin' done slowed up
Swag startin' to leave nigga
A ho gon' be a ho, and a saint when she need a nigga
Hate to see you lookin' down, nigga get ya shit straight
You went against your own family for her
You took tha bitch fate, she street huh
She two steps ahead, you beat na
You buy for her, before you buy you
Nigga you weak na
You caught a charge slangin' hard, runnin' wit' tha pack
You listen to ya bitch who told ya rat
Damn

[Chorus]
Another one (repeated)
Pussy got 'em gone sour
Another one (repeated)
We losin' real niggas by tha hour
Cuz pussy got him gone sour
Another one (repeated)

[VERSE 2]
I seen pussy make plenty niggas pillow talk
Pussy nigga cut all his niggas completely off
Niggas you think built strong, if you only knew
Nigga fuck his bitch, now he wanna shoot
Don't be crazy, it's plenty of fine pussy
Too many niggas in prison behind pussy nigga
I see another one, got money and he cuffin' ha
Mad at a block nigga who got crumbs, and he fuckin'
Ghetto Boys been told ya how niggas die over cat
Pussy make headbussas transform into rats
I'm sick and tired, sick and tired, sick and tired of you pussy niggas
Say she bout to leave, now he wanna kill her
Then he kill hisself, now that's a duck nigga
He should of leave her, let her go and fuck that nigga
Now you gone, family all fucked up
Lookin', and it's all behind that pussy


[Chorus]
Another one (repeated)
Pussy got 'em gone sour
Another one (repeated)
We losin' real niggas by tha hour
Cuz pussy got him gone sour
Another one (repeated)

BOOSIE TALKIN' TIL THE END
