[Intro: Boosie Badazz]
Boosie Badazz, TIP, every woman wanna be spoiled

[Hook: Boosie Badazz]
I know you got wants, I know you got needs
I know you got plans, and I know you got dreams
Know you got a man that you probably wanna leave
But tell me girl, do you know what rubber bands mean?
Girl let me spoil you, let me spoil you
Girl let me spoil you, let me spoil you
Girl let me spoil you, let me spoil you
Girl let me spoil you, let me spoil you

[Verse 1: Boosie Badazz]
New Celine purses, girl I know you're worth it
I'm the one you looking for, there's no need for you searching
For dudes who are worthless, you got a special person
But he ain't doing what he 'posed to do, spoil you
Just point to where you wanna go, tell me what you wanna do
Wanna get in school, I got hookups, all that LSU
Tell the truth, you tired of hitting them all, window shopping
Deep inside you really want somebody really got it
I really got it and I'm really tryna call you
Take you shopping, girl I'm really tryna spoil you
You too bad to not have bags and heels
I got a spoiling invitation, let me know what it is

[Hook: Boosie Badazz]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Wait a minute, hold it now
Whatcha doing ma
Chances I had plenty I know
Just give me uno mas
Never accept advice from people who ain't as cool as us
Got nothing to do with us, let's keep us between the two of us
Because, if they could switch with you they would
If hurting you benefited them, don't think they won't do it
Well screw it
Know you can't tell a nigga nothing
When they think someone is something  and they turn out to be nothing
No matter how I try I go in and go off
She yellin, "fuck me harder", cum again in her mouth
From the car to the door, to the bed, to the couch
Tell her fuck that nigga take this dick
Girl this my pussy now

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Boosie Badazz]
You wanna get spoiled
Then I will make that happen
But its gon be other broads
I must admit it Im rapping
I turn a Micheal Khors watch to a Rollie right quick
This a golden opportunity you better not miss
Ace of Spades
We can drink like Kool-Aid, Lets do it
You need to listen to ya girl saying, "Just do it"
Im gon spoil you tight, call you like, "got a 1st class flight, come ball with me tonight"
But you gon have to come and give it all to me tonight
Diamonds all over you will make you shine bright
You got big dreams, then I can help you out fa'sho
It ain't what you do, but who you know
So let's go girl

[Hook]
