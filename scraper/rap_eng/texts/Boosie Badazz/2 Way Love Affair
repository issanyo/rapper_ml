[Intro]

Hold on let me answer the phone
Shut up (shut the fuck up)
Hello
What up (what up bae)
Shit just chillen (chillen mayne)
Man sometimes...
I just can't make my mind up
I love you though
(U know I love you rite?)

[Chorus]

I'm trapped
I'm caught up (caught up)
In the middle (in the middle)
Of a 2 way love affair
I'm trapped (I'm trapped)
Caught up caught up
In the middle (in the middle)
Of a 2 way love affair

[Verse 1]

I know I fucked up
I hurt you so many times
I know u tired of crying
(But but but but)
I apologize
Can you come and take a ride in my '45
Real talk I'm missing you
Kissing you and hugging you tight
And making love on sight(we fuck wherever)
When we together is the best I ever done
But when the love gets to deep
I run
But I love you though
Cause you on my mind every time I fuck another ho
That's how I really know
Late night counting paper with me (I remember)
Bubble bath, u used to cater to me
Don't wanna lose you to the streets
That's why every time we beef
I call ya like let's meet
(Fa real)
Shit done got too deep
You don't want to be my friend here
I gotta old lady n she been here

[Talking]

What's up man (what's up)
Why you tripping man
I'm made my mind up
What you talking about
What (what)
Fuck

[Chorus]

I'm trapped (trapped)
I'm caught up (caught up)
In the middle (in the middle)
Of a 2 way love affair
[repeat]

[Verse 2]

(Let me talk to u)
Say girl you know what's happening
You know what I do
The way she say she love boo
She can't be number 2
So we beefing she cheating
And I done lost love
Plus my real thang
Man I almost lost her
Wanna be with you sometimes
Wanna be with her sometimes
If I could have ya'll both
That'll really blow my mind
Sometimes I want to let you both go
But they get me in the bed
And they take me on that rodeo
Why u can't let her go
Cause I love her
And she been down with me from the shine
To the struggle
(U understand)
You a bad mothafucka
You say you love boo
What got me feenin for you
What got you feenin for me

[Chorus]

(Look like I'm)
I'm trapped (trapped)
I'm caught up, caught up
In the middle (in the middle)
Of a 2 way love affair
[repeat]

[Outro, talking]

This is a old hit (a classic)
I just brought that bitch back (like a fuckin flat top)
Boosie bad ass stop(you know)
I know they gotta alot of motherfucka trapped out there tonight
Can't make your mind up
That outside pussy a fool
Trapped
Caught up
Boosie bad azz
Turn me up
