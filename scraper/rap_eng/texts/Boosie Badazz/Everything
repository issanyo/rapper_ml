Seen my cousin get shot
Wit a 44 Magnum
Blastin'
Saw Lil Ivory laid out
On side his Benz
Wit all our friends dead too
Tragic
Turned on the tv today
Say my main man dead
From gunshots
Shot up in his Caddy
Diabetes mo than average
These the eyes of a Savage

[HOOK]
I done seen everything
I done damn near died
I didn't lose my mind
I done did everything
Seen everything
Did everything
Man I done seen everything
I done did my time
I done slung some iron
Man I done seen everything
Did everything

[VERSE 1]
I done hustled wit all tha hustlas
I done rapped wit all tha rappers
Lil Titus and Big Baby
I done trapped wit all tha trappas
Doodie, Bronson, and Donkey
I got a family full of jackas
I done had money in tha bank
And I done had money in a mattress
In tha hospital like
Mama
I'm up in pain
I just come from Death Row
This ain't a game
I just come from gettin cancer out my kidney
Feel my pain
My lil got 50
He stayin solid on my name

[HOOK]
I done seen everything
I done damn near died
I didn't lose my mind
I done did everything
Seen everything
Did everything
Man I done seen everything
I done did my time
I done slung some iron
Man I done seen everything
Did everything

[VERSE 2]
I done seen my own brother
Show me he ain't love me
It brought tears to my eyes again
I just seen my own cousin
Steal from her lil cousin
It brought tears to my eyes again
I just seen tha man above us
Change my big cousin (Trell)
Donkey prayin for our safety mane
I just lost one of my brothers
Rest in peace my nigga Busta
We gon forever ever rep ya name
Another funeral

[HOOK]
I done seen everything
I done damn near died
I didn't lose my mind
I done did everything
Seen everything
Did everything
Man I done seen everything
I done did my time
I done slung some iron
Man I done seen everything
Did everything

[VERSE 3]
I done seen my Mama hurtin’
But don’t ask for shit
I watched Lil’ Tulu go down
I seen the ratin’ shit
I lost 20 pounds in 13 days
Thinkin’ death
I felt tha cancer shit
Still he answered me (GOD Good)
I saw death so close
I was right there
I seen the balcony
All them unmarked cars
I seen them after me
Money make people look at you different
I seen tha faculty
Money make niggas spend all they wishes
I seen the athlete
Locked in that 6 by 6 jail
Boxed
Facin’ that needle
And not tha one at tha doctor
Doc I been needin’ to see you lately
Cuz lately my diabetes
It been shaky
I’m strictly out tha mud
Man I done met some niggas shaky
Gotta watch ‘em close when they gamble
And make ‘em shake em
Niggas be jealous when I start scorin’ a 4 and a baby
I seen our women turn evil
And play them games wit’ a baby
I done seen everything
Talkin everything
I done did everything
I done seen everything
I done seen Mama cryin’
Readin’ her bible
I done seen Daddy tear up tha house behind a lighter
I done seen Bosses go to jail
But only a few write him
I done seen niggas go in they cell
Lose hope and grab that rope
