[Intro]
Say, thug, I been seein’ rainbows all day
Shit, I got a blessin’
[?]
Rainbow, rainbow
Boosie Badazz
Rainbow, rainbow
Look at that motherfucker
Rainbow, rainbow

[Chorus]
Ridin’ in my Rover, Rover, Rover
Lookin’ at the sky and I see another rainbow
Thinkin’ ‘bout my future
Thinkin’ ‘bout my future
Hopin’ that there’s gold at the end of the rainbow
Drivin’ it like Future
(aw, shit)
Back to back, track for track
And I’m shinin’ like a rainbow
Ridin’ with my shooter
(shooter, look at Miley shoot)
Ain’t talkin ‘bout my nigga
Might be prettier than a rainbow

[Verse 1]
You don’t know my struggle
(nah)
If you knew my struggle
(yup)
You’ll say I deserve to shine bright like a rainbow
Walk everywhere freely
I’m a G, let my chain glow
[?] standin’ ‘round the yard, King Carter
So ride on the expressway
All I see is rainbows
Know He fixin’ to bless me
When I see them rainbows
Know I got some pots o’ gold
‘Cause I’m a good nigga
(I’m a good nigga)
From my walk to my talk
I’m a certified hood nigga
(uh huh)
Did for people, so God, he ain’t forget me
I been seein’ rainbows since the day I left prison
(hater)
Fuck a dollar, man, I stack ‘em by the fifty
White, red, caramel, I got some rainbow bitches

[Chorus]
Ridin’ in my Rover, Rover, Rover
Lookin’ at the sky and I see another rainbow
Thinkin’ ‘bout my future
Thinkin’ ‘bout my future
Hopin’ that there’s gold at the end of the rainbow
Drivin’ it like Future
(aw, shit)
Back to back, track for track
And I’m shinin’ like a rainbow
Ridin’ with my shooter
(shooter, look at Miley shoot)
Ain’t talkin ‘bout my nigga
Might be prettier than a rainbow

[Verse 2]
You know when the rain leave
Rainbows appear
And hoes left me on my [?]
Same hoes that [?]
It’s like the rainbow tryin’ to send a message
Huh, I probably got a couple hoes pregnant
Huh, I got that animal in me
That Hannibal in me
Example a nigga
Fucking vet, ain’t no amateur in me
I see the light at the tunnel
I fight with my hunger
Seein’ rainbows all day
I’m throwin’ dice, this a [?]
Junkie at the corner store ask for money
I gave ‘im 25
(25)
Seein’ rainbows soon as I hit 85
(Oh, 85)
God bless real niggas
That’s how the game goes
Can see my pretty bitch
But you can’t touch her
She a rainbow

[Chorus]
Ridin’ in my Rover, Rover, Rover
Lookin’ at the sky and I see another rainbow
Thinkin’ ‘bout my future
Thinkin’ ‘bout my future
Hopin’ that there’s gold at the end of the rainbow
Drivin’ it like future
(aw, shit)
Back to back, track for track
And I’m shinin’ like a rainbow
Ridin’ with my shooter
(shooter, look at Miley shoot)
Ain’t talkin ‘bout my nigga
Might be prettier than a rainbow

[Verse 3]
First in my feelin’s
Bein’ out my feelin’s
Now you tuned into thug talk
I’m the realest
God make the rainbows
My rainbows made millions
Had nothin’ as a child
Now I stack it to the ceilin’
I’m the man up in the buildin’
I’m the man to my children
All the fans say I’m the realest
Call me Mr. Rainbow
Yeah, I got the finer things in life
But I don’t change, though
You ain’t tryin’ to see the rainbow
Then what you in the game for

[Outro]
I used to ride with my soldier, soldier, soldier
On the corner, wishin’ we would see a fucking rainbow
Rap out the money, money, money
Try the heart of gold
I will always get a rainbow
Look at that rainbow
