[Intro]
Leave me alone, I ain't 'bout no trouble
But I could be
I'm just tryna get my cash again
They gon' make me turn into the bad guy again

[Verse 1]
I'm the type of nigga to give you a job if you say hi
But I'm not the type that's gon' let you slide if you rob me
At Six Flags on a roller coaster probably
Always shakin' a bacon at [?]
I don't bother nobody for real
I don't want me a robbery, I don't want me a body
I just beat about it, MJ and RayRay need their papi
Murder this shit, get sloppy
I'd rather be in Vegas droppin' this shit on the table
Winnin' big, picture in the waiter
Leave me alone, I just want happiness and family time
But I ain't no pussy, I'mma let you know, I'mma handle mine
Hope you don't call my call and dial cause I'mma answer, man
Shoot this 40 straight through your heart, I be your Valentine

[Hook]
Please, please just leave me alone
Ain't 'bout no trouble, but I could be
Niggas be talkin' like they gangsta
But if I bring it to 'em party just gon' tell on me so
Please, please just leave me alone
Ain't 'bout no trouble, but I could be
I'm just tryna get my cash again
But they gon' make me turn in to the bad guy again

[Verse 2]
I never started niggas, I never bothered niggas
I never talked at all, it was nothin', I slaugther niggas
Got a goddess, nigga, ain't got the time to be goin' to war with you
Cause if you don't know I know what a real street walker do
Niggas clap for you, all day 'bout to lunch for you
Never knew faces, always these same cases who down with you
I'm tryna put a million dollars, not tryna hunt for you
I'll spray you down, you goin' downtown and run your [?]
You want beef behind a bitch, watch what she do to you
Send you where the sun don't come out, signature nigga, Boosie crew
I just wanna feed my fam, act a ass on Instagram
Readin' everyday that I was in the pen, missin', man

[Hook]
Please, please just leave me alone
Ain't 'bout no trouble, but I could be
Niggas be talkin' like they gangsta
But if I bring it to 'em party just gon' tell on me so
Please, please just leave me alone
Ain't 'bout no trouble, but I could be
I'm just tryna get my cash again
But they gon' make me turn in to the bad guy again
