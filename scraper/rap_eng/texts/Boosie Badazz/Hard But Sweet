The way we was raised
It was hard, ya know
But at tha same time
It was real sweet
That’s why
We call it the Jolly Rancher Days
Cuz it was sweet ya know
Wasn’t no time like ya childhood
Even though it was hard
That’s why I call ‘em Jolly Rancher Days
Hard but sweet

[VERSE 1]
Tha way I was raised wasn’t nice at all
Stay at ya friend house
Next day you fightin’ ya dawg
Stealin’ pitbulls
Just to fight tha dog
Love hidin n go seek when tha lights was off
Trouble seemed to find us thug
One move out tha hood
It’s all good
Last words, keep in touch thug
This before we was fuckin’, kissin’, and touchin’
Eggin’ people cars
Pissin’ in public
Stealin’ reflectors, puttin’ ‘em on my new Benz
And I ain’t talkin’ bout a car
I’m talkin’ bout a Schwinn
Bicycle
Crazy how you be grateful for havin’ so little
Hard but sweet
Remember Calvin used to let a nigga sit in his Jeep
In a daze, turnin’ his wheel
Like his shit for me
Sunday, at tha park
Everybody actin’ foolish
Uncles fucked up
Aunties poppin’ they coochie
Jolly Rancher Days

[HOOK]
Hard but sweet
That’s why I call em Jolly Rancher days
Hard but sweet
That’s why I call em Jolly Rancher days

[VERSE 2]
Nigga knock on tha block almost everyday
First one go to sleep
Get tha toothpaste
A lot of stuff we did wasn’t real
Pickin’ on kids
Bein’ bullies for real
Learned early that it wasn’t no Santa Clause
Cuz Daddy tell us every Christmas
I got that for ya’ll
What he got wasn’t a lot
But it was all gravy
One kid got a Nintendo
We all played it
Couldn’t afford tha barbershop
So Bronson cut us
Cousin shot my cousin
Another struggle
But his comin’ home party was a muthafucka
So every dark day
We saw a brighter day comin’
Mama would say
Boy you bet not ask me for no money
Then turn right around and grab us
And tickle our stomach
Steal my cousin clothes
Rock ‘em like they mine
3 size bigger but it’s still a shine
This is tha Jolly Rancher days

[HOOK]
Hard but sweet
That’s why I call em Jolly Rancher days
Hard but sweet
That’s why I call em Jolly Rancher days

[VERSE 3]
Silk tank tops and silk boxers
Back then that was like real Versace
Hard but sweet
At first, gunshots would scare us
We would hit tha flo’
Got used to ‘em
Now them gunshots would turn to jokes
Old people in my hood ain’t really have much
But dope dealers looked out for ‘em
So they wasn’t sayin’ nothin’
But when tha dealers went to jail
It was a sad song
But it brought smiles
Seein’ tha next nigga jump on
Comin’ up I seen plenty they money long
Same niggas started hittin’ tha pipe
Now they money gone
Them was tha days
Water fights, clownin’ in tha projects
Get ya first piece of pussy
Tell everybody
Watchin’ my cousin sell crack
Gettin’ bankrolls
But they sellin’ it to our family members
Ain’t that cold
Sad when niggas hit tha pen
Leave they son and daughter
But nobody missed his comin’ home party
Hard but sweet
A lot of days it was hard to eat
But Auntie Margie would fill that void for me
We used to steal out tha stores
Sell candy at school
Go steal us some mo’
Dollar Now Laters wasn’t much long as we wasn’t broke
Go to tha pool
Act a fool, know what I’m talkin’ bout
But this was LSU pool
So they always put us out
Winter time we still had fun
Crazy how 1 cover can keep 5 kids warm
Jolly Rancher days

BOOSIE TALKIN’ TIL THE END
