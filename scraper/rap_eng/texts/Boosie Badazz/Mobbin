[Intro: Adrian Marcel]
Too cool, can't lose
We mobbin'
We mobbin'

[Verse 1: Adrian Marcel]
Pull up to the function, no roof
Reall here, tryna smokin' loud, grandad
Bouncers know the deal, we just walkin' straight through
I'm with my day ones, my niggas, my fam

[Pre-Hook: Adrian Marcel]
Every time you see me, I be chillin' with a few
And they all bad
You know niggas hate it when you poppin' and they lose
Got 'em all mad

[Hook: Adrian Marcel]
Pull up to the function, too cool
See 'em all, got me feelin' like I can't lose
We mobbin', we mobbin'
We mobbin', we mobbin'
It's on for the night, we mobbin'
What a night, we mobbin'
It's lit for the night, we mobbin'
What a night

[Verse 2: Adrian Marcel]
Woah, we goin' overtime
Someone tell the DJ play that one more time
Woah, it's goin' down tonight
I got hella options in your town tonight

[Pre-Hook: Adrian Marcel]
Every time you see me, I be chillin' with a few
And they all bad
You know niggas hate it when you poppin' and they lose
Got 'em all mad

[Hook: Adrian Marcel]
Pull up to the function, too cool
See 'em all, got me feelin' like I can't lose
We mobbin', we mobbin'
We mobbin', we mobbin'
It's on for the night, we mobbin'
What a night, we mobbin'
It's lit for the night, we mobbin'
What a night

[Verse 3: Boosie Badazz]
I'm mobbin' on the top, feel like I can't lose
Pocket full of guap, broke boy, I ain't you
Strapped on tight, we mobbin', ain't worried 'bout you robbin'
I got goons and goblins, room full of red bottoms
Boosie Bad on top, I got the Bay on lock
Bad chick mobbin' with me, bae hit so hot
Cali bud in the drop, it's all good, it's understood
That you mobbin' with the boys in the hood

[Verse 4: Too $hort]
She dance like she watch a lot of videos
She in the mirror twerkin', takin' off your clothes
It's lookin' like I'm 'bout to have a lot of fun
Two bitches and I still need another one
More bottles, order up, might not drink 'em all
It's bad bitch, playin' square like she don't drink at all
I'm used to it, the music make her listen up
And by the end of the night, she gon' be choosin', bruh

[Hook: Adrian Marcel]
Pull up to the function, too cool
See 'em all, got me feelin' like I can't lose
We mobbin', we mobbin'
We mobbin', we mobbin'
It's on for the night, we mobbin'
What a night, we mobbin'
It's lit for the night, we mobbin'
What a night

[Verse 5: M-City J.r.]
A few bad bitches with me
I got a light skin jawn sippin' on Henny
She say she comin' with me when the club over
Told her only thing that's opened up is legs and motherfuckin' Denny's
Rockin' Jimmy Choos, in the club with 4 or 5 bitches
I don't really need a boo, gotta catch 'em all like a Pikachu
When you see the dude, I be goin' hard like a fuckin' GO do
Niggas hate, I know you wish me was you
Where your bag at? Thought you had that
Girlie on me and her ass fat, what you mad at?
I got that, bag that, in a Louis backpack
Hunnid grand in the motherfucker, off a asscap
All my people mobbin' with me, let them niggas in the city
You can let them five bitches in too
'Cause they pretty, we gon' order some more Henny
We gon' sip until we busy
Me and Adrian inside this bitch lookin' like a milli

[Hook: Adrian Marcel]
Pull up to the function, too cool
See 'em all, got me feelin' like I can't lose
We mobbin', we mobbin'
We mobbin', we mobbin'
It's on for the night, we mobbin'
What a night, we mobbin'
It's lit for the night, we mobbin'
What a night
