[Chorus: Mouse]

Top notch whips that's what I drive
24 inches rims and tires
Hatin ass niggas can't believe they eyes
They starin me down, And I'm wondering why
Ah hold up wait a second
Let me think for a second
Ah hold up wait a second
Let me think for a second
Ah hold up wait a second
Let me think for a second
Ah hold up wait a second
Let me think for a second

[Verse 1: Lil' Boosie]
Red Bandana, Red Lexus
Top notch nigga hoes call me black and sexy
Top notch whip on that good drank from Texas
Got everybody lookin' like a nigga buck naked
Please be good cause it could go down
Mr. Baton Rouge, I hold the street crown
I fill it with gas, keep it clean as my ass
If I'm in that yellow thing I got on yellow to match
I would name my cars, but I ain't got time
Just got my fresh fade, check out my line
Ol' lady cross the street like "Ain't that Connie boy"
"That boy be on TV too, ain't that the same boy" (yea)
Feelin even better when I looked in the mirror
Diamonds on my teeth when I'm smiling at these niggas
From the car lot, to the rim shop we crawl and we creep
Southside young b that's how I come on these streets nigga

[Chorus x1]

[Verse 2: Lil' Phat]

Look, I got a Jag and it's sleepin on deuces
Funeral home my whips up my whip game stupid
I'm in the back seat, I'm in the back seat
At the light, open the door, showin my ass
You know how that be
Impala drop on the Shontaez
Oh it's the dumb way
Lil Mama takin pictures she saw me on
Rip the runway
Johnny got my neck right
Johnny got my mouth right
Ankle bracelet in diamonds so
Johnny got my walk right
I use 2 by 2's
Like ehh you stupid
Toilet paper niggas streets up
When It's time for me to use it
Take a picture of my hair cut
My Steve Harvey look right on
Yeah I know you see the ice on me
I'm on they cut the lights on me
Gucci bag 50 grand in it
Look don't put yo hands in it
Do it the dummy way
You catch me doin' my dance with it
Lil' Phat young boss if you don't know me
Ain't no waitin, Ain't no thinkin
Nigga you goin have to show me

[Chorus x1]

[Verse 3: Mouse]

(Why Why Hmmm)

Wound up lookin' cry baby like T.O
Don't blame me nigga, blame my C-E-O

Fuck a favor or a hand out, ain't shit free hoe
