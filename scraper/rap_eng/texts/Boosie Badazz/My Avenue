[Verse 1]
Hey, you can catch me on my avenue, I'll show you what this money do
Boosie Badazz!(Hey you can catch me on my avenue)Superbad! Yo turn up Boosie Badazz!
(Hey you can catch me on my avenue)
All I want is my paper, I don't care what they say
(Hey you can catch me on my avenue)
I wake up to get my cake up, I'm out here grindin'
(Hey you can catch me on my avenue)
All I want is my paper, I don't care what they say
(Hey you can catch me on my avenue)
Boosie Badazz! I wake up to get my cake up, I'm out here grindin'
Catch me on my avenue doing my thang
Everybody love me, people screamin' my name
I got the old folks bumpin' Boosie
Sorry but I got the Juvenile slangin'/shootin', but it's the streets
Five shows a week, hey! I'm getting paid (bling bling)
Choppin' on blades with my Boosie fade
I'm a hood role model, ain't nothing you can tell me
Street game, ain't nothing you could sell me
Just watch me, million dolla nigga, you could call me Ted Debiasi!
Been 'bout my paper, let's keep it real
I've been had the streets for the last five years
I wake up to get my cake up, red bone in the back I'm gettin ate up
Twenty five every show, I got my weight up
Ask somebody on my avenue (Shit, that Boosie Boo a paper chaser!)
(Hey you can catch me on my avenue, I show you what this money do)
All I want is my paper, I don't care what they say
(Hey you can catch me on my avenue, I show you what this money do)
I wake up to get my cake up, I'm out here grindin'
