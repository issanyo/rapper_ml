[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
She said "Oh my god I love you " I told that bitch stop it
You can come but we won't beg you know how we rocking
You can bring your friend we won't tell nobody
For to be inside that gang you gotta be a rider
You gotta be down to come and kick how I kick it
Me and my niggas we the realest you know we the sickest
We pull up on the scence mobbin' flexing with them benjis
We in the club popping bottles champagne shower living
Whole lotta hundreds in my pockets
I just popped a X bitch I'm out my body
Might as well approach me and stop all that watching
Come on let's get outta here you know I got it

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Niggas getting the picture but don't want to put me in the frame it's a shame
I rap harder than any nigga you name
From weed to caine I distributed all
And for everybody who want see Lil' Boosie fall man fuck yall
And throw up chain defenses
I'll go off like I'm Caine in Menace
Listen nigga I ain't finish
Look you niggas smiling in my face you ain't my round
I'll put that fuckin iron up in your face and lay you down
I'm thuggin nigga
I gotta Firebird and a cutlass nigga
And that whole south gon' ride if you touch it nigga
Now lets go hop up in the bucket nigga lets get high as the fuck
Show this nigga the consequences for drivin his nuts
I need a fifth of Mad Dog cause I'm finna act dog
Show this nigga how we livin cross the track dog
You better back off or I'mma hit this nigga with this hot shit
Just sit back and watch this
