[Hook: Lil Boosie]
Riding around with my Draco
I ain't got no Drake on, I ain't got no Drake on
G shit, say something
Riding around with my Draco, brand new, no tape on it
I ain't got no Drake on, fuck that my dog on
Riding around with my Draco
I ain't got no Drake on, I ain't got no Drake on
I got Murder Was The Case on

[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
I've been riding up and looking
When I find you lil pussy
I'ma slam you, and bam you
I'ma grab you by the pussy
Shit I'm from Louisiana, we call it Chopper City
Me and my partner stop the city, welcome to Chopper City
Mink coat, Draco
Keep that itty bitty boy in the back seat
Keep that itty bitty boy in the trap geeked
30 more in the clip on the back seat
I ride and I listen to Boosie
I turn up the bass, I rub on (?)
I'm ready for missions to do it
I'm doing it nigga
Didn't want the automatic fire on your pussy ass
You know I'm bout to ride on your pussy ass
Head down when you see me
Can't even look a nigga in the eye with your pussy ass

[Hook: Lil Boosie]
Riding around with my Draco
I ain't got no Drake on, I ain't got no Drake on
G shit, say something
Riding around with my Draco, brand new, no tape on it
I ain't got no Drake on, fuck that my dog on
Riding around with my Draco
I ain't got no Drake on, I ain't got no Drake on

[Verse 2: Lil Scrappy]
I'm a country nigga, run the city
Got a team of killers and they riding with me
Money thing gon' bring envy
Can't play fair cause these suckers iffy
I fill the cup up with Henny
Paranoid, ride with the semi
It ain't no rest for the weary
With the tool I can see clearly
Bump all y'all (?)
Young niggas swipe a credit card
Real ones gon' take the charge
Mouth closed stead of acting hard
Hate when niggas acting like a broad
In your eyes I can see the fraud
End up snitching on his whole squad
Real nigga, won't spare the rod
I'm riding around with the banger
The police, they getting the finger
Full of that liquor and flavor
Waving that thing out the Wrangler
I don't agree with no haters
Spectators are really debaters
I'm I'm into chasing the paper
Straight up, I don't need a chaser
Riding around with a bankroll
Rest in peace my nigga Bankroll
Streets go when I say so
(?) with that Draco

[Hook: Lil Boosie]
Riding around with my Draco
I ain't got no Drake on, I ain't got no Drake on
G shit, say something
Riding around with my Draco, brand new, no tape on it
I ain't got no Drake on, fuck that my dog on
Riding around with my Draco
I ain't got no Drake on, I ain't got no Drake on
I got Murder Was The Case on

[Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
Got the semi automatic rifle in the backseat
Three deep in the Cherokee
Street sweep three deep, where you gon' run bitches?
You scared of me
Being a bitch, I will never be
I'm on that 2Pac feeling heavenly
I ride down the street with my weaponry
I ain't in the mood for (?)
I'm Ox, I hope they don't Belly me
Ride late night with your thug, how the thug life
(?) fucked up looking at the club lights
Riding with my nigga with my finger on the trigger
Let me fuck pussy nigga ain't got no Draco
My lil nigga just got out the groovy
He jumped in and told 'em put Boo on
Went and got in my Chrome 25 and took 'em a ride through the school zone
Turnt up on that gangster shit
I'm in my zone, I've been getting bands
My niggas be turnt up on that gangster shit
Lotta lean and a lotta Xans
Nigga hanging out the window when it hit the fan
Nigga come and get the money, put it in the bag
Got a hundred round drum, bitch don't run bitch
Free my cousin (?) and that nigga Chad

[Hook: Lil Boosie]
Riding around with my Draco
I ain't got no Drake on, I ain't got no Drake on
G shit, say something
Riding around with my Draco, brand new, no tape on it

Riding around with my Draco
