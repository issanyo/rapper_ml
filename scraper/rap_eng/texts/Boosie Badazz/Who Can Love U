[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
Now from the introduction badass
He had you blushin,my first discussion
Was strictl if all this body touchin
Kissin and huggin she fillin her head in the pillow
I kiss her tattoo on her back
And stroke her on her from the back
And i put in on her from the wall to the bed
Fine red she starrin she ain't scared she gon hit me with that head
She comin, im commin we both close our eyes
She call me rollercoaster she love to take a ride
Say she ain't met nobody yet the could last long
Sometimes i need ex just to lawst longer
And i feind for her and part of my mind stay on her
Put her body in a coma

[Verse 2: Lil Boosie]
You know i like to be with you
Make love and sleep with you
Squeeze ya tight from behind
Especially christmas time
Noone can love you better, i promise
Gotta brag and tell sista's and her mama's
Like "that boy a fool"
Pay ya dues, ill buy you shoes and the finer things
The diamond rings ooh.. i love yo body frame
Who gon love ya, who gon touch ya
Like a thug do
Drop you off and pick you up makin love too
Love everything from to your smell to your belly ring
She keep it clean, ain't gotta tell her about her hygiene
(thats my bay) MAN !
And she touch me in the rite spot
Know how to get her ready i know her hot spot

[Bridge: Bobby Valentino]
Baby come on over
I got some things in store for you
Jacquie's hot, candels lit
And you know we gon be sippin'
Baby when you get here
Imma give it to you
(nobody) gon chop you on the late night
(nobody) can change your life with just one swipe
(nobody)them nails and that hair right
Imma be be be beat that thing all night
