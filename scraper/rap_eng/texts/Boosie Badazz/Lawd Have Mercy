[Intro]
South Baton Rouge this the baddest place in the whole wide world stand up y'all lawd have mercy...
Yah man remember the baddest place in the world South Baton Rouge lawd have mercy... Roosevelt Street Project Nigga (boosie badazz)

[Verse 1]
Fresh off the project step is Boosie
We went from shooting Uzis to shooting movies
Mr cogee man you can't take that from me (ah ah)
One shot for Ivy, he showed me how to save money
Walking to school with a tool and a bag of weed (fire)
Never knew that the feds would be after me (oh)
Casualty after casualty it's real
I hustle on the hill where walter got killed (woah)
Seen alot of shit man I did alot that's probably why it took so long for me to hit the top
Ask nuck I don't back down from shit
I was small as a bitch I ain't back down from wick
I slung eye with everytime grinding till I shine (let's get it)
Dickies and tee'z till I made my first fifty g'z So tell me why a pussy nigga hate on me we from the same hood South Baton Rouge

[Hook x2]
Can't knock my hustle
Lawd have mercy
Can't stop my shine
Yah man
Shoul ain't my friend
Lawd have mercy
Can't even look in ma eye (but u know one thang)
Yah man

[Verse 2]
Pick them out line them up like jeezy say
Niggas can't out hustle me on a freezy day
I need a duffle bag bitch like weezy say
Any nigga steal from me will steal off Jesus' plate
Hard times in the ghetto we was lost
No school no job me and Busta rob
Became a boss took losses couldn't cry nigga
Sucked it up told my main man double it up
When my label wouldn't drop my shit
Ain't get mad I went got them bricks
I had a Jacob like 50 cent
In '04 got my paper acts in me nigga
I get my grind on house 3 stairs had it for 2 years
Still ain't satisfied that's how scopio's is
Hot like hot fries Southside baptized bitch am a hustler you can see it in my eyes eyes

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Guess what? next up is the haters
They test us but get ate like sweet potatoes
Heads bust niggas go running to the people
But swear to god that they thugging like it's legal
Wake up call every morning call my manager up T.Q
I need cash or your ass get bust and that my big brother
Save change 8 gallons already saved trust funds man my kids alreadyy paid
Still gamble shoot the 50 with my with my real niggas
Still scratching off the lotto tryna hit it big
So my hustle a mothafucka man you feel me man
Hustle cross the track call me Penny Wayne
Money stash to the side I got a load of it
Facing to gun charges I need more of it
Steady thuggin reppin my hood till I die
Kingpin of the Southside certified

[Hook]
