[Chorus: Yung Dre & Yung Bleu]
Girl I'm all about you and I'm still about you, I can't be without you
Get to reminiscing, I can't wait to touch it, got me thinkin' 'bout you, you
Girl I'm all about you and I'm still about you, I can't be without you
Get to reminiscing, I can't wait to touch it, got me thinkin' 'bout you, uh

[Verse 1: Yung Dre]
I stay with them vultures, we stand on them couches, we be poppin' bottles
I be in my mood, loaded in my shoes, coolin' with some models
I just want the hoop, she just wanna do, understand her view
You a fool, thinkin' she gon' put a baller down for you
I'm the truth, I be with my goons
If I fall will you help me up or is you gon' move?
I can feel your heart with my eyes closed
Good brain got my mind gone
Love it when I side stroke
Licking on you, you might hit a high note, might hit a high note

[Chorus: Yung Dre & Yung Bleu]
Girl I'm all about you and I'm still about you, I can't be without you
Get to reminiscing, I can't wait to touch it, got me thinkin' 'bout you, you
Girl I'm all about you and I'm still about you, I can't be without you
Get to reminiscing, I can't wait to touch it, got me thinkin' 'bout you, uh

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
I be thinkin' 'bout you, I be wantin' to call you
I just hang it up, fuck it, I just hang it up (yeah yeah)
When we get to vibing, you know everything inside me
You really feel when I'm changing up (wow)
Keep it real, you been bad since high school
Barely can walk in heels, nice ass since high school
You lead but know the real, we been tight since high school
Always caught me when it's real, so when it's real I got you
When I get your love I can't get enough
I know you miss a thug, baby hit me up
I'm still about you, I'm the one who bring the real up out you
Christmas coming, I don't want be without you

[Chorus: Yung Dre & Yung Bleu]
Girl I'm all about you and I'm still about you, I can't be without you
Get to reminiscing, I can't wait to touch it, got me thinkin' 'bout you, you
Girl I'm all about you and I'm still about you, I can't be without you
Get to reminiscing, I can't wait to touch it, got me thinkin' 'bout you, uh
