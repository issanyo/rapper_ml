[Verse 1:]
Back in the ghetto, be real or be wanted
I have done bad
I hurt all my lovers
Stop hanging with nigga
These niggas be funny
Had to sit down and see who are my hommie
I’m talking to Vital
Boy send me some taco
From in the pack Imma run now
It’s nachos, don’t trust me nigga
I don’t really love these bitches
I’m focused on my riches
What you tryna get little nigga, ugh
What you want a bet a little brick
Got a annoying  nigga keep a good ticket
Trap in the cab and my bitch stay tripping
I’m getting that money, have no time to listen
I’m not gonna pack up like us on the list

[Chorus:]
My matching designer make these bitches want me
Might try park her up on this but this ain’t my corner
The way I’m finest make they really want me
And when the pack touch down
I’ll make her really want it
I know she really want me [x2]
I know she really want me
They really want me
I know she really want me [x2]
I know they really want me [x2]

[Verse 2:]
She think I’m gonna make her rich
Just conversation in dick
I cannot trod with a hoes
Honestly that’s how it goes
Momma been told me that woman would trap me
So you better strap it down nigga, for real
Cause now that a walk in a place
I want to grab the baddest bitch in the building
Toes hurting
I be chasing commons
Please think before a nigga run up
Hit my line about a random thirty
When they look they want the anaconda
Tuti Fruti got damn Judy
If she got a nigga
Then you might be loosing
Risk game make the vision blurry
She don’t even care how a nigga looking
Fuck with a kid like that
Like a nigga I thought her
These niggas garbage is basically litter
Put you back down and toss you like a flipper
You not a rapper please don’t let me get you
Stunting is  behind me but that is expected
It’s gone by the time these bitches get naked
All you might do for you and your family
I know that you really want me shorty

[Chorus]
