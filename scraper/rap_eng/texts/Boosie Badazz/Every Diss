(Hook X 3)
Every diss is like another love letter
That chopper help a nigga thug better, thug better
I'm strictly bout whatever, cocaine seller
Leave a nigga brain on Jewella
Every diss, every diss

(Verse)
Left a nigga brain on Jewella
That boy there was another level, the devil (the devil)
He died with his foot on the pedal
He still owe Johnnie for the (?) but whatever (but whatever)

Me and my lil' partners, all of us got cheddar
Birds of a feather flock together, my nigga
Got the walk with the Glock with the 20 round shot
See all of y'all gonna get shot together, that's better (they let em)

Lemme find out that you can't react on the pressure
And your tattoos ain't special I'll bat one of you niggas
Smack one of your niggas, drag one of you niggas
If you laugh, I'll do math, I'll subtract one of you niggas (one of you niggas)

(Hook X 2)

(Verse)
Me and my lil' partners, all of us got bodies
Don't know why we ain't school when all of us solve problems
Strictly 'bout whatever, kiss your love letter
To the head with that metal, Garfield - Roosevelt-ya

Mobbin' on em, eyes cocaine yellow
Blanch coke,  me and Ivan real cocaine sellers
What the fuck? I put you up, aint no game, Im a beast
Make me rewind this track, we was swangin' every week

Have me last on the pedal
Stetched on Jewella, mama like I knew it, she blamed it on the devil
Any nigga talk a lot, probably ain't 'bout shit
South side, death row, I'mma slang this bitch

Blood niggas, crib niggas, man they buy my shit
I might send one of them niggas to start a riot in this bitch
Its the bars out the bricks, we got 40s with dicks
Fuck a diss, just a look will get you slaughtered right quick
Boss man

(Hook x 2)

(Verse)
Eye ball no scale with that cold cup
Wife beater, my boxers with that chopper under my sofa
Whole another level from you no mind to peons
Catch your body, then I celebrate like Im Deon

What is this? Hey listen, red light ditched them
Twelve mile bayou they gone find you with the fishes
Every diss is like another love letter
But every gangster know that chopper help em thug better

Remorse, we can't show that, just show us where that blow at
You hesitate by doin it, Imma show you what the flow at
Every diss is like another love letter
They gonna find you in that bottom, they ain't gonna find you on Jewella

Cold case, cover on if they ain't see nothing
That chopper get they mind right, I know it ain't gone be nothin
Send yo goons, send my goons
Yours ain't gone make it
Send em back in a body bag with a leather ring stop fakin' nigga
