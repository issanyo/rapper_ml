[Verse 1]
I ain’t going back to jail bro
Nasty ass food thug
Can’t sleep on lock down at night and shit thug
I used to love when my kids come visit me
But tears in my eyes when they leave
Cause I can’t leave with them you know
I ain’t trying to go through that shit no more
I’m through with that shit forreal

I go back to that mother-fucka
They go talk about me like a dog
And this why

[Hook]
I don’t wanna go away
Cause I know how these bitches play
I just wanna ball and stay
Don’t wanna grey off in that place
Free, well , food still on my plate
Don’t want no CO’s in my face
I don’t wanna go away
And miss my people everyday
Cause if I’m locked up I can’t get paid
Or hear none of my records get played
Or put more money in my safe
Had me wishing I would have stayed
I don’t wanna go away

[Verse 1]
I don’t wanna go back
Nigga go change and I know that
All my little change they go blow that
No drink back asking where the 4 at
I know they get grimy so
Don’t wanna hurt momma no
Don’t wanna eat slob no more
I wanna eat, pop a dough
Probably hit the booth from Atlantic
Hoes go jump out the Boosie Titanic
With the quickness
Niggas go turn into bitches
Michael Jordan don’t need pimping
Who go answer everytime I call
Who go take my lil boy to the mall
Can’t leave cause I’m up in my prime
But the bigger the harder they fall
Did years behind that wall
Tears behind that wall
Fight kick throw shit
But I promise you
Bitch no fear behind that wall
Rather Roll in my Rolls
Cut my hair when I want to
Bath when I want to, ride in ma slab when I want to
If I go right back man I know what they go do

[Hook]
I don’t wanna go away
Cause I know how these bitches play
I just wanna ball and stay
Don’t wanna grey off in that place
Free, well , food still on my plate
Don’t want no CO’s in my face
I don’t wanna go away
And miss my people everyday
Cause if I’m locked up I can’t get paid
Or hear none of my records get played
Or put more money in my safe
Had me wishing I would have stayed
I don’t wanna go away

[Verse 2]
I’m good right here I ain’t tryna go nowhere
If it ain’t about freedom if it ain’t about money
You ain’t go see Ro there (see Ro there)
Hating ass niggas tryna make me lose my cool
But I ain’t gon go there
You already know the king of the ghetto
A fool will leave a nigga with no hair
Then ima have to get a bond
Ima have to get a lawyer
Ima have to press for the docket
Up early in the motherfucking morning
Let the metal detector take everything out my pocket
You know i’m pose to be drop head
With a bad bitch all up in her
Till she telling me to stop it
I ain’t nothing but a baller tryna shoot my shot
The judge and the prosecutor tryna block it
It’s all go my deep ends like man to man
They wanna catch me selling something hand to hand
No roof Chris commissary bag in hand
In the penitentiary wishing for a dark caravan
And all my real niggas doing that time
I know they feel me
For something I had in my pocket
I’m looking at a dime they tryna kill me

[Hook]
I don’t wanna go away
Cause I know how these bitches play
I just wanna ball and stay
Don’t wanna grey off in that place
Free, well , food still on my plate
Don’t want no CO’s in my face
I don’t wanna go away
And miss my people everyday
Cause if I’m locked up I can’t get paid
Or hear none of my records get played
Or put more money in my safe
Had me wishing I would have stayed
I don’t wanna go away
