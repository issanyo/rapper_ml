[Intro: Yung Bleu]
Started off with no cash, I got my own dough
I was just a young nigga trapping out the store
I told mama when I make it we ain't never going broke
I told mama when I make it we ain't never going broke
Been too many years, been too many tears
I lost my brother to the gun, mmh
Started off with no cash, I got my own sack
I was just a young nigga running through a bag
I say daddy when I make it we ain't never going back
I say daddy when I make it we ain't never going back

[Verse 1: Yung Bleu]
Young street nigga with a pocket full of franklins
Pull up on your set, I don't really know what you thinking
Pull up on an opp, you get wrapped in a blanket
I just got it wrong, I'm in a whole 'nother ranking
Never catch me lacking, keep a ratchet up for safety
Straight out Alabama, bullets make you do the Matrix
I came from the bottom, they been fucking with me lately
Stack it to the ceiling, that's a whole lot of faces

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
Started off with no cash, I got my own dough
I was just a young nigga trapping out the store
I told mama when I make it we ain't never going broke
I told mama when I make it we ain't never going broke
Started off with no cash, I got my own sack
I was just a young nigga running through a bag
I say daddy when I make it we ain't never going back
I say daddy when I make it we ain't never going back

[Verse 2: Yung Bleu]
I stay at the Continental with my bitch now
Them niggas use to shit on me but I'm the shit now
Pull up in something foreign with the kicks now
They be like Bleu you really think that you the shit now
I'm balling hard and you can't even pay your rent
I got these bitches waiting in line for the dick now
My diamonds doing the rodeo, I got 'em sick now
I got em sick now
I just spent a hundred grand with my jeweler (my jeweler)
Got me looking cooler (cool)
Spent a hundred grand with my jeweler
He got me looking cool

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
Started off with no cash, I got my own dough
I was just a young nigga trapping out the store
I told mama when I make it we ain't never going broke
I told mama when I make it we ain't never going broke
Started off with no cash, I got my own sack
I was just a young nigga running through a bag
I say daddy when I make it we ain't never going back
I say daddy when I make it we ain't never going back

[Verse 3: Boosie Badazz]
Promised mama if I make it we was never goin' back
They askin' can she have that and borrow that, 'cause I'm a hustler
Promised mama if I make it she can throw away this ugly ass Chevy
Made it, got my moms a V, 'cause I'm a hustler
At twenty-three I got a mansion, been never goin' back
Lorraine said the same thing, no hen never goin' back
Who want go back up in the hood with niggas now condoning rats?
Settin' traps and getttin' niggas' phones tapped
I know you smell me, I'm on fire, I'm the sauce up in the bayou
I'm the one who motivate you, make you try to
Get money, we ain't never goin' back
Hell yeah, tell 'em how it started

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
Started off with no cash, I got my own dough
I was just a young nigga trapping out the store
I told mama when I make it we ain't never going broke
I told mama when I make it we ain't never going broke
Started off with no cash, I got my own sack
I was just a young nigga running through a bag
I say daddy when I make it we ain't never going back
I say daddy when I make it we ain't never going back

[Outro: Yung Bleu]
Been too many years, been too many tears
I lost my brother to the gun, mmh
