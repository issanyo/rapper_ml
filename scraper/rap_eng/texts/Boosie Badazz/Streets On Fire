[Hook]
From the corners
All the streets have fallen
I picked upon, and grew a rose
I became the wildlife around Earth
And the book about her past has surely closed

[Verse 1]
No one thought I would make it
Violence and paper chasing
Supposed to be dead I'm just glad god had his patience
Broken relations cuz this rose turned into a flower
Trained to survive and learned all my surrounding
Look at my eyes, the wildlife defines me
Everyday is a hustle, so having nothing reminds me
Poverty couldn't blind me, fans never mind me
Found a gift and grew up, hoping Puff will sign me
In time the, boy who turned man,they understand me
I didn't win every fight but a nigga never ran me
Momma looking at me and smiled bright cuz it's over now
Whats over now? Pyrex and baking soda pots
50 for a rollie watch
No more corner, no more tryna hide
I get what I want and I can give a real nigga diploma
In the streets the real nigga Obama, just took a different role
A place that's called that's not far from the corner store
The corner

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Family hurtin' and I got tired of that shit
So I got off my ass and tried to get rich
Boosie got 99 problems and 5 of a bitch
Cuz I got 5 baby mommas with 5 different personalities
Blame for cold casualties, corner talk
Stuck in a place where them real niggas walk, the corner
But first your love hanging, then slangin'
You need love and fear love, you start banging
Music game changing, but Boosie ain't changing
Features with the stars, but my music still gangsta
It's for my niggas on the corners, hoping they get famous
With no gunshot wounds and leave pain, please help them lord
All the shit we see, we deserve to get a blessing lord
Look at me a G, I make the whole world press record
For that lil boy I give him hope
To stop selling dope, and put that mic to his mouth
And rap, and make it off that corner

[Hook]
