I know Kanye still hurt
I know I’ll still be hurt

[VERSE 1]
I still feel like I remember the first day I saw you in person
Years of you hurtin’
I blame me, and that’s for certain
When I turn back the curtain
My heart bleed from hurtin’ you
A teacher at school
Then comin’ home to teach a goon
Sendin’ letters to prison
Like son “I love you, see you soon”
When we had no cover
Me & my brother had you
You kept us warm Ma
Poverty livin’
Thanksgiving, we beat the storm Ma
Ain’t no woman like you
Ain’t that tatted on my arm Ma
Go to jail, call you
Get sick, I call you
Got rich, I brought you
For every time that you cried
Every time you stood right there
And I looked in yo face, and lied
And you knew I lied
But you still smiled
And said I love you
That’s my muthafuckin’ dawg Mama

[HOOK]
Mama (Repeated)
Mama I just want you to know (Love you Mama)
Mama (Repeated)

[BRIDGE]
And Mama I just wanna say I love you
If I never say I love you like I need to say I love you baby
And Mama I just wanna kiss and hug you
When I think about our struggle
Now I spoil you, Happy Mother’s Day
For Mama

[VERSE 2]
Now this 2nd verse for every time
You brought them kids to see me in Angola
Every time
My soldier
Every time
I’m from that dirty
I was gamblin’ early
So she would hide my dice from me
But she wasn’t tryna hurt me
But Ma, we hurtin’
You, yo bible, and yo cigarettes
How I was livin’
How could I tell her no mo’ cigarettes
This was befo’ I smoked a cigarette
Will get in her feelings if you go to sayin’ her son ignorant
Knowin’ her son a thug
But knowin’ she raised gentlemen
Ma, I love you
What we been through
What we been through
But we got through
It’s ok
That’s my muthafuckin’ dawg Mama

[HOOK]
Mama (Repeated)
Mama I just want you to know (Love you Mama)
Mama (Repeated)

[BRIDGE]
And Mama I just wanna say I love you
If I never say I love you like I need to say I love you baby
And Mama I just wanna kiss and hug you
When I think about our struggle
Now I spoil you, Happy Mother’s Day
For Mama

[VERSE 3]
This for every time that I hurt you
Every time that I cursed you
Every time I hurt your heart
Ma I never did it on purpose
This for every time that you cried
Every time I looked right in yo face and lied
And you knew I lied, but you still smiled
And said, I love you
