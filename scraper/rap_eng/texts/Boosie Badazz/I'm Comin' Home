I'm coming home
Wait for me
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Wait for me
I'm coming home
Wait for me, wait for me
I'm coming home

Murder charges, drug charges coming back to back
Hoes jumping out the ship and they ain't looking back
She telling me to have faith but what heard of that
Since I got this charge of us I ain't heard that
I already told ya that I knew that I was coming home
Yo words ain't mad when you rolled back you thought I wasn't gone
I even told my dog to leave a message on your phone
Do you but be here for me just don't leave a nigga alone
My seller just got out the phone told me to leave em alone
Stank just murdered his son
He grabbed his chrome
Lit up his cigarette thought back before his jail came
Was easy to take over I already had the jail fame
3 of 4 bitches they told them lies
I told them I was coming home, they rolled their eyes
Security guard at my cell with a cold smile
What I told you at visit girl shit

I'm coming home
Wait for me
I'm coming home
Wait for me, wait for me
I'm coming home

They tried to take my life
The system did me wrong
So I prayed at night
Fuck that I'm coming home
Knew that If was coming home and I was coming home strong
Came on and murdered every fucking song that I got on
Phone ranging, its that money everywhere I go
I know that bitch stankin' I should have stayed
This nigga gettin' paid
I used to have a kind of side we did a little somethin'
But my new bitch rock first, Louis and Philly
Red light I get the picture, the phone block
I call and you hung up, I think I know wassup
Father god I think I've been betrayed again
Feel like they beat me like a slave again
So many counted bruises, when they read the line
But nobody knew the case, so I said it's mine
In the mirror working out trying to get it in
In the fuse tryna tell my friends in the pen

I'm coming home
Wait for me
I'm coming home
Wait for me, wait for me
I'm coming home

I'm home now
I'm on now nigga
Gettin' that bag now nigga?
I see now nigga
God don't sleep, don't sleep
My [?] told a lady, she say you can talk bout my nephew right now

And my nephew he coming home baby
