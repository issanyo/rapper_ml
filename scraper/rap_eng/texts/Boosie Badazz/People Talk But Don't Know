Yo Yo Yo Yo

Damn

[Verse 1]
Heard what they said about me (You heard?)
Do you believe what you read about me
Say my friends wouldn't be dead without me
I heard they're 'posed to be ,real talk, scared about me
Like I'm dead one talkin' (He ain't comin' home)
Even say I ain't hood no more (Why?)
Cuz they don't see me often
Made fun of my cancer
Like I was lyin' bout it
While my family cryin' bout it
So tell me why tha fuck would I be lyin' bout it (Huh)
Stupid ass
They threw jabs at my kids on Instagram
Now I give a damn
Hoe you hatin'
Send yo location
I'll send a killer clan
They say I tried to bribe tha police
When I had my pistol
You'll rather me talk shit nigga
Cuz you don't wanna see me whisper
Shhhhhh

[Chorus]
People talk, but don't know (Repeated)

[Verse 2]
They say that I'm crazy
They say I was raised wrong
Say my music was weak (What?!)
How can it be weak when it's deep
You just don't know nuthin bout tha streets
In court, I was called an animal
They say I'm a leader of wolves
Tha police
They lied up in court
All of this shit was coerced (For real!)
Tha people they talk in tha streets
Like they know everybody business
You bunch of bitches
Bringin' up names they think did it
You act like a whole fuckin' witness
Tell me this
Was you at the crime scene hoe? (Tell me that)
Did you see it from tha car?
If you saw it from ya car
Did you have on ya high beams hoe?
This how I know

[Chorus]
People talk, but don't know (Repeated)

[Verse 3]
Sticks and stones may break my bones
And words might even hurt me
But dirt on my name
They searchin'
My haters, they so thirsty
They said that they murked me
On YouTube, they said I died up in a car wreck
Said I had a fake rapper on stage
Rappin' for me
And ya'll bought that
What you call that
Deceitful motherfuckers
Evil motherfuckers
Ya'll cowards
Any nigga talk down on me
Yo mouth sour
They even down talk my women
Cuz them hoes wanna be my women
So they talk, but don't know

[Chorus]
People talk, but don't know (Repeated)

[BOOSIE TALKING]
Motherfuckers talk about ya like they know ya
Talk about ya like a dog
They don't even know what's goin' on

Talkin' bout other people kids
What about yo kids
Talkin' bout how people raise they kids
Where yo baby daddy at
What you got
What's yo goal in life
But you talk about everybody you see

Gul look, that hoe sha
No bitch, you sha
For worrying bout that hoe
But I understand what you do though

Talk, but don't know
