[Hook: Pimp C]
Got a young brown stallion and she twenty years old
When she pop it from the back you see that hairy asshole
Got a young red stallion and she twenty years old
When she pop it from the back you see that harry asshole
Got a young yellow stallion and she twenty years old
When she pop it from the back you see that harry asshole
Got a young white stallion and she twenty years old
When she pop it from the back you see that harry asshole

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
You can shave off ya pussy
You can whack yo shit smooth
But if you do bitch then my dick a never move
You hoes in the game but you bitches is lame
Because you don't know the score
You a stupid ass ho
Im'a show you what the deal you need a 4 inch comb
So you can get yo money right
Get yo fuckin paper on
Cause the tricks in the street
They wanna bury they meat
In a whole bunch of hair and eat a bitch derriere
Pimps up hoes down like the fuckin movie says
All these other motherfuckers talkin' down
Them bitches dead
I'mma tell ya what time it is in the South
Young girls gettin' paid, puttin' dicks in their mouth
You can suck on my nut
But you ain't never gonna break me
Cuz these other motherfuckers don't know they can't shake me
I'm a real
You a motherfuckin' faker
I got bitches on the track
Sellin' tricks their moneymakers

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well it's Big Bun B AKA your big daddy
Comin' down on the big body benz or the caddy
Smokin' on the patty, filled up with the good
Grippin' on the grain, drippin' stains in the hood
Leather and the wood, pretty lady and the chrome
Comin' down on the fo's, gettin' my shine on
So when you see me leanin' on the buck with the stitch
Hide yo' ho', cuz I probably finna fuck with your bitch
So when I'm in corner
With my playa-ass persona
Put my pimpin' game up on her
Guarantee that she's a gonner
Easy for you to get her but it's harder to keep
When that real pimpin' hit your boulevard on the creep
Now nigga you can beat, put dope in they lungs
But it don't even matter
I finna scatta' with ya hoes
Don't hate the playa, hate the game
You know how it goes
Now go on and keep it pimpin
And send me the bitch clothes

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Webbie]
Well excuse me, let me introduce me
It's young Peezy got me leanin' in here like a G
Every time I come to PA
I hook up with B
And we smash up the A-Town for some bad b's
Purple trees, I believe I'mma get my cheat on
20 thousand dolla' mink
They thought I was Sweet Jones
Red bone, pretty thong
She done got me feelin' on
I'm really strong, clear as stones
Man a nigga really on

[Verse 4: Lil Boosie]
I got a bad yellow bitch
When she bust it back it's pink
Her pussy hair softer than the feathers on my mink
Fresh outta school, ball up in this
Young, and super fine
Told her how to rub my nuts when I fuck her from behind
I ain't lying, she a dime
And she be 'round all them bad hoes
She love when I rub my hands 'cross her ass ho'
Pretty brown, pretty face, pretty toes
She a stallion and she stay on all fours
Lookin' back

[Hook]
