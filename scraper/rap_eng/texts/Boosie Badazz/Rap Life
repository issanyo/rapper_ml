[Intro: Solo Lucci]
Rap life
If I'm sippin' Sprite then it's muddy
(if I'm sippin' Sprite then it's muddy)
These niggas, these niggas, these niggas clowns like Krusty
These niggas clowns just like Krusty
If I fuck, if I fuck, if I fuck her once she gon' love me
If I fuck her twice then she lucky
My bitches, my bitches, my bitches bad with a whole lot of swag
If not I'll pass like I studied, swear

[Verse 1: Solo Lucci]
I hate the lil barbie bitch, ain't got a pot to piss
All on my horn, I am not rhinoceros
Flyin' in that foreign, lookin' like a lil rocket ship
You broke and I am the opposite
I'm with a poppin' bitch, ridin' behind five percent
Probably gettin' top and shit
She brought her friend with her, she like to watch and shit
I turn the antennas, get right on top the bitch
Flow so sick you think they mopped that bitch
You know my trap house full of ammo
That bitch jumpin' like it hopped the fence
I think I might go get a Lambo
Fuck the police, I'm gon' cop that bitch
I got a throwaway, that bitch got threw away
I get that work out like motherfuckin' two-a-days
Think I knew lipo the way I be movin' weight
I want the meal, go get you a plate, ooh
My draco hold 'bout a thirty
I'm Tiger Woods in the trap, I got birdies, ooh
A young nigga up like it's early
And I'm straight on all them lil hoes, used to curve me, ooh
I am perfection, I am a walking erection
I'm so high I defy gravity
All of these bottles, you think I bought me a section
I just love Actavis actually

[Chorus: Solo Lucci]
Bitch I'm Jeezy in the trap, I'm like Gucci with the strap
Bobby Shmurda of the South, I'll air a nigga out
I got Boosie 'round my neck, Zoey Dollaz with the check
Might go Kodak on these hoes, kill these bitches with finesse
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, rap life (woo)
Your favorite trapper's favorite trapper (I am)
Your favorite rapper's favorite rapper (that's me)
Your baby mama's baby daddy (woo)
Drippin' drippin' on these bastards

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Mean rich nigga, Mike Tyson
Like them tits, bitch with the ice on
In the club every night doin' fight songs
Rap lifestyle, one slip and your life gone
I'm your baby mama crush
I'm your nephew role model
I ain't gotta say suck it
I sure ain't gotta say swallow
My shooters, they shoot at Obama
I tell 'em to, this what I'm tellin' you
Niggas be clean as a bitch when they steppin' through
Nigga gon' step on you, ahh, step on you
Ball hard, do this every summer
Me and three hoes in back of Webbie's Hummer
Bitch wasn't eatin' that bad
But it was after the Waffle House, and my dick was dinner
It's a rap rap life, it started with the trap life
Real life really the field life
I can go in Fort Worth, Texas
And they'll protect me with Smith & Wesson (Funkytown, Texas)
Bad bitch with an attitude, nigga still got the pussy
Quarter million on the IG, final fifty on pussy

[Chorus: Solo Lucci]
Bitch I'm Jeezy in the trap, I'm like Gucci with the strap
Bobby Shmurda of the South, I'll air a nigga out
I got Boosie 'round my neck, Zoey Dollaz with the check
Kodak Black on these hoes, I'ma kill 'em with finesse
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, rap life (skrrt skrrt)
Your favorite trapper's favorite trapper (I am)
Your favorite rapper's favorite rapper (that's me)
Your baby mama's baby daddy (hee)
Drippin' drippin' on these bastards

[Outro: Solo Lucci]
Rap life, rap life, rap life, rap life
Rap life, rap life, rap life, rap life
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, rap life
