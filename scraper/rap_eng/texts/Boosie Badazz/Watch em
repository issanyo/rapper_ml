My haters they been gettin' a whole, whole lot of nothing
I can't help that I'm this hot, I'm so so blessed
You have fun wit' them robbers I'm so, so fresh
Everything I touch turn gold

Lately, its playboy mansion pussy might dig her
You don't no my struggle everyday, anotha bag ask the world who the man?
They gone tell you Boosie badazz
Doubted my freedom, now I'm eatin', they got whiplash
7- 45 on my wrist, right now I'm so rich
I can't help how you feel
'Cause you feel how you feel
I'm just gon' do me and continue to be too real
6 different hustles, how I'm bringin' in a new year
Thank God, real music been saved, Boosie Boo hear (They mad)

Queen of Trill I'm gettin' cash
My own crib, my own car
Sittin' back, gettin' money bags
I'm swimmin' in I, l-l-lone shark
Countin' checks, that GPS don't stop beepin' like da sound off
That navigation, lead me to the paper like Onstar
Them trap niggas they love me
Them whack bitches bow down to me
'Cause ain't none of them hoes above me
I'm so dope, I blow cash, you hoes broke that's yo' bad
You can't afford my tote bag, I'm killin' shit toe tag
See me in the whip, like deuces
Go hang ya self y'all nuisance
We turnt up, we turnt out
My liquor straight, no juices
Sip Amaretto in a Porsche Carrera gettin' bread, like I worked at Panera
Panoramic roof, poof disappeara, I reappeara in a Panamera
Lately, I've been gettin' money
I can't help how you feel
Baby you a real one, get hit, tell 'em real
You know me, I grew up straight up off fast money
That Maserati jag money, stop handcuffin'
Six twelves, old schooled that bitch, sound like a band don't it?
It sit up like a man don't it, I spent them bands on it
We get hoes, then we fuck, they gon' brag on it
You can talk that talk can you walk that walk, I'll A-Town dance on ya
Had my lil' bitch turn every song, into her dance song
Oh that ain't nothin', you should see her with no pants on
I first night my girl, my relationships don't last long
But it be so fun while it be lastin' and I last long
And she lick on my tattoos, while I blast on her
See that pretty pussy, see dats da one to call
Lately, I've been gettin' money
I can't help how you feel
Baby you a real one, get hit, show 'em you real
Show 'em you real
Show 'em you real
Show 'em you real
Show 'em you real
Lately, I've been gettin' money
I can't help how you feel
