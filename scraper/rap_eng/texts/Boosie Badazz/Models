[Verse: Boosie Badazz]
Red bones, black bones, horses, and stallions
Boosie fucked them all, I’m a motherfucking dog
You better tell them how we thugging tonight
And girl, you gon' have to suck it ‘fore you fuck it tonight
I got a model on the left, model on my right
Front my cash, bad ass, get swatted all night
Number 1 0 1 0 6, still I’ll fuck a ratchet bitch
I ain’t had to beat my dick since 1996
Fucked the grandma, the mama, the cousin, the niece
I’ll make you [?] if you’ll be my little freaks
Straight up, the player haters they gon' hate us
Girls bite us like gators, they give us thirty-one flavors
A straight go-getter, man I’m all about my stacks man
I make it rain and pick it up like Pacman
I’m gutta, you see your girl with me, I done already fucked her
Now I’m working on her friend, come over and join in

[Hook: Snook da Rockstar & Boosie Badazz]
There's models on the left, models on the right
In the VIP, popping bottles all night
Nigga, I'm fucking something (You know I'm fucking something)
Nigga, we fucking something ( Man, is you fucking something?)
'Cause there's models on the left, models on the right
In the VIP, popping bottles all night
Nigga, I'm fucking something (You know I'm fucking something)
Nigga, we fucking something (Man, is you fucking something?)
