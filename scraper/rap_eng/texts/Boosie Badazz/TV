[Intro]
Boosie Badazz
I knew I saw this shit on TV

[Hook]
I ain’t know if it was HBO, Cinemax, ShowTime, SciFi
BET, or TNT
But I knew I saw this shit on TV (I knew I saw this shit on TV)
This fucking boy should be on TV (I knew I saw this boy on TV)
I ain’t know if it was HBO, Cinemax, ShowTime, SciFi
MTV, or BET
But I knew I saw this shit on TV (on TV)
This dog ho should be on TV (I knew I saw this ho on TV)

[Verse 1]
This nigga started out a gangster though, I saw you in the movie, ho
Pitching out the pack behind his back, that’s a movie roll
Started as a kid with them, played on the same block
Look how they did Snupe, I heard they used to use the same Glock
I’ve seen Bishop off Juice grow up to a thug
When it was over, I shook my head, I knew what movie this was
My daddy pumping coke and spending, man
Uncles putting pistols in my hand, this is Menace, man
Indictments, the world thinking that I won’t see tomorrow
Trial was crazy, still walk, this is Law & Order
I’ve seen hoes come in and bait niggas and rob them at nighttime
I’ve seen these kind of hoes on Lifetime

[Hook]
I ain’t know if it was HBO, Cinemax, ShowTime, SciFi
BET, or TNT
But I knew I saw this shit on TV (I knew I saw this shit on TV)
This fucking boy should be on TV (I knew I saw this boy on TV)
I ain’t know if it was HBO, Cinemax, ShowTime, SciFi
MTV, or BET
But I knew I saw this shit on TV (on TV)
This dog ho should be on TV (I knew I saw this ho on TV)

[Verse 2]
Shit
Boys in the Hood, I was Cube in that drive-by
Smoking PCP, I saw some shit that be on SciFi
Seen mace get sprayed so much, it will fuck the cell block up
No visits to real niggas for years, I’ve seen Locked Up
I’ve seen women making scenes to get exposed
So I’ve seen these reality shows up in the four
Lord knows I’ve seen some shit, Paid in Full
Look like Bleek was Money Making Mitch
I’ve seen hoes turn niggas on their own niggas
I’ve seen niggas walk out on their own children
I’ve seen black families fall apart, get back together
So what I’m saying, I saw every flick from Tyler Perry

[Hook]
I ain’t know if it was HBO, Cinemax, ShowTime, SciFi
BET, or TNT
But I knew I saw this shit on TV (I knew I saw this shit on TV)

This dog ho should be on TV (I knew I saw this ho on TV)

[Verse 3]
This shit is TV, real characters was next to Boosie
Street wars, niggas dying, I’ve seen western movies
Seen dudes with no heart really murder guys
Fuck a nigga bitch, he went crazy, I’ve seen The Perfect Guy
Seen a big dog catch AIDS, first they used to love him, man
Now they’re beefing, what I’m saying, I’ve seen Straight Outta Compton, man
I’ve seen women get famous off their husbands’ shine
Then they shit on them, so I’ve seen The Real Housewives
Aunty fight and fuss, then she fuck the night away
But she love him, so I’ve been knew Joseline and Stevie J
I met a nigga up in prison who been there 45
He don’t even want to go home, so I saw The Green Mile
This is TV
