[Intro]
From the heart, Boosie Badazz
I cry and i sit by the fan
Sometimes I smile to keep from crying
They don’t know what we go through

[Verse 1]
You might think I’m happy all the time ‘cause you see smiles on my face
And my followers over 500K
But I been going through some problems today, hoping for better like big momma would say
But haters come for me, magazines, they run and they lie about the things that I say
It’s hard to keep a peace and smile even with bitches I date
Why do you hate and come for me, you want my problems, ho?
He raised wrong, damn woman, won’t be my momma, ho
I hope for change, I’m trying though
Just lost my thug, ripped him apart, yeah they sprayed my man
I cry, and I sit by the fan, somebody gon’ die today man
I’m looking for unity, I’m tryna make a better way for you and me
But people ain’t true to me, and honestly, I feel like they’re using me

[Hook]
They don’t know what we go through, bruh
Sometimes I smile to keep from crying
Sometimes I leave to keep from lying or spazzing
You want to be me, you couldn’t imagine
Tryna smile to keep from crying

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I need me a friend, I have no one to call
I need me somebody who listens, maybe I need me a dog
I wake up, I look in the mirror, I put on my clothes and I leave
If my life is beautiful, please, tell me why I need the trees, I’m going through
This world is so cold, it’s crazy, these cops are killers, they racist
If he was alive, he’ll be saying, “officer, why didn’t you tase me?”
I’m on parole, one feet up in jail, one feet out the door
Lost three aunties in just one year, this ain’t the rain, this is the snow
Thought she was real, mama was right, guess she a ho like that
‘Cause I went to the pen, she ain’t even write back, no love for a nigga, play a nigga like that
The cameras, they flash at the club, the haters they see me and mug, They hate ‘cause I blew, what the fuck? I feel like I’m India Love

[Hook]

[Outro]
I cry, I sit by the fan
I miss my granny and daddy
Want to be me, you couldn’t imagine
Tryna smile to keep from crying
I cry, I sit by the fan
