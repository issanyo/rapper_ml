[Intro]
Hey thug, nigga get full of that shit
Wake up the next morning and regret everything that happened

[Verse 1: Boosie Badazz]
Look, you can't be fucked up full of them drugs, nigga
Fuck around and get stomped in the mud, nigga
Drug like a rug fuckin' with thugs nigga
Shot up all your people, pullin' the plug nigga
Your homeboy gon' to die right at the club with cha
Take your shit and hope you have your plug with cha
You fuckin' with a G gon' make you have regrets about it
You won't forget and you gon' have to pay a check about it
I ain't with the bullshit so don't come with the bullshit
You gon' regret the bullshit, you check me 'bout some bullshit
No regrets, that was tatted on my old bitch
I think she lyin', plenty times she missed the old dick
Don't you regret when niggas testify on ya
Turn pesticide on ya, make ya want to ride on 'em?
He did what? We don't play that on my corner
Cross the line, we gon' spray that on my corner, nigga

[Hook]
Paid cash but he should have used debit (now he regret it)
Diamonds cloudy bitch you shoulda went to Texas (now he regret it)
Don't come 'round my neighborhood with all that flexin' (we gon' take it)
Them boys hoes, I hope you ain't talkin' me and Webbie cause nigga
You gon' regret it, you gon' regret it, you gon' regret it
Nigga, you gon' regret it
You don't respect it, than you gon' regret it
You don't respect it, than you gon' regret it

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Don't get in my way about him boy, you gon' regret you did
If it's beef, you better wet the kid cause I'm dangerous
Don't be talkin' gangsta shit if you ain't bout that all the way
Put you in the wheelchair, regrettin' you can't walk away
When you play with Gs, cross the trap, you can't take it back
Have your own people like 'why the fuck you play with that?'
Pockets sittin' major fat
Don't play with my guap, it's like a gangsta leavin' his pistol, man, the day he got shot
Why the squad jumped Orlando, the feelin' I got it
I was regretin' that whole incident when 'Pac got shot
Wonder do Ja Rule, regret not shootin' Fif up
Wanted to do Flip mane, regret not shootin' Tip up
It's a way of life, some niggas need to get zipped up
Fuck my set up hoe, you gon' regret the day you hit her, nigga

[Hook]
Paid cash but he should have used debit (now he regret it)
Diamonds cloudy bitch you shoulda went to Texas (now he regret it)

Them boys hoes, I hope you ain't talkin' me and Webbie cause nigga
You gon' regret it, you gon' regret it, you gon' regret it
Nigga, you gon' regret it
You don't respect it, than you gon' regret it
You don't respect it, than you gon' regret it

[Verse 3: Webbie]
You gon' regret it nigga
Believe that, nigga, look you gon' regret that shit
Huh
You gon' wish you never said that shit or did that shit
Gon' wish you coulda hid that shit or dropped that shit
Just found a way to squash that shit, got out that shit
No really you weren't 'bout that shit, but fuck that shit
When I see 'em, I'ma pop that bitch, believe me boy
I be like Beezy Boy, get a call a day while I'm out there
I'm telling you I'm out there, all the way
Pussy niggas fall away, real niggas stay for good
I ain't got shit but real niggas with me, me and my niggas we straight for good
You gon' wish you never got in that shit
That Savage Life, them Bad Azz niggas been that shit
Second guessin', no question, I betcha you'll be stressin' and shit
For blessings and just wishin' you never mess with the shit
From the home of the tigers and jaguars definitely
Like I'm from the Texas, it's just forever Trill for real, nigga

[Hook]
