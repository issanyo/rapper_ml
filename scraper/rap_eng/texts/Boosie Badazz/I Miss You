[Verse 1:]

Twin You Still Gotta Brother Muthafucka You My Thug Til The Day I Go
Wish I Can Spin A Block Wit Ivy And Joc

So Much Death In This World nigga ain't scared of nothing
Remember The Police They Killed My Nigga Nail Shawn On The Front Road Pulling Out A 8.(Damn)

[Hook]
Sometimes I Wanna Break Down And Cry
You Don't Know How Bad I Miss You
Neva Gone Forget The Times That We Shine
[X2]

[Verse 2]
Heard the news about his father's nightmare
He at home all along and he miss his dad
Pression on em all on his life to say daddy is killed
Momma strong out on the licor son selling momma flippers
It's a cold world
No my grandma looking down and my grandfather too
Mad at the choises a make but i'm a father too
Flip move a nigga don't say how much he miss ya
My thug brothers ? ? Rest in Peace this
Every gangsta cross the track in a fuckin' grave
From gunshots to AIDS life sentence they gave
They memories keep in here with me
That purple and that hennessy make it clear to see
They gone


[Hook]

A drank whole pin of Sizzurp for you cause you don't know how i miss you
I throwed a party every 3rd for you cause you don't know how i miss you
Never gone froget you nigga

[Verse 3]
This for every momma lost they child
Life ain't life no more
Cuz she lost another child
Remember feedin' his baby sending to the school
While his cold eyes ? ?
But she never forget
Mane sincerely ? i love you
I see so many kisses and hugs of niggas who gone
Like my nigga Ivy
Now the whole southside ain't smilin' they wildin'
They killin' niggas mommas in retailition
They talk about the old days but it's new generation
They get bread and bust heads in any situation
One shot for my Soulja head in soulja hell

[Hook]
