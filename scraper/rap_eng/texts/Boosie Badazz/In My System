[Intro]
I was set up to lose
I was set up for failure
Oh shit I feel ya
I'm not 'posed to be shit
Guess what though?

[Hook: Young Dolph]

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
You lean the pot and scrape the bowl and you get Dolph
My mom and daddy fucked around and made a boss
I clocked in when I was 12 and never clocked out
Tell me what you was doin' when you was 2 nigga?
Bitch you know what was a straight shooter nigga
13 walkin' round mad ready to shoot a nigga
Say you came from shit, prove it nigga
I saw Dae Dae get them bricks and run straight through 'em nigga
Then they turned and Dae Dae start smokin' (cocaine)
Fuckin' with a bitch and had her nose wide open (cocaine)
I said I'd never do that
I said it's time for me to change shit
Came up with another way to get rich
Nigga I'm my own big homie
Got a couple OGs though
Speakin' of OGs
Have you ever seen 60 of these though
All my cousins, they gang bangin' and sellin' crack
I learned early that niggas tellin' names and that's a fact

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Ain't got no brain
Daddy's sperm was full of cocaine
Cousin got life, they say he smashed a nigga for a whole thang
Of cocaine
Crack rock in my mouth in the plastic, I spit it out and hustle
My main man was the Birdman motherfucker
RIP it's killin'
My cousin shoulda told me go to school and read my books
Instead he took me to the kitchen and showed me how to cook
Cook in the livin' room, this no regular life
Sellin' that crack to my own uncles for the regular price
Cold summers and long nights when we was movin' that yay
.40 on me drivin' that night while Tunechi tootin' that white
My trap house I'm really tellin' you was full of coke and residue
They say coke is that ecstasy
If so it got the best of me

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
I don't wanna hear a nigga complainin' about shit
I took off and I came up without shit
They say "will you change up", I say "not for shit"
But I got zero tolerance for a nigga or a bitch
Mom and daddy, they doin' good now
Nowadays they tellin' me stay out the hood now
Daddy he was drinkin' whiskey on that coke
Now I'm smokin' kush back to back and pourin' fours
I'm from where the strong get money and the weak get exposed
I just sit back and observe and be like these niggas hoes
I had a bank roll before I had a name
I got cocaine runnin' through my motherfuckin' veins
