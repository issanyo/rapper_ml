[Verse 1:]
Big booty bitches
Beautiful tities
Dance on that pool
Hundreds and fifties
Fall from the ceiling back down to the floor
I can pay your tuition
As well as your rent, bitch I’m making the dough
I got nothing but benzes
Rocking them regular
On bundles and bundles and none of them fraud
Better turn up for that cheque bitch
Better show them who the best bitch
Show them you can work a rose
And you can pop a bentley
Make a nigga throw that dough until his pocket empty
Hold on, wait a minute, ooh holy shit
If them nigga ain’t tipping
Then they broke as shit
Better ask around and call me Mr. Throw It All
Bitch I just want to see you show it all

[Chorus:]
I want see some pussy
I want see some pussy
I want see some pussy
I want see some pussy
Show me the kitty
Show me the kitty
Show me the kitty cat
Show me the kitty
Show me the kitty
Show me the kitty cat
I want see some pussy
I want see some pussy
I want see some pussy
I want see some pussy
Show me the kitty
Show me the kitty
Show me the kitty cat
Show me the kitty
Show me the kitty
Show me the kitty cat

[Verse 2:]
I want see some pussy
Girl I’m boosting you
Make that pussy breathe
And, I’m gonna throw these blues
Rub your hand on it, then look at me
Turn up, get that pussy warm
Suck on your fingers baby girl
I’m gonna make it thunderstorm
Drop down from that pole
Now you got me cooking
I just got out of jail, so
I want see some pussy, please
Last week I buy hard
Me and baby do fifty balls
B.I.K.O.D when they all naked
I don’t do no titty balls
I’m on mine, my dick hard
If it’s all soft, you ain’t going to enjoy
Came in with a bad bitch
My bitch pick, my bitch for me
Drop a couple bottles now I’m lean
I stucked got everybody looking
Girl won’t pay your rent, well

[Chorus:]
I want see some pussy
I want see some pussy
I want see some pussy
I want see some pussy
Show me the kitty
Show me the kitty
Show me the kitty cat
Show me the kitty
Show me the kitty
Show me the kitty cat
I want see some pussy
I want see some pussy
I want see some pussy
I want see some pussy
Show me the kitty
Show me the kitty
Show me the kitty cat
Show me the kitty
Show me the kitty
Show me the kitty cat

[Verse 3:]
Darn it look so good
I know you want to grab it
But only if you could
You know you wish you had it
But know I’m not your average
This bitch too bad
You say you got that bad
But throw some money at me
Throw some money daddy [x2]
Throw some money dad
Throw them money dad
Throw them money
Throw this money dad
Throw some, throw some money (laughing)
Throw them money
