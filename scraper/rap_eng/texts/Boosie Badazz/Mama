[Boosie talking:]
I'ma send this song out to all the mama's who stand by their babies
No matter what they going through (right or wrong)
Especially my mama Ms.Connie
You know I love her to death
She stand by me

[Hook:]
Mama, Mama stand (ain't nothing like a strong mama)
By me
Mama she stand
Mama she stand (yes she did)
By me
Mama, Mama stand (love ya mama)
By me
Mama she stand
Mama she stand (oh lord)
By me
Mama, Mama stand

[Verse 1:]
Through all my struggles
Through all my troubles
Might got to look for my friends but not my mother
Cause she gon be there when everybody deceive me
When I'm lonely she squeeze me
When I'm hungry she feed me
Since elementary I be making mama hurt dog
Found my first .38
Found my first 8 ball
Up in prison you never missed a visit mama
Bringing 7 bad kids to see me mama, how you did it mama ?
And she gon stand by me the same way
If I had a billion dollas or a dollar she the same mama
When daddy hit her I cried
Staying with him she tried
I had to wipe my mama eyes when he died , damn
Remember you putting our bathe water on the stove mama?
So we wouldn't have to bath cold
I love ya lord knows
And when I'm living wrong she praying to God on her knees
One thing I know my mama stand by me

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I get in trouble call mama every time
Know when I'm telling the truth
Know when I'm lying
Know when my friends my friends she see the signs
See I'm blind
Never holding nothing in she speak her mind (that boy ain't real)
Look where we came from the hard times the struggles
Wouldn't be no Boosie without his mama that's why my fans love ya
If I could take it all back I wouldn't change a thing
I wouldn't change our love
I wouldn't change our pain
I hit the pen you change the pampers on my lil man
I love ya cause when I was a kid you did the same thing
Never tripped on material when she not my mother
She rather have a card , a note saying how much I love her
Everyday at my trial she had her bible with her
Her cigarettes and her lighter she fighting with me
She told my lawyer that she would get on the stand
And tell the jury that I ain't that kind of man
My mama stand by me

[Hook]

[verse 3:]
Mama gon stand by me in any situation
No matter how much time I'm facing she stand by her baby
And T lady the T is for terrific
We ain't have much but you made sure when had for Christmas (Thank ya mama)
Shaking your head when I'm expelled from school
But you still took me home and fix me some food
So , I want you to know that Boosie love you
And ian ever gotta ask do you love me too
Cause you show it in a million ways
And her love is one in a million like Aaliyah say
When I'm down she pick me up
She say the right things to lift me up
Cause she loved to see her son smile
And we close like 10 toes in a baby sock
Laugh about the past cause the hood we made it out
Woke up this morning and saw a picture of you
I got my pen and I wrote this one for you
Mama stand by me

[Hook]
