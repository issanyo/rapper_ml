Boosie Badazz
Ima 100 hit wonders
I'm never finished

[HOOK]
I remain a menace
Teflon from my hat to my tennis
They said I'd fall off but
I'm never finished
You other rappers finished
You niggas gimmicks

[VERSE 1]
It was so hard in tha beginning
Rappin' at Splashes in tha 7th ward
I'm tryna get it
My lil' bitch up out tha 3rd ward
She say Lil' Wayne tha sickest
Gotta say she kept it real
'Cause that nigga Wayne ain't finished
But Lil' B, I kept it solid tho
And I just did Boosie
Spit it from tha heart
When every car played Juvie
Whoever thought I'd have mo' rap fame than anybody in that No Limit gang
Have mo' diamonds shinin' harder than them No Limit chains
Yella Boy was big to me
T. Tucker a muthafucka
Ghetto Twins was my wife is you two fine muthafuckas
Damn
Nero was tha shit
Remember Sam I Am
Stayed strapped, stayed wit' real rap
Now here I am
Here I am

[HOOK]
I remain a menace
Teflon from my hat to my tennis
They said I'd fall off but
I'm never finished
Yo favorite rapper finished

Shit talk to 'em Badazz

[VERSE 2]
I was round for tha real G shit
Even before tha real weak shit
I was hot when Rich Boy threw them D's on that bitch (finished)
I was hot when they got rich off white tee's in this bitch
Survived a era when I was holla'in bout what about me in this bitch
They had songs, I had albums
They had hits, I had classics
They had a song that put 'em on
I made a lifestyle ratchet
They fell off, but I lasted
They got money, got happy
One time my coke bag was bigger than tha bag from me rappin'
Ima real nigga, ya'll talent
You ain't real, you unbalanced
So that hit can't come again
'Cause you ain't livin' yo value
Ima legend
You say I ain't, you hatin'
Is yo favorite rapper in '04 still yo favorite rapper now
Huh, Huh

[HOOK]
I remain a menace
Teflon from my hat to my tennis
They said I'd fall off but
I'm never finished
Yo favorite rapper finished til the end of song
