[Intro]
Boosie Badazz
Take the Badazz the hard way

[Chorus]
Have you read those papers? (goddamn)
America's most wanted
Couldn't get me when they got me
Now they say I'm with the 'luminati
America's most wanted
Have you read those papers? (who am I?)
America's most wanted
Six bodies, two attempts
Sir you're lying, I don't do attempts
America's most wanted

[Verse 1]
Snipers on the roof at my trial
Prosecutor tellin' the jury he need to die
Attempts but if you talkin' attempts then you a liar
On top of that Warner Brothers told me bye
Tried to give niggas deals, man they really tried to burn me
Said I had a bag of money on the district attonery
They tried to sink me, even send me up in jail dog, no charge
Now they talkin' court cases, these are real go hards
They told my fall partner ass so he can hurt me
Offered him ten and he was on seven murders
Snatched up my kin, labeled my mama as a witness
Ten years for marijuana and I ain't never been convicted, dirty bitches

[Chorus]
Have you read those papers? (goddamn)
America's most wanted
Couldn't get me when they got me
Now they say I'm with the 'luminati
America's most wanted
Have you read those papers? (who am I?)
America's most wanted
Six bodies, two attempts
Sir you're lying, I don't do attempts
America's most wanted

[Verse 2]
Came home, they say I couldn't drink beer, this shit is real
Judge read the verdict, the prosecutor in tears
Beat a motherfuckin' life, I say I ain't have fear
Send me straight to death row and I just had a couple years
I got blamed for niggas' bodies I ain't even fuckin' know
In my cell, tears fallin' on the floor, I wanna go
Feds comin' to my cell, frequent visits to the pen
Bitches sayin' if I win they gon' lock me up again
Had me in bulletproof trucks when they take me to court
Electric shocker on my body like where the fuck I'ma go?
Every song I talked about guns on, they brought it up
Had God on my side, this wasn't luck, what the fuck

[Chorus]
Have you read those papers? (goddamn)
America's most wanted
Couldn't get me when they got me
Now they say I'm with the Illuminati
America's most wanted
Have you read those papers? (who am I?)
America's most wanted
Six bodies, two attempts
Sir you're lying, I don't do attempts
America's most wanted

[Outro]
A deputy woke me up and he told me I'll be glad when they electrocute your black ass
America's most wanted
My jury was anonymous, they stayed in hotels, they couldn't say they name, couldn't do nothin'
America's most wanted
Homicide told me, we should've killed your ass when we had the chance
America's most wanted
One day they made my kids visit me in front of my cell, dirty ass cell
America's most wanted
They told me I want your fall partner to rat 'cause I know he gon' get killed, crazy
America's most wanted
Had all my niggas on the chalkboard, had me on the top, boss man
America's most wanted
