[Verse 1]
Here's a story 'bout a bad bitch, dark and lovely, real thick
Shorty stands up out, 5 - 6
Yeah, I met her at the corner store, gave her my name,  she was feelin' my game and she gave me her info
From that moment, yeah, we hit it off, never knowin' that this chick would cost me bruh
For being a creeper, dickin' down his diva
Man, I was thinkin' freak her, but I should've been thinkin' leave her
'cause if my homie only knew the deal, I know for sho' that he would wanna kill me, bruh
For being a creeper, dickin' down his diva
Man, I was thinkin' freak her, but I should've been thinkin' leave her

[Hook]
How could this be wrong, when it feel so right?, (right)
And if I'm wrong it won't be the first time in my life
I asked myself, I said, how could this be wrong, when it feel so right?
And if I'm wrong it won't be the first time in my life

[Verse 2]
I think I'm 'posed to say I let her go but the pussy soakin' wet and I keep goin' back for mo'
My nigga he trippin', he weak, I need to tell my son, dawg
That this bitch like the next bitch, for the big dogs  she a jump-off
He might not know what I'm sayin', he might feel some way 'bout his man
He might turn on me and hate me
Is these just excuses I'm makin'?
I'm fuckin' his bitch, droppin' her off to go fuck with my dawg
Pick him back up and go drop my boy off
Take that lil pussy right back to the house
We go from the bed, the shower the wall
She suckin' my dick while he ringin' her phone
This can't go on, this shit is wrong
We be in the same room, sittin' on the  same couch
We probably could make it if nobody talked

[Hook]
I asked myself, I said, how could this be wrong, when it feel so right?
And if I'm wrong it won't be the first time in my life
I asked myself, I said, how could this be wrong, when it feel so right?
(I know a lot of people done been thru this)
And if I'm wrong it won't be the first time in my life
