This song for all the ladies who make good love out there tonight
I want you to catch the dance floor with me
If you know how to satisfy your lover

This your song right here
Haha, 'cause you a soul snatcher, baby
(What’s your name? What's your name, girl?)
What's your name, girl?
(What’s your name? What's your name?)

[Chorus]
She's a soul snatcher (Soul snatcher)
Girl, who taught you how to do that? (Ooh girl, you fire)
Oh, she's a soul snatcher (Oh girl, you got it, got it)
Always say we done but go back

[Verse]
She's a soul snatcher (She give me head like yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, my toes after (She got the yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
You going back, to that
That smoke, that wet
That wet wet
Girl you know what time it is and I want you right now so
Say yes (Say yes)

And when it comes to sex I must say you're the best

[Chorus]
She's a soul snatcher (Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm)
Girl, who taught you how to do that? (Ooh girl, you fire)
