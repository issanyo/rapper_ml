[Intro]
Say thug I’m tired as a mofucka
I’m finna say my prayers and lay I down

[Hook]
Before I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take

[Verse 1]
Dear God keep evil away from me
Watch people who hate on me
Those who out to harm me
Give me signs and at least warn me God
Make my trips safe when I leave make me return
Any friendship that I have think of greed
Then let it burn
Keep the light in the road
[?] duck the darkness
I sleep with women who evil women
Let me just fuck em and be heartless
Be my rock God
Keep me humble no matter how big I grow
Keep me not satisfied so I want more
Let my hustle grow
When they shoot at me, let their eyes like Stevie Wonder
When my big break come
Let em see my hunger and feel my struggle
Don’t let my past be my future
Don’t let my family turn against me
When I pray I need your undivided attention

[Hook]
Before I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take
Before I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take

[Verse 2]
You and I know that I got sins
But all wrong ain’t wrong
If anybody understands is you so call me home
Wanna live long but that’s up to you
I know you got more shit for me to do
I know you got more kids for me to preach it to
I went to church and see em leech off you
Pitiful the same things that a nigga do
I’ve seen the preacher shit on you
For love and monetary gain like a killer do
That catholic ain’t know that was a faggot
Who he whispering to
So before I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
And if he with the illuminati
Don’t let him stay by me
This nigga try to shake my hand
Keep my hand private
I know I’m here for a reason, know why
They would have been got

[Hook]
Before I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take
Before I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take

[Outro]
Our father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
God I really feel I belong in heaven
They say ask and you’ll receive
Send me to heaven God
Forgive my sins and I’ll forgive those who trespass against me
