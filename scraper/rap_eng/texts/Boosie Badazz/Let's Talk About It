[Chorus]
Aw shit, let's talk about it
All we see is raindrops (All we see is crazy, woo)
Let's talk about it (Let me tell you what's goin' on)
Talk to 'em Boosie, let's go

[Verse 1]
They shootin' at the bus stop (Talk to 'em)
Fillin' up the graveyard (Oh, talk to 'em)
Lyin' at the church house (Oh, I'm 'bout to hurt they feelings now)
Takin' all our money from us (I'm 'bout to tell it like it is)
These lil' girls think they women now (Shit your lil' high ass down)
'Cause they got some ass and titties now (They got some ass and titties now)
If you make it, they gon' talk 'bout you (You make it, they gon' talk 'bout you)
Kanye West, what's wrong with you? (Seem like everybody trippin', man, straight up)

[Chorus]
Let's talk about it (What's goin' on?)
All we see is raindrops (All we see is raindrops)
Let's talk about it (It's crazy)
All we see is raindrops (It's a crazy world out there, tellin' y'all what's goin on)

[Verse 2]
They shootin' up the whole school (They shootin' up the whole damn school)
Safer to be homeschooled (I'm tellin' the truth now, I'm finna talk to 'em)
Taxes, man, they sky high, sky high
But we get bag of dog food, what's goin' on?
The feds got Mr. Dogfood (Free Ralo)
Bill Cosby, he on all news (Not the Jello Man)
Education low at all schools (Education low at all schools)
Plus they just sprayed me in the mall, fool (They just sprayed me in the mall, racist shit)

[Chorus]
Let's talk about it (It's 1968 all over again)
All we see is raindrops (All we see is crazy stuff every day)
Let's talk about it (Every day somethin' on the news crazy)
All we see is raindrops (Man, they gotta knew that's gon' happen)
What's goin' on? Damn
