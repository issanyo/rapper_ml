[Intro: Lil Boosie]
Lil Boosie Bad Azz
A lot of these niggas ain't ready to be no gangsta
So my word of advice to y'all niggas, chill out

[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
Nobody hate me cause they love me
They know I'm thuggin' I ain't backin' down from nothin' I ain't stuntin (patna)
I'm from a real street with real heat called G street
Cross the track we 50 deep how them thugs creep
Bein' niggas from fat, skinny, ta thin niggas chill out for you be up in that jail house
Mama's ain't bring us up to be no gangstas, The hood got us all with anger hood got us all in danger
Niggas throwed on every corner bottle after bottle, another kidney gettin' weak, from every swallow
Thought he was gone kill one when he bust that choppa
He let it off and killed wohty, and all his patnas
Now he locked up in a 6 man cell (Gettin fucked)
When he touch down he a straight up gal
Wanna be a husle ain't even got no street sense
You don't deserve it anyway
Ain't from that dirty anyway

[Hook: Lil Boosie x2]
It's too late to be the dope man (chill out)
Hoes love you till you broke man (chill out)
Watch ya friends real close man (chill out)
They give you life up in court Lil nigga chill out

[Verse 2: Lil Boosie]
You wanna life sentence? (think about it)
You wanna get put on lockdown were you can't write niggas?
You wanna get threw on that wrong line to fight niggas?
If you wanna be a rapper you gotta be dedicated (see mee)
Nigga couldn't tell Boosie shit that's how Lil Boosie made it Nigguhhh chill out, take that grill out yo mouth
Go and sell it fo 300 go get a half a oz (haaha)
Money talk, bullshit walk a thousand milles
Ho's go say they love a nigga but they love the shinee
So many niggas want my shine so I keep a 9
If I'm stressin I need purple 2 ease my mind
You don't know 'bout taken losses you don't know 'bout throwin' crosses
You got yo gold in yo mouth and got yo pistol now
Ain't nobody done ya nothin' but, you a killa now

[Hook: x2]

[Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
You ain't tired nigga? You can't see that yo momma eyes ain't dried yet? (look at 'em)
You get caught on that ride you gone be quiet (G code!)
You got that pistol you ready for that fire play where ya mind at?
You got screws in ya head you ain't retarded in a retarded way
But I guess you thuggin so you better be 'bout that pistol play donkey chill out
Eva since he been out laughin' lookin' happy his Lil cause takin' ova the south but all the boys already thuggin

I'm mister 106, can't fuck with no b! tch tryna chill my ass out
Lil Boosie on that other shit shoulda told glen 2 chill out and slow his roll
But I told him to go get laptops and 44â€²s forgive me God
My heart was cold real gangstas don't see 25 what I was told

[Hook: x2]
