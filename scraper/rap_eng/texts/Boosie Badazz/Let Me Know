[Chorus]
Let me know let me know
Just let me know let me know
What guys tryna sensual
I wanna try and send you
If you gotta feeling
Let me know let me know
Just let me know let me know

[Verse 1]
I've been hurt once before
Cried like a baby when I walked through the door
Checking on my girl nigga making on my girl
What then happen to my girl mama right she a hoe
Mama know mama know
That's what happens when a girl want more her lies to love a nigga
Snake niggas can't trust a nigga
Send my prayers wake up every morning
Middle fingers in the air motherfucker
Let me know what is gonna be on beat
Either we fucking or we friends or we're down with speech
Let me know let me know
What it's gonna be
You got my back in a lack if I'm on my knees
If I lost everything would you hustle with me
Lie understand if they bust a nigga
Stay down for a thug really thug a nigga
If I'm fucking with 'em zanes as you fucking with 'em
Is it real or are we fucking let me know
Is it real or we fucking is it real or we fucking
If you with it then I'm with it let me know
All I need is a thumbs up
Let me know something

[Chorus]
Let me know let me know
Just let me know let me know
What guys tryna sensual
I wanna try and send you
If you gotta feeling
Let me know let me know
Just let me know let me know

[Verse 2]
Baby, I won't go just give me a phone call
Legs to the ceiling giving you the feeling you never felt in your lifetime
I know we feeling love I don't care shit I know when was the right time
Your ass was running with niggas but you put up with 'em
You were in your right mind
You just waiting till I get my life together
I'ma put some diamonds all up in your bed so she don't wanna leave
We goin' do it better I want you dressed in more de-tas
I want you dressed and just leather baby
Yeah we goin' make the most jealous baby
I look at you and I see the precious
Leg on your body lets get it cracking leg on your body lets get it cracking
Yeah yeah yeah yeah leg on your body lets get it cracking

[Chorus]
Let me know let me know
Just let me know let me know
If you gotta feeling you love me
I wanna try and send you
If you gotta feeling
Let me know let me know
Just let me know let me know
