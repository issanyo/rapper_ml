[Lil' Boosie]
Pussy ass niggas
Take this song how you want
Take this song how you want

Ol' pussy ass niggas
Faggot ass niggas, ratting ass niggas
Take this song how you want
Take this song how you want

Niggas still wanna see me dead
Cause I'd done made a lil' deal
Still hating for real so I stay with my steel
You play with this here nigga
You gon' learn something

Piss over his body while he dead
Then I'm gon' burn something
Now you can find me nine deep
'Cross the track in my all black Monte Carlos

What you know 'bout that?
'Bout them boys, chop them boys
If you can't shine like us nigga
You better watch us, boy

You pussy niggas know one thing
I'm 'bout my meal
And it still the same shit
Check gula, check treal

And I been told ya niggas follow me
I have the ticket
And I been told ya niggas
One day I'm gon' be the sickest

And I hate a pussy nigga
I take a pussy
I'm asking god please
Why you make a pussy nigga?

Pussy nigga, I'm gon' show you
How it suppose to go, thug
Brang that drama show
That, nigga, ain't no hoe in my blood

Ol' pussy ass niggas
Faggot ass niggas, ratting ass niggas
Take this song how you want
Take this song how you want
Take this song how you want
