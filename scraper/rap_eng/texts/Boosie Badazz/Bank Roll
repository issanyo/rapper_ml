[Verse 1]

Fresh starch yo clothes had all da fine hoes
Every time he took a picture he pulled out his bankroll
I watched and observed niggas taught me how tah serve (word)
Turnt 16 I was gettin a quarter bird, big knots in my dickie pants
Had a plug on dat weed and had a plug on dat cain, I'm off da chain mayne!
Trell came home I was on, everythang dat nigga throwed me it was gone
Lil ivy taught me bankrolls fuck a bitch (m.o.b) I got dis caine mayne
And I got dis weed and syrup shit well lets get rich I got too many knots I couldn't put it in a box (DAMN!)
