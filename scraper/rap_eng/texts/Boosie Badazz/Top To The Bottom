It was all a dream I used to write raps in my notebook
A baby G tryin' to walk like Eazy-E
2pac was the shit to me
In my front room tryin to sing Jodeci
My cousin Trell thought he was Ice-T
Minutes came out I thought I was k and b
And the realist nigga came to me
Lost daddy and it really made a man of me
Dropped school when I dropped out cause my momma need help
Fuck that so I'm out teenager with a baby
Then I had 2
Stayin with my grams at 1132
Walked in the streets were most niggas don't make it
In and outta jail man niggas can't shake it
So many people did me wrong
That's why I had to write this song

( chorus )
They said I'd never make it to the top
Cause I come from the bottom
I'm from the hood were they make it baby
They said I never make it to the top
Cause I come from the bottom
I'm on fire and I'm paper chasin'

One shot for the Hot Boys
Them niggas make me wanna get a nine boy
Never thought I have cars like I got cars
Never thought I have broads like I got broads
Same girls wouldn't holler at a broke nigga
On my dick like flies on shit so I treat her like a ho nigga
Lost some niggas in the struggle
The night I lost I, I lost my brother
Gotta get paid what I told my mother
Show off your Rolex because your son is a young hustler
Everybody mad while we laying  across the street
Say we got rich off sellin' that D
Say the hood good if it good when ya get big money
Now the hood wanna do ya in
They say I be in the pen but that's a lie
Fuck my name up time after time Boosie badazz

( chorus )

I'm from the hood were they don't make it
Everything they shoot ain't got no safe
Everything hood ain't got no patience
So, they do time for a stupid ass crime
Turf taught me  grind nigga shine late
Years past by and I got that paper
Said I wouldn't make it they laughed at a nigga
Now I'm on t.v. a ol' badass nigga
Came from the trap across the tracks where its thugs
Now I got a house 3 stories like a club
People still talkin' bout me but its all gravy
So many people love me somebody gotta hate me
I went from runnin' from the jump out boys to being followed round  town by the binocular boys
Remember when I used to sit in front the game room
Calvin Ricks was the shit on my avenue

( chorus )
