We ain't with all that

[Chorus]
Sometimes I be out of my mind
But I know how to have a good time
Everybody want me round
'Cause I know how to have a good time
Sometimes I be out of my body
But I know how to have a good time
My teacher, she done drunk her wine
But she know how to have a good time

Sometimes I be out of my mind
But I know how to have a good time
Everybody want me round
'Cause I know how to have a good time
No, we ain't bother nobody (We ain't with all that)

[Outro]
If you lookin' for some trouble, boy, beat it (Boy, beat it)
I'm just tryna have some fun with my people (That's it)
Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
(Get your messy ass down, sit your ass down, broke ass bitch)
If you lookin' for some trouble, boy, beat it (Boy, beat it)
I'm just tryna have some fun with my people
Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
(Go put some clothes on, you look bad, beat it)
(You need to, you need to, you need, you need to go take a bath)
