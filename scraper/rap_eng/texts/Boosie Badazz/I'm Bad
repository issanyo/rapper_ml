[Intro]
Boosie
Mom I'm sorry for being a bad boy

[Verse 1]
No rappers spittin' lyrics like I can
I take a pussy ass nigga and put his face in the sand
All the sexy ladies love me, man I'm fresh as can be
Bad boy reputation, I keep hitters with me
Head strictly for the top and I'm gettin' them figures
Might not stop for the cops 'cause they killin' us niggas
Got the whole world jumpin', people know all my raps
Bad bitches screamin' my name, niggas givin' me dap
Out of jail, back on the map, almost a hundred a show
I'm like Starbucks coffee nigga, I'm everywhere that you go
I don't care 'bout your favorite rapper, I'm the realest to blow
Steppin' on the fuckin' game like I stepped on that coke

[Chorus]
And I'm bad (bad, bad, bad)
Bad boy (bad, bad, bad), Boosie
And I'm bad (bad, bad, bad)
Bad boy (b-b-bad, b-b-b, b-b, b-b-b)

[Verse 2]
I'm like Floyd, I'm so undefeated
Music is my way of life, I need it, I breathe it
Turn up the mic and hear the sounds of a gangster
Five years inside a hole really fucked up my thinkin'
Diamonds shinin', neck is blindin', F-E-D's on my trail
Niggas gettin' my album tatted, Touchdown 2 Cause Hell
Ridin' 'round in that Rolls Royce with the stars in the roof
System labelled me a killer and the magazine too
So what they do? spread they lies then they stick in a needle
Make me out an animal, and you people believe it
Guess I'm a bad bad boy, motherfuckin' bad boy
Gold teeth, gold jewelry nigga, bad boy
Bass stompin' through the speakers and I'm killin' the beat
I ain't met a nigga yet spit this shit like me
They call me Boosie Badazz, to the police, we don't talk nigga
Fuck every clothing line, wear Jewel House nigga

[Chorus]
And I'm bad (bad, bad, bad)
Bad boy (bad, bad, bad), Boosie
And I'm bad (bad, bad, bad)
Bad boy (b-b-bad, b-b-b, b-b, b-b-b)

[Verse 3]
It's like I rose from the dead 'cause they counted me out
Ever since I been released I been the talk of the talk
My daughter told you I was comin', she went viral for that
Told y'all that the streets was mine, she wasn't lyin' 'bout that
Now everything I touch is gold, I'm the best at this rap
We live like the Italians, we got morals and values
I break a muscle pound man all the way to his feet
Cut that nigga in his head and put his face in the sink
I come to lay it down and conquer, it won't be long
Samsung, man y'all need a Boosie Badazz phone
I got bitches by the dozens, all kind of complexions
In my Jacuzzi poppin' bottles, and all of us naked

[Chorus]
And I'm bad (bad, bad, bad)
Bad boy (bad, bad, bad), Boosie
And I'm bad (bad, bad, bad)
Bad boy (b-b-bad, b-b-b, b-b, b-b-b)
