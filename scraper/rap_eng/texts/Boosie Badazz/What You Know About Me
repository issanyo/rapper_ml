[INTRO : BOOSIE TALKING]

Nigga fuck what you heard 'bout me
Nigga fuck what they say 'bout me nigga
I don't give a fuck nigga
I be thuggin' nigga
Straight up, fuck a nigga straight up

Nigga you drunk

[BRIDGE]
I keep them rugers poppin'
I had Coogi poppin'
I went to jail
What happened?
Now that Coogi floppin' (It's over)
They blame me for some bodies
I think they curious
We never beefed
Don't know what happened to him
Period (Fuck that shit)
I'm not a lyricist (Nah)
I'm a story teller
Done smoked a lot of trees
But I cook coke better
Ima trendsetter
Had tha world ridin' Chargers
Had tha thugs clutchin' 40's
Made some scary niggas heart less

[VERSE 1]
You probably heard a lot of niggas tryna wet me up
You probably heard I'm pussy (Guess what)
They tryna set you up (Don't be no dummy)
You probably tried to take my swag
And run wit' it
But he ain't cut ya hair right
So you can't run wit' it (Ha Ha Ha)
They say I died like 20 times
But I'm still here
Question me for 20 crimes
But I never squealed
They say my past fucked up
I say you dissin' nigga
These niggas say I'm fuckin' all tha strippers
I say you messy nigga

[HOOK]
What you know about me
What you heard about me
Is you sho' about me
Ain't no hoe about me

What you know about me
What you know about me
What you heard about me
Is you sho' about me
Ain't no hoe about me

[VERSE 2]
You probably read tha paper
You probably seen tha news
You probably guess yo answer (Guilty)
After you seen my goons
I light up tha room
Tha center of attention nigga
Ridin' 'round gettin' it nigga
Please don't get me twisted nigga
Tell me tha truth
What you heard about my history nigga
Heard 'bout what I did to niggas
Stop it
I'm not guilty nigga
Don't believe ya ears (4real)
Don't underestimate tha kid
Was a gangsta on tha street
Was a gangsta in tha pen
They say I love them strippers
Cause I fuck them strippers
Thug swag
That's what get 'em
I let you bustas tip 'em
Tha paper call me Gotti
But not tha one from Memphis
They call me John Gotti
But they wouldn't show about it
You heard my shows be wildin'
People be straight yellin'
"I ain't goin' to Boosie shows, cuz they gon' start shootin'"
I never ran from a fight
Always been tha leader
Been a Bad Azz
Better ask my fuckin' teachers
They gon' tell ya

[HOOK]
What you know about me
What you heard about me
Is you sho' about me
Ain't no hoe about me

What you know about me
What you know about me
What you heard about me
Is you sho' about me
Ain't no hoe about me
