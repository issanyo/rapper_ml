[Intro]
As you know, I'm a playboy
I do what I want when I want
But I'm always there for that special lady who need someone to talk to

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm the clean up man (Yes I am, baby)
I'm the clean up man (I make you feel good)
I do what I want (Do what I want)
And I ain't tied down to no string
Baby, I'm the clean up man (Yes I am, baby)
I'm the clean up man (I listen, baby)
I do what I want, I screw who I want
And I ain't tied down to no string

[Verse 1]
Baby, I'm the clean up man (Boosie Badazz)
You can call me any time, I'll be right on time
To clean up things (I got you, baby)
You can cry on my shoulder like a baby (Like a baby)
I'ma wipe your tears, girl, like your lady (Like my baby)
You're goin' bad, I got some money for you, baby (I got you)
Get your hair fixed for you and your nails done (You lookin' nice)
Every time you say thanks, I say you're welcome (Welcome)

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm the clean up man (Yes I am, honey)
I'm the clean up man (I make you feel good)
I do what I want (Do what I want)
And I ain't tied down to no string
Baby, I'm the clean up man (Yes I am, baby)
I'm the clean up man (Yes I am, baby)
I do what I want, I screw who I want
And I ain't tied down to no string

[Verse 2]
Why you cryin' and shit? (He just keep cheatin' on me)
What he did you, baby? (He don't do nothin' for these kids)
I got you, baby (I just need to get away)
I'll take you honey
Take you back to the spot with me
Make the bed come and rock with me (Uh, uh)
Your man don't need to know nothin' 'bout me
And when you're goin' through it baby, make sure you call me

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm the clean up man (Yes I am, baby)
I'm the clean up man (I got you)
I do what I want (Do what I want, yes sir)
And I ain't tied down to no string (I ain't on no string)
Baby, I'm the clean up man (Yes I am, baby)
I'm the clean up man (Yes I am)
I do what I want (Do what I want), I screw who I want
And I ain't tied down to no string (Hah)

[Outro]
Baby, I'm the clean up man
You make it messy, I clean it up for you, partner
If you ain't hittin' that pussy right, I put a fine tune on that pussy
I'm the clean up man
If you don't wanna listen to her
I'll give her a few minutes to tell me what's on her mind
