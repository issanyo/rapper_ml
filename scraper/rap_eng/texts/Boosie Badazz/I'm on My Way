[Verse 1]
On my way to Mississippi (I love Mississippi)
Where everybody love me like whiskey (Everybody love Boosie in Mississippi)
On my way to Alabama (On my way to Alabama)
Had to stop in Louisiana
To get the right hot sauce with my chicken (Woo, woo)
Tomorrow is Milwaukee (Tomorrow is Milwaukee)
Where the girls ain't talkin’ (Girls ain't talkin')
After that, Kentucky
Where all the fine white girls love me (Listen Jane, listen Jane)
On the way to cut the food (On the way to cut the food)
On the way to sing the blues
Got a brand new shirt, got some brand new shoes
Girl, I’m on my way to you (My way to you)

[Chorus]
On my way (On my way)
On my way (On my way)
On my way (Lord, girl)
On my way
Won't be long now ('Cause I'm on my way)
Won't be long now ('Cause I'm comin' right now)
Won’t be long now (’Cause I'm on my way)
’Cause I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
Jumped on the airplane (I looked out the window)
It never rains in Southern California
How it looks from the airplane (It looks from the airplane)
Told Sidney I'm on my way (Woo)
Told her no molly in them three (Woo)
Leave LA and hit the A (Woo)
I'm on my way to the Flame (Woo)
Dallas, Texas know my name (Woo)
They favorite thing was my flame (Woo)
Need to go and pay a visit (Woo)
But I can’t get out of Houston (Woo, woo)

[Chorus]
On my way (Promise you, girl)
On my way
On my way
On my way (On my way)
Won't be long now
Won't be long now
Won't be long now
'Cause I'm on my way

[Outro]
On my way to Mississippi
Love Mississippi
On my way to Mississippi
Everybody love me like whiskey
On my way to Alabama
Love Alabama
Had to stop in Louisiana
To get the right hot sauce with my chicken
Krispy Kreme, I'm on my way
Blue Store, I'm on my way
Man it's nice, on my way
Debbie Kruger, on my way
Won't be long now
Be long now
On my way
