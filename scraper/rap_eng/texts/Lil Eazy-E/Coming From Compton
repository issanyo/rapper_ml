I heard the streets been talking
He keeps saying my name, that nigga Game gon' be layin in a coffin
I'm the muthaphuckin prince of Compton
First and last
Don't make me the first to blast
You're the type I'll merk ya laugh
Cause youse a fony
Walk around like you was my homie
Knowin' Damn well you was neva close 2 E
Jayceon who da hell you suppose to be
On my block I got homies who can pose to squeeze
And have a motherfucker layin face down to the streetz
Certified G and I don't have to pay for that
No one but E brought y'all little fame in rap
I drop sixteen and I'm gettin paid for rap
(He don't write his own raps)
How lame is that
You sound just like a bitch when she start to bleed
You gonna have a nigga trippin once he spark this weed
The old E keep a nigga straight fuck that Vodka
Can't waste time dealin with these punk Imposter's
Had to holla at the DR so we know what's poppin
Lil E is the name and I'm coming from Compton

Real recognize real my nigga
Youse to be strippin in the club, cause you ain't no killa
Loc nigga to the death note the set I claim
In the hood homies action never said you bang
If I can change a motherfucker in the new york minute
You from compton, but keep puttin new york in it
I'm a west-coast nigga I get respect from both
The tatto on your arm is disrespectfull loc
Gotta smoke cause this nigga keep working my nerves
I'm a have that butterfly in his face on a curve
Get served try to hit me with a come-back verse
Already known in the streets I'm a come back worse
The truth hurts
And I hate to expose yo homie
Before The Game ya nickname it wuz dosia homie
He's a fony and a fake can't relate to E
Certified and I'm coming from the C.P.T
