[Verse 1]
I know my life ain't promised
Being honest, that's easy
Seventeen star movie geezy
Back and forth to Navarra from Greenley
Homies on lock down, now I'm on TV
New CD, everybody play me
Two years ago remember everybody hating
Now everybody waving like they know me
Fake ass niggas still wanna be my homies
Same old E, same old swagga
Gangsta for sho' but I ain't no rapper, actor
Take a look at cha face, claiming you're from Compton
But you're a disgrace (put this dude in his place)
Wait a minute, he the same dude that got my face up in it
That's a lie
Pops died and I'm here to resurrect him
Real old G's gon' respect it

[Hook]
Cause they know me, but they don't know you
Lil E certified G, i'm the truth
Take me out the booth and i'm back on the streets
Doing that work, saying fuck the police
Cause they know me,but they don't know you
Lil E certified G, i'm the truth
Take me out the booth and i'm back on the streets
Doing that work, saying fuck the police
Cause they know me

[Verse 2]
Still back to the PG
That's pro gram and this eazy
Young [?]
Blue flag on me, I'm gangsta
Fuck it
No justice and still no peace
It's real out here in these streets
And with these beats comes a new legacy
D-O-C gave me the whole recipe
How about work? Don't need skills
645 stay fully detailed, clean
Team full of villains and doctors and natural born killers
That squill on their partner
And pops was the first to start it
Now these niggas act like they're really the hardest
Hard targets and I'm gon' stop them
Release day, we'll see who top them

[Hook]
Cause they know me, but they don't know you
Lil E certified G, i'm the truth
Take me out the booth and i'm back on the streets
Doing that work, saying fuck the police
Cause they know me,but they don't know you
Lil E certified G, i'm the truth
Take me out the booth and i'm back on the streets
Doing that work, saying fuck the police
Cause they know me

Cause they know me.... x3
