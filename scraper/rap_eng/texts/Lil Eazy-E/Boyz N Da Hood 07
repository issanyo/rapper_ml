[Intro]
Shout out: Oakland, San Francisco, Vallejo, Richmond, East Palo Alto, the whole Bay Area! Yeee!

[Verse 1]
Now if it ain't a six-fo, then it's sixty-three
And I ain't in that motherfucker, 'less it sit on D's
Got dough beyond me, got Chris on "Freeze"
And if you see me in the club, it's a bitch on me
Fo'-five in the side, nine in that dash
Three-eight for the snakes playin' in that grass
See that Kate getting hate, but no matter what they say
Niggas see me in the streets, then I'm in that ass
Fuck what you heard, this here's the truth, E
I'll be the same G when I leave the booth
You gang bang on wax, but you're lame on tracks
If it came down to it I'd eat ya fool


[Pre-Hook]
I'm cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'
Knockin' the freaks, mackin' at hoes
Black Super Sport, everything original
Top down, too deep [?]

Boys in the hood!


[Hook]
We stackin' and bangin' colors
What's crackin' on one another
Still claimin' sets in the gutter
Boys in the hood!
We slangin' and sellin' bud off a brother
You get wet if you ain't under our own bruh
Boys in the hood!
We ganstas and nothin' other
Still duckin' them undercovers
We some bad motherfuckers
Boys in the hood!


[Post-Hook]
We get to poppin' shots
Now the one-time's comin' 'cause the block is hot

[Verse 2]
Look up in the sky, see E on top
In a wife B wit a white tee on top
New Spike Lee Nikes, we don't rock
No Vans 'round here, that'd get ya shot
I don't skateboard, but I got shit to flip
Yes, I'm on my grind, but nigga, not like them
I stay fly and I got 'em screamin' again -
"We want Eazy!"
Well bitch, I'm him
Throw my hood up high in the sky, fo' sho'
Rims sittin' real high, but the top is low
Want the hoes to see me, so I'm ridin' slow
Wit my arm on the do' so my watch can show, while I'm

[Verse 3]
Niggas know my C's in C the PT got it locked
Try me, get knocked on GD's
The boys in the hood, they knock my CD
'Cause I grew up in the hood, and not on TV
I keep my [?], ya roll with gangstas
Blue flag, new rag top on them Daytons
[?] jacked, coupe ass drop on them scrapers
It's just some tools that I keep to attract them haters
Get in a bitch head like activated
E a mack, he a whack-ass Captain Sava
I stack my paper, boy stack ya [?]
The Eazy, I'm Compton's actin' mayor
