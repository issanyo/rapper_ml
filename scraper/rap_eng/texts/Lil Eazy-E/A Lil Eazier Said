Ey *** I don't think they heard you, tell them what your name is
My name is Eazy yeah this is true, rolling up the west is what I gonna do
Same plan as my old man, same hood in the motherfucking ***
Same gangster, East South Compton the hustler
A Nigga real touching will lead ya, face down in the gutter
You don't like how I'm living well fuck you
It's Eazy, just call me E, Lil-E from the CPT and I'm the same person ***
In the hood ***
