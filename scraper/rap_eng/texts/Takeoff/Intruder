Where?
Intruder, intruder (ayy!)
Intruder, intruder (ayy!)
Intruder, intruder
Look at the top of my roof, I'ma shoot 'cause I see an
Intruder, intruder (who?)
Intruder, intruder (where?)
Intruder, intruder
If I didn't know you since day one, to me nigga you's an
Intruder, intruder (whoa)
Intruder, intruder (yeah)
Intruder, intruder
Better not open the door if you didn't know that's an
Intruder, intruder
Intruder, (bow!) intruder
Intruder, (bow!) intruder
You never know who's an intruder

[Verse]
Don't do it, intruder
I bust ya (bow!) medulla
I'm burned out, I'm throwed off
I'm cutthroat, you knew it (you knew that)
Had a sweet lick for a meal-tick (M&M)
Phew, you blew it (you blew that)
Ya'll niggas don't know nothin' 'bout the game
I can't help it y'all niggas new to it (new to that)
Intruders try run in my house (graaah!)
Hope you got insurance (hope!)
Notice I drink heavy codeine
But when I pick up the chopper, get endurance
Night time vision on the scope
Pickin' off-a the intruder, I'm watchin' the door
Put a strap into the intruder face
He don't know where to go
Started with a handful
Like Boston George on Blow (Boston!)
Intruder don't say I didn't try and tell 'em
'Fore I send them shots up at your cerebellum
It's a warnin' sign in my backyard said "Do not enter"
I got the right to kill em (pop, pop!)
Potato peeler how a nigga peel ya (woo!)
Cannabilism, my dawg eat him (ruff!)
No Halloween but I might trick-or-treat him
Or July fourth him and take his freedom (Takeoff!)
