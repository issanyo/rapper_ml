[Intro]
Revolutions..you follow?
Keep the clients on the Ferris wheel and it goes, the park is open 24/7, 365, every decade, every god damn century. That's it...name of the game

[Bridge: L-Dog]
And ya gang gon bounce to this shit
And ya main hoe bouncing on my dick
And a nigga got a blizzard on his wrist
And the way a nigga flexing got these pussy niggas sick

[Hook: Lordjay]
Pull up in an all white Lexus (skrrt)
Bitch thick as hell I think she came  from Texas (what?)
We just gon fuck don't even need the Netflix (damn,damn,damn,damn!)
I fucked your main  hoe crossed that bitch off my check list

[Verse 1: Sauce]
Pass the  blunt around the rotation
Main bitch Korean, side bitch Haitian
I take em everywhere I go besides vacation
Shawdy always in her feelings and a nigga a hate it
You make me wanna go, and get wasted
Chasing money everyday, but I'm not racin
All my cars black and no I'm not racist
Cuz all my fuckin bills have green faces

[Verse 2: Ty Sampson]
Brand new foreign, knock that shit right off my checklist
Fuckin on ya hoe i'm waiting on my next bitch
You know the Dj play my songs on his set-list
Got ya lil hoe twerkin' all reckless
You know my aim is dangerous, I'll leave you headless
Fucked the wind right out ya hoe, now that bitch breathless
I've been trappin all night, a nigga restless
Don't come out in these streets lil nigga it's too hectic

[Pre-Hook: Trejoo]
Just bought a Rollie with my check
Put diamonds all around my bitch neck
Shooting at you niggas for respect
If you see a nigga comin then you niggas betta step

[Hook: Lordjay]

[Verse 3: Trejoo]
Shawdy suck like the lions in 08'
Look that bitch in her eye, made her pay for my date
I'm a nigga from chiraq, catch a king check mate
Got so many brothers that end up in jail call them inmates
I'm a new type of nigga, iPhone Update
If I cheated on a bitch all her friends would spy gate
Shout-out Arundel High, most of y'all niggas fake
But y'all niggas won't see me, grew up fighting light-weight

[Verse 3: Lordjay]
I told lil mama I got a nigga been had it since  back in 05
I'm whippin that rari and Bentley but that all white Lexus IS all that I drive 
I'm smoking till brain cells are dead
But a nigga never felt more alive
I told lil bitch that I love her im sorry i lied PUSH that pride to the side 
Cuz we don't have time for yo bullshit
We don't have time for your games (time for ya!)
Nobody bumping ya new shit
Everyone know that you lame (know that ya!)
And we maybe be the same age
But no we not one in the same
I got 8 different hoes don't remember they names
Kick them all out of like lu Kang
Gang, gang

[Outro: lordjay]
Pussy niggas sick...

Cuz the way a nigga flexin' got these pusst niggas sick
