[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Jumped out that Audi, big ring, no marriage
Hood, but my style from Paris
Twenty thousand, excuse me, I'm sagging
That's your hoe? Damn, you should be embarrased
She fuck good, gymnastics
Ooh, she suck it good, she nasty
I sent her home in a Uber
Then I jumped right in the Aston
Smoking that gas, mashing the gas
Chopper shotgun, I'm ready to blast
I do what I want, I want the cash
Pablo, I made the store run out of rubberbands
Pull up, iced out, gun in my hand
I got too much sauce, they can't understand
Scarf wrapped around my head like the Taliban
Ooh, look how them diamonds dance
In my new condo, it sits on an island
Brand new V12s, zero mileage
I swear I got bitches that look just like Kylie
Rolex Daytona with colorful diamonds
Got girls going to the mansion, they wilding
Only thing they allowed to wear is towels
Came from the hood, look at me now
Rich nigga, I might jump in the crowd
We don't follow rules

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I do what I wanna do
Tokyo Asian yellow bitch, Pikachu
Ghost, peek-a-boo, go buy the Lamb, too
Two bitches, I do what I wanna do
Too much money, I might not speak to you
Walk through the mall, buy whatever I want to
Chopstick, Benihana mushroom soup
Bought a new Coupe, cut the roof 'cause I want to
When you got money, you do what you wanna do
Hoodrich, bitch, I do what I wanna do
Fucked in her mouth, I hope she not kissing you
Bend her over, fuck her right in the Coupe
I could make her whatever I want her to
I got the juice, so I do what I wanna do
Ooh, spent a hundred thousand on jewels
I do whatever I wanna do

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
(Takeoff!)
Spend a hundred with the jeweler
Get some knowledge from a tutor
Don't go to ranges on the daily
But Takeoff still a sharpshooter
Young rich nigga, I influence
The culture, the music, the shit that they doing (I did)
Run off with the sac for my nigga behind the wall
Posted up behind the lot, can't do it
Shoot out, shoot out, hit them with the Uzi
She take it and put the dope in her coochie
Selling the dope and it's raw sushi
Hop out the drop top, two-piece
Quick start the whip, need no key
Fuck around, they gon' turn me to the old me
Nigga that copy the flow, owe me
How you drinking up lean with no codeine

[Verse 3: Offset]
I do whatever I want
Dropped a big bag on some points
I cook a brick, like it well done
I cook the beef, like it well done
Roll up my sleeve and it's snowing
How you the plug and you owe him?
Smoking on cook by the farm
Everything we do is abnormal
100K when we performing
Bitch, ain't no game, we been going in
We all in your face, kinda annoying
They be like, "Damn, there they go again"
I tell your bitch to invite a friend
Pull up in Lambo with Nitrogen
I'm pulling strings, it's a violin
I'm sipping lean, I'm high again
Do what I do, make her blow like a flute
How 'bout I knock at your door with the coolie
I turned the microphone dive in the Coupe
I got the bag to provide for the crew
My gang undefeated we make it look easy
Look at your bitch, yeah, she eat it
Hit it one time, then I'm leaving (smash)
I'ma just leave it to Beaver

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I do what I wanna do
Tokyo Asian yellow bitch, Pikachu
Ghost, peek-a-boo, go buy the Lamb, too
Two bitches, I do what I wanna do
Too much money, I might not speak to you
Walk through the mall, buy whatever I want to
Chopstick, Benihana mushroom soup
Bought a new Coupe, cut the roof 'cause I want to
When you got money, you do what you wanna do
Hoodrich, bitch, I do what I wanna do
Fucked in her mouth, I hope she not kissing you
Bend her over, fuck her right in the Coupe
I could make her whatever I want her to
I got the juice, so I do what I wanna do
Ooh, spent a hundred thousand on jewels
I do whatever I wanna do

[Verse 4: Quavo]
I pull up flexing the timepiece
I beat up the pot [Harambe]
I'ma keep it one thousand, yeah
Nothing but real niggas 'round me
I'ma buy a hundred thousand rounds
Just in case a nigga want beef
Do what I want with that Lambo
'Cause I did what I want with that 10-speed
High speed
Green light, can't stop me
Came from the bottom
I've been through the war, tried to pop me
Walk in the store and I get what I want 'cause I got me
Niggas from the north, we hotter than a bag of Takis
I'm in the streets and I'm taking risks like I'm Evel Knievel
Play with the keys, play with the keys 'cause I really need them
Back in the day, I was having the P's, they tried to seize them
Paid my dues, I done paid my fees, we finally equal

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I do what I wanna do
Tokyo Asian yellow bitch, Pikachu
Ghost, peek-a-boo, go buy the Lamb, too
Two bitches, I do what I wanna do
Too much money, I might not speak to you
Walk through the mall, buy whatever I want to
Chopstick, Benihana mushroom soup
Bought a new Coupe, cut the roof 'cause I want to
When you got money, you do what you wanna do
Hoodrich, bitch, I do what I wanna do
Fucked in her mouth, I hope she not kissing you
Bend her over, fuck her right in the Coupe
I could make her whatever I want her to
I got the juice, so I do what I wanna do
Ooh, spent a hundred thousand on jewels
I do whatever I wanna do
