[Hook: Marty Baller]
I got kitty on my breath and some cheese steak
Girl I really want the head she said please wait
I'm a doberman pinscher for the bitches
If she even breathe wrong I'mma ditch her
Baby I'm a dog, baby I'm a dog
If I could fuck em all I'ma fuck em all
Baby I'm a dog, baby I'm a dog
If I could fuck em all I'ma fuck em all

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Marty Baller show these motherfuckers how to ball
I'ma ball hard like Chris Paul
Swervin' in the street in a new Porsche
My nigga blow that loud, blow the windows off
I got diamonds in my grill don't need no dental floss
And I got three hoes like I'm Santa Clause
And they all divas like Diana Ross
And I just be going 'woo', cause I'm a dog

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
I got kitty on my breath and some cheese steak
Babe, I really want the head she said please wait

Baby I'm a dog, baby I'm a dog
If I could fuck em all I'ma fuck em all
Baby I'm a dog, baby I'm a dog
If I could fuck em all I'ma fuck em all

[Verse 2: Marty Baller]

Jean Paul Gaultier I got my frames on
And I had to throw my Alexander Wang on

[Hook: Marty Baller]
I got kitty on my breath and some cheese steak

If I could fuck em all I'ma fuck em all
Baby I'm a dog, baby I'm a dog
If I could fuck em all I'ma fuck em all

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Really I'm a dog really I'm a dog

Ice on my neck I'm sick I got menopause
Took yo hoe in a dress cause she wear no draws
She want me take her to the mall, I'm a dog cause I tell her na
Lil bitty bitch need a pause
Lil mama she lost in the sauce
Flaws and all she make the birds sing like Diana Ross

Lil bitty bitch she better not cough
If she ever get caught I'm takin' right off cause she gonna talk

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
I got codeine on my breath just ate T-bone steak (actavis)
And I'm all about my chips nigga Frito lays (stackin' it)
