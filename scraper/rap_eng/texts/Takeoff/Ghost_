Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse: Lil Yachty]
[?] dick in her ribs
I came from nothing
Now I ghost ride the coupe
Where is the money? Please point me that way

[Verse: Takeoff]
Bad bitch, small waist, pretty face
Havin' my way, she let me nut on her face
Stay in your place, shut up and get out the way
[?]

[Chorus: Takeoff]
Imma go slide the Wraith (ghost)
Imma go ride the Wraith (ghost)
[?] look at the stars today
Imma just ride the Wraith (ghost)
