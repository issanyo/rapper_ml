[Intro: Takeoff]
Streets On Lock 2 man y'all know we been had the streets on lock
QC in the building man
Takeoff

[Chorus: Quavo]
I told my momma I'ma see a hunnid bands
I told my momma I'ma get her in that Lamb
I told me momma she ain't gon' never need a man
As long as her son playin' with them bands
My momma my momma my momma my momma
My momma my momma my momma my momma
I told my momma I'ma see a hunnid bands
I told me momma she ain't gon' never need a man

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I love my momma Johnny Bravo
She inspired me to make nachos
Like a boss I'm at the show [?]
Bought the snake yea she gave me the antidote
Seventeen I was kickin' doors with my right hand man Domingo
Know Trinidad we was takin' goals and the flat cash out on a pawn store
The difference between me and you
I'ma go getter nigga who are you
I'm a real ass nigga you fool (you fake)
You a pussy ass nigga [?]
My momma she told me about it
The game so cold like hockey
You the same nigga jumpin' on my Nikes
Now I'm rich now you wanna be like me

[Chorus: Quavo]
I told my momma I'ma see a hunnid bands
I told my momma I'ma get her in that Lamb
I told me momma she ain't gon' never need a man
As long as her son playin' with them bands
My momma my momma my momma my momma
My momma my momma my momma my momma
I told my momma I'ma see a hunnid bands
I told me momma she ain't gon' never need a man

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Remember the Audis Bugattis Ferraris I got you all three in the mansion
Pull up in a Bentley it's missin' the ceiling
My wrist is expensive your bitches is kissin'
Momma raised a boss nigga
You a fake nigga you a pretender
You the type of nigga changin' gender
Playin' with the [?] it's [?]
Momma always told me if a nigga hit you hit back but I'ma bust nigga
Bought a brand new Rolls Royce
If you don't wanna drive I got a chauffeur
Told me 'bout these cobras
Safe to say it's on my brothas
So a lot of these niggas can't trust ya
And the only girl I love is my momma

[Chorus: Quavo]
I told my momma I'ma see a hunnid bands
I told my momma I'ma get her in that Lamb
I told me momma she ain't gon' never need a man
As long as her son playin' with them bands
My momma my momma my momma my momma
My momma my momma my momma my momma
I told my momma I'ma see a hunnid bands
I told me momma she ain't gon' never need a man

[Verse 3: Yakki]
My momma went to jail when I was only nine
Fresh out [?] walk cash talk
Served an undercover baby that's how she got in trouble
Momma jeans was the hustle daddy was the muscle
I screamed fuck the world when my daddy died
Told my momma wipe her eyes it's gon' be alright
We got [?] here that what got me going in
Sellin' bags now
Money pourin' in

[Chorus: Quavo]
I told my momma I'ma see a hunnid bands
I told my momma I'ma get her in that Lamb
I told me momma she ain't gon' never need a man
As long as her son playin' with them bands
My momma my momma my momma my momma
My momma my momma my momma my momma
I told my momma I'ma see a hunnid bands
I told me momma she ain't gon' never need a man
