[Chorus: Offset]
I put the streets on beast (streets)
I been geeked all week (geeked)
I go to sleep, I don't eat (sleep), cross-eyed, make a nigga go weak (uh)
Yeah, gas tank on E, yeah, but the safe on full (full)
Yeah, got the heart of a lion (huh), yeah, head's on like a bull (bull)
Yeah, nigga talk real fast (huh), 'til I got the cash and I ran past (racks)
Ooh, grandma on my ass tellin' me, "Boy, you movin' too fast" (grandma, ayy)
Cash deposits, get the kicks just to match the watches (woo, woo, woo, woo)
Hit the gas and harrass the ‘rari, diamonds bitin', this glass is water

[Verse 1: Offset]
Yeah, came in the game, tryna aim for the best
Chain for the gang, ain't bought this shit (gang bang)
Everybody 'round me sellin' cold bricks (freeze)
We let it fly with the fire with no kick (brrr)
I don't wanna unify with no clique (who?)
Thirty plus a .45 on my wrist (woo)
42 on the dial, that's a big shield (yeah)
Livin' life, wanna vibe with my bitch (ayy)
500K to the cancer (woo)
Come ride with the wave, but I'm handsome (wave)
Givin' back to the face of the planet (givin' back)
Then I bust out a chain with a niner (bust down)
Ain't shit basic, baby (basic), ain't 'bout to feed you fugazi, baby (baby)
Yeah, I'm from the nawf side, baby, you're fuckin' with a big dog, all-star, baby (ayy)
My heart is so numb, I cannot cry, I don't got feelings (no, woo)
Up to par and I'm on fire and I got millions (and I'm on fire)
Smokin' on cookie, it end up in ashes for all my niggas (smokin' on cookie)
I'm only fuckin' with gang 'cause I cannot fuck with these niggas (gang)

[Chorus: Offset]
I put the streets on beast (streets)
I been geeked all week (geeked)

Yeah, got the heart of a lion (huh), yeah, head's on like a bull (bull)
Yeah, nigga talk real fast (huh), 'til I got the cash and I ran past (racks)
Ooh, grandma on my ass tellin' me, "Boy, you movin' too fast" (grandma, ayy)
Cash deposits, get the kicks just to match the watches (woo, woo, woo, woo)
Hit the gas and harrass the ‘rari, diamonds bitin', this glass is water (argh)

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
The streets on beast (beast), I'ma put the streets on me (streets on me)
She suck me to sleep (sleep), told her, "don't put your teeth on me" (your teeth on me)
Ridin' 'round in a Range, ain't worried 'bout a thing and the thing on me (brrrp)
Switch lanes with your main thing, I been with the gang in L.A all week (skrrt, I'm lyin')
I got the dogs with me (dogs) and I'ma let 'em off the leash (off)
She keep callin' me (call) 'cause the sheets on leak (drip, splash)
Ain't shit basic, baby, ain't 'bout to feed you for free (no, no)
Ain't no fugazi, baby, naw these diamonds ain't cheap (hell nah)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Beat on my chest, beast, Huncho, King Kong (beast, beast)
You singin' 'bout the bando, Nat King Cole (Nat King Cole)
Solitaires, bounce, diamonds ping-pong (ping-pong)
Make you wrist trap and hit a ringtone (brrrp)
Grandma got wings, she flew straight home (grandma, yeah)
Now we count all of the blessings thrown (count 'em, count 'em, yeah)
Big boy ice, all in the necklace, froze (froze)
Pause, but I put all of my besties on
Lookin' like a lion on the streets (yeah), lookin' like a lion 'bout to feast (feast)
Pop one, he'll go beast (pop one), represent the Land of the Free (free)
But some of my niggas in the cell (cell), so I don't even know what that mean (no)
