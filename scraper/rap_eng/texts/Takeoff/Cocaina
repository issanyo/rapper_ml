[Verse 1: Quavo]
Turn a half to a whole thing
With cocaina you will make a name
If you wanna make a mountain
Gotta turn that kitchen to a hurricane
Trapping out the boarded houses
Don’t go check the door without John Wayne
All white bricks, plain Jane
Pure Cocaina Cane, Cocaina cane
Have you ever seen a drop before?
Have you ever seen a drought? (hell nah)
Have you ever seen a pot before?
Fishscale jumping out
Everybody know cocaina make the whole world turn around
Out in Venezuela talking cocaina with the plug right now

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Cocaina, call it Miley Cyrus
Actavis ‘cause we don’t drink that wise shit
They talking about the Migos we spreading like we a virus
Thinking about running up on me, think I’m sweet, I wouldn’t advise it
Diamonds build our temperature up, fucking run it to the closet
Chopper make you do whatever I say niggas call me Simon
Money growing like Pinocchio, nigga, but I ain’t lying
Most of these bitches ain’t mine, I fuck them then move down the line
See that cocaina gon’ bring you to crime
And that cocaina gon’ start bringing the fire
But get caught with that cocaina get time
You been fucking up and run at the wrong time
It can be a crumb they gon’ charge you like it’s a dime
Looking at my neck and wrist like why I can’t shine
Looking at the i8 like why can’t I ride?
Cocaina come out the boat and it’s certified
