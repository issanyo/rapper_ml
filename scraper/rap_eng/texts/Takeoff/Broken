[Hook]
I'm sorry, I never thought you knew that
Living in pain, man what a pain
Lost in the dark, I went out
I'm sorry, I never thought you knew that

[Verse 1]
All ya'll wanted me to do was show up
Turning up in the building, music was my life
I let it all get to me
I'd lost my spirit, back to the darkness

[Bridge]
I haven't shown up, I'm sorry to all my fans
Gave ya'll the bad news, I should've kept it to myself
I'm a kindle soul, I have no soul
Black soul, black soul, roaming through my body

[Verse 2]
I been a bad guy, gave everyone the attitude
Promoting the negativity, everyone was surprised
Gotten to many fights, almost died once again
I'm sorry, I never thought you knew that
They call me a bully, a major savage
I came at her crew, then later apologized
Rapper gone soft, then I gone broke
I'm sorry, I never thought you knew that

[Hook]
I'm sorry, I never thought you knew that
Living in pain, man what a pain
Lost in the dark, I went out
I'm sorry, I never thought you knew that
