(I got it for the low low)

[Chorus: Cook LaFlare]
I got it for the low low
Speed racing to these racks I'm in turbo
I've been trippin'
I might paint the foreign indigo
OG use to cook the dope up like a casserole
I smash off in my coupe I'm important
I play with the fish like I'm snorkeling
I use to get them birdies from Portland
Money only thing that's important

[Verse 1: Cook LaFlare]
I got cheese like nachos
I'm the head huncho
Walkin' with them ponchos
You cheap like Aeropostale
More hoes than a Bronco
100 (?), going full throttle
Pint of red lean, sip it out the bottle
I'm directing fiends don't get off at hoppo
I'm like Aristotle
We got gold bottles
All these diamonds dancing, all these strippers dancing
100 models in and out of my Miami mansion
All these hunnids coming, my pockets expanding
When I say I'm flippin' fish not talkin' chowder salmon
I'm ruthless like a pirate and I keep a cannon

[Chorus: Cook LaFlare]
I got it for the low low
Speed racing to these racks I'm in turbo
I've been trippin'
I might paint the foreign indigo
OG use to cook the dope up like a casserole
I smash off in my coupe I'm important
I play with the fish like I'm snorkeling
I use to get them birdies from Portland
Money only thing that's important

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Take-Takeoff!

Thumbin' through, thumbin' through dead guys
I take a trip and I'm like
We fuck you bitch and I'm giving them creampies
I only drank on that actavis
Niggas drinkin', and they drank lookin' terrified
Never was dumb, raised wise
Before I drank they commit suicide
My pockets stuffed, super-sized
You niggas lookin', like small fries
Migos plugged in, we got mob ties
Parallel parking that frog eyes
I got a fetish for dead guys
Fuck up that drank up in Bed Stuy
Me and Cookoff on the red eyes
Smokin' cookie back-to-back with red eyes
Drinkin' on act' out the bottle
While smoking a blunt of gelato
I never take pictures, but read up my nigga
'Cause people say I'm a role model
Cookie bag coming from (Cookie, Where?)
Cookie come from Colorado
Kickin' shit like I'm Ronaldo
In my mansion playing Where's Waldo

[Chorus: Cook LaFlare]
I got it for the low low
Speed racing to these racks I'm in turbo
I've been trippin'
I might paint the foreign indigo
OG use to cook the dope up like a casserole
I smash off in my coupe I'm important
I play with the fish like I'm snorkeling
I use to get them birdies from Portland
Money only thing that's important
