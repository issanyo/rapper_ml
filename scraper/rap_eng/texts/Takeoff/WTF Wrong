[Intro: Takeoff & Domingo]
Fuck going on over there man?
Man I don't know, we need to see what's up with his ass
What the fuck that nigga keep looking at?
Ay fuck nigga
Squad
Migo
Gang

[Hook: Takeoff]
What the fuck wrong with this nigga
Looking at me like he know a nigga
Acting like he been out in the field with a nigga
Looking at me real funny like I owe a nigga
Since you looking I'ma give you something to look at
It's a heart attack, 100 racks in my MCM bookbag
I’m QC but think I signed with double-M-G cause all these Maybachs
Abandoned houses with the boards on the windows where I trap at

[Verse 1: Domingo]
I got it on my own, I don’t owe nobody shit
Everybody kick them doors, we all hit them licks
Robbed the plug for the pounds, it was just me and Vic
Couple months later in the county, fuck nigga snitched
Rest in peace my nigga Pistol, Imma take off like a missile
On the northside with the  pistol, you can come get your issue
Posting Instagram pictures, nigga swear to god I’ll hit ya
Pull up with extensions, 30 round clips, no witness
Made it to the top, you a witness
Pour a 6 in the two liter, got to say it’s killer for my kidneys
Nigga tell me what I owe, with Migo gang, started on the North
I remember when I was really kicking down them doors
And when we had beef I was pulling up to shows
And when I got locked up stayed ten toes
Real nigga Willie Mac sent down the road
My nigga Mac I swear to god he never fold
Yes I did 5, time to come home
Julius Caesar, I’m moving back to Rome
I’m on go with the tools, nigga one to the dome
In your trap spot, leave your block hot
Repping real gangster but I know you’re really not
I'm in the bando nigga, with my wrist in the pot
Boogers on my watch, yeah my wrist full of snot
John Wall nigga, I’m a fool with the rock
LeBron James nigga, know I got to keep the blocks
Hell naw fuck nigga, you don’t know me
Since I was 19, chasing all the better Rollies
24 pounds on the block, no Kobe
Got some pounds overseas, you pass em like Ginobli
Hit her first night, now she acting like she know me
Never ever cuff her, I just pass her to my homie
Came a long way from the bread and baloney
Smile on my face but I know it’s really phony
So I keep a MAC to your extra cheese, macaroni
Got a 9 on my waist, like a Cowboy, no Tony
Making plays in the trap like your nigga playing Sony
Narcotic buffet, I should open up Shoney's
All these blue hundreds in my money book bag
Come here nigga, give you som’n to look at
No Ross but I pull up Maybach
I’m a young rich nigga, YRN, hashtag

[Hook: Takeoff]
What the fuck wrong with this nigga
Looking at me like he know a nigga
Acting like he been out in the field with a nigga
Looking at me real funny like I owe a nigga
Since you looking I'ma give you something to look at
It's a heart attack, 100 racks in my MCM bookbag
I’m QC but think I signed with double-M-G cause all these Maybachs
Abandoned houses with the boards on the windows where I trap at

[Verse 2: Mango Foo]
Ice so cold, catch a heart attack
Racks staying in my pocket like quarterbacks
Pussy nigga better get back
Put a strap to the back of your hat, like a motherfucker started here
Chopper gone stretch a nigga out like a jumping Jack
Leave him on the side of the building with the alley cats
In the bando, got pounds like a hashtag
Migo my gang, and I bang, I don’t need a flag (Migo Gang, squad)
Picking niggas off with the rifle, Mango a sniper
Bullets coming fast like a viper, niggas standing round like a cypher
Everybody looking at me cause I’m an idol
I’m married to the money, I didn’t need no recital
I promise to never go broke, put that on the bible
If a nigga want a problem, Imma pull up with the dirty rifle
And a clip longer than the fucking Eifel tower
Imma have it raining bullets, everybody take a shower
Money bring power, I don’t give a fuck have a nigga in the dirt
With a stone on his head with a name carved in it
With the motherfucking flowers
Still got two twin choppers like the towers
Riding with the pocket rocket, no Dwight Howard
Still got long clips, I’m shooting for an hour
Man you thinking she is sweet, I’ll leaver her smelling sour
Feeling like Rick Ross, I pull up in the Maybach
AR like Lysol, you know Imma spray that
Money on your head like a motherfucking a hat
You talking like the radio, nigga we don’t play that
MCM bag full of hundreds, trapping and capping
I’m on the stove like Benihanas
Stay with them bands, these nigga thinking I’m a drummer
Heavy artillery, niggas thinking I’m Osama
Leave you with injuries once I hit you with the thunder
My plug is in Italy getting babies by the bundles
Usain Bolt, I turn a nigga to a runner
When I was jumping the fence, I never ever did stumble
We be stomping niggas out like a frat
[?] the beat, crazy with the act
Never been a rat but I stayed in the trap
All my niggas kicking door for the sack
Pull up in the trenches don’t fuck with the nats
Niggas want to kick it like karate Max
Toe tag, put em in the body bag
Trapping and dabbing, nigga fuck swag
The bando got babies like the Rugrats
Call of Duty with my niggas in the field
And everybody shot, head shot, shoot to kill
These niggas rap about it, but we do the shit for real
Pouring up a whole four out the double seal

[Hook: Takeoff]
What the fuck wrong with this nigga
Looking at me like he know a nigga
Acting like he been out in the field with a nigga
Looking at me real funny like I owe a nigga
Since you looking I'ma give you something to look at
It's a heart attack, 100 racks in my MCM bookbag
I’m QC but think I signed with double-M-G cause all these Maybachs
Abandoned houses with the boards on the windows where I trap at
