[Intro: DJ Khaled, Humongous The God, & Takeoff]
Ayo, check this out
It's DJ Khaled and Humongous The God, salute
Florida stand up
In Gwalla We Trust, the mixtape
Let's go
(I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich)
Shit, aye bruh
Wussup?
See that white van parked outside the trap over there?
Fuck
Fools look like jump out
Fuck that is?
Got a nigga paranoid and shit
Ayo, fuck that
Rico!
Aye!
Clean out trap, man
Hurry up, hurry up
Hit the bando!
Hurry up, man
Twelve!
Fuck
Another one
Huh, huh, huh, huh

[Chorus: Humongous The God]
All these white vans give a nigga paranoia
Make me wanna grab all my gwalla and hit the border
Cause I ain't worth them late nights just to surrender my gwalla
Pedal to the metal if them white vans start to follow
White vans, white vans, white vans
White vans, give a nigga paranoia
White vans, white vans, white vans
White vans, skrrrr, Boom! Get down!
White vans

[Verse 1: Humongous The God]
No texting while driving
But in Texas, I'm driving while countin' them hundreds
I'm blunted, and plus, I've been sipping more lean than a fountain
Don't need no accountant, got money counters on the kitchen counter to count it, I got it
Hit a poppy then double my profit
Hoes get astonished when a dope boy accomplish that kilo
We call that shit balling
Cause when they get it they toss it like free throw
Fuck boy, I don't wanna be your [?] migo
Hoe know that boy right there rap like a Migo
Cause that boy really a Migo
They got him a clique full of Migos
They got them come clips full
And will blow this bitch up, like some C4
I'm all about my dough [?]
I do this right here for my people
Fuck tryna do this to meet hoes
Why the fuck these white vans follow me for?
More money mean they gonna talk more
I'm running up the walls, no parkour
Smash your bitch head off, all force
She like my whip cause it's new and it cost more
I'm just trapping till a young nigga on tour
Pray the trap lord that a young nigga make it
Only 19, with my first milly, made it
[?] make it hard like she naked
I ain't never been a pig, no bacon
Betty Crocker in the kitchen, no bacon
If I see and I want it, I'ma take it
Pedal to the metal, like I'm racing
Hope them white vans get ready for the chasing

[Chorus: Humongous The God]
White vans, white vans, white vans
White vans, give a nigga paranoia
White vans, white vans, white vans
White vans, skrrrr, Boom! Get down!
White vans, white vans, white vans
White vans, give a nigga paranoia
White vans, white vans, white vans
White vans, skrrrr, Boom! Get down!
White vans
All these white vans give a nigga paranoia
Make me wanna grab all my gwalla and hit the border
Cause I ain't worth them late nights just to surrender my gwalla
Pedal to the metal is them white vans start to follow

[Verse 2: Takeoff]'
White van, white van
On the block, we don't talk to the white man
Plug, he just dropped me some work from Afghanistan
Too many bengies', can't fit in a rubber band
Never played major league, but pitch it underhand
You pillow-talk to these hoes, like [?]
[?], walk around with the [?]
Don't got a pipe, then they smoke out a soda can
I'm in the bando coolin' with my jeweler
It's a shooter at the door with a ruger
Look out the window when I see an intruder
B-b-b-bow! My nigga we shootin'
Takin' pictures, don't know the feds on the computer
You stupid, my nigga, [?]
You know that them people that searchin' for Migos and Humongous, my nigga, not talkin' Google
Light up that cookie, it smellin' like [?]
[?] lookin' like [?]
Fuck your plug, my nigga, come shop with me
Price is low and my dope is newer
Bro on the west-side, he doin' ten
[?], I'll never see him again
[?], forgive me for my sins
[?], the police and them white vans

[Chorus: Humongous The God]
White vans, white vans, white vans
White vans, give a nigga paranoia
White vans, white vans, white vans
White vans, skrrrr, Boom! Get down!
White vans, white vans, white vans
White vans, give a nigga paranoia
White vans, white vans, white vans
White vans, skrrrr, Boom! Get down!
White vans
All these white vans give a nigga paranoia
Make me wanna grab all my gwalla and hit the border
Cause I ain't worth them late nights just to surrender my gwalla
Pedal to the metal is them white vans start to follow
White vans
