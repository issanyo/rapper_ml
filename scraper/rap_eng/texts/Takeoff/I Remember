[Intro]
Yeah
Uh, oh yeah
Uh huh, I remember
M-M-M-Murda
I do remember

[Chorus]
I remember, I remember, I remember (I)
I remember, I remember, I remember (I remember that)
I can't forget, I can't forget, I can't forget it (I can't forget)
I remember, I remember, I remember (Remember that)
I remember, I remember, I remember (Yes I remember)
I remember, I remember, I remember (Oh, I remember)
I can't forget it, can't forget it, can't forget it (Never forget)
I remember, I remember, I remember (I remember)

[Verse 1]
I remember, I remember, I remember (I remember)
It was cold  as hell and it wasn't even Christmas (Ice)
Still wrapped around the head like it was winter
I remember we was trappin' out the red fender bender
Trapping out the house with boards on the window, I remember (Bando)
Real gorilla, it wasn't just a song, Domingo did get him
Been a savage, man my niggas done had cases after cases
Go to places, come back break the suitcase down in mama's basement
Ain't care nothin' bout no races, where you from, you get it all ages
I remember smokin' niggas, before Backwood, it was papers
Reminiscing 'bout that purp I used to smoke just like the Lakers
I'm a jazz musician, came from Utah, Derrick Favors

[Chorus]
I remember, I remember, I remember (I)
I remember, I remember, I remember (I remember that)
I can't forget, I can't forget, I can't forget it (I can't forget)
I remember, I remember, I remember (Remember that)
I remember, I remember, I remember (Yes I remember)
I remember, I remember, I remember (Oh, I remember)
I can't forget it, can't forget it, can't forget it (Never forget)
I remember, I remember, I remember (I remember)

[Verse 2]
I remember, I remember, I remember (What you remember?)
I remember it was 'round winter time (Swear)
Locked up in the studio with 1479 (Swear)
5:30 roundhouse, that's when I ain't have a dime (Nah)
'Til I started hitting licks and walkin' out with diamonds (Licks)
Was a Michael Kors, now that Rolex perfect timing (Ice)
I remember flushin' all the dope down the commode
Stashin' work where were you would never know, canine can't even find it (Find)
Free my nigga still locked up in confinement  (Free)
Go get some ice, gon' make me bring them out retirement (Do that)
Remember nights I'm sellin' product to environments (I'm sellin' dope)
Remember when we ran from 12, ain't ran a mile since (Ain't ran a mile)

[Chorus]
I remember, I remember, I remember (I)
I remember, I remember, I remember (I remember that)
I can't forget, I can't forget, I can't forget it (I can't forget)
I remember, I remember, I remember (Remember that)
I remember, I remember, I remember (Yes I remember)
I remember, I remember, I remember (Oh, I remember)
I can't forget it, can't forget it, can't forget it (Never forget)
I remember, I remember, I remember (I remember)

[Outro]
I remember, I remember, I remember
