[Intro]
That boy Cassius

[Chorus]
Fast lane, nigga, soul chain, drippin' real fame
Whole gang geekin' on the plane like it's Soul Plane
What's your name? Catch a stain, all we know is gangbang
What you gon' do if I front you a couple of them things? (What you gon' do?)
Block hot, leave the spot, gotta have patience
Didn't know what a bando was 'til we said it's vacant (Bando)
One point two, I cash out in casinos out in Vegas (One point two)
Give me my cash and money, my nigga, no time for no wait (No)

[Verse 1]
All my fingers achin' (Achin')
I'm in love with faces (Faces)
Niggas pump-fakin' (Pump)
And I remember faces (Faces)
I've been through the phases (Phases)
Let me out the cages (Cages)
Heard that you was slavin' (Slavin')
Minimum, your wages (Wages)
I'm on front pages (Pages)
My pinky ring your savings (Savings)
Hope you don't think I'm flexin' (Flexin')
My necklace, your checkings (Checkings)
I am an investor ('Vestor)
So I make investments (Cash)
Plain Jane got me talkin' proper etiquette (Proper)
Your main thing say she faithful, she with all the shits (All the shit)
I might take a startin' five, make 'em sit that bench (Sit down)
Make me grip the whole fire, 'cause I see you're tense (Tense)
I done steal some cookies off that planet, still dense (Cookie)
Codeine, I drank the last drop, I can't leave a drip (Lean)
I poured a four, the glass top, jumpin' off the cliff (Lean)
Poppin' big shit and we jumpin' out the VIP
Niggas jumpin' out their skin, got you runnin' out your flips (Run)
I'ma get that bread, like potato, I want chips
Suck that, bitch, it's still head if she let it touch her lips
Fast car's fast, I might drag, then I drift (Fast car)
I'm here for the cash, get that bag, then I dip (Bye)

[Chorus]
Fast lane, nigga, soul chain, drippin' real fame
Whole gang geekin' on the plane like it's Soul Plane
What's your name? Catch a stain, all we know is gangbang
What you gon' do if I front you a couple of them things? (What you gon' do?)
Block hot, leave the spot, gotta have patience
Didn't know what a bando was 'til we said it's vacant (Bando)
One point two, I cash out in casinos out in Vegas (One point two)
Give me my cash and money, my nigga, no time for no wait (No)

[Verse 2]
Trappin' at the station (Trappin')
Trappin' different places (Trappin')
Ballin' like the Pacers
But they keep on foulin', flagrant
I'm the chosen one
Was picken by the man, ain't no mistake
Don't need no Twitter or no Insta for no stamp of verification
That coupe look like a caterpillar
Came and pulled it straight from Haiti
Put that cookie in rotation
Hotboxin', no ventillation
All of my bitches, they different in races
Go get the bag, then stack it and save it
Givin' him work to see what he do with it
You want your life, or you want the paper? (Pick one)
The things ain't right
I pick up the can, I'm aimin' at faces
So you better think twice (Twice)
'Fore you try to rob or you try to play me
No, well, she not the wife (No)
But she want the dick and she want a baby (Baby)
I'm livin' my life (Life)
The ups and downs, I'm goin' through phases (Phases)

[Chorus]
Fast lane, nigga, soul chain, drippin' real fame
Whole gang geekin' on the plane like it's Soul Plane
What's your name? Catch a stain, all we know is gangbang
What you gon' do if I front you a couple of them things? (What you gon' do?)
Block hot, leave the spot, gotta have patience
Didn't know what a bando was 'til we said it's vacant (Bando)
One point two, I cash out in casinos out in Vegas (One point two)
Give me my cash and money, my nigga, no time for no wait (No)
