[Intro : Rambo Gotti]
Ain't no drought
Ain't no drought
Spray you in yo mouth
Shoot you in house yea yea yea

[Verse 1 : Rambo Gotti]
Never had a girl cause I was always busy
Nowadays i round i ride around in my two four fifty
Never had that job but I always had that work
If you gon diss me its gon take more then dirt
Rambo had hoes but i had to let em know
Girl you only hear for one night and nothing'mo
I just fucked up my trues gotta hit the sto
Always got my pole so you best not try me hoe
Could play ball, ballin' like Vick (ballin' like Vick)
Stopped hittin players started hittin licks
People pop up like some fuckin zits
But when you ain't nun they treat you like shit
Stick and im movin', movin' side to side (aye aye)
And big body and your girl love to ride
Why yall keep buggin acting like some fucking flies
Gotta get that raid spray till yall fucking die
Yea i came from nothin' but im tryna make it out
Dont try to pop up where was yall when shit was going south?
Thats why im quiet i don't even up my mouth
Now im grindin tryna make sure theres no fuckin drought

[Hook: Rambo Gotti]
Yea we use to talk you needa let it go
Came in with the forty hadda let it blow
Never catching feelings thought i'd letchu know
Been jumped off the porch like Geronimo

[Verse 2: Slim Boi D]
All my niggas balling they be shootin like the heat
Nigga i ain't talking basketball im talking bout that piece
Imma pull up on a nigga flippin medicine that lean
I got foreign to the goop talking straight promethazine
Slim boi with hoes, man you know that nigga nice
Niggas gettin so damn high  sippin on that dirty sprite
Niggas gettin  high taking flight just like a kite
Droppin tracks in the studio we do this every night
Slim Boi D that nigga droppin' bars on the track
Imma mix match designer homie you know i dont match
Gettin top from a thot SBD he a man , and im tryna get
These bands so might pull up to the trap
Gotta get that money so i put it in a mattress
Shoutout Drizzy Cizzy got the pistol he gon pack it
Gettin all this money man you know I had to stack it
Countin all this twenties man you know that that's a habit (yea yea)

[Verse 3: Drizzy Cizzy]
Ever since a youngin'  I was roamin round the streets
I was dead broke I ain't have money to eat
I remember havin niggas ask me "20 for a lease"
Now I got them same niggas giving me a fuckin beat
I ain't care bout a nigga unless, he talking green
Niggas say the fucking riding till shit be gettin steep
You know how I'm rocking yo bitch she give me sloppy
No Ricky bitch I'm Bobby Rambo with a thottie (yo bitch she call me bobby)


[Hook: Rambo Gotti]
Yea we use to talk you needa let it go
Came in with the forty hadda let it blow
Never catching feelings thought i'd letchu know
Been jumped off the porch like Geronimo


[Bridge: Rambo Gotti]
Keep on playin' imma have to fuckin blow
Come on baby yea I got that fuckin blow
Got a beamer truck I don't want no Rove
And you know I just poured  me up a four

[Verse 4 : Lil Shmo]
Ridin' round the city with my children Mac and Nina
And I know that bitch a baddie man I think that girl Latina
I been servin' all this white like a fucking country singer
Throwing up b's just dont try to catch a stinger
My ex when she left said she movin' on to better things
But I been on the come up so i know she gon remember me
I gotta keep on going till my pockets stay forever green
Got this rollie on my wrist and it just looks so heavenly

Siamese twins how i hold that money close
And time is really money so I got no time for hoes
I remember reading books and now they got me booking shows
I forget a lotta shit but I will not forget my bros ( thats my team yeaa)
