[Intro: Quavo]
I wanna say, you always going out your way
Cancel all your plans, you will understand
You probably got your hands full, whatever goal you pursue
All this pain, we can live through it, it's called success

[Hook: Quavo]
You always going out your way
You always dropping off your flav, yeah
You always going out your way
You never ask me to repay, no
You always going out your way, yeah yeah, ooh
You always going out your way, yeah, ooh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I won't ask the bitch unless she goin' to get it
It might take a minute, but she'll be sure to get it
Just to pass the test, I won’t act the best
I got Actavis, there's nothing I can't ask the bitch, no
Not one missed call, no missed calls, hell nah, nah
She got a man, can't get involved, no, nah, nah
She still going all ways every time I call
We gonna ball today, aye, we gonna ball tomorrow
I put this weight on like I put a cape on
Now that this fame came, I can see the hate on you
Mama told me stay strong, grandma told me stay on
Now she looking down, throwin' blessings

[Hook: Quavo]
You always going out your way
You always dropping off your flav, yeah
You always going out your way
You never ask me to repay, no
You always going out your way, yeah yeah, ooh
You always going out your way, yeah, ooh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Go out your way and come out
Go out your way to mom's house
Go out your way, so out your way
You going out your way to come back around
You go out your way, you keep cool
You go out your way, you break rules
Go out your way, so out your way
You're going out your way, you can't lose
Vacay trips to Cancun, spaceships, trips to the moon
Never likes to tell the truth
Head full of hair, but the cat well groomed
Plan a trip to Peru (plan it), charter jet, me and you
You going out your way, way out your way
So I had to do this for you
Jackpot, hit the right spot, so she had to get a tattoo
It's some dirt and hurt, but ain't perfect
And she gone always, come through
Hold me down, either good or bad
Never switch or act brand new
Go out your way and wasn't told to
So I made this song just for you

[Hook: Quavo]
You always going out your way
You always dropping off your flav, yeah
You always going out your way
You never ask me to repay, no
You always going out your way, yeah, yeah, ooh
You always going out your way, yeah, ooh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Offset]
I put my heart and my soul in it
Get to the money, then double it
All of these bitches, they loving me
But you had my back from the other beef (yeah)
She bending over, back for me
Made a deal that you wouldn't cross, lie to me
It was so many people that doubted me
Shit talk, shit talk, bullets start to let off
Jack Frost, Jack Frost, wrist cost a whole house
Blast off, blast off, my career gon' blast off
We don't need y'all, want y'all, we don't have to ask y'all
I been fucking on the gnats, nigga, all day
Ride through the city, yeah, the ball way
We was trappin', cappin' all through the hallway
Everybody said that we would fall away
Nobody thought that we would go up
But we blew up, blew up, blew up
Fuckin' on a thot on the tour bus
Going out your way for the two of us

[Hook: Quavo]
You always going out your way
You always dropping off your flav, yeah
You always going out your way
You never ask me to repay, no
You always going out your way, yeah, yeah, ooh
You always going out your way, yeah, ooh
Yeah, yeah
