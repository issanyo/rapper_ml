[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Sha-Shabba Ranks, Sha-Sha-Shabba Ranks
Eight gold rings like I'm Sha-Shabba Ranks
Four gold chains like I'm Sha-Shabba Ranks
One gold tooth like I'm...

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Who that stocky nigga with the grills?, Trap Lord you're so trill
I could get a new Bugatti but a nigga rather chill
Rather sit up on the block and stack it 'till I get a mill
What about them old bitches who ain't wanna give me feel?
Now they want a make it gucci cause a nigga got a deal
Rather double up and strap and hit a booty in Brazil
I hit Punta Cana when shit gets so real
Two bad bitches in my vehicle
Yellow hood rats like Pikachu
Hit it from the back got em screaming like
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH like Yeezus do
Bringing rappers from the dead like Jesus do
Can't call them bone thugs cause they eating dude
I bust-a-rhyme and flip-mode, speak the flu
Nigga Ya Ya Ya eat ya crew
Butter pecan, Puerto Rican, be freakin' the deacon'
A hood pope get good throat, I'm skeetin' the sheets
She feelin' my team, I asked her if she feelin' The Weeknd
Cause a nigga like she give head while you're singin'
I'ma get the bread while I'm breathin'
I'm the rookie of the year and you better believe it
I be barkin' like a Que like im very collegiate!
Like I'm Pedigree eatin'

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Meetin' up the plug at a QuikTrip
Young nigga had to make that money back flip
I'm trappin' with accuracy
Gold on my toilet like Master P
Lil' mama, she drunk off a daiquiri
Shabba Ranks my pinky finger, please
You mad cause you workin' at Mickey D's
Young nigga, I'm flexin' like Hercules (flex, flex!)
You can take her to the movie and go watch a film
A$AP Ferg, front me a pelican
Lean, lean, lean, that's my medicine
Quavo, old money, Sega Genesis

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Takeoff got ten gold rings, bling, bling, bling
For tryna take my rings, gun go bang
Cashed out on the jeweler, ching
Got 'em feelin' like Martin Luther King, I had a dream
Actavis, I only sip
And begin with a beam by extending my clip
If I see the police, grab my chips and I dip
Snapping my fingers, we fillin' arenas
I flip up the Hannah Montana in real
I feel like that Keyshia Ka'oir
That double AK-47's, they aim at your lip
Versace, Givenchy, this shit is ridiculous
SHABBA!

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Look, nigga, get it straight, you could never fuck with my clique, boy
Aww shit, quick, hit you with the drop kick jaw
Bone break, you can see the way the clock tick, tock, tick
Funny all these niggas stop, bitch boy
Bust' Rhymes back up in the cockpit, spit toxic, always givin' niggas hot shit, boy
Niggas see me shinin' 'til he's sick, sick, sick
Any bitch really want Islam dick, boy
So much jewelry, nigga lookin' priceless out here
A lot of rappin' niggas lookin' lifeless out here
Kill 'em 'til they say a nigga triflin' out here
And you can let 'em talk, you know who the nicest out here
Vroom, vroom, vroom! Bite dust pussy
Better get low when yu hear de shot buss, pussy
Every time I come here, know I body niggas fully
Godfather with it while I murder little rookie
And I'm bigger than your shorty though her pussy kinda bushy
Fuckin' on the low, Versace logo on the hoodie
Airhorn blow, my nigga, bwam bwam bwam
Let it go, you already know what's really goodie
Killin' shit like I'm some kind of cancer
Bag your bitch, now she my private dancer
I don't understand why niggas feel like they have to ask who the god is
When you know what's the answer
Chokehold shit 'til they be callin' me strangler
Hundred million dollars, safe behind the plasma
Proper with it, 'til he spread the propaganda
And when I TEC talk, can we pop your man up
On my Sha-Shabba Ranks, on my Sha-Shabba Ranks nigga
Gettin' so much money, it's like I just robbed a bank, nigga
