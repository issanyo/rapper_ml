[Verse 1: Lil Bex]
These are my hoes
I'm on a boat
On my way home
I'm bout to die
Eating some pie
I'm bout to run
All over ya mum
I'm bout to rhyme
On my dime
I'm bout to eat a boat
On my little coat
I'm bout to sing
My Merry Christmas song
I think I can rap
Singer
You think you're fat
But you're really a Bimmer
You think you're fat
But you're really fat

[Outro: PG Block]
Where are your ankles bro?
I don't see them
(They're like right there)
Cause you lost them
Cause I broke them
