Mister ice cream man (x4)
I'm sellin' ice cream (x2)
Mister ice cream man (x4)
I'm sellin' ice cream (x2)

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
I'm sellin' ice cream and popsicles
I'm sellin' all ladies and skittles
24's on the ice cream truck, got the pots and the pans
Yeah I'm bout to cook it up (whip, whip!)

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Sippin' on lean like slushy
Got a foreign bad bitch, she Russian
Smoking on gas and musty
Got molly, got xans, got cookies

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Got coke, got dope and I get'em out the boat
Kids on the block kill for the ice cream cone
Xanax bar where the Klondike bar
Ice cream man I'm a real trap star

[Verse 4: Quavo]
Pull up on your block
Like Gucci brrt the whole block
Remixing, nigga rerock (remix!)
Them birds come in by the flock

[Hook. Quavo]

[Verse 5: Gucci Mane]
House full of mexican (que pasa)
Cook the dope one time again (muy bien)
Shooting dice cause I'm a gambling man (eres muy guapo )
Heroin from Afghanistan
El holmes I can't understand that
What you mean?  I don't talk english I can't comprehende
Fuck you mean? Got this F&N can you comprehende
Fuck them bricks, you said there where coming wednesday
