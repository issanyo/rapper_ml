[Hook: Skippa Da Flippa]
Carlos got a shipment back and in the front
And I’m thinking can I take it, confusing, I ash the blunt
Two migos jump out, with some German warfare choppers
But you know I got my chopper and my sniper is my partner
He out to get me, Carlos out to get me
Must’ve know I’m tryna hit him first, he out to get me
Out to get me, out to get me
Fifty bags and 100 cash, I’m tryna go get it

[Verse 1: Skippa Da Flippa]
Fifty them bags, 100 in cash, Imma go get it
Put a thing to his head
Whatever you with
You know that I’m with it
Grab his wallet
He said that he four five
Hit him bout four times
Then I go in the safe
Count up the digits
I leave four shells in his kidneys
Finessin the plug for quite a long time, I think it’s bout twenty times
Start off in the Chevy, turn up the treble, enjoy the alpine
My brother’s in the truck, [?] said it was love but he didn’t give a fuck
When we met at the safe house, we count up big buck and hear legos the truck

Must’ve know I’m tryna hit him first, he out to get me
Out to get me, out to get me
Fifty bags and 100 cash, I’m tryna go get it

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Carlos out to get me, nigga walk around town with a fully loaded extension
Carlos looking for 400 chickens, said don’t trap on my block, you got no permission
Take it to the trap and got to get it in, twenty migos in the caravan
More troops than Afghanistan, I’m coming for you like Uncle Sam
Niggas thinking that we trappin' no drought
You thinking bout leaving, then we hopping out
Pull up on a nigga with the Glock out, nothing but head shots like a stocking cap
Chopper make a nigga want to laugh, what’s that noise, is your phone tapped?
I seen a milli before the rap, I seen a brick before the trap
