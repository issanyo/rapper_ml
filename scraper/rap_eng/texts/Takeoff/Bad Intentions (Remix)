[Verse 1: Niykee Heaton]
This is the face I wear treading the riptide
Abysmal oceans where good girls go to die
I wanna love somebody, wanna feel their love all on me
But after everything, I still believe in true love
Not been able to find it, damn, it tears me up
And I know it's my fault, I know it's my fault
Let's take a trip, ten thousand miles above the clouds
We can stay up here until we figure it out
I don't wanna go home, don't wanna be alone, be alone

[Chorus: Niykee Heaton]
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I'm loving all the flaws, I'm loving all the flaws
I got bad intentions, I don't pay attention
'Cause I be on my dogs
I done traveled like ten thousand miles
Looking for someone to match my style
It always end up not working out
'Cause they not ready for my lifestyle
Is you the one I can talk to?
Is you the one I can call boo?
'Cause baby, I think I deserve you
I promise I'm never gon' doubt you
I know you're tired of me, know you're tired of me
One more chance, I'mma make you proud of me
I'll never give our love away, baby
Even if it's going down, down, down

[Chorus: Niykee Heaton]
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson

[Verse 3: Takeoff, Quavo, & Offset]
Takeoff
I got some bad intentions
Got some secrets that I forgot to mention
Baby, listen up
We been through pain but been through more success
But we promised to always tell how we feel
When it get hot, we get cooler
Put the past behind us, move on to the future
We listen to rumors made up by computers
You show me the best of your brain like a tutor
Deep down inside, I really wanna tell ya
When I pray for me, I pray we stay together
Show me your emotions, tell me all your feelings
Don't be scared to tell me whatever
I make mistakes, you make mistakes
You know that we can't be mad forever
And I didn't like that little game we played
I know that we gon' get better
From the first time I met you, knew that you were special
Told you to hold me down and never let up
When I had to sit down, you was writing letters
You told me to think about us, don't be selfish
Lay on your back, give it to me, I need it
I didn't have bad intentions when I cheated
Put your head on my shoulder like it's Tempur-Pedic
With no doubt, you know I got her back, I won't leave her
Offset

[Bridge: Niykee Heaton]
I know we've made a graveyard of this all
I know I don't feel too sober now
I wanna lie awake with your black soul
Count your fears if you let me

[Chorus: Niykee Heaton]
Baby, I just want your damn bad intentions
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson
