(Intro)
It's Pine
Oooh, ya
Oooh, ya
Oooh, ya

(Verse 1)
I got millions in my mind
And if that ain’t making sense
I’m gonna cut to the chase
Go take a Lyft, you’re not needed
I got tunnel vision and my dreams are at the end
I don’t have time for no fake bitch or friends
My legs are only heading in one direction
Soon to be on a stage with diamonds flexing
I have to be consistent and I’ve already learned that lesson
I can already see my dreams, but the road is congested
And ya with my madness I have there really is a method

(Chorus)
With the cards, I have been presented
It doesn’t tell me which way i’m heading
And no more being more reckless
And I got to get this shit perfected
Till I'm on that stage smoking legal lettuce

(Outro)
With the cards, I have been presented
It doesn’t tell me which way i’m heading
And no more being more reckless
And I got to get this shit perfected
Till I'm on that stage smoking legal lettuce
