Oh (M-m-m-Murda)

[Hook: Quavo]
Gimme the beat and I beat the bass
Gimme yo bitch and I beat her face
Gimme the pot and I beat the cake
Gimme the AK, I seize the place
Just gimme, mansion with acres (Migos)
Gimme, just gimme
Gimme, Gimme, Gimme
Gimme the beat and I be the bass
Gimme yo bitch and I beat her face
Gimme the pot and I be the cake
Gimme the AK, I seize the place
Just gimme, mansion with acres (DJ Durel!)
Gimme, just gimme
Gimme, Gimme, Gimme

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Gimme the pot and I give you a taste
[?] shoot 'em like bath salts
I got a bad bitch with me, mama said she came out of Nassau
Remember the day, my mama started crying
'Cause I pulled up in that NASCAR
My lil nigga [?] they callin him [?] cause he dope and he passed the test
Poppin percs and I dashed off
These rappers be acting like Hasselhoff
Passed you the rock and you scared to ball
I got yo lil bitch on a date at the mall
He know that you gone, she scared to call
When you get home she dead my dog
We came from the bottom ain't scared to fall (Nah! Nah!)
Been runnin from 12 my legs exhausted (Woo! Woo!)
12 racks in the wall can't plug in the sockets
I fit a hunnid ten racks in some pockets
Free all my niggas they eatin on pockets

[Hook: Quavo]
Gimme the beat and I be the bass
Gimme yo bitch and I beat her face
Gimme the pot and I be the cake
Gimme the AK, I seize the place
Just gimme, mansion with acres
Gimme, just gimme
Gimme, Gimme, Gimme
Gimme the beat and I be the bass
Gimme yo bitch and I beat her face
Gimme the pot and I beat the cake
Gimme the AK, I seize the place
Just gimme mansion with acres
Gimme, just gimme
Gimme, Gimme, Gimme
