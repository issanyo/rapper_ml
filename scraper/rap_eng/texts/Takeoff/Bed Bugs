[Chorus: Nessly]
Will you be there when the lean runs out
Tell my secrets, don't you run your mouth
Let you in but I might kick you out
Pull out something new and took a different route
I was changing your life which ain't a surprise
I give you the vibe, can't be created if you tried
If you mine once then you mine, got you forever for life
Don't mean I'm too good for you, just cause I'm in love with this ice

[Bridge]
I can't always catch you when you fall
I can't always answer when you call
You're always tryna get your friends involved
You need to chill out with that tripping in the mall

[Verse 1: Yung Pinch]
I was staying out the way, they be tryna’ ride my wave
But I ain't tripping on that, no, it's been forever and a day
I'm just trying keep it real, I just wanna get paid
I just want a couple mill, big house in the hills someday
Foreign outside of my driveway, shawty don't fly unless it's private
Whenever you round, she wanna leave
Whenever I’m there she excited
I got her wet like Poseidon
You hating don't try to deny it
I know that she willin', I know that she willin'
I know that she willin', she can't hide it

[Chorus; Nessly]
Will you be there when the lean runs out
Tell my secrets, don't you run your mouth
Let you in but I might kick you out
Pull out something new and took a different route
I was changing your life which ain't a surprise
I give you the vibe, can't be created if you tried
If you mine once then you mine, I give you the vibe
Can't be created if you tried, If you mine once then you mine
Got you forever for life, don't mean I'm too good for you
Just cause I'm in love with this ice

[Bridge]
I can't always catch you when you fall
I can't always answer when you call
You're always tryna get your friends involved
You need to chill out with that tripping in the mall

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
I can't always answer when you call (stop)
I can't always been there when you want (aw)
I can't always catch you when you fall (nope)
But I can make up for it when we ball
I'm talking bout the lean on rocks
Still have an active stock
I'm talking bout the price so high
So high have your stomach in knots
She told me she want attention
Don't like what I'm sipping
Said make decision
Then pour out my drink in the drain in the kitchen
But you tripping

[Chorus: Nessly]
Will you be there when the lean runs out
Tell my secrets, don't you run your mouth
Let you in but I might kick you out
Pull out something new and took a different route
I was changing your life
Which ain't a surprise
I give you the vibe
Can't be created if you tried
If you mine once then you mine
Got you forever for life
Don't mean I'm too good for you
Just cause I'm in love with this ice

[Bridge]
I can't always catch you when you fall
I can't always answer when you call
You're always tryna get your friends involved
You need to chill out with that tripping in the mall

[Outro]
Don't let the bed bugs bite you
Don't let the bed bugs bite you
Don't let the bed bugs bite you
Don't let the bed bugs bite you
Don't let the bed bugs bite you
Don't let the bed bugs bite you
Don't let the bed bugs bite you
Don't let the bed bugs bite you
