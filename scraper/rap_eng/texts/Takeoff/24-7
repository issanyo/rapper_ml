[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Twenty-four seven, I break them off 2015
I hop out, 2015 cars
Twenty-four seven, got Yung Rich Nation
Ain’t no need to go shop at the mall
But I buy 30 Balmains every fall
I pop the seal and pour up with my dogs
Twenty-four seven my migos on call
I think I’m the shit my nigga, where the stall?
Twenty-four seven, got molly, got xans, I got percs
I can see this nigga need a skirt
All of the sudden the whole world dabbin’
Ain’t gon’ say no names but who did it first?
Gave my lawyer 40K, beat the verdict
They knocked my brother, my feelings was hurt (Offset!)
I remember smoking gas with my partner
Fast forward, now my brother on a shirt (Pete!)
Twenty-four seven, I done did my dirt
Told the lord wash away sins and rebirth
If you ask me well I know what I’m worth
But I been grinding so long on this earth
Like the 300, had to claim my turf (had to)
Like I’m a rookie had to put in work (I had to)
Twenty-four seven, I’m sipping like I got a nervous
Real drank sippers know the thirst (lean, drank)

[Verse 2: Mango Foo]
I crush the block like it’s Tetris
24 karat, invisible set in my necklace
I whip the pot then I wreck it
I get a brick and dissect it
Fronted the plug, I hit him with the rerock
Pull up on you, killers hang out the T top
I got the pot in an ankle lock
Brought the chopper, now you run ‘til your ankle lock
Load up the bags and then jugg out the uber
My nigga touch ya keyboard, no computer
Bitch I’m a trapper turned rapper slash shooter
I keep the stick like I walk with a ruler
My niggas still be running from the feds
We shooting in the crowd, better watch your head
24k the bounty on his head
Shoot up the spot, now everybody scared
Migo my family, move like the mafia
I got a plug on the ice like a hockey puck
Bitch from Dubai and my diamonds Antarctica
Pull up and get the back end in a Sprinter bus
24 thousand blue Benjis the minimum
Flippa the 24, he gon’ get rid of him
24/7 he pussy, ain’t feeling him
24 banana clips and they peeling him
