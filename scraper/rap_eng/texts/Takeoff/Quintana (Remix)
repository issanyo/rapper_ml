[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Straight from Mexico, call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope
Swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope
Straight from Mexico, call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope
Swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope

[Verse 1: Quavo]
My bitch she bad, she foreign, she cookin', she trappin', Quintana
But if she smoke my dope, I'mma hang her on a rope
She naked, she cooking the coke, put it on a boat
The gas is coming from Mexico, Rambo
Come with a plug with the pounds and bowl
These hoes cannot take my soul
My niggas be hitting them juugs and licks
My nigga be flippin' the bricks
Excuse me, I take a shit
Skrrt, I juggled a chick
I pull up in Jags and Rovers and Benzes
My nigga we trappin', we rich

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Straight from Mexico, call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope
Swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope
Straight from Mexico, call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope
Swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Call it Quintana I got a bitch cooking Madonna she look like Rihanna
Got flavors like I'm Willy Wonka, no Tarzan I trap in the jungle
I'm whippin' and whippin' and flippin' and flippin'
I'm in the kitchen cookin' infants
The twins I'm whippin, Mary and Ashely
Got my jar smellin' like chitlins
My niggas we vicious no Sid
I’m bustin' I’m strapped and I’m Billy the Kid.”
And I'm sippin' on lean, two cups no lid
What you rap about I did
Forgive for sinning, I talk to the Lord I know what I did but I was a kid
Young Rich Nigga, I set the trend
Talkin' bout Benjamins, then I want in

[Bridge: A$AP Bari & Travis Scott]
La Flame, don't play no games
These niggas is lames
These niggas ain't lords, we the new lords
Mercy me, oh, mercy me
Mercy me, oh, mercy me
Mercy me, oh, mercy me

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Straight from Mexico, call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope
Swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope
Straight from Mexico, call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope
Swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope
