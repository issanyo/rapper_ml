[Hook: Takeoff]
Dirty, Dirty
Since I seen my first onion, I been counting filthy money fingers dirty
Grab that 2 liter Peach Crush and I contaminate that bitch until it's dirty
Never seen a bitch that looked that beautiful, but these diamonds she's really dirty
Can't trust a soul, don't know who be friend or foe, 12 killing niggas man this world is dirty, dirty
He think he shining but his diamonds really cloudy, he don't really know his jewelry really dirty, dirty
Moral of the story, got to keep your hands clean, nigga 12 can't wait to see 'em dirty

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
I been trapping out the bando all night, waiting for the pack to touchdown, man I hope that it ain't dirty
I been fucking with this bitch for a minute, took a trip and came back, man I hope that she ain't dirty
I be real nervous, hope that I don't get pulled over when I'm picking up them birdies, chameleons they riding dirty
Sipping on Codeine like it's water, wake up then piss in the morning looking at my piss like I've been drinking dirty
It's time to make a decision
Got to fuck one of these bitches
But I ain't gonna' roll the dice cuz' I know all of these bitches they dirty
If he talking like he really 'bout it
Ima' knock the money out his wallet
Give me the stick, Ima' knock the [?] dirty
I been counting up this money since I was a youngin' in the bando bugging
20 50's graduated to the 100, that's why a nigga fingernails dirty
Free my boy Offset, free Mango the Foo, free John Wick
They ain't did shit
And they still sit
Don't do a show in Statesboro, they'll do you dirty

[Hook: Takeoff]
Dirty, Dirty
Since I seen my first onion, I been counting filthy money fingers dirty
Grab that 2 liter Peach Crush and I contaminate that bitch until it's dirty
Never seen a bitch that looked that beautiful, but deep down inside she's really dirty
Can't trust a soul, don't know who be friend or foe, 12 killing niggas man this world is dirty, dirty
He think he shining but his diamonds really cloudy, he don't really know his jewelry really dirty, dirty
Moral of the story, got to keep your hands clean, nigga 12 can't wait to see 'em dirty

[Verse 2: Jose Guapo]
Riding 4 deep in the foreign and we riding dirty
If we get pulled over, we might get a 30
AR-15 with the beam, man the clip is dirty
She gone suck up the whole team, man this bitch is dirty
Pour a 4 inside a 20, man this bitch is muddy
I want a bitch that look like dime, counting dirty money
Most of these niggas they fake
Most of these niggas they dirty
That's why I just stay out the way
'Fore shit get real ugly
