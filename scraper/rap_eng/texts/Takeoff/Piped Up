[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
We dun brought the [?]
We too turnt up in this hoe
We too piped up in this bitch but we stay piped up
Said we dun brought the [?]
I designer all my clothes
Give a fuck about a bitch don't give a fuck about a hoe
We dun brought the [?]
We dun brought the [?]
I'm talk 'bout [?]

[Verse 1: Jose Guapo]
We dun brought the [?]
[?] fuck 'em all
Swear to God I'll catch a case if you try to rob
I'm a boss she can't catch me eatin' lobster
Who you think you playin' wit' we will get hostile
Make a play on my phone don't give a fuck
[?] all day long, nigga
Cash out and hit the store nigga (racks)
Nigga, I can fuck any hoe nigga
I'm too piped up that yo wrist not real
Don't give a fuck about a bitch

Pop a seal
Buy your bitch a pair of heels
I'm talkin' red bottoms, designer [?]

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
We too turnt up in this hoe
We too piped up in this bitch but we stay piped up
Said we dun brought the [?]
I designer all my clothes
Give a fuck about a bitch don't give a fuck about a hoe
We dun brought the [?]

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Both my niggas raw
Walkin' through your yard

Pullin' up with broads
But yo niggas [?]
My trap house jumpin' like Kobe
Straight octane I'm rolling
Pull up on skates I ain't go on no dates just [?] like I'm bowling
Piped up piped up
Young rich nigga too piped up
Pull up in a brand new foreign
Takin' off and you niggas Jeff Gordon
I'm turnt up in that [?]
You still wearing Ralph Lauren
Woo, I'm rich

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
We too turnt up in this hoe
We too piped up in this bitch but we stay piped up
Said we dun brought the [?]
I designer all my clothes
Give a fuck about a bitch don't give a fuck about a hoe
We dun brought the [?]
We dun brought the [?]
I'm talk 'bout [?]
