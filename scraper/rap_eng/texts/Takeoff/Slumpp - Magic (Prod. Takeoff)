(Intro)
Ugh , Fuck
My back hurt and shit (Aye) (Ayeeeee)
Yuh , Aye
Gang x7

(Verse 1)
Flick of my wrist and I flick it real nice
I sip dirty sprite ride my dick like a bike
Ya main nigga don’t wanna fight
I’ll pop out in black and I’ll finish his life
I got a big Draco it light up the night
If you not with yo gang bullets fly like a kite
Yuh aye if you not with yo gang bullets fly like a kite
Pull up on you with a stick 30 round loaded I’ll let that shit rip
Can fuck with these bitches these bitches ain’t shit
Don’t talk to hot if you ain’t popping shit
I’m tired of talking I’ll call up my jhits
Shurikins fly in yo hip you get it
Perfect susanoo I’m litt perfect susanoo I’m litt

(Chorus)
Young Nigga Lacking
Pull out the strap we stay packing
This is that Faded Gang Shit yeah what happened
Rob you got bricks and we’ll rob you for fractions
Fuck up some checks and we fuck up some packets
Bitch yes I’m trapping
Came up from nothing thank god that that happened
Balling so hard like I play for the Mavericks
Abracadabra but where is the magic ?
Abracadabra but where is the magic ?
Rob you for bricks and we’ll rob you for fractions
Fuck up some checks and we’ll fuck up some packets
Bitch yes I’m trapping
Came up from nothing thank god that that happened
Balling so hard like I play for the Mavericks
Aye
Balling so hard like I play for the Mavericks

(Verse 2)
Then I pass it to my mans (DRACO)
Cause we got a couple plans
Tryna make a couple bands
In a jet before we land
Robbing the plug in a van
Got a bad bitch from France
Tell that little hoe in advance
Counting them checks with no hands
Chain swang you niggas look mad
Why fight for a bitch when I’m chasing my bag
Sorry not sorry you better glad
Break bread for my niggas you know where we stand
Aye
You better be glad
Break bread for my niggas you know where we stand

(Sasukes Chidori Kouken)

(Final Chrous)
Young nigga lacking
Pull out the strap we stay packing
This is that faded gang shit yeah what happened
Rob you for bricks and we’ll rob you for fractions
Fuck up some checks and we’ll fuck up some packets
Bitch yes I’m trapping
Came up from nothing thank god that that happened
Balling so hard like I play for Mavericks
Abracadabra but where is the magic ?
Rob you for bricks and we’ll rob you for fractions
Fuck up some checks and we’ll fuck up some packets
Bitch yes I’m trapping
Came up from nothing thank god that that happened
Balling so hard like I play for the Mavericks
Abracadabra but where is the magic ? x4 (Yuh x2)
