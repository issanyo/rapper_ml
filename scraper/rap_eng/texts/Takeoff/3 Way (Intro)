Quavo!

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I'm attached to the stacks
Still having big straps
Phone tap running laps cross the map hot trap
50,000 on craps
Plug got that baby powder
These niggas out here sour
80k perform for an hour
Should of played for the Dolphins
Should of played for the Saints
Nigga saying it's a drought
Takeoff still having pints
Still playing with that oil
Still playing with that dope
Might catch me on the nawf
Still chopping it up with Bo
I got bitches out in Florida
Having bitches out in Georgia
New bitch hit my phone said she wanna give me dome
Cutting dope by Georgia dome
High school, no diploma
Remember days on the nawf
Now I'm quarterback a coach
Better watch your approach when you pull up on the 'chos
Yeah my niggas having sticks
Mama didn't raise a bitch
Now your bitch always call my phone for motherfucking snow
Today I just met the plug put him in the figure four (coca)
Old Quavo might just pull up and just kick a door nigga
Free my nigga Westside got 5 to the dope nigga
Free my nigga Kobe got 15 to the net (money)
Now I got some hired shooters with the coolants on the TECs
I don't mean no disrespect but I came for the checks (yea)
They free'd the savage Set
Concerts in Quebec
Put her on the grits
Young nigga hitting them licks
No Label 3
Independent signed for bricks

Catching bricks off in the mail (brick)

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Came in the game (aye)
Knock at the door
Nobody answered had to do a kick door (boom)
My niggas they on the same shit (same)
Had to tell em' what that bando was for
I know that we not from Atlanta nigga what you think them two fingers and thumb for (Nawf)
And they been hating on me since I was a lil' boy tell me something I don't know (know)
It's been a long road (long)
I put in work but no cheat code (no)
Pen on paper like kinko
Never look back and won't sell my soul (never look back)
Real niggas never fold (naw)
Say you a hundred but you told (huh)
It's hot outside it ain't cold
Nigga seen the Draco and froze (pussy)
Nigga acting bold I'm a fuck around and wipe the pussy nigga nose (wipe)
Strip a nigga out his clothes (strip)
Don't like it then pay what you owe
Bigger backend at the shows (backend)
Spanish for Telemundo (spanish flow)
I got the Act in the bag right now (Act')
But I won't send you a four (nah)
Dope dressed up in saran it look like the pope (pope)
And get smoked from the gas bags it'll make you choke
If you pour up, smoke or snort coke

This No Label not uno not dos
Come from the goats
(Takeoff!)
