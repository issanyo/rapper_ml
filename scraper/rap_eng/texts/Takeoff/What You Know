[Chorus: T-Pain]
She give me everything that I want
Everything that I need
And she do everything you don’t know, yes indeed
She made that booty bounce back
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that

[Verse 1: K Camp]
What you little niggas know about that
Take you out the picture, yeah I can crop that
She gon get to busting every time a nigga cock back
You know we good together like Pain with a top hat
Oh lord, hold up wait a second, let her get it
Make her scream Camp when I hit it
That girl bad, she gon go monkey on the dick
Pussy heating up, no skillet

[Bridge: K Camp]
Watch her go, go, go, go, go
I love the way you make that clap, oh yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
And yes I know, know, know, know, know
She gon do anything for me

[Chorus: T-Pain]
She give me everything that I want
Everything that I need
And she do everything you don’t know, yes indeed
She made that booty bounce back
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that

[Verse 2: Quavo]
What she know bout the trap house?
What you know bout it?
What she know bout whipping chickens?
She don’t know nothing about it
She know that I’m handsome and wealthy
She know that I got proper etiquette
She knowing that if she gon pop it
She gon go shopping down in Beverly
Make a movie in the photo room
Every time we step out, it’s a damn photo shoot
Palm trees out in Malibu
You can do whatever that you want to do
She giving me everything
No Einstein, she got the brain
Don’t fuck with no rachets, don’t fuck with no rats
You niggas is Pinky the brain

[Chorus: T-Pain]
She give me everything that I want
Everything that I need
And she do everything you don’t know, yes indeed
She made that booty bounce back
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that

[Verse 3: Offset]
Pop that pussy like it is a rubber band
She know that I like it on hand stands
They watching the Migos like on demand
I can’t be her man and she understand
She know that I’m rich and I’ll treat her like shit
And I switcheroo the clique, I’m giving assists
Speak with a lisp when she suck on the (huh?)
Then I stroke from the back and it’s hurting her
I cannot lie, this bitch is a stallion
From Barbados back up to Los Angeles
Sipping margaritas, smoking on cannabis
Need a wife, lil mama got character
Immaculate, swagger sharper than a dagger
She gonna keep looking, then I’m gon attack her
She said that she really don’t talk to no rappers
I don’t comprehend what you say, I’m a trapper!

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
What you know about taking trips to meet the plug?
Pick up the payola and bring it right back
If I gave you the spatula, to the kitchen
Katrina, call FEMA, show you how to whip it
Pull up in the Bentley, red Forgiato
Poking out, looking like lipstick
Lil mama an angel from heaven
A present wrapped up, lil mama she gifted
Wanna ride faster, just sit in that Bentley
She want some diamonds, go shopping at Tiffany’s
Spikes on the Louboutin, made by Christian
When I look at her I get an epiphany
The way that she walk, the way the bitch talk
I think she the baddest bitch a nigga saw
Leaving from the party, head to the love
Your bitch is down, how I catch her, [?]

[Chorus: T-Pain]
She give me everything that I want
Everything that I need
And she do everything you don’t know, yes indeed
She made that booty bounce back
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that
