[Hook]
Lookin' for diamonds in Tiffany
All of my ex's they missin' me
All of you see through like hennessy
You can not run on my Legacy x4

[Verse 1]
Lookin' for diamonds in Tiffany (flex)
Holding myself in a magazine (whoo)
Runnin' the city like gasoline (gas)
My money long like a limousine (long)
All of these may be my fantasy (yeah)
Chill in the back of my balcony (porch)
Schoolin' like i'm an academy (what?)
Schoolin' like i'm an academy
Talkin' bout money but you don't make sense to me
People that real are the only thing next to me
Flexin' so you getting jealous of me, and tell your baby to stop messaging me (ouu)
Up like a mountain (ouu)
Jump in a fountain (I)
Don't need allowance (my)
Mama the proudest

[Bridge]
I know i know i know that you like me
I know you know that i'm really icy
Come on lets go to my crib girl en light me
This isn't safe, but it might be
I know i know i know that you like me
I know you know that i'm really icy
Come on lets go to my crib girl en light me
This isn't very safe, but it might be

[Verse 2]
Yeah
In a matte black coupe flex then i skrt (skrt skrt)
Put in work work leave my prints up in the dirt (ouu)
Man they feel it (ouu ouu)
I be killin' (ouu ouu)
Never bring in down live up on the ceilin' (ouu ouu)
