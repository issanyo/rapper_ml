[Intro: Young Thug]
Thugger, Thugger
Ah, ah, ah
Free the Guwop, Guwop
Woah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
My ho just bumped my phone and said she want Chanel
My migo came to bless me with a hundred bales
I came up out the scale, I whip that fish and scale
My G say I'm not goin' to jail
My migo bumped my line, he got a hundred bales
My migo bumped my line, he got a hundred bales
My migo bumped my line, he got a hundred bales
Yeah, that's my clientele

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
We set the block, his sister hit me up and told me Takeoff come pick up this bail
Told her to eyeball the work, we don't do no scale
A young nigga been trappin' since twelve
Jump in the 'Vette, nigga runnin' from 12
Diamonds is water, they're wet like a whale
Takin' that Backwood, I fill it with Shell
Gas, my niggas they takin' no L's
I drink on Activis not to be cool
So nigga I do not have nothing to sell
The difference between me and your nigga
See the drip, if they get caught up my niggas won't tell
Born to go get it, mama raised me well
Only get one shot, gotta give 'em hell
I get excited when it's comin' through the mail
Some dark white, some of it be pale

[Verse 2: Quavo]
First time that I seen it, young nigga I really had butterflies
Bought my bitch a bag 'cause she crying
Cut off my side ho, she was lying
I done hit a lick a hundred times
No money, that's a bad day
Pistol P died in Domingo's face
Free Offset, caught another case, goddamn
It seem like every time we're getting to the cake
Life throw a nigga 'nother maze
Sack racing to the money every day
I'm gonna do what I wanna
I'm on the block like Orlando Pace
Hundred thousand in the briefcase
Hundred thousand in my [?] safe

[Chorus: Young Thug]
My ho just bumped my phone and said she want Chanel
My migo came to bless me with a hundred bales
I came up out the scale, I whip that fish and scale
My G say I'm not goin' to jail
My migo bumped my line, he got a hundred bales
My migo bumped my line, he got a hundred bales
My migo bumped my line, he got a hundred bales
Yeah, that's my clientele

[Verse 3: Lil Duke]
They callin' my line, these niggas droppin' dimes
I make bitches form a line, put dick in they spine
Rollie overloaded, can't tell the time
Ain't cuffin' these bitches, hell no they ain't mine
Won't see me with nines and I only fuck dimes
These buster ass niggas ain't havin' no rhyme
Break a whole brick down and put it in the trap
Used to make them caps, I switched it up to rap
Now I'm shining like a lamp
Ahead of these pussy niggas by a lap
I'm walking on this beat like I'm running trap
Your bitch is a freak and her head in my lap
My diamonds so rocky like I'm with A$AP
My ho keep on calling and she want Chanel
Fuck all the fake hugs and dap
They wasn't in the trap and I know that these niggas gon' tell
My migo callin' and he servin' me bales
Got niggas down the road servin' them L's
Poppin' mollies got me high as a shell
I'm in the Maserati, don't got no air
I'm ridin' with Thugger like Santa ride with L
I'm totin' that Uzi, middle fingers up to 12
Never lay down and I"m givin' these pussy niggas hell
Diamonds dancin', can't you tell?

[Chorus: Young Thug]
My ho just bumped my phone and said she want Chanel
My migo came to bless me with a hundred bales
I came up out the scale, I whip that fish and scale
My G say I'm not goin' to jail
My migo bumped my line, he got a hundred bales
My migo bumped my line, he got a hundred bales
My migo bumped my line, he got a hundred bales
Yeah, that's my clientele

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
Migo pull up with them birds and I cop them bitches and I serve them bitches
Then I blow the extras, motherfuck the digits
I was like greeny greeny like a fuckin' cricket
These niggas ballin' out, these niggas fallin' out
These niggas coppin' out
These niggas dancin', motherfucker walkin' out
You play with them yardsticks, you know they chalk you out
You don't need no lawyer 'cause they might swap you out
You never heard of that, you stupid nigga
Man my heart is racing 'cause I'm chasing figures
Leave that strap alone, when you became a killer?
You ain't never shot nothin', clap back at this
Your show gettin' so slow like a motherfuckin' caterpillar
I'm still wearin' water like Baptist niggas
When I spray some shit down don't catch up nigga
My house is big, I gotta map it nigga
Cook that rice, cook that rice
Hypnotize, 'til you hypnotize
I got white girl grits, this ain't no rice
I can get 'em hidden, chain gang for some price

[Chorus: Young Thug]
My ho just bumped my phone and said she want Chanel
My migo came to bless me with a hundred bales
I came up out the scale, I whip that fish and scale
My G say I'm not goin' to jail
My migo bumped my line, he got a hundred bales
My migo bumped my line, he got a hundred bales
My migo bumped my line, he got a hundred bales
Yeah, that's my clientele
