[Intro: egodeath]
Move away, move away, move away
Get out my way, out my way, out my way

[Verse: egodeath]
You don't know me like that, so don't talk
You're the reason that we are how we are
You don't know me like that so don't talk
I just wish that u did, now I'm outlined in chalk
I might wear all my rings for no reason
You've been gone, so what's wrong with me leaving?
I won't lie, I fucked around and let my heart bleed
If I die, you can still hear my heartbeat
Fresh tears, hair ties, singing at the red light
Couldn't let their lies infiltrate your scared mind
You don't love me like that, so I walked
I just hope that you have all the things that you want
You amaze me, you can't change things
I still lose it when i see you, heart racing
I can't change me, call me crazy
In the end I'm just mad you replaced me
I don't wanna wake up to an empty bed
But I'm only on your mind when I'm in your head
We can't change things
We can't change things
I let you kill me when I saw you
Heart breaking
Lately, all my angels shapeshift
Bruises on her face
It's important than I see them but she'd never let me know
I miss all the days you'd say you'd never let me go
Ways you lost control you would never let it show
Never let it show
Why you gotta call me every time I'm doing blow?
It's been harder every day without your pictures on my phone. What u did behind my back, I really hope i never know
You don't love me like that, but your friends do
I might drop another song, hope it ends you
You don't know me like that, I do
But you don't love me like that, do you?
