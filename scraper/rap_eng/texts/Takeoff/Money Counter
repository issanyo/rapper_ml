[Chorus: Quavo]
Migos and dirty say they fingers hurtin'
Migos and dirty say they fingers hurtin'
Bring out that money counter
Bring out that money counter
Money counter count up fives and tens
I got them old hundreds and blue benjamins
Bring out that money counter
Bring out that money counter

[Verse 1: Dirty Dave]
This a whole lot of money
Nothin' but 'em 20s, 50s and 'em 100s
Quavo get the yayo
And some rubber bands, don't forget the scale
Ooooh, trap house jumpin'
Bitch, I thought I told you keep that counter runnin'
Now take that to the stash house
Migo we don't need no friends, we count the cash out

[Chorus: Quavo]
Migos and dirty say they fingers hurtin'
Migos and dirty say they fingers hurtin'
Bring out that money counter
Bring out that money counter
Money counter count up fives and tens
I got them old hundreds and blue benjamins
Bring out that money counter
Bring out that money counter

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I just hit a juug on the money counter
I'm swimmin' in the money man I think I'm drownin'
I drink out a lean fountain in the migo mansion
I got Molly I got white, I got Marilyn Manson
Walk inside the trap and see a trash bag
I don't throw it away it ain't no trash can
Thought I told you I got molly, I'm the sand man (sandman)
No I'm not a drum major I'm the band man

[Chorus: Quavo]
Migos and dirty say they fingers hurtin'
Migos and dirty say they fingers hurtin'
Bring out that money counter
Bring out that money counter
Money counter count up fives and tens
I got them old hundreds and blue benjamins
Bring out that money counter
Bring out that money counter

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Bring out that money counter in the money mansion while my diamonds be dancing
Cookin' and wrappin' that work up from plastic
Shippin' it on the Titanic
Young niggas got the block hot like a dragon
Abracadabra do magic
Skippa the Flippa, no L.A. Clipper
Got a hundred thousand in the Aston
Dirty they whippin' a hurricane
So much water in the pot cause a tidal wave
Trap with that work like I'm [?]
Bando lookin' like a masquerade
Wake up in the morning, spark my OG
Then I blow my smoke off of my balcony
Whippin' and beatin' that pot I hit it with the uppercut, that's a fatality

[Chorus: Quavo]
Migos and dirty say they fingers hurtin'
Bring out that money counter
Bring out that money counter
Money counter count up fives and tens
I got them old hundreds and blue benjamins
Bring out that money counter
Bring out that money counter

[Verse 4: Offset]
We got that money counter
Cookin' that dope like it hamburger helper
Got a K and a 9 no german shephard
Touchdown on the plug
Give back to the hood I never been selfish
Adopting the baby, god father like Melvin
I'm a cash rebel
Trappin' and cappin' tryna' make a livin'
The world is cold, gotta keep a pistol
Dirty game, dirty dollars
More money bring more power
The bigger the risk the more you get rich
You niggas not rich, you niggas counterfeit
I'm juggin' OG and I'm juggin' the bricks
I'm stuck in the trap, I can't go [?]

[Chorus: Quavo]
Migos and dirty say they fingers hurtin'
Bring out that money counter
Bring out that money counter
Money counter count up fives and tens
I got them old hundreds and blue benjamins
Bring out that money counter
Bring out that money counter
