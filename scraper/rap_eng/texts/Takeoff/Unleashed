[Verse 1: Takeoff]
The people they doubted me
Sub-Zero tried to put a freeze on me
Insanity nigga they sleep on me
Plottin' on me from the top widows peak on me
See me but act like they don't, hide n seek on me
Know when it's Christmas they come down your chimney
You know these bitches fuckin' for a fee
No it ain't Halloween but I still trick or treat
When we drop Versace niggas they copy me
Made the stocks go up and we didn't get no profits
Ain't trippin' on no money Donatello got it
Yung Rich Nation clothes the new Versace
Migos in trouble, Migos the topic
Migos go gold don't wanna talk about it
We brought the bando into existence
I should tax everyone of you niggas that rap about it

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
She rolling on the floor Scotty too Hotty
Pull up in Bugattis and my plug is Scottish
Double cup me like I'm Tunechi
Bitch lookin' just like Karrueche
Set that bitch up like I'm Queen Latifboosie
I'm at this point in my life man free Gucci
YRN the label a nigga recruitin'
Spendin' the money make it back recoupin'
Hop out the Phantom watch me like a movie
*Niggas lookin' funny and I advise you not to do it*
No I'm not trippin', I'm clutchin' on my pistol cause I can not wait to use it

[Bridge: Takeoff]
Aye Takeoff look here, I just talked to Rel Money, Rel Money say (?)
Say you Offset remember we can get high
I just see Offset the other say man he said [?]
If I wanna get into it with the honcho all I gotta do is make that situation happen homie

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
I been locked up in the studio twenty four young nigga feelin' like Django
Fuck it my nigga make somethin' out of nothin' you need an example my nigga the bando
I'm 'bout that dollar dollar call me Creflo
You fuck with my people get the People's Elbow
Molly castle lookin' like a marshmallow
Breakin' my wrist gave the pot a falsetto
Graduated from the ghetto
