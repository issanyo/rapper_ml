[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya

Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya (Migos, Ferg)
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya

Who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who
Who dat, who dat, who dat tryna get up in my crew?

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Your bitch been a fan while she hittin' my jack
Another deal with Adidas 'cause I'm feelin' like that
Now, now I just blow the money, got 'em swimmin' in cash
I don't even throw the money, sit the brick on her ass
Your bitch been a fan while she hittin' my jack
Another deal with Adidas 'cause I'm feelin' like that
Now, now I just blow the money, got 'em swimmin' in cash
I don't even throw the money, sit the brick on her ass

[Bridge: A$AP Ferg]
All these bricks and money I been stackin'
All these dollars bustin' through the plastic
1800 got me blastin'
I'ma keep the money comin', keep dancin'
Tonight I fell in love with a stripper
Ferguson can be her last name
Who dat, who dat, who dat on your Insta?
Invite her to my crib, we gettin' nasty

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, yeah
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who
Who dat, who dat, who dat tryna get up in my crew?

[Verse 2: Takeoff & Quavo]
Stars in the ceilin', Wraith top
Who that rich motherfucker named Takeoff?
Bad bitch ass soft, beat her face off
Lawyer Jewish, 'bout that paper, knock that case off
(Quavo) Ice shine bright, one hell of a night (ice)
Once I hit it one time, bet I make her swipe (cash)
Beat the pussy, Ike, Mike Tyson bite (woo)
Early A.M. on the red eye flight
A1 dope, nigga can't forget the steak sauce
Same hoes everywhere I go, Nate Dogg
We run from the red dog, pick up when that bag call
Flew to New York 'bout that thread talk, put on when Ferg call
(Blrrt blrrt!) Hello, what's up? Yeah, it's my brother Ferg
Double park that Bentley (skrrt) on the Harlem curb (brrr)
I can flip a pigeon and a dirty bird (brrr)
Chopper with precision, you better mind your business

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, yeah
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who
Who dat, who dat, who dat tryna get up in my crew?

[Bridge: A$AP Ferg]
All these bricks and money I been stackin'
All dollars bustin' through the plastic
1800 got me blastin'
I'ma keep the money comin', keep dancin'
Tonight I fell in love with a stripper
Ferguson can be her last name
Who dat, who dat, who dat on your Insta?
Invite her to my crib, we gettin' nasty

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, yeah
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who
Who dat, who dat, who dat tryna get up in my crew?
