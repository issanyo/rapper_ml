[Hook: Quavo]
Pots in the pan watch me break the stick (whip whip)
Pull up to the kitchen with that strong arm magic stick
J hit the door, and they callin' me Your Majesty
Hit the highway with 50 bricks and a Spanish bitch
Whippin' a brick
Whippin' a whippin' a brick
Whippin' a brick
Whippin' a brick
Whippin' a whippin' a brick
Whippin' a brick

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Whippin' a brick, whippin' a whippin' a brick
I'm tryna' break the stick
Takin' yo bitch, makin' her cook up a brick
I'm tryna work the bitch
My niggas go crazy for babies
I pull up in drop Mercedes
Got Biggie Versace lens on but naw my eyes ain't lazy
My niggas go crazy for checks
Whippin' I'm makin' her sweat
Young nigga I stay with the Tec
I pull up in Rovers and Jags
My nigga keep mavs just like a cadet
I'm givin' the molly to Hannah Montana
I'm pourin' the lean in my Tropicana
Yo bitch bought me a Panamera
Cause her whip game is so special

[Hook: Quavo]
Pots in the pan watch me break the stick (whip whip)
Pull up to the kitchen with that strong arm magic stick
J hit the door, and they callin' me Your Majesty
Hit the highway with 50 bricks and a Spanish bitch
Whippin' a brick
Whippin' a whippin' a brick (go)
Whippin' a brick (Whip whip)
Whippin' a brick (bricks bricks)
Whippin' a whippin' a brick
Whippin' a brick

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
When I'm in the kitchen I turn to a chemist
My wrist just spinnin' I'm doin' my fitness
The pots and the pans got dope all in 'em
The bitch in the kitchen she washin' them dishes
The birds be flyin', the babies be cryin'
My diamonds they make you go blind
Gianni Gianni Versace Versace Medusa Medusa no lie
Christian Louboutin's, like I done committed a crime
I'm servin' and sellin' and whippin' and wrappin'
My trap house got a lot
Package it, I'm traffickin'
Them bitches they call me Your Majesty
Like 50 and Kim I got the magic stick
You run up it's gon' be a tragedy

[Hook: Quavo]
Pots in the pan watch me break the stick
Pull up to the kitchen with that strong arm magic stick
J hit the door, and they callin' me Your Majesty
Hit the highway with 50 bricks and a Spanish bitch
Whippin' a brick
Whippin' a whippin' a brick
Whippin' a brick
Whippin' a brick
Whippin' a whippin' a brick
Whippin' a brick

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
28 grams, I'm cookin' a zip
Pull up in a white foreign whip
I'm whippin' a brick, slicker than Rick
Got your main bitch on my dick
Nigga she stick to the tip
Lickin' her lips
Goin' so long with the stick
Swingin' I'm hittin' the fence
Gettin' these chips
Really got millions of shit
Y'all niggas thinkin' you rich
[?] my bitch
Give her that package she takin' that shit on a trip
No location on the Instagram, I'm tryna shake the feds
Plus you know I'm fresh to death, I'm tryna wake the dead
Sip on some shit might take a pic with your bitch
When I visit the vip, might be goin' all the way
I'm Mike Vick with this shit
Whippin' up the extras like some eggs in the A.M
Whippin' a brick, clips gon' start hittin, my car gon' keep dippin
Keep talkin' we livin'
