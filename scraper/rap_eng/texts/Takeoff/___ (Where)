[Intro]
$ign, Dolla $ign, Dolla
Oh no, no, no, no, no
Oh, yeah (Cut it up)

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I told her where it's at? Where it's at?
What we doing? Where ya at?
I've been drinking, it's lit as fuck
Pre rolls, no blunts

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Hop in my whip
That bitch go fast as shit
She fine and got ass and tits
She fine and got ass and tits
She keep saying pass that shit
She keep tryna snap my pic
She keep tryna kiss on the lips
Said no cause you not my bitch
Light skin with a body
All white Maserati
Pulled up to the party
Took his bitch and I ain't sorry
Ginger Ale with the yellow dye
That for sure gon' make the panties drop
Cut off khaki with the high socks
Skate highs when it's high tops
Too much Bombay
Can't remember her name
Why these bitches look the same?
Why these niggas sound the same?
I've been up all night
I've been high all day
I just wanna see bae
I'm just tryna find bae

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I told her where it's at? Where it's at?
What we doing? Where ya at?
I've been drinking, it's lit as fuck
Who you with? What ya want?
Where it's at? Where it's at?
What we doing? Where ya at?
I've been drinking, it's lit as fuck
Who you with? What ya want?

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Quavo
Stick 'em up where it's at
I didn't shoot him but he had a heart attack
I've been drinkin', I've been smokin'
Dab on 'em, yeah, we started that
Pop a perky, that's the starter pack
90 babies like a Starter jacket
In the club and I got a ratchet
And you know I'm lovin' all my home ratchets
Ooh, I am the dab daddy
I make a nigga get mad at me
Jangle Leg, bitch, I am not the pappy
I got my karats from a rabbit
I got expensive habits
Your pocket dry like a cactus
I got a paid assassin
I feel like I play with the Mavericks
Never been punk, no Ashton
Your bitch, she suckin' and dabbin'
I got a plug in Cali
He Asian like Enter The Dragon
You think I know Marilyn Manson
Cause I got white girls whippin' Denalis
And she got that dope in her panties
Lil bitty bitch, she better not panic, bitch

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I told her where it's at? Where it's at?
What we doing? Where ya at?
I've been drinking, it's lit as fuck
Who you with? What ya want?
Where it's at? Where it's at?
What we doing? Where ya at?
I've been drinking, it's lit as fuck
Who you with? What ya want?

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
I've been drinkin' so much codeine, no quick sand
A nigga not drownin', I'm sinking
Lobby running with a bitch, ass so fat from the back
Woulda thought she was Pinky
Look at my Balmain's molesting her Twinkie
My favorite is Act and yours is martini
Lookin' like I'm playin' limbo, I'm so far from leanin'
Take a look at my bank account, seem like you dreamin'
I told the bitch "What's up? I don't want to cuddle up"
Alvin and the Chipmunks, I just want to nut
I can't fuck with a bitch if she stuck up (bitch)
Drugs in the cup, when you shoot better cuff
'Bout to take a ride, lil mama so buckle up
Only got love for mama, no bitch I can trust
You fell for the set up, got caught in the lust
You fuckin' your stomach up drinkin' that 'Tuss
I met the plug out in LA, Charlie Sheen
He brought me Yao Ming, took him straight to Gandine
When I was comin' up, I liked Incredible Hulk
Money got the same color as green
Gotta get Benjamins by any means
Fuck what you talking, we air out your scene
Migo Wu-Tang cause we all about CREAM
In my Bentley, two bitches turn into a porno scene
Takeoff

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I told her where it's at? Where it's at?
What we doing? Where ya at?
I've been drinking, it's lit as fuck
Who you with? What ya want?
Where it's at? Where it's at?
What we doing? Where ya at?
I've been drinking, it's lit as fuck
Who you with? What ya want?
