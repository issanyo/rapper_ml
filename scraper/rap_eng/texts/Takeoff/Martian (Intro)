[Intro]
T-minus 90 seconds and counting
Sound suppression water system now being armed for release
We have three main engines ready for ignition
Space shuttle now on internal power
Liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen fill and draining valves are closed
Saw the rocket booster flight data recorders are activated
30 seconds into the flight, Atlanta's almost two miles in altitude
Almost six miles downrange from the Kennedy Space Center already, traveling 500 miles an hour
One minute thirty seconds into the flight, fifteen miles downrange, traveling almost 2000 miles an hour
Three good auxiliary power units, three good fuel cells, three good main engines
Ten seconds away from summit-rocket booster separation
Nine, eight, seven, six, fiveâ€”three, two, one, zero
DJ Durel

[Chorus]
I'm bout to make a deposit (Deposit)
Ridin' 'round smokin' biscotti ('Scotti)
And I got ten different watches (Ice)
Which one I'm gon' wear? I got options (Options)
My diamonds fightin', they boxin' (Heavyweight)
Smokin' on cook' in the cockpit (Cookie)
My bitch is brown like Foxy (Bad)
At the show, they doin' moshpits (Ayy)
34, Charles Barkley (34)
Auto-start it then park it (Park it)
Remember the show at the Barclays (Uh)
No stand up, call me Steve Harvey (No)
Walk with the fire like a sergeant (Pew pew)
Play with the fire like an arson (Brrt)
I heard your music, it's garbage (Try again)
Takeoff, I'm outta here, Marvin (Outta here)

[Verse]
I'm on, he on, we on, she on (We on)
Whippin' the pot and I'm breakin' the wrist (Break)
Two-tone the Patek, I two-tone the Cuban
I two-tone the whip with a two-tone bitch (Two-tone)
Shootin' that static, not likin' my nigga (Brrt)
They havin' you flexin', but can't pay your rent (Damn)
President Rollie and president tints (President)
Kendrick, they ain't on my element
Try to sue me, I bet I win the settlement (Win)
Can't do no dirt with these niggas, gon' tell on me (Dirt)
Big body look like an elephant (Big body)
Wrap up that work and I don't got a L on me (License)
They don't know that it's a bale on me (Work)
So we gon' keep that shit quietly (Shh)
Tell 'em pick your poison wisely (Wise)
All kind of flavors and different sizes, uh (Gas)
Yeah, nigga, that's a hundred, not enough (Uh-uh)
I put a mill' in the truck and they thinkin' my engine was still in the front (An M&M)
We the ones that brought the Culture to niggas (Culture)
Before it was never the front (Was never the front)
Three million made this month (Three mill')
Bitch scorin' all the points (Ball)
Tell me what you net worth like
Say it's somethin' different than it was (Huh?)
You wanna know what my neck worth, right?
I can be the damn plug (Plug)
We done been around the globe, we trendin'
Watch how I load the extension (Watch me)
Captain save a nigga, ho defender
Officer cuffin' the women (I'm watchin')

[Chorus]
I'm bout to make a deposit (Deposit)
Ridin' 'round smokin' biscotti ('Scotti)
And I got ten different watches (Ice)
Which one I'm gon' wear? I got options (Options)
My diamonds fightin', they boxin' (Heavyweight)
Smokin' on cook' in the cockpit (Cookie)
My bitch is brown like Foxy (Bad)
At the show, they doin' moshpits (Ayy)
34, Charles Barkley (34)
Auto-start it then park it (Park it)
Remember the show at the Barclays (Uh)
No stand up, call me Steve Harvey (No)
Walk with the fire like a sergeant (Pew pew)
Play with the fire like an arson (Brrt)
I heard your music, it's garbage (Try again)
Takeoff, I'm outta here, Marvin (Outta here)
