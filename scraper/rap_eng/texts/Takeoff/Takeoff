Takeoff

Verse
You rappers you wanna be thirty three still tryna copy me (Old ass rappers!)
Young rich nigga only 19 and you'd better acknowledge me (I'm only 19!)
Fuck nigga you spitting and rapping like this without Migos consent want apology
The labels keep talking, the critics keep writing and
All because we gettin' currency
I think it’s time for extortion
Or killing you babies, abortion (Kidnap you niggas my Migos will torture you)
Young nigga poppin
With a pocket full of cottage
Woah kemosabe
Choppa aimin at yo noggin aye
But
Hop out the bed
And i'm counting them faces
I jump out the whip and them bitches start fainting
No 20’s or 50’s just benjamin franklin
Block on lock call me kurt angle
And You lookin' real amazin'
I Am Legend perfect picture for an independent lady
Got me thinkin' 'bout what I'ma do to you if you pull up on me you got a nigga waitin' contemplating
She said she not from the city but she been down here for a minute, used to stay in Philly
Wanna ride in the Bentley and take a trip around the city, whatever you wanna do baby I'm with it
Night call, diamonds shine with the lights off
Night brawl I’mma spray like lysol
Thot bitch that ain’t my type nah (nah!)
Bad bitch pipe down for a pipe y'all (pipe!)
I’mma need a kind with no flaw (kind!)
Looking at my diamonds no flaws
Don't do it intruder i buss you medula
This ain't no halloween but i might trick or treat them
Or july 4th em and take is freedom
Aye TAKEOFF
