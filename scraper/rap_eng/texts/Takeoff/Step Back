Takeoff!

[Hook - Lil Juice]
I don't wanna fucking go to school
Swear all this won't matter when we busy making moves
It's like whatever you do
Niggas still gon' hate on you
Like I give a fuck
I'm gon' do what I'm gon' do

[Verse 1 - Lil Juice]
And it's really like that
Bought her some new Louis
And she really like that
Ay, saucin' on you niggas
Carry with the step back
Yea, skrt off with your bitch
Just to see how you react, ohh
You just wanna be the only one
But I'm just busy out here havin' fun
Girl I don't know what to tell you
Imma do me, how bout' you just do you

[Verse 2 - Yung Cheese]
Bitches doin' me
I don't wanna do you
Bitch yo pussy stank
You get passed around the crew
Call me MJ, cause I'm ballin' with the flu
All my bad bitches, yea they comin'
Pass em' through
30 on my wrist
Goyard on my dick
Mumble with that lisp
Hands? You want to mix?
Bitch, you don't really want to fucking try me
Diamonds stay froze, and they really fucking icey
Am I cheating on you?
Who knows bitch?
I really might be
Yeah I took your bitch, but I did that shit politely
Bitch I'm up next
Gucci spend a check, just so I can fucking flex (Fuck me)
