[Intro]
(XPMuzik)
Ay, Migo
Stevie J, woah, uh

[Hook: Quavo + DJ Stevie J]
Too much money? Never heard of that
Too many bitches? Never heard of that
My niggas snitchin'? Never heard of that
Migo gang know you heard of that (gang)
And we at the top cause we deserve that (uh)
Heard you got the work, well where the birds at? (brrrr)
Pull up on your block, I know you heard that (skrrrt)
Lettin' off them shots, I know you heard that (baow)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Young nigga I came from the north I know that you heard of me
My nigga west side, he doin' the five for hittin' them burglaries
I haven't seen ya in a minute, why you wanna serve me?
I know that you snitchin' lieutenant, I know that you heard me
I pop me a perc, I can't feel it
I'm smokin' on cookie, can't feel it
Niggas try to get my benjamins
Cause a nigga still winnin'
I'ma make 'em all witnesses
I'ma go down in Guinness
When Offset got bammed he was innocent
Now he came back we can finish it

[Hook: Quavo + DJ Stevie J]
Too much money? Never heard of that
Too many bitches? Never heard of that

[Verse 2: Offset]
Pour me a four, take a trip on the boat
I taste the cookie when smoke down my throat
These niggas snitchin', they sellin' they soul
My niggas catchin' bodies they on go
I needed it the sack get the gat cock it back
Porsche 911 the hatch in the back
Refrigerator got the Act' in the back
Semi-automatic, rat-tat-tat-tat
Look at me now
I'm gettin' chauffeured around
Sippin' on drank while I lounge
Came from trappin' and sellin' the ounce
When you drop it make that shit count
In the dark my Rolex like a lamp
I never heard of a drought
We get em' in get em' out!

[Hook: Quavo + DJ Stevie J]
Too much money? Never heard of that
Too many bitches? Never heard of that

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Too much money? never heard of that
When you're workin' think it called earned that
I came from nothin' I think I deserve that
Say you a bird keeper? Where your birds at?
Ever since I got a check, never turned back
Ever since 50 wrapped up in the fanny pack
Tellin' on your brother, what they do to that
When I was trappin' my nigga where you was at?
Get money my nigga, not new to that
Drophead on my Phantom don't know where my roof is at
If the police up pull up then my bitch handle that
I put the narcotics in that bitch cootie cat
Told 'em that I was gon' take off, remember that
If that pack ain't lookin right send your money back
And I be runnin' with work like a running back
Dippin' the quarterback like a defensive back

[Hook: Quavo + DJ Stevie J]
Too much money? Never heard of that
Too many bitches? Never heard of that
My niggas snitchin'? Never heard of that
