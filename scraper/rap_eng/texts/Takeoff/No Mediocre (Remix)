[Verse 1: Quavo]
Migos in the building what she came to see
She want to ball she told me she was a fan of me
No mediocre have you ever played a game of strip poker
You too bad I can't have you whipping Toyota Corollas
Spanish lil' mama she call me senor
Vámonos andele she want some more
Fifty bad bitches on my yacht all aboard
I'm swaggin' and Mick Jaggin' [?] sharp like a sword

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Said she want to takeoff and come with me right around my city
We got our feet up sipping margaritas big plate of linguine
She a bad girl like riri but a house wife like Nini
My diamonds is looking like water, vvs is looking like ecstasy
She down to make a porno follow if you take a photo
You could've been at the mansion but I hit that in the condo
She screaming YRN, man that's nothin' but Migos promo
Migos chain three amigos you know that's the Migos logo

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Heard he want to lay it down on Iggy Iggy
Gave it to him twice, now he want a 3, Mike Bibby diva
But I need a bad boy, rest in peace, Whitney
Pardon me but I don’t think none of these bitches fucking with me
Want a billboard bitch? Stop running in place
Heels on me saying gimme 6 inches of space
Courtside while designer frames cover my face
Now everybody in the game wanna get 'em a taste
I’m still Grand Hustle first lady, fuck you pay me
Bet he won't go 12 rounds with the million dollar baby
I can change your life quick, stop playing with me
And if you ain't talking money what you saying to me?

[Hook: T.I.]
All I fuck bad bitches, I don't want no mediocre ho
Don't want no mediocre, I don't want no mediocre, no!
Bad mamcitas, ain't no mediocre ho
Don't want no mediocre, I won't hit no mediocre, yeah
Bad bitch stuntin' on them mediocre hoes
On them mediocre, you stunt on them mediocre, 7
Women with me and ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre

[Verse 4: Offset]
I don't want no mediocre that mean I don't want no local
We can go shop at Rodeo while you bounce on me like pogo
Take trips to Barbados where we can dip off and lay low
Have a convo about peso, stick together like lego
I feeling her tip she giving me mental
I'm beatin' it up no instrumental
She popping it on me like a pimple
I'm trapping the birds she like a criminal
You know we splurge she gave me the word, I bought her a Birkin
She wanted a Bentley not a Suburban
I came here from Africa mama from Persia
She bad making me nervous

[Verse 5: T.I.]
Right hand in the air, I solemnly swear
I never go down if she don’t do her hair, no more
You won’t get no kiss if it’s a bush down there
Girl, I should see nothing but nookie when I look down there
Hey, come get with me, what better to do?
He call and ask how you doin, tell him "Better than you", yeah
I’m kicked back with four pieces like a Kit Kat
Me hiting if you ain’t a dime, just forget that
Pretty face, fat ass, if she don’t have
Have one of these, well, I think I’ll pass
I just handed her the keys to a new drop Jag
When she took it, I took it back
You shoulda asked for a Benz, that’s mediocre
