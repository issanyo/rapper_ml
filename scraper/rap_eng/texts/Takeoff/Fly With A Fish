FLY WITH A FISH

(Chorus)
Hit 'em with the hundred round
Make a nigga split
Young nigga trappin
On da block sellin' nicks
I fly with a fish
I fly with a fish
I fly with a fly with a fish
I fly with a fish
I fly with a fish
I fly with a fly with a fish (2x)

(Quavo)
Hit 'em with a hundred round (BOW)
POW, get down - fuck nigga talkin'bout
Clown don't make no sound -
I'm fuckin' yo bitch
You mad and shit
Young nigga I keep stended(extended) clips
My nigga got whips
My nigga they playin' round with dirty stick
I know that you mad
I know that you hate
Cause you and yo partnas ain't ate (you hungry?)
I pull up at eight, yo bitch is the date
The Audi it come with the skates
I'm good from State to State
You go to that State you might get raped (rape 'em)
Got Ben-jamin Franka-lin Grants and Jacksons
Watches stacked on my Plate!

(Chorus)

(Takeoff)
I'm cookin' Tilapia
My diamonds cold -- Antarctica
I live a magazine article
Bitches like Twitter
These Pictures they always gone follow us
Pull up the street like the Opera
I run da block like the mafia
Sellin' that gas to my rasta
Came from my white boy
I got that salvia
These niggas think that they pourin' up
Drink so sweet I don't need Jolly Ranchers
Tell yo girlfriend you a character
You play so hardcore you Jolly Ranch
Flashin' my diamonds is dancin'
Takin' it straight with the gadget
Pull in my mansion
Hop out I pulled up
I got yo bitch dirty dancing

(Chorus)
