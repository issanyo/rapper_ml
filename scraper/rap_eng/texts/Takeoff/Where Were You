[Verse 3: Offset]
As I remember
You quitted on me you surrendered
You pretender, acting like you was there when I was up in the blender
I'm the number one contender, don't hold grudges because I am a forgiver
You niggas make me have a bad temper, ?) said that offended her
I'm still trying to figure out
Where the fuck you was at when a nigga couldn't get out
I'm rich as a bitch with a smart mouth
Like Martin do Pam, bitch get out
Excuse a nigga if I'm acting rude
You was not there when I had no food
You want to start over I'm not a fool
These bitches not loyal she broke the rules
Trifling bitch I'm not wifing it
Left a nigga when I got indicted
You fucked my partner tryna keep it silent
My diamonds shining like the police sirens
My plug on the boat like a pirate
Pussy niggas they don't like me
Real niggas fuckin' with me
Baby girl you wasn't with me
