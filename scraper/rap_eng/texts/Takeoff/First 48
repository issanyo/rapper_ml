[Verse 2: Takeoff]
What the fuck? Who that is outside?
Pulled in my driveway, it's really late)
They parked in, man I cannot see the tag
But I see a badge, 12, time to shake
Fuck, I rush out my backdoor
Trying to grab all of my cash flow
Jumping these fences don't know where to go
If I get caught, I get down on my knees and repent
But what's a case if they ain't got no evidence

[Verse 3: Offset]
I am no killer but nigga you pushed me
Pussy nigga thought a nigga was rookie, hit me for the cookies
It's okay, I'ma catch a nigga in the alley way(Catch his ass)
Hundred round under the K
Nigga feel my pain
I just caught a case
The police saying they knowing my name
They knowing the fame, and the chains
It's part of the game(it is)
You run in my trap, the chopper going to hit you harder than a train
The witness is who you going to blame
No Damon Wayans, I'm bringing the Major Payne
