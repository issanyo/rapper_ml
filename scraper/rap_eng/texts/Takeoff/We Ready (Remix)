I'm spraying the Glock like confetti
The bullets they humming they let it, my pockets are fat its on lettuce, she said it
Pull up in that Oakland Raider Drop Audi
Then I poof be gone like Houdini driving
Thats the plug, drop the bricks, circumcise 'em
Then I hit the pot with the pile driver

[Hook 2] x2

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Young Rich Nigga, I call the plug, I'm finessing
I'm strapped up with the smith and wesson, I'm taking yo blessings
Smoking a Michael Vick 7, preach to these niggas like reverends
No Jason and Freddy, I keep the Machete
I'm taking a trip to Quebec to go pick up that check
Nigga no UPS but he mail it, right that bitch up and I scale it
Stand on the block and i sale it, selling more dope than them niggas in Belly
The niggas after me, I'm makaveli
She popping the molly, she rollin' like kelly, she sweating
She can't stop touching and talking and feeling on me
All this jewelry on me, it's kinda hard to see
Migo Gang Ent!
