I want you to stay
Never go away from me
Stay forever
But now, now that you're gone
All I can do is pray for you
To be here beside me again
Why did you have to leave me ?
When you said that love will conquer all ?
Why did you have to leave me ?
When you said that dreaming
Was as good as reality
And now I must move on
Try to forget all the memories
Of you near me
But i can't let go of your love
That has taught me
To hold on
I want you to stay never go away from me (away from me)
Stay forever
But now, now that you're gone(you're gone)
All I can do is pray for you
To be here beside me again
Why did you have to leave me ?
When you said that love will conquer all ?
Why did you have to leave me ?
When you said that dreaming (oohh..)
Was as good as reality ohh..
And now I must move one
Trying to forget all the memories
Of you near me
But i can't let go of your love
That has taught me
To hold on (why.....)
Why did you have to leave me ?(why did you hae to leave me)
When you said that love will conquer all ?
Why did you have to leave me ?
When you said that dreaming
Was as good as reality
Why, Why, Why, Why ..
When you said that love, Love will conquer all ?
Why did you have to leave me ?
When you said that dreaming
Was as good as reality
I want you to stay never go away from me
Stay forever
I want to stay but i have to go my way
Oohh ..
