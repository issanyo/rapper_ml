She said I should turn her on like that, like that, like that, like that
Ferocious, I’m hungry, I’m an animal, instincts intact

Ferocious, I’m hungry, I’m an animal, instincts intact

[Verse 1: Takeoff & Malenciiaga]
Pop me a missile (brrt!, ayy)
Take me a picture (flash)
Get right witcha (I'ma get right witcha)
Lit like Christmas (like Christmas)
White like tissue (got that white)
Drank too official (what? drank)
Cut like scissors (huh? cut)
Boy got wisdom (yeah, wisdom)
Fuckin' on vixens (smash)
Whole gang itchin' (itch)
Fuckin' with the wrong one, trippin'
Thirty round extension for the tension (brrt, aye!)
Hundred round drum, listen
Fuck around and end up missin' (brrt, aye!)
Get 'em knocked off for a ticket
Have my young nigga do the sentence
Aw man, whip up the white, Wendy
Pick up the pipe, and she get no penny (nope)
Rockstar livin' life, Lenny
I’m a Young Rich Nigga pulling in a Bentley, yeah!
You can do better, never settle
Keep a Beretta, case of the pressure (brrt)
I tell the plug mail 'em
Which way? Dat way, tell 'em, ayy!

[Verse 2: Malenciiaga]
Ménage à trois, then it’s “au revoir”
I’m more polite, it’s like “bonsoir”
Beat it up, while I pipe her down
Speed it up, this what you wanted now
Hit a nigga quick
Like a hit stick
Lipstick, red
Little booty with the nice tits
Big dick, give it to her quick
While she do the splits
Sucking on my pickle
Can you call a nigga Pickle Rick?
Flow sick, like I got cataracts
Pull up in a matte black Cadillac (skrrt!)
Hit her from the back, like a snapback
I be blowin’ up, like it’s Baghdad
Bad little bitch, better bag that
Hit her from the back, have a heart attack
Devonshiire Drip, yeah I started that
I be killin’ shit, like Tha Carter’s back, yeah!
