[Verse 3: Quavo & Takeoff]
If you wanna, gotta get your mind right (mind right)
Got me thinkin' 'bout lil' mama all night (all night)
We gon' have a good time 'cause it's only right (ayy)
An' we all gon' drink past midnight (drink)
She do whatever she wanna (she do it)
She diggin' my Migo-persona (she dig it)
She wantin' me to meet her momma (momma)
'Cause I'm puttin' it on her every morning (put it on her, Takeoff)
Baby, don't worry 'bout nothin', we gon' be alright (uh-uh)
You been strugglin' the price 'cause you ain't livin' right (no!)
I think it's time to exit and show you the Migo-life (damn)
Willin' to listen, learn, baby, and earn stripes (damn)
Wanna know your personality, get to feelin' you (for real)
No carin' 'bout the Celine, nothin' material (nah)
Walkin' in public, people sneakin' to take a pic' of you (flash)
If I could pick one girl in the world, I would be with you (Takeoff)

[Refrain: Ariana Grande & Quavo]
Baby, don't you know (you know)
