[Intro: Quavo]
Huncho, woo
What time it is? eleven o'clock?
Let's roll

[Chorus: Quavo]
Flyin' autopilot (woo), don't need no stylist (no)
Trappin' while I'm drivin' (trappin'), park it on the island (skrrt)
Stiff arm, Heisman (stiff), singin' birds, Isleys (brrrt)
I didn't graduate, but I know chemistry and science (whip it up)
Park it, park it, park it (skrrt)
Heard that everybody know we workin' (work)
Young nigga still murk it (yeah)
Young nigga whip the birdie (woo)
Ooh watch 'em movin' (ooh)
Ooh, shake 'em out the shoes (shake 'em out the shoes)
Ooh, VVS jewels, GI Jew, nigga what it do? yeah

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Probably think it's outlandish (outlandish)
But my business too fancy (yeah)
Ooh, sweet like candy (sweet)
Yeah, jumpin' off Banshees (go)
TEC with the coolant, can't handle it (TEC)
TEC with the coolant, can't handle it (brrt)
TEC with the coolant, can't handle it (TEC)
Young nigga trap dismantlin' (trap, drip)
That's that secret sauce (secret)
Huncho be's the boss (be's it)
Huncho pissed 'em off (peezed it)
Huncho freezed 'em all (I freezed it)
I bought a bitch that bag (bag)
Told her pull up with no drawers (pull up)
Young nigga from the Nawf (skrrt)
Put in her goddamn mouth, yeah (Nawf, Nawf)
Run in the goddamn house (run in)
Sticks on the motherfuckin' couch (sticks)
Bricks in the wall and the aisle (bricks)
Clean it up, clean it up now (clean it up)
Chopper ring, drumline, Nick Cannon (ring, ring)
Hundred racks in the Gucci fanny (Gucci)
12 behind me in a Pontiac, damn it (skrrt)
Skrrt skrrt skrrt, ram it
Bro sayin', bust 'em, nigga, don't jam it (bust)
Nigga pull up lookin' just like mechanics (hey)
Plug lingo, he talkin' in Spanish (lingo)
Wrap 'em and put 'em through traffic (Migo)
Nigga won't catch me lackin' (won't catch me)
Pull up and catch him in traffic (won't catch me)
Pull up and park it at Magic (skrrt)
Hitman, paid the assassin

[Chorus: Quavo]
Flyin' autopilot (woo), don't need no stylist (no)
Trappin' while I'm drivin' (trappin'), park it on the island (skrrt)
Stiffarm, Heisman (stiff), singin' birds, Isleys (brrrt)
I didn't graduate, but I know chemistry and science (whip it up)
Park it, park it, park it (skrrt)
Heard that everybody know we workin' (work)
Young nigga still murk it (yeah)
Young nigga whip the birdie (woo)
Ooh watch 'em movin' (ooh)
Ooh, shake 'em out the shoes (shake 'em out the shoes)
Ooh, VVS jewels, GI Jew, nigga what it do? yeah

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Ooh, shake him out his shoes
When it come to the gang gang we can't lose (lose)
If it is not 'bout them benjamins then I refuse (to what)
To ever have a conversation (conversate)
Hotboxin', there's no ventaliation (uh-uh)
Sippin' on drank and I snooze (drank)
Prescription is my medication (mines)
Forget all your fears and face it (face it)
Pick up that cup and taste it (mm)
I break the heart on a bitch like I'm breakin' a brick
But later in life she'll thank me (she'll thank me)
Cookin' 'em over the stovetop
Grabbin' that pot, I was anxious (anxious)
I left my sack for them old knots (a lot)
We call 'em old, they ancient (ancient)
They put a warning sign up at my shows
'Cause we the group that's dangerous (dangerous)
I'm a big dog, Bingo
Them niggas my niggas still walkin' 'round stainless (steel)
Don't think just 'cause niggas movin' silent that my niggas won't get violent
Need no stylist for my styling, on the private, autopilot (phew)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Flyin' autopilot (woo), don't need no stylist (no)
Trappin' while I'm drivin' (trappin'), park it on the island (skrrt)
Stiffarm, Heisman (stiff), singin' birds, Isleys (brrrt)

[Verse 3: Offset]
(Offset)
Two tone Patek (Patek), yeah, two tone baddies (baddie)
Five hundred racks in the attic (racks)
Two-two-three, the fifty made of plastic (brrt)
Eating up the drip like cabbage (eat)
Lost his brain when I put him on acid (lost his brain)
You niggas lame, tryna copy my habits (You niggas lame)
The whole gang havin' stains, havin' karats (whole gang)
Birds singin' like Barry (brrt)
Skeletons singin' like Mary (hey)
Say what I say, you a parrot (copy me)
I got riches and don't even wear it (riches)
Take a nigga bitch like a hostage here (come on)
The bitch got excited by the lobster suit (bitch)
We pop the Glock like a rasta do (vrrt, vrrt)
Old niggas call me big dawg and salute (old)
I sneeze, the racks achoo (achoo)
When I peep, I'm quick to buy you (vrrt, vrrt)
Got you sick when I sleep with your boo (ehh)
I could pool to make mils out the booth (M&M's)
I got water, let's take us a cruise (splash splash)
Get the pot then I give 'em the blues (uh)
Your neck is not wet, it is fu (fugazi)
Bitch catch a play in the Uber (bitch)
