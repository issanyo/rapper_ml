HOOK:

I know what I do like
Gotta go & put a 50 on a new site
Gotta go & get the green thats what I do right
Got the team with me go & get a new site
We be going strong until its
hold on wait
I be blowing paper til its
hold on wait
Dog he from Jamaica
and we smoke on dank
we be in a new ride
come get you a new ride baby
it all on me

VERSE:

Aye watch how i just came up like its nothing
thats something
Watch how the team go from nothing to something
Only wanna get to touching
and loving
Gotta have this new ride baby
and stack up all this paper til its roof high baby,
You know them women wrong aint wanna do right baby,
but i been going strong up in this new ride baby,
and I've been tryna stack of course,
I'm always moving on and never back of course,
Nobody put me on i had to stack of course,
and I've been running up like on a track of course,
just relax of course,
While I'm all up in this new ride,
Tell me how you like it on the other side,
Them other women wrong aint wanna do right,
Tell me how you like it on the other side,
