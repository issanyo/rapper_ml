[Intro : Quavo]
I dun ran up the money
In the hood I'm Bill Gates
I dun ran up the money (Go, Go!)

[Hook : Quavo]
I dun ran up the money
In the hood I'm Bill Gates (Billy!)
I dun ran up my money
Bought a chopper for the snake (Snake, Nigga!)
I dun ran up the money
I dun ran up the money
I dun ran up the money
I feel like I'm Bill Gates
I dun ran up the money
I dun ran up the money
I dun ran up the money
I bought a chopper for the snakes

[Verse 1 : Quavo]
Now I wrap my money up
I gotta stay away from dirty bitches and these motherfuckin' snakes
Back then lil' mama actin' funny now I'm gettin' to the money
These hoes suckin' and fuckin' for certain under curtains
Chains goes to my watch
"Skrrr" and the Phantom goes drop
Coming in the lane, tryna kick shit
Dikembe Mutumbo the block
Don't knock to my house
But I got low prices at the bando
Quavo the head Hancho
Got hoes on me like a poncho

[Hook]
I dun ran up the money
In the hood I'm Bill Gates (Billy!)
I dun ran up my money
Bought a chopper for the snake (Snake, Nigga!)
I dun ran up the money
I dun ran up the money
I dun ran up the money
I feel like I'm Bill Gates
I dun ran up the money
I dun ran up the money
I dun ran up the money
I bought a chopper for the snakes

[Verse 2 : Takeoff]
Duckin' and dodgin' the media
Back off Versace, Versace
These niggas keep biting my testes and it's all in the media
Look me up on Wikipedia
Let me up, rockin' the boat like Aaliyah
My bitch she be hanging with killers and gangstas
Damn it that shit Mama Mia
So you ain't keepin' her from a career
I dun ran up the money I feel like Usain Bolt
I finesse the plug with diamonds
I remix the blow with soap (Remix)
Meetin' back up with Carlito to pick up a kilo he put me on Nino
Nino the nigga got rich off a nigga that molly from Argentina

[Hook]
I dun ran up the money
In the hood I'm Bill Gates (Billy!)
I dun ran up my money
Bought a chopper for the snake (Snake, Nigga!)
I dun ran up the money
I dun ran up the money
I dun ran up the money
I feel like I'm Bill Gates
I dun ran up the money
I dun ran up the money

I bought a chopper for the snakes

[Verse 3 : Offset]
Money, money, money, money
Shawty Lo young nigga dunn dunn it
Met the plug, up in London
Nigga run up my nigga we drummin'
Wrappin' a blunt as long as a bungee
Fuckin' your bitch my dick in her stomach
Talkin' 'bout money like Chris Brown; we run it!
Trappin' and cappin' keep bombs like atomic
Broke nigga make me vomit
You don't have food in your stomach
Thinkin' about takin' a young nigga's sack then we leavin' your head like a pumpkin
My niggas workin' just like Perkins
Your niggas they stay on the block
Re-up with the plug, hit the pounds and the rock
And the young niggas they pulled out the Glock

[Hook]
I dun ran up the money
In the hood I'm Bill Gates (Billy!)
I dun ran up my money
Bought a chopper for the snake (Snake, Nigga!)
I dun ran up the money
I dun ran up the money
I dun ran up the money
I feel like I'm Bill Gates
I dun ran up the money
I dun ran up the money
