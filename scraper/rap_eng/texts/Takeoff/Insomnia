[Verse]
Plain Jane cost a fifty (Plain)
Main things in my mentions (Main)
They don't really know the half (Half)
They don't really know the distance
Told 'em that I was gon' make it, they laughed (Laughed)
Didn't believe in my decision (Nope)
I tried to tell 'em, they ain't listen (Nope)
They blind, they can't see the vision
My bitches bad and they pay the tab (She pay the tab)

I been gettin' that paper way back in the day
But this shit gettin' crazy now (Crazy)

They tried to copy the style (Tried it)
Count up the backend
Cash in my hand right now (Money)
I met the plug in England
No Queen Elizabeth, we talkin' 'bout pounds (Pounds)
All of my niggas ain't friendly (Uh, uh)
None of my niggas they smile (Nope)
I'm taking risks, Man vs. Wild

Stars in the ceiling, Wraith, ayy
Big body comin' down (Wraith)
Finna go ape, Bape (Ape)
Hundred bricks came in on crates (Crates)
I'ma take the money on dates (dates)
Fuck you and record it on tape (Tape)

Pour up four 'cause I love the taste (Act)
Say you know who? Huh?

I do not fuck with the squares (Nobody)
Bitches they come out in pairs (Twos)
Let's play a game of Truth or Dare (Truth)
Is it true you won't shoot? (Is it true?)
Touch my chain, boy I dare (Dare you to)
You gon' make it out of where? (Where?)
My niggas ain't playin' fair (Nah)
Young rich niggas, yeah, we rare (Ayy)

[Chorus]
Count up my money and give me them blues (Count it up)
Watch me pipe on you (Pipe up), I'ma go'n bust my move
Fuckin' her friends by the two (Two), I been approved

I been up, huh (Up), hey, ayy
We been up up (Up), ayy, ayy
I been up, huh (Up), ayy, ayy
