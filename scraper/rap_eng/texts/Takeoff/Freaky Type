[ Pre-Hook ]
Babygirl coming home
Knowing what to do
She all over me like what she's gonna do
I’m feeling her hand on my chest
I know for a fact that we gonna be the best
Trick or treat, playing hide and seek

[ Hook ]
Babygirl coming home
She got a freaky side
She's my type
She's gonna be my ride
I know that we don’t have to lie
Put you, put you in the mood
Asking if we good
Asking if we good
Put you, put you in the mood
She's my type, yea

[ Verse 1 ]
She's my type
She got a freaky side
Let me tell you how we supposed to be
Wanna go in the mood
Waking up in the morning
Seeing you happy and knowing we can't say our sorry
Ima tell you who you gotta worry about
I'm not doing this for the clout, yea
Babygirl your my type
You got a freaky side
Your my ride
I don't wanna lie
I don't wanna die
Let me go insane
Telling me don't act crazy
Wanna be lazy
Wanna see my baby, yea
Babygirl your fine
Babygirl your mine
Sleeping together if we a married couple
Doing crazy moves in the bed
Let me tell you what we can do instead
Ima tell you what you can see
Kissing your neck, getting you in the mood
I know that was feeling good, yea
Babygirl coming home
Wanna be in the mood
Feeling so good
Feeling so good
Wanna be in the mood
Feeling so good
Feeling so good

[ Verse 2 ]
Living my life with you is the best
I always gotta deal with all the hate
Everyone trying to be us
You know they can't hesitate
Babygirl you showing
Babygirl you flowing
Babygirl knows how to put a show, yea
Let’s go on a date
Knowing that it's late
Sliding to my crib
Kissing your neck, getting freaky in the bed
I don't wanna be dead, I wanna stay with you instead
I don't wanna be dead, I wanna stay with you instead
Babygirl your fine
Babygirl your mine
Going to the movies, holding you
Feeling you, never letting go
Put my genie to the side
Knowing she's my type
She got a freaky side
The one I was wishing for
Babygirl coming home
Wanna be in the mood
Feeling so good
Feeling so good
Wanna be in the mood
Feeling so good
