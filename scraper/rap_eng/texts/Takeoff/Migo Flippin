[Intro: Takeoff]
Yeah
Migoooo
Flippin

[Hook: Takeoff & Skippa Da Flippa]
They wanna know why we called Migos not Latinos
Cause we get them cross the border when we need those
10 pints so you gotta know we sippin'
No hand to hand transactions you know Migo Flippa flippin' (Flippa flippin')
Migo Flippin'
Migo Flippin'
Migo Flippin'
Migo Flippin'
It’s safe to say that the world dabbin' and we brought the dab to the century
Dabbing in fashion European cut like a nigga from Italy

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
(Takeoff!)
Migos and Flippa we don't do that double cup nigga we triple
Pull up at my mansion we switcharoo strippers
No Malcom in middle the plug is my nigga
Whippin' the Fisker with a dub and a nickel
Why you call him Flippa? Because Flippa be flippin'
30 round 30 racks so that is a 60
Notorious thuggin' like my nigga Biggie
We the ones that brought that dab to the city
I put the dope in your bitch Hello Kitty
I think it's way more than a epidemic, or a tradition, dabbin' is history
All of you niggas that said you invented that dab I got evidence and I got witness
These niggas fake acting like they be thinkin' the most be the niggas that wanna take pictures
Behind the internet taking them pictures with pistols my nigga that shit unofficial
Dabbin' so hard you would think I was crippled
Some of my niggas blood some of be crippin'
Plug get caught said ‘cause nigga set trippin’
Double 07 Takeoff on a mission
Coming up I had to make some decisions
Momma talked to me my daddy weren't with me (momma!)
(Takeoff)

[Verse 2: Skippa Da Flippa]
(Flippa!)
I got my chain from an Egyptian I sip the drank with no prescription
Green on my counter marbles on my floor so that mean I shoot at the kitchen
Bad bitch no citizen
Kylie Jenner Kim Kardashian
Spectacular Flippa's immaculate
Throw a brick to the plug just like an avalanche
The brick like a border i wasted my time a little hittin' that bitch with a chisel
Baby chopper Stuart Little
Let off a hunnid round off at the sprinter
I'm the number one contender
Blue benjis like I'm Bender
Gold like the gold member
Exit this bando you cannot re-enter
Niggas can't move how I groove
Leg kick it in my Margiela shoes
Smoke more cookie than a rasta do
While pouring a four in the Mountain Dew
For all of my trappers, this here is your anthem
Creep through the back you woulda' thought I was camping
Run off on the plug and I ain’t talking dancing
Eat it up eat it up like I'm Charles Manson
