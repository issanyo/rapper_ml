[Hook: Quavo]
We wrappin' em up, mummies
I got a uzi tucked
Flame a nigga for snitching
Flame the nigga for runnin'
Me and my niggas we honest
Me and my niggas we honest
Me and my niggas we honest
Flame a nigga for runnin'
Flame the nigga for flexing
For talking shit to these bitches
Flame the nigga for flexing
Talking shit to these bitches
I got a uzi tucked

[Verse 1: Quavo]
How I'm feeling biyatch
Too many niggas nah you can't ignore

Toes on her heels
What you gon' [?]
Feelin' like Rich Homie with Cease and Alamo
Used to sell keys, keys of amaco

Look at the birds they comin'

[Hook: Quavo]
We wrappin' em up, mummies
I got a uzi tucked
Flame a nigga for snitching
Flame the nigga for [?]
Me and my niggas we honest
Me and my niggas we honest
Me and my niggas we honest
Flame a nigga for snitching
Flame the nigga for flexing
For talking shit to these bitches
Flame the nigga for flexing
Talking shit to these bitches
