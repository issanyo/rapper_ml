[Intro: Dayytona Fox]
I love you so much, and, um, haha, I dedicate this to you
Yeah

[Chorus: Dayytona Fox]
Right now (Right now)
I gotta get close to you baby, right now (Right now)
Tell me what you wanna do, baby, right now
I gotta get close to you, baby, right now (Right now)
Right now

[Interlude: Dayytona Fox]
We gon' (Love)
Continuing (Music, life)
Loving life (Infatuation)
Not giving up (Fears, prosperity)
It’s gonna be okay (Moving forward)
This isn't infatuation (Continuing to go, love)
I know this is real (Love, music, love, loyalty, love)
It has to be (Music, infatuation, love, love)

[Verse 1: Dayytona Fox]
Only me and you tonight, girl, we're alone
Love the way your voice sound on the telephone
Hate the way you far away when you at home
You should be with me right now, ah, ah

[Chorus: Dayytona Fox & Takeoff]
Right now (Right now)
I gotta get close to you, baby, right now (Right now)
Tell me what you wanna do, baby, right now
I gotta get close to you, baby, right now (Right now)
Right now
Right now (Right now)
I gotta get close to you, baby, right now (Right now)
Tell me what you wanna do, baby, right now
I gotta get close to you, baby, right now (Right now)
Right now (Takeoff)

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
I give you the world, more than diamonds and pearls (World)
I show you more love than that double cup and syrup (Syrup)
Pickin’ up the phone when the vision is a blur
Knowin' that I'm dead wrong, that I gotta call her (Brrt)
Drippin' in the fur, got the Bentley, we can swerve
And the mansion super big, everything his and hers
She don't kick it with the birds, and the iced out Patek on her wrist
It got her lookin' like she wanna go and surf (Ice)
But from the gate I ain't blowin' out the cake
We been goin’ eight rounds straight, now we out of shape
Smokin’ while I contemplate, I'm thinkin’ 'bout the better days
When me and you, we met each other, it would never be the same (never)
Them material things, I don't care about the fame (Nah)
I miss you so much that I went and tatted your name (Tatted)
Let me be your drug, tell me when you feel in pain (Where)
And you can be my stripper baby, no I ain't ashamed
Thinkin’ 'bout when I hit her, no precision, I got aim
Double R, we pullin' up and watch the Rolls all lanes
I need you in my life, I promise that I'll make it right
And by the end of the night I bet your mind gon' change (Wait)
It ain't 'bout the cars, it ain't all 'bout the chains
Lookin' up, up at the stars, take a look what I became (Look at me)
What you want, a Range? What you want, a pinky ring?
I can get you what you name but love don't cost a thing (Cost a thing)

[Chorus: Dayytona Fox]
Right now (Right now)
I gotta get close to you, baby, right now (Right now)
Tell me what you wanna do, baby, right now
I gotta get close to you, baby, right now (Right now)
Right now
Right now (Right now)
I gotta get close to you, baby, right now (Right now)
Tell me what you wanna do, baby, right now
I gotta get close to you, baby, right now (Right now)
Right now
