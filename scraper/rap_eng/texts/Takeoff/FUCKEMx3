[Verse 2: Offset]
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em
We don’t love 'em, love 'em, love 'em
I’m a hustler, hustler, hustler
Rolex diamond flooded, flooded
Police they watching, investigation undercover
I would never tell on my brother, I put it on my mother
Pull out the chopper, the chopper eat him like he mustard
Look at me now nigga, money grew up, Rudy Huxtable
Maison Margiela, we mafia like Goodfellas
I got 20 bitches on my schedule, I’m living better
When you go to a Migos show it’s looking like Coachella
When the police ask me questions, actin' like I don’t know better
Fuck a nigga, we don’t give a fuck about a sucker nigga
I got a milly, bought a Bentley, hundred rounds up in my semi
Hit the fuck nigga with a chopper, do you feel me now?
You a bitch nigga, pussy nigga, you need a fucking blouse
Fake goon, cartoon, you a Mickey Mouse
I got your bitch in my condo, I’m 'bout to fuck her now
Take a ride with a G, nigga buckle down
QC fuck nigga, catch 100 rounds

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Fuck em, fuck em, nigga get out my section
Don’t want to see him, I don’t want to touch him
Look at my diamonds, my jeweler from Russia
Walk in the club with fifty chains like I’m Busta
When I say fuck em, migos come and get em
OG Maco and Migos some real niggas
Got 50 pigeons in the Charger
Pull up on the plug make that steal nigga
I'm pitchin' hardball like the Dodgers
I got the Green Bay pack, Aaron Rodgers
Chopper bullet coming, better dodge 'em
In the kitchen, cooking pot like a cobra
I pull out the pistol like Mad Max off Shottas

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Yeah yeah yeah, like OG Maco said, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em (fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em)
You ran off with the work but flexing in the city, stupid motherfucker (stupid motherfucker)
My mama told me I can fuck 'em
But you better not never ever trust 'em (smash)
They say Actavis discontinued, check my cup I’m sipping muddy trouble
Pull up on a nigga at the red light
Hit em with the chopper he a dead motherfucker
You fuck with my money, it’s repercussions
Niggas start running when they see the chopper, a nigga gunning
Killing and itching
I got the bodies, don’t know where to dump em
Wrapping the work like a mummy, finessing the plug for dummies
100K when I be kicking, pimping, dripping in London
When I open up the OG, smell like a bag of the Funyons

[Bridge: OG Maco]
Lot of niggas want to hate on me
What’s the reason, nigga who knows
Say I’m focused on the wrong shit
We just putting up the new dope
