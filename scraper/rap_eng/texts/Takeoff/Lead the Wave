[Chorus]
Lead the wave (Lead)
I'm 'bout to lead the wave (Lead)
Well follow me, lead the wave (Follow me)
Watch how I lead the wave (Lead)
Lead the wave (Lead)
I'm 'bout to lead the wave (Lead)
I studied the map, ain't social
Don't need a navigation or Waze nigga (Nah)
Lead the wave (Lead)

Watch how I lead the wave (Lead)
Follow me, lead the wave (Follow me)

[Verse 1]
Watch how I lead the way (Lead)
I'ma lead at an easy pace (Easy)
Go get that bag, don't fumble it (Go get it)
No Tay-K, we did the race (Go)
Rappers start with all the mumbling (Mumbling)
They needed the easy way (Easy)
I know some niggas that trapping at Cumberland
Serving the J with the greasy face (Hah)
Left, right wrist, hockey puck (Ice)
Two white cups got me stuck (Drank)
Donald Duck, chopped and screwed (Up)
But not Scrooge the McDuck (Duck)
Like the Brinks truck (Brinks)
I'm a brand new walkin' million bucks (Uh uh)
I'm confused, I'm on snooze (Snooze)
I'm like, "What the fuck is up?" (Up)
I need the bag, my nigga we up (Up)
All of this gold, they say that this luck (Luck)
Ain't talkin' a feather, your hoe get plucked (Uh)
When she saw the Tesla, doors went up (Uh)
I'm tryna teachin' them how to get money
Don't be around niggas who less than a hundred (Nah)
You talkin' a bill, I'm talking 'bout thousands
Difference of who won and who got the money (Yes sir)

[Chorus]
Lead the wave (Lead)
I'm 'bout to lead the wave (Lead)
Well follow me, lead the wave (Follow me)
Watch how I lead the wave (Lead)
Lead the wave (Lead)
I'm 'bout to lead the wave (Lead)
I studied the map, ain't social
Don't need a navigation or Waze nigga (Nah)
Lead the wave (Lead)
I'm 'bout to lead the wave (Lead)
Watch how I lead the wave (Lead)
Follow me, lead the wave (Follow me)
I go through the days (Days)
I go through the phase (Phase)
Wanna know how to get paid (How?)
Watch how I lead the wave (Lead)

[Verse 2]
Don't fuck with them niggas, them boys be nameless (Um)
I'm talkin' 'bout y'all, don't fuck with the gang 'cause nigga we dangerous (Gang gang)
In the back of the Wraith and I got the top off
She suckin' me brainless (Suckin' me, suckin' me, suckin' me)
You can't put a nigga on if you're too famous (Too famous)
Or give advice and say what's right, then get too angry (Argh)
Tryna read my right, with the red blue light like we still in slavery (Whoop whoop)
Plug got jammed up so the bando dried up, lookin' like raisins (Dry)
Another day, we tryna get by
We goin' through phases (Tryna get by)
Pull up in whips they saw in they dreams
Man look at they faces (Skrt, skrt)
I stopped and got fast food for my teacher
He said I wouldn't make it (Hi)
But ain't got no bad heart
So I saw him, said, "Congratulations" (Bye)
Why do what he want me to do
When I'm in the position, I made it (Now why would I do that?)
I'm from the Nawf, smoked so much cookie in LA
Feel like I got traded (Feel like I'm traded)
I'm goin' through phases
Only want bands, they calling me braces (Calling me braces)
Wanna learn? Gotta have patience

[Chorus]
Lead the wave (Lead)
I'm 'bout to lead the wave (Lead)
Well follow me, lead the wave (Follow me)
Watch how I lead the wave (Lead)
Lead the wave (Lead)
I'm 'bout to lead the wave (Lead)
I studied the map, ain't social
Don't need a navigation or Waze nigga (Nah)
Lead the wave (Lead)
I'm 'bout to lead the wave (Lead)
Watch how I lead the wave (Lead)
Follow me, lead the wave (Follow me)
I go through the days (Days)
I go through the phase (Phase)
Wanna know how to get paid (How?)
Watch how I lead the wave (Lead)
