[Verse 1: Quavo]
I don't know why the lord save me
I had to get rid of them babies
I'm at the top, I'm on Uranus
Versace my neck and my pinky
My momma she told me I made it, Im tired of my family slavin
Daddy was a hospital patient, next thing you know he couldn't make it
I put my head down I ain't cry, cuz then I ain't know what death mean
Then a when a nigga growed up I ain't have my daddy on the scene
So a nigga had to lend to his momma, So a nigga had to go chase commas
Use to eat dollar menu at mcdonalds, now I'm eating big plates at
Benihanas, gone

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Que]
Its first thang I do when I wake up
I'm thanking the lord stay prayed up
Its hard out here for a young nigga
If you ain't got heart you get ate up
Just tryin to maintain and stay out that cell without breakin the law
But its hard as hell, the man above for showing me love
Im taking them trips to Beverly Hills, runnin through hoes
And counting them M's, living life high like Invader Zim
Live for today and pray for the next, I only see money
G's on my specs, I sin everday just to get this success
I want it for me, yall want it to flex
The difference between us its clear as it gets
Niggas be fake so I show no respect

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
I don't know why the lord save me
All the time I disobey him
You would think I would be in dem cages
So every day I wake and thank him
From kickin dem doors sellin them babies
To walkin through Jeff for a price of a baby
I swear its a blessing I never regret it
This shit gets so hectic a nigga start stressing
The kush ain't helpin', lookin' at my Smith & Wesson
Looking for them vegetarians I'm taking yo lettuce and celery
I'm posted on sunset in Beverly Hills my niggas they do this for real
I'm drinking the Act out the seal got niggas waiting for they appeal

[Hook]
