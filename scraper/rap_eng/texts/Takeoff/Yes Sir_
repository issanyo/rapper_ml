Lyrics from various snippets

[Hook: Quavo]
Yes sir! (Yes sir!)
Pull up and park on the curb
Yes sir! (Yes sir!)
Yo' bitch wanna fuck and she slurp
Yes sir! (Yes sir!)
Droppin' a four of that syrup
Yes sir! (Yes sir!)
Give me them bricks, them birds

[Verse 1: Takeoff]

[Hook: Quavo]
Yes sir! (Yes sir!)
Pull up and park on the curb
Yes sir! (Yes sir!)
Yo' bitch wanna fuck and she slurp
Yes sir! (Yes sir!)
Droppin' a four of that syrup
Yes sir! (Yes sir!)
Give me them bricks, them birds
[Verse 2: Quavo]
Rose gold nigga thats [?] (Yes sir!)
I pulled up with a baseball bat
Like a nigga played with the Dodgers (Yes sir!)
Shoot a nigga like Mad Max
Like a nigga played in the shadows (Mad Max)
Flexin' my jesus piece

[Hook: Quavo]
Yes sir! (Yes sir!)
Pull up and park on the curb
Yes sir! (Yes sir!)
Yo' bitch wanna fuck and she slurp
Yes sir! (Yes sir!)
Droppin' a four of that syrup
Yes sir! (Yes sir!)
Give me them bricks, them birds
