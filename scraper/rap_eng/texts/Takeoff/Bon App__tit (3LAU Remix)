[Intro: Quavo]
Ay, yeah
Katy Perry, Migos

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appétit, baby

[Post-Chorus: Katy Perry]
Oh na (and it's ok)
Melt in your mouth, boy
And it's ok
Melt in your mouth, boy

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
Under candle light
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appétit, baby
(go ahead)

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
I'm the one they say can change your life (take off)
No waterfall, she drippin' wet, you like my ice? (Blast)
She say she want a Migo night
Now I ask her, "What's the price?" (Hold on)
If she do right, told her get whatever you like
Offset

[Verse 5: Offset]
I grab her legs and now divide, aight
Make her do a donut when she ride, aight
Looking at the eyes of a dime, make you blind
In her spine and my diamonds change the climate

[Verse 6: Quavo & Katy Perry]
Sweet tooth, no tooth fairy
Whipped cream, no dairy
Got her hot light on, screaming, "I'm ready"
But no horses, no carriage

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry & (Migos)]
Ahh ahh, (ay)
Ahh ahh, (ya)
Katy Perry (ey)
Migos

[Chorus: Katy Perry & Quavo]
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy (all that you want)
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby (bon appétit)
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven (fresh out the oven)
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon appétit, baby
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby (bon appétit)
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appétit, baby
Quavo

[Post-Chorus: Katy Perry]
Oh na (and it's ok)
Melt in your mouth, boy
And it's ok
Melt in your mouth, boy

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appétit, baby

Bon appétit, baby
