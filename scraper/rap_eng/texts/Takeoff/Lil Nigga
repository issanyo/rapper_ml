Lil nigga keep starin' at my wrist

Got a sister she a twin and her mom drive a sudan
Lil nigga so mad cause he bitch on my command
Took a trip put on grits and when she left she was on Xans
Make that bitch pick up a bag, met the plug in Baghdad
She did all my dirty work and I didn't give that bitch no cash

Once upon a time young nigga was a lil nigga
Then I trapped out the bando with the gang members
Then I stood on the block with the drug dealers
Pistol P got shot by some fuck niggas
Everyday every night lookin' for the killer
Won't stop till I find him like Godzilla
In the field with the stick like a grave digger
Run off from the plug get paid quicker
Foreign bitch if she bad all I do is hit her
You the type of lil nigga to get married with her
Ask Mango foo nigga all we do is hit her
Stuffed crust backwoods we don't do the Swishers
30 deep in the club we don't take pictures
2 guns on my waist which one bigger
I'm from the north so I throw it up lil nigga
Lil nigga
Lil nigga
