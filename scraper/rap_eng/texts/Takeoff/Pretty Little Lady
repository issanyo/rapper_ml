[Hook: Quavo]
Pretty lil lady, lil lady
I tried to put her on but she already made it
Pretty lil lady, lil lady
And she got her own, she don't need a nigga paper
Little lady, you're so pretty
Pretty lil lady, you're so pretty
Pretty lil lady, and she got her own
Pretty lil lady, you know she got her own

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Pretty lady, she got her own in her Mercedes
And she single, she thick and grown with no babies
I really wanna take little mama home and go crazy
But she won't let me, I can't do nothing but respect it
She go to work from Monday through Thursday she earned it
She don't care about my money, I sip my tea like Kermit
She don't care bout them hunnids she pull 'em out the purses
Lil bitch I'm the dab king I fuck her like a virgin
She say she got a 9-5 I know that bitch serving
It's none of my business I ain't worry
But if you got a nigga and you workin' for him
I'ma shoot that nigga, Quavo Stephen Curry

[Verse 2: Offset]
Handle your business don't put me in it
I know the truth you not innocent
She got excited by my Louboutins
Hop in my Lambo fuck her, we don't speak again
She didn't know I was a rapper
Pick up the front and back in every weekend
Gotta tell the truth shawty be dabbin'
Pull up on you in the jagger with Aston
Her stomach so flat like she fastin'
Look at that ass it's fantastic
Go get that money lil bitty bitch (go get it)
Now hop on that pole and get nasty
She won't let you smash unless you spendin' it
It gotta be some type of benefit
Well fuck it I don't really need that bitch
She a bad bitch, she ain't really shit
I beat it, I hit her but I can not keep her
We at the condo she smokin' the reefer
Some of you lie she a beater
Nasty and know little mama in the fetal
Balenciega, alligator sneakers
I trapped on the block, hotter than a fever
I know she workin' she is not a keeper
She fuckin' all these niggas with monifa

Pretty lil lady, lil lady
I tried to put her on but she already made it

And she got her own, she don't need a nigga paper
Little lady, you're so pretty
Pretty lil lady, you're so pretty
Pretty lil lady and she got her own
Pretty lil lady you know she got her own

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Takeoff!
I know little mama she got it, no doubt about it
But I'm trying to see bout it
Pulling Benjamin's out her wallet
Looking real exotic, walking in Zanotti (Damn!)
Big booty so big it's shaped, look like an apple (Ooh!)
She bending over bouta make me get tackled
Wanna go to [?] let her see the castle
Grab 'bout 28 folds you gon' need a ladder (Ooh!)
We smoking up cookies burning like a candle (Gas!)
Asked her where she's from she told me Seattle
Mama live in California, said her brother doing 5 years in Savannah
Got a condo down in Alabama
She gon' let me pull up be my nasty dancer (Beat it!)
TV's in my phantom can change the channels (Flex)
Lookin' up to the sky cause its panoramic
I fuck with her pimpin' cause she really getting it (fuck with ya)
No Felicia, lil mama run up a ticket (Add it up)
Dabbin might pull up on you in Givenchy (Damn!)
Pretty lil lady, know she independent
You beat the statistics you got you a car and a house
So I can't take you out of the trenches, (Nah!)
Ain't gotta add me for none of my benji's
You 'bout ya riches and you mind your business
Takeoff!
