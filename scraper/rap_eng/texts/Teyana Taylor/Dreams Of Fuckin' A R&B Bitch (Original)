[Intro x2]
I heard that you feelin' Teyana, you say she a fly little mama

[Chorus]
Dreams of fuckin' you an R&B bitch, B bitch
I heard your little bars about my cleavage, dream shit
Don’t waste my time, if you comin' nigga come right
Got a couple niggas on my line
Nigga all I’m tryna say
You know that I hear you boy
Niggas talk that shit all day
Tell me you something different boy
Ooh boy I want different
Boy I want something different
So you better come wit' it
Boy you better come wit' it
Cuz whoever get in it
Is automatically winnin'

[Verse 2]
Dreams of fuckin' you an R&B bitch
This pedestal so high niggas can’t reach it
And yet I hear you runnin' game
You’re not the first to sing my name
Everyone wanted Teyana
A singer, a dancer, designer
I heard you in love with a Harlem
Ass cause it shake when she walkin'
No need to send me no bottle
Nigga I'll pay for my order
Should be accustomed to customs
Have that ass crossin' that border
I’ll have yo ass crossin' that border

[Chorus 2]
Dreams of fuckin' you an R&B…
And I know you got them dreams of fuckin' me
So stop wastin' time
You comin'? Nigga come right
Got a couple niggas on my line
But
Boy you know that I’m taken
Boy you know that I’m taken
I don’t really wanna play again
And I’m gone and I’m taken
Cause you know that I’m taken
I apologize, apologize
That I got ya hype but blow my mind now
Alright, alright…
I apologize but I’m taken
Apologize but I’m taken
