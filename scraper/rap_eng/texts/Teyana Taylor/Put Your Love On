[Verse 1]
Right, baby come and do my body right
I don't care about who's on my line
We should be alone, just you and I
Time, look at how we're losing track of time
That's what happens when you spend the night
You get out my bed, you hold me tight, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, you know that I love it love it when you're in control
I return the favor to you, nice and slow
You know how we do
Baby, my love is on you
I love how you adore me, you deserve it all, baby
I love how you adore me, you deserve it all, baby

[Chorus]
Put your love on me, put your love on
Put your love on me, yeah I love you some
Put your love on me, put your love on
Put your love on me, boy I love you some, you

[Verse 2]
So right, baby don't forget to hit the lights
So right, baby don't forget to hit the lights
Creeping through the back door
I see you every morning
Put the rock on, shining bright
Give me more

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, you know that I love it love it when you're in control
I return the favor to you, nice and slow
You know how we do
Baby, my love is on you
I love how you adore me, you deserve it all, baby
I love how you adore me, you deserve it all, baby

[Chorus]
Put your love on me, put your love on
Put your love on me, yeah I love you some
Put your love on me, put your love on
Put your love on me, boy I love you some, you
