[Verse 1]
Over and over again
I meet different guys who would play a part
But I need a homie, a lover, a friend
Somebody that's true and won't break my heart
Baby, oh maybe, I'll get a chance to see you, a chance to meet you
Oh baby, oh lately, it's been kind of lonely tell me where you are

[Chorus 1]
I gotta know, I wanna know
Where you are, baby I won't give up until I'm yours
You need to be right here with me
I just wanna find my mystery lover, I gotta find you
Baby, please tell me where you are
I need to see you, I gotta meet you
I need to be right where you are
Mystery lover

[Verse 2]
Too much time has passed by
Still so alone, here on my own
I need your mystery love
I need your heart and I wanna touch ya
Baby, oh maybe, I'll get a chance to see you, a chance to meet you
Oh baby, oh lately, been kinda lonely tell me where you are

[Chorus 1]
I gotta know, I wanna know
Where you are, baby I won't give up until I'm yours
You need to be right here with me
I just wanna find my mystery lover, I gotta find you
Baby, please tell me where you are
I need to see you, I gotta meet you
I need to be right where you are
Mystery lover

[Bridge]
Is he a stranger, is he a friend?
Is he a star or a regular man?
Could he be this person, that's been here in front of me this whole time?

[Chorus 2]
Mystery lover, I gotta find you
Baby, please tell me where you are
I need to see you, I gotta meet you
I need to be right where you are
Mystery lover, I gotta find you
Baby, please tell me where you are
I need to see you, I gotta meet you
I need to be right where you are
Mystery lover
