Everytime I see you I can't think what to say
Cause you got me blushing when you pass my way
Everytime I see you I can't think what to say
Cause You got me blushing when you pass my way
Everytime I see you I can't think what to say
Cause you got me blushing when you pass my way
My friends say I'm fronting
Cause I don't want to speak to you
But I know that's not true

[Chorus]
Cause I-really got it bad for you baby
Boy you know I got it bad
Cause all I do is think about you baby
Cause I think about you yeah
I know I might sound confused baby
I'm feeling so confused yeah
And all I really want is you baby
I just want you to know-when you're not here
When you're not here baby-all I do I think of you
All I do all I do is think of you
When I'm alone all I do is think of you

So another day passes by and I still haven't told you
How I feel-cause them chicks be in your face
All them other girls may sweat your style
But thats not how I get down
So I'll wait for you to come around
Really got it bad for you baby
I really got it bad yeah
Cause all I do is think about you baby
I think about you baby
I know I might sound confused baby, confused yeah
But all I really want is you baby
All i really want is you
When you're not here all I do is think of you
When I'm alone all I do is think of you

[Reprise:]
Time after time I try to tell myself why
Can't I jus talk to you and get it over with
My pride is just so high and I get so shy around you
And I don't know what to do
Really got it bad for you baby
Cause all I do is think about you baby
I need to tell you tell you how I feel
I know I might sound confused baby
Confused but all I really want is you baby
I'm so into you when you're not here
All i do is think of you
When I'm alone all i do
Is think of you, of you, of you
