[Hook - Teyana Taylor]
Last call in the club
Now we speeding to the after-party
It's time to live it up
No hate, celebrate, we all gonna party tonight

[Verse 1 - Jim Jones]
Full speed, no slowing down
I told her "drink up" then blow it down
Stay loaded up when we roll around
So as I'm pulling up, your girl going down
? life, all vamped up
My passport pages all stamped up
Bitches in the back all cramped up
All we need is by the pool, get tanked up
I got the juice: Tropicana
Brand new goo: drop banana
Bluetooth and I got a scanner
And a Samsung ? since I got a hammer

I drink, get drunk
And when my cup it on E I fill up
Up top, mo shots, stay poured up you know it don't stop
Pour it up!

It's time to live it up

[Verse 2]
We living life fast, full steam ahead
Shipping shots of Ciroc, flavor berry red
And that cranberry drop, yeah it's very red
We gon celebrate life til a nigga dead
Swagged up and you know what's going down
Polo from head to toe, I don't really horse around
Find a bad chick in the valet, bring the Porsche around
Mama, I'mma probably forget your name if you don't jot it down..
New rocks, how the face look?
I heard the chick look better on Facebook
You got a funny lifestyle like Dave Cook
And I'm kinda ? you can get your chains took

I drink, get drunk
And when my cup it on E I fill up
Up top, mo shots, stay poured up you know it don't stop
Pour it up!

[Verse 3 - Cam'ron]
AK, ? mask that ?
Thousand rounds, who stop us? No one can
Full-length stretch, rolling up more dank
Swim this shit like a fish bitch: ocean
No redemption, but I got my shawshank
9-tec, masked models, hoodrats who are skanks
Fuck with me, show you where the bottom is
One back of your dome, homes, ride or miss
Out your element, make you irrelevant
Hood nigga, true Wu, defined with elegance
Like this? You buying, I'm selling it
I'm a giant in the climate, stay elephant
