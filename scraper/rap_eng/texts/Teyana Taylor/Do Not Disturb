[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
So I got this feeling
You and I need a moment
I want you to love me, babe, make me know it
I need you to want me, babe, come and show it

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Let me satisfy you tonight
Go inside, sit on my couch, oh
I know what you like, just sit back
Let me ride, hear it all out, uh

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Chris Brown]
I want you right now
Not another minute later, so come on
Put your money where your mouth is
Give you what you paid for, come on
I know it's real, how my body feels on yours, oh
And I want to spend some time
"No Entrance" sign on the door, oh, no
Please don't disturb me, no, don't disturb, no

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
So I got this feeling
That you and I need this moment
I want you to touch me, baby, let me feel it (right there, right there, yeah)
I need you to hold me, baby, if you willing (hold me now)

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Chris Brown]
Let me satisfy you tonight
Go inside sit on my couch, oh
I know what you like, just sit back
Let me ride, hear it all out, uh

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Chris Brown]
Baby, I, I want you right now
Not another minute later, hey, so come on
Put your money where your mouth is
Give you what you paid for, come on
I know it's real, how my body feels on yours, oh
And I want to spend some time
"No Entrance" sign on the door, oh, no
Please don't disturb me, no, don't disturb, no

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & Teyana Taylor]
Like a copper I'm cuffing, I'm copping a feel
Little mama got ass when she walk in them heels
She love when I eat it, she making a meal
Baby girl screaming, I give her the pillow so no one could hear
Oh, he biting my neck while my legs in the air
Tell me you love me then pull on my hair
I like it rough, don't be gentle, my nigga
It ain't rocket science, it's simple, my nigga

[Outro: Teyana Taylor]
Oh no, please don't disturb me, no, don't, disturb no
Please don't disturb
