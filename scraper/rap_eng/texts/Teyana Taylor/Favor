[Verse 1: Lonny Bereal]
Girl, relax, I got your back
I never seen you put kg in the air like that
I nibble a lil' bit on your thigh
I'll tell you what kind of girl you remind me of, my dream
All night, let the neighbors hear you beep
Girl, when it's just you and me, I'ma put that ass to sleep

[Pre-Chorus: Lonny Bereal]
Scratch my back, bite your neck
Welcome to the world of having sex
Pick you up, pin you down
Then we gon' go another round, baby
Oh, and we can do this all night
Take flight on cloud nine

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Teyana Taylor]
Take you there
Let me be your stairs
Just put your legs in the air
I want you to sit right there
I'ma be your chair
And I’m gon' rock your body slowly
Do it like I owe you a
Favor, like a owe ya
Favor, like owe ya
Favor, like a owe ya
And I’m gon' rock your body slowly
Do it like I owe you a

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
It's amazing how faded, I done got tonight, baby
I’m crazy, love making, all the new spots that I've found
Banging on the bed, bum, bum, bum, don’t hurt your head, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
Can I just kiss it right, after I wear it out? I want you to

[Pre-Chorus: Lonny Bereal]
I want you to scratch my back, bite your neck
Welcome to the world of having sex
Pick you up, pin you down
Then we gon' go another round, baby
Oh and we can do this all night
Take flight on cloud nine

[Chorus: Lonny Bereal, (Chris Brown) & Teyana Taylor]
Take you there
Let me be your stairs (be your stairs, oh)
Just put your legs in the air
I want you to sit right there (oh, woah)
I'ma be your chair
And I’m gon' rock your body slowly (rock your body slowly)
Do it like I owe you a (owe you a favor)
Favor, like a owe ya (yeah, yeah)
Favor, like owe ya (favor, yeah, yeah)
Favor, like a owe ya
And I’m gon' rock your body slowly
Do it like I owe you a

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
I want you to beg for it
You're fiendin' 'cause you miss me, yeah
Open up your legs more and let me in, I want in
Wrap your arms around just love me
Wrap your legs around just love me
Right here, like that, like that, woah

[Chorus: Lonny Bereal, (Chris Brown) Teyana Taylor]
Take you there
Let me be your stairs (woah)
Just put your legs in the air (in the air)
I want you to sit right there (I don't care, I don't care)
I'ma be your chair
And I’m gon' rock your body slowly
Do it like I owe you a (and I don't give a fuck, girl, baby)
Favor, like a owe ya (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Favor, like owe ya (yeah, yeah)
Favor, like a owe ya (ooh, yeah)
And I’m gon' rock your body slowly (on the bed)
Do it like I owe you a

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Do me a favor
