[Intro Skit]
Teyana, answer the damn phone! I know you probably over there with his stankin' ass. I don't even know why you still love him, he ain't nothin' but a scumbag. Call me back, you trippin'

[Verse 1]
I don't know why I still love you
I know it's not right, but I still want you

[Pre-Chorus]
She don't give you what you need
That's why you run back to me
Can't nobody do the things that I can do
Every time we walk away, things just stay complicated
That's why I ain't asking you to choose

[Chorus]
I know that you belong to her, yet I'm still your lover
We both know this could never work, let's stay undercover
Undercover, under, undercover
Undercover, under, undercover

[Verse 2]
She has no clue about us
If she only knew, then it would be over, then we would be closer

[Pre-Chorus]
She don't give you what you need
That's why you run back to me
Can't nobody do the things that I can do
Every time we walk away, things just stay complicated
That's why I ain't asking you to choose

[Chorus]
I know that you belong to her, yet I'm still your lover
We both know this could never work, let's stay undercover
Undercover, under, undercover
Undercover, under, undercover
