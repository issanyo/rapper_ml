[Verse]
If I tell you, you belong to me
Would you be mine in reality?
And not just in my mind
I'm so tired of being invisible to you
I'm so tired
How could a boy like you ever want a girl like me?
You're way outta my league, way outta my league
'Cause boys like you never want a girl like me
You're way outta my, outta my, outta my league
