[Intro]
Give me your love love, gimme

[Verse 1]
You knock me down, my pride hits the ground
Don't know if this is going away
My heartbeat jumps to the tip of my tongue
I think you're wanting to say come over here

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me your love love, gimme
Give me your love love, gimme
Boy, you don't know what you're doin' to me
Just give me your love love, gimme
Right here, don't care

[Chorus]
It could just be love or something like it
Boy, I don't know
But I need you right now
It could just be love or something like it
I think I like it
And I'll know soon enough

[Verse 2]
I let you in, sweet blissful sin
Questioning if you're worth my religion
My heart skips only to the beat of your drum
I can feel your rhythm calling me, saying

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me your love love, gimme
Give me your love love, gimme (ooh, ahh)
Boy, you don't know what you're doin' to me
Just give me your love love, gimme
Right here, don't care

[Chorus]
It could just be love or something like it
Boy, I don't know (boy, I don't know)
But I need you right now
It could just be love or something like it
I think I like it
But I'll know soon enough

[Verse 3]
Struck down, sure that love is a gun
Shot down, I'm another victim
Coldblood, leaving me here lonely (no)
First thought, was I the only one thinking?
Well, I was right from the beginning
Despite both of our good intentions
Love was a gun to me

[Chorus]
It could just be love or something like it
Boy, I don't know
But I need you right now
It could just be love or something like it
I think I like it
But I'll know soon enough

[Outro]
Give me your love love, gimme
Give me your love love, gimme
Give me your love love, gimme
Give me your love love, gimme
