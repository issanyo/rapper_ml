(Verses 1):
(Topnotch4Real)

Baby you looking like you single like some wifi
Lemme get that window seat by you , cause ima fly guy

But look I feel you like me too, it ain't coincidental
That I found this instrumental, wish a nigga kiss ya dimples
Boo this that real shit

I gotta on my team, ain't no cutting and benching you
Wanna savor your flavor , so
Im sucking and licking you

Boo fuck what them niggas do
Don't fuck with them niggas boo
My dick busting rounds
You can suck on that trigger boo

She don't mind niggas watching

She come home to a known producer , baby

My sex feel 4real, be the next to wet gills
I been blessed with skills
To give chills, whats happening with ya

(Hook):
Teyana Taylor:

Boy , boy You make me feel
Cause when you not around, my whole world

Boy I like you , I hope you like me too
Think of how it could be, if it was you and me
Baby don't you know that

(repeat 2x)

(verse 2):
(Teyana Taylor)

The things you make me do, you make me so crazy
The thought of loosing you
Makes me feel incomplete

Boy you ya know you make me weak
Theres no more words to speak
Baby won't you come wit me
And let, let it be you and me

(Hook):

Boy , boy You make me feel
Cause when you not around, my whole world
Comes down

Boy I like you , I hope you like me too
Think of how it could be, if it was you and me
Baby don't you know that

(repeat 2x)
