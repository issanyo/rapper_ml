[Hook: Teyana Taylor]
I know you thought I wouldn't shine like this
They know I took my time with the shit
Diamonds on my neck, I blind them with the wrist
Hey, it feels good when you make it from nothing
I grind like this
So I can shine like this
Them diamonds on my wrist
It feels good when you make it from nothing

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, North Philly in my bloodstream, nigga
South Philly from my dad genes, nigga
I could wear my dad jeans
Bought my mom and sister a new crib when that cash came
Nigga, put some respect up on my last name
No better feelin' than seeing my cousin serve his last fiend
No better feelin' seein' lil Papi talkin French to me
All this money, these pussies will never get to me
Why you think you never hear 'bout what they did to me?
Hunnid bands, quarter milli, talking big money
I'm want you dead and nobody stopping shit, homie
Cause honestly we give a fuck about your big homie
Fuck it, posted in the jungle with a ladder
How can they compare me to a rapper?
Did it for attention 'cause he had to
Niggas broke, their opinions never mattered
Fuck 'em!

[Pre-Hook: Teyana Taylor]
Damn, it feels good from way up here
Damn, it feels good, baby
Yeah, from way up here

[Hook: Teyana Taylor]
I know you thought I wouldn't shine like this
They know I took my time with the shit
Diamonds on my neck, I'm blogging with the wrist
Hey, it feels good when you make it from nothin'
I grind like this
So I can shine like this
Them diamonds on my wrist
It feels good when you make it from nothin'

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Dreamchasers, accomplishments are remarkable
Big fish, little fish
I always need a prayer before we do the toast
My circle competitive, let's see who move the most
I gave my niggas game before they knew the ropes
Now let's talk about numbers, I really do 'em both
I still got two real uncles who still be doing dope
One of them used to run with a fluky stokes
So many new faces sometimes I do get ghosts
Still one call away from ones who really knew me most
Staying in my lane out of the uzi smoke
You only beating cases based on who you know
Public defender gave him a funeral
Juvenile sent to Rikers, he never knew the rules
Assesin' religions, he donâ€™t know who to choose
Let's bow our head over these Ramen noodles
God is the greatest and I pray for peace
Still rolling up that leaf, Mr. Drew Ali, I salute you

[Pre-Hook: Teyana Taylor]
Damn, it feels good from way up here
Damn, it feels good, baby
Yeah, from way up here

[Outro: Teyana Taylor]
I just want the money, baby, yeah yeah yeah, hey
What they want from me, baby? Yeah yeah yeah, whoa
And we still want it, baby
Money is coming, we still run dough
Niggas run up but we never lay low
Niggas kept it real so we never lay low, never lay low
Run through the money, going way up
Money on the wheels go way up
The doors on the coupe go way up
It's so easy to hate us
Niggas in the club spilling Aces of Spades
Popping on the bub' and they love a check
Niggas going somewhere, I'ma make it
If you ain't got my money, I'ma take that
They probably thought a nigga wouldn't shine like this
Got deals so I signed like this
Diamonds on my neck, I blind them with the wrist
Hey, yeah
I'ma change my mind on you
You know how we do
I'm eating lobster on a plate now
