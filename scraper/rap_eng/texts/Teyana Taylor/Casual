[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
She said she really wasn't looking for love
Just somebody that could show her a good time
We agreed and promised that would be us, be us
Sometimes we would meet up after the club
If we did it, everything would be alright
Those were the days, oh how things changed, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
'Cause now you be tryna shop for rings, worried about things
That ain't got shit to do with you
Tell me how did we go from friends to worst enemies?
Shawty, do you remember when we had chemistry?
Now you mad at me, once again, it don't make sense to me
What has got into you?

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
We was supposed to be
Casual, causal, casual lovers
We was supposed to be
Casual, causal, casual lovers, yeah
Those were the days, those were the days, yeah
I don't know why things had to change, yeah

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
In the beginning girl we weren't in a rush
And the last thing on your mind was forever
Now every minute you fall deeper in love, I don't get it, baby
Now you tripping when I go to the club
And if I don't pick up, you'll be calling me all night
I should've know it was too good to be true

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
'Cause now you be tryna shop for rings, worried about things
That ain't got shit to do with you
Tell me how did we go from friends to worst enemies?
Shawty, do you remember when we had chemistry?
Now you mad at me, once again, it don't make sense to me
What has got into you?

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
We was supposed to be
Casual, causal, casual lovers
We was supposed to be
Casual, causal, casual lovers, yeah
Those were the days, those were the days, yeah
I don't know why things had to change, yeah

[Voicemail: Teyana Taylor]

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
We was supposed to be
Casual, causal, casual lovers
We was supposed to be
Casual, causal, casual lovers, yeah
Those were the days, those were the days, yeah
I don't know why things had to change, yeah
