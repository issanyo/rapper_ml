[Verse 1]
Ever since the first time I laid eyes on you, I saw the truth
No questions, just proof
They talk but, I ain't hear a thing they said about you
Ever since the first time we laid
Everybody want details, I don't say nothin'
I won't say nothin', if you don't say nothin'
'Cause this is between us
Yeah we gon' fight
But I'ma love you till it's alright
Ain't gon' find these answers outside
Boy, we don't need nobody's advice

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me a shoulder to cry on
And I'll be alright
I'll be the one you rely on
This love

[Chorus]
Ain't none of your friends business
Ain't none of my friends business
It's ours, all ours, nobody else's
None of your friends business
Ain't none of my friends business
(No, no, no, no)
Ain't none of your friends business
Ain't none of my friends business
Boy it's ours, baby it's ours

[Verse 2]
Don't ask me "how was the sex"
That's between me, my man, and our bed
Plus, I know how you hoes get
I ain't tryna lose a friend telling you how my man do it the best
And the same goes for you baby, I know how niggas do
Your friends be talking crazy, acting like bitches, too
Too, you know they do

[Chorus]
Ain't none of your friends business
Ain't none of my friends business
Ain't none of your friends business
Ain't none of my friends business
Boy it's ours, baby it's ours

[Verse 3]
So we don't need nobody else, all we need is us
Opinions get involved baby, it fucks up all the trust
The bond, the love
You're scared, me too
He hurt me, she hurt you
You taking a risk, well me too
