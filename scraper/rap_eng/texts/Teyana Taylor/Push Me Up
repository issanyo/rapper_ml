Come follow me and take my hand now
Out of body and in a state of mind
But, beat is taking over myâ€”
And this is my favorite part, part, part
I need it here, and hear it louder now
Tell the DJ turn it up
This can be addictive, I know, I don't want it to stop, stop
'Cause I'm not ready to go, go
Now let the beat drop

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tonight it's you and me,  glad you like to disagree
This ain't all in my mind
Spinning slowly, need you to pull me closely
We'll party till morning time
I need you to push me up higher
Push me up higher, turn me up louder
Turn me up, t-turn me up
Push me up higher, push me up higher, turn me up louder
Turn me up, turn me up

[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
I don't wanna stop, stop, don't wanna stop
I got a smile on my face now, 'cause the DJ's playing what I wanna hear now
And he better not stop, oh
Baby, won't you come along and take my hand
Spin me around, take me to the ground, ground, oh ground
And tell me how the sounds, sounds, sounds, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tonight it's you and me, glad you like to disagree
This ain't all in my mind
Spinning slowly, need you to pull me closely
We'll party till morning time
I need you to push me up higher
Push me up higher, turn me up louder
Turn me up, t-turn me up
Push me up higher, push me up higher, turn me up louder
Turn me up, turn me up

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Can you feel the beat, it's making me lose control
Going out my mind babe, you know
I don't wanna leave the dancefloor, whoa, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tonight it's you and me, glad you like to disagree
This ain't all in my mind
The room is spinning slowly, need you to pull me closely
We'll party till morning time
I need you to push me up higher
Push me up higher, turn me up louder
Turn me up, t-turn me up
Push me up higher, push me up higher, turn me up louder
Turn me up, turn me up
