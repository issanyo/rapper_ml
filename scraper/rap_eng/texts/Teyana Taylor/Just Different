[Verse 1]
I swear, I swear, I'm hurting, babe
I just don't understand
Handed you my heart, somewhere in the dark
In the drop
Missed a couple parts, then it stopped
But the beat changed
I can't think straight, yeah
Like a work of art, lookin' at my heart
On the wall, tell me what it mean to ya, he say she say

[Chorus 1]
I tried to explain, but words are just words, no difference
Still love in my heart, it's not the same, it's just different

[Verse 2]
And you break my heart
You got it to start
No surprise, do it every time
Then you go for a joy ride on your side
Actin' like Iâ€™m not lovin' every drop
Then we fall, Pull over the car
Goin' wild, free way
If they see me

[Chorus 2]
I tried to explain, but words are just words, can't quit this
The love in my heart is not the same, it's different
It's different

[Outro]
Know you, know you hurtin' baby
Just don't understand
(Just don't understand)
I swear, I swear (I swear, I swear)
Just don't understand
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
