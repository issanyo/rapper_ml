[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

[Spoken: Lauryn Hill]
What is thisâ€”what is this delay on me?
Like, it's slowing me down, like the whole time I been singing
It's slowing me down
Do you hear it? Hello? Huh, hello?
Yeah, yo yo yo
Aye, I, I, I
