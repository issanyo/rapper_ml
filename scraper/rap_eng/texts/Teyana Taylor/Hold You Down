[Intro: Red Cafe]
Huh... yeah
What else?
No need to prolong this thing
Let's get to it.. Psycho

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
I came for the money, fuck the bullshit
Rich nigga in the hood, guess I'm hood rich
Fornicating with models and all this dirty money
Introduce her to the life, now she working for me
Never do permanent shit with temporary people
Loyalty from the cradle to cemetery people
These real words, I live by
While I wave at the rich neighbors I live by, yeah

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
You will never find another woman like me
I will always be the realest
Baby, don't you worry, I will hold you down
So let me be your, be, be, be, be, be, be...
I wanna ride with you, roll with you, roll with you, ride
Baby, hold you down and you'll never stop, oh no

[Verse 2: Red Cafe]
Yeah, what else?
Psycho, huh
Pop bottles to celebrate every day though
I'm playing with real paper, not Play Doh
Old haters, new haters, tell 'em form a line
My flight delayed but money on time
Passion of a thug, down bitch for life
Treat it like religion, passion of Christ
I'm a dealer and ev'rybody's a customer
I'm getting to it, ev'ryday I'm a hustler
Lactose intolerant, but I love cheese
They're calling me the king, guess I must be
Work hard, play hard, this real life
This what a champion look like
Story unfold, rags to the riches
Rolls for the kings, Jag for the missus
Rolex wrist wear for the 6th year
Chop nemes, you might see my bitch there
Ha, believe that, yeah.. psycho, psycho

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
You will never find another woman like me
I will always be the realest
Baby, don't you worry, I will hold you down
So let me be your, be, be, be, be, be, be...
I wanna ride with you, roll with you, roll with you, ride
Baby, hold you down and you'll never stop, oh no

[Verse 3: Red Cafe]
Psycho, huh
Took a flight to Vegas for the night life
Feeling quite nice, what your life like?
I been going hard since I've been a free man
Only nigga I call's be my weed man
My lady been riding with me from day one
Co-star in my gang flick, take one
Double cut, world cup, where you'll find us
Don't be mad at the winners, step ya grind up

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
You will never find another woman like me
I will always be the realest
Baby, don't you worry, I will hold you down
So let me be your, be, be, be, be, be, be...
I wanna ride with you, roll with you, roll with you, ride
Baby, hold you down and you'll never stop, oh no

[Outro: Teyana Taylor]
Baby, let me hold you down, oh yeah
Oh, baby, let me hold you now, oh, yeah
Oh yeah...
Baby, let me hold you, down, down
