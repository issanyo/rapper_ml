Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty

[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
Yeah, lil daddy, I see you looking at me
Know you wanna make it happen, so you better make a move
And I got it, just look at my body
Know you wanna get it popping, tell me what you wanna do
Yeah, so don't act like you ain't heard about me
Super swag with a bunch of bad girls around me
Yeah, now watch me back it up
And if I see a boy I like, I better bag him up

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty

He choosin', he choosin'
Lookin' at my booty, lookin' at my booty, lookin'-lookin' at my booty
He choosin', he choosin'
Lookin' at my booty, lookin' at my booty, lookin'-lookin' at my booty
He choosin', he choosin'
Lookin' at my booty, lookin' at my booty, lookin'-lookin' at my booty
He choosin', he choosin'
Lookin' at my booty, lookin' at my booty, lookin'-lookin' at my booty

[Verse 2: Teyana Taylor]
This lil lady, be dropping boys crazy
If you see me in the building, then you know they have to pay me
All cash, tell 'em throw it in the bag
Then I'll leave in a Mercedes, yeah you know these broads hate me (yeah, yeah)
But don't act like you don't know about me, say my name
And watch them all crowd around me
Yeah, he want me back it up
And I'm the reason why your boyfriend actin' up

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
He choosin', he choosin'
Lookin' at my booty, lookin' at my booty, lookin'-lookin' at my booty
He choosin', he choosin'
Lookin' at my booty, lookin' at my booty, lookin'-lookin' at my booty
He choosin', he choosin'
Lookin' at my booty, lookin' at my booty, lookin'-lookin' at my booty
He choosin', he choosin'
Lookin' at my booty, lookin' at my booty, lookin'-lookin' at my booty

[Verse 3: Travis Porter]
Okay, oh Teyana how I wanna-wanna see you dance
I don't really give a damn, you can go and tell your man
And I know you kinda busy, you can add me to your plans
I just wanna see you shake it, shake it, now I'm in a trance
If they play this song right here you know they gotta bring it back again
I know you ain't a stripper but I gotta throw a stack or ten
Beautiful, immaculate, and her bag Louis
And when she walk in, niggas look at that booty

[Bridge: Travis Porter]
Look at that booty, look at that booty, look at that booty
Look-look at that booty
Look at that booty, look at that booty, look at that booty
Look-look at that booty

[Verse 4: Travis Porter]
Oh yeah I'm choosin', looking at your booty
With your lil tight pants, you're such a cutie
I might be looking at you, but I ain't gon' look too hard
Make a nigga wanna fight [?], you don't really wanna make me start
God damn in the morning and she making me want it
Her ass fat and I wonder if she gon' let me jump on it
Her booty lookin' so pretty, I just wanna go feel it
If I enjoy my night, I might fly you back to my city

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty
Oohee oohee, look at my booty

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
He choosin', he choosin'
Lookin' at my booty, lookin' at my booty, lookin'-lookin' at my booty
He choosin', he choosin'
Lookin' at my booty, lookin' at my booty, lookin'-lookin' at my booty
He choosin', he choosin'
Lookin' at my booty, lookin' at my booty, lookin'-lookin' at my booty
He choosin', he choosin'
Lookin' at my booty, lookin' at my booty, lookin'-lookin' at my booty
