[Verse 1]
Damn, I want my baby back
It's so cold without her
Cold without her, she's gone
Now I'm alone, no one to hold on
Cause she was the only one
And I know I was dead wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you, if you
See her soon, ask her will she forgive me

[Chorus]
If you ever see her, if you ever meet her
If you ever get a chance to sit down and talk to her
Let her know it's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold here without her
And tell her I miss her, tell her I need her
Tell her I want her, I really want her
To come back home, back to keep me warm
Tell her I'm sorry, I'm really sorry
Can you forgive me? Please forgive me
And come back home, keep me safe and warm

[Verse 2]
Damn, my baby's really gone
I don't know if she's coming home
My luck's up, I know
Tell me what to do to get her back
Back where her heart belongs
Been gone from me too long

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you, see my boo
Please can you, can you tell her for me?

[Chorus]
If you ever see her, if you ever meet her
If you ever get a chance to sit down and talk to her
Let her know it's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold here without her
And tell her I miss her, tell her I need her
Tell her I want her, I really want her
To come back home, back to keep me warm
Tell her I'm sorry, I'm really sorry
Can you forgive me? Please forgive me
And come back home, keep me safe and warm

[Bridge]
All them girls across the world
You know you gotta be my girl
All them girls across the world
You know you gotta be my girl
All them girls across the world
You know you gotta be my girl
All them girls across the world
You know you gotta be my girl

[Chorus]
If you ever see her, if you ever meet her
If you ever get a chance to sit down and talk to her
Let her know it's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold here without her
