[Intro: Iman Shumpert]
Uh, we ain't been to sleep
If you ain't come to dance, you offending me
Don't worry about your girls, I got friend with me
Let me isolate you and get you into me
Girl, lipstick on a red cup
Cornballs got you fed up
Huh, you could pop it with your leg up
Me and you could tear a bed up

[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
I caught you looking at my body, boy it's on tonight
Feeling it, the vibe is crazy in this party, just turned off the lights

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Baby cause all I wanna do is just wind it slow on you
And I don't care if we don't make it home
We can go on and on and on

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Baby won't you come and party
(Who's gonna make it home tonight)
We can do it
(Who's gonna make it home tonight)
Baby it's the weekend
(Who's gonna make it home tonight, tonight
Who's gonna make it home tonight)

[Verse 2: Teyana Taylor]
All I wanna do is share the night with you
I hope it's cool so we can make it all night
We can make it all night
And boy I'm feeling you, I hope you're feeling me too
I hope you're in the mood, so we can get it tonight
We can get it tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Baby cause all I wanna do is just wind it slow on you
And I don't care if we don't make it home
We can go on and on and on

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
(Who's gonna make it home tonight)
Baby we can do it
(Who's gonna make it home tonight)
Baby all I wanna do is
(Who's gonna make it home tonight, tonight
Who's gonna make it home tonight)

[Bridge: Teyana Taylor]
Shawty swing my way, sho' look good to me, me
Now would you please swing my way
Shawty swing my way

[Verse 3: Iman Shumpert (Teyana Taylor)]
Well baby this is what it feel like in real life
I reach vibes out the window cause it feels right
Late night, all the essentials on the night stand
If I'm paying for the morning, gotta hit it when the flight land
Yeah, what it's like to be perfect
You're worth me working 9 til 5
It's 95 and I'm shirtless, baby just work it
Pretty brown brown like the filth me and the homies just purchased
(Cause you got a rise, so tell me is you down to ride?)
Baby you got it, your eyes glued to my body
Like a couple of wallets is stuck to your back pockets
(Cause you got a rise, and I really wanna make you mine)
So come with me, cause that's gon' be
Your every medium if me and you in between the sheets

[Bridge: Teyana Taylor]
Now would you please swing my way
Shawty swing my way
