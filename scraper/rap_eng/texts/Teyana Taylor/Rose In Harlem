[Intro]
A rose in Harlem, a rose in Harlem
A rose in Harlem, a rose in Harlem

[Verse 1]
Been through more than a lil' bit
Been through more than a lil' bit
But I ain't callin' no names out
No, no free promotion
Naw, naw I ain't late, I don't do due dates
No sneak diss, no sneak shit
That's just how I was raised
Had to get it out the soil
I been down, I been loyal
When you really hold it down
Niggas ain't even really down for ya
Oh no, what a shame
10 years in the game
Niggas like 'You ain't hot? You ain't pop yet?
What's up wit' you and Ye?'

[Chorus: (Sample) & Teyana]
(A rose in Harlem) Grew out the concrete
(A rose in Harlem) You know it ain't sweet
(A rose in Harlem) Can't tell me any- any- any- anything

[Refrain]
It be the ones who say they ride for you
It be the ones, the ones you love, them too
It be the ones who swear they real, not true
It be them ones, It be them ones
Don't get caught up
It be the ones, the ones you closest to
It be the ones, the ones you trust - them too
It be the ones, the ones you look up to
It be the ones
Don't get caught up, young girl

[Chorus: (Sample) & Teyana]
(A rose in Harlem) Grew out the concrete
(A rose in Harlem) You know it ain't sweet
(A rose in Harlem) Can't tell me any- any- any- anything

[Verse 2]
Been through more than a lil' bit
Been through more than a lil' bit
But I ain't callin' no names out
No, no free promotions
If it ain't 'bout blessings
I can't even address it
I just bought my third house
No album out and I got 'em asking
'What do she do?' I do everything
I move everything
Put that on my wedding ring
Put that on my baby name
All these fake smiles
These chicks must just came from a dentist
I can tell it ain't genuine
I get so offended

[Chorus: (Sample) & Teyana]
(A rose in Harlem) Grew out the concrete
(A rose in Harlem) You know it ain't sweet
(A rose in Harlem) Can't tell me any- any- any- anything

[Refrain]
It be the ones who say they ride for you
It be the ones, the ones you love, them too
It be the ones who swear they real, not true
It be them ones, It be them ones
Don't get caught up
It be the ones, the ones you closest to
It be the ones, the ones you trust - them too
It be the ones, the ones you look up to
It be the ones
It be the ones who say they ride for you
It be the ones, the ones you love, them too
It be the ones who swear they real, not true
It be them ones, It be them ones
Don't get caught up
It be the ones, the ones you closest to
It be the ones, the ones you trust - them too
It be the ones, the ones you look up to
It be the ones
Don't get caught up, young girl

[Outro]
A rose in Harlem, a rose in Harlem
A rose in Harlem, a rose in Harlem
Don't get caught up, young girl
