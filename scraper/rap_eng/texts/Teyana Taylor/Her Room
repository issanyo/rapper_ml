[Verse 1]
Chillin' in my bedroom, wife-beater and my panties on
Just got a phone call that you was out with your new girl
The nigga that I did love really kinda threw me off
Feel like I'm drowning in sorrow, where is my lifeguard?

[Chorus 1]
Fuck that new girl that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I said fuck that new girl that you think you found
But you calling me even when she's around
I'm just saying, with me you had better
I know your boys have told you that lately
After me, you couldn't find better
Notice that your new girl ain't me (ain't me, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Kisses from a rebound, she's just a girl you keep around
I see all of your phone calls, but I don't have the time to pick up no more
All the shit that we been through, and I admit it boy I miss you (damn)
And I been sippin' on this champagne, a little tipsy so I call you back to say

[Chorus 1]
Fuck that new girl that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I said fuck that new girl that you think you found
But you calling me even when she's around
I'm just saying, with me you had better
I know your boys have told you that lately
After me, you couldn't find better
Notice that your new girl ain't me (she ain't T, yeah)

[Verse 3]
You gon' be trippin' when I'm at a party
You see these niggas lookin' at my body
You wanna grab me when you see me leaving
Won't take you back, and I'll give you the reasons
I told you I'd leave, knowing I wanted to stay
You didn't try, you let me walk away
Starting to think all niggas are the same
The look on your face tells me that you're ashamed
Wanted to love you, but now I'm afraid
You say you need me and how much you've changed
I don't believe you, it could be just game
Trust isn't something you give out, it's gained

[Bridge]
Didn't wanna give up
Say you want me back now, got my feelings mixed up
I just wanna move on, I need someone that I can lean on
And it won't be a nigga like you

[Chorus 2]
I'm just saying, with me you had better
I can’t even remember the damn words
Because you told me—
Your new girl ain't me, she ain't
I'm faded

[Outro]
Care for me, care for me
I know you care for me
There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me?
Care for me, care for me
I know you care for me
There for me, there for me
You said you there for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me?
Where, where were you when I needed you?
