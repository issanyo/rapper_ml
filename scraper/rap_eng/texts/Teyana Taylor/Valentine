[Verse 1]
Ooh, baby
Take me to a place I ain't been lately
We could do something tonight, let's go crazy
Boy, just you and me, your friends gon' hate me
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the rules I wanna break
And the chance you gotta take
If you wanna be in love
Baby, I ain't gotta fake
And your heart ain't gonna break
If you come with me
Baby, can we speed it up?

[Chorus]
I wanna be the girl, the girl of your dreams
And I gotta be the girl, was he made for me?
Boy, can I be your girl? If you want me to be
Don't be doggin' me, be my valentine
My valentine, my valentine, yeah

Boy, use me
Come and kiss me on my neck
Give it to me right there
You told me, if you feel something when we touch
Girl, excuse me, it's all me, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the rules I wanna break
And the chance you gotta take
If you wanna be in love
Baby, I ain't gotta fake
And your heart ain't gonna break
If you come with me
Baby, can we speed it up?

[Chorus]
I wanna be the girl, the girl of your dreams
And I gotta be the girl, was he made for me?
Boy, can I be your girl? If you want me to be
Don't be doggin' me, be my valentine
My valentine, my valentine, yeah
