[Verse 1]
Breathe in, relax
Boy set your mind for what's coming next
Tell me secrets so I can perform what you like, boy
What's your request? Request

[Pre-Hook 1]
Whisper what you want, I get it
Ain't no holding back, let's get offended
Request, I'll say
Suggest, boy your wish is my command
Say the word and I will do it

[Chorus]
Call me, I can be anything that you need me to be
Just request it, boy I'm your hotline
Your personal 1-900 number
Anything you want, I'm your lover
Just call me, I can be anything that you need me to be
Just request it, boy I'm your hotline
Your personal 1-900 number
Anything you want, I'm your lover

[Verse 2]
Lights on, lights off
Any time of day or night, I'm on call
Public, private
However you want it, I'm in place to make it like that

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Tell me what you want, I get it
You ain't gotta worry, it's a secret
Request, request
Boy your wish is my command
Say a word and I will do it

[Chorus]
Call me, I can be anything that you need me to be
Just request it, boy I'm your hotline
Your personal 1-900 number
Anything you want, I'm your lover
Just call me, I can be anything that you need me to be
Just request it, boy I'm your hotline
Your personal 1-900 number
Anything you want, I'm your lover

[Verse 3]
Want me on your porch in nothing but a trench coat
And maybe you wanna see me in your office after school
Boy let's wait, you can get it how you want it
Tell me and I'm on it
'Cause I want it bad as you
Let me make your wish come true, true

[Chorus]
Call me, I can be anything that you need me to be
Just request it, boy I'm your hotline
Your personal 1-900 number
Anything you want, I'm your lover
Just call me, I can be anything that you need me to be
Just request it, I'm your hotline
Your personal 1-900 number
Anything you want, I'm your lover (tru-u-ue)
