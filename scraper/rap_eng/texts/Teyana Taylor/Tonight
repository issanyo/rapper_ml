[Chorus]
Do you know what tonight is?
Boy it's all about you and me, all bout you and me
Do you know what tonight is?
Boy it's all about you and me, baby can't you see

[Verse 1]
Look how you got me baby, feel so good to me
I can spend all night, in this slow, slow grind
Over and over, give me all of your love
Wrap your arms around me tight, make me lose my mind

[Chorus]
Do you know what tonight is?
Boy it's all about you and me, all bout you and me
Do you know what tonight is?
Boy it's all about you and me, baby can't you see

[Verse 2]
Doing that thing you like, I know it drives you crazy
Let me know it feels good, like a good boy should
I already told ya, I can never get enough
Seems like every time, take me more and more high

[Pre-Chorus]
All I wanna do for you baby, is give you something real
Something you can feel
(Something you can feel all night)
All you gotta do for me babe is give me what I want
(I just wanna give you)
But give it to me slow

[Chorus]
Do you know what tonight is?
Boy it's all about you and me, all bout you and me
Do you know what tonight is?
Boy it's all about you and me, baby can't you see
