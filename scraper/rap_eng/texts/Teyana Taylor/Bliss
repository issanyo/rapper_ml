[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
Ooh baby, the day you stepped into my world
You noticed I'm that kind of girl
Who loves her diamonds and white pearls
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa-oh
So tempt me
To jetset away in London, to sip on some tea
You surprise me with gifts from Tiffany
Ohhh (la la la la la la la la)
I love the way we livin' boy
But my daddy say, "You don't need that boy"
So let's run away, let's run away, way-way
Momma say I'm too young for love
And lovin' you is all I'm thinkin' of
My heart tells me that you're the one
It's the feeling you give, it is

[Hook: Teyana Taylor]
Pure bliss
Like you've got the key to my heart
Simple as a touch and a kiss
Never knew a feeling like this
Pure bliss, pure bliss
Nobody can tear us apart
Baby it's as good as it gets (kiss kiss kiss)
Loving you will never be hard
This is pure bliss

[Verse 2: John Legend]
I remember, when the pilot closed the door
He said, "It's time for lift off"
You said, "What'd you choose me for?"
Don't ever wonder, cause you deserve the best
Once you reach the top, you'll never question why you left
Ohh, my world is yours
What you waitin' for?
Let's run away, let's run away!
Our friends, say we're crazy
But we can't listen baby
They've never had it like this
They don't know what it is

[Hook: John Legend and Teyana Taylor]
Pure bliss
Like you've got the key to my heart
Simple as a touch and a kiss
Never knew a feeling like this
Pure bliss, pure bliss
Nobody can tear us apart
Baby it's as good as it gets (kiss kiss kiss)
Loving you will never be hard
This is pure bliss
