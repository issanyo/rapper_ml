[Chores: Teyana Taylor ]
I got a confession
I ain't learn my lesson
I took acouple shots and
Now I'm drunk texting
I just wanna touch you
The one that I could run too
I got a confession
I just wanna let you see how I'm coming
So you Know how I'm coming
I just wanna let you see how I'm coming
You kno how I'm coming

[verse 1: Dreezy]
Empty bottles that was once Moscato follow drinking models
Open up and swallow Drinkin out the nozzle I forgot to model
I left with a  waddle if I resono I won't know today tomorrow
I'm texting slur looking for my words like I'm playing boggle
Nigga boosting up my confidence
I'm a Aires so you know I'm dominant
I might drip on your lip like a  condiment
Got a body out this world like a monument , honor it
Backspace lol don't tell I just called a cab to come get me
Eyes low and I'm way past tipsy
Said I'm not a freak then I turn in to missy , miss me
You know I be pokin from the side of me
He said he never seen this side of me
I said a good girl I what i tried to be
But I'm gone put it all on you if you tryin' me
My body callin' so I'm dialing digits
I'm Fiendin' I'm gone text him something explicit
Ain't buy my drink but I'm gone pay a visit
Be there in a minute give him what he missin'
Let get it

[Verse 2 Dreezy]
Thought I was lyin' now I on the way
When I pull up what you gonna say
I'm so in it I just slipped up and called him bae
I was feeling my self with my Lingerie
I ain't talking crazy I know what I'm saying
I'm a little younger but no I ain't playing
I been thinking about it just as much as you
Been a minute got me wanting something new
Favor for a favor I got different flavor
Yes I do deliver but no I don't cater
Got you feeling major waking up the neighbors
I might beg for Marcy but Don't want a savior
I left the club on a tuesday
Got the shit to keep a nigga off of 2k
I hit the Duc√® yeah got me to straight
Working on my body you would think I'm tryin' lose weight
I'm just Cappin' but I'm quick to leave him if he ever tweak
Word around his pipe game crazy
And I might just need for you to Fix a leak
Got him checking for me like that nigga meek
Now he catching flights to see me every week
With my legs around you boy there ain't no runnin'
I just wanna show you how I'm coming
