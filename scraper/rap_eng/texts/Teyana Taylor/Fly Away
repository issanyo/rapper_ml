Boy I don't need nobody just me and you
It's the truth [Laugh]...

[Chorus:]
Boy I don't need nobody just me and you
It's the truth
Cause you know that when you're not around it
Ruins my day you make it special
Let's fly away

Follow me to the stars (stars)
Nd the moon where the skies turn blue
Let's fly away
I'm impressed by the things you do
Too young but I'm in love with you
You know you take me on a natural high
Let's fly away

[Chorus]

Float with me to eternity
Blessed indeed (Hey)
Let's fly away
Baby will... will you come with me
Just say u will (will)
Let's fly away

[Chorus]

Now that your here with me
You should just stay with me
Nd picture how great it could be
All of the joy you bring
It means so much to me
Baby come fly with me

[Rap:]
Lookin at you boy
I'm feeling ya swagga
And I ain't a dude but I might try bag ya
Teach you ya abc's like
Frankie Lymen's
I'm a Queen you could be my King my royal highness
Fly away to the foreign islands
Lay low and a resort like da
King of knowledge
Don't need nobody Boy
Just me and you
Cause they need a passport
In order to find us
Yes sir

[x2:]
Let's fly away to the stars(I don't need nobody to know)
Let's fly away to the moon
OoOo Baby I'm with you
SoOo won't you come with me

[Chorus]
