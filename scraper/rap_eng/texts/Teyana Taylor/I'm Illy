[Intro: Chris Brown]
Yeah, '09 our year, haha
Mixtape status, YouTube, haha
Teyana Taylor, what's good?
C. Breezy in the buildin'
Yeah, man, let's go in

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I'm in the clouds, homie, no gas mask
Paper long, stacked higher than giraffe ass
I'm used to drivin' spaceships so I'm landin' wrong
On some ugly shit, ET with a bandana on
Dolce book bag, Louis rag, hangin' out the right side
Red lightnin' in my hair, I'm lookin' on the bright side
Listen to my music, yes, I highly recommend it
But if you ain't messin' with it, why the hell you commentin'?
And I'm really lovin' rappin' now, know I had to get it in
Listenin' to rappers and some of 'em soundin' feminine
Any stage or any show I been there or I done it
Too big and these girls run from it, haha
These young niggas here now, yeah, we 'bout to shut 'em down
My little sister Teyana Taylor and yeah, I'm Chris Brown
And ain't no goons with me, gon' act silly
Don't forget, mothersucker, I'm illy

[Verse 2: Teyana Taylor]
Uh, I guess the magazines just ain't enough, still wanna play with us
When that beat get murdered, right away you know they say it's us
Blog sites, web sites, they all know I'm dead nice
Porsche at the red light, you Honda chicks is dead tight
Money steady generatin', haters give me inspiration
Swagged out generation, got your child board skatin'
M.O.B so solid, Ray-Bans so poppin'
Multi-colored finger nails, cranberry phone posse
Killin' every beat I touch, body everythin' I say
Pen game, whip game, I just bought a car today
Jealous of my one of a kind swag, you're dumb match
Shorty tried to copy and paste my style, she's dumb gas
Scared of nobody, I push it to the limit
You rap chicks is burnin', here's a number to a clinic
CB is with me, get familiar with the movement
Neglect every instrument to my body and abuse it

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Alexander McQueen jeans, I'm on that mean shit
Super Sweet 16 clean, my magazine clip
Yeah, you a hater now, check, check out my gators now
Rockin' goose downs and I'm with a belt crocodile
Can't forget my fur coat, shawty name Merlow
And she mad wild and I like the way it pur yo
2012, yeah, I'm rockin' new denims
With the temperature control all in 'em

[Verse 4: Teyana Taylor]
Yeah, I'm gon' go hard, flow hard
Every time I spit is up to par, you know I show off
Lyrics is impeccable, you know I'm gon' act the fool
Yo he and my model swag, Y 3 2 cool
Yeah, my block is forty left, you know we don't play no games
Timberland hard denims, wife beat swag flames
Harlem is my birth place, L.A where my work lay
Haters check my profile, naw, this ain't MySpace, ow
