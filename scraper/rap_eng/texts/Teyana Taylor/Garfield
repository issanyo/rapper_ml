[Intro]
Peace on the track

[Chorus]
I've been waiting so long to get it (x2)
I've been puttin on
I've been comin strong
I've been waiting so long
I was cuttin up the ave
Developing the swag
All this bread in my basket (All this bread)
Nothin handed, i'm snatchin
They always knew that i had it
I've been waiting so long to get it (I been waiting)
I've been waiting so long (I've been waiting x2)
I've been waiting so long to get it
I've been waiting so long

[Verse 1]
They fell in love with the swang
Ain't enough time in the day
Ain't enough lies in the world
I could turn wood to a pearl
It's loud I can't hear what they say
They mouth  just moving their bowels
They don't do shit that they say
They should just throw in the towel
I  live my life on the prowl
You cool but you fool in regards to this chain
Life of the God (huh?)
It's good to be God's son (I've been waiting)
Starting waves  like the hair on my Godson
He get it from his mom's (huh?)
Well take it from me nothing's legit
I won't forget
I'm holding grudges
I got a list
Imma go down
Shoot shit! (I been waiting)
Boom
Let me develop the play
Let me take over your ear
Let me influence your vibe
Let me take you out  your body
It's like we ain't even here (ooh)
This is what the God feel like
I can eat steak everyday
Ain't enough lies in the world
I just turned wood to a pearl
It's loud, I don't hear what they say (ooh)

[Chorus]
I've been waiting so long to get it
I've been waiting so long (I've been waiting x3)
I've been waiting so long to get it (I've been waiting x2)
I've been waiting so long (I've been waiting x2)
I've been waiting so long to get it (x2)
I've been puttin on
I've been coming strong
I've been waiting so long
I was cuttin up the ave
Developing the swag
All this bread in my basket
Nothin handed, i'm snatchin
They always knew that I had it
I've been waiting so long to get it
I've been waiting so long (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting so long to get it (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting so long (I've been waiting)

[Verse 2]
Ooh I don't look up to a lot
I don't look down unless it's gold
That's on my wrist
They part the sea when we walk
You think the story get old
They thought the love would just fade
They thought they'd finally get paid
But fuck is you on
You using us for your glow
You can't do shit on your own
We got the drop on your home
We pull up luxury
Handle like poverty probably not the best mix for a rivalry
Properly played like we set up a robbery
Who gon tell us to get off of this property
How dare they try to take what we work for
Dressed up even if they say work flow
Get stomped out in hard bottoms that's church flow
You'll ever take the shit that I work for
At times I don't see my daughter
Plenty times I don't see my wife
And I need my fam
Ain't nothin else on my mind
I told T it'll be alright
Cuz this shit get real
They don't ever get to see our fights
This for the culture like a Migo night
In the 305 and now the doors go up like juice ah fi
We got the crowd goin oooo la la
(Yay yay yay)

[Chorus]
I've been waiting so long to get it
I've been waiting so long (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting so long to get it (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting so long (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting so long to get it (x2)
I've been puttin on
I've been coming strong
I've been waiting so long
I was cuttin up the ave
Developing the swag
All this bread in my basket (All this bread)
Nothin handed, i'm snatchin
They always knew that I had it
I've been waiting so long to get it
I've been waiting so long (i've been waiting)
I've been waiting so long to get it (i've been waiting)
I've been waiting so long (i've been waiting)

[Verse 3: Teyana Taylor]
What's goin on
What's takin so long
I feel like time wasted I wrote all these songs
Run up them digits and left it alone
Like this shit ain't me
But maybe i'm wrong
Maybe I need to get back in my zone
Maybe I need to do this shit for me
My pops was a G
It's embedded in me
I hustle for mine and now they gon see
I'm destined for greatness
So sick of the fakeness
Cut they ass off
No need for replacements
Only the family, As if i'm a racist
Got me a bag and I kept on chasin
Ain't got no money, the fuck out my face then
I'd rather be rich than famous
So fuck trying to do it for the gram
I'm just trying to feed the fam
Plus they know who I am
Tax same Don Dada with the pints in the challie
Bitch i've been a plug before I ever went to Cali
Been ridin hemi before they knew I had it in me
Cop the wheels
Book T, brought her out for the city
How the fuck did they forget me?
It's cool
The beats still hittin
My shit still move
Shit lit, Drinkin henny
Ain't no passin blunts
Roll my pots (?) and they passed it once
Damn

[Chorus]
I've been waiting so long to get it
I've been waiting  long (i've been waiting)
I've been waiting so long to get it (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting so long (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting so long to get it (x2)
I've been puttin on
I've been coming strong
I've been waiting so long
I was cutting up the ave
Developing the swag
All this bread in my basket (All this bread)
Nothin handed i'm snatchin
They always knew that I had it
I've been waiting so long to get it
I've been waiting so long (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting so long to get it (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting so long

[Outro]
I've been waiting so long
I've been waiting!!!
