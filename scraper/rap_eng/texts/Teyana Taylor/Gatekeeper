[Verse 1]
Give me your hand and I'll take away your pain
This to shall pass, it's such a shame
I'll be your army, your army of one
And you'll feel better when we're done

[Pre-Chorus]
Wrap yourself in my arms
I'll keep you safe from harm
Fall into me, love is all you need
Walk back from the edge
We can only do our best
Gotta keep on doing
You're forgiven, you're forgiven, you're forgiven

[Chorus]
I'll be gatekeeper
I'll be your gatekeeper
All your secrets, drop your defense
I'll be gatekeeper
I'll be your gatekeeper
All your secrets, drop your defense

[Verse 2]
Tell all your secrets, share all your shame
I'll hold you closely, you'll be okay
We're only human, we're sometimes wrong
Don't be your motto, tell someone

[Pre-Chorus]
Wrap yourself in my arms
I'll keep you safe from harm
Fall into me, love is all you need
So walk back from the edge
We can only do our best
Gotta keep on doing
You're forgiven, you're forgiven, you're forgiven

[Chorus]
I'll be gatekeeper
All your secrets, drop your defense
I'll be gatekeeper
All your secrets, drop your defense

[Outro]
Said I'll be your gatekeeper
I'll beâ€”
