[Verse]
Give me your love love, gimme
You knock me down
My pride hits the ground, don't know if this is going away
My heartbeat jumps to the tip of my tongue
I think you're wanting to say come over here
Give me you're love love, gimme
Give me you're love love, gimme
Boy, you don't know what you're doin' to me
Just give me your love love, gimme
Right here, don't care
It could just be love or something like it
Boy I don't know, but I need you right now
It could just be love, or something like it
I think I like it, but I'll know soon enough
