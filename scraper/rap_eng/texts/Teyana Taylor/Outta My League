[Verse 1]
If I tell you, you belong to me
Would you be mine in reality?
And not just in my mind
I'm so tired of being invisible to you
I'm so tired

[Chorus]
How could a boy like you ever want a girl like me?
You're way outta my league
Way outta my league
'Cause boys like you don't go for girls like me
You're way outta my league
Way—

[Verse 2]
I can't believe you stayed
Surprised that you even looked my way
Fuck it, I'm fine if you want it
There's so many reasons to be on it
'Cause I'm the realest, so you feel this
And I don't blame you, no

[Chorus]
How could a boy like you ever want a girl like me?
You're way outta my league
Way outta my league
'Cause boys like you don't go for girls like me
You're way outta my league
Way—

[Verse 3]
No I don't like making mistakes
Cause my heart's so easy to break
That's a risk I don't usually take (ooh, ohh)
Got this feeling I hate to lose
That's the feeling when I'm with you
Doing things I don't usually do, no

[Chorus]
How could a boy like you ever want a girl like me?
You're way outta my league
Way outta my league
'Cause boys like you don't go for girls like me
You're way outta my league
Way outta my league

[Outro]
How could a boy like you ever want a girl like me?
You're way outta my, outta my, outta my league
You're way outta my league
