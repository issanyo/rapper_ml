[Verse 1]
He tells me I'm beautiful everyday
The better part of him, hear him say
Now as you're watching far away
All I can say, "I'm so sorry"
You had your cake and a gift that day
Something that our love didn't create
Now as you watch from far away
All I can say is, "I'm so sorry"
Never again 'cause now I know
Just what it means to love and be loved
Now as you watch from far away
All I can say is, "I'm sorry"

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry you didn't know how to love me
I'm sorry I wasn't beautiful to you
I'm sorry you just didn't understand how to be my man
I'm sorry you couldn't make me happy
And I'm so sorry you never learned how
I'm so sorry it had to be this way
But my heart is so good now
Now as you watch from far away
I said baby, oh, baby
All I can say, "I'm sorry"
I'm sorry you lost me

[Outro]
He tells me I'm beautiful everyday
The better part of him, hear him say
Now as you watch, baby
I'm sorry, youâ€”
I'm sorry
