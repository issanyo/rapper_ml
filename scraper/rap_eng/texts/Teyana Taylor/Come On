[Verse 1]
Can't you see you got this hold on me?
I want you to lift me up and never bring me down (never bring me down)
Won't ever lose control, take it nice and slow
I like the way it feels, could this be love? (Could this be love?)
Wanna give you the recipe of destiny, it starts with me and you
And maybe I'll be the melody so sweet, it's never out of tune
Now I wanna be the one you need, like yeah a breather attached to you
So baby, come on, come on, come on!

[Chorus]
What you do to me? Living in a fantasy
There's no one in the whole wide world
Baby, it's just you and me
So baby, don't you break my heart
And don't you wanna play your card?
So baby baby, come on, come on, come on!
Oh, baby give it to me (baby, give it to me)
And if you like what you see (and if you like what you see)
Oh, baby give it to me (baby, give it to me)
And if you like what you see (and if you like what you see)
Oh, baby give it to me (baby, give it to me)
And if you like what you see (and if you like what you see)
Then baby baby, come on, come on, come on!

[Post-Chorus]
Like sweet morning dew, it took one look at you
And it was plain to see, you are my destiny

[Verse 2]
Shawty, I'm here for you any time you need me
For real boys, me in your world, believe me
Have to make a man feel better than a woman
A queen with a crown that be down for whatever
There's a few things that's forever
Your lady, we can make war, make babies
Back when I was nothing, you made a shawty feel like she was something
That's why I'm with you to this day, bro no frontin'
Even when the skies were grey, you would rub me on my back and say "baby, it'll be okay"
Now that's real to a woman like me, baby
Never ever give you lovin' away, I keep it tight

[Chorus]
What you do to me? Living in a fantasy
There's no one in the whole wide world
Baby, it's just you and me
So baby, don't you break my heart
And don't you wanna play your card?
So baby baby, come on, come on, come on!
Oh, baby give it to me (baby, give it to me)
And if you like what you see (and if you like what you see)
Oh, baby give it to me (baby, give it to me)
And if you like what you see (and if you like what you see)
Oh, baby give it to me (baby, give it to me)
And if you like what you see (and if you like what you see)
Then baby baby, come on, come on, come on!

[Outro]
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
