[Verse 1]
Here we are, going back at it again
Are you serious?
I guess you are, you are, you are
You got me sitting home while you on some other shit
I guess that you must have forgot who you dealing with

[Pre-Chorus]
Well so long
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

[Chorus]
So right before I leave, I put one in the air for love, love, love
Right before I leave, I put one in the air for love, love, love
So long, so long, I'm gone

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna talk
So I'm blocking your calls, pretty sure I heard it all before
Do I need to say more?
While I was home alone, you were away with other chicks
I guess you must have forgot who you're fuckin' with

[Pre-Chorus]
Well so long
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

[Chorus]
So right before I leave, I put one in the air for love, love, love
Right before I leave, I put one in the air for love, love, love
So long, so long, I'm gone

So right before I leave, I put one in the air for love, love, love
Right before I leave, I put one in the air for love, love, love
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
