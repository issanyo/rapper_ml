Strangé: Oh merde alors! Me I don't believe this, you are going to turn down a pussy like this? It's staring you smack in your face, no man can turn down this pussy
Marcus: Will you stop
Strangé: I don't know any man that can refuse this, pussy
Marcus: Will you stop saying "pussy", people are eating in here
Strangé: Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, puss, puss, pussy. So, when are we gonna fuck?

[Verse: Teyana Taylor]
Come fuck me babe, want you to feel me
Come closer babe, but don't tease me
I want you now, can you hear me
Keep banging til I'm satisfied
No I won't apologise
I'ma keep complaining 'til we're naked
So come inside

[Chorus]
[?] acting different
I'm wet, I want attention, baby
Rough sex, touch me, drill me
Tryna get me acting right
When we fight it's only right

[Outro]
Baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Aah, aah, aah
Ooh yeah, yeah
