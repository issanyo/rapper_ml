[Verse 1: Sebastian Mikael]
Girl, I'm here for you
You're under my protection
Just keep going further
And I keep holding you down
Know I gotta rock on the crown
Whenever you're not around
Take a place for you
Cause they don't understand what it's like to be like you
If anybody out there can, baby you know that I do
So I keep holding you down
You just keep on running the town
Make sure you keep your feet on the ground
I'll be waiting for ya

[Chorus]
So let 'em talk, baby look at me
You got me right here by the heart, and I got you
They can try but we never leave
Cause you're the one, you're made for me
Only one that's made for me
Only one that's made for me

[Verse 2: Teyana Taylor]
Boy, I'm here for you
Under your protection
Your love has been a blessing
You teach me all your lessons
I give you my crown
And now I got it, I dare them to come take it now
Because they gotta get past you
That's not happening, no
They don't understand what it's like to be like me
See, I can have anything I wanted, I don't want it
If you're not there beside me
So keep holding me down
I'mma keep on running the town
Make sure you keep yo feet off the ground, oh
I'll be there for you

(Chorus]

[Break]

[Chorus] (x2)
