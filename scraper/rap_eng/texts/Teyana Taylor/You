[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Tellin' me the things you that heard about
Nothin' good comes when you searchin' for the wrong things
Somethin' feels off when I come around
Askin' me questions like, "What do I believe in?"
"You," everyone's a saint 'til the church lets out
That goes for you too
Everything ain't perfect but I do it for...

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Who is you to judge me?
Just 'cause I'm drunk and stumblin' out the club, me, her and her girlfriend
Ain't nobody perfect but the Lord
You always quick to point out all my flaws when I was leaving out yours
Here's a message little girls, little boy
You could be the dirtiest muh'fucker in the world but have morals
Don't nobody give you nothin' 'less you work for it
Ladies get an education, you ain't gotta twerk for it
You know the Lord send you a sign, don't ignore it
And that's whether you study from the Bible or Quran or the Torah
We original, indigenous, god among men
It's two things that's yours, your body and your sin
Gotta claim 'em, just like these so-called conservatives
Fight against the rights of homosexuals then go home and play with lil' kid
Shit, I promised all the shit that I'd ever did
Was to move out and leave the hood and keep me from trappin' not up the river
And my testimony my testament
All the bullshit that I seen happen in life turned me into a pessimist
I'm cynical, yeah, I learned life is all about principle
You so judgmental 'cause you miserable
And my inner peace ain't expendable

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Tellin' me the things you that heard about
Nothin' good comes when you searchin' for the wrong things
Somethin' feels off when I come around
Askin' me questions like, "What do I believe in?"
"You," everyone's a saint 'til the church lets out
That goes for you too
Everything ain't perfect but I do it for...

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I never seen nobody end up in the right place
Worried about the wrong thing
So in tribulation, better do your own thang
See, some of my partners trap and some of 'em gang bang
Some of 'em snort powder, just barely maintain
No fuckin' with the Cali, got degree in Physics
Came home with a diploma, got a job makin' pennies
Homie like me who ain't finished high school, dropped out and went to prison
Still ended up runnin' multi-million dollar businesses
Man, if I tell you shit I knew about
You can tell the difference between me reflectin' and tryna glorify
'Cause most the time this shit be borderline outta line
And you just wanna monetize, only focus on the bottom line
When it deeper than that
We here to analyze life and hope the people connect
We not just out here sellin' reefer, find the cheaper connect
Just waitin' on TIP to spit some shit a G could respect
For real

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Tellin' me the things you that heard about
Nothin' good comes when you searchin' for the wrong things
Somethin' feels off when I come around
Askin' me questions like, "What do I believe in?"
"You," everyone's a saint 'til the church lets out
That goes for you too
Everything ain't perfect but I do it for...

[Outro: T.I.]
Yeah, you see the shit they missin' today is the G-code
You know, what we did, man, we did out of a lack of options, you know?
But we stuck to a code
You win, you lose, but you abide by the code
You dig what I'm sayin'?
