[Hook: Travi$ Scott + Teyana Taylor]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
Round and round they go
Round and round they go
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
Round and round they go
Round and round they go

[Verse: Teyana Taylor]
He said pray for 'em
Get these bitches out the way for 'em
First lady go cray for 'em
So I loaded up the AK for 'em
Hit it down with my head down
Green Jeep with the loud sounds
Deep bass with the mean brow
Do they get what I see now?
Pray for me, put your one hand in the air for me
Anna Wintour need a chair to see how they stare with the bangs and hair for me
It's like they ain't care for me, soul's life is a spare for me
It's like who ain't for care for me, man who's life is to spare for me
I've been getting money where the hell you been now
Now I'm about as, somehow I was getting paid out
Leave me out here it's [?]
1500 golden trophies on this bitch a champion

[Hook: Travi$ Scott + Teyana Taylor]
1500, all in singles (own the city)
Throw it up (throw it up), watch it fall and drop
Round and round they go
Round and round they go
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
Round and round they go
Round and round they go
Own the city
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
Round and round they go
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
Round and round they go
Round and round they go
