[Spoken: Lauryn Hill]
Who I am, you know, has nothing to do with the hair and the shoes and stuff—even though I like shoes—but, you know, it has nothin' to do with that
You know in what I do, I find there's a lot of power in prayer, so I pray for the people who don't understand me
And I tell you, be honest with you, I pray more now to be understood—no, excuse me—to understand than to be understood
I pray now to learn how to love and to be loved, because God has given me abundance so, you know, I don't need God
"These people don't understand me, they think I'm crazy every time I'm on the mic," it's not about that
I pray I understand them so I can talk to them, minister to them even more. You understand what I'm saying?
So I'm just not afraid of, it's no effect, it's immaterial to me because our enemies are not physical bodies, they are actually our family. They don't know it and we don't always know it
But our enemies are not flesh and blood and our problems are not flesh and blood, even though we think they are (think they are, think they are, think they are)
