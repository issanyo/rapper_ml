[Verse 1]
Ooh, you're sent from up above, so divine
Your wonder is a mystifying fight
Can you touch my eyes, I just can't deny
Ooh, you're from another world

[Pre-Chorus]
You bring the light that shines so bright
Can't lose those but you know I can't get enough of you
And so you go to the moon

[Chorus]
It's just the simplest things that will give me asunder
It's like the air I breathe give me the wonder
Forgive me [?] nothing just knowing
You are my eighth wonder
Yes babe, you are my [?]
You are my eighth wonder, wonder

[Post-Chorus]
Hey baby, how you are doing?
I just wanna hold you, uh-huh

[Verse 2]
Ooh, you put the color in the room
Ooh, take my hand and never lead astray
You will be my guide, taking every side
You are from another world

[Pre-Chorus]
You bring the light that shines so bright
Can't lose those but you know I can't get enough of you
And so you go to the moon

[Chorus]
It's just the simplest things that will give me asunder
It's like the air I breathe give me the wonder
Forgive me [?] nothing just knowing
You are my eighth wonder
Yes babe, you are my [?]
You are my eighth wonder, wonder

[Outro]
Now, baby, don't you play no games with me now
I said I wanna hold ya, I wanna touch ya
I wanna feel ya, I wanna squeeze ya
I wanna please ya, yeah
