[Intro]
You might say nothing
Is never too much
Girl what is you talking
Whatever you want

[Verse]
(Yeah, I...)
It's never too much for me
I'm never too nice
Tonight I'm gonna give you what you want
No matter the price
I know you can't wait to see the world
The chance of your life
Right now, I know you are excited, babe
I can see it in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cos you ain't mad at nobody
Whatever holds you down
You ain't saving no paper
Until I came around
You ain't mad at nobody
Whatever holds you down
You ain't saving no paper
Until I came around

[Chorus]
You might say nothing
Is never too much
(Never too much for me)
Girl what is you talking
Whatever you want
(Never too much for me)

[Verse]
Lavish life, you're enticed
Furs and brand new ice
Private planes to paradise
We ain't asking no price
It's right, you wanna get down tonight
Ask to hold my hand
'Sip champagne right out the bottle
Chill, blow these bans

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cos you ain't mad at nobody
Whatever holds you down
You ain't saving no paper
Until I came around
You ain't mad at nobody
Whatever holds you down
You ain't saving no paper
Until I came around

[Chorus]
You might say nothing
Is never too much
(Never too much for me)
Girl what is you talking
Whatever you want
(Never too much for me)

[Bridge]
Anything you want
Whatever you need
Nothing else to talk about
Is neva too much
Anything you want
Whatever you need
Nothing else to talk about
Is neva too much

[Chorus]
You might say nothing
Is never too much
(Never too much for me)
Girl what is you talking
Whatever you want
(Never too much for me)

[Outro]
It's never too much
(Never too much for me)
It's never too much
(Never too much for me)
