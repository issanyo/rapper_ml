All the way 100, all the way, all the way 100
I’m all the way 100, all the way, all the way 100
I’m all the way 100, all the way, all the way 100
I’m all the way 100, all the way, all the way 100
I’m all the way 100, and I’m for real when I’m stunting
We try, traps in the night, yeah
I’m all the way 100, about as real as they come
Feed one, then I’m down for the hype, aight
I’ma always keep it solid, yeah, you family then I got you
Won’t turn my back on my folks
I’m all the way 100, you want it, then I’m gunning
Won’t run, stay down so don’t fall, let’s go

I’m all the way 100, all the way, all the way 100
I’m all the way 100, all the way, all the way 100
I’m all the way 100, all the way, all the way 100

I’m all the way 100, everything that you do
I bet I prolly already done it
Verbal vomit when I spit my ebonic
Smoking the chronic
Can have a dollar in my pocket and walk around hella confident
Fucking is my favorite sport, drinking is my second
Keep my mouth shut if the po boy asking questions
Hash royal, afghanian durban
What I say behind your back I say it in person
Contraband in my left hand, lama in my other hand
I can see I treat these pussies niggas like a sonogram
Y’all sick on the computer murder malcolm
Catching box up baby softer than doctor crappy
California nigga, born and raised in the struggle
I can make your baby mama pussy …
I rather hand with a broke real nigga
Than a fake rich nigga
Fools show they true color when they off that liquor

I’m all the way 100, all the way, all the way 100
I’m all the way 100, all the way, all the way 100
I’m all the way 100, all the way, all the way 100

I’m all the way 100, can’t tell me nothing
Boss living that life, go 365, you ain’t ready to fly
Watch for you just cry
Let them study somethin, see me coming
The hero view that most eyes
I got too much going right now
More in line it’s just prize
Yeah, grown man bizness, she started I finish
In the game we don’t play
Dope emcee go track for track, she gonn move just like yay
I’m all the way 100, money by time
Word to c boy I’m straight…
Yeah out in California come ask about me, bet this what they gonn say

I’m all the way 100, all the way, all the way 100
I’m all the way 100, all the way, all the way 100
I’m all the way 100, all the way, all the way 100
