Yeah, we holler with that drop out
All my niggas got the same dress
Get money, live big
And she trashy, used to drop me off
Now it's foggie, cause I got a Benz
Racks by the park, bitch
All my niggas have the blow
No love for a park bitch
Hittin' dollas by the liquor store
Ain't no more born fibe on the weed(?)
Just fo' me, I need at least an o.z
Goin' hard in the pay, O.G
I'mma get it high lid, homie, nigga

Cartoon niggas, yeah, we call 'em Bruce Wayne
Bust it up, bend the hood, got two dames
Nigga run, who blame? Go bang bang
I'll go, everything call it trinidad
Two bad bitches wit me, yeah, I'm into that
Got caught, chopped up, where the ceiling at?
Got the rap game doped up, feelin' that
Big cock cussin' on this bitch, feelin' that
Hating niggas taking motherfucking high angles
From the bay rap ghost (???)
Nigga giant on these real niggas (alright)
Team madre cups from my real niggas (?)
And my 2k shades, call 'em B40
Bitches get up and the ghost gon' get naughty
We don't play checkers, nigga, we play chess
When it comes to the street shit, I'm the best

Set the ball, we ain't neva follow trance
Set down, she put the world in my hands

You can miss me wit the bullshit
Gettin' money what I'm into
