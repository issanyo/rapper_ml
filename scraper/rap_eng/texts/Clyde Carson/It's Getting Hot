[Chorus]
That fitful hip
That spacial lick
That caught her while and now
She wanna get rip
Go ask your chick
Find out how I get down (damn)
It's gettin' in here (damn)
Act tough till the cops get here (damn)
I got the whole block in here (damn)
So you could get it hot in here (damn)
Ask that boy bout stunt
He'll tell you about something
Any time ya in the club wit me (wit me)
I'll rip though the line
Need no close sign
Everybody wanna hug on me (on me)
Pull the trunk from behind
See that boy shine, look it them thugs on me (on me)
Nothing less then a dime
... and a finer chick who wanna rub on me (on me)
Age eighten and up
Me and chicks are strippin, g-strings for bucks
To the flow, trying to see this movement
Pour dimes like that your clueless
I'm off them grapes
Purple and blue is
Ridin in a coup, the same color as cool whip
She foulish, with tacky pointers
She ain't nothing but a runner like Jackie Joinus

[Chorus]
That fitful hip
That spacial lick
That caught her while and now
She wanna get rip
Go ask your chick
Find out how I get down (damn)
It's gettin' in here (damn)
Act tough till the cops get here (damn)
I got the whole block in here (damn)
So you could get it hot in here

[Hook]
Let me see you movin, movin
Let me see you hit the floor
If you ain't with it, with it
Then you can hit the door

[Hook]
Let me see you movin, movin
Let me see you hit the floor
If you ain't with it, with it
Then you can hit the door
You know I'm so Bay wit' it
Athletics A's fitted
Thirty plus chain inches on me (on me)
I got that thang on me (on me)
I ain't one for the talk
When I pop a couple shots
That boy wanna flap on me (on me)
I got the twins involved
The twins were nice in size and they both got their hands on me (on me)
She's a runner and a ripper
Pro styled gel and beauty supplied slippers
Get your gear right, get your fist up
I'm talkin fahrenheit, ma, switch your switch up
Need to switch up, break bread
Another night, another hype, on the bay bridge
More purp, more pills, the basics (Go Go)
Now that's Bay shit

[Chorus]
That fitful hip
That spacial lick
That caught her while and now
She wanna get rip
Go ask your chick
Find out how I get down (damn)
It's gettin' in here (damn)
Act tough till the cops get here (damn)
I got the whole block in here (damn)
So you could get it hot in here

[Hook]
Let me see you movin, movin
Let me see you hit the floor
If you ain't with it, with it
Then you can hit the door

[Hook]
Let me see you movin, movin
Let me see you hit the floor
If you ain't with it, with it
Then you can hit the door
