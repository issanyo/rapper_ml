Let it go
Let the good take hold
I'm a brothah from the West
Who was blessed with a soul
Let me tell you 'bout a place
You probably don't know
We still live in Cali
Got a style cultural
We was
Known from the 60's
From panthers and hippies
Now were known for
Murders pimps and three-sixties
Side shows high speed chases too
And a crack epidemic that'l turn ya blue
And an Aids epidemic that can end ya too
It's the yay baby brothah and I thought you knew
Oakland to Vallejo
Vallejo to the Zay
The Zay to the Sko'
AKA as the Bay
Unique so to speak
In a whole lotta' ways
We hardly get the love 'cause we close to LA
We got our own slang
But everybody took it
Now we goin' dumb down the Ave drivin' crooked

Chorus:
This the way
In the Bay (in the Bay heyeyeyey)
In the Bay (heyeyeyey)
In the Bay (heyeyeyey)

In ya little kuddy cold from the Northern Pacific
Beach always cold
So don't get the game twisted
Thugs reprocessed to the death packin' biscuits
Weed almost legal the trees it's terrific
We got
Cannabis clubs
Filipinos and Blacks
Latinos from all over the map
Chinese and Vietnamese
So don't get jacked
Samoans Indians Tongans Thais
It's the Bay homie
And we multiplies
We never act shy when it's time to ride
And we claim 2 Pac as a source of pride
Said "we claim 2 Pac as a source of pride"
Let it go
Let me bless the flow my people
Here we go here we go here we here we yo
From the streets to the beach
Flat lands to peace
To the freaks in the deeps drivin’ by (beep beep)
To the heat 'neath the seat
To the cops from the beat
To the rich to the sweet
To the poor to the weak
To the youth and the beast
HP 3rd Street
(3 x’s) telegraph to the Ave
North to the deep East

To the youth and the beast
HP 3rd Street
Telegraph to the Ave
North to the deep East

Chorus:
This the way
In the Bay (in the Bay heyeyeyey)
In the Bay (heyeyeyey)
In the Bay (heyeyeyey)
