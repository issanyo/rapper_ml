[Chorus]
You must be used to me spending
And all that sweet wining and dining
I'm fucking you tonight
I'm fucking you tonight

[Verse]
I know ?, know something
(We) Usually, I cross stations for the face
Usually, it's going bottles in the V
And usually I ain't following back
But act usually, but to not even relax
Fuck all that extra [?]
Don't need no distractions
Bottom line I been missing
And without me you've been miserable
Drinks in the fridge propably cold
How long only time will tell
Might take a break from cloud smoke
Besides that I ain't got no time to chill
I can show you all kind of love
I did show how you were supposed to feel
Now I got you all posted up
Awesome Hennessy and some [?] beer

[Chorus]
You must be used to me spending
And all that sweet wining and dining
I'm fucking you tonight
I'm fucking you tonight

[Verse]
(Yeah) Drinking glasses, creeping
Know how you act off, drink
You jumping on it, deep in
Baby, you know I can't wait
As long as I got that fire
As long as I got that tree
You're the only thing I'm driving
Right now you know we ain't leave
'Cause I'm way past tipsy
You are all up in my way [?] whisky
Got me on my way [?]
With the song, I got a nigga all upon
We realing it, don't  chasing goals and dreams
Playboy, wardrobe, Roll's and watches
Nigga that [?] you anything
Used to the life, but tonight ain't happening, girl

[Chorus]
You must be used to me spending
And all that sweet wining and dining
I'm fucking you tonight
I'm fucking you tonight
