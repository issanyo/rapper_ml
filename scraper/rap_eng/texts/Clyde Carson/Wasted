Know you wanna fuck, know you wanna smoke
Know you wanna drink, know you wanna get wasted (wasted)
Get wasted (wasted), get wasted
Know you wanna fuck (huh), know you wanna smoke
Know you wanna drink, know you wanna get wasted (wasted)
Get wasted (wasted, flash), get wasted

[Verse 1: Ja'Ryan]
I'm only finna fuck if she painted her pussy pink
Only nigga in the town I got a song, Pushaz Ink
Boy I'm good from the P to the Bay to Long Beach
With my squad on and make sure we all eat, nigga
Yankees right behind me off that diesel in this muscle car and you ain't never prolly seen a lil nigga that punches hard
Stupid (huh), lil bro gon' punch him out, and nigga what the fuck you think these bitches always talkin' 'bout?
Honestly it's yabba-dabba-doo gang, nigga we the brand
Smokin' that sizzurp syrup, I need some' to lean against
Bitches always askin' me questions 'bout who I'm stickin' with
If it ain't you then bitch mind yo' business, the fuck you think this is?
(Huh), Bitch, fuck you thought this was?
Presidential rollie like a nigga fuckin' Ivanka Trump
You are not that bitch, I swear to God you not but you gon' run me out, you lil bitch
'Cause I...

Know you wanna fuck, know you wanna smoke
Know you wanna drink, know you wanna get wasted (wasted)
Get wasted (wasted), get wasted
Know you wanna fuck, know you wanna smoke
Know you wanna drink, know you wanna get wasted (uhh, wasted)
Get wasted (wasted, RJ), get wasted (look, On My Momma I'm On)

[Verse 2: RJmrLA]
Hey, girl I know you wanna fuck (fuck), and one time ain't enough
Let me get it up (get it up), need a lil more trust, and a lot more uhh
R, mother fuck her better when she off me
Hit 'em on, get a bean, no coffee
Fuck a queen on a king, went softie
Bought a Beam', now up, blue diamond
Damn it, you gon' be my addy
I'm gon' stuff my shit up in your attic
Fuck you on a hammock, automatic, now you need it (need it)
And every time you call, I'm in a meetin'
But I'm only eatin', and this is how it always goes
Me and the homies ran through a lotta these hoes (lotta these hoes)
You bet us once, let a part of their nose
Keep calm and come outta them clothes


[Hook: Clyde Carson & Young Gully]
Know you wanna fuck, know you wanna smoke
Know you wanna drink, know you wanna get wasted (wasted)
Get wasted (wasted), get wasted
Know you wanna fuck (huh), know you wanna smoke
Know you wanna drink, know you wanna get wasted (wasted)
Get wasted (wasted), get wasted

[Verse 3: Young Gully]
Wasted, load it off a fifth a hand
Pilly on my tongue, high enough to tell her get a friend
Fifty deep up in the spot, I done let my feelin's in
Killed my last hoe, now I'm goin' for the kill again
Six bottles on the table, it was all a trend (huh)
Bitches on my dick, I feel like Charlie Sheen (huh)
Spent like twelve hunnid on these bomber jeans
I got so much paper, homie I be causin' scenes (ooh)
Ass on my lap, man we on the map
Hoes wanna crash with the camp, I just wanna stamp
Bros they imperial, ayy man that's a miracle
Give her dick, now she singin' on me, that's a spiritual
God, really I'm just tryna milk her like she cereal
I be talkin' big shit, but I don't think they hear me though
We be gettin' drunk 'til we faint, that's a theory, bro
Halloween, glisten bitch, my diamonds got that eerie glow (oh)

[Hook: Clyde Carson & RJmrLA]
Fuck, know you wanna smoke
Know you wanna drink, know you wanna get wasted (wasted)
Get wasted (wasted), get wasted
Know you wanna fuck, know you wanna smoke
Know you wanna drink, know you wanna get wasted (wasted)
Get wasted (wasted), get wasted (On My Momma I'm On)
