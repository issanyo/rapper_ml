I got you feeling right at home
Like you've been on me
Got filled up with ice
What 's wrong with me?
All my niggas are with the bottles up
We can spare
She wanna know what you're talking about

If I could be a 'hoe
Let yourself go
California niggas rollin' up the best smoke
'All I know is to fly shit
Just let yourself go
Don't be afraid t jump off
Where you come from
If you wanna come in
Party away, I'm coming
You break it up on me
Make a nigga wanna go

Let me see back it up for me
Let me see back it up
I'm happy I got cash money
Girl back that ass up
And if you wanna play
We'll go home again

Double cup, feeling right
Truly, dirty sprite
She know the mood I like
I know what you do, won't let it slide
'the way it's going down
I know you want to cash it at night
Just for the patrol to get down
'Whatever you need, as we proceed
That's your cheese, stylin' on
Coe be wild with me
Don't be afraid t jump off
Where you come from
If you wanna come in
Party away, I'm coming
You break it up on me
Make a nigga wanna go

Let me see back it up for me
Let me see back it up
I'm happy I got cash money
Girl back that ass up
And if you wanna play
We'll go home again
Them panties coming, them panties coming
Them panties coming
Them panties coming, them panties coming
Them pnaties coming off
Back that thing, back that thing up
Back that thing, back that thing up
Back that thing, back that thing up
Back that thing, back that thing up
And them panties coming off

Let me see back it up for me
Let me see back it up
I'm happy I got cash money
Girl back that ass up
And if you wanna play
We'll go home again
And them panties are coming off
