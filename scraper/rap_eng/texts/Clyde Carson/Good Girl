Let's Go, Yea
The Team
Yea, I like this

[Clyde Carson & Kaz Kyzah]
You know them types of chicks man (You know them types of chicks man)
You know they be seeing ya holla at 'em (You see me talkin' to ya)
They know you talkin' to 'em
They be tryna act like they don't hear you

This is what I say to 'em...

[Clyde Carson]
Excuse me darlin'
Don't mean to brother
Not tryna irritate or start no problems
I ain't shoutin' at ya mama
I won't holla
Just whisper in your ear hopefully you'll folla
I know your type
Know that you won't tolerate
Hate them fake types, you won't call 'em
Won't take no date night
But you don't wanna
You don't want to
And that's why I'm on you

Now every time I see you, you playin' the role
Never let me holla she keep tellin' me no
Won't give me the time or day just roll
Right past your boy like she ain't know
But I say... (I don't ma, I'm just tryna holla at ya)

[Chorus 2X]
She's a good girl (But I can't tell)
Tryna act like a good girl (But I can't tell)
Got 'em all open man (I can't fail)
Can't fall for her man (That ain't trill)

[Kaz Kyzah]
Yea, I'd love to blush
Caress and sex ya
You feeling the pressure of another semester
Sitting through lectures from her professor
Gotta respect ya cause ya ain't like the rest of
Chicks with gestures
Just ta test ya
Just ta bless ya would be my pleasure
Sit you on leather
Soft buttered texture
God is good
But when I address you

Everytime I see you, you playin' the role
Never let me holla keep tellin' me no
Won't give me the time or day just roll
Right past your boy like you ain't know
So I say... (Come on)

[Chorus 2X]
She's a good girl (But I can't tell)
Tryna act like a good girl (But I can't tell)
Got 'em all open man (I can't fail)
Can't fall for her man (That ain't trill)

(I Like This)

[Repeat 4X]
Stop the games
Drop your name
Shoot your lil' number ma
Hop in the Range

Now this time I see you
You ain't playin' the role
Now you let me holla, you ain't tellin' me no
Wanna give me the time and day then roll
With me in the Range now you ready to go
But I say... (I dunno about now, I dunno)

[Chorus 2X]
She's a good girl (But I can't tell)
Tryna act like a good girl (But I can't tell)
Got 'em all open man (I can't fail)
Can't fall for her man (That ain't trill)

I don't even know why you playin' man
You can't even trust 'em either
Well at least The Team can

I like this... Team
