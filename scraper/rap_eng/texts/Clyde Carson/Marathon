[Chris Tucker fom movie Friday]
Need some young meat
Mr. Parker ain't hittin' that right man

Your man ain't hittin' that right
Hit-hittin' that right, hit-hit-hittin' that right
Your man ain't hittin' that right
Hittin' that right, hit-hit-hittin' that right

[Verse 1: Mistah F.A.B.]
I be runnin' that thing, Hussein
Kick the pussy walls down, Liu Kang
All-all balls deep like the hoop game
Stomp-stompin' in that pussy like a nuke man
Dick so dope, take it like meds
Pussy so good, but I like head
Michael Johnson, relay
She keep my arm strong with a BJ
Fucked me in the booth no DJ
Make her sell that fuckin' pussy on eBay
She-she think my dick on 'roids, Barry Bonds
'Cause she ain't never got fucked like a marathon
Got her drunk of Patrón and that Pérignon
As soon as I nutted, told her "Carry on"
She in love, tryna marry a nigga
And if her man find out, he'll try to bury a nigga

[Chorus]
Your man ain't hittin' that right
Hit-hittin' that right, hit-hit-hittin' that right
Your man ain't hittin' that right
If you give me that pussy, I'll be in it all night
I'll run a marathon in that thing
I'll run a marathon in that thing
I'll run a marathon in that thing
I'll run a marathon in that thing

[Verse 2: Clyde Carson]
She said "I'm new to the game, bitch, where you been?" (Where you been?)
Legend in the Bay, ho, where you live? (Where you live?)
Nieman Marcus shoppin', bitch, where you spend? (You spend)
This Bentley Cooper's off the lot, ho, what you in? (What you in?)
Slap Parvati (Parvati), least go tens (Least go tens)
Hear me comin' up the block in my truck or my Benz (Truck or my Benz)
I'm turnin' up, just when you thought that you was gonna win
I burn up, light a Swisher Sweet up at the end
They say supersonic (Supersonic), Goose and tonic (Goose and tonic)
On me, cookies must be that super chronic (Super chronic)
Car'll got a nigga rich, super stuntin'
Got her eyes on my arm and she's super on it (Super on it)
Disrespectful trife (Trife), got her in your life (Life)
We take that bitch home, 'cause we out here for the night
Mind's gettin' lost when you blinded by the light (Light)
Hypnotize every time when I put on my ice

[Chorus]
Your man ain't hittin' that right
Hit-hittin' that right, hit-hit-hittin' that right
Your man ain't hittin' that right
If you give me that pussy, I'll be in it all night
I'll run a marathon in that thing
I'll run a marathon in that thing
I'll run a marathon in that thing
I'll run a marathon in that thing

[Verse 3: E-40]
Where you at, is paradise compared to where I'm at (Where I'm at)
In the thick of the trap, get your helmet pushed back (Pushed back)
If you're second, then you're last man, you lost (Lost)
Lay a bitch nigga down like a table cloth (Table cloth)
You can find me, up at Safeway at three in the morning, hella blitzed (Blitzed)
Aisle six, buyin' a box of condoms and some chips
Where you want to stay? The La Quinta or the Extended Stay (Extended stay)
From LA, but I met her up at Yoshi's in the Bay
[?] when I saw her
Mack game (Mack game), power (Power)
She was fuckin' with a pimp, she knew I wasn't a simp
After a couple of sips (What'd she do?)
She started to vent (She said)
"My man ain't never here and he don't take me nowhere
And guess what? I ain't wearin' underwear"
I said "Hold that thought (Hold that thought), bookmark that (Bookmark that)"
Say no more (Say no more), bitch let's scat (Bitch let's scat)
Biatch!

[Chorus]
Your man ain't hittin' that right
Hit-hittin' that right, hit-hit-hittin' that right
Your man ain't hittin' that right
If you give me that pussy, I'll be in it all night
I'll run a marathon in that thing
I'll run a marathon in that thing
I'll run a marathon in that thing
I'll run a marathon in that thing
