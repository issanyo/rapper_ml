Got a bar in my living room
Just in case I gotta get more into you
But knocking on my hoes, in this world I do my interviews
Did I mention that I sent a few young magnificent with tree on deck
Slap on the slash but we on next

Kill shit, leave the track D.O.A
Some peach sirock or prolly some pink rose

[Hook]
Won't get far on hating shit
You never get far
Let's move forward on some player shit
Meet me by the bar
Pour up, pour up, pour up
Pour up some drank for me
Roll up, roll up now
Roll up some purp for me

Late night with your bottom bitch
Out of pocket and she just acknowledged it
Every conversation she has, I'm the top again
Bout time we holler then fall through the bill
Right on time, diamonds in my watch and on my right arm
Maybe jordans or louis vuitton
I'm feeling important, life of a don

[Hook]

On the case getting sideways
Loaded on the highway, got out from the club
Now we headed my driveway
Bout to have it my way, 4 in the morning we still on
After this shit she don't wanna go back home
Moving, never alone, I gotta sell em a dream, I can't sell my soul

[Hook]
