Yeah!
Champagne popping, I'm a ballin ass nigga
Never slow down, ain't no stolen ass nigga
Always hell of busy, can't call 'em ass nigga
At the mall ass nigga, polo drawers ass nigga
Still chasing money, I'm a trapping ass nigga
When it don't work, make it happen ass nigga
Wins no losses, I'm a champ ass nigga
Ain't no random ass nigga, get it, handled ass nigga!
Grateful every morning that the Lord woke me up
Living every day like my last
I just want the cars with the door raised up
Two twenty five on the dash
Ain't no days off and we grind all year
Three sixty five on the grind
Money getting counted, yeah, that's all I am
Blowing up, smoke in the ride

[Hook]
Champagne popping, we're some ballin ass niggas
There where we show up, we'll be snatching all them bitches
Everyday we go hard, everybody is a witness
Every night flashing lights everybody want a picture
Champagne popping, we're some ballin ass niggas
Champagne popping, we're some ballin ass niggas
Champagne popping, we're some ballin ass niggas
Ballin ass niggas, ballin, ballin ass niggas!
I ain't escaping them products, blowing this for manana
Trying to stack at the same time, escape for your honor
Do with the drama, just focused on K
Whole crew is piranhas, and you're looking like bait
Yeah, I'm focused on power, they say money is the source
Black out on a beat, then we go pop a cork
Sipping, sipping champagne just to celebrate the game
Had our ups and downs, but my niggas still remain
Bottle after bottle on the floor thrown up
Living every day like my last
I just want the cars with the door raised up
Two twenty five on the dash
Ain't no days off and we grind all year
Three sixty five on the grind
Money getting counted, yeah, that's all I am
Blowing up, smoke in the ride

[Hook]
Champagne popping, we're some ballin ass niggas
There where we show up, we'll be snatching all them bitches
Everyday we go hard, everybody is a witness
Every night flashing lights everybody want a picture
Champagne popping, we're some ballin ass niggas
Champagne popping, we're some ballin ass niggas
Champagne popping, we're some ballin ass niggas
Ballin ass niggas, ballin, ballin ass niggas!
Three sixty five stay on the grind
Money on the table, on my mind
Smoking on the best shit all the time
All the time, all the time
Three sixty five stay on the crime
Money on the table, on my mind
Smoking on the best shit all the time
All the time, all the time

[Hook]
Champagne popping, we're some ballin ass niggas
There where we show up, we'll be snatching all them bitches
Everyday we go hard, everybody is a witness
Every night flashing lights everybody want a picture
Champagne popping, we're some ballin ass niggas
Champagne popping, we're some ballin ass niggas
Champagne popping, we're some ballin ass niggas
Ballin ass niggas, ballin, ballin ass niggas!
