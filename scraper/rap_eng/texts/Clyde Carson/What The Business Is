[Intro: Master P]
Eastwood, Clyde Carson, and Master P
What's the business, (Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Hook: Clyde Carson]
Stay on my shit, stay on my chips
We never switch, just holler what the business is
I’m tryna get whatever I can, whenever I can
Just holler what the business is
Everybody know why you came here, girl
Yeah, what the business is
We ain’t got time, can’t play no more
What the business is

[Verse 1: Master P]
Stay on my chips, stay on this gold
Stay on these streets, stay on these hoes
Stay on these niggas, stay on these blocks
No limit forever, we all we got
Stay in the club, stay with that heat
OG person, all the bad bitches with me
And I would be drinking if it make them sing
Million dollar vodka, made the world say uhm
Dragged my name through the mud, TMZ and I’m back
Too many zeros, my pockets be fat
You niggas be hating ‘cause your bitches be watching
I see that Ralph Lauren but I’m draping Versace
Hating niggas gonna get them licks
Bad bitches gonna shake them hips
My partners gonna grow like molds
Y’all niggas gonna hate like hoes

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Eastwood]
Eastwood! I got a Mayweather flow, bet I knock it out
I got the armies with me and they from the south
Top down music, selling word of mouth
LA, LA be the city and your shit will drop
Bitches rolling up, said it’s time to blow
Split a red, split it up, hey, you tryna smoke
All I know is money, pussy, power, respect
Couple bands on the stripper if she fucking the set
Hey, we ain’t gotta bump, girl, just give me neck
Get these suckers, get the trippers, you should take
These real live rappers, get you to make a statement
While them other niggas hate on my spot, ain’t no replacing that
Stay on my shit, that goes to be the whip
I heard she flip, I’m yelling what the business is
I stay on my tip, my niggas all trip
The bloods and the cribs, I’m yelling boo, what the business is

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Master P]
Cooler than them other niggas
Shake your ass if you fucking with me
Blowing bomb at the compound
Pair of shoe fly when I hop out
Do what the fuck I feel, do what the fuck I want
If you let them there, put you right on that sucker bus
Ain’t going for that ride
Me? I prefer to drive
Might not come in the club and be on time
They sense, my nigga, like the got nothing to lose
Living it up for all my niggas is down
Get you the gang so we can vote for the crown
I shine on these niggas, shine on these niggas
And the bass so many he dying on me, nigga
Miles on my soda, just crying on me, nigga
Gunshots, ambulance, shooting sirens for a nigga
What’s the signs for a nigga nowadays to make

[Hook]
