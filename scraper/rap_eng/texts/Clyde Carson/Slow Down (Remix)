I tell em
Slow down, you know you can't catch me
I move too fast on the gas, don't chase me
Slow down, slow down

[Verse 1: Clyde Carson]
(I tell 'em)
Ay, I'm on the case gettin' sideways
Dolla fo' five on the highway
You know a nigga state to state
On a dolo mission I got a date with the cake
Wide awoke, 3 A.M
Prolly touch down when the sun come in
Ay, when them guards hit the gate I be tired as fuck after that 8-hour race
I come from the land where we swing our cars
Figure 8 Benz concrete leave marks
Call it paid, super-charged
Back to back race the Benz with the four door Porsche
I'm tearin' up tires in this luxury
Hella smoke says she wanna fuck with me
Money on my mind ain't nothin' for free
Tryna keep up with me but it's nothin' to me

[Verse 2: Problem]
What!!
I’m on the gas goin' loco
Think you fly, shit I’m flyer like a promo
Used to throw bomb call me romo
The whip coming me with the horses like polo
Giddy up
Compton my city up
Big ballin’ on your team we like 50 up (yeah)
Tell your coach call time out
Thought your shit was on point
Till I bought mines out(yeah)
Vvvvrom on a nigga
Tryna play me dirty pull the broom on a nigga
Street sweepers squad banging like 6 speakers
Pull a bitch here's 3 pairs like 6 sneakers
Niggas smashin' like crunch time
Jersey niggas gettin' lost in my punch line (where you at)
Ha ha - ha ha
Yeah shit funny though
Don’t know what come faster my bitches or money (what!!!)

[Verse 3: Iamsu]
Suzy baby
Ciroc got me woozy baby
Beat this fuckin' beat up till I hear something excruciatin'
Model bitches choose me lately
I’m be passin' on em in the whip, I’m going like 180
I be smashin' on em (hey, slow down)
They love my style
They scream for my team, mayne they all go wild
Comin' straight out of the bay, where it all goes down
Mayne that sucker shit is dead fuck all those clowns
I'm with Carson and caz and a truck full of broads and some cash
Tell em slow down like they trynna be last
It’s all on a bitch they think I’m trynna be last
Young G, I’m countin' money in class
I’m addicted to somethin'
Need a whip with some buttons
To start my engine
Don’t play like we in detention or somethin'
Every verse is retarded
My brain is missin' or somethin'
And all I know is the money
I’m on a mission or somethin' AYE!!!
