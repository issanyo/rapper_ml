[Verse 1: Clyde Carson]
Call me the dopest, or just say the flow is
Too much for the world, the pearl diamond of Oakland
The movement of your girl when she curled off of the potion
Maybe it's the way that she twirls, you love the motion
It's really not a challenge for me, it's hocus pocus; magic
Poof, the shit you can get from rapping
The feeling of "I made it", yeah, sometimes I have it
I wouldn't even call this work, it's more like practice
More of a habit, easy as acting
Playing the role with passion, I'm catching what you been lacking
I MC for a living, 1, 2, I make it happen
Brain on drugs, the egg I've been cracking
They been asking, so I let em see it
Look what I did, they telling me that they need it
Right now I'm living it, right now you dreaming
Right now I'm killing it, it's beautiful, can't you see it?

[Hook: Goapele]
Plant a seed, watch it grow
Water, sun, lie and flow
You got it so, so
Plant a seed, watch it grow
Water, sun, lie and flow
You got it so, so

[Verse 2: Clyde Carson]
Call me your favourite, maybe I was made for it
Well, who knows so the moment might as well savor it
I went from hungry to food from all the catering
And have to blow these bitches fake kisses, maybe it's Maybeline
They same my name is King Crunk Clyde Carson
Switching the flow from every style you start with
They try to follow like the cycles walking through darkness
If I don't speak then they don't eat, so what would you call this?
Maybe a blessing, maybe a lesson
Class on class, don't get it then keep guessing
Picasso on the paintings, you niggas is just sketching
I ain't even got started my nigga, I'm just stretching
So come test em, I promise you fasho
To write, cut the records and cut the flow
See I bust records, you know how I let it go
The sickest shit you heard, it's beautiful, ain't it though?

[Hook: Goapele]

[Verse 3: Clyde Carson]
Call me the bestest, obvious I'm the freshest
Talk of the town, the crown, I accept it
The greatest of the greatest, I'm proud they respect it
And how I mix that hood shit with the sounds, that's eclectic
Hieroglyphics, style is prolific
So casual, style is so mischief
I let them pass it down, now I'm so gifted
Just addicted to the life that I found with no vision
Eyes closed it, standing behind the cop stopper
Middle of the East where them cops is ducking the choppers
I could, see the birth of my window, they in that chopper watching
Any lil' nigga that's busting eyes on the block and clocking
I got it popping, first with The Team
Respect ain't really coming 'till the juice at the scene
They been waiting for the solo, know I came for the ring
I'm just a young mobile moving, ain't it beautiful man?
