[Intro: J12 (Starting Six)]
It’s J12, the dj that is, starting 6, on your bitch
Ah, tpe, saucy in this thang
Turn up, the bay is back
(Get Ghost) (Get Ghost)

[Verse 1: Big Steve]
You can call me getting ghost, I swear you can’t see me
Puffin on a big ass blunt full of sea weed
Mama on deck, got her waiting for the text
My late night thing, gotta love her for the neck
Riding round town, hella high down the 80
Slap that shit, watch your girls go crazy
It’s not what it is man, it’s really what it do
It’s a party, it’s a party, whole team coming through
You can call me getting ghost

[Verse 2: Goose]
And I’m feeling like casper, yeah there’s 50 hollows in the back
Never act up
Plus I’m freshing up, light a blunt and I’m phantom
Call me Patrick Swayze, I’m an ace baby
What’s happening, what’s packing
I’m just ghosting, yoke in the whip, blow a smoke
Looking toasted
Smoother than the smoothest, colder than the coolest
Never see me twice, stay mark, keep it moving

[Hook: Sage The Gemini]
Get ghost, you move too slow, I’m invisible
Bitch I thought you knew
Tell em, get ghost, get ghost, get ghost
Get ghost, get ghost, get ghost
Argh, I’m a life between, hoes following me
I just tell em get ghost like halloween
Tell em, get ghost, get ghost, get ghost
Get ghost, get ghost, get ghost

[Verse 3]
Dala 45 ain’t fast enough, 4 new cars keep adding up
Just coped no trade in, no deal living like I made it
1000, what the fuck is that?
I made that yesterhour
Think I’m sellin product, 4 crossing on a beat
They turn it up louder
Team banging motto hollow tips for them cowards
Prada & BVC and some Louis, my whole wardrobe is a movie
Never skip a doobie, put the molly in the champagne
And watch it do the foolie
Slow down, making a mess, tearing up the streets in my brand new vet
Free my nigga PS, the original driver, yeah
But I got next

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Sage The Gemini]
Ah, I’m a bay boy, with a double [?]
I only fuck with bad twins, give me double [?]
If you ain’t footballing I’ma fumble you
If you don’t get that mula, with me cover’s blown
She a freak yeah, freak for the freaking nature
Your man mad you freak here freaking head
Pop out cause when I’m popular, I’am pop you later
If she ain’t with the Schwarzenegger
Then I’mma terminate her
Black money, black money yeah Obama wins
My shirts cost more than your mama get
I’m looking like a compliment
While you, you lookin like the opposite
Ah, get ghost like after hours
I get your girlfriend wet even after showers
Might fuck her even after powers
I fuck her hour until she British bitch I’m Austin Powers

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
I’m with the 6, ho you better get
Ghost, giving them haters goose bumps with my cold flows
We in the traffic, with the doors, open swanging
Getting her wet and banging
And the hoes line up when I ride through the [?]
Eyes hella low and I ain’t talking bout Chinese
Finna walk on the game, watch my shoes break the concrete
Finna hit hard, real hard like boxing

[Verse 6]
Speakers turnt doing donuts in your residence
Black tenants, I be riding like the president
And she really nasty than every nigga I know can hit
Smash it than I vanish, 50 soldiers like a magic trick
You can get a couple of friends, and y’all can fuck with us
And you can get the fuck out the hotel and catch the bus
I put it on ya, then shot glasses pass to the corner
Then come back round it’s like karma

[Hook]
