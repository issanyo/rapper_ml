[Intro]
Smoke (x7)

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Smoking the weed, we rollin' the finest of trees
Cannabis indica leaves
Light it up, pass it here please
Smokin' this OG, I don't know nothin' 'bout no seeds
Blow like the breeze, high as a whole flock of geese
A couple QP's what I need
Might as well bring the whole P 'cause we light it up all day
And smoke when we wanted on leaves [?]
Blazin' on nothin' but A.1
So high I'm lookin' down at the sun
Smoke up an ounce in an hour for fun
Smoke with me, you're gonna forget where you're from
Higher than a kite, I smoke like a chimney all night
OD on kush, I just might
All I need is a light, smokers unite

[Hook]
Smokers united, now roll up and light it
Smokers united, now roll up and light it
Smokers unite, now roll up and light
I'm feeling so righteous as smokers unitin', smoke

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What in the hell is you doing?
You smokin' that reggie, my boy is you trippin'?
No wonder when we don't get down like that
Who you kiddin' this shit is forbidden!
Snake in the grass, this thing made of wax
And to hit it, you need my permission
Trippy stay loaded, one hundred
Gon' come on, get trippy
I don't plan on quitting, (no sir!)
Twisting the 'woods, thick as a rope
Shit is so sticky, the grinder is broke
Not for no children, it's just for adults
Covered in kief, call that a fur coat
Lit like a candle, it never go out
Like a satellite 'bout to take flight
That commercial weed is all hype
OG is my type, smokers unite

[Hook]
Smokers united, now roll up and light it
Smokers united, now roll up and light it
Smokers unite, now roll up and light
I'm feeling so righteous as smokers unitin'

[Verse 3: Clyde Carson]
Aye, California Kings
As far as weed, nigga, we're the Medell√≠n
Grow the best shit on Earth
Cookies, OG chronic purp'
Niggas send that diesel to the east coast
Hit me back when you need more
I'll be on 50th in East Oakland
Big mama house eatin' soul food
Nigga I grew up 'round the dealers and the dope heads
Where we turned scooters into mopeds
Up the block hear the motor
See me coming 'round the corner
Can't sue me, I'm Clyde Carson
Now the top is off, bumpin' Too $hort and 2Pacalypse
If we all unite, ain't no stopping us
Zags, Swishers, Woods yeah we got 'em all, smoke

[Hook x2]
Smokers unite, now roll up and light
Smokers united, now roll up and light it
Smokers united, now roll up and light it
I'm feeling so righteous as smokers unitin', smoke
Smokers united, now roll up and light it
Smokers united, now roll up and light it
Smokers unite, now roll up and light
I'm feeling so righteous as smokers unitin', smoke
