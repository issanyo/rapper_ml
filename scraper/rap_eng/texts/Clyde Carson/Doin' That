[Intro/Hook]
Boy if you a baller then you know me
Girl if you a stunna then you know me
I'm living that life of a young OG
And everybody doin' that
See me doin' that

[Verse 1: Clyde Carson]
I'm in my whip, I'm in my ride
Superstar stuntin' with them stunnaz on my eyes
I'm in my new fit, I'm so fly
They staring at the hard top as I ride by
Got money to the sky cus my lifestyle true
Been doing it for years but my lifestyle new
The watch, the jewels, the yachts, the pools
The million dollar home on a dock with the views, I'mma
Young schizo, same young flip dough
And ever since I signed my deal every chick a nympho
Broke niggas krypto, Haters give me energy
I flow a lil' schizo, maniass memory
Million dollar baby, rich from the hood dough
Twenty on the piece, still up in the hood stove
Rookies I can teach, call this shit a hood show
Your homies can't compete, cus I've been giving the hood dough

[Verse 2: Clyde Carson]
Piece in my lap as I mob with the crew
It's mo' dough so you know how mob niggas do
I'm Dolo so you know I'm high when I cruise
I'm high when I choose, I fly when I move
High speak while I roll through the town brand new
My brother said sid top down passed through
We stop, we roll, the cops patrol
But they can't do nothing just for stuntin', let us go, got the
Town Locked up, Clique hit the block up
With every nigga in the whip shift out, rocked out
Step out, hop up, chainz on in front of me
Youngsters in the hood, on the block where the burners be
Maine got a bumbelbee, candy yellow lambo
Famous from the dance, everybody let your hands go
Rubber band grands, pocket full of cash flow
Pimpin' I'm the man, never seen the cash low

[Hook]
Boy if you a baller then you know me
Girl if you a stunna then you know me

And everybody doin' that
