Uh yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Sho-nuff
Team, Bottles up
Put em up, yeah
Team, Carson
Talk to 'em

[Clyde Carson]
I've been patiently waiting
Pacing the pavement
Plotting out how to put your face in the placement
Something I could play with
Something I could lay with
Ma I'm in the club I could find a replacement
Every club, every city we go
Gots to knock something when we out on the road
We got so many hoes from head to toe
Nothing but dimes and time to get some mo'
Trust me, they all love our style
They scream for Team they all go wild
And dream and cream
They flock in piles
Here we in the club we see 'em come for miles
From East Side Oakland to the bottoms in the west
We see who could sideshow, swing and ride best
So fresh Team is a household name
Nothing but hot boys in a club full of dames

Ripped in the club
Stay in the club, stay in the club (Yea)
Bottles Up
Get ripped in the club (Team)
Stay in the club, stay in the club (Yea)
Bottles Up
Get ripped in the club (Team)
Ripped in the club (Team) Ripped in the club (Team)
Bottles Up (Yea) Bottles Up (Yea)
Get ripped in the club

Now check my styles
How I gets down
I gets 'round
I rep Town
How my clique clown
Team niggas is fools
Got light, got yurple, whatever you choose
Checkin' the shoes
Ape's is bathing
Green and gold, like the A's is playing
I put it in layman's for suckers who lame men
They don't understand this Oakland slanguage
World Premiere been keep 'em waitin'
But I'm back now for you ho-harbors and havens
Wan' call your clique over like call waiting
Staring at a stunna, that's stargazing
Fact remaining, we got it game
Hoes wanna say my name, say my name (Kyzah)
I take you mane straight to Maine
What he do? And fuck her down face to frame
Face the lame
