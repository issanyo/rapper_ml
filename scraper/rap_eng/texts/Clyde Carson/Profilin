[Verse 1]
Fair [?]
Trinkin' some out the bottle
I had 'em follow
Me and my niggas to the condo
Smokin' top shelf pod [?]
[?]
Brought the box out
Still on sixers
Caught them lookin' when I hopped out
I'mma giant
8P perfect timing
Grinding'
Under, with the [?]
Had a chance with me, but they passed on me
[?] with 200 on the dashboard
Know it, if I say it, I'mma stand on it
Fuck it, know who you can't wait to get your hands on

[Chorus]
I got it
Is whatever that you need, it's no problem
On the strip, profilin'
Push the pedal
Hear the tires just howlin'
I got dough, honey more
She actin' like she ready
All in love, but it's only with the [?]
Keep it in the [?]
Put some money where my [?] me
Tipsy, awesome H-Juice and some Codeine

[Verse 2]
(Yeah)
In the projects
Fresh out [?], right to some mob shit
What's the object
Get as much dough, as I can fit inside my pockets
In the friend zome
Must have beeen the Benz or why [?]
In the end zone
Running up the points, if we start, we gonna finish it
I'm amazing
Pull up
New interior and paint
Dangerous
Look out, 'cause she [?]
I figured they was mad, 'cause I heard they [?]
She knows that when she hear that ain't hurtin' me
Dope shit
That's why you gonna learn for me
And tonight she just wanna burn with me

[Chorus]
I got it
Is whatever that you need, it's no problem
On the strip, profilin'
Push the pedal
Hear the tires just howlin'
I got dough, honey more
She actin' like she ready
All in love, but it's only with the [?]
Keep it in the [?]
Put some money where my [?] me
Tipsy, awesome H-Juice and some Codeine
