[Verse 1: Keith Dixon]

Tell me this
How long you been celibate
And would you give it up
For the hell of it
Got damn
Ass like that round
Hands up tops down
How's that sound?
Your boys a fool
All white black shades
Like he's too cool
Laid back
Something like a Maybach
Pulling up like
Nigga where they make that
I shine
Hotter than the summertime
Nailing these hoes in the back
Like a hammer time [gone]
And this that money flow
Everybody pointing at your boy
Like there he goes
Damn times is hard
How I get by with a roof so soft [clean]
Full price I tell her take half off
I got my pants off

[Chorus]

Is she with it?
Really really with it
I ain't spending money if she ain't fucking with it
Bad girl real bad girl
Breaking niggas pockets like it's her world
She's a bad girl real bad girl
Bad girl real bad girl
She's a
Bad girl real bad girl
Breaking niggas pockets like it's her world

[Verse 2: Clyde Carson]

B.A.D. B.A.D
I filler up with some Hennessy and THC
Money on my mind ain't got my fee
Call my phone all she's hear is at&t
I go bad go mainey but I stay on fresh
Loud in the air we won't we won't stress
Dawg ass hoes go stay on fresh
I'm the east coast cross country lax
I took a trip to England
To visit the queen
She brought presents
I brought me
I told her stories of loyalty
I'm knocking bitches
Even old ones in royalty
Ride around town
In my clean ass cars
My nigga got the Bentley
And the SLR
All got stables on big ass farms
Our very own lil bad girls
Club At home now

[Chorus]


[Verse 3]

It's obvious
More money acknowledgement
I'm the next to blow
I'm in her head like a neurologist
She's acting like she want me
She just wants to fuck with all of us
And Drew da Beast has helped
To get these weak bitches up off of us
Wait a second
I don't fuck with gimmicks
If she's on the team
Then I push her to the limits [push]
Heels on
Throw that ass back
Make that ass clap
She want it acting like she got it
Knowing them shoes she got on
That nigga bought it
Paparazzi girl hot as wasabi
Found out who I was
Then sucked me up
In the lobby
Double dose of her medicine
She's the kind of girl
Who knows the shooter
And she'll let 'em in
I know she feeling it
And I ain't worried
Bout my next Check
Cuz I'm killing shit

[Chorus] x2
