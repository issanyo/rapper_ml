[Chorus]
Suicides
I like you ride, thanks
Homicides, killer
You know my kind, ray
Cellphones, lit
She comin' home, with me
That's my brother, please
Show him some love, thanks

[Verse]
Rockin' some rocks on my left and right wrist
Knockin' 'em out, like I'm Tyson
On a roll, nigga you pickin' a fight with
Knowin' your ? and she like this
I heard ?
I heard she missin' me, cite me
Come to my show, if you wanna recite this
Pussy is tight as a vice grip
Stop at a store, stop for some weed
Try'na get high, try'na get seen
Anger my doll, I'm like a scene
She not callin' back, she runnin' with me
Takin' advantage of life is a privilege
This money more, then let me handle my business
I knocked her outta 24, outta fitness
Still shinin', nigga summa is endless
Lookin' like Newman
I know what to do
Stay on my way
Keep it on cruise

[Chorus]
Suicides
I like you ride, thanks
Homicides, killer
You know my kind, ray
Cellphones, lit
She comin' home, with me
That's my brother, please
Show him some love, thanks
