(Mustard on the beat, hoe)

[Verse 1:]
I got you feelin’ right at home (right at home)
Like you been on me
Cup filled up with ice
Zoned out, blowin' strong with me
All my niggas brought the bottles out
Yo, we came to spend
She wanna know what I’m talkin' 'bout
If I could let her in
Be yourself, hoe
Just let yourself go
California niggas rollin' up the best smoke
My collar up with some friends and a fresh coat
All I know is fly shit
Let yourself go

[Chorus 1:]
Don't be afraid to jump off
Way you come off
I can tell you wanna go in
Pardon the way I come off
Way you back it up on me
Make a nigga wanna go ham

[Chorus 2:]
Ain't no kissin' in the club if you love me
Let me see you back it up
I’m a hot boy, I got cash money
Go back that ass up
Well, if you’re willing to go home and play (well, let’s gooo)
Well if you’re willing to go home and play (got them panties coming off)

[Verse 2:]
Double cup, fill 'em right
Two liter, dirty sprite
She know how to move the way I like
I know what to do, won’t let her slide
Couple photos now, the way it’s going down
I know you wanna cash it tonight
Just wait till the Patron go down
Champagne go 'round
As far as drugs baby I got your vice
Whatever you need, as we proceed
Do it big like Lil' Cease, bless without the sneeze
Bread, extra cheese
Stylin' on 'em
Look in her eyes, ready to wild on me

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge:]
Got them panties coming [x2]
Got them panties coming off
Got them panties coming [x2]
Got them panties coming off
Back that thing, back that thing up [x4]
Got them panties coming off

[Chorus 2]
