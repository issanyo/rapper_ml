[Chorus: Clyde Carson & Boofrmda4]
Swear I'll always be right by your side
(By your side, baby, by your side)
Yeah, I'll always be right there for you
(Be right there, for you)
Yeah, you need a real one that's gon' hold you down
(Hold you down) (That's gonna hold you down, yeah)
(Hold you down)
Is you ready for the real thing?
(Are you ready for (yeah) a real one?)
Is you ready for the real thing? (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Clyde Carson]
Ooooh, you know what you deserve, huh?
'Bout that action, just can't hit you with them words, huh?
All that "what’s your name" shit is for the birds, huh?
That’s exactly how a nigga get curved, huh?
Not me tho, not how I move
Whole different kind of approach: the type that you approve
Whole different type of way: you know how I pursue
I got you, but it’s what you wanna do

[Chorus]
Swear I'll always be right by your side
(By your side, baby, by your side)
Yeah, I'll always be right there for you
(Be right there, for you)
Yeah, you need a real one that's gon' hold you down
(Hold you down) (That's gonna hold you down, yeah)
(Hold you down)
Is you ready for the real thing?
(Are you ready for (yeah) a real one?)
Is you ready for the real thing? (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Boofrmda4]
Say, say you want a real one, come roll with me
Different locations, where you wanna be?
I can take you around the world, what you wanna see?
And I can promise you anywhere you wanna be
Have you ever met a real one get down like that?
See me and my crew, we get down like that
And I don't switch up or get down like that
Do you have someone that's gon' ride like that?

[Chorus]
Swear I'll always be right by your side
(By your side, baby, by your side)
Yeah, I'll always be right there for you
(Be right there, for you)
Yeah, you need a real one that's gon' hold you down
(Hold you down) (That's gonna hold you down, yeah)
(Hold you down)
Is you ready for the real thing?
(Are you ready for (yeah) a real one?)
Is you ready for the real thing? (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge: Clyde Carson]
(Yeah)
Love fuckin' with a gangsta (fuckin' with a gangsta)
'Cause you know that I'm the truth (know that I'm the truth)
Put way too much work in (yeah)
For me to ever ever lose (ever ever lose)
Follow my lead, baby (follow my lead)
Show you what's good (show you what's good)
You ain't gotta look no further (no, no)

[Chorus]
