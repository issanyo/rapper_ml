[Chorus:]
Ahh
Nah, I know
What to say to get ya hands up
And I know
When you hear this you gon' stand up
In the club blowin' dro
In the middle of the dance flo'
Now everybody let your hands go
Don't hold back mama move (move)
This right here the new groove (groove)
So easy and so smooth (smooth)
We can get loose, just
Put down ya drinks so we can 2 step

Hit the club with my stunnas on
Baby, I came to party, who you rubbin' on?
Rock with me in the comfort zone
You know that 1, 2 step
With the left, right, with the rhythm, go
Move like ya want it with me
Whether poppin' bottles with ballers in the V.I.P
Throwin' shots of patron, perkin' with the P.Y.T's
Know they perfect, pimp, I ain't searchin'
You should know my speed
I got the baddest in the spot with a pimp
Peep how I'm rockin' and I dip with a limp
You know the 2 step cooler
Got a drink take a sip
And you can snap ya fingers while ya movin' to this
Come and holla at me mommy, you hot
I've been lookin' at you since you walked in the spot
I've got a fly spot downtown, Oakland up top
And we can get together after this if you want

[Chorus]

Heh, if you with me you can feel the groove
Rockin' like grown folks from the old school (old school)
Clyde Carson ain't a old dude
But I heard I taste good like sofo (hehe)
Ahh, I came to get my drink on
All the club filled up with women who get they creep on
Wonder how many it fill up into the suite room
Take the handcuff off ya girl
She be with me, go (Ahh, yeah)
Outta there, blowin' some grapes
Now tell the DJ to go look in the crates
Pull them records out to make you put that look on your face
You know that, you know that
You know that look when you say
Been waitin' for this here cus' it's been a long time since I
Uhh, got down from the back to the front
Got the whole crowd steppin' like Kelly
So come
We get it jumpin' in the club
But we ain't gotta go dumb

[Chorus]

Ahh, rock with me to the left when you steppin', just
Let ya hands go and just 2 step
Ahh, rock with me to the right when you steppin', just
Let yourself go and just 2 step
Now just dip, dip, dip, dip
Let ya hands go and just 2 step
Now just dip, dip, dip, dip
Let yourself go and just 2 step

[Chorus]

Just 2 step
Just 2 step
Just 2 step
Just 2 step
