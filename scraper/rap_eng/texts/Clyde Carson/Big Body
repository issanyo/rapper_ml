[HOOK: BOBBY BRACKINS & TY$]
Rolling up kill hot box in a box in a big body
Got a bad thick bitch, up in the big body
I'm a get me some pussy, up in the big body
Leave the function hella on start pushing a big body
Big body, we mob in the big body
Big body, we mob in the big body
Big body, we mob in the big body
Big body, we mob in the big body

[VERSE 1: BOBBY BRACKINS]
I'm pushing the whip shawty, I give you the dick shawty
Just give me your grip shawty, then you can rich shawty
On text with E-40, on calls with Too $hort
I want to live good and ball like Kukoc
The town girl the town girl, where it goes down girl
I want to get cake get cake, give me pound girl
Cruising in a big thing, hogging up the road
Blowing on a chopper looking out for po'
Real niggas do real things baby
I beat it up in the back seat baby
I send you home in a taxi baby
Big body Benz or a Cadi baby

[VERSE 2: CLYDE CARSON]
4G autos holding up an S5
Bought it cash didn't even test drive
Live life fast like I'm out of Bed-Stuy
Cut the top off so all you see is sky
We headed out of town, keep the weed man on sight
You know its one in every hood like White Mike
AP you got on yo wrist is quite bright
That big body we sitting in is quite nice (Yeah)
Real nigga doing real things baby
I beat it up in my glass house baby
I send you home in a taxi baby
Big body Benz or a Cadi baby

You can have her I just want to fuck one time
Pushaz ink the label bitch we making big deals
Big body and its sitting on big wheels
Big booty man that's got to be butt shots

Big body Benz or the Cadi baby
