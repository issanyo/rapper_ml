(C.T. Beats)

[Verse 1:]
Ay, nigga I had to get it (had to get it)
Bein' broke as fuck had me sick (had me sick)
My nigga worked a 9-to-5 but had to quit (had to quit)
Trappin' the only thing that made some sense (made some sense)
Now, could you blame a nigga who really was tryna' do right (tryna' do right)
They walk over you when you try to be nice (try to be nice)
Couldn't do the simp shit ?
'Cus me not giving a fuck is what kept em' in ties
Could you believe it (believe it)
It wasn't easy (wasn't easy)
I didn't know if they'd be down to stay or leave me
Do I save (do I save) or get some Jeezys (get some Jeezys)
'Cus I never know if one day I'll need it (I'll need it)
Do I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I'mma always push the hustle 'till I run out of breath (run out of breath)
The bitches have been down for years and still ain't left (still ain't left)
? are for sale so you could match my fresh, look

[Chorus:]
I ain't never goin' broke (goin' broke)
I ain't never goin' broke (goin' broke)
I ain't never goin' broke (goin' broke)
I ain't never goin' broke (goin' broke)
I ain't never goin' broke (goin' broke)
I ain't never goin' broke (goin' broke)

[Verse 2:]
Master plannin'
I be plottin', I be schemin', tryna' keep my bands up
If it look worth I might take the gamble
She be tryna' see me when it make me champion
Yeah, rings for a king
A rollie, a 911, just a hood nigga dream (dream)
? lookin' good you would agree (agree)
Walk up in the club, you look if you with me
I put the Visa up (up), told 'em to beat it up (up)
After this bitch you drink it all nigga we ringin' out (ringin' out)
B.M.F., I'm blowin' money 'cus we see enough ('cus we see enough)
Cop some property and after that we clean it up (clean it up)
Flippin' houses, some hundred thousands
Couple ? got a nigga do some wildin'
And smoke dope before they do it, it get foul quick
I need it all, I'll never be without it, for real (real)

[Chorus]
