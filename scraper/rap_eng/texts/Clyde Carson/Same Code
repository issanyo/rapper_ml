[Verse]
(Yeah)
Birthday cake
Make a wish and snap the fingers
Act the world like Clyde
Young cash has got dancers
All up in my space
If your glasses ain't full
You should bring some more ice
Niggas spot around the city
Like weâ€™ve run this town
[?] the corners all the [?]
That flaggin' me down
I ain't [?] when I tell you that I deserve the crown
Yeah I deserve it now
Never disturb the sound
[?] from last night
And told 'em all up again
Hell a lot [?] with a car full of haze
You know me: it's 'bout some dough
I be the first one coming'
When we walk up in the spot she be the first one to me

[Chorus]
Bad light, stripper, pole
All through the house putting on a show
Five teens in my low
Necklace [?] full of gold
Get it now
She sayin' [?]
[?] Lil' Jon tell her: "Get Low"
Same nigga, same code
More dope
Get money
Never get old

[Bridge]
Yeah
That's what I need
That's what I need
What else would I need?
What else would I need?
What else would I need?
What else would I need?

[Outro]
Grab a bag and brag about it
Fuck a model and never call her
Alcohol and some Hyphy Juice
Bad bitches and Marihuana

Grab a bag and brag about it
Fuck a model and never call her
Alcohol and some Hyphy Juice
Bad bitches and Marihuana
