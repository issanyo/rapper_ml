Yeah I put the top down on my brand new B
Top notch on my job
I’m just a young fly nigga out here on D
You can hear me coming out my block
Another day another dollar, hit me we can holla
For some paper I’ll be on time
Harder ladies swear to God they in love with me
But nigga I don’t pay that shit no mind
I just go maniac or stu stu don’t believe in cuban
Got a fetish for new diamonds, no cubic say, time we hit the stay
Yeah they lose it all my bumpers so I bump it and I
Then I lose I taught a class with the game in the the husslers handbook
Still been a long time, come and same cooks
Still rock it with the whole fam same crooks
Dedicated to follow the play book
