[E-40]
She ready!

[Chorus: Clyde Carson]
You ain't with the shit
I ain't got time
Tryna' get you back to the crib
So we can unwind
Ready, ready, think she ready
Ready, ready, think she ready
Ready, ready, think she ready
Ready, ready, think she ready

[E-40]
She ready!

[Verse 1: Clyde Carson]
Impatient
Ready for the word, what I say she down to do
That late shit
Sippin’ on it straight, when she drinks she adds the juice
I'm a richer, more updated version of the nigga that she fuckin' with
I can see it from the front so I already know what I’m up against
Shawty like to entertain
Poppin' bottles in the coupe
Her clothes never [?] mine
Ohhh, yeah, it's good once you get her loose
Get her loose
Get her loose
Know I'm tryna' ride up in that caboose
Gin and juice
Get her loose
You know I'm a dawg let the [?]

[Chorus]

[E-40]
She ready!

[Verse 2: E-40]
I am in this thang twisted
Ripped
Double shots, double fisted
Lit
My lil' homie got the biscuit
[?]
Get to knock it like a visit
Hello
Boy he has the dreadlocks
Mannish
Clips with thirty shots
Damage
Maseratis in the parking lot
Italy
All from the [?]
[?]
She on me cus' I'm heavy
Weight
Robin Jeans and Giuseppe
Great
Ballin' like a motherfucker
Factor
Got it wetter than the splash brothers
[?]
Franck Muller watch on my arm
Investments
Yellow diamonds, looking like corn
VVSs
More jewelry than a treasure chest
I'm in a ballin' session with my hand on her breasts

[Chorus]

[E-40]
She ready!
