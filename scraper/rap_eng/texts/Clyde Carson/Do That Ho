[Intro:]
Hold Up (echo)

[Verse 1:] (Clyde Carson)
I got the strip sowed up, two in line
I put my nigga on cause we both gon’ shine
Used to hit up Dre’s when it’s toast up time
When I come around bitch it’s ho up time
Used to dream of flossing, driving drop tops (drop tops)
Back when the bitches were playing hopscotch
The flyest on my block, all this game she gon’ buy some
The rappers that you listen to, hell nah
He do’n thump, he ain’t hot
They wanna hate on me but she don’t mind
Cause everytime I call her phone, bitch, she on time
Pass the bomb x2
I got the penny, he got the Aston Mar’
She threw her panties, I told her add the bra
Naked on stage, and that’s shit’s brawlin’

[Chorus:]
Fallin’ in love (don’t do that bro x2)
You thinkin’ she da one (don’t do that bro x2)
You wanna wife her (don’t do that bro x2)
Cause she a real go getter (tell her do dat ho x2)
Do that ho [x2]
A real pimp would tell that bitch man
Do that ho [x3]
A real pimp will go hard like
Do that ho [x2]

[Verse 2:] (D-Lo)
I might not sell a million records but I sell put (but I sell put)
All my money go in dope nigga, straight cush (straight cush)
I be ridin thru slapping ma city slappin’ two shows (two shows)
We can put a broke bitch out like a new po’
All ma niggas off lean, nigga no go (no go)
Hands in ma pocket then five on da ten to fo’
Look… I’m in the fly zone (fly zone)
Too many bitches on my line, I got two Iphones
I used to be a rolling stone, now I own shit
Used to ride cycles, now graduated to four wheels
You got 99 pro’lems, I ain’t got one (I ain’t got one)
On my daughter, I ain’t got one (nuh uh)
I’m a rapper nigga, a ratchet nigga
Don’t get it twisted I’ll clap a nigga (rrrahh)
I be rockin’ wit ma AP (AP)
Wit a coco bitch that like to f... me

[Chorus]
