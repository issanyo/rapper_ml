[Verse 1:]
Uhh, ayy
Go getta
Real nigga
You try to win
They try to kill ya
I understand
Left me for dead
Thought I was finished
I re-appeared
Got a plan, if we stick to it
Everybody straight
All that frontin' befo'
That's why everybody paid
Got my whole crew behind me
Yeah, we all chasing cake
All my niggas in foreigns
All my niggas in space
I go Kelly Bundy stupid
Tell ShonuFF to loop it
We never slow down
Rich as George Lucas
For now the top roofless
That's just one of my whips
And if she ain't the one
I just won that bitch, peace
Pockets [?]
Pockets hella obese
Word to B.I.G
I be gettin' cashed out
Like a cashed out [?]
Moe Doe is the label
Clyde Carson, The Team

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Uhh, ayy, go getta
Gorilla
Hella gold
Gold member
Hella trees
Woah, timber
I, I ain't scared
Of no nigga
Get on top of your bitch
Get on top of her face
Give it to me like Janet
Any time, any place
I could pencil you in
Or you could get a wraith
You ain't handin' no cash
Then I'm pumpin' my brakes
Go getta, my dreams bigger
My car's ain't no lease
Table full of Benjamins
I'm havin' a feast
On the case, Sho gave me the beat
Hennessy and weed, word to P.A.C
I've got my feet up on the couch
Standin' in the club, ?
Poppin' bottles
I'm just pourin' up
I've got my feet up on the couch
Standin' in the club
Poppin' lids, poppin' bottles
I'm just pourin' up

[Chorus]
