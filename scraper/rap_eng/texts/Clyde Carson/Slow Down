[Hook]
I tell 'em, slow down
You know you can't catch me
I move too fast on the gas, don't chase me
Slow down, slow down

[Verse 1: Clyde Carson]
(I tell 'em…) Aye, I'm on the case getting sideways
Dolla fo' five on the highway
You know a nigga state to state
On a dolo mission, I got a date with the cake
Wide awoke, 3 A.M
Prolly touch down when the sun come in
Aye, when them guards hit the gate
I be tired as fuck after that 8-hour race
I come from the land where we swing our cars
Figure 8 Benz concrete leave marks
Call it paid, super-charged
Back to back race the Benz with the four door Porsche
I'm tearin' up tires in this luxury
Hella smoke says she wanna fuck with me
Money on my mind, ain't nothin' for free
Tryna keep up with me, but it's nothin' to me

[Hook]
I tell 'em, slow down
You know you can't catch me
I move too fast on the gas, don't chase me
Slow down, slow down

[Verse 2: Kaz Kyzah]
(I tell 'em…) Slow down, you know you can't catch me
Hype without fugitive; Snipes Wesley
Fuzz get on me, tried to test me, arrest me
Wetter than a mothafucka, whip like a jet ski
Ride like Presley, pills like Graceland
They wanna ship me to Rita and off to reception
Nah, ain't tryna see the state pen
I'm Black Scaled out in my Ray-Bans
Diamond-certified, I ain't never lied
I ain't had L's since Pac died
Ridin' through the biters
Couple bundles talking 'bout sliders
Run from the labors, mind's still swift
FedEx movement all on the bitch
Audi with the stash box, Cazzy too swift
No frontin', push a button, give a nigga that gift

[Hook]
I tell 'em, slow down
You know you can't catch me
I move too fast on the gas, don't chase me
Slow down, slow down

[Verse 3: Mayne Mannish]
I'm Jeff Gordon in his heyday
Ridin' like Tony Stewart smashing through a two-way
Doing 'bout a hundred, kinda burnin' up the Louis
Louis, Louis 13th mothafucka, yeah, Louis
D.U.I. drivin' black, Henny on my lap
Pedal to the floor, with a 808 clap
Money motivated, doing sprints when I'm chasin'
And it gotta be a hemi, I don't normally do the basic
Six-cylinder, r-really, bruh? Slow it down, keep up
And I'm killin' ya, hope I'm not offendin' ya
See you at the finish line, leavin' em
Burn rubber, bu-burn rubber
This is how we do it when I'm dippin' on a corner
Burn rubber, bu-burn rubber
This is how we do it in Northern California

[Hook]
I tell 'em, slow down
You know you can't catch me
I move too fast on the gas, don't chase me
Slow down, slow down
