[Hook]
Pour up pour up pour up, pour up some drank with me
Roll up Roll up now, Roll up some dank with me

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
It’s the motherfucking world nigga
Avion everywhere
Champagne extravaganza
If you fuck niggas askin' them questions I got answers
Big booty, red bone look like a dancer
The way a nigga blowing that strong, might have cancer
Drop no top baby chemo
City round  my waist cost a kilo
Same coupe different color, call it CeeLo
Bad Mexicana out west, she call me primo
She know I keep my shooters with me never solo
Said she love the way I kick it like a cholo
Choppers layin' all around the mental like the navy
I don't know about this rap shit this motherfucker crazy
Pop 20 bottles of Rose by the pool nigga
Niggas  at the gate where they ours and  they a fool nigga
Do this shit till the sun set nigga
South Central to Sunset nigga
Mission Impossible, yeah  Tom Cruise shit
100 Thousand metric tons, nigga fill a cruise ship
I'm like fuck it, two Glocks in a bucket
Let my little niggas handle that think nothing of it
I'm wondering what you niggas is claiming, just throw it up
And I don't know what these bitches is drinking just pour it up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Clyde Carson]
Got some broads in my living room
More up on the way don’t get offended boo
Ciroc in the cabana if you hot then get up in the pool
Got her kickin' off her tennis shoes
Young Magnificent with tree on deck
Acting innocent till she take that sip
Dom Perignon and some Pinot gris
Peach Ciroc and probably some pink rozay
Won’t get far on that hatin' shit
Bucket of some ice on some Ace of Spades
Gangsta remix Young Jeez and Game
Young Clyde Carson you don’t know the name
We getting high on the west coast, west coast, west coast
Got the best smoke, dollars like Creflo
Let my [chest?] pour, Hennie in my red cup just a play boy
Bottles up let’s pour

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Game]
They call me Disco Chuck
If I pull the Lamborghini out, a bitch gon' fuck
Gas speed up gas speed up
Disrespect one of my niggas get your ass beat up
Diamond like 10, great J's feet up
Nigga out of ace tell they ass re-up
We up where the clouds and the [lids?] be
G6s playing for the RiRis
I tell a bitch back it up beep beep
She said chuck slow it down, skeet skeet
She want the D
So I politely just come in her weave
She don't want to leave, roll up the tree
She want a nigga to break of the leaves
She want the keys
Nada baby, remind me of Eve, Ruff Ryder baby

[Hook]

[Outro]
