(ShonuFF)

[Verse 1:]
Heh, ay, treat me like a king I deserve to be pampered
Came too far to be livin' like Sanford
Rare breed
Gettin' pussy on campus
Told me when she seen me couldn't wait to turn cash in, carefree
Effortless
I donâ€™t live by glide, Clyde Drexler shit
Really M.J. 'bout mine without the extra years
All acting, planning, gone have extra tears
We back to back on the highway
Really on the hunt tho
Hit about five states
Gone for a month
Blowin' bomb in the SS
Got her hair pressed
Holdin' up her face with her hand: "Are we there yet?"
Sun down
High hopes pullin' into town

[Chorus:]
No sleep
No sleep
No sleep
No sleep

[Verse 2:]
(Ay) I ain't ask for this, you chose up
Before you came around, I been good
You wanna hang around like clothes, huh?
Finna hang yo ass up like Suge
I need another break to froze up
Fucked around and stole a Rolex
I came around with both the doors up
She ain't even know I had that
Slick moves, need some tissue
Shittin' on 'em, sittin' on 'em
Rims cuttin' up the block when they bend the corner
Call the coroner
American muscle and got foreigner
So basically - you all - can't complain when you movin' too slow
Say he treat you so bad like Club Nouveau
Under ya eyes is bags but the dough is up

[Chorus:]
No sleep [x4]
