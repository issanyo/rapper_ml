[Intro: Nu Jerzey Devil]
J...
Jerz know what it is man...
Need i say who the fuck I am?..
Ama said it anyway...
It's the mother fucking Black Wall capone...
Nu Jerzey Devil...
With my Black Wall green squad...
Jea..

[Verse 1: One Shot Deliano]
They say we know Jerzey Devil, Juice, Menace, so, we've never ever seen One Shot Deliano
No myspace page, no fucking facebook, but only Lamborghini Turem got a bitch face hook
Doir frames, stay in something Gucci, when I get tired I stay in some blurry
Now ask if they wanna talk abut how I dress: black wall, TV Kiss, Glock nine no burst
In my two front packets - two ashed eclipses, in my two back packets enough to buy you bitch
Like am grab monery plus T-Boy bricks niggas talk about that, but bitches talk about this
They don't plain like bloodz and don't walk like creeps
Sex, drugs and guns, keep money on my mind
The California weed smoke keep a hustle filling fun
That's why the Sun gon shine, light it back and it blinds...

[Hook]
Lets talk about the money, the drugs, the sex and guns and who got next, nigga?
Lets talk about rappers then trappers then snitches then priesest this makes to the fakes, nigga
Lets talk about Europe, Japan, so gone us to freaks, to the money in the bank, nigga
Lets talk about Africa, London, Sydney, Spain, I was rocking at the stage, nigga
Lets talk abut it...

[Verse 2: Menace]
Niggas talk about paper, the hood where you got it, talk about give up men and forget about the problem (menace)...
I did hustle, hoe, selling blocks at row, late night under street lights trying sell it all
Niggas know they fake, but shit it no aiming for, I'm feeling like shot in Glock is a gunned all
I'd seen the world, and I had shifted all, and I had choked it all, pimpin' case and pissed them all
Now the critics wanna hate me, the streets wanna take me, after meeting I just have a baby
The swag keep my gun on safety daily, cause lately the train leave. Fuck you! Hate me!
Fuck I need a cap for, niggas can fade me, I'm, so, in San Tropez, chilling with the Shady, so nigga it is blame in (menace) corner race in a hood to the mean crack fuck me

[Hook]
Lets talk about the money, the drugs, the sex and guns and who got next, nigga?

Lets talk about Europe, Japan, so gone us to freaks, to the money in the bank, nigga
Lets talk about Africa, London, Sydney, Spain, I was rocking at the stage, nigga
Lets talk abut it...

[Verse 3: Clyde Carson]
After temple we was out, London was a lie about your Henisberg was Porsche spilt the energy and hanging over
Every night, every fly, every day I loose stage hood nigga living running trains after any state
How will i survive, crowds? Bitches screaming "top" and they lost
Ten a shit pimp turn rapper ride in a front of the world
Used to hook by alter "wacko" only off of the court
Still ballin', pussy still all in
Unpopular hoes in Slovakia have a tree smokes where is normally I operate
Was a three cake from the fourth men in audience is rocking what if case split energy but she now that we sicking
Kick blades, zips burn, turn me on a mic, let 'em hear some bay music speaks changes for the trip
Here we all connected after coachin' me and Slim, One Shot Deliano got another round to see, clyde..
