[Verse 1: Clyde Carson]
We blowin’ money in the fast lane
Getting checks putting doobies in the ashtray
Let my pants sag, [?], extra clean
Mouth on her, give me everything I need
A playboy and the world is my playground
First class but I got it from the grey hound
Eyes wide, lookin’ for the take down
That’s ‘cause we ride high, sippin’ on that H Town
Hit [?] for another pack
Another show, bringin’ in some other stacks
Hardly ever recline
Paper chasin’ ain’t no room for me to relax
Hoppin’ up out the car, run in the sto’
Original sweet, some Grey Goose on the go
Everyday shit, I just wanna get mo’
Ball till we fall, talkin’ money to blow

[Hook: Clyde Carson] (x2)
Smoke a little weed this is everyday, everyday
Pour a little hen’ this is everyday, everyday

[Verse 2: Kaz Kyzah]
I’m up early every morning (Every morning), like every day
And I’ve been seein’ that money comin’ like every way
But now I [?]
[?] on the Chevrolet, make that bitch levitate
One life, so we live it to the fullest mane
Up and down the coast like a fuckin’ bullet train
Yeah, I play the cut like a close shave
Till I’m on a bitch head like a ball fade
Get paid the motto and the motto never optional
Get money or die, shit the only thing you gotta do
Over any obstacle, niggas, they got a problem? Cool
T minus [?] special, I’ll send the racks through
Never lose, every day we for the win
Small minded niggas better get a wider lense, shit
We in the lights but the lights never dim
So when they ask where I’ve been, I’mma say, “Our land”, everyday

[Hook: Clyde Carson] (x2)
Smoke a little weed this is everyday, everyday
Pour a little hen’ this is everyday, everyday

[Verse 3: Clyde Carson]
New rocks sittin’ all up in my ear and shit
Wood grain every time a nigga stearin’ shit
From the bottom, but a nigga came up, fuck with me
Only niggas hang around is the ones who’s stuck with me
Hard on myself, ‘cause you never get a second chance
Still gettin’ cashed out ‘fore I get up in her pants
I’mma a playa, Too Short shit
If she want me she can choose, ‘cause we don’t force shit
Last out all over this thing, money all over the place
Why would I ever sit down? How could you not relate?
Make it up out the town, how could you not be great?
Anything possible, now the whip is optional
Me and big bruh on E-14
Outta town to the lot, he just got one mo’
Celebrate the life every night, it’s my show
Niggas do what we want ‘cause we just that dope

[Hook: Clyde Carson] (x2)
Smoke a little weed this is everyday, everyday
Pour a little hen’ this is everyday, everyday
