"Black car, black rims, black coat
Black shades, black jeans
Black shirt, black ice, black hoes
Black light, stripper pole

Real dope in my swisher, henny in my red cup
Bitches on my bumper, got these haters fed up
Real nigga, real nigga, real nigga, real nigga

I got hundreds in my swisher, henny in my red cup
Bitches on my bumper, got these haters fed up
Real nigga, real nigga, real nigga, real nigga

(Aye)
Black car, black rims, black coat
Black shades, black jeans
Black shirt, black ice, black hoes
Black light, stripper pole
Poppin' pussy all night

Four door, seven Tre on 8's
Ridin' dolo, did it big
Have faith on the promo
Yeah, they wanna see my face
So I gold on, eyes low behind my Rays
Nigga bands __ hands, I'm the man
I can't afford to clown ____
Stay in the loop, stay in demand.. "
