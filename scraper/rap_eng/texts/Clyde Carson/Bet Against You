[Verse 1]
New business, ain't finished
Mothafuckin' life
They just scared, my cousins sinners
Free med, still trippin'
Clippin' of the ?, but is exact with my sissors
I'm livin, I'm fillin'
Like gur, that nigga
Saucin' in my Gucci slippers
Gorgeous feet just for my women
Percy Miller, see no limits
Earl Stevens saucin' with it
Young Clyde feelin' killer
Young Clyde feelin' killer

[Chorus]
You
(Why she on my ?, why, why she on my)
(Why she on my ?, why, why she on my)
Tryin' to bet against you
Bet against you
(I'm doin')
You
(Why she on my ?, why, why she on my)
(Why she on my ?, why, why she on my)
Tryin' to bet against you
Bet against you

[Verse 2]
I'm drippin', they slippin'
Tryin' to keep up, but they just ain't got the vision
Follow soon, get busy
I'm pushin' my line, while my neck and wrist is freezin'
On water, dog walker
If it's problems, if it's problems, if it's problems
In the studio, we get straight to them karmas
Like 2Pac, I got amibitionz of a ridah
I got rocks up in my ring, like I got titles
Can be star like Michael Jordan in the finals
Michael Jordans on my feet, where did you find 'em?
With this shit don't need no mothafuckin' wind-up

[Chorus]
You
(Why she on my ?, why, why she on my)
(Why she on my ?, why, why she on my)
Tryin' to bet against you
Bet against you
(I'm doin')
You
(Why she on my ?, why, why she on my)
(Why she on my ?, why, why she on my)
Tryin' to bet against you
Bet against you
