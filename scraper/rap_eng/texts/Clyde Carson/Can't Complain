[Chorus: Clyde Carson]
Another night, I gettin' money, how can I complain?
(I complain, I complain)
Your girlfirend lookin' like she can't be contain
(be contain, be contain)
She think I'm friendly (think I'm friendly)
She think I'm handsome (think I'm handsome)
It's no wonder why you think that I'm the man (I'm the man)
I look good and you look bad
It's no wonder why you think that I'm the man (I'm the man)

[Verse 1: Clyde Carson]
Another night of getting money, how could I complain?
(How could I complain? How could I complain?)
You ain't talkin' 'bout money, I cannot relate
(I cannot relate, no, I can't relate)
Little weight on my shoulders is gettin' heavy now
Gettin' heavy now (is gettin' heavy)
But that come with it, no I ain't gonna let you down
(No let you down)
I'mma deal with it, then go get some ills with it
I'mma chill nigga, but I got the kill spirit
Ticket, last night but she still feel it
Ace of Spades, if she wanna take a pill with it - right girl?
Drank up, tryin'a tell me something
Only problem is that you can't tell me nothing
Boss up when a nigga saw us, fuck 'em
Now I'm ballin' and I do what I want

[Chorus: Clyde Carson]
Another night, I gettin' money, how can I complain?
(I complain, I complain)
Your girlfirend lookin' like she can't be contain
(be contain, be contain)
She think I'm friendly (think I'm friendly)
She think I'm handsome (think I'm handsome)
It's no wonder why you think that I'm the man (I'm the man)
I look good and you look bad
It's no wonder why you think that I'm the man (I'm the man)

[Verse 2: Iamsu!]
I like, when you do that, baby
Come ride, in the new Mercedes
Run to the money to my legs get sore
Roll that skunk 'till my eyes get low
Taking shots to the dome, she hot like a stove
I walk up in the mall, buy everything up out the store
Bag full of stories, [?] life get it go
Every single song I get on that shit go
Everybody put me on, straight [?] dash, cop a milli for the hoes
'Cause I still bust moves on the under
And I still put bitches in a Honda
I'mma mack, like my mom,  they wonder
Countin' hundred dollar bills, motherfucker
