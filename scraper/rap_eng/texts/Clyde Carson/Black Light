It look badder in the black light
Can I hit it in the black light?
Get it, get it in the black light
Is that right?

Excuse me while I get this guy smooched
? with the booze, tan line sipping troop
Right hand on the bible I'm liable to roof
And my dawg then poofed, voila! that moose
I be on that hog, champagne, and orange juice
But when it got dark is when my orange grew
In that black light
It's like the ass get fatter, and the face look badder
Hey hey batter batter
Then the sex swings bat and she know it's gone
My boxers and my socks blowing little pablo
A couple shots taking back to vinyl, spinning then she got naked
Incense burning, the job writing the rules, I'm violating the coup, but not bacon
Boy I'm fresh out the oven, one of the best go discuss it
I don't stress off that rubber, she don't invest in my budget
And on the left they gon' love it, R Geezy, you beezy, it's easy

It look badder in the black light

I got bitches like Eddie Murphy in Boomerang
I'm addicted I got drugs in my limousine
If she hot I'ma' come and put her fire out
Make a mama one to come out of retirement
Dark purple you can smell it through the zig zag
Dark room, black light, where she strip at
Hella faded seeing double
Still got another bundle
It's a ? party at the moto' shop
Mixed Bacardi in my soda pop
I came in tardy on a solo hype
I came in tardy 'cus the show don't stop
I got shit to do, I'm so into you
So full of shit, don't believe it boar
Let's keep it lit, let's speak the truth
I'm tryna' do something in this little private room
