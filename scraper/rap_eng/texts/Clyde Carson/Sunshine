Good morning mama (how are you?)
I ain't called to bother, I ain't got no problems
I just called to holla (I just called to holla)
Traveling the states on tour promoting product (everywhere)
Keep your face everywhere just had to dial up (I tried to call you)
I tell you 'bout the places I've seen
You would've loved Amsterdam ma, it's legal weed (can you believe that)
I could see it clear as day smoking wood-genear
For those who listen, let me tell you why our love is so deep (break
It down)
I was born on the 2nd of June to Ruth Ann
The final pregnancy, out of 7 that bad (miscarriages)
Really it was 6, I was 7th I was the last (I was the last)
Pushed me out took me to 73rd Ave
That's where I got it bad, I'm in love with a good woman
A good person, the closest thing to perfect (Mama)
But I ain't called for nothing this call ain't got a purpose
Cause every moment we spend
I gotta tell you that it's worth it
LOVE YA

[Goapele]
I can't take back the times
There was once I wasn't there for you
I've been dreamin' of sunshine
Summer days I spend 'em with you
I never could go back
So take me for all I am
And all that we've been through

[Kaz Kyzah]
What up Kzaheer, (what up boy boy)
Come here for a second
Put down your toy truck lend your head for a second (listen)
They stressing, lot of late night shows and late night sessions
I was looking at you, my face reflecting
And though you have questions and in need of some answers
'02 pops passed, victim of cancer (that's your grandpa)
I knew he would've spoiled you
He grew up a bastard (jeez)
Learned how to balance life with cries and laughter (real talk)
A year before I had you we reconciled
I was Susanville lock you traveled 800 miles (mmhmm)
For a 4 hour visit, damn it's wild (it's wild)
Cause now I see how deep the love between a father and child
What compares to a star, born from the moon
Yeah we getting dough now, even touring in June
But I'm more juiced when you learn to eat with a spoon (that's big)
Yeah all I do is for you, you'll be seeing her soon

[Goapele]
I can't take back the times
There was once I wasn't there for you
I've been dreamin' of sunshine
Summer days I spend 'em with you
I never could go back
So take me for all I am
And all that we've been through

[Mayne Mannish]
Hello Pops (Wussup Pops?)
I know it's been a few
2 years, couple months since I've spoken to you (been a while)
No tension upon us, we grown up men
I understand it wasn't planned for you bringing me in (I was no mistake)
In and out of my life, I think you left at five
Took till I was 13 to open my eyes (had to grow up)
Realized I had to get grown quick
Move on quick and help mom's so she can pay rent (had to help mom's too)
And I admit you came through
4th quarter crunch time (came through though)
Supporting times when I couldn't afford a dime (uh huh)
You see me on my grind (yea)
Yeah I chose to rhyme
I'm good at it, I stood at it, it took time (took time)
Yes your son is blessed
You're the sun not the rest
I'm gon make you proud of me when I reach success (I'mma make it pops
Fa'real)
I overcame the past, Pops let it be the past (let it be the past)
It only matters that I'm your son and you my dad
