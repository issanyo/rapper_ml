[Hook]
She want that old thing back
I just needed time to get away for a sec
I be thinking about you everyday when I'm stressed
You the only one that hold me down like that
She want that old thing back
I just needed time to get away for a sec
I be thinking about you everyday when I'm stressed
You the only one that hold me down like that
Old thing back
She want that old thing back
Old thing back
She want that old thing back

She want that old thing back
I just needed time to get away for a sec
I be thinking about you everyday when I'm stressed
You the only one that hold me down like that

[Bridge]
These other bitches out here ain't got nothing on you
I don't even know why I be fronting on you
Hate to see another nigga loving on you
That's why I'm trying to figure out what's the next move

[Verse 1]
Yeah can we make up
Can we try this shit again
I ain't ready to give up
I done reached out, I've been calling
But that still ain't enough
You gon' make me do some hood shit
(?)
And you got me working hard just to get your attention
Whatever I could do just to let you know I'm serious
I'm just trying to see how you're doing
Hey I'm curious
Playing hard to get but I'm knowing that you're feeling it

[Hook]
She want that old thing back
I just needed time to get away for a sec
I be thinking about you everyday when I'm stressed
You the only one that hold me down like that
She want that old thing back
I just needed time to get away for a sec
I be thinking about you everyday when I'm stressed
You the only one that hold me down like that
Old thing back
She want that old thing back
Old thing back
She want that old thing back

[Verse 2]
She want that old thing back
Before the arguments and all the misunderstandings
(?)
I know you miss all the playing
Trips around the world
I know you miss all the planes
Where did we go wrong
Fuck it, I'll take the blame
They say the hardest thing in the world to do is change
Brought another life into this world on mistake
Ooh we was doing something wrong but would never trade
That situation turned me into the man I am
Got me thinking about putting jewelry on that hand
Take responsibility, you know that I'm gon' stand
We forever linked together
Yah your fam my fam
So if you need something
I'll make sure you need nothing
I'm on my feelings with you
That's 'cause you mean something
Ain't the nigga out here that's gonna be fronting
And I know you feel the same about me, don't ya?

[Hook]
She want that old thing back
I just needed time to get away for a sec
I be thinking about you everyday when I'm stressed
You the only one that hold me down like that
She want that old thing back
I just needed time to get away for a sec
I be thinking about you everyday when I'm stressed
You the only one that hold me down like that
Old thing back
She want that old thing back
Old thing back
She want that old thing back
