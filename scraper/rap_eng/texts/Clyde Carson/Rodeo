(Chorus)
Hop up on the saddle, hot in here, girl, that's cool
Everybody watchin', don't stop doin' what you do
Take em to the rodeo (can't let em show)
Take em to the rodeo (and let a lil go)

(Verse)
Ah, girl don't stop movin'
Ah, girl, put yo back into it
Back it up, show em how you do it
Got em all watchin', let em youtube it
Ya got em like ge-ge-get it
Where ya from? Rep yo city
She said you wanna hop on this
If ya got a tight grip I'm wid it

(Pre-Chorus)
I'm whippi yayeah whippi yayo
Whippi yayeah whippi yayo
Come and rock this rodeo

(Chorus)
Hop up on the saddle, hot in here, girl, that's cool
Everybody watchin', don't stop doin' what you do
Take em to the rodeo (can't let em show)
Take em to the rodeo (and let a lil go)

(Verse 2: Clyde Carson)
Ah, ey, would you ride for me, baby?
Ride on me, baby? When I need a girl, will you be in sight?
No surprising my lady when times get shady
Need someone who'll be down for the fight on top
Got the bow for the dugger, barbecue on the water
Kings means kings, don't get too tired
Hop up on it, take another rock
You're lookin' hella fine, still feelin' hella hot

(Pre-Chorus)
I'm whippi yayeah whippi yayo
Whippi yayeah whippi yayo
Come and rock this rodeo

(Chorus)
Hop up on the saddle, hot in here, girl, that's cool
Everybody watchin', don't stop doin' what you do
Take em to the rodeo (can't let em show)
Take em to the rodeo (and let a lil go)

(Bridge)
Don't stop ridin' it in slow motion
Don't stop, yo ass is causin' commotion
Don't stop ridin' it in slow motion
Don't stop, don't stop

(Chorus)
Hop up on the saddle, hot in here, girl, that's cool
Everybody watchin', don't stop doin' what you do
Take em to the rodeo (can't let em show)
Take em to the rodeo (and let a lil go)
