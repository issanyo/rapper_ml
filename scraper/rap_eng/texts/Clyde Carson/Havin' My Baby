[Intro: Jonn Hart]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Okay

[Chorus: Jonn Hart]
We in this bitch, we turn it up
Swagger on a hundred, purple in my cup
I tell my young thugs don’t shoot up the club
Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be havin' my baby, baby (ohh)
That should be havin' my baby, baby (ohh)
That should be havin' my baby, baby (ohh)
That should be havin' my baby, baby, baby
Oh whoa!

[Verse 1: Jonn Hart]
Dope boy fresh, I can make her cookin' up
We’re in this bitch deep, so I gives a fuck
Keep them buzzes comin', you know that I’m turnin' up
See about 20 bad broads that I wanna cut
I-I-I feel it, she could, she could get that
Sexy little vixen, mama, let me hit it
Switch up you life to life by just rollin' with me
You’ll be a millionaire, if-if you have my baby

[Chorus: Jonn Hart]
We in this bitch, we turn it up
Swagger on a hundred, purple in my cup
I tell my young thugs don’t shoot up the club
Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be havin' my baby, baby (ohh)
That should be havin' my baby, baby (ohh)
That should be havin' my baby, baby (ohh)
That should be havin' my baby, baby, baby
Oh whoa!

[Post-Chorus: Jonn Hart]
Have my baby, have my, have my baby, girl
Have my baby, have my, have my baby, girl
Have my baby, have my, have my baby, girl
I see some ladies tonight that should be havin' my baby

[Verse 2: Clyde Carson]
No kids but with the practice, bad enough to be a actress
You just wanna get me mad love, won’t be mad on my mattress
Hennessey, apple, juice and Goose, I got a full bar
More dough, house party, team is here, you better watch your broad
Got a new car for every new day, top is off, no toupe
Flow is stupid, Bobby Boucher; come tomorrow, I’m in a new state
So tonight let’s make one, me and Jonn 'bout to race home
Bunch of bitches all chasing, gettin' hot, talkin' Cajun
Clyde

[Chorus: Jonn Hart]
We in this bitch, we turn it up
Swagger on a hundred, purple in my cup
I tell my young thugs don’t shoot up the club
Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be havin' my baby, baby (ohh)
That should be havin' my baby, baby (ohh)
That should be havin' my baby, baby (ohh)
That should be havin' my baby, baby, baby
Oh whoa!

[Post-Chorus: Jonn Hart]
Have my baby, have my, have my baby, girl
Have my baby, have my, have my baby, girl
Have my baby, have my, have my baby, girl
I see some ladies tonight that should be havin' my baby

[Bridge: Jonn Hart]
Little momma, you know you can get it
Let me take you home, girl, you know I'ma hit it right
You know I'ma hit it right
Oh oh!
So tell my young thugs, they ain’t gotta shoot
There's way too many women, here for me and you
Let’s just pop some bottles, and we’re gonna keep it cool
So I'm tryna take some ladies back to my room

[Chorus: Jonn Hart]
We in this bitch, we turn it up
Swagger on a hundred, purple in my cup
I tell my young thugs don’t shoot up the club
Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be havin' my baby, baby (ohh)
That should be havin' my baby, baby (ohh)
That should be havin' my baby, baby (ohh)
That should be havin' my baby, baby, baby
Oh whoa!

[Post-Chorus: Jonn Hart]
Have my baby, have my, have my baby, girl
Have my baby, have my, have my baby, girl
Have my baby, have my, have my baby, girl
I see some ladies tonight that should be havin' my baby
