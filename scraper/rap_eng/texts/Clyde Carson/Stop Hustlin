[Chorus:]
I’m tryna stop hustlin'
But this shit keep callin'
I’m tryna stop hustlin'
But I ain't tryna stop ballin' nigga
I ain't tryna stop ballin' nigga
No I can’t stop ballin'
I ain't tryna stop ballin' nigga
No I can’t stop ballin'

[Verse 1:]
Addicted to the lifestyle
Every day something new stayin' right down
All my niggas we don’t never ask the price now
In that box shed niggas sittin' high now
Prollin' with the young hoes
All-white beamer like the Pope
I’m tryna give the youth hope now
But all my patnas sell dope
I tried to go straight but got pulled back
Chose on a nigga, came with her bags
Not homophobic when I say I don't fuck with fags
I’m talking punk bitch, straight broke ass
Like ?funk? flash, bitch down
When that money up I’m in town
I’m her dude but to me she just a pimp hoe
Everyday a nigga in style

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Pool table in the den
Ridin' with half the stable in the Benz
My brother from another say he wanna see me win
Yeah, that’s why he slid it to me quick
As soon as he heard she was speakin' on me
Middle finger, you was sleepin' on me
Hella cash, how they greet the homie
Wanna quit but I need it homie
Had to push a hard line in these hard times
For that new 911 that’s all mine
I show up to the table with all shines
Champagne wishes bitches all the time
Putting Guccis on the concrete
I’m in the middle of the trial
I was a broke nigga now I’m paid
And I ain't tryna go back

[Chorus]
