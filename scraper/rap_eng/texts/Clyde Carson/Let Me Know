I let ‘em scream and shout
The best part is when they count you out
While I’m living magnificent from house to house
Couple cats were out of state to hide the cloud
I mean, I’m counting benz on the belly
Vice your soul sister gram from my neighbor door
Sweet but you know how fast that change
7 benz ’cause she had the best hair game
Love it or leave it, the game is for sale
One day your life is in heaven next day could be hell
I see you going down but we never fail
That’s ’cause we stay on the prowl to pick up pick up some tail
Put the lamb down stairs buy a place outside
And every single night we celebrate our mind
Hundred in the slipper hope she come on time
Better fill it up again soon as she hit the garage

Where the money at, where my hoes?
Where the hussles at, where my bros?
Who got the slack dog let me know
I ain’t a yes man, let me know
Let me know, let me know
Where my paper at, let me know
Let me know, let me know
Where my paper at, let me know
I met ‘em scream and shout
The best part is when they cash you out
A couple houses in a couple different states
I supplying with the date, they supplying with the weight
They ain’t touch down but you know ain’t good
I’m out here where’s good that is going good
They say they like the way the blonde girl get it like
Walk in and do a spin for 11 5
Love her to leave it, if you want it achieve it
If you only believe it I could get you with Stephen
Don’t be caught in the moment I wouldn’t condone it
Never give up your name that imported the game
With the caddy in the living room no library
Famous grouper on the pole and give it clyde like hi
See it up strippers up they can climb like pimp
G5 in the sky like high

Where the money at, where my hoes?
Where the hussles at, where my bros?
Who got the stack dog let me know
I ain’t a yes man, let me know
Let me know, let me know
Where my paper at, let me know
Let me know, let me know
Where my paper at, let me know
