Yea...Check it out

[Clyde Carson]
I ain't tryna say I'm rude or nothing
I know you probably ain't' up in the mood for nothing
The same ol' lame talk
Big Daddy Kane walk
Here's my business card look I got game talk

Them niggas is lame
I see what you stuck on
The way that I walk by
The dirt that I brush off
The curves that I touch on is just to remind you
How I feel the lust when I'm standing behind you
When I can't find you, you leave your stance
It's only so long before you're back in relapse
Addicted, it ain't hard to see that
Hard to peep that, it's hardly a secret
I got you, but I ain't releasing
I ain't deceiving, it's all for a reason
Hooked on, this crook strong
Take one look gone
Got her from detox, lil ma can't look wrong

Addiction
You fiendin', you trippin'
You need 'em, you miss 'em
I'm seeing the symptoms
Addiction
You tryin' to focus, tryin' is hopeless
You got it bad, you on it
Addiction
How bad you want it?
The nights the coldest, days the longest
Addiction
It's like a magnet, you gotta have it
Now you's a addict

Hooked from first glance like he so fly
Didn't see why he the ultimate high
Window supplier, posts was on wires
Words from the wires told you to cut ties
It's amazing how to fix a fixer
Through trips and withdrawals you good with one call
You put into layman's you had a lame man
That's when he came in, he wasn't the same man
So focused you dipped to the Cayman's
Saw through the same lens, had real conversations
He roll out, you zone out
Bored in the Days Inn
The more you see him, the more you crave him
He gone too long it's like your whole world caves in
Impatiently waiting for the dose in your veins in
You love you hate him vicious cycle
A addict who gotta have it, it's hard to fight through..

"Saved Message"
"Hey it's me, and I guess your phone is off
But, it's all good I'll leave a message
I just wanted to let you know that I miss you
And I'll wait for you no matter how long it takes
I mean I'll be here when you get home
Give me a call when you get this message, ok
I love you, bye."

[Kaz Kyzah]
My bang, my stroke, pure as dope
It's hard to cope, it's all I wrote
It took over your life, everything sacrificed
Friends gave you advice
But nah, you don't hear it
You're so dependent, love without no limit
Any dough she'll spend it, any roll she'll bend it
So addictive, just to get near you
Why, just to feel you, so high like sesimillia
Memorabilia, drug paraphernalia
Use to zone on, you get my picture
Never hold hands, kiss or slow dance
Turf love, ghetto romance
And when it's through you need a program
Believe no chance, I got you like damn
