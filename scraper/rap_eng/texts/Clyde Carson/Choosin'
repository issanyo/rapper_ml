I sent you a message online, (online)
I sent you a message online, (online)
But you never responded (you never responded)
Now when the radio's on (on, on)
You hearing my song spit (you hearing my song)
Before I couldn't even get a call (a call)
Waiting for the longest (waiting for the longest)
Now you on my line so hard (so hard)
And I know why you falling (I know why you fallin)

[Hook]
You a choosin, choosin, choosin lover
That don't mean a thang
Last week you was fronting, wasn't ready
Now it's not the same
Now why you wanna go so hard
Now don't you know it's way too late
Cause you had your chance to love
And you had your chance to thangs
I see you trying in so hard, to get me
But it is way too late
Cause I'm choosin, choosin
I show up to the club, guess who I see
Soon as I hit the door, who's at my feet
Standing right in front of the vip
Eye contact like I don't see
I don't wanna be bothered, you wonder why I'm a dog
Eaching for the bottles tryina feel like a model
In more than one way baby you thirsty
Right now feeling like you don't deserve it

Brand new atitude, now you seen me buzzing
Wwitch that atitude, cause you see me come up
Brand new atitude, now you seen me buzzing
