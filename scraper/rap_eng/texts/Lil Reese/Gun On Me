[Intro: Beece Daytona]

[Hook: Beece Daytona]
Try to run up on me
Pussy Pussy Bitch, try to run up on me
I dare motherfucker try to run up on me
It's going to be some spilled blood and it ain't going to be my blood
Motherfucker, I got my gun on me, I got my gun on me, I got my gun on me
You better run homie, I got my gun on me, I got my gun on me
Try-Try-Try to run up on me I keep a gun on me

[Verse 1: Beece Daytona]
I got my gun on me; I dare nigga run
Run that motherfucker if you think you want some
Got a chopper and my chopper came with a drum
Get to sounding like a church band when it bum
I up it quick and start shooting just to see them run
There will be nothing left but shells when the cops come
But I'm stained dumb, from the brain son
I feel like I'm Superman when I get behind the gun
I let my nuts hang; I let my clip hang
It's stain gang bitch; we let it gang bang
Throwing up gang signs, my gun I bang mine
When there's drama we are yelling out it's game time
You can't be serious what you repping is delirious, what you try to get I get it, what you want to do I did it
Yeah, Its Beece motherfucker let your gun spray
My chopper is prodigy; I use it when it's gun play

[Hook: Beece Daytona]
Try to run up on me
Pussy Pussy Bitch, try to run up on me
I dare motherfucker try to run up on me
It's going to be some spilled blood and it ain't going to be my blood
Motherfucker, I got my gun on me, I got my gun on me, I got my gun on me
You better run homie, I got my gun on me, I got my gun on me
Try-Try-Try to run up on me I keep a gun on me

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
