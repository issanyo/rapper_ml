[Intro]
Aye miss me with that goofy shit, man
Straight up

[Chorus: Lil Reese]
Gotta be real for yourself
I can't switch, I don't know nothin' else
Yeah, you can catch me by myself
Oh, that's the main reason why I'm by myself
Yeah, that's what's goin' on, nothin' else
Tell you you changed but they changed they self
No I don't need no change, money change itself
But you got to watch 'em, cause fu niggas change they self

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
Yeah, you got to watch 'em cause fu niggas change they self
Sneak dissin', man, that shit bad for your health
Run around with the same niggas, like it ain't nothin' else
To do, hit licks and capers too
Bust a move by myself, I got the tool
Put my back against the wall, I'ma shoot
It don't take much I'ma get through
But the fake I can see right through
Trick me, nah she gon' trick you
Bitch gon' do what a bitch do
Tried to work down but she got loose
Now she don't even know what to do
But a nigga like me, I do
All hundreds in my roll, they blue
Fifty-five, I'ma take care of the crew
Nah, nigga, I ain't nothin' like you
Nah, nigga, I ain't nothin' like you

[Chorus: Lil Reese]
Gotta be real for yourself
I can't switch, I don't know nothin' else
Yeah, you can catch me by myself
Oh, that's the main reason why I'm by myself
Yeah, that's what's goin' on, nothin' else
Tell you you changed but they changed they self
No I don't need no change, money change itself
But you got to watch 'em, cause fu niggas change they self

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
Sneak diss the gang, boy, your ass gon' need some help
Call on niggas, nah I don't need no help
But I'm with my niggas
And everybody got an extended
Niggas act like they with it
But niggas ain't really-really with it
Can't come through the hood or flip it
Can't come to the hood, can't kick it
Can't come through when we ain't tryin' to kick it
Got a check then that you mean got a ticket
And I hate when I got to go visit
See folks locked down, penitentiary
Shit there will fuck a nigga up mentally
But stay strong, young nigga, stay with it
And free the gang locked down in penitentiary

[Chorus: Lil Reese]
Gotta be real for yourself
I can't switch, I don't know nothin' else
Yeah, you can catch me by myself
Oh, that's the main reason why I'm by myself
Yeah, that's what's goin' on, nothin' else
Tell you you changed but they changed they self
No I don't need no change, money change itself
But you got to watch 'em, cause fu niggas change they self
