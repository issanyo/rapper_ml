[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I got bricks all in my wall, man I live with the coke
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
Fuck your plug, come shop with me, got deals on the dope
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I sold a million records but I'm still sellin' dope
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I got a good price on them thangs, that's if you really want some work

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Metro on the beat
Metro PCS, I make a half a mil' a week
Cash smell like cocaina, got Febreeze for all my cheese
And I care less 'bout what you think of me, it's 40K to link with me
15K to drink with me, 10 bands just to smoke with me
Prayin' to the trap god that this boss don't get knocked, hopefully
50 bands, Hammer pants, watch that fine ho dance for me
No this not my fetish bitch, but I got ice all over me
Extendo make my pants sag lower than they 'posed to
And I'm runnin' for another term, nigga come and vote for me
Remote control for your girl, hit a button and she squirt for me
Fucked her out and catch a nut, I quit cause bitch you overworkin' me

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I got bricks all in my wall, man I live with the coke
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
Fuck your plug, come shop with me, got deals on the dope
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I sold a million records but I'm still sellin' dope
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I got a good price on them thangs, that's if you really want some work

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
When a brick was twenty-six, it got me goddamn rich
Taught me how to flip a pack and move them goddamn bricks
Boy if you ain't gettin' no money, go hit a goddamn lick
I rep 12 and 22nd for my niggas slanging bricks
It's ZooWap from the bando, boy this ain't what you want
Rubber grip on my handle, I crush your ass for fun
Not anywhere I can't go, I pull up where I want
Anything is on the counter it's like Fetty tryna stunt
Everyone in my camp go, four others got a gun
Don't you think that we're lackin', the chopper's in the trunk
Hear that shit when it's blastin', I love the way it dump
Used to sleep in the trap house, wake up next to my gun

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I got bricks all in my wall, man I live with the coke
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
Fuck your plug, come shop with me, got deals on the dope
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I sold a million records but I'm still sellin' dope
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I got a good price on them thangs, that's if you really want some work

[Verse 3: Lil Reese]
I got a good price on that lil' thang if you really want some work
All my niggas from the 6, 6-4, they put in work
Man these fuck niggas so lame, man, we gon' stain them first
Take him down for his chain, man, we gon' stain them first
I'ma hit 'em where it hurt, hit 'em where it hurt
Fuck around with me, boy we shoot shit first
Gu-Gu-Gucci and Reese that's a classic verse
Hating on the gang, man, it might get worse
Catch a nigga lackin', it could get worse
Skurrt! The Phantom so fast it get worse
Still sellin' dope, fuck a nigga ho
One night the bitch, 'cuz I can't wife a ho

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I got bricks all in my wall, man I live with the coke
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
Fuck your plug, come shop with me, got deals on the dope
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I sold a million records but I'm still sellin' dope
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I got a good price on them thangs, that's if you really want some work
