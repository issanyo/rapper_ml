[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]
I don't fuck with niggas
They say my tempo fucked up
I tell them niggas fuck'em
Get at me or shut the fuck up
You looking for that street shit
Nigga I'm what the fuck up
Bitch I'm on some M.O.E. shit
Nigga you might get fucked up

[Bridge: Trae Tha Truth]
Niggas saying they looking for me
Tell them niggas I ain't hard to find
Pillow talking, dick sucking, ass niggas
Better close they mouth, and get shit shutdown
Play with them all the fuck you want
I be damn, you come fuck with mine
Bitch I’m king, I don’t give no fuck
Fuck em, yea bitch you’re out my mind

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Some in the back of the shit of what’s next
Two hundred in the trunk, fuck clips
Feeling like anybody get it, so don't flex
Tell them I extend the clip, don’t stretch
Bitch niggas get crash, no bricks
Talk slick, no cares, get chick
No past, fuck last, you next
When I click, pussy nigga they ain't say shit
Say it to my face bitch ass
But a nigga get your whole tree shook bitch
Any nigga want beef, getting cook bitch
I’m a goddamn fool, don't doubt that
4-door, all black, hop out that
ABM, outlaw, 3Hunna
Bump first on a nigga, I’m ‘bout that

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
Young nigga, I'm wassup (3Hunna)
If he think he tough, he get fucked up (bang now)
Ain't playing games we wassup
Keep big 30s when our guns tough
So we fucked up, you get fucked up
These niggas with me don't give no fuck
I’m on some other shit, I might go nuts
Call Broski up with the thirty up
Go nuts with the bitch [?] words that stunt
Ride up on the nigga, all he see is dust
OTF in this bitch, all I see is us
3Huna bitch, all I trust is us
You get your skull bust with that 30 boy
They talking like they bout it, they ain't making noise
I’m from 3Hunna, we make extra noise
Young nigga packing extra toys
They ain't coming where I'm from, I'm a savage boy
Fuck nigga, catch me in traffic boy
I said fuck nigga catch me in traffic boy
