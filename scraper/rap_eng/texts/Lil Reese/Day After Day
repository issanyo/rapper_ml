Day after day
Gotta make a way
Day after day
Gotta make a way

Night after night
I've gotta get right
Day after day
I gotta make a play
If something ain't right
I got to get right
I got to get right
I got to get right

[Hook]
Day after day
That's night after night
Every thing I think about
I got to get it right
Day after day
Play after play
Everyday I do this shit
I've got to get right

Day after day
That's night after night
Day after day
That's night after night
Night, that's night after night
Night, that's night after night

[Verse 1]
Night after night
I've got to get right
Just like Nike I just do it I've got to get right (right)
These nigga's lame (lame)
They steady sneak dissin'
But I don't hear 'em
All these fucking shooters with me
They all shoot through them
Now we can see 'em
No we don't see 'em
Cause they above us
They pillow talking
Man it ain't nothing
Fuck niggas they talking
I know they're bluffing
Well what's the talk about there ain't nothing to talk about
Got a gang of shooters with me that'll chop you out
Boss up or get boss around (haha)
Little fuck nigga you ain't really down


Play after play
Night after night
I got a stain [?]
Let it up right
These niggas fu
I'm doing they right

[Hook]
Day after day
That's night after night
Every thing I think about
I got to get it right
Day after day
Play after play
Everyday I do this shit
I've got to get right

Day after day
That's night after night
Day after day
That's night after night
Night, that's night after night
Night, that's night after night


[Verse 2]
You know how we play
Coolin where it ain't safe
Got choppas in the safe
Don't come in this place
Over here it ain't safe
Don't come this way
Over here they don't play
Got shawty's gonna spray
Grown men gone spray
So you know they don't play
I need that bag, fuck a vacation
(?), and they had to replace you
Bad bitch she replace you
Get money now they hate you
Come up you can come down
Free the guys who don't make a sound
Pull his grammy and he gon' make a sound
Free the guys who been around
For a long long long time
For a long long long time

[Hook]
Day after day
That's night after night
Every thing I think about
I got to get it right
Day after day
Play after play
Everyday I do this shit
I've got to get right

Day after day
That's night after night
Day after day
That's night after night
Night, that's night after night
Night, that's night after night
