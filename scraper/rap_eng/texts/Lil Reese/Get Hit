[Chorus: Lil Reese]
I heard they plottin', I wonder how many, man
See me, I think I could take plenty, man
And I can't leave without my semi, man
Don't fuck around and leave your semi, man
If it ain't 'bout money, what's the fuckin' plan?
Yeah, I know your type, you out here fuckin' playin'
Do a hit on niggas, spin the block, come back again
I don't really give a fuck cause the nigga got hit ain't my mans

[Verse: Lil Reese]
Your bitch goin', she gon' get hit (get hit)
I don't run, knock it out the fence (knock it out the fence)
I ride around with it, I took a risk (we takin' risks)
Still ride around with it, we takin' risks (takin' risks)
I wouldn't even touch that basic bitch (touch that basic bitch)
And I won't leave the house without my stick (without my stick)
I ride around with it, I take a risk (I take a risk)
'Lot of niggas on that Police shit (on that Police shit)
My mouth closed, I don't know shit (I don't know shit)
All I know is I'ma blow shit (I'ma blow shit)
Loud rollin', we be smokin' (smokin')
Kush grown, got me chokin' (chokin')

[Chorus: Lil Reese]
I heard they plottin', I wonder how many, man
See me, I think I could take plenty, man
And I can't leave without my semi, man
Don't fuck around and leave your semi, man
If it ain't 'bout money, what's the fuckin' plan?
Yeah, I know your type, you out here fuckin' playin'
Do a hit on niggas, spin the block, come back again
I don't really give a fuck cause the nigga got hit ain't my mans
