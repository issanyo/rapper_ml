[DJ Drama: Intro]
When you married to the streets
It’s hard to get a divorce
It’s even hard to get a separation
‘Til death do us part!

[Hook: Lil Durk] x2
Money, streets it’s all the same
Power, respect it’s all the same
Life, loyalty it’s all the same
Living in the streets I give you the game

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
System lost my daddy man that shit is scary
Life without parole so much weight to carry
Signed to the streets yea bitch I’m married
Raised raised by the streets man that shit is heavy
Free my nigga Camron free my nigga Reggie
Feds took them down for that anti-reggie
Respect, you need that to be that
You don’t, don’t bleed that don’t bleed that
Serving out the phones that’s an easy case
Feds hands on them got them niggas going crazy
One way out the hood either rich or erased
I’m living in the streets that taught me the game rap game

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
L's up for all my niggas
Money power respect, that’s what I grew up nigga[?]
Living in the streets that’s why we tote them thangs
Some bad bitch on my line tryna give me brain
Got some real niggas in my circle won’t fuck with lames
Life, loyalty, throw L’s that’s how we bang
I ain't switch it up on my niggas how could I change?
But niggas would switch up on they niggas just for that change
Not loyalty you're a fucking nigga can't claim what I claim
Don’t cross us, cause we ain’t doing this shit for the fame
Take a chance, it's whatever, bitches going just to get near that fame
Take a chance, it's whatever, bitches going just to get near that
Let’s get it

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
Teaming up with niggas I was never with it ( Dead )
Time of coming big is turn us into winners
Friends turn to snitches get killed if you mention
Basketball court and straight back to the kitchen
No open jobs right back to the corner
Think the connect 100 but they informers
You can’t beat the set you gotta join
Walking to the store been that rachet noise
Trapping trapping turn to rapping and I made a living
Put D out on my block and I made a killing
Niggas killed my homie and I made them feel it
Signed to the streets, ain’t a fucking difference

[Hook] x2
