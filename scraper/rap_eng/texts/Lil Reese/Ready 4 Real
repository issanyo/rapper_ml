[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
Bro in the back and he loading the steel
He keep repeating “I’m ready fa’real”
I catch the chills, when he shoot the mac
Cause I know that he tryna kill
You niggas playin', ain’t ready to die
Chill, before you get ate like a meal (like a meal)
Pause, before you get shot like a film (like a film)
Ten’ll, have niggas jump on yo lid (jump on his lid)
Don’t go for the injury, go for the kill
Mission failed if niggas live (retry)
Niggas play roles, when I up the steel, they be like “Tee, I got kids”
Two F&N’s, I ain’t talkin' bitches
When I say I’m ridin' with the twins
Scope on the choppa, I ain’t talkin' cameras
When I say I’m ridin' with the lens

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
Off the lean and the drink that’s a pour-up (pour up)
.40 on a nigga when we roll up (roll up)
Can’t control us (nah)
Smokin' on the opp when we roll up (roll up)
Shit got tough I ain’t fold up (fold up)
Stackin' all this money from the floor up (floor up)
Still in the hood and I blew up (blew up)
300 with me and I roll up (roll up)
Me and Tee Grizzley won’t slow up (nah)
Too much money can’t control us (nah)
Too many young niggas rollin' (rollin')
All of these young niggas blowin' (blowin')
All of these hoes be goin' (goin')
All my guns they blowin' (blowin')
I remember I ain’t had none (none)
Young nigga I ain’t had none (none)
Tryna turn none into some (some)
Me know I’ma make some (make some)
Me know I’ma take some (take some)
Me know I’ma shake some (shake some)
Get caught don’t say none (none)
Most of them gon say some
Chill ‘fore lil bro fade some
I caught the chills when he shot the mac
Shit gon happen then it’s that (then it’s that)
Knew I’m gon ride for my set (you know it)
Smokin' on loud that’s a fact (dope)

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
Niggas only thugs on the net (on the what)
Before I got verified, I had a check
A-R pistol make a mess of your flesh
2,000 pills, turn around with them racks (them racks)
I’m strapped, he strapped too (strapped too)
Blow strapped, Reese strapped too (glizzy's)
Manny strapped cause niggas fu (boy)
Don’t let IG get you blew (bitch)
Watch me go in for the kill (for the kill)
Go anywhere cause I’m trill (I'm trill)
Ice hit in the dark cause it’s real (it's ice)
Watch who you shoot they’ll tell (what)
Don’t give a fuck about 12 (naw)
Got niggas locked up in cells (free the real)
So don’t think that you safe in jail
Don’t say free bruh if you ain’t send no mail (bitch)

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
Bro in the back and he loading the steel
He keep repeating “I’m ready fa’real”
I catch the chills, when he shoot the mac
Cause I know that he tryna kill
You niggas playin', ain’t ready to die
Chill, before you get ate like a meal (like a meal)
Pause, before you get shot like a film (like a film)
Ten’ll, have niggas jump on yo lid (jump on his lid)
Don’t go for the injury, go for the kill
Mission failed if niggas live (retry)
Niggas play roles, when I up the steel, they be like “Tee, I got kids”
Two FNN’s, I ain’t talkin' bitches
When I say I’m ridin' with the twins
Scope on the choppa, I ain’t talkin' cameras
When I say I’m ridin' with the lens
