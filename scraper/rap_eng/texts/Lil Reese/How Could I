[Chorus:]
I got a good price, it's for cheap
If you really want some work
Got some niggas from the six
Six four, they put in work all that talking it won't work
Hit him where it will hurt, in the hood where junkies at
Really snorting work, still getting it like the first
First like the first day of school trying to be the first
Man, all that hating it won't work
All that hating it won't work [x3]

[Verse 1:]
Man, all that hating it won't work
Fuck coming last I'm trying to be first
That talking it won't work
Had to get off my ass and got get some cash
Now i'm fresh everyday like the first
Only fuck with niggas that riding me
And going to really put it to work
Just talking it won't work
All that talking it won't work
You gotta show me first
I made that bitch bend over
And told her show me first
I don't talk take about no money
Cause that shit don't work
Finna ball like I came for the dirt
So i'm'a hit you where it hurt
Niggas be plotting try to get the upper hand
I let him hit two were it hurt
Niggas be plotting try to get the upper hand
I let hit two were it hurt

[Bridge:]
I told him to get on the shit first
Told him to get on you niggas first
I told him to get on the shit first
Told him to get on you niggas first
I told him to get on the shit first
Told him to get on you niggas first
I told him to get on the shit first
Told him to get on you niggas first

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
All that hating it won't work, no
Caught a nigga snooze
4-5 jam he better hope his bitch work
Fuck nigga better be lucky he caught a blessing
That shit worked
Lame ass niggas steady running there mouth
You ain't puttin in work [x2]
Youngins on my block
Known for shooting shit they gonna shoot shit first
Coolin where it ain't safe niggas know it ain't safe
So they don't really wanna hang
Coolin with my niggas still with my niggas
A lot of niggas done changed
But know I'm still that gang
And I come back and still hang
Where a lot of niggas they can't
Where a lot of nigga they ain't
Got a good price for the cheap
Just meet me in the back with the bank
We goin get them there hit them there
And take everything as planned
We goin get them there hit them there
And take everything that we can

[Chorus]
I got a good price, it's for cheap
If you really want some work
Got some niggas from the six
Six four, they put in work all that talking it won't work
Hit him where it will hurt, in the hood where junkies at
Really snorting work, still getting it like the first
First like the first day of school trying to be the first
Man, all that hating it won't work
All that hating it won't work [x4]
