My pockets put a couple bands on my wrist
Got my own shit ain't gotta put on for the shits
A lot of bitches choosin cuz they like the team I'm with
These niggas think I'm losin but I'm really off the shits
I be off the shits, I really be off the shits

A lot of niggas losing but they don't be off the shits
A lot of bitches choosin cuz they don't be off the shits

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Niggas fuck with that lean shit, I really be off of that lean shit

Couple of them flex got me pouring up that reject
Got me up high on the moon, tweakin like I'm ET

It's been one cuz we got the streets
Lebron, you could bring the heat
