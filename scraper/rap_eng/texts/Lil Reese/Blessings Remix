[Hook 1]
I ain't lose a lot of my niggas in a long time, so you know I
Ride or die for my niggas, so pussy nigga don't try
We way up I feel blessed
Bitch we right now fuck who's next
I'm way up, I feel blessed, nigga
I'm way up, I feel blessed, nigga
I feel blessed, I feel blessed, nigga
I'm way up, I feel blessed, nigga

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
Hollow tips all in the tec nigga
If I don't hit you, then that means that you blessed nigga
If I don't hit you, then imma hit the next nigga
And the next nigga, yeah you blessed nigga
Fuck around with us and get wet nigga
Young niggas that'll still wet niggas
40 cal, 30 Smith and Wesson nigga
Fuck around with us that's a blessing nigga
We don't fuck with niggas that's a blessing nigga
To fuck with the gang that's a blessing nigga
Mama said don't go outside, still went outside
Came back & whooped my ass, learned a lesson nigga
Had to fuck your bitch, she was desperate nigga
Had to separate myself, yeah separate nigga
All my life I been helping niggas
Said all my life I been helping niggas

[Hook 2]

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
3-4 gun cases a blessing, 40 automatic Glock, Smith and Wesson
Ask the opps bout that show down in Weston
He had a pipe, and bro had to test 'em
OTF 300 niggas reckless
Meek jeweler a blessing, let me put 30 on a necklace
Lost my cousin Nuski I'm stressing
2012, signed my deal for 600k
Shoot 'em up in the broad day, if I hear 300 or 600k
Meek wanted to sign me, TIP wanted to sign me
He knows I'm a savage, got goons right behind me
Killers from the east and the west and a few in New Yor
And Miami, Baltimore, Cali
Atlanta and Oakland where killas be ridin'
Bitch I'm a blessing, fuck all the opps we ain't sneakin' or hidin'

[Hook 3]
Album drop May 12th, they waiting on my gang
Getting bars by myself, and I dare 'em reach for my chain
Do a nigga like Kane
Try to do me like that but I know he can't

[Hook 1 & 2]
