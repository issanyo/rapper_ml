[Hook:Fredo Santana]
I'm smoking on the gas, so stinky like waddam
My neck and my wrist all froze like waddam
Pockets all swollen, they looking like waddam
Pull up to the scene, all the bitches like waddam
Waddam, waddam, waddam, waddam
Pull up on the scene, all the bitches like waddam
Waddam, waddam

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
Pull up on the scene, all the bitches like waddam
You that nigga from the lam, you get down
I heard about your service, don't fuck with clowns
And if a nigga think us, we get blam
Them 300 boys don't fuck around
We be on up that block, we chop you down
Serve them fiends anything now
Anything go for cheap now
It's a drought but it ain't sweet now
Don't try to play us, you get manned down

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Out of town trips, got me feeling like the man
Ten bands in my pants just cause I can
No feeding these bitches money, man, I just give 'em grams
Just robbed my plug for a brick and spent it on a chain
Got niggas talkin' drugs but they ain't sold a thing
I still keep it on me, man, it ain't shit changed
These bitches ain't shit, they just wanna be saved
These bitches ain't shit, they just wanna be saved
In the trap, servin' junkies, steady countin' hundreds
I break the work down then I give it to my cousin
First of the month, man, you know my trap jumping
If you ain't got no work, man, you better sell something

[Hook]
