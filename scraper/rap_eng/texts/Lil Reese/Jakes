[Hook:]
I gotta get this cake cause my name hold weight
Every nigga you see with me got a gun on they waist
Don't fuck with no snitches, niggas they be telling to the jakes
Can't trust them niggas, they be telling to the jakes
A lot of niggas they around but the fuck niggas really be fake
Got a chopper, got a FN, I'mma spray this bitch in your face
Can't fuck with no niggas they be telling to the jakes
Can't trust these niggas they be talking to the jakes
Can't trust these niggas they be talking to the jakes

[Verse 1:]
Bang bang in your face for talking to the jakes[?]
Tryna suck up info to go tell to the jakes
Get the fuck out my face before I hit you with the eight
You ain't been on no block, you ain't shot no eight
You ain't put in no work, you ain't caught no case
We still on the block, you ain't getting no cake
You ain't feeding your niggas, you all ain't ate
You ain't feeding your niggas, they all ain't ate
You ain't feeding your niggas, you all ain't straight
I can look in his face and tell you all he ain't straight
Police snatch him, he gone talk to the jakes
Police snatch me, I ain't talking to the jakes
I'mma make my laywer just fight that case
Ride through 100k cause I like that cake
A lot of niggas they fake so I can't relate

[Hook:]
I gotta get this cake cause my name hold weight
Every nigga you see with me got a gun on they waist
Don't fuck with no snitches, niggas they be telling to the jakes
Can't trust them niggas, they be telling to the jakes
A lot of niggas they around but the fuck niggas really be fake
Got a chopper, got a FN, I'mma spray this bitch in your face
Can't fuck with no niggas they be telling to the jakes
Can't trust these niggas they be talking to the jakes
Can't trust these niggas they be talking to the jakes

[Verse 2:]
As long as I'm getting money, nigga I'mma be straight
As long as I got my niggas, nigga I'mma be straight
I don't need no nigga, nigga I'mma be straight
As long as they print money, nigga I'mma be straight
Gotta hustle by any means, so I can be straight
These niggas get left they won't ride the right way
A lot of niggas be talking but I ain't' saying a thing
All these fuck niggas talking but I ain't saying a thing

[Hook:]
I gotta get this cake cause my name hold weight
Every nigga you see with me got a gun on they waist
Don't fuck with no snitches, niggas they be telling to the jakes
Can't trust them niggas, they be telling to the jakes
A lot of niggas they around but the fuck niggas really be fake
Got a chopper, got a FN, I'mma spray this bitch in your face
