Since a youngin bitch I been that nigga
Rockin designer clothes shoes from my denium

These niggas bitches so I anit with em niggas

Niggas and we all we got play with my brother
Thats like do or die play with the fam thats
So suicide play with the fam thats so suicidel

At your window lay low might shoot inside though
Can't fuck wit niggas most niggas  [they won't ride though] 3hunna ls
