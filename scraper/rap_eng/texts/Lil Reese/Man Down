Let's get this money
Brain Dead
Heard homie got them bands
Hundred rounds, rounds
Choppah spit a hundred rounds

[Hook: Tae Da Blockboi]
Man down, hundred rounds
Only fuck with real niggas, I don't fuck with clowns
Try to run up, then I lay 'em down
Get these bands up, then I take 'em down
Man down, hundred rounds
Only fuck with real niggas, I don't fuck with clowns
Try to run up, then I lay 'em down
Get these bands up, then I take 'em down

[Verse 1: Tae Da Blockboi]
Man down, hundred rounds
AFM, GBE, love that gun sound
Riding with the folks, taking niggas down
Heard he had it on the work, I'mma leave him pounds
We the realest in it, nigga, hands down
Real recognize real, set your fingers down
Lot of pills, lot of weed, lot of bust downs
Lot of niggas, they some hittas, don't fuck around
Mama got me of the dope, moving slow-mo
AFM, GBE, ain't no ho
Mama got me off the dope, moving slow-mo
IYG, Brain Dead, ain't no joke
Pull up with the forty in the lo-lo
Got a thirty clip, I let the thirty blow
Pull up with the forty out the lo-lo
I got a thirty in it, I let it all blow

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
Get these bands up, then I take 'em down
Only fuck with real niggas, I don't fuck with clowns
This thirty that I'm totin', it'll lay him down
Choppah spit a hundred rounds, don't make a sound
OTF, we army strong, taking shit down
Pop a flat, I'm off the shits, I'm rolling now
Lots of bitches, they thirsty, they tryna fuck my crowd
Can't work with fuck niggas, move around
Gots to leave my circle closed, I don't fuck with clowns
Mouthed-up tape, I don't make a sound
OTF, we army strong, taking shit down
Mouthed-up tape, I don't make a sound

[Hook]

[Verse 3: YaYa White]
Nigga run up, then we take him down
IYG, Brain Dead, we run the town
Steady rolling up dope, I'm in the clouds
Only want some mouth, don't pull your pants down
All the folks own choppas, don't stretch around
Spit a hundred rounds, man up, then man down
AFM, hundred D, we move a crowd
GBE, IYG, we don't fuck around
Steady blowing loud, shawty put the mid down
Fuck a cop, we send shots, take down a crowd
Steady blowing loud, shawty put the mid down
Fuck a cop, we send shots, take down a crowd
Light the L, got a nigga moving extra slow
I'm paranoid, I'm quick to let this thirty blow
Foolie rolling up the L, got me extra slow
I'm paranoid, I'm quick to let this thirty blow

[Hook]
