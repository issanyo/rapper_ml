Got my nigga Chase Davis on the beat
Welcome to the EP, feel me?
The Get-Back, Gang, you know?
I'm doin' this shit for my brothers
All my niggas I lost
My momma, my sisters, I'm doin' this shit for everybody
Can't forget nobody
I ain't leavin' nobody behind
But if you left me behind, that's on you
Or thought you left me behind, feel me?
The EP, The Get-Back, Gang
The Get-Back, Gang
The Get-Back, Gang
Get back, get back, get back, get back
Gang, gang, gang
