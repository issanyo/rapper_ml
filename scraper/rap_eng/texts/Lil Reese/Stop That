[Intro]
I tell that bitch go crazy
Gang Gang
Nah for real though, GetBackGang
Real GetBackGang shit
Who into with us?
Who want smoke?
Too much talkin', you ain't really street (nah)
Too much talkin', you ain't really street
You ain't really street (nah) (nope)
You ain't really street

[Verse]
Too much talkin', you ain't really street
Growin' up, ain't a nigga that I wanna be
I don't fuck with niggas, and that's just me
Circle small, you can't get with me
Keep a few thorough niggas with me
Most niggas gon fake it to the tee
Play games, get put up on a t'
I don't want a goofy ridin' with me
Keep your distance, don't ask 'bout me
Bein' real, that shit so simple
It ain't hard, that's what you wanna be
I'm me, I don't give a fuck what you think
So high, I can't even think
4:40 AM, I'm blowin' out the P
Can't touch what you really can't see
If I ain't been with you, nigga you don't know me
Stop tellin' people "yeah" you know me
You an old ass header in the streets
Keep it real, man that's how it's gon be
Need a break, gotta get to the cake
Circle small, man I can't even play
I done seen it in a lot of niggas face
You ain't made for it, boy yo ass gon break
It remind me of First 48
Momma been warned me 'bout the fake
I was just hardheaded everyday
Sat back, thinkin' "we gon be straight"
Just gotta stay away from the fake
In the club, I done snuck in snub
Let a goofy try to act like a thug
Lot of goofies tryna to act like thugs
All that hatin' nigga, ain't no love
Had to fall back from a lot whole of stuff
Catch him by himself, he ain't so tough
Now you on the internet actin' tough
I ain't gotta pay a nigga, they gon ride for none (for free)
They love they get from me, nigga, that's some
Keep it real with my day ones and stuff
A nigga say he don't fuck with me? That's some
But to me it ain't none
I done seen niggas switch up for that cheddar
Every day we together

[Chorus]
Fake love ain't gon get you nowhere (nah)
Stop that (stop that)
Fake love ain't gon get you nowhere (nah)
Stop that (stop that)
All that hatin' ain't gon get you nowhere
Stop that (stop that)
Pussy nigga actin' like they on some (on some)
Stop that (stop that)
Pussy nigga flexin' for these hoes (for these bitches)
Stop that (stop that)
I'm gettin' money nigga, every day (every day)
Stop that (stop that)
Stop that (stop that)
Stop that
Stop that
