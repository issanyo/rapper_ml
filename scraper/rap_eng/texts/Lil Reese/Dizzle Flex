[Intro]

[Hook]
I don't fuck with niggas
You don't see me with 'em, don't ask nigga
I get my shit
I'm cool nigga, I ain't gon' brag nigga
Stay with the shit
Still to get up on your ass nigga
Everyday I wake up
My main focus is cash nigga
Can't be like that nigga
Run around like he that nigga
Knowing damn well he ain't that nigga
If he getting money then flex nigga
Flex, flex, flex, then flex nigga

[Verse]
I won't fucking stop until I get a jet nigga
Looking at my mans like where we at nigga
I popped a X nigga, I'm off a [?] nigga
Floating I might take flight just like that jet nigga
And that bitch thought I was like her next nigga
Well I fucked her and passed her like the next nigga
Getting money all I know is fucking flex nigga
You want war, we want beef, what is that nigga
Can't trust the police cause they ride around, they wack niggas
Got me thinking 24/7, stay strapped nigga
What the fuck is that, I thought they serve and protect niggas
I thought they serve and protect niggas

[Hook]
I don't fuck with niggas
You don't see me with 'em, don't ask nigga

Stay with the shit
Still to get up on your ass nigga
Everyday I wake up
My main focus is cash nigga
Can't be like that nigga
Run around like he that nigga
Knowing damn well he ain't that nigga
If he getting money then flex nigga
Flex, flex, flex, then flex nigga
