[Intro: Lil Durk]
(Gang) Ay, you know how the fuck we do it man
Alotta lotta, (TY Made It)
Alotta lotta

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Durk]
I done did alotta shit
I done fucked alotta bitches
I done been through every hood
I did shot alotta niggas
I done wore alotta watches
And I robbed alotta niggas
And I did every drug
Even shot a choppa nigga

[Chorus: Lil Durk & Lil Reese]
I did alotta lotta
Did alotta lotta (bitch)
Did alotta lotta
Boy I did alotta lotta

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I done did alotta shit, got the opps sick at me
Told me if they see me up in traffic, they gon blick at me
Told my plug he go to Mexico, just throw a brick at me
Buy a Birkin instantly, just to keep my bitch happy
I don’t fuck with pussy niggas, all my killers artificial
I done saved my tour money, I done bought a lot of pistols
Don’t go to my tour money, jeweler set alotta crystals
Boy, we gon use your money, boy, you ain’t my real nigga

[Bridge: Lil Durk]
I remember selling dope, police tryna set me up
On IG with the flexin', they gon wet me up
Your bitch be on my dick and she gon text me up
She texting down my line, but I ain’t texting nothin

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Durk]
I done did alotta shit
I done fucked alotta bitches
I done been through every hood
I did shot alotta niggas
I done wore alotta watches
And I robbed alotta niggas
And I did every drug
Even shot a choppa nigga

[Chorus: Lil Durk & Lil Reese]
I did alotta lotta
Did alotta lotta (bitch)
Did alotta lotta
Boy I did alotta lotta
Boy, I’m talking alotta lotta

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
I done did alotta shit
And you know who i came with
And you know what we be with
Catch a opp and change niggas
Catch a opp and change it quick
Best stay in your lane bitch, cause this shit here is dangerous
Rollin up that flamin', in the summertime over with so don’t be dangling
Leave a nigga brainless
Catch a nigga, stain 'em
Shootin' with his eyes closed, he said he was aimin'
Even when I’m famous, catch me with my niggas on the block, still hangin'
Cool yo head, it ain't safe with them shorties they’ll change you
Rearrange you

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Durk]
I done did alotta shit
I done fucked alotta bitches
I done been through every hood
I did shot alotta niggas
I done wore alotta watches
And I robbed alotta niggas
And I did every drug
Even shot a choppa nigga

[Chorus: Lil Durk & Lil Reese]
I did alotta lotta
Did alotta lotta (bitch)
Did alotta lotta
Boy I did alotta lotta
Boy, I’m talking alotta lotta
