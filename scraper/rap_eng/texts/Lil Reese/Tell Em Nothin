[Intro:]
Ay man, all these niggas thats riding
I can't tell them nothin
I can't tell them nothin

[Hook:]
Too many niggas riding, I can tell them nothin
My lil Bro'nem gone slide, I can tell you nothin
300 they gone ride, you can tell them nothin
And if you ain't sliding, I ain't gone tell them nothin
Ain't tell you nothin
Nah, ain't gone tell you nothin
So many niggas sliding, you can tell them nothin
And when it's time to ride, you can tell me nothin

[Verse 1:]
Lil bitch I'm on that money, on the money hunt
And when it's time to ride, you can tell me nothin
300 they gone silde, we gone pull right up
And when it's time to ride, you can tell us nothin
And he don't be outside, man he be put up
Call my phone, I'ma ride, I'ma pull right up
And when it's time to ride, you gone see all of us
He rapping like he street but I don't know what's up
I buy a pound for myself just to smoke it up
Just got [?] of this money finna fuck it up
We keep .30's in the cut, boy we will fuck you up
And these niggas be so tough but by themself they ain't none

[Hook:]
Too many niggas riding, I can tell them nothin
My lil Bro'nem gone slide, I can tell them nothin
300 they gone ride, you can tell them nothin
And if you ain't sliding, I ain't gone tell you nothin
Ain't tell you nothin
Nah, ain't gone tell you nothin
So many niggas sliding, you can tell them nothin
And when it's time to ride, you can tell me nothin

[Verse 2:]
Outside, I'm not inside so you know what's up
He acting like he with me, I don't know what's up
Niggas be so fishy, I don't know what's up
Too many niggas fishy, yeah I know what's up
And you can never bring me down cause I ain't down with y'all
Don't let nobody bring you down cause they don't down with you
And I'm a hound for that bread, watch me get it up
And I ain't with that acting or preteding stuff
Come holla at the gang if you fuck with us
I slide up on a nigga with my semi tuck
Don't look suspicious, don't make a move, I might just bust

[Hook:]
Too many niggas riding, I can tell them nothin
My lil Bro'nem gone slide, I can tell them nothin
300 they gone ride, you can tell them nothin
And if you ain't sliding, I ain't gone tell you nothin
Ain't tell you nothin
Nah, ain't gone tell you nothin
So many niggas sliding, you can tell them nothin
And when it's time to ride, you can tell me nothin
