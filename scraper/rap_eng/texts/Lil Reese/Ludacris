Man down

[Chorus]
This shit Ludacris
On the road with some bricks
Hop out shootin' shit
Pull up, pull up shootin’ shit
They don't know who this is
I could be anybody
Fuck around, catch a body
Robbin' is my hobby
Back then when Sosa had the Audi
Smoking so much loud, it’s cloudy
And me and Durk was on the block like shoppers
And back then we wasn't gettin' no munna
On the block, rest in peach J Munna
Better know it if you see me, it's a gun tucked
Fuck around, young nigga, then I'm gon up

[Verse]
Fuck around, young nigga, then I'm gon up
Fuck around, young nigga, then I'm gon bust
Better know it if you see me it's a gun tucked
Better know it if you see me then they gon bust
Fuck around, young nigga, we gon fuck it up
Brand new check, I’ma fuck it up
Get the money back, I’ma double up
Two for ten on the dope, shop with us
Hypes say yo' dope ain’t strong enough
Say you gettin' money, but the shit ain't long enough
This another nigga bitch, she don't belong to us
I don’t know who she is
She could be anybody
Probably fucked her, probably (probably)
Fuck with niggas, hardly (hardly)
Most of these niggas sorry (sorry)
I don't fuck with niggas, they sorry (sorry)
When you see me, know I got it on me (on me)
That mean I ain't by my lonely (my lonely)
I was raised to get that money
You was raised to be a dummy (dummy)
These niggas is actin' funny (funny)
Get the money and stack it, dummy (dummy)
Get the money and stack it, dummy (dummy)

[Chorus]
This shit Ludacris
On the road with some bricks
Hop out shootin' shit
Pull up, pull up shootin' shit
They don't know who this is
I could be anybody
Fuck around, catch a body
Robbin' is my hobby
Back then when Sosa had the Audi
Smoking so much loud, it's cloudy
And me and Durk was on the block like shoppers
And back then we wasn't gettin' no munna
On the block, rest in peach J Munna
Better know it if you see me, it's a gun tucked
Fuck around, young nigga, then I'm gon up
