[Intro: Lil Durk & Lil Reese]
Gang!
Know we mud bruddas, drug bruddas know what I'm sayin' came from the bottom
Let's get it man
Know what I'm sayin' they ain't gon' really like this shit Lil Reese
Let's get it broski
Let's make a million dollars off this tape real quick, you know
Let's get it!

[Hook: Lil Durk & Lil Reese]
Young nigga ruthless
Nigga wanna tweak I pull up with my shooters
Like a point guard, shooting guard
Caught his ass he so goofy
Why everybody wanna be shooters, these niggas be trickin'
Why you niggas not listening these niggas shootin' from a distance
Fuck nigga they gon' make me keep my distance (distance)
That sneak dissin' gon' make me keep my distance (distance)
That fake shit gon' make me keep my distance (distance)
That fuck shit gon' make me keep my pistol

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Keep my pistol, speak on the dead and my niggas gon' get you
6 shots in the nickel, got my stripe like a ref without a whistle
And I love my vultures do what they say them boys is just talkin'
Reese money hawkin', ain't no nigga in the city that'll try to stop him
Headshot made his whole brain scuplture
100 pounds let the whole hood older
Knew some older niggas peasants turned some young niggas cobras
Chase his ass face his ass, no he ain't get no pass
Erase his ass lace his ass, he know his ass is grass
100 thousand in the stash box he ever need me then he asked out
Found the plug and I cashed out
My baby momma made me lash out
Free my young nigga Beeski
Smoke a backwood with Reesey
With the muthafuckin' groupies
Know my life is movie

[Hook: Lil Durk & Lil Reese]

Why everybody wanna be shooters, these niggas be trickin'
Why you niggas not listening these niggas shootin' from a distance
Fuck nigga they gon' make me keep my distance (distance)
That sneak dissin' gon' make me keep my distance (distance)
That fake shit gon' make me keep my distance (distance)
That fuck shit gon' make me keep my pistol

[Verse 2: Lil Reese}
These niggas ain't shooters, a lot of these niggas they snitchin' they goofies
These niggas ain't stupid, talkin' like he about it but I know he ain't ruthless
And you don't want to get into it, 'cause niggas around me they'll toy with you too
And you don't wanna really do it, talkin' like you got it you can do it too
And let's get straight to it, flame with the backwood wood after wood
I know me and Durk good, now you go get out the hood not to be in the hood
And we can go back to it, but a lot of niggas can't go back to it
I'm just sayin' I'm good, I'm just sayin' we good
So much shit I can say but it can be locked today
After doin' bad I pray, I gotta thank The Lord everyday
'Cause you know where I come from it ain't safe
(After doin' bad I pray, got yo' bitch all in the wraith
She gon' do whatever I say)
Pull up, hit 'em with the K
Pull off, DOA
