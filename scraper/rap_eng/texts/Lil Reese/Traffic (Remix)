[Intro: Lil Reese]
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we 'bout that action
He not 'bout that life man, catch him in traffic

[Hook: Lil Reese]
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we 'bout that action
He not 'bout that life man, catch him in traffic
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we love that action
I lost so many niggas, I turned into a savage
In real life, no movie shit, bitch we clapping
Where Iâ€™m from? This Chiraq, you get left as a tragic
Kicked your bitch to the curb, she was too dramatic
And where I'm from that's 300, normal spelled backwards

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Got some little niggas in the Chi-Town, they ain't 'bout to be talking
Six-hundred horses in my town, cause I ain't 'bout to be walking
See I don't know what the game's about, but I ain't bout to be playing
Nigga keep my name up out your mouth, that's all the fuck that I'm saying
I ain't never been no police, I ain't never did no cuffing
Nigga killing niggas in all your rhymes, ain't never did no busting
Counting the money, took two days
Little niggas will do ya' for some new J's
Real talk, and that's nothing
Gloves on and that oven
Said she don't get the good dick often, now she 'bout to be stalking
Got her on that killer kill, and that's why the bitch coughing
See my targets flipping like Gabby, they be doing gymnastics
Nigga I ain't high and I ain't hard to find, if you look for me I'm in traffic

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
Let a nigga go in on me? I can't imagine
But I'm out here in these streets, catch me in traffic
My niggas shoot for free, they'll let you have it
My niggas do for me, ain't no way around it
Bloodhound for that money, bitch I gotta have it
Going crazy, twenties, fifties, hundreds, bitch I'm cashing
And I ain't really with the talk, bitch I'm money stacking
And he ain't really 'bout that life cause he don't love that action
And they don't come from where I come from, they weren't born a savage
Late night shit, catch him in traffic
I ain't really gotta talk, bitch catch me in traffic
And you know I got it on me, so I'm never lackin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Twista]
Lights, camera, action nigga, but this ain't no motherfucking cinema
'Finna send it up, dude not true, screws not loose
2pac, Juice nigga, hit 'em up
Niggas don't know how to argue
Killer hard shit when you see the mob thick in the whip
Now your car's hit, nigga loose lips
Talking nonsense, feel the contents of a clip
Whatever you wanna do we can take it there, niggas around me want action
Like a rhythmatic, forty calibers and nine millimeters equal subtraction
They could pull up in the Jag' with the runner on the side
Level opposition with the creep-creep
Beep beep, put 'em in a deep sleep
See the way Reese or Chief Keef make beef brief
Beast teeth, I'm a motherfucking monster
Eating up anybody that's coming at Windy City grind
What you know about them niggas pulling up on the side of your Mercedez in traffic hitting it 50 times?
Don't get into it with 'em, they gon' let you have it
You might end up in a coffin, you can call him Casket

[Hook]

[Outro: Lil Reese]
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we 'bout that action
He not 'bout that life, man catch him in traffic
