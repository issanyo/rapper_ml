[Chorus]
I gotta depend on me
Can't ask bruh, that's me
That fame where I wanna be
I'ma do whatever for me, but I ain't fucked up in these streets
Gotta maintain, that's how I be
In my own lane, that's me
Keep a few niggas with me
No switchin' up, that's me
I don't know how you be
The bullshit they talkin, doesn't even come to my knee
I'm like a linebacker, don't run that shit by me
Where would I really be?
If I ain't depend on me, how would it really be?
If I ain't depend on me, how would it really be?
If I ain't depend on me, how would it really be?
If I ain't depend on me, how would it really be?
I gotta depend on me
I gotta depend on me

[Verse]
How would it really be, if I ain't depend on me?
You only know what you done heard
That means you ain't really see (nah)
Tellin' stories like you was in the streets
In my Glory, got a big ass heat
With me (with me)
Right up on my seat (my seat)
And they'll ride, nigga with me
And they'll slide, nigga for me
I'm gettin' money, all I see, and these hoes fuckin' for free
And these hoes fuckin' for me, for me (for me)
Just spent a cool band on a sneaks (some sneaks) for me
Put on a show, show me you a freak (you a freak)
Show me what I need to see
Make me forget about these hoes
People tryna stress me in these streets
So I could show you how I'm comin'
So I could show you the real me
Sit back and count all this money
Sit back and kill all these beats
Sit back and kill all these beats
So I could show you how I'm comin'
Kill all these beats

[Chorus]
Can't ask bruh, that's me
That fame where I wanna be
I'ma do whatever for me, but I ain't fucked up in these streets
Gotta maintain, that's how I be
In my own lane, that's me
Keep a few niggas with me
No switchin' up, that's me
I don't know how you be
The bullshit they talkin, doesn't even come to my knee
I'm like a linebacker, don't run that shit by me
Where would I really be?
If I ain't depend on me, how would it really be?
If I ain't depend on me, how would it really be?
If I ain't depend on me, how would it really be?
If I ain't depend on me, how would it really be?
I gotta depend on me
I gotta depend on me
