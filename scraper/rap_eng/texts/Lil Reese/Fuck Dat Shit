[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Bitches only the family

And my rollie like a trophy, I used to live with my granny
I'ma always trick a bitch out of panties (panty)
I'ma always trick a bitch to do xannies (gang)

The nigga be broke and try to voice their opinion (for real)
Police niggas be workin', tell them niggas it ain't worth it (worth it)
