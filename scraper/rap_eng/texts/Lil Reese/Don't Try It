[Verse 1: Frenchie]
Turn my headphones up, never switch up, straight riding music
I ain't bumping your shit, y'all niggas making all kind of music
Funny ass looks, y'all niggas doing all kind of movements
You better keep to yourself, before you be looking all kind of foolish
Bang bang, nigga with a big chain
Gang band, my niggas do the same thing
Chopper letting off a cloud when that thing rain
Rob me, Dunk said we do the same thing
Hear that, get back, click clack, wrist rap
That's mine, don't try, ?
I get bread, boy you owe it
I got swag, you just stole it
You phony rappers delay
Oh you a Beastie Boy, ? bring a hurricane like the DJ
Young nigga that, young nigga this
Young nigga game, take an old nigga bit
Young nigga that, young nigga this
Young nigga game, take an old nigga bit

[Hook: Frenchie]
Boy don't try it, boy don't try it
Just because I'm in the club and my chains like lightning
Boy don't try it
Boy don't try it, boy don't try it
My niggas shooting at a ? boy, fuck that fighting
Boy don't try it
Boy don't try it, boy don't try it
Boy don't try it, boy don't try it
Boy don't try it, boy don't try it
Boy don't try it, boy don't try it

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
Boy don't try it, bitch don't try it
Two tucked when we hit the club, fuck nigga we love violence
And it's 300 over everything, so yeah bitch we whylin'
Bitch we whylin', yeah I'm rocking with the same niggas when I ain't had shit
So bitch don't try us, shit get uglier than a riot
Never switch up on my niggas, cause I got too much pride

[Hook]

[Outro: Frenchie]
Young nigga that, young nigga this
Young nigga game, take a old nigga bit
Young nigga that, young nigga this
Young nigga game, take a old nigga bit
