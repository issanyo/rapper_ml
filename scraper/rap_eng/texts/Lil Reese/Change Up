[Hook: Lil Durk]
I done seen a lotta niggas change up
I done seen a lotta niggas change up
I done seen a lotta niggas change up
I done seen a lotta niggas changed up
Changed up, changed up (Niggas changed up)
Changed up, changed up (These niggas changed up)
I done seen a lotta niggas change up (Changed up)
I done seen a lotta niggas changed up

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
Came up, I seen niggas change up
Niggas out here in the field snitchin', giving names up
And that block I come from I swear we wouldn't change nothin'
Just young hot heads who don't really give a fuck
If it ain't about money, then it ain't no nothin'
Just rolled another L, I'm bout to face another block
And my take don't take L's, I bet we give them out or something
And I'm having flashbacks it's like I've seen this shit coming
I done seen a lot of niggas change, I swear it ain't nothin'
Young niggas run around and they don't want no money
They gon' shoot anyway, get snatched don't know nothin'
Feds grabbin' niggas, watch they ass tell somethin'
L's

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
Let's get it
I done came up and niggas on the same stuff
Had to switch my circle up 'cuz that shit was dangerous
I say "change up", these niggas really change up
Playin' games with the gang, quickest way to get flamed up
I say flame up, like that shit be flame up
And I wouldn't change up, they can't change us
And all my niggas scrap, armed and dangerous
In the field we play for keeps and that shit that dangerous
See the police on speak, couple places got a beep
All my niggas in the streets and all my niggas ride for me
All my niggas in the streets and all my niggas ride with me
L's
