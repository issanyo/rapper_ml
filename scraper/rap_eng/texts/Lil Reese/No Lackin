Trapped in a club mothafucka

Lisa Raye

[Hook]

[Wale]
Lotta paper bring a lot of haters
Capiche
And the more you make
Will be the more you make
It ain't sweet (no)
Well i do me (f'sho)
Will i lose sleep (i dunno)
If i fall down before they start counting back
On my feet
Lets go
Its that flyraq meet chiraq
Theres no contest with their flow
All of my hairs out
With young dreadlocks
Couple real niggas from the go
Like i said in one song
Life is lame with no goals
Barely brag about dope
Whenever i dont you niggas ignore
Chop be cooking that crack
And talking hard rock
And talking that snow
Chop will send me that track
I send that shit back
Back of that hurst
Trapping something i know
Something i did
Just keeping it real
As a matter of fact
You never moved crack
But knowing yall routes
Prolly throw a brick bitch

[Hook]
