[Chorus]
We really did this shit that we really rap about it
We really did the shit that we cannot rap about
We been up in this shit, it ain't nothin' to brag about
Slide through the hood, you can even ask about me
And if them niggas trickin, you ain't never seen them 'round me
Most niggas bitches, I don't even want them 'round me
And I ain't with the fake shit, so I don't be around it
Had to separate myself, so I don't be around it
The killers and the hustlers, best believe they around me
Got some day one niggas, best believe they around me
And we don't play that shit, we gon kill all about it
And they don't play that shit, they gon kill all about me

[Verse]
Know a couple of Haitians, like to spray shit
Yeah, you can miss me with the hate shit
Gettin' money, back then used to take shit
Nowadays, everybody with the fake shit
And I don't wanna fuck the bitch if she basic
And if I made it, then that mean we all made it
Gettin' high, Reese Money so faded
Just rolled me a blunt and I'ma face it
Drinkin' Remy out the bottle, no chaser (nah)
And I ain't never had to fake it to make it
Most niggas gon fake it to make it
Face shot, let's see if he can take it
Ambulance ain't come, he ain't make it
And if he holdin' the low, we'll take it (we need that)
Just to show the fuck nigga we ain't fakin' (nah)
And we'll show the fuck nigga we ain't fakin'
Shoot his brains out, fuck what you thinkin'
Shoot his brains out, fuck what you thinkin'

[Chorus]
We really did this shit that we really rap about it
We really did the shit that we cannot rap about
We been up in this shit, it ain't nothin' to brag about
Slide through the hood, you can even ask about me
And if them niggas trickin, you ain't never seen them 'round me
Most niggas bitches, I don't even want them 'round me
And I ain't with the fake shit, so I don't be around it
Had to separate myself, so I don't be around it
The killers and the hustlers, best believe they around me
Got some day one niggas, best believe they around me
And we don't play that shit, we gon kill all about it
And they don't play that shit, they gon kill all about me
