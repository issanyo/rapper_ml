[Intro: Johnny Maycash]
I'm rolling shit
I'm toting shit
Bitch I'm rolling shit

[Hook: Johhny Maycash]
I'm riding round in them cars yeah they flexin'
My niggas they behind me yeah they flexin'
You run up on my niggas they be blasting
Lil niggas holding yeah they packing
And niggas they don't want nothin'
Kief said somethin'
But i ain't trying to hear nothin'
And this comma steady comin'

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
Don't run up on us bitch we blasting
That bitch she going cause I'm flexing
I ball so hard they might be flashing
Them commas coming its not question
Of course we packing its no question
I'm bout that life man it's no asking
My niggas with me so don't ask me
Put money first that bitch come last in
I'm killing shit I need a casket
Them commas coming bitch I'm flexing

[Hook]
