She ain't even my chick but she probably going
See these niggas faces when I pull up in that foreign
Maybe its my style, Maybe its my credit, she say them niggas boring
All we know is win win bitch yes we scoring
Real nigga shit 300, we don't fuck around
Bad bitches call me just to fuck around
They dont like dicks, they just like for me to dick em down
Talking bout that goofy ass niggas tryna sit em down

And we don't go back and forth like the rappers do
And they say these niggas ain't hating
