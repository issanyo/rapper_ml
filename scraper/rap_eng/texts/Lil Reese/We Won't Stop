We won't stop we won't stop we at the pressure
Just look at my squad since a youngin' we been with it
And only the strong survive and you niggas is bitches
Pull on yo block with 30's thats a mission
Pulling with my squad that a damn mission
Don't come around me not a shooter then get missing
He might be a police he working whats the business
And you niggas don't know me, they working what's the business

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]

Yo bitch gon' fuck both blocks, she know that we them niggas
Stay away from lame niggas, we don't fuck with you pretenders
Keep the heater when its cold incase we have to burn a nigga
