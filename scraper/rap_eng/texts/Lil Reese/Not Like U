[Chorus: Lil Reese]
We gettin' money, not like you
My niggas real, not like you
You a snitch nigga, we don't like you
My niggas real, not like you
My niggas real, not like you
My niggas real, not like you
My niggas real, not like you
My niggas real, not like you

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Snitch niggas, bitch niggas, that's that shit I don't like
Gotta watch my own back, fuck around and take my own life
Trap House, all green, Trap House, all white
I'ma feed that bitch a few lines, she gon suck my dick all night
Just poured a 4, no ice, heard you're broke, no life
Ain't worried about a nigga robbin' me
Cause I'm riding around with like 4 pipes
I'm with the shits, take 4 life's
That's yo bitch, smack yo wife
More pints, need more Sprites
New customers mean new white

[Chorus: Lil Reese]
We gettin' money, not like you
My niggas real, not like you
You a snitch nigga, we don't like you
My niggas real, not like you
My niggas real, not like you
My niggas real, not like you
My niggas real, not like you
My niggas real, not like you

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
Don't come from where I'm from, we might not get along
Stop fuckin' with some niggas, so how did I go wrong
I do shit on my own, fuck niggas don't want none
They snitchin' where they from?
They bitches where they from?
They not fightin', they grabbin' guns
So I guess I'ma grab my gun

[Chorus: Lil Reese]
We gettin' money, not like you
My niggas real, not like you
You a snitch nigga, we don't like you
My niggas real, not like you
My niggas real, not like you
My niggas real, not like you
My niggas real, not like you
My niggas real, not like you
