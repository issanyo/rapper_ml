(Intro)
Fired up, fired up, fired up
Fired up, fired up

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
Send me a pic, stupid bitch, so I can see what I miss
And when I up this bitch and shoot, I ain't gon' miss
Like a jump shot and that, nothin' but swish
These niggas faker than these bitches, I don't take a risk
You met that bitch the first day, and you gave her a kiss
Ain't no tellin' where her mouth been, probably on dick
Seen that nigga in the hood, he jumped right on my dick
Now I can't say you out here, boy, you ain't with the shits
Got young niggas, young niggas that will up and shit
Niggas get to duckin', niggas get to flinchin' and shit
Niggas really ain't your mans, he on that frenemy shit
Hangin' with the opps, I ain't with that friendly ass shit
And if it ain't about the money you can miss me with it
Off the drink, high'd up, and it's my party, don't come through
You might get, fired up
You might get, fired up
Dead opps up in the woods, fat woods, fired up
Fired up
Please don't come through my block you might get, fired up
Fired up
Please don't slide down my block you might get, fired up
Fired up, fired up, fired up
Dumb bitch all up on my line got me, fired up
Fired up, fired up, fired up
Please don't serve down my block you might get, fired up
Fired up
Ten grams up in a backwood watch my nigga, fire it up
Fire it up, fire it up, fire it up

(Outro)
You feel me?
Slide down my block shit get very dangerous
Shit get very scary
Make shit very scary
Foe nem
