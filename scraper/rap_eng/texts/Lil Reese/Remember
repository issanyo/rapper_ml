[Verse]
Nowadays in the streets, this shit so wicked
Your own mans'll get you get you clapped, boy
You thought he was with it
Hittin' blocks, spinnin' blocks, still ride with my niggas
Actin' like they with it, but niggas ain't with it
Stop playin', I put one in your fitted
Put them niggas on your ass, now you bitchin'
Jumpin' and flinchin, 30 in the Glock, it's extension
Never needed niggas co-sign, took the fam if I'm real
Your bitch fat up in that dress, she dressin' to kill
Make a nigga wanna touch it just to see if it's real
See if it's real, let a nigga know what's the deal
I took her home the first night
She let me fuck, yeah it's real

[Chorus]
I remember, I remember who was with it (who was with it)
Do you remember, do you remember who was with it?
Nowadays everybody fake with it (fake with it)

Nowadays everybody fake with it (fake with it)
Fake with it (fake with it)

[Verse 2]
One time for the niggas, who out here with it
I love my niggas, cause I ain't gotta question if they with it
I can look up at a nigga and tell if he really with it
And if I start some shit, then guarentee that I'ma finish
And if you start some shit, I really hope that you could finish
You better not start some shit, that you can't even really finish
We fly as hell in the latest, you know that we be trendin'
Why would I leave my niggas?
They been with me since the beginnin'
Try us lil nigga, and it's gon be a sad endin'
Gotta watch them niggas who ain't happy when you winnin'
Nigga say he your mans, but he ain't happy when you winnin'
Stop playin'
I been with the shits since the beginnin'

[Chorus]
I remember, I remember who was with it (who was with it)
Do you remember, do you remember who was with it?
Nowadays everybody fake with it (fake with it)
Fake with it (fake with it)
Fake with it (fake with it)
I remember, I remember who was with it (who was with it)
Do you remember, do you remember who was with it?
Do you remember, do you remember who was with it?
Yeah I remember, yeah I remember who was with it
Nowadays everybody fake with it (fake with it)
Fake with it (fake with it)
Fake with it (fake with it)
Yeah I remember, I remember who was with it (who was with it)
