[Hook: Lil Reese]
I promise niggas bitches man, they gone tell it all
I promise to keep it real and still fuck with my dawgs
I always burn up, I can't change at all
I always burn up, i can't change at all
And when they switch up, I can't change at all
And when it go up, I don't know nothing, seen or saw
And when it go down, I don't know nothing, seen or saw
And when it go down, I don't know nothing, seen or saw

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
I don't know nothing, seen or saw, Who talkin' to the law
Got a gun on me, don't test it
This bitch here it go off
Tryin' to stack my money up and buy a big ass crib
So I can build me a motherfuckin' golf, course
On the back of my shit, killas in the back of the whip
Flip by once, Flip by twice
I can't get no action for shit
Im'a go back to the script, and a nigga like me, me knowin' me
Im'a just stick to the script, im'a just stick to the script
Fuck a bitch and dip off the rip, R.I.P to my niggas not here
I'ma ride for my niggas that's here
War time with my niggas right here
It's going down with my niggas right here

[Hook: Lil Reese]
I promise niggas bitches man, they gone tell it all
I promise to keep it real and still fuck with my dawgs
I always burn up, I can't change at all
I always burn up, i can't change at all
And when they switch up, I can't change at all
And when it go up, I don't know nothing, seen or saw
And when it go down, I don't know nothing, seen or saw
And when it go down, I don't know nothing, seen or saw

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Young nigga fuck what ya seen, now they say you a witness
Never speakin' no evil so I just pray for forgiveness
We may trip and may stumble but never fall in these trenches
Once you're labeled a snitch, you may get wiped on suspicion
Never stand on the same [?] exercise my potential
Miss me with them Twitter rants and come and get this extended
I'm mighty might, [?]
I be down at the lot, European four door
Infatuated by the tales of the older dope boys
Years later look at me, I'm on my fourteenth Rolls Royce
Fairy tales is what they call it, I can tell you what I got
I really came up from the bottom so I take it off the top
