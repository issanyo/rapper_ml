[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Where your trap nigga
My shit be on Frontstreet
Where my niggas tote heat
And they be on dummy
Where yo trap nigga
My shit be on 61st
And my niggas put in work
And my niggas selling work
Where yo trap nigga (8x)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Where yo trap at
Send a couple shooters
Where your trap at
Where your kids and-
Your wife take a nap at
Louie this Louie that
Got thirty in the Louie knapsack
I trap on 300 no location
I be peeping these niggas be hating
Indeed I go crazy
And I put that on nation
Whip out the pot
Look at the flick of the wrist
Vision of future
But how could I not
I ain't no plug
But I could not front
Got Fredo got the weight
Posted on the front
Count my only spot
Back to the front
We get jammed up
Out in a month
I'm the man and I could stunt
See my trap house it go cray
We counting money everyday
Got lil' bags
Nigga get up out the way
Where I trap at we don't play
And the trap house going crazy

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Where your trap nigga
My shit be on Frontstreet
Where my niggas tote heat
And they be on dummy
Where yo trap nigga
My shit be on 61st
And my niggas put in work
And my niggas selling work
Where yo trap nigga (8x)

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
It's a scary sight
Pop out the cut of your trap nigga
We ain't no rap niggas
You better adapt nigga
Getting to that money
Yes I adapt nigga
Always with my niggas
And they down and out niggas
These fuck niggas lash us
We done lap niggas
Me and Durk and Fredo going crazy lap niggas
We fucked this bitch up in the week
Because she like rap niggas
All us down to catch a homi(cide)
Cause we keep scraps nigga
Can't serve yo ass up in the front
So pull in the back nigga
On my trap nigga (2x)
Don't fuck with rat niggas
Don't fuck with that nigga
At my trap nigga (2x)

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Where your trap nigga

[Verse 3: Fredo Santana]
Trap house going crazy
Jumping stupid hard
[?] to the money
We be supercharged
Xanax after Xanax
I need another bar
All these thots sucking us
It's 'coz we some superstars
Durk got the tec(h-9)
Reese got the ak(47)
Don't make us pull up
Shooting shit in broad day
Trap house boom
Fiends in the hallway
Ain't no robbing us
Keep guns all day
Look me in my face
See that I'm a trap nigga
You will tell on a case
You ain't a trap nigga
I'm a trap nigga (2x)
Frontstreet, 61st, where my trap nigga!
