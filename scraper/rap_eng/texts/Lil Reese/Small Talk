[Chorus]
Small talk, save the convo
No, I ain't with the fuckin' convo
Keep talking, we gon pull up pronto
That's ASAP boy, like Rocky nigga
How the fuck you rockin' nigga?
You know how we rockin' nigga
I heard some funny shit about you
So I ain't fuckin' with you

[Verse 1]
Fuck the small talk, let's get money
'Lot of my shooters, boy, they on dummy
'Lot of my niggas, boy, they on dummy
That's why I all I think about is money
Boy, I'ma get it
Fuck niggas if they ain't with it
All my niggas, yeah they been with it
Cause a lot of niggas really bitches
Ain't came up where I came from
That's like me forgetting where I came from
Rolled up, go back where I came from
I won't switch up on my day ones

[Chorus]
Small talk, save the convo
No, I ain't with the fuckin' convo
Keep talking, we gon pull up pronto
That's ASAP boy, like Rocky nigga
How the fuck you rockin' nigga?
You know how we rockin' nigga
I heard some funny shit about you
So I ain't fuckin' with you

[Verse 2]
Know your role, no flexin' though
It's 300 just to let you know
With Lamron, they get everything whole
We erase a nigga just let you know
Chasing money, I ain't chasing hoes
24/7, yeah we on go
Yeah, we on go
Ain't playing roles
Niggas getting exposed
Most niggas hoe's
That's how it go
But I'm from the foe
I can't go, ask lil bro
He tote poles, we tote poles
He kick doors, we kick doors
On Lil Mo

Homie ain't switch up for shit though
Fu niggas do fu shit though
Police grab me, what's this though?
Better know my mouth zipped though

[Chorus]
Small talk, save the convo
No, I ain't with the fuckin' convo
Keep talking, we gon pull up pronto
That's ASAP boy, like Rocky nigga
How the fuck you rockin' nigga?
You know how we rockin' nigga
I heard some funny shit about you
So I ain't fuckin' with you
