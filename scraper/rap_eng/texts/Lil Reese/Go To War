[Intro: Fredo]
Bitches say I'm handsome kidnap yo ass for ransom
Finna be a killa season let me call up Cam'ron

[Hook: Fredo]
If it's a problem let me know lil' nigga
We can go to war
In the kitchen stretching work my nigga
Whipping with the fork
Say it short got it all my nigga
But we can work it out
Turn a two into a fo' my nigga
It ain't hard at all

[Verse 1: Fredo]
The way I tote my gun, you would think I was James Bond
Come to my trap its at least 'bout thirty guns
Come to the trap she giving head I'm in the bathroom
Nigga disrespect leave em wet bloodied in a tampon
Bitches say I'm handsome kidnap your ass for ransom
Its finna be a killa season let me call up Cam'ron
Just flew from over seas nigga just to meet my damn plug
My shooters shoot for no reason you don't wanna wit them boy

[Hook]
If it's a problem let me know lil' nigga
We can go to war
In the kitchen stretching work my nigga
Whipping with the fork
Say it short got it all my nigga
But we can work it out
Turn a two into a fo' my nigga
It ain't hard at all

[Bridge: Lil Reese]
If its a problem let me know my nigga we gon' solve em all
We got thirties we got choppers we got handguns we got revolvers and all (the foes and all)
You want no problems over here nigga, and we don't go by the law (nah)
All them problems are getting solved nigga, and it ain't hard at all (nah)

[Hook]
If it's a problem let me know lil' nigga
We can go to war
In the kitchen stretching work my nigga
Whipping with the fork
Say it short got it all my nigga
But we can work it out
Turn a two into a fo' my nigga
It ain't hard at all
