Shoutout to my competition
I mean there's no competition
Look up man I know we winning
Haters mad cause they ain't in it
We tote 30's, we love sinning
Fucked all these hoes, man we hit plenty
Don't talk about money cause I done made plenty
Now shoutout to my competition
You say you on that, you better have that with you
Shooters on deck that a kill that issue
Acting like you with it that's the quickest way to get you
$1500 on a belt like it ain't a big issue
Same niggas in the same hood
Got real niggas with me, plus we official
And we shooting shit and we ain't tryna miss you
This a message to the Opps, miss me with the dissing
Fuck his bitch now he sneak dissing
Pull up with the windows tinted
So the haters can't really see who in it
300
