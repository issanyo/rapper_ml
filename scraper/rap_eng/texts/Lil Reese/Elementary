[Chorus]
Been doing this shit since elementary
You ain't a ten year nigga then you ain't shit to me
(You ain't shit to me nigga)
I ain't yo homie I ain't yo bro you ain't kin to me
A lot of niggas they snake they call them frienemies
I be getting to the money man fuck my enemies
I only roll backwoods when I smoke my enemies
Stay busting off bitch I love that ecstasy
We been doing this shit since elementary

[Verse 1]
Just ask them bitch I'm really in the skreets
We been doing this shit since elementary
You ain't no fifteen year nigga you ain't shit to me
Neck shot, headshot I leave his brains up in the skreets
Niggas be acting so crazy
Although niggas ain't really so crazy
Who that lil bitch I then fucked yo o'lady
You don't work then yo dumb ass must be lazy
Rolling off 5th with bro nem we going crazy
All that hatin' shit that shit don't faze me
Fuck is you crazy her head amazing
But I would not chase bitch is so basic
And it's ten grams that I wore when I smoked my enemy
All these niggas so foo I call them frienemies
Who you, you just got up in the skreets
Most niggas they bitches they ain't really in the skreets

[Chorus]
Been doing this shit since elementary
You ain't a ten year nigga then you ain't shit to me
(You ain't shit to me nigga)
I ain't yo homie I ain't yo bro you ain't kin to me
A lot of niggas they snake they call them frienemies
I be getting to the money man fuck my enemies
I only roll backwoods when I smoke my enemies
Stay busting off bitch I love that ecstasy
We been doing this shit since elementary

[Verse 2]
Been toting that forty since I was a shorty
When I was fifteen had a clip that was twice my age
Had a different gun for a different day
Shoot his block up different ways
I'm 100 x 6 ain't switching ways
In a foreign with yo bitch u be switching lanes
Smoked a new pack yo homie got cooked today
Keep a backwood when I roll I stay off my enemies
Want a feature from blow it's gone be about a key
When I was down on my ass man you wasn't friends with me
One shot headshot took him out like Kennedy
Baby these niggas ain't crazy
30 on me like I was born in the 80's
Racks in my pocket I know that they hate it
Telling mama I know I'ma make it
Way I was raised
They know I was gone take it
Alot of these rappers they lying, they faking
Loving that bitch but to me she so basic
Black on black crime so my Glock is so racist

[Chorus]
Been doing this shit since elementary
You ain't a ten year nigga then you ain't shit to me
(You ain't shit to me nigga)
I ain't yo homie I ain't yo bro you ain't kin to me
A lot of niggas they snake they call them frienemies
I be getting to the money man fuck my enemies
I only roll backwoods when I smoke my enemies
Stay busting off bitch I love that ecstasy
We been doing this shit since elementary
