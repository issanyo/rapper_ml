[Hook: Chief Keef]
I kill you niggas dead in this rap shit
She gave me some head cause this rap shit
All these niggas dead in this rap shit
I do this for my daughter in this rap shit
I love countin' money cause this rap shit
Don't be no dummy cause this rap shit
Buying TEC-9's and Tommy's with this rap shit
Sosa bitch, I be with this rap shit

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
All my niggas thirsty for this rap shit
Kush grown and I'm with a thick bitch
I kill these niggas dead in this rap shit
I bend these niggas dead in this rap shit
All my niggas reckless and get hectic
So don't be no dummy cause I'm rappin'
My niggas down, my niggas fuck this rap shit
And not ever change cause I'm rappin'
So don't get me confused with this rap shit
Buying TEC-9's and 30's with this rap shit
Louis, Gucci, got it all off of rappin'
I killed these niggas dead in this rap shit

[Hook: Chief Keef]

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
Made a lot of haters off this rap shit
Riding by myself cause I don't trust a bitch
She gave me some head cause this rap shit
On the road to get this bread, like traffic
And bitch I'm in the streets, I'm in traffic
Riding with my heat, I'm in traffic
A lot of bitches thirsty cause I'm rappin'
But it's fuck a bitch, on to the next bitch
And the next bitch, next bitch

[Hook]
