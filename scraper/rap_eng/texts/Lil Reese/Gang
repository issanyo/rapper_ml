[Intro]
Steady ride with my niggas, I be slidin' with my niggas
It's war time, first in line with my niggas, on the line with my niggas
I be slidin' with my niggas, steady ride with my niggas
Gang!
Steady ride with my niggas, I be slidin'  with my niggas
It's war time, first in line with my niggas, on the line with my niggas
I be slidin' with my niggas, steady ride with my niggas
Gang!

[Verse 1]
We gon' say shit when it's that time, my nigga
War time, first I lie with my niggas, I'ma lie with my niggas
Get outta line, my nigga
Put you back in it like it's school time, my nigga
Overgrind on a nigga, overshine on a nigga
I guess had to put in overtime on a nigga
Got my money on my mind, ain't got my mind on no bitch
Got the G-A-N-G with me, don't ask me who with it
And you ain't really with it, actin' like you with it, that's the quickest way to get it, niggas really bitches
The-They ain't really with it, actin' like they get it, that's the quickest way to get it
.45, cock back, bullets steady spitting

[Bridge: Sample]

[Verse 2]
Huh?
And this a eye for a eye, so I'm watching every nigga
Huh?
And this a eye for a eye, so I'm ridin' with my niggas
Slidin' with my niggas
Nina got the best sex, call her Aquafina
Caught the niggas snoozing and they did it like they mean it
Niggas steady sleeping, niggas steady dreamin'
I'ma stay up, nigga, I ain't never sleep
Up, up like I'm gekin'
Set the party up, we sayin' opps, we was tweakin'
(Set the party up, we sayin' opps, we was tweakin')
And when we see cops, best believe we ain't speakin'
When niggas see cops, best believe they be speakin'
I guess I be tweakin'

[Outro: Sample]
