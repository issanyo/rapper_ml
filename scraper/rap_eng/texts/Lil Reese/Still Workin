[Intro x8]
Still working
And they still talking

[Verse]
Niggas working
Man these niggas talking
I guess that's why I'm by myself more often
When you be broke
Ain't nobody gon give you nothing
Best get it on your own and get you something
Remember the days I ain't have shit, walking
I do this shit by myself
No talking
Naw I ain't stressing
I'm just thinking money
Niggas that talk be folding when them people on em
Tote that bitch like its legal on me
They say you change when you get plenty money
Switch up and get to acting funny
No I won't change on my people, huh
Bout them flames
That we keep on coming
My phone tapped I think the people on it
My line tapped I think the people on it

[Hook]
Still working
And they still talking
