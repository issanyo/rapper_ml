[Intro]
Hello, thank you

[Hook: Ballout]
Can't you tell I got guap, can't ya tell?
Can't you tell I'm from the block, can't ya tell?
Can't you tell, that this bitch I'm with, bag and shoes Chanel
Can't you tell, by the smell, that this weed is loud as hell
Can't you tell, why my name Ballout, cause I like to ball
Shopping malls, I dont even stall, can't you tell at all
Can't you tell why these niggas hating on me, cause they fake as hell
Can't you tell, I'm from the mud, If it wasn't for so I'd be in jail
Doing 12, Fuck 12
Fuck 12

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
Can't ya tell I'm from the block bitch can't ya tell?
The kush I smoke, it be loud, can't you smell
