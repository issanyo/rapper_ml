Money over bitches
I gotta get this cash
I'mma call a play and they gon' think we passing
Every time I skate I see them niggas hating (Skirrt)
They know we running lines
I call it Walter Payton, Walter Payton
Why they be fakin
Alot of Niggas say they real but they fakin
I call it Walter Payton, Walter Payton
They know we running lines

[Lil Reese: Verse 1]
Walter Payton
Why they be fakin
A lot of niggas say the real
