[Intro]
Chopsquad
Lil bro shot in the crowd
I think he painted a nigga
The nigga came through with the tape
I think he wasted a nigga
Damn
Hold up, ay

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
I ain't gone play with you niggas
I ain't gone play with you niggas
I'm not gone play with you niggas
Ain't finna play with you niggas
You know the niggas that's dying
I know the niggas that did it
I know the niggas that's solid
You know the niggas that's snitching
I ain't gone play with you niggas
I'm not finna play with you niggas
I ain't bout to play with you niggas
I ain't gone play with you niggas
Them niggas got you with you pussy
These niggas I got with me with it
It ain't no point in you hiding
I want you, I'ma come get you
I ain't gone play with you niggas

[Verse: Tee Grizzley]
I ain't gone play with you niggas
You know not to play with me, nigga
You know I been waitin' on niggas
You know where I'm takin' it, nigga
You upped a hoe on the gram (I'm on it)
I hope you ain't takin' her serious
We see em, we takin' them bitches
Took me some molly and slayed me a nigga
You know Gang-Gang dropped him
You ain't gone do shit about it
I got that K in my closet
Niggas don't want no drama
Not finna play with nobody
Not finna sit in no County
Call up a good bail bondsman
Know he got money in property

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
I ain't gone play with you niggas
I ain't gone play with you niggas
I'm not gone play with you niggas
Ain't finna play with you niggas
You know the niggas that's dying
I know the niggas that did it
I know the niggas that's solid
You know the niggas that's snitching
I ain't gone play with you niggas
I'm not finna play with you niggas
I ain't bout to play with you niggas
I ain't gone play with you niggas
Them niggas got you with you pussy
These niggas I got with me with it
It ain't no point in you hiding
I want you, I'ma come get you
I ain't gone play with you niggas

[Verse: Lil Reese]
Creep up and lay on a nigga
I ain't finna play with you niggas
Have lil bro nem sprayin' at niggas
Your best bet just keepin' your distance cause me and my niggas we stay with them pistols
See you with them niggas that's hiding and I'm with them niggas sliding and riding
And when it's that time to ride, them niggas ain't gone be nowhere by your side
Never had a 9 to 5, I always hustled and got on my grind
And when it come to mine, nigga ain't taking none of mine
I ain't finna play with you niggas, I'ma shoot this bitch like 100 times

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
I ain't gone play with you niggas
I ain't gone play with you niggas
I'm not gone play with you niggas
Ain't finna play with you niggas
You know the niggas that's dying
I know the niggas that did it
I know the niggas that's solid
You know the niggas that's snitching
I ain't gone play with you niggas
I'm not finna play with you niggas
I ain't bout to play with you niggas
I ain't gone play with you niggas
Them niggas got you with you pussy
These niggas I got with me with it
It ain't no point in you hiding
I want you, I'ma come get you
I ain't gone play with you niggas
