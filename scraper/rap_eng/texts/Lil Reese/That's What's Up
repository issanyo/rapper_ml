[Hook]
Pull off in a foreign, that's what's up
All these hoes going, nigga that's what's up
I got my own weed nigga, that's what's up
Don't need to hit your shit nigga, that's what's up
All my niggas with me, nigga that's what's up
Don't fuck with fuck niggas, nigga that's what's up
I'm a real nigga, that's what's up
Ain't fucking with no squares nigga, that's what's up.

[Verse]
Ain't fucking with no squares nigga and that's what's up
The police at the nose, say put your hands up
Me know I'm me, I'm dirty as fuck so I hit the cut
Ain't try to see the county or that other stuff
Free my niggas in the county for that other stuff
Me I know me, I try to make the money jump
He playing games, we fuck around, put him in the trunk
We got F and N's, we got mac 10s, how you want it boy
Only fucking with the  gang nigga, that's what's up
We ain't fucking with no lames nigga and that's what's up
On the block everyday nigga, that's what's up
Your foreign car ride pass it get fed up

[Hook]
Pull off in a foreign, that's what's up
All these hoes going, that's what's up
I got my own weed nigga, that's what's up
Don't need to hit your shit nigga, that's what's up
All my niggas with me, nigga that's what's up
I'm a real nigga, that's what's up
Ain't fucking with no squares nigga, that's what's up
