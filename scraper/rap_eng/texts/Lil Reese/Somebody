[Hook: Lil Durk]
I aim at a nigga 'cuz this
Rollie on me, I whipped it to a brick
No one, smoke a nigga if he trip
No hope for my city I was in
Free Law judge gave him more than ten
Hard body, can't none of my niggas bend
And we trend, all of my niggas is brothers, we don't do friends
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Where I'm from you nobody
So you kill somebody, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Growing up, I ain't wanna be nobody
Had to get it on my own, I swear muthafucka that I don't need nobody
Supa Savage 2 shit, might make him catch a body
Lockdown, phone calls to the fam, I ain't really need nobody
Not a bitch, not a nigga, not nobody
No hope for the city I'm in
Niggas hatin', they don't want you to win
Hard body, we can take it there again
One call, they get slapped in advance
Niggas actin', they be really out here playin'
I guess if it's slow, he'll get what I'm sayin'
Slow down, let me bring it back again
Niggas actin', they be really out here playin
I'm goin' in for the kill once again
Rob who? I don't get what you're sayin'
Take what? I don't get what you're sayin'
These niggas my brothers, not my friends
They came up, they wanted watches when
It's fucked up 'cuz that nigga you thought was your man
Might snitch and get you a hundred years
Might snitch and get you a hundred years

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Everybody wanna be a somebody, but
Everybody, we wanna body some
As a kid growing up I ain't had nothin'
I just wanted a lot of guns and a lot of money
6217 where I'm at work
No school, better stay with his Macbook
On my son, Aqua
I hash .30 shot, .40 Ruger like Jackfoot
Some niggas want to be like Mike, shit I wanna be like Big Durk
Flat as hell, flat bitches with some flat car
I swear Allah had a rich word
Choppa bullets, man down
I told my momma I'm the man now
I got the city' hands down
My young boys they ain't playin' round
Free [?] he go "blam!"
Free Rich, free Jam
My young niggas, they all go ham
Free Lil boon from the Lam
I'm the man now
I got the city' hands down

[Hook: Lil Durk]

Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
