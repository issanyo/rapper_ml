4 5 cocked back
Bullets flying like snapbacks
My niggas they round cats
Broski push his top back
That Irene that loud pack
Weed got my pockets fat
We posted up
We on that
We ridin' round, we getting that
Quick stain we hittin' that
64th and Normal be the block you can't miss that
Shooters we don't point
Bitch we ballin and we ain't miss shots
Fucked her, passed her to my dawgs
Whole team hit that
Little niggas they lying
They ain't drilling
They ain't shooting shit
Catch his ass lose a leg
Nike I'm the 30 back
Finna put my team on my back
I'm a running back
And I'll put my last up
That 300 ain't having that
We drilling shit
We drilling shit
Period
