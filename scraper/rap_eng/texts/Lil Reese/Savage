[Verse 1: Kur]
Ladder on me, I bring it
Swangin' coupe then I'm swanging
I'm from the shit, they ship me the stages
Grab a 8 ball and shave it
Pop a stove, get a razor
Back in Arizona at the table
Pass the pans, we been scraping
Baking soda, baking pastry
Treat it like the 80s, running road babies
Sharp knife nigga, bitches can't play me
Fuck a Mercedes, Glock got a laser
Make me go crazy, hop out start spraying
Everyday blazing, everyday shrimping pasta, that's Asian
Everyday low top sneakers, that's Mason's
Pill popper, I'm a addict
Double G's make me active
Purple drank I gotta have it
.30 on me, that's a trap
We was waiting on the package
Just to break it into fragments
Young nigga I'm a savage (young nigga I'm a savage)

[Hook: Kur]
Young nigga I'm a savage, young nigga with a ladder
Young nigga I'm a savage, niggas wan't it, let em have it
Young nigga I'm a savage, young nigga I'm a savage
Young nigga I'm a savage, niggas wan't it, let em have it
Young nigga I'm a savage, young nigga I'm a savage
Young nigga with a ladder, niggas wan't it, let em have it
Young nigga I'm a savage, young nigga I'm a savage
Young nigga I'm a savage, Young nigga I'm a savage

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
Young nigga I'm a savage, riding round with a ratchet
Fuck around if you have it, fuck around and get tragic
Catch me off in traffic, best believe I got it
Catch his ass in traffic, jamming that automatic
Up [?] status, known for catching niggas lackin'
50 drum automatic, I won't miss bitch I got it
In the field with that ratchet, still selling Knicks for them Jackson's
Ben Franklin's, I gotta have it
How you want it, you can have it
What you need, bitch I got it
Still selling fiends to crack addicts
Gun stuffed in the attic, young nigga I'm a savage
Young nigga with a ladder, gun stuffed in the sweater
Young nigga won't sweat her, young nigga go get here

[Hook: Kur]
Young nigga I'm a savage, young nigga with a ladder
Young nigga I'm a savage, niggas wan't it, let em have it
Young nigga I'm a savage, young nigga I'm a savage
Young nigga I'm a savage, niggas wan't it, let em have it
Young nigga I'm a savage, young nigga I'm a savage
Young nigga with a ladder, niggas wan't it, let em have it
Young nigga I'm a savage, young nigga I'm a savage
Young nigga I'm a savage, Young nigga I'm a savage
