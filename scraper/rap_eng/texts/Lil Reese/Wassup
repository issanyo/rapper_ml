[Chorus: Lil Reese]
What's up with all these fuck niggas

They fake as fuck, man, I can't trust niggas

Wassup with all these fuck niggas
Too many faces, I can't trust niggas

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
What's up with all these fuck niggas
I'm getting money, I can't trust niggas
I grab my 30 if you a little bigger
He pillow-talking, that's for bitches, nigga
Your bitch want me, I pass her to my niggas
Got so much swag, these hoes, they feel a nigga
We bought more choppers cause the streets got realer
Ain't never seen you, so I ain't gone serve you, nigga
What's up with all these fuck niggas
And we play for keeps so it's no worries with us
And we shooting this shit, this a true story, nigga
I'm Glory'd up, I'm in my glory, nigga

[Chorus: Lil Reese]

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
I'm big boss Fredo, what's up with all of these fuck niggas
Trap house full of crack, them pillow cases stuffed, nigga
I don't fuck with fuck niggas, fuck with me, you get trunked, nigga
Step up in the club, bet none of us get touched, nigga
All us got 30s, we let them bitches bust, nigga
All us got 30s, we let them bitches bust, nigga
Got a young nigga that's 15, and all he do is slump niggas
Young nigga that's 15 and all he do is slump niggas
Dissing us, you drunk nigga? Your whole squad full of punk niggas
Don't make me grab that pump, nigga, turn y'all to some skunk niggas

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
I'm toting, folk and 'em on pill, they rolling
We lurking, see 'em on 'em, headshot, told little bro "Dome him"
Cause little bro' keep it on him, he shoot, he shoot, he blowing
Face shot, so ain't no viewing, closed casket, ain't no face
No face, it ain't no case, police, it ain't no trace
That's why I use the 8, sometimes I use the 30
That's when we do 'em dirty, that mean we show no mercy
That loud, that pipe be perfect, ain't a nigga perfect
Don't be no dummy, boy
A lot of niggas paranoid
Free bro and 'em in the slammer, boy
Free bro and 'em in the slammer, boy

[Chorus: Lil Reese]
What's up with all these fuck niggas
What's up with all these fuck niggas
They fake as fuck, man, I can't trust niggas
300, it's just us, nigga
What's up with all these fuck niggas
They fake as fuck, man, I can't trust niggas
Wassup with all these fuck niggas
Too many faces, I can't trust niggas
