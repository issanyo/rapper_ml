Get the money (get the money, get the money)
And try an make a flip
Bust a move, whole team make it flip
Get it back, hell naw i ain't trip
You wit them?, hell naw i ain’t wit them
You know them?, hell naw ion know them
So don’t mix me up with the fu shit
Fuck around, i’ll have to lose it
Landlord of the bunk, you gotta move bitch
And these niggas must be stupid
Ain’t worried bout you and what you doin bitch
Got a lil one out here and she need shit
Nah mean she ain’t really gone need shit
He caught a case same day outta the shit
He said the police ain’t charge'em wit shit
Naw we don’t want nothing to do wit it (naw we don’t want nothing to do wit it, nothing to do wit it)
Naw we don’t want nothing to do wit it (nothing to do wit it)
