[Chorus]
Niggas plottin', niggas snakes, so I keep it with me
And all my niggas on go, fuck who ain't with me
And we gon' let the world know, it ain't a fuckin' secret
We gon' get some get back
Ain't stoppin' til you hear that click-clack
Man down on your fuckin' set
Got to get my money up, I'ma get that
And I really for all that chit-chat
Ain't stoppin' til we get it, that's some get back
Ain't stoppin' til I get me a big sack
Hatin' shit, no I ain't really with that
But I can see it in your face that you with that
Switched up on your mans, I ain't with that
I'ma stick to the plan, yeah I'm with that
Yeah, I'm with that
I'ma stick to the plan, yeah I'm with that
I'ma stick the plan, yeah I'm with that


[Verse]
I'ma stick to the plan
Got to be smarter than the next man, I'm just sayin'
Tryna run my M's up, fuck some bands
And I ain't out if I ain't really got a plan
Ridin' round, I'm gettin' high, I'm just sayin'
Ridin' with the same niggas since the sand
And we'll put you in a box if you playin'
Wanna box, we can fight like a man
Put the guns down and fight like a man
I was burned you won't see this shit again
I got a lot of niggas cooked in the can
I caught a case, I'm like "never again"
They won't catch me like that, I'm just sayin'
And I can still go back on my land
[?] you go back on your land
I don't give a fuck the nigga ain't my mans

[Chorus]
Niggas plottin', niggas snakes, so I keep it with me
And all my niggas on go, fuck who ain't with me
And we gon' let the world know, it ain't a fuckin' secret
We gon' get some get back
Ain't stoppin' til you hear that click-clack
Man down on your fuckin' set
Got to get my money up, I'ma get that
And I really for all that chit-chat
Ain't stoppin' til we get it, that's some get back
Ain't stoppin' til I get me a big sack
Hatin' shit, no I ain't really with that
But I can see it in your face that you with that
Switched up on your mans, I ain't with that
I'ma stick to the plan, yeah I'm with that
Yeah, I'm with that
I'ma stick to the plan, yeah I'm with that
I'ma stick the plan, yeah I'm with that
