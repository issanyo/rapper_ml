[Hook]
Came up and still come around
Now they say you don't come around
Same niggas you grew up with
Come around, can't trust shit
Too many niggas be shystie
Cut 'em off, it ain't right with me
Same niggas you bust at
Same niggas I bust at
Imma line 'em up, let's see
Imma cut you in, that's me
Catch a case, we ain't coppin no plea
We gon' fight it all the way till it's beat
I don't know about you, know about me
Can't go that way, no it ain't me
Shit in the streets, broski, keep it in the streets

[Verse 1]
Came up, I still come around
A lot of niggas don't come around
When I ain't around, they still talkin' down
Leave that shit up to the clowns
If he ain't around, I ain't talkin' down
Heard he ain't even been in the town
(Heard he ain't even been in the town)
Next subject, I gotta get it now
Cut 'em off, it ain't right with me
Lil bad bitch spend a night with me
But she can only get one night with me
That fu shit, miss me
Fuck nigga keep your distance
I don't wanna know who snitch
(I don't wanna know who snitch)

[Hook]
Came up and still come around
Now they say you don't come around
Same niggas you grew up with
Come around, can't trust shit
Too many niggas be shystie
Cut 'em off, it ain't right with me
Same niggas you bust at
Same niggas I bust at
Imma line 'em up, let's see
Imma cut you in, that's me
Catch a case, we ain't coppin no plea
We gon' fight all the way till it's beat
I don't know about you, know about me
Can't go that way, no it ain't me
Shit in the streets, broski, keep it in the streets

[Verse 2]
If the shit in the streets, I'ma keep it in the streets
No I ain't gon' tweet
Nigga I'ma be me
Ain't puttin on a show, this shit ain't free
The older, the wiser
I rather just surprise 'em
Ainâ€™t boostin, I'm braggin
Got a stain on a couple P's
If you want war ain't no peace
Fuck nigga don't want beef
I'm out here, no hide and seek

[Hook]
Came up, still come around
Now they say you don't come around
Same niggas you grew up with
Come around, can't trust shit
Too many niggas be shystie
Cut 'em off, it ain't right with me
Same niggas you bust at
Same niggas I bust at
Imma line 'em up, let's see
Imma cut you in, that's me
Catch a case, we ain't coppin no plea
We gon' fight it all the way till it's beat
I don't know about you, know about me
Can't go that way, no it ain't me
Shit in the streets, broski, keep it in the streets
