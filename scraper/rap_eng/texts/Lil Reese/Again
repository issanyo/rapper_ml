[Hook: Lil Reese]
What you do this for? In it to win
I lose that shit, get it back again
Rewind that shit, I'll do it again
Two Glocks, them bitches look like twins
I'll pull up, poppin' that two at your mans
Flip by once, flip by twice again
Flip by once, flip by twice again
Flip by once, flip by twice again

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
Ain't nothin' nice
Flip by once, flip by twice
You get spiced like cookin' rice
Meant for the bitch, if the bitch my type
If the bitch is my type, then she get one night
Posted on my block and I got my pipe
Ounce after ounce got me high all night
Fo'nem off the flat got me high like a height
And if the pockets flat, I gotta get it right
I know this shit ain't right
You'll get left, on the step
I don't need no help
Yeah fuck nigga I'll run up on him by myself
When it was hard times
Who the fuck I have? Myself
Fake niggas gonna sneak diss
You can keep that there
Me switchin' up on my mans?
Boy, that shit's so rare
A lot of niggas say they real, but them niggas ain't real
A lot of niggas say they real, but them niggas ain't real

What you do this for? In it to win
I lose that shit, get it back again
Rewind that shit, I'll do it again
Two Glocks, them bitches look like twins
I'll pull up, poppin' that two at your mans
Flip by once, flip by twice again
Flip by once, flip by twice again
Flip by once, flip by twice again

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
You are no street
You don't know nothin' 'bout beef
Go 'head give me a 40
I got it all on my teeth, nigga
To see the gang, you need to see me, nigga
Like a CC, weed in the reef, nigga
I eat, sleep, shit with my gat
Feelin' like Memphis Bleek, nigga
Countin' Euros
Rollin' with some killas
Rollin' up some pack
I know that you smell us
When we roll up on ya
Don't look unfamiliar
'Cause we got one choppa
And 'bout 20 pistols
We'll be 10 cars deep
Finna be in yo street
Off like 4 pints
Then I fell asleep
Piano with my choppa
Play a melody
I'm done bein' good
So many felonies
