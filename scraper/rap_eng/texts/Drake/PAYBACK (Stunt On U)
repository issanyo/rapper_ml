[Intro - Drake]
Ugh ...

[Verse - FindTheL]
You're crazy to wanna play this game
You don't wanna play this game with me
I know how to push your buttons
How you want it
Girl it's all the same
When you had me you didn't show me love
Now I made it I'm all up in this club
(Hm)
And I got Drake all on this song
Watch your girlfriends sing along
You did me wrong so ...

[Chorus - Drake]
I'm gonna stunt on you
I'm gonna stunt on you
You let me go
Little did you know
I could of made it
All on my own

[Verse - Drake]
It's ten o'clock on a Wednesday and I know you're home
Driving up and down your street hoping that you come outside
Cause I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted
And I just need you to see me ohh ou ohh
Childish as it seems it will make it all better better
Selfish as it is this just ain't about you no
Did me wrong every time we were together
And that why ...

[Chorus - Drake]
I'm gonna stunt on you
I'm gonna stunt on you
You let me go
Little did you know
I could of made it
All on my own

[Breakdown - FindTheL]
All on my ...
All on my own
All on my ...
All on my own, yeah
Girl I just wanted to stunt ...
Girl I just wanted to stunt on you, on you

[Chorus - Drake]
I'm gonna stunt on you
I'm gonna stunt on you
You let me go
Little did you know
I could of made it
All on my own
DONTHRILLA BITCH!
