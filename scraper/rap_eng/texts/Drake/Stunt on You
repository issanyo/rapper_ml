[Verse]
It's 10 O'clock on a Wednesday and I know your home
Drivin up and down your street
Hopin that you'll come outside
Cause I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted
And I just need you to see me
Childish as it seems, it'll make it all better, better
Selfish as it is, this just ain't about you no
Did me wrong every time we were together, -gether
And that's why
I'm gonna stunt on you
I'm gonna stunt on you
You let me go, little did you know
I could've made it all on my own
