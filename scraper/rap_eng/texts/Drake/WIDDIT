Girl this gon be a Head Board Banger!

[P Rocx]
Girl I know that it's been a minute
I'll take the night off for you
I swear tonight I'm gon spoil
Show you how much I adore you, yeah
You know all you gotta say is that you widdit
And I'm come and pay you a visit
Have you all covered in kisses
Back shots all over the kitchen
We treat the table like a mattress
Fallin all over the cabinets
Girl you know I'm selfish
And can't nobody have this, they can't have this

[Bridge]
I know just what you want, you ain't gotta say it
It ain't hard to guess by your body language
I know you hella anxious bae
Cause you already naked baby

Pullin off another nightshift

Bout time we make it personal
Breakfast-in-the-morn-type vibes
Let me show you what this sex game like
