[Intro]
When I get older
I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom
Just like a waving flag

[Verse 1]
Born from a throne, older than Rome
But violent prone, poor people zone
But it's my home, all I have known
Where I got grown, but now it's gone
Out of the darkness, in came the carnage
Threatening my very survival
Fractured my streets and broke all my dreams
Now feels like defeat to wretched retreat

[Pre-Chorus]
So we struggling, fighting to eat
And we wondering, if we'll be free
We can not wait for some faithful day
It’s too far away so right now I’ll say

[Chorus]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back

[Verse 2]
So many wars, settling scores
All that we've been through and now there is more
I hear them say love is the way
Love is the answer that's what they say
But were not just dreamers of broken down grievers
A hand will reach us and will not forsake us
This can't control us, no it can’t hold us down
We gon' pick it up even though we still

[Pre-Chorus]
Struggling, au nom de la survie
And we wondering, battant pour nos vie
We patiently wait for some other day
That's too far away so right now I say

[Chorus]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back

[Verse 3]
How come when the media stops covering and there’s a little help from the government
We forget about the people still struggling and assume that its really all love again, nah
See we don’t have to wait for things to break apart
If you weren't involved before, it’s never too late to start
You probably think that it’s too far to even have to care
Well take a look at where you live what if it happened there?
You have to know the urge to make a change lies within
And we can be the reason that they see their flag rise again

[Chorus]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back

[Outro]
When I get older, when I get older
I will be stronger, just like a waving flag
