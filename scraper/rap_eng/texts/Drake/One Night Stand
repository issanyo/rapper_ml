[Verse 1] [Drake]
Diamonds hang around my neck the crib is all finish
No love for these bitch, This year is all business
It is a shame that a couple of them are off limits
No offense to my nigga, Its just the industry small
We all lust for the same women
You know the ones we saw before we came in it
I know we ain't trippin
I know I got a couple things that Lil Wayne dip in
That Lil Wayne dip in
I be the same wit it
This shit is all about hits and miss's
The one's that you fucking
And the one's you wife up
Don't let'em fuck your life up
Half a mill to perform
When it's lit up
When it's lit up

Yeah, I met her on facebook
That's right That's right
I met her on facebook
Said it started when I started liking pictures
Making comments
And all over And all over she told me
We threw
Yeah I know
She would act funny too
The next thing I know she came through the crew
Yeah we spread real good
All night on the floor, on the couch, on the table
You know how we do
Then the next thing I know

Cause her man at home
He textin lets go
I told her she made it
Nah Nah I threw
