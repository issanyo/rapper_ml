[Drake]
My name is drizzy
And i ain't perfect
But i work hard
So i deserve it
And i belong
Right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it
I ain't mistah feeny
Nah i got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner
And i fall in love with girls caught up with superficial glamor
Who dress like Sarah Jessica
And live like princess Diana
So often they have addictions
And im the one that'll feed it
But truly you're bad enough that you don't even really need it
You can show up at the party on dirty public transit
And i guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin candids
Of you and your posse partying
Drinking watch you get handed
With your virgin island tans
All lookin like you just landed
I don't really understand it
Im not sure im comprehending it
But these girls are having fun with whoevas money they spendin

Chorus x2
I got to be Unstoppable
I got to be Unstoppable
Ey ey ey ey
You don't lie
Ey ey ey ey
You don't lie

[Wayne]
My name is weezy
I'm almost perfect
And i work harder than hard workin
Bizarre circus
That's where my bar surface
Therefore i act a clown
Even when im laying on my back
Im never backin down
So overstand me
I got a condo in Miami
And my doormat is always sandy
And i run Louisiana

But ive never pulled a hammy
And i got a condo in Atlanta
And i always wear a bandannie
And when it comes down to stuntin
You boys is just buntin and
Im swinging for the fence
Your girl hanging from my dick
Your girl sanging to my shit
Like ah loli loli pop
She say i get that pussy wetter than a dasani shop
She say i get that pussy better
Better than her gynecologist
Hoe just text me
Everybody want some mo dick mo dick
Old bitch
Young bitch
But i be like damnnnn
All i got is one dick

Chorus
I got to be Unstoppable
I got to be Unstoppable
Ey ey ey ey
You don't lie
Ey ey ey ey
You don't lie

[Santogold]
I got the talk
The beats and bass
Give me one I'll take it
Make you lose your place
Tell me I-I-I can play
So I speed up the pace
I break it break it you can't stop me
In this ra-race

Chorus x2
I got to be Unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ey ey ey ey
You don't lie
Ey ey ey ey
You don't lie
