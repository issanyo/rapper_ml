[Hook]

Oh, she say I'm a sweeterman
But she say that she don't need a man
I say why don't we make an agreement then
We can just, while we being friends
Oh
Girl I know you wanna
I know you wanna, yeah

[Verse]

Party at the cribbo
Only wanted you here, not all of you friends though
In the feels so I'm never doing cheap shit
Doing what I can, I'mma show you that I mean shit

This ain't a love ballad, but I'm so dumb founded
Too much green, got too much salad
In the bong, feeling wrong, I just wanna be right though
Like I'm an iPhone fixing all the typos

Walking on a tightrope, will I fall down?
You can go Geico, but I'mma ball out
That 10% is like everything that I meant is like everything I gave is like everything I did

And if I never see a dollar then fuck it
Keeping with the rap like you kept me the comfort
Sometimes things are hot like an oven
But other times like I'm taking face full of knuckles

One, two, punch
I been up too much
I been stuck on you
I been fucked up drunk for a minute

I'm just kinda wondering if I can win it

Slurred words are still there
It's hurts but sure, you know that I still care
So I'mma pound these shots, these dudes pounce on thot
But my sights set, I might get, my one chance and (and, and)
