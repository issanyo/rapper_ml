Ever since a youngin been always dreaming of something
See I grew up out of nothing so u always wanted to be stunting
Constantly looking for a come up we were always hunting
4th down our bread and butter man we never punting
Seeing money that they flaunting like they fronting us
Always right in front of our face man they was taunting us
Just plotting for all the things that we wanting cause reality was daunting our lack of money was haunting us
All these rap tracks talking bout their fat stacks Maybachs at a trap house like who made that
Sure you made a milli moving all that weight fast
Lies that be told by these fake ass
Rappers that be going to the dealership and saying that they'll pay cash
Rookies in the game saying they from way back
Wish I could be laid back but I'm  fucking weighed back
Money on my mind but that ain't always paid back

Yeah that ain't always pay back
Keep that in your mental man play it back
Just Remember one thing man you got that shit that they lack
Can't nobody fucking touch you when you make raps
And I know right now we gon struggle through
Hand on the shovel while watching as the world crumble to
Ash and rubble until we free from our troubles too
I'm a keep on going until I win rep that w
From a young age all I ever wanted was to make the front page
About making my pay
Maybe make mill with all the sounds filling my brain
Yeah we do it real quick but a 100 ain't all the way
We were thinking in the billions making minimum wage
And Tryna reach the ceiling but nothing falling my way and
We see the villains who be coming up everyday
And yeah we fucking listened even asses got shit to say
See money talks louder than any sibling could
That's why I'm saying if you have it then you living good
No disrespect to my brothers but I'm just saying no paying or playing would make me glad as making a killing would
Money can't buy you happiness
But it can get this motherfucker called life to stop attacking us
And that's all I ever wanted
I'm tired of being common and living off cups of Ramen
