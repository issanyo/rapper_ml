[Verse 1:Drake]
I might be too strung out on compliments, overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ohh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that
No don't do it, please don't do it, cause one of us goes in
And we all go through it
Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gon' pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

[Hook: Drake]
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know, they know

[Verse 2: Einstein]
Bottles of whiskey, shout out to Fifty
And Jaekwon 'cuz after nine shots I'm feeling tipsy
I put on for my city, on for my city
So many meetings that my schedule is hella busy
Ah, I swear these women steady feeling it
Supermodels asking what the dealy is
I really is a superhero, Lois Lane, older women know my name
But 40 got me feeling so ashamed cuz I be dicking 'em, all
I swear these break lights are broke or something
That's why I know your older cousin
So when you're old and fussing
Ain't no reason I can't say I seen it coming
'Cuz when you're buzzing hating all of a sudden becomes a custom
Ah, I keep a couple bad women with me
The kind that don't mind splitting three O's like Griffey
Oh, I swear I'm feeling so spiritual
It's Einstein and I ain't even spit original
But they know

[Hook: Drake]

[Outro: Drake]
I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind
Tell 'em I apologized, happened over time, they know
