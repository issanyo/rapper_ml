Baby, I like your style

Lips on your neck
We're never too close now
Nothing like you and me
I don’t know your name
But I'm sure that you know me
Fell in love with the music
The feeling is mutual
Loving the way you move on me
Skin so soft, hands on my face to be directed
And you're all that I can see
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money
And when this song comes on, you know

I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time ’fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me

You know, I like that you're wild
So make your way over here right now
We only got a little while
Just thinkin' out loud
Celebrate life with me babe
Don't be in a rush to go now
Oh, girl

I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin’, put a hold on me
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time ’fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me

Hold on me
Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, very long time
One more dance is all I need (Oh yeah, very long time)
One more dance is all I need
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Oh yeah, very long time
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl

Tell me...
I need to know, where do you wanna go?
Cause if you’re down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control
Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where
Oh yeah, very long time
Where, where, where
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl
Where, where, where, where
Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
Cause if you’re down
Back up, back up and

I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
