Now it's a celebration
Oh girl let's celebrate
Yeah it's a celebration
Oh girl let's celebrate

Baby tonight I'm yours
Come on and unwrap your gift
No you can't find it in stores
It's some tailor made for you kind of shit

[Hook]
It's like oooooooh
You don't wanna miss this
Feels like it's Christmas
It's like oooooooh
Yeah it's a holiday but I'm open for business

[Hook]
Got a bottle of that Rose
Baby we gon' celebrate
Make you feel like it's your birthday
Baby girl let's celebrate
Private after-party
I can't wait to celebrate
All up on your body
Baby girl let's celebrate
It's like the fourth of July
In between your thighs
It's like fireworks
Just light up the sky
Don't need no reservation
You're my invitation
To this love making
This a celebration

Baby let's close the door
I'm 'bout to teach you this sex education
Since you passed every course
Hats off to your graduation

How'd I do? How'd I do?
Baby tell me how you feel
They say real girls ain't never perfect
Perfect girls ain't real
I'd agree but I guess we'll just wait and see
Cause I swear you act like perfect is the only way to be
N-N-Nothing matters 'cept for you
Don't let no one out here blind you
Don't remember why you love me
Please allow me to remind you
And I know you left me once
But I came right back to find you
Even though I like being in your past
You got a bright future behind you
Oh, damn, oh
Girl I must admit I look amazing next to you
Girl you crazy, sexy, cool
And you stayed obsessed with school
But that's good
Cause you know that them grades impress me too
And my free days are just for you
But I don't get many
It's like every time we spend time
It feels like the first time
Cause we never spend enough time
You catch me at the worst time
It ain't like you're not worth time
Just I don't control it
But tonight I made it happen, just to celebrate the moment
Give it up one time

[Tank]
Ohhhhhhh
I just wanna celebrate the night with you
I bought some party favors, I'm a light it up if that's alright with you
How you feeling now?
Tryna lay it down
We could count it down
Five, four, three, two, one

[Hook]

[Drake]
Give it up one time
One time
Ce-Ce-Celebrate the moment
Give it up one time
