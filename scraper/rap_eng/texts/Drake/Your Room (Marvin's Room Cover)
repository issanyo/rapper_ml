Said it’s been a long time
Since you been up in my bed
But that doesn’t mean that I
Haven’t been over to yours and
Been all up inside yours instead
And little does she know
It’s the place where we go hard
‘Cos you know my ish is good
Keep you harder than a wood
For the block I gotta keep it hood
I promise I would never leave your side
Just as long as you never leave mine
Turn off your phone and get behind
She ain’t back till half past nine
So we gotta a lot of time…

In your room, your bed, yes
In your room, your bed, yes
In your room, your bed, yes
Little does she know that I’m
All up yours Drake

Funny, funny, funny though
There’s something you need to know
I’m the kinda girl that thinks
Revenge can taste so sweet
Take off the wrapper boy and watch you eat

‘Cos she was f****** with you
When I was f****** with you too
So I guess that’s why I’m back here
Don’t want you like last year
Her face oh when she sees me here

What makes you think that
I want you back now?
I’m just taking what
I had once right now
(x2)

Oh, and I forgot to tell you this yeah
Behind my back I heard you diss me yeah
You said that you were never with me
Girl just fronting wish she could be
So wait till I f*** things up
Thinking I’m here ‘cos I’m needy; FALSE
I want my cake because I’m greedy; TRUE
I can't wait until she finds out
My picture up in your house
My cake and imma eat it too

In your room, your bed, yes
In your room, your bed, yes
In your room, your bed, yes
Little does she know that I’m
All up yours Drake
(x2)

I’m just saying, I’m just saying
(I’m just saying), (I’m just saying)
We can do, we can do
We can do it
(x2)

Oh you make me say
(yeeeaaahhh)
Yeah you make me say
(yeeeaaahhh)
(x8)
