Lyrics to check it out

Verse one Drake

Its been a long long day
A long long day
Say you gotta go
I know you wanna stay
Come on I know you wanna play
We can light it up
Switch it up
Or burn it up
Watcha say
Come through we can open some bottles
Play spin the bottle
We can play a game
You name it
Its on anyway
Don't be shy
I know that's not your style
Lets go that extra mile
Girl check it out

Chorus Drake

You know it, oh you know it
You know, you know it
You gotta check it out
Check it out
Ckeck it out  chorus x2

Verse 2 Drake

Its been a long long day
A long long day
You back in town
Dam you look better now
Loosen my collar
Top dollar
Got the money, the cars, the clothes
Missing the extra
I regret that day
Wish I never stayed away
I never guessed how much I would pay
And yeah I payed
Life goes on
But im holding on
Stuck in the past
Dunno whats going on
I guess its my loss
But at the end Im the boss

Chorus drake

You know it, oh you know it
You know, oh you know it
You gotta check it out
Check it out
Check it out
