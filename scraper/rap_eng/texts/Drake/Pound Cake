[Intro]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money
Dolla dolla bill y'all

[Swaggz]
I stack for the future you thinkin’ temporary
I talk about jewels you thinkin’ February
Send who you want and nigga you know I’m ready
Niggas hatin’ they can’t stand the fact I’m getting fetty
Niggas waiting for me to fall and i know this plenty
So i sit back and i relax and i just sip this Henny
And stack my cheese and watch these rats cause they stomachs is empty
Young niggas gettin’ slain all over some skrill
Goes to show you’ll do anything for a dollar bill
Dig a grave get a gun
And a plot to kill
Shit i donno what to say
It costs to be the boss but it pays to weigh
That’s not really you that’s just who you portray
I want money
You want the fame and radio play
Hoppin' out that thing and they makin that radio face
Fat nigga kick back lots of food on my plate
I traded in the pork and beans for a piece of the steak
I ain't tryna look back ain't no foot on the brakes
I think my phone’s wire tapped listen in for the jakes
Fat nigga I’m raising the heat
So the sun is ma son my thinking is deep
You reap what you sow and you sow what you reek
I remember growing up I had holes in my sneaks
Mama sent me two socks it was cold on my feet
Pops barely knew him only see him in pictures
Mom’s a pastor I grew up knowin the scripture
With a ripped shirt on the strip til the nigga got strip searched
The world is mine
I think my name should be Atlas
Makin hits like I leave on the clay for the crouches
My traps pumping your traps as dry as a cactus
I wanna cheat on my girl with a actress
Im tired of hidin that dope under my mattress
Kill it i did it for practice

[KUSH]
I say fuck chasing bitches imma chase my dream
Cash rules everything im loving my CREAM
Money is the object should i get it any means
Got a circle full of soldiers man
Im loving my team
It was all a dream
None like biggy tho
Smoked out my mind but im steady blowin fifties tho
Always on point like I’m standing on my tippy toes
Loyalty is a must but some niggas never get it tho
And that’s the rule that imma live by
Watching for the snakes some niggas be tryna get by
Party hard and you roll blunts and tryna get high
They copy all your swag and fit it in to make em look fly
I really wanna know why
The question still remains
Did I ever spend the money that I managed to have saved
All these bitches wanna fuck me they see money in my veins
And this pressure on my shoulder got me feelin goin insane
But I’m good
I be out grindin while you niggas sleep
I remember days when I was grindin and I ain't never sleep
Posted on the block while I be up and down the fuckin streets
Gotta lot of issues now I'm tearin on the fuckin beat
Lamborghini sit back feelin merciealgo
Table full of models and bottles surround the cop doe
Shawty dancing im throwing hundreds she screaming tato
It's a party a celebration wherever i go
My niggas riding with me
Drunk or tipsy
Bad bitch beside me she's just rolling up a spliffy
Hop up in the whip, hit the clutch, doin sixty
Black interior, black body, Im moving swiftly
