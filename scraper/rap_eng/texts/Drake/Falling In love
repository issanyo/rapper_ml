{Hook:Drake}
Would've came back for you
I just needed time
To do what I had to do
Caught in the life
I can't let it go
Whether that's right
I won't never know
Hope you forgive me
Never meant wrong
Tried to be patient
& waited to long
But I would've came back
But I would've came back for you
Would've came back
Would've came back


{Randel Alexander: Verse 1}

Could it Be I'm falling in love
With these inconsiderate women & passionate hugs
I put my heart on a box with a bow on the front
But to you it seemed what I was doing wasn't enough
But honestly you was the one that i desired to be
With, even if the time I spent wasn't quality
But now it's like i'm just a lost page in your diary
Wonder if you look in the future & plan on finding me ?
Damn, how long can we let this thing go
If we was married baby would you let this ring go ?
Cause I was thinking maybe we should let this thing grow
& do the things that we never had the green for
Cause i'm far from broke but far from rich
All this time & money but you ain't here to spend it with
Damn, I hear you yelling every time I reminisce
Cause you would start a argument & i'll end it with a kiss
But, shit I just hope that you can understand
Leaving you was never part of the plan
Baby, but if you let a nigga deal the hand
Would you put aside your burdens & take the chance
Yea, wish I devoted all of my time to you
But i was focused on my grind tryna shine for you
So you can grind to & get whatever shoe
& oh, you want a bag ? go & grab two
You can't buy love but if I had to
I would give you the world just to have you
Damn, you really had a nigga going
Ripped me apart & ain't no way to try & sew it
Tell me that you cared but you never really showed it
I gave you my life & i was wide & open
Said I GAVE YOU MY LIFE & I WAS WIDE & OPEN
BUT HE GAVE YOU DICK & YOU DECIDED TO BLOW IT ! agh !
