[Verse 1:]
Girl you’re so kind, I think you’re the best
You’re an angel not a devil when you’re in that blue dress
With the girls I find they always seem to fail my tests
Or rather I fail her tests cause I can’t do long-term like the rest
I’m a player I confess, it barely takes two secs
To get her to leave her ex within three hours we're near sex
With my hands I caress, her chest, her soft nice flesh
But at my age I can’t rest, only tension is a stress
Pretty girl in your bedroom, chilling out with no makeup on
That’s when you're the prettiest, girl please don’t take that wrong
But you will only trip if I went and brought R-Patz along
Kristen Stewart was holy fit, then those photos got snapped upon
I know I preyed upon those older girls, those out of this world
Now I’m going back down to Earth, fuck all the shit that’s stirred
I’m truly a find, I’m your fantasy in disguise
They say love is blind, girl you’d better close your eyes

[Hook: Drake]
Call me crazy shit at least you're calling
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get right

[Verse 2:]
Last Valentine’s Day I met a girl named Renee
We were in love by May, then she found out about April
So she chose to March, damn another broken heart
Don’t blame her, she can’t take a part, it’s my fault I say
Girl now you know all of my past relationships okay
Don’t act with me, you left that old cast on the ship today
Let’s take a holiday, to Las Vegas or LA
Or somewhere just to sit and watch boats by the bay
When you’re young your looks are such a blessing
But a curse, because a boy can’t look at you for five seconds
You’ll just feel insecure, I’m so sure
But that fear can be cured, cause girl I’m the cure
That's my lure, the man who don't do killing
Except lyrically, but personally is just into romantic feelings
Baby tell me your inner thoughts and your deepest emotions
The next thing you see is an ecstasy explosion

[Hook: Drake]
Call me crazy shit at least you're calling
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get right
