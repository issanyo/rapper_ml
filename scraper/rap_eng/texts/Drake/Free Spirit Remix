[Verse 1: Rolla Costa]
I'm about to do it, I'm a fucking do it
Southside banging it so I chop and screw it
Futon flow watch this shit unfold, Rap so i'll like a common cold
I don't give a fuck where you where told, I'm getting that money acupula gold
I'm smoking that kush so sweets in the air, She looking back at me when I'm pulling her hair
I'm a ball, Never fall, your girl is on the call, Begging me to scoup her up
So I can pin her on the wall
We ridding in the coop 2 seat bucket, Hit it when I'm smoking and driving fuck it
That's how I'm a do it with your ass on the steering wheel
Smoke another blunt pop another happy feeling pill
Snatching off braws, you can feel the crush
When it flows, threw your nose, you can feel the rush
I'm a always be winning like a royal flush, Yah lame ass dudes can't rhyme so hush

[Hook: Drake]
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin name on you when I go, you'll still be mine
You'll still be mine, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin name on you, let em know you love the boy, what's up

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune
I play with her mind, she masturbate in my Porsche
Simple love, simple math
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle in her ass
Puffing purple hash, welcome to my power circle
Sucker free no snitching and we know when cowards working
Rolls Royce rolling, rose-gold Rollies
MBA accountants, amounts, they get unholy
My mama still praying for her Rubberband Man
When them wheels land, Travis Barker drums playing
Tap dance to my drum roll
I love a bitch that know how to keep me one rolled

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for one more
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you, there's no side-effects, I'm sure
Went from driving up with some old shit to drivers opening doors
This my town if you need something, just ask for it, it's yours
Yeah, ask for it, it's yours, if you ask for it, it's done
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come
You'll meet everybody I know, first it might seem like a lot
But they all playing they role, put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man, I can't say it enough
I done heard things about y'all, that they can't say about us
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my set
I just give everybody a piece of this and make due with what's left
Yeah I do this shit to the death, yeah I do this shit til I'm gone
I told you it's our world, you foolish thinking I'm wrong
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let these niggas know it's real, what's up

[Hook]
