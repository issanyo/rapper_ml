I know its summer time im macking for a reason
Cuff type flow you know im cuffing for a season
So when the summer up

Bagging bitches up I like to keep a few
Chillin with my team mobbing with the crew
Wasted out our brain chaos like a zoo
So what you gonna do ?
Yeah we know we killing it
The joints over there we can tell that they feeling it
Bottles of proton be careful cause your slipping it
Money in my hand on the road of riches
Be careful who you hang out with
Some niggas are snitches
And when you get in trouble fake niggas might ditch it
I put in work cooking in the kitchen
And my team by my side so they might fish in
Yeah I do it big and you do it small
Bitches on my dick I treat them like they dogs
Sour by the hour you can say I do it "daily"
Looking for a body stacked up halle berry
With that model walk
Let the bottles talk
Now we feeling good and we dont know how to walk

Yeah we got the poping the champagne it on
So I get her to the bed yeah you know its on
