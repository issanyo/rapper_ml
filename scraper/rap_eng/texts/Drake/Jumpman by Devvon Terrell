[Verse]
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to something
My team play like the Bulls like it was '97
Okay, you say you goin' harder, oh my God, you lyin'
I am a pope and you're a pastor oh so please be silent, woo
Why so many people wanna get into my way
Knew all of my enemies but friends is who betray
I feel like a young nigga really on his way
I should open up more, okay, you got it
Caught in your feelings, you wildin'
Subbin' out the niggas trigger fingers
Turn to twitter fingers and you got it
Oh I know they don't know better
You remind me of Kim K you keep on changin' faces, woo
I can't recognize you like your name was Caitlyn, woo
We are not the same, oh man, I hate to say it, woo
Who I am on Gram is who I am in person, real
