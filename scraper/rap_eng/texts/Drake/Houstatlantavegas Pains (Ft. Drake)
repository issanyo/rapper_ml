[Intro]

[Verse 1: La Roux]
My heart it melts like plastic
I fell through the hole yesterday
Your smile pulled me in like elastic
I felt my mind detonate

[Hook: La Roux]
Oh, I've made mistakes
And you just say it's growing pains
When I feel ashamed
You tell me it's just growing pains

[Verse 2: La Roux]
We broke in two like a matchstick
It burns in my soul every day, every day
Your world was to me, so fantastic
And help seemed so far away, far away

[Hook]

[Bridge: La Roux]
When I'm crying out for change
You tell me it's just growing pains
Oh, I've made mistakes
And yes I know, it's growing pains

[Verse 3: La Roux]
The truth it feels like concrete
I drove into this wall yesterday
I wish I could be realistic
But my children, my dreams, went away

[Bridge: Drake]
Houstatlantavegas (ay), Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay), Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ay), Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay), Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch her go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh
