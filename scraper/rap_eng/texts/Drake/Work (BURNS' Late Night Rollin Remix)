Nuh time to have you lurking
Him ah go act like he nuh like it
You know I dealt with you the nicest
Nuh body touch me you nuh righteous
Nuh badda, text me in a crisis
I believed all of your dreams, adoration
You took my heart and my keys and my patience
You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation

[Breakdown: Rihanna & Drake]
Work, work, work, work, work, work

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, okay
You need to get done, done, done, done at work, come over
We just need to slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got [niggas] tryna end me, oh
I spilled all my emotions tonight, Iâ€™m sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?

[Breakdown: Rihanna & Drake]
Work, work, work, work, work, work
He said me haffi
Work, work, work, work, work, work!
Work, work, work, work, work, work!
How many more shots until you're rollin'?

[Drop: BURNS]

[Chorus: Rihanna]
But I wake up and act like nothing's wrong
Just get ready fi...
Work, work, work, work, work, work
He said me haffi
Work, work, work, work, work, work!
He see me do mi
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt!
So me put in
Work, work, work, work, work, work
When you ah guh
Learn, learn, learn, learn, learn
Meh nuh cyar if him
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurting
Beg you something please
