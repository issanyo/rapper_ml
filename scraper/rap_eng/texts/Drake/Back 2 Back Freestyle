[Intro]
Damn dawg like I ain't have nothing to do with this shit Meek
But you gon' go on stage out in Camden and say fuck me
Aye Meek, if it's fuck me then it's fuck you nigga
Let's play

[Verse 1]
I caught a body fore I wrote a rap
You'd rather hold a mic I'd rather hold a mac
I just left jail guess I'm going back
I'll blow a hole in your stomach make 'em sew it back
I ain't got a Wraith I ain't got a ghost
I just got a plate with a lot of coke
I got a lot of tape and a lot of rope
They tried to rob Cass and I shot them both
Why you diss me, need to diss Drake
That nigga killed you first 48
Oh I guess you tough cause you not here
You lying to the world like you not scared
You rapping about a life that is not yours
Went to jail for a gun that was not yours
You was a bum before for a rap money
You still owe me ball pack money
You only come to Philly for a second
I know you paid them niggas for protection
I know they tell you they'll rob for you
But look 'em in the eye will they die for you
I wonder who gon' help when the mac pour
I heard Nicki fucked you with a strap on
I know I got to shoot with a mask on
Nigga you a pussy put a pad on
This shit gon' be easy
I know your folks told on Teepee
I know you got to pay Teefy
I heard that you gotta pay weekly
And tell your lil' nigga better pipe down
I got my shooters looking for him right now
I got a hundred shooters with me right now
Fuck rap we can do this shit right now
I tried to keep the peace tried to keep peace
I even had to argue with my brother 'Lik
He said please AR-AB let me kill 'em all
I said damn nigga shit wasn't deep
I don't understand what the hate be
Drake ate you now you hate me
I just took my gun off safety
You better pay them niggas extra for safety
This shit fucked up cause I liked you
I knew you was a pussy but I hyped you
I lied to the world like you real
Everything come to the light so the truth will
Everybody know that you rich
All the real niggas know you a bitch
If I shoot you right now you'll snitch
I just put a hundred rounds in my clip

[Outro]
Damn dawg on some real shit
This wasn't about me and you man
That boy said my name I don't even know him
I had nothing to do with it man
But you said fuck me well then it's fuck you nigga
If it's fuck me then its fuck you man
Let's play ball
