(Verse 1)
Look, I’m about to go ham in this mother fucka
Bitches know that I’m the man around this mother fucka
Ain't a thang change, accept the money and the fame
Type of nigga make that’ll make a dyke bitch switch teams
Got that money make em call me Richie Rich
Like untied shoes, fuck boy you a trip, 0-100 little nigga real quick
I’m the man of the city (look at the flick of the wrist)
I’m that nigga, light skin too pretty
Goddamn, hundred grand, little bitch I gets busy
Pockets fat, all that, nigga counting that Dinero
Where you at nigga, bank account on zero
Von Tae’ that nigga, muh fucka too trill
Pockets so full like it just ate a meal
Man of the year, I’m the man of the city
Tell these other mother fuckas Don’t forget it, lil nigga


(Chorus)
Now she want a photo
You already know though
You only live once ‒ that’s the motto nigga YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin’ on the bench, nigga we don’t really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can’t see 'em cause the money in the way
Real nigga what's up?
