[Intro]
Lets go
Well alright, well alright
Look
Uh

[Verse]
Feeling sorry for the runner up
I’m still awake, getting money while the sun is up
And they keep saying how they need me to deliver
Cause they hate it when the rookie star doesn’t put the numbers up
Man, hate is so passé, catch me in a Tom Ford suit on draft day
Nigga and it’s just me and my money
Ya don’t even get to play when ya’ll leading by 20
Yeah I infiltrated the game
I was hesitant at first and fear what it would change
Now I’m high off the success and faded off of the fame
And still managed to keep all of my opinions the same
I am so far gone bitch I'm outta here
Hotter than standing inside rocking outerwear
I want it all man, I never learned how to share
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires
Wow, I swear I'm killing shit I'm killing shit
Shout out to the niggas I just made a couple million with
Yeah from the beginning to the end
Know I’m into making history not into making friends
Muthafuckaaaa…
