[Drake - Verse 1]
Hey there, pretty girl
You know, exactly what you got
And I don't, blame you at all
You can't resist it
Especially when the lights so bright
And the money so right
And it's comin in every single night
She don't wanna leave
She just stuck in

[Hook]
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch her go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh

[Drake - Verse 2]
She doesn't ever worry
If she wants it, she'll get it on her own
She knows, there's more to life
And she's scared, of ending up alone
Throw your hands up in the air
Throw your hands up in the air for her
Throw your hands up in the air
Cause the claps you give will get her out of

Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch her go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh

[Drake - Verse 3]
We all got dreams and we all star reachin'
All start peakin, all-star weekend
One hotel room, and all y'all sleepin'
Housekeeping knock to see if all y'all decent
Young girls envy the life y'all heedin'
Never satisfied wit a nice calm evenin'
You be at the games lookin right, all season
But you always with me, on the night y'all leavin'
Ass low, ass low, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and re-dress you
I give you some room and the next morning you'll forget who
Or why, or how, or when
Tonight is probably about to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
Uh... because I never had you
Although I would be glad to
I'd probably go and tattoo
Your name on my heart
I swear, I start, to think, that I'm going crazy

Throw your hands up in the air
Throw your hands up in the air for her
Throw your hands up in the air
Cause the claps you give will get her out of

Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch her go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh
