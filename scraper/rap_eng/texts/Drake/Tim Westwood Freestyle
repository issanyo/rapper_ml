And I roll up looking harder than a....bitch!
Damn a nigga never switch
You should get your cherry bust
Before you fuck around with this!
I buy some Rolexes and pass 'em out as gifts
And when they tell me that's too much
I'm like "No, fuck it, I insist!"
And then we light it up and reminisce
About the things that we would fix
How the fuck we got this rich?
This is just some inspiration
For young niggas on they shit!
This for my young niggas on they shit for real
This also for the hood stars that I created
Whose booking rate went up right after we dated
Girl you made it for real
Hosting parties with athletes or another rapper
Then they trying to fuck you after
Remember when you was my....bitch!?
My special friend with benefits
You remember how you got here?
Hope to God you ain't forget
But the look you're giving me tells me you did
Empty stares across the club
Like y'all don't recognize the kid
But damn, you know what it is
Cameras flashing over here, I know that's something
That you miss, yeah
It been bad, and it gets good
