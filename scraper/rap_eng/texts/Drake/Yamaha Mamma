[Verse 1: Drake]
Listen, girl
You so bad and you single, what's this I hear?
We ain't met yet, my name Drake
And I'ma take the world over, this my year
This I swear
Had my share of women that I been with
I'm young, can ya blame me?
I know you feel like a lot of things off-limits
At least let me describe what it can be
Be faithful, I'll do that
Nah, really, baby girl, I'll do that
'Cause everybody break up when they cake up
We can be the couple that'll never go through that
Yeah and if we ever fallin' off
I swear I'll remind you that
That we're not who they are
Now all I really gotta do is find you
Where you at?

[Hook: Chris Brown & Drake]
From the east to the west
Scream for me if you my number one lady
Take a lead from the rest
You can go fast speed it up for me, baby
I'm a G, what's next
One night with me would drive you crazy
One night with me would drive you crazy
When it starts, are you ready?
Take your marks and get steady
You know that it's about to get heavy
But she's a rider, a rider, my yamaha mama
Ay, ay, she my
My yamaha mama
Ay, ay, be my
My yamaha mama
Ay, ay, she my
My yamaha mama
Ay, ay, be my

[Verse 2: Drake]
Tell me how to locate you
I know satellites all break through
But they don't ever lead me straight to
And I gotta arrive 'fore somebody take you
Know there's someone you don't mean a lot to
And he would hate to know that I got you
I even got a speech in my head
That I write and recite at the moment I spot you
"Hey there, your name is?
I like that, it's suits ya
I'm young, but different
I'm not what you're used to at all"
If we stop at the same red light
I'ma celebrate the fact that I found you, girl
And I'ma ride for you too, as soon as it turn green
Wanna hear from my ladies all around the world
Where you at?
