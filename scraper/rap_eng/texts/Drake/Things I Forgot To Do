[Verse 1: Drake]
I've been out walking
I don't do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
These days

[Verse 2: Babeo Baggins]
I stopped my rambling
Never been once a gambler, my town
But for you, for you, for you, just once
It might be fine these days
These days

[Verse 3: Drake]
I've met some women
I wish I had resisted these days
These days
These days I seem to think about how I have failed to change all of my ways, ohh
These days

[Verse 4: Both]
Yeah, I had a lover
Don't think I'd risk another these days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
Just listen to the life I've made in songs
These days

[Verse 5: Babeo Baggins & Drake]
I've had lovers
I've had lovers, one after another
But this time, me, myself and I are just fine
These days
These days

[Verse 6: Drake]
I've stopped the dreaming
I don't do too much scheming these days
These days
I sit inside a chauffeur car
With windows down and count the stars these days
These days
