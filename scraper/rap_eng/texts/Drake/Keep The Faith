[Verse 1: dvsn]
How far we go
Always seems to get better with time
Won't you, outsmart me
Told me that your brain works better than mine
Tell me I should know you
I'll get to know you again
You want me to show you
I'm gonna show you again
Now we're in the zone
Gon' let me all in again
And now you're coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Now you're coming over
Over and over again
Over and over again
You tell me I should know you
But I'll get to know you again
And you want me to show you
I'm gonna show you again
When we're in the zone you
Gon' let me own it again
And now you're coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Now you're coming over
You're coming over

[Verse 2: dvsn]
I wet all the floors of your ego, damn
Feel I was slipping away
And you know that I ain't gonna go
Ain't gonna go nowhere, nowhere
I guess some of these things never change, no, no
There's a lot going on and you know that it's true
There's a lot on my mind and you bother the times when I'm not here with you
But keep it way more than 100, keep it 110
Show me what I gotta do

[Chorus: Drake & dvsn]
And I know that you been working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful

[Bridge: dvsn]
And before you leave here (I need you to cum)
And until you do baby (don't you leave)
It ain't about me no more (need you to know)
Tonight I'll make sure you (cum befor me)
And before you leave here (I need you to cum)
But before you do (don't you leave)
It ain't about me no more (need you to know)
Make sure that you (cum before me)


[Verse 3: dvsn]
Have to get you on top of me
And we 'gon do this thing properly
Make you throw your hands in the air, throw your hair back
Like a winning ticket off the lottery
But you don't wanna, no, you don't want to start with me
No, you don't want to start with me
But you shouldn't keep shaking that in front of me
Unless you're down to do this publicly
Girl you know you, know you gotta get comfortable
All the dogs here, run with me
And I fuck with you
So if you really fuck with me
Get as freaky as you wanna be, girl it's up to you
And she hit me with that "I don't do this normally, but for you I'll make exceptions"
Well, let's see what's next then

[Outro: dvsn]
I'm gonna make sure, make sure (I need you to cum)
Gonna make sure, make sure (don't you leave)
You know that I'm gon' make sure (need you to know)
Gonna make sure, make sure (cum before me)
Gonna make sure, make sure (I need you to cum)
Gonna make sure, make sure (don't you leave)
You know I gotta make sure, gotta make sure (need you to know)
Gonna make sure, make sure (cum before me)
