Verse 1: Drake

I love these cold nights my breath light and I slide through to your crib
Got my mom's car my phone off cause I don't want to leave here
Girl the moon peakin' the sun leavin' let's watch it disappear
Got the heat on the music low so you all up in my ear
I keep yawnin' and yawnin' like I'm gettin' tired
You keep telling me that I need to head home but I don't gotta work so it's fine
It was just eight but now it's three what happened to the time
It don't even matter we having fun so really girl I don't mind
Got my diamonds all on my neck and all this gal 'o mine on my face
With yo' soft lips and your long hair that go down to your waist
If we fuck now I might pull it I don't care if it's fake
Oh you got to work in the morning girl you might show up late
It's been one hell of a night with you I don't mind it at all
Heard you break hard so I'm prepared to pick up the pieces that fall
