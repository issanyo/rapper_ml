[Intro]
D-D-D-Do that

[Chorus]
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
'Cause we can do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
'Cause we can do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)

[Verse 1]
Uhh, focus on women then you get less done
It's light work, flow is heavy like a wet sponge
I'm gettin' rich 'cause I think being broke is less fun
Celebratin' Father's day every day so don't get sonned
Where you tryna go, I'm ready
Pick any place in the world, the dough is comin' in steady
I'm chillin' out with T and Jay and Nico
My city ain't a city that support they own people
But I run it, you say something about it, I doubt it
I got this Gucci wallet, I do not leave home without it
I'm 'bout it, I'm 'bout it, I'm standing on these couches sayin'
"Bring this booth a bottle, no we do not need a spout bitch!"
Pardon me, that was rude
If you just started balling I say I'm 'bout to conclude
What more is there to do
And why I would pretend
She call me and I hit it every time like 'SEND' (damn)

[Chorus]
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
'Cause we can do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
'Cause we can do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, look
Me and 40 whilin', stylin'
Somehwere on the island
Lay her down and fold her like that shit you put a file in
We all get to pitch in and that's when it gets to pilin'
And I'm callin' your bluff
Don't act like you can't see my dialin'
Never embellish, believe 'em 'cause he ain't exist
The stars on my team but I lead the league in asist
Never been a believer that previously exist
I wonder what I be doin' when previously is this
I do breakfast at the Ivy, you can grab some lunch to go
Havin' dinner at Chateau's, right across from Lindsey Loooo-han
Don't I treat you better than your old man?
He couldn't have done it like this sho' nuff
I tend to dro puff
I'm throwed and I'm high
I guess I'm throwed up
Tone it all down
My nigga grow up
And tell me when you start getting paid to show up, damn

[Chorus]
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
'Cause we can do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
'Cause we can do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)

[Chorus]
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
'Cause we can do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
'Cause we can do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
