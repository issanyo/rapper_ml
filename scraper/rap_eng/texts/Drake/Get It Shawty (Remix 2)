[Verse: Drake]
Digital camera, freeze the moments
Use money and talent as my lead component
Normally Drake sip Don P but
You the type of girl that I need Patron with
We could do it, corporate sponsor
Your man prolly riding in his boy's Elantra
You could drop him, he's forgotten, you got options
And plus I show these young boys how to bring the money on in
When they rhymes ain't hot, and they records don't sell
Stuntin' on the strip, came with no I.D
And I only brought cash, if they checkin' oh well
I'm good, Drake make one phone call and I'm inside
Welcome to the life of an icon
And I don't like jewels, but I am thinkin' of you
In the mirror while I'm puttin' all this ice on
So

[Chorus: Lloyd (Drake)]
All I really want is
For you to back it up, go on and put ya weight on it
Cause it's alright, do what you wanna
Make me believe ya
Ooh I wanna see ya
(Get it shawty) get it shawty, get it shawty
(Yeah man, ATF Street Love)
Get-get-get-get-get
Get it shawty, get it shawty

[Outro: Drake]
Lloyd I see you Danny
Atlanta I see you, and if its ten
Toronto, Do it for Y'all
Yeah man
