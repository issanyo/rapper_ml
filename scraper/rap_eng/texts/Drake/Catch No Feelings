I told you from the jump, me and you just friends
Never did date cause I knew that shit would end
Made you upset when I told you how it is
Now we don't talk, but ever since then
You been worrying about a nigga, and you calling my phone
Looking for info through my songs
Accusing me of shit, girl you know that's wrong
Trust me when I say, that we better off alone
Know you hate it cause you want someone else
You really shouldn't focus on me
You need to worry 'bout someone else
And as you can see, I've been doing my own thing, (own thing)
I'm trying to make this move
You're a diamond under pressure
But you always kept it cool
And I told you play your role
You know you just decide
You say that you want to leave
But don't know how to decide
But I know you want to stay
You ain't going to find nobody realer
You caught feelings like a nigga was a picture

[Hook]
Told you from the jump, don't catch no feelings
I told you, you would get hurt, in the ending
(I said) don't catch no feelings
Don't catch no feelings(6x)

[Matt Reed]
Dammit, dammit darling I gave you warnings
And I needed space like a fucking martian
(More)moreover, super sober
I needed room as if I was Marvin
Slow but surely
Darwin's theory
Hearts revealing an eerie feeling
As time gets even, never place queries on me
You yapped too much about the penny ante
This mechanic is so uncanny
Trying to grind a Grammy up for ya mammy
Implode a plan up then expand it
Things grow, wonderful
Dreams become your growth
Forever under oath
Rollie gold 'til i overdose
Girl, you know you was throwed the most (throwed the most)
Well, Ex X'd Tisk Tisk
Fly to shit around a lit wrist
Nigga that, Bitch this
Oh well, you're dismissed!
Like school-bells & Dipshits
The truth was never distorted
No strings attached, we were cordless
It's important to be smart and gorgeous

[Hook]
Told you from the jump, don't catch no feelings
I told you, you would get hurt, in the ending
(I said) don't catch no feelings
Don't catch no feelings(7x)
Told you from the jump, don't catch no feelings
I told you, you would get hurt, in the ending
Yeah, I told her, I said, don't catch no feelings(3x)
Don't catch no feelings with me girl
