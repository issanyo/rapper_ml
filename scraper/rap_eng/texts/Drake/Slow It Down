Haha
I ain't tryna be cute but

[Verse 1]
I won't expect you to move as fast as me
Cause I am way too experienced in this love game bitches
And I won't expect you to kiss me
Cause it just won't be everything you wanted and more for sure
And I don't do that cause it's just gonna lead to the touchin' lovin'
Ah baby baby
I'm gonna stop the braggin'
Because what we're gonna be having is
A Little bit this, a little that
And a little bit of boom tap, bap bap
Yeah yeah
And I ain't saying that you down
But I'm tryna turn that frown around

[Hook: Drake]
What if we happen to kiss, then we touch?
Put a rush on it
And get over with
What if I just know what you like and it feels right?
Then it's over with
What if I don't call you back, prove you right
And all this last just one night?
Maybe we should slow it down
Slow slow slow

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you like that huh?
Baby it's just you, me
Sittin' on the couch
And baby whatever you do, don't say ouch, ouch
Baby, why are you frontin'?
Baby you know that you love it yeah
And I know that you don't want me to judge you
But baby girl I'm the one that is here is with you
Right now, right now, right now
You got the crown
So fuck what they was talking about
Baby I need you too listen
I'm here to stay not to visit
Baby girl I know it's not a simple task
But you know I'm gonna ask

[Hook: Drake]

[PND talking]
See let me paint a picture for y'all with me
Me and the girl
She innocent
I'm not so innocent
You guys know what it is though but uh
She shy, she real shy
She tryna put it like she, she too good for me
She know she ain't too good for me
Cause there wouldn't be conversation
We wouldn't be talking
She wouldn't have my number
I wouldn't have hers
She wouldn't be calling my number
Know what I mean? So
She at the crib winkin' and shit
And she, she know what she doing to me
I'm playing with it
I want it
I don't know how far she wanna go
But she ain't really finna going anywhere
So, this is just what to show what she can't have
And I'm also trying to understand, know what I mean?
Let me get back to the hook
