Verse 1:
You're ditching school, not in class
Wasting your lazy @$$
Don't even care what will hurt you
But you'll see what this will do
Don't want to work, no need to study
Believe me, this will be heavy
Grades will drop, they'll have the teeth
Of shooting down your expertise
You're now assuming you'll get away with it all, oh yeah
But, the one thing that you'll have to know that should be enough
You know you should face the downside of Seniorit15

Verse 2:
Some of the signs, you have to know
If you slack, you fail the show
Refusing, to complete a problem
One more time, no longer hold 'em, one-sided problem
No longer saved
Cancelled college is riding your wave
Another chance for you
Ain't looking good, no Mountain Dew
You're probably thinking that this is no big deal, oh yeah
However, the closer you get to college, it actually is
(Because) You know you should face the downside of Seniorit15

Facing the Downside of Seniorit15
(x5)

Verse 3:
I know that you're, ready to go
But you're falling, off the boat
Anxious for Prom, making you pumped
But in the end, you'll feel bummed
When you unearth the cost of slacking too soon, oh yeah
The worse you withdraw yourself could pay a lot more
Because you really should face the downside of Seniorit15

Facing the Downside of Seniorit15
(x8)

(END)
