[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Zone, zone
Zone six!

[Hook: Drake]
I got money that I saved then I'm back on road
Get my jewelry out the safe cause I'm back on road
I still do these hoes the same when I'm back on road
If you wasn't there for me when I was all alone
Then bitch don't expect no love when I'm back

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm just an East Atlanta nigga with a body on his belt
I done had a million beefs but I ain't never call for help
I'll take a nigga bricks and I done took a nigga reup
Put that pistol on your partner made him piss all on himself
Got your bitch so pissy drunk
That she done threw up on herself
'Fore I send her back to you
She gon' have Guwop on her breath
I'm the last real nigga left
I'm on an island  by myself
I'm my only competition so I'm battling with myself
Facing prison, drug addiction
It's like I'm battling with myself
I done shook off all my demons
Now I'm back to myself
You didn't keep it real nigga so just keep it to yourself
Waiting on Gucci Mane to call you
Nigga better not hold your breath

[Hook: Drake]
I got money that I saved then I'm back on road
Get my jewelry out the safe cause I'm back on road
I still do these hoes the same when I'm back on road
If you wasn't there for me when I was all alone
Then bitch don't expect no love when I'm back

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
These niggas faking like they happy but they mad I'm home
I'm the 2K16 Al Capone
I slap a nigga with a strap and then I throw him a hundred
He be like "fuck going to trial, man just throw me the money"
Can't eat, can't sleep, man I miss these streets
Muhammad Ali and these streets miss me
I went from trappin' on the block to niggas trappin' for me
I left the trappin' went to rap thought youâ€™d be happy for me
And then your jealousy turned to hate
And you wrote a statement on me
But when they let me out the gates
My bitch was waiting on me
See I ain't mad at you homie, we ain't got no beef
But I ain't got no rat for you, I know you must love cheese

[Hook: Drake]
I got money that I saved then I'm back on road
Get my jewelry out the safe cause I'm back on road
I still do these hoes the same when I'm back on road
If you wasn't there for me when I was all alone
Then bitch don't expect no love when I'm back
