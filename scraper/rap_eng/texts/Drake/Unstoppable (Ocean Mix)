I was like a satellite spinning away
Almost lost forever and leaving no trace
Floating through the darkest reaches of space
To another galaxy

[G-Eazy]
I guess it's about that time
G-Eazy, haha, Dana what up
Yeah

[Lianne]
We are unstoppable

Okay, Income on the incline
Show up fashionably late but always in time
Makin' money plus a name how I bust lines
Tryin' to add more funds like a plus sign
Makin' money doing tours I ain't got a deal
I grind hard, shine hard, man you gotta feel
You sit at home and fuck around you are not for real
I'm on the track with sh*t and they gon' cop a feel

Uh, take notes and pay attention hoe
Every move I ever make is all intentional
Your girlfriend showed me she was intellectual
I smash fast while you only get the X and O
Turn heads when they see me like a red car
Tryna catch me getting tired like kevlar
I'm so over your head like I been bar
Smoke weed everyday I'm a dance star
Swag

Money money on the tilt, I got money on the tilt (x4)
Fresher than anyone, got money on the till
Money money on the tilt, I got money on the tilt (x4)
Fresher than anyone, got money on the tilt

Ok, Bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, f*ck are y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off, set it off, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't've drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known

'Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these n*ggas
All I need's a f*cking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smiddoke, a package of the swishers
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
Y'all know them? Well, f*ck it, me either
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwin' hundreds
When I should be throwin' ones, b*tch, I run it (Ah)
