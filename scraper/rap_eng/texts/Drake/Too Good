[Verse 1: Conor Maynard]
I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days, these days
I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

[Pre-Chorus: Conor Maynard]
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as the expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

[Chorus: Conor Maynard & Sarah Close]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

[Verse 2: Sarah Close]
I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

[Pre-Chorus: Sarah Close]
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as the expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it

[Pre-Chorus: Conor Maynard & Sarah Close]
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another player on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you could have it

[Chorus: Conor Maynard & Sarah Close]
You needed me
Oooh, you needed me
Oooh, you
