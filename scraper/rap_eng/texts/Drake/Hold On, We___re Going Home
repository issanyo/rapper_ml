(originally by Drake)
I got my eyes on you
Everything that I see
I want your high love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion endlessly
Cause you're a good one and you know it
You act so different around me
Oh you're a good one and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
So just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
So just hold on we're going home ohoh
You're a good one and you know it
Gave you everything I love
Think there's something, baby
Think there's something, baby
Cause you're a good one and you know it
You act so different around me
Oh you're a good one and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Oh just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
Hard to do these things alone
So just hold on we're going home
Oh Yeah
I got my eyes on you
Everything that I see
I want your high love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
Left your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion endlessly
Cause you're a good one and you know it
You act so different around me
Oh you're a good one and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on
You just hold on
We're going home
We're going home
