[Verse 1: fritzy ]
You say my life's abnormal then you better watch
Asking me to be normal man you ain't my coach
I ain't standing here for you to get pleasure to watch
Before i forget i also got laundries to wash
Shit, this life ain't worth a price
It's like a game sit down we roll the dice
I'm just grinding to get paper for us
While you're sitting there saying that am so nice
Huh' don't call me a villian
I do this shit everyday before i see the sun
Many people want to get more than a million
Then why you calling me crazy you know you ain't the one
Sorry, am also a bit nervous after this probably i'll hit the showers
And i ain't the kinda girl who really likes flowers
Wait, no that doesn't mean am a coward


[bridge]
Is this a dream or nah?
Can i say it's my life cause you treated me well ma?
I know i was more calm
Now am no harm
Looking upto you and all you say is that


[Chorus]
This ain't no rehearsal ,this ain't no game
I know you gonna say that i was a little pain
Let's ride down the lane
Hopes high we gonna gain
Looking up to you and all you say is that


[verse 2]
Lemme tell you one thing
I don't mind wanna ruling like a king
Yes you can say that am only sixteen
And for sure i can cause am not even mean
Hahaha am on my own space
Before and after that's a very different case
Maybe am never meant to always catch your gaze
Lemme leave you to finish that thing you call maze
Yeah, that's mawkish
Living here makes me feel so boyish
It's my life so you ain't gonna demolish
Almighty High knows that i ain't foolish

[Chorus]


[you been through alot of pain and for sure you can agree i was one of them
And am sorry cause most of them i never meant
Will you please forgive me?]x2

[Chorus:Fritzy]
