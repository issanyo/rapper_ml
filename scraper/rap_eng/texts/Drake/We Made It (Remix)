[Intro: Trae]

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
I'm the man in my city like biggie, so haters they probably can't stand him
Should've been part of the opera the way that I play in the Phantom
This bird on my seat kind of bright for me, fuck it I told them to tan em'
First rapping nigga that powered the streets so the radio banned him
I'm looking for something to surf on the night with a body so vicious
If she not fucking I tell her get lost and I send her the worst of my wishes
I'm helping my niggas get dinner we eating, they talking bout dishes
Fuck with my money I'm pricing your head, blow the rest on these bitches
Nigga we made it
Nigga we made it
Nigga we made it
Nigga we made it
Try to keep that on the low, cause them people find out we gon' probably get raided
Find me a tutor, head game was smart to the point I was searching for knowledge
She just got her masters, something amazing you would think she fresh out of college
Shout out to Drizzy and OVO, and this shit I just got from Tokyo
That alley hoop helped me, I'm finna' score
Gotta let my nuts hang on before we go
I'm patiently waiting, swang is patiently skating
Just incase they ain't hear what I stated, I ain't worried
My niggas we made it

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it
Nigga we made it, aye
Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it, aye
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it

[Verse 2: Drake]
She said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office
The head was so good it makes sense why you work at the head office
In 2007 I sat in the lobby of Motown and waited
Now I walk into the buildin' and go off like "Nigga we made it!"
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin'
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!
You fly out your lady, I fly out my latest
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous
I'm a just hand her a business card and say, "Nigga we made it!"
And she gotta come through the hotel and pop it off for me
Then she gon' text her best friend like "Girl he got some good dick and money"
Her friend hit her back like "I know that already, that nigga's amazin'"
Then I send a message to both of they asses like "Nigga we made it!"
