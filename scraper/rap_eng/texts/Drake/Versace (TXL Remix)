[Intro: Drake & Quavo]
Yeah
Oh shit man, who that is?
Shout out Migos, shout out Zaytoven one time
That Migos, Drake on Versace?
(Hip Hop TXL, The Xclusive List!)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati
This is a gated community, please get the fuck off the property
Rap must be changing ‘cause I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me
Niggas be wanting a verse for a verse, but man that's not a swap to me
Drowning in compliments, pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis
I think I'm selling a million first week, man I guess I'm a optimist
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talking 'bout? Saw this shit coming like I had binoculars
Boy, Versace, Versace, we stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows' Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy
I've been so quiet, I got the world like, "What the fuck is he plannin'?"
Just make sure that you got a backup plan ‘cause that shit might come in handy
Started a label, the album is coming, September, just wait on it
This year I'm eating your food and my table got so many plates on it
Hundred inch TV at my house, I sit back like, "Damn, I look great on it"
I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga, don't ask for my take on it
Speaking in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano
Fuck all your feelings ‘cause business is business, it's strictly financial
I'm always the first one to get it, man that's how you lead by example
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Word to New York, ‘cause the Dyckman and Heights girls are calling me "Papi"
I'm all on the low, take a famous girl out where there's no paparazzi
I'm tryna give Halle Berry a baby and no one can stop me

[Hook: Quavo]
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Versace, Versace, I brought that shit back, all these niggas they copy
Medusa head on me, I'm at the hotel, Versace Palazzo
I rented the yacht for a week, but I bought the convertible Lambo
Six mill for the mansion, I see haters coming, I need some more ammo
These niggas gay, that's Elmo, so much green I turned camo
Some Hoover niggas on flannels, light, light you up, no candle
Grip on that handle, Yosemite Sam ya, that bitch bang like a banjo
Told my arms dealer no need for a box, I don't read the instructions, I throw out the manual (Woo!)
Versace, Versace, my brother King Trell, he in a Ferrari
I don't look the same, my camera the same, I made too much money (Woo!)
Paul Pierce is my neighbor, I told him he shoulda went to the Clippers
I got some crazy ideas for Versace, get them and tell 'em my number
Versace, auggh Picasso, Basquiat, I'm cocky
23, fifteen mill, I'm just getting started
Pop water my water, I walk around on my wallet
I don't fuck with Saddam but, that's gold all in my toilet
Statues of Horus, Anubis is polished
I don't gotta rap about, coke for you to enjoy it
I'm 'bout to join the money team, just holla to Floyd about it
Versace, Versace, I'm taking my money to the Cayman Islands (Woo!) Versace

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Versace, Versace, it's killers, real niggas that's all in my posse (Shooters!)
I'm getting so rich that they making up rumors that I'm 'Luminati (Rich!)
Just me and my niggas, we killing these bitches, go body for body (Murder!)
These suckers be hating, they praying to God I don't cop a Bugatti
Hold up, drop the top on the 'Rari
Pull in the club and I'm stopping the party
Hold up, got bitches on bitches, they popping on Mollys
I'm probably at Follies with PeeWee and Tip, questing with Lou
I did everything that I said I would do
I really won't tell you I'm better than you
But we are not on the same level as you
‘Cause the G55 got a hell of a view
Regular niggas make regular moves
With ya regular bitch and ya regular crew
And you nigga still smoking on regular too, like "Word!?"
What a shame, my nigga
Louboutin blood like Game, my nigga
Get left tryna aim, my nigga
Like Saddam Hussein, my nigga
I'm whipping this brand new machine, hundred bands in my jeans
Call yo bitch Barry Sanders, she done ran through the team
I got hoes out the D, they playing on the team
Do anything for me, I mix that Xan' with the lean
Hold up, let me get it back
Versace, Versace, I'm getting this money, I'm stacking my broccoli (Racks!)
I'm running my city, you might gotta pay me you land on my property (Tax!)
I bought the boardwalk and I parked on the ave, shit my life like Monopoly
You caught a new case and you got outta jail but you look like a cop to me
Get out of jail free card?
