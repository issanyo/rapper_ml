[Hook]
0 to 100 playa real quick (Real Quick)
Skip 1 to 99, dime by dime real shit (Real fuckin Quick homie)
0 to 100 playa real quick (Real Quick)
Skip 1 to 99, dime by dime (Real fuckin Quick homie)

[Judicious]
That's the real shit, this ain't a fuckin race
But you can bet your dough on the run, it's a paper chase
I'll scrape and strafe every tree or wood, a waste of space
There ain't gon be a trace of vapor, great landscapers ace
My fuckin nuts are bigger than the squirrels taking grapes
Making apes bananas enough to go whine and rape a steak
Or maybe fucking pussy, make the gape that ain't at stake
For Heaven's sake, and Jesus Christ Judicious fuckin faint

Faint mother fuckin bitch
Why?
And watch your mouth man, jeez
Sorry

For Heaven's sake, and Jesus Christ Judicious fucking faint
You won't see me fucking faint, must be huffing paint
Stuffing taints, cunt punt a pussy's pussy, puffin dank
Cuffing skanks to the fence cuz the cuff yo chick thing made me poke
The joking clown holding frowns in, found him upped to roughing pranks
I thought I timed my rhymes from time to timing
The rhyming, dining in alive I'm driving
Surviving, I'm striving and thriving arriving
At the hide, the hive we on Vivran jiving
I go 0 to 100 brotha real quick
I'm not a hero or gunner but I still spit
Getting dinero you a runner but I'm real quick
Always from 0 to 100 and it's real fuckin quick homie
Slick homie it kills when your pockets are thick homie
It ain't shit if you spit like this homie
You bitch phony, whipped and stripped like a bitch pony
Tripped and get kicked in the ribs this is it homie
You slipped and I'm pissed so I flick my wrist only
As thick as the mist when I rip the piff, toe me
The jist of this shit when I mix the mix homie
The notes DO TI LA SO FA MI and flip DO RE
My prospective needs a prospectus, my concepts is electric
Conceptions eluding the rudest electives
Electoral selections, selective on erect consensus
Your senses sense what the cents is, the scent
That I sent the dentures, meant what I meant in the tent
The dent ventures, adventing inventions
For adventurous adventures, demented
As the dementia repents the sense to mention
Rubber band man, in dubs or vans man
Clubs in the crammed stands, thugs in Grand Ams
Snug as a bug in a rug on the drugs he can't stand
Candy land, white candy damn handy man
Knock knock this ain't a fuckin joke
Handful of mushrooms like the toad in Mario
Bro if you ask me why'd the chicken cross the road
I just went and fucked his chick cuz he owed me dough, bro
Damn
