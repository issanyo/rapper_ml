[II: Thotful"]

[Verse: Drake]
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so bad, girl, you're so awful
I fuck you right in my office
You go tell your friends you're honest
That's why all your friends are on
You know you made me a promise
We're not in this for commitment
Your man's gone and you don't miss him
Book you flights and confirmation
Southwest Airlines you'll still take it
Hell of a week for you chasin' that paper
Even though you're exhausted, you're still gonna make it, girl
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so, you're so
You love to get two

[Outro: Drake]
And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know that I put you on
And you know, that's something you know
And you know, you love to get two on
