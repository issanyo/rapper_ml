"Tell Me Lies" - Scene 1

[Verse 1: Melissa McIntyre as Ashley Kerwin]
You say it's simple, it's who you ought to be
Look in the mirror, you are not what you see
You say it's simple, but aren't your wings tired?
To tell the truth, why do you have to hide?

[Interlude: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
Look, me and the mic, we coexist
My flow is a glass box with no exits
And you can observe while you trapped in it
Took my lady's track and I sprinkled some rap in it
They telling me lies

[Bridge: Melissa McIntyre as Ashley Kerwin]
What's wrong with being someone else?
No shame, and living life their way, tell me lies

[Interlude: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
They like, "Please, please tell us your reality, J!
We can't fathom how it feel to be forever confined."
My mother always told me what to do with my best foot
So to this day, you know that it is never behind
And, metaphorically, I'm ahead of the rest
And proud of the fact that I've accomplished that
And every time I say that I can do it myself
In the same breath, I wonder where my accomplice at
It's like

[Hook: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now

"Tell Me Lies" - Scene 2

[Verse: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
Look, me and the mic, we coexist
My flow is a glass box with no exits
And you can observe while you trapped in it
Took my lady's track and I sprinkled some rap in it
And now they like, "Please, please tell us your reality, J!
We can't fathom how it feel to be forever confined."
My mother always told me what to do with my best foot
So to this day, you know that it is never behind
And, metaphorically, I'm ahead of the rest
And proud of the fact that I've accomplished that
And every time I say that I can do it myself
In the same breath, I wonder where my accomplice at
Cause the fabrication would help to settle that
And imagination would ease the pain
I came into this world as honest and pure
But can't guarantee to you that I'mma leave the same, so

[Hook: Drake as Jimmy Brooks, (Melissa McIntyre as Ashley Kerwin)]
(Tell me lies)
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now
(Tell me lies)
Tell me anything but the truth
Can't figure out how I'm supposed to make it now
(Tell me lies)
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now
(Tell me lies)
Tell me anything but the truth
Can't figure out how I'm supposed to make it now, tell me lies

[Outro: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
I said, tell me lies
