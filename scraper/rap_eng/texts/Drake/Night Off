Spending every moment in the studio
I never said it'd be fair
But when you're all alone
I hope you truly know
How bad I want to be there

Come right in
Set your bag down
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fitting for what I'm about to do

No you ain't explaining how you want it done
Just be quiet I'll be fine without your help girl
Can you work without a second for some fun
Now you finally got a moment to yourself girl
And I know what to do wit it
I know what to do wit it
I know what to do wit it
I know what to do wit it
Oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

Yeah
I've been waiting for so long to get you all alone
Now I finally got you right here
So baby imma lock my door and disconnect my phone
Cuz I wanna make one thing clear

I want you on top
So let your hair down
I took the night off for you
Girl I'm gonna
Turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fitting for what we're about to do

Come right in
Set your bag down
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fitting for what I'm about to do

No you ain't explaining how you want it done
Just be quiet I'll be fine without your help girl
Can you work without a second for some fun
Now you finally got a moment to yourself girl
And I know what to do wit it
I know what to do wit it
I know what to do wit it
I know what to do wit it

Its 6 o'clock in the morning at the studio...
