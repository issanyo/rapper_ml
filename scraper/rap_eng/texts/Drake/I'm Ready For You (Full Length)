[Drake: Verse 1]
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over. Baby she's over
I've decided to give you all of me
Baby come closer, baby come closer
I'm ready for ya!
Kill 'em all, switch it up
Put it on, zip it up
Let my perfume, soak into your sweater
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better
No option for her, you sayin' no
I run this game, just play your role
Follow my lead, whatchu waitin' fo'?
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night

(Background voice)
Yeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter
Got my mind made up. I-I-I'm ready for ya
I'm in control, but with you bein' a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I-I'm ready for ya
I-I-I'm ready for ya
I-I-I'm ready for ya
So keep thinkin' you the man
Cause it's all part of my plan
I-I-I'm ready for ya
Nothin' on, I strut around
I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me
Mental picture, no cameras please
(Background voice)

[Drake - Verse 2]
Uh, red lipstick on the wine glass cameras in my mind
Flash, black lingerie white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass, you say you want it fast
Define fast, cause I can speed it up, and make it last
And I could audition for this, and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure you never forget it, commited, im ready, im with it
Still here like a statue, pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got bagges, well im packed too, plus I got a sex pistol
Pointed right at you "BANG!", the baddest women ever in the heart of south
Proven over and over again thats why im hard to doubt, plus im
Young money 'till the death, I took the carter route
Im more than ready too, hope of something that you thought about
[Hook]

[End]
