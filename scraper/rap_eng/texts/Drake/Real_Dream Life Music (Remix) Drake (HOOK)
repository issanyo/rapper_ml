Drake :

Would've came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know

[Interlude]
Hope you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you
Would've came back, would've came back

Lil Mel :

Never on my mind to change
I just stay the same
See my life image is plain
Now addin a frame
Do what I want for me
Overlooking the rest
I just express the truth
And hope for the best
I was taught to be independent
So me standing alone is not really nothing new
Moms told me grow up and make the right variety in life
Now I guess it’s about time I choose
I would love to see the faces of those who tried
Cuz like a new car in highschool  they wantin a ride
But No wasn’t with me then not with me now
I see how money sure make em come around
But for now that’s just a dream I’m just hoping for
I wish could step right into fame like an open door
I hate that it’s my fault women lose connection
But I never chase girls so there no real affection
Family over all I stand by that statement
Success is in the air I inhale the greatness
I tell them liers to get use to my lateness
They need to realize themselves to differ the from fakeness
I hate it
Also im way pass judgement calls
I’m not the one to judge
And neither are you
So don’t tell me what you hear
Tell me what you know
If you paid attention to my lyrics tell me what you owe
If I ask you my name do you even know
And if ya dnt know now ya kno

Lil Mel
