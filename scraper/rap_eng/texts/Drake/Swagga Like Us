[Verse]
Are you listening, is anybody listening
Walk into the room, and you can smell the cloud glissening
A lot of niggas is threatened by my positioning
Thrilling balls, you think I'm riding with John Grissonning
I need Rosay, never mind the pricing
Know we brought cake to the party, no icing
No ice on, big Phantom, no licence
Fuck if you feelin me, as long as your wife be
No one in my city got a pocket like Drizzy
I got rock fitted jeans, cause my credit card skinny
It's pitch black, and covers all insedentals
And Mr. Wrong, sorry, you ain't know thismy prosensal
Fuck you rappers and your self proclaimed statis
I can only see green now, have the same paterns
I know you waiting on the last quote, check the sound scan, you can see that I'm the last hope
