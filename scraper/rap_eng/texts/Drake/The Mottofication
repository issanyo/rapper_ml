[Verse 1: Mo Turk]
Akron's finest motherfucker like you didn't know
Crew Life got your bitch in a limbo
Drunk driver make you crash like a cymbol
Peace sign but ain't nothin peaceful
Rap niggas repeat the same episode
Teen mom but I dont like those ugly hoes
Vh1 got 3 or 4 of the same shows
LMFAO same songs every song
I dont know Game of Thrones off with your head
Pitbull calle ocho cinco no bueno man
Bullied nigga now im on the attack
Larisa Oleynik and The Secret World of Alex Mack
I dont play I straight dont like you
That goes for Kim K or anyone by you
Desperate bitches only ones that'll buy you
Fried alligator only in the bayou
Perez Hilton more faggot than a Bieber fan
More STDs than fucking Ke$ha in a van
Do more good than a do gooder can
Always stay sober no drugs Gene Simmons and
Im 19 what do you expect, when the kids graduate and they life is a wreck
And im not perfect, but this ain't 1849 and we have no prospects

[Hook: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 2: Mo Turk]
Two
Tough guys, tough guys
Trynna have sword fight with some butter knifes
Get stabbed in the back bitch you better die
Well I dont know a zombie come back alive
Ass rape a motherfucking werewolf
Turk grizzly get mauled by this bear ooh
White girls just stay wearing Ugg Boots
I mug you grope two pair of nice boobs
How it feel, how it feel, how it feel
They ain't trynna fuck they just only wanna chill
She ain't Heidi Klum how the fuck you club a seal
Blood on the ice red popsicle
Rick ankiel nigga St. Louis Cardinals
Batter on deck, beat bats like Boston
Red and white Jag, plant flowers and they blossom
Kickflip a bitch like fucking awesome
How the fuck she move to this?
When she got gold chains on here neck and wrist
She gotta nice ass
I said baby got back
She said what the fuck do you know about this
