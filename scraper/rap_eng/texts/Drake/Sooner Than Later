[Verse 1]
I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I could do to fix it
All you ever asked me for was time, whoa

[Bridge]
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else

[Hook]
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever, and I realized I waited too long
But please don't move on

[Post-Hook]
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else (you don't need no one)
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else

[Verse 2]
You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go, whoa

[Bridge]
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else

[Hook]
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever and I realized I waited too long
But please don't move on

[Post-Hook]
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else (you don't need no one)
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else

[Verse 3]
The girl or the world? They say someone gotta lose
I thought that I can have it all, do I really got to choose?
What good is all the cash if it doesn't buy time?
And what good is being famous if I'm never on your mind
Nights fallen, lights glowing
And I'm just trying to pay the price owing
And I don't want to feel the comfort from my ice showing
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga, nice going, is it worth it? That decision
'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision
So I'ma dust my shirt and fix my pants
'Cause I better look good, girl, if this my chance, I swear

[Hook]
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever and I realize I waited too long
But please don't move on

[Post-Hook]
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else (you don't need no one)
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
