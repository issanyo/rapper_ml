[Verse 1: Jenna Gawne]
They can say that you're no good, so hood
Truth is that you hold me down, my baby, just maybe
They just can't see how much your love changed me
It made me who I am right now so they don't phase me
When they blaze me with all of their worries

[Pre-Chorus: Jenna Gawne]
You probably ain't gonna change but I'm okay with that
Yeah, baby, I stay on track, 'cause you know that I got your back
And you probably ain't gonna change your ways but that's alright
Still be down to ride, 'cause you're my one and only

[Chorus: Jenna Gawne]
Anything that you need from me, boy
All that you do is just let me know
Cause I know deep down who you are
And I ain't tryna change that part at all
Anything that you need from me, boy
All that you do is just let me know
Cause I know deep down who you are
And I ain't tryna change that part at all

[Verse 2: Jenna Gawne]
They can say what they want to but it ain't true
They can't see you're [?] for me
Cause I know better than to let a
Bunch of them stop telling me
Cause I would never wanna give you up, so why
Do they keep talking when they know that it ain't right?
No, no, no
Can't tell me nothing 'bout my baby

[Pre-Chorus: Jenna Gawne]
You probably ain't gonna change but I'm okay with that
Yeah, baby, I stay on track, 'cause you know that I got your back
And you probably ain't gonna change your ways but that's alright
Still be down to ride, 'cause you're my one and only

[Chorus: Jenna Gawne]
Anything that you need from me boy
All that you do is just let me know
Cause I know deep down who you are
And I ain't tryna change that part at all
Anything that you need from me boy
All that you do is just let me know
I got you, girl
Cause I know deep down who you are
And I ain't tryna change that part at all

[Verse 3: Drake]
Stance on, lean, the same old thing girl
There ain't a damn change that the fame gon' bring, girl
Uh, I'm first string, girl, handle a lot
'Cause up north is a scandalous spot
They think I'm pretty and rich
But pick one I'm on a Canada block
In some sweatpants, sandals, and socks, 'cause I can do that
I heard rappers wanna get into it
Until they hear the mixtape and they get into it
I used to pay just to get influence
And now I host [?] with [?], so questioning me
Is nonsense, my advancement is a definity
Something that you rappers pressing to see, and I can do that
You need cash? Sure, I'll make it rapid for ya
You need it faster? I'll make it happen for ya
I bring drama in town, but don't worry
I'ma pull my pants up when your mama around, girl

[Chorus: Jenna Gawne]
Anything that you need from me boy
All that you do is just let me know
Cause I know deep down who you are
And I ain't tryna change that part at all
Anything that you need from me boy
All that you do is just let me know
Cause I know deep down who you are
And I ain't tryna change that part at all
