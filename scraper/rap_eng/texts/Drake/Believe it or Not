[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
I’m so fucking dumb, I wear diamonds on my thumbs
There’s a diamond on my dick so there's a diamond on her tongue
I can’t feel you baby cause I'm romantically numb
Emotionally drained. I came here just so I can cum
There's nothing under God's sun that I haven’t done
I got a lot of problems, getting pussy just isn’t one
Girls is like buses: every 15 min. they run
Now they like potato chips: I just cannot have one
And I might like you for a minute
But I don't like your friends in my business
And I don't feel like you deserve a visit
Cause you ain't in the kitchen with me water-whipping

[Hook - Drake]
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you probably tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking, boo, but we just don't believe you

[Verse 2 - Drake]

Ok, I’m all about it, all for it
I’m all-star team Jordan, small forward
I’m never putting up a shot unless it calls for it
No hesitation so I’m shooting if I draw for it
What the fuck is up now? Man, I’m in this ho
Life is moving fast: where the fuck do all these minutes go?
Mixtape dropped, then I started getting 10 a show
Now I get a hundred: what the fuck you think I’m in it for?
Young Money forever, I bet Gudda, Jay and Mack agree
"Fuck you" to the haters that just spend their time attacking me
Shout-out to your girlfriend, nigga, lately she distracting me
Wondering if I’m the best? Well-I-am: no Black Eyed Peas
Girls wanna fuck your niggas
Niggas gotta wanna be you
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to
You can say whatever, girl, but we just don’t believe you
