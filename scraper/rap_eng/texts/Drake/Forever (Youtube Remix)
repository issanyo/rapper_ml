[Hook: Ahmir]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man

[Verse 1: Traphik]
I got a question, can anybody answer it
Who gotta flow sicker than Canibus if he was cancerous
Cameras get to flashing with
Every single new fan I get
Granny gets her panties wet
Seducing your mom ‘til the family splits
I’m on a mission to take each girl
Ride her strong, I’ve been savage like Boy Meets World
Jump On It like Apaches
I’m screamin' out Geronimo
Obama flow, if you got bars I’m shuttin' em down, Guantanamo
I speak the truth and that’s why you scared
To MC's, I’m E; you see I’m you squared
And my bars is too heavy I don’t need no muscle
I put pride in my tracks and I ain’t talking ‘bout Russell
My new shit is too hot
Y’all dudes be the phoniest
I’m too sick, my flu shot will give y’all dystonia
We all know that hip-hop was starting to die
I’m taking it back for the future like Marty McFly
I do it for my peoples and they proud when I’m reppin’
And tonight we gone party like it’s 2011

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dyme-A-Duzin]
Back, mister lyrically obscene and out of order
2 milli I did it like Eli Porter
After two videos crushing hip-hop sites
Got the game on smash and I’m a world star, right
And now rappers is usin' smilies to represent 'em
I think they bitin' but I don’t mind 'em or pay attention
The blaze is dying so they need DyMer for some assistance
And they’re just tight because their subscribers is single digits
For the losers I exude super fresh
The tits embedded like the implants that’s in her hooters
I know I’m random but, what’s more, your marketing scandal
Or attempted diss and then soundin’ like Soulja Boy Jr
I’m skeetin’ on your forum
Your blog can give me a b-job as I generate a code for support
The illest on the internet
And you ain’t get it yet
Even in the present the President’s rockin' equal X
You wanna see it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dumbfoundead]
Call me YouTube’s Lebron James
I’m shooting for the stars and my bullets go long range
I have the heart of Avatar and battle scars to prove it
Y’all just opened up a can of worms and I’ma start to lose it
Gotta bigger brain than Lil' Wayne
Make Drizzy sound like Lil' Zane
Make Eminem sound simple and throw Kanye out the window pane
I don’t mean no disrespect
Recognize this kid is next
The internet’s a little step to record execs and bigger checks
Serve the world a la carte
See my victims fall apart
Y’all got fifteen seconds got long distance on my calling card
Rockwell over thousand shows
Shock foreigners from round the globe
Apocalypse flow 2012
Y’all never heard Dumbfoundead though
Let me teach y’all a thing or two
Make y’all look like English students
Never thought you needed tutors, until you heard the teacher’s stupid
Witness a man in his prime
Doing his shit one fan at a time
Standing in line I ain’t taking shortcuts
Y’all are slow so take the shortbus
For us buyers you can call me the people’s champ
Livin’ the dream for all y’all out there scared to take a chance
Dumbfoundead

[Verse 4: Prince Ea]
Do I want this shit forever?
Or just a couple seasons
Maybe neither
Maybe I should crash my jeep now
And wake from dreamin’
I’m doing eighty even speeding down these corners burning rubber
I can feel Satan breathing down my neck
They’re just pleading for me to stop but I can’t
This shit is crazy
And there’s the cops, aww fuck I can’t believe it
I ain’t stopping no
I ain’t going back up in that prison
Plus I left the heater underneath the seat since the weekend
See you wonder why us famous people always stay with needles
It's cause this life right here is crazy homie, believe it
After I sign a deal I didn’t have to raise a finger
Everybody did what I said
‘cause what I said they believed it
All them fellas show me love
And all the women show me cleavage
The kids knew all my songs word for word and said I was Jesus
But I wasn’t leading them to freedom
I was teaching them to keep reaching for things
With no significance and meaning
It was greed that made me poison my own people with these records
I gotta end it all fuck it no more being selfish
The bridge is just after this intersection
So do I want this shit forever
Nah, just a couple more seconds

[Hook]

[Verse 5: D-Pryde]
And this is what you all been waiting for
I’m patient but I’m gonna just take it, the lyrical Asian
Is gonna make things feel sore
Play this all you racists I’ma go show you who’s the nut in town
Shut it down
Boom. I'mma show all you I ain’t fuck around
And now the end is near
Put you all in trembling fear
To all you who think I’m cocky and fucking obnoxious
Let me just get this clear
That shit is old news
I don’t bow to no dude
Wanna call me cocky
Come and put yourself in my cold shoes
A punch line doesn’t make me major or ruthless
All I need to do is be real into what I say in my music
They used to make fun of my dreams
And they would say that they’re stupid
But now I mastered entertainment
Bet you name it I do it
And I’ve crossed so much in this field to get success
I wonder when the fuck am I gonna really give up yet
But people call me out and think I stand there
But fuck that
It’s time to take a stand ‘cause I’m a man with enough stress
Inspired generations
Show everyone I’m famous
Displayin' the fact I’m crazy
I’m raised up in entertainment
To all you racist haters and fakers who think you’re major
Get your knees on, shaked. Embrace it
And bow by the time I’m famous
