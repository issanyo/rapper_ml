[Intro]
Damn, I thought I had it all figured it out
Especially when it came to relationships and girls
But just when I least expected it
Love, rearranged my whole world

[Verse 1: Sean Garrett]
Junior high, played 'em, high school, played 'em
College, well, you know, played 'em
Me and my friends used to laugh about it, how we fade 'em
Now cupid’s aiming his arrow right there at me
No more nonchalant can I be, with you here staring at me
With the most beautiful eyes that a nigga ever see
You pull an emotional vibe from my soul, look at me
You got my heart beating like my back is filled with batteries

[Hook: Sean Garrett]
For the first time I’m in love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody what I'm feeling
Said for the first time I feel love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody to feel it

(J. Cole, baby bro, speak)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Not so fast, Cole got a whole lotta lotto cash
Life of a bachelor, light skinned rapper
Found a top model with a Tahoe ass
With a broad so bad, when she cross your path
You get her outta them jeans you be thinking about rings
Okay she done got your ass
Cupid done shot your ass
But I'm trying to be a G though
So yeah, I'm gonna holler, yeah I'm gonna call her
But I ain't got a leash though
Uh, I put a name on a lease though
Get an extra set of my keys for
I think I might wife it now
But life is foul and you don’t got a free throw
Uh, and so my next move gon' have to be my best move
Beside every king is a bad ass queen
So girl let's make this chess move

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sean Garrett]
Now baby, baby
You doin' things with my heart ain't never felt, its so crazy
I agree to acknowledge love if you gonna let it change me
I was so mistaken
Your love like a Bentley coupe, took me out of a Mercedes
Now baby baby, for so long I miss somebody
My heart just couldn’t played with it
I went from not wanting a girlfriend to needing ya lady
I didn’t think I'd ever see
Me callin' to you, you voice before I go to sleep

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Sean Garrett]
I ain’t never looked into a woman’s eye worth of fire
Bet I’m feelin' while you holdin’ me begging to take you higher
For so long I wasn’t faded, I couldn’t admitted before
But now I see what life’s about, and I’m never goin’ let you go
Girl I’m growin’
(Don’t wanna be selfish, I wanna be more accountable)
I see us growing
(Don’t wanna miss out on a feeling I ain't never had before)
I got to tell the world, somebody gotta know
What you done done to me, I gotta let ’em know

[Hook]

[Verse 5: J. Cole]
I’d swore I’d never fall, but I fell
Run and tell all my old hoes
Erase my number, my photos
Uh, baby girl pardon me but
Don’t text, stop calling me
I ain't your nigga, don’t bother me
Fuck your Twitter, don’t follow me
My new girl too thorough
Believe it or not, man, she’s all I need
Thought I was a player, R.I.P
Down goes Frazier, call Ali
Let's hit the mall and its all on me
Cause girl you deserve it
If I take this chance and make these plans
I gotta know girl is you worth it? Perfect
