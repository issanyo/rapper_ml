What we doing Drake? (We bag jackin, bitches!)
What we doing Drake? (We bag jackin, bitches!)
Take your whole bag of candy, leave you in the cold
So bring the ruckus if you under 12 years old

[Jay Pharaoh]
It's 7:58 and now your curfew is pushin
Watch how just like Republicans I'm behind the bushes
"It wasn't me" - if you asked me, that's what I'mma tell ya
And I'mma eat so much chocolate, my blood type's Nutella
Got wanted signs from madd parents, state troopers
Kidnapped Willy Wonka and bitch-slapped an Oompa-Loompa

[Drake]
Give me your Reese's Pieces, give me your Hershey bars
I want your Milky Way, give me that Snickers bar
I would Trick-or-Treat but I'm too old now
So I snatch your bag so I don't look like a pedophile
My sticky fingers got all of these mamas mad at me
We're talking stomach aches, restraining orders, cavities
I probably won't have no teeth when I'm finished
I don't pay for the porcelains, I just marry my dentist
