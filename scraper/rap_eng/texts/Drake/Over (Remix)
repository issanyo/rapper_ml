[Intro: Hyper Crush]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hyper Crush Remix
Hyper Crush in this bitch until it's over
Hyper Crush in this bitch until it's over

[Hook: Drake]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back but
What am I doing? What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'm going to do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

Drizzy

[Verse 1: Drake]
Bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch: Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas

[Verse 2: Hyper Crush]
Time to go Vanilla Ice, white rapping for a living
That's the passion that I give them, sarcasm so they listen
My flow is so hyper, the club is what we crush
And I'm focused like a sniper, we ain't over 'til it's done

[Hook: Drake]

[Verse 3: Hyper Crush]
Message on my beeper, "Make them a believer"
About to do it big in this bitch, Queen Latifah
I came here to dance, everyone's acting cool
About to teach them we run shit back to school
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hyper Crush in this bitch until it's over
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hyper Crush in this bitch until it's over

[Hook: Drake]
