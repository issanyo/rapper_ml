[Verse 1: PG]
Shorty so fly , cookie so fresh
Playing with her coochie while I'm sucking on her chest
I nearly lost my mind when I seen her get undressed
Body of a goddess and a smile to match the set
Baby you blessed
Dimples on her cheeks match the dimples on her back
Left some hickies on her neck
Blew a eighth with her before the 2nd round of sex
I swear to god I almost drowned in that pussy for a sec
Fuck it I know you love it
Kissing you out in public
Do you how you want it
How these other bitches never done it
Baby ill keep you cumming from night to early morning
Different tricks and shit to switch it up to keep from getting boring
Know what that pussy yearning
Something to to keep it yearning
From night to early morning I know how to keep it purring
Never know what you had til its gone
Call my phone, looking forward to that pussy later on, like

[Hook:Drake]: Call me crazy -- shit, at least youâ€™re calling
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know its easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get right

[Verse 2: PG]
And I'm not only tryna get up in ya jeans
Been tryna climb that mountain to reach the peak in ya dreams or whatever
Feel you up with ice to make it cream
Even better,ill have you squirting out and leave you screaming with pleasure
She told me I gotta chill cause that happens hardly ever
Playing with her pussy I can feel her getting wetter
So I took action and triggered that shit
Pussy went to twitching juices shot out hella quick
Baby, you gone learn, sweated out her perm
Body still trembling, I guess we taking turns
She told me she wan' taste but baby that can wait
I ate it but I'm not finished until I licked the plate
Said I'm addicted to you and baby only you
Pretty in the face even better in the nude
Never know what you had til its gone
On the phone writing lyrics bout that pussy in this song like

[Hook]
