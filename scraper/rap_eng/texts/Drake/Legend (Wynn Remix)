[Pre-Hook]
When I pull up on a hater watch a hater fall back
I'm too good with these hands, watch a hater fall flat
If I die, all I know I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's so great for my city, I'm the realist one that's rappin

[Hook]
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
When they made me down the rest, I know I was always rappin
Oh my God, my whole life, my words been ma greatest weapon
I know I. I know I, been the cos greatest blessings

[Verse 1]
Didn't recognize a king when he rappin with you
You always suck it like you always bring a vacuum with you
Sounded like a man that canpachine plastic gives you
Cause if you got up on a pick, I got imagine issue

[Pre-Hook]
Talking about me then it got a be lies
Cause I never get a tag or a chance to reply
If you don't got the courage to answer me
Then you could fuck yourself, but you would fall until the battery dies
I mean you're mad at me why? Cause I had to be fly
Two albums in a year and I can't even try
Tried to fill my shoes that you had to re size
I'm the king, I'm the throne, bitches where I was at

[Hook]
When I pull up on a hater watch a hater fall back
I'm too good with these hands, watch a hater fall flat
If I die, all I know I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's so great for my city, I'm the realist one that's rappin

[Hook]
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
When they made me down the rest, I know I was always rappin
Oh my God, my whole life, my words been ma greatest weapon
I know I. I know I, been the cos greatest blessings
