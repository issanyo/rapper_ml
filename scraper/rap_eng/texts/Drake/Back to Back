[Verse 1: Nuevo]
I learned the game from myself and I wasn't messing
Back to back like my girl when she didn't see my message
Back to back like I was taking pills fighting depression
Back to back ghost writing like my name was Quentin
Oh
Very important on my checklist
I'm a warrior of the gold like my name was Festus
Aye
I'm going to show you who the boss is
Don't care about my conscience
I want to see my dudes switching lanes
You going to make me lose all my morals to fame
You going to make me the God like Charlemagne
You going to make me Young Money like Lil Wayne
I been waiting for the pay where y'all at?
I came here with a plan that's to take y'all back
I really don't know why we are wearing these masks
But I guess it's what we got to do to stick to the plan
Ya see oh
I took the car and you drove a bus
You cold but you ain't cold enough
This for y'all who think that I'm not old enough
They just mad cause they are not bold enough

[Verse 2]
You is gay what you have a girl for?
You can't afford world tours or your girls tour
So why would you go and buy the bus for
This ain't what she meant when she said to spend your bread more
Trigger fingers leave your fingers bitter
You getting killed by my bigger figures
I'm not the type of singer that'll fight a drinker
And you know just that one shot leave you injured
