She can make it go
Bring it high, bring it down
Take it low
Then make it go
She can make it go
Start off going fast but then she take it slow
Then make it go
She can make it

She make it
Then it sound like (sound like)
(X4)
[Belly]

Now baby, now baby you know just who I am
You heard that shit with Kurupt
Girl Im the fucking man
I know you got a dude but he don’t understand
I take you to an Island he can’t even buy you sand
I put it down right (down right)
Me I need a queen to wear that crown right
I can turn your long days into loud nights
Girl I flip it, turn it over, touch it make it sound like
When it come to pussy Im a connoisseur
I can fuck you till your a lot more than kinda sore
Girl Im a dog with a bone like a dinosaur
I make you scream, grind your teeth
Make you climb the walls
So fly you divide the law

I tell her, I tell her
We not just any guys
I bet they're broke for a reason, no need to empathize
I tell Patrone truths, I tell you Henny lies
And you believe em all
I can see em in your eyes
I take you down like (down like)
Me without no money that don’t sound right (sound right)
I can put you on this outta town flight

And even have a driver pick u up girl what that sound like (sound like)
I gets big big money, all this money
I dont even know what to call this honey
Take so long just to get to the point where you rich
And you there and its oh so funny
I stunt so they can see me
And therefore they should know
They call me Drizzy baby
Wanna see you make it go
