[Hook: Belly]
She can make it go..
Bring it high, bring it down, take it low..then make it go..
She can make it go..
She start off going fast but then she take it slow (she take it slow)
Then make it go (she take it slow)
She can make it..
She make it then it sound like (sound like)
She make it, then it sound like (YEAH)
She make it, then it sound like (sound like)
She make it, then it sound like..

[Belly: Verse 1]

She does it to me like i never felt it, I can't help it
Helpless, melting in her presence, I am selfish she can tell this
She can tell me anything; I'll buy it if she sells it
Told me her name is heaven, but she's hotter than hell is
Love locked down; I'll be your felon
Wait.. she love to get her pussy ate like Ellen
One two, you can come she can come too
You gon' cum, she gon' cum too
Pass out, & do it all again when we come to
We can kick it like a shoe.. KungFu
She make it stop, pop like the drum do
These bitches typical, you show me sumthin' new

[Belly: Hook]

[Drake: Verse 2:]
I tell her, I tell her:
We not just any guys
I bet they broke for a reason, no need to empathize
I tell patron truths, i tell you henny lies
And you believe'em all; I can see it in your eyes
I take you down like (down like)
Me without no money, that don't sound right (sound right)
I could put you on this side of town flight
And even have a driver pick you up girl, what that sound like (sound like)
I guess big big money, all this money
I don't even know what to call this honey
Takes so long just to get to the point where you're rich and you're there and its all so funny
I stunt so they can see me, & therefore they should know
They call me Drizzy baby, wanna see you 'make it go'

[Drake: Hook]
She can make it go
Bring it high, bring it down, take it low, then make it go
She can make it go; start off going fast but then she take it slow, take it slow
She can make it..
She make it & it sound like (sound like)
She make it, & it sound like (LIKE)
She make it, & it sound like (sound like)
She make it, & it sound like: (sound like)(sound like)
Uh
