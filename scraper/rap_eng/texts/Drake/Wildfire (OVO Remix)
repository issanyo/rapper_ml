[Verse 1: little Dragon]
I could bet all the riches that i ever had
Rushing the night like a shark babe
Would it be bad
If i had to set the alarm
Cus those thrills that run up my back
You are my star
Nothing else can lead me off track

Hey
You like a wildfire
You got me rising high
Your innocence
Whose the brave
Drowning in
Would you save me
It's a crime
If you don't
You're the spy
By the throat

Rushing the night like a shark babe
Would it be bad?

Hey, yeah
You like a wildfire
You got me rising high
Your innocence
Whose the brave
Drowning in
Would you save me
It's a crime
If you don't
You're the spy
By the throat
