(Verse 1)
Heading nowhere fast baby tell me what’s the rush
You know it takes a toll falling in and out of love
Hit you with the truth ‘cause its things to discuss
He ain't got the truth so I see it as a plus
Here it go, got the proof for ya (proof for ya)
The other nigga used to you, giving nothing but abuse to you
Tell me that shit usual (usual)
It’s so unusual, that is nothing new to you
I been analyzing ever since we gave it time (time)
In too deep it’s weighing heavy on my mind (mind)
You been drinking heavy, I just see it as a sign (sign)
You’ve been in denial ‘cause you tell me that you fine
Aw yea, in the least bit (least bit)
All I see is you picking up the pieces
We all die, in our lives there are secrets
Soft prize, in my ride I’m the one you should be with
Going thru the sequence
Yea

(Chorus)
You don’t nothing, better know your worth
No discounts, getting all you deserve
Better know your worth (worth)
Aw yea
See I’m riding ‘round the city and I’m stuck on you
Got that thang sitting pretty tryna fuck with you
Girl, I’m on my way

(Refrain)
I’m doing 180 on the interstate
Got you rushing home ‘cause you feel a way
Pull up with that passion, look you in your face
Bring you from those shackles, put you in your place
Do you know your worth? (worth)
See I’m riding ‘round the city and I’m stuck on you
That thang sitting pretty tryna fuck with you
Girl I’m on my way

(Verse 2)
I was always there when you need sum’n
And your mama said that we can be sum’n
See you running low better re-up
[?] I can pick your energy up, (yea)
Lately I’ve been going through those bottles of that Ace
The deeper that I get then the more I see your face
Getting harder to resist and I know you need your space
But you sending mixed emotions ‘cause you’re going through your phase
Feelings coming down, I feel we running out of time (time)
Regrets with common burdens weighing heavy on my mind
[?] get you wet and he just hang you on the line (line)
Hang you out to dry, he forgot you over time
Used to hit me up on the late night too
Latex, safe sex, came right thru
Say you weren’t sure even when you got proof
See you living with a lie, you confused by the truth
Awwwwwww man

(Chorus)
If you don’t nothing, better know your worth
No discounts, getting all you deserve
Better know your worth
Aw yea, yea, yea
See I’m riding ‘round the city and I’m stuck on you
Got that thang sitting pretty tryna fuck with you
Girl, I’m on my way

(Refrain)
I’m doing 180 on the interstate
Got you rushing home ‘cause you feel a way
Pull up with that passion, look you in your face
Bring you from those shackles, put you in your place
Do you know your worth? (worth)
See I’m riding ‘round the city and I’m stuck on you
And that thang sitting pretty tryna fuck with you
Do you know your worth?
Worth, worth, worth, worth, worth, worth, worth
Do you know your worth?
Worth, worth, worth, worth, worth, worth, worth

(Bridge)
I wouldn’t lie to you
Good love providing you
From late nights to sliding through
What you decide to do?
Remains with you

Feelings coming down, I feel we running out of time (time)
[?] get you wet and he just hang you on the line
Hang you out to dry, he forgot you over time
Regrets with common [?] weighing heavy on my mind
Used to hit me up on the late night too
Latex, safe sex, came right thru
Say you weren’t sure even when you got proof
See you living with a lie, you confused by the truth
Aww man

(Chorus)
If you don’t nothing, better know your worth
No discounts, getting all you deserve
Better know your worth (worth)
Aw yea
See I’m riding ‘round the city and I’m stuck on you
Got that thang sitting pretty tryna fuck with you
Girl, I’m on my way

(Refrain)
I’m doing 180 on the interstate
Got you rushing home ‘cause you feel a way
Pull up with that passion, look you in your face
Bring you from those shackles, put you in your place
Do you know your worth? (worth)

(Outro)
See I’m riding ‘round the city and I’m stuck on you
And that thang sitting pretty tryna fuck with you
Do you know your worth?
