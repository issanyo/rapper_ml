I don't think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store close
And blow the fee from my last 4 shows
I do one song and use four flows
She use to be a Christian before
But now all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes
Like baby those are cute I adore those
Me & the salesman build a rapport so
He understands the fact that I'm spending offshore dough
Cash only, transactions homie
And please no receipts the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they dont know I bought it
I been doin this for years homie, thoroughly I thought it
Through, what it do? I am currently recording on a track admitting most of my Currency’s imported
But too late now, it too legitimate to hit 'em with
Lawsuits even if those are acts that I did commit
Repeat offender, Anita Baker
Playin' in the whip as they pull me over my sweet surrender
I gotta jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A real Menschkeit as they say he’s a legal bender
And ATF is present every regal member
The coalition, is so efficient
You have to be invited or there's no admission
We know tradition
We spend money so don't try to compete if you're in no position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is solely fit for this shoe it fits in
Use to record in the basement that rennie grew his piff in
When pops turned over the keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen 'til I mention that I wanna play a new position
No team playin', no screen settin'
Because I wanna win games, coach I'm through assistin'
The take over, the break's over, nigga
And I'm a keep killin' em until the day that Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshittin' but I'm equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality's so eager to hate something
And try to play it off like it ain't jumpin'
And it's the predicament that you found Drake in
The condo that I just purchased is sound vacant
Cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinkin' what I coulda done to make my first video ground breaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic
Aside from talkin bout the d I'm throwin' in ya' wife
I treat this one session as if it was my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life
