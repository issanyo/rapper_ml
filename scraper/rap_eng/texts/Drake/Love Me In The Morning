[Verse 1: B-Eazy (Kid Dream-Away)]
Man I swear the way she hurt me left my heart so cold
Left it zero below twenty swear that joint froze
Constanly attacked by memories inside of my brain
But I'm numb now can bearly even feel the pain
I'm tryna maintain and stay from going insane
I was chasin' love and got left with heart break
Now I'm sittin' here wondering how much more could I take
All the while I'm thinking that it was all just fate
That I would have to take this pain one day anyway
Like I was standing on thin ice with concrete shoes
The ice breaking was me losing you
But maybe it was a good thing and help me clear to see
That every pretty face ain't always good for me
We always ended up fussin' and fightin'
Then slowly turns to touchin' and bitin'
Skin against skin the anger and passion blends
We get lost in the mood, I'm feelin' all over you
You tellin' what to do, I'm givin' you what you want
I'm givin' you what you need, you scratching all over me
The pain and please you see, makes a good remedy
For all that we been through, you makin' me feel good as much as I'm makin' you
Now that its through you can see that its true, that no one can do it better
And now that we done made love, if I'm here when you wake up
Would you love me in the morning? (Repeat)

[Verse 2: Sikness]
Wakin' in the morning, last night I had her moanin'
Baby too fine, look even better from behind
One of a kind, rare a predictably hard to find
Had to make her mine, come on yeah you know what I mean
Something straight out a magazine or movie screen, baddest thing I ever seen
Met her first in my dreams, yeah had the chance to make her scream
Yeah she like it in the morning, tearing up the room man like ya stonin'
Yeah do what I do and do it best, yeah after that shawty rubbin' on my chest
And I'm a tell ya right now Sik the best, baby girl I'm tellin' you right now I'm better than the rest
Its all gravey baby don't play me, yeah baby girl yeah I'm crazy
And all the hoes hate it, the dudes won't take it
But this mine shawty yeah don't mistake it
And I'm the one that got her naked
I'm the one that got her screamin' in the morning.
