Phone Call (Gillio):
Hey, how you doin?
Look I just I can't stop thinking about you
I-im sorry I made a mistake
I just want to be with you
I just wanna tell you what I feel
I just need to look into your eyes...
Please...
Can I come over?"

Verse 1 (Drake):

Cups of the Rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I’ve been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I’ve been drinking so much
That I’ma call her anyway and say

Chorus (Drake):
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
Cause I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he’s not around

(Are you drunk right now?)

I’m just sayin’, you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I’m just sayin’ you could do better
And I’ll start hatin’, only if you make me

Verse 2 (Gillio):
Always by myself now, I never thought I'd be without you
But it's like all this shit I did was just able to cloud you, yeah
Cloud your mind and every thought you have of me, but I just want you
To be happy so I'll fuck off and let you be

And what's most confusing is you never have the time for me
Then complain I don't do shit when you're the one too blind to see
That I had all hopes in it, you were the one that took them away
But I don't even care no more, I don't even hope or pray so
Ima tell you something, for me it's all over
You got me drunk on your lies
But now I'm all sober
Ready to move on to another
But I've still been drinking so much
So I'mma call you anyway and say

Chorus (Drake):
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he’s not around

(Are you drunk right now?)

I’m just sayin’, you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I’m just sayin’ you could do better
And I’ll start hatin’, only if you make me

Verse 3 (Gillio):

I think I'm addicted to all this shit
And everything you put me through
You know I'd cross the world on foot just for the chance to be with you
But now you pushin' limits
Showin' up with other guys
A smile to hide the sadness but it's only a disguise
Cause all these other men have nothing on what I have to offer
I'm burnin with your love and drowning in your water
I've said once before but I'll repeat it even more
That they're just temporary while Im always at your door
I was ready to take you back no matter what you put me through
But now I don't even care no more and the fault belongs to you (you)
Yeah, and the fault belongs to you (you x2)
So what am I supposed to do now
Just forget all of our history
Guess that's the only plan but the reason is a mystery
I'm into you
Cause I know it very well
I guess I was something you were weak enough to sell
I was in a cell, hell, still caught up in your spell
Found the way out now, so I'll grab the mic and fucking yell, hell..
Cause you even laughed that time I fell
Now it's over, cuz I saw inside your shell

''Hello'' (phone)

Outro (Drake):
I’m just sayin’, you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I’m just sayin’ you could do better
And I’ll start hatin’, only if you make me

Phone call (Gillio):
I can't come over? alright
Guess ima just kick it here then uhm
You should stop by if you feel like it, yeah

I hope one day you will realize I did truly care for you
I promise you're gonna miss me being there, putting up with you, refusing to give up on you, you're gonna regret everything
You've done to me including all the damage you've caused and someday
You'll turn back and I won't be waiting for you any longer
I might have been worthless to you but
You'll miss me when I become priceless to another
