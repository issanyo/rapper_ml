[Verse 1: Bae Zay]
I'am watchful to the colors in this gloomy sky
The days have past away so Time needs to die
When I'm with you it go fast but away its too slow
Thinking about each other but Destiny's in the boat
This the Game now I been framed wow
Only to be with you I believe in you
Your the key to unlocking me to do anything, Your the reason why I would sing
And bring joy to this wonderful day, the music had prayed to steal my wonderful Life away
The melody has token too much of an up-ride so let me endorse my
Wonderful skill then tell me later how you feel, This not about the rapper
Or the Trouble he in, Or all the lieing that he's done Forgiving was they sin
Nah
(Hook+Bridge: Drake)
