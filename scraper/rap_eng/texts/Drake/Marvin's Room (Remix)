Ayo, that's her calling pick it up
Ay give me a second alright?
Let me just make sure she's cool and shit
Hello?
Rome

[Verse 1:] Romeo
Aye why you calling my phone if you ain't trippin' on me?
And that chick that I'm with? That was just the homie
But she was more Pocahontas not a Barbie Doll
Answer me this, who's that fuckin' fly on the wall?
But I'm always right
Let me guess, you drunk tonight
Been up three days and that nigga that you like
He don't hit it right
Call me up crying girl
Could never tell when you lying girl
This wasn't no mistake cause you know I'm with the other girl
You been up for three days I'm guessing that you're lonely
Judging by this picture that you sent, I know you're horny
Truth is that I never got over you
When I'm inside of her, I'm wishing I'm inside of you
Saying shit I don't mean but I'm on
I be fucking bitches from the screen
And you say I can't do better than you
So I got two girls that do you times two
And I ain't hating girl do your thing ma
I mean, if you in the club let it shake ma
I guess you could say another man's trash is another man's treasure
I just hope he do you better...

[Verse 2:] Jojo
I have been up three days
Adderall and redbull
This call is a mistake
There’s something strong in this water bottle
I hear you got a new chick
But that’s a little Barbie doll
I feel so pathetic
But you still haven’t heard it all

[Hook 1:] Jojo
Fuck that new girl that you like so bad
She’s not crazy like me I bet you like that
I said fuck that new girl that’s been in your bed
And when you’re in her I know I’m in your head
I’m just saying you can do better
Always turned you out every time we were together
Once you had the best you can’t do better
Baby I’m the best so you can’t do better

[Verse 3: Drake]
Cups of the Rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I’ve been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I’ve been drinking so much
That I’ma call her anyway and say
“Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had--Yeah, Teyana

[Hook 2:] Teyana Taylor and Romeo
I’m just saying, with me you had better
I know your boys have told you that lately
After me, you couldn’t find better
Notice that your new girl ain’t me, ain’t me, yeah
Yeah, girl you think that you could do better
If you could do better go ahead and do your thing girl

[Bridge:] Teyana Taylor
You gon be trippin’ when I’m at a party
You see these niggas lookin’ at my body
You wanna grab me when you see me leaving
Won’t take you back and I’ll give you the reasons;
I told you I’d leave, knowing I wanted to stay
You didn’t try, you let me walk away
Starting to think all niggas are the same
The look on your face tells me that you’re ashamed
Wanted to love you but now I’m afraid
You say you need me and how much you’ve changed
I don’t believe you, it could be just game
Trust isn’t something you give out

[Outro:] Romeo
Fuck that nigga that you with girl
'cus he ain't me, 'cus he ain't me
I say fuck that nigga that you with girl
He can't do it like me
You know he can't do it like me

[Speaking]
Ladies and gentlemen I need a round of applause
For Miss Teyana Taylor, Drizzy Drake, Jojo, and myself Romeo
No Limit Forever
Yeah
It's official
