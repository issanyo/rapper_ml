Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (no)
I'm goin' on them once I get going (goin' on them, get going)

[Chorus]
She tryna take it all off for me
Tryna stay real close to me
I gotta catch myself
I can't play myself
I need to take it easy
Easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy

[Verse 1]
Railiza
You need a... money and visa
And you get what you want, always from me
I can't say "No" when you say "Please"
I can't say "No"
How you shine
You need a... baby with me, uh
And I'm takin' my time, just wait, don't leave
I can't say "No" when you say "Please"
I can't say "No"
You wanna drink like Bajan and dance like Trini, yeah
You want a supermodel pose like mi real friend Winnie (like mi real friend)
Yeah, vacation's done but I'm not finished, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (no)
I'm goin' on them once I get going (goin' on them, get going)

[Chorus]
She tryna take it all off for me
Tryna stay real close to me
I gotta catch myself

[Verse 2]
I stay to myself
I'll explain myself
I can't play myself
Oh, first night
Holy night
Five in the morning, yeah-yeah (Yeah)
And it feels like you're mine
Signs of the times
Oh, what a time
Playin' it right, playin' it perfect
Laughin' it off but I know you're hurtin'
Signs of the times
I say all the time
Taking my time just gets harder to find it
But you're playin' it right, you're playin' me perfect

[Chorus]
She tryna take it all off for me
Tryna stay real close to me
I gotta catch myself
I can't play myself
I need to take it easy
Easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
