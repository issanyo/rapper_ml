Verse 1
Baby let me talk to you let you know who I feel
I'm your fresh prince and yes we are in His will
Let's chill drink some coffee  and let's build
You my baby girl small world let's revolve
I'm your point guard baby call me Chris Paul
We stay up late nights, reading God's laws
No flaws we amazed how is His love draws
Us near no fear so clear
We don't need no shots no beer
We guard our minds so them thoughts we can't hear
Cover my eyes Jezebel looking
She trying to get some space my God keeps pushing
Her out at the place where my wife has the grace
In front my face the Lust is replaced
With His Love that ties like a lace
Tying our shoes for this tagged team race

Verse 2
We got four kids and all of them growing big
A rib from my rib is how God likes gives
You are so fine reminds me of that first night
Club Life we was looking for the type
I was "A" positive you were "O" right
But we gave hearts onto the Savior
Filled with His power and it changed our behavior
Tears of Joy running down on this paper
Call you my baby, my boo, my lady
I choices you from the masses
No ashes in are fire
We clean burning over no worn out tires
An I can be real I ain't scared no Jezebel
Cause in the name of Jesus they can go straight to hell
But I digress from the woman how I be with
Japan Sensei the one I drink my tea wit
It's no half stepping'
My marriage is what I'm repping'
