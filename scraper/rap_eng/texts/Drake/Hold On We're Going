[Refrain]
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

[Pre-Hook]
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

[Hook]
But just hold on, we're going home
But just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
But just hold on, we're going home

[Refrain]
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
Left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

[Pre-Hook]
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

[Hook]
Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home

[Bridge]
You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something
Well you're the girl, you're the one
I gave you everything I loved
I think there's something, baby
Yeah yeah yeah

Just hold on
