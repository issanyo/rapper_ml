Phones blowing up right now but, I ain't tryna talk I'm tryna feel the fight

[Bridge: Mila J]
Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
He don't want no liquor cause He been drinking that dirty
Bring that ace by the case, my bitches with me
Bring some ice for my cup my drink with me

[Hook: Drake & Mila J]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing

[Verse 1: Drake]
And you know what I need from you when I get home
You better not be on the phone
Talking up a storm like you usually do
Talking to Anaja like you usually do
Telling her I never spend time with you
It's hard to find a time we been

[Bridge: Mila J]
Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
He don't want no liquor cause He been drinking that dirty
Bring that ace by the case, my bitches with me

[Verse 2: Future]
I'm familiar with this cash flow
And if you juggin' you can vouch for me
I did it my way, you could vouch for me
I put the cocaine in the powder in the couch homie
Whenever I step outside the house I keep that glockie on me
Bad bitches wanna come by, the paparazzi on me
I got so many bad bitches that I barely want 'em
I'm barely paying attention, baby I need substance
I know you spend some time putting on some makeup and your outfit but

[Hook: Drake & Mila J]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing

[Outro: Mila J]
You doin' me dirty
You doin' me dirty
You doin' me dirty
You doin' me dirty
You know
How'd I let you get me like this, I don't know
But that bitch couldn't save your soul, no
Doin' me dirty, you doin; me dirty
Ooh, how'd I let you get me like this, like this?
You do me so dirty
I haven't even heard from you
How can you live with yourself?
