She all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups
Got no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes (You know we had to go shopping one more time right, I think we forgot something haha)
All we do is shop until we drop
All all all all all we do is shop until we drop
Just throw it in the bag

It's Mr.Throw it in the bag
I just throw it in the bag
I don't know how much it costs but I know this bitch is bad
Walk up to that register like I didn't know it had a tag
I'm no liar I don't front I'm a buy her what she wants
Cause the queen supposed to get what she desire what she wants
If my lady likes to eat, then I'm a buy her restaurants
And she such a boss bitch she can hire who she want
She can help me blow this cream, she the fire to my blunt
You can try it if you want but it's gon cost you
Bags with the G's, jeans with the horseshoe
She can go to work or chill like a boss do
That nigga ain't ya nigga unless he endorse you
They say it ain't trickin if you got it, they lyin'
I say it ain't trickin if you got her, she mine
You niggas ain't gotta worry about her, she fine
My player's card approved, ya'll niggas declined, nice

Uhh Ahhh
We up in Barneys going dumb again
Everytime we leave the manager say, "come again"
Honestly shes probably old enough to be my momma's friend
She just want that feeling back, I make her feel young again
If the card declined you need to check that shit and run again
They don't give you limits when you keep that money coming in
Yeah, just fold some paper round the magnet
As soon as it approve you can throw it in the bag
She mature to say the least
And if I get a car she make sure to pay the lease
She used to have a husband until she found out he cheats
Then she filed for divorce and watched that bank account increase
She got a condo with a view, a house with a pool
He son that's 26 but he just went to away to school
She always show me pictures of him, tell me that's a baby
I hope that I never meet him, that nigga look craaaazy
And I be spending all my lady chips
She got me feeling like my daddy back in 86
Yeah, she say that she lucky that she his
No, I m lucky that you mine baby, you know what it isss

Shorty so nice, I don't mean polite
When I say nice, I mean looking right
And you can't put a price on something looking right
If they ask how much, tell em what it's looking like
Everything I buy fly, it's like I'm booking flights
If I want it I'm a get it, that should not be tooken light
And it's on everything I got a crazy lady
So money ain't a thing, Jay-z, JD
Like Jay-Z lady, it's Beyonceing
Supporting your woman goes beyond paying
Watching me ball is like LeBron playing
I'm in the Louie shoes you might see Kanye in
They say it ain't trickin if you got it, they lyin'
I say it ain't trickin if you got her, she mine
You niggas ain't gotta worry about her, she fine
