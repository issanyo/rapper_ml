Future by lil young blood

Future time baby
Todays the past
Tomorrows the future
I saw my life flash before my eyes
The future is gonna be great
I’ll have no one to hate
I have fate for my future
I’ve been late for class
My grass will soon will soon be green
I’m gonna be living in big houses
Dreams will be fulfilled
Sometimes dreams are killed
I’ll have my own sponsors
Saying you don’t need dreams to live it up
I’ll soon be an all star
(VERSE 1)
My future with the cars
I’ll be glorious with all my glory
All I’ll care about is the money and the girl I’m with
Don’t forget the family that raised me
I’ll keep the sunshine
Average people will get the rainstorm
(END OF VERSE 1)
I’ll soon have the world over my head
My girl has been in my bed
My rhythm and beat would
Take me to the big times
I will never do drugs
I fucking hat thugs
Receiving all that attention
Feels all happy inside
Everyone will love me
Kids will look up to me
Girls would wish to be with me
Boys will try to be like me
No niggas that will only be for Halloween
Haha
(VERSE TO END THE SONG)
My future with the cars
I’ll be glorious with all my glory
All I’ll care about will be the money
And the girl I’m with
Nigga don’t forget about my family
(END OF SONG)
