[Verse 1: Cryptic Wisdom]
You say your not just like the last one
That I wouldn't regret with you
But part of me thinks that you just said that
So I would get with you
You see it's hard to trust somebody
When my heart was taken
And torn from my sleeve
And I was left to pick it off the pavement
If I'm not mistaken
You and I together would be nice
But I've already been broken up
And I will not do this twice
Because the further I progress in music
Love's hard to find
I don't know whose fake or not
And I can't find me another heart like mine
In the darkest shines
..
It was thrown back at me
I won't do that again cause I've had enough
But I like you
And I think you like me too
But it's such a gamble
Over all after what I've been through

[Hook: Drake]
I swear, I always fall for your type (yeah)
For your type
Tell me why, I always fall for your type (ohhohh)
For your type
I just can't explain this shit at all!
I just can't explain this shit at all!
I just can't explain this shit at all!
I just can't explain this shit at all!
Never believed in people like you!

[Verse 2: Cryptic Wisdom]
I fall for women swearing their true as the blueist skies
They want C-Dubb and not David G
I see through their lies
But then you came along
And told me I was beautiful inside
And now without my music to me thats unusual
But you should know that I was scarred
And I ain't listenin'
Despite the fact that
Everything inside is saying stick with this
And I ain't trippin' that's just now
That since my guard is up
It's hard to love another
And I wish you wouldn't call my bluff
How do you do what you do to me
I'm on my toes
Often it grows
Hard to know that I'll be on the road
And away from you
I don't need the distraction, but
I don't think I'd ever forgive myself if I passed it up

[Hook: Drake]
I swear, I always fall for your type (yeah)
For your type
Tell me why, I always fall for your type (ohhohh)
For your type
I just can't explain this shit at all!
I just can't explain this shit at all!
I just can't explain this shit at all!
I just can't explain this shit at all!
Never believed in people like you!
