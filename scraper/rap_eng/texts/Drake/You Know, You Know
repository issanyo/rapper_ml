[Verse 1]
Uh, you know you know how the story goes
You done jocked my style, you done stole my flow
You done seen me out, you gets no hello
And you wonder why? Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in ’02, and everybody sayin' I'm the man, so true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but I'm still playin' like I'm bein' scouted til I'm out it
Game time bitch, I hope you're proud of us
King James shit watch me throw the powder up
This OG got my whole suite cloudin' up
And I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know

[Verse 2]
Uhh, please make your long story shorter
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and don’t get held up at the border
Yeah so you can spare me all the accolades
I'm the reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And I'm still spendin' money from my actin' days
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a 7 figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin' strings
So we're courtside when LeBron get a fuckin' ring
Yeah, I bet I be there I be there
You see that ’62 sittin outside? That's me there
I'm jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare
Putting in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishin' I could have done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin'
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin'
Damn, what happened to us?
Life can always change, you have to adjust
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flyin' through the door
And kindly ignore, the paparazzi outside tryin to record
Why has every woman never dined here before?
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
The Rothschilds, the Cru's, the Gajas and the Opuses
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
I'm just really hopin that that isn’t what the motive is
They ain't rooting for me, they ain't clapping for me
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me?
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know
