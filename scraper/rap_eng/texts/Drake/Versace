[Drake] Chorus
Versache [x35]
[Stamo Songz[
Yeah we kill and get te money
Hey nigga this is funy
I keep the bitches crazy but tonight I make em busy
The rap was there before I born Im hustling
Dont try to pour me water her is the warning danger zone
My lil niggas from Spain are smoking cocain
Big money big bank young nigga big stomach tomuch money I feed em more Im hustling
I was the soccer player now Imma fucking the world
[Versace x16]
Stamo Songz2
This is summer summer summer summer summer time
Each and every time I make sure that I make em dance
Never miss me baby if you get a chance
Im in the blue beach
Stamo make a change
You can't believe
2.4 is a million
In rands its a billion
Yeah
