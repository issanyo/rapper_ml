[Verse 1: Drake]
The clock that you’ve been watching has been stopping
He makes you wait
What kind of man does that to a girl he loves
If you just give tonight to me
I promise my hands will say
They'll say

[Chorus: Drake]
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don’t show no mercy
Oh, oh think about the last time I came through
Had something more than a gift for you
And I ain't only fuck you like that on your birthday
Oh, oh baby I just landed
'Bout to get my bags in
All I need’s an address and I’m on my way
Don’t fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it’s worth waiting for
Because I’m on my way

[Verse 2: James Fauntleroy]
Won't hurt, it's just some turbulence we're dropping
Dont be afraid
If you fall right here in love with me in my bed
I'll keep you safe, so safe

[Chorus: Drake]
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don’t show no mercy
Oh, oh think about the last time I came through
Had something more than a gift for you
And I ain't only fuck you like that on your birthday
Oh, oh baby I just landed
'Bout to get my bags in
All I need’s an address and I’m on my way
Don’t fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it’s worth waiting for
Because I’m on my way

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Ahh ohhh, I'm on my way
Ahh ohhh, I'm on my way
Ahh ohhh, I'm on my way
Ahh ohhh, I'm on my way
