Verse:
Yeah yeah uh
I'm feelin' you, gauranteed that you into me
I got the phantom, the aston, the bent-e-ley
But let me tell you where a nigga at mentally
Two things I don't give a bitch: pay checks and sympathy
Ha! but I guess it's just the pimp in me
All around paid, can't even get a sentence free
So judge a nigga sweetheart, sentence me
I ain't worried it's gon happen if it's meant to be
And if you ever feel the need to step inside
Be a woman about it and know we living seperate lives
Trying to tell you, less feelings mean less goodbyes
That's some game for your ass, better recognize
But some cats can't even relate
I ain't a mind reader though, so if you tryna escape
Then let me know that, show that
My place, roll back, lay down, so flat
Tell Me!
