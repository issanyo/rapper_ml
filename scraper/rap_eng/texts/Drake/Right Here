[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Baby, I'm here
I'm here to stay, I ain't going nowhere
I know you're scared cause you've been hurt
Baby, it's alright
Lost in your eyes every time that you look in mine
Promise to be all that you need
I won't leave you, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
No, cause I just wanna love you
I will never ever put nobody up above you
I just wanna kiss you, baby
I just wanna hug you 'til the end, baby, 'til the end

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Cause I'm right here, ain't nobody gotta hold ya
Cause I'm right here, ain't nobody gon' control ya
Cause I'm right right here, yeah yeah
I'm right here, I'm right here, I'm right here, I'm right here, yeah
I'm right here, I'm right here, yeah
I'm right here, I'm right here, yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Say you'll be mine, say we'll be fine, say we'll be together
Selfish of me to ask, since I be the reason we don't last forever
Wished that you knew all that I do to make this thing go right
Promise to be all that you need
I won't leave you, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
No, cause I just wanna love you
I will never ever put nobody up above you
I just wanna kiss you, baby
I just wanna hug you 'til the end, baby, 'til the end

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Cause I'm right here, ain't nobody gotta hold ya
Cause I'm right here, ain't nobody gon' control ya
Cause I'm right right here, yeah yeah
I'm right here, I'm right here, I'm right here, I'm right here, yeah
I'm right here, I'm right here, yeah
I'm right here, I'm right here, yeah

[Bridge: Drake & Justin Bieber]
And I say, good girl's got her mind right
She been raised right, being patient I know you waiting
Waiting on the good things when the time's right
You should let me get to know you, baby
But I just wanna put it on you, if you want to
Baby, tell me what you gon' do, girl
I can make you feel perfect, girl, you're worth it
I just need to see you work it, girl

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Cause I'm right here, ain't nobody gotta hold ya
Cause I'm right here, ain't nobody gon' control ya
Cause I'm right right here, yeah yeah
I'm right here, I'm right here, I'm right here, I'm right here, yeah
I'm right here, I'm right here, yeah
I'm right here, I'm right here, yeah

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
I'm right here, I'm right here, yeah yeah, woah
