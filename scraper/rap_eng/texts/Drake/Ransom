[Intro - Drake]
Yea, it's Drizzy baby
You already know who it is
It's the first time I'm high
It's the first time I smoked in like 3 months
I'm sorry mama, I had to do it to them
40 I see you
O, I see you homie
I stay late tonight right?
You know what happen when I stay late
Yea, Boi-1da!
I swear it's like this every single time
Toronto I got you
I got us

[Verse 1 - Drake]
I'm a hard guy to get along with, get on a song with
When shit be going right, well I just flip it to the wrong shit
The team that I belong to, the artists I put on with
Don't ever ask for nothing cause them niggas got their own shit
Me and Weezy are like a mouth full of hot peppers
Black Ferrari with the red seats, I call it "playing checkers"
I'm never doing verses, I'm forever giving lectures
If you trying to meet with money I'll be happy to connect ya
Life is better than it's ever been
Scheduling million-dollar meetings with the President
Someone cut the lights on! Where is Thomas Edison?
Got a a new condo, watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you trying to zone, I got a whole Swisher Sweet full
Rappers are liars and their women are deceitful
Add until they subtract me, I'll never be your equal
Last Place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me just write every single thing you need down
And he got it for me and I'm as happy can be now
Bout to start ballin' like I'm coming off a rebound
Yea, and I should have the most bragging rights
Because the nigga spit crack, bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they trying to get their swagger right
Cause I dunn came on more fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you pussy ass hater you should do you
You ain't heard of me then you should go and get a Blue's Clue?
Oops! I mean a red clue; Wayne's here, Soo-woo!
Bet he felt that like the end of a pool cue
But I ain't banging, I ain't waving no flag
I'm ATF but they ain't seeing no badge
It's Heartbreak Drake I hate to see him so sad
I can son you, see a little me in your dad
I'm the same yellow boy that used to play up on the Degrassi
Can pocket 20 thousand to be anywhere they ask me
Cash like Johnny, Banks like Ashley
Burnin' like a Camel Light; stupid ho, ash me
But don't ask me shit about me
And no the game really ain't shit without me
She might have to pay me but I dick her down free
Wanna know if it's the truth then pull the zipper down and see
No homo though

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Yea, um, I'm going in
Drizzy I got us, this is my promise
Ima bring that barrel to them bitches' eyeliners
And what I make up, would fuck up your skin
I pick the buck up and buck-buck then buck-buck again
I would butt-fuck your friend
Then suck up her twin, I put the buck-up to him
Then buck-buck and buck-buck and buck-buck again
Suck nut, you duck, fuck your unloving kin, now don't rub it in
Like Lubriderm on a new tattoo I had to
Kick my princess up out my castle
Dad, who? Never had that dude, always had a black tool
Even when I was at school, cause bullies aren't bullet-proof
Red scarf, hoody too, probably ain't as hood as you
Stupid motherfucker the only thing in the hood is you
I do everything good as you, no I do everything better
I get paid for every letter, A-B-C, et cetera
Fetch a bone. Like a dog motherfucker I am going for your neck
In a sec, intercept, bring it back like work in a trunk
And my exit coming up, yup I am headed to the buck like
Buck-buck again! Might fly to L.A and just fuck Karrine
Nahh fuck Karrine! Lets get bucks again, and fuckin' spend
Them bucks, and then, just fuck Karrine
If I told you I'mma do it, I did it
Got my city on my fitted, bout to pop it, let's get it
Lets get it motherfucker whatcha waitin on
It is bout a minute past pissed and I'm about to get shitted
I'm with it if money is the it you want me with
And I probly just spit on the chick you won't be with
And I hate a boney bitch only like em only thick
And I own hip-hop, if you don't spit I'm gon' evict
And I just sold a lot of property to a buyer
And I think his name was kinda like Drake Drizzy Rogers
Or Drizzy Drake Rogers I'm too busy to play father
And when it comes to the game I'm too willing to play harder
So harder I go, there he go
They chant MVP when I shoot a free throw
C.E.O., Jas what it do
The haters on their face and in their ass is a shoe
Faster than you, badder than you, radder than you, et cetera
I told ya, I get paid by the letter like
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y
ZZ Top, yes he rock
And me and Drizzy both wrote on Detox
That was just a foot note, how long can he could go
Wondering when he stop, bitch when the beat stop
So I'mma keep rockin' to the sheet rock bend
Then the heat I send burn skin, the end

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Young mula, baby, uhh
