[Drake]
Are you familiar with this feeling
No concealing
Its out all out in the open
The type of life you first timers could soak in
That virgin pussy's waiting
And Im about to poke it
Im underrated, I am Ricky Henderson to Oakland
But im about to sleep em, Acquire em', and keep em'
I require a retainer to retire them and sweep em' in a Dust pan
New guy, Too fly, who buy seven cars
Dubai seven stars
You die heaven's our's
And you don't see the jag drop in here
Its like im chasing my dad the way I tag pops in in here
Lets see how many carrots we can do
Mixin' farm land green with that paratrooper blue
Who are you? You confused homie, that's a pensive look there
Where those are dark oak floors and that expensive cookwear
Thats a 07 but I got a even newer ride
Doors all suicide
I should be your tour guide
Im expedia flown
Wikepidia known
Obtain a key to your home
And take a seat on your throne
I been through it all
Spend it all to do it all
You are not me man I could never be you at all
Cause you just stupid dog
The A8 super large
And yea you got a range but that shit ain't even supercharged

Aight check, flow switch, Flow switch

I don't ever pay a percentage of the retail
Only thing Im paying is attention to the detail
Schedule can change at the mention of a email
Booking up a show with some tension with a female
My Dad said to get rich you have to dig deep
Cause Drake these some big streets
And you are not Big Meech
And you are not Rayful
And this is not DC
Four years later quarter million off of TV
You was having hoop dreams
I was drafting group schemes
Take us off of bus kids and turn us into coupe teams
Well woop there it is
Oops now my troops clean
First car Audi drop, Color like a poutine
Im feelin grown up, Don't ask me for id, like you know who I be, bouncer I know the owner
I never go, I felt out of place at a school dance
Cause they know the layout of the mall like I knew france
Inside and out, Therefore I been Hiding out
And you drive cars that I been riding out
Correction I been rode em out
Been showin' out, sold off shit the stories you've been told about
And dog, I been old amount
Young money old accounts
Degrassi my royalties
Homie you just owed an once
No weight move
My shoulder counts
Man, I don't even know my name anymore man (laughs)
