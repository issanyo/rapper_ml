[Pre-Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I couldn't resist (I couldn't resist)
I mean look at that bitch
She looked at my wrist and she couldn’t resist
Back to back one, pop a bottle how could you resist
Pull up like Jordan
I'm ballin', whenever I shoot it goes swish

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Roller extension
I need no connections
I pay attention
But I do not pay for attention
Cause she know I got a check
I feel like a guardian
Like no one could stop me yeah
These bitches wanna bop me yeah
Champagne tsunami yeah

[Pre-Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I couldn't resist (I couldn't resist)
I mean look at that bitch
She looked at my wrist and she couldn’t resist
Back to back one, pop a bottle how could you resist

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Pull up like Jordan
I'm ballin', whenever I shoot it goes swish
Roll up another one
Pull me another one
I want another one
Every time that I take a shot I swear I never miss
I love it, I’m winnin', I’m feenin the game
Ain’t got no assists

[Bridge: PARTYNEXTDOOR](x2)
She pull up with gas now (swish)
I don’t even ask now (swish)
She countin' my cash now (swish)
Y'all niggas in last now (swish)

[Verse: Drake]
(These niggas be mad now)
You thought I would stay so complacent
But that shit was not on my next shit, ay na
Fuck it look [?] they hating
[Out to the wating I toss in their faces]
Already just knew that I got it, this
I need a monument for my accomplishments
[Banking accounts with my conglomerates]
I am not swayed by the consequence
Drop to the beat like i’m Yeezus
Won't waste my time or my money [?]
Forever I’m King and my bitch she be Queen
And she know I got D for her
Imma be me till I leave
Tell her hold that, this game gon cost some fee
Swishin’ I swish , what it’s like to be me
Swiping I swipe, mother fuck being cheap
I got kush in my wallet I'm zoned by the weed
Never gon stop and I put that on me
Conquered my craft now I’m stuck on repeat
I got to eat till my pockets obese

[Bridge: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
These niggas be mad now
(These niggas be mad when you make it (x2))
These bitches be mad now
(These bitches be mad when you make it(x2))
They full on that jealousy

[Pre-Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I couldn't resist (I couldn't resist)
I mean look at that bitch
She looked at my wrist and she couldn’t resist
Back to back one, pop a bottle how could you resist
Pull up like Jordan
I'm ballin', whenever I shoot it goes swish

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Roll up another one
Pull me another one
I want another one
Every time that I take a shot I swear I never miss
I love it, I’m winnin', I’m feenin the game
Ain’t got no assists

[Verse 3: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I’m on a whole different level
I need me a whole different bedroom
When you don’t got it boy how can you sell it
Always on go, my foot down on the pedal
Spending my money that shit just keep flowing
She popped her some pills now that bitch is just rolling
Roll up another one we just keep going
I hope that she ride me the same in the morning

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I couldn't resist (I couldn't resist)
I mean look at that bitch
She looked at my wrist and she couldn’t resist
Back to back one, pop a bottle how could you resist
Pull up like Jordan
I'm ballin', whenever I shoot it goes swish

[PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Roll up another one
Pull me another one
I want another one
Every time that I take a shot I swear I never miss
I love it, I’m winnin', I’m feenin the game
Ain’t got no assists
