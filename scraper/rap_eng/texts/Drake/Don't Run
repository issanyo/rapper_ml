[Verse 1]
Sent a message to my Instagram
You's a vegan but you going ham
Lotta niggas, lotta niggas
Lotta niggas wanna be like me
But you know the difference
You know it's different, baby
Yeah

[Bridge]
Only been with you for me
Let me know you're down
Let me know when you're downtown
Ring-a-ding, ding
Let me know if it's a ting
Out here with your Brampton tings
Fucking all your Pickering tings

[Chorus]
She said she wanna come to Toronto
She wanna come to the 6 side
She know that's the best side
Caribana, soca dancer, Machel Montano
Black red bandana, oh, a trip planner
She know who to check when she come around
She know who to check whenever she comes in town
She knows what I have to calm her down
She knows it's not something to run from now
Don't run, don't

[Verse 2]
Listen, all I wanna do is smoke with you
Sit down, have dinner with the folks with you
Touch road, hit Fringâ€™s then Bloke with you
Don't par with a broke boy, I'll do the most
Would you tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Since when are you all grown up
Since when do you know Mona
Since when do you not come home
I heard you got too much on your shoulders
Your mother just called my phone up
Sounds like your party is over

[Bridge]
Girl, you know I heard a lot of things, don't joke with me
Girl, you know I
And I know you're down, I know you're still down
Ring-a-ding, ding
Let me know if it's a ting
Out here with your Brampton ting
Fucking all your Pickering tings

[Chorus]
She said she wanna come to Toronto
She wanna come to the 6 side
She know that's the best side
Caribana, calypso dancer, Bajan accent
Blue yellow bandana, oh, trip planner
She know who to check when she come around
She know who to check whenever she comes in town
She knows what I have to calm her down
She knows it's not something to run from now
Don't run

[Outro]
Pace yourself, pace yourself, don't run baby
Don't run, baby
I know you're scared
Inception is everything you're wanting
Just trust me
I'll take it easy on you, babe
Just trust me, just trust me
Just trust me, just trust me
I'll make it easy
Just trust me, girl
I'll take it easy
