[Verse 1: Drake]

Okay I just got back from another label meeting and
I ain't what they looking for I ain't what they looking for
I ain't really Atlanta I ain't really Brooklyn or
I dont fit the appeal for them shows that they could book him for
Straight nigga tryna get in through a crooked door
Barely fittin in cuz a gimmicks what they took him for
But getting doubted caused me to reroute it
To another destination where the people they abouuut ittt!
You ever felt high above it all?
Run your fingers through the clouds like the sky about to fall?
Treat me like I'm rich when I'm about ball
And think once about the clothing that I buy up out the Mall
I'm famous so I get approached fast, Louie and Coach bags
All up in coach class, gem like Topaz, cool like slow Jazz
Dope like coke lines and crack like broke glass
I promise this is me, me

[Hook: Drake & Slakah The Beatchild]

I'm not supposed to do this
I'm supposed to be this nigga thats rapping bout gettin money
And you herd all of my songs so you know this shit wrong
Please do me a favor and keep it between me and you

[Bridge: Slakah The Beatchild]

You, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you

[Verse 2: Drake]

Yea
Ok, I'm floating in my zone without a scheduled descend
The rising and the fall was never my intent
I want this shit forever printed in cement
And if I ever sin I promise to repent
I'm only tryin to win I ain't tryna present
You gotta listen close like it's coming through the vent
These rappers can't see me I live behind the tint
And just to get a visual them niggas gotta squint
There I ammmm
Little me in row 23F real reconize real is there none of yall left?
Everybody in the game can't none of yall ref?
And filter out the bullshit the fuck is yall def?
You'r now tuned in to the new comer of this summer
The Chris Paul of this fall exist yall - Yea
And is the realist nigga still I?!
A bitch could love you to death and you still die
Ahhh!

[Hook: Drake & Slakah The Beatchild]

I'm not supposed to do this
I'm supposed to be this nigga thats rapping bout gettin money
And you herd all of my songs so you know this shit is wrong
Please do me a favor and keep it between me and you

[Bridge: Slakah The Beatchild]

You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
Just keep it between me and you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you

[Outro: Drake]
