You know that pain everyone keeps talking about?
(yeah)
I think I'm starting to feel it

[Relaxing beat]

And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

I go hard in the mu'fuckin' paint nigga
Leave you stankin' nigga
What the fuck you thinkin' nigga
I won't die for this shit
Or what the fuck I say (Brick Squad)
Front yard broad day wit da S.K. (ba ba ba ba ba ba bow)
See Gucci, that's my mothafuckin' nigga
I hang in the Dale wit' dem hit squad killers
Waka Flocka Flame one hood ass nigga
Ridin' real slow bendin' corners my nigga
