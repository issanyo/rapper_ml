[Hook: Mary J. Blige]

[Verse 3: Drake]
UH-OHHHHHH
Okay, I got these girls quite hype
Only thing on right now like a nightlight
While my brother Wayne rockin' out like a White Stripe
I'mma kill the game, I'm the Young Money white knight
Yeah, plus I'm lookin for the right type
Cautious of a flood so I always lay the right pipe
Wes put me on the marquee flight life
Plus I go hard for the woman that I might wife
I put the ring on her index finger
So if you wanna keep ya girl please don't bring her
I bet I'm the type of guy that she got a thing for
And you would block me, but this ain't Jenga
Yeah, and she's someone I would work with
That's what I can tell from what she's showin' on the surface
I ain't sayin I'm requestin' anyone that's perfect
But I just need a woman that'll make it all worth it

[Hook]
