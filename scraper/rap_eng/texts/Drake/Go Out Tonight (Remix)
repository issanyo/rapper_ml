[Verse 1: Drake]
You've been home for three whole days
Actin' like you got chores to do
Boy this house is way too clean
I don't think there's nothing more to do
Oh, you don't need that girl, she did it all wrong
You were still you before she ever came along
Get over it, get over it
I mean I understand the pain
Someone did me the same
I just put that nigga in his place then I got over it
Then I got over it and if you wanna know the truth

[Pre-Hook: Drake]
I think you should just get dressed and go out tonight
Go out tonight
Order you a drink, don't even overthink
Call a couple friends you know you can have some fun with
And go out tonight, go out tonight
Cause you might just meet me

[Hook: Drake]
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet me
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
I'm just lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet me

[Verse 2: Jay Novus]
They keep calling me names
But you don't mind
Say you don't need the fame
I'll leave it behind
Fresh from the shower but we still got dirty minds
That's right we can ride or we can we ride till the morning light

[Ian Thomas]
Your body is a blessing my baby, keep dancing my baby
You know that you own it my baby, you know you're my baby
Let me just help you out, we can figure it out
And get over it, you can get over it

[Pre-Hook: Drake & Jay Novus]
I think you should just get dressed and go out tonight
Go out tonight
Order you a drink, don't even overthink
Call a couple friends you know you can have some fun with
And go out tonight, go out tonight

[Hook: Drake]
Cause you might just meet me
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet me
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
I'm just lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet me
