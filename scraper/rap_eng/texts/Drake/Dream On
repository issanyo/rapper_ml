[Hook x4]
If you thinking I'mma quit before I die dream on
Fore' I die dream on
Fore' I die dream on
Fore' I die dream on

[Verse 1]
If you thinkin I’ma quit before I die dream on
I’m entering the arena gonna need a theme song
This one’s for the riding, chilling, leaning back driving slow
Steady head nodding, them easy e bullet flows
Bustin flows every day, rappin is a habit
And I’m Nickotine cause you need my flows like an addict
And I’m addicted to the pretty girls and the really nice rides
These people beall on my side like nationwide
Start crying my flows are getting meaner
If the chick is competition then I ain't even seen her
The fires in my eyes I’m a beast I’m an animal
And forget the lyrics man just rhyme it with a cannibal
That shows you how much a care about rapping
Cause I could put out a wack flow and you’d all be clapping
Haha that’s funny thinking id ever have a wack flow
These fake friends be like “Frankie I got your back bro”

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And what happens when the girl of your dreams is in your nightmares
Forget it I’m all about the buzz likelightyear
You’re all getting served and my verses are inedible
Being the next best thing is something that wasn’t preventable
So deal with it and try not to falter
My verses may be engaging but I’m showin you up at the alter
And playing this in reverse is the only way I get worse
Cause I as go forward I get better Leave you confused kellenheller
I’m so fresh cologne puts me on
And I’m the best abut I could be wrong
Haha no way my rhymes are so clever
Last name fail, First name never
And forever I bring endeavor, there’s no competition whatsoever
And every time I drop a rhyme they say “I thought he couldn’t get better”
I’ve got a crush on the fame, and I’mflirting with success
One day I’ll be the greatest until then I’ll be the best

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
If you think ima quit before I die then just shoot me
On my pursuit of happiness and I ain’ttalking the movie
And I ain't talked about getting high either
I’m running the rap game, I’ll never take a breather
These haters be sneezing they must be allergic to my achievements
It’s not my fault that they can’t believe it
But that’s just how it was and that’s just how it’ll be
