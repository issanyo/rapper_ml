[Verse:]
The clock that you've been watching has been stoppin
He makes you wait, what kind of man does that to a girl he wants
If you just give tonight to me I promise my hands will say

[Chorus:]
They'll say
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarms
Even though the traffic downtown don't show no mercy
Think about the last time I came through
I had something more than a gift for you
And I don't only fuck you like that on your birthday

Baby I just landed
Bout to get my bags and all I needs an address
And I'm on my way

Don't fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it's worth waiting for
Cuz I'm on my way (2x)
