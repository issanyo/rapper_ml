Every night its all the same

Poppin' bottles
Pullin' Models
Gettin' faded
I'm happy you noticed

Yeah, I'm stuntin on the move (but)
Sometimes I want a l-l-little conversation

I think it time for somebody to notice
That This life is overrated
Cuz I'm after something realer than
Than a good time gettin' faded

She just want someone to notice
That her hair and nails did it
For somebody to notice that she's bad, bad...

Money Money Money
I think it's kinda funny...

I use to want this thang forever
To the point of no surrender
All that money that I lent her
Could of my problems together

Abercrombie in these jeans
And My team is on this hoodie
Flow ugly like a rookie
But we call it Snookie (Ewww---)

That fortune or the fame
Just want you to know my name
Everything to stay the same
I want the passion and the pain

I sat, turned around back around like I'm panicked
DANK in this bitch
We just on another planet!!!

Got the flow now
What to roll now?
You don't really wanna go down
What you wanna know now
What you wanna know now
What they gon see
What they gon see
Cuz the game like a letter B

Let it be
What you wanna see
What you gone say
Cuz the people never say too much

The base is buggin, bumpin
Cuz I dont give a f***
I keep on goin
Goin
To the point I know I'm goin
On and on and on and
Ah Ah!

She wanted to go ham
Let it be or not to be
I'm happy you have noticed me

Justin: Money
Drake: I would miss it
Justin: Money, Money
Drake: Are you going down
Justin: Money, Money
Well fuck it lets get it then

[Justin Sticks]
Money up like an erection
Runner up like an election
Suggestin
Y'all just get like me
And my team would call that perfection

Got them diamonds
Rolled a pearl
Hittin stogies like my girl
Damn, her tongue would twirl n whirl
Twirl n Whirl just like her girl

Hah, my girls in love with Mary
Very Berry Popped her Cherry
Makes these Niggas look like fairies
Colder than that February

Amethyst
Got damn go ham
Outlandush shit
My Spanish bitch
Understand this shit
Rap It do my classy ho
Will damage it

Kush has got me bonkers
My mind is just far from farther
I'm so high up in the sky
That I think I'm getting smarter

Correct it let me no
All the money that we blow
I suppose
I'm getting high just to level out my lows

No No N N No No

This life is overrated
He's iritatin
My mind is racin
My mind is racing
On something I'm spacing
[JIBERISH]
I'm just super sayin
