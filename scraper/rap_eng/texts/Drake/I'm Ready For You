R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over, baby she's over
I've decided to give you all of me
Baby come closer, baby come closer
I'm ready for ya

Kill 'em all, switch it up
Put it on, zip it up
Let my perfume, soakin in your sweater
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better
No options for, you sayin no
I run this game, just play your role
Follow my lead, what you waitin fo'?
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night

[Interlude]
Ca-ha-han, you, fee-hee-heel, my, ha-ha-ha-ha-heart, is, beat-ing
Ca-ha-han, you, fee-hee-heel, my, ha-ha-ha-ha-heart, is, beat-ing

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah I hear you talkin, don't know who you tryin to flatter
Got my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I'm in control but with you bein a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin you're the man
Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya

[Drake]
Nothin on, I strut around
I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me
Mental pictures, no cameras please
[Interlude]

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah I hear you talkin, don't know who you tryin to flatter
Got my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I'm in control but with you bein a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin you're the man
Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya

[Drake]
Uhh, red lipstick on the wine glass, cameras in my mind flash
Black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass
You say you wanted fast? Define fast
Cause I could speed it up and make it lastAnd I could audition for this and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure that you never forget it, committed
I'm ready, I'm wit it, still here like a statue
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got baggage, well I'm packed tooPlus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you
Bang! The baddest woman ever in the heart of South
Proven over and over again, that's why I'm hard to doubt
Plus I'm Young Money 'til the death, I took the Carter route
I'm more than ready too, hope it's somethin that you thought about

[Interlude]

[Drake] I-I, I'm ready for ya
