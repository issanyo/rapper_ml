[Verse: Mars TY & Drake]
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

[Pre-Hook]
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

[Hook]
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home

[Bridge: Mars TY & Craker Boyyy x2]
You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby
