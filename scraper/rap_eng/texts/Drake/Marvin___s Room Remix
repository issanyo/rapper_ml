[Verse 1]
Club set of Roze
Boys in my old phone
I should call up one and go home
I’ve been in this club too long
The boy that I would try
Is happy with a good girl
But I’ve been drinking so much
That imma call him anyway and say

[Chorus]
Fuck that new girl
That you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that new girl
That you think you found
And you since you picked up, I know she’s not around
Oh, oh

I’m just saying you can do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I’m just saying you can do better
And I’ll start hating only if you make me

[Verse 2]
Club set of XO
All my people been here
I see all of his friends here
Guess he don’t have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What are you doing thats so important?
I’ve been drinking so much
That imma call him anyway and say

[Chorus]
Fuck that new girl
That you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that new girl
That you think you found
And you since you picked up, I know she’s not around
Oh, oh

I’m just saying you can do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I’m just saying you can do better
And I’ll start hating only if you make me

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

I’m just saying, I’m just saying, I’m just saying

I thought you’d come for me
I thought you’d run for me
Why didn’t you come for me?
Why did you leave?
I thought you’d come for me, I thought you’d come for me

Why didn’t you come for me?
Why did you leave me?
Oh

I was waiting
I’ve always been waiting
Why did you leave?
Oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Why would you leave me?)
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Why?)
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

I’m just saying you can do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
Too many drinks have been given to me
Why’d you leave me?

I’ll be waiting
And I’ll start hating only if you make me
Please don’t make me
Why didn’t you come for me?
Why?
Fuck that new girl
You know I’m your girl
