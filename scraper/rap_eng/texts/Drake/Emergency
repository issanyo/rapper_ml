Got a lady on the line
Screamin' 'bout what she need, oh
I done got this call a thousand times
I'm leaving, rushing to see, ooh

I got the sirens on
(I'm running every light)
She says she's home alone
(I'm needed in her life)
Until I get there girl
Stay on the line

It's an emergency
I'm rushing there to handle mine
It's an emergency
Cause we ain't got a lot of time

I gotta save her, if I'm any later
Somebody might get there before me
Emergency, that 911's for me
Emergency

When I got there, put her on the floor
She leakin' but she still breathin', ooh
Give her mouth to mouth a little more
Repeat it to show her I mean it, oh

I think I know what's wrong
(Lemme turn off all the lights)
She won't be here for long
(If I don't get this right)
Girl, I just can't lose you
So hold on, please

It's an emergency
I'm rushing there to handle mine
It's an emergency
Cause we ain't got a lot of time

I gotta save her, if I'm any later
Somebody might get there before me
Emergency, that 911's for me
Emergency

It's a good thing that you called me when you did
Cause you were slowly fading and wasn't gon' make it
I'm your doctor, see, these tools I'm working with?
I need to operate, I need you to be naked

I can feel your heartbeat, uh, uh, oh
Beatin' like it's so deep, uh, uh, oh
Give up on you never
I'll make it better

It's an emergency
I'm rushing there to handle mine
It's an emergency
Cause we ain't got a lot of time

I gotta save her, come any later
Somebody might get there before me
Emergency, that 911's for me
Emergency
