[Intro]
T. Slack, I promise I got 'em, homie!

[Verse 1]
I turn the phone off, I let the seat back
I'mma be out for a minute, I'll bring the heat back
The jet-setta and forever will I get chedda
And y'all will only get cash when you get betta
Check luggage, flow to a new city
Plus, the hoodie cover my eyes
I'm too pretty, nah, I'm just playin'
Heavy is how I weigh in
Top floor with a view of the water is what I stay in
But y'all don't hear me, yeah, y'all ain't relatin'
Well, let me tell you what happens when I be datin'
These chicks with ass fully skip they class
Catch me at the hotel and try and get they cash
But, I'm not stupid, nah -- I'm tight fisted
You tryna sex me for money is quite twisted
Prior to fall, I was lying to y'all
So if you gettin' one ring, I'm denyin' ya call

[Hook]
Let him breathe, let him live
Let him be, let him do it on his own
He a G, he just doing his thing
Gotta love that
Let him go, let him fall
Let him grow, if you feeling where he's at let him know
He just doing his thing
Gotta love that

[Verse 2]
Now my momma kinda iffy, My uncle kinda shifty
Expenses at this point have cost a little over fifty
The hummer and the range was in someone else's name
Hope my city's reputation for the summer's gonna change
I hope you stick around and see it
Cause if you ain't around I'll bring your chick around to see it
Until she catch feelings and I have to let her go
And when I park my car outside she'll stick around and key it
Repercussions of a cheap lash
Had me doing repaints, just to get em re-scratched
And get attached do insane things
Take new jewelry and put it down the drain things
But, that's just the drama that the fame brings
Fresh prince tryna touch sky like
Mr. Busy, Mr. Recieve the shipment
It's Mr. big dreams, no more than 2 months commitment

[Hook(2x)]
Let him breathe, let him live
Let him be, let him do it on his own
He a G, he just doin his thing
Gotta love that
Let him go, let him fall
Let him grow, if you feelin where he's at let him know
He just doin his thing
Gotta love that
