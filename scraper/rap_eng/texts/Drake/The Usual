Intro:
I wouldn't be me if I didn't get a little nasty
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na hey
They say all I talk about is sex

Verse (Trey Songz):
How 'bout we just pull over and do it where we at
How 'bout you just lift that skirt up, ooh we can be bad
That place that ain't been touched, I'm feelin on it
All that juicy fruit, keep spillin' on it
Girl, giddyup, get it up take me on a ride to extacy
You don't wanna pump pump then take a nap
You just wanna pump pump, bring it right back
Watch me (Watch me), Im'a heat it up beat it up

Hook:
Know you're tired of the usual, usual, usual
I can give you more than the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual, unusual, unusual
I'm not coming with the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon feel something unusual

Verse (Trey Songz):
I want to do the freaky things you never do
What if we did it while your friends was in the room
Is that too much for ya?
Don't you feel bad, let them see your sexy ass
We can make a sex room wherever we go
Take it to the restroom, they ain't got to know (no)
Watch me heat it up beat it up
Hey, do you hear me girl
Woah watch me heat it up beat it up

Hook:

Bridge:
Restaurants (check), Cinemas (check)
On the hood (check) of the car
Counter top (check), Balcony (check)
In the jet (check), On the beach (leggo)

Rap (Drake):
This that other shit, You know your asked for it
I might just send you some money to get your passport
So you can come to my city, I'll take you all over
And hit you on the balcony just don't fall over
Send me your picture baby you know I'll never leak it
I know you got something recent for someone decent
Why you laughin' out loud, I'm serious
Bring your girl if she's a little bi-curious
Please, please no story tellin' to others
I promise you gon' love it
I would never let you down
Feel like I might have perfected all the things that you expected
You gon know it when you bring your ass around

Hook:

Outro:
Do it all different ways or different places
Look at the many love faces your makin'
But can you take it

Yall thought I was nasty last time...Leggo
