Money, cars, clothes
The hoes, I suppose

[Hook - Trey Songz]
I want the money
Money and the cars
Cars and the clothes
The hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be
I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be
I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be
I just wanna be successful

[Verse 1 - Drake]
Drizzy
Ah yeah Trey I fuckin feel you
They be starin at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it
To me there's nothing realer
Just enough to solve your problems
Too much will kill ya
And when I leave I always come right back here
The young spitta that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all are still soundin like last year
The game needs change and I'm the mofucking cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush, shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious ya hate me
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD
Yeah, I want it all, that's why i strive for it
Dis me and you'll never hear a reply for it
Any awards show or party I get fly for it
I know that it's comin' i just hope that I'm alive for it

[Verse 2 - Drake]
Yeah
I want things to go my way
But as of late a lot of shit been goin sideways
And my mother tried to runaway from home
But I left somethin in the car, so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin wet she only 5'2
And 48 hours was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn. My reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin I neva have to fit in
So tryin to keep up with my progress is like a dead end
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show
And life change for us every single week so
It's good but I know this ain't the peak though
Cause I want...

[Verse 3 - Drake]
Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was tryin to put a ring on Alicia hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzin' like the pizza man
In person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treadin waters steady tryin to swim to shore
I'm on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store
Just call me "Shopping Bag Drizzy"
And call me "Mr. damn he ain't copin that is he?"
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy
While this young'n that you doubtin is about to get busy
Imma kill it I promise this I know you mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
To big homie use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't askin for much
All I want is the...

Yeah
Its like i know what i got to say
I just don't know how to say it to you

[Verse 4 - Lil' Wayne]
Uh
Pardon the swag, but bitches cartate
Long bread I don't eat shortcake
How come I can't
Miss a woman like I can't miss courtdates
Cheese, but she's not in this portrait
Yeah, life's fine but I don't portray
I'm on the other side, but it is a sharp gate
I don't want the glow, I want the glo'ray
And Imma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearing bullshit, bring on the cowshit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit
Now, that's word to Toronto
So high up I got birds in the condo
Ain't that a female dog
Ask her who I am to her, and she yell god
Weezy baby I go real hard
No further details boy
