[Verse 1]
Shit's all good
The deal got signed
And my split's all good
And these haters pretending
That it's all good
Say that shit in person
Man I wish ya'll would
I'm a mothafucking genius goddammit
I ain't the type to murder you
I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat
If you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket
And these rappers in a panic
But Belly told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me
Would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could of fooled me
And tell my city I'm the two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname started Drake
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other niggas is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen I could draw attention
But you can tell by my strut
I'm just chilling in the cut, nigga what
And I'm feeling like

[Refrain]
I get it, I get it, I get it till I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimping, if you planing on a visit
And they say that you talk em when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie

[Belly]
Here I go
Street report
Balling over here
We need three courts
Violence, you don't wanna resort
The house look something like a resort
You can't resist being rich when you record
When this money run slower than Eyore
If your life is a movie you an extra
I'm so fly, I glide Clyde Drexler
Mr. Pressure, bitch I'm fresher
They must heard that they'll never catch up
Somebody throw a sign to the catcher
I'm at the plate right now
Fuck next up

[Refrain]
I get it, I get it, I get it till I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimping, if you planing on a visit
And they say that you talk em when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
