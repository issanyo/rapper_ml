[Hook: Drake]
Too Many Times, I've been wrong, takes-takes too long
Too many times, I've been wrong, I'm done waiting
Too Many Times, I've been wrong, takes-takes too long
Too many times, I've been wrong, I'm done waiting
There's nothing left to do

[Verse 1: Kenan]
Angel in a black dress (yep)
It's backless
Diamonds on her necklace
Tonight was the night and I was on her checklist

She such a great actress...
When she say she love me

She a devil in disguise
But the truth just compromised

[and] I don't know who you are
I thought you were my star
I thought with you we'd go far

But we weren't secured
Wellsfargo
What about the trouble we endured
How deeep are m bars gonna go

Sweet smell of misery
Everyday was a mystery
I guess that-I guess that I couldn't see through your wizardry

[Hook: Drake]
Too Many Times, I've been wrong, takes-takes too long
Too many times, I've been wrong, I'm done waiting
Too Many Times, I've been wrong, takes-takes too long
Too many times, I've been wrong, I'm done waiting
There's nothing left to do
