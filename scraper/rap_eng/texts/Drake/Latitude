[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink polo's would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed, I felt like Bad Boy's street team
I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go
Take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talked to them
Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I would stand on line
I just wanted to dance
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance
I just wanted to shine
Jay's favorite line: "Dog, in due time"
Now he look at me, like "Damn, dog, you where I am"
A hip hop legend
I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven

[Chorus: Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make
Now ain't that about a bitch
That I'mma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, ffly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make

[Verse 2: Drake]
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
Cause I'm dripped up and I'm draped out
And I'm lean back
Scoping
Looking for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life
We go L-A, V-A
N-Y, T-O
Sunshine in that heat stroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin' at amazing'
Girls tryin' sell a whole lobby of us
Hear 'em all screaming then it's probably is
But I can't blame females, females can't really ignore something this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town
Two or three days I shut you down

[Chorus: Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make
Now ain't that about a bitch
That I'mma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, ffly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Guess who's on third?
Lupe still like Lupin the Third
Hear life here till I'm beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm trying to stop lying like a Mum-Ra
But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat
Engarde, Touch Lupe cool as the Unthawed
But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge
I come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car

[Chorus: Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make
Now ain't that about a bitch
That I'mma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, ffly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make
