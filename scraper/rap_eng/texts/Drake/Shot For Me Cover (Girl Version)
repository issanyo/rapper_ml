I can see it in your eyes your angry
Regret got shit on what your feeling now
Mad cause she ain't like me oh, your mad
Cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take all the love

That we made now your tryna find somebody
To replace what i gave to ya,its a shame
You didn't keep it, Dont need ya could
Care less and i know you gon hear this
Im the best yeah i said, Boy im the best

Dont you forget it, the way you walk
Thats me, the way you talk thats me
The way you get yo haircut, Did you
Forget thats me? And the voice in
Yo speaker right now thats me

Thats me can't you see, that i made it yeah i
Made first i made you who you are and then

Take a shot for me,oh, take a shot for me,oh
Take a shot for me,oh, okay look im honest
Boy i can't lie i miss you, you and the music
Were the only things that i commit to i
Never cheated for the record back when i was

With you, but you believe in everything but
Me boy i dont get you he said i know you
Changed, I never get to see you cause
Your always busy doing things, I really
Wish he had a different way of viewing

Things,I think the city that were from
Kinda ruined things,Its such a small
Place not much to do but talk and listen
These women are jealous and the men are all
In competition

And all your friends are telling you stories
That you often misinterpret, And taint all
Your images of you Mrs.perfect, I can tell
That you've been up all night, drinking all
Summer,praying for your happiness, hope

That you recover,And this the one i know
You hated when you heard it, But its worst
Cause you know that I deserve, Take a shot
For me,Oh, Take a shot for me,Oh, Take a
Shot for me,oh, take a shot for me,oh, take
A shot for me

Cause baby im the best,Baby im the best
Best you ever had,Best you ever had,Baby
Im the best,Baby im the best,Best you
Ever had,Best you ever had <3
