[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, it's Drake, KC

[Verse 1: Keshia Chanté]
We was just walking
Just smiling and talking
Then add to my surprise
Got lost in your eyes
This time they were different
And I found what it meant
After I leaned in I helplessly fell in

[Chorus: Keshia Chanté]
Help me I've fallen in love
And now I can't get up
Somewhere between your lips
Is where I think my heart slipped
I tried to catch myself
Not even I could have helped myself from falling
I think that I'm in love

[Verse 2: Keshia Chanté]
In love and I can't see
What's happening to me
You blinded my thoughts
From what pain and tears taught
See my hearts been broken before
It don't trust love anymore
One kiss from you
I just felt myself fall right through

[Chorus: Keshia Chanté]
Help me I've fallen in love
And now I can't get up
Somewhere between your lips
Is where I think my heart slipped
I tried to catch myself
Not even I could have helped myself from falling
I think that I'm in love

[Verse 3: Keshia Chanté]
Got me hypnotized with your magic spell
I got butterflies, can't control myself
Close my eyes at night and I dream of you
It's true, don't know what to do

[Bridge: Keshia Chanté & Drake]
Don't stop now
Since I let you in
You showed me how
You showed me how to love again
And there's no reason why
I can't give you a try (you know what it is)
'Cause it feels so right

[Verse 4: Drake]
Look, previously mischievous behavior
Was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some considerable degree
Steppin' out the house
Tryin' to figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
But ugh, Keshia, Keshia do you remember the old us?
We would never be together, is what they told us
From immature kids to entrepreneur kids
We bought our own dreams instead of the ones they sold us
Keep it a hundred, what they sayin' I'm a liar for?
Airing laundry, that's what I got a dryer for
What are they even searching through attire for?
Tellin' you these stories bout lonely women that I ignore
Callin' them out is red rover to me
To them it's a dream, its just a rare rover to me
See I'm passionate and focused
I don't know how they expect a Scorpio born in October to be, but ugh

[Alternate Verse: Drake]
I'm going in, check
Look, previously mischievous behavior was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house
Tryin' to figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
But now, I need a culprit
I am talking lofts and beach condo adult shit
I am talking all day shopping sprees at the mall with, friends that I ball with, here meet T's girl, go and get some fall shit
Sweetie I am a tracks demise. I will kill this song until it actually dies
With a military jacket and some pack supplies
I won't say I'm the best until the stats arrive
And all these A-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside, its only slacks and ties
But you dont ever act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy until the plaques arrives
Thats why I love you

[Chorus: Keshia Chanté]
I've fallen please help me
