[Verse 1: Skepta]
Yeah, roadman, roadman, roadman what these niggas smokin'?
Tattoos on my skin means I ain't fuckin' jokin'
Dem boys tweetin' visions, dem boys up to somethin'
Smokin' with the Jumpman out in Paris, it was bait
You can't smoke with me cause you got something on your face
I hit that Ginobili with my right hand on my waist
Talkin' to a top boy, look a top boy in the face
Go uptown to Dyckman, I got peng tings on my case
Roadman, roadman, roadman, I flew out the country
Where was you when I was in the gully?
Oh now you see the vision, now you want some money?
Tryna send me e-mails, I just forward them to grace
Tracksuit Mafia, we get the star from outer space
Wasteman, wasteman, wasteman, you copy and paste
Topboy, topboy, smokin' jetpack in the eights
Charlie Sheen I'm winnin', never come in second place

[Verse 2: Future]
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman
I just seen the jet take off, they up to something
