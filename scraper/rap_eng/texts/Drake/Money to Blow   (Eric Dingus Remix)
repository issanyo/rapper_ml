[Verse 1: Drake]
24-hour champagne diet
Spilling while I'm sipping, I encourage you to try it
I'm probably just saying that cause I don't have to buy it
The club owner supply it, boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
That fly sh*t
That fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
That fly sh*t
That fly sh*t

[Hook: Drake]
I got money to blow
I'm getting it in
Letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blow
I'm getting it in
Letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blow, oh, I got money to blow, oh

[Verse 2: Drake]
I-I'm on my Disney sh*t - Goofy flow
On records I'm Captain Hook and my new car is "Rufio"
Damn, where my roof just go? I'm somebody that you should know
Get to shaking something cause that's what Drumma produced it for
Yes I make mistakes that I don't ever make excuses for
Like leaving girls that love me and constantly seducing hoes
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
That fly sh*t
That fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
That fly sh*t
That fly sh*t

[Hook: Drake]
I got money to blow
I'm getting it in
Letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blow
I'm getting it in
Letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blow, oh, I got money to blow, oh
