[Verse 1]
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

[Chorus]
Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home

[Outro]
Just hold on, just hold on
We're going home, we're going home
Just hold on, just hold on
We're going home, we're going home
I know exactly who you could be
