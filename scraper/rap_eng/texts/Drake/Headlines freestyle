Verse 1

Why do u even try this shit, why do I even give a fuck, I gotta lot of confidence and I don't try to suck, it's the rap game nigga, u laying like a boba fett, nigga I've set the dice, but I'll have to pay the price
I'll just get out the cross
Yeah I believe in that
I would never punch a chick
Just to get to that
I'm the one who never snitched
Yeah I'm a guy like that
All u do is snitch and bitch
I don't believe in that
I eat all the food off the plate, cuz Im eating like that
But u won't cuz I'm the best
All u do is cry like that
Oh,oh, don't do it, please don't do it
I abuse my power, so please don't kill me,Blake got the money, so Blake gonna pay it, those all my niggas, so I don't even need  to say it cuz they know. I'm done

Just the first verse
