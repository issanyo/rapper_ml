* bonus song off of Comeback Season

[Verse One] [Drake]
Check (Nottz, Nottz, Nottz)
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
Alright so
I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ice so
What is about to unfold
No tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though
I ain't about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Ben's rice throw
That is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world
Got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby

[Hook]
Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

[Verse Two] [Drake]
Since you came into college, Hill is somethin you still TiVo
Then you switched the vibe and listened to Il Divo
Or maybe D.M.P., A Tribe Called Quest
But when you call too much then I call less
You would always complain about my small texts
But what you call conversation, I call stress
And that put a barrier between both of our carriers
And I would be like �I ain't getting service in your area�
You be like �Nigga get your bars up�
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong
I think that this is fate
You took out those extensions and lost you a little weight
Your booty lookin bigger and I think that shit is great
A fresh start is in order, let me take you on a date
Take you on a date
I used to think you used to play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby! (look)

[Hook]
Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around
