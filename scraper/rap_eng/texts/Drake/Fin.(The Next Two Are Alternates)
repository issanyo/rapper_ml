Well... I've realized that I'm not a killer... but... somebody's gotta go...
*chuckles lightheartedly*

My hands are shaking...
My heart is racing....
Faster than lightning flashes
Similar scenery as stan's the screen's panning
Im in the left lane on that same freeway...
Nervous as hell... my beard's looking like freeway's
Cuz I know this day...might be my last day....
Scared as ever I'm guilty got past mistakes
Cuz if I don't make it to heaven yo I'm trapped for good
Well for bad... haha guess my humor still good......
So here I am begging God for forgiveness..
Hoping he has mercy sorry this is last minute
Yo I'm at my last minute.....
Am I really ready to end it?
Seeing bright life flashes fading back to the beginning...
Baby steps adult living
Kindergarten college chilling
Aaliyah I gave it all and you better know I meant it....

I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready
(Echo: I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready
(Echo: I'm ready, I'm ready)
