[Verse 1: Sean Garrett]
Junior high, played'em
High school, played'em
College, well, you know, played'em
Me and my friends used to laugh about it, how we fade'em
Now cupid’s aiming his arrow right there at me
No more nonchalance can I be, with you here starring at me
With the most beautiful eyes that a nigga ever seen
You pull an emotional vibe from my soul, look at me
You got my heart beating like my back is filled with batteries

[Hook: Sean Garrett]
For the first time I’m in love
And I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody (what im feeling)
For the first time I feel love
And I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody

Drizzy... Drake

[Verse 2: Drake]
All them men before me did shit I would never do
And I know you got your guards up, but they should let him through
Just keep fightin' for our lovin' baby, I'll defend it too
And if they try and tell me time is money I'd spend it with you
I spend it all
I spend it all
I charge forever, to my card
And pay it off, no interest lost
I be right here, and like your favorite wine girl
I'm worth trying, but take it easy on me
Cuz this my first time


[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sean Garrett]
I ain’t never looked into a woman’s eye worth of fire
Bet I’m feelin while you holdin’ me begging to take you higher
For so long I wasn’t faded, I couldn’t admitted before
But now I see what life’s about, and i’m never goin’ let you go
Girl I’m growin’ don’t wanna be selfish, I wanna be more accountable
I see us growing don’t wanna miss out on a feeling I never had before
I got to tell the world, somebody gotta know
What you’da done to me, I gotta let’em know
