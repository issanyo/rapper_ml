[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I’m so fuckin dumb I wear diamonds on my thumbs
There’s a diamond on my dick so there’s a diamond on her tongue
I can’t feel you baby cause I'm romantically numb
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come
There’s nothing under God's sun that I haven’t done
I got a lot of problems, getting pussy just isn’t one
Girls are like buses every 15 min they run
Now they like potato chips I just can’t have one
And I might like you for a minute
But I don’t like your friends in my business
And I feel like you don’t deserve a visit
Cause you ain’t in the kitchen when you want a whipping

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, uh ahhhh
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking boo boo but we just don’t believe you

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, ok I’m all about it, all for it
I’m all star team Jordan, small forward
I’m never putting up a shot unless it calls for it
No hesitation so I’m shooting if I draw for it
Pow, Pow, fuck is up, naw man I’m in this ho
Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all these minutes go
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show
Now I get a hundred what the fuck you think I’m in it for
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jay and Mack agree
Fuck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me
Shout out to your girlfriend nigga lately she distracting me
Wondering if I’m the best, Well-I-am, no Black Eyed Peas
Girls wanna fuck you, niggas gotta wanna be you
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to
So you can say whatever girl but we just don’t believe you

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, uh ahhhh
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking boo boo but we just don’t believe you

[Verse 3: Sean Garrett]
Ain’t that your girl
Ain’t that your money
Ain’t you the same nigga that say she want you that you funny
Ain’t you a gangsta, yeah funny
You gave em funny, gave you to you, fucking dummy
Classic line, bitches run like buses
Gucci say niggas asking why, why you with my girl
She let me get it nigga
She ain’t stupid, go turn up your radio
I’m the next young Lionel Richie
I gives a fuck about doing a fucking cameo
We don’ love em, we don’ love em, we don’ love em, NO!
They just love us, they just love us, cos we stack them O’s
Cos we whip it, watch her whip it when she whip it all
Thats gon hit, once they mention catching feelings two word don’t go

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, uh ahhhh
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking boo boo but we just don’t believe you
