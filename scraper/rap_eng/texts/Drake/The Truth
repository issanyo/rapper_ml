[Chorus: sample of Drake]
Uh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin’ hard in his yellow goose
Uh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin’ hard in his yellow goose

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
Yeah, I write rhymes from the finish to the start I’m dyslexic
They trying figure who I’m sitting in this Lex with
Uh, the click move wit discretion
Feds trying a build a case and find his connections
So the courts can have him in municipal
Anything you say can and will be admissible
Rap niggas throwing shots inadvertently
The word death, not scared of it’s uncertainty
Niggas dissing then they say it unintentional
Nothing that they ever seen, rhymes unconventional
Not many can fuck with me lyrically
And I say that unequivocally
Rap fans be over analytical
God made the world, no man should be identical
Then tell me why these rappers be imitating
Fuck subliminals, what are you insinuating?

[Chorus: sample of Drake]
Uh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin’ hard in his yellow goose
Uh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin’ hard in his yellow goose

[Verse 2: Fredro Starr]
Yo, ayo, the beats by Audible Doc, nothing less is unethical
My Brooklyn flow is impeccable
Uh, in other words audacious
My genetics is made of all races
That’s why the minds advancing
Future and the time keep the rhymes enhancing
These rappers got some audacity
New York, you can’t fuck with that city
My shooters is uncontrollable
Sometimes they make family members inconsolable
They say I got Crypt affiliations
Dicks wanna to tie a nigga up in litigations
Not trying sounds too pretentious
Dealing with this industry you gotta be relentless
I wanna lift ’em up and lead them out depression
They wanna lock me up and take my freedom of expression

[Chorus: sample of Drake]
Uh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin’ hard in his yellow goose
Uh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin’ hard in his yellow goose
Uh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin’ hard in his yellow goose
Uh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin’ hard in his yellow goose
