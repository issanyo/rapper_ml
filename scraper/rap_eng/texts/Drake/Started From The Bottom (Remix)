[Intro: Riff Raff]
Still sellin' drugs, I came through, still fuckin' with them thugs
Still sippin' drank, still sippin', bored now, I come -

[Hook 1: Riff Raff]
When my back's against the grain, money ain't a thang
Stackin' all this change got me flyin' private planes
Still sippin' drank, still sippin' drank...
Still sippin' drank, I'm still sippin' drank...
I'm still pullin' stars
Fuck around and I'm 'bout to pull Mars down
Pull it out the sky, 'sace on my eye
Oklahoma tie

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Popped up sober, Jody Highroller
Back in high school had a chip in front of my shoulder
But it's 2k13, still chasin' dreams
Done everything, got some diamonds on my rings
Range Rover aqua, break you off proper
Chop the block like a lobster, it's the freestyle doctor
Losin' ain't an option, haters can't stand me
I done broke a brick down on stage at the Grammys
Spilled syrup on my Dockers, break you off proper
Graduated hardwood degree, a martial artist
Hands-free phone, yep, I'm on my cordless
Neon boss, used to slang drugs
Fuckin' with them thugs got me not givin' a fuck
Versace shoulder shrug
Smokin' all these blunts got me buying new lungs

[Hook 1: Riff Raff]

[Hook 2: Drake]
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here

[Verse 2: Drake]
I done kept it real from the jump
Living at my mama's house we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was trying to get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like, "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys, told ya bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think its funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show and we...

[Hook 2: Drake]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it, nigga
I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here that's popping off without us, nigga
We just want the credit where it's due
I'mma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house cause we...

[Hook 2: Drake]

[Bridge: Drake]
No new niggas, nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stays the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stay the same through the money and the fame cause we...
