Boy Wonder
And C-O-S-S-O-M

[Chorus] - Kevin Cossom
I get money, I get paper
I get girls, all different flavors
I buy Gucci, I buy Prada
I spend dollar after dollar [x2]

[VERSE] - Drake
Y'all don't really like me
I can understand
My flow is sittin' right inside the pocket of my pants
I'm still fly, you can't float
Run this sh*t, Usain Bolt
I write your favorite records
All of you seein' ghosts
Twenty-thousand for a verse is our routine quote
I'm gettin' rich, all of you stayin' broke
Chillin' even if I'm in a goose-down coat
I can't see you through the Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch when you throw me high fives
They try to measure up
But there is no one my size
Whatever Forty smokin' 'bout to lower my eyes
Beast mode on 'em
I never take a night off
Every single thing a n***a purchase is a write-off
Grounded as the runway pavement
I'm takin' flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off
('Cause he's about to go in)

[Chorus] - Kevin Cossom

[VERSE] - Kevin Cossom
And I'm the rookie of the year
I'm 'bout to get my dough on
I'm about to take off
Baby you should hold on
But I ain't about to prolong

I'ma keep it short
And tell you what's about to go on
Bottle after bottle
'Cause the money's, like, so long
Biggest movie ever
We about to put a show on
I'ma show off, like I'm supposed to
You can get lost, I don't know you

[VERSE] - Drake
I hear my phone ringin' when you call
I ain't pickin' up or entertainin' them at all
Got your girl face down, bangin' on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall
Hmm, hmm, hmm, I cannot relate
Ridin' with some tags that I got from out of state
Ridin' with a swag that I got from outer space
Just show me who's the hottest
I'ma knock him out his place
Call me "Homicide Drizzy"
I'm 'bout to kill your ego
I'm about my green, puffin' goody like I'm Cee-Lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While a Houston stripper pole-dances in the zero
Fantasy to you, reality to me
And, yeah, my G-Pass is as valid as can be
I'm so fresh, the stylist would agree
Wavin' at your girl while she's smilin' back at me

[Chorus] - Kevin Cossom
[FADE] - Kevin Cossom

Louie, too
Yeah, and Alexander McQueen
I'm so clean, so mean
It's K.C. and Drizzy
And it's the remix, remix
C-O-S-S-O-M
