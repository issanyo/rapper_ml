[Intro: Jay Z]
We gotta sell these bitches the dream, my nigga
Niggas like Walt Disney around this bitch

[Verse 1: Brayo]
What you know bout me
What you know bout be
Don't you know what a nigga done seen
What you know, dont you know i flipped trees
While my niggas flipped keys, so my nigga please
Don't remind me
What you know, what you know bout pain
What you know bout strength
Don't you know that a nigga ain't playing
Don't you know, don't you know that a nigga got bills
So im out here chasing mills, so you should know a nigga gota strain
My nigga i just moved to miami
Tryna feed my tummy
Yeah these bitches are yummy
But im just chasing this money
They say its riches and bitches
And beaches and pictures
But in miami its just goons tryna get your attention
Man a nigga been starving, like a motherfuckin slave
Man this shit is retarded, but i gota be brave
Don't you know i gota save my fam from that shit
Make sure they all gota eat, my nigga
What you know bout a nigga named B.R.A to the fuckin Y.O
My nigga, don't you know i was raised in the slums of fuckin nairo lil nigga


Don't you know that im star
Your boy done come so far
All the way from nairo to the 305 just to give yall some bars
You better know who we are, lil nigga better know who we are
Up in the club in the vip while you other lil niggas are stuck by the bar

[Hook: Timbaland]
What you know bout me, what you know bout me
What you know bout me, what you know bout me
Not a muthafuckin thing, not a muthafuckin thing
Not a muthafuckin thing, not a muthafuckin thing

[Verse 2: Drake]
I just got back home, 40 days on vacation
No one killing the game, shit is all for the taking
What the fuck did I stutter? am I being mistaken?
I'm a s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-star in the makin'
Who you said was the man? What the fuck is a deal
Really do it the best, I'm DJ Khaled for real
Got my thumb on the pulse, got impeccable timin'
If they forgot about my worth, I got a check to remind 'em
Got some things on the wrist, Cartier with the diamonds
If this was 10 years ago nigga would've went diamond
I been singing and rapping I make a killin' in both
If i had to choose a Jackson man I'm feelin' like Bo
Fresh down to the socks, team look like the Raiders
I don't take this shit for granted, I'd like to thank my creator
I'm coming b-b-b-b-b-b-b-back on you haters
I'm 'bout to put this bitch on her back and get back to you later
Man, whats up

[Hook: Timbaland]

[verse 3: Brayo]
Ah, not a mother fuckin thing
Let me try and keep it plain
So you know what im saying
Bout this money im slaying
Any nigga in my way
Man a nigga don't play
Smoke your ass and leave your ash in the ash tray
Just a fuckin jk
I ain't no fuckin killer but when times get realer ima pull that trigger
Yeah they call me kiriba yeah i keep me a diva and a nigga got stripes
I ain't talking addidas i am talking bout a zebra or a fuckin referee
Take a hit of the refer b
I said maybe more like a zebra or a fuckin referee
Take a hit of the refer b lil nika
