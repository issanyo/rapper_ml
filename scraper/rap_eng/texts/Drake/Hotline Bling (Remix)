[Verse 1]
I was in a dark place when I met you
You brought me out of it, now I'm back to bitchin'
Used to want all the money, now it's back to hitch-hiking
So bitch quit fighting, you ain't shit girl
Look at me then look at you
You were cheating on me
Now I'm your ex to see, now you're dating a dude
Over XBOX see? It's over the sea probably
This the oddessy, I body the modesty
Shotty to choppity, floppy shit I do see
What you all talk about, so I'm changin' want I was to see
What in the fuck I could have be, now I'm gonna be

So comfortable that you all wanna know

[Verse 2]
You see I liked you, I wanted you
But I realized that you had a mustache
That you didn't want to shave
You could only ever go one way
So now it's one way and a done deal
So I run away, it's done, you're a seal
Not a marines type but a floppy one in the water
Bitch you need some new morals
I don't see why your hair was an issue
Did you just sneeze bitch atchoo, here's a tissue for you
Your hair was all coraled up bitch
And I hope you don't like this, I hope you cry to this
Please somebody stop me from turnin' to John Malkovich
I'm a bitch, I know but I wasn't pushed
Into a ditch because of my clit like you

[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over for a dude
Lookin' at your phone, wishin' you had a nude
Bitch quit being rude, I know you need somebody in your life
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching choad
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone, yeah, yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're fucking guys and
