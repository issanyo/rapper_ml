[VERSE 1]
Man, you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
And love, I don't mind feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
I'm in the fresh and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
I'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before I'll grab that for ya like holding a door
Cause mines it Polo and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like

[VERSE 2]
You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would

[Hook]
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You been a bad girl

[BRIDGE]
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Someone's gonna have to
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you

[VERSE 3]
You can call me professor
But baby you broke the rules
You won't get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
So you can work it off
Baby I can give you extra credit
But there's something else
Girl can I frisk you?
Search you body for
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
Its cause your hiding ?
And I'm going to sentence you
Baby you can do your time on me

[Hook]
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You been a bad girl

[BRIDGE]
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Someone's gonna have to
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you

[OUTRO]
Just for the moment
For tonight
Can I make you mine?
Is it me, is it us?
Can I love you all of my life?
