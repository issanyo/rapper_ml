[Verse:Drake]
Ayye Yo DJ Wristpect let's get em'
Veterans like "How dare all of this arrogance"
What you expect when all they do is draw comparisons between us and Americans
And tell me go hard well I'm going harder now
Bumpin Shawn Carter cause there ain't a Shawn Carter now, feel me
Get with it, I'm trying to overthrow a nation using fade to black as a nigga's only motivation
I'm picking and choosing an army and thinking of moving my talent is proven
A show of hands who's in?
And if you must know, this year I'm going for the gusto plus though seat feeling like a bus load
So take me as I am  have nada of me the red stripe on my jacket show you that Prada love me
I'm a threat in a city of no legends imagine that a whole Sistine with no brethrens
No blood glide gunshots identity this you a rapper homie leave that for Trinity Chris word
See my role models roll with models and switch gold bottles holding more dough than the whole lotto
So while you clowns making toasts in a cheap bar the whole ATF make mimosas with the clicquot
What up Nikko, Jordan, Lucky and TJ nicknamed the Night Fox clique we take it easy
You Prime Ministers claim you repping the T, I need a Motherfucking president to represent me nigga
