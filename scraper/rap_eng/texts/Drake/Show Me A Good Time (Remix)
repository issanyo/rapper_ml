[Hook: Drake]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right, now that I'm here, baby
Show me a good time

[Verse 1: Einstein]
I live for the moments that I will remember
With the people that I might forget
Depending on big-headed I become
And depending on how stubborn and hype I get
I live for the life that I want right now, now, now
But sadly now doesn't come that quick
And I just hate how, how, how
Changing way too hard to fix
I'ma star to pick my cars and whips
And I ain't even made it that far to begin
I go hard for the win but my heart is thin
So failure to me is where I start to quit
So when I start to finish my ego tripping just ends up missing
How can you show me a good time when I ain't even there to begin with

[Verse 2]
How about you and all your morals in that outfit that you borrowed?
Make the most out of tonight, and worry bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl, can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne, presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
People really hate it when a backpack rapper get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do it if they could: it's in our nature
Young and rich and out of control out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground though, so I'mma spend another 10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because anyway you put it, bitch, I made it Yup!
