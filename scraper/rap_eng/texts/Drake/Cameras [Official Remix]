[Verse 1: Ke'Ondris]
Before they knew who i was tha preety girls had a problem
With me but tha ugly girls always wanted to holla
But i couldn't settle for less so i threw tha
Light skinned girls a couple dollas
Now she my bestfrind and my brand new girlfriend
She only wanna talk 2 me
But only on camera
Only on camera

She say they in love with me
Only on camera
Only on camera
Only on camera
Im Stuck without ah move im

Gotta figure out something to remove ya
From my life cus you fucking my shyt up
And now you living tha single life

[Verse 2: Peter Ray Rivers]
From tha botton of my heart I mean every word that i say
Say you dont care

Looking for some dumb muphuka's

[Verse 3: Drake]
How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
You just know what you get told girl I see behind the scene
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gonna have to get it cleaned
She been going way to hard, someone has to intervene
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining armor all tires
Girl, they love me like I'm Prince, like the new kid with the crown
Bunch of underground kings, thought you knew how we get down (ah)

[Bridge]
