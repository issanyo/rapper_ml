[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, shit's all good
The deal got signed, and my split's all good
And these haters pretending that it's all good
Say that shit in person man, I wish y'all would
I'm a motherfuckin' genius, goddammit
I ain't the type to murder you, I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat if you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic
But Belly told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I've changed, then the slightest could have fooled me
Yeah, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname's "Starter Drake"
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other niggas is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen, I could draw attention
But you could tell by my strut
I'm just chillin' in the cut, nigga what, and I'm feelin' like

[Chorus: Drake & Belly]
I get it, I get it, I get it 'til I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimpin' if you plannin' on a visit
And they say that you can talk it when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie (Drake)
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie

[Verse 2: Belly]
Here I go, street reaper
Ballin' over here, we need three courts
Violence, you don't wanna resort
The house looks something like a resort
You can't resist bein' rich when you record
When this money runs slower than Eeyore
If your life is a movie, you a extra
I'm so fly, I glide: Clyde Drexler (wooh)
Mister pressure, bitch I'm fresher
They must heard that they'll never catch up
Somebody throw a sign to the catcher
I'm at the plate right now, fuck next up

[Chorus: Drake & Belly]
I get it, I get it, I get it 'til I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimpin' if you plannin' on a visit
And they say that you can talk it when you live it
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
