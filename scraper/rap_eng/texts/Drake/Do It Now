[Intro]
Uh, yeah, alright
Uh, well alright
Yeah, well alright
Uh huh, yeah
Feel good

[Verse 1]
It's a celebration, clap-clap, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscato
For the girl who's a student and her friend who's a model
Finished the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this
Yeah, and he was just practice
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl ya on fire can I be the one you match with
I give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where ya tats is
Show me where ya hands at, maybe I can grasp it
They say if ya get her you can understand her better
And she known to be a cheater but that's only if you let her
Yeah, and I got it together
So when they talk they try deter me it's like whatever
Tell em' I appreciate the help but I just gotta know for myself

[Verse 2]
This lifestyle is foul this shit'll damage ya
Especially when you think noone is understanding ya
These girl groups with they overprotective managers
Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin they cam-er-a
Snap snap snap until they runnin outta card space
You remind me of Tony's sister in scarface
Just take it easy on love and slow ya heart rate
Goodness gracious on top is such a hard place
Yea... but if you never even been there
You kinda make sense why you dying of pretendin
Spillin all ya drinks takin pictures in ya swimwear
Head up in the clouds you survivin on the thin air
I know that shit is exhausting girl
And your mistakes are costing girl
And maybe you don't need the help but I just wanna see for myself
