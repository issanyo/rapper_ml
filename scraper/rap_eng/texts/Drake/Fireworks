Verse 1 - M.Y. Tha Vizion
It came up ones and it came up twice
My past in my face she looking real nice
She invited me over to house one night
Gave me the number and said don't leave me lonely
I love you baby you my one and my only
We had a good time don't you remember
I keep you warm in heart of December
Know you treating my love like splitter
Mike you know you doing me wrong, baby
I said hold on move on lady
I'm new man so don't try sweet talk
Trust you can't never be my sweetheart
I got eyes for the King and you not him
Cause I seen what you did to likes of them
You gave em dreams that was filled the hurt
Cause fire came and burnt there works, lady

Chorus - Drake & Alicia Keys

Verse 2 - M.Y. Tha Vizion
I said to myself I gonna move slow
Cause I'm tired of all the tough talk minimal growth
I she came up talking the present
An she was like baby come on be real
You can't live your life planted in His field
Think of the past she asked so she sincere
You got fears and you don't know the outcome
You seen what to Martin and Malcolm
I see what you sayin' but listen little mama
Change won't come even if you're Obama
I trusted in myself and all I got was pain
Like trusted in the past and all I got was shame
The past and present all yall the same
So trust in the Lord as I call on his name
I'll pray for you past cause you living in a dream
Cause I'm living in the presence of my God El lo hem

Chorus - Drake & Alicia Keys
