[Hook: Drake]
Every night it's all the same
Poppin' bottles for them bitches, gettin' faded
I'm happy you noticed
Houston numbers but sometimes﻿ I want a little conversation
I think its time for somebody to notice
That this life is overrated cause I'm meant
For something realer than a good time getting faded
She just wanted someone to notice that her hair
Nails did and for somebody to notice that she bad

[Verse 1: Celeb Forever]
I haven't seen you in forever its been ages
You ain't aged a bit
Still the same woman you was back in 06' damn swag
Still so cold, we so throwed, how you been?
I've been fine, how's your son? He two years old
Damn I feel old
I'm rockin' this gold she rockin' that white rollie
This bitch so tight Only here for the night
Where you been all my life? I need you to show me
She with golds and poppin' this ice
Damn well I'm a goldie wait They gon' hate
That's how it go that's how you know you killin' em'
And fuck these hoes, I say baby ooh, look at'chu
Louis Vuitton, Jimmy Choo, get em boo
Louie V, Cool with me, girl do you
It's just me and Sean McGee up in Loumans
Going crazy buying bottles like new parents, cool
One, two, three and to the four, girl I want you
To break these bitches off
Break em' off with ya hot ass, girl that's Dragon Tales
You got it go ahead brag it girl you bad
And where them bitches, over there swear they wack as hell

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Celeb Forever]
Stunnin' on these boys, seem like me ain't got no choice
See your bitch I bet she rolls When I pull up in that Royce
Did a show last night at (?) and I just got back my voice
And that's good cause she swear that's what use to make her pussy moist
Well her body It's to crowded V.I.P. look like the floor
And we just ran out of bottles, could ya'll please bring us some more?
You know ballers bring the models so theres bitches thank the lord
Put that on my mama, you the hottest bitch in it for sure
Ooh we've done that, we've done that, that shit feel all the same
Sick of waking up with women that I do not know they name
And she sick of being forgotten after it come out as Kate
So that's why I went I got her when I saw her body stay
Be like one, two, three and to the four, girl I want you
To break these bitches off
Break em' off with ya beautiful self
Babe you look perfect, I don't see nothin' you can do that with help
So don't you worry
You bad

[Hook]

[Bridge x2: Drake]
And for somebody to notice

[Outro: Drake]
Poppin' bottles for them bitches, gettin' faded
