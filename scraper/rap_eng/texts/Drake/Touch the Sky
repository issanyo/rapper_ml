Drizzy, we here, we in the buildin

Lay go...

Drake

Who else really tryna fuck with Hollywood shows
I’m with Marley G ho
Fly hardly grown chicks to my hardly good shows
And I wanna tell you suttin that you brolly don’t know
Dis that warthog millionaire collar bread flow n uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ma real friends take a hearing from me, fake friends turn a cold shoulder when they listen to me
But I don’t walk with you’s, I got heads in crews
I got my dick purple, from all these sexy boo’s
You gotta talk fast, if you want my love
But if you not talkin, you can catch a slug
See I been around, now I’m at the top
And all these sexy bitches, callin me hot and top
Caught a plane out, and fell asleep on it, so now I’m dreamin of bein fly
But I ain’t the nigga doping on the other guys

O-Rock

Just bought my niggas some cane, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumpin’ the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I’m forgiven for carin’ ’bout how they livin’
And loanin’ a little money and keepin’ ‘em out of prison
I ain’t lyin’ in my verses I’m just telling you the basics
Of growin’ up with your friends and becoming the one that made it, Yes lord!
All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talkin’ bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worry ’bout your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin’ like our collars up
And good ain’t good enough, and your hood ain’t hood enough
Spend my whole life putting on, you spend your whole life putting up
Ain’t no telling when I go, so there ain’t shit that I’mma wait for
I’m the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for
