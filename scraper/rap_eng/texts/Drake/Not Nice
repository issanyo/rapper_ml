[Intro: Drake]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Drake]
You've got some vacation time
You and your girlfriend too badmind
Bad, bad, bad, when you're both combined
I don't get how you look so nice

[Chorus: Drake]
Girl, you're not nice, you're rude
Want me to feel like I'm new
Want me to watch you do you
Don't, girl, you look so nice
But you're not nice, you're rude (so rude)
Look what you're putting me through
I'd never do this to you

[Refrain: Drake]
I need to hold the corner and then slow whine it
One time, yeah
I need to hold the corner (corner) and then slow whine it
One time, yeah

[Sample: Vybz Kartel]
You a real bad gyal weh nuh tek back chat
And anything yuh say yuh can defend that
You a real bad gyal weh nuh tek back chat
And anything yuh say yuh can defend that too

[Verse 2: Drake]
Right now we're just taking time
Other things are on your mind
And you want bad, bad, bad when I treat you right
I don't care how you look so nice

[Chorus: Drake]
Girl, you're not nice, you're rude
Want me to feel like I'm new
Want me to watch you do you
Don't, girl, you look so nice
But you're not nice, you're rude (so rude)
Look what you're putting me through
I'd never do this to you

[Refrain: Drake]
I need to hold the corner and then slow whine it
One time, yeah
I need to hold the corner and then slow whine it
One time, yeah

[Sample: Vybz Kartel]
You a real bad gyal weh nuh tek back chat
And anything yuh say yuh can defend that
You a real bad gyal weh nuh tek back chat
And anything yuh say yuh can defend that too

[Bridge: Drake]
I need to hold the corner
I need to, I need to, I need to, I need to

[Refrain: Drake]
I need to hold the corner and then slow whine it
One time, yeah
I need to hold the corner (corner) and then slow whine it
One time, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
'Cause, girl, you're not nice, you're rude
Want me to feel like I'm new
Want me to watch you do you
Don't, girl, you look so nice
But you're not nice, you're rude (so rude)
Look what you're putting me through
I'd never do this to you
