[Verse 1: Mark Foster]
Bless my heart, bless my soul
Didn't think i'd make it to 22 years old
There must be someone up above
Sayin'  "Come on, Brittany, you got to come on up"

[Chorus: Mark Foster, Luke Pritchard]
You got to hold on
Yeah, you got to hold on, yeah

[Verse 2: Luke Pritchard]
So bless my heart and bless yours too
I don't know where i'm gonna go
Don't know what i'm gonna do
There must be somebody up above
Sayin' "Come on, come on , you got to come on up"

[Chorus: Mark Foster, Luke Pritchard]
You got to hold on
You got to hold on

[Bridge 1: Luke Pritchard, Mark Foster]
Yeah! you got to wait!
Yeah! you got to wait!
But i don't wanna wait

[Verse 3: Mark Foster, Luke Pritchard & both]
So, bless my heart, bless my mind!
I got so much to do, but i ain't got much time
Must be someone up above
Sayin' "Come on, girl
Yeah, you got to.."

[Chorus: Mark Foster, Luke Pritchard]
Hold on
Yeah, you got to hold on
You got to hold on
You got to hold on

[Bridge 2: Luke Pritchard]
Uhhh!, uhhh!, you gotta wait!
Yeah!, you got to wait!
Yeah!, you got to wait!
Yeah!, you got to wait!
Yeah!, you got to wait!
