Yes
I'm on that old switch lane shit
Jay, Biggs, Dane shit
Talking about them niggas that my daddy pitch came with
Cause I never learned the "biz" i learned the language
Well spoken, Man i should've went to Cambriege
And momma would always claim this:
"I never expected the outcome"
But one day I became this
Famous
No longer nameless
More gain
But Im the same
I will remain this
I'm still focused
I stay grounded
You see I ran with a style when they clowned it
So read 48 laws if you never read it
Cuz that is one of the main reasons I'm level headed
Despite the accumalated success
If my attitude that was straight I made a regress
I never want to win the lottery only because my uncle told me
"He who made it by struggling, made it the best"
So with that on my chest
I'm down on my last 12 G's

Going through my closet thinking:
"I should probably sell these"
Chanel C's, and LV's
Somebody stop before I really start to rebel please
I spend it all
Who needs anymore?
Who's satisfied doing good deeds anymore?
Who grieves anymore?
Who believes anymore?
Who graduated school and still reads anymore?
Not me
That should have my whole race shook
Cause we don't read novels
But we do face book
The new craze is having that new age look
If I said I liked it I'd feel like a 2 faced crook
Nah
I tell retro kids:
"Tie that bandana just a little bit tighter til it suficates you biter"
Cuz i dont wear bright colors or rope chains
I'm a G my daddy was in the dope game
