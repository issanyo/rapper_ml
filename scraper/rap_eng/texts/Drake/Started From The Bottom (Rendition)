Riding round in this big old truck, bitch I'm from Texas
Shawty bad she don't give a fuck, no need to stress it
Living life like I knew I would, ain't even flexin'
Labels call but I'm doing good, said you hear that blamin'
A million dollar chain, fuck that million dollar game
I won't stop till I'm in the top dirty and the thirty careless about the fame
I think it's time for me to stand out
Don't wanna hand out, just wanna make the music pop to it then jam out

So bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'ma ball to the day I fall, ball ball ball
Oh yes my bitches love me
Ohhh, yeah yeah ohhh, yeah yeah
I can give a fuck bout no hater as long as my bitches love me
Ohhh, yeah yeah ohhh, yeah yeah

Like a tap-tap just bring it back on'na my lap..
If you wanna come back to my lap
I can show you everything like I sing and I rap fast...
Word up,whats on your mind word up
Baby girl you're fine, word up

The girls come, the world comes too I like this spot
