[Verse 1: Drake]
This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do you're used to it
And I hate hearing stories 'bout who you've been with
That's when I gotta hide, what I'm feeling inside

So you still think I'm confident and damn
Is this gonna last? You're up on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask

Is anything I'm doing brand new
Brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new
Brand new, brand new, brand new, oh

This here is something personal
Highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside

So I don't ever question you and damn
I can't even find the perfect brush
So I can paint what's going through my mind
Racing against myself but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask

Is anything I'm doing brand new
Brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new
Brand new, brand new, brand new, oh

Is anything I'm doing brand new
No, no, no, no, no
Is everything I'm doing too late
Late, late, late, late

Did he take off your clothes off just like this
Did he give you loving just like this
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date
Tell me, baby, am I too late

Is anything I'm doing brand new
Brand new, brand new
Show me if this is brand new
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
