[Chorus]
Yeah, I said you my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you, that's a bold move
I know that you're out here and it's things you gotta go through
Just know that Tha 3, it don't love you like I do, and it never will

[Verse 1]
Yea it never will
For you? Im forever real
You could tell me everything that you got locked away, girl i'd never tell
Its confidential, l'll keep it to myself
And I swear, that's a swear
Right hand to the big man
Slim chance of me tellin' like a stick man
Girl, on life that's the truth
I'll do anything you want me to

[Chorus]
Cause you my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you, that's a bold move
I know that you're out here and it's things you gotta go through
Just know that Tha 3, it don't love you like I do, and it never will

[Verse 2]
Can tell me what's the drill
Is everything on you real?
I'm talkin' hair and them nails
Breasts and that derriere
Cause if it is that ain't fair
Other women can't compare baby
I wanna netflix & chill
And i meanin' that forreal
So what's up with that what's up
You the sickest like you stuffed up
I hate you're cuffed up
If i get you, i den lucked up
You got my interest
Baby girl for you i got time and inches
We talk like you ain't gotta man, we got dementia
Also I forgot to mention

[Chorus]
Baby girl, you my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you, that's a bold move
I know that you're out here and it's things you gotta go through
Just know that Tha 3, it don't love you like I do, and it never will

[Verse 3]
Yeah it never will, it will never
You know the game, no one plays it better
You never compromise or go below your standards
You independent baby girl you got it all together
See you ain't perfect but you close
Walk by in a dress and they necks on broke
You can be big as Rihanna you bad as Rihanna
I know I said that before but it's still true
Yeah baby girl you're a star to me, you're art to me
I swear I want you all to me
Make my hotline bling, make a call to me
So I can tell you what you are to me

[Chorus]
You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you, that's a bold move
I know that you're out here and it's things you gotta go through
Just know that Tha 3, it don't love you like I do, and it never will
