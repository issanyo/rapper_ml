[Drake]
Alright, well alright
I say I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I’m in ya starting five you will never need a sub
And I’m neva looking down so I always know wassup
A picture won't do me Justice League in this bitch
I’ma do me trust this
Patience little label nigga you won't rush this
I got the hammer money sweetie you can’t touch this
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario
Coming through ya stereo
Plus my girlfriend booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don’t cry for me this ain’t motha fucking Mario
Yeah, and Polow isn’t at my session
Mr Anticipation Ima keep you niggas guessing like

[Hook]
Ok ok I’m grown, Im grown
Party at my house but I’m home alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn’t condone
Counting everything I own in my muthaf-cking ZONE

I’m up too high somebody come get me down down down down
Said I’m up too high somebody get me down down down down

[Drake - Verse 2]
Look, my ex girl said she done dating black guys
She shoulda listened when her white friends advised
Not me I make your battle ships capsize
Get soaked get wet get baptized
I got the full package a nigga complete
I get bread and eat tracks like lunch meat
Sue me and Ima put you on front street
Probably get your records pushed back like front seats
I’m much more then you fathom he would be
And ain't too many niggas that I’d rather be than me
I guarantee the women getting at him would agree
That he should go ahead and put a patent on his g
And I swear these niggas gassed up even though the price is high
I could own half as much clothing and be twice as fly
You know my coupe sit super low
Top slipped off like Janet at the superbowl

[Hook]
Ok ok I’m grown, Im grown
Party at my house but I’m home alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn’t condone
Counting everything I own in my muthaf-cking ZONE
[End]
