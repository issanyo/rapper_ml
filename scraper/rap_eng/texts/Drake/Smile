[Hook: Voyce]
I see you sitting at home
Nobody's calling you on the phone
Your girls out making a night on the town while you're sitting there all alone
I suggest you come with your crew
Y'all are looking for something to do
Cause I understand pain is love and that's exactly why I wrote this little something for you
It's for you, it's for you, it's for you, for you (Repeat x2)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ladies up north represent representing
Ladies down south represent representing
When the mic is in my hand I'm never hesitant
My favorite jam back in the day was Eric B For President, it's evident
She spend her summers in Jamaica and I love that
They say that she should be a model she's above that
She had a rapper break her heart, had to open her
So she don't even mess with rap, only spoken word
Well, I'm a poet so you know it's get her to going down
And after all this is my city I could show you round
I understand that the shit you facing is crazy
Let me hear your views on the situations in Haiti
Or sit back relax, vibe with ya man
Chill we could talk about Tribes in Sudan
Cause you gotta understand if I said it then I meant it
I understand that you Afro I'm tryna get to your centric
That's why I got a bottle of Champagne and then I sent it
Over where you sitting, noticed, pretend you didn't
Along with the bottle was a note attached
Here's some tickets to my show you should go to that
And it's a shame money's something that you barely need to knock her
I'm tryna treat her right cause she barely treated proper
But you showed up regardless of late choices it's clear
You really came to kick it it with Drake, Voyce and Amir like

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Voyce]
Cause love (Love is in the air)
You know that love is in the air (You see that girl over there, I'm tryna make her smile you know what I mean, we gonna try and make a video later)
I should feel it everywhere
So smile (She fly, I think I see her friend over there too, you know what I mean)
So smile for me one time and I guarantee we gon have a good time (Cause ever since rewind we get full of girls like this man, it's just not even a thing...so uh)
Cause love (Hey girl won't you come here, I got a suggestion you know what I mean)
So smile (Why don't you and your friends, Get with me and my friends, maybe we could be friends you know what I mean, we could do this every weekend...maybe love is in it's self know what I mean, uh)
