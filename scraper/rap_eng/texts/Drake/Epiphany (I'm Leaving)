[Intro:]
Yep...
Uh Huh
And then it comes to me, like an epiphany
(It's over, over
Yeah, It's over, over)

[Verse 1:]
Second night in a row
You didn't come home
I'm watching my phone
Waiting for it to ring (ring, ring)
Sitting in the house
On the couch with the TV on
All night, all alone
Every time, same old thing

[Chorus:]
So I think I'm just about over being your girlfriend (girlfriend)
I'm leaving (leaving), I'm leaving
No more wondering what you've been doing
Where you been sleeping
(It's over) I'm leaving
(It's over) I'm leaving
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2:]
So you walked in
The next morning
To find me smiling
Like nothing ever happened
You give me some excuse
Like you always do
I just kiss your cheek
And this is
What I tell you (you, you)

[Chorus:]
So I think I'm just about over being your girlfriend (girlfriend)
I'm leaving (leaving), I'm leaving
No more wondering what you've been doing
Where you been sleeping
(It's over) I'm leaving
(It's over) I'm leaving
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge:]
How many times did
I fall for your lies?
How many times
Did I sit home and cry
Never questioning why, why
It just came to me
Like an epiphany
"How about if I just leave?"

[Chorus:]
So I think I'm just about over being your girlfriend (girlfriend)
I'm leaving (leaving), I'm leaving
No more wondering what you've been doing
Where you been sleeping
(It's over) I'm leaving
(It's over) I'm leaving
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
