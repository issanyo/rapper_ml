[Verse 1: Drake]
Look... I know girls love Beyoncé, girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing and shawty you ain’t no different
These days it’s hard to meet women, feel like my love life is finished
I’ve been avoiding commitment that's why I’m in this position
I’m scared to let somebody in on this, +No New Friends+, no no no
You know how this shit go, you got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it’s just me, but I am not alone
But if you’re alone then, say my name, say my name

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say, “Baby, I love you”
If you ain’t running games, say my name, say my name
You actin’ kinda shady, baby, why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

[Verse 2: Wiley]
Look, I know girls love Rihanna, girls love to play with your mindset
Girls always find out the business, and baby you ain't no different
I think I've met a few women, who know the meaning of winning
So I'mma take on
And leave here, cause girl we don't have to be here
I'm 'bout to let somebody
In on this, old friend, she is new friends
She knows me from way back when I
Know she knows my ways
The way I was from way back then, these people won't believe the years
We've spent before as friends, now we're together she can say

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, uh... Say my name, say my name, cause those other men are practice
And this ain’t no time for actin’, and this ain’t no time for games
And this ain’t no time for uncertainty, and this ain’t no time for locking your phone
And not coming home and startin’ some shit when I’m in the zone
This is why I’ve been saying, "no new friends, no no no"
You know how this shit goes, this is not four years ago
Time escapes me, now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys ‘round me saying, “Get money and fuck these hoes”
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I’m just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that’ll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with cause we don’t wanna hide no more
Plus you’re not shy no more; neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I’m not alone, even though +Nothing Was The Same+
Let me get your ass alone, let me make you say my name, say my name

[Hook]
