(Saukrates intro)
They say we killin' 'em all, all, all, all

[Verse 1: Drake]
Hip hop's newest and youngest acquisition
If this was you, I wonder what you'd do in that position
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference
Try to make 'em play your shit or try to make 'em listen
I go from records with Dwele and L.B. and Elzhi
The meetings where they tell me to start making records and that They'll buy
Now I'm out in A-Town
They tellin' me Trey sound
It's too mainstream if I plan on me stickin' around
But the allure of this year's Scream Tour has been cuttin' all them Jawns that be hurtin' the game
I be dreamin' 'bout hoes and doin' them live shows
Shirtless, that's why I started to personal train
Dog, personally mane
I'm a person that came to bring purpose to a seem unless they purposeless game
It never feel like it's earned when you purchase the fame
Now my thoughts gettin' deeper and I'm searchin' the game
I keep on, on, on, on, on

[Drake & Saukrates: Hook]
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all
I'm killin' 'em all, all

[Verse 2: Saukrates]
Yeah
Let me show you how to blast up
Now tell me who is a masta
A mind never wasted
Who grows fasta?
The young and incredible while lightin' yo' ass up
You look a lil' red, we gettin' that cash up
See where we from, the 50's are bloody
And the 100 dollar bill is dirty brown, they love me
I mess up my livin' room, and studio with my money
A G-note is purple, grape juice stains on the front piece of
My lapel, is custom made
You off the rack shit
I'm off the chain, come on
The dogs are loose
And yeah we get our dumb on like San Frisco Bay
With 40 and Mac Dre
Eat it or forever lose a piece of your meal to me or one of my folk
Drake'll give you the deal
If bein' broke at 30 is a nigga that kills
I guess we somethin' like two ice bergs huntin' to kill
Keep on, keep on (Uh), keep on (Uh), keep on (Uh)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Look, uh
I used to get 'em like murda murda
Ol' time killin'
I wasn't even rappin', spent my whole time chillin'
And now the girls like
It's only Drake got chased and so the artists I respected try and Take my place
But pimpin' ain't easy man and neither is rappin'
They one in the same when you need it to happen
My city full of players they just needed a captain
In need of him right now in need of him back then
But back then I was actin'
Nowadays I serve backhands with backspin
Tryin' to prove rappers are intelligent black men
And  now whoever chose to back out is back in
They say there's two sides to every story and three when the truth Get told
So grab a spoon 'fore your soup get cold
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old
So please discover an answer 'fore proof gets sold
And keep on, on, on, on, on

[Hook]
