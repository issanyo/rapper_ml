Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
She invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
No tellin', ain't no tellin'

[Verse 1]
Mixtape, I been working on this mixtape
Nigga if you been sleeping on me, that's a mistake
Just think, I been doing this since 6th grade
Back when all my Jay-Z covers only got like 6 plays
Did that satire shit and got on Renegade with J
Got on Rap Genius, then I did them verses with Sway
Now everybody telling me that all my shit's great
I'm like thanks but I think that ya'll a bit late
Aye, but at least now they seeing me
You officially listening to V.E.N.D
When it comes to MP3s, I'm the MVP
Nah it's all about me, I'm the TimVP
Man, I'm just rapping for respect, you know I gotta get it
Flexing on the track just like a nigga ate a lot of spinach
Did you get that last line? Man ya'll prolly didn't
Ya'll niggas still ain't get like half the lines in no competition, nah

No tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
No tellin', ain't no tellin'

[Verse 2]
Okay I had to switch the
Flow up on you niggas, shit was getting to predictable
Painting a picture with these words, the flow is visible
And if that is the case, then these ain't verses, they visuals
Now picture this, I'm not tryna get all deep and visceral
And you might find these theory to be completely dismissible
But how can you follow a crowd and be an individual?
That's oxymoronic, like the homeless performing rituals
It don't add up, so you niggas will never get the sum
If you can't see this star in the making, you'll never get the sun
If you can't see this war that I'm waging, then it's already won
Ya'll never been inspiring, believe me, this shit's already done
I just named 4 Crash songs, and you ain't even know it
All these niggas tryna save the game, they tryna be heroic
I'm just proving that ya boy can spit, and that you need to know it
But after this song, I don't really think that I need to show it, nah

[Verse]
They told me all of my lyrics are never ever fly
They told that I suck and that I should never try
They said "Virtual Entertainment Never Dies
All the songs are free cause it's shit that no one would ever buy"
Whole time I was like, okay whatever guys
All that negative bullshit, I set aside
Cause it turns out that them niggas were never right
Cause this verse is so much better than anything they'll ever write
If you a pest to me then consider this verse some pesticide
If they say that I'm wack, it's just some lies, I'm the best alive
Anyone wanna come prove me wrong? Then I suggest you try
Anyone wanna come at me wrong? Then I suggest you hide
With this tape, you know it's safe to say the best has just arrived
I bet you guys get petrified every time that I testify
The best is I, and it's about time I start getting recognized
When I meet Mr. West some time, that's when two of the best collide
I really hate to be this guy
But I think I'd rather be seen alive, than sing a lie
Nowadays, the real nigga get penalized
If they not rapping 'bout trapping more than a venus fly
You know I really hate to be this guy
But who says the limit has to be the sky?
That's a mentality that should be despised
Cause I'm out of this world, so that saying should really be revised
My talent will never be disguised, so you can't be surprised
If you niggas still can't see my rise, get some eagle eyes
Fuck how horribly this entire mixtape is equalized
I'm not tryna get on the radio, I'm tryna Ether guys
D.E.A.D. Entertainment, we on top, and you can't beat the guys
The clique is Susan Storm-Richards, you can't even see the guys
Rolling with the cheese and the dough, like the pizza guys
Came to give the game a spark, I'm feeling like I'm Lisa, guys
I'm going in, but I gotta save, I got 7 tracks left
Will them bitches be any good? Ain't no tellin'
Mixed this whole fucking thing by myself
Will these verses sound like they should? Ain't no tellin'
Police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, but we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'

[Outro]
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
No tellin', ain't no tellin'
No tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
No tellin', ain't no tellin'
Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
No tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
