[Chorus: Lloyd]
I-I-I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock girl
I-I-I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock

[Verse 1: Lloyd]
I can beat it up like an ultimate fighter
I can eat it up like a Siberian tiger
I can heat it up like Miami in the summer
I wanna ride you out for Yokahama
Your body baby
Is shaped like my guitar
I wanna tune it up and play it all night
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Cause she wanna Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh do baby

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
She got that good good
She Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, For her attractive ass
And now we murderers, Because we kill time
I knock her lights out, And she still shines
I hate to see her go, But I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth like a soccer team
Cold as a winter day, hot as a summers eve
Young Money thieves, steal your heart with ease

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh baby I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flinstone I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock girl
I-I-I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock

[Verse 3: Lloyd]
In the bed girl me be trouble
I can make your body rock me no rubble
So holla back when you see me you heard I tear that pussy up me and young jeezy it's gettin late
We can see the sun come over to my house & play on my drums brum bum bum bum give the drummer some girl here the drummer come

[Verse 4: Drake]
I Love Ya Sushi Rolls, Hotter Than Wasabi
I'm Race'n For Your Love
Shake And Bake Ricky Bobby
I'm At The W, But I Can't Meet You In The Lobby
Girl I Gotta Watch My Back, Cause I'm Not Just Anybody
I Seen Em' Stand In Line, Just To Get Beside Her
I Let Her See The Aston, And Let The Rest Surprise Her
That's When We Disappear, You Need GPS To Find Her
Oh That Was Your Girl?
I Thought I Recognized Her

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh baby I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flinstone I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock girl
I-I-I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock

[Lloyd:]
Fast cars and pretty women got a lot in common I'm speedin in em' [x2]

Me no rubble

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh baby I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the key spot
Call me Mr. Flinstone I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock girl
I-I-I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock

[Outro: Lloyd]
Me no rubble
It's Young Goldie Baby [x2]
