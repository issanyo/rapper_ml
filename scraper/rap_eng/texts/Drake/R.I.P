R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over, baby she's over
I decided to give you all of me
Baby come closer, baby come closer

Sexy senorita, I feel your aura
Jump out that new motor
Get in my flying saucer
I'll make you call me daddy
Even though you ain't my daughter
Baby I ain't talking books
When I say that I can take you across the borders
I'm young and free, I'm London G
I'm tongue in cheek
So baby give me some time to drink
Slow and steady for me
Go on like a jezzy for me
And say the words soon as you're ready for me

I'm ready for ya
Hit 'em all, switch it up
Put 'em on, zip it up
Let my perfume, soak into your sweater
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better
No option for, you saying no
I run this game, just play a role
Follow my lead, what you waiting for?
Thought it over and decided tonight is your night

Ca-a-an you fe-e-el my He-he-he-he-heart is beatin'
Ca-a-an you fe-e-el my He-he-he-he-heart is beatin'

R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over, baby she's over
(I-I-I'm ready for ya)
I decided to give you all of me
Baby come closer, baby come closer
(I-I-I'm ready for ya)

Nothing on, I strut around
I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me
Mental pictures, no cameras please

Ca-a-an you fe-e-el my He-he-he-he-heart is beatin'
Ca-a-an you fe-e-el my He-he-he-he-heart is beatin'

R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over, baby she's over
(I-I-I'm ready for ya)
I decided to give you all of me
Baby come closer, baby come closer
(I, I, I'm ready for ya)

Yeah I hear you talking
Don't know who you trying to flatter
Got my mind made up (I, I, I'm ready for ya)
I'm in control, but with you being a man
You don't seem to understand (I, I, I'm ready for ya)
I, I, I'm ready for ya
I, I, I'm ready for ya
So keep thinking you the man
Cause it's all part of my plan
I, I, I'm ready for ya

Ca-a-an you fe-e-el my He-he-he-he-heart is beatin'
Ca-a-an you fe-e-el my He-he-he-he-heart is beatin'

R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over...
