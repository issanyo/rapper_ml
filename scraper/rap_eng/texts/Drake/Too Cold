(Hook x3)
Anything they do, we do it better
TSP too cold, go grab a sweater x3
Grab a swear go go go grab a sweater
TSP too cold, go grab a sweater


(Verse 1)
We supply the drugs, I'm a pharmacist
I set fire to the booth, I'm an arsonist
Catch me slipping on the street, you know I never slip
I'm in the studio cooking up a hella shit
We made unexpected changes like the weather did
We were chilling now we're winning and we did it quick
TSP's too cold and that's the truth and we only get hot when we flame up the booth
Studio time I went and melted my tooth, I'm better than couple grown man and I'm a youte
Little boy better sit back, I'll push something in your six pac
When I ride around with my clique ahk, A body fall if a push that
I'll suck a man for his lunch pack, I tell him keep quite man don't chat
Drama, niggas don't want drama fuckboys had it harder than Osama
I put a blade to your head like a barber

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
Your chick sucked my dick, but thats none of my business
She's a ho ho ho I ain't even talking about christmas
Tee killed the beat so Ima bury it somebody grab me a coffin
Yeah the mics in the booth and i'm burning it, the smokes got me coughing
Fake rappers don't hear that, fuck a don I done it bareback
These olders youts think they scare man, fuck boy dont vex me
I'll fly kick you no Jet Lee, Tell your bitch to stop texting me
No bitch you can't flex with me, I said no bitch you can't flex with me
Pussy boy don't want drama, I'm moving crops like a farmer
I'm setting pace in this rap ting my niggas 1hunna
I still your flow and make it better, my mood changes like the weather
All your niggas are lightweight i'll make them fall like a feather

(Verse 3)
All my set pace man stay OJ, see my shank make noise know I don't play
All the girls used to think I'm OK, got your girl on my dick she moany
I'm stuck at my yard still active, with a pad and a pen finding tactics
You was dumb on the roads still lacking, While this chick on my dick she unattractive
Can't do it like me, me and you don't compare
Big ting on me, so you better not stare
Peng ting on me, she got the long hair
Go on her knees, and she answers my prayers
They say i'm aware, and broski showing big moves being done so prepare

(Hook)
