You put your trust in everything but you can't trust me
There's certain things I'm doing but you never seem happy
You seem better off and I don't blame you
Everybody's needing you and I can't tame you
I wish I could take it back, wish you take you back
But it's fine man, you put us in your past, man
I just hope you truly happy
I just hope you'll be happy
