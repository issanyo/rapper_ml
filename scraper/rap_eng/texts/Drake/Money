[Hook]
I take time to make that (Money)
Some breakdowns get caked back (Money)
Flip eight times, get eight stacks (Money)
You can not get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's no need to stash right (Money)
Same four G's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from me

[Verse 1]
Hey yo I'm movin' on up, excuse a moi, pardon it's me
There's a new chapter to life that I'm starting to see
And I'ma make and spend money to the hardest degree
And on the low I probably mimic every artist I see
I need a house, a wifey, a nice watch and a lot of cake
I can't lie, there's certain figures I gotta make
And for my family, this a shot that I gotta take
Cause where I live there's nobody as hot as Drake
Which basically means, who's faith in his team
Will resort to new cars, briefcases with cream
Tryna find a space in the jeans for placing the green
And a watch get they attention, the bracelet's clean
I'm stayin' the music, wifey kinda need to be a band lover
I keep it flow, an old school like your grandmother
I'm a tan brother, they use rubber bands to keep his money intact, if you don't like it you should ban rubber

Same four G's from last night (Money)

[Verse 2]
These days I really can't break 20s, hunnid and make money, money
Every month, the government will take money from me
Make 750, look how quicky I spent that, don't call me broke cause I strictly  resent that
Last my P had to flip my the rent, because the tax bracket I'm in's is 50 percent flat
All because of Ebay givin' me leway, basically do the PayPal, I need a raise now
Seems every time a nigga stop and he eat, I end up always tryna shop and compete
They know a nigga 'bout it when it's in his size and cops it in more colors than Popsicle Pete
Till I'm piled to the top with receipts, trust the store and I don't understand less is more
Wanna get 'em to the point where they owe me, and they gon' see Drake's on his JOB, it's like...
