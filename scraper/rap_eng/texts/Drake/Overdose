[Jackie Long]
And I'ma leave on one more note
One more motherfuckin' note
It's like this, look at him

[Intro: Drake]
I ain't been here in a minute
Cut the lights off
I feel fantastic right now, baby

[Verse 1: Drake]
I said I used to keep the porch lights on
And now I keep the Porsche's lights on
Just to let them know their foresight's wrong
Where this rapper goin' with that obscure ice on?
He a lame, I'm just tryna get my mature life on
OD, OD, everybody know me
Even fans that resemble them kids in the O.C.
Oh me, oh my, them girls love me like Seth Cohen
So get a grip, get a glass, pour the X.O. in
I dare one of these niggas to say I'm not insane
Pick a road 'cause where you drivin' is not a lane
And rest in peace to Pimp C, life is not a game
Takin' over the world, no Pinky, just a lotta brain
He 'bout to send them the shit that I'm on
You prob'ly could have predicted I'm on
My sense of judgment's officially gone
Up into the air all the smoke from the Swisher is blown
I'm grown, I'm grown
I'm livin' in this elevator zone alone
I'm up so high I'm never comin' down
And you say you got them hoes, but they never comin' round
I got Penthouse walls, I stay high above your ass
And I can see it all, my balcony is glass
And wifey's over (bitches), but money's over (her)
'Cause money's under (nothin'), my life is such a (blur)
That's not the way it has to go, that's just what I prefer
And do not disagree with me, it's best you just concur
I'm a legend with a legacy that can't help but survive
Even when I fuckin' die they gonna bury me alive

[Hook: Drake]
And I'm so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm livin' good, grippin' wood with all the features
Jesus, my money straight, no creases, p-p-peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air, we good (OD, OD)
Bitches over there, we good (OD, OD)
Money on the floor, we good
OD, OD, everybody know me

[Verse 2: Travis McCoy]
Oh no, Travie high on life again
Feel like I swallowed a whole bottle of Vicodin
So high I wanna cry like tiny violins
In my best mode, Depeche Mode, enjoy the silence
Stop the violence – how, when every line
Is like the motherfuckin' Watts riots pourin' out of my pen?
Aight then, be easy, I'ma get back
Gentleman with a superlative use of syntax
And I done gave up the narcotics
But I can't leave the crib without some xanax in my wallet
Hello, my name is Travie, and I'm a life-aholic
Told 'em all these beats is like the Wallace to my Gromit
The Alfred to my Bruce Wayne, stripes on my candy cane
One without the other, Soul 4 Real without the Candy Rain
Super trooper like a gun-totin' handyman
Ask me how I'm livin', bet I tell ya fine and dandy, man
Check his vital signs, they peakin' off the meter, man
I'ma live forever in Neverland with Peter Pan
Fuck pullin' the 9 out, I'll pull a Amy Winehouse
Sippin' Purple Rain with Mary Jane girls in my house
Isaiah, I'ma see ya when I get there
Until then hold me down like gravity, it's Travie (Uno, easy)

[Hook: Drake]
And I'm so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm livin' good, grippin' wood with all the features
Jesus, my money straight, no creases, p-p-peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air, we good (OD, OD)
Bitches over there, we good (OD, OD)
Money on the floor, we good
OD, OD, everybody know me

[Verse 3: Mickey Factz]
Ha! I’m 'bout to overdose on life
Somebody please pass the needle
So if I comatose tonight you won't have to ask the people
If the things that I seen through my Prada frames got me paid
Watch me, mane, I'm a cocky slave with this Rocky chain
I got I got my veins cluttered with this bud
And this name of it is Fame and it's all up in my blood
Tryna suppress the too fresh feeling I got, ooh yes
I'm in it for the hugest duplex, livin' like I'm Hugh Hef
Every other night I need a brunette for group sex
Leave 'em with a bruised neck, then I yell: "Who's next?"
Stand 'em in a line
This is New Factz City, take this crack between your thighs
(Yeah, Mickey, what you mean?)
I'm promethazine, fuck the Queen
Sniff the white horse of success and then let him lean
(Let 'em see…) Tryna match my high on life
(Then let 'em dream…) Gotta catch the spot on my flight
First-class, known of the aroma of the smoker life
Got me like a stoner, a zoner, but nah, it's never over
(Mickey, what you mean?) I stick my tongue out
Sippin' Remy conceited, I'm teasin' every bum out
Hung out with celebrities from every drug house
So when you remember me say that I was strung out
(Mickey, what you mean?) I'm a addict for the green cash
I'ma OD, so fluck goin' to rehab

[Hook: Drake]
And I'm so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm livin' good, grippin' wood with all the features
Jesus, my money straight, no creases, p-p-peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air, we good (OD, OD)
Bitches over there, we good (OD, OD)
Money on the floor, we good
OD, OD, everybody know me
