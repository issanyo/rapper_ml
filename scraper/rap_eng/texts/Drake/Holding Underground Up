Deuce Fella - Holding Underground up
Verse1
Feel this, drive
Daydreaming plottin the first steps im coppin got to show the world a motherfuckin mastermind
Critique my craft and meditate my math and flip that cash and write dem hits that stab em when they sleep
The weak can't catch the grind
You doubt this dream but thats just what I need you feeding my ambition, certified me
Best believe im gone get, mines..
And my beliefs is all that counts to me cause at that e.n.d. when i check out, ain't nobo,dy che,cking out but, me
So why should i believe in what you thinking bout my dream
Im having problems sleeping mind on a salary
Imagine the, deuce fella in a lamborgin
With my lil bro and my sis tryna be rich as me
A lucrative influence if you remember me. and take yo notes
Ima business man before rapper so i got much more than hope
These moves im making these clubs im shakin gone pay off cuz i know
And fuck a label im getting paper underground until i go. i go

Chorus2x's
{they stay gasin me up
They steal music conceal music
They credit you on them bucks
You ballin now but you owe later
Dont make it back and you fucked..
So im forever holding underground up.}

Verse2
They told me drop a single promote it and milk that cow till its old
Show my swag in a mixtape and sell that shit at my shows
That gone start up the hate, so spit some game to the hoes
Then let that radio play, and all the haters promote
Entertain yo bloggers and followers keep em talkin sumoe
Work them search engines and spend it they gone copy paste ya flow
Gotta switch it up and stay on get ya features up and cake swoll
Just keep investing yourself, and stay yo ass on the road
You know more money more problems you know them polices watchin
But a G jus gotta, play it, smart, cuz you can't stop em from jockin
Keep dem bail bond dollars and dont censent to searches patna
Dedicate yo mind to the grind and give yo problems to the father

[[Chorus2x's]
