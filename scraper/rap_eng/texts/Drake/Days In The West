[Verse 1]
Who you think you're talking to
I spent time alone long before I met you
These days lookin' like a dream since I've been on the road
Seein' shit that I ain't seen before and still there's no place like home
Spendin' all my days on the west side oh
It don't feel the same on the other side no
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryin' to put tomorrow in my own hands right now
I ain't like these other bitches ya'll just don't really know
Tryin to box me in that FM Stereo
Where the fuck was you when I was broke and I needed help
Ain't nobody put me on, did that shit myself

[Hook]
I'm tired of you not doing your research look me up
I been on it since I was 3 so look me up
Bet you never know I was so focused about my business
Got no time for all the flirty bullshit I ain't with it

[Verse 2]
Who you think you talkin' to?
I been working too damn hard to let you feel that way boo
Ninth grade I'm done with this school shit man my nigga fuck it
Been on this make my own mind and create my own look shit
Spendin' all my days on the west side oh
It don't feel the same on the other side no
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryin' to put tomorrow in my own hands right now
Prayin' that my family gonna last a little more
Livin' in a city that they can't afford
And that's why I'm 21 and Imma grind baby I don't play
And Know its hard to stunt right here in time check the resume

[Hook]
I'm tired of you not doing your research look me up
I been on it since I was 3 so look me up
You showing me how deep your ignorance is by your comments
The Internet really breeds bullies with false sense of confidence

[Breakdown]
(Why's it so hard to believe)
Why's it so hard to believe that a good... good
And a real one
Really be so on the shit that all these niggas tryin' to hit ya
Shall we need one
Yeah it's so hard
The double standards that we have break my heart
Why's it so hard to believe that she love to
Be selective
And somehow magically could still control her pussy and be happy bout it cause she gets it
Yeah it's so hard
And all the stigmas that we have break my heart
But you're not ready
To open up your mind and be mature already
You focused on the shit you seen before already
Never laid no visions till they pure already
I'm bored already
Of all the judgement they so insecure already
I was makin' my own music in my home already
You know I'm due for mixtape number 4 already
Already
