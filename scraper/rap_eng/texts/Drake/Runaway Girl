Hey there material girl
The neighbors told me that you're moving out
Leaving to witness the world
But are you sure that's what you're doing now

Are you running away for a purpose
Do you even know what your self worth is
The passport you carry in your purse is
The gift in the curse when you going head first is
The ATL, MIA, LAX, JFK
Luggage all packed and to them I say
Farewell to the pure, amen I pray

You wander the world
You seek what you've lost
You're waking up every day
The run away, run away girl
I turn and your gone
You're leaving to chase your fame
The run away, the run away girl

So long
Farewell
Good bye
Good day
Be on
Your way
Run away girl
(x2)

Watching it all through the window
And wishing you could make it shatter now
Now that you're here on the other side
Are you sure it even matters

Are you living the dream
Are you telling all your girls that it ain't what it seems
Do you strip do you model do you live in between
And look for the split second that you get on the screen like

You wander the world
You seek what you lost
You're waking up every day
To run away, run away girl
I turn and you're gone
You're leaving to chase your fame
You run away, run away girl

So long
Farewell
Good bye
Good day
Be on your way
Run away girl
(x2)
