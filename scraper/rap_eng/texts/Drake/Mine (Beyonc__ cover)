[Verse 1]
On my mind up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away
All that I can think of is, we should get married
We should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

[Chorus]
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say that you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say that you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to

[Verse 2]
From 8 until late, I think ‘bout you
You own my nights, I don’t know what to do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep
This whole thing's gone way too deep and we should

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

[Chorus]
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say that you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say that you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to

[Verse 3]
I gotta pull up on you
You gon' make me have to pull up on you
Don’t go Ghost on me, I'mma go Thriller on you, I'mma just
I'mma let my hands do the talking when I see you, baby girl
I miss feeling on you
I miss everything that's real about you
And that's everything about you that's just how I feel about you
I been about you and I’m still about you but
We ain't finished talking
I believe it's true
All I’m really asking for is you
