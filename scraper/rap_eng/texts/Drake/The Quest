[Intro]
Yeah
Look
I never been the type to take love
And never ever will I fake love
But maybe we can make love, yeah
I kinda like those things you do
You know I still got that thing for you
And maybe I can teach you a thing or two, yeah
And maybe we can touch a cloud
We might not make our parents prou
But, fuck it
Cause I be on some cool shit
But I ain't tryna prove shit
If you ain't tryna be down
Then we can just be cool, shit
Forreal though, like
We should leave it to the birds to hide
We might not make it to the other side
But tell me is you down to ride?
Cause they'll miss us, before we miss them
And they'll diss us, no matter what we give them
So like, fuck it
You down?
Or nah?
This is the quest

You are now on cloud number nine

[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I sit and wonder if it is what you say
You see, I know I got you feeling some kinda way
I'm trying to feel at home at that place that you stay
Or we can get it poppin' in some shit far away
I still feel like I'm on a quest for you
Getting dressed feeling like I'm getting dressed for you Opinionated but you make me digress for you
And I know you gotta do what's best for you
So I'm

[Pre-Chorus]
On cloud nine
Up past my bedtime
No rest at the kingdom
I'm up in my zone but I'm not alone
All that I can think of is
We should get higher
We can get higher

[Chorus]
Let's start rollin' up on this and let's get higher
Let's get higher
Let's get higher
Let's get higher (x2)

I just wanna say I'm yours, I'm yours
I just wanna say I'm yours, I'm yours
I know you think I'm playing
But I'm yours, I'm yours
I'm yours, I'm yours
I just wanna say I'm yours, I'm yours
I know you think I'm playing
But I'm yours, I'm yours

[Verse 2]
You see, I think it's dope that
We got two different minds
We got two different paths
And we on two different grinds
We got two different style
And stand on two different ceilings
But damn, some kinda way
We got identical feelings, it's like
I been through hell to get right where I am, and
You been through hell to get right where you are
I think it's meant to be that we're right where we are
So if you ever wander just don't wander too far
I'm still

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
But you wasn't really real
You ain't even really fuck with me
All this time passed and the shit still fucks with me
Got me thinking if the shit is what it's suppose to be
You said it was good but the shit just sucked to me
And you was just bad luck to me
Could have been the one
But you was just bad luck to me

[Verse 3]
Ayo
I'm the guy that's always tryna get high
And sometimes
I like to leave and be at one with the sky
And that's when
I get to thinking, damn another lonely night
Seem like love not for me
So I'm just loving my mic
I been through hell and back
Tryna fill this hole in my heart
And it fails, it just fails
And I'm just back at the start
My sanity then departs
And revenge is what I'm craving
Bodies dropping, steady plotting
Thinking 'bout assassination
As my guard gets stronger
Hit-list gets longer
Am I forever alone?
This the shit that I ponder
Are you out there in the world
Or did you already leave it?
If this is what love is
Then shit I don't really need it
So it's just back to the mic
And it's just back to the grind
No more opening up
No more wasting my time

[Outro]
Ima, ima be up here on a cloud
'Til I think it's time to re-up on the loud
Midnight on Cloud Nine
