Aw man
Look at where I am
Thank you to the fans
All up in my life span
Y’all know I'm the man
Thank you to the fam
Borderline crazy
Guarantee that I am
Anyway I'm hot
And you can’t stop me now
Better cool off quick
Before I burn the whole town
And like young Joc
You know its going down
Like JT
What goes around comes around
Holla at your boy
You know my flow is banging
And if I get a minute
I can have your body singing
Wait let me slow it down
I'm getting a head
My flow is getting hotter
Tryna make this bread
But imma shake this game up
Just to show y’all what's up
I never hand shake fist bump
I do me double clutch fist pump!
