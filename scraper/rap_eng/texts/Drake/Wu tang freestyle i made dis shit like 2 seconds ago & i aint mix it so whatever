[Intro]
Don't want no motherfucking niggas on my dick bitch
Yea..

[Verse]
I just love when I'm with you
Yea this shit's on ten
We used to be friends girl
And even back then you would look at me
With no hesitation and you'd tell me baby

[Chorus]
It's yours
It's yours
It's yours
That's for sure
That's for sure
Yea...

[Verse]
How you feel about the game girl?
And how a nigga came through on a new thing
Young nigga switch it up with the Wu-Tang
Now you turn around & look at me
And tell me baby

[Chorus]
It's yours

That's for sure
That's for sure
How you feel about!

And I'll show you
You won't be crying

Said I'm down on my knees
Darling begging you please
