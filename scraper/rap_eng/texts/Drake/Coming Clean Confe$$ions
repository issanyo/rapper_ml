[Hook:Drake]
My life is full of lies
Hypocrites try to put s**t through my mind
Try to block it out
I feel so helpless
So I look to the Heavens
Thats why I come clean in these confessions(x4)
[Verse 1:J-Train]
They told me I ain't supposed to be nothing but a no-hero
Why should I give a f**k about Coke Zero
I took the s**t from my sin
Tried to throw it all away
Felt like I didn't win
But then I found out
The Savior came down and died on the cross
But rose on the Third Day
Hypocrites try to blow me off while they smoking weed
Y'all heard alot of crap that I want to get off my back
Tell our government to stop putting the middle finger up my a**
Blonde girls try to act dumb and date scum
Black girls try to act white
Taken to Krispie Kremes at night
While white girls try to twerk on me,wait-no
I'm about to go high
Ain't need of a drug overdose
It's on a day that knows
But for now
[Hook:Drake]
