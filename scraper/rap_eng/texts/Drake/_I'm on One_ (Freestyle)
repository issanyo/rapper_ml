Intro: Drake (DJ Khaled)
(Get em up!)
I’m on one
(Get em up!)
Fuck it, I’m on one
(Get em up!)
I said I’m on one
(DJ Khaled!)
Ugh

[Drake:]
I’m getting so throwed
I ain’t went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don’t mean
Like, “what’s up with your best friend?”
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what’s up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?

But get it while you here boy
‘Cause all that hype don’t feel the same
Next year boy
Yeah, and I’ll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin’ off you ‘cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient, me
And 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate your bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations, I’m just
Feeling like the throne is for the taking
(Watch me take it)

[Drake – Hook]
All I care about is money and the city
That I’m from
I’ma sip until I feel it, I’ma smoke it ‘til it’s done
And I don’t really give a fuck and my
Excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older somebody
Shoulda told ya

I’m on one
Yeah, fuck it, I’m on one
Yeah, I said I’m on one
Fuck it, I’m on one

Two white cups
And I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be gotten, I'mma get that shit

‘Cause I’m on one
I said fuck it, I’m on one

[Lil Pharaoh:]

Listen
I said I’m on one, but I ain’t Washington
These niggas kno what time it is, so go ahead & clock ‘em in
I recognize I’m unsigned, & still in I’m tha hottest 10
U talkin’ ‘bout Adidas, what’s tha deal with u in moccasins?
What’s up with it? My flow is colder than an ICEE
Sick & tired of everybody tryna tell me what I “might be”
I’m a shootin’ star, but yet I’m makin’ all tha wishes tho
If there’s a better place, somebody tell me, when I get to go?
And flip it like reciprocals?
‘Cause I’m a MajorMove, they jus a smaller push
I try to give ‘em food for thought, then turn around & call it kush
I’m in it ‘cause it’s art, tha money’s really jus a benefit
They say I’m something new, I contradict and say I “been a hit”
It’s like a ghetto “Genesis”
And I don’t need tha money, it’s tha fact that it’s enticing
What’s tha good of havin’ cake, when you’re aware you’re missing icing?
So I’m hoping that it pays off, no more layaway
Dad, watch your “son shine”, & rain, rain, stay away
& I can see tha facade, don’t try to flatter me
U kno I’m what tha game needs, nigga, call me batteries
