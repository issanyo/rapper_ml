[Intro]
I feel good, I can't even sing but I'm gonna try
Sike
Maybe you can call in sick
Bring it to the room and get all this dick

[Verse 1: Futuristic]
Yo, I still got that voice that will make you go insane
I've been thinking about you Frank Ocean Novacaine
I get you wetter than the streets when it's pouring rain
And we can stay home like high school on snowy days
You know the name if not, then that don't even matter
I'm always on the run like I got a leaky bladder
I'm the shit like fecal matter
You don't trust me, I wonder why, cause I'm a freaking rapper?
Read the chapter baby don't ignore me
Or watch the show when it's Boy Meets World, Topanga I'll be Cory
I apologize if this seems kinda corny
But I got these teenage hormones, I'm kinda horny
That kind of stuff will probably make you wonder
Do I like freaky girls like Gucci and get them in a hummer
I probably do but just listen honey
That's probably true but just listen honey

[Hook: Drake]
I feel good, I got some time off girl it's been so long
Did you have fun, cause I'ma need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring it to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know I'm blunt but how real is that
You want this feeling back, well you should know
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go, it's better than you know
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go, it's better than you know

[Verse 2: Futuristic]
Yo, I still got all of these feelings I've been keeping
Never showed emotion to these chicks that I was freaking
I be missing you like every single weekend
I know you got my voicemails, never kept it a secret
And if you speechless let me tell you what it really is
I'm a changed man, used to be a silly kid
Listen to the rumors, things I never really did
Always tell the truth, never fake, see I really [?]
Shit, I see you trying to do your own thing
But just tell me if you miss me too
I wasn't ready for commitment back then
But now I'll let you tie me down, something like a tennis shoe
And now I got bread I could grow, we can go do some things that we don't normally get to do
So got a thing for me, I'll let it [?] if you tell me that it isn't true

[Hook: Drake]
