[Hook-King Libra]
All my life i wanted to do this
Everyday writing so i can pursue it
This for those people who was clowning me about making music
I mean what i want is pretty damn lucid
A record deal
A couple mill
A mansion on the hills
Niggas to keep it real
And bad chick without no flaws
Thick like nicki
Let me get a couple things out the way
Dawn of a young king
This the mixtape

[Bridge-Drake, PARTYNEXTDOOR, King Libra]
Spending all my days
Gone i be on the road
Eastside oh
Down but i’m not to hold
Other side oh
Ridin wit my niggas we the one they chose
Running through the city like i know you know
Party in the eastside oh
Silly nigga might lose his life on assumptions
Young nigga from the other side oh
I got a lot to say that's the last thing a nigaa wanna

[Refrain-King Libra]
See this can be forever shawty
Cause i'm telling you i'm done wasting time
I give you want you want shawty
Say what's on ya mind
So tell me that you love me
And tell me that is mine

[Verse 1-King Libra]
What is that these niggas really bout
Talking bout they down but they bluffin onna rip
Niggas want a challenge well come and test it
I’m really wit it
Judge me by my sound you dead wrong these bars
You can really get it
Coming down to ya set or ya town
You will get shut down
What yall mad at me for
Talking about the kid like you know the boy
Fall is mine october zone
I can't keep calm all the time
It ain't a thing but a king thing
