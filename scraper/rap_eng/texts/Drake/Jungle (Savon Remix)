Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do

Put a bib on me
Put a bib on me

These days, I'm lettin' God handle all things above me
(Put a bib on me)
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me
(Put a bib on me)
Listen, you can hear them callin' my name
(Put a bib on me)
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
(Put a bib on me)
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
(Put a bib on me)
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
(Put a bib on me)
That or it never existed
(Put a bib on me)
Whenever they say somethin' bout us you listen
(Put a bib on me)
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
(Put a bib on me)
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
(Put a bib on me)
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
(Put a bib on me)
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
(Put a bib on me)
My time with you, my
(Put a bib on me)

Put a bib on me
Put a bib on me
Put a bib on me

Yeah, these days these new girls, they got me nervous
(Put a bib on me)
They go to school and do bottle service
(Put a bib on me)
They can't decide, they keep switchin' majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
(Put a bib on me)
Call your number and it's out of service
(Put a bib on me)
Who can I call for your information?
(Put a bib on me)
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we've done?
(Put a bib on me)
Who is your replacement?
(Put a bib on me)
Are we still good? Are we still good?
(Put a bib on me)
Are we still good? Are we still good?
(Put a bib on me)
