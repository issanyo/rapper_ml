Intro
Can we turn the metronome off?
Yeah

Hook
Bust it like you can’t afford a car
You a pro
You a star
You know exactly who you are
Take it slow
Do it fast
Like you posing for the cam
Do it for the gram
Take it slow
Do it fast
Yeah
Whoa
Whoa whoa
Heard all them stories shawty
You should already know that I like it
If bands make her dance
She’ll be dancing for her life
Bust it bust it
Pull them vickies to the side
Whoa
Bounce that shit like whoa

Verse 1
They would say that you're amazing
Little know you heartless
Living life moving fast drive slow
Pump your brakes little shawty
Trying to get rid of me
You won't though
Yeah you mean
Stop acting so damn naive
Like keri hilson ya love done knocked me down
Damn I thought you always be around
Keyshia cole told me all girls like you were sent from heaven
You pretty as angel but you got no halo
Why did you tell all these people I done broke ya heart
It look like she carefree
Only on camera
Y'all can listen to the lies
I swear they all lies
I was that girl knight in shining armor all tires

Hook
Bust it like you can’t afford a car

Interlude
You are the only girl that when I run
I can't escape
When I dream I see you're face
I go the depths
Girl You're worth the chase

Verse 2
Shawty what's up with you I know its been a minute
I don't know what you been on but i know somebody in it
I don't know why I'm wondering whose getting it
I remember you use to tell me i got it
When I'm hitting it
Girl we used blow hookahs all day long
Right in ya house like chi Chong
Shawty when we link up bring them hookah bowls
Imma be 18 we can do the real jawn
We use to shotgun don't act like you don't remember
No texts no calls
Who really on ya phone?
​Y'all sleeping on a kid for so long
I just thought that you and your friends should know that
Took you from them niggas now them niggas got you back
Shawty i'm around the way now tell me where you at
Shawty i'm around the way now tell me where you at
