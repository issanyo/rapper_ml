[Intro: RALI]
Yeah...
I just kind of feel like...
I just need to -- get this off my chest

[Verse: RALI]
People always waiting on you to take the first step
Cause they're afraid of the pain of drowning in disappointment
When that's the price of success
It's a shame, it's a shame

The rap game will never be the same, be the same
The world is getting colder
And I'm just getting older
Cross paths with old friends
But I just change lanes

When people look at you like, "It's a bird. It's a plane."
They stand up on your shoulders and the view is insane
Empire state of mind
I'm running out of patience
I'm running out of time
It's no wonder that my rhymes are terminally ill...

Sick is underrated
Unlucky 13
And I'm the Dr. Foreman
Headed to my Dr. House
Just to get some Dr. Cuddy
And a new IV;

Infinite Vocabulary
What's its like to be a woman?
No Tyler Perry

Not that I'm a fag, but I ask
Cause relationships are difficult
And women get sensitive to the 10th power
Starting from the day a nigga pop her cherry

But that's just my opinion right?
And opinions are just feelings right?
I guess I just like to view opinions
As events without a witness
So rewind this, just to make sure that you hear it right

Fuck that nigga you with baby, you know I can hit it right
But I know I got a girl
See this the type of shit be going on in my mind
And it's heavy on my mind
Like my brain's in the gym
And my Frontal Lobe, is on a 1,000 Pound Curl like…

Like... Wait... Wait

My imagination's kinda scary
Bare with me for a minute please
I put my feelings in the grave where my soul buried
God don't you see me on my knees?

Please save me from my nightmares
I just wanna live my dreams
But I don't wanna play for fun
I would rather play for keeps…

[Bridge: Drake]
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up
