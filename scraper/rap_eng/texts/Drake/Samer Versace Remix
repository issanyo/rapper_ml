[Intro]
Uh, Versace remix you already know, whats good

[Verse: Samer Khalil]
Leaving my past behind, future aside, present alive
Uh, rolling with my caravan, no frenchies no comment ca va
Pushin`niggas off the top, too much pot, I should open up a shop
Rocking Louis jeans, belt Armani and Versace top
Smoking on that green, making that green all with the team
Hustling streets, they keeping it quiet like they ain't seen no fucking thing
We all toking up, been thinking plots and just chasing dreams
Keeping it real, everyday blowing offs of steam
Pulling up with rings, rolling up like kings
Coming up like a storm hit, haters hate cause we porsching
In the studio recording, doing it like it's important
Versace game we join it, top of the game we force it
Versace everything, believe in it like Peter Pan
Some things you just can't stand, cause it ain't planned and you late fam
They get reeled in, with no bands and they buy grams and they proud of them
How you stand your ground when you've got no ground to stand?
What's a peasant to a king
You don't get this, mother fucking Versace on his hit list
Foreign cars fast as fuck you probably missed us
Cemetery grave cause you diss us
Better think twice, if you want your life
When we roll up to your crib you, think through your rights
Think money think long, keep the future bright
If you're smart about your game, you'd stay out of sight
Got love for this like Aphrodite
Think money think long, keep the future bright, and get at me

[Hook: Quavo]
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
