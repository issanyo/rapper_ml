Yeah, its drizzy baby
Ah Ha uhh I’m ready, alright J fresh I got 'em

Look, I’m really the heir to the fortune of a millionaire
Talking money with me is really unfair
At the border like, "I swear, I have nothing to declare
I am nothing like these other niggas coming out this year"
Even if you never met me you can tell I’m on the same shit
Loyal as a mother fucker nobody be saying shit
Dope boys know me cause I often speak they language
So well spoken man I should have went to Cambridge
Y-o-u-n-g ho, women they can be so
Motivated by money that’s why they be on me for
Ask your favorite rapper homie guarantee that he know
If he is the one I’m the zero, (pshh damn)
Please comprehend I am a Surf Club general
I’m Mr. consistent I have never come in intervals
You don’t want be caught in the middle like a center fold
I'm committing suicide if we're ever identical
Click clack pow how you like a nigga now?
In control of my domain
They can do what I allow
And I know Toronto miss me I'mma be home in a minute
That's my city and I run it you just run around in it
They see me out in person and say I ain't heard you sing yet
The world is my playground dont fuck with my swingset
We get the pitching then that's when it gets to piling
I'm calling your bluff don’t act like you can’t see me dialing
I'm in, low cut Louis with them hard denim jeans an a beige jacket
Hands down the best in my age bracket
Holla at me
