[Verse 1: Jhene Aiko] (Voice Alteration)
What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, cause...

[Hook: Jhene Aiko](Voice Alteration)
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
For the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you've been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Nick Lifted]
Be ready so you don't have to get ready
She only gets ready when her hearts heavy
Looking to fill her void
Some study, why's it all about smokin' sexy
I see you hear the words, I know you're ready
To be different, start living, be a mystery
Simple and exquisite
Listen more than I talk and talk about my feelings
Pursue all of my thoughts and make them more appealing
Back to the blackboard and the chalk, I'm disappearing
On to a new adventure, venture out to discover myself and grow some feathers
Place the fact that our actions are what really is measured
Thinking back, my reactions are all backwards
It's a rap, we've unraveled, it's all haggard
Hit you with all facts, those dig deep like a dagger
Know you used to those stupid flows, got swagger
But I'm elegant and relevant 'bout what matters
Represent a dying breed, born to build a dynasty
Born from under that fire tree, torn between our conscious
Speaking to me like God at night, barely anything left that I know I gotta write
In the middle of this war and we forgot to fight
At the terminal, forgot the flight, I drop the mic
Dropping bars and I don't even drink
Watch close, don't even blink
Both eyes closed as we sink, I think
