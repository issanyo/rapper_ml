I guess this is goodbye, Goodnight and Goodluck
I'm sitting outside man I'm right in the truck
Bags packed, pack of black and milds lighting them up
I'm looking down on these niggas while inviting them up
I'd like to know the reasoning behind subliminals
Like who told them to mention me?
I am elevated homie, you are elementary
Telling them you selling dope and never sold a Century Sam
Saying you get denied off your entry exam
You get flow and you done fo', converse in one verse
About you fraud niggas that shoot never and run first
And ask Juicy if I Stay Fly
On the cellphone, and got a ten on the other end like an eight bi
Six two and they tell me you ye' high
They can't but they try, still get offended if I don't say hi
To me it's kinda gay if I'm saying hi to like eight guys
So I just walk past and keep it cool till the hate dies
I do nothing that would offend these cats
But I wish I had a spot where I could send these cats
Like here, sit on this island man and pen these raps
Bust them shots, pretend you trap, do whatever man
Long as you never find your way home I'm cool with it
I left you a shovel there, you know what to do with it
I never bust a gun, I'm Mister C-T-V
At least, I'm not Mister Dick Riding C-T-E
Rappers believe me, I'm cuttin' records with Jody Breezy
And that nigga would even admit that you flowin' Jeezy
Slow your roll this ain't a diss song
This song, will let you know I'm not the one to pick on
White with the yellow, the over easy I'm a swiss on
Only got a couple girls that I'm willing to kiss on
With the rest I turn the charm that they cannot resist on
If they wanna smoke they get they purple goodie twist on
But I can't call it, maybe you mad cause you fellas looking celibate
Two things that you are though is jealous and irrelevant uh
And I'm official, what's officially true
Is callin' names would only be beneficial to you
I just tiring you niggas, ya'll the michelin crew
I know a response is something that you itching to do
And YOU? you're smaller to me then a thumb tack
Music enjoy it, well I'm just tryna bring the fun back
But you making out all these dumb tracks, ya LL sixteens
Cause I listen to them and I don't call it come BACK
It's more like a shame or disgrace
Considering I'm the one that you aim to displace
But you the one I blame in this case
Without you to experience much of that desired fame at this rate
Your awkward ass singles, the lamest mixtapes
And this is what's making you say you came to get Drake
And I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, uh
I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, nigga
