[Verse 1: Bryson Tiller]

A beauty so divine [?]
Let niggas waste your time that couldn't afford it
And even though I fucked you, i still want you (still want you)
Every selfie take so perfect aren't you
Hold on baby I can't even stunt though
Hold on baby I can't get enough no
Open up your doors you lead the way for me
Fuck them other niggas, girl i plan for keeps

[Hook: Bryson Tiller]

Hold on wait a minute I ent ever sipping
But girl i gotta thing for your independence
Like can i get to know you we can take it slow yeah
Im not the one for guessing
(but i thought id let you know)

[Chorus]

Girl i gotta thing for you and you know
Girl i gotta thing for you and you know
Got class, got ass, body got a bottle shape, she don't fuck with any niggas many, niggas by the way
Girl i gotta thing for you and you know
Girl i gotta thing for you and you know
Got class, got ass, body like a bottle shape, she don't fuck with any niggas many, niggas by the way
