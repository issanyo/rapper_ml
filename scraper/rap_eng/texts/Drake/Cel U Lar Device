You used to call me on my cellular device at night
You used to call me on my cellular device at night
And I know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Boy, you got me down, and got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started gettin' dressed and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some dudes I've never seen before

[Hook]
You used to call me on my cellular device at night
You used to call me on my cellular device at night
And I know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing
(Two one four, witness!)

[Verse 2]
Some people just said let it go
And on and on and such and such
But they don't ride around with us
No, no, no
Ain't that too bad we love to hang
And for a while, it stays the same
But now you tryna change the game
No, no, no

[Hook]
You used to call me on my cellular device at night
You used to call me on my cellular device at night
And I know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing

[Bridge]
Late night when you need my love
Late night when you need my love
Late night when you need my love
Late night when you need my love

[Interlude]
You've reached the Erykah Badu hotline
If you're calling for Erykah, press 1
If you're calling to wish her a happy birthday, Kwanzaa, MLK, Black History Month, Juneteenth, or Hanukkah, press 2
If you're calling because you just saw her on B.E.T, MTV, or any other social media outlet, and you're checking to make sure you're still in good standing, press 3
If you're calling to beg for some shit in general, press 4
If you're calling to beg for some shit, but this is that pre-call before the actual begging, press 5
If you've already made that pre-call and this is the actual call to beg, press 6
If you're calling to ask for some free tickets in a city near you, and know she don't really fuck with you like that? Press 7
If you're calling to book Erykah, to flip the first burger at your company BBQ, or to DJ at your little cousins slip-and-slide party, press 8
If you're calling to say peace, and don't really fit into any of those descriptions
Text me, because I don't really answer voicemail
