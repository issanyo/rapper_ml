[Drake talking]
Southern Smoke

(Money) Frank Dukes
(Money) My man Nickelus F
(Money) Ho! It's Drake. Southern Smoke
(Money) This is the remix right here
(Money) So if you got some (Money)
Put ya hands in the air
(Money) Southern Smoke

[Verse 1: Drake]
Now-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled
(Right) Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve
This ain't Brad Pitt, I gotta admit
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, cause it's a bad fit
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy
So, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy!

[Hook]
I, take time arrange that (Money)
Some, kill just to claim that (Money)
Switch countries exchange that (Money)
You cannot get jack for freeee

And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's, no need to stash right (Money)
Got the same, four G's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from me, homie

[Verse 2: Nickelus F]
Money’s the reason my best friend got murdered
So with that and my amounts tryin to make it just to burn it
Milk the game, turn it to butter, look how I turned it
No chick shall get any of dis unless she earns it
Take that dick, put to your lips and insert it
Where the hell is self-respect go when them checks show?
You sleep with them anywhere, hell is your bed for?
You always on your back, what the hell is your legs for?
I know, walk that strip, get my grip
That new Benz’s comin out, put some 'umph' in your switch, trick
Plus I need rims, diamonds and gems
So get up, do the hand job, and some head for him
I got my mind on my money, and my money on your mind
I’ll blow your mind all over the money that’s on your mind
So keep my dough off your head, fuck with do on your head
Now you really got money on your mind, nigga!

[Hook]
