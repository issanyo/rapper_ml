[Verse 1: Angel Inn Levi]

I could've been here before at a younger age dropping hits non stop
What are they going to say when I pull up in a new drop
Looking like I'm trying to live in thug mansions like 2Pac
Schooled them
Moving on to those "M"s now
Maybe we can work it out
Maybe I need working out
If I make moves trying to get it back
You wouldn't even have to ask
I'm to innocent
Do I recall the better days?
Purely amazed
Trying to take the stage
I learned to play
I learned to make this money when I was young
I learned to hustle and shit at an older age
You would be amazed at how I made it
Studied the game and how to play it
But I'm not playing about the money
I just got to find the faster rate
Even in the dope drought only I can put it out there like this
I have made these companions trying to move forward and never go back
I'm not feeling sorry thanks to God today all though the all black's on
Got to look both ways before you cross the street
No telling where you be
Just know we got that heat released

[Hook]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

[Verse 2: Drake]

All these hand outs
Man it's getting outta hand
I'mma start telling niggas get it how you can
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night that I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place
First place
Man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times
Paid 1.5 for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang
I want to do major things
MJ in every way
I just don't fade away
Six upside down
It's a nine now
Like Mannie
Like Stunna
Man shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

[Hook]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

[Outro: Angel Inn Levi]

"Riding through the six."
"Riding through the six."
Flow tight
Slit wrist
Look at the wrist how it glistens
Make it hail from the mist
I got my eyes on your chick
"Riding through the six."
"Riding through the six."
