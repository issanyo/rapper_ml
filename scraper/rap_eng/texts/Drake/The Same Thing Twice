[Producer Genius]

[VERSE I]
Jesus help me
Please just help me
Come right back again

Everything's okay
At least that's what
I tell my friends
But its all made up
And i have changed
Just make it for the best

Cuz it is if you say so
Say

[VERSE II]
Sittin' in a spin
Telling everybody where i been
But it's getting old
Wanna go back to me and my friends

When he hit the club
Everybody wanna see em
Tellin' me to drink up
Really drink up but I really don't drink like that

I am what I am
I be on my lonely on my own
Why they in my biz
Why is everybody on my phone

When i make a song like - hollup
Run up in ya song like "hollup"
Is-tan-bulla
Turkey zigguns
Swear i get up on the beat and murk these zigguns
On they mutha-mutha...

I don't really know
But the mighty head's the only one to roll
Don't ever really wanna know too much or at least
Don't wanna ever let em think i do

Aaye, its all right
Calm down
Son-
You ain't heard it?
You the bomb now son

They never gonn do -
Never gonn love like that
And I don't got time for your drugs no im never doing drugs like that

I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish

[Hook]
How you feel about
Going home with a
Sinner for tonight?
If you nervous- hit the lights
I know we only bumpin out of spite
Cuz ya man don't do you right
Do you right. do you right

Futhamuckas only
Want me making
Beats for em on the side
I know how it feel to be the side
I would never make you that tonight
I mean i don't think you'd be everything
But...you'd be everything

[VERSE III]
I was all alone
Old friend hit me on the phone
He said
"Before you hang up
Me and buddy out here in the cut
Look -i know its been a long while, but...whats up
If you really trynna get up out of here
A minute and just kick it i will come and pick you up."

I said yeah yeah
Check check
Check check
I'll be there when i get the next check
But I'm grinding till then best bet
And I'm lying - really suspect

You'd think
You'd think people- peopled mean more
They don't really where i come from
And it don't change even when you grow up

But its alright- It's alright, it's alright
To tell the truth
Even when the truth don't rhyme
Even when you're on the record
Even when everybody's lookin'

Confessing my sins
I got a whole lot
Molested - uh.. i was young...
I hope she grew up okay...
I'm sorry

How you feel about
Knowing all the
Secrets in my lines ?
Even if they really don't rhyme
Even say the same thing twice
Sometimes sometimes
...so

How you feel about
Knowing that i can't keep it to myself
I don't want you anybody else
I don't wanna keep it to myself
People : I don't like people
I don't deserve them

[Verse IV]
To my city
I get it i get it
Id never be hot there and thats why
Im not there i know i admit it

And nine out of ten times i
Wouldn't have doubted my self for a minute
But i swear it's taking so long that uh
Even my name reminiscing
It's one time

This cutting into my fun time
This ain't no game cuz i run time
It don't stop for a minute
Son i'm
Done wait

Lastly - God changed my life very fastly
Wanna shoot me down - that's yo ass b
Wanna go to heaven
Then you gotta let him be great
