Oh did you ever
Feel like life is
Just a tough situation?
Trust me you'll find yourself
In a field in the middle
Of the night. Why?

'Cause it's time
For night fun
Yeah, you can't forget it
Sun's never gonna
Come up if we just
Party all night

Y'all know what it feels like
To party all night, right?
So let's get this started!
I'm never gonna regret this
Except for you, you, you

One big fan of Drake
Walked into the field
And said "hello"
I just don't care
How y'all react

Nightime party for
The whole time
Yeah, y'all are invited
Nighttime party for
The whole time
Sorry but you gotta come

No one in the world
Is allowed to skip it
'Cause it's filled with fun, yo!
You can get on the carousel
Or maybe just have a free campout

No one can skip it
My rules, you follow
This isn't payback
One possible answer-
Imma do this every night!

Nighttime party for
The whole time
Yeah y'all are invited
Nighttime party for
The whole time
Sorry but you gotta come

As the sun rises up
The party disappears
Until another night
Yo, you can't stop it
If I were you

Yo you can't stop it
If I were you

You you can't stop it
If I were you
