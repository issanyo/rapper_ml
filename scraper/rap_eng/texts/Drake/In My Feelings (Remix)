[Intro: Drake & Yung Miami]
Trap, TrapMoneyBenny (trap)
This shit got me in my feelings (City Girls!)
Gotta be real with it, yup

[Chorus: Drake]
Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always

[Verse 1: Yung Miami]
Let me show you what Miami 'bout (let me show you)
I wanna take you 'round my mammy house (let's ride)
I don't even like my niggas bread (hell nah)
But since you got that bread, you can give me head
He wanna hit it, he can get it for a foreign car (ow!)
Yeah I'm with it, I'll lick it like a porn star (slurp)
I'll show him how to network (facts)
Fuck that Netflix and chill, what’s your net worth? (cha-ching)
Hah, big boy status, like 'em pretty huh? (pretty bitch)
With a real stank walk, from out the city, huh? (City Girls)
Keep my hands out, favorite word is “gimme”, huh?
Show me you love me to the bank, lil' daddy give me some (Drizzy!)

[Chorus: Drake]
'Resha, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
J.T., do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always

[Verse 2: J.T.]
J.T.! I like it when you rap, when you sing to me (yeah)
But it's even wetter when you spend that green on me (where that money at?)
Put that Birkin, new Chanel, that CÉLINE on me (bags)
I'm down for you all the way, no between with me (nah)
Drizzy Drake, you want a city bitch, boy, you gotta spend that cake
Two bad bitches and we kissin' in the wraith (muah)
I need that black card and the code to the safe (hmm)
Donate to this pussy like you in a M.I.A
Ayy, God's plan!
The money right, I'll bring my best friend (Miami!)
Pussy good, gon' need a vest, man (yeah)
Make it rain at the weddin', period!

[Chorus: Drake]
Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
