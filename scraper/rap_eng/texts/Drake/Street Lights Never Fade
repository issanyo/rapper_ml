[Verse 1]

This is no second chance, this right here's a letter
I was gonna send it later but now is better
It was set for delivery at graduation
I'll recite it now to clear my reputation
You think I'm lonely, Akon wants his girl back
But that's not the reason I wrote this rap
Me and you have definitely grown from that
I just want to break the ice, Titanic cracks
Want to say in many ways you inspire me
Handling your business like a boss, not employee
The way we cared for each, listened careful
Sacrificing time living now and not for later
This is something I gotta get off my chest
Even though we moved on I still hope for the best for you
I'm a guy who can keep his distance
But my respect for you is a truth I can't resist

[Verse 2]

Not often but when I do reminisce
It's on how we ran the world with an iron fist
On how you were protected by the walls you built
The way your mind was high above my cries of guilt
You stayed rational when I was a heartless wreck
Picked up the broken pieces like a skateboard deck
Worth it in the end the fights we fought
Even though the way it ended was not my thoughts
Appreciate your act of acceptance
The closure help my stance, my independence
You have this finesse that is under minded
By your willingness to keep everything aligned
Get what I'm saying? All your acts of kindness
Give sight to those who suffer blindness
The feeling now is mutual
Grew a goatee for someone that I used to, know
For sure you got my back still like plan b
When your name pops up it enlightens me
Knowing your heart is strong enough to carry on still
You singing voice enough to set off the fire drill
I'm getting trembles just by typing this out
I hope you realize who I'm talking about
I'm not wishing for us to be as one
I just hope you listen to this when your practice is done

[Verse 3]

Above it all I want to show you gratitude
Not many people can handle my attitude
Conversations sailed fluid with a ship afloat
We built on a conversation from Death Note
The night we walked down Bell Air
Had the street lights glisten glee from out of your hair
And when we talked again about a year ago
I knew our maturity was at a steady growth
While my thoughts for you are out in the open
I have a reassurance that nothing is broken
We'll never talk in the current world
But you'll stay in my heart as the one girl
That listened

[Outro: Drake]

Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I have to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient and waited to long
But I woulda came back, but I woulda came back for you
Woulda came back, woulda came back
