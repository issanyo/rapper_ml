Every now and then
Counts as a year
For all the things
We do to help
The seasons change

We no longer fear
The bad things that
We caused and it
Doesn't even count
When every second
Is thrown away

Don't think about it
No don't do anything
You desire to
Live your own life
For you need my approval

You gotta do what He demands
Or there will be
Serious changes on the world
Don't look at it
Don't imagine it
For you I'll guide you up

Don't think about it
No don't do anything
You desire to
Live your own life
For you need my approval

Don't think about it
No don't do anything
You desire to
Live your own life
For you need my approval

This is the end
Of it all
Don't mourn about it
Sometime it will
Be put back together again

I don't care
Whether you want to live
Or to die on your own
You just need to trust me
Or you're done for

Don't think about it
No don't do anything
You desire to
Live your own life
For you need my approval

Don't you think about it
Don't you do anything
You desire to
Live your own life
For you need to support me

That's right
This is the end
This cannot be undone
Freezing to death
Or burn in Hell
It is my choice
But domination rages on

Don't think about it
No don't do anything
You desire to
Live your own life
For you need my approval

Don't you think about it
Don't you do anything
You desire to
Live your own life
For you need my approval

Dont think about it
Don't do anything
You desire to
Live your own life
For you need my approval

Don't you think about it
Don't you do anything
You desire to
Live your own life
For you need to support me
