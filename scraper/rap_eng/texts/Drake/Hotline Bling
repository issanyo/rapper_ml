[Intro: Drake]
You, you, you, you
You

[Verse 1: Marz Ferrer & Drake]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows I feel left out
You got me down, you got me feeling so stressed out
Ever since I left the city, you
Started looking fresh and goin' out more
Bottles of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with your boys that I've never known

[Chorus: Marz Ferrer & Drake]
You used to call me on my cell phone
You used to call me on my cell phone (phone, phone, phone)
You used to call me on my cell phone
Call me on my cell phone
Late nights when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late nights when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 2: Marz Ferrer & Drake]
Ever since I left the city, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I just did you wrong
Going to some places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
And hangin' with your boys that I've never known

[Chorus: Marz Ferrer & Drake]
You used to call me on my cell phone
You used to call me on my cell phone (phone, phone, phone)
You used to call me on my cell phone
Call me on my cell phone
Late nights when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late nights when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Outro: Drake]
Ever since I left the city, you
