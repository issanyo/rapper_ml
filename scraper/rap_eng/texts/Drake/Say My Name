[Verse 1: Salience]
Fill up all of my cup
Give me all of your love
All I need is just that touch
I'm not here to go and judge
Take you back to my place, you and me
Get you pillow talking fluently
Take your clothes off and your jewelry
Get you all the way down-down to your knees ay
Name a time and a place and I'll be there
You're so hot, you be giving me a fever
Take your time, I'll be getting more eager
Let me get to know you just a little bit deeper
Let me show you luxury
You and I make good company
Whisper in your ear so subtly
Come here, babe, make love with me and

[Hook: James Fauntleroy & Drake]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, “Baby, I love you”
If you ain’t running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin’ kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

[Verse 2: Salience]
Say my name so your old boy goes and hears it
Show him you are fearless
And he ain't allowed near it
I got you babe and you know I'll never let you go
You stole my heart, but my love supply is plentiful
And now hypnotized by the way you're dancing
I'll treat you like a queen; I'll make your life enchanting
'Cause now I know how to treat a lady right
And I know that you gon love it, you can stay here day or night
And if you want it there, I'll take you there
You say you love me, and I'll say I care
You get mad at me when I ain't prepared
But sorry those 3 words get me scared
I don’t know what got over me
I'll bag it up like groceries
Don’t write me off like a notary
I guess love is what the beholder sees
And I know, don’t tell it
Right now I'm being so selfish
I know that you and me right now is all the matters so don’t you sweat it
So baby, listen to me right now
We have it on, I don’t really wanna fight now
Leave it 'til tomorrow, all you gotta do is say my name and turn all the lights down

[Hook]
