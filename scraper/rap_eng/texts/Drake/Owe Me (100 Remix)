[ K Zeus: Intro]

You owe me (X2)
You better have my money like my real name god respect that g.o.d (X2)

[ K Zeus : First verse]
I'm just here spitting real sh*t
You know just trying to pay the bills sh*t
I make music trying to get the millions
I was In love even told that girl my feelings
Now I Leave it to God and hope that she feel it
But right now I'm focused on making killings
Oj the game consider me the villain
But I'm Wayne right now I have no ceilings
Black eye peas man i got a feeling
That the games our money women and the children
Man I turn up as soon as we in the buildings
And we killed the game when we was just chilling
Now im focused things in motions
Flow fluid and deep as the ocean
No more coasting I'm just roasting
All my goals on the gram I be posting
Some videos on snapchat
Turning up with the ovo hash tag
Couple checks girl  i might cash that
I'm feeling good that I did good in math class
Now all that success you can add that
Those who me doubted me subtract that
Distribute those freaky hoes
I do what I want why cause I'm Grown
I just ask you
That you keep it keep it real
I'm a man I don't  get caught up in my feels
I just Keep it keep it real
Divide that pie with my fam
Those Who keep it keep it real
And all of my good friend Who Stayed
Real to that real  end

[Drake : Hook]
Y'all better not come to my studio wit' that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral wit' that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever ask is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100

[Drake : Second Verse]
Thank me later, thanks for nothin'
Thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearing your true colors to every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they was skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop
And I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Nobody's even hearin' it on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself

[Drake : Hook]
Y'all better not come to my studio wit' that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral wit' that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever ask is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100

[K Zeus : Third Verse]
Im Ether in flesh Im fresh to the death
I burn through the best then proceed to the next
Why where a vest most kings get shot
Popped in the head straight chopped in the neck
I'm not gangster but I'll kill you
Make it so blind person  can't feel you
I'm wondering when you lost the real you
Probably when you got the deal dude
But I know I ain't got time for the bull kid
I be next Derek jeter all in the bull pin
5000 hits all up in my iTunes
Nigga get high then they become high coons
My Poetry ill kill you with a haiku
Tiles glow when I walk like Michael
Kanye blasting that real friends
Over the years I lost so many real friends
Sometimes I br mr solo dolo
Don't even want kids cause kylo killed Solo
I'm Zeus man you know I had to slay   cronos
He saw us all starving and kept the door closed
Now it seem like my own fam hate me
When I just wanted them to shine and be great be
Bull going around like a skate key
I never want to cut m em off they  make me
