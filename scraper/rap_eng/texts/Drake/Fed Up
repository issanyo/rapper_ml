[Intro: Usher, (DJ Khaled) & Young Jeezy]
DJ Khaled (DJ Khaled!) (yeah!)
Oh oh (the streets is fed up)
(Who else nigga?) Ohh
(We fed up) Yeah man (We The Best)
The Runners, Usher, talk to 'em

[Hook: Usher]
Yeah, yeah
It was all a dream, yeah homie I am on my job
And you can't take that away from me
Yeah I got my team, and I got all of my niggas behind me
And they give me the love I need (yeah)
I got my foot in the door, still hustling for more
Check in the game now I'm back in the light, yeah
I'm fed up (hey) I'm fed up (hey) I'm fed up
I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I am absolutely, positively on my grizzy
Even though I'm sick and I'm tired, I gets busy
Started a 62, but it ended up a frisbee
And me, I like to stand at the stove until I'm dizzy
Ball so hard it's like I brought the game with me
Left my glove so white you thought I brought Jermaine with me
'Bout to paint a perfect picture like I brought the frame with me
I give it all up before I let the fame get me
I got niggas tryin' to sue me, bitches tryin' to do me
Way these niggas actin', you'da thought they never knew me
But these niggas know me and half them niggas owe me
I'm fed up, it's why I'm actin' like the old me

[Hook: Usher]
Yeah, yeah
It was all a dream, yeah homie I am on my job
And you can't take that away from me
Yeah I got my team, and I got all of my niggas behind me
And they give me the love I need (yeah)
I got my foot in the door, still hustling for more
Check in the game now I'm back in the light, yeah
I'm fed up (hey) I'm fed up (hey) I'm fed up
I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm sick and tired of you suckers so now I'm fed up
Somebody catch the chain, I'm 'bout to tear his head off
Shawty bendin' over knowin' I'm 'bout to tear it up
Before you let your top back, get your bread up
Made history, but now we claimin' victory
Get ya out the White House, go back to your efficiencies
Suckers feel me and I know you haters hear me
Like the IRS, you wonder what I'm makin, yearly!
With them brown bags circulate, so I perpetrate
We shinin' than the bottom cause we're down to twerkulate
Lookin' at the parking lot; better get your mind right
I hope you fed up being broke because the times right
Ross!

[Hook: Usher]
Yeah, yeah
It was all a dream, yeah homie I am on my job
And you can't take that away from me
Yeah I got my team, and I got all of my niggas behind me
And they give me the love I need (yeah)
I got my foot in the door, still hustling for more
Check in the game now I'm back in the light, yeah
I'm fed up (hey) I'm fed up (hey) I'm fed up
I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uhh, me and Wayne was gettin' high on 'em
He leaned over and told me, "Just don't retire on 'em
And when they give ya they shoulders, never cry on 'em
And when they love you to death, just never die on 'em"
And the question still remains
Have I counted all the money that I've managed to obtain?
Niggas dedicatin' overtime to damagin' my name
And somehow I'm still the hottest motherfucker in the game

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
(I’m happy to be back man!) I’m tired of these haters
That’s why I go hard like A.C. Slater
Weezy Baby here, y’all pre-natal
I just get the beat and murk it out like Fredo
Uhh, I’m sick of bein' criticized
That’s why I’m higher than the Star Trek Enterprise
I do it big, don’t get mad cause you minimized
I keep a red flag in case I get penalized
Uhh, it's Young Money like you didn’t know
Stop playin', I hit Drizzy with the give-and-go
It was all a dream, now we the dream team
Who trying to see us? You seein' things
Hustle like I still pay rent man
Got a chest full of heart, no Tin Man
Uhh, Kha-Kha-Khaled I’m fed up
Flow wake the dead up, Weezy

[Verse 5: Usher]
Yeah, hop out, I been in this, been breakin records since '94
So I ain't gotta brag about records that I’ve broke
Records that I hold and records that I’ve sold
And I’m fed up with these niggas relieving my lingo (yeah)
Don’t bite the hand of your provider
You sayin' I ain’t influenced you, you a liar
I’m on fire, you just a biter
You need to wake up and realize it was all a dream

[Hook: Usher]
Yeah, yeah
It was all a dream, yeah homie I am on my job
And you can't take that away from me
Yeah I got my team, and I got all of my niggas behind me
And they give me the love I need (yeah)
I got my foot in the door, still hustling for more
Check in the game now I'm back in the light, yeah
I'm fed up (hey) I'm fed up (hey) I'm fed up
I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired
