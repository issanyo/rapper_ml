I'm bout to self destruct "Dee Dee don't press that button"
Its Dexters laboratory I'm thinking about inventing something
No Jay-Z "Blueprint" or nothing I'm bout to make cake yeah like I'm baking muffins
Give me one shot like an assassination i just need one shot call it flu vaccinations
I just want a Chance like " I Love New York" but I'm so Columbus that means it's just a vacation
Told Drizzy put me in like an application, so i feel this girl out in my niggas basement
She ask "can i eat?" and i said " no problem" so i did and she started yelling "RED ROBINS" yum
I'm getting busy on you bums Bone Thugs and Harmony really Bizzy on you bum
Them niggas over there mad cause they thought that i was done til i started flipping hard cause I'm flipping it off the tong
Got more green than a packer drake Toronto like a Raptor gave a shout out to my Buckeyes done made me a rapper
No I'm not racist white girls in my cabin so i make it rain on them throwing cheese on them crackers. (ha)

I'm about to blow you already blew it, oh you didn't know you probably never knew it
Silly girls going dumb acting hell of stupid usually she don't but she will if i let her do it
Oops! that was out of line but i don't apologize if i say sorry a thousand times it would all still be all a lie
I don't want to take that route to rhyme so my own road I'm bout to drive it my turn hard grind hit a verse now it's mine
Yea it's me Killa  i began the ball game but i ain't playing got em gone from the fall game and this means i started with an art frame
I filled it with my art that was drawn out in hard paint so if you thinking that I'm soft let that thought change
I'm a rip ya mind tissue leave you with a scarred brain heard truth hurts so i do worst harsh pain
Bust another feel the hit when my heart BANG! witnessing the pain i cause now have to hurt scene
And if the judge hit you i know that will hurt eternally making the twatty new listeners act like they heard of me
They want to play a part in my actual currency but that's funny so I'm laughing for certainly
Because you never even know the half what it's worth to me i do it for the love I'm not rapping to work for free
And everywhere its taken me at i deserve to be
