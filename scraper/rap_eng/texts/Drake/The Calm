[Verse 1]
Uh
I'm just so far gone
October's own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on
Where did we go wrong
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on
When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget them and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been three years
Look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't
Cause

[Break]

You know everything gon' be all right, I promise
I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position vent to y'all but
40 Mama always say don’t ask permission
Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became trying to make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention, therefore, women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame
Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwyane
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
So I'm lifting all alone try not to get a sprain
Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in Memphis Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why your girl heart is in a slang
Call me "Heartbreak Drake", I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man, I'm just honest; as an artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
Yea, and see, this is the thang
What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single-handed reason I remain me

[Outro]
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Swear I’m putting on
And everybody wanna ask
What type of act you putting on, like
Man
