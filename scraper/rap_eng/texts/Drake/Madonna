[Verse]

It's been like 5 months
And my ex still giving me hell
Bout that verse and shit
I just speak how I feel
You know keeping it real
The truth can really hurt some shit
I don't do too much talking
So don't be surprised
If I really start merking shit
Told you not be surprised
When I started merking shit
Lord please take the wheel
She just said that I'm famous
When I'm tryna stay humble
I can not drop the ball
They hoping that I fumble
Oh lord
I just made a play
You should see they face
Let me hit the Ickey Shuffle
After the touchdown
For the one time
Shoe box all the new money
So it can age well like Madonna
All my niggas focused on the future
Singing "fuck up some commas,"
She might be a sauna
But looks can really be deceiving
Mannn just look at Rihanna
