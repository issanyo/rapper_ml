[Chorus:]
I'm still fly, I'm sky high
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings
I'm still pullin out the Phantom, and these haters can't stand me
Yeah, I'm still doing my thing

[Verse:]
Responsible for everything you listen to, a mediocre tallent, let me see if I can condition you
Took over my city, and I never asked permition to
Started poppin bottles, cause it's ATL tridition to
Celebrate with Bob Ma, fuck him at the So-ho
If there ain't an elevator in it, it's a no go
Coldest thing dropping, and these bitches wanna snow blo
They just give me head, while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ should've won that
Listen and respect, the city almost won back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, halla at me when you're done laps
Roll around with Neego, Party with Azooka
Shout goes out to 1Da, shout goes out to Future
Shout goes out to Getti, motherfucker I am ready
Whoever got the torch, just can't seem to hold it steady
Cause I see the flame flickering, x girls bickering
Got these women jockin me from Holly Grove all the way to Picker Ring
I tryed to send my nigga Short some syrup out in Michigan, but my connect said it'd take a minute if you listening
Please start doing you, I been doing me
And I'm a staple in my city, you can never ruen me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewing me
But I got love for everybody, even if you suing me
My brother P-rain know, we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he tought me how to spot an officer in plane clothes
Starin at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hopin on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy, please do not harass me
Just halla if you got me, fuck you if you had me
Shout goes out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver, and 40, man, you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to B Plus
The names I mention are crooshel, you gonna need us
And life is good, everything is just fine
I am so sure of my rhymes, I could sacrafise a line
I sware, I really fuckin does it
I had these niggas trippin, no luggage
[Chorus:]
I'm still fly, I'm sky high
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings
I'm still pullin out the Phantom, and these haters can't stand me
Yeah, I'm still doing my thing

[Chorus:]
I'm still fly, I'm sky high
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings
I'm still pullin out the Phantom, and these haters can't stand me
Yeah, I'm still doing my thing
