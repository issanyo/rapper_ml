[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I’ve never seen before
'Cause ever since I left the city

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
(Call me on my cell phone)

(I know when that hotline bling)
(That can only mean one thing)
(I know when that hotline bling)
(That can only mean one thing)
