[Verse 1: Zay Davey]
See it used to be a struggle
Since we made it safe from our seats will unbuckle
In our heads we would worry about trouble
Like how would me make it chest deep beneath the rubble
And now we look down on it like hubble
All the haters start to mumble because we scored they fumbled
And now we just sit and chill
As we count the countless bills and we realize this is real
We're at the top to this game you jack and jilled
Never pay for shit again always have free refills
Never plain on breaking so there is no plan for rebuild
Wish i could keep this feeling forever that's how we feel
So if you're wondering if we'll be fine its yes
And if my crew is down you ain't even gotta guess
You know i love my lifestyle so you think im blessed
Being at the top is perfect because there's no more stress

[Hook: Drake]
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double you ain't even gotta ask
Because it's hard to say no
Yea it's hard to say no
Are you down are you down
Yea you're all the way down every time
Am i down am i down
Yea I'm all the way down we'll be fine

[Verse 2: Lazy Shirts]
I'm fine we're fine but yes of course we murder time
This beat's a corpse in the back of the room that's mine
Mess with you because you're dumb and we're just having fun
Dreams of making millions that's paper to the cieling
And i ain't saying we the shit but if you gotta
Then let them know to hit the road we taking over shows
And like a penalty i got red flags
In the sky in disguise my boys ride
I would look outside if you feel somebody's watching
Tick tock im knocking clocks in man screw a clock in
This the team and you could say we do it often
Zay Drizzy and Jerz we get it poppin

[Verse 3: Zay Davey]
You can call me superman with an S upon my chest
Never give rappers chances because I'm always at my best
I keep the comp worried like game set and match
And they wonder how they get out like where's the escape hatch
Drake already said that we'll be fine
No more take out for us we wine and dine
Never dull moments when living express line
Now watch us do our thing no need for stars aligned

[Hook: Drake]
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double you ain't even gotta ask
Because it's hard to say no
Yea it's hard to say no
Are you down are you down
Yea you're all the way down every time
Am i down am i down
Yea I'm all the way down we'll be fine

[Verse 3: Jerzey]
We'll be fine got my fam and my homies
What's the time gotta make sure my girl ain't lonely
Oh but i gotta remind dont forget that we the only
Greatest ones in this last year in this cuz
We be getting rich can't even make a wish
Man i swear it's like we run these kids we be throwing back our lids
What we say is what we do even if it is
Something that's too cold for you because we dont care if you freeze in this

[Hook: Drake]
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double you ain't even gotta ask
Because it's hard to say no
Yea it's hard to say no
Are you down are you down
Yea you're all the way down every time
Am i down am i down
Yea I'm all the way down we'll be fine
