I started from the bottom now im over here. Lookin down at my peers. Nigga they show respect which is why they dear. To me. Nigga I dont know how im suppose go on top without them. Nigga I rose from the grown like a seed to a stem. I know to me they a gem. Worth more than M's. I ain't gotta worry about no price. Nigga all I have to say is words are worthy like the lyrics I write. I know this game was out my reach. But now im over here making these rappers preach. I never talk cheap. Its a foreighn language to me. Like me speaking worthy. Its more money than shots of stephen curry. Because I dont give a fuck if these haters judge because they ain't my jury. I spit clean but my lyrics stay dirty. I never stop in the middle of my streak I finish fast like im in a hurry. I steal the show like a california burglary. I never lend to these haters. And nor will I offer. Like a new roster. I have little kids looking up to me like a for father. Because I started from the bottom now im over here. This is my year. Like I say every year. If you didn't hear. I ain't in the grammies yet but these fans give me a cheer. My goal is to be on top of the charts farther than the atmosphere. Im breathin in love lettin out the hate. After this mixtape. I will be called official the great. Im that nigga you will find a legend in my character trait. Like when the knicks had nate. Stuffin yao ming was just the beginning. Pretty soon you will see all these rappers loosing and I be doing is winning. I may be only a sophmore but in hip hop I'mma schola. Yo boy bring hip hop back like puttin hydraulics in a 6 4 impala. You new B's wouldn't understand. You think bitches shake it for you with some bands. We make em dance without dollars boy they hear our lyrics and its far more advanced. A higher level. I started from the bottom im over here. Later I'mma be on the highest peak of my career. Enough said I made these haters kiss my rear
