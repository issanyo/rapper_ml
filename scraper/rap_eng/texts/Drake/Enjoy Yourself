[Intro: Drake]
Yes yes y'all
Yes yes y'all
Yes yes y'all
I know that y'all impressed y'all
Yes yes y'all
Yeah you rocking with best y'all
Get it off my chest y'all

[Verse 1: Drake]
Jealousy’s something I haven’t felt for years
There’s nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love but damn
They just need to enjoy it
Try and make it better instead of trying to destroy it
And look this ain't a rap that’s talking bout all the dough you spent
This the so, so, so the Soul Movement!

[Verse 2: Slakah The Beatchild]
My brothers and, and, my ladies
We gonna take it back, to the days when De La souled it
By way of Marvin Gaye and Stevie, Tribe Called Quest unfolded
We chilled laid back on the block, bumping CL and my nigga Pete Rock
SWV had me weak for real, I’m a make you feel so good (yeah)

[Bridge: Slakah The Beatchild]
So when the beat drops we hop onto the floor
And when the beat stops we start banging the walls
When the walls fall we gone’ take it outside
And party till the stars and the moon collide

[Hook: Slakah The Beatchild]
Enjoy ya self, Enjoy ya self
Enjoy ya self, Enjoy ya self , Enjoy ya self

[Interlude: Drake]
Yes Yes Y'all, I know that yall impressed yall
Yes Yes Y'all, Yeah you rocking with the best yall

[Verse 3: Slakah The Beatchild]
My brothers and, and my ladies yeah oh
We need to take it back ‘cause now a days
There’s so much violence
That feel good real good vibe is gone
And it’s so hard to find it
Good times are gone and shattered
I thought that Family Matters
And it was A Different World
We were A-Team but now we’re scattered

[Bridge: Slakah The Beatchild]
So when the beat drops we hop onto the floor
And when the beat stops we start banging the walls
When the walls fall we gone’ take it outside
And party till the stars and the moon collide

[Hook: Slakah The Beatchild]
Enjoy ya self, Enjoy ya self
Enjoy ya self, Enjoy ya self , Enjoy ya self

[Interlude: Drake](2x)

[Alternate interlude: Slakah The Beatchild]
Come away and kick it kick it
Come away and dig it dig
Come away and kick it kick it
Come away and up life
