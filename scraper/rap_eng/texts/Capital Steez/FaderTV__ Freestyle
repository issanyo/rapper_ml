This chick wanna hit me up
Askin' when we get to fuck
These hoes want the quickest nut
Like a Jiffy Truck
I call em' over in a jiffy, Chuck
Addicted sluts
And she sell an ounce for like 60 bucks
So that means she got weight on deck
And a couple friends
But I wouldn't wait on that
Cause one thing that I hate, is why
I don't waist time
So I take mine
Roll green like snake eyes
Been observant
Focus, where the Purp is
Courteous, so I'm bout as high as the scratist
Ain't getting caught in and a quarter to a verdict
Know enough words to act ignorant on purpose
Shit, and I just blame hip-hop
From the home of Big Pop
So I won't diss Pac
Respect for one love
It's no lick shots
But I know some Haitian niggas that'll still pick locks
