Verse 1 (Monk): [?]

Bridge (Monk, Capital Steez): My cup filled, my cup cold
Just copped, I just rolled
Model chick, she at least a dime?
I say we children of the world, I say the world is mine

Verse 2 (Capital Steez): This cali grown got me hella blown
With my head up in the stars like a telescope
You could find me with a yellowbone
And she probably tryna get in the zone or somethin'
It's enticin' you got a bad temper like lightnin'
I never hit twice in the same spot
I suggest you stand back if you can't box
These Vans never even hit the skate shop
I'm on my bullshit, chillin' in a tank top
With like 3 bad bitches Baywatch
My bad, I don't really like degradin' women
But half these rappers ain't livin' how they say they livin'
The line between real and fake is now paper thin
And this is sucka free so at least try to pay attention
Or pay your dues, and don't make a move
It's Pay Per View, no Cablevision

Verse 3 (Monk): [?]
