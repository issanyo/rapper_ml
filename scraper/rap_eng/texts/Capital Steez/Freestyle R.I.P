[Freestyle: Capital STEEZ]
I said, "Whats the definition of real?"
I told 'em listen 'en chill
I ain't even got to mention this skill, because, STEEZ been ahead since he popped out the mamma's womb, and had it locked since they put me in my papa's tomb
I was three years old, so I really don't remember the day but I remember his face and every night I still remember to pray, and remember the little mistakes that made me spit it this way
It's like Taliban, when I'm droppin' bombs, goin' line for line spittin' this shit faster than Ramadan
When my pen sails, set sail
Any beat they put on, is gettin' smoked like Big L
We up on the rise like a cages
Cooley had nigga with the eyes of a Asian
Blazin', trapped in a mind full a hatred
Pops was a Rasta, and mom was a Pagan
My man had to get up out of this place, now he limpin' in PA, dog I'm happy your safe but... round here niggas die every day. I wouldn't lie to your face, come and light up a J man!
Said I got that whole town to hold down
What we get on; I blow down a whole pound, I know you see me shuttin' shows down
And we pickin' up hoes now. It's goin' down

[Outro]
-Let 'em know who you be  pimpin'
It's Capital STEEZ man
Ak-47, say no more
-That's what it is, John-John TV in the building?
I guess so, I mean, shoutout to the homie John-John we just did this show opening up for Mac Miller
It's crazy, my biggest performance yet
-That's real
It's world domination
