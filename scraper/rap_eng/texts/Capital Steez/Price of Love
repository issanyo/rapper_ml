[verse 1]:
To me you mean everything, I put that on everything, cuz you complete me, I wanna give you everything, from purses to diamond rings, you can be queen and i can be your king, I wanna buy you cars or even a star, introduce you to a couple of stars, hoping i make it far so you don't have to work, so you don't have to hurt, why you such a flirt? Be my ride or die, come on lets go and fly, shoot for the fuckin' sky, lets roll up and get really high, promise you'll never ever lie, promise you'll only be mine, you're so damn fine, all you do is shine, I looked in your eyes and i realized I'd worship you like a goddess or a holy-shrine, maybe you're the one, took one look and you left me stunned
[verse 2]:
Day dreaming about what we could be, maybe you could set me free, hearing your laugh is like hearing an angel sing, I'd do anything just to see you and me living happily, your personality is beyond belief, you've got a perfect smile so just say cheese, don't be shy, just take your time and we'll be fine, I don't have all in the world but girl I'll take care of that as long as you got my back I'll put us on the map, I'll top these charts and all you gotta do is steal my heart, I admire you like a fine piece of art, and all this shit is just the start. So lemme clear the air, I think that me and you are the perfect pair
[verse 3]:
You leave me paralyzed, all i can do is stare and i know you're aware that i honestly care, look in the mirror and it's clear that you're superior, now look me in the eyes and tell me the truth, do you really love me or do you love the money that I'm trynna make for us cuz lately you've been actin' up like you don't give a fuck, I miss the old times when I'd take you out to lunch, when you told me you love me so much, fuck it, i don't even give a fuck, that's the price of love. But I still hope it continues workin, and you don't leave me broken
