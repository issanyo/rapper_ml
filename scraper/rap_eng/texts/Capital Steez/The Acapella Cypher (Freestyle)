[Verse]
I said Steez had flow since back then when Kanye
Had the jaw brace, dark fade, backpacking it
Got it down packs since he came back with Heartbreaks
Rocking Aqua 8's and a jacket just to match with it
Who would've imagine years later just from spitting them lines
That I would be here picking up dimes, by the dozen
And homie if you think that I'm lying just ask my cousin
He asked if I could set him aside a couple
Burn paper, burn rubber, stretch plastic
Smashing then we dashing like New York traffic
I need a genie with the body like Jasmine
See we can get lifted off the purp like Aladdin
You would have thought it was Arabian laced
And lady you can stay the night, that's if you taking the pipe
I stick game like defense had to be retarded
If you didn't think Steez was working magic with the johnson
Now, we all stars like Taylor Gang
Say the name, wear the chain, only smoke paper planes
Kushed god, different colors like Bathing Apes
Tropicana orange juice when I wake and bake
But, it's all the same if you ask me
Jay Steez keep them bumping like acne
You know the team we run it like athletes
At track meets, and ain't nobody coming past me
Just a little younging passing them by
As a younging you could always see the passion in my eyes
To my momma, I'm sorry that I had to see you cry
But I'm chilling with homies and we lamping for the night
She said "Never let them niggas catch you slippin'And never give your all to these cold hearted bitches
As an infant you always been gifted with the mightest touch
Might as well use them gold caps for your protection
Cause I ain't ready for no grandson
You always been a womanizer like your dad was
I see you just trying to have fun
But it's hard to fight temptation when you tall, dark and handsome"
So can I hit in the morning, sun rising while you moaning
I'm going in, just tell me how you want it
Cause Steez he never kid like orphans and abortions
