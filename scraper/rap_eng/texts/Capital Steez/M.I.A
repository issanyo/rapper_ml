[Intro: Capital STEEZ]
See, don't mind if I do
I be a lock smith, be my accomplice
Mission impossible accomplished
I be a lock smith, be my accomplice
Mission impossible accomplished

[Hook: Junior Bell]
They say love is blind because sometimes you'll never know
But its a thing you'll find and you'll never want to let go
You got to free your mind, you got to see the signs
Open up your eyes, open up your eyes

[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]]
See, I'll admit that I don't know what love is
I still tend to use the word like in the wrong sense
The best thing I had I was in a rush to throw away
It ended on a note with nothing more to say
Let alone drop the pot try to make it far
Old mistakes, we want it all but on a larger plate
I learned too late and can't have her
I brought the silver platter but its like you never matter
Now we can do the unthinkable
My mind's post grad but my heart's back in middle school
People say moving on is always the hardest thing to do
Because even then I'mma think of you
My one and only, you're the first of many
The best I ever had or the worst of plenty
But if I had a second chance I would be a better man
Just to insure that yah won't forget me
I never knew a love like this
So there's no way id give it up that quick
And each day i learn a bit about my self
So, disregard all this confidence, see
We all do it, we're all human
And I don't know it all so we can walk through it
And I know sometimes I talk foolish
If you have the slightest doubt in me, then I'll prove it
I lost love so what's left to lose?
What's next to prove is when I'm next to you
That I'm a better man, and I'm far from perfect
I'm just hoping you'd accept it too
And if not, I can't blame you for that
I gave you more than enough reasons not to take me back
But on the same note there's a reason to try again
I understand you don't have to invite me in
When you tried I shut it down quick and early
We both know how I handled things immaturely
One thing I learned about love is no matter what they say
Picture perfect is never certain
Women learn faster then men do
But this is something I would gladly rekindle, see
You probably thinking this was easy to write
But the first two went through half of my pencil
Love isn't a crime and it can build the most simple of minds
If it's given with time and this is all I can give you of mine
A piece of my heart and if you didn't wanna listen it's fine
This is all i can give you of mine
And if you didn't wanna listen its fine
So I'mma just sit and rewind
Reminiscing because you're just another victim of time
