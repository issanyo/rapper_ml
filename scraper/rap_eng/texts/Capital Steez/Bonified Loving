[Intro]
So come fly with me, bitch

[Verse 1]
You got a man and I know you can't leave him
But I know you met me for a reason
Him and I are two different extremes so I know what they mean by people in seasons
You in a hot-cold relationship
And you really don't know what to think of it
But I think you need to take a risk
Cause a girl like you needs a man like me
Me, I know people in high places
That's the only reason I've been up on hiatus
Sky scrapin', big city livin', so trust me I rock stages outrageous
I know you can't offer much, and
These little niggas like to talk too much
But I can tell they be calling a bluff
So I don't see the harm in you callin me up

[Hook]
What you need is some bonafide lovin
I could make you feel like a grown ass woman
No problem, take it how you want it
I can take you overseas, for I'm over my budget
What you need is some bonafide lovin
I could make you feel like a grown ass woman
First, it's the finer things
And that's only if you with it, so make your decision

[Verse 2]
It sound like you torn in the middle
Like you getting on with more than a little
Tell him he ain't forced to be with you
Maybe he'll get the bigger picture if it's drawn with a stencil
I'm Leonardo or Pablo Picasso
You're Mona Lisa with the smile of a model
Pick a place, we can fly there tomorrow
But your man tryin' to drive over pot holes
He oughta get left
We off that, then we on to the next
You rockin' with the best, boardin' a jet
And you already mentioned youâ€™re bored with the sex
He got you a promise ring
I got diamonds and all kinds of bling
But first, it's the finer things
And that's only if you with it
So make your decision

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Girl, if um, I were you then, I would choose that
I gotta move cuz tou got a man, and um
He's kinda slippin', but you stickin with him, and
That's your decision, decision
Girl, if, I were you then I would choose that
I gotta move cuz, you got a man, and I
Know I ain't helpin, but
You can't be selfish, cuz
It's either him or me, so
Girl, if... I were you then...
I'm talkin shit right now...
And I'll still probably fuck yo bitch nigga! Swag!
I'm sorry Based God!
Kinda dissed you and shit
But I'll still probably fuck yo bitch nigga

[Hook]
