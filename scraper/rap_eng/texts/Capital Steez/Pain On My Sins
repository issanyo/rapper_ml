[Intro: Capital STEEZ]
The only mission is get paid
Ever since 5th grade the STEEZ been as sharp as a switchblade
Had the Will Smith fade
And a Swiss made army knife
Just in case the nigga trynna start a fight

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
The only mission is get paid
Ever since 5th grade the STEEZ been as sharp as a switchblade
Had the Will Smith fade
And a Swiss made army knife
Just in case the nigga trynna start a fight
But that was back when I could hardly write
And my niggas nowadays getting caught up in the party life
I couldn't ride a bike or fly a kite
Now I'm blowing up like dynamite and swinging like I am Mike
With a Pacquiao boxing style or Cool J in '91 when
Mama said that i came out
Beat headphones, the hating I just block it out
The half-cabs the same color as a crocodile
So you can catch me in the flyest pair
We straight shittin' on 'em, so It's the time of year
Bad boy baby, put me in the highest chair
You would need mountain-gear just to climb up here
