[Verse 1:Capital STEEZ]
Imma' need quarto of those
Three packs of the Oreos
And two cigarillos just to warm us up before the show
And 94 said there's no love for the hoes
So we spark em' up
And they wonder where the water goes
It's funny how now they think they know me
Cause it's 4-5-6 like the dice was always loaded
Catch me with The Prodies straight fire when we rolling
G coded, so who's supplying them anchovies
I switched styles and them niggas still bitin'
I take a  pie nock back forty seven slices
I decided that I would let my mind get high on Psilocybin and
Couldn't stop rhyming
Ayo Chuck, let em' know what the time is
I think I just found a whole ’noth·er island
Fly said the ladies are private but they blinded
And need a couple guys to open up their eyelids

[Hook]
It's the dawning of the new age we too blazed
Call us the unlimited crusade
But for right now we got it on lock
So I'll be smoking out till' doomsday
It's the dawning of the new age we too blazed
Call us the unlimited crusade
The Beastcoast we got it on lock
So I'll be munching out till' doomsday

[Verse 2: Chuck Strangers]
What's the good word
Niggas blazing that herb
Take a puff and I learn
If I rap then I earn
Strong arming niggas y'all don't even get a turn
I'm calling your bitch cause I know she wanna burn
And all we do is flex on the weekend (flex on the weeknd)
You've been leaking eyes even when I'm leavin'
But she felt good about it cause a nigga wasn't schemin'
With a nine millimeter I ain't talking 'bout no heater
We snapping bongs on yo front lawn
Fuck is going on
Tippers mourning to the law
[?]
But it's right, This is that internal fight
My niggas taking flight so you're up now
Smoking in my mamma's crib
Guess it's how real niggas is
I'm in my Jordan's and my gold chain living it up
Niggas over on my side not giving it up
Highs low when I spot you
These eighths cost fifty but I got you

[Hook]
It's the dawning of the new age we too blazed
Call us the unlimited crusade
But for right now we got it on lock
So I'll be smoking out till' doomsday
It's the dawning of the new age we too blazed
Call us the unlimited crusade
The Beastcoast we got it on lock
So I'll be munching out till' doomsday

[Verse 3: Rokamouth]
I got seven grams ready off the play
And we 'gon smoke an ounce to this and feel great
And even got enough to puff an 1/8 to the face
If we need a re-up I need some [?]
Friends building trust like us we roll jays
And I'm putting out that word, new ways to get paid
Cause out in New York, East coast we smoke heavy
Got the flower of life to flow out my mind steady
Smoking the [?]
The most who ain't ready
Doomsday coming 'gon be stunting in my Chevy
These American dreams turn into schemes
And all I'm 'gon need is my weed with no seeds
Rolling the fronto leaf to smoke it with Ali

[Hook]
It's the dawning of the new age we too blazed
Call us the unlimited crusade
But for right now we got it on lock
So I'll be smoking out till' doomsday
It's the dawning of the new age we too blazed
Call us the unlimited crusade
The Beastcoast we got it on lock
So I'll be munching out till' doomsday
