(Fuck a 9 to 5)
Lately ive felt like a failure
I'm just looking for a manager
Even if I have to lie,Cheat,And Steal
Cause my hearts been heavy and
I've been hung like a horse put me in the deli and that's a big pun Dominick I'ma join em but not till I close my eyelids I've been down a bit cause I don't want no 9 to 5 but I don't want to commit a crime for real with a ski mask and I ain't sking when I running running from the cops I yell deuces I want to blow up sitting home watching it's always sunny in Philadelphia but help me out. (Cause I don't to be a loose cannon running round)
