[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
Loose slacks let me know who Cap is
I'm way too smooth for that shit
Roll 3 spliffs they cool and passive
But watch as we cruise in traffic
Like g shit though I hate police
Reconstruction, we pave the streets
We progressive the name is STEEZ
Capital first like bank receipts
If I take a piece then of course she gon' want seconds
I ain't stepping out of my element cause my mind is my only weapon
...47...
Like doctors say you could fuck around get in shot today
Ever since my home boy passed away
It's been rebirth and intoxicate
Lumberjacks roll the Philly
Bump the track so I know you feel me
Shake that shit girl don't be silly
And got the fire place when it's cold and chilly
So let me warm you up
Animal planet we gonna uhh
Back it up like a Tonka truck
And I'mma roll one more blunt
..........STEELO
