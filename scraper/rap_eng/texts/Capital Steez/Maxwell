Love you and leave you lost
Will you forgive me?

[Verse 1: Dirty Sanchez]
Stop wit' all the grieving
Love or hate? Whatta do you believe in?
You can have my heart just take it or leave it
Give it all for one?
One for old time sake
I know you heard 'em talking bout
How them old times great
So we should, take it back to the 99 days
P.S. I'll be your sunshine and you can be rays
I've feelin' this way too long for it to be a phase, page or chapter
So let's skip to the happily ever after
Please, dreams of fame? You still my biggest fantasy
We're connected, I'ma Cancer see
It's not a tough question at all
Can I call you? Just answer me, just answer me
Goldilocks I can be your Big Papa, bear wit' me
I'll bare the light if you'll share the sticky
And I don't wanna break up
Aight, you still with me?
Short term or long term
You can't forget me, a G

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
I guess I gotta say this shit in Spanish
Like girl let 'em know who your man is
Tried to use my manners, you didn't want a companion
Fuck if I'm sexist, sex is what keep you guessin'
And I probably got you stressin' when I'm not up in your section
But you can find me in dimensions
Tryna out source the last girl to make my head spin
Old chickens wanna ask "How the ex been?"
Trust they all bitches, caught slippin' for attention
Say she gotta be wilding with respect
If you diming it wit' neck
Get a diamond on your necklace
She can't swallow, that's the Tylenol-effect
Knocking 'em all down, Domino affection
Yeah I got some trust issues
But I want the lust tissues
Enough to fuck with you
Like, I know it hurts, but you love the way it tickles
So I guess it's safe to say you in a pickle

[Verse 3: Rokamouth]
Ya, uh, and I won't forget you
And I don't regret you
Even though I wasn't on your mind
At times, I missed you
And still appreciate all the times we been through
Just dealing wit' yo mind, such a complex mental
Wit' a smile so fine, I wanna finer dental
I know her curves well, used to draw her stencil
When she sharp my pencil, always was so efficient with the things we do to..
But she always seeing different, I'm committed wit' you
How we started off friends in the middle of school
Now I'm touching her heart from inside of this booth
Reaching out to them stars, like how she wanted us too
So even though I love, lost, can I hit it on you?
And I know you won't front, cause you know how I do
So can I show you what's gone, when I give you that ouuu
Cause only me and you!
