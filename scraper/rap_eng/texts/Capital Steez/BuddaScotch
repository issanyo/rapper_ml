[Verse 1: MONK]

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
This cali grown got me hella blown
With my head up in the stars like a telescope

You can probably find me with a yellowbone
And she probably trying to get in the zone or something
It's enticing, he got a bad temper like lightning
He never hit twice in the same spot
I suggest you stand back if you can't box
These Vans never even hit the skate shop
I'm on bullshit chillen in a tank-top
With like 3 bad bitches, Baywatch
My bad, I don't really like degrading women
But half these rappers ain't living how they say they living
The line between real and fake is now paper thin
And this is sucker free, so at least try to pay attention
Or pay your dues, and don't make a move
It's pay-per-view, no cablevision
