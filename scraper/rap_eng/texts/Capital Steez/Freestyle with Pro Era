[Verse 1: Wati Heru]
I'm cuntvinced cuntcieted bitches be the first to get they cunt seeded
Birth cuntrol, its cuntfusing how she cuntceived it
It's a cuntspicuous cuntspiracy how cunt scheming
Running like cross country, just to get the cunt creamin'
Cuntinuously on the hunt for cunt
Seemed in a daze, cuntsidering giving cunt semen
Saying he’ll never get cuntrolled by the cunt demon
He contradicted, he’s cunt addicted, cause cunt see men
It's cuntroversial, there's cuntsequences cause the cunt could hurt you
So listen to your inner cuntscious, observe the cunt circle
After approving cuntact, view how the cunt act, no prenup cuntract
Usual cunt trap, it's terrible
Pare into the parable, especially if you cuntstillate
If she know you a star and the cunt still late for monthly visits
If mother nature could cuntcentrate she cuntstiplates the cunts debate
If it's worth the cake
If you don't pay the cuntstible a cuntinue to give another case
Can't be cunent in cunt tent if you not making papes
Who said that this is a mans world need to get it straight
Pussy is power nigga, respect the cuntglomerate

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
It's kinda scary though
Yo bro, peep the scenario
We had the tabs, fire, and the shrooms like Mario
This peach sumchin trying to shake their tail
You can tell, I wasn't really funking with the smell
She had a pill, but the pill had her slipping
Fly nigga with a wingspan, we can't pay attention
My nigga's bong ripping so of course we on a different floor
Hits, I started dozin' off for a minute
And then I went back to the vision
Of when I seen how they have blacks in division
Can't crack through the system
That's why we got crack through your system
Now we got the matrix hacked with precision
And that's a new flow for all you putos
Tryna to compare fools gold to Acapulco's

[Verse 3: Dirty Sanchez]
My niggas always high, they barely buyin'
Weed [?] broke my scale, I got a [?] and the pots frying
Blunts healthy, mommy so sick
I'm insulted, throw the pussy back, catapult it
More cushion for the pushing, don't get comfortable kid
My ego's altered, dirty money in the vault and
Niggas ain't safe in fact they ship shapes, switching plates
Via snakes, fuck it
I don't know what else to say, popping off the top of the dome
It's the [?] my nigga, we taking it home
From Brooklyn to fuckin', I don't even know Rome
It could be anywhere else in the fucking Earth, the globe
You don't understand what we doing, changing the whole view
Of the people, I don't give a fuck if you got flu
You're not sicker than me, who the fuck are you
Pro Era crew, Beast Coast, BC, I don't know
I'm not doing what you thinking, but I'm getting my paper
Fuck all of that shit, I'm just thinking
Later I'mma see, how we gonna handle the rest of the haters, fuck it
Anybody else wanna see the Beast

[Verse 3: Wati Heru]
Freestyling in the cypher that's my, specialties
Started when I was two years old, especially
After 8 Mile, nigga saw that shit and straight whylin'
Can't fool him, freestyling ever since that mother was on the island
Came through rap, he was a child then
Out in Staten, came through, back to Manhattan
Different shit, get the sentences, get the stats in
Niggas couldn't get the chick I like stat, got the ratchet
Nigga was acting ratchet like, Worldstar shit
Ya you know, he was on the world nigga, Worldstar shit, nigga
Take a torch nigga, rose on the torch nigga
On some tribes and quests, try to quest nigga
Like the tribes nigga, try to digest nigga
This is Q-Tip abstract, nigga get that ass back
Nigga, I make your girl do ass laps
She came, she threw that ass back, damn
I didn't know what she doing, and then she got fluent
I influence influences every time that I do it
It's so sick, it's like ahh-choo
When I bless you with these heckler rhymes
Y'all niggas couldn't step to mine

[Verse 4: Dirty Sanchez]
It's the Brooklyn representative
No artificial intelligence
Just thinking in light, haven't even taken flight yet
I know you feel me, pull out your camcorders
Thousand ounces just bordered, you see your change it's just my hora
Over time, I became a reflection of brains
Cash, Mary Jane, what did I forget to mention
Well, fat blunts since the age of fifteen
Y'all smoke toothpicks, I pick the steak out of my teeth
Bon-Appetit, I'd rather be home sick, then homesick
Plastic cups with Robatussin keep me posted like Big's
Not budging or moving, I can't run it of [?]
Don't blink till you reach the top, keep up with stairs
No competition, fuck it I'm just doing this, no dissing
But, my conglomerate's influenced lots of niggas missing
Everything they had, and their fucking heart and passion
After that it's all old my nigga

[Verse 5: Racks]
Looking at this money make me want to make some more of it
Put me on these tracks and I bet a nigga slaughter it
[?] on some harder shit, that's because I'm hard as shit
Presidential holding clips, nigga I ain't sparing of shit
Racks been on these tracks like a runner on his racing kit
Indiana pacing it, smoking as I lace a hit
Dealing with that stress will make a pussy nigga slit his wrists
Police come and line me up, but fuck a pig I never snitch
Cause I be on some gangster shit like shooting up your mama shit
Been shooting up but I'm still allowed at they mama crib
