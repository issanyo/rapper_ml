[Verse 1: Capital Steez]
(Soul searchin') 'till my flows are perfect
I ain't trynna be a slave to grow old from workin'
Sorry BADA$$, you lucky that I peeped it second
Tell them niggas keep it steppin' with they beat selection
Check the melodies, it's so heavenly
That shit'll get your hipster move with no 7D's
Audi-opium, can I bust soliloquies
Got that shit mix and mastered both remedies
Grab a spoonful, we servin' up a pot
And you know we gotta serve it while it's hot
I'm flowin' like a volcano, I'm drippin' verses off the top
Dirty cops still swervin' on the block
Lookin' for black kids, that spittin' up acid
It's in my jeans so don't worry what my pants is
Get with the script it's that ignorant shit
And we bound to get sick of it quick and I ain't sealin' my lips
It's the shift, I know you feel it man
We blowin' up like a ceiling fan
Droppin' off jewels like Killa Cam's man
When it comes to kickin' verses I'm Mr. Van Damme
Crushin' strawberry, it's the jam
So throw up both hands if you can
Ironic how I'm killin' this shit, until they bury me
My volume is going in depth with longevity
Stupid
