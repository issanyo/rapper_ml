[INTRO]

Blow me a check (yeah) x4
Blow a check x2
Blow me a check (yeah) x2

[HOOK]

Blow me a check and I'm flexing
Put me in a bentley already
Drop top coupe and I'm swerving
Give you nightmares , call me freddy! [x2]

[VERSE 1]

Sharp shooter d wade
Rich nigga bruce wayne
Lean lean take my chest pain !
O.D. thats cobain
Pop bottles champagne
Smoking that maryjane
Heavy strain play her like a game
Switching lanes on the freeway
Shawty blow my line,but the call decline
Take my side to dine,snort lines off her spine
Hit the play rewind
Start it all from scratch
Now the time is mine
Now the time is mine!

[HOOK]

Blow me a check and I'm flexing
Put me in a bentley already
Drop top coupe and I'm swerving
Give you nightmares , call me freddy! [x2]

[VERSE2]

Won't ever catch me red handed
Two sides main entree can't stand it
Get away with murder,you can call me dexter
Seem to find my ways,always like an expert
Jay steez gonn' give you,mothafuckas a lesson

[HOOK]

Blow me a check and I'm flexing
Put me in a bentley already
Drop top coupe and I'm swerving
Give you nightmares , call me freddy! [x2]
