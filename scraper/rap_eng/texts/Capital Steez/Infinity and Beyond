[Intro]

Rest in peace R.I.O.T
Say I owe him a verse for this
So Ima give him a verse for this
And I ain't gotta rehearse this shit

[Verse 1]
I got em asking what I'm going do next
Probably find me riding with McFly on a photo jet
"Why you ain't go solo yet?"
Idontknow?, I just ain't planned to lose my manz for no wrote off checks
But, damn, we still ain't make a cent
Bout to leave high school and moms gotta pay the rent
Plus she climbing outta major debt
So it shows that you never too old to take baby steps
But I was used to them hard lessons
This rap shit came along as an odd blessing
My best man told me "aim for the stars brethren
I'll be riding shotty, so start revvin' them car engines"
From Illmatic to Villematic, dance songs pop, but real rappers is still at it
I don't even think a deal matter, because when the fame come, you just another pill addict
And, that's a genre I refuse to represent
The next option is rendezvous with elegance
If your collars blue you're probably used to standing at a desk for eight hours
And opted out to selling bricks
And then come selfishness
But I don't planned to quit until every single shelf is hit
And when I try to pull myself to quit, I'm more in it for fans than I'm in it for me
"Yo, STEEZ, you know you nice dawg, you killin' them beats and
I'm really wishing I could send you a beat, and you need to get on some industry beats
And that girl you wrote a song, is she letting you beat?"
Woah, hold up dawg, you can't be serious?
You really think I fell off from lyricism?
Tell these cats the top dawg is in the kitchen
Cooking up tracks and this time you better listen
Cause if you ain't noticed yet, we growin vets and we still ain't broke a sweat
Blowing dust off of old cassettes
It just hasn't been the same since my homie's death
You little niggas hold no respect
Thinking that you gotta hold a tech to pose a threat
I told you I'm focused man
It's point game, no assist, and I'm going in, said I'm going in

[Chorus]
This is how we chill from '93 til
This is how we chill from '93 til
This is how we chill from '93 -- til infinity and beyond
This is how we chill from '93 til
This is how we chill from '93 til
This is how we chill from '93 -- til infinity and beyond
