Uhhh, uhuhuhuuh, uhuhuhuh
Uhuhh...

[Verse]

Pay attention to this canvas
While I paint you this campus
Where niggas learn how to survive and take chances
The youth missing classes no hallpasses
It's shots expelling niggas for good So tragic
Wanna be the baddest? Homie you can have it
I'm grown with a very rare set of circumstances
Got everything to lose what I have wasn't handed
Why you think I'm in the crib praying like mantis?
I damage anything In between me and growth
Loyalty, love and honor we abide by the oath
Don't let them tell you that you can't shine when you broke
Cause only genuine souls can survive through the smoke
I ride to the Ghost Gangster and a Gentleman
I'm young but I'm wise man you playing with a veteran
And fuck being good enough I'm tryna' be better than
It's no excuses when we got a black president
I'm bringing you a element that ya'll can admire
Think I'm fly I know a little girl Flyer
Anyiah Simone, that's who I want The best for
Living every day like a move on a chessboard
Don't serve purpose than its worthless
Fuck a club fuck a bitch I rather write verses
Ride through Berckman on a L ride
And shed tears cause the same corner that we all love
Where Miguel died
Now tell me how I'm supposed to feel?
When the trouble getting close forreal
And you know what's ill?
Niggas out here high wildin out taking life
And it ain't even ova bills. Smoke and pills
It went from selling to just using
Then they got the nerve to be shooting
You clown ass niggas
Wanna be down ass niggas
Gon' die in the town ass niggas
Fuckin' stupid. Make a nigga wanna fuckin' lose it
But I kill'em with success and that white thing fuckin ruthless
It's all g. Hope when you saw me
If I was giving out game you took it It's all free
Y'all be so lame no goals and no aim
While we tryna penetrate the game
Ain't in it for the fame or no bad bitch
Just wanna get mad rich
Take the fam out the hood and make classics
It's to the point I can't take no more
Hate work and I really can't wait no more
Can't play no more can't stray no more
From the plan and everything we supposed to take by storm
It's do or die and I won't stop
Til they put me in a cold box
And the funeral home sold out
And you can see all of the hearts I touched
I tell my niggas don't cry, just spark a dutch
Remember all the good times and even the bad
Days we was way up or down to our last
We still waved on em'. Switched lanes on em'
Woodland to the High fresh every day on em'
And tell my mother that she raised one hell of a man
That's why our bond how it is they could never understand
I just wanna see you stress free
And bless you the same way you blessed me
No doubt and to my fam' you the best, thanks for the support
Your love is priceless, it could never be bought
Always cared, always helped just to see me straight
So know I'm good now every time you see my face
To the apple of my eye, the only sequel of I
When I'm gone, just know I'm by your side
You the air I breathe, you the blood I bleed
And when my lights get low, you all I see
We been low, been high but we always been good
So of course shit is still going as it should
Baby I know our life ain't perfect
But as long as you here it's all worth it
And that's real don't it feel like soul food
Prepare meals on the protools
Hot plates but he so cool
Looking at em' like I told you
Just to be this sincere is a gift we should toast to
Sippin' on Henny Mad jokes cause we all silly
Young Gods from a small city
And we All 50
X2 that's why I trust my crew
No matter what I know that ya'll with me
And I just wanna' play my part
Get Some burn give em' hell and make my mark
I swear to God yo the chips near
My nigga you just gotta ride til we get there

One Love...
