[Verse 1: SMTH]
Now what y'all wanna do
Wanna be, centamese Smitty Corleone on his Steez
Grinding all week, same shit on the weekend
If life is a pool then I'm jumping off the deep end
Peep my back stroke, hit it till her back broke
She gave me head lock, make that kitty cat choke
Shawty I'm the man, more dapper then Dan
Say my name twice like Duran Duran
The law of the land, got the world through my hands
Tony Montana, no coke, just rhyming grammar
Dodging the slammer, they say I'm guilty by my skin tone
But I've never been to jail, yea I've been home
Non-authentic, y'all been cloned, no maid lays a plate, play kid I've been grown
Now let me demonstrate, I've never been afraid
Man you fucking with a renegade
I'm eons beyond whatever you rather be on
Smoother than Billy D, yea I'm cooler than Freon
I'm major,these perpetrators are about to get exposed
Contemplating on what the ? a rhythm to my soul
Let them know please somebody let them know
You going against the grain, boo that's the wrong way to go
I'm too legit to quit, we ain't moving on the same route
For my units in the mix,, wear you better stay out
Any issue my riders will come and get you
My clique is official, they never tickle
They breaking bone bristles
I hear a lot of talking when I turn my back
But when I turned around, they don't say jack
U better just lay flat, we don't ask we just take that
Know some killas that will kill you for 8 stacks
Mentality of a run away salve, we alive but we digging our own grave

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
I said hats off and let this be the last straw
I'm sick and tired of having to sneak in through the back door
Scratch that I'm sick of tired of being sick of tired
How you not going to give me mine, every time I rip a line
I haven't seen the limelight, in a right mind
Rappers base their careers off of white lies
A ghost writer been why he so nice
And the time he spit some of his lines it's no concept
Your not sick you're looking for a day off
And I'm losing sight of the game, call me Ray Charles
Got me thinking i should try to go AWOL
And randomly slide into first so lets play ball
I stand ready with a Louisville Slugger
And a great amount of courage that few could still muster
Cause I'm nice, and I was poised to shine
Grab ur aviator shades keep your pupils still covered
People still love it, cause I'm showing differences
The difference is when it spit I'm actually making sense
Stay synonymous to syllabic lyricists
Looking for radio play and then making hits
Non-conformity what all of you conforming to
Your fan base is screaming death of the auto tune
I would form crowds if I was inaudible
And rap losing out, so I choose to applaud the few
Who stay part of it, didn't become narcissists
That beef about cars, whips and insufficient arguments
I order these celebrities who are pouring cries
And probably get their lines from a starter kit to get the bars to spit
Super heroes with drape capes and face paints
Putting stars in check, fake Bapes
Grab your AKs, we're looking for some weight slaves
When we drop we bring the dynamite, JJ
I been here to provide them facts
But you like sing-a-longs and campfire raps
The difference between you and I is that
I can rap and I don't brag about designer bags
Besides the fact that these guys are whack
It took me 15 minutes just to write this track
Tell me how you liking that, bitch
