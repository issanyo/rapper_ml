The lyrics will be completed upon the release of "King Capital". Stay tuned

[Verse: Capital STEEZ]
Peep the last joint I close 'em all in the compound
Tell them other cats we got a hurricane in town
Thought Hip-Hop was dead, now we breaking grounds
Zombies where my heart beats march free
My mum raised a nigga now we don't raise harm, we raise arms calmly
The soundwaves like tsunamis
Sure hits, fuck Billboard hits
I don't need the Gold/Diamond to spit raw shit
I don't need blood diamonds to feel more rich
Just for kicks, if you shining I'll steal your kicks
So who 'gon stop us if poverty can't
Then gives us time [?]
[?] quality man
I got drive, niggas couldn't walk a mile in these Vans
Wordplay meets first aid
So good with the verbs it was almost stainless
Realized I was a genius
And stopped giving a fuck 'bout my third grade teacher
They said I lack the pedigree
But now with great penmanship I'm shitting on the industry
So homie what you telling me
It's power to the trinity and death to the industry
