{Emancipated from mental slavery that's word to my rastas
Cell blocked mind so I got my head locked up
My third eye chakra was blocked and a flash from the cops
Made this indigo path that I follow that's word to my father
Watch when the babylon pass, gotta stash in my basketball pants
Gotta enough fire to light up a whole camp
I an I never thought to inspire a grown man}

{Progression is the basis with eleven different phases
The faces of the Moon cause the Earth to start shaking
They say it's our world for the taking and Imma win it all for my girl and my vaccant  lately I've been thinking since it's dried up like raisins
The system's like bud when we break it
A slim foundation were undeveloped seeds in the middle
That's why they really need an individual
So I guess we them niggas and we setting up the villains for the rest of you niggas
Deny? Nigga I'm the best don't forget it .....all It it took was 13 steps and I did it}

{And today I got a feeling that I’ve never felt
And I don’t know what I don’t know what I don’t know what to say And today I got a feeling like not before
And I guess I can’t I guess I can’t I guess I can’t explain}

{We was born to be a step ahead shit they got the system doing systems we got the system that turned us into Victims my moms was living with 8 children and section 8 is still trying to evict them
Said look at the world we’re here living in
I’m too proud to blend it in with law abidin citizens
It’s cuz I’m black is it.. and the characteristics of your last statistic
Massa said I couldn’t define happiness and my master said I couldn’t pass as a pacifist
I dealt with more bank than the Mexicans did
Ion back tears like a handkerchief}

{I said I wanna be a rap star
Porn stars, black cars and fast cars
Fuck Ferrari”s bacardi and parties I wanna change the world I'm awfully sorry
And I can even be the next Bob Marley, Marcus Garvey or Mahatma Gandhi
And follow MLK steps back like scotty when we step towards greatness
And I still haven’t found my placement
Cuz hip hop hasn't made a leap of faith yet}

{And today I got a feeling that I’ve never felt
And I don’t know what I don’t know what I don’t know what to say
And today I got a feeling like not before
And I guess I can’t I guess I can’t I guess I can’t explain }
