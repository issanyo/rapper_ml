[Verse]
You see we be the illest thing in the starter cap
Roger that cause off the back we got alot to offer rap
Split decision lyricism got us spitting venom
With sick delivery sharp tounges and quick precision
Tock-tick, he's toxic when phonics hit
Overly confident, flow atomic with vomitspit
The rhetoric is effortless yet errorless
So every french kiss is a deathwish with severred lips
Egh! I'm at a loss for words
My thought's reserved for an awesome verse
If I split several soliloquies with eloquence
You'll have to admit, I'm the rawest you heard
Charming with words, even though I ain't heard alot
I aim for the pant sagging youth, call me urban cops
I mastered palavers cause cat's ain't on my caliber
If you plans involving catching up, I urge you to stop
That's off the top
