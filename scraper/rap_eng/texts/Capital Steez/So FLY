[Verse 1: CJ Fly]
Concord Grape Juice on a Concorde
Done lots of birds but she acting like a condor
Something like my money I'll pile it
I'm ill printed born way before july 6th
Just got up i have no more risk disguises
Cook it only if you let me in then i eye-ject
The way your body shaking so seismic
Gave you my heart and other parts but that's private
That means I wasn't in my mommy's tummy
So much paper all around me got me feeling like a mummy
Just terrific, lyrics was written in hieroglyphics
Copped two O's and 7
Now i'm feeling like i'm on a mission
I'm like a runway plane just tryna get lifted
On cloud 9 without reefer in my system
Fly like a hero though I'm chilling like a villain
Closed like a sealant up like a ceiling
If i say it's going down just be sure to have your parachute
She give me lots of head i call her betty botter
Airport its like my fortress
In the air force but never wearing air forces
With a flow like a faucet
Yo STEEZ take the L man tell that we forfeit
Tell em that we forfeit
And let Joey be the one to talk shit

[Chorus: CJ Fly]
So fly
So fly
So fly
So damn fly

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Alright
This the part where I come in?
Alright cool
Check, I'm ancient y'all niggas ain't shit
Don't sleep I'm too anxious just to make it
Nigga, and I don't like waiting
But I hold weight like obese patients
It's amazing still but eat like racious
Tell 'em save a piece for beast with no training
Eyes got Asian and gray started fading
But blame it on the blood it's Jamaican I'm just saying
So now likkle yout roll mad trees
Don't forget the doobie doo like Daphne
Word from the wise nigga
Step aside 'cause son is on the rise
Wake up and smell the caffeine
I'm the best there is if you ask me
I stay paraxial
Still keep em' bumping like acne
And just another youngin' he should call them twice
I know niggas who sold they soul just so they could hold their life
Just because they grew up didn't know their rights
Now they in the pen cause they tryna fight couldn't control the riot
This for y'all in rike all my wrongs all my rights
R.I.P. to all my niggas who saw the heat got iced
World is not nice... yeah...... nigga

[Break: Joey Bada$$]
(yo steez get ur fat ass over here hahahaha)

[Verse 3: Capital STEEZ]
All I need is uhh
Mary Jane, a paper and pen
If infatuations a sin please say it again
And if our world is filled with good people
Then why we fall victim to the root of all evil?
Yeah my mind's set on fly shit
But my mindset is more on that Marley and Nas tip
You ain't fly yet boy you's an ostrich
I left the coup like Corvettes in '96
And I fly to it birds of a feather
We fly all winter I ain't scared of the weather
Listen, niggas been winning since the beginning
And there's no telling who gon' be with me in the ending
PE's here and we lifted
Call us Popeye, got a pipe and that spinach
Eyes can't open so I rather leave 'em squinting
Then I knock out by the time that it kicks in
Where the loud pack? Gotta have teen spirit
Where that loud pack? Gotta have team spirit
So fly every time I serve a bar
That's a tax right or if she's a motherfucking stewardess
I'm way over heads
Double entendre could you say it again
Could you say it again
Could you say it again
