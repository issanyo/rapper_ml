[Intro]
Cause when they try to shoot starts down
I'm sure to fall on to soft ground
I won't let y'all down you give me your all mom
Look at your boy now
Said look at your boy now, just look at your boy now
If you put yourself in my position
Then you would understand both sides

[Verse]
Dear Mama, your boy has become a man now
I got it from here so you can stand down
As a grown woman you should understand how
Things don't always work how they planed out
Seventeen you were doing big things
So why is it hard for me to chase my dreams
Very few of them are made like Steez
You always had your boy cut straight like seams
I walk this way in my Adidas
First check I spent on buying sneakers
Being method, I got to supply the reefer
Now I'm falling behind from trying to keep up
I know that you probably right
But you got to understand I'm at the time of my life
Where I'm too hardheaded for my Mama's advice
But I promise you it won't stop tonight
Got to get my priorities straight
Invest a few hundred in recording a tape
But instead I went and bought me a eighth
And the cops have to enforce the laws that man makes
Cause it's my mistake and I'am fix it
They say I'm way too gifted for getting lifted
Just another statistic convicted
93 so my soul in the mischief
But if I maintain these clean records
I can take on the world with these records
What don't kill you only make you stronger
Or stranger Rest in Peace to Heath Ledger
Learning how serious life is
Reminiscing the minutes to experience it twice
I been the flyest Still in the flight with Riot
And thats till I close my eyelids

(outro)
All I need is a kickdrum
A mic, pad, an index and a thumb (2x)
All I need is, all I need is, all I need is
A kick and a drum
All I need is a, all I need is a, all I need is a
If you put yourself in my shoes you could see what its like to live a day in the life
If you put yourself in my position then you would understand both sides
Love you
93 till infinity..
