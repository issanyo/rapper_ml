(2:38-3:21)

Yo
STEELO!

(Verse)
Emancipated from mental slavery
That's word to my Rastas
Cell block mind so I got my head locked up
My third eye chakra was blocked
The flash from the cops made us indigo
Path that I followed, that's word to my father
Watch a babylon pass, got a stash in the basketball pants
Got enough fire to light up a whole camp
I an I never thought I inspired a grown Man
So progression is the basis, eleven different phases
The faces of the Moon cause the Earth to start shaking
They said it's our world for the taking
So I'mma win it all for my girl, and my bacon
Lately I been thinking, since it's up dried like raisins
And the system's like buds when we break it
A slim foundation with undeveloped seeds in the middle
That's why they really need a individual...
So I guess we the biggest and we setting up the villains for the rest of them niggas
(the night has gone) The best don’t forget it
All I did was 13 steps and I did it

(Hook)
And today – I got a feeling that I’ve never felt
And I don’t know what – I don’t know what – I don’t know what to say
But today – I got a feeling like not before
And I guess I can’t – I guess I can’t – I guess I can’t explain
