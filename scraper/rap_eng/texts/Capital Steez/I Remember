[Unreleased Capital STEEZ song, most likely called "I Remember"]

[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]
I said, "What's the definition of real?"
I told em', "Listen to chill"
I ain't even gotta mention the skill
Because Steez been ahead since he popped out the Mama's womb
And had it locked, since they put me in my Papa's tomb
I was three years old
So I really don't remember the day, but I remember his face
And every night I still remember to pray
I remember that it's the little mistakes that made me spit it this way
—shit
It's like Taliban, when I'm dropping bombs
Going line for line
Spitting this shit faster than Ramadan
When my pencil sets sail
Any beat they put on is getting smoked like Big L
We up, on the rise, like the Cages
Coily head nigga with the eyes of an Asian
Blazing
Trapped in a mind full of hatred
Pops' was a Rasta and mom was a Pagan
My man had to get up out of this place
Now he landed in PA
Dawg, I'm happy you safe but
'Round here niggas die everyday
I wouldn't lie to yo face, come back and lie to the, J Man
Said I got that whole town on hold down
When we get on, I blow down a whole pound
I know you see me shutting shows down
And we picking up hoes now..
It's going down, heh

[Outro:]
"Let em' know where you be pimping,"
"It's Capital STEEZ, man, AK x 47, say no more..."
"That's what it is, JonJohnTV, in the building."
"I guess so, I mean, shouts out to the homie Jon John
We just did a show opening up for Mac Miller.. It's crazy
My biggest performance —yet. It's World Domination."
