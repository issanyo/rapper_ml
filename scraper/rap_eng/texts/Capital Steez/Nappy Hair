[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]

The Force will be with you
Always

Yo Kirk you ugly as fuck!
Said, I always looked up to them skate board niggas
With my red lunch box and my beast war stickers
Hard headed nigga, but my hair was even thicker
So I chose to grow it out like 3 or 4 inches
Bitches, diligent
Could've swore you knew it all didn't ya?
10 steps ahead, swifter then John Dillinger
They always thought that I would grow to be a criminal
But either way I'm killin 'em, your boy is so sinister
We got the web flooded like a swimming pool
And little did they know, it's an interlude
So come roll with some stars for the weekend
You could get the red carpet treatment
But if you're on your period you tweaking
Get it?

[Verse 2: Cj Fly]
I don't bargain
I just barge in with no problem and
To be honest I'm a sergeant but she saw a gent
Wear clothes that's your warning
No swastika but my squad sticker
Not a drug dealer
But I'm a road rage kind of bird flipper
Got drive I admit sometimes
It's going down when I'm deep like potholes
Rollin with me you could kick it if you got toe
I mean baby we can kick it if you got sole
Now, don't try to play dumb
Zombie mode kill a nigga with the ray gun
El rey's son, incase the ink dry, I prince
Embalming fluid it Fly's, shit get bodied soon as I spit
You claiming her as your chick
She wanna hang like my bottom lip
Full moon, I get blown
Like a house that's built of straw
Got a gift and I'm a beast, imagine Santa with the claws
Cut out the ups and downs because I've seen too many saws
And dog, I'm on fire like molotovs
Buy a bar with these bars
Certain things just don't fit, probably cause I'm a large
By tryna follow my dreams, I forgot to follow these laws
And Lord...
