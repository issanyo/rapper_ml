[Intro]
The circus is a jungle, why would I stop blazin O's?
Steezy Baby!

[Verse 1]
Said, let me introduce you to the elements
Do it with eloquence, I'm back and I'm better than I ever been
And I ain't goin' nowhere, shit I've been flowing for years
Look, he's here and he's growin' a beard now
How's that for your mainstream?
It's me against time, to try to work against this man's dream
Cause I get more spins than clock radios
Radio the cops and tell them to stop hating though
I'm not taking "no" for an answer anymore
The circus is a jungle, why would I stop blazin O's?
You actin' like I'm out here rapin' hoes
I'm not a criminal, so what the fuck you take me for?
Cause I'm a lower class citizen
Tough pill to swallow like broken glass and cinnamon
Indiscriminate so my vision is red and green like Christmases
Bring them toe tags in again

Yo-yo, y-yo, yo
It's Hip Hop Bitch!

[Verse 2]
Said, let me introduce you to the elements
Ay, you- I heard you shining, but I got that gold membership
I rose from the bush like Valentine's petals
From an unstable family of alkali metals
Hittin' prime time like channel 5 specials
And I never handled rock like Palestine rebels with pebbles
The antics and antiquities with Mr. STEEZ
Always got a trick up my sleeve, bitch, please!
Ain't shit magic or witch craft
Switch class and I barely just passed
A young grasshopper that's trying to skip pads
She trying to get bent like light when it hits glass
Bong smoke got me blazed as hell
Burnin' weight like the 47 J's I scale
You can tell by the amazing smell
And my eyes stay tight like I'm Asian, well
