[Verse 1]
Check this
Who you wanna try and flex with
My senses say you stressin' cause we haven't digressed yet
Climbin' the ladder while supplyin' rhyme patterns
That perhaps been scattered in my mind since back then
The Backwoods, had to make a classic so match this
It's like magic, mix the spinach with the cabbage
In fact I caught the few cap from the shroom patch
Guess whose back with new raps smothered in boom bap
Assume cap, flipped it back like eyelids
To show em how I live, now she blowing down twigs
They both thin and they look like twins
I'm usin' my aura power to overpower the feds
Shit, and act like I never know enough
Thought it was a joke until the numbers started showing up
Roll it up in steam with the Steelo lean
All green you would think it was casino themed man
And it's a different rhythm everytime
Had to switch the signs just to let designers synthesize
Adjust the frequency divine how we synthesize
13 steps, let the enterprise synchronize
And welcome back to the block cuz, smoking 47 blunts a day like true rastas
The blunt doctor, so if you got a minor cough mary jane can fix your lungs up proper
