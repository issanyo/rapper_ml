[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]
I said it's hard to fall off, when you're coming in first
And your mind is at one with the earth
Chubby nigga so I told 'em that my tummy was hurtin'
And then they found out I had a chopper under my shirt [uhh]
I'm not a star, somebody lied
But if you make another move, I'll turn this bitch into Columbine
Shit, I'm going off, bomb threat
And the rest get cut short, like a prom dress
A.D.D. got me feelin' so accomplished, you novice
I could make you one of my accomplices
Ride shotty through Gotham like Robin did
Just don't touch the gauntlets, kid
Cult classic, fuck a four five
Not I, I'd rather be up on cloud nine
The new ninth wonder, Superfly Snuka of this rap shit
I'm flyer than a suicide jumper
And I went and boosted my confidence, from hard rock to hard knock, left the block in astonishment
Any pro tune, I'mma just have to just body it
That's for kamikazes in Nagasaki in opposite
Can't send a boy to do a man's job, 'cause a Tonka Truck's a Tonka Truck, doesn't matter the body kit
And any way that you cut it, I'm still monstrous, hey dude, he's in grade school, so play cool

[Verse 2]
Made fools of Einsteins and wise guys
Since high school, my IQ's been sky high
Living savant when I'm spittin' these bars
Spittin' as hard as I spit it you would injure your jaw
Dog, just to say the least of it, you tryna take over, I ethered it with my weaker shit
Man, I swear since day one they couldn't kick it with the styles that I kick it, since I always been a sneaker pimp
I copped my first Jedi's and De La's at half price, sold them for double, and now I stay fly
Stylin' on 'em since I was standing about 'Ye high, STEEZ been soaring, all you cats do is hang glide
Any questions, answered, AI
Your shit is irrelevant, ever since I started out the smartest kids weren't gettin' it
Questionin' how to get up on this level of excellence
I just tell 'em its natural and they started respectin' it
But, since then, I've been giving them trouble
You couldn't find my logic even if you was Hubble
I mean, J-Steez been sick with this diction
I learned half these words in 5th grade detention
A problem child in the smartest class
Got 'em mad since they heard a prophet in my sonogram
If you ain't heard about it, you should probably ask
Its toetags and bodybags
And then we throw the scraps in the doggybags
