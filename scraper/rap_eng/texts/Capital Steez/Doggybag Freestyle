[Verse 1:]

I said it's hard to fall off, when you're coming in first
And everyone else put in a hearse
Chubby nigga so I told 'em that my tummy was hurtin'
And then they found out I had my rhyme book under my shirt
I'm not going far?, somebody lied
But if you try to touch my crown I'm turning niggas color blind
Shit, I'm raping beats like Bill Cosby under them sheets
Never took an L don't know how it feel to be Meek
A.D.D. got me feelin' so accomplished, you're novice
I could make you one of my accomplices
Ride shotty through Gotham like Robin did
Just don't get crazy kid
Cult classic, fuck a four five
Not I, I'd rather write down four rhymes
The new kid with a nice jumper, I'm like the super fly runners
I'm flyer than a suicide jumper
And I went and boosted my confidence, from hard rock to hard knock, left the block in astonishment
Any fucking tune, I'mma just have to just body it
That's for kamikazes in Nagasaki and all you shits
Can't send a boy to do a man's job, 'cuz a
Fisher price never fishing right, doesn't matter the body kit
And any way that you cut it, I'm still monstrous, hey dude, they all fools so play cool

[Verse 2]

Made fools of Einsteins and wise guys
Since high school, my IQ's been sky high
This isn't even my hardest shit
I've been up to par with all the niggas you partnered with
Dog, just to say the least of it, you tryna take over, I ethered it with my weaker shit
Man, I swear since day one they couldn't kick it with the styles that I kick it, since I always been a sneaker pimp
I copped my first Kilroys and big boys at half price, sold them for double, and now I stay fly
Stylin' on 'em since I was standing about 'Ye high, Sinatra been roaring all you cats just meow high
Any questions, fuck you, not I
Your shit is irrelevant, ever since I started
Out the smartest kids weren't gettin' it
Questionin' how to get up on this level of excellence
I just tell 'em its natural and they started respectin' it
But, since then, I've been giving them trouble
They all want my logic so they gathered in huddles
I mean, B Steve J been sick with this diction
I learned half these words in 6th grade detention
A problem child in the smartest class
Got 'em mad since they saw some profit in my sonogram
If you ain't heard about it, you should probably ask
Its toetags and bodybags
And then we throw the scraps in the doggybags
