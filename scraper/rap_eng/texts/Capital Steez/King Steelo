[Verse 1]
It don't make no sense
Tell me how you make up a set and not make a percent
I bet a lot of people think I'm upset
But I ain't playing defense, I'm more playing the cut and duck taping ya vents
We cutting off ya breathing supply
They say I gotta greedy mind with the green in my eyes
It's the fire that keeps a lot of people inspired
I can't lie, it's America I need to survive, The Wizard of Oz
Tryna live my life behind the plasma
Electromagnetic space started clashing
Road to go, got me caught up with the static
And we blowing out smoke like ectoplasm
I told her make the neck romantic
Move like the Phantom when we shift through Manhattan
My slimes caught an airplane now we radioactive
We coming for New York like the Jets did to Madden

[Hook]
I gotta do it for my team
My third eye beam say it's not what it seems
Niggas tryna get too close ya mean, but I'm clean
That's why they can't touch my steez
So tell me what you know about Steelo
So tell me what you know about Steelo
So tell me what you know about Steelo
So tell me what you know about Steelo

[Verse 2]
Started off kind of scary though, yo Pro peep the scenario
We had the caps fire, and the shrooms like Mario
This peach sumchin was tryna shake her tail
You could tell that I wasn't really funking with the smell
She had a appeal but the pill had her slipping
Fly nigga with a wingspan, cyaan pay attention
My niggas bong ripping so, of course, we all tripping
Four hits, I started dozing off for a minute
And then I went back to the vision
Of when I seen how they had blacks in division
Can't crack through the system, that's why they got crack through ya system
And now we got the matrix hacked with precision
And that's a new flow for all you putos
Tryna compare fools gold to Acapulco's
Beast Coast synchro'd then they see growth
Say they can't post but they gone move slow

[Hook]
I gotta do it for my team
My third eye beam say it's not what it seems
Niggas tryna get too close ya mean, but I'm clean
That's why they can't touch my steez
So tell me what you know about Steelo
So tell me what you know about Steelo
So tell me what you know about Steelo
So tell me what you know about Steelo

[Verse 3]
The root chakra rasta Mufasa
Load the 47 and watch him shoot blocka!
This nigga Sanchez ordered two lobsters
The chicken salad comes with a soup or a pasta
Dig in we pig out, back to the pig pen
We got the green so light it up like Big Ben
In my opinion, she tryna get poked like a pen
And she know I got the stroke like pinyin
That's my ancient technique
You got a king, use them sacred bed sheets
A dirty ragamuffin I ain't changing til next week
We astral projected and I gave her the best sleep
Now that's my part-time freak
The way she shapeshift I should call her my Sheik
Fuck them other bitches I don't keep them on a leash
Unless we taking long walks on the beach

[Hook]
I gotta do it for my team
My third eye beam say it's not what it seems
Niggas tryna get too close ya mean, but I'm clean
That's why they can't touch my steez
So tell me what you know about Steelo
So tell me what you know about Steelo
So tell me what you know about Steelo
So tell me what you know about Steelo
