The lyrics will be completed upon the release of "King Capital". Stay tuned

[Rokamouth]
??? with money
Stay supplying all these J's, no longer just you and me
Three way with Mary Jane, then I take it down slow
You know she ease the pain
Smoke in your veins

[Hook: Capital STEEZ]
47 be them niggas you should ask around
I just got to say the word and it's panties down
Skirts up, panties down, panties down
I just got to say the word and it's panties down
47 be them niggas you should ask around
I just got to say the word and it's panties down
Skirts up, panties down, panties down
I just got to say the word then it's panties down

[Jakk the Rhymer]
I broke you down quite clever, I'm tryna get together
She said she heard it all before, but I had said it better
Can feel the chemistry with every seventh letter
??? it was late, lets set a different day
She on my head like a bounty, I can't shake it
Last night, turned the studio to a spaceship
Cooking my brain like I'm skipping ??? spitting game and
Every time I kick with the dame, it's a different strain
??? psychic advancement, psycho fancy
I like ???, so any chances

[Capital STEEZ]
All it took was some bubbly wine and a couple of dimes to corrupt my mind
Luckily I'm synchronized so I knew ??? would be coming with time
Who's coming inside? You plan on ???
Pass me the jay, if you can't even wait, we can astral project to a comfortable spot
You love when it's hot, ???
I'm sweating like ???, her body odor is my cologne
Never pursue her, like these ??? water is mighty cold
It's 747, that fly shit, no ???
???, you shinning like a crystal
I know you got potential
And girl ???
So can I put seeds in the middle, middle?
Capital STEEZ in the meadow
Can I put seeds in the middle, middle?
Capital STEEZ in the meadow

[Hook]
Cause 47 be them niggas you should ask around
I just got to say the word and it's panties down
Skirts up, panties down, panties down
Said I just got to say the word and it's panties down
