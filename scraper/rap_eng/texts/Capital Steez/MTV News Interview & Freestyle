I can relate to Chuck about like, you know, being at the bottom of the totem pole
Like you know, you put yourself in a mindset
It's like you know, you lower your expectations, it's like you know?
Something big is always going to happen, you know?
And that's kinda the mindset I gotta keep reminding myself everyday
And that's how I kinda like stay afloat in this 47 shift, you know?
It's a cold-world out here, but...

[Verse 1]
Just another teen
The beard kinda scruffy, so I refuse to cut it clean
It's dark chocolate, but it's colored green
Forty-ounces, red lipstick, and yellow submarines
We red-linin' like tape-ups
Them lady cops been flashing headlights like 8-cups
And Kirk said them hipster girls going wild
So I'm proud to say, we said that shirts outta style
70k and my inbox filled up
Firewalls, I got my empire wall built up
I know Rome wasn't built in a day, I live where I lay
Roman rolling stone, it begins with a 'a'
Nomadic, no amends, the flow addict
We buzzin' in yo ear like headphone static
Attack of the clones, like drones crash-landed
So I know we ain't alone on this planet
