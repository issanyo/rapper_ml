[Intro: Chuck Strangers]
I'm drinking a 40
Pat's eating noodles
Jesse rolled a blunt
I'm coming on the beat
Let these niggas know what's up

[Verse 1: Chuck Strangers]
Who be I, Chuck yes
Smoke sesh', you can't handle
Doing what I plan to
This is the crew, man I thought you knew
The papers Raw, and the beats is too
And the freaks is too
Then the homies coming through
RSVP jam offers too
I walked up in your shit, and all these hoes ugly
But I'm still up for something
'Cause Kirk Knight brought me my grandpa swag
Vintage polo tags
Catch me stuntin' like your dad
That's the fool, you wished you had the fat boy's back
You can tell your homegirls that
The sky is the limit
We don't sell weed that got no seeds in it
Looking in the mirror and impressed with the new me
You been on my mind, but the money is all I see
Look ma', No hands
Niggas rollin', my watch showin’
You mad? It’s too bad
You stressed off them seeds in yo quarter bag?
My [?] roll something that you wish y’all had

[Hook: Chuck Strangers]
I don't want no 9-5
I don't want no 9-5
I don't want no 9-5
I don't want no 9-5
I don't want no 9-5
I don't want no 9-5
Better keep an open mind if you're trynna survive
I don't want no 9-5

[Verse 2: Uno Hype]
I felt that I deserved it all
Figured I stand tall when the curtains calls
What if it ain't work at all?
Then it ain't worth it dawg
See the way I work these bars
With the vision that could birth a star
Flow's mean cause I'm working hard
Been a vet, why you swerving off?
One take then I'm floatin' off
Nugs from a purple jar, lock jaw when I pull it
You get locked off and I couldn't
Cats salty how I push shit
We pepper ass niggas
The 90s made some reckless ass niggas
Low cash niggas, flow gas niggas
Peyton Mannin how I'm passing it
Hope the dro' pass quicker, than the masses grip ya
Fuck the hype, how I switch up
Kush-ups in the morning like nigga fuck som sit-ups
Get the picture that I print up
Most MC's need guidance so they pick us, so twist up
I put my guidance in the swisher
Too much money to be floatin' 'round so nigga get up

[Hook: Uno Hype]
Fuck a 9-5
Fuck a 9-5
Keep an open mind if you're trying to survive
But nigga fuck a 9-5
Fuck a 9-5
Nigga, fuck a 9-5
Rather get rich off this rap shit than steal or rob
Nigga, fuck a 9-5

[Verse 3: Capital STEEZ]
I'm coming from the home place of way too many mouths to be fed
When you make it to be the greatest or you're probably dead
And 9 to 5 is the only time you can spend
This is coming from the bottom of my heart and off the top of my head
Just freestyling in them hallways all day
Thought that you was balling that's until you seen Lebron play
Like you better step your shit up kid
We in the school of hard knocks with the stick up kids
A little fame will make your best man switch quick
An unspoken truth so you betta keep your lip zipped
An infant to the game bout to hit six
Years writing verses and I still ain't get rich
I guess I'm looking for a man to blame, getting older realizing it'll have to change
So by the age of 21 I'ma have a champagne range rover, J roller, and a platinum chain

[Hook: Capital STEEZ]
Cuause I don't want no 9 to 5
I don't want no 9 to 5
You better keep an open mind if your trying to survive
Cause I don't want no 9 to 5
Said I don't want no 9 to 5
I don't want no 9 to 5
Better keep an open mind if your trying to survive
Cause I don't want no 9 to 5
