[Capital STEEZ]
See don't mind if I do

I be your locksmith, you be my accomplice, mission impossible accomplished (x2)

[Hook: Junior Bell]
They say love is blinded sometimes you never know
But it's a thing you find and you'll never want to let go
You gotta free your mind, you gotta see the signs
Open up your eyes, Open up your eyes

[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]
So, I'll admit that I don't know what love is
I still tend to use the word "like" in the wrong sense
The best thing I had, I was in a rush to throw away
A way it ended on a note with nothing more to say
Let alone drop the Prada try to make it far
Old mistakes we want it all but on a larger plate
I learn to late and can't have her
I brought the silver platter but its like it never mattered
Now we can do the unthinkable my minds post-grad
But my heart's back in middle school
People say moving on is always the hardest thing to do
Cause even than I'mma think of you
My one and only your the first of many
The best I ever had or the worst of plenty
But if I had a second chance I would be a better man
Just to insure that you won't forget me
I never knew a love like this
So no way I'd ever give up that quick
And each day, I learn a bit about myself
So disregard all this confidence
See we all do it
We're all human
And I don't know it all so we can walk through it
And I know sometimes I talk foolish
If you have slightest doubt in me, than I'll prove it
I lost love so what's left to lose
What's next to prove
Is when I'm next to you
That I'm a better man
And I'm far from perfect
I'm just hoping you'd accept it too
And if not I can't blame you for that
I gave you more than enough reasons
For not taking me back
But on the same note
Here's a reason to try again
I understand you don't have to invite me in
When you try I shut it down quick and early
We both know how I handle things immaturely
One thing that I learn about love
Is no matter what they say, picture perfect is never certain
Women learn faster than men do
But this is something I would gladly rekindle
See, you probably thought this was easy to right
But the first two went through have of my pencil
Love isn't a crime and it can build the most simple of mind
If it's given with time
And this is all I can give you of mine
A piece of my heart, and if you didn't want to listen its fine
It's all I can give you of mine
A piece of my heart, and if you didn't want to listen its fine
So I'mma just sit and rewind reminiscing cause your just another victim of time
