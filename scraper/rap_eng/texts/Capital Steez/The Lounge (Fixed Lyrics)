(Intro)
I'm drinking a forty
Pat's eating noodles
Jesse rolled a blunt
Eye couple on the beat
Let these niggas know what's up

(Chuck Strangers)
Who we are, Chuck yes
Smoke sesh, you can't handle
Doing what I plan to
This is the crew and I thought you knew
(?) and the freaks stay too
Then the homies coming through
RSVP (?)
I walked up in your shit
I'm still up for something
Because Kirk Knight brought me my grandpa swag
Vintage polo tags
Catch me strutting like your dad
That's the fool, you wished you had the fat boys back
You can tell where your homegirls at
The sky is the limit
We don't sell weed that got no seeds in it
Looking in the mirror and impressed with the new me
You been on my mind, but the money is all I see
Look ma'
No hands
Niggas rolling
My watch showing
You mad?
Too bad

(Hook)
I don't want no 9-5
I don't want no 9-5
I don't want no 9-5
I don't want no 9-5
I don't want no 9-5
I don't want no 9-5
You have to keep an open mind if you're trying to survive
I don't want no 9-5

[Uno Hype]
I felt that I deserved it all
Figured I stand tall when the curtains calls
What if it ain't work at all?
Then it ain't worth it dawg
See the way I work these bars
With the vision that could birth a star
Flow's mean cause im working hard
Been a vet, why you swerving off?
One take then im floatin off
Nugs from a purple jar, lock jaw when I pull it


You get knocked off when I couldn't
You cats salty how I push it
We pimpin ass niggas, the 90's made some breakfast ass niggas
Low cash nigga,flow gas niggas
Peyton Mannin how im passin it
Hope the dro pass quicker then the masses grip ya
Fuck the hype how I switch up
Push-ups in the morning like nigga fuck some sit-ups
Get the picture that I print up
Most MC's need got it til they pick up so twista I put my guidance in the swisha
Too much money to be floatin round so nigga get up

(Hook)
Fuck a 9-5
Fuck a 9-5
Keep a open mind if you're trying to survive
But fuck a 9-5
Fuck a 9-5
Nigga, fuck a 9-5
This rap shit's still alright
Nigga, fuck a 9-5

(Capital STEEZ)
I'm coming from the home place of way too many mouths to be fed
When you make it to be the greatest or you're probably dead
And 9 to 5 is the only time you can spend
This is coming from the bottom of my heart and off the top of my head
Just freestyling in them hallways all day
Thought that you was balling that's until you seen Lebron play
Like you betta stick your shit up kid
We in the school of hard knocks with the stick up kids
A little fame will make your best man switch quick
An unspoken truth so you betta keep your lip zipped
An infant to the game bout to hit 6 years writing verses and I still ain't get rich
I guess I'm looking for a man to blame, getting older realizing it'll have to change
So by the age of 21 I'ma have a champagne range rover, J roller, and a platinum chain


(Hook)
Cuz i dont want no 9 to 5
I dont want no 9 to 5
You betta keep an open mind if your trying to survive
Cuz i dont want no 9 to 5
I said i dont want no 9 to 5
I dont want no 9 to 5
You betta keep an open mind if your trying to survive
Cuz i dont want no 9 to 5
