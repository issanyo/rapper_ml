[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]
She's like a miracle and an accident, exactly what I asked for
The calm before the storm and the rainbow coming after it
The reason for my happiness, definition of passionate
Say it's true love when it's laughter that you laughin' at
Crazy style and you know just how to make me smile
That ain't the end of it, in fact this might take a while
So I'mma take my time and tell you how I feel
So take a hit and we can get lifted while I break this down
I was hoping I could walk with you and talk with you
But that's only if you want me to
Fortunately I've grown to be a part of you
So all I'm asking for is a little bit of fortitude
Ain't that a bitch if all dogs go to heaven
Us good guys come like one in every seven
I made my mistakes and every second I regret it
And hope for a second chance at this first impression
Princess, if you ain't impressed yet, you can be my empress
We can royal flush on some king shit
The bow tie the same color as your lipstick
So joy ride with me, stick shift
And one thing lead to another
We can wear the handcuffs, but keep it undercover
I cuff her, you be my baby motha if you wanna
Cause lovers don't have to wear rubbers, disgusting

[Hook: T'nah Apex (Capital STEEZ)]
Do you really have it like that? (Like dat)
Show me that you got it like that (Like dat)
Do you really have it like that? (Like dat)
Kiss that, and that, give it like that (Like dat)
Do you really have it like that? (Like dat)
Show me that you got it like that (Like dat)
Do you really have it like that? (Like dat)
Kiss that, and that, give it like that (Like dat)

[Verse 2: A La $sole]
Biting your lips as we visit those positions
Experience of this feeling it was so serious
Baby was driven into winning so her panties disappeared from this magician
And then I hit it with no intention
But this tension got me pretending this love don't imprison
Her prism asserted my decision
She was so with it, I was so witty
She scratching on my back while I'm swanking on her titties
Turn off the TV and made our own movie scene
Turn off the phone so no hoes would intervene
As in between your jeans, your thighs, your seams
It seems she wanted more of me
Damn right, a nigga like me gave it to her
She through it back and I relaxed as I gave it to her
Cause I ain't never been a quick pumper
This is real love, no fake baby, never no Brian Pumper
But as I love you, I know you hear the thunder
Make you rain, bed so wet, using my umbrella
Called in sick then said that you was under the weather
But you was getting wetter as the ride was getting better and better
Kissing so clever, you know what's next up
Lay on your back or whatever
Pain is pleasure as I caress ya
Banging on your dresser
Turn off the lights and let A La undress ya
