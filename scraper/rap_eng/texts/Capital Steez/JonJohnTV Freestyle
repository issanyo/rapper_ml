[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]
I said what's the definition of ill? I told them listen and chill
I ain't even gotta mention the skill
Because STEEZ been ahead since he popped out the momma's womb
And had it locked since they put me in my papa's tomb
I was 3 years old, so I really don't remember the day but I remember his face
And every night I still remember to pray
And remember it's the little mistakes that made me spit it this way
It's like taliban when I'm dropping bombs, going line for line
Spitting this shit fasting, it's ramadan
When my pen-cil sets sail, Any beat they put on is getting smoked like Big L
We up on a rise like the cajuns, cooly haired nigga with the eyes of a asian
Blazin, trapped in a mind full of hatred
Pops was a rasta and mom was a pagan
My man had to get up out of this place now he living in PA, dawg wherever you safe
But, around here niggas die everyday, I wouldn't lie to your face
Come back and light up a J, man!
Shit, I got the whole town to hold down
When we get on I'm blowing down a whole pound
I know you see me shutting shows down
And we pickin up hoes now
It's going down

[Jon John]
Uh, let them know who you be, pimpin

[Capital STEEZ]
It's Capital STEEZ, man AK47, say no more
Shouts out to the homie Jon John
We just did this show opening up for Mac Miller
It's crazy, my biggest performance yet
It's world domination
