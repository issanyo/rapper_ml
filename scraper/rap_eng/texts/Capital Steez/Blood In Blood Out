[Verse 1: Lost]
The chosen one is not chosen
The non-righteous path
To leave a trail of blood and tears
Like a Sierra Leone death squad
God's bidding his deaths mission and in turn
[?] my day-jobs but won’t quit what I’m good at
So what if I'm a misfit like baggy pants
That just means there's more room for your girl to squeeze in
But that's besides the point
Because my lyrics are on point
Like ballerinas feet
Talk with it personification of an inner animal trying to break my rib cage
Tear apart my spleen and cut off my oxygen
But I won't be silenced
I'm the child of an unstoppable force
And an immovable object
On a crash course with a morgue
Filled with those that failed to touch the ground
I relate to those bizarre
But won't take it lying down
Who respect the hustle
And get trampled
And left in the dust
Of the lost soul torn from your worst nightmare
And go against the current
The tides are changing
So either swim or left to drown
And be enveloped in the sounds of hell hounds
Searching for those who missed the call of salvation, total annihilation
Of the egotistical, non forgivable
No elliptical can change the shape of this outcome
There's no escaping it
Final Destination that'll rock the nation
Call it D.O.A
Death of animation
Cause this shit's real as it gets
Mark the day you hear this track
See where you are and where I'm at
Compare the vocabs and subtract the difference
And make six figures while riding with LOST productions, bitch

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
It's Mr. J-A-Y
Look
I pledge allegiance to class rooms with missing teachers
Go ahead and cut some more jobs I don't think we need it
Spending money on sex scandals and strip teases
And these the selfish motherfuckers that we pick to lead us?
It's splurging on the murders and burglars
But I don't really think our foolish youth
Deserve to learn enough
Make sense why he grew up so dumb don't it
The main reason why I'm keeping all these blunts rolling
Heard the beat and I just knew I had to jump on it
These the wise ambitions of a young stoner
Hold up,I prefer the term herbalist
Superb young verbalist
Inspired off the purp I piff
It don't matter cause either way
I'm rolling two Ls and a J
Feelin cool till I burn my lip
I'm bumping at American terrorists
Finger to America homie
I ain't scared of shit
Unless I'm looking at the man in the mirror
And he know me way better than a specialist or therapist
Shit, how you telling me I'm not gifted
When niggas stealing my styles
They shoplifting
Yeah I got some issues maybe you should stop and listen
The biggest threat and I ain't even have to pop a pistol
Fuck redemption I'm back with a vengeance
And venomous fit like slim fits bitch
It's the two blade crusade
I got my ski mask on waiting for doomsday
And I don't give a fuck on what you say
Or she say that he said she said cliche
