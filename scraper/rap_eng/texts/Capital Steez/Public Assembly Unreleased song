[Intro]
I didn't even record this shit yet,  like on some real shit. Don't tell me  "I don't feel it" because I dont care because its real, you know. Like I had no other choice but to feel it

[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]
I've been emancipated from mental slavery, That's word to my rastas
Cell blocked mind so I got my head locked up
My third eye chakra was blocked and the flash from the cops
Made this indigo path that I follow, that's word to my father
Watch when the Babylon pass Got a stash in my basketball pants
Got enough fire to light up a whole camp
I an I never thought to inspire a grown man
PROgression is the basis with eleven different phases
The faces of the Moon cause the Earth to start shaking
They say it's our world for the taking and Imma win it all for my girl and my bacon
Lately I've been thinking since it's dried up like raisins
The system's like bud when we break it
The slim foundation were undeveloped seeds in the middle
That's why they really need an individual
So I guess we're the biggest and we're setting up the villains for the rest of you niggas
Deny? Nigga I'm the best don't forget it
All it took was 13 steps and I did it

[Hook: Capital STEEZ]
And today I got a feeling that I’ve never felt
And I don’t know what I don’t know what I don’t know what to say
But today I got a feeling like non before
And I guess I can’t I guess I can’t I guess I can’t explain

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
I was born to be a step ahead shit, they got the system to assist them
We got the system that turned us into Victims
All my aunts was living with 8 children plus section 8 is still trying to evict them
Said look at the world we’re here living in
I’m too proud to say it ain’t law abiding citizens
It’s cuz I’m black isn't it? Or the characteristics of your last statistic
Bastards said I couldn’t define happiness and my master said I couldn’t pass as a pacifist
I dealt with more pain than a masochist
And I hold back tears like a hankerchief
I said I wanna be a rap star
Mom saw black cards and fast cars
Fuck Ferrari”s, Bacardi and Parties I wanna change the world I'm Awfully sorry
Time for me to be the next Bob Marley, Marcus Garvey or Mohandas Gandhi
And follow MLK tips, JaKK rides shotty while we steer towards greatness
And I still haven’t found my placement
Cuz hip hop hasn't made a leap of faith yet

[Hook: Capital STEEZ]
And today I got a feeling that I’ve never felt
And I don’t know what I don’t know what I don’t know what to say
But today I got a feeling like non before
And I guess I can’t I guess I can’t I guess I can’t explain
