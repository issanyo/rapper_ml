[Intro - Tonedeff]

Do you really know your friends? Ha, I used to think the same thing

[Hook - Leon Russell sample]

I love you in a place, where there's no space and time
(come on)
I love you for my life, cause you're a friend of mine
I love you in a place, where there's no space and time
(when you're up against the wall, will they get you?)
I love you for my life, cause you're a friend of mine

[Verse 1 - Tonedeff]

Have you ever been betrayed? That shit's the worst hit of pain
When somebody you loved can't look you in your face
And have you ever had your heart torn out by somebody you thought was your friend
And now your trust is worn down or bought to an end
No pardons can mend it when you're darkened within
Fuck cause & effect, it's a hard fate to take, and your reasons don't soften the sin
Your dogs can bark for you, but you gotta watch when you argue
Cause dogs will bite and snarl at you, just to remind you that they're harmful
I feel awful, I'm a mental case, shattered to pieces and I've got a palm full
Past law school and beyond consul
Cause you've crossed the bar with me, farther than I've ever thought possible
My choice is now mandatory and not optional
Don't ever speak another sentence to me, ever mention me
I don't exist, convince yourself you invented me
You've committed the crime of the century
And just cause loyalty ain't a trait you possess, Don't think that I'll lessen the penalty

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Tonedeff]
What's your name again, I know I knew it 2 seconds ago
But I don't recognize this second face, though to the first it's identical
You were the type that I put on a pedestal, your acts were commendable
But the bond of friendship isn't impenetrable
And inevitably the blunt force of ego proved lethal
To a good person forced to wallow in the shit of evil people
Fundamentally filled with avarice, a cheat from the soul
Spending their lives to make sure that you ain't achieving your goals
Unreasonable kings that want to see you jump through rings of fire
For their own amusement, holding nooses, hoping trees are higher
So abusive towards you that truce just doesn't seem required
Cause why play the game when you can make the other team retire?
Strings are tirelessly pulled in your favour as you play the rumor creator
Twisting words 'til they sound like statements you made up
With a big grin you soak it all in, as former friends
Go face to face with contradicting convictions
Plots are thickening, cause you pitched in, you feel important now?
Must've been high as a kite from snorting clouds
Sorta proud of yourself, and the way you hold your ground
Distastefully wore the shroud, how's it feel to have puppets to order 'round?
But I saw through you, even before I found
How you would say 'no beef', give me a dap, and hit me with a quarter-pound
Your loyalty's watered down, bottled with a squirt cap
But when the drama popped off, where the fuck are you to plug the cork back

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Tonedeff]
Men are as harsh as women are vindictive
Picking apart minutiae on some bitch shit, kids all in your business
Forget honesty, nowadays you'll be lucky to find that quality
In a drama odyssey where cats never react responsibly
And I'm jostling with haters, hypocrites and hypochondriacs
Abolishing their dated ignorance and fighting copycats
And if I don't give my patience a rest
I'll probably take my anger to death, complaining about some pain in my chest
Aged and distressed, thinking 'bout who just fucked me over 20 years ago
Amazing how pricks can miss your skin, yet pierce your soul
But where's the line at? Like where does loyalty appear to fold
And what do you owe someone and just what do you feel you're owed?
But yo, you know when you've been done wrong, that numb calm
A breach in the moral code's eternally portable
The moral of the story's old, even if it's poorly told
Beware of cats that straddle fences like the chain-link rodeo

[Hook]
