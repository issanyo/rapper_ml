[Verse 1: Tonedeff]
So regal, beautiful
Too bad I’ll never see the funeral
And even through the doom and gloom
As soon as the moon can be viewed in full
I saw a star in the heavens; I knew it was you
My anxiety is through the roof
Can’t deny the irrefutable truth
That I’m alive in lieu of you
And in the silence of your tomb
I hear your cries as you’re consumed
Your spirit ride, illuming under the twenty thousand hues of blue
Fade out
Zoom in
I felt your heart as I grew in your womb
The constant bass is soothe in tune
I drew from you like still-lights
Was still born with room to move
I’d use in pursuit of my roots
I would later be groomed to lose
Last June I tattooed this date in numerals under my chin
The last place ever touched by your skin
‘Cause something within me loves to pretend that you’re my mother again
Though I barely remember you tucking me in
There’s a constant nagging
My subconscious acting up
Thoughts that’s drawn from the past
Constant racking of pots and pans
Up in the kitchen cooking
Mom and dad arguing again
Saw your chance, so I guess you took it
You had the heart to match the strongest hands that God could grant a woman
Carried the term, but never saw the man your son is
And sometimes I can’t confront it
I’m asking what I’d give to be you
But as dawn advances I bid you adieu
My..

I know you can still hear
You’d be proud, huh?
I’ve done a lot
I met this beautiful, beautiful woman
She reminds me of you

[Verse 2: Tonedeff]
So radiant, vibrant
Hazel tint in her eyes and the way that her skin shines is
Like a phoenix rising, even I could be surprised if we entwine
I feel the climate reach its highest peeks when she’s besides me
But we got deeper ties than physical needs, desires
Typically we aspire to dream and climb the steepest heights that we can find
And better, redefine the cheapened lives we seek and find
And there’s a reason to bind together
Though sometimes I tell some teeny lies to feed her pride and sleep between her thighs
My peace of mind is reached if I can keep a smile on
If the seas are wild then she’s an island
Complete with whitened beach to greet the tide in
Or retreat to hiding where you can flea to dryness
A peaceful night beneath the sky so we can speak in private
On the water for an easy ride
Nobody’s speaking either
She reminds me of you in some ways
It’s like they redesigned her
Flinging rocks off the eastern side to watch ‘em sink in silence
I take a knee for Her Highness
Her mere presence a gift to me
I kiss a ring of diamonds
Take pride in the queen my bride is
Her Amphitrite to my King Poseidon
And she’s decided in her sneaky slyness she’d conceive a titan
I’m uneasy, I can feel the heightened fear inside
As tears arrive, her fingers guide me to this breathing child that’s lying beneath her nighty
She don’t have the slightest idea what tonight is
I hear the singing sirens
I bid her adieu as she and I collide as my..
