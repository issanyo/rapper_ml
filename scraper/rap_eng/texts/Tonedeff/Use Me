[Intro: Tonedeff]
Use me, Use me
Drag me along, and use me up
Use me, Use me
Drag me along, and use me up

[Verse 1: Tonedeff]
I’m your puppet, no strings attached
Complete any task you could dream to ask
I could pretend that I need you back
So that at opposite ends, we’re an even match/
Damn, I didn’t mean to snap
I will cooperate, tell me your three commands/
The way I coddle you, quell all your greed, demands/
You’d think I’d conjured a spell from a genie’s lamp
Hey somebody gotta be the master/
On a team there’s captains,on the seas - commanders
Honestly I’m glad with how you lead the path
So, I’m willing to sacrifice all it seems you’re after/
I’m kinda fond of the leaching act with all the schemes & plans
My self-esteem is damaged
And a hunter never questions an easy catch -
It didn’t take a documentary to teach me that/
Now, I’m seeing the pattern, it’s easy to add up
I’m never the one to leave when it’s bad or to keep it from happening
Inevitably the reason you pass with sneaky tactics
Is some karmic revenge from my seedy past - Uh!
I can’t help it - I’m free but I’m trapped - CHOOSE
A black pelican whose wings have been snapped - MOVE
And you’re selling pics to people to peep me intact
Abuse me. Use me

[Hook: Tonedeff]
Use me, Use me
Drag me along, and use me up
Use me, Use me
Drag me along, and use me up

[Bridge: Tonedeff]
Cause everybody loves you the day you make em a millionaire
Till someone else can make em a billionaire
Till someone else can make em trillionaire
Let's see you take away the things they want
Will they still be there?

[Verse 2: Tonedeff]
So...did you get everything your heart desired?
And is there anything you want revised?
Cause I’ll go editing the fabric of my being
‘Til the thread of me is casually tossed aside
See I’m tailor-made to cater to your whims
For an awesome price, see the cost is pride
If you can live with and admit it’s been a grift/
Stickin' around for the gifts like a mobster’s wife/
Right, I don’t wanna bring your flaws to the light
Cause I’m partly responsible like
If I ever stumbled in the wake of all your lies
I know without a doubt it wouldn't even stop your stride/
I wish I was somebody more like you
With no conscious, drive and a darker side
And still appear half-sane /
But it’s too late to be launching a fucking smear campaign when the marker’s dry
I’m feeling a bit lost inside
Though I thought I was holding my moral compass right side up
But my mind’s kinda stuck
Deciding if I should draw the line at the crossing sign/
So, which way is wrong? Is it right? CHOOSE
Switch daily as long as you like. MOVE
Hit play on this song, you can call me tonight
Abuse me. Use Me

[Outro: Tonedeff]
Use me, Use me
Drag me along, and use me up
Use me, Use
Drag me along, and use me up
