[Verse 1: Substantial]
I’ve seen many things over the years even shared many
Dreams with fam, friends and peers and it seems that
Life is hardly ever fair making clean living
Nearly impossible and rare. When I was younger
And that hunger for more came to the door
Knocks sounding like shots wasn’t sure what it fucked with me for
Now I know it was the push I needed
I wish everybody from my hood received it
I gotta be their light that shines minus the strife and crime
And keep our struggle in mind when I write these rhymes
‘Cause them dudes in my hood didn’t back me for nothing
For me to move to Brooklyn just to catch me there fronting
I’m gonna represent until they bury me in Harmony
Cemetery where I will lay to rest with my pop and niece
Properly! So when I’m gone a good quote
To describe what I represented is hood hope

[Hook: Steph & rnb]
I give hope to
Folks just like you
And yours so watch me
Nothing can stop me
I give hope to
Folks just like you
And yours so watch me
Nothing can stop me

[Verse 2: Substantial]
Pardon the way I come at y'all but my boy once said
That if it wasn’t for the devil wouldn’t have no fun at all
I knew I had to stall so I could see what I was facing
And now this older man can overstand his situation
Forced to work with nothing so I’m naturally creative
And joe I’m not surprised when they’re mad to see I’ve made it
But what do you expect I was forced to adapt
And not every single one of us is caught in the trap
Like me… I chose to keep my hustle unique
Getting money for my art wasn’t nothing to me
In case you’re wondering what’s that have to do with this song
Basically I made a living out of proving them wrong
They said I wouldn’t be shit now they’re hearing me spit
Pops said I couldn’t draw but he wasn’t right at all was he?
Look what I’ve done with the little I’ve worked with
Far from perfect but the struggle was all worth it

[Hook: Steph & RnB]
I give hope to
Folks just like you
And yours so watch me
Nothing can stop me
I give hope to
Folks just like you
And yours so watch me
Nothing can stop me

[Verse 3: Substantial]
We fighting AIDS, liquor stores, crack addicted whores
Absentee fathers, nicotine, bottles
Of Hennessy, self hate and racism
Crack cocaine and all sorts of laced ism
Poverty even crooked ass police
A shady government and did I mention no peace
Illiteracy, war, gentrification
And on top that constant humiliation
Just to name a few but you can’t buckle or crumble
Though it’s hella difficult overcoming our struggles
But I’m living proof that it can be done
And I’m still battling until victory’s won I’m as real
As you and your issues are no different from mine
Except I’ve found a forum where folks can listen to mine
So when I’m spitting these rhymes motivate is what I try to do
‘Til the day I rest I do my best to inspire you

[Hook: Steph & RnB]
I give hope to
Folks just like you
And yours so watch me
Nothing can stop me
I give hope to
Folks just like you
And yours so watch me
Nothing can stop me

[Substantial]
Nothing can stop me
Nothing can stop me
Nothing can stop me
Nothing can stop me

[Outro: Steph]
Nothing can stop me now
Nothing can stop me now
