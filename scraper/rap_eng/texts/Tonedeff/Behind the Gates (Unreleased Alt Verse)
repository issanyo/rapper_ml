Lights out, no reason to fight now
Silence abound, no question my life was in doubt
But I found a profound sense of peace as I rise from the crowd
That are crying out loud over the flesh that still lies on the ground
I’m reminded of how I’ve kinda been righteous
I’m proud that I was just like this
Renowned, the shrine of politeness
The town’s retired fireman, honoured vet with a likeness
So why’d the power’s abound with a mind refined as a wine
Family ties never bonded me, had a child who was nine when she
Chose her Mom as a parent, our marriage failing divisively
Visitation and sharing wasn’t apparent till privacy
Hit a snag because heroin made her mama a pariah, see
When she perished and took my daughter’s inheritance silently
Least moved to her to an environment she’s be livin’ in quietly
Sacrificed my whole life to raise her as pious as I could be
So that she’d enter heaven without bias from the highest seat
Up in the sky, she never grew to see eye to eye with me
Blinded by adolescence, her passions acted defiantly
Wait! Is my mind in a haze?
Look! I’ve arrived at these gates
I see a figure standing guard who invites me to pray
