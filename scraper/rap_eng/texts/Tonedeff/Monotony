[Verse 1]
I am a product of artistic inspiration
My words are spoken only in an attempt to form a lyrical condemnation
Of today’s intoxication with sedation
The threat of wax evasion, since the day they killed the crowd participation
It’s been only precipitation chasin' rain clouds on the never endin'
To prevent the lendin' of the negative auras that they’re sendin'
Over those instrumentals, No incidentals gone about it…
That element will keep your mind shrouded with the doubted
I’ve ranted and I’ve raved and I’ve shouted
Wondering how’d it get so irreversibly rerouted
Indelibly crowded. Incredibly clouded with the wackest that the wack have had to offer
In fact, I take my hat off to Chaucer
But, kids be poetically pathetic
Claiming they’ve aided and abetted, now hip-hop is diabetic
Who’s got the anesthetic?
Tonedeff be on it to get it monotone and synthetic, nobody said it better
Keepin' the sugar embedded, niggas are now indebted
To the rhythm in the notion that hookers get wet and spread it
Off is the way I set to the tune of how I bring it to your juncture
(305) is coming through to puncture
The status quo, I be the baddest bro to tap it slow
I’m lost as far as mathematics go, but lyrics are the major
‘Cause it’s within my nature to debate and deviate ya’
That’s unless you are your own, so, I’m a keep it monotone

[Hook]
Exist to be free
Revise the Hip-Hop mentality, you must be stoppin’ the monotony
It’s how it oughtta be, but all these wannabe’s that MC
Continue droppin’ the monotony
Commit to who ya’ be. To live for MC artistry
Tonedeff be stoppin’ the monotony
It’s verbal sodomy, when all these wannabe’s that MC
Continue droppin’ the monotony

[Verse 2]
I be the M-O-N-O, the T-O-N-E
The D-E to the double the F, I’m fresh when I free alphabetically
I did it Steadily, yo, with my nigga Gilligan
And then I slammed with Mister Logic, RBM be iller than
A schizophrenic in the brain. We strained so hard to gain fame
Throughout our years of adolescence- To this day we learned our lessons
But above it all, we learned that in the (305)
True lyricists never say die… So keep it on

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This year I keep it monotonic
One Vibe, One Love, One Drum- from analog to monophonic
‘Cause when I get on it, my monologue be monolithic
Niggas claim that they’re gifted but they’re only monotypic
Hip hop’s monopolistic. A&R’s are sadistic
‘Cause they’ve twisted heads to points where the market’s cannibalistic
But, yo, I’ve come equipped with the shit that be automatic
How can you be artistic when you be monochromatic?
RBM be my hermanos, the name be monogrammatic
When I become emphatic my words are monosyllabic
Yo, we go mono a mono in the tragic state of static
I’m mad ‘cause I’ve had it with all of the gats and ganja addicts
My life’s melodramatic
MC’s figure they’re hard And think that they’re monometallic, their minds are so simplistic
They’re just a bunch of misfits claiming they’re monogamistic
Yo, but I know, they’re suckers and they’re bound to catch mono

Chorus
