I am the epitome of mentally fit lyrical wizardry
Fear the ability, making miracles appear to you vividly
With an affinity within me willing to deal every enemy penalties
You're over the line, cause you crossed me like symmetry
You're that pussy, cat that's finicky like Morris
Serving ya' plate, but every inning you're scoreless
Making ya' day like Doris, I'll put you away for good like storage
My formula's more of a sure thing than a whore It's:
Shorten your life-span with a verse and a chorus
I'm certain to floor kids, the minute I rip the curtains before us
Asserting the forces of nature, burning ya' forest
Even hurling sterling performers twirling towards the camera lenses of
Discerning tourists observing the horrors
As they take it all in like porous surfaces
Spurting these murderous lyrical scourges
Cause I'm a purist and you're TRIFE life is purposeless
Just give it up, like slutty mannequins, you're a fake fuck
It seems you lost all your sense like Helen Keller going bankrupt
I'm pitch shifting, making your facial display change up
Detaching your superfluous pieces like pay stubs
You didn't take nuff precaution
Stepping to Tonedeff is like calling out Irish motherfuckers in Boston
I'm hunting you down for goodwill, my game is out there
You couldn't rock in your grandma's house chair
My syntax rearranges your flesh like skin grafts
The odds of you winning are slimmer than Ally McBeal on Slimfast
You're like them other actresses
I'm tighter than 4 virgins in solitary confinement
With hymens as THICK as rubber mattresses
With asses split to make a perfect fit- like a cock in you
I only play your shit to remind me what not to do
I'm executing verses you thought were impossible
From the JUMP, you were merely a hoppable obstacle
Stick ya' like Popsicle's, in lines you stand in back of me
On tracks, you couldn't bust a nut
While a slamming a hammer in the Planters factory
I'm seedier that your papi, you're a flower, son
Your hour's come in a plastic bag, just watch me devour some
Your delusions of power's done, cause each and all believe you need to fall
So, I be torching up ya bleeding walls like Seton Hall
Deleting beats and knocking your skull into a handy coffin
So don't be shocked when you're the man on the moon like Andy Kaufman
You'll be deader than Bambi's mom when the brush went up in smoke
You're shit's cheesier than the state of Wisconsin
Yo, fate is a consonant; cause, "AE!!", I-O-U nothing
You've just been 'disem-voweled' as I've been rocking shit
You know the difference between you and a dog's life?
Yo, Eventually with training a dog'll be nice
