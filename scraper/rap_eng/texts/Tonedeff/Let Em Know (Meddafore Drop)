[Verse 1: Tonedeff]
Yo. Now is this the center of gravity? Or is it the cats that be
Frantically pulling me down grabbing at my saddle to handle me
Leaving em cattle branded with logos stamped on they asses
When taxes are filed, I claim niggas as my property assets
I’ve properly asked for things, acting mannered
But cats haven’t granted me access to the respect or props that I’ve practically gathered
Over the passage of time, I’ve mastered the many facets of rhyme
But ask Sam Jackson, the only life that’s been shafted is mine
I’m past trying to fit in with niggas half as aspiring
Tired, but I won’t ever give in… even after retirement
Heat! You can either dry with or die with blistering flames
So stay tuned because I’m about to stick fists in they face
In a vicious display of wits, only tricks of the trade you know
Are the Chickens you date, that get dickens for pay
You’re a sickening case, think your slick in this game?
Then, your mic gets switched and replaced, as I toss the pin in your face as you grip the grenade
So, you’d better deliver your kids to a place where there’s kittens and games
So they can abandon the quest for your missing remains
I’m a tsunami, you’re a typical wave, a hurricane to the drizzling rain
If it’s the clique that I claim, kid, it’s The Plague
And the Plague is the plizzle, listen to this official issue
QN5 is the game, Tonedeff is the ref with the whistle
Simple? Never! Bitch we’re just so clever
This goes out to Meddafore, who’s sorta like the world because he’ll spin forever
Flow as sinful as a bimbo legs open, whole ass up in your hands so gentle
Cameras click to capture this, so I can pit your past against you
Any attempt on me, you’ll thoroughly abort
Cause you’ll catch it before it happens, like Minority Report
I’m sure to be recorded as one of the nastiest, most technical
Flashiest, spectacle, cats seen yet to flow
Tracks you pressed in bulk, lack in respectable
Craft, Just let it go, Masters shoulda' been left in your trash receptacle
That’s incredible! We let em know!
