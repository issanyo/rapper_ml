[Tonedeff, sung]
I’m fascinated by you
I’m fascinated by you
I’m fascinated by you
The way you are

In light, I will define you
A portrait of a hologram
I see, but I can’t feel you
Cause you’re so far away

I’m fascinated by you
I’m fascinated by you
I’m fascinated by you
And you’re so far

I reach through your projection
Your image lingers on my hands
I feel the lost connection
I pause to count the frames

I’m fascinated by you
I’m fascinated by you
I’m fascinated by you
And you’re so far

In light, I will define you
A portrait of a hologram
I see, but I can’t feel you
Cause you’re so far away

I’m fascinated by you
I’m fascinated by you
I’m fascinated by you
And you’re so far

I reach through your projection
Your image lingers on my hands
I feel the lost connection
I pause to count the frames

I’m fascinated by you
I’m fascinated by you
I’m fascinated by you
And you’re so far

In light, I will define you
A portrait of a hologram
I see, but I can’t feel you
Cause you’re so far away

I’m fascinated by you
I’m fascinated by you
I’m fascinated by you
And you’re so far

I reach through your projection
Your image lingers on my hands
I feel the lost connection
I pause to count the frames

[Tonedeff]
We’re connected, in a dream that we both can perceive
Feel my loneliness breathe as I hold your reflection
What a tease, should be close here with me
And it’s so inconvenient to go this direction
No reprieve, cause it’s solely a means
To control this unease, yet it’s slow, ineffective
And the speech seems to choke the reception
But we know what it means
If we don’t intervene and proceed with this show
We can easily fold, it’ll leave us exposed and defenseless
The amnesia will grow, memories seem to mold
And it seems that we’re prone to forget shit
And the details that glow like it’s heat from the coals
Will recede in the cold if neglected
Though our reach is remote and electric
No, I still really don't see us as separate
And I believe this whole screen is an entrance
The only thing that soaks me in your essence
Even though, you’re free to roam, we only tend to
Be at home, keeping our phones ringing and texting
You would think it was OCD, relentless
We can’t leave us alone, seeking attention
To each his own, to me you’re so sweet it's infectious
Need to go see to my row of teeth to the dentist
You complete us, the fourth piece in a Tetris
Your qualities that I quote read like a checklist
Yet there’s reasons to fold and be apprehensive
Sexless seasons get old, it feels like a sentence
And I scheme like dope fiend when he’s desperate
But you’re feeding my soul, I teeter on ethics
We have chosen the key to throw deep in the trenches
Clinging to hope indeed, with no belief in an exit
That’s when we get aggressive
Being defensive, no one’s cheating – we’re guessing
Beasts in a tempest roaring, screaming and venting
Leading with questions, do you feel the effects festering?
We’re decreasing our presence, teaching a lesson
Posed like other’s dead, till the grief is immense
No amount of meters can measure the steepness or depth
When what we’re too weak to express gets between
In a heap of regrets, exceedingly vexed
Getting nosebleeds from the stress
Which leaves the impression there’s no more steam in the engine
If it’s meant to end, who are we to reject destiny?
Don’t repeat what I said yet, heed it in jest
All this is a meaningful test, let’s reap what is left when
We sow the seeds of depression
If we can attest the remedy is a rest next to me
So many people are skeptic to see
If love can linger when stretched this extreme
Perceived from their perspective from recent events
And the scene is intense, but it tends to deceive
Cause what appears to be senseless succeeds
When we are near we’re possessed, hence the heat
That is unequaled, it’s legend, it weakens our legs
And it rings in our heads and prevents us from sleep
And so our greed is incentive to keep
Pressing and leaning ahead, set to meet
But in the meantime, expect that I will greet you in bed
As you set within the west, and I ascend in the east
And still we need this repression to cease
My heart’ll beat like a freshman’s – with speed
When I’m swept from the stream and caressed by the breeze
And the relief that I will get when your projection’s released
When your projection’s released
When your projection’s released
When your projection’s released
