[Verse 1]
The premises get vacated… The millisecond I kill the seven niggas that play jaded
Within a record I chill the tepid temperatures they’ve created
With their pitiful minimal efforts to make statements
I spit on em got em shelling out money to cover their late payments
Cause they’re way dated, these dumb motherfuckers have never paid dues, and believing that they’ve made it
For as long as Im repping intelligent lyrics I figure I’ll stay hated
But my mindframe is to remain patient
With niggas posing about as hard as a stripper’s nipples on stage naked
Yo, I can’t take it, I’m keeping em plummeting toward the bottom like stocks that’s daytraded
Net-fiasco’s, Get these asshole’s fates tainted
Flaming & relocating just like gay vagrants
Tone slays the giants, like my legal name’s David
What I say’s blatant, no apologies necessary to glaze the game blazing
Touch overdubs or change the phrasing
Lyrically maintaining, jugular vein’s straining
Tonedeff adds to the pressure with bass so deep it makes your brains cave in
I’ll break it down for the laymen, for the niggas that ain’t acing the basic training
My rations got their trays swaying
Galleries use my verses for page framing
Cause, hey I stay flagrant with lyrics nastier than Tammy Faye bathing
Keep comp shook like charter plane when it’s raining
I stay phat on the underground like there was a buffet in the main basement
Sometimes I be slaying for entertainment
Cause, yo, Im outclassing motherfuckers, without ever having to weigh in

The Heavyweight Pro with the heavyweight flow!

[Verse 2]
No one’s as gifted or as vigorously meticulous with a writtern scripture
Or spits with this infinite syllablism that I’ve been equipped with
Should I quit with the quick shit or pitch shift a negative 50% in an effort to get rich
Or stick with the swiftness for the niggas that get this
Even when I’m simplistic, I can be unbelievably cryptic
The rhythm endures the physical force to split a tree with a discuss
With the ease of a flicked wrist, your soul can be seized from a distance
In an instant by this plague affiliate that’s seething with sickness
I seem to get listless with these kids when I see what they dismiss
Cause anything missing a punchline’ll get eased outta business
Like delivery’s not important! Rhythm and rhyme schemes are ignored it’s horrid
Son, if you can’t flow then become a comedian a ghost writer or poet
If you ain’t repping the art-form then don’t record it
Heads are starving and fiending for an assortment of global proportions
If you ain’t feeding the scores of supporters, then you’re hoarding
And you’re a whore that’s killing your heritage like Lizzie Borden
The dexterity I display scrambles your cells like you was a dizzy warden
Committed to scoring more than a jiggy Mormon
With a diamond studded bible that bling-blings in the sunlight
When I rhyme at full throttle, I’m titled “Supreme Being” when I come tight
And these things are finally done right
Like obscene scenes riding your slut wife
Our extreme flings stifle your love life
Stun like blunt strikes from a swung pipe someone was hiding from sight
And exceed speeds of fire in gunfights

[Hook] 2X

[Verse 3]
And you can bank on it! The playing odds’ll stay solid
If you remain brolic with name calling, leave with a ganked wallet
I take solace in making profits like fake scholars
That want you to waste dollars for paid knowledge in state college
With great prowess, I face off with and shank cowards
And waste all their debased followers, break laws with a brave heart like the late Wallace
I chase robbers, escaped convicts who rape songs and create garbage
Embrace carnage, they ain’t artists! Sample their flavor and you’ll taste vomit!
[Gasp] I need a reminder to intake oxygen
Space-Polymer based oxidants.. Say hot shit, display confidence
Hey audience! [BREATHE!!] Just wave arms till it’s plain obvious
Play God, and persuade crowds to behave honest and pay homage
And pray thoughtlessly awful authors are marked for death like stained coffins
I keep clean cause I bathe often and never illegally trade documents
Hate-mongers, repent! Let me set it straight!
I’m the heavyweight, like long lines in front of a Jenny Craig or Weight Watchers!
