[Intro: Tonedeff]
Good afternoon Bocha. It's 4 o'clock. Do you know where your hip hop is? You better believe it's at the Phila Flava show! Ho! We 'bout to get into it. QN5 Music 'bout to do it. Tonedeff, Deacon The Villain y'all. Let's do it up

[Deacon The Villain]
The show is so fresh got Mr. Clean asking for tips
Over your radio waves, Phila Flav, battling ships
You in the wrong candy shop seeking to satisfy lips
They strictly eargasms, drip drip drip
Commercially elusive, the music's exclusive
You think Hurricane Hugo came through, the show is so ruthless
Tweak your speakers
Equalize your acoustics
Prepare eardrums for some new hits

[Tonedeff]
I'm introducing Houston
And it's the Phila Flava crew sending
Frequency's that's easier to pick up than loose women
Tuned in to 91.7
That's W ow (who?)
W ow (who?)
Yo y'all need to be cutting it out
I'm busted around a case and jar for Kevlar and Jason Gloss and Crisis
You ain't feeling the Phila? Then your taste is off
To brace your cough [?] my favorite part is this quick spelling
It's QN5 Music y'all, no rich relatives

[PackFM]
Hot verse y'all Tone you killed it
High five, way to go
My name is PackFM, it's only right I'm on the radio
Do me a favor though
Turn up Phila Flava
It's a Friday afternoon, you ain't gonna wake your neighbor
Everyone on my team
Shining bright like high beams
Philaflava.com
The archive, the live streams
Exclusives and classic freestyles and interviews
Phila Flava's who ya listen to so let's conclude the interlude
