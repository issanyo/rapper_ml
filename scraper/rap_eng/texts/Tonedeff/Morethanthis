Yo
I think everybody has a moment that defines their lives
And I had mine
Actually let me just tell you about it...

[Verse 1: Tonedeff]
It goes a little something like this
I was turning 17
I was prolly the most popular kid that my school had ever seen
I was the flavor of the future
Man, it’s the future and I can’t taste a thing
I’m 23 years old now
Still chasing the same dream at 17
I watched some folks around me blow up
And I’m still right here
Doing nothing. Aspiring. Trying
But there’s something inside me
And I’ve always felt so meaningful
There’s nothing more that I wanna prove to you
It’s that I’m morethanthis

[Chorus: Tonedeff]
I’m morethanthis
Yeah, I’m morethanthis
You know I wanna be morethanthis
Alright now, morethanthis
Give me a chance now, morethanthis
You know I wanna be morethanthis
More than a no-one, morethanthis
I’ve got something. Yeah

[Verse 2: Tonedeff]
About a year after which, I was no longer a novelty
People no longer changed who they are for me
A celebrity hardly
And I was working at Best Buy, selling CDs
When a friend of mine sees me
And disturbs me deeply, saying
“Hey, Hey! Whatever happened to Mr. Arsenio Hall?”
As if working there was quite the fall from grace
I had to disguise my face
Cause I was totally disgraced, by my fate
And my place in life
If you were really my friend, you would know I’m
Morethanthis

[Chorus: Tonedeff]
You should know I'm morethanthis
Muthafucka I'm morethanthis
Nigga you should know I'm morethanthis
Everybody I'm morethanthis
So many things, I'm morethanthis
You should know I'm morethanthis
This ain't the end yall, morethanthis
And you should know I'm morethanthis
My mama thinks I'm morethanthis
My daddy knows I'm morethanthis
My baby knows I'm morethanthis
My friends know I'm morethanthis
And you should know I'm morethanthis
