[Intro]
Ayo, this is what rhyming's about
Line for line, dying to come out
So you can't deny it or doubt
Signed or unsigned, trying to come out
In case you gotta rhyme in a bout
Then on every line you can count
Ayo, this is what rhyming's about
Line for line, dying to come out
So you can't deny it or doubt
Signed or unsigned, trying to come out
In case you gotta rhyme in a bout
Then on every line you can count

[Verse 1: Substantial]
Lyrically deep like the teachings of Confucius
Spit ridiculous shit, like a nipple-less tit - you're useless
But hang around anyway hoping to get flow
Lyrically acidic when I spit it, making mics melt
I should change my name to Phillip 'cause I'm screwing you up
Like chicks with tongue piercings I'm assuming you suck
Plus, I'm the chosen one, you're feeling me like trinity
But you ain't ready to see me lose it, like your daughter's virginity

[Verse 2: Wordsworth]
Now these are similes, stop mixing the two
An asshole - no talent - that's a metaphor, a description of you
You said it was reviews in newspapers that pushed your album back
But it wouldn't have come out quicker if you induced labor
If you said something doper, I'd probably quote ya
But nothing sticks, like putting the opposite sides of magnets closer
The demographics of where my rap hits
Towers of above my peers, from where I control air traffic

[Verse 3: PackFM]
Eargasmic lyrics - multiples is what my verses give
You ain't a fan? Then I'm serving educational purposes
You always enter tournaments, always lose in round one
Somebody must have lost a wack MC 'cause I just found one
It ain't like you're trash - but you're far from dope, man
You're somewhere in the middle, chillin' with Monie & Malcom
Your label's fronting on the dough, and they ain't paying
You couldn't get burn if satan gave you rotation on his station

[Hook]
It's Substantial, and the contract on your life is non-negotiable
('Cause every word I say should be a hip-hop quotable)
Wordsworth is the reason you're not spoken to
('Cause every word I say should be a hip-hop quotable)
If I battled you and all your fans, I guess that means I'm ripping both of you
('Cause every word I say should be a hip-hop quotable)
Session is the reason that your bitch not close to you
('Cause every word I say should be a hip-hop quotable)

[Verse 4: Session]
Ayo, words travel like Magellan does, you on top? Dead it cuz
If you're over me - you must have fell in love
Puff an L and bug, 'cause I won't be swatted
I can't be seen - I'll be a dalmation and still won't be spotted
'Cause in raps, you're played
Your piece of shit raps get bitch-slapped
Till it's all pitch black like Satchel Paige
Session - and I must be dissing a tramp
You can pull your dick out and still piss on your pants

[Verse 5: Supastition]
Man, nobody likes me, I performed two songs and most hate it
I'm despised by the heavens, my tombstone is post-dated
I told flex he had to wait to get my album, but I guess he can't
'Cause they caught him and Clue breaking in the pressing plant
I'm smacking ya, 'cause you ain't really said nothing spectacular
'Yo! You heard what he said?' - NOPE! I just remember how wack it was
Who the fuck did your vocals? Man, what studio you pay
They made it sound like your mic was six studios away

[Verse 6: Rise]
Man, if you seen one MC on the scene, that's at least three
When they say the man is holding them down, they mean me
I'm like, "Lemme find out" things I already know
Like writers have to take a vote with what line to quote
That's horribly said - In, on, or off of your head
You gets no love! Who would talk you off of a ledge?
Because it looks and sounds like what you're spitting is hard
Special effects make you tougher like the Wizard of Oz

[Hook]
Session is the reason that your bitch not close to you
('Cause every word I say should be a hip-hop quotable)
You might say that you're better than Rise, but that's a load of bull
('Cause every word I say should be a hip-hop quotable)
Oh, now you wanna give up rhyming - you're long overdue
('Cause every word I say should be a hip-hop quotable)
The name is Tonedeff and these chickens be on the totem pole
('Cause every word I say should be a hip-hop quotable)

[Verse 7: Tonedeff]
Question... how do you call an MC nice, via the phone line?
Pick up and at the sound of the tone, just dial 3 four times
And speak after the beep or chime
And leave more mixed messages than, um
Tony Hawk's dentist, when telling him, "Please Don't Grind"
I reach bold heights that Sikhs won't find
Give guide dogs to rap wannabe's on sight, 'cause I tend to beat foes blind
Don't mind your eyebrows, that'll regrow fine
As far as your life. I got a leash on yours and a new lease on mine
As far as your wife, well, she's easily occupied
You see, your girl got a lazy eye, and she's seeing me on the side
Quote me up in your thesis, I deserve a trophy for some of these quips
You're surrounded by pussies like you're the only brother of 3 kids
Whoa! Holy Mother of Jesus! you got a soccer mom?
I'm the goalie tucked in her cleavage, yelling 'Defense!'
You'd think your sense of listening was sent to prison
'Cause I captivate minds with the strength to hold a genie against his wishes
I'm genius with these renditions mental attrition
Known for flowing longer than the Lord of the Rings director's cut special edition
So, step to the front, next if you're wishing
Claiming you got heart, but in regards to your flow, it seems there's a ventricle missing
Crab rappers with no clause in their contract and their genitals itching
Got me saying 'Pause' more than any general Vets assistant
So I go solo with no problem
While you got so many guests appearances, that you made a cameo on your own album

[Outro]
Check it, check it, check it out and you know we don't stop
It's Q, QN5 with the real hip hop, we don't-
Don't play on the way to the top
We just rock the fuck out, y'all
Rock the fuck out, y'all
Check it, check it, check it out and you know we don't stop
It's Q, QN5 with the real hip hop, we don't-
Don't play on the way to the top
We just rock the fuck out, y'all
Rock the fuck out, y'all
