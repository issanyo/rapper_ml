[Verse 1]
This the shit that blow out your speakers
Scuff up your sneakers
Cause a traffic jam, start a riot in the bleachers
When I was young we used to throw chairs at the teachers
Now we slide past the bouncers like they was guidance counselors
The clique you was down for is quick to denounce ya
Cause you ain't doin' shit right dog, like a southpaw
I'm rollin' with outlaws, who crack jaws without cause
Now it's a blockbuster night, it ain't safe outdoors

[Hook]
Get up, stand up, come on throw your hands up
This here's the place and right now's the time
Get up, stand up, come on throw your hands up
If you came to chill then take it outside
Now, who came to stomp (Hey!)
We give you what you want (Hey!)
Let's take it from the top now Stomp (Hey!) Stomp (Hey!)
Who came to stomp (Hey!)
We give you what you want (Hey!)
Let's take it from the top now Stomp (Hey!) Stomp (Hey!)

[Verse 2]
Now we at war with these bastards, make room for the draft pick
Caskets get crafted for thinkin it's just rap shit
You wanna match wits, shiiiiiiiiit, you can't handle it
You soft, when you laid your verse, the vocal booth was candle lit
Now hold up, it's to much, these dicks think they too (2) nuts
And only rap because they too pussy to shoot they school up
I leave you fitted, spinnin' your screw mug with 2 lumps
So if you wanna get it, we queued up, just move up

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My whole squad's so raw, we knock down your door
Leave you on the floor, screamin' out "No more!"
So hold it down, it's over now
There's no more rounds, we hold the crown
We can't be stopped
We made it hot, this ain't for props
We came to rock, and claimed our spot
And set up shop, your time is up
Just check the clock and if you waitin' on us to drop
Then take your shots, aim for the top

[First Half of Hook]
Get up, stand up, come on throw your hands up
This here's the place and right now's the time
Get up, stand up, come on throw your hands up
If you came to chill then take it outside
Stomp
