[Hook: Tori Amos]
Circles and circles and circles again
The girls in Circles and circles
Got to stop spinning

[Verse One: Tonedeff]
Young beautiful girls, Professional Widows and models
Candy facial expressions, figure impressions of bottles
Novelties jettin’ full-throttle, vivacious to view through goggles
Vibrant, though minds-Conniving, a style aficionado
I don’t wanna lose ‘em all, the lover eyes of a doll
Hot, erotic, she got it, putting Butterflies in my gull
She’s got my sense spinning, like a nickel in rotation
With no modulation, the type of pussy to form a nation
Many bitches give the round around and claim that they’re not able
“I can’t kiss on the first date.” But still be dancing naked on some tables
Claim the families behind you, but you’ve spoken much too fast
Cause your mom and your cousin, too, claim you’re just an outkast

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Tonedeff]
Round & Round ‘n’, contemplating
Circulating like the earth be in rotation
She’s the object of my fascination and brothers around me
Got my mind in the jungle, but girl, I’ll house you like the county
I met this Honey named Tori, A-MOSt wicked scam
Who was the Waitress at the Little Amsterdam with Talula and Marianne
Who used to run together like the Horses ran
But, Tori always used to seem like she was in The Wrong Band
Began the format to rap the Precious Things in her ear
Like, you’ve been Here. In My Head, but I’ve been Silent All These Years
I’ve had this Cloud On My Tongue, understand where I be coming from?
It’s something I wanted to say before she moved to London
It’s been a “Pretty Good Year,” she said, “I went to China
All the way to New York.” Her travels seemed to make her finer
She said she was Past the Mission of gaining my recognition
Cause she thought she was a Cornflake Girl in competition
With them raisin chicks, who turned to Icicles in Winter
I had to begin to express all the times she’s been the center
Of my Thoughts, with Little Earthquakes bringing me to my knees
I figured she was acting cold because she Caught A Lite Sneeze

[Bridge: Tori Amos]
“Thought I was over the bridge now”

[Verse Three: Tonedeff]
She’s got me going in circles, 360 degrees-easy
Sometimes, she be colder than ice to freeze the pleas
Of my being one of her L-O-V-E’s, But see, degrees vary in her
So, to win her, I’ma spin her with my flows
Think of the times she rolls around my way
But, hey, what can I say, I see her every other day
And damn her face, it’s a disgrace when I can’t even write a rhyme
Cause every time I find I’m dreaming of her creaming in my mind
In position… it blurs my vision every time she pass
‘Is the mission just to get glasses or wax that ass?”
But it’s like, her candle never had a fire to light
So, my dick is the wick and I’ll be catching some matches tonight
She be that two-faced bitch, that switches her hips like mood swings
Giving head to the winningest team on campus, but still has time to be queen of the prom scene/
Obscene as it may seem as an objective/
Brothers have tried to reject it, but that ass is yet to be neglected/
She’s not the girl from Ipanema sipping ZIMA
She be that rave bitch that’s at the disco sippin’ Cisco in her daddy’s Beamer
So if she really wants to take you for a spin
She’s good for nothing but the Holiday Inn
We’re in circles
