[Verse 1]
You are the warden, though you say you’re not – I say you are
You got me numbering my days in solitary
But you don’t know what I’ve been plotting for you
Once I chip my way beyond your prison walls

I used to have a soul until you snatched it all
You are the warden of my heart
You’ll be the last to know that you don’t have control
You are the warden of my heart

You used to tell me I was someone you could trust with love
But nowadays, you barely trust me to one phone call
Hey! Girl, you leave me cuffed to the walls
And leave with the front door open

[Hook]
Give me the blue sky, give me the sunlight
Give me your loving, baby
Give me the key to let me go – Oh let me go
You are the warden of my heart

[Verse 2]
Another night another, another lonesome day
I keep on calling but you won’t come (hey hey hey)
Though you’re only inches away
Where’s your mind go

This ain’t no shawshank baby
There’s no redemption baby
I’m simply guilty, no parole in your system for me/
But I don’t wanna say a word, we know to be true
Cause I’ve already lied to serve my sentence for you

It’s so illogical, (yeah)
We barely talk at all (yeah)
It’s strictly conjugal (yeah)
Our hearts are cold and thoughts have gone astray
I can’t stay – Not this way

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now, you’ve got a lock and key
Sometimes it seems you’ve got it out for me
Cause no matter what anyone says, surely I can see
Mama, you run a lopsided democracy
How in the hell am I possibly thought to be shocked
When we got different philosophies
It’s hard to meet in the middle, when you belittle the issues we live through
And If I don’t agree you stomp your feet
I wish that there was a way that I could bill you for my loss of sleep
Cause I ain’t counted a fucking flock in weeks
Ironically, you pulled the wool over my eyes
Surprise, you ain’t he lady I thought you’d be
Props for being deceptive, but I think I’ma need an intervention
Cause I don’t wanna stop feeling you top of me
Sitting across my cheeks, devouring the very spot that keeps
My force your hungry for you, like I was an ‘aqua teen’
Now, rock with me, master your shake
Plans to escape are being botched as we speak
Tired of comparing apples and oranges, cause the fact is we’re always just
Avoiding having to harvest honesty
When there’s lots of grief that we cause to eachother
We gotta stop the bleeding or you can watch me leave
And break, cause whether you like it or not, I’ll be damned if I let this loss repeat
And there’s plenty of other sharks in the sea
