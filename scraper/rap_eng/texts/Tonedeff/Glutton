[Hook]
One is not enough, I’m a glutton
Wanna take it all till there’s nothing
Grasping at the bottom when I plunge in
Never sleep because I’m always huntin - for more
Nothing is ever enough, because I am a gl-u-tton
Oh - Consumption is my only function
If I run out, then I’m cuffing whatever you’re clutching
Never sleep because I’m always huntin for more

[Verse 1]
Mmmm
And I got that craving for it
But I’m not depraved, well sorta
When I’m out surveying sources
For one of my most favorite courses
Oh, I just want a tasty morsel
Starving off this aching torture
And the emptiness makes me nauseous
Till I’m sedated with weighty portions
Oh, but I’m aiming for more
And it never seems that I get a fill - It’s the same as before
Then, whatever grabs onto my appetite, chase the allure
And I’m expanding my palate, till there’s pain in my jaw – awwww
I wanna it taste all, and masticate the mass decay
No trash or waste involved
A hasty mauling, place the staw in, savor the sauce
Till the flavor dissolves and I wanna scrape the walls

[Hook]
One is not enough, I’m a glutton
Wanna take it all till there’s nothing
Grasping at the bottom when I plunge in
Never sleep because I’m always huntin - for more
Nothing is ever enough, because I am a gl-u-tton
Oh - Consumption is my only function
If I run out, then I’m cuffing whatever you’re clutching
Never sleep because I’m always huntin for more

[Verse 2]
I gotta get another goodie, yup, but I gather
It’s gonna be grimy going the way that it be going down
I’m gonna give my gums a grueling goal on behalf of my stomach
That’s growling - notice the gain in the groans and growls
It’s giving me grief
But grinning is easy when I be gritting my teeth
So don’t gimme no guilt trip, cause I know it’s an illness
That’s explodes with the real risks of grilling with grease
And this guttural call to gluttony’s all I know
Cold - sputtering on the brink
So gully, whore lust, more numbing, monopoly board money scores
Color me raw in pink
The onus on me, is oh sloppy
Yet folks’ll copy this soulless zombie
In a swollen body, only a hearty appetite for more
But at my core there’s a hole with no heartbeat
UGH!

[Bridge X3]
I want it all and I want it – now
Your heart, your soul, your doubt
Everything that’s breathing out
Gets crushed in my mouth

[Verse 3]
I'm shameless
And I won't get sober, theres no leftovers
No matter what the state of my plate is
Hey this needless want is evil huh? but I need and want it
A precipice I never teeter on
Cause I seem to fall in deep to the balls when I heed the calling
We've evolved from a cauldron
Where each and all reach and crawl for the profits
And breach the walls, trying to keep what you've got
Yes, you'll feel the gnaw reaching down for your wallet
And I got a fever for the flavor of a kill
If I'm gonna meet my maker, then intaking his creation whole... filled
With a cheshire cat grin, and my deeds purged for him to discover
Like... Please sir, can I have another?

[Hook]
One is not enough, I’m a glutton
Wanna take it all till there’s nothing
Grasping at the bottom when I plunge in
Never sleep because I’m always huntin - for more
Nothing is ever enough, because I am a gl-u-tton
Oh - Consumption is my only function
If I run out, then I’m cuffing whatever you’re clutching
Never sleep because I’m always huntin for more

[Outro X3]
I want it all, and I want it now
