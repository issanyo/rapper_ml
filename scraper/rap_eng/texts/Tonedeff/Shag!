C'mon baby I'm a rolling stone
I want to conversate
I want to take you home
And if you want to take up on and ride its on
I want to shag baby (shag baby)
Shag baby (shag baby)

[Hook]
You know you want it
You know you fiending for it
C'mon get on it
I feel your body heat
Cause I'm a swinger
And I just want to please ya
I know you want it
I know you fiending for it

Hey ladies!
Hey yo its time to wild out
Slide on your tight blouse
And dress like it was 105 out
Y'all coming to my house
And we're going to shag baby
Mad crazy, stack ladies
"You going to call me tomorrow?"
Yea maybe
Hey fellas!
Don't miss the call to come through
There'll be about 70 women its wall to wall
All are ready to jump you
Son you ain't seen these chicks long in the stair wells
Flaunting their bare selves
The situation's sticker than Mary's hair gel
You'll have to wear bells
To find your way back to the heads that you came with
And spit game with a blindfold
Without bumping into the same chick
Down in the basement they got lace whips
And up on the roof top
We be keeping the goods hot
Cause ladies know we got the wood-stock
It's all love
But don't expect your valentines this year
Remember to spread the joy with pals of mine
When they get here
And its clear, you bout to get your hot zone showered
The name is Tonedeff
But you can call me Aus-Tone Powers
Cause I'm a swinger baby

[Hook]
C'mon baby I'm a rolling stone
I want to conversate
I want to take you home
And if you want to take up on and ride its on
I want to shag baby (Shag baby)
Shag baby (Shag baby)

Let's keep it moving y'all
Hey the hell with the inhibitions
Really nobody's watching (what?)
You can tell from the mixed positions
Distance isn't a factor
When your bodies are stacked up
Especially when the jacuzzi gets packed
And there's fat bastards trapped in the bath tub
I'm asking for backrubs and receiving a bull body massage
Hey I'm shagadelic (What?) that's my hobby and job
If you don't want to be down then you're probably a snob
Get out and get gone
I'll show you Victoria secrets
Without the bra and the thong
You be knocking my boxers off
Lets play doctor, you visit me
Strip and shimmy please
I need to examine you physically
I'm an international man of mystery
I shag and then *Poof*
Got Carmen Sandiego wondering
Where in the world I went to
I sent you, the invite to this function
You know the one of the pic of my bedroom
That's used for Kamasutra instructions
You want to get hustling on this rush for lust?
You can ride with us
My goldmember's got the Midas touch

[Hook x2]
I'm a swinger baby
You know you want it (I'm a swinger yeah)
You know you fiending for it (Said I'm a swinger baby)
C'mon get on it (I'm a swinger yeah)
I feel your body heat (Said I'm a swinger baby)
Cause I'm a swinger (I'm a swinger yeah)
And I just want to please ya (Said I'm a swinger baby)
I know you want it (A swinger baby)
I know you fiending for it (Yea)

[4x]
C'mon you know you want to just
Swi-swing it with me
Swing it biatch!

[Hook]
C'mon baby I'm a rolling stone
I want to conversate
I want to take you home
And if you want to take up on and ride its on
I want to shag baby (Shag baby)
Shag baby (Shag baby)
