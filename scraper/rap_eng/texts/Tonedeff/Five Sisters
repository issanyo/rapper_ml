I got five sisters, tied to one mother
Five different sides to uncover
Pick a part of her personality, each
And develop whoever you want to be
I got five sisters, all in one line
Five gifts in all to combine
Trace it to the root of our family tree
And here’s how each one is unique, listen

Sister #1 had it rough
And she took the brunt of the punishment, cause she was the first of the bunch
To an underage mother, who was tough
No wonder she’d rush to married, at barely 16, and very young
She’d become the disciplinarian, but
The symptoms of the repression she suffered, would bubble over in lust
After a couple of marriages go bust
She struggles with different daughters who mimicked her, just as mother had done

Sister number #2’s sad news
The first out of four from my mother’s schizophrenic husband #2
The rumored most beautiful one of the group
In her unending quest for attention, she had a penchant for bad dudes
Who ruined her her magic with baggies and booze
And would lose the pure magnetism, and attraction that her mother exudes
She mentally never grew out of her youth
As the master manipulator, of the ladies, she knew -

And you can be whoever you want
So you can get whatever you need
And you can be whoever you want
So you can get whatever you need

Sister #3 is Geneva
In times of war, she’s the center where the rest of them meet up
#2 would beat up her self esteem with a stream of grief
Saying that she was an overweight underachiever. and #3’d believe her ---
See - as a teen she married a dealer who’d mistreat her
Who later OD’d, to leave her with babies to feed
In need of a man she can keep, the pattern repeats, there’s talent beneath
Her broken mentality keeps her from all things that she dreams of

Sister #4 is our noah
The spiritual core - the enormous weight of it all - is too much to hold up
The only one with no sons or daughters and so she’s focused
The last to get married, first to graduate, perfect persona
So, opinions matter more - they control her - and that alone is her torture
So, fashion forward, it masking her frazzled aura for show
But the fact she’s mostly at home alone, and won’t pick the phone
Says the difficult role has been choking her growing older

Sister #5 is the fighter
Though the other 4 would pull out a knife to defend the others with no wind-up
If you saying something sly just to slight us
#5 will prolly blind you while driving, she’s got the eye of the tiger
This lioness’ll ride or die for her pride
And she thriving on trying times, she’ll always find a way to survive in a bind
She made it a decade, with her guy doing time, and she’s by your side
But god forbid, you cross her line, with a forgiveness too high to climb

Now, it’s important to observe -
That the force of nature that birthed us, made "mother" more than a word
There’s so many states of this person, though some distortions occurred
That each of us absorbed a portion, in turn, we form into her
To secure our places and worth, this cunning runs in our genes
So we can change into different faces when it comes to our needs
I've got 5 sisters, but 6 mothers indeed
Cause each one of them was a mother to me

[Hook]
And you can be whoever you want
So what you get whatever you need
And you can be whoever you want
So what you get whatever you need

These pieces of me are yours, so own them
