There is nothing left when I’m inside out
But I can walk through anything
I disappear from pictures in my house
But I can run through everything
Everything, everything

And I had to crawl through it all
So I could feel the loss peeling off
And I have no armor at all
And I feel so raw. Is this real or false?

I’m running through those walls
Away
Away

Nothing hurts when I’m inverted
Nothing hurts when I’m inverted

Nothing can contain me
Nothing can escape me
Nothing that can hold me down
I’d have to die to show you how
Till then just let me see this through
Till then just let me breathe through you
Till then you’ll know that I’m around
Even though I won’t be found
