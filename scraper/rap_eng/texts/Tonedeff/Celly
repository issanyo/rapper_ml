Can You Hear Me Now? Good

[V1 - Tone]
Yo, it's Sunday afternoon, and I've been hibernating thoroughly
Lying beside my girl who's been trying to wake me urgently
With a stern sermon about wasting my day
Knowing that if I don't force me outta bed with a crowbar I'll lazily stay
I wake up.kinda sorta.today's when the guys come over
To write, so I head out to get some pizza and buy us soda
Wireless phone to my ear, giving session a buzz
"Yo, Sesh, it's Tone, you want anything? I'm buying us grub"

[Session]
What?! you lyin in blood? (Tone) "yeah, and call Pack to wake him up"
(Session) Yo, you breakin up! STAN! They tryin to take his stuff!
(Stan) Word? then I got bones to crack, (Session) Lets split up
You bring Tone intact. I'mma get up, on the phone wit Pack
*Dialing* (Pack voicemail) "Its Pack, leave a message"
(Session) "I can't believe this, pick up!, its me, its Session!
Tone got robbed and we tryin to reach you man
Hit me back on the hip or speak to Stan!"

[Pack]
Tones got cracked ribs from gettin beat by Stan???
I knew one day, these egos would get outta hand
Looks like me and sesh are the only ones with level heads
Fuck it lemme call Stan and see if we can settle this [*dialing sound in background*]
(Stans FRANTIC VOICE) "hello?!!?" (Pack) Stan, you alright? What's up with you and Tone?"
(Stan *pissed*) "Yo, pack you mumblin again!? Son, you need to get a better phone"
(Pack) Yeah, I know you hate Tone, Session left me a message explainin'
(Stan MORE FRANTIC) "WHAT! session got hit by a train???????"
(*Stan hangs up)

Jesus H Christ man I was just with'em
(crying) I figured he'd OD...who would think a train kill'em
What a horrible way to go! Just think
He just moved away from home. Rest in peace
Yo, I've gotta save Tone we ain't loosing him too
(Gets angry) I'm puting foot in somebody ass until they shit shoe
For trying to stick crew [*phone rings] Hello! (Tone) "Ayo, Stan, it's Tone"
(Stan) Since when do muggers stop to let you use the phone!!!

Yo, Stan is looking for you man, you told me your were getting jacked!"
(Tone) Jacked? Nah, man, I'm headed to the beach to rest & relax
