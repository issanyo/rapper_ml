[Intro]
Fear is nothing more than a feeling
You feel hot
You feel hungry
You feel angry
You feel afraid
Fear can never kill you

[Verse 1: Tonedeff]
Now who’s afraid of the big bad wolf?
That’s if you can admit it if you get that shook
Cause everyone’s been in a bit of a pinch that looked a bit bad
Couldn’t predict that you would live past where you stood
I’m scared of God coming back, asking if I’ve read his big black book
While I’m mid-splash up in a bitch’ ass in a bath room
Nothing gets stashed if you live crass under a glass roof
I’m afraid, but I act natural. On tours I can’t sleep
Hoping there’s nothing we crash through, while on board in the back seat
Since I nearly lost my life and my wife in a taxi
The echos of the impact retroactively attack me
I’m afraid of having a baby that lacks feet
Afraid of rugged terrain and plunging a plane head first in a vast sea
I’m afraid of any school-aged child that packs heat
Or the feeling of not being able to wake up from a bad dream
I’m afraid of wasting years of my life on this rap scene
Or Seeing my mother pass without grasping the brass ring
So many tragedies happen in mass on the flat screen
But it’s never as real as hearin’ your family’s last screams
Cause god didn’t make us to die! (so what?)
So fear is an interim instinct given to keep us alive
So when you feel the chills reel up your spine
And the adrenaline fills you, don’t stress
Cause fear can still kill you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mecca]
I’m known as a brave guy
But to say I’m fearless is to say lies
Some I might have until my days die
My fears are few, but powerful
When the days done and your demons come to devour you and kill if you allow them to
Feelings I’m familiar with known as a grown man
Heart pounding will make your spine shudder like a cold hand
Nothing logical about it, wild, irrational, makin' your mind clouded
Can you explain yours? I doubt it
Why do thoughts of failure make me uptight
I don’t swim
Cause the fear drowning wakes me up nights
I don’t win
Stare the nightmare in the eye when I stood at my pop’s grave
Was not afraid of death, but with his I was not brave
He was proud but didn’t live to see me a make hot stage
I cry to see his pride when I rock and got praised
That’s why I spot days, it’s more than a clock’s hours
Refusal let the fear block power

[Verse 3: Session]
Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo I’m 23 started writing in my late-teens
Got with PMD’s Hitsquad when I was 18
Thinkin' I’m the nicest
My first song of great means
Naive, thinkin' I’m one step away from this great dream
Had plans for the top even had fans on my jock
Listenin' to my old shit, I know why my manager stopped callin'
Gotta take advantages, not often niggas want to put you on
I need a hand just to stop fallin'
Fall away from my dreams
And I didn’t go to college cause your boy was supposed to go all the way to the green
All the way to the scene of Biggie’s performance on ‘The Show'
Imagine I saw my face on the screen, damn
I try to tell myself “I won’t fail"
But if I do ain’t no "Oh well"
What the fuck do I do if I don’t sell?
I’m scared that I’m wasting my life being Joe Schmoe with no dough
I'mma take a .44 and I’m wasting my life, fuck that

[Hook]

[Verse 4: PackFM]
You may think I’m frontin', but let me tell you I ain’t scared of nothin'
And nowadays you always gotta be prepared for somethin'
Cause life is a game that we play
The chips fall where they may but most times you don’t land where you want to
There were days when I would have said I was afraid of heights
When I was younger I couldn’t go to sleep without the lights
But when I got over it I really started noticin'
We only fear a situation when we ain’t controllin' it
I would have seen more scary movies if somebody woulda told a kid
That when you turn the TV off the monsters go away
You know they say there’s nothing to fear, but being afraid
And I’m afraid I never seen the difference being scared made
Except for opportunities to advance going to waste
I never ran so you ain’t got to worry about me giving a chase
I don’t give a fuck
If I’m cornered with a barrel to my face
And niggas claiming that they really ain’t afraid to catch a case
That’s bullshit
Cause a nigga that was ‘bout it would’ve pulled it
And the fear in his eyes say he ain’t go not bullets
Then, once I realize that he ain’t gonna do shit
Be afraid, I got one too dog, and I ain’t afraid to use it
