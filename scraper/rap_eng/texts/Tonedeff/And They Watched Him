A poor boy, just 5 years old
Enchanted with the noise that chimed in his soul
He lined up every goal, as a child he was certain
And everyone that he told, asked him not to disturb them

And they watched him - and they laughed
And they watched him - and they laughed
And they watched him - and they laughed
And they watched him - and they laughed

As he grew, he would prove that he had it
And man nobody knew how he was doing this magic
From music to graphics, to movement and acting
He made it to the television screen and he smashed it

[x4]
And they watched him — and they clapped

But he withdrew from the lure of the rap shit
Because he couldn’t do what the suits would be asking
He told then all the news, he would choose to be absent
And everyone he knew, was confused by his actions

[x4]
And they watched him - and they gasped

He moved to the big city of dreams
The very thing he swore he wouldn’t do as a teen
He generated news and the views was obscene
But his heritage and speed was hard to market, it seemed

[x4]
And they watched him - and they passed

Out of frustration, he would launch his scheme
Began to cross the nation as the boss of his team
And people mocked his validation, cause of online streams
And told him that he was soft because they watched him sing

[x4]
And they watched him - and they mad

And his big day came and it went
Cause every dollar spent, went from promo to rent
And since familiarity would always breed contempt
They would leave him - when he couldn't meet the needs of his friends

[x4]
And they watched him - and they ran

Now people act like he doesn't exist
And every first he ever hit has been bumped from the list
And they run with his shit, spitting it quick minus his wit
The every-man online turning their sung parts up in the mix

[x4]
And he watched them, and he laughed

I'm independent
I'm alternative
I'm an artist
