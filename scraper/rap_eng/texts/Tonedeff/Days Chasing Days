[Chords]
Man I see days chasing days, everything stays the same
No more night and day, everything is grey papier-maché
Same song on the radio by the same old artist
Same assholes on CNN giving the same "no comments"
Same he say, she say shit
Grab any given weekday and just put it on replay
Ring, ring, rise and shine time to lie
On the couch and watch TV 'til your eyes go blind
Watch the guy in the Gucci suit talk about tryin' times
And the guy that sold you the gun turn around fighting crime
Days chasin' days, people make mistakes
And don't think solution, they look for somewhere to place the blame

[Tonedeff]
It's Just Days Chasing Days - Everything stays the same
Enemy's names will change, but their deeds remain in place
What are these arranged mistakes, but a link in the chains of fate
With the singular basic aim to deplete us of age and strength
You can flee or embrace this replay of the Deja scene in The Matrix
But keeping beneath the blankets won't stave off seeing the day shift
So, instead of being evasive, I portray 'brave' and I face it
As I watch in amazement, as these paid pricks do this lame shit
And then trade shifts on the same staged hit, 'bout fame & dollars
Niggas ain't biting no more, they're just claiming they're paying homage
I'm saying, God must be the illest producer
He fills us with youth, but trims us out before we can hear where the sample loops up

[Chorus 2x]
Sometimes it makes me wanna say "oh lord"
Sometimes it makes me wanna shout "oh lord"
Sometimes it makes me wanna scream "oh lord"
I'm sick and tired of these days chasin' days

[Tonedeff]
Yo, Chords, man. I really hope these days'll catch up again
Till then, I'll gnash up the back of my pen, cause it acts as my last defense
Of my head against these sad and tragic events
That happen when history's repeating itself, eating itself for the lack of an end
And I'm tackling trends – It's all misleading
Just gimme 2 pair of my Adidas and we'll call it even
See, I'm not a mad rapper, I'm just frustrated
To see ya profiting with something you ripped off and barely bothered to update it!
So, fuck waiting another 10 years, till these twerps say
That what I was doing a decade ago is the reason they rhyme in the first place
Hah! So in a worst-case scenario, I work with a smirked face
And pervert breaks and assertively rape your stereo

[Chords]
I see days chasin' days, everything stays the same
I've seen Jesus become the patron saint of a paper chase
I've seen wars justified by one verse of Amazing Grace
I've been face to face with the devil in the most sacred place
I've seen utopia for what it is; a pipe dream
I've seen murderous minds scheme turnin' the world to a crime scene
Learnt that whether winter, spring, summer or fall
Empires will plummet and fall to the ground and crumble apart
So is it me or these Venetian blinds
That keep my mind laggin' like a week behind
Cause all this darkness is treatin' me like razorblades
And it's no light all I see are days chasin' days

[Chorus]
Sometimes it makes me wanna say "oh lord"
Sometimes it makes me wanna shout "oh lord"
Sometimes it makes me wanna scream "oh lord"
I'm sick and tired of these days chasin' days
