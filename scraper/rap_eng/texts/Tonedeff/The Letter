[Verse 1: Session]
Yo, wassup baby, I thought maybe
I write you this, I know I haven't shown you love lately
So, I'm playin' my part, way from the start
You somethin' like my blood how you stay in my heart
My love - you know I'm sinkin' without you
I spend every single second thinkin' about you
The way you move, the way you groove
The way you soothe, I'm so into you
Got me in the clouds I love bein' around
I'll climb the highest mountain and scream it out loud
Everyday I can't help but bein' aroused
And you never gave up on your dreams and I'm proud
So fly, there ain't nothin' you can't do
Don't ever sweat whoever never came through
They ain't you but I see ya vision
I'd wait my whole life if you went to prison
There isn't a soul more devoted to you
I write it all down so you could quote it as true
Get it noterized, it all came from within
Use the same ink, tattoo ya name on my skin
By far you're number one in my life
‘Fore my friends, ‘fore my ends, ‘fore my end
You want a Benz, nice things, I come through
I'll do my best to give the world to you

[Hook: Tonedeff]
There's nowhere that your love won't take me
Just put your faith in me, my love
If you can face me, oh my love
You'll never hate me, no my love
And if I'm dreamin' please don't wake me
You better let me sleep, my love
You get the best in me, my love
You'll be the death of me, my love

[Verse 2: Session]
You far from average, you are the baddest person
Perfect, you come with no baggage
A marriage of mind, body, soul, and flow
And you body anybody I know fa sho
I'll buy you all the nicest things, ice ya ring
Ya last name sounds nice to Singh
No matter the price it brings, worth the stacks
We identical twins, a perfect match
Because of me you ain't a virgin no mo'
Because of you I ain't a virgin no mo' and so
We share somethin' real personal ya know
What I got nobody deserves to know fa sho
And yo, I'm sorry that I'm always on tour
I give my life up so that you can live yours
Love, you know that you got it like that
I know what's in your heart, you ain't gotta write back

Love
