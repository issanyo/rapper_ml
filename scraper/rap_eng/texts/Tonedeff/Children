[Intro X4 - Anetra]
Why don’t you fly on by
If your flock dives you’ll die

[Hook X2 - Anetra]
You can get up under the wind and glide away
The sky is big enough for everybody
You don’t have to live life the normal way
Just glide your own way

[Verse 1]
One day you’ll look back at your life and wonder, like “what the fuck was I thinking”
Puffing and drinking at seven – public delinquent
Setting yourself up for nothing, just loving life, cussing & beefing
Without knowing what to believe in
Or even care for that matter, cause you’re too young to be hunting for reason
When school days are your function of meeting
And looking back on the days when the term ‘back in the days’ wasn’t existent
You wonder if who you were is who you are this instant
Cause when you’re 10 you’re not far from an infant
Or when prom could be listed down as your longest commitment
Shit, time has a wicked sense of humor that’s harshly sadistic
It puts what you did wrong, in the distance by foggin your senses
I harbor resentment for bandwagons, and tailgators
Braggart cats who ain’t graduate with a penchant for brand-fashion
Little miss know it all bitches, and Bully-Ass bastards with bad manners
So, if you can’t stand it, let’s demand action

[Hook X2]

[Verse 2]
You see – hindsight is 20/20 as motherfucker
Some people never learn from others, cause they love to suffer
I’m being real with y’all, I seldom bunch my tongue up
Yet, to this day, I never had the balls to say ‘fuck’ in front my mother
I’ve come to realize the world changes with every summer
Sundown to sun up, the seasons run out asunder
I’ve seen the power of drugs, of greed and the violence of guns
And the people somehow get numb, as evil devours the young
With a feeble amount of love instilled in em
Meanwhile even teachers don’t wanna build with ‘em
But I realized that I can still hit em, and see inside where the chill bit em
With heat provided by a lil rhythm
I seek to guide whoever’s grippin for wisdom, I’ll do what I can
Cause I wished I received a bit a this, but I was doomed to withstand
The unscrupulous manner In which I learned, with ruthless abandon
Now, due to demand… children behold the truth is at hand
See, them cats you hanging with now, is who you are
And they’ll become their parents, so look at them and decide if that’s who you wanna be
Honestly, think about their qualities
You’re probably exhibiting parts of these people’s behaviors chronically
Call me a saint to warn ya – see that bitch that thinks she’s the shit
At 15 with the heaving tits, the type kids would just fiend to get
Will end up pregnant before she hits community college, broke and soon to be jobless
Abused by the dude she gets high with
See, little girls believe every love is true and it’s timeless
Till they get fucked by ‘Mr. Cool’ and guess who ends up crying
But guys ain’t no stranger to the forces of nature
We’re only out for pussy, that’s why we split with no good reason to break up
Now, Mr. Popularity… is just that
In 10 years, he’ll be Mr. Popularity with a bad job and a mustasche
So, fuck that socialite bullshit that they force upon you
Believe me, this is the exact course I’ve gone through

[Hook X2]

[Bridge]
Fly your own way – Do your own thing
Fuck what they say – Follow your own swing
Use your mind now – Don’t get swept up
Use your time well – Don’t get kept up
Live your own life – Get your taste right
Find your own vibe – Fuck what they like
Don’t get caught up – Live in your own skin

[Verse 3]
See, most motherfuckers are sheep, it was true then and it still is
Take away the uniforms, y’all will dress the same way to fit in
Nowadays I see ya… doing whatever you see on TV
Media Brainwashed, buying a new trend every 3 weeks
And you’re knee deep in cheap weed, liquor… there’s even STD’s in pre-teens
It’s different now… So, fuck whatever we think
Right? Well, ya might be. Things have only changed ever so slightly
Like… Same Jordans minus the swoosh from Nike
I see it’s worse than ever. There’s no respect and no thirst to endeavor
Just kids that want to be first in the center
With no work ethic – to earn their own personal shelter
Bursting with pent up aggression, these are the things you observe as an elder
Cause when you grow it hurts to stay inside your shell
I’ll prolly rewrite this song in 20 years, and dedicate it to myself
I guess the jist of it is, that when you’re big, you’ll just miss how you lived
And when you’re a kid, you’ll just wish you were big
So for now

[Hook X2]
