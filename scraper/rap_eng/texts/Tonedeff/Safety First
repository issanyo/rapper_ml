[Chorus]
Slow ya roll, partner! Just hold your horses
‘For you go starting mess, know your role, bitch
Tonedeff’s, your papa! Sesh owns y’all whole shit
Remember that you may get hurt. Safety first
Slow ya roll, partner! Just hold your horses
‘For you go starting mess, know your role, bitch
Tonedeff’s, your papa! Sesh owns y’all whole shit
Remember that you may get hurt. Safety first

[Verse 1A: Tonedeff]
When I start to strike with thoughts that you ain’t have the heart to write
The following scars are sponsored by Spicasso & The Archetype
Your squad is not as nice as ours is, we amount to twice the artists
Y’all just get discounted as often as prices down at Target
I ain’t have to split profits to get a bid on the market
I just spit for the art and word caught on quicker than SARS did
Start picking your coffin; Your chick keeps a dick in her pocket
And commands that you remove your shoes before licking the carpet

[Verse 1B: Session]
It’s Session, Spicasso I walk on the third rail
Spark till I turn pale wit narcs on the herb trail
You only served jail for ya failed crimes
My dick is one mile, I use it for a sundial, it’s how I tell time
Stale rhymes like yours don't deserve to be quoted
With a flow you can not see like someone in Germany wrote it
Till then to home ya limpin', shoot hands out
Make ya lip stand out like you’re Homer Simpson

[Chorus]
Slow ya roll, partner! Just hold your horses
‘For you go starting mess, know your role, bitch
Tonedeff’s, your papa! Sesh owns y’all whole shit
Remember that you may get hurt. Safety first
Slow ya roll, partner! Just hold your horses
‘For you go starting mess, know your role, bitch
Tonedeff’s, your papa! Sesh owns y’all whole shit
Remember that you may get hurt. Safety first

[Verse 2A: Session]
Tonedeff, create grooves, everyday heat
Break dudes when we play beats, and make moves like NBA Street
QN5, you can't outbuy us, man don't try us
We pan out fires, so just hand out flyers
BITCH! you wack, even ya beats suckin' bad
I’ll tell you who the illest producer is, my fuckin' dad!
Puffin bags, still got stamina for slammin' ya
You say you was up north? Then you must’ve meant Canada

[Verse 2B: Tonedeff]
It’s Bananas, eh? Tonedeff & Session
Are so fresh in essence, we both lent our scents to fill up cans of spray
Endorsements through Bowflex and Mennen, You’re whole set’s fe-minine
You throw fits like women. Push Kotex and bins of Vaginaid
Go fetch an entrance for your next profession, in a coat check
Or dressing room – Don’t mess with testing mics or think of flippin’ a beat
If you ever get bigger than me, It isn’t a bitter defeat
But did you get your receipt? Cause now, ‘pay your dues’ is more than a figure of speech!

[Chorus]
Slow ya roll, partner! Just hold your horses
‘For you go starting mess, know your role, bitch
Tonedeff’s, your papa! Sesh owns y’all whole shit
Remember that you may get hurt. Safety first
Slow ya roll, partner! Just hold your horses
‘For you go starting mess, know your role, bitch
Tonedeff’s, your papa! Sesh owns y’all whole shit
Remember that you may get hurt. Safety first

[Verse 3A: Tonedeff]
I’m a veritable monstrosity! Flip incomparable-parable bombs, constantly
Possibly perennial, plenty of flow ferocity
Vocal velocity, against any posse accosting me
Not to be sonically swapped with quality atrocities
Bitches are gossipy, Niggas exhibit hypocrisy
Talkin’ seedy behind my back but give props to me optically
Verses are sloppily constructed, incompetent carpentry
Sucked at monopoly – I switched cards to charge you a doctor’s fee
Stopping the monotony is the prophecy I shot at the industry novelties
And punks that don’t put their heart in the artistry
It’s hard to see our cultural freedom philosophies
Get tossed to sea, for the cars you need, pretty sluts and the cost of weed
As I rhyme, I see the scars recede, whenever they start to bleed
Pressure’s promptly applied to the beat’s properties properly
Proud of my sovereignty, cause I’m baggin' shit like colostomies
If I gotta spell it out, you’d best to double the F and cross the T

[Verse 3B: Session]
The mic abuser, makin' seven holes wit six shooters
And make it seem like you dove face first into a juicer
Before I think I close my eyes and access my computer
Type the password and login Session as the user
You loser, but I never sleep, I realize there's
Always challengers, so my eyes stay open like I died scared
We ride here, NY, you rep were you are not from
Get dropped son, body stretched out like a dachshund
I got some cash and hash man, pass grams
And I can't be got, I'm E. Honda with the fast hands
Knuckles crash land, make ya nose runny
And make ya side split like I said somethin' funny
Sonny, how that sound? I'm that down
We could box, but you’ll get beat half an hour before the last round
Quick fast down, trash clown
You couldn't put up ya dukes if our gloves were half pounds

[Chorus]
Slow ya roll, partner! Just hold your horses
‘For you go starting mess, know your role, bitch
Tonedeff’s, your papa! Sesh owns y’all whole shit
Remember that you may get hurt. Safety first
Slow ya roll, partner! Just hold your horses
‘For you go starting mess, know your role, bitch
Tonedeff’s, your papa! Sesh owns y’all whole shit
Remember that you may get hurt. Safety first
