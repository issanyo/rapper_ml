Chorus: Get 'Em Up, Now, Gentleman, Wet 'Em Up
Hit Em Up, Now Everyone - Move In
Get 'Em Up, Now, Gentleman, Wet 'Em Up
Hit Em Up, Now Everyone - Ride Out

[V1]
Yo, I hit em up with a bit of a touch
Of atypical lyrical visual cinema
When I set up in the thick of the rhythm I get em intox-I-cated
Its not complicated I made this one of a kind
Run of a rhyme, to stun or to blind, fly women from the front or behind
If they stuck in the line, its something to find
I ain't stubborn to spend, but this one brother been, hunting for dimes
I pluck em in time, the second I get a chance to
Hittin the backroom, in the mid of the song we dance through
Bashful? Never That/ High Maintenance? Send her Back
This track for the broke as fuck cats that's with the better raps
Seven women stacked in our laps
Figured that we were prized with Kentucky Fried Chicken Dinner Packs
Is it a fact? Oh yes indeed
T successfully brings the best recipe

[V2]
Yo, we gonna play Rawhide all-night
I'm bringing the broad pipe just to get your walls tight
Never see it coming with your foresight
Loving to leave ya' quadriplegic like a fall from 4 flights
I'm more like the type to charm t he hell outta ya
Why do ya' wanna assume I play you like a harmonica
On to the next order of business
Attraction happens in a fabulous simultaneous instant
Niggas know what blabbin about
The second your mind reaches a dime piece, you be thinking of askin her out
With the last of bit of doubt
Taking the drivers position, never settle for the passenger route
With an ass that's outlandish T-o-n-e can't stand it
This woman even got me speak span-glish
Baby Tu Eres Sexy! Forget It
She wasn't feeling the charge like it was bad credit anesthetic
No time for feeling pathetic
When at the spot that's so hot, the liquor be getting tepid
I'm sick of getting rejected already this evening
My team's steaming cause I'm already fiending to be leaving
Even now, that I be breathing loud
I wasn't peeping how there was girl reaching out
To take my hand, But when I turned Fate Commanded
I'm left stranded - (Cock-Block) -
I HATE THE MAN!

[V3]
But wait there's more, add the asterisk
I ain't leaving the club until I got an ass to hit
My plans for smashing get tarnished
Cause there's nobody left in this piece to get it started
And I don't flip for the typical harlot
I'm finicky, never beggin your pardon
Knowing I'm sprung whenever a certain part of my anatomy hardens
I'm honest... dickin a chicken
With an Elektra-magnetic figure a la Carmen goodness, gracious
Tonedeff as nice as skies are spacious
Vivacious...Knock a Hotty liable to fry some ice glaciers
Rock hard bodies attached to nice faces
Bras of high weight, or tall with tight waists
Or Thongs that vibrate in all the right places
Never hit up the bar for my tastes
If you're less shy wasted than buy 9 cases
Time is wasting I'm chasing the scattered ass
Contemplating my chance of a latter pass
At the honey that was taken from me, snatched from my grasp
That's it! I'm about to tackle the task
So, I dash in the path of her man with a laugh
Just to act natural plus she was mad bashful
My rap flow canceled her plans, left her man surpassed
Then I took her to tantra class, uh
