[Verse 1: Substantial]
Tired of nine to fives in my case two to tens
Refuse to choose methods that others use to win
If my talent ain’t involved. Working got my head hurting
To the point you couldn’t fix it with a quart of Tylenol
No stranger to labor. On the whole, it’s pointless
If in the end I haven’t been working toward my goals
So I stay hunting for green like Lex Luthor
So I can dead any beef I might have in the future with my super
Man rent’s due! We’re on our last roll of toilet tissue
Plus queen and I be having issues when doe’s tight
Suddenly I’m less concerned with getting my flow right
Restless barely caught a wink through the whole night
Running on fumes could blackout in an instant
On “E” with barely enough to finish this very sent…
Tense muscles! Sometime I wonder
Did blacks invent struggle ‘cause we know it well
Rich in many things but I’m still broke as hell
And what’s red and black without some greenbacks
A fund less revolution is money the solution
More money more problem more bills less truth
More lies less you mobilize lets move
And get that cheese for cats get me
But I’m clever as Jerry so never you worry
I’ll provide for fam long after I’m buried

[Hook: Substantial]
3 Months past benefits kick in
6 months past and I feel like quitting
Promotion after 9 a whole new beginning
Made insane by these labor pains
3 Months past benefits kick in
6 months past and I feel like quitting
Promotion after 9 a whole new beginning
Made insane by these labor pains

[Verse 2: Substantial]
It’s like morning sickness when I wake up for work filled with ill will
Wanting to murder my boss like Kill Bill
The real feel what I’m saying ‘cause it’s realer talk
Wishing I was still a little kid watching Silver Hawks
Now that’s a distant memory now my days are spent
At the bar during happy hour sipping hennesy
Like it’s a remedy for these growing pains
So insane but I hope for change
Like homeless pan-handlers yall’d rather ignore me
‘Cause hearing this song is like listening to your story
It would be nice to retire at forty
But my mom hasn’t and she’s over age sixty
Probably do better if she wasn’t plagued with me
But they say babies are a gift from God
But they feel like a burden when shit gets hard
Over due utilities I’m knowing you is feeling me
These hard times are meant to be something you learn from
So hard work essentially is something you should earn from
Money don’t grow on trees but it leaves
And even harder to get for underground MC’s
It’s enough to make you hate breathing
Working two or three jobs just to break even
Labor pains is the reason why I ain’t sleeping
Fuck sloppy seconds! Why can’t my people eat like they eating
Even when we ain’t eating we always cooking
Like Ope be telling me I’m hoping felonies
Ain’t in my forecast because lack of my own
Got me looking at your cash but I earn my shit
And try to save something never burn my shit
So we can cop homes a Brooklyn brownstone
And maybe I’ll own land back in MD
For whenever we need to escape the big city
So let’s get busy and start our business
We’ll succeed if our hearts are in it
I’ll work for me and not for another
To provide jobs for all of our brothers and queens ya’nahmeen
