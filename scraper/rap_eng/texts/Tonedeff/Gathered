Nothing really seems to matter
When you’ve gone this far
Got all my belongings gathered
Got my best shoes on

Walking on the line
Hope you’re there with me
Following behind
Watching intently

What you gonna do when no one’s
There to hear your song
And if so, how long until you
Think you should move on

Walking on the line
No one there to catch me
Curious and blind
Fear of what I can’t see

So don’t, don’t say you want it
When you know you don’t need it
How hard is it to say what’s on your mind
Don’t say you want it
When you know you don’t need the weight to make it to the other side
But are you brave enough to try

Sometimes we think we can fly, with our wings tattered
Sometimes we don’t think to try, cause we don’t know any better
So, I’ve gathered myself just to prove
To me that I’m not afraid anymore – I am not afraid anymore
Of what’s around the corner
I am not afraid anymore

Nothing really seems to matter
When you’ve gone this far
Got all my belongings gathered
Got my game face on

Walking on the line
I know you’re here with me
Following behind
Watching intently

So don’t, don’t say you want it
When you know you don’t need it
How hard is it to say what’s on your mind
Don’t say you want it
When you know you don’t need the weight to make it to the other side
But are you brave enough to try

Sometimes we think we can fly, with our wings tattered
Sometimes we don’t think to try, cause we don’t know any better
So, I’ve gathered myself just to prove
To me that I’m not afraid anymore
Sometimes, we blink at the moon like we didn’t see it coming
Sometimes we jump in too soon, from the fear of running
Just when you think that there is nothing in the world
To see – Just know there is something around the corner
You know there’s something around the corner. (Hey)
You know, there’s something around the corner
But you don’t have to be afraid anymore
