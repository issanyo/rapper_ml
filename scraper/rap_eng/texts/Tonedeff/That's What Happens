Tonedeff
I’m not a millionaire, but kid, I got a million ways to rhyme
With the skill that’s paired with wit atop a villain’s frame of mind
Like a military hit upon civilian stations
I’m equipped to kill unfairly, shit you poppin really ain’t advised
If you’re willing to pay the price, I’ll hold account
Life’s a revolving door, cause money, If I’m going in, you going out
Funny, since I hold the clip – you owe me now
Dummies dip, like “Holy Shit! That fucker Tone’s just as quick when you slow him down!”
Most ridiculous show in town! Hold no interest in yours cause now
Headliners don’t perform, they just sync their lips and support the crowd
So I’m infamous, world renowned for my gifts when I’m beastin
But, Jesus, when I leave people speechless – how will I get word of mouth?
I’m a mixture of Roman power, Olympian breathing
The flow is twisted. Your seasick with motion-sickness aboard the ground
The known risk isn’t worth your drowning. Don’t slip!
Supreme with my Sotomayor-Steeze, it’s the token spic on the court with power
Hold witnesses sworn-in, vowing to rat on you cats
Cause once the gavel’s tapped then that’s a wrap, ho – pick if it’s corn or flower
When we bid to get into this, plenty pricks in New York were sour
Now business is infinite – ain’t no clique that gets more than ours
The mission is simple: Just deliver hits to these hoards of followers
Visit with tours and bond with ‘em, Hip ‘em to corporate prowlers
Now THIS is a movement, not that bullshit that you force through bowels
Resistance to QN5? Start enlisting your mourners now, you cowards!
Ha!

(Hook)
People wanna talk if they don’t think you looking now
You can put em up, kid, if you wanna put me down
Say it to my face… or stay up in your place, just
Say it to my face… or stay up in your place, Trick

You can never duplicate the way we made our name
Cause ain’t no fuckin rules if we refuse to play the game
Say it to my face… or stay up in your place, just
Say it to my face… or stay up in your place, Trick
Na-na-na-na-nah

PackFM
Clap at your tee-pee like the passenger seat piece
You don’t have to believe me, living like I’m trapped in a tv
See, rapping is easy, I mastered the art of massacre
Feed me beats that’s harder than the task of finding an Asterisk CD
Now ask us if we be, the last of a breed
Internationally known to hold the throne
And prone to smash it to pieces
Til wee bits of glass leave scratches on wax
Now take that wax off motherfucker, like grasshoppers teacher
Now as for a feature, I do this for cash only, pass on a free-be
You need me for exposure, but I’m closing the latch on you leeches
And raggedy creatures who don’t practice your preachin
Rollin with vag is as bad as bringin sand to the beaches
Now last but not least this immaculate thesis
Will rapidly reach the masses and capacity peeks just as fast as they leak it
You asked for it people, there can’t be no equal
This track is the prequel to “Ruthless”
Now watch how I ruin the raps in your leaflet
Let’s Do This!

(Hook)
People wanna talk if they don’t think you looking now
You can put em up, kid, if you wanna put me down
Say it to my face… or stay up in your place, just
Say it to my face… or stay up in your place, Trick

You can never duplicate the way we made our name
Cause ain’t no fuckin rules if we refuse to play the game
Say it to my face… or stay up in your place, just
Say it to my face… or stay up in your place, Trick
Na-na-na-na-nah

Cue the claps, Algorythm attacks
To set the Tone, now we five steps ahead of the Pack
And it’s a wrap!
That’s what happens, man
That’s what happens, man
That’s what happens, man
That’s what happens, man

2DopeBoyz with the bass in the back
The Meka-nized breaks make ya Shake in your tracks
And it’s a wrap!
That’s what happens, man
That’s what happens, man
That’s what happens, man
That’s what happens, man
