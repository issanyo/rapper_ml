They’re touches that you never feel
Cuts that happen in the heat of your fight

You’re just the last to know it’s real
And though you can’t recall, they sting in your side

Something’s coming. Just beyond your feelers

They’re warnings that you never hear
Till the glass explodes - it’s seen with your eyes

Forever captive of your fears
Your distraction holds your ransom so high

There’s no signs, no rhyme, no reason, why and how, right now
Once you know it’s over - you’re the last to find out

These are the things you don’t see coming
Tie the blindfold tight
These are the words of another victim
Standing still as they’re killed by the whiplash
