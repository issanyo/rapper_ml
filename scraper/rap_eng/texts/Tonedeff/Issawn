[Verse 1: Tonedeff]
Slack fucks, back it up, Act rough, smash cups
Crack thumbs Catch a lump, The mad rush anthem
Jab Guts, Slap Cuffs on hands of strapped thugs
Flap Gums, Tap their Mug, Catch slugs? Bad luck
Clap guns? I’ve had enough, Stack ones? Pass the buck
Amped, Son? Examine the last punk who’s trap’s shut
Wack chumps, & fags duck, in the back of a packed club
We stand front, snatch em, and vanish once the cab comes
Fast Love? Shag sluts, ass hump, stab muffs
Women grab studs, show em upper class Tantra
Now Dance dumb, have fun, I’ll rap till I collapse lungs
Chickens flash jugs if you wanna have your man sprung
Dash, crush in the fashion of Mack trucks, that’s crunk
Leave your hat spun, bash drums, after the band’s done
You’re trapped, stuck, throw a mass tantrum! You can’t front
We bout to light it up, tell em where you snagged the match from

[Hook: Tonedeff]
Lets get set with this, freshness
Restless Kids, Just step to this!
Yes, It’s on!
This excuse to just wreck shit
Flex Chicks! Cause we ain’t sexist!
Yes, It’s on!
Press up next to this entrance
Hence, don’t jet for those exits
Yes, It’s on!
Vexed? Upset? With your section?
Then, don’t stress! Release Tension!
Yes, It’s on!

[Verse 2: Tonedeff]
Monsterous, stompin shit, without the risk of consequence
Watch it kid, outta respect, learn how to use your common sense
Rockin it, shock your system out with this atomic kick
Ominous, sound that picks you up to put you down again
Dominant, confident, troopin, on without a hitch
The QN Slaughterhouse 5 like Kurt Vonnegut
Ironic, is it not a bit? You cocky pricks, wanna bitch?
You must’ve lost your noodles like you dropped a pasta dish
Preposterous! Shout at kids, blockin ‘em with a hockey stick
Your fosse click, gets sent back to the dot com, with lots of hits
It’s obvious, geologists with documents, have proven that we’re toppling
The continents by the amount we’re hopping and
We’re proud of it! I’ll Allow the crowd to vent
Hip-Hop to politics! No matter what the topic is, we’re squashing it!
The clock is set! Tick-tick-tock It’s about to get
Brolic, yet, we always got ya gawkin in astonishment!

Break:
Tear this bitch down right now

[Verse:3 Tonedeff]
I got the lethal lingo – with a street flow, to keep more
People eagerly breathing, fiending for the repeat dose
But there be no sequel, or cheap clone of the team known
As Deac, Kno, Elite, Tone and beats grown by Domingo
From the East Coast to Reno, We swing bows and Meet hoes
With freak jones, and leaves holes so they’re wide enough for free throws
Now, Reach throats, squeeze hold, but freeze though, police hope
You do something illegal – like deal coke – you seen blow?
Like Deep snow, we shut em down – Peaceful
Bring your pea coats, if you thinking to drink more, with the chug of a steamboat
Wanna beef, yo? You bleed, so, don’t leave home with clean clothes
We “Plink!” Bones, like fink Joe Pesci’s role in Casino
My speech holds diesel! Heats coal, Please don’t
Sleep, or your bound to wake up screaming with your sheets soaked
Fuck a c-note, this here’s free show
Cause tonight, we’re all millionaires, like the ATM machines broke!
