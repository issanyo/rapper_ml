Time present and time past are both perhaps present in time future; hence times future contains in time past
If all time is etherly present, all time is unredemable
More say that the end precedes the beginning, and the end and the beginning were always there
Before the beginning and after the end, and all is always now
Words move, music moves, only in time, but that which is only living can only die

Time is long gone
Come on
You know you can't rely on me
No
And I won't ask you again
No
And I won't ask you again
No
And I won't ask you again

Words after speech reach into the silence
