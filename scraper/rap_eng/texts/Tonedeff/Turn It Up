[Verse 1: Tonedeff]
See, now I’d bet a fuckin' G, you prolly thinkin’, now, who the fuck is this misfit
Proving something on this mix, Dude this must be a misprint
True, I'm bumpin' this list, trick, move, I’m snuffing these bitch kids
Y’all niggas is bout as sweet as the nugget stuffed in them twix sticks
It’s Tonedeff, the nigga that cuts through these suckas with swift lips
Clueless fuckers get wigs split, Rumors come but they’re dismissed
Fooling us with a quick switch? Tuned to some other mix disc
Would be like finding Nas with the Blueprint bumping in his whip
Fools get dumped in a ditch, just rudely fronting like big fist
Now, print this, The Plague, bitch, crews don’t want it with this clique
You was hunting for tidbits, then you found the Archetype and
K-Slay, the playa with the most exclusive cuts in the business My shit is a little bit more than the human tongue can omit
Hit floosies up where their slits drip, do this under their clit lids
Columbian & Cuban blood under this skin
Who can touch the description of a psuedo-super-pun with a slim trim
I’m – the new and improved functioning whiz with Luger-lungs
And the fitness to the deliver the most brutal bumps to these dim wits
I’m driven as if I threw a clutch in the stick shift
One listen’ll strip 30 years from your life, shit, music this comes with a pension
Intensive, administration of a million tooth-puncturing pin-pricks
From all of your minions to the bastard who fronts your equipment
Disaster soon comes in a instant
To pussy virtual tools, like Lara Croft with a two guns tucked in her middrift
Dig this busted youth becoming so twisted
Kids’ll request Smilez & Southstar more than the true 100% shit
QN5 is the governing imprint
That’s bludgeoning opposition with the indifference of a grandmother who would smother an infant
I’ll leave you stunned as I come to admit this
Yo, son, nah, really… you’re nice… and J. Lo’s pussy’s a wonderful Christian
I’m adjusting my lenses… niggas really looked thug from a distance
But the minute you come close, you see the slump in their limp wrist
And I’m plugging your chick, dig? it’s nothing tremendous
See… I loan her the cock, and you’re stuck with the interest
Her lust won’t allow her to front or resist this
Stiff dick that so big, that Tonedeff get counted as a couple in the census
Punch with a clenched fist, rupturing defenses, till your only fear is survival
I will spit scriptures that embarrass the bible
Go ahead, spit, You’re still wearing the title? Then back it’s back to your place
I’ll say you’re wack to your face, faster than Simon from American Idol

[Chorus]
