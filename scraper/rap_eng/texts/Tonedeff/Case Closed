Let's get a bit acquainted
Hey, it's t-o-n-e-d-e-double-the-eff, with the famous flow
Known to be flipping syllables even when the pace is slow
Gracious, No! Save your soul, guess who is coming to take this throne
Break this whole motherfucking game down, and reclaim crowns
Cause I'm sick of layin' down
Watching these companies reign now
When it's obvious something is playin' out
On the stage while you're unconscious they shoving to gain ground
And sedate crowds with the same sound
They've been layin up into your brain loud
Enough to take any rational thought
And leave your brain clouded to rap as just pop
Isn't it insane how - niggas be keeping their face frowned
Perpetrating their need to erase clowns
They remain proud, till the minute you see them in lace gowns
All the sudden, they flee to escape town
They're ashamed cause they got busted
Just because of that, and not really
Because they regret what they've done, is disgusting
This discussion's meant to function as a general centerpiece
Sent at these enemies bent on resenting me
Better be set if we enter the end of peace
Settling isn't an option no more
We gon' box in this war
You'll be hearing them bells before we knock on your door, it goes:

Buckle up! Brace yourself! Knuckle up! Take no l's
Dust to dust! Say farewell! Numbers up! Save yourself!
Buckle up tight! We're gonna tussle! We gonna fight!
Until you never touch another mic, or it's your life, then - case closed

This is the way, we ever gonna see that it stops
And if not, you might as well give up on hip-hop
Cause this is the case, in this day and age
We gotta kick in your face if you're just in for fame

Now that you been initiated up into this movement
Get at your favorite idiot who's spits
Hit him a little bit with your 2 fists
Kick in his grill until he is toothless
Give him a min to get up and cue this
Single out eve-ry limb that's wounded
Whip him again with a heavy pool stick
Dig on his bitch, and then beg he do shit
Ruthless roots of abuse set loose for execution
Of any groups that get us confused
With petty fools who'll let you crew win
Check the movements
Fluent as I ever was, I said it! Because-
You would never think that a nigga that never drink
Would ever step it up to get a better buzz
On the regular - the odds you've leapt ahead of us
Are prolly less, than Oedipus hating his mother
Or Disney hiring sexual predators
Senators getting elected a 3rd consecutive term
A nurse who doesn't do enemas
Permanent henna
A surfer that catches more waves then your current antennae does
Sure,I make it look effortless
With every sentence that tends to be cleverly
Penned,. More wreckless then Session ingesting hennesey blends
More treacherous than even being the Kennedy - Men
And for any requesting the identity of the technically Best MC?
Guess, but,Yep - it's Me
Step to see
The a new strain of the plague
Raised to abuse breaks
Unphased of what you say
Cause I dead lines, all without a due date
I'm the new age. New school. New page. New rules
Any attempt to try to pull away is just a doomed fate for a few fools
QN5, represent the true scene, so we're guaranteed one of two things
Either we're showered with praise
Or we're simply hated by every review team
What I've stated was meant to reduce kings into paupers
And to seduce queens to get topless
And to revolutionize everything you think hip-hop is

Buckle up! Brace yourself! Knuckle up! Take no l's
Dust to dust! Say farewell! Numbers up! Save yourself!
Buckle up tight! We're gonna tussle! We gonna fight!
Until you never touch another mic, or it's your life, then - case closed

Buckle up! Brace yourself! Knuckle up! Take no l's
Dust to dust! Say farewell! Numbers up! Save yourself!
Buckle up tight! We're gonna tussle! We gonna fight!
Until you never touch another mic, or it's your life, then - case closed

This is the way, we ever gonna see that it stops
And if not, you might as well give up on hip-hop
Cause this is the case, in this day and age
We gotta kick in your face if you're just in for fame

This is the way, we ever gonna see that it stops
And if not, you might as well give up on hip-hop
Cause this is the case, in this day and age
We gotta kick in your face if you're just in for fame

(And if you're with me, just)
Bump! (x7)
Case closed
