[Verse 1]
Lust, once ya feel it in your bones, yo, you know you can’t stop it/
Understand? Let me expand while we’re on the topic/
I date plain Janes, hot chicks/
But I usually only fuck with female pilots cause they got the illest cockpits
Ha, and if the crotch fits, wear it/
I’m the type of Martha Fokker to ditch a bitch the day before I meet the parents/
She’s embarrassed she’s dating a rapper – with baggy pants/
Pick her up from mass, system on blast, grabbing her ass/
Glad we could smash, but I gotta move on to the next chick/
I’m an outgoing male, I send one off, and I get one back like Netflix/
Now get this, when you’re sexually reckless, you could have a girl that cooks you breakfast/
But still seek the rejection of some leggy temptress/
She’s like your petty deathwish/
You be dressed in your best shit, tryna silence the skeptics/
Upset kids called her a ho, and I hoped to god it was true/
Cause see, a ho fuck everybody, And a bitch fuck everybody but you/
I’d forget about it, but soon, I behold it’s a sign
Envisioned a coked-out Whitney singing “Moment In Time,” when I told her I rhymed/
And fames the best aphrodisiac known to man, cause now we holding hands/
Saying ‘lets blow this stand’, and I hate to spoil plans/
Now that we rolling, I’m the Trojan man, she’s stroking it fast/
I’m jonesing for ass, but I almost choked on the gas when I opened her pants/
So potent a blast of fish that It was scary, man/
I snatched the pine tree from the rearview mirror then sandwiched it within her hairy clam

[Hook]
This is just another sad song
For times like this, when everything’s mad wrong
You missed your chance, you gotta keep your pants on
When things don’t go your way
Go your way
It’s another assless night
When the shorty your with isn’t acting right
You’re forced to fuck chicks who aren’t half as tight
When things don’t go your way
Go your way

[Verse 2]
I got pussy, pussy, pussy on my mind and it’s killing me/
2 or 3 at a time, menage a trois or a trilogy
I really feel the need to sing this song
Cause I dated a bi-chick for 3 years and I never got my threesome on
There’s only so many tricks that one woman can teach a schlong
And even Cheech & Chong agree, more than one freak sure beats the bong
But, I’ve reached the wall, and yo, I’ve only failed
Knowing that getting the most available hoes with tail to bone & bail’s the holy grail
Now for the solo male there isn’t the fattest chance in hell
You can ask two bad frat chicks to nail without landing your ass in jail
And that’s the real haphazard deal, when one set of tits ain’t enough
Ya’ want wetter clits, save the hunt, Son, you better just pay to fuck
The way my luck is, on whether I’ll get or get got
Is slim, but if the chance comes, I can’t front, I’ll give it a shot
And I’m shitting you not, the day came when I was put to the test
Because of my stage name I met these three hookers looking for sex
They claimed Janessa, Brooke & Beth were their governments
And they wanted to triple the pleasure, triple the fun like they were doublemint
I’m stuttering, I’m looking down at my dick 2 chicks is rubbing it
Beth tells me just to look at her tongue and then imagine my cum on it
Then, suddenly one of ‘em starts crying, some shit bout her ex-man
And when one chicks in need, the two others WILL ditch the sex plan
With staff in hand, I’m asking, “Is it the time for this shit?”
From the back of the pack I hear, “Can’t you keep your mind off your dick?”
Ain' that a bitch?
