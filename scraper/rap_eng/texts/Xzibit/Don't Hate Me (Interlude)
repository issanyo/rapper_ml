[Interlude]
I love you the way you are why is it you hate me
You the right guy for me well, that's what I think
People say I'm crazy that's because of your love
Why, why do you hate me?
When you be with your mates why do you ignore me?
I cry my self to sleep thinking your besides me
Why, why do you hate me?
I've given you all my numbers
And I wait every moment by the phone
But you have no inters in me
You have never phoned me
Why, why do you hate me?
