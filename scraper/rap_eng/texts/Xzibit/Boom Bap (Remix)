[Mixmaster KD (Xzibit) {Diamonique in background}]
{*scratching*}
"Nique-mon-mon-mon" (Turn the track up)
"Nique-mon-mon-mon" (Yeah)
"Nique-mon-mon-mon-mon-dia" (Queen of the west)
"Mon-mon-di-di-di-di-dia" (Beat ya ass to death) {Homeless}

[Diamonique (Xzibit)]
You know the style (Yeah)
You know the name (Oh!)
Chillin' in the top
But it's still the same

[Xzibit]
Yeah
Come on

[Mixmaster KD (Xzibit)]
"Di-di-di-di-Diamonique" (Diamonique)

[Verse 1: Diamonique]
Boogle in the dance
Boogle in the dance
Boogle in the, boogle in the, boogle in the party
This Diamonique here to wake up everybody
With an instant classic like this was "Lodi Dodi"
No west coast slang, you better ask somebody
She's a hottie with a body mixed with Bonnie and the shotty
I could whip you with a battle verse or make you move your body
Whether if I'm feeling hostile or if I'm feeling naughty
Naughty By Nature, they love to hate ya
Hate to have to get your body braced up
I'm ready for war, got the Air Force laced up
Back up, rude boy, get ya face maced up
I fuck your face up, now turn the bass up
Tear down the club, fuck the whole place up
Sweat out your clothes, run the hoe's make up
Fall the windows, DJ's, turn the bass up

Chorus:
[Diamonique]   You know the style
You know the name
Chillin' in the top
But it's still the same
West coast is back, taking over the game
[Mixmaster KD] "Di-Diamonique"
"Nique-mon-dia"
[Diamonique]   You know the style
You know the name
Chillin' in the top
But it's still the same
West coast is back, taking over the game

[Xzibit]       You know who
[Mixmaster KD] "X-X-X-zi-zi-zibit"

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
To all my niggas drinking Pruno, gettin' bent in prison
Watching the game, they can't stop us from livin'
I was givin' a direction, but I never took it
The path was crooked in crack, so I learned to cook it
It's the Blackfort Geronimo Prat
The world on his back
Animal instinct
Adjust to my habitat
Any situation react
You get
Manhandled and slapped down, man not fucking around
I think
Big like the heart that rest in my chest
Fuck crunk muh'fuckers that pray for my death
Niggas want me to show love
But ain't none left
Won't speak no names or won't waste my breath
Got too much stamina
Too much energy
Strenght of capabilities to crush my enemies
And that feeling brings me peace and tranquility
Feel the state power sports cars from Italy
Yeah

[Chorus]

[Mixmaster KD]
{*scratching*}
"Di-Diamonique"
"I'm like a diamond when I shine"

Break:
[Diamonique]   Boogle in the dance
Boogle in the dance
Boogle in the, boogle in the, boogle in the party
Boogle in the dance
Boogle in the dance
[Mixmaster KD] "Di-Diamonique"
"I'm like a diamond when I shine"

[Verse 3: Diamonique]
It goes
Boom
Bap
Original rap
Get bitch
Slapped for talking bullcrap
You ain't gangsta, bitch, you ain't never pulled strap
How y'all hate on west coast that rap like that
I ain't
Holding my tongue, got a trap like that
Two G butterfly, cause I'm phat like that
Keep up the hating, get a cap like that
What's worse
They probably slept on the first verse
For the second I wreck it, the second I started rippin'
There's no question to reppin' the I.E. when I'm flippin'
And my suggestion is bump a Diamonique when you dippin'
And my profession is teaching these hatin' bitches to listen
And I ain't stressing the hate from hater shit, I hate this shit
Haters are just mad cause they ain't the shit
I'm the type of destruction, already tastin' it
Ain't no escapin' it, my time is now (Let's go)

[Chorus]

[Mixmaster KD]
{*scratching*}
"I'm like a diamond when I shine"

[Diamonique]   Whoo!
Mixmaster KD
[Fingazz]      {*scratching*}
"Fingazz on the track..."
[Diamonique]   Streetlight
[Xzibit]       Come on
