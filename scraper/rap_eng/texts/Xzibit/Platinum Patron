[Verse 1: Xzibit]
Blacker than black tar
I keep on coming back, I'll beat that pussy down
I'll make you walk the track
Hey ma, look at me now, like I've done robbed a bank
Like a Jamaican making dollars, Puff and Shabba Ranks
Ridin' with half a tank, that means you only loco
We run through Interpol, you only run from Popo
Public intoxication, hard habits far from breaking
Live by the rules and regulations of a gangsta' nation

Hook:
We of the platinum patron
Tell them give me more
Cause I'll wait up around til' they give me more
Cups up, cups up
They keep going down
We of the platinum patron
Give me another round
Ay ay, I don't need no round to bring them bottle down
She don't need no round, bring them bottle down
We don't need no rounds, bring them bottle down
On that platinum patron

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
I was built to never fall
Have no fear for none of y'all
Bottle popping alcohol, it's pourin' like Niagara Falls
We the ones they creepin' with
Freaking off, and sleepin' with
You thirsty, aggressive
Too possessive tryin' to keep the bitch
I'm moving like a million pills, like a ton of bricks
Feel like you a killer when you softer than some baby shit
Here come my train of thought rolling down Scoop DeVille tracks
So make it heavy cause these bitches 'bout to feel that

Hook:
We of the platinum patron
Tell them give me more
Cause I'll wait up around til' they give me more
Cups up, cups up
They keep going down
We of the platinum patron
Give me another round
Ay ay, I don't need no round to bring them bottle down
She don't need no round, bring them bottle down
We don't need no rounds, bring them bottle down
On that platinum patron
