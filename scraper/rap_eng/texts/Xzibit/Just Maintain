[Verse 1: Xzibit & J-Ro]
I look you in your grill and I laugh inside
Niggas always perpetrating like they down to ride
But please don't try to tell me what I can not see
What's the real definition of a fake MC?
Muthafuckas only rapping since '93 and expect all props
Them gettin dropped like hot rocks
"So stop what they doing cause I'm about to ruin"
Like Shock-G, get turned to stone tryin to rock me
I separate my thought process from stress, 24 tracks inside my brain
Tyrin to maintain
I bang shit without no gang or Jherri curls
I seem like Kadeem in a whole different world
It's the girls the cars niggas lose themselves, forgettin who they are
When they try to be that superstar
You don't understand, it's all in the game plan, exploit the art
And watch hip-hop fall apart
But I'ma do my part, and stay true
And keep breaking down bitch niggas like you

[Verse 2: Hurricane Gee & Xzibit]
I'm not the type to play games or drop names
I just maintain and burn rappers out the frame
Doin my part to stay true
And keep breaking down bitch niggas like you
And above all else, I represent it for myself, leavin muthafuckas stretched out
Or better yet X-ed out
Xzibit accelerate, I rush it to the extreme like nicotine
Never get me clean from your bloodstream
We all can't bust, so do it how you must
But if you hustle, avoid gettin rushed with handcuffs plus
In God we trust but don't trust us
We just add to the ashes, then pick up the dust

[Verse 3: J-Ro & Xzibit]
Like that I make it seem like you having bad dreams
Have you wakin up out your sleep by your own screams
Xzibit has arrived Goddamit
We bout to rock the whole planet, and bitch niggas can't stand it
Try to play the back and look intense, you need to hit a fence
You don't want none of this hands-on experience
I'm no the type to play games or drop names
I just maintain and drop rappers out the frame

[Verse 4: Hurricane Gee]
I bring it to the ruffest toughest mic killers
And you wannabe niggas
And you burn bitches, type vicious
Imitating Hurricane flow for riches
You don't know the half, I got the ill vocab
Doobie rap style getting bucked
More freaky than your last good fuck
Milkin you like ba ba pieces
Meetin niggas lyrical wishes
Writin rhymes and washin out dishes
Flowin with the Likwid, wicked
Representin' with my nigga Xzibit
And we gonna do it, and do it, and do it
And do it till you satisfied!
Cause shit is tight
Bodiqua C.E.O. on the mic
Smashin and trashin', fuck Moschino fashions
All you muthafuckas need to stop askin
Valued more than the chrome on your last set of wheels, Hurricane
Here to reign on your brain, just maintain
