[Intro: Xzibit] (Jonathan Davis)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, let's go
(Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power
You gotta fight the powers that be)
Let me hear you say
(Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power
You gotta fight the powers that be)

[Jonathan Davis] (Xzibit) {Both}
1989 the number another summer (Get down)
Sound of the fucking drummer
Music hitting your heart cause I know you got soul (Brothers and sisters)
Listen if you're missing y'all
Swinging while I'm singing
Giving whatcha getting
Knowing what I know
While the whole bands sweating
{And the rhythm rhymes rolling}
Got to give us what we want (Ho)
Gotta give us what we need (Yeah)
Our freedom of speech is our freedom of death
We got to fight the powers that be

[Chorus: Jonathan Davis] (Xzibit)
(Let me hear you say)
Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power
You gotta fight the powers that be
(Let me hear you say)
Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power
You gotta fight the powers that be


[Xzibit] (Jonathan Davis)
As the rhythm designed to bounce
What counts is that the rhyme
Designed to fill your mind
Now that you've realized the prides arrived
We got to pump the stuff to make us tough
From the heart
It's a start
A work of art
To revolutionize make a change nothing's strange
People, people we are the same
No we're not the same
Cause we don't know the game
What we need is awareness
We can't get careless
You say what is this? (What is this)
My beloved lets get down to business
Mental self defensive fitness
Bum rush the show
You gotta go for what you know, yeah
And make everybody see
In order to fight the powers that be

[Chorus]

[Jonathan Davis]
Elvis was a hero to most
But he never meant shit to me you see
Straight up racist that sucker was
Simple and plain

[Xzibit]
Motherfuck him and John Wayne
Cause I'm black and I'm proud
And I'm ready, I'm hyped plus I'm amped
Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamps

[Jonathan Davis] (Xzibit)
Take  a look back and you'll look and you'll find
Rednecks for 400 years if you check
(Man Fuck Tha Police)
Was a number one jam (Yeah)
But soon as I say it they can slap me right here, fuck it

[Xzibit] (Jonathan Davis) {Both}
Let's get this party started right (Right on, come on)
What we got to say (Hey)
Power to the people no delay (Yeah)
And make everybody see
In order to {fight the powers that be}

[Chorus] x2
