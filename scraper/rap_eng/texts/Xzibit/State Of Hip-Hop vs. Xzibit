[Intro: Xzibit & Alonzo from Training Day (2001)]
Yeah, you wanna get shit done, you gotta get it done yourself
Holy Shit
Breathe
Yeah
Breath, there you go
Hahaha
Breath, dawg
Yeah!
Let it go
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, huh
Yeah, go
Go
Yes
Breathe

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm talkin' about that '64 rag-top
Clean with the back racked
Everything matte black, colder than a six pack
You know what the fuck it is and what I came to do
Now put your hands up in the air like I'm about to shoot
My agenda is here, crystal perfectly clear
Breathe apocalypse in, we have nothin' to fear
We have nothin' to lose, pressure applyin' the rules
Bust on a motherfucker and knock him up out of his shoes
That's what my coast love, good money, great drugs
Every bad bitch you can think of
Swagged out, loced out, flamed on, purve out
Shit faced from shots, your words come slurred out
Better put the word out, modified and mediocre
I'ma bust it down, serve 'em like a bunch of smokers
You can fuck around, rounds get to flyin'
Know I asked your little mind, "Is your pride worth dying over?"

[Chorus]
Yeah
Order in the court, this what you came to see?
The state of hip hop versus Mr. X to the Z
Now the verdict is in, this the moment of truth
Fightin' the fight of my life, jury ready to shoot
I be my own attorney, prosecution try to burn me down
Testimony, testifyin' from the underground
Order in the court, this what you came to see?
The state of hip hop versus Mr. X to the Z

[Verse 2]
I create in the dark, darkest place in my heart
I finish off what you started, terror, I tear you apart
I am not for them games, I'm the climb to the change
Thread the eye of the needle, that means accurate aim
That means I can arrange heinous and hideous things
I'm the sickness you feel, seconds from poppin' a vein
Paranormal presence that people can never explain
Why deal with the devil when dealin' with you is the same?
I got a proposition for all you bitches listenin'
Get in position, let me nail it like a crucifixion
Give you what you've been missin'
A man in my condition shouldn't be allowed around crowds without supervision
Call it a superstition, can't get this out my system
I got a fetish for fuckin' over my opposition
It's time to set the standard, the mother ship has landed
We didn't come here in peace, we came to take the planet

[Chorus]
Yeah
Order in the court, this what you came to see?
The state of hip hop versus Mr. X to the Z
Now the verdict is in, this the moment of truth
Fightin' the fight of my life, jury ready to shoot
I be my own attorney, prosecution try to burn me down
Testimony, testifyin' from the underground
Order in the court, this what you came to see?
The state of hip hop versus Mr. X to the Z

[Verse 3]
I come out with them wolves, they came out with them tools
To elevate you out the earth's gravitational pull
This is not for the weak, this that work for the streets
Mr. X to the Z, motherfuck what you think
Motherfuck what you blog, this for my locs and my dogs
Standin' tall, still callin' shots from behind the wall
I've been tried and I'm true, reassemble my group
Carry on tradition, position I'm put here to do
Make movements, monumental, I done made some improvements
You can check my credentials, told to never pursue it
If I listen to critics, there would be no Xzibit
Dreams battered and broken, never breakin' my spirit
Listen close, you can hear it, the footsteps of the future
Ain't no time like the present, leave the past and excuses
Fucked on everything walkin', now I keep it exclusive
You just soft as acoustic, this that real nigga music
