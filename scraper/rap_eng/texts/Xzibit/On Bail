[Intro: Daz Dillinger + (T-Pain)]
Yeah, help for the helpless!
Big money, big cars.. big weed! [T-Pain adlibs]
Y'all know what time it is! But you better stack that money!
(Awww shit! Ha ha ha ha...)
For baaaiiilll....

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm on bail, got that weight for sale
Strawberries and blueberries all on a nigga's tail
I'm on bail, bet not 'nare nigga tell... bet not 'nare nigga tell
Yeah!
I'm on bail, got that weight for sale
Strawberries and blueberries all on a nigga's tail
I'm on bail, bet not 'nare nigga tell... bet not 'nare nigga tell
Yeah!

[Verse 1: Daz Dillinger]
I'm on a two million dollar bail
Caught with the product that them young niggas sell
I'm fresh outta cells, twelve hours later.. my clientele hit my pager
The situation gettin thick, Dat Nigga Daz is major!
I live the life of a gangster, I rob gangsters
Ten years up on the table, I deny that flavor
She a fighter to the fullest, if I lose I catch a bullet (bullet)
Can't tell a nigga nuttin when he starvin and losin
Now I'm back up on the street, completely correctly
You disrespect me, it's the same that's it's gon' be
Automatics get tragic when you let niggas have it
Then I'm caught back up like before, I gotta stack my cabbage
Monday morning, 8:30 right back in court
Couple of homeboys, my momma give me full support
Raised up filthy but the Lord be with me
Like an addict, it's the verdict and the jury, "NOT GUILTY!!!"

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm on bail, got that weight for sale
Strawberries and blueberries all on a nigga's tail
I'm on bail, bet not 'nare nigga tell... bet not 'nare nigga tell
Yeah!

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
They used to have me on that paperwork
Cause I used make my paper.. work, lifestyle covered with dirt
See I was first on my block with .40 caliber Glocks
Similarities to my uncut, they ready to rock (ready to rock)
Cause everybody wanna ball, nobody wanna get caught
Only the pros and the cons get to stack these knots
Motherfuckers want that Benz with the millions by the karats
When they fencing all day, they start talkin like a parrot
Information they sharing so be cautious where ya walk
Never pillow talk behind closed doors in the dark
It might creep back and bite you, indict you, convict you
To a five by nine for a very long time
Fuck droppin dimes, niggas is droppin whole hundreds
So the hood's gettin skinny and the one-times love it
If I don't go get it, then the next nigga will
So I kill at will with my gauge in them killin fields
Yeah!

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm on bail, got that weight for sale
Strawberries and blueberries all on a nigga's tail
I'm on bail, bet not 'nare nigga tell... bet not 'nare nigga tell
Yeah!

[Verse 3: The Game]
Yo X, tell my momma to put the house up, wait, the house cost too much
Tell her to get a hundred grand out the Porsche truck
It's just like a house cause I take a bath in it
Get ass in it and I gotta stash in it
Smoke hash in it, blueberry chocolate tah
Smokin chronic make me see shit, like 2Pac alive
Bandana knotted in the front like 2Pac alive
Walkin out the courthouse spittin on the camera guy
I bang (Thug Life), but this ain't Death Row
This some gangster shit for my niggas down on death row
Exhibit A - watch how I let the tec go
And Exhibit B - burn the rubber on the West coast

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm on bail, got that weight for sale
Strawberries and blueberries all on a nigga's tail
I'm on bail, bet not 'nare nigga tell... bet not 'nare nigga tell
Yeah!
I'm on bail, got that weight for sale
Strawberries and blueberries all on a nigga's tail
I'm on bail, bet not 'nare nigga tell... bet not 'nare nigga tell
Yeah!

[Outro: Xzibit]
(laughing)
Y'all know y'all miss that shit
