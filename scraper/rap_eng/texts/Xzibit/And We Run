[Verse 1 - Sharon Den Adel]
It burns into your heart, the darkness that you fear
You were never free, and you never realized
And love is a word you've never heard
Your heart ain't cold cause it burns
A desire to leave the mire

[Pre-Chorus - Sharon Del Adel]
Take your breath 'til nothing's left
Scars of life upon your chest
And I know wherever it goes

[Chorus - Sharon Den Adel]
And we run with a lonely heart
And we run for this killing love
And we run 'til the heavens above
Yeah, we run running in the dark
And we run 'til we fall apart
And we run 'til the heavens above

[Verse 2- Xzibit]
Don't blink, you'll miss it
Lift up your head
We gotta get gone
Yeah, we outta here
Don't blink, you'll miss it
Lift up your head
Too late, we gone
Yeah, we outta here

[Chorus - Sharon Den Adel]
And we run with a lonely heart
And we run for this killing love
And we run for a heavenly heart

[Verse 3- Xzibit]
I'ma break these chains, ran through the rain
Never look back, never quit work through the pain
This blood in my veins run cold when I think it'll never be the same
But i never lose hope
This is my time now, no time for tears to celebrate
Put it in the air right now
Never back down, you'll never wear my crown
Cause it weighs too much and I crush every motherfucking thing I touch
This is love, I've never loved so much
Get involved, make the world stand up
Hear my mic before I ever give up
Name in lights, you lost all my trust
Now it's time to face all of us
Get in line cause they're calling us
And it feels marvelous, just take my hand and run

[Chorus - Sharon Den Adel]
And we run with a lonely heart
And we run for this killing love
And we run 'til the heavens above
Yeah, we run running in the dark
And we run 'til we fall apart
And we run 'til the heavens above

[Bridge - Xzibit]
Yeah, we out of here
Don't blink, you'll miss it
Lift up your head
We gotta get gone
Yeah, we outta here
Don't blink, you'll miss it
Lift up your head
Too late, we gone
Yeah, we outta here

[Chorus - Sharon Den Adel]
And we run with a lonely heart
And we run for this killing love
And we run 'til the heavens above
Yeah, we run running in the dark
And we run 'til we fall apart
And we run 'til the heavens above

[Outro - Xzibit]
Don't blink, you'll miss it
Lift up your head
We gotta get gone
Yeah, we outta here
Don't blink, you'll miss it
Lift up your head
Too late, we gone
Yeah, we outta here
