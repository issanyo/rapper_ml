[Hook: Xzibit]
I'm sorry I met you
I'm sorry I hurt you
I'm sorry I killed you
I'm sorry I murked you
Because I'm all alone now nobody is with me
Nobody to threaten that they about come get me
I wish I could go back to where we began
I wish you was alive so I could kill you again
I wish we had more paths to cross
Nobody even cares if they survive my loss
My killer's remorse

[Verse 1: Bishop Lamont]
Its funny how the same shit we laugh at
Could be the very same shit to get your bitch ass clacked
Your throat slit next now drown in your own pool out back
I kick the cats and dog too but shit I don't count that
I'm the Angel of Death I strangle till there's no breath
I kill the kill kill till there ain't nobody left
My conscience don't inhibit me I kill deliberately
Just wanna be like God, cause God kills indiscriminately
I'm so Christian I'm so Muslim
Suicide bomb your mom crib if you push em
I'm parallel to Hell I'm ready so Satan what's cooking?
And rappers running their mouth
They don't know how close their bitch ass is coked
To get turned in ghosts nigga I will kill you
Don't get it cross memories fade just as blood washes off
I said memories fade just as blood washes off
Hope to see you soon

I wish you was alive so I could kill you again
I wish we had more paths to cross
Nobody even cares if they survive my loss
My killer's remorse

[Verse 2: B-Real]
I feel so guilty my hands are filthy
From decorating your face all over the building
I'll say it sincere if I ain't making it clear
I'm writing on the wall with your blood man I wished you were here
But you moved on at your funeral I beat you with slam
I hugged your mom tell your sister and her kids to be calm
I won't tell 'em you gone you just sleep in a dream and all c'est la vie
We smoked you like the weed in the bong

[Verse 3: Demrick]
Yeah, have you ever seen the bloodstain
And know that person has returned from where he once came?
Regret is such an ugly thing only if you let it fuck with your brain
But it ain't gonna change a fucking thing
What's done is done chalk that shit up to the game
You're still dead when I'm still alive
And I never got the chance to utilize my best alibi

[Hook: Xzibit]

[Verse 4: Xzibit]
Started the bullshit escalated to violence
In result of the violence infinite permanent silence
Now I feel empty not even existing
My worst enemy is no longer against me
I remember the hatred and how it consumed me
And you felt the same thing but never could move me
A shot to the face is nothing like in the movies
The back of your brain is out the body keeps moving
So I should rejoice now because you are past tense
The last of my enemies the last of you bastards
The dirt on your casket
Now I'm so alone now you was my reason to carry my gauge or chrome out
So now I just zone out and wait for the contact
And life for the combat and now we beyond that
And I'd take it all back if I knew what I knew now
What's a shooter without somebody to shoot down?
