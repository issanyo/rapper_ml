Yeah, check it out
They say behind every strong man
Is an even stronger woman
Come on
'Cause she, was put here to defeat me
'Cause she, cuss me out, quick to leave me
'Cause she, not what I want, not what I want
'Cause she, not what I need
Yeah come on
'Cause she, blow my phone up, to reach me
'Cause she, tried to lock, now she leaves me
'Cause she, not what I want, not what I want
'Cause she, not what I need
Man, say with that suck a, she
I'm from a place, where they quick to say, "Fuck a bitch"
And gettin' grits, off of pussy, try to get a hitch
But I'm a bachelor, stackin' it, drinkin', need to quit
Me and my clique, ride through cities like we own the shit
You caught my eye, looking fly, body lookin' thick
So who am I? I reply with my government
Exchange the numbers
Escapades for days, satisfying my hunger
Don't trip, you from a long list, a long line
Get in line, you so fucking fine, you spendin' time
Introduce you as a friend of mine, never my woman
I got 20/20 cord vision, seein' you comin'
Livin' my life, I don't need a wife
But you persist, tryin' to strengthen our relationship
But I'm a dog, and a dog gotta run the streets
Without a leash, this ain't workin' so I'm sayin' peace
You ain't the one for me
'Cause she, was put here to defeat me
'Cause she, cuss me out, quick to leave me
'Cause she, not what I want, not what I want
'Cause she, not what I need
Come on
'Cause she, blow my phone up, to reach me
'Cause she, tried to lock, now she leaves me
'Cause she, not what I want, not what I want
'Cause she, not what I need
You found some way to hold on, through all the bullshit
Never seen a woman so strong, I used to pull shit
Now them days, long been gone, I gotta move in them streets
Provide a place for all my peoples to eat
I'm feelin' stuck, had to hustle up
The A.T.F., hit the house, had me shackled up
You lost your mind, hate the time, I was in and out
You never let a brother down, when you stressin' out
You stressin' wanted me, to figure out a different route
You could've left, but you a rider and stuck it out
And it's a trip, because it's like you never missed a beat
You waited anxiously, patiently, stayin' strong for me
I sat aside, thinking back to the way I was
The way I am, and how I gotta be a stronger man
I understand that you love me and you want the best
But if you wanna take the good, you gotta take the rest
I rock a vest, baby
'Cause I, run these streets for my struggle
'Cause I, carry heat for my troubles
'Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want
'Cause I, is that what you need?
Yo come on
'Cause I, want family so I'm buildin'
'Cause I, want you just for my children
'Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want
'Cause I, is that what you need?
And all this time it was you
Baby forgive me for the pain, I was puttin' you through
It's me and you against the world, so I'm keepin' it true
I know I haven't been the best, the wrong things I must do
I used to think I was the man, wasn't havin' a clue
I wasn't lookin' for no love, but I found it in you
It's so true, behind every great man is a women
Every time you call me, baby girl, I'm a come runnin'
You got a soldier livin' right, girl you saved my life
I sacrifice, anything to keep my family tight
I seen the light, and when the world try to beat me down
You always given me another reason, I can smile
'Cause you believed in me, when there was nothin' there to see
My wife can be my better half, complete my family tree
Nothin' can stop us now, wearing the wedding gown
Watchin' your father, walk his little lady down the isle
'Cause you the one for me
'Cause she, was put here to complete me
'Cause she, wooze the earth, underneath me
'Cause she, got what I want, got what I want
'Cause she, got what I need
Yeah come on
'Cause she, won't let go, she won't leave me
'Cause she, won't leave, what she don't need me
'Cause she, got what I want, got what I want
'Cause she, got what I need
Dedicated to the real ones out there
Yeah, this is for you
Yeah come on
Scent of a woman
