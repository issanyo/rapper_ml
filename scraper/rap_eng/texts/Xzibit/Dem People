[Intro: S.A.S & KXNG CROOKED]
What you gonna do? (Gangster)
What you gonna do? (Revolutionary)
What you gonna do?

If you look like me it's a crime right now
Dem people wage war on my kind right now
They wanna see me dead I ain't dying right now
That's why I got my hand on my nine right now

If you look like me it's a crime right now
Dem people wage war on my kind right now
They wanna see me dead I ain't dying right now
That's why I got my hand on my nine right now

[Verse 1: KXNG CROOKED]
Dem people fucked up everything around us
Got the slums looking like a toxic metropolis
Ain't from 'round here and you see all them dope fiends
You probably think you're walking through a zombie apocalypse
I'm a be a tour guide here grab these binoculars
Tell me if you see something prosperous (Hell no)
As far as the eye can see it's a poverty stricken populous
Rats on the ground police helicopters on top of us
Look over there, see that abandoned building?
It used to be a church where the junkies will abandon children
Gave up their babies just to shoot up it's crazy
Then the babies grow up to be addicts then the habit kills them
Can't stop the cycle 'cause it's government corruption
That's bringing the drugs in guess its up to us then
But 'us' we brain-washed yes me and you are
How can I explain to you in two bars? We FUBAR

[Chorus: S.A.S.]

[Interlude: Xzibit]
See the motherfucking problem is, the elite 1% controlled by the puppet master created fake recessions and made them billions while driving people into starvation. Imagine, a waste land created by the greedy that feeds on the poor

[Verse 2: KXNG CROOKED]
Dem people fucked up everything around us
Then they put the chemical plants right where the slums are
You ain't jealous of your neighbours' grass being greener
Cuz it ain't no grass, your front yard is sun charged
Old-ass abandoned cars looking like a junkyard
Gotta kill to live out here even the punks hard
5 star hotels homie we ain't got 1 star
Everybody look homeless can't tell who the bums are
Everything backwards nights be looking like morning
Cuz back in the day the government they missed something important
Blatantly ignored it, mother nature's warning
About global warming so when it's electrical storming
You get caught outside you could die in the rain
You know shit's insane when the sky is in pain
Another oil pipe another life that they claim
And they don't give a fuck they laughing right to the bank

[Chorus: S.A.S]
