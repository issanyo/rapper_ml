[Verse 1: Slim Da Mobster]
See me win, they'd rather see me lose
Is it the money, the ho's
The Coupé on 22's,or the fact that
Niggers just wanna come for my spot
Man it’s crowded at the bottom
Shit, it’s lonely at the top, top
Back, back and,then something forward
They say life it’s a bitch
I love to see what she’s got for me
Purple label Ralph Lauren
And we ain't talkin' bout ballin'
Because my team is without scorers
And we shoot it out like Michael Jordon
If you’re sitting on a bench
Then you’re probably not important!
Cubans imported, what I'm copping you can not afford it
We get it in over here, and money is not a shortage
So you know what beefing with me is gonna lead too
Me too, me too!
Cause then niggers can bleed too
You talk a good one
But, I don’t believe you!

[Hook:Xzibit]
They say a picture worth a thousand words
Picture slim with a thousand birds Walked up and ready to serve
They say a man’s true worth is his word
Every word I spit, I spit the truth, the testament
Come on!
You can say what you gonna do, all that you want to
But I don’t believe you!
I hear you talking mother fucker!
But, I don’t believe you!

[Verse 2: Slim Da Mobster]
Nigga, slim a savage
My money fall from average
Not the one you wanna challenge
In white on white challenger
Guns in all calibers
Stunnin' all calendar
Keep getting money till this shit starts piling up
I feel sorry for the niggers, think they wild as us
Fuck around I'll Frank White your funeral!
I hear you talking, nigga!
But I don’t believe you!
Aha!
Probably easier said than dunn
DRE told me to be patient and my time would come!
I am the one like after zero
I get that dream team money I can afford to pay roll
Kush feeling my cigarillo ..with the zigs stuffed in the pillow
And you niggers better stay real low,for real thou
I hear you talking, but I don’t believe you!
