[Verse 1: Xzibit]
Yeah
X to the Z
Wiz Khalifa
Everyday lead to late nights
Bitches on my neck like a vampire appetite
Homie, pass me a light, I got that master kush
Gave birth to you bastards, told your momma to push
Now here you are, I see you're feeling strong
My prediction came here tripping, you won't be living long
Wait, I said that wrong, now let's negotiate
I wave my banner of peace, I hope you take the bait
Pussy nigga, you fake, can't wait for the face to face
Hit you with the gauge, back in place
Rip another page off the book of life
But for tonight we gon' celebrate and smoke 'till we elevate
My motive for motivating my niggas, come on

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa and (Xzibit)]
Take a look at my eyes and tell me what do you see
(I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G)
All this liquor I drink and then I smoke all this weed
(Smoking this weed, smoking is good, but I got what you need)
A lot of niggas are changed and they be doing what I've been
(Won't you change, I want you stay the same)
But I'll always be the same, I'll always gonna keep it G
(I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G)

[Verse 2: Xzibit]

It's getting hard to survive, the streets will eat you alive
Dumping your body, your cadaver is covered with flies
Too much ratchets and trapping inside your rapping
Real niggas actually laughing at your lights, camera, action
Do you, do you
And whatever the fuck you think you gotta do
Because when I bring it through, we whole court
Putting up playoff stats
While you're hanging with the roaches and rats
We're way above that
Now how you're loving that?
Beat the breaks off the back of that bitch
You can't breathe, I'm digging your ditch
Can't believe I'm that deep in your shit
But for tonight we gon' celebrate and smoke 'till we elevate
My motive for motivating my niggas, come on

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa and (Xzibit)]
Take a look at my eyes and tell me what do you see

(Won't you change, I want you stay the same)
But I'll always be the same, I'll always gonna keep it G
(I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G)

[Verse 3: Xzibit]

The greatest trick the devil ever put together
Was that self destruction is better than striving for perfection
A seed of doubt could grow, quickly spread like an infection
Initiative to live, use your common sense as a weapon
If you only knew half of this shit that I've been through
Should've been a screen play when I get through
Blow niggas away, IED, point blank range in the middle of the street
Fuck y'all niggas gonna say to me?
We don't play no games, just play for keeps and now
Back to the forefront, back to the back who was back on the tour bus
Get around the world for a few months
Dump dead-weight niggas like a dump truck
But for tonight we gon' celebrate and smoke 'till we elevate
My motive for motivating my niggas, come on
