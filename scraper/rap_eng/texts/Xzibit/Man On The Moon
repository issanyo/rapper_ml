[Verse 1: Young De]
Man, I'm out of touch with the regular
My brainwaves on the same page as cellulars
I see in Hi-D resolution
A 5G revolution with plans and solutions
Check the stations, same conversations
That's old floor mats, leave 'em at the doormat
WAVE files, .avi's, and .mp3's
Today is the same as a child learning his ABC's
It's the way of the world - goodbye CDs
And DVD's - it's 3D inside the TV screens
So now I can do anything
Without the kind of luck that a penny brings
Uploaded my music; it happened so quickly
Now they at the show singin' right along with me
The future is here - I'll take you there
But you will have to catch me - come and get me

[Hook: Young De]
I'm takin' off, takin' off, takin' off
I'm outta here, outta here, I'm gone
You can catch me if you can
But I'm gone, I'm gone
We outta here
We outta here

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Weightless - I can see the continents
Rollin' in my space ghost; Rolls Royce rocketship
I'm bringin' back intelligence from space
From the heavens that'll take us up into a higher place
Prepare for the equinox
Infinite possibilities eatin' with the astronauts
Yeah, I hide my secrets in the sun
That way nobody ever looks directly into what I was
It's only what I have become
Not a public enemy, but still my Uzi weighs a ton
My Millennium Falcon is flawless
I warp lightyears away from these typical artists
Heartless - I ain't got no soul
I devour everything within my reach like a black hole
I'm in yo' city like a titty full of silicone
Get off that old shit, Macbook is killin' Chrome

[Hook]
