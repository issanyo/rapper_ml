Hahhhh! Yeah!
Ladies and gentlemen, yeah! 2001!

[Verse 1:]
Look I'm better than you and I can prove it
Set up your best defense I run through it
Check out the play by play with John Madden
Xzibit and EA Sports we come smashin'
Yeah! Its all in the game
Let me explain, bringing the fame
You can set it off in the rain, set it off in the snow
Forth down and one to go
Run your own franchise boilin' with Team Ecko
I'm here for one thing to smash the other team
Breaking you down, everything you pass is out of bounds and incomplete
Ecko unlimited athletes making you stumble and fumble
Your offense in deep trouble
Yeah!

[Hook:]
In that field, feel the power! (Yeah, yeah!)
Only thing you hittin' is the ground in the showers (Uhhh)
Playbook full of technique I'm playing for keeps (Yeah)
Mouthpiece, put on your pads and tighten your clets (Ahhhhhhhha!)
In that field, feel the power! (Yeah)
Only thing you hittin' is the ground in the showers (Uhhh)
Playbook full of technique I'm playing for keeps
Mouthpiece, put on your pads and tighten your clets (Yeah)

[Verse 2:]
Check the stats the numbers don't lie
Your quaterback throw lame ducks that don't fly
22 players with a passion to play
Top of Madden football at home always
Brought to you live by EA Sports
Try to rush for the first down but still fell short (Yeah!)
You hear the support from thousands of fans (*crowd cheering*)
Up in the stands pushin' off Superbowl plans
You will contact EA Sports you realize the facts (Yeah)
You might have kicked it off or caught the ball and ran it back
Welcome to the dog house you getting blown out
After the game you see the Madden bus rollin' out
[Bus driving by] Yeah!

[Hook:]
In that field, feel the power! (Yeah!)
Only thing you hittin' is the ground in the showers (cmon)
Playbook full of technique I'm playing for keeps
Mouthpiece, put on your pads and tighten your clets (Ahhhhhhhha!)
In that field, feel the power! (Uhhh)
Only thing you hittin' is the ground in the showers (Yeah)
Playbook full of technique I'm playing for keeps
Mouthpiece, put on your pads and tighten your clets
Yeah
