[Verse 1]
Yeah, you thought that this was over
Thought you got away with murder
Watch me murder my deserters
This is congress secret service
Got your epirdermis calling
From the toxins in the water
Use the oxygen to slaughter
This is big business, baby, blood money bringing benefits
Still suffer from the ideology of Willie Lynch
Now it's all making sense, lets breed ignorance
Cause ignorance is bliss, watch the bliss make us filthy rich, bitch

[Hook]
I'm okay now, bring the napalm
I'll fly over and blow you away
No more sunshine, no more playgrounds
I'll fly over and blow you away now
There's no glamour, no guts, no glory
When I fly over, and blow you away
Blow you away now
The fuck can you say now?
I'm loading my napalm

[Verse 2]
The last shall be first, got dammit planet here we go
Camouflage cowboy, saddle up; rodeo
HIV, Polio, positive identity
Ashes of evil because we can't believe the trinity
Homeland Security, false is superiority
Fuck your intentions and big plans for my community
I ain't afraid to die, fuck you gon' do with that?
I'm coming to find you and wipe you off the fucking map, brrat

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I just wanted to live my life like the common man
Have a family, a picket fence with a couple friends
Maybe even walk the dog when the night is right
Such a pretty picture, we dancing under flashing lights
And we wouldn't have a worry, not in the world at all
Watch my favorite sitcom and go outside and mow the lawn
I come inside just in time to see our baby walking
And bringing flowers ain't special because I do it often
I'll be working a 9 to 5 'till I'm old and grey
Then just wither away the dust, watch it float away
And it'll be complete my life because I lived it right
Never lifted my voice in anger just to pacify
I guess it's all eventual how all these chips should fall
How can you appreciate walking if you have never crawled?
Matter of fact, why am I talking, I should be standing tall
Instead I'm in a world full of shit steaming, screaming fuck 'em all
Aerosol arsonist, tagging up the Apocalypse
The narcoleptic masses so I bang completely opposite
All you need is confidence, I don't need no compliments
The system sets the standards, destruction of the obvious
This is for the populous, population genocide
Patriotic duty look alive but never sympathize
Take 'em by surprise, strike 'em early when they rise
When they open up they eyes, but they still so fucking blind
But hey, hey

[Hook]

[Outro]
