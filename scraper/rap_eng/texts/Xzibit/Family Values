[Intro / Chorus: Xzibit]
This how you make me feel, this how you make me feel
This how you make me feel, that's how I know it's real
Take you around the world, take you around the world
Take you around the world, take you around the world
Cause you my baby girl, cause you my baby girl
Cause you my baby girl, cause you my my my
Cause you my baby girl, cause you my baby girl
Cause you my baby girl, cause you my my my

[Xzibit]
This how you make me feel, that's how I know it's real
Take you around the world, cause you my baby girl
I know you feelin good, I know you feelin right
You see me ridin, you ridin wit me your shit is tight
Self-made millionaire I find myself
My success God bless not defined by wealth, c'mon
We live in crazy times, niggas done lost they minds
We wanna fuck every fuckin chicken we fuckin find
But then there comes a time, when you start to grow
But you ain't growin with me and it's startin to show
Before I say I can't live without ya
Let's sit and have a talk about family values, now listen
I see you got some kids, that you ain't never with
Your baby father put hands on you, some crazy shit
So he gon' pay for that, fuck with niggas who rap
Most of that quality time is spent on your back
Now before I devote the rest of my life
Can you at least show a nigga you can boil some rice
(ha ha ha) Is that too much to ask, am I movin too fast
Do you have anything to offer me besides some ass
You think you high class, the upper echelon
But spend all your rent money in the hair salon
I'm 'sposed to help you out, but it just made me think
You ain't ready for the world, you ain't ready for me

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
Damn baby I see they drivin you crazy
Because your body's amazing I know you want it to phase me
But hey - I seen a lot of girls, messed up a lot of curls
You ain't gon' keep me with sex when only sex occurs
Want you to think ahead, not just give me head
Want you to make a household baby, not just a bed
I know the scene is what you seem to see
Where you needin to be, but believe you me
Baby girl they just gon' use you up, fuck you and bruise you up
They ain't got no family values they ain't gon' choose you up
We disrespect ourselves, we think we livin well
I could be wrong in this song but only time'll tell
You may be thinkin hey X, you just a hypocrite
You actin like you never called a girl a fuckin bitch
Nah it's not that (that) but it's like this (this)
We need change and I'm just man enough to say the shit

[Chorus - 2X]
