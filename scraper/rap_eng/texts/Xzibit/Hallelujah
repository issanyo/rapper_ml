[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Rejoice real hip hop is back!

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah [x2]

[Verse 1: Bishop Lamont]
Good morning church let's open up our bibles
Wrap up recitals, let's discuss these wack rhymers backsliders
Mindless spineless by their own jury
They blinded by chain after chain cause they used to being slaves
Kuntas, kuntas tap dance for your advance
Then lie to all the field niggas bout how you got your chance
Swear you been a renegade but nigga please you've been afraid
Go get Master his lemonade
And stop with all your street charades
You a gangster, you a gangster when did this happen
At magnet school in drama class
When you was learnin' acting and dope dealin'
Scene stealin' made a perfect villain
The labels need new acts you act so what a perfect fill- in
Fill in the blanks but never can replace the feeling
Of real music real Hustlers that been through it
Real ryders, real rhymers who give they lives to it
And you with me say amen
It's Time For Real Music

[Hook: Xzibit]
Congregation please stand receive the blessing
From my motherfuckin' hands
Sip holy water, I walk through the promise land
It's Bishop Lamont my heel crush the devil head
Hip Hop is Dead
That's what the devil says
It's all about swag
That's what the devil says
Len me some cash
That's what the devil says
Bless the track partake my daily bread

[Verse 2: Bishop Lamont]
When they state they keep it real
They really mean
They keep it fake peace means war
One love is one hate
A stab in the back the same as a handshake
It's Hollywood, Hollywierd
Where your favorite rapper goes and disappears
Off the planet like an alien abduction
Next album first single sounds strange
When he be bussin'
It must be that Scientology
Or blow that he been snuffing
Or a combo or both
Let's take a trip to the coast
Be rockstars in 5 stars hotels in Overdose MTV Diary doesn't come close
You think you know but you have no idea
About the demons and schemin' that goes on here

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bishop Lamont]
Unholy trinity: sex, drugs and alcohol
Your biggest artist, from these came their downfall
Even right now as you listen it surround ya'll
And me too that's why you know that I'm not lyin', naw
Now these stars wanna blow their brain to venus
And die outside the club
Be the next River Phoenix
I mean correction
I mean Heath Ledger
Who would think an Olsen Twin would deal that deadly pleasure
But this no sitcom, So try and sit calm
While I read you more scripts of the Bishop Psalm
From the streets and this business many disappear
They both will promise you swallow then shed no tear
You know they're sayin'
They'll have a new nigga next year
Don't let them take your soul
Like they took Shakir
Don't let them take hold
Keep your vision clear
You never know that could be me or you next year

[Hook]
