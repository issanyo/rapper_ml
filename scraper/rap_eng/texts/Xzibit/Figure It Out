Yo... Young De
Mr. You know me...
Broadcasting live from Los Angeles

[Hook: Xzibit & Young De]
Wait now let me guess, I'll see how this go
You don't knuckle up, just pull your pistol
You can't fuck with us, I launch a missile
You know from this close I can't miss so
So figure it out
I don't care for what you saying
I'm praying for you motherfuckers thinking I'm playing
I'm playing till the 4-5 starts the spraying
You niggas explaining, I thought you was banging, lets figure it out!

[Verse 1: Young De]
That you a gangster, rider, hustler
Which one are you, and what you gonna do
When it go down, pop off
Go hard, come soft
Then you get pumped like a chump in the lunch hall
Unregistered heat, that's a gun charge
Two clips one gun, that's a menage
(Yeah!) And we can see through the facade
Most pressure you ever had on your back was a massage
It's all fun and games until somebody get got
People start arguing somebody get shot
Police investigate, and what if you get caught
Now you the latest addition to the maximum state prison
I'm just a hard-headed nigga that can't listen
My motto is if it ain't broke don't fix it
My trigger finger itches
If you start tripping I'mma pull that four-fifth and ride!

[Hook: Xzibit & Young De]
Wait now let me guess, I'll see how this go

I'm praying for you motherfuckers thinking I'm playing
I'm playing till the 4-5 starts the spraying
You niggas explaining, I thought you was banging, lets figure it out!

[Verse 2: Young De]

But this shit ain't a math problem
When you have beef with mad niggas with straps on 'em
Subtract your ego and carry a two
'Fore a bullet flies and divides you and your crew
That's why so longs as I'mma live illegal
I'm not a shook one like that Mobb Deep single
A black polo, hoodie, and a pea-coat
Ain't what I meant when I said I keep the heat close
There's way to many fake ass Nino Brown's
Running around that's down to they last C-Note
It's Cali baby, catch a fade without the barbershop
Got you and your pride lying out on the side walk
The cops is still using the same old white chalk
And (?) is still carrying (?)
They ain't asking for time when they say "You got a watch?"
They mean you back where you at, and how you talk

[Verse 3: Mykestro]
A mix with Mayweather, now way better since
I put tips on a motherfucker so I save us the itch
She's looking outta your favor, the flame of the fifth
Put an end to that corageous shit
No such thing as part time banging where I'm from
Ain't no can occasional crips, trip!
When you face a permanent vacation and your prints on paper
Ain't no shaking his hand, that's some real shit!
Would you rather be caught with it, or without it?
It's hard as if you wanna be in it, or around it?
Detectives will flock when the hectic
The hecklering (?) come out
I send a spectrum of shots (Raaaahh!)
I Paul (?) that peer pressure to pop
Whether it stays important or shall I undress (Look)
I Shoot first ask questions last
The AK to them niggas with the neverending (?
