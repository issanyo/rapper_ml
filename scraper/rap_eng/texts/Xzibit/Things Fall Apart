[Verse 1: Xzibit & Demrick]
Got a call from the homie
Never stall for the homie, bet it all on the homie, huh
I'd kill your mom for my homie
Never robbed, never owe me, at the top and it's lonely, huh
I smoke the bomb with my homie
Got the bomb? Better show me, better act like you know me, huh
I was back to back with your homie
He attack and it show me I can only be the only one, huh
You see what greed do to people? We was partners
Equal money turn a motherfucker evil
You went and did me dirty like a needle
Watch it swoop with the eagle, leave you blind in the fetal
Now you lyin' to my face, so deceitful
Where that duffel bag with the 50 racks
That was sittin' in the back of my Regal?
There will not be a sequel
I will kill you right now, reach is long and it's lethal

[Chorus: Demrick]
Things fall apart, they were good at the start
You were searchin' for your heart but you never found it
Tried to double-cross, now look at what it cost
Another life lost with the chalk around it
Things fall apart, they were good at the start
You were searchin' for your heart but you never found it
Tried to double-cross, now look at what it cost
Another life lost with the chalk around it

[Verse 2: B-Real]
Curve what you doin', yeah I heard about your union
'Bout the bag you're pursuin', let me get in, I'm your ruin
Got another plan brewin' with another crew rulin'
Keep your mouth shut, end up in a hearse, car foolin'
Got a warehouse coolin' with the source plug toolin'
Every day they movin' packs out the back
I'm assumin' they got the security loomin'
We can calculate the movement
Hit 'em in the blind spot, hit 'em hard when we swoop in
Have the van ready, loopin' 'round the block for the scoopin'
Don't be nothin' stupid, stay focused, no confusion
At the spot, call Susan, stay put and don't be movin'
I'm the one who lets you in, hold the bag or we losin'
If you think you a shoe-in for the paper we be lootin'
Don't be tryna double-cross me, I'll be comin' at ya shootin'
I don't trust another human, salty bitches, they be stewin'
Sell me out, I'll be waitin' in the shadows, I'll put two in (Bop, bop)

[Chorus: Demrick]
Things fall apart, they were good at the start
You were searchin' for your heart but you never found it
Tried to double-cross, now look at what it cost
Another life lost with the chalk around it
Things fall apart, they were good at the start
You were searchin' for your heart but you never found it
Tried to double-cross, now look at what it cost
Another life lost with the chalk around it
