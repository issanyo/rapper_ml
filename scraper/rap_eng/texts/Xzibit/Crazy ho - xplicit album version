I'd leave the girl alone, but the bitch keeps callin' me
All day and all night long, she just keeps callin' me
She says she'll kill herself if I try to let her go
Somebody pray for me 'cause I'm stuck with a crazy ho
Comin' from a cat, that uhh
Believed that if wasn't nobody else in the world to pimp
He'll probably pimp himself, that's me, Suga Free
Dig that, yeah, again? Uhh X man, y'know
If I don't slap her man, she feel like I don't love her
You know what I'm talkin' about?
This thing takes all kinds of turns and switches and changes
You know it's called the P Steady
I'd leave the girl alone, but the bitch keeps callin' me
All day and all night long, she just keeps callin' me
She says she'll kill herself if I try to let her go
Somebody pray for me 'cause I'm stuck with a crazy ho
Woman out the wilderness bitch
The homies say you got a wildebeest piece
But she a dime piece, her mind lost, thrown off course
She been divorced twice, overwhelmed by bad advice
From a past life, she crazy though
Call my telephone a hundred times in a row
I don't know how to let her go
I'm stuck with this ho, pardon me
But she ain't nuttin' but the worst part of me
She even threatened to slice her artery
I gotta watch my God Degree
She tried to voodoo the peas
And throw her eyelashes in the recipe
Please, it's more than she's spittin' in my lemonade
And R.Kelly ain't got the right to sing the hook like Butch
Yeah, come on, spit it
I'd leave the girl alone, but the bitch keeps callin' me
All day and all night long, she just keeps callin' me
She says she'll kill herself if I try to let her go
Somebody pray for me 'cause I'm stuck with a crazy ho
Now since chickens of a feather be cluckin' together
And I met her through Aiesha, I should've known better
She a professional charger Laker chaser
The kind that'll lie and say one of 'em raped her
But she in love with a gangsta
And it's been all trivial since the day that I janked her
Swore she wasn't ghetto but I met her at Fairmont
Shoulda knew she was a gangsta
When she said that it wasn't her man's car
But now she crazy over me
Tryin' to OD, 'cause she can't be with me
She'll fuck with different sets just to bring you beef
Fake a pregnancy just to get you fo' a G, crazy
How much can one man take?
Worried if I leave it's her life she'll take
So I'm stuck here livin' life in fear
Situation so severe
I need to change my ways
Pay more attention to the her hopefully
Thinkin' with my dick every night and day
And the bitch won't go away
Girl stop screamin'
All in front of my house, tellin' everybody you not leavin'
And just beat it, you're insane
Crazy and deranged and I don't need you
Look, don't make me repeat it
I'mma say it one time, kick rocks or I'm a call the one time
I should've hollered at your sister
We went to the same high school, plus she finer than you
Hey, baby this one's on you
You know it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none too
You dug my man out, your hand's out, askin' for help
Hey, go 'head trick, kill yourself
I'd leave the girl alone, but the bitch keeps callin' me
All day and all night long, she just keeps callin' me
She says she'll kill herself if I try to let her go
Somebody pray for me 'cause I'm stuck with a crazy ho
And that's what I'm talkin' about, Suga Free
Up in here with Xzibit you know I'm sayin', west coast big style
We really doin' this out here fo' real homey
You know what I'm sayin', you all get to know
You know what I'm sayin'
You'll get to know yo' folks a little bit better too
If you just uhh, recognize this P, you know what I mean?
You know what I'm sayin'
We respect the hip hop, we respect the whole 9
You know what I'm talkin' about pimpin'
The bud is greener and the grass is greener
You know what I'm talkin' about
The pimpin' is cleaner and mackin' is meaner
You know what I'm sayin', dig that
You can be a stand up ho or a fall down bitch
And we mean this out here on the west, now
