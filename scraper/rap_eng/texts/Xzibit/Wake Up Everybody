(Chauncey Hannibal)
Wake up, everybody
No more sleepin' in bed
No more backward thinkin'
Time for thinkin' ahead

The world has changed
So very much
From what it used to be
There is so much hatred
War and poverty, whoa, oh

Wake up, all the teachers
Time to teach a new way
Maybe then they'll listen
To what'cha have to say

'Cause they're the ones who's coming up
And the world is in their hands
When you teach the children
Teach 'em the very best you can

(Chours)
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be, na, na, na
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah
Just you and me

(Ad-libs:Chauncey Hannibal)
The world won't get no better, Yeah
Let it be, No
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it
Just you and me, Yeah
