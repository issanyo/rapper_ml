[Verse 1: Xzibit]
This is the long drop method, supposed to be more humane
Measure your height and your weight to break your neck when you hang
Sometimes they use a short drop or they use a crane
Either way the victim dies in agonizing pain
But if the calculations incorrect when the rope's set
The rope will rip the head right off a motherfuckers neck
My appointment at the gallows x emerging from the shadows
With a vendetta better who wanna battle
Man you gon' get whipped and flogged
Shackled to an A-frame
Beaten full force until you can't repeat your own name
Until you smell the smell of burning flesh (yes)
Keep you alive until you pray for death (yes)
Drawn and quartered, disemboweled till there's nothing left
Saudi Arabia amputation for petty death
Li chin translated this the leader in death
A rubber tire filled with gas around your arms and chest
Set you on fire turn your body to a melted mess
Ask the AT about that south African necklace
Go ahead and pick your poison, get what's coming to you
Call me the brazen bull, I came to fucking kill you

[Hook]
???? must I come through merciless
Bequeath me with that bullshit you utter
Uncut raw, what, and we ride through
And always remember that death will come on swift wings
Anyone who're uncontested now, have we now ?????
I came to kill

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Hands behind your back shackled and I forced you to kneel
Shoot you in the back of the head, send your family the bill
For what the bullets cost, I'm on my China shit
Eye for an Eye waterboard you like my government
Impaled and left at the front gates
You should hear the sound a broken arm rib and leg makes
When being pulled apart, call that the breaking wheel
