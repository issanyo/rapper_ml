[Verse 1:]
Introducin' the X-Man, phenomenal
X-Files, the chronicle
Aerostatical, nautical
Magnificent beast
Xzibit stick to the logic
You can be bullish and rollick
Yo ass will still get demolished
Polished, and keeping' a mulish
My niggas eat like piranhas
We party stupid, retarded
Most niggas jaded and guarded
Cause they not popular product
This ain't no Gucci or Prada
This is a topless Impala
North Hollywood body armor
For when they come with the drama
(For when they come with the drama.)
So I continue the saga
Move out the path of the lava
Move in position and conquer
You have created a monster
Wake up and call out the culprit
I never weaken or soften
Might catch me weezin' and coughin'
Because I blaze very often
I need to knock this shit off of shit
I got problems my nigga
And they get bigger and bigger
You can not solve, what a thriller
This is a pivotal moment
This is my time of atoning
This is my world and I own it
So come and take if you want it
Please God forgive me for sinnin'
Winnin', and makin' a killin'
Witness revenge of the villains
Sexual healin' from women
I bust a nut to their ceilin'
I crash a plain in their buildin'
But now I'm married with children
Katal and balance the millions
I'm in another direction
Life bless is taking it's blessin's
You need to hear my confession
Forever walk with a weapon
I live and die like a soldier
(I live and die like a soldier)
C'mon let's take this shit over

[Verse 2:]
Make patches and master my master piece
Niggas have the audacity
Trynna adapt to capacities
Of your highness, your majesty
What the fuck is you asking me?
With my accurate accuracy
Immaculate faculties
With a nation in back of me
I see promising situations evolve into tragedies
I just hustle and hustle because it comes to me naturally
I'm a buffalo soldier clappin' you back to Jehovah
C'mon let's take this shit over
(C'mon let's take this shit over.)
I'm a super nova eclipse
On your current events
This ain't no novelty spittin' hotter than barbeque bits
Lorena Bobbit, you ditched!
Trigger's still good in my grip
You showin' off for the cameras while I just stick to the script
People get Hollywood quick
When people thinkin' you sinkin'
I got everybody thinkin' I got a problem with drinkin'
I'm just enjoyin' my weekends so stay the fuck out my business!
I roll with serial killers
(We fuckin' serial killers.)
