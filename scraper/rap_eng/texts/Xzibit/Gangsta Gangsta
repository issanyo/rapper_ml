[Verse 1: Xzibit]
Witness the downfall of man
I wanna kill you for your land, I am the nuclear reactor
Leaking in Japan, I am ill gotten gains I quickly exchange hands
March to the heart beat of the city
You only hear the drums when they attached to the semi
You know what time it is?
Flavor with a thousand checks, it’s like the ice ring surrounds my neck
I never worry about the referee
The gate keepers keep him locked for me
But so is Shaolin, Forever
Always will be underground X to the motherfucker Z
Fought it all with the mighty King T, where my gangstas at?
Hit the park, bailed out the car seen
Blue and red everywhere, look how strong we are
So there will be no warning shots
I’m about to get my city boiling hot and make ‘em pray for rain
And make ‘em say my name, let off more smoke than a coal powered train
This is, Concentration, determination, the very thin line between
Paradise and incarceration

[Hook]
Gangsters, gangsters
Gangsters, stand up and rep what you’re claiming
Police roll around, shake us down, always playing and I…
Gangsters, gangsters
Streets made me into this man, gotta represent who I am

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
They say right before you day you get the eerie feeling of peace
Then walk into the light
My soul won't be taken without a fight
She says she wanna spend the whole life
But she only got me here for one night
Set your sights, better get it in. Call your best friend
Imma call you wonder-twins
Stop and go like red light traffic
Innovation make it another classic, we made it happen
And big hip hop budgets got cut
Niggas did too much then the feds popped up
And now the game fucked up, ‘cause the lanes clogged up, but the content sucks
I wanna fill up some big rig trucks, time to tour the whole world
Motherfuckers line up
‘cause these tickets gone move like crack
Entire west coast got my back
And y’all niggas saying fuck it with that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
Can’t even rely on your own eyes
Everything fake now, toast to the bad guys
That will leave ya hog tied swimming with the fishes
Part machine, part skill, part intuition
I cooked my first ounce in my father’s kitchen
He caught me with a Mac 11, twenty grand and half a chicken
I was shitting on myself and still I let him know
That if he turn me they'd turn around and kill us both
Cos it's a cold world, but I’m a polar bear
Destroy the earth like a solar flare, best beware of us
In God we trust, but everybody else gotta pay cash up front
Call Farrakhan to back me down
I’m on a level now, speak like a minister
Focus study my literature
Clean house, taking out the trash
I’m in the fly zone, where your past, I'm gangsta, yeah

[Hook]
