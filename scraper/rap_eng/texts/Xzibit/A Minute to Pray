[Intro]
Yeah, it's been a long time
Welcome back, yeah
Our Father, who art in Heaven
Got niggas jumpin out the buildin like 9/11, c'mon

[Xzibit]
Only God could save us
I done burned down the town and killed my neighbor
Do I, come to you for my early demise? (yeah)
A minute to pray, it only take a second to die

Niggas ain't prepared, too scared to do it
Dippin cigerettes in embalmin fluid
Hoods, special effects bring the drama to it
But sue me if you wanna see the trauma youth
I'm a walkin time bomb, don't tick me off
Crucified to die, nailed to the cross
Natural transition, foot soldier to boss
The A.K. ricochet put blood in your cough
And you know the whole fucked up part of it all?
Take a muh'fucker's life somebody comin for yours
It's the get-back gangstas don't believe in karma
Only the strength of the dollar and the body armor
You the bitch ass nigga or a man of honor
My hands wrap around your throat like a anaconda
Then squeeze 'til your eyes pop out of your face
Then relocate to a brand new space (yo)

[Chorus: Xzibit]
Only God could save us (yeah)
I done burned down the town and killed my neighbor (yeah)
Do I, come to you with blood on my hands (yeah)
Or run away from the place that I stand? WHO THE FUCK I AM, YEAH!
Only God could save us
I done burned down the town and killed my neighbor
Do I, come to you for my early demise?
A minute to pray, it only take a second to die

[Xzibit]
I used to snatch people out of cars with a shotgun
Now I give cars to people who ain't got one
Still got the shotgun, whole different lifestyle
Kill you with a crowbar, wrapped in a white towel
Gotta play it smart now, the streets is watchin
The streets dictate the beats so my beats be knockin
Fuck a Strong Arm, I'll drop your coffin
Yeah yeah, muh'fucker I hear you talkin
Niggas so often take kindness for weakness
Heat-seekin G with the elite on some cheap shit
This my square boy, you can't take me out of it
You want war nigga you better bring a lot of it
I ain't a problem with puttin my problems to rest
You so pussy, boy you need a gynocologist
The hand, the bullet, the firin pin
Please God forgive me for I have sinned, Amen

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
Huh, hit a nigga, kill a nigga will come back
Murder rap never attached, got too many snaps
It's more than raps, it's actual facts
Welcome back to the West, left side of your map
Been attacked from all sides, it's time for the payback
Lay back, wait for the right time to spray that
Spray that motherfucker, down to the last clip
Last clip you save for the cop on some waive shit
Blaze haze for days; shocked, stunned, amazed
Bitch best behave or take the fade
Blaze Shade-45 in the all-black Bentley
If I gotta go, y'all niggas comin with me
Simply put, Mobb Deep said y'all were (Shook)
And when I come through, you just look
We don't change the game, we close the book
I let you go now, I know you got crack to cook, c'mon

[Chorus - 2X]
