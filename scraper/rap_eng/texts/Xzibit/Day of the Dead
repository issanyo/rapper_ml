[Intro]
Take a deep breath in, and let it out
Another deep breath in, and let the air flow out
Inhale again, and let your whole body open up with the air

[Verse 1: Demrick & Xzibit]
Niggas think sheet like aromatic
Went got your face tatted, now you the hardest on the planet
Tell the real ones, swoop, take advantage
Now, poof, puppet master got you dancin' for the cameras
Light your fuckin' face up like jack-o'-lanterns
Safehouse, find police signals on the scanner
Man with a gauge I seen you comin' on the camera
Better with age, I'm magic like abracadabra
Hit with a slug and turn you into a cadaver
Split you in half, I'll put your mind all over matter
You lightin' the ass, I'm knockin' Jacob off the ladder
So fuck the chitter-chatter, make the whole room scatter like
Roaches in the kitchen when the light switches
Or the killer come back to get the eye witness
And that stripper get old and they stop spendin'
Damn, this world could be cold when you not winnin'

[Chorus]
I'm not familiar, in touch with my feelings
I have no compassion
Make your world come crashin' down
Mine for the taking, my motivation
No conversation
Yeah, bitch, don't fuck around
Celebrate, it's the day of the dead
Celebrate, it's the day of the dead
Celebrate, it's the day of the dead
Celebrate, it's the day of the dead

[Verse 2: B-Real]
Green thumb's what my name is, fuck you
My barrel is aimed out where your brain is
It'll be painless, trust me, let me operate
Isolate the sound in your head, let it resonate
Don't hesitate, don't ever wait
Rhyme's up, ho, can't resuscitate, no
Took your breath away, ever great
How do you feel, you Magnum steel cold bitch?
Heart of stone, blue steel, seen her on the news reel
She got a red dress on with some new heels
Blowin' kisses for a new kill, seen the proof spill
Out like a waterfall on the wall
Wanted more bloodshed, start a war
Love's dead, pardon me y'all
A witness to the hit list
Barrels lightin' up and they can't miss
Aw shit, this is really happening
Fuckin' added in, not a rerun
It's all slappenin'

[Chorus]
I'm not familiar, in touch with my feelings
I have no compassion
Make your world come crashin' down
Mine for the taking, my motivation
No conversation
Yeah, bitch, don't fuck around
Celebrate, it's the day of the dead
Celebrate, it's the day of the dead
Celebrate, it's the day of the dead
Celebrate, it's the day of the dead
