I feel it live when I touch the ball
I can't fall, I can't fail
Locking down the court like a cell
Treat my team like my brothers
Haters don't understand me
Hard fouls, them hecklers tryna break up the family
Can't hold me, my vertical so pivot
Pressure it keeps building
Reaching but can't hit it
You hate, but we did it
You aimed and we hit it
Ballin with no limits
We ready, we all in it
The sky is my limit, how it feels to win
I could break down this rim, just put me in
It's the beast from the east, we the best from the west
I's the logo that I'm beating on my chest
It's not about you, it's not about me
It's all about the team, let me hear it on three
Now you can stop them, but you will never stop me
Got the crowd going wild for the MVP

10 seconds on the shot clock
4th quarter it's on me (it's on me)
See them haters try to run now
But I won't let em run up on my team (on my team)
Cause I'm a fanatic, yeah
Gotta go with em hustlin
Cause I'm a fanatic, yeah
And everybody can't deal with me

Fresh out of school, straight into the league
Number 1 draft pick, all eyes is on me (M-V-P)
I can hear em in the stands
I approach 5 now when the shot leave my hands
Let the fans go wild (Go hard or go home)
Block the shot
Eat the shot clock, so pass me the rock
You will not survive in my zone
Half-court shot all net then I'm gone

10 seconds on the shot clock
4th quarter it's on me (it's on me)
See them haters try to run now
But I won't let em run up on my team (on my team)
Cause I'm a fanatic, yeah
Gotta go with em hustlin
Cause I'm a fanatic, yeah
And everybody can't deal with me
