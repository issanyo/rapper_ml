"A Alkaholik, you know what I'm sayin" ("Likwidation" sample)

(Xzibit)
Yo it's Prime Time, only when the beats and the rhymes shine
All that other bullshit can move it to the sidelines
Whoever you are, wherever you at
You are now breakin your necks wit true underground vets
Yo it's Prime Time, only when the beats and the rhymes shine
All that other bullshit can move it to the sideline
Ladies and gentlemen, what we have for you
Mr. CaTashTraphe from the Likwit Crew

(Tash)
A lot of rappers fuck it up, CaTashTraphe'll fuck it down
I'm so hungry for the mic like we just gettin off the ground
But my style is at a national
Three albums in, you ask your friends about CaTash
They'll say "Tash can injure ninja"
The gunner, I walkin in ask about the spread
Bet against the Likwit Crew's the best way to lose your wig
Cuz I'm above y'all niggas heads, below y'all niggas knees
My style'll get you drunk till you can't say your "ABC's"
I get my write on, Nick at Nite wit my light on
Cuz goin plat-i-num is what my homies got they sight on
Cuz I been mega-tight on microphones since I was tethen
I may not look like I'm the deepest, but looks is deceivin
Cuz I be takin mines into Deep Space Nine
Wit a sip of brew for me and two sips for mankind
Cuz Tash got the style wit more soul than solid quartz
I got that big game, you might hear my name on EA Sports

(Xzibit)
Yo it's Prime Time, only when the beats and the rhymes shine
All that other bullshit, can move it to the sidelines
Whoever you are, wherever you at
You are now breakin your necks wit true underground vets
Yo it's Prime Time, only when the beats and the rhymes shine
*Flex starts cuttin*
All that other bullshit, can move it to the sidelines
Ladies and gentlemen what we have for you
*Flex blends into next song*
