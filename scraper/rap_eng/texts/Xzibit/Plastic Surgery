[Saafir:]
You have, scars in your mask like Seal
That ain't for real
We'll have to fix that, yo nigga, sit back

[Xzibit:]
Your flow remind me of a nigga that I just don't feel
Same style and delivery
Might as well have his grill
Pass the scapel, the alcohol, clamps
25 hundred get you style enhanced
It's like...

[Saafir:]
This, mask right here will lift your grill
It'll put height in your mack
Don't take to much off
If you want a nose like Michael Jackson

[Xzibit:]
If you want it done right, nigga come see this
Maybe even send your bitch
We can fix them tits
From a C-cup to a double D-cup
Make them big shits, doctor lick 'em, yeah

[Saafir:]
I like to, axe em, jack em for their financial
Need a facial, I'll change the skin tone to interracial
After I'm done, you might have a little pouch though
Nothin' my scaple can't fix
What kind of face you want
(I want the kind that make me look like I can rhyme)
It'll cost you
(But I can find the skrilla, if I can have that nigga face named Saafir!)
That's imposterous, plus I never cloned a microphone
What type of shit you on, I hope you got insurance
Before I sit you on my gurney
And lead you to an anesthetic breather
If you're not broke, I'll save your face like dope and make it right
Casue being fake ain't tight
You need plastic surgery

[Hook:]
I hear the same ole rhymes, the same ole style
(It seems you need plastic surgery) x5

[Xzibit:]
I'm located, at, the bottom of the black list
I like to malpractice, complicate a surgery
Intoxicated, smoke cigarettes, drop ashes in your open gases
Feel the utensil, knife is dull like a pencil
And what?
When a nigga play pussy, get fucked
Without a kiss or a hug, I'm like contaminated blood
Transfused from a junkie
With the heroin jones, I reconstruct the bones
Of all hip hop clones

[Ras Kass:]
I date fat girls that weigh 215
With low self esteem, cause it's easier to get the pussy
I'm performing vinyl liposuctions
(Fat MC?)
Phat production, motherfuckin' facial reconstruction
Needles injected 33 RPM of anesthetic for actors who require cosmetic
Sex changes from bitch niggas to rah-rah niggas
The only cure for sick lyrics is to implant a hit gimmick

[Saafir:]
This shit is full blown, you better head to the clinic
After Captain Save-A-Ho, we had the sex lieutenant
Operate get straight, we here to separate the fake from the classic
Niggas get blasted if they plastic

[Hook]

[Ras Kass:]
I'm like Dougie Howser M.D with a desert eagle
Criminal Genius
Operation, separatin' them siamese twins hangin' beneath them niggas' penis
Take it to your face like a skin graft
Rappers, I specialize in talent transplants
You want fat lips nurse get the collagen
And ten tons of stomach pumps from all the cum you and Richard Gere be
Swallowin'
Now followin' ask Vanna to buy you vowels
So you can see I, aye, E-Swift, oh, you know why
We remain uncontested to the contender, we can
Million Man March all the way to December
January, Feburary 28th

[Saafir:]
I never wash my hands
The only rubber gloves I wear is on my dick
But I'll split you quick
Got hands like Jackie Chan, the way I switch my wrists and
I make ya sick, but I'm a doctor, don't trip
Hopefully, in surgery, I won't slip
On a tile that file and twist ya lips
Like Gomer Pyle
Prescriptions I'm over-ripe
For the ones thats overbitin' on dental records
Bitin', to God, send your blessings
I'll put your mask on, fast like Ramadan
Mix them bitches like half Lola Falana, half blonde in the paper, they named me
A Large Professor, a Mad Scientist, with a long line of clients
(BITCH! GET OUT OF MY OFFICE)
You don't have an appointment or an application
For me to attack your face in my practice
Never lackin' when I'm inserting these plastic patches
Seems like you need plastic surgery
