[Adil Omar]

Off the handle, I'm the raw example of a cyborg
Psych ward music, get strangled by the mic cord
Time warp; future isn't safe for you tricks
Struggle made me persevere but turned you into a bitch
It's verbal manslaughter, we stuck in traffic
You bitches honking horns while I turn this fucking ride into a Transformer
A damn problem and you wonder why I'm cocky
Cause I stay burning, hotter than a summer in Karachi

[Xzibit]

This is what we all about, scream and let you get it out
Fuck your fucking bank account, we ghetto trynna make it out
Of the ghetto with devil red, or Carolina blue
Then California where you from, who the fuck is you?
I came to bring the essence, seem like the essence left us
With no protection or recollection of our possessions
Witness the exodus, this is a migration
The numbers all match it, watch the women gyrating


[Hook: Adil Omar and Xzibit]

Now I got 'em like "Hey"
Hey, we don't play
I said can't nobody hold me down

It's like "Hey"
Hey, we don't play
I said can't nobody hold me down

It's like "Hey"
Hey, we don't play
I said can't nobody hold me down

Islamabad, (get up!)
LA, (get up!)
Can't nobody hold me down


[Xzibit]

Why you waiting for it, to hop in my shit and floor it
Fifty foot tall gorilla, never to be ignored
Hallelujah, praise the lord, living by the sword
Never looking back, I'm too busy paying forward in life
Cause money ain't shit when your health ain't right
I bet I won't miss when you're in my sight
Witness the exodus, this is a migration
The numbers all match it, watch the women gyrating

[Adil Omar]

Yo, we playing Grand Theft Auto, without the console
Watch you and your man get caught up inside a plot hole
We rock shows like warriors; blast first
Energy like M.O.P inside a black church
(Hey) - Fredwreck bringing the bass
We throw a Molotov cocktail into the place
Feel the boom, cause I'm hip-hop's Shahid Afridi
At your fashion show; you're missing all your models


[Hook: Adil Omar and Xzibit]

Now I got 'em like "Hey"
Hey, we don't play
I said can't nobody hold me down

It's like "Hey"
Hey, we don't play
I said can't nobody hold me down

It's like "Hey"
Hey, we don't play
I said can't nobody hold me down

Islamabad, (get up!)
LA, (get up!)
Can't nobody hold me down


[Bridge: Adil Omar]

You don't wanna front when I'm off the ground
Seeing that you really couldn't hold me down
Bangin' to the beat, going on and on
I'm flying off the handle, flying off it now

So many dogs wanna bark the bark
But you know that I'm already off the wall
Bangin' to the beat, going on and on
I'm flying off the handle


[Hook: Adil Omar and Xzibit]

Now I got 'em like "Hey"
Hey, we don't play
I said can't nobody hold me down

It's like "Hey"
Hey, we don't play
I said can't nobody hold me down

It's like "Hey"
Hey, we don't play
I said can't nobody hold me down

Islamabad, (get up!)
LA, (get up!)
Can't nobody hold me down
