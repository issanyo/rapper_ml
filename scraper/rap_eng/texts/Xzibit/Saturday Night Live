[Intro]
Ahhh! We bout to go this motherfuckin club tonight, y'knahmean?
Poke some motherfuckin hoes, y'knahmean?
Make sure them hoes, y'knahmean? Gon' act accordingly, y'knahmean?
Some nigga over there tryin to love one hoe
Y'knahmean? You got one hoe!
Nigga youse a stone motherfuckin Jackson
Nigga youse a stony Jackson, you can't fuck with us
So nigga, tuck your tail and hide your hoe nigga

[Jelly Roll]
We parked our rides, in front of club
All these niggas started givin us love
Sayin I'm the shit, Xzibit you the shit
Jelly Roll get 'em, can I be for real?
It's Strong Arm and Jelly Roll, cool for real
Yeah motherfucker, why don't you just chill
Cause I'm just coolin at the spot
Ain't much wrong plus you're makin it hot
I like shinin from all the grindin
Girl's best friend, man I'm just like diamonds
I like khakis and Air Force Ones
Gangsters in the hood with them air force guns
We poppin them tags, our pockets fat
We fin' to put the world in a shopping bag
Nigga X the man, and I'm the man
We tryin to make you love it, don't you understand?

[Chorus]
If you're with Strong Arm, you're really down with us
If you get high, then get a blunt and roll it up
Your hood's gon' ride, then let me see you throw it up
If you ready I'm ready see really we don't give a fuck
Get'cha ass up if you're really down with us
Girl you ain't cute, get on the floor and move your butt
The bar is open everybody's gettin drunk
If you're ready I'm ready see really we don't give a fuck

[Xzibit]
Another night in L.A., the homies all valet
We got it lookin the dub show in front of the place
Strong Arm + 75, we so deep we arrive
And then we swarm like you fucked with the hive
Gotta look a nigga right in the eyes, to tell the truth and the lies
Even the strong find it hard to survive
Another day another dollar we can walk on water
Better, drop your tone, you ain't nobody's father
Hotter than about a buck shot your carne asada
X burn down the town like a path of lava
Pathological drama so we got it inside
Is it the wine or the women it's so hard to decide
Look alive it's crackin; this is organized street hustlin
With corporate backin promotin interstate traffic (traffic)
Classic, smash out right
Cause live from Los Angeles it's Saturday Night

[Interlude]
Cause I, can get yo' ass on the floor
Cause this, is this the funk that you want?
The hand, it comes way up in the air
And wave 'em all around like you just don't caaaaaaaaare
Bitch, come off of those pots
Stop, shake that junk in your trunk
See you, can move this groovyville shit
The shake that makes the whollllle club flip

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
You might get shot in the face if you don't stay in your place
You ain't a soldier like me you a fuckin disgrace
X move like a shark in the water, I'm dodgin death and disorder
I'll get you hit it won't cost me a quarter
I was sent here to strangle and slaughter in no particular order
Your big mouth might endanger your daughter
Another day another digit I'ma speak it and live it
Better get yourself a gun 'fore you fuck with Xzibit
Pockets shorter than a midget, you can fuckin forget it
X green light the target and easily hit it
Grab the zone and split it so we smokin them woods
Steady givin niggas the business and keepin it hood
Firearms we packin, this is military mindstate
That's ready for action we mercenaries and assassins (blastin)
Clashin, smash out right
Cause live from Los Angeles it's Saturday Night

[Jelly Roll]
Let's hit the club and get it on tonight
Let's get drunk this is Saturday Night
Just got paid, shine my chrome up tight
Time to get it crackin, off the Henn' tonight
X is here, the gang is here
Jelly Roll production bangin crystal clear
I've been low, now check my highs
Million dollar niggas right before yo' eyes

[Xzibit]
In Los Angeles, homey (it's Saturday Night)
In Houston, dogg (it's Saturday Night)
In Miami, mate (it's Saturday Night)
In Atlanta, shorty (it's Saturday Night)
In St. Louis, dirty (it's Saturday Night)
In New Orleans wodie, yo (it's Saturday Night)
In New York City, yo (it's Saturday Night)
Around the world baby, yo (it's Saturday Night)

[Outro]
On some straight motherfuckin pimpin shit, y'knahmean?
