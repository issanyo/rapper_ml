[Hook]
I'm Sick And Tired Of Being Stuck In The Same Route
I Got A Date With Myself And We Blowing My Brains Out
That's Probably Why I Can't Hang Out
Then Cause If I Hang Out I Might Miss Blowing My Brains Out
La La La La   La La La La  La La La La
That's The Song We Sing Right Before We Go
Here To Start The Show Here To Let You Know
That I'm The Third Shooter From The Grassy Knoll
Now Check The Flow
[Verse 1]
Now We're Doing Some Shots And We're Calling Some Shots
And You Tell Your Life Story With A Twisted Plot
Well If You Had Two Heads You Would Have Two Names
Blow Out Both My Brains Right Out The Frame
Writing Suicide Notes
Deep In The Sand  Your Cutting And Frying Your Wrist To Your Favorite Band
Kicking Some Snot And Your Wiping Some Beer Boogs (?)
How About A Day To Pro Create
Hold Up Your Wrist And Be On Some Shit
Check Back Your Email On Your Cell Phone
Blow Out Your Brains And Your Clavicle Drains
Bathroom Date With The Toaster
Never Had A Fever Like This
Twitter Yourself It Feels So Good
La La La La La La
To Buy My Meals At Dead Man's Parties C.A. All Day

[Verse 2]
Look At My Brain Matter See My Thoughts
Your Doing Some Beer Runs From The Laptop
Naked Girls Giving You Back Talk
And Learn How To Skate And Write On The Wall
Spit On The Stage And Scratching My Balls
Holding My Hand When You Walk At The Mall
Ringtone Battles Your Ringtone
Look At All This Mortgage Money I Bring Home
Look At The Fish In The Glass (?)
Kissing Yourself While Your Kissing My Ass
And Bull Dikes With There Big Biker Boyfriends
Wear Your Collar (Yeah) For Me And To Be Him (?)
Hold This Bone Your Doing Some Dirt
Blow Out Your Brains Until The Shits Squirts
You Same Something Do It Sharp
Kill My Health Until You Stop My Heart

(Xzibit) [Verse 3]
Big Blunts Lit Up Hit Up Time To Get It On
Never See Me Going Back And Forth Like A Metronome
Break And Break And Breaking Down Till The Break Of Dawn
We Don't Drink Till Buzzed We Drink Till We Drink It All
You Ain't Come With Me What The Fuck Is You Tripping On
You Ain't Got To Leave Just Because All The Liquor Gone
Don't Want To Have To Go Half On A Baby
I  Want To Fuck You All In My Mercedes Crazy
You Got A Lazy Eye I Still Think Your Cute
Now Come And Give It To Me Quick Like A Prostitute
I'm Fresh Out Of Loot I Want To Take You Out
Want You To Juggle These Motherfuckers Inside Your Mouth
We Need To Stop A Circle K From Funk Sway (?)
We Do This All Day Give A Damn What You Say
The Salt To The Earth Assault You Always
I Never Went To Class I Rocked The Hallways
I'm Sick And Tired Of Being Stuck In The Same Route
I Got A Date With Myself And We Blowing My Brains Out
That's Probably Why I Can't Hang Out
Then Cause If I Hang Out I Might Miss Blowing My Brains Out
