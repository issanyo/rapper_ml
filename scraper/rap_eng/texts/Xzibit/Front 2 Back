[Bridge]
Oh no, let's get drunk and fuck fo' sho'
Please stop runnin yo' mouth let's go
Actin like you've never seen a dick befo'
All these bitches in here

[Xzibit]
Will the real X to the Z please stand up?
With my niggas and my guns, not givin a fuck
Stickin 'em up at point blank range
They say the more things change, they stayin the same
I can't complain
Type of shit that make you wish you was dead
Make you bite the curb, and stomp down on the back of your head
Blow it out like a afro pick
Attract bitches like flies to shit
Pop pills and ride the dick
Niggas can't swing this quick, I'm Dark McGwire
Bangin shit over the fence with Rockwilder
Listen, niggas do anything for a dollar, even
Killin they own, let it be known, it's like

[Hook]
It ain't safe where I'm from
Niggas start beef never knowin the outcome
Rather be caught with it than caught without one
Leave it alone because the life that you save might be your own
It ain't safe where I'm from
Niggas start beef never knowin the outcome
Rather be caught with it than caught without one
Leave it alone because the life that you save might be your own

[Verse 2]
I'm pullin pistols if you don't break bread
Mr. Wrong Side of the Bed, only get excited for head
Now print this in your industry books
If it wasn't for crooks you niggas'd still sport the Jordache look
Hit the switch, front to back, side to side
Natural born killers never let shit slide
Never rely on the next man to swing for you
A rock and a hard place, duck between the two
And y'all bitches just somethin to do, don't get it twisted
You're easy like Sunday mornin and shopliftin
It go simple as that, I'm never givin half to a rat
I'd rather bam to your face with a bat
You get tied down to the tracks
Used to make a living cookin coke to crack, now I can't turn back
This is holocaust rap nigga, overreact
And I'mma bring to yo' chest like an asthma attack, ya heard?

[Hook]
It ain't safe where I'm from
Niggas start beef never knowin the outcome
Rather be caught with it than caught without one
Leave it alone because the life that you save might be your own
It ain't safe where I'm from
Niggas start beef never knowin the outcome
Rather be caught with it than caught without one
Leave it alone because the life that you save might be your own

[Bridge]
Oh no, X get drunk and fuck fo' sho'
Please stop runnin yo' mouth let's go
Actin like you've never seen a dick befo'
All these bitches in here
