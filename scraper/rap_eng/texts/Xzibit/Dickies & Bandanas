[Intro: Xzibit]
New West, Old West
No, its just West

[Hook: Xzibit]
Dickies, Dickies and, Dickies and

Dickies, Dickies and, Dickies and
Dickies and bandanas
Yeah, I'm just calling it how I see it
Where you get that from?
Yeah, be about it if you gon be it
Where You get that from?

[Verse 1: Demrick]
Too many cooks in the kitchen, way too much lying and bitching
How did you gain that position, I have your family sniffling
You should actually listen, Before you answer the question
Niggas dying for less than, giving the wrong impression
You like a signed confession, we got it all on paper
Paramedics all on faders, there's no way to contain us
You think its all entertainment, and it should end with the music
Don't be foolish, we from the ghetto, niggas liable to lose it
I'm from the land of the prove-it, if you're bout it then do it
All the drugs we be using'll have you having illusions
Where you get your style from? I guess we'll reintroduce it
We be moving like a movement you have nothing to do with
We providing sollutions, so which side is you choosing?
Here's your bandana and hammer, if they panic then shoot em
Its as simple as that, cause gangsta rapper reacts
We strike like a match and watch your infrastructure collapse
I'm in my

Where You get that from?
Dickies, Dickies and, Dickies and
Dickies and bandanas
Dickies, Dickies and, Dickies and
Dickies and bandanas
Yeah, lowriders, ?-riders with kits
Where you get that from?
Heavy-handed, hard than a bitch
Where you get that from?

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Have you ever seen a maniac in all black?
Khaki suit, allocute, parking lot, pop and shoot
No witnesses witness this, black khaki suit
Bandana, Komanwel? scanner and a bandana
Tied around a handle and a clip, click, bandana
Tied around the banana clip, get clipped and ran up
On your homies like "What it is?" the last man standing
You know who I am: I'm Gotti, the last man standing
With a cannon, picture it like a Canon camera
On the block like hood, I'm in motion, rollercoasting
Westcoasting for nothing, approach them and body roast them
Chuck's not giving a fuck, socking the niggas closest
What's happening homie? Is that right?
You the one to stand up for your hood tonight?
You the one that's gonna make wrong the right?
Instantaneously we take flight
Ain;t nothing can be better, there's nothing worse
The homies won't take off unless I take off first
Disperse, experts on work that works to lay niggas down
Like wax and exerts and spurts, motherfucker we in

[Verse 3: B-Real]
I'm spitting venom, the critics I end them, you can lend them
Your heart, but there's no way to stop me once I'm gaining momentum
I'm elevated, my weapon is calibrated
I'm hated by haters who hated because they never made it
I'm validated by those, who sat and waited
For yours truly, foolishly thinking that you debated my flows
Calculated, evaluated, but still you never know
How we manage to murder the microphone, man I'm in the zone
Competition is none, I'm on this mission so run
Overshadowed you fuckers cause I'm eclipsing the Sun
Don't try to lift up your gun, no need to be dumb
Jury is hung, I'm killing you fucking busters for fun
That's how we get it done, method is flawless and some of you saw this coming
[?] are humming in the city, bitches are bumming
I'm the thief in the night, right
Your blinded by the light, tight
Taking it light, you don't get out my sight
I'm in my
