[Intro: Skit]
Judge: Alright, your charged with public intoxication. Alright, listen
Convict: There's a thousand people out who're drunk
Judge: Okay, I understand that

[Chorus: J-Ro]
We O-W-N the whole zone
The Likwit Crew is on the microphone
Let it rain, brother
Let it rain, brother
Let it rain, brother
Xzibit do your thing

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
You get permanently put on your ass like Teddy Pendergrass
Whenever you trespass on Alkaholik territory (yeah, Yeah)
More savage than any rapper on your roster
I regulate, extortin' on ya R&B label mate (give it up)
Xzibit rates the state, cross me is costly
Fuck jiggy and flossy, I'm tryin' to keep the government off my small dick (yeah)
Dodgin' hard time and house arrest
What do you expect, findin' what ya never forget
'Cause you're sellin' wolf tickets that your ass can't pay
What I display, skill last found in Cassius Clay
In this prime time, hustle for mine
Used to nickel and dime
Doin' felony crime, but now I bust mine
Instead of bustin' at enemies when the sun go down
Me and my niggas with a fat one
Smoke 'em all down to nothing
Crushin' rappers, bare Witness like Jehovah
Swore we haven't been sober since 21 and over

[Chorus: Xzibit]
We O-W-N the whole zone
Likwit Crew is on the microphone
Let it rain brother
Let it rain brother
Let it rain brother
Let it rain brother
We O-W-N the whole zone
Likwit Crew is on the microphone
Let it rain brother
Let it rain brother
Let it rain
King Tee do your thing

[Verse 2: King Tee]
When the Likwit hits my soul
I get conceptions to make the microphones explode
The drunk mode, sippin' X-O from the straw
King Tee broadcaster raw
Optical intoxication, flood your video station
Scramblin' any playahation
But some of these fools got chips in they boxes
So I blocks it, pull they whole set out the socket
Tha Alkaholiks rock shit
Any which way, man, I got shit
The Alkaholik don, king from Babylon
With some fatal shock shit
In this district, I'm listed as the mystic majestic, I gets hectic
What you expect, shit? The Likwit comity
Believe me loc, things will get shitty
Ain't gon' look pretty
Comin' from the Likwidation squad
Smoke weed, drink hard, my God

[Chorus: Xzibit]
We O-W-N the whole zone
Likwit Crew is on the microphone
Let it rain brother
Let it rain brother
Let it rain brother
Let it rain brother
We O-W-N the whole zone
Likwit Crew is on the microphone
Let it rain brother
Let it rain brother
Let it rain
J-Ro do your thing

[Verse 3: J-Ro]
Fuck that East-West mess
I'm gettin' rest last (ha)
We make the crowd say, "Yes, yes"
Faster than the SS (woo)
Impala, you got beef than holla (yeah)
My crew sticks together like Richy and Dollar
We got the boom-boom claats, shakey like Don Knots (ayy, mind)
They bitin' like a room full of pits and rots
I got that old school soul
Called take it back like repo
And I got foes on my shelf like homes T-Paul
I'm C-Bo, that's my homeboy Rico
Posted up with three French broads at the need bowl
I got ass with the speed of a cheetah, finished up my two liter
Hopped in my 2-seater (yeah)
Sunshine, drivin' down fine
Bumpin 103.9
They playin' ooh, so fine (aight)
Got 'em on the fifth floor
Knocked on the door
Xzibit's in the house and he brought three more

[Interlude]
What the fuck is goin' on in here (what's up, my nigga?)
What's happenin'
Where we drinkin' at?
These my homegirls right here (wassup? Hey boys)
What y'all drinkin' right now (some strawberry daiquiri)
Fuck that, all we got is Hennessy

[Chorus: Xzibit]
We O-W-N the whole zone
Likwit Crew is on the microphone
Let it rain brother
Let it rain brother
Let it rain
Rico do your thing

[Verse 4: Rico]
And up next, we got the Likwitest
It's so drunk, it's ridiculous (hold up)
When Tash got the mic
I swing my shit like Jack Nicklaus (yeah)
I'm spinnin' this for niggas that slept on Likwidation
'Cause no matter where you go (uh-huh)
They know the reputation
CaTashtrophe I punk lyrics with spunk
I'm like the renegade of funk
That get that bumstick krunk (say what?)
So if you watch your ship sunkin'
Fuck you with the drunken
Then come a little closer
Let me hand you somethin' (say what?)
I bomb with a wig blowin' up your click
Now take your pick, you can kiss my ass or suck my dick (what? Ha)
'Cause this is how we comin' in 1998
The Alkaholiks, X, and King Tee the great
