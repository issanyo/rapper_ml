[Verse 1: Xzibit]
Get down, turn around, show me what you got
You a pow-pow, Juggernaut, take it up a notch
Oh my god, wow, take 'em out, let me take a shot
I'mma sit down, get a drink, let you work it out
Step back, I can nearly put it in your mouth
Have a cocktail, never fail, turn your body out
We can set sail, overseas, you cannot pronounce
All the places you will see, currency amounts
Fluctuating, better learn, quickly how to count
We can pass out, wake up, make another drop
Got a pornstar appetite, get it while it's hot
How you ticking like a clock, tie your panties in a knot
Let me crush that, rush that, let me come again
It's a must that I touch that, where do I begin?
In the back? In the front? Damn, show me what it is
Fast lane, with a fast dame, only way to live

[Hook x2]
Strip down, turn around
Show me what it is
Strip down, turn around
Show me what it is
Strip down, turn around
Show me what it is
Show me what it is
Show me what it is

[Verse 2: Young De]
You a bad chick, you deserve every single dollar
And your assets make me wanna come and do the honors
Forecast says, you gon' have some money raining on you
With the chance that it's gonna last all the way until tomorrow
Cash-in, go and put a price tag on it
Cause your ass, I could probably fit a mic stand on it
Refrigerator, or mattress and a nightstand on it
Make a nigga wanna go take a loan, finna own it
You flaunt it, can't lie about that
When you're lying down flat and you're arching up your back
Crazy, face, crazy, taste, crazy, I save you
Practice making babies, maybe
I'm getting a lil' ahead of myself
But I know I put it down better than anyone else, does
But this ain't about love, this about
Two pills, a bottle of champagne and a hot tub

[Hook x2]
Strip down, turn around
Show me what it is
Strip down, turn around
Show me what it is
Strip down, turn around
Show me what it is
Show me what it is
Show me what it is
