Killin' It
[Tash]
Ahh, ahh
I be killin it (why Tash?) cause I be feelin it
I get money so no need for stealin it
I work diligent beneath the Earth's soil
Where I write rhymes so fresh it's like I wrapped my styles in foil
But I sit at home and boil spicy rum when it's freezing
Cause I from the Likwid crew where we got drinks for every season
Maybe that's the reason why I live high all July
And the place I buy my beer is callin in for more supply
Maybe not, maybe so, maybe yes, maybe no
Maybe niggas got some friends that wanna battle for some dough
If you know somebody holla, cause I take those extra dollars
Split that shit with J and Swift, buy a ninety-six Impala
And lace it with the deez out my own stack of cheese
Get a extra flossy floss and toss King Tee the keys
And say, 'Nigga that's yours, cause you opened up doors
Before Tha Liks had a deal, you had a nigga on tour
So God bless ya, never let this rap pressure test ya
You know who got your back when them other niggas sweat ya'
So check uno dos while I roast this coast a toast
When it comes to beats and rhymes, you know who got the most
I be killin it (killin it) killin it (killin it)
Tha Liks rock that shit that have all ya niggas feelin it
Killin it (killin it) killin it (killin it)
J-Ro is up next to flow
[J-Ro]
Dat's me
I be killin it (killin it) when I be feelin it
Got rum in my cup, best believe I won't be spillin it
Yo Xzibit (whattup Ro) I got to know
Do I got that Likwid flow (oh fo' sho') well here I go
Mida, mida, down the barrel of my heater
I torch ya, then skeet out in my Porsche two-seater
I'm from the home of rattlesnakes and golden bears
And Astro-vans with swivel chairs hoes come in pairs
Plus, makin money's in my genes
That's why I got money in my jeans, I got a cravin
My mind craves the knowledge, my pockets crave the cash
My mouth craves the brew, and my Johnson craves the ass
Who's on blast, Tha Liks baby, don't twist it
Just rock it, got your girl's number in my change pocket
What's her name Stella, if she's on me kinda hella
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi? is what I tell her
I get freaky like Friday, why dey, try to get loose
Wack MC's are like ?brown guts?, they have no use
I just got off the court, where I was whoopin some cats
In basketball, here's a question that I have to ask y'all
Who be killin it, is it the ladies?
Who be killin it, is it the fellas?
Who be killin it, is it the b-boys?
Who be killin it, is it the gangsters?
Who be killin it, is it the rastas?
Who be killin it, killin it, killin it, killin it...
[Xzibit]
See I be killin it, yeah, when I be feelin it
This is dedicated to the niggas that be stealin shit
Straight from the bottom of my black-ass heart
The untamed feel no shame, on top of the game
Mr. Big Bad Insane, black John McClane
Look listen and learn, you only get what you earn
So I'ma hustle like fuck regardless, watch my smoke
Go straight for the throat, we known for rockin the boat
It's hard to find like the grade A shit, with no cuts
Tryin to stack like King Tut, and still bang the microphone up
Demandin, clear lane for crash landin
If anything I'm guaranteed to be the Last Man Standing
Pick a number motherfucker whassup?
The circumstance make you shit in your pants, and we advance
As an avalanche of soul, and everything that shine ain't gold
Just cause niggas got brew don't make em nickel proof
My record contract reads hit man for hire
Xzibit showin grace under fire
Tha Alkaholiks killin it (killin it) killin it (killin it)
[Tash] Tha Liks rock that shit that have all y'all niggas feelin it
[Xzibit]
Once again, feelin it
Killin it (killin it) drillin it (drillin it)
What, yeah, bring it live with the... yeah
Feelin it (feelin it) killin it (killin it)
Like this
[Tash] Party down, party down, party down!
[Xzibit] Bringin it live once again, yeah, cause I be killin it
(What, stabbin it, beatin it, yeah)
[Tash] Y'all niggas ain't heard no shit like this out the West coast
[J-Ro] Say what, wha-what, wha-what what?
I say what, wha-what, wha-what what? It's the likwid crew
[Tash] We be killin it, uhh, cause we be feelin it...
[J-Ro] Say what, say what, say what wha-what wha-what what?
