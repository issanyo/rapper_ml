[INTRO: Xzibit]
A ha (ladies and gentlemen)
Yeah, sit back and smoke a fat one.  Yeah, pronto.  Look from Los Angeles
To Toronto.  It's X to the Z, Xzibit.  Yeah, my dog Saukrates, spittin' at
'em.  Yeah, like a automatic philly

[Saukrates]
Yo, revolutionary, evolutionary
Bulldozer, leave y'all with troops to bury
Clean sweep if ya smell fear in these mean streets
It's instinct, life's a b____ and she's far from cheap
I got love for my dogs hustling for defeats
Put it down for this paper, increase the real
Come wit it, run wit it, f___ wit it
Big Sauk to shock your mind and your spirits
Taste these lyrics while I spit truth on tape
Whether two inch, a DAT, or D-A-T-A
I impregnate WAX, so get mine regardless
Of anybody's set, I'm starving the artist
Who's next to me? It's the X to Z
Together we bomb MCs with text debris
Leaving y'all hard pressed to breath
Other words, n____ show love and chicks spit the ecstasy
How real is that?

CHORUS [Xzibit] {Saukrates}
X to Z {keep it movin', movin')
Saukrates {keep it going, going like that y'all}
Liquid MCs baby {ha, I keep it moving and moving}
{Keep it going, going, like that y'all}

[Xzibit]
See I punch beater it in fear, ask him if he's had enough
Tan khakis, T-shirt, wife beater tatted up
Looking for props
How you explain to n_____ drinking beer to the bottom that they can't come
Up
F___ ????, say what?
Stack loot so much, reach out and touch you probably die from the paper
Cuts
I see you lazy f___, sceming on the speed demon
Keep on dreaming, give me any type of reason
To stop your breathing, yeah it's mee against the world
'Cause the eyes deceiving wide like a jet ski
Me and _____ a hard stick like Wayne Gretzky
Look I try to live where the Lolos and the sets be
I still roll dolo, let a normal n____ test me
I let you have it in the face trying to waste me
Your homies can't face me 'cause they scared for their own safety

CHORUS [Xzibit] {Saukrates}
X to Z {keep it movin', movin')
Saukrates {keep it going, going like that y'all}
Liquid MCs baby {ha, I keep it moving and moving}
{Keep it going, going, like that y'all}
{Feel the RUSH} yeah, feel it
{Feel the adrenaline *echoed*}
Feel the rush, feel the adrenaline

[Saukrates]
Yo, take that, take that, n____ stay back
With that fake rap, break that 'fore cats react
To your shallow ass isht, go practice
Saukrates never making wack isht, trust me son
If I'm eating, my dogs eating
Use experience for teaching without preaching
Each, and everyday I be thinking about my future
Preparing for the new world we ain't used to
Handle that, with supreme caution
Peep this mental distortion
Feeding you with grips of funk by the portions
Contort into killers could lead to abortion
Face down in a closed coffin, WHAT!

CHORUS [Xzibit] {Saukrates}
X to Z {keep it movin', movin')
Saukrates {keep it going, going like that y'all}
Liquid MCs baby {ha, I keep it moving and moving}
{Keep it going, going, like that y'all}
Yo, keep it movin' and movin, keep it going and going like that y'all

[OUTRO: Xzibit]
This is how we do mad dawg.  Ha ha ha ha.  Yeah, pronto from here to
Toronto.  X to the Z, Saukrates, liquid MCs baby.  So, keep it moving
