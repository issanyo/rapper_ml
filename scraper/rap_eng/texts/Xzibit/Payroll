[Intro: Hakeem]
Empire!

[Verse 1: Hakeem and Blake]
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to set it straight
I make this paper, yeah, come to me, I never chase
Hakeem the one to beat, get at my rank
I'm laughing at all the joker, all the way to the bank
'Cause I got money to blow, the closest you got is a candle
Make a wish on the low, so you can be half as dope as a snatch and flow
It's in my blood
Cracking these styles is in my sleep, yeah you know
Run it to the bank right

[Bridge: Both]
Ain't got no worries
I get this money (I got it!)
Pockets heavy and I'm going crazy
Yeah, get with these honies
Get more than Brody (I got 'em)
Drop 'em quick, yeah I'm running

[Hook]
Run it, Run it, Run it, Run it
Run it, Run it, run it to the bank 'cause I'm
Stuntin', Stuntin', Stuntin', Stuntin'
Stuntin', Stuntin', got to get my ice tight

[Verse 2: Blake and Hakeem]
You can't touch me, or you gon' get burned
I'm too hot, make a fire look like an intern
Ain't a liar, it's best you make a U-turn
'Cause our flame getting in their feelings like heartburn
Stuck out like a sore thumb
Been in these streets, thugging out for my income (They didn't believe me)
Ain't no daddy to hold me down, but the kid dumb
Mama told me to pray, get all your dreams done, yeah
Cocky, they call me Rocky, champion yeah
I'm too high, just too fly, got me light in the air
Never hear my moves, I'm so silent in scares
When I'm silent with my feet, trying to put two in jet
Faithfully get this money, my hood never leave me lonely
Tattooed on my back, yeah, I take 'em to where I'm going
The top is the only place that I'm living at
I go hard for my city forever, running to the bank like

[Bridge: Both]
Ain't got no worries
I get this money
Pockets heavy and I'm going crazy
Yeah, get with these honies
Get more than Brody
Drop 'em quick, yeah I'm running

[Hook]
Run it, Run it, Run it, Run it
Run it, Run it, run it to the bank 'cause I'm
Stuntin', Stuntin', Stuntin', Stuntin'
Stuntin', Stuntin', got to get my ice tight

[Verse 3: Shyne]
I step over the threat
Papa New Guinea, head hunter, Russian roulette
I'm Phillip Morris and Chuck Norris, and King Tut
You rolling with the kids with the keys to the kingdom
Freedom
We do whatever we want, we got it
While you sitting in silence like Twenty-One Pilots
I'm addicted to violence
We should form an alliance
And call it Serial Killer
Cartel capitalism
Send Shyne to get 'em, commit 'em to the psych ward
They crazy, acting like they want war
The 80's is back when it come to that, broad daylight
This ain't no Call of Duty, no regenerated life
Incinerate a body, then I hide it in plain sight
I make the city riot, I can give it the green light
'Cause I'm just getting started
'Cause everything starts in the heart of the artist, for my dearly departed
