[Chorus]
See I can break it down like whatever you want
However you won't, forever you won't
Well you see I can break it down like whatever you want
*Organically manufactured to rattle your trunk*
See I can break it down like whatever you want
However you want, forever you won't
Well you see I can break it down like whatever you want
*Rat pack, dope sack rumblin' thump*
[Xzibit]
Let me drop a couple lines about X
Rushin' to the dirt this is all about work (huh)
Adjust whatever you bumpin' to proper volume
Houston-Houston-Houston... we have a problem
I-I-I'ma break it down like however you want
Organically manufactured to rattle your trunk
You's a rat pack, dope sack rumblin' thump
Staying alive, survive - Los Angeles Times
Drop-drop-drop-dropping dimes for protection ain't the sh*t
Your word is your worth fu*k a glorified snitch
Hit-hit-hit it hard when Eazy-E was alive
Form an organization we enterprise
Look into my eyes, listen to the truth
Stop looking for weed when you need to find the roots
It's kind of hard to rally behind the troops
When it's like the troops in my neighborhood too
Shoot-shoot-shootin' people and people apply pressure
Cap-cap-capital murder and no lesser
The economy continues to fail and break down
Watchin' CNN like Apocalypse Now (When it's on)

[Chorus]
See I can break it down like whatever you want
However you won't, forever you won't
Well you see I can break it down like whatever you want
*Organically manufactured to rattle your trunk*
See I can break it down like whatever you want
However you want, forever you won't
Well you see I can break it down like whatever you want
*Rat pack, dope sack rumblin' thump*
[Xzibit]
I had my back up against the wall
Never no nothing ever gon' stop me from standing tall
Ain't no classification for how I ball
You ain't never gon' ball 'cuz you afraid to crawl
You know you gotta crawl, before you learn to walk
After you learn to walk, then you began to talk
Talk sh*t, you better be able to back it up
Niggas ain't impressed homie because you tatted up
I'm the future, this is how we do it, do it, do it
When we smoke, ski mask with a ransom note
I don't pass my sack, I don't pass no dope
Get live socked down right in front of a crowd
Get down with the movement, operation Hutch
'Cuz you niggas on the Mic is outta touch
The family structure has broken all the way down
Watchin' CNN like Apocalypse Now (When it's on)

[Chorus]
See I can break it down like whatever you want
However you won't, forever you won't
Well you see I can break it down like whatever you want
*Organically manufactured to rattle your trunk*
See I can break it down like whatever you want
However you want, forever you won't
Well you see I can break it down like whatever you want
*Rat pack, dope sack rumblin' thump*
[Jelly Roll]
(Jelly!)
Seems like the whole world's gone crazy
Metal in the right hand scared for my babies
Won't accept no "if, and's or maybe's"
If it's not a sure thang you don't need to know me
Step live when you walk where I walk
Don't talk to loud 'cuz you might get stomped
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's, Aston Martin's Drophead
The Feds sniff around like they droppin' 'em off here
J-to-the-E-double L-Y rollin'
Heavy [?] leave your snot box swollen
I can break it down like however you need me
From the block to the tv, forever you see Jelly
[?] like the military, I'll bomb you from long range
I'm stackin' the millies man you dealing with small change
I'm grippin' my woodgrain with my little hood [?]
She love how I talk slang and live in the fast lane (come on)
Seems like the world's going crazy
Metal in my right hand scared for my babies
Won't accept no "if, and's or maybe's"
If it's not a sure thang you don't need to know me

[Chorus]
See I can break it down like whatever you want
However you won't, forever you won't
Well you see I can break it down like whatever you want
*Organically manufactured to rattle your trunk*
See I can break it down like whatever you want
However you want, forever you won't
Well you see I can break it down like whatever you want
*Rat pack, dope sack rumblin' thump*
