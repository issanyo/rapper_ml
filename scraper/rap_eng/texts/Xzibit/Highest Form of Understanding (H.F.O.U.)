[Intro: Xzibit]
Yeah, the first night I spent in California
I was homeless on Venice Beach, yeah

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
It was all a dream
Came to California at seventeen
Little nigga tryna bubble up from the crack scene
It got so complicated, then I graduated
Haters so mad I made it
How could I fly so high, only to feel so low?
How do they live so fast only to grow so slow?
Like when you showing no support for your kids
But got money for marijuana just to smoke with your friends
Or that woman who survives and beats cancer
Only to be drowned in debt with no answers
The frequency of tragedy, it happens so rapidly
That we became numb, we embraced this insanity
Some wack-job haul off and smoke his whole family
Reality T.V. that's not based in reality
Stuck watching train wrecks, everybody going for self
Self worth is important but for money and wealth
This mentality of "me, fuck everything else"
It's a virus, a disease, I'm a victim myself
But I swear before I leave, I'mma fix it, I swear
I'mma fix it, I swear, yo, you better beware

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Rich boy kill his own wife, knocks her teeth out
Cuts her fingers off, then escapes with a suicide
The king of pop died, Michael Vick was fighting dogs
But he walked and did his time, let him throw the fucking ball
As the markets keep crashing and people get desperate
Putting faith in the false feeling so disrespected
Turn to this record, the highest form of understanding
Understand me, fight or flight for your family
Come, walk with a soldier
Come, talk with a soldier, yeah
Cinderblock stop shooting straight from the shoulder
As we all get older and hope falls over
And damn, you were six years sober
And just like that, now you back where you started, square one
And you can't bring it back once that bullet leave the gun
As the planner gets smaller, prepare for the North American Union
A (?) to replace your dollars
Narcissistic society, love paparazzi
Get to Starbucks for your overpriced latte
Ignoring all the signs, "nevermind" is your mindstate
Until the end of time, shit is closer than you think man

[Verse 3: Trick Trick]
I done been in situations where the only thing that I could do was read the Bible
Went in to the hill, child, with a sharpened piece of metal, the only way of survival
Made up my mind that I don't ever wanna return, chance was given again
Now I'm back out in the world, made a promise to God for living in sin
I can never lie to God but it's so hard to live right
I'm carrying seven-point-six-twos to fistfights
Ain't nobody playing fair, they cheat, no cheat
I ain't fitting to be the topic of the preacher's eulogy speech
The word say, "turn the other cheek" that's what they teach us
But Peter sliced the ear of a nigga rolling on Jesus
I don't want applause I'm doing what I'm supposed to do
I'm a real nigga, one from a million, chosen few
Everlasting pain has got my brain, it's like it's trapped inside a maze
Have you been unfaithful to the game?
Damn shame
Eighteen years, you never believed him
That's your son, go and see him, motherfucker
You fucked his mother
The goddamn common courtesy never applied to you
'Cause you thought she lied to you
You couldn't see your own mother in his face
If you die, he'll be in a better place, bring the tape back
