[Xzibit]
Preemo!

[DJ Premier]
Yo Xzibit, what up
I know you ain't fuckin' with us out here my nigga

[DJ Premier]
All day, since 1989 homie

[Xzibit}
It's Mr. X to the muthafuckin' Z, MC Eiht, yeah
My nigga

[Hook: DJ Premier (Scratching)]
But never the less
You got the best

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
Whether you like it or not you gotta medicate
Pick your poison
My life is sick it'll make you nauseous
How my glass house light up the strip, I'm flawless
Came a long way from crawling
Bitch we ballin'
And my drive is derived from the city we live in
In the struggle we come through
That should never be written or ever put on a record
Niggas feelin' entitled but never puttin' the effort
Left hand on the bible, the other one on my weapon
Now american express is our only expression
And our only direction, tryna have these possessions
I'm a concrete investment in this time of recession
Bloomberg with the business
So the flow progressive
That insurance for my life is that Smith & Wesson
Never approach my section
We the stand up silver back alpha males
You a high prized hooker with ya ass for sell

[Hook: DJ Premier (Scratching)]
But never the less
You got the best
But never the less
You got the best
But never the less
You got the best

[MC Eiht]
Blue stamp get em'
Year round get em'

[Verse 2: MC Eiht]
Whether you like it or not
You gotta, blame it on the fuckin' alcohol
Niggas is with the business we ain't runnin' from y'all
Imma 4-five light up the club with shots
G'eah, music to drive by, shut down some spots
And my pride do or die for the city I claim
Never speak it in vein, Compton and [main?]
No snitches included, neighborhood recruited
Me and my bitch ride on decks, you shoot it
Hard liquor i swallow, so i'm still in the mix
You ain't promised tomorrow, so whatever you fix
Break bread for protection, neighborhood infection
Bullets, no name, any nigga direction
1-time's run the front line, they gon' shoot
While i'm tryna have me a sip, damn pickup some loot
Nowadays muthafuckas think life is easy
You don't know who I know, muthafuckas is greedy
G'eah

[Hook: DJ Premier (Scratching)]
But never the less
You got the best
But never the less
You got the best
But never the less
You got the best

[MC Eiht]
Beat'em down, loc
