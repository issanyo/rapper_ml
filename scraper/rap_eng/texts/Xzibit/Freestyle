You are now tuned in to the golden state
To all my niggas on the streets and behind closed gates
Continue to maintain daily and carry the weight
And all my folks on the outside continue to rise
Finally released to the rest of the nation, anticipation
Was killin' me, my nigga Flex said, "Niggas is feelin' me
Larger than life, baby, with crazy respect"
You know these alcoholic niggas guaranteed to get you wet"
Don't sweat the technique 'cause I was put on the street
To delete the weak minded, if you've got beef then grind it
Most niggas is blinded by the glamor and glitz
But I don't fuck with that shit
Your only dope was your last hit
Constantly lit up from the place where we hit 'em
In the wrong hair dresser have you leavin' in an ambulance stretcher
Xzibit heard a thousand strikes
I give a fuck about five mics and kerosene lights
All I need is my royalty checks my ice cold becks
So bitch, you dig ruff sex with funk master Flex
Bringin' it live from my tape deck from N.Y.C
To the W.E.S.T. switch the X to the Z
You are now tuned in to the golden state
To all my niggas on the streets and behind closed gates
Continue to maintain daily and carry the weight
And all my folks on the outside continue to rise
