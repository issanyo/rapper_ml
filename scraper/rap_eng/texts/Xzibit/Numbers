[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
Eins, zwei, drei, vier, see these cats right here?
'Bout to do numbers like lightyears
Numbers like Nike Airs, Twenty nice pairs
80 below, cold like white beers

From the polar ice caps with these nice raps
Thousand calories, y'all do light snacks
We gon' eat like twelve o'clock, recess
It's me, Strick, Wordsworth, yeah the three best

And on the request, you can ask for us
Fifty thousand watts shining in the black force
Million lights, we gon' make it bright like summer
Fake pimps, it's a threat man, I've wondered

I'm a grouch, I'm a grinch, I'm the funtaker
You the one of them forty mules, one acre
I'm the one who tell Diddy "Run to maze"
It's 18 and partying, 21 to drink

[Hook: Xzibit]
I do my numbers, hey
I do my numbers, oh
I do my numbers, hey
I do my numbers, yeah you know I do my numbers, hey
I do my numbers, oh oh
My numbers, hey
I do my numbers, yeah you know I do my numbers

[Verse 2: Wordsworth]
I take seven bad chicks to fine dinner and wine
Ask seven more chicks, they think that they fine
It will take seven more before I go for mine
That is 21 dimes on my line at the same time

I had this one chick from Beverly Hills
Popped ninety thousand two hundred and ten o' them bills
Her face was cute and her body was ill
But bipolar, I couldn't bear it and told her to chill

This one chick, she liked the way that I rhyme
Every time I take her out, she always stay on my lines
And first I just ignored her, but played with my mind
On second thought I'ma just take one day at a time, yup

This other girl I know, she wanted me, yo
Even had me moved in, and didn't want me to go
She got a girlfriend though, it's still fun for me, bro
Just one big happy family, three's company flow

[Hook: Xzibit]
Let's do my numbers, hey
I do my numbers, oh
I do my numbers, hey
I do my numbers, yeah you know I do my numbers, hey
I do my numbers, oh oh
My numbers, hey
I do my numbers, yeah you know I do my numbers

[Verse 3: Stricklin]
Online datin', she said she 5'5''
Loved Maroon 5, waits for size 5
Must admit, she was five at nine-five
In person, 5'9'' size plus times 9
If I've got
[?]
It wasn't her size, it was a line size
Here's my number: 5-5-5-5-5-5-5
