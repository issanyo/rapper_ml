Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
Cinnamon, with a taste of honey, it ain't funny
When she walk in the room, I can't help actin' a fool
I know what she like, she act right
She act like she ain't gon' survive the night
Without my dick all up in her ass, so quick, so fast
I see her twin towers and I'm ready to crash
Walk around naked witcha beautiful ass
Who the fuck taught ya how to move that fast?
It took time to perfect the stroke, by any note
Maybe we really don't need to drink and smoke
And just try a new position, perfect your dick kissin'
Bang on your G-spot 'til your voice is missin'
I don't want to love you
I just want to fuck you
You should bring your friends through
I'll fuck you and them too
I don't want to love you
I just want to fuck you
You should bring your friends through
I'll fuck you and them too
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
I work hard when I'm breakin' your back, my lil' nyphomaniac
Suck it, swallow it, down the hatch
It ain't a game when she givin' me brain, she doin' her thang
I'm up all night but I never complain
I don't waste no time with makeup lines
I just look in her eyes and read the signs
A lot of dudes wanna pull on her arm
'Cause her ass and titties light up a room like a major city
Just look how she fit in them jeans, it ain't fair
She get off too quick, when I pull on her hair
I'm the only nigga that can take you there
I ain't the only one fuckin' and I don't care
She come through with a couple of friends, a couple bottles of gin
And then that's where the party begins
And I'm the only nigga that's around for blocks
Baby, get on top and don't you stop
I don't want to love you
I just want to fuck you
You should bring your friends through
I'll fuck you and them too
I don't want to love you
I just want to fuck you
You should bring your friends through
I'll fuck you and them too
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
I know you love the way I'm diggin' it out
I know it's hard to talk with all this dick in your mouth
Menage-a-trois, for moi, let's figure this out
I drink your Hennesey fifth, let's work the shit out
She don't gotta cheat 'cause it's a waste of her time
She'll never find another dick that's bigger than mine
Hands and knees side by side, I hit from behind
Flip it up, givin' a fuck, we fuck all night
Bottom line, when I straighten your spine
I'm gon' find spots that ain't been hit and blow your mind
Get in line, bitches stay on the grind, 'cause I'm on mines
Redecorate your hips and lips and thighs
Ain't surprised, you can be so pretty and be so nasty
Ass in the air like a pass to grassi
It's a thin line between hoes and women
And close my dick with a hat and change the linen
I don't want to love you
I just want to fuck you
You should bring your friends through
I'll fuck you and them too
I don't want to love you
I just want to fuck you
You should bring your friends through
I'll fuck you and them too
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
Choke me, spank me, pull my hair
