[Shilo Harris:]
My name is staff sergeant Shilo Harris, retired United States army
Unfortunately, while serving our nation
I was hit with a roadside bomb that was estimated at about 800 pounds of explosives
I lost 3 soldiers, my truck was destroyed
My driver and I were the only 2 soldiers out of that vehicle that survived

[Hook:]
So what's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?
Man I don't know, I don't know
Cuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage
Grand larceny, cause I'm stealin' the show
What's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?
Man I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya
All I know if you spend too much time without being refined
Then your life will be described as a failure

[Verse 1:]
Let me tell you about these bitch ass, half cocked, pussy ass niggas
That's never gon' pull the trigger to protect no figures
Never seen a hard time in your life
Beating the shit out of your kids and your wife
Cause what you lack in a fight
That we all fightin' a similar, self-hated mutilation
The lost angel, Los Angeles, congratulations
From admiration, to aggravation, to the highest level
Don't be surprised you all alone when that dust settle
Heart colder than gun metal, I done survived it all
Praying for my downfall, got the fuck from around y'all
No more niggas bringing me down, even including myself
I celebrate life for nobody else
Mountains of wealth ain't really shit without health
My mental shrouded in stealth
Cause hell is crowded with cowards who fell for the dollar
Now watch Xzibit rise to power
I turn these 15 minutes to hours
But still asking

[Hook:]
What's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?
Man I don't know, I don't know
Cuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage
Grand larceny cause I'm stealin' the show
What's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?
Man I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya
All I know if you spend too much time without being refined
Then your life will be described as a failure

[Verse 2:]
Let me tell you bout' these hypocrites and halfwits
Caught up in the politics
Work yourself to death, but uncle Sam is taking all of it
Prisoner to the policy, the mark of the beast
Becoming one with technology, surveillance a beach (bitch)
And everyone one of us, some of us got no heart or no backbone
The few will seek freedom while most of the masses will conform
The woman you lust for, is usually not the one
To stick around when you go to war
Immaculate platform
We back and prepared for, attacking the landlords
Cause this shit too hot, we 'bout to get what we came for
And if I should die, may it not be in vain more
Importantly, more to see, keep it cracking and orderly
Got my future in front of me, focus is fucking phenomenal
Nobody can touch us, I turn the impossible possible with it
Do me a favor man, do not try to tell me shit
It's just me and my bitch

[Hook:]
What's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?
Man I don't know, I don't know
Cuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage
Grand larceny cause I'm stealin' the show
What's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?
Man I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya
All I know if you spend too much time without being refined
Then your life will be described as a failure

[Shilo Harris:]
When I was injured, I sustained 35% burns over my body
I lost my ears, my nose, and have been through many reconstructive surgeries
My father was there, my wife was there, my children
That was a lot of my motivation, was because
I knew the way that they were looking at me
I had to get stronger, I had to become independent again
And I think that's why I pushed so hard

[Verse 3:]
Let me tell you 'bout these long days and sleepless nights
Penny pinchin' trying to make it to the afterlife
And not to mention time is short, you better make it right
Before you see that final light get all your business tight
This is the gospel, gotta get it or get left alone
So get it on until your destiny is set in stone
The dead and gone can never tell us what comes after death
So make it count and live your life out loud with no regrets
This for the set, this for the ones that's never wakin' up
Livin' a fantasy, insanity, they fake as fuck
They out of touch, they out of line, it's time to face the truth
That I wasn't supposed to make it, now I'm living proof
Excavated mountains of misery, eventually found the fountain of youth
It'd been pissed in, shit in, violated, so they pollute
That's why they shoot, have your ass in a box dressed in a suit
'Bout time you got in touch with your roots

[Hook:]
So what's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?
Man I don't know, I don't know
Cuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage
Grand larceny cause I'm stealin' the show
What's the meaning of life?

[Shilo Harris:]
The best help that you can do, is help yourself
You have to, to step up, you have to find the strength inside of you
To pull yourself through it, because, you know, you can
You can have people pull you everyday
But unless you're willing to move, and you're willing to move forward
Then you're gonna be stuck in a rut
And you're gonna be stuck in that bad place that is depressing
And holding you back
The only person that can set you free is yourself
