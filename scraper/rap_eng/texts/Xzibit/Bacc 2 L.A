Now I can't recall ever losin' y'all
No sweat, no disrespect (I ain't trippin')
But I didn't know we was pickin' and choosin' y'all
So look back out for them West Coast niggas
The come and toast niggas, revive back and fly flat
We fly, we high off contact
(Eastside representer), Soopafly with bomb raps
West Coast, hit 'em up, we all that
Yeah we trip, they fall back
But - we cool like the wind yo'
But don't sabotage the life we lead
We gangsta ass niggas, but we could still be friends though
Now here, have some drink, smoke my weed
It's the bomb, I hit it with y'all
Do your thang, ain't no foul no harm
A nigga need a hand, I lend him my arm
(You know) we not that bad homie
We like to party hard, do our thang too
Whips and chains too
It's all lingo, real niggas connected closer than a seam yo
No matter where you're from we should all be havin' some
We all gon' stay fight, we all gon' run
The game - it's a shame niggas think I want the fame
Nah nah, I could give a damn - just know my name
But now as far as comin' out, yeah we to blame
But now we here motherfuckers, treat us the same

[Hook]
They act like they just don't hear us
Cause they know we just don't play
But don't be afraid, don't fear us
It's alright, it's okay
Don't be so down, just cheer up
Say what you want to say
Eastside Long Beach can feel us
Welcome back to L.A

Who am I, it's the D-A-Z
Give it to you funky fresh, so lovely
Xzibit, Soopafly, Alkaholiks, D.P
West Coast MC's most definitely
(I don't like that shit)
When you see me in the crowd, high
Talkin' loud and actin' wild - it's just my style
You feelin' this, labeled as a menace and gang affiliate
600 Benz, Lorenzos, homie we wheelin' it
I make the party people say "ho", I kick flow
Rock shows, be on flows like the wind blow
Skate out and burn rubber, and leave clouds of indo smoke
Like R.A.W. I ain't no joke
Don't fold up but choke up, don't provoke us loc
From Coast to Coast, who rock the most? (Dogg Pound!)
If I'm banned from your FM dial, I say "fuck it"
Have a joint and a smile - I'm still on the prowl
Be on the underground, I drop sounds that profound and out of bounds
Capture your audience, flow rhythmly like an accordion
Or tell me, are we in a world full of bitch ass niggas and girls?
On the crossfade, I made and learned trades to get paid
You might get slayed and crave what I made
Drop it at the 1, 2, 3 -

[Xzibit]
X to the Z rockin' with the D.P.G

They act like they just don't hear us

Eastside Long Beach can feel us
Welcome back to L.A

(L.A.-L.A.-L.A.-L-L-L.A.-L.A.)

[Xzibit]
Look, now tell me what's stoppin' you from hangin' around
Stuck in your hotel room whenever you come in to town
I see niggas perpetratin' like they lovin' L.A
But it ain't showin' in they video and radio play
See everyday I got to deal with this industry shit
A bunch of so call heavyweights that's scared to get hit
Prepare to get lit, with the best choke you ever smoked
And politics separate chips, we all can get rich
Release all bitch tendencies, we on the same team or we enemies
And I ain't got too many of them
A lot of hand guns and homies, I got plenty of them
I just make one phone call, you'll get riddled with ten
And that's for only when you try to get slick, and try to cross me
For now let's talk promotion over croissants and coffee
Look - I'm from the place that taught the world how to gang bang
Now I'm finna take it to the top of the food chain
