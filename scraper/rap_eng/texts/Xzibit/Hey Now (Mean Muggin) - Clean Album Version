Oh, c'mon, oh, ah, c'mon

I'm a menace to society, baby
The police wanna relocate me
They runnin' with gun up but they can't fade me
They wanted to come up but they ain't crazy

I ride one in the chamber with gun on cock
'6-tre Chevrolet rollin' without no top
Got them hydraulics that's dumpin', makin' it drop
California to Virginia, Timmy makin' it hot

Takin' long rides in the G4 plane
X Man to the stage, got 'em goin' insane
Yeah, got the world sayin' my name
I'm 'bout to make a little change
I'ma keep it the same, ya dig?

X to the Z, baby, run up on you hittin' corners
Phantom platinum grill, c'mon
X be the life of the party
Don't be scared, girl, reach out an' touch somebody

Can you feel the speakers jumpin'?
Other guys surroundin' but they don't say nuthin'
Muggin' in the club like they wanna do somethin'
Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now

All the girls mean muggin'
'Cause it musta seem what the girl pulled up in
In the club like they wanna do somethin'
Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now

Hey, girl, look where I live
40 acres an' a Maybach, Benz
You wanted to party but I got biz
This ain't entertainment, I'm feedin' my kid

On a 4 or 5 in the carpool lane
Gotta hit some corners, I'm ridin' the caine
Wanna ride out to a island an' tan your frame
An' just waste away a couple of days, holla back at me

Look, where I bat
Make the crowd get loud like the sound of a gat
'L.A.' on my baseball hat
Where they runnin' right up on you in that black on black

So move, better bounce like a mother
When brother got Mass Weapons of war with each other
X gettin' big, not ready to die yet
My militant mindset got you runnin' for cover, so, yo

Can you feel the speakers jumpin'?
Other guys surroundin' but they don't say nuthin'
Muggin' in the club like they wanna do somethin'
Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now

All the girls mean muggin'
'Cause it musta seem what the girl pulled up in
In the club like they wanna do somethin'
Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now

I'm the life of the party
I got a moon roof, we poppin' up out of
Look at the whole world, they talkin' about us
I got a mean hook to rattle yo' body

I wanna talk a little, pick ya brain
Wanna see you in somethin' little, walk around the plane
Yeah, I got a lot to gain
Gettin' my label off the ground like David Blaine

So now, what you know bout me?
I'm a self-made man from poverty
Yeah, now I own a lot of property
I pimp rides, lifestyles an' companies, so, yo

Now let me spit you the facts
I used to hustle the corner but I ain't bringin' you that
Naw, I'm like swingin' a bat
Run at yo' kneecaps for comin' out ya face like that

Baby girl, touchin' my chain
Now let me tell you who I ain't
You can't run no games
I'm gangsta, baby, ain't nuttin' changed

Can you feel the speakers jumpin'?
Other guys surroundin' but they don't say nuthin'
Muggin' in the club like they wanna do somethin'
Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now

All the girls mean muggin'
'Cause it musta seem what the girl pulled up in
In the club like they wanna do somethin'
Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now

Can you feel the speakers jumpin'?
Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now
All the girls mean muggin'
Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now

Can you feel the speakers jumpin'?
Other guys surroundin' but they don't say nuthin'
Muggin' in the club like they wanna do somethin'
Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now

All the girls mean muggin'
'Cause it musta seem what the girl pulled up in
In the club like they wanna do somethin'
Feelin' kinda rowdy, huh? Hey, now, hey, now

Let's ride on out, let's ride on out
X to the Z, Timbo, [Incomprehensible]
West Coast, East Coast, Philly
