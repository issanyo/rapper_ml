[Verse One] [Xzibit]:
The, the beginning of the best from the left let's get it
Throw your hands in the air if you wit it, hit it
Yo, my name is what?
My name is who?
What you gon' do when the man roll through (nothing)
Parking lot then hop out the drop
One of the few who rock with, the the the Doc
Bless the flock with Bishop Lamont
You get buried and your body gon' rot
Three hots and a cot
Ready or not, kick in your lock, home invasion
I don't write raps, X cracks equations
Knock, knock who's there? Knock his face in
Who you gon' call when you're facin' the state pen
I'll leave the club with a harem and won't share 'em
Wearin' 'em out, then I start tearin' 'em out
Airin' 'em out until they start carin' about
Every dirty demand, dick 'em down, diggin' 'em out
Kickin' 'em out
Givin' 'em out to large money depositing in different accounts
Here to announce, yeah

[Chorus] [Jelly Roll]:
Niggas and bitches off the wall
And can't nobody here do it like me (No!)
So enticing, ice and all
Lil' momma don't matter what you're drinkin' I'll blow your MIND
Lil' momma I'll blow your
(Roll that weed up)
When I'm twisted I'll blow your MIND
Lil' momma I'll blow your
(Hennessy and Grey Goose)
How you want it? I'll blow your MIND

[Verse Two] [Bishop Lamont]:
?, my imperialism
The essence solider for a higher order pimpin' the system
These niggas ain't in no position for opposition
I'm itchin', I'm wishin' persistin' you niggas start dissin'
So I can instantly, statistically eradicate your division
Like religion verses Darwinism
But nigga I'm church so you know I'm well versed
I'm a new era pall bearer put you in that hearse
So why even waste my time when I'd rather recline?
I'm Denzel, Smith Bokeem combined
Makin' movie money dollar signs
Yeah bitch it's yo' time
Harmonize just twenty cent, gettin' head from two dimes
Ain't a nigga on Earth that could stop my grind
Niggas hate me cause I'm pretty and a nigga rhyme
So I'mma do it like Puff, blame it on my shine/Shyne
Shit, you ain't seen me warmed up yet

[Chorus] [Jelly Roll]:
Niggas and bitches off the wall
And can't nobody here do it like me (No!)
So enticing, ice and all
Lil' momma don't matter what you're drinkin' I'll blow your MIND
Lil' momma I'll blow your
(Roll that weed up)
When I'm twisted I'll blow your MIND
Lil' momma I'll blow your
(Hennessy and Grey Goose)
How you want it? I'll blow your MIND

[Verse Three] [Crooked I]:
Uh, Crooked I just creeped in
Million dollar thug still I'm drinkin' on cheap gin
Biggie and Big Pun live in my ink pen
I dance underwater, I swim in the deep end
Uh, how much kush can you twist up?
Lamont/2Pac, yeah I fuck with both Bishops
Yeah, I mean Juice understand me?
C.O.B. till I die, nothin' before the family
Long Beach soap opera, know the drama
Every nigga that I know better fuckin' tote a Llama
Blllaow
Violatin' the code of honor
After I shot him I cried, Pac cause I know his momma
You might think that's soft but I don't care much
Cause I know I spray your white tee like an airbrush
Put my gun in your hand, you wouldn't dare bust
So with bustas, please don't compare us

[Chorus] [Jelly Roll]:
Niggas and bitches off the wall
And can't nobody here do it like me (No!)
So enticing, ice and all
Lil' momma don't matter what you're drinkin' I'll blow your MIND
Lil' momma I'll blow your
(Roll that weed up)
When I'm twisted I'll blow your MIND
Lil' momma I'll blow your
(Hennessy and Grey Goose)
How you want it? I'll blow your MIND
