(Chorus)
You Know It Could Happen
It Don't Happen Till It Happen
When It Happen
You Gonna Wish It Never Did (Hey!)
MOTHAFUCKA!

(Xzibit)
Hey Baby, Sexy Lady (Hey!)
You Make Them Pants Look Crazy (Woo!)
I Know You Schemin
Have You Leavin'
Screamin' "Fuck You, Pay Me!"
LA Got Tons Of Dameies
Thats Quick To Have That Baby
And That Try To Squeeze You
For Every Penny That You Thought Of Makin'

These Streets Is Fuckin' Viscious
Can't Make The Wrong Decisions
They Have You Shot Up
And Shot Up, Caught Up Behind Some Bitches
Handle Your Business Homie
Cause Ain't No Homies In Business
So Many People In This Business
Be So Fuckin' Phony

I See Right Through Them Traps
These Niggas Run Their Yaps
But When It Really Cracked
Them Pussy Niggas Runnin Laps
I Clap Em In They Tracks
My Paper Come In Stacks
And Stacks Of Rubberbands
Thicker Than A Paperback

Just Let The Henny Flow
Go Where You Wanna Go
My Party Heavyset
Ready Set Baby Here We Go
Its Not A Fuckin Game
You Know my Fuckin Name
I'm Number One
With A Motherfuckin Bullet MAN!

(Chorus)
You Know It Could Happen
It Don't Happen Till It Happen
When It Happen
You Gonna Wish It Never Did
MOTHAFUCKA!

(Xzibit)
My Soldiers Go With Missiles
Gauges, Grenades, And Pistols

My Soldiers Gettin' At You
Full Clip Is Spitting At You
You Duck and Stuck In Position
Just Like A Fuckin' Statue

Before You Step Your Ass In My House

(Chorus)
You Know It Could Happen
It Don't Happen Till It Happen
When It Happen
You Gonna Wish It Never Did
MOTHAFUCKA!

(Chorus x2)
You Know It Could Happen
It Don't Happen Till It Happen
When It Happen
You Gonna Wish It Never Did
MOTHAFUCKA!
