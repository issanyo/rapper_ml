Aight everybody get on the ground right now
Yeah, this is not your money this is insured by the federal government
So this is not your money, don't move
Don't be a hero, and you won't get blown the fuck up right now
Yeah, aight y'all we got three minutes
Startin now let's keep it rollin

[dogg pound]
Hit the bank from the back
Double the trouble, forcin my entry
The first nigga that i saw, shot him in the jaw
Xzibit started stompin him and so did we (get down bitch)
Aww shit, about time we started dumpin on security
High society -- takin what's mine
Snatchin each purse after purse -- for every nickel and dime
Premeditated created by the scorn and the hate
But i made ma, the big time, lights and the shine
It's a full scale war -- everybody bear arms
Wear body armor, national arms
Dip away to get away -- sirens alarms screamin
Yellin out, "hell demons of war"
Hell hounds that surround the wells fargo browns
No tomorrow, hollow, harness rounds

Take a sip of your perrier
To pay, i'ma dump like a dumptruck, scramble to make my escape
Dat nigga daz, shootin so nothin else come in
I'm shootin in the opposite direction, we closed in
Shells spread nigga -- because we can do the work
First things first -- like snoop, i'ma shoot the clerk
And i did -- now it's time to split -- get nigga get
(let's go) dumpin and shoot the hostages
Soopafly outside in the ride
Bout to start shootin everything that he see outside

Loose cannons, face covered with bandanas
Chrome pieces - motherfuck the police
It's everybody killers on mine
If i ever get caught for crime, won't be doin federal time
Loose cannons, face covered with bandanas
Chrome pieces - motherfuck the police
It's everybody killers on mine
If i ever get caught for crime, won't be doin federal time
