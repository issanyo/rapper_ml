[Intro]
Rise Up!
Bliss n' Eso
Mr. X-to-the-motherfucking-Z
Broadcasting live, listen

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
I get up, I get out, getting it in, getting it in
I'mma win, tell these motherfuckers again, I'mma win
'Til my death, 'til my very last breath
'Til my very last step on this planet, god damn it I'mma win
Mr X to the Z, give us free or get hurt
It ain't worth risking your life, I'll place your ass in the dirt
Taking off, taking off, rising up, rising up
Give a fuck, whatever, whoever, we fucking you up
I'm losing touch with reality, so let's skip the formalities
And get down to the business, Bliss n Eso is my family
So we move like the military and bury the bullshit
The congregation is growing, I preach from the pulpit
In Syd' City with Aussie chicks with huge titties
I'm not kidding, copping a squat and start shitting
On each and every one of you motherfuckers who want it
Damn it feels good to see people up on it

[Hook]
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
People up on it, people up on it [x4]

[Verse 2: Eso]
I get up, I get out, getting it in, getting it in
Give these gorillas a grand entrance, we're playing to win
This is worldwide warriors that kick start the stampede
We bring it back and let Biz mark the damn beat
They tried to tell me that I couldn't have a dream
Now I'm knocking 'em and boxing 'em like I was Danny Green
Plotting with a battle axe under the mill
Chopping heads! Making motherfuckers run for the hills
Yo, I've come for the kill, time's up, rise up
And anyone in our way can take a whiff of my nuts
I got kush in the bush, banging beats 'til the shack's shook
And X is rolling blunts out a pack of Backwoods
I'm that good sweetie, 7 days on this Earth
Fuck watch me bloody making a verse
It's like my life is a movie and I'm a kid in a comic
Yo damn it feels good to see people up on it

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You can run, you can hide you can live you can die
Put up your hands, rise up with me
And if you knew what I know it would show, but you don't so let's go
Now let me show you what my eyes can see [x2]
Come ride with me
Come fly with me
Come ride with me
Come fly with me
Come ride with me

[Verse 3: Bliss]
I get up, I get out, move at the Speed of Life for certain
The revolution's brewing man, you should see behind the curtain
I paint it picture perfect jotting the grammar
Rocking this banger as I hit the circuit dropping the hammer
Yeah, it's hella major man, we win the bout and celebrate her
It's the next level rebels in and out of elevators
My whirlwind, fell the valley of the vortex
28,000 strong rallied at your doorstep
So rise up man, we're holding up the common kids
It's the hang glider rider rolling off a monster cliff
Taking flight with my chosen flock of congregates
Known to drop the bombs a bit and boulder hop the continents
On the roller-coaster going over the Pacific
Sunset strip, vivid, blowing dosha with Xzibit
Aim for the stars, it's the kid who rides comets
Damn it feels good to see people up on it

[Hook]
