[Intro: Eminem & Lethal Thug]
This ain't beef man
I don't know what the fuck to call it
What up X

[Verse 1: Lethal Thug]
I float like Slim's spirit in this bitch i'm Shady
Roast me, cause you ain't gonna live to fight me
I'd have my motherfucking ass kicked by bullies
If I had some pussy try to diss me to do war
Physical is not a road i'm afraid to go down
I'll never go to that level to do that now
I got a new punch
This time i'm spitting two lines out
With knuckles
I finally got something to swing at now

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Let's see who got they city on lock
Let's see who got the better aim with the Glock
Let's see who come out on top
Let's see who really want their name in the streets
Let's see who wanna die the same time as me
And make ends meet
Now was I blessed with a gift or cursed with a curse
I follow hearse after hearse with verse after verse
And I'll be damned if I let Billy dance Dupri
Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree, so now

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho say my name

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
Why do you hate me
I came from nothing
Blood sweat and tears
You did not create me
How can you doubt me
You don't know shit about me
There'd be no West coast without me
Cut with the bullshit
I struggle for survival
And now you trying to act like my rival
Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life nigga, it's not worth
All the pain, all the agony
All the horror, all the tragedy
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
Threaten my life, c'mon
One day you'll understand
They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
So who the fuck you think you talking to
Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in front of you

[Hook: Nate Dogg]

[Verse 4: Lethal Thug]
I really smashed on that bullie's ass, I tapped him
Till he opened his mouth I came back and jacked him
I would of never brought it to his ass and attacked him
Until you ran around my life in circles
No wonder why your bitch slapped you till you went purple
And gave you a tattoo that'll permanently hurt you
Told me to kick your ass and physically hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it verbally and served you
I square up cause i'm sick of dismantling what's left of you
Your have your friends saying that you called me out
It's like i'm listening to bitch's fucking pussy meow!
You better trying to come stomp me out
You don't want it words, that is what i'm all about, c'mon
(I) No gangsta you ain't either
(Will) But I know that I spit ether
(Not) Don't give a fuck what you tell me
(Lose) Should a finished you already

X pass me the shovel i'm about to bury his ass for the last time
Watch your fucking mouth

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
