[Xzibit]
Where Rock at?
Rock here yet?
It's all good

[Verse 1]
I done came too far, can't turn back now
Pull it out, get it up, can't put shit down
Best believe to achieve gotta struggle to get it but peep it
It's like you got a body ????? keep it
Ain't no secret how the west coast do it
Stick a fork in it, done deal disputed (yeah)
Holdin two black aces for the smilin faces
It's a chess game nigga, better count ya spaces
We gon find the weakest link, fuck what you niggas think
Pump gon repeat and grind y'all to mincemeat
I can't retreat, refusin to lose (yeah)
Walk one day in the X man's shoes

[Hook]
Make shit happen, stomp and smashin'
On and crackin, who want action
Pistol packin, fuck relaxin'
Hit u where it hurts
Make you feel it, can't conceal it
If it breaths then I can kill it
Come and get it, custom-fitted
Hit u where it hurts

[Verse 2]
I might as well buy a suit right now
Put money on my books downtown to get ready for trial
Look, ya only gotta tell me once
Better wake up and smell these blunts
What's really behind the front
Ain't no parts about me punk
We can thump, don't get too close
Because you might get slump kicked
Front page material, I serial kill shit
Only that real shit, we can scrap or slap clips
My tactics range from Attila the Hun
To Genghis Kahn to the rice fields of Vietnam
Atom bomb my name tag across the sky
Eye for an eye, somebody got to die now

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The points that I make be hollow
X a hard act to follow
Disappear in front of your eyes, besides
I switch up rides at least five times
Dangerous minds, caught behind enemy lines
Read the signs, better yet you pick your place
Got a 4-4 eagle to split your face
Nigga you be safe we invade your space
Beat you, beat your team, then beat the case
Poker face, niggas can't read me yo
Green light a mothafucker fa sho, let's go
Stay low, we the unforgiven
Hard to touch like pussy in Britain
Can't stop me from living, muh-fucka

[Hook till end, w/ X talking]
