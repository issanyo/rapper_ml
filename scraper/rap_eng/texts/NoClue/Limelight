(Chorus: Sean Carson)
You belong next to me
Let the limelight shine only
On you and me
Never met nobody like me
And I never met nobody like you
Let the limelight run right through
Everything you knew
And I promise I won't let it blind you

(Verse 1: NoClue)
See, them other ones can't come close
Come chill with the leader of the new west coast
Get the money, then we're ghost
Then I'll show you how to drop it, then post
It's not hard to see
Clearly real ones, they don't make them like me
Not trying to talk, feel free
Really won't bother me if you don't mind me
You got them fantasizing, agonizing
Sit and seen me, now you're rising
They're despising, talk to me, no compromising
But I'm on a money mission
So I'm not even realizing
Pass you by, see you look analyzing
On how you wanna plot and be by my side and
Realize no elegize, real in me baby you and I
Lionizing me as I rise, minimize drama money wise
See lies in scandal's eyes
Arise, I'm wise, so I realize
Devise, demise what I despise
You'll walk through life as odorized
And organize ties, not even you would pass by
You can see it in my eyes, I'mma strive til I die
But until then, I'mma grind in the nightlife
With money on my mind right
And shine in the limelight

(Chorus: Sean Carson & NoClue)
You belong next to me
Let the limelight shine only
On you and me
Never met nobody like me
And I never met nobody like you
Let the limelight run right through
Everything you knew
And I promise I won't let it blind you
(Shine in the limelight) [x8]

(Verse 2: NoClue)
I don't believe in excuses
Never could I bring myself to fucking with a broad that's useless
Never wants to get the money or produces
But wants to follow a nigga around and seduces
Every guy that passes by
Let's get the real money chill on Lanai
See, you can make a few things lithify
Just tell punk ass boyfriend the same old alibi
Cuz, see I'm nothing like them
We cannot be friends
If we can't stack ends
See these past broads love to pretend
So them, do not attend
For-fend mend and then
Bending over, let me hit it from the back like that
But I'm on a money mission, so I brought that back
See, I gotta get it how I get it like that
Doing everything I say and I'mma leave it at that
Show me can't nobody really get it like you is a fact
See, they wanna tell me what I wanna hear so that
They can try to get a little bit closer
Never that level that set back never been a match
Dismiss suspicion, monition
Because I'm on a money mission, just listen
Punishin positions and proposition
And then we, and then we grind in the nightlife
With money on our mind right
And shine in the limelight

(Chorus: Sean Carson & NoClue)
