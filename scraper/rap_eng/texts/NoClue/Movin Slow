Verse 1:
What do I gotta do to see success
Visualizing and analyzing I was the fucking best
Was it my perspective of life that had them thinking less
Dear God, forgive me for my sins but I no longer stress
Ever since Betty Moore was put to rest
So now I'm feeling like fuck what's best
I'm on a money mission, never listen, feeling possessed
I'd rather die before I fail than ever live through regrets
So here I am, live and direct through my own request
I was forced, neglected, disrespected, perspective of I
So I emphasized what they glorify and created I
Took the minister's side but the Devil would walk in my life
How can I visually analyze while I'm living my life

Bridge:
Blinded but I'm seeing clearly
God, are you too busy to hear me
They gave me a felony cause them bitches fear me
So tell me how I feel inside
They're envious, hate and despise
Told them look me in my eyes

Chorus x2:
I put my all into everything and it shows
While they're visualizing and analyzing
But still, they're moving slow
So here I am emphasizing a goal
My destiny in control, it's in my soul
Never moving slow

Verse 2:
At times I really don't give a fuck
So I'm constantly praying to God, so listen up
All the drama that I witnessed, but still remain untouched
I've seen so much, so fuck what they're talking about
This world has got me fucked up
Dear God, forgive me for my sins
But, the only boundaries are the ones I establish and choose to live within
Could I be wrong for saying fuck friends
Control my physical expressions, so they'll never comprehend when
Sometimes I feel like I should flip out
Murder every motherfucker that double crossed me, then just dip out
But I gotta be smart and think out
Watch what I say because they speak out
Information just leaks out

Bridge:
Blinded but I'm seeing clearly
God, are you too busy to hear me
They gave me a felony cause them bitches fear me
So tell me how I feel inside
They're envious, hate and despise
Told them look me in my eyes

Chorus x2:
I put my all into everything and it shows
While they're visualizing and analyzing
But still, they're moving slow
So here I am emphasizing a goal
My destiny in control, it's in my soul
Never moving slow

Verse 3:
You gotta take control of your destiny
Fuck that nobody's letting me
Like they won't get the best of me
Shake the Devil, he's testing me
I could see why they're hating me
But the envy's not making me understand that it's taking me to this level creating me
Impossible to figure out, just something small to think about
Next time you try to figure out what I'm about
No time to be lazy, admit it, money persuades me
My drive is driving me crazy
I feel like shit doesn't phase me
But all jokes aside, fuck what anybody says, I'm living my life
And I wonder could they ever realize
They're envious, hate and despise
But I learned to be wise

Bridge:
Blinded but I'm seeing clearly
God, are you too busy to hear me
They gave me a felony cause them bitches fear me
So tell me how I feel inside
They're envious, hate and despise
Told them look me in my eyes

Chorus x2:
I put my all into everything and it shows
While they're visualizing and analyzing
But still, they're moving slow
So here I am emphasizing a goal
My destiny in control, it's in my soul
Never moving slow
