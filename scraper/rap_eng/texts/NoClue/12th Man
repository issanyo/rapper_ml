[Intro]
Camera Flash , bright Light , Championship in sight/
We rise in Moments we fight let all unite/
We're the ones they can't hold Beast Mode/
Come against us they fold , we'll go/

[Part 1]
12th Man let us Stand win the Challenge dont Understand/
Can't they see we posses the ball with the palm of our Hands/
60,000 Fans in the Stands , its the Plan/
Let it Echo , never have i heard a sound so Grand/
Hands clap we're the loudest can't ignore/
Break world records just to shake the Floor/
Knock down doors hear the Stadium Roar/
This is that moment that everybodys been waiting for/
Said i won't make it but im right on time/
Camera Flash my time to shine and never happend over night/
We hat to grind , now im stepping on the field like the World is mine/
Many obstacles that we had to climb , but we been trough the worst but it helped define/
Now we're living in the Moment let the light shine walk in the door right now its prime time/
Never lose hope , never lose hope/
We stand where they dont , we stand where they dont/
Try to always stay alfoat , and if they doubt you ,/
It's because you do what they won't/

[Bridge]
Camera Flash , bright Light , Championships in sight/
This is the night , we fight , live in the moment , we write/
Shake them Left than hit right , clear vision , we been tight/
Dove in the Zone , take flight , now let the Fire inside ignite/

Camera Flash , bright Light , Championship in sight/
We rise in moments we fight , let us all unite/
Were the ones they can't hold Beast Mode/
Come against us they fold , we'll go/

[Part 2]
No more anticipating or waiting, the moment's now,/
No more debating hating this is the best around,/
No more relating we shake them,then shake them out the town/
Can't you hear the sound, echo aroung the puget sound/
Fear the players and the fans, in a trance , acting crazy in the stands/
Hear us shout , fireworks bring them out , hear us scream don't acknowledge other teams/
No salvation , erasin' , a single word could make kingdoms crumble/
And empires shake down to their very foundation/
Whatever trend i'm replacing , elimination/
They're facing curse implication is following you in rotation , chasin'/
Gray , Blue , Green , White , Always been ready to fight/
Clear sight , strike them with all of our might/
Think twice and don't test , we just might/
