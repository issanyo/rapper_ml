(Intro:)
Give ear to my prayer, O God
And hide not thyself from my supplications
Attend unto me, and hear me
I mourn in my complaint and make a noise
Because of the voice of the enemy
Because of the impression of the wicked
For they cast iniquity upon me
And in worth, they hate me...

(Verse 1: NoClue)
Through all my trials and tribulations
I should have seen the relations
Forgive me for my temptations
And bless me through emulation
I'm walking in revelations
Your blood is my circulation
Have mercy on my soul and salvation
Limitation had me facing
I've been interrogated, debated, hated, incriminated
Incarcerated like they don't wanna see me make it
Have me staring at the world like I hate it
I prepared it and crenellated in case I don't make it
Dear God, walk with me
I've been through so much drama, can you just talk to me?
I see myself doing some things lately that's not in me
Can you give me a sign or something that's constantly
Got me feeling like it's not me, is this prophecy?
That got me losing my mind and going insane
And feeling like I'm willing to change
And at the same time I hear the Devil calling my name
Maintain sane, the pain that came changed
His name became vain
(Ha Ha)
Can you meet me, I'll be in the Valley of Dry Bones
Have mercy on my soul, paranoid, I'm all on my own
Dethrone my words, engravin them in grey stones
Ain't nobody hand me nothing, I did it all on my own
Reverential thinking, prudential, living essential
Begging God to keep me consensual, see potential
Said I'm mental, mentally torrential
Then became elemental
I'm living, the reason they're judgmental
