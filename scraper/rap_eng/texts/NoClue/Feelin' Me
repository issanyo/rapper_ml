Chorus x2:
So you feelin me, right
I put that good old dick in your life
Have you facing forward, grab your hair
Introduce you to this real nigga
Not them other squares

Verse 1:
She's like, "You know you're gonna fuck
Got me doing crazy things, feeling like a slut"
I'm like, I'm the type that'll beat it up
Til you nut like that's what's up
Bending over, let me hit it from the back
Wanna bite that with your head back
Never thought you'd like that
What you really wanna do, don't fight that
Bending over, making you cum
Now you're right back
I know exactly how you feel inside
If you only knew how I pursue
The freaky shit I'll put you through
I'll flip the script on a chick
Have her screaming for the dick
As I pursue to take her chips
I'm on some other type of shit
And I'll never love a ho
Always on a money mission, always on the go
Any little breezy wanna get it, let me know
But we gotta move fast 'cuz I can't go slow
I have no time for playing games
Fuck bitches, treat them the same
Pussy drippin wet, screaming my name

Chorus x2:
So you feelin me, right
I put that good old dick in your life
Have you facing forward, grab your hair
Introduce you to this real nigga
Not them other squares

Verse 2:
What you really wanna know
Have this bad bitch, thick thighs, nice eyes
Run about 5'5", I hit it from the back
Grab her hands, pull it back
Hear the clap, hear the clap
Then I put her on her back
Knew this bitch named Dasia
Said I was a mac, put the silly ass trick on the track
So many hoes, try to get a mothafuckin nigga trapped
Now they heard that I rap
Now they're running, like "Rick, take me back"
This sexual seduction got you lovin the way that I'm fuckin, no frontin
Lovin the real in a nigga, consumed, so what are you wantin
I know exactly how you feel inside
You despise, visualize between the lies
With fantasies of you and I
And they wanna get all sentimental
Feel the pressure when the type of nigga like me stick it in the middle
She's like, "Can you be a little gentle, cuz the way you beat it up got me feelin funny mental"
Yall bitches come a dime a dozen
It was nothin, so what you thought it really is, what it really wasn't

Chorus x2:
So you feelin me, right
I put that good old dick in your life
Have you facing forward, grab your hair
Introduce you to this real nigga
Not them other squares

Verse 3:
You're lovin the way that I'm stickin this dick in you
Finger fuckin yourself when I'm not with you
Pushin back, said that it's too deep up in you
I got many bitches, so how can I miss you
The truth is, I'm not trying to be rude
But it's like, every single broad that I came through, ran through
Got a little stuck up, fucked up attitude
Let's start this introduction with some sexual seduction
Hypothetically speaking, your strong feelings got you fussing
My past bitches turned out to be nothing
So the only thing that's on my mind, "You sucking or fucking?"
Let's just be fuck friends
No sentimental trials or tribulations
Push it in your face and sexual relations
Late night demonstrations, spermicidal lubrication
Just in case, in penetration, got you facin' situations
Expression through respiration

Chorus x2:
So you feelin me, right
I put that good old dick in your life
Have you facing forward, grab your hair
Introduce you to this real nigga
Not them other squares
