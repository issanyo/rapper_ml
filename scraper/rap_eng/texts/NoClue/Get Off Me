[Chorus]
I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
Trick, get off me, you can't get shit off me
I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
Trick, get off me, you can't get shit off me
I'm so flossy, no 6s or Sprees
Laidback, Maybachs, don't even talk to me
I'm so flossy, no 6s or Sprees
Laidback, Maybachs, don't even talk to me

[Verse 1: NoClue]
Laid back, NoClue, haha
You can feel the wrath of a menace from the beginning
Come against a type of nigga like me and I'm sinning
Better pray to God that you're in it to win it
Cause I get to rippin it like ain't nobody fuckin with it
Too egotistic, list it, raps theistic
Fuck, you missed it
Gotta couple loose screws in my head
So you better keep your distance
Keep a witness hit list
Always been a little conceited and cocky
Daring anybody to come up and stop me
Even little model broads can't knock me
If it ain't about money, man, I'm way too bossy
I'm like, don't even talk to me
No need for flocking me, you won't get it off me
He's emit illuminosity, monstrosity, velocity
My head's so big, like fuck a broad not jockin' me
Livin rap God, atrocity
Legend, profit or prophecy
Pomposity, callosity
Never let it from stopping me
Cause I'm so bossy
Bitch, get off me
Trick, get off me, you can't get this off me
If it ain't about money, then you probably lost me
Cause money, money, money, money, money
Gotta get it
Money, money, don't be no dummy
Ain't nothin funny, get money

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: NoClue]
It's orchestrated, contemplated
Battled, then crenellate it
No time to conciliate it
I'm on a money mission
Then I dominated, invaded, no correlated
Why're they looking mad that I made it
Cause I came and delayed it
Bullshit, faded it
I'm what they awaited
Masticated, captivated, some do hate it
Correlated, no related, some do hate it
Get to rippin, flippin and dippin, trippin
They crave it
I'm a rap God against all odds
I'ma ride shotgun with a broad from Riyadh, no facade
I'm a living demi god but they'd rather see me locked up
Plod in the quad
But I pay no attention
In position, just gettin
While they sittin, wishin, witness realness spittin, ventin
Laureate, it was yet
Too conceited to confess, so I insulated myself
And blocked inlet
Said I wasn't nothing, wasn't looking through a laureate
I was more like a criminal felon with a vest on his chest
Had me praying to God like kismet
Walking through the valley of death like what's next
I'd seen it all but yet my mind's set
I tend to send threats, I'm so self possessed
See, my mind's gone, I'm so wrong
Just to gain, I'll force harm and break arms
Arms that hold mics that don't belong
See, all along, I masticated, captivated, implicated
Take your life and execrate it
I'm that nigga they awaited

[Chorus x2]
