[Verse 1]
NoClue (Hahaha)
It's a plot to a scheme
Wanna see y'all throwin' the dub when I step on the scene
Bigger figures and bigger dreams
The life that I've never seen is never what it seems
But as soon as I step on the scene
With an attitude like I don't give a fuck
I'm lovin' the way she's shaking her butt
Got me fantasizing and I really wanna cut
Take her to the back of the truck to see what's up
I'm so consist, remember the West in '96
Death Row, multiple gangsta hits
Never gonna be the same
See the game's gonna flip every time I spit
So let's slide to the side, everybody that's feelin' the vibe
Lemme see you throw ya hands in the sky and everybody let's rise
So tell me what you know about the West
Wear a bulletproof vest on your chest in the West
Manifest in the West
Show your fatty in the Caddy in the West
So tell me y'all forgot about the West
Legendary, young literary, preliminary never limitary
Clown fools like it's meditary
The rap game's most revolutionary
Half the rappers in the game are very scary
Y'all know what's up
Four fingers up, two twisted in the middle with the thumb cuffed
If you're real, let me see you throw it up
Makin' money, then you never got no time to sluff
From Sea-Town to Sac-Town
The bay area and back down
From Portland to Oakland, L.A. up and smokin'

[Hook x2]
We West Coast representin', throwin' up them dubs
Collar poppin', chickens jockin' 'cuz they wanna get cut
We throw the west up high
Can't nobody see the west when we ride
So throw your hands in the sky
And now my Niggas, let's rise

[Verse 2]
I'm the most lyrically elevated, articulated, behated
I physically orchestrated
See, they mad that I made it
Incriminated, they stated, interrogated, debated
See, I manipulated, the rap game's been invaded
Metaphorically been related
Captivated, opinuated and verbally irritated
The mind that contemplated
These artists are animated
The game's been fabricated but only through what you make it
Ain't nobody showin' nobody no pity in the West
Everybody already been feelin' gritty in the West
All the females wanna get all pretty and show their kitty
Come and be apart of the committee, only in the West
Everybody from the Southeast to the Midwest
Never gonna be the type to be put to the test
You need to take a little time to confess
I'm really one of the best, never less
Got them feeling the thump in their chest
I'm a rare version, emergin', conversion, inversion
Encouragin', of a lyrical reversion and urgin'
Swervin' and splurgin', reconversion Metaphorically servin'
Super supremacist, lyrical, physical, typical nemesis
Lyrically gifted, see the bitches, they reminisce
Taking my greedy self, precipitation, so serious
Speculated, motivated, impersonated, related, eliminated
Too good to be rated but hated
Debated, never degraded
Disintigrated, could they be mad that I made it Or that I came and invaded
So, From Sea-Town to Sac-Town
The bay area and back down
From Portland to Oakland, L.A. up and smokin'

[Hook x4]
We West Coast representin', throwin' up them dubs
Collar poppin', chickens jockin' 'cuz they wanna get cut
We throw the west up high
Can't nobody see the west when we ride
So throw your hands in the sky
And now my Niggas, let's rise
