[Chorus:]
But all my people want something for the streets
Want something for the streets [x3]
Its that status show off t shirt you heard

[Verse 1:]
My real ones salute
Loosen your pants pussy boy this is hiphop
This for the hiphot supporters real ones trying to keep hiphop
In order get not with order won't do a bed not reporter
Crime to the pigs not at order clips pop at ah ya
This is not for commercialise come pussy there's a line
Act gangster does not really qualify
We street certified write your death certificate
With the aids needle full of blood not sterilized
Terminal do it for clutching there burning thys
Say once you stop they drug with the birds and rhymes
You might of heard of mine teams show off clips
We load ours clips and go do our shits uh
We so haunted state fair blow our spliff
Do it for the troubled kids in the mix it's the juvenile
From the streets took it to the movies now

[Chorus:]
But all my people want something for the streets
Want something for the streets
That st show off shit you heard
(Want something for the streets )
Want something for the streets  [x2]
This for the legit brothers who spit
Though i got your shit cut up
From them words that your lips utter

[Verse 2:]
You still stutter your shit is shattered of any matter
I really bag your bitches wanted to make a calender with her
You battling with the most savages bitter is my rapping
Which hits you and pierce through you like a javelin hits you
My caliber isn't for the average contender
You better have eye with the clipping
You be blessed that you still living
For rapping and fashion me again posing
In Front all of those tricks a hammer they've been holding
Come through this kid is exploding
Staying in the gutter like we all suck at candlepin bowling
Cameras quick rolling they ain't trying to see this
Killing them niggers seven dollars of of each disk
Repeat this like ninety four dollars in the fielders we beast this

[Chorus]
All my people want something for the streets
Want something for the streets [x3]

[Verse 3:]
The drunk kid mix with a simple combination
Put me in your top five cancel all the hating
New jag like nino said cancel
That bitch perl handle on the mannequin
In case you want to flip grab a plate
Put the work get your raise up
My body guards having chicks kissing chicks like lady love
It's crazy fuck so murder your ass for eighty bucks
Shoot you right if front of your mom while
All i can say is it sucks
Dont mis understand when he says we put the raise up
Got a gun name nemo when i raise her up
Pay along is what you better do tonight
In other words book it like you said you would a flight
Is not for the body better do life you gamble with death
We better do life i bury ya’ll when i’m spitting an about to take flight
Only thing i pass on is tradition
Listen

[Chorus]
