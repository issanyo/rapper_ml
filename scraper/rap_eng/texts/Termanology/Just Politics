[Intro]
It's more politics
Just Blaze goodlookin'

[Verse 1]
One hand on the pad
Other hand is on the bag
In a Kaperneck jersey, I ain't standing for the flag
Might as well be the Confederate, the way they so devilish
Treat men in blue above the law, like we irrelevant
Kill us on the camera, with little to no answer
And Ignorance is spread through the street, like it was cancer
Even Obama couldn't do shit, but propaganda
Not even Sway, Ye' or Allen Iverson had the answer
Monopolies, turned to heath insurance policies
And student loans designed to keep you in poverty
Shorty, what you gon do wit ya life?
Are you gon spend 5 hours a day looking at likes
Or you gon get a education, and have you a revelation
That saving your soul leads your to permanent salvation
Or you go out drinking and falling for temptation
Thinking you sleeping with a person, you really sleeping wit Satan
Only thing you got when you die is ya legacy
And ya soul, let's hope you ain't sell it and live heavenly
The devil be, over your shoulder and he be plotting
So what now?
Now it's up to you to stop him

[Hook]
Back in the game like I never left
I just spit it even harder each & every breath
I got two daughters, now I'm smarter
Ain't no going left
I'm going straight to the top
My fans know me best

[Verse 2]
Just hit me with the beat, said it's a loop wit no drums
So I'm a go in spit till I got no lungs
Every time I'm at bat, I hit a home run
The cyphers and boding rappers, that's what I'm know from
I opened up my heart, poured it out for y'all
Let you consume a lil bit, like it's alcohol
It's not that I'm hating man, I'm just looking out for y'all
The type of shit y'all rap about, I wouldn't talk about at all
End up like Bobby Shmurda
Doing time for the murder
When you could have been a wordsmith, spitting shit with a purpose
Looking at the game like a parent of a sick child
Hoping it's something we can get thru, and we can fix now
Yeah we love the Henny and Moet, and sip that Cristal
But look in ya bank account, You ain't probably got six thou
Corporations controlling your mind
What you see on ya TV and what you seeing online
Capital Hill conferences, just to keep you in line
But I ain't tryna get too deep, I'm just tryna rhyme
They said we'd never have a black president, but we did
But for the future of the my kids, I continue to Dream B.I.G
