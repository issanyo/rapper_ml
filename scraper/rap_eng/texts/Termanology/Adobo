[Verse 1: Termanology]
I'm in the zone this year
Made a few hundred thousand dollars on my own this year
Yup, the rap version of fish scale, we got 'em hooked
And how it looks, the pot is outside in the kush
So however we got to get it
Selling guns and yay and putting out records
Whatever method of madness bring the cabbage
Sick of people saying I ain't celebrity status
Been around the world and smashed some of the baddest
On the raddest of mattresses, batting they lashes
Funny thing is apparently I'm so attractive
The bitch started squirting before I pulled out the maggot
Hold up, my salsa moves is on fire right now
Show off, S-T dot
Run off of the brag and show me where the duffel bag
Don't get me fucking mad, my killers'll stuff your dad
Or take a different approach
R. Kelly to your bitch, go and piss in her throat
From pitching coke to sitting on boats
My life is eclectic, ice on the necklace
Spend half my life ducking sheisty detectives
Can't match the price, you ain't got no connections
It's hard being a dope boy in rap
These fucking nerd critics don't understand where I'm at
You went to a good school and had a lot of money
I went to a hood school and had to dress bummy
Only time I had money was the Easter bunny
I'm still mad so I don't like nobody speaking to me
Fuck the world with a dirty dick
Give thirty-six ounces of yay and I'll murder it
