Your my number one, Said it's nothing like the first love
My first love, Who would've known you were first up?
My first love, Sometimes it hurts love
My first love, Said it's nothing like the first love

[Verse 1]
Nothing like it
Can't describe it
Cuz, your love is so vibrant
And your vibe is so pure
Better then any rap tour
You helped me grow up and mature
Them times when you was young, I was lost for sure
Then God opened up the door, that joy that was in store
I never could of imagined, this feeling I couldn't fathom
Did you know I dropped tears
On the day that we met
I was impressed, and nervous, and kind of obsessed
I promised God that day, I would show you respect
And anything that's unholy, I would try and do less
I wake up you on my mind
Go to sleep and I pray for you
Canceled all these shows cuz I couldn't stay away from you
I used to think my first love was cash
But met my true first love the day I became a dad

[Verse 2]
Said dear queen Aliyah, I'm so proud of you now
Knew I made the right choice, so happy I stuck around
Lord knows it wasn't easy, I did all that I could
How could I get you out when I was still stuck in the hood
I swear I love you so much I don't know where to start
And there's a pain in my heart every time we apart
I keep looking in your face and you look like me
You cross your arms, get mad stomp your foot like me
I swear you like my best friend, only one I can trust
I had to fight so hard just to know you it's rough
Don't like to think about it now cuz we over that stuff
The way I grew up with my dad I was holding a grudge
I had to fix it, and break that chain, I'm on a mission
Cuz this ain't gon end up like one of them motion pictures
You my first love
But now we got a second
What a blessing, congrats you a wonderful big sister
