[Verse 1: Reks]
Godly guidance amidst the violence
Death is silence, life is blindness
Remind us how we're supposed to find this
Escape from hell, get a clue before we face the cell
Before the paper trail, somebody's body fell
Nigga took an L, knew the boulevards too well
The avenues and alley ways got plenty of tales
The penitentiaries leave 'em mentally frail
So many centuries pass here, we lack still
Somewhere ip in the Catskills let us chill, get away
Man, I stay with Advils, brain pains, mad ills
On tracks spills that rap real
Return of the hunger before you have deals
I wonder why the crack kills
Niggas still sell, still cop drop still
Body stiff, eyes wide, lost grills,  momma feels
We shall prevail but we still gotta wake 'em up
All elementary tell me, dawg, wheres the love?

[Hook]
I, Visionary
Seen bodies getting buried
Lying in the cemetery or in the penitentiary
Violence necessary
Are you Hell or Heaven ready
Simple A, B, C's
Man, this here is elementary
One Love, one life
We gonna make it through one night
(I hear them say) One love, one Life
We gon' make it through one night
I hear them saying

[Verse 2: Termanology]
V-I-Z-I-O-NARY 'til we own every house on our block
We're so buried in debt that we seem to forget
We own nothing except a couple pairs of Jordans and some Henny and
Painfully I regret, we accept that we live check to check until our death
And we leave a couple of kids, hopefully they bury us
Without causing them too much stress
Cause they already worry 'bout too much rent
Got a fresh baby momma only two months in
In the old days people used to pay for their sins
Giving money to the church, hoping they get in
Now, what's worst, denial, or pre-trial?
A judge holding a gavel, a thug with a big barrel
My people told me it's nothing, it's me just being para'
'til I see them blue lights, just a never ending battle
Where's the love?

[Hook]
I, Visionary
Seen bodies getting buried
Lying in the cemetery or in the penitentiary
Violence necessary
Are you Hell or Heaven ready
Simple A, B, C's
Man, this here is elementary
One Love, one life
We gonna make it through one night
(I hear them say) One love, one Life
We gon' make it through one night
I hear them saying

[Verse 3: Reks]
Youth without youth, they grow so fast
Kids with kids lack truth to pass to seeds  the cycle of life
This trifling, Eiffeling set of stairs to bare
We climb on a road to nowhere, with no cares or worries we're
Free spirits who hear it late, the gates close
Hour glass sands hold no longer strands so the time's up
Find us where the early sun sets
And guns kept force fears in peers bully the block for years
There's a problem in the mental make-up
The sense you'll wake-up, gray hairs old age, elderly scared
Where we go from here, when the days up
Clock no longer tick the politics of power keep us powerless
Wish I was just a simple man, not a visionary
Vision scary Our Father's and the Hail Mary's rarely
Save them from the cemetery, dog we gotta wake 'em up
It's elementary, Where's the love?

[Hook]
I, Visionary
Seen bodies getting buried

One Love, one life

(I hear them say) One love, one Life
We gon' make it through one night
