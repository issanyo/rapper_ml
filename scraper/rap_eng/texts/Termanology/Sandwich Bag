(Verse 1: Termanology)
My shit sour, like my baby mama attitude
Which one both of them I got two (uh)
Its like a zoo in my head
I spent my last 5 bucks on the cup for the keg
I'm addicted to chron
And since 8th grade yeah I be taking hits from the bong
Weed popping out the sandwich bag
I smoke arizona mids and the shwag
(Back in the day) Then I moved up to the dro
Moving up like price of gold or the price of snow
I'm in the Chrysler slow
Berry dutch lighting smoke
Felling like I got struck by a lightning bolt
Put coke under the microscope
Get her heart racing then I pipe her slow
Everyday is 420
Smoke weed eat good now its back to getting money

Hydros chilling we just chilling
What more can I say we feeling
We dealing stacking bricks to the ceiling
Ima kill it This nickle and dime bag we ? it
Puff on the marijuana juana
If you wanna wanna
We gonna get you high
Puff on the marijuana juana
If you wanna wanna
We gonna get you high

(Verse 2: Typ iLL)
I take an el to the head when im blunted
Its nothing that ritual bit
Shout out to styles p never leave residual shit
Give me that lighter and watch for your mom
Beat box fuck it call me mcguyver gravity bong
Sheet rock bucket antisocial LA to NY bicoastal
Check the resume the bag of haze will turn my rhymes postal
Came in the door, dogs hustling chron
Ginsu splitting dutch finger tips wasn't good enough
As a younging my first blunt was a disaster Had all the cats laughing
Thank god my crew they had compassion
My told me the ? later hypocritical newports blazer
Told me take out the cancer paper That purple had me chilling
Even in nine seven had to turn that radio off and put that cypress hill in
? were razor sharp writing skills Cypress style
Typ & term boston to long island now

(hook: Typ iLL)
Hydros chilling we just chilling
What more can I say we feeling
We dealing stacking bricks to the ceiling
Ima kill it This nickle and dime bag we ? it
Puff on the marijuana juana
If you wanna wanna
We gonna get you high
Puff on the marijuana juana
If you wanna wanna
We gonna get you high
