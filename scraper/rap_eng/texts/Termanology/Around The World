[Intro:]
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world

[Chorus:]
All around the world when I'm in yo city
You can be my favorite girl
We can go around the world, around the world
Around the world
Around the world

[Verse 1:]
I'm gonna be a single man til the day I die
My booty calls never die, they just multiply
Caramel cuties with booties straight out the movies
Dominican mamasita smoking reefer and my knees on
I travel beyond light years and eons
Portugal to Paris, ripping them panties off
You hear me call for, you hear me stutter
I'm serious with the cutter but I'm a pimp motherfucker
I stay lyin to chicks and they be buyin me kicks
And I be flyin in whips so they be eyein my shit
I'm high as shit with another bitch
Don't mean it wrong, yo I even call my mother bitch
I'm on some other shit, different baby mother shit
And different continents around the populous
I'm on top and nobody is stopping this
All around the world, made some big poppa shit

[Chorus:]
All around the world when I'm in yo city
You can be my favorite girl
We can go around the world, around the world
Around the world
Around the world

[Verse 2:]
I don't got time for the bullshit
35 mm lens, I'm focused
Grew up in the project, raised with the roaches
Plastic on the lamp shades, plastic on the sofas
Nothing in the fridge, no lights on neither
Only eatin fast food, nothing in the freezer
My life style got me heatin up, cold pizza
Tryna make a dollar out of selling old reefer
Speakers banging out that shit that make you weaker
Girl it's nice to meet you, we can kick it like FIFA
I just want a quickie, you can keep on yo sneakers
Every time you with me, every day's like easter
True, California niggas don't play
We be sittin sideways, dippin on 6 trays
Tryna get paid from LA to the bay
I had a mind to delay but now I'm on my way
So I'm...

[Chorus:]
All around the world when I'm in yo city
You can be my favorite girl
We can go around the world, around the world
Around the world
Around the world

[Verse 3:]
Look, girls in front of my telly, I'm yelling let em in
Late nights, I'm feeling like David Letterman
Kick em out, bring another and get some head again
I got all these bitches going crazy like Kevin Fetherlin
Rolling my weed up, I let the sour burn
They had they run for a minute but now it's our turn
I hit er once then pass it and you can have er Term
We had er naked in the studio like Howard Stern
Got a bitch out in Cali that love to blow trees
Every time I'm fuckin she sippin OE's
Got a bitch in Toronto that smoke that blue cheese
Hit the strip club and bring all that paper to me
I ain't wifin these hoes, why the fuck would I cuff em?
We be lovin these hoes, I just hump em and dump em
Strapped up lil homie, we never said draw
All around the world, I see you hoes on my next floor

[Chorus:]
All around the world when I'm in yo city
You can be my favorite girl
We can go around the world, around the world
Around the world
Around the world
