[V1: SuperSTar Snuk]
I got to shake out this evening/while they prayin for steven
Been slangin this weed n this coke and I been hopin to leave
But I can’t kuz I’m broke and im fiendin to take a toke and then breathe in
Get drunk as a muthafucka/then fucka s lsut till she bleedin
I suck her butt till she screamin and upper cut her then leave and go
Cuddle up with my BM like “Yeah, that Snuk is a demon”
I got a devious way and they can tell there’s just something about em
On beats I don’t play, okay? I slay em/just wait for the album
I’m feelin myself a lot kuz im fillin myself wit vodka//im willin to
Help the cause I just gotta get off my rocker
I’m feelin insane again/the beat gon bring it out me
Wit ‘ology beside me to body this shit up properly
There is no comin back from this rappin shit/im in deep no
I write a track for a platinum rapper/you kick a freestlye
Now what’s upon us: the feast, a monster/a beast
N I’m SuperSTar Snuk/fuckin up these Shawneci beats

Yo... you know the way this thing goes
We bout to take it to the pinnacle
(to the tip) oh (to the tip) oh
(to the tip) Yeah…but you don’t hear me tho

[v2: Artisin]
It seems like the world is
Cavin in/Im brave in a crazy terrain wit
Niggas bustin gauges and can leave u subterranean
Police is quick to cage you in……niggas marry aliens
Just so they can walk freely upon the US pavement
Chasin an opportunity that isn’t promised truthfully
But that’s the way the world do and it isn’t nothing new to me
This hip-hop….is in my boots/its deep up in the roots a me
It gave a boost to me….ever since I needed a booster seat
Forever ST…cuz all I ever knew was street
Y’all niggas was in class/shit, the street was like a school to me
It schooled me on how to decipher niggas that is true to me
It schooled me on how not to get locked…doin a 2 to 3
Schooled me on who really frontin and who really shootin
Better take a lesson/know you gonna find the message gruesomely
Had to find a way thru the loop/vultures is loopin me
Circling overhead/its just Lucifer noosin me

[V3: Termanology]
War’s extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take things to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It’s assassination day/I stalk my enemies like prey
Wit a AK/little hand gun wit a silencer
Bazooka…that’ll prlly blow a whole island up
Pour acid in ya hookah/kill ya when u lite it up
Put aids on a razor/infect you when it line you up
“I’m wassup” ask ya bitch, that’s the new slogan
Every time you took a train,I was passin through logan
I was prolly runnin train/getting caught up in the moment
Had to go and find an angel/last chick was the omen
Call ya shorty “BUCK SHOT”/don’t front: I got her open
I’m a smooth dude. Jewelry clear, blue like the ocean
Listening to WU/drunk by myself wit the potion
Spit supercalifragilisticexpiali-dope…..shit
