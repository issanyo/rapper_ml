Better bundle up. It's a cold cold world

[Hook]
Cold world, cold cold world
Cold world, it's a cold cold world
When the box cutters go...
Cold world
When the box cutters go...click click
Cold world

[Verse: Termanology]
Listen I, bang my weapon out, Shanghai
Rippin' all chains off, whippin' out chainsaws
Puerto Rock shit, quick to pop shit
Got the Ziplock shit for the bigger profit
Chillin' in the cockpit
O.T. overseas, suitcase out, handlin' a stock tip
Listenin' to 'Pac's shit
Fiendin' to pop shit
Label cats tryin' to get the god to make pop shit
What about the gossip?
Did he ever pop clips?
If he did, would he put it on a song and snitch?
On himself with the shells still stuck in the clip
On the shelves now I pushed back, stuck with The Clipse
Hot album, no street date, money in the briefcase
A lot of y'all cheapskates softer than a cheesecake
Urgin' y'all to be safe
A message to relay
When I'm down in Philly I ain't lookin' for a cheese steak
Lookin' for a rebate
You made a mistake
You can tell it's bad when they tellin' y'all to "keep faith"
Instead you betray like friends that greet jake
Your O's come in 24 like three eights
I'm wanted in three states
Phone's all prepaid, I'm runnin' like 3K
Songs are replayed
I wanna see brains
How could I refrain?
Cause when the beef came you hollered a chief's name
I'll let your meat hang, machete your weak frame
Nothin' but a 'g' thang, Puerto Rock re-gang
