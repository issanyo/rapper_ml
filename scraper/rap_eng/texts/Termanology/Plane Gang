[Verse 1: Reks]
I been on my raw shit, my oh shit, my killer tall shit
With the Plane Gang, boomerang tosses
Fantastic four-ces flowing like faucets
A bunch of F you's abusing artists
All this is is optimist forming
Competition is boring, yawning
Y'all in no position to forget your mittens
When the fingers in the oven, [?] Dan Gloving
Racist [?] with the standard headhunting
Dammit I be bugging, pandemonium loving
Plan to blow a bug then reduce us to [?]
Imposters, posse of the four-headed monsters

[Verse 2: Akrobatik]
Yeah Plane Gang the team who you respect
We stay above the clouds like Preme, Guru and Deck
I brutalize you little guys that's new to the set
Unless you true to the vets, this is how crucial it gets
We giving hip-hop protection like the feudalist set
And in return all we ask is come through and respect
The message that the song is meant to give
I'm with my city's strongest representatives
Infinity bars how long we're meant to live
Immortal techniques, we're born to let our raps speak
You know how the story go, the ageless primordial
Champs you can't handle here
Dropping jewels on you like a chandelier
The quiet killer like a panda bear

[Verse 3: Edo G]
Plane Gang maintain the [?] bang
Gold chain gang, spit slang to spit game
Is whip flames with fangs, vampire shit here
Scary story campfire shit
You turnt up, I don't get that high
No style, SkyMiles, you don't get that fly
You a wildcard, you don't get that buy
I'm a stand up dude, you a sit down guy
Edo's the nigga for it, ill 16s with ill chorus
Giving rappers all rigarmortis
The hare against the tortoise, we restore this
Carry torches building a fortress

[Verse 4: Termanology]
Passport [?], Plane Gang T
First things first, free Wais the P-I-M-P
Thank God for my necklace
And thank God for giving me the heart to protect it, I'm reckless
Big tit grabber, big tip leaver
Bedroom bully, hotel trasher
Fuck 'em 'til they gasping like I ain't got asthma
Asperine gon' be needed after this trashing
Me, I'm on my second passport, the first one's a wrap
More stamps than the post office, stop it
Rolled up so high to the TSA
They said, "Where you flying, son?" I said, "up, up and away"

[Chorus]
Representing for the East Coast
Reks, Akrobatik, Edo G, Termanology
The grind don't stop, aim for the sky
The grind don't stop, aim for the sky

[Verse 5: Akrobatik]
Yeah, Eastern Standard Time got the people all standing in line
Just to see skills, I'm brandishing mine
All the knockoffs'll vanish in time
Over the banister, they fall short like Tyrian Lanister

[Verse 6: Reks]
Game of Thrones chance with the asswhooping for amateurs
In a foreign land with the band of lyrical bandits
A view that's a panoramic [?] nobody can handle us
We animals, the Eastern standard slang as the beat bang

[Verse 7: Edo G]
Edo, Termanology, my momma proud of me
Reks, Ak, them my dudes solemnly
Now follow me, my balls hang, no skinnys
Y'all stepping over dollars to make pennies

[Verse 8: Termanology]
I hit the stage with the greatest performers you ever seen
Army fatigues but you can never call me fatigued
You know the breath control is so cold
Follow the flow, that's why we the greatest that's unknown

[Chorus]
Representing for the East Coast
Reks, Akrobatik, Edo G, Termanology
The grind don't stop, aim for the sky
The grind don't stop, aim for the sky
Representing for the East Coast
Reks, Akrobatik, Edo G, Termanology
The grind don't stop, aim for the sky
The grind don't stop, aim for the sky
