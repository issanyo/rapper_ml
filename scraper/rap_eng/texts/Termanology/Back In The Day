[Verse One]
I'll rip your heart out
Try to put a hand on my squad
I'm in the Lord's house trying to put an end to my sins
And I be more 'bout, trying to take advantage of ours
You going raw in the whorehouse, you never can win
When I see the safe at the crib, I just want to fill it up
Never let my feelings decide on what's real enough
So who's killing stuff?
Since the radio is lovey dove
Y'all rapping for the club but can't fill 'em up
Huh
Conscious decision on your lifestyle
'Less you wanna live with no heat and with your lights out
Shit, y'all better off 9 to 5ing it
I've been rhyming since '95 and I survived in it
Somehow
I couldn't tell you but I followed it
Seen the yellow brick road, decided to travel it
Not arrogant, I'm just confident
So whether or not you acknowledge it I'm gon' body shit

[Hook] {x2}
Hey, you was a mack like that back in the day
All a sudden e'rybody got something to say
Acting like you show love but really it's hate
I'm just trying to get paid so stay out my way

[Verse Two]
Y'all stay hating
Walking up giving me daps
With fake smiles
Asking what number to dial
Like I'm gonna to give you my number and pick up my phone
To give you a loan
You gotta get that shit on your own
Till you travel where I travel
Struggle how I struggle
Hustle how I hustle
I ain't giving you shit
I done sacrificed my whole life for what I write
The blood, sweat, the tears, the crib with no lights
Not to mention the lice, the cockroaches and mice
The type of pain in my stomach for going hungry at night
And the nightmares I endure from being so poor
The bullets fly through my wall and through my window they crawl
And out my window they went with every dollar and cent
My mother hid in the vent that's why I be getting bent
It's memories I erase, with liquor with no chase
So fuck up outta my way and fuck up outta my face
I'm gone

[Hook]
