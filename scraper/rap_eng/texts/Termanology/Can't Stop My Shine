[Verse One][Krumb Snatcha]:
Back in '96 when my first joint dropped
My first goal was to hit the ball up out of the park
Primo laced the track and I provided the raps
It was the perfect rendition of I'm fuckin' with gats
Then one year further to the B.I.G. murder
Six months before, 'Pac popped by the burner
Been predicted, I only told a few
They wouldn't listen till I caught the Rap Quotable
Now the game is all static by the sound of automatics
When hip hop is dyin', then it's tragic
Came a long way since I Gotta Have It
When Edo was the first Boston cat with a classic
Needed MTV Raps, Ed Lover, Dr. Dre
Who would've thought he'd be rockin' each day
My up and comin' youngin' now takin' the reigns
With two legends and a mindset on changin' the game
Let's go

[Hook] [Termanology]:
Can't stop my shine, no way cause I'mma blow, I'mma blow
I'mma take it to the top
Just a matter of time, I'mma do my thing, my thing
ShowOff, ShowOff
Can't stop my shine, no way cause I'mma blow, I'mma blow
I'mma take it to the top
Just a matter of time, I'mma do my thing, my thing
S.T. dot

[Verse Two] [Termanology]:
Yo, back in '06 when my best shit dropped
Primo laced the beat, had the critics in shock
Term really tore down, Watch How It Go Down
Used to think he wouldn't blow but he gon' blow now
Been through some street shit, that I ain't peace with
Cats comin' through leavin' burners with my nieces
Krumb heard me spit, signed me right on the spot
Album never came out, went back to the block
Did what I had to do, blew up S.T. dot
Records, I'mma make it on my own, watch me pop
First LP dropped, didn't get a lot of scans
But I got a lot of press and I got a lot of fans
Funny how I stage dive now when they throw they hands up
When I jump in the crowd to hold me up
Ill cause I got that cream, give it to Preme
Me, Stat and then Green, a money makin' machine

[Hook] [Termanology]:
Can't stop my shine, no way cause I'mma blow, I'mma blow
I'mma take it to the top
Just a matter of time, I'mma do my thing, my thing
ShowOff, ShowOff
Can't stop my shine, no way cause I'mma blow, I'mma blow
I'mma take it to the top
Just a matter of time, I'mma do my thing, my thing
S.T. dot
