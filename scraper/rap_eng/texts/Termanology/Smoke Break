[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Should be on cover of the High Times
Walk in my closet, get SkyMiles, trap Einstein
Japanese, all them wontons
Gave her a D like Sean Don, told shorty quiet down
So many acres man, my kids can't trick or treat
Because them neighbors stay on a whole 'nother street
Politics as usual, I bought a suit for it
Puff got a party Friday, I bought a coupe for it
Who you know buy them bottles and don't drink
I sleep, fuck, shower in my gold link
Got Tity Boi tatted on her butt cheeks
If you don't pray for 7 days that make one weak

[Chorus]
Uh, let's take a smoke break
Got a 38 special, that hold 8
Got a room with marble floors and gold drapes
With a bad ass bitch that like to serve grapes

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Got a Wraith that I use for a bachelor pad
Still made all A's in back of the class
On the cover now, started from back of the mag'
Now it's back to the bag, got my happiness back
If I happen to brag?, it's accepted by the culture
Dunking, and 1, touch down vulture
This is exactly what happen mixing cocaine with soda
You get me and a Rollie, you get me, nigga hold it
This the crack vial chronicles, explore Nautica
Eddie Bauer Expo, AR silencer
Vibrant like the spring colors, rapping 'bout them teen murders
Rapping while I'm mean muggin', shouldn't get Supreme coverage

[Chorus]
Uh, let's take a smoke break
Got a 38 special, that hold 8
Got a room with marble floors and gold drapes
With a bad ass bitch that like to serve grapes
Yeah, let's take a smoke break
Got a 38 special, that hold 8
Got a room with marble floors and gold drapes
With a bad ass bitch that like to serve grapes
