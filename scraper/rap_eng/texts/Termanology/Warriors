Lookin at these brick buildings. Amongst poverty and pain. It's sick children. Bend a curb I see legendary niggas dealin. The hood crowned em street kings but they still diggin. For black gold. Another crack rock sold. But now I turn up my nose like will it ever get old. I don't know. Long as this burner sit on my lap and niggas still get ignorant I keep goin back. To the trappin the rachet hopin to dodge caskets. Still in the dodge lampin. So panoramic. So mannish. Thinkin I'll step it up a tad. Drop a few band cause 9th a new van for the fam. Blue shit. Man I'm on that new shit. Survive or die. And y'all stuck on stupid. Catch me on the fly. Hella fly still on lr gully life. Pray to Allah I don't got to see another night

Tryin to write an album bout a nigga in his housin. Leavin his lifestyle behind such an album. Willing to put it on the line what an album. In turn to get notice and thousands what an outcome. Leavin my past in my past like Malcolm's transition from Red. To minister X. Like the minute you decision was to end it or flex. Nigga I'm flexin. These crackers got they foot in my neck. They rather see me in my funerals best. My mother love to see me doin my best! Cause lord knows I don't like to see you stressed. You look a mess. I'm ramen noodles but a check away from better livin. Countin my reason for the safe every blessed minute. They night my soul cried out I still can't forget it. The same demon in the mirror still bares witness. But since I'm shining now them haters have impaired vision
