[Hook 1]
None of this is make believe

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Said I'm a rich nigga and this is for you bitch niggas
Bitch, said fuck the world and everything in it
Got foreigns in the driveway and ain't a thing rented
I drain the main vein in the mouth of main bitches
And lame niggas, stuck on pussies ?
I proceed to slip and fall in and out of them drawers
Rendezvous with these groupie broads, now I'm dodging their calls
Bet you wish you could be a fly up on my project walls
Serving clucks in my mama driveway started off with a ball, fa sho
The dope boy done graduated to the dope man
Got rich and flipped a rap career off 3 and a half grams
And ain't no nigga ever gave me shit
I paid the cost so fuck your boss, I work for FG, bitch
And it's the truth cause dick riding's at an all-time fucking high
So I stay solo, let this dolo blow my fucking mind
The razor blade major paid, quick to break a fiend
Taking all fades, none of this shit is make believe
Bitch

[Hook 2]
I said none of this shit is make believe

[Verse 2: Ea$y Money]
None of this is make believe
I can show you it all, the biggest doubter I can make believe
Listen to the jewels I'm spitting
The street shit is in my genes, homie, it's my true religion
Y'all really bore me on tracks
Sounding really corny on wax
Fronting like you really went to war or combat
You ignoring all facts
They done put me in a cell like you store your contacts
Rap niggas tell lies
Talk tough, but when the beef come, between their legs where their tail lies
ST do biz
Hold it down in any prison you sit us in, homie you're a citizen
Sold drugs like the pharmaceutic
The realest overall like a farmer suited
We the most official, we tote them pistols
And we got flows that's sick, too, come fuck with us

[Hook 2 with Statik Selektah]
That's what I'm saying though!
Your whole life's made up!
You're an author! Fictional!

[Verse 3: Termanology]
I take the trees, break the trees, shake the trees
Quarter pound, eighth of trees and (none of this is make believe)
I chased a cat down the block with a .38 special
He was speed walking, lucky he ain't see a coffin
I really put in work in them studios
Where them groupie hoes try and get loose and go out control
If I ? snuff ?
You ? hectic gun ?
I'm the muscle and the brain, seeing Russia on the plane is amazing
You should try to change your situation
Instagram scams and Twitter altercations
Facebook stalkers, y'all motherfuckas be hating
Detec's spying on me, ? get violent on me
Cliques stay wilding, homie, stick ? piling rollies
This rap life is real life all the time, my friend
It's "Ology," I'm known for getting it in
Plus...
