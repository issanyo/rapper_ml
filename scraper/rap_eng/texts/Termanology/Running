[Chorus]
Young or old, never fold, never catch me running
Following protocol and keeping the system running
Competition we gunning, your spot you better run it
So many years in the game but yet we still running
Young or old, never fold, never catch me running
Following protocol and keeping the system running
Competition we gunning, your spot you better run it
So many years in the game but yet we still running

[Verse 1]
Most important thing you got in this life is your health
Don't distort it or destroy acquiring wealth
It's like a storm around the corner just fire in hell
No more crying for help, now I rely on myself
I decided I felt enough pain, fuck shame
I'm still picking up sluts, fucking them in the mustang
Man I never trust a bitch cause these slut games
Play smut games, throw dirt in your shit like what name
The devil is evil, sometimes it come as your friend
But that's the one he sent to deceive you
Your eyes open enough, just for me to read through
Keep sneaking end up in Satan's bed with his people
I never mislead you, speaking you the truth to the end
In the church tears pouring again
I roll with the drug smugglers, hustlers and the G's
But still pour my heart out when it comes to these beats

[Chorus]
Young or old, never fold, never catch me running
Following protocol and keeping the system running
Competition we gunning, your spot you better run it
So many years in the game but yet we still running
Young or old, never fold, never catch me running
Following protocol and keeping the system running
Competition we gunning, your spot you better run it
So many years in the game but yet we still running

[Verse 2]
I hurt your feelings buddy, we working with silly money
You playing with silly putty, your nose is still putty
Pockets is real chubby, sort of like Checker
G your home wrecker, fuck up your home sector
Is she a bone inspector, you get the chrome Heckler
Just eat your dome flesh up, I'll give you stone pressure
We tryna raise bread up, my shit can raise the dead up
Twenty eight days later, zombie bullets take your face up
The nickel plate face up, Nicholas Cage your face off
Come in and knock your face off, my lawyer knock the case off
You better knock your shit off, Homie I knock your shit off
Five, Four, Three, Two, One, Zero rocket lift off
Come in your hit get lost, you cross the line get crossed
Nothing in line big boss, I flick your mind switch off
His whole line kick off, remember times in the North
Now bring it down to the south, and let 'em find shit out

[Chorus]
Young or old, never fold, never catch me running
Following protocol and keeping the system running
Competition we gunning, your spot you better run it
So many years in the game but yet we still running
Young or old, never fold, never catch me running
Following protocol and keeping the system running
Competition we gunning, your spot you better run it
So many years in the game but yet we still running

[Verse 3]
Put this dick in your bitch, but don't condonk
See me in the honkajonk, probably a pump in the trunk
Yah niggas pumps in the bump
MC Hammer ass nigga, your papers getting thin
Tell the truth, you ain't see me getting in, but I did it again
Major deals, Sony pub, entourage, ratchet Monday
Never had a hit, but shit nigga made a stack of money
I'm the definition of what legends should be
Is it me, nobody better than G and they never could be
You could not compare entertainer to an innovator
But his songs do not belong in the incinerator
It's like he Rakim's cousin, like he kin with Jada
But its no relation, his flow come with extended flavor
Hard work and dedication, like he Floyd boy
Hell nah, y'all ain't fucking with your boy boy
He went from Ill Street Blues, to spitting real street news
A real street dude, you might wanna avoid boy

[Chorus]
Young or old, never fold, never catch me running
Following protocol and keeping the system running
Competition we gunning, your spot you better run it
So many years in the game but yet we still running
Young or old, never fold, never catch me running
Following protocol and keeping the system running
Competition we gunning, your spot you better run it
So many years in the game but yet we still running
