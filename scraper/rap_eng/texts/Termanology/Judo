[Hook: Big Pun]
Judo know if I got a gun
Judo know if I got a gun
Judo know if I got a gun
Judo know if I got a gun
Judo know if I got a gun
Judo know if I got a gun
Judo know if I got a gun
Judo know if I got a gun

[Verse 1:Termanology]
I study judo, I be higher than Pluto, Juno
Numero uno, papi chulo but I got the chew, though
Gotta keep my ratchet inside my Chevy, Malibu, yo
You try to run up and get a come up you getting sumo
Oh man, my shorty sipping nuvo
Go catch a puno until you end up on telemundo
I got that puto, you tell everybody you know
What I get locked up for guns and drugs and see, that's it, who knows
I'm in Miami, Cubanos and Dominicanos ' sipping bottles with these models
You wanna follow, make sure you got some friends with you
They better be tens with you and don't bring no men with you
Ladies only and my telly after party cause fathers be acting rotty
And my luck may catch up on me
Molly all up in your sister and you twisted, don't be a victim
Homie, listen, I'm tryna relax and kick it with my clique and plus

[Hook]

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E]
Still I keep a scully cap, kick gully rap
You look for me, you find me where the money at
Or around some Goya beans, left rack, that's the Puerto Rican side of Queens
They call me papi, I shoot niggas, they don't pop me, I got truce, nigga
I throw acid on your eyelids then I piss on your eyes, call it eye piss
You use to stash change in the ' then I rob niggas when they hit Shea Stadium
That was a stickup genius, lights, ass, tongue and a long ass penis
So the bitch thought fucking with me
I got a deal then they all started sucking me
Designer belts round my waist line, I get head off top, I don't waste time

[Hook]
