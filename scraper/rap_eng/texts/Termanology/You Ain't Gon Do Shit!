[Intro:]
Jerk fuse
[Audio Sample - Kevin Hart]
You ain't go do shit!
Niggaa
You ain’t go do shit
You ain’t go do it
You ain’t go do shit
You ain’t go do it
You ain’t go do shit
You ain’t go do it

[Verse 1:]
Cause the blocka don’t change
And I’m rocking my J’s
And I’m poppin that Kay
Gotta drop of that sway
Mike outta ma face
Look at that
At the scale that we at
We goin make a hundred plays
Put the weed in the bag
We got that blue cheese
I took these 2gs
Turned them to a few gs
Go and look at my ice
Got a hammer got a knife
But I rip this center up one time
Your life
Betta get this shit right
Clips don’t go off in the middle night
It’s a challenge not to get blood on ma New Balance
My whole crew violent
Freddy Krueger dude be wildin’
We wid some Dukes of Hazzard
Rolling wid some Nubian things
Is on our face
Dutch lace
Bed lookin white as Santa
And its from that work
Gotta double that perk
What’s under that skirt
Girl show me what worth
I come from that dirt
Where the guns go bezerk
Dealers come thru in [?]
Tryna fuck around and flirt
With that
You’d be comfy in the casket I built
Lest you passing me bills
No way I’m rappin for real
It’s bomb threat
Faml ST double scholars
Watch me take them to church
Then we hit em where it hurt

[Chorus:]
We live in hard times
Homie it’s a recession
My mind blocked
We don’t leave without the Smith n Wesson
Go’on pop the trunk
Show you my little buddy
Betta keep it all smiles
Cause things could get ugly
Said we ready
Yea we ready
Said we ready for the dope
Homie you better be ready
Cause them things we let em go
We let em go[x8]

[Verse 2:]
Yeah
Ready
Big steel in my lap like strippers
Bullets cut a nigga head like clippers
Got a hundred rounds on pig killa
Like quick pull the trigga
Betta ya mama go’n miss ya
Wish a nigga would try me
Two shots bang bang
D-I-E
Slow nigga
Do a ho nigga
Triple 8 show you 4 mo’ nigga
357 that’s hammer time
First 48 that’s camera time
Gotta wife beat on she camera shy
Canon in my hand I’m a camera guy
Big gun on waist
I wear that bitch just like my father would
Cause I’m gettin money so I keep that kay for haters having none
Full clip for that bullshit
Cause that bullshit you get no play
Pull the trigger back
Put it to a nigga head
Then get a nigga scalp like
You don’t play
That’s D-O-A
Dead on arrival
Put him in a box
Tell the doc can’t save em
Kick his ass to the ground
Then throw him in the dirt
Cause it hurt
Now the doc can’t save em

[Chorus]
