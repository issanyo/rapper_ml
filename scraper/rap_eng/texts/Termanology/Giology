[Verse]
You ain't hip
I roll with the most thorough stone throwers
Without sin, look in the mirror, we toast lovers
Stone cold, bury the bones under your home
And then it's fuck the undercovers
Crime boss since the montage, the God laws
Need players from all law
All our sins amount to a mountain of shame
I fill my cup with a sip from the fountain of fame
Now I'm here shower in pain
Surrounded by the shallow minded savages lames
Pawns in this real life chess game
Shall I test aim or just let it bang
Bang

Leave the empty suicide note
Use your imagination for this revelation
I do a one-on-on with Satan
My mind's on drugs, it's still baking
The rider says Hennesey, beer and no bacon
Provided that we in a sober state, no raging
Cause me, I start blazing and poisoning the liver
Then I flip, turn into a psychopath killer
You ain't got no Advil, fuck it, pass me a Perc
I'm popping these pussy boys and place 'em in the dirt
Wave you while I'm in the church
My blood's still boiling from last night
I swear I was an angel in my past life
