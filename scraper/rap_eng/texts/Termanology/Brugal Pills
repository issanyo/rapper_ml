[Intro:]
You put the pills in the Brugal
And then you drink it

[Verse 1:]
To keep it real all I do is get high and get loot
Ya'll be talkin bout you ballin dog, where's the proof?
I chop bricks and make the pot of gold poof
And disappear like my convertible roof
I fertilize weed plants and pussies with my juice
Utilize to scrutinize guys from my youth
That poor thing to men, ST, we 9 troups
Blood brothers that learned to take cover when they shoot
I be having dreams with bad nightmares in em
Police hoping out, blue rentals with blue medals
That blue steel, tryna get them new medals
For shootin another spick a black kid in the head
Watch the bloodshed, a stain, a dirty pay
From they wicked ways, that's how they keep us afraid
A pig kills you, they throw yo ass in the grave
But if you kill them they give his ass a parade
Let the guns play, fuck it let's all die
AK's Mack 10's, 9's and 45's
If being wise is better than being live
While the good die young and the fowl is still alive
The crystal ball couldn't even tell you the truth
That's why I sip liquor, no matter the proof
My stomach lookin like the fiery gates to sin hell
And they stay burnin but it feels good as hell

[Hook: x2]
Brugal Pills, I said Brugal Pills
Take a couple pills, crush em up in the ale
Sip a little liquor, take a couple more pills
Now tell me how you feel, tell me how you feel

[Verse 2:]
Ayo the truth is you don't wanna know the truth
If you knew the way I live my life you'd probably puke
I live righteous mixed with leanitrous
Grab the lighters, light a candle then snipe ya
I'm confused, learning these gun rules
Do I shoot? Keep it on safety or abuse?
My enemies, fake thug celebrities
And back stabbing birdies out for my cheese
Best prepare cause if it's Tech just fled
You gon look like you just met the electric chair
Jump up, hopping out my Lexus chair
Eat your food, finish up my breakfast
I got money in my pocket but it don't mean shit
'Cause money can't save you from a bullet splittin yo wig
Your money can't save you from a stray or catching aids
Or catching a blade deep in yo heart, stopping yo day
Red light, green light, ambulances is dancing through traffic
Tryna save yo ass, I'm Satan takin you ransom
And you were handsome, at least that's what yo mama said
Now you in deep shit like Osama had
Get you fun close range, leave the lama red
I'm a scummer head, piff blowin ganja head
I wouldn't trust that bitch so she a bubble head
Probably go to the church and give the father head

[Hook: x2]
Brugal Pills, I said Brugal Pills
Take a couple pills, crush em up in the ale
Sip a little liquor, take a couple more pills
Now tell me how you feel, tell me how you feel

[Outro:]
Yea, shout out all my Dominicans, all my Puerto Ricans
Everybody on that Brugal
We getting drunk in here ya'll
ST dot, come on
