[Verse 1: Termanology]
I'm fresh in the photos, Polos in the logo
If the show's for a promo then it's a no go
Fresh like a motherfucker clean in the Avatar
And my weed look like a salad bar
Red soles on the suede Pat Ewings
Give me a bird I'll show you why it go two wings
Twenty-two pair of Js, I stay in Versace shades
Fendi suitcase, my closet look like a Dr. Js
Funny how I got ice on this hot bezel
Your shit cool but it ain't Ralph level
Little Nautica boats all on the comforter
My new coat and my coke both from Colombia
I'm trying to get paid 'cause I got a true talent
And lift my bank account to a new balance
Let's have a converse conversation
I'ma continue to clown, call it determination
Your imagination tells you you may be able to see me
But I'm Jordan and you D-League
And these ain't out for three weeks
The neck breaker, the check maker, I'm so fresh
These porn stars and models hitting the text

[Hook: Dutch ReBelle]
Photo shoot fresh
Photo shoot fresh
I'm 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
(x4)

[Verse 2: Wais]
Fresh in my Guiseppes three quarter [?]
Niggas hatin' on my whips like I'm the boss of the plantation
Gold famin', gold chainin'
Suede Kangol Dana Danin'
I'm M-1 aiming, fuck slaving over concrete paving
You lames is hoe saving while I'm point shaving
Gambling, hot money in the Caymens
Chick'll bring a nigga a bitch say when
A-men, eh man do the knowledge of that
Three quarter million house I ain't need college for that
Push the pedal on the Porsche, pop a bottle for that
Champagne on my dick, bitches swallowing that
Fresher than Dapper Dan, how the fuck is that possible
I'm fly but on land how the fuck is that logical
Being broke is a joke but ain't shit comical
My [?] down to my hair folicle

[Verse 3: Dutch ReBelle]
Tell the paparazzi pucker up and kiss my Pucci
Always pick the Prada over Gucci
Photo bombing bitches like a general, salute me
Fresher than a summer rain, hot like a jacuzzi
Kept them wild kingdoms on the kicks
Yeah them Supras had them suped up
Bucket hat low, don't get Karmaloop'd up
Cooped up with a Jordan conoseur type
You the bottom of the jean dragging on the floor type
Now tell me, how you Tommy Hilfiger that
All these high tops I copped bitches still sick of that
They ain't Gloria Vanderbuilt like me
Used to rock B.C.B. jeans, heels with a tall white tee
Fuck a trendsetter, there's really no comparing us
Came through crisp fresher than asparagus
Painted like a sketcher but need checks 'cause she knew better
Dutch been fresher than a fitted, I'm a New Era
