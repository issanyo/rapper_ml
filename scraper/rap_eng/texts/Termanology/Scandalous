[Intro]
[Man talking] There's nothing familiar about the way they talk...or look. Or even the way they worship their creator. They may be American but they're....they're not like you at all
[Woman talking] We made a wild and wonderful record for you
[Man talking] We tell you all kinds of things to do and be and you can let your imagination go

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse One: Termanology]
You better recognize
I don't give a fuck about a record deal, I wreck you guys
Plus I specialize in murking you out with special knives
Tec's and nines, next in line
Who wanna get it, I known to spit it with the best alive
I murder stages and murder pages like murder cases
Rip out your vertebrates and your brain with my dirty razors
I went to thirty mages invaded 'em with my lasers
Told 'em about it this independent gun that I'm blazing
Fuck a record deal
For the record I've been living wreckless
I'll clutch your diamond necklace off your neck and I'll flex it
Then I fled to the exit, I hope you catching the message
I got a necklace the size of Tretch's just to wreck ya flesh with
We straight scandalous, handing out brain damages
Cats pulling banana clips
Vast bullets and bandages
The brain is Goya me patna now you wanna cop?
Unless you cop
Then it's 1-800-COP-SHOT

[Verse Two: Chris Rivers]
Ain't nothing humorous
Crucifix ya ludicrous movement
I'm way too lucrative, I move with this translucent improvement
Only the light can pass, lightening fast
By the time you can wipe ya ass
Need to calculate infinity to fathom the mic's I grasp
Your mind relapse
Perhaps, from the way that I write these raps
The attack I blaze each track with the force of a 1,000 stars collapsed
Novas and quasars
Soldier and eight bars
Sixteen I'm Elohim, nebulous status, I make stars
I stay charged
Ripping the force out of black holes
You don't get my space reference
Suck a corpse out an asshole
You dumb fuck
I guess you should've died as a tadpole
But since you're here now, go hang yourself on a flagpole
I'm joking
I'm all about that peace and equality
Preaching philosophy
Word to law for reading astrology
Leading this odyssey journey from the depths that I constantly turn in
Democracy, logically and fuck this economy
