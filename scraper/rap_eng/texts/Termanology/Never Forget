Uhh-huhh
[Verse 1: Ransom]
Gon' tell you what life about
I used to fuck with them niggas, they'll wipe you out
Repeatedly strikin' out
They need to get diapers out
Them shit's a bitch
My daughter grown but still I know I ain't shit
I'm used to loadin' the clip but recently be reformed
Squeezing ones in my palm, you leave it cus you've been warned
That's when it's gone, I put this shit on my mom
Them niggas talkin' shit, then I shoot this bitch on the lawn
Pardon me, but I was living in poverty
A part of me got visions of playing Carnegie
But honestly I'm just a crook in the ghetto
I put my foot on the pedal cuz I ain't lookin' to settle
Huh, me and Term make niggas burn
Just like the firm, niggas will learn, court is adjourned
Slam the gavel, convicted, niggas conflicted
I'm cryptic with this lyrical fitness you witness
You lipstick, that means you softer than butter
I'll put the hawk in yo mother if you ain't start from the gutter
Huh, y'all niggas talkin' and stutter
Nervous with no purpose, I surface like no other

[Verse 2: Termanology]
Yo! Im in the jects making checks off Mexican connects
Put the darts out the dart board and stab you in the neck
You know me as the little young' that'll spit a lung in yo mothers face and then bust a nut inside yo baby mother
I'm a Mercedes lover, also I'm a crazy brother
I smother yo baby and throw 'em inside the flaming covers
Wrap 'em up inside a Polo sheet
At least he died in style, man he could've died with penis on his feet
But y'all shall honor me, lyrically I am honestly
100 thousand feet, I'm beyond these rappers thats on TV
In this economy fuck it, I'd rather some narcotics
I put a product out and watch them fiends go demonic
They turnin' zombies off molly, coke and amphetamine
Adrenaline rushes turnin' inta medicine, it's devilish
Don't talk shit if you got a jaw that's delicate
She's spreading it for everyone while you putting yo head in it
I get on these tracks and I ain't gotta be competitive
I'm selective, one more I'm messin' with, plus I'm the best at this
I'm like the exorcist, makin' bitches turn they head like a hour, the power of money will make them bow
And allow anything to go down, man I'll picture in my foulest visions
That'll be nightmares inside they daddy's dreams
I drink liquor like LeBron drink Gatorade
Just give me a razor blade, I'm finna get paid today

[Verse 3: Ransom]
I shoot and fade away, Jordan style was born a while
Record the corner, I bought my daughter a doll McDowell
Im sorta fowl, turn static, important foul
I told you I'm sorta wild, I'll even extort a child
I'm physically gifted and lyrically lifitin' yo spirits
Can live the way you play this miracle and you say that guy
Really live it, already did it
I bring these lyrics to life, just gotta spit it
