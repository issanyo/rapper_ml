[Hook: Cyrus DeShield]
Love, love, love
Love can make you act so crazy
Love can make you act so crazy, baby
Love, love, love
Love can make you do some crazy thangs
Some crazy, crazy,crazy thangs

[Verse 1: Termanology]
Ugh, woke up stressed, two hundred texts
Now both of us vexed, and it’s a mess
Every other convo, somethin’ bout my ex
Should we just put this relationship to a rest?
I mean it’s common sense, time and time again
We stay in the same struggle that we shouldn’t be in
Like, where should I begin?, should I leave again?
My ex did me dirty, so now I just need a friend
Pop a couple bottles so I could try to fit in
I don’t really wanna party but I could try to pretend
I know she lying again, flippin’ crying again
The feeling is so distant, it’s different I really miss her
Overcome by the feelin’ that you could do better
You post a IG pic, type out a whole letter
This is the last time I swear I mean never
Like never never again but, but never say never cuz..

[Verse 2: Termanology]
You know the feeling you get? Your chest get tight
Somebody took you for granted, messed up your whole night
You knew something was off, the feeling ain’t right
And you ain’t tryna hear shit so you text the whole fight
Next day you wake up, here comes the break up
Your heart shattered to pieces now you wanna make up
Calls and texts, they ring in but more or less
It’s seems all the same, we lost all respect
I used to say I love you, now I say fuck you
Funny I would’ve let ‘em kill me before they touch you
And I don’t even trust you, I’m missin’ the days I did
Back when was cooped up, lazy in the crib
How it go from, “Bae I love you and I miss you"
To “Bitch you ain’t shit" and “Man I wish I could hit you”
Way too many issues, tears dripping in tissues
Even through all this, I still wish I was with you cuz..

[Bridge: Cyrus DeShield]
I say do you love me or do you love me not?
It’s always something girl, we gon’ blow up the spot
And I’m talking about blowing up forreal
We gon’ need a fireman to cool the fire down
Awe man
I can't fight it
I won't like it
If you said it was over right now
I be in ya face with this, I couldn’t lye down
I’m more than crazy for ya love, I'm grateful for ya love
And if we lacking patience, there’s no us
I know that ain’t enough
But we be goin’ back and forth like we don’t give a flyin’ fuck about how we feeling
Tryna hurt each other’s feelings
When I know that you love me anyway, I love you just the same
So baby I ain't going no where
