[Verse 1: Termanology]
The record label killer
Burn into they lying mouth
Let me see them royalties ‘fore you see what I’m about
Before you go and shake my hand, go and shake that check book
To me them lies and tricks you play is all text book
I can get your neck shook, cracked out of place
And won’t be no judge, no courts and no case
And since you two-face, you can get your face split
Crack your teeth, dip ‘em in gold and make a bracelet
I used to get wasted and hang with my so called
“Ride or Die” click, now I don’t even know ya’ll
Read it in the bible, friends turn Judas
How could I be exempt, why was I so clueless?
Hanging ‘round losers, pawns and evil doers
Left me in the cesspool, drowning in the sewers
Had to make maneuvers
Chop off the snake heads
Lay your ass down, so bitch you better play dead

[Hook: Jared Evan]
They say all dogs go to heaven
But all the snakes they lay in the grass
Come to my town it’s made of legends
We can sniff you out
All you snakes are asking for it

[Verse 2: Slaine]
Look, I’m trying to keep my eyes wide open nowadays
And keep in mind that these snakes can be subtle
Cause many tried to disguise little power plays
And not get [size from a lake to a puddle?]
Me I’m still feeling like the Great Lake Michigan
The late great Rocky Marciano throwing fists again
To make a clean break and escape it takes discipline
Ya’ll making moves from my cake ya ain’t listening
I been the right [bone?] in this game since I got in it
Had that ice cold in my veins more than a hot minute
I out-maneuvered all you liars and thieves
And dodge a couple bullets, I refuse to die in the streets
Seen many come and go with no retiring speech
You ain’t getting rid of me at least ’til I am deceased
Rest in peace to the weak ones, where I am the beast
There’s a line in you hoes longer than the fireman’s reach
And that’s real

[Hook: Jared Evan]
They say all dogs go to heaven
But all the snakes they lay in the grass
Come to my town it’s made of legends
We can sniff you out
All you snakes are asking for it

[Verse 3: Sick Jacken]
I got seven kids at home, and knee deep in the mistress
Scumbag shit, and I keep failing piss tests
Fans say they love me, but they bootleg it instead? [?]
I do this shit for me man that’s why I never miss rep
Trying to make my money legal so the feds don’t inspect
Stayed hungry all this time, you can do a rib check
Came from the era that died for Yogi Berra
PTSD from the Pico Union terror
I never walk with killers that didn’t hug their mama
That’s how I knew they had my back and plug all the drama
While the bullets cause trauma, I was schoolin’ as a rhyma' [?]
It was cool, cause I'm kinda like a voice for all the bombers
In the LA, comma C.A, you don’t get a second chance
Flagrant acts come with no replay
I could care less about the he say she say
I stay tuned in on what the dope MCs lay

[Hook: Jared Evan]
They say all dogs go to heaven
But all the snakes they lay in the grass
Come to my town it’s made of legends
We can sniff you out
All you snakes are asking for it
