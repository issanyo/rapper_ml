[Hook: Kanye West (Scratched)]
Like we always do at this time

[Verse 1: Michael Christmas]
I said squaaaaad the fuck up
Hit my nigga [?], tell him pull the truck up
Finna fuck that bitch that said I couldn't do it, actin' stuck up
My niggas put the drugs up, we used to put our lunch up
Bettin' on the Pokémon battle or wrestling matches
Foggy glasses, I step off the stage, proceed to laugh
How I get this far? Give a year, how you get this cough?
Seventh grade, how you get them bars?
I am confused, I hate these dudes that ask questions
Leather pants kickin' birds out feather vans
Watch quadruple Ks, Keenan, Kel and Kim Kardashian
And fucked her man, and fuck your fans, and fuck your friends
I'm with some old bitches tryna fuck again
Cause I'm a different nigga, I got a different plan
Tomorrow never promised me nothin' but bein' broke
And all I ever wanted was extra sleep and some dome

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Astro]
While y'all fad follow, I'm tryna up my dough
Such a star, I'd probably get boo'd at the Apollo
I spit sick swallow, then dro'd up
I know when you know I'm pullin' cards like Uno
Crew so real that we ain't gotta deal
Long as the block think it's hot then we got mass appeal
Put a fork in the pitch and if y'all ain't with it, we ain't bitchin'
Some only feel the heat when it's money in the kitchen
Rippin' tracks like it's for my freedom
The don, what you thought, y'all could beat him?
If rap's a sport, I [?] like Derülo
Sharp like a vato, lines over your culo
I kick shit 'til the flavor is good
Y'all spit rich shit but still live in the hood
I don't own leather pants, never dance
The Nae Nae's a no no, I might hit the Shmoney on the low though

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Termanology]
It's the sultan, sittin' on the throne made of diamonds
Polyester robe with the linen in the linin'
Gold microphone trap the words I'm designin'
Your girl give emoji red hearts when I'm rhymin'
Helicopter rise with my Js swingin' in the wind
If I'ma make it rain, it's for the kids in the tenements
We givin' out turkeys in the winter
Rap Robin Hood, make sure every lil' kid get a dinner
The Mustang peel out, smoke like 9-11
Rhymin' legend, time again and time again the comp is shredded
Feelin' like Kane in '87, the greatest ever
Grew up in the '90s, to me that was the greatest era
Give me a mic, some turntables and some speakers
For me it's like a fully packed church to the preacher
Knowledge reigns supreme, 'Ology the new teacher
And I brought some new killers with me rhymin' on the features
Jesus

[Hook]
