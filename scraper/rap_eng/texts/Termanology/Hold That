[Verse One]:
Ayo, to whom it may concern I ain't tryin' to offend ya
But I'm somethin' like Eminem and Pun mixed in the blender
Cause I'm half spic, half white plus I rep rap right
Plus I live the fast life, plus I'm just that nice
Now
You can have your own opinion
Try to throw dirt on my name like a meridian
Try to punk me out of my shit like I'm an Indian
But Term stay swingin' the bats like Dominican
Nah
I never did hard time
But I pick hard beats and I write hard rhymes
And I moved hard white right before I got signed
So I treated every track like a race against time
I'm, livin' for the rhyme, not livin' for the lime light
The longevity and lyricism is a long flight
Get ready for the all night shoot outs and bar fights
A couple cats on site you could bet I would make 'em

[Hook]:
Hold that
Said I'll never make it on the mic
Six months later I was in the Unsigned Hype
I told 'em hold that
They said I couldn't sell
Six months later I was in the XXL
I made 'em hold that
Like when I beat my case
I told the punk police "Fuck you" to they face
I made 'em hold that
I'm here to keep it alive
Like KRS said, I knew hip hop would never die

[Verse Two]:
Yo '88 to '99, man what a crazy time
Razor sharp blazin' rhymes
Now it's all the same design
Wack lyrics, catchy hook, posin' with a sketchy hook
Rappers threw away their Timbs now they want the sexy look
Damn
Well if that's the case B
I guess I'm Kanye, pass that "versece"
I know my bitch baby momma tryin' to erase me
I'm on TV everyday so you still gotta face me
Momma hold that
Now back to my beats
Ain't another rapper in the world rappin' like T
Still these funny ass promoters think I'm rappin' for free
Well I ain't rappin' at your show if you ain't passin' me G's
My nigga hold that
Still I do it for the love
Love hip hop, love rippin' mics and love guns
Never run, never hold mine tongue and hold back
Shoot the ones with anybody and tell 'em to hold that

[Hook]:
Hold that
Said I'll never make it on the mic
Six months later I was in the Unsigned Hype
I told 'em hold that
They said I couldn't sell
Six months later I was in the XXL
I made 'em hold that
Like when I beat my case
I told the punk police "Fuck you" to they face
I made 'em hold that
I'm here to keep it alive
Like KRS said, I knew hip hop would never die

Hold that
