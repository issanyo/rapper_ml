[Intro]
Gotta get up, book that flight
About to hit that tour
Gotta get this money baby

[Hook]
Oh baby, please don't go, please
Baby please don't go, please don't go
Oh baby, please don't go, please
Baby please don't go

[Verse 1]
My Murder Mass chick tell me 'Term don't go'
I say, 'here's a little cash, go burn that dough'
We in the hood ma, but I'm tryna take you out of that
It's big bread in the game, and I'm the part of that
I'm trying to get this big money for shizee
I be gone till November on the tour and its legal
And I'm gone, gone, go smile, give me a toast
Put your glass in the air and shh?, I'm out of here
I know you love the way that I be breakin' your back
But when we in the sack I ain't makin' no stacks
And I ain't the type to sit around, broke for nothin'
My ma, I'd rather have you swingin' on the pole or somethin'
Can't you, see my vision, the cream, the winnin', the gleam, the leanin'
I had to make a mean decision
It's either, sit around the hood, broke with a ho
Or bounce on the tour bus, mind focused on dough
I'm out

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My VA chick tell me 'please don't leave'
She trying to hide my keys on me when I'm puttin' on my jeans
I told her 'chill ma, I promise I'ma keep it real ma'
You know I have my fingers crossed on a real yo
I can't see myself tied down yet
I want a Bentley and a Benz, and a fly Corvette
And there ain't no other way to get it, but on the road
When I come back from tour, hit you off with a rose
Maybe a ring, nah, never a ring
But when I pass through the hood you know I give you a ring
I ain't trying to be foul, just trying to be rich
Trying to be up in the six with the ST Click
Listen to this, you hear, I be right there
That's a million dollar sound, we trying to keep that there
What use in droppin' a single if it ain't number one
I got 99 problems but you just ain't one
Sorry ma

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My NY chick tell me 'Term come back'
But she no speakin' English, she trying to learn all that
I told her yo me voy, mammy, I mean I'm leavin'
I be back in ATL by the end of the weekend
Back down in Miami by the first of the month
I bought you a phone so you ain't gotta curse at me once
Just hit me on the jack, shorty leave me a message
I promise that I holla at you before I hit Texas
You gotta understand the game I'm in
I'm trying to get this money, you tryna cage me in
I can't be locked, baby girl I can't be stopped
Being in the same hood for one day is a lot
It's different things seein' different area codes
Picture Term trying to settle down and marry a ho
While I'm here, relax and just kick it
Cause when I roll out, know it's a one way ticket
I'm gone

[Hook]
