[Intro:]
AE on the track
Handcuffs Hand cuffs
Handcuffs Hand cuffs

[Chorus:]
These niggas can't stand us
So they want us in handcuffs
When you get that power feel like Tony Montana
Denise [?] starring [?]
They want me in handcuffs
Why they want me in handcuffs
Take me out these handcuffs
I like to eat Salmons I can't be in handcuffs
Handcuffs handcuffs

[Verse 1:]
Just dropped open a Phantom
Got 30 on ma handgun
Ma cousin name Santana got work from Alabama
No niggas no [?] them
Let ma niggas out them handcuffs
Streets getting dry like Canada
Feds got me on camera
I can't be in handcuffs
Nah i'm saying tho
Uh uh in handcuffs
Uh uh you ain't a man bro
You tryna get me jammed up
You want see me in handcuffs
Boy that's fucked up

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I don't wanna be famous, these niggas done changed up
They thought that I would change on em
Started dropping names out that shit ain't gangster
I thought we all was gangsters
When you get that power feel like Tony Montana
Denise [?] starring [?]
They done lock all of ma mans up
I know they tryna get me am the last man standing
But I ain't playing staying in ma lane cause

[Chorus]
