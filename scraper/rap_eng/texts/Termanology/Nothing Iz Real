[Intro: Termanology]
Yea! And well
Termanology [?]
Nothing is real
This whole rap game
Shit is all fake
Whack rappers and whack bitches
And these fake politicians, yo!

[Verse 1: Termanology]
So what's the deal, There's nothing that's real
It's all appearance
Which is what they call spirits
Casting spells on the realist
Hookers be catching feelings
And feeling like you the menace
All up in your business, trying to be fussy and jealous
I learned myself, don’t trust no one else
Especially when she tell you there ain't nobody else
Because she prolly tell, everyone she meet that
It's just a way to keep your best trust and believe that
If your perceived as a person that they see whack
And everybody know you lie about your D pass
That you a sucka, and mothafuckas can see that
Part of the reason I'm bringing your LP back
Rap dudes, fake bitches, and politicians
They all the same, they turn snake for minor digits
If you don’t mind a [?] your life could all be a fiction
No story and wind up on a list that shits kind of fitting

[Chorus: Zero 7]
Do you believe?
In what you see? (I don’t believe that)
Motionless wheel (I don’t believe that)
Nothing is real (I don’t believe that)

Do you believe?
In what you see? (I don’t believe that)
Motionless wheel (I don’t believe that)
Nothing is real (Nothing is real)

[Verse 2: Termanology]
And as for these rappers
None of this shit is real
Cars rented jewels rented
They borrow and steal
50 percent of rappers still living back at moms
20 percent of rappers still living behind bars
90 percent of rappers is broke and never blow
The other 10 are real
They hustle and slang coke
It's all a big hoax
Most rappers have big hopes
But never see big doe
It's all a big joke
Tears on they face
But they ain't killing nothing
Trying to make you scared
Like niggas is real or something
This ain't a horror movie
But it's just as fake
Though its horrific when you think of the musical state
No Pumas and breaks
Emcees moving to place
Just dudes that are fake
Trying to be cool that they ain't
You abusing this great
Music with tunes you create
Studio goons into place
Wish I can shoot at your face

[Chorus: Zero 7]

[Verse 3 - Termanology]
Ayo taxes
Why you think there's different kind of brackets
Some people get money
And put it under they mattress
Some people are funny
Like they rich and they above me
But I'm laughing at these yuppies
Like Pac spitting at cameras
Looking at my people's eyes
Struggling to beat the odds
These politicians buy new stations and camera time
Fox News, CNN, and Channel 5
They all telling lies
Whatever they fantasize
I look into the eyes
Of these politicians
Take advantage of our women
Keep em standing in positions
Where they pay for babysitting
Trying to make a living
But it costs so much
To go to school they never finish
You can say it's all a business
Or the government is tripping
But If we don’t wanna listen
There's no way that we could switch it
I could see all this vivid shit
That some people are missing
Homie, don’t you get it twisted
None of this shit is real

None of this shit is real
