[Intro:]
Ladies & gentlemen
This is
Statik Selektah
The remix
Oh here we go, here we go, come on, come on
Oh here we go

[Hook:]
I'm up every night, losing sleep
Every midnight
Every night

[Verse 1:]
You know me, I love the ladies, I'm chilling in my Mercedes
We kicking and getting faded, with piff all up in my papers
Right now on my limonaded, finished, molly taken
And the Shawty gave me head so I left er decapitated
I exaggerated when I laid er down and I made it
Turned into a situation, that was amazing so I blaze it
Then I dipped cause the house party was weird and it was filled up with drugs
And more entertainment than Las Vegas
See me? I get drunk and I don't give a fuck
I be actin like I do but I do this shit every month
When I step up in the party it's all pounds and hugs
And pounds of love, you down, let's round em up
Cause up every night, getting drunker then right
And I used em all so it ain't a rubber in sight
If Corey got the Gunz and Term got the funs and Kid got the Ink we gon call it a night
Let's go

[Hook: x2]
I'm up every night losing sleep
Every midnight
Every night

[Verse 2:]
They told me I'm on tarot tar for seeing packed cigars, playing with acid jars
Swinging yo ass a scar, isn't that bizarre?
What these tactics are, for the cash at ya'll
I ain't stuck on repeat, now duck on the creek
Fuck I want with some cheeks, I be fuckin the beats
Been here so long when ya'll was nothing to lease
You niggas is nuts thinkin you fuckin with me, pause
Drink no chase, Henny up to the lean
Mob the ego, here we go, we have conducted a fiend
Truthfully, I seen my dangerous song as my right
Truthfully sayin my dangerous arms on the right
I mean I be talkin fly, I'm bout as boom as a fly
You going numb on the vibe, I'm bout as calm as a fight
You niggas whack, you niggas make my mama look nice
And that's nothing to do with my mama, look like alright

[Hook: x2]
I'm up every night losing sleep
Every midnight
Every night

[Bridge:]
It's driving me out of my mind
That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get her out of my head
Kiss her, diss her

[Verse 3:]
Just kiddin, you can tell em that game up all night
Showin up late for the time of my life
With the time in his right, the lames to the left
Say they fresh to death, see me fresh in the flesh
Liver than S&L
Blunts in the air, we don't roll no L's
Close to a win, we don't know no L's
Swimming in the money, why you niggas slow sell
Alumni bitch, we the A team
Bout to make a movie, back on the scene like
Uh, wuddup ho?
I just wanna ball, steady pick and roll
Keep it G but I'm feelin like a D
All the above, everything's on me
I told you before, you ain't gotta leave
Tryna stay up like it's Christmas Eve

[Hook: x2]
I'm up every night losing sleep
Every midnight
Every night

[Outro:]
Oh here we go, here we go, come on, come on
Oh here we go, here we go, come on, come on
Oh here we go, here we go, come on, come on
Oh here we go
