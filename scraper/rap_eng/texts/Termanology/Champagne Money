[Verse 1:]
Shawty step in the club, with her chest all popping out
Red lipstick, red dress and red bottoms on
She go to college but she bartend
Stay attracted to hustlers and cars man
Tryina find a way out, but willing to wail out
Cause she ain't figured it out yet
She got a little red dress, so fuck being depressed
She rockin that new outfit
Got your mind all stuck, but her mind know on buck
She looking for new outlets
But you can have her if you want, just treat her like a stunt
Right after you done stunting
It's all about the money maine
You could be an ugly maine, but you carry 20 grand
So of course you get love and ladies are rolling up
And willing to do anything
Cause they need their rend paid
And you willin to make it rain, while spillin your champagne
And she willing to change her name to whatever yours is
As long as she get a portion
And ladies got you on the radar
They wanna start you a quasar
But I'd rather be a common by far
Sippin dom at the bar, throwin and peelin off

[Bridge:]
That's why I got my shades on low
Even though it's dark, cause I ain't fuckin with y'all
That's why I got my shades on low
Even though it's dark, cause I ain't fuckin with y'all

[Hook:]
I can see, bitch you ain't fooling me, no
I know just what is on your mind
Fronting like you want me, popping bottles spending money
Girl stop wasting my time

[Verse 2:]
She love Moet, Rose and Chardonnay
But drink men alike, before you came in her life
Stomach feel tight, move feels right
Ass is ginormous, fellows is all on it
She got a body like Marilyn, lookin for a rich ass thug to play gentleman
You know the club full of tree and codeine mountains
And ballers make champagne fountains
Looking for that fountain of youth
In her birthday suit, in the next man coup
See me I tell you the truth
Like Paul Peers publicist
Mamies be in the club but this atitude on some other shit
Don't trick never will, won't sip, won't kill, go head take a sip
But this ain't no crystal, it's a 40 year bush and a whiskey nip, sorry

[Hook:]
I can see, bitch you ain't fooling me, no
I know just what is on your mind
Fronting like you want me, popping bottles spending money
Girl stop wasting my time

[Bridge: x2]
That's why I got my shades on low
Even though it's dark, cause I ain't fuckin with y'all
That's why I got my shades on low
Even though it's dark, cause I ain't fuckin with y'all
