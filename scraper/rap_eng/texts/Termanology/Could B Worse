[Intro: Termanology]
Termanology, Marcus D, SÂ­T dot. It could always be worse. At least we doin our thing

[Hook: Termanology]
When I'm goin through some shit I just light up an L
For my homey Easy Money that's up in a cell
In the ghetto man in the gutter it hurts
But it could always be worse so I thank God first
When I'm goin through some shit I just light up an L
All my niggas locked down that's up in a cell
In the ghetto man in the gutter it hurts
But it could always be worse so I thank God first

[Verse 1: Termanology]
I'm not a rapper I'm a regular man
I just happen to record records in a irregular span
So many homeys that's up in the pen
Time fly crazy how they look different when I see em again
Some brolickin and some gain weight
Some stress so they come back looking like they failed the test
You don't wanna sell your soul for your flesh
Some did but I know this one kid that was dumb as it gets
Somehow he never paid for his shit, so who really dumb?
The one givin it or takin the shit
I love the criminal life but it's difficult like
Stayin true to your church or your spiritual life
I ain't tryna be the Biblical type
But you live by the sword then you sure to get jigged by the knife
In your back that's that gon cop me a sack and relax
Before I spaz out on this track

[Hook: SunN.Y.]
When i'm goin through some shit I just light up an L
For my cousin DL doin time in a cell
In the ghetto man cause in the gutter it hurts
And it could only be worse so I thank God first
When i'm goin through some shit I just light up an L
For all my niggas doin time sittin stuck in a cell
In the ghetto man and in the gutter it hurts
But it could only be worse so I thank God first

[Verse 2: SunN.Y.]
He'd been live since 5 as a runner for the OGs
Easy rider papers with some ice cold O.E.s
Til one day he had to ask yo where my OZ
Told him slow down young blood before you OD
He walked off stompin his feet thinkin whoa is me
Man they played this lil boy like lil bo peep
So he just swore he saw to get the whole heat
Told his girl Shanice I'd rather die on my feet
Before i lose my manhood on my knees beggin please
So now by any means he just plot and schemes
Waiting for the top position used to try and whip cocaine
But he was sloppy never wanna wash the kitchen
So he switched positions changed it to extortion
Kidnappin just another way of ghetto entrapment
Now he figure he could get money as a stick up
Until he got hit up he gotta live up

[Hook: Termanology]
When I'm goin through some shit I just light up an L
For my homey Easy Money that's up in a cell
In the ghetto man in the gutter it hurts
But it could always be worse so I thank God first
When I'm goin through some shit I just light up an L
All my niggas locked down that's up in a cell
In the ghetto man in the gutter it hurts
But it could always be worse so I thank God first
