[Verse 1: Termanology]
I'm in the projects, elevator full of piss
Jansport on my back and it's full of fish
Crack open the bag, it smell like a corpse
And I don't need the burner, 'cause I'm a human torch
For me and Ap the goons will come and capture
Got more tools than that but for plastic rappers
Tryin' to pass the Mass they get smashed to plaster
With black masks and bats, razors and ratchets
Let's see
On the guest list ten deep
You can go and ask Red & Meth about S.T
How we knock rappers out
Send 'em to the dentist
Yeah talk is cheap but your face expensive, to fix
Shit is vital, rappers is suicidal
Tie 'em to a chair and slice they throat with the vinyl
I change my name to The Bible
Spit a whole album and labeled it self titled/Celph Titled
Term, I'm the god

[Scratched Hook]
"It's alright if you M.A.D
You'll never ever think you'll wanna
Take me out
You'll never ever ever ever ever
Take me out" - Greg Nice 'DWYCK"

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Skin tone whiter than a Hell's Angels biker
And a wing span wider than an X-Wing fighter
Rap writer, Chief Rocka, I'm taller than Chewbacca
Rocks in my tube socks, sinister as Chupacabra's clock
Mad money, mad hungry, Timbs muddy
Failed out of school 'cause I had a slutty study buddy
So gutter utter sorcery, the power absorbs me
Lights start blinking when the engineer is recording me
Watch the warlock at work call me The Ice King
Swing a battle axe, Ap is rap's last Viking
Me and Term burn bodies like a biological germ
A pirate throwin' bodies off of the stern
Spray your bitch with sperm when she's playin' my organ
Y'all don't ever get dome, they should call you the Headless Horseman
Never a pop star, I'll leave 40 cops scarred
And carry a box cutter from Oxford to Oxnard

[Scratched Hook]
"It's alright if you M.A.D
You'll never ever think you'll wanna
Take me out
You'll never ever ever ever ever
Take me out"

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
Fuck the captain, I shot the parrot off his shoulder
Blew the beak clean off so now the bird talk is over
Got a couple feathers in my face from lettin' the Beretta bake
Then I meditate and say what the Hell for Heaven's sake
The back of this turbine with torch, char, cook
Every bar, hook
We aim for you
Flame broil and filet
You're such a bitch that when you bleed you bleed Oil Of Olay
Want a riot I'll insight one
You work at Wal-Mart but scared to pull the trigger on a price gun
Fuck your network, you ain't close to my net worth
Disgust you when I show you my gross statements and what the jet's worth
I'll hold a stewardess hostage, I'm just plane/plain evil
My bestiality problem, I like to bang Eagles
Certified mental illness case
Whip you with a dusty pillow case till you can't feel your motherfuckin' face

[Scratched Hook]
"It's alright if you M.A.D
You'll never ever think you'll wanna
Take me out
You'll never ever ever ever ever
Take me out" - Greg Nice 'DWYCK"

"What made you forget that I was raw?
Competition's payin' the price" - LL Cool J 'Mama Said Knock You Out'

"Never ever, take me out"

Take two and pass, so the blunt will last
