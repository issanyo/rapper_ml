[Verse #1: Famoso]
At it again like I'm back the stem
This is the remix Peter Rosenberg we're  playing for them
Creme de la creme dropping jams like back FM
With a strong like hip hop Jay Ronin
DJ can't set one because the brothers are so bad
I bump the new '89 Tech N9ne Sucio Smash
The Dutchmaster is cuttin' he's working in the cold mine
We got some new schools in the cool put some Maltesers
Hard rhymer all timer make you shake like Alzheimer's
Chubb Rock and Sadat X their the greats of all-timers
Gotta catch their back spasms
Make them feel Phantasm
Spreading their germs busting like their Norad

[Verse #2: Termanology]
Yo, killing every microphone I'm liking every second alone
Next I'll be writing the typing of fighting the next emcee
Fighting me on these railroad tracks where they flare those gats
I know you can hear my whacks when I tear those cats
And so into oblivion aliens millions Milligan's in pieces
So whack rappers chopped up in my ceiling fan
I know you feel me fam my dead deep
Like my mixer Buckshot and Shabaam Sahdeeq
X marks the spot so we haul it out to Sadat
We kickin' it in with Famoso on the spot on the Dean Block
Mixed in with Chubb Rock on that primo shit
Silogy is going back on the Malatino shit

[Hook: M-Phazes X2]
We came so far it's like we take it back
Keep it movin' don't stop the motion
If my train went off the tracks
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up

[Verse #3: Shabaam Sahdeeq]
Under the underground sitting at the Earth's core
Crack in the ground when earthquakes when I spit the roar
Hard times it makes it all grinds
Hit the booth spit out hard rhymes
My mind is incredible my verses is never questionable
Knock out is never technical
My words spit out like a sneezer chop you up like a vegetable
My salad is seasonable is the spits I own
In the Springtime when I'm in College all the kids come home
When it's summertime It give you frostbite to keep you chillin'
Of all time my new style gives you a new fillin'
When I one time I spit hot and cold to warm your soul
Under the under world if I'm rock till I'm old

[Verse #4: Phantasm]
A lot of rappers are done and came and went
Never made a cent they content
By getting high playing bent
Just gettin' by when they have to pay the rent
I'll forever changing the cheddar and I can pay the vent
Set up shot I'm aim to hit
Ten shock waves through the underground made a dent
Self the ballers y'all remember the name
I got it hand perfect match mock walk the main train
Toll jobs spits flames to maintain
And played your position in y'all stay on your lane
You all in the game but you can play it the same
I've been hip-hop portables to stay in your brain

[Hook]

[Verse #5: Chubb Rock]
Brooklyn I'll Menage a trois yes that's crooked
Y'all don't want it I'll bobble your weight get pushed in
Warrior understated no need for verbals
Bookworm after learner and glasses but no Urkle
'64 old school legend did more
Then an average rider you deny it It doesn't give y'all
New bed holders and a M-troduction for the soldiers
Still loosened will reduce it but older it's been a minute
It came from a blizzard one for the sun that got high by nation for a visit
Get some wizards lyrically come to get wicked
Grab the star out of your hand to embrace to new assisted
I came with no movers I don't move with no losers
To prove to the losers that they move with no maneuvers
Every minute is a new flame the game
That they don't own go their own ways
But the youngest kids learn a little something to be own made

[Verse #6: Sadat X]
They should all know me or know of me
You still got to love me I'm a wild cowboy
My track triggers can speak to it's self and worldwide
World affiliation Yankees Stadium creation
The mood of the morning is the same name where Babe played
Nas is dead G'ed up
Watch me throw the heater
My name means a lot these days
Through the smoke and hays and I'll be out
Straight from the Kiosk
Reggae sounds good and the sun is still out
The car is still out still rolling
The X is Sadat to be what it be
Every time I get on stage I'll be a G-O-D
Don't worry about my age
Don't worry about my wage
Hit me on my page when you need that shit
