[Intro:]
Yea, as we proceed
Shout out my man Dynasty, the precedents all
Shout out all my street niggas
My man H Blanco
My man I Rack, free Gudda
Come on

[Chorus: x2]
This is how we livin the street life
This is how we livin, a good time
This is how we live in the hood
We keep it real yea, we keep it gangsta yea

[Verse 1:]
I'm from the ghetto door, white yellow, brown rice
Bodies hittin the floor, that's what that sound like
Man, she gotta tell me poppin out her shirt
In the club prego, ass fallin out her mini skirt

This is how we livin the street life
This is how we livin, a good time

We in that STR, double A T
DVD flyin off the rack, CD flyin off the rack
See me flyin off the mat, but I always come back
Where I was born, I was raised
In ghetto where I'll stay
These youngins act wild, pop off
Go to jail or join a gang
I'm from that 978
That's my hood, that's where I'll stay
In them projects with food stamps, well fans section 8
It's where you do good, make it out
Then everybody here
Home of them dope boys, my hood
Yo hood the same thing
Money, power, pussy yea, we doin the damn thing (damn thing)

[Hook 2: x2]
The block is on fire
The block is on fire
Police always lookin for me yea
(The) Police always lookin for me yea

[Verse 2:]
The block on fire cause we shootin niggas like The Wire
Come here get tied up, we don't play them games, we some riders
They know about us, they know about you
They know about me, they know how we do
Snitchin â€“ that be my death wish
So I keep my circle tight like my white bitch
See lately I've been getting funny thoughts, I ain't like this
I need a new jack, new jack, Wesley Snipes bitch
My clip full, my hammer cocked
Running ahead, don't get me started
My club full, I'm blowing loud
One to the head, let's get retarded

This is how we livin the street life
This is how we livin, a good time

That's why I keep glicker close, something right aways
And when I'm dead and gone, no tears, just play my tape

[Hook 2:]
The block is on fire
The block is on fire
Police always lookin for me yea
(The) Police always lookin for me yea

The block is on fire
The block is on fire
