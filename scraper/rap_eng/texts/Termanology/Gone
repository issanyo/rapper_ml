"Gone, gone, gone,a good man is gone"

[Verse One] [Reef The Lost Cauze]:
Ayo, I used to be a good man, but then the times changed
Too many haters throwin' dirt on my name
It used to bother me, gave a nigga migraines
I was so concerned with tryin' to do the right thing
But try it now, fuck around I might swing
The right quick as lightening and my hands where you life hang
Gave 'em an inch they wanted a mile
Huh, gave 'em a sip they wanted the Nile
Wanted to trip wanted to while
Wanted to make me, have to treat 'em like a motherless child
Can't stand you little niggas, wanna fuck up my smile
Hard rocks, hard knocks, get crushed into piles
Suckers and clowns, don't want 'em around
I need clarity so please spare me all your insincerity
I tried to give but these kids think it's a charity
It ain't fair to me so it's best that I bury me
And from the ashes a new man arose
Clutchin' a pistol, an all black suit with a rose
Dark smoke flows from his mouth to the roof of his nose
The man named Lost Cauze is dead as you know
I'm gone

[Hook]:
"Gone, gone, gone,a good man is gone"

[Verse Two] [King Magnetic]:
Forced my way to the front
Weight consignment the only way that I front
Occasionally thump, serenade with a pump
Seasoned catfish, by the way the Cajun it suck
Get sauteed and slumped from hallways and trunks
My song play for months, they all crazy once
They all say the stuff, I may be nuts
Album cuts
But when they drop like a baby's nuts
A lazy fuck, I'd rather you blow me
Talk crazy bucks, I'd rather you show me
Cause havin' you owe me is like havin' a homie
Half of the time is hassles and half of it's phoney
Now they actually know me, catchin' up slowly
Lady Luck has a passion with cold streaks, I ?
Hold heat in the tub without electric blankets
O.G. with my team like an athletic banquet
A lot of people stay thankful to God
I thank myself that I never got shanked in the yard
But I'll prolly get shot in my hometown
Watch how it go down
All the good is gone but we grown now

[Hook]:
"Gone, gone, gone,a good man is gone"

[Verse Three] [Termanology]:
Hold up
Let me tell you the real
For the cheddar I kill
Beretta's concealed to wet up your grill
Cause, I'm tired of playin' the nice guy
I stay in and slice pies before I go out and get my dough out
Throw out, money in the crowd
Makin' it rain, there's paper to gain
That's prolly why I'm takin' your chain
And fuck these rap cats
They all fake in the game
Funny ass daps on the search for the fame
Reversin' the Range, hop out and squirt at your brain
I got a nice clip, to insert in that thang
I'm a cool cat, I ain't a person that change
I'll throw dirt on your body throwin' dirt on my name
I hate when, cats take kindness for weakness
I speak this uniqueness, polices and precincts
Don't scare me, we can get it on
Blow the brains out a cop in his blue uniform
And I'm gone
