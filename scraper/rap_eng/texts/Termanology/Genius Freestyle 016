I hustle hard just to make sure so you ain't grow like me
Never walking through the rain and the snow like me
Proud to know, you'll never know poor like me
Never putting quarters in the pay phone like me
I wouldn't see my dad for weeks, stuck in the ghetto
Washing my clothes in the sink, these O's up in my bank
Used to be a fucking dream, I need buckets of cream
Walking through hell, I laced my mic with gasoline
Just like a race car, I need fuel in my tank
100 proof, 80 proof, whatever fluid you drink
Wanted to be a hustler, coming through in a mink
Then I seen what happens to you from a tool or a shank
These streets don't play fair they'll ruin your life
No more cell phone, now you getting news from a kite
Get yourself killed now, trying to wrestle the beast
I'm screaming Free Gutta even if he's never released
I'm screaming Free Wais, gotta keep eyes on those who despise
Your success, they'll set you up next
Sometimes your own flesh, and blood wanna see you fall
They don't wanna see you ball, if you ain't giving them none
Disloyal and then some
Like how you gon’ drink from the edge of my pen
I wrote those rhymes, but y'all just quote those lines
Plotting on your family like it’s the thing to do
You wasn't shooting in the gym
It's no ring for you
It's quiet
