My life
Done some things bad, done some things good
But as the world turned I learned life is Hell
Complex like walking through projects at night

My life
Does some things bad, does some things good
Living in the world no different from a cell
This how be in this everlasting game

[Verse 1 - Termanology]

Hey yo I know it ain’t right for me to get locked
Put my mama through hell cause I live in a cell
I live it really wholesale offer digital scales
My whole city need bail so a million pills
I had to move out to the fiends rush delivery
Jake ran in the crib, flushed the little p
Lost a little g, fuck it whatever
I ain’t really proud of it and I ain’t proud of my cheddar
I ain’t proud of all the drugs that I took when I tripped
I ain’t proud of all my burners when I’m loading the clip
I ain’t proud of when I punched my old girl in the lip
I ain’t really proud of shit, I can give you a list
I ain’t really proud of my fam, we fight too much
I ain’t really proud of my hand, it saw my knife too much
I ain’t really proud of much, I could tell you myself
The only difference is homie I won’t lie to myself

My life
Does some things bad, does some things good

My life
Does some things bad, does some things good
Living in the world no different from a cell
This how be in this everlasting game

[Verse 2 - ?]

You can bank whether it’s you and me or memories of arch enemies
We grew to be truthfully you the key
A chapter in my life ? the first part
A prelude to where my verse start both bonded by the cursed heart
Yeah we were smart, take a look at what our thirst caught
The street life, first it quenched me then it drenched me
Had me in a dream state till Lady Fate pinched me
Stopped and clenched me and the convinced me
Ever since we grew accustomed to the foul nature swindling crack
And trife life, ducking fife, leaving Timberland tracks
Of all the things I thought you’d do to get the Benjamin stacks
You went against the grain and fame to take my emblem back
Remembering back, I almost grabbed the Glock to rebuild
Sacrificed everything to being locked in a cell
I’m tired of looking towards the heavens while we walking through Hell
To my fam and all I am farewell, damn L

[Verse 3 - Termanology]

Island child, been in trouble with the law
Since a crime at nine, ‘98 in the jaws
In the claws of a cause when it falls when it’s cool
Then I froze but I rose when I sold ?
I keep thinking about flashbacks and memories
How I made all my cash back with felonies
I’m just a regular Diallo only with a bottle
Or like a newschool Slick Rick without the jewels
It’s so hard in this life when niggas carry tools
Playing by the rules when you can cheat like fuck school
And I’m stuck in the street and drug pools
Where the money is sweet, the money is large, the money is hard
A lot of niggas hustle and rob
But to make it out the hood it’s like what are the odds?
All this money generated but none of it’s ours
Happy that the only one who can judge me is God
