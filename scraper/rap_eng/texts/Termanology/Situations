[Intro:]
They understand
Sometimes I lose my mind
It's funny how money changes situations
Forgive me I'm drunk, I'll do this intro over the mom
Since ya'll wanna talk about money let's talk

[Verse 1:]
If I put a dollar in the bank for every time that I brought a dime
I would've started 9 bank accounts, Vavilon
Fills up my engine, vrrum vrrum
V8 and V12, feel the system boom
I invest in tunes, my music is money
Bout to start my own book â€“ Stackin Dough For Dummies
Yea buddy, I'm out of yo reach
Cause I be countin dollar signs when you countin sheep
I'm bout to get my degree and start to teach
The school of Tony Montana mixed with Big Meech
I got a cut, left my barber with a tip
So Biggie got a down payment on the whip
Let's get it poppin, show off ST
When I was on way ain't nobody cared for me
My daddy left, my mama was strong
Even though she was blonde she never sold her thong
My mama the bomb

[Chorus:]
They understand
Sometimes I lose my mind
It's funny how money changes situations
Sometimes I lose my mind

[Verse 2:]
Living the life for me mossing lights
Shows and flights travelling through the coldest nights
Everybody nowadays wanna hold the mike
Rolled them shows, impose with the frozen ice
It's funny how money changes situations
You get a couple dollars, you spend it all on a charm
He used to be yo man, now you just strangers
He better, you got some money now we wanna replace you
Now he wanna erase ya
'Cause you got diamonds, he got cubics with an eraser
All the jealousy and the anger
And to think it's all over a little paper
And make you lose yo mind
He mad cause you Diddy and he more like Sean
And ya'll was living a life of crime
And now you good, you figured that we woulda understood
Oh well

[Chorus:]
They understand
Sometimes I lose my mind
It's funny how money changes situations
Sometimes I lose my mind

[Verse 3:]
Sometimes I sit in my room, just me and a bottle
Hell I'm proud of myself cause I came from the bottom
And now I'm on planes every week
Making money overseas while my fans scream
And then I'm right back in the gutter
At the chimney truck, getting drunk with my brothers
I get some money, give it to my mother
She's so proud, no more run-ins with them undercovers
You know the moral of the story is
Never change, if you do, make sure you win
Take care of your kids, never be a hater
And save yo paper, you can't feed everybody
But it's good to stay close to the ones that was with you scraping yo burned toast at the crib
Pouring water in yo cereal
Now the googly standing round at yo video

[Chorus:]
They understand
Sometimes I lose my mind
It's funny how money changes situations
Sometimes I lose my mind
