[Hook: Termanology]
Hey yo it's my time
My time to shine
I'm coming for the crown, my enemies and the lime
I'ma lay 'em down
Cut the grass to snakes glow
I'm coming for the the cream, cash, the peso

[Verse 1: Termanology
I came in this game in 2K6
With two great bricks and laces, Lupe shit
Bumrushed a couple shows with the hungriest spics
Might empty out your pockets for money for kicks
I'm on some new shit, making beats and performing live
No more slinging 8-balls for some Jordan 5s
Family ties kept me on the local route
'Cause a dad's something my kids couldn't go without
I used to be wild and violent without a care
To stage diving on an island with DJ Premier
See how life turns around when you put it down
Reading the bible I realize I'm a leader now
My drug habit's getting worse when I feed it now
I started with a pint, I'm drinking a liter now
No more beefing now, I'm focused on these accounts
'Cause life's all about reminiscing, Aaliyah now

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Fame]
I came in the game young, no magnum
Bust off on a track called [?]
Opposite of Lil' Bow Wow drain
I rock knuckle rings and things
I never rocked a Mickey Mouse chain
I fly more high than why I can't land in my zone
And I put that on my family stone
Never planned to be the heir to my family throne
But that's the name that you inherit when your family gone
I love gear bikes with loud pipes
Nothing less than a thousand TCs
On [?] the CBs, we [?] DTs, burn the block up
Boy yell, let the clutch go, the front pop up
I'm from New York, Bloomberg can't stop us
I ain't your role model shorty don't watch us
I'm a general, ya'll better salute the kid
Time to show you who the future is motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Termanology]
I said ill quotes for federal notes
'Cause writing rap music is better than peddling coke
Better salute me when you see me, I'm one of the GOATs
See the Louis Lamborghini, the leather is gross
I done ran through the baddest ones
Hands full of kerosene
Now I'm all about peace, Louis Farrakhan
My cousin Lou still hit me with the ratchet
Ended up in Japan sipping Louis with static
I'm a B-O-S-S, my SS
Fits four in the back, two if you're fat
I got a cousin that's a criminal, uncle that's a preacher
Show him the same love when I see him every Easter
We all going to heaven, if not you know it
Me I walk through hell and shit'll start snowing
I'm a general, ya'll better salute the kid
Time to show you who the future is

[Hook]
