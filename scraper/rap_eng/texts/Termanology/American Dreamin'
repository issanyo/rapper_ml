[Hook]
Maybe I’m dreaming, they wonderin maybe I’m dreaming
Maybe I’m dreaming, maybe I’m dreaming
Maybe I’m dreaming, maybe I’m dreaming

[Verse 1]
Somebody pinch me and wake me up
For real, sometimes I feel like my life it’s dream
I couldn’t make this up
Everyday I’m waking up, time zone switching
Went from whipping in the kitchen to spittin' in Great Britain
I use to go to the bank, funds was inefficient
Now I sit back and thank god , I’m in this position
Won’t lie it’s been a mission
Plane, train, bus ride but I’m out to get it
That’s hustle ambition
I’m shitting on rappers and making money while in the process
Making dollars out of sense, I’m the definition
Now let me show you my vision, smashing movie audition
Hopping out of expedition with stacks in my True Religion
Celebrating every night like I just came home from prison
Sippin on Crys and just chilling dippin in different woman like New Edition
Did in the ’80 when they was hittin now I’m sitting here
Watching my dreams come to full…

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Somebody just pinch up and wake me up, for real
Cause I just woke up next to biggiest butt that I ever touched
S.T. tatted up, yeah she bad as fuck
Woke up from a dream I had like two hundred thousand bucks
That was in my duffle bag, millions in my account
Then I woke up from my dream, on my baby mama’s couch
She telling me “Term get out”, she don’t wanna work it out
I just wanna put it in, she just wanna run her mouth
Every time I get some cream it seem like it ain’t enough
Used to rock some dirty Tims now I ride Mercedes trucks
So I guess I made it huh, but I ain’t satisfied
I’m tryna give my kids a billion before their daddy die
They say that a dream is something you manifested
While I say “making that cream is something that I perfected” yup
When I wake up drunk in a puddle full of pillow drool
I think I’d lay silent and die before I spit out these jewels
