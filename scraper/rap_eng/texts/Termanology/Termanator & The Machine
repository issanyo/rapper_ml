[Verse 1: Conway]
Look, the flow so raw you could snort this
Of course it's Conway, it's Porsches in the driveway of my fortress
Know you can't afford this, so all my enemies turn into corpses
Hollow tips burning like torches
Broke his jaw with the impact of a horse kick
Had the youngin' chop his body up, he got nauseous
Flow gon' get me on the Forbes List
Until then I'm whippin' raw shit, whippin' 'til I get a sore wrist
Got my bitch in Dior shit and more shit
I sent on her trips, let her explore shit
She bring me raw bricks, this is God's gift
I will smack dog shit outta your favorite artist
I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer or the smartest
But, I promise, bar for bar, I'm one of the hardest
This for them niggas eatin' Jack, Mac and tuna fish
Niggas that really do this shit, they say was my influences
Niggas that's really shootin' shit, niggas that really move a brick
The way my buzz Disturin' the Peace, that shit is Ludacris
I got shot and they thought I couldn't do this shit
They hated on me but I'm from Buffalo, so I'm used to it
Don't confuse me with one of these rap niggas, I clap niggas
I get a little time, I'ma do the shit
I spit the truest shit, nigga
Fuck you thought, nigga?

[Verse 2: Termanology]
Word in the street, the boy's lookin' for you
You ordered a beef then they gon' cook it for you
I'm from where the base head still cook with foil
And they send the mercenaries out lookin' for you
My clothes smellin' like the hallway 'cause I went through hell up in the hallway
And all I seen was fiends off of Broadway
So, walkin' home, I took the long way
Even them chicks I treated the wrong way
They be sayin', "Yo, Term, I fuck wit' you the long way"
Contrary to what the law say, My candy concealed listenin' to that Conway
These rappers act real tough when the song play
But when it's beef, they turn into the entree
Watch 'em all get extorted soon as the Don say
Some put up a fight, but in the end, they all pay
Had some weeks it was all great
On the run and all I could do was parlay
Shell casings where your mom's stay
'Cause we just shot up the fuckin' block in broad day
A sip of 'Zay make 'em Cassius Clay
96 Niles influencin' the raps I say
Same hood I grew up in, that's where I stayed
Trappin' out the Hyundai, Sapphire, Bombay
'Ology
