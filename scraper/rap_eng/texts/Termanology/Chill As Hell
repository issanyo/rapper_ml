[Verse]:
I'm makin' money
It's money makin' Mitch
Makin' hits, go ahead run it back like Emmitt Smith
If they, short or they tall, I crush 'em in any position
I be crushin' them walls, I could work in demolition
You be ready to fall for any chick you be kissin'
On a mission, gotta learn how to diss 'em and dismiss 'em
Throw a ring on it
She better be in the kitchen
Doin' dishes, not all up in the club with all them bitches
I'm just sayin', just remember you buildin' a reputation
Gotta think before you move
Sun Tzu and meditation
Always blazin' glaucoma, discover my medication
Inspiration for these rappers, revealin' this revelation
On another level
Mental strength and motivation shows patience
Proceeds to the point they can't take it
And the levee break
Levitate above this democracy
Hypocrisy
Fake politicians, puppets for policy
I'm tryin' to see another black president get in with this economy
I don't see it happening again
I'll spit some gems
Try an see if the public will soak it in
I'll send my publishing check to my cousin up in the bing
Yeah it's me again
I continue to get it in
I'm the rapper with all them bodies you always gotta defend
Don't pretend I couldn't embody half of your top 10
I'll probably body anybody talkin' 'bout me again
I'm a sinner so when I go to Hell I cry a river
As long as I save my daughter, my momma, my pop and my sister
Then I'm chilly chill
Go and throw me inside a fire
I'll come out in a snow suit, frozen as Jeremiah
But my momma named me Danny Ill
I smoke them cannon L's
I'm in Canada with cuties sweeter than caramel
I'm on a carousel, emotional Ferris Wheel
While one day I wanna kill someone the next day I'll be chill as hell
I hold my liquor well
Known to give a chick a spell
Smokin' bigger L's so they say I'm chill as hell
Uh huh, that's right, they say I'm chill as hell
Cause I'm so cold pimpin' that I could chill in Hell
