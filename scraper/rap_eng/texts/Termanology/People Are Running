[Verse 1]
Night of the living dead
I got my pen and my pad with me
Writin' down every word that people said
I see some bitches head blown off her shoulders
By a soldier with a toaster in his holster like BANG!
Then this little kid came, with a AK
And a bullet proof vest that smothered his little chest
He just ran up on some chick
Blew her brains out, with his fangs out
Showin' like an animal and shit
Bodies fallin' from the sky
Better get ya umbrella
Go and put yo grandma in a bullet proof sweater
Yo gimme that cocaine
So I could sniff about eight ki's
That's eight lbs. more than the human brain
To the pearly gates mane
That's where I'm headed
But is heaven ready for a reverend that's killin' and sellin'
Or is hell the epidemic, I see when I close my lenses
Fuck pretendin', I'ma take you through my adventures like killers
So the people stay running

[Hook](x4)
People are running
Where are they going?

[Verse 2]
Fuck if you feel me
I give a fuck about a killer cause I kill any killer that wanna kill me
My mind's filthy, I ain't got it all upstairs
But I got a couple bottles of Jim Beam
My veins pump cognac until my bones crack
Gimme' that coke bag, I'm ready to toe tag
Couple people on my list, can't wait to see 'em
Cause when I'm done wit' 'em trust me you wouldn't wanna be 'em
It's like a death museum, come in my crib
You see bullets and burners and bodies, babies with bibs
Chronic bone crushers, Bohemian bricks
Brothas who rob banks with burners bigger than big
Crazy ladies with razors and blades shavin' they wig
Pigs slaughterin' pigs, killers slaughterin' kids
Homey pardon my wig, think I'm outta my brain
If you don't wanna be stayin' with Satan down in the flames
Then you better stay running

[Hook](4x)
People are running
Where are they going?
