[Intro: Wais P talking]
Jeah. Fuck is wrong with these hoes man? Goya boys bitch! Can't pull nothing past a pimp man. Trying to shoot them needles in-between hands and your motherfucking toes bitch. Hands all swollen, feet swollen bitch. Your feet done grow two sizes since I known ya. It been two weeks. Haha

"And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel" - Snoop Dogg 'Nuthin But A G Thang'

[Hook: Wais P] {x2}
She got heroine hands
Cocaine eyes
Dust in her pussy
Syringe in her thighs
Molly on her mouth
It's no lie
I'ma substance abuser, she ruin your life

[Verse One: Wais P]
She breath methadone when she sleeping
Percocet preaching
So much white on her lip, look like she bleaching
Type of bitch, she a star in the evening
Mixing bars with the methozine
But she's still a 10
I won't lie, I put the pussy on front street
Had a fight with four dealers, I was one deep
She brought me $27,000 and that was one week
See I got my own addictions and that's dumb cheese
She said she knew a nigga she used to be fucking
Got about, 60 in the safe
And we can touch him
He hustle out of Boston but, really he from Brooklyn
She get him to her house, we rob his dorm while she blow him
Now I'm thinking, "Here's a foul creature"
I'm a pimp, I don't do stick ups
I push the puss on model pin ups
Skeet on a bitch neck and tell her "Keep your chin up
It's gon' be alright."
You keep scheming, I'mma keep chilling in Coupes
Rocking karats/carrots like I'm swimming in soup
I don't rap, I'm just giving you truth
Living the proof
Suffering from alcohol abuse
This is how these hoes move

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Termanology]
Ayo she walk through the valley in the shadow of death
Nicotine on her breath, dry semen on her chest
She a bad bitch
Make your bitch look average
Don't cook or clean but damn she mean
On the mattress she do things that make you wanna backflip
Have you spending all your cash on fake lashes
Prophylactics, pussy pads and wine glasses
Double stack ecstasy packs and high fashion
The Tantric sex will have you trying to hand her checks
Funny how we used to call you a pimp
Now you turnt out
Burned out is how you turned out
Every time you went in your pockets she had her purse out
Direct deposit, hustling them hand outs
Remind me of them dirty bums with the cans out
Ha
You used to love her but she ran out
And soon as she figured out your cash ran out

[Hook]
