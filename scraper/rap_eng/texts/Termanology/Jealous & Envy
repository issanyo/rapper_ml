[Verse 1]
Uh huh ok
Uh huh ok
Tell me old slay G mother fucker
I’ve been down the road of bad luck and heartache
But heartache blows I seem men rize and how they fall
That shit broke dreams with morphine's and now they gone
By the self righteous speaks of where we going
The more  angles they pissed off cause now we on
It's like I went to Bagdad and I woke up poor
It's too many flaws and couches that I woke up on
I could never carry them all but I’m all choked up
But I think it’s from my distress and my road to poor
Live on shit I should have probably
Should have been coked up course
I’m going to spit I rose from the bottom of the pit
Beat the shit out of these beats and be the problem with this shit
They were saying I’m a beast when my dollars was a cent
Now I got myself ripped and holler at my grip
All you cok sucking bitches why don’t you swallow my dick
Get eternal on my name now they following me on clip
They put the roof on you was an underdog
Now you are a champion we should make a beat
But they know they fake cause they fear you
That's why they try to smear you when I’m walking
With the sand grill Every time they hear a rhyme
It punches with the beat and go ahead pull hands
Out of the crack of your ass

[Verse 2]
Jerman slaine is the future I use it back in the pass
Undeniable national we carry the weight on our backs
It don’t matter if you laughers or you crackers in black
Mother fuckers we ain't like the dumb ones too
So someone says something we keep it cool
Jealousy and envy is done once too
So tell me nothing then we keep our cool
Cause jealousy and envy will done one too
So slaney says something he keeps hiscool
You will see the envy in dumb ones too
So how me how it makes sense in keeping cool
I got punchline base frontline haste
When you slaying I go marlane mostly
To catch back in them beat has to make it
And I ain’t trying to make this a race
Because every homie got haters
Everybody that hate us over us is like
I make sure everybody got what they paid for
So tell me what you have to hate for
So if you don’t like us don’t front like you do just say so
What a life my ghetto life is nothing nice
My mother paid a price so that they don’t take my life
But I’m been hell a green I’m on the scene
And for the means focused more on Lucas dream
I’m on some luther shit please don’t make me shoot this shit
I’m a ludacris nigga to deliver I’m so ruthless
Easy with them simon these the ones finding seeking
Finding in the body bags they probably want to leave me as a korkus
I’ve been on the song and all that i was painted on this
So i wrote the hardest songs in some of the coldest moment
I can role up on your quadrant with a tube
Tell you say nothing tell me keep cool

[Verse 3]
We ain't like the dumb ones too
So someone says something we keep it cool
Jealousy and envy is done once too
So tell me nothing then we keep our cool
Cause jealousy and envy will done one too
So slaney says something he keeps hiscool
So slaney says something he keeps hiscool
