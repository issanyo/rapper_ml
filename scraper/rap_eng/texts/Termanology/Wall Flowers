[Intro]
We made so many moves
I believe we drank them all

[Hook: Your Old Droog &  Lord Sear]
I was stressed, moms kicked me out my rest
My bitch left me and I was depressed
But tell me how I was most consistent when my life was a mess
I guess that's when I perform best, yes
I had my back against the wall
Sing it, uh, huh, uh, huh, uh, huh, uh, huh
Had my back against the wall
One, two, check it out, yo

[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
There were times life felt so easy, I make it harder on myself
Sabotaged the pursuit of rap wealth, cause cash is dumb whack
I dug myself a hole, just to make a come back
Was writing daily to that Honey Drippers drum track
To the point that when I came out, they thought I was someone else
Ain't planned it like that, but it helps
Remembered recoding every week, just to get my chops up
And fools acting like I just popped out (what)
Before I ever made a project, I would go to projects out there getting busy
The fuck was suckas talking 'bout "who is he"
Son they been tryna tell you but you didn't listen, walking contradictions
I made it pop without y'all, I was on a mission
Now herbs come around acting like they made us
They in a state of envy like Vegas, Nevada
Fronting like they true with me, with no soul in the Prada
I been through real shit, man this shit is nada

[Hook: Your Old Droog (Lord Sear)  Together]
I was stressed, moms kicked me out my rest
My bitch left me and I was depressed
But tell me how I was most consistent when my life was a mess
I guess that's when I perform best, yes
I had my back against the wall
Sing it, uh, huh, uh, huh, uh, huh, uh, huh
(Nigga, pass the alcohol)
(I got my back, I got my back)

[Verse 2: Termanology]
Yo, on this road to getting money, I'm just sliding through
Got two whips, two kids, two baby mommas too
Every day a different city I be flying through
This stress gives you gray hairs, I just found a few
Found me a little bad bitch and she 'bout it too
Grinding hard, making sure this bank account is full
Had my back against the wall, fought my way through
Watched a couple cats profit off my wave too
Still running with the same crew, cause I stay true
Term and Statik established in 1982
This must be heaven, being a dad plus a legend
I got a seven figure dream, that's a lucky seven
I hit the dutch, exhale, then sip this cup
Tryna take away the pain so I'm liquored up
Listen up, every day you wake is a blessing
That's another twenty-four to grind for this cheddar

[Hook: Your Old Droog (Lord Sear) Together]
Back against the wall
Uh, huh, uh, huh, uh, huh, uh, huh
(Pass the alcohol)
My life was a mess, I guess that's when I perform best
(Back against the wall, yeah
Had the back against the wall, oh
Yeah, I got my back, I got my back against the wall)
