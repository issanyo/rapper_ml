[Hook: Cyrus DeShield]
If I fucks with you and you fucks with me
Baby why we wasting time?
Got my mind made up, I want you, baby
Stop frontin', get with me right
I fucks with you, and you fucks with me
Then why we wastin' time? What's it gonna be?
If you fucks with me, baby
If you fucks with me, baby
If you fucks with me, baby
If you fucks with me, baby, baby

[Verse 1: Lumidee]
Yo I done seen it all, heard it all, moved too fast, hit a wall
Gave it all, took a loss, questionin' could I be yours
And yeah I'm seein' how you move and everything you do
I might be judgin' you on some shit you ain't really do
'Cause when we're rockin', nothin' beats the feelin'
And I ain't got a problem ridin' shotgun if you're steerin'
So when you're sayin' that you want me, what that really mean?
'Cause when you're out there on the road, know it's another scene
You're feelin' lonely, cravin' that affection
And all these bitches jumpin' in your face for that attention
You could reject it, and I'm sure you're protected
There I go, my mind be goin' off into the left shit
So what we doin'? Really you're pursuin' this?
About to let my guard down, don't wanna ruin it
We got that real shit, somethin' you can feel shit
So what the deal is? I think we could build it

[Verse 2: Termanology]
I ain't sayin' it's love 'cause love is a strong word
But in order to love, you gotta have a bond first
Everybody makes mistakes, I'm no different
Promise never to judge, long as it's consistent
You go and see a couple cats hatin' like bitches
Tryna throw out the directs and sneak disses
They probably gonna tell you that I got a lot of women
It's one thing to hear it, it's another thing to listen
Judge me on my actions, my thoughts and my words
Your stomach never lies, you can start there first
Look me in my eyes, like deep into my soul
And travel throughout this realm as deep as you can go
We never have problems 'cause the sex is official
And when I'm out of town, I always text you, "I miss you"
I know you're kind of worried and respect is the issue
But trust me, you'll know it if I really fuck with you
