[Intro:]
It's like that mane
Realm Reality
Can't tell me nothing bout this cash, this hydro
Know what I mean?

[Verse 1:]
Cash & Hydro, money, weed and some fine hoes
Get it poppin like pyros, New York life in that grind mode
The fine flows, they don't want no beef like a gyro
Hieroglyphics be bringing me riches like I'm in Cairo
It's me and Term, don't discuss to the game
Disrupted like Bane, waiting for the football game to start bussin
Infamous and ST, bring em tall grounds
Push it back to law town, master as the all clowns
At the corner bodega, pitching on tall amounts
They play my music and use it while smoking strong loud
The kind of shit that make the homies short fuse proud
In the haze of clouds, your bitch aroused from one who throw the count
When you're the rap Tom Sawyer, they hatin on you
Reppin Brooklyn and California and still be rockin with Goya
The color of the Benz is albino
Cash & Hydro, the streets gon echo like a rhino

[Hook:]
Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro
Eyes low, Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro
Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro
Eyes low, Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro

[Verse 2:]
Got a money makin mentality, got to increase the salary
So I can have the financial support to blaze a pound of trees
Put it down for my niggas that's crossin boundaries
Bound to be in a cell, riskin they freedom for a thousand G's
Artisin in this bitch and Termanology
And the homie Realm, we give you a I'll reality
Got to love the cash and jewels, I'm all about the cheese
If you ain't about them both, don't even make a sound of me
This blood I be blazzin, nothing to play with sedated
So come and get faded until we faintin
When it comes to this green it's nothing short of amazing
Puffin stupid with college students who's uneducated
Smoking on that green, grown up in yo friends aquarium
He did a good deed, gave me weed, humanitarian
Got a short fuse, about to blow you niggas worry em
But I'm a get a bunch of dead presidents and bury em

[Hook:]
Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro
Eyes low, Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro
Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro
Eyes low, Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro

[Verse 3:]
Ayo, it's Term and Rectim, perverted speaks with them burners grippin
Start to clip em, my murderin spit onto the internet
But fuck the internet, my lyrics is intricate
You ain't even eatin a bit, raspberry vinegrette
My pockets fast in my vodka glass, in my rocker hash
And my hydroponic sour power, dust it I'm a devour
In a couple pulls, Ace & P stuffin full
How you think I got all these fuckin jewels, stuntin when I cruise
My click as is the wolves, gorillas and animals
Holding a 9 with 9 goons on channel 9 news
I ain't a gang member but I know some pyros
And they ain't tryna go to home base when they slide through
They tryna find food, you got all them fine jewels
They like how they shine too when they got they eyes glued
The cash and weed got me dashin speed and I make these plays
I hate losin money, I got jewish banker trades
Speakin of banks I should probably open one of my own
This shit I'm movin whole sale, got 100 a zone
My crib is sick, runnin trips with chicks and them ganja blown
You say at best you can't smoke yo blunt cause yo mama's home
I bring my pick when I go out cause I don't hunt alone
Camouflage mask and riffle and huntin clothes
Fuck a deer head, mural hangin on my wall
I got a live statue of the pope, John Paul

[Hook:]
Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro
Eyes low, Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro
Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro
Eyes low, Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro, Cash & Hydro
