[Verse 1:]
Ah, triple bean dream, call us the dream team
Show up, show up, this is goon rap
My whole platoon packed
Navy seal green beret, so move back
Mercenaries with bullets bigger than biggy's belly
That's really scary, I balls like 2 cherry, rest in peace Jerry
You prolly in into heavens, prolly chillin with eddie
I'm sippin on amaretas, mixed with heinekens
China white is piling up to a lot again
Will I shine again, like a diamond gem
And the, if I said it then I meant it
If it's drama, I'm a set it
Dress up like room service, and
Serve them in this melon, let me tell you bout this tellie
Treasures beyond measures, it's always Sunday in escalade
Talking where the money man, they did em ugly
Burn em slow, they dipped em in honey
Hung em from the bungalow on the block like some bullies
Like famelo, cut em down before they lose it
You talking bout how you do, where I'm from you gotta prove it

[Hook:]
We keep the block on fire, where I'm from
Better watch them wires, cause when the clock expires
Karma catch up, and you all done
We keep the block on fire, where I'm from
Better watch them wires, cause when the clock expires
Karma catch up, and you all done

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, money like trees, bitches like leaves
Falling on the floor, straight crawling for you boy
Take it to the top, paper on the watch
Rewind time, facement on the block
Now I'm in the straper counting paper by the nats
Redbone coty with the drop head body
Shake it for the paper all night we drinkin sirocky
Goons like the nazis, leave em in the lobby
Bleeding from the head, I'm a leader like Gadafi
Niggas wanna shoot me, why they haven't shot me?
John Starks miss, y'all niggas ain't even happen
Straight sex, court stressing like Dennis Rodman
My punchlines killin, your lyrics is just massaging
From uptown Harlem to downtown Brooklyn
You can catch me going shopping, tryina stay off the buckets
I'm hood! With the paper I am good

[Hook:]
We keep the block on fire, where I'm from
Better watch them wires, cause when the clock expires
Karma catch up, and you all done
We keep the block on fire, where I'm from
Better watch them wires, cause when the clock expires
Karma catch up, and you all done
