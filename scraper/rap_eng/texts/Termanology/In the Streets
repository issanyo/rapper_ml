[Chorus: Termanology]
We got it good, in the streets
I said them guns back
We got it good, in the streets
I said them guns back

[Verse 1: Termanology]
I'm from the streets, where your mama told you not to play
Guarantee somebody child got shot today
Fuck what them coppers say, still up on the block at eight
All of my niggas smoke more weed than Dr. Dre
Memories fade away, like the rain today
The more shit change, the more shit stay the same
The beef and Broccoli Tims, keep stompin your mans
The coffins full of flem, the blood's mixed in
Nigga, get with it, the bullits are infinat
They leave you imprinted, think you ready to die, cause Big said it
You get your shit dented, so don't mention it

[Chorus: Termanology]
We got it good, in the streets
I said them guns back
We got it good, in the streets
I said them guns back

[Verse 2: Lil Fame]
We got cops, rollers, shot callers
Narcs, Volvers, in the streets
Got crazy drama, baby mamas
Baby fathers, in the streets you got fed
Bombs, handguns, when somes
In the streets, you got bad cops
Crack spots, mad rocks
In the streets, you got wellfair
Hell care, that was never there
And that's the reason why we do drugs, shoot slugs

[Chorus: Termanology]
We got it good, in the streets
I said them guns back
We got it good, in the streets
I said them guns back
