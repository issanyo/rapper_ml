[Verse 1]
So you complain about population increase
To avoid the fact you sent for slaves
Was this the reason you administered aids
Well this is what happens when you let the beast out the gate

[Chorus: Termanology & Super Stah Snuk]
I put the bullets in my gun
Load em' up fit the clip into the top
The 22 or the shotgun
Pop it, we gon' spit it 'til they drop
Either way when I pop one
Either way when I pop it you gon' fall
Mass murder's the outcome
No strays in my gun I kill em' all

[Verse 2]
I bet you've never suffered once in your life
Motherfuck the detonator, plan maker, life taker
I'll recruit your daughter strap hand grenades on her
Hand her the AK ask her to die for honor

[Chorus: Termanology & Super Stah Snuk]
I put the bullets in my gun
Load em' up fit the clip into the top
The 22 or the shotgun
Pop it, we gon' spit it 'til they drop
Either way when I pop one
Either way when I pop it you gon' fall
Mass murder's the outcome
No strays in my gun I kill em' all

[Verse 3]
(Officer down, officer down)
Whatever happened to assassination, evacuation and Hiroshima?
The box cutter, it cuts through your lover like butter
1,000 crying mothers lie awake under the covers

[Verse 4: Termanology]
Antennas and scanners
Hammers damage your grandmas and nanas
Bandanas over the handles
Cannons blammin' bananas
I'm never speakin' with manners
I'd rather make people vanish
And bury creeps in the granite
My legacy is satanic
I'd pop a cocky copper copy
Walkie talkie honky Nazi
Drunk off saki, dump and watch me
The kamikaze
The desert eagle is lethal
It rips through people, it's evil
And it is equal to sequels of Nagasaki

[Outro]
It's murder
