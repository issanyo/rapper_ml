[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Young Krizzle that nigga they never rule out
Goin' forward, hit like Thor, what movin' you 'bout?
Lot of niggas claimin' MC's won't stand the test of time
Thank God I was blessed to rhyme the way that would reflect the shine
Lights on the southern country folk
Know they hatin' when I'm bassin', knockin' pots up off their porch
Window tinted, got me hidden, creepin', crawlin' like a float
Or parade, grippin' grain and chariots on them spokes
Spartacus couldn't spar with us, true gladiators
I had concubines way before I had paper
Tryna live in high rises, Mount Olympus krill
This ain't even my spot, it's just some simple shit
Got a couple Medusas that keep me rock hard
These niggas optical illusions, they are not stars
If it ain't that GQ then it's not ours
Fuck that bullshit, bitch, I'm 'bout war
Hope you're 'bout yours

[Hook: Scratches]
I'm one man against the world
Remember this forever
The king of my kingdom
Bring it to 'em raw
Ready for war
That's how you bring it

[Verse 2: Termanology]
Ayo I spit sick, it's Term the ill spick
Here to rip shit down with Villa and Big K.R.I.T
It's the gambino, callin' in shots like Rick Pitino
In the Benzito, hustle for ends, and Bens, c-notes
I'm in the villa with Villa, bumpin' that Dilla
Pop a pill or crack a fill and just listen to how I kill it
Yo your boy's chill, but my chain is chilly, chilla Charles Manson
Choppin' bodies and throw 'em in the river
I be head huntin', puttin' hundreds on your head
Hollow heads have you singin' Hail Marys in your bed
See the bloodshed? Ain't a blood but I love red
I be blackin' out, wakin' up runnin' away from feds
Went from Beantown, Chi Town to Mississippi
Got killers with me flippin' them 50 cals, gettin' busy
Ain't a thing pretty, I'm prolly goin' to Hell too
And when I do I'll be chillin' with Pun and L too
But I'ma let my man Pun tell you

[Hook: Scratches]

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Game of thrones, king of the north, that's how my name is known
Play bold, off with your head soon as the blade is shown
No chaperon, you alone in the battle zone
Dome blower, lightin' up the room like bad cologne
I spit piff, still kill you with the stress line
See a sigh on the set whenever Deck rhymes
I be closin' on bread, just like a bread tie
Reppin' SI, do or die, NY
Ridiculous game, my slang tastin' big and gross
Thirty chicks on their period ain't got a sicker flow
Three chicks alone, I spend about what you get a show
You still runnin' behind your man like a pick and roll
Call me the general, there's blood on my stripes
Mud on my Nikes, the struggle made me double the price
I'm nothin' nice, I shake 'em like a couple of dice
Wanna ride with a nigga, better buckle up tight

[Outro]
There's a code! Your clan tried to kill me, now I'll kill all of you! I warned you! You have no chance!
