Thinking back to 88, the memories will live on
The box of cereal and wrestling every saturday morn'
I remember one day I was mowing grandpa's lawn
I had the radio outside; "You Got's To Chill" came on
I used to run home from school for Rap City at three
But now they only give the shorties ass and titties to see
My homegirl said: "These rappers now-a-days is prettier than me"
Whatever happened to days of Tribe and BDP
We used to get up and run to the basketball court
But now with everybody high NBA Live
Is the closest thing we gettin' to sports
These girls are 14 years old in they coochie cutter shorts
It's innosence is lost
But some things are still the same though, keepin' a nigga raw
Chris is still rippin' Rick Flair still gotta the figured form
Let's take it back to the essence
So that the next generation could be happy with the presence

[J]Ain't like it used to be - (Ain't like it used to be)
When we were kids
[T]The 80's is crazy for the babies
And now-a-days these little shorties amaze me
[J]Ain't like it used to be - (Ain't like it used to be)
When we were kids

[Termanology]

Way back, when Anni used to sit with us and talk
And we was poor, so we used to take the bus or walk
My mom schooled me, not to ever touch the rock
Touch the white, or cook cocaine in a pot
Listening to Pac, me and my brothers would box
And write graffiti on the ground with the coloring chalk
My brother was taught, never hang with them gangs
Cuz when them things bang, you can lay in a box
Take care what you rock, just for sayin' your not
From another side of town, and the colors you rock
Could your crib shot up, like your mother is not
Sound a sleep with hoax like the government got
I suddenly thought; look how much the world changed
And life in general, dark nights and cold days
Sittin' in hallway's listening to old J's
Thinking of the old days, like P i reminice
