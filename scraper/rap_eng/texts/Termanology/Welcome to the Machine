[Sample]

Pink Floyd - Welcome To The Machine

"You've been in the pipeline
Filling in time
Provided with toys and scouting for boys
You brought a guitar to punish your ma
You didn't like school
And you know you're nobody's fool"

[Chorus]

"Welcome to the machine" - 2X

[Termanology]

Ayo, what is a hit record, how is it defined
Is it designed from jump to be a big record
Or is there a big check to be collected
As directed, add the record, to rotation
Now it's playing, somebody paying, nobody saying
Somebody manager, somebody agent, somebody label
On the payrole, from the cradle
All I ever wanted to do was rap
But that don't bring pesos
Unless you make dough, doing payshows
And even that do not come by the pays slow
Unless you a slave on, somebody label
Major radio, major video
50 city tour, hope the tickets sold
How typical, yes cynical
They gotta you hush, just keep in touch
With your publicist, she gonna tell you what yo spit
Or your A & R, he gonna help you lay your bars
Politicly correct, or no check
Welcome

[Chorus] - 2X

"Hi, I am your CEO, I am your friend"

[Ea$y Money]

It's funny how these rappers be thinking they're so hot
But they have no guap, they're my little robots
I am mister machine, you and I will make a team
And we will get ourselfs, I mean myself alot of cream
I'll get of anything, you'll be making me dumb funds
In other words i'll be porking you in your bum bum
You wanna get up out that ghetto that you come from
Well make a decision, and don't make it a dumb one
Think big, compromise your integrity
And I promise one day you'll become a celebrity
Trust me, I will never cross you like the letter "T"
Now do everything I tell you, and just let it be
I'll get you features and production from the bigshots
And you will forever in debt if your shit flops
Commercialized, don't try and save hip-hop
Matter fact, why don't you try something like Big Pop
Or Jay-Z, all the records fly up off the shelf
Just make sure that you sound like anybody, but yourself
It's just the nature of the buisness, don't be mad at it
Now a make hit before I drop you like a bad habbit

[Chorus] - 3X
