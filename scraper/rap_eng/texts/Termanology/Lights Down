[Hook:]
I’ma turn the bass up, you can turn the lights down
If you ain’t had enough, you gonna get it right now
Get it right now, get it right now
If you ain’t had enough, you gonna get it right now
Get it (get it) like now, get it like now
Turn the (turn the) the bass up, you can turn the lights down
If you ain’t had enough, you gonna get it right now
If you ain’t had enough, you gonna get it right now

[Verse 1:]
Damn right: I’m from a city you ain’t never heard about
Wasn’t making noise then, but I’m making noise now
Making dope shit, what I’m all about
I’m Wu Tang in '93, fans like my shit loud
And I made my mama proud, turn the TV on, wow
She just clicking through the channels while she’s sitting on the couch
There I is, it’s time to celebrate now
You can tell the bartender we gonna need another round (it’s going down)
In and out of labels all the time
Had to change up my ideas, had to switch up my designs
Went from dreams of being major to the independent grind
When you come to think about it man I’m doing just fine
Cause I’m that YouTube and I’m on that iPod
And that girl up in the front row screaming 'my God!'
Big up to my fans and all of my squad
You can call me what you want, just call me an icon

[Verse 2:]
Took a ride to NY, had a lot of time to think
5 people got stabbed, 2 murdered this week
In my hood, in my city, only 6 miles wide
Hurricane full of tears, filling buckets outside
Mama going in the shop, as she watch her son die
Police say another unsolved homicide
Damn kid, what a shame, when I think about the youth
Used to think about a play, now I think about the booth
Just had another daughter, so now that makes two
Gotta teach them to be smart, do it thug’s point of view
Gotta teach them 'bout respect, gotta teach them 'bout the rules
I ain’t talking on their neck but I gotta give them jewels
Looking back on my life, though I'm less than halfway
I could say I was a leader, had a lot of shit to say
On the nights my inner demons try to make the plan stray
I just hold another jay and let the thoughts fade away
