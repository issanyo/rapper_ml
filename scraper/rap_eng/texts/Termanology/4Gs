[Verse 1: Ea$y Money]
We go hard when we play the sport
Supreme/sue Preme like we took the DJ to court
You not built for rap, when will you discover?
My dawgs break weed up on your disc cover
Mean rhymes on deck like the dealer's hand
But we still take work out the dealer's hand
This pack a 1000 short, oh you stealing grams?
Some loss happened to grandma, kill a gram/kilogram
Flow butter, your man is on the road
Strapped like Lamar, mean handle on the phone
Don't be flossin' when my clan on patrol
They gon' catch a vic/Vick, animal control
Flow with no pen still eat a nigga writin'
Rhymes sick, these bars need a liquor license
Take shots for the squad you can get the same
Team I'm down for/four like a two possession game

[Verse 2: Scram Jones]
Ayo I used to hold a Visa with no stash
Now I keep my doe up in the freezer, cause all I want is cold cash
Get caught up in agree get your throat slash
But who am I to even teach when I got no class?
From the horses mouth that's why I can't act stable
Just a dog that's known to go and rock a cat's cradle
I'm in Vegas trippin', drinkin' on black label
In the casino slippin', shittin' on a crap table
Oh no habits, Bozo status, bang a Ralph Lauren's daughter on a Polo mattress
I told her, "swallow your pride and suck it up."
And shoot a load to the ceiling, bitch I'm cummin' up
Ain't shit change, beats is steady knockin'
So when chicks give me brain I make sure the heads is bobbin'
Pound the speaker, pounds of reefer
You keep it 100, I keep it 3000, Jeter

[Verse 3: Termanology]
Stat' crazy with the beats, T crazy with the flows
Just like Watch The Throne if Jay and them was broke
We from from the bottom
Yep yep the bottom
Down here where the soil might be
I'm Diallo
Uh
No gun
But they open fire
Uh
So fun
Ralph Lo attire
? is drunk, I'm burnin' tires
Flier than the fliest fly, floatin' through fire
I'm in the Chevy Caprice, with four G's
In the south where I got gone for four Gs/4Gs
Not the phone, I mean four Gs
The only other PR cat or Ortiz
Not Dave or Tito
But I'm the champ
Little water and some trees, I'm the camp
I put my hands in the atmosphere
Showoff laughs some of the best rappers here

[Verse 4: Wais P]
Still nicer than Cam Newton, my man's shootin'
What up rookie, got a whole season you need provin'
What's the reason, spit raps like a nigga teethin'
My right hand asthmatic, leave a nigga weezin'
50 karats on my chest got my nipples freezin'
