Hook:
Ayyo I look like money, I walk like money, I talk like money
I smell like money, I act like money, I rap like money, I put my money in the back then go!

Verse One:
Ayyo this is for my goons that be breaking and entering
Roll up in the Berg from the project tenements
Leave your crib with a Santa bag full of presidents
Eyes dialated but leave no evidence
Leave yo residents, tied the fuck up like a circus elephant, purchase medicine
With the money from your mom purse and her television, E's, Oxys, Coke, Amphetamine
Sniffing and shredding it, redirect of a gentleman, hotter then the kettle
This metals full of adrenaline
Far from a gentle man, cuz I enter scams, with last weeks blood on my hands
You cats sweet like Candy Yams! I'm the Candy Man! Say my name five times and Blam!
You see your enemy and you ran, I see my enemy and put up my hands or just give him a glance
Like, you ain't hurting nothing the curtains shut on your hurse and then you
Dead as a horse that'll dead as cavorcki and I, Triz in a orgy then throw her back in the audience
Celtics jersey I bought is just fresh and looking accordingly give a fuck what you thought of me
I'm a rhyming minority, cuz i'm ill and all these new cats is boring me
Celebrating cuz Bun got the source cover, love to see my niggas make it, pass they imagination
Free Easy Money with street money I made it, never went to school I got a college education
But I move Jason, call me the doctor, have made patients, weed like a Rasta
Chicken with the pasta, that's what he ate, I can tell when they shot him, homie spit up his plate
Isn't it great, we living in a biblical state, eye for an eye, so I might rip up your face
I'm a problem, I should of got signed by Suge, but I didn't, so i'm still stuck in the hood
I walk around like my shit don't stink, with my big ol' Linc, give a fuck what you weirdos think
I tell them i'ma be the best an nobody is stopping that, some say i'm a cocky cat
But I ain't a copy cat, got a couple people robbed, but they ain't rob me back!
Sucks for them, feels good for me though!
I'm a murder mas with white trash that like cash so they sell white fast till they whole life pass
Got a Mami with a big old ass, and another one that's flat just for rubbing my back
I'm in the trap like a mouse, call it the crack house, OG's mash out,smoke weed pass out

Chorus:
I look like money, I walk like money, I talk like money
I smell like money, I act like money, I rap like money, I put my money in the back then go!

Verse Two:
Ayyo this if for my goons that be 4,5,6ing it
Percecet, purple haze, cocaine mixing it
Propane sipping it, but my brains infinite, like Slim Ferg shit, trust me I hurt shit
Comparing me to regularities, hilarity it's charity the way I get you high when you hearing me
Yall rappers be scaring me, must be cuz you crazy, rocking them tight pants, like my old lady
Free gutta lee's, gutta streets got me bugging I can move a half an onion ever hour if its fronted
Oh yes! Homie I smell like money, cuz when I was a kid I used to dress bummy
And that wasn't funny, and it still ain't, enemy's wanna hate but i'm laughing to the bank
I burn shit down like more the mills baby, suck on my balls while you palm the dillz

Chorus x2:
I look like money, I walk like money, I talk like money
I smell like money, I act like money, I rap like money, I put my money in the back then go!

I look like money, I walk like money, I talk like money
I smell like money, I act like money, I rap like money, I put my money in the back then go!
