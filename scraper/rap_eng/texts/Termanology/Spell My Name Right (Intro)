[Intro: DJ Premier]
You showing off, I'm showing off. This is DJ Premier and Showoff records is about to blast, you heard? DJ Statik Selektah 'bout to put this shit on the way it's supposed to be put on and the name of this album: Spell My Name Right. You heard what the fuck we just said. This is DJ Premier and it's on and popping and it's all real

[Hook: Samples]
Spell My Name Right
It's the boss of all bosses, well respected, reputation flawless
Statik Selektah, been a long time coming, it's showoff
Spell his name right
There's no competition, it's just me
Spell my name right
From Boston to Brooklyn man
Hip-Hop is dead, some say it's wack
We need to bring it back

[Verse 1: Termanology]
Yo it's time, one of the illest DJ's of the scene
Co-signed by the best like Tony Touch and Preem
He brought you over to Queens with your man Q-Tip
Cormega, Cons and [?]
And took it back to the bean, [?] to be exact, where your boy Term' and Reks were at
Representing for them B.K. cats, you got Joell Ortiz, Uncle Murda and Talib Kweli
Shout out the boy Red Caf√© and AZ
And my man Lil' Fame repping M.O.P
Y.O. stand up for Lox and Styles P
BX put it down for Chris and A.G
Philly cats, guns up for Cassidy and Free
LA blaze up for Al and EV
Royce and SV put it down on the mic
With my man Statik Selektah, spell his name right
