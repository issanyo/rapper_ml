[Verse One: Sean Price]
Ayo Dexter Manley
Pull skets wet your family
Overstand the underhanded ways of my camp B
Sean Price the general so generally speakin'
I'll put ten in your body your friends be leakin'
Never chill on the weekend, the sun don't chill
Gat will spray on a Saturday cause I'm from the 'Ville
Got no time for petty lines
Rappin' your stupid shit
You can get a fist in your face for fuckin' with the pugilist
Sean ain't new to this
Rappin' awhile now
Happy drug dealer, sell crack with a smile now
Karate chop crillz, Johnny Knoxville
Get high from my own supply, that's not real
Your arms too short to box with the god
Ya weed wack, don't smoke pot with the god
Listen
Sean Price is the prophet of profit
The best nation is donation, Elijah Mohammad
P!

[Verse Two: Muneshine]
Your man Mune seen a lot of charades
That's why I body rap types with a mic, fuck a Prada parade
No Robin/robbin' I get the Batman/bat man
I swing fast and crack, look dawg
I lay these ? up in the Satscan
I throw tape in the task and a pro with the tools
? vocal after the plaques man
I want cash man, save your lines
Your talk is cheap so I pay you no mind
Yo fuck that
Your man Mune is no longer naive
I no longer believe in the big dreams you'll no longer achieve
(say word)
I gets focused with ease, I say whatever I please
And watch the labels fork over the cheese
It's that simple
I travel with a vintage flow
But I'm not the same producer/rapper that you think you know
Legendary when I carry the mic
It's type scary, don't compare me to the rest of these hype kids
I'm askin'
What now?

[Verse Three: Termanology]
Ayo, Puerto Rican Term but this ain't no Reggaeton
Yo I'm, gettin' in on like Rakim in his zone
And every track I do is gettin' complemented on
If you bluer than Snoop or redder than Jim Jones
I'm back up in the wire, I'm here to set it in stone
I ain't tryin' to get the king, I'm just tryin' to get on
Kinda funny how my flow just switch on every song
For that Cash, Money, Hoes like Ja, X and Hov
I know I'm gonna go triple plat before the day I die
Plus I'm gonna slay every track and I be sayin' "Hi"
Man if you two niggas scrap then nigga stay inside
Rappers, they be sayin' they strapped, but they be sayin' lies
I be livin' out in the X, but I be out in Queens
B.K., S.I., Manhattan and I done seen
Many Bloods and Crips, Disciples and Latin Kings
And I be doin' this shit for y'all so all my niggas scream
What!?
