Termanology, Kinetics, One Love
Yeah, ay, ay, up all night
Too much hustle to close my eyes
All these dreams upon my mind
So I stay scheming, yeah
I’m a dreamer, Baby I’m a dreamer
Home with a freak, but she don't sleep neither
(sleep neither)
Yeah, ay we up all night, but I’m still dreaming

[Verse 1: Termanology]
I’m taking over, let me make it perfectly clear
This is for my uncle Nelson, cause he got murdered last year
I know you ride around a beemer, blowing purple up there
Hoping to make you proud of me when you see my career
I’m going off, plenty of concerts in different continents
Models from different countries showering me with compliments
Euros in my accounts just counting them like they counterfeit
Down to spit on your record and shred up your speaker monitors
Honestly it was all a dream, like Chris Wallace said
Took my dream and I followed that, obviously I body that
Been on every station, regardless of the politics
College kids fill up my venues now and ask me to sign their kicks
The time keeps ticking, so the grind keeps lifting up higher and higher
I’m climbing trying to acquire millions
And this is for my fans that have been waiting so long
Be patient, we almost on, it’s here, it’s your song, let’s go!

Yeah, ay, ay, up all night
Too much hustle to close my eyes
All these dreams upon my mind
So I stay scheming, yeah
I’m a dreamer, Baby I’m a dreamer
Home with a freak, but she don't sleep neither
(sleep neither)
Yeah, ay we up all night, but I’m still dreaming
We up all night, but I’m still dreaming
We up all night, but I’m still dreaming
We up all night, but I’m still dreaming

[Verse 2: Kinetics]
Ash to ash, cause everything in life’s a cycle
They praying on my downfall as they recite the bible
But snakes slither in the grass, acting like disciples
So I live my life to the sight of a sniper’s riffle
Ah I could go at Mike for the title, the ring’s been crowded
But even when I’ve been doubted, I’ve been bout it
Damn right I been sour
Compared to me, everyone in this building is too plane, twin towers
Hustle deep, I sleep like an insomniac
I ain’t trying to be 29 and driving a Pontiac
A storm’s forming, this is the forewarning
I’m breaking the door storming roaring like George Foreman
I’ll leave you with lacerations, a gash and a bad abrasion
You'll be lacin' every bag that you're blazin' with Bacitracin
I’m basically the ’80s President’s administration
I’m here to give the streets crack, call it Ronald Reagen

Yeah, ay, ay, up all night
Too much hustle to close my eyes
All these dreams uṗon my mind
So I stay scheming, yeah
I’m a dreamer, Baby I’m a dreamer
Home with a freak, but she don't sleep neither
(sleep neither)
Yeah, ay we up all night, but I’m still dreaming
We up all night, but I’m still dreaming
We up all night, but I’m still dreaming
We up all night, but I’m still dreaming
