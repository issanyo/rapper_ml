[Verse 1: Termanology]
The psycho demon evangelist, the new cannabis
Ignoramuses ramming this hammer in your bandages
Swallow the Earth as a whole, leave you planetless
Bandages covering bandages whenever Danny spits
So understanding this frantic panic analysisis
Alcoholic anonymous standing where the brandy is
Stranding not understanding landing in front of Brandy's whip
I'm Ray J fucking Brandy in her hairy puss
How dare you shush? Shut your fucking mouth
I'm the one they talking 'bout, dragging bodies out the house
I'm Freddy slash Jason, ready slash patient
But with a mask waiting for satan to come and take 'em
Drive across the zakim diamond crosses, take 'em
Hoping God forsake 'em waiting at the Pearly Gates
Not even your girlie safe, I'll furtilize a tank
I'll murder rhymes one line, money in the bank
Don't try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
I'll slap the shit out of a rapper like if I'm his momma
I'm about a dollar, fresh five Dalai Lime 'em
Dressing Calvin liner, all blue fabrigama
Paralyze your parents, put 'em in pain and in pajamas
Like Jeffrey Dahmer, eating through your flesh and armor
Whip so high look like a convertible sauna
I'll murder ya honor, watch it on the Panasonic
The crowd proud to ride us flocking like Colby O'Donis
I'm holy and honest controlling the product
Product of my environment, coke Reaganomics
We selling them (?) fresh of the models
Like we hit the lotto, all black Eldorado
Around the clock serving fiends, all night McDonalds
Behind the mic I'm a sight like Mike in Chicago
I ain't the one to follow son, I ain't your role model

[Verse 2: Lil Fame]
I'm cold as a bottle with that Olde English 800
I'll finish the bottle and tell your momma to refund it
She cool bitch though, I'll pay her to wash the whip though
She take long cause she got a bad hip though
Fuck it, she still the shit though
I gave it to you raw from the get go
Okay, lets not forget, they say I got tourettes
I'll drive through Town Square banging 'Fuck The Police'
Blowing weed smoke out the window, of a Pinto
You know I'm live as shit
Be careful when you banging my music bcause it may cause side effects
Make a nigga black out, do stick ups and robberies
Fuck around and break into your own crib
Steal your own shit
Cause everytime I put out the records I make
Motherfuckers go bananas like this was Planets of the Apes
I'm a W A R two times
I O R, beat you with a crowbar
Send you to the OR
I'm as live as this shit gon' get, it ain't nobody after
So finally we can get to the witness final chapter
I don't spit about hot whips, exotic bitches and fashion
Just the realest for me and my niggas smashing
And we got big guns and bullets in hands
You surviving is a slim chance
I put two in your chest like implants
You fucking with the baby boy of Jim Brown
Look how I get down
Idiotically it's fizzyology
