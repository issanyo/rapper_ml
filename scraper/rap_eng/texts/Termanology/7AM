[Termanology]:
I be makin' problems you don't wanna cope with
From '06 to 0-10 I wrote hits
M.A. general, you salute him
Don't wanna better your life cause you got no bread
My fellas with just unload bricks
You funnier than a coke head on a moped
And I roll with them hoes that be provokin'
Shawty give big head, George Lopez
Pause
I'm gettin' money like Pro Keds
You dash and you gettin' snatched in a Focus
I roll spliffs that B.I.G. like Chris' flow is
This old shit, mixed with new shit
We got new hits, Rubix Cube new bitch
In the whip, new fur like Frank Lucas
Got muy chips, Louie kicks, toolie's spit
And my crew can spit like we all stupid rich
