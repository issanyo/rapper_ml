[Intro:]
Money
Tryna get paid
We just out here getting money (echoes)
Gettin money (echoes)
Yo know me
Passport T

[Verse 1:]
Spin across the sea where the seafood is seasonal
Be reasonable the reason we keep teasing you
Cause we eatin’ and you feenin on what we would do
When we be getting money off rap while you dreaming to
I woke up from a dream had a hundred gs or two
Didn’t count it, I wouldn’t know, just bought a key or two
Then I hit up everyone that i’ve been meaning to
Warned them that they bout to see me on the big screen and soon
My man has a mansion don’t nobody know his name
Everybody know my name but I ain’t got a mansion
And for ma man’s I still be collecting cans
With dirt all over your sneakers and garbage juice on your pants
Get yours man

[Chorus:]
We just tryna get money
Tryna get paid
We just out  here gettin money
And tryna get paid
We just out here gettin money
And tryna get paid
Tryna tryna get paid
Tryna tryna get paid
We just out  here gettin money
Tryna get paid
We just out  here gettin money
Tryna get paid
We just out  here gettin money
Tryna get paid
Tryna tryna get paid[x2]

[Verse 2:]
You know you could never have enough
It’s gone before you get it
On my way to collect and I’ve already had spent it
Keep guns and work to flip in the apartment
Get into the bread like them pigeons by the park bench
Tryna live my life right, sipping Mai’Tais
Pushing a fly ride, keeping these honeys eyes wide
But I’m hustling till i die
Baby moms got her hands out but she not giving me high 5s
Any chance your man’s taking
Cheffin without no damn apron
Moving trees no landscaping
And you tryna see that box of feds reserved no?
I’m tryna get my hands on these fed reserved notes
Getting money

[Chorus:]
Tryna get paid
We just out here gettin money
Tryna get paid
We just out here gettin money
Tryna get paid
Tryna tryna get paid
Tryna tryna get paid
We just out here gettin money
Tryna get paid
We just out here gettin money
Tryna get paid
We just out here gettin money
Tryna get paid
Tryna get paid
Tryna tryna get paid[x4]

[Verse 3: The Astronomical Kid]
Look
We told the streets peace
Cause our abilities pay a bill or two
Got minimal respect, now we rocking minerals
Less presence on the block, homies tryna find us
Might have to dial us, we making dollars
Dames know the name
We ain’t gotta have fame 'cause we in the game
Don't flash
Lames tryna picture bullets in the frame
Mama concern 'til you return what urns
And you got enough to get some new furniture
Bomboclat, you say rap pays, your killin' it
Your a murderer but you still innocent in a sense
Just some lil souls tryna find an escape
And at the same time make some papers

[Chorus:]
Tryna get paid
We just out here gettin money
Tryna get paid
We just out here gettin money
Tryna get paid
Tryna tryna get paid
Tryna tryna get paid
We just out here gettin money
Tryna get paid
We just out here gettin money
Tryna get paid
We just out here gettin money
Tryna get paid
Tryna get paid
Tryna tryna get paid[x4]

[Verse 4:]
A Yo Fuse
It’s time to get this money man
Yo we just out here tryna get paid
Yo
I’m out here getting money
Duckin the heat like shade
I’m just tryna get paid
More than minimum wage
I need money to burn
Call it my paper planes
Get the flow off my dollaz
Like the blood in my veins
In love with that green color
Call it my Mary Jane
They wanna exchange change
For the words on this page
I promise to fill the cut
Salute to the dead pres
The dollaz all that I trust
On payday I go nuts for green
My dry skin when its time to get big
You know that I’m clocked in

[Chorus:]
We just out here gettin money
Tryna get paid
We just out here gettin money
Tryna get paid
We just out here gettin money
Tryna get paid
Tryna tryna get paid[x2]
We just out here gettin money
Tryna get paid
We just out here gettin money
Tryna get paid
We just out here gettin money
Tryna get paid
Tryna tryna get paid
Tryna tryna get paid (echoes)
