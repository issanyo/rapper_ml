[Verse 1]
If I could travel in time, I would go back and save Big L from the nine
I would go to the future, cop things that don't exist
Bring them back and give them to all the poor kids
I'd go back to 1933
Assassinate Hitler and let the people free
Then I'd go back to '68
In Memphis, Tennessee on that terrible day
And warn Dr. King about his enemy
And then I'd do the same thing for Kennedy
I'd go and take Jesus right off the cross
And put a stop to all religious wars
Get in my DeLorean before they drill
And warn BP about the oil spill
I'd tell the president "The war's over pal,"
And bring every American soldier home now

[Hook]
I'm travelin', time travelin'
I'mma change the world and come back again
Can you imagine it?
[x2]

[Verse 2]
I'd pull the fire alarm at the World Trade
So all those innocent people would have been safe
I'd put a bullet in Saddam Hussein
With the Glock, put a stop to his terrible ways
And I know it sounds remorseless
But I'd make Barbara Bush get an abortion
And that would have been important
Cuz we could have saved a lot of coffins
Take all the Republicans out of office
Cuz most of them are monsters
Man, I'd be going bonkers
Put myself on the bill at the first rap concert
I would have told Mike Tyson to cancel his fight
Cuz his homie 2Pac was gonna lose his life
And tell B.I.G. to cancel his show
Cuz mad bullets gonna be flying through his car door
And I'd tell Aaliyah to cancel the flight
So her and Dame could be chilling on their wedding night
Just imagine it
I'mma hop in this phone booth--time travelin'

[Hook]
