[Verse 1: Ea$y Money]
Y'all better salute a G and act right when you see me
It's real just more than what we recite in a CD
You fighting with Ea$y I'm lighting a DE
The flare from that shit'll give you vitamin D, B
We put them biscuits straight through ribs
That'll give you the business, no patronage
And we all love them hoodrats
Difference is your bitches get ratchet
We fuck with them bitches with ratchets
You grip it and flash it
Would you click it and clack it?
Are you quicker to pass it
To your nigga to blast it?
Homie we come through and airing the place
Flipping your head, that's not keeping your hair in place
Bunch of niggas from the streets who get it
Lead through with it
The steel jam, fuck it we gon' beat you with it
Uh, the game out of the same cat that'll hug you
Will aim at you then let your brain splatter
Like you ain't matter

[Verse 2: Hectic]
Hey yo it's S to the T dot
Family in attendance
Pray to the Lord but no more for repentance
I'm repping to my team 'til death be my sentence
Speak in diagrams but y'all can't comprehend it
The streets are hectic
Burn rubber like contraceptives
You got a question?
Spit flames to teach a lesson
There's no contesting
Homies killers with comprehension
I'm a law town nigga that rebel with no question
Projection screen niggas
Your TV funny
My terminology hectic, ask Ea$y money
Practice the art of sin when I snuck in the club
And got a clip all up in your mug
Got blood on the rug
I got a sleeper and a couple of snubs
Say something if you trying to thug
You bitch nigga
It's S-T and we up in the cut
Snitch niggas catch the butt of the gun you bitch nigga

[Verse 3: Termanology]
Reality is seeing and doing and not waiting
The more daydreaming, the making procrastinations
Every day pass, the opportunity you could of wasted
You woke up and saw your face, it could have been amazing
The shit is you're so lazy, so quick to get wavy
But can't take the time out to pick up your own baby
Look me in the eyes
If you got something to say to me
I woke up and grinded everyday, and waited patiently
Hopped out the booth
And showed rappers they couldn't play with me
Rappers double as famous they shook to step on the stage with me
This only confirms my suspicion they was afraid of me
Speeding through life
Push you out your lane, trying to race with me
I break bread with those that break bread with me
You bringing nothing to the table homie, how you gon' eat?
So you asking me to take a plate from my daughter
Cause you never got on your grind
Man you out of your mind
Grow up
