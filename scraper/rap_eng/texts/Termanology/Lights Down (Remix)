[Hook:]
I'm a turn the bass up, you can turn the lights down
If you ain't had enough, you gon get it right now
Get it right now, get it right now
If you ain't had enough, you gon get it right now
Get it (get it) like now, get it like now
Turn the (turn the) the bass up, you can turn the lights down
If you ain't had enough, you gon get it right now
If you ain't had enough, you gon get it right now

[Verse 1:]
Damn right: I'm from a city you ain't never heard about
Wasn't making noise then, but I'm making noise now
Making dope shit, what I'm all about
I'm Wu Tang in '93, fans like my shit loud
And I made my mama proud, turn the TV on, wow
She just clicking through the channels while she's sitting on the couch
There I is, it's time to celebrate now
You can tell the bartender we gonna need another round (it's going down)
In and out of labels all the time
Had to change up my ideas, had to switch up my designs
Went from dreams of being major to the independent grind
When you come to think about it man I'm doing just fine
Cause I'm that YouTube and I'm on that iPod
And that girl up in the front row screaming 'my God! '
Big up to my fans and all of my squad
You can call me what you want, just call me an icon

[Hook:]
I'm a turn the bass up, you can turn the lights down
If you ain't had enough, you gon get it right now
Get it right now, get it right now
If you ain't had enough, you gon get it right now
Get it (get it) like now, get it like now
Turn the (turn the) the bass up, you can turn the lights down
If you ain't had enough, you gon get it right now
If you ain't had enough, you gon get it right now

[Verse 2:]
Sometimes it's just me and my subwoofer, the lows
A life can leave you rattled and shattered and yes it shows
The high don't come as often as my TV screen
With fallin I called the search off of my meaning
I guess I just proceed to crawl on the curb
Caddy-cornered Cadillacs, the aftermath erotic
Clean, this ho don't know just how to act
Every day's a new country, I don't know just how to pack
Indestructible flow, bitch I don't know how to crack
Under pressure, since Wechsler, on the ball court
Destined to be a major leaguer even as a small sport
Never was for the alrights, or the almost
If you ain't gon make it count, what you askin for the ball for?
Shuckin jives, stickin move out my way, I got shit to do
One more time for country bumpkins, we ain't got shit to prove
Lyrical, mobster in my own right
I had to be a king in my past life
Krizzle

[Hook:]
I'm a turn the bass up, you can turn the lights down
If you ain't had enough, you gonna get it right now
Get it right now, get it right now
If you ain't had enough, you gonna get it right now
Get it (get it) like now, get it like now
Turn the (turn the) the bass up, you can turn the lights down
If you ain't had enough, you gonna get it right now
If you ain't had enough, you gonna get it right now

Turn the bass up
Turn the lights down
Right now
Right now
Get it like now
