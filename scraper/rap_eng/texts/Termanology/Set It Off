[Verse 1: Termanology]
The size of the check
Can tell you if you live or die
Smoke that official la
My weed's crystalized
Three for twenty-fives
Dimes and hold pizza pies
My reefer's lime
It give me the Wiz Khalifa eyes
Step on stage, make 'em catch the holy ghost
Turn fans to cutties and make 'em overdose
And fuck school, nah I never had the plumber hose
Pour a drink on your dead body, now that's a comatose
These little bullies what stole your pulaw
Now I can't sing my man, I can't hold a note
But I move coast to coast, bags full of coke and dope
My whole fam's street, you would think I roll with Los
You be home the most, never where the toasters blow
I'ma be the first dealer on the Oprah show
Covered in 'lo with a Freddy mask
You want to see this bitch again I need a milli cash

[Refrain: Termanology]
Set it off (repeated)
Allah G, Short Fuse
Came to set it off
Gimme the change and I'm off

[Verse 2: Termanoloy]
Got a bubble butt big booty bitch in heels
Raking in dollar bills 'cause she move my pills
Man for real, you know how the cannon feel
It turn the man of steel into a banana peel
Banana clips moved on banana boats
Smuggled in with the dope
I got the anticdote
For your needs just take one of these
Feel the rush like a high speed chase with thieves
Blackberry business man, Bank of America
Bringing them big bills to a teller on the regulars
Never a competitor, there's no competition
'Cause I'm the illest rapper in Law town's existence
You in a bad position
You the third nicest in your clique
And me I'm the nicest in my city
Text messages pouring in about my excellence
How much for a feature? Double what you pay in rent

[Refrain: Termanology]
Set it off (repeated)
You know the name
Goya
S-T dot
So um, hip hop to the core
We set it off
Hey yo Ransom set it off

[Verse 3: Ransom]
A murderous weapon
Like hollow tips I insert in the Wesson
Verbal aggression, every nerd'll be nervous and stressing
Learn 'em a lesson, I'm superb when I burn in a session
See my expression, my profession is surgical blessings
John Gotti swag, shotty blast, body bags
Know this nigga probably laugh 'til he take a polygraph
And now I'm 'bout to set it off
A snake'll always be a snake until the head is off
Set it off, serve it like Fedorov
Metaphors metamorph
Into a demon and I'm scheming to knock the devil off
A mental assassin who cashed in
Ya'll niggas is missing the passion, I passed ten
On the richtor scale, had to sit in jail
'Cause I don't Crip and tell
Strip 'em like Chippendale
A nigga with an attitude, I'm as bad as Cube
Minus the jerry curl nigga I'm very thorough

[Outro: Termanology]
Set it off (repeated)
Well there you have it ladies and gentleman
Give it up for Termanology, Ransom
Short Fuse on the beat
The incredible DJ Statik Selektah on the cuts
We set it off
Hey yo Statik take us out son
(Set it off)
