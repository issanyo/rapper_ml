[Intro]:
1,2,3,4, 1,2...3,4!
Hop, hop, hop, hop, hip

Sound off (1, 2)
Once again (3, 4)
Sound off (1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2...3, 4!)

[Verse One] [Oh No]:
Black hoodies up
Wrappin' the hands up
Glass on the fists
Tell them niggas stand up
Man up
See the ambulance van on stand by
Videotape so you can see how your man died
Random thoughts that just ran by ya
Starin' at a motherfuckin' butcher like a lamb's eye
And you a lamb chop
There is no beef
Tough talk ends with broke teeth
Shit, I'll lace a blunt with keef
And get deeper than the seven seas
Put you through the depths of Hell, watch Heaven leave
You need weapons and cheese, fuckin' with these
Reppin' the peace, get X'd by excellent Gs
Your excellence please, they fallin' to they knees
I can hear them callin' my sleep
Some shit kings dream
Make it hot for ya, easily provide the steam clean
They call Term to come street sweep out your team
Nigga

[Hook] [Ea$y Money]:
"Sound Off"
My true heads, let this shit knock
Snap your neck and spazz out to this hip hop
"Sound off"
We heatin' up the spot and my peoples got the Glock
Trust me, you don't wanna hear it
"Sound off"
We here to move the crowd
And we like the music loud
We don't ever want to turn the
"Sound off"
It's Oh No, and the 'Olo-
-Gy, S.T. and them west side riders

[Verse Two] [Termanology]:
I would've had my man smack you with the pound dawg
But you scared of your own shadow like a groundhog
Pussy, I throw punches like Balrog
Fuck around have you layin' on the ground dawg
Shiiiiit
I'm down for the action
Everybody on my team shoot, no passin'
I'm Kobe, I'm Mike, I'm Lebron
Your Roley, your ice, my arm
Your wife, my palm on her ass bastard
I know you don't like that song
C'mon
Let's all sing along
I got a couple guns that sing like Akon
Cause they all black and they make hits
And you don't really wanna see them shits turn on
I got a short fuse like Bonaduce
Every other city drop babies on a groupie
Blazin' on a doobie
Razor cut jewelry
My shawty ill cause she half Asian with a booty
Like Kimora Lee, more me, what they want in 'em
Orgies every week, triz I'm throwin' victims
I got that fish scale but I don't do fishin'
Love my peeps in jail but I don't do prison
I'm on a new mission that don't include pitchin'
Dude listen I'm tryin' to sit in a ?

[Hook]
