[Intro]
There's nothing familiar about the way they talk or look
Or even the way they worship their creator
They may be American but they're not like you at all
We made a wild and wonderful record for you
We tell you all kinds of things to do and be and you can let your imagination go

[Hook]
"Recognize"
"The real"
"Who wan' to test the real scandalous?"
"Recognize, do I have to prove all the time?
And get up close and personal in front of your eyes"
"Recognize"
"The real scandalous"
"Who wan' to test the real scandalous?"
"Recognize, do I have to prove all the time?"
"When it come to money, dunn, I'm not the one to laugh with"

[Verse One: Termanology]
You better recognize
I don't give a fuck about a record deal, I wreck you guys
Plus I specialize in murking you out with special knives
Tec's and nines, next in line
Who wanna get it, I known to spit it with the best alive
I murder stages and murder pages like murder cases
Rip out your vertebraes and your brain with my dirty razors
I went to thirty mages invaded 'em with my lasers
Told 'em about it this independent gun that I'm blazing
Fuck a record deal
For the record I've been living wreckless
I'll clutch your diamond necklace off your neck and I'll flex it
Then I fled to the exit, I hope you catching the message
I got a necklace the size of Treach's just to wreck ya flesh with
We straight scandalous, handing out brain damages
Cats pulling banana clips
Bats, bullets and bandages
The brand is Goya me partna' now you wanna cop?
Unless you cop
Then it's 1-800-COP-SHOT

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Chris Rivers]
Ain't nothing humorous
Crucifix ya ludicrous movement
I'm way too lucrative, I move with this translucent improvement
Only the mic can pass, lightning fast
By the time that you wipe your ass
Need to calculate infinity to fathom the mic's I grasp
Your mind relapsed
Perhaps, from the way that I write these raps
Attack I blaze each track with the force of a 1,000 stars collapsed
Novas and quasars
Soldier and eight bars
Sixteen I'm Elohim, nebulous status, I make stars
I stay charged
Ripping the force out of black holes
You don't get my space reference
Suck a corpse out an asshole
You dumb fuck
I guess you should've died as a tadpole
But since you're here now, go hang yourself on a flagpole
I'm joking
I'm all about that peace and equality
Preaching philosophy
Word to law for reading astrology
Leading this odyssey journey from the depths that I constantly
Turn in hypocrisy, logically and fuck this economy

[Hook]
"Recognize"
"The real"
"Who wan' to test the real scandalous?"
"Recognize, do I have to prove all the time?
And get up close and personal in front of your eyes"
"Recognize"
"The real scandalous"
"Who wan' to test the real scandalous?"
"Recognize, do I have to prove all the time?"
"When it come to money, dunn, I'm not the one to laugh with"

[Verse 3: Ras Kass]
I can't risk doing a California cop coroner, scandalous
Spit my manifesto but I won't die in the cabin bitch
Advantages like battleship blasting the Vegas strip
Explode Mazeratis, that'll kill your magic quick
Got my Spanglish, key to my Spanish is
Tu [?] es grande, I hang with the savages
Fuck that romantic shit, I rather a ratchet bitch
That fuck niggas and chop your head off, praying mantises
I'm Los Angeles street analyst
The green better stack
Or I'ma turn a terrorist speaking Arabic
Likes the Subway, foot long shit sandwiches
That's why I chain smoke, got more humps than a camel's clique
I'm on Goya shit, platanos and cannabis
Rice and beans, Merengue on tracks I lean
Like p-p-prome and that's G
I sell red bottoms to a double amputee
Recognize nigga
