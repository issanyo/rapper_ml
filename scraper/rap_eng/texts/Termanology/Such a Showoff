Cannibalism, exorcisms and holocausts
Colt 45, Tec 9 and Molotov
I'm Hussein, spitting out butane
So every single day I'm just sparking a new flame
I load up my chopper like I just finished a rescue mission
Load up my pockets then go buy a duster put the piffin
Killer Gaddafi my flow is cocky, I'm kamikaze
I'd rather get shot with a shotty than go back to prison
Top of the morning, hop to in my lungy portions
Money calling you toss...organs
Parents calling, bitch niggas I sniff liquors
I smoke henessey, broke...parallel spaces
After them day ships, still sleeping
Take 6, ... seasaw back and forth...forever showing off
I'm such a showoff, I'm such a showoff
I'm such a showoff, I'm such a showoff
I'm such a showoff, I'm such a showoff
It's a long fall, standing on pride, filled with ... inside
Need to ... some pals, never come around
... keep your eyes on the ball, let it bounce where it may
Plus the fewer... smell like an ounce of haze
Count the ways of manipulation and deception
Get you stressing, everything you work for in question
Hey yo, it's 5 am, 4,5,6
...you couldn't emcee, if your name was emcee
These emcees better...when I empty girls
I'm a diabolic, psychopathic, malladic, emcee killer
... for trying to creep better
Your boy turn my rock like Carlos Santana
You couldn't twist up a knot in Pac's bandana
I'm such a showoff, I'm such a showoff
I'm such a showoff, I'm such a showoff
I'm such a showoff, I'm such a showoff
I'm such a showoff, I'm such a showoff
