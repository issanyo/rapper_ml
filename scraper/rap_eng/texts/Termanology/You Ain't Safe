Feat. Inspectah Deck & Maffew Ragazino
This ain’t no music for the club or you cats in love
This is music for my bugged out goons on drugs
I make music for the creeps that should be 6 feet
A new Bentley made it out by the skin in they teeth
And they be already stealing ready for beef
In the...building having a feast
Eating good of my criminal mind and crime biz
Leave my checks and food stamps the same thing
It’s thanksgiving in my hood like everyday
Lot of thirst game cut lot of full game ate
And you ain't’ safe roaming in the same place
Putting yo hands on everybody’s money like the bank
Putting yo hands on everybody money get you shot
I’m the one you could thank bang bang white toddler
Yo bank and ball on ‘em keep ‘em guttered like my cousin
You ain’t safe cause you got a gun in your safe
You ain’t safe cause you gonna run when it takes
You ain’t safe tryna find a new pace
Lot of fun in yo place you can get done it from lace
You ain’t safe cause you got a gun in your safe
You ain’t safe cause you gonna run when it takes
You ain’t safe tryna find a new pace
Lot of fun in yo place you can get done it from lace
You ain’t safe come through cover yo face
You ain't sky free cause you got freedom the case
You ain’t G you got 3 niggers running up state
Take my niggers that will come through papa’s yo weight
See’em lying in the stand Benedict
Wise man throw yo ax up bias in the can
18 watching from the van
About to drop you dropping up the spot while you’re dropping out the van
APB on yo head in every hood
EMT on the set is never good blood spilled
Pick him up he gotta post still
That’s Karma brought it up a duck tale
Informer, duck tape, riot at chest
Going up turn page right up on yo desk
You ain’t safe cause you got a gun in your safe
You ain’t safe cause you gonna run when it takes
You ain’t safe tryna find a new pace
Lot of fun in yo place you can get done it from lace
You ain’t safe cause you got a gun in your safe
You ain’t safe cause you gonna run when it takes
You ain’t safe tryna find a new pace
Lot of fun in yo place you can get done it from lace
Money don’t make you safe you want
Kevlar vest without a gun on yo waist
And yo cup diesel buddy go with skinny
But when a bag check when they commence the beating
Now you’re on a world star humping
Black and blue like a paramour save the J
What a disgrace to your neighborhood
You can’t even show yo face in yo neighborhood
And you grew up there nigga
Fuck ass nigga you grew up square nigga
Get a blue nose pin if you scared nigga
This war outside
Should’ve been more prepared nigga
The more I let the story and start bluffing
Like they toughen your racks but really want nothing
Ain’t no future in front nigga
The future for nothing
Is wear you do it for nothing
You ain’t safe cause you got a gun in your safe
You ain’t safe cause you gonna run when it takes
You ain’t safe tryna find a new pace
Lot of fun in yo place you can get done it from lace
You ain’t safe cause you got a gun in your safe
You ain’t safe cause you gonna run when it takes
You ain’t safe tryna find a new pace
Lot of fun in yo place you can get done it from lace
