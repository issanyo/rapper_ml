(Verse 1 Typ iLL)
I'm counter effective with my weapon on safety
I switch the selection to fire
Renegade for higher I blaze thee
Keep the remote close
Flip the channel when I wanna flip it
From a young buck fast forward to a grown folk
Ducking Narcs up in my younger days
D's pulling up in hummer trucks 24 inch gold spokes
Back of the CVS alleyway
My Memory flash flash bang in my enemy's path as they retaliate
My peoples will lock and load pop it till I unload
Switch up this magazine not a comic book episode
But I'm flipping pages as quick as I'm pumping gauges I blow
Militant in my body I'm diligent when I roll
Daz Dillinger Johnny Depp a promise not a threat
My feelings is 4 wheeling I'm peeling on any set Playa!
Where my friends at they not around
When I needed that voice of reason (shh) not a sound
So when my people tell me Typ you gotta make it
I reply with this record for all my fans who be putting me in their playlist
Came with a crew full of young hyped teens
A few outcasts and pill heads with young pipe dreams
I find it hard to knock it But opposition got no option
But the ? is what I'm bringing to the table for a profit
I won't stop this until I'm dead
I do this rap shit for war vets and hip hop heads

(Verse 2 Termanology)
There's a war going on outside no man is safe from
In your mental its not coincidental
I done looked death in the eyes plenty of times
When you find yourself stumbling on enemy lines
See the flames and the fire reflecting off of your retina
Its obvious you sold your soul I raise my weapon up
Cause I'm trying to take what ever soul you have left
Your man try to roll up then he fin to get shot next
A leader but I'm humble these streets is like a puzzle
So you gotta keep your eyes peeled creeping through the jungle
My cousin went to jail for packing heat and moving bundles
Its easy to judge when you ain't see that man struggle
I'm focused on my goal that's living as long as I can live
Sometimes I feel hopeless choke up and think about my kids
I swear a must have been a warrior in my past life
Same scars on my back swear I been stabbed twice
Nightmares every night fighting that good fight
Stabbed him a 100 times that was under the moonlight
His soul is possessed put a hole in his chest
In fact you can leave that mess for the EMS
It's all about residuals and what you can leave
If you die a broke man you ain't do shit for your seed
Thank society go head judge me on my sobriety
But if you gone tell it tell the story entirely
