[Intro]
A yo put my lucky bamboo in the corner
Yeah that’s good and light the incense the vanilla one
Yeah and slide the goldfish over here they bring me wealth

[Verse 1: Nitty Scott]
Hold up, slowed up, couple dope chicks when we showed up
They want to kick it with my breezy clique
I’m only rockin’ with them if they in the Stevie Nicks
They was with it, frequency off the meter
Cop the reefer then we took them to auntie Maria’s
And we rollin’ while we smokin’
He said this shit gon have you coastin’
I started laughing is you jokin’
Boy I be tokin’ you ain’t never see me chokin’
Uh, now we dozing on the potion
And I done took Frank up out the ocean
Uh, you know I roll that fatty perfectly
Make it purply in my nursery
And all my paper planes boarded
Distorted on the strain that they imported
Smell the orchids, see in my orbit
Vibes never die they are only transported

[Hook] x2
Ay, and I’m just on my Feng Shui
Give a damn what a muthafuckin’ hater got to say
And I’m just on my Feng Shui

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
And we live from a cloud of kush
I was puffing on that loud and you a sour puss
Been on my indie I don’t need a push
And I ain’t no disciple but I burn the bush
Rhyme garden, mind sharpen
Mining cause there’s diamonds in this fine jargon
From a cubby on the subway to gettin’ props from the popular it’s so lovely
Runway just a Monday it ain’t the bubbly it’s the Feng Shui
Yes I be aesthetically fresh abundantly blessed
And I’m passin’ blunts to the left

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nitty Scott]
And tell Ab to bring the backwoods
I ain’t into swisher no more, that shit is that good
And we ain’t even gotta act hood
Speaking abstract to the facts the way that rap should
Take a pull we make these hood blocks
Turn into a new age Woodstock
Cause you know that older wild stinky
Girl you so pretty when your eyes chinky
Flight school grad it’s a celebration
For all my dedication to this aviation
Face like uh oh when the weed runnin’ low
Cop me so more and don’t fuck up my flow
Cause I know the whole team got to blow
And I don’t love these hoes blowin’ O’s at my show
All up in my grill like where you been at
Man I’m all up in my chill like where your zen at
It’s just the people that I came with
People that I change with it’s all how you arrange it

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ayo where my crystals at
I gotta recharge my crystals B
Let’s do beige in the northeast you know earth tones
All white in the west get my creativity up
And no mirrors in the south none whatsoever
It’s bad chi respect the Feng shui man
What up Ski
