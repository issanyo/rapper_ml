[Verse 1: Nitty Scott]
Nitty came to spit it and kick it like Kung Fu
See, I could off your whole catalog with a 1-2
Pop dumb lyrical puns with a fun crew
Better step your rhyme up when I come through
Droppin bombs like Saddam
Who's sane? Not me
The way I lose my noggin in hollin the melody
The people say Church to the O.N.E
So you lookin like Satan to a God MC
I'm tired of these Rap shenanigans
I wanna be a fan again
Don't nobody want another mannequin
My bars got casualties
I catch em casually
Word-vomit on the mic, don't touch it after me B
Cos that would be unsanitary
Oh Snap, it's the real life rap Halle Berry
I think I'm better now I think I'm Coretta
Get a Circa 9-0
Nitty Scott in the Center

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
You probably watchin like "Man, I never heard of him"
"I'll murder him, the nerve of him rockin' with pre-premiere
That's so absurd of him"
Wait until he spit a couple verbs and 'em
If you really want to hate
Wait, he got the word with him
I heard him holla Jesus the notorious
No, the most glorious homie
So laborious boring us with these choruses
Horrible let us go it's just killing us
Call the coroner
Unimpressively floorin' us
Hey this what happen when hip hop let the saints in
Tailored to snatch the mic swiftly like Ye did
But them awards can't follow you to the grave
You livin for them whips and chains? Then you a slave
Prayer don't stop time, it kills hours
They lookin for a saviour, but we killed ours
Still he rose like Derrick, no bull
You wanna meet the Lord? Come holla, I got pull

[Verse 3: Soprano] (English translation)
One minute, gimme a minute
Right before my flow starts
I wanted to say to my friends from Marseille
That from now on, sky's the limit
I check the beat, unfurl my lyrics with my flow and loads of gimmicks
Call me Christopher, and today
I came to conquer America
Don't panic, I'm no terrorist
Except when this is about releasing killer verse
Like bomb atomic
As cold a rap as Alaska, master, I'm high like a Rasta
Insane as old dirty bastard, brutish in bed like DSK
Gimme a moment sista, let me print my style
In the States with a sturdy flow
The stars end up at the E. R
Statistics will show I'm unbelievable like Nicki's butt
I'm your boss from elsewhere, find yourself a job
Elsewhere, you stain my neat suit, the one from psycatra
I'm a boss nigga hun hallelujah!
You see, I'm not from here like E.T
My name is Soprano, a french guy on B.E.T

[Verse 4: Estelle]
So can I rap?
I'm looking at this clock and this clock's steady tickin'
Tryna find the words but the word's gone missin'
Whatcha talkin' bout when the world's inconsistent?
Cause everyone's shifting, yeah, everyone's shifting
I came to America, my shoes and my dream
My deal in my pocket or that's how it seemed
I lived in the hood so I wasn't going back
You see, I did all of that so then my struggle's in tact
I've been shared a room with some rats and some bees
I've been one pair of shoes where my toes would freeze
You see it doesn't matter if I ain't from here
The same shit, different currency, be clear
But here's the real real though
We're all young and getting up
Trying to be better than that bullshit they been givin' us
Got to be better than, have to be better than
90% of the bullshit they be selling us
It's hunger; got one Grammy
Need like 10 more for me to really act shabby
So I'mma say it loud, and I'mma say it proud
Make ya say my name, say my name out loud
Elle!
