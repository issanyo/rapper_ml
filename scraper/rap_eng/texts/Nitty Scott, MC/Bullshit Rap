[Intro: Sample + Nitty Scott]
"He came up to me with some bull---- rap—"
"You need to cut it out 'cause it's all in your mind"
Boombox Family
("—a fly MC don't never have to bite—")
Uh, his name's Nitty Scott MC
It's just the way I was raised, y'all
("You need to cut it out 'cause it's all in your mind")


[Hook]
"He came up to me with some bull---- rap—"
"He came up to me with some bull---- rap—"
"He came up to me with some bull---- rap—"
"So when he came up to me, I told him to step back"

[Verse 1]
Yo, I was the best kept secret till I leaked it
Flow seasick, then I peaced it like a beatnik
Last of the the Mohicans, get to geeking when I free-kick
B-R-double-O-K-lyn street shit
Bozo with my nine, oh-oh
Rapped around my pretty little finger like a yo-yo
Know we got that good 'dro, sticky like a moco
Flicking on them bics now my eyes all rojo
I give a damn about a hater
They want me like candy—baby, Now and Later
So please, don't approach me with a bullshit rhyme
I don't do battles—there's too many free lines

[Hook]
"He came up to me with some bull---- rap—"
"He came up to me with some bull---- rap—"
"He came up to me with some bull---- rap—"
"So when he came up to me, I told him to step back"

[Verse 2]
Yo, these retail-ass rappers such a gimmick
Sucker emcees trying to tell me how to spit it
I ain't with it, catch me in the cypher with the nice-type
I get some hype, you can't even hold the mic right
Verbals murder for the herbals
Vocabulary hurdles, hold weight like a verdal
Industry rule number four-thousand-and-eighty;
Record company people are shady
I never let this game turn me to a clown
They so afraid of heights, trying to be down
So step back, ya'll, it's like that, ya'll
We represent for hip-hop, and not for rap, ya'll

[Hook]
"He came up to me with some bull---- rap—"
"He came up to me with some bull---- rap—"
"He came up to me with some bull---- rap—"
"So when he came up to me, I told him to step back"

[Verse 3]
It's true; I get the audience thicker than a Snicker
Sweet-faced spitter, you can miss me with the glitter
Kicked a little rap now they on me like a tack
And I gotta make moves like a military brat
Matter fact, listen; I'm a born-star
Wouldn't give a flying fuck on the airplane with a porn star
Roar, fee-fi-fo-fum
I'm a five-two giant and these rappers so yum
My God, yes, I live in my pod
Armed with the facts, I rap your whole iPod
Then Nitty be like, "Hello, city"
To your city, then your city be like, "Hello, Nitty"

[Hook]
"He came up to me with some bull---- rap—"
"He came up to me with some bull---- rap—"
"He came up to me with some bull---- rap—"
"So when he came up to me, I told him to step back"
