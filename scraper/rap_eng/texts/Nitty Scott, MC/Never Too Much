Verse 1 (Donwill)

Whole lotta nothin
Braggin bout it ain't no kinda stuntin
But without much still had you
And thats everything i need to get through
No placebo, and when the bad days repo my ego
Its like comin home sippin something strong with my weed rolled
And i don't even smoke
So not havin much never really mattered much
We from the same cloth matchin in the pattern
Prolly get it not even no how to handle it
Im from the bottom and just want my hands on it
Crabs in a barrel drizzle em with drawn butter
Brand new apparel killin em in all colors
A van to a pair of shows tourin all summer
A grammy to shelve right next to my diploma
It ain't shit to me because some wins are empty victories
And even though i could use all of those
Its a whole lotta nothin if i lose my soul so...
