[Verse]
I woke up in a wilderness today
A place my mind could not remember but my soul already knew
No longer searching for a steady breeze
There is soil on my skin and saltwater in my blood
A descendant of God
I feel as if I am sunshine with a pulse
I bare my fertile flower from which humanity originates
Rivers of milk flow from me and I watch as entire kingdoms bow
All the children are here barefoot in the morning
And the dirt is rich with many treasures
Vamos a la playa, you are free to transcend
You are free to be Creature and you are free to bend
