[Intro]
Yeah, Uh-huh
Yeah, Uh-huh
Ayo this for Leia, Samantha, [?]
All my siblings man, I love y’all

[Verse 1: Nitty Scott, MC]
Uh
What up young girl, I know it's been a minute
Since you've got the chance to see yourself in other women
Everything is driven by your given image
The illusion is confusing and your head is spinning (Uh)
But listen this ain't feminism
I just want to talk to you, I ain't competition
Don't want to take your man
Don't want to flash the glam
Ain't here to tell you that I'm better, let your mind expand
You see I come in peace for my niece
And all my little sisters trying to make it in the streets (Yeah)
You ain't limited to posing on a car
So open up and show them all the Venus that you are
Cause in your eyes lies a beautiful surprise
Realize it and keep reaching for the skies
If God is willing and the creek don't rise
One day it won't be about the heat between our thighs
But in the mean time just hit a sweet rhyme
And empower you power in these unique times
Thought it was a fairytale dream
But baby girl you are real life queen
A real life queen

[Chorus: Sam B]
Who are we?
Family
If you need me
Know you got me
All your life (Forever)
Just want to see you shine  (Forever)
Like you’re a star
Cause you’re a star
And you deserve everything
And you deserve everything
Yeah Yeah


[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
Yo, I wrote this for Keke, ‘Drea, Bailey
Even though your uncle make moves like Alvin Ailey
Hitting in out of state, adding acres to estates
I do what I do to ease the burden on your plates
You're my queens, supreme human beings
Never let a man tell you that you need him
Cause you have a father if you need something
And then you have an uncle if you want something
I want to raise you up like royalty
The less fortunate will call you spoiled. See, (that’s what they do)
I know how this game go (how it go)
I just want to provide you different angles
Little angels, wishing that you could stay this way forever
But forever's never long enough
No, forever don't belong to us
I know you want to grow up, but there's no need to rush (slow down)
I take you to a restaurant, we sitting down
We getting in the car, open doors how?
Any man would ever treat you less then
When you've been shown love by your own kin

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Nitty Scott, MC]
Uh, uh
And it’s okay, it’s okay
I know you gotta find your own way, your own way
But baby girl, why they focus on your gender?
It’s cool like December, find your center and remember
To love your body, it was yours from the start
Such a perfect vessel, view it as a work of art
Uh-huh, don’t mind the faces or the races that you came with
Cause your confidence will be a fashion statement
Never let a man abuse you or use you
He reduce you? Well then he gotta lose you
Kiss your grandmother, and your mother too
Cause its love for you that make ‘em want to smother you
Uh, and make that money for yourself, love
Get your own, don’t depend on no one else, love
Further life cycles when you bloom
Divine in your design to carry life in your womb
Little sister

[Chorus]
