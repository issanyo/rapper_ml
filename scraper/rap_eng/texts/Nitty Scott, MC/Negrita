[First Verse]
It's very necessary, but I'm in a cemetery
Niggas really scary, but they really temporary
Santeria heavy, have them seeing little fairies
And I just hit the Mary so my vision kinda blurry

[Hook]
Like uh
So down mamacita
Muy bonita, they calling me negrita
(Uuh) the eyes like chinita
Issa rap like fajita chiquita

Now watch me back up on ya, bout to back upon ya
Watch me watch me back up on ya, 'bout to back upon ya
Watch me watch me back up on ya, 'bout to back upon ya
Watch me watch me back up on ya, 'bout to back upon ya

[Second Verse]
And she like Noreaga, little queen of the bodega
? Vega, throw it back like it was Sega
Her papi be the plug, and her mama from Granada
She said dime dimelo, but she never do no favors

And hay la negrita she winding up the time
Tropical arranger (?) after la lengua
Bi ba ba di da
She like the way up up up
Sigue la sigue la negrita

[Hook]
Like uh
So down mamacita
Muy bonita, they calling me negrita
(Uuh) the eyes like chinita
Issa rap like fajita chiquita

Now watch me back up on ya, bout to back upon ya
Watch me watch me back up on ya, 'bout to back upon ya
Watch me watch me back up on ya, 'bout to back upon ya
Watch me watch me back up on ya, 'bout to back upon ya

[Instrumental]

[Third Verse]
This is for my sweet amaretto mu√±equas in the ghetto
Roses on the concrete, rollers in your pelo
Prices got finessed, defenses off her man
She was born with Spanish Harlem in the palm of her hand
Un poquito poquito and pero like
Call La Goya, LaToya and whip it right
We gon' hit the botanica, find a candle delight
Ay que rico nenita, we got 'em chicas tonight

Now watch me back up on ya, bout to back upon ya
Watch me watch me back up on ya, 'bout to back upon ya
Watch me watch me back up on ya, 'bout to back upon ya
Watch me watch me back up on ya, 'bout to back upon ya

Now watch me back up on ya, bout to back upon ya
Watch me watch me back up on ya, 'bout to back upon ya
Watch me watch me back up on ya, 'bout to back upon ya
Watch me watch me back up on ya, 'bout to back upon ya
