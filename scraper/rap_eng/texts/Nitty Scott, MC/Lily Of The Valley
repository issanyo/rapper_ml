[Hook: Sene]
Damn, it’s beautiful ain’t it
All these wood boxes of flower arrangement
Damn, it’s beautiful ain’t it
All these kids shoots when ain’t nobody aiming

[Verse 1: Nitty Scott]
She beautiful ain’t she her vision amazing
A rose in the pavement it’s just entertainment
That’s what she tried to tell herself as she’s naked for payment
Patient is ? her faith is erasing
She talk to god before she hit the stage
Know she in a sea of rage
But she gotta see a wage
False idols become in vital
This is survival or suicidal
When they make it rain
Them showers of pain
Numbing shots to the brain maybe keep her sane
Puffing cigarettes in a fishnet
Cause a visnet get sicker than a quick set
See the past he got pass on
Dance to the last song
Hope it don’t last long
Tryna make ends meet to get by
You a slave to the money then you die

[Hook: (Sene) & Nitty Scott]
(Damn it’s beautiful ain’t it
All these wood boxes of flower arrangement
Damn it’s beautiful ain’t it
All these kids shoots when ain’t nobody aiming)
Damn it’s beautiful ain’t it
All these gold crosses ain’t nobody praying
Damn it’s beautiful ain’t it
All your friends dying  and you hanging with strangers

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
She’s beautiful ain’t she, her case in the making
Her break is forsaken, her body is aching
But she never keep them waiting, she vacant for Satan
Begging for saving, her vision is fading
Now she higher than a heel on her stilettos
Girl from the ghetto is sweet like falsetto
Playing with her needs pull strings like they Geppetto
Was time to let go but she never got the memo
Tricking for a fix until she falls out
Another dog going south in a doll house
Tryna make ends meet to get high
You a slave to the feeling then you die

[Hook: (Sene) & Nitty Scott]

[Outro] x2
Every day I cry inside some more
I don’t know what I am fighting for
