Tumbl[HER] lyrics :

[ Hook : ]

I want her. I need her. She's on my dashboard have you seen her
She's a hipster I gotta meet her
She's a tumblr girl I want a tumblher [x2]

[ Verse 1: ]

Twinkle twinkle little star I wonder where you are
I wonder what you're doing and who are pursuing
What's your name and what's yours sign
And if I ever found you would you be mine
Do you like movies who's your favorite artist
Do you like candy what's your favorite flower
Tell me all your dreams I wanna know your fears
Do you think it's creepy that I keep you in my prayers
Are you into sports do you like the lakers
Who your favorite team or whose your favorite player
My friends think I'm crazy Kus I'm loopy for you
Scrolling down my dashboard looking for you

[ Verse 2 :]

Sugar honey ice tea the apple of my eye
I bet you from the city of angels in the sky
Where's your birthplace where's your fav city
Here's a sidenote I think your really pretty
How many hours would you spend on twitter
Do you believe in love  are you hurt are you bitter
What's your favorite book do you love  coffee
Favorite past time do you have any hobbies
Tell me all your secrets i wanna know your past
If I ever get you Do you think that we would last
My friends think I'm crazy Kus I'm loopy for you
Scrolling down my dashboard looking for you

[ Verse 3 : ]

Hol up, thought i saw a puddycat
Yeah, i be knowing where the goodies at baby girl, you a lil goody trap
& if i hit it you could never get ya cookie back
Mythical, digital honey
Taking my time and she taking my money
Lost in her land but i like it in here
And she know that she pulling this energy from me
Is it true that you like to play house?
I heard that you keepin' stars in your mouth
Can i come over and play in your flowers for hours 'till we asleep on the couch?
Come get in my dream world
You manic pixie dream girl, uh
And you could get the password to a nigga wifi anytime you need girl
