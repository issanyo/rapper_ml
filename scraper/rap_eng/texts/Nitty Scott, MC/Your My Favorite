[Intro: Nitty Scott]
Hey yo Ted there’s something bout this joint
Just makes me smile
I don’t know maybe it’s that
That it reminds me of somebody
My favorite somebody matter of fact

[Hook]
I said Oo Your My boom box lover
I said I need you on my arm
I said Oo Oo mmm boom box lover
Won’t you come be on My arm
I love you like my favorite song, favorite song
Love you like my favorite song
So go tell the DJ keep you on replay
All night long
Baby boy your my boom box lover

[Verse 1: Nitty Scott]
Now If music was mine
I would put him on a shrine
Do not disturb sign
While we dine on the fine
Wine of the finest vines and good pine
Combine our design
Let our spines intertwine
Cloud nine all the time and the sun while it shine
Bliss with the rhyme and it feel so divine
I’ll keep your secrets
Dropping lil love notes
Jones on the jacks while you
Laughing at my dumb jokes
And I’m your little red corvette
Only you can hop up in the diver seat like that
Fly like jets and you gots what I get
Cause only you can take it back
To burets and cassettes
Fuck me up like a cigarette
But I never break a sweat
Cause you the coolest that it’s gone get
But when you finish frontin like you want to keep it platonic
Just phone up and roll up like The Fire Chronicles

[Hook]
I said Oo Your My boom box lover
I said I need you on my arm
I said Oo Oo mmm boom box lover
Won’t you come be on my arm
I love you like my favorite song, favorite song
Love you like my favorite song
So go tell the DJ keep you on replay
All night long
Baby boy your my boom box lover

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
Ok
Bliss You blew me a kiss
I'm a put it in my pocket for the lips I'm a miss
You poppin' even if we ain't' poppin' it crisp
So come and kick it with your honey while we listen to this
So somehow you make me think I could fly
Make me hot like the sun-shine state in July
Got me giggling a little and I don’t know why
But these butterfly’s
Are Too dam hard To deny
Its the cry oh my caught more than my eye
Just the slight infatuation bout the size of the sky
And we can take it anywhere the shanti Dubai
W- I- f- e- y is I
And I know it ain't' perfect this life I live
But you got a way of making me believe it is
Get me all up out my shell like its show and tell
I know your smell never say farewell to your spell

[Hook x 2]
I said Oo Your My boom box lover
I said I need you on my arm

Love you like my favorite song

All night long
Baby boy your my boom box lover

[Nitty Scott]
I’m sayin'
Wouldn’t it be the perfect crime?
If I stole your heart and you stole mine
