Sure[Nitty Scott, MC]
It's a sound session; party in my head
Could've been a listener, rather rap instead
Could've sold divisions of a contradiction
But Nitty Scott realer than non-fiction
See I bend the track over, beat it like a drum
Finger fuck the English language 'til she cum
Put the rhythm to her nipple, tickle her syllables
Juicin' up her literal 'til all the similes trickle
And dribble where the partner let her rhetoric spell
Uh, she sweatin' metaphors, guess that's what I met her for
My shit deep, mainstream won't peep
So I just sweep the street and tell the sheep to go to sleep
I just freak the beat and move your sneakers when I speak
I just bring the heat, it melts your speakers when it leak
Rich in the mind, ignorance so costly
So I'm dealin' 'em, killin' em, not softly
Cause I'm only two decades with a knack
For these tracks, not a Gatt, so yeah, fuck that
Non-profit in your socket, pro bono prophet
Rockets in my pocket and I know you tryna' knock it
But this music got 'em hopin' and copin' and floatin'
Strokin' and gropin' and provokin' emotions
My shit is dope and, no jokin', you open
So power to the broken when the realness is spoken

Chorus:
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
You should tell somebody your story, before you give up all the glory
Yeah,yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
That's why I go and tell you now
Before you ever question how (question)

[Nitty Scott, MC]
Yo
I'm MC'd up, and D'd up, knee'd up
And it's about time that the game done re'ed up
My intellectual property, hip-hoperty, while niggas run monopoly stoppily
Take my strret cred' and set it and bet it
You could never do me, even if Simon said it
You could never keep your mind in while you're vibin' to my lines and
Mind your rhymes man, these are hard times when
I rap like I got somethin' to prove, cause I do
This is me, and my crew:
Nitty Scott; who are you?
This is duke, this is true; this is what I fuckin' do
Sick shots on the loop, this is fresh from the stu' (fresh)
Day in my kicks, shit you wouldn't be with
And you only call life a bitch cause she wouldn't let you hit it
Got me on a stand tryna get me to admit it
But killin' all these rappers the only crime that I committed
