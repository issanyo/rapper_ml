[Verse 1: Nitty Scott, MC]
It ain't hard to tell, you trying to keep the mozzarell'
While the whole damn game done gone to hell
I dominate you like a dominatrix
Hate my greatness cause you clearly ain't this
Send you on a permanent rap hiatus
Too much noise, gotta change your muffler
Super Nitty, I'm a full-time juggler
Juggernaut aiming for the jugular, yeah
Now don't be trying to say you got your hands on the wheel
Just because you got your little hands on a deal
What'd you have to do to get your brand on the seal?
Might look good, but you just not real
My flow raise eyebrows and the crime rate
Full time is my motherfucking mind state
Slim thang, but I got a big brain
Big enough to know that these rappers never eating off of my plate
I ain't show to your little cipher
Damn right, bitch, cause I'm way more nicer
Than all these little chicks on the hip-hop scene
Got 'em gassed up like they popped them beans
Probably think we got a whole lot in common
Rhyming for Gucci, rhyming for rhyming
Why? Cause we both got tits and a mic
And making words rhyme is a thing that you like?
Heard about your diss track, sorry that I missed that
I would never identify you with a diss back
Hop in the booth and the past goes missing
I passed class without the ass kissing
Play' em, spray 'em, slay 'em, man this shit is getting gory
I will tell my fucking story before I let you tell it for me
Bitch!

[Outro]
Hey, the name is Nitty Scott comma MC dot
Don't forget the mother fucking MC
Hey yo, I see you niggas out there fucking hating
Sending tweets and shit
Say that shit in my face
I'm tired of this bullshit
I've had some shit to say for a long time
I'm tired of being politically correct, you feel me?
Stop trying to fucking classify me
I'm a fucking human being, feel me?
I'm not a fucking femcee, I'm an artist
