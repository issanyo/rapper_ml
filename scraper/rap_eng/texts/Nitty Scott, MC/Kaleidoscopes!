[Intro]
Young Negrita could not sleep, because her thoughts were way too deep
Her mind had went out on a stroll and fallen down that rabbit hole
Mad hatters on adderal, guess the habit ain't bad at all huh
Guess the habit ain't bad at all
Is there heaven for the stainless?
Is there hades for the hainess?
I won't tell you but I say this
I got friends in both places on my playlist
Faces melting on the pavement
Eve and Adam in Oasis
Till she opened up the Matrix
If you think you ready for it, taste this
(Taste this)

[Chorus]
All this weed, all this weed that's alot of smoke
Off these drugs all I see is kaleidoscopes
All this weed, all this weed that's alot of smoke
Of these drugs all I see is kaleidoscopes
So don't' come for me and I won''t come for you
You, you, you
Fuck up the fun for me and then it's done for you
You, you, you

[Chorus Repeat]
All this weed, all this weed that's alot of smoke
Off these drugs all I see is kaleidoscopes
All this weed, all this weed that's alot of smoke
Of these drugs all I see is kaleidoscopes
So don't' come for me and I won''t come for you
You, you, you
Fuck up the fun for me and then it's done for you
You, you, you

[Verse 1]
All this weed, all this weed that's alot of smoke
Off these drugs all I see is
I'm on her, he on me that's alot of dope
Hunnid roles, pull it slow, then she drop it low
All of my bitches is gorgeous she wanna ride on my magical carpet
[?]
Benny lookin like a starlit
Her safari and i'm camoflougin
[?]

[Chorus Repeat]
All this weed, all this weed that's alot of smoke
Off these drugs all I see is kaleidoscopes
All this weed, all this weed that's alot of smoke
Of these drugs all I see is kaleidoscopes
So don't' come for me and I won''t come for you
You, you, you
Fuck up the fun for me and then it's done for you
You, you, you
