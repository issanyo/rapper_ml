[Verse 1]
You know I keep my eyes wide
Eastside fly guy
Flatbush tye-die
Purple label, bow tie
Shoot straight, cross eye
Gold gun, golden eye
See police slow the ride
I had a bitch with the flyest fabrics
I broke her heart
Used to call me Escobar
Skin fade, waves with the part
We dressed alike
But our mind was on different levels
I drove her crazy
Till the chain broke
Switching gears
Foot on the pedal, I'm going forward, fuck outta here
I blow a kiss and I got her
I never have to stare
Who using stairs?
This that escalator style
Spit hotlines
I charge a fee when you start to dial up
You niggas boo boo
Band aid when you got a cut
I gotta scar face forever feeling tuff
My heart pump bravado
Since Eddie Jones, Cedric ceballos
Before Kobe went to LA and was popping bottles
Forreal homie from the Twenty one two
I'm with the realist of real
So what the fuck you gonna do?
Before I leave 100 keepit to the Geez
Who come home with jail ID’S and state greens
Like what

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
I made some really poor decisions, a youngin lost, a system
That strongly forced division amongst us all was winning
Made a brother switch sports from basketball to pitching
Not baseball, just base, Tryna ball off of them hitting
Crack right in that glass pipe, I was on some mission
From hand to handing it all, to phone calls, commissions
Then one shot unclouded all my vision
My cousin gone, I miss him
They did him around my way
To this day feel like I'm paying the true cost of living
It’s my fault they hit em, I pray the lord is wit em
And when it rains it pours, Feds came storming in
And I escaped inditement but my boys all in prison
I was left with this pen in my hand, telling my damn story
Feeling it's a way to repent and get the past off me
So I scribble in this pad softly knowing there's a reason I got one more shot
Demand glory
