[Intro]
I can hear them talk
I can hear them whisper
Wonder why they're not feeling what I'm feeling
Never was a day that I tried to fit in
That's what makes me strong, that's what makes me different

[Pre-Hook]
Maybe it's something in the water
Maybe it's something I was sipping I'd be younger
Maybe something could be missing
Maybe I got it from my mother and my father

[Hook]
Tell your whole clique I'm different
Tell the whole system I'm different
Tell the whole world I'm lifting
On my own wave, I don't fit in
Tell your whole clique I'm different
Tell the whole system I'm different
Tell the whole world I'm lifting
On my own wave, I don't fit in

[Verse 1]
Hol' up, hol' up
Never wanted in on the in crowd
They try to count me out but I'm inbound (skrt)
Wanna keep in my lane, bitch how?
Watch I sold it out and I been crowned
I don't fear the reaper
Eat with freaks and unleash the Creature
Skip the press we ain't pressed to meet you
Like why your album ain't got no features
Hypebeasts I don't wanna sit with you
Shoot the shit and politic with you
Flip my bic and don't listen to what these ashy niggas wanna tell a bitch to do
Got some snowflakes and avalanches
Only know what you heard 'cause you a part of the herd
(Unclear) society flip the bird
Now we up in this motherfucker like Revenge of the Nerds

[Pre-Hook]
Maybe it's something in the water
Maybe it's something I was sipping I'd be younger
Maybe something could be missing
Maybe I got it from my mother and my father

[Hook]
Tell your whole clique I'm different
Tell the whole system I'm different
Tell the whole world I'm lifting
On my own wave, I don't fit in
Tell your whole clique I'm different
Tell the whole system I'm different
Tell the whole world I'm lifting
On my own wave, I don't fit in

[Verse 2]
Growing up I was too black for the Ricans not black enough for the blacks
Too ill for the 'burbs but I don't come from the trap
I was born in the midwest raised in the south
Took it to the jungle and I made it through the drought
I hit backwoods in every hood
They made me a box and I busted out
Mad that I never really fit the plan
And represent a combination they don't wanna understand
But fuck it I love niggas and I love girls too
No I ain't confused bitch I love girls too
The sexual intellectual
It's like I gotta sneak these niggas all their vegetables
Maybe it's just something I was swimming inside
Maybe I was born and never really alive
Maybe I descended from an alternate planet
And when I try to speak the truth I gotta tell 'em don't panic
I'm getting static

[Pre-Hook]
Maybe it's something in the water
Maybe it's something I was sipping I'd be younger
Maybe something could be missing
Maybe I got it from my mother and my father

[Hook]
Tell your whole clique I'm different
Tell the whole system I'm different
Tell the whole world I'm lifting
On my own wave, I don't fit in
Tell your whole clique I'm different
Tell the whole system I'm different
Tell the whole world I'm lifting
On my own wave, I don't fit in
