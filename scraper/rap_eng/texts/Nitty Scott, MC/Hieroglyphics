Man, I been in this
I hate when nigga try to put me on a bed with these brand new bitches
Man we don't know you
I been out rappin and trappin my ass off before it was so cool
You need to kill that
That percoset got me numb so you know that we never gon feel that
Nah, we don't feel that
My mind a weapon and I don't conceal that
Man, I'm a witness
I hate when niggas get to frontin in my phone like they livin on the lit, lit
Drop alittle name tryna make a little claim knowing he ain't never did this
All up in the mix, mix
Hit him with the "tsk, tsk"
Put him on a shitlist
Now he gettin dismissed
Yeah, he gettin dismissed
Yall don't wanna dis this
Man I'm suspicious
I hate when they reach and then try to compare me to Nicki
Maybe to Iggy, bitch is you dizzy?
My name be Nitty, got my own comittee: Chilluminati
I keep that tallisman all on my body
Evil eye, evil I pray em away
We giving fuck niggas all a bouquet
Man, I be livid
I hate when a nigga statin facts and you caught a nigga hatin
Fuck is you sayin? Fuck out the game if you scared of debating
Yall gettin nathan
I'm out the nation
Thought it was quiet you're sadly mistaken
I hit the spot and then collect compensation
If you play games then I collect compensation
I sold a verse to ya nigga, he said he needed that work
He want it straight from the dealer, I had him goin bezerk
