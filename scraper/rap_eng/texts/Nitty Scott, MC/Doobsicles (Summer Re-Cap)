Yo Jelani, turn that up
Oh, how was my first summer in the game?
*laughs* Man, I don't even know how to describe it. Like..
Just too much goin' on
Lotta, Lotta new faces, lotta new places
Let me, you know what, matter fact, I'mma just tell 'em like this
Let's get into it
Check it

Summer breezin', chiefin' on this leaf an'
Easin' on the beat reflectin' on my sunny season
See I just wanted to be heard up in my region
So I dropped The Chronicles and gave them all a reason
Pocket distribution for the EP next
They couldn't find release dates with GPS
I ain't mad, but to the fans: my bad
I promise that it's comin' and we launchin' off the pad
The Source Mag call me unsigned hype
Now everybody wanna type about my unsigned life
I heard my voice on the radio for the first time
That shit reminded me of when I wrote my first rhyme
And my brother brought a kid into the world
She was like 6 pounds and 1 ounce; a babygirl
Wish I was there to say peace to my niece
But I was in VA doin' a meet and greet
Either way, man, the streets been sweet
They knock me off my feet when they repeat my speech
Like shout out to the guy who showed me 5 hooks
Waited in line just so I could sign his rhyme book
Many flicks, many picks, many plugs, many daps, many raps, many hugs
See I felt like star when I opened up for Kendrick Lamar
I was a fan since KDot, not all of you are
And who would figure, that I'd be in the back with Rob Digger(?)
Discussin' bigger figures, comin' up quicker
I'm progressin' and expressin' with blessin's in my possession
Just an underdog in the presence of these legends
And I don't want to talk about the pressure
Let's just say the stresses is pushin' me to be better
Let's just say they wanna get cheddar with go getters
I came up then they change up like the weather
And oh! There was a murder; the victim was a rapper
Send the competition to me lyrically clapper
My life is like a movie and we in a better chapter
Flip the script on 'em, got the action for these actors
See I'm just chasin' a frame, with my name in the hip hop Hall of Fame
Went from unknown to the name on flames
Not bad for my very first summer in the game
