(Hook: Troy Ave)

Sippin' champagne for the pains I drown with
Pardoning these lames
It’s insane how they mind different
Fuck up out my lane, we no same, nigga I’m different
Simple mathematics, take away all the bullshit
Man you got me in the spot
I am free, you is not
Kept it G from the jump
I’m just waiting for my shot
Fuck waiting, take shots at whoever on the top
Make room, or make yo way up out my spot, aha ha ha ha

(Verse: Troy Ave)

I see two nipples pierced on a king-sized bed
Move to my right palm trees and blue water all ahead
Short flight, somebody daughter about to give me head
But she ain’t nobody mama, no baby for the drama
Every day I got a llama, or a 80, or a pound
Better safe than sorry in the parts I be around
The wolves in the full them sheeps skin
But I am known to pack 2 and I be beasting
I do it with straps, I do it with raps
It’s me in the club nigga, I do it with racks
Sipping on bub, flipping and hustling facts
Bitches in love, I love to fuck with em back
When I was a teenager I was about my paycheck
Advances from genesis, I ain't talking bout Sega
Now I’m in my 20’s and out here doing it major
Without a deal least until they get that pay up

(Hook: Troy Ave)

Sippin' champagne for the pains I drown with
Pardoning these lames
It’s insane how they mind different
Fuck up out my lane, we no same, nigga I’m different
Simple mathematics, take away all the bullshit
Man you got me in the spot
I am free, you is not
Kept it G from the jump
I’m just waiting for my shot
Fuck waiting, take shots at whoever on the top
Make room, or make yo way up out my spot, aha ha ha ha


(Verse: Nitty Scott)

Now I don’t usually share my weaknesses for others to use
Taught to never give 'em rumors, ammunition the news
But this particular winter, see I was hurting for dinner
Running low on my figures and so I called on my nigga
He played me like a cold ho-ass gold-digger
And put my broke ass on blast like, "go figure"
Had me feeling like Sam Cook in downtown
I was turning to my brother but he knocked me down
No fast forward to the present tense and all these press events
You try to get up in my house like you a resident
It’s evident, you never thought that I’d be relevant
Now you wanna represent
It’s Nitty Scott for president
You fair-weather nigga, enemies is better nigga
At least they honest in the room when we together nigga
Now these go-getters claiming we close
I throw them bitches in the water, wait to see who floats
You a phony and I get that that
You wanna dap me but you trashing if I don’t dap back
I get it, I really get it, man I spit it with the lights on
Mics on, now who’s sleeping with the python?

(Hook: Troy Ave)

Sippin' champagne for the pains I drown with
Pardoning these lames
It’s insane how they mind different
Fuck up out my lane, we no same, nigga I’m different
Simple mathematics, take away all the bullshit
Man you got me in the spot
I am free, you is not
Kept it G from the jump
I’m just waiting for my shot
Fuck waiting, take shots at whoever on the top
Make room, or make yo way up out my spot, aha ha ha ha

(Verse: CJ Fly)

Sinister with a sin of steel (?)
Buckle up, how I look When I sit and stare?
Learned about stocks, for my business I didn't share
Not the same but just a nigga that
Used to be a slinger yea
Sit in stairs like the ugly girl from high school
And split piff for years
Knew a department, not the clothes, it was dope
Get in says, and did so many racks, they made arrangements
Check, you with the guap, know what the payment (?)
Making it levitate alleviates the situation
A rock in a hard place and the walls about to cave in
No BM with the diphase, safe and you look out for em
They go missing in offense, get taken
Take care of the fake friends
