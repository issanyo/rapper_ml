[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Just copped a crispy new white tee
Classic white Nikes, not spilling my icey
Don't wait on lines, but still might see me at the bar trying to pipe tonight's wifey
I left something mean at the valet
Yea... My baby look clean on them ballets
You know how I move out the goons out
Go up in a fool mouth, throw you off of a new couch
Aye Ben ditto
Nooooo
Yea, Puerto Rico
Hooooo
Don't fish for trouble bacalaito
Cause I'll go nuts and crack you like a Nemo

[Chorus]
Coast to coast New York to Chicago
Everbody drinking the trago
Raise your hands, pop your bottles
The afterparty last till tomorrow

We gonna party hasta manana
Esta fiesta nunca se acaba
East L.A., Spanish Harlem
The afterparty last till tomorrow

[Verse 2: Bodega Bamz]
Please believe me I'm papi
Please believe me I'm papi
I got a stack in my pocket
Cartier just to watch it
Gotta kiss myself cause I'm poppin
I was chilling with a Chula named candy
So good I could bring her to The Grammys
From uptown, keep it G, still fancy
Tiger print, take a flick in YA panties
Bring the Hennessy
Beverly, she's my everything
Fever like the seventies
Melanie got the melody and remedy
She bad, so bad, that's it’s good energy
Mami si, ven aqui
Hop, skip, and jump
She get in the truck
I got a dirty Diana diamond princess cuts
She nipped and tuck
Put a little fat in her butt
She came to me on E
So I'll gas you up
Purple kisses mack you up
Bag you up
No loose change
But I'm up so I'm down to uhh
So high Mary Jane
Never pass you up
That drug talk
You kno I gotta crack you up

[Chorus]
Coast to coast New York to Chicago
Everbody drinking the trago
Raise your hands, pop your bottles
The afterparty last till tomorrow

[Verse 3: Nitty Scott]
Mood on too brand new
Baby hair, flares, lip gloss and bamboos
Baby girl stay on heads like shampoo
And I got that Mangu for you and ya mans too
Block hot, drop top, so I gotta chill 'em
Shit too lit, sunglasses & advil 'em
AYE! If my papi leave me Imma kill 'em
And I only want drinks with little umbrellas in 'em
Mi gusta esa sabor
Smoke like cohiba, conquistator
Bailar bonita, she hit the floor
And say
Why ju gotta hate the BORICUA FOR?

[Chorus]
Coast to coast New York to Chicago
Everbody drinking the trago
Raise your hands, pop your bottles
The afterparty last till tomorrow
