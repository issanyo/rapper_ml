Me I was putting bass on a track son
I had a ?, smack you in your face when it slap sumtin'
Ask son if it shine like the black son
Didn't think sort of ink could flood the map son
So heavy that the levees had to crack son
And make you crap son, for making crap son
Don't cry son, there's no pride son
You getting stung like dad whipping that ass
For that last report card you had, you barely passed son
Pass son the math, we getting cash, Boyz II Men!

So what you thought kid?
You was the boss kid?
You manage Ross kid

Off kids' heads coming off the top kid
We coming off the block with the Glocks kid
They gon' pop so they don't get popped kid
Then pop shit and turn it to a mystery, pop quiz
Popped Jizz now it is what it is kid
Tom Hanks, Chris Wallace, big kid
I'm like the Juice Crew

Rakim before the ? , Wiz Kids
Peabody at the party
Piss kids off, when I spit kid, talk to the dick kid
Kids lost, run around with the shark
Drowned in the ground, and got found in the park
Tossed in the ditch, for walking with the 5th
He stalkin' after darted your heart
Can I live? kid
It's back to this kid
We pack the clips kid
Boyz II Men kid
