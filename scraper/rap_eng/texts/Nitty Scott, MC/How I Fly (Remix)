This is how I fly
Ha

Bubonic'd up, sauerkraut. (sssh!)
You know what'll light the way when the power's out
You know? Mary Jane, Oh Mary Jane (oh)
Need to change her hair color, got a brand new name (see ya!)
I love it when you gain them pounds (love it)
Cause my attitude sucks when you ain't came 'round. (uh)
They can judge, but they don't blow (uh-uh)
But "It's Something About Mary" that they don't know (they don't know)
Got me open like Ben Stiller! (oh)
Lookin' for my lighter cause my friend got killer (uhh)
Handin' him a Dutch, roll a ten my nilla, (fo' real)
Know what I’d do with all of my scrilla

This is how I flyyy

Tryna get loose so I light the light
Tryna get right so light the lighter
I'mma be cool once I’ll finally fly
It's alright once you light that fire
This is how I fly

Tryna get loose so I light the light
Tryna get right so light the lighter
And I'mma be cool once I’ll finally fly
It's alright once you light that fire
This is how I fly

[Currensy]
OG cush in a glass jar
Inspired of rhymes, they buy the fast cars
No rap star, not by far dawg
You tryna have my smoke and keep my lights on
So when them hoes walk through their mind
My closet full of kids, putting my crew mix on
Taking pictures of my shit, wearing my chain
Weeded out their brains, High Hefner
Backseat of the ’99 Continental T
Giving my driver directions
Living like I’ve been here before
Some bitches, they trim it for my partners they grow

Now you’re high, clubbed I the sky
Better court or fighting marshal when my team walked by
Cause Styles brought a package from the hood pharmacologist
Doctor break the bedroom down, roll me up a document
And it ain’t nothing, we just rolling stoned
Getting fly up and slide up in the family stone
Puff to my pillow, getting serious head
I just wake up and I bake up, call it breakfast in bed
Hey, you already know that my kush cologne
It’s a little too strong for you to be putting on
I’ll show you how to make a whole ounce disappear
We sold out, you probably hear it in your head
You rather stunt in the club, I rather chi funk’d up
Catch some munchies and I hit the bodega for brog
So twist that shit, light that shit, smoke
These backwards got me so it’s blunts I'mma tow, wathup?
