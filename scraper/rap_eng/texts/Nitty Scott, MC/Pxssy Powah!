[Verse 1]
Man, I been elevated since I made it here
So much shade in here I'm faded, drunk off hater tears
Thought I made it clear I be that it-girl of the sky
Prada goddess, keep mascara on my seeing eye, eye
Now what's a place like me doing in a girl like this
Gonna rock to the revolution in my hips
I be glowed up wit a gold wrist
Drop it on your tongue and have a happy trip
I'm on a kushy diet
[?] ski mask like a pussy riot
Pop papayas no time for tyrants
Say fuck the power 'cause we been defiant

[Chorus]
Pussy Power [Repeated]

[Verse 2]
Afro-Latino, branded Taino
Any Latino, like vente conmigo
Lima, Havana and Rio
You loving the Coco, loquio
La negra tiene tumbao
La negra tiene tumbao-bao
La negra tiene tumbao
La negra tiene tumbao-bao
Look at the mix, babies on hips
Rollas and all of my cholas with clips
Ese candela, boricua, morena
They up in favellas all under the eclipse
I want all my chilluminati mamis around the world to rub on your titties if you don't give a fuck!

[Chorus]
Pussy Power [Repeated]
