(Creature!)

[Chorus x2]
Little honeysuckle be the reina of the jungle
Mira mi tranquila vida riding down the Congo
Got that El Dorado and my mama do the mambo
I'm so aficionado when I'm banging on my bongo

[Verse 1]
Rolled up clean in the whip
Fly girl lean on, seen in a bit
Team full of queens, lil' gleam on the wrist
Feed up her jeans, shawty mean in the hips
She's seeing if it's lit
Let her beam, let her twist
Whine to remind and she twerk to resist
Working it and worship the earth in her dip
Stolen from Africa seeking a gift
Sixteen on a ship

[Bridge]
Dreaming to the beat of the drum all day
One with the sun let it lead my way
La hija de la diaspora
Dreaming to the beat of the drum all day
One with the sun, let it lead my way
La hija de la diaspora , yeah
Sing!

[Breakdown]

[Chorus x2]
Little honeysuckle be the reigner of the jungle
Mira mi tequila vida riding down the congo
Got that El Dorado and my mama do the mambo
I'm so aficionado when I'm banging on my bongo

[Verse 2]
Freed all my people, from here to Montego
Dale morena, like this Puerto Rico
We go, when we make it rain like El Nino
Got that sofrito, that primo, that negro
None of the hitters is fucking with me though
We so cool, we ride off in El Camino
We gon' be seen, yo, no need no Nat Geo
Got so much juice, they just call me Tampico

[Bridge]
Dreaming to the beat of the drum all day
One with the sun let it lead my way
La hija de la diaspora
Dreaming to the beat of the drum all day
One with the sun, let it lead my way
La hija de la diaspora, yeah
Sing!

[Verse 3]
Bam, bam, dreaming to the beat of the faded drum
Sung, sung from the tongue of the native one
Bam, bam, dreaming to the beat of the faded drum
Sung, sung from the tongue of the native one
The spirit is alive
Light another fire, if you fuckin with the tribe, vibes
I said the spirit is alive
Light another fire, if you fuckin with the tribe

[Outro]
This is the story of the diaspora
Her tribute to the daughters of a marooned society
Yo soy negra y latina
