[Hook: Nitty Scott, MC]
And maybe I could be your little Buddha Baby
Flyer than a butterfly can I be your lady
Lately you've been on my mind when I'm wavy
Take your time on it baby til its mine

[Verse 1: Shiquon]
I remember when I first laid my eyes on you
Rest assure I was feeling you at the time
I love it when you speak deep composition from out your mind
And it's fine man I love it when women can bust a rhyme
Might be the leader of the school if they give you the props
Go for days keep it going til the end and show you won't stop
Never let them keep you from elevating up to the top
Oh lawd flower child had bloomed beautifully from her pot
If it rains I'll be the shade if there's pain I'll be the healer
Keep my thoughts a secret one day I think I'll reveal the
Clues behind the context if this here was a contest
I'll win your heart in seconds when we determine who rhymes best
But I bet we would both debate over it then we'll find
Compromise and would agree there no winner but yet a tie
This crush on you was real when I pop the top man oh my
If the age isn't a problem I hope one day you'll be mine

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shiquon]
I can day dream for days but my fantasies
Will never equal up to it happening in reality
I open up my eyes to this scripted world that we living in
And wonder if tonight will I see you there in my dreams again
Can't get my hopes I let it digress
Speaking how I feel isn't easy getting off my chest
I'm sailing on ship thinking where you are like a pirate
I hope it wouldn't break and resist the heat like a Pyrex
I can do the typical roses and violets tip
But I thought I'd be creative within the topic and flip
Nearly most of what I'm feeling and rap them to you from me and more
Won't take it overboard or be extra and call you mi amor
Hard working girl dedicated to what you passion
Passionate about your craft hoping I can show it compassion
Actions speak way more than terminology use to define it
But I just picked apart each letter just to describe it

[Hook]

[Bridge: Shiquon & Nitty Scott, MC]
They say you only have one chance one opportunity
To show and tell that person so it's clear to see
That you're the one for them so they'll know that you never will let them down
But pick them up and maintain tranquility
They say you only have one chance one opportunity
To show and tell that person so it's clear to see
That you're the one for them so they'll know that you never will let them down
But pick them up and maintain tranquility now are you feeling me

[Hook]

[Hook 2: Shiquon]
And maybe you could be my little Buddha Baby
Flyer than a butterfly will you be your lady
Lately you've been on my mind when I'm wavy
Take my time on it baby til its mine
