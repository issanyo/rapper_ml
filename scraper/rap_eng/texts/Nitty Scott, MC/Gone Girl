[Intro]
Uh
Just let it ride, let it ride
This shit
It sound like pain
I can relate

[Verse 1]
Yo
Maybe it's the drugs
I'm giving you nigga shrugs
I'm unplugged, disconnected and bugged out
I'm all hugged out
And all I got is bars
All I got is scars
But they just want to light cigars over slow guitar
And watch me do the pole dance underneath the stars
Hold up
I'll take it back to learning to tie my laces
Familiar faces ran races in intimate places
And maybe one of those intimate paces
That move at fast paces and seek better spaces
I was divorced in the family portrait, I know my limits
Step daddy trying get up in it, I ain't with it
So I did it, bought a ticket and split it
[?]
Coach class, leave my pass on a one way
Had to take my life into my own hands some way
Hoping I can rise above it one day
It wasn't easy like Sunday

[Chorus x2]
What you know about pain?
The kind that leaves stains on your veins
I'll tell you why the cage bird sings
Think I'm going insane

[Verse 2]
Okay
I stayed in school, tried to remain in a booth
Cause it was just me
Four walls and the truth
Put my dreams on hold for survival mode
Cause the nights were long and the wind was cold
Vultures of our culture praying on my young ambitions
Telling me schemes (Uh)
Selling me dreams (Uh)
Push to the extremes 'till the hell of me screams
I'm lost in mans [?] nothing's what it seems
Nightly at the spot but I'm from your block (Uh)
Light as a rock and I'm locked if you knock
I'm patient but I'm anxious
See they're not the same thing
I just catch an overdose of adrenaline to my brain
Cold sweats, nausea, dizziness, chest pains
Automatic panic, frenetic in the fast lane
This shit is odd and I'm looking to god for a nod
I need a sign not another facade
But while I'm waiting and contemplating
I keep the weed burning
Keep the page turning
Like a long sermon
Got a curse for nervousness that's hitting the surface
Guess that all I'm trying to say is that I'm flawed but I'm working

[Chorus x2]
