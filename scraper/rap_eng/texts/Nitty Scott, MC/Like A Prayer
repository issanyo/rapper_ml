(I'm the J57)

[Verse 1: Nitty Scott, MC]
Hey God, it's me again
I'm just checking in in here, confessing all my sins
See I've been questioning organized religionin
Trying to tame the fire that be burning up within
I feel the need to know
Rightful and insightful
Many a disciple, idols in their bibles
Should I hit the synagogue, temple, or the steeple
Searching for the answer I think about my people
They travel passages leading them to the Africas
Threw the shackles on them and benefited per capita
Disease damage, villages and ravages
Call them savages and abolish native practices
I'm not here to say what is and what ain't
But if you coming in peace then why you forcing the faith
Daaamn
I'm just working through the schemes and scams
Trying to figure out who I am

[Hook(with scratches):]
Hail Mary
Full of grace
Do you believe in God?
Enter my religion you'll be more like God
Hail Mary
Full of grace
Enter my religion you'll be more like God

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott, MC]
My daddy loved Jehova, My momma loved Jesus
Granny talk to the Virgin Mary when she sleepless
My brother on some other shit he says he know the truth
And everybody wanna preach a gospel to the youth
I heard of witches and black magic
Mix a little Scientology and we back at it, like crack addicts
The things we do for our beliefs dawg
Radical supporters wanna meet God for the Jihad
It seems to me that we separate ourselves
Our very own downfall, create our own hell
Man made, man broke, and man used
And we see a lot of judgment in our (?)
Illuminati, illumination, enlightenment
They'll rather have us living in fear than our entitlement
Ignorance is bliss? Me, I call it prison
Lord help me make the right decision

[Hook(with scratches):]
Hail Mary
Full of grace
Do you believe in God?
Enter my religion you'll be more like God
Hail Mary
Full of grace
Enter my religion you'll be more like God
