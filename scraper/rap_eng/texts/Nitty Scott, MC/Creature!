[Intro]

[Chorus]
Get up, come closer
I got that magic, that potion
I got the stars in my hands, baby I can tell that you open
I'm in control right now, you're in a creature's realm
This is my universe, so you should just bow down
(Creature!)

[Post-Chorus]
Creature (repeated)

Creature, got the creap on tap
Lil bad bad  black with her freak on wax
And it's bad bad when I make the clizzap clap
And if I put in on you know I gotta get it back
Hi I come from the the supernova
Leveosa, no levosa
They don't wanna rumble with the brew-hard
She a hood witch bitch like ha-ha-ha-ha
And he like, nigga she might bite
Put the genie in the bottle, keep the lid on tight
But I'm free to the night, free to the night
And it's little to these bitches that I be unlike
Drip, drip, you can't trip with us
Just put the melon into your lips and bust
I'mma have these niggas screaming like hola-eh
From the peace coast to the californi-yay

Get up, come closer
I got that magic, that potion
I got the stars in my hands, baby I can tell that you open
I'm in control right now, you're in a creature's realm
This is my universe, so you should just bow down
(Creature!)

[Chorus]
Creature (repeated)

Now wouldn't you like to know what's in my cauldron? (Rad Bitches sink up)
Never get vexed, throw hex and do it often (Rad Bitches sink up)
Pretty little freak of nature in my garden  (Rad Bitches sink up)
[?] (Rad Bitches sink up)
