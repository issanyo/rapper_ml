(Creature)

[Chorus]
I don't wanna write this down
Wanna tell you how I feel
I don't wanna cry right now, gotta tell you how I feel

[Verse 1]
I just been so solitary, I can't lift off the ground
Deeper, deeper getting scary but  I'd just rather drown
Feel like ending this pretending
A queen without a crown
What's the purpose, she's just searching for love she never found

[Chorus]
I don't wanna write this down
Wanna tell you how I feel
I don't wanna cry right now, gotta tell you how I feel

[Verse 2]
[?]

[Chorus]
I don't wanna write this down
Wanna tell you how I feel
I don't wanna cry right now, gotta tell you how I feel
