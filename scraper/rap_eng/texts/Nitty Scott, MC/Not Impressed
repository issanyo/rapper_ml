You want attention
Want my eyes on you
Wanna be mentioned
Standing in my spotlight

Fading from a love but I
I don't question the eyes

I don't need desperate Guys

You're stepping on my line

You can move now!
I'm not Impressed
Yeah, You're working hard
But you need to stop right there
I'm not Impressed
I can feel you want
What I got
But I don't Care

You're in danger
Are we no stranger

You're in danger

Are we no stranger
You're in danger

Are we no stranger
You're in danger

Are we no stranger
You're a Liar

I'mma keep it to myself
But your time's up
Whisper something else in somebody else's ear

Cuz I, I don't question the eyes
I don't need desperate guys
You're Stepping on my line
You can move now!
I'm not Impressed
Yeah, You're working hard
But you need to stop right there
I'm not Impressed
I can feel you want
What I got
But I don't Care
You're in danger
Are we no stranger
You're in danger
Are we no stranger
You're in danger
Are we no stranger
You're in danger
Are we no stranger
You're going incognito
I'mma cancel you like nino
Stay sippin' in my energy
Just to elevate your ego
My disposition don't fleet though
Sweet baby Jesus on a manger
I know this man ain't bout to trade his cellphone for no paycheck
I made ya
And I don't need your pizza
Stay high and give me your lovin'
Stay fly and don't give me your fingers
Got the flavor that you still can taste later
Oh!
I shut him down
Just to make it clear
Are when I'm done you gon remember
San Jose was Here
I'm not Impressed
Yeah, You're working hard. Hard. hard
I'm not Impressed
I can feel you want
What I got
But I don't Care
You're in danger
Are we no stranger
You're in danger

Are we no stranger
You're in danger
Are we no stranger
