[Verse 1: Rocky Rivera]
Uh, seems like yesterday we were both chasing a ice cream truck
I was so in a rush to grow up
Dancing in my momma's pumps, singing the Janet Jackson songs
With my imaginary fans in the front
So what if they was a couple of teddy bears and my mic was a brush
Yo I'm still the same girl that was riding the bus
Rapping along to the song straight verse to the hook
There’s only one Lauryn Hill in my book, and I respect that
Every time I fell in love we had a setback
First time I hit the stage I never went back
I was that little girl in the cypher
Wishes I can rhyme with them, knowing I'm a better writer but
Imma, let them lyrically compare their dick size
And by the way that they rap, it was like this size
So I made my own cypher over here
Like I don't give a fuck with these boys over here
So I never had to fuck with these boys over here
They love my style love to whisper in my ear
But I'm gone like the wind cause I got a career
Im married to the hustle yo, fuck what you hear

[Hook: Rocky Rivera]
And I daydream about it, like I wish this world were mine
So I say it in the rhyme, I say it in the rhyme, and I
Love it too much just to ever stop
Cause what I'm talking bout yall is hip-hop

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott, MC]
Uh huh, yeah
Hey hi, how you doing
I took the time to write this letter to you and
I just hope you can appreciate my honesty
Cause honestly, I constantly just want you to acknowledge me
I was, blowing bubbles in the sandbox
That's when I fell in love with your jam box
Sometimes I would repeat the things you said in the house
Then my mom's is rubbing soap in my mouth
But anyways, the punishment just wasn’t enough
I would blush, cause see I had the ultimate crush
And without you ever knowing who I are
I quietly admired from afar
Like how I know you got a thing for DJ's
Tape decks and pressing that replay
You prefer talks on the beat, over walks on the beach
Feat be, buoying up concrete streets
But then it hurt when they discovered your worth
The rings and the bling and the things you could birth
It always seem to me they slutted you out,uh
Hit you like a cigarette and butted you out
You weren't mine so I said it in the rhyme
I’ve been hear loving you this whole time
Baby I'm
Patiently waiting in my city
For you to write back, sincerely love Nitty

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rocky Rivera]
I use to love him, when I heard him on the speakers
Or underneath the bleachers when I hid em from my teachers
He was the only real thing I ever knew
But he, wanted fame so he played me like a fool
I cried like any other woman would do
Brushed myself off ye fuck you too
I got dreams I can do much better than you
What kind of chick would let that bullshit slip
I rather, do my thing like a journalist do
Momma was a rolling stone till I moved the fuck home
And I, had to watch you from a distance
You wanted me back and I admire your persistence
Still wishing, we could of been the best you and me
But your insecurity made you suffer musically
In order to grow, I had to go
But I will always have your back, and I'm hear to let you know

[Hook]
