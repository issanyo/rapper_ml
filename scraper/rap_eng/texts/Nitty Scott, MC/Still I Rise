[Intro]
I'm fallin', ah, ah
I'm fallin'
I'm fallin', ah, ah
I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'

[Verse 1]
Uh, memories of Langston on my lips
When I was convinced that river asked me for a kiss
Couldn't unblock my life
Couldn't unlock my bliss
And who are they to say I'm not allowed to call it quits
I don't know why I romanticise
And fantasize crossing to the other side
I guess the world I've had enough of it
Got that young blood and they just want a cup of it
Couldn't stop for Death so he kindly stopped for me
The carriage held with just ourselves and immortality
That was Emily but I feel like I wrote it
So I quote it, just a poet
Writing my chapter to close it

[Chorus]
And still, I rise
I rise (x2)
'Cause you can write me down in history and seal it with the lies
Like the sun and the tide I will rise
And still I rise (x2) (i rise x2)
There's no need to disguise
You can see it in my eyes
Like the dust I will rise
I rise (x2)

[Bridge]
Momma I just wanna talk to you
I know it's been a long time but
But I got this on my heart
Just listen, uh

[Verse 2]
Memories of what he did to me
Stolen innocence, he was akin to me
I had to leave, you found it hard to believe
Because he was the husband that you wanted to please
But you should have protected me
And, mommy, when you didn't, you neglected me
Now I ain't even got respect for me
Sleeping with a bad man when you should have been next to me
I don't really know what happened to us
And I'm hoping maybe one day we can get back in touch
Until then, I keep you in my prayers and such
And for the record, man, I miss you so much

(still I rise)

[Chorus]
And still, I rise
I rise (x2)
'Cause you can write me down in history and seal it with the lies
Like the sun and the tide I will rise
And still I rise (x2) (i rise x2)
There's no need to disguise
You can see it in my eyes
Like the dust I will rise
I rise (x2)

[Bridge]
I can feel my heart healing
Feel my heart healing (x3)
I can feel it
(x2)

[Chorus]
And still, I rise
I rise (x2)
'Cause you can write me down in history and seal it with the lies
Like the sun and the tide, I will rise
And still I rise (x2) (i rise x2)
There's no need to disguise
You can see it in my eyes
Like the dust I will rise
I rise (x2)
