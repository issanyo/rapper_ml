[Verse 1: Nitty Scott]
I plan damage
The baddest and I been a savage
Self managed
Pussy niggas wanna take advantage
I'm half Spanish
And flip it like an acrobatic
I'm half Spanish
Adobo in the fuckin' attic
He on a duty, wanna make that tongue touch
Following the booty 'cause it taste like rum punch
Tough luck, I could see these niggas is dumbstruck
Leave the toto untouched, give 'em a thumbs up
Ha! You know the footage is uncut
Looking at the glo like how they do that Bori?
Little Mamasita with the hair all sporty
Pull the forty out my titties, how you do that shorty?
Quicker than a lick & all the snickers is thick
Had that boy like, "I just wanna put in the tip."
Let my hair down, showed him it was longer than dick
I know this shit lit, got more body there than your bitch
SWITCH!
Fuck it, I'ma take her too
It's her birthday, we could celebrate her too
In the worst way, I'ma motivate her through
And if she roll her own blunt, I'ma make her boo
Got a Black daddy and my mama Puerto Rican
That's cornbread and empanadas on the weekend
You know that, and I throw back
Got the Cognac poppin, where the hoes at?

[Chorus]
Boricua
I hear them singing my song
Morena
They do it all night long
Boricua
I hear them singing my song
Morena
They do it all night long
Boricua
I hear them singing my song
Morena
They do it all night long
Boricua
I hear them singing my song
Morena
They do it all night long

[Verse 2: Bodega Bamz]
Upside, insideout
You wanna live this vida loca
Leave the drink on the coaster
Come take a ride in the roaster
That's how I approached her
Made you look with the surprise face
I made wish now gimme that surprise cake
I'm inpatient but shit I could buy wait
Body done
No wonder you walking by fake
Like nigga please I know ya type
Drink smoke rolling dice
You fine, I could maybe wife
You lying, I'm bugging
Didn't even ask ya name
Over here bragging you call it running game
Where ya man? Never mind if you got
I like all my ice, Never mind if I'm hot
Take another shot to the face
Maybe right
I'm saying
Taste baby Taste
Mine or yours? I let you chose which place
Gone in 60, another minute Iâ€™ma break
But who cares what I might could do
I might say 3 times some more
A sweat I might for you
I like you boo
I know I said 3 times before
Never front, roll a blunt
Hit the back door
They call me Bodega and I can show you what's in store

[Chorus]
Boricua
I hear them singing my song
Morena
They do it all night long
Boricua
I hear them singing my song
Morena
They do it all night long
Boricua
I hear them singing my song

Boricua
I hear them singing my song
Morena

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
The flyest bitch just cool to me
They fronting like costume jewelry
I can fuck whoever I want
Whenever I feel
However they want it my sex game for real
Let me guess .. she got a man damn? ruined ya plans fam?
Same bitch was in my room doing handstands
Pebbles in my watch make her look at me like Bam Bam
I 8 got ya whip looking like a trans am
What can I say they be on the papi
First I lift up the Cavs like Lebron and Kryie
Maybe I'll lick they ass no pause I'm Nasty ..
No panty, no panty, noooooo!!

[Chorus]
