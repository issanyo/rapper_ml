[Verse 1: Nitty Scott]
Yo, I can see it in your eyes, think you just got two
Fascinated with the new flu, two by two
All my zoo shit true and I'm too badu
I be all over their head like the shampoo do
Snoozing on a revolution so I blew by you
Literally leave your body in the Blue Bayou
We be looking at your troopers and your crew like ''who?''
Educating, elevating on your boo IQ
Pledge allegiance to nothing, I got the wood and he crushing
My kamikazes are coming to light Picasso percussion, you dummy
Little bummy ain't a damn thing funny
You so poor, honey, all you have is money

[Hook: Nitty Scott]
So inhale the fragrance
I be the apex, ho, get on my wavelength
Another like me? Highly unlikely
Hiding in my psyche, I dare you to come and find me

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I dare you to come and dare me to flip and commit a homi
I promise to God I'm probably the God of rhyming
Dividing the profits with prophets, prophecy wasn't lying
I grew my hair out just so I could look like a lion
So when I say I wore it, that metaphor is more exciting
I understand that, for sure like beach homes and sand crabs
Bonjour, bitch pardon my French
I never been to France, but I like to kiss like them
Consider this the Kiss of Death like Jada came through
Nitty, you know it's love when they showing hate, boo
Food for thought, hope you get a plateful
Lately I done turned the booth to a dinner table
Young mindfuck, what the fuck you thought?
Fire in my eyes, in my shades it's dark
And I'm still getting used to this famous part
They say I sold my soul, but what about what I bought?
Soul
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nitty Scott]
It's rap game, little Bhudda baby
I take it you can hang in spaces with mother nature the Bhudda lady
You feel my nexus, I'm flexin' my solar plexus
We can have a flower orgy and keep it all in an essence
More dread from warheads
They want the poor dead, but I fed the universe on my forehead
And did this happen beforehand?
Now face it, they just basically erasing them glitches up in the matrix
Always thought the term Black Magic was kinda racist
And I have yet to find intelligent basis for all the hatred
Attracting and deflecting a core of my star portals
Ain't it gorgeous to be mortal? I couldn't be more cordial
Now who dare stare into the hazy sun?
I tell 'em it was I, Nitty Scott the wavy one
I move things that move things with mood swings
Got these niggas kissing my mood ring, I'm out

[Hook]
