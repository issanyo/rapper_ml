[Intro]
NO PANTY!

[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz]
Pull up to the spot
Get lit then I
Shorty show me love
1 night hitter
P-A-P-I
What that spell?
PAPI! PAPI! Make me yell
Ima pimp (what!)
And I’m proud of it
They call me young don baby, let me teach you how to dance
You already got the look, let me teach you how to glance
Let me show you how to move with the uh with the uh
No love for the girls on the side of shit
I wanna hit always talking undecided shit
I really mind the shit
It’s either mine or his
FaceTime from Milan real designer shit
Flip a coin, take a chance
What you wanna do?
I’m warning you
I’m wanting you
And that’s real baby
Lose me
What you think you gonna win?
Get ya bags shut the door bitch come on in

[Chorus]
No Panty!

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
Hella faded, shakin' it, mamis is getting naked
Little sip drip on your lips, baby don’t waste it
We don’t hit the bar, just send for more cases
Take pics, I won’t remember though, I’m wasted
Oye! Papi! Just
Get this rapido!
Pretty Ricky, love me like i’m Lucy
Let me pop coochie in my dubi dubi
1am, we was boarding the yacht
2am, we was all in the SPOT
3am, shorty making it hot
I told lift her little skirt & she was droppin a squat, like
Que bonita bandera
You know we get it wetter
Take it off, it’s whatever
No Panty, No Panty today

[Chorus]
No Panty!

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]

Baddies off the wall like a Mike releasing
Cups in the air like Christ is drinking
I’ll spin u around, God Bless the G string
Give it to me mommy
This eve mommy
Mañana I don’t know where I’m a be mommy
I leave mommy, overseas mommy, I’m a G mommy
My jeans prolly cough up another G mommy
I’m in here with a brand new outfit
Kicks never dirty cause I stand on couches
Everybody good all my mans the bouncers
You smoke? Backwoods full of grams and ounces
Whole night paid for I do it major
Let me give ya body everything it came for
You ca stay however long you wanna stay for
Afterparty in my suite on the 8th floor

[Chorus]
No Panty!
