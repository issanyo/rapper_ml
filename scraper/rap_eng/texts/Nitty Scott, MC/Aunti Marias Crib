[Verse 1]
Chilling in the green room looking for a plug
Shutterbug puffing on a gateway drug
Got a hug habit and we live from the planet
Run and tell Zagat when you put it on your palate
Yum yum sugarplum, bummin' in my fabric
Tell me what you know about a turtle race rabbit
I’m fantastic at fastening my tactics
Seems you need aid, lot of lemons in yo basket
Hold up let me ash this

[Hook]
I know how it feels
You’ve been hurt so bad, oh
I know how it feels
You’ve been hurt so bad, oh

[Verse 2]
I’m trying stimulate my mental
Rap so bad we just bump the instrumental
Copycats can’t copy raps so they trace it
My pen game like a blunt you should face it
You should face it, you should face it
Catch me with the b-boys rebels and the punks
Rum punch sucker drunk throwing nun-chucks
Cherry cola pedicure, rocking doobies to the store
Eating emcees so I be's what I munch
Ideas by the hunch
But I can’t afford to the sample that
Nothing in my pocket but a lighter and a Snapple fact
Back wood doobie, last night's clip
Might find a dollar for an Arizona sip

[Hook]
