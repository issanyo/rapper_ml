I'm in a battle with my heartbeat
The more I struggle, the more I get deep
I go full throttle down the dark streets
And there is trouble ahead, I get weak
It's like I'm running through a red light
Girl you know you make me weak
I should be hittin' all the brakes like
Hold up, hold up, oh
Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back us
We've gone too far, I'll drive you like a fast car
Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back us
We've gone too far, I'll drive you like a fast car
It isn't like me to get caught up
But when you running you're never quite free
I wasn't really out to find love
But now you found me and got me all weak
It's like I'm running through a red light
Girl you know you make me weak
I should be hittin' all the brakes like
Hold up, hold up, oh
Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back us
We've gone too far, I'll drive you like a fast car
Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back us
We've gone too far, I'll drive you like a fast car
Oh ooh whoa, oh ooh whoa
I'll drive you like a fast car
I'm in a battle with my heartbeat
The more I struggle the more I get deep
I go full throttle down the dark streets
And there is trouble ahead
I can't, I get weak, I get weak
I can't, I get weak, I get weak
Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back us
We've gone too far, I'll drive you like a fast car
Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back us
We've gone too far, I'll drive you like a fast car
Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back us
We've gone too far, I'll drive you like a fast car
Oh ooh whoa, oh ooh whoa
I'll drive you like a fast car, yeah
