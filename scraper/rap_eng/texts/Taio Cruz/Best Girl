Hey Hey Hey [x8]

Young girl you're the type I need
Baby you should know you are the one that I see
Everything about you is the way that I like
We can do it baby anytime of the night
Cause you stay down and you always go right
Even when we tired girl you wanna go twice

I just wanna tell you're the one that I need
Baby you're the one, the only one for me

So when we get the motion, oh, in the ocean
We keep it goin', keep, keep it goin'
I feel the lotion feel emotion
And I just gotta tell you one more time

[Chorus x2:]
You're the best damn girl in the whole wide world
Baby you're the best in the whole wide world
You're the only one that I'm ever gonna need
Baby you're the one, only one for me

The best damn girl I've ever seen in my life
Every time I look at you I'm proud that you're mine
You just got the shape, just the shape that I like
Everything about you got me feeling all right
So I know that we can do it, baby all night
We can make love anytime that you like

I just wanna tell you're the one that I need
Baby you're the one the only one for me

So when we get the motion, oh, in the ocean
We keep it goin', keep, keep it goin'
I feel the lotion feel emotion
And I just gotta tell you one more time

[x2:]
You're the best damn girl in the whole wide world
Baby you're the best in the whole wide world
You're the only one that I'm ever gonna need
Baby you're the one, only one for me

Best damn girl
Check it now mama you are the bestest
And I love the way that we dress, the freshest
You're in the passenger, I'm driving in the R8
Pumpin' that brand new shizzle, by the R.K
And I'm hardly, ever shy baby
That's why I say it lookin' at you in your eyes baby
I got the vehicle, let's take this for a ride baby
Now listen one more time

[x2:]
You're the best damn girl in the whole wide world
Baby you're the best in the whole wide world
You're the only one that I'm ever gonna need
Baby you're the one, only one for me
Best Girl
