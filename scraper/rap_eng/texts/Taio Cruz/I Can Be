[Verse 1]
Now I feel that this heart of mine has taken many falls
Still sometimes the rain can turn into a waterfall
The prettiest things can come out of the coldest night, yeah
And even with broken wings, sometimes you find your way to fly

[Chorus 1]
It's time to be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
It's time to be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
It's time to be

[Verse 2]
Now I feel that this soul of mine has had its many tolls, yeah
Still sometimes the pain is what we need for us to grow, yeah
So when it's time for me to look into my deeper side
I will, I will find a way to hold onto the love inside

[Chorus 2]
It's time to be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
Yes, I can be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
Yes, I can be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
Yes, I can be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
Yes, I can be

[Bridge]
See I can be anything I want to be
All I have to do is put my mind to it and I can do it
So what I want you to do is put your fist to the sky
And say it with me:

[Chorus 2]
It's time to be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
Yes, I can be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
Yes, I can be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
Yes, I can be bigger, bigger, stronger, stronger, harder, harder
Yes, I can be
I can be
