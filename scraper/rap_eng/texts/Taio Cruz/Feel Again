I believe that in time my heart will heal again
And I believe that in time my heart will feel again
So I keep on holding on, yeah
So I keep on being strong, yeah

'Cause I know one day I'm gonna feel again
I know one day I'm gonna feel again
And I know although my heart hurts now
I'll find a way to get up off the ground
Cause I know that one day I'm gonna feel again

I believe that this heart of mine can make it through
And I believe that my heart can make it over you
So I keep on holding on, yeah
So I keep on being strong, yeah

'Cause I know one day I'm gonna feel again
I know one day I'm gonna feel again
And I know although my heart hurts now
I'll find a way to get up off the ground
Cause I know that one day I'm gonna feel again

And though it's hard for me to breathe
And even harder to believe
I know that one day I'm gonna find
I'm gonna be just fine

'Cause one day I'm gonna feel again
I know one day I'm gonna feel again
And I know although my heart hurts now
I'll find a way to get up off the ground
Cause I know that one day I'm gonna feel again
