And I don't know if I can carry on without you, hey, hey
And I don't know if I can carry on without you, hey, hey

What more can I say, what more can I do?
I'm living a lie when I say I'm over you
Still falling apart, I'm broken at heart
Can't make a new start after all that we've been through
I can't let go, I don't know why
Lord knows I've tried
Still I'm broken inside

Here we are, once again
How can these tears still be rolling down my face again?
Here we are, once again
How can these tears still be rolling down my face again?
And I can't believe
I'm still crying, I'm, I'm still crying over you
I'm still crying, I'm, I'm still crying over you
I'm still crying, I'm, I'm still crying over you
I'm still crying, I'm, I'm still crying over you

Don't tell me you care, don't say you'll be there
We've been here before and I can't take it anymore
I know when you're lying, without even trying
You're back in my life and I'm back against the wall
I can't let go, I don't know why
Lord knows I've tried
Still I'm broken inside

Here we are, once again
How can these tears still be rolling down my face again?
Here we are, once again
How can these tears still be rolling down my face again?
And I can't believe
I'm still crying, I'm, I'm still crying over you
I'm still crying, I'm, I'm still crying over you
I'm still crying, I'm, I'm still crying over you
I'm still crying, I'm, I'm still crying over you

And I don't know if I can carry on without you, hey, hey
And I don't know if I can carry on without you, hey, hey

Here we are, once again
How can these tears still be rolling down my face again?
Here we are, once again
How can these tears still be rolling down my face again?
And I can't believe
I'm still crying, I'm, I'm still crying over you
I'm still crying, I'm, I'm still crying over you
I'm still crying, I'm, I'm still crying over you
I'm still crying, I'm, I'm still crying over you

I'm still crying over you
