Here you are again, sitting at our
Place with him
I can't believe that you would be
So cold
I know that you wanna be,with
Somebody new and that's cool with me
But this right here is just so cold

Didn't I give you all the things that I
Said I would
Didn't I take you all the places that
I said I would
Didn't I give you the love that I said
I would
Tell me how could you go, and...

[Chorus]
And Give my love away
And Give my love away
And Give my love away
And Give my love away
And Give my love away

And Give my love away
You're So cold

I'm hoping now my eyes deceive, cos
This really can't be what I see
I can't believe that you would be so cold
This house we bought for you and I, The
Bed we made love is where he lies?
Girl this right here is just so cold

Didn't I give you all the things that I said
I would
Didn't I take you to the places that I said
I would
Didn't I give you the love that I said I
Would
Tell me how could you go, and...

[Chorus x2]
