[Intro: Travie McCoy]
Yeah it's Travie
Aha
Taio
Haha
Let's Go

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Now I've never been
The one to dance
But we've got something
Going on in my pants
It's like I'm stuck in a trance
And I'd better take advantage
Who knows when
I'll get another chance
I feel like Breaking 2
Electric Boogaloo
You play Kelly I'll be O-zone
Travie Laz and Taio Cruz

[Verse 1: Taio Cruz]
Now I know how to get down on the floor, floor
Experienced in moves you can't ignore, 'nore
But something 'bout this beat that's got me hooked, hooked
Come over here and take a closer look, look

[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Woah, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

[Verse 2: Taio Cruz]
I do this just for kicks, just for the thrill, thrill
I got this high without takin' a pill, pill
This groove has got me way over the sun, sun
I'm dancin' like I am the only one, one

[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Woah, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]
I got my feet in the air
And my head on the ground
And the rest of my body
Is somewhere in the clouds
I'm coming down
No time soon
Like I'm tied to a couple
Hundred helium balloons
Looks like I'm a
Be up for a minute
Uh huh such a
Beautiful feeling, idn't it?
Yup when your body
Is so plateau
On a level that
Just feels so infinite

[Bridge: Taio Cruz]
The music's got me going higher
I feel like I can touch the sky...

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

[Travie McCoy]
It's your boy Travie McCoy
Taio Cruz
