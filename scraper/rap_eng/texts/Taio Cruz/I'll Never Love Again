[Verse 1]
I was wrong to let you walk right out of my life
I was dumb to think that I could survive
Was a fool to think the grass was greener on the other side
Now it hurts to know that it means that I...

[Chorus]
I'll never love again (Never, never)
I'll never love again (Never, never)
I'll never love again (Never, never)
I'll never love again (Never, never)
Hey, hey
I'll never find nobody who can love me like you do
I'll never find nobody to treat me the way you do
I'll never find nobody else babe, hey
I'll never fall in love again, eh

[Verse 2]
I was stupid to think that any love could compare
To the love that you gave to me from you
Was a fool, yes a fool to think that I'd find anywhere
Anyone is better for me then you..

[Chorus]
I'll never love again (Never, never)
I'll never love again (Never, never)
I'll never love again (Never, never)
I'll never love again (Never, never)
Hey, hey
I'll never find nobody who can love me like you do
I'll never find nobody to treat me the way you do
I'll never find nobody else babe, hey
I'll never fall in love again, eh

[Bridge](4x)
And now my heart is stone cold
Because you've gone, gone away (away), gone away (away)

Gone away (5x)

[Chorus]
I'll never love again (Never, never)
I'll never love again (Never, never)
I'll never love again (Never, never)
I'll never love again (Never, never)
Hey, hey
I'll never find nobody who can love me like you do
I'll never find nobody to treat me the way you do
I'll never find nobody else babe, hey
I'll never fall in love again, eh
I'll never find nobody who can love me like you do
I'll never find nobody to treat me the way you do
I'll never find nobody else babe, hey
I'll never fall in love again, eh
