I can't wait till you're gone away
'Cause then I can move on
I can't wait till you're gone away
'Cause then I can move on
Then I can say I'm finally over you
I'm, I'm finally over you
I'm, I'm finally over
I can't wait till you're gone away
'Cause then I can move on

Can't Wait Til You Are Gone (x2)

(Verse 1:)
You say that you are no longer in love with me
And Uh
You Can't Be
The One For Me
Told Me This Love Of Ours
Is Taking Us Down Different Roads
And Its Caused Us To Grow
Apart And So

Dont Say To Me
That You Wan't To Be
Be Good Friends With Me
Thats Just Teasing Me
Girl Its Best You Leave Now
Say Goodbye To Me
You Should Know Girl
That I'...

I can't wait till you're gone away
'Cause then I can move on
I can't wait till you're gone awau
'Cause then I can move on
Then I can say I'm finally over you
I'm, I'm finally over you
I'm, I'm finally over
I can't wait till you're gone away
'Cause then I can move on
