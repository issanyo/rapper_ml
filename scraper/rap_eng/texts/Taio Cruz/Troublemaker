[Verse 1]
I saw when you arrived looking like a supermodel
Your ass from the side looks just like a coke bottle
I love the way you ride, put that thing on full throttle
So get, get get get up on the saddle

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna see you moving like they're moving in jamaica
Pretend that I'm a dinner, she can be my salt shaker
You ain't tryin to hide it, girl you a troublemaker
And I'm a troublemaker maker maker maker maker

[Chorus]
I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
And sing out oeo oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa
Oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa

[Verse 2]
Sexy little mama, it's really nice to meet you
Can I be in your classroom and be your private teacher
If I bring out my camera, will you be in my feature
Cause we gon' do some things
Hope your daddy ain't a preacher

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna see you moving like they're moving in jamaica
Pretend that i am dinner you can be my salt shaker
You ain't tryin to hide it girl you're a troublemaker
And i'm a troublemaker maker maker maker maker

[Chorus]
I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
Sing it oeo oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa
Oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa
