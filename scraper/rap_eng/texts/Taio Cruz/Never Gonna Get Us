They build you up to watch you fall
Tell you, you can do it all
But they really wanna see you down in
The shadows
Cos they can't ever learn to fly
They don't wanna see you in the sky
But they really wanna see you down in
The shadows

[Pre Chorus]
(I know I know) they don't believe in us
(I know I know) we're meant to be
Because
We both share our lives in the light

[Chorus]
And I Say...
They ain't never go'n get us [x4]

Tell me are these words familiar
That man, he ain't good enough
But they really wanna see you down in
The shadows
They won't tell it to your face
All you gotta do is fall from grace
But they really wanna see you down in

The shadows

[Pre Chorus]
I know I know they don't believe in us
I know I know we're meant to be
Because
We both Share our lives in the light

[Chorus]
They don't know about the things we
Do, They don't understand it's just us
Two
Why they always tryina intervene, They
Don't understand that it's our dream
Well, to the left, to the left,we should
Tell them to get to the left
Why they always tryina intervene, They
Don't understand that it's our dream...

[Chorus x2]
