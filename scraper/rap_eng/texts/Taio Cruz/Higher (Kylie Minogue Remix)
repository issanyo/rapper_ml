[Verse 1: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
Now I know how to get down on the floor, (floor)
Experienced in moves you can't ignore, ('nore)
But something 'bout this beat just got me hooked, (hooked)
Come over here and take a closer look, (look)

[Bridge: Kylie Minogue & Taio Cruz]
Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Woah, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now

[Chorus — Kylie Minogue:]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

[Verse 2: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
I do this just for kicks, just for the thrill (thrill)
I got this high without takin' a pill, (pill)
This groove has got me way over the sun, sun
I'm dancin' like I am the only one, (one)

[Bridge: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground, woah
I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now

[Chorus — Taio Cruz]

[Taio Cruz (Both):]
The music's got me going higher
(I feel like I can touch the sky...)

[Chorus — Taio Cruz]
