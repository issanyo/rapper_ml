[Intro]
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying, "Ayo, gotta let go"
And I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying, "Ayo, baby, let's go"

[Verse 1]
I came to dance, dance, dance, dance
I hit the floor, 'cause that's my plans, plans, plans, plans
I'm wearing all my favorite brands, brands, brands, brands
Give me some space for both my hands, hands, hands, hands
Yeah, yeah
'Cause it goes on, and on, and on
And it goes on, and on, and on

[Chorus]
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying, "Ayo, gotta let go"
And I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying, "Ayo, baby, let's go"
'Cause we gon' rock this club
We gon' go all night
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite
'Cause I told you once
Now I told you twice
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite

[Bridge]
I'm gonna take it all, I
I'm gonna be the last one standing
Higher over all, I
I'm gonna be the last one landing
'Cause I believe it
And I, I just want it all, I just want it all
I'm gonna put my hands in the air, hands in the air
Put your hands in the air

[Breakdown]
Ugh! C'mon! Woo!

[Chorus]
Throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying, "Ayo, gotta let go"
And I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying, "Ayo, baby, let's go"
'Cause we gon' rock this club
We gon' go all night
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite
'Cause I told you once
Now I told you twice
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite
Like it's dynamite
