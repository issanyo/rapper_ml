[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Even though they try to knock me over
I never fall down
Cause I’m gonna wear the crown
With my feet on the ground
I know I’m gonna win
So I’mma get it
Watch me soar up to the sky
And fly now

[Hook]
I put my hands up, oh na na
And stand up, oh na na
And hold on, oh na na
To everything I know that makes me
So strong, oh na na
And go on, oh na na
I’m ok, oh na na
I’ll raise my voice to them and say

[Chorus]
Although they try to knock me down
Yeah, I’m gonna stand, I’m gonna stand my ground
Hey, I’m gonna open up my heart to give
Yeah, because it’s the only way to live
I’m gonna be positive
Yeah, positive
I’m gonna be positive
Yeah, positive
I’m gonna be positive
Yeah, positive
I’m gonna be positive
Yeah, positive

[Verse 2]
Even though you try to pull me under
I never drown now
So I’m gonna ride the wave
I’m not going down now
That’s why I’m gonna fight
And stand up for my right
Come and take my hand
And lets unite now

[Hook]
I put my hands up, oh na na
And stand up, oh na na
And hold on, oh na na
To everything I know that makes me
So strong, oh na na
And go on, oh na na
I’m ok, oh na na
I’ll raise my voice to them and say

[Chorus]
Although they try to knock me down
Yeah, I’m gonna stand, I’m gonna stand my ground
Hey, I’m gonna open up my heart to give
Yeah, because it’s the only way to live
I’m gonna be positive
Yeah, positive
I’m gonna be positive
Yeah, positive
I’m gonna be positive
Yeah, positive
I’m gonna be positive
Yeah, positive

[Bridge]
Hey, for me now it’s the only way to live
I’m gonna give it my all, all I can give
I’m gonna be higher than you’ve ever seen
I’m gonna stand taller than I’ve ever been
I’m gonna be everywhere you know I can

[Hook + Chorus]
Cause, although they try to knock me down
Yeah, I’m gonna stand, I’m gonna stand my ground
Hey, I’m gonna open up my heart to give
Yeah, because it’s the only way to live
I’m gonna be positive
Yeah, positive
I’m gonna be positive
Yeah, positive
I’m gonna be positive
Yeah, positive
I’m gonna be positive
Yeah, positive
Yeah
