[Verse 1]
Now I know how to get down on the floor, floor
Experienced in moves you can't ignore, 'nore
But something 'bout this beat that's got me hooked, hooked
Come over here and take a closer look, look

[Bridge]
Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Woah, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now

[Chorus]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

[Verse 2]
I do this just for kicks, just for the thrill, thrill
I got this high without takin' a pill, pill
This groove has got me way over the sun, sun
I'm dancin' like I am the only one, one

[Bridge]
Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Woah, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now

[Chorus]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
The music's got me going higher
I feel like I can touch the sky...

[Chorus]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
