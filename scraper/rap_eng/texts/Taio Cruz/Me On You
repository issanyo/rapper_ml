[Verse 1]
I just want you
Excuse me if I'm way too forward
I just want you, yeah
And pour me some truth
Filling my body, let's make it a hundred proof, yeah

[Chorus]
Maybe let me lose myself in you tonight
Cause I've been waiting so damn long to get to you
Nothing's ever felt as real as you and I
You got me faded, intoxicated-cated
Pour a little me on you
Pour a little me on you

[Verse 2]
Something 'bout you
That makes me body react to the way you move, yeah
I wanna taste you
Your skin is my liquor and this round is overdue, yeah

[Chorus]
And I just wanna lose myself in you tonight
Cause I've been waiting so damn long to get to you
Nothing's ever felt as real as you and I
You got me faded, intoxicated-cated
Pour a little me on you
Pour a little me on you
Pour a little me on you, on you

[Bridge]
Maybe let me lose myself in you tonight
Cause I've been waiting so damn long to get to you
Nothing's ever felt as real as you and I
You got me faded, intoxicated

[Chorus]
I've been waiting so damn long to get to you
Pour a little me on you
Pour a little me on you
Pour a little me on you
Pour a little me on you
Pour a little me on you
