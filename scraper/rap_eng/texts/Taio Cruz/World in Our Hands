No words can hurt us
No fire can burn us
No walls can hold us
Cause, no one controls us
Cause we're strong and we're fast
Our time has come at last
Just hold on, don't go anywhere

Cause we've waited all of our lives
Now we're seeing here in our rise
Baby no more waiting tonight
We got the world in our hands
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Baby no more waiting tonight
We got the world in our hands
Yeah, yeah, yeah

These hands can build up
All that we dreamed of
Our love will take us
Where no one can break us
Cause we're strong and we're fast
Our time has come at last
Just hold on, don't go anywhere

Cause we've waited all of our lives
Now we're seeing here in our rise
Baby no more waiting tonight
We got the world in our hands
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Baby no more waiting tonight
We got the world in our hands
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm not gonna lose you now
I'm not gonna lose you now

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Baby no more waiting tonight
We got the world in our hands
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Baby no more waiting tonight
We got the world in our hands
Yeah, yeah, yeah
