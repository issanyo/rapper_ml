Strings
You're the one, the one I adore
The only one my life was put here for
Though people try to poison with lies
I see the truth when I look in your eyes
You're the one that I wanna grow
Old with
The only one I want by my side
And you're the one that I know I can
Grow with
That is why I gotta say...

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fall in love unless I'm
Loving you, unless I'm loving you
I don't wanna fall in love unless I'm
Loving you, unless I'm loving you

Now it seems to me the angels above
Created you for me to love
And the way I feel it can't be denied, no
Cos you know it's true when you look in
My eyes
I'm the one that you wanna grow
Old with
The only one who's really by your side
And I'm the one that you know you can
Grow with
That is why you gotta say...

[Chorus]
If I'm not loving you I don't want no one
Else, it's true
Baby I'd much rather be by myself
Cos you
You do something to me I can't
Describe, that's why
That's why I gotta say I... that's why I
Gotta say I...

[Chorus]
I said I, I don't wanna fall in love
(unless I'm loving you)
Don't wanna fall in love
(unless I'm loving you, )
I said I, I don't wanna fall in love
(unless I'm loving you)
Don't wanna fall in love
(unless I'm loving you, )
I said I, I don't wanna fall in love
(unless I'm loving you)
Don't wanna fall in love
(unless I'm loving you, )
