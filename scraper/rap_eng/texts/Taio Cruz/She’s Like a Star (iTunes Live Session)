Like a star, a star, a star, a star
Like a star, a star, a star, a star
Like a star, a star, a star, a star
Like a star, a star, a star, a star
Like a star, a star, a star, a star
Like a star, a star, a star, a star

She's my everything, like a morning girl
She's my angel, up above my world
She's the only one, who understands me
That's why I called her, my new fan league

She's the only one that I want by my side
She's the only one that I believe can save my life
She makes me wanna be a better man ohh why
She's higher then the sky, the suns and the moon

She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby)
She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby)
She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby)
She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby)

First let me say, she's the best of me
Is it cliche, to say she's destiny
It's no one else but her, well at least for me
That's exactly why, I must now repeat

She's the only one that I want by my side
She's the only one that I believe can save my life
She makes me wanna be a better man ohh why
She's higher then the sky, the suns and the moon

She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby)
She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby)
She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby)
She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby)

She's my star, my light, starry night, aviator shades, cause she shine so bright
Beats on the G5, songs I write, just so I can take her on a G5 flights
Ya she my type, just my height, she's my fan, she's just right
She's like, “I think we might, go far”, I'm like, “you right”
She could be my angel wings, her voice sounds like an angel sings
Ya I'll be back with the trade mark strings
Just try to compliment the sounds she brings
She's like, “We could go far”, I'm like, “you you you are”
I'm like, “you you you are”
You are, my guiding star

She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby)
She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby)
She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby)
She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby)
