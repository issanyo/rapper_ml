[Hook: Taio Cruz]
I can't believe I got a second chance at love (x4)

[Verse 1: Tinchy Stryder]
Them mistakes I will learn from them
Now you've changed, you were stern back then
Close the case, where's the lid
Rebuild the bridge that I burned down then
Back to an item all resurrected
Now we're back online, we're connected
You're older, I'm wiser, let's paint this picture perfect

[Interlude: Taio Cruz]
I could have been anywhere by now
But nowhere feels better than home
(Yeah yeah yeah)
If you don't know you should know right now
That you're the only that I want
(Oh oh oh)

[Hook: Taio Cruz]

[Break: Taio Cruz]
Yeah (x19) oh

[Verse 2: Tinchy Stryder]
Yo, if the vision ain't clear for now
Wipe my eyes, and I cleanse them out
Went from up to down, till I nearly drowned
And now we're back around, 360
And I missed you more than you miss me
It's a four letter word that my lips read
Now we're doing it faster than lightspeed
And the time is right so kiss me

[Interlude] + [Hook]

[Break] (x2)

[Verse 3: Tinchy Stryder]
They said the doors were closing in
Grab the towels, throw them in
Let's try a second time
If it's wrong we fit the crime
Now the doors are opening
Take my hand, let's try again
Yeah, we're born to fight
Welcome some soldiers in

[Hook]

[Break] (x2)

[Outro: Taio Cruz]
I can't believe I got a second chance at love (x2)
