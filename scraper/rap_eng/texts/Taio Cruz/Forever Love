Should we say go?
Should we say stay?
Do we stand tall?
Or do we fade away?
Do we keep on?
Or Do we fall down?
I won't say goodbye
I won't say that now

(I'll keep loving you forever
Because I swore I would
You know my word is good) [x2]

Love you
(Forever and ever love you) [x8]

Should we say go?

Should we say stay?
Do we stand tall?
Or do we fade away?
Do we keep on?
Or Do we fall down?
I won't say goodbye
I won't say that now

(I'll keep loving you forever
Because I swore I would
You know my word is good) [x3]

Love
