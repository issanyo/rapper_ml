[Verse 1:]
Baby, Talk To Me
What Is Going On
Cause Lately
We Ain't Been
Spendin Time Alone
Last Night
When I Touched Your Hand
You Didn't Wanna Hold
Today
No Kiss Goodbye
Jus Said You Had To Go

[Chorus:]
If You're Leavin Me, Baby
I Just Wanna Know
I Just Wanna Know
If You're Done With Me, Baby
I Just Wanna Know
I Just Wanna Know
I Just Wanna Know
Yeah Yeah
Yeahhhhhh

[Verse 2:]
Listen
If You Care
Something You Wanna Say?
Please Don't
Dont Hold It Back
It'll Come Out Someday
I Am

I'm Strong Enough
To Mend My Broken Heart (Oh Yeaa)
If You Say
That You And I
Are Betta Off Apart

[Chorus:]
If You're Leavin Me, Baby
I Just Wanna Know
I Just Wanna Know
If You're Done With Me, Baby
I Just Wanna Know
I Just Wanna Know
I Just Wanna Know
Strings

[Bridge:]
Yea Yea
Oh Yeah
Oh Yeahhhh
I Just Wanna Know
I Wanna Know

[Chorus X2:]
If You're Leavin Me, Baby
I Just Wanna Know
I Just Wanna Know
If You're Done With Me, Baby
I Just Wanna Know
I Just Wanna Know
I Just Wanna Know
Yeahhhh
