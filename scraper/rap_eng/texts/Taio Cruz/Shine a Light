[Verse 1: Tom]
Tell me are you feeling strong
Strong enough to love someone
And make it through the hardest storm
And bad weather?
Will you pull me from the flames
Hold me ‘til I feel no pain
And give me shelter from the rain
Forever?

[Pre-Chorus: Danny]
Where can I find her?

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
She took the light and left me in the dark, yeah
She left me with a broken heart, yeah
Now I’m on my own
If anybody sees her
Shine a light on her
Shine a light on her
Shine a light on her
If anybody sees her

[Verse 2: Danny]
Tell me can you hear my voice
Loud and clear above the noise
And even if I had the choice
I would not give up

[Pre-Chorus: Tom]
Where I can find her?

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
She took the light and left me in the dark, yeah
She left me with a broken heart, yeah
Now I’m on my own
If anybody sees her
Shine a light on her
Shine a light on her
Shine a light on her
If anybody sees her

[Bridge: Tom]
Shine a light on her
Shine a light on her
Shine a light on her
If anybody sees her

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
She took the light and left me in the dark, yeah
She left me with a broken heart, yeah
Now I’m on my own
If anybody sees her
Shine a light on her
Shine a light on her
Shine a light on her
If anybody sees her
Shine a light on her
Shine a light on her
Shine a light on her
If anybody sees her
