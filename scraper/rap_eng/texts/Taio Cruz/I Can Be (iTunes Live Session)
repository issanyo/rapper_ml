Now I feel that this hold of mine has taken many forms
Still sometimes the rain can turn into a waterfall
The prettiest things can come out of the coldest mind, yeah
And even with broken wings, sometimes you find your way to fly

It's time to be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
It's time to be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
It's time to be

Now I feel that this soul of mine has had its many tolls, yeah
Still sometimes the pain is what we need for us to grow, yeah
So when it's time for me to look into my deepest side
I will, I will find a way to hold onto the love inside

It's time to be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
Yes, I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
Yes, I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
Yes, I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
Yes, I can be

See I can be anything I want to be
All I have to do is put my mind to it and I can do it
So what I want you to do is put your fist to the sky and say it with me:

I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
Yes, I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
Yes, I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
Yes, I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
Yes, I can be
I can be
