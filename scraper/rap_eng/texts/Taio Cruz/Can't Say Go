(Uh, oh, uh, oh, uh, oh, uh, oh, uh, oh)
Sometimes when we fight, I think maybe I
Should just let you leave and push you out of my life
But I don't decide 'cause I know that I
Just can't survive without you

And I know inside I never let you go
'Cause I'm sure you're the one
Even through the rain it's clear, you're the one I want
And no matter how we fuss and fight, girl
You should always know, I just can't stop loving you

That's why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
Why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
Why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
Why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)

That's why I can't say go
(Uh, oh, uh, oh)
I said, "That's why I can't say go"
(Uh, oh, uh, oh, uh, oh)

Baby I've tried, to tell you goodbye
One look from your eyes
And those dumb thoughts say goodbye
It's foolish to try when I know that I
I just can't survive without you

And I know inside I never let you go
'Cause I'm sure you're the one
Even through the rain it's clear that you're the one I want
And no matter how we fuss and fight, girl
You should always know, I just can't stop loving you

That's why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
Why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
Why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
Why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
That's why I can't say go
(Uh, oh)

To see through the night, you are my light
So even when we fight I know it's going to be alright
You have my soul, I'm just letting you know

That's why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
Why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
Why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
Why I can't say go
(That's why I can't say go)
That's why I can't say go
I said, "That's why I can't say go"
