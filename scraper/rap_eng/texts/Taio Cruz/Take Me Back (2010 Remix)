Flee, she's telling me she's over me
Babe don't run no jokes on me
In my mind I'm taken back
And now it feels like make believe

Yeah!

I play the game
Off the leash I strayed away
I found my way back home
Let me in I'm at the gates stryde's!

I didn't mean to let you go
I didn't mean to let you down
I'm sorry that I led you on
But I really need you around

Tell me can I have you here
'cause I really need you right now
And I'm hoping you'll take me
Hoping, Hoping you'll take me back

Oh I..I..

I'm sorry I misleaded you pretty lady
I'm sorry I mistreated you pretty lady
I'm sorry that I hurt you pretty lady
All I need to know is

Can you take me back? can you take me back?
Can you take me back? can you take me back?
Can you take me back? can you take me back?
Can you take me back? can you take me back?

'cause I can't live without ya oh oh oh
(girl I can't live without ya oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh)

I really wanna start again
I really wanna start it right
I just wanna do what I can
'cause I really think you and I

Should give it just one more chance
Should give it just one more try
I'm hoping you take me
Hoping, Hoping you take me back

Yo I'm hoping you take me back
That's weight of my shoulders and aching back
Turn a different [~unverified~] life
I would show you that

Till I'm stuck in your mind
Like a favourite track
I'll find your spot
That's kinda soft

My cheeky smile I'm wiping off
If you say no
I will deal with that
I'm hoping you'll take me back

Flee, (Flee)

I'm sorry I misleaded you pretty lady
I'm sorry I mistreated you pretty lady
I'm sorry that I hurt you pretty lady
All I need to know is

Can you take me back? can you take me back?
Can you take me back? can you take me back?
Can you take me back? can you take me back?
Can you take me back? can you take me back?

'cause I can't live without ya oh oh oh
(girl I can't live without ya oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh)

Girl I need you back woah
('cause I can't live without ya)
'cause I actually thought I could cope on my on woah
('cause I can't live without ya)

Girl I need you back woah
('cause I can't live without ya)
