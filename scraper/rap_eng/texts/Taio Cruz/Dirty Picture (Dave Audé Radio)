[Verse 1: Taio Cruz]
I could dream of ways to see you
I could close my eyes to dream
I could fantasize about you
Tell the world what I believe
But whenever I'm not with you
It's so hard for me to see
I need to see a picture of you
A special picture just for me

[Chorus: Taio Cruz & Ke$ha]
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
Just send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
Picture, picture, picture, picture
Picture, picture, picture, picture for me

[Post-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Uh
Snap
Uh
Snap

[Verse 2: Taio Cruz]
Whenever you are gone, I just wanna be with ya
Please don't get me wrong, I just wanna see a picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture

[Verse 3: Ke$ha]
Whenever you are gone, I just wanna be wit ya
Please don't get me wrong, I just wanna see your picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture

[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz with Ke$ha]
I could dream of ways to see you
I could close my eyes to dream
Fantasize about this with you
But the way is never seen, oh

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
Just send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
Picture, picture, picture, picture
Picture, picture, picture, picture for me

[Post-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Uh
Snap
Uh
Snap

[Bridge: Taio Cruz & Ke$ha]
Whenever you are gone, I just wanna be wit ya
Please don't get me wrong, I just wanna see your picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture

[Verse 4: Ke$ha]
When you're all alone, boy, I got something to give ya
Will ya play along if I take a dirty picture?
I'll take a dirty picture for ya
Take a dirty picture
I'll take a dirty picture for ya
Take a dirty picture (picture)

[Chorus: Taio Cruz & Ke$ha]
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
Just send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
Picture, picture, picture, picture
Picture, picture, picture, picture, picture, picture

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
Just send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
Picture, picture, picture, picture
Picture, picture, picture, picture for me
Picture, picture, picture, picture
Picture, picture, picture, for me, for me
