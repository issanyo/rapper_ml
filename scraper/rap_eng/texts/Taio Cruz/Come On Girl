Wanna keep it private and undercover that's cool

You wanna take a bite?
Come whip my appetite
But put me in, do your thang, make my head spin
So c'mon take me away
You better take me away
You better hit the spot
If you want I can make you pop
So let go, electro, take it nice and slow
C'mon boy, c'mon boy, c'mon boy!

[Chorus]
Now I know that you want it, you've indicated
It's obvious I need to just make a decision
Bout' what I'm gonna say
Tell me what I gotta say

To take you away with me
To take you away with me
To take you away with me
To take you away with me
To take you away!
