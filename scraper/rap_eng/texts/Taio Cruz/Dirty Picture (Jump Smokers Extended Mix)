[Verse 1: Taio Cruz]
I could dream of ways to see you
I could close my eyes to dream
I could fantasize about you
Tell the world what I believe
But whenever I'm not with you
It's so hard for me to see
I need to see a picture of you
A special picture just for me, yeah

[Chorus: Taio Cruz & Ke$ha]
So take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
Just send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
Picture, picture, picture, picture
Picture, picture, picture, picture
Picture, picture, picture

[Post-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Snap
Snap
Uh

[Verse 2: Jumpsmokers]
Check the dirty beats
We got ya'll
Check the dirty beats
Check the dirty beats
We got ya'll
Check the dirty beats

[Verse 3: Taio Cruz]
Whenever you are gone, I just wanna be with ya
Please don't get me wrong, I just wanna see a picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture

[Verse 4: Ke$ha]
Whenever you are gone, I just wanna be wit ya
Please don't get me wrong, I just wanna see your picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture

[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz with Ke$ha]
I could dream of ways to see you
I could close my eyes to dream
Fantasize about this with you
But the way is never seen, oh

[Chorus: Taio Cruz & Ke$ha]
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
Send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture

[Post-Chorus: Taio Cruz & Ke$ha]
Snap

[Verse 5: Jumpsmokers]
Right now, I can't be with ya
And I don't wanna forget ya
Please refresh my memory, woth your dirty picture
Yeah, baby, I am alone
Wish I could be near ya
Just hold up your camera phone to your bathroom mirror
And take a dirty picture for me, act like you're in Playboy
Show your sexy pose, with no clothes
Baby, can you do that for me?
Nice! Who looks that nice?
I double take, had to look at twice
I bet you won't look at price
I fly, you go book that flight
First, go take that photo
Let's go down to [?]
The dirtier, the better
Baby, case you didn't know so

[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz with Ke$ha]
I could dream of ways to see you
I could close my eyes to dream
Fantasize about this with you
But the way is never seen, oh

[Chorus: Taio Cruz & Ke$ha]
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
Send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
