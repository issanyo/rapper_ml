[Intro: Amelle & (Tinchy)]
Woah woah and I will never leave ya
(I will never leave)
Woah woah and I will never leave ya

Woah woah and I will never leave ya
(I will never leave)
Woah woah and I will never leave ya

[Verse 1: Tinchy]
Hey yo I've been there, right here on the Bow streets
Late nights tryna write, mum saying go sleep
A king here, music world at my own feet
Dealing with the mainstream, I thank the Lord daily
I'm sincere and I've been from the start
Ask Dyl, ask Will, man I've had it in my heart
So I've dropped tears, and everything's changed
Reminiscing them days, tryna turn the page cause I

[Bridge: Amelle]
I've been around the world, I've seen so many places
Living the life, I've worked so hard to make it
Trading the world for money, stars and power
Living my life at a hundred miles an hour

[Chorus: Amelle]
And I'm loving you like it was the first time
I'm still loving you like it was the first time
Woah woah and I will never leave ya
Woah woah and I will never leave ya

[Verse 2: Tinchy]
You must be joking, don't tell me that it's over
I'm driving the scene forward, I'm a chauffeur
It's open, so come,w e all enter
Tired of being in the back, now we're centre

Only right I took my chance, now I'm bringing it home, cause I

[Bridge]

[Chorus: Amelle]
And I'm loving you like it was the first time
I'm still loving you like it was the first time
Woah woah and I will never leave ya
Woah woah and I will never leave ya
Woah woah and I will never leave ya
Woah woah and I will never leave ya

[Middle 8: Tinchy & Amelle]
And yo I dived right in
And now I'm swimming in the deep end
And I've been gone since the weekend
So how's your week been?
Without me, how you keeping?
Well this is comeback season
Well this is comeback season
I call it comeback, I've seen the whole map
And I'll be back by the evening

[Chorus/Outro]
And I'm loving you like it was the first time
I'm still loving you like it was the first time
And I'm loving you like it was the first time
I'm still loving you like it was the first time
Woah woah and I will never leave ya
Woah woah and I will never leave ya
Woah woah and I will never leave ya
Woah woah and I will never leave ya
