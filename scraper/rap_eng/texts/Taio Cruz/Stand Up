[Chorus]
Cause I came here to dance
I'm gonna put up my hands
And stand up, stand up
Cause I came here to dance
I'm gonna put up my hands
And stand up, stand up
Get up, get up
When the music gets a hold of you
Get up, get up
When the music gets control of you
Get up, get up
When the music gets a hold of you
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up

[Bridge]
I can see the light calling me out
I can see the search light spinning around
I can feel the home where I belong
I can feel the music turning me on
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (on)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (turning me on)

[Chorus]
Cause I came here to dance
I'm gonna put up my hands
And stand up, stand up
Cause I came here to dance
I'm gonna put up my hands
And stand up, stand up
Get up, get up
When the music gets a hold of you
Get up, get up
When the music gets control of you
Get up, get up
When the music gets a hold of you
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up

[Bridge]
I've got this emotion covering me
While moving in the fast lane taking the lead
There's nowhere to hide. feeling this strong
I can feel the music turning me on
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (on)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (turning me on)
Turning me on

[Chorus]
Cause I came here to dance
I'm gonna put up my hands
And stand up, stand up
Cause I came here to dance
I'm gonna put up my hands
And stand up, stand up
Get up, get up
When the music gets a hold of you
Get up, get up
When the music gets control of you
Get up, get up
When the music gets a hold of you
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up

[Verse]
Ok Cheryl let's dance, cause I just cut my advance
'So I can slide on my Louboutins'
And I'm gonna put on my brand new vans
And take it to the club
I don't give a what, and you don't give a what
We going while out like we just got paid
Looking so fresh in our Rockstarr shades

[Chorus]
Cause I came here to dance
I'm gonna put up my hands
And stand up, stand up
Cause I came here to dance
I'm gonna put up my hands
And stand up, stand up
Get up, get up
When the music gets a hold of you
Get up, get up
When the music gets control of you
Get up, get up
When the music gets a hold of you
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
