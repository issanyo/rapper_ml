[Verse 1: Taio Cruz]
Take all the love we had
Give all the love in back
Burn all the words we had
But don't you dare, don't you dare come crawlin' back
Take everything you need
Take all the blood I bleed
Burn all this left of me
But don't you dare, don't you dare come crawlin' back

[Verse 2: Taio Cruz]
Go if you have to leave
Go where you have to be
Don't you feel [?] of me
Just don't you dare, don't you dare come crawlin' back
Do what you have to do
Do what is best for you
Go if you think it's cool
Just don't you dare, don't you dare come crawlin' back

[Verse 3: Taio Cruz]
Cuz I still believe in love
You gave it all back
So don't you come crawling here
Don't you dare come crawlin' back

Don't you dare come crawlin' back
