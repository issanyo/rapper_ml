[Verse 1]
I’ve got nowhere left to run
I’ve got nowhere left to hide
If you leave me
If you leave me
I would die
I’ve got nowhere left to run
I’ve got nowhere left to hide
If you leave me
If you leave me
I would die

[Pre-Chorus]
(Without you, I’m not a survivor)
Without you
(Without you, I’m not a survivor)
Without you
(Without you, I’m not a survivor)
I can’t live

[Chorus]
‘Cause I need you
Yes, I need you
To save me
To save me
From doom

[Verse 2]
I’ve got no more love to give
I’ve got no more tears to cry
If you leave me
If you leave me
I would die

[Chorus]
‘Cause I need you
Yes, I need you
To save me
To save me
‘Cause I need you
Yes, I need you
To save me
To save me
From the doom

[Bridge]
I've got nowhere to run
Nowhere to run
Oh

[Chorus]
‘Cause I need you
Yes, I need you
To save me
To save me

[Outro]
I’ve got nowhere left to run
I’ve got nowhere left to hide
If you leave me
If you leave me
I would die
I've got nowhere
I've got nowhere
If you leave me
If you leave me
I would die
(Without you, I'm not a survivor)
