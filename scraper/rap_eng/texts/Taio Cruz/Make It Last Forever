Wake
Me, I'm dreaming
Is my heart still beating
Cause this life has never felt so good
So hot, she's steaming
With no rhyme, or reason
Sexy has never looked so good

Right here, right now
This look on your face
I don't want it to fade
So strong I know
This just won't break
Like a diamond

Let's let this feeling go on
And on, and on, and on
Going on, and on, and on
Let's let this feeling go on
And on, and on, and on
Going on, and on, and on

Make it last forever

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Make it last forever
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Make it last forever

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Make it last forever
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Make it last forever

Last night we rocked them
Tonight we poppin'
Tomorrow do it all again
This life we living, is just the beginning
Hell yeah, you know there's more to come
Right here, right now
This look on your face
I don't want it to fade
So strong I know
This just won't break
Like a diamond

Let's let this feeling go on
And on, and on, and on
Going on, and on, and on
Let's let this feeling go on
And on, and on, and on
Going on, and on, and on

Make it last forever

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Make it last forever
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Make it last forever

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Make it last forever
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Make it last forever

Going on, and on, and on
Let's let this feeling go on
And on, and on, and on
Going on, and on, and on

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Make it last forever
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Make it last forever

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Make it last forever
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Make it last forever
