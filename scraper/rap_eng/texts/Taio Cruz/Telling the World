Every part in my heart I’m giving out
Every song on my lips I’m singing out
Any fear in my soul I’m letting go
And anyone who ask I’ll let them know

She’s the one, she’s the one
I say it loud
She’s the one, she’s the one
I say it proud

Ring a bell, Ring a bell
For the whole crowd
Ring a bell, Ring a bell

I’m telling the world
That I’ve found a girl
The one I can live for
The one who deserves

Every part in my heart I’m giving out
Every song on my lips I’m singing out
Any fear in my soul I’m letting go
And anyone who ask I’ll let them know

She’s the one, she’s the one
I say it loud
She’s the one, she’s the one
I say it proud

Ring a bell, Ring a bell
For the whole crowd
Ring a bell, Ring a bell

I’m telling the world
That I’ve found a girl
The one I can live for
The one who deserves

To give all my heart
A reason to fly
The one I can live for
A reason for life

Oe oh oe oh
Yeah yeah
Oe oh oe oh
Yeah yeah
Oe oh oe oh
Yeah yeah
