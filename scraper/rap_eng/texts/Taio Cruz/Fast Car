I'm in a battle with my heartbeat
The more I struggle the more I get deep
I go full throttle down the dark streets
And there is trouble ahead I get weak
It's like I'm running through a red light
Girl you know you make me weak
I should be hittin' all the brake lights
Hold up, hold up oh!

Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back cause
We've gone too far
I'll drive you like a fastcar

Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back cause
We've gone too far
I'll drive you like a fastcar

It isn't like me to get caught up
But when you running you're never quite free
I wasn't really meant to find love
But now you found me and got me all weak
It's like I'm running through a red light
Girl you know you make me weak
I should be hittin' all the brake lights
Hold up, hold up oh!

Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back cause
We've gone too far
I'll drive you like a fastcar

Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back cause
We've gone too far
I'll drive you like a fast car
(oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
I'll drive you like a fast car

I'm in a battle with my heartbeat
The more I struggle the more I get deep
I go full throttle down the dark streets
And there is trouble ahead I get weak
I get weak I get weak

Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back cause
We've gone too far
I'll drive you like a fastcar

Girl you really turn me on, on, on,on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back cause
We've gone too far
I'll drive you like a fastcar
(oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
I'll drive you like a fastcar!
