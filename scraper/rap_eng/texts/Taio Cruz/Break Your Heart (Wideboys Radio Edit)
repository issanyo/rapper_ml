(Whoa) LUDA!*
Now I may not be the worst or the best
But you gotta respect my honesty (whoa)
And I may break your heart
But I don't really think there's anybody as bomb as me (whoa)
So you can take this chance, in the end
Everybody's gonna be wondering how you deal (whoa)
You might say this is Ludacris
But Taio Cruz tell her how you feel

Now listen to me baby (uh uh oh oh)
Before I love and leave you (uh uh oh oh)
They call me heart breaker (uh uh oh oh)
I don't wanna deceive you (uh uh oh oh oh)

If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby from the start

I'm only gonna break break your, break break your heart
Whoa, whoa

There's no point trying to hide it (uh uh oh oh)
No point trying to evade it (uh uh oh oh)
I know I got a problem (uh uh oh oh)
Problem with misbehaving (uh uh oh oh oh)

If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby from the start

I'm only gonna break break your, break break your heart

That's all I'm gonna do woman
(Whoa) Listen now, I'm only gonna break your heart
And shatter and splatter it all into little bitty pieces (whoa)
Whether or not you get it all together
Then its finder's keepers and losers weepers (whoa)
See I'm not trying to lead you on
No I'm only trying to keep it real (whoa)
You might say this is Ludacris
But Taio Cruz tell her how you feel

(Eh) and I know karma's gonna get me back for being so cold (eh)
Like a big bad wolf I'm born to be bad and bad to the bone (eh)
If you fall for me I'm only gonna tear you apart (eh)
Told ya from the start (eh)

I'm only gonna break break your, break break your heart
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
