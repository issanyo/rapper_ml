I saw when you arrived looking like a supermodel
Your ass from the side looks just like a coke bottle
I love the way you ride put that thing on full throttle
So get, get get get, get up on the saddle
I wanna see you move like they're moving in Jamaica
Pretend that I'm a dinner she can be my saltshaker
You ain't tryin to hide it, girl you're a troublemaker
And i'm a troublemaker
I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
Sing out
Sexy little mama, you screaming nice to meet you
Can i be in your classroom and be your private teacher
If I bring out my camera will you be in my feature
'Cause we're gonna do some things, hope your daddy ain't no preacher
I wanna see you move like they're moving in Jamaica
Pretend that I'm a dinner she can be my saltshaker
You ain't tryin to hide it, girl you're a troublemaker
And i'm a troublemaker
I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
Sing out
I love the way you dance, oh it makes me crazy
I wanna see you move so just let it go baby
I feel like we can do this if you wanna go with it
Let's take it to the top, pu-pu-push it to the limit
Take it to the top, pu-pu-push it to the limit
I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
Sing out
