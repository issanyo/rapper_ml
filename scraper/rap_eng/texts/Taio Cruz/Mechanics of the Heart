[Verse 1]
Symptoms of being scared
Feeling cold, feeling lonely on your own
I can feel this fear getting stronger
And it's taking over, I'm losing control

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you are not religious
Then how will you ever believe?
And if I don't know procedures
Then how am I meant to proceed

[Chorus]
To mend your heart?
To mend your heart?
To mend your heart?
To mend your heart?
I try my best to operate on you
Trying to learn the mechanics of a heart

[Verse 2]
Broken hearted, torn apart
What was left on the floor
Has been smashed into pieces
First she hurt it, then she deserted
But I'm trying to save it
Before your heart ceases

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you are not religious
Then how will you ever believe?
And if I don't know procedures
Then how am I meant to proceed

[Chorus]
To mend your heart?
To mend your heart?
To mend your heart?
To mend your heart?
I try my best to operate on you
Trying to learn the mechanics of a heart
I try my best to operate on you
Trying to learn the mechanics of a heart
I try my best to operate on you
Trying to learn the mechanics of a heart
I try my best to operate on you
Trying to learn the mechanics of a heart
To mend your heart
To mend your heart
To mend your heart
To mend your heart
