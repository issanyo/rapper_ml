[Intro](2x)
'Cause I can't live without ya, oh, oh, oh, oh
Girl, I can't live without ya, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I didn't mean to let you go
I didn't mean to let you down
I'm sorry that I did you wrong
But I really need you around
Tell me can I have you here?
'Cause I really need you right now
And I'm hoping you take me
Hoping you, hoping you take me back
Oh I, I

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry I misleaded you pretty lady
I'm sorry I mistreated you pretty lady
I'm sorry that I hurt you pretty lady
And all I need to know is:

[Chorus]
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
(There's one thing I need to know)

'Cause I can't live without ya, oh, oh, oh, oh
Girl, I can't live without ya, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I really wanna start again
I really wanna start it right
I just wanna do what I can
Cause I really think you and I
Should give it just one more chance
And give it just one more try
I'm hoping you take me
Hoping you, hoping you take me back
Oh I

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry I misleaded you pretty lady
I'm sorry I mistreated you pretty lady
I'm sorry that I hurt you pretty lady
And all I need to know is:

[Chorus]
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
(If I change the way I'm home)
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
(There's one thing I need to know)

'Cause I can't live without ya, oh, oh, oh, oh
Girl, I can't live without ya, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge](2x)
Girl I need you back, woah
('Cause I can't live without ya)
Cause I actually thought I could cope on my own
('Cause I can't live without ya)

I'm hoping you take me
Hoping you, hoping you take me back
Oh I

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry I misleaded you pretty lady
I'm sorry I mistreated you pretty lady
I'm sorry that I hurt you pretty lady
And all I need to know is:

[Chorus]
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
(If I change the way I'm home)
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
(There's one thing I need to know)

'Cause I can't live without ya, oh, oh, oh, oh
Girl, I can't live without ya, oh, oh, oh, oh
