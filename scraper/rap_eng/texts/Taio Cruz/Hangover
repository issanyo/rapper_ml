[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep, keep it going, going, going, going!

[Verse 1: Taio Cruz]
I got a little bit trashed last night, night
I got a little bit wasted, yeah yeah
I got a little bit mashed last night, night
I got a little shit faceted, yeah yeah (well)
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm on the roof
If you don't know
Well now you know

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep keep it going, come on!

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Drink up, 'cause a party ain't a party 'till you ride out through it
End up on the floor with cameraman you clueless
Officer like what the hell is you doing?
Stumbling, fumbling, you wanna what? Come again
Give me Henn, give me gin, give me liquor
Give me champagne bubbles 'till I'm bent
What happens after that? If you inspired then tell a friend
Like oh my homie Taio, we can all sip again
Get it in and again and again, leave evidence
Wasted, so what? Irrelevant
Beer keg to the head, who's selling it
I got a hangover, that's my medicine
Don't mean to brag or sound too intelligent
A little Jack can't hurt this veteran
I show up but I never throw up
So let the drinks pour up, pour up

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep keep it going, come on!

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep keep it going, come on!
