Day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At-At-At night!

[Part 5 - Need You Now]
It's a quarter after one
And I'm a little drunk
And I need you now
Said I wouldn't call
But I lost all control
And I need you now
And I don't know how
I can do without
I just need you now

[Part 6 - Baby]
And I was like....
Baby, Baby, Baby
Baby, Baby, Baby
I though you'd always be mine

[Part 7 - So What]
So, so what, I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't need you
And guess what? I'm having more fun
And now what we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright, I'm just fine and you're a tool
So, so what, I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight

[Part 8 - I Kissed a Girl]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Part 9 - Fireflies]
And I like to make myself believe
That planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake
When I'm asleep
Because everything is never as it seems

[Part 10 - Blame It]
Blame it on the goose
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on the Tron
Got me in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka
Blame it on the henny
Blame it on the blue-tap
Got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

[Part 11 - Replay]
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
Its like my iPod's stuck on replay
Stuck on replay
Stuck on replay
Replay
Replay
Replay-ay-ay

[Part 12 - Down]
Baby, are you down?
Down? down? down?
Baby, are you down?
