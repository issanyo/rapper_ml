Frank on the go
Sryan on the line
Taio on call
Nasty!
We all know she's a nasty girl, a nasty girl, a nasty girl, a nasty girl
A nasty girl, a nasty girl, a nasty girl

Yo Yo Yo Yo
Hey girl I like your flava
Wish I could be your neighbour
Must be coffee by the way you shakinh your perk-u-lator
I'm the smooth operator
Hot mommy motivator
What I really wanna do
Put that thing on you
Butter up yo hot potato
Gettin more dough then bakers
Rim's spinnin like I knew your break is
You got it all give me a call
I'm ballin like the Lakers
Hey ma now I won't chase ya
Sweetheart ignore them haters
Let's have some fun
Bittys' got me on the run
Come on girl get this paper

[Frank Griffin]
It's sunny outside, and girl, I love everything
I feel those things for you I'll be
Lovin' you instantly you're on top of me when
You call me Usher Raymond now baby tell what
You want jus come over me
Baby nothing ventured nothing gained oh I'm telling
You that would give up everything and I just
Wanna take it to the top with me
Don't wanna waste your time and I'm
So happy lately you and me, need me
When you when you're going through withdraws

[Chorus]
I got a lot of money in my pocket
But the next minute my cousin stole it
She's a nasty girl
I bought a pet
But the next day she came over and she stole it
She's a nasty girl
I asked her do you want to volunteer for a dance
And she shouted back no!!!!
She's a nasty girl

[Taio Cruz]
(Yo she's a nasty girl)
(Yo she's a nasty girl)

Wanna give it to me now not later
Mommy's body was a dime, can't hate her
What a brother gonna do when the bitty rolls through
Who's lookin just like Jada
We hit the elevator
Of course there's always haters
But it didn't matter yo
We were puttin on a show
Free for all your spectators
Mommy threw it like a champ (Yo wait up)
Yo I didn't even know her name (What!?)
Bitty's opened up your eyes
Haters better recognize

[Frank Griffin]
I wanna do is spend all my soul, you have
Given me life, I found some lovin'
I don't know, I think you made me lose
My way I feel naked singing every note I never
Felt like you want me to see you don't
Need 'em anymore oh, think twice
'cause they keep going in and
Out it again and again every time that
I want it cause you shakin' it
All for me to the music of the day and
The way that you walkin

[Chorus]
I got a lot of money in my pocket
But the next minute my cousin stole it
She's a nasty girl
I bought a pet
But the next day she came over and she stole it
She's a nasty girl
I asked her do you want to volunteer for a dance
And she shouted back no!!!!
She's a nasty girl

[Sryan]
I'm in the Escalade, you in the Navigator
I gave her a big twirl
We all know she's a nasty girl
I'm in the Escalade, you in the Navigator
I gave her a big twirl
We all know she's a nasty girl

[Frank Griffin]
The one you need is candlelight and a lot giving me happiness I'll be
Lovin' you you have three four kids
By you baby I need you the moon I will
Let no harm come your way friends
Say I love you and when he broke my
Heart knows that's the way I feel those things
For you and me in a bentley could
You please baby please say you can you
I'm in the Escalade, you in the Navigator
I gave her a big twirl
We all know she's a nasty girl

[Chorus]
I got a lot of money in my pocket
But the next minute my cousin stole it
She's a nasty girl
I bought a pet
But the next day she came over and she stole it
She's a nasty girl
I asked her do you want to volunteer for a dance
And she shouted back no!!!!
She's a nasty girl
