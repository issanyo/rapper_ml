[Verse 1]
Motherfucker never loved me
Motherfucker never loved me
So I’ll take it back, what I deserve
‘Cause I deserve better
And you say you never need me
Yeah you say you’re gonna leave me
Well I’d like to see, you try to be
‘Cause I ain’t gonna let you go
Moving on, gotta take control
Staying strong, but it’s taking hold
Can’t go back, never going back,back,back

[Chorus]
I want you and no one else
I want you for myself
I want you, and nothing else will do
No one acting confused
I’ve got nothing to lose
I want you, and if I can’t have you
Then no one will

[Verse 2]
So when you think about me
I know you think about me
Does it scare you that, I know everything
And I won’t keep quiet
You got the key to my heart yeah
I got the key to your apartment
Would you let me in, or I’m breaking in
‘Cause I ain’t gonna let you go
Moving on, gotta take control
Staying strong, it’s taking hold
Can’t go back, never going back, back, back

[Chorus]
I want you and no one else
I want you for myself
I want you, and nothing else will do
No one acting confused
I’ve got nothing to lose
I want you, and if I can’t have you
Then no one will

Oh if I see you with someone else
I would lose my head
If I had your love for myself
Don't know what I'd do

I want you and no one else
I want you for myself
I want you and nothing else will do
I'll never let you go (na-na-na-na-na)
Hey (na-na-na-na-na)
I'll never let you go (na-na-na-na-na)
Woah (na-na-na-na-na)
I'll never let you go (na-na-na-na-na)
Hey (na-na-na-na-na)
I'll never let you go (na-na-na-na-na)
Ahhhh

I want you and no one else
I want you for myself
I want you and nothing else will do
No one acting confused
I've got nothing to lose
I want you and if I can't have you
(If I can't have you)
Oh if I see you with someone else (Someone else, someone else)
I would lose my head
If I had your love for myself
Don't know what I'd do (don't know what I'd do)
I want you and no one else
I want you for myself
I want you and nothing else will do
And nothing else but you
