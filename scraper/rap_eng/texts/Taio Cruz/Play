Oh they don't understand
That I just wanna dance
That I just wanna dance
I just, I just wanna dance
And they don't even know
That i'm about to blow
Yeah i'm about to blow
I'mma, I'mma bout to blow

And I just wanna hit the club
And drop it to the floor
And when they think I've had enough
Then i'mma give them more
We rock it through the night
And then we rock it through the day

The only button we know
How to press is play
I wanna show it
So i'mma keep it going
Play
Don't stop the music
DJ just keep it moving
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Play
Don't stop the music
DJ just keep it moving

If you ain't from the play
Get up out of my way
Get up out of my way
Ge-Get up out of my way
Cause I'm about to mosh
Do it just like a boss
Do it just like a boss
Do-do it just like a boss

And I just wanna hit the club
And drop it to the floor
And when they think I've had enough
Then i'mma give them more
We rock it through the night
And then we rock it through the day

The only button we know
How to press is play
I wanna show it
Play
Don't stop the music
DJ just keep it moving
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Play
Don't stop the music
DJ just keep it moving

And I just wanna hit the club
And drop it to the floor
And when they think I've had enough
Then i'mma give them more
We rock it through the night
And then we rock it through the day

The only button we know
How to press......Play

I wanna show it
So i'mma keep it going
Play
Don't stop the music
DJ just keep it moving
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Play
Don't stop the music
DJ just keep it moving
