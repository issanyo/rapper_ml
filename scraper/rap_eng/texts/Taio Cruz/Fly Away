We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh

Some where far some place where no one else can go
Some place where only you and I know how to get there
Some place where only doves have seen the skies
Some place where only you and I know how to get there

And we can touch the sky
Together we can find a way
We can make it there
And no one will stand in our way
We can even go where nobody knows
Where only you and I...

We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh

A place in the sun, a place that's further than the stars
A place where only you and I know how to get there
It's not as far as Jupiter but further than Mars
A place where only you and I know how to get there

And we can touch the sky
Together we can find our way
We can make it there
And no one will stand in our way
We can even go where nobody knows
Where only you and I...

We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh

We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
