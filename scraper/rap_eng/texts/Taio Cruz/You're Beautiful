I think the stars are especially bright tonight
And I love the way they shine
Reflecting inside your eyes
It's you and me forever
That's what I know for sure
My heart is here for you
Just like an open door

I can't say in any better way
Hard to explain
What you mean to me

You're beautiful

And I can't find
Any better line
For design
Any better sing for
You're beautiful

I feel the sun
He's especially warm today
Well I guess you may
I guess the rain, go and come back another day

You know I love your smile
But that's all I need for me
And living my life with you
It's just like a fantasy

I can't say in any better way
Hard to explain
What you mean to me

You're beautiful

And I can't find
Any better line
For design
Any better sing for
You're beautiful

I can't say in any better way
Hard to explain
What you mean to me

You're beautiful
