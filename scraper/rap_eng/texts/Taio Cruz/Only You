One moment, one moment ago, I left, I left the road
And got lost with no map to find but just stop
And it got me right back home to where you are
To the place I need, to the place I started
Where I come home, the place I belong with you

And when I'm lost it's you I turn to
And when the line is crossed it's you I turn to
Only you, only you, only you, only you
And when I'm lost it's you I turn to
Only you

I walked, I walked the road for so long, for so long alone
Until I found one ray of light I need
And it got me right back home to where you are
To the place I need, to the place I started
Where I come home, the place I belong with you

And when I'm lost it's you I turn to
And when the line is crossed it's you I turn to
Only you, only you, only you, only you
And when I'm lost it's you I turn to
Only you, only you

When you are near the way is clear
You show me who I am

And when I'm lost it's you I turn to
And when the line is crossed it's you I turn to
Only you, only you, only you, only you
And when I'm lost it's you I turn to
Only you

One moment, one moment ago I left, I left the road
