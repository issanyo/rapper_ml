Been spendin' time alone
Last night when I touched your hand
You didn't wanna hold
Today no kiss goodbye

Something you wanna say
Please don't, don't hold it back
It'll come out someday
I am I'm strong enough
To mend my broken heart
(Oh yeah)

Are betta off apart
If you're leavin' me, baby

If you're done with me, baby
