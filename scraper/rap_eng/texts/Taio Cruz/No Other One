Look, I don't need change but you know what that's funny
Can't you see the time, who's got money?
Money, cash out, leave with my tip
On a ten dollar meal, no change on my hunny

Rokstarr shades and you looking so stunning
Stunning, that's how it looks when we be hand in hand
And walking the streets when nobody else can match our flavor
How could you think I was ever gonna change ya
I ain't never gonna change ya

I don't need to ever exchange
(You know I)
I don't need to ever replace
(You know I)

I'm not going any damn place
(You know I)
You should know that I, I, I
(Oh, I)

I know no other one, I know no other one, I know, oh
I know no other one, I know no other one, all I need is you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
All I need is you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

I know no other one, I know no other one, I know, oh
I know no other one, I know no other one, all I need is you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
All I need is you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
All I need is you
