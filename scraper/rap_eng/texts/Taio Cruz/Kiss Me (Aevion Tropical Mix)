[Verse 1]
I want to love you, give you that loving, baby
Take it high with you, do what you like, baby
I got to find out, how you can be my lady
'Cause I got to do things, do things to drive you crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
We got one chance and I want it badly
Do you feel like it’s going the right way?
Do you know what you're doing inside me?
If you want that then bring that fire, baby
Yeah, you got me, I'm dreaming about it
If you like that then we can go ’round it
If you need that then tell me right now
Baby, 'cause I wanna know

[Chorus]
If this is the last night
Baby, let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it
If this is the last night
Baby, let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it
Kiss me like you mean it
If this is the last night
Baby, let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it

[Pre-Chorus]
We got one chance and I want it badly
Do you feel like it's going the right way?
Do you know what you're doing inside me?
If you want that then bring that fire, baby
Yeah, you got me, I'm dreaming about it
If you like that then we can go ’round it
If you need that then tell me right now
Baby, ’cause I wanna know

[Chorus]
If this is the last night
Baby, let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it
If this is the last night
Baby, let’s do this right, kiss me like you mean it

[Bridge]
Oh, kiss me, oh, hold on me
Let's go to a place, we'll never be lonely
Oh, I need you, I need you to hold me
Oh, kiss me like you mean it
Kiss me like you mean it
Kiss me like you mean it
Kiss me like you mean it

[Chorus]
If this is the last night
Baby, let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it
