[Verse 1: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
Now I know how to get down on the floor (floor)
Experienced in moves you can't ignore (ignore)
But something 'bout this beat that's got me hooked (hooked)
Come over here and take a closer look (look)

[Bridge: Kylie Minogue & Taio Cruz]
Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Woah, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me down

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher of the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher of the ground

[Verse 2: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
I do this just for kicks, just for the thrill, thrill
I got this high without taking a pill, (pill)
This groove has got me way over the sun, sun
I'm dancing like I am the only one, (one)

[Bridge: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground, woah
I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now

[Chorus: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher of the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher of the ground

[Verse 4: Travie McCoy]
I got my feet in the air
And my head on the ground
And the rest of my body
Is somewhere in the clouds
I'm coming down no time soon
Like I'm tied to a couple hundred helium balloons
Looks like I'm a be up for a minute (Uh huh)
Such a beautiful feeling, idn't it? (Yup)
When your body is so plateau
On a level that
Just feels so infinite

[Bridge: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
The music's got
Me going higher
I feel like
I can touch the sky

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher of the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher of the ground
[Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher of the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher of the ground

[Ending: Travie McCoy]
It's your boy Travie McCoy!
Taio Cruz!
