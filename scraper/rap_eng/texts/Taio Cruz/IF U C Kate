[Verse 1]
First time I saw her she was standing in line
Holding a book about compatible signs
I should have talked to her, I should have tried
But I was breathless by the look in her eye
She introduced herself as Kate and I replied
"It's nice to meet you," it was love at first sight
I got excited, I lost my mind
I lost the number that read "Let's have a good time", so

[Chorus]
If you see Kate
Tell her that I'm looking for her
She's so fine
That girl's been on my mind

[Verse 2]
I saw her friend that was in line that day
And had to tell her how I felt about Kate
She said, "Put her out your mind or stand in line
I've seen her do this to men a thousand times"
She had a rep for spreading all her love around
And everywhere she went Kate drew a crowd
"Don't bother me," that's what I said
'Cause I can't seem to get that girl out of my head, so

[Chorus]
If you see Kate
Tell her that I'm looking for her
She's so fine
That girl's been on my mind
If you see Kate
Tell her that I'm asking 'bout her
She's so fine
And she's been on my mind

[Bridge]
(If you see Kate
Tell her I'm looking for her)
Girl, you're a star, shining like the sun
Whisper in my ear, you broaden my horizons
Stay with me and let's make it the longest day
Pour yourself into my mouth, I love the way you taste
Pull you in tight, it feels so right
Girl, I just wanna be the one
To take you to heaven tonight

[Chorus]
Come on, baby
Tell her that I'm asking about her
She's so fine
And she's been on my mind
If you see Kate
Tell her that I'm looking for her
She's so fine
That girl's been on my mind
