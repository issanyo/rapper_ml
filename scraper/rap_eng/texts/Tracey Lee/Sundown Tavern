There's a place downtown where my man hangs around
Drinking and a winking
And a playing around
Sundown tavern
You're a sorrow bound
I'm getting ready to burn you down

Sundown tavern
Now you're to blame
You have brought my man to shame
Sundown tavern
Won't be the same
I'm ready and waitin' to set you a flame

Sundown, sundown
You've been keeping my man broke
Sundown, sundown
Sundown tavern
You'll go up in smoke
Sundown tavern
Now you're a disgrace
Satan's den for the human race

Sundown tavern's
Where my man stays
You're goin' up with a mighty big blaze
Sundown tavern
Now you've got what's mine
You've wrapped his brain with your bubbling wine

The torch I've carried is in my hand
And now you're ready for the promised land
Sundown, sundown
I'm gonna watch you hit the ground

Sundown, sundown
Sundown tavern
I'm a burnin' you down

Sundown, sundown
I'm gonna watch you hit the ground
Sundown, sundown
Sundown tavern
I've burnt you down
