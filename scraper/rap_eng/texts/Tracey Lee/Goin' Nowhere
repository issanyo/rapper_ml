Artist: Changing Faces f/ Tracey Lee
Album:  All Day, All Night
Song:   Goin' Nowhere

[Changing Faces]
Chillin' at home thinking about what we gon' do
What are we in this for
Cuz we ain't in love no more, no more
Wasting my time trying to fill up yo' appetite
Well I'm hungry now and it ain't for you tonight

1 -     This is going nowhere (this is going nowhere)
Nothing left for us to share
(there's nothing left for us to share)
This is going nowhere, nowhere, nowhere

Come on inside cuz I really need to talk to you
I won't bite my tongue cuz it's over now, It's done
We've been through this before
But no, not now, no more
I just won't sacrifice, I've only got one life

Repeat 1

[Tracey Lee]
It's Tracey Lee baby
Talk to me (huh? what? huh? yeah)
You acting outright high, what, huh?
Casandra what chu mean by dat
I see Charisse been in yo' ear but
When it seems like dat
I got to compete wit yo "X" too
I blessed you
Don't come with the excuse that you like
Creaming is it true dat
So I want chu to move back
Since you don't wanna do dat
It will be the same case
When you proceed to Change Faces
And you know how you do, boo
I gotten used to
Your mood swings now grab yo' things, yeah
You left your set of keys to the BM here
You ain't goin' nowhere
You know my style
We were late, I made it hot like the Mohave
Stay late in the studio so now we
Can lounge in his and her Lex Jeeps
Plush livin'
The crib book valued at one point three
Don't get twisted though
I don't need residuals to make sure
It's more visual then Sony
That you're my one and only
But slowly I see
And Dushe told me you might loose interest
But you better be sure before we
End this
What is this
It's Tre baby, Talk to me

Repeat 1
