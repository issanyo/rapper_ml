[Phone Rings]

Tray Lee:Hold On, Hold On... Wait a minute
Yeah, Yeah, What's happenin'?

Phone:Tray yo, what's up? how's it going Tray?
ByStorm business
Tell yo honey to go and listen

Out on the industry
You know my fee. Wit a ten percent bonus
If the job is complete within one day

[Tray's woman complains]

Verse One:

TL:My niggas, check this shit out, I just got off the phone
Wit Goose, he want the crew to put a hit out

Reepz:On who?

TL:The industry and yo, it sounds legit, equipped, wit
Infra-red and twenty mil to split. But first we need
A game plan that fits, ski masks, Tecs nigga wit
Unlimited clips. Bulletproof vests, no let ups, lets
Rock son undebted, so boys I'll be the decoy, the
First one to set it

Reepz 1:Since Tray's the first one to set it, he can
Walk past the guards unprotected, set up
Shop, for the rest of us to wreck shit
Meanwhile, I'll lace the basement with
Basement placement of explosives. I see
Four guards where the entourage started
Just pinpoint the target, so we can get
Started

Reepz 2:Yo nigga, I'm all for it, map it, we can score
It, I need three guns, and a soldier to stand
By the door wit. No bullshit, I loaded up my
Lyrics and two shotties in the barn from pop
Taped to my body. I'm bustin' shots like it
Don't make sense, gettin' rid of all witnesses
And evidence

Reepz 3:I'm bout to shut it down, I need a round and a
Card, change of gear, arsenal status, the Ramada
Forties, fakes, takin' up space, reals get nada
Time to make it sicker than Italian Jim Carter

So the operation starts in eighteen hundred hours

TL:Let's set it off and put the plan into effect
Made a call and said, I begin to think wit all the
Bosses. While I got this guys occupied, Borne
Run up in they office
The four RNF files and shit like that, and take
Anything that says they got us under contract
Since niggas are wired, this how it go, when you
Hear me make a move to leave the room, then
That's the signal

R1:Now that we have the instructions, and the
Blueprints have been structured, it's time to do it
AV, chick, you set bombs, to defuse it, if they
Got confused wit, the plan just use it. Take no
Prisoners, give no remorse. Tray Lee kissed his
Cross and was off

TL:Good lookin' out

R2:Yeah, no doubt, let's keep it movin', they heard
The shots comin' in, pullin' out. Let's sweat
The scene like Colin Ferguson, I got the
Documents, but if this nigga's dead, why the
Fuck I'm hearin' shots?

Bullets sprayed I caught one in the shoulder
Blade. I cocked the shot, he pulled the trigger

Bullet, that travels into ya

If I'm slowin' up, don't stop see, y'all niggas
Jet without me

R1:Look what this shit created, we almost out
Barely makin' it, bullets sprayed straight
Through Tray's leg, almost amputated it
Me and Fee was hit, half empty clips with
Intent to kill, and until the end, so we ain't
Tryin' to quit, but stakes is high, so yo pie
Get us outta this

WT:Yo, it's obvious, hey I'm tired of this shit
