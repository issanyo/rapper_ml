[Verse 1: Prodigy & Tracey Lee]
Big stacks (Hey, yeah), 100 racks (Hey, yeah)
Bad chick (Hey, yeah), I get that (Hey)
Them girls'll make you dance all night
Making the movie for the ’gram tonight
Jacuzzi bubbles in the tub tonight
Spilling D'USSÉ on your body, you'll like
Big stacks, hold up (Hey, yeah)
100 racks, hold up (Hey, yeah)
Bad chick (Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I already get that, yeah

[Hook: Tracey Lee & Prodigy]
I do what I wanna do, do what I wanna do
There’s greatness in front of you, lyrically punish you
Mentally, physically, spiritually, yes, my life is so wonderful
Life is so wonderful (Cos' I do what I wanna do)
Do what I wanna do, do what I wanna do
I do what I wanna do, do what I, do what I wanna do
I do what I wanna do, do what I wanna do
I do what I wanna do (Cos' I do what I wanna do)

[Verse 2: Tracey Lee]

Bottles, the model, the paper, the haters
You name it, it's nothing new
Heard your new joint, its like, nah, yeah
I stay in law in booth with the truth

[Hook: Tracey Lee & Prodigy]
I do what I wanna do, do what I wanna do
There's greatness in front of you, lyrically punish you
Mentally, physically, spiritually, yes, my life is so wonderful
Life is so wonderful (Cos' I do what I wanna do)
Do what I wanna do, do what I wanna do
I do what I wanna do, do what I, do what I wanna do
I do what I wanna do, do what I wanna do
