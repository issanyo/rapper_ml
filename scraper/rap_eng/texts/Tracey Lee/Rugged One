[Verse 1]
I believe it's the LR
Who freaks the funk and won't you won't see son
A lyrical beast from the dungeons
Caught up in my physical, I flows like cash, meter
Head turner, burn MC's like mash
Leaving the east done like [?]
The west won the zoo
Left niggas swinging like Ken Griffey Ju'
Dubbed The Future
Never too much friction
When I begin to spilling the gospel like commission
Saints are rising up feeling the vibe from my sermon
It's L I rock well, Parley keeps turning
The 12 so MC's get the finger
Roll over niggas like George Gerving
Damn it don't make me bring the
Fleet full cause we pulling the whole weight jack
It don't stop y'all
I'm starting to rock like crack
Shit is hot word to God I got 'em scoping my steel
For real cause I get niggas open
Here comes the rugged

[Hook] {x2}
Here comes the rugged one
Here comes the rugged one bust the way I flip it
Here comes the rugged one
The rhyme is rugged at the same time sharp

[Verse 2]
So nigga feel my wrath, get caught up in the rapture
That ill funk from Philly I be rhyming
From Tasker to Diamond
From Wooland Avenue to Nice Town ock I watch
Nigga that I know and from the whole block flock
To see the L, I maintain
In Max's I'm running more game than March Madness
When I bag chicks so just do that
Don't even try to play too close
I got juice like the Gootch at different stroke kid I smoke mics
So hold tight
I'm about to set it
Yes y'all, collect presidents when I get off like Prince
I lost niggas
When I bust like angel eyed dust
Ass niggas, I'm calling your bluff it's the rugged
One with the rep I
Amaze when I blaze like Left Eye
Got lyrics for days kid so check my
Forth, forth and back, back and forth I flow
So let me see you, let me see you go

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Well I be god damn I rain man like Shawn Kemp, it's the bomb shit
Dig it when I get's down
I make that ass Bob like Brown
Ready for prime time baby
So fill up the Dutch with lye
And watch niggas get split up like Guy
MC's I turn your lights out on some World Class shit
Wreck Cru's/crews like James Tony when I get loose
You know me
It's R.N.F. see
So please duck when I spark freeze
Or many MC's get Bucked like Milwaukee
I Kool with my Gang and Celebrate with O.E
Shit is too hot so niggas know not
I blow the mic up
Then I light up more Knicks than Reggie Miller see
When I puff the kill black then my lyrics get Ill like Al Skratch
Catch 22's of brews when I be chilling like gears
So what it is ock?
It's R.N.F. to death, hang with on top
It's like that and it don't stop
Keep on to the break yo
This Philly motherfuck gonna blow up from state to state so

[Hook]
