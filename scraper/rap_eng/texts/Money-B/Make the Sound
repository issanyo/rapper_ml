[Verse One: Money B]
Yeah I burn MC's to resemblance of incense
Mon' B step on the flo' and leave imprints
For instance, I run through tracks like wind sprints
Preme know, I'm from the O, homie we been pimps
It ain't nothin' to get your wig torn off
Get mo' head and tail than a coin toss
Ooh I'm boss
What's it gon' cost? Tell me yes or no
If you with it like you sitting in the exit row
Now I got the lil' sexy ho
She like to go way down south
She call my dick "Mexico"
Cause it got an effervescent flow
You can Check The Rhime like Tribe Called Quest negro
I'm like Joe Pescopo on a Saturday Night
I'm a dog but the best in show
And you ain't Lisa Leslie ho
No, you can't sco' on Mon' B/Knoxx/'Fest/Primo
So...

[Verse Two: Rhymefest]
Niggas don't know what the fuck niggas want
(Niggas want revolution!) Man, nah niggas don't
Niggas want war, niggas want weed, niggas want to drink
Niggas won't leave, niggas won't think
I love my people but due to nigga venom
I gotta be like Blade and kill the nigga in 'em
One shot of this dick is just like penicillin
And when I rock the bed, the bitches hit the ceiling
Nigga, you better take some E
My niggas finna take the lead
Like Dwyane Wade, my nigga finna take the league
It ain't shit you can take from me
Nigga
Primo
Rhymefest
Money B
Scott Knoxx
Fuck underground we the niggas under the stairs
You got hyphy music
You got crunk music
Bounce like motherfucker, this the gun movement
Bloaw!

[Verse Three: Scott Knoxx]
This a world premier, Knoxx and Premier
We get the crowd moving like there's Glocks in the air
As far as birds go, I got flocks in the air
Me and Mon' Get Around like 'Pac's in here
Knoxx is key love Milwaukee's metropolis
Sending niggas like Webster, call me Popadopoulos
The name is Scott Knoxx, please don't start knocking this
Unless you in the whip then please start knocking this
Like the cops I make love and they cock blocking this
All in shawty ear trying to see what my options is
The boat, the bar, the throat, the broad
And I'm one of a kind, it's so bizarre
And they can't believe, I just talk to 'em anyway
Turned on by my charm, they walk to 'em anyway
So I weigh my odds and play my cards
A boss of this game, I just play my part
Bitch
