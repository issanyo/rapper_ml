45 bands in the kitchen, tell them boi’s I’m whippin
Got a pink slip when the car not dippin
She really out here dissin
When she’s one that she’s really missin
I don’t like to see her piss
Niggas pulled up the block
I’m leveling up the stock
Half of y’all niggas have never been locked up
45 bands in the kitchen, tell them boi’s I’m whippin
Got a pink slip when the car not dippin
She really out here dissin
When she’s one that she’s really miss
I don’t like to see her piss
Niggas pulled up the block
I’m leveling up the stock
Half of y’all niggas have never been locked up

[ Money B Verse ]
Yea, I’m a boss up
Have yo hoe on locked up
Better watch what you talkin before my nigga come spray yea
From the 305 when the women lie and cheat
Come me, Money B

Got the hoes on locked down like they know where to meet
In the Benz, give me brain, make amends
It’s insane, fuck that nigga till the end, yea
Fuck that nigga till the end

[ NanooKidd Verse ]
Nanoo coming with the beat
Nigga dropping the heat
Y’all don’t even like to treat
Young niggas in the streets trying to eat, aye
Y’all don’t fuck with me
Y’all don’t like it when Nanoo coming next
Telling them bitches that you running X
Don’t like to text
Bitches know who to flex
Never sitting back on desk
Hanging out with Towelie, smoking weed
Got the stuff we need
Pulling up at the trap, busting raps
Y’all niggas ain’t even clap, aye
I don’t like it when you coming
Y’all nigga ain’t funny
Bitches know you running
You females ain’t stunning, aye
