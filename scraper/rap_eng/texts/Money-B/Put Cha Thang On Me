(Numskull, Money B & Clee)
Is this my party or yours, my time or yours
My drank or yours, my place or yours
Can you drive? Naw, I'll drive
I don't lie, you lie
I even tell the truth when I lie
Now gimme some head, cause its the last time
You'll ever see a nigga like me
I'm on some fuckin and flee
You only hate cause you lovin to eat
You heard 2Pac tape, and now you thuggin wit three
Bankrupt, hoodrats, and now they lovin some me

(Money B)
Say bitch do me a favor
Go get your boy a bat, and two shots of yay (alright)
I'm thinkin you my flava, I'm bout to put you on my hip
Let you vibrate my shit like a pager
That ass is lookin major
Do you fuck on the first date?
Well lets skate like Armor Yaga
They say the best pussy is new pussy
You even true pussy
I turned you into crew pussy

(Clee)
Now look at this bitch, she bout a eight or a nine
But a eight next to Clee, gon make her a dime
I just met the bitch, and she want me to make her mine
But I'm like bitch, grab a ticket, get a number, wait in line
And haters find me to be they worst nightmare
Cause I have they bitch cleanin house in they nightware
They be like, where in the fuck is my bitch at?
She proably blowin me back, while she blowin ya scratch

(Chorus)
Put Cha thang on me
I'm tryna drink, fuck, nut and get up
You got your name on me
I see you lookin right, but what yo cash lookin like
Put cha thang on me
You say you wanna make it hot, well lets shake the spot
You got your name on me
Bitch we ain't trippin on ya
We from Oakland, California!

(Money B)
I'm drinkin hard liqour, the results come quicker
I got scratch bitch wikka wikka
I'm sick of you bousy hoes
I be fuckin wit them hoodrats and ????(make a bitch bust a nudey pose)
Fuck that, you got the plush cat, whats that?
Bend over, and lemme touch that(whats that?)
A freckled face nutstasche
Make em take they knee like a touchback
And grab a hold to my nutsack, and lemme bust that

(Numskull)
I'm proably the dopest nigga that the earth ever made
I'm fine, I'm long, got game, and I'm paid
Nigga I can pull a bitch in a mail man suit
Leavin checks to checks, scopin in my steel toe boots
Now, watch what I tell ya, i'ma pull Lil Kim
Cause she done got some shit fixed
Now she holdin her ten
From here, its fair game, fuckin everybodys bitch
Payroll on mine, I ain't turnin down shit

(Clee)
Well heres a little somethin about a nigga like Clee
Nigga been a playa since elementary
And I'ma stay a playa till the next century
Got the ???sayin, wow bitch its Clee
Let a bitch hit to me, I'm the one she wanna leave wit
I'ma have that bitch, playboy, please believe it
We run game on em, then we run trains on em
Its even to the point when they put our names on em

(Chorus)
