Well, we're the freaks of the industry
My man, Money B, Oh my mellow, Shock G
The freaks of the industry
And when you see us back stage, be prepared to G

Well they say that birds do it, bees do it. [do it]
Time to freak, Money B gets to it
Not a heavyweight, but I go twelve rounds
With a jab and a stick, I'm goin' lick for lick, so
Give me the helmet, I'll be the stunt man
Just relax, and I won't front
Like Anita, I'm givin' you the best that I've got
And I'll be takin' it slow, never missin' a spot
Yes, caressing your back we're chest to chest she's kissing on my freckles
I nibbled around your ears before I suck upon your neck
'Oh Money B,' yeah, that's what you'll be screamin' and creamin'
But it's not a wet dream, it's the real
The freaky dog, dark nasty, never lettin' a kitty-cat get past me
Without picking it up, pettin' it, teasin' it
Takin' it on home and pleasin' it

Cause we're the freaks of the industry
You's a freak Money B. You got that Shock G
The freaks of the industry
And when you see us back stage, be prepared to G

Say you're G'in' [G'in'?]
Nobody else is seein'
And the freak that you're wit' is in front of you
Bendin' over naked, and she's leanin' on the dresser [Ooh yeah]
You're lookin' at her from the rear [Yeah]
She looks just like Vanessa [The right stuff]
Uh uh, not Vanessa with the singer career
But the X-rated video queen
Know what I mean? [Uh huh] A'ight, here's the scene:
You're lying on you're back with your head on the edge of the bed
The booty's two feet from your head:
Should you: A, take the time to find a condom
B, you walk right over and you pound 'em
C, tell her that you want her love
Well the answer is D, [D], all of the above
So you're freakin' [freakin'], the furniture's squeakin' [squeakin']
She's tweakin', sayin' that she's weak in the knees
Cheek to cheek, and pound for pound
You're taxin' it and waxin' it and workin' it around
'Til the booty starts makin' that clappin' sound
Which is cool, but your friends are chillin' in the other room
The clappin's getting louder, you don't want them to clown you
In this situation, what do you do: [What?]
A, you, plain and simply, back up off her
B, you hit it just a little bit softer
C, you take it out and put it in het butt
Well, D is what I do, so, yo, listen up:
I put a towel on the floor by the two inch gap under the door
Now they can't see me any more
Check the locks so they can't clock, but they can listen
There'll be no bargin' in and there'll be no dissin' [Dissin']
Gettin' back to my mission, break out the whipped cream and the cherries
Then I go through all the fly positions:
My head under her leg under my arm under her toe
She says, 'I like it when you scream, baby let yourself go.'
I hit it and split it, lick it and quit it
After the ride, put my clothes on and walk outside
And before anybody gets a chance to speak
I say, 'Yo, don't say nuttin', I guess I'm just a freak!'

Cause we're the freaks of the industry
Aw, you's a freak, G. Yo, you worse Money B
The freaks of the industry
And when you see us backstage, be prepared to G

[You know what man, you's a freak
I seen you with that girl at the hotel after
That show last week
And what about that time out there in the park?
Shhh, don't tell nobody]

It's like this:
Now if there's a cure for this
We don't want it, we'll run from it
And if there's a remedy
We don't need it, we just eat it

[This is to the ladies: I'm a freak
Hey, yo, piano man: take us out of here, man]
