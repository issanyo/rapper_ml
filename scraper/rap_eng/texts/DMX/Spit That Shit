[Hook x2]
I'ma spit that shit
Show these niggas how dark this shit get
Cause I'ma spit that shit
Show these niggas how dark this shit get

[Verse 1]
Shit pop off, we don't blow it up 'til we blow it up
Cats better slow it up, y'all niggas know what's up
My niggas throw it up; we all know that
In fact, niggas missing the action, where are they at?
See, you niggas never really been ducked out
But got enough mouth to get snuffed out; roof the rough route
We don't play around here, nigga, we're grown
Start applying pressure, give the dog a bone
I'm taking half; it's just that simple
Or I can start popping niggas like pimples
I'ma let you call it, you ballin'
'Til you get hit with them hot things, now you're staggering and fallin'
I'm holding up the wall, you got more than enough problems in the floor
You're just wasting a nigga's time; come on, man
I got shit to do, like hit your crew
Might hit your crib, so what that bitch gon' do
Not a damn thing, but dawg's with the program
Beast on that bitch like Conan, whoa man
I'ma go where no man has ever gone
Nigga, when it's on, it's on, I'll let you know when the fuck it's on
I got nothing to hide, but you got a reason to run
Come through like BRRAT, to the squeeze of the gun
And that's just squeezing one, imagine if we all let go
And turn your whole block into a death row

[Hook x2]

Between me and you, I'd be in the dark for too long
Bark is too strong, hot light is on
Whatever it's gon' be, that's what it is
I didn't stutter, motherfucka, put that on your kids
Built for war, built for raw
Built for more, built from it all for the dog to the floor
I've been getting down before I knew what getting down was
Shit, I just do what a real nigga does
Get anything straight up
If shit starts falling apart, wait up, let's get this rent paid up
So it's square one, and a nigga can't get a fair one at
Any time of the day, but a nigga can run
Keep shit moving, doing what the fuck we be doin'
They're coming to 'em, but I'm running through 'em
I don't need the headache, I've never been talking to death
But I'll fuck you to death; what the fuck you left?
I don't want nothing, but some fucking pussy
I ain't trying to be all cuddled up, [?] talking getting mushy
Been there, done that, with that one back there
From when there was none of that to when there was some of that
Niggas still come back, hood for life
Shit, quiet as a cat nigga, where's my wife?
[?] for the night, that's what it be
Or if its good for tomorrow cause tomorrow well see
Take it one day at a time, my end's in the street
Don't fear my feast, your man's in the heat
That's how the dog gets down on all fours
After a certain hour, I'm knocking on all doors
Anything goes when it's on, motherfucka
Whether you're friend or foe, you gon' lend some dough
And in case you don't know, that nigga don't owe
Whatever I come up on, let that shit go
Faggot
