[Verse 1: DMX]
Dudes is funny, look at who you move with money
Yous a dummy, don't make me lose it sonny
I stay on some bull, extra shit
Whichever ya mans you next to, you next to a bitch
Whatever type of gat you got, mine bigger
You think what you want cause I'm that nigga
Can't pull it off unless you hit all the way
I get it down for real, get it all day
Come on, hey
That's what you get down like
Now I know, swear that's what a nigga sound like
We get down like the rest of them cats
And what does it really mean to be the best of them cats
Sometimes I see but I really didn't want to
Be careful what you do cause it'll come back to haunt you
Real recognize real
But it isn't just birdman boy, it's (?)

[Verse 2: Big Moeses]
Hot than a motherfucker, caliente
I'm a real nigga so I keep a wet K
Bricks on deck, keep an esse
Bloodline couldn't see me on your best day
Banana in the clip, let the tec spray
Menace to society, oh dawg walk up
Poke your head and then I roll up
Gotta keep it gangster, that's 500
I'm still spendin' this old money
I took the tubes off, put the Vogues on it
Lethal weapon like Mel Gibson, man I stay stuntin'
(?) and you stay frontin'
Check my pedigree I bet it add up
I'm (?) like a Mack truck
Big Moeses get the stacks up
Sleepin' (?) that's how you got passed up

[Bridge]
Just cause I love my niggas
I shed my blood for my niggas
Holla where my niggas
I'm right here my niggas
Just cause I love my niggas
I shed my blood for my niggas
Holla where my niggas
I'm right here my niggas

[Verse 3: Joe Young]
When the beat come on it get darker every time
Spit venomous tales about this life of crime
I come through buzzin' leave a critical mess
How you talk tough wearin' a dress
I wake up stressed amongst the best on the track with a dog
When I bite my teeth sink
But how you gon' see a nigga livin' in the fog
I dealt with rats and rattlesnakes
I battle with hate
The Lord is great, survive the maze
Rebuke the devil in ongoing debates
I try to be cool and try to show love
At the same time I want Trump on his back with his face blown off

[Bridge]
Just cause I love my niggas
I shed my blood for my niggas
Holla where my niggas
I'm right here my niggas
Just cause I love my niggas
I shed my blood for my niggas
Holla where my niggas
I'm right here my niggas
