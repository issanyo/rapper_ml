[Intro: DMX]
There we go, okay, okay
Don't do me greasy
You know what a dog needs?
Do you really know what a dog needs?
A dog needs a bitch (What? What?)
A dog needs a bitch (Come on!)
Not just any bitch, but a real bitch
That's gon' hold that dog down

[Verse 1: DMX]
Baby, I am what I am, I'm gon' be who I be
Everything from chasing a cat to pissing on a tree
Let me see what I gotta to see
Do what I gotta to do, dog for life, but keep it true
Every once in a while I'll break out the backyard to roam
And get reckless, but I still know that home is home
And when I get there I'ma sit there
Take a shit there, put my dick there
Do I handle my business? Shit yeah
I'ma run 'til I bust my gun and empty the clip
Then when I come home, and gotta go, just give me the whip
I ain't got time for the lip, just open the fence
Let me go, I'll come back, I ain't got time to convince
Ever since I was a pup I've been stuck with the street shit
Keep the heat shit, fuck it, nigga gotta eat shit
I pass on a weak shit, if it's out there I want it
All at one time, so when it's my time I've done it

[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
I know you'd kill for me, you'd die you me
I know you like to rip and run the streets
But I get nervous sometimes, baby, I can't help to think
You might not make it home to eat, I barely sleep
Could you pick up a phone and call me at home
And let me know you ain't in some heat?
And don't go crying, you're grown
You know I'm looking out for you
‘Cause you be looking out for me, me, me

[Hook: Aaliyah]
Yo you can go with your dogs
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
So you can go with your dogs
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
'Fore you go bending the law
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
I know you up in it all, if you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece

[Bridge: Aaliyah]
And, oh boy, I know you got to do what you do
You're making moves
I'm making moves, yo, we cool
Lay on your paws, I got your back if you fall
Nothing's too big
Nothing's too small, just go ball

[Verse 3: DMX]
Dog tags around my neck, the streets are mine
I might leave the heat behind
‘Cause in the streets I'm fine
That's why a nigga sleep 'til nine, out by ten
Back by ten, sleep 'til nine, do it again
If you love something, let it go
If it comes back to you it yours
If it doesn't, fuck it, you never know
You got me, I got you, dog with a dog
Ride 'til we die, if it's on then it's on

[Hook: Aaliyah]
Yo you can go with your dogs
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
So you can go with your dogs
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
'Fore you go bending the law
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
I know you up in it all, if you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
