[Intro: DMX]
Love my niggas, but where's my bitches?
I love my niggas, but where's my bitches?
Love my niggas, but where's my bitches?
I love my niggas, but where's my bitches?

[Chorus: DMX]
It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches

[Verse 1: DMX]
Yo, chickens is good for pluckin', so I'm stickin' bitches, fuckin'
Got 'em trickin' while they suckin', give em dick and they be buggin'
I've done it all - from mackin two hoes on a three-way
Dominican hoes on B-way, country hoes in V-A
And they all say the same about my game it's tight
That's why every night a different group of bitches start a fight
Over some dick that they don't even own
All I'm givin' them is the bone
Blowin' up a niggas phone, but ain't nobody home (damn)
I'm in the zone, tryna do things
Let's turn this into a crew thing -- whassup girlfriend, you game?
Don't wonder why when I leave at night
It's because I thieve at night
I'm leavin' bitches not breathin' right
I fuck they head up with some slick shit
Hit 'em off with some long dick shit
Make it some quick shit, but rip shit
Then I'm out, just like the trash on a Thursday
Knowin' she'd be givin' up the ass on the first date

[Chorus: DMX]
It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches
It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches

[Verse 2: DMX]
Flocks of bitches by the dozens, from sisters to cousins
Got 'em doin' shit they said they wasn't ever gonna do
Like knowin' I'd fuck the bitch that she was close to
Still gave up the ass and dough, she was supposed to (what?)
Pictures of bitches and flicks of chicks
Videos with the baddest hoes, suckin' dick
It's the dog in me, that makes me do wrong
And honeys can't help but get strung (why?)
'Cause the game is too strong (okay)
I like 'em greedy, black like Edi
Eyes beady, willin' to give to the needy
I done ran through 'em all, from around the way bitches
To them outta state hoes, and even hittin' gay bitches
All I tell 'em is, "Let me get that," then it's on
Knock her motherfuckin' boots, and then I'm gone
I got the white bitches sayin', "It's a black thing!"
'Cause I leave that ho with no dough and plenty of back pain

[Chorus: DMX]
It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches
It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches

[Verse 3: DMX]
Bitches who get props, 'cause they know who can get got
And they can get shot, by the way a niggas lip drop
Walk up in the spot, knowin' what she want strictly
When hon wants the dickly, hon comes and gets me
Hits me, pays me, doesn't get crazy
Knows to be Swayze, 'cause that's daddy's baby
I keep them hoes in check, like the government
Hittin' 'em off with nothin' but the dick, and they lovin' it!
Huggin' it, like it's they best friend, 'cause it is
Word to Miz, fuckin' with tricks is just biz
I deal with strictly dimes
Got 'em committin' they first crimes
Now she suckin' dick, for the first time
And ain't no secret, 'bout how I freak it, when they sleep
Didn't never know how I peeped it, then creeped it
That's how I know this must be that shit
I tell them bitches, "I'll be back," and they believe that shit!

[Chorus: DMX]
It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches
It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches
It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches
It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches

[Outro: DMX]
I love my niggas, but where's my bitches?
I love my niggas, but where's my bitches?
I love my niggas, but where's my bitches?
I love my niggas, but where's my bitches?
