Lay down my back I got you
I can't walk this dog without you
You won't be the same without me
Now you go whatever when it's always gonna be
You won't be the same without me
Now go whatever when it's always gonna be

Go get your stories if your dreams will come true
I got your back and I'm gonna be there for you
When this place is too much and you don't know what to do
I got your back and I'm gonna be there for you

Shorty got my back like a jacket
Hold me down when I can't hack it
Bringing the paper when she's stacking
Walking together with the ratchet
Probably gonna snatch it
Dropped the ball and she catch it
This how we do
Bonnie and Clyde nigga this how we do
She down in her ride nigga this how we do
Til a nigga die, this how we do

Go get your stories if your dreams will come true
I got your back and I'm gonna be there for you
When this place is too much and you don't know what to do
I got your back and I'm gonna be there for you

Yo I hold him down like nobody else
So when it's time thrive I'm by side you
Count on nobody else
Run up in the spot with the gamers
Who these rats in bandanas just take with them cameras
Get what we came for (come on let's get gone)
'Cause when it come to that paper 9 (we get it on)
I'm her for em 'cause I know we need that
And I'ma be by side till the day that I die, believe

Lay down my back I got you
I can't walk this dog without you
You won't be the same without me
Now you go whatever when it's always gonna be
Lay down my back I got you
I can't walk this dog without you
You won't be the same without me
Now you go whatever when it's always gonna be

Whether raise or pause, my paint is yours
Pop you come up and beat your extence to flaws
When your greener the mess we made
Roll out and live good for the rest of our days
She got me, I got her
Still get up in that pussy like grr
We don't even curve bu that's behind us
Cops looking for us, the motherfuckers find us

Go get your stories if your dreams will come true
I got your back and I'm gonna be there for you
When this place is too much and you don't know what to do
I got your back and I'm gonna be there for you

Go get your stories if your dreams will come true
I got your back and I'm gonna be there for you
When this place is too much and you don't know what to do
I got your back and I'm gonna be there for you
