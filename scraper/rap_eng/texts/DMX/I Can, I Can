Uh, Ruff Ryderz, DMX, Swizz Beatz

[Verse 1]
I be, I be that dog that gots to flow
That's why, that's why baby I gots to blow
And you, and you know it's straight from the gutter
Because, because it's gettin darker than a mother
Slow down, slow down partner you movin too quick
Oh now, oh now gotcha, your crew and them sick
What now, what now nigga, you feelin this shit?
But how, but how is this nigga killin this shit
Don't think, don't think that it couldn't happen again
Don't blink, don't blink cuz I put a (?) in your chin
Then what, then what niggas is gonna see you dead
For what, for what over some shit a bitch said
But why, but why did your life mean so liitle?
I tried, I tried but you got me caught up in the middle
This is, this is what it all comes down to
I did, I did what a nigga had to do, come on

[Hook]
Don't worry 'bout me
Cuz I'm a be the dog that I am, you know, D
The type of nigga that y'all niggas love when you see
So y'all, don't worry bout me, ya hear me?

[Verse 2]
What's up, what's up with that nigga they call D?
I am, I am what niggas is tryin to be
And will, and will continue to do my thing
They love, they love all that dark shit that I bring
Know why, know why? Cuz I keep it realer than you
You can't, you can't cuz of all the shit that you do
You know, you know just what I'm talkin about
You asked, you asked nothin bout runnin your mouth
A bitch, a bitch what you thought niggas couldn't tell?
You flipped, you flipped after two days in a cell
Good thing, good thing I knew what was on your mind
You sing, you sing but you still gon do your time
No bail, no bail cuz they don't believe your story
Oh well, oh well guess you gon do that forty
I'm here, I'm here still gettin platinum plaques
You there, you there still tryin to watch your back

[Hook] X 4
