[Hook]
I gotta make it out and move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
Bet this time around they won't scare me
I am the last one
"The champ"
Won't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front lines with my weapon
I am the last one

[Verse 1]
Damn
I went through it again
After telling everybody I wouldn't do it again
I kind of feel like I've let my people down
Yup
But to get them right
I gots to pick myself up
When I heard this beat and hook
It was so raw
Looked in the mirror
Didn't like what I saw
But all I could say was
Shits gotta change
(For real)
Either get it right or take one to the brain
If ya'll knew the pain that I went through daily
Trying to stay sane through the wind
Y'all hear me
I'm slipping, falling, I can't get up
But this time I'm out of control
I don't give a fuck
But for the thugs
I'm the last hope for the team
I'm the reason why some niggas
Got a hole in their dreams
These cats know what's good
I am the hood
I ain't hoping that they don't
I wish a nigga would

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I gots to do it for me
Do it for them
I ain't playing with this shit
I'm a' do it to win
Know I can do it again
Cause I did it before
With little to no effort
And Y'all niggas know the story
First album dropped in May
Second in December
Both were Platinum in one year like
Y'all don't remember
Only nigga who's first five albums
Debut at number one
Wonder why I call you son
My son, I've just begun
To get started up with the hardest part of it all
It's to climb a slippery wall and
Stil don't fall
Break down and call up to God
When it get too hard
I know you ain't gonna let me go now
Brought me too far
Showed me I was a star
All my life, I know it
All ain't right, before I call it a night
I'm a thank you for it all
The blessings and the curses
And I hope you're listening
Cause there's a lesson in the verses
Yeah

[Hook]
