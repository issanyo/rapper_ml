[Chorus: DMX]
Let they DMX is here (8x)

[Verse One: DMX]
In vertebrates, it is composed of blood cells suspended in blood plasma
Plasma, which constitutes 55% of blood fluid, is mostly water (92% by volume)
And contains dissipated proteins, glucose, mineral ions, hormones, carbon dioxide
(plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation), and blood cells themselves
Albumin is the main protein in plasma, and it functions to regulate the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood
The blood cells are mainly red blood cells
(also called RBCs or erythrocytes)
And white blood cells, including leukocytes and platelets
The most abundant cells in vertebrate blood are red blood cells
These contain hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein
Which facilitates transportation of oxygen by reversibly binding to this respiratory gas and greatly increasing its solubility in blood. In contrast, carbon dioxide is almost entirely transported extracellularly dissolved in plasma as bicarbonate ion
Vertebrate blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated
Some animals, such as crustaceans and mollusks, use hemocyanin to carry oxygen
Instead of hemoglobin
Insects and some mollusks use a fluid called hemolymph instead of blood
The difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed circulatory system

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: DMX]
In most insects, this "blood" does not contain oxygen-carrying
Molecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies
Are small enough for their tracheal system to suffice for supplying oxygen
Jawed vertebrates have an adaptive immune system
Based largely on white blood cells
White blood cells help to resist infections and parasites
Platelets are important in the clotting of blood
Arthropods, using hemolymph, have hemocytes as part of their immune system

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: DMX]
Blood is circulated around the body through blood vessels
By the pumping action of the heart
In animals with lungs, arterial blood carries oxygen
From inhaled air to the tissues of the body
And venous blood carries carbon dioxide
A waste product of metabolism produced by cells
From the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled
Medical terms related to blood often begin with hemo- or hemato-
(also spelled haemo- and haemato-) from the Greek word αἷμα (haima)
For "blood". In terms of anatomy and histology
Blood is considered a specialized form of connective tissue
Given its origin in the bones
And the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of fibrinogen

[Chorus]

[Verse Four: Swizz Beatz]
Due to its importance to life
Blood is associated with a large number of beliefs
One of the most basic is the use of blood as a symbol
For family relationships through birth/parentage
To be "related by blood" is to be related by ancestry or descendance
Rather than marriage
This bears closely to bloodlines
And sayings such as "blood is thicker than water"
And "bad blood", as well as "Blood brother"
Blood is given particular emphasis in the Jewish and Christian religions
Because Leviticus 17:11 says "the life of a creature is in the blood."
This phrase is part of the Levitical law forbidding the drinking of blood
Or eating meat with the blood still intact instead of being poured off
Mythic references to blood can sometimes
Be connected to the life-giving nature of blood
Seen in such events as childbirth, as contrasted with the blood of injury or death
Ihave often noticed that
Ancestors never boast
The descendants who boast
Of ancestors
I would rather start a family than one blood will tell but often it tells too much
Dance mehitabel dance
Caper and shake a leg
What little blood is left
Will fizz like wine in a keg
Blood is a specialized bodily fluid that delivers necessary substances to the body's cells (in animals) – such as nutrients and oxygen
And transports waste products away from those same cells

[Chorus]
