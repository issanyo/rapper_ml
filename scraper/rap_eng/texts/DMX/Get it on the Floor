We don't give a what what
We don't give a what what

[Hook: Swizz Beatz (DMX)]
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker
Bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker
(Let's get it on)
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor

[Verse 1: DMX]
Once again it's the darker nigga
Hit or spark a nigga, break apart a nigga
But the dog is bigger, under stress
So unless you're wanting to bless to the chest
These slugs from the smiff n wess
Or the pump'll put a hurt on a nigga
Dump six motherfuckin feet of dirt on a nigga
My hands stay dirty, 'cause I play dirty the mob way
You don't know, fuck it find out the hard
A nigga's job is never done
I handle my business how it come
And there's never been a one on one
There hasn't been a problem, I dissolve em like salt, lock it up
Hate to fall but never wreck his car
And it's my fault, keep niggas on point ducking down
Niggas like you need to get bust, you fucking clown
I extort to support my peeps
And hold down the fort, never get caught, 'cause I creeps, nigga!

[Hook: Swizz Beatz (DMX)]
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker
Bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker
(Let's get it on)
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor

[Verse 2: DMX]
I'm at the crossroads, look but I'm not really sure which way to go
Should I play that low for what I did the other day
They on their way to float, got me striking this random
I can't stand em, fake-ass niggas want to be the Phantom
Looking over my shoulder, cause it's colder than it was
And start shorty, because I'm a little older than cuz
And the buzz from the saw, wit the chain to your brain
Will turn that big nigga to a fucking stain
The pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute
But I'm gon die by it 'cause I'm like knee-deep in it
And you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit?
'Cause when you look in my face, you see that hard shit!
"Cause I done been to Hell and back I ain't wit selling crack
I'd rather rob a nigga, leave him wit a shell up in his back
On the real just to show proof, hit the G.W.B
And blow the whole roof off the toll booth bitch ass nigga

[Hook: Swizz Beatz (DMX)]
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker
Bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker
(Let's get it on)
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor

[Verse 3: DMX]
When I crawl, leave a nigga sprawled out after I spoke em
I'll slit his throat, dick in the mud and let his blood choke em
Up north niggas get the pick stuck up in em
And in the streets bitches get the dick stuck up in em
My M.O. is man-slaughter kid
'Cause on the reals I done wet up more motherfuckers than water did
Slid, cause I got to slide when the dirt is done
A homicide but they want me on the Murder 1
But as long as I got my gun, I'm aight
Stay outta sight while it's light, and then come out at night
To make moves again, stomp and bruise again
I know I'm going to Hell, 'cause I choose to sin
All my motherfucking life I been the Devil's advocate
Now niggas never even knew the Devil had a kid
But he does; and when you hear the buzz of the chainsaw
You'll know why I'll split your motherfucking brains for!

[Hook: Swizz Beatz (DMX)]
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker
Bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker
(Let's get it on)
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
