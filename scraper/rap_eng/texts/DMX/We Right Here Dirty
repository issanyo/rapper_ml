Uh, uh, uh, uh

Bring it! What? We right here
We're not goin' anywhere, we right here
This is ours and we don't share, we right here
Bring your crew 'cuz we don't care, we right here, uh, uh, uh

One mo' time, I gots to hit the streets off, make the streets talk
Let 'em know it ain't a sweet walk
This gone be the only joint made this year that'll knock 'til 2003
And y'all gone see that the hottest nigga out there

Was, is, and will be me, just like that I can go away for a minute
Do some other shit, but bounce right back
And when it's on I'm comin' strapped, with some shit
That'll spit from dusk 'til dawn, and when you gone

Ain't no comin' back in the morning, like that shit was a dream
Nigga you gone that's for real, creep niggas like a seal, totin' steel
Stick a nigga make him squeal, oh, my God
Those can't be the last words of ya man
Damn ya man was so hard, come on!

Bring it! What? We right here
We're not goin' anywhere, we right here
This is ours and we don't share, we right here
Bring your crew 'cuz we don't care, we right here, uh, uh, uh

Here we go again, how many million did my last one sell?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for ten, it's never gone stop
And ever fuckin' time I hit you, it's goin' straight to the top of the charts
The champion, I'm a thoroughbred, my blood is strong

And I scratch 'til you done, cross the line
And ain't no more scratches after that, straight up
Niggas is dyin', yo, what the fuck, is you cats doin' runnin'
Around like this? Like you won't get stuck, yo, that's my word

I stay givin' it to niggas, and I stay not really being heard
But, y'all gone see that the same things thou done to them
Will be done to thee, and then you'll know that sometimes
Though you come thru the front, you leavin' out the backdo', come on!

Bring it! What? We right here
We're not goin' anywhere, we right here
This is ours and we don't share, we right here
Bring your crew 'cuz we don't care, we right here, uh, uh, uh

Bring the noise, and you better come with niggas
You don't give a fuck about, 'cuz you gone lose your boys
'Cuz we don't play and the silencer will silence any cocksucker
With somethin' to say, dog for life

Whether I'm on or off the leash I bite, streets are my life
Click, click, boom, another life taken too soon
Another mother had a funeral, still waters run deep
And the pain is forever alive inside, makes it hard to sleep

But I keep goin', goin', shit, I'm always careful when I walk
I'm always seein', knowin', the dog gone live, stay walkin' the wire
Over the fire, when I can I give the dog is good and how it's stayin'
Dog gone fuck with the hood, the dog fuck with the wood

Bring it! What? We right here
We're not goin' anywhere, we right here
This is ours and we don't share, we right here
Bring your crew 'cuz we don't care, we right here, uh, uh, uh

Bring it! What? We right here
We're not goin' anywhere, we right here
This is ours and we don't share, we right here
Bring your crew 'cuz we don't care, we right here, uh, uh, uh

We right here
Uh, uh, uh
