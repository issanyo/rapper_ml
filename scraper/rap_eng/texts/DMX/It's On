Ugh dmx
Clueminati
Is y'all motherf**kers ready for the ruff ride!
Grrrrr!

When I speak I'm understood, my decision is wood
See what I'm able to see, (ugh) 'cause my vision is good
It's like I see through the eyes of a wise old man
So I chill, and when I can kill this guy's whole fam
Something better to be thought dumb and remain silent
Then to open your mouth and remove all doubt 'cause if it came violent
See I'm gonna give it to you straight, so you don't ask anymore
You don't really want what you asking me for
It's a war (ugh), when it's on it's on, when I'm long (what)
Till I'm gone and I ain't got long
But while I'm here, (ugh) y'all niggas gonna burn
Be (? ) after this money (what) and y'all niggas gonna learn
All this f**king weak you've been talking about that driveby
And ain't did nothing but drive by
Listen shorty I'm telling you this for your own good
(uhh) everybody is the man in they own hood, for real

Yeah 'cause if it's on it's on
Bitch niggas keep frontin' then your ass is gone!!
Yeah 'cause if it's on it's on
Bitch niggas keep frontin' then your ass is gone!!
Yeah 'cause if it's on it's on
Bitch niggas keep frontin' then your ass is gone!!
Yeah 'cause if it's on it's on
Bitch niggas keep frontin' then your ass is gone!!

I always keep my enemies the closest (uhh)
Always make sure I know where the toast is (uhh)
Always cover my tracks when I creep
Always get away when I'm done to relax to d
I always know the rules of the game before I play
And always keep enough dough to know I'm good for the day
Always walk my dogs off the leash and
Always get my thoughts off the streets and
Always will ever lend a hand in borrow
And always no matter what plan for tomorrow
I always pay my respects to the dead
I always take at least one blunt to the head

Now always know -- (cut off) is gonna end up getting f**ked
And always know-- (cut off) is gonna end up getting stuck!
I'm always strapped; I'm always cracked
I've always rapped; it's always that
Always black

Yeah 'cause if it's on it's on
Bitch niggas keep frontin' then your ass is gone!!

Yeah 'cause if it's on it's on
Bitch niggas keep frontin' then your ass is gone!!

Yeah 'cause if it's on it's on
Bitch niggas keep frontin' then your ass is gone!!

Yeah 'cause if it's on it's on
Bitch niggas keep frontin' then your ass is gone!!

Never try to knock off rock on the block that ain't yours
Never take a man's life 'cause you hate yours
Never become so involved with something that it blinds you
Never forget where you from someone will remind you
Never take for granted what's been given as a gift
And never sleep on a nigga unless that nigga stiff
Never turn your back on a nigga you don't trust
Never turn your gat on a nigga and don't bust
Never expect to get away with the same shit more than twice
Never forget you could get it too for a price
Never bring it to a nigga if you scared to die
Never gonna do it -- if you scared to drive
Never gonna be another day it gets dark
Never get it -- here for the heart
Never say never, 'cause I never thought, this never thought never
Ever caught better, getting cheddar, with doing better, dmx!

Yeah 'cause if it's on it's on
Bitch niggas keep frontin' then your ass is gone!!

Yeah 'cause if it's on it's on
Bitch niggas keep frontin' then your ass is gone!!

Yeah 'cause if it's on it's on
Bitch niggas keep frontin' then your ass is gone!!

Yeah 'cause if it's on it's on
Bitch niggas keep frontin' then your ass is gone!!
