It’s about time I reacted look at y’all did to this rap shit
Knowin’ niggas is wrong, come on with the cat shit, wack shit
Get niggas, toe down, clap quick, blam, blam, blam
Go down that quick
Acting like the truth is gone
Heard em say, don’t deal with the ruthless one
This two piece leave your faggot ass toothless son
I go hard, (dawg, don’t do it)
Too late it’s done
Hold up, I done show you why the dog is the illest
Killers, you might not catch it, but you feel this
The realest nigga to ever do it
The realest nigga to ever go through it
And y’all gon bring me back to it
Y’all gon make me lose my mind
Came from crime, I’mma change with time
Niggas don’t know me
What d’ya mean I hold something
