She want to get down!
She's going to get down!
Every time She come around!
She Want to get down!
She can get down
When we come around!
Get down, turn around
Baby if you want to get down, get down!
Will you turn around? when you get down
If you want to come around
Baby come through to the town

When she come around
She come to the town
She go to downtown
So low i might drown
Trying to get you out
What you all about?
Stilettos and Selfies?
Chill soul will you tell me?
Tawny Jordyn Ring, Ariana G...
Dropped it low for me...
But not the girls for me..
Got a girl back home
And when we're all alone
We get up in the zone
Take hits from the bong
