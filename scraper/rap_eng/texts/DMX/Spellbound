Solo don't spell like this money, Know what I'm sayin'?
Need to get at me with that dumb shit
Hit me dawg. Hey Wood, what's up dawg
Ohh, Uhh. Check it out yall
Big Vee on the muthfucking tables
This how it's goin dizzee

[Verse 1]
Spell Bound, It ain't hard to tell, You go crazy, when the S-P-E-L-L
You won't catch it or match it, but once you how much it
Heats up the crowd, your beats won't touch it
As long as I'm the D-M-X, The rhymes are D-O-P-E cold
D-A-M-A-G-E an E-M-C-E-E, I get I-L-L and K-I-L-L, W-O-R-K U-N-T-I-L
I hit the best and I'm the best of them all, S-P-E-L-L-I-N-G until they fall
Dropping like an F-L-Y they T-R-Y to get wit, The D-M-X but always die
Another body in the M-O-R-G-U-E
You will be trying to battle and can't emcee
S-P-E-L-L B-O-U-N-D is the S-T-Y-L-E I like the to U-S-E
When I am rhyming or R-I-P-P-I-N-G
Keeping on timing I'm in my P-R-I-M-E
The D-M-X E-L-I-M-I-N-A-T-E-S C-O-M-P-E-T-I-T-I-O-N and the rest
Y-O-N-K-E-R-S the B-R-O-N-X, Mahnhattan, Brooklyn or Q-U-E-E-N-S
Is where I'm F-R-O-M, And I will have to show them
And if they are B-I-T-E-R-S I do not know them
I can S-P-E-L-L, W-E-L-L, Raising some H-E-L-L, Ringing the B-E-L-L
Staying at the T-O-P, I'm R-U-G-G-E-D
And if you went to Do B-A-T-T-L-E then see me
But you will L-O-S-E A-G-A-I-N-S-T me
The D-M-X cause I'm the D-O-P-E-S-T
I'll always B-E-A-T an E-M-C-E-E
That has enough heart to S-T-E-P T-O M-E
S-T-Y-L-E that is W-I-L-D, It's Spellbound, Thats a N-A-M-E
Pumpin' lyrics that are based on my abillity to spell
Then I just fuck it up it ain't hard to tell

Yeah. Keep that goin' man
Cause I'm 'gon show 'em somthin' real on the spellbound tip
I'mma show 'em somthin', You know what I'm sayin'?
I'mma show 'em some real shit, right here

Now tell me if you catch what I'm sayin, baby. I'm on some shit like, umm...

[Verse 2]
I am T-H-E O-R-I-G-I-N-A-L A-U-T-H-O-R O-F S-P-E-L-L-B-O-U-N-D

Now what the fuck I spelled was...
"Didn't you try to bite the rhyme, using the style that was made by me?
Of course you did, So don't lie, because you caught out there and straight
Busted chump. Now what?"
