[Introduction]
Getting down for what we stand for because it don't stop
Once the line's crossed


[Verse One]
I am from the ghetto, I don't do the disco
I just pull my pistol, take a chunk of your soul
It's me who ride up by you, police won't recognize you
Run up right behind you, and let my ratchet squeeze
And, you don't want no drama, pistol-whip your momma
Put that bitch in trauma, you don't want to war with me


[Hook]
Getting down for what we stand for because it don't stop
Once the line's crossed
Getting down for what we stand for cause it don't stop
Once the line's crossed


[Verse Two]
I don't have to use the fifth to be a threat
I stand six foot three, four thirty, any less
Motherfuckers' want their shit split, I ain't the one to test
Understand what I'm saying, if not, how I figure
Nine to your tongue while I play with the trigger
Will make you understand what I say a lot quicker
Do we have an understanding, yeah, my nigga
In case I be fronting, know they really don't want it with me
Come coming with them hollows and heaters - to put it, simply
So if your team don't follow its leader, then come, and get me
But all you cowards better believe it - you coming with me

[Hook]
Getting down for what we stand for because it don't stop
Once the line's crossed
Getting down for what we stand for cause it don't stop
Once the line's crossed

[Verse Three]
I'm known for getting up in these niggas' ass
And they don't want to, fuck with the bitch of this shit
Because I position the hits, speak with the nine
Niggas ain't ready for that shit that I spit
Oh no, get at these niggas for sure
Because once you cross the line, you already know we get dough
The quicker they slip, the quicker their ready
Holes in your Pelle, body laid up in the back of the deli
I thought you all already knew about me and these triggers
Get touched if you ever fuck with me and these niggas
The bitch is loose, got niggas like 'Bitch you loose'
I'm the realest bitch of them all
Because I get down for what I stand for

[Hook]
Getting down for what we stand for because it don't stop
Once the line's crossed
Getting down for what we stand for cause it don't stop
Once the line's crossed

[Verse Four]
Fuck I've got to say it for, you already know
I was going dizzy, I get busy with the flow
Oh, it's like that, alright, aye yo
Niggas coming through anytime, anywhere
Pop up and pop niggas, up right there
Put your man's brains in the motherfuckin air
Pop, pop, pop, you drop, drop, drop, stopping
Look at what I've done to you niggas
I don't want to be your father, tired of sonning you niggas
And, I'm sick of being bothered, I'm confronting you niggas
And take this And, run, in a minute, I'm hunting you nigga

[Hook]
Getting down for what we stand for because it don't stop
Once the line's crossed
Getting down for what we stand for cause it don't stop
Once the line's crossed
