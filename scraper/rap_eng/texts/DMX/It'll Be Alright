Uh,yeah sometimes,you just don't know...what you're here for...just keep walking,babe

(chorus)
I don't know what you've got cut out for me,and my life,but i know..it'll be alright.....
I don't know what,if anything,that you want me to do,but imma do...what it wants me to.....

Imma make it(make it)
Even though it looks rough(rough)
I've been a little scared
And sometimes shook up
When it's like that
All i got to do is look up-directly to God(man)
I've got the hook up
We go through what we go through
All for a purpose
We in the business of service
And most of y'all should've heard this
So whatever i do,imma do to the best of my ability
Even if it's killing me
Feeling me that's the real of me
Some us got it,and some don't
Some stand for what they believe in
And some won't
Some us do wrong with no remorse
Some of us do wrong
See the light and change course

(chorus)

I don't ask questions i don't need to know the answer to if at the end of the day,i know who imma answer to.there ain't none of us bigger than God.what it is:the more dirt you've been through,the bigger the scar..the more hurt you've been through,the bigger you are,and we'll see what is bigger than what you figure you are.we're all part of the plan,and try to stay at the right side of the fence(what)with the devil riding your sins.you can remember..sometimes,that's all you can remember,but it won't always be as cold as December.as dark comes to an end,they always do with the word of God.it's always true..have faith,babe!!

(chorus)

Im looking back(looking back)at life:how it was.i see that i was right where i was..right where i was.where i was supposed to be WITH God in my heart,and the devil close to me.he chose me to be an example to us all,and even if you stagger,you ain't got to fall.well even if you fall down,you get back up.whatever you think it is, it ain't that rough cuz there's gonna be a time when enough is enough!!you get up cuz you're fed up,straight up,call the devil a bluff cuz,hey,God is the glory:I've been through it in his lies,waiting to be saved by me..TELL 'EM MY STORY!!!!!
