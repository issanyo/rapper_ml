[Verse One: Golden Guru]
Thinkin bout my past
Yeah I do this for my dad
Thoughts gettin sad
Feelings goin bad
Thoughts gettin crazy
Doin same shit
PSM we underrated
Flow is constipated
Boy the shit is outdated
Feelin like Satan
Everyone is always hatin
Eliminate the competition
Women hate the optimism
Trynna knock me out the position
To the top
Niggas climbin ladders but I always take the hop
Rappers need to speak the truth or just fucking stop
This shit is too easy
Cut your piece of the cake, got me feelin greedy
His talent's never noticed
But he's always stayin focused
So I gotta step up and rep the team
Put em on my back, PSM, AMC, LTP
Man I do this for yall
Unsigned rapper but I'm better than most
When I get the paper the team's gonna toast
RIP

[Hook]
Don't fuck with me
(repeat x time)

[Verse Two: P-Stunna]
The way the world make me feel
Like I'm rollin down a hill and I am the wheel
In this state of the game
It's becoming harder to maintain
Bein real, tryin to attain
Homeostasis
On the basis
That me and Clip, we gon make it
Signed Guru, and now we racin
To the top
Of this mountain that we call hip-hop
So if you try to talk me down
Attempt to turn my optimism to a frown
Middle fingers up all day
So every time you come around the way
All I ever gotta do is just say
Please don't
Please don't

[Hook]
