And really don't know who you fuckin with

That's how we do 'em
Make cowards disappear into thin air by puttin shit through 'em
Never comin' back
Last time you saw that nigga is the last time you'll see that nigga
No more deaths
'Cause in a minute you gonna have grandma bein the only family member left
Bust my gun
If I gots to kill a nigga but I'm always down for the one on one
Dog for life
