[Verse 1]
Check it
I don't walk, I stalk, livin' foul like pork
Shuttin' down underground streets of New York
Hawk is what them niggas call me, cause they all be
Suckin' my dick and on my motherfuckin' balls, G
I know the half, so I laugh with 'em
A blood bath went I let the fuckin' raps hit 'em
Full clip, but only half did 'em
That's all it took, another crook
Taking out over a dirty look
I bag niggas but niggas that try and shot dead
You're only takin' a fuckin' thing from me with hot led
You know my style fagot, cause I'm always schemin'
In jail, niggas holdin' a sink screamin'
Police, but you got no peace
Yo, was that you big man, and a lot mo' grease
All I gets is that, cause niggas want none of this
Back streets are like track meets cause I'll be runnin' this

[Verse 2]
I got a ball type of ill flow that still go for days
Don't you know I could kill yo' ass in many ways
Watch you die slow like as much as you blink
Leave you in yo' crib till the neighbours know this'll stink
You's a blood link inc, write my name on the wall
Dog men X, def till the ball
Jump niggas call, beggin' for their life
And I just fucked that bitch that you call your wife
She life in strife and that's just how I want 'em
In this fuckin' me see my man get upon 'em
That's why I creep em, lay 'em, slide
Takin' mad motherfuckin' holes on the ride
Like the skin fly, like the Ferrari merkin', urchin, blast your ass cause
You're jerkin'
My dick my reck, most buss the teck
I'll fuck in yo' back, blast through your neck

[Verse 3]
The way that I'll be flippin' niggas can't understand
Niggas be like "Dog, I thought I was your man ?"
You shouldn't have thought and that's what you get for thinkin'
Think beacuse I'm near you I wouldn't get you niggas stinkin'
I'm the only allspring of a bad beam
Motivated by mad greed, I make the pad bleed
A bad seed from a rotten apple
Preacher talk shit get popped in the chapel
Flavour like Snapple, you can all get some
Cause it's all good in that hood that I'm from
I be the nigga dumb, and do 'em real dirty
Me and my peeps, oh my peeps is 7.30
Out to lunch for ever, won't be back
Don't know how to act, so we attack in the back
Mutherfucker, that's how that do
That's how that do, that's how that do baby
