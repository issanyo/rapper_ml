[Verse 1: Omar Wilson]
Always knew that it would happen one day
I was just waiting on my time to come
There was never nothing that could get in my way
Never settling for less
Life's put me through the test, yo

So many days and nights
Trying to get it right
But it's so hard (baby it's so hard)
When people try to keep you down
They think I'm out of my mind
Cause I know I was chosen
That's why I keep on moving
So much love it's what I'm doing

[Hook: Omar Wilson (and DMX)]
You need a little faith
To turn nothing into something
Even when you putting in time (uh, uh)
You gotta keep on hustling
With a little bit of love (what!?)
The world will keep on turning (yeah)
With a little bit of love
The fire keeps on burning

[Verse 2: DMX]
Niggas say I'm bugging
And ask me what's that shit I'm on
Cause I did them wrong
Carry breezy, and get 'em gone
What I'm on is some real "fuck the world" shit
And hoes like the cruddy nigga
So I'll fuck your girl, quick
That nigga Earl sick
That's what they used to say in school
Throwing tantrums, and stabbing niggas with pencils everyday in school
A wise man can play the fool for reasons of his own
I knew that I would understand the reasons when I'm grown
But now it's on
They started something they wasn't ready for
At the age of 10 I'm busting down a steady four
I'm coming out for visits, but what's that when there's no home?
Other kids' parents like, "this little boy is so grown"
I am what happens when you raised in the streets
And all I really want is to get praised in the streets
And he who lays in the streets with your last breath
Ask the lord for forgiveness and may you have a fast death

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Omar Wilson]
No, I'm never gonna let the world hold me back (I'll never 'em ever hold me)
Trying hard to keep my soul intact (I'm putting back my soul)
And it's come to one thing I've come to understand
All you can do is the best you can, that's why

[Hook]
