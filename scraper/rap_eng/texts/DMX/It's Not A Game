[Method Man]
Now I walked on ice, and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
Judge a phenomena, deadly but calm world in my palm
Dead by dawn got the right to bear arms, ring the alarm
Another sound boy dying, hot iron
Stuff flyin, out the hardware appliance
Baby, Momma Crying'
Sobbin' and grievin', you was at odds
With them kids, till they made it even
Let down your guard, yes you did
Now you barely breathin'
To win a whim, open season on a duck
We don't give a what
Yo, best, best to give it up
Joe and D, lets run these MCs, they phony
From Humphrey, they made Bogey
Saddle up your horse, there's the sunset Mosey
Jam-Master Jay deserves a trophy for this track right
Futuristic G past tight
If that's your girlfriend, she wasn't last night, punk
Little boy style's is mad chump, ain't no wins here
Sport is extreme, know what I mean
Gettin royalties, Down with the King...!

[DMX]
Uhh, uhh
If Im gonna rob, ima rob all night
If Im lookin for somethin its probably a fight
If Im goin fuck bitches then they better be tight
If thats dead, then the head better be right
If I gots to play ima play til I win
Since I gots to be here can't wait to begin
Wanna fuck shorty can't stand shorty friend
Cause honey friend fuck many many men
Stay wit the rats cause the rats is real
Wanna fuck, then we fuck, already know the deal
Shit, fuck what you look like, just show the real
And I keep A spot that we can go to chill
I love my, get down for the hoes
Only reason I come around is for the hoes
Pipework - I lay it down for the hoes
Hit em off with that dark brown, you know?

[Xzibit]
I'm on a path not thinkin bout a average man
Black Sedan my way through pitfalls and scams
Let the whole world know about this Likwit king
Programmed to ignite on site
So now I'm standin in a whole new light (whole new light)
In a area where niggas ain't tryin to fight (tryin to fight)
I feel my jaw get tight (jaw get tight)
It's like, these niggas get pumped up, and lick shots
At you, and yours, plus the motherfuckin cops
We got, blocks and blocks of non-stop hustle
21 backdrop, it's my turn to shuffle
Stay alert little pussy on the side can't hurt
Wear protection from the heats, so I don't get burnt
I got no time to be a star (*echoes star, star, star*)
I go straight from the car to the bar, and then get busy
Whenever provoked, I react like Bill Bixby
Incredible heat, X-to the-Z
And 'The Infamous' Mobb Deep, take it to the street
Don't waste my time (waste my time)
Tryin to disrepect me in your half-assed rhyme
(half-assed rhyme) that ass is mine
Been goin down like this since the beginnin of time
Eyes may shine
