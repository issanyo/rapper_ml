Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo!
There's wild MCs that day,  you knowmsayin
I give props to, niggas is nice, you knowmsayin?
But on the real, y'all niggas know!
That them niggas is not fuckin with me
You knowmsayin?
Any MC that disagree with me
Wave your motherfuckin arm
Cuz it can happen!

It ain't no secret 'bout how its going down once I put on the pressure
It ain't nothing but another nigga put on a stretcher
With a blanket over his face, take him to the morgue with the waste
'Cuz he was in the wrong place at the wrong time
So I gave it to him in his chest
In his throat, in his head, in his back, through his vest, yes
Ain't a whole lot to braking a nigga down fast
They call me black 'cuz thats how I'm gon' be on that ass
Y'all pussy niggas think y'all sweet
But ain't a fuckin thing going down til I eat
So can I beef? You betta while you still got teeth
'Cuz they about to get knocked out, hopped out
On that ass with a blast that'll make ya shit drop out
Popped out, through a you know what
Cuz you know why, and you know my
Motherfuckin name up in this game
And bitch, you know I
Will never be crossed flippin, but on some east coast terms
New York niggas do, fuck the perms
