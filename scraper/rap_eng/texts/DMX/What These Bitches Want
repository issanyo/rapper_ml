[Verse 1: DMX]
Ayo, dawg, I meet bitches, discrete bitches
Street bitches, slash, Cocoa Puff sweet bitches
Make you wanna eat bitches, but not me
Y'all niggas eat off the plate all you want, but not D
I fucks with these hoes from a distance
The instant they start to catch feelings
I start to stealin' they shit
Then I'm out just like a thief in the night
I sink my teeth in to bite
You thinkin' life, I'm thinkin more like, "Whassup tonight?"
Come on, Ma, you know I got a wife
And even though that pussy tight
I'm not gon' jeopardize my life
So what is it you want from a nigga?
I gave you, you gave me
Bitch, I blazed you, you blazed me
Nothin' more, nothin' less
But you at my door willing to confess
That it's the best you ever tested
Better than all the rest, I'm like, "Aight, girlfriend, hold up
I gave you what you gave me, boo, a nut!"

[Hook: Sisqo + DMX]
What these bitches want from a nigga?
What you want? (What you want?)
What these bitches want from a nigga?
Really want…
What these bitches want from a nigga?
I've been keepin' you up on it
Bling bling'n, all that jewelry, girl, I bought it
What these bitches want from a nigga?
Ayo, tell me what you want from me
Baby, tell me what you want from me
(So what you want?)

[Verse 3: DMX]
Ayo, I think about when a nigga didn't have
And a nigga told a joke, and the bitches didn't laugh
See, now I do the math, I see if you got this
And this and this to some cats, that nigga's the shit
And that's all they fuckin' with
But see these bitches don't know
If these bitches ain't for real, these bitches don't go
Knock on door, no show, I'm asleep, tryin' to creep
With yo' best friend, put it in, dig deep

[Bridge: Sisqo]
X, let me talk to 'em for a minute
Oh, I know, I know it's so hard to be
A victim of my reality
Heard you callin' me names, said I was trife
One thing you gotta know, I'ma be a nigga for life
