They want war
Ride Out!

[DMX]
Yo, you remember the first time we rocked sound stage
When the world was ready to let the dog out the cage?
Covered the whole crowd rocking from here to there
All you said was "throw your hands in the air!"
You'se a hype man nigga (What) I started you dude
You have bitches part of your crew that's harder than you
Let me tell you what niggas in jail say across that table
That you are the cutest bitch on your label
Only records you got are the ones you signing on (la la la)
Never been to jail, never had a block you were slanging on
We all rode with killers just think
But you, come on dog, the only thing you murdered was inc
You got to watch the shit you say to niggas
Sitting over there smiling, but pussy, I don't play with niggas
I'm about to make you a fucking believer
Next time send your man in your place cause I don't battle divas

[Hook 2x]

Time's up! What the fuck? That's the verdict
Cats spit some weak shit, dog done heard it
That's the best you can come up with? Fucking faggot
I'ma bout to run up quick, run up cliques (click, boom)
All you cats do is talk trash
And I got 50 that says Alicia Keys will bust your ass
What you about a buck 5? Buck 6?
I'm coming right for you nigga, can't duck this
Me jealous for what? You don't even know
The way you be running around dancing in bitches videos
You're embarrassing me junior, I loved you like a son
You been on my dick since "4, 3, 2, 1"
How the fuck you supposed to be the head of your crew
When everybody with you flow better than you?
You do it like this, since you gotta have dick to swing on
I got a blazing R&B joint you can sing on

[Hook: 2x]

Come on, come on
Uh, uh
What the fuck is wrong with this nigga man?
Fuck, don't he know?
Doesn't he fucking know?

Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf
