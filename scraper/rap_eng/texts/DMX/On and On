Let's make the bust wide open and [?]
Names ring two bells and on the mile got two sails
On the alley it was pincking and kinking
Niggas know the hack, come and make no decision
Same thing, and never knock out or locked out
Money was kinda big so I ball it so and sock it out
Then I'm up quick and up in the ceil
