[Intro: Juicy Sample]
Time, time to get paid
Time to get paid, time to get, time to get, (oh, this is that right here)
Time to get.. (New York!)
Time to get paid
(What up baby?)

[Hook (x2)]
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Now-now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid
Time to get paid
Time to get paid
Ge-time to get paid (BOOM!)

[DMX]
Money, money, money
Bitches, bitches, bitches
All these fucking killers but the jail's full of snitches
A dollar ain't got a fucking thing to do with riches
Say cheese, now I got pictures of what a bitch is
Got a crew of guerillas, stalk niggas like roaches
Put niggas lights out, buenas noches
You can go to the left, but don't lose the focus
Whatever the fuck you do, don't lose the focus
Ain't nothing changed, niggas throw them R's up
Come through on a higher boost, light them cars up
Vatos Locos, man we are nuts
You know that's us when we tear shit up, what!?
We get's it in, no muthafucking doubt
Ain't got to pop a nigga, I punch him in his mouth
Got ya soft like funeral music, cut it out
For real, fuck is all the noise about, bitch?

[Hook]

[DMX]
If it walk like a duck, I'mma treat it like a duck
If it look like pussy, then it's gon get fucked
See, we get down for real, blam niggas from the truck
And you can keep talking slick but you don't get stuck
You cats making funny moves and I don't know what you up to
But keep talking slick and you gon' make me say fuck you
I'm a grown ass nigga
Walk alone ass nigga
Bring it to you, ain't no beefing on the phone ass nigga
Nowadays there's so much bitch in niggas
I wouldn't be surprised if there was dick in niggas (make it stop!)
They don't make 'em like they used to
But y'all better get used to
A nigga keeping it real
Just because he choose to
They know I'm in some pain because I go against the grain
Go against the game and show a nigga that thing
Throw a nigga the flame
Keep niggas up
Double R for life, we deep nigga, what!?

[Hook: Biggie/Bridge - DMX]
All my life
I've been struggling
Problems I've been juggling
But I'mma be alright [x4]

[Outro - DMX]

Man... man... man... m---
Suck a dick
What the fuck?
Fuck outta here with that bullshit, hey
Real talk
Real fucking talk man
Fuck outta here with that bullshit nigga
I'd knock 90% of these niggas the fuck out, son

[Hook]
