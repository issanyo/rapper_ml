[Intro: Styles P]
Yeah, X
Dog nigga
What up?!
Somebody else sit right here

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Keep the boots tight
Two new guns, I'm hoping they shoot right
Life's a dice game, we beatin' the deuce twice
Corner 12:05 [?] brick at the coupe's price
Had to rob mad shit to get me through life
Had to blow mad trees to get me through nights
Coward ass niggas really get me too tight
Load up, let it off, niggas whole head is off
Piss down your neck motherfucker, you was better off
Letting your Beretta off
SP, hard work, tear your whole sweater off
Wife-beater and your white T
Turn all red when you split to the white meat
Still throw up nigga, what?
DMX and The Ghost, four-four niggas up
I represent the poor niggas, what?
Fully loaded hand gun, we roll in the cut

[Hook: DMX]
X and The Ghost
Cats feel different when they necks in the toast
Cats get a feelin' when they next to get roast
That's what they get fuckin' wit X and The Ghost
Come on, come on
X and The Ghost
Cats feel different when they necks in the toast
Cats get a feelin' when they next to get roast
That's what they get fuckin' wit X and The Ghost
Come on, come on

[Verse 2: DMX]
Cats don't know I ain't playin' with this shit
You keep playin' with the kid, is why you starin', gettin' bit
Leave you layin' in a ditch, it's your actions that make me
Ask you 'do you know who the fuck you playin' wit?!'
Evidently nah, I rep the R
Prescription, no description of what you saw
Whatever happened happened, it's in the past
That's why these new fake niggas ain't gon' last
Nowadays things feel like they in that movie life
And they names, just can't get right
No matter what they do they fallin' off
Nigga fuck you and your crew, you all soft
Y'all niggas is more pussy, the whole pussy
Think about it, don't please, don't push me
Man, y'all niggas was doin' some shit
That's gon' make it go bad for all niggas

[Hook: DMX]
X and The Ghost
Cats feel different when they necks in the toast
Cats get a feelin' when they next to get roast
That's what they get fuckin' wit X and The Ghost
Come on, come on
X and The Ghost
Cats feel different when they necks in the toast
Cats get a feelin' when they next to get roast
That's what they get fuckin' wit X and The Ghost
Come on, come on

[Bridge: DMX]
Y'all niggas already know what it is!
Y'all niggas already know what it is!
Y'all niggas already know what it is!
Y'all niggas already know what it is!
Y'all niggas already know what it is!
Y'all niggas already know what it is!
Y'all niggas already know what it is!
Y'all niggas already know what it is!

[Hook: DMX]
X and The Ghost
Cats feel different when they necks in the toast
Cats get a feelin' when they next to get roast
That's what they get fuckin' wit X and The Ghost
Come on, come on
X and The Ghost
Cats feel different when they necks in the toast
Cats get a feelin' when they next to get roast
That's what they get fuckin' wit X and The Ghost
Come on, come on
