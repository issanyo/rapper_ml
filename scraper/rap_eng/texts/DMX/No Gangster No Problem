[RaKalid: Hook]
I feel another problem
It's on til its on
Damn I gotta rob them
It's on til it's gone
I rebound like Rodman
It's on until it's on
Then it's on til it's gone
There ain't fu*k*n problem

I don't know what to say homey but You're switching up
Your attitude from when I first met you, I'm not mad
I'm just letting you know you are fake
Theres rules to the streets Aiight!

Rule number 1
You snitch to the cops Then You're ass get got
Layed up on the blacktop In a black box
Way back on the back block
Nah I ain't a gangsta, I don't gotta thug
Keep ya manners proper, Be careful who love

As for rule 2
Be cautious of surroundings, Don't sit around lounging
They're looking for you're bounty Survival of the fittest
You don't want to doubt it I'm real, not a critic
Take a step back ~ Pivot You Gotta know your map

Like a rabbit knows his ribbit
You're a fake counterfeit saying you're the realest
But your rap doesn't got one lyric that illustrates spirit
And you're not even a rapper. Damn, Now that's just stupid
