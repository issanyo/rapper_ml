[Intro]
I, I get scared and it comes
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I get scared when it comes
And I know I'm gonna be alright

[Hook]
I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

[Verse]
Y'all don't know things I know
Where I've been and where I go
Y'all don't know cause y'all can't see
Look, you do you let me be me
Y'all don't know the pain I felt
How I played the cards I was dealt
Y'all don't know what you're talking about
Y'all need to stop running your mouth

[Hook]
I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

[Verse]
I get down for real I know it your way
Sunday to Sunday when the game is gunplay
Remember that one day, I'm gonna get it
'Til I get it, all I get
We can get to them and the fat bitch cooking
Like a nosey this Snooki
Been at the age hunting, since the age 11
I think you on stage, you fronting
Look here
I'm that nigga and I knock on your door
You look into my eyes you be like "dog, what's wrong?"
You feel it like I feel it, there's something in the air
Wait come here, yeah it's coming from right there

[Hook]
I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

[Hook]
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I get scared when you're gone
And I'm gonna be alright
I'm gonna be alright

[Hook]
I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

[Verse]
You would never let me real so I always hate
Make a nigga take it back from where it all began
Even be real, ye it's that bad
Let me get to sippin' ye we're not that
Whenever you gonna do there's no concentration
Shit there's something on my cock take of your face
And you was in the wrong place at the wrong time
I'm taking everything you got I want all mine
How you gon' stop me when I don't stop for signs
Hey you got mine, I'm gon' start lying
But instead a nigga tryin' don't stop it from happening
I guess they won't get it 'til they stop clapping
