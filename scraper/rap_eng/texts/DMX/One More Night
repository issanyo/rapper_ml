Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Understand, see it's just something you talk about
You can't have the gates and shit
I walked her out
I could be a grimy nigga for real sometimes
That's why I lie cheap and steal sometimes
I know God made me
But what am I supposed to think he made me for?
My whole life has been a hustle
Money coming and borrowed
Half-way to the struggle pulled me out in trouble
God if You listen
I need you to help me, please
Oh you lost a kid
My back's against the wall
I am under pressure lately
I'm about to fall
No I won't let you
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Put me in the hood for a reason
Understand it's cold outside
But I ain't freezin'
You kept me warm enough
You kept me around long enough
To understand the days that come
The life of one man's the hardest
Of course you play dope
But you know you're the smartest
This is the shit we gonna do it
We have to get doing
The place that we all end up
Think about it
Heaven to hell is where you gonna end up
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Get back when I was a little mad motherfucker
Or was I really?
Or was I just misunderstood?
I don't know if I can take most of the times
And I don't know if I'm gonna make it
But I'm a do the best I can
As long as I'm a buy a 10
That's the best plan
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Take back when I was a little bad motherfucker
Take back when I was a little bad motherfucker
Take back when I was a little bad motherfucker
Take back when I was a little bad motherfucker
Take back when I was a little bad motherfucker
