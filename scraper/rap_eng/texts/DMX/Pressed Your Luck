[Verse 1: Kuniva]
Now people I live trifling, I express it through writing
If you can't feel it, then I must express it through fighting
And I just bought me a new gauge and added on a new knife
And I strike people so fast, niggas think I threw lightning
Clash with a few titans, blasted a few hype men
Been harassed by two dykes who wanted lou pikner
Plus you know I'm too violent, to be out with you whiling
Cause as soon as you driving I'm a spit a few 5 ones
And I love to Kuniv' son, and you left a live one
I know how to hide guns, from skinny to wide ones
Go buy me a long sub and hide it inside buns
You looking for hoes, and up in here you going find none
You niggas done tried once, and you can kiss my nuts
You soft little dry cunts, get stomped till your eyes shut
No time for the wild ones, I'm writing these five words
"Fuck you dick riding niggas," count it, it's five words
We deep as a motherfucker, we 'bout to get it crunk
You just another punk in the club about to get jumped
I settle my vendettas with AK's, Berettas
We dont supposed to be in here with our weapons but still they let us
Switchblade, brass knuckles, nickel plated belt buckle
Broken beer bottles, when we walk in you can smell trouble

[Hook: Mr. Porter]
I ain't set the stroke and I ain't for games
I just came to fuck and maybe get some brain
I got a woman at the crib so I ain't your man
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned
You know all I really wanna do is fuck
I ain't gon' let a money hungry women set me up
And if you think I'm that stupid you done pressed your luck
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned

[Verse 2: Swift]
I throw a brick at your crib, have you standin on the porch
Screamin, "Look what you did!" I ain't feelin no remorse
Nigga just pick up the kids, and Swift got first dibs
With these cherry hot slugs that'll barbecue your ribs
I'm preparin deathbeds, quick to bust lead
While I'm starin at the Feds, tearin off they legs
Once you drop dead they'll be swearin it's a plague
I'm sicker than a coke rastafarian with dreads
You get shanked if you move, ditched with no clues
Don't put shit on yo' tape but yo' skits and interludes
And once I finish you they wouldn't put it in the news
I'm nuts so you hoes ain't got the GUTS to interview
I don't give a fuck if we beefin or not, I'll squeeze first
I'mma heat up yo' spot, I'm a nigga that breathe dirt
On these streets every day, snatchin niggas yay
How you bitches needin work, you can get it from McVay

[Verse 3: Proof]
Missin since yesterday, perfect just for rape
See I'm on judgment day, numb from special K
Two tabs of X and vitamin C
Swallow Hennessey along with Tylenol 3
Grindin the teeth at the signs of the E
I lost six days at a time in the week
The crime in the street hold your parents for ransom
While D-12 gang rape Marilyn Manson
In twelve hours we blow a pound of the chronic
Barf up my stomach linin, drown in my vomit
Just bring who you gon' bring on, who you gon' swing on
I'm King Kong, guns blow you to kingdom come
Show you machine gun funk
Sixteen M-16's and one pump
The snub in my paw, shove it in your jaws
Have you running out this fucking club in your drawers
We lovin' the broads, there's nothin' to applaud
But fuck it it's all good, the hood is up in us all

[Hook: Mr. Porter]
I ain't set the stroke and I ain't for games
I just came to fuck and maybe get some brain
I got a woman at the crib so I ain't your man
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned
You know all I really wanna do is fuck
I ain't gon' let a money hungry women set me up
And if you think I'm that stupid you done pressed your luck
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned

[Verse 4: DMX]
The streets, the cops, the system, harrassment
The options, get shot, go to jail, or getcha ass kicked
(aight) The lawyers, the part, they are, of the puzzle
The release, the warning, "Try not, to get in trouble"
The snitches, the odds (uhh), probation, parole
The new charge, the bail, the warrant, the hole
The cell, the bus, the ride, up North
The greens, the boots, the yard, these hearts
The fightin, the stabbin, the pullin, the grabbin
The riot squad with the captain, nobody knows what happened
(what?!) The two years in a box, revenge, the plots
The twenty-three hours that's locked, the one hour that's not
(uhh!) The silence, the dark, the mind, so fragile
The wish, that the streets, would have took you, when they had you
(damn) The days, the months, the years, dispair
One night on my knees, here it comes, the prayer
My wife, my kids (uh-huh), the life that I live
Through the night, I was his (uh-huh), it was right, but I did
(uh-huh) My ups, and downs (uhh), my slips, my falls
My trials and tribulations (uhh), my heart, my balls

[Hook: Mr. Porter]
I ain't set the stroke and I ain't for games
I just came to fuck and maybe get some brain
I got a woman at the crib so I ain't your man
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned
You know all I really wanna do is fuck
I ain't gon' let a money hungry women set me up
And if you think I'm that stupid you done pressed your luck
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned
