[Intro]
Told y'all niggas
You just don't listen
Why must you be hard-headed?
Tried to explain, but you didn't hear me, though
You know
Grrrrrr

[Verse 1]
One-two, one-two, come through run through
Gun who? Oh, you don't know what the gun do?
Some do, those that know are real quiet
When you think you wanna try it, fuck around and start a riot
Niggas gonna buy it, regardless
Because I'm the hardest rap artist and I'mma start this
Shit up for real, get up and feel
My words, I make herbs split up and squeal
Ill is all I've been hearing lately
Niggas hate me, wanna duct tape me and make me
Put their brains on the wall, when I brawl
Too late for that 9-1-1 call
Niggas stay beefing, but a lot of them bluff
But not me because I'm a nigga that can get out of them cuffs
You think a lot of them's tough, that's just a front
When I hit them niggas like 'What you want?' The battle turns into a hunt
With the dog right behind niggas chasing them down
We all knew that you was pussy, but I'm tasting it now
And never give a dog blood, because raw blood will have a dog like what
Biting whatever, all up in your gut
Give it to them raw like that, and ain't no love I do 'em all like that
Four right up in they back; clack-clack
Close your eyes baby, it's over, forget it
Happened in front off your building, but nobody knows who did it

[Bridge]
What
Where my dogs at?
What what
Where my dogs at?
Uh
Where my dogs at?
What what
Where my dogs at?
Uh
Where my dogs at?
What what
Where my dogs at?
Uh
Where my dogs at?
What what

[Verse 2]
Niggas is puss, keep on running from the werewolf, owww
Howling at the moon on the roof (uh oh)
Eh, ah, no, get em
10 niggas on him, hope God's with him
Give me the bat, let me split him
I'll have em where the pillow and the casket won't fit him
Only reason I did him, he wouldn't fight back
Tried to strike back, left him like that, laying up with the white hat
Getting right back atchya when I snatch ya
Up out the grave, nothing but bones and ashes
Hittin' niggas with gashes to the head
Straight to the white meat but the street stays red
Girls gave me head for free cause they see
Who I'ma be, by like 2003
That Nigga D took it there, he thought it was a joke
He went through like 20 G's and thought that I was broke
Stupid, that's what you get for thinking
And eventually found that's what you get for stinking
Blowing up the spot when you rot
Plus, if it gets hot, they know you dead for four squared blocks
Hit em with the ox to the grill
Eh, ah, kill nigga kill
Yet and still you don't know that I'ma rob 'em
That nigga DMX is a mothafuckin' problem
Aight?
