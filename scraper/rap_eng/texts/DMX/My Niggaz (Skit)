Just 'cause I love my niggas, Ruff Ryders
I shed blood for my niggas, Ryde or die
Let a nigga holla, "Where my niggas?"
Get down or lay down
All I wanna hear is, "Right here, my nigga"
We here, nigga
You won't take this from me, baby
You will not take this from me, baby, ya know
My niggas, some niggas that you don't wanna try
My niggas, some niggas that's really do or die
My niggas will have you cowards ready to cry
My niggas will fry, my niggas will rob
My niggas keep niggas on they fuckin' job
My niggas know what it's like when shit gettin' hard
My niggas stay pullin' you other niggas cards
My niggas, it's God, my niggas, we'll shine
My niggas, just knew it was a matter of time
My niggas let me know to keep fuckin' with the rhymes
My niggas ain't no longer livin' with crime
My niggas is fine, my niggas is good
My niggas keep you niggas knockin' on wood
My niggas know how to take it back to the hood
My niggas will put you down right where you stood
My niggas, they could, my niggas, they will
My niggas take you straight to the back an' get ill
My niggas give it straight to the bank when we kill
My niggas put niggas on ice 'til they chill
My niggas is still my niggas is dogs, my niggas
