[Produed by DMX, Nemo, and Ron H]

[Intro: DMX]
Uh! (Our father) I'm a talk this (Who art in heaven)
Start walk this

[Verse 1: DMX]
In the name of Jesus
I can have everything good of the earth be given to me by him
In the name of Jesus
There would be never be a time that I have to fight the devil and I cannot win
In the name of Jesus
I lose all strong holds that the devil had over my life
In the name of Jesus
When I save a thousand two or save ten
So I thank the lord for my wife
In the name of Jesus
I want to thank you what you showed me what you told me
In the name of Jesus
I want to thank you for your love and watchin over me
In the name of Jesus
I don't have to, go through what I went through anymore
In the name of Jesus
I don't have to (What!) now that I got you in my life ever more (Come on!)

[Hook: Patti LaBelle]
I know it cannot happen without you, you you, without you, oh, oh oh oh
Without you

[Verse 2: DMX]
In the name of Jesus
You gave me the book, so now I just look when I need the word
In the name of Jesus
You took, a crook, gave him a new look now he speaks the word
In the name of Jesus
It don't matter what we did tell it to the lord and he forgives
Whatever it was right or wrong
I'm a catch up with the herd then I'm comin home
In the name of Jesus
I ran away for far too long starve too long
In the name of Jesus
Where people perish for lack of knowledge
They all too strong let's get it on
In the name of Jesus
I realize I'm a sinner
I repent my sins and right this moment am a beginner
Baby in the spirit, let me go
In the name of Jesus please let me go!!!! (Come on!)

[Hook: Patti LaBelle]
I know it cannot happen without you, you you, without you, oh, oh oh oh
Without you

[Bridge: DMX] + (Patti LaBelle)
I gotta say what's on my mind (Say what's on your mind)
You saved my life a thousand times (Saved a thousand times)
Gave me a dream that came to be
Opened my eyes so I could see

[DMX & Patti LaBelle]
I had my ups and had my downs
Until you turned my life around
And I want the whole world to see
They don't know what you mean to me

[Verse 3: DMX]
In the name of Jesus
All praises due to the shepherd watchin the flock of sheep
In the name of Jesus
Ain't even about where I'm steppin
You watch in the dark when I'm sleep

[Hook: Patti LaBelle]
I know it cannot happen without you, you you, without you, oh, oh oh oh
Without you

[Outro: Patti LaBelle]
What you want, sing!
