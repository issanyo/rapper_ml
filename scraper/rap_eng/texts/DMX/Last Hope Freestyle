Now 2013 been a crazy year for me
So much has gone down, so many memories
I'm happy that I got to go and make it this far
But you know this is the start, and this is all just a part
Of the path to success, naw I ain't done yet, 7 years I'll be a doctor one day you bet
I'm never givin up that's motivation, get to the top one day that's determination
I saw a lot of homies partying in college
While I was hitting the books tryna get some knowledge
And you know I missed out on a lot of fun
But it all pays off once hard work is done
This past year I suddenly realized
Who my real friends were and who was full of lies
I gotta watch out, too many fakes out here
No avoiding my emotions with a couple of beers
Don't want no connections, don't want love and affection
Cause once I get attached
My heart is open for attack
I know feeling this way doesn't seem too right
But it ain't an easy life, it ain't all black and white
I'm only human, I got my own problems
I'm learning my lessons everyday so I can solve 'em
I stay focused so I can show 'em
I played my cards right, Texas hold 'em
They laughed when I was working in a fast food joint
Thought I was a baby who never rolled no joints
Now they see me at the top and with me they wanna join
Cause one day I'll be counting Benjamins and not coins
If there's one thing I learned the most this year
It's that hard work now makes your future real clear
There ain't no shortcuts on the way to the top
And if they telling u to quit don't you ever stop
