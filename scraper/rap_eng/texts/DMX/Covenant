[Intro]
I thank you Lord for my birth
And everything that's followed
I thank you Lord for today
And I will pray for tomorrow

[Verse]
I thank you Lord for the love of my life and a friend
I made a promise
And I'm lovin' my wife 'til the end
I thank you lord for your guidance
'Cause it's all that counts
And right here, right now?
Lord, this is your house
I thank you lord for the dream that came true to light
And I ask you to bless everybody in this room tonight
I don't always do the right thing
But I ask you to forgive me
'Cause I need you here with me
Without you in my life, it's empty
I think back to how some people did me like violence was the remedy
And because I think of that now
I pray for my enemy, I pray for my enemy
I pray for my enemy, I pray for my enemy
I think back how some people did me like violence was the remedy
And because I think of that now
I think back how some people did me like violence was the remedy
And because I think of that now
I pray for my enemy
Not because of what I'll do, but because they don't know
There's somethin' better after here!
And everybody won't go
So, I ask you to forgive them

[Outro]
