Your show is bumpin' (c'mon)

And you're dedicated (you're dedicated), to me

Uh, huh, ah

Like to sprout when the lights is out (dmx)
Keeping niggas on point, that's what life's about (that's right)
You like to shout? I'ma put that shit to a-cease (huh huh) (yeah)
From here to the paper, from the bed to the grease (a'ight)
Like police, I get away with mad credit shit
Only the niggas that don't catch it, doin' some mad hungry shit (huh) (uh huh)
All that buddy shit was left alone, back in school (ugh) (c'mon)
Even then, the nigga was cuttin' up (yeah), actin' fools (what!)
Broke a lot of rules (why? ) just because I could (uh, huh) (that's right)
Got away with most of it, just because I'm good (uh huh)
Stabbin' niggas with wood, I was one of the first
Doin' dirt, but I'm still outrunnin' the hertz
And it's always worst than it looks (uh, huh) (c'mon)
But then you never understandin' the thirst of a crook (you arrested)
First comes the hook, the assault, then come the robbery (damn)
My world is always (ugh!) dark and ain't no stoppin' me
Come on!

You got me trippin' on my own feet (just dance for me)
