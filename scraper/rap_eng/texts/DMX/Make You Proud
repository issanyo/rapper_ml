[Verse 1: Los]
Real shit nigga, real shit nigga, ugh, yo, ugh
While everybody complaining I'm thanking god for my life
Every step that I take, all my wrongs and my rights
Everything that I did, everything that I saw
I thank god for my todays and I'm praying for my tomorrow
So please don't misunderstand, my perspective on drugs
I followed my own direction, though my connection with thugs
Hasn't passed up it's zone,but now I'm passed and I'm grown
So I thank god for that passion that got me back in my zone
How I make it through the hatred, truthfully I'll tell ya
I believe in my success more then you believe in my failures
Haters will try to tell ya give it up and stop your mischief
And I'm like nigga what I get a rush from opostition
When shit was getting tough I get it up with top positions
So opposite optimism ain't enough to block my vision
Nigga it's like the cool of the morning to the moon and beyond
I just use all of you as my fuel and I'm gone

[Hook: Sean Hayz]
I'm the one that wasn't supposed to make it
But I hope I make you proud
I'm the one that wasn't supposed to make it
So I hope I make you smile
Ooooooh, hope I make you proud
Yes I hope I make you proud
Hope I make you smile
Yes I hope I make you smile
Hope I make you proud
Yes I hope I make you proud
Hope I make you smile
Yes I hope I make you smile

[Verse 3: Los]
Ugh
Since everybody is happy, I'm thanking god for the rain
The days is harder than pain, These crazy thoughts in my brain
Major losses that came, replacing all of the shame
To obey the laws of the game and to just take it all as a gain
Staying off in my lane since they been dodging the fame
The things causing a change but ain't causing a change
So I'm praying for the ones that feel like nobody know em
Never knew how to love cause ain't nobody show em
They think its ? but reality is ill
It's easy to be fake but it's a challenge to be real
Everybody ain't rich but everybody got a choice
Nobody speak up but everybody got a voice
Guess we never see the day where everybody help
You will never see the day that I'm like everybody else
My niggas in the hood, get at me G
Just to think I needed rap, now rap need me, thats crazy
