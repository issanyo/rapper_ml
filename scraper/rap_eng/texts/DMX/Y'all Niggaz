Ah shit, what the fuck?
Are you serious?
Hit the motherfuckin' floor, baby!
Let's go!
Uh, uh, uh, YEAH!
Uh, uh, uh, YEAH!
Uh, uh, uh, YEAH!
Let's go!

[DMX]
Y'all lookin' for names, I'm lookin' for beats
Y'all lookin' for fame, I live in the streets
Y'all talk the talk, but I walk the walk
School street, home of the brave, NEW YORK
Y'all make movies, but I make moves
Straight up, y'all got somethin' to prove
Y'all niggas duck, but I swing back
Y'all niggas run, but I bring gats
Y'all niggas whisper, "X is a crackhead"
Aight fuck it, I'ma just crack heads
I bang niggas that cross the line
Y'all niggas talk shit from way behind
I stand my ground, but y'all niggas don't
Shit I go to jail, but y'all niggas won't
Y'all niggas walk around and get scared
But I don't give a fuck, I don't care

[Hook: DMX]
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the walk
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all
(Repeat)

[DMX]
Y'all niggas is pussy, straight up ass
I keep that thing, and I'll blast
Letcha man know, he don't wanna push me
Remember, it's you not me that's pussy
Y'all niggas walk light on your toes
I come through hard, kickin' down doors
I spit a mean 16 without a pause
Then let 16 go just because
You in it for the dough, I'm in it for life
You in jail beatin' your dick, I'm fuckin' your wife
I bring the drama, I bring the noise
Kidnap yo mama, bring her to the boys
I make shit happen with one word
You take shit laughin' nigga, you's a bird
I take niggas for everything they got
That's why I'm the dog and you not

[Hook]
