Swift with that
Kick that flow
Chill, sit back
Get that dough
Straight out the gate, imma scratch anyway
Imma mash faggot niggas got a plate imma stack
Stop bein greedy
Fuck it
Why should i?
Peep the bull shit with my good eye
Ya'll niggas ain't seen nothing like
This before
One to the back of the head
Will have ya kissin the floor, see
That's where niggas get it twisted
With that industry shi*
Or that in the streets shi*
Look, niggas had that gats, i thought you was loco
Till i put that ass in the choke hold
Uh-oh!
Told ya cowards from the get go
Dog is a jail nigga
I get low and
Get down
Bitch when i hit towns
..
Put that shit down
