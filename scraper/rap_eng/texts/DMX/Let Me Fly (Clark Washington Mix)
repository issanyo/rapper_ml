Uh. Yea. Uh. If you love something let it go, if it
Comes back to you it's yours. If it doesn't, it never was
Hold me down baby

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day

Hold me down, niggas wanna know me now
Didn't want ta play wit' me when to show me how
No meow
Is it all about the bark?
Let the dog lose baby it's about to spark
Light up the night, like the 4th of July
Niggas know, when I let go, niggas die
Wit' this Y and you don't know you slow like Baltimore
If you ain't tryin' ta go ya blow
I soak up all the pain and accept it in silence
When I let go it's violence cause the wildest
Leaves the dog barkin' up the tree for the cat
In the fog but ya'll niggas see is the bat
Flappin' away wit' em blind like Stevy
Niggas don't hear me, still tryin' to see me
Stop being greedy, ya heard what I said
Let me go, let me flow on my bed

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day

I sold my soul to the devil, and the price was cheap
A yo it's cold on this level cause it's twice as deep
But you don't hear me, ignorance is bliss and so on
Sometimes it's better to be thought dumb
Shall I go on
You don't want no real, what the deal is a mystery
How is it I can live and make history
If you don't see it then it, wasn't ment for you to see
If you wasn't born wit' it then, it wasn't ment for you to be
But you can't blame me for not wantin' to be hound
Lock down in a cell wit' a soul gettin' dwelled
This is hell, go get the devil and get me the key
But can't be worst than the curse that was given ta me
It's what I live for, you take away that and I'm gone
There's a difference between, doin' wrong and being wrong
And that ain't right
Just keep it fair baby
Put me in the year, and I'll take it there baby
Yes

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day

I'm a flow regardless because I'm an artist until I'm trapped
I'ma continue to hit the hardest whether I scrap or rap
Give me death but you ain't my friend
I see it in your eyes, you contemplate my end
You waitin' for that bend in the road, where you were told
That you would go, when you were old
And if you died young, it was told
So what the dilly, what it was worth
Think back 26 years, be like what of his birth
What if it was a miscarriage and I never existed
Have I given something that have been taken away you
Would of missed it
Didn't know, did I persisted?
It was the call of the wild
I'm here to say what's in my heart, and you call it a style
Don't put it in the cage, don't mistreat it
You say you hunger for knowledge, here it is eat it
Another song completed is another thought captured
Let me do my thing I got it locked wit' this rap shit

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day

Or give me death, uh uh uh, or take my breath
I'ma die anyway, but I'll be gone any day
Where my niggas?
Uh ha ha, for my niggas
Uh ha ha, for my niggas
Uh ha ha, for my niggas
