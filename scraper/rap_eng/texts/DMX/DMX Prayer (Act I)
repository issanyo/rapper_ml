[Prayer: DMX]
Prayer 4
Let us pray
Father God I am just learning how to pray... bear with me
First I thank you for the life of everyone that's here with me
Then I thank you for the love you give me, why?
I don't know; I don't deserve it, and it hurts inside
Many a nights I cried, and called your name out loud
But didn't call you when I was doin' good... too proud
And still you gave me love, I wasn't used to that
Most of the people that gave me love, they ended up takin' it back
That's somethin' new to me, so I'm askin' you for time to adjust
Let me make it there, I will be one you can trust
What I stand for, I put my life on, I do!
I guess what I'm askin' is: show me how to stand for you
