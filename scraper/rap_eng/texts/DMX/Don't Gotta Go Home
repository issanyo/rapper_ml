[DMX]
Ain't no sense whining about it now
I mean we knew what it was when we became apart of it, feel me

[Monica]
Yeah

[DMX]
It's Like

[Monica]
There's something on your mind, I can see right through you
I know your girl been treating you wrong
But she ain't no good for you, why do u hold it inside
Boy you should let me know, I just want to make you right
Be the one you could cry on

[DMX]
Baby, its like Baby, it's like I love my wife
We going through things and I ain't going home tonight
You got time for a nigga or is he still with you
Wanna meet at the same spot or should I come get you
I'll be there in 10, be in the front
I been getting what I need so imma give you what you want
One on one cuz you know how to talk to dog
You walk the dog and understand that New York is hard

[Monica]DMX)
You ain't gotta go home tonight
You can stay right here with me
(I ain't goin nowhere when you wake up I'm gonna be right there)
Don't you worry bout a thing (I ain't worried about shit)
You're here with me
(Look It's like I love my wife
We going through things and I ain't going home tonight alright)

[Monica]
It's kinda strange when you call she is never home
Now your there all alone and you deserve so much more
Baby, I can treat you better than she can
It doesn't make sense to keep on loving and keep on trusting
When in return all you get is nothing

[DMX]
Damn, you got me fucked up and im feeling it more
Never had a mistress distressed before
Come on ma, like it ain't that deep
Like there ain't no love there like I don't hate that I gotta creep
We go to sleep in each others arms
And I feel like this is where I belong
And if loving you is right  then I ain't  wrong
This is the same ol' song, wife and fam
Gotta be a father and husband but I am still ya man
Baby

[Monica]DMX)
You ain't gotta go home tonight
You can stay right here with me
(I ain't goin nowhere when you wake up I'm gonna be right there)
Don't you worry bout a thing (I ain't worried about shit)
You're here with me
(Look It's like I love my wife
We going through things and I ain't going home tonight alright)

[Monica]DMX)
This situation is getting critical (uh huh!)
I watch so many tears fall (uh huh!)
I know she not what you want
So why do u keep holding on
When im right here (What!)
All you need to do is call (What!)
Don't be afraid cuz she won't know it

[Monica]DMX)
You ain't gotta go home tonight
You can stay right here with me

Don't you worry bout a thing (I ain't worried about shit)
You're here with me
(Look It's like I love my wife
We going through things and I ain't going home tonight alright)
