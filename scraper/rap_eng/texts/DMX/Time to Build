[Chorus: Rakim sample]
It's time, it's time, it's time, it's time
This is time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, this is time to build

[Verse 1: Mic Geronimo]
I format my mind for combat
In fact I put a hole up in your back, god, itâ€™s on like that
Rollin' thick with my people ain't no room to breathe
Surrounded by murderous felons, drinks and bags of weed
(Man, listen...) I swing at ya and get fly with the M-I
I'm automatic trample in your static with my semi
So when I squeeze, I'm off in the breeze with these
Licking shots at them whack MC's (It's time to build)
With no direction, I rhyme with perfection skills
Drug a nigga like a pill when it's time to build
Keep it real, get your head rocked when I wreck shop
I'm bigger with my style, ain't a bully on your fuckin' block (Hey!)
Word is bond I go on
I'm breaking MC's with vocal tones over real rap songs
Insane in the brain, nothing left to gain
Grab the mic up with skill when it's time to build, motherfuckers

[Chorus: Rakim sample]
This is time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, this is time to build

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Niggas increase the pain when they shout my name
Horrified by the thought of hot slugs and graves
'Cause Ja is a sinister character loading that .44 caliber
Infrared aimed at your jugular
Who the fuck are you? Nobody cares
You just be another nigga that needs repairs
Talking to all them niggas shitting
And all them faggots that be steady bitching
Inside their insides twitching (It's time to build)
Signed, sealed, delivered, DOA
Push a nine to your mind and commence the spray
No bullshit, Natural's the king of left
Scared of life, but wanna play the game of death (Hey!)
What's next? Niggas wearing padded kotex
Pussy ass MC's get treated like rough sex
I'm possessed you can't feel what I feeler
Irv be easy on the cut, (It's time to build), uh, uh, uh

[Chorus: Mic Geronimo]
This is time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, this is time to build

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Yeah, fresh on the scene-a with the fuck-the-next-nigga demeanor
You know my work
I bless and press more skirts than the cleaners (Uh!)
I'm dead relaxed 'cause you cats can't stress the G
Ain't a enough jump in 'em to make you high enough to test me
Gwan'! Niggas is moist like Duncan Hines
Choice when I'm voicing my poise I got poison lines (Ooh!)
So flame on, I turn my game on the expert
Niggas get chills when you hear my name on the network
Fuck what you niggas kicking on the mic
You chicken, like you don't know what an ass whipping feels like
I'm giving flashbacks, I blaze niggas split like ass-cracks
It's the J to the A, smoother than jazz tracks, unh! (Hey!)
So when I'm browsing through your housing projects
Niggas get 5000, shit is rough
Time to close, I hit you with 16 of those
Next time, maybe more, but who the fuck knows?
(It's time to build)

[Chorus: Rakim sample]
This is time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, this is time to build
Check it out yo, check it out yo
Check it out yo, check it out yo

[Verse 4: DMX]
Check it out yo, check it out yo
Check it out yo, check it out yo
I'm peeling niggas caps like oranges
Hit 'em in the head with 2 by 4 inches
I'm a grimy nigga so I like my bitches cruddy
My clothes dirty, dick shitty, and my knife bloody
I did too much dirt to turn back now
I'm the reason my lil' sister smoking crack now
I'd feel guilty if I had a heart, but I don't
Could live a carefree life if I stop killing, but I won't
It's in my blood to destroy mankind
With every murder, I lose a little more of my damn mind
And I ain't got much left to lose, nigga
So don't snooze nigga, I'm telling crews, nigga (Hey!)
Just pay your dues, nigga, respect my motherfuckin style of rap
Murder your wife and your unborn child
This ain't wild just how niggas living on the street
A little something that can't be beat (It's time to build)

[Chorus: Mic Geronimo]
It's time, it's time, it's time, it's time
This is time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, this is time to build

[Outro: Mic Geronimo]
Recognize, understand, recognize, understand
Recognize, understand, recognize, understand
This is time to build
This is time to build
This is time to build
