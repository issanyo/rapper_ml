[intro]

[hook]
If you know god is working in your life
Shout it
If you know god then you're gon' be alright
Shout it
If you know god and you know what he's like
Shout it
If you know god then just jump and shout it
Shout it


[Verse 1]
Time wasting, all things that I'm chasing
Eating but don't like what I'm tasting
Everything I thought I want and hunted for
Had me wondering but then I wanted [more?]

Headed down the wrong path, self-destructive
What's my function? I know I am good for something
Lord let me know if my suffering will be in vain
Or how much longer will it rain?

Or how much longer will a stain
By the blood has been shed through out my life, remain
Or how much longer will the pain in the flame
The only thing i gave the game is saying your name


[hook]
If you know god is working in your life
Shout it
If you know god then youre gon' be alright
Shout it
If you know god and you know what he's like
Shout it
If you know god then just jump and shout it
Shout it


[Verse 2]
I went from "why bother" to "Imma a try harder"
Knowing the only way to make it is through my Father
Stay right beside me, during the ride was rough
And for a minute the devil tied me up

My lifes stopped working, but the clock warns, she was right on time
And I was so happy to see him that it had me crying
Then enjoyed him, know you got a saviour
Starting to be changing your behaviour

Make you wanna shout more, make you wanna live more
You can do it out more If you wanna get more
This is what I live for, this is what I do
What I do, It ain't for me, It's for you


[hook - repeat once]
If you know god is working in your life
Shout it
If you know god then youre gon' be alright
Shout it
If you know god and you know what he's like
Shout it
If you know god then just jump and shout it
Shout it
