[Hook: repeat 2X]
Now every since I could remember I been poppin my collar
Poppin poppin my collar, Poppin poppin my collar
Every since I could remember I been working this hoes
And they betta put my money in my hand

[Project Pat]
I know you sick of the sicker when you see the rims thicker
The paint dripper, the ice in my range glitter
I straight flip-ah, the cheese like pancake-ah
Rollin' for cheese like the leaves in my handbreak-ah
Project Pat ah tracting dime pieces-ah
Dirty South-Ah, french braid, gold teeth-ah
I'm out here making sense cause I'm out here making dollars
I keep a fast bro dawg and I pop collars

[Crunchy Black]
She's just another ho that I met in the hood
I told her I was Crunchy Black and it was all good
She might as well go on head and suck on my wood
And let me whisper something in her ear if I could

[Hook]

[DMX]
Yeah Yeah Gettin my country on WHAT! x4
Yeah this how we do aight?
I don't pop collars, I pop niggas in the collar
Pop niggas 'til they holla, Pop niggas for that dollar
Pop now he can't swallow, Won't be no more bitin
With a nigga gold gone, there gonna be no more fightin
Missed it nigga? I eat life, I shit death
Get down and go hard 'til ain't shit left
Break niggas pockets, Rake niggas pockets
Y'all niggas know the deal, make niggas stop it
Anything get said about dawg, get said behind dawg back
Cause y'all know how the dawg act
Light to the dawg without hittin a switch
Got 'em screamin sound like I'm hittin a bitch, AIGHT?!?

[DJ Paul]
Now when it comes to getting bread I got the keys to the bakery
A lot of dudes swear they play man they some fake-ry
Let me catch a girl up out some work and in my sight
And believe I'm gon be atcha in the daylight with a flashlight
I'm tryin to get paid however money is made
Alot dudes like to pay ladies to get laid
But me I ain't no pimp, I just love to borrow
Paper from a fat bitch, a ugly bitch, a model fa real

[Juicy J]
Well you know me by the Juice man hangin out with big trees
Standin on tha porch, drinkin liquor, drunk, smokin weed
Trying to get a paycheck, but work force ain't came yet
Thats why I stay in a girl ear to keep that pussy wet
