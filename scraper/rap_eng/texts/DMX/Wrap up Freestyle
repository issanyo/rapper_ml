Colder bring the breeze in
Been on the street before that twinkle in yours dads eye
You won't hear that I'm not leaving
Soon blow see me salute no magpie
There with my zoot colds mad high
Shooters but you won't see his piece like a fat guy
Pissed that his wifey knows that I'm that guy
Its that size, feel it in her gut like a bad vibe

G's that can't show their face in my videos its that peak
Saink like Wiley the way they roll that deep
Been running them tracks like a athlete
Holler at the goons come through like a stampede
Being broke is like a bad dream
So tired of dealing with dam feans
Feds give me bracelets, man I got my own pee
I always get my Bluetooth headset hands free

Swear down I was gone for ages
Out in that country trying to make Gibbs
Boydem wanna stop my wages
Because they know that I deal like Johnny Vegas
When I get on the playlist
Have your bitch getting whipped like dominatrix
The grinds not complicated
Dons in the kitchen he ain't got a apron

Been serving that food like a waiter
Cook the ting up himself man will cater
Get cats with Charlie no slater's
Cutting them trees that's how you make paper
I still scream fuck a hater
My bitch hates me I literally fuck a hater
Worried about me nigga go and get your cake up
Growing up I was

Beefing the darker yutes cause I a lighter yute
And cause I was a darker yute beefing the whiter yutes
Then moving dark in the dark trying to get my future brighter
Getting light from the cooker like I ain't got a lighter
Don hollas cold I can start your night up
Been pulling out hoes like a fire fighter
Been screaming out RODE when we were on a hype blood
Past tense, so you know that we didn't die cuz

But I heard your mixtape it was corpse
Think your married to the game well she wants a divorce
She wants a big man and your looking kinda short
She wants a big man and your looking like a dwarf
An i come in like fee fi foe thumb
Your runnging like these guys hold guns
I'll just spray one verbal attack
You'll be laid on your back I'll say that's a rap!
