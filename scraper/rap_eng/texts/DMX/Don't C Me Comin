[Verse 1: Tyga]
They Ain't See it comin
They Ain't See it comin
Think I'm running around my mansion
Me and my family getting money
We been gettin money
Nigga's know we run established
Tats across the stomach
Bitches say they love it
Say I'm thuggin and I'm handsome
15 million singles sold
Who taught a hoe to make it nasty
They Ain't See it comin
They Ain't See it comin
Even Mommy know I'm flashy
Jesus show the worth
Daddy still in jail
Sister made me a bastard
Police wanna pat me
Niggas wanna dab me
Bitches love me like passion
They don't wanna understand it
Cuz my ghetto manner show em who the fucking man is

[Chorus: Tyga]
They don't see me comin
They don't see me comin
You don't see me running, You don't see me thuggin
They don't see me comin
They just see me stunting
Push to the start, nigga I just hit the button
They don't see me comin
They don't see me comin
You don't see me running, You don't see me thuggin
They don't see me comin
They just see me stunting
Push to the start, nigga I just hit the button

[Nas]
Yo did you not see that fucking red light man

[Verse 2: Tyga]
They don't see me comin
They don't see me comin
Run the light like DMX and belly
Machavelli, dark illuminati, talking crazy we gonna stomp em in the lobby
Fight night she just wanna party
Now we up in Drais thats a hundred bottles
Crap table lost fifty thousand
When you work ems thats not a problem
They ain't see me comin
They ain't see me comin
When they see me all them niggas follow
Say you own all the shit you got
But the style you rock all borrowed
Getting money from day to day
I get paid like every tomorrow
Bitches I influence, niggas I influence
Who your fucking role model

[DMX]
Think I give a fuck about a motherfucking red light. Faggot cops can't touch me. That's me, untouchable

[Chorus: Tyga]
They don't see me comin
They don't see me comin
You don't see me running, You don't see me thuggin
They don't see me comin
They just see me stunting
Push to the start, nigga I just hit the button
They don't see me comin
They don't see me comin
You don't see me running, You don't see me thuggin
They don't see me comin
They just see me stunting
Push to the start, nigga I just hit the button

[Verse 3: A.E]
Going ball on you niggas
All my niggas gonna ball
Need a 100 bottles right now
I can hear the money talk
If you with me nigga, If you with me nigga
Let it go!
Threw my set up one time
Niggas looking from the floor
