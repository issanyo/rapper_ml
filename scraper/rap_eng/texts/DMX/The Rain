Now I know
Only I can stop the rain
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Now I know
Only I can stop the rain

It's not that we gotta do what we do
It's what we know
So to me it ain't nothing but being true
But..

Now I know
Only I can stop the rain

It doesn't have to be the way it is
You say it is
Just because for the past 20 years
Everyday it is (WhAt?)

Now I know
Only I can stop the rain

I won't even be able to walk out my front door
Without worrying about coming to conflict with the law
Cuz

Now I know
Only I can stop the rain

If I follow him, they'll follow me
And I'll speak life into the words that you can see
Cuz

Now I know (c'mon)
Only I can stop the rain

We get away with it everyday shit
But everyday shit catches up with you
And when it does you can't say shit

Now I know
Only I can stop the rain

If I don't, you will
What I won't, you still
What makes us feel like we gots to kill
When

Now I know
Only I can stop the rain

How many more lives must we lose
How many more times must we choose
To trust these fools

Now I know
Only I can stop the rain

If it ain't broke, don't fix it
I gave it to you straight, don't mix it
Twist it (what) up for some slick shit

Now I know
Only I can stop the rain

I don't have to talk to it anymore
I don't have to walk to it anymore
I'm out the door (what)

Now I know
Only I can stop the rain

I wanna find peace with the lord
I don't wanna find the peace with the sword
I can't afford to

Now I know
Only I can stop the rain

When everyday of my life
Is just a constant fight
Between wrong and right

Now I know
Only I can stop the rain

I thank you lord for my life
I thank you lord for keeping it loose when things got tight

Now I know
Only I can stop the rain

Only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the pain

Now I know
Only I can stop the rain

Only I can stop the rain, stop the rain

Only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain because the rain calls on me

Now I know
Only I can stop the rain

Only I can stop the rain

I'm out
