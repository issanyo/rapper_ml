Oh yeah

[1] - I've been waiting

Spent nights out chasing
For your love
But it's going down tonight
It's going down
I've been waiting
Spent nights out chasing
For your love
But it's going down tonight
It's going down

What did you think you would do?
What did you think you'd say?
After I told you how I was feeling
Never thought I'd see this day
I always kept dreaming
Never let failure hurt my heart
I knew that soon you'd see better
All I could do is hope and pray

[2] - Is there a chance?
Or a possibility?
That I can get close to you
I wanna get romantic with you
Do all the things lovers do
Finally all the things I've done
To get the chance to be with you
I guess it was sure enough worth the wait
Tonight I'll be wrapped up in your arms

[Repeat 1]

I always kept wishing
I always kept praying
Good things come to those who wait
That's what mama always said
Baby that phrase stuck in my head
There's nothing I won't do to please you
Given the chance
I'll do you right
Even inside I have to know

[Repeat 1 (2x)]

Ooh, oh yeah
Oh yeah
Hey baby, ooh
Oh yeah, ryde or die
Walk on by
Oh yeah, hey, hey, hey

[Repeat 1 till end]
