It's bout time I reacted
Look at what y'all did to this rap shit
Knowin' niggas is wrong,come on with the cat shit
Wack shit,get niggas torn down,slapped quick
Blam,blam,blam...go down that quick
Actin' like the truth was gone
And I'm sayin' gotta deal with the ruthless one
It's 2 piece,leave your faggot ass toothless son
I go hard,dog don't do it!,too late,it's done
Hold up,I'ma show you why dog is the illest,kill this
You might not catch it,but you'll feel this
The realest nigga to ever do it,the realest nigga to ever go through it
And y'all gon' bring me back to it
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Middle name is grime,came from crime
Thought I'mma change by time,niggas don't know me
But you can't hold somethin'
You ain't got it,show me
