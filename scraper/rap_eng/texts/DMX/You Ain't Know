[intro DMX]

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Dark Man X - DMX for short
Dizzark, straight out the grizzound
Top going dizzown
Niggas ain't built for war

[verse 1: dmx]
Running through niggas, that's how I do niggas
And two niggas that nothing for me
When they saw me,  looked the other way and tried then they tried to ignore me
Cause I put holes, like foot holes, in nigga's buttholes
Stomp a mudhole, and when I cut hoes, the fucking blood flows
[got to bustin?] niggas, why?
I was 10 when I died - the walking dead, with the infrared by my side
Keeping niggas in line, like a parade
Then they scatter like roaches when they get sprayed with Raid
Blow like a grenade, play them like Spade [] the plan, now
Which part of "suck my dick" don't you understand, you best
Act like you know, or get
Smacked like a hoe, we could scrap toe-to-toe
But yo, I'm strapped with the fo'
Pound, and i'm down for mine, with the crime
And if I gots to do time, fuck it, I don't mind
I handle my business and I shoot snitches
Cause I know nowadays, niggas is more ass than Luke's bitches
It's all good, I'm still out, knock on wood
Robbing niggas like my last name is hood, 'cause I could
Yo, I'm out that mob that goes to rob
The mad scheme to get green without the job
That housed more niggas than a shelter
And if a nigga ever felt a Heltah Skeltah, it would melt the brain, cause the pain is too much to bear
Let there be dark, for the dark is here

[Pudgee]
Call me the [] commander, ill grammar
Juiced in 80 from Tropicana, your bull shit like hammer, [and uh?]
Come to think of it, you won't get far
[] respect because I swinging more []
Been to hell and back, held hands with God, cruiser
[foes?] is easy parted like Red Seas by Moses
Ok, ok, ok
Anyway what you got to say eh eh
My lyrics come off of the head like a toupee
But you can't touch me, because I had behind my force-field
Your style is tired like an automobile
Creep TLC on the low with the flow
And competition, listen, I slay them like snow
I be quick to size it, like the sun of Rashid
Set it off when I come across like the horizon
Like Ted Danson, niggas give me cheers
I'm too deaf for you to kick that flavor in my ear
I rock like crack, rock a [] on your block
Won't stop, give you more knots than an episode of Cops
And I still say that you can't see me
Like Miss Jones, "this is where I wanna be"

[Ran Reed]
You ain't no gangster
Faggot ass nigga, stop fronting on
I be that kid you and your crew ain't got nothing on
I flip on [] that's supplied by Nick
Bitches heard we making moves so now they ride the dick
Trying to take my fucking loot
But they ain't that juke
I got something for they ass: it's a big black boot
Catch me slipping? Never, 'cause I'm always on point
Smoke a blunt, fuck a joint
Grab the mic []
Competition, I write two 'R's across they forehead
My metaphors is leaving niggas with a sore head
Pain killers couldn't even kill the pain
I make you go insane, like the Jamaican on a train
So refrain from any stupid thoughts that you have
Blowing up, just a tad, yellow niggas getting mad
But that's life, so face the fucking facts
I specialize in breaking backs, and ripping over flavored tracks
