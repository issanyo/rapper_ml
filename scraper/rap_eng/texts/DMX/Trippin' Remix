Broke a lot of rules (why?) just because I could (uh, huh) (that's
Right)
Got away with most of it, just because I'm good (uh huh)
Stabbin' niggas with wood, I was one of the first
Doin' dirt, but I'm still outrunnin' the Hertz
And it's always worst than it looks (uh, huh) (c'mon)
But then you never understandin' the thirst of a crook (you arrested)
First comes the hook, the assault, then come the robbery (damn)
My world is always (ugh!) dark and ain't no stoppin' me
Come on!
