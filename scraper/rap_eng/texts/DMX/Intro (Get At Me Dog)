Yo
There is no smile on my face No laughter in my eyes
Life may seem like a waste
But after nigga dies
Then you get the picture
I been tryin to show you for the longest
Niggas know
?Don't test the flow?
I'm the strongest
Whats wrong is the way fake niggas MAKE NIGGAS
Let em have it
?Reachin for the flame?huh
Let em grab it
What you don't know is gonna get you hurt
Five years later ha , dirt
Ashes to ashes, life passes on
Back to the essence, your presence is gone
WE ALL KNOW IT WAS WRONG!
But it still happen...
N dem punk motherfuckaz that did it is still strappin
Like they can't get it, but they will
Niggas talkin bout doing something, but they chill
Cuz they know, like I know the black albino is comin through like a rhino
Where my dogs at?
