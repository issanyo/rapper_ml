In the name of Jesus, let's pray
Father we thank you for this gathering of souls
See that when two or more gather in your name that you...
Wait a second
Your presence
We thank you for our lives father
We thank you for the great blessings
You've given us this day
We thank you for the air you've given us to breathe
Food you've given us to eat
Lives you've allowed us to touch
Lives that touched our own
We pray that we're able to keep these blessings to ourselves as well as other lives
We pray that any obstacle that the devil plans to place in our path be removed in the name of Jesus
We pray that every spirit that is not of you be removed
Every spirit of anger, every spirit of addiction, every spirit of jealousy, every spirit of lust, every spirit of greed
Be removed right now in the name of Jesus
Devil, we rebuke you
