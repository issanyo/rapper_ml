WOODSTOOOCK!
I need y'all to help me greet my dog on the stage!
And when I say DM y'all say X!
DM (X!) DM (X!)
When I say DM y'all say X!
DM (X!) DM (X!)
When I say Ruff y'all say Ryders!
Ruff! (Ryders!) Ruff! (Ryders!)
When I say Ruff y'all say Ryders!
Ruff! (Ryders!) Ruff! (Ryders!)
Where my dogs at? (Crowd barking)
Where my dogs at? (Crowd barking)
Where my dogs at? (Crowd barking)
Where my dogs at? (Crowd barking)
For real
Is that hot enough here for y'all?
I hope not cause we're about to make much motherfuckin hoter!

O-oh!
