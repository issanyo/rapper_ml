[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
Yea, Tales of the terrorist, Tales of the terrorist
Tales of the terrorist, Tales of the terrorist
Felonious, red blooded American

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Kansas City (City, City) That's where I really wanna be
Grime and gritty (gritty, gritty) Back up when I throw that V
Up in the air (air, air) That's five seven R D V
And you know nare (nare, nare) That'll represent like me
Yo we did it Kansas City, yo we did it, like Biggie say
Much love my left mind said that Tech N9ne is Iggy J
You can find me off in Kansas City on Saturday at Maniax
Or at the Motel 6 laying up with two chicks the Lenny and Squiggy way
Or jack, tripper I'm Tech the rap
Ripper on Cognac, liquor I'm Tech the gat
Clicker I'm up on that, thicker than water track a whipper snap
Who's tryin' to bring Tony Kennedy, Del Shawn and Chipper back
Signin' off, rhymin' off, the wall constantly
Timin' off, never that, clever raps the comp can't be
Creepin', seepin' through the crevices and hella beefin'
Thinkin' they can stop the heart of Kansas City
But the heart of Kansas City is beatin

[Hook]
Tales of the terrorist, fuck the recognition
But I guess my record just to reckless for the record business
Won't sell my soul to chase a check but I be checking niggas
Industry put lames in the game like Duncan Pinderhughes

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I want money in large amounts
My garage full of cars that bounce
Moving my tapes in major weight cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They running off at the mouth till I fill it up with my pump
They jump my automatic keep 'em weary
While you fronting like you Billy Bad Ass
Nigga you scary, I been knowing you for years
We was high school peers, in Junior High
I was itching' to kill, and you was, 'Ready To Die'
While you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases
Busting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places
Leaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried
Bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'mma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfucker's die
It's not the way I wanna live, my nigga it's how it is
Homie got into a fight last night, they killed his kids in this life I lead

[Verse 3: DMX]
Fuck y'all niggas talkin bout, think you playin wit?
Double R, G-UNIT, the same ol' shit (WHAT!)
Put the faggots in the ring, watch 'em all quit
All y'all niggas is pussy, suck my dick!
Ain't nuttin but a handful of man still standin
I remember 50 in a cypher when Onyx was "Slammin" (AIGHT?)
Now we meet again, it's all good my nigga
Back to the street again, it's all hood my nigga
Knock on wood my nigga, we both walk the dog
We ain't get to where we at by luck, shit was hard (AIGHT?)
But once we got through the trials it's all smiles
'til a big type nigga all of a sudden get wild
Now why you gotsta go and take me back to where I came from?
I'mma make you remember, where you know my name from (YEA!)
45th Street, and BLAOW-BLAOW Ave
I done ran through your crew and only let off half, nigga!
