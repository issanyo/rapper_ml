[Intro]
You know Dasher and Dancer, Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall (what's that?)
The most famous reindeer of all?
(Come on)

[Verse 1]
Rudolph the Rednose Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it grows (come on, come on)
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

[Verse 2]
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say (what's that?)
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

[Verse 3]
Then all the reindeers loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph, the Rednose Reindeer
You'll go down in history (forever)
You'll go down in history (forever)
You'll go down in histor-
You'll go down in histor-
You'll go down in history (now get it)

[Instrumental]
(What's that?)

[Outro]
Then all the reindeers loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph, the Rednose Reindeer
You'll go down in history (forever)
You'll go down in history (forever)
You'll go down in histor-
You'll go down in histor-
You'll go down in history (now get it)
