[Chorus]
Bring it! What?
We right here
We're not goin' anywhere
We right here
This is ours and we don't share
We right here
Bring your crew, 'cause we don't care
We right here, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
One mo' time, I gots to hit the streets off
Make the streets talk, let 'em know it ain't a sweet walk
This gon' be
The only joint made this year that'll knock 'til 2003
And y'all gon' see
That the hottest nigga out there was, is and will be me
Just like that, I can go away for a minute
Do some other shit, but bounce right back
And when it's on, I'm coming strapped
With some shit that'll spit from dusk 'til dawn
And when you gone, ain't no coming back in the morn
You think that shit was a dream, nigga? You gone!
That's for real; creep niggas like a SEAL
Toting steel, stick a nigga, make him squeal
"Oh, my God!" Those can't be the last words of your man
Damn, your man was so hard; come on!

[Chorus]
Bring it! What?
We right here
We're not goin' anywhere
We right here
This is ours and we don't share
We right here
Bring your crew, 'cause we don't care
We right here, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 2]
Here we go again; how many million did my last one sell?
Fuck it, I'm going for ten!
This never gon' stop, and every fuckin' time I hit you
It's going straight to the top of the charts
The champion, I'm a thoroughbred, my blood is strong
And I scratch 'til you done
Cross the line, and ain't no more scratches after that
Straight up, niggas is dyin'
Yo, what the fuck is you cats doing
Running around like this, like you won't get stuck?!
Yo, that's my word
I stay givin' it to niggas, and I stay not really being heard
But, y'all gon' see
That the same things thou did to them, will be done to thee
And then you'll know, that sometimes though you come through the front, you leavin' out the backdoor; come on!

[Chorus]
Bring it! What?
We right here
We're not goin' anywhere
We right here
This is ours and we don't share
We right here
Bring your crew, 'cause we don't care
We right here, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 3]
Bring the noise
And you better come with niggas you don't give a fuck about
'Cause you gon' lose your boys
'Cause we don't play, and the silencer will silence any cocksucker with somethin' to say
Dog for life, whether I'm on or off the leash, I bite
Streets are my life
Click click boom! {*gunshot*}
Another life taken too soon, another mother had a funeral
Still waters run deep
And the pain is forever alive inside, makes it hard to sleep
But I keep goin', goin'
Shit, I'm always careful when I walk, I'm always seein', knowin'
The dog gon' live
Stay walkin' the wire, over the fire, when I can I give
The dog is good, and how it's stayin'
Dog gon' fuck with the hood, the dog fuck with the wood

[Chorus]
Bring it! What?
We right here
We're not goin' anywhere
We right here
This is ours and we don't share
We right here
Bring your crew, 'cause we don't care
We right here, uh, uh, uh
Bring it! What?
We right here
We're not goin' anywhere
We right here
This is ours and we don't share
We right here
Bring your crew, 'cause we don't care
We right here, uh, uh, uh

[Outro]
We right here
Uh, uh, uh
We right here
Uh, uh, uh
We right here
Uh, uh, uh
We right here
Uh, uh, uh
We right here
Uh, uh, uh
We right here
Uh, uh, uh
