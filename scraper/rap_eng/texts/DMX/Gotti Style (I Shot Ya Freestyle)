Aaaah

Niggas don't want it
Yeah

Def Jam niggas hah
Mutherfuckers better stay the fuck out of our way
Understand that, knawmean?
We doin this shit straight gangsta style, Gotti style nigga
Fuck y'all

Uh, uh, uh
Ja's the torture
The high class, toss to D
Grimy and gritty, outter limits in this inner city
Niggas is definately assed-out, fuckin wit me
End up wit a gun in your mouth, straight cheese
I should bust em
Cuz see me killin you don't mean nothin
I'll put you through a lifetime of sufferin nigga
Then you'll learn that bridges ain't made to be burned
Drug money is rightfully earned, well deserved
Some rules just think, are fit for takes
And Ja's rules make em large, that you fatefully break
Unless you wanna get spanked, with the 9 fully loaded
We can murder each other, meet at the Crossroads
And if I die tonight, in the immortal words of Pac
My niggas gonna hunt you till you drop, believe that
Niggas is capable of all that, take your mom for ransom
Give little kids back, that's the way we do things
Never leave shells, never drop names
Roll with the game as it change
Ja's to blame, I'ma let this world share my pain
In my demise you can put it on my grave
"Here lies a lost soul of rage, seen brighter days
And outta darkness done graduated, may he lay"
And this I swear, here in Hell we don't play fair
Cross the line, with my nine I'll be bringin you here
Motherfuckers

Uh, GRRRRRRRRRRRR

Break fools that act like they knowin how it's goin
Dizamn, with the dizark, cuz that's that kid
Unmask that kid, look at that bastard kid
That don't mind having to break shit or take shit
That mutherfucker, if you ain't me you ain't shit
You fuckin faggot
You know I coulda been stuck it to you
Nigga I would even think about fuckin wit you
But I bet now your man is thinkin twice bout who to fuck wit
Shit is gettin bad, I'm robbin niggas I grew up with
And I know it's just a matter of time before I get shot
I'ma torture this niggas little sister and make him watch
Give a nigga a little room, now he's tryin to house shit
But I bet you look back on some mouse shit
When I put this in your mouth, bitch
Aaaah, a nigga bein broken off quick
Yeeck, is the sound he makes chockin off dick
How you feel, he eatin with a straw he has to suck through
Fuck me? No fuck you, now I gotta touch you
Fuckin bitch suckin dick like a jockstrap
Put them Glocks back
Tryin to be the first punk to have shot that
Get that? Got that? You know where you gonna be layin right?
I'm tellin you, hah, you know what the fuck I'm sayin right?
You will respect this, cuz it gets reckless when I cut the
Dun-nun-nun-nun-nun-nun, be like "What the--No"
But it's too late cuz the heat-seaker done found the heat
The concrete done found your meat
Cuz hittin the ground still hot from steam comin off
Eyes rolled back in his head, and coughin up chunks of flesh
Then niggas'll roll with his monstrous death, beatin punks to death
Ain't nuthin left but the memory of what used to be your life
Funeral payments, and dried up blood on my knife
Y'all motherfuckers don't understand, when it's on it's on
Hoping the casket was changed, cuz your eyes is gone
I know I'm wrong, that's why I did my dirt and slid
But you made it happen, with that bullshit you did
Now you want peace? Well take a piece of this ammunition
And get your ass tugged out the Hudson by some old man fishin
My mission is almost complete
This message will self distruct in two seconds
Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
