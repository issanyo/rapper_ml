[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Keep yo' hands in the air, 'cause we gon' take you there
And I know it ain't fair, but we just don't care
Uh-huh, uh, what

[Chorus: DMX]
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs is gon' be a thug wit me
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs is gon' be a thug wit me

Uhh, uhh

[Verse 1: DMX]
If I'm gonna rob, I'mma rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin' it's probably a fight
If I'm gon' fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead, then the head better be right
If I gots to play I'mma play 'til I win
Since I gots to be here can't wait to begin
Wanna fuck shorty, can't stand shorty friend
'Cause honey friend fucked many, many men
Stay wit the rats 'cause the rats is real
Wanna fuck, then we fuck, already know the deal
Shit, fuck what you look like, just show the real
And I keep spot that we can go to chill
I love my, get down for the hoes
Only reason I come around is for the hoes
Pipework, I lay it down for the hoes
Hit 'em off with that dark brown, you know?

[Chorus: DMX]
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs is gon' be a thug wit me
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs is gon' be a thug wit me

[Verse 2: Drag-On]
Y'know fuckin' wit me, ain't keepin' your health right
'Cause me and my boys, we keep it jail tight
The shit I pack is heavy, but the shell's light
When they drop the same time, you drop without a fight
Burnin' anything that I'm puttin' my name on
You might take a 'Drag', but you can't flame 'On'
I know y'all niggas don't owe me with a chain on
When it come to the fire I'm the kid they blame it on
When you see like eight cars then y'all know who we are
Niggas spittin' mean bars off the green jar
Never drunk but you see me leaned at the bar
Spittin' fire that'll melt the ice on your arm
You had that but for now dog give me that
'Cause dog you don't wanna see how my semi act
Fake hustlin' niggas, you'll pump any pack
When it come to this shit, I done laid plenty flat (C'MON!)

[Chorus: DMX]
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs is gon' be a thug wit me
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs is gon' be a thug wit me

[Bridge: DMX]
Do you hear what I tell you? Understand what you hear
Don't let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear
Do you hear what I tell you? Understand what you hear
Don't let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear

Uhh, uhh

[Verse 3: DMX]
What you niggas want? 'Cause I got it right here
Y'all niggas front, then I hit you right there
Not really impressed by what niggas wear
Faggots talk shit but I really don't care
I'm the type of nigga that'll die for the cause
Fuck what you heard, I will die for my dogs
Ain't scared of shit, will ride in the fog
Same thing but a bigger size than yours
I fuck with Drag-On, 'cause he spits the flame
Drag-On motherfucker don't forget the name
And we all takin' over, ain't shit the same
If you ain't out that mob nigga quit the game
And ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no other cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no other cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs is gon' be a thug wit me, c'mon!

[Chorus: DMX]
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug wit me
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug wit me

[Bridge: DMX]
Do you hear what I tell you? Understand what you hear
Don't let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear
Do you hear what I tell you? Understand what you hear
Don't let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear
