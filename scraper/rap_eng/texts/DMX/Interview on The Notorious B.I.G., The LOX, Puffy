You know what's crazy?
I never saw Biggie smile, until after he died.
And then I saw him smile in Hypnotize.
I was like "Oh shit!"
Like, the smile brings a whole 'nother light to your -- to your.. --face, like..
I mean, it's kinda hard to explain, I'm really good with words, but like, it's hard to explain what a smile does for a person. Because, you don't just smile with your.. with your mouth.  You smile with your eyes, like, you know, like a true smile can be seen even if a person's covering their mouth. You see the, the joy in their eyes. And you know, I saw that and I was like "wow", like "wow man, he was really enjoying his life and it got taken away from him." So, it was then that I cherished the smile. It was then. "Wow -- wow, thank you for that." I never realized that that was the moment that I cherished the smile until I saw Biggie smile, like,  this, "Hard, nigga, brooklyn, Who Shot Ya, like, yeah nigga get it get it!" And, then he was like smiling on the boat like..
imitating Hypnotize music video
"Oh shit, yo!"
It made you wonder like, "oh he's enjoying his life man!"

[Interviewer:]

Uhm.,.
Well, you know the LOX got signed before I did, even though I bought the LOX songwriters. You know, they got signed, they were a safer group, you know, Puff signed them. And it was a blessing and a curse, 'cause they were happy about getting signed first and being on the Benjamins and shit was going.. then they made them jiggy and put them in suits and.. and made 'em..  made them write  lyrics for 'em and took all that publishing and.. raped them. Like, "Damn, I'm glad I didn't".. you know? like.. You can keep that.  And we went to like -- So it was when they got signed, Dee was like 'yo, if you like The LOX, like, X is like, like, big dog, those are the pups, like you'll love him!' And one thing I respect about Puff, he told me to my face. Like "ehh, his voice is too rough, he's not marketable.." -- man, what you gonna do with that? You gotta respect that. You can't be mad like "what do you mean", you know, like, fuck dude, he told the truth, okay cool.
But um.. When the deals got on the table, he came back like "yo,I'll double whatever they gave you, and I'll lace your pockets". I'm cool homie. Pfft. If you didn't know what I was then, you just pretty much jumping on the bandwagon now, like, you don't know, like you- you- you still clueless on who I am or how to fuck with me. So, like, you're supposed to see that diamond shining a long time ago, like, you know, if you really that nigga you s'posed to see it like "oh, that's a diamond!"
