It started of dark, mostly night
Wouldn't dare let my darkness bring someone light
I gladly go through it all for the purpose of a lesson
That will hopefully turn out to be a blessing
No second guessing
Let me be an example of how strong this love is
And to never put anything above his, 'cause what if
It wasn't unconditional, then what whould we do
If he did how we do
We know we wouldn't supose to do the things
That we did but we did 'em
And if that wasn't bad enough then we hit 'em
But you saw it all, So we only ly to ourselfes
Help us, save us from hell
Let me be!

Let me be your angel, let me be the one for you
Let me be your angel, let me be the one... (let me be, let me be, let me see!)

I ask a lot of questions, 'cause I need a lot of answers
Sometimes I think I need to ask the questions faster
Surrounded by confusion, am I winning or losing?
Is it because the lifestyle that I'm choosing?
Ups and downs, Right from wrongs
Goods from bads, Rob out the ghetto all the good I had

Still I grab, opportunity and ran with it
And a brother still can't get it, man quit it
All lives have already been written
There's no need for asking'
Don't mess with the fruit thats forbidden
We know god loves us, but don't test faith
Because woulda coulda shoulda are all to late!

Let me be your angel, let me be the one for you
Let me be your angel, let me be the one...
You believe in

So many nights I felt alone
Without a friend I want to call on
Unlike the rain would never end
Untill you came and found a friend
And through my ups and my downs
I have someone to stick around
Your the reason I keep believing!

Let me be your angel, let me be the one for you
Let me be your angel, let me be the one...
You believe in
Let me be your angel, let me be the one for you
Let me be your angel, let me be the one...
You believe in

I wanna be, I wanna be ur angel...
