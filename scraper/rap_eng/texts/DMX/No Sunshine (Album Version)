It's dark and hell is hot
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone
Every time 'cause we don't play
"Who turned out the lights?"
Is what niggas be sayin'
Now you don't wanna fight
But ya niggas be playin'
Thinkin' it's alright keep playin' with that road
And you gonna know the night
When you layin' in that cold
Dirt gettin' tossed in your grave
Now it's all over
Preacher said you was brave
But now it's all over
You just one of the many, plenty I done gave it to
Ain't no savin' you
No matter how many tears your mom's cried
Ain't gon bring your ass back, plus in hell, you gon fry
Why? But now the only 2 relative questions is
Do we bury him or burn? Any suggestions?
Either way, you up out of here for good
Now when niggas mention you name
They knockin' on wood, did I get my point across?
Another body on the shotte, another joint I toss
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone
Every time 'cause we don't play
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone
Every time 'cause we don't play
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone
Every time 'cause we don't play
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone
Every time 'cause we don't play
There ain't no sunshine
When the Dark Man comes out
And I want mine so I plan to keep my gun out
We got four 9's so niggas run in and run out
But I bust mine 'cause I'd like to hear some shots
Get at me dog, niggas know how it's goin' dizzy
When it comes to that flow, I gets busy
Who is he? Dark Man of the unknown
One dog, one bone
Now who ain't goin' home? Looks like you
You hear strike 1, talkin' shit, strike 2
Won't be a strike 3 'cause I don't play fair
I'ma look you in your eye while he hit you from the rear
Be like, yeah, holdin' you up 'cause you fallin'
The Lord ain't comin' till niggas stop callin'
You was ballin' a minute ago in it for dough
Till it was, â€½Yo, I swear to God, I didn't knowâ€
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone
Every time 'cause we don't play
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Whatchu think you gon get?
Fuck around with my dough
Just so it ain't no mistakes, this is my show
One
(One)
Two
(Two)
Three
(Three)
Here I go
Your shit is quick and your shit is sleek
But this shit is thick and when you hear this shit
Damn right I can finish shit
If you caught that verse without a rewind you can see mine
But you be blind, I'll do it 360, come up from behind
Tap you on the shoulder, have you turnin' around
Hit you with somethin' that I'll have you burin' the ground
Be like, "Damn, ain't nothin' left of money but a pile of ash"
Life is good so please enjoy it while it lasts
'Cause you know ain't got much longer to go
The quicker you go depends the stronger the flow
When niggas know I don't give a fuck, right or wrong
There ain't no sunshine when it's on
