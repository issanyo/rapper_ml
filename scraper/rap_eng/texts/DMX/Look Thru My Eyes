Judge not, less you be judged first
My nigga, my nigga

[Hook]
Look through my eyes, see what, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

[Verse One: DMX]
Burnin' in hell, but don't deserve to be
Got niggas I don't even know that wanna murder me
Just because they've heard of me, and they know that the Dark is for real
The bark is for real, (arf) when you see that spark it'll kill
Peep how I park it and chill, take it over there, bark wit' it
From Y.O. to Cali to Baltimore back to New York wit' it
Come through flyin', up 1-2-9
Up the School Street 'cause I come through mine
Bark at my dogs, "Get at me, nigga!"
"Arf! Arf! Arf! Get at me, nigga!"
What the deal is? Never forget what real is
Them cats that used to say "X is the best," know he still is
Can't help but feel this, puttin' goosebumps on your arms
Take you there if you want but I lose chumps with the bomb
It's the calm before the storm
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and it's gettin' warm, feel me yo

[Hook]
Look through my eyes and see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street
Look through my eyes and see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

[Verse 2]
I can understand why y'all niggas is scared of me
And why the big dogs never wanted to play fair with me
'Cause I leave blood wherever I go, wherever I flow
Wherever I blow niggas who know I can go, feel me yo
What is it about the Dark that gets niggas where they about to spark
About to bark, take it to the heart 'cause it's real like that
Give him chills, but do I make him feel like that
Shit is real, what you don't know is gon' get ya
With the steel, what you don't know is gon' split ya
I can blaze tracks, make niggas play wax and raise stacks
Payback's a bitch; didn't you used to say that?
Play around in dirt, you'll get mud
'Cause you know, I can either spread love or shed blood
And bloodshed turns the mud red and real sticky
Or I can hit you from roof, make it a quicky
For real

[Hook]
Look through my eyes and see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street
Look through my eyes and see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

[Verse 3]
I bear my soul, niggas wouldn't dare, my role
Gives a nigga a heart of gold, but with a hole
Lost all control, my shoulders hold a lot of weight
Just like first time sold an eighth, then told it's not an eighth
But then it's out of state, and it's too late for changes to be made
That's what I get for fuckin' with strangers in the shade
This is it, y'all niggas got to give me a plate
For the same reason that fate chose to give me the weight
Take away hate, now I'm supposed to love the one that cursed me
The one that wouldn't give me a cup of water when I was thirsty
It was always him versus me, but now I gotta teach him
Personal feelin's put aside, 'cause now I gotta reach him
What I'd like to do is turn my head, like I don't know him
But it seems like I've been called on to show him, so I'ma show him
And if you never met me, then you've no right to judge me
I've got a good heart but this heart can get ugly

[Hook]
Look through my eyes and see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street
Look through my eyes and see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

[Outro]
Feel the pain, feel the joy, of a man who was never a boy
For real
Arf arf, arf arf arf
