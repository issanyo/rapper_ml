Lord Jesus, you have brought me from a place so dark
To the point where I can now feel the love in my heart
And I know it’s just a start, for there is more to come
So now I embrace it when I used to run
Didn’t know what I was running from or running towards
Until one day I saw it; I was running from the Lord
And when I came back you accepted me with open arms and said "All is forgiven."
And I became so strong that I could fight off the devil with just spoken words
Say it, "Devil I rebuke you" and I saw that I was heard
'Cause no matter what I've been through, I could deal with it
And because of what I went through, I was still fitted
With the armor that comes with the blood of Jesus
Knowing even when we're suffering, He sees us
Or when you're lost He will lead the flock to find the one
Just like any father trying to find his son
And let me remind you, no matter where you at He will find you
And help you put the negative behind you
Lord, give me a sign!
Please let me know you're here, or at least let me know you're near
Remind me to call you, when we need you
Remind me to call you, because we all need to
And give us the strength to just make it through just one more day
In Jesus' mighty name we pray
Amen
