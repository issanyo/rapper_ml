[Intro: DMX]
(grrrrr) This is where the magic happens baby
This is where the magic happens
Aw man

[Chorus: DMX]
The bark in me
It's the dog in me
So pop the leash 'cuz ain't no walkin' me
Jump a muthafucka like there's a frog in me
All on me
Nuthin' but war to me (C'mon!)

The bark in me
It's the dog in me
So pop the leash 'cuz ain't no walkin' me
Jump a muthafucka like there's a frog in me
All on me
Nuthin' but war to me (C'mon!)

[Post-Chorus: Tariah]
Let the dog out let the dog out
That's how it go down how it go down
I got the key so ima let it free
Feel the melody now let me proceed
The dog in me that gives me what I need
The dog in me they think it's a disease
So let me be what ima be
Let you see the dog in me (oooh)

[Verse 1:  C-Tru]
I don't ever cry
'Cuz I already died
And I don't need to fly
'Cuz I'm already high
And all these snakes wanna know 'bout what I feel inside
I wanna dig up a grave and bury them inside (goodbye)
So what's up, homie
What you want from me?
I'm bad by myself I depend on me only
I survive solely, on the grace of God, homie
I need to find my way so I ask that He show me
So I pray, Our Father, then Hail Mary, Glory be to God tell me can you hear me
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I inspect each step 'cuz I fear what's next
'Cuz in my mind, I'm dumping on you bastards
Leaving closed caskets, burning you with battery acids
And if you think my reaction is drastic
I'll wrap you in plastic, leave you stretched out like Mr. Fantastic

[Chorus: DMX]
The bark in me
It's the dog in me
So pop the leash 'cuz ain't no walkin' me
Jump a muthafucka like there's a frog in me
All on me
Nuthin' but war to me (C'mon!)

The bark in me
It's the dog in me
So pop the leash 'cuz ain't no walkin' me
Jump a muthafucka like there's a frog in me
All on me
Nuthin' but war to me (C'mon!)

[Post-Chorus: Tariah]
Let the dog out let the dog out
That's how it go down how it go down
I got the key so ima let it free
Feel the melody now let me proceed
The dog in me that gives me what I need
The dog in me they think it's a disease
So let me be what ima be
Let you see the dog in me (oooh)

[Verse 2:  C-Tru]
Did you know I been through hell already?
OD'ed already, almost died already?
No irie, kinda like Ox in Belly
So if the Lord wants to take my life I'm ready 'cuz...
The world got me going insane
It's like a full time job to lock the dog away
But it will break out so you best watch out
'Cuz ya can't talk shit with a dick in yo mouth
No one iller with the butterfly trigger
Rapid fire rap with with a flow so killah
Hit and run kill ya with an 18-wheeler
Then leave you like the walking dead MJ thriller
And I know I should join society
And follow laws and say apologies
But I just can't 'cuz their hypocrisy
Just bothers me, it's just the dog in me! (woo!)

[Chorus: DMX]
The bark in me
It's the dog in me
So pop the leash 'cuz ain't no walkin' me
Jump a muthafucka like there's a frog in me
All on me
Nuthin' but war to me (C'mon!)

The bark in me
It's the dog in me
So pop the leash 'cuz ain't no walkin' me
Jump a muthafucka like there's a frog in me
All on me
Nuthin' but war to me (C'mon!)

[Post-Chorus: Tariah]
Let the dog out let the dog out
That's how it go down how it go down
I got the key so ima let it free
Feel the melody now let me proceed
The dog in me that gives me what I need
The dog in me they think it's a disease
So let me be what ima be
Let you see the dog in me (oooh)

[Bridge: DMX & Tariah]
(grrrrr) This is where the magic happens baby
This is where the magic happens!  (C'mon!)

I'm gon' let it, gon' let it
Let the dog out, I said it
Got me off the chain so now you gonna get it
Now I'm doing bad and I just might regret it (Hey!)
Now the henny got me faded, baby
Hit swisher get it twisted, baby
'Cuz I live like today is my last, so I'm living fast ain't afraid to blast
Now you think you got me figured me out
When you see me shut ya mouth
So no apologies
I know just what you want, it's the dog in me
