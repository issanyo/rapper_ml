This is the way it's the way it's supposed to be
This is the way that I say that it's gonna be
This is the way that I say it's supposed to be
This is the way that I say that it's gonna be

Let me go, nigga, back up off me
Dog out the cage, cats walk softly
Talk real lightly, scared to bite me
Scared to death to shoot me, scared to fight me

Industry niggas is playing the wrong game
Up in a real nigga face, saying the wrong thang
At the end of the day, what that really mean?
Come on, let this bitch ass nigga flee

He ain't mean no harm, he ain't mean nuttin' by it
It ain't mean no wrong, you's a grown ass man
Let 'em know, dick ain't for ridin'
Dick is for findin' pussy, then hidin'

What is my dick doing in your mouth?
This ain't a pacifier nigga, c'mon, take that out, please
Oh shit bitch, this is how dog get down
Hands in the air whenever dog hit town

Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on

Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on

Y'all niggas heard it through the grape vine
What's that? X is back, I'ma take mine, yeah
Name of the game is get in where you fit in, dog
Nigga, I fit in at the beginnin'

Cats living, jumpin' out the window
Where'd money go? Yo, right out the window
Whether it's rock and roll, I lock and load
Shut 'em down, open up shop, oh no, com on

Dick ridin' niggas, stay up in it, where you goin' dog?
Upside your fuckin' head in minute
First you pick the dudes, stick and move
Witness smooth, real simple, stick to the rules

Why you gotta make shit complicated? I hate it
Y'all keep a nigga aggravated
Then rate it, loading up let the hungry eat
911, it's a beast running loose in the streets

Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on

Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, what?
