One in the back wit ya faggot ass face down
Lucky that you breathing but you dead from the waist down
Fuck is on your mind? Talking that shit that you be talking
And I bet you wish you never got hit cuz you'd be walking
But shit happens and fuck it, You done did your dirt
Niggas is wondering, how the fuck you hid your skirt
Right under they eyes imagine surprise to the guys
That one of they mans was a bitch in disguise
Stop fucking with cats in order hits and slaughter more kids
Let me holla at you yo the Baltimore shit
Nahmean I'm just robbin to eat
And there's at least a thousand of me like me mobbin' the street
When we starvin' we eat whatever's there
Come on you know the code in the streets, whatever's fair
Blood stains and chalk, means yo man couldn't walk
After the talk, about him not bein' on 1130 B to New York
And transforming ass niggas will get it quick
And yo for real that nigga 2Pac can suck my dick
And it's gonna take all them niggas in the West Coast
To barely move me, cuz when I blow shit up
I have niggas fallin' like white bitches in a scary movie
Ahhh, you know I don't know how to act
I get too close to niggas, it's like:
"Protected by viper, stand back"
What's this? I thought you niggas was killers, demented
Fuck ya'll want me to do wit this coward? Finish him descend it

East heard the west is, craving for a nightmare
