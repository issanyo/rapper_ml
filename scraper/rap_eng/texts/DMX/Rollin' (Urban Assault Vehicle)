[Intro: Fred & DMX]
Play the fuckin' track!
Play that fuckin' track! Oh there it is
Limp Bizkit! DMX (what?)
Redman (that's right y'all) Method Man
We just keep on rollin baby
Are you ready...
Are you ready...
Are you ready?

[Hook: Fred Durst]
Now move in, now move out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now
Breathe in, now breathe out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Uh!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (What!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Uh!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Tell me what you gonna do now (C'mon!)

[Verse 1: Fred Durst]
Now I know y'all be lovin this shit right here
L-I-M-P, Bizkit is right here
People in the house put them hands in the air
Cause if you don't care, then we don't care
See, I ain't givin' a fuck, quit pressin' your luck
Untouchable, branded unfuckable
So keep me in this cage, until you run that mouth
Then I'mma have the plague, and break the fuck out
And then we'll see who's left, after one round with X
And what am I bringin' next? Just know it's Red and Meth
So where the fuck you at punk? Shut the fuck up!
And back the fuck up, while we fuck this track up!
Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready?

[Hook: Fred Durst]
Now move in, now move out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now
Breathe in, now breathe out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Uh!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (What!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Uh!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Tell me what you gonna do now (C'mon!)

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Oh what, y'all thought y'all wasn't gon' see me?
Check my, dangerous slang atrocious
When I let these nuts hang, focus, it's Wu Tang
What the fuck's a Hootie and the Blowfish?
I wave my Black Flag at the roaches
Who approaches, these twin, supersoakers
Who have poisonous darts for culprits
Too late to get your blow gun un-holstered
You're left buttered up and lightly toasted
So what, I drink and smoke too much
So what I cuss too much, shut the fuck up!

[Verse 3: Redman]
Now when we roll, you motherfuckers tuck in your gold
Cause for the platinum, I'm jackin' niggas up in limos
It ain't nothin, for bullets to unbutton your clothes
Description, yellow male, tissue up in his nose
You bitches, swing the vine on the baboon nuts
I'm hairy as hell, outta hell and tattooed up
I'm a dog only fuck in the bathroom, what?
In high school, I dealt only with the classroom sluts

[Verse 4: Method Man]
My name is, Johnny, Donnie, Brasco
Tuck the gat low, cut your cash flow
Yell if you want money, funny
A hungry dummy snatch crumbs from me
Docs are hot, mix bodies in the mosh pit

[Verse 5: Redman]
And I'm the D.O., you lookin' at the raw invented
On Friday, I spit 35 to 40 minutes
Smell up the bathroom like Craig paw was in it
Endin' up on your back, Wu swords up in it
Anyone can match me, I crack 'em all to Guinness
Fuck how many thugs players and ballers in it
Brick City, Shaolin, better call us sinners
Boys that'll run up in your wife, maul and spill it

[Hook: Fred Durst]
Now move in, now move out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now
Breathe in, now breathe out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Uh!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (What!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Uh!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Tell me what you gonna do now (C'mon!)

[Verse 6: DMX]
It just don't get no darker than that kid with the Parka
Bald head with the boots who shoots to make it spark
Now I'm a fair nigga, but ain't nann nigga
Quicker than the hair-trigga, so if you dare nigga
It'll be like your man tryin' to hold yo' brain to yo' head
But you'll be shittin' on yourself cause you, already dead
And at the funeral you won't need a casket
Leavin' just enough of him to stuff in a basket
A tisket a tasket, I really need my ass kicked
My moms never let me forget, that I'm a bastard
I ain't never been shit, and ain't gon' be shit
That's why I take shit, whenever I see shit
It's just that D shit, D's short for do what I wanna do
And that's what I'm gonna do, right here in front of you
And I'll be runnin you and your man straight up out
While y'all niggas ain't runnin' a fuckin' thing but yo' mouth

[Hook: Fred Durst]
Now move in, now move out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now
Breathe in, now breathe out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Uh!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (What!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Uh!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Tell me what you gonna do now (C'mon!)

[Verse 7: Durst]
You, wanna mess with Limp Bizkit?
You can't mess with Limp Bizkit?
Because we get it on, every day and every night
See this platinum thing right here? well we doin' it all the time
So you better get some better beats and uh, get some better rhymes
You really, really, really wanna get shit started
Well people everywhere just get retarded
Get retarded, get retarded, people everywhere just get retarded!

[Hook: Fred Durst]
Now move in, now move out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now
Breathe in, now breathe out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Uh!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (What!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Uh!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Tell me what you gonna do now (C'mon!)

[Outro]
That's right baby!
