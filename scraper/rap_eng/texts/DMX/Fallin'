Father can you hear me when I'm callin' (callin', callin')
I need you to be near me when I' fallin' (fallin', fallin')

Stop me Lord, I'm going down the wrong road
And I'm moving fast for a person with a strong load
But the weight I bare
U can't wait to share
Scrapped it there, my faith was always there
I'ma make it yeah, life is what it is
Nobody said that you would make it fair
And I'ma take it there, built for war
Gladiator with a good heart but built for more
But sometimes ain't enough sunshine till you dark cloud
Cause the devil on line
Casue there was one time
You put your hand on me and said
Don't worry about where you go
Cause you're being led

Father can you hear me when I'm callin' (callin', callin')
I need you to be near me when I' fallin' (fallin', fallin')

Day gets hard, but it's supposed to
Call on God cause that's who I'm close to
Told him, I chose you
I was introduced to the Devil
And through it all, I still chose you
I needed you, you rose to the occassion
Stood beside me, no matter what I was facing
Here I go chasing the wrong thing again
But if I fall, I know its you not him
That's be right there to pick me up
Put me back on my feet, ugh, lift me up
Plus you gave me the voice so I'm gon say it now
I love my God and I'm gon say it proud

Father can you hear me when I'm callin' (callin', callin')
I need you to be near me when I' fallin' (fallin', fallin')
