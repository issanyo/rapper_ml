[Hook: repeat 2X]
If I'm gonna rob, I'mma rob all night (yeah!)
If I'm lookin' for something' then it's probly a fight
If I'm gonna fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead, then the head better be right (C'mon)

[Verse 1]
Here we go again, fuckin right
Dog man X baby, dog for life
Know how this shit go, built off fights
Bitch dog be like "AIGH, AIGH, AIGH"
OOH, this rap shit be getting kinda hectic
It's not a game nigga, cats don't respect it
Real shit's been neglected for far too long
Let's get it on!
I jump off slugs like packages from UPS
But you run when you see X
Pull out the front when you see Tex
POW, the light is what you see next
Fuck who you listenin' to, I'm the badest
98% of this industry is faggots
Due alone niggas don't want no static
Whent hey say who shot J R it won't be Dalas

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Y'all niggas don't know how the dog livin'
No matter what I do I keep on winnin'
Can't stop me now. It's just the beginning'
Gon' be there 'till the endin'
In 2005 you won't know
Stop, drop, open up shot, let 'em go
Hit 'em with the same flow I hit 'em with before
This time I'm goin' around the back door
Got me like "GOD!" you niggas is stupid
Get the drum crack 4 bars, horn then loop it
Same shit that you did to me, took what you did
Got niggas movin', but not institution
Dog done did it again, uh uh (WHAT?)
Dog is in it to win, uh huh (WHAT?)
Dog did a nigga and then, uh huh (WHAT?)
You thought dog was afraid? Nah ah (Come on)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My niggas, some niggas you don't wanna try
But then again, I be that one to bust a nigga in his eye
I don't give a fuck bitch all my niggas ready to die
Hit you with the things so you niggas ready to fly
You don't want no more
Bring all ya got to even the score
E5 is HOT? You want more?
You really don't know what you're askin' for
Listen old man, don't do that
We all dogs over here, don't act like a cat
We like, touch balls, round table with a bat
Start with the cheers, "Crack, crack, crack!"

[Hook]
