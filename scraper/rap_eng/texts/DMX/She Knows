[Intro: J. Cole & Amber Coffman (Sampled)]
She knows
She knows, ayy
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly I’ve never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
I’m gonna run run away (oh I), run run away, run away (oh I-I-I)
Run away and never come back (well all right)
Run run away, run run away (oh I), run away (oh I-I-I)
Show ‘em that your color is black (well all right)

[Verse 1]
Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home
You got a man what you want, what you want
What these bitches want from a nigga?
On some DMX shit
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit
But not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli
Good so them bad hoes try me, they try me
This is Martin Luther King in the club
Getting dubs, with a bad bitch in his ear
Sayin' that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta

[Chorus]
And she knows
She knows
And I know she knows
And I know she knows
And deep down she knows
She knows
And I know she knows
And I know she knows

[Refrain]
Well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can’t be what you want from me, well all right

[Verse 2]
Damned if I do (shit)
Damned if I don't
I'm passing up on bad hoes
Trying to be the man that she want, what she want?
What she—what she want from a nigga?
To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just want to sing on it
Got me up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
'Cause I told her I was sleep
'Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
She could be doing the same thing I suppose

[Chorus]
And she knows
She knows
And I know she knows
And I know she knows
And deep down she knows
She knows
And I know she knows
And I know she knows

[Refrain]
Well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can’t be what you want from me, well all right

[Bridge 1]
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye (Left Eye)
Michael Jackson, I'll see ya
Just as soon as I die (I die)

[Bridge 2]
Got me up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
Got me up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie

[Refrain]
Well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well all right

[Outro: Amber Coffman (Sampled)]
Run away, run away, black
Run away, run away, black
Run away, run away, black
Run away, run away, black
