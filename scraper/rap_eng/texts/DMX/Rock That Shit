(Whoa!) (What!) (Com'on!) Uh, Comin' atcha (What!), Back again (Aha!)
I see you bumpin' your head (What!), stumpin' your feet (Com'on!)
Songs in Dmx, Vivianna, Rock that shit girl

[Verse 1: Vivianna]
Get Buzzed, Beats are loud (Grrr)
If you ain't dancin', why'd you come out?
Get up and join the crowd, let me see you get down now (Com'on!)
Get wild, feel the heat, if you ain't bumpin', get up and leave (Yea)
No need to shy just be, let me see you get down now (Com'on!)

[Chorus: Vivianna]
Fly guys, get it rowdy (What!)
My girls, join the party (What!)
Base bumps, Dance floor rocks (Yea!)
People party, going out

All the fellas in the house, lift your lady (Yea!)
Lose control, now rock this baby
From the back to the front let me see you jump, Now com'on
(What we gonna do is Rock that shit!)
All the people in the house, lift your crazy
Lose control and rock this baby (Yea!)
From the back to the front, let me see you jump, Now com'on

All the fellas in the house, lift your lady (Yea!)
Lose control, now rock this baby
From the back to the front let me see you jump, Now com'on

[Verse 2: Vivianna]
Party's from baltimore, pushin' away through the dance floor

[Chorus: Vivianna]
Fly guys, get it rowdy (What!)

And as it hits me I get it inside, comin' alive
My guys, get it rowdy (What!)
My girls, join the party (What!)

[Verse 3: DMX]
This is how it's going down, Let that do what it do, and
But if it's gon' be, to be between me and you
Cause when, one start talkin', The guns start doggin'
And when the guns start talkin', One's not walkin
Let that go, Right now it's all about us
We got each other whether we drivin' or ridin' a bus
Going down like that, the real shit just don't come around like that
Don't get found like that, I like when you sound like that, Baby
That's the tight, Fuck all day, Fuck all night
Dog 'til light, night 'til the morning
Basically I gets my fuck on and gets the fuck goin'

[Chorus: Vivianna] (DMX)
All the fellas in the house, lift your lady (Yea!)
Lose control, now rock this baby
From the back to the front let me see you jump, Now com'on
(What we gonna do is Rock that shit!)
All the people in the house, lift your crazy
Lose control and rock this baby (Yea!)
From the back to the front, let me see you jump, Now com'on
(What we gonna do is Rock that shit!)
