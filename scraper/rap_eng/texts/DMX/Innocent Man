[Verse 1: Mark Morrison & (singers)]
Did my time (in a) county jail
(Just when) just when things (started) going well
(And I) paid the price (for the) crimes I did
(Wanna) change my life (wanna) raise my kids

[Chorus: Mark Morrison & (singers)]
(I'm an innocent man) misunderstood
(I'm an innocent man) just from the hood
(I'm an innocent man) misunderstood
(I'm an innocent man) a man is good

[Verse 2: Mark Morrison & (singers)]
Promised her (that I) that I'll change
(Gonna) live my life (in a) better way
(Have a) little you (and a) little me
(So we) can settle down (and live) happily

[Chorus: Mark Morrison & (singers)]
(I'm an innocent man) misunderstood
(I'm an innocent man) just from the hood
(I'm an innocent man) misunderstood
(I'm an innocent man) a man is good, understood

[Verse 3: DMX]
If everyone else had my eyes
Then, who I am wouldn't be a surprise
Just because I'm locked up don't mean I'm fucked up in the game
Just to think the (?) dirt they trying to throw on my name
Get arrested, but getting arrested don't make me guilty
But by the time I make it to court the media done killed me
Gotta good heart but we all do wrong
I really mean well but I'm going too strong
You say I'm rehabilitated but I still can't vote
You say I paid my debt but I still can't vote
Gotta pay taxes but I still can't vote
Come on dawg, y'all stay trying to keep a nigga broke
You just as crooked as us, fuck you trying to say
Cause once I pay that dough, the charges go away
Forget about it, it's okay
Cause I'ma walk over here and let the Lord pave my way, aight

[Verse 4: Mark Morrison & (singers)]
Change the life (that I) that I live
(Got me) living fine (living) negative
(Need to) leave the game, game (that is) destroying me
(So I) pray to God (that it) has mercy

[Outro: singers]
On an innocent man
On an innocent man
On an innocent man
On an innocent man
On an innocent man
On an innocent man
On an innocent man
On an innocent man
On an innocent man
On an innocent man
