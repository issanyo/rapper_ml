Ruff riders-DMX
Walk 'em dog!

[DMX]
You can try but I do fight
Just can't seem to do wright
Can't run with the big dogs
Niggas jeans is too tight
Ive been doing this for too long
This dog is too strong
And im not about to wait on a cat dancing through songs
What type of shit you on
Trying that shit there
Yeah,a nigga went there,and all you did was sit there
I begin and ima get it in. just watch this nigga win.we gon' walk these dogs till the bitter end
Now its like"oh,its him again!"i knew thats how you felt
Whats that'ass.i knew thats what i smelled...-
Theres a new sheriff in town,just been re-elected
You dont have to like it but respect it
Check it...-you can put on a vest,but ima still stop yah
Cause i gotta chopper sounding like a helicopter. you dont really want for me to pop the truck
Cause that mean i'll drop a chump when i cock and dump
Weather its Glock or pump,cats ain't ready
Half from here to here looking like spaghetti
Pull out the machette right off the lims
Bag up the pieces,wipe off the tims
Jump out the bens
Five cars deep
Four o'clock in the morning
Riders dont sleep
Shut shit down whenever we hit town
To getah nigga past just ain't my get down
You wantuh bring out the best,or bring out the worst'if you bring out the worst,ima bring out the hurse
Yall play poker but i play poker
Hit you from here to here and make me smile like the joker
