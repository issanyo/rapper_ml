Uh
This should go out to my dawg Kato
Rest in piece baby
He's the kingpin
Dawgs that I called my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things I do for my friends
We miss you, Kato! Kato!
Started of two dawgs wit the the goals
Nuttin but two dawgs walkin the same road
Two different cultures, but had the same heart
Enjoyed seein the light, but lived in the dark
5th album bumped heads in the park a lot
Was a pride brother, didn't like to bark a lot
Came correct, when he came, he gained respect
So I gave respect, we shared the same respect
Two names in wreck now on the circles
Two brothers with good heart, but if you start, two brothers that will hurt you
You know how that dirt, hittin four corners
Earh! Earh! Earh! Earh!, right back upon us
God tried to warn us but sometimes we don't see
When I first heard I'm like "this can't be, y'all niggas is buggin
Got the wrong information or suttin, please tell me that these niggas is frontin
God No"
