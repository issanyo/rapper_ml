[Intro]
Ayo, y'all niggas must be out your fuckin' mind
Thinkin' dog can't pull another motherfuckin' rabbit out the hat
Nigga, I ain't gotta check out my motherfuckin' sleeves
You bitch-ass niggas, fuck is y'all niggas
Y'all niggas just thinkin' I'm sittin' around doin' nothin'?
Oh my God, y'all niggas can't be serious

[Hook]
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up?!? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up?!? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that

[Verse 1]
Man, cats don't know what it's gonna be
Fuckin' with a nigga like me
D to the M to the X
Last I heard, y'all niggas was havin' sex with the same sex
I show no love to homo thugs
Empty out, reload and throw mo' slugs
How you gonna explain fuckin' a man?
Even if we squash the beef, I ain't touchin' your hand
I don't fuck with chumps
For those who been to jail, that's the cat with the Kool-Aid on his lips and pumps
I don't fuck with niggas that think they broads
Only know how to be one way, that's the dog
I know how to get down, know how to bite
Bark very little, but I know how to fight
I know how to chase a cat up in the tree
Man, I give y'all niggas the bidness for fuckin' with me
Is you crazy?!

[Hook]
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up?!? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up?!? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that

[Verse 2]
Once it's on, I come through, guns is drawn
Blam blam, lungs are gone, sons will mourn
From dusk till dawn, nighttime belongs to the dog
On the street past midnight, look for 'em in the morgue
Don't play with these cats
'Cause I ain't got nothin' to say to these cats
For the mothers that really do love 'em, please pray for these cats
'Cause I know niggas is hard-headed but I ain't got the patience
Don't want me havin' no patience turn into more patients
More trips to ICU 'cause I see you
Tryna get away with shit a real nigga wouldn't do
Where my dogs at? (Right here!)
See them niggas? (Right where?!?)
Get 'em boy! (Right there!)
That's how we do (Alright then!)
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
Yo, where we at, baby?!? (Creepin' through the fog)
From then till now, don't ask me how
Know that we gon' roll like them niggas
And hit every block on the job

[Hook]
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up?!? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up?!? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that

[Verse 3]
I get tapes doin' times, stomp niggas like grapes makin' wine
Five CD's with mad rhymes
Don't hit me with that positive shit, I know you lyin'
You really wanna stop niggas from dyin'? Stop niggas from tryin'
'Cause I ain't really got that time to waste
And I thought I told you to get these fuckin' bums out my face
Lookin' at you in your grill, I might be nice to cut
Once I split your ass in two, you'll be twice as butt
Yeah, you right, I know your style: pussy, 'cause I'm fuckin' it
Since we all right here, you hold my dick while he suckin' it
Motherfucker, don't you know you'll never come near me?
Shove your head up your ass, have you seein' shit clearly
Never heard that D be runnin', because D be gunnin'
I beat my dick and bust off in your eye so you can see me comin'
Empty clips and shells are what I leave behind
And if they get me with the joint, they hit me with a three-to-nine

[Hook]
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up?!? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up?!? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that

[Outro]
Where the fuckin' hood at?!?
No one's fuckin' with me, nigga, for real
I am the hood, I am the streets
You bitch-ass nigga!
Take it how you want, motherfucker
I’m in the hood all day
I think I’m like the only nigga, dog, that can go to the projects
(School Street, Home of the Brave)
By his fuckin' self and be good
Yeah, nigga, ask niggas on my projects (Y.O.)
When the last time they seen dog (Not too long ago, baby)
Motherfucker!
Dee, waah, ugh… (Y'all niggas is homeless)
Kato… (Where the hood at?)
