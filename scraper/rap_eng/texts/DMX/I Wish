[Seal]
I wish I could touch you, I wish I could see you
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen

[Verse 1 - DMX]
I wish upon a star, wish upon the night
I wish that everything that happens in the dark, comes to the light
I wish upon the days, wish upon the dream
I wish that everybody only said, what they mean
I wish I could have caught you, before you fell
I wish nobody had to go to hell
I wish Adam wouldn't have listened to Eve, when he bit the apple
I wish the Ku Klux Klan didn't own Snapple
I wish that nobody had to ever know the pain, that comes with the mental rain
I wish that no parent ever have to bury a child
I wish you wouldn't hurry to get wild
I wish for so many things, in so little time
I wish all these wishes weren't mine
But all I can do, is wish and hope it comes true
Pray to God and hope it comes true!
Have Faith!

[Seal]
I wish I could touch you, I wish I could see you
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen
I wish I could be real, I wish I could meet you
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen

[Verse 2 - Slug]
(I feel you X. Let me tell you what I wish for)
I'm wishin' there was no hunger or starvation
That God'll take back the nation from Lord's Satan
I wish I never popped pills, that I robbed from my grandpap, dyin' in a hospital
I wish I didn't lust more, I wish I could trust the Lord for a month or more
I wish I could physically touch or see Jesus in the flesh leavin' nothin' left to stress
I'm wishin' we were focused on the hopeless, broke n', strugglin' mothers who are dope sick
I'm wishin' New Orleans hadn't looked like an over flooded pool, with no chlorine
I'm wishin' Bill Clinton would return and I don't care, let him get his nuts sucked through the whole term
I wish I wasn't so selfish, I wish I ain't chase this cake, like I don't know what wealth is

[Seal]
I wish I could touch you, I wish I could see you
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen
I wish I could be real, I wish I could meet you
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen

[Bridge]
And the hours, and the minutes, and the seconds
Are just as important, take, nothin' for granted
And try to hold on, to LOVE, cause now I

[Seal x2]
I wish I could touch you, I wish I could see you
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen
I wish I could be real, I wish I could meet you
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen

I wish I could touch you, I wish I could see you
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen
I wish I could be real, I wish I could meet you
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen
Listen, listen, listen, listen...
