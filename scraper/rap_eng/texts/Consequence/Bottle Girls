[Verse 1: Consequence]
Fresh off the plane from Charlotte
And I'm on my way to Startlets
And I'm wearing all gold, you should know "The Code"
That's why Lynda Rose and Nikkita Maxx
Bring me back, and hit me wit a bottle like Da Brat
I'm throwing up racks that'll cause bird beef
Cuz I'm TURNT wit Bernice
And I turn into a beast when Graciii3's dancing
I'm the mayor up in the piece like it's Gracie Mansion
There's a chain reaction when, I'm tipping
My Mack game's wild and I ain't talkin bout Tristan
I'm talking bout kissing, I'm talking bout licking
And turning Kathy Red into a Kathy Griffin
Cats be trippin, what they testing me for?
All cuz they seen me hugging Destiny Moore
Well ain't that what destiny's for?
I probably come across like I got "Thick Skin"
Cuz as long as she's thick it doesn't matter which skin
I need me a "10" who be stuntin' with Slay
So I go Crystal Lake over Crystal Renay
So tell Supe and 20K
We in VIP where the Superstars stay
Where the Superstars play
And there's too many Superstars not to get paid, ma

[Pre-Chorus: Consequence]
This club's got alot of girls
Mostly model girls
Yeah Im trying to holla girl
Cuz you my favorite bottle girl

[Chorus: Charisse Mills]
So here we come wit them Sparklers
Yeah we gon start it up
Here we come wit them Sparklers
Yeah we gon start it up
The night is young and we gon party up
So baby let's start it up
Let's start it up
Baby let's start it up

[Verse 2: Consequence]
You can ask the Club Kings Out of Queens or Eddie-O to reply
Son I've been had my eye on Nisey Kamai
Damn I like thick thighs that be tatted up
50 put me on to that after he bagged her up
And when they add it up, you know my bill's through the roof
Cuz I cause chaos when Kyra's in the booth
But naw I ain't the rabbit on the cereal box
I'll make Miracle whip come out of Miracle Watts
Every year I get a watch that's flooded with new gems
But I'd rather watch and feel on Blu Gem
And I only play to win when you see me in the lobby
And I'm hitting on Mia Body
Cuz have you seen Mia's body?
I swear she's gon make me beat a body
Man I need a private party wit Jazzie Belle
Just to chase away the blues like Azrael
And If she bad as hell, we either smash or pass
And I'm killin the fresh on my classic swag
And since Yolie Monroe's got the fattest ass
Let her know I ain't playin with these stacks of cash
Baby

[Bridge + Chorus]

[Bridge: Company of Greatness]
I came here to spend it all on you
Spend it all on you, girl
Spend it all on you
(Yeah yeah, we gon' party tonight)
I came here to spend it all on you
Spend it all on you, girl
Spend it all on you

[Pre-Chorus: Consequence]
