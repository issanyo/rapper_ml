I've been about, I've been about my paper for way too long
I've been about, go under my couch, if you're running your mouth, yeah
I've been about, I've been about my paper for way too long
I've been about, having something to count
So I could catch stunt and I'm out
Ah, it's lonely when you don't know who your homies are
That's why I rhyme like there's no tomorrow
So I could back Tony or tomorrow
Or any other
Worth the call
Rock, but the pigs wanna see me whole
Tied, is it better to let sleeping dogs
Lie, I guess the joy to make big Shawn
Proud, and the few to make

And they all try, to show the
All dry, ah

Hitting me below the knees

Whenever I pin bars
So pin the charge and hope they stick
Otherwise you could suck my
Cause I don't care how you motherf*ckers get this deal
I
Some skills
Steal
Being

You think you disrespect us
I've been about, I've been about my paper for way too long
I've been about, go under my couch, if you're running your mouth, yeah
I've been about, I've been about my paper for way too long
