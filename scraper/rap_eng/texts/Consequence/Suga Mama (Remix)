[Intro: Beyoncé Consequence]
Damn that was so good I wanna buy him a short set
Uh, Uh, Cha'ya
Uh, Uh. It's the Cons' fool
Wor', wor', wor'

[Verse 1: Consequence]
I punch out hits, like Sugar Shane the new suga the game
And ain't nothin' sweeter by him or suger canes
I move suger queen, bought them 6 inch heels
And gotta feelin' like she livin' on the top of suger hills
And paid suger bills, now she calls me suga daddy
Cause I come through stunt in that suga white Cady
Bubble brown suga body Angelo
And Los Angeles, with a badda chick
Now she mad at Quence, cause of the game I run
So she wanna chew me out like suga the gum
But competition is nothin' so you really can't see me
Cause suga, I'm on a level that higher then Don Bredes
So you can eat your wheaties, Pop some suger smacks
Or sweeten up your coffee with dozen of suger packs
You still ain't no match for kid from Melby
When they sprinkle the club with more gees and suga tee
And yes indeed, he gots to be the all topsy
That killed the summer in that drop top B
So on the close n' open', forget the rope n' dough
Cause suga ain't knock em out, with the dopest quotes
Uh, uh

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I’ma be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store
I’ma be like a waffle cone that’s dripping down to the floor
The way you do if for me I can’t lie (lie)
About to be up in the mall all night (Yes)
Whatever I get you putting it on (Yes)
Don’t give me no lip let mama do it all

[Hook/Chorus: Beyoncé]
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be
Your suga give mama some suga mama
Suga ma-ma-mama (Suga Mama)
I’m your suga mama (Suga Mama)
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be (gots to be)
New whip, new heavy on the wrist
Cause I’m a suga ma-ma-mama
I’m your suga mama, suga mama

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Hey, hey, Sit on mama lap
Hey, hey, Come sit on mama lap
Hey, Come sit on mama lap
Hey, hey, Come sit on mama lap. Hey

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
It’s so good to the point that I’d
Do anything to keep you home
Baby what you want me to buy
My accountant’s waiting on the phone (on the phone)
Just the thought of making love to you (you)
Dropping everything that’s what I’ll do (I'll do)
Whatever I get you putting it on (Boy)
Now take it off while I watch you perform

[Hook/Chorus: Beyoncé]
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be
Your suga give mama some suga mama
Suga ma-ma-mama (Suga Mama)
I’m your suga mama (Suga Mama)
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be (gots to be)
New whip, new heavy on the wrist
Cause I’m a suga ma-ma-mama
I’m your suga mama, suga mama
Cause I’m a suga ma-ma-mama
I’m your suga mama, suga mama

[Bridge: Beyonce]

[Breakdown/Verse 3: Beyoncé]
And I’ve always been the type to take care of mine
(I know just what I’m doing)
(Don’t you worry it’s cool and everything is steady)
(Claimed you on my taxes already, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I promise I won’t let no bills get behind
(Cause every touch, every kiss and hug)
You ‘bes believe it’ll be on time
Suga mama mama mama yeah yeah yeah

[Hook/Chorus: Beyonce (with Ad-libs)]
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be
Your suga give mama some suga mama (Give you all my money baby)
Suga ma-ma-mama (Suga Mama)
I’m your suga mama (Suga Mama/Turn me out, boy, somthin' crazy)
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be (Take my credit card, The key to my house/gots to be)
New whip, new heavy on the wrist (Take my car)
Cause I’m a suga ma-ma-mama (Don't look and tokin' mama some Suga)
I’m your suga mama, suga mama (Suga, before you walk out that door)

[Outro/Bridge: Beyonce 2x]
Hey, hey, Sit on mama lap (Yes)
Hey, hey, Come sit on mama lap (Yes)

Hey, hey, Come sit on mama lap. Hey (Yeah, yeah!)
