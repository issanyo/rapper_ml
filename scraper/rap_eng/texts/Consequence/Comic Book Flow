Let's take it from the top
I don't wear a cape and got super friends
I just rape the game and drive a stupid Benz
Bout to activate the car, wonder twins
And during the dark night is when my fun begins
It's been grim who they asking for
Cause homie I do my thing and I'm back for more
Why you think they say I'm fantastic for/Fantastic Four?
Tell the justice league I ain't going back to court
Or anywhere near the bottom
Cause my flow is like a got a few peers from Gotham
It feels like I'm caught up in the middle
With some jokers with some riddles who dress like penguins
Everytime it drizzle
And some cats woman
Who wanna tend to riddles
End up on my griddle
Baby girl it's all real
Your boy ain't from Smallville
So I be at my crib tonight
You more than welcome to come
And be my kryptonite
The man of steel plus I could throw the web like Peter Parker
So anybody else with a cursor
Is just a Silver Surfer what a nerve to
Think I don’t keep the pound
But I got the competition beat by leaps and bounds
When I beat the ground, consider it a hulk smash
Sand man with the money i’mma up in the vault fast
So when you deal denim I am Radius
I got my hands on end like Octavius
When you’re trapped in America
And gotta wonder what woman as a carrier
In the VIP area you better keep it chill like Captain America!
I break barriers, a cyclops risen, a nightcrawler in the club won’t stop clicking
The plot thickens but soon you gonna see, that I nail every verse
I’m a mutant named wolverine
The Punisher from Queens knows that his enemies are hell bent on revealing his identity
Tune into the next episode, and find out that the next to blow
It's the kid who killed the game with the comic book flow!
There it goes!
Is that the kid?
Yeah, I’m the one with the comic book flow!
It’s my hero!
But who was that masked man?
