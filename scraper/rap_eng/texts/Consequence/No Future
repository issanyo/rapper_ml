[Hook: Consequence (Future)]
You ain't got no future (Nigga, you ain't)
You ain't got no future (Nigga, you ain't)
You ain't got no future (Nigga, you ain't)
You ain't got no future (Nigga, you ain't)

[Verse 1: The Audible Doctor]
You can feel the damage from the sonics
Honestly I just drop shit to watch 'em panic, the awkward
Moment they meet the prophet they know they can't profit off of
Can't even capture the monstrous flow, they call me Loch Ness
I'm a sonata suicide bomber honored to take the track to God with me
Thoughts get odder than Rob Ripley
I stop bein' suprised when I realize
They just tryna hold you down to capitalize like the shift key
Fuck, go head and miss me, you claimin' it's tight
But maybe on your next shot, make sure your're aimin' this right
The current tryna pull me under but I won't take that dive
Feelin' like fuck ridin' the wave, I'd rather battle the tide
Cause I'm, the rap precog, to de-clog
Your weed-logged vision thinkin' that you gon' be on
Just listen, we all know that the truth hurts
So here's a tip, just admit you ain't got no future

[Hook: Consequence (Future)]

[Verse 2: Consequence]
My first sense of business savvy
Was sayin' "Mind your business, daddy"
Once he found a Nike shoebox under my bed that was filled with baggies
Which had me writin' Dear Abby, I was that burned
Cause he threw it all away when my back turned
So like corrupt politicians on their last term
See these lies are why we ended up on bad terms
But I learned it's either horns or a halo
Yale or some yayo, dependin' how you choose
You'll get jail or a J. Lo, but me, I'll take the payroll
Cause way before the checks was in my savings account
And Jingles 2000 had hired Jamie & Mouse
I was the weed man who came to your house
Until the police van, it came so I bounced
And that's just a taste of the city life
They want me to bring it back like a CitiBike
And you already know what my city's ranked
So we revolt until I'm right around where Diddy's ranked
I seen these niggas tank like they're singin' next to Ginuwine
But like a pinstripe suit, I got plenty lines
That'll make your career go beddy-bye
Cause you ain't got no future...
