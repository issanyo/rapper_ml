I'm using Protools
Logic and Ableton
Just to recreate
What Rza made at Stapleton
A bunch of white labels
From White Zombie to Capleton
Cuz diggin in the crates
Is usually how my day begins
I'll take your favorites hymns
N chop em up wit "Funky Drummer"
I play to win
So it's gon be an ugly summer
So any Undercover
Posing as a drug addict
'll tell you I be cooking crack
The way I come at it
Yeah I been getting placements
Since the 90's and that's no jive
Back when Battery
Was 2 floors below Jive
And now a Goldmine
Is living on Hard drive
Unreleased Masters
That might just get you hard time
I got vocals from Pharell
2 Tracks from Ye
Demos from Dilla
Before he passed away
That's from
Way back in the day
Back when Master P
Was the Ice Cream Man
And stayed out in The Bay
You should stay out of way
You should stay out of the booth
Man you renting all them coupes
Your Instagram ain't the Truth
And your Hittas aren't shooting
So once they start shooting
You screaming its a Set Up
As if this the Quad shooting
What made start producing
Wasn't Pete or Premier
Son, Dre done caught a "Billi"
Selling "Beats" this year
So I'll be up in Platinum
Yellow gold and Platinum
Dropping that New Heat
Till they biting off
The Apple like Adam
And anytime
I'm in Record Plant
Record Execs
Can expect a rant
That's disrespectful
As Lil B trying disrespect
And even check Durant
It's the Bill Cosby of Crosby
Jungle City where Nas be
What you cutting
In The Cutting Room
Don't cut the mustard
You gon see
I go OD
Under hot lights
Since 50 Cent
And the Ja fight
So how dare
Any of you rappers
Try to rap after me
On NahRight
This that Stadium status
Up in Stadium Red
This that Stadium status
So don't play with that bread
