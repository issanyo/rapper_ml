You know I like it when you talk to me like that!
I used to take you...
This is Queens... and you know how we do it
In this streets I'm a f*ck...
And ain't none sweet like...
Because just when you thought I quit
Shit... call me a brand new lick
That I can't stop my rhyme...
I refused to get pinched by these crabby kids
But soon you'll open your eyes the way that... did
For all those dummy...
... believing what they see in friends
Probably won't believe until they see the prince
And enough evidence to know the same... ore the present tense
Without points they're running out of...
I guess the mind was right, you're running out of time!
Don't waste your time, pretty lady
Cause I won't allowed it baby
Unless you love me better than I love myself, self, self!
Don't waste your time, pretty lady
Cause I won't allowed it baby
Unless you love me better than I love myself, self, self!
Let's' go, now what's the...
But if you... bananas... Mississippi life...
You don't need body scanner, cause what I'm packing...
Cancel the flight that you had on your daily planner
My favorite band gotta be the Stars bangle
Cause I ain't standing for the fact that you ain't trying to mingle
... we should be making love from an art angle
Put your face in the pillow while you all tangle
You need a bodyguard, but not...
While we light a few cigars...
Cause I... the whole hose...
And between me and you, I'm not afraid that we've been out!
... cause you're too old to wipe your hair back and forth!
And I'm too grown to...
So before I touch your waist I get the OK!
OK, son this permission is...
Who is the best...
Every time a pretty girl rock
They all yell h my Gosh, please don't stop!
Don't waste your time, pretty lady
Cause I won't allowed it baby
Unless you love me better than I love myself, self, self!
Don't waste your time, pretty lady
Cause I won't allowed it baby
Unless you love me better than I love myself, self, self!
