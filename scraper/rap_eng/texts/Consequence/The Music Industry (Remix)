[Verse One] [Termanology]:
I ain't complain' about a label not signin' me
I just got signed, my people like, "Finally."
Took long enough but I ain't really sweat it
I knew I'd get me the cheddar, pathetic the way we spend it
Our relatives wouldn't let us invent a venomous record
Instead they'd rather have us check in college and get accredited
And then if we ever quit it I did it, stayed on my shit it
Delivered quality records regardless if they spin it
Shout out to real DJ's who always held me down
And let me get up on their show when I get in town
Let me spit a 16 and play that hot shit
Cause they in love with that real hip hop shit
Not for the profits and run up in they pockets
Jockin' all of these fly sick cats spittin' that nonsense
Consequence reppin' N.Y.C. now
Akrobatik he be reppin' for B now
5'9" he be reppin' for the D now
Crooked I reppin' killer Cali now
Fizzy Wo' still reppin' M.O.P. now
Termanology, I'll still kill you with a freestyle
