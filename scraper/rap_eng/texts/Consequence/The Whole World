[Chorus: Crozer & Consequence]
He's got the whole world in his hands
The whole world in his hands
And it's a cold world that takes the heart of a man
So go as hard as you can, as hard as you can
He's got the world

[Verse: Crozer & Consequence]
Oh, all of my heroes, all of my heroes have gone away
And left me, left me here ostracized
Left me here feeling compromised
That why there's a monster inside

[Chorus: Crozer & Consequence]
He's got the whole world in his hands
The whole world in his hands
And it's a cold world that takes the heart of a man
So go as hard as you can, as hard as you can
He's got the world

[Verse 2: Crozer & Consequence]
Oh, all of my faith has been drained
There's some fears I can't explain, I know it's time for change
A change in me, a change the world is about to see
Cuz I've been victimized, now they're gonna see the villain inside

[Chorus: Crozer & Consequence]
He's got the whole world in his hands
The whole world in his hands
And it's a cold world that takes the heart of a man
So go as hard as you can, as hard as you can
He's got the world

[Verse 3: Consequence]
Sister Abigail warned me bout them rabbit tails
And them horse shoes, and them court rooms
Damn, we're more doomed, than hawk and animal
To the point where history becomes annual
Nothing can be amical but when you tryna stop profit
Nah, they just label you as a false prophet
And claim that you talked into society
Then put their fbi's on me
I guess that the irony is destroyin' me from the inside
In it's  entirety will inspire me to untie this tyranny
So there's two choices, either hire or retire me
But don't no denyin' me, but both are wiser than a dynasty [?]

[Chorus: Crozer & Consequence]
He's got the whole world in his hands
The whole world in his hands
And it's a cold world that takes the heart of a man
So go as hard as you can, as hard as you can
He's got the world
