I'm dressed for success, put the glam squad to help with that
Told me stress wouldn't really go well with that
I've been to hell and back, check the flyer miles
You can't tell me jack when it comes to puttin' fire out
You need a firehouse filled up with firefighters
To reach this level requires more than 10 writers
And the same touch as Midas but things might go minus
If you ain't got a blanket agreement like Linus
Queen's finest, 'bout to blow in t-minus
The nicest, I's is like ISIS
That's cause I'm armed with bars like Ronda Rousey armbar
And I feed these bitches eggplant parmesan
It's bothers Cons you've been lyin' to the people
So I feel like Cosby with a cup of cappuccino
They makin' up stories, how they sold half a kilo
But we know how this ends if you ever saw Casino
To bet against me, you goin' broken AC
I got the fans makin' noise like a broken AC
So I should pay a broker's late fee
Cause every time I'm in the house I get the broken leg speech
Yeah Quence, break a leg
Just so you can plug me in later like Glade
But I ain't seen him since the 9th grade
And even back then he a cat I might shade
To say that out loud is the poor taste
But if you had a taste of bein' poor, that's the worst taste
Worse than a court case, worse than a divorce case
With remorse for the first date
I'll have you mean muggin' like North's face
I used to keep drugs in my North Face
And we'll win by a nose in this horse race
That's why there's more snakes than Cobra Command Center
That want to interrupt this grown man's dinner
See winners are born, bred and chosen
The best thing to happen to kids since Frozen
That's why my sideburns look like Logan's
Cause until you got bread like the Olsens
There's always other fish in the ocean
But imagine the commotion if I came home with a break baby
That could belong to me, Wayne or Wayne Brady
I know my main lady'll pull the trey pound
And it's about the same size as Cheerio in A Town
So it weighs down on me like a heavy rock
Now I sleep with one eye open like Fetty Wap
Every flock needs a sheep herder
It's just me and my sheep be eatin' at the Mercer
So unless your chain's heavy with a custom piece
You better do yourself a favor and tuck and release
