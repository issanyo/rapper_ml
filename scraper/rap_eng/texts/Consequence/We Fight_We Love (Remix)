{Kanye Verse}
Hip hop, uh
When i fight you fight
We don't fight fair
So i guess i'll see you in my nightmares
Just remember i made you like my Nike Air
Ye... Yeezys
Please be easy
To kill the animosity that's in the air
I'll touch every curve of your body like an urban degar(?)
And this wasn't no ordinary love
Our sex wasn't ordinary drugs
It's that crack, that crystal meth
I mean it gets so wet, i had to go in DEPTH
I mean the bitch so fresh i had to go in debt
Ru...running my credit card till there's no more left
Uh but that's cool, you wife and i'll be groom
I thought i hadda sign a seal like Heidi Klum (?)
Like Jay and Be
Like Chris and Ri
But this Christmas you'll be missin me
Q-Tip Verse
He walks outside for a cigarette break
And thinks how many cigarettes does it take
He takes a long drag with the sun in his eye
He squints, he thinks, he starts to sigh
Sometimes he cry
When he thinks about his girlfriend on his side
She held him down
She made him better
For the love fucked up weather (?)
And she thinkin about the life
With no more work just being the wife
But instead, her love she gave it to a man
Who fought against her lovely plans
So when she goes to work
Plus go to school
Plus fight for love she must feel like a fool
She want the ease to come after pain
She fights for love that's her campaign
Chorus
Word word yo
I try to stick it out with her through thick and thin
So whether she was thick or thin i was still stickin in
But like when i left homie with the rest of the friends
I guess all good things had to come to a(n) end
Instead of moving forward
She rather pretend like a tatoo artist (?)
I get under her skin
So she hatin on the kid
And its plain to see
I got her punchin at the screen
Like she playin the wii
She only think about me when her cash is low
And she heard my name brought up by them classy hoes
Cos she at the same nail shop where cassie goes (?)
And she up in the club with trash eagles (?)
And it start to drive her nuts like pistachios
Till i got the g shocked it like a casio (?)
The you shot yourself in the foot like blacks and co (?)
And that's too much drama so you had to go
Chorus
