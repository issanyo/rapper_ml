I'm doing roll repair, homie, I paid the way
Cause at a young age I learned that it pays to play
So when I step up, you should tell Rachel Ray
She might as well made this is far facial day
Cause I survived the blacklist and then the break away
So when you see my track listing, copy and paste away
Most of them waste away, until they decompose
I'd rather taste the paper and read the old
Double d's till every girl with double d's and bumblebees is asking me
Please could they trouble me? For a picture and autograph
Like golden... so I order lamb for all jokes... I'm at the throw with the none cause I rhyme like I'm trying to get some
And you rhyme like you might of missed a sign
You know the one that says stop chill, get off the next exit if you ain't got skills
Cause I'm a combination, a Russel brand, meets Russel's brand, the way I hustle fan
You get me around them Russians, another scam
You get them to the Greeks and we're gonna be, capischi?
Now get with the program and hear the same advice I give to Lindsay Lohan
If you ain't trying to go to jail for no man, then stay the f*ck away from the coke man
Division now, when they talk about the menace
The legacy I leave them make it worth every minute
Guaranteed by the time that we been this
Way you look back they're gonna say that we did it
We did it, you're damn right we did it
We did it, you're damn right we did it
We did it, you're damn right we did it
We did it, you're damn right we did it
Yo, whoever wrote me off should do comedy instead
Cause that's the funniest thing I ever read
I should have been dead and never made it to the future
I'm with the... but woke up as Freddie Kruger
So your worst nightmare ain't them lame intruders
But the one who gave you game and became your tutor
I took a... schooler and made him gang a mooler
Off the kids who were chasing fame and computers
Now that's what you call a social network
See only social cause he heard about my network
But if you want my social wanna do a check first
I get credit for coming with the best burst
The ex... and this is literal, how this slept on is almost criminal
Cause we're strapped in my mind it's so lyrical
Cause when I rap these rhymes are my miracles
So what's hysterical maybe see the sides splitting
You got a sound pitiful when I'm spitting
Alive and kicking, the post is there, you go to the pose it results Ã©clair
Victory, by land slide, you can run but you can't hide
Shit, they couldn't keep my hands tied
So disrespect me, just to keep your hands high, high, it's the cause for
Fifty years from now, when they talk about the menace
The legacy I leave them make it worth every minute
Guaranteed by the time that we been this
Way you look back they're gonna say that we did it
We did it, you're damn right we did it
We did it, you're damn right we did it
We did it, you're damn right we did it
We did it, you're damn right we did it
Yeah,.. holler somebody real before somebody real hollers at you
You know what the motto is
Don't play yourself, stay yourself
And most of all, make sure you cleared your debt with the dope man, or there will be consequences
It's the cause for
Fifty years from now, when they talk about the menace
The legacy I leave them make it worth every minute
Guaranteed by the time that we been this
Way you look back they're gonna say that we did it
We did it, you're damn right we did it
We did it, you're damn right we did it
We did it, you're damn right we did it
We did it, you're damn right we did it
