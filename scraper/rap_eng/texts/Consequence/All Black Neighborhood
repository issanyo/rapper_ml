[Intro: Consequence]
(Come on, man!)
(Come on)
Yeah
This what it felt like, when I grew up in New York
Mike Cash, what up?

[Verse 1: Consequence]
I want my kids to grow up in a all black neighborhood
Meanin' that nobody's in the red and the paper's good
Next to doctors, lawyers, the coach for the Hoyas
Maybe stockholders from Goya
The block'll destroy ya', so revolve in the morgue
But haters wanna see me with revolvers at my door
Use the same revolvin' door that Clark Kent used
A connoisseur, mostly Clark Kent shoes
Still abide by the park bench rules
'Cause hoes'll put you on the bench unless you park sum'n cool
Only a fool doesn't learn from they daddy lessons
And turn them shits into caddy
And dissolved apprehension was the app that I used
What I put on the map will more than likely be removed
Well I know you been confused about the future gettin' better
If you don't sound like Future, you get future endeavors
Well I'm back to the future and the view is gettin' better
And now, the reviews are gettin' better
Yeah, just ask Rolling Stone
You either rollin' or you stoned if you think I ain't in the zone
So I'm with my kids home in a all black neighborhood
Maybe down the block from Meagan Good
But you better make sure that that paper's good
'Cause every good girl wants a man to take her out the hood

[Chorus: Renee Neufville & Consequence]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
So she can sing like
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
And we can sing like
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Yeah
Oh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Yeah
Oh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Yeah
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's go
Oh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5’9”]
Yeah, yeah, black unity, black unity
I'm from the era of kangaroos and Max Juliens
I attended the public school in Starter coats
Swag jewelry, nothin' we never saw before
Cash rulin' me, listenin' to nothin' but Harlem notes
Carla gave me your number, I can't call her though
My phone off at the crib, I feel sorry for
Those who out here who livin' who hate to live
Old people told me that this is not the place that you should raise your kids (What you tell 'em?)
I said, "When I was a kid, shit, I was raised here"
Black neighborhood, carryin' this lady groceries
I'm walkin' but watchin' closely, I wish a hater would
Stories get told, lookin' at cold, empty courts
And torn hangin' nets
Where hoop dreams get deflated
And ain't no place like home
The only place you can go to stay and check, check
To that neighborhood
Community leaders bringin' gangs together for momentary moments of peace
Long as you know it's for that greater good
Black unity and black neighborhood
I just left from the barbecue, I just ate, I'm full
And now I'm ridin' around searchin' for Meagan Good
And she ain't turnin' me down because my paper good
Every girl around the way just tryna make it out the hood

[Chorus: Renee Neufville & Consequence]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
So she can sing like
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
And we can sing like
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Yeah
Oh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Yeah
Oh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Yeah
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's go
Oh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
