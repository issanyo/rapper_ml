(Intro: Kanye West)
Aww
Yeah, 9th Wonder on the beat (Aww)
I can't front man, you got some hot beats
It's your boy Kanye Tutta
Got Consequence in here, (I see now) Little Brotha (I see now)
Yeah, I want y'all to listen
Question.. (Aww)

(Verse 1: Kanye West)
Now how the hell I end up arguin' wit this bitch? (Aww)
Know everything, but don't know shit (Aww)
Kinda reminiscant of Anna Nicole Smith (Aww)
I just turn my music up like damn that's some cold shit (Aww)
I mighta known about a couple of months
Since then she gained a couple of chunks
She went from bein' a strobe light
To that old lady on Boomerang
Lady yellow ease I need no lights
And I swear she a riot folks
How she order all that food and a mothafuckin' diet Coke?
He said you lyin' yo, why is you lyin' yo
Cut it out quit it G, you hurtin' my kid-i-neys
Naw, she talkin' bout a couple of kids for me (Aww)
She hit and had a ring from Tiffany's
Right then and there I had an epiphany
I swear since that day I've been treatin' fat hoes differently

(Chorus)
Aww, I see now!
You was hurt and you on the rebound (Aww)
Ben & Jerry's and Mickey D's now
And you just gone gain all that weight on me now (Naw)
Naaw, fall back, (yeah) if I ain't a playa then what the hell you call that?
A nigga disrespect me I'ma be in all black
But baby if you let me I'ma take it all back

(Verse 2: Little Brother)
Look, I write verses do shows for a livin'
Hoes they look at me like everyday Thanksgivin'
Pete check how I'm livin', white T's free jeans
Shotgun and Capri's, big kike like Yao Ming
And it seems the style then how they go out they way
Just to prove they dedicated and devoted to Ray
I guess it goes how they say, that that pimp will repay
That's why I put 'em to the test like everyday
Not like a G.E.D. or an S.A.T. pop quiz let 'em know that they mil' ain't free
It's on like a college degree when you followin' me
Witout that entry level job there's a modelin' fee
So when I tell ya get 'em girl and you prove that you true
I let you bolt up on the block wit the rest of the crew
This just a couple of trials that we put 'em through
Let a nigga know now what you tryin' to do, for real

(Chorus)

(Verse 3: Consequence)
Yo fine date em, five star syllablis females
I hit em with deliverant styles for me to try to lay wit them (aight)
And then chill around the way wit them
Like her name was Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee and them
Spat game, wanna come to my ex-things
I keep 'em line like rollerblades at the X-Games
Fun Tina, but was the type the girl kinda stress things
Til' the album dropped now you thinkin' my rep changed (Ahh)
Look, we ain't sleepin' on the floor no more
But it's a strange misconception I ain't poor no more
That's bullshit, if they ain't payin' fuck a Promo tour
I rather keep my ass home and hit the porno store
So we hit the sex shop cause she wanted to get with me (aight)
Two shots of Yak she started actin' so giggily
Nine months later she went into delivery
And since then I treat my baby mama so differently, word (Oww)

(Chorus)
(Outro: Kanye West)
Yo I swear I'ma take this truck back man
I mean I got the new G5 whatever, that shit be in shop every 2 weeks
I told 'em.. I told 'em if y'all don't take this back and give me all my money back
And trade me in for the CL I'm gonna put it on this Little Brother song in 2 weeks
And they ain't believe me but.. Now I'ma let y'all know don't go out and buy the G5
I swear like it's a bad look for the girls, really they get in the car
And they always wanna look over and be like
"Aw nigga, yo check engine light on, it's on"
I'm like "ya top on, so we got 2 things we tryin to get off right here"
They don't like that
I take it back, I take it back, I just say it to get you maaad, I take it back
I could prove somethin' to you
Y'all been in North Carolina for 2 days, where the hoes at my nig?
