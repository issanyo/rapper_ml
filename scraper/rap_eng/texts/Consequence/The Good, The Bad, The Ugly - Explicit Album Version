"The Good, The Bad, The Ugly"

Yo you can keep asking them fuckin questions all fuckin day man
I told you what- I told you what the fuck happened man
Told your partner the same thing man, how long a nigga gotta stay here?

[Verse 1]
There was money on the table with the bricks
I was in the living room feeling on this bitch
Heard my car alarm goin off on my 6
So my dogs start barkin and some niggas hit the fence
So I take my dick out this bitch mouth and walked to the window
Pull the blinds down and took one hit of the Endo
You niggas ain't doin shit, but stealin my neighbors rims so
Walked back to the couch and told the bitch to bend over
That's what I'm rolling with..
Nah I ain't shit and I ain't snitching on nobody
Yea that's my .45, but it ain't got no bodies
And 2 dead niggas? Them is nobody..
They should've torched em, and you wouldn't had no bodies
I mean look at these pictures, just so sloppy
Couldn't have been me, I do my shit like John Gotti
Feed the nigga to the sharks after dark
Man fuck this shit I thought I told y'all
There was money on the table by the bricks
I was at the kitchen table choppin up some shit
Listenin to Jeezy and I heard a little (speeding car)
So I turned the radio down and cocked my 4 Fif, oh shit..
Am I hit? Nah just a hole in my Jordan fitted
So I turn down all the lights and cock my 4 Fif
Seen some niggas jump in they escalade and that was it
How much longer I gotta stay in this muthafucka?
Let me get a cigarette, I don't even smoke but shit y'all got a nigga stressed
I gotta stay in this muthafucka until I confess?
Shit, y'all bitches better get some rest
Cus it'll be a cold day in Miami
Before I snitch on myself or the hood, you understand me?
Ya I fuck with the Bulls but I ain't Sammy
Niggas run around the hood singin.. They should get a Grammy
And you two muthafuckas should get an Oscar
With this good cop bad cop shit.. Take me to process
Cus I don't eat breakfast with no pigs
I watched First 48 so fuck your 25 years
No evidence, no big. I don't know who split them niggas' wigs
Already told y'all, there was money on the table with the bricks
I was walkin to bathroom to take a shit
Then I heard my dogs barkin, there's some noise by the fence
So I ran to my room and reached for the 4 Fif
Then I seen three niggas by my back door
Looked out the bathroom window and seen two more
So I reached for my chopper and some clips out the drawer
Guess I had to welcome niggas to the gun store..
