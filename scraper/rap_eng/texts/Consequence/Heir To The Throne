[Verse 1: Consequence]
Everybody says, that my son is my spitting image
And now that he's spitting, you other rappers are finished
But before I had over the reigns
Rule number one: never had over your chain
Baby boy, you got big shoes to fill
You gon be the youngest dude to ever get a deal
On the real read the crop report
We the cream of the crop and on top of New York
And the fruits of my loins are from the same orchard
So once I pass him the torch I know he's gonna scorch'em

[Hook: Renee Neufville, Consequence & Caiden]
You are my
Heir to the throne
You Are My
Heir to the throne
I'm gon hold it down for real
You are my
Heir to the throne
You Are My
Heir to the throne
I'm gon hold it down for real

[Outro: Consequence]
So off we go let the trumpets blow
Let the trumpets blow
Let the trumpets blow
So off we go let The Trumpets Blow
But hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
