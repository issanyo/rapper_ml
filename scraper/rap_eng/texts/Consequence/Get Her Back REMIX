I'ma go get her cause I'm a go-getter
I know she so bitter that I probably owe her dinner
I probably owe her more than that for the way I did her
But what I got her from the jewelry store'll make her reconsider
And guarantee her girlfriends'll all throw glitter
I gotta get her back, get her back in Benz
I gotta get her back like I'm out for Revenge
When I'm out with my friends, they snap they fingers at Con
Cuz I hope she come back like a sneaker when it launch
Cuz I'm a sneakerhead who be sneaking in bed
Got caught sneaking around, sneakin' some head
Now there's voices in my head like the voices on The Voice
Saying "yo Cons, you mighta made the wrong choice"
I'm starting to the point like Yoda's ears
Cuz I miss seeing her in her Yoga gear
And I miss her asking what she's pose to wear
It got me feeling worse than Jhene Aiko
My exes keep texting, but they old news
And bout make me crash like I'm using Pro Tools
See old fools were once young in the game
If you end up by yourself, there's no one else to blame
No one else to name when you lying on your back
Staring at the ceiling wishing you could get her back
Wishing you could get her back
