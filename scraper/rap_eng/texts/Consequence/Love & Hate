Sugar, sugar, sugar
Sugar, sugar (Yeah)
Time is up I need sugar
Time is up I need sugar
Sugar, sugar
Time is up I need sugar
(It's the Cons nigga, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Time is up I need sugar

[Verse 1: Consequence]
Now let me tell you bout this chick who what that was my only love
The one that made me trip
The one that all my homies loved
But once it got thick I found that was phony love
Now she talking on the radio the (?) money love
Whoever told you love was a wonderful thing
Must have been a sucka for love who was under her scheme
But if love don't cost a thing then your girl is sterile
But if she come from Queens then she love dinero
Cause she come from the barrow saying that love is narrow
So she love more fellas so where that love don't affect shit
When out going on games so the love connects in
If your love is deaf then his gentle word right
And you ain't gotta question if it love at first sight
I keep my verse tight so you gon love the flow
Consequence for off off we don't love them hoes
Butter, you can blow an ounce of this come on

[Hook: Noora Noor]
Sugar, sugar, sugar
Sugar, sugar
Time is up I need sugar
All I need is sugar darling
Time is up I need sugar
Sugar, sugar
(T.P. side of the streets)
Time is up I need sugar
(We got mighty Son of Light, yeah)
Time is up I need sugar

[Verse 2: Son Of Light]
Now let me tell you what this trick who won and wasn't my love
Had me off my feet with a push and a shove
Burn with the chomp
She hot like all my verses get
Sharp with the art some shit you could get murdered with
And we the same but for real we different
Get it, she'd unsaid, forget it we both shifting
It's kinda funny, she gave me bones and a collar
It's like she out walking money and I followed them dollars
Of course I swallow my pride and die inside but it
Get past lows and highs and just ride with it
Get high with it, signed sealed delivered it
Your love must be up under your skirt because you're giving it
Sick of them things I stick to my ring cause you the
Trickiest as fling I spit it and win
To whoever said that hate was a despicable thing
It was the love that make you do all the ridiculous things

[Noora Noor]
All the things we had
Though we left the memories of what we were in
Good times turn the bad
The ring can fall in
Everyday was Love & Hate

[Hook: Noora Noor]
