[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Ayo, he pulled out his gun and started schemin'
Stood right there, blue trees in his space like police bleamin'
80, nothin' like these new born babies
Fresh off the recliner, guns squeeze, pay me
Hit an L, dynamic, move like I'm Wit and Dale
All of this is made like waves, I make sicker sail
There's niggas that rhyme and niggas that grind
That's my man, we only in the Benz that don't shine
Comparing me to money, suitted up Fila jumper
With the New Balance on I'm fine
The specialist, curly haired kids perpetuous
Slide in your bitch, give her dick that's treacherous
Catch me on leany, egged out, GreyGoosein' in the coupe
Callin' up Duke, come see me
Wise words givin', saw him in a flyin' spur
Givin' sign in the earth, lets work, nigga

[Hook: Kanye West (Beanie Sigel)]

[Verse 2: Consequence]
I used to wonder how people became stars and then return to their roots
Till I had to switch up the Cons, take a turn of the roots
Cause the fact they had Kwon out their CD changer
It must've been enough to turn my friends into strangers
Cause now they keepin' secrets when I'm in danger
And mirrors wise crack like god in the manger
But why should I name ya? I can speak to your conscience
You would feel the position that you see your boy Cons in
Cause now I'm on fire like the start of an arson
And even TV gettin' dinner like (?)
So the way I disappear right before Autumn hits
Or be like a magician like picked from the audience
And there goes the auto tricks to catch up to Rae
To somethin' smells fishy like the catch of the day
Make me grab a gun from my personal safety
But I'm the kind of person that won't keep it on safety, but...

[Verse 3: Havoc]
Really not much, I finna do rhythm
Get the fuck away from me 'fore I spit 'em
Purple drinkin' swag, but (?) in 'em
Nigga talkin' now like what now wit 'em?
First off, 9 outta 10 he snitchin'
Skurts when that thing starts spittin'
Now you tryna have feds at my door
Doin' dirty, cake way clean, cause I'm a boss
Colgate smile while your cocaine's foul
Somewhere chillin', burnin' hella dro down
(?) few and carried by 6
Just by 12 takin' court room flicks
After Biggie and Pac I was like word?
Niggas killin' rappers, I ain't tryna go dirt
Without even thinkin', leave a nigga on the curb
(?) myself these words...
