[Verse 1: Consequence]
Talking 'bout Cons get you karma
How are you a star trying to [?] drama
I know you police is dressed as Big Momma
Me, I'm dressed as Big Poppa
Versace, Versace's number one shopper
With a trailer full of girls so they screamin' out "Shabba"
And my joints knock harder, the Annie's theme
Say this is for the fans like antifreeze
As he reads off the manifesto
The magic is back, say presto
And I'mma pull a rabbit out a hat
Who looks like Jessica Rabbit from the back
Yeah, we the black skinheads
Pass me a pen and I'll turn into Pinhead
But only for big bread
You gotta [?] from a wire
This is the ambitions of a rider
Who is valedictorian
With the same ambition as Ralph Folarin
So I wear Ralph and I drive a DeLorean
It's a packed auditorium
So we take them to school
Gonna take them to [?]
And me and 'Ye back rocking
There must be new rules
New flows and synonyms
Strippers on the pole named Cinnamon
You better hide like Zimmerman
Cause you know who the winners is
Yeah, you know who the winner is
It's gonna be a cruel winter kid

[Bridge: Kanye West]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

[Hook: Kanye West]
Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Verse 2: Kanye West]

Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doing shit
Them niggas ain't doing shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathing you gasping
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready-ready for action

[Hook: Kanye West]

[Outro: Kanye West]
God! God! God! God!
