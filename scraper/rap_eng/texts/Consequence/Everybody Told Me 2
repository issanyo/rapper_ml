[Hook - Consequence]
Will you and GOOD Music ever (straighten it out?)
Will you and Kanye ever (straighten it out?)
Can you and Q-Tip ever (straighten it out?)
The game'll never be the same unless y'all (straighten it out)
It'll never be the same unless y'all (straighten it out)
Everybody told me to (straighten it out)

[Verse 1 - Consequence]
I could go the same route as Beans and attempt to apologize
Or turn the internet into Colombine
And explain to the people where the problem lies
When black people attempt to colonize intellectual property
And leave their mans without a pot to pee in
And that's a trait of Europeans
So I'mma bring back the term "skins"
Cause these 90 niggas are pussy
And don't wanna see another muthafucker wussy
You can talk about my gramma in your Tweets and shit
But if you go under your mattress, better squeeze the shit
Cause you can never revoke my past in these streets, you bitch
So hey sucka nigga, wherever you are
You don't wanna go to war with the cleverest star
Cause I leave nigga's careers with a better resolve

[Hook - Consequence]
Will you and GOOD Music ever (straighten it out?)
Will you and Kanye ever (straighten it out?)
Can you and Q-Tip ever (straighten it out?)
The game'll never be the same unless y'all (straighten it out)
It'll never be the same unless y'all (straighten it out)
Everybody told me to (straighten it out)

Nah I'm good

[Verse 2 - Consequence]
I can guarantee before the summer's up
That I'mma expose all these cover ups
The bingo hall, homie your number's up
Cause they don't put tiaras on the runner-ups
My little princess, victim of incest
Streets know the deal, so you owe me with interest
You should've been the best, but you home from jail
You might as well be the owner of the Oakland A's
Amber, Alexis and maybe even (ay!)
And a kid who dropped out of Yale to even be your stylist
Shit! You know who the wildest?
Your boy Cons to the Quence, cause I don't give a fuck
When it come to them checks
Nigga disrespect my set, you'll never make it out
Cause really, there's nothing else to straighten out
