[Intro: Consequence + Kanye West]
I hope you forget me not
Forget me not
I won't forget you ever, ever
Man I promise
After this remix
Forget Red Lobster
Cause I got reservations at Mr. Chow's tonight
And you can get any, and I mean anything that you want
Cause I'm about to bang 'em in the head with this paper
Word

[Hook: Consequence]
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, Quence let's go get 'em

[Verse 1: Consequence]
It wasn't until I got money, that I became a conscious rapper
Cause now I'm conscious of the fact of who they gon' go after
When they tryna find a back up for a team in the park
So they run up on my car before I can even park
But I guess there's no harm in hearin' out his proposal
But how you wanna stack and we aren't even social?
See this the kind of trash that if I choose to say no to
They gon' trash talk about me like a garbage disposal
And say that I changed like a dress rehearsal
And try to line me up with the intent to hurt you
But that ain't nuttin' more than a test of virtue
Cuz my promise to the hood is that I'll never desert you
For years I was swingin' at air
But then a wing and a prayer
Became the seats on the wing of a Lear
Yeah they kickin' theyself cause they should have stuck wit 'em
It's Cons to the Quence and you won't won't forget 'em uh

[Hook: Consequence]
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, 'Ye let's go get 'em

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When I finally get my first real money
Fuck keepin' it real, I'm gonna act real funny
Why? Cause these dudes try to Sanford and Son me
I, sit there and act like a big dummy
When, A&R's saw what they could get from me
I just do what B.I.G. said, go ahead get money
Had to humble myself just to play these beats
One of my side Geminis just reminded me
About, the two ways how you bein' your contact
They laugh for two days when they heard that Kan' rap
Cocky ass rappers ain't need no contracts
Now they fell off and they need a contract
Ha, it's funny how I got what I got
And I ain't never seen it get quite beyond that
Got a chip that won't quit, a grudge that won't budge
These niggas give you pounds and go in for a hug
Naw homie hold up
Naw dude slow up
Y'all ain't never show love
You ain't never know us
No nigga, no sir
Uh, I gotta bounce here comes my chauffeur

[Hook: Consequence]
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em

[Outro]
Since we made that money boy

Since we made that money boy
They say don't you forget 'em
Since we made that money boy
They say don't you forget 'em
Since we made that money boy
They say don't you forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
