[Intro: Consequence]
Yo, this Consequence
From the mighty Kon Man Clique
And I'm runnin' with my man Kanye West
And when I ain't got a pretty ho transporting a boy and a girl to the states
I'm either on the 1-9-2 or out in the Chi
So we gonna up y'all on how we chill, uh
Let's go

[Kanye West]
It cost Kobe seven digits to pay off Bridget
And get acquitted and break that bitch off, cause he ain't did it
Here go the Henny swig it, you know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin' in the cooler, break out the ruler, damn
Them the biggest tits I ever seen
We smokin' killer Cali gettin' weeded, make it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many B.I.s, so much inspiration

[Consequence]
I get inspired by the stunts too
I've run through (uh), so many bitches in one crew
That now they riff over bones to pick
Till I find one, and slide one
Take her home and quickly do this
I need not explain this
Cause Quence is famous for totin' stainless

[Kanye West]
Hey miss, who's there? No time to do hair
I'm through here, the show tonight, so get right
You look aight, let's club now
A rub down starts flavor while we grind in the theater
I'm tryin' to cut in the movies
I'm tryin' to give her something else to drink 'sides a smoothie

[Consequence]
Kids get broke when I take bank and win
With the gold chains, I throw game at your bitch like handball
Cause your boy's all that
So fall back, I be that real for '03 till

Chorus: Consequence & Kanye West
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till

[Verse Two: Consequence]
My mack game does me well
And makes them hoes want to go and kiss and tell
All of Quence's business, I cause dizziness
Any time I got to go and slap a silly trick

[Kanye West]
Yo, niggas is jealous cause we in drops
The cops wanna stop us about every four blocks
Cause what we smokin', them sacks got no seeds
And what they got in they pockets is no cheese

[Consequence]
When I'm postin' you better tell them hot heads, "Stay cool"
Or exit because I'm the exception to the rule
I'm reppin' through the dudes blocks with two Glocks
To bury ya; when they tear they ain't jammin'
Them cannons will make you drop
So I'm doin' sliffs of indo, showin' off for hoes
Basically, my ace has been makin' them sick tracks
While I was shootin' pornos with your wisdom

[Kanye West]
Now bring some more stacks before you ask
About the price of the tracks; the game on smash
Look, don't change the facts about these plaques
'Cause in fact, my freestyle hours over powers
Brothers can't hack it, sensitive to truth and mack bitch
'03 me, Quence and Plain Pat bitch

Chorus: Consequence & Kanye West
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
