[Chorus: Coko]
If you make a promise
I can see me being around
Know that I'm beside you
Promise you won’t let me down

[Verse 1: Consequence]
Since you the wife, you takes mine, I takes yours
Sun and Bourget, 40 states and brochures
Don't want a thing, baby girl, this all yours
Honeymoon nights make you mine on seashores
Model in glaze, and the, them finger waves
Me and Miss Thing doing duets in hurricanes
Eric Clapton songs, watch your world change
You headline my mine, got me stuck on front page
Gregory Hines, so mines tap by the bays
Bedroom wit'cha, long nights and short days
The way to keep you jonesin’ 'til the sun comes up
Mos def, girl, you got me love songed up
So, uh, did it so proper, let's keep this abrupt
I see you in the cut, boo-boo, so boo, get up
I see you in the cut, I see you in the cut
I see you in the cut, boo-boo, so boo, get it up

[Chorus: Coko]
If you make a promise
I can see me being around (I see you, you see me)
Know that I'm beside you
Promise you won't let me down

[Verse 2: Consequence]
Your boy met his queen bee, your first kiss tastes like honey
Love triangles of black burner jacks is sunny
Jeff Van Gundy, calling plays from Coach bags
Crucial Conflict, love they stack, take slow drags
Tryna ask Whitney 'why it hurt so bad'
Who riffin'? I got a planet for racks, just got bags
So many streets, shore to shore, I’m still fishin’
What kind of man would I be, now my dreams are mint condition
This love is a house, taking me home like Fox Brown
My boo, your words cut through with DJ's from Ghost Town
Slow it down, you know who you wit’, mami
Shock to your drive, Fashion Ave, and you got me
So keep falling, catch you with the arms of Montell and
Home again, don't be afraid to ring my Ricky Bell and
Whatever you selling, dirty girl, yo, I'm coppin'
I see you, boo-boo, so keep rockin’

[Outro: Coko]
Promise me (promise me) ecstasy (ecstasy)
And I'll be (and I'll be) devoted to you, be your wife now
Promise me (promise me) ecstacy (ecstasy)
And I'll be (and I'll be) devoted to you, be your wife now
Promise me (promise me, baby) ecstasy
And I'll be (and I'll be) devoted to you, be your wife now
Promise me (promise me) ecstasy (ecstasy)
And I'll be (and I'll be) devoted to you, be your wife now
