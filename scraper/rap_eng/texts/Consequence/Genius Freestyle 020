You wanna fight me but you won't fight your demons
Then wonder why ya baby mother's wiping off semen
I don't mean to seem like a sexist guy
But you can't stop a hoe from having sex with guys
So I'd rather be tested than testify
I'm the next in line to go from poor to Porzingis
So you really can't afford to point fingers
The boy from the cleaners peeps all game
First you wanna intimidate me with your keyboard game
Then you turn into Ciara at a Seahawks game
Well what you expect when the life you lead
Comes with more threesomes than Ice Cube's league
See I accept the fact that the camera's on me
And that's why I'm strapped, got the hammer on me
Even when I'm on the beach like Pamela Lee
Or when I hit up Gucci like Angela Yee
I demand that my fee be more when they pay up
My fresh game got 'em all talking 'bout the Lay Up
Straight up I'm giving out Mitch Greens
To anybody think it's something sweet about Queens
I was getting two thousand
For a 16
Now I'm killing more niggas than 2016
So Rest In Peace to my peers
And the parking lot
I'm here to silence the critics that do nothing but talk a lot...
Cuz I ain't bat a lash over all this backlash
I just came in for the cash
And to have the last laugh
Cuz he who laughs last laughs the hardest
You don't know how many days I walked around Target
Safest place to be when you walk around a target
Now I'm in the place to be and I got the people talking
But forget all the back and forth
Cuz my girl needs a brand new bag to sport
It should be brand new and heavy
Like the Brand New Heavies
Yeah them hashtags were petty but I'm back and I'm ready
So even if you live on IG
It doesn't mean you as live as I be
I see Ima need your IP address
Just so I can prove you be hating like the rest
Forget a statement to the press
When it comes to rank
The only one you need to see
Is the one from the bank!
