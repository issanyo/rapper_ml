Ayo
Planes, trains, automobiles
The G500s with the auto-roll wheels
Pinot Grigio, got 'em on chill
See now, see me ho? I got that deal
If you tryna build, I bet you'd like to know that
My father was a Black Panther with Geronimo Pratt
And back in college, I ain't run with no frat
I just ran with the track that put the Chi on the map
Now the Roc in the buildin', UIC Pavilion
Two years ago I was just a civilian
Now every chick in here swear I got millions
In area codes with unidentified children

Hold up, I'm fuckin' up the rap

Every chick in here swear I got millions
In area codes with unidentified children
Put my hoodie on, blend in like a chameleon
Hear barbershop talk, niggas try to kill him
Take my hoodie off, they like "Ye waddup, you chillin'!"
Swear to god they just like children
Just like high school, back at my school
Just like Halloween minus the costumes
The niggas that's flickin' was the ones that's trickin'
The girls two seatin' was the ones that's treatin'
Do a test on relationship, everybody cheatin'
I used to want the Jordans that's most recent
Now I throw Jordans on the whip just to look decent
Just to get pulled over by the precinct, so frequent
It's like I'm back bein' a delinquent
They wanna know where I live, stay, and work
Why a young black nigga get all these perks
How I stack my paper, got Adidas in every flavor
Excuse me officer, I don't know Rod Laver
Or Stan Smith, what they don't understand is
How I got that color in canvas
