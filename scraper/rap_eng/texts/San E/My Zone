I barely go past 170cm
I’m not even 60kg, I’m an anchovy
I’m ugly and I’m a pussy
So instead of Show Me The Money
I fit in better at Unpretty

Success stories of famous people
Gave me an inferiority complex rather than hope
Even I think I look so pathetic in the mirror
I’m gonna be more successful than you

My shoes smell like bad foot odor
That just means that I ran without resting
I tell myself every day as I look at my sneakers
Yeah, nothing’s impossible, I tighten my laces

Dreams cost me a lot of debt
Give me back my money
I wanna go over a billion and get a trillion like a gardener1
I’ll chase after my dreams that are running away
I wanna keep evolving, like a firetruck in front of a fire2

I’m in my zone get out out out
I’ll steal it all, even your soul, grratata
The best you can do is just that
Block block block
Just shut up, shut up, shut up
Dak dak dak

Show me the money
Even if I get kicked off
I won’t ever cry
I’m different from the impatient ones
You’re a penny, I’m a dollar
Difference of rate, difference of level
I’m a leader I don’t follow
You’re a drum washing machine
Just suck on (wash) my rap

I ain’t new to this
I’m a senior to most these kids
I’m a superstar Monday to Sunday
We’re not friends, we’re competing all day
It’s war all day, no pain no gain

Woo, no one expected this
Ask me wooh
Where have I been all this time?
They all whisper, who is that?
My future too bright
Stronger than “Building Owner Flow”3
MicroDot

I’m incredible I’m so dope
Don’t need a contract no more
I tell you you’re good and your head inflated
Hyung please calm down
Why can’t you be real?

I’m in my zone get out out out
I’ll steal it all, even your soul, grratata
The best you can do is just that
Block block block
Just shut up, shut up, shut up
Dak dak dak

A rapper or a corporate man, I’m lost
Honestly, I don’t like anything other than rap
I promise you, you’re gonna suffocate soon
With the real shit, killer killer killer
Ready to kill shit

They say I’m a married man who worries the upper people
In order to become a super star
But open your eyes and look, it’s crazy in here
All you around me, watch over me, hurry hurry hurry

Who wants to fuck with me
Nobody ’cause i go H.A.M
Hard as a muthafucka
Everyone hates me
I’ll be a superstar this coming October
Mnet has raised another lion

Lee Chul Joo kills em all like it’s his job if they interfere
My brothers. My homies uh
If you become my enemy
My bro homie. who?
Hey fuck that shit

My zone, I’m in my zone
Don’t step in my zone
I’m in my zone, I’m in my zone
Get out my zone

I’m in My zone, I’m in my zone
I wanna see Swings back home
I’ve stayed on my grind
Been on my grind
I wanna see E-Sens shine

I’m in my zone
I’m in my zone
Don’t step in my zone
I’m in my zone
I’m in my zone
Get out my zone

My zone, zone, zone, yuh
My zone, zone, zone, yuh
My zone, zone, zone, yuh
My zone, yuh
