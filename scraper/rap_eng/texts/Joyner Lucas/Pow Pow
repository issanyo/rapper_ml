[Sheen Phillips]
My flow is like Veteran's Day
Well respected of course
Either accept it or get wetted and sprayed
I got shelves and i'm up in your face
With bullets forging your knowledge
You gotta learn how to live with an open mind
I quick to pull a 9 and bust your appendix
Schizophrenic forensics
Watch you mouth. Guns will kill your opinion
A millis is itchin knock of stiches
Phillips is MVP
