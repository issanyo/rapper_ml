[Joyner Lucas]
I wash my dick in a pool with some Dove soap
So tell them rappers who want to battle me fuck no (fuck no)
I was born and raised in a pool of aids with a cutthroat
And now I'm bruised and pained and losing veins till my nuts blow
I'm not a fan of the blunt
I tried to smoke i was damaged for months (true)
Carry hammers like I'm starving bitch hand me your lunch (give me it all)
Better answer me when I'm talking you hear me or what? (huh)
Do you understand me or what? (Answer me)
I wanna hire a hit man to kill rappers for fun
Half now to do the job and the other half with his gun (nigga)
At high school you was the man always yapping your gums
Now we look at you like 'damn fuck happened to son?' (fuck happened to him?)
I'm bad for your son and your daughter's mama (yeah)
Before i die i need a hard recliner, two lesbian dikes with soft vaginas and brains as smart as china
I'm kind of a misfit I don't hide all my business (nah) and I'm probably going to hell since i told God my religion is really no competition (nope)
I deserve to best, only reason I'm not on top is cause they ain't heard of me yet (true)
I get it then go I'm putting you niggas in holes it's surgery rest
And get ready to blow [?] i murder these steps and emergency jets on my third lightyear I'm not an angel it's the purge right here I'm not a rapper I'm your worst nightmare
I'm not -
