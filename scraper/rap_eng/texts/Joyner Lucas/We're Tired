[Verse 1: Cory Hueston]
Everybody wanna take control
Wanna take my money, tryna steal my soul
I'll be the one to let you know
When the shit goes down, I'll be digging out holes
Right now, there's a different conversation
So please don't take it personal
I don't know what the world's been missing
But I think we need a miracle

[Chorus: Cory Hueston]
I'm tired of being held down
And I'm tired of watching these people die
And we're tired of being let down
And we're tired of watching all people die

[Verse 2: Cory Hueston]
Nobody wants to do what they're told, yeah
Someone pull the trigger on someone they don't know
Shots fired, let the people sing, yeah!
Don't forget that we're all human beings
And we've been climbing up this mountain way too long
For way too long

[Chorus: Cory Hueston]
I'm tired of being held down
And I'm tired of watching these people die
And we're tired of being let down
And we're tired of watching all people die
We're tired

[Bridge: Cory Hueston]
What if we come all together and
Stop taking children from their mothers and
Stop hiding all the evidence
Everybody sees what it is
What if we all come all together and
Stop taking children from their mothers and
Stop hiding all the evidence
Everybody sees what it is

[Verse 3: Joyner Lucas]
Joyner
Gotta live, tired of this
First they try to hold me back and then they try to tie my wrist
I love it how they put me down and act like I do not exist
Like I been out of breath and I've been kind of stressed
And the divided mess, what, they forgot to pest
Yeah, I'm tired of runnin', tired of strugglin'
Tired of always being tired of something
Tired of the system always lyin', bluffin'
While the police do a whole lot of nothin'
Want to kill us all, by the dime a dozen
Tired of starin' at the Bible, wonder when God comin'
Got my mind runnin', I'ma die hustlin' nigga

[Chorus: Cory Hueston]
I'm tired of being held down
And I'm tired of watching these people die
And we're tired of being let down
And we're tired of watching all people die
I'm tired of being let down
I'm tired of watching these people die
We're tired
