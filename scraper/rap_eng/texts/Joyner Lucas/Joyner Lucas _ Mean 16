That RapFest shit/Yo yo yo yo yo/For 25 years of my life I been peer pressured/I hold a weight that’s so over weight I could scare Precious/I stick my middle finger up at you with hand gestures/So fuck you, you would think I'm Scarlett Johansson hair dresser/Even Yusen Bolt can't catch me, your pants stretch/New rappers are transgendered all smothered in ranch dressing/I been sworn into secrecy demons with mere blessings
/Who speak to me through tradition passed down to my ancestors/Swallow Klonopin and choke  you just incompetent
You faggots ain't your self you just a Miley Cyrus twin/
I should make your conscious spin, you ready to suffer the consequence/I literally knock you tonsils literally loose and rip your pockets thin/I’m profiting.  Johnny cook a Cocheran inside of him, I gotta win/Moving up living on top of him and I’m rocking rims like stock a tin/Not a fucking pot to piss or pot to pitch/ if Pac was living I’d probably be poppin wit him/ god forgive me I’m just Joyner
