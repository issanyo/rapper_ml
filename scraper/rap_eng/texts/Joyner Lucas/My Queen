[Chorus]
I want you you know that
If you feel like I do thats the sign and we should get
Down
Let the people think what they want I don’t care we are meant to be
Everyday I want to think off you im in love
My queen
[Verse 1]
You know I you know I love you like cooked food
You know I need you like gravity in outer space
You know I need you keep me in a good good mood and you don’t even get mad when im out of place
I love you like a fat killer ok
And thats what 50 said and even if im down to my last 50 cent then baby its all yours
You love it when I get a aggressive like a small forward
I tell you I tell you how much I need to see you
You make a nigga wanna make a pledge allegiance to you
And if you ever home alone don’t be scared to call
Wish I could plant you and grow a whole field of yall
And ya mama think im crazy uh huh
But if she got to know maybe even she would wanna date me
And she used to choke
And you know I love your smile too
And your good enough to be alive cause you sound true
I think I found you
[Bridge]
(I found you ,I found you ,I found you ,I found you)
Yeah I think I found you
(I found you I found you I found you I found you I found you)
[Chorus]
I want you you know that
If you feel like I do thats the sign and we should get
Down
Let the people think what they want I don’t care we are meant to be
Everyday I want to think off you im in love
My queen
Your my sun don’t leave it just begun
My queen
Your my sun don’t leave it just begun
[sample]
Sometimes walking away is the most constructive thing you can do ,because you are showing them the consequences of their behavior
And if they actually want to interact with you
The they will have to change to be more compatible with your frequency in order to get you back in their reality
So sometimes the best way is to disconnect from someone who is of an incomparable vibration than you
Does that make sense to You?
But that may be the last resort
You may have to do that and recognize it as the most compassionate thing that you can actually do because you are showing them what the consequences of their behavior is on you
However
You always have the opportunity to reflect to someone what you believe their vibration is doing
Most people in that sense who are
Projecting on others are simply projecting their own fears about themselves on to others of their lack of power or lack of connection lack of belonging lack of self  worth and are projecting it onto others to distract them selves from having to look at that belief within in their own (?)
