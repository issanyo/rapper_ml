[Interlude]
The worst hell you can be in is the hell you don't know you're in
You understand?
So, having a negative ego, in a sense, is it's own punishment, even though they think they're being rewarded
Because at some point, at some point, somewhere in the structure of their existence they will be able to recognize what that energy did to them at that moment and they will experience the consequences of that state of being
So everything you do has a consequence. Somewhere along the timeline of your existence, you will experience the consequence of every single choice you have made
And again it's not a punishment, it's just a reflection so that it can guide you in getting in touch with who it is you really do prefer to be and perhaps, even more strongly, who it is you don't prefer to be
