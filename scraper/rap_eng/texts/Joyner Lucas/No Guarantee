[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
And I always dreamed of having that Lamborghini
Till a nigga done seen that price tag
So for now I guess it's just me in that hoopty
And that sucks bad
But til I get rich its just me and my bus pass
And I love rap
But If I could, I be
On top of world where they watch me
With a brand new chick cause the one that I'm with, wanna play more games than Yahtzee
She a One Oh Six, that's Roxy
No smoke, no dro, no broccoli
No sticks, no stems, no parsley (Shit)
No cribs, no bibs, no car seats
Don't hold your breath I'm cocky
All white lets dress like Nazi
I'm so so def like Foxy
Let's step like Bobby
But don't go just yet, just try me
Just us, no eye like Visine
Bet we won't stop like Molly
And I'm so so fresh like Andre
And lets do this shit for Tom's sake
Can you handle the fun?
I just wanna be your man for the month
Ask your niggas, don't care for the front
And that's no lie, I won't stop
Red fox like [?] to the sun
And I know why, love kills so don't put your hands on a gun
Back when a nigga ate Ramen Noodles, I was snug
Watching niggas get all kind of love
Shit, I didn't really know what time it was
I was rocking [?] had yamaka's
Thinking I'm a stud, local nigga with no kind of bud
Just a strategy
Even though I had a thing for you, I knew there was no guarantee

No guarantee, no guarantee, no guarantee, no guarantee
No, no it ain't no guarantee
I said "Ya'll couldn't afford Drake on this record, so I said 'Fuck it I'll be Drake for this one"
But there ain't no guarantee

But I can guarantee this!
That I'll be on that East Coast nigga shit, fuck what you heard
I'll be on that East Coast nigga shit, fuck what you heard
I'll be on that East Coast nigga shit, fuck what you heard
I'll be on that East Coast nigga shit, fuck what you heard
(No guarantees!)
I'll be on that East Coast nigga shit, fuck what you heard
