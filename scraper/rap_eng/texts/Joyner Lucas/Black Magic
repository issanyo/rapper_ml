[Verse 1]
I like this feeling
Yo Q turn me up just a little bit
Yeah just a little bit
Alright I'm ready lets go
I got 'em bitching, I'm focused
Back and forth from coast and I backstroke and I'm floating
All up in your bitch ocean, I don't think this should be insulting
Drink the juice from my glow stick, don't call me back i'm groaning
But thanks for buying my posters, I fucked around and get twisted
Strait Tequila gon' burn and I write 16's and murder that sick shit
Waiting for my turn, I'm doing this shit since I was an infant
Way before I had sperm, yeah that's the definition of an addiction
Fuck these niggas gonna learn
And I got this bad bitch she a brain buster, I don't care if Lil' Wayne fucked her, I beat her down and get brains from her then kick her out cos I can't trust her
Fuck the Benz mother fuck can't drive, and fuck the party I'm staying in, but when I get rich you'll see me whippin' it'll probably be something Bruce Wayne was in
It'll probably be something that Jay Z in
It'll probably be something Kanye be in
King size bed in the back seat, something that I can make a baby in
Wait hold up, hold up, hold up
Way too much kool aid in your heart valves
If I was you then I'd die now, jump out the window like Ron Brown
So

[Chorus]
What you, what you, what you want?
What you niggas want?
(?)
Give you want you want
Man this that Chris Angel, that Houdini, that Bum Diggy
Now fuck with me, that black magic
That same shit that made your bitch fall in love with me
What you, what you, what you want?
What you niggas want?
(?)
Give you want you want
Oh yeah this that Copperfield, that David Blaine, that Bum Diggity
Now fuck with me, that black magic
That same shit that made your bitch fall in love with me

[Verse Two]
Now
I don't need no crew with me, I'm solo
