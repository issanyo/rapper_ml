I dont wanna wait for nobody

Don’t be scared don’t you worry
I don’t wanna wait for nobody
I just wan dance with you mammy

Don’t be shy don’t you worry

[Hook/Chorus]
Too much juice, too much sauce
Too much sauce, too much juice
Too much juice, too much sauce
Too much sauce, too much juice
Too much juice,too much sauce
Too much sauce, too much juice
Too much juice, too much sauce

[Verse 1 – Joyner Lucas and Ycee]
Yeah, now if I wait for you
I ga' wait for e'rybody
Way too much Juice
She gon tell your friends about it
You know who I am
I know you don heard about me
And a nigga with the sauce
Ain't mean no teriyaki
I just walk up in the party with you girl, arm around me
Booty so fat, that she gotta walk around it
I'm so popular, everybody talk about me
And I know you wanna fuck me
Or at least you thought about it
If you thought about it
You just wanna made it, aii
I think you should lemme hit it, aii
I need you to make a decision
Something bout you got me wishing
With just me and you in my kitchen
Do you pray too, am religious; I need that
Jah, the way you naked, baby I just wanna see that
When you put it on me;
Love the way you tell me real that
(i love the way you tell me real that)
You don't really drink, but you wanna take gray shot
(She wanna take three shots; she wanna take three shots)
You gon be ma baby mother, amma be your baby father
Tell me something in'a your hid out
When we dancing, I just wanna put your fucking skirt off
If I take it easy, you be saying 'go further'
Every time I made it, you be mad out
Baby I don't wanna hurt ya
But a nigga feel like he don't deserve ya; one desire

[Pre-Hook/Chorus]
I dont wanna wait for nobody
I just wan dance with you mammy
I put my hands on your body
Don’t be scared don’t you worry
I don’t wanna wait for nobody
I just wan dance with you mammy
I put my hands on your body
Don’t be shy don’t you worry

[Hook/Chorus]
Too much juice, too much sauce
Too much sauce, too much juice
Too much juice, too much sauce
Too much sauce, too much juice
Too much juice, too much sauce
Too much sauce, too much juice
Too much juice, too much sauce
Too much sauce, too much juice

[verse 2 - Ycee]
This your waist, am still liking this your waist
When I put up with the Bar Man outside
You know we don't really wanna play- no
Too Much Juice, Too Much Sauce
Too Much Sauce, Too Much Juice
Gat Real-Gs in ma crew
Not those ones that gat you confused
Hennessy in my Soda, I don't roll with em Cola
We be bursting, I told ya
Stunts that gat you dripping like water
Hundred bandz, on ma sleeves, we be living my dream
Yeah I know you've seen a lot of boys
But there's no Don, no Don no Don like we
This your way gat me thinking about you all day
No be play, right now you gon really pay
Take you out no bogoriga; gat balls like a bubble bee
Honey, lemme talk to you
I gat Juice, I gat Sauce; its a barbecue girl
Wait for nobody, I just wanna dance with you mami
Oh yea, I put ma hands on your body
Don't be scared, don't you worry
