[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Damn, this is not alright
How the fuck I end up on the other side of life?
No more hangin' with my friends, no more ridin' bikes
No more brushin' barbies hair, no more flyin' kites
No more school, no more learnin' for me
No more youth, no more juice
No more hula hoops or Suzy Q's
Wish I could kiss my momma bye (Joyner)
And if she ever see me like this, she'll be traumatized
No this is not alright, but nothing is (shit)
I barely got to live, I'm just a kid
Look at me, look what you fuckin' did
I'm fuckin' dead (damn)
No this wasn't even my fault, now I'm speaking with the lights off
I don't think they hear me
It ain't no more TV, no more dancin'
No more sleepovers or no candy, no more campin'
No more kisses from my daddy 'cause I left and died
All because this stupid bitch wanted to text and drive

[Chorus: Jade Novah]
Smash time, watch the glass fly
Ain't no way, ain't no way you can go back
Float away, float away, float away-ay-yeah
We're frozen in this moment
Ain't no way, ain't no way you can go back
Float away, float away, float away-ay-yeah

[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]
Auto pieces, oil leakin', drippin' gasoline
Door is open, windows broken, glass shattered dreams
Holy bibles, open beer bottles at the scene
Now look at us
No more comin' home from work and cookin' dinner for my man
No more prayin' for my sins, no more stuntin' on the 'Gram
No more Thanksgiving holidays or pictures with the fam
No more vacation plans to everywhere I've never been
It's all gone now
Look what you did (look what you did)
Damn
I should have never got inside your car
I should have stayed at home or just went shoppin' at a different store
I should have waited or just called an Uber, but I live too far
No more tantrums and ain't no more questions, no more answers
No more homework with my daughter, no more second chances
No more baby in my belly, sad to say we died
All because you choose to drink and drive
Why?

[Chorus: Jade Novah]
Smash time, watch the glass fly
Ain't no way, ain't no way you can go back
Float away, float away, float away-ay-yeah
Frozen in this moment
Ain't no way ain't no way you can go back
Float away, float away, float away-ay-yeah

[Verse 3: Joyner Lucas]
I've always been a one for challenges and different thrills
Open alleys while I'm speedin', that shit gives me chills
Hittin' corners, ridin' fast and that shit's really real
My momma always said if I don't chill that shit gon' get me killed
It's too late (too late)
I say goodbye
No more drivin' reckless thinkin' I won't pay the price
No more taking life for granted I just wasted mines
Oh my god, I just died tryna race and drive

[Chorus: Jade Novah]
Smash time, watch the glass fly
Ain't no way, ain't no way you can go back
Float away, float away, float away-ay-yeah
We're frozen in this moment
Ain't no way, ain't no way you can go back
Float away, float away, float away-ay-yeah
