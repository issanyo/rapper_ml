K-K-Kato on the track bitch

[Verse 1]
I got a girl, She dope as hell
She wear that Gucci, That Louis, Chanel
Shorty so right can't even deny
Booty so fat you can see from the side
I'm just a guy, I'm just a man
Lotta things 'bout me she won't understand
I think I'm so used to being alone
Now i have urges to cheat on the low
No, It ain't cool
No, It ain't life
No, I ain't saying that shit is alright
But it was only supposed to be once
Now I got more than one chick on the side
Feel like a dick
Feel like a cheat
Wonder how'd I feel like if that was me
Knowing they fearing, I know that It's wrong
Ain't no excusing I feel like a dog

[Pre-Chorus]
Then my phone rings (phone rings)
Got me on some code names (I'm so ashamed)
Now my girl looking at me so strange (say i won't change)
Oh na na
Late night with my lover, staring at me oh

[Chorus]
And I think she knows
Yeah I think she knows
And I think she knows
I think that she know whats up
I think that she know whats down
Yea I think she knows

[Verse 2]
I must admit
Real mixed emotions that i gotta fix
When she at work I be losing my mind
Feeling like she know the truth and I'm blind
Taking my time, I got a plan
Plus I'm afraid that she won't understand
If she found out then I'd be on my own
Fighting these urges to cheat on the low
No, It ain't real
No, It ain't cool
No, I ain't saying that this is the move
But it was only supposed to be once
But that one night just turned into a fuel
I'm such a dick
Feel like a G
Wonder how'd I feel like if that was me
Knowing they fearing, I know that It's wrong
Ain't no excuse though I feel like a dog

[Pre-Chorus]
Then my phone rings (phone rings)
Got me on some code names (I'm so ashamed)
Now my girl looking at me so strange (say i won't change)
Oh na na
Late night with my lover, staring at me oh

[Chorus]
And I think she knows
Yeah I think she knows
And I think she knows
I think that she know whats up
I think that she know whats down
Yea I think she knows

[Bridge]
Phone rings (phone rings)
Got me on some code names (I'm so ashamed)
Now my girl looking at me so strange (say i won't change)
Oh na na
Late night with my lover, staring at me oh
I've been so selfish, I've been so blind
I feel so stupid, I don't know why
I got a good girl at home
And I know she love me so much
And she know I'm up to no good, no good

[Chorus]
And I think she knows
Yeah I think she knows
And I think she knows
I think that she know whats up
I think that she know whats down
Yea I think she knows
