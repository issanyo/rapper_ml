[Intro: Kyle Bent]
We just chilling
We just vibing this one hell of a time
Go tell your girlfriend, tell her girlfriends
They can all come and slide

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
I say, fuck how they feel
Bitch, Imma eat and then leave you the bill
I'm from the east, my OGs in trill
Who got the keys to my jeep in the ville
I set it off now they call Ms. Cleo
Please call your freaks about 3 and let's chill
They suck so good, I fell asleep at the wheel
Hoe I'm on fire let's grease up the grill
I don't need a home meal
I just need me an appetizer
Enchilada
Some burgers
A half of lobster
And a pasta
You swerving
Just ?
Avacado
I'm serving that crash and driver
Passed the lines
In the Carolina
I got ties and I'm back on ya back behind ya
If I die, I come back as an anaconda
Swallow all of them, pause
Ok, I think they must got me fucked up
What's up
It's hard for these hoes to trust us
Uhuh
I ain't shit
I think I'm probably the blame now
Or the reason why she done with game now
I ain't shit
What happened to me?
Nigga what happened to you?
You used to have it your way
Yeah, you used to be the man back, back in the day
Back, back when 'ye had the backpack and the shades

[Chorus: Kyle Bent]
We just chilling
We just vibing this one hell of a time
Go tell your girlfriend, tell her girlfriends
They can all come and slide
You like my style, you like my aura, I can see in your eyes now
That you really like the boy, but what you like more's my lifestyle
Oh yeah
We don't do nothing less its about progressing our minds
You can't hang with us if you just want a piece of that pie
Nah, I ain't tryna fit in, talk it, I live it, man that's my style
Ya'll talk about who did it, they ain't in the picture, man this right now

[Verse 2: Kyle Bent]
They finally hip to the plan yeah
Back then they ain't understand
I guess the vision was just made for one man yeah
The power was all in my hand
I start the wave man im the new poseidon
Moving through the stages, yeah its cool im rising
My whole life is racing flying through the mileage
Tryna raise the wavelength get in tune with knowledge
Yeah this life's amazing
And honestly what u make it
Treat it like putty you gotta shape it
The blessings are plenty and for the taking
The dreams they be petty u gotta chase em
Can't ever slow down man you gotta pace it
Success be so sweet that you gotta taste it
For your own satisfaction and entertainment
Never for the hatred or the dollar faces
Ladies now a days they be asking me
What your hair color, blond or green?
Honestly the world may never know
Money on my mind turned to pots of gold
On this glory road
And my whole team they gon' roll for sure
Homie Monni he gon' roll that pasta sto
Light it up like the pots on a stove
See how high we go

[Chorus: Kyle Bent]
We just chilling
