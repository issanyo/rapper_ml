(Verse 1, Snax)
Growing up, she ain't have much
She always felt like she was never enough
Her mama used to call her a slut
Her daddy used to call her a whore
The pain was just too hard to ignore

She had a crush on the boy next door
He made her feel like she's something that you gotta adore
And he ain't like her, he just likes that her body's mature
See he ain't even seen a naked body before

She gave it up, gave into the lust
Thought it was love but found out she got fucked

Now he don't text her, won't pick up his phone
She chills with her friend, yet she still feels alone

Depression starts eating her thoughts, she feels so lost
Wishin' the pain would just stop

Anxiety killin' inside
Like she being choked she can feel all the lies
She just wanna cry

See nobody ever there for her
Nobody ever care for her

And she'll probably never trust again
Cause that boy went and fucked her friend
Uhh

(Chorus, Snax)
She took that blade and put it to her vein
She tried to take away her pain

She closed her eyes and fell straight to sleep, (damn)
That cut's too deep

(Verse 2, Diri)
Hot price due to daddy, the life that she was livin'
Such a beautiful life that she was given

In her room jammin out to her rock, she felt stricken
How could you have all this and still feel something's missin'?

She went to school with all her usual friends
When introduced to someone new, unlike her usual friend, so different
You could, completely tell'em apart
She didn't dress the same
And wasn't worried, she was smart

At first she was jealous
And had a complex
Because for her fitting in was a contest
She gave up her body plenty of times
But this girl live life for love and it wasn't a conquest

So she befriended her
Tightly but mentally
Had plenty of other intentions with a man to be
Got up in her mind when she figured out the second he found out she was holdin' on to her life so slightly

She planned it out
But didn't think the damage out
To cut the girl that giving herself, you couldn't bandage out

Racin' for the pain
Innocent girl slain
Since she couldn't live with herself, she took away her pain

(Chorus, Snax)
She took that blade and put it to her vein
She tried to take away her pain

She closed her eyes and fell straight to sleep, (damn)
That cut's too deep (joyner)

(Verse 3, Joyner Lucas)
See i didn't mean to play'em
It was outta my hands
I loved one cause she made me feel like high to my planes
I loved the other cause she made me feel proud of my sins

Even though i was sneakin' around and lied to my friends
You say i want my cake and eat it too
And i admit it i was tripping, they could see it too
I told shorty there was nothing else for me to do
And everything was all good just a week ago
The more i lied, my stories seemed more believable
She loved music and loved songs, repeatable
She say i make her feel the same as justin bieber do
I know the way that im makin you feel is eating you alive
Inside and im sorry if you feel you're not enough

Cause i've been holding onto feelings i got bottled up
A lot of wounds and cuts that have been depriving us
And living to our full expectations and thats a lot of blood (thats a lot of blood)

I know that i've been to blame and damn im sorry for it
And now im feeling all the pressure thats a lot of force
But suicide is a problem that we cannot ignore
Just know forever you live inside my mind and yours
R.I.P

(Chorus, Snax)
She took that blade and put it to her vein
She tried to take away her pain

She closed her eyes and fell straight to sleep, (damn)
That cut's too deep (x2)
