[Intro]
Yeah, Joyner
Woo
Ayo I'm tired of this fucking beat
Ayo, how many of y'all niggas
How many of y'all niggas gotta do this beat?
I'm gonna kill this fucking panda, man
I'm done

[Chorus 1]
I'm tired of this fucking panda song
I don't stand alone
I just wanna wrap my fucking hands across
Stab the head, and break the fucking panda's jaw
Burn em up and turn the fucking candles on
Choke em, beat em, put a couple hammers on em
Dab on a nigga while I'm standing on em
Kick him, punch him, throw him, make him slam the wall
Tie him to a cannon, make him a cannon ball
Into the ocean, make him suffer too
Nigga this is fucking animal abuse
Animal cruelty on the fucking news
I'mma kill the panda till he bloody too

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
I'll make him black and blue, fuck the black and white
I don't fuck with niggas like a pack of dykes
Eat the panda bitch, I got an appetite
I'm out this world, I swear that I'm a satellite
How many rappers gotta try to pay me?
Tired of hearing niggas on the same beat
Time to kill the panda in my old pajamas, flying to Atlanta in the same week
What's a panda to a fucking polar bear?
A gorilla to a monkey, tiger to a puppy, lion to a kitten, wolf to a pigeon, shark to a fish and snake to an infant
Alligator in the water wet
Joyner Lucas to a dinosaur and pet
They ain't know that I'm Tyrannosaurus Rex
Cut the panda up and rip apart his neck
I ain't doing interviews and autographs
I don't like the way you talking all of that
I should fuck your bitch and never call her back
I'd go down in history as an artifact
But...

[Chorus 2]
I'm tired of this fucking panda song
I just wanna wrap my fucking hands across
Stab the head, and break the fucking panda's jaw
Burn em up and turn the fucking candles on
Choke em, beat em, put a couple hammers on em
Dab on a nigga while I'm standing on em
Kick him, hit him, make him slam the wall
Tie him to a cannon, make a cannon ball
Into the ocean, make him suffer too
Nigga this is fucking animal abuse
Animal cruelty on the fucking news
I'mma kill the panda till he bloody too

[Verse 2]
That's a bloody mess, that's a bloody death
Tell them niggas hating on me, "suck a dick"
I ain't satisfied until I get to smash J-Lo and give her ass a couple kids
I’ve been on Animal Planet, I got my hands on the phantom
I kill it again, and nobody gotta hand me a Grammy
God damnit I barely don’t even want to hear what they planning
I sit in a Pana' again and then I blam with the hammer
The man with a plan, you looking at the man in the mirror
The man with a killer that drill a nigga straight in the building
I hang with realest, I really wanna handle my business
I get it, I get it. I gotta get it. Damn it, I did it
I’m out of this commodity
‘Bout'a be outta there, hotter than riding inside of a driver seat at Leh and Ladakh
How did we get out of them out of a prodigy, nigga
All I ever wanted was to hit the lottery, nigga
All eyes on me and they gotta be, nigga
Swear to God, 2Pac could be proud of me nigga
All I know is the fire burning inside of me, nigga
All I ever could be is real as I gotta be, nigga
But why you all wanna act hard?
Where I'm from we get it popping in the backyard
Now everybody wanna run up on the back door
Half pussy half bitch, you a cat-dog
Let me see you do the cat daddy on a black Caddy
Shorty got a fat fattie and flat belly
All she do is lap giving if she act petty
I'll kill a panda, throw that nigga off a balcony for running his mouth to me
And y'all done got me mad
I'mma put the panda in a body bag
What you doing 'round here? Why you standing 'round?
Why you niggas tryna lollygag?
You ain't got a life and you proud of that?
All you wanna know is where the molly at
All you hoes think about is Prada bags
I done killed the panda, where Desiigner at? (Nigga)
But this is not a diss, don't call it that
I'm just giving all you pandas hepatitis, cancer, HIV and a heart attack
All you broke bitches need to call a cab
Cause I ain't (laughs)
Yo, stop rapping over this Goddamn beat cause I ain't too fond of that
Look

[Chorus 3]
I'm tired of this fucking panda song
I don't stand alone
I just wanna wrap my fucking hands across
Stab the head, and break the fucking panda's jaw
Burn em up and turn the fucking candles on
Choke em, beat em, put a couple hammers on em
Dab on a nigga while I'm standing on em like
Like, like this (brrraaaa)
