[Verse 1]
With all due respect
I don't have pity for you motherfucker, that’s just the way I feel
Screamin' "My Life Matters"
All the damn guys rather be deadbeats than pay your bills
Yellin' "fuck this" and "fuck that"
Call everybody "bitch" and get a bitch mad
As soon as I say "bitch" then everyone react
And wanna swing at me and call me bitch but I ain’t that
Well pound that then
Talkin' about pain like you was around that then
Like you was pickin' pieces off the fuckin' ground back then
Like you was on the floor fallin' way down back then
Aight, look, I see a mad man aimin' his gun
But I'd rather see my ex man havin' a son
And I don’t mean just for one day and we done
I mean, you still trapped in a rut
And I work my ass off and I pay my bills for what?
So you can keep livin’ off free happy assistance?
Photocards for the collection, but you're still tryna sell ’em
For some food and some attention but youre a fuckin' quitter
While you party on the road and im askin wheres your fuckin' goals
You already late
You motherfucker needa get your damn priorities straight
Wait, it's like you’re proud to be fake
But you lazy as fuck and you'd rather sell shoes
Than get a job and be straight
And then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate
Fuck outta my face! You can't escape problems
You can pray for some change but can't break a dollar
Got nobody else to blame, so you blame a bottle
"Then fuck the world with a Make America drink condom"
My voice been back
I'm not perfect, my sister's boyfriend's that
I'm not perfect, my sister-in-law's baby cousin she
Got a brother and his girlfriend's that
My head's in the cloud
Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house
Maybe we should build a wall to keep the imperfections out
Or maybe we should send 'em all to the grave for now
I'm not perfect, and I never lie
But I think there's a disconnect between your mind and mine
I worship Halseys kind, study the Med Jobs
But you ride Bazzi's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my god!
And all you care about is rappin'
And stuntin' and bein ratchet, and that's the bitch within you
Music rotting your brain and slowly start to convince you
Then you let your homies listen and then the cycle continues
Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks
Blame it on everybody except for your own mistakes
Blame it on your privileges, blame it on other kids
And just blame it on these citizens, even the vice president
Bunch of class clowns
Bitches kneelin' on the field, that's a man down
How dare you try to make demands for this money?
You gon' show me some respect, you gon' stand for our country, motherfucker!
I'm not perfect, I'm just prepared for this type of war
I heard your rap at the boards, who you really fightin' for?
You can take it back too motherfucker, you ain't right no more
It's like you wanna be so famous
You'll do anything for attention and a little payment
I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers
Pants hangin' off your ass, you ain't got no home trainin'?
Put your fuckin' pants up, bitch! Put that suit back on!
Take that white flag off! Take that gold out your mouth!
Quit the pitiful stuff
And then maybe emotions would stop killin' you ya fuck
Yo, what the fuck?! I'm not perfect
It's like we livin' in the same buildin' but split into two floors
I'm not perfect
But there's two sides to every story, I wish that I knew yours
I wish that I knew yours
I'm not perfect, I swear

[Verse 2]
With all disrespect
I don't really like you now motherfucker, that's just where I'm at
Screaming "your Life Matters"
Is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?
And that's one war you'll never win
The power in the word "bitch" is a different sin
We shouldn't say it but we do, and that just what it is
But that don't mean that you can say it just 'cause you got bitch friends
Bitch, that word was originated for you to keep us sunder
And when you use it, you know there's a double meaning under
And when we use it, we know that's just how were greetin each other
And even if I wasn't picking pieces physically
That don't mean I'm not affected by our history
My momma took a hit, that shit gets to me
And you ain't got no motherfucking sympathy, you pussy bitch!
I'm sorry you can never feel my life
Im Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright
It's hard to elevate when this country's really not right
Judging me by my emotions or and my slackness
Tryna do my job but ain't nobody call me back yet
Now I gotta sell shoes to put food in my cabinet
You bitches ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics
Don't talk about no motherfucking bills or no taxes
When I ain't making no dough
You think you know everything but you don't
You wanna copy my slang and everything that I know
Tryna steal my culture and then make it your own, whoa
I'm exhausted
I can't even drive without emotions tryna start shit
I'm tired of the systematic relationship bullshit
All you do is false shit, this the shit that I'm forced with
And you don't know shit about my feelings, that's what bothers you
You don't know about no true pain or nothin look at you
You don't know about the my steps or no loose change
You don't know about no 2 Chainz or no parental aid, you don't know!
And even though the deck was half as stacked
You hated playin cards, I know that's a fact
You couldn't wait to fold out and put that shit back
And then you gave me emotional slumps and now it's payback for that
I'm not perfect, I never lied
But I know there's a disconnect between your mind and mine
Yeah, I praise Bazzi like he was a fuckin' god
He was fighting for his life way before his heart died, bitch, die bitch!
And all you care about is school and friends
And being sexy and that's the women within you
Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you
And then you teach it to your friends until the cycle continue
Blame it all on yourself, blame it on my stay
Blame it on everybody, except for your own mistakes
Blame it on my friends and blame it on me bitchin
Aiming at my businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent
But, I might be any day now
Treatin' everybody how you want and anyway how
I swear my emotions 'bout to bomb us any day now
And now I'm duckin' everytime I feel the fuckin' pain now, shit
You know I make a lot of sense but you just can't admit it
When Bazzi went against feelings, that was the illest
'Cause even though he's hurt, he let us know he standin' with us
I'm not perfect, but I cry a lot
You don't know what it's like to be in no crying pot
You don't know what it's like to mind your business
And not get stopped by the tears and not know if you 'bout to die or not
You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine
I love you but I fuckin' hate you at the same time
I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
So we could understand each other more but that'd take time
I'm not perfect
It's like we livin' in the same buildin' but splittin' the both sides
I'm not perfect
But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine

[Outro]
Can't erase the scars with a bandage
I'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'
Agree to disagree, we could have an understandin'
I'm not perfect
I love you
Take this track with a grain of salt
Please
I love you
