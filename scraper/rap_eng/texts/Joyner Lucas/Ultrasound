Yo wassup, this is Joyner
I'm unable to take your call right now
Leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace

[Brief Message]
You know, you really piss me off sometimes
I spent all night waiting for you to come home
And I've woken up without you
I don't know where you are or why you're not answering your phone
But I'm starting to get worried
I really hope you're not pissing away the last of our money
At the stupid casino again
Because you know my next check won't be here 'til the third
And we literally have nothing right now
If you did go to the casino and you have more money then, I guess
