[Verse 1]
I used to be all you loved
I used to be all you needed
And I used to be all you dreamed of
And I don't know what to do
Baby I'm falling down
And maybe I'm overthinking
Maybe I'm drunker now
Bitch I ain't fucking with you

[Hook]
Don't tell me you love me
Girl I don't believe you now
Cause I don't understand the feeling
(Don't understand it I don't want to be with you no no no)
Don't tell me you love me
Girl I don't believe you now
Cause I don't understand the feeling
(Don't understand it, I don't understand it now, don't tell me you love me)

[Verse 2]
Give me a moment
And let me tell you how I feel on some grown shit
And I've been drinking Hennessy and seeing clear now
I'm finna tell you how a nigga fucking feel now
Bitch you brought me down when I was doing good
All you bring is drama you a drama queen
Don't tell me that you love me cause it sounds good
I don't need you're fucking money, wait (hold on gimme that back)

Girl I was just playing can you call me back
Can you call me back (x4)

I was just playing can you call me back, can you call me back

[Hook]
