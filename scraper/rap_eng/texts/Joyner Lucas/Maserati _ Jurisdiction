Man, I wish I had a Maserati (Maserati)
I'd be taking pictures for the paparazzi (paparazzi)
Feels so good, she wanna pop a molly (woo)

Go check my history, can't nobody stop me (nobody stop me)
I should take a picture with Mahatma Gandhi (yeah)
Was creating the music when the cops behind me (cops behind me)
And now I'ma bring them strippers to the private party (private party)
Black laces, I don't rock Versace (never)
I be speeding with the engines on the Kawasaki (vroom)
Couple shots to the kamikaze (tank)
We can get to cookin' like some hot hibachi (hot hibachi)
My Spanish bitch, she give me sloppy-toppy (bang)
You should use your manners when you talkin' 'bout me (use 'em)
I've been ridin' solo, I ain't got no posse (uh-uh)
I just saw the people that forgot about me

[Segue]
Don't you wish you were? (yeah, yeah)
Don't you, don't you wish you were? (yeah) (yeah)
Don't you, don't you wish you were a little bit hard? (yeah)

[Part II: Jurisdiction]

[Intro]
Joyner, Joyner, Joyner
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Uh, put the cause on the totem, put the balls on the boat
And hit 'em all with the motive (with the motive)
Joyner's all in the focus
And the blogs want to post a niggas songs and you notice (and you notice)
I'm a star, undervoted
I'm a dog, I'm a Doberman pinscher, you a pony
You a unicorn, Louis Vuitton, sneakers on woadie
Trying to be up on me and my niggas like you know me
You don't me
You just know what the people wanna tell ya (yeah)
Talkin' on the low, but the speakers gonna kill ya
Sleepin' on my back with the TV on the ceilin'
Got Jeezy on, chillin' with the kiwi hard sippin'
E'erybody wanna live like Tony Montana (Tony Montana)
Sniffin' out the coke with the homie, don-da-da
Drug dealin', bang bang, with the phony bandanna
'Til the homies run right up in your cozy ma√±ana
That's real (that's real)
Fuck a talk (fuck a talk)
Funny how a funny nigga come across (come across)
Funny how the money make a sucker talk
When it feel good like a nigga took the rubber off (that's filthy)
I see both sides like tug-a-war (tug-a-war)
Joyner's on fire, close the oven door (woo)
Beat the pussy up like a drummer boy
Thought you ran the city, what the fuck you niggas runnin' for?
Fuck the law
Tell the politician I'm a terrorist (terrorist)
And tell the government that I'm a colored kid
Tryna make a penny off of half a G
And that'll be the day you catch me workin' at a god damn Applebee's
Nigga, don't be dappin' me (dappin' me)
'Cause we ain't got shit to talk about unless you talkin' 'bout a salary (salary)
And rappers wanna talk about battle me
But they can suck my dick with a mouth full of cavities
Oh, you in trouble (trouble)
And I love it how they hate you (how they hate you)
But they actin' like they love you
Then they kiss you, then they hug you (then they kiss you)
Make a screwed face at you (uh-huh)
Middle finger saying "Fuck you, nigga"
That's just motivation (motivation)
I ain't hatin' like a sucker (uh-huh)
But I treat you like a slugger
Uppercut you 'til you crumble (uh-huh)
Have you singin' like Usher (like Usher)
You a dish to my supper
Motherfuck a nigga, uh

[Verse 2]
Never ever have I ever
Ever seen another motherfucker fuck her
Fuck her better, better than him
If I ever did
Then I was never ever on this planet
But I plan to dead him and forget him
If I ever seen another
'Nother different mother fucker
On a level of a level one
Level headed rapper
That be rappin' circles
'Round the circles that you rappers burnin'
Burnin' rappers like I'm burnin'
Burnin' bridges with the niggas
That be burnin' bitches
On a murder mission
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction (jurisdiction)
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction

[Verse 3]
I'm on a murder mission
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
The judge told me I don't listen
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Run and tell the competition
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
I said, I'm on a murder mission
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
I'm on a murder mission
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
The cops told me I don't listen
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Run and tell the competition
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction

[Outro]
Jurisdiction
Regarded as mercilessly destructive and unstoppable
Something that demands blind devotion
Or sacrifice
What are you willing to sacrifice?
To censor the word is ground
When you can, it's comparable
To mean something more than
Jurisdiction
