Don't wanna live to see another day
I never know what to say
All I do is get asked questions about my depression
Most get the impression that I'm weak
Everyday I feel like I've reached my peak, so to speak
I never bitched about it, I never wanted attention
I never acted like I was in another dimension
I always knew the repercussions of my extentions
My Ma would always say, "How could you be so selfish?"
Is it not selfish to make me stay here by myself?
Is it not selfish to make me stay here in this living hell?
I need extra love, and that ain't even enough
Someone please fill this empty void inside of me, please!
Someone provide for me, or even guide me to steps of being happy, because right now 24/7 I'm feeling crappy
I've tried everything, nothing works, when I don't show up they assume I'm idle. I wish I was just idle, but instead I'm thinking about putting a bullet in the side of my head
Sometimes I lay here and cry for in bed wishing all these shitty emotions could just be shed like skin
Maybe soon I'll build up enough courage to commit this sin
Maybe soon I'll snap out of it, if I don't I guess I'll just put a gap
In the side of my shit
Insert the bullet right through my brain, I really hope I gain everything I've been dreaming about
I just wanna get out of this rut, seems impossible
Hasn't seemed plausible since the day I was five
What is death? I wonder what it's like. I wonder if everyone ponders that from the day they're a tyke
I finally feel it, I finally feel the courage coursing through my veins to just pick up that gun and blow my brains
I can finally get rid of this pain, I go and grab the gun, pick it up off the ground, put it to my head, then look all around
Make sure nobody sees me, don't want nobody to tease me
Fuck man, this is it. All my pain will finally be relieved
Maybe time will turn back to the day I was conceived
*gunshot*
