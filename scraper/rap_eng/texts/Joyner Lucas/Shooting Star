[Verse 1]
I get love down in Cali' like the homie Dre
But these hoes think I'm Snoop they won't go away
They should play this down in Compton with a cherry drop top
Then everybody get to blasting till they blow the bass
I ain't gotta say much bitches know the face
Joyner Lucas got it tatted on the shoulder blade
? claimy oyou just ?
I just wanna put it in her mouth and make her poker face
Tell me did you take it for the night
I know what you thinking I'm your saviour for the night
I've been paper chasing till my bank be looking right
I just need some motivation what you dragging for the night
And don't be talking bout them other heads
Ask about me I've been macking like a fucking crack
Bitches love me in the country like I'm a lieutenant
I'm just honest with you don't mistake me for a fucking sac
Nah

[Chorus]
Homie I'm just what you made me I'm a shooting star
Got a house on the headland and a million cars
We done came from the projects you know who we are
I'm fine and on top of that livin' in the sky
X2

[Verse 2]
Black shorts and a tank top ? charm from the chain spot
Couple dollas in my pocket I don't need much
I don't care for bragging you can have it I don't need much
I remember i was just a nada
Shaggy with da holla back when bitches used to call me Mr. Labalaba
Now Mr. Popacala Mr. Drop a dolla
Now Mr. Master P Mr. ?
I got bitches I ain't bored of yet all em ? they gon hit me with the ?check
I ain't even got ? it's the ? bay
Then she wanna fuck even tho she never saw me yet
But I told her don't be talking bout them other heads
Ask about me I've been macking like a fucking crack
Bitches love me in the country like I'm a lieutenant
I'm just honest with you don't mistake me for a fucking sac
Hoe
For a fucking sac

[Chorus]
Homie I'm just what you made me I'm a shooting star
Got a house on the headland and a million cars
We done came from the projects you know who we are
I'm fine and on top of that livin' in the sky
