We deserve this life, we deserve this life
We deserve this life, we deserve this life
We deserve this life, we deserve this life
We deserve this life, we deserve this life

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Reminiscing back when a nigga used to get laughed at
And now we laugh at you
Remember when you used to talk about me?
Well look where that got you, huh
No worse feeling than someone that doubt you, huh
'Cus the people don't really give a fuck about you, huh
Then you start popping and everybody call you
Even yo ex-bitch wanna be up all around you, huh
Look, fall back (fall back)
'Cus they don't know about that life
I'm drinking all the Henny, get mad right
And forget what a nigga did last night
I'm turned up and I got mad liquor
I been a half-nigga since I been half-white
And now I'm half man, half amazing
Trying to stay true in this plastic nation
We American, ain't we?
They're ready to blame me
Trying to get rich so to hell if it ain't me
You know they just - they're ready to flame me
'Cus I ball like Garnett but I better than KG
Two white hoes want a play day on it
Ten Puerto Ricans and some Reggae Tony
Ass so fat you could vacay on it
I don't even need class 'cus my A game on and I'm ready to die
Okay I'm ready to die
Die for my beliefs
Die for how to beef
Die inside the streets
Die and not believe
Die they watching me
To die I gotta leave
Die for my life
Die for my rights
Die for my lord
Die for my war
Die for my story
Die for my glory
This is top 40, bitch I'm not sorry
No, I'm not for the ride
To my dead niggas, I said
You could meet me at the top of the sky
I can feel it on my soul, I know God is alive
And the devil's a lie, shit
Okay the devil's alive
Been ahead of my time since I was 9, shit
I was nicer to niggas in '96

[Verse 2: Kyle Bent]
It's been a long time coming, now we up to something for real
It's been a long time coming, trying to turn some hundreds to mills
And trust me this ain't happen over night
Had to feel them struggles 'fore we seen the highs
Knew if I got the chance I'd turn this to a heist
Had to steal the moment, couldn't pay the price
And I wasn't thinking twice - listen
I been working for a better life
Remember waking in the dead of night
That was my next plan, next plan
Can't stand the fact that we ain't living right
Head filled with problems like we live with lice
Times were dirty like their issues mixed with Sprite
But I always knew my future still was bright
(Always knew my future still was bright)
We some chandeliers been in shambles, but I persevere
Life's a gamble, take a chance and roll a pair
Of some dice, break the ice like polar bears
We gon' own the year, we gon' break the surface
We gon' switch the plans, we gon' make 'em nervous
It's a new religion, we gon' change the sermon
We gon' wake them up, we gon' raise the curtain
Show them what's been lurking I been learning
That being myself is therapeutic
Crazy how much people out here really lose it
Trying to be somebody that they isn't used to
Understand you can't be replicated and the story you living is Hella crucial
Ain't nobody in this world could ever do you
Ain't nobody in this world that's better suited, baby

[Hook: Kyle Bent]
We deserve this life, we deserve this life
We deserve this life, we deserve this life
We deserve this life, we deserve this life
We deserve this life, we deserve this life
