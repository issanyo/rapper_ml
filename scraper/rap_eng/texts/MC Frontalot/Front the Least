[Hook: Katrina  Dideriksen]
A reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain
And there’s a reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain
And there’s a reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain
And there’s a reason
Frontalot

[Verse 1: MC Frontalot]
I’m renowned for my genuine and forthright stance
Now, I never nod knowingly nor wink in a glance
Got to think in advance, plot ahead, and prepare
‘cause the name of the MC, once it’s declared
Is a strong signifier of a fast one pulled
Was a fat tank of fronting turned a teaspoonful?
Are you supposed to suppose I’ve inverted my act?
Is it yet another feint to disorient and distract?
Here’s a pact. Let’s enter it. I’ll be good
For the length of the song that’s already afoot
And I’ll put a little English on it, but believe
That the last thing Frontalot will do is deceive
So, please, this is actual and not made up
But if Frontalot says it, skepticism erupts
I’m not driven to hush. You can heed the reply:
Always tell it like it is, and there is a reason why

[Hook: Katrina Dideriksen]
A reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain
And there’s a reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain
And there’s a reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain
And there’s a reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain

[Verse 2: MC Frontalot]
Since that’s settled, let’s get to the facts
Every even-keeled stoic always overreacts
All solutions are hacks. Every opposite is an equal
(and if it attracts, look out or you’ll make a sequel)
Freedom’s a right but having any means you’re privileged
And our religion of consumerism might have hit a glitch
Clowns are unhappy. Jugglers drop stuff
I display cowardice whenever you talk tough
My least favorite thing is a hypocrite, but I’ll be one
And the worst thing about my mistakes is they’re all reruns
And I’ll discuss me by name. This occurs
Frontalot gets more recognition than he deserves
I take sincerity backroads but I keep it in the lane
And I promised you a reason so I’d better explain
Why the rest of the catalog appears to careen
If I don’t mean it and you know it then you know just what I mean

[Hook: Katrina Dideriksen]
And there’s a reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain
And there’s a reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain
And there’s a reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain
And there’s a reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain

A reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain
And there’s a reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain
And there’s a reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain
And there’s a reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain
