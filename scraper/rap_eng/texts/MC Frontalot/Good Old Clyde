[Verse 1]
MC Frontalot stole a beat today (Help! Thief!)
And you can take another look or you can look the other way
But to ignore this crime (is a crime in itself!)
I'm unarmed but a shelf of JB LP's is a wealth
To any rapper worth a salt-lick
Me what you get once you dry out the baltic
(Who's there? What's that?) what, you didn't you hear
'bout the beat that you already got all up in your ear?
(All up in your ear)

[Hook]
(Who's there?) My man Clyde Stubblefield
(What's that?) The sound of the funky drummer
(Who's there?) My man Clyde Stubblefield
(What's that?) The sound of the funky drummer

(Oh, golly!)

[Verse 2]
The MC Frontalot'll take a well known beat and loop it;
I'll front like I wrote it, as if you were stupid
Don't look at me crooked, I be hard to blame
When I claim that I ain't ever even heard the same
The same what? The same beat? The same drama!
(I recall) Chuckie D getting irritated at Madonna
While we're already in trouble we'll
Wring another single out of old Clyde Stubblefield

[Hook]

(There you are, you naughty thing!)

[Verse 3]
Radio suckers never seem to play me
I think because I used to be a man other than me
(How could that be?) When the lyrics are furious
Well, you hurry just to find a beat. I meet curious
MC's: Yo, where'd you get the drum from?
I pummel'em on the advice of LL's mum
(Let me ride) Throw the beat in the trunk, I let the rubber peel
Stretch tracks on the grave of Clyde Stubblefield

[Hook]

(There you are, you naughty thing!)
