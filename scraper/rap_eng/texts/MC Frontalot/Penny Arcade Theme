[Intro:]
And now, let's begin to type some words
Yo, when I hit it...

[Hook]

I hit L shift-O to the quote and then dollar
If you know the dir of the nerdcore rhyme, you holler


[Verse 1:]
Nerd-ho! Warm the mic up
Yo, we ‘bout to strike up
This band of nebbishes
Who cultivate nebulous fetishes:
The FPS, RPG or MMPOG
Any obsession to blather over by blog
Or BBS. Step and possess. Hone thy geekishness
Your frame rate and frags to date both impress
And yes, your affinity for a certain site of some amusement
(a classically adorned parlor of fun where you let loose pent-
Up cent pieces to partake of flicker-dramas)
Gets you branded a sniper bitch or rocket mama-
Humper. (Oh no!) They said you’re cheatin'
But with coins in hand you got more game than Wil Wheaton


[Verse 2:]
When’s this MC ‘bout to get funny? I’m losing patience
Want to know how the pants contain one Wang & two Next stations
And a Tandy hole, where he plays whack-a-mole with the toilet paper
Frontalot can rock the PA song at the lowest common denominator
Not as a hater of culture or lacker in class
But an expert at math
Accounting how the Penny Arcade 0\/\/nZz j00r aZz

[Hook]

(that is the way we play...)
