[Verse 1: Adam WarRock]
Picture me rolling on a set of twenty-fours
Picture me laughing like I got no remorse
See me composing the perfect song (yeah)
The perfect chorus; pictures of me hung over the front door
Cause my fingers they streak and they dance
Shake and advance the feelings inside of every word (yes)
Every utterance; never shook for a bit
Never stuttered kid (no)
I steered into the stormy weather after the rudder split
My head was filled with ideas
Man I'm gonna be big some day
Any day now, any minute now, any second
Any millisecond
Any quantum of time; just waiting for God
Or the universe come to step in
Maybe music can save me
Maybe nothing can
Maybe nobody as great as me; the suffering
Maybe it leads to a place we can be brothers and
Maybe that's why all the kids are screaming "Wolfgang"

[Chorus: Louis Logic]
And this thing it tears you apart
And this thing it tears into your heart
When they don't care when they don't care
When the music stops and you're left
All alone in the dark

[Verse 2: M.C. Frontalot]
Picture me settling for old age; a gold cage
Polite applause from aristocratic no-names
More likely flame out; age of twenty-seven
Creditors in mourning, crying women with the legend
Of the Wolfgang Amadeus
Never could escape the little
But I'll step out of my cradle
Leaking symphonies like spittle
I be tearin' up the circuit showin' off the fancy finger-work
Never seen his likeness yet, another king observed
And I'm a gird myself for accolades
Flirt with all the duchesses wonder why they misbehave
Wander through the colonnade sign a couple autographs
Laugh a composition out; this is like an epitaph
To all the music ever writ before I hit the harpsichord
Before I ever gave the people what their hearts adored
Salieri scribbling un-echoing diminished fifths
Take my requiem and notice how it's effortless

[Chorus: Louis Logic]
And this thing it tears you apart
And this thing it tears into your heart
When they don't care when they don't care
When the music stops and you're left
All alone in the dark

[Verse 3: Adam WarRock]
Picture me rocking on a chair on my porch
Picture me broken after my third divorce
Pictures torn and left stranded and strewn across the floor
Picture me when I'm not a picture anymore
The portrait of an artist as a young man, no mam
I never wrote Ulysses, I never wanted to
I couldn't sit still long enough
And so I chose to make the stuff I thought you
Might wanna hear
With this pen in my hand I've been damned
Since the first breath that I took
The first song that I sung, to no one
And the last song that I sing
Will be to the same number of people
Who ever even cared that I wrote some
Back in the day I used to be big (yeah)
Used to be someone, used to be something more
Than the shell that you see
They used to speak my name with the same
Reverence they use for his (yes)
And so they called me "Salieri"

[Chorus]
And this thing it tears you apart
And this thing it tears into your heart
When they don't care when they don't care
When the music stops and you're left
All alone in the dark
