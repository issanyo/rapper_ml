[MC Frontalot]
Listen up! I’m an American
And I know just what to be scared of
When I hear the word “foreign” I go
Immediately down to the GroceryCo
For my anti-terrorism do-it-yourself
Home kit that they got there up on the shelf
With my stubbornly health, I can’t get exploded;
Haven’t got wealth enough to devote it
In such large measure to picking up bits
So I’d better be prepared on the terrorist tip!
And I do that there in the simplest way:
By carefully considering Canad-i-a
And deeming its shiftiness quotient high
(got a notion why and it’s ocean sized)
And I’m mostly fine with you people, but watch it
Canadia strikes me as unpatriotic

[Chorus / MC Frontalot]
Let me get this straight:
Provinces, not states?
Who’s your president? (nawww)
See, that’s what I meant!
Post the border guard!
Prepare to bombard!
Countrymen, I say to ya:
Beware Canadia!

[Jesse Dangerously]
How’d we ever get so misconstrued?
I thought I heard ‘em all, but this one’s rude
Listen, dude, don’t ask for favours
Then speak ill of your next door neighbour
From West Coast ravers to Northeast seal hunt, I’m shocked
How am I supposed to feel, Frontalot?
Jeez, keep your guns and Glocks under locks and keys, please!
I’m stopped and freezed, cops are easily bought for cheap
I know not to sleep when I walk the streets of
New York or Los Angeles, crime riddled cities:
A fine kettle of fish where you’ll find little pity
Every piddly bit of validity in me
Exhibits lividity: you’re an idiot indeed!
Consider me out; your beef doesn’t concern me
I’m cutting dead weight like a weekend at Bernie’s

[Chorus]

[Wordburglar]
Yo, Jesse, I think that dude Front’s onto us
Time to let those neutron bombs erupt
Then release Snake Men in the AM
To make people watch reruns of Amen
“Say again?” No
Halifax-Jupiter-Mexico:
We gotcha cornered like the edge of a room
We got alien heads in a tomb
“Huh?” Catch my drift like slipstream;
It’s better on the top like whipped cream
Y’all can have Pamela Lee
R&D already cloned her family tree
We got implants for your medulla lobes
All we want to do is rule the globe
But for now, we’ll let you make believe
That we don’t put microchips in maple leaves

[MC Frontalot]
You put in the effort to pick up our language
Though I do notice occasional manglage
Of pronunciation. The letters O U
Come out your mouth oooo. Don’t know why but they do
Plus somebody told me y’all are rich
Got foliage, rock oil in pitch
But if you don’t have our freedom, you hate it
Gonna put you on the list to get liberated
C’mon!

[Chorus x2]

[Wordburgler]
Yo Front man, come visit!
We'll go to Tim Hortons, and uh
Check out some beavers
We got... balloons
And blue money
Snow pants
And soup
