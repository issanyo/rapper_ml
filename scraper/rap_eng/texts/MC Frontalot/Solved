[Verse 1]
You keep on rubbing on my head
Like you’re trying to get a genie out
I suggest instead: present your problem freely now
Easy how it’s put into words and then dismantled
This is the technique that I prefer. It’s as good as handled
If I’ve heard it. You need a verdict or a parsing
The perfect scrabble word, or an alibi for arson
Or a parson for your wedding, or a person for your team
Or somebody to discover you and realize your dreams
Now it seems like it’s impossible for a solitary rapper
To guarantee the fix without regard to what’s the matter
Yet I stand here certain I can settle all confusion
MC Frontalot’s your one-stop solution

[Hook]
No riddle to test resolve
No middle it’s best dissolved
What gets sorted out last of all
Gets solved. It gets solved

Who’s asking to advance the cause?
Who’s answering the casting calls?
What gets sorted out last of all
Gets solved. It gets solved

[Verse 2]
You say, “Front, yo, that’s your answer for everything:
Just tell you the problem, my cares will go languishing.”
Anguish in, anguish out, I always caution
If you’d lean on me more, you’d be in contortion half as often
If you’d just open up, you wouldn’t have to hunker down
Trying to sort it for yourself. Your buddy Front is around!
Come on, what is it now? Finances? Romance souring?
Puzzled how it is that my advice is so damn towering?
This I recommend: don’t call a gift horse dentist
Just take my two cents; they could be more expensive
If ignored. You must entrust me with your need to know the way
I can fix the future for you here today

[Hook]
No riddle to test resolve

What gets sorted out last of all

[Verse 3]
Everybody wonders when the world will end
Hoping that I’ll say it isn’t going to. Make pretend
That this timed sprint could easily last forever
Peruse fine print. Don’t skim breezily past addenda
Rendering all promises subject to change
There’s only so much of the universe that I can re-arrange
Can’t seem to get estranged from the laws of physics
Don’t know the lotto, or the number in your brain
(What is it?)
And also, if your trouble is me?
I’ve been pondering solutions since 1973
None were satisfactory. So let’s focus
On everything else; your problems — I got this
