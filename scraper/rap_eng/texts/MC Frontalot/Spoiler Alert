[Verse 1: Frontalot]

You're annoyed when I talk during the film
It's just another classic that you haven't seen (still!)
Just another ill-in-the-head in the plot;
"Norman Bates, is that all you got?
Might have guessed from the name of the thing." Don't complain
That you never heard the ending of The Crying Game
Well, it's a penis, and at this point a shaggy dog
(which is: nothing to see here; move along)
The Apes rule the Earth. Vader's poppa to Luke
Brad Pitt and Ed Norton are obviously two
People, but they've got to share one character
Bruce ain't alive, kid, no matter how he stares at you
Snape kills Dumbledore but with a noble motive
Everybody's guilty on the Oriental locomotive
Veidt's villainy ends world squabbling
And Deckard is a replicant (probably)

Say I ruin everything for you — well, it's mutual. Well, it's mutual

[Verse 2: Frontalot]
Don't wager on survival for Bambi's mom
Artax, Old Yeller, Mufasa, King Kong
All spawn of Medea should fear for your throat
All on the Titanic should fear for your boat
Yo, Frontalot gave it away before it happened
If you're in Moby Dick then I hope you're not the captain;
If you are, then I urge: rethink revenge
Cause you're headed for the bottom and you're bringing your friends
Fall into Wonderland then you're definitely dreaming
Sleeping by the stream, and all is only seeming
If you're in the Bible, it ends in Armageddon
If you're in the Y2K, it's less upsetting
If you're living in the 80s, spoiler: gay Wham!
Space ships can blow up. Trickle-down economics is a scam
But you'll figure that out
I don't want to wreck the ending for you, make you pout

[Hook]

Say I ruin everything for you — well, it's mutual
In the future, do not do what you do

[Verse 3: Frontalot]
If you're in the French Revolution, I warn it won't last
If you're in the Kennedy clan, beware a muzzle flash
Airplanes, also, quite often destroyed them
And if you're a Lennon, there's a Chapman. Avoid him
Boy when I'm spoiling the ending you frown
No empire lasts forever, go to town
But if you're old Rome, look out for that Nero
In case you're a countdown, look out for zero
Any time you're a ticking bomb, explode
(and nobody make it out except Horatio)
Cause every peanut brittle's got a snake inside
And Jacks-in-the-box, meant to startle, pop high
If you didn't know already, I'll apologize
Peek-a-boo's a game; it's a trick of the eyes
Not a bending of reality itself
Spoiler for infants: adults use stealth
