[Chorus: Ken Flagg]
As in lunch
As in speech
As in beer
As in liberty
As in liberty

[Verse 1: MC Frontalot]
On the internet, it's like everybody's always got their hackles up
"So many holes in your argument you need a spackle truck!
So many goals you've failed to meet with your rhetoric!"
Hush up your feuding for a second, Front'll settle it
You ought to bet a bottom dollar if you got one: freedom's hard fought
Folks prefer at least the amount that they caught
Hold of already
Ask 'em, they definitely don't want to relinquish any
Ask 'em for a penny, gratis, get turned down
Ask 'em for a free lunch, get called ass clown
But ask for an opinion, proposition turnt 'round:
Certainly you'll have mine (I would even ask how
You'd hope to avoid it, free as I feel to divulge one)
Some truths self-evident, but not among them: your notion
You're posting computer code's supposed to be free
They'll dispute it, go "What's freedom even mean?"

[Chorus: Ken Flagg]
As in lunch
As in speech
As in beer
As in liberty
As in liberty

[Verse 2: MC Frontalot]
Now I'm not trying to get all Lawrence Lessig on you
But I'm more or less beyond the fear
Now the response is clear:
Use your conscience here, as well as your self-interest
Keep your potential seditions well witnessed
Or just complaints you like to make about the state
At the moment you're great. You post 'em up for debate
Post 'em up for agreement among a secret cabal of your peers
Be certain while the freedom train is rolling, all of you steer
Give wide berth to closed-source security
Anything you can't audit and reproduce thoroughly
Squirrelly EULA that governs your posts, don't it?
Free code's ironically only way you can own it
And keep it displayed until it echoes in the public domain
Pull down capitalism till it's rubble and chain
Since a way to get pwned is all it became
If you're having a freedom, I'll have double the same

[Chorus: Ken Flagg]
As in lunch
As in speech
As in beer
As in liberty
As in liberty

As in lunch
As in speech
As in beer
As in liberty
As in liberty

[Outro: Ken Flagg & MC Frontalot]
Liberty
Beer
Liberty
Beer, lunch
Liberty
Liberty
Liberty
Liberty
