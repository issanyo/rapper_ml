[Verse 1: Mike Doughty]
The light of these amazing days
Shines from your face like a radiation
Erase the train of a dream state
Scratched clean of the complications

The fire falls
From your face
The noise of it all
The razor days
Days and days
The waves I’ve roamed
The skin of brine
The rise and bolts
The surface lime
The champion
The champion
The champion

The blue cats in the night pavilion
I put the stove on medium heat
The rudiment gaffes and fiascos
Jumping in the jump seat

The nightmare
The red stains
The [?]
The rattle brained
The [?]
The world ends there
The [?]
The waving air
The champion
The champion
The champion


[Verse 2 : MC Frontalot]
At the end of the brawl
You wear a busted lip
But it’s a custom fit
But keep adjusting it
Till it juts your soul from your silhouette
Your portraits in the fall of fame isn’t it
No
Then if it’s all the same
It took one screwdriver to install the blame
And now one plaque
Reads your name under champion of lost causes
Can’t be all pausing insisting in all righteousness
Knocking you over elevates you to the heights of bliss
This is you at your most cogent
Nothing left after explosion


[Outro: Mike Doughty (Laura Lee Bishop)]
(The Champion) The champion
The champion
The champion
The champion
(The champion)
(The champion)
