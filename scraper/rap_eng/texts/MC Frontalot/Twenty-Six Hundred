Wrong end of the joystick stuck up in the hand-hold:
You're in line for a pitfall, kid. You get pwned
In terms of your two-player mastery. Weak!
This is once per scan line, not hide and seek
I'm the pride of geeks who are shameless and brazen
In their snobbery over whose console is most ancient
And most Asian. Bootleg or legit?
Emulate it, rear-projection on the side of a blimp
Elevated; point up; point out the pixels
But don't miss your button finger, whippersnapper. This old
Rapper will top your score with his best
(Frontalot already did, the Polaroid will attest.)
