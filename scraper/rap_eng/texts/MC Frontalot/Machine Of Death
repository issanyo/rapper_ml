Put a nickel in it, you’ll receive a consultation
And there’s no need be patient or to check the calibration
‘cause it’s instant and it’s accurate, it’s simple and it’s true:
The prick upon your finger, then it’s printing out the clue
Well, you knew when you came in. It saved time explaining
That this is how you end. Each one displays the same thing:
CAUSE OF EXPIRATION, emblazoned on the card
You’ll ponder in the morning as the day’s about to start
You’ll ponder in the evening as you fail to fall asleep
And keep believing as you’re seething to yourself that this’ll reap
Its benefit to your survival, but it won’t, it never does
Whether you embrace the exit or you fight and rant and cuss

We’re all in this together, yes the life term’s plenary
And this is the machinery
Yet you exit all alone, never knowing how it seemed to be:
That this is the machinery
Keep it out of mind, it’s defined by the c to g
And this is the machinery
Life goes by, you’re admiring the scenery
But this is the machinery, this is the machinery

You can’t escape the outcome, be it ELEPHANT or CELEBRANT
ACCELERANT or DESICCANT. Specifics are irrelevant
And anyway, it much more likely reads CRASH
Of vehicle or mainframe? Don’t know, can’t ask
Market maybe, that could kill an investor. And
Glad it didn’t say SICK, so much is pestilent
“So long,” the rest of them reasons for dying
I’ve narrowed it down by machine, and it’s scrying
It’s prognosticating, it’s taking its measure
And my card might indicate INCLEMENT WEATHER
But I’ll still endeavor to wander outside
Fated, and there located, I’m along for the ride
