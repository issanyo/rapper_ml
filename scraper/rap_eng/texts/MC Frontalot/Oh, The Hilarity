Front's non-comedy stylings are piling up
This must be the 5th one like I'm just some punk-
Ass non-clown not here to amuse you
You're free to hit stop, go get hi & watch blue's clues
I got loose screws in my comed-o-matic at the moment
The fun-fun truck is stuck in the parking lot doing donuts
And though cuts by front oft times cause ha-has unequalled
Ain't nothing funny about 250,000 drowned people

How I wish there were! the rhymes could unfurl apace
Instead I'm eking every syllable out, an ungeeklike doubt in the grace
Of my brainstem. pen to the pad: clumsy
Six weeks since I sat dumbly
Watched the numbers go up like the odometer on a formula one
Doubled in every headline as I fed my un-
Drowned first-world self another breakfast
Imagining to have a life not even wrecked, just
Washed away clean, set out to ocean
Kids who coveted stranded fish caught in the motion
Of an unstable planet and its swiftly tilting seashores
Pardon if the rhyme's a little free-form
And I ain't been reborn lately but I may be someday
Like 250 thousand souls radioing mayday

And imagine them all coming back at once
A legion of newborns with wet eyes placing trust
In mainlands, mountains, and landlocked states
Keenly aware of potential repetitions of fate
This adumbrated by the wobble in the womb
Ever sorrowful at the notion of a typhoon
Ever gleeful as a tree-full of dry leaf falls down
To land undampened, soft and still on the ground
(we're still on the ground)

So look
I like making humor. I poke fun at tumors
All the people that my government tortures, it ain't rumors
It's comedy gold! and I'm old hand around the gallows
All the jokes I crack are callous and callow
And shallow and in poor taste
But I can't seem to summon that up today
Might say all's fair in despair and upheaval
But there ain't nothing funny about 250,000 drowned peop
