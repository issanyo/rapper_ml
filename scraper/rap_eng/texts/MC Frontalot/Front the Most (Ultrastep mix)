MC frontalot is not installed
So don't call 800-FRONT4ALL
Off the ball of wax, to rock the rough tracks
Thumbtacks all up in the mix so relax
I hacks a beat together like a slasher rampage
Mc frontalot is inundated by the rhythm arrays
Some days I brag some days I boast
24/7 I front the most

You wouldn't think that I would front
Most days do nothing but
Sit around dropping the lyrics into the drum cuts
Buts, ands, ors, I hear naysay
Don't play! mc front'll get offended, go away
Hey now, there's no need to be real
Honk honking on the sample like a trained m-seal
We all seek a second steppin from the post
24/7 I front, I front the most

What am I, wrecking every break beat?
That could take eight weeks
Only ever stop frontin to smoke bowls, take leaks
And sleep, I catch cat naps
Sit in front the mic so much that my ass chaps
Gaps in the tape, I was frontin in the other room
Boogalooin' well I wasn't though I wanted to'n
I'm gonna rock the mic day and night
Until I give up the ghost
24/7 I front the most
