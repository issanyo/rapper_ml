Young cub, this is the story of how you must never neglect
(no matter how preoccupied your nascent intellect)
To keep in mind doors! And close them behind you
Any time you leave one ajar, she might find you
I describe: human girl with wealth for hair
Ghosts for eyes, who wanders woods. Bears, beware
Through any doorway no closure obstructs
She wanders out of hunger. If she sees you, eats you up
Bear cub tallow scone with a honeydew butterwhip;
Consommé from your bones and your cartilage;
Fennel-mint sausages ground from your lungs;
Hollandaise all atop your remains by the time that she’s done
It’s why we leave porridge sitting
Case she makes it through an entryway, cold jaws dripping
Her saliva unremitting and her soul corrupt
(She could eat that instead of you, little cub.)

Gold Locks
Gets in through your open door
Stalks across the parlor floor
Creeping on her brunch
Let’s hope
She has had her fill
Won’t be lingering here still
Seeking out her brunch

Amber alert: call the fairy tale ambulance
‘cause this banana-colored-haired girl’s bananas, stabbing bears
Beware of the bear hugs. I'll kill you with my bare hands
When you’re barely sleeping, tear your lungs and leave you barren chest
Don't believe the tales they told you where the humans win?
I'll take your humerus and feed it to my human friends
Eyes luminous, voice is very soothing, yes
I’ll break and enter with entitlement that few possess
I’ll go crying through the forest and the woods
To the farmers in the village with an armful of goods
And by an armful of goods, I mean meat
And I mean your little bear cub arms and your feet
So better promise to your mama: leave the door locked
‘Cause you don't want to be at the base of a farmer’s tall pot
Don't mean to scare you, I really need to warn you:
Watch out for the frock ‘cause Goldilocks is coming for you

Calm, calm, little bear. Settle down deep in your blanketing
Yes, she’s lurking, but best remain sanguine
She’s not angry at you, just hungry
People don’t have feelings like bears, honey
They’re supernatural creatures that eat without cease
And they keep bound books full of us recipes
And this one freezes our hearts on return to the lair
What if she’s gotten in and she’s still there?
Don’t clutch the blanket, she visits when we’re absent
That and your absentmindedness acts as an attractant
One moment’s diligence is all it takes to defend
Your mother and me and yourself from an unwelcome end
All of her human friends, they could bring mimosa
Goldie gets her knives in you, might invite them all over
To the spot that she found for brunch
It could happen if you leave the door open just once
