Nerdlife? You live in it
No types prohibited
Get your load balanced
Then you distribute it
Upgrade your talents
Keep the crowd riveted
Optimal, isn't it?
Nerdlife: you live in it

Nerdlife: you already dwell there
Frontalot is right beside you, thick glasses, no hair
I work a desk job, making rap songs for internet
I take my hacking with me in the off hours
Like I'm itinerant. Bindle stick, sack full of big noggin
Doesn't matter what I code in, keep it logged in
Got the sock puppet on Hacker News to back me up
I hack the traffic lights, traffic jams could fast erupt
I hack a game of checkers, move out of phase with the board
Hack reality, the rules are ignored
This is nerdlife, underscored by many aptitudes
I rap for you. Engineered my life like hackers do
And now I'm lead dev on rocking the mic
Hope you've got an intersection for your inspiration and you to collide
Hope it blows up and you fly
This life: you hack for yourself, so decide
