After all I've done for the council

They'd so soon be rid of me



Give me a million meat I'll only squander it — promise you —

Gambling, angling to shut down my entanglement. Honest to

Goodness, wish I could quit The Kingdom

Leave it. I'd sing like how you hear some people sing when

They're happy about something, hearts bursting open

But I find that each ascension, I get reborn holding tokens

Instead of gripping onto everlasting peace

Level one and fighting rabbits. Nothing for a feast

Nothing for the thirst. Armor is wack

A familiar bar basement, turning off the tap

For the rats. Stocking up on gum and string

Got a long life ahead, deja vu: what it may bring

Yet I can't put it down till the crystal breaks

And by that time I'm an old stick figure, got stakes

In the world as it stands, don't want to leave it

But I must — because I plague it, as the council would conceive it



Nuts to dyin'! I like lingering more

Just because the councilmembers think the monsters are a chore

And (just because I draw them into being) reach accord

That I should be banished? Yo I should be adored

What's more, their monarch's liberty problem persists

If I don't take matters up into my fists

My instruments and my cooking utensils

And cease the sorceress's reprehensible dissemblance:

Make her show her sausage. Fight it with my wand

Might sound a little dirty but the creatures like to spawn

And if I adventure at all, I find a few before long

Barely notice them now, I'm so sneaky and strong

So the council requests I desist? I'm unwilling

Take the basement to its bottom 'fore I vanish. Am I still in

The Kingdom though tempted by plexiglass?

You could give me a million meat, it won't last
