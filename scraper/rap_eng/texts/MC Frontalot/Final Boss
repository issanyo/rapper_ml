[Verse 1]
Yo! I crack the whip, you play the game
Every encounter that’s obstructionary comes in my name
So that you came to become obsessed with my location
Clues to my identity denied to the impatient
Step up -- I sense you’re on the precipice of something.
Me, I’m on the brink of delivering your lumpings:
Make you load your save up for the fifty fifth time,
Make you scroll through unskippable dialog lines
And you still ain’t any closer to discoverin why
Got technology for lackeys that can hover and fly
Got them other two guys in their sights and apt to wreck them
Give the beatdown to you quicker than your finger in Tekken

[Hook]
I crack the whip, you play the game...
You’re not gonna get the final boss tamed
I crack the whip, you play the game...
You’re not gonna get the final boss tamed
I crack the whip, you play the game...
You’re not gonna get the final boss tamed
I crack the whip, you play the game...
You’re never gonna get the final boss tamed

[Verse 2]
Elevated? I don’t give a drip if you celebrate it
Every time you level up it’s ‘cause I delegated
Your demise to the wrong size of minions
Got a bigger batch coming, statisticians
Got a dim opinion
Of your chance to survive
Make your time
I got a hundred billion of em and they’re standing in line
To make you shine light out of your special move hole
Cause you got hit so hard by the energy bolt
And it’s a moat you can’t cross, a key you can’t get
Ain’t done the right NPC subquest yet
Gotta collect bullshit that I done littered in the realm
Aim the whole game at you to fatigue and overwhelm

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Final boss is the be-all end-all class of society
Very exclusive, but not higher than me
All the sobriety
Of the day and age might prove indecent
Cause me to find and strangle the baby of Jackie Gleason
But then I’m evil and puissant
Unpleasant and bent on my ends
At the final reckoning
Too late to make amends
It’s too late to make friends
I’m infuriated already
Primest cut of minion
Double-corrugated and steady
Stands between Fe and Fi, so go whistle
Go huddle a hobo corpse, nestle his bristle
This towers as your obstacle - my will will never bend
Doesn’t matter how you struggle, never gets you past the end

[Hook]
I crack the whip, you play the game...
You’re not going to get the final boss tamed
I crack the whip, you play the game...
You’re not going to get the final boss tamed
I crack the whip, you play the game...
You’re not going to get the final boss tamed
I crack the whip, you play the game...
You’re not going to get the final boss tamed
I crack the whip, you play the game...
You’re not going to get the final boss tamed
I crack the whip, you play the game...
You’re not going to get the final boss tamed
I crack the whip, you play the game...
You’re not going to get the final boss tamed
I crack the whip, you play the game...
How could you defeat me, you don’t even know my name?

[Outro]
Who's my boss?
That's gonna cost you your last hitpoint
Who's in charge of this operation anyway?
..aw, boot skidoot, you gotta get outta here
