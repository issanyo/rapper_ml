[Verse 1: MC Frontalot]
They take the world over one node at a time
They put the seed in some software and make it shine
So the dimwitted among us grab tight and install
Put it right on the wall, and don't notice at all
That the celebration of a day impends
I want to note it on the calendar, I ready my pen
I get ahead of my friends in my haste, I let slip
That the zero day is coming, MC Front still ill-equipped
Boom how it hits you, when it comes
If you're touching on an interface you steady your thumbs
Since you might have to jump ship quick, the sting stuns
It isn't designed to destroy, it's just how it runs
And I sing fun songs but this here is a warning
That the exploit's open and it might sound corny
But I give a damn about the state of the Earth
Expect a hacker has to wreck it just to teach it what it's worth

[Hook: Jane Silence]
And on the first day, it's already too late, it's already too late, it's already too late
And on the first day, it's already too late, it's already too late, it's already too late
And on the first day, it's already too late, it's already too late, it's already too late
And on the first day, it's already too late, it's already too late, it's already too late
And on the first day, it's already too late, it's already too late, it's already too late

[Verse 2: Dual Core]
Press play, prepare as history is made:
"Largest hack in one day," all the headlines will say
All out of time, hear the chime from the buzzer
Found this bug on my own, no need for a fuzzer
"It's already too late," spreading as we planned
No need for the NO OPs, I know just where to land
Clearing out the registers, with pointers to my functions
Loaded to your memory and writing new instructions
Braindump I/O, siphoned out the eye holes
Enticed so I'm digging through the disassembled byte code
Push pop change order stack frame FILO
Filesystem inodes, all fall to my flow
Running over, there again I go
Self-propagation engine, polymorphic sideshow
Every network, we're found to get around
The exploit payload encoded in this sound

[Hook]

[Verse 3: YTCracker]
Man, cousin, I'm about to put in the work
Assert authority. Administrative access: crack this
If your patches back in the past, this
0day gets you on a root trip. TrueCrypt
Key file, I will keystyle shell code
Triple sevens all up on the ch mod
Shhh mode, how I'm keeping this here
Cause if I keep my game on tight my 0day lasts another year
You're a little bit late
I had that nfsd back in ninety-eight
And the DCOM bomb owned the Zone Alarm
So get your lip balm kitty; NEDM three fitty
Got them bots in every city with the Spamtec committee
And yt the almighty, zero day beats flying. And who's giant?
That's us. With the upstream plus, we're CAN-SPAM compliant

[Hook]

[Verse 4: MC Frontalot]
Yo, when it flips, new world is a permanent state
Cultivate paranoia cause the Huns at the gate
Are many millions strong, all arrive in a spate
YT Crack and Int80 been shipping them freight
All walls up to date, let them come, you can cope
Pwn the rug out from under you and sunder your hopes
Send a no points bulletin out; they're undiscovered
Eyes to the horizon! Not much longer undercover

[Hook x2]
