[Spoken: MC Frontalot and Lil' Negin]
Lil' Negin, it's just about bedtime
Ugh, can I just do this one last [?]
You need to go to bed
Ugh, do I have to?
Lil' Negin, you know your parents said that-
They're the worst, you realize they forgot my thirtieth birthday?
I know, you're mom warned me 'bout that
Like the thing about 'em is like, I can never get their approval, in life, or whatever, so it's like I'm always trying to achieve, and it gives me stomach aches.
Well, I really, I sympathize, and if your parents hadn't hired me to come and sympathize I would probably, I would still feel bad for you
Thanks sir, there's like a hole in my heart that could only be filled with parental love but I guess you'll have to do
