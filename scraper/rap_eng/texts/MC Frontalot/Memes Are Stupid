I mean, of COURSE memes are stupid. Maybe that's half the fun of them. But Front still insists that you all get off his lawn

Lyrics
Memes are dumb
Memes are dumb
Memes are dumb
If you’ve got something to say, say something

[MCF]
I say memes are dumb, not like idiots would post them
But like I experience my own giddiness the most when
Fodder for the flow’s penned and then exclaimed out
When I say dumb, I mean like I could take the same mouth
That I yap with and mute it like a commercial
None of what I meant to communicate achieves dispersal
And that’s what you’ve done, every dickbutt that you shitpost
Sewn your own trap shut, a riddle you didn’t get close
Just another echo of an image that you’ve seen
In another permutation on that same rectangle screen
Just a little more obscene or droll, according to your self-expression
And still it’s dumb, affording you this hellish lesson...

[Int80]
Int0x80, memes curator, a veteran and seasoned
But saddened that my rap just happens to be the voice of reason
"Memes are dumb?" That isn't mute, it's acute act of treason
Much of us anonymous, and believe it we are legion
Multiple in content, this "trouble" isn't gone yet
Maybe ‘cause these references are so cultural in context
Hey stranger, is your echo chamber commentary laughed off?
Look at the bigger picture of these contemporary snapshots
Behold the inevitable sentence structure that we muster
These dank memes change themes, grouping others into clusters
I thought as someone famous you'd like innovative language
Sorry to deny your pull request for retroactive changes

[MCF]
The captioning macro captures every residual stammer
Maybe you’re busy inventing a new semi-visual grammar
Maybe I’m too old to understand how talk works
But I’ve squeezed a living out of it on internet like rock squirts
And I’m not sure I’m ready to surrender
To the crowd-sourced crafting of every cultural fender bender
Dank is a good descriptor for wet caves and your reefer
And unattributed, yeah, if you’re going to stay such a griefer
If the thing of the moment captures your sentiment perfectly
And drawing a moustache on it is enhancing it worthily
Then don’t let me tell you exactly how to shut up
All your internet buddies think that you’re a cutup
