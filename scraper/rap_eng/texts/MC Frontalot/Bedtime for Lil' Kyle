[Spoken, MC Frontalot & Lil' Kyle]
Lil' Kyle?
Lil' Kyle I like, yeah
Lil Kyle, I was instructed very strictly to put you to bed at 7:45 and as you can see, the clock approaches 8:00 ever more steadily
Seven-fou-, that's such a weird time, yaknow
Your folks were strict and I have to carry their strictness into my duties
See, you're just, you're just gonna listen, you're just gonna push these rules down without asking anybody about 'em
What would society be were rules were not prevalent and strictly enforced?
What would it be without questioning those rules? Question 7:45, that's what I'm askin' you
I think we gotta question the whole structure of this, it hasn't been workin' so far
It's not workin' right now with your 7:45 PM
