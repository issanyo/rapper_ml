[Beefy]
So, what'd you guys think?

[Schaffer the Darklord]
I think that was not a good movie.

[MC Frontalot]
Wrong! It ruled. My new all-time favorite movie. Ever.

[Beefy]
How could you possible think that?

[STD]
Just awful.

[Front]
It was a little effects-heavy, but a very smart script. Well acted. Plausible.

[Beefy]
It was a preposterous film.

[STD]
Abysmal.

[Beefy]
It was asinine. It was... other big words for bad.

[STD]
I want my fourteen bucks back.

[Front]
You didn't pay for the ticket.

[Beefy]
I don't know why I saw it two times before this.
