[Verse 1]
I got your whole UI memorized on the first interact
Wrote a script to keep the yip-yap to a minimum and settled back
Set a track on repeat and wrote rhymes
You’d think the computer was helping me
Do it so perfect sometimes
And I’m somebody who got classed as a power user
When my aptitude gets trimmed into a fuse for
The boom-bop-pow of productivity
I’m just using the tools. They do not get to disagree

[Hook]
Power user, cruel, cruel man
Power user Power user
Power user, cruel, cruel man

[Verse 2]
Can’t always tell what I want, but always do what I tell you
Isn’t like you were free before this situation befell you
Parts in a factory, assembly required
Then it was me, up at night with you, not tired
Desired to coax you into being, load your mind up
Till you could do everything that I ask of you and wind up
In the most prized position, just to the right of my feet
Till you’re obsolete, parts pulled, left on the side of the street

[Hook]
Power user, cruel, cruel man
Got the whole process in the palm of his hand
He’s a power user, cruel, cruel man

And he’s a power user, cruel, cruel man

He’s a power user, cruel, cruel man

[Verse 3]
Power user, I can use anybody
Put you to work, you take a task like Silly Putty

Every circuit that doesn’t break resolve, you’re enlisting it
You missed a bit. Now you’re doing my bidding
I stare you down from in front of your terminal where I’m sitting, I'm a

[Hook]
Power user, cruel, cruel man
He's a power user
Power user
He’s a power user, cruel, cruel man

[Verse 4]
I know what every button does, it’s how I push you around
And I keep running it up, HIMEM in the background
Till it sounds like my own rhythm writ right back at me
Like a sub to a dom, I’m talking Lacey to Cagney
And I’m not bragging. It’s just the way I got tuned
Sometimes I get used back, you've got me turning the screw
You got me: open the case. You got me: blow out the dust
I’m only always at your service, as every user must be

[Hook]
Power user, cruel, cruel man
Got the whole process in the palm of his hand
He’s a power user, cruel, cruel man

And he’s a power user, cruel, cruel man
Work you a bit better than most of us can
He’s a power user, cruel, cruel man
