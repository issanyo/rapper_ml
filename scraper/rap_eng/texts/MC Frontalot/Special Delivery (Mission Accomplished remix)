I tried to go clean from protesting but I'm a recidivist
My government behaving with unlimited wickedness
In the interest of peace is how a liar wages war
Then clamors for more
I wish we had elections every day
Wave the ballot in the air like a sign when I say
Democracy delivered by the bomb and the gun
Is terror elsewhere in the world I'm from

(Uh yeah, I got a delivery for Iraq here, can Iraq sign for it? It's a large box of freedom
Sorry, I meant explosionsâ€” the freedom is back-ordered.)

Do you cheer for the once-and-for-all of an enemy
Whose hand our man Don was on in '83
But who now exemplifies all evil
That's what you get for shaking hands with people
Who represent the vast and sinister interests of industry
We protect the free trade world, so don't dare try to stop us
We deliver them bullets and sell them their coffins

(Hello U.S. senate? Yeah, I have a hundred copies of the Abu Ghraib Prisoners Gone Wild DVD
There's also your bonus Abu Ghraib Prisoners Gone Wild: Totally Spring Break. Sign here.)

And I wish that I could afford the ear of Bush the second
I'd ask is it your favorite philosopher who recommended
Invading and exterminating all who defy us
Crying out justice but seeking out triumphs?
Wasn't your christ unbeloved of empires?
One nailed his ass to a post; he expired!
A terrorist, as Roman evidence showed
Put down like a retard on the death row
In Texas, I guess "tough luck," right George?
Ain't that how every war gets scored?
Big gun wins, winner gets a free turn
Enemy after enemy burns
Are you listening sir? Or did your mind drift
To the next country in your Axis
To all the cool bomb drops you get to call
Delivery fresh from the fourth Reich to y'all
