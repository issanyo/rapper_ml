[Verse 1]
Listen, I'll tell you that Frontalot is incredible
Even recommended to rock the mic like instead of a
Silence, you'd have me fronting into the amplifier
Point with the thumb, at which MC to admire
I got hi-res images of drum sounds that I loop
You get to listen to them and to me too
How fortunate y'all are to get to bask under my glow
The MC, humble conduit to nerdcore flow

[Hook]
Now it's time for a little braggadocio
While I swing my arms like Ralph Macchio
Now it's time for a little braggadocio
While I swing my arms like Ralph Macchio

(And the trophy for Most Awesomest Rapper... Ever, goes to...
Sorry, I'm having some trouble with the envelope...
Holy shit— it's MC Frontalot!)

[Verse 2]
I stand 77 feet tall, I got eight balls
And all o' y'all are subject to my thrall
I act appalled when in receipt of less than the highest honor
Some day I'll be both revered and passé like Madonna
I'm all in effect, people tend to genuflect
When I enter rooms, cause all dopeness is subsumed
I spell the doom of the hip-hop subgenre you used to prefer
This geekish rhythm intersection
With the predilections that I've incurred
You say "Word?"
With a surfeit of beats I'm unlikely to run out
Plus I'm so bright it's like redundant to have the sun out
And one out of each ten brags is hyperbolic
It's all inconsequential, cause you're just here to hear my tongue frolic

[Hook]
Now it's time for a little braggadocio
While I swing my arms like Ralph Macchio
Now it's time for a little braggadocio
While I swing my arms like Ralph Macchio

[Verse 3]
Pistachios ain't that great, I thought I'd mention 'em
Distinctive from how awesome I am, my rhyme is venturesome
Then, the dumb luck of it all, I discover
Other rappers already braggin'
But Front's on sync, no laggin'!
Keep slang in files that recombinate to add weight to fat tracks
I overlaid this very vocal via gums that flap
I sap clock cycles from the sucker MCs as they struggle to parse
And yet the Front's no farce!
Some awesome massive aspiration stationed itself in my head:
To be the dopest innovation since the slicing of bread
Instead of simply relying on my insistence to prove
That every twist of my tongue is another radical move
(Which it is, obviously.)

[Hook]
Now it's time for a little braggadocio
While I swing my arms like Ralph Macchio
Now it's time for a little braggadocio
While I swing my arms like Ralph Macchio
Now it's time for a little braggadocio
While I swing my arms like Ralph Macchio
Now it's time for a little braggadocio
While I swing my arms— (while I swing 'em)
