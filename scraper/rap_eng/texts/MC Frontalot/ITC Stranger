It's '77 and you work for the corporation
Delivering nostalgia in translation
Nouveau renewed for the disco era
Someday you'll notice them use it evoking a moment that's nearer
To later, the 80s, the future
When the end of the cold war's about to microcompute ya
When your own adventure's chosen by you
Some say mom'll quit smoking (those are liars)
Those are monsters from inverted places, they're bad for your health
You just delivered a typeface and named it after yourself

And they took it to outlines that aren't in the family
Bulb of the G receiving a violent flattening
Till its stress is ruined but its counter isn't
Maybe back in the past you had a vision, Ed Besquiat
Are you nostalgic for that?
