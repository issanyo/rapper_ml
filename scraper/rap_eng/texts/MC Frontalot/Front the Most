[Verse 1]
MC Frontalot is not installed
So don't call 800-FRONT-4-ALL
I'm off the ball of wax to rock the rough tracks
Thumbtacks all up in the mix, so relax
You know I hax a beat together like a slasher rampage
MC Frontalot, inundated by the rhythm arrays
Some days I brag, some days I boast
24/7, I front the most

[Verse 2]
You wouldn't think that I would front
Most days, do nothing but
Sit around dropping the lyrics into the drum cuts
Buts, ands, ors? I hear naysay
Don't play! MC Front'll get offended, go away
Hey, there ain't no need to be real
Honk-honking on the sample like a trained m-seal
We all seek a second stepping from the post
24/7 I front, I front the most

[Verse 3]
What am I, wrecking every break beat?
That could take eight weeks
Only ever stop fronting to smoke bowls, take leaks
And sleep. I catch a cat nap
Sit in front the mic so much that my ass chaps
Gaps [in the tape]: I was fronting in the other room
Boogalooing. Well, I wasn't, but I wanted to and
I'm going to rock the mic day and night till I give up the ghost
24/7, I front the most
