Say to me
"buona sera" cause I'm jacking beats from girls
And I could shine up the apple like they be rubbing the pearls
I squirrel rhymes in my cheeks yo I spit them at will
Be rolling louis prima like a 50 dollar bill
Still feeling the bump in my nose and those who jock me
Get this advice: 7-11 is selling coffee
I know, I see you need to go all night
That girl you're taking home ain't going to sleep without a fight
Right there I seen her in the club (yup) cutting it up
The way her nose is bleeding, she did a rail not a bump
Something else: she ain't holding so I hope you is
Cause if she's crashing you ain't about to drop the jiz

She's all up in your cabinets pilfering your little bro's ritalin
She be burning it down while you're fiddling
Acetylene torch to the tube, that's why her teeth look all fucked
But on the other hand that isn't the only thing she sucks
You gotta be giving this girl at least a couple of days
You been sniffing it too
So it ain't like you're gonna be sleeping anyway (hey!)
So you say: baby, why you shaking? is it me?
Naw, she been twitching in that manner ever since 1993
And she weighs eighteen pounds dripping wet
She keeps on growling at you, I'd take her to the vet
Get her a little ket - uh, I mean, hold on, one at a time
First crush those no-doz up fine, then cut her another line
This girl does 10 times more crank than you could if you tried
And if I took even half that I'd die
