I'm gonna be your man (gonna be your man)
You're my biggest fan, I gotta give a little something back
I'm gonna be your man (gonna be your man)
See, you don't even gotta ask

I know, you don't want me to die
But you need that lung pretty bad, and I'm the guy
In the 10-county area
Ain't had malaria yet
Plus the blood type (red)
It gets scarier: fed
On the corn & you born a vegan
Fate has indicated that I'm the man you're seeking
Now you're freaking out, and that's okay
Having that much of another man inside you
Isn't going to make you gay
And play along for a second, you could get what I got:
The inexplicable ability to front. A lot!
An inexhaustible nerdcore flow
The charisma to draw eight people to a live show
Myopic vision, and an oversized head
A girl at a convention told me once that I was good in bed
Plus I often meet a crowd and am greeted without booing
Think of all the respiration you'll be doing!
Stop spazzing! it's just a lung
Quit pointing out how I already donated you one
Frontalot is sick of breathing, it's fucking boring
All the time I've got the asthma, and the snoring
And I ought to level with you
The feds have got a warrant for a sample of my tissue
They say I misused a certain substance & they'll get me
So I'mma pass the lung along and get stepping
Too late to protest, here comes the anesthesia
And I'm gonna be your man, to dole the lung that you're in need of
I'm just gonna. Discussion over. Drop it
Hmmm... you look a little drowsy, here's the next topic:
Please lie motionless to indicate you wouldn't mind
If the doctor also swapped your 14 inches for my five
