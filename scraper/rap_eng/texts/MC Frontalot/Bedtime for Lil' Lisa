[Spoken: MC Frontalot & Lil' Lisa]
Lil' Lisa?
Yeah?
Do you ever struggle with the dichotomy between your divine self and your base self, while you're trying to get to sleep?
Yeah, I do
Every now and then, I feel a ping, I feel a divine ping, but then I think, then I second guess it, and then I burp
Do you wanna go to bed? Is it bedtime?
I don't know, do you have a blanket?
I do have a blanket, oh my god I can't believe I tried to put you to bed with no blanket
I'm not a very good baby sitter
Well
You didn't wanna say it
No you're a great baby sitter, you're getting better
Is this a horse blanket?
