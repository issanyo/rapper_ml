Another night alone again
And even though I don't really need a man
I go to my lab, start creating…
My perfect new boyfriend

I'm done with dudes not so woke
Or cocky bros with big egos
Waiting by the phone for it to beep
“WYD” from some dumb creep

See no time for wondering
If he’ll call back or start ghosting
No time for tears in the lean cuisine
I control who I'm making

Dream lover? Gonna make him real!
Im gonna kill cause I got the skills
So off to the lab to create my guy
The best dudes ever are DIY

Paper Maché Boo
Cut and Paste Dude
Stretch are you
Boyfriend Material?

Thread, hot glue
Scissors cut through
Stretch are you
Boyfriend Material?


Open the trunk of my spare parts
Of all the men who broke my heart
Ooh this chest is really ripped!
Sew it to this arm. Biceps so big!

Snap in legs, he's my Ken Doll
My Gumby man is flexible
To the stretch machine! Gonna make him tall!
Pop on his skull, then two eyeballs

Sew on lips there pillow soft
All the better to get me off
Then one by one i'll pick his teeth
Cause men look better when they’re smiling

Wrapped skin tight from head to toe
Mold his buns like mounds of dough
Then pull the lever and oh surprise!
OMG He’s ALIVE!


Now Im only swiping left
Cause mama deserves the best
Put them lames up on a shelf
Oh here’s my man!


[MC Frontalot]

Woke up calibrated just like this:
An Adonis among the sophisticates
But I missed the bits where I put it all together...
Did I do a lot of work? Doesn’t matter whether

I’m perfect now, let the past be over
Three limbs got tats, each says YOLO
Got three grams of fat on my whole body
Dare I check in the pants? Actually not shoddy

Bouncing off the kneecaps
Butt muscles rippling. I see that
Smile and it’s more charismatic
Than six Brad Pitts stapled together in a panoramic

Damn it! Just caught sight
Of the person with whom I’m about to spend my life
And he’s just my type and he’s there in the mirror
Like I’m built for me and that’s what I’m here for

Stretch for me
Stretch for me
Im better off alone
