(Yo when I hit it I hit:)
L shift-O to the quote and then dollar
If you know the dir of the nerdcore rhyme, you holla
I hit L shift-O to the quote and then dollar
If you know the dir of the nerdcore rhyme, you holla
I hit L shift-O to the quote and then dollar
If you know the dir of the nerdcore rhyme, you holla

Nerd-ho! Warm the mic up (yo)
We 'bout to strike up
This band of nebbishes
Who cultivate nebulous fetishes
The FPS, RPG or MMPOG
Any obsession to blather over by blog
Or BBS. Step and possess, hone thy geekishness
Your frame rate and frags to date both impress
And yes, your affinity for a certain site of some amusement
(a classically adorned parlor of fun where you let loose pent-
Up cent pieces to partake of flicker-dramas)
Gets you branded a sniper bitch or rocket mama-
Humper (damn!), dude! they said you're cheatin'
But with coins in hand you got more game than Wil Wheaton
When's the MC 'bout to get funny? I'm losin' patience
Wanna know how the pants contain one wang and two NeXT stations
And a Tandy hole, where he plays Whack-a-Mole with the toilet paper
Frontalot can rock the PA song at the lowest common denominat'
Not as a hater of culture or lacker in class
But an expert at math
Accounting how the Penny Arcade 0\/\/nZz j00r aZz
