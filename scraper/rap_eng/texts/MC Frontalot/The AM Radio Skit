I have, I don't know what, like maybe 300 different file cabinets.

[Schaffer the Darklord]
300 file cabinets?

[Front]
Yeah, at least.

[STD]
That's a good number. I mean, that's good number for you. it's, uh, not nearly enough for my work.

[Producer]
And we're back from commercial in ten.

[Front]
I was thinking it's too many and I would reduce.

[STD]
I think you're right. I think that's a good idea.

[Front]
Just because of maintenance.

[Producer]
In one.

[Front]
And, you know, some of these things are from the forties. And we're back! If you're just joining us, this is the late night, all night, AM radio truth report. I'm your host. We have with us this hour paralegican and author...

[STD]
And published author.

[Front]
And also published author, Schaffer T. Darklord. Thank you for joining us.

[STD]
You are welcome.

[Front]
That last caller brought up a good point, I thought, it was...

[STD]
Well, absolutely.

[Front]
...the encounter

[STD]
If these things can actually be proven to be memory implants, then it stands to reason that an implantation method would exist in, or in the vicinity of, barns or barnyards.

[Front]
I see we have another one blinking. Caller, go ahead.

[Caller]
Yeah, hey, I love the show, I just want to say that scare goats are just real. Like literally, truly real. It's just a fact. I mean, on my mom's farm we used to yell at them and knock them over, and I...

[Front]
Ugh. I'm getting a lot of calls like that. I know out there we've got a lot of really smart listeners, a lot of very aware listeners, very resistant to things like "official documentation," very resistant to brain wave interference. But this thing has got to be a hoax.

[STD]
I've said for years, shadow government already has scare goat related dis-info-hypnology.
