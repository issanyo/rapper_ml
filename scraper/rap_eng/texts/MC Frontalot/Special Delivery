I tried to go clean from protesting, but I’m a recidivist
My government behaving with unlimited wickedness
“In the interest of peace” is how a liar wages war
Then clamors for more
I wish we had elections every day
Wave the ballot in the air like a sign when I say
Democracy delivered by the bomb and the gun
Is terror elsewhere on the world I’m from

Do you cheer for the once-and-for-all of an enemy
Whose hand our man Don was on in ‘83
But who now exemplifies all evil?
That’s what you get for shaking hands with people
Who represent the vast and sinister interests of industry
We protect the free trade world, so don’t dare try to stop us
We deliver them bullets and sell 'em their coffins

And I wish that I could afford the ear of Bush the Second;
I’d ask, is it your favorite philosopher who recommended
Invading and exterminating all who defy us
Crying out justice but seeking out triumphs?
Wasn’t your Christ unbeloved of empires?
One nailed his ass to a post; he expired!
A terrorist, as Roman evidence showed
Put down like a retard on the death row
In Texas; I guess “tough luck,” right George?
Ain’t that how every war gets scored?
Big gun wins. Winner gets a free turn
Enemy after enemy burns
Are you listening, sir? Or did your mind drift
To the next country in your axis
To all the cool bomb drops you get to call:
Delivery fresh from the Fourth Reich to y’all
