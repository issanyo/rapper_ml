[Intro: MC Lars]
Hey Lars, how do you make any money if you give away your mixtape for free?
I'm really glad you asked Ollie, we've got t-shirts they're -

Black and Yellow, Black and Yellow, Black and Yellow, Black and Yellow
Uh-huh, you know what they are
Black and Yellow, Black and Yellow, Black and Yellow, Black and Yellow

[Verse 1: MC Lars]
My boy Front is always managing his vocal takes
Playing up his nerd persona every day he integrates
You wanna hear a rap about a game from '82?
Good news! MC Frontalot's got songs for you

Full of rhymes that he drops, pretty hot, make em rock
With the style he concocts: Nerdcore Hip-Hop
Flashlight on his head, his homeboy went and started it
Grabbing your allowances, he knows how to market it

[Verse 2: MC Frontalot]
My man Lars has got the talent and he flaunts it
And he drops phat hits every one-hundredth concept
The onset of his rapping is blunt
It beats you up in the manner that he called post-punk

You know the fans can't get enough, always holler for more
Think they're even louder than they were before the previous encore
Just hope they let him off stage soon
Vital business in the back where the hoodies are strewn

Come on -

[Hook 1: MC Lars]
Ya bro, we got t-shirts and they're
Black and Yellow, Black Yellow, Black and Yellow, Black and Yellow
Yeah dude, different colors, such as
Green and Purple, Green and Purple, Green and Purple, Green and Purple
This is indie rocket science and it's
Horris Records, Horris Records, Horris Records, Horris Records
Good luck chasing royalties Mr
Wiz Khalifa, Wiz Khalifa, Wiz Khalifa, Wiz Khalifa

[Verse 3: MC Frontalot]
You try to sell music - they look at you funny
It's not a transaction that necessitates money
Not with the true cunning of the kids in the know
But you look at them cheering notice what? They don't sew

Don't go to the print shop and silkscreen their own
Yet they're always needing something to cover the torso
That's why MC Lars and I provide a product
Sit atop high fashion inventory!

[Verse 4: MC Lars]
You got it! Costume glasses, mouse pads, robot USBs
Captains are we! Of what? Industry!
Rockefeller, Adam Smith, Rock a cellar just like this
Rock a crowd of rowdy kids, so Frontalot tell me this

Is it all about the Washingtons or all about the art?
Indie rap - we're into that, following our hearts
But part of the job, I mean the other part from caring
Is taking t-shirt money like we're modern Robert Barrons!

[Hook 2: MC Lars]
Ya bro, we got t-shirts and they're
Black and Yellow, Black Yellow, Black and Yellow, Black and Yellow
Yeah dude, different colours, such as
White and orange, White and orange, White and orange, White and orange
This is indie rocket science and it's
Horris Records, Horris Records, Horris Records, Horris Records
Good luck chasing royalties Mr
Wiz Khalifa, Wiz Khalifa, Wiz Khalifa, Wiz Khalifa

[Verse 5: MC Fronalot + MC Lars]
Oh we know every fabric weight,every drop ship price
Every line-screen density - designs are precise
Cotton woven so nice, blind eyes to child labor
You as the consumer are the lucky money saver

And we savour all you're savvy as it leads you to our wares
Up in the gilded age of geekery we've so sneakily prepared
This foolproof method of making just the shirts you want
With my top-hat and my monocle and your money I abscond

[Verse 6: MC Lars + MC Fronalot]
You see Horris Records harvesting the forests near your home
For the paper in the liner notes of every disc you own
You should have known that our sweat shirts were pure baby seal
Go ahead and treat yourself, you love the way it feels!

The appeals of the audience: Get back on stage
Where you at? By the merch booth trying to get paid
Got a hundred people covered, though their arms stay bare
The only way we get to do it - check the logos they wear!

Because -

[Hook 3: MC Lars]
Guess what! At the merch booth, we got
Shirts and honeys, Shirts and honeys, Shirts and honeys, Shirts and honeys
Please stop - come and buy stuff, we need
Health insurance, Health insurance, Health insurance, Health insurance
This is indie rocket science and it's
Horris Records, Horris Records, Horris Records, Horris Records
Apologies for ruining your track Mr
Wiz Khalifa, Wiz Khalifa, Wiz Khalifa, Wiz Khalifa

[Outro: MC Lars + MC Frontalot]
My man Lars is in the t-shirt business
My boy Front is in the t-shirt business
Look at us! We're in the t-shirt business
I thought we were musicians, what is this!

MC Lars is in the t-shirt business
Frontalot is in the t-shirt business
Both of us are in the t-shirt business
I thought that we were rappers, what is this!
