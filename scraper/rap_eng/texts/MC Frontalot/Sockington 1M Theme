10 meow
20 goto 10

He's just a regular cat, don't mean that as a jazz term
Yeah, sure, you can pet him if you got the password
Last heard out of the mouth was meow
Got a bigger vocabulary? typing it out
With socks for fingers, caps-lock stuck
Count it lucky that a cat can use a keyboard. what?
Count it lucky that the fatty pay the bill on time;
Soon as internet go down, you're all in misery. Why?
Cause you love to believe in the two-tone cat
There's an army of you out there answering back
There's a seven digit number, count it up from that
Dust mote, you get bat. tell him where the tuna at
He got a spot on a chair where he deposited the pants fur
He got a regular stare like he's stalking on the answer
To the question: when's the kibble coming back?
Though on any other topic, he'll be  easy to distract
