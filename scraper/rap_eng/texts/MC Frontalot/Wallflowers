Do it. Just do it
Do it. Just do it

I’ve got a new dance called The Margaret Thatcher
It’ll get in your pants, you’d better call the dispatcher
Of deliverers of increased pants awesomeness
Get the awesomest pants they offer
Preposterous shoes are also required for the moves
Although sensible footwear or barefoot behooves
And all attire’s optional
You only ever do it when there’s nobody watching you

(Do it.)
Do The Margaret Thatcher
(Just do it.)
Do The Margaret Thatcher, y’all
(Do it.)
Do The Margaret Thatcher
(Just do it.)
Do The Margaret Thatcher, y’all

Here’s a little something for the
Wallflowers in the room
All my people at the party for whom
The dance don’t come natural
Enhance your stature. Fall
Into the routine they call
The Margaret Thatcher, y’all

Do The Margaret Thatcher
Do The Margaret Thatcher, y’all

Step One:
Wiggle, wobble, wriggle
Coddle your young
Intensify your ennui
Then before you get done
Put your left foot over to the left if you dare
Then pretend you got scared
And point at your hair

Step Two:
Elevate everything up
Increase any numbers that you’re in control of
Then Skip to The Lou
Then stand stock still
Then illustrate for everyone your ultimate skill

Do it. Just do it

Ill is the manner of the dancing you do
Calibrate it so that anybody’d think that you’re too
Intensely unhealthy to move like that
Take the multiple indignities: a dance floor fact
Don’t retract unless you’re starting a move
And don’t begin a motion unless you follow it through
And don’t do anything I wouldn’t condone
Except a dance named after a villainous crone

Here’s a little something for the
Wallflowers in the room
All my people at the party for whom
The dance don’t come natural
Enhance your stature. Fall
Into the routine they call
The Margaret Thatcher, y’all

Do The Margaret Thatcher
(Just do it.)
Do The Margaret Thatcher, y’all
(Do it.)
Do The Margaret Thatcher
(Just do it.)
Do The Margaret Thatcher, y’all
(Do it.)
Do The Margaret Thatcher
(Just do it.)
Do The Margaret Thatcher, y’all
(Do it.)
Do The Margaret Thatcher
(Just do it.)
Do The Margaret Thatcher, y’all

Do The Margaret Thatcher, y’all
