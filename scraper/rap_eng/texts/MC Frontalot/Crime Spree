Wha-Oh! Right. Time for a crime spree

MC Frontalot: the arch criminal for some reason not
Sought by authorities; though I've been running wild for days
They’s surely going to track me down
I’m the #1 menace for miles around
With the littering, the loitering, the mattress tags
All the piratated mp3s I grabs [arrrr]
All the cable I stole, certain bathroom wall I wrote on
I’m so cruel & cold, you put a coat on
I even cheat on my tax!
“From this life of crime there could be no turning back.”
Riding all around on my bike with no helmet
Commit mail fraud whenever I see a mailman
Got a jaywalking ticket
I crumpled it up!
Still bump the bootleg cause I’m hanging tough [we’re ruff!]

Crime spree that I’m on
Breaking the law until the break of the dawn
Then I’ll break it again, then I’ll break it some more
(MC Frontalot, you’re so hardcore!)
Crime spree that I’m on
Breaking the law until the break of the dawn;
Yo, it seems like I break it all the time
(This MC led a life of crime.)

Harder than a criminal’s supposed to be. Most of the
FBI heard of this MC
Called them up just to check, “This here’s the Frontalot and I expect
That y’all are tracking me down, cat n’ the mouse
Gearing it up for some chasing around
I mean, you name it I done it:
Slandering, pandering, a couple hundred
Uncleared samples I rock per track.”
FBI’s like “We’re busy, we’ll call you back.”
Yeah, if you can find me! Leave a trail violated statutes behind me
Winding in an impossible wake, ‘cause hard as I am
I don’t think I could take
Prison for even a day. “In that case you should live lawfully.”
Too late!
