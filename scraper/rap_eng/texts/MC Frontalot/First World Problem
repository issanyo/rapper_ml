[Verse 1]
Nerd rap infests your internet, you left a trap, but it's empty
MC Frontalot took a gape but the bait wasn't tempting
Ending up uncaged and at large
To talk smack at you through the networking appliance that's in charge
Of every drip of your attention
Yo, when mine goes out I've got to log in just to mention
My disappointment at the interruption of convenience
I mean just: a lot left, but none up in between this
Couple of minutes here and a couple of minutes later
It's an outrage, at the price I paid
These dictators Of my leisure rule with an iron fist
Has anybody ever been so put upon as this?

[Hook]
Your GPS run out of battery (first world problem)
Got to wake up Saturday (first world problem)
You just delayed a honeymoon (first world problem)
Pledge season's coming soon (first world problem)
Half your friend list is spam accounts (first world problem)
And your center channel speaker's out (first world problem)
Your center channel speaker's out (I can hear that it's not on)

[Verse 2]
Muffy, my hair regrowth cream is mostly ineffective
And I'm struggling to keep this in perspective
But I feel like a massive injustice occurred
Says "regrows hair" on the tube (in the words)
In a third — or maybe a quarter — of all users
I must have got swindled, is it a fault? Of whose is?
Oooh, Muffy, Muffy, I had all the servants tortured
Did you keep them on retainer? Do you got some more on order?
Cause I can't comb my hair on my own no more
I got accustomed to the lifestyle, sniffed upon the spore
And it molded up my innards, made the blood turn blue
Muffy, Muffy, there's a revolution; what we're gonna do?

[Hook]
Misplaced the Ambien (first world problem)
Left a participle dangling (first world problem)
You're scheduling your root canal (first world problem)
Your grad schooling had no rationale (first world problem)
You didn't like your appetizer (first world problem)
Your yacht got capsized (a first world problem)

[Bridge]
The living conditions of the American masses (that's you)
Are swiftly deteriorating
Our generation is going through the final convulsions
Of the dying world of capitalism
That's what it says here
And if you don't believe that pamphlet
Try this one:

[Verse 3]
Now while our capitalism is in a minor kerfuffle
You have to hustle before the fates come, reshuffle
Rustle up another couple grievances and air 'em
You can laugh about it later (maybe needed while despairing)
For the moment though, you ordered half caf, didn't get it
There was no TV set when you jetted; Internet resetted
Itself just as I was in the middle
Of tournament play, and so I suffered from transmittal
Interruption. Completely ruined my day
MC Frontalot's a jackass, that's all I'm trying to say
People buy CDs in these days of disaster
So poor me: I have to be a professional rapper

[Hook]
No bubbles in the soda cup (first world problem)
App crashed when you loaded up (first world problem)
Phone's OS is outta date (first world problem)
Colors won't calibrate (first world problem)
They never stock the snack you want (first world problem)
Caught herpes from a celebutante (first world problem)
Caught herpes from a celebutante (What a magnificent creature)

Got wallhacked in PVP (first world problem)
Oh no, HD-DVD (first world problem)
Pixels aren't perfect square (first world problem)
Your favorite rapper isn't debonair (first world problem)
You own too many underwear (first world problem)
And you're not much of a millionaire (first world problem)
Not much of a millionare ... in the first world
