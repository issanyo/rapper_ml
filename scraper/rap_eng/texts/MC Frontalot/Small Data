Got to listen to the data in the day to day...

Some data sets are easy to explore:
Direction of the elevator & its current floor;
Whether this kettle is whistling or not;
What I brought in my pocket -- but what about what I forgot?
That’s a little difficult. I wish I had a robot
To calibrate perception and result. There’s a whole lot
Involved. And I’ve got to make sense
Out of this array before the set decays:
The oxygen load of every red cell in the system;
Every single fanfiction ever written;
Every bit of space dust and its velocity
By the way, everything changes constantly
But I’m pretty dedicated. I’ll collect it all
Frontalot got a little optimism installed
Got it dialed to the wall, now I think I’m omniscient
Data-driven to decision, I’m on a mission
To take a listen to the interrelationships
Twixt every locus at which any datum sits
Then, when comprehension prevails
We’ll see how big it is: all in the details
