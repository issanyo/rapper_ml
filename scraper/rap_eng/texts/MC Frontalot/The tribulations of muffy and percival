[Bob Moseley]
Muffy and Percival build a home

[Sara Benincasa]
The contractor called again. He said the reclaimed redwood is going to be more expensive

[MC Frontalot]
Well, that's ridiculous. Why won't he email me a quote?

[Sara]
He says to call him with a fax number

[Front]
Did you tell him we got rid of the fax line last month?

[Sara]
It was a voice mail

[Front]
I thought it was like a boutiquey thing that he didn't have a website

[Sara]
God! Sometimes I just want to kill myself

[Bob]
Muffy and Percival prepare a meal

[Sara]
Put the kevlar glove on! You're going to cripple yourself

[Front]
I broke the shell again

[Sara]
Just go slowly

[Front]
I don't see why your juicer can handle 32 kinds of vegetables but there's no machine for shucking

[Sara]
You've never understood food

[Bob]
Muffy and Percival throw a party

[Front]
Evite is down

[Sara]
What?!

[Front]
It's down, it won't load

[Sara]
What? What? What? What?

[Front]
It's OK. It's going to be OK

[Sara]
[unintelligble]

Muffy. Muffy. I understand it's not OK now, but it will soon

[Sara]
I can't see. I can't... what are we going to do?

[Front]
I suppose we could DM everybody one by one

[Sara]
Yeah. Or, I think there's a flock of carrier pigeons in the... [laughter]

[Bob]
Muffy and Percival have their flight canceled

[Front]
It says there is another one at 6:30

[Sara]
Into JFK at what? Midnight?

[Front]
Oh God, it's probably going to be just terrible in the taxi line

[Sara]
Well, you'll call a service. We don't live in freakin' Bangladesh

[Bob]
Muffy and Percival visit the third world

[Sara]
Oh, we're not going there

[Front]
The 4G coverage is atrocious

[Sara]
Where?

[Front]
The third world, darling

[Sara]
Ugh, no, I don't think so. I won't even go to Cleveland

[Front]
Also terrible 4G coverage
