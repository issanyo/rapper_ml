Set up the mics, turn up the volume
Everybody present, say "here" when I call you:
Schaffer?

[Schaffer the Darklord]
Yep

[Front]
Beef?

[Beefy]
Hello

[Front]
Bought three movie tickets, got the front row
Act I

[STD]
Our plucky hero's home town:
Middle Americana, not a problem to be found
A single dad of one son with a dog just trying his
Best to make ends meet as a disaster scientist
One day he stumbles upon some horrifying evidence
Our hero decides, "I must inform the president."

[Beefy]
"Even though you seem to know exactly what you talk about
I don't think at this point in the plot I am going to hear you out."
But Washington's in fallout, can't return to my home
There's flash floods, earthquakes. I pick up the red phone
"You get this ragtag team made of washed out marines
And Dr. Jennie Marie, she studies weather extremes."

[Jane Silence]
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster

[Front]
Act II. Molten lava is chasing them around
Big blue bolts of lightning spring up from underground
But our hero and his team have some hope for a cure:

[STD]
"If we can just get this crew into the center of the earth
We can install a nuclear device then detonate it
My findings indicate that this will stave off devastation."

[Beefy]
"I might have given in to my pride (that is my sin)
But take this check and shake my hand, 'cause you always trust a  Whitesican."

[STD]
"Sir, you won't regret it. Launch your finest satellite
Arm it with a laser canon aimed upon the blast site
To activate the nuke. But the clock is counting down
We need to act fast as our time is running out."

[Front]
Meanwhile: hurricanes, tidal waves, floods
Sun flares cause it to seem to rain blood

[Beefy]
The President just got crushed by an asteroid

[Front]
And the plucky hero's son?

[STD]
"Run faster, boy!"

[Jane]
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster

[Front]
Last Act. Son makes it, dog doesn't
Odds may be stacked against the team. They discuss it

[STD]
A last ditch effort hangs heavy on our hero's mind:
"Blowing up the planet is the only hope for humankind."
And to his leading lady, "There is something I must say..."

[Beefy]
"Hey, you and me can wait, I want to have another yesterday
Sources say the Kremlin can take us into orbit
Go to space, fix the lasers. And the earth: we can restore it."

[STD]
"That's it! A crazy plan, but we have to try
The time is nigh, gather up supplies, we must survive!"

[Front]
They head out for Russia in a little rowboat
Get menaced by glaciers, almost bite it but don't
At the last moment a decision to be made:
There's the love or the boy, only one can get saved

[STD]
If he thinks too long

[Front]
Whole globe is in peril

[Beefy]
If you don't shed a tear at the end

[Front]
Your heart's sterile

[STD]
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers

[STD & Jane]
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
It's a disaster
It's a disaster
Oh no
