[Verse 1: Mega Ran]
It's a typical Sunday night, can't sleep
Thinkin' bout the coming week
And all the promises I can't keep
Cuz there ain't enough seconds in a minute
Minutes in an hour
Hours in the day
For work, when I wanna play
My lady thinking I don't show her respect
But she don't know I got games I haven't opened up yet, now that's love
Every Thursday I'm cooped in a packed club
Praying this ain't the day that one of em' act up
And throw a bottle onstage rolling under my foot
Causing a fall, caught on tape that gets hundreds of looks on YouTube - got screws loose, runnin' like second hand
Then I get home and realize I didn't do my lesson plans
Everyone envies the life of Mega Ran
It's not all good, but I count my blessings fam
Cause it's hard to find a job, let alone one you wanna do
I hit the daily double, and came up on two
Three if you count a loyal significant other
This didn't seem as hard when I lived with my mother
But I got tired of hearin' it - "go on and get serious"
Now I be flowin' like, regular periods
Growing as a lyricist in my six years in this
And I learned so much - so I think it's time to grow up
Packin my lunch, Doritos, and cold cuts
One more pay cut - and I'm out - time to wake up!

[Chorus: Mega Ran]
If ya don't move, then ya don't eat
So ya better get up on your feet
It's a new day, running outta time
So ya gotta grind, time to rise and shine

If ya don't move, then ya don't eat
So ya better get up on your feet
It's a new day, running outta time
So ya gotta grind, time to rise and shine

[Verse 2: MC Frontalot]
No snooze!
You wanted to be a rapper now you got what you were after
Today don't wanna? Well you have to
Grab the mic and make noises into it
You and the beat get intimate, send a report to the syndicate
Indicating that you'll have a track ready soon
Comment thread's incredulous but replies swoon
"When, when?" But then *alarm* oh no, I slipped
Into a dream, didn't even get a single rhyme writ
And the rig isn't equipped and there's a sound check in an hour
You know how you sometimes meet a nerd rapper who hasn't showered
Well that was probably me, I beg your forgiveness
It's only through your largess that I'm even allowed to live this
Dream out
So when I'm cussing about my wack boss
Old Man Front running his sweat shop, take a sad pause
Shed a lone tear, and then remind me
That every day I wake up is a day dawned kindly

[Chorus: Mega Ran]
If ya don't move, then ya don't eat
So ya better get up on your feet
It's a new day, running outta time
So ya gotta grind, time to rise and shine

If ya don't move, then ya don't eat
So ya better get up on your feet
It's a new day, running outta time
So ya gotta grind, time to rise and shine

[Verse 3: Mega Ran]
Wait up don't tell me it's time wake up
Snoring like a bulldozer going like the brakes cut
Eye boogers starting to cake up
Six thirty sharp, I gotta pick the pace up
Get my face up, off the pillow it ain't much
Time for a meal so I just grab the K-cup
French roast and get ghost and take lunch
If I'm late once, more I'm gone, case shut
Netflix was on shouldn't have stayed up
Last night, watching Jimi tear the stage up
Hop the train just missed the late bus
Get a taxi he taxed me, 28 bucks
Runnin' late but maybe I can make up
Time - stay after hours, and face up
To the music, no excuses straight up
I mean I came to work, what else do they want?
Head straight up, the hall, to A-1
My secretary always has something to say but
This time what she said left me straight crushed
"You do know it's Saturday, right?"
Say what?

[Chorus: Mega Ran]
If ya don't move, then ya don't eat
So ya better get up on your feet
It's a new day, running outta time
So ya gotta grind, time to rise and shine

If ya don't move, then ya don't eat
So ya better get up on your feet
It's a new day, running outta time
So ya gotta grind, time to rise and shine
