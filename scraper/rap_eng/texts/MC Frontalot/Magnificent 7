Int80:
Another day at work
I'm just grinding on my gears

On some TGIF
The weekend's finaly here!

It means follow Friday
The choice is kinda hard

Let's start with megaran
And the Mega Man card

Shaffer the Darklord
Real YTCracker

And Beefyness of course
'cause they all my favorite rappers

STD:
@int80 what up are you updating
And doing the song

Writin' it on twitter
Thats crazy!

Beefy:
I'm outside combination
Pizza Hut and Taco Bell

They got my order wrong again
So all those kids can go to hell

Random:
@int80, sorry for interrupting
But it's public so i figured

It was up for discussion
I love you like a brother

So we be forever fam
But how you doin' twitter jam without MegaRan

Int80:
It's a simple plan!

Beefy:
You didn't forget your man!

Int80:
And megaran, remember when we hung out back at Scriblejam?

Random:
I remember, had the Cincinati Chili
But really if you want to

You should come down to Philly

Beefy:
Just saw this really sweet chick!
Body tend to stay fit!

Body tended basics
So check her out on tweetfit

STD:
All you rappers sitting
Hunchin' over your screens

I'm on an N train
Rockin' through astoria queens

Int80:
When we saw the dark Knight
Back in July

I took the very same line
I remember than ride

STD:
And I recall meeting
Earlier that month

Let's see
It was you and me and (Bozo?)

Wait
Where the hell is front?
