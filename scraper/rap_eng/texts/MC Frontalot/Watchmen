MEGA RAN: Uh.  Uh huh.  Who watch, who watch, who watch?

VERSE 1:

(MEGA RAN)
Yo, they passed the Keane Act without my feedback
Structure we lack, it's all bout green backs
Time to beat back the wolves, but keep back
Cause times are changing – it’s off the meat rack
I'm on lockdown, but Doc's on the case
Situation spotty like these dots on my face
Mask is back on, I tend to mine
’Cause if we don't step up, the end is nigh

(MC FRONTALOT)
Technically I'm Nite Owl II, don't mix me up with the first one
Right on cue, observe a crime and alert some
Figures of authority, cause I've gone quits on the "cape game"
Midsection's gone thick to my great shame!
And my gadgets are all dusty
But my conscience still nags pretty bad, you can trust me
To get fussy, also to get freaky
While we're flying up on high in Archimedes!

CHORUS:

Who watches the Watchmen?  (I don't know)
Who watches the Watchmen?  (Man, I don’t know)
Who watches the Watchmen?  (I don’t know)
But police in this town move way too slow

Who watches the Watchmen?  (I don't know)
Who watches the Watchmen?  (Man, I don’t know)
Who watches the Watchmen?  (I don't know)
But something's going on and the people want to know

VERE 2:

(MISS EAVES)
Hollywood wanna test me and make me 2D
Latex legacy my ex tastes of batteries
Ya!  Women are from Venus, I'm on mars
Learning the comedian is my father
So guess crime fighting is in my blood
My mom pushed me to this family business
Jailbreak queen, Rorshach out of sing sing
My existence makes Jon save everything

(MC LARS)
Blood running down my face like the button in the street
A problematic hero?  Many would would agree
Y’all ain't ready for Eddie, have you heard what I did?
I went to Vietnam and I murdered some kids (what!)
See I'm part Thomas Hobbes sometimes a comedian
I was tossed out the window, landed on the median
Vigilante justice, hunting hippies with a smile
We protect them from themselves and we do it with style

CHORUS:

Who watches the Watchmen?  (I don't know)
Who watches the Watchmen?  (Man, I don't know)
Who watches the Watchmen?  (I don't know)
But police in this town move way too slow

Who watches the Watchmen?  (I don't know)
Who watches the Watchmen?  (Man, I don't know)
Who watches the Watchmen?  (I don't know)
But something's going on and the people want to know

VERSE 3:

(SCHÄFFER THE DARKLORD)
It is 1945, father is a watchmaker
It is '59, molecular incinerator
Jon is gone, in three months I am there again
Doc's a god, they'll say the superman's American
I am in the past, future, I am on Mars
I am 99 syllables in eight bars
The world's smartest man, wealthy by birthright
Is no more of a threat to me than is its smartest termite

(QUELLE CHRIS)
The smartest man cold as winter
World turned me bitter
I been overstimulating before Facebook and Twitter
With a wall full of screens
Account full of green and
Built a hideout where it's white out
For the plotting and the scheming
Got a liger named Bubastis
I silenced and retired my peers
To cover the dark matter in my conscience
With time it won't get better
The dawn is turning redder
Show the world to its demise so it can get itself together

CHORUS:

Who watches the Watchmen?  (I don't know)
Who watches the Watchmen?  (Man, I don't know)
Who watches the Watchmen?  (I don't know)
But police in this town move way too slow

Who watches the Watchmen?  (I don't know)
Who watches the Watchmen?  (Man, I don't know)
Who watches the Watchmen?  (I don't know)
But something's going on and the people want to know

MEGA RAN: Who watches the Watchmen?
