Don’t know how to turn the box off

I don’t know how to turn it off. I don’t know if I want to
And I don’t know if I learned enough to be standing on a
Soap box, telling everyone how to live
Everybody’s got a critique that they’ve got to give
And mine is only as regards my own habitual
Dissemination of the celebration ritual
“Online is so great, let’s all go there!
We’ll be there together, even though it’s nowhere!”
And some scaredy-cats are going to log off
But I’ll tell them: muster bravery, be not soft
Be not often (nor ever) in absentia
And if you get in trouble while you’re logged on, do not mention the
Rapper who told you to never to touch the power switch
I eschew all weaknesses such as cowardice
(I’ll evince them often but I don’t admit)
If you’re streaming this record then you’re already it

Don’t know how to turn the box off
Don’t know how to turn, to turn, to turn

Wake up updating feeds and I’m bleeding followers
Though not for want of politesse. Who is egregious? All of us
Oh. Wander onto the avenue, screen at eye level
Camera in the high bezel. See me seeking my devil
See me stumble, I’ll mumble a couple of repetitions
Of the current obscurities. Hurry, this transmission is
Up! Beat those hearts and those thumbs into submission
‘Cause I’m aware of all internet traditions
Ha. Ha. I laugh in recognition, not joy
(an emotion I’ve outsourced my ability to deploy)
Think my unlimited toy is in need of a feeding
Venture back home to the bigger displays and plug in as needed
I figure I’ll stay seated for the rest of the day now
There’s no way to relax. It’ll say how on the forum. Okay, wow
There’s one technique, and nobody’s verified it:
Flick the power switches off. But that won’t work, I’ve tried it
