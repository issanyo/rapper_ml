{Hook X2]
Do it she do it, she do it, do it, do it
She do it she do it, she do it, do it, do it
Eh do it bitch, do it
Eh do it bitch, do it
She do it she do it, do it, do it
She do it she do it she do it, do it, do it
Do it bitch, do it
Ya do it bitch, do it

[Verse 1]
Do it bitch do it drop it put your back in to it
Shake your money maker and you know them dollars make you move it
Let me see your G-spot you can suck me up all night
Your friend wanna to watch she can jump it off a pink rod
Thick fine bad bitches duffel bag cash getting
Couple grams stashed in it man I’m like wheres penny
And look out how she pour with it
Sometimes she be gold digging
Man one of my hoes tripping you know I be slow slipping
She do it look how she got that body right
She called me out to come through I come over she get me right
Baby do the shit bend over right there and sit
She told me she wanted that in her mouth but that way to big

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Look how she do that shit from the back and on top again
She know I’m watching that Halle Berry banana split
So ghetto super thick tattoos on her neck and her wrist
She leaving with me and not the niggas she came with
She back it back legged back at a ballers from the back
I asked her where she work, she said the mall poppin tags
I said poppin tags? She said poppin tags
I should’ve known when I’ve seen her with them shopping bags
Chanel, Versace, Gucci, Prada knock off nada
Mommy spend a lot of dollars yes, euros 0s, comma es plural do it girl

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Look at she touch her toes bend over and drop it to the floor
She like to do it, her momma can do it better though
Say she 21 she ain’t tripping she want to have some fun
Now she getting wild on the act and I’m trying to get me some
Take a shot get with it, how do it, don’t never let it stop
Know you like Ciroc but I’m sipping some Henny on the rocks
What you want to show and tell baby I want to see
Do it for my niggas at least if you don’t do it for me

[Hook]
