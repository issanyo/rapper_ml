[Intro: Sample from "I Call Your Name" by Switch]
I used to think about immature things
Y'know, like, "Do you love me? Do you want me
Are you gon' call me like you said you would?
Is this really your real phone number?"

[Lil Jon]
Wait a minute motherfuckers

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Ain't a hood nigga but a nigga from the ho-od
See Momma stayed on me so I turned out pretty go-od
But if you wanna try, sucker now then we can do it
Ha-ha sleep, Tylenol PM if I pull it
Sh-sh-sheep, count 'em for the rest of ya life
Yeah, yeah your partner got away but now he vegetable-like
So, so I sent his mom and dad a whole case of V8
He can die, any second, how much long it's 'gon take
Gon' get it over with; oh, what if you were in my loafers then?
You might be the dope but I would flush it down the toilet
Like the boys in blue, when they come through with them boots
And they kickin down the do', and they don't care who they shoot
But we do care who they shoot, so we do what we must do
So we act like we run track, then we run straight to the back
But they comin from the back, so we run back to the front
They say get down on ya knees we say what the fuck you want
They want cheese, they want bread, they want dough, they want mo'
Than I wanna give 'em but if I keep talkin' they won't know
That my cousin in the back, and we call him Roto-Rooter
Slash plumber, cash runner, and he fire on them computers, log out

[Refrain: Rich Boy]
Fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight, no slack, just bought a Cadillac
Throw some D's on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac
Throw some D's on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac
Rich Boy sellin crack, fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight, no slack, just bought a Cadillac
Throw some D's on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac
Throw some D's on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Shout outs to Rich Boy, Mobile Alabama, let's get it
Shout outs to Rich Boy, we all wanna be rich, boy
Alabama bricks boy tryin' to get them big toys
Two-twelve motorin' tell Harry, throw some D's on that bitch
Now I'm gettin' fly couple G's on the fit
I'm at the jeweler now, throw some freeze on the bitch
I got a chest cold and I might sneeze on the bitch
We at the strip club we throw some G's on that bitch cause we ballin'
We all OutKasts, hot cars, we coppin' cash
Chop shop, the added stash, cop cars can kiss my ass
The car wash my whips, glowin' no tints we fish bowlin'
No top with the piff blowin', throw some D's on that bitch
And we go hard, Zone 4, D-Boy squad
We don't need the bar, coast with lawyers baby just to beat the charge
We got a fetish coppin' speedy cars, charge it to my Visa card
They never thought that we'd get large

[Murphy Lee]
Lunatics sittin' fat, St. Louis on the map
Sixty-nine wet black, I just got my Cutty back
Throw some D's on that ho, I just got my Cutty back
Throw, throw some D's on that ho, I just got my Cutty back

[Nelly]
How could I slip, how could I fall
When you're baby mama got my poster high up on her wall
And that ain't all she done gave me them drawers

[Murphy Lee]
I'm Murphy Lee please tell yo' sexy little sister I called
Last time she asked me for some money I was sent to the North
But now I'm rich and she can get it see these D's match my fitted

[Nelly]
My paint is banana splitted inside is totally ig'nant
Outside is totally kitted, to be specific it's wicked how them Derrty Boyz did it

[Murphy Lee]
That Buick Regal, I lit it
My Monte Carlo's terrific
That El Dorado (Got switches) Tamika and them, I done hit it
That twenty mill, I done spent it, that house on the hill, I live it
And that diamond herringbone you know them niggas did it
Walk up in the strip club, lookin for a big butt
Shawty wanna get fucked, I brought about ten what
Throw throw some ones on 'em Mo, I brought about ten what
Throw throw some ones on 'em Mo, I brought about ten what

[Refrain: Rich Boy]

[Verse 4: Rich Boy]
It's Rich Boy yeah baby I'm a baller
I dropped a hit and had to go park my Impala
I threw some D's on that Lac and now it's taller
They see the wheels on my De Ville so they holla
Let's get this dollar, I got the fat man 'Lac
Took it to the paint shop and got the fat man black
I hold my jacket with my Tokyo Adidas on
Ho don't even call my phone if you ain't gonna get me on
So fuck you haters, I'll see you later
Might see the gator, in my Escalator
Mama told me put some D's on it son you ridin' wrong
So I took them 20's off and put the monster wheels on

[Refrain: Rich Boy]

[Verse 5: The Game]
All red Chevrolet, 26's ridin' high
Dukes of Hazard doors, in Compton we call 'em suicides
Suede roof, leather seats, woodgrain steering wheel
Candy apple hardtop, Game logo on the grill
California license plate ridin' through the A-T-L
Keep my tires bald I never leave a paper trail
Nah I'm a keep it clean, ball when I hit the scene
Elbow out the window, show 'em how to gangsta lean
Put Cali on the map, Westside on my back
Hometown on my face, forty-five on my lap
Twenty in my earlobe, hundred on my neck piece
Just bought a Bentley nigga and I'm a (throw some D's on that bitch)
Pull up at the rim shop and (throw some D's on that bitch)
Might as well cut the top
Let the sunshine in and the bass jump out
Hit the block 15's vibratin' the whole fuckin' house
