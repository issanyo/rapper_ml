I'm trying to save us girl.....
They got that...
They got that kryptonite...

[Verse 1: Mario]
It seems the more I try to do right
The more I lie about being at sessions and leaving at certain times
She's like, "Where you at?"
I'm at the studio at home
And I'm thinking to myself we cut that record days ago
Cause shorty on the east side, hit me and want to know if I could stop by
Now I'm contemplating what I am gonna say, bout this being the umpteenth time that Im late

[Hook: Mario]
I wanna be your superman
I'm trying to save our love the best way that I can
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
These girls got kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
And I really wanna make it work, but I can't stop messing round
I'm here doing dirt
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
These girls got kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
Oh baby

[Verse 2: Mario]
It's like the more I brush them off, the more they call
The more I want to tell them that I'm not in love
With anyone, when I know it's you
Wanna tell the truth but it's just so hard to do
Caught up in me again it's driving me crazy
It's the reason I won't tell em I got a lady
Now I'm trying to contemplate on what I am gonna say, on this being the umpteenth time that Im late

[Bridge: Mario]
No matter what I do, I know that your my true love
But I just can't help it to get caught up with all these broads
Sitting here with this mic in my hand
Trying to record the words to make my baby understand

[Hook: Mario]
I wanna be your superman
I'm trying to save our love the best way that I can
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
These girls got kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite

And I really wanna make it work, but I can't stop messing round
I'm here doing dirt
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
These girls got kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
Oh baby

[Verse 3: Mario]
I want you to be my lois lane
Girl I promise I'm gonna change, and it ain't gonna be this way forever
Girl I'm gonna get myself together, cause your the one I love
Because your like a drug that I can't get enough of
I'm just so confused, dont know what to do
Cause the way that it's feeling, I like how it's feeling
It's getting so hard, to fight that feeling

[[Verse 4: Rich Boy Rap]
I'm a rich boy riding wit my bitch, superstar shit
The one girls try to get they text me on my sidekick
Bring em to my palace, tell em take it off we make a flick
Every night I do it so at least one chick I gotta get
Just like kryptonite them girls make me super weak
Suck my dick and play with me until they put me straight to sleep
Twenty girls on my sheets, seven days out the week
It's hard trying to hold it down with groupies trying to get with me
I stay dreaming, fantasizing, with my eyes closed
I love you girl but I'm addicted to them hoes
If ballin is a sin then God please forgive me
My women so bad and my money so filthy really

[Hook: Mario]
I wanna be your superman
I'm trying to save our love the best way that I can
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
These girls got kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
And I really wanna make it work, but I can't stop messing round
I'm here doing dirt
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
These girls got kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite

I wanna be your superman
I'm trying to save our love the best way that I can
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
These girls got kryptonite
These girls got kryptonite
And I really wanna make it work
