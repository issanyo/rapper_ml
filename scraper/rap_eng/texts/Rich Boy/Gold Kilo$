Now if her attitude switch I gotta roll out with another bitch
Send her back a pick while her best friend suckin' it
Hoes start takin' off their clothes when the budget hit
Any time you chasin' more paper the haters comes with it
Primetime dimes wanna call me and face dial
Ride so big I need a license like I truck drive
Niggas talk about it but I play a whole different game
Females fantasize about stuntin' in my Chevy thang
Piles of that money in my pocket but you pussy
Haters mention my name 'cause they can't overlook me
Some like to swallow it, some like it in they face
Pardon me, girls pop they pussy back up at my place
I'm chasin' mill but there's too many bitches callin' my cell
Gold kilos so heavy that they broke the scale
All glass speaker box, blew somethin' with the locks
Say you makin' knots, show me mothafucka, pull 'em out

Seconds, minutes, hours go to the all mighty dollar
All, all mighty dollar, all, all mighty dollar
Hopin' them crackers see me, hopin' them crackers see me
Hopin' them crackers see me, hopin' them crackers see me
