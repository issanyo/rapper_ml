Girl, do whatever you like it's your bar
Oh girl, tonight it's on me
Baby tell me what you want

[Rap - Rich Boy]
Me in the zone, gon' on patron
In a club, in a club, playin her song
That's when I slowly approach
She like daddy what you know
Told the girl (on my drink)
Then she drop it down low

To the floor, to the floor
She took it to the floor
(repeat 3x)

[Drake]
Ok, Ok, Sittin' in a owners box
And in the Caribbean twistin' off Corona tops
I'm sittin' down hittin' half court floater shot
Bitches takin' pictures because every night's a photo op
Yeah, and nothing has been photo shopped
I say I'mma buy the bar and they say nigga no you're not
I be satisfied with the percentage that my lawyer got
Makin' other people rich is something I enjoy alot
Uh, can you tell even when your girl won't
I'mma still be feelin' me even when the world don't
Shit just changed forever first I get a lot of dough
Then I end up with your woman that's just how it's gotta go
Yeah, and I can tell her things and treat her right
You can get whatever baby remember you and me tonight
Throw the pussy at me guarantee that you won't see a strike
I'mma hit it hard you gon' think you Derek Jeter wife
Uh, tell me, how does that sound?
I can get it ass up and with your back down
Spit that all suki suki in your ear
It's the nigga Rich Boy and the rookie of the year
