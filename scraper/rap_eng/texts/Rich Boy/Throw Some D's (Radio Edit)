Zone 4
Get money
New money
It's what you been waiting on

[Hook:]
Rich Boy sellin' that
All they might us wanna jack
S**t tight no slack
Just bought a Cadillac (Throw some D's on that!)
Just bought a Cadillac (Throw some D's on that!)
Just bought a Cadillac

[Verse 1: Rich Boy]
Rich Boy sellin' that all they might us wanna jack
Shit tight no slack just bought a Cadillac
Took it to the chop shop
Got the damn top dropped two colored flip flopped
Candy red lollipop
There's h**s in the parking lot
But I still got my Glock cocked
New money motherf**ker don't you see the big knot
Don't you see the big chain
Don't you see the big rims
Wonder who they hatin' on lately
Baby it's him candy paint
Gator skin seats call me Dundee
Pope in your hood I'm the one that you wanna be
Haters wish they could feel the wood in my '83
Ridin' with no tint so the motherf**kers know it's me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Polow Da Don]
I never slip, I never fall
A lot of h**s give me they numbers but I never call
A real O.G. -- look at V.I.P. and see a playa ball
Then after we hit the club baby then I'm gonna hit them draws
I'm gonna break you off (and that's all)
Every freak should have a picture of my d**k (on they wall)
Polow be the s**t, zone 4 be the click
Yeah this for my dawgs
Yeah gangsters, hustlers, wanksters, busters
(Wait a minute motherf**ker)

[Hook]


Hit the block on some new 10 thousand dollar wheels
Can't explain how I feel
Touchin' gator on my wheel
Got peanut butter ice cream
Peter Pan seats just got a fresh cut
Now we looking for them freaks
Take a bad yella b***h
Make her drop them draws
I'mma show you how to ball
Middle finger to the law so f**k them
N***as what they wanna do?
Hating on a player cause my 'lac skated 22's
When I pull up I'mma park right at the front door lean
In my cup got purp in my blunt
I'mma real pimp b***h I ain't playin' like a trick
Just bought a new 'Lac bout to put them
Thangs on that b***h!
