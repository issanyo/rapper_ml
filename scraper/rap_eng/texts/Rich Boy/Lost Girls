It was a girl named Shanda
Drove a Honda
Stayed talking back and get smart with her mama
The real grown type
She was always right
Couldn?t get along with Pops cause they stayed in a fight
If it ain?t skipping school going out with grown men
Better your man named Sam with a white Benz
He used to take her out and buy Shanda the world
And even told Shanda
You my only girl
One night it was late, they kissing and hugging
Next thing you know they kissing and loving
Two days go by and Sam ain?t showed up
Now Shanda on the bathroom floor sick throwing up
Mamma found out and had Sam arrested
Now Shanda at the doctor?s cause she wanna get tested
When the results came back it was positive
That?s the thing about life; you learn and you live
Get up stand up for your life
I said young girl
Get up stand up for your life
Get up stand up for your life
Even darkness comes to light
I said young girl

Even darkness comes to light young girl
Get up yourself
Get a man who ?..
Even though sometimes you may be lost girl
Don?t worry about..this is your world, your world
Get a man who ?
Even though sometimes you may be lost girl
Don?t worry about..this is your world, your world
It was a girl named Courtney
She was fine as hell
She was looking for a man with a lotta mail
She had big dreams about the real good life
And everything she wanted had a real high price
Like Dolce Gabbana, Gucci and Prada
So if you ain?t spend big Courtney ain?t holler
She all about the dollar, but let?s go way back
When Courtney was going with this hard working cat
A drug dealer came along and ?
Next thing you know she was taking it right
We part of the reason why she at where she at
Now her ex-man got a million dollar car jack
His pockets are fed but Courtney is still broke
Cause her old man got caught with a lil dope
She stuck with two kids and no child support
I did it for girls taking life for a joke
Get up stand up for your life
I said young girl
Get up stand up for your life
Get up stand up for your life
Even darkness comes to light
I said young girl
Even darkness comes to light young girl
I said Get up stand up for your life young girl
Get up stand up for your life
I said young girl
Get up stand up for your life
Get up stand up for your life young girl
Even darkness comes to light
He said Even darkness comes to light
Young girl
Young girl
Young girl
Get up yourself
