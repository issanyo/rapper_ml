[Verse 1]
I fly like paper, get high like planes
If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one done in a second if you wait
I fly like paper, get high like planes
If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one done in a second if you wait

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner we're making our fame
Bonafide hustler making my name
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner we're making our fame
Bonafide hustler making my name

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Man I'm rollin' through the city, old school on them big boys
12 inch woofers in the trunk making big noise
Got the big toys (toys), dont make me have to flash
Let a hundred rounds go, you do a hundred yard dash
Back up in the hood where the rules dont shift
And the gangstas talk trills, sip purp and burn piff
You can call 5-0 and 5-0 might come
But by the time that they arrive all that dirt had been done
Now one things for certain, and two things for sure
Being poor is a disease, gotta hustle up a cure
Start with your head homie then use your hands
If you try it in reverse, you dont even have a chance
We worldwide worried with the hunger and the thirst
From the third world countries to the second and the first
It sounds like a verse but its more like a plan
Get your Robin Hood on, put some pressure on the man, tell it!

[Verse 4: Rich Boy]
I wake up in the morning with my bitch in the bed
She don't like the police and she sure hate the feds
I love my girl cause she gives me what I want
She ride in the trunk or either ride in the front
She looks like 22 but she really 45
Some reason she done made a whole lotta niggas cry
So bad that she make â€˜em all pull they money out
Take it out they pockets and they put it in my pouch
Ouch! gotta hurt the way that girl do ya
She always wanna what take, take, take the moolah
Gimmie them pesos the cash and the credit card
Might be a broad but the lil' bitch hit ya hard
You the police and we is the robbers
You need more than them helicopters to stop us
Excuse me, let me introduce my lady
Her name is Beretta and she mothafuckin crazy!
