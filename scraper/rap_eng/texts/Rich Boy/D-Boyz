[Rich Boy:] Ay Fresh, tell em what we 'bout to get, boy

[Bridge: Mannie Fresh]
Money, cars, clothes, hoes
Motherfuckin diamonds on my motherfuckin toes
Shoot it in your bank, trick sniff it up your nose

[Verse 1: Rich Boy]
To my niggas in the hood with a mouth full of rocks
The boy on the block still runnin from the cops *police sirens*
Dope in they socks watchin for the police
Tattoos with the jewels and the gold teeth
Everyday he in the kitchen with the cake mix
Cuz the projects taught him how to make bricks
Yeah, he let it cook till it rock up
Even though he know he might get locked up *jail slam*
In the cell cuz somebody might tell
It's niggas doing time for illegal drug sales
With no fare callin home from the prison phone
And you the nigga they ain't even find the dope on
We getting fucked by the damn government
Cuz they the ones moving all the hard white shit (white shit)
For the boy trying to get up out the dope game
Hurry up cuz they comin through the door man

[Verse 2: Rich Boy]
Fresh white tee with the fresh white sneaks
Rollin thru the hood in a old school fleek
Nigga in the hood everybody wanna be
The boy with the tee, why they hatin off me?
We slangin' hard cuz we couldn't get a job
I dropped outta school but I am still street smart
Around here we ain't playin' with the boy scouts
Cuz niggas rob in the drought when the dope out
By the crack house waiting for the next fiend
Tryna make cream, livin off of hood dreams
From the dope, the powder, and the cocaine
The dope man, the nigga wit the street fame
Shooted up the thang, toot it out your nose
It's all about the money, cars, clothes, hoes
The reason why niggas gotta get up and get it
Dope man Nikes with the shirt and the fitted (get it)

[Bridge: Mannie Fresh]
Money, cars, clothes, hoes

Crackagator shoes with the big bank roll
I'm the reason why niggas gotta get up and get it
Dope man Nikes with the shirt and the fitted

[Verse 3: Rich Boy]
I did it for my boys on street tryna eat (tryna eat)
Them boys in this game tryna make it every week (every week)
Street team makin' money with the team (wit the team)
Serve it to the dope fiends off the triple beam
Stay up on your grind get your money and then shine
It's a lot of drug dealers doing hard time
I dedicate it to my boys in the state penn
And to my niggas that would never see the streets again
