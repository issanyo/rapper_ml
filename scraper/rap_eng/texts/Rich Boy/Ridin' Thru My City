[Verse 1: Rich Boy]
This ain’t nothing, I ain’t stunting till I hit the button
Wrist out the window, blue river diamonds flooding
Riding by the ocean just for promotion
Top back, white laundry, let doors open
Groupies looking froze, should've left the freezer closed
Her breast and thighs hotter than some wings at Burger Joe’s
Now take a pose, got the Lambo with the cameras flashing
Yellow bird, flying spur with the doors flapping

[Pre-Chorus: Rich Boy]
Convertible status, twenty carats, no fucking salad
I’m coming back from Cali with white bricks up on the pallet
I’m in my city drop topping, and got my trunk knocking
I made a profit from nothing, now bitches pussy-popping

[Chorus: Rich Boy]
I’m riding in my city with the top down
While I’m yelling out the window, this is my town
808 bumping down the block, I let it knock down
I got your girl riding with me cause I’m hot now
You see me riding in my city, I’m riding in my city
I’m riding in my city, I’m riding in my city
I’m riding in my city with the top down
And I got your girl riding with me with her top down
First I tell her take off your shirt, then take off your bra
Then take off your skirt, now take off your thong
I’m a dog and she know it, money I’ll blow it
My doors lift open, now can you see me rolling?

[Verse 2: The Game]
I’m something like an animal, gorilla slash cannibal
Riding with the cannon, I’ll put something in your cantaloupe
And this shit classic, yeah, something like a can of Coke
Polo came and got me cause he knew I was the antidote
If you thought Eminem was dope, meet the man from Interscope
That opened up his Phantom door, pull out a chopper and a scope
Bullets like the [?], red bandana tote
More P’s than Mississippi, even David Banner know
I got an Alabama ho, cock back the hammer slow
She just left Compton, now she sliding down Atlanta poles
Met a chick from the Lou’, that’s my country grammar ho
Sing like Nelly and she blow like Barry Manilow
Riding through my city wearing more red than Santa Claus
My life a movie, I am legend, red drop and a dog
Trunk vibrating like a playstation analog
Flying through Compton like Serena William’s tennis balls

[Chorus: Rich Boy]
I’m riding in my city with the top down
While I’m yelling out the window, this is my town
808 bumping down the block, I let it knock down
I got your girl riding with me cause I’m hot now
You see me riding in my city, I’m riding in my city
I’m riding in my city, I’m riding in my city
I’m riding in my city with the top down
And I got your girl riding with me with her top down
First I tell her take off your shirt, then take off your bra
Then take off your skirt, now take off your thong
I’m a dog and she know it, money I’ll blow it
My doors lift open, now can you see me rolling?

[Verse 3: Rich Boy]
I’m in my transportation, roller skating
Swanging and navigating
Twenty foot ceilings in my crib, with linen draping
Two bitches in my bed, get the camera cause we taping
Too many women, I don’t fucking see this money I’m making
Baking soda by the bacon, I’m cooking, mix and whip it
Paint job like syrup dripping, call Willie, rim flipping
I'm pimping, I ain’t tripping bout you bitch, run your mouth
Cause you gon see me with your friend and my top off

[Pre-Chorus: Rich Boy]
Convertible status, twenty carats, no fucking salad
I’m coming back from Cali with white bricks up on the pallet
I’m in my city drop topping, and got my trunk knocking
I made a profit from nothing, now bitches pussy-popping

[Chorus: Rich Boy]
I’m riding in my city with the top down
While I’m yelling out the window, this is my town
808 bumping down the block, I let it knock down
I got your girl riding with me cause I’m hot now
You see me riding in my city, I’m riding in my city
I’m riding in my city, I’m riding in my city
I’m riding in my city with the top down
And I got your girl riding with me with her top down
First I tell her take off your shirt, then take off your bra
Then take off your skirt, now take off your thong
I’m a dog and she know it, money I’ll blow it
My doors lift open, now can you see me rolling?
