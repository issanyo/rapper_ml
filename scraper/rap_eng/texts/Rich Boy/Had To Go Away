[Verse: Rich Boy]
Lights hit my ice and make the whole chain illuminate
I'm a boss, [?] [?] [?]
Talk the top dollar, stack bread like a wedding cake
Everybody telling me drop, don't make the world wait
Even haters be fans cause they watching
All on the internet, checking for when I'm dropping
Female freaks fall through like a [?]
Feels like a job, balling hard, getting no [wrist?]
Chasing more chicks, you chase a piece of pussy
No need to call, if you ain't got enough to book me
Coming out the crib with a couple hundred karats on
[And/on?] my cellular phone getting calls from Hong Kong
And I'm packing it, aiming accurate
[Hate?] ain't having it, cash got me stacking it
And the girls ask, can they best friend, come on sis'
Who the special guest list, rich boy[?], Young Gliss

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Young Gliss]
Putting on for my city, in different places, they see my face
And embrace it like I'm one of they own
And it's crazy this love's never from home
But as soon as I blow, my bandwagon is what they'll be on
And it's funny cause some will tell you they been on
When I was trying to show them, I'm nothing for them to sleep on
But breach on, I know I surely find a way
To the promise land even though it seems so far away
Cause stupids really in now
Cause everybody follows suit, they just wanna be the in crowd
And since everything is a trend now
Tattoos, and skinny jeans what's in now
And that ain't ever been my style
[I'll be?] real on my life, I ain't trying to fuck a male
That's why I'm on the next flight, heading out of town
And I ain't looking back nigga, got my heads to the clouds
And I'm gone

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Chris Young]
Got a couple gangstas in the county, can't wait until the bus comes
Ya'll ain't cut from the same cloth we cut from
Who gave her that ring, we fucked them and ducked them
Cap to save a show, slash cop wanna cuff 'em
Guns corrupt them, can't roll without my soldier
And that be the stock over my shoulder
[Dirtywings?] and [Hawkings?], cops pulling us over
Larry Davis, [?] you haters pulling the toaster
It's Young Chris, Gliss, Dice Raw
[TTLO], they trying to turn the lights off
Division one, told 'em we get it done
[Hold ransom?] at a hundred from soldiers [?] [son?] (kill him)
Back to getting blunted, [Pan-Ameri?] fuck up the hundred
It's young Tony, for you niggas, who want it
[?] over these clowns, did it, we done it
And if the music stop, my street niggas will front it

[Hook:]

[Verse 4: Dice Raw]
Dice is here, it's about to get critical
I can get lyrical, I can get physical whatever
Cali, playing eighty degree weather
Fuck it, I love when a plan comes together
I talk to the angels, and fulfill my prophecy
You talk to the cops, the reason why they watching me
But they never catch me, and I'm totally legit
And I never quit, rednecks hate that kind of shit
So pop the top and off we go still
This dude is so ill, these dudes got no skills
Flavor of the month, I lay back lighting niggas up like a blunts
Kick them in the head like punts
Roundhouse, and roughhouse and keep it one hundred
Nigga, I keep it one-hundred thousand
Who the illest, you dead if you can't feel this
So quit the bullshit, what'chu talking 'bout Willis

[Hook:]
