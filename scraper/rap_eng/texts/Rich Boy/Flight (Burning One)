(Verse: Rich Boy)
I’m on the over-night, long flight
I’m bout that jet life
Hella ice, [?] bright, beamin' like some headlights
Hit the switch and watch that bitch go front, back, left, right
Hydraulic, hopping dropping scraping up the tailpipe
[?], [?] with the racing track
Engine muscle car, transmission taking out the competition
Old school, antique, hear me beat from up the street
Two women at the same time tryna suck on me
Drivin' fast, looking at digital custom dash, paint
Job drippin’ wet looking like a piece of glass
Everything I envision, exactly how I'm livin'
Out the country, shit
Champagne pissin’
Bad bitches I be with, I fucked them hoes you couldn’t hit
Make em come and suck some dick, pop that pussy, do a split
Penthouse suit, from the bed you can see the beach
Chillin’ at the jet lounge, burnin’ one with Curren$y

(Verse 2: Curren$y)
Uh, batteries in my trunk
My car swayin’ in em lanes but the driver not drunk
He a rider momma, jump in that Impala
Let that color bar dazzle ya, capture the baddest passengers
Tryna sneak selfies of themselves in the Chevy
With the Captain Andretti on the wheels
And he will stay ready to hit the switch concrete
Meet the metal, four tails sparks like my lighter do
And I been doin’ this since bicycles I had the Stingray
Schwinn with the 8 ball caps on my valve stems
That’s him, back when niggas thought I wouldn’t do it
And I had to show em, I move em with hydraulic fluid
And I really own em, I ain’t lyin’ in my music, just relying on my crew to keep an eye out for looters
Keep an eye out for shooters
Keep an eye out for losers
