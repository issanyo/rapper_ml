Yeah, yeah, hey, hey hey

[Verse 1]
R.I.P. Pooh Bear, that's my dead homie
Fuck that other shit, hey, let's get this bread homie
Remember when they could catch a charge down in Atlanta
They underestimate me cause I'm comin' from Alabama
Martin Lee Anderson he ain't even have a chance
They beat him in that boot camp 'til he died in that ambulance
That boy was only fifteen years old, fuck what they say he did
So tell me how I'm 'posed to feel when police killin' kids?
And then we can't get a job, ridin' we get them pounds
If it ain't that coke then we get that 'dro and break it down
See that ice, the dope man paradise
Boy better think twice, that dope have you doin' life
They tore down the projects, so where we gon' move next?
They takin' them food stamps, they stop government checks
Hey, money my motivator, my mouth my money maker
Naw I don't see them haters, so let's go get this paper

[Bridge 1]
Yeah when you look at us just think about it, we don't own nothin'
If we get money, we got a lil' few dollars, but our whole family tore up nigga
You gettin' money for the people in ya family that ain't got nothin'
When it's all said and done, what do you own? You don't own nothin', you
Don't own you... The nigga playin' basketball, he don't own that jersey, he can't
Even be in a commercial wit' his name on the back, so when it's really all
Said and done, what did you do this for? What difference did you make?

[Verse 2]
You see how the world changin'? Yeah, they left Saddam hangin'
Wish they just kill 'em all so now the Middle East they bangin'
Preachers in that pulpit, say they teach that bullshit
So know how we know it's bullshit? Same niggas I went to school wit'
Grabbin' on yo' nuts and disrespectin' get you merked
Them young niggas got pistol grips, they been about they killin' shit
But they all some hypocrites, haters they won't let me be
When I come up to them gates, I hope you say you heard of me
Now Kendrick Curtis gone, them angels took him home
They gave my brother ten years, the system did him wrong
Now we convicted felons, because they caught us sellin'
And nine times out of ten yo' friend the one who tellin'
I wanna go to Heaven, up to that Promised Land
I need another chance, I wanna meet that man
Money my motivator, my mouth my money maker
No I don't see you haters, so let's go get this paper

[Bridge 2 - Polow Da Don]

Everyday for some bullshit! Huh nigga? What yo' bank account say nigga?
Oh that's all? Haha!

[Verse 3]
They shippin' them boys off, they fightin' in Iraq
It's soldiers in that war that ain't never gon' make it back
Niggas this the battlefield, fake niggas scream keep it real
Yeah yeah, rob, steal, anything to pay them bills
Hey nigga times harder, so we grind harder
We takin' chances wit' that coke comin' 'cross that water
Tryin' to get up out this ghetto life ain't gotta be this way
Them pigs they came and kicked my mama do' in yesterday
I prayed a thousand nights, I did a hundred crimes
And now I'm beggin' Lord that you don't let me down this time
Money my motivator, my mouth my money maker
No I don't see them haters, so let's go get this paper

[Bridge 3 - Rich Boy]
