[Verse 1: Rich Boy]
I'm blowin' smoke, pourin' drank
I live that life, fuck what you think
Finger print identification make the motor crank
Gettin' high behind the tint, stackin' up dead presidents
One million cash what I spent, now pay me like you pay your rent
Benjamin Franklin, head back to the bank again
Every night we get it in and every day we hustlin'
Mob ties, 'bout that action, in the club, my niggas actin', ayy
She make it happen, twerkin' with that booty clappin'
Poppin', droppin', hoppin' on the pole, she like to let it show
Bustin' bottles, openin' champagne, now watch the bubbles flow
Get that guap, make that dough, fake niggas gon' get exposed
Wrist cold, necklace froze, king shit, diamonds gold

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
Chevy took 'em out the parkin' lot, the bitch sexy
Money got your bitch sittin' on my lap, the bitch sexy
Plenty racks up in my timepiece, my wrist sexy
Chevy took 'em out the parkin' lot, the bitch sexy
Money got your bitch sittin' on my lap, the bitch sexy
Plenty racks up in my timepiece, my wrist sexy
She do it sexy

[Verse 2: Rich Boy]
Lock the block, cop a drop, blow up, leave an aftershock
Look at the canary watch, fifty thousand worth of rocks
They want to kill me like I'm Pac, I'm the one they want to stop
Try me with that dumb shit, I'm shootin' shots right on the spot
Fuck your bitch and mail you back a tape with your wife suckin' cock
Heard that I was gettin' guap, see these niggas tryna plot
I'm staking out, pussy niggas foldin' under pressure
And I'm totin' Glocks, never know when haters wanna test you
Talkin' like you ballin' but you never even took a flight
I was out the country in three cities, you ain't live this life
Get your cake, come out of state, twist them bodies, play it safe
She told you that she love you but that ho be lyin' to your face

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
Chevy took 'em out the parkin' lot, the bitch sexy
Money got your bitch sittin' on my lap, the bitch sexy
Plenty racks up in my timepiece, my wrist sexy
Chevy took 'em out the parkin' lot, the bitch sexy
Money got your bitch sittin' on my lap, the bitch sexy
Plenty racks up in my timepiece, my wrist sexy
She do it sexy

[Outro: Yung Bleu]
It's your boy Yung Bleu
You already know what it is
Lights camera action nigga, we takin' over man
Mobile stand up, Alabama stand up nigga
Yeah, the bitch sexy
Woo, the bitch sexy
Haha, they ain't even know we was comin' like that, did they
