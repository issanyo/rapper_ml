You niggas gon' learn buck a buckin'
D-boy squad buck a buckin' Rich Boy

I'm in that phantom, askin' for that gray poupon
Look at my arm bitch, ya see the charm bitch
Sweet home Alabama, Yeah, I love her
I still try to hug her even though she ain't my color

Yeah, I'm fucking wit that home boy but ain't nothin' left
See, I got enough heart to march with Martin Luther King
Got them killers right by me and we can have a party
If ya niggas wanna try me, surprise

We got some fireworks for ya
Pop the trunk ,get the gift inside lemme show ya
Niggas treat that coke like a joke
A cocaine city's like a murder up in Copeland
Pick ya brain like a buncha snow flakes
Yeah, I put that weight down, now it's real estate

Tell me watcha know 'bout me boy
That's me, I'ma mothafuckin' d-boy
Tell me watcha know 'bout me boy
That's me, I'ma mothafuckin' d-boy
Yeah, so go d-boy, yeah, so go d-boy
Yeah, so go d-boy, yeah, so go d-boy

If it ain't the truth me and my nigga don't write it
9 years from the day my uncle man got indicted
I thank God for the hard times when I suffer
He protect me like a Mother, nigga now, I'm tuffer

Can't forget about you prof, I still see ya
I'm at the graveyard everyday, I can't leave ya
I feel your soul when I'm writing with the pen
Fuck what them niggas say you my brother till the end

Nigga save a spot for me, tell God I'm coming
Niggas killin' fo' that money but they're leavin' here with nothing
If it a game motherfucker, I'ma win it
As far as I'm concerned, ain't no competition in it

Call me the gritty green 'cause I'm wanna lie
Now my mommy better thank what she got
Get some shit, just got a new house
Congratulations 'cause ya son made a million with his mouth
