[Hook: Ty$ and YG]

She bad and she knows it
She got her Gucci bag she got her Gucci pumps
No I ain't the first one that told her
And she a bad bitch so you know I have to tell her what's up
She bad she knows it
She got her Gucci bag she got her Gucci pumps
Girl, I just wanna know where you going
(And she a bad bitch so you know I have to tell her what's up)
After the club oohoohoohoh
After the club a-a-after the club oohoohoohoh

[Verse 1: YG]

Look she know I toot it and boot it
But tonight I ain't even tryna do that
Like the bottom of my 501's, I'm tryna cuff
She bad and she know it, the type that you wife up
Fuck her in the hotel room with the lights on
IPod on shuffle, playing a bunch of nice songs
She know I play no games
She said she like fame but she don't date no lames
And she want me to fuck her like I fuck a whore
So I pull her hair like we playing tug-o'-war
And I ain't tryna to sound rude when I say this
She probably look better if I see you butt naked

[Verse 1: Rich Boy]

My blackberry full of black barbies
With curves on their body like Bugattis
Sake with the sushi can't forget the music
Now show me how you do it, and get into it
She bad and she know it, champagne pouring
Your nigga just a rodent, he's tenderroni(?)
Summertime breeze, short cut sleeves
She hate it when I leave and get the green
On the weekend, I'mma creep in
Dive in how she like on the deep end
Merry-go-round, ass with the brown
Everybody see she is the baddest girl in the crowd

[Bridge: YG]

All my bad bitches in pumps
I wanna tell alla y'all what's up
You ain't been looking at me but I been looking at you
So tell me what it's gon be baby what we gon do tonight(tonight)
Baby what we gon' do tonight(tonight)
Baby what we gon' do

[Hook]
