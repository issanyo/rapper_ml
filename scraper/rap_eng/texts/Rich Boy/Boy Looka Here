[Hook]
Fuck talkin' get took boy looka here

Boy looka here, boy looka here
Looka here, looka here

[Verse 1]
Off top I'mma tell ya this some playa shit
A real nigga here now, better get ya bitch
Yeah, cause big pimpin' in the house now
If ya real then you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Rich Boy, I don't know what these niggas thankin'
Bet a thousand shoot a thousand what you niggas bankin'?
Comin' down like snow in the winter time
I don't know about you but I'm gettin' mine
D-I-P never, cold nigga, hell yeah
Zone 4, gon' pull up in the ATL
Gettin' money already know what it is
Huh, don't stop bitch what the business is
Get mo' ass then a lazy boy sofa
Keep my toaster, warm in my holster
See you got ya lil' jewelry but I'm chunked out
All the hatin' playboy, get ya stomped out

[Hook 2]
Fuck talkin' get took boy looka here
Rich Boy really do it boy looka here
We can buy the bar all night looka here
I can show you what a stack like looka here

[Verse 2]
Naw I don't wear tight shirts wit' the cuff links
See them big VS stones make ya eyes blink
Say I talk slow, and I rhyme funny
But I ain't thinkin' 'bout nothin' but the big money
Big cake, big shrimp on a big plate
Nigga so iced out like a snowflake
Don't hate, big crib wit' the big lake
Say she wanna taste, some of that milkshake
Put'cha money where ya ass at and run that
Just gettin' started nigga we done done that
What you know about them folks that was shootin' it off?
While y'all was lyin', runnin' and movin' ya moss
Homeboy we ain't goin' for the okie doke
Cause we'll pop it off quick wit' the gunsmoke
See what I tote? Keep it in my lap
If these hollow points hit'cha nigga it's a wrap

[Hook 2]

[Verse 3]
Yeah I ain'tsta... don't die naan nigga
Rich Boy, Alabama ex-figure
Stack quicker, drank good hard liquor
Fuck a squad, better have God wit'cha
Cool like a muh'fucka wit' a pimp cup
All my folk gettin' money put'cha rank up
Yeah real deal playa, gon' ball out
Come drank what'cha drank 'til ya fall out
Where my girls at baby, make 'em pay mo'
Gon' show a nigga how you make it shake slow
Yeah, represent tell 'em who ya clique
Throw 'em up nigga gon' show 'em who ya wit'

[Hook 2]
