[Verse One: Soulja Boy]
Sittin up in the classroom, she gettin on my nerves
The teacher talin 'bout, "Soulja Boy do yo' work"
She talkin 'bout adjectives, pronouns, and verbs
I'm knocked out, I ain't hearin nuttin the class heard
I'm daydreamin hard bout that Stacks on Deck
But I don't know how I'm gon' pass my next test
I got my 'port card, I'm like what the hell is this
I took it back to the teacher and then I told her

[Verse Two: Arab]
I always be in school but I be walkin halls
A lot of teachers give me tests, but they be super hard
I get into some trouble then my momma calls
But after I get out the office I'mma tell 'em all that I'mma superstar
And that's best
Everytime you see me up in class my head on the desk
And when you see me on them girls you know that I'm superfresh
Yeah teachers, students
Class, stupid (AYYYYY~!)
