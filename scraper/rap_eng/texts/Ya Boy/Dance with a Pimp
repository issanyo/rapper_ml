[Chorus: Ya Boy]
Baby girl wanna dance with a pimp
Dance with a pimp
Dance with a pimp
It go left, right, front to back
You can find me where's jumping at
Baby girl wanna dance with a pimp
Dance with a pimp
Dance with a pimp
It go right, left, back to front
You can find me in V.I.P rollin' the blunt

[Verse 1: Kevin Federline]
K-Fed, I'm the pimp of all pimps
Mack of all macks, back as your whack
Same old dude in the yankee blow cap
Same old dude, tell your girl to fall back
Wrist so icy, in that fresh white tee
Pimps so lighting, kicks so nike
Call so blitting, brought so tempting
Pockets like my whip, never all empty
Dudes hate K-Fed
Girls love K-Fed
It don't matter to me 'cause K-Fed is K-Fed
Y'all can eat too, you're boring me too
Tell your girl to stop callin' me dude
But she can come dance with a pimp
Hands in the pants, put your ass like this
Come dance like this, make it crack like this
You can find K-Fed in the black like this

[Chorus: Ya Boy]
Baby girl wanna dance with a pimp
Dance with a pimp
Dance with a pimp
It go left, right, front to back
You can find me where's jumping at
Baby girl wanna dance with a pimp
Dance with a pimp
Dance with a pimp
It go right, left, back to front
You can find me in V.I.P rollin' the blunt

[Chorus: Ya Boy]

Baby girl wanna dance with a pimp

Dance with a pimp
It go right, left, back to front
You can find me in V.I.P rollin' the blunt
