[Intro]
We all about them Bills
We all about them Bills

[Hook: Cik.Money]
I'm about my Bills like Stevie Johnson
All my women throw it back like I caught an option
Money on my mind, money on my conscious
I'm all about my Bills, I'm on my Stevie Johnson

[Verse 1: Ya Boy]
Bills in my duffle yo, you don't want trouble bro
Heat in my pocket, heart cold like Buffalo
I would just hustle one thing, but I need options
That work about to touch down, call it Steve Johnson
Catch me flying through the field like "Who want beef?"
It's 25 but I could get it for the 1-3
Certified Fly Guy, you on my time
I'm really real and you as real as a Sci-fi
I'm trying to bring it home baby, it's our time
They cheering for me like I'm cross the one yard line
And I'm all about my bills like Stevie Johnson
(Black Card Boys, yes, BCB we poppin')
Get that dough straight across like I'm running streaks
My bills come in hundreds, my women come in threes
This hater ran up on Ya Boy like he was furious
I lifted up my shirt like, "Why so serious?"

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Cik.Money]
Shawty got her tights on, her figure awesome
Im fly to fashion critics like, "What that cost him?"
I'm on my Stevie Johnson, bills like I'm Stevie Johnson
Meaning I stay with that green like I'm Aaron Rodgers
My fitted - Oakland A's, quarter Dodgers
Your career hanging by a rope, you second string
I'm in the game, how the hell could you be next to me?
They on my swagger safe the series is a pilot
I'm 'bout my money, no paper trail, don't wire it
Everything in the streets must be done Wallace
Over a burn, out in person or a pay phone
I rep the West like the big homie Dr. Dre doin'
I'm trying to bring may back like may gone
My haters want to see my fall, but I ain't stopin'
Never came across T.I.P., big things poppin'
Not just me, my whole team on they Stevie Johnson

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ya Boy]
My main bad, but she twerk clean
I'm 'bout to score like SJ13
I don't go to sleep, I go to the bank honey
So I don't count sheep, I count money
Diamond in my face, I like to shine a lot
Cash by the briefcase cuz I rhyme a lot
I spent $100,000 on this tiny clock
Ice all in the face, who cares about what time I got?
I go hard for them bills, call me Stevie Johnson
Check my garage I got wheels like Stevie Johnson
Bruh, pass it off to me, I'm en route
Your girl slippin digits to me cuz she think I'm cute
I hit it five times, and she gets the boot
I'm on my Stevie Johnson, I got shit to do
I'm working with a dirty dozen like Charles Bronson
Anything for them Bills, Stevie Johnson

[Hook]
