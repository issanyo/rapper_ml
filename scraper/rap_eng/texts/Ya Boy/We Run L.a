One for the money, two for the show
Hit the Louis store right on Rodeo
White SL, the color of Yayo
Pass the cup to my girl and told her to sip slow
This my show, watch me baby, The way i go can't stop me baby
Seatbelt beside me baby, LA just drive me crazy
We could float through the city night, im drunk and your lookin real pretty right
Make love i ain't finna fight
Not once, we can go till we get it right
What it cost i can fit the price
Got a house in hills you can spend the night
When they ask who turns you out

(Chorus)
She came from over-seas
To be a star on the boulevard
She wants sex on the beach
We can share, its only fair
Ive got paradise on call, its ours, its ours!
She got a little taste and she wants more, some moreee
We run L.A!
Yeh, cut alot of girls, cut alot of cheques
Thats the life here on sunset
Rich and famous i am sucess
Met her at Les Deux and she do love sex
Ima sip this, you do the rest
You know what you do, you do the best
Do me a favour, lose the dress
Its nice by the way, Chanel i guess
LAMB handbags i know where they sell those
Maybe later on we can hit Melrose
All you gotta do is hit me on my cellphone
Baby girl me and you can kick it like a field goal
Know who i be, call me YB
Red carpet i dont need the I.D
Cazals on my face, you dont see what i see
(Where) Girl you know where i be
(Where) Hollywood Swingin'
(Thats right) Hollywood Swingin'
(Thats right) Hollywood Swingin'
(Where) Girl you know where i be
(Where) Hollywood Swingin'
(Thats right) Hollywood Swingin'
(Thats right) Hollywood Swingin'

(Chorus)
She came from over-seas
To be a star on the boulevard
She wants sex on the beach
We can share, its an all in affair
Ive got paradise on call, its ours, its ours!
She got a little taste and she wants more, some moreee
We run L.A!
