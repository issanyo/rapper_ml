I like girls that like girls
So they have an open invitation to my world
If you know one, I am open to referrals
So go and tell a girl to tell a girl, to tell a girl
(Girl, girl, girl)
I like girls that like me
So you and me and her can have a fun menage-a-three
Let's party in the club, in the whip or in the sheets
Doesn't matter how we party, long as I am in-between
There's something about her, there's something about you
There's something about us, that makes me just want to
So we can have fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
'Cause 2 is better than 1
There's something about her, there's something about you
There's something about us, that makes me just want to
So we can have fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
