(Pre-Hook)
Spent 100 thousand on blue jeans
I’m too fly
Off a molly pill with a blue dream
I’m too high
Louis shades when I’m on the scene
I’m too shy
The new 30 with a new beam
I’m the new guy

(Hook)
Got a new watch and a new whip
I’m the new guy
Got a new chain and a new bitch
I’m the new guy
Got a new plug and a new flip
I’m the new guy
Get some new Nikes, I want new shit
I’m the new guy

(Verse)
New Phantom with a new driver
I’m laid back
These niggas know that they bitches love me
And they hate that
Count 100 thousand in 3 weeks
You can’t make that
My bitch told me we bout to eat
Grab a place mat
I like boojy bitches, I don’t like rats
Got expensive taste
She got way bit fat and I don’t like that
Get up out my face
I got a lot of money, no time
Check the Rolex
They ain’t heard since ‘09
We tried to protest
That new money gave me a new name
(What’s yo name?)
Rich Rocka
This fully auto turn into beef
(turn into what?)
To a shrimpostor
They love me cuz I keep it real
(you be trill?)
You a impostor
You a actor nigga, you don’t need a deal
You need to go outchea
Smoke a lot of cookies, I’m from the bay
(I’m from the bay)
Rest in peace Oscar
Them boys be out here tryna kill a nigga
Gotta sleep with choppas
Them young boys givin niggas shots
And they ain’t even down
‘Cus them hoes know I come brand new
I’m Rich Rocka, they wanna lick the rocks

(Verse)
I got a new plug, where yo order at?
Everything half off
My little brother pay quarterback
You need something passed off
Black engine with no miles
That’s brand new
The weather man say it’s a storm comin
I’m an onyx bitch but they bad news
New Gucci grip with the Christmas colors
Happy holidays
If you step out you might get spotted
They gon rock today
I want all the money, yall can keep the fame
I’ve been grew up
These women know me, don’t speak the same
They gon choose us
New Forgiatos, I ain’t playin with em
That’s big boy
We might fuck them hoes but I ain’t layin with me
That money callin
I’m undefeated like Money Mane
And it’s trap shit but ain’t none of my niggas rappers
They just rap shit
I got a cellphone with no numbers saved
You know what that means
I’m a boss nigga, I be sittin runners
Like the track team
I got a new Glock with a 30 stick
I’m the new guy
She gon put molly and try Rocka (I’m Rich Rocka)
I’m the new high
