Nigga I walk it like I talk it and talk it like I walk it
Keep the revolver sparking, coppers gone have to chalk em
Often I be flossing, caution when you cross em or your next move's a white suit and coffin
Oh, they say I'm trouble no board game
I put a scope on the K thats for sure aim
Whats your name girl I am YB
And I'm all about the bills like cosby
I be hard as a rhinoceros body
And my flow is tighter than the eyes on the Chinese
In New York they be like YB's nice
Niggas know I can go like a green light
Eastside gangster, westside criminal, southside monster, north cali original
They be on that ho shit, I be on that moe shit
Flynes third 23rd? all about my doe bitch
Louie Vuiton on my ho fit
Top to bottom it's all on a ho bitch
Crack and the doors lift back like the fo fifth Jordan
Whole click riding with a road trip
Leave a hater cold stiff, act like you know this
Fo fo let it go on some Keisha Cole shit
I said nigga act like you know this
Fo fo let it go on some Keisha Cole shit
