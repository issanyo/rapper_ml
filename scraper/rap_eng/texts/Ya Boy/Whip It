[Intro]
I whip it, I whip it
I'm from the golden state

[Hook]
I whip it, I whip it into a new estate
I whip, I whip you see them diner plates
I whip, I whip it, I whip it into shape
You know I whip it, you know I whip it, ay

[Verse 1]
5, 50 cleaners [?] with my cousin [?]
Couple bitches trailing behind us, but we ain't loving 'em
30s in 'em hammers for cocky niggas, we humble them
Turbo'd up, ready for some, action lets find come trouble then
Ready for the camera every time I walk the house
Badder bitch from Panama, all she want is me in her mouth
Whip it like a slave, in my living room, all she see is couch
Whippin' in the kitchen, she on the plane it's up in her crotch
Whippin' up a Rari, I'm cookin' that money on the low
Can't stop and I'm sorry, can't conversate cuz I'm on the go
Whippin' up that collage tuition, I made the honor role
Whippin' up a classic, it got to be at least a million sold

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Bitch, you see us and stuntin' and flexin' that mean we earnin' that
On the rode to riches you bitches there ain't no turning back
[?] with yola with baking soda I was servin' that
[?] wrap a nigga up like a turban hat
Money on my money 9-5, never heard of that
All my money dirty, my nigga where the detergent at?
Smokin' like a [?] my trippy stick always burning wax
Every time I crack a sprite open, I throw some purp in that
Panoramic view from my vehicle, we watchin' stars
Auntie got some paper? I'm whippin' her up a flight tomorrow
[?] got a need for need with exotic cars
Whippin' up a house with no neighbors that means I'm probably far

[Hook]
