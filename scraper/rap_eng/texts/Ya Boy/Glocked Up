[Verse 1]
Cali I got it locked up, all my niggas glocked up
So you don't need a UBS slip to get boxed up
I'm a street nigga, baby that's the bottom line
So I been a convict before I signed a dotted line
It's the rockstar, look at the difference they got him signed
Now I'm in, turned Hip Hop into columbine
Niggas gotta eat, and I'm hungry like I never ate
I fucked the rap game and never took it on a second date
Signed to Kon Live, now watch my whole worth levitate
So if you on the 16, you gone need a better rate
As a youngin in the bay, I was on fire fool
Now I'm double hot, Black Card and a fire pool
Hottest D in the Game, niggas better audible
I'm sunnin' these rap niggas no biological
Lemme tell you this, if you make it out the ghetto zoo
Bitch niggas hate, real niggas say "I'm proud of you"
I know it's not logical, but something gotta give
Either you real or fake, clown it is what it is
Pop a tears get your mind right, girl I'm like a klondike
What would you do for your boy and his limelight
All I need is nine dykes, lotta ass, my type
Say they love the pussy, but genitals how they climb pipe
Shoul've been signed twice, matter fact, three times
Superstar still on the corner like a street sign
Rock be the fenom, these niggas 'pee-on's
Fee line, you know I shit on every beat I breath on
Creep like tea pies, pullup in a Neon
Wake a nigga up on the wrong fella to sleep on
Nigga get ya snore on, Imma get my tour on
Put your helmet on, lace your boots, you in the war zone
Cook him like (di giorno?) pockets on (gordo?)
Hit em up, burner get more play than a porno
Mask down, Zorro! Hangin' out the four door
Young nigga squeeze, say cheese no photo
Land of the loco, where they hop low-low's
Black Card boy, bentley wings be the logo

[Outro]
Sittin' in my Cadillac, rollin' with your boy
Niggas tryna hold us back, but we ain't goin' for it
Rollin' up in an all black tee
Pullin five bullets on the kid
On a leather case a nigga trip
You better go with that shit

[3x repeat]
I'm glocked up (Don't make me crowl)

Noooooo! It's Kon Live!

It's Kon Live!
