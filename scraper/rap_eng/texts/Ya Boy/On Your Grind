[Hook]

Are you on your grind, cause I'm on mine
I be on the paper chase even if I gotta catch a case
Cause I gotta get paid
I'm talking like 6 in the morning
On the block I'm grinding while you yawning
These other niggas just wishing and hoping
Maybe one day you could be like Ya Boy

[Verse 1]

Yeah, I got money on my mind
Lately I've been feeling like I'm falling behind
Cause while they riding Lambos, I'm flipping channels
All I see is violence, Frank Lucas and Rambo
Sopranos, Goodfellas and shit
MTV they singing about umbrellas and shit
I gotta get up, get out and get something, hustling
How can you complain when you ain't doing nothing [x2]
I go against the grain for that Range
Nigga I risk jail for mail let me tell you
I'm on my grind, I gotta get mine and I ain't got time for a bitch I ain't lying
Everytime I close my eyes I see dollar signs open em up
It ain't about a dime then I'm blind
And I don't care if you in the streets or you a Pastor
I got a quick question to ask ya

[Hook]


[Verse 2]

Uh, I'm trying to live the boss life
I feel its only right since Ya Boy the boss type
Like, houses on the hill probably worth a couple mill
Every minute of the hour I'm making a dollar bill
Lambos and Rari's, trips and safari's, threesomes with the (Lisa's and the Gicari's?)
Wouldn't it be nice just to take a night flight
On your own private jet not a hater in sight
Right, we gotta get up on our grind
They say black people like to sit on their behind
So we gotta prove em wrong, listen to the song
He ain't talking about a dollar tell that nigga move along
She ain't adding to the pot tell that bitch kick rocks
Gotta grind for each other if we wanna see the top
And I don't care if you a singer or an actor
I got a quick question to ask ya

[Hook]
