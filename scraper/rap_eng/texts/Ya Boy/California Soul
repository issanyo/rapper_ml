[Hook: Marlena Shaw]
Like a sound you hear
That lingers in your ear
But you can't forget
From sundown to sunset
It's all in the air
You hear it everywhere
No matter what you do
It's gonna grab a hold on you

[Verse 1: Ya Boy]
Killa Cali hustler
Get it by all means
The people know whatever they need
They can call me
California hustlin'
Movin and we musclin'
And we don't fuck with the pigs like a Muslim
For the green we rushin'
No, not Moscow, I'm talking quick, fast
In a hurry right now
Can't be a victim, can't fall short
I just wanna be a baller with my own ball court
California hustling

[Hook: Marlena Shaw]
California soul, California soul
Feels good!

[Verse 2: Marlena Shaw]
Like a sound you hear
That lingers in your ear
But you can't forget
From sundown to sunset
[Ya Boy]
That's the code of the street mentality
One minute you're on top and the next you're a casualty
[Marlena Shaw]
It's all in the air
You hear it everywhere
No matter what you do
It's gonna grab a hold on you
[Ya Boy]
It's gonna grab a hold on you if you let it
[Marlena Shaw]
California Soul
[Ya Boy]
California hustler, california hustler
[Marlena Shaw] Woo, feels good

[Verse 3: Ya Boy]
See I lived through the fear
Shed a lot of tears
There's a reason why my friend died here
For the hustle, for the California hustle
So get your hustle... [???]

[Marlena Shaw]
Puts a brand new kind of thinking in your mind
And you can't go wrong
Cause you're groovin' all day long

[Ya Boy]
Yeah, I feel you baby!
California hustlin!
I got the soul of a saint
Heart of a lion, I go hard in the paint
Put some paint where it ain't
Put a wig on the big
I won't stop til my [toes?] stretch long as a bridge
Movin through the streets in my Lincoln
Get it all night while the whole world's sleeping
In the fast lane where they staying for a reason
Cuz their handshake dont match the way they speaking
Top getting closer and I'm still reachin
If you looking for me I be hustling in my region
California hustler
Yeah - see life has it's lessons when you a California hustler

[Marlena Shaw]
So happy they were rockin' and reelin'
Because they added that lovin' feeling
[Ya Boy]
Take em to church
Yeah - put your best foot forward
Or become a victim of these streets
[Marlena Shaw]
To California soul, California soul
[Ya Boy]
Hustle, hustleGet it, get it
Money make the world go round (x3)
