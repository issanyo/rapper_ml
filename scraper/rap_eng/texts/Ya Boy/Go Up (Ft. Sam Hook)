(Intro)
Yall like this
It definitely sound like Rich Rocka
Aye

(Verse)
Ridin round my city
Like Steve Young in ‘94
Hunneds all in my pockets
Callin plates for my iPhone
I put it down for my city
Everywhere that I go
My amigos touch down
Had to cancel like 5 shows I’m fresh out of that Nina
Cashier got mad at me
Had er there for like 30 minutes
My yellow bitch done got back happy
I run the city like coppin it
Feature price like half a brick
On Activist with a Spanish bitch
And my wrist lit like candle stick
I’m getting money on niggas
Streets callin me Rich Rocka
Rock Versace like Big Popa
Turn a college bitch to a pill popper
I’m getting money on bitches
Reservations at crustaceans
Foreign whip got her heart racin
She star gazin, bitch

(Hook)
Welcome to the city (it’s my city)
Real niggas ride with me
Fuck getting ones, I’m tryna get that 50
(50 what?) 50 million
(Turn up) Gold stacked to that ceiling
(Turn up) Gold stacked to that ceiling
(Turn up) Gold stacked to that ceiling
Going up (go up up up)
Going up (go up up up)
Going up (go up up up)
Going up (go up up up)

(Verse)
Ridin round my city
Like Montana in ‘89
Rich Rocka that new nigga
Heard that through the grape vine
Yea I’m smoking like Snoopie
Be the nigga on cloud 9
Going after that tank top
My city on, it’s about time
I still carry that lightning
‘Cause niggas don’t like to see you shine
Hundred bands on that brightening
And a nigga still never on time
Bad bitches, all dimes
Weed strands, all kinds
Feds all on my car lots
‘Cus I’m getting money like all the time
YSL my belt buckle
Yall bitches sure is lookin
Smoke all in my residence
They like how nigga sure is cookin
My whip flyin round like Hancock
High, blowin on Shamrock
My domie on that gwop
I grind homie, I can’t stop

(Hook)
Welcome to the city (it’s my city)
Real niggas ride with me
Fuck getting ones, I’m tryna get that 50
(50 what?) 50 million
(Turn up) Gold stacked to that ceiling
(Turn up) Gold stacked to that ceiling
(Turn up) Gold stacked to that ceiling
Going up (go up up up)
Going up (go up up up)
Going up (go up up up)
Going up (go up up up)
