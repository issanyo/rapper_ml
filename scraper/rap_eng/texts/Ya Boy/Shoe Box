[Hook]
You know I keep at least a hundred grand (in my shoe box)
I keep the ounces and the grams (in my shoe box)
I keep the baggies and the rubber bands (in my shoe box)
Don't let me catch you with your hand (in my shoe box)
I don't think you really understand (in my shoe box)
I keep a gun that won't jam (in my shoe box)
Don't let me catch you with your hand (in my shoe box)

[Verse 1]
A hundred grand, three or four Air Force boxes
I'm the man, black Land plat Porsche Boxster
Higher than a satellite, no this ain't NASA
But I got a chain 'bout the price of me casa
And it all started from a few rocks honey
I don't believe in banks, I got shoe box money
I got new Glock money, so who want it with me man?
Pumping all those weights like you trying to be He-Man
Two or three grand get you couple of D's man
Two four-fives nigga, one for each hand
Smoke a few haters then it's back in the shoe box
Take another grand out, stuff it in my tube socks
Time to go shoppin', time to go coppin'
You niggas working with one whip, I got options
Thirty-one flavors and all them bangs topless
Money ain't a thing, look here I got boxes

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got a Jordan 10 box I can fit fifty stacks in
All hundred dollar bills, stacked up, packed in
Fuck all that gossip, better bring the facts in
Golf balls in my ears heavy like fat men
Bezzy on the watch, real heavy on the cost
Look at my rims, tell Mims this is why I'm hot
I just get it off the lot, money spend it by the box
And I get that white work delivered by the block
See I'm a corner guy, street dude, block nigga
And everything I love most in this box nigga
So put your hand in it, I'll put your mans in it
My shoe box will have you and your mans missin'
Bottom line, is I'm out of my mind
And my mind stay on the money a lot of the time
A lot of dimes, a lot of shine, I'm out on the grind
But I don't mind, I'm a hustler, I don't just rhyme

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My momma found my shoe box when I was fifteen
I snatched it back like "Mom, it's just weed!"
See back then I didn't know what the crack was
Know about four-fives and know what a stack was
All I knew about was ten sacks and Backwoods
Fuck basketball, couldn't touch the backboard
So while they was dunking and passing dimes
I was breaking 'em down cause I was trying to get high
Two or three years later I was trying to get fly
Hit the street started selling my own supply
No lie, all money made straight to the shoe box
Five hundred dollars sitting next to the 2Pac
Collection, right there close the lid
Wake up next morning I'mma do it again
Now I'm a baller baby, I'm doing it big
Touch my shoe box, I'll put two in your wig

[Hook]
