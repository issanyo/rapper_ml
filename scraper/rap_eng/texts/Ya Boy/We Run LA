De me baby
LA just drive me crazy
We could float thru the city night
I'm drunk and you lookin real pretty right
Make love, i ain't finna fight
Not once we can go til we get it right
With the cars that can fit the price
Got a house in the hills
You can spend the night, and when they ask who turned you out...
She came from overseas, to be a star on the boulevard
She wants sex on the beach
We can share, its only fair
I got paradise on call, its ours, its ours
She got a little taste and she wants more, some more
We run LA
Yeah
Cut a lotta girls, cut a lotta checks
Thats the life here on sunset
Rich and famous i am success
Better act late doin she do love sex
Ima sip this you do the rest
You know what you do, you do the best
Do me a favor lose the dress
Its nice by the way chanel, i guess
LAMB handbags, dunno where they sell those
Maybe later on we can hit melrose
All you gotta do is hit me on my cell phone
Baby girl me and you can kick it like a field goal
U know who i be call me YB
Red carpet don't need the ID
Cause on my face you don't see what i see
You know where i be hollywood swinging
She came from overseas, to be a star on the boulevard
She wants sex on the beach
We can share its only fair
I got paradise on call, its ours, its ours
She got a little taste and she wants more, some more
We run LA
