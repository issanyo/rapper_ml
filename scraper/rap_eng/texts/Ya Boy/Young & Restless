[Hook: Jah Free]
Everywhere I go it's like
All eyes on me I'm the life tonight
It's like alllllllllllll day we young and reckless
Can't no body take us downnnn
Look at who's laughing nowwwww
Hahaha hahaha
We young and reckless

[Verse One: Bishop Lamont]
I know I be a superstar even as a kid
So I said fuck school mama mad that I did
But then she changed her mind when I bought her that crib
Swore on my life one day I make it big
Stand behind my word homie like my ad libs
So when I say it's meant to be, it already is
Rappers all mad when I speak the truth
You think I'm talking to you nigga I'm on my Bluetooth
Can't walk in my shoes each step a commute
A giant when I stride you little bugs is minute
In '93 Mef said "get that C.R.E.A.M."
Different world now the doors flip 'em like a dean
Fresh ass ride
I'm awake when I dream
I think I'm perfect with low self esteem
Life too short so I live like Yao Ming
And you should too, Free tell em what we mean

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Ya Bo]
Hey
Young and reckless
Guns and necklaces
If you and with it I show you where the exit is
We entering the building y'all exiting
Now tell me how many of y'all want to test the kid?
I rob your man and the man next to him
So they both getting licked like lesbians
There ain't a nigga breathing air that could mess with him
Should we start at the beginning well let's begin
It started in the streets
Moving crack like crack in the concrete
Guns in my arm reach
Nigga I emerged from the dirt like a zombie
Now I got 'bout five birds on my arm piece
See I'm a certified hustler
You a snitch
Nigga you be singing like Usher
Fuck ya
And fuck the
Niggas that love ya
I come to wreck shit
Eat guns for breakfast
I'm young and reckless

[Hook]

[Verse Three:Jah Free]
Young and reckless yeahhhhhhhh
As we proceed to get get that greed
Yeah
Money in my pocket
Lord knows I can't stop it
And if I could, if I could
I probably wouldn't
Cause I'm so in love
But I'm sayin I'm a fool with it

[Hook]
