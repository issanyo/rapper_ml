Light out
My Rolex shinin' like a light house
You can still see this bitch with the lights out
If that bitch ain't bad turn the lights out
We ain't trippin' we outside 'till it's light out
I know some niggas that'd come and shoot you lights out
I know some niggas that'd shine and now they lights out
Lights out nigga, lights out


[Verse 1]
I'm in buildin' bitch I'm in the buildin'
Work in the kitchen can't work with no feelins'

Where you headed niggas, I'm winnin' I tell 'em [?]
Four vehicules, light out that's how we creep up

I'm a different breathin' nigga I promess I'm like no other
I'mma tell a bitch the truth before I tell her I love her
Hey you heard I fucked you bitch bruh? You ain't gotta wonder
If she ain't talkin' money then I don't got her number
