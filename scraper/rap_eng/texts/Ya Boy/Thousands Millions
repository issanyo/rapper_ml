[Verse 1]
Pops used to ride me around in an Alfa Romeo
Feel the sweat so rockin them gazelles
Head it down knife middle left on fail
Talkin on the sale when the agent's getting mail
I just soaked it up peek game let it dwell
Now in my twenties and I’m doing quite well
It ain't hard to tell she loves it when I smell
Like Chanel when I love her when she bring another gall
Thirty one flavors and spit the hotel
Thirty one favors promise I won’t tell
She wanna fuck a hustler so I let her try me
Might let her ride me but don’t need to beside me
I’m tryin get money and hoes be the speed bump
All she keep telling me is everything that she want
Tell me to slow down I tell her to keep up
If you can’t be down baby you could be up
I ain’t got time to catch feelings
I’m sitting here tryin to catch a million
Tryin to make my money stack up to the ceiling
Remember when I used to hit the block and make a killing

[Hook]
I’m just sitting back loungin
Getting high counting my thousands
Waiting on the call from my accountant
Talking bout a dealing god damn for real man
Can a street nigga make a million?
I'm talking bout thousands, millions, thousands, millions
Remember when I used to hustle in front of the building
Thousands, millions, thousands, millions
Can a nigga make a million?

[Verse 2]
Countin' more road day all
Whip like four days old
Rose bottle came slow
Pocket full of bank rolls
Trappin and they finna send 'em when I say go
Bad bitch and she never ever say no
Every other day never with the same ho
Every nigga rappin but they all can’t blow
I must be dead if a nigga ain’t on
Say it ain’t so, tell me I ain’t on your screen
Buried bombs with the whole team
I don’t need love I just need lean
Pour a double cup while I roll my weed
Put it on me, young YB let the world know I hold down the SFC
Started on the bridge when it cross the sea
Got it how I live, it's the boss in me

[Hook 2x]
I’m just sitting back loungin
Getting high counting my thousands
Waiting on the call from my accountant
Talking bout a dealing god damn for real man
Can a street nigga make a million?
I'm talking bout thousands, millions, thousands, millions
Remember when I used to hustle in front of the building
Thousands, millions, thousands, millions
Can a nigga make a million?
