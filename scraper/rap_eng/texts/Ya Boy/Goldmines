(Chorus)
So if you don't mind
Could we turn back the clock and rewind
May the moon never sell out the sunshine
And dry all the tears that we've cried
I've been blind now all I see is Gold Mines (X4)

(Verse 1)
Baby who you with?
Drop that lame come get with a pimp
Ain't trying to play games
Just trying to get rich
Grab your hard-hat I got my pick
Meet me in the goldmine
Love if you don't mind
Let's start fresh we can throw away our old lives
Money, cars, the whole 9
This what I've been waiting on my whole life
Remember when i said we would get rich?
Around this time the year was '06
I was driving a blue honda, no tints
You was driving that '92 focus
Now everywhere we go people notice
You held me down when I ain't have no chips
I wrote this for you 'cause I owe this
We on, oh shit!

(Chorus)
So if you don't mind
Could we turn back the clock and rewind
May the moon never sell out the sunshine
And dry all the tears that we've cried
I've been blind now all I see is Gold Mines (X4)

(Verse 2)
No more broke days
I ain't even worried about the old days
Now they see me getting money both ways
On my stairway to heaven like the OJ's
Now it's rare that I drive
'cause I keep it G5 like a X-file
Treat the bentley azure like an accord
Baby we ain't gotta hitch rides no more
On the road to riches trying to get paid
Tell success i'm 30 minutes away
Little bit of kush, little bit of rozay
You by my side now it's time to start my day
More intense than 50 pair shoes
Girl you so fly you need a parachute
How good can you see with closed eyes?
Open them up...

(Chorus)
So if you don't mind
Could we turn back the clock and rewind
May the moon never sell out the sunshine
And dry all the tears that we've cried
I've been blind now all I see is Gold Mines (X4)
