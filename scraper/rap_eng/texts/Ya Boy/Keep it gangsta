(run up its a wrap)suggest you stay in yo lane bra
Cuz you dont even know me like that
Hey look hotter than a sauna
Pattern leather pradas
Laguna beach jeans on looking like a rocker
Fresh to death but yo i still keep a llama
Long neck on the 44 for the drama
Bay 49er kush marijuana
Got a n**** higher than a flying ariline
Clothes be designer guns be designer
Glocks to the smiths and even the six tires
Who cares if they saw ya
Ask for ya lawyer
I know you love the streets but the street gon destroy ya
Nothin in the hood but the goons and the goblins
Ain't nothing good just the killing and the robbin
But i love the hood i love everything about it
I promise i could survive in anybody's project
I keep it gangsta but still on some fly s***
Now baby girl tell me know what you know about this
Gangsta
(40 cal click clack) so please dont put yo life in danger
(man you know i stay strapped)full clip plus one in the chamber
(run up its a wrap)suggest you stay in yo lane bra
Cuz you dont even know me like that
Smokers and tooters broads with the hooters
Ain't nothing in the hood but the ballers and shooters
I rememebr pops had a 86 cougar
The crack came in and it was benzes and lex luthers(?)
Basketball night games turned into dice games
Uncle fat rat mixed the cream with the white cane
Some n****s might hang some n****s might bang
No matter what i did i made sure i kept my thang
Had a lil 25 in the trunk
Laronn from the back taught me how to keep it tucked
Me and sep we used to let it bust just for fun
I got a bad temper and i never been a punk
I really sold rocks n**** you can ask jimmy
About page street and the deals we would give me
I know i stay fresh and im dressed to kill
But still
N****s know i keep it gangsta
(40 cal click clack) so please dont put yo life in danger
(man you know i stay strapped)full clip plus one in the chamber
