[Verse 1]
I was outside hustlin' till I got mine
Hard pole, eyes red like a stop sign
By the stop sign posted with a Glock nine
You never sold a rock rap nigga stop lyin'
I was right there, no green screen
Young nigga movin' rock like a dream team
Make the feind scream, servin' the supreme cream
My nigga V's had two for the fifteen
My nigga Jimmy wouldn't even let the brick breathe
On the grind movin' dimes off the ten speed
I'm just tryna get a dollar bruh my ribs touchin'
Late night stop and cope like it did somethin'
Filmore made a nigga what I am now
From the gram, to the ounce, to the damn pound
Born in the view family in the point two
I used to love gettin' ten for the point two
Where I'm posted on the block with a fifty shot
Yesterday I coulda swore I dodged fifty cops
Young nigga but I'm feelin' like a OG
If you say I ain't real you don't know me

[Hook]
Hustle
Hustle
Hustle

[verse 2]
Uh, grove street baggin' work on a late night
Rockin' on the stage well you niggas got stage fright
Fuck daylight I'm tryna I'm tryna get my pay right
And fuck the police keep my jays lace tight
Yeah, broke it down with a thumb tap
Crack residue on my granny dinner plate
On my stove but it's fresh off the inner state
Forty on me nigga get a body 'for I get a case
My dreads messed up
I just stuck my dick in a hair dresser
Free hair dude
Bail money to the side I'm prepared dude
You can speak to the boys I don't care too
I keep my mouth shut and my eyes wide open
In the hood gettin' money with them guys scopin'
Tryna make it out some niggas got hopin'
So imma get it right here till the sky open
