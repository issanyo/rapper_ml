[Chorus:]
Ya Boy who to talk about
And if there's hoes in the club we gon' walk 'em out
Mtv, I've never been there before
But they all wanna go cause they already know where I'm (going)
Yeah straight to the top
I already wear your advance in my watch
Bet, I've never been there before
But they all wanna roll cause they already know where I'm (going)

[Verse 1:]
Is he blood is he cause
I don't really know but I know he got bucks
Everything he own got it sittin' on dubs
If he stay in the club gettin' high pourin' bub
Ya boy live a rock star life
Come home every night to a pop star wife
We both have a ball baby
Threesomes and all
They all get low windows to the wall
And I'm not Lil' John
But I make em' get naked with their high heels on
She could be a black broad like Christina Milian
Or, a tall blonde like Paris Hilton
She ask what I do
I say get money
And I'm gonna do that until the Reaper come for me
Call me Ya Boy cause erbody love me
Just in case you forgot bring the hook back for me
I'm (going)

[Chorus:]
Ya Boy who to talk about
And if there's hoes in the club we gon' walk 'em out
Mtv, I've never been there before
But they all wanna go cause they already know where I'm (going)
Yeah straight to the top
I already wear your advance in my watch
Bet, I've never been there before
But they all wanna roll cause they already know where I'm (going)

[Verse 2:]
Five hundred dollars for the tune
Five hundred dollars for the shoes
Shit this Gucci's new
Got a little Asian broad like Lucy Liu
As for that red I'll show ya what the hoochie do
Got the whole world talkin'
Who this dude?
He remind me of Too Short cause his mouth is rude
And he so West Coast like Snoop and Cube
But his flow like Jay-Z on the dj Clue
He's (going) goin' gone
They said I wouldn't make it so I gotta prove 'em wrong
These rappers ain't right so I gotta do 'em wrong
These hoes ain't shit so I gotta do 'em all
And you know I'm gonna ball like I'm eight feet tall
Cause my flow like sushi it so so raw
It means my career will be so so long
They know where I'm going so I had to do the song
Baby girl I'm (going)

[Chorus:]
Ya Boy who to talk about
And if there's hoes in the club we gon' walk 'em out
Mtv, I've never been there before
But they all wanna go cause they already know where I'm (going)
Yeah straight to the top
I already wear your advance in my watch
Bet, I've never been there before
But they all wanna roll cause they already know where I'm (going)

[Hook: x2]
Ain't no matter where I'm at
I know where I'm goin'
Put ya hands if ya already knowin'
Straight to the top
This shit don't stop
We're going going going going (going)

[Chorus:]
Ya Boy who to talk about
And if there's hoes in the club we gon' walk 'em out
Mtv, I've never been there before
But they all wanna go cause they already know where I'm (going)
Yeah straight to the top
I already wear your advance in my watch
Bet, I've never been there before
But they all wanna roll cause they already know where I'm (going)
