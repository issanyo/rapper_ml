I got a 40 cal & a black tre pound and they both go..
I got a 44 mag & a Glock in the stash and the both go..
AK-47 strapped on a mac 11 bet they both go..
A 22 ain't big but I got a chrome 6 and I make it go..

[Verse 1]

Uhh, when I aim the fifth I make em disappear on some Chris Angel shit
Two guns which one you wanna tangle with
Ask around I got stripes like a bengal bitch
Not Chad Donsun but this thing oh lady 5?
Let em fly your the opposite of conscious
Guns in my closet, TI baby
Not the normal guns this shit is GI baby
Government issue, handheld missles
There everywhere even my bitch got a pistol
And even my bitch's bitch got a pistol
I promise it'll be some sick shit if they get you
You better have your vest on at the front door
Cause my bedroom look like a gun show
You better run bro, guns like Motumbo
And when theres beef niggas get jacked like jumbo
YEAH!

[Verse 2]

I'm 4 deep in 03 ML, two desert eages cocked like fuck jail
Catch a hating nigga show em how the trunk smell
Cause we don't need haters, they like junk mail
Hold on I ain't finished yet
Now these rap niggas beefing on the internet
While they at home Myspacin'
I'm outside holdin' pumps like a gas station
I'm past racist, I got three K's
One shot make your body fly three ways
Car pooling, catch em on the freeway
Wherever he was going well his trip got delayed
See I'm back on my gangster shit
Got a 9mm with an extra clip
So when you pouring out liquor take an extra sip for yourself
Never know you could be next to RIP, nigga
