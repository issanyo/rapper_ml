(Hook)
They want to come and see me for my swag
I disappear like the genie in a aladdin
I don't mean to be so bragadaucious...
But I got this thing on lock, and you know this
(on lock) and you know this (6X)

(Verse 1)
Shorty shorty know I got the game on click clack
Shorty know I stay fresh no zip-lock
She know the price I payed for my wrist watch
She know my jewelry get cold when I get hot
When she cheat on her man she don't get popped
I'm in Japan we gon' we gon' when I get back
All action baby no chit chat
Met her at a kick-back, did her like a kit-kat
Ugh, YB so CA
Two light-skinned girls that's a three-way
They know I got game like EA
So you know I move fast like freeway
Everything for sale i'm like ebay
No D.Wade ma keep cream-ay
I'm balling and I don't need a teammate
Have this thing on lock get a key made

(Hook)
They want to come and see me for my swag
I disappear like the genie in a aladdin
I don't mean to be so bragadaucious...
But I got this thing on lock, and you know this
(on lock) and you know this (6X)

(Verse 2)
Shorty know I got it sold like a dope man
I'm from the city cross the bridge from Oakland
I'm drinking, she smoking
Little tiny purple nike pill got me rolling
Broke? My bank account swollen
In my own lane like a nigga going bowling
Them hoes say they love me but i don't know them
Them hoes give it to me but I don't owe them
In the V.I.P. chilling like champaign
All the pretty girls trying to join the campaign
Girl you know I had bitches before I had fame
Drunk in the club singing, but I can't sing!
I feel so fly with my shades on
You a hater i'm the nigga you should hate on
Like star in the function it's gon' rock
Can't get in he got it on lock

(Hook)
They want to come and see me for my swag
I disappear like the genie in a aladdin
I don't mean to be so bragadaucious...
But I got this thing on lock, and you know this
(on lock) and you know this (6X)

(Verse 3)
So cool no LL
And I got it on lock no jail cell
Polo T-shirt with a chanel smell
Say baby girl have you ever done Girl-Girl?
Last night I had patron in my OJ
Now i'm sippin that Polo Olay
I want her, and she want fore-play
Imma drink that like rozay
And your girl know I'm dope like cocaine
So your girl on my neck like gold chains
I swear your girl don't play no games
She do she do everybody, no shame
YB, I be in the door I don't need a ID
All this champaign got me on my body
Got this thing on lock and I swallowed my key

(Hook)
They want to come and see me for my swag
I disappear like the genie in a aladdin
I don't mean to be so bragadaucious...
But I got this thing on lock, and you know this
(on lock) and you know this (6X)
