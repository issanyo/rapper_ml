[Verse 1]
Started in the Bay then it spread to LA
Then it bounced out all way to the A
NYC the PHILA, I'm a cannon with a cannon bitch like L way
Bitch I'm the ball, I ball like MJ
I'm a D-Boy paperbag full of (gizzay?)
In a league of my own step your gizzame
Y'all can't fuck with me such as shenzei
My flow is nice cold as ice Rick James
Poltergeist ghost at night switch lanes
My dough is right frozen ice, sick name
I am the shrink my watch is insane
I'm a pimp so a ho is my 9 to 5
That means your bitch is mine if I decide
Get on top of the boy get the highest high
But you gotta be this tall to ride the ride, what's good!

[Hook]
Everywhere I go the same old shit
They already know that I'm no bitch
Only thing I own is this four fifth
Ten in the clip I let 'em go quick
East side they know what it is ay
West side they know what it is ay
North side they know what it is ay
South side they know what it is ay

[4x repeat]
(Takin' Ova) One city at a time, one city at a time, this city is mine

[Verse 2]
Floss, that's what I does, I cop whip after whip I'm such a thug nigga
Toss, that's what I does, I fuck bitch after bitch they all in love
This is my house shoes off at the door map
I like you I like sex I'm bored and
I even whip, I like neck I'm for that
Niggas hate all damn day I ignore that
Mad cause the ho see me and take Codex
Mad cause I find the dough I'm like Jowjack
Boy got towels and hoes I'm like Bo Jack
Call my mouth Walt Disney I froze that
Freeeeze! Rich Boy on on D's
One let her over bitch I'm on E'S
No I'm never sober bitch I smoke trees
So I'm high all the time, Get like me!

[Hook]
Everywhere I go the same old shit
They already know that I'm no bitch
Only thing I own is this four fifth
Ten in the clip I let 'em go quick
East side they know what it is ay
West side they know what it is ay
North side they know what it is ay
South side they know what it is ay

[verse 3]
I'm back better ease back
All the rap niggas fake pull the sheets back
Niggas talkin' bout guns never seen that
Niggas talkin' bout drugs where your CREAM at?
Where your team at?
I don't give fuck I run these streets
I am the west coast who want it with me?
The blades, the knives, the guns is with me
The block, the hood, the slums is with me
Dolce&Gabbana, her not me
Shades on my face, Versace
Gangstas, Hustlers, just like me
Wankstas, Bustas, don't stop me
You are what you eat, pussy not me!
Rapper you soft, and good she not me
Ain't tryna be you, I'm tryna be me
Heard the "Touch it" remix now I'm tryna be free

[Hook]
Everywhere I go the same old shit
They already know that I'm no bitch
Only thing I own is this four fifth
Ten in the clip I let 'em go quick
East side they know what it is ay
West side they know what it is ay
North side they know what it is ay
South side they know what it is ay

(Takin' Ova) One city at a time, one city at a time, this city is mine

[Verse 4]
It's Ya Boy lil daddy, ask around
If you want beef, my mask is down
Hip Hop, I'm tryna hold the crown
All the young niggas know I hold it down
For every borough block war that's on in town
Precise Gang my niggas hold the pounds
I gave rap breath y'all owe me now
Sittin way at the top feelin' lonely now
Arggh! I am the freak, I love brain and she loves me
I have aim, I shoot for three
I complain if she use teeth
Bitch I came you must repeat
Lock on (babe?) and don't release
While I'm drivin' the range this girl's a freak
Almost crashed the range I'm bout to skee
Now turn around ma and just might do ya
Things' so long might go right through ya
Call me Ya Boy and call him Junior
We bring joy Halleluja
She wants to ride call me scooter
But I want more brains okay miss Tuda
They want war then I cop the Uza
And put a whole through you losers, ya dig
