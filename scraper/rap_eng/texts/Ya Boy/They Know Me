[Chorus:]
The gangstas and ballas, They Know Me
Them bosses and shot callas, They Know Me
All the broads in the house, They Know Me
They know me, They know me, (They know me)
On the block in the hood, They Know Me
I won't get shot 'cause I'm good, They Know Me
Baby I wish a nigga would, They Know Me
They know me, They know me, (They know me)

[Verse 1:]
Ya boy step through, gucci this, gucci that
I spent 700 dollars on this gucci hat
In the streets in San Fran where they scoop me at
A rockstar, Mike Lin, where the groupies at?
I'm hollywood, but they know where my dudes be at
In the streets, put a shot where ya coufie at
Excuse me Jack, I know I sound rude for that
But I be damned if they put me in a suit and strapped
I'll make sure the whole West Coast know my name
Ya Boy tatted on his neck, with a 6'1" frame
What's happenin', I thought ya'll was ballin', what happend?
I got the work let's get it crackin'
Grab that Mac 10, and we don't wear guns for fashion
In fact, tell the Mob fuck Rap, I'm back in
And if I had beef with a nigga from back then
We do it like a math problem, subtract him

[Chorus:]
The gangstas and ballas, They Know Me
Them bosses and shot callas, They Know Me
All the broads in the house, They Know Me
They know me, They know me, (They know me)
On the block in the hood, They Know Me
I won't get shot 'cause I'm good, They Know Me
Baby I wish a nigga would, They Know Me
They know me, They know me, (They know me)

[Verse 2:]
They say in the A town I got them stompin' they feet
In New york they say you should have a holiday B
It's nomore real rappers so they gotta play me
I'm a business man, the young Jay-Z
Fuck my myspace friends nigga you should see the streets
They talkin' about me like how gas ain't cheap
I got the whole world askin' when the album drop
You know what I said, the year 2000 Not
'Cause if it ain't the Doc, I ain't signin' on the dot
And 'till then I'm in the hood, flyin' birdies on the spot
On the curb with the rocks, Mossburg or the Glock
(Is the ambulance comin'?) nigga nah that's the cops
My buzz too big, I gotta get it ya'll
See I remind him of Biggie Smalls within the draws
To bring him n Pac back, I would give it all
Hip hop can take me next, nigga I get it all

[Chorus:]
The gangstas and ballas, They Know Me
Them bosses and shot callas, They Know Me
All the broads in the house, They Know Me
They know me, They know me, (They know me)
On the block in the hood, They Know Me
I won't get shot 'cause I'm good, They Know Me
Baby I wish a nigga would, They Know Me
They know me, They know me, (They know me)

[Verse 3:]
Them white boys got my logo on they skateboards
Everyday my birthday, the way I'm gettin' cake boy
The big rims pull up, my momma say Lord
Father bless us, but look out for Ya Boy
Don't worry I got the cross on my chest
And plus I keep it movin' like you-P-S
I'm always showin' off my new B gets
All this dope, ma I'm on like a T. V. Set (Fresh)
Yes, dress to kill it's illegal
The hoes wanna bring me back tivo
And I steal niggas girls like it's legal
So I guess I jack ass like Steve-O
I bought some rims today that cost a Kilo
Rap, money, spit crack like nino
Brown, they know my name around town
You can holla at Ya Boy if ya lookin' for the pounds

[Chorus:]
The gangstas and ballas, They Know Me
Them bosses and shot callas, They Know Me
All the broads in the house, They Know Me
They know me, They know me, (They know me)
On the block in the hood, They Know Me
I won't get shot 'cause I'm good, They Know Me
Baby I wish a nigga would, They Know Me
They know me, They know me, (They know me)
