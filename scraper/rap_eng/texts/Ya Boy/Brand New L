[Hook:Lil Wayne]
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Light a brand new L
Light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Light a brand new L
Light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Light a brand new L
Light a brand new L

I put out the roach and lit a brand new L
And strolled in followed by two females
This watch on my wrist like a new CL
And this Mont Blanc got me with a brand new smell
Swagger of a boss, bitch can't you tell?
I can fit 30 G's in these YSL's
I don't wear Guccis, I wear Cazals
So I can get that 86 D Boy feel
Baby I can tell
That's prostyle gel
Followed by a microwave ponytail
Not only can you not have my cell
But you can't have my fax or my email
Never been to prison, never been to jail
But that doesn't mean that I'm not real
The money that I make on my mixtape sales
You would think I played in the NFL

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Light a brand new L
Light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Light a brand new L
Light a brand new L

[Verse 2: Ya Boy]
I put out the roach and lit a brand new L
Even though I'm already high as hell
Shades on my face, so it's hard to tell
Is that MAC lip gloss or Chanel?
I met baby while eating Taco Bell
I had a number one with the flour soft shell
Her mexican pizza had me under her spell
Next thing you know, I was getting head and tail
Sex is the thing that I do so well
I will bang that pussy like a hammer and nail
I keep a few O's on a brand new scale
Holla at Ya Boy, I got zips for sale
UPS, next day air mail
Keep another on deck in case the first one fails
Never been a snitch, never been a tattletale
And if you're a hater you can burn in hell

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Light a brand new L
Light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Light a brand new L
Light a brand new L

[Verse 3: Ya Boy]
I put out the roach and lit a brand new L
And dipped through sets like my name Hell Rell
Fast and furious, so the car fishtails
Police right there, but I'm like oh well
I'm the shit round here, nigga can't you smell?
I win every time, never took an L
I'm murderin' hip hop, I'm gon' need bail
Rest in peace to Pac, B.I.G., and Big L
Smoke good shit every time I inhale
And spit real shit every time I exhale
The flow like a .38, very special
And my looks make the hoes chirp like a Nextel
The charm on my chain heavy, like a dumbbell
This is how we do it, like Montel
Keep a couple clips and I'm not Pharrell
So you can get touched like the blind, Braille

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Put out the roach, light a brand new L
Light a brand new L
Light a brand new L
