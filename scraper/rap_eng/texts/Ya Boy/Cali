[Chorus: x2]
I represent in... CALI
It's hard to live in... CALI
Hard to survive in... CALI
Cause you could die in... CALI
A lot of sun in cali
I keep a gun in cali
So watch your tounge in... CALI
Cause you'll get done in cali

[Verse 1:]
They call me Ya Boy
I'm representin' Northern... (CALI)
And that's where them young boys is gettin' shot and tallied
I'm from that state of dat brown bag
If you ain't from 'round here, get pound here, play with' 4 pounds here
And young nigga's push work by the pound in... (CALI)
Yeah we get down in cali, leave 'em in the ground in cali
I'm from the state where they slang rock's and hate cop's
Roll the turf, skate block's, never will the case stop
I'm from the state where they crippin' and they bloodin' at
And if they can't find you, they go to where ya cousin at
And ain't no squares here, a lot of playa's here
The chronic shit, we high as the Hemalias here
And nigga's play with' chopper's, a lot of crooked copper's
We call 'em hood rat's, Texas call 'em boppers
Throw up ya finger's, if ya feel the same way
Ya Boy puttin' it down for CALI-FORN-IA
Where you from?

[Chorus: x2]
I represent in... CALI
It's hard to live in... CALI
Hard to survive in... CALI
Cause you could die in... CALI
A lot of sun in cali
I keep a gun in cali
So watch your tounge in... CALI
Cause you'll get done in cali

[Verse 2:]
This here's a shady place, rest in peace Tookie
I guess the Terminator really wasn't just a movie
The dealer's give the yay, the killer's get away
A snitch is very lucky, if he can live another day
The Giant's vs. the Dodger's
The Raider's vs. the 9ner's
Either you small grindin', or you a big timer
We wearin' black tees, gold teeth, and bandanas
We push zip's, fuck model chick's, and tote hammers
We get a lot of dough, like Digiorno
You see them Bentley coupes, We can afford those
Where if you live another day, only the lord know's
Wherever the money at, It's where the whore's go
We call them gold digger's, and it's a lot of those
The feds really bull, they wearing cheap clothes
The state of California, where we don't get along
I'm bringin' you to cali, just listen to the song

[Chorus: x2]
I represent in... CALI
It's hard to live in... CALI
Hard to survive in... CALI
Cause you could die in... CALI
A lot of sun in cali
I keep a gun in cali
So watch your tounge in... CALI
Cause you'll get done in cali

[Verse 3:]
I'm from the Bay, still L.A. love Ya Boy
Ask my nigga Spence, We straight thuggin' boy
I got the street's turned higher then the oven boy
I'm from the west, still look like a southern boy
We on them big wheel's, I'm in that fast drop
Just got the black coupe equipped with the stash spot
Some nigga's ride spinner's, some niggas ride rallies
Just keep ya thang tucked
Because it's... Because it's...

[Chorus:]
It's hard to live in... CALI
I represent in... CALI
Hard to survive in... CALI
Cause you could die in... CALI
A lot of sun in cali
I keep a gun in cali
So watch your tounge in... CALI
Cause you'll get done in cali

I represent in... CALI
It's hard to live in... CALI
Hard to survive in... CALI
Cause you could die in... CALI
A lot of sun in cali
I keep a gun in cali
So watch your tounge in... CALI
Cause you'll get done in cali
