[Hook]
Now baby I can take you to Mars
But I ain't got no gas in the car
You can walk right next door to the bar
You should just be happy just to fuck with a star
Now baby we can go to Brazil
But it'd be cheaper if we sat here and chill
I got a lot of problems and a whole lot of bills
Fuck what ya heard I'm just keeping it real

[Verse 1]
Seemed like yesterday I was in Malibu
Spending bucks and giving and gifts like Santa do
Now they ask me, "Ya Boy, why the attitude?"
I'm broke and I need some dollars bitch, you got a few?
My bitch tell me rap ain't gon' work
I need to give it up and go put on a FedEx shirt
What makes it worse, I'm five thousand a verse
Without having a curse I'm ten, no one trying to spend
So I'm back to my momma house
She gave my room to my sister
Now I'm sleeping on the couch
And they ask what I frown about
Cause I'm the hottest on the west and I'm down and out
Now tell me, remember them diamonds on my wrist?
No more, yesterday I had to pawn that shit
I'm stressin, I got salad with no dressin
Was livin the life now I'm stuck in a recession

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
They just cut off the water in my building
Bathing out of water bottles not a good feeling
No bitch I ain't got no sugar you can borrow
Let me get a candle cause my lights get cut off tomorrow
No food in the refrigerator
Just Kool-Aid and some KFC mashed potatoes
Can somebody call an exterminator?
This cockroach just stole my pack of Now and Laters
Tattoos on the front, back and side of me
Now honestly, what job gon' hire me?
Man, this rap shits fucked up
It seem like everybody having tough luck
Pull out the bicycles put the gas pumps up
The gasoline prices baby that what's up
I need a good meal and I need a hair cut
My pockets inside out nigga and what

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Even chicken is expensive
It's six dollars just to egg a nigga winda
And drive-bys cost too
So they on bicycles doing what they gotta do
Look, my bitch say she want Mr. Chow's
I turned around and looked at her like "Bitch, how?"
I can't even afford to wax your eyebrows
It's hotdogs on the stove girl pipe down
I went from the green leaves to the Black & Milds
And I done went from the iPhones to the burn outs
Polly seeds and corn nuts got me turned out
But anything goes when you in a paper drought
I'm tired of rap niggas talking what they paper 'bout
When they ain't got enough dough to start a bank account
Got money better know that it's a blessing
Let's see how long you can survive this recession
