[Intro]
Every time we wrote a song, it was a hit. You know? It was unbelievable

[Verse 1]
AKHCHIGA, ARA, I'mma get my APEHS
I be counting money, tell them niggas try and stop me
I got the whole hood saying: YB ABRES
Slide threw the block, top down, nigga VONCES
YB the rocker, cigarettes and vodka
Shitting on these niggas oops DE DU KAK ES ARA!
Money we gets a lotta, money you gets nada
YES KYF EM, Louis, Gucci, and Prada
ARI ESDEKH AKHCHI, baby girl I need that
Benz in the fast line, driving with the seat back
Fuck them boys, we strapped, don't make me repeat that
I'm already drunk now, baby where my weed at?
Platinum Motorsport licenses plate on my g wag
I'm a boss nigga, your mad you couldn't be that
California Convict, all my niggas got work
Rappin' ass nigga, we'll catch you at your concert
Off this Armenian potion, slow motion
Cartier frames on my eyes, I'm focused
INCH ES ANOOM, I'm clocking dollars
Stranded on this place called real nigga island

[Hook]
In my Mercedes Benz like, VONCES APE
Counting my Benjamins like, VONCES APE
You know I get it in like, VONCES APE (x3)
Spilling vodka in the club (AYOO)
Pull my Adidas sweats up (AYOO)
Call my Armenian plug, VONCES APE (x3)

[Verse 2]
Complete the transaction, they ain't even see me brah
Blowing OG higher than Armenia
Panamera Porsche with a bad bitch in it
Kim Kardashian look alike, bad send it
Brown Louise bag with a half in it
Black Range Rover with a stash in it
About getting this money, I am passionate
Catch me at the Famous Smoke Shop cash spendin
Stuff the zig-zag to the tip top
Had to ride to Glendale for a pit stop
Police outside and I ain't trying to get popped
Boy I stay on my feet like a flip flop
Polanti jewels on my wristwatch
I'm counting money bitch, TOON AL LARVADS
KEF EM ANOOM, in my bedroom
Move over bitch, I need legroom
Steps the new dot game, that's what I said to them
If he talks dumb, leave him with a head wound
The girls go crazy when dude in town
I'm high as fuck, passed out in a hookah lounge
I see a bad bitch every time I look around
They bumping my shit, heads moving to this song
Heads moving to the song, (haha) ROCKER! HA?

[Hook]
In my Mercedes Benz like, VONCES APE
Counting my Benjamins like, VONCES APE
You know I get it in like, VONCES APE (x3)
Spilling vodka in the club (AYOO)
Pull my Adidas sweats up (AYOO)
Call my Armenian plug, VONCES APE (x3)
