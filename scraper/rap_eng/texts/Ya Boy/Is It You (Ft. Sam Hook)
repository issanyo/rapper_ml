(Verse)
She got all the good qualities
Plus she smoke weed and eat policies
Tom shoes, little tattoos
Rose cover up from a past dude
I don’t know her, I pay attention though
I think her titties fake, no extensions though
Her teeth nice, her feet right
Her attitude never change but the beat might
Her nails did, her ass fat
But I don’t know her name, should I ask that?
I just lit a dutch, should I pass that?
It’s been burning this whole verse, should I ash that?
If she checkin for love should I cash that?
Take it slow on the first date or should I smash that?
So I even want her? Should I even bother?
I know I ain’t the only nigga tryna holler

(Hook)
It was money over bitches
Until I got rich
Now all I’m thinkin
Is who I’m gonna spend this money with?
Is it you? Is it you? Is it you? Is it you?
Is it you? Is it you? Is it you? Is it you?

(Verse)
Hey, pretty lady
Are you comin with me pretty lady?
We could ride through the city, pretty lady
In that 35, doing 50 pretty lady
Channel clutch, yea you stuntin on em
No keys, push the button on em
Molly in her system, now I’m touchin on er
I’m her temptation, David Ruffin on er
Love & other drugs, she a get you hooked
Got her right out them panties, I’m a pussy crook
I was caught in the moment
Smoking back woods while she was performing
Then we laid up til like 3 in the morning
Talkin bout success and how badly she want it
She wanna be a model but she got a diploma
But Hollywood a drug and I wouldn’t condone it
So I fell back
Didn’t want to but I understood
This the type of shit you go through when you out here chasin fame
Tryna get a name, thinkin YSL makeup cover up the pain
Got you runnin round in circles, playin they little games
Now you in the strip club, you’s in a different lane
Now you tryna reach out but it’ll never be the same
Now I’m kinda glad that I never knew your name

(Hook)
It was money over bitches
Until I got rich
Now all I’m thinkin
Is who I’m gonna spend this money with?
Is it you? Is it you? Is it you? Is it you?
Is it you? Is it you? Is it you? Is it you?
