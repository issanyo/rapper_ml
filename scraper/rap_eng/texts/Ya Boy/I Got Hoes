She so fine, shorty she so fine
Shorty she so fine, shorty shorty she so fine
She look good, she look good, she look good, she look good

[Hook - Chamillionaire Rasaq]
I got hoes, I got so many hoes I'ma playa - I-I'ma playa
Callin' on my phone, nah they won't leave me alone I'ma playa - I-I'ma playa
Brown-skin, red-bone, yellow bone I'ma playa - I-I'ma playa
Comin' to my home, they scream and they moan I'ma playa - I-I'ma playa
Repeat 2x

I got so many hoes, they scream and they moan
They see me on that chrome, no they won't leave me alone
They hit me on my celli', I got yella's lookin' gritty
Knock em' down with the KY Jelly, tat my name up on they belly Da-Da-Damn Homie!
I'm slidin' on Parelli's, choppin' the block up like confetti
Candy paint, thick and heavy, got more mack then Makaveli
If she jazzy or she sexy, or spanish or speakin' plenty
Bet she gettin' in my Chevy, turnin' my head into spaghetti
I'm ready, change my telli's, screens on watchin' R.Kelly
Candy paint same color as jelly, cuttin' the block up like machete
Tippin' chans up in my belly, while I'm grindin' gettin' my 'fetti
Deuce-Fours under my Corvetti, swangin' and grippin' the wheel steady
Courvosei' mixed with my Henni', big faces on top of my twenty's
Never had no use for no pennies, all about my dollars and Benji's
Haters lookin' envy, bought my girl Prada and Fendi
Piece and chain cost me bout 10 G's, white-t's and no Pelle Pelle
Diamonds in my Benzeli', I don' hollered at Halle Berry
Knocked her down and popped that cherry
Man-Man, yall boys is scary hold up..hold up baby
