Cuz when I pull up I don't need identification
Make way for the rockstar
Red carpet next to a pop-star
I'm Obama's momma
I'm all about the cheese and the lasagna
Fuck what they say I run the bay
Brought this bitch all the way to L.A
C.L.K. no C.L.S
Some dubz and I'm strapped like a seat-belt bitch
Hatin on me that's female shit
Wrags out my niggas detail shit
Since 2Pac who got that west
You ain't gotta ask you know who next
E-Four-O no more no less
I'm tryin to stay humble but these niggas test [and i'm the best]
[Chorus]
I see they runnin up but they dont really want it with me [they dont really want it with me (2x)]
I run the baddest hit my status they know we be [they know we be, they know we be (2x)]
We some superstars (3x)
They know we be
We some superstars (3x)
They know we be

[E-40]
A soil under stress
Economically depressed
Play a boss ?a fossil? make you open up your chest
I'm from the wild-wild-wild-wild-wild-wild west
Drugs, money, murder, sex
Blocks boomin we ?slam coonin? the best
We love to spoil ourself we such a mess
Gotta hit and put it on her arms and necks
Put this in the bra like a text message
Money call, Jupiter ballin
Speakers knockin, truck throbbin
Generals ?cobbles? on Tennessee's seargants
Diamonds glare, females stare
40 you dat dude, ain't no compare
Diamonds glare, females stare
40 you dat dude, ain't no compare

[Chorus]
I see they runnin up but they dont really want it with me [they dont really want it with me (2x)]

We some superstars (3x)
They know we be
We some superstars (3x)
They know we be

H to the double-O throw that D on it
The track ain't hood unless the track got me on it
Yes sir, it's the best of
The new west so you best of ?westa?
The block ?BB eyes? he plottin on a robbery
Cuz i'm about to steal the red beam you got me
Bring the beat back i'm about to heat that
This is just foreplay baby so let me tease that
See I be the hardest regardless
Beats, food, and i'm about to harvest
I goes harder than yall
Stackin up paper higher than Captain Bacard
What you expect from a dego boss
They go dego hard, or put they go on
So next time you mention Hood's name at all
Make sure i'm big dipper hood superstar
I see they runnin up but they dont really want it with me [they dont really want it with me (2x)]
I run the baddest hit my status they know we be [they know we be, they know we be (2x)]
We some superstars (3x)

[Kurupt]
Diamonds shinin look at my rise
Diamond in the back chandelier inside
Too much floss, gotta play the cards
To make it as the boss
So as I walk in front and spy
Everything stops, the parking lot pops
Mouthes just drop, i am but you're not
They comin in flocks
If some not got yeah I know you spyin
Hatin on the shine, I must still got it
I take me trips out to Covo
?Feel it? on the beach, vanilla colored Diablo
Cuz I'm a superstar, a super-duper-star
When my car pull up to the front of the party
They be like there go Young Gotti

[Chorus]
I see they runnin up but they dont really want it with me [they dont really want it with me (2x)]
I run the baddest hit my status they know we be [they know we be, they know we be (2x)]
We some superstars (3x)
They know we be
We some superstars (3x)
They know we be

[Glasses Malone]
They cameras goin off
Your bucket rollin off
My Bentley rollin in
They say I'm showin off
Man I'm just showin up
Them dueces twirlin round
?Nigga? dipped in butter
It keeps your girl around
You see this Gucci belt
?C-Cuggi? hug my waist
Might fit it on ?promel?
?Come rileys? hug my face
Each day as I appear
Them girl won't leave me alone
This week is Halle Berry
Next week is me alone
