[Intro]
Burn one
Only for the fly. Fly with me, girl
Don't lie

[Chorus]
Smoke something, get high baby, oh my
I’m the flyest nigga, out baby, don’t lie
And when I’m with her, I make that girl feel like she on the pill
Baby that’s how you feel
She said that’s how she feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
Baby, that’s how I feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
Baby that’s how you feel

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I need a bitch to blow Kush with
When she high conversation short like bushwick
I need a long haired diva I could push with
Ladies in the street that still like to get her puss hit
You know the rocket do him, and make ‘em feel good
Call my ex bitch up, just to see if I still could
I told her keep it trill, she told me how she feel
She said I used to get her higher than her light bill
She told me I replaced her with my record deal
I said baby chill you know you sound jealous still
Then we blew an eighth forgot the whole conversation
Navigated it to a spot with no navigation
It’s only one me, she know there's no replacement
I let her mingle with the stars, like we in a spaceship
Nothing's basic, we live a high life
When she in my life, this is what we ride like

[Chorus]
Smoke something, get high baby, oh my
I’m the flyest nigga, out baby, don’t lie
And when I’m with her, I make that girl feel like she on the pill
Baby that’s how you feel
She said that’s how she feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
Baby, that’s how I feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
Baby that’s how you feel

[Verse 2]
I swear she need a nigga with high tolerance
He don’t understand her, that’s what the problem is
All ‘em handbags can’t fix the fact that
Her heart tore and Channel can't patch that
Her Louis addiction is fiction, she got a lot
I swear it’s only one thing she missing
She need a real nigga
That's how she feel nigga, that know how to get her high
And know how to deal with her
I could show you the whole wide world in one day
Then baby we can bang, bang, like gun play
Put you up in the sky
Shorty I’mma keep it trill, and I ain’t running game
I’m telling you how I feel
Blew a few clouds she feel like she on the pill
Get that girl so wet I swear that pussy about to spill
Now momma wearing nothing but her tattoos and heels
I said that’s how you feel, she said that’s how she feel, feel, feel!

[Chorus]
Smoke something, get high baby, oh my
I’m the flyest nigga, out baby, don’t lie
And when I’m with her, I make that girl feel like she on the pill
Baby that’s how you feel
She said that’s how she feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
Baby, that’s how I feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
Baby that’s how you feel
