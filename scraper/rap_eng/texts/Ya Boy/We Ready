Leaders aren't born, they're made
And there made just like anything else through hard work
That's the price we gotta pay to achieve our goal
Let's get it
Last of a dying breed, heart of a lion
All of my soldiers with me, we all right
Ain't no stopping once the red light turn green
I will not lose, I know they heard me
I go hard still fly were the birds be
If he tryna stop me then he gon' need surgery
They can't serve me, waiter or hater
On my way to glory baby I see you later
Ain't nobody promise this
Please check my accomplishments
Better find your niche 'cause you ridin' in the wrong lane
Call me anything besides a king, you callin' me by the wrong name
I'm like LeBron James here and it won't change
See, this is my life, this is not a game
I jam the court if they let me
Ask me if we ready for war, I'ma tell you
We ready, fresh off the block
We ready, coming for the top spot
We ready, that's right, we came to win
I'm going in, I'm going in
We ready, fresh off the block
We ready, coming for the top spot
We ready, that's right, we came to win
I'm going in, I'm going in
I got it done when they said I couldn't do it
I never stopped for bullshit, I kept it moving
This is why I grind like Ali in his prime
I put in the work so this is why I shine
Don't tell me I'm great, I hear that all the time
You just tell a friend and spread the word while I climb
And if I don't get the crown for some reason
I be back to put it down for next season
It's on my soul, I put my heart in it
You say you want it real when I'm so authentic
Y'all won't finish 'cause y'all so timid
Every pass, every play, every yard I been in
We ready, fresh off the block
We ready, coming for the top spot
We ready, that's right, we came to win
I'm going in, I'm going in
We ready, fresh off the block
We ready, coming for the top spot
We ready, that's right, we came to win
I'm going in, I'm going in
Everybody's got a dream, repeat after me
Not right now but on three
One, two, three, say we ready
One, two, three, say we ready
Go for the crown, don't never back down
Every city you hit make it jump down
We run that city, run that city
Say I run this city, I run this city
Follow the leader, I show you how it's done
I never let us down, we remain number one
All the greats before me gave me the stamp
Remember that name, Ya Boy, your true champ
We ready, fresh off the block
We ready, coming for the top spot
We ready, that's right, we came to win
I'm going in, I'm going in
We ready, fresh off the block
We ready, coming for the top spot
We ready, that's right, we came to win
I'm going in, I'm going in
YB, I'm goin' in, it's the lack of fate
That makes people afraid of taking chances
I believe in myself, how 'bout you?
It's not a game, it's more than a game, we ready
