[Verse 1: Ya Boy]
You betta ask around (Chyea!), my niggas packin' pounds

3-57 big enuff to knock back a cow (Brrraatt!)
They claim to be tha best, and I'm askin' how?
Ya Boy done hooked up wit tha virus, call me Westnile (Chyea!)
Call the sirens, shells flyin', hope your vest around
Shots fiiyyed (Ahhh!), leave em paralized from neck to down (Unh!)
I'm talkin' wreckless now, hit tha booth and wreck it down (Yeah!)
Alwais made stacks, instead of crack I'm sellin' records now (Unhh!)
I eat beef like a double deck of checkers burger
I ain't scared to do a murda, im'a weapon squirta
I'll let tha weapon squirt'cha, wet'cha like a f-in surfa
Aye we keep work, hope ya nerds is good lesson learna (Yuh!)
Two niggas, four burnas like a stove top
Aim tha fif' and leave tha sucka stiff like a blow pop
Cock and dump, pop tha trunk, stuff him like stove top
Rolled around fo' two weeks and got tha Range Rove, Haa!
I'm like Moses how dem O's part
Make tha coke go hard on tha back of tha bus, like Rosa Parks (Chyea!)
And duck ki's like Mozart
Tha way fo's spark, ya betta be on tha look out like tha coast guard (Yeah!)
Be quiet, we'll shootcha (Brraatt!)

[Verse 2: Cyssero]
Chyea!
Movin' thru tha hood wit tha choppa on deck (Deck!)
Pounds of dat skunk burryed down in tha trunk (Trunk!)
Red-fitted, white-T, over tha brim
Highly-intoxicated from tha doja and gin
Ridin' like tha rolla-coasta, holdin' toasta wit him
Hollow-point, two 2-3's, loaded in a min
Somethin' used wit wit tha scope so I can focus it in
Hit his head and dissapear, hocus-pokus wit him (Yeah!)
I'm from tha hood where they give rock to go to tha penn'
Tha grave where a lot of em go, but jail is where most of dem been
It's so damn pathetic, I'm coppin' hammer after hammer
Gotta hammer fetish, beef - I'll let tha hammer get it
If you talkin' - I'm sparkin', him and his mayne a get it (Brraatt!)
A head shot, numb his body like a anastetic

Brain stormin' in a 'coupe, smokin' grams of relish
Hardest nigga out, ask - tha fans'll tell ya (Chyea!)
I'm tha shit (Smell It!), even ya gurl can smell it (Hahaha)
I'm mach 5 movin' - I am not human
I'm alreadi been chosen, you can stop choosin'
Yes! I'm tha most cleaverly experienced, line-fo'-line lyricst
Point blank, period!!
Listin when you're hearin' it, mayne im somethin' serius
Full beard, A.K., I move like terrorist
Give you 36 like a square when I'm air-in it
So while you're still breath-in air, you betta cherish it (Chee-Yuh!)
You think you betta then me? I think he hillarious! (Hahaha)
I'ma pittbull off tha leash, capiche? (Yeah!)
Neva broke, I got work I could sell (Uh huh)
And workin' wit dat workin' got me workin' wit skells
Where I'm from, they eitha end up in a hearse or in jail
I spit piff, you could roll this whole verse in a "L"
