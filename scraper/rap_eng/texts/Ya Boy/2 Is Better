(feat. Ya Boy, Natalia Kills)

[Verse 1:]
I like girls that like girls
So they have an open invitation to my world
If you know one, I am open to referrals
So go and tell a girl to tell a girl to tell a girl (girl girl girl)
I like girls that like me
So you and me and her can have a fun menag-a-three
Let's party in the club, in the whip or in the sheets
Doesn't matter how we party, long as I am inbetween

[Hook: x2]
There's something about her, there's something about you
There's something about us, that makes me just want to
So we can have Fun fun fun fun fun
Cause 2 is better than 1

[Verse 2:]
Pink ring on, Hes so pimpin, Louis V on, shes so temptin
When I met her she was like he Different
Just try it girl stop trippin
Turn the club to a bedroom, you and her, we got leg room
Did you hear what I said boo? I want you, and your friend too
We can do all the above, ya'll gonna make a nigga fall in love
BFFs and it's all because, you both use me like a party drug
Now tell me how you want YB, grab her arm and just stay by me
I'll show you how to have some fun, the number 1 rule is 2s better than 1

[Hook: x2]
There's something about her, there's something about you
There's something about us, that makes me just want to
So we can have Fun fun fun fun fun
Cause 2 is better than 1

[Verse 3:]
I see you, you see me, I see her too let's be 3
Don't hate, you can all get some, 2 is better than 1
I know shes down, call her up, roll on thru let's get messed up
Don't hate, you can all get some, 2 is better than 1

[Bridge:]
2 is Better than 1, 2 Is Better than 1

[Hook: x2]
There's something about her, there's something about you
There's something about us, that makes me just want to
So we can have Fun fun fun fun fun
Cause 2 is better than 1
