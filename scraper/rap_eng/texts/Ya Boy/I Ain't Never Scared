[Hook: Nu Jersey Devil]
We running and gunning
We spot them, we pop them
We busting for nothing
We shoot them, we drop them
I ain't never scared
I ain't, I ain't never scared
I ain't never scared
I ain't, I ain't never scared
We running and gunning
We spot them, we pop them
We busting for nothing
We shoot them, we drop them
I ain't never scared
I ain't, I ain't never scared
I ain't never scared
I ain't, I ain't never scared

[Verse 1: Nu Jersey Devil]
They call me devil the capo, well homie fall back
They call me devil the capo, well homie fall back
I'm in the hood, in the streets, shit I'm in the trap
We get it popping my nigga, and I ain't never scared
I'm always on the block, eyes open and prepared
Blow the whistle, and now comes the pistols
The homies will come and get you, them shells flying will hit you
I don't be looking for trouble, but nigga that
Nigga talk breezy imma' split his fitted cap
Homie get rid of that, jail time I'm sick of that
Gotta make this money by any means, I'm sick of rap
And I just started, but my flow is retarded
Cross the path of the devil, homie and get deported
Life styles of the rich and famous
Some die with a name, bitch I die brainless
Look at the stainless, red flag I bang this
Catch you icey in the hood, and I leave you chainless

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ya Boy]
The bay area bully, cocaine handler
All this money and power got me feeling like Montana
And I ain't talking bout' that San Fran scrambler, no
I'm talking bout' Al Pacino on camera, yo
Who the fuck said Ya Boy ain't next
Hey, we can drop a bomb, but Ya Boy ain't flexing, no
See I'm trying to figure hip-hop out
And why they drop a couple albums and then they hip hop out
This the lonely tatted up, kid rocked out
And I done copped so many O's they on a zip-lock drought
Wrap them up, pack them up, make them birds fly south
Where I'm from, you do this or take the cotton route
All these stacks make the True Religion fit kind of snug
That's why I went to size thirty-eight's for thirty-one's
I'm rich and I can never get tired of dirty funds
It's a shame, instead of carrying knowledge we carry guns

[Hook]

[Outro: Nu Jersey Devil]
I mean, I don't know what ya'll niggas thought man. Ain't no bitch in me pussy. This what the fuck we do man. Black Wall Street livelihood

Niggas bleed like guts, so I ain't never shook
We sitting here with the chopper, homie that's a good look
My niggas a chef, he should write a cook book
My niggas a crook, and you can get your shit took
And when I say let them hammers fly baby
Bust and hit the floor cause they shooting, ain't no maybe
And you should watch what you say about a fucking goon
