[Hook] (repeated throughout song)
Lady of darkness
Night of my midnight

[Slug]
She flips through the pages of her fashion magazine
It pulls her out of her reality for a moment
We all need our moments
She forgets for a couple of seconds about the hopeless situation
As the plane seems to take all of her focus
Riding that afternoon plane from Dallas back to Minneapolis
Two and half hours, shes out there
Reading some column about spit verses swallow
Everything reminds her of him
And its not fair

How could she fall on her face for some man-child?
Maybe it's his voice, or maybe it's his damn smile
Maybe its the whole package
From the kiss to the mattress
To the sarcastic jokes, to the social status
Maybe it's none of the above
Maybe she only needed somebody genuine to show her love
It was all about the right place at the right time
And even with the drama they find that
He's still always on her mind

Well, nonetheless then two hours before she lands
To put her feet on the ground and take her man by the hand
And this time around when the laugh starts to sting
She'll just take a breath and dig into that
