[Verse]
Individually wrapped, placed in neat little rows
Becoming a piece, of everything that grows
Some numbers, a name, to indicate you played the game
Came empty handed and left the same
A soul is a soul, and a shell is a shell
The border in between is full of everything you felt
Some cling to a cross because they're tired and lost
They leave it up to the weather to measure the cost
And every time I look within I recognize the darkness
Familiar to the image of the artist
Staring at the bathroom mirror in a stranger's apartment
Can't remember her name, don't remember how I got here
But here I am, thinking about death again
Humbles out the stress, helps the breath get in
I need to check my friends as well as my next of kin
To let them know I love them all to the end
And when the soul begins to reap, I think she'll know me from the sleep
I keep caught in the corner of my bloodshot eyes
And if she has the nerve, to let me dump a couple last words
I'm gonna turn to the earth and scream "Love your life!"
Love your life, quite cliche but I guess that's me
A ball of pop culture with some arms and feet
As discreet as I've tried to keep the drama and cancer
It's no secret I hunger for someone to feed the answers
I never expected a bowl of cherries
I'm just a Virgo trying to find my own version of the Virgin Mary
And when I let them carry me to a cemetery
I wanna be buried with a pocket full of clarity

[Chorus]
Now, how many times must you prove you're an angel
How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream
Before I finally figure out if you're insane or a genius
How many times must you prove you're an angel
How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream
Before I finally figure out if you're insane or a genius

[Verse]
Let no tears to fall from none of y'all
Just remember it all, the beauty as well as the flaws
L-O-V-E L-I-F-E
Here lies Sean, finally free
And as I look across the sea I smile at the sun
While it feeds the weeds the nutrition they need
The people still breathe, the city still bleeds
I'm going to love it to death and keep planting my seeds
I'm going to love it to death and keep an eye on the seeds
I'll be in love till im dead, I keep reaching the seeds
I'll give all I got left just to teach you to read
Love life to the death and keep planting my seeds
And when the soul begins to reap, I think she'll know me from the sleep
I keep caught in the corner of my bloodshot eyes
And if she has the nerve, to let me dump a couple last words
I'm gonna turn to the earth and scream (Love your life)

[Chorus]
Now, how many times must you prove you're an angel
How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream
Before I finally figure out if you're insane or a genius
How many times must you prove you're an angel
How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream
Before I finally figure out if you're insane or a genius

Lovelife, lovelife, lovelife, lovelife
Lovelife, lovelife, lovelife, lovelife
Lovelife, lovelife, lovelife, lovelife
Lovelife, lovelife, lovelife, lovelife

(Outro)
Life, love, stress and setbacks
For those trying to breathe...
