[Chorus]
Oh
I'm taking the early train
I'm making it very plain
I'm taking the easy way out
You know what I'm talking about
I'm taking the early train
I'm making it very plain
I'm taking the easy way out
You know what I'm talking about

[Verse 1]
I've been to places where the rain is welcome
Glad I talked to God 'til the sunshine he'll come
'Cause when it comes and goes as fast as it shown
Where's the man with the horns and the bargain for your soul
I wanna be alone but I don't wanna be alone
It gets to hard trying to be someone else
I don't need nobody's help
Everyone's a hypocrite
They don't really give a shit
Said I need a therapist
But nah

[Pre-Chorus]
They don't give me what I want, no
Once I leave I'm gone
They don't give me what I want so
Once I leave I'm gone
Girl where you going?
Nowhere to go, don't leave just close the door
Girl where you going?
Nowhere to go, don't leave just close the door

[Chorus]
I'm taking the early train
I'm making it very plain
I'm taking the easy way out
You know what I'm talking about
I'm taking the early train
I'm making it very plain
I'm taking the easy way out
You know what I'm talking about

[Verse 2]
This is what I needed like a perfect desolation
Sitting in a corner where my mind is contemplating
I think I'm real everyone is just fake
And don't even know the reason for my stagnation
Trying to find myself said, "I need to be more patient"
Reason for my lateness I catch everyone waiting
Everybody's saying they say, "Life is what you make it"
Right now I feel like I wanna forsake it

[Pre-Chorus]
They don't give me what I want, no
Once I leave I'm gone
They don't give me what I want so
Once I leave I'm gone
Girl where you going?
Nowhere to go, don't leave just shut the
Trouble on my mind, like fine, I don't wanna deal with you
Looking at the devil like, "Can I make a deal wit' you?"

[Chorus]
I'm taking the early train
I'm making it very plain
I'm taking the easy way out
You know what I'm talking about
I'm taking the early train
I'm making it very plain
I'm taking the easy way out
You know what I'm talking about

[Bridge]
Why I start to blink
When I start to break
Why I start to blink
When I start to break
Why I start to blink
When I start to break
Why I start to blink
When I start to break

[Pre-Chorus]
Once I leave I'm gonna be gone
I don't wanna deal with your fucking issues
All this fighting is bringing me down
All I wanted to do is try and love you
You laugh at me like I'm a clown
I don't wanna be here when you around
And all your friends they just pretend
They don't know you like I do
Woohoo

[Chorus]
I'm taking the early train
I'm making it very plain
I'm taking the easy way out
You know what I'm talking about
I'm taking the early train
I'm making it very plain
I'm taking the easy way out
You know what I'm talking about
