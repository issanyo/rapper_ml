[Intro: Slug]
This next one goes out to all the depressed women in the house
Whether you're taking the Prozac, the Xanax or the Paxil
Whatever the hell they put into that capsule
I want y'all to come up to the front of the stage
Grab me a shot of something along the way
Put a smile on the front of your head

[Hook 2x]
Got a thing for them women that don't love themselves
So either loosen up your hair or tighten up your belt
This time, this time is a good time
Good times

[Verse 1: Slug]
You know why she's sitting by the window: she's waiting for her prince to come
And here I am on the opposite side of the room trying to pretend that I'm not that dumb
It goes older, bold, and full of cold, but did I mention that it's well deserved?
No, let's make a mess
No, let's make a baby
No, let's make some hell on earth
Do you mind if I turn out the lights? If I'm going to be alone I'd rather do it in the dark
So I stare at half of a beer, half wishing that the transmission would stay in park
She keeps the music down, so her neighbors don't complain
Keeps the drama up, so she doesn't forget the pain
I keep my momentum inside the reaction
And hide my pride inside of my laughter
It goes

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Slug]
And I'll never forget the day you woke up
To find a whole different world underneath your socks
Forgot to check your pockets before you the checked the cost
Yes ma'am, I saw the sign. No ma'am, I couldn't stop
Drop off, now look who got water on the lawn
Whatever it takes to calm your tongue
If this living room fills with any more faults
I'm going to cut my finger, I'm going to paint these walls
If anybody watched us, they'd probably call the cops
Because it's obvious that neither one of us can adjust
Discussion becomes disgust
If luck was a lady I doubt she would save me from the bumrush
Enough is enough, but how much is too much?
Why am I still just a sheep to your touch?
Why can't I ever fall asleep at dusk?
Why do I need to see everything crushed?
It's a big map girl, it's yours if you ask
If it don't wash up to the shore you won't discover it
Instead, you can hide it in your head with that other shit
And swallow it to chase and follow the suffering
But I'm still smiling, still up to no great
Still trying to relocate
Somewhere I'mma find some work that matters
'Til then all you get is my smirk and my laughter
It goes

[Hook]
