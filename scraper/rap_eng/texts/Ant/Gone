[Verse]
Lately I've been dreamin', Been on the low schemin'
What am I supposed to do?
Tryna make a livin', Tryna make some cents
Said I'm a lyracist, Never need lyric assists
On some real shit, I hate pretenders
I can't deal with it, like "Oh you don't remember?"
These 'real' rappers are bunch of stand-ups, they just bunch of jokes
Misconception - Writting my lethal weapon
Stay focused, ready to shoot
You can catch 'em like a interception
Haven't wrote a verse in about a month or two
Always marked up, don't check on me
Been gettin' so fed up, Why you care, bruh?
Trippin' over me, claimin' your shoes are laced up, huh?
Lustful nights, filled wit' sin
So I'm sorry if I end up talkin' shit
Or spill words make you wanna lick my cockpit
Ain't 'fraid to shoot, don't try to exam me
Cats actin' scandelous, tryna scam me
Yeah, you know if it's one thang: the money never switched us
Been grindin' on my own lane, some fuck niggas switched up
Been sayin, from the start, that this shit is complicated
Just yesterday, performed at a club
Two women wasted, with they ass out
I still gripped the mic, rocked the stage
They was catchin' waves at the low tide
Don't tempt me though, I'll snap like a Kodak
If you got a problem you better get it solved, bitch
My niggas too violent you can get dissolved quick
Apologize for bein' gone for a couple days now
Up for so long, don't plan to come back down
Know you've been callin', voicemail said "where you been at?"

[Hook]
I'm simply askin' "what's really my purpose?"
Written in stone, "Once I'm gone, I hope you all quote this"
