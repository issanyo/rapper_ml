About noonish, I woke up to the music
Blaring outta the clock I inherited from pops
After snooze is hit twice or trice
I climb off of this mattress to go find my life
Where's my wifey at? Wait, that's right
She slept at her sister's, cause we had a fight last night
Looks like one of her cat's got sick
That's either vomit or shit, right next to the fridge
There's no coffee left, just tea, green
Did my best to try to make believe that it was caffeine
After a minute, I had a cold shower
And oh, I was pissed off at no hot water
Hello landlord as I get dressed
Expressed my stress in the message that I left
So when you get a chance, please call me
Gotta go, just found cat shit in the clean laundry
And yesterday's pants is the option
There's already money in the front pocket
No snow yet, but it's still freezing
So I throw on a coat with a hoodie underneath it
Ignore all the bills on the table
Cause I don't love 'em - fuck 'em, who told them I was faithful
Shoes, keys, wallet and my temper
Out the front door into a cold November
Now wait a minute, look who got a parking ticket
I live here, why I need a fucking permit?
I guess underground rap has its perks
Cause all of the sudden the speakers don't wanna work
Stereo is dead, no lights, no features
And hold up, the heater ain't on either
It must be a fuse, at least it starts
I dip to the shop that sells the car parts
And the cashier is like, man I don't know shit
But you ain't gonna treat me like I don't know shit
Bob, that's your job Bob, do your job Bob
Sell me a fuse and point me to the door knob
Installed the fuse and let the heater blow
Music comes on, thermometer is three below
Son's mom calls, I answer it on speaker phone
At same damn time, someone backs into my vehicle
Turn the auto-pilot on man
I just wanted to go to the studio to write a song man
Meltdown now, might as well blank out
Sean'll come back once we pull up to Ant's house
That's the place I bury, all of the weight I carry
Southside basement, that's like my sanctuary
I love life - that's what this one's about
So go ahead and hit record and let the sun come out, now
