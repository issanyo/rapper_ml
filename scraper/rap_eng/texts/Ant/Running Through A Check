Rolling these dice like monopoly

Oh you never really heard about me flow well here go a free sneak peak

I take your life and then elevate it
When the people think about LuCre they really say I think heaven made him
I swear I'm Asian not Caucasian
Was 50 for a show now my prices raising
I'm kicking pimping like FIFA
And verses cleaner than Easter
My life a movie without the film
You can't be balling without the rim
I'm greedy for money and I pray The Lord forgive me for all thy sins
I ain't being fooled by these phoney girls
Even in the summer im sporting Tim's
All the fish in the sea belong to me
And that's the reason why you only catching fins
