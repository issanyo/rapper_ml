[Verse 1]

Heaven's been waiting, while I've been breathing
I finally thought that I passed just to find I was dreaming
And even if things do change
I'll always hate the life that I've made
And when push comes to shove, I'm the one on the ground
Even though the only way to get up is to get down
With the highest folks, thats the story of my life
It's a roller coaster ride and I'm scared of the heights
Even if I tried to be a better man
Dropped my music, and folded my hand
Played life safe, my back against the wall
Well then, I wouldn't be like Slug at all
But that's what you probably want; me to roll over
In the hole that I dug in October
Of '96, yeah I've had enough
Sixteen years on a life, trying to get loved
When jealousy is hate, and that breeds envy
I'd rather have a lot of haters, lot of jerks, lot of enemies
Cause in the end of the day, it all comes around
A lot of fans, lot of friends, lot of smiles and sound
I gotta hurry, while I'm still alive
Because I don't see myself living past 25
That's a good thing, I've got 9 years left
That's 9 years that I want all to myself
But it's funny, that I'm probably wrong
In 10 years, I'm gonna sing this song
And say damn, what a funny dream of mine
Cause the dream is gonna turn into reality
And I wake up, My cell phone's ringing
Garrett telling me just what he's been thinking
I yawn, pick up my mic, and I start singing
Heaven's been waiting, while I'm daydreaming...

[Chorus]

Let me be the last to say
Please don't stay
Let me be the last to say
You won't be okay

[Verse 2]

Heaven's been waiting, while I've been here
I've been living my life trying to run away from fear
What's that old saying? Ignorance is bliss
But I find suicide much more full of this
But in truth, I'll probably never ever leave
Because I'm scared of getting old, more than I'm scared of being me
And I can't hope that I'll always be around
But I will always have hope that you can always hear my sound

[Chorus]

Let me be the last to say
Please don't stay
Let me be the last to say
You won't be okay

Let me be the last to say
Please don't stay
