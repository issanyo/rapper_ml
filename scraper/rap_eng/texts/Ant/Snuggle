[Intro:]

(I’m tired, do you remember back in the days?)

[Verse 1:]

So I’m leaving…stop pulling on me
And please stop screaming
Dreaming
Eventually maybe we can
Make it through a whole weekend
Without the anger steamin’
Strangle that demon
I’ll call you in a couple days
I’ve always been a fan of sunrays and subtle ways
Go find a fuck for your opinions
And by the time you get back I’ll be finished
(And she still continues to grimace)
B-B-Baby I’d be livin’ large if it wasn’t for the cover charge
And I’d be livin’ good if more of them understood
Before you lose it and your words get abusive
Just remember I wouldn’t be shit without my music

[Hook:]
(She was as fresh as April
And when he took her way she wore a smile)

Quit trying to play me to the left like you’re right
Always doing that when we fight
But not tonight
(See, I’ve got a headache)
We can make the bed shake but nothin’s accomplished
‘Cause after sex we’re both unconscious
(And she's still persistent)
Girl, listen, there is no interest in sex
Best that we should finish this discussion in depth
You said that you’re neglected (neglected) and now you’re threatenin’ (threatenin')
To pack your bags and step (and step) to teach me a lesson (lesson)
Well if you’re really lookin’ at the front door
What you trying to front for with the hardcore seduction bit?
Ain’t even listenin’, got it twisted, contorted
Before you stop to notice
(Yo, that’s my heart you’re clutchin’, bitch)
She continues to disrobe, she knows
He’ll shut the fuck up when she’s exposed
As the clothes drop so does the conversation
Again people buckle under the temptation (the temptation)
And the love is always heated after fighting
Thank you, I love you, crazy exciting
(Goodnight)
Hiding the fact that as he lays he weeps
Never woke up because she stabbed him in his sleep
(Snuggle)
