Our time together
Our time apart
It felt so empty
The time is fleeting

I'm on my way to see you
It shouldn't break me
You can escape me
Hello, my name is Ronnie
Haven't been myself lately
Why can't you face me

When you love someone and they don't love you
Don't waste your time
Don't waste my time
And these moments can't replace you
Who can you trust
Look what you've done

You belong to me
Follow me into infinity
Everything just to say everything
If I can't have you then I'm nothing
No matter where I go
I can't just let you go
And now I'm sick into suffering
Suffocatin', think I'm drownin'
They're just in high enough mountain
You belong to me and only me
Follow me into infinity
Lot of faces you [?]
Knowing what I know I shouldn't have fucked with you
Shouldn't have slept with you
Shouldn't have crept with you
Shouldn't never have come inside you
You give it away
You fuck it away
Don't say my name
Burning away

When you love someone and they don't love you
Go to my head
Blood on my head
And goodbye
My name was Ronnie
Laying by myself
And no one else
