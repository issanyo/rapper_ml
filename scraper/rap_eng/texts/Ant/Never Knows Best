[Verse 1]
Damn
In the morning I'm wasted
You I am chasing
You I'm embracing
Right now
In a way I know you
So well it's a shame that we can let go
Right now
I don't know if it's love
What if it is lust?
I long for your touch
Right now
And I never know best
I couldn't care less when your legs wrap around me
Right now
I wonder who you're with
Wonder how you've been
I'm all alone
Right now
Nobody's gonna believe me
When I saw all your secrets and the things you keep hidden
Right now

[Chorus]
I wanna be where I wanna be with you
Right now
I wanna be where I wanna be with you
Right now

[Verse 2]
Yeah and I'm getting impatient
So sick of wasting my time
You don't love me at all
Yeah I want you around me
Want you inside me
I'm loosing my mind
Right now
Yeah I wish you would kill me
Then we could have the time of our lives
Right now
And these drugs taking over
I'm getting closer, closer to you
Right now

[Chorus]
I wanna be where I wanna be with you
Right now
I wanna be where I wanna be with you
Right now

[Bridge]
Meet me after dark
Meet me in my room
I'll meet you at your spot
Right now
Meet me on the beach
Swimming in the sea
Feel the Hennessy
Right now
Meet me in the club
We'll be high on drugs
We don't give a fuck
Right now
Meet me in that place
Between being asleep and awake
Right now

[Chorus]
I wanna be where I wanna be with you
Right now
I wanna be where I wanna be with you
Right now
