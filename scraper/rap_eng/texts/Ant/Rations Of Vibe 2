I got that 90s boom bap in my Nnitendo back
On the regular, mother fuck America I'm tryna get my cheddar up
Coretta with Beretta I'm just protecting my king dome (kingdom)
They don't understand We still warring for freedom (free dome)
Be dumb and you'll see me spewing, All this red rum backwards
So before you disrespect us, Put yo head on
Unless you wanna go head-on collision
With coliseums of dead poets, Yelling Carpe Diem
Die Young and get awarded like Cy Young
I'm the best rapper I'm Dylan Dylan Dylan
And I just fucking begun, I'm lightyears and beyond
Chilling with the Souls like a SÃ©ance
Causing chaos, wait up, Hold ya position
Shots fly at opposition
Demolished the competition
Dumb bitches shut up and listen
Only way to catch it get a mitten
Gary Payton Manning, Throwing bullets with precession
I'm Osirius and wifey Isis
I'm a liger that's a hybrid
I'm cruising this auto pilot
Get fired like Don Imus, For talking shit start a riot
Finger her with Michael Strahan, Nigga I'm a giant
I'm Marcus Gravy to the Soulville Army
That be everywhere from Downtown To Harvey
A clean cut G, get Bruce Bowen to guard me
But I'm sharper than a spur, I made my mark in the Chi
I'm feeling like Steve Kerr
Bumping Murs Hit up Urb, Lets put a track in the air
Me and Marty like whoever the best duo
My dogs going crazy like kojo, We kick flows like Judo
In our dojo with yo ho and Naruto

Send It Up, Middle Fingers Up, We Don't Give A Fuck

My vibrations good enough for Vibe ratings
