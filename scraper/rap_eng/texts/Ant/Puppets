[Tabs]

I used to love rap but I've had it up to here
Just a bunch of queers getting their strings pulled by the puppeteer
Adjust your ears I gotta make something clear
We once in a lifetime, won't hear this for another hundred years
So chug a beer, smoke a spliff and get your mind right
But eventually you clowns gotta come down from the high life
You see the final signs but you're blinded by the limelight
It shines bright but what I write could give the blind sight
Yeah that's what I plan to do
I'll show you how to scan they plans and expand your view
I'll show you how they scam so you can understand the truth
And see the difference between that and the crap that they're handing you
But you clowns are connected to your puppet strings
That's a noose around your neck son, fuck your bling
Hanging off of every word, you ever heard of such a thing
You don't know what to think when the underling becomes the king
That's right, I ain't no follower
You swallow all that cock just to get um to acknowledge ya
The thrill is over cuz our culture went popular
It's filled with cobras and there's vultures on top of ya
And they tell me to loosen up
Fuck this new shit, if this is music then music sucks
Goddamn I can't stand these stupid fucks
Your fake crew would hate yourself too if you was us
But you're not so I gotta tell you what's what
Your stuff sucks and it makes me wanna up chuck
I'ma give it to you raw and uncut
You's a puppet you dumb fuck, that's why you strung out and hung up
They used to have respect from the underground
But what you expect you just a fucking puppet now
You such a clown, I'm glad that you stuck around
Cuz where you gonna hide when chunks in the sky are coming down
Cuz your reality is synthesized
Your life's a fallacy that's how it be when you live a lie
You hide behind the mask so your ass is in disguise
Not even recognized by your own mother, what a big surprise
So one love to the hoochies in the nudie bar
Plastic enhancements on boobies leave you groupies scarred
Walking all around the town like you's a movie star
But your concept of beauty shows how ugly you truly are
And most of the time I don't say much
But it looks like you put on your makeup with a paint brush
You believe the lies that's why your eyes stay shut
Pick the pace up and get away from these fake fucks
Cuz they're just a bunch of hoes
Who do anything for exposure so bend over and touch your toes
You may have fooled the public, I'm like fuck it though
They'll know for certain once I close the curtain on you puppet show

[Hook - Coast]
One time for the puppet fucks hanging from they puppet sticks
Give it up for um let um know you love they shit
Cuz they feed off attention, did I mention
They would sell they fucking souls in about a half a second
So one time for the groupies and the dick riders
Your fake friends posing as some phony insiders
I got your number and I'm keeping it on speed dial
Meanwhile I'm plotting on your death, see how

[Coal Cash]

You better regroup for tryna kill me on the beat loop
Snatch the soul from your chest, you look silly in that meat suit
You keep nukes underground, we got deep roots
Why do you even speak, mothafuckers should keep mute
I've seen puke that can better rep the streets
You must be Mr. Hankey, you're a piece of shit who speaks
Generalize don't surmise who's commercial flow
This was made for you mothafucker, take it personal
Go suck a dick, hope it gets you where you wanna be
You wanna be rich, mothafuckers should switch to comedy
Calmly kept, I bet they let the hunger go
But better hold their breath when they get swept in the undertow
No wonder these puppets have played the planet
Making the Muppet show marionette made mechanics
With the hand up the crap of these clowns, a major fag
Not only are they rappers, now they're brown paper bags
Taking stabs at every one inside the industry
A true artist is something you've never been to me
Intrinsically ordained and disdained
From this reign of bullshit, got a full clip for your brain
So fuck the fame followed by paparazzi
Cuz that shit is twisted like it fitted the Fibonacci
Spiral out, fuck all the idols that you down without
Title bout, 'leave you talking out the side of your mouth'
Suicidal now, try reviving this overdose
But why do I speak you only hear a beat in the comatose
[beat bopping] (I really like the beat)
Can you feel me now, wow how to get through to you
You hear me out, no doubt I guess it's usual
Cubicle music suitable while I'm spitting the beautiful
Usage of truth conveys, serenade the culture's funeral
Too soon to prove from the peace pipe of poetry
Too potent to show it, so I'ma hold it stoically
Openly express everything I hold inside
So I won't be depressed on the day your music dies
Open your eyes, you can see it from a long way
So when your face is fucked, you're just doing what the song say
Fuck her face, fuck fuck her face
Fuck her face, fuck fuck her face
You're fucking fake, taking drugs, turning love to hate
I'll crush the face of a blood sucking snake
I'd love to wait and watch karma make its way back
This is our genre, it's my honor to say that
Payback's a bitch and she got eleven sons
Everyone of them brethren and their vengeance sure to come
So there's more than one monster in the wilderness
Ready to tear shit down before we start rebuilding it

(Hook)

[Tones]

You talking Diddy bop, I'm Hip-Hop I do my thing
You do the Puffy dance when the master pull the string
Tryna climb the Billboard charts but in your heart
There's a ?? part, that remembers when you loved the art
You a wannabe that follows every Pop trend
Will it stop when I pop them or is there not an end
I don't know, how's that ice cream taste
You wouldn't know, it's on the side of your face
We need someone broke the chains, they gay once more
That's an empty 16 so what's the gun for
And who you punks testing, shook like ?? ?? ??
Your life could end in one second for funk flexing
Tell me why all these labels buy a spot on radio
Pay the show, wack to dope ten, the one the ratio
Let's have a vote, who wants to hear that watered down
Now who wants to hear that flavor that water mouths
So give it up for the freestyles from '95
Peace to all the cyphers I see anytime I vibe
Tryna reach the 33rd level of my master flow
Take me back rhyming right after Tabs and Coal
I love the truth, shout to my fam Bad Karma
See fam with mad honor, we got the same grandfather
Fuck all you wannabes and sluts on your knees
I poke her face rocking my poker face honestly
An anomaly, you just a commodity
Puppets for Illuminati, like Masons watching me
Cuz I could easily end your career in a few words
It's not Hip-Hop in a limo with ?? Bloomberg
And I'm always on some disrespectful shit
How dare you try to insult my intelligence
Coming two-faced with no natural elements
I read you and your brain show lack of development
I give you what's inside but you forget the thought
So go back to your mothafucking message board
Talk more shit than I would do in real life
But when you see me on stage you all still like
Don't make a move cuz Tones might notice
All the obnoxious shit he was talking he might show us
So good luck dumbfuck start on the label
The number of sales could be told as part of your fable
I'm banging on the turntable like a fucking drum
You have fantasies, daydreaming of being number one
Whatever that means, I guess you talk in terms of sales
How can you stay fresh when all your words are stale
So grind a third rail and break rare for Ol' Yawk
I remember Hip-Hop when emcees don't talk
It was somebody, kick a beat we wasting time
Now you clones pay by the hour to lay your rhyme

(Hook)
