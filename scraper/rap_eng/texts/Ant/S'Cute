[Intro: ?henom]
And everything was beautiful...
Oh the stars, the stars!
Look at them they're so bright!

Shut the fuck up...

[Verse 1: ?henom]
Here's a cliche rhyme about
Shinin' like diamonds
These Minnesota cats ain't takin' crap no more we shinin'
From Saint Paul, we paintin' the pictures of every landscape
Too cold for thin ice, but we still don't get no damn breaks
So we jam 'til the fans say
Damn these bros are iller now
Still I spill the kill
Cuz I'm filled with the skilled sounds
Who besting me in STP?
(Anyone with a show bruh)
Cuz my rappin's like jackets I'm gettin' zero exposure
They know I flow like the first period
Burstin' with verses
Cursin' combatants
Hurtin' everyone 'til they delirious
My mysterious methods of wreckin' rappers
Like Tekken tag tournaments
Tight as tourniquets
You turned him to a monster
Get this dude a concert
Promise that shit is bonkers
Knockers
Gon' come out when I play another song bruh

[Bridge: James Franken]
You better play another song bruh
It's James Franken
Check it out

[Verse 2: James Franken]
I'm so flattered. I might just run backwards, go back
To one chapter so my lungs'll pack that laughin' gas
Bitch thicker than half and half, add it up subtract the wack
Lookin' back is rather sad, cause when she asked I had to pass
I coulda smashed that ass, matter fact, I woulda smashed that ass
If i didn't make the stupid choices in my shattered past
I'm high up off of ratatat, smoke all my tobacco fast
Plus I think my parents gon' pay half for the Cadillac
I'm more than average with these rhymes skills, but I'm still
A cat stuck in a dog house, actin like I'm fine still
Raps the only thing that keeps my mind still
And fractions are just another factor inside this life deal
I might kill if the time comes...shit I'm crazy enough
...and I do research on how to keep time still
My will: ride or die, still drenched in Iodine
Tryna find a code that I can live or just get hired by
I design these rhymes for only myself...
I'm fine with letting you listen cause it pulleys my health
I'm sick or kids who live consistent focused fully on wealth
But do you, I ain't one to judge, I only bully myself
Damn my standards are high, cause I've been pampered and pried
My fam's drinkin' Pellegrino, while you sip Canada Dry

[Outro: James]
I'm hot
Yeah dude, hahahaha
