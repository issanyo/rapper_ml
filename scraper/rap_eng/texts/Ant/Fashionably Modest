She's a formal princess
From the moment she wakes up to rinse her face
All the way to when she lays to sleep in space
She creeps through life
Energy she uses exclusively to keep all of these people in their place
If only she would understand her
If she understood, how good, or am
Or maybe, find the root of the problem
With a plan, is it plausible ?
Can't be the princess, carries the pride of a deity
Sexy little goddess, fashionably modest
Obviously falsified, honestly doubtless, lotus
Of course I've noticed the imaginary roses made it impossible not to focus
Hopeless, I'll never get my point across that bay
Hopeless, tried and denied at least once a day
I dont need your advice
What I need is some shade to keep the sunlight out of my eyes
