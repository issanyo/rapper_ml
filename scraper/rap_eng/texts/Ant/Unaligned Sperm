[Slug]
Shut your eyes and count to twenty, cuz I'm hidden
Religion made you think that you saw me comin' but you didn't
The jism and I come past
You dumbass kids that be tryin to run past
These tongue lashes
I must be numb cuz I don't feel you
Arise from your sleep and smell the
Burnt brain cells, kid
You felt it hurt, the truth hurts
But no pain is no gain
So cut your cocaine with Rogain
I aim to clench you by your nose hairs
You flinch from the arrogance
I'm takin' care of kids, happily
Rappers be catatonic when I splatter vomit
Verbal yellow chunks, smell the spunk
And catch the lacerations that I castigate
When I notice the mental masquerades
And focus on the masturbation
I'll come dripping fascination
You can ask my sibling Nathan
He knows the Headshots itch from the hatred
I scratch til it flakes, and I scratch til it aches
And I scratch til it breaks like the back
That I dismantled on a Camel Light 100
Now I'm straight dude
And when you're dead I hope somebody digs you up and breaks you
I hate you, and your fake crew
And I'mma bust a fat nut in your embalming fluid
Beyond run through it

[Beyond]
Beyond knows the reasons why you want trouble
That's why I brought Sluggo
Cuz these niggas don't know you're bust to
Us too, unaligned sperms define the terms
That when they involved and the cause
Behind the burns, brothas miscalculated
The demonstrated task, you masqueraded
And activated the wrath of the lyricist
Who indeed will kick it real, I been known
To sit brothas in wheelchairs like sickle cells
So get to Hell, if you think that the man is jokin'
I'll start the motions
Get my spokesman, Sluggo done smoked them
Tt's done, cruisin' units are gettin pummeled
So I clear my thoughts before I buck ya
But just enough to
Tolerate the damage that I'm about to unleash
By makin' my signs and levers connect
And takin' to teeth
B.E. is here to clog shit like cardiac
With rhymes that so thick they
Give your mom a body fat, man

[Hook] [Beyond + Slug]
Yo, you take the head and I'll take the guts
Let these kids know that they can't fuck with the crooked nuts
Nah, you take the head, and I'll take guts
Let these kids know they can't fuck with the crooked nuts

[Slug]
My verbs stop men within they tracks
Words often filter through the wackness
Left off-kilter from all the vocal curb-hoppin'
My rhymes send the unalignment
And I'll leave your spine bent
The time spent dwelling on your wackness
Feeds the frustration
Present state, hesitate to attack
Beyond has got the 'Phere and
Atmosphere's got Beyond's back
A.N.T. and Spawn drag the prey
Today's the start of duck season
But fuck seasonin' I eat emcees plain
My reign hits the mesh-protected steel
I rip flesh hectic cuz I feel
As if the visual effect is worth it
Never nervous when I get approached
By you coach-influenced nuisances
I know your boys have got you boosted, kid
Here's my two bits for any loose slips
I've roosted at my nest
What's next is I inject now manifest
And digest sample gave
Cuz you can't be brave, unaligned sperms
Tryin' to find your scrambled eggs

[Beyond]
See me and Sluggo have the connection
To wreck men cuz we just don't care
That's the attitude we bare
Lyrical skills are developed
Domes are swellin'
Many emcees are enveloped
Because they test us
Beyond strivin' day to day
Within my village
But never touchin' no (ill gins?)
Cuz viruses will kill kids
This body's over
All we doin' is gettin' older
So I can care less
About the year that close ya
Stimulation to me
Is watchin' pornos and readin' novels
Takin' Tylenol sinus shit for my nostrils
I watched you
I know things are safe in my vicinity
Brothas be talkin' mad shit, man
But they ain't into me
Intent to me, steppin' to the mic like you fresh
I hit you all before you even took one breath
There are none left
From the destruction I cause
You're nothin but flaws
Then you wonder why my crew
Is bustin' your jaws
Overrated mainstream rappin' huh
I couldn't read that shit if it was close-captioned

[Hook] [Beyond + Slug]
Ay yo, you take the head and I'll take the guts
Let these kids know that they can't fuck with the crooked nuts
Uh uh, you take the head and I'll take the guts
Let these kids know they can't fuck with the crooked nuts
No, no no, you take the head and I'll take the guts
Let these kids know that they can't fuck with the crooked nuts
Ay yo, you take the head and I'll take the guts
Let these kids know they can't fuck with the crooked nuts

Like What? what?
