[Verse 1: Mat4yo]
Here's the strategy: eat up a piano beat
Show them we the cats that beat these rap's elite fantastically
Charged assault and battery on rad-ish beets and cabbage leaves
It's actually a fact that Ash and Matt are far from baggage free

[Verse 2: Ashtin Larold]
Yo, came from tragedy, down about 2,000 leagues
Me and Captain Nemo practiced drowning beats around seas
Breached surface and the mic was where I had to be
So, naturally, Matt and me collabed, and now we attacking beats

[Verse 3: Mat4yo]
Don't try to battle me unless you have a cavalry
Led by Samus Aran, Captain MacTavish, and Master Chief
We'd withstand the siege, no matter the power your blasters be
Our vocab bring the heat that makes Cortana issue mass retreat

[Verse 4: Ashtin Larold]
What a sad defeat, but you couldn't win
We the deadly duo that defeated Mugen and Jin
We, live in the shadows and we move with the wind
We're like Batman and Robin with a musical spin

[Verse 5: Mat4yo]
I couldn't say it better, got me saying kudos to him
If you're dissing, you must be sipping on fruit juice and gin
Mixed with roofied ingredients, we're the dudes at the peak of this
We're so cool, we're equaling species with Zeus and Prometheus, yo

[Verse 6: Ashtin Larold]
We've reached frequencies unequaled by you feeble kids
We run the streets the way De Niro and Pacino did
Beat you with a meat cleaver, leave you kids with bleeding dicks
MCs feeling that it's easiest to plead the Fifth

[Verse 7: Mat4yo]
See that it's the heat to warm the edge of your seat
And it's better when we create these evil cretin meanings
For the things we speaking, if you think the bush is near the beat, it can't be
Cause that means we beat around it, but we crush it indiscreetly

[Verse 8: Ashtin Larold]
We completely beat these fiends competing weakly
Lyrical athletes, we never cease to eat our Wheaties
Mistreating all you wannabe G-Eazys rocking beanies
We be lyrically deeper than the bleached remains of Pitre

[Hook 1: Mat4yo + Ashtin Larold]
Yo, we're crazy, zanier than Animaniacs
Taking over like when Pinky and the Brain attack
Skedaddle, grab your rattle and your blankie, and go take a nap

[Both]
We the Energizer bunnies draining all you Rayovacs

We'll melt you fellas with a Kelvin-level stealth attack
Spitting Little Debbie packs while you peddle healthy snacks
Ask anyone who's ever felt the hellish wrath
You'll burn in an Ash-Tin if you step on Mat

[Verse 9: Mat4yo]
I'm a man, but at heart, I'm the kid of the hour
Making all the music that you sing in the shower
Bringing the power, spitting written hits by the hour
Growling, plowing through town cause now I live to devour
Fricking kids who wowed at me louder since I killed Bowser
I disemboweled his trousers with fire-flower power
Yes, and now I’m crowned, chowing down on peach chowder
And found at a round table in the highest castle tower

[Verse 10: Ashtin Larold]
Lyrics danker than a pot vendor’s top seller
You white dwarves are not stellar, I’m a lot better
Steamier than a cellar full of hot peppers
My bars hit with the kinetic force of Brock Lesnar
Leaving your skin raw and exposed, and your mind tender
And cut you like the propeller blades in a large blender
I have a mind more devilish than that robot Bender’s
I got a vocab that your feeble minds cannot render

[Verse 11: Mat4yo]
Check it, all of you are cheesier than cracker-snack filling
Coming up short, like you're brachydactyly
It’s Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach killing it
On levels of “the-prize-in-a-Cracker-Jack-thrilling”, we…

[Verse 12: Ashtin Larold]
Stay on the grind, like a 50/50
Got people saying, “Wow!  These kids are pretty nifty!”
And whenever the bass and cymbals hit me
It resonates with every single living cell within me

[Hook 2: Mat4yo + Ashtin Larold]
Yo, we're crazy, zanier than Animaniacs
Taking over like when Pinky and the Brain attack
Skedaddle, grab your rattle and your blankie, and go take a nap

[Both]
We the Energizer bunnies draining all you Rayovacs

We'll melt you fellas with a Kelvin-level stealth attack
Spitting Little Debbie packs while you peddle healthy snacks
Embellished in facts entails a devilish wrath, and that's:
You'll burn in an Ash-Tin if you step on Mat
