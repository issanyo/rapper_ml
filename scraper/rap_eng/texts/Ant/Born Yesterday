[Verse 1]
I've been wishin' I could do more
I've been wishin', I've been wishin', my whole life away
I've been so busy wasting all my mothafuckin' time
On bitches that don't deserve it and never earned it
Dreams burnin' in the furnace carrying the bird
And act out the same play on the stage
I turn around and I've become a different person
I wondered the next day if it was worth it
Yeah, you make me feel worthless
You listen to nobody but your fuckin' self (Self)
And I've been tryna find my purpose
But I be gettin' in my own way
Wondering where all my passion went
That put me here to represent
How the fuck I did all that to my damn self
Gotta stay inspired but the vision gettin' cloudy
When I was [?]

[Chorus]
Feel like I was born yesterday
I feel like I was born yesterday
Feel like I was born yesterday, born yesterday
Feel like I was born yesterday
Feel like I was born yesterday
Feel like I was born yesterday, yeah

[Verse 2]
I bleed like a cracked egg on a tin roof
On a hot summer day, wishing it would rain
Prayin' for those less fortunate
Squirmed by those who have more
I'll never understand (Ooh)
Dry as a snake quiet like an earthquake
Lower the stakes this is a tall order
And the whole world loses soul in the process
Take a few steps back and call that progress
Made a few gains, had so many losses
I don't trust you or her
Or any of your promises
Still have trouble walking with the purpose
Quiet my thoughts 'cause right now they're murderous
School couldn't teach me
My dad couldn't raise me right
Up all night, watchin' 'em fight
Like, whatever, this is normal, right?
It's simpler and easier than riding a bike, life

[Chorus]
Feel like I was born yesterday
I feel like I was born yesterday
Feel like I was born yesterday, born yesterday
Feel like I was born yesterday
Feel like I was born yesterday
I feel like I was born yesterday, yeah

[Verse 3]
I keep havin' a dream, can't seem to wake up from
I remember this shit like it was yesterday
Everything is OK when it is not
This is always how it has been
Except it deviated from the plot
We could spend our lifetime
Thinkin' that we're gettin' somewhere
But we're back where we started
Blessings to the dearly departed, broken-hearted, the discarded
I got all these friends and no one to call
All these [?] don't know how to ball
Sayin': "Party every night"
And we don't wanna get off for the ride
And I was born under a sun
That never rises and never sets
I can't stay and play in your mess
I wanna jump out of the window
'Cause anywhere is better than here, tho'

[Chorus]
Feel like I was born yesterday
I feel like I was born yesterday
Feel like I was born yesterday, born yesterday
Feel like I was born yesterday
Feel like I was born yesterday
I feel like I was born yesterday, yeah (Yesterday)

[Outro]
Sometimes I feel like I'm somebody else (Yeah, baby)
I need somebody around
I ain't nobody (Ooh)
Sometimes I feel like I'm somebody else
I need somebody around
I ain't nobody
Sometimes I feel like I'm somebody else (Ooh)
I need somebody around
I ain't nobody
