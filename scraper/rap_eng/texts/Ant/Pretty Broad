[Intro]
If you will suck my soul, I will lick your funky...nipples!

[Verse 1]
Step off the front porch, let the day come forth
Unsure of how much, but you know you want more
And what you've been gettin' isn't really fittin'
With the images and visions that used to tease the kitten
Fast forward to the present
Waitin' tables in some restaurant for the rent
But the check can't stretch past next week's breadth
It's a prison with invisible walls and cheap cigarettes
God bless the populace, take the untaxed tips
Trade for the firewater, slip through the wax lips
Retreat into a pattern of defeat
With the wake, work, eat, sleep, die, and repeat
This, must, be the other half
Of what was discussed in one of them missed classes
Point it out, circle it, and hit it raw
So it's not misinterpreted
Let's try to keep it pretty broad

[Hook]
Let's try to keep it pretty broad
I gotta keep it pretty broad
Let's try to keep it pretty broad
I need to keep it pretty broad

[Verse 2]
Step out the front yard, always on guard
Thinkin' 'bout what year it was when it got hard
Take it back before the bar fights and cop cars
Take it back before the cocaine and rock stars
When the track fades, you cascade back to the mass grave
Of the overflowing ashtray
You fight love with a light buzz in a nightclub
Like you tryna figure out why your life sucks
Every day feels just like today does
Makeup to cover up the breakups and pay stubs
Your local pub has a happy hour special
Where your daddy power issues can be studied by professionals
It's difficult to listen
When poor decision making dictates your situation's position
Grow a backbone if you chose the path
And go hold your glass up and act like you know the half

[Hook]
Let's try to keep it pretty broad
I gotta keep it pretty broad
Let's try to keep it pretty broad
I need to keep it pretty broad

[Verse 3]
Stepped into traffic, it's the princess with the mask
The last aggressive pacifist
Wavin' a flag that she kept hidden 'cause the nametag is blank if it doesn't say "Victim"
Somebody save the martyr from her self-made spark to take apart her breaking heart
Either show it to the kids or get it away
Throw it off a bridge, let it live on a riverbank
And when it's found, I'ma make her my wife
Everything that I write somehow relates to her life
Every time she's around, my gut says to run
'Cause I can't shake my mind off the butt of her gun
And when she pulls out to aim
It makes me wish that the flower wasn't full-out insane
Dear God, don't let me get started on
Another pretty broad song about another pretty broad

[Hook]
Let's try to keep it pretty broad
I gotta keep it pretty broad
Let's try to keep it pretty broad
I need to keep it pretty broad

[Outro]
My girl goes crazy 'cause she knows how it hurts
(Let's try to keep it pretty broad)
Ask her to save me but go save yourself first
(I gotta keep it pretty broad)
Be so amazing if the chemical's works
(Let's try to keep it pretty broad)
Shows all the ladies that I found me a nurse
(I need to keep it pretty broad)
That girl goes crazy 'cause she knows how it burns
(Let's try to keep it pretty broad)
Ask her to save me but it made myself worse
(I gotta keep it pretty broad)
Be so amazing to abandon the search
(Let's try to keep it pretty broad)
Show all the babies how the world really turns
(I need to keep it pretty broad)
