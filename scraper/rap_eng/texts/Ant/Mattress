Chorus 2X

All your secrets stay safe
All your liars will lay
All your stories are stains
On that mattress

Ain't no way to ignore yourself
A lot to say, no one to tell
We all think that you're so cool cause nobody knows that nobody knows you
Paint brush color up them flaws
Break up send them broken laws
You can't share all the facts with a home made crosshair on your back
Everybody wanna tell the tale
Like the chips might fall but they never fail
You still don't realize, take a look around
Do we seem surprised
So we don't even need to know
About the poor decisions that feed your growth
Nah, we just wanna see the now what
Can you keep a secret, can you keep your mouth shut

Chorus 2X

You can't even tell your mirror
Anyone can seem so sincere
Watch whatever you volunteer
Voices argue all over here
She was pointing at a hand
When she said let's move this ball to the bed
First time on the field hit a homerun
Wash your hands, don't tell no one
Better check yourself
Cause the best part of you the part kept to self
Will never forget how it felt
Look at how well you dealt with the guilt now

Chorus 2X

You gotta secret but everybody does
And the whole damn courtroom wanna be the judge
You don't wanna be distracted
And take our minds off our own malpractice
Everybody talk about their past
Like today's mistake is gonna be the last
We wanna see behind your mask
Like we ain't got our backyard to trash
Well this one drink and drive
And that one there, cheats on his wife
Broken promises, deadbeat dads
Overdoses, and one night stands
Let's all make a mess
And try to project some kind of perfection
And let me sing you a song
Cause I ain't the first thing you ever did wrong
