[Chorus]
I need you like I need Pneumonia
It's always nice in California
I don't need help but I'm not myself
I don't need help but I'm not myself

I need you like I need Pneumonia
It's always nice in California
I don't need help but I'm not myself
I don't need help but I'm not myself

[Verse 1]
I walk in smelling like death
Cigarettes, booze are on my breath
I miss you on, I kiss you on
I try to love again
But I'm sick and paired with the wrong person of purses
You pick your poison, pull a gun
And just aim on the annoying in my head

Cause I be coughin' hackin' drinkin' sinkin' in another weekend
Tell me how you feel
Tell me how you really feel
What did I do to you?
What did I do to be black and blue?
Things are much better on the outside looking in
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
I need you like I need Pneumonia
It's always nice in California
I don't need help but I'm not myself
I don't need help but I'm not myself

I need you like I need Pneumonia
It's always nice in California
I don't need help but I'm not myself
I don't need help but I'm not myself

[Verse 2]
A fly flew in my eyes
Pick me up, cause I can't drive
I try to speak light, but miss strike
It's awesome where to hide
You care for me like I'm a child
I'm always playin' around
Don't let me down
Don't let me drown
In all my sick
I know this stick
My home a mess
I be livin' a squabble
My actions are mean in this
Like washin' clean dishes in dirty water
What do you wanna do
Some are drugs, some are pills
Some are thrills
Nothing helps, nothing soothes me

[Chorus]
I need you like I need Pneumonia
It's always nice in California
I don't need help but I'm not myself
I don't need help but I'm not myself

I need you like I need Pneumonia
It's always nice in California
I don't need help but I'm not myself
I don't need help but I'm not myself

[Bridge]
Baby I'm sad
Like in heavy low
Ready to try
Ready to implode

Maybe I'm sad
Like in heavy low
Ready to try
Maybe I'm sad

Baby I'm sad
Like in heavy low
Ready to try
Ready to implode

Maybe I'm sad
Like in heavy low
Ready to try
Maybe I'm sad
Maybe I'm sad

Don't leave home
Yeah yeah yeah

Livin' must be better on the outside
Livin' must be better on the outside, babe

Thing's I'mma better on the outside babe
Oh oh oh
Yeah yeah

[Outro]
Need you like I need Pneumonia
