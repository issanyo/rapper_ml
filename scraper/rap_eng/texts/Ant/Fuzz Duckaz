(Matt 10:28)

[Verse 1: Stephen the Levite]
What would it be like? American cops chasin’ the Levite
Duckin’ the fuzz strictly because I preach Christ
Yo imagin’ that, church numbers droppin’ like a battle axe
Cats look into the book of Acts can you handle that
Phone taps, old holy raps like a throw back
Quote that, don’t hold back, I need some mo’ of that
Good stuff, brothers hide their Bibles on some hood stuff
Keep the book tucked where the cops won’t look, stuff
It in your bag, in the secret pocket where you hide your stash
Little pocket Testaments next to a magnifyin’ glass
Double “0” seven slash reverend
Agent of salvation, representin’ the kingdom of heaven
Don’t twist it, preachin’ means your life, would you risk it
Or chicken out, like you should be comin’ with a biscuit
You laughin’? don’t laugh when I say it could happen
They already want us silent like Charlie Chapman
They’re bannin’ us, California, NY, Canada
Preachin’ against gay behavior can place you in the slammer
That’s what’s up, this rappin’ stuff, could get tough
Half of us, prayin’ we can back these raps up
Like “prove it, to die is gain right? Try doin’ it
Or better yet, try sufferin’ without losin’ it”
The voice of the martyrs, bold Holy Ghost fire starters
Sheep slaughtered: still more than conquerors

[Hook]
The blood of the saints is the seed of the church
Yo we suffer the reign of the evil and flourish
’Cause the sum of our pain isn’t equal to the hurts
Of the Son who was hanged on the tree and was cursed
Are you shunned by the ranks ’cause your preachin’ His word
Are you dumb when they say what you believe is the worst
Yo we’ve come to awake you from sleepin’ it’s urgent
The comin’ of our Savior is creepin’, you workin’?

[Verse 2: Ant]
There’s a (knock knock) at the door the resta’
The group hidin’ in the back and a little girl is peekin’ through a crack
At her pastor and a man demandin’ bible’s and tracks
The pastor standin’ on faith won’t answer back
And a fist swung lands in face, “now where they at!?”
Screams the man as he searches the place the group stashed
In the back holds hands and reacts by prayin’
For the pastor that he’d stand and the man’s salvation
It’s third location they’ve met within’ the week
Just meet, get in the word takes place in a friends basement
It’s crazy what’s facin’ this congregation of saints
In a nation fillin’ with hate while the governments regulatin’
The church, phones tapped more than a cold shoulder
It hurts to be bold parishioners get attacked
At work you get the sack from employers liberal
Land lords given orders, tolerance has borders
But Christ is the greatest treasure to those peddlin’
The gospel knowin’ the cost and not settlin’
It’s hostile more than a little bit but they look at apostles
Christ’s cross and see that the loss is winnin’ it
Joyous broke fisherman reapin’ heavenly dividends
Givin’ in? Never! Cause nothin’ severs us from His love
We’re His kids while some are duckin’ the fuzz
The faithful will wait and pray while they face it in patience until he comes again!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ackdavis]
Soley out for Christ our position is sacred
Lowly lives of light our position is hated
Holy God insight opposition is taken
So we bomb your flight to forbidden engagements
Phoney brothers and false converts against bond servants committed to stand like fans at long concerts
Conquers sent every nation with the gospel as our reply in the midst of interrogation
Bandits scheming
Police demand the ceasing of preaching
Or your sent in the van to the precinct
Your told that the scriptures you had is indecent
Exposure of the sin that mans into keeping
Next to the local boarders
Through torture the PSB say there protecting the social order
You gotta almost love death to accept this work
Your persecuted and left like your less your worth
They seek to ruin and test you lessons first
It’s PERSCUTION!!!
The fall and the death of the mega-church
WE!
Duck strays from henchmen
Who tuck blades convince that
You should be hanged if you have and unchanged opinion
UNDERGROUND!!!
It’s a subway of christians who move the gospel like it done changed positions
The unsaved are distant
So we labor till death
For this message a one way redemption

[Hook]
