(woman singing)
You can hear the clock inside the ticking and tocking
Repeat 7x (fading out)

(man speaking)
So you see sir, my deck of cards serves me as a bible
An alamanac...and a prayer book
My friends this story is true
I know
I was that soldier

[Verse 1]
I use to know this kid named Jesse
He could get wild on the mic but his lifestyle was sketchy, Always messy
You could catch him on the corner of 19th and 3rd
Until the cops caught him first, with pockets of rocks and herb
But there was once this cat name Ivan, he was the man
Get the digits from your bitch before you could say pussy diving
Driving home drunk from the front one night
He tied his '84 Tempo round a street light
We might
Remember that scary chick Caroline
Very careful when you met her cause you knew she fucked with heroin
Mother of two, no one knew, because the twins stayed with her mom
But when they finally found the bitch still had the twist round her arm
Shit, I can't forget about that big kid Gino
Fucking diesel, do damn near anything for a c-note
His older sister talked his twisted ass
Into killing Steves girl so she could get with Steve faster
Oh yea, speaking of Steves girl, the one that Gino killed
Her name was Phadra, she use to stand on tables down at Deja
Tits and clits and car payments and rent and MCC tuition

[Hook]
And this goes to those of y'all that wanna fuck my girl
Or be down with my crew, or be part of my world
Be leary of what you wish for
Cause its more than rhymes and good times behind this door

[Verse 2]
Ayo, yo-yo-yo-yo yo
I know this kid named Moses
Use to buy all the tapes and say that Headshots was the dopest
When up for raping a chick in a mall parking lot
Now I hope he gets a dick and broomstick in every orifice
Free Love
Thats what Heather use to say
But when I took her up on it, she said that she was gay
Well, wait a minute, why you shake your ass to any cat with a link
Looked me in me eye, smiled and said Free Drinks!
My man Todd had a tight studio up inside his home
And if you had some coke you could come and bless the microphone
Starting selling equipment to fill the pipe
Fuck this life, Todd hung himself with a cord from that mic
Cynthia wanted to travel, drive around the country
Left the city on a journey, came back with a junkie
He use to beat her, if it wasn't physical it was mental
He didn't leave her until she tried to stab him with a pencil
That kid Jay he was a thief, stole bikes and cars
Use to get real high and try to drive to Mars
One night got hot while approaching a road block
Shut his eyes, hit the gas and ran right over a cop
Damn!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Its the blood clot blues, the gun-shot wounds
The needles and spoons, doomed from the womb til the tomb
For whom the bell tolls, this will pay for the toll free calls made
Underage, she said that Jesus gave her AIDS
Now and days the life of fuck follows folks
In my city and some flip their trucks over center meridians
Some do their drugs to float above the stress
And some overdose so they can finally rest
Many walk around like they blind to the mishap
Talk-show gospel, smell the tic-tacs and Simulax
Six pack to make the good and bad balance
Walking tall is a gift and steady breathing is a challenge
Adaption, domesticated bitch to your surroundings
You quit singing along but the ball kept bouncing
Now we keep to self and step over the vermon
Found me sleeping in a pool of my own sweat and urine
I'm determined to find a path so I can leave you all
I miss the rise and I ain't trying to see the fall
So this goes to those that trying to rest in peace
Save me a seat and we'll play chess when I get released

[Hook]

[Outro]
These are people who tried, tried
These are people who tried, tried
These are people who tried, tried
All my friends, they tried..

(man speaking)
So you see sir, my deck of cards serves me as a bible
An alamanac...and a prayer book
My friends this story is true
