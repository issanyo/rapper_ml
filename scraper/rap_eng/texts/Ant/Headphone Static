[Verse: Slug]
Hahaha
Yo, a comedian of your caliber should have an agent
Here's my card, that's my number, give me a call, I get you paid kid
I gave it all I had, it wanted more
Blew up the monitor before somebody had the nuts to feed the carnivore
They acting startled when the shit began to fray around the edges
They hit the resin and chased it with Benson & Hedges
But fuck a contract
Cause what you need is a contact buzz
To free the clutch and compress the TV's fuzz
Let me outta the agreement
Put me in treatment
Cause the picture's uneven
I got a fistful of grievance
Fuck the etcetera, the bullshit rhetoric, whatever, the vendettas
The false endeavors and heed the fucking weather
When I'm simple and plain I cripple the lame
When I adjust the thrust up a notch, I cast a layer of frost
Across your glossy eyed outlook
Never been out shook
By the flossy lies
Metamorphosize by your boastful pride
Greed is dead
Some need to bleed to get that through they head true
Seeks bread, won't read unless they read to
And everything you do has meaning
So add some feeling
When the break hits, let's all flip and grab the ceiling

[Verse 2: Beyond]
I got a hunch I can crunch MCs within the flash of an eyelid
Snap your lumbar and then supply this
Injurous head blow, tryin' to defend against this is useless
Murder candle on their last birthday, my words break, so
Chill with the backtalk, if you slack you get caught
You oughta think about the thought of this:
The jaw-clashing in the midst I saw niggas rappin'
So I snuck up and hit the stuck up
You need to brush up, touch-touch the renegader
Many feel the ?? when one drops the fader
Communicator, I got an Uzi made of paper
Tryin' to do me is major, lose me in Fanastasia
You're artificially takin' part in the art
Tryin' to get with me, throwin' sparks from out your limousine
Continuing to bring the hype, ever-sleezy ya
I knock the teeth of ya, then you go and tell the media
Through the Yamaha monitor, we out of that deaf ??
I fly alone like a commodore, we on a tour so prepare for war
Cause you's about to feel the wrath of the Gen. Woundwart
