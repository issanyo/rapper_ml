It's not about my name in lights
It's only what I feel inside
You've seen my pain, you've seen me fight
It's for this passion of mine

[Verse One: DVS]
Looking at my life I got a clear view
Staring at my future through the CLS rear-view
I know you feel like you're in hell but I'm here too
Coz all I see is diamonds and bare food
They want me gone coz I'm too close
But when I'm gone they want me back coz I'm too ghost
I see a lot of strangeish, but I know how to handle
Many men make a wish so I blow out the candles
Lamborghini dreams, living on the edge of life
I'm up when they sleep, scheming in the dead of night
I hear when they speak, I wish they would get it right
You never said the right shit, you just said it right
They say I'm so sick, don't quit
But fuck the rap I'm feeling fed up of this whole shit
Everybody talking my name on some ho shit
I'm about to lose my head and empty out the whole clip
My head keeps hurtin' and my throats feeling tired
See I inspire millions but I don't feel inspired
Tough talkin' on the net, I can see you’re a liar
Gotta watch every single word I speak on through the wire
Gotta watch every single word I say
Feds watching waiting for me to slip up everyday, I keep up in everyway
They go to sleep pissed knowing their kids feel me
I guess it's just the life of a real G
It’s been a long hard year but I'm still me
They say they want me but this the real me
They can take my life but never turn me into a fake
And I promise to never let these haters turn me to a snake
They all feel pain but I wonder what sort
They say they all ride but I wonder what for
My heart keeps burning and my eyes are sore
I see no bravery in your eyes no more
I see you moving moist when it's peak
I hear no loyalty in your voice when you speak
As times get hard, my head gets harder
I still throw my hand up, one finger 1arda
These niggers all fake, these bitches all faker
Coz niggers stay jealous and these bitches all haters
So many people hate me cah they know so many people love me
So I take myself away from the pain of fuckery
The fellas wanna take a picture, all the ladies lust me
I'm not a star but they struck, well I guess I must be
Fuck the fame and I’ll never let it get to me
But I think all of this death has an effect on me
Shout out to my fake friends who slept on me
And love goes to my real niggers who step for me
Look behind when I'm down I see my true brothers
All the rest of you wankers I see your true colours
I know some real ghosts in the physical
The love I have for you people is unconditional
A lot of man talk crud but they're liars
We just fling them in the boot like spare tyres
So I heard you did a dirt on my peoples
Until you get a headshot call it equals
Let the machines from your own team scream at ya
Your dream chasing, I'm a motherfucking dream catcher
I know you told me that you do this but I see right through you Judas
Brother you're so transparent its foolish
This is just a taste to be prepared for my new shit

[Verse Two: DVS]
I know some angels on this Earth and I know real evil
And I ain't in no kind of gang, I just know real people
Some real brothers, real stories, real honour, real glory
I don't rate nothing till you spray somethin'
They stay frontin' so lay somethin'
I swear these niggas want me gone like pac
But I ain't ever letting go of the mac
Main influence of UK Rap, Brixton, I kept my city on the map
I never put it there first, the 28s did it
We just turned it up notch and brought the papes with it
Brought the cash, brought the bodies and the fame with it
The game use to be fun, now they just fake with it
No more loyalty, no sincerity, this shit was never meant to be
How can you be a top trapper when you tweet ever hour?
Your a fake ass nigga, I'm a real ass rapper
Twitter and Instagram, I got some weird man following me
Plus I got a bag of strange gyal hollering me
No love cause you all say you are friends to me
You follow me but you follow me enemy, you can get undertaken
Do you overstand? And I'm still under obo because I'm over man
I just got back from yard, banana daiquiris
With my nigga Biggz, smoking on mari trees
Spectacular views, spectacular scenes
Spectacular nights and spectacular dreams
But now I'm back in London and it's raining, everybody shotting
Bally'd up, I'm on the same thing, full of energy, rallied up
I'm on a rage ting', so here I am with these notes tryna' change things
So here I am, all these pounds tryna' make change
Keep my head above the ground, tryna' maintain
I need to be free, free I need to be
So you can catch me solo dealing with my misery. Passion
