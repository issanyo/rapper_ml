[Verse 1]
Blue collar Eddy and his better half Dolores
Used to be mantelpieces down at the Black Forest
And I don't know if that bar still exists
But when it did, so did they, a couple bleeding heart kids
Everything volatile, every night Vodka style
Hop a stool, be discrete and just watch a while
But do your best to keep the level observational
Drama is attractive so push it when it takes a pull
And each night's a random, when you've paid a ransom
For the right to sing along with them drinking anthems
And these fools paid so many dues
That everybody stops to salute
But one night after another fight
A couple from an opposite table offered an invite
Dolores didn't want to join 'em, wasn't feeling social
But Eddy was so aggravated that he had to poke holes
He walked over, sat in the dialogue
And called at Dolores like some kind of dog
She can't believe it, she's done, she's had it
But she doesn't want to make another scene in this establishment
She got up and moseyed over
And put her arm up around Eddy's shoulder
Nobody's sober, the song is the same
Sometimes you stick out your chin to catch the rain

[Hook] {X2}
You could be a winner, you could be a loser
Gotta wake up when you hear the rooster
Sometimes it's just too simple to live your life wrong
Gotta do right for you when the time comes

[Verse 2]
The clock keeps drinking, they keep ticking
There's two more people who get to play positions
Samantha and Chuck, not a couple, just roommates
Out having too many shots on a Tuesday
Who knew they'd be tools for the duo?
Put a little bit of fire on the fuel
It's a kind of blue, intentions ain't cruel
But everybody's so ready to bend up the rules
Now there's Chuck staring at Dolores
Eddy is distracted by Samantha so he doesn't notice
And everybody's too fucked up
To even assess the mess, much less care enough
More whiskey, a picture, a premium
Eddy's getting tipsy, he didn't see it coming
On his way back from a visit with that urinal
Tryna straighten out his thoughts and the vertigo
Weaves through, stops when he seen 'em
Picture perfect, it looked just like freedom
Dolores on Chuck's lap kissing him hard
Eddy dipped into the winter, left 'em all at the bar
Sometimes you got to follow what's felt inside
Between the power struggles and selfish pride
No one's allowed to cry unfair
Because now they're both good to drink alone somewhere
