[Intro]
Streetlights shine on and on and on
And long after you're gone

[Verse 1]
I used to know a guy who would keep to himself
Maybe to drown out this surrounding Hell
But he made the best of it in his own little way
He would face the day and refuse to look away
I used to know a guy who would sit alone
All day at school then work and then go home
And repeat the cycle for years at a time
But despite ill-will, he was satisfied
Because he'd smile and greet every person with a warm heart
You couldn't help but grin every time that this kid talked
He was never insincere and never said a harsh word
He held his head behind some glasses and a purple shirt
He'd do a Rubik's Cube in the blink of an eye
We'd mix it up for him and he'd say with a smile
"There's no way to turn it so it can't be solved"
I guess he was right in the way that all things resolve
He would sing in the choir at the top of his lungs
To make sure we knew he's there and to never miss a turn
He'd tell you Happy Birthday whether it was or not
He'd tell you, "It's not much, but it's everything that I got."
This guy didn't care if you were black or white
He didn't care where you spent your nights
In s gutter or a mansion, in a box or a car
In the back roads of the country or a main-street bar
Some would call him a blessing, others even a Saint
He was a good kid at heart, it didn't matter the paint
He was quiet in class and made the greatest of grades
He'd put in all of his effort just to see that he made an A
He didn't have an enemy, he didn't have a rival
Just a heart and a spirit, some cards and a Bible
I think you get the picture and if not, restart the song
Because the kid that I described is now gone

[Hook]
And these streetlights shine on
And on and on and on
And on and on and on
And these streetlights shine on and on and on
And long after you're gone

[Verse 2]
Not a soul saw it coming, how his life would vanish
I wonder if he knew it was his last day on this planet
I wonder if he knew that tomorrow would never happen
If I told him all these things, what would be his reaction
The satisfaction he got from making life a pleasure
Accepting fate's trash and pretending it was treasure
To have it ripped from his hands in the blink of an eye
I don't know why, why man, why did he have to die?
I guess the job was exhausting and it left him kind of weary
And when he cranked up his car, he wasn't thinking very clearly
It was a ways down the road on the way to his house
He was close, so close, to getting back to those he loved most
I guess it happens to all of us when your mind slips a second
But that second is life and death when you make that connection
He slid off the road, came to a stop
Collided with a tree, I guess his engine must have popped
And the blaze continued rising, a cop saw the scene
And arrived just in time before the flames reached the teen
Pulled him out, get him help, it was no good
His heart had stopped its beating and his eyes were shut for good
When I said goodbye that day, I never thought that in a week
That I'd be speaking at his funeral of the things he did for me
An outlook on my life that was previously unseen
You can die in the blink of an eye, so crack and smile and wink
Why do those who do the best in life meet the worst fate?
Why do those who deserve life end up at heave's gates?
Why do those who give the world end up beyond our own?
Why do those who live their lives, they seem to leave the most?
Raise a toast to this kid, I've seen the things he did
I was born to raise Hell, but Heaven raised this kid
So rest in peace man, I hope you're hearing these words
I'm just buying time with pocket change, waiting for rebirth
Joy to the World

I miss you, Poncey

[Outro]
And these streetlights shine on and on and on
And long after you're gone
