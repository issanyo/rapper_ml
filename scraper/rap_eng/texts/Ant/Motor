The only time I close my eyes is when I fall asleep\
I don't blink, I don't even miss my family\
I'm a 24 year old, old man, with the program, set to go man\
Now that's important to me\
New demon women, make your way over\
I don't take care of my self until I'm hung over\
Leave it all behind is a reality of mine\
When my heart burns fire, Preface it is fine\
Medicated, disconnected, allocated\
Misdirected Gampo will die sooner or later\
Up all night, screaming to myself\
Do i need help or is this the bed I sleep in?\
Lost captain, cause action, words turn amenity\
Never will I live my life stuck in parenthesis\
Wanna talk to 'im, a murderer, king pin, arson\
I wanna hear him soft spoken\
Something that i'll never have is something that I want the most\
If I can't pedal i'll coast\
Birds sing congratulations for a good night\
Hold tight, sold out show, I need some peace and quiet\
Ying and bang, no yang, peeps expect the same\
Prof well outside of his frame\
Rich D-bags obey giants\
Force feed mirror images, remain silent\
Tread to get a head\
Who's the best? Yackety yack, cluck, so what?!\
It all makes me wanna throw up\
I need to sit down\

[Hook X2]
Before I lay me down\
I'll have my world burnt down\
I'll have my family drown\
Don't touch my motor\

But every once in-while\
A woman touch me turn me into child\
I can fall asleep for now\[heh]
When it's morning time\
I leave her drown\
I let her piece it out\
Reasons why I'm peacin' out\
To each his own\
I can't relax, I can't sit still\
I can't stay in one spot, I'm not a pin wheel\
Now others dream, I dream, I let em on the boat\
All ABOARD! Hope that we don't sink\
Clean, meal, 2% milk\
Double you, ICs, Pills, my memory includes spilled milk\
A mother, a cop car, a father, a porch in the summer\
Tears and some handcuffs\
Fifteen years later momma tell me pull my pants up\
Damn fuck, can't touch, i have been passed up\
Swimming in the water with my hands up\
I float seven year cycle, then a wave comes\
Its been seven years, i think its about time some one make one\
Brave son made one, earthquake turned tsunami\
I left i shifted the plate probably, and now I'm shifting the stick\
In control i taught myself how to drive that bitch\
I turn when i want, and now im turning away\
From friends from first grade, i leave my family for a maze\
New faces say trust me, they pop up/
They tell me they can help me, like I'm locked up\
But if it's all said and done, before i get what i want\
Let's see if i can burn everything that counts\
