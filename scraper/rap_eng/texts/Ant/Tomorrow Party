[Intro]
Good morning
Good morning
You were asleep
You were in some pain
Walk across the burning sand
Walk through the burning river
Climb the tallest mountain
And when you arrive you'll see a burning bush
The Devil shall appear
And offer you everything you thought you desired
Then he'll laugh and toss it in the fire
Rise high in the burning dawn
See the, red sun

[Chorus]
So today yo who got the yayo?
It's alright and it's okay yo
It's a party who got the molly?
I'm the life of the fucking party
It's tomorrow another party
It's tomorrow another party
It's tomorrow another party
I'm the life of the fucking party

[Post-Chorus]
So break another pi単ata
So break another pi単ata
Say break another pi単ata
So break another pi単ata

[Verse]
Kingdom come, thy will be done
Everyone's in such a rush
They'll be a star and blow up and combust
Want the fancy clothes and fancy cars
Don't know what to do when the placebo wears off
Tear off your skin, dissolve again, then they slink
Then I'll fly

We all want the same thing
Give a fuck about what they think
This my party I could die if I wanted to
Make it rain and hydroplaning
Hide your pain behind that mask
Piss on the wall and call that shit art
Can't for the life when everywhere dark
All this time wasted on
Trying to find something to waste it on
Smiling, can't feel my face no more
Hope you found what you came here for
Said I hope you found what you came here for
We're gonna do it again and again and pray the effects never wear off
Hope the night will never end
Can't find someone to go home with

[Chorus]
It's tomorrow another party
It's tomorrow another party
It's tomorrow another party
It's tomorrow another party
It's tomorrow another party
It's tomorrow another party
It's tomorrow another party
And I'm the life of the fucking party

[Outro]
