[Hook: Slug]
They tell me that I'm not qualified
To lend my voice to something so beautiful

[Verse 1: Slug]
Late night, awake with the stars
Stage fright, you came so far
No more wait it's time to depart
See it on my face, feel it in my heart
Suitcase packed, put it in the car
Took one last look at the yard
Snow's gone, it's never growing back
Rolled on with the windows cracked
No sounds just the breath of the draft
Slow down, don't wreck don't crash
On a road vacant, no one to pass
But I'm so anxious, won't relax
Clear the path these tears I have
Are cause I can't wait to hear you laugh

[Hook: Slug]
They tell me that I'm not qualified
To lend my voice to something so beautiful

[Hook: Slug]
They tell me that I'm not qualified
To lend my voice to something so beautiful

[Verse 2 Slug]:
We only get to live one time
But twice my life stood in some sunshine
I could lose eyesight, I could end up blind
But I drew my design inside the bloodline
Years go by, memories combined
But yall the only reason I would even rewind
Thank you for the branch you grew on this tree
Your first breath wasn't easy to find
So you signified the mountain you climbed
By letting out a warrior's cry
And it sounded like mine
Now everybody hold up the family sign

[Hook: Slug]
They tell me that
I'm not qualified
To lend my voice
To something so beautiful
Beautiful
