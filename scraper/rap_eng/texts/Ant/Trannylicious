Hold that thought...

They make me scream, they make me moan
I’m simply sexy head to toe
Trannylicious what a tease
All my bitches on their knees

My body’s hot, my ice cream’s good
Your boyfriend really wish he could
Your man I had him, think again
Bitch you wanna come up dead

So twinkle twinkle make it bright
You have one wish so make it right
They wanna fuck me, every boy
Yes, I’m their Trannylicious toy

Twinkle twinkle make it bright
They have one wish so make it right
They wanna fuck me, every boy
Yes, I’m their Trannylicious toy

Toy, boy toy

Louis, Gucci, It’s a mess
But bitch, I only rock the best
Blondes are cute, the bottle’s blue
I have to have the latest shoes

My look is hot, my ass is tight
You wish you fucked this every night
No disco stick, no 1, 2, 3
There’s only room for one queen bee

I’mma take you back to Just JB
I’ll make you see it’s only me

J-J-J Just JB, J-J-J Just JB
J-J-J Just JB, J-J-J Just JB

So twinkle twinkle make it bright
You have one wish so make it right
They wanna fuck me, every boy
Yes, I’m their Trannylicious toy

Twinkle twinkle make it bright
They have one wish so make it right
They wanna fuck me, every boy
Yes, I’m their Trannylicious toy

(Introducing Ant)

It’s Johnny Boy, he’s back again
To number one, you’ll find a trend
No Britney Spears, no Lady GaGa
And no more classic, old Madonna

His music’s hot, we’re grinding slow
You hear this song to make it flow
They may be queens, but this one’s top
Trannylicious, make it pop

(Introducing Ashton Zanecki)

This beat is so hot
I produced it make it rock
Polka dot cause I’m from Poland
Ooh la la, French bitch rollin’

I get the girls rollin’ feisty
Johnny Boy might call it hyphy
Peace out, my time is up
She’s Trannylicious (Ohh...)
