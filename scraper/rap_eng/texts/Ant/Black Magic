[Intro: LUKIFER, Ant]
"Yo Anthony" "Sup Luke"
"Tell me why the fuck(x2) do these retards really think I'm evil or some shit dawg"
"I don’t know these people got no sense of humor dawg"
"I mean listen if I'mma be accused of this shit I might as well fucking do it"
"Yea-wait no Lu-" "nah nah" "nah Luke hold up"
"nah you motherfuckers did this to yourself" "ah shit"
"Yeah you damn right ah shit"
"bout to kill these motherfuckers"

[Verse 1: LUKIFER]
Y'all gonna let me talk my shit
Someone needs to break the ice so I’mma get the ice pick
Now watch how I spit about violence which I admit is kinda sick
And twisted
Shit I'm bout to stab you motherfuckers with this ice pick
Why cause I like it better watch out I might get my sidekick
SATAN
Bitch I'm LUKIFER the dark side of Luke that you prefer
A true sinner killed Lucifer who suffocated made him choke
Cause fuck the Jedi way bitch I dead it my way shit
By the way I'm gassed up I'm feeling like pulling a Richard Rojas
Take PCP then give out toe tags
And if they start blaming me claim insanity
You better cross examine me or my demons will pass along to you LUKIFER been demonic since the chronic
To some I'm a genius but to others I'm a fetus who shouldn't have made it
I’m confused and I’m always hated
And I'm so ticked ticked ticked I’mma bomb bout to sound off
Let these lyrical rounds off I got more ammunition then a magazine store
Gloves are off and it's time for war swore I took exit 13 but it seems I'm still a lunatic on route 666

[Verse 2: Ant]
I'm like drip splash I got the black magic
And them man they can’t win
We spit bars it's demanded
Y'all gonna tell me how much times I gotta go and kill a beat
Before I get respect cause I'm up next
Give it some time you'll see flawless victory bitches calling flip the screen
Flip the switch I smoke rappers like addictive nicotine
But where's Nikki this ain't Logic
Are you with me cause I got it
Got some 50's in my pockets got the profits and I'll cop it
Got that black magic in my veins other rappers MIA
Cop yo shit off lay away blaze I can but I'm unphased
Pulling like i'm scorpion rapping till it's 3010
Cruising like it's skate on grand get fucked up like Dirty Dan

*WAIT* *Finger Snap*

[Verse 3: LUKIFER]
And 2002 is when this worlds curse began
Luke came outta the womb in a hurry damn
I came to take your pen and paper from your hand
And enhance it
Using black magic
To improve the bandwidth
Cause this game has been losing it's connection
From where it originally started
Right now it's acting retarded
I mean the whole games changed it's literally a spitting game
With how much you on slur on your mic
They say "peace and love man your drawn towards fights"
I may have an obsession with aggression
But you have an obsession with fake depression
More than half of you act
You misuse this troubled youth for views and streams
Your whole career you've deceived kids to receive hits
You motherfuckers better believe this
I'm coming to bring rap back don't try to stop me
I'm not one you fucking should play with
I'm the motherfucking definition of insaneness
This is not no game bitch
For now on everytime somethings on my mind I'mma motherfucking say it
