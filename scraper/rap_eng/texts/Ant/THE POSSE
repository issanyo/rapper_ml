[Intro]
Well here comes a brother I know for sure can rap

[Verse 1: The Grouch]
Man on a wire, red string on his wrist
Remind him of his goals, he ain't gonna miss
Too much opportunity to trip on bullshit
Lift his vibration, sharp as tools get
Shark tooth around his neck for protection
Thick skin from all the fire that he's stepped in
He's got something in common with shaman
Raised by wolves, spirits, gods, and goddesses
Appears on trips and odysseys
Elevated ways yet dips so modestly
Not confined by the body
Astroprojections next to study
Reflections resemble but none match perfectly
No exceptions, n-o certainly not
Walks calm amidst the urgency
Sacred herbs with words like surgery
He purged, rid himself of absurdities
The nerve of those to throw stones at him
Arose, explodes, and grows again
Ahead of his aura, shields every limb

[Hook x2: The Grouch]
Angels, guardians, ghosts, and saints
All play a part of this closened range
Holy men, prophets, healers, and kings
That's my entourage man, the posse I bring

[Verse 2: The Grouch]
Vibrating at the highest frequency of the bunch
Every soul shall adapt to match that at once
Old, how we channel, high mammal, no dunce
Cap who, it fits, do with this, what he wants
Merlin style, curling like, like prisms
Past lifetime, regression, new mission
No obsession, no resting, true destined
We blew breath in where death laid its weapon
Arise, call on Master Build-the-skies
Open up, planets aligned at the will of the wise
Voluntary compliance, allegiance with the science
Walk with lions, be in tune with Orion
They scared of crying or whiling out
His pick is just a decoy, can't iron it out
Stuck, well fuck, he'll design a new route
Dance water from the heavens, first sign of a drought
Cut from cloth, marked proof and unbought
Armor untarnished, honor it all
Arose, explodes, and grows again
Ahead of his aura, shields every limb

[Hook x2: The Grouch]
Angels, guardians, ghosts, and saints
All play a part of this closened range
Holy men, prophets, healers, and kings
That's my entourage man, the posse I bring

[Verse 3: The Grouch]
And all of us, rare like elephant tusks
Purple dragon hearts in our elements, trust
I sprinkle a man, to raise the mass up
If I came by myself, well then that's just enough
It banks, when you could really learn some stuff
If we could exchange, then we furthered each other
Well that's just the opposite of murder, my brother
When we're on the same squad, life is less hard
I changed my thinking to large
When they try to attack, I just call in the guard
Arose, explodes, and grows again
Ahead of his aura, shields every limb

[Hook x4: The Grouch]
Angels, guardians, ghosts, and saints
All play a part of this closened range
Holy men, prophets, healers, and kings
That's my entourage man, the posse I bring
