And a one and a two and a three and a four and
Who's that cat sitting in the back corner with his face buried in his notebook
Who's that kid who can use one hand to count every meal this month that was home cooked
As ugly as i am how is it that i manage to avoid sleeping in my own bed
Twenty-nine years old brain works like a motor so the diagnoses is bone dead

And he used to climb tree's and throw snow balls it was never a chore to endure
Don't know who's voice that it was that I heard but it told me to go search for a cure
So now I move with the ease of the breeze in the race to cross last place
Who's that cat sitting in the back corner with his heart laying in an ash tray

On the go where I go only god knows
Maybe I can see if I got rid of these obstacles, wiping down the residue with a paper towel
Screamin at the world from a stage tryin to wake the crowd
Make it loud, turn it up and drop off, shed a tear for every single sock that got lost
I gotta stop watch that tells a lot of lies, finish your drink first, and than we got apotheosized
Creepiest belief's smashed them with an ax on a quest to figure out the best route to relax
Went on a vacation, move over I'm back now, better believe the chief how quickly he sat down
And in the background, the soundtrack was caution
Woke up found himself lost in Texas, called the thirty-five up in the tele and meet me god
Don't even know what to tell me, so tell me?

Who's that cat sittin in the back corner with his face buried in a girlfriend
Who's that kid who wants to use one hand to count the days left until this world ends
As ugly as I am how is it that I manage to avoid sleeping in my own bed
Twenty-nine years old brain works like at motor so the diagnoses is bone dead

And he used to ride a bike down the street with a boombox strapped to the back of the seat
Don't know who's voice I ignored I don't care anymore I'd rather stare at my feet
So as I move with the ease of the breeze in the race to cross last place
Who's that cat sittin in the back corner, with his heart laying in an ash tray

She asks where iv been, I says iv been nowhere, no fare
She can read my mind, don't even go there, I gotta cold stare I pull out for such occasions
Focus on the path, when I have no destination
Respiration, need to keep the breath steady, desperation, tryin to read the benefits of Betty
Test my patience, yes in DDR automatic, exclamation point valid, drama addict
I got a bad case of the goods, I spent a lot of fucking time in these woods
I guarantee I would change your life, if I could but could not, your having a hard enough time trying to be understood
Stompin in my boots and my blind fold, what iv given do back to me nine fold
Times are cold, and all of my rhymes are old, but I'm binded by my soul to make something they could hold

Who's that cat sittin in the back corner with his face buried in his notebook
Who's that kid that can use one hand, to count every meal this month that was home cooked
As ugly as I am, how is that I manage to avoid sleeping in my own bed
Twenty-nine years old, brain works like a motor, so the diagnoses is bone dead
And he used to climb trees and throw snowballs, it was never a chore to endure
Don't no who's voice, that it was that I heard, but it told me to go search for a cure
