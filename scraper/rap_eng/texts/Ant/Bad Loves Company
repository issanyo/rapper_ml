[Intro]
What am I looking for? In a tavern darker than a cavern
Why does it never stop?
All the screams and cries from high up on the rooftop
Welcome another day, it's the same I'm afraid I'm going insane
You were the only one that I see, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I had a dream, that you were mine
It was some time in July
Had a dream that you were mine
It was some time in July
Had a dream that you were mine
It was some time in July
Had a dream that you were mine
I'll be right back

[Verse]
Now put the bad mouth on me, run from me
I'll be sitting on a stoop watching the world go by
And I'm halfway finished with my life sentence
Not looking for repentence, just looking for some escapism
12 o'clock in this realm where everybody at?
Everybody half dead?
I ask as my soul lead my body and body is hollow
Middle fingers up, don't give a fuck about living for tomorrow
I love it when the drums sound like that
With the boom bap, blew off your dude's cap
Makes me sad to think that all my life
I been made to think that I am less than a person
I been looking like Scarface around my block
Searching for my pops under the rocks
With the popsicle stick hanging outta' my mouth
Stuck in the mud so much I stopped giving a fuck
So what, so what

[Post-Chorus]
All my life
All my life I've been sorry
All my life
All my life I've been sorry
All my life (All my life)
All my life I've been sorry
All my life (All my life)
All my life I've been sorry

[Chorus]
I had a dream, that you were mine
It was some time in July
Had a dream that you were mine
It was some time in July
Had a dream that you were mine
It was some time in July
Had a dream that you were mine
I'll be right back

[Verse]
So come and meet me in the bar
Let's get happy in the church
Living parallel to Hell
No breath left to expel
Exhale sometime I feel like none of this is real
Often, often lay me in hardship coffins, yo
Where do I go and where do I turn?
It's looking like a dead end
This ain't no fairy tale no happy ending
Or beginning I keep on sinning
The devil on my shoulder keep grinnin'
Yo it's been a minute
Since I found peace, my eyes will never find peace
Blow my prayers to the streets just to bless my feet
Yeah I walk in heat, 93 degree weather
God we blessed just to have a breeze we leave in the knees

[Outro]
So pull up a seat, pour you a drink, and stick around
(Look at what we found, bad luck's company)
So pull up a seat, pour you a drink, and stick around
(Look at what we found, bad luck's company)

[Chorus]
I had a dream, that you were mine
It was some time in July
Had a dream that you were mine
It was some time in July
Had a dream that you were mine
It was some time in July
Had a dream that you were mine
I'll be right back
