[Verse 1: JOKER]
If I were ticking time bomb, would you cut the red wire
Like a young boy standing in a fire
As the flames climb higher
He sings and his voice is a pitch higher
Reminiscent of the days as a kid when he tried to fight her
But it was no use
This woman was high and mighty
But still he held his balloon sword and stood there in his tighty whities
He was too young to handle them fucking with his psyche
Constantly feeling fight or flighty
The butterflies under his belly flutter with ease
He's looking forward to the day he gets ahold of some keys
So he can push the pedal down to the carpeted floor
And drive away from the problems he endures
But to this young boy that's an eternity away
Getting played by his so called friends almost every day
The little boy used to smile, but it hardened into a frown
Hopefully someday he can find a way to turn it around

[Hook]
He was just a little boy with a spectacular dream
A little boy who didn't want to be picked last for the team
A little boy who was cut differently at the seams
A little boy who's mind was up high with the trees
A little kid mixed with Latino and white
Who did his best to keep his head up through his everyday fight
But it was hard knowing he was the one nobody liked
So he'd go home after school and just write

[Verse 2]
It was like an escape
A way off of the plate
He'd take the apple out his mouth, hoping his captors don't wake
He'd take the crap out of his mind and smear it all on the page
Just like a pimply teen, they would pick on his face
And his asthma started getting worse, he started coughing loud
They prescribed corticosteroids to try to help him out
They take time to work, he would have to wait
Time passed and the only thing changing was his weight
The steroids filled his body and his face puffed up
And soon he was a balloon that didn't float because it weighed too much
And everyday became a struggle just to get up and step into that classroom with students that never let up
They hate you for the videos you post and push you to the granite
Angry that you act like you're the coolest person on the planet
But shit he didn't plan it
He didn't even remotely feel the words he was writing in his iPhone notes
But still he wrote like he was happy and cocky and full of life but in reality he wanted to get off of that boat
He understood that he was heavy, he accepted death
And when he jumped into the frigid salt water, he felt himself sinking to the darkest of depths
He reached up for the branches of the trees he knew so well but couldn't grab hold and knew he would die if he didn't get help
It was hard for him but he threw away his pride and accepted that he needed help in his life
And when he grabbed hold of that person that showed they actually cared, he was no longer alone in his fight
And he could get back to the trees and take flight

[Hook]
He was a little boy that would never give up on his dreams
Who didn't care if other people chose him last for the team
Who accepted that he was differently cut at the seams
Who's mind was up high at the tops of the trees
That little monkey boy climbing branches up in the sky
Who no longer feels the need to continue to hide what he's become

[Bridge]
He used to go and hide in the leaves
But now he stands high, proud to be the boy in a tree
The boy in a tree
