[Chorus]
Gratitude can't get you nowhere
Now my love is going away, going away
I got an attitude like you ain't seen yeah
Now my love is going away, going away
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I try to be like somebody (Whoo)
I already was (Uh)
And I don't give a fuck (Whoo uh)
I just wanted them to like me
For who I am
I don't give a damn

[Verse]
Now I said my love is gone
I don't know how I'll carry on
I know I've made mistakes
Well I don't really owe 'em praise
Bricks to loose and can full of gasoline
Cigarettes and Dramamine
Feels like my soul is black
On this road and I won't look back

[Chorus]
Gratitude can't get you nowhere
Now my love is going away, going away
I got an attitude like you ain't seen yeah
Now my love is going away, going away

[Post-Chorus]
I try to be like somebody
I already was
And I dont give a fuck (Whoo)
I just wanted them to like me
For who I am
I just need a friend

[Verse]
Made my bed
And now I lay
Outside is where I used to play
Nobody comes around
When I'm feeling down
And no one knows how long it takes
For someone's will to break
But what I know for sure
There's something more than this place
I'm on my way home
Back to you
Hate to win
But I love to lose
I don't need a friend
All alone is where I been
Your love is shallow
One loves their shadow
Kiss of death
Loss of breathe
You were here and then you left

[Chorus]
Gratitude it used to be here
Now my love is going away, going away (Yeah)
I got an attitude like you ain't seen yeah
Now my love is going away, going away
