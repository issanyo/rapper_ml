[Verse 1]
So what you’re saying, I hear complaining
I could repeat every statement you’ve made verbatim
I treated you better back in the day, and
Now you’re feeling like I’m changing like I’m not the same man!
I used to force your heartrate to run a race
And now it’s safe to say it’s be running out of patience!
Frustration, you want some separation
You want no placement within this mess I’m making
I’m painfully aware of my mistakes and
Maybe you should break and escape from this situation
Or take a little taste of the blame and
Instead you full of hate
Telling me get out your face, yeah

[Chorus:]
You don’t really want, you don’t really want me
You don’t really want, you don’t really want me to go!
No, you don’t, that’s just for show!
You don’t really want, you don’t really want me
You don’t really want, you don’t really want me to go!
No, you don’t, that’s just for show!

[Verse 2]
Now you wanna threaten me, is that what you’re telling me
Like if I don't step it up, what you're gon' step for me?
Where you gonna go, you’re next to me steadily
At this point is like I’m joint with your chemistry
Yes, that it just wasn’t meant to be our destiny
Is upsetting, see I gave you the best of me!
All my friends are like just let her leave
Uh, so go ahead and pretend that I set you free!
What!

[Chorus:]
You don’t really want, you don’t really want me
You don’t really want, you don’t really want me to go!
No, you don’t, that’s just for show!
You don’t really want, you don’t really want me
You don’t really want, you don’t really want me to go!
No, you don’t, that’s just for show!

[Verse 3]
All right, all ready now!
You make this headache pound
I ain’t trying to mess around
You ain’t allowed to get me down!
It's no sweat at all
No, I won’t stress about
Anything projected out of your passive aggressive mouth!
Let it out! If we’re walking on a separate ground
Go ahead and step off, with all of those brand new friends you’ve found!
Hit the town, you’ll be back for a second round
If you was gonna leave me
You would have already left me now!

[Chorus:]
You don’t really want, you don’t really want me
You don’t really want, you don’t really want me to go!
No, you don’t, that’s just for show!
You don’t really want, you don’t really want me
You don’t really want, you don’t really want me to go!
No, you don’t, that’s just for show!
