[Verse 1]
She locked herself in that room with a, full view of a, full moon
And this where she come to fly, when she wanna disappear from what's outside
I try not to make it obvious, she doesn't know there's an audience
These walls are ribbon thin so it ain't my fault that I'm listenin'
And I can make out every word cause she, sing loud like a, trapped bird
She looks out at the stars when she, write songs on that guitar

[Hook]
And every song you write without me, just another sad song to me
And every song you write without me, sound like who I'll never be

[Verse 2]
She picked up her instrument and I, don't know where I went I just
Close my eyes and flow like I'm in there with her tryna hold all the note she hits
Motionless, my secret solo show she gives. Sometimes she'll search for a line and I
Wish I could give her one of mine, but it would all unravel if she, found out I was in the shadow so I
Suppress what I, obssess, but your biggest fan wanna sing a duet

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Familiar with the voice of the lonely, lost in the noise of the wind blowing
Go ahead girl tell your story but, the siren don't wail for holy
Play your heart by strings with the parts you sing, can't wait to hear what tomorrow brings
And if you ever get to smile I'll be, right here tryna reconcile my, desire to admire your sadness
You gon rise from the fire in ashes. And if it's all the same to you, you ought ta let me be the one that helped change your tune

[Hook]
