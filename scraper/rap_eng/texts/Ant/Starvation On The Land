Yeah, yeah
Starvation on the land, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Help them to understand

Sleeping children in the back got nowhere to go
In the wee hours of the dark
Next day you see them at the bus stop
Not going to school;
That makes no sense, fighting for your rights

Yeah, yeah
Starvation on the land
Yeah, little children
Little children, take your stand
Yeah, yeah, the book of the Prophecies, yeah
A little child
A little child shall lead the Way, yeah

You get your examples even in the sun
It's not everything Your eyes can see
Some things are not good to eat
To put in your mouth that's sweet
Putting to the belly
Putting to the belly, putting to the belly

Yeah, yeah
Starvation on the land
Yeah,  everyone I'm asking must got to pay Someone
So beware of all you by yourself
Watch your steps
You soon might ended up

Don't let Satan use You far from the street
Right now when I check it, I know the street
But neither the fire's not silent to Me
You get your examples even in the sun
It's not everything Your eyes can see
