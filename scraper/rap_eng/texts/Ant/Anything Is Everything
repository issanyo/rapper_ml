[Intro]
Cat don't be tripping
Because that's the way you wanted it
That's the way you got it
That's the way it's gonna be
That's just the way it is

[Verse One: Mr. Gene Poole]
Word is bond
When shots get fired I'm the first to respond
And if niggas don't correspond, to the same logical shit I'm on
They get dragged from Queens to Lafond to Haggard back to Plymouth
See that rapper?
Him a myth, soon as he opens his mouth, gimmick
Let's chop him up
Place him in the frozen section at Symick's
So when someone sees part of his face
When they shopping they can go cynic
I bring heart up in the place to keep shit popping, ain't no limits
Plus I swing from the start in this race, I'll beat you to the finish
I drove to Venice, L.A., San Francisco and back to Chicago
Ask about if niggas don't give me shit where ever I go
You can not throw blows at my direction without me flexing
So either shoot me
Or hit me with your Lexus at the intersection

[Verse Two: I Self Devine]
Offense Defense Pretense
Picture holy scriptures travel brochures The Cuban Connect'
Plus New York to your research to knowledge evident without being there
I told the devil I was the master black he disappeared
Existence do get twisted by the view of visualizing
Brain tumor penetrating your mental state and sooner then
Man woman and child collapse back providing time gaps
Creation was partaken
Leaving your soul shaken

[Hook]
Everything is Everything Yeaaaax3

[Verse Three: Musab]
A fist full of quarters leads to disqualification
But a fist full of dollars be the shit that's running the nation
My name has been connect with the underground heads
The movements and the unknown rebels that dwell there
And up stairs we got brothers on the Play Station
Destruction Derby 2 is cool but I prefer the Raiden
When the beat's bass hit and the vibe is created
I stick it into brothers as the liquid leave them sedated
What the fuck you saying? Man you trying to intercept
Better stamp on your check by the brothers up in the stands
Pass through the jungle and come dwell amongst the tribe
Enter the ciph' and get to meet General Woundwart live

[Verse Four: Slug]
I discovered ill recipes without the ride on Ecstasy
Fantasizing I'd have three wives sleeping next to me
Eventually, organize the equity
Get the homestead steady
Credit to trust in me, some partial child custody
It beckons me
Keeps testing me
I strangle the jeopardy driven snakes that bathe in the leprosy
Heavily weighed in
Dumbfounded by the destiny
I'm trying to surround my life, with factors that's fresh to me

[Hook]

[Verse Five: Mr. Gene Poole]
It takes a certain type of power to lead people into light
And that same power used negatively could lead 'em to fight
So let's use it right to avoid losing another life
Humans is supposed to be tight
Let's unite and go cruising tonight
This one goes out to all my cats and peeps
Who have to use gats for heat
Others bust they caps on sheets
Or rap to compete
And try to be street corner performers
Lack a little bit on free's then practice when it gets warmer
I'll ask a former band mate if he can relate
To the sure-shot, 100% pure pop in a pipe that rotates
I can move at a slow rate but it take longer to do things
I'm trying to do things now
Can't deal with my mood swings

[Verse Six:I Self Devine]
Yo!
Where was you at
In the back building with Arafat
Terrorizing on platforms
No more black form stature
Static I manifest break hard to capture
My lifestyle cool but I be the first one to react pure
My mental transcends many forms and categories
Murder stories winter flurry vision blurry can you see we?
I Self Divine 3D
Black needy Christians
Need a christening to see the visions that penetrate my facade
Weekly, then sit back and meditate chant the mantra
Break out fast and catch the martyr
Smoke a spliff and punk them niggers for a starter

[Outro]
It don't make a difference how rich you get to be. How much your chairs and tables cost. How great your luxury. It ain't home to you though it be the palace of a king. Until somehow your soul is sort of wrapped 'round everything

[Hook]

"Some folks think money means everything. But there's a lot of folks who got a lot of money. And don't have no piece of mind."
