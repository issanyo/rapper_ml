Get down

[Hook: Slug]
Round and round, upside down
Living my life underneath the ground
Round and round, upside down
Living my life underneath the ground
Round and round, upside down
Living my life underneath the ground
Round and round, upside down
Living my life underneath the ground

[Verse 1: Slug]
I never had the skills that it took to sell weed
I was too generous, too understanding of your needs
As far as school, I lacked the motivation for the occupation Preparation
Guess I'll never catch that bacon
I need to find a duty doing sales or some shit
Cause I was always good at talking people into dumb shit
Fuck it, just program some drums
I'll be honest to myself and take the wealth if it comes
Run baby, run baby
Because its metro its destined to ruin
Let go of that echo, baby what are you pursuing?
Priorities are twisted and heads not on straight
I think I'm gonna pop if I don't stop and take a long break
And find time to reflect, I need to take a second
Quit breaking my neck to get this fat paycheck
Because money is the root of all people
Ayo most people are evil so I'm on a roof shooting at bald eagles
Adrenaline, mescaline, ephedrine and apple sauce
Ain't no way to hang a platinum records on these padded walls
Every man's a faggot and all women are sluts
So I'm a whore out my love for all a y'all to shake your butts and

[Verse 2: Slug]
Somewhat exotic how a lotta these cats went about it
And when they got crowded let the boundaries clouded
I doubt that if they only knew how I was coming through
Probably be the oasis they was running to
Fashion, the lifestyle, around the fashions and lifestyles
Of entities you don't know much less trust judgment
Judgmental, the soldier with the common pencil
So say what's up when you see me on the bus
Ayo, the worst is yet to come, in fact its on its way
You better go and get you some before there ain't no more today
And hey I'll be just fine, trying to bust rhymes
Got my eye on my son and my hand on my nine o' clock
The clock stops, for everybody that you know that got shot
And eight o' clock the seconds get hesitant for every cat that went in an accident
And seven o' clock time stands still for everyman killed by the planet's build
Consumed by the elements, water, earth, wind, fire
When I die I wanna go like that, fuck the devil's development

Living my life underneath the ground
Round and round, upside down
Living my life underneath the ground
Round and round, upside down
Living my life underneath the ground
Round and round, upside down
Living my life...

(Get down)
Run away, come away from the land of Sodom and Gomorrah
Run away, come away from the land of the sinking sand
Run away, come away from the land of Sodom and Gomorrah
Run away, come away from the land of the sinking sand
Run away, come away from the land of Sodom and Gomorrah
Run away, come away from the land of the sinking sand
Run away, come away from the land of Sodom and Gomorrah
Run away, come away from the land of the sinking sand
