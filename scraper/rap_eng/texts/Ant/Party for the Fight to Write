[Verse]
Hides the eyes beneath the bill of the cap
Walks amongst the flies that hover over the mat
He lies, but only when there's a reason
Measures life by the tragedy, the comedy, the season
Poor at handling and managing income
Got enough love to pass around and then some
Been done, that there a name you can trust
Read the whole match book and put a flame to the brush
Good with pets, and rips up sex
Put the show in biz, try to give what you get
When you let him run free with the thought
Pull the line in, try to see what you caught
I ain't all that bad, but I ain't all that great
I went back to the lab and began to mutate
Wait. I still look the same, still got the same dumb name
Ain't a damn thing changed
But if you like surprises, I know of a party
Where they all dance around to your heart beat
Bring your own agenda and embrace your flaws
Lets put a face on this common cause

[Hook]
And he said some got pencils and some got guns
Some know how to stand and some of them run
We don't get along, but we sing the same song
Party for the fight to write, and write on

Stay gold, Ponyboy, stay true outspoken
Make a record Mr. Gangster and get 'em all open
The theories, the stories, the truths, the myths
Its all therapy, on top of turntable riffs
This indutry's big, so big, in fact
We can all get some, and we can give some back
And if its done correct, we'll make more than noise
So pick it up, and pick me up when you're bored with the toys
As a child hip-hop made me read books
And hip-hop made me wanna be a crook
And hip-hop gave me the way and something to say
And all I took in return is a second look
Son, you're shook, cause ain't no such thing as half way there
Getting good at actin' like you just don’t care
The circle of life, tryin' to make it square
Conditionin' self to sit still and stare
Oh where have all the sheep gone…
Burnt down the farm and turned the TV on
John Coltrane, Marvin Gaye and Bob Marley all get invitations to my party

[Hook]

And if I spent anymore time inside my head
I'd probably need some leather straps attatched to my bed
And if I go another day without eating a meal
I'm gonna show you what it means to keep it real
And if they keep shooting guns up and down my block
I swear to God I'll be the first one to call the cops
And if I gotta hear that song ever again
You're gonna have to share some of that beer, my friend
They mistake me as happy-go-lucky
Just another base-head bobbin' nobody
But from where I stand, they sound like spies
Fillin' all the children's heads with lies
Well alright, get your money right
But right now tonight I want you to pick a side
So when you got your power and you got your cheddar
Let's get together soldier over throw this hold and make these roads better
Bring it on (right now)... He said, "Bring it on" (right now)... he looked you in the eye, and he said, "Bring it on" (right now)
Ain't nothin' but a party y'all... let's get it on

[Hook x2]
