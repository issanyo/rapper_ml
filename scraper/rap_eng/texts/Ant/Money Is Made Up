[Verse]
Pick your poison in some loin cloths, fuck that nuance, danced in the rain for a couple coupons. And that nuisance didn't stop the shooting, but I'll still walk around like I'm rooting tooting. Who's Larry The Cable Guy's electric man? Go away wearing hide my erection pants. Grabbed a bottle, started swimming in my head, at least, reach 100 views and then act like that's a mega feat. This frat boy raped this little lady. She was an engineering major and her name was Katy. Katy's too scared to ever tell her story. She's a victim, but she feels less important. My problems are a little less major, my existence's a glorified rager. Constellations are taking over the majority, I'm surrounded like a virgin in sororities. Nice one little girl, trapped in a tilt a whirl, worse than when your God motherfucking killed the world. Back when B.C. was all of our history and evolution was a motherfucking mystery. I misspoke and said the wrong words, smoke blunts cause these cunts gave birth to earth. In denial, success my biggest rival, write my sextape record that shit on vinyl. Leak it to the world, say it was an accident, go on talk shows to be asked about my flaccid dick. Go to church and sit in the back pew, hand down my pants cause I lack shit to lose. Speak to my mother, brag about success, she says I curse too much and shouldn't talk about sex, I guess

[Outro]
Everybody complaining that they're rates up, I tell them their money's made up. I tell them their money's made up (Ã—2)
