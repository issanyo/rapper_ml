[Kel Francisco]
Ratchet ass nonsense, that is what we on
We boppin' out the window when we hear our favorite song
Swervin' lane to lane, turn up running through my veins
And if you ain't with it, catch up to the campaign
Don't get it twisted dummy, my key is usually low
But if its a fiesta then I'm in it with my amigos
Cups of that white, blunts of that green
You probably ain't turnt if you ain't off of those things
My brother got dreads, but bet he faded
And when it comes to these thots he probably got one naked
We reckless ass niggas, live with no consequence
And if we fuck shit up tonight it ain't our first offense
What you know about hoppin' out the whip and boppin' at the red light
Then hop back in and burn out, green light we swervin' all night (uh)
That's how it is inside the city of wind
If you down just let the turn up begin (just like that)

[Hook]
I be on that turn up, turn up, turn up
That boppin' in the street
That ain't no turning down so put this song up on repeat
That Kemo walkin', paper chasin'
Jackball, swervin' racin'
Ratchet ass nonsense, like it ain't't no consequence

Consequence, like it ain't no consequence (2x)

That Kemo walkin', paper chasin'
Jackball, swervin' racin'
Ratchet ass nonsense, like it ain't't no consequence

Now I'm that turn up kid that's always down to roll
And life is still an adventure because I'm just 20 years old
Sometimes the party life seem like its just the way to go
And I'm trying to make sure when I'm 30 that I don't regret before
Let's find a corner and bend it, because I'm trying to get in it
Fuck them niggas with them Gucci belts we knows they not authentic
And they might be real, but that's just how I feel
Because I'm fresher that that prince that's livin' in Beverly Hills
While I'm maxin', relaxin', looking for some action
Try not to get into while I'm riding down Jackson
But I ain't never worried because haters never hurt me
Tell them girls that they can swallow me if they keep actin' thirsty
We boppin' out the window, acting like some hoodlums
Anybody living young, wild, and free then I salute em'
Because if Kel got the thots, then you know that he sharing
Noel get her and her and I get shorty that keep staring
