(Verse 1: Ant and Free)
Thought I’d end up with Kevin
But he wasn’t a match
Wrote some songs about Rorie
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Alex i'm so thankful
Wish I could say thank you to Alexis
Cuz’ she was an angel

(Verse 2: Free)
One taught me porn
One taught me taste
One taught me gay
Now I have aids

(Verse 3: Ant)
I've analed and i’ve sucked
But that’s not what I recieved
Look what you taught me
And for that I say…

(Verse 4: Ant and Free)
Bomb you, next (next)
Bomb you, next (next)
Bomb you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for isis
Bomb you, next (next)

(Verse 5: Renee)
Spend more time with my peaches
I ain't worried 'bout herpes’'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better anal
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Cora
And I'm so oui with that (so oui with that)

(Verse 6: Ant)
She taught me racism (racism)
She taught me transphobia (transphobia)
How she handles aids (aids)
That shit's amazing (yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

(Verse 7: Peaches)
LovelyPeaches on the track
This beat burnin’ and itchin’
Don’t leave me ‘round yo man ‘cause yo dude gonna go missing
Travel all around the world, yes I’m on a mission
He say it burn when he be pissing
I’m completing my mission
So much I wanna say I just can’t make it rhyme
That nigga breath stank so I let him hit it from behind
Two brothers, what that mean?
Two dicks at a time?
But they only last six seconds, I guess they made vine. Shid
On to his cousin, that nigga was fine
Ion even know his name but I bet he know mines
He said, “Peaches, you lovely
But you don’t smell like your name”
He said my pussy smell like fish and it tastes the same
He brought me some soap like I’m supposed to be ashamed

(Verse 8: Ant and Free)
Bomb you, next
Bomb you, next
Bomb you, next
I'm so fuckin'

(Verse 9: Julia)
One day I'll walk down to prison
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking cora
'Cause she grew my aids womb
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make peaches lunch last
Peaches forbid something happens
Least this song is a flop (song is a flop)

(Verse 10: Free)
I've got so much aids (aids)
Got so much herpes (herps)
I've learned from the rape (peaches)
I turned out ok (turned out a trany)
I've loved and I've lost (yeah, cora)
But that's not what I see (yeah, fag)
'Cause look what I've found (positive pregnancy test)
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I'll say

(Verse 11 & 12: Ant, Free, Renee, Peaches, Julia, and Remy)
Bomb you, next (thank you, next)
Bomb you, next (thank you, next)
Bomb you, next

(Verse 14: Ant & Free)
One day I go to Manchester
Holding hands with my mama
A bomb goes off somewhere
‘Cause ari blew it up and caused trama
Only wanted to see her, real bad
She said i'm gon bomb yo shit fast

And for that, she says…
Bomb u, next…
