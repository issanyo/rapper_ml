Hey, how you doing?
Ain't seen you in a long time
Is everything all fine?
Doing your best?
I'm glad to hear it
It's all progress, yeah that's the spirit
Look at you, you look great!
It seems like you kept your self in good shape
You stopped drinking, huh?
Congratulations!
You back in school too?
That's fascinating
So what you doing now a days?
You living here again or just visiting for the holidays?
Yeah yeah
How's your family, how's you mommy and daddy?
They living happily?
So tell me all about LA
Huh, you don't live in LA?
Hold up, wait wait wait
Chicago, how's Chicago?
What, no?
Well where you living then?
Ohhhhhhhh, my fault, please forgive me
Bad memories, so how's the big city?
You paying dues, you making moves?
Yeah I always knew someday you'd break through
You've forever been a go getter
And I won't forget that, bet that I'll remember
I never told you this
But I wish you the best, success and all that other shit
But that's my cue, I got stuff to do
It was a special surprise to bump into you
Stay safe, you have yourself a great day
Wait, what was that?
What you say?
My phone number?
Nah I don't think so
I only gave it to a handful of close people
Let's not make this into an issue
But the truth is

I don't miss you

La La La La La
I will disappear
La La La La La
No far and no near
La La La La La
You are not my dear

I don't care where you go from here

La La La La La
I will disappear
La La La La La
No far and no near
La La La La La
You are not my dear

There's no tears next to your name here

La La La La La
