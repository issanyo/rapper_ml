[Intro: Slug]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to give a warm welcome for...
(Anybody here ever been to Colorado? More importantly, Denver?)

[Sample]
Nothing I said, nothing I said, meant a thing to you

[Verse 1: Slug]
Here I am alone in an airport bar
Why? I guess 'cause I don't own a car
It's Valentine's day, I'm returning home from Berkley
Ain't a damn thing none of y'all can do to hurt me
Unsober, laid over in Denver
The waitress could smell it the minute I entered
There's seven shells losing their souls in here
Sporadically placed amongst scotch and beer
But there's one woman in the back left corner
Who looks like she could really use a supporter
If only I could muster the strength to be a friend
Who knows how this adventure could end
Bend me up, slip me the tongue, shoot me down
Cut me loose, bury me, and piss on the ground
Can't help but wonder, what's over yonder
Don't know if I can get down for too much longer
Everywhere I go I find at least one
And I bet it won't die till the travellin's done
For as long as I run, my heart holds a gun
Up to the side of my head, ride and die for the young

[Sample]
Nothing I said, nothing I said, meant a thing to you

[Hook (repeat to fade)]
It's the sound of emotion enough
To make me wanna hang myself from the rafter that's over my bed
But when I stop to climb the ladder that's embedded in my heart
I start to question all the emotion in my head

[Sample]
Nothing I said, nothing I said, meant a thing to you

[Sample]
Hello darlin'. You been waiting long for me?
