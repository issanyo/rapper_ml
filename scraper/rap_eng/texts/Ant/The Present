I take my blunts to the face, 'til you feel the bass
I'm the other side of the coin, here to put you in your place
Inside of a pocket
So keep your friends close
Money, weed, a pen, and some busted ass headphones
Negativity is left home, I kept on
I'm living the life inside of my dreams
That's why I'm slept on
Sunrise to sundown, I'm listening to the sound
It's time to turn up the fucking volume of the town
Now it goes like this, I'm taking it off the list
And the way I'm living my life is getting other people pissed
Oh sure, I will be missed by the people I assist
I'm trying to find a way to stop living like this
If it ain't a blunt, it's a mic
From the day 'til the night
Taking a left and then a right
I just want to find the light
Take my check with respect and write whatever's left
And plus I barely slept, you gotta work with what you get
And if I had something else, I'd gladly change the subject
"Date with divinity, she hasn't let me fuck yet"
And I'm quoting not biting
I'm hella fucking high as I'm writing
Feelings never hiding, true self is never hidden
That's why I keep spitting
So now I put my life inside of bars that I written
With a broken pen and a girl I'm trying to chase
So I guess I'll take my chance and see if love's a better place
Or time put to waste
I'd rather think not
I only chase dreams cos it's the every thing I got
Lost in the ink drops, blots, holes, to broken dreams
Went from knowing where I want to be, to smoking trees
And I'm holding these lonely memories
And I'm holding mixed feelings like I'm mixing up a remedy
A voice and a melody, to make a better me
I do it all for you, I hope that life will let us see
I'm just an emcee, it ain't too hard to find me
You can turn yourself around if you really don't like me
You don't have to
It's simple how I'm living
A form of broken rules, using everything he's given
It's that pursuit of happiness, I'm trying to reach that
Living off the daily question of, "Where's the weed at?"
Success, I see that, the mic is where I be at
This where me and my future chose to meet at
The present

Living my life in my head, doing drugs instead
Living my life 'til I'm dead
