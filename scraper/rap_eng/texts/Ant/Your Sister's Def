Brothers out there with sisters, peep it
Years and years you try to keep her a secret
Said she's your cousin that came for a visit
Your putting me on, is this true, now who is it?
Called your crib, got a clicking dial tone
You said it was the maid that hung up the phone
Caught her on the streets, so we took the risk
Guess what, we found out she was your sis
Now we're not Tom, Dick, Harry, or Roy
Let us crack the freak, because we're your boys
Tonight we're dropping by cause your parents left
The Beastie Boy gonna let you know

Your sister's def

She's so hook, is she, how can it be?
Don't lie, she's not in your family
Cause if you didn't know, people spread the word
Your a square sucker whipped, yes, you're a nerd
To be down, there's one thing you'll discover
Your sister must be a plash Beastie lover
So don't get sick, she was our pick
I hope her tongue is long, we like to be licked
You'll see it's not hard, it's naughty nice
You gotta pay us dues, and she's the price
Don't start to think about the world's discuss
Your sister's gotta hang, and that's a must
It's plain and simple, it ain't no thing
She's real def, let us give her a ring
So we conclude, this is your best move
Welcome, the Beastie Boys approve

This week we all will meet
Right now the party season will reach its peek
Juice all around town, we're on the guest lists
We'll bring three tricks, you bring your sis
Pay attention real close, we just begun
Trick number one is to grab her buns
We'll loose control, but we'll keep it clean
She better not wear a dress, wear the blue jeans
New or faded, we want 'em tight
Take the pockets off so we can grip it right
Stand in front, we wanna see what we like
If the room's too dark, you bring a flashlight
Two is do the do, for the whole crew
A dead giveaway cause we're giving her clues
She better be ready to play the wall
Cause it's all for one, and one for all
No matter who's first, let's start the show
There are no rules, go for what you know
We won't slack up, won't let her rest
Our pride is on the line, to see who's best
Now that you've heard thoughts quite absurd
Convince your sis, put in a good word
Your sister's def

At last a neurotic feast
We're slaying your sister like a horny beast
So don't get mad, don't be upset
It's now her time to be a Beastie pet
As you can see most definitely
Is trick number three, pure fantasy
Now we're your friend, and you're her brother
But your sister's so def we might scheme on your mother
We can't ignore now that we saw
She's def so we wanna be your in-law
We're having fun, yo, we ain't done
The Beastie Boys has just begun

Because your sister's def

Took a walk around the crack of dawn
I noticed her bedroom light was on
Her shadow moved over as the lights went lower
I crept to the window to see a little closer
Said to myself, I got it made
The window was open, so was the shade
Came in real neat, she was in heat
Your sister gave a class A peach-o treat
Her clothes got thinner, I showed her my winner
Beastie beef is now served for dinner
Your sister's def

Later on I came around the way
But sis MCA said he got some play
There had to be a reason for the news I learned
Time to get on it cause it's Mike D's turn
Nobody was home, I didn't see the car
She took me downstairs and we crashed the bar
We was chilling in the basement, drinking Red Wipple
After a while my head between pink nipples
Grabbing at your sis cause I can't resist
I start to dive, pummel her rumble fish
When I got through, next thing she knew
On her thighs was a Beastie tattoo

That's it, Adrock is pissed
If you leave me in the room with your sister, I'm taking her clit
You can bet if she gets wet
The King Adrock will make her sweat
I throw her down, then take her underwear
Then search 'em so I can eat the pubic hairs
Even in her dream scene, she starts to scream
It's the Adrock inches, and you know what I mean
We had her in the week, your sister's cheap
The Beastie Boys just made a clean sweep
