Hands and heart and harmony
Loving one another and sights to see
Hands and heart and harmony
Living together in unity

We know survival is the key
And so much depends on you and me
Living together in unity
There'll be no place for lazy ones
They too must give a helping hand

Hands and heart and harmony
Loving one another
What a sight to see
Hands and heart and harmony
Forward together in unity

If we unite, we cannot fail
Though the road is a very sweet trail
Forward we'll grunt the bridge and overcome together
I know what can be done

'Cause that's a meaning of hands of heart
And harmony forward together in unity
Bubbling together in harmony
Step in together in unity; onward together in unity

Hands and heart and harmony  (2x)

We know hard times are mighty rough
It's one thing that can really get tough; that's no bluff
But great, great times we cannot change
If we just link up like a chain

We're good together with hands and heart and harmony
Loving one another; what a sight to see
Hands and heart and harmony living together in unity
Forward together in unity; bubbling together in harmony

Hands and heart and harmony onward together in unity
Linking together in unity; moving together in harmony
Moving together in unity; trotting together in unity
