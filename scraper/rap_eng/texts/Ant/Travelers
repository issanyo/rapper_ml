[Coast]

My whole life I was weaker than your weak style
There's no excuse for your wackness, keep loud
Just to let um know that space style garbage
It's harmless, the real emcees they so novice
We so bonkers, these kids tryna understand
How we do, what we do but it's nothing planned
Something said then what up, gotta tell um ??
If you bad wouldn't let you hit my blunt of rags
We ain't friends, spare me all the small talk
Petrified of your shadow, you all soft
I'm not tryna be the tough guy type
But if you don't hop off my balls I just might
Punch you in your crusty jibs and keep moving
I can't help myself they so stupid
Why would I be down with your clown ass features
So my strengths make up for your weakness
Oh Jesus please let me have the strength
To not hurt um in they feelings and have restraint
I'm tryna act like I'm grown, not hating
But I was blessed with a lot, not patience
My statements are harsh but I keep it real
I won't lie on my heart, this is how I feel
Your arrogant approach and your slick comments
I catch all that shit, it's just nonsense
I know you hate my guts but can't face the facts
That I'll fuck you up if it came to that
I'm a fat piece of shit, ain't nothing change
Still rapping for myself, still fuck the game
I worked hard since a kid, still stack paper
I don't give a fuck if we ever that major
It's the cause and effect, mad drama
Just expect the worst, it's Bad Karma

[Hook - Coast]
It's the cause and effect, mad drama
Just expect the worst, it's Bad Karma
Put it out and it come back speeding
Faster than you fucks even come up with reasons
[2x]

[Tones]

It's the cause and effect flying by you when I freestyle
This the Healer walking down the Green Mile
Look at my words, you see the eyes of the seeds
They thinking back to me like waking their dreams
Travel your minds with a word to hit you hard
Seeing visions of your past sitting in the dark
Waiting for the moment with your soul on the line
Who knew your gang was plotting on you the whole time
?? with family like ODB at the Grammy's
Speak my mind whether or not you understand me
I'm live you can't bear me, you gotta kill me
Sometimes I wonder does Illuminati feel me
I know they hear me, every word clearly always
I'm screaming is there still time as it all fades
They don't get it though, still the words mean
More than the gift of a blunt to a herb fiend
You couldn't hit the rags like East Coast said
I cut off your mic and chop off your head
I'm saying I could back it up, you rappers suck
You would have to be out your mind to battle us
Fucking amateurs is all I see in this rap game
Talking cars, they got your social and last name
Holding you hostage on your paycheck claiming tax
Money is fake, real worth is what you lack

(Hook - Tones)

[Tabs]

The wall travelers around the globe we blow spots
Can't even get recognition on our own blocks
Oh you hold Glocks? you still gonna get cold cocked
With the rest of your clique and stuffing your bitch like Stove Top
They know not what they do Father please forgive um
They whole clique is filled with bitch, I can see it in um
I holler and I scream when I see these ?? visions
A dollar and a dream that's how the team is living
Why bother another dollar, another debt to pay
Slugs flying, just trying to get away
Haunted mentally, taunted by the memory of yesterday
Let's just say it's another reason to let the weapons spray
Instead I'm smoking kush, my life's an open book
But you couldn't gather the data no matter how close your looked
You shouldn't push me pussy you know you shook
I'ma throw a hook and spit some heat to leave the beef overcooked
I'm unstable that's how I'm able to fry cats
You don't need a chiropractor to get your spine cracked
My raps climax over high hats
I sip liquor til I see the big picture like Imax
The main attraction cuz I make it happen
Take evasive action before I break your face to fragments
Comparing me to lames and has-beens
Is like comparing the door locks of Fort Knox to a paper napkin
You claiming captain, no you ain't
I know you fakes skate like a frozen lake before you leave with a broken face
I swear to God it's hard to show restraint
Or control my hate when I'm surrounded by vultures and cobra snakes
No one's safe cuz I'm walking with death
Take your head off of your neck, this is war in the flesh
You all soft, get punched in the jaw for your threats
That's the laws of respect, that's a cause and effect
