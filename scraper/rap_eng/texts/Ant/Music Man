[Intro]
Oh oh oh oh oh
Hey, where you going?
Oh oh

[Chorus]
Hey mister music man
Would you play me a song?
And help me sing along
Hey mister music man (Mhm)
Would you play me a song?
Help me sing along

[Verse]
You're the most beautiful girl
I know you hear it all the time (Hear it all of the time)
I don't what else to say
As you roll your eyes (Roll your eyes)
I don't mean so rude
But would you leave with me? (Would you leave me)
There's other girls sitting in the row
Won't keep me company (Keep me company)
Oh oh you're so fly
Can I have have your time
Oh oh don't you know
That I could do you right?
I cannot leave because I want to go with you
And can I stay the night?
I feel alright
I want you right by my side, mm
Hey hey hey

[Chorus]
Hey mister music man
Would you play me a song?
And help me sing along
Hey mister music man
Would you play me a song?
Help me sing along

[Verse]
I feel like being around friends
But I can't figure out who that is
Everybody is leaving
Said the music man living in my head
Sing a song just one more song
And sing it strong and make it long
And I wanna leave with somebody's self
But I can't figure out where I belong
So then I sit and watch them go
The winter's hot, the summer cold
It's better than you've ever felt
But not as bad as being by yourself
And I wish I was someone else
And I wish I was somewhere else
And my opinions don't mean a thing
When no one's here to share this drink with me

[Chorus]
Hey mister music man
Would you play me a song?
And help me sing along
Hey mister music man
Would you play me a song?
Help me sing along

[Outro]
There's no around I want to talk to
Everyone is laughing in the bathroom
Nothing to say but, "How are you?"
Can you casually explain bird "Who are you?"
Mister music man
Mister music man, oh
I miss music man, no
I miss the music, man
