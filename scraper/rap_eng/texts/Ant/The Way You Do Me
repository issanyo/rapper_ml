Hey girl, you sounding real good tonight
I sang along with every song
And that one song - you know which one ? -
When you did that one you got me
You know what ?
I think you wrote that song about me
Nah I'm cool, but thank you
I think I better go
I just wanted to say, yeah, good show

[Hook]
The way you do me
I can tell that you mean well
The way you do me
But I don't need help
The way you do me [x2]

You're so agreeable

[Verse 1]
My guts say to make an escape
Don't wait til it breaks
Get the prey that you chase and hit the side door
If you gonna stay to the wake
Don't play it so safe
You'll never raise up the stakes or hit the high score
My brain say to measure the steps
It's no different than chess
Progress and protect, get the queen
Now I gotta
Push the set for the check
Connect the pressure direct until it bleed out
My heart said to ask my veins
If they have the strain
To handle the rain and still sustain
I'm tryna catch the train until my glass is drained
I'm just another passenger, I can't complain
Because..

[Hook]
The way you do me
I can tell that you mean well
The way you do me
But I don't need help
The way you do me [x2]
