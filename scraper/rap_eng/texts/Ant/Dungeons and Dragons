[Verse 1: Slug]
Kinetic responses were heard frequent in the past
When speakin lashes to the tongues of father's demons semen
Somehow catered to the whims of later stood
Check the youth, shoot like stormtroopers theorizing Darth Vader hood
Gave a good thumbs up type of scream
To symbolize the arrival
Cause we've arised from the dream
With a red beam that fastens to my chest
Wearin' a string of beads of sweat
Decorating this helmet that shelters and protects my laptop
The brain contains the game
And the fast talk
More traffic than the average vagrant's favorite crack spot
Last stop
To catch a breath for twenty miles
Cause this field is filled with more snakes
Than MC's that fake their freestyles
Your optimism, is far from natural
Caught the label of asshole
Cause I'm twice as tight as the rest, this rappin's vaginal
Stand clear, cause when my shit comes, the big fun
Pushin' up in and out of your bitch system like a piston
Glistening, in the twilight, hill top, with his ability, stablility
And shoot my spunk on your soliloquy
The children see right through the smoke screen
The mist around your own soul provoking, your own choking

[Break: Musab]
Era '97 the haters smash the tribe of Set
New ward, what are the most important things in life?
To crush enemies? To see them driven before you?
And to hold the head of opponent MC's, in your bare hands
Haha

[Verse 2: Musab]
I'm a co-founder
And one that likes to lounge on
Overcrowded spots so I can find someone to clown on
A hound dog, sniffin' out the unwanted
I said I'd let you live, but I never could keep a promise
With a lot of shit in my cottage
Come to my store, tryin to fight
Get fucked like Marcellus Wallace
The BE calls it, anybody wanna, wander, on to the stage and try ta Cha Cha
Blah blah, that's all I'm hearin
From the opposition. Just a buncha cocky dissin, ya kiddin
Wanna battle, huh?
Last two times
Mc's were found dead
In a fast food line
Mash you, I'mma mash you (who them?)
Yeah that crew
Separate the bitches like a capsule cause they fragile
Knock em off the saddle
Make em flip to the leaves
And they'll wake up paralyzed like, Christopher Reeves
Take a breath, here quick
Take one more
Before you finally realize that ya layin' in the morgue
This is the core, of the underground
Listen cause I'm sayin' somethin' now
The BE, only one allowed

[Break: Musab]
Steel is not strong...flesh is strong
You understand me boy?
Watch, watch this, you you, come here, come here
Come to me, come to me, witness this

[Verse 3: Slug]
I'm kind of conservative when it comes to this rap shit
Cause when I glance across the surface all the words is written backwards
And actions speak much louder than your heavy rotation
I'll rock a crowd that's never heard of us, on any occasion
No longer patient
You got my cranium Achin
Prepare my awareness
And start to measure up these square pegs
To figure out which crescent wrench it's gonna take
To beat this stake into my skull
To numb, and dull this headache
Fiberglass rappers leave with cracked brains
Shattered names line the hallways of all the ways I came
Contained under lids, locks and a two headed dog, with a sawed off
Is where Ant makes the breaks to get your rocks off
Molotov tossed into the ring of lost causes
Formerly known as MC's (southside lost provisions)
Cause it's more cost-efficient to kill the bad apple and save the core
Then to let nature run it's course, of course
You cross me, spread my wings and leave you stranded on this planet
(Cross me, spread my wings and leave you stranded on this planet)
Cross me, spread my wings and leave you stranded on this planet
Dungeon after dungeon, dragon after dragon after dragon

[Outro: Musab]
Era '97, smash the tribe of Set, all the snakes
Slitherin' amongst the fakes, amongst the temples of set. Smashed
