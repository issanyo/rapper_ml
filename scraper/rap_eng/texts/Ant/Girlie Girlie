[Chorus]
Young man, you too girly girly
You just flash it around the world
Young man, you too girly girly
You just flash it around the world

[Verse 1]
He has one up here, one down there
One in the city, one down the shore
One is a lawyer, one is a doctor
One of them works with a little contractor

One down East, one down West
He has one up North and two down South
And one sells pot
And she keeps on hanging out

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
He has one in school, one big fool fool
He has one every time I say she thinks she rules
One is a nurse, she says she come first
The other night them going out and pick her a new purse

One is a star, one works in a bar
She can smile when the two of them spar
One get get, one fret fret
He won't drink no other milk but Betty

Too girly girly
You just flash it around the worldie
Young man, you too girly girly
You just flash it around the world

[Chorus]

One in Canada, one in Uganda
One in America, one Cuba
One in Russia, one in China

[Chorus]
Young man, you too girly girly
You just flash it around the worldie
Young man, you too girly girly
You just flash it around the world

A big fat one who's a go-go dancer
A little slim one who's a radio announcer
One height height, one flight flight
Before he grows old he wants one on the North Pole

One in a London one in Japan
One in Scotland, one in Finland
One in Taiwan, one in Iran
One in Syria, one Tanzania

One in LA, one in Australia
One in New York, one in Antigua
One Grenada, one in China, one in India
One Bolivia, one Tortuga

[Chorus]
