[Chorus]
Excuse me if I come off strong
But lately I haven’t slept very much
And it seems that every time I try to say something smooth
The words refuse to roll off of my tongue

Perhaps I could be misreading your body
‘Cause with that language I was never fluent
A couple inches makes a difference, strange turns to friendship
And within a couple seconds it could all be ruined

[VERSE #1]
I hope one day you notice that I’m here
And that whenever you’re around is when my attitude’s weird
You see I’ve always kind of had a little thing for you
But when it starts to show, another guy appears
To me, you’re the most gorgeous girl that I see
You got those beautiful eyes that leave me weak in the knees
And when you let your hair down so it can blow in the breeze
I know every other lady fills with jealousy
And it’s funny how you’ve got this hold over my thoughts
The thought of you with someone else makes me want to stop
‘Cause to live life without you is asking a lot
And I’m not very good at putting up a façade
So, I’m a just leave this all out here
And y’all can figure out who to me endears
And pardon me if I came off strong
But I had to get my thoughts out and into a song

[Chorus]

[VERSE #2]
I know this is probably all just a lost cause
And this really just makes me look odd
But I really love the way that you talk
Even when it’s misheard dialogue
And you’re very smart too, won’t accept no C’s
And you’re gonna graduate with a college degree
Me, on the other hand, all I will be
Is just another man with dreams of sweeping you off your feet
Believe me girl I’m trying hard to be a winner
So I can finally take you out to dinner
But every time I wanna ask, I get a little shy
‘Cause veni, vidi, vici isn’t part of this guy
But I could be your sun, and you could be my moon
And we could do whatever you want to
Maybe even move out to Arkham
Where love is not crafted but better grown from a garden
