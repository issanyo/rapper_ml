You rap for a living but you wish you could sing

Ayo Ma
People are starting to support the music
Self-esteem getting a little boosted
Me and Derek, we made a record, a lot of our friends bought it
RSE, we built a label and heads caught it
Yo Mom, I'm grinning
But most the time it's fake
Too much on my head, it makes the thoughts ache
For God's sake Sean, take a capsule, painkiller, Advil
Tame your bad self, quit being an asshole
Hey Moms, I could use, just a few more hours of sleep, I think I need to push snooze
There's no way I can lose, cause it's not a game
I'm confident; no matter where I land it's all the same
It's all insane
And I'm beginning to adapt
Stepping around the potholes, time-bombs, and mousetraps
And when I fall flat I'll smile
I gotta go, I'll call you back
I'm teaching Jacob how to freestyle

"To The Break of Sean"
Tell everyone I'm doing alright Mom
It goes "To the Break of Sean"
Tell everyone I'm doing alright Mom
It goes "To the Break of Sean"
Tell everyone I'm doing alright Mom
It goes "To the Break of Sean"
Tell everyone I'm doing alright Mom
All night long
