[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
And if we had all the same things
Mad at all is what the pain brings
I'm not sad, I love to bring you
Happiness ain't try to save me
Carry me is what shame brings
No God at all is what I'm remembering

[Chorus]
Bury me in light of the candles, light of candles
I swear, place is burning down, yeah
Tell me what you want from me
Could you tell me what you want from me
I swear, place is burning down, yeah
Tell me what you want from me
Could you tell me what you want from me

[Verse 2]
I swear, I'm not sad, I love to bring you
Happiness ain't try to save me
Bury me in light of the candles
Watch as they all go

So I'm playing for kicks
Feeling is killing me
Nothing is real to me
My darling isn't even really dear to me
What is possessing me to stay here
And feel what I feel

Everybody gone, everyone has left here
Watch the candle burn 'til I disappear
Everybody gone, everyone has left here
Watch the candle burn 'til I disappear away, away, ooh (Away, away)

[Outro]
Place is burning down, yeah
Tell me what you want from me
Could you tell me what you want from me
I swear, place is burning down, yeah (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Tell me what you want from me
Could you tell me what you want from me
I swear, place is burning down, yeah (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Tell me what you want from me
Could you tell me what you want from me
Ooh, ooh, ooh
