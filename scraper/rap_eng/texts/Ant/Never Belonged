By myself, found myself
By myself, found myself

Don't wanna stay don’t wanna go don't wanna leave I don't wanna talk to you
Everybody it was rollin’ in I wanna go home I wanna talk to you
Is it me? Is it me? Is it me-me-me? Don't wanna talk to you
Seen so many faces and I can't remember names, don't wanna talk to you

[Verse 1]
Yeah, did coke til four in the morning
Now I'm zoning, alone at home and
Sun is rising, the moon is setting
The birds were chirping, my neighbour is cursing
Gotta go to work and get paid
Twelve years a slave, still misbehave
My cruelty betrays me too
I should have known but I didn't have a clue

[Chorus]
That everybody here is gone
No wonder I never belong
No use in me trying to hold on
And I'm sorry I can't stay too long

And he’s the one who came all alone, no one wanna talk to you
I’m not a fucking fallen star in the night [?] don't wanna talk to you
All my friends are dead, I wish them off the ledge, don’t wanna talk to you
Leave me here in a chair that's failed, be aware I wanna talk to you

[Verse 2]
I can see my house from way up here
Down there is a disaster
Ready to happen any time now
The world is open now judgment day upon us, so act modest
Godless creatures in the streets their own
Sit at home with nothing to do
Last thing I want is to watch the news
All I rather do is talk to you

[Chorus]
But everybody here is gone
No wonder I never belong
No use in me trying to hang on
I'm sorry I can't stay too long

[Verse 3]
Gotta get outside if I’ll survive
Better learn to fly or suicide
"Do or die" they say, who am I? they say
Nothing wrong but there's something wrong, wait
Times a hand for the working man
I don't feel much but the underhand
I hope you understand, a song about that
Angels wing left on my steps to go

[Chorus]
Everybody here is gone
No wonder I never belong
No use in me trying to hang on
I'm sorry I can't stay too long

And every now and again I get under my skin, don't wanna talk to you
Don't wanna hold my head and dread instead I wanna talk to you
Fuck luck, take a truck, get a bus, I don't wanna talk to you
I wanna reach you and your scar, talk to you
