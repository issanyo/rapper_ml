[Verse 1: Slug]
Who shot ya?
New Poppa
Half Man, Half Chewbacca
Got the tools to achieve a complete nirvana
Mosquito larvae hold your feet to the lava
Sweet Momma, I need some water
Spin around like propellers from a helicopter
Got a monster , living underneath your posture
I’m not your doctor, get off my collar

[Verse 2: Haphduzn]
You dudes should get used to defeat or regret
Apply pressure to lessers with my feet on they neck
‘Till it breaks like a b-boy then beat on my chest
Hands free with this rapping, I don’t need y'lls press
Leave them tricks up your sleeves, please we aren’t impressed
I don’t stress what they be on, I'm beyond their best
Never met a beat that I can’t free on yet
Evolved, now everything that I breathe on’s fresh

[Verse 3: Nazeem]
Future stockholders, you cannot hold this
Cops around the corner better practice jumping fences
It was hide and seek, then hide your  piece for big brother’s henchmen
Catch you pigs slipping , turn an officer to chitlins
I was born and raised hell, 26 and Blaisdell
E-Street gentrified, G-s and vegan bake sales
These hipsters walk the same street that thugs do
But that’s just Minneapolis anyone can catch a slug too

[Verse  4: Mike The Martyr]
What you symbolic for?
We spit the hottest sauce
You olive oil to water or
Kinda raw? I’m column strong
The martyr raw on any kinda song a connoisseur the cottage saw
Drink it to the bottom from here to Baltimore we brought the raw
Rhyme phenomenal, turn a party to a sauna soon as i resume
Tryna have the stash bottle by my room
Know how to move collateral
This my catapult
My Michael Campbell flow
Hanging out like a camel-toe

[Verse 5: Mally]
So stupid, throw me on a small bus
All out in the open like dog nuts
Advice is priceless - keep steppin’
But if you won’t bite my tip then ingest it
Still flexin’, uh, fluorescent
Blow these small candles out they got a death wish
And you won’t even make it to the cake
Every dog has his day, you can take it to the bank

[Verse 6: Prof]
Woo-Ha, Woo-Ha
Got you all in check
I’m shitting on them rappers that you thought the best
Young Stud is a thug on the microphone
I’m like one of the illest , I am a cyclone
Bitch know damn well who this is
Elephant Dick
Prof'll go to hell for this shit
I got a lot on my plate like a fat kid
Weed fill the pocket of my jacket

[Verse 7: I.B.E.]
Uh, this, that, in the third
Kick back, hit the herb
We just stay misunderstood, they can get the bird
Drunken masters shot after shot
But he didn’t squirm, Or walk
Still sizzling hot, when a beef occurred
Gift and a curse, pros and cons in a situation
Roaming in the control system I’m manipulation
Well equipped with the Merch
Your Quench list is thirst
Paying dues on a daily
Yeah i’m on my Murs

[Verse 8: Musab]
Flow Nautical
No gold on my collarbone
I lay low in a cottage home
Yeah, sippin’ scottish from a goblet
I’m living pretty modest but I’m polished
My history is spotted
Leave my enemies demolished
Like it’s ten of me, I’m obvious
It’s crucial
I’m like a painting of a fruit bowl
Only but a few know

[Verse 9: Slug]
Live wire, shine brighter
Death be the only way i get to retire
It’s a, all-nighter, this ain't my lighter
But it is my life inside of the fibers
Got a feeling that the field’s on fire
The Shepard spoke said “aim for the snipers”
And y’all stare like i came with a tiger
Blood is the color of my love for a biter
