[Verse]
I'm not the same since I left
Sold my soul in hollywood for a deal and a check
And a bad bitch. Who don't complain when she give
Me neck who don't restrain when I'm biting her chest
I been real stressed. But I know that I'm gonna be a star
But they act they like they don't hear me
I remember being up in the whip I turn my song on
Everybody turning around like who the fuck is this?
Damn dude spit I never heard this... yo I'm like man
That's me. Never took a brother serious
Up in third period writing raps down but y'all gone see
I swear, one day I'ma be on tv I did that last year
They still sleep on me. But dawg I'ma be great
And I'ma pack stadiums one day like OJ at USC I been
In this weird place of late I moved away
From my home I just wanna paint
Just to hit the stage just to find my ways
So I'ma slave to the mutherfucking page? Sacrificed everything chasing fucking fame is this tiny apartment
I think my friend hate me I know my ex hate me
Cause I was only 15 and I wasn't ready to have that baby
Ya know... fuck is this to real for a song life gets real
When you living it wrong life gets ill
When you in the danger zone
Being black in america is one
Cause we becoming victims of the gun
NAS said it best I gave you power
You lying my people to rest in that uniform
Like the lord had gave you power but
No religon no Malcom nor Garvey or Martin
Just a man with a spirit like James Harden
A younging from Houston who came off the bench
But now De'Wayne starting shit nah De'Wayne starving
No food in my kitchen turn around you see I'm ballin
Not in which a baller balls but when a kid
Growing up really fast and can't answer when his mom
Calls. Cause he in the stu faded off the vibes
Tryna save the world like superman in disguise
That's like the realist shit I ever wrote
I just wanna inspire before I have to go
That made me think about my granny
But before I see her I'ma need a grammy
And I swear that made me think about my granny
But before I see her again I'ma need a grammy
