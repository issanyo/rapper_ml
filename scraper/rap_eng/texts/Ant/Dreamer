[VERSE 1: Slug]
She got a condition of the heart - a heart condition
So as a kid she had to adapt to smarter livin
Not much room to rebel because of health
No drugs, no booze, just kiss and tell
Well known on the scene, jail bait queen
Had the first baby, barely eighteen
Father of the child was after one thing
When the daughter came, the dad was unseen
It don't matter, he ain't got a job
So she had to go to work and leave the baby with her mom
Second shift till the neck is stiff
But she worked to build her own nest to live
Soon after that baby's dad slash lazy bum with no cash
He want to come over and crash
He want to play his part
So she let him move into that garden level apartment
She knew better, she did it anyways
Explain better when you trynna see some better days
The suns up, catch those rays
Butterflies now, who's got chase?

[HOOK]
But she still dreams after she woke
Tight hold on that hope
Sometimes it could seem so cold do what you gotta do to cope
But she still dreams after she woke
Tight hold on that hope
Sometimes it could seem so cold do what you gotta do to cope

[VERSE 2: Slug]
Two years later, two months pregnant
Same daddy, same broke ass situation
This time the doc said her heart might break
Praise God that the job got her health benefits straight
She believes in the right to choice
But she loves baby girl and she wants a boy
Makes more now a days on the day shift
Balanced that with night classes, take some
Time and space and make it all fit
The apartment they now live in is overcrowded
Raised her voice and made her point
Told that boy, go get employed
He put on his best shirt
Said he wasn't comin back till he gets work
She knew what that part meant
So she swept every piece out that apartment
Peace out, keep out, take the scenic route
Rather only have to feed three mouths
She adapts to everything now
And nobody asks what she dreams about

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3: Slug]
A little girl was her first reason to breathe
And a little man was the first man she believed in
She gotta live right and do right by self
She do for self, she don't want your help
Afraid of bein alone, but fear ain't enough to knock her off of that stone
Gonna make that home her home, with or without a man that she could call her own
Big boss at work is anxious, continues to hand her the wrong advances
She passes the test, she knew the answers
Quit the job to go take her chance with life
This is life, we all strain
While we pray for dollars and we work for change
It's all the same, we all struggle
Sometimes you gotta say fuck you!
When you smile and she doesn't return it
Give her room, man, don't disturb it
If it makes it hurt less to curse and fight
Go ahead and hate the world, girl, you earned the right

[HOOK]
