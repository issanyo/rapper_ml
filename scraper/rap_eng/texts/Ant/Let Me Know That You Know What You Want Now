[Intro]
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)

[Verse 1]
Life's too short to be afraid of the dark
And we don't stop after making the mark
Separate your chest from your heart
To help everybody wag your tail with a lot less bark
Put the costume angst away
I was born on the year of the razorblade
I'm in the back corner of a one way train
This storm ain't nothing but Sunday rain
Let's go

[Hook]
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)
Get a taste of your soul when you hold breath
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)
We act like we got a whole lot of road left
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)
So don't mind if I drive with the top down
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)
Let me know that you know what you want now

[Verse 2]
Earthbound, aim for the soft spot
So much purpose I walk like a molotov
Shot glass, rock hard, penetrate nonstop
Cop cars on the way with the bomb squad
Now let it be known
We're trying to get ahead before we get a headstone
But a rich man still face death alone
That's why we turn up the touch and connect the tone
Get shown

[Hook]
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)
Get a taste of your soul when you hold breath
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)
We act like we got a whole lot of road left
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)
So don't mind if I drive with the top down
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)
Let me know that you know what you want now

[Verse 3]
Dashboard ain't clean as it was
Back before I first took the last seat on this bus
But the children dance when we beat the drums
And they still understand why we speak in tongues
All city, American built
A pocket full of cash take care of the guilt
The crabs all crash in a barrell of milk
But when they clear the snow I'mma steer the Seville
It goes, look for the sign, wait for the right time
A lifetime to outlive the night time
And when the paint chips fall
Gonna find my name on the wall with the crown in the skyline
I keep bad on the back of my mind
I'm an average guy, I just happen to fly
Supernatural high and I'm laughing inside
One nation with a capital I
Come on

[Hook]
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)
Get a taste of your soul when you hold breath
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)
We act like we got a whole lot of road left
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)
So don't mind if I drive with the top down
(Do you want respect, or do you want truth?)
Let me know that you know what you want now

[Verse 4]
Everybody wanna be the next to blow
So let it flow, so fresh it grow
Just to let you know I could let you go, ho ho
Millenium Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do-Do
Everybody's difficult, everybody's simple
We all on death row, we all gon' tip toe
I run with kleptos, I still wear big clothes
Hold my dick the way you hold your crystals
Pissing in the middle of nowhere
Fishing in a lake full of frozen tears
I'm like a polar bear from the Southside of over there
I disappear into the open air, Atmosphere
Get a taste of your soul when you hold breath
We act like we got a whole lot of road left
