(Verse 1)

Camera thief. Still frame
Blood boils inside the milk drain
Can't complain with how my life's turned out
I was mixed up, wild, so damn vile
Pile up the chipped prescripts
Recite my lines as I fix my limp
Take my time, you know God loves the wimp
Who wears his scars like the rings of pimps
Now tell me I'm a caked up boner
What the hell I would give just to Razor Ramona
Prep that couch, I'm your favorite loner
Next I'm out for the laziest owner
But where does the story begin
I was born in depression of American whims
Took my name from American Dim-witted freaks
Because they're just like me

(Verse 2)

White trash, I-Em-Tidus
You say I'm like him cause I'm a victim to my vices
Telling you a story through the tears of Isis
Running down her cheek originating at the iris
..Damn, what a visual
Too simple, one nation, individual
Physical, mental, emotional, residual
God's decision to present us both, now..
I'm still too young
Maybe in the future the loser will be the one
Maybe then the music will move you to speak in tongue
Maybe then the vision will lead you to tap the drum, hum...
I'm out of breath on these stair steps
"Take a break with this lady, she's fair breath
She's only here while you're taking a rest
You can't take her on the road," (I'm like) "who said?"

(Verse 3)

Faucet drip. Like a rumor
Growing in my insides, it's a tumor
Malignant itself, it puts me in hell
And gives a brand new meaning to pleasuring all the viewers
Funny that they know I'm an actor...
But don't get it's act two
This facade got them hooked, sink, line, it took
And it's a concept right out of a freshman textbook
Heh, and it makes me laugh
I took a ride down the road and the wheels were fast
I took a break just to talk about relationships
And then, made a reference to the past, well
Maybe I'll just millennium dodo
Catch me in the act, take you a photo
And with that still frame, turn a new leaf
And give a fuck you, cause you're a camera thief
