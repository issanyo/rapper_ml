Keep on runnin' back to you (Back to you)
Keep on runnin' back to you (Back to you)
Keep on runnin' back to you (Back to you)
Keep on runnin' back to you (Back to you)
I said I keep on runnin' back to you (Back to you)
Keep on runnin' back to you (Back to you)
Keep on runnin' back to you (Back to you)
Keep on runnin' back to you, oh (Back to you)

I was always there
Why you always scared? mhm
Runnin' back to you, I'm runnin' back to you
I come back again
Been without a friend, mhm
Runnin' back to you, I'm runnin' back to you

Tell me what's good
Don't tell me what's the matter
Why can't I get away, get away?
Baby, need to get away, get away from
All the shit you put me through
Point your fingers, they laugh at you
No one understand me quite like you do
I'm sick of myself, get under my own skin
Smoke you up like Jane's Addiction
Sick of you, and I'm sick of the friction
Runnin' back like I run in bed
The mess we made is still intact
God damn you so fine, wish you were mine
Fuck one more time, that'd be divine
Thrill is gone, but the will is strong
Heard the voice in my head say: "So long"

Why you wanna run around?
With the wicked and the vile, um
Why you, why you so in denial?
All the damn time

Why you wanna run around?
With the wicked and the vile
Need to get away, you need to get away
Need to get away, but

All these memories stay
They don't fade away, mhm
Runnin' back to you, I'm runnin' back to you
Man, it's all a game
I saw y'all poker face, mhm
Runnin' back to you, I'm runnin' back to you

I was always there
Why you always scared? mhm
Runnin' back to you, I'm runnin' back to you
I come back again
Been without a friend, mhm
Runnin' back to you, I keep on runnin' back

Almost tossed my life that night
You ain't worked that fight
I don't even know how I got here
I don't even wanna be here
Wakin' up in your bed
I wish I could take back what I said
I used to love who you used to be
Now I don't know ya
Thought that I told ya

Run away, run away, run away
Run away, run away from me now
Get away, get away, get away
Get away, get away from me now

Look me in my eye
Hang me out to dry
Say you don't love me
Say you don't need me

Keep on runnin' back to you (Back to you)
Keep on runnin' back to you (Back to you)
Keep on runnin' back to you (Back to you)
Keep on runnin' back to you (Back to you)
Keep on runnin' back to you, ooh (Back to you)
Keep on runnin' back to you (Back to you)
Keep on runnin' back to you (Back to you)
Keep on runnin' back to you (Back to you)
