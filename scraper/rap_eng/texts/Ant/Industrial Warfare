[Verse One: Mr. Gene Poole]
My order be, far from chronological
You're locked in a psychological cage, rapping for minimum wage
Wanna be up in lights and on stage
Entertaining big Willy Wonka's, going bonkers in the rain again
Very comical like my razor, here comes the pain again
Point at drug, yo blame him when shit gets stolen
Straight up, I'm out for delf, if niggas don't feel like rolling
Rawhiding it, greasy sliding it, till it's swollen
You think it's easy picking up a mic, it is
But it's something totally different to be knee deep in the biz
If you don't keep your shit
Publishing, manuscripts
You get pimped like a bitch
MC's get ready for this

[Slug]
Smile
Here comes the picture
Click
A humble type of brother so don't play me like a vic'
I can't relate to the MC's
That tempt me
With that typical, traditional enemy type of tendencies
And I can't deal with your man asking to climb upon the reels
Just cause that bitch feels he's real
And no, I can't cope with anyone taking it's like a joke
Hahahaha
Very funny motherfucker now choke

[Musab]
Pointless
Trying to get boisterous, anointed
You shouldn't have put your trust on which way the coin flips
Who you think you toying with?
Did you read the RSC embroidering?
On the back of the jackets with the gat clips
See we walk around squeezing handguns
[?] 'bout to face an outlandish trampling
When I'm blasting like a basilisk I'm coming, I'm a catalyst
Got me amped up and staggering
Did a billion dollars worth of salvaging
To the whole music business
All copy printed and documented
Sent it crumbling down
The biggest superstars getting laid off
No more free time to play golf

[Mr. Gene Poole]
Instead of having fun I'd rather clean guns at home
You be like "What's up with daddy?"
He got a war inside his dome
You roam carefully around my territory
Or you'll be written up as a victim in another scary story
Non fiction
Horror depiction
Scream, player pain infliction
Keen description of pain when one goes against my restriction
Feel your mouth numb from drilling into the teeth in my head in this
From the smoke, kill you with the leaf, your flows are dead in this
World, show no forms of life
It's over once I light the stove and warm up my knife
You blink twice and know that you dealing with the real thing
He snaps and starts tripping, fucked up off that [?]
Angels sing
Demon's place bets to see if I sell my soul
Pretty soon I'm gonna be like, "Yo, whatever pays checks"
Let that brother know everytime he makes a flow
That sounds like someone else
He's adding cheese to my wealth

[Slug]
There's no place to hide so I'm walking through the center
Right along the median
Now see me when I enter
I hesitate to lend ya an ear in fear that you would steer
It towards the same bullshit that you kicked last year
I sit, sipping on my Listerine
Patiently awaiting the downfall of the regime
And I ponder through all your time consumption
Of mic working, soul searching and find nothing

[Musab]
The headlines read, "Attack of the lyrical mutants"
They loose in the streets under the moonlight
Pack your bags, move tonight
Cause they a hundred clash strength
Got you scared, stripping ass pink

[Slug]
Grinding up believe
Between my crooked wisdom teeth
Trying to breathe more thoroughly
Officially, from here on
It's that one you cheer on
Sep Seven, steps to Heaven
Taking flight like a peasant
Shoot me down, that's the only way to land me
Kill the fantasy and go visit your family
And when that bitch said, bitch said it with a smile
Didn't give a second glance at my freestyle, meanwhile...
