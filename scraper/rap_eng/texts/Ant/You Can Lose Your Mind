Two times for my people who react off this
In an act off the energy that we get whipped
We get with this, you can lose your mind off this
Feel this shit, on and on, infinite

Two times for my people who react off this
In an act off the energy that we get whipped
We get with this, you can lose your mind off this
Feel this shit, on and on, infinite

[Verse 1: Slug]
The taste is succulent, the mental supplements
That I stuff into your thoughts
Rushing in to add substance to the broth
Scientist try to break us down to comprehend the foundation
They race around trying to duplicate the sound
The advancement of these patterns are far past man's ability to grasp
Jams the attention span, blast the previous conclusion
'Sept pollutes when I break a track for self, or make a guest intrusion
Fresh for you, and fresh for suckers, fresh for all
When the metronome clicks, begin the Dynospectrum testable
Testicles is heavy, brain matter weighs a ton
Became accustomed to carrying weight, and waiting for better days to come
And if they don't come, I'll get up and make some
And if they don't come, I'll get up and make some
Got a head full of letters trying to cut and paste 'em
A life of endeavors, I bet I die trying to chase 'em
Pacing in the basement, forth and back and forth
Wearing out my sole on the concrete floor
I pet your brain power, take your focus off fetish for cocaine powder
Dynospec takes you by the neck from those who came south

Two times for my people who react off this

Two times for my people who react off this

We get with this, you can lose your mind off this
Feel this shit, on and on, infinite

[Verse 2]
Yo I chosen to join the fight against whack rap acts
Lyrical niglets, gimmicks, and little political piglets
Who try to talk analytical with pitiful perspectives
To me its ineffective, niggas wanna get physical
Once they've been rejected, realize life goes on
You don't get the connection, it goes mic to song
Right from wrong, is what a lot of rappers made it to be
And lately been ruining the taste for all the real MCs
What I foresee is a fall for all the fabrication
Prepare when I give the final call we take back the nation
Shit's been poisoned, a decreasing immunization
Showbiz brought the medicine, but ill bring you back the nation
It's even got some of my boys in some terrible situations
I'm pacin', it be unbearable to see him as a patient
Playa, if your lacin', I hope you use cyanide
For some suicide to make it the last day you will ride
Through my neighborhood, on a compact disc or cassette
In all the latest chevy models from blazers to corvettes
And back to silhouettes, where open tailgates, nine-eights
Some out of state plates, out of town sure ain't got their mind straight

[Hook]
Two times for my people who react off this
In an act off the energy that we get whipped
We get with this, you can lose your mind off this
Feel this shit, on and on, infinite

Two times for my people who react off this
In an act off the energy that we get whipped
We get with this, you can lose your mind off this
Feel this shit, on and on, infinite

[Verse 3]
Hey yo, I ain't sayin' that you should lose your hope
But its best you realize that your crew is a joke
Your DJ's heavy headed, plus his technique spins off balance
Not to mention the dunce has got the brain of a cabbage
The magnets in your monitor must be failin'
'Cuase its a shame how you mix your tape down and try to sell it
I'm celibate, meaning I ain't fucked up an MC
Since my last LP, I guess I'm living healthy
The doctors tell me that I'm a condemned victim from pen rippin'
Brain is over-flooded and limbs missin' from my glasses
Snoopers don't want a meddle in my habits
I do you ass in when I cop verbal contractions
Mathematicians can't count the amount of rhymes
I used to smoke a lot of weed, maybe an ounce at times
My crew is on the floor from your corner store to baltimore
All over the board brothers ready to start war
I'm in a coupe like a two door, nothing can touch me
Cause for sure you know a brother packs more than fucking dully
It's only routine for me to have a mood swing so temper thy tongue my son

[Hook]
Two times for my people who react off this
In an act off the energy that we get whipped

Feel this shit, on and on, infinite

Two times for my people who react off this
In an act off the energy that we get whipped
We get with this, You can lose your mind off this
Feel this shit, on and on, infinite

I'm losing my mind,i feel my mind slipping
