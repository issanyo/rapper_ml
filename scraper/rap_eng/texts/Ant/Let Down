[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
I've been let down before
I've been let down
I've been let down before
I've been let down
But I've been waiting around for you
Where did you go?
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Came home to an empty house
Non other lights were on
But when I flipped the switch
And saw a bunch of broken shit
I knew another fight went off
It seem to happen every evening
And the only reason is
I was too young
I have asthma
I wear glasses
Going spast' coughing up a lot
Last week I had pneumonia
From breathing in still air
And the atmosphere here was always tense
And I'm convinced this place was full of demon
In a house full of broken adults
And I'm confused when they say they're just talking
When it's [?] my dad wooped my mother
And in retaliation she always leave

[Chorus]
I've been let down before
I've been let down
I've been let down before
I've been let down
But I've been waiting around for you
Where did you go?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
So I crept up the stairs to the hallway
Where I saw mom's clothes on the floor
Where she at?
Don't know when she'll be back
Maybe if I drew a map I could find her
She could explain the reason
But there's a part of me
That doesn't really wanna know
It smells funny up here
And I can see there's blood all over the floor
Oh Lord have mercy help me out
Somebody is anybody there?
God is nowhere in the sky
And I can't even seem to find the corpses
Thoughts of revenge came rushing in
My only company my salvation
I ran away tears streamin' down my face
I'll never forgive this day

[Chorus]
I've been let down before
I've been let down
I've been let down before
I've been let down
But I've been waiting around for you
Where did you go?
Yeah

[Verse 3]
I mastered being a bastard son
Daddy's gun, smoking blocking out my son
Leaving [?] of memories
To cover my loss of parents
Why's it I gotta defend the devil I once called my parent
Blew out my candles after age of two
Age four five six wanted to slit my wrist
Dilute my blood and toxins in Daniels drink
And in his bullshit existence how I got in it
There were no days that I
Didn't yell or scream
Still a parent in my dreams
I was dreaming what it would be like to
Have a normal parent
Be a normal child
Not awake from dreams where I shot him and smiled
I fucking hate my father
I thought I built a bridge over that troubled water
I guess I didn't
Use the pen and the gun
And the ink for ammunition
Shot the motherfucker now I know what I'm missing

[Chorus]
I've been let down before
I've been let down
I've been let down before
I've been let down
But I've been waiting around for you
Where did you go?

I've been let down before
I've been let down
I've been let down before
I've been let down
But I've been waiting around for you
Where did you go?
