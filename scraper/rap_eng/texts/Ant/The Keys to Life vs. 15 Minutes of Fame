[Pilot over PA]
"Folks I know you're all dying to know how long--
I cannot answer that now. We're gonna have the maintenance technicians come over
And take a look at it and uh once that's done, then we'll give you an estimate
I'd say it's probably at least uh 15 minutes or so."

[Verse 1]
It's like all of Franklin Avenue now sleeps upon my chest (my chest)
I've used cigarette butts and looseleaf to build my nest (build my nest)
Did I mention I appreciate the way you treat your guests? (guess not)
But I'm not really convinced when you say that you're impressed (hell no)
The line between MC and comedian gets a little thinner (little thinner)
Now it's nothing but roughage for lunch and punchlines for dinner (feed me)
I've tried to open the blinds to let in some sunshine
Wound the watch 'til it broke all in hopes of stopping the time

[Hook]
The key broke off in the ignition
Hopping if I wandered off through my thoughts wishing
Hoping this could be for you, but it is for me
Patiently I stay busy, I wait, I see (X2)

It's the sure shot (X6)

Zih Zih Zih Zih Zih

[Verse 2]
See it's simple (simple), it's not that I want to make it ripple (ripple)
But I feel I'm only being civil (civil)
When I sit back and giggle like the rest as the rhythm manifests
I'm stressed (stressed), but most of 'em would never guess (never guess)
That I'm closing in upon the crest
Why? Cause I think it'd be best for who? To hide the mess from who?
It's all true (it's all true), not good, but I know it'll do (it'll do)
Still trying to reach the kid in you
So I may continue to find why this child proves so wild
I smile (smile), tired, I walked a thousand miles (miles)
Wired over the thoughts I've dialed (dialed)
Inspired by the monsters, the files of life full of stars and stripes

[Hook]

(Chorus End)
If you wanna sleep with me and talk about existence
We'll need more than 15 minutes
I'll tell you what, let's forget about the fame
Push pause on the game and get to know each other by our real names
If you wanna sleep with me and talk about existence
We'll need more than 15 minutes
I'll tell you what, let's forget about the fame
Push pause on the game and get to know each other by our first names
If you wanna sit with me and talk about existence
We'll need more than 15 minutes
I'll tell you what, let's forget about the fame
Push pause on the game... What the fuck's your name?
