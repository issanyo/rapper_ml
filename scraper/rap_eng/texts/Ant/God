[Intro: Slimmy B]
I just pray to God, I just pray to God nigga
I just pray to God, I just pray to God nigga
I just pray to God

[Verse: Slimmy B]
I just pray to God one day I see a milli'
I just pray to God one day I cop a Bentley
I just pray to God that them angels stay wit' me
I just pray to God that them suckers don't get me
I just pray to God that I see another day
I just pray to God that the devil stay away
I just pray to God that my brother beat that case
I just pray to God I ain't gotta use this K
I just pray to God that they don't try to rob
'Cause if they try to rob then a nigga gon' die
And when a nigga die then them suckers might slide
And if them suckas slide, choppa bullets gonna fly
I just pray to God I see my son become a man
I just pray to God I stay runnin' up these bands
I got real love for my baby, not pretend
Was with me from the start, gon' be wit' me in the end
I just pray to God fake love stay away
Actin' like you fuck with me, fake love in my face
Where I live it ain't safe, niggas dyin' everyday
What a time to be alive, got me feelin' like Drake
Too much on my plate, hell no I can't stop
Put my all this rap 'cause it's all a nigga got
What I paid for the watch, coulda drove off the lot
And if you ain't finna squeeze, hell no you can't rock
I do the shit for Pop, yeah I do it for my son
I do it for my mom, yeah I do it for these hunds
I do this shit for Bruce, that's my brother, that's my blood
He that nigga that I really want to be when I was young
Niggas said I couldn't do it, had to get it out the mud
Now everywhere I go, niggas sayin' I'm they cuz
I do it for the Crest, yeah I do it for my thugs
Niggas do it for the clout, I swear I do it for the love
I'm still in the V, still in these streets
Still in the hood haulin' stones straight from keys
Still wit' the pop outs, still wit' the beef
And I still be hoopin' you could still catch these B's
Livin' out my dream I swear to God this shit amazin'
But it didn't happen overnight, it took patience
At auntie's house I was sleepin' in the basement
Now it's CLS550 when I lane switch, bitch!
Livin' in the jungle, everyday it's a struggle
Body after body, everyday it's a couple
My man took from me, ran off and said, "Fuck you"
He call me, say he need me, I still got him, 'cause I love dude
Bite the hand that feed you, that just somethin' that you don't do
XD-45, I'll show you what this gun do
Tryna be a thug, thinks it's fun if you want to
Niggas dyin' everyday, who the fuck the shit fun to?
Bein' in and out my son's life is what I won't do
Moms did it all, that's who all my love go to
Pops was around but only did what he want to
Not what he's supposed to, as a man that's what you don't do
Needed school clothes, you was never there to go to
Birthdays and Christmas, you was never there to go to
Couldn't give no help on hard times I was goin' through
I love your ass to death but don't think I ever owe you, nigga!
