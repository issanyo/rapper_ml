A young One like Me
There's so many things I've got to see
Cause I'm going and going
And showing the beauty in Me
And if all the people in this whole wide world
Could live in harmony
Consider what that would mean to

Chorus:
A young One like Me
I've got to be happy; got to be free
The rumors and schemers
Like feemers and dreamers of quality
And if all the weapons of war could be dumped in the great blue sea
How wonderful that would be to a young One like Me

Everyday I'll be playing in the rain
In the rain, in the rain
In the rain
But that doesn't say I won't be serious
Serious, serious
Little things I do make me kind of mischievous
Mischievous, mischievous while I pray
The love would like me along the way
And then I think
Hear what I'm saying; hear what I'm saying

Repeat Chorus
