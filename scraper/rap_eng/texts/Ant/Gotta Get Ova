[Intro]
Left a long time ago
Left a long time ago
Left a long time ago

[Chorus]
I gotta get ova, I gotta get over you
Someway, somehow
I gotta get ova, I gotta get over you
Someway, someway, somehow

[Verse 1]
Stages play
And I swear this bar's a cage
Everyone next something rose
And I'm awake but I feel
Like my eyes are closed

Lot of my friends
Ain't really my friends
They smile in my face
They only pretend
Like it only depend
On my own
Only depend, on my own

Emancipate from all the fake
From all the hate
From all the shame
All the time that I do waste
In bad relations, situations
Got me sayin'
I'm awake and I'm aware
Insecure, I'm pretty sure
Pretty lost, I'll find my way
Vince Chalet, I'll make it there
And I'll say

[Chorus]
I gotta get ova, I gotta get over you
Someway, somehow
I gotta get ova, I gotta get over you
Someway, someway, somehow

[Verse 2]
Nothin' pacifies
Can a lie pass me by
No more cryin', no more tears
No more dyin', no more fear

You gotta feel what you feel when you feel it
But I don't got nothin' more to feel
I feel so low before, I feel so down before

To know what I've been missin'
Damn for sure you miss it
The sun will come up for me
I wore my heart in your sleeve
The dark is all that I see
And I just want to be free
And I don't wanna stay here
I think it's time that I leave
And I

[Chorus]
I gotta get ova, I gotta get over you
Someway, somehow
I gotta get ova, I gotta get over you
Someway, someway, somehow

[Outro]
Sad all the time
Why are you trying to be
Why are you trying to be
Why are you trying to be

Sad all the time
Why are you trying to be
Why are you trying to be
Why are you trying to be

Sad all the time
Why are you trying to be
Why are you trying to be
Why are you trying to be
