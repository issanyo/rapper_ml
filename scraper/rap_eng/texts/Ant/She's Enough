[Hook: Slug]
If she want it
I'm gonna give it up
If she running low
I'm gonna fill her cup
If it spill, chill, I'mma clean it up
I'll be right here cause she's enough
If she needed the money
I would stick you up
If she's getting bored
I do some different stuff
Don't need anything just keep it up
I'll be right here cause she's enough

[Verse 1: Slug]
She wanna do the damn thing and I'm on her side
She opened up the wings and she gonna fly
She got no time for the fuss and fight
She does it right, she loves her life
She the one to put the kick in the drums
She the hot stove top when the winter comes
She hits the run, she can lift a ton
She gon stick to the job and get it done
She hop out and push if the motors dead
She gotta keep it moving with no regret
She's up in my head, but never oversteps
She let me know when it's time for us to go to bed
She's my lady case closed
She want a baby so I gave her one of those
Belly getting big, look at the kid grow
She want a song so I wrote one and it goes

[Hook: Slug]

[Verse 2: Slug]
She the one that you wanna grow old with
She gotta touch it
She want to hold it
She gets focused
She's got the dopest kiss
She don't need you to tell her already knows it is
She makes me laugh till I'm on that floor
She don't ask why I adore
She like to travel so we explore
Shes seen everything want to see some more
She the opposite of selfish
She love house pets, she wants to help kids
She pulled me out my shell
Fit tight like a belt now the suckers get jealous
Believe it don't get sweeter
She gonna make me sweat like fever
She wanna eat so we went to domingis
She want a ring, got me measuring her fingers

[Hook: Slug]

[Outro: Slug]
Got me here, whatcha do now is up to you now
Got me here, whatcha do now is up to you
Got me here, whatcha do now is up to you now
Got me here, whatcha do now is up to you
