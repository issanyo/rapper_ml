[Verse 1: Dapper Dave]

The light from the night reflecting off her tears
Couple shots of Vodka, 3 To 4 Beers
Now tell me what you fear?
Is it life itself?
You've shed so many tears, that you could fill a well
Like used to get A's
Now I get These (D's)

[Hook]
Well that's just me
Well, Well thats just me
Well that's just me
Well, Well thats just me

[Verse 2: Dapper Dave]

Rappin' like my test scores, so I guess am Average
Rebounding all these beats, like I'm playing for the Mavericks
I ain't go not job, so it's "Never Stacking Cabbage"
Me on the beat
Man you know it's so savage
Trying to be the best in the whole rap game
Surpassing all the lames
Showing no shame
So all you rappers with your so called "Diffrent Rap" I don't want your change

[Hook]
Well that's just me
Well, Well thats just me
Well that's just me
Well, Well thats just me
