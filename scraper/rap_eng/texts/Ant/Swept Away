[Sample from Beastie Boys "The New Style"]
Let me clear my throat - Kick it over here baby pop
And let all the fly skimmies, feel the beat...mmm drop

Boom!
It's the way she moves that broom thats got me consumed
And it ain't' got nothin' to do with the sweepin'
It's the look on her face, that's got me displaced
Plus the fact that she's probably got no clue I'm peepin'
She's deep into routine
Cleanin off the sidewalk
Infront of the shop she works
1:15 am, me parked in the car
On the street, maybe 30 feet from the spot she sweeps
Emotions achin', who is this human?
And why's she chewin' my attention
The action, unaware, innocent, purely accident
And whom I askin this?
I'm alone, in the passenger seat of this [this part is bleeped out]
Awaitin' my companion, but damn man, she's got me distracted
And it's not just the fact that she's attractive
It's the whole kit-n-kabootle
From the look on her face, to her taste in shoes, to the way she moves
It inspires me to sit and doodle, so
While I write
She wipes down the tagged up picnic tables outside of the [bleeped out]
It's missin not a spot
And here I sit once again, with a pen
And a desire to be entirely lost in a world of them ..
