[Chorus]
Can it fall?
And if we lost it all
I cannot find my way
Can it be
That we're more than what we see?
I cannot stop this pain

[Verse 1]
I'm broken down so very low
Ay-ay-ay-ay so am I-I-I
And the winter time is all the time I got to grow
And I know it so miserable and cold
And I recognize the disappointment in myself
I pushed everyone away so I could be alone myself
It's a cold world, it's a new day
Don't know if it will get better evidently got no better and
I don't know what you could say
To make me wanna get up and start my days
Put everything I had into the wrong place
Gave it all away so I gotta walk away
I don't need you now but you should know
That I given everything that I own
I still wish you well
Everyone we love, becomes a part of us
And I wanna say

[Chorus]
Can it fall
And if we lost it all
I cannot find my way
Can it be
That we're more than what see?
I cannot stop this pain

[Verse 2]
There's nothing left to run from
And there's no where left to hide
There is nobody left I can rely on
On my own
I ran for a long time
Trying to find my way home, ghost hollow in my scope
Leave me alone, I'm only human, flesh and blood
Gotta surrender but I keep on holding on to this grudge

[Chorus]
Can it fall?
And if we lost it all
I cannot find my way
Can it be
That we're more than what see?
I cannot stop this pain
