[ Hook ] (2X)
Man, you win some, lose some
They run the gamut from hilarious to gruesome
In my life I done caught some and threw some
And I done been in some shit
But this is one that I will never forget

[ VERSE 1 ]
Testosterone-filled hallway confrontation spectacle
Time to see who got the testicles
I'm not the type to holler, "What you wanna do then?"
Hands parallel to my shoulders, I keep it movin
There's one thing I hate is for another man to take control
Of a situation, you don't want me to play the role
I'm in my element on Front Street, I love the spot light
Bringin an audience to diss me is just not right
I told him, "Listen stupid, I know what you're here to do
But we're not gonna do it
This is a movement that I'm part of it
You're lucky I'm a righteous blackman"
And you thought I had issues now, really had em back then
I turned my back with the anti-climatic spitefulness
That's the worst type of diss
And I stepped off, adolescent, passive aggressive
Jesus Christ superstar to send the world a message
And there stood little man soft dick in hand
Wonderin "What the fuck just happened?" Mad enough to kill a man
I turn the corner like as long as he ain't pullin a gun
I'd rather catch a ass-whippin than run

I put them out there bad too, really they had to
I turned around, they runnin right directly at me, they looked mad, too
A half a minute felt like a half an hour
When he got close enough I stuck him once for black power
All three bombed on me, started swingin me around
Hollerin, "Get him down, get him down!"
I'm like fuck that, y'all not gettin me on the linoleum
So three white boys can start stompin only one
They didn't hold back at all
They started bangin my head against a steel locker like a freakin racket ball
Grill was all busted, the locker was rusted
And when my face hit it it split my bicuspid
They spilled blood on my 'Boys N The Hood Increase the Peace' t-shirt
Now, isn't that symbolic?
I came to school a week later with a eye full of stitches
And I held my head higher than pictures
They lookin at me like, "Yeah y'all done fucked me up
What you think that's a thing that's gonna shut me up?"
Shit, nope, still swaggerin, still battle rappin
And still not givin em the satisfaction of bein mad
