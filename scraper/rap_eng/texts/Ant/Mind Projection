[Verse 1: Big Mac Zac]

Yeah, the name's Big Mac Zac
I never really thought that I'd featured on this track
I always thought that rapping would be like getting hooked on crack
And thats when good ole' Mangus came and gave me a smack
(smack)
Oh, you thought I was done?
I did too, but now my mind's on a run
So I'm spitting this shit, like its the last you'll ever hear of me
Probably the most famous I'll ever fucking be
It's going to be the most attention that I've ever fucking had
It might sound like a lie, but nah it's really fucking sad
(cries)
Now I got a crush on this girl, but I don't like she likes me back
Probably thinks I'm a loser, can't you cut me some slack?
I'm new to this shit, both the drinking and the talking
If I gave you my shoes, my life would be a bitch to walk in
Speaking of bitches, lets get back to this girl
My bro Angel had a rager and I think she saw me hurl
Am I done for good? Does this mean I'm out?
I'm all out of tears, like I'm in a fucking drought
But fuck that shit, lets get back to the good times
Staying up all night, just to get them good rhymes
Damn, I'm a lyrical pedophile
You know, cause I just molested the shit out of this beat
Now put that shit back on repeat
BMZ, out

[Verse 2: Mangus]

They say
Hip-hop is dead, Imma resurrect it
They say I'm fat, my self esteem effected
818s walk by, you know I get erected
Fuck Obama man he should of never got elected
I perfected, rejection, at a young age
Thots read the cover, not the pages
I is, a fucking maniac, more like a brainiac, fucking egomaniac
Thoughts hectic but never respected
Third eye opened, my minds infected
Bro don't stress it, pineal dissected
Yeah I said dissected
I'm directed looking for direction
Hits bigger than Brit Recht's tits
Hands in the air, I'm throwing fits
Greedy white America, grease in their mitts
I'm amidst, people that say they don't give a shit
But oops when the shit hits the fan
And oop shit dawg, you don't got a plan
You get arrested, and no one objected
You sit your ass in a jail cell and hopelessly reflect it
You call your mom's cell and start to confess it
Like damn, I didn't mean to get a DUI
But fuck it, like my friends, they really needed a ride
But hey, tell dad at least I got some head
No mom, I didn't drag her drunk ass to bed
I just gave her two xans and dragged her by the hand
But I was too gone, so my thought train got jammed, damn

This has been your boy, M-A-N-G-U-S Mangus, B-M-Z Big Mac Zac
Yeah, we outchea, Mind Projection
