The spoken word
The spoken word is a tool
As a sculptor uses a hammer and chisel
So goes language
Letters, syllables, sounds
These are the tools of a poet
The sound wave is our medium
The tongue is our paintbrush
Each movement a brushstroke on a canvas
Every verse, every sentence, every word
Paints a picture
Canvases tear, sculptures erode, paint dilutes
Sound fades
But words
Words transcend time
Words are the immortal medium
Words are the key
That unlocks immortality for a mortal
John Lennon, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, Kurt Cobain, 2Pac Shakur
They live
They have achieved immortality
Sound fades, but words never perish
The power of the spoken word is limitless
Words can corrupt, words can uplift
Words can destroy, words can protect
Words can ruin, words can benefit
Words are infinite
Hip-Hop is perhaps spoken word in it's truest, most beautiful form
We are musicians, we are artists
We are poets, we are emcees
And this is what we do...
