[Prof: Verse 1]
I learned at a real young age if I sat down a pouted, I'd be there for days
Smile big when they hold that shit against you, sad people can't imagine what I've been through
I won't apologize for being positive, I'll no longer explain myself to novices
So pardon me if I wanna crack a joke, rather than sit around and point at holes in boat
Put it on my grave that I went out laughing, dancing, only way to celebrate the madness
My whole life's been a ball of shit, at dinner eating popcorn like this is all I get?
I'm a one of a kind bright mind, I am beautiful, complex, shine let me shine
When I'm not laughing I'm crying, like when I'm not living I'm dying, mother fucker I'm trying

[Prof: Chorus 2x]
I don't need permission to smile, it's mine for the rest of my life
I'm me till death do us part, don't tell me what's right

[Prof: Verse 2]
I don't need to sit and pout to justify intelligence
Or talk about how bad I've had it to be relevant
Toured the whole country with a hole in my back
And they talked about how dedication is something I lack
Wintertime, poppin' pills like they were vitamins
Wondering to myself if I'll ever walk right again
I choose to be happy, I will not act sad for you, it's what I have to do
I got the wild wild horses, I refuse to be cautious
I'll take both feet then I'll jump in, ain't getting used to no office
Should I be more pessimistic, less misfit, if I refuse to comply I'm a dipshit? If they're mad at you then that's a good sign
They'll do anything to keep you from a good time

[Prof: Chorus 2x]
I don't need permission to smile, it's mine for the rest of my life
I'm me till death do us part, don't tell me what's right

(2X)
This is what I do best, ain't gunna apologize or watch my steps
They say I got pride, it's on my breath, well pardon me for thinking there's not much left

Don't tell me how to breathe
Don't tell me where to run
Don't tell me when to smile
Don't tell me when it's done
Don't tell me what to see
Don't tell me who to love
Don't tell me who to be
Don't tell me when it's done
