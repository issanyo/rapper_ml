[Intro]
In about three second a teacher will begin to speak

[Verse 1]
When your stock is low and the offer's slow
You're the farthest from your hottest
You must believe in you, yes even you
Have potential to be the largest
Lift yourself on up and don't hold others back
Because crabs often end up cracked

[Refrain]
When we begin we start from scratch
And when we end we should know how to act

[Hook]
Like that, like that
They can't take away your gifts
Only you can take away your gifts
Like that and like this
They can't steal all of your time
Only you can waste all of your time
Better me on mine, nobody makes me but me
And only I can make me weaker
I've been listening close to my intuition
Cause I am my best teacher

[Verse 2]
When your stock is high and the offers fly
You done earned this and it's deserved
Keep a level head, could be trouble ahead
Enjoy the moment thought, it's your turn
Have a humble soul but never dim your shine
In other words just be genuine

[Refrain]
When we begin we start from scratch
And when we end we should know how to act

[Hook]
Like that, like that
They can't take away your gifts
Only you can take away your gifts
Like that and like this
They can't steal all of your time
Only you can waste all of your time
Better me on mine, nobody makes me but me
And only I can make me weaker
I've been listening close to my intuition
Cause I am my best teacher

[Bridge]
We let the music play
And let the music play
Let the music play
Let the music play
If this is all I know
Let the music play
Let the music play
We let the music play

[Verse 3]
If this is all I know
It's how cycles flow
This is ancient, rhythm [?]
That which comes around goes right back around
Can't fight currents so embrace this
Money comes and goes and never cures at all
To reach the top you may have to fall

[Refrain]
When we begin we start from scratch
And when we end we should know how to act

[Hook]
Like that, like that
They can't take away your gifts
Only you can take away your gifts
Like that and like this
They can't steal all of your time
Only you can waste all of your time
Better me on mine, nobody makes me but me
And only I can make me weaker
I've been listening close to my intuition
Cause I am my best teacher

[Verse 4]
So when the people leave and there's peace to breathe
Listen closely to your own speech
That is the realest tune if you feel in tune
You will sing this song mostly
Life can beat you down but get on up again
Everything we learn makes us better men

[Refrain]
When we begin we start from scratch
And when we end we should know how to act

[Hook]
Like that, like that
They can't take away your gifts
Only you can take away your gifts
Like that and like this
They can't steal all of your time
Only you can waste all of your time
Better me on mine, nobody makes me but me
And only I can make me weaker
I've been listening close to my intuition
Cause I am my best teacher
