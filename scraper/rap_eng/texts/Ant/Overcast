(Intro)
(We did an album, with no stopping
Now were working on another one)

[Verse 1: Spawn]
Shit gets tense well before I henceforth
Use common sense and don't bring your ass up north
Built a tall fence, so high you can't see in
Tilt your defense, bitch, you ain't hard you just pretend
The force much too big, so you could never conquer
Fuck you up, kid did, then once more for the encore
I'm much more emcee than you could ever fucking be
And you thought it was you, but I control your destiny
The A-N-T lace a track for murder
Spawn sets the attack with words, the insert blurs the vision
Time for the decision, thumbs up? No thumbs down
You shoulda' known it was us
When you felt the shaking, ground making
Sound waves that pave ways for us to go
It's not who you know, it's what you know
So let it go, I got a lot of angles
Too much for simple minds to count
Yo, you wanna tango? You better off and you just bounce
The last ounce of breath is now left your body
Life now past tense cause your rhyme skills are sloppy
You couldn't stop me, that's what it comes down to
You can't out-rock me, b-boy, muthafucker old school

[Verse 2: Slug]
Grabbed by the shoulders
Ripped in half like the broken flyers to your show
Told ya not to try to flow
Not cause your weak, it's cause your don't freq. the speak
With any type of technique from deep inside
I peeped your vibe, it seems to thrive off the shit of the minute
But I've come to stop the cries, and let my feces fossilize
And when it's hard as a granite rock, rocker was classic as Planet Rock rock
I grabbed your flask of thoughts to make the planet stop stop
Understand the understated, cause it's unnecessary to undermine the underestimated
Underrated, under one nation, of underachievers
Who undercut by fucking under the table, under the nose of unbelievers
With that in mind, how do you find the time to dislike me?
Bitch, give me the mike and I'm a gut you like a Pisces
What's fucked up, is I don't even know you
But we got a track left to kill so I'm a show you
And you can show your whole crew
(Atmosphere) I don't care if you know me or you hate me
There's something in Minneapolis and I think it's starting to spread
Atmosphere (The mass of air surrounding the Earth's surface)
Ayo, see you on the next one, thank you for the purchase
