[Verse 1: ANT !]
ALL I KNOW IS IM SO MOTHER FUCKING FOCUS
COMING FROM A CITY WHERE IS HARD TO GET NOTICE
YA AINT SHIT IS WHAT A LAME NIGGA TOLD US
BUT WE JUST TRY TO DO OUR THINK ME CANT CONTROL IT
MY EYES HAVE BEEN OPENED
SIGHT IS GETTING CLEARER
I SEE EVERYONE ONE THAT I MEET IS NOT A REAL NIGGA
COUPLE TIMES I TOLD TRELL DONT CRY FOR SPILLED LIQUOR
THEN WE MET MOLLY BUT WE AINT POPPING THEM PILLS NIGGA

YEA

THESE ARE MY THOUGHTS FOR THE SECOND
RIGHT ABOUT NOW MY MINDS IS ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
BOARD WITH THE GAMES , BUT THIS THE 4 BROS CONNECTION
I DO IT FOR THE TEAM AND THAT ON THE SONG IM PENNING

UH YEA

NO HOOK
ASSITING MY MY NIGGAS FROM MY HOOD , NO LOOK
THE STREET COLD MANY NIGGAS IS SO SHOOK
I WONDER WHAT WE'D DO IF THERE WASNT NO BOOK
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE OR WHAT WOULD YOU POST
AND IF I COULD HAVE A BAD BITCH RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD BE DOPE
WHAT IN MY LUNGS RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD BE SMOKE
FEEL LIKE IM STEAMING SO I PASS IT TO THE BRO
