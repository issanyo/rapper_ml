[Verse 1]
These warehouse wages
Kill the ends introduction
Man I should have schooled it up
When I was younger should have stuck to plan
Always had the dreams of bein' more self assertive
And my kids a teenager now he needs the health insurance
So break my body
Break break my soul down
Just another zombie walkin' blindly through your ghost town
Pull up to the bar to politic and tap the power
Ain't nobody really all that jolly at your happy hour
But I don't want to go home yet
So I'm gonna talk to my cigarette
And that television set
It doesn't matter what brand or station
Anything to take away from the current situation

[Refrain]
No overtime pay, no holiday
Months behind on everything but the lottery
Winter around the corner guaranteein' that my car dies
Wifey havin' trouble tryin' to juggle both the part times
My cup ain't close to filled up
We tryin' to build up so we can have enough
And when I finally get the color
There won't be nothing left to paint on
A friend of mine tried to kill himself to the same song

[Verse 2]
My better half is mad at making magic out of canned goods
My tax bracket status her questionin' my manhood
My shorty got caught smoking weed at a concert
And if I smack em everybody treats me like a monster
My neighbors ain't doin' much better
And we making competition instead of stickin' together
Can't save no nest egg, in fact this nest is rented
In fact that rent is late, wait
The money ain't here the raise ain't comin'
Just me and my son and that crazy woman
And those bartenders this whole fuckin' country
Got everybody swallowin' that lunch meat
Maybe we can speed up the process
Kill me in my thirties in the name of progress
Put me in the dirt and then change the topic
Some time it seems like the only way to stop it
Contemplate my departure date
Doesn't take a lot to get a lot of us to talk this way
Take a shot at me that's all I'm obligated for
Apparently my only guarantee is a walk away

The only guarantee in life is a life worth dyin' for
Cause death don't wait for no one
Sittin' on your front door
The only guarantee in life is a life worth dyin' for
Cause death don't wait for no one
Sittin' on your front door
