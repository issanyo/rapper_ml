[Hook] {x2}
I'm trying to live now
Instead of paranoid, ready for the breakdown
Yelling "Get down, give me your shit now"
For all the times in the street I was so foul

"Walking on sunshine" {x4}

[Verse One]
What do we say when the lights get burnt out?
It's been a good one, fuck it I'm turnt out
In a casket, suited up
Cremate [?] please
Learn from the O.G.'s
Not to fuck with police cause they phony
Learned about money cause I tricked it
Learned about credit when a nigga got evicted
How can you tell when it's yo' time?
No glitter in the eye, no sunshine
Believe in something that's greater
Believe in myself cause I gotta get paper
Believe in G.O.D
Targets me so I'll always be free
Pleasure on Earth is right here
Is it a dream or stuck in a nightmare?
Hell's right here and it's so hot
In a form of prisons and dope spots
Make life what you maked it
It ain't fair every time so make it

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
I'm trying to live life to the utmost
Not frozen in the cut like comatose
No 9 to 5
Write in my own book how I'ma stay alive
Never sold cocaine
But I did weed
Gangbanging
No felonies
Accepted things a little different
But things that I fucked up on made me different
When I had my daughter I was tripping
Fresh outta, some facility for tripping
Had to get my act straight
Had to play government like everyday's tax day
Made up with most of my enemies
The others wanna see me dead or up in the street
Wanna see pops before I cash out
See I love you even though your ass mashed out
Left us for broke
That's why I gotta see my children grow
Stay neck deep
In the community
If I don't I'm as worse as the enemy

[Hook]
