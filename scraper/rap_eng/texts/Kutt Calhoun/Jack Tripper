Come and knock on my
Come and knock on my
Come and knock on my
Come and knock on my door

[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
All I need is 2 bad bitches, a bottle of Remi ma
Mack Maine in the air till they follow me to the car
Cash money with a bag of this molly to kick it off
Now that's what you call a Nicki Minaj
Lettin them gargle the dicks like watching a game of tennis
Gripping it like a rocket they back and forth with the penis
The darker one on my balls she told me they call her venus
The other one was her sister named big booty Serena
One nigga, two sprung bitches, Stevie J style
Give you my reality so much you wanna hate by
These real housewifes of Atlanta while keep the script
But if you ever wanna find out the reason they mini leach just

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Come and knock on my
Come and knock on my
Come and knock on my
Come and knock on my door

Jack Tripper, Jack Jack Tripper

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
This one bitch call me her baby boy she like my hustling flow
Name Tiraji when she ride me it be subtle and slow
She say she not easily broken but she lovin the stroke
And got a smoking ace partner who can certainly go
Told me the pussy so good it make a nigga leave his wife
Her name Alisha get a piece of her and it will change your life
Shit thick, butt mix like piano black and white keys
Took off all her clothes and told a nigga , eat me right please!
Think I didn't lick on that pussy till she screamed
Now she fallin, I told Tiraji y'all the perfect team
But I never got to hit because a nigga caught ballin
Don't trip, round 2, we can finish this up tomorrow
All you gotta do is

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Come and knock on my
Come and knock on my
Come and knock on my
Come and knock on my door

Jack Tripper, Jack Jack Tripper

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
This chick Shay she like it when I play with her butt
Ground cinnamon when I'm swimming in her flavor of love
Got a friend name Megan , her pussy is so good
Lips so big, she can suck the water out of wood
Together they Halle Berry cause my monster balls
Making gaga with my swordfish in their monster jaws
But they barely get along so it's a constant pause
The way they fight over my dick is like a Swanson brawl
They all love me and I love that they love women
And know that there's a model when I follow when I'm with 'em
If one ain't enough and 2's a crowd
Then 3's company and that's the only way I get down
