[Intro: Tech N9ne]
From the deepest darkest part of misery
Never seen before
Never heard before
Talent beyond this world
Bow down for royalty
Tech N9ne the King
Krizz Kali the Czar
Kutt Calhoun the Prince
Too much to comprehend

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
It's not quite enough for me
But anyone with eyes can see

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Too much for ya
Too much
Too much for ya
Too much
Too much for ya
Too much
Too much for ya
Too much
Too much for ya

[Tech N9ne]
Prepare for the ending
This is the pinnacle
All hail the king
Tech N9ne

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Ain't nobody better, we comin' clever than ever
Goin' head up with competitors and levelin' 'em
We put 'em through the shredder
We got the lever to sever any brethren
Who steppin' with the devil in 'em
I'm sick of everybody thinkin' they ready for the work of a killa
And feelin' they ill and not sayin' a thing
Gotta give it up when the skill is incredible
Death is inevitable if you got trouble obeying the king
I guess when I bust I'm too much for ya
I cuss when I must I'm too rough for ya
Tecca N9na when I'm flowin' it's a rush for ya
Other rappers on the planet you a customer
'Cause you buy it and bite on me put your recorder right on me
'Cause you really ain't the shit and you stuck in debris
Now the people got the light on me I'm about to fight on the mic
And you knowin' ain't nobody fuckin' with me
Automatically haters be mad at me
When I be rippin' it niggas get to trippin'
'Cause I'm livin' it up
Got the industry in the palm of my hand
And I promise I can’t offend a fan
When I say I'm not givin' a fuck
I'm 'bout the music and doin' it, when the people they ruin it
When they miss it it be drivin' me crazy
I'm different and people they call me evil and devil
I'ma let 'em see the level of animal it made me
'Cause I don't give a fuck, I just bust your crew up
Leave 'em in the dust, and must chuck the deuce up
N9na, Krizz and Kutt we upchuck the new stuff
Never can ya touch or crush us we TOO MUCH

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
Why do we even do it when you don't get it?
It's like beatin' a dead fuckin' horse
Constantly givin' you elite shit
And only a handful of you get it

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Too much for ya
Too much
Too much for ya
Too much
Too much for ya
Too much
Too much for ya
Too much
Too much for ya
Too much
Too much for ya
Too much
Too much for ya
Too much
Too much for ya
Too much

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
And I can paint a picture of words
So if you understand what you heard

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Sayin’ that you want it
I’m thinkin’ that we way too much for ya
Settin’ the bar that we 'bout to raise too much for ya
Dolby and digital gotta pay some bucks for tha
Clarity and the intricate spray (Bladdah! Bladdah!)
However they want it man I'ma hit 'em with the - bid'ness
Blood - living could be the reason you b-b-begun trippin'
A lot of forgotten too busy rottin’ in mud rivas, was niggas
Who got it twitted thinkin’ they thug niggas
Belvee and Mountain Dew, outta my bodily
City of fountains you think you hard but you hardly
Compare to a rare brotha
I swear there no nan nuhdah
Can weather a liz-thiz-izzle weapon like Dan Glover
(Dangerous with this flow)
Come and Kutt you like I'ma
(Insane, a beast in beast mode)
And know you fucking with the
(Mangled beast, the sheets show)
And I'll be motherfucking
(Damn the pieces he sold)
I'm too much for ya

[Tech N9ne]
I don't give a fuck I just bust ya crew up
Leave 'em in the dust and must chuck the deuce up
N9na, Krizz and Kutt we upchuck the new stuff
Never can you touch or crush we too much N9na
Kali and Kutt, ain't nobody, fuckin' with us!
