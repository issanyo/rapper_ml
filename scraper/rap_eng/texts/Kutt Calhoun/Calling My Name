[Verse 1]
Is this what this shit is all about can someone tell me
Why these blood, sweat and tears, years I give seem so unhealthy
Like seeing the beast unmasked for the first time so unveiling
Yet it's heartful
It went from thoughtful
To feeling heartbroke
And so its melan
Thinking about being on the stage with them nigga's
Sweating giving you whatever you paid for them tickets
No it is not another act today that just give it
To you like in the way we do makes it exquisite
Making this hittits
Taking this trippits
Goin' on the internet and facing this critics
Saying "his sickic" is great to hear
But all the compliments it ain't paying me shitic
Its like this music thing is my drug habit and your making me kick it
But on the other hand me having to go without it would make me get sinic?
Gather you to prevent that all it would take is a little bit of basic incentive
Cause I dont think know that without your support a career would flaking and finish
So take a quick minute
Put your whole damn face in this business
See what I go through on a daily when numbers don't add up and take a quick visit
Though the mind where patience was given', find the grave and pray for this nigga
Got my whole life written in pencil and all your doing is erasing this livin'

[Hook: Barbara Ward]
Said I don't hear, don't hear you calling my name
Said I don't hear, don't hear you calling my name
With everyone in the world to see in me and I don't know who's to blame
Cause I don't hear, don't hear you calling my name

[Verse 2]
If I just happen to stop it would be catastrophic
But since this matter of topic
Lets get back to options
I could just get a job and get right back to docking
Move in a wack apartment and confine myself into a one room shack is hardly
What can happen?
I wouldn't make enough to provide for the family without the rapping
But your asuming
That we get paid good
Cause we keep touring
But in actuality
You dont know about this game, nigga you dont know about this rain
You dont know about the six kids that I have to feed nigga when the stomach got pains
Its so insane
Cause I'm making a hit they come and takin, it all away
And before I consolidate
Nothing to salvage, from hearing my daughter say
"there goes the gifts for the holidays"
But we all OK
Is what I hear, when I know its just words of comfort
Is what I fear, if I own nothing else I know one thing
If you don't buy records, I don't eat
If I don't eat, then its time to go and count on streets
If I don't leave, my 7 to a jail house cell then my destiny is 6 feet hollow deep
And thats all I need
A Rest In Peace for poor old me
I'm hearing that everybody love me
Boy you got a real good way of showing me

[Hook: Barbara Ward]
Said I don't hear, don't hear you calling my name
Said I don't hear, don't hear you calling my name
With everyone in the world to see in me and I don't know who's to blame
Cause I don't hear, don't hear you calling my name

[Verse 3]
If I could go back to when all of this happened and start when rappin was innocent
Where niggas was happy you did it a rally for love when streets were replenishin'
But those are my sentiments
Now the shit is so menacin'
Venom in many men
Give them an in
And they would go in your window
And load right up under your nose
In a minute man
How can I get it back
Im too addicted with
Signing this autographs
Taking this pictures with
People I never knew
Its in my ligaments
Im just compelled to do
Whats in my spirit when
Everything is genuine
Hand me that sliver pen
I get strait with you
Right after this gentlemen
Tired as fuck
But I'm full of adrenaline
Cause I just dont know
When I can do it again
Fresh off the stage
After giving you energy
Best show you ever seen
Everyone witnessed it
Im so committed
Its highly ridiculous
Song after song at 310%
Mingle with kids on the floor
Right before we go on
And that's so they know I'm official with
Keeping it real
But it ain't increasing the sales
It feels like I'm a new lyricist
And this ain't no Tech N9ne flow
How many Kutt Calhoun's Tech N9ne know
Tech my bro
And be the the first nigga that will tell mothafucka's "betta check my growth"
So unless I croak
I ain't never gonna rest my throat
And when I depend
On the likes of men
Cause god gon bless my soul

[Hook: Barbara Ward]
Said I don't hear, don't hear you calling my name
Said I don't hear, don't hear you calling my name
With everyone in the world to see in me and I don't know who's to blame
Cause I don't hear, don't hear you calling my name
