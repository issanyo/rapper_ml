[Instrumental vocal loop: Tech N9ne]
Some gangstas wanna head blast, 'cause I run with the red rags

[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Free Uno Ace Capone. The homie Keith Fudge, I got your back homie
LETS GO!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Crew, soo-woo
Nigga that's what we do
Who, be you
If you want funk me too

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I'm bool as a bubumber
Laces in my shoes makin' you wonder
Am I gonna act a fool or bring your crew thunder
Thinkin' I pack the tool, the one I use on her
I ain't trippin' but the old days got my mind glitchin'
Like different signs that ain't my kind got they 9's whistlin'
Like a nigga wanna find this and strip clips 'til my wines drippin'
But nobody wanna do no crime they just talkin' about rhyme spittin'
When I'm at the movies, careful how you steppin' to me
'Cause I think who's starin' at me wanna do me
'Cause I'm flamed up and soo woo-ey
Head crash, my head's bad
'Cause I be thinking some gangstas wanna head blast
'Cause I run with the red rags

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Crew, soo-woo
Nigga that's what we do
Who, be you
If you want funk me too

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I'm a motherfucking animal, red devil, Tasmanian
Bangins' in my cranium, Deuce Clique and five claimin' it
Kansas City thang, from two clips at my range is bandanna dangerous
You's crip when I'm sayin' it?
It's Soo-Woo business, then yous through nigga
Blood? I don't give a fuck if I knew you nigga
That's that 85 mentality, victim of your reality
Catchin', pumpin' that 7-11 in your fatalities
It's another nigga's wake-up, smoking water and drank up
Heavenly, blocks flames from 20's to the seventies
It's ballers tuckin' fed cash, to get you dead fast
Gangstas they head blast 'cause I run with the red flags!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Crew, soo-woo
Nigga that's what we do
Who, be you
If you want funk me too

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Uh, I'm just bicken back and bein' bool
You don't this feelin', look you fuckin' with the realest
No, gloves no, mask look you know we 'bout to kill it
Disrespect us here get your mami pinned to the ceilin'
This is still holdin' hemi's even when I'm in my jammies
Niggas wanna catch me slippin' leave me sleepin' like I'm manny
Plus they still sendin' threats, haters wanna pack me out
Bunch of internet hustlas always wanna run they mouth
I ain't trippin' still thuggin' for blood and getting guap
And you know I keep a oo-op let it sing just like a doo-wop
And it's always tough guys, they don't never wanna co-op

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Crew, soo-woo
Nigga that's what we do
Who, be you
If you want funk me too

[Verse 4: Big Scoob]
Signed up, suited and booted, old nigga, ready for war
Layin' back, stackin' cake, but it don't take much to activate
Snatch it back and act innate, rainin' down the hand of god
Chopper get to sanging nigga smokin' like itâ€™s El DeBarge
Forgive me Lord I'm trynna keep it cool
But I'm a old nigga with a quick fuse, quick to smell the bitch in dudes
Hard to walk in Scooby's shoes, do the shit that Scooby do
Fi' block, a general, I done paid my fuckin' dues
Nigga this the life I chose, fuck that, life I choose
Still livin' gang rules check the laces in these shoes
Gangsta nigga through and through, tried tested been approved
On blood, one love, nigga what, soo-woo

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Crew, soo-woo
Nigga that's what we do
Who, be you
If you want funk me too
Crew, soo-woo
Nigga that's what we do
Who, be you
If you want funk me too
