[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
I came to toast to the game (church)
OK, let me properly introduce first my hav-a-hoe game
I have a hoe in different area codes, few in the east
Couple down south, but mostly lay west of the coast
I wouldn't hav-a-hoe with flaws in her mix
Gotta be down right down, pretty, blade in tha bra with her tits
And if me with a bitch meant the kid didn't get no doe
Well then I wouldn't have-a-hoe (that's it)
Second and foremost, I walk with a limp
Bishop Don Magic Juan, Pimpin' Ken
Yeah, I talked wiht a Pimp, Good Game, White Folks
Metallic canes and thangs
U-M-E, Miami, Flo', they chopped game with Strange
Beware 'cause the industry gon' get messy
And I walk with a limp 'cause my dick's... well, you know
I got a fetish for suaving these Dolly Partons
These women, vibe off a nigga, that's real, ask Mr. Marcus
I'm here to put the cuffs on the game (and palm yo faces)
Then whip your ass 'til you holla my name (like dominatrix)
Ain't nobody gonna take this crown (why?)
('Cause we stay on point like Stacy Adams)

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Bitches on my bows everywhere I go
Pimpin' holla church, Rémy Extra po'
Get a lot of love, haters hit the doe
Get up out the whip, Gators hit the flo'
And we bubblin', money be doublin'
Niggas ain't struggling
Hat cocked to the side and we walk with up limp
'Cause our dick heavy, hey!

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I'm a barbarian, not a good Samaritan
I ain't a hoes keeper by far, leave it to married men
I gotta stick and move, pick and choose, chick-n-crews
Who like to suck dicks for loot
Snatch 'em then a hoe gets offered, snake and the bat tats (Strange)
Flashing through the sky like Gotham
Nickname stay flo, 'cause I'm known to put a crease
In ya lame day-old, newly grown dubious thesis
Atrocious behavior, ferocious demeanor, corroded ya name up
You owe it to Jesus
To wait in line now, and yearn for the buck flow
It don't matter if you win or lose, learn for the Gusto...
Trust no B-I-T-C-H
Especially when you live in the, F-I-F-T-Y states
Uhh, KC's Henry the 8th, with royalty on the plate
Pop a collar and get your limp on mate, ooh

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Bitches on my bows everywhere I go
Pimpin' holla church, Rémy Extra po'
Get a lot of love, haters hit the doe
Get up out the whip, Gators hit the flo'
And we bubblin', money be doublin'
Niggas ain't struggling
Hat cocked to the side and we walk with up limp
'Cause our dick heavy, hey!

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
Last, not least






[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Bitches on my bows everywhere I go
Pimpin' holla church, Rémy Extra po'
Get a lot of love, haters hit the doe
Get up out the whip, Gators hit the flo'
And we bubblin', money be doublin'
Niggas ain't struggling
Hat cocked to the side and we walk with up limp
'Cause our dick heavy, hey!
