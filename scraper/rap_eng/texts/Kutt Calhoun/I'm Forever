[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
You can't convince me
I'm not the missing link to the mystery unsolved
Created by history
Debated I'm simply
A candence of cleansing for all
I am the seasons
Sprinkled for reasons
So in the spring and fall
Y'all never could amount
To what I'm all about
Which furthermore should let you know that
I'm Highly exalted
Cannotbe faulted
I hope my reign is king
Pours over descendants
I'm independent
You should depend on me
'Cause I'm like a savior from your behavior
Are thou forsaken thee?
Naw!
I will only bless you, 'cause I'm here to rescue
From all these fake MC's

[Hook: Kutt Calhoun]
Sun, moon, stars, night, day, sky, and weather
All over the land we walk seven seas tied together
I am the anointed amongst all these dying records
Gotta let 'em know I'm forever
I'm forever
I'm forever
Sun, moon, stars, night, day, sky, and weather
All over the land we walk seven seas tied together
I am the anointed amongst all these dying records
Gotta let 'em know I'm forever
I'm forever
I'm forever

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I'm at defenses
Now I'm relentless
You can't prevent this wrath (no)
Casted upon you
I'm here to warn you, the end is among you fast
So get ready for Helter Skelter to welt ya
Refuge and shelters won't help ya
I'm like a ticking time bomb and similar to napalm
Ready to explode I tell ya
I'm a dramatic act of a new rap attack'll eat you up and back
'Cause it's less than it
Got a few out the back, on a new tit for tat, on a lyric comeback
Wouldn't reckon it
'Cause your food out the bag, I'll eat you like a snack
Then I'll chew out the back
To the death of 'im
Put 'em in the trash with the rest of 'em
Living like Kelvin, a cold ass piece of a specimen
When the beat drop, think not
He hops on to the east meet sun sheet, Planet Rock
I'mma beast, at least gotta feast on weak MCs like [?]
Till the memo drop
You so redundant, I'm so abundant
As big as they come with styles
Bigger than the New World Order
I'm the New World Order to reprimand to take you down

[Hook: Kutt Calhoun]

[Bridge: Kutt Calhoun]
The end is upon you now
Did you think the outcome would be any different?
Your career is underground
Buried away with no sign of remembrance
Sure it makes you wonder how
A body of one could bring so much significance
Now I gotta shovel through the rubbage
See if I can discover and salvage up anything worth listening
Lookie, lookie here, Kutt Calhoun new rookie of the year
Finally some substance, content  matter
For brand new start, everything's all clear
He could be the one to lead you, guide you, and teach you
The ways of a new found growth
Behold the creator of all rap kind
Ease your mind, my child, if you didn't know - I'm forever

[Hook: Kutt Calhoun]
