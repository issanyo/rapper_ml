[Pre-Hook]
My niggas goin' in, time to celebrate
All we do is win, so we celebrate
Police is on the way cause we celebrate
We do this everyday when we celebrate

[Hook]
Diamonds off of my jewels
Shoes matching my range
Ridin' round with that Nina
Rick James in my veins
You ain't all in your toss
You ain't stackin' no chips
You ain't spendin' no money mane
You ain't rockin' like this

[Verse 1]
Hand on the bottle, I'm wide asleep
Then lost the bitches, can't find my keys
The place is empty, smell like a lot of weed
But that's what happens when niggas be on their Charlie Sheen
Spade bottles, drink moscato I hate models, it's hood bitches
Back woods and moly poppin', addicted to this hood livin'
Gold teeth, gold chains that magnum rappers so gold mane
If being black with money is the tracks then I'm the soul train
Ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, on my dime Cornelius nigga
Ain't no head in my pack, me and my niggas all on this splendid
Hit them mall, lead em all, go get cases of liquor
Phone a couple of bitches, then we gon' get explicit

[Verse 2]
My niggas goin' in, time to celebrate
I'm known in the MO and I got hell to pay
But this molly kickin' in and it's hella stray
I swear to God it feels like I can levitate
Out my body, KC Tea's that's Hennessy with that sprite nigga
Lemon squeeze, nigga please, I've been off all nights nigga
Five racks of that liquor, ten racks of that 'caine
That's fifteen racks of two things, got five more till they came
All my niggas got felonies, nobody square in my camp
But everybody celebrities that street credit is on Namp
Fly whips, fly chips it's G4 you tripms
Pussy, weed and alcohol these ghetto boys so menage

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Cool in the game when we celebrate
Doing my thing in the "show me" state
Having my change and I know you hate
That's how I'll be feeding off y'all for motivation
So when you see me, you know I'm a star
No more struggle, that's on my momma
Everyday throughtout the week I got a different car
I said "Everyday throughtout the week I got a different car"
Gettin' paper like kinko's, Black Gold at its best nigga
Stacking money like a bricks fold
Got steep pockets on deck, nigga
So when you see me - bow your head
Cause it's royalty in the flesh nigga
Kutt Calhoun, MVP now where the fuck is my check nigga?
