[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
Konichiwa bitches come visit I call it the apartment
A 6 by 3 of whatever brings out your inner woman
I rock your body the twat is creamy and hot as sake
Let me inside and I'll let you ride on my Kawasaki
Let me get a bit of that bump bump bump bump bump bump bump action
And ima hit you with the bump bump bump bump hump with bolt action
I got your number, baby you might wanna slumber
Party over with a undercover brother who wonder
To find out what the D like inside in-between thighs
(Baby won't you tell me what that be like)
I got a fist full of hair and you ain't going nowhere
Right I'm done kissing your pear right on as you wanna stare
Cover your face up with the bedspread you letting the legs spread
(Damn girl you know you got the bed wet)
Now you calling me humongous stroking you with the thunda
I have to say I love the way you bunk rock

[Hook]
You ain't never seen a broad
Panties off and just offer herself like this
(Bunk rock bitch)
You ain't never seen a broad
Get her rocks off a rockstar nigga like this
(So little mama)
Don't be afraid of the way you feel
You know the team and the way we drill
Cause after the party, it's after the party
On the bus with a bunk rock bitch

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
You feisty and finicky
Half a bottle of Hennessy
Tour bus can for sure bust
And you full of that energy
Ain't no doubting your southern routing
It's pure and replenishing
Once you swallow now follow me to the back let's come get in-between
The top and the bottom bunk all up in the middle for me
Once I swallow a little pill those other rappers symbolize the pompus more sweet
Kutty Cal you're working with something baby boy don't be rough with me
Cause you know I got a boyfriend established when we do it he'll be known as C
That's when she put on the magnum with her mouth wouldn't feeling no teeth
And then she hopped on the dragon bringing out the villian in me
Got a little bit of something for nothing put my name in the pussy for sheezy
Can't wait to get a bump full of loving next time when I'm in her city
And I got my mojo and tack right give women that act right
My foreplay is the crack but then my dick is the glass pipe
My bunk is the hideout nobody will find out
When she leaves she tweaking looking all spooked cause she high now (on the bunk rock)

[Hook]

It goes, one little, two little, three little, bunk rocks then
Four little, five little, six little, bunk rocks then
Seven little, eight little, nine little, bunk rocks
More than ten of them bitches share some stories with me
I had fun with them, hung with them, plunged in they hot spots
I tongue split them, done did them, flung them and dropped it
And got drunk with them, sung with them, sprung them if not
Then I bet you none of them ever speak bad about me
To all the ladies who will be your dishes be on the lookout we in your town
Cause I'm looking for a team of butch for her skin and ain't scared to put it down
You can be black and Chinese, or a heavenly mix breed whatever it's gonna be we'll go
Cause I want the Prada, Gucci or Hadana, even when you wearing your nadas, gonna hit the floor
To all the ladies across the globe who ain't been in the bunk
We can do it in the bedroom or bathroom, Buick or whatever you want
An invitation to me sensation I'll mail it to some
But if you impatient get tired of waiting catch mail in this bunk

[Hook]
