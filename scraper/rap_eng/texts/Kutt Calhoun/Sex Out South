[Chorus: Tech N9ne & Big Krizz Kaliko] x2
Sex out south-some hit in and out
Screamin n cussin-some bustin it out
Sex out south-some freaks comin out
Sex  O.S. is what it's all about

[Verse 1: Kutt Kalhoun]
I got this bitch named Janae from Olathe
Baby girl was flavor
Into bitches and sexual favors
Told me I could take it
Got a fetish addicted to pain
Wanted me to choke her
While she sat on my dinck came
All over the sofa
But this ho from the o she was cold
Didn't like to swallow it
A pull to the back of the throat
Kept a bitch from vomittin
She begged for a dick in her ass
Baby liked it anal
But my head was too big for her ass
So I used my fingers
Down to Dallas with Rita & Alice
White and Phillipino
One on my dick and one tossin my salad
Off in the casino
Real sex ain't got shit on these vets
Told em they could keep me
Even thought about writin the check
I'm coocoo for a threezy
To all em bitches and hoes that leave your life unexposed
You better peak this out south bitches as pros
If you don't know how it goes
You besta follow your nose
Get on some freak shit
Now follow as the story is told
It's like..

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I know you heard, that, I, talk a lot of shit about a bitch
But I'm bout to swerve, this, time
And talk about a different kinda chick
The ones who love the dick constantly, in and out
Even like to put it in her mouth
And I'm not talkin about Northbound bitches
I'm talkin bout those bitches out south
You can find em in the 50's, all the way to Grandview
You can get em up in Overland Park and Olathe
They keep hella paper
Never given a fuck about your other bitches nigga petty shit is second nature
Throw em in the mix, nigga fuck em with a friend
They will be callin you so they can do it again
You ain't gotta spend, ain't gotta pretend
Call her up and tell her you needed to put it in
And not just white, there's hella beautiful black bitches
Give it from the back, they lovin the dick too
Down North women, they hate but bitch boo
I know you don't like what I'm sayin ,but it's true
And ya'll be fuckin the bitches like we be fuckin the bitches
We be out for the pussy and then we duckin you bitches
Nothing you never could tell a nigga we could gonna be fuckin
Never stoppin it cause I ain't had enough of you bitches
Now, sex out south you can put it in her mouth
And you don't need help from Hitch
You can find em in a house of six
Pretty damn thing with one and switch
Any other women hatin, got a nigga waitin
For that weak shit you pitch
Lay that shid-it di-down, bid-itch
Quit it, sit down trid-icks, skidip now BITCH

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm talkin bout chicks at center
Where I'm from
St. Theresa's, Bishop Hogan up in her
Hickman Mills, Ruskin them the ones that I be tusslin' wit
Now I'mma get mine, and I'm hopin you get yours, before I'm THROUGH
Cause Kali be mackin' them hoes fast
And if ya lucky to getcha a piece of evil ass whoo
Where the redbones
Cause them the ones I love out South get my head gone
And they never wanna let me pull it out when I'm in em
So I'm pullin the rubber out
When I need it I'm takin the southern route
And if it's late at night, clutch your lady tight
When me and my niggas is out south
Get it with no doubt
Sit it in your mouth
If ya with it then baby let me hit it in down south
Still I got too many bitches that are (close to me)
And the ladies were really lookin like they (hoes to me)
Like a, like a, lover
I got to get some more of her
Oochee coochie the way you do me
You really give it to me when we be (under the covers)
Felicia (Oh) I'm glad to meet ya
But when you kiss this this and it spits then go ballistic
I jump over pussy for head I get to rockin' the bed
They heard us outside screamin' SOUTHSIDE

[Chorus] x2
