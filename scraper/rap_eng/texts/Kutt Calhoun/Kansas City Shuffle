Move to the south what's wrong with ya
They say them Kansas City boys ain't strong enough
To break through to mainstream and flourish up
We them niggas eatin' your pourage up
You suckas need to check billboards 3 out of 4 is us
Year after year done tore it up (the boards is us)
We snatching and y'all ain't even got no hops
Just a video, and some radio spots, (that ain't nothing)
To two hundred and two shows yearly touring
And the bracket that your still enduring, (ain't close enough)
To count your eggs before they hatch there homie
Might depresiate your assets homie,(game over)
We are the blueprint of what to follow
Fresh heir of a new tomorrow, so don't get it twisted
And get tricked now on your hustle, [look away!]
It's the Kansas City shuffle I told you

[Kutt Calhoun & Krizz Kaliko]
Believe only half of what you see, and nothing that you may hear, is never the way it seems
An illusion of no reality, what the eyes see, and hear the brain will follow the lead
We are the secret society of fiends, conspiring to deceive all minds leaving them puzzled
Now that I have your attention, I'll mention you have just fell victim to whats called the Kansas City shuffle

[Kansas City Shuffle Ohhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!]

The juggernauts of the independent game have surfaced
For reconcilable change of survice
Stood away in the shadows as this rap thang came to deterrent
Left to burn in the flame in furnace
Somebody dial 9-1-1, and we attempting to rescue hip-hop honor
And heritage from a seus pool (cardiac arrest closed arteries clogged vesicles)
Whoever was in charge wasn't feeding her with the best foods
Giving mouth to mouth, (pulse keep decreasing)
We checking for vital signs, (don't think shes breathing)
And flatline only 7 minutes at top, (to resuscitate her)
We need a big adrenaline shot
To get pierced through the chest plate and puncture the heart (swing)
Eyes wide open (I think we found us a heart beat)
No thanks necessary doing our job
Just when you thought the midwest was odd, we gonna hit you with the
