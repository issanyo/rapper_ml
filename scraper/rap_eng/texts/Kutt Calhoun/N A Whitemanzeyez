No more speaking that black male oppressed shit!
Full speed ahead, none of that retrogressed shit!
Looks can be deceiving, know that seeing is believing!
Black muthfuckas on a quest for retribution, overdue for the retrieval

[Kutt Calhoun]
I'm a nigga with no fame, a nigga with no brain, a nigga with mo' Kane than Abel
I'm a nigga with no change, a nigga with no pain, a nigga that won't change a fable
I'm a nigga that's hardcore, a nigga that starts war, a nigga that's far more than war
Thinkin I'm a nigga with a whole lot of venom; but don't nobody know that I'm sentimental
I'm a nigga that's so trife, a nigga with no life, a nigga with no rights at all
I'm a nigga that's so hype, a nigga you won't like, a nigga that don't like the law
I'm a nigga that stay keyed, a nigga that smoke weed, a nigga that pop B's and E's
Please believe he's a thief; reefer leak through the streets to the beast he's a link
Why - am I treated like a redheaded stepchild?
Why - can a brother get ahead of the mess now?
Why - do you think a black man gon' step down?
Why - 'til the inner city heads get left out?
I - never met a black or white with no pride, never met a man in life who won't try
To do what it takes to make a quick rise
Anyone in the way of fam is gon' die
So all of you Nazi Aryan nation placin hatred 'cross the nation
Racin, for segregation, fuck your regulations
Anticipations on yo' gay administrations
Makin weightful statements, you never make 'em, in a whitemanzeyez

[Chorus x2]
I ride for my people
I die for my people
Stand high on my steeple
To lies treating people
Devils are one sided
Spirits are misguided
Thinking that black birds don't fly
In a whitemans eyes

[Kutt Calhoun]
I'm a nigga with no start, a nigga that get hard, then be in carcerated
I'm a nigga that you brought, a nigga that you fought, a nigga that you taught the hatred
I'm a nigga with no hope, a nigga who's so broke, that his whole life's a joke
With nothing to gain and everything to loose, hell if that ain't lame, then I'm the same as you (huh)
I'm a nigga with no skills, a nigga with no mills, a nigga with Po' children, nigga that go steals
A nigga that dope deals, a nigga that won't feel the pleasure of more fills with leather
I'm a nigga with hard time, a nigga with barred lines, a nigga with art crimes to go
With the life of stars, I'm a trifling' star, fall right in the arms of your woe
Do you feel I'm a get what chu' gave?
Do you feel I'm a minimum wage?
Do you feel I'm a impotent slave?
Answer this..? feel me with this rage

"In the words of the late great, I'll probably be murdered for this shit that I said
I speak the real, be a legend, breathin' the dead."

I ride for my people
When it's time, when god is my witness
Die for my people
When it's time, I'm bombing with viscous lines
When I speak it, from the mind, and I'm sufficient
Prime, rhyme and reason every time
In a whitemans eyes

[Chorus x2]
I ride for my people
I die for my people
Stand high on my steeple
To lies treating people
Devils are one sided
Spirits are misguided
Thinking that black birds don't fly
In a whitemans eyes

[Kutt Calhoun]
The black the strong
The heart the lone
Rough the times
In a word on my own
The stress the crys
The truth the lies
That bless the lives
In a word all alone
Death, demise
Reject the spies
Respect will rise
In a world so prone
We be never be no equal cause
You be devilish people so

Could you take a couple seconds out of your time
So I can really voice what's on my mind
Look into the eyes of which is not blind
And tell me what you see when I tell ya i'ma strong
Muthfucka, Independent with long-gevity
And I'm a benefit, it's on!
If you thinkin' I'm illiterate (hit home)
When you hear how a nigga spit
So richeous the nicest
You hate that you like it
I give and take through this crisis
So whites and afrkids fighting for life
But I got Mexicans and Asians beside me
Even Caucasians and Jamaicans taking stand in America what's right
This is a war, and you loosing with un even scores
One for my your hate, three for minorities and even more
(Backwards Talk)
Reach through my blood and pour
Pour Liquid expanding, vicious explosions the final score

[Chorus x2]
I ride for my people
I die for my people
Stand high on my steeple
To lies treating people
Devils are one sided
Spirits are misguided
Thinking that black birds don't fly
In a whitemans eyes
