[Intro]
Somebody tell me what the fuck's goin' on with these niggas out here man? I ain't understand it, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm the Kansas City nigga, man, you know what I'm sayin'? Straight from Killa City, man. And what niggas do around here, man. They keep to theyself. But I see these niggas, man. The way they look at me when I roll, they sideways frowns and shit, man. And I just wanna let you bitch-ass niggas know, I see you niggas, man

[Verse 1]
You see me roll in the Chevy, know that I'm doing it heavy
Your body language will tell me nigga, I see you nigga
The Fendi kicks and the belvi the skinny jeans and the smelly
When I walk past is making you wanna be me nigga
But I ain't mad, matter fact impressed
A hatin' campain, I didn't know I had one yet
That was the same thing I was just asking Tech
He told me niggas get mad at established vets
They wanna steal your swagger, and kill your laughter
Stick every nigga who get rich and you with daggers
Will smile up in your face, but then will boo you after
It's all the same, part of the game when you's a factor
So niggas keep on feeding me all the fuel to gas up
My passion, I'm blasting right through and past ya
And you won't have to worry 'bout the ruins after
'Cause Kutty Cal's the sho'nuff, who? The master

[Hook: Kutt Calhoun & Tech N9ne]
Yo, you muggin' hard on the low
I see it
The way you look at my car when I roll
I see it
But no, even with my sucka duckas on
I see it
You hatin' on me
I see it
Quit fakin' homie
I see it
Yo, you muggin' hard on the low
I see it
The way you look at my car when I roll
I see it
But no, even with my sucka duckas on
I see it
You hatin' on me
I see it
Quit fakin' homie
I see it

[Verse 2]
My bank account large, your bank account small
But fresh as I'm raw, niggas y'all spoiled
I tour across all 50 states, y'all
Home with no job, scratching your balls (kids)
You muthafuckas about to witness
One of the baddest niggas up out of middle Kansas City
I do it mane
I got the right to be cocky
Pac and the Biggie gave me a vision
You must've done missed it, you better school 'em, mane
R-r-rollin', I'm stayin' making connect while you're playin'
I'm just s-s-saying my man, you better get up on it
P-p-pose and I'm playin'
Soakin' globally and I'm choke up the doe on fam
When I put the milli on it (whatever)
'Cause this word is disturbed, you just heard
But it gets worse, you disperse and get murder
[?], your lips sore can get [?]
[?]

[Hook: Kutt Calhoun & Tech N9ne]
Yo, you muggin' hard on the low
I see it
The way you look at my car when I roll
I see it
But no, even with my sucka duckas on
I see it
You hatin' on me
I see it
Quit fakin' homie
I see it
Yo, you muggin' hard on the low
I see it
The way you look at my car when I roll
I see it
But no, even with my sucka duckas on
I see it
You hatin' on me
I see it
Quit fakin' homie
I see it

[Verse 3]
Boom shaka-laka, soo-woo, walkin' in two suckas
Move on your partner, come through, blacka, with two marakas
You got a problem the Deuce problem, see you about it
You with the top, we shoot the blocka, but then we out it
It ain't even gotta be this way
Niggas start a lot of beef these days
Never wonder in the streets in-play
'Cause off the porch it's a different game
Pistols and pillies and mack millis for niggas who wack
Silly and hate on the fact, niggas is gettin' the cash
Come up to me with that jazz, I'mma be ready to blap
Famous like Trav Barker get hit from the start with a strap
So I hope you got a clear understandin' who's in demand
And that you way too damn reluctant to see
'Cause I don't wanna have to ruin your plans
To be all because nigga with no love was fucking with me

[Hook: Kutt Calhoun & Tech N9ne]
Yo, you muggin' hard on the low
I see it
The way you look at my car when I roll
I see it
But no, even with my sucka duckas on
I see it
You hatin' on me
I see it
Quit fakin' homie
I see it
Yo, you muggin' hard on the low
I see it
The way you look at my car when I roll
I see it
But no, even with my sucka duckas on
I see it
You hatin' on me
I see it
Quit fakin' homie
I see it
