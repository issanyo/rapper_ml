[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
I'm a bread winner, you wanna make a fortune?
Place all your money on the black and on the red, nigga
This ain't a gamble, it's a promise, I'm a head splitter
Y'all been sleepin' on me, now it's time to shake the bed, nigga
And wake 'em up to the way the Midwest, spit the
Cold, Theraflu, but I'm not Kanye West dissin'
Kansas City (Stand up!)
Who ever laughed sittin'? (Good)
Now you all can see the heart of where the fans livin'
Killer City, Misery, don't desire your company
I got it all covered unless you're comin' to fuck with me
Tech N9ne rich and everybody along with me
Deuce click, nigga, I got the town up under me
Whole 'nother chief, I politic for the streets
Black Gold leakin', it's prominent to this peak
Dominance for the weak, who's eager for me to speed
My people into an all-star lane and take the lead, nigga

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I am the last of a dying breed
Live by one code that some gon' heed
Get rich or die tryin' so I don't sleep
So cold in these streets I'm Kelvin

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Pac reincarnated, y'all made it (Wait a minute)
Y'all didn't make shit because the Lord gave me
Soul in the mouth to deliver out to all waitin'
For a new arrival, what, consider me a tall fable
Standin' in the light, I got 'em all shakin'
"Why they have to bring this nigga out" is what they're all sayin'
Strange Music nightly shinin' armor sent me off slayin'
Every coward nigga in the business with a false stance
Hope you made a livin' off your corny hoax, man
(All of y'all comedians) Cause lyrically your whole stand-up
It's a joke, you should know that the Sandman
Need to put the cane to your throat and do the jig dance
Cause the gig's up, I wish you big luck
Hope it was time that were spent instead of big bucks
I'm old-school like Atari when I Dig Dug
Graves for you non-valid rappers in this business

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
I'm a beat eater, your regular street figure
But with that heroin flow I'm an elite speaker
I leave the streets tweakin', addicted with G fever
The kind that come every now and then like a leap year
Now they bleed clear, y'all can rest in peace here
Something like a God that's eternal like a Greek myth
Flowin' out your radio into them sweet ears
I don't have to tell you that it's no longer a secret
The gloves is off an y'all got a weak chin
How many niggas gettin' jawed for the beatin'? (brawl)
My defense, (awesome) unique spit
Leave a nigga shittin' in his drawers from defeat then
Compete with anybody relevant
If anybody know of anybody you can tell 'em this
Black Gold up for keeps and I ain't sellin' shit
But if they bad enough then come and lick it off a Melvin stick

[Hook]
