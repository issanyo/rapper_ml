[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Indubitably we are the greatest
And if you don't like we then you're probably hatin'

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Want it, cop it, Kali, stop it
Krizz Kaliko see I'm better known as the show-off
Liquor sipper, she look thicker
Strip for me baby you lookin' better with clothes off
In it, out it, been about it
Church boy, search boy, think boy, sing boy
Dumb and dumber, this is summer
'Bout to take it over and you ain't know nothin' 'bout it
When I get up-a, I'm goin' straight to the tippy
Fuck you, 'cause you, can't fuck with me
It's all about the cow now
I shall make 'em bow down
And get in the gut of your girl and she give me that
Bladow, tadow, that owl
You who I'm speaking to
It's apparent you're transparnt
Weak and we can see through
Think about it 'fore you speakin'
Never should've let me in I got the whole world singin'

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Everybody everywhere
You know I'm coming to collect my share
So put your hands in the air
Wave 'em around like you just don't care
Everybody everywhere
You know I'm coming to collect my share
So put your hands in the air
Wave 'em around for me and if you with me say

[Interlude: Krizz Kaliko]
Yeah baby, that's right
Talk to 'em now

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I'm bloody, Kutty, ghetto, hood
Creepin' low got that Eagle off safety I wish you would
Get it twitty, gooey, dare ya, ooh
Give a nigga a reason to Pinesol your wood
I'm in mayhem heaven, 2-4-7
Lil' homie you think I'm lyin' then my name ain't Melvin
I'm comin', comin' to get it, I need it, gotta have it
It's murdersome here with strong we addicted and gotta have it
Young and the restless won't be no resting unless you poseless
Several pellets causing your death and it's so repulsive
Recoup for the loot dealers and killas, murder's my [?]
We bang and abuse half of these losers hootin' soo woo (soo woo)
That's the call for it, so get at me
I ain't fallin' back you little fags'll have to bladat me
That's the truth and the dare, the proof and the prayer
It's Kutty, finna collect either a tooth or your fare

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Everybody everywhere
You know I'm coming to collect my share
So put your hands in the air
Wave 'em around like you just don't care
Everybody everywhere
You know I'm coming to collect my share
So put your hands in the air
Wave 'em around for me and if you with me say

[Interlude: Krizz Kaliko]
It ain't over baby, alright
We gon' give you a little bit more
Right here, right now

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Did it, done it, got 'em (real) good
Packin' something on me, I'm wishin' a nigga would
Smoke it, puff it, chief it (real) good
I don't really do it b-but I would if I could
Light her for me, hit it, pass it
Oh no, not to me 'cause I'm drunk, and I'm really blasted
Party, hard-y, get it, shorty
If I can't get with you, my niggas'll do it for me
I'm tryna get a piece of more of the-more of the porridge
If the stain gon' flourish then I'll ignore it
I got bills to pay plus I'm tryna ride on 30 inches
Put me in coach up tied around in bitches
Get 'er done
And maybe I won't be such a bitter one
When I see 'em clappin' and dollars get to stackin' in traffic
But I ain't traffickin' the trap and (nah)
Let me up in this bitch and let's see what's happenin'

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Everybody everywhere
You know I'm coming to collect my share
So put your hands in the air
Wave 'em around like you just don't care
Everybody everywhere
You know I'm coming to collect my share
So put your hands in the air
Wave 'em around for me and if you with me say
