[Intro: Sample]
This should be played at high volume, preferably in a residential area

[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
Nigga, I been dope since Reaganomics, son of a crack fiend, holler at me
Robbin' niggas for Starter jackets when Jeanswest had all the swagger
We had that Bannister Mall cracking, white tee, 2X tall Staffords
Rockports, Box Chevys with Tech N9ne, let 'em all have ya

[Tech N9ne]
I been dope, cleaner than soap, with my kinfolk, Big Kutty Cal
Let the sin soak and begin tokin' with a friend, smoke really nutty wild
That indo seepin' slow, them hoes wanna love me now
I been gold, deep within those silly bimbos, hella slutty, wow

[Kutt Calhoun]
Uhh, now that's the Ninna I know from back in them days
Nigga, we played questions, we ate X's
Played truth or dare when we laid bitches
Wrote about it then made riches, planet rocked and we stayed grittin'

[Tech N9ne]
Then sprayed kittens with Glade, spittin', display given, these babes diggin'
Off of that I been boss of rap, I been called the gat and that's N9ne, nigga
Been all of that since I caught the mack and put 'iancs and racks in my mind, nigga
Even when I shot them out the window, then
I was a grim nigga, take 'em to the end, no men woke
After gettin' their chin broke, but when the pen stroke, Ninna been dope

[Hook: Kutt Calhoun]
Before I started claimin' my set (I been dope, man)
Even before I hooked up with Tech (I been dope, man)
Back when y'all was hatin' my crew (I been dope, man)
Don't gotta tell me 'cause I already knew (I been dope, man)

[Tech N9ne]
Even when my first lines came out (I been dope, man)
Since Lee Capone let N9ne raid out (I been dope, man)
Since massacre in Nnutthowze days (I been dope, man)
Since Calhoun and A. Yates was made (I been dope, man)

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Ey, let me let these niggas know how far I go back with dopeness, man
Yeah, like a bean to a pinto, dope fiend to a rental
Hung like a trench coat like McSpears with the children before her 5% of it always been post
So I been dope, nigga, purest form of that Montana
Throwback, nigga, put a bitch in check like back when Ike put his hands to Anna

[Tech N9ne]
Just eat the cake Anna Mae, please
Then take a drink of this Bay Breeze
When I create these they really hate me
Fakes be shaky, 'cause it's dope shit they see
I been dope and I hope that you listen
Fixed ya like you did soap in the kitchen
I open, I'm rippin' you, hopin' I'm glitching
But ain't no motherfuckin' hope in your dissing

[Kutt Calhoun]
You lookin'-ass nigga, soft in the middle
Lil' pussy-ass nigga, try to be me
Wish you could be-ass nigga and you niggas just ain't cut from my fabric
'Cause I style on ya, with the quick a nigga rip and I be fowl ya
Short term niggas, I'm a milestone and yo style's slowed down
Now Kutty Cal'll sick the clown on ya

[Tech N9ne]
Yes, I'm that nigga with the clown persona
Bound to beat a nigga down to a coma
I was on a 56th corner, then I made it, now I go where I wanna
And I for sho' can, gathering more fans
Even if they rep another color, I think, "Because I been dope, man"

[Hook: Kutt Calhoun]
Before I started claimin' my set (I been dope, man)
Even before I hooked up with Tech (I been dope, man)
Back when y'all was hatin' my crew (I been dope, man)
Don't gotta tell me 'cause I already knew (I been dope, man)

[Tech N9ne]
Even when my first lines came out (I been dope, man)
Since Lee Capone let N9ne raid out (I been dope, man)
Since massacre in Nnutthowze days (I been dope, man)
Since Calhoun and A. Yates was made (I been dope, man)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Somebody said I wasn't dope so I dismiss 'em
They probably listen to faulty shit and I ain't gonna list 'em
My crew not new to this, been fortune and fame a while
From dancin' all over the track like Oppa Gangnam Style

[Kutt Calhoun]
To B walkin' on stages, came from the IcyRoc's basement
Now I feed off of my paper, makin' cream off of you haters
I'm worldwide with this business, screamin' "Fuck y'all," independent
Did for Kutt dog with this industry, we're not sorry and shit and Tecca Ninna

[Tech N9ne]
Been in rap long, you can take a look, my stats' grown
'Cause Strange Music and Tech Ninna is this nation's backbone
I was dope in this song and that song way back home
Not a ne'er, not a trace of the hatin'
'Cause ain't a fuckin' piece of wack shown

[Kutt Calhoun]
Yeah, now it's back on, preview into the sequel
Kansas City's the pipe, but now I'm the Cavy you needin'
Cop me over the counter, I'm easily your addiction
Kutty Cal is the drug and your future, want a prescription, bro?

[Hook: Kutt Calhoun]
Before I started claimin' my set (I been dope, man)
Even before I hooked up with Tech (I been dope, man)
Back when y'all was hatin' my crew (I been dope, man)
Don't gotta tell me 'cause I already knew (I been dope, man)

[Tech N9ne]
Even when my first lines came out (I been dope, man)
Since Lee Capone let N9ne raid out (I been dope, man)
Since massacre in Nnutthowze days (I been dope, man)
Since Calhoun and A. Yates was made (I been dope, man)
