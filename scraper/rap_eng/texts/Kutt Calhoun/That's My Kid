[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
If my kid has a problem
It's up to me as the guardian to go solve 'em
Make my life and involve 'em
Late at night when I call 'em
I like to hear 'em say daddy your song is awesome
Instead of gangbangers in school won't let up
I'm fed up I'm wondering if you can come up and red up
You shut up, negativity can be found inside of my angels
Even though I was stupid but I put it down
Set trippin' - But I let it go headed for energetic flow
When I'm up to know that I was down and out
But now I'm breaded though
I know you saw me rep colors when I was young, dumb and malicious
I'm thankful, that all my blemishes never made you suspicious
Latched on to light
That's known to hype apparent you coherent knowing I rapped wrong to right
Love and positivity instilled in my kid
Their family my family their mother and I did
Discipline starts at home even if they can't stand you
Watch em' fights land, you clock em' right hand
To stop em' that a man if you stand up even add a camera
They won't be James Holmes, and they won't be Adam Lanza
Or John Malvo, I'll flow loud for my child though
Ain't raising no groucho evil out my house yo
Instead of me watching em' disappear in the night
Air em' at graduation saying that's my kid right there

[Hook: Cee Lo Green]
I proudly proclaim my love
The future's born from my own flesh and blood
All that matters this time
So my prayer is that the sun will always shine
On that sweet child of my mine

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
To my unborn I give my all so you could ball like I couldn't
Stay in school and play it smooth and do those things that I wouldn't
Pay attention and keep your distance from ignorant instances
Play a instrument anything that you want just envision it
Follow your dreams, no matter what may come or what may fall
Cuz' ain't no shame in failing as long as you know you gave your all
Staned up, man up, get a handle on yourself tighten your belt
Do what you can to do for you and ya'll just don't, do it for the wealth that they offer
It sounds awful but if me and your mama' ain't talking
And she said that I ain't offering a call just as often as I should
I pray that you get older and you understand that I was just, doing what I could
If she let me, if you have a second I could explain
Like so many transitions in life that people change
Whether I'm on top soil, or dead in a box
I love you dearly sincerely and that'll never stop
For my kid...
For my kid...

[Hook: Cee Lo Green]
I proudly proclaim my love
The future's born from my own flesh and blood
All that matters this time
So my prayer is that the sun will always shine
On that sweet child of my mine

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
Paris and Darius Dariana Unique Oshay Malik
And one on the way in a matter of weeks
But it's a shame cuz' I think that my other daughter ain't mine
Andria baby I love you I guess your father was blind
In due time you'll understand it, how your mama' was scandelous,
(Wait this don't seem right man, I don't think I can handle it,)
When I all I ever did was show love for you
Sweated blood for you, any moment take a slug for you
But its cool, the baby mama drama is expected
And that karma is going to be what I been blessed with
Sit back and learn your lessons as our seeds grow from kids to adolescence
Then resent you for yourself as misdirection
The first to heed the message is Malik
Abandonded by his mama' on Thanksgiving evening
Bout' three years ago was up to me to feed to em morals
Values manhood, knowledge a week ago he graduated
You ask me, then Ima' say

[Hook: Cee Lo Green]
I proudly proclaim my love
The future's born from my own flesh and blood
All that matters this time
So my prayer is that the sun will always shine
On that sweet child of my mine

[Outro: Tech N9ne & little girl]
Pay attention to your children
They shouldn't be able to be into too much that you're not aware of
Together we are a powerful force
As one mind, body and soul
Let no evil enter nor attempt
To reduce us because of the beliefs we hold
And with this love combined with our strength
We ward off pain and stress
Technician I am wholeheartedly in life and in death
Tech N9ne!
