[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
Started in '85 when my town got turned out
Niggas from Cali brought it to the mid and we learned how
Blue or red paisleys powders was the start of a war now
Unification that got the whole nation concerned now
Middle of '91 I was jumped by a cuz hive
Solely the reason I was introduced to the blood life
Niggas about they money make it sunny at night fly
Whips and bitches and everything was hung from the right side
We gettin' it back bangin' and brawlin' you feelin' me
Strapped with heavy artillery on the streets and it's kill or be killed
40's of malt liquor and sherm was instilled in me
Taught to dump on any niggas from different facilities
Real talk and it's real life it's dangerous ain't it
Suburbanites better think twice if your thinkin' of bangin'
Whatever town that you in if it's rippin' or flamin'
Throw your bandanas in the sky and rep the gang that you claimin' cuz this is

[Verse 2: Joe Vertigo]
I been so whoopin' and saggin' an OG status red raggin' it
As long as niggas been hatin' the blood I bust ain't been havin' it
Flaggin' it, it's drippin' thick just like a bitch on her menstral
Lets get straight to the point just like them things in my pistol
These are the missiles that'll show you what the blood do
Blood in blood out, now you got the blood drippin' from your mouth
I'm a shout (soo-woop, soo-woop) watch them rellies go
NIgga know if you ain't come to bang what you come here for
I'm fo sho bangin' on the block I throw them B's up
Bustin' bustin' bitches black bernellies make em freeze up
Ease up I got some shit that'll plant you like a tree stump
Givin' em the bidness bang with strange nigga please jump
Knuckle up take it to the streets take our shirts off
Go straight for throat like a coyote and snatch your skirt off
I'm that nigga that'll bring em to your block
Nigga fuck bein' a goblin I'm a motherfuckin' ???

Hey don't get it twitted nigga
I got a little crip nigga that don't fuck around
Hey yo Riv, eat they face nigga

[Verse 3: Riv Locc]
Hellish contained the covenant and the true proof
I rep the same colors that BIG Tookie and Snoop do
Color coordinated goin' to war makin' my knowledge evolved
Beefin' with heat over (colors) homie lilke Rocket and Frog
When we choppin' poppin' watch your parners drop and dissolve
I can't be touched too long like a hot object honestly dog
See I'm a night crawler (vivid) just like relivin' the true dream
You can tell I'm true by the (colors) of my shoe strings
Yeah I'll muder your ambitions
In the game'll cut deen in ya like a surgical incision
With verbulan intuition from a vertical position
I represent a word that has no definition
Authentic, genuine pure than a soul of a chrsitian
Lyrically the big homie Kutty expose a depiction
(Colors) fluctuate to keep a pistol in your waist line
I got the whole city behind my back like a state line
