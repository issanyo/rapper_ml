He done hit me again sweetie
Shit, where he at?
He in the kitchen. let's meet up at the spot
Alright I'll be there in 15 minutes baby don't you worry
Yeah
While you in the kitchen pourin the liquor with no suspicion
That women you was just hittin's on a mission
Who you think she be callin on, me
When you push her she fallin on me
I'm the cat that be with her, you the one she runnin from
See she told bout your short fuse temper, the soars you give her
Will heal but she will always remember
How you blatantly use her as a punchin bag, you got insecurities
A prisoner in her house but I be givin her immunity
You ain't knowin you got a bad muthaf*cka
A nigga would love to have type of lova
Well maybe it's that you do know
Wonderin how the hell she got what you've blown
That's probably why you keep her feelin too low to go
You too rapped up in yourself homeboy with your lavish rides
And jewelery, narcissism ain't got nothin to do with the
Way that I put the twist on her, everytime you picture her
She hit me in the second that you leave, I come to pick her up because
I'm your, (I'm your)
Lady's, (lady's)
Bestest, (bestest)
Good friend
Yes I be sleepin with her, on the low be creepin with her
While you trippin, beefin with her, that's why I be deep up in her, you know
I'm your, (I'm your)
Lady's, (lady's)
Bestest, (bestest)
Good friend
Hey, cause when she be with you, baby think of me

What's up Kutt Throat
What's up baby
I'll be there in like 5 baby
Alright I'm already here. I'll be lookin out for you
Yeah look for me
She done told me bout your lack in the package and how you wack in the sac
Can't keep a woody cause off of that yak
She ain't tell ya how I fattened her assets and how I captured that classic
Facial expressions when she bustin orgasmic
Acrobatics on the top of the mattress crackin the headboard
This is what you'd hear if you was next door, she be screamin
Kutty baby give it to me all up in her balls deep
Smoke a cigarette and then we fall asleep (fall asleep)
I'll have her home by the top of the mornin
Before you get home from with your boys doin some late night whorin
You don't know what she been through, I cut her like a ginsu
You hug her and she tellin you she missed you
I can only laugh at the fact that you feelin you always get away with murder
And you serious, nigga, but now I'm here to say
Keep on being oblivious, not knowin your chick is with a real ass nigga
And try and picture this (picture this)
I'm your, (I'm your)
Lady's, (lady's)
Bestest, (bestest)
Good friend

Lady's, (lady's)
Bestest, (bestest)
Good friend

What's up Kutt baby, I see you over there in the truck
Well hurry up and bring your ass over here girl
Here I come
Come on
Now your girl is lookin fine man, she's all in my range
And the seat is bout to recline man
I'm takin pictures with my cellular, she's doin what I'll tellin her
And I ain't gotta tell ya how it's wet enough
Then again, you wouldn't know cause you don't get that lucky
And you don't suck see, that's when I proceed
To give your woman donkey love and bucked naked monkey love
And make you grab your pistol playa partna I don't want you woman
I'm just the opposite of what you lackin
Cause you wear Lifestyles and I wear Magnums
It's clear that she ain't feelin you, it's been about a year or two
You pull it out and that is when you kill the mood
But listen, I drop her off when you there and you get to fussin
That when I tell you homie I'm her cousin man
You fell for the scandal unaware that just an hour ago
She was grabbin the oh shit handles (Oh shit)
I'm your, (I'm your)
Lady's, (lady's)
Bestest, (bestest)
Good friend
Yes I be sleepin with her, on the low be creepin with her
While you trippin, beefin with her, that's why I be deep up in her, ya see
