[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
Breaking the ice with something fresh
Back to the good of it
Tryna bring the world back to the hood a bit
All the way from the Show-Me State
To the center of New York, down south, to the Golden Gate
All my boss dogs keepin' it keeblur, all across united S
Living B.L.E.V.E., overheating the eating
All the ones getting paid, ride around all four days
That's 24 each, on your Jeeps and Escalades
The sun ain't shining if your chain tucked in
With the brains blown off, you better blaze something
If you drinking, that's a fifth of that liquid, styrofoam cups
Eyes through the brim, tryna savour the liquor
Got a a feeling then you takin' it with ya
A lot of niggas tryna hate, gotta flash then you takin' the picture
Been on the block with that shake in your system
Sideline hoes, they all cheerlead, but you shakin' 'em bitch

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
All around the globe, we get that paper from the dope
When all my playas from the MO, we get that dough
We keep it keeblur
Chevys, Hummers, Escalades
[?] spinnin, choppin' [?]
Ride on it, get down to get that dough
We keep it keeblur

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I gotta question. What? It's serious as cancer
What is it? Can you send a striptease dancer?
Out to get her money and give it to you because you gotta
Use it to buy yo wife Gucci and Prada
I drop 10s, they drop grams, don't block, man
She pop Xans, then shock watch me rock fans
Roxanne, won't you go down and rock men
And cop dance, workin' with yo mouth in your hot hands
Is kept keebler, we steps deeper
We rep the beefers, then respect the [?]
She asked what I represent
And then with a wicked pinch
I said "B walkin', and everything that comes with it, bitch"
56, 57 Rogue Dogs (Deuce)
Regime [?] we told y'all
We keep it about the green falling from the trees
Kutty Cal, Tecca Nina, with my nigga Kali Kiz
Keep it keeblur

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
All around the globe, we get that paper from the dope
When all my playas from the MO, we get that dough
We keep it keeblur
Chevys, Hummers, Escalades
[?] spinnin, choppin' [?]
Ride on it, get down to get that dough
We keep it keeblur

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
From the block to star
You can be an all city globetrotter even if you're not from Harlem













[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
All around the globe, we get that paper from the dope
When all my playas from the MO, we get that dough
We keep it keeblur
Chevys, Hummers, Escalades
[?] spinnin, choppin' [?]
Ride on it, get down to get that dough
We keep it keeblur
