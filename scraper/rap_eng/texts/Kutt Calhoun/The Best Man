I now pronounce you man and wife, you may kiss the bride
(Cheers)
But on some real shit, you gonna tell that nigga
Kutt: yeah I'm a tell that nigga man
You better tell him or I'm a tell him
Kutt: Nah I'm a tell him, it's kind of a sensitive subject though
You know what I'm sayin, that nigga love the bitch dog
This is a story of a female dog
And in this tale the dog, be gettin busy
Chasin after two wrongs
Lookin for food and shelter in two homes
But when you bite the hand that feeds ya
You find yourself on your ass when you do wrong
Listen to the words that I'm speakin
This is your best man
Was a good and bad syndicate, like Heaven and Hell
Used to run the streets since the age of 11 or 12
Your momma was my momma, mi casa was su casa
Hangin out at skippin parties, thunderbird and?
We used to seel dope together, stackin major chips
Thinkin ain't nobody in this city could fade the click
Two niggas that would kill for each other on the real though
No questionin our loyalty we bonifide real bros
I remember when we used to f*ck hoes together
Traded clothes in? state flow together
But now u's a man, you say you gotta plan
Under God and wanna put your life all in his hands
And that's cool, plus I hear you got a boo in these street
You been datin for months, and see her five days a week
But you lookin to tie the knot it's gettin crazy deep
Said you want me to be the best man, it made we weep
I was his best man
Lord knows I'm wrong, I've been sippin on Patron real hard
And he was my best friend
Gotta bring it to an end, and I don't even know how to start
And it was his girlfriend
But now it's his wife, so what we had together was trife
So I don't know if I can
Be a man and tell the truth, I'll walk away with guilt for life
Man it's crazy that my nigga got a broad ya dig
Thinkin bout her gettin married, a nice car and crib
Bein a wife, picket fence man, life's just a glimpse
But put it all together and it all make sense
I get a knock at the do, must be my baby to be
Nice broad, you A&Rin for a label or three
I ain't seen her in some months now, ready to get punched down
But when I answer she lookin funny and hunched down
What's wrong with you? Is the question I lay
She say she feel a little under the weather today
She hadn't been outta town but she had somethin to say
She been lovin up with my homie, not my brotheren mayne
I'm like DAMN could've nearly killed the bitch
Now I'm thinkin of every way that I could filter this
Done over by a beezy that was some filthy shit
But I ain't the type to play the guilty trick
I was his best man
Lord knows I'm wrong, I've been sippin on Patron real hard
And he was my best friend
Gotta bring it to an end, and I don't even know where to start
And it was his girlfriend
But now it's his wife, so what we had together was trife
So I don't know if I can
Be a man and tell the truth, I'll walk away with guilt for life
Now I'm hearin that there's gonna be some problem in the streets
When you see me cause this nigga had the nerves to bump his gums to my motha
So tell me what he really wanna do
I got milli's I got phillies matter of fact a whole brigade muthaf*cka
So nigga when you see me you gon see me
I ain't never been a bitch, that's on my momma so believe
I ain't duckin, and we can get em up on 27
You can trust I got the rap for you suckas
But when I think about it, man we cooler than that
We shouldn't let a bitch come between what me and you had, a pact
Like niggas over bitches, money over hoes
And not to let a scandalous bitch step on our toes
These hoes now is way too vicious
Days and times we livin in is way too different
Bitches go out they way just to make you slip
So niggas watch ya hoes, cause they sickness
I was his best man
Lord knows I'm wrong, I've been sippin on Patron real hard
And he was my best friend
Gotta bring it to an end, and I don't even know where to start
And it was his girlfriend
But now it's his wife, so what we had together was trife
So I don't know if I can
Be a man and tell the truth, I'll walk away with guilt for life
