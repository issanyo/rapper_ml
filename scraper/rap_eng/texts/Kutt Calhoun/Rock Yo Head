[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Let's drink 'til the liquor gone
Don't think, get the swisha blown
So when a stink trick hit yo phone
Say, "Bitch, lemme get my kick it on!"

[Hook]
Rock yo head to the beat, yeah
Everybody rockin', understand what I said
Rock yo head, rock yo head
Stop my bread I'mma rock yo head, nigga
Rock yo head, rock yo head
Rock yo head, I'mma rock yo head
Rock yo head, rock yo head
Stop my bread I'mma rock yo head

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Jordan on my tennis shoe
Organ yelling "Gimmie you!"
Scoring the foreign chick
Got her whoring in her Jimmy Choo
Pour until my Henny through
Your men weak as Winnie Pooh
Ignoring foreign chicks not
Affording niggas any-who

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Kutty got the thing on lock like Yoda
Middle of the floor
With your girl bent over
Two cups, two bottles
Left hand on my logo
Right hand on my stick
Twit' pic for the photo
Makzilla

[Verse 3: Makzilla]
I got the girls
All around the world
Why's that?
'Cause I'm making toes cu-u-u-url
When I beat it they say I really need it
I spit game like my name's E-E-E-Earl

[Verse 4: Krizz Kaliko]
I'mma be Kali Baby until they come'n get me
8-1-6, that's whats wrong wit me
Tryin' to see how much money this song gon' get me
I said Rock yo Head, gon' Rock Rock wit me

[Hook]
Rock yo head to the beat, yeah
Everybody rockin', understand what I said
Rock yo head, rock yo head
Stop my bread I'mma rock yo head, nigga
Rock yo head, rock yo head
Rock yo head, I'mma rock yo head
Rock yo head, rock yo head
Stop my bread I'mma rock yo head

[Verse 5: Makzilla]
Goodah, Goodah, Scratch, Scratch
Dome, Don't mess with it
Fuck what I'm saying
Then invest wit' the vest wit' it
Shout-out to DJ Khaled when we screamin
We the Best with it, Hit em with the lyrical skill like I'm possessed with the Ces in it

[Verse 6: Krizz Kaliko]
If you get it, that mean you said something you regretted
But if you get beheaded, then you never should have said it
This is head banger's ball, break your neck to this, rock until your spine
Outta socket shake it like a pocket rocket
Okay!

[Verse 7: Tech N9ne]
Tech is spray
When the re-uh-record play
Make me really wanna catch a fade, I'mma check it babe, if we saturate
That brigade, that is retro-blade
You just afraid, Tech of what your nigga 'bout to pay

[Verse 8: Kutt Calhoun]
And if he ever say we didn't give 'em an effort way
Out of drama, then his momma gonna reflect on his better days
2Pac re-incarnated, this aided the F & K
Went to Mary, said, "Set em straight wish he'd of fled away"

[Hook]
Rock yo head to the beat, yeah
Everybody rockin', understand what I said
Rock yo head, rock yo head
Stop my bread I'mma rock yo head, nigga
Rock yo head, rock yo head
Rock yo head, I'mma rock yo head
Rock yo head, rock yo head
Stop my bread I'mma rock yo head

[Verse 9 : Makzilla, Krizz Kaliko, Kutt Calhoun & Tech N9ne]
Bringing this dope, but I brought no feds
I don't mess with phony niggas that got no creds
Yeah on this album there be a lot more sin, like
Don't be fucking around with white loafs' bread
Hey, you can find me up in the spot so red
And if you disrespect me you getting shot so dead
I'm gonna be chilling up at the top, no meds
Like Reggie Denny I'm gonna rock yo head!

[Hook]
Rock yo head to the beat, yeah
Everybody rockin', understand what I said
Rock yo head, rock yo head
Stop my bread I'mma rock yo head, nigga
Rock yo head, rock yo head
Rock yo head, I'mma rock yo head
Rock yo head, rock yo head
Stop my bread I'mma rock yo head

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
8-1-6 Boyz! Ain't we sick boy!
Well, ain't we?
Quick to get your girls panties!
Hoes!
