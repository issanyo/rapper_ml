(Verse)
Some people wear their miff with them to walk the straight arrow
It’s pathetic what we take for granted gotta be more careful
Ignoring all the signs of mental illness isn’t helpful
When the thread is made to take a life we need to be more careful
There’s monsters out among us that we keep around our youngsters
A walking time bomb with a disorderly dysfunction
Set to blown them self and anyone to kingdom come
I say to all they say that in Connecticut they mourning
Let’s start the top of the morning he killed his mama at home
Then mosey just went on over to Sandy Hook with a gun
This next stack is unthinkable
Only the devil could relate with such a unfeasible
Even as he proceed it too
First his mother he knows his father never been with him
So he proceed to finish it with the others
27 the murder, this massacre wasn’t heard of
20 k to 4th graders stacking under the covers
Mothers, sisters and brothers and daddies who won’t recover
Puzzled from all the chaos who never thought they would bury
They young child now they gotta make amends early
Cause a coward had decided he was God, judge and jury

(Hook)
Goodbye, hello and goodbye
Our life is just one big hello and goodbye
Hello and goodbye bye, hello and goodbye
Life is just one big hello and goodbye
Hello and goodbye

(Verse)
Just signed a million plus deal you’s a football star
Finally made it well at least you’re with the football squad
But off the field, you can’t see ’cause you don’t look that far
And took the troubles of your woman home you shook that off
With your lady and your baby should’ve took that cross
Inhaled it high above your family but you put that off
You let the demon and the fiend once you consumed that thought
Guess it was Curtis from there who ever knew that father
Would snap after an argument knowing you in the wrong
Your woman’s pleading the case ,she gotta face it alone
A common every day problem that happens to lots of homes
When somebody cheating you either stay with them or keep it going
Not your typical weekend the hardest week in the scorning
The evil in him is speaking, his pact with Jesus is torn
Responsible for his actions the rap shit used to come
And he headed to grab the gun and committed the murder 1
If only I can imagine the realization of doom
The flash from a certain wound ,little girl in the other room
Aftermath of a cruise set sinning hideous fool
Would forth along and everything would lose so what do we do
Fleeing with what he knew with the consequences above him
Life a prison ended his well thinking is flooded
Gun at his temple telling his people oh how he love ‘em
He took a life and chose to return the favor and welcomed

(Hook)

(Verse)
Marty crib both go out to the incidents just mentioned
Don’t let it question your faith in almighty ’cause this is his
Moment where belief has the strongest to convictions
Bare with them as we say a prayer for these victims
Can I get everyone to bow their heads
Dear Lord we come to you in the most harness of times
Asking for your guidance for we do not know where they’re headed
And protection from those who have malice intent to do us harm
Lord we ask that you watch over the fallen victims of this tragedy
And bless the families with insurance of a better place that children once called home
In your son Jesus name we pray, Amen

(Bridge) x2
One day you’re here
And the next day you’re simply gone away
It’s like hello and goodbye
Cause tomorrows never promised anyway

(Talking: Kutt Calhoun)
This song wasn’t meant to offend the families of the victims
Nor it was meant to offend the families of the accused
This song was composed to shed life on the reality of the madness we have going on today
So whatever you believe in just know the higher power is in control
Blessings and prayers sent your way, sincerely Kutt Calhoun
We love you

(Hook) x2
