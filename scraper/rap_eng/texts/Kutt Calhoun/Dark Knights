[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
Somebody gotta tell me why my pockets ain’t lined with nothing
Got me contemplating about doing a crime or something
I think about it three weeks, and all that I could come up with
Is liquor store hold-ups, back to drinking O.E
Lights about to get shut off, gas tank is on E
And my bitch is on my heels, but this ain’t where she want to be
Nigga, I can do better, keep running through my mind and
And now I’m locked in this room on some solitary confine shit
Plottin’ a quick come up, and thinkin’ ‘bout where my kid’s next meal gon’ come from
And nigga then it hit me, all I need is a costume and mask to conceal this
Bring up massive destruction as this bad superhero
Days late to complete, with a kay drape in the feet
And a AK for the heat, not a safe place in the streets
Thinkin’ payback’s sweet and it’s time to punish y’all
Standing at the mirror as the bloodhound, underdog

[Hook: Brotha Lynch Hung]
I don’t want to, do the things I do
Why would I want to, do these things to you
Yeah, I’ma have to get bloody buddy
Motherfuckers won’t love me
I could really get ugly muddy
Silly like that putty Kutty
We gon’ have to get bloody plucky
Knocking him out like we go, he know, he go
Hard like mad niggas, bad superhero

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I can't afford to go small
Either get nothing or get it all
Think about it, turned around
Finished 'em all
Wrong night to work the late shit
Escape with two trash bags full of cash
Stabbed to the pad, hop the stash bag fully macked
Ready to do another
Getting easier and easier
The moment I shot a brother, didn't even think of reasoning
Masquerade through the street, as I lurk in the night shadows
Pickin' em one by one like a pimple
And uh-oh there's one heading toward the door toward me
Had to asphyxiate the strong one
Cause she was a screamer
Lay down the red bandana
Stamped with a paw print over her face
Start leaving the trademark
As I pick up the keys to her car
Tomorrow nights first priority
I concur to take it from the rich
And give it to myself, because I'm sure I deserve it
I used to feel worthless, somehow I feel fit that
Now I'm serving my purpose, bloodhound, underdog

[Hook]

Verse 3 (Brotha Lynch Hung)
It's Mr. nine one siccness, most niggas ain't get they dick split
Bitches ain't gettin they clit bit
Intimate to gettin it rippin' it infinite leavin a nigga impotent
In a funny way it gets me lit like it's the creeper through the night, CATCH ME
Speaking with your wife, catch me
Sleeping with your wife, catch me
Eating up your wife, catch me
Eating up the night
I'm onicuous I'm straight sicc as shit
You better believe it like Ripley's I'm a have a hissy fit; and it's strictly a bitch
And they give me a kick out of it then I'm about to get out of here bendin up fifty quick!
I smoke like 50 zips... Kutt give me the clip
Wow! Ooh!
I'm just killing em up with Calhoun!
I paid dues and it didn't get me shit
Niggas is dreaming I'd get to cleaning and leaning up out of the beamer, they bleeding
I'm 'bout to be eatin this evening and I hate to deceive 'em
Some people say that's it's evil I just say that's it's me though: I see dead people

[Hook]
