Hey, why every time a nigga step up in this bitch
You is hollerin about somethin, complainin about somethin
I'm wantin a hot suckle, or maybe a little relaxation
But I can't win for losin, so I'm losin my patience with ya
You still be cool, but all me do now is fuss and fight
You got me drinkin from Hennessey bottles every night
I tune you out so a nigga won't put his hand on you
You knowin just the button to push, but I'll be damned women
If I end up goin to jail catchin a BV
Because I threw you into the TV (Bitch)
For thinkin you had the nerve to step up in my space
And look me square in the eye, and smack me in my face, you got me fucked up
Act like a man, and I'm gon fight you like a man
And girl you make a nigga wanna run away
So when I'm fixin to walk up out the door
Don't you be followin me man
And bitch you better put that fuckin gun away, man I swear girl

[Chorus:]
You make a nigga not wanna stay
With the way that you behave (Run away)
Tell me girl what is wrong
Before you say I did you wrong and I (Run away)
Everything you need girl is here
And everything you want to make it appear
So tell me girl what's wrong here
Before I (Run away) before I (Run away)

[Skatterman:]
She sayin that's wrong, this is wrong, what the fuck is goin on?
I'm the only nigga that you know that's always fuckin home
With the kids, drop off, pick ups, bitch what
I could be down at the strip club gettin my dick sucked
Naggin and complainin steady sayin I don't do
Don't talk about the niggas steady sayin they want you
Well if you're listenin get closer to the speaker
If you let the nigga freak ya he can keep ya
Cause I ain't into tampered with pussy hoe, playin a fool
Leave the studio early, get the kids outta school
I do the baseball practices, and parent/teachers conferences
Hospital bvisits and karate, all that nonsense
Payin down the car note and droppin the rent
If you think the grass is greener over there, hit the fence
I'd be lyiin if I told you that you wouldn't be missed
But shit, this is it and you ain't gettin a cent

You make a nigga not wanna stay
With the way that you behave (Run away)
Tell me girl what is wrong
Before you say I did you wrong and I (Run away)
Everything you need girl is here
And everything you want to make it appear
So tell me girl what's wrong here
Before I (Run away) before I (Run away)

[Kutt Calhoun:]
I should've took Skatters advice when he was givin the ups on ya
Instead I was a hard head and steady pushed up on ya
I found out you ignorant, and fowl when belligerent
Now how did I enter in this child like predicament
Your whole family don't like, and that's a bad thang
Your own friends tell you that you're lucky to have me
But when I'm threw then I'm through with ya
Won't have nuthin to do with ya
And it ain't gettin through to ya is the sad thang
We used to Blockbuster movie it up, hug and get nudie and cut
All in the moodie for love (moodie for love)
But now there's lots of fuck you's when I come
Verbal abuse to the one that wanted to father you son
I figure I'm a take the exit route
And leave everything I remember to my exit house
Seems like I was just checkin in but now I'm checkin out
Hope you find someone to make you happy, I guess, I doubt bitch

You make a nigga not wanna stay
With the way that you behave (Run away)
Tell me girl what is wrong
Before you say I did you wrong and I (Run away)
Everything you need girl is here
And everything you want to make it appear
So tell me girl what's wrong here
Before I (Run away) before I (Run away)
