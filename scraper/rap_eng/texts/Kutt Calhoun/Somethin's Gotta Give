[Intro: Kutt Calhoun and Tech N9ne]
Hello? Whassup up nigga. Ah shits slow motion man. I know shit's been fucked up since we been on tour man, you now what I'm saying. You ain't really happy about the way shits been going but we bout to hit this road again man, get some more of this skrill, you feel me. It sound good man but you know shit, the fans ain't feeling this shit nigga, you know make a nigga wanna go back to hustlin' you know what I'm saying man. Time gets hard out here nigga you know I'mma do what I gotta do dawg foreal

[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
I crawl up from under a rock and I dust my shirt off
Stagger my pants and proceded to wipe my smirk off
Cause what I saw was something crazed
This cold world done forced me back into my evil ways
I asked the lord for forgiveness but I don't think he hear me
Every single time I reach in my pockets I come up empty
The fans don't make a difference when they solely on that Tech shit
So I ain't gotta choice but to rejoice and let the Tech spit
Let my nuts fall I'm thugging
I bust off in public
Ain't no mercy up in these streets because its rough, raw, and rugged
Don't help when the D.F.C.F steady kickin' down my door
My baby mama's on some bullshit tryin' to raise the child support
Walking tall in my hard hat, trying to protect my brain
And I'm pulling esayall to keep my mama off the cain, it's so insane
I'm feeling reckless doing your body harm
I wear my bitches as a necklace and your life is in a jar
But something's gotta give!

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Kutt Calhoun]
Kutty, I'm 'bout to take you state to state
Make some cake you don't have to wait for the paper chase
Something's gotta give!
Bloody, we contemplate to make you great
Don't make mistakes and make this day tryna make your way
I said something's gotta give!
Kutty, I'm 'bout to take you state to state
Make some cake you don't have to wait for the paper chase
Something's gotta give!
Bloody we contemplate to make you great
Don't make mistakes and make this day tryna make your way
Something's gotta give!

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Money by all means is the mission
Going all out cause I can't feed my seeds with the wishing
Young, black, and I'm gifted
But don't match the description
Of some rap that you listen to
Don't grab your attention
I'm up against a cliff man
And can't fall off cause I'm too close to the edge
Gotta do something for bread
I need some wind beneath my feet
Can't pretend that this is sweet
Right or wrong search high and low I need some ends to make it meet
So don't talk to me about hell when I'mma product of these streets
I got death and jailegy from more these products from these streets
And which ever ones in stored for me I'd prolly be at peace
So at night I pray to God hoping before I fall asleep
Make it better for my children and a new life for my mother
A blessing from you truly and a father for my brothers
And if this music pay me like it supposed to watch us live
Cause if it don't then I might be going postal screaming
Something's gotta give!

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Kutt Calhoun]
Kutty, I'm 'bout to take you state to state
Make some cake you don't have to wait for the paper chase
Something's gotta give!
Bloody, we contemplate to make you great
Don't make mistakes and make this day tryna make your way
I said something's gotta give!
Kutty, I'm 'bout to take you state to state
Make some cake you don't have to wait for the paper chase
Something's gotta give!
Bloody we contemplate to make you great
Don't make mistakes and make this day tryna make your way
Something's gotta give!
