[Verse 1]
Ever since I could remember as a kid was in the mirror
With a hairbrush in my hand and singing other people's lyrics
Memorizing every word and play the role like I was them
Puttin' on a show for uncle Larry fresh up out the pen
Wasn't nothing like today's rappin' cast, 'cause see back then
They was authors of the stories they was telling with the pen
Never rating, I related to the shit that they was saying
Gave me somewhat of a goal I could achieve when I began
Started beating on the tables killing cyphers with my friends
Every rapper I went up against I always seemed to win
Telling stories like I only knew creative such a boy
And I owe it all to Spice 1, Quik and Geto Boys
So I'm only paying homage

[Hook]
I'm singing this for the lost
In their honor, in their honor
I'mma drink this drink and pour a little
In their honor, in their honor
Keep hustling, making money and smoking
In their honor, in their honor
Keepin it hood and understood
In their honor, in their honor

[Verse 2]
Whatever happened to the content in a song when you heard it
No more substance cause the subject by itself is now diverted
Off these random rappers spitting random lyrics with no meaning
Here today and gone tomorrow then a new one to repeat it
That's why I'm still around and got some shoes to put my feet in
Cause the memories of what I say will always be perceiving
It don't matter if it's heart filled or hood related tales
Whatever's cooking in my kitchen I bet everybody smells
See it's all about relating with the people of the world
Who can appreciate to hear when they ain't got a voice to hear
They view it through your music as some means to an end
2Pac and E-40, Ice Cube, because of them
This is why I'm paying homage

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So if I had a list of rappers present day to validate
It would be Eminem and T.I. and the legend Dr. Dre
Nas, Kanye West and B.o.B., Lupe and UGK
And Outkast play a part and while I still can keep the faith
I just hope I'm on that list 'cause I'm inspired by the greats
I'm determined to return this music back to when it made
People wanna buy your music cause you got something to say
The most powerful influence shouldn't be going astray
And if you all agree throw up your 2 so we can pray
That this a necessary mess that we been hearin' is not the way
So give it up to Curtis Blow, LL, Big Daddy Kane
Just the few that pioneered  this, I won't let it be in vain
And that's why I'm paying homage

[Hook]
