You can't fuck with me, no one in your clique trusts me
I'm too pen sick lovely, that's why your bitch fucks me
You can't fuck with me, no one in your clique trusts me
I'm too pen sick lovely, that's why your bitch fucks me

Put your drinks up if you the realest nigga in here
G'st nigga in here, cleanest nigga in here
Live'est nigga in here, richest nigga in here
Now just point your finger at the bitchest nigga in here

New motto for this year if ain't me you're losing'
Album will never profit if it ain't me you're choosing
Strange is the music, gang is the deuces
Lyrics are in the streets, you know I'm claiming Soo Woo shit

Man he's the new shit, naw I'm just the true spit
Cut from a different cloth, and I'm tying up all my loose ends
Separate myself from the old chains and nooses
Cause honestly these cats in this rap things are nuisance

Lil boys boys think its a game, until I lose them
Hanging for everybody to witness how I abuse them
And I'm talking to anybody out there in the music
Want it then i can give it to you wild wind exclusive
Hello
Yea Kutty Kut they gotta feel you man
You childs play
They dun wanna see how you doing out here on these bricks
You childs play
I guess you a magician doin a disappearing act
You childs play
But you really live (and a/ in a ?) You know what I'm talkin about?

I rap circles around ninety five percent of these actors
Holding screen plays cause they playing the role of a rapper
I respect you niggas business but your talent is laughter
These record labels settin you niggas up for disaster
Send you out as just the sheep amongst the wolves just shook
Your whole swag, pride, watches, and your rings is took
I would degrade you as a man in front of family and loved ones
Took niggas from the block to show that you never hugged one
Dun make me call out names on this song, it's not healthy for your image
Fan base is not ready for your gimmicks to be exposed like oco wanna be dboys got you niggas trembling dont i, fuckin with me boy
Show you what its like to be a kansas city diplomat
Politickin thru the hood, and they dun make a script for that
Be careful when you start puttin your mouth on where your dick is at
Blowing yourself away, you only help me not to kill your ass

I guess you got just a don game goin on man
You childs play
Cause it seems like you blowing up the spot, ya feel me
You childs play
They better know what your street cred mean man
You childs play
And stay (dime on them on the bricks?) you feel me my nig?
