[Verse 1]
Damn is this what Bigge and Pac died and looked for to
A bunch of you niggas swagged out dressin' like whores do
Callin' niggas your hubby rappin' hot bitch like girls do
I just had to kick back and soak all this in for a few
Niggas doing the nae nae and moving their hips like bitches
And the sad thing is, these woman ride along side these niggas
Like they're twerkin it but they bestie
These hoes must be gettin' desperate
And everybody's are cool with it like being gay is new sexy
What happen to being a man
Grabbin' your dick and bobbing your head
When your song come on
Holdin' up for your drink and holla your set
This day, these niggas put one hand and wobble their neck
At the same time settin' skinny jeans
Wearin' silk all over their chest
Wanna look hard with the dreads but these about tough shit
I swear to God, in a minute
Next thing these niggas be gettin' butt licks
Believe you me, that this shit keep goin' on, y'all can trust it
And this is what a young nigga supposed to look up to?
I'm disgousted

[Hook]
(Boy!)
Ain't your daddy ever taught not to be
In the streets playin' with girls
(And this is I gon' get it)
Ain't your mama never raised you
How to be a proper men in this world
(I guess that I gon' get it)
This is the state of emerge and see
All across the fifty states of emergency
Callin' all real niggas to the plate
No discretion when I say "this is state of emerge and see"

[Verse 2]
Let's be honest, this niggas in full blown dresses out broad day public
But as soonest they lay their record
Claimin' they're straight thuggin'
I don't know if it's the illuminati, got 'em out their body
Something's in the water
Turnin' these brothers in young daughters
Strictly have forsake us, nigga you's a straight sucker
Doin' anything for that fame, huh? Sold your soul for a chain, huh?
Homie that lifestyle have to change up
Walkin' different now talkin' different that asshole got banged up
You would think you gonna be under pin
For fifteen years the way you've damed up
Let me put this shit in lanes, you's a boy Damien
Don't be talkin' about you shoot this
And you killed that, when you ain't nigga
Soo-woo when you can't kill a cold with a Z Pack
The only time when you pack's wearin' clothes spaghetti strapped
Now you get the pictures? Stupid little nigga
Got that ass on blast, if I can help it
Ain't nobody gonna listen to a nigga with a vaj
Plus I know a whole lot of a female to got nuts this bigger than you
That's on my mama, niggas better realize
What Kutty sayin' is the truth
When he be like...

[Hook]

[Outro]
At the end of the day, you can do what the fuck you wanna do
And be who you wanna be
I won't knock nobody for whatever gender they are
I'm talkin' to these people out there
That's perpetrating to be hard and gangster
But on the other side doin' some different shit man
You got skeletons fallin' out that motherfucker
You're scared to be yourself
And all I'm sayin' man that shit ain't gangsta
Black Gold!
