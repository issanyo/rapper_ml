[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
When you catch a nigga lying they yell
See what had happened was
Thought this was some fire you sell
See what had happened was
Said it was some kush, this reggie
See what had happened was (x3)
I would’ve had your back last night
See what had happened was
You see me 'bout to get in that fight
See what had happened was
Looked around you wasn't nowhere on sight
See what had happened was (x3)
You said your girl’s partner is with it
See what had happened was
I found out she only do bitches
See what had happened was
Nigga why you lying to kick
See what had happened was (x3)
Say everything was up to date so we rolling
See what had happened was
Why you panic when police pull us over
See what had happened was
Come to find out this vehicle’s stolen
See what had happened was (x3)

[Hook]
Er’body talking about what they doing

Er’body talking about what they doing
Then they gonna lie about what they say
Er’body talking, Er Er’body talking (2x)
Er’body talking about what they doing
Then they gonna lie about what they say

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Be quiet, ’cause all of you niggas be lying
But when you call it wanna turn around and deny it
Trying to be something you not
Just keep it real off the top
The judge sentence you to do ten
See what had happened was
You said you had it down on yo end
See what had happened was
I heard you was a chick in the pen
See what had happened was (x3)
I thought you move them bricks for a living
See what had happened was
I heard you went and snitched on a nigga
See what had happened was
The paperwork he had said different
See what had happened was (x3)
Damn bro you claim that fire
See what had happened cuz

See what had happened blood
Nigga how you gonna switch sides?
See what had happened cuz

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
Now you bitches do it too mayne don’t get it twitted
Be lying when you know you all up in a nigga bid'ness
Hootin' and hissin' and, voicemail listenin'
Facebook checking his tweet and mention shit
Thought you said our love was unique
See what had happened was
Trust me everyday of the week
See what had happened was
So why you going through my phone when I'm sleep?
See what had happened was (x3)
You said you don’t see no other guy
See what had happened was
But why you got yo phone on silent?
See what had happened was
I answered and a nigga replied
See what had happened was (x3)
I thought that we was tight for sure
See what had happened was
You said you never liked the courts
See what had happened was
But you putting me on child support
See what had happened was (x3)
