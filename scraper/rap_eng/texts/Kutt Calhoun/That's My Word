Intro
Seven on the beat
Black gold
Ya know a wise man once told me
You tell somebody you gonna do something
You need to make sure you do it
And I just wanna let everybody know that I love
And that I appreciate thanks for looking out for me
A couple of things for my heart
Like this

(Hook)
I know I made alot of money since I’ve been known
But you’ve been around since times was poor
Don’t wanna have a mess but behind be more
I’m here to let you know what is mine is yours
Say that’s my word, that’s my word
That’s my word, that’s my word
Say that’s my word, that’s my word
That’s my word, that’s my word

(Verse 1)
Since the beginning it could’ve been you but it was me
We were inseparable manage the way we ran the streets
I give my life for you just as easy as you for me
Thank god this music was in us now we can chase our dreams
We ran, to the booth to rapping was a hotter wait
24/7 monday to sunday was our escape
But I got on and I ain’t forgot about my long time friend
Who would kill em just for looking at me wrong so
If I’m on top then we’re on the top call it Even Steven
Got more belief in my nigga than what they had in Jesus
And with that said just with every step brings it closer Jeezy
To what we’re striving for nigga realest then rest in pieces

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
You couldn’t think for a second without you and my daughter
I would’ve made it this far and let alone even farther
Since I’ve been ritch all my life is blossom our blessings came
Got me the family I never had ,what a precious thing
When I go to the Lord and thank Him every day
For what he brought into my life He tells me everything’s ok
This so again because through the struggle and pain
I’m rich from happiness truly no money is not a thing
Rather I’m rich or poor a KC strip of porridge
What I got left in the balance it’s principles and morals
And I would never put nothing before what I adore
So that’s a promise I plan to keep signed , truly yours

(Hook)

(Verse 3)
To every fan accumulated in theese years of the making
Know your support is what kept me on to achieving greatness
I stand to chase it no longer sketchy I feel complacent
Will never sellout cause what I own for has no complacent
So I'm off, without a worry on my mind
And with a push from all of you it ain't no need to look behind
I fell down every mirror time to focus on my drive
It's the blood inside of you that keep the heart of me alive
Don't think for a second you're not considered a world respected
When I get my mama a house for her mother's day present
When she accepted I tell her the fans said welcome
And that goes double for me so don't you ever forget it

(Hook)
