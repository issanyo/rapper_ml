[Intro]
A coward dies a thousand deaths, but a soldier dies once. It is written, warfare is the greatest affair of state, the basis of life and death, the way to survival or extinction, therefore structure it according to the following five factors: Tao, Heaven, Earth, General and Laws

[Hook]
With the spirit of God in me
I'll come back from the dead
As a lyrical prodigy
Taking aim at the threads
Of the people who buried me
Now it's off with they heads
Lay him under the guillotine
Let the chopping commence

[Verse 1]
Yeah, back from the dead
But what became is a newer me
Left a crack in my head
My nigga ain't the same as he used to be
Escaped, capture and fled
Left behind the pain and the jewelry
Now it's off with their head
For trying speak down on my name at the eulogy
Ahh, yeah, told y'all niggas
You can kill flesh but can't hold my spirit
Put a thorn crown on my head and then left me for dead
(Shocked!) When I rose like Jesus
Now death becomes you
Behold, any aspects left will crumble
But tried to be humble
But karma comes back tenfold
Slapped you, it was fresh was from you
This ain't me no more, it's the chief talking, doing God's work
I hear the streets talking, but the streets rocking like a concert
And by that I mean, all that hard shit is gone converse
Is this real nigga, causing I am living it, and I'm damn willing to put God first
So I'm the bomb first, anything that happens believe it been prayed on
Nothing but death and destruction, coming like a thief in the night when we wait on
When that soul rise and my face appears in their eyes, I'mma stay strong
Better watch how you play with me, then I'mma suffer them out from the s√©ance

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Tomahawk chopping, bit by bit, in the way of my obstacles
I rise to occasions, when nay-sayers say it's impossible
They wanna hold me down, underwater long with no oxygen
But what's that to a shark, I'mma eat niggas like a main course lobster meal
Yeah, Like Nat G-E-O, Black Gold in here with a black CEO
Smack y'all niggas with a hashtag we on
I'm unforgettable, Nat King C-ole
Y'all forgot about me, well here, let me remind you
Punch in a route to find me, GPS ho says I'm right behind you
With a bone to pick, (I'll) never let a nigga do me wrong again
Said y'all rappers all child's play, now I vow to say, I'm on grown up shit
Like Miley Cyrus, you ain't gotta like you, but you gotta respect me
This is my Yeezy moment, and I'll interrupt anybody who'll let me
Plant the flag down in my city soil, and let the roots grow
Struck black gold and it's shooting high so let the roof blow
This KC nigga, strictly a fuck you, pay me nigga
No coast legend, like Will Smith, I'mma do it all, by my lonely to say what's living, ahh

[Hook]

[Outro]
Behold, I come like a thief. Blessed is he that watches, and keepeth his garments, so that he doesn't walk naked, and they see his shame
