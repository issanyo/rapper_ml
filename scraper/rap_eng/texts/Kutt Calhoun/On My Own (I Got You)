I'm on my own now, oh
Picking up the pieces, I did it for a reason
I'm on my own now, oh
It's for the people, I got them fiending
I got what you want
Yea I got you, I got you, I got you
I got what you want
Yea I got you, I got you, I got you

[Verse 1]
Busted, disgusted and looking ugly is how I was 'posed to feel when I left the label I fucked with
Niggas thought I was bluffing 'til Kutty up and did something
Be damned if I stuck around and get treated like I was nothing
Especially since I been around before this label was torchin'
Started out in the basement creating dancing moves on the porches
Before this shit became a job we was humble and all enjoyed it
Definitely before the distance between us and making Forbes list
I had a revelation, Kutt I don't think they hear you
I finally see my future, Strange Music wasn't in it
I got down on my knees and asked the Lord for forgiveness
He brought me out the darkness with a whole new beginning
Now, now I got my label in tact and who got my back is who matters
Back with a vengeance, I'm in this, plus dissolving the chatter
I'm 'bout my business, these middle fingers to all who done fathom
Me falling off without Strange, I tell them all when they asking

[Verse 2]
Never did they give a nigga a reason to leave a brother out in the cold
When it came to voicing opinions, get it off of your chest I was told
So went a couple songs with the meaning, made a lot of people question my growth
With the label I'm with now the meaning was the number one motive they chose
Okay, let that be the reason, those false allegations got old
If you ain't man enough to man up, you stand up with a hand up your ass and get told
What to do, what to say, what to wear, who to talk to so damn passive it shows
Wonder how a nigga losses respect, it ain't hard when you ain't in control
And I'm a rebel, refusing to show alliance
Resisting any authority, known to react to violence
Record exec's are flustered, can't hush him or keep him quiet
Cause a phoenix rise from the ashes, new life is after you die (feel me)
I got my head on, if you've ever been led on
Thinking something it's not, well then I'm that nigga to bet on
Peep the weakness it's sorted, I packed my bags and I set on a mission to bring the truth to the light and tell you what Mel on, nigga

[Hook: Demond Jones]

[Verse 3]
So since I left it's been on me, to do it, all by my lonely
I'm the truest, artist you gon' see out on four sides of the country
I put in fourteen plus years in this, know a little something about business
Plus them connects I got will blow your mind
And it ain't got shit to do with spittin' this here
This shit come easy, better ask the last one I was rocking with 'bout how I thread the needle
Cut from my own cloth, now I'm my own boss and that's why Melvin lethal
I got they noses wide open, I tried to tell you people
The biggest statement you can make is never sell your freedom
Reality TV, mixtape, full length album, EP
Black Gold E-N-T got he and she and everybody else caught on the weekly
I handle it all discreetly, lining my ducks in a row
No people would hate to see me piling the bucks as I go
So I stack 'em to death, despite of what happened I'm stressed
Free doing business, what you can't see the closed caption projects
Now just follow the story, witness me bring it along
Bet once it's over you'll be singing this song
