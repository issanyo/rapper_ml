[Intro: Spaide R.I.P.P.E.R.]
What's up Stone?
It's yo' boy Spade Ripp
Man fuck these hatin' ass niggas you hear me?
They mad cuz you in it my nigga
You got all the Momentum
You a Rolling Stone out here on these streets
And they mad at you you hear me
And tell em say it with they chest
If they got something to say
Them zombies out here lurkin' on em
Ya know I know you ain't gon' play wit' em
Let em know how you do it

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
I'm a make a nigga jump back
I'm a get em in packs
Relax, detach to the max then I relapse
Made it back with the snake in the back
In fact reach back if a nigga talks smack
Insane in the mothafuckin' brain
Don't care what you claim this shit gon' rain
Vibe for a little cause I ride then a little
Better watch how you say my name, my name
Better watch how you say my name
These homies ain't got no sense
Gotta answer for what you sayin'
In the club and they causin' fits
And they rumble like the Taliban
I'm a grit my teeth and ball up both of my hands

[Hook: Spaide R.I.P.P.E.R.]
This here make me wanna jump
Swing them hands
If you want a problem with me say it like a man
We could take it to the middle of the flo'
If you really wanna go nigga bring it then
If you really wanna tango with me we can dance
This here make me wanna jump
Swing them hands
If you want a problem with me say it like a man
You think you tough I think you bluffin'
Better bring yo' friends
If you really wanna tango with me we can dance
This shit here make me wanna jump

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Homeboy, I ain't givin' two fucks about what you talkin' bout
Told you bitch ass niggas once
Better keep my name out yo' fuckin' mouth
If you speak assisted like I'm the bitch nigga
To get that off on and laugh about
Yo' mouth done wrote a check that yo' ass can't cash
So don't you get mad when I get to pullin' up to yo' house
Smackin' yo' sistas all in they mouth
Turnin' yo' Daddy's pockets into bunny ears
Sayin' literally fuck yo' couch
Got yo' baby mama in the basement cryin'
Sayin' yous a coward no doubt
Got that safe combo, weed stash
And this niggas still hidin' out?
So you fuck with Stone then you fuck with me nigga
Told y'all I'm already kreased in this game
And if it pertains to beef, then it's grilled
Kutt gon' kill for these niggas (Strange)
Way more real than these niggas (gang)
Suh-woo deal on these bitches (Strange)
Got more real than these niggas
To do what they want a Militant nigga
St. Lou Lou, City of Fountains
A body get found by the Arc nigga
Get the work from that Zombie Click
For my nigga Stevie it's dark dinner
Dangerous and rowdy, heartless killaz round me
What they get from out it
And if you feelin' froggy you should jump

[Hook]
