[Verse 1: Snug Brim]
To all my Gs and thugs, rollin' sprees and dubs
Twenty-threes, twenty-fours all go to the rub
At the stoplight, spinning like it still in motion
TVs and DVDs got PD scopin'
Hit the l-store whilst jerking on a jucing yat
We used to that, Duron go ahead and loof the backs
And hit the wash [?]
And [?]
This is the life of [?] KCMO, we ride all night
And if you smoking got some friends and we get high all night
Fuck with Snug guaranteed to get your mind owned right
Plus I'm a star can't you tell the way I shine so bright
Big trucking it
And don't be hating 'cause you see me riding twenty-two [?]
Man big bucking it
Living the life of a hard knock
You got business we can handle it, just meet me at the carwash

[Hook]
Carwash, it's the only place to go
Carwash, where you see players, pimps and hoes
Carwash, it's the only place to be
Carwash, every Sunday in KC

[Verse 2: Skatterman]
A sunny day in my city and I'm ready for 'em
Is it the 'vette or the old skool chevy [?]
Know every boss in the town's about to floss in the town
We do it big, fuck with the cost in the town
Got my next tail poppin' like I still sell dime
But I ain't trippin' off the ring and hit my blood two times
And put myself into a whole 'nother zone
And blow a whole 'nother zone
Before I [?] some Issey cologne
Since I'm a top-notch, fuck it guess I gotta drive the drop top
Just call my dude and the truckers in the chop shop
And it's gon' be there for another two days
Wait till you see it burned orange with the baby blue glace
It's a head-turner, but it's really nothing to a bread earner
Never leave the house without my motherfuckin' lead burner
Now watch me shine like the rocks on my chain
Doing eighty down a motherfucking turning lane
Headed for the

[Hook]
Carwash, it's the only place to go
Carwash, where you see players, pimps and hoes
Carwash, it's the only place to be
Carwash, every Sunday in KC

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
Guess who just got the call
From my boy Snug Brim, they trying to fade my doll
With the stock V6 engine
Spot free, [?] glistening
The twenty-fours got the hoes on my block whistlin'
Come to a halt, but the spreewells ain't gonna stop spinnin'
Seven six [?] on top of the antennas
Lit like a cinema DVD in the center front
Lime green [?] got [?] trying to get in the truck
Greet 'em, but never trust 'em
'cause meeting [?] will lead 'em to rather fuckin' a G with a Bradley custom
The sunny day got razed [?] down on a 2K [?]
I gotta say it's a busy day for the PD
Four hundred motherfucking cars in a twining on the B-Street
With everybody in their wife beats
But it's enough to make a nigga catch a PV fuckin' with the

[Hook]
Carwash, it's the only place to go
Carwash, where you see players, pimps and hoes
Carwash, it's the only place to be
Carwash, every Sunday in KC

[Verse 4: BG Bulletwound]
Who in the block on the drop top stand? (BG)
With them hoes in the back on the [?]
I got the belvian [?] (Who got the weed?)
The homie Snuggy on the way I think he pickin' up Kutt
This be the day for the ghetto hoe
I'm talking weed, ram and real big 6-inch [?]
And plus my dog's [?]
Plus the hoes that I'm ridin' with all charge a twenty to fuck
So I gotta get 'em off in the mix
Get 'em off in the spot where it's hot to let 'em pose for [?]
And let 'em pose on the back of the drum (Where we headed?)
To the sto for some mo' and then we heads to the wash
'cause uh
Bee geezy gone off the heazy
Turning twenties believe me
Play 'em like Joe Cleese
It's not easy when you see the feazy
Doozed out for sheazy
Aw shit he's bleazy

[Hook]
Carwash, it's the only place to go
Carwash, where you see players, pimps and hoes
Carwash, it's the only place to be
