Women on the road, HA
It's funny that you ask me that question man, it's like
You been in so many many cities, so many times like
1 and 2 and 3 years man, and you got this one chick that you may mess with
In each city and they start ta, start to think it can be something more than it is
When in actuality, you got a wife, a girlfriend and a family at home
And you're like baby, it can never be what you want it to be know what I'm sayin
1000 Miles down the road
Tryin to get past go
Baby lovin just ain't my style
When I'm travelin the green mile
You used ta, lay at night in the bed wishin upon a star
You never dreamed you would meet and get with a modern star
The same star you were engulfed in and made you awww
Would be the one laying down beside you butt naked now
Feeling like y'all connected, cause he's so down to Earth and
You love the way he talks to you, he's just a normal person
When he's not on the stage, it's more or less night & day
And you're so amazed by his characteristic ways
That you fall off in fantasy lane, like just what happened
Go dissolve into Dannity Kane but I got news baby
Never stoppin the show, while I steady pocket the dough
We met and auctioned our souls, the sex was awesome but whoa
You think it's smokin aces, but girl my heart is taken
That's something you can't capture over us exchangin faces
This was just for the night, so thanks for checkin the mic
I'm on a shuttle to the airport, I'm catchin a flight
Movin Doin
1000 Miles down the road
Tryin to get past go
Baby lovin just ain't my style
When I'm travelin the green mile
Then you got the ones, that are dedicated solely
Just to you when you in town and want the crown of one and only
They know you're a little better, they flow is a little wetter
You both have been through the weather and closer than 2 together
She know some personal shit, others would hurt to know
Was there before you got big, right in the first of rows
Now she a bottom beezy and know that she got it easy
A V.I.P.I.M.Peezy of keepin you bar ceezy
And you don't mind a repeat cause times is cherishin
Repeat with dimes on different sides of America
Although our time is more interestin than special a
When we endore baby rest assured it was just a nut
You say I drive you crazy, I say ya love to hate me
I also know you wouldn't hesitate to have my baby
So when we through with boinkin, yeah you may feel anointed
But early in the mornin, when I'm gone, then you will know baby I'm
1000 Miles down the road
Tryin to get past go
Baby lovin just ain't my style
When I'm travelin the green mile
HERE'S, to all the women that's grievin and listenin
IN, to what I say and I'm meanin this in the
MOST, sincerest way ain't no keepin this realness
SEALED, I let my cup runnith over I wanna
Congratulate you all, for standin and walkin tall
Firmly on your beliefs, you conquered the chain and ball
When your support was needin, you somely gave it all
With no remorse, not even when fathers and agents call
When others talked about ya, wishin they could be you
The one that walked around with ya, tryin to get with em too
You always held your ground, stayed loyal and never blew
Ya cover when your undercovers lover needs ya too
You love me, no you, love my music and I
Appreciate it, but this, is untrue baby
So when this ends just realize that I loved you all
No offense, but when my duty call, I'm gone travelin
1000 Miles down the road
Tryin to get past go
Baby lovin just ain't my style
When I'm travelin the green mile
