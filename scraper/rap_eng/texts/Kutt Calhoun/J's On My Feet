[Intro: Paul Wall]
What's up Kutt baby? It's Paul Wall
You know how we do it down in Texas riding on the 84's
Why don't you let them boys know how you do it down there in Kansas City
Know what I'm talking bout?

[Verse 1]
You know I'm coming down looking draped up and dripped out
200 for the Gucci jeans iced up and chipped out
150 for the tennis shoes I lace up and dip out
Expensive fits to taste, let it dissolve in your bitch mouth
Fresh out on 'em all, lookin like a tailor made
Manikin from Harold Penn's at the Landing Mall
My Kansas City fitted's to the side cuz I'm a dog
Bandana out my pocket and I'm finna blind em all
I'm tellin you it's nothing, just check out my demeanor
Extra crispy when I step out, I'm a walking talking cleaners
On my way up to the liquor store to purchase me a pleaser
Malibu, 151, pineapple juice and case of beers
The ride look like throw up, and niggas say it's sick
I chuck the deuce when I roll up, and represent the click
I'm gettin down how I know brah, real heavy on a bitch
Me and my niggas all post up, forever on the strip with them

[Hook]
J's on my feet (feet)
Car full of beat (beat)
Trunk full of (heat)
Caribou in the seat
I got (x4)

[Verse 2]
Got a gorilla in my trunk, and he ain't very happy
You don't hear him tryin to get out? That's why your windows crackin
Old ladies on the block threaten us all but we laughing
'Til somebody called the police, cuz niggas started capping
My posse's on Prospect, different location
Motorcading in drops, newbies and Chevy's on the daytons saying
I come through this, whatever that you playing man
So many artists in look like American Band Stand
The sun start to get low, bustas turn to flip mode
Lookin out for enemies with hands on they pistols
It's time to turn your shit low, and listen for the tip toes
Cuz Killa City's known for makin simple threats official
It's murk in the air, so we party with caution
You can't be sure like Al B. when somebody is watching
'Til all of a sudden bells ringin, bodies are dropping
You think I'm crazy, this happens in my area often for them

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let's find a place to meet up, it used to be a Jimmy's
Now when niggas drunk and hungry everybody go to Denny's
By the stadium, and it don't even cost a pretty penny
When you get there, it's like a party everybody in it
Elbow to elbow, niggas connecting tables
Bein loud and obnoxious yellin at all the waiters
And the bitch I used to fuck with, sitting right over there
Now my mind's on some fuck shit, nigga cuz I'm a player
Motioning and gesturing for her to meet the guest you with
I guess that's when she 'membered I'm more flyer than the rest of them
We dipping in the whip now, I told the ho to sit back
She pulling on my zipper, pulled the skipper out and licked that
Made a nigga zig zag, I'm losing all my bearings
Bout to bubble like I'm Aaron, got a suite up at the Clarion
Damn shit is fucked up, before I beat the meat I need the Magnums
Gotta have 'em so I'm smashing out to grab em with the

[Hook]
