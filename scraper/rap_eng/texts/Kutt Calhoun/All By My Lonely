(Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun)
Niggas don't wanna see me shine
I swear to God as my witness, it happens every time
They hate my climb, and block my lime
But lemme tell you this here little light of mine, it's fine
I was born by my God-damned self
Way I see it, I’mma die by my God-damned self
Lord willing, long as I be forgiven myself
I pray to God I’m not a burden for anybody else
Got my own two-step, keep my chin to the sky
All my so-called friends all done moved to the side
Got a drawer full of them bills, they pile sky high
Don't nobody give a damn and I don't care to ask why
That's why I be on a mission, I'm watching my own behind
My future is right in front of me, wifey is on my side
Middle finger to all you niggas who'd rather see me drown
They ain't like a nigga then, but they hate a nigga now
My game's too strong, my flow's too heavy
Ain't a thing slowed down since I first dropped B.L.E.V.E
If this money's up for the taking, then you better never let me
Snatch it down by my God-damned self, I'm ready

(Hook)
Do it all by my lonely
My own family disowns me
Surrounded by a lot of phoney homies
(x2)

(Verse 2: BG Bulletwound)
I feel trapped in it
That's why I'm posted on the block
At the spot with the chops
With the packs in it
Pill bottles filled up
With the crack in it
No more tours for the B
That's why I'm back in it
I'm out'chea
Cause I ain't got nobody
Yeah I hustle for this shit
Cause I ain't got nobody
Ain't no duffle bags
Tossed out, no Maseratis
Ain't no tossing on deals
Bottles and afterparties
Niggas look at you funny
They say he done with it
The same niggas you helped with a brand
And hung with it
See I don't fuck around
Fuck 'em niggas, fuck em now
I keep it moving like public transit
So buckle down
Yeah I'm deuce boy
Yeah I'm the truth boy
Yeah I got family that'll do ya dirty for the loot boy
A cold game in this motherfucker
It's like that
But I win the end homie
Despite that

(Hook)
(x2)

(Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun)
You see, a friend is always there when you ain't got it
As long as you got a true homie, you got an extra pocket
Wrong as you wanna be, they there to help ya fix the problem
All of the phonies be gone when you hitting rock
Fuck em against the wall, they babies don't grow
I'm the last of a dying breed living out the MO
My sucker repellent's on and my balls hung low
And say whatever I want cause real niggas say it's so
You heard I'm a beast, a monster in disguise
Ran as fast as you could, seen the envy in your eyes
Don't wanna see a nigga stack dough and get rich
You'd rather see a nigga flat broke and poor piss
Miss me with the B-U-Double L- shit
And every other hating nigga that you came with
This the "Whom it may concern", sign it to you with my dick
I'mma do it with or without you
Better phone me if I

(Hook)
(x2)

We get it in, we get it out (x3)
You ain't give a nigga shit, get the fuck up off my couch nigga
