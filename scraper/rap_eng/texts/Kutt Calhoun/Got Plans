Got plans? Not going anywhere for awhile?
Or maybe your just waiting on that one brother who can't get right
But can bang that back out all night
And you just wanna let him know what the capital of Thailand is baby
Bangkok, Bangkok

(Kutt)
Come on and ride with me one time and get a dose of this breeze
The top down in this kansas sun, I
Know your attracted to my street persona, a dime piece
But I wouldn't let you meet my mama
Cause you nasty and clashed with classy at the same time
Knew what would happen if I made my approach to meet you
Buckle up (?) home girl can deep throat a diesel. God dwamnnnnn
I got a hot scam, bust a uey take a detor to the bar get you full off of (?)
You telling me you got a hot dance
Well let me see if you can take it the floor
Make it drop and...

Shake what your mama gave ya, so later we can break to ya mamas basement
You let me penetrate, but I can't just lay up
And I love the way you taste, and the face was great
But girl I got plans

Chorus (Krizz Kaliko)
Do you got plans?
Maybe we can hit up a movie and then find a parking lot
Do you got plans?
All im really saying is can I find a way in your in your throbbing spot
Do you got plans?
If not just call me when you want some
Meat, baby call me when your lonesome
Creap, sometime if you want a fun one
Who can bring the thunder, call me on the under

(Kutt)
Right back atcha ain't cheating, you said youd get back for him cheating
So in fact you ain't cheating
Just think of it as a small intermission
And by the way that you look, bet he small in position
Just let me comfort you lady, you been lookin for love in all the wrong the place
