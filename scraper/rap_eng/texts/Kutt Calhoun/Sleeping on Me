[Verse 1]
Yeah, I’m nothing short of a miracle
Reality rap music is in your stereo
If winner’s either fresh bowl of weed is on some cereal
It’s gonna take a whole lot more than some cereals
Yeah, to compete with a phoenix
I rise from my own ashes, if it’s heat nigga bring it
100 % solid and discrete and that’s meaning
I’m one of the missing pieces that the street’s really needing
Cut from a cloth, most of you niggas have not worn
Come from an era, most of you niggas were not born
From a place, most of you niggas cannot soar
Playing the game, well all of you niggas have not scored
If the game getting boring, then admit to that
It won’t take a rocket scientist to admit to that
Every real nigga listening can’t admit the fact
That the industry sleeping on me, I’ma just sit back and say

[Hook]
Wake up, time to rise and shine
You only get to stretch, only clear your mind
Wipe the cold from your eye, let your ears reflect
Time to focus on a nigga you ain’t hearing yet
I’m saying
Wake up, time to rise and shine
You only get to stretch, only clear your mind
Wipe the cold from your eye, let your ears reflect
Time to focus on a nigga you ain’t hearing yet
I’m saying

[Verse 2]
2 time, mvp, strange music I done see
Top 3, independent, record label, I am he
World respected from the state of Maryland, to Wyoming
West coast to down south, you better keep your eye on me
I’m the best you never heard about
From a small city that murdered you for the murder clout
Love you then hate you, especially if you heard about
Word around the industry, niggas is getting nervous now
Wanna know my motives, learned about my resume
Now they wanna politic, don’t want me to delegate
Conditions of the state, hip hop is in to the present day
They ain’t got a choice, I’m here now I’m fin to set them straight
They prolly hate I’m on the radar
Cause now they gotta deal away with skinny jeans and gay bars
And by bars I mean rapping
I’m pulling back the covers off those who’ve been napping


[Hook]
Wake up, time to rise and shine
You only get to stretch, only clear your mind
Wipe the cold from your eye, let your ears reflect
I’m the focus on a nigga you ain’t hearing yet
I’m saying
Wake up, time to rise and shine
You only get to stretch, only clear your mind
Wipe the cold from your eye, let your ears reflect
I’m the focus on a nigga you ain’t hearing yet
I’m saying

[Verse 3]
The cross is the pot, you gonn get
And you know it the closest your block
Is gonna get to a ... that’s close to your watch
Cause time will tell how I show to pick the weakness in this rap game again
And show that I’m the last of a dying breed
Father forgive me, in the presence of my enemies
I swallow and simply as the last supper
Knowing Judas’ over my shoulder
It’s time to ...I’m excluding you motherfuckers
I do this cause I’m going on the limb
For my niggas in the hood or locked down in the pen
And this will be the last time you’ll ever can begin
With the start of something new
Cause I expropriate, expropriate, expropriate the dream
Yeah, I got a message for the rap game
I’m the best think smoking just a crack came
And so you know it just to said it
This is Kutt Calhoun nigga, mid west breaded
