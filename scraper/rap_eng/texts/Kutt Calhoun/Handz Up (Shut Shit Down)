[Hook]
Hands up, somebody better tell these kids
It ain’t safe out here in the streets no more
It’s a war outside with police but it ain’t about peace no more
Young black males losing their lives on city wanna riot
I don’t know about y’all, but shit about to get violent
Police keep on trippin’ and (We gon' shut shit down)
Motherfuckers gon' turn up missing cause (We gon' shut shit down)
Keep on taking out children and (We gon' shut shit down)
Ayy, so you better listen up before we (shut) we gon' (shit) shut shit down

[Verse 1]
Hands up don’t shoot
Cops gonna do what they want to
Ain’t nobody had a motherfuckin’ gun yet
You can play the fool if you want to
A little different when somebody hear sirens, nowadays why, it ain’t peace
Then wonder why my people get violent but it ain’t they child in the state sheets
A young mother got a chill up her spine made the hairs on her neck stand up
The spiritual connection that she had to her son
Made her feel the last breath that he took
She collapsed to her knees
In the middle of the kitchen screaming out, “Lord please, he’s only sixteen!”
Taken by the very same person who would vow to protect by any means
Necessary, I don’t give a fuck if you was holding
Warning shot him in the leg or could have popped him in the shoulder
You a trained killer with the tactics of a soldier
Up against a young adolescent boy who ain’t old enough to even shoot accurate
Yet you wan' attack him with a face shot and leave him closed casket
How about we run up in you house?
Ripping yada and your family member mouth?
On, so get back and shit, niggas in my city want redemption
Not a bitch slap on the wrist with a 2-week suspension
Fuck George Zimmerman
Fuck all racist ass police and anybody else I didn’t mention
Finna be another little Chi-Raq here in Killer City
On the law don’t nobody want to listen
Alvin Brooks, the ad hoc crew against crime can’t save him
If they don’t want the business then get your hands up!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
No justice, it's just us
It’s all them, against us
There’s no peace
Til we all get a piece of redemption the streets won’t get sleep
Til the motherfuckin' deuce of the igginit
Now everybody want to claim real nigga shit
If that’s what it takes to make our presence known (YEET!)
It's about to get real fucking niggerish
Time to round with the partners with the choppers
A nina for a nina, one Villain per copper
A vest for a vest and a scanner for the squadron
In the radius so we can know the rules of engagement
My cries out for help fell on deaf ears
So violence is all that is left here
A lot of people think I’m wrong but if
We don't stand for something imagine what next years
Death toll killers by cops is
Somebody better recognize the plot quick
Kill a young breed, destroy a new future
Wipe threats out, til we fall useful
Knowing that, better get ready for Self Preservation
A model is not fear
Anybody that is weak and dependent on the system
Existence is probably not here
And you ain’t gotta co-sign with it
I just made it public so you know I did it
Voice of the people for the people with no voice
For the people in positions so you know I’m with it
This is for the mothers of the mowed down childrens
That’s victims of the police low down shootin’
This has gotta stop when every known niche
I’m a hard next time I see a motherfucking cop, hands up!
