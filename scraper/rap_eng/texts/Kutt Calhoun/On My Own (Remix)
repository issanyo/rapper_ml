[Hook: Demond Jones]
Im on my own now huh
Picking up the pieces I did it for a reason
Im on my own now huh
This for the people, I got em fiendin

I got what you want
Yeah I got you i got you i got you
I got what you want
Yeah I got you i got you i got you

[Verse 1: VerseBorn]

I got exactly what the
Fiends need when i spit they get
Dope sick the
Definition of clean sneeze

Catch me solo on these
Mean streets the only
Clique i roll with has a full clip
And a mean squeeze

Dolo mission pole position
Switching lanes separating from nighas
7 star dragon ball after
Wishes made

Cursive script from a different page
To each his own my speech is known
To eradicate leaching
Clones and sneaky fakes

From the bay to la
Triangulate that Back Up to east
We steady giving em exactly
What they need

Third eye vision
Took ot world wide with it
Expensive liquor sipping when
I earl my chicken

They slap my hits
Hotboxing a whip or
At a skatepark with niggas
Doing ollies and flips

Im as hot as it gets
VerseBorn ontop of his shit
Not a hobby its a whole conglomerate
So bow and honor the gift

[Hook: Demond Jones]
Im on my own now huh
Picking up the pieces I did it for a reason
Im on my own now huh
This for the people, I got em fiendin

I got what you want
Yeah I got you i got you i got you
I got what you want
Yeah I got you i got you i got you

[Verse 2: Wreck The Rebel]

Riding solo now thats a no-no
Team Konquest just incase you dont know
Wreck The Rebel did you get the memo
Just in case you didn't yo theres different levels

Create the storm but never watch it settle
They blowing steam but never tip the kettle
Wrecking ball and these rocks is pebbles
Silver tongue mouth heavy metal

Running and rapping these niggas in circles
Tell by my circle these niggas is working
Not all about duckets you tell by the rukus
We running the game like we run at the Rucker

Speak on my name and we speak about hunger
Link up with Verse and we talk about supper
Fully hiphop and thats word to they mothers
Sleeping on us we'll tear holes in your covers

Back a ways for like a half a day
I was on the train with a half of grape
I was in the Bay I was feeling great
You know Planet of the fuckin Apes

Let me switch the style cuz the tongue is wild
Tuck the swag cuz its sticking out
KonQuest better ask around
About 50 hippies up at the house

Han Solo- (thats no-no)
With the crew tho (like yolo)
Look at baby (on her own)
What do i do (get her home)

KQ (thats Ozone)
Bird view (now im gone)
You had- your chance
(Now dont call my phone)

[Hook: Demond Jones]
Im on my own now huh
Picking up the pieces I did it for a reason
Im on my own now huh
This for the people, I got em fiendin

I got what you want
Yeah I got you i got you i got you
I got what you want
Yeah I got you i got you i got you

[Verse 3: Kutt Kalhoun]

So since I left it's been on me, to do it, all by my lonely
I'm the truest, artist you gon' see out on four sides of the country
I put in fourteen plus years in this, know a little something about business
Plus them connects I got will blow your mind
And it ain't got shit to do with spittin' this here
This shit come easy, better ask the last one I was rocking with 'bout how I thread the needle
Cut from my own cloth, now I'm my own boss and that's why Melvin lethal
I got they noses wide open, I tried to tell you people
The biggest statement you can make is never sell your freedom
Reality TV, mixtape, full length album, EP
Black Gold E-N-T got he and she and everybody else caught on the weekly
I handle it all discreetly, lining my ducks in a row
No people would hate to see me piling the bucks as I go
So I stack 'em to death, despite of what happened I'm stressed
Free doing business, what you can't see the closed caption projects
Now just follow the story, witness me bring it along
Bet once it's over you'll be singing this song

[Hook: Demond Jones]
Im on my own now huh
Picking up the pieces I did it for a reason

This for the people, I got em fiendin

I got what you want
Yeah I got you i got you i got you
I got what you want
Yeah I got you i got you i got you
