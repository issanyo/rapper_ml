[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Deuce Klik, Big Krizz Kaliko, Tech N9ne, let's go

[Verse 1: Skatterman]
Skatternasty
Ask about me in the streets, got credit like a white man
Strange Music lieutenant, Snug Brim's right hand
Hopping out the white van, got the fully double clutched
Twenty seven shots will make a 80's baby Double Dutch
Travis say I'm fucking up, Tech think I'm a knucklehead
Nah, I'm just a little shell shocked from years of ducking Feds
I cherish nothing but the bread, my gang relation boots up
I'm flame throwing my deuce up, it's Skatter on this crew cut

[Verse 2: Snug Brim]
[?] been one of the [?] that'll snap your neck
You faking, my nigga
I can really give it to you and I'm willing to bet
Could be put off in a situation where, homie, your life could leak
So watch your tongue and your tone, and better know talk is cheap
Let's set this rap shit aside and start speaking the truth
Most of ya hide behind ya lines, what you say in the booth
Ain't got no get back, we keep max, fuck playing with Deu'
You little poo butts, you finna do what?
Nigga take this crew cut

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
From the-from the blocks where we grew up
To the-to the hood that we threw up
You and you and you 'bout to do what?
Running down your lanes with a gang, get a crew cut
Now I know that the Strange got you faded
I know that you saying you're dangerous but save it
We hearing you slanging and banging
Hang with a gang and get a crew cut
Me and my niggas on the same shit

[Verse 3: BG Bulletwound]
This boss shit nigga, Deuce Klik yankee, homie
When I yank these, homie, niggas better thank me, homie
When the crowd clear I'ma make a muthafucka understand BG Bulletwound gets down here
Get throat cut 'round here
And I'm [?] nigga
Ya pussy niggas wanna watch me nigga
Pull out ya stopwatch and clock me nigga (let's get 'em)
And I still do it big, I box these niggas
Gotta put your rags homie, your flags on and stop me nigga
Let's go

[Verse 4: Kutt Calhoun]
Ugh, the smell of murk surrounds you in a city of fast life
And it's trifle and murder tolls shoot up higher than gas prices
A homicide every two or three minutes then a news flash
With cop killers, they ain't carrying books in them school bags
This is full of plotting semantics to use and get used cash
To use against you if you're softer than a baby with a smooth ass
I'm Blood and drew blood with a couple of true thugs
I'm Deuce and it's all it takes when we fading the crew cut

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
From the-from the blocks where we grew up
To the-to the hood that we threw up
You and you and you 'bout to do what?
Running down your lanes with a gang, get a crew cut
Now I know that the Strange got you faded
I know that you saying you're dangerous but save it
We hearing you slanging and banging
Hang with a gang and get a crew cut
Me and my niggas on the same shit

[Verse 5: Tech N9ne]
Check it out, I only got eight bars to do it to it
Hennessy, 151, vodka and gin's my do it fluid
Rocking my red slippers, set trippers I never [?] it
If anytime [?] at your tripping, I never knew it
Lately a lot of niggas really got a lot to say
They flagging it up with red with bandanas on thier head
But back in the day
Repping ricket my niggas was with me and quick to spray
And cross 'em out and put a K we crew cutting fakers on any day

[Verse 6: Krizz Kaliko]
See, I'm a out south nigga, raised up with them white guys
Kaliko, nigga! Yeah, that boy with them white eyes
Might I back down from a confrontation to fight I
But that don't mean that nigga won't get hit with a milimeter and if you really need it you can ask for an ass whooping
'Cause me and the deuces is proof that you're doofuses
Whatever comes to your toofuses mute that shit
All contusions quick [?] beat it
If you stay far away from me I might not need it
Keep it glued shut, lyrically a crew cut

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
From the-from the blocks where we grew up
T the-to the hood that we threw up
You and you and you 'bout to do what?
Running down your lanes with a gang, get a crew cut
Now I know that the Strange got you faded
I know that you saying you're dangerous but save it
We hearing you slanging and banging
Hang with a gang and get a crew cut
Me and my niggas on the same shit

[Outro: Makzilla]
Yeah, after that selection after that song
After that song somebody say, "Hell yeah"
I tell you that Deuce Klik
They gon' ride with somebody tonight, baby
Yo, yeah, they got that Tech N9ne and of course that Kali Baby
Ey, this is the one on the wheels and steels your boy Makzilla here
Ey, you know how we do it here at team Strange
Hey, it's a wild and crazy time
Oh my god, lock your doors, close your windows
And watch your women, baby, 'cause they out there
And niggas beware these niggas is crazy
