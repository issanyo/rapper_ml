(Intro)
To all my strippers around the world (turn this one up y'all)
This yo Kutty buddy (y'all know what time it is)
Bought to you a part by Black Gold (Kutt Calhoun)
So make your money baby, this one's for you (salute)

(Verse 1)
I may not make it rain but love how you wet in the storm
Booty, your legs and your arms
Dancing so sexy you got me (buggin)
You make me want some (lovin')
With your hands all on my dick and VIP we gon' be (lovin')
You keep it up
And I'mma sneak a touch
Your Cuddy gon' squeeze your butt
Plus my cousin he's the bounce he ain't gon speak or nothing
Babe I ain't in love with you per say , I'm in love with your hustling
They way you tend to break these niggas with art of seduction
That's cudos, get your money bitch 2 4's
365 used used drop 100 now you push your legs cucudo
Niggas used to play Tracy but now y'all rocking new clothes
Louie V's, Gucci that, this what you tell them new hoes

(Hook)
Turn it up if you know how to work that pole
Know how to drop it low, slide it down touch the floor
Pick them one's up, watch 'em hit the ground
Don't be ashamed just play loud and say
This right here's your anthem
This right here's your anthem
This right here's your anthem
Go and pick them ones up
This right here's your anthem
This your fucking anthem
This right here's your anthem
This your fucking anthem

(Verse 2)
I love a go getter who's good with the pole tricks and
Body is so thick that you dying to go tip her
Lie on the floor and do this bliss y'all rating those big ol G's
Got every other rookie dancer looking so bitter
They call her Diamond she the kind to get that old nigga
Tricking off that mortgage money in the back of long wigger
But I ain't mad girl, go and get your cash girl
Shake just what your mama gave to you to make a fast buck
She presidential, Michelle Obama
The kind I'm into , my baby mama
No crazy drama just know how to make you want her
And in return I just tell the Dj to turn this song on

(Hook)

(Verse 3)
To every woman stripping do just what you do
Break these niggas get that paper baby do the fucking fool
If ain't nobody told you I'mma tell you, you the fucking truth
A man's world but with a woman's touch all of us salute
So this right here your anthem, you feel it throw your hands up
From the east coast to the west coast and everywhere where dancer
If anybody knocking and questioning what you do
Tell him y'all up in here tipping and stripping you should do this

(Hook)
