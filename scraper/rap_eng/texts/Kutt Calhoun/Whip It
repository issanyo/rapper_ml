F- F- F- Feature Presentation
Hahaha, Tech N9ne, baby! And this one is dedicated to all the ghettos across America! Kutt Calhoun, I mean the nigga hood baby, check it out, 'cause nigga's just so- just so- AAAH!

Kutty Cal, baby
We whip it, whip it, we whip it, whip it, we whip it, whip real good
Strange Music, nigga
We whip it, whip it, we whip it, whip it, we whip it, whip real good
Ay, turn the bass up, man, yeah

[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
So
I'm fresh up out the store
Straight to the liquor store
I'm 'bout to go cop me a fifth of B and hit the road
I got that Keyshia Cole
But niggas wanting dro
It'll make your shoulders lean so when you see me nigga, blow
I'm in the Chevy the same color as Coca Leaf
Caramel guts, 26 Arm-All'd up when they notice me
I know these streets; scenic routes, in and outs where them rollers be
Make the change, top of the game, right where they poda be
Elly-Wellys? We call them lovies; that's when you soak a tree
And get to scootin' and smoke panoramic moment that's so 3D
I hold the key; just like a mayor for what you want and need
So yuck at me and I'm mayor just like a [?]
But fuck with me and you can be missin' just like a suckers free
Is such an ease sucker free niggas don't really fuck with these
But the D they taking over, over your much achieved
Hushing me sort of like Trent Green where Russians be
So you know I'm

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Kutt Calhoun]
I steps like a real should
Paper but still hood, we whip it real good
Aye, we makin' your bitches feel good
Yanked it and still could, we whip it real good
Kutty Cal baby
I steps like a real should
Paper but still hood, we whip it real good
Aye, we makin' your bitches feel good
Yanked it and still could, we whip it real good

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I'm from the city where the bullets go zang if you let them go
And we don't talk if niggas go bang it's a yes or no
And blue and red colored flags hang just to let you know
I tell you it's a pretty big thang if you reppin' MO
And niggas speak a slightly different slang if you peep the code
What it do and what is it be the same, just as what you know
But I can hip you niggas to some cane that'll leave your nose bleeding
Leakin' that vintage from your brain if you bring the dough
I'm part animal and part Confucius
Part Achilles, part Zeus, but my heart's with Deuces
Runnin' wild through the inner-city, marked a nuisance
Chop L's and Israelis haunts the new kids
Who don't have no idea how to cock and shoot shit
Just shootin' hot ones zeppo through the ghetto's acoustics
Like Lucas, stacy niggas gon' dash for music
I'm proven, got the game on grab like nooses
Blown fuses, whenever

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Kutt Calhoun]
I steps like a real should
Paper but still hood, we whip it real good
Aye, we makin' your bitches feel good
Yanked it and still could, we whip it real good
Kutty Cal baby
I steps like a real should
Paper but still hood, we whip it real good
Aye, we makin' your bitches feel good
Yanked it and still could, we whip it real good

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
Alligator Nikes, shadow shaded lights
I'm speeding like Ricky Bobby through the Talladega Night
Club jumping, I'm watching the sun dump from day into the night
I'm wondering, got to do something, it's playa-playa night
In Freaky's I'm V.I. to P. and playas lay it right
Big Nicolas at the front door and he says it's hater-tight
Decisions make right these bitches shade light
J-Lo and Mary J. up in this with stripper jay tights
Christie tastes white, it's Asti to Spumante and a Crystal Bud Light
Still live the thug life, I got a bud right-
In front of me and I'm pondering on what the bud's like
It's taunting me and been summonin'
I'm 'bout to make a move, yo baby what your name is?
She all ready too, 'cause her eyes is telling the truth
I gotsta keep it real hood, make it feel good
And when I whip it nigga, whip it, whip it real good
'Cause you know
