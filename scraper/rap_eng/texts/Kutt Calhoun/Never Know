[Intro: Kutt Calhoun]
2K16, haha
You niggas thought I was dead or something?
Well I brought somebody with me nigga, 'cause you never know when you 'gon need an automatic with ya
There's a lot of people out there who wish for your failure, wish for your demise
I'm here to let you niggas know though

[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
You niggas look surprised to see me, like I no longer exist or mysteriously missing
I'm very much alive and breathing, live in the flesh and whether beyond your premonition
Wish for the rain you gotta deal with the mud, my adversaries all prayed that I would never emerge from it
Much rather see me on my last leg, kick it with no lifeline, stranded all alone for a lifetime
But I'm back reincarnated, witness the prodigy that y'all made, left behind the ball-and-chain, went through all the pain I still managed to forgive niggas am I wrong for saying it?
Black Gold, ain't no limit on the facts known
You hate a nigga with backbone
But rather have a spine that's weak-minded, puppet the string up, don't wanna see the dude get his G's up for real
So I up and took forth a stand and set to motion a plan of never having to feed off a man
No repping for him to get me to prosper in the presence of my enemies, screaming Allahu Akbar
As you proceed with the hatred, Iâ€™ma eat it up and take a great shit squatting on the heads of foes, being blessed I choose, the best payback was turn it into greatness you never know

[Hook: J-Moe]
Well you can say what you wanna say
And you can do what you wanna do
Spark and smoke on the herb all day
Tell 'em my mon, say them boy don't play, nah
We no deal with them haters, bad biters or them fake liars, nah! Disrespect and then fight us
Mad at me 'cause you living ain't right, ya
Smoke, bark up 'cause we don't know ya
Don't care what you think, see I done told ya
Can't trust not a single word that comes from ya
New cowboys, 'cause we [?] come for ya
See ya never know, close eye on your friends and foes
Suffer tread light, it's a heavy load
Ooh! You never know, you never know

[Verse 2: Automatic]
Say what you will, but you can not do this you say that you will
Nah that's some BS, cause we be in the back sipping yak that's the VS
OP, why the hell you mad, 'cause ya bitch chose me?
Homie you better get a grip, instead of tripping on somebody doing better shit
Hate the game, not somebody doing his thing to make a name
Outer lane, that's where I'mma be when I'm moving to make a change
How you gonna beg for it? When you ain't never broke a leg for it
Keep your pussy automatic never paid for it
And I ain't gonna start soon, got you swimming with the sharks with no harpoon
I'm the killa, mothafuckin' gorilla, threaten me, thrilla in Manila
Homie with the fo filla fill ya with some cold bullets even if you play ya cards right we gon' pull up
You think you 5 G's? You ain't shit to me, you gon' take the life of me and my whole family?
You threatening me now that I'm reaching my goals, thinking you gon' get me but you won't

[Hook: J-Moe]
Well you can say what you wanna say
And you can do what you wanna do
Spark and smoke on the herb all day
Tell 'em my mon, say them boy don't play, nah
We no deal with them haters, bad biters or them fake liars, nah! Disrespect and then fight us
Mad at me 'cause you living ain't right, ya
Smoke, bark up 'cause we don't know ya
Don't care what you think, see I done told ya
Can't trust not a single word that comes from ya
New cowboys, 'cause we [?] come for ya
See ya never know, close eye on your friends and foes
Suffer tread light, it's a heavy load
Ooh! You never know, you never know
