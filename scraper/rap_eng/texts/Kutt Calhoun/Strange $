[Intro]
Have you heard about that nigga Kutt Calhoun?
Naw who's that?
I heard that nigga is broke and everything
What?
I heard Tech won't even fuck with him
Ask my own daughter, she'll tell ya
Soo, that's my own daddy and I heard the nigga was goin' bad
Is he?

[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
Damn, is this what happens
When a nigga take a little rest from the scenery?
Can't I enjoy my wealth
Without a motherfucker sayin' they ain't seein' me?
Kutt then just about fell off, huh?
Fell off? Man let me tell y'all somethin'
I put the S in this bitch, the best in this bitch
For game and I'm gon sell y'all some
Breaded up like a Hostess truck
The total opposite of broke as fuck
Tryin' to find a way I can spend it each day
Without haters noticin'
Made enough to loan Oprah some (hell nah)
But it's beaucoup funds
Jessica Simpson's how my money is listed
And that's stupid dumb
Nicki Minaj booty, now you know where I hide cash
It keep gettin' bigger and bigger
That's 'cause I'm an asset to her fine ass
Where her ass is you can find cash
Hit the jackpot, if you find that
But her shit is equipped with explosives
If you even thinkin' of gettin' behind that

[Hook: Kutt Calhoun]
Damn honey, you didn't know I was the man honey?
Y'all thought I was fallin' off
But I snapped back with that Strange money (snapped)
Snapped back with that Strange money (snapped)
Snapped back with that Strange money
Prayin' that I wouldn't bounce back
Man, that shit's startin' to sound strange, money (strange, money)

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Yeah
Lil Wayne told me just do you, that was too true
Bought a Range Rover not a new new but it was booboo
Since I came over to the new school I'm the who's who
To every one who thought I couldn't make it "I'm the true proof"
Stayin' up on my toes, like a midget peein' at a urinal
But back when I sold dope, I envisioned people at my funeral
Found out that I had flows, then I started livin' at the studio
And that was all that she wrote, now my livin' room is so beautiful
'Cause I bang like a Crip and Blood at 85 on Sherm Street
Strange, got my business up, now we finna cut through this lane quick
Damn, once I'm finished up won't be no room for this lame shit
So let me clear the heads of all you squares who on the same kit

[Hook: Kutt Calhoun]
Damn honey, you didn't know I was the man honey?
Y'all thought I was fallin' off
But I snapped back with that Strange money (snapped)
Snapped back with that Strange money (snapped)
Snapped back with that Strange money
Prayin' that I wouldn't bounce back
Man, that shit's startin' to sound strange, money

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
Now okay
Speakin' of snapbacks
Y'all ragged raps need a bottle of that
A perm or somethin' to smoothen it out
Hell a high comb (pass a lather of that)
'Cause y'all lookin' flaky
My grandma can rap better than that
Touch y'all up with a Wag Newport
But it won't take it, still nappy and wack
Kinky, with these rinky-dinky
"Look my pants can't fit me" rhymes
Grown man with a pussy print
Ashamed to even be in these times
Hair shaved, hair long, crazy designs, y'all soft as ever
Add all those up together
Man y'all niggas lookin' like Salt-N-Pepa
But I won't fuck you
It's a damn shame what a buck do
So if rich and famous meant bein' like that
Then you can catch ya boy on the bus fool
Holdin' on to my transfer, old, gray, wrinkled, with a buck tooth
Tellin' stories 'bout how I never sold my soul 'cause I'm fuck proof

[Hook: Kutt Calhoun]
Damn honey, you didn't know I was the man honey?
Y'all thought I was fallin' off
But I snapped back with that Strange money (snapped)
Snapped back with that Strange money (snapped)
Snapped back with that Strange money
Prayin' that I wouldn't bounce back
Man, that shit's startin' to sound strange, money (strange, money)

[Outro]
Daddy, I'm sorry, I was just playin'
Can you grab me some honest behavior tickets, please?
Yeah, I sure will
Soon as you get your ass in there and brush them damn teeth
Noo
