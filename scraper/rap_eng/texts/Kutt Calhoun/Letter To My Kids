(Intro)
Its like am I, am I doing this for a reason
I don't know, I don't understand sometimes so
I know its harder for y'all to understand so Imma sit down and write this letter to you
Let all of y'all know how it feels for daddy

(Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun)
There ain't no words to express the way that I feel
But hopefully this song can connect you to what is real
The life that I live is so demanding with trying to rock the planet
And I just hope my babies understand it
I'm knowing while I'm gone you're steady getting older and older
I know this walking with this bird under my shoulder
So Malik and Andrea, Unique, Dari and Darius
And O'Shea, never had a clue on y'all could prepare for this
If I could just vent for a moment, please understand it
Daddy's intentions was having your best at interests when no one else mattered
Bringing my kids into the world is a blessing to me
With 4 boys and 2 beautiful little girls
I cling onto all of our memories and the pictures you give to me
Help me remember what I'm never here to see
So please keep your mind I'd be dreaming about you
Until the next time I see you, continued on Page 2

(Chorus: Krizz Kaliko)
So I'm sitting down and write to you
Hope this letter gets you through
I can't see what you can see when you're crying
And so another birthday passes through
Daddy can't make it home to you
So know inside my heart I'm slowly dying

(Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun)
Andrea, when you moved out to Charlotte, a part of your daddy died
Had to tell you goodbye, and I can see it in your eyes
So I tried to be strong and tell you everything was fine
But had to turn away quick cause I was crying
That's why I don't understand why your mama moved you away from me till this day
So I plan to be stable so you can stay with me
Cause all the pain and problems that life is lived as you fight em
And the win and I hope your mama realize (Come on back T)
Shea, if you reading this letter, wish you was here today
But everything up the road in St.Joe is in disarray
And that's no excuse when when me and your mama produced you
Didn't ask to be here so why are we both acting stupid
You're an honor roll student and got a future in sports
So you deserve that I give 100 percent of support
Me being gone doesn't make it better I know that you missing me
Miss you too and I promise it'll get better I swear it, you'll see

(Chorus)
So I'm sitting down and write to you
Hope this letter gets you through
I can't see what you can see when you're crying
And so another birthday passes through
Daddy can't make it home to you
So know inside my heart I'm slowly dying

(Verse 3)
Darius, damn my little banner of glamor
It's been a couple of years so tell me, how was Atlanta?
I see you talk with Atwain now, but that doesn't change how
You wish to be here with your daddy, gritting the same route
Came back for the summer I can't begin to explain how
My heart skipped a couple of beats when we got to hang out
We picked up your brother Malik ,the oldest, he's thirteen
Had a ball, we was cracking up at the table at Applebees
You still got a bro and sis you ain't met Darioni, Unique
Dari is 9 and Unique is 10 and you all need to meet
The sooner the better because y'all growing so fast
We need to all get together, try and catch up on our past
And keep in touch for the future between you brothers and sisters
But I give props to your mothers for raising you and the troopers
Do anything in this world for you
I'll show you what Imma do
And Deana remember that I love you
And your mama too (So let me see my kids)

(Chorus)
So I'm sitting down and write to you
Hope this letter gets you through
I can't see what you can see when you're crying
And so another birthday passes through
Daddy can't make it home to you
So know inside my heart I'm slowly dying
