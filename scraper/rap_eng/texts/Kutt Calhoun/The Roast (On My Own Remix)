(HOOK)
I'm on my own now, oh
Picking up the pieces, I did it for a reason
I'm on my own now, oh
It's for the people, I got them fiending
I got what you want
Yea I got you, I got you, I got you
I got what you want
Yea I got you, I got you, I got you

[Verse 1]
For a little bit, I was trying to impress
Everything I did, left me in distress
Felt like I wasn’t good enough, like dirt
Couldn’t even escape, even the mic hurt
So I, ran away. Never to be seen again
All I took was a paper and pen
Maybe if I tried to return
I’d feel some time of a burn
And I’d drop the pain from within
So I did it was my Wish
That you didn’t see it as a diss
But then you tryna start shit
Talk about me to all your friends
But your attitude is trash
Why I left you in the past
I’m moving on I came to term’s
Cuz I knew it wasn’t gone last
But it was never my plan
I never demanded anything like this
Thought it would be a simple friendship
Now I understand what I did when I sent this
Sounding like a man
Kinda looking like one too
Anybody going for you, that’s a dumb move
Maybe I should tell em you a Psycho Bitch
Maybe I should tell em you self-indulgent
Cuz you thought that I was obsessed
I would have loved you til my death
But it’s the opposite, thought we were just friends
Now there’s nothing left
Say your attitude is trash
Why I left you in the past
I’m moving on I came to term’s
Maybe my heart is with latch

(HOOK)
I'm on my own now, oh
Picking up the pieces, I did it for a reason
I'm on my own now, oh
It's for the people, I got them fiending
I got what you want
Yea I got you, I got you, I got you
I got what you want
Yea I got you, I got you, I got you

[Verse 2]
I reached out to a rapper in my area
Thinking they could bring heat
But really they just procrastinated
And the hate is all on me
It’s not my fault you can’t keep up
Not my fault you can’t see
I’m the best around tryna test me now
I remind you it’s X-E-C bitch please
When I came in the game with that straight fire
You can see that I ain’t lying
Building block first testament
You can see that I’m aiming high and
I will not be stopped til I reach the pinnacle
Already there in skill
I beat around the bush with Slow Down
Now I’m going for the kill
ILL
Everybody told me how good you were
Off the top, and written
Sure you were good with somebody else’s words
You can stop with those gimmicks
You not what Hip-Hop is
You lyrical midget
I write pain like Mike J
At least he could write his lyrics
If somebody asks you what’s raw
You tell them “My flows is”
Cuz really you a joke
Me and your girl got matching noses
THUNDER THIGHS down the hallway, you think I wouldn’t notice?
Like Westbrook, when she steps look!
But who’s 0 I’m the closest 1

(HOOK)
I'm on my own now, oh
Picking up the pieces, I did it for a reason
I'm on my own now, oh
It's for the people, I got them fiending
I got what you want
Yea I got you, I got you, I got you
I got what you want
Yea I got you, I got you, I got you

[Verse 3]
From this point on
Everybody fuck off
Come down my road and you will get cut off
Fed up with this Earth’s shit
No I don’t deserve it
Crown me king cuz I’ve earned it
You scumbags is worthless
Fuck him and fuck her and fuck you if you hurt this
So curve it
Uh
I openly talked about how much I valued our friendship
I’m sorry for hurting you it was never my intention
I was ready to move on, and so you were
For some reason it was to a douche
People I ask why I have trust issues?
It is because you don’t cherish your values
Christian that’s bogus
And I know it
You slept with a fuckboy
Then you wanna choose a motherfucker on his morals?
That’s bogus and you know it
Why you gotta be like that?
The songs I wrote were golden
Put too much effort in something that was
Clearly already broken
FUCK
Oh my god
X how you spit it like it’s your job
I gotta anger problem
Lashing out on bitches that ain’t worth the watch or wallet
I want to apologize though I would be dishonest
I got one thing in this world Free Nature, alone as promised

(HOOK)

[Outro]
Cuz I’m alone and you want it
Free Nature I’mma run it
I blame you most definite
Free Nature I’m repping it
