[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
My life in a nutshell contains some things
You wouldn't want to make public, too ashamed to sang
I got a pack of Black & Milds and a gang of change
And crown royal bag put a away for a rainy day
I know it's hard to accept this barcode [?]
Born too eclectic, y'all narcoleptic
Niggas better ([?]) go to your local gambling stock
And try to raise the stakes on Kutt
Because (why?)

[Krizz Kaliko]
He came to turn the world out (Kutt)
Since then, now what you know 'bout?

[Kutt Calhoun]
Loosen your mind up, just to remind that
Kansas City, Missouri's now a loop in a line-up
[?] see the snake and a bat
You can mistake it for rap supervillain without the cape and a hat
Screamin' "Nnutthowze, six, six, triple-eight, four, six nine, nine three bombin' with a warning"

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Please, watch out for that nigga there
He's not your average, he's somethin' like a playa
Round up your cavalries and bust 'til nothing's there
[?] all the smoke is clear, it's that nigga there

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Listen up, I'm about to get dope









[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Please, watch out for that nigga there
He's not your average, he's somethin' like a playa
Round up your cavalries and bust 'til nothing's there
[?] all the smoke is clear, it's that nigga there

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
Last verse is purposely wrote for you to quote








[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Please, watch out for that nigga there
He's not your average, he's somethin' like a playa
Round up your cavalries and bust 'til nothing's there
[?] all the smoke is clear, it's that nigga there
Please, watch out for that nigga there
He's not your average, he's somethin' like a playa
Round up your cavalries and bust 'til nothing's there
[?] all the smoke is clear, it's that nigga there
