[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
There’s ten rules to the game, what I share at you two, no?
Niggas gonna hate you for whatever you do
That some of the realest shit I ever heard, valid and true
I took the toll [?] street, Balance was proof
Niggas don’t want to see you make it
They rather see you scrambling
Break fast apart so they can come and eat your bacon
I see it way to often, often murder is the cake behind it
Starving pack of hyenas, holy for the safe
Weather rapping or you trapping it dont matter its the flame
[?]
That you winning now you got to watch the slither of a snake
Cause the venom is intended to break into your fate
But I’m looking at these pussies like a Tendon ‘round a steak
East these niggas up for dinner
Once I’m finished with the plate
Imma go and take a shit before I flush it down and paint at you a picture in this [?] art of envy, understand

[Hook: Codak Carter]
[?]

[Verse 2: Vi Royal]
I’m so motherfucking close that I can taste it
Hungry young gunner while i feed off of hatred
Feeling like a fiend to this dream that I’m chasing
Been years in the making
I ain’t ‘bout to let em come take it
Now a nigga coming up, all they do is envy
But everything was cool when my pockets all empty
Back when i was hella broke, didn’t have a penny
They were tryna stunt on me now they want to stunt with me
They dont wanna roll in, but they want a ride now
Use to have a blue buzz I’m guessing that it died down
Hustle while you lie round, cozy in a nightgown
Swear there’s some hatin ass niggas up in my town
Nope I ain’t letting up, go and light my pedals up
You don’t want to lose the best thing you do is bet on us
For the fact Strange Music, B.Hood etcetera
High for that envy I ain’t familiar with that area
(Tell em [?])

[Verse 3: JL. of B. Hood]
They carry a evil grin, disgusted when you win
Devious deep within [?] my freedom
Like what you doing is hurting their chances of succeeding
[?] They pull at you they shoot bullets at you for eating
And it get messy now, recipe for death if you mess around
No referee preferably at your neck when there's death around
See a nigga might be needed, they stressed out wound up
When you get crowned, coming from ground-up
It’s bound to happen multiple [?] clapping
The crowd reaction the others that hate attacking
Try knocking over [?]
The clock will never turn back and you never can tell the future
Wicked intentions to twist your positions no Karma Sutra
They just want attention, wanna be mentioned, stuck in one dimension
Sucks so they dissin’ fuck cause its [?] that they missing
Too busy being a hindrance and hating with every sentence
And eliminating the demons make lemonade out of lemons
