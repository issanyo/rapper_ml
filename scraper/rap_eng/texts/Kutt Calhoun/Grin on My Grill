[Intro: Greed]
When you see me smiling
Just know that that's a frown turned upside down
So that grin on my face
That's a plot to come knock your chin outta place

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I got a grin on my grill
I grab the mic and stay real
We can't be beat
We can't be stopped
We will not fall

[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
A nigga is like, move blood
Dude starring at me like he know me with a grin on my grill
I simply reply "Dude what? Ain't your name Kutt?"
Look y'all it's the B.L.E.V.E. man himself
Anyway, I don't want no problems all I'm trying to do is kick it with some bitches make my way to V.I.P
And dude is like cool if I get you and your crew all through that's for you tell me what's in it for me
Uhhh, we can make it happen since I am a known rapper rock the mic with no fever understand
I keep a burn burn thicky thicky thang thang on if anybody run up a chicky bang bang
Gonna everybody is grooving and sweating nude in the flesh real sex like the film on the real
And that's me Tech N9ne, Kutt Calhoun and my man X left with a grin our grill, for real

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Grinning on you motherfuckers
Simply cause your bitches love us
Crunk up in the club they pump us
If they tripping got them dumpers
Eeny meeny miny hoe
We get them bitches back to the MO and then we (Uhhh!)
Tear the pussy down yo
X-Dash, sex cash, gets ass, wet splash, let's smash, that's bad
No it ain't, breast blast, Tech's had, flesh flash
Rolling with X, Krizz and Kutty with a grin on my grill
Look a my contract ain't nothing but sin on my deal
Been on my meal-ticket chase I been all my bills
Calling my publishing company like when I'm on my skrill
One of the, fathers of rap, hard as a gat
Rolling with mexicans who ride in the car with a bat
Got you stuck off in the middle trick
You can tell that she cheating on you by the red dot on your pillow bitch!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]

[Verse 3: X-Dash]
I'm a lock and load soldier, rock and roll culture
Strange representitive optical scorcher
Photo fies phenomenon optical torture
Full equipped and got a pump like the black vulture
You can say that Kansas City won't shine
And that we never gonna make it that we wasting our time
Your girlfriends bumping us your tasting our rhymes
You biting your tounge off and standing in line to buy tickets to the next show
X rolls, X knows Tech and Kutt so let's go
Venta aqui mammi, I wreck homes
Sending you the videotape of her dome
Grin on my grill, hand on my cock I haven't even sold a unit and you run on my jock
Now that I'm giving you my music it's a matter clock
Tick tock, tick tock

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]

[Outro: Greed]
Yo we can't be beat, touched or stopped
This is Greed, another devious seed
Keep it keeblur
