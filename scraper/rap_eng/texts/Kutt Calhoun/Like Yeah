[Intro]
(TECH N9NE!) Technicians!
Ahoo! Ahoo! Ahoo!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Ey! It's time to get into some sin you been listenin' to jibberish
Hits in the interim, them are done 'cause here me come
(To make you stand up, stand tough, hands up, damn ya)
If you don't get it, get rid of it, trip if you diggin' it!
I guess I got mo' than my balls and my word
I got broads in a herd, chasin' this and all of my nerves
(They've got the illness, they feel this realness, chill, bitch)
I got a bed, it's too crowded for you to come get in it!
I spit that Tech schei√üe off to y'all
It's crazy! Even Michael Jackson said it's "Off the Wall"
(I'm with the sickness, big Tech's lidless, Midwest)
I be the best one for gunnin', nobody can get with it!
So when you see me in the spot: bow down, trick
I eat, drink, sleep, dress, look and sound rich
(So jump up, get pumped up, crunked up, everyone must)
Stop with the jealousy with me, the haters be riveted!

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
(K-I-L-L) E to the R, a dot!
Just ain't fair that when I pop up the spot be like, "YEAH!"
Killer, killer, it's the gorilla
And if they feel ya they screamin' like
"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
Like, "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
Mister, mister, quick to get with ya
Chick, if she get a whiff of this she'll be like
"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
Like, "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I'm back with the heat and yes, Young Fyre produced it
With true spit, I get lots of relish with Strange Music
My crew's thick, (That's right!) Deuce Clique, and guess who's with
Two chicks (Tech N9ne!) In my lou of Caribou sips
The super dew lifts, everybody in the party will lose it
Vodka and Mountain Dew is the new shit
Thanks to IcyRoc and Demonica, we honor ya
And I get so much money sometimes it feel like I'm wearin' a yarmulke
You cannot monitor my money, I'll monetarily astonish ya
So what's with the bad comments and all the drama for?
(I can produce a picture, stop with the truce and hit ya
I'm at the top, but I can be poppin' and shootin' with ya)
Chip on my shoulder now, "Mr. Nice Guy" is over, wow!
To a ritzy and older style from ditsy and Gomer Pyle
Look at my checks swell, chicks with wet tails
Ready to rock it, in my pocket got the Trojan Magnum XL's

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
(K-I-L-L) E to the R, a dot!
Just ain't fair that when I pop up the spot be like, "YEAH!"
Killer, killer, it's the gorilla
And if they feel ya they screamin' like
"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
Like, "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
Mister, mister, quick to get with ya
Chick, if she get a whiff of this she'll be like
"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
Like, "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
(TECH N9NE!) Yeah, I think they with me, mayne
Yeah, yeah, this is Kansas City, mayne
The industry's still punks, that's why they real slump
But when we in this drop, all our records we will dump
Havin' a good time, just stackin' 'em with Travis, we laid back
Doin' about a hundred fifty with slaps in the Maybach
Haters, of course ya doubt that I'm makin' a warped amount
I got Ozone, Murder Dog, double XL and Source accounts
(So what's all the force about?) Killer in and remorse is out!
Fuck Mark Cerami, you heard that from the horse's mouth
That ain't comin' from RBC, that ain't comin' from Fontana
It's comin' from Strange Music's Dontana in a calm manner
I'll say this in baritone, ("We come to get our cheddar!")
Huntin' you in yo' dreams, you wake up screamin' in falsetto
MTV clipped me, birthday bash show
I got fans like cat castro that'll boost my cash flow!
MTV, completely, we sick of it, you won't give a bit?
Just look at my eyes and my blood and my ligaments
You can see that Tecca Nina don't give a shit

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
(K-I-L-L) E to the R, a dot!
Just ain't fair that when I pop up the spot be like, "YEAH!"
Killer, killer, it's the gorilla
And if they feel ya they screamin' like
"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
Like, "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
Mister, mister, quick to get with ya
Chick, if she get a whiff of this she'll be like
"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
Like, "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
