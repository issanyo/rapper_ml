[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
You and your girls, me and my guys
Can all connect and have a real good time
It ain't your duty, girl go get your booty
Let's get somewhere and let the night unwind

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
She'll do
And a funny looking friend that's with her
But her too
The liquor got me saying whatever
I want to
She on me like a brand new sweater
But I'm cool, mama I want you

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
So now I step into the party, sipping on liquor
Looking for a prize, right lines to deliver
So she can take me home, let me dip off in her liver
Make her say *dolphin noise* like flipper
But she had a big girl with her and hatin' one, boo
Give me the friend, I'mma take the fat one too
Set it out like make it right for your due
Dip her booty like bubblegum already been chewed
Head full of weed and a bad attitude
Mouth full of dough and a plate full of food
Wait for her to move 'cause I'm casing the place
Off of Caribou Lou so I can't see her face
But we off to, you ain't scared to go, is ya?
I want you, it ain't fair if I kiss ya
I'm on you, get her home and do the grown up
She wasn't quite as pretty when I woke up
But she'll do

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
She'll do
And a funny looking friend that's with her
But her too
The liquor got me saying whatever
I want to
She on me like a brand new sweater
But I'm cool, mama I want you

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
And this is for everybody
'Specially the ugly people that's at the party
I see all you big girls looking at me
You got the muchies well I'm your Laffy Taffy
Girl get at me

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Now if I can't get her I'll settle for you girl
Looking right from behind, turn around I'm like oooh girl
Looking like Pep√© Le Pew's girl, it just won't pass
I'm stunned, you cute girls
If I have one more drink it really ain't gon' matter what my homeboys think beside you gotta think outside the box
At times you find a broad that's not as finest as you had in mind
So stop being picky, picky, picky
Little liquorice sticky icky, get you licky, licky
I'm debating a connoisseur in a fishy city
Drill her in and I'll still do her if she iffy, iffy
Damn straigh, 'cause when the lights go out
And that thang gon' rock
Then you'll understand what I'm talking about
If you thin, tall or short or even big as a shark
Everybody looks good in the dark, don't you agree?

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
She'll do
And a funny looking friend that's with her
But her too
The liquor got me saying whatever
I want to
She on me like a brand new sweater
But I'm cool, mama I want you

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
And this is for everybody
'Specially the ugly people that's at the party
I see all you big girls looking at me
You got the muchies well I'm your Laffy Taffy
Girl get at me

[Verse 3: DJ Chill]
Ayo, I don't mean to [?], I take by twos man
I keeps it on the under, these is late night moves (oh, wow)
Now usually I take some slender
But she was hella blunt with a fat-ass bender
A classic case of eyes  bigger than my stomach
I hope that homies don't find out, I can't believe I've done it
All I know is I was on the floor doin' my thing, man
But somehow and somewhere I fucked around, I can't lean man
I got drugged and off morning I get you
She was bigger than Tim and Dave and looking hella huge
But I ain't no punk homie, I slap that ass
Smelling like wheel diggers, I tap that ass
If my girl only knew, she weighs [?] compared to the broad I screw
But understanding ain't a tits or a tan
She bites chicken and puts chips on my hand
So-a so

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
She'll do
And a funny looking friend that's with her
But her too
The liquor got me saying whatever
I want to
She on me like a brand new sweater
But I'm cool, mama I want you

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
And this is for everybody
'Specially the ugly people that's at the party
I see all you big girls looking at me
You got the muchies well I'm your Laffy Taffy
Girl get at me
