[Intro]
Choppers!
Oooh-wee
Oooh-wee baby, baby
I like it a lot

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm talkin' 'bout ghetto love
Girl don't keep me waitin' for that
Ghetto love
Talk 'bout misbehavin' 'cause when I
Get you home in the sack and when I give it to you
Give it back, give it back, give it back, give it back, give it back
I'm talkin' 'bout ghetto love
Girl don't keep me waitin' for that
Ghetto love
Talk 'bout misbehavin' 'cause when I
Get you home in the sack and when I give it to you
Give it back, give it back, give it back, give it back, naked ass

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm talkin' 'bout socks on, socks off, get my rocks off
Big old back end, wax on, wax off
You can have it however you like, thin or go bad
Makin' sure the cookie monster is tight
Ginseng make ya swing from the chandelier
I know I sing but this a real man standin' here
Now that I think cackle
Lay on your back girl, I'll have you thinkin' I'm the king of the world!
When I put my thing in ya girl!
I'm pullin' micro-braids and weaves out, blowin' backs and knees out
Have ya screamin' Kali baby after that I ease out
A predator lookin' for a black and decker pecker wrecker
With better than bed and head and make me wish I never left her
Hey! Hey! Don't tell your girlfriend how I beat it up
And your man, he so cold to ya and I heat it up
Let go your inhibitions, reservations: swallow them
Get some ghetto-ness, I give it to you at your mama-nems

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Talkin' 'bout ghetto love
Girl don't keep me waitin' for that
Ghetto love
Talk 'bout misbehavin' 'cause when I
Get you home in the sack and when I give it to you
Give it back, give it back, give it back, give it back, give it back
I'm talkin' 'bout ghetto love
Girl don't keep me waitin' for that
Ghetto love!
Talk 'bout misbehavin' 'cause when I
Get you home in the sack and when I give it to you
Give it back, give it back, give it back, give it back, naked ass

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Have you ever all witnessed the "just been hit with a dick" stature?
From a nigga like me who licks it then hits in it after
All in your cervix servin' you some of this summer salami
Work up a sweat from passionate sex like performing pilates
Ghetto! I'm lex-er than steel when it comes to real sex in the pill
(Precaution) No step in this fill if you scared of catchin' a dilznick
Real spit or do you prefer lil' dick?
She said "no I likes it nice and hard to bring the real shit"
And I'll be comin', comin' from around a corner
With a box of Magnums to put it on you
Backpack and Newports, a fifth of Patr√≥n you
Never hear Kutt Calhoun's a loner
I'm not sincere, not me from the bottom of a bad
Motherfucker named Sascha Fierce
Drink, drink your Kool-Aid with a booty naked
Ain't nothin' but some motherfuckin' sex in here
I beat the koochie, I treat the koochie
I never heard a bitch call me a pussy
(Why?) ain't seducing shut 'em up quick
Make 'em cover up dick like she's a coozie
Tell 'em Kutt just what you like little mommy and we can settle up
We'll have you twitchin', feindin'
And constantly thinkin' 'bout my ghe-'bout-'bout my

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Ghetto love
Girl don't keep me waitin' for that
Get some love
Talk 'bout misbehavin' 'cause when I
Get you home in the sack and when I give it to you
Give it back, give it back, give it back, give it back, give it back
I'm talkin' 'bout ghetto love
Girl don't keep me waitin' for that
Get some love
Talk 'bout misbehavin' 'cause when I
Get you home in the sack and when I give it to you
Give it back, give it back, give it back, give it back, naked ass

[Brige: Tech N9ne]
I want you to pop it and dip
Then upswing your hips
Back it up and don't trip
Let your back bone slip
Spin around, get a grip
Of the pole and then flip
Baby thats the way you strip
Here's your tip, not on the lips

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Hey-hey the ghetto be missin' me, I had an epiphany
I need some ghetto lovin', so I get where they're diggin' me
They sniffin' and kissin' me
Wanna split with me? All in favor say ye
Is you is or is you ain't my constituency?
Whooo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!
Heimlich, all over Tech N9ne dick, I'm a organ grind this
Do you know you're beautiful and you're fine miss?
And you two, you three finest, will you never be mine, miss?
I love big behinds, call me your highndness
Heavens to Murgatroyd, I love when you're workin'
You're twirkin' that ghetto booty, even makin' suburban boys
Make a lot of suburban noise, got money in my pocket like I'm a turban boy
So after your coochie crusade, you know she ghetto
If she come and bring you Kool-Aid (Oh, yeah)

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Ghetto love
Girl don't keep me waitin' for that
Ghetto love
Talk 'bout misbehavin' 'cause when I
Get you home in the sack and when I give it to you
Give it back, give it back, give it back, give it back, give it back
I'm talkin' 'bout ghetto love
Girl don't keep me waitin' for that
Get some love
Talk 'bout misbehavin' 'cause when I
Get you home in the sack and when I give it to you
Give it back, give it back, give it back, give it back, naked ass

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm talkin about pole slidin', lap dance ridin'
Do something strange for some change if you're buying
But big strippers make big tippers
Show no thankful for all their booty you give us
For just a drink or two, she'll make it wink at you
Drain your change until she think you're through
The ohh she got your booty bopper
Oochie-wobble watch you while she callin' you poppa
The urge to push to thrust, I mean to shove
Takes you back to the ghetto for some ghetto
