[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
Who you be nigga, strange and beligerant
I'm the definition of stupid crazy and iganant
Kutty is always into it, never know when I'm fin to get saucy then get shit bossy
I take the pussy and christen it, pass it to nigga krizz [?] and pretty soon it's beast
Fuckin your main little squeeze, and won't remember it, each moment intimate freaks moaning, I'm innocent
Scream they want it in em. quick please. I won't cum in a bitch
And even white hoes want address a brotha, caress a brotha so we just call them careful lovers
Oh careful brotha, I used to slide out in the day but I ain't tryin to slide it out with some aid
Nigga yous feelz me
I know they want some of that cloudy and naze so I just tell em and around by way it's gonna kill me [x2]

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
If ya trippin I'm a hit'cha, betcha won't hit me back
When I hit'cha with this tech I bet'cha won't hit me back
I know ya hate the way I skeet in the 'lac, three gonn' be in the back with the semi, semi, semi

Soo woo woo Soo woo woo Soo woo
Soo woo woo Soo woo woo Soo woo
(Gonn' be furious when I be checkin you!)
Soo woo woo Soo woo woo Soo woo
Soo woo woo Soo woo woo Soo woo

[Verse2: Tech N9ne]
When I got back with the Villians I got this feelin' of togetherness, no better clique was reppin' than harder than Villian
I talked to Scooby the general, he told me trippin' was minimal because that the hardest in red, I told him fill me in
He told me rock, better yet bob runnin' from Kali from cops to KC and put the red rag and rocks on Scooby'nem
Infected the midwest blocks, that was 85 now I'm locked on 57th n got cowards ready to do me in
I'm 34 now, and still it's war, how? Beacuse I rep 5 6 and 7 for sure pal
And I don't walk with my niggas or talk to my niggas no more, but me and the Villians and Hosses, niggas [?]
I'm lost in riches on tour and I'm off in bitches and whores and I'm tossin' liquors in Florida and niggas in Denver are sore with us
Oh why? Hope the crips and the bloods had niggas die, so how can you look me in the my eye
Like cause be, because I ain't smoked the lovely
And went to the burrial ground and burried niggas who loved me
That's disrespect homie, we got respect only we don't bludgen niggas to death when in you jecks homies
They put they specs on me glancin at my wrist watch
Like I ain't with Deuce n Nick off in this spot
Like I ain't got ties to the 5 6 block, real niggas that'll kill you, listenin' to Slipknot
Got us bustin' out of a red Impalla
Niggas better call Africa Bombata
Or Ja, Yawe, Jesus, then Allah, cause niggas gonn' whip you like a human pi√±ata
[?], I'm a give a nigga necrosses, I'm hopeless when I'm in ya focus just notice my psychosis is the dopest
And I'm about to get my niggas back into rap, with they straps in they lap, 57 with the gat, hit me back!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
If ya trippin I'm a hit'cha, betcha won't hit me back

[Verse3: Kutt Calhoun]
So I get shit back before I hit ya back
When I click and clack nigga if it's this and that
Or a frick and frack
Blood I can get you back

And you can put a bitch on that
I boost the view to prove that you just a batch
Matter fact the dude will boost and [?]
Oops I mean imposter invision that, better let it it ride or you can never hit me back. nigga
