[Intro: Tech N9ne]
God status
Musical, omnipotent

It's time to go, brothers
11 years and we're finally here
Beyond the stars, the trinity
God status, let's go!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]
Who do you believe in?
Is it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?
(Do you believe, believe, believe?)
Do you believe? Do you believe?
Who do you believe in?
Is it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?
(Do you believe, believe, believe)
Do you believe? Do you believe?
Who do you believe in?
Gods!

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Me and Tech and them started on a quest for
M... O-N-E-Y, we touching so many, why?
'Cause we spiritual, feeling every syllable we spit out
We angels, that's the way we telling demons to get out
So bled out, baddest nigga representing the Mi-ddle
Feeling like the world cannot live with-out, Ta-dow!
Now we immortal! Somebody open up the portal!
Rap is [?] when me and Nina was caught on!
We God status, God threw a task at us
Told us he make us angels but our mission's to kill the baddest
So we gotta blast the bastards with our rapping apparatuses
Never let off the ravage on 'em like rabbits on radishes
We're like the Grateful Dead, our fans are the new dead heads
Repeat every word we saying like it's a pled-edge
And when you hear them gods and love how it sounded
When you see the king, kneel to the ground, make a fist and pound it

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]
Who do you believe in?
Is it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?
(Do you believe, believe, believe?)
Do you believe? Do you believe?
Who do you believe in?
Is it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?
(Do you believe, believe, believe)
Do you believe? Do you believe?
Who do you believe in?
Gods!

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I told you I'm forever, didn't I?
The highly exalted the christen (your souls)
Those grounded I aspire to lift 'em up
The holy goes through the frequency of your audio speakers
They're set on all that can reach us, by now we're adios
Witness the blessings, beliefs and hopefulness I bestow
Upon a fan or foe, man or those opposing the Chanet growth
I plant it so everyone on the planet can evoke
The entity sent to be this music industries' manifold
I manifested; it's been suggested that I arose up
From under the sheets of God's baby cradle sent down to pose
A threat to Masonic rappers, protest against moral lackage
Invested in this infested depiction of worldwide gibberish
S-suffer no more here it is, a little experiment with Jesus
Blood and mortal when the spirit mix
Drink it, it's so refreshing - just like the air of my message
The breeze carries and once you inhale it
Then I will ask you

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]
Who do you believe in?
Is it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?
(Do you believe, believe, believe?)
Do you believe? Do you believe?
Who do you believe in?
Is it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?
(Do you believe, believe, believe)
Do you believe? Do you believe?
Who do you believe in?
Gods!

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Exalted, bosses, can't off his office with crosses
That's what he fought within darkness' mosses
No caustic losses 'cause the brain's embossed with the word auspiciousness
Feed my fam flows fluidly, they would never leave my land no truancy
'Cause I am the reason they stand for unity
Unlike me with whackness you give your fans no immunity
I am the air they share, I am the heir to the throne
Where no compare in my own zone, this lair is home grown
It's rare but it's on strong
Beware: long gone if you dare got the wrong tone
Now! We are beyond those who got fame
Gave my heart and many souls were obtained
So my lane will definitely not change
Cause G.O.D.S. means the Great Omnipotent Doc Strange

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]
Who do you believe in?
Is it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?
(Do you believe, believe, believe?)
Do you believe? Do you believe?
Who do you believe in?
Is it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?
(Do you believe, believe, believe)
Do you believe? Do you believe?
Who do you believe in?
Gods!
