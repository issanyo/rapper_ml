What y'all niggas gon' do about Kansas City? Huh?

[Verse 1: BG Bulletwound]
You niggas ain't gangstas, y'all small time in the game

You sell your soul right? Well I'm the type of nigga that'll test you for your car and leave you sleeping in the cold right
This Kansas City homie, known to mob with gangstas, ask Scotty, and Capone and Jesse James and them
And I bet they tell you that Midwest draw down
Bringing the heat to y'all clowns, leaving the streak in y'all

[Verse 2: Greed]
I got that new new killa, [?]
When I spit, I'mma hit shit and them fake niggas gon' die
For ones that [?] for the ride, say they kill but they die
This cat built to the side, his gat pulled to the side
So if you claiming you a gangsta, you better walk that walk
As well as your bitch ass talk that talk
'Cause I'mma give 'em this whoop de whoop, I walk softly
Carry a big staff to back them niggas up off of me, what?
