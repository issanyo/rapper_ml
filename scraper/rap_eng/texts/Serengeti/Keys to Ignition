Ayo Whimsy like smelling like a swimming pool
Or crates of old tennis balls
Or "Best friends forever!" to Christine from Jeneane and Paul
It's gonna be a wonderful summer
To start smoking cigarettes and hooking up with drummers
And lost identity
And starting to get a little thin
New habits seem fun
Until the monkey weighs a ton
Anyway, whimsy like I'm recently divorced
After purchasing my dream Saab
And matching blue Croc clogs

Did or you didn't keep hidden
Keys to ignition deep within you like it's this missing
Or clock ticking that's keeping your living

Tennis lobs on a beautiful clay court
Tight underwear for a little extra schlong support
Like no tour
Are dreamers destined to be poor?
A very creative mind
But sleeping on a cement floor
Loose schedule and always saying how I'm free
No checking account
Hallucinate like 3D
Hi, I'm important I will never be a corporate slave
I'm gonna find my mind in the motherfucking Incan maze
How's that for a great way to bounce back
Disgusting like trying to sleep and hearing the snap of rat traps
Or flying ants or ripping your best breaking pants
Or seeing your dream girl and realizing you haven't any chance
Just a dream like an instant trick rich scheme
Or when the refs not looking the wrestler gets double teamed
No fair like selling a broke frigidare
Or in the hood late night
With dyed neon green hair
What are you looking for?
Nobody really knows
You could be a bumb or a woman with a hundred rolls
Eat cakes
Don't stop eat snakes
Be quiet like the sound of falling dandruff makes
Whimsy like uncontrolled imagination
Never having days off
And always being way off
Blast off, like saying the wrong things on tape
Or haven't been seen for three years and coming back outta shape
With tall tales about Venice and eating steamed snails
Wrongfully jailed for boning neice of the Duke of Wales
Thus the weight gain
Insane in the left membrane
Agatha Christie tales of murders on a fancy train
Not the bus
And going to work in a rush
Walking on egg shells cause the boss doesn't like you much
No stamp like the .anticon black ant
And having bad luck turning seeds to psychoactive plants
Nothing's changed, everything just stayed the same
"Do you feel anything?" "Nope, just lung pains"
Business
It can rule you or you can have none
And on the bus with other Americans that weigh a ton
And fireman come
And cut down walls
And Dr. Phil marches in and gives them all workout balls
And a motivational speech for the ages
Meanwhile enslaved children sleep in cages
And make dresses
Peep the whimsy necklace
I felt kinda outta place when I chilled in Texas

Did or you didn't keep hidden
Keys to ignition deep within you like it's this missing
Or clock ticking that's keeping your living
