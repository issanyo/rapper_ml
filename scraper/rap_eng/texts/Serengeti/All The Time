[Verse 1]
You pinned my arm to the couch
And you're on top of me
I forgot what you looked like
It's a shame
I see you all the time now

You pinned my arm to the couch
And you hugged, and hugged, and hugged
And squeezed (x8)
And then you looked down at me confused
Then you scream
And scream (x10)
You pinned my arm to the couch
Like a banshee, inside a banshee, inside a scream
You pinned my arm to the couch
And then I scream
And scream (x10)

Then I wake the whole house up
(Then I wake the whole car up)
Then I wake the whole car up
And then I wake up the whole block
Then I wake up
Tense

[Hook]
I see you all the time now
I see you all the time
I see you all the time now

[Outro]
I told you I loved you
You said whatever
Last forever
It's a shame

I see you all the time now
I see you all the time
I see you all the time
