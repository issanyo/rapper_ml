I don't know nothing about no cubists but the D leaves the Buddhist blessed
Sometime my gal Jueles leaves my ass stupid stressed
"Pick up this or that, cut off the TV too"
She wasn't saying nothing when I brought back 22
K's of the bread I won the Eliminator
I turned down the opportunity to be the Gladiator
That's called love and devotion and sacrifice
When I crushed Nitro into the wall in Powerball she didn't say nothing nice
Go into the garage start smoking cheeba like
Hold in the reefer blow it out by the speaker lights
So I can chill, calm down, take a shower, and shave then
Sometimes I wouldn't do nothing for Jueles these days
I sit back on the couch
Me and Jueles share ice
[?], [?], [?], and [?]
Ain't nothing 'bout nothing like sports or the game of heart to heart
She's deeper, I'm here like firing up GoKarts
But still, fit like batting glove or new broken-in catchers mitt
Or a new Lebaron door
Vince on the kitchen floor
We a perfect team
Scrabble team played team sport focus
She seven title "S-A-U-S-A-G-E"
I'm in front of the Polish Cart
Combined it's beautiful
Beautiful move, beautiful team, team play
Think about that
I'd do anything for Jueles
I'm sorry about the coat on the banister or TV too loud
She said watching me crush Nitro in Powerball and Joust too
She said she was so proud she couldn't say anything out-loud to talk
Cut on the kettle whistle up hot toddy for Juele
We went for a walk, cracked open an O.D
Leave us, alone
We in a private home owners zone
Buddhist and Cubist fit together like a Rubik's Cube
She thinks deeply, I know when I want food
She said she saw me on Power 50 playing Powerball
Nitro tried to step up crushed his shoulder straight into the wall
Or when I knocked him out in Joust
Or when his mouth piece flew out
She screamed so loud
It formed an image in clouds she took a picture
And when I came home, she was so proud she couldn't say nothing out-loud to the talk back in the day
Made her super proud that's called compromise
Kettle whistle, hot toddy
I got a case of the two of the O-D-O ULE
Winning games all night
Sometimes Polish Scrabble focus
She seven title "S-A-U-S-A-G-E"
I'm in front of the Polish
Now we in the evening
Settle down orneries
Invite from a new bud Donnie and his wife Connie to play more Scrabble
Doul's and hot toddies
Come play team things
Drink Doul's Drink hot toddies
She hot toddies I drink Doul's
Sometimes kettle whistles or hot toddy whiskey
Might grab all the dough
Throw the Frisbee outside
That's Buddhist and Cubists getting together for do this
I'm talking about ruthless doing it
I'm talking about teacher movement
She said I Scrabble full space, playing together
She seven title "S-A-U-S-A-G-E"
I'm in front of that Polish
That's called love and devotion and sacrifice
When I crushed Nitro into the wall in Powerball it wasn't nice
Jueles said when she saw me out-loud with clouds formed into something into the sky we saw the picture
She couldn't even say it out-loud when I came home because she was too proud to say the thing at home
That's called sacrifice and Jueles
