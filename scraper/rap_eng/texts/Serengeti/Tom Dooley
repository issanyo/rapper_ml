[Verse One]
They said I met her on the mountain
And there I took her life
They said I met her on the mountain
And stabbed her with my knife

[Chorus]
They told me, "Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Hang down your head and cry
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Poor boy, you're bound to die"

[Verse Two]
By this time tomorrow
Reckon where I'll be
Hadn't of been for Grayson
I'd of been in Tennessee

[Chorus]
They told me, "Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Hang down your head and cry
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Poor boy, you're bound to die"

[Verse Three]
I know they're gonna hang me
Tomorrow I'll be dead
Though I never even harmed a hair on poor little Laurie's head

[Chorus]
They told me, "Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Hang down your head and cry
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Poor boy, you're bound to die"

[Refrain]
Poor boy, you're bound to die
Poor boy, you're bound to die
Poor boy, you're bound to die
