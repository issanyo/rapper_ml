[Hook]
Yeah I need love, yeah I need love
Like a second needs an hour
Like a raindrop needs a shower
Yeah I need love
Every minute of the day
And it wouldn’t be the same
If you ever should decide
To go away
Yeah I need love, yeah I need love
Yeah I need love, yeah I need love
Yeah I need love, yeah I need love
Yeah I need love, yeah

[Verse 1]
Your girl won’t look like Deschanel
She might look like hell
She won’t dance on the table
Or be shaped like a bell
You won’t try some new cuisine
Or finally get lean
That’s when the whimsy begins
Remember, just stay clean
Don’t let anybody take your energy
Cousins are creepy
[?] sorta like a centipede
Plus his pops
Your flat made and a funky socks
You’re more garage than gun
Remember, don’t stop, the time is now
Drink tea and lay it down
Get some rest, your boss could really matter less
We’re here for you
You know everyone here does adore you
Once your beats come out
The world will bow before you
You got love to give like a pyramid
So throw your hands up
Relax, don’t tense up
Now you all okay
Used to be bankrupt
So many kids from the same cup
It’s called the rhythm of devotion
Used to be thirsty, now you drink the ocean
So smooth, don’t need no lotion

[Hook]
Yeah I need love, yeah I need love
Yeah I need love, yeah I need love
Yeah I need love, yeah I need love
Yeah I need love, yeah

[Outro]
They had such good rapport
When they started their fling
When it ended
He was no longer considered a king
And the reading slowed
Cigarettes stained his healing robes
And when she left the Palisades
And started stealing clothes
My wife’s bull was a hibachi chef
Peppers and the sharpest knife
The way that he would
