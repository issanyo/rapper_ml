[Intro]
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
I really think it’s time

We know Spanish and karate
It’s different now, I’ll show you how
Friends for dinner, we feed the geese
Manhattan beach, Miami, honey
I’ll start painting, painters swimming
Miami leaning, New York dinner
We’ll set the table, we’ll eat together
We’ll make leather summer sweaters
We’ll go peppers, we’ll go hunting
This is something Diana Fresco
We’ll eat Cuban, pick up Spanish
We’ll go dancing, we’ll eat pumpkins

[Hook]
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
I really think it’s time
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
I really think it’s time

I really think it’s time

Believe me this time, we’ll go mainstream
We’ll eat tapas, I’ll be an actor
You an actress, I'll carve knick-knacks
Make you cinnamon, get a puppy
Name him Benjamin, dance all night then
Kiss you, darling, I’ll be clean like
Plates for starving, can't you trust me?
Oh no, fuck me, ah shit, fuck you
I call fresh too, I don’t need this
I’ll go dancing by myself, then
I don’t need this, I don’t need this
I’ll go dancing by myself, then
This is for you, I don’t like pets
Or Miami, I stay solo, I’m fine alone
My home I’ve had without you mad
All the time, this is fine
I’ll eat indoors, I’ll speak English
I don’t need this, this is for you
I’m fine alone, this is for you, I don’t need this, man

[Hook] (x2)

I really think it’s time

[Outro]
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
We’ll go dancing
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
I really think it’s time
