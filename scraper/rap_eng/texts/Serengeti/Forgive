[Verse 1]
Dream big, sleep well dreams
Grow so big that I’m bursting at the seams
I knew a guy who moved to Queen
Hung out with the teens
Every day was a new epiphany
Might as well get you on a [?] at Tiffany's
Cultivate your hinterlands, hey hey, let's go
Work hard every day, every day the fast lane
Bad man, bad flow, spitting mad game
Shoot to kill, go harder, break a hater's will
Bottom line, bank bill, get the bread and chill
Bounce overseas, icy like it’s four degrees
Hard to please, make the ladies weaker in the knees
Your day’s done, mine’s just begun son
Devil on my shoulder told him I’m the chosen one
Corruption, greed, all that a fellow need
Rappers need to proof read cause they cream cheese
Salty, wake you up like coffee
Won’t back down, won’t stop me
Get off of me
Black widow
In the middle
Black widow

[Verse 2]
Ready, aim, shoot
Anything to get the loot
If you’re getting money, homie
Then they say salute
It don’t compute, the flow is mad resolute
I kick a freestyle rap like a parachute
Afraid of who?
You must be nuts, cashew
When the game is tit for tat
Don’t be still like a statue
So I wanna grind so my money grow
Back against the wall, I’m going out like geronimo
I’m not hashtag anything really
I’m just the Geti King
Spaghetti string, got ripped cut
And I saw everything
Wedding ring got swapped out for maybe ketamine
The mezzanine, straight to the top
I work for everything

[Verse 3]
Ain’t no honour amongst criminals
Don’t need no team, I’m a one man general
One man army like the sentinel
Move like a calico prime in my pinnacle
Rap like a mineral
You on the sidelines, all interval
Catch me working hard every day, identical
Diversify the game, octopus, eight tentacles
I came and broke the mold same old principles
Black widow
