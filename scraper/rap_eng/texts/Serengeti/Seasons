[Verse 1]
You can spend a whole kilowatt
Ghost dance in Oregon
Open up your origins so you can find the Lord again
Just please don't hoard again
Dreams of a treasure trove
It's really just kite strings
Miss pink potato nose
White denim raver clothes
Turtlenecks and flannel coats
Parts of old drift boats
Auto repair brake quotes
Mad films by Glenn Close too

[Hook]
The cycles of the seasons change
I'm turning into shards of clay
I haven't had the perfect time yet
I'm betting on myself again
I'm betting on myself again

[Verse 2]
Mad films with Glenn Close
Go north to the frontier
Fossil hunt in Alaska
All we found was deer
Thanks to the Jubilee all debts have been cleared
Let's go celebrate, buy something expensively weird
It's like bells on bobsleds keeping me up late
A four year affair with a woman named Irate
Ringing in my ear like "How the hell can I germinate? We should just terminate"
What's the wait, what's the mate?
Rather be glutenous, than have a long long great time
[???]

[Hook](x3)

[Outro]
And cycles of the seasons change
She will not fly on aeroplanes
