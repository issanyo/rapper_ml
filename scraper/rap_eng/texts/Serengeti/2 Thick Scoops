I thought when I'm older that my hair would turn blond and grow to my shoulders
(It didn't, wrong)
I'm dating a call girl
My best friend's a dealer it seems
Sounds good, sounds nice, sounds nice
I thought I'd turn blond
Before I was wrong (wrong)
Let's start this king kong
(Pause, hey)

Yo my kids don't like me
My wife got huge (fat)
I'm far away from sand and brunettes with big tubes (blues)
Got no career (no) and money talks over here (yeah)
I went to prom my cumberbund was a beautiful sheer
And flowers matched
I was as cold as a ice patch
I used to watch side out and dream of changing my name to Zach
My garden's blinds
Volleyball practice in bronze
Me and beavis was free as Anthony Kiedis stuck in Chicago
Sloppy joes or hard tacos?
Some rule snow and ice for the rest of the shrubs
Who needs LA right?
Southern Cal and neon stripes shakes and brunettes
And wonderful volleyballs

I'm dating a call girl
My best friend's a dealer too (fuck it)
I thought when I'm older that my hair would turn blond and grow to my shoulders
(It didn't go longer)
Let's go

We teach the horse special
Quiver won't quell start some shit over
Intimidating blond male
Out of bounds my serve cells (damn it)
Met bathing suits little breast sweat (yeah)
Booths walking off cramps
One spike the whole place got amped (Yes)
A dive (uh huh) installed them boss
Served wide (yes) with everything you got (yes)
Great digs and beautiful blocks (yes)
You win the tournament (yes)
I won't go (no)
To go with this shit (no) is permanent like (no)

My wife, she's huge
It's like she ate a tire, shit
(Yeah, you look good, you look good, baby)
My kids are terrible... serious
(forest fires, out of control raging homicidal...)
And I'm fucking a call girl
(Hey baby why don't you suck down...)
I thought when I'm older I would turn blond
Darkest king kong, now boy I was wrong
