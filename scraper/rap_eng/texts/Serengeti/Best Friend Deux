[Intro]
Peace to Hi-Fidel

[Verse 1]
And it’s sorta like a summer home from college
Feeling totally exonerated, drinking beer that’s [?]
And going to the club like we got plans
Examining some chick’s glands in the back of a van
Magic hands and magic game
City summer [?]
Midnight parties on back porches
Melodies like [?]
Crystal skies and [?]
They also roll through
Like yeah, this is a flirt
This is how it’s gonna work
We gonna wake up when the
[?], capeesh?
Bonfires like straight off the leash
Summer home from college
It’s three month long freak

[Hook]
Yo, action, came back with some traction
Came through the back door looking for some action
A little more fun, my time on earth ain’t out
Came back fresher and fresher
And fresher and different
Came back specific
Sipping [?]
Chicago city, that [?] is quite spiffy
Model came out the john sniffy
I got a lot of flavour in me
They got a lot of [?] in them

[Verse 2]
Y’all right wing rappers be like [?]
I don’t believe that most of the population wants [?]
So where there’s a will
There’s a spot where it’s chill
[?] chess boards and refills
Not overkill, we done it for the sake of evil
More beautiful and special for the sake of people
I’m serious, more serious than empty rap threats
More serious than a week’s pay on a blackjack bet
So love more, understanding and peace
And goodwill
I’m sure that there’s a place that we can find that’s more chill
I’m sure that there’s a place that we can find that’s more chill
I’m sure that there’s a place that we can find

[Hook]
Yo, action, came back with some traction
Came through the back door looking for some action
A little more fun, my time on earth ain’t out
Came back fresher and fresher
And fresher and different
Came back specific
Sipping [?]
Chicago city, that [?] is quite spiffy
Model came out the john sniffy
I got a lot of flavour in me
They got a lot of [?] in them

[Outro]
Word, big up my guy Hi-Fidel
Yo, big up my man DJ Crucial
This dedicated to my best friend

[Interlude]
Yo, it’s [?]
I’m coming at you like this
Life’s a struggle
Your life’s a bubble
I’ll leave you fools watching Flintstones
Like Barney Rubble
I’m full of trouble
But I love God as much as my mother
I’m capable of being the next great thing
Like my nigga Serengeti
