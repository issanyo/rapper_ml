I'm dark, like bitten by a shark
Over her-on spot, it takes over a park
That's scary, look at the monster you married
You never really know someone till you're both buried
Deep in debt, fights for respect
Now when you both paid, about to build a second deck
Goddammit
You make people nervous
Turn into a serpent, turn into a circus
My turn please, Geti Coon King-Master of the Neegs
Master of everything bush league
One flight up steps you feel all fatigued
Or get a new job and realize you can't read
Stabbed in the back, anxiety attack
This ain't the way that your buddy supposed to act
Me and the wife were going to get matching tats
Oh my dear, how lovable is that?
Light as a feather, stiff as a dead cat-Like
And all the games that kids play
Beat you to death cause humans do not say-Nothing
Look at the monster you're spooning
You never really know someone till you're both ruined
Covered in mud, eating patties of blood
Shit happened quick like a fucking flash flood

-Chorus-
Off the tracks and on the mat, and oh, it's getting old

Sleeping with my wallet and my keys in my pocket
On a pool table somewhere out in Stockton
Cell phone dead, bank account empty
When so-and-so was your age she was pushing a Bentley
Change rolled out, fell in the side pocket
Crumpled up photos, a dead girls locket
Thigh bruises, that's a trait that your woman uses
Maybe she's shooting up, or just bumping into stuff
Who knows? That's the way that the river flows
Search her clothes, the odometer on the car knows
I'm harsh, like drowning in a marsh
Or taking a Xanax then drinking some Sparks
Fall apart, crumble like colossus
The roads've been messy and I haven't had galoshes
Driving down a dark path then you hit an ostrich
Feathers and blood, tires stuck in the mud
Modest man, accept that you're a peasant
Maintaining a slub life really ain't pleasant
Diner town, job as a hospital clown
Give the kids a laugh crying in the bath
Indie flick-like, but nobody's taping
There ain't no credits, there ain't no escaping
Fuck it, like Asian towns in the jungle
Last Man standing like the first royal rumble

-Chorus-
Off the tracks and on the mat, and oh, it's getting old. x2
