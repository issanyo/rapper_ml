[Intro]
It’s a unfair world and cruel
But you can be cool

[Verse 1]
That’s a okay start
I never seen a racehorse pissed
But I can add to the list
I’ve been having a great time
Since I gave up [?]
Only towards the future
On this old hip hop shit
I like that, I wanna tell you I like rap
Not reinventing the wheel
Getting my life back
Love L.A., I might take a flight back
Never been to Vegas before
Like a nightcap

[Verse 2]
I can’t remember the last time
I heard about a flasher
In the 80’s there was one in town rumoured
It was the pastor
Actually, yeah, it turned out to be old ass bastard
Challenging kids to races, telling them he was faster
But he knew he was slower
Told people he was a grower
All the rumours about the pastor
Finally made him get sober
Then he moved to Queens
Danced with wayward teens
‘What you doing’, they all asked
Said he about to have a blast

[Hook]
It’s a cold cold world
But you don’t gotta be
It’s a cold cold world
But you ain’t gotta be
It’s a cold world and cruel
But you don’t have to be cruel
It’s a cold world and cruel
But you can still be cool
