[Verse 1]
Feel the magnetism and the rhythm like a prism
Right before your eyes, and realise it wasn’t hidden
Life is for the living, make you feel like a mortician
You the new edition, made you feel like a magician
Everyone’s [?] cause this isn’t competition
Right before your eyes, and realise it wasn’t missing
Go go go go

[Verse 2]
Each and every [?]
Fly round the globe
I don’t care if you’re in control
Get so high like a totem pole
You can win the bronze, silver, and the gold
Clap clap, curtain call
Ego so big that you won’t [?] all night
Better have [?] on the wall
Many ways you can see the light
You got higher than a hawk
You can feel the beat in the street
Feeling like a star cause you louder than guitar
Brighter than the lightning, look at how you shining
Stronger than a Viking, you are like a bull
Stronger than before, you are like a dream
Sweating like the sun, feel forever young
Faster than a rocket, like electric in a socket
Like you’re so

[Hook]
Party party, I’ll be fighting everybody here
Go on all around the world [?]
Throw your hands up higher than a chandelier
North, south, to the east, west, everywhere
So let’s go, party party man, I’m [?]
Bout to have another party
Then we hit the aftershow
