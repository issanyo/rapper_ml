[Intro: Yoni Wolf]
Got a real buzz to it, but that's alright

[Serengeti]
Quick, let me get drunk as fast as I can
So, I can fall asleep
And pretend to be a different man
(That's fucked up)
You know, the one that’s an architect
Is this a case of the grass is greener or is the shit more fresh?

[Yoni Wolf]
I'd say the latter

[Verse 1: Serengeti]
That’s harsh
Like drowning in a sticky marsh
All your skeleton’s unveiled
Man, this life was dark, like Gargamel
The only saving grace was that he did a song with Jel
(How much did he charge you?)
Yo, Geti life, laying next to the sweaty wife
Hey, man, can I borrow your mind? (No!)
I really need a hit, it’s been a long time
Like seedlings growing to be giant pines
I should've stayed in school
Everything was cool
Hey, Yoni
(Yeah?)
I really need a hit
Something quick, this shit has been an embarrassment
I wanna be on film, too, so I hired a film crew
It got expensive
That’s the job
People get hired to do
I also got taken by the gypsies in Berlin, too
No marble, we’re like twins, dark corner in basketball courts with meants
I told her I could get her close to Yoni, I was lying, though
I told her I could get her close to Yoni, I was lying, no, we’re not really homies
(Huh? For real?)
It was getting later
I think she got the picture
She became silent, wouldn’t that be your Geti life?
Laying next to the sweaty wife?
Yoni’s world, laying next to one of Yoni’s girls

[Verse 2]
I always wanted to be on a record label
Always wanted to have my own show on cable
My favorite team is '87 Cubs
I love Hawk Dawson
I never felt awesome!
It’s always been a huge problem
I have a huge nose like that woman on Blossom
Peeps to Jel and my man Odd Nosdam
I live in Chicago, but in California often
(On the middle west)
Always wished my name was Otto
Everybody has a dream that they'll win the Lotto
Or at least move to Abu Dhabi
I made it to the orange belt on Shotokan karate
I’m drinking some, buddy
Wish I had a friend or a decent hobby
(Shit.)
My favorite show is tennis!

(Have you been listening to me?!)

Often on tilt, Often off balance
I'm getting older, so I hang around MILFs
So I hang around-
Movies by myself and feel intense guilt
I write a lot!
My head will explode!
Do a lot of music, shit's written in secret code
Catch me on a commode, explode
Geti life, laying next to the sweaty wife
YEAAHHHHHHH
