[Verse 1]
I was the happiest man in Glassell Park
Dark
Ice life, nine cold
Chopped from a door mind hold
Forgot all the time
Since I bought these cloaks
And waistband belt ropes
I can't really speak unless I'm dreamin' of Elise
Who gives a shit when you're blitzed all the time, fool
This shit wears thin
Like staying in an inn pool
I was feeling clean
Like I built a limousine
And bought a little ketamine to dream

[Verse 2]
I was the happiest man in Glassell Park
Divorce is the new wedding
Stop is the new start
LL and Art [?] hit me on the backbone
Call you on the grunk four and meet you in the dingdome
Metaphor rap man
Tired last rap clan
Hang it up
It's not enough
To wake up on a night stand
The happiest man near Glassell Parks, lakes
Sit on the couch, watch a movie, eat a whole cake
A nice rom-com
Set in a southern state
Twist it with a femme fatale like Parmesan spaghetti plate
Parmesan spaghetti plate
The happiest man in Glassell Park
In history...
