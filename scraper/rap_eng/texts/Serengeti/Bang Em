You like 'em, you bang 'em
You like 'em, you bang 'em
Sometimes, you don't like - but you still bang 'em

You like 'em, you bang 'em
You like 'em, you bang 'em
Sometimes, you don't like - but you still bang 'em


Can't stop Davis it is Dennis
Base Dennis: Miles Davis
Potatoes carrots eyes strengthen
O'Neal - retired
Kenny bankin'
Makin' bacon, Kevin dancin'
Pictures playing, people singing
Is it Davis, it is Dennis, Franklin eatin' playin' tennis
Aces cases
Green bottles
Bottles clean
Women models
Ladyboy dancin'
T is Latanya
Nephew Dennis
DeeDee  my momma

You like 'em, you bang 'em
You like 'em, you bang 'em
Sometimes, you don't like - but you still bang 'em

You like 'em, you bang 'em
You like 'em, you bang 'em
Sometimes, you don't like - but you still bang 'em

It's the Deacon Kenny speakin'
Step to Tha Teachaz
Your nose will be leakin' all on the streets and
Your girl will be screamin'
I told you the KDz
Won't stop a vegan
Buying, drinking also thinkin'
Straight from the ground cause I was not playin'
I got styles and I am amazing, oh
I am tenacious, my delta is spacious
Kill like the Deacon - it is contagious
Gracious, helpful, also courageous
Michael Dudikoff: American Ninja
Ain't been to China
Ain't been to Denver

You like 'em, you bang 'em
You like 'em, you bang 'em
Sometimes, you don't like - but you still bang 'em

You like 'em, you bang 'em
You like 'em, you bang 'em
Sometimes, you don't like - but you still bang 'em

You like 'em, you bang 'em
You like 'em, you bang 'em
Sometimes, you don't like - but you still bang 'em

We are in tune to the KDz Killa Deacon
I wanna give a  shoutout to my brother Tanya
Or uh, Latanya - that's ladyboy
And my momma
The DeeDee Deacon
And the whole thing about her
In that first verse - the end of it
I wasn't trying to say that Tanya and my mama, you bang 'em, uh
It's a metaphor for life:
You gotta get out and do something!
You gotta get out and do something!
You gotta get up and do something!
You bang 'em!
You like it you bang it!

Sometimes you don't wanna go to work but you still gotta bang it!
You gotta bang it!

You gotta bang it!
You like it!
You bang it you do it you like it you do it!
Sometimes you gotta do shit you don't wanna do!
Metaphor!

Shouts to my mama
Y'all must be crazy
Step to the Deacon
Step to the Deacon
Whole face leaking we'll see your girl screaming
You don't want that 'n'
I don't want that
I'm a peaceful man
And though I ain't no beacon
Alright I ain't no vegan
Props to the vegan respects to 'em but I ain't no vegan
