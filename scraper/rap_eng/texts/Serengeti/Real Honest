[Verse 1]
Keep smiling, stay styling
Stay gold, not even cold
Hot enough to melt the mould
It’s ultra fresh
Sharp as British bayonets
We don’t need no nets
Just come correct
It’s real honest
Straight up [?] I promise
I’m astonished
Asteroids and frozen comets
It’s not garnished
Rap sizzle, go for the gusto
Don’t let go, what you think?
The brink is our decision to motivate

[Verse 2]
Like I was chilling in my skivvies
The boys are back in town like Thin Lizzy
Who the hell is he?
Apache gunman, desperado
Are you mulato?
A foot on the throttle
Come home and hit the bottle
Like yeah, this is good
This is how it really should be
[?]
Kiss who you wish
Think about how much fun and excitement
It’s gonna be, it’s like go nuts
[?]
What, no time to be
Door shut, it’s okay, that’s enough
And here’s a [?]
Ride your magic thing to the moon
Consume the stars
Evaporate the [?]
Cause you got it, you owe it to yourself
You owe it to us
So let’s go nuts, let’s go crazy
You owe it to me
You owe it to yourself
You owe it to us
You owe it to yourself
You owe it to us

[Hook]
[?]
Circle by the fence like us
Free to roam
But locked in our brains
It’s such a shame
The smartest animals should be on higher plains
Instead we only play games and deal with guns
Especially as Buddhist Americans

[Verse 4]
Fake rap, pass that
Let me hit that
Let me do my thing with a broken wing
Cause we all sing, we all tell rhyme
We all in our prime
We all part of design
This is hip-hop
States, just in case
For Pete’s sake, the great lakes
The stargates to the moon
To the roof like straight [?]
Cantaloupe, [?], the iron suit
Until it fold, don’t fit the mould
Until it’s go, totem pole, the black hole
We all spin, hold me down again, bla bla
We’re the author, where the style
Wow to the now, my file, my raps and these tracks
Samples and hi-hats, like that
Wrap around, turn and twist, how about a kiss?
[?]
This is great, this is trouble, this is subtle
This is [?], it’s all three, just us
It’s just us, it’s just us, it’s just us
We are free, it’s just us

[Hook]
[?]
Circle by the fence like us
Free to roam
But locked in our brains
It’s such a shame
The smartest animals should be on higher plains
Instead we only play games and deal with guns
Especially as Buddhist Americans
