Clatter of washing plates
Dinner was so good
Soaps like cereal
And living room wall wood
Home is the best place
Tending to fish tanks
Hiding your hidden traits
I hid in your hidden traits

Clatter of washing plates
Dinner was so good
Soaps like cereal
And living room wall wood
Home is the best place
Tending to fish tanks
Hiding your hidden traits
The cover of washing plates
Hid in you hidden traits
Hid in your hidden traits
Hid in your hidden traits

If I could redo it all
I'd redo it all
And say that you look nice tonight
If i could redo it all
I'd redo it all
And say that you look nice tonight
And say that you look beautiful
And make you smile bright tonight
And feel like the saint you are
And flowers grow towards the moon
And say that you sound beautiful
I'd say that you sound beautiful
If i could redo it all
I'd redo it all
And say that you look nice tonight
And say that you look nice tonight
