Hey
Grab the pong paddle
Second serve nine to eight
Missed the white tape
Then rattled off 20 straight
Firm handshake
Hey fellow have a great day
Could only play one game
When I heard my name (Who the hell is that)
It was the fellows Ders
Inviting me for a steak
It's not hard being the D's but being the D's is great
Racquetball court sweaty smell thick
Moist room thick glass
Bounce blew off
Sound muffle get down
Goggles playing Boggle
Words spelling "Hey Hey"
Ride and wore pony
Jueles wanted a pony
Then she bought an IROC
Then she bought a Cougar
I won the American Gladiators D's Paul Ruggeri

Hey
Hey there buddy guy
Hey there buddy guy
Clam down buddy guy
Take a shower and shave guy
Hey there buddy guy
Pipe it down calm down

Granddad's on stairs
Bungalow wrong way
Dormer home too hot
Summer time new fan
More fans cool it down
Cooled down dormer home
Calm down pipe it down

Bumping too much come on
Hey there buddy guy
Calm down buddy guy
Take a shower and shave guy
Hey there buddy guy
It ain't hard being but the D's but being the D

Calm down buddy guy
