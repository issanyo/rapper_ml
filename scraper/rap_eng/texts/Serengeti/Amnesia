[Verse 1]
If I can get amnesia
See you with fresh brown eyes
We can finally split up
And stop bossing around
If I can get amnesia
If I can get amnesia
If I can get amnesia
I wouldnâ€™t have to fake my death

[Verse 2]
Start to getting somewhere, maybe
Change my name to Peter Penagos
Find love in Quito
And get the fuck out of Lagos
Buy my own street cart
Specialize in beef hearts
Be a man of the people
Be a man of the people

[Outro]
If I can get amnesia
If I can get amnesia
If I can get amnesia
And see you again
