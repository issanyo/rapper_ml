[Intro: Hi-Fidel as PMDF]
Yeah
Grimm Teachaz
Run and tell your preacher
Fresh from '93
I be the PMDF
With my man KDz

(Kenny Dennis!)

And Son Doobie (yo)

[Verse 1: Hi-Fidel as PMDF]
I get super metaphysical when rockin' a rhyme
Hip hop, tick tock
Like I'm dropping a bomb
Went to my brother Rassan
I put that on the Holy Qu'ran
Twist a joint from the weed on my lawn
Light it up, toke it, hold it
When I smoke it, I go for broke kid
Don't front
You know I got you open
This hand pops a Glock and this one's for smokin' the pot
Not the one with the peas in it
The any green leaf with no seeds in it
Wholesome, just like whole grain
Cause when it gets in you you feel no pain
Unless you step up to my crew in the cypher
Actin' like you wanna battle
I'll slaughter you like cattle
I'm not a snake with a tail that rattles
I rock bells till you're sleepless in Seattle
HOLD UP
I set the mic on fire
Off the top ropes cause I get higher
Your crew's washed up, throw you in the dryer
Call me sire - flip the script like Maya Angelou
Rip you up like an animal
Run you like an antelope
And cut you like a cantaloupe
What can you do?
Swing, off goes your head
So grab your tight crew and run off to bed

[Verse 2: Serengeti as Kenny Dennis]
I get specific, I rip it
You know you can't resist it
A 40 and a blunt when I get lifted
When I get distance, Rushin'; Attack!
Call me the grim reaper cause I'm dressin' in black!
Frere Jacques, Frere Jacques
Destroy your whole crew like boom shakalaka
Increase the peace? NO!
Increase the violence
One false move have your crew in silence
Mad flavors
Roll with the heathens
Bitches on my nuts like intoxicated demons
Shakin' up shit like a game of Yahtzee
Mariachi, paparazzi
Color me bad - no!
Color me great
When the shit hits the fan I got nothin' to say
Destroy your crew like a game of Battleship
A4 quadrant
Aye-aye Sergeant!
One single verse destroys your whole squadron
BOOM
Like Hiroshima
Your crews lookin' soft, but mine is meaner
Regina, Steemer, Carpet Cleaner
I rock fresh rhymes from here to Pasadena
Catch me in a Beemer
The girl from Ipanema
Roll me the reefer
Pass it to the chiefer
In the Suzuki
Extraterrestrial
Zuzuzu and I don't eat vegetables
Destroy you - shit, that's incredible!
Crews are edible
Pick up the decibel
Boom! boom! boom!

[Verse 3: Son Doobie]
I getz smoke like a double oh, indestructible
You're 90 million volts just like a thunderbolt
This for the faux nuts there's no doubt delectable
Punch a hole right through your heart just like The Crucible
You all better know
I chill in beach bungalows
I don't get caught naked swimming in the undertow
Gullible funk my arsenal's colorful
Your buffalo scratch and battle rap disrupts the flow
Urban warfare the surface
Life's like a circus
Sherman tanks swervin' and hit the dirt
Now you nervous
First you know your whole crew'll be chicken like Church's
I work my Earvin magic here a lot like Merlin
Work my Hermann Munster fro and death man and servant
Girls prefer this
Why you think I sip bourbon?
I've served a purpose
You heard this coercion
Determine how it works burning spit out the furnace
