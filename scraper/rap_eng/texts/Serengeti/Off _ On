[Verse I]
So when you talk about the town
All you want to say is gang trouble
You never mention BJ Armstrong or the legends Horace and Harvey
Never mention Rodgers Park or driving down Touhy
Or Morgan Park in PH
Class of 70 in your head
House stings
Or Bruce Lee and how he lived off of 83rd
Or when Spring hits you could notice the return of birds
But it's only gang problems
I don't know how you're so adjusted
My RO is custom
At the light next to Buster's

[Hook]
Turn it off, turn it oh, turn it back up
Turn it off, turn it on, turn it back up
Turn it back up

[Verse II]
Badge of honor talk tales it was double in the 70's, what gives?
Big trouble back then it was still trouble now
Jacuzzi Ruby Tuesday coupon movie day
Let me talk about how me and J
The whole thing let it slip away
Hanging out in [?] too much with my buddy Joji
New shipment of the Benz
Called me on the horn told me to come in
Jueles hates shows so does Curtis and Maurine
I still regret the time when Tha Teachaz broke up we didn't hear it when we had steam
I don't want to talk about that or gang troubles as a talking point
I'd rather talk about the Shockwave and Fast Pass
And fast back body
These waves and Dennis McKinnon
Instead of gang troubles
Hanging out with Joji and new women blending in with the ceiling
Because Irene cares same what a feeling
I sing about what I feel

[Hook]
