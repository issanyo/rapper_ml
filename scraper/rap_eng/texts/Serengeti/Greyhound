[Verse 1]
I got a seat by myself on the Greyhound
There was a fight in the ticket line
I was by in time outside of Memphis
Weekly raid off the express way
I burned every bridge I’ve ever build
It’s time to see what I’m made of
It’s time to see what I’m made of

[Verse 2]
I walk into a bar
Ten past midnight
Hey, how are you doing, darling?
I hope you’re feeling alright tonight
Pardon me, my man, you see, I don’t think the lady minds
We can do this two ways
We can step outside, bottom line

I burned every bridge I own
It’s time to see what I’m made of
No more horsing around, ‘cause
It’s time to see what I’m made of
