[Verse 1]
I'm laying down, I fold you in
I fight the cold old windows, grim
I'm broke and weak, I tried to fight
The 2 am train old tonight

[Chorus: Serengeti and Skyler Stonestreet]
(Oh I really love my life)
I feel like it's paradise
(Oh I really love my life)
It reminds me of Vincent Price

[Verse 2]
I can't ever see returning back
It's too dull my walls are thin
Black dark, darkest sky
And a slice of the devil's pie

[Chorus: Serengeti and Skyler Stonestreet]
(Oh I really love my life)
I feel like it's paradise
(Oh I really love my life)
It reminds me of Jesus Christ
(Oh I really love my life)
Cause everything will be alright
(Oh I really love my life)
Everything will be alright

[Verse 3]
I'm leaving town, this ain't livin'
I find the sun too cold, too dim
Broke and weak, collapse collapse
I tried to battle but I couldn't relax

[Chorus: Serengeti and Skyler Stonestreet]
(Oh I really love my life)
I feel like it's paradise
(Oh I really love my life)
It reminds me of Miami Vice
(Oh I really love my life)
Cause everything will be alright
(Oh I really love my life)
Cause everything will be alright
