So, things started to really slow down for me in LA
Didn't really have anybody calling
But you know, what's up what's down
So I thought why don't I get away from all this
Leave LA
Get back to Chicago
Pick up the phone
Call Kenny
And see what he's up to
And he ain't up to shit
[Kenny Dennis]: I am up to shit
Which was good because I'm like...
[Kenny Dennis]: I do a lot of things
Let's do something
Let's get together
Why don't we go on tour?
Why don't we start a little group and start rapping together?
He was fully down and I'm like
Well let's go

[Kenny Dennis]
Ok, let's go do this
Bet big, win big
Lose big
Can't break even
No Even Stevens
You gotta bet big!
Win big, lose big
