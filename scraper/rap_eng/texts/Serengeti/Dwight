[Verse 1: Serengeti]

Bookstores that take in cats, how beautiful is this?
As beautiful as the Swiss or oceanic abyss
As beautiful as a kiss near a prostitute's hips
You fall in love with and move to the shore by the ships
A new life, a beautiful new wife, assorted pasts of sorts
As beautiful as a Porsche, as beautiful as learning Norse
As beautiful as a bookstore that'll take in a horse
A wonderful new pad, a beautiful new job, beautiful bay windows
The perfect route to jog
A bigger kitchen
Dinner parties and less tension
Endless possibilities, disputes handled civily
Getting to know the wife, the excitement of living in Dwight
Neighbours are great, the aromas cuz' the neighbours bake
Until a 'oh-oh!', something smells fishy
The upcoming years, cause quite the tizzy
The drive down is quicker, the way back is longer
Is this killing us, cuz' it's making us sombre?
Blinds always closed, this byzantine ode
Beautiful kitchen once, suitcases on the stove, we used to take baths in lakes on the ocean floor

[Verse 2: Serengeti]
Beautiful French artistry, a detailed door
What happened to bookstores that would take in a boar
Beautiful bay windows drawn closed Eleanor
You're sleeping outside, all our friends died
Our beautiful new apartment, turned into a dive
We used to speak Norse and pluck hairs from each other's chests
Now I walk over you in the morning on the back steps
No goodnight: no more trots to and from the docks
No more window shopping for books or boutique clocks
But I do remember, the oceanic abyss
As beautiful as a kiss as beautiful as the Swiss

No goodnight
No goodnight
No goodnight
No goodnight
No goodnight
No goodnight

This Byzantine ode was hard to write
