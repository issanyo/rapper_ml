[Verse 1]
I’m a rapper that tried desperately for a hit
The devil took a piece of it
Just for some [?]
So holy shit
[?]
Into abandonment style
Unbearable counterfeit
Shit I go pop
Made mad different stuff non-stop
Always a flop
Cause it’s straight from the bottom
Of the mountain’s peak
With the sun [?]
And the snow where the goats go
My goal to gaze in the [?]
And it’s tripped out though
The non-rap break to the top
To the top of the chart
They control the whole art
But it’s cool
I’m going pop like bubblegum drop
Young dumb fox
Cat in a box
Before we get [?]
Straight fake rate
Like cubs downtown
Ticker tape fete
Rule on which we all base
[?]
Mad taste, real cheesy
But be the extra creamy
Stone cold
[?] the middle of the globe
I watch the solar
I watch the sea roll
Chill like ultimate style [?]
Ice cream castle
Wonderwoman yellow truth [?]
Cause it’s a hastle
Pop tunes at the battle
The biggest thing was [?]
They need a baby rattle
Cause it’s the same dude
Who abuse that [?]
Ultimate body blow
The chicks at the bar that dig yo
Hang with the cooks
Brand guns and shoot [?]
Love things that bling
They forgot the sun still pull us
[?] for the love of Buddha
Dave [?]
Rap parthenon congruent
Divine things, we blew it
So pop we shall go
Hip-hop jingles
And processed like chips
Double dip chocolate in a cup
Dude throw up
By the ultimate body blow struck
I had the worst luck
That’s enough hush
Must I rush?
[?]
Float like a blimp
Or empty lilypad
The Serengeti [?]

[Verse 2]
But is that tight
Just wait a second dawg
Just wait a second on that whole rap catalogue
But what what what?
Keep it going tighter and fresh
We’re getting more than the rest
Uh huh, yeah, uh huh
[?]
The holiday [?]
But is that tight
Wait let me think, don’t blink
My black ink turn grey pink
It’s hijinks

[Verse 3]
Bring the pain
Bring the ruckus
[?]
Permanently trapped on that
Said I’ll forever speak
One way or another
It’s sorta like a mark
If anybody paid attention
And that’s the trick to make a decent song
Last long and that’s the hardest thing to do
At least it’s fun to attempt
And let’s say if it hit
And eating jumbo shrimp
On a boat by the lake
In a smoking coat, but doing coke
With a chick you see in [?]
Designer bags
[?]
And her friends
And wine glass
And my friends
And execs in a suit
On a lake
Waves make the boat shake
In the summer, say in June
Say the moon shines as bright as the sun
Plus the stars
And your song three minutes
Twelve seconds long
