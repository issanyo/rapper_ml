[Verse 1]
The sun's rising above the mountains
People on the bus and we're bouncing
From Oakland to LA, the nightway
Searching for an enlightened mind state
Spend our whole lives trying to get them straight
Dollar dollar bills
It's more than paying bills
Do as thou will
That's the luckiest kind
Wine busted open in my bag
Spilled everywhere, people are so mad
Morning time in LA is such a wonderful sad
So many of us
As we gathered our bags
Close
Heading to LA on hope
Close
Heading to LA on hope

[Verse 2]
She was crying in the abortion clinic
Her pimp's name was British
He was a mean son of a bitch
Who always hated tennis
The rackets, the courts, the scoring
The time honored tradition
I sat next to her and told her I would listen
"What are you, a superman?
An ex-marine hero?"
Stepped outside
Pimp
And a man that's new here
Just trying to be a gentlemen
Do better than last year
We will
Livin' in LA on hope
We're close

[Outro]
Ah ah
Erotic city
Erotic city
Erotic city

Spend our whole lives
Trying to get them straight

Erotic city
Ah ah ah
Erotic City
