[Verse]
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
One time, this kid, Bradly, left me with a broken shoulder
I had a new telephoto lenses, taking photographs of his second older sister, Gwen
Her form was divine, her blinds were slightly open as I hid behind a street sign
Then I moved behind a giant pine, she did yoga every night at about nine
Bradly wasn’t that tough, he had a Kansas city starter coat, his father sold soaps
The kind that look like shells, he dealt with distributers and chains of motels
Imagine how Gwen smells, her one legged king pigeon pose and her workout clothes
Inspiration like a muse, also, on the flying crow, she never wore shoes
That’s why I bought this new Canon at the china beach, pack up and head to Gwen’s street
Shit was an I.S., very ritualistic, she wore the same sweats
Warm up sweats, they were turbo green, I’d often think to myself “If I only had a trampoline”
Then she took off her pants, these photographs were our first found romance
I was only twelve, Bradly broke my shoulder when we fell off these garage shelves
We were just horsing around, I felt my shit pop when I hit the damn garage ground
I showed Gwen the photos years later when she was back in town

[Outro]
I took photographs of you, when you were younger
And now, I’m showing them to you
