[Verse 1: Serengeti]
Can you resist the urge of going on a shopping splurge
Coming home with hats and a kit to make curd?
This is how you curdle the shot like Steve Urkel
There's books by Studs Terkel and pet store gerbils
There's places to buy and sell turtles
T-shirt girdle tight, look good to feel right
Feel bad? Blame life, peace Steve Ryan light
You're the light, you're the light, you're the light

[Hook: Sufjan Stevens]
My, oh my, oh my, oh my

[Verse 2]
Yo enough about me though, you got a favorite game show?
Mine is called "I'm involved"
But nothing that the Manic Pixie Dream Girl can't solve
Nothing that's organic is impossible to dissolve
Great watch buzz uplifts millions
Go back to school and expand on your brilliance
You can spring back and say shit, I'm resilient
I'm crocodillian, catch me underwater
By the water buffalo and feed the alligator daughter
Yeah, great father, face hairy like Chewbacca
Taught the Dim Mak form from Senzo Tanaka
Don't use Binoca or chew gum either
Drink a lot of milk like my name was Ted Cleaver
Innocent America, dreams do change on Kane like Erica
Into Pine Valley before I bounced onto Caprica
Me and the wife and the kids up in the Acura
Happy as a bug in a rug, a clam in a dog
A pig in a log, a frog in a shark
Happy as the freedom of Yosemite National Park harpsichord
Ping-pong, Ding-dong rules of rap

[Sufjan Stevens]
My, oh my, oh my, oh my
My, oh my, oh my, oh my

[Serengeti]
Give it more than you can take
Give it more than you can take
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's--

[Outro: Serengeti]
Do you have a favorite game show?
I like Jeopardy, I like Wheel of Fortune
I like Facts of Life
Let's Make a Deal, Let's Make a Deal
S' and S' and S' and S'
S' and S' and S' and S'
Show me your S', don't care what your sex is
S' and S' and S' and S'
Show me your S', don't care what your sex is
(Let's dance, let's dance)
S' confesses the message is blessing
Show me your S' don't care what your sex is
S' and S' and S' and S'
S' confesses the message is blessing
