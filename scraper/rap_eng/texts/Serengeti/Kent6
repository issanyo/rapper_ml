[Intro]
It’s not a message, it’s my battery getting low
Sometimes it moves fast, sometimes it moves slow

[Verse 1]
Higher and higher, electric like a wire
We coming together to make the situation flyer
We on fire, live it up or just retire
You’re in it for life, sing it loud just like a choir
You can’t stop it, catch the ball, don’t drop it
Throw your hands in the sky, take them our your pocket
Be who you be, put the plug up in the socket
Crush it, it’s so fresh that you can’t trust it
All my ladies be like ‘yo, this is nothing’
All my fellas be like ‘yo, stop fronting’
And do something, my people make the party pumping
Made it on our own, we started out with nothing
Cause

[Hook]
It’s not a message, it’s my battery getting low
Sometimes it moves fast, sometimes it moves slow

[Verse 2]
One in a million, man, women, and children
Shouts to all the people loving life in the building
With no ceiling, you gotta love the feelings
Always keep it true to myself
I’m no chameleon, I don’t fake it
I get creative, we made it
High on life cause we the bravest, courageous
Did it my way, calculated, feel the celebration
Feel it in the walls and in the basement
You can feel the beat in the street and the pavement
Be here now, open up to the amazement
You be like ‘yo, man, this is my favourite’
Flip the script, right here, shit

[Hook]
It’s not a message, it’s my battery getting low
Sometimes it moves fast, sometimes it moves slow

[Outro]
And if you can’t seem to [?]
Raise your hands up
