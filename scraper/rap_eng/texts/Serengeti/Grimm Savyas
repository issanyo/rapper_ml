[Verse 1: Hi-Fidel as PMDF]
Swing swing, chop chop
With my cutlass sword
All I wanted to express: please prepare for war
By the grace of the Buddha, bless
I kill some stress and enemies that wanna step to the Smith and Wesson
Bliggity blow blow I'll lead you to the promised land
Where a doe, a zebra's arms and[?]
Each and every man and woman, children
The God believes in building
But my [?]
Decoy faith be born
If you're looking for the man, I'm the real McCoy
That specialize in killing
The wack MCs illing
And I'm wanted for less than pound, pence, or shilling
The body hasn't been since the sound it made was chilling
To the bone
My soul kinda shivered
A sliver of the blade made its way to his liver
It's a death blow delivered and sealed in stone
There's a war going on and you are not alone

[Bridge]
Ahh, Ahh
Ahh, Ahh
Ahh, Ahh
Ahh, Ahh

[Verse 2: Serengeti as Kenny Dennis]:
(check it)
Ho ho ho but I ain't Kringle
Deacon KDz more stars than Ringo
Janet Reno
I'm not gringo
One duck, two duck, three duck - bingo
Goose
Fuckin' with the Teachaz get a loose tooth
Under your pillow
Armadillo
Teachaz so rough like we are Brillo
This one hooper raps but he ain't ill though
He just goofy - no beats by Koufie
A lot of rappers sound like the Dz but loosely
So get your loose leaf - you'll need more pens
I get mad skins, Debbies, and Lynnes
You Mister Rogers, you pretend
You lady Elaine, my flow is insane
Like everything is A ok
Come and play, this ain't Sesame
This is threatening all MCs
Who can't read the lettering
T-E-A-C H-A-Z
I never wear Reebok

KDz is ill like I had to go to detox
But got kicked out when the doctor found my three Glocks
Took out Shaq once, he was a big load
Dunked on him too, knocked him out with a elbow
Who framed Roger Rabbit?
I did. GD? Enemy?
Who shot J R Kennedy?
Grim

[Verse 3: Micah James as MC-17]
Don't blink the villain is fast
Write my shit out - invisible ink and black pads
And a black mask get in that ass, yo
The devil got the black man wrapped in his lasso
Trapped up
And cops throwing the Gods into handcuffs
My man died before he took a hit on his last blunt
He told me the system is designed to love the phonies and the fools
Wish I 'membered all the jewels that he showed me
Cause the streets is ill every day is a dream
Naw a nightmare, I'm type-scared at age 17
But what am I to do?
I'm tryin' to get live and the niggas round the way is all mad 85in'
So I take my pen and my tablet
The Teachaz schooled me
And I was like that's it
The lightbulb went ding
And when I was 15 got knowledge of self
Cause all I needed was help
Word born
But still, shit is real yo - what am I to do?
I study all my lessons, or grab a .22
The nickel plated one
Not the one that's filled with brew, but I hit that too
And now I'm comin' for your crew
See, damn, confused yo - what does it mean?
Caught up in the world of unAmerican dreams
I ain't tryin to scheme, scam, or skim
But for a young black teen living in the world nowadays it's grim
