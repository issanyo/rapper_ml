I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineage, I curse the lineage, I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineages, I curse the lineages, I curse the lineages of them

Americans are so fat
Even the rats and pigeons
We eat sugars and fats
And go to the doctor
And say "my toe hurts
I saw some medicines on television I think may help me
What do you think?"
I eat a lot of hamburgers and drink
Smokin'
I don't meditate beneath the waterfalls for dozens of days
Almost like a master chef minus the mother fucking test
I also meditate in guano caves
There's so much ammonia there
The smells on me for days
Samurais got wars like plots and lands
Slaves got whipped and punched in the face and shit
So pay me
Here's my enemy's head
I would like a new pencil and a mother fucking  waterbed
When you hit rock bottom there's new depths
Like looking on the ground trying to find used cigarettes

I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineage, I curse the lineage, I curse the lineages of them

I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineage, I curse the lineage, I curse the lineages of them

Askin peoples can you buy me a drink
And they say, "get away creep, your breath stinks."
Jeepers, you had a nice girl but couldn't keep her
She was so motivated and you were such a sleeper
Known for saying, "ah, I'll do it tomorrow
And do you got a extra $20 bucks that I can borrow?"
I know that I haven't been lookin
But these bars are just really tough to get bookin's
Ah, shit you considering Rick Huff?
His raps are ordinary and I do the intense stuff
Fine, we'll see who gets farther
Four weeks later he's sponsored by her father
Son, we really like the way you treat our daughter
Glad she's not with you know who, know what I'm sayin?
So here's 25 grand and our support
My wife and I have thought this over
The ball's in your court

I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineage, I curse the lineage, I curse the lineages of them

A thing you never hear is
"I've eaten too many grapes"
A more likely slogan is
Motherfucker my period's late
Then a speech about we'll go through this together
More changes than Chicago weather however
It's like being old and only party with teens
Or being such a fiend that you're asking people for cream
Gee thanks, you're sorta like teen angst
Horace Greeley said "young man, go west"
I say go where can find nice breasts -
And make sure that you can always caress them
The thing about being spooked, is eat the cooch
You can trust me, I'm a rapper f-f- shit

I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineage, I curse the lineage, I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineage, I curse the lineage, I curse the lineage, I curse the mother fucking mother fucking lineages of them
I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineage, the fucking lineage, I curse the lineages of them
I curse the lineages
