[Verse 1: Serengeti]
All right
When you feel
Like you just can't stop
Jumping
And bumping
When you feel
Like you just can't stop
Sending telegram
After telegram
And when you feel like throwing (All right)
All your books in the air
You need to catch it
Just catch it
When you feel
Like you just can't stop (Can't stop)
Twisting and turning
And burning shit (wait a second, wait a second)

[Hook]
You need to calm it down
Calm it down
You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down
Calm it down
You need to calm it down
Calm it down
Calm it down
Calm it down
Calm it down
You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down

[Segue]
C-c-c-c-c-c-calm it down
C-c-c-c-c-c-calm it down
C-c-c-c-c-c-calm it down
C-c-c-c-c-c-

[Verse 2: Serengeti]
And when you feel (Like what?)
Like you just can't stop (Why's that? Why's that?)
Chasing your dreams
Impossible dreams
Impossible dreams
And when you feel
Like driving your car (Nope, nope)
Into a telephone pole
Just stop it
You got it (Hit the brakes)
And when you feel (Come on)
Like fucking shit up (Yeah)
Let's fuck shit up
Let's fuck shit up
Let's fuck shit up (See what happens if...)
And when you feel (How do you feel?)
Like you just can't stop (My bad)
Talking shit about each other
All the time
All the time

[Hook]

You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down

[Bridge]
When your fists don't fly (Yeah, calm it down)
When your grips don't got (OK, calm it down)
When your twerps don't tweak (You gotta calm it down)

[Verse 3: Sufjan Stevens and (Serengeti)]
I'm on my own two feet
But I'm not standing upright
Mine is the pressure
Mine is the pain
(You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down)
Was it the drugs I take?
(You need to calm it down)
Was it ambitious outbreak?
(You need to calm it down)
Mine is the fury
Mine is the gain
(You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down)
Shall I account for peace?
(You need to calm it down)
Shall I resist it my way?
(You got to calm it down)
Mine is the glory (You got to calm it down)
Mine is the praise (You got to calm it down)
(You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down
Calm it down)
Now that I feel that shame
I've got every reason to persuade (Calm it down)
Mine is the problem (You got to calm it down)
Mine is the pain (You got to calm it down)

[Verse 3 Reprise: Serengeti]
I'm on my own two feet
But I'm not standing upright
Mine is the pressure
Mine is the pain
Was it the drugs I take?
Was it ambitious outbreak?
Mine is the fury
Mine is the gain
Shall I account for peace?
Shall I resist it my way?
Minus the glory
Minus the praise
Now that I feel the shame
I've got every reason to persuade
Mine is the problem
Mine is the pain
