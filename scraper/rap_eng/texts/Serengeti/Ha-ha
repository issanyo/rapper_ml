She mixed paint at Menards
I'm staying at my pop's like I was a palace guard
But I'm not Metety and
It's embarrassing moving home
Sitting around like a gnome stuck inside a poem

[Hook]
It was wintertime
It was wintertime
I heard it on the news

She used to mix paints at Lowe's
We were buying stoves for Eunice, pop shoulda sold
The market's cold, the value of paper gold
As she mixed paint she asks why I look old
Told her I rap, but let me explain something
Disputes over fishing rights and where you came from
Disappointing son-and-pops matching color spools
She had a missing name tag and worked machine tools

[Hook]

Over the next few weeks we were at Menards to buy doors
Cleaning materials to clean stains off floors
We also bought hinges and shit for the rental business
Like door knobs and heavy-duty security fences
She fixed the tag: L-I-E-U
She said her parents were great but had a lot of things to do
I started jogging and picked up my energy a bit
I ran into Lieu outside having a smoke or two
We became friends, she helped me get over rap
She taught me how to mix paint and make the perfect black
She helped me organize and helped me and father's guy
She mixed at paint at Menards, I was a palace guard

[Hook x2]
