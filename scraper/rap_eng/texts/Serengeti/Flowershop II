[Verse 1]
[?]
That’s another thing I did
When I lived above that flower shop
And I got a tattoo of a black giraffe
With purple spots
At the basement speakeasy
Taking blue and yellow jello shots
Country to country
Cheeky monkey with a gold watch
Foreign hip hop spots
Wearing shirts and [?]
I’m nice when the mic’s on
I’m nice with a head nod
Left all that chowder shit
[?]
You know what I mean?

[Verse 2]
She said slow
While we ordered our third bottle
Before we danced by the clear lagoon
In the beginning of June
And we hugged and kissed fuzzy
Slipped our shoes off and drank bubbly
Talk snuggly compliments
In the swinging chair
In the starry air
We ended up sleeping on a futon
The brass fan almost kept us cool
We were [?] in the pool
After sweaty cool times and giggles
Sliced pickles
And [?] tickles
