Like fat women do Pilates
And always talking that they've noticed
These fabulous changes to their bodies
HAHAHA- jokes!
The only way you lose weight:
If you start to smoke coke

Cause I be at them mix parties
Where wifes have face jobs
And husbands drive Maseratis
And kids say to their mommies:
"Ugh! I'm so bored
I don't wanna go skiing"

The fabulous North Shore:
When trains come through
Conductor says "ALL ABOARD!"
And the kids go to Yale
And daddy takes the whole family
To the lake
So they can sail
Come home and have dinner
"OK, Sport! Kiddo!
'Ey you're a winner!"

You don't drop bombs
The only one that does that
Is Dirty Heat and Barry Bonds
I don't know why they love diamonds
The only thing I love is getting cooch
Having fun and rhymin'
But of course I love sports
Went to Sam's house
He didn't have no damn wine corks

It was me, Rod, and Jessie
Said we couldn't stay there no more
We left her pad too messy
It wasn't my fault
I cleaned up my bedroom
In sauteed spaghetti sauce
And it was all on Rod
Constantly smoking weed and
Speeches how he found God

And we was back by the lake;
Jess told me undress
We swam and we formed wakes
Hey Rod, they have (???)
"That's God," I said to him
"Simple and pure"
Wolverine rejuvenation
I read a book about words
And supreme concentration

My rhymes are gettin simple:
Judy Blume wrote Freckle Juice
The kids is in the proofâ€” pimples
(fuck! I fucked up!)
Them rappers need bodyguards
Plus they in competition
To always see who's the most hard

(How many cans of whimsy did you drink, Dave?)
Seven!
I want to make an album so I called up Kevin
Script was fake so I ran it through Jake
And then we made an album
Called "Must we Always Contemplate?"
(What's the answer to that, Dave?)
Not yes
Lifted up her skirt, all I saw was unrest

(How many cans of whimsy did you drink, Dave?
How many cans of whimsy did you drink?)
Seven! All I saw was unrest
Seven! Called up Kevin
(What's the answer to that, Dave?)
Not yes
(What's the answer to that, Dave?)
Not yes
Unrest

Them rappers need bodyguards
Plus they in competition
To always see who's the most hard

I wear big watches
I looked in my bedroom
All I saw were Sasquatches
