[Verse 1]
Yo, the birds chirp softly
The sun shone at my back
Before it was how awfully
Now my mind’s intact
My thoughts form clear
Just happen to be well and alive
What a deal
Breathing was merely meant to help me revive

[Hook]
Oh happy day when the streets are calling me home
It’s going my way
Never have to be alone
The flowers never bloomed so brightly
I never felt so Holly Golightly
You better hold on cause this is exciting

[Verse 2]
All at once it makes sense
The music’s stressing out
I hardly remember when the world’s cold and left out
Open my eyes to take it all in
And shout what I’m feeling
I can’t help this, I’m not trying to be revealing

[Hook]
Oh happy day when the streets are calling me home
It’s going my way
I never have to be alone
The flowers never bloomed so brightly
Never felt so Holly Golightly
You better hold on cause this is exciting

[Verse 3]
Why don’t we get lost and have a few laughs?
Lay out like the universe
And [?] in the earth’s [?]
Eat fruit, we [?]
Every day the same loop
With this flavour troop
The sand and the water fit
Birds chirp soft loop
Slow river move [?]
Holly Go, lightly flow
Things ain’t never so and so
Bright things, pipe dreams
We chill between wooden tears
Yes we did our thing in here
We lay like in the stratosphere
As the water cascades down the rocks
And the poets [?] peer at the birds
[?]
Moves, the groove to the city’s moon
And the far groves
And the river flows
Though it hold on to the swans of the new songs
And the breeze and the bees
The blue skies with the wild fly
Tie together our lives
[?]
I think you need to peep this

[Verse 4: Hi-Fidel]
Nature man, this is natural to me
So I travel in patterns bilateral
Of course when the problems in the world’s too great
Slowly my astral becomes more adaptable to hate
It’s practical to escape but
Ninety per cent of my life
Has been attracted to [?]
I face opposition when I state my position
From a standard position
And you wouldn’t believe
[?] the waters deep
When the fleet’s under seige
Quite difficult to breathe at times
I feel fatigued
[?]
Off the shores of Belize
People bleed
Never [?] the course
Stay forever riding radar spot
And roam four continents and didn’t stop it
Saw the pistol spark
And I never know who shot it
And human life is short
Remember why you got it
It’s a plot against the people
Stand up for human rights
Got the end of the [?] beside you
And [?] unite
These troubled times
Double the amount of positivity
And shock the world
With that inner electricity
What a beautiful day in the city

[Outro]
It’s a sign of the times
Crime after crime
[?] like the blind being led by the blind
So I live it in the turmoil
Till the day that I die
Return home to stand with God on firm soil
[?] sometimes bogus but still
It’s my refuge
Lounging with my sisters, my nieces and nephews
Top of the world
Sears Tower on a clear day is the best view
