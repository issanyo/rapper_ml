[Intro]
[?]
I’m half-life like [?] of carbon
Okay god I’m starving
I kick that tortoise shell
And oracle bone language
[?]

[Verse 1]
[?]
Walk around like [?]
Right left like drama
Rock a [?] coat and speak Yiddish
Decipher Mayan codes
[?]
Style precedent
So she greeted me
A kiss like [?]
Extraordinary rap experiment
That don’t need no combo
Write my shit in the Congo
Give birth like seahorses
Collect fine rums and only ride in Porsches
So now without the diamond
Now she acts as plaything
Now she’s smile and greeting
Everyone with her pinky

[Hook]
I’ll be Bruce Lee and you be Chuck Norris
Together we can move to Rome
And write a rap chorus
About the times
Diplomacy with China and these rhymes
[?]

[Verse 2]
In fact, I, I want to be like Clemente
On my way to Nicaragua
So I can sleep with the ladies that live in the jungle
I’m rough and tumble
Like don’t got yourself together
Like Ryan Court sitting on the porch
Smoking blunts and cigarettes
Is that a great time or what?
What, it’s like everybody sucks
The big game is like a billion bucks
Woah, could you imagine all the fanfare?
Platinum straws, gold drawers
Make the world pause

[Hook]
I’ll be Bruce Lee and you be Chuck Norris
Together we can move to Rome
And write a rap chorus
About the times
Diplomacy with China and these rhymes
Close the blinds and stay in or go outside
Smoke, walk the atolls of history
Black suspenders breaking shackles in the black hole
With long legged kicks
Spritz perfume and backflips
[?]

[Verse 3]
In the basement writing raps about intense [?]
In the rain seeing cats with beautiful [?]
Think why me, I wanna be on TV
Instead of lonely
With a whole bunch of unlocked potential
Monumental flavour
I should have been a baker
How bout a plumber?
The midsummer’s night’s [?]
A lot of dope
A lot of junkies ain’t broke
I pay taxes so people can smoke coke
And fix [?] that always break
All my friends are flakes
Illinois’s the state
Hello [?]
Obsessed like [?]
Oooh la la ley
Fresh raps all day
Yo, peace to the [?]
Being busy taking it easy
And they be like ‘what is he?’
I say shit being gritty
My committee do the entire city
We totally [?] and terribly shitty
Extraordinarily witty
Drinking [?]
Magnifier like a disco [?]
Flip this script
So we can drink juice and gin in it
This is it
[?]
Magnifier like a disco [?]
Flip this script
So we can drink juice and gin in it
This is it
[?]

[Hook]
I’ll be Bruce Lee and you be Chuck Norris
Together we can move to Rome
And write a rap chorus
About the times
Diplomacy with China and these rhymes
