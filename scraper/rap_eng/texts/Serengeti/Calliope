If I woulda just joined the army
Got married at 18
A recruiter coulda been my best man
I'll meet my dad again
Believe in God and go to church
Listen to the radios
Believe in leaders
A little army housing
My emotional farewell
I'm so proud of him, that's my son
For my country
For my love

Devoted parents smashin' friends
To self-assign sheepish grins
An entourage of coupled host
A haloed life on bows of boats
Spring to mind when what is said
The wonderful or the walking dead
The warm aligned on raisin toast
The haloed life on bows of boats
Summertime in Honey Oaks
Every single sown oat
Was it done or was it halt?
Fluttering eyes no trouble sleep
Perfect whiskey served neat
The slightly swang heavy death
Secure the sounds and locust shades
God country and family brave
Adult angst is just a myth
Picnic for Granny Smith
No breach of trust with ill intent
And disappointed sentiments

Save it!
Save it!
The kings and gods
Are dead
Well who'd they kill?
Tomorrow
There'll be the same
Amounts to something
I think it does
They're blue dicks
A block of ice
Box of wine
[?]

Shit!
Yo, since I never joined the army life's been such a sticky mess
Yellow plants in messy rooms
Bawlin' Junes and broken lamps
Oven fumes, restless nights and unread books
Boxes packed in corner stacks
Home is where the heart is whack
And stressed and yellin' angry languages
Fighting, screaming, kicking, broken doors
And landlord tells the tenant's belief to keep it down
Always tryin' to leave this town
Fuck and fuck and fuck I done
One for the order of the beats
An application was shunned twice
Satan shit, side of God
Walk into the dead end gig instead of
I shoulda never will obtain
Shovin' coal into the furnace flame
Fuck I shoulda joined the army
Or at least more so will
Call me some niggers who murder us
Who never take care of business
Keep you a fuckin' idiot
Buyin' Reeboks and Sprite
Every day is hustlin' crack past hustlin'
Coal shovel furnace flame
That's my motherfuckin' name
Bubblegum and good tans
And shit covered in dog dancin'
Fuck shoulda joined the Army
Or at least the Navy, the Coast Guard, or somethin'
Fuck, covered in Cognac
Accurates puppetmaster clean my face, man
Savage apes covered in your mistakes, broken plates
And broken doored house
Landlord tells the tenant the shit must stop
It has to stop!
It has to stop!
