[Verse 1: Serengeti]
This
Right
Here
Is the tale of Banks & Conley
The two greatest outlaws America's ever seen
They tied the ropes, down they went
And all they found were sheets in the wind
(Aw, they were blowing)
On the 20th floor, smack downtown
They changed their clothes from white to brown
Caught a cab, and headed south
Way out to Conley's grandma's house
The trail was hot
"You can't stay," Granny turned them both away
They split up, separate ways
Been on the lam about 10 days
They busted out, love in the air
We're all in search of the lion's share

[Pre-Hook: Serengeti & Sufjan Stevens]
We're all in search of the lion's share
Give me the lion's share
We're all in search of the lion's share
Give me the lion's share

[Hook: Serengeti & Sufjan Stevens]
(Dance, dance)
Put the money in your pants
(Run, run)
We can all get some
(Dance, dance)
Put the money in your pants
(Run, run)
We can all get some
Give me the lion's share
(Dance, dance)
Put the money in your pants
(Run, run)
We can all get some
(Dance, dance)
Give me the lion's share
Put the money in your pants
(Run, run)
We can all get some
(Dance, dance)
Put the money in your pants
(Run, run)
We can all get some
(Dance, dance)
Put the money in your pants
(Run, run)
We can all get some

[Verse 2: Serengeti & Sufjan Stevens]
This
Right
Here
Is the the tale of Banks & Conley
The two greatest outlaws America's ever seen
They tied the sheets, smack downtown
Jails can't hold these fellas down
Banks had the loot stashed in the safe
In a backyard in the Buckeye State
He picked and picked
Moon lights the air
Work that back for the lion's share
Give me the lion's share
Work that back for the lion's share
Give me the lion's share
Work that back for the lion's share
Work that back for the lion's share
They both got lost, love in the air
We're all in search of the lion's share
We're all in search of the lion's share
So work that back for the lion's share
Give me the lion's share
Give me the lion's share

[Hook: Serengeti & Sufjan Stevens]
(Dance, dance)
Put the money in your pants
(Run, run)
We can all get some
(Dance, dance)
Put the money in your pants
(Run, run)
We can all get some
Give me the lion's share
(Dance, dance)
Put the money in your pants
(Run, run)
We can all get some
(Dance, dance)
Give me the lion's share
Put the money in your pants
(Run, run)
We can all get some

[Verse 3: Serengeti & Sufjan Stevens]
So work that back for the lion's share
Work that back for the lion's share
So work that back for the lion's share
Give me the lion's share
Work that back for the lion's share
Work that back for the lion's share
Give me the lion's share
Work that back for the lion's share
Work that back for the lion's share
Work that back for the lion's share (woo)
Get the loot, call for Conley
Lovers live in this economy
Let's all get lost, love in the air
We're all in search of the lion's share
Give me the lion's share
We're all in search of the lion's share
Give me the lion's share

[Outro: Serengeti & Sufjan Stevens]
Yo, dance, dance
(Put the booty in your pants)
Yo, run, run
(We can all get some)
Yo, dance, dance
(Put the booty in your pants)
Run, run
(We can all get some)
Give me the lion's share
Dance, dance
(Put the booty in your pants)
Run, run

Give me the lion's share
Dance, dance

Run, run
(We can all get some)
Dance, dance
(Put the booty in your pants)
Run, run

Dance, dance

All get some, all get some
