[Chorus: Skyler Stonestreet and Serengeti]
I will never call you back
So I wouldn't hold your breath
But I think that you're a good guy
There will always be a goodbye
Maybe I'll see you round
Maybe I won't
But I think that you're a good guy
(So you don't have to say goodbye)

[Verse 1]
I see lovers in love, speaking in sign language
Scurry to the crib cause they be bangin'
And I'm hanging but not a vagrant
Beard on my face cause I go through changes
I thought it would be contagious
Look it's been love all through the ages
How come I can't even say shit?
Can't tell why I even say this?
Can it just be basic? Face it
Faces, hard embraces
Lovers in love fixing up they places
Patience they say, it ain't races
Left behind they pick up the paces
When I look at you all I see is aces
Please babydoll don't make me chase you
Please babydoll I need something to stay true

[Chorus: Skyler Stonestreet and Serengeti]
I will never call you back
So I wouldn't hold your breath
But I think that you're a good guy
There will always be a goodbye
Maybe I'll see you round
Maybe I won't
But I think that you're a good guy
(So you don't have to say goodbye)

[Hook: Skyler Stonestreet and Serengeti]
Oh oh oh oh Hey x2
But I think that you're a good guy
(I hate saying goodbye)

[Verse 2]
I see lovers in love going to a concert
Scurry to the crib cause they 'bout to get work
Take off they shirt, live and direct
Please don't make me stay for the whole set
Beard on my face don't want the raincheck
My life's been shit back, I'm sound and complex
Asked me to change and I'm feeling: reflect that
Go for pizza, maybe a pita
Margarita, bought you a cat look like a cheetah
If you smoke weed then I'll get you reefer
Just want to meet you
Pizza pizza, feed your cheetah
See you're cheap but I'm a believer
Buy you Tivas, go to Ibiza
Maybe St. Lucia maybe St. Riza(?)
See "momma mia"
Have some sangrias

[Interlude: Skyler Stonestreet]
Love is just a crazy kind of motion
Never ending tale oh I suppose
That it's sometimes worth all the commotion
I'll get it right next time I promise (get it right next time)
Love is just a crazy kind of feeling
I know the water's warm but it feels cold
And everybody says that this gets easier
But that gets old

[Chorus: Skyler Stonestreet and Serengeti]
(Yeah)
I will never call you back
(uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh)
So I wouldn't hold your breath
But I think that you're a good guy
(I'm a good guy, good)
There will always be a goodbye
Maybe I'll see you round
(uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh)
(A nice day, a beautiful day we'll have it)
Maybe I won't
But I think that you're a good guy
(So you don't have to say goodbye)

[Hook: Skyler Stonestreet and Serengeti]
Oh oh oh oh hey! x2
But I think that you're a good guy
(I hate saying goodbye)
Oh oh oh oh hey! x2
(Then why does it have to be a goodbye?)
But I think that you're a good guy
(Just give me one try)
