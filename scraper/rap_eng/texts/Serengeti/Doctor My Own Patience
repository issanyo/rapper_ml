[Hook/Chorus]
Open up, open open wide
It’s true I’ve been too anxious
Doctor my own patience

Open up, open open wide
It’s true I’ve been too anxious
Doctor my own patience

[Verse 1]
On the floor fell asleep by the statues
By the feet of our crumbling lores
On the floor by the crumbs of the caches
Will these statues last anymore
Thank you king what fun we have and
And newly crowned on our behalf, and
I will eat more slow so
I will feel more full, yeah

[Hook/Chorus]
Open up, open open wide
It’s true I’ve been too anxious
Doctor my own patience

Open up, open open wide
It’s true I’ve been too anxious
Doctor my own patience

[Verse 2]
Last night had our lunch on the terrace
Sipping wine both feet on the floor
Last night by the crumbs of the caches
Statues playing line with our lore
Thank you king, what fun we have and
Newly crowned on our behalf and
I will eat more slow so
I will feel more full, yeah

[Hook/Chorus]
Open up, open open wide
It’s true I’ve been too anxious
Doctored my own patience

Open up, open open wide
It’s true I’ve been too anxious
Doctor my own patience

[Ad-lib]
On the floor with our feet by the statues
By the feet of the crumbling caches

[Hook/Chorus]
Open up, open open wide
It’s true I’ve been too anxious
Doctor my own patience

Open up, open open wide
It’s true I’ve been too anxious
Doctor my own patience
