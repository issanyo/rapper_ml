[Verse 1]
New [?] from the third dimension
Write raps like a life extension
All the things that I feel I mention
It’s sorta cool
Like drinks up in the whirlpool
Bikini bottom tops
[?]
So we can flip the image
On point with some major spinnage
On point, I take rappers spinning
Add relish, minus the jealous
Minus the hellish ghouls
Who assume prehistoric views
Iron it
I beat box in lion pits
With margarita mix
[?]
Yo, I be tweaking this
Ain’t no leeching this
Only heat in this
Like the Serengeti wilderness
Yo Crucial
[?]
If you ain’t feeling this then listen more
We came [?]

[Verse 2]
My mind spin like I throw discus
Flip rap like US gymnists
You might hear all types of womens
Showing [?] rap style
[?]
Capable to put a crew of freaks at the beach
Like [?]
Rappers fake Norman Bates
Running in place [?] paper plates
I eat you like [?]
A compound, underground
First that hot sound
It’s Serengeti [?] all around town
You bound to the mall
To the block with some girl
I wrote this on the wall of China
In this world
Dirty Flamingo, Dirty Flamingo

[Verse 3]
Around town with some [?]
Dressed sweet like designer dishes
Fine wine sweet as her she kisses
Mad tight like I got stitches
Mad fresh like I found a well
With a billion wishes
Dirty flamingo, dirtiest [?]
Funnest nights and games of bingo
I never lied and blamed it on the [?]
Mad rugged, like [?]
They as vain as [?]
This ain’t no opportunist rap
[?] piranha
This is a new genre
The same era
Smooth as Cadillacs [?]
Smooth [?] pocket mirror
I love rap like Fidel dawg
Madeira
It gets me down like
Drippy tears filled with mascara
