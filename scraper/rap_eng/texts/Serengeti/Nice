Unintelligible man!
Metamorphosis man!
Hey, right now!

[Verse 1: Jel]
Teeth turn to dust
College was a bust
Never owned a car but my feet when I'm in a rush
Huck Finn, no wrath
Cancerous sunbaths
Gotta find a cave to retire with a skin graft
Never earned shit
Lineage never rich
Family tree with no roots
Floating limbs in a swimming dish
When it floods (do the math)
Would've never did drugs
11-years old in the woods my first coke buzz
Rode home on my huffy
Now I'm Evil Knievel (yeah!)
Paradox the son and father
Always trying to hide the evil bottle (that's my shit right there)
----- with draining grotto
Showed him how to bend the box
Blow it pirate new model

[Chorus: Serengeti] (Repeat 2x)
My mic's are even nice
Forget the cable man cuz nice knows how to splice
At nights be watchin Spice
At nights be watchin Spice

Nice... (Repeat 3x)

[Verse 2: Serengeti]
That's it...
In the summer of 2002
Geti formed his own crew
Known as the grown pounds
Known for that down home sound
I've always been around my hometown like Mo Brown
Never had enough but had enough to slow down
(Shit... shit...)
Only a few know how
Like my Uncle Larry and Tony have known to do now
I spit that fashion rap so the ladies get down
A far cry from my new crew in my old hometown
When I used to push the huffy
Geti got lucky
Geti flows ugly, mad gangster like Bugsy
Cocaine and pain meds
Used to be half-dead
Now I feel light and bright just like a moped, yeah

[Chorus] (Repeat 2x)

Nice... (Repeat 2x)
