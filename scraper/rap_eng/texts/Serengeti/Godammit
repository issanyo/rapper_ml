[Verse 1: Serengeti]
She was 17, I was 29
It felt fine, it felt like a great dream of mine
Didn't tell her I was married, didn't have the guts
Didn't want my mistake to mess this shit up
Said I was 24, I didn't want to age no more
I bought an exercise machine and put it on the door
The key to a great body is a solid core
I hide my wallet and cell, in my shoe on the floor

[Hook: Yoni Wolf and (Serengeti)]
Ohh (Goddamit)
Ohh (Goddamit)
Ohh (You wouldn't understand it)
Ohh...Ohh!

[Verse 2: Serengeti]
My birthday dinner, she thought that I was 25
Actually, I was 30 on the inside
I had such a double life that I was going mad
Twenty parallel lives when I met her dad
I bought college books and put 'em in a book bag
Made some shit up, about being post-grad
For 10 years I was married to my wife at home
I'm always out of town and troubles with my cellphone

[Hook: Yoni Wolf and (Serengeti)]
Ohh (Goddamit)
Ohh (Goddamit)
Ohh (You wouldn't understand it)
Ohh...Ohh!

[Verse 3: Serengeti]
It's four years later, she finally made 21
I'm 33, she never seen my ID
We got married, but I never got divorced
I'm back and forth like balls on tennis courts
I'm always tired, my wife thinks I'm 29
My other wife thinks I'm out of town all the time
Three mothers, ten brothers, six sisters
Stressful on Thanksgiving and Christmas

[Hook: Yoni Wolf and (Serengeti)]
Ohh (Goddamit)
Ohh (Goddamit)
Ohh (You wouldn't understand it)
Ohh...Ohh!

Ohh ...Ohh!
Ohh ...Ohh!
Ohh ...Ohh!
Ohh...Ohh!
