[Hook]
I saw a man breaking his vows for the first time
He looked like he was having fun, fun
Finally got to use that one line
It looked like he was having fun, fun

[Verse 1]
The Charleston, and pearls, woman silent on his arm, yep
It was a disco, disco, disco
Take it to the bridge then

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And the Charleston, woman silent on his arm
Beautiful pearls, beautiful pearls
Cross the Rhine
Got to the east
Bonn was a great time, yeah
Dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
[???]

[Outro]
I saw a man breaking his vows for the first time
He looked like he was having fun, fun
Finally got to use that one line
Finally got to cross the Rhine, Rhine
