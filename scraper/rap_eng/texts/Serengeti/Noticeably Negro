[Verse 1]

I like girls with some real nice mountains
And when she walks fast you can suddenly see 'em bouncin'
We can chill around the Buckingham Fountain
Walk over to the yachts and really do some loungin'
Y'know, top of the world, baby, it's a vision
As long as you can cook and keep a real clean kitchen
Don't that sound like some addition?
I'm only speakin' truth baby, like Carl Pickens
Y'know when the king told people listen
Everybody hush up and try to get with it
You could only hear what you wanna hear
What I propose right now is life with no fear
Like a daredevil, you can watch but don't meddle
Get what you want, from trim to precious pebbles
Watch out man, watch out
We're comin' out, yeah

[Chorus]

This is obviously, blatantly, far from mistakenly
Truthfully, vividly, you know lineage history
In other words, noticeably
(What are you?)
Noticeably negro
This is obviously, blatantly, far from mistakenly
Truthfully, vividly, you know lineage history
In other words, noticeably
(What are you, like Puerto Rican or, like, Arab?)
Noticeably negro

[Verse 2]

Shooting ‘round the world with the Airstar crew
Don’t like swimming because I saw that movie Jaws II
The ultimate dream is a place with a lake view
And women in a slip that’s almost see-through
And so much ice that you could build an igloo
And live in it, and have a pleasin’ life too
Alright, boo? Like the comic [?] do
I find truth in the animals like kung fu

Like Ricola, relax and have a cream soda
Reach new heights, and move my ass to Boulder
It ain’t over, it’s a brand new start
Exercise, buddy, and get a healthy heart, man
That’s math, like biking on the Lake Shore Path
Rollerblading women that’s really tryin’ to tighten they ass
Some are hopeless, some need to chill
The last thing you wanna do is overdo the bills

[Chorus]

This is obviously, blatantly, far from mistakenly
Truthfully, vivi-vividly, you know lineage history
Words, noticeably
(What are you?)
Noticeably negro
This is obviously, blatantly, far from mistakenly
Truthfully, vividly, you know lineage history
In other words, noticeably
(Um, what are you, like, um, Chinese?)
Noticeably negro

[Verse 3]

Other last thing is rolling with a fake guild
Ra-rappity-rap-rappers is always talkin’ ‘bout skills
Or other rappers that don’t know the rules
Or havin’ a fucked up gut on the first day of summer school
Like, you seen the new kid?
On the side he’s bald, on the top it looks like a wig
There’s no fade, I believe his name is Wade
I even think I saw him at the gay parade
Yeah, like, if that school’d allow hats
Ten years later you wouldn’t be livin’ in the slums with rats
Y’know, vermin, Freddy said “bitch, where’s the burgers?”
(Where’s the burgers?)
Sometimes I rock a beard, use my scarf as a turban
My favorite pickles are the sweet little Gherkins
Almost every teen boy gets caught jerkin’
Can you say, this is stuff for DNA?
(Mom! Stay out of my room!)

[Chorus]

This is obviously, blatantly, far from mistakenly
Truthfully, vividly, you know lineage history
In other words, noticeably
(What are you?)
Noticeably negro
This is obviously, blatantly, far from mistakenly
Truthfully, vividly, you know lineage history
In other words, noticeably
(Yeah, man, I’m like half-Korean and half-camel
And I’ve got some zebra, and uh, like, a small part reptile, and the rest Native American)
Noticeably negro
