Chillin out, late night watching Critters
Always dreamed of having that beautiful fucking babysitter
But she’d always try to get me to lick Lucy
But I was only 12 and I thought that shit was too spooky
Now I rap man but still watch the Karate kid
Larusso started trends with that crane kick that he did
And painters caps, generic at TJ  Maxx
Get drunk so much that you have a fuckin time lapse
With some indie chick taking pharms on a kick
Same clothes for three days, smokin’ and sniffin’ mad shit
And write about it and sound like you proud about it
Like being at this bar and just like you dreamed about it
Frank Dukes fought Chun-Li
So ill and gutter when I rhyme for free
Girls cooch, nipples, and no fruit
It’s like you exercising or still up when the sun is rising
Rock star, right? Tell that to your dad
He’ll be like, ‘you still state the computer ate a draft’
Now beat it, just like when the time’s right
Or rocking at the Vertigo drunk with a fucked up mic
Hey man, you shouldn’t drink so much
Shut the hell up, or then you it do it duck
Smackin’ asses, huge Jaegermeister glasses
What’s up to the boobs and cooches that passes
Still watching Critters, pill prone throughout the winter
Taking off the I care for you sensor
Sometimes no shower for 6 days member
Party club pretend like we’re playing music thugs
The more deep it gets, the more I’m bout to lose it
Another example of life destroyed for making music
But I was staying up watching Ferris Bueller
Going to the bars trying to see who's khuler
No jobs, cigarettes and dirty gauze
I’m still trying to get my monkey ass back to Prague
But oh well, lookin’ at the jar of change for beers
Thoughts all fucked up like life was a shit smear
Nasty life like on a girl’s panties
Give Geti a grammy and kick it in Miami
I don’t like you, you don’t give a shit about me
Your mind’s beach flip flopped and fucked up feet
Toes so long coulda been on Queen Kong (bong)
Anything you say might end up in these songs
You’re still trying to smoke weed from a broke bong (bong)
Serengeti’s so skinny, but so damn strong
One time I carried this fat chick home from prom
Broken like a penguin’s wing all by myself
The loneliest thing that you ever felt
Shit therefore I swallow pills, therefore the pits more
Nothing to live for, your girls gone on to do more
She's moved on but you’re knocking at the front door
Fuck you, give back my damn cufflinks and my flute
I thought we would get married and I would coach hoops
And you would make cupcakes and have kittens
I’m still sitting here watching the motherfucking Hidden
Chillin out, late night watching Critters
Always dreamed of having that beautiful fucking babysitter
But she’d always try to get me to lick Lucy
But I was only 12 and I thought that shit was too spooky
Now I rap man but still watch the Karate Kid
Larusso started trends with that crane kick that he did
And painters caps, generic at TJ  Maxx
Get drunk so much that you have a fuckin time lapse
With some indie chick taking pharms on a kick
Same clothes for three days, smokin’ and sniffin’ mad shit
