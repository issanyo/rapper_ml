The dryer has been buzzing
Why is my cousin calling?
Why is my Julie bawling?
Tears sitting right here
Lamont he's acting weird
[?] He seems pissed
I make it look good
I make it look good
Joji he's paging me
There's a party in Riverdale
Need to get out of here
I make it look good
Might go to Calumet
Stace just sitting here
Julie she just so upset
Makes me upset
Joji is paging me
Party is in River Forest
Party in South Holland
Dennis is on my lap
Birthday boy yesterday
Suppose to bring home the cake
I was in Blue Island
I make it look good [x3]
Julie she blowing her nose
Tanya won't look at me
In this state close
Curtis standing there
Joji is blowing me up
Party is in Hazel Crest
Party in Oak Forest
Curtis took off his vest
I make it look good [x5]
Told me take off the shades
He took a swing at me
Joji is blowing me up
I make it look good
Party in Riverdale
Dryer, it keeps buzzing
Joji, he picked me up
Then we drove away
Feel like I'm missing out
People have great time
Feel like a great time
Want to have a great time
Feel out of my mind
And I feel unsettled
My best Curtis party
Slapped me like Graig Nettles
Me and Joji
Uh
I'll have a great time
We left Monday night
Thursday at 9
Crush by dessert wine
I'm a little sore the next day but I felt fine

I make it look good
We make it look good
We make it look good
We make it look good
We make it look good
We make it look good
I make it look good
I make it look good

We saw Fridge Perry
Me and Joji [?]
Rock and Roll Micky D's
Are own leather gloves
Are own couple dance
Leather gloves got rips
Hell of a last month
Hell of a last week
Was going go to Morehouse like Papa
And pledge Kappa
Riding with Joji
Shidoshi Senzo Tanaka
That's just the flippy watch
Over 200 times
I might go home but
There all on top of me
Somebody's watching me
Rifle through my stuff
You don't have no right
Midnight moonlight
Joji he borrowed the room
Tanya and Lamont stays
Julie and Maurine and Curtis
I make it look good
They make me feel nervous
I'm dancing in Oak Forest
Huey Lewis this is it
Lady don't know-her-name
We dance more tunes
I'm dancing to English beat
Joji he's having a meeting
It's about 2:20
Fellow taps me on my shoulder
Tells me "take off the shades"
I said "what you say?"
He said "take off the shades"
Salt N Pepa song Shoop
He took a swing at me
I tried the Dim Mak
Joji he's on the phone
Lady's screaming his name
Told you he's on the phone
He took a swing at me
For making it look good
I've never seen [?]
But I'm making look good
Salt N Pepa, Spinderella
We make it look good [x5]

All you need now is a little clarity
All you need now is a little therapy
[x4]

A little clarity
