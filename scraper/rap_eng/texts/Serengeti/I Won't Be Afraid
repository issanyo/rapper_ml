[Sufjan]
I will give it up
I won't be afraid
I won't try too hard
I will touch your back

I'm prepared for death
I will tear my clothes
People try too hard
I won't be afraid of this, does anybody want to?
I will lift my hands
I'm prepared for death
I will tear my clothes
People try too hard
I won't be afraid of this, does anybody want to?
I will lift my hands
I won't be afraid of this, does anybody want to?

I won't try too hard
I will touch your back
I'm prepared for death
I won't be afraid

I will give it up
I won't make a mess
I won't try too hard
I won't be afraid

I won't be afraid (I won't be afraid) [x8]
