[Intro]
I'll wear a false nose for your wedding
I'll bring you bedding as gifts
When you were mine, when you were mine, and I was mine
When I was mine, when I was mine, when you were mine

[Verse 1]
I see you standing, standing there with your husband
I brought you something so you'd sleep with me
I'll hide behind, I'll hide behind, wasn't time
It wasn't time, I hide behind, I hide behind

[Outro]
I'll wear a false nose to your wedding (x3)
I'll bring you something, so you'd sleep with me
I see you standing, standing there with your husband
I'll wear a false nose to your wedding
