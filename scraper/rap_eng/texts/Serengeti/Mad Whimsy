[Verse 1]
I couldn’t even walk right
I already had a broken leg
You still beat me down, I’m on the ground
You stabbed my in my ear
Couldn’t even hear
I’m a alcoholic, you gave me all that beer
I had a cataract, what did you do?
You punched me in my eye
When I said I wanted to die, you said ‘try’
The weed got me high
You didn’t have to put them drugs in it
I was 22, you told me life was all about you
Tipped something in my brew
The you stole all my rings and shoes
Yo, I couldn’t walk right
You still threw me down the stairs
Helped me down, made me curl my hair
I knew you didn’t care
I used to have a flair
Till you gave me all that heroin
Told me I was a walking sinner
That I’m gonna die soon
You had me so depressed
Feeling stressed, like I’m jumping
You had me doing [?]
Fucking telling me I need to search for something
Follow me, be yelling in my ear when I’m deep
Laughing at me from your new jeep
Kick me in the face with cleats
Locked up my two front teeth
Then you said we had no beef
Said we had no beef

[Verse 2]
I couldn’t even stand up
You still hit me with a bottle
Said it’s all hollow
Told me it was all about Jesus
I said I’m prestigious
You said why you acting dirty [?]
And fuck with them chicks
Then you hit me with that metal stick
You laughed at me
Cursed me why I couldn’t fit in
Told me I’ll rise
Knowing that I had a bum knee
You know I had a warrant
And told the cops to run my ID
Told me gangs were good
And then you made me stacking on the G

[Verse 3]
I came here to do the monkey business
The business of monkeys
Peel a banana and I slip off the stage
Like, who out there smokes weed
And where my bitches at?
Decade of rap and we still stuck on that
I’m stuck on whimsy
And this chimney smoking girl with tats
She said when I did my favourite song
That shit was stright wack
I [?]
I got right in her face
And said that honey I’m in love with you
I [?] her friend
I said I’m sorry homie
It must have been the drugs
It must have been the night on drugs
Hey, hops and all that shit
Tell the sound guy turn that shit down
And let everybody leave this place with a frown
[?] Serengeti
[?]
I said give me a round of open bar
I guaranteed I’ll throw up
I guaranteed I won’t show up the next day
Slow up

[Outro]
I got a sail boat
And I’m gonna sail when the world float
World float, world float
The world float, the world float
I got a date tonight
And I’m gonna meet her at the borderline
Borderline, borderline, borderline
I got a track in mind
And I’m gonna rock it on the bass line
Bass line, bass line, the bass
