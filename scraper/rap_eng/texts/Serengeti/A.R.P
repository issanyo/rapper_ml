[Verse 1]

I used to be down and not have a friend
Groundhog Day like this shit don't end
And trying keep up with the latest trends
You say you don't give a damn, but you pretend
Last Saturday I was in Berlin
You can hear my ass rap on 2K10
East L.A be looking all grim
Homegirl had hop she could touch the rim
Strong-ass legs cause she always swim
Took her out to dinner dropped her off at the gym
Waikiki like BJ Penn
You say you really like her but she's with your friend
And, what's . . . chagrin?
Play a sad song like a violin
It's Saturday again
Don't feel bad lift up your chin

[Verse 2]
I felt powerless so I said, "Why me?"
Life got rough like a desert, G
Reinvent yourself like a celebrity
Go to a lot of places, get in for free
We, experienced such glee
Rough fast feet need vitamin G
I skateboarded and hurt my knee
I sat right next to a willow tree
I did DMT
In high school I rapped like a G
My father said, "Son, don't be me."
When I was 21 we shared some tea
We, get along beautifully
I"m from Chicago like Mr. T
Advance Base made the beat A.R.P
I have a few friends in NYC
Oh

Oh

[Verse 3]
I did some strange things but kept it on the low
I'm a rap artist so I'm in the know
Last weekend I tried some blow
Kept fucking with my ears sort of like Van Gogh
Around Here like the Counting Crows
They said, "Turn it down," but I said, "Hell no."
Then she said she had to go
She had to go to work cause she needs that dough
Then I turned on Camp Lo
Then no Bel just Biv DeVoe
Then I stubbed my toe
I wanted to curse but I just yelled, "YO!"
Oh
