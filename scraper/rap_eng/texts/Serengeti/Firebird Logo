Ypu
Alright
Yup

My karate is sick
Not at Gymkata levels
But I could at least break bricks
Or at least break plates
Once I found my whimsy
Was like the savage breaking free from crates
Fresh air and tricycle squeaks
Or removing tags from birthday present khaki pleats
Ah, these are gonna look good
Smooth like a starry night
Chillin' on a jeep hood
Firebird logo
Word to messages
Me and my man Patrick breaking through savage stretches
He just wants to dance
I just want a second chance
Perfect times in Denver
Dinner with Spike Lee
Shanghai is really getting built up
Listening to jazz more
I really need to get a job
Maybe start a veggie fest
This puppet show doesn't pay much
On the fringe and outskirts
