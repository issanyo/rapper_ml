Alright so, it's the day before the Fourth of July in 1997
There was going to be a huge house party [?] girl in my high school
So I decided to drive down to Indiana and get a shitload of fireworks.  Cause you can't have fireworks in Illinois, you gotta go over to Indiana, that's just something we had to do-

[Serengeti as Kenny Dennis]
It ain't legal!

To survive on the Fourth
So I''m coming back on the Dan going northbound going about 80

[Serengeti as Kenny Dennis]
Hey take it easy!

[Anders Holm]
In my Dad's station wagon with witch whistlers, roman candles, black cats. These cone shaped fountain things...
Just asking for it
I look to my right...
(*Siren*)
I'm done for; I can't go to the party, probably going to lose my license, who knows what
I pull over, I'm sweating

[Serengeti as Kenny Dennis]
Take it easy

[Anders Holm (Curtis)]
Dude comes over to my window, taps on it, I roll it down
(License and registration.)
So I'm going through my stuff, getting my wallet out
And he leans in, and I'm like, "What's this dude about?"
(Uh, what you playing in there? What is that there?)
I'm like, "this is my buddy Kenny"
(Turn it up!)
And it was an unreleased EP he did with Tha Grimm Teachaz called "Da End iz Near"
Nobody had it
And the cop goes
"Kenny fuckin' Dennis?"
And that was when I met Curtis
(Uh, go ahead. Take it easy on the streets. These streets ain't nothin' to play with.)
