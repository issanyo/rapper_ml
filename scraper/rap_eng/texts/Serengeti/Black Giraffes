[Verse]
It’s like [?] to the king of ballet
I wore [?] buttons
With a striped shirt with a rose
On the train snoring
Dreaming of balloon rides
And giant daisies
Giant gate keys to parties with themes
I was dressed as Matt Murdock
I had a whip
We’d skinny dip
On the properties [?]
Listen to them songs from the 80s
When it was money and drug crazy
Cartoons, a hundred blue balloons
Filled the damn room
“Oh baby” was all I heard
The smell of grass could [?]
I’m on the train and that’s my word
It’s the dream
When I’m in Paris
Wearing [?] buttons
And goofy stripes
[?]
About the time I lived above a flower shop
And I could open up my window
When it rained and smell the roses
Taking double decker bus trips
With ex-patriot chicks
With perfume spritz
They got kicks
They had glowing friendships
Bags of laughs
We called ourselves the Black Giraffes
Group on tour to make the planet more pure
We stay in unison in the heat of the moment
With our hands in the middle
Like [?] do
[?] walking down [?]
The stars light the whole globe
It’s chilly but it’s not cold
I’m [?] but it’s not so
Fountains, stone benches
Violet coloured lenses
It’s not pretentious
We travel by the billion inches
From [?] the holy land
To fifty crown bets on blackjack hands
We travelled the whole span

[Hook]
Boats in Venice
Steins of Guinness
Totally bliss
[?]

[Outro]
It’s DJ Crucial
Dirty Flamingo style
Serengeti
F5 Records
Came to bring the ruckus
