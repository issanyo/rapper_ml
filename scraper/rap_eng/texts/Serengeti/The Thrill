[Verse]
Every day I’m sorta making history
Eyes on the prize having breakfast at Tiffany’s
That’s winning, I’m feeling like a new beginning
Sunrise, sun up, top of the first inning
So let’s go, headline then hit the aftershow
Have a great time
Free your mind just like a buffalo
Legendary, so you can crown me with a cherry
Made it straight to the top
Twelve o’clock, lollipop
Get loose, tonight there was no excuse
Gonna have a party
Kick a rhyme like Dr. Goose
Blowing up, sip from the teacup
Eyes on the prize so everybody can see us
Like a star, expensive like caviar
Return of the champion
It doesn’t matter who you are
So have fun, make it pop like bubblegum
Told you I would never stop
To the top, number one
Everybody, it’s like I’m truly making history
Feeling on point, harmonise like a symphony
Wind at my back
Stronger than a lumberjack
Forecast sunny like I’m flipping through the almanac
We won, celebrate and we just begun
Have another party and reinvite everyone
Legendary, never stop, it’s temporary
Rise to the top, fresh start like January

[Hook]
Get it while the getting’s good
Riding in the limousine
Bout to celebrate
Like tonight you’re turning seventeen
Like tonight you’re turning seventeen
Get it while the getting’s good
Riding in the limousine
Bout to celebrate
Like tonight you’re turning seventeen
