Okay yo, (listen)

[KDz:]
We teach, (You listen)
Class is in session
A lot of MCs need a new profession
Cause they ain't b-boy, no siree bob
Have you all confused like a kid at a new job
KDz gets mad skins, sisters, and nieces
Fuck with the Teachaz, your crew is in pieces
Like the whole shirt, MCs get reworked
You take shorts, take out your cohorts
So much weed burning into the Marley
I don't like house, but peeps the mastafali(?)
And Son Doobie, DJ Khoufie
The teacher's in the building and you must salute me
Now Mr. Roper, Lee Iaccoca
Break into your crib and steal your sofa
Nowhere to sit down, take your freaks to
We got 40s, cold for the whole crew
Get the bozack, I rock Kojak
Call me on the horn, 'can I have my Glock back?'
No, no, no, cause I caught you slipping
When we eat, there'll be no tipping
We get so bent, no (?)
Do what I want to do like the U.S. government
I got my own thing, rock like Sing Sing
Fuck Phil Collins, get a taste of the real thing

[PMDF:]
I hope your decent
Cause I'm'a rip your clothes to shreds
And the flesh underneath it
Take a shit on your (?)
Pull out your brain and eat it
After lightly toasting some bread
And adding a nice savory spread to it
I'll call (?)
Your wife will be giving me head through it
Through the entire ordeal
But to me it's just a meal
Even the dead do it
And that's word to the big red druid zombie that lives right here
In my frontal lobe where yours was

Prior to the incisions of vision of your melon
Before I made s'mores with your cerebellum
Try to find out
And steadily I'm verily getting started
This is not for the faint of heart

As an icee in the pencil stump(?)
Prince Midnight Dark Force who not(?)
So cop a squat, pull up a cot
You're next, it doesn't have to involve sex
It's me lo een guessing(?)
Don't eat pork, but I love human being
If you fly like a stork, or vanish from the scene
For your looks, look I'm not that mean
And cannibalism really isn't my thing

[KDz:]
What up PM, that's what I'm talking about
Straight gobbling, and gobbling houses

[PMDF:]
Gobbling MCs is what I do son
I do, that's what I do
Rrrip, Yaaah!
