[Verse 1]
Golly she's beautiful
This pmdd commercial
The life I wanted so badly
Painting barefoot and hugs
She didn't smoke, or remind me of false hope
She was barely under thirty
Pmdd commercial
Independent
"How did I get here?"
I wondered laying in bed, in bed all day
Over thirty, false hopes
Things don't magically appear, they stay the same

[Chorus]
Pmdd makes her ill
I pick up her precious pills
With money from my own job

[Verse 2]
This pmdd commercial comes on all the time
I've been bed ridden for too much of the new year
I don't know why I am, I mean I can move and all
I guess the weight of everything, everything I want looms
Damn it's so heavy, I don't bother moving
My odometer's low
This pmdd commercial, it's on all the time
Fuzzy smile, I pick up her medicine at the pharmacy

[Chorus]
