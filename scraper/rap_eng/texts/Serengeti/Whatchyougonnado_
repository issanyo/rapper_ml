Peace God
Hold up God
In order to get to justice, we got to start with knowledge and wisdom
Follow that with understanding
We got to trick knowledge
You know what I'm saying?
In this world of illusions, causing confusion
I always keep my ciphers nearby, you understand what I'm saying

Please believe God, I got a watch full of 7s, that's twelve 7s
Multiply that it's 84, add one that's 85
85 percent is trying to take what we own
You understand?
Well please believe, when the time comes, where you going to be?
Hah. Whutchyougonnado?
Peace God

[KDz:]
Word to the sun, moon and stars
I never let them take me without a fight
(??) I be some rhymes
I'm'a shine like the sun
And keep my hand on a lyrical weapon
And if a punk steps he'll get gunned
Shoot, pow, put his brains all over the floor
I'm ready for war, and here to settle the score
I'm breaking down metal doors, bringing terror to your area
If you want to be down, hey, the more the merrier
Rhyming is like a pack of bloodthirsty pit bull terriers
Are you scared? Yeah, it gets scarier
Shoot, we got (???)
Man the (?) like an aircraft carrier
(??)
And find a way like a student in a demonstration
So if you going to test the champion's resolve
Here's a tip, don't get involved

Whutchyougonnado when they come for you
Whutchyougonnado
Whutchyougonnado
Whutchyougonnado when they come for you
Whutchyougonna--
Whutchyougonna--
Wutchyougonnado

[PMDF:]
(??)
Don't worry me
(??)
Boutros Boutros
No Red Baron
(??)
A lot of MCs need a crying shoulder
Ford Fairlane was American Ninja
Pump up the volume, you get linda
Czechoslovakia, call me Raymond
(??)
Some MCs like to pick their last breath
(??)
In Topeka
Reactor!

Whutchyougonnado when they come for you

What you gonna do when your efforts fail?
(I'm gonna go to jail!)
What you gonna do when you get out of jail?
(I'm gonna raise some hell!)

Prison in a mental escape
Of a mental's create
A force field around me to nullify the hate
That surrounds me
That would be greater than Alexander the Great
Crush you salamanders he's holding a holy (??)
Wild in the jungle
So if you not a lion I suggest you not rumble
One small bumble can make your fall crumble
So I give you this option: Abort, humble

[KDz:]
I'm off with your head like Salman Rushdie
You stay broke like Euro Disney
We get busy, Paris and London
Duel with the Teachaz
Left in Reno
You smoke doobie(?) like Lee Trevino
Back of the pack getting jacked
Step up, you get pushed back
On the attack
Lock and loaded
(???)
Like Kevin Costner

Whutchyougonnado when they come for you
Whutchyougonnado
Whutchyougonnado
Whutchyougonnado when they come for you
Whutchyougonna--

Wutchyougonnado

What you gonna do, MCs?
You're in a duel with Tha Grimm Teachaz
The PMDF, and KDz

Pull some!

What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
Huh?
