[Verse 1: Serengeti]
That not being big shit and not lovin' obscurity
Keep it real in rap, don't mess with maturity
People get older, mountain boulders
When ridin' the ropes starts to mess with your back and shoulder
Keep on with the keep on, keep on
Keep on
Shitty shit to sleep on
Thorny vines and glasses
To buy us time
Lines lost luster
Feeling like a buster
Few days pass by, start to regain the luster
It just keeps up and down
Like everything
Face facts
Don't get too excited, and don't get a heart attack

[Hook: Sicker Man]
Day By day
No matter where you are
I will be a heartbeat
Away from you

[Serengeti]
And not being big shit, and not lovin' obscurity
Keep it real in rap don't mess with maturity
People get older, mountain boulders
When ridin' the ropes and starts to mess with your back and shoulder
Keep on with the keep on, keep on, keep on
Shitty shit to sleep on
Thorny vines and glasses
To buy us time
Lines lost luster
Feeling like a buster
Few days pass by start to regain the luster
It just keeps up and down
Like everything, face facts
Don't get a heart attack jack
Appreciate when the luster's back
Notice when it's gone and deal
Different sides like the colors of the wheel
[mumbling] (Boom, boom...)

[Outro: Sicker Man]
...Always
It's cool, it's fine
It's great, it's good, it's great
It's great, it's great, it's fine, it's fine
It's perfect, it's great
[?]
It's sad, a drag
Tonight, today
Good
Happy
It's cool it's perfect
It's fine
It's fine
It's cool
It's great
It's great
It is...
It is...
