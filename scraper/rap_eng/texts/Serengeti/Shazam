[Hook]
Shazaam shazaam
Shaq don't want none
Shazaam shazaam
Shaq don't want none
Shazaam shazaam
Shaq don't want none
Jolly green giants get cut

Don't ever step to the Killer Deacon
Talkin 'bout the 'stache look silly
Why are you speaking
You're not thinking
Don't you know that I'm a teacher
Bypass your viper
Steal your car speakers
I'll hustle ya
I'll bludge ya
I'll muscle ya
I'll scuffle ya
You're sleeping
You must not be up
Snoring, counting sheep
Snooze and start beef
You got the D's on the mission
No relief chief
Save the nine
I'm the king of the pride
You too soft, the Teachaz
We hoop outside
As far as acting go
I'm Marlon Brando
Don't make the D's say what's up in Orlando

[Hook]

All you got is a penny
I got the PM
Your nickname is fu?
Mine's is the Deacon
You know what that means
Let's just compare teams
The evidence
You'll get creamed
Teachaz vs. the Magic
That's not a real thing
Abra kadabra
The hooper
The rapper
The actor
You after?
David make Goliath bow down to the master
You got no handles
You double dribble
You too sweet like a lollipopsicle
We a militia
You fun and tickles
You a slingshot
KDz is a missile

[Hook]
