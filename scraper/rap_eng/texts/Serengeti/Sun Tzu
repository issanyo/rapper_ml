[Verse 1]
[?]
Want me to rap
How about the art of escaping traps
[?]
And now protected by [?]
And rhino skins
And biggest brontosaurus burgers
With fifteen feather arrows
I live in the trees amongst [?] and sparrows
Lost my head
I need ten pills to go to bed
And walk around saying operation code red
I’m sorta square like a Chinese city
I break things from [?]
Long, skinny, goofy, everything
Guaranteed [?]
To getting high and drinking
When I was locked up, what were you thinking?
Wasn’t raised in church, more like a bird perch
All gritty and dirty like [?]
Keep that dumb smirk
Grow a beard like Papa Smurf
[?]
There’s diamonds in the turf
Let’s make it work

[Hook]
This victorious situation
The product of creative imagination
However brilliantly conducted
Like whatever
Sun Tzu said
Weapons are [?]

[Verse 2]
[?]
Sore like a condor
Close windows and doors
They had me like Spacey
Impossible to chase me
I’m impossible to face
In an overall rap race
I’m in a rat race with no motive
You capitalise with [?]
It was my only focus
You know I’m hopeless
Rock a cloak like [?]
Minus the magic
Like Tony Starks
I had an incredible terrible, yo
[?]
Red wine lips and curved hips
I’m all [?] baby
I need your clutch more than ever
Outcast, yeah, discarded letter
I feel like Baretta
With no [?] no glory
And no movie-tight story
Don’t bore me with your self appraisal
[?]
Had me all talking goofy
Had me looped out and spaced [?] out
[?]
I got shot with a crossbow

[Hook]
This victorious situation
The product of creative imagination
However brilliantly conducted

[Verse 3]
The devil’s not that terrific
I’d rather stay outside and picket
They have to deal with that shit
I have to put up with your B.S
So phoney like I had to be in the class war
Instead of fronting like you’re humble
When everybody’s clapping
You acting bastards
Big snobs and big jerks
Surrounded by big snobs
That had that follow along smirk
Funny looking guy with a sense of approval
By the others
[?] could play the role of [?]
I prefer to watch tennis
If you wanna stay alive
Just say good to meet you
And what do you do for a living?
And be see through
And never ask some shit like
What I’m supposed to be through
And go along, sing along

[Hook]
This victorious situation
The product of creative imagination
However brilliantly conducted
Like whatever
