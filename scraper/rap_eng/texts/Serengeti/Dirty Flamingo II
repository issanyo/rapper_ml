[Intro - Bits N Pieces]
Wait, where is this?
Wait
Ah, okay, here it is, yeah

[Verse 1 - Bits N Pieces]
Yo, chicks are
They can seem so real
Like it was Pixar animation
They can be the strings upon your guitar
Get hard, get in, withdraw
Woke up and don’t remember her name
I met her at this bar, and got this far
[?]
Angry but can’t blame it on the liquor
She wakes and sees a stranger
Nurses her jaw as if it’s sore
Then this broad quickly grabs her [?]
And blows a kiss and says
‘This is for all the niggas who think with they dick’

[Verse 2 - Bits N Pieces]
Headaches and all
Like we’s acquainted
Sobered up like ‘who the fuck was that bitch’?
And just fainted
I danced with her
Fragrance was tight
Met her tonight
We at the bar
I’m like ‘tonight’
She like ‘yeah’
I’m like ‘aight’
And then boom boom boom
Her real name, I can’t recall it
Angelica, Angela, [?]
Just a dirty flamingo
A go home chick
The type of chick that if you’re faded
You may go home with
So drink politely and lightly
Going through it [?]
Somebody else wifey might be maybe most likely
[?] searching for niggas to do
A dirty flamingo coming to a bar near you
And it’s true

[Outro - Bits N Pieces]
Ah shit, tell me I didn’t just do that shit
Tell me I didn’t just do that shit
Fuck
Suck it up, move on
Yeah, peace to my man Levi
[?]
Jerry G, Hi-Fidel, Bits N Pieces
This is like this, it’s like that
Yeah, peace to Scraps
Committee
It’s just like this and like that
Yeah, peace to, uh, the galaxy
We own the galaxy, F5
Peace to Serengeti
[?] like this y’all
