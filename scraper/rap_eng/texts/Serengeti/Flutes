[Verse 1: Serengeti]
Hey, Geti King
Spaghetti string snipped- boob fell out of it;
Excuse me, ma’am, I see your ham
I hope the gods don’t curse me, damn
I like it like I found a bike
The prettiest thing I seen tonight
Prettiest thing I saw in years
Including ghosts and volunteers
They couch surfed and loved dessert
Order sweet and gather skirts
Even prettier than them
Prettier than a precious gem
Pretty as an onion stem
Or weekends at the MGM
I can’t see why your strap is snipped
I’m not complaining, not a bit
I’m not
I’m not

[Verse 2: Serengeti]
King Floyd attacked and destroyed a convoy
That was carrying LaCroix and also little kid’s toys
I made a mistake;
I also poisoned an artificial lake
It wasn’t my best moment
So at night the king lies awake
Floyd-
My father’s middle name too
I hated it growing up
So I said my second name was Lou
There’s pressure having a realm in my old forest of Elm
Plus when you make a mistake you felt overwhelmed
I was feeling sorta sick
My excuse: I made a mess of it
I’m not complaining, not a bit
I’m not complaining, not a bit
I’m not
I’m not
I’m not
I’m not complaining, not a bit
I’m not complaining, not a bit
I’m not
