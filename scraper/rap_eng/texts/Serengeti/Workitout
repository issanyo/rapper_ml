[Verse 1]
Aye aye, Captain, smooth sails ahead
On top like a bunk bed
Clear skies overhead
Paint the whole town red
Paint like Picasso
Do it again, bravo
Today, not tomorrow
The world at our fingertips
Tastes good and finger lips
So many trends
Colorful like a comic strip
[?], icons, adventures like a rom-com
So many things, let's celebrate
Yo, let’s get it on
On top, let’s go
Wake up like espresso
Wanna see your body move
Hands up, let’s go
Let’s put em to the roof
Heat it up like soup
Seeing is believe
And I know you’ve seen proof
Don’t sweat the small stuff
Open like a ocean
Having great times
And the world is in motion
Done a lot of good today
Now it’s time to go play
Outside, indoors
At the words encore

[Hook]
Here we go
Get together and get it started
Here we go

[Verse 2]
Today’s so unforgettable
Join the fun, want more
Ride of your life, yes please
Like a trapeze
Maps and the treasure chest keys
And seen a lot
Round the clock non-stop
Party like a sock hop
Flexing and stretching
And magic like a wizard
Magic in our fingertips
And moving like a [?]
Feel electricity, ambience, excellent
Extraordinarily well conditioned
Flying in the solar system
No cause for concern
Time is now, take your turn
This is it, it’s time to dance
You got this far, look at your hands
Breathe it in, loving life
Loving you, spin around the carousel
Anchors up, setting sail
Try your best, tonight’s the night
Live it up, live it up
