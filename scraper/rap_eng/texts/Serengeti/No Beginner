I'm not trying to kill turtles without hair string colors
I'm just trying to do rap songs and be down with my brothers
Hey maybe a few others too
We can get a Pay-Per-Veiw
We can watch boxing all the time or join the sound crew
Or the crew that changes ice to the warm courts
Makes athletes take off ice skates put on mesh shorts
That sounds like dandy
Watching a flick organized crime
I like the Wesley Snipes and Ving Rhames for the prison time belt
Making soda time mind
Passing it to a friend of mine
Maurine made cacciatore
Seasoned with a sprig of thyme

[Hook: x2]
Hot dog for lunch
Hot dog for dinner
Don't eat breakfast
I am no beginner, no

Just don't be gross
Like find long hairs in the bread
The only people that were there
Were Tommy and Craig
I'm a DJ now
Set list in my head
After a sooner or later
I'm going Club Med
Then walk around downtown
Hit up a Sky Gym
Maybe get a new suit
Double bag of fruit fruit
Gotta listen
Listen like magician
When it clicks in tricks 'em
Get paid, get paid
Tell me what's your dream job
Tell me what's your dream job
House husband hobbyist
Tell me what's your dream job

[Hook:]

Hot dog for lunch
Hot dog for dinner
Hot dog for breakfast
I am no beginner, no
