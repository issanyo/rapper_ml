Is it too late to say ‘I love you’ now?
Is it too late to say ‘I love you’ now?

A girlfriend that dies a killer
Specially no relation ship if you’re the one ill
So much regret like an abusive dad
Whose son don’t call
Now he’s all alone eyeballin them all
Girlfriend can really bless your soul sometimes
Fly like a butterfly sweet like a jug a wine
You can go through the motions like a broke mind
But when it’s taken from you
You’ll be crushed like a bitch's mind in the street
Destroyed by an acord’s feet
Heavy tossing and turning
Through the night and can’t sleep
What have I done so much regret
Like an old gun or an abusive dad
The way he used to beat his son
Take out his worries on the poor kid
Now he quick tempered, shy, and always blows his lid
Messed up
If you ain’t feelin right fess up
Funeral’s rolling round there’s no time to back up

Is it too late to say ‘I love you’ now?
Is it too late to say ‘I love you’ now?

I never got to say it out loud
Too dumb, too proud
Walking with my head in the clouds
Too high to come down

What can I say to you?
Can I just start again?

You never know till it wasn’t
Thick CDs, books, boxes of old buttons
Thoughts filter from the ropes of a high killer
So many regets in the midst of a dark chiller
And move on
So many moves till your turn’s gone
Three little words could have been a new song
Called romantic, fall asleep dancing
Did I ever tell you son
You look so handsome?

The past that follows me
Can I just go again?
What was I thinking?
Who was that person that I was?

Is it too late to say ‘I love you’ now?
Is it too late to say ‘I love you’ now?

I never got to say it out loud
Too dumb, too proud
Walking with my head in the clouds
Too high to come down

The past that follows me
I’m watching movies in my brain
Who was that person that  I was?
How did I get a starting role?

Is it too late to say ‘I love you’ now?
(What was I thinking)
Is it too late to say ‘I love you’ now?
(Who was that person that I was)

No

Is it too late to say ‘I love you’ now?
(Who was that person that I was)
Is it too late to say ‘I love you’ now?
(Who was that person that I was)
