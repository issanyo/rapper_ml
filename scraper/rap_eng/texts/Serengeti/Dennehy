This goes out to my girl Jules

[Hook]
Favorite actor Dennehy, favorite drink O'Doul's
Bears, Hawks, Sox, Bulls

So say goodbye a little longer like I ate a piece of Big Red
Grew a mustache the size of Mike Ditka's forehead
Hair combed to the side looking like a piece of foam
Buick speakers, red cooler, '85 Bears Zubaz
Polish sausage, bratwurst, walking like my cock hurts
Stacy Adams, no shirt, Jewel's to get a case of Squirt
Wife's pissed cause I forgot to get the Minute Rice
So I'm back in the damn Buick to get a stinking bag of ice

To get a stinking bag of rice, my wife Jules is cute
Her taste really moved me like I ate Juicy Fruit
Had me dancing like Chris Penn in Footloose
'85 Walter Roo's, Old Style pack of Kools
Go to Ace, new tools and weed wacker fuel
'85 Bears Zubaz, Stacy Adams got ruined
Flood a basement sump pump, Shop-Vac cleanup
Cook brats, cook chops, your heat shouldn't be that hot

Keep your juices in the chops, keep your juices in the brats
Serve 'em on paper plates, 'tato salad and grape pop
My favorite actor was Dennehy long before he played Knight
When Berenger was a substitute, everything was going right
Even after Jordan left, and Dave Corzine retired
Shawon Dunston's wild throws and Mike Ditka got fired

[Hook]

Play softball with the guys, wife made curly fries
Drink about four O'Doul's, grounded out, two pop flies
In the Buick down Western, stop and get some more brats
On sale: chicken, Italian sausages, and orange pop
This week, fishing trip, gotta get some new flies
Wife packed turkey subs, Jays chips, and peach pies
Watch a little Dennehy, pull out the Laserdisc
Sniper 1, 2, and 3, Berenger makes great flicks

Listen to the Shuffle, rewind Richard Dent's part
Damn I left those orange pops in the trunk of the Skylark
Sneak a couple O'Doul's, shit there's my damn wife
You know, honey, I'll be back I gotta get some more ice
Back in the damn Buick, I should go to the damn bar
I saw Ditka once on the Edens in a sports car

[Hook]

Play a little poker, spend time with the wife
Take her out to Bennigan's, see if they cook chops right
Go out and get a Laserdisc, projection screen TV
Portillo's Italian beef and a movie starring Tommy B
Back in the damn Buick, cut on WCKG
Caught a song by Glenn Frey and an interview with Dennehy
So I'm driving down Western Ave, think I'm gonna stop at Zayre's
Got a splittin fricking headache, so I popped a couple Bayers

So I'm back in the damn Buick, think I need a oil check
The Baddest of George Throrogood smokes Stoges on my deck
Read the sport section, Bears and their o-line
Trying to find a decent Fiero with a For Sale sign
Cut on WCKG, Huey Lewis and the News
The heart of rock & roll is still beatin, DONTLETDABEARSLOSE!

[Hook]

Favorite actor Dennehy, favorite drink O'Doul's

If I was coaching the Bears, we'd at least get ten wins
