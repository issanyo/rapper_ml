[Verse 1]
Let’s get it
Keep it moving to the finish
Push it to the limit and we win it every minute
Fact not opinion, you can put your people in it
Hands to the sky if you’re feeling so terrific
Listen to the lyric, people try to mimic
This is good advice, loving life should be a gimmick
Never feeling timid, feeling joyous, scientific
Try to catch the spirit cause I hate for you to miss it

[Hook]
[?] leave it to chance
Don’t leave

[Verse 2]
Come by for a visit
We can kick it cause we get that
Stop for a second if you feel a little winded
Pumping up the party, spilling out into the lobby
I want to see you jump
Until your legs are floppy
Push it to the max, later on you can relax
All you gotta do is move your body to the traps
All you gotta do is move around between the cracks
Trust me when I tell you that this is where it’s at

[Hook]
Don’t leave things to chance
Don’t leave it to
Don’t leave it to chance
Don’t leave it to
Don’t leave it to chance
