[Verse]
She said she liked me
Even if I made shoes
Even if I was down on my luck
Tried to help me up
[?]
Church lady
I told her all my dreams and hey
She said ‘take is easy baby’
Take a load off
Relax in the day
You can’t build a lakefront
You have everything you want
Here’s a gift
It’s a leather bracelet
I bought it when I went to [?]
Wear it on your wrist
Give me a kiss and I’ll be back later
Wait up for me
I’ll bring back some movies and some dinner
Remember that you’re a number one winner
You’re not a loser
Go listen to that Charlie Brown record
Over and over and getting upset
Now I can move to the [?]
Cause I got this French freak
That’s so sleek like the walls of Jericho
She wears her hair in a bun
And lets it undone
Take tips [?]
[?]
Spent afternoon making salmon patties and eggs
Watch daddy longlegs climb the wall
Playing Pitfall
Taking demerol
Throwing [?] in the sheets
Making sweaty heat that’s so tender
All I feel is splendour
I surrender
Baby you won
You’re totally the one
This is so much fun
This is driving me
Like a child’s fleeting hobby
Such as tennis or karate
But now I work on my body
I get in real good shape
Stroll around and hit parties
[?]
Busty women
I bring women to my playpen
Tell them that they better stay there
Or else there’ll be some trouble
There’ll be some subtle changes
In the way you meet strangers
There’s gonna be some major changes
Funny how things change
In just a matter of a little time
