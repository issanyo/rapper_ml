[Intro: Amy Stroup]
Show me where the sun stands to the dark
Show me where to find my buried heart
Cause I can the traces in the faces that you left
And I can see your colors, they're faded, faded, faded
In cracks and creases, these little pieces of my mind

[Chorus]
Bits and pieces of you everywhere
And everything I've ever known
I feel [?], saturated
You come and go, you come and go, you come and go
Like a shadow in the shadow

[Verse 1]
We walked on the beach at midnight
I remember we went to a theme park
Storms did not hide the harvest moon
Matching clothes and matching shoes
We didn't think about the lightning
We got home well after midnight
I dragged your body into the sea

I let you be (there's bass)
In cracks and (there's snares) creases (there's rhythm)
These little (there's drums) pieces on my mind (there's love)

[Chorus]
Bits and pieces of you everywhere
And everything I've ever known
I feel [?], saturated
You come and go, you come and go, you come and go
Like a shadow in the shadow

[Interlude]
(Do you mind)

(There's bass) in cracks and (there's snares) creases (there's rhythm)
These little (there's drums) pieces on my mind (there's love)

[Chorus]
Bits and pieces of you everywhere
And everything I've ever known
I feel [?], saturated
You come and go, you come and go, you come and go
Like a shadow in the shadow
In cracks and creases
These little pieces
