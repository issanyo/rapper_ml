[Verse 1]
Fly high all over the globe
Need to pump this up cause you’re in control
You get so high like a totem pole
You could win the bronze, silver, and the gold
Clap clap like a curtain call
Ego so big that you went [?]
You can party all night
Better have some balls
To the glory hole right in the wall, yeah
[?]
And feel the beat walking down the street
Feeling like a star, louder than guitar
[?]
Clap clap like a curtain call
[?]

[Verse 2]
My wife’s bull was a hibachi chef
Made those veggies come to life
Even made short arias
About how he was with the wife
The whole thing was beautiful
The romance between the onions
Everyone was crying
In their seperate dinner functions
It was like a opera
What a cold little hand
When he made those peppers sizzle
I told my lady I understand
There’s magic in the air
There’s a rhythm to devotion
The tide moves in and out
The power is unspoken

[Verse 3]
My wife’s bull was a hibachi chef
Hands powerful and thin
At the table five couples
If you were counting her and him
Wife is like a phantom limb
Effusive [?] and in a trance
The way those little florettes moved
And we’d been through our final dance
He moves like poetry
I loved you first [?]
Warm from the fire
As the onion spews the flame above
I close my eyes
And I felt the world depressurise
Bull was a hibachi chef
And a blessing in disguise
