[Verse 1: Serengeti]
This romance is knitted quilts
And very soft strings of yarn
Sharing plates of spinach parm
And never having to move your arm
Charm is charm but yours is more like
Overflowing candy drawers
Returning from the greatest war
I adore our rapport
We feel like batteries in toys
Otters and their silly ploys
A haunted house and scary noise
The fashions of a teddy boy
To cook with sherry and juices from stems of poison pigeon berry
Romantic hugs and Finnish ferries
Mountain blue and green canaries

[Hook]
I’d prefer if you were around
I’d prefer if you were around

[Verse 2: Serengeti]
We toasted sweet burger buns
That time we fell in love in Schtad
Fed each other Shish Kabobs
I love you like an angry god
Alaskan cod and silly quips
I wish you’d leave that man you’re with
We’ll get a place like in Peru
You’ll meet me up like oysters do
Turn cold like pigeon flu
Undercover secret life
Hidden like a switchblade
The arm that hides the face of nights
And this is all that I can have
Romantic New York City cabs
And weeks and weeks and you can’t talk
Cancel plans and lonely walks
Plans and lonely walks

[Hook x2]
