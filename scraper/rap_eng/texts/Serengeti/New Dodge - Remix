[Jueles]
Kenny, Kenny! Where's the clicker to the Zenith?

[Kenny]
I can't hear you Jueles

[Jueles]
Kenny, turn down the Springsteen! Kenny, turn on the sprinklers! Turn down the Springsteen!

[Kenny]
I can't hear you Jueles, I'll be there in a second

[Jueles]
Ok, Kenny!

[Kenny]
Ok, Jueles what do you think?

[Jueles]
Go to Jewels and get me some smokes

[Kenny, Chorus]
Traded in the Buick, got a new Dodge
Still got my Fiero in the garage
When Jueles' feet hurt, give her a massage
Drink a couple O'Doul's down at the lodge
If you go huntin' you'll need camouflage
I'd rather watch a Berenger flick about counter-espionage

[Verse 1]
Okay
O'Doul's, go to Jueles, call [?]
In our house we have rules
Jueles, no smokin' in the bedroom
(Jueles: Ok, Kenny, no Dennehey before noon)
Dammit, me and Jueles [?], I wear boots
I found my Fiero on 119th and [juke?]
Jueles makes the best minestrone soup
She goes to Dominick's in her '84 Camaro coupe
I don't wear suits, I service telephone booths
Jueles, [?] and reshingles old roofs
I love the sax player of the band Bruce plays in (Bruce the Boss)
If they'd make it I'd drink chopped juice
[?] has great watch deuce
Peter Francis, Geraldine Ferraro, Gregory Hines, [?]
Lemme call Jueles
(phone rings) Hello?
Uh, what is, uh what is your name? Francis?
I need some Kools, I need some Kools, I need some Daniels
Ok, Jueles
Get yourself a case of O'Douls

[Kenny, Chorus]
Traded in the Buick, got a new Dodge
Still got my Fiero in the garage
When Jueles' feet hurt give her a massage
Drink a couple O'Doul's down at the lodge
If you go huntin' you'll need camouflage
I'd rather watch a Berenger flick about counter-espionage

[Verse 2]
Sell a [?] by Comiskey
I drink O'Doul's
Jueles drinks whiskey
I play a pool game for a cool fifty, even
"You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet" like BTO
Saturday afternoon, O'Doul's at Big Joe's
[?] games
Catch a flick by Ving Rhames
My wife Jueles: Teased hair, bleached bangs
Zubaz, a lion eye
Taco Bell, chalupas
Fiero keys, Pontiac bucket seats
Meats like chops
Barney Miller
Cops from Fox
Jueles, Zayre's
O'Doul's, Bears
Buick gears
Meat from steers
More annoying
Grape[?] chops
Cardinal Kools
Playin' pool

[Jueles]
Get me some Springsteen tickets and and if the BTO tickets are on sale get those too

[Kenny, Chorus]
Traded in the Buick, got a new Dodge
Still got my Fiero in the garage
When Jueles' feet hurt give her a massage
Drink a couple O'Doul's down at the lodge
If you go huntin' you'll need camouflage
I'd rather watch a Berenger flick about counter-espionage

[Verse 3]
What the hell did Jueles need?
Hopped in my Fiero, Jueles gave me a kiss
A fifty dollar bill and a very long shopping list
Popped in a tape, "Taking Care of Business"
I love the Destroyers
And Berenger in Sea of Love
It's a sunny day outside
I got my Fiero driving gloves on
Going to the Jewels on Kinzie
My favorite Jackson's Jesse
Last night me and Jueles watched Beverly Hills Cop
Really love his music too, Eddie Murphy rocks
But Jueles doesn't like to "Party All The Time"
Me and Jueles go to Dominick's
I got my shirt signed once by Earl ???
When Jueles cooks, no remains
I'm at the Jewels now, Zubaz, pair of Zubaz
Coolers, Bears, where's the list?

[Jueles, Verse 4]
Summer of '84 I met Kenny
I was in my Thunderbird
Drivin' down Pulaski
T-tops were off, carwash left the T-bird shiny
Just bought a new crimping iron at Walgreens
Then I started getting hungry
Only place to get a good dog is at Gene and Jude's
What's this? A blue Fiero blasting the blues
The rest is history, like the '85 Bears, '88 Illini and the 1919 Sox
But hey, who's counting?

[Kenny]
Jueles smokes way too many cigarettes
I drink O'Doul's
I first had my first O'Doul's in 1991
In ran into Harry Caray on the street
He told me a story about O'Doul's that really blew my mind about
Brewing, later, hops, and aged barley and malts
I really love the taste of O'Doul'
Not the amber, but the green stuff
