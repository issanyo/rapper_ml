[Verse 1]
And when the second son comes
Bastion of hope
In the aesthetic age
Because we all like pretty
Who appreciates shitty
Besides the mutants
That were trapped behind ice
And didn't even know spice
And only ate dead mice and since
Money wasn't even real
The whole world is over now
No council to the crown
Unless we honor the sun
Look out for us
Who can you really trust
When everybody's tryin' to sell you somethin'?

[Chorus]
My nega-nega-nega
My nega-nega-nega
My nega-ti!
My nega-nega-nega

[Verse 2]
Allegiance pledged to convenience
So it's an essential place
Everything is for you, sir
Nape rub not a peep
Sheep little gentle sleep
Eat islands only fish
Sets eat bloodsucking death
Shallow high confusion fun
Grow prison educate
Please be a living loom
Some colors stand for poison spit
Camouflage but isn't this the most
Awesomest excellent forever to ever?

[Chorus]
My nega-nega-nega
My nega-nega-nega
My nega-ti!
My nega-nega-nega

[Post-Chorus]
It's just me
Me and my natural negati-
Flowing, flowing
Color, color, color circles spit

[Chorus]
My nega-nega-nega
My nega-nega-nega
My nega-ti!
My nega-nega-nega
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
