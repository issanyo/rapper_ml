[Intro]
Louise, R.N
Today I was walking
Estimated release date: one week from today

[Verse 1]
The antibiotics made me hallucinate
Cops arresting patients, Arabian spiders inside my arms
And Uncle Traum
And then my wife got shot
She was seeing him for a year
I had no idea, 'til brother's post

[Verse 2]
I'm in the hospital
I told pretty Louise, the R.N., and she checked in about 4 am
I haven’t slept the whole night
I called the wife’s folks to find out when the funeral was
No one ever answered the phone

[Verse 3]
In brother's post she was shot in a drug deal
Traum was a meth addict
I saw him smoking crack through a block window
In the basement. He was in his bed, he played speed metal too
She was in his press photos, damn it
I had no idea

[Verse 4]
I'm in the hospital
She was dancing for him, with the lovers
She could really dance, really dance
Really move, really move
I'm wide awake waiting for the morning news
It’s sure to be the lead story, man
"Drug deaths in Des Plaines, shooter's not apprehended, no suspects"
It's 7 AM, news ain't coming on
It's Sunday. I had no idea
Some movie. Called and called and calling
I'm scared
When they took out my breathing tube
