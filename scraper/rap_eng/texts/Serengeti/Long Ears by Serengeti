Guess who's back, your old broken down dad
Came back to say he loves you and that he feels bad
Jeez Father, welcome back Cotter
Take me to the zoo so we can see the seals, and the penguins, and the otters
Where you been?
We had to sleep in a church gym
I know you play the drums and your music is number one
But come on, pops, I was hanging out by truck stops
We could have used your help when Mom was stalked by that creepy cop
Understand the pressures of being in a band, touring all over the land, getting closer and closer to freedom
I'm glad you're back, Father, please don't leave me again
I know I'm a grown person but I could use your fatherly grin
Dad's back tonight after years on the run, town after town setting up tenor drums

Chorus:
Father's back, high school flowers match blue cummerbund
Just when you heard it first, long ears and a short tongue
Since Dad's return, it's great having Pop's back, too big for his shoulders or to ride on my dad's back
I'm cool with that, the first time I tried smack
He's been doing it for years, great way to make tracks
It's fine, Father and Son time, he moved into my apartment Mom's jealous Dad always shines
But I don't know, he doesn't always chip in on stuff
It was fine at first, but I never got reimbursed
And I thought it'd be romantic, if we'd do drugs together
What a beautiful peace, me and my dad on the pad asleep
Curse them, those stupid mounted police
Dad got nabbed on a warrant he had back East
Pops is gone, never did see the otters
Kicked out my place but I finally met my daughter

Chorus:
Back in high school flowers match blue cummerbund
Just when you heard it first, long ears and a short tongue
(Female voice):
Guess who's back, your old broken down dad
Came back to say he loves you and that he feels bad
Jeez Father, welcome back Cotter
Take me to the zoo so we can see the seals, and the penguins, and the otters (otters otters)
