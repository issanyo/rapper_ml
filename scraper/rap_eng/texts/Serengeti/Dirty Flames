[Verse 1]
Jean-Michel Basquiat of rap
Ah man
Deliver rhymes like a baby doctor
Open shirt and steaks
Hot plates with snails
Hot dates with long nails
And long skirts
Long flirts with eyelashes
Barely [?]
So many facets
Thick lips
Stick shifts and seatbelt prints
Sunroof
Straight [?] music
On point
[?]
I party like [?]
Write raps like a haiku
By the pool
Play it cool like Snoopy
Colours like [?]
Rock tan while these [?] catch me

[Hook]
Dirty Flames, F5 through the pouring rain
Pearl Porsche Coupe
Evening dinners
[?]
The number one basement rapping women
Enough girls, enough pearls to circle the world

[Verse 2]
[?]
Upset like a rapper when his Bentley got dented
Stained bloody linen
Stained facial grinning
[?]
Purple Porsche Coupe
The title, my recital
To make friends
I wrote a novel called ‘Super Trends’
I prefer lamb racks and giant stacks of cash
Flavour artistic
Rap imprint
[?] music
Didn’t come to use it

[Hook]
Dirty Flames, F5 through the pouring rain
Pearl Porsche Coupe
Evening dinners
[?]
The number one basement rapping women
Enough girls, enough pearls to circle the world

[Verse 3]
Glass tables
Bikini lines and halos
French wine and tables
Outside by the pool
We say so
Straw hats
Flower patch and curves
Sun tans and hella stirred mixes
Funny [?]
Let’s cruise wearing flip flop shoes
Stepping out the pale Porsche
A lot of ‘why’, ‘yes’, and ‘of course’
Steez, foreign trees, exotic leaves
Exotic F5 members please

[Verse 4]
Dirty bird
The city
Master of the words
Master of parking Porsches by the city curb
Feel the vibe
When it rains we head inside
Close the door and lock it
Have a seat
Filthy flamingo speech
Iconoclastic
Rap fabric
[?] seats
Crucial dragonskin beats
Rap as large as Twin Peaks
Rap as large as Cadillac seats

[Hook]
Dirty Flames, F5 through the pouring rain
Pearl Porsche Coupe
Evening dinners
[?]
The number one basement rapping women
Enough girls, enough pearls to wrap around the whole world
