Pinnacle
Criminal
Difficult miracle
Fucking embarrassing
Pitiful
Minimal
Dead in the head
Like a rat on my bed
With his teeth all a ready
To bled me in pleasure
So he sucked out my soul with the Devil's integrity
Yeah he sucked out my soul with the Devil's integrity

I am a witness
Acrylic an institute
Fuck me I'm heavy
I'm fucking incredible
Mess with my lesson
Devotion my heaven in question is heavy
And mental addiction adventure
I'm down on the floor and the rug is a mess
I'm a crab with a kiss and a squid on my chest
I can feel you beside me
I feel you around me
Equation is algebra
Lesson
Confession
I need you, be near me
I kill you, endear me
I kiss you
I catch you
I kid you
I want your protection
I jump like a tango
A kangaroo
Monogamy song is a mess
My address
I'm all sweaty
I need you beside me like Sisyphus
Down on me, holdin' me
Thrown like a knife
He's found in the stone
But I know he's a killer
The weight of the pillar
My theories a thriller
My stories are filler
I feel like venom
I'll bite you despite you
I wanted to like you
But I'll suck out your soul with the Devil's integrity
I'll suck at your dick with the Devil's integrity

I am not my father
I am not my father
I am not my father
I am not my father
