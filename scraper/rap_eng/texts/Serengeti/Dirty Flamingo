[Hook]
I’m the dirtiest man alive
I’m the dirtiest man alive
I’m the dirtiest
I’m the dirtiest man alive
The dirtiest flamingo rapper to ever [?]
I’m the dirtiest man alive
I’m the dirtiest man alive
The dirtiest person
I’m the worst person to ever start rapping
I’m the dirtiest

[Verse 1]
Used to be wise and wordly
Now all I care is girlies
Put them on the glass and thrill me
I give you kudos
Tell my boys about the [?]
Tell ‘em I got a [?]
Just crack a couple
They be like [?]
I’m like ‘I’m trying to time travel’
I’m trying to see the hanging gardens
And the Tower of Babel
Then I woke up on the couch rattled
Super sensitive
Secret attentiveness
I never mentioned this
To not a soul
They’re like ‘dude, you ain’t got no goals
You hanging out like a flag on a pole’
Then I shrug my shoulders
And say this is me when I’m older
The whole genre that I’m in is colder
[?]
You know how it gets
Gin and [?]
This is [?]
Ride the bus and the shit stalls
[?]

[Hook]
I’m the dirtiest man alive
I’m the dirtiest man alive
I’m the dirtiest
I’m the dirtiest man alive
The dirtiest flamingo rapper to ever touch a mic
I’m the dirtiest man alive
I’m the dirtiest man alive
I’m the dirtiest
I’m the dirtiest man alive
The dirtiest rapper
Ah shit

[Verse 2]
R. Kelly
I’m the same as smelly
I’m the same as the giant fat enormous belly
Full of Twinkies
Full of you can’t see me
Full of I’m the worst person ever
Start cursing and sleep with [?]
Eating pork [?] with giant corn
Feeling like porn
Asking [?]
Saying a lot of other things stupid
And acting dumber
Feeling like a plumber
I came through with a stutter
Came through in a giant green jeep
Being a gunner
Saying ‘oops’
Cleaning up beagle poop
Trying to convince people to hear my song
Feeling like a mountain [?]
Feeling like a gong
Feeling like yo, listen to me
Listen to F5
Real life
We in the sun
We the dirtiest
We the

[Hook]
I’m the dirtiest man alive
I’m the dirtiest man alive
Dirty flamingo
Dirty flamingo
I’m the dirtiest man alive
I’m the dirtiest
I’m the dirtiest man alive
I’m the dirtiest man alive
I’m the dirtiest
I’m the dirtiest man alive
Dirty flamingo, F5
Bring it home baby
