[Verse 1]
I sound secret like a whisper, fake like a denture
Disappointing like the hard times of your mentor
Rocky roads, little jungle toads
Secret like the shit was written in a cloaky code
Can’t read it, talk to me like Curtis Loader
Rap shit don’t work, become a chauffeur
Know the streets, stadiums and tiered seats
Pop the truck driver, turn up Bon Iver
Disappointing dash spokes, wanted to be a scuba coach, expand like James Polk
But instead, after Bon Iver, Papa Roach
Sir, don’t forget your coat
I was a mentor, yo, talk to me

[Hook]
Yeah, where you been, honey?
Yeah, where you been, baby?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, work hard or very rich
Keep it together like a ten stitch
Enjoy yourself like a sexy bitch
NBA wives arguing outside
A sense of beauty and pride
Watching women fight for guys
Whatever, people all have their faults
Like skimming a couple grand for your company’s bank vault
And you were trusted, left the upper brass disgusted
Took years for the company to get readjusted
Or your wife having a secret family in Gary
Her second spouse kind of looks like Neneh Cherry
Whatever, cut the lady some slack
I’ve been getting bent back
Peace to sudden impact

Where you been?

[Hook]

Where you’ve been?

[Outro]
Baby, bank vault, secret, baby
How come you smell like a [?]?
Yo where you been?
[?]
Yo where you been honey?
-baby, yeah
Yo where you been baby?
Yo where you been baby?
Yo where you been honey?
-baby, yeah
