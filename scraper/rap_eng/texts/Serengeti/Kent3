[Verse 1]
You’re so cute, I think you’re trending
Tonight’s the night, let’s stop pretending
I just wanna do something while I can
No seperate cheques, I wanna be your man
Oh my gosh, what a day
I’m feeling cool, I feel okay
Worked a long week to pay the bill
Overtime is overkill
Found a date I met at the gym
Party so hard, over him, over her
It’s such a blur, I really can’t tell or remember
Sunset Strip look like a rocker
Tight leather jeans, not cotton Dockers
Tonight’s the night, go out and play
Can’t party like a rockstar every day

[Hook]
Cuz we've been we been we been
Cuz we've been we been we been
We gonna work it out we gonna work it out
We gonna work it out we gonna work it out

[Verse 2]
Your hands and my mind on your back
When I look at you, chemicals react
Where my whole life you been at?
Made my heart jumped up like an acrobat
When the DJ play our track
Place feels empty, but it’s packed
Feeling all smooth like a opera hat
Look so hot, where’s the thermostat?
You’re so cute, I think you’re trending
Coast to coast, I ain’t pretending
The magic has it, mad convincing
What’s it gonna take for you to stop and listen?
Forget what you heard, tell me what do you vision?
Do I do it for you? Make some decisions
Abracadabra, feel like I’m floating
When we start to land, can we keep this going?

[Hook]
