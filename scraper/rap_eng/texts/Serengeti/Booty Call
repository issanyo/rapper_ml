[Serengeti]
Read it, cheat it, do you want to beat it?
Do you ever think a motherfucker eat it?
Feed it, stampede it, don't cheat it
Is it one of those things at the rodeo bar where you say you won't delete it?
I don't ever want to say I don't believe it
Get your arms untied, can you open real wide?
I don't ever want to say I'm undefeated
Can you run on your own?
Can you huddle with a Capricorn?
Are you still afraid of the storm?
Do you want to make a porn?
(Nah)
What day, what month were you born?
Me, I'm a Cancer
Got all the answers
Catch me on the floor, I'm a motherfucking dancer
Beat it, don't tweet it, cheat it
Feed it, put it in your mouth, eat it
Got a taste in my mouth, can I go to your house
Just little bit south of the city?
Do you really have a kitty?
Talk to me lover, can you tell me what's your name?
Beauty, computey, let me see that booty
Let me be your call of duty
Tomahawk
"Get it off I don't want to get sauced"
Do you want to be my lover?
Do you want to be discovered?
Like Venus--
Have you seen it?
Can you dream it?
(Yeah)
Do you really think I need it?
Beam me up Scotty, you're a motherfucking genius
Do you really want to eat it?
Stop
Why're you acting all defeated?
Did you put your heart in a boy who beat it?
I've got a magazine, a machine gun
I'm gonna get you, I know I got one
Boom!
In the backseat
Where I'm going to meet it
And beat it
And greet it
Unseated
I don't ever want to be a fucking peanut
I may be the cleanest, meet me in the Zenith
I'll never ever let nothin' come between us
Hurricane hunger, check out the thunder
GIRL
(Shit)
We ain't getting any younger
Go read it, don't treat it like a Phoenix
Burn where the baby goes, tell me about them other boys
Do they love you like a Playboy? Or a Gameboy?
Here's my crescendo, put away Nintendo
We don't need no curtains on the window
Let me see your banks, let me see your books
Let me see your legs, let me see your hooks
Sing an opera, candelabra
Imma get a condom, put it on my Mazda
Wanna see my light show?
I can tell you want to go--
Boom

Imma kiss you like a bubble in the brooks [x4]
