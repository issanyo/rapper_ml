[Verse 1]
Before you drive, destress
Be late, call ahead
A little courtesy goes a long way in a human head
Am I right?
It feels better being polite
Control what you can control
It’s important to set goals
In my mind I used to find it hard to unwind
Waiting for emails so much
That I always felt stuck
So now I do my work
And I gave it all up
Before I drive, destress, look alive, good luck

[Hook]
I’m in the zone, whatever it takes
Throw your hands in the sky if you can relate
Wave them side to side, just don’t wait
We come alive and it’s never too late
We got the power
We got the power
I’m in the zone, whatever it takes
Throw your hands in the sky if you can relate
Wave them side to side, just don’t wait
We come alive and it’s never too late
We got the power
We got the power

[Verse 2]
Tallahassee, FSU you [?] drink your yoohoo
In that dress you’re Yokohama
Talk to you like we do drama
Let you touch my Dalai Lama
Kiss your daddy, hug your mama
Let’s pretend that we got married
Laid you down, I feed you berries
Feed you grapes, make you dinner
Cook your pasta, turn my spinner
Bend down and touch the dance floor
Oh Caramel I know you want more
Look at me, I taste your cooking
Eat your stew, draw outline with my shoe
Oh Caramel
Oh Caramel

[Verse 3]
You’re all my dreams
Mountain streams and fluffy crowds
I’m singing like a gondolier
The stars spell out your name so clear
Your hand in mine, mine on your back
The DJ plays our favourite track
Place feels empty but it’s packed
We keep it going no matter where we at
Oh Caramel, I rap for you
I love your outline and your stew
You taught me when I drive, destress
Those little things could matter less
Here’s a [?] jelly bean
Orange and green and roses bud
Our rubber boots were caked in mud
Our camping ground was soaked in rain
Snuggled up when thunder came
I took a feather from my hat
And flew away from where I at
Oh Caramel, all I got
Is a pair of Jordans, a Rolex watch
You said I had a gift
Just don’t soak my life in scotch
Oh Caramel, you’re crystal clear
Like a Pepsi or a cheer
