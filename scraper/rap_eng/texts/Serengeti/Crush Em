Crushed 'em

The English are great
They make tennis, golf, boxing
America made football
Beefs and leg stockings
Take a breather
Like Craig Hodges on a time out
Smooth like mahogany
The English made economy
America made comedy
Have a laugh, like Steve Seagull
Above the law, Nico
Craig Hodges Park Forest
Richie's Berenger, Sniper 4
Craig Hodges Sniper 5: Perimeter
Craig Hodges downtown
In perimeter
Downtown, Park Forest, dollar flick, Justice
Steve Seagull, Gino, Kelly Lebrock, Nico
Portillo's slices
British made from British knights
[?] New York City, Jeresy
Dereck Coleman, America, Hulk Hogan
Get a life, properly
Bread mint, Shepard's cake
Also made the lottery
America made power fifty
Sapphire tennis balls
Probably caught KD crushing Nitro into the wall in Power Ball

Straight crushing them
Straight, straight, straight crushing them
Straight, yeah, straight crushing them
Straight, straight, straight crushing them
Straight, straight crushing them
To the Wall

So Kelly, Gino, Nico, Tommy and Craig started at the castle
Late breakfast, eggs
Bacon, Tommy drink, coffee, Kelly drink tea
Craig ate, carrots, Craig used to see five on five
Kelly's in the low post, Craig and Tommy in the perimeter
Gino and Nico cherry picking on defense
It's not humid it's windy
Late coat, near 35th
Craig and Tommy downtown play the wind, swish
Metal chains downtown sound like metal rings to impress
Cleaning out trash
Beautify the out, beautiful
Craig and Nico and Tommy and Gino and Kelly big
At the castle, outline
After burn, carrots eat
You know how Craig is
You know how Craig is
You know how Craig is
Straight crushing 'em
You know how Craig is
You know how Craig is
Played all in perimeter
Straight crushing 'em
Fellow Craig, afterburner, out burner
Tommy played the Dragon's Lair
Aladdin's Castle's crew
Craig had Spanish four
Tommy had Shop too
Craig wore OP
Craig loved Ministry
Gino and Niko and Tommy, Kelly Lebrock
Aladdin's castle crew
What you gonna do?

Swish, all metal
