[Hook]
And her strength overwhelmed his karate
And her strength it overwhelmed the boy

[Verse 1]
Coin collections, camcorders and silverware
Estrangulacións, police called on the au pair
She’s been stressed since Jess left, that automatic withdrawal
A couple belts, several stripes
Poor little Charles

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now she doesn’t really drink
She just sits around and talks
And thought it’s totally Ginger’s fault, that her child couldn’t walk
Had to get another gig
Quick temper with little Chuck
Dreams of just returns were once cuddled by the bottle worm

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Everyday on the bus, roll with wretched old Ginger
Excuse after excuse about Hollywood and motorcross dreams
Made her think of her own son, and ideas that she once had
Takes it out on the boy
And the hope of his little class

[Outro]
And her strength overwhelmed his karate
And her strength overwhelmed the boy
And her strength overwhelmed his karate
And her strength overwhelmed the boy
And her strength overwhelms his karate
And her strength overwhelms the boy
