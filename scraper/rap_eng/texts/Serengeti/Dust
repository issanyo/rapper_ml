The strip club got sold, turned into Cash 4 Gold
Wanted to be a food stylist
Ended up at Little Caesar's, old
Called Cheaters, ended up on Cheaters
Wild, ain't it? Never bought a painting, either
Rosh Hashanah dinner, cater because I'm not paid
Warm up kugel and quiche, briskets
Washing dishes, get busy
"Hi" I wave, artist slash maid
Imagine waking up, suddenly having braids
"Dammit, blacked out, dammit again, at it again"
Unfortunately, when will I learn?
Can't smoke weed, wake up with braids
They hurt, they're too tight
Can't blink, it's too bright
I can't think
The strip club was too short
The tallest women had to lean over
This one lady, Rhoda, left, deployed
She's a soldier
The other lady, Iron, had a tattoo of ambrosia
I really loved the dancers, and the manager old-ass Rosa
It closes early on Sundays, all day Monday
By Tuesday, the Cash 4 Gold was gone, for sure
It was ugly
Unemployment ended, I guess it's sorta fitting
Supposed to be a stylist, taking pictures of chicken
Delivering pizzas, and pinning dining linens
My girl has five phones, I know the broad's cheating
Gone on the weekend, and she looks like a Puerto Rican
Called up Cheaters, just to get a cheap thrill
They said they'd call me later, they're filled
Iron and I kick it, we're friends, and reminisce
She lives in a motel, right off Tenth
She had photos of foods, she thought of me
Here come the cameras now (TV)

[Hook] x4
Do you love our motel?
(Call up one of my wife's phones)
Baby this is for us
(Broad)
Let me eat your perfume
Let me lick off your dust
(Let me try this number)
Used to be the sharpest goy, warming up the kugel boy
