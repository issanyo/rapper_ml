[Verse 1]
There is order to the world, artists are so chaotic
Stop being gloomy and recycle paper products
And why not, prolly might meet a cool girl
It ain’t only misery and depression in the world
There is order to be had, like living in Spain
Refinishing dressers and growing your own grains
Become a dentist, scribe poetry with quills
Exact your vengeance, become more skilled
In banking, drinking, critiquing films
Enjoy a nice novel on the top of a brothel
Watch the sunset and return to the hostel
Drop off your novel, return to the brothel and chill

[Verse 2]
Hey, lighten up here, turn your troubles into a poem
Make hat, sell ‘em, when you get mad, thrown 'em
Get stoned, burn everything you own
Carve little gnomes, out of a little stones
How’s that? Off the grid in search of solace
You can move to Hollis re-enroll in city college
Become a chef, take tiny little baby steps
Study music, fall in love with the treble clef
It don’t matter, be careful when you’re milk an adder
Improve your magic set, slick pair of daggers
It feel right? Heavy or light
Move to Oakland, blend into the night
And chill, motherfucker
Take a load off for me

[Verse 3]
Chill, relax, throw away your stuff
Get a job or don't, it won’t be enough
Do heroin, it's medicine, with a chick that's part Bedouin
Lovely lady friend that you met in the Netherlands
And on your travels, turn vegan, eat apples
Sneak bites of turkey ever since you turn thirty
Change your name to Edo, Bombay, or Terrence
Disappoint your parents from your disappointing parents
Sue your Bedouin friend, have feeling of remorse
Have sex with a horse, reconsider a divorce
And chill
Chill

[Outro]
I’m so happy you can slap me, you can fuck me and I’m the happy-
[?] so much that you can do
All the time
You be happy
I’m so happy you can slap me
You can slap me
I'll hang your paintings, we'll go dancing, we'll have a fun time-
