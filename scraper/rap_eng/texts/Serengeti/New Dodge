[Intro]
This goes out to the, to the one and only J-U-E-L-E-S: Jueles. This goes out to my friend Wilton, my friend Willy. Curtis and Maureen, Addie and Stace, everybody out there

[Hook]
Traded in the Buick, got a new Dodge
Still got my Fiero in the garage
When Jueles' feet hurt, giver her a massage
Drink a couple O'Doul's down at the lodge
If you go hunting, you'll need camouflage
But I'd rather watch a Berenger flick about counter-espionage
Counter-espionage

(You'll go so crazy for this one, Jueles)

[Verse 1]
Silent pop down the Kaminsky I drink O'Doul's
Jueles drinks whiskey
Play a pool game for a cool fifty, even
You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet," like BTO
Saturday afternoon, O'Doul's at Big Joe's
Sting games, catch a flick by Ving Rhames
My wife Jueles: teased hair, bleached bangs
Bleached Bangs
Camaro keys, bucket seats
Pontiac, man

[Hook]
Traded in the Buick, got a new Dodge
Still got my Fierro in the garage
When Jueles' feet hurt, give her a massage
Drink a couple O'Doul's down at the lodge
If you go hunting, you'll need camouflage
But I'd rather watch a Berringer flick about counter-espionage
Counter-espionage

Jueles, Jueles, you're crazy. This one's for you, Jueles! Yeah!
(Been a whole day since I seen Jueles)

[Verse 2]
The J is for Jewels
Cause at Jewels we get cases of O'Doul's
And cartons of Kools. It's all cool
The U is for Us
Cause Kenny and Jueles are synonymous
We're husband and wife:
Ditka and Bears
Picnic and Chairs
E is for Eating
Brats, chops, dogs, they're done
Jueles in Jordaches, Jewels has great buns
The L is for Huey Lewis and the "Power of Love"
"The Heart of Rock and Roll" is still beating
I need a new drug
The other E for the stinking '85 Bears
S'been twenty-odd years but who the hell cares?
S is for Softball
Jueles plays short stop
And if you play pool with Jueles she doesn't play slop
She really loves Thunderbirds and really digs Stacey Q
Only drinks Jack and wears a size 9 shoe
Says she was in her prime when she was 162
But now she eats burgers wrapped in cheese and bacon strips, too

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
When I met Jueles, I knew we'd get married
She didn't mess around with any Tom, Dick, or Harry
The Bears season was over, so if had to be February
The snow was 4 feet, that winter was legendary
All of a sudden everything became secondary
"Jueles this," "Jueles that," in my vocabulary

Aww man, she's the woman for me
The J is for Jueles and the K is for Kenny
Masterful at working our Zenith antennae
Always grilling and cooking dogs with me
Man, Jueles smells like chops
Stacey Q and Thunderbirds, she's hot

Traded in the Buick, got a new Dodge
I'm in the garage
Jueles, Julie
J-U, J-U-E-L, E-S
Jueles, Jueles, O'Doul's, Kools

[Hook]
Traded in the Buick, got a new Dodge
Still got my Fierro in the garage
When Jueles' feet hurt, giver her a massage
Drink a couple O'Doul's down at the lodge
If you go hunting, you'll need camouflage
But I'd rather watch a Berringer flick about counter-espionage
Counter-espionage
