[Verse 1]
Disturbed hives, Queen wasn't content
Itchy eyes stacks of shirts
Boxes beneath the piano bench
Baby stayed wet in the coroner
Dead Chia Pet
Cleanin' up
The spring, people clean up
Throw away a lot of things
Old boots
Terrarium, old new terrarium
Dead Chia Pet
Itchy eyes
Animal print boxers
Animals in disturbed hives
Queen wasn't that content
Queen wasn't that content
Queen wasn't that content
Queen wasn't that content

[Hook]
I'm a fan of the at home life
Every now and then I can't stop crying

[Bridge]
If there's a god, then he must not know me
Hasn't even take a glance this way
Take a glance this way

Is it today or yesterday
Tell me: Why am I still shaking?

[Hook]

[Outro]
Disturbed hives, Queen wasn't content
Shirts beneath the piano bench
The baby stayed wet
Old, Dead Chia Pet
This spring
This spring time
