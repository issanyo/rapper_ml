(Kiss)
(Yeah, yo)

Sorry, I really meant to wake you
But since you're up, do you mind if I taste you?
[Honey] Huh?
I'm in love a woman
I dunno if it's love but I always think about what she's doin'

Maybe she's gardening now
Maybe at the ice arena practicing her Salchow
You know, a double or a triple
Maybe going over contracts with a school principal
[Listen, honey]
Install some more neat trim
When students look up, you don't want them to think grim
What a great sales pitch
You keep this up, you're destined to be rich, bitch
[Honey]
You make everything right -
The hottest humid day to the most beautiful fog night
[Honey]
I'm in love with a woman
I dunno if it's love but I always think about what she's doin'

Buying olives and grapes
Is she having friends over, marinating steaks?
[Oh, honey]
I hope she doesn't have a date
She lives in California, we're separated by nine states
My name ain't even in the phone under D -
Random number: 3123...
"Hey who's this?"
Listening to Kiss
"I just want to tell you I always think about you, bitch"

[Well, honey]
I'm in love with a woman
I dunno if it's love but I always think about what she's doin'
Maybe she's going to a club
Maybe she's playing soccer, maybe buying drugs
Maybe she's cleaning her tub
Unclogging drains, yuck, yellow rubber gloves
[Honey]
V-neck T-shirt
Sort of sweaty, listening to Men At Work

She might have a night off
As far as rappers go, they flow soft, but
I'm in love with a woman
[Well, honey]
I always think about what the hell is this woman doin', man?
Especially at night
I think about some dude saying "yeah" and her saying "yeah, right there"
Scratchin' his back
Feet up in the air
Man that shit's whack

[Honey]
I guess she's only human
Especially since she don't know what the hell I'm doin'
Or much less care
I'm at the crib, drinkin' Big Bear
In my mind like Fred Astaire
Dancin' all around, like the prom queen in king crown
My life's upside down
Like a cake or the life and times of Bobby Brown, man

[Honey]
Still I think about her often
As I get older and close to the coffin
I dearly need love
I wanna feel impervious to pain like a metal glove
Like a released a flock of white doves
This shit gets worse when I'm buzzed
I hope she don't go to the club
I always think about
[Honey]
Yeah [Honey]

I'm in love with a woman
I dunno if it's love but I always think about what she's doin'

[Gimme a kiss, honey]
[Gimme a kiss]
[I'mma put you out here and ride you back]

I'm in love with a woman
I dunno if it's love but I always think about what she's doin'
[Listen, man]
[Gimme a kiss]
[Listen, listen, listen]
Listening' to Kiss [Honey]

[Do you mind if I kiss you?]
[Be my woman]
[Do you mind if I hug you?]
[Be my woman and stand by me]
[Do you mind if I kiss you?]
[Be my woman]
[Do you mind if I hug you?]
[That's the way it's got-got-got to be]
