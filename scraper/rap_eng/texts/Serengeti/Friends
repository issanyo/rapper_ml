[Verse 1]
There's Derrick, Motley, Corey, and Tommy
Wonderful lady Rhonda, a friend of my ma
Visited there, back when my ma still had hair
We walked around, she gave me the most juiciest pear
It trickled down my pinstripes
Her son Darryl was cool
He had the nicest dirt bike
Pretty chrome
That week really felt like home
I never have to be alone (Yeah!)

[Hook: Serengeti & Kiki Bohemia]
I have so many friends in New York City
I have so many friends in New York
I have so many friends in New York City
I have so many friends in New York
New York
New York
(Hi)

[Verse 2]
There's Carla and Stooley and Linda and Joley
Mommy's boyfriend had a neighbor named Lanoley
We played scully in a beautiful park in Brooklyn
It was so late
The sun was so pretty in Mommy's hair
Puerto Rican dishes shared on the stoops
Most comfortable place to ever envision

[Outro: Serengeti & Kiki Bohemia]
(All the time
You are one of the strange kind)

I have so many friends in New York City
I have so many friends in New York
I have so many friends in New York City
I have so many friends

I have so many friends in New York City
I have so many friends in New York

(All the time, all of the time
You are one of a strange kind)
