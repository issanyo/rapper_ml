[Verse 1]
Before you drive, destress, be late, call ahead
A little courtesy goes a long way in a human head
Am I right, it feels better being polite
Control what you can control
It’s important to set goals
In my mind I used to find it hard to unwind
Waiting for emails so much that I always felt stuck
So now, I do my work and gave it all up
Before I drive, destress, look alive, good luck

[Verse 2]
Dream big, big sleep, sleep well dreams
There might be problems on your socials
And people not liking things
An unfollow here or there
Or losing your hair
You could always erase
And give yourself time to prepare
A little space, you could go to the gym
Find a date, get trim
Maybe go to a movie or sit in a jacuzzi
Or you can buy likes if that’s what you want
Let’s get pumped
I’m for everybody getting what they want

I’m not hashtag driven
I’m not hashtag driven
I’m not hashtag driven
I’m not hashtag driven
I’m not hashtag driven

[Verse 3]
[?]
Being single is great
Every day can be a hot date
Waiter with a hot plate
Saying hey back down
This plate is spicy and hot
For you you got the fox
And for you, I forgot
I’ll be right back
A little lonely, connect with your stalker
Had a pep in your step
When you knew you had a watcher
On stage, bravo
Tell me everything you know
It’s not a message, it’s your battery getting low

[Hook]
I’m not hashtag driven
I’m not hashtag driven
I’m not hashtag driven
I’m not hashtag driven

[Outro]
So lonely, you connect with your stalker
Had a pep in your step
When you knew you had a watcher
I’m not hashtag driven
I’m not hashtag driven
For you you got the fox
And for you, I forgot, I’ll be right back
I’m not hashtag driven
Before you drive, destress, be late, call ahead
A little courtesy goes a long way in a human head
I’m not hashtag driven
