[Verse 1]
She’s like a [?] queen full of worms
I saw her when I was at the bar
Patiently waiting my turn
She’s all like ‘look at me’
And I’m like staring at her boobs
Not so much out of attraction
But so much like a hornball mood
She sorta scared me to the point of saying hi
She looked at me like ‘I know you want this’
I had [?]
Just when I thought going to the bar alone sucks
Ms. Nipple Queen bought me a drink
I had to rethink my whole scheme

[Verse 2]
I’m not a man, I’m a broken kite
After she was [?] me with words
Like them other [?] that night
I didn’t say a word, I just sat still instead
She kept hitting me about the way I dressed
On the couch [?]
It got to my head after eight months
I drink eight cups of strong stuff
To stop the screaming that was so surreal
I went to the doctor
He gave me a hundred ninety pills
I took them the same night
And I was almost killed
Damn Ms. Nipple Queen
Why did I go to the bar that day alone?
Never wish I would have
I would never have been in this position I am now

[Verse 3]
My baby, she came to the hospital
Saying that I was the dumbest dude alive
She’s saying she had a feeling that I wouldn’t survive
Cause I was too weak
They had me in the hospital for two weeks
Constantly nagging me, telling me that it’s not cheap
I said I’m sorry, she told me ‘shut the fuck up’
She had sold all my valuable stuff
My baseball collection I started since I was eight
That painted plate my Dad gave me
When I was still his little ace
