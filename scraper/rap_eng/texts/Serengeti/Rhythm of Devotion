[Serengeti]
I don't care if you've been to Japan
I don't care if you've been to LA
I don't care if you've been to Tibet
I be right-right where you step
I put them peas on your plate
I put that drill in your drain
I put that shit in your thing
I put my head on your shoe
You put your hand on my back
I put your hand on my side
I feel more comfortable now [x3]
I don't care if you've been to Tibet
I don't care if you've been to LA
I don't care if you've been to Detroit
I be right-right where you stand [x6]
I be right-right-right-right-right-right where you stand
I don't care if you've been to LA
I don't care if you've been to Detroit
I don't care if you've been to Tibet
I be right-right where you step
I'll be that I and you're J [x2]
I don't give no fuck where you at
I don't give no fuck
I don't give no shit [x5]
I feel more comfortable now [x4]

[Sufjan]
This is how I want to love you
With an open heart
And an open hand
This is how I want to touch you
With an open heart
And an open hand
Nothing else will come between us
But an open heart
And an open hand
I don't care if you feel ugly
I've got an open heart
I wanna be your man
I can feel the rhythm of your heart

[Hook: Sufjan] (Serengeti)
Can you feel the rhythm of devotion?
(I be right-right where you step
I be right-right where you step
I'll be right back) [x3]
Can you feel the rhythm of devotion?
(I got your back)
I can feel the rhythm of your heart

[Sufjan] (Robot)
I can feel your heartbeat strongly
(I can feel the rhythm)
Under your open shirt
(I can feel the rhythm)
With the back of my hand
(I can feel the rhythm of your heart)
It's the feeling of devotion
(I can feel the rhythm)
Let me look at what it's worth
(I can feel the rhythm)
I wanna be your man
(I can feel the rhythm of your heart)
This
Is how I want to touch you
With an open heart
And an open hand
I don't care if you feel ugly
I've got an open heart
I wanna be your man
