One day I was walking down the street to my own drummer
When this fella walks up and said "D used to be a farmer."
No way Jose, ain't you heard of the Teachaz tapes?
You best get out my face before I make you extremely late
For your appointment, appointing you absent
This will make sure that you won't do that again
This will make sure you don't suggest to the KD's
That he should grow greens instead of crushing on MCs

All you need now is some direction
All you need now is some direction
Your whole damn category spread up in a section
All you need now is some direction

Now I can normally jog a mile in about 4:14
After about ten then I pick up a good wind
Started out in Skokie, now I'm near Evanston
Passin' by people, (Hey thanks for the cold wind!)
Until this one fella step up and says "D let's race"
I'm like "Sure buddy, tell me what's the stakes."
He said "5k," I said "done deal"
North Shore to Rainbow Beach see who has wheels
Ready, set, go and of course the D's won
Beat him by ten blocks watch how the money come
Look at the money come, look at the money come, look at the money come
I can look at the money come

Direction, direction, direction, direction...)
