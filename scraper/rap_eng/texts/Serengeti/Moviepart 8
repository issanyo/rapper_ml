[Verse]
My whole lifetime
It hasn’t been the straightest line
Back against the wall
And I ain’t even do the crime
And I ain’t doing time
Thirsty wolves and they out for blood
Once they break through the door
Then I’m spitting slugs
I’d rather walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Then let another man treat me with disrespect
I’m not ready to die going out without a fight
I’ve got a ticket to hell, you’re going with me tonight
I’m not a bad man, just got a bad hand
Every outlaw has a last stand
Trials and tribulations [?]
Convicted of a crime, the wrong man
Thirty years away in the can
Can hear somebody coming up, loading the clip
Palms sweaty and shaky, I think ‘mama, this it’
It’s a cold, cold world, some of us don’t fit
You’re either born to survive
Or get eaten alive
In the modern penetentiary
Bloody money and weaponary
Bow down to my enemy
Trying to put the death in me
Crabs up in the barrel
With so little denaro
So all hail in the thievery
The devil sink his teeth in me
[?]
Packed up in here like animals
Street turns us into cannibals
[?]
Police dog is mechanical
Metal teeth are your mandible
Eating you like a cantaloupe
Stuck here without the antidote
Stuck here without the antidote
