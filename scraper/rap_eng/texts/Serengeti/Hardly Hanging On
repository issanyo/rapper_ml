[Sufjan]
Yeah I'm still alone
Breathing on the floor
And I look just like a baby
And I feel just like a dog
It was my choice
It was my first thought
You can read it in my waiver
You can hear it in my prayer
You can feel it in my soul
It was my choice
The life that I create
I am nothing to you
I am nothing to you
And I may look just like a baby
And I may feel just like a dog
It may not look just like I'm fading
It may not look just like I'm fading

But I am hardly hanging on [x4]
It was my choice [x6]
But I am hardly hanging on
