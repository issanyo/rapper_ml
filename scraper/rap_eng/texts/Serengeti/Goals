[Jerry G]
People under one common goal
It’s unstoppable
I’m into politics
I show you what a [?] can do
Get the [?] out their heart
That’s what a Glock can do
Mobilise men like Shaka Zulu

[Serengeti]
At the pool like bikini bottoms
[?] bottoms
Women with some beer
And I’m [?]
Wild staring, stay vacation
Chicago city stressing patience
Lay around pacing
Oh my god, oh my god
[?]

[Jerry G]
Rearrange they thinking
Make them move on principles
The change help them realise
Together they invincible
Now that’s the power
I’m learning every hour
My words fall
With the force of the trade towers

[Serengeti]
[?] on the cue
8 ball, reverse the english
8 ball till eight
The weather’s great
Plus the kegs going
And plus the bra bra’s showing
And plus I’m giddy
Plus there’s no more feeling shitty
All the time we in it

Take the colour out the rap game
Make it black and blanco
Jerry and Serengeti

Add some colour to the crap game

[Jerry G]
[?] written
I’m the true and living
Trying to get up out this V8
Improve my engine
Trying to drink me some V8
Improve my system
My body’s a temple
My word is the religion

[Serengeti]
Jerry told you about forces
I’ma tell you about whores and Porsches
I’ma sing a song about divorces
And leave you [?]
My take on rap is funny honey
How your girl blow me homie
You don’t know me

[Jerry G]
You don’t know me
[?]
Gotta [?]
Make you crawl to save them
Had to learn to live with bad decisions
Now I’m trying to make your brain crack
Like bad collisions

[Serengeti]
Serengeti, [?]
I shot the Lone Ranger and freed Tonto
I move to Queens and kill [?]
I move pronto like a ninja from [?]
You unfortunate like animals up on the roadway

Jerry G, Serengeti
F5 Records
It’s your boy [?]
DJ Crucial on the ones and twos
Do it like this man, let it go

[Interlude]
The smallest to the tallest
Barren flesh
A test for all of us
Broken voices span the cityscape
Screaming for a heated plate
Sleeping on a heated grate
My knees are getting shakey
My thoughts are soon to break me
A patron of what’s [?]
