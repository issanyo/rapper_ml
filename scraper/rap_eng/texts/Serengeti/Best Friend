[Intro]
This song’s dedicated to my best friend

[Verse 1]
[?]
Sensitive schoolboy turned thug
Turned drug dealer
He was spoiled rotten yo
[?] in your own shit
You ain’t victorious
And get [?] and say yeah
I’m doing some real shit now
Go ahead loser
Shoot the stuff for the sake of fronting
Yeah, that’s real good
[?] in your own image
Jealous rotten
Fronting fakie sissy what a life
Decline your type
I think the nation should too
You played a role in [?]
Fronting [?] switch your pitch
I thought a person’s supposed to stand firm
Slippery worm like snakes
Got a bite yo, knuckle down, head up
Bring your gun back and blast the whole setup
You claim [?], you claim karma
You ain’t no honour
You sissy fool, sensitive
Wanna be thug [?]
Besides, who wanna be a thug?
Type of cat [?] your CDs and tapes
And claim they got over
Smoke too many blunts back to back
But don’t eat beef
This, that, [?] for highschoolers
Little sisters and daughters and [?]
Are the weakminded sheep that keep it
Keep it wrong, overwhelmed by fitting in

[Hook]
Ain’t no snakes allowed yo
Ain’t no snakes allowed
Ain’t no snakes allowed
It’s dedicated to my best friend
Ain’t no snakes allowed up in here
This is house of the new times
Living for the higher stuff now
Ain’t no snakes allowed
Ain’t no snakes allowed
Ain’t no snakes allowed

[Outro]
Peace to BLT, Joey J
My girl Caitlyn and Lucy
Plus Simon and BLT
Peace to my guy Shane
Plus my man Dwayne
Plus [?]
All my cats
Ain’t no snakes allowed
Dedicated to my best friend, yeah
Peace to [?] and Simon
Don’t forget Dwayne
Don’t forget [?]
Don’t forget Snake
Don’t forget Joey J
Yeah, ain’t no snakes allowed
Ain’t no snakes allowed, yeah
Rock it rock it rock it
