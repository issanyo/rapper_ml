[Hook: Sufjan Stevens] [x2]
Love, take me to your room
I wanna be your friend

[Verse 1: Sufjan]
Will you walk me home at night?
Will you send me showers of light?
I wanna be your friend
Will you kiss me on the lips?
Will you fill my lunar eclipse?
I wanna be your friend
Will you touch me in the car?
Will you say that I am your star?
I wanna be your friend
And will you keep me safe from harm?
Will you hold me close in your arms?
I wanna be your friend

[Hook: Sufjan] [x2]
Love, take me to your room
I wanna be your friend

[Verse 2: Sufjan]
And I have no appetite
And I cannot sleep through the night
I wanna be your friend
I‘ve got pictures in my head
Only thought of you in my bed
I wanna be your friend
With the terror you may find
For I fear I’m losing my mind
I wanna be your friend
And my heart is such a mess
And I feel that I am possessed
I wanna be your friend

[Hook: Sufjan] [x5]
Love, take me to your room
I wanna be your friend
