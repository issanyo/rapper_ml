[Spoken lyrics]

She poke it, looking back at it
She touching on me
And I'm touching on her, too
Tryna give her this, yeah, I give her this
Yeah, she want this, she can get this
Yeah, I give her this
Yeah, she want this, she gonna get this

Excuse my liquor
She wants something new and she wanna get it from me
The long way, ain't it
Baby, you a bad, bad, drinking on these bottles
Getting ratchet
This your girl, she with you
But she tryna find out what it do

Watch your girl cause she might just get down
Down, down
Many girls yeah, it ain't different

She poke it, looking back at it
She touching on me
And I'm touching on her, too
Tryna give her this, yeah, I give her this
Yeah, she want this, she gonna get this
Yeah, I give her this
Yeah, she want this, she gonna get this

She want her new
Cause she don't wanna mess with you no more
The long way, ain't it
They feeling on her body
She drinking in this party, getting naughty
If this your girl, if this your baby momma
Get her cause I don't want no drama

Watch your girl cause she might just get down
Down, down
Many girls yeah, it ain't different

She poke it, looking back at it
She touching on me
And I'm touching on her, too
Tryna give her this, yeah, I give her this
Yeah, she want this, she gonna get this
Yeah, I give her this
Yeah, she want this, she gonna get this

Watch your girl cause she might just get down
Down, down
Many girls yeah, it ain't different
Watch your girl cause she might just get down
Down, down
Many girls yeah, it ain't different
Watch your girl cause she might just get down
Down, down
Many girls yeah, it ain't different

She poke it, looking back at it
She touching on me
And I'm touching on her, too
Tryna give her this, yeah, I give her this
Yeah, she want this, she gonna get this
Yeah, I give her this
Yeah, she want this, she can get this
