[Verse 1]
Lord forget my ways, please forgive my homies
That refuse to spend they days, broke and lonely
Some girls do it all to control me
Knowin they the one when it’s gone to console me
Shout out to the white chicks 7-Up n stolly
I love how you ride dick, to this you can hold me
Symbol of excellence, yeah I am the trophy
Niggas in the wilderness, hunting for the holy
The one and only, rose and single 5’s
On the search for a slit, I ain’t hitting the wild
They couple of runners, with a nigga style
Got a fatboy stomach, and a bigger mouth
Less bigger out, but the 5 men get a bigger house
It’s bitches out, pull the benzes out
My friends is out, on a Sunday
For fellowship, handling grip, all is one pray

(Hook)
Our father, who are in heaven
Let me get money, 7 eleven
7, 7 eleven, 7 eleven
Let me get money, 7 eleven

[Verse 2]
I’m drifting and I’m driving, in my special place to go
Got a bag of that hypnotic that’s the most expensive drough
Yeah you are not invited to the most exciting show
In the world, we blessed and be about your dough
If I said it once I ain’t gonn front
Yeah I meant it, what you want
Come and get it, start that shit
We gonn finish, yeah the street
Life will have a nigga heart
Black as guiness like we get it
I’m about my money
Plenty benefits in lab man
Sweets at the MGM gram
Smokin head man, the homies who keep missin the plan
Stuck in the fed camp
Keepin the stacks on the commisary
Watchin comedy central on the blackberry
Fresh as a mad berry club quite legendary
Bring the light to the dark, the night’s necessary
That’s when the freaks come out, the gigs too
I’m one and the same nigga, I G you

[Hook]
