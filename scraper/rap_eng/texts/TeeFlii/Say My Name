[Verse 1]
You know how I like it girl
No you never, you never, act funny with me
You don’t let these chick violate your space
You ain’t taking no, you ain’t taking no for an answer
You got it too so slow
Like I’m going for a lay up
Aim one, fire one, give me my free-throws
Girl don’t play, girl don’t play around
I eat it, eat it, I don’t apologise
Girl you’re looking right, I like the way you shine
Wanna make you mine
Baby you and I been on my mind, on my mind
Annie you body, you body you get it
You get it get, and I get it get it

[Pre-Chorus]
I see that you ain’t worried bout no lover, you just wanna be fucked
You like how I do that, how I give it to ya
We flirt with each other, I’m tryna take this further

[Chorus]
If you want it then call my name
If you bout it then say my name
If you want it then call my name
If you bout it then say my name

Money and cars, that ain’t everything to you
A star to us, that ain’t everything t you
You like what I like, Annie yeah
Hail Mary, I know that you gon’ catch it
You’ve been twerking girl, you’ve been working all day
Girl come get this, come get this
You with the business baby, you ain’t shy
I’ll pull your panties to the side
You want this flii’n’b thug
And I get it get it

[Pre-Chorus]
I see that you ain’t worried bout no lover, you just wanna be fucking
You like how I do that, how I give it to you
We flirt with each other, but I’m tryna take this further

[Chorus]
If you want it then call my name
If you bout it then say my name
If you want it then call my name
If you bout it then say my name

[Verse 3]
I call you the baddest bitch, play some
You just keep putting on, the city they love you
If you want it then call my name
Girl keep making me proud
