(Chorus):
I see you peekin’, but you ain't speakin’
Checkin’ ain't cheatin’
Fat ass and big titties she ready
Annie known to get it she ready
She bend over and touch her toes, touch her toes
She’s that ride or die type of chick, hell yea she’s ready

(Verse 1):
You pay attention to the wrong shit
Asking who I’m on the phone with
I'm just tryna see how that thong fit
She can feel it in her chest like a bong rip
Tryna slide up out the spot before the song switch
She got a walk that let me know she ready
Leggings on I can see it from the front that's how i know its heavy
She got a body make you spend it all
Weather vacation or in the mall she know that we finna ball
A lot goin’ on but i try not to miss her call
She get a little and get my all not finna crawl
Ima stroll like a pimp wit some gators on
You can be loud as you want i think the neighbors gone
Cut all the lights off in the crib leave the cable on
To get her naked I promise its not gone take me long
I see you peakin’  I see you lookin’ you can’t help it
I wish it was only for me I’m so damn selfish

Chorus:
I see you peekin’, but you ain't speakin’
Checkin’ ain't cheatin’
Fat ass and big titties she ready
Annie known to get it she ready
She bend over and touch her toes, touch her toes
She’s that ride or die type of chick, hell yea she’s ready

(Verse 2):
She more ready than she ever been
Now I got her ready to try shit
Even gave her some of my medicine
She don’t really smoke but she roll up
Foreign in the parkin lot doin doughnuts nigga I glowed up
Channel her favorite red bottoms ain't nothin basic
Emillio Pucci Gucci she in the latest
If I go down she ain't never gone sign a statement
If I go down i promise I’m just tryna taste it
Her style got these other hoes copyin’ her clothes
Got picked up in the 'rarri got dropped off in the Rolls
Ain't never have to strip but she a natural on the pole
She be laughin’ to the bank see how she laughin’ when she pose
Weather change matchin’ Moncler jacket when it get cold
Dime piece not a 5, 6, or a 7
You want her to yourself she partyin’ got you stressin’
Girls they just wanna have fun you’ll learn ya lesson

Chorus:
I see you peekin’, but you ain't speakin’
Checkin’ ain't cheatin’
Fat Ass and big titties she ready
Annie known to get it she ready
She bend over and touch her toes, touch her toes
She’s that ride or die type of chick, hell yea she’s ready
