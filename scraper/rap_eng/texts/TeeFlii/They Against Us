[Chorus 1: TeeFlii]
Girl I'm just being honest
You believe anything you hear from anybody

A hater

Fuck em' if they ain't with us they against us
Girl
They against us
Fuck em' if they ain't with us they against us

Ohh
They ain't wit us, they against us


[Verse 1: Tee Flii]
Ahh
Tasha with the big booty
She know what to do to me
But now you playin' with her cootie cootie
Feelin' on my (feelin' on my) woody woody

Both bad than a muthafucka
Know they want this D like a muhfucka
Now they all tripping on each other
They know imma put that tongue in


[Chorus 2:TeeFlii]
Girl we off this shit
Off this shit
Yeah we off this shit
Off this shit

[Chorus 1]


[Verse 2: Tee Flii]
Ahh
Annie, I can give it to you but what you go do with it?
Bounce for a nigga you know I can handle it
Why other Annie's they all be lustin'?
Still quick to treat a nigga like it's nothin'

Me an my Annie only wearin J's
Other singers happy them niggas is gay
Annie tellin' her nigga she don't need him
We be with that (we be with that) foreplay


[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1 x2]


[Verse 3: SBA1]
Yeah that
Everything I do girl you acting like you new to this
You my Cinderella I'm just looking for the shoe that fit
And I don't want to do this Annie girl cause we been through this shit
But when it come to stuff you fuckin' crazy girl you Ludacris
But I ain't never met a girl like you
Never nah
I swear you make me feel so comfortable
And I don't even trip off wearing condoms when I fuck with you
Them other bitches they just shit to do when it ain't shit to do
Straight up we fight then we make up
You bomb already Annie you don't need the make-up
Huh
Bitches now about SB, prolly take her down listening to Oak Tell Treat [?]


[Chorus 1]
