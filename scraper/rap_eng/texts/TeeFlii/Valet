[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
I'm tryna talk to you but the music too loud
Girl, I know a quiet place where we can vibe out
I ain't like your ex, you can let your guard down
Tell your girls you're with a real one, so they can come down
Oh yeah, they can come down
They sayin' I'm the nigga, that's the word around town
Oh yeah, that's the word around town
If you didn't know before, then I bet you know now

[Pre-Hook: Eric Bellinger]
Baby, you got everything that a nigga want
I just wanna put you on
And I just wanna see you with them Vickie's on
Better yet, with them off

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
Oh, let's ride out
(You got everything that a nigga want)
Oh, let's ride out
(You got everything that a nigga want)
Yeah, I got the car outside if you ready
(If you with it)
Only if you ready
Tell them valet niggas go and get it
(Go and get it)
Only if you ready
(Oh she ready)

[Verse 2: Teeflii]
My driver know that you a freak
Introduce you to my back seat
Pour my drink, roll my weed
If you really fuckin' with me
Girl, throw it back, look back at it
If you want a Flii n' B thug
Sex so good, now you attached to me
Oh, fuck it, we do it, 69

[Pre-Hook: Eric Bellinger]
Baby, you got everything that a nigga want
I just wanna put you on
And I just wanna see you with them Vickie's on
Better yet, with them off

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
Oh, let's ride out
(You got everything that a nigga want)
Oh, let's ride out
(You got everything that a nigga want)
Yeah, I got the car outside if you ready
(If you with it)
Only if you ready
Tell them valet niggas go and get it
(Go and get it)
Only if you ready
(Oh she ready)

[Verse 3: Pleasure P]
They say time is money
And I ain't spendin' mine
On a girl who gon' drink my shit
And go home with another nigga
Got me fucked up, so don't even try
If you're comin' and you're cuttin', ain't no need to line
I wanna eat it right now, pull 'em to the side
But that's only if you get in my ride
I know you a freak on the low
Let's put on a show, for the walls in my bedroom
Pickin' all the berries to go 'cause we gotta go
And that's how bad I want you

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
Oh, let's ride out
(You got everything that a nigga want)
Oh, let's ride out
(You got everything that a nigga want)
Yeah, I got the car outside if you ready
(If you with it)
Only if you ready
Tell them valet niggas go and get it
(Go and get it)
Only if you ready
(Oh she ready)
