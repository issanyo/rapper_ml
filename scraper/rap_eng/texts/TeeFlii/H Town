H town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt
Keep that H town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt
Keep that H town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt
Keep that H town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt

Bitch I’m makin moves, 6 on 22’s
Walk inside my house, all you see is views
Flat screens on the wall, white folks in the hall
Make 100 racks and tell my bitch to count it all
It was us against the odds til niggas played they cards
All we did was ball, look how they did my dog
All these pretty broads, all these foreign cars
Made a grip to lose it all, it was the rise before the fall
But I’m still going
H town in my cup, kush still blowin
Strike my nggas up, they know it’s still rollin
Crenshaw on my shirt, they see they boy blowin

Every time that I go, niggas know that I go off
Pull up in that white Benz, yea baby I’mma show off
And all my niggas salute me, like a nigga was Adolf
Hitler, you better hide yo bitch ‘cause I’ll get her, I’ll get her
Nigga and I bet you you'll miss her, I don’t want her
But if a nigga did then she a goner
But man I’mma gonna hit a corner
Take a hit of this weed and sippin some of this pour up
Got niggas salty at me ‘cus yo dream bitch is my main slut
These diamonds heavy on me and yo baby mama she wanna fuck
Her home girl Tiffany, nigga you know she wanna come
Come and roll with me, what you call that? A threesome

Tell er it’s my turn and watch the girl get turnt on
Some zig zags and OG, it’s time to get my burn on
I make er shake that ass but she ain’t have no shirt on
I do it just like Pac, nigga I ain’t had no shirt on
My money come in lumps, love only come once
You the nigga she got
But I’m the nigga she want
I told er leave on the pumps
‘cus it’s a perfect occasion
Her body lookin amazing and my pockets looking Caucasian
And you niggas salty at me but I’ll slap yo face off
Then I'll buy yo job, then you gonna get laid off
Make 35 million, then I’m just gon shade off
By 2015, nigga I be paid off
‘Cuz

Purple all in my bitch, money up and just lift
Slow paper, off spit
Get mo paper off pitch
Got a hublot on my wrist, bad bitch on my dick
Cartiers on my eyes and got my clear sight on my grip
It’s that Dom Cobby and Nip
Add me on i'm here
That west side still the best side, got a mack 11 on hip
I sip that same shit that killed Pimp
Same shit that killed Skru
Got these dollars split with my crew
Plus we stay shittin PU
PS, we just, the best, Khaled
That’s that Louie, that’s Cliquot, Balenciagas and Ballys
This that pistolss and palm trees, my palm raise a profit
Saw that west side and then locked it
Got yo girl heart in my pocket, word
