You're sending naked pictures
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
You live so far away
But you make a nigga want it
But that shit tempting
I ain't gon' lie, I ain't gon' lie
That shit's tempting
I'mma take that drive, take that drive
That shit tempting

[Verse 1: Rayven Justice]
I see you want this D on the late night
Want me to give what you want, what you need right
I'mma beat it, beat it up like a street fight
I might just do it
Just send the car and do it movin'
That's how bad I want it
Why do you live so far? God damn
I need your body
It's so damn tempting
Havin' all these pics you sendin'
But you're so damn far from me

That shit's tempting
I'mma take that drive, take that drive
That shit's tempting

[Verse 2: TeeFlii]
Pimpin' ain't easy, but somebody gotta do it
Take her to the back, put her hands on the wall, give it to her
She gon' make someone happy, make someone happy
She gon' do tricks with her body
She pull up in the foreign
Late nights, early mornings
She gon' do it every time
Bet she wanna come back

[Verse 3: Tk-N-Ca$h]
Say I'm rollin' on 284
Yeah I'm ridin' in a circle
She keep callin' but I won't reply
But them curves make me never wanna swerve her
I might just pull up and do it
Say she from Houston, she loud when she screw me
Send all these naked pics, plus she no groupie
But she call me Ca$h, she say she love my music
Hey, say she ain't committed, ain't no ring on
Said 3 times in a row, that's her ring tone
And I go ape up in that pussy, ain't no King Kong
She call me young dollar, say she can't leave me alone
