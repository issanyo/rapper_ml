[Hook: Rayven Justice]
You're sending naked pictures
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
You live so far away
But you make a nigga want it
But that shit's tempting
I ain't gon' lie, I ain't gon' lie
That shit's tempting
I'mma take that drive, take that drive
That shit's tempting

[Verse 1: Rayven Justice]
I see you want this D on the late night
Want me to give what you want, what you need right
I'mma beat it, beat it up like a street fight
I might just do it
Just sit in the car and do it movin'
That's how bad I want it
Why do you live so far? God damn
I need your body
It's so damn tempting
Havin' all this pics you sendin'
But you're so damn far from me

I ain't gon' lie, I ain't gon' lie
That shit's tempting
I'mma take that drive, take that drive
That shit's tempting

[Verse 2: TeeFlii]
Pimpin' ain't easy but somebody gotta do it
Take her to the back, put her hands on the wall, give it to her
She gon' make some happy, make some happy
She gon' do tricks with that body
She pull up in the foreign
Late nights, early mornings
She gon' do it every time
Bet she wanna come back

[Verse 3: Jonn Hart]
I want you like a  fat boy want cake
Been no whip, hit the bar, [?] highway (skurr!)
I got that Netflix code them on the way
And we could just chill all day
5 in the morning, I'm yawning
But I gonna still have you moaning
Until the crack of dawn and
Can't control in no more conversation
You keep screaming like yo' mama in home, man
When I get that text
You know I'm on my way
So don't you get chill, then mad, ohh
