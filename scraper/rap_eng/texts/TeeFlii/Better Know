[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
It's like fucking four girls on the 4th of July
South central niggas, I ain't never told you lies
I make 'em choose sides, OpM 'til I die
Fucking with that westside, nigga bump that TeefLii
Seat is on recline, I told her: "say what's on your mind"
She calling nigga daddy, I'm finna turn 29
Know that's that baller shit
I'm on some "take-my-number-down-but-don't-call-it" shit
On my EML, alcoholic shit
Fuck that Ciroc, I told her shake it for some beer
Her nigga disappeared when I whispered in her ear
Been fucking her for years but never took her to the pier
Fuck it, I might just buy her a car every year

[Bridge: TeeFLii]
The turn up is real over here
Oh yeah
You ain't never felt like this, like this
We can see each other in the mirror
In the mirror girl, girl
I can see that you've been practicing
On the way you move
Your body
Body
You naughty

[Hook: TeeFLii]
Annie your body is
Calling
For me
I hear it calling girl
Annie your body is
Calling
For me
If you want me
Annie, let me know
And I will kiss and touch on your body
You better know, better know
Beg you to know, better know
You better know my sex game is real, Annie
Yeah, you better know
Beg you to know
Better know, better know
My sex game is
Better know my sex game is real, Annie

[Verse 2: TeeFLii]
Smoking with you Annie
You fucks with me the long way
You know that
Ain't no time for games
It ain't no time for games, no, no
Annie throw it back and then look back at it
Then I'm gonna beat it up...
Annie...

[Hook]
Annie your body is
