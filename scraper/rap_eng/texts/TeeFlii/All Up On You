[Chorus]
Calling me, calling me daddy
Naughty you naughty girl
Knew I was all on your body
Cause by the end of the night
Annie I was all up on you
I was all up on you
I was all up on you
I was all up on you

[Verse 1]
Young nigga bout to give it to you, girl you got it
Yeah I heard about the things you like to do
Girl, baby you so fine, I cannot deny you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come one baby, talk dirty to me
Come on baby, talk dirty to me
Come on baby, talk dirty to me

[Chorus]
Calling me, calling me daddy
Naughty you naughty girl
Knew I was all on your body
Cause by the end of the night
Annie I was all up on you
I was all up on you
I was all up on you
I was all up on you

[Verse 2]
Show me what you’re working with
Cause I’ma give it to you girl, just be patient
You got that right thing, you that right thing
And no need to be insecure

[Pre-Chorus]
Come one baby, talk dirty to me
Come one baby, talk dirty to me
Come one baby, talk dirty to me

[Chorus]
Calling me, calling me daddy
Naughty you naughty girl
Knew I was all on your body
Cause by the end of the night
Annie I was all up on you
I was all up on you
