[Verse 1]
Annie if I had every woman in the world
You'd still be number one
[?] Lord knows that I'm managing my best to stick it out with you
You only get one chance to love
So you better love right
See, I can't wait for you anymore, girl

[Pre-Hook]
It ain't nowhere to pray, nowhere to hide
It ain't no wrong, it ain't no right

[Hook]
Oh, you say it's love over money
But I say it's money over love
Cause you and I acting like we don't give a fuck
You say it's love over money
But I say it's money over love
And you and I seem to have a reason we can't trust

[Verse 2]
You say you really don't give a fuck, you only want to love me
You want to talk about how you're going to faithful to me
It's tearing you down, it's tearing you up
I know because, because every day you be calling me, calling me
You need to give a little or give your all
'Cause every single time that you leave
I know that you, that you be coming back (Hell yeah!)
Annie

Everytime you get mad (everytime you get mad), that's when you say it's over (Over)
