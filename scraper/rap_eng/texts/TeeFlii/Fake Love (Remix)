[Dj Carisma]

[Intro]
Uh-uh
Say what, say what, say what?
Oooooo

[Hook]
He don't even know me
Acting like he want me
Good girl gone bad
Getting nasty with you
Middle fingers to the one's that be hatin'
Roll up like a joint let me smoke with ya

I won't put no stress on ya
Running my fingers through your dreads
I'm always there for ya
Let me, I'm ready

I'm down, down, down
Yeah
You know what it is (what it is)
(I don't like it) and I don't like it
You say you got all this feeling
But your actions ain't convincing me

Turn me up, don't turn me down
You don't want me
Don't be acting clueless
You know this is true shit
I just act like I don't care
'Cause you be on that bullshit
I don't need to prove it
I could act less, but instead I'm on some cool shit

[Hook]
He don't even know me
Acting like he own me
Good, gone bad
Gettin' nasty with you
Middle fingers to the one's that be hatin'
Roll up like the joy and let me smoke with ya

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll put no stress on ya
Running my fingers to your dress
I'm always there for you
Let me baby, I'm ready

I'm down, down (down, down)
It is what it is

It is, what it is, oh girl
