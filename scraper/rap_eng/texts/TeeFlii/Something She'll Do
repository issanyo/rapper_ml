[Intro (Skeme)]
He like damn flames, we just warming up
I'm like fuck that lil' bro, set fire to 'em!
Lil' baby pussy been A-1 since day one
You already know that, yeah
And she got ass by the pound, she should be on a mound
I said throw that

[Verse 1]
She been A-1 since I met her
She gon' stir me up if i let her
I told her, if she want it she can get it right here
And I whispered in my ear while I'm up in it
Hands all on her belly, her eyes are [?] to the back of her hair
She said she down for whatever, however, whenever

[Pre-Hook 1]
I'm gon' put it down, give her what she need
So she make it bounce right in front of me
And it hold me down when she in the streets

[Pre-Hook 2]
Her sex, her sex
Her sex is fire, fire, fire, fire
Her sex, her sex, her sex is fire

[Hook]
Yeah this is something she'll do, something she'll do
She climbing on top of me, yeah she get the best of me
Cause that's something she'll do, something she'll do

[Verse 3 (Skeme)]
Lil' baby pussy been A-1 since day one
You already know that
And she got ass by the pound, she should be on a mound
I said throw that
I wanna murk it, it look picture perfect
Like damn man this here is a Kodak
She got that fire; I don't even smoke
But I might split a swisher and roll that
I might even pass to the homie like you gotta get it
Tell her drive it, get it, gotta watch
When she get to popping with it I just hop up in there
Switch position, man, I gotta get on top
She got that run it, that come back
That wet with the water fountain, man, I want that
She got that flight; it's so tight and so right

[Bridge]
Her sex is fire, fire, fire, fire
Her sex, her sex, her sex is fire

[Hook]
