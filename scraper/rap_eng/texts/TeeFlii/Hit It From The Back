[Hook: TeeFlii]

You, your body looking right
I'm trying to fuck with you
You know what I wanna do
Let me hit it from the back
Let me hit it from the back
If you want it girl then let me
Hit it from the back
Can I hit it from the back?

[Verse 1: TeeFlii]

Annie get it, get it, get it
Your hair, sweat it out
Get with it, get with it
Take it down low, low
Whoa, Annie wanna fuck with a real one
That's just what she wants
She can't stop thinking about
Ridin' up and down on me, on me
Ridin' up and down on me, on me
Ridin' up and down on me, on me
Ridin' up and down on me

[Hook: TeeFlii]

[Verse 2: TeeFlii]

Annie get it, get it, get it
Girl work it out
Get with it, get with it
Bend over touch your toes
Whoa, Annie that body's on fire
I wouldn't never deny you
Girl all you gonna be thinking about is
Ridin' up and down on me, on me
Ridin' up and down on me, on me
Ridin' up and down on me, on me
Ridin' up and down on me

[Hook: TeeFlii]

[Verse 3: Skeme]

She don't kiss and tell I can do my thing with her
She with all the turn-ups let the gang get her
Say her nigga do it good I do it way better
Gimme that pussy I'mma beat it like Mayweather
Aye, 12 rounds in a ring like a prize fight
Check the Rollie I'm just trynna get the time right
Lean in my cup, ass in my lap
Told her I don't ever front I'd rather smash from the back
She like "fuck them other niggas" cause she want a real nigga
I could have her bustin' like my finger on the trigger
Tell a bitch don't come if she ain't with the business
Murder that pussy, call a judge and a witness
