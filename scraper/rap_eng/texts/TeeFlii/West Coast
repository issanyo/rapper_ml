[Hook]
Cake and soda, I got cake and soda
Cake and soda, I got cake and soda
Whip it through the glass, nigga
Yeah I'm blowin' money fast, nigga
I'm in love with the West Coast
I'm in love with the West Coast
See my record hit 400 racks
Now I'm in love with the West Coast
West Coast, West Coast
I'm in love with the West Coast
West Coast, West Coast
I'm in love with the West Coast

[Verse]
I take your girl out, she is my type
She might be broke but she can get fixed
Gon' come home with me tonight
I'm the reason you actin' a fool
High heels and a dress
I wanna give it to you all night
Fuck with my team

[Hook]
