[Verse 1: Sba1]
Ladies love me on some Cool J shit
Nigga tryna get it, that’s just everyday shit
I’ve been earned stripes nigga, fuck a case win
Bad and you know it, you ain’t even gotta say shit
And fuck them other bitches
They ain’t bad enough so baby they don’t fit the picture
You all on me, I’m all on you
You could get it when you want it, baby fall on you
Told that bitch to run it, everything is 100
We fuckin’ but ain’t no covering
Excuse my liquor, we coming for you
Fuck niggas
Real nigga, whole squad full of go-getters
Fuck you hoes back then didn’t wanna fuck with us

[Verse 2: Teeflii]
Some more of it, I giver his D now she in love with it
Tell the DJ play your favorite record
Cause I do it better, you say nobody don’t do it like me
Fuckin’ with the one woman
You threw it with the right so I caught it with the left hand

[Pre-Chorus: Teeflii]
Girl you gonna bend it over for me
I’ma take you home and take care of you all night
Kissing all on me, biting and scratching all on me
Girl was doing a lot of shit she ain’t never did

[Chorus: Teeflii]
And I could bang dat
Told her relax girl, just lay back
Say I could bang dat
Playing with he [?] and she couldn’t control me
I could bang dat, I could bang dat, I could bang dat
She let her nigga make her body money
And I could bang dat

[Verse 3: Teeflii]
Smikoin’ OG, but she knew better, boy she do better
In my own section standing on the table
You gon’ see my team go HAM
Annie let em keep looking
As long as they ain’t touching we ain’t getting cracking
Fucking with a real one, that’s for sure

[Pre-Chorus: Teeflii]
Girl you gonna bend it over for me
I’ma take you home and take care of you all night
Kissing all on me, biting and scratching all on me
Girl was doing a lot of shit she ain’t never did

[Chorus: Teeflii]
And I could bang dat
Told her relax girl, just lay back
Say I could bang dat
Playing with he [?] and she couldn’t control me
I could bang dat, I could bang dat, I could bang dat
She let her nigga make her body money
And I could bang dat
