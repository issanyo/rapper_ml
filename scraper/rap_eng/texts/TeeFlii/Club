[Verse 1: Keekdasneak]
I’m on that bumper like the license plate, tail lights
Talking that shit, you gotta show tonight
I’m mr come through get it lit, we show you a ride
Pigeon toe thick, nice tits, no overbite

[Pre-Chorus: Teeflii]
Girl, what up, let me see you turn up
You claiming she your girl but you don’t know her
Baddest in the club and I’ma show her
You damn right

[Chorus: Teeflii]
Before she leave the club everybody gon’ know about her
Before she leave this club everybody gon’ know about her
Before she leave this club everybody gon’ know about her
Before she leave this club everybody gon’ know about her

[Verse 2: Teeflii]
I don’t know her, I just met her
She gon’ lay me, she ready, Annie ready
If you don’t know I’m fuckin’ with your body
Annie let me feel all on your body
For keeps, we play, I can hit the switch hydraulics
Fuck them niggas acting like snitches
Pop that pussy for the hood through
No losers, we winning
Bet you Annie wanna be on this team
She gon’ leave you cause your broke
And your ass don’t look like money

[Pre-Chorus: Teeflii]

You claiming she your girl but you don’t know her
Baddest in the club and I’ma show her
You damn right

[Chorus: Teeflii]
Before she leave the club everybody gon’ know about her
Before she leave this club everybody gon’ know about her
Before she leave this club everybody gon’ know about her
Before she leave this club everybody gon’ know about her

[Verse 3: Keekdasneak]
I’m on that bumper like the license plate, tail lights

Pigeon toe thick, nice tits, no overbite
Tonight before we leave, they gon' know about
Showing up, I’m showing in then I’m showing out

Double up the the chair, fill up in her mouth
Business in the front, party in the back

[Pre-Chorus: Teeflii]
Girl, what up, let me see you turn up
You claiming she your girl but you don’t know her
Baddest in the club and I’ma show her

[Chorus: Teeflii]

Before she leave this club everybody gon’ know about her
Before she leave this club everybody gon’ know about her
Before she leave this club everybody gon’ know about her
