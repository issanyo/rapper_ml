[Intro: YG]
Girl, he got your money
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Verse 1: Bobby Shmurda]
Then I ask her what she waiting for, called my phone then
She told me that she 24, going grown
Then I ask her what she tripping for, I get my own
And my mama she don't live at home, I bought her Rome
Thick thigh little pretty ho
And I be getting high when she getting low
You should see her hips slide when she on the pole
So I'ma go and get miles 'fore I hit the dough
Girl, I got 24 hours
Girl, pop that, pop that
When I say start don't stop that, stop that
Let a hot nigga hit it
You gon' be addicted when a hot nigga get it, huh

[Bridge: TeeFLii]
Girl, don't hide it from me
You should be the type to provide it to me (To me)
And let a thug hit it (This is the remix)
You ain't gotta get dressed or do your hair

[Chorus: TeeFLii]
Girl, I got 24 hours, 24 hours
It's just me and you, I got 24 hours
24 hours, 24 hours
You won't have nothing on for 24 hours

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla Sign]

[Verse 3: TeeFLii]
Walking around, combing your hair
And you know that I want it right here, yeah, yeah!

[Chorus: TeeFLii]
Girl, I got 24 hours, 24 hours
It's just me and you, I got 24 hours
