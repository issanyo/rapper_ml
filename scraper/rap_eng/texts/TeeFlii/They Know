[Intro]

Annie everybody knows
Your body, your body
Roll it up, light it
Smoke it, Annie exhale
Let me pull out on your ponytail
Aw yeah, all them other Annies gon' lie
But Annie don't be surprised
Don't change your mind Annie
Excuse some of mine, all of mine (?) girl
But anyone we got they want

[Verse 1]

We ain't humping we fucking
I'm giving you the D just how you want it
We getting loaded all damn night
Girl you love this thug shit

[Bridge]

Just keep giving me the best that you got
And you keep giving me the best that you got
Girl, cause they gon' hate on you and me
Because they wanna see us fall apart
You can't be believing their lies
Cause you're just the Annie that I like

[Hook]

And they know, they know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know, they know

[Verse 2]

Get it Annie, pop a molly
Turn me up, girl do it right there
You got me, you got me, Annie
You got me, thinking about taking you down
Girl I trying to see how you gon' ride me
If you don't know then shame on you
We could do it in the shower
Back and forth we going for hours
Haters they don't like what we do
That's why we do what we do

[Bridge]

[Hook]

Girl do it right there
You got me, you got me, Annie
You got me
If you don't know then...
