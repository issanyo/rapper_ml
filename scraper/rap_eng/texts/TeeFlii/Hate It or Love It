My face fat
That means I'm eating where your steaks at
Where your real dogs that love you not them fake cats
Where them girls that got your name as a face tatt
Know by your first can't replace that

Beefing with your nigas, so you stay strapped
Believe me its religious where your grace at
Jumping after portswherel you're faith at
Where the blocks where you made your plays at
I put slauson on the map You gotta face …facts …
Kept it hood like 6 braides and blue wave caps
Said I couldn't but I did, you can't change that
You can hate it, you can love it that won't change jack

(- Teeflii)
You can hate ot you can love it
Hate or love it, hate or love it
I will never stop my gride I came too far to look behind

You say I couldn't, I did it, I did it
You say I wouldn't I did, I did
And you can stop me, you can stop me, you can stop me

(verse 2 Teeflii)
Haters try to fuck with my mind, keep on talking from behind
I ain't got no worries at all
Nigga I grind for this, homie im made for this
This is too my ex-s that be sais we alongdont get
They can hate but I know they gotta hear this song
Ooh, and you ain't ever found a young nigga like me
Yeah I did what you saidI wouldn't do

(hook)
Hate it or love it
Hate it or love it
Hate or love it, hate or love it
I will never stop my gride I came too far to look behind
You say I couldn't, I did it, I did it
You say I wouldn't I did, I did
And you can stop me, you can stop me, you can stop me

(verse 3- Nipsey)
From one way bus stops, busting ‘til the gun stop
To pulling up in young drop, and parking front of drug spots
Look at how your young popped …Look at how this young flock
Looking out my living room, like hell no, I won't stop
All I need is one shut, that; s just how we was taught
Sitting in a circle all silent thas cause funds talk
…desperation rubbed off…find myself I was lost
Sketched it out, architecht the blue prints of a young boss

Hate or love it, hate or love it
I will never stop my gride I came too far to look behind
You say I couldn't, I did it, I did it
You say I wouldn't I did, I did
And you can stop me, you can stop me, you can stop me

(4- Nipsey)
Some times i think that
All I do it's break hearts, all this nigga fake hard.i ain't caught a state charge
So I just wanna thank God, see me in that new cord see me with a new broad
Everything I've been throught tell me i went to far
I ain't have enough niga, screaming out, fuck niggas
This ain't good luck nigga, another good run nigga
I'd have too or three, and between you and me
I don't hate none of yours
Cuz jealousy ain't new to me

()
Hate or love it, hate or love it
I will never stop my grade I came too far to look behind
You say I couldn't, I did it, I did it
You say I wouldn't I did, I did
And you can stop me, you can stop me, you can stop me no
