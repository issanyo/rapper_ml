I woke up Tuesday to a sexy lip
She made turkey bacon and wheat toast
I had to represent
And we been off and on ever since
Might take you back to Disneyland, girl I ain't forget
Aye
The player president no failed attemps
Tryna get these girl back to the hotel and shit
And see if we can fix this lil' situation
You know them real nigga conversations
I'm looking at houses up in View Park
Ballin' and rappin' I play two sports
A LA nigga I might go get the Benz out in New Port
So help me figure out what I need you for

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Check this out
You can't tell, check the smell
California dreamin'
Some more iTunes money to buy another beamer
Fiendin' for love and alcohol
The life of a Westside nigga with a catalogue
I didn't know you had 'em all
The mixtapes
She say "Dom, boy, you been great"
And I'mma buy the album anyway
You been straight
I be going hard from like Wednesday to Wednesday
It's a lot of chit chat tell me what your friends say
We can go Henn straight, and I got 4 Veuve's
Might order Pizza Hut you know I'm from the old school
Might see me on the silver screen though with Tom Cruise
Tryin' to kick it with them other niggas is the wrong move

[Hook: TeeFlii]
