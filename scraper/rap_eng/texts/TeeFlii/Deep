[Hook: TeeFliii]
Your crease is what I'm feelin'
And your style is what I'm diggin'
Girl let's get personal
Annie let me go deep, deep, deep, deep, deep
Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep (deep in like the ocean)
Annie let me go deep, deep, deep, deep, deep
Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep (deep in like the ocean)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm ridin' slow like an old nigga
All gold like a dope dealer
I'm throwin' cash like I go with her
Hold your head high, oh no nigga
Get cash like the old folks
Dodge potholes when you on spokes
Hold the .45 smokin' on dope
All white Chevy, what he on? Coke
Streets talk and they call it word to mind
Whole hood know what you murdered bout'
Strip club poppin' but it ain't safe
Niggas tell and comin' home on the same day

[Hook: TeeFliii]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Come kick it with a nigga who (hooo)
Fly more than I drive, get it from the supplier
If I want it I buy it, that pussy fire, she stay the night
She ain't even like smoke
Now she rolling up her own joints
Or packin' her G pen
Lil Bombay make the room start spinnin'
Even though a lot of niggas prolly in your ear
I'mma put you on somethin', you ain't heard it like this before
I'mma do it how you want it
Lemme see you jump on it, act like you rode a dick before

[Hook: TeeFliii]

[Verse 3: TeeFliii]
Ain't no I in no team, and no team in no I's
Ain't no reason to be acting shady
No lie, no lie, I make you change sides
No lie, no lie, give it up to my real niggas

[Hook: TeeFliii]
