Everybody know your turn up real, real
Poke it out, show me something I can feel, feel
See even though you ain't my girl
These ways I'm feeling for you is real
See even though you ain't my girl

In the club feelin' on your thighs

And he take your time
You bomb from head to toe
You got your hair done and your nails done
Pretty lady, lady
