[Intro]

Do your thang Annie
You the life of this party
Everybody knows who you are

[Verse 1]

Let me get a private dance
Can you do it with no hands?
You all on the top of me Annie
You make the body go round, round, round
You the baddest Annie in this town, town, town, town

[Bridge]

I'm trying to stick my wootie in your cootie
I'm flexing while I'm feeling all on your booty
Nobody gon' put it down like this
Nobody gon' put it down like this
Annie get it, cause girl you with it
The way you're moving your body
It makes me wanna

[Hook]
See you in your sexy lingerie
Lingerie, see you in your sexy lingerie
Annie, I wanna see you in your sexy lingerie
Lingerie, see you in your sexy lingerie
Aw yeah

[Verse 2]

Right before you go to sleep
Annie girl call me
And I'll come over and put it right on you
Ain't no reason to be patient with no weak nigga
You know how to fuck me and I know how to fuck you

[Bridge]
