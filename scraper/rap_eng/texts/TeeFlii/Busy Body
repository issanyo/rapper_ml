[Verse 2: E-40]
Ooh, she do numbers
Busy body, getting ready for the summer
Bad hottie, all the trap niggas want her
Lady boss, don't nobody own her
Fuck a scale from one to ten, you a hundred
Ten times ten, I’m glad me and you ain’t kin
You be stuntin', you and your BFF’s
Pretty face, small waist, big breast
Short dress-ed to impress, you the best
You doin’ numbers like a SAT test
I’ll deliver like I work for UPS, trackin' number long as my checks
Yo’ dude ain’t did doodley, he treat you bad, he ain't cool
Nigga pretend to be hard, he wasn’t like that in school
Some fool’s don't know what they got till what they got, got gone
Drop the sap, and get with a mack, leave the sucka alone

[Verse 3: Too Short]
Can’t lie, she got a whole ‘lotta game
Most of these squares can’t hang
Not with a bitch like that
She gon’ have you spendin’ stacks, if you tryna get hit that cat
You gotta pay for it, and then fuck her
But you don’t mind payin', 'cause you a sucker
I heard she got fucked last night too
It’s just what some of these bitches do
If niggas like you keep cakin’ ‘em
Niggas like me ‘gon keep breakin' em’
And if these bitches don't get it, I’m shakin’ em’
But not you, shoppin' is where you takin' em’
Let a real nigga push up on that lil’ bitch
She gon' change her attitude up real quick
But its so many tricks out here now
They be hanging in the club cashin' hoes out (bitch!)

[Chorus: TeeFlii]
She’s so incredible (ain’t, no doubt about it)
She’s so incredible (yeah, yeah, yeah, might let her ride it)
Everybody know that you a busy body, baby
