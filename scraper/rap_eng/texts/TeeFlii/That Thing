[intro]
Freak killer, freak kill more

[Chorus]
You dancing in your dress
Girl running like a marathon
I cum when you're cumming
Talk to me, I talk back
(Teeflii on this motherfucker)
Girl you on me, you doing tricks with that thing
Girl you on me, you doing tricks with that thing
Girl you on me, you doing tricks with that thing
Girl you on me, you doing tricks with that thing

[Vesre 1]
Everything everything EML
It don't cost to keep it 100
You like that all day
Your crew your [?]
Wobbling, wobbling, looking back at it
I'm so attached to it, Annie
Girl you know you're stuck to me like glue

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie let me see you twerk, twerk, twerk, twerking it out
I'll be watching you

[Chorus]
You dancing in your dress
Girl running like a marathon
I cum when you're cumming
Talk to me, I talk back
Girl you on me, you doing tricks with that thing
Girl you on me, you doing tricks with that thing
Girl you on me, you doing tricks with that thing
Girl you on me, you doing tricks with that thing

[Verse 2]
Way you drop it to the floor
The way you make it bounce
You come out the shower with no towel on
Fuck with hater say if you fuck with me the long way
And you fuck with me the long way
Yeah you fuck with me the long way

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie let me see you twerk, twerk, twerk, twerking it out
I'll be watching you

[Chorus]
You dancing in your dress
Girl running like a marathon
I cum when you're cumming
Talk to me, I talk back
Girl you on me, you doing tricks with that thing
Girl you on me, you doing tricks with that thing
Girl you on me, you doing tricks with that thing
Girl you on me, you doing tricks with that thing
Girl you on me, you doing tricks with that thing

[Chorus]
You dancing in your dress
Girl running like a marathon
