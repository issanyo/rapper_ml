Girl don’t you see what I see
We’re sexing in the mirror
Barking like it’s nothing Annie, you know you won’t take
It’s written all over your face

[Pre-Chorus]
I see that you trippin’ off that [?] but you ain’t got to say a word
You know I don’t do it like these other niggas
I’m gon’ please your body

Sex tape, we gon’ make a sex tape
Girl you know, we gon’

We gon’ make a ,we gon’ make a
Sex tape, sex tape

[Verse 2]
Annie go ahead and lay, let me take off all of your clothes
Let me see you bend over, touch your toes

[Pre-Chorus]
I see that you trippin’ off that [?] but you ain’t got to say a word
You know I don’t do it like these other niggas
I’m gon’ please your body

[Chorus]
Sex tape, we gon’ make a sex tape
Girl you know, we gon’
Sex tape, we gon’ make a sex tape
You be filming all
Our sex tape, sex tape
We gon’ make a ,we gon’ make a
Sex tape, sex tape

It’s written all over your face but you ain’t got to say a word
It’s written all over your face but you ain’t got to say a word

Girl you know, we gon’
Sex tape, we gon’ make a sex tape
You be filming all
