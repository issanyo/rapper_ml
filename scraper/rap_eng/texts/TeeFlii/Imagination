[Verse 1]
I slide up in your bitch DM’s like
You’ve been acting like your nigga ain’t been fucking you right
You ain’t had it good in a long time
Let me do it, I’ll do it right
I heard you like to get hit from the back
I can make you, I can make you tap out
Over and in, and in
I’ll go overtime just cause you want it

[Chorus]
You gon’ be my baby, gon’ be my baby, gon’ be my baby
We making sex faces, we trading places
Girl it was my imagination
Annie my imagination was running with me
Yeah, we can get it poppin’, poppin’, poppin’, poppin’
Your body on it poppin’, poppin’, poppin’, poppin’
You fill my tusk and you lose control
You look surprised acting like you don’t know

[Bridge]
Tell your camera girl we gon’ make a movie
Tell your camera girl we gon’ make a movie
You be doing it like that, you keep throwing it back
You be doing it like that, you keep throwing it back
Tell your camera girl we gon’ make a movie
Tell your camera girl we gon’ make a movie
