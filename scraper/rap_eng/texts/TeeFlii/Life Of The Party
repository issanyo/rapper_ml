[Chorus: Kevin McCall Teeflii]
Be a freak and climb on top of me
You the life of the party baby
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me

[Verse 1: Teeflii]
Bout that life, yeah you know what it is, what it is
I’m the reason that you on [?] and that you on the map
Legs shaking from me putting it down
In the shower for some hours
I like to see, I like to see you put on

[Pre-Chorus: Teeflii]
Late night sex, early mornings
I’m your drug, girl I keep you up
Make it do what it do
Lets go have fun now baby

[Chorus: Kevin McCall Teeflii]
Be a freak and climb on top of me
You the life of the party baby
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me

[Verse 2: Teeflii]
Wrestling with your body all night long
In your sexy lingerie
You could get my super soaker
Got that right conversation
You say everything I need to hear
Baby just don’t keep me waiting
I’m tryna leave, leave the keys under the door mat

[Pre-Chorus: Teeflii]
Late night sex, early mornings
I’m your drug, girl I keep you up
Make it do what it do
Lets go have fun now baby

[Chorus: Kevin McCall Teeflii]
Be a freak and climb on top of me
You the life of the party baby
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
Be a freak and climb on top of me
