[Chorus: Teefli]
Everything that it took to get us here, we had to do it on our own
If you ain’t from the team you a nobody, uh, you a nobody
Nobody, nobody
You ain’t from the team you a nobody
Nobody, nobody, uh, you a nobody
Nobody, nobody
You ain’t from the team you a nobody
Nobody, nobody
You ain’t from the team you a nobody

[Verse 1: TeeFlii]
You ain’t my nigga no, you a nobody
Ask around the hood homie, you a nobody
Cause hood niggas don’t fuck with you
And yo’ bitch really don’t fuck with you
[?] around us everyday, I bet she gon’ choose up
Bet a thug’ll make her wet
Have her all on me
Make the pussy act right cause she know I out on for my niggas

[Chorus: Teefli]
Everything that it took to get us here, we had to do it on our own
If you ain’t from the team you a nobody, uh, you a nobody
Nobody, nobody

Nobody, nobody, uh, you a nobody
Nobody, nobody
You ain’t from the team you a nobody
Nobody, nobody
You ain’t from the team you a nobody

[Verse 2: Yeahdat]
F you ain’t from the team you a nobody
He ain’t met a team that was so cocky
Was sitting at the top and it’s so comfy
When I look around, I don’t see nobody
Nobody, I don’t see nobody
And I ain’t tryna fuck your bitch, she got no body
So get you girl, on me, cause your girl on me
And stop fuckin’ with my clique cause we so bout it
Look at the cars that we be in
Bad foreign broad but the car European
Niggas going hard from the am to the pm
And we started from the bottom so I know you niggas see us

[Chorus: Teefli]
Everything that it took to get us here, we had to do it on our own
If you ain’t from the team you a nobody, uh, you a nobody
Nobody, nobody
You ain’t from the team you a nobody
Nobody, nobody, uh, you a nobody
Nobody, nobody
You ain’t from the team you a nobody
Nobody, nobody
You ain’t from the team you a nobody
