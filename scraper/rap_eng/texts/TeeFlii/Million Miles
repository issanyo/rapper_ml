[Verse 1]
They don’t really know nothin’ ‘bout us, Annie
They don’t really know what we do to each other
They don’t know our sex game be lit, so sick
Don’t just know me, Annie, girl you really fuck with me
And every day you show me
Everybody, everybody wanna know who you are
So they just hurt your body
You rachet, you turnt up, you the shit girl
Now I got your ex-man feelin’ some type of way
Cause he ain’t do, no he ain’t do
Do his job

[Bridge]
No one in the world can hold you
No one in the world gonna do you
No one in the world’s gonna fuck like I do

[Hook]
You could be average
You could be a bad bitch
I would still fuck with you
I’ma put my pride to the side for you
You could be a million miles away
You could be a million miles away girl
I’d do whatever it takes to get to you
You could be a million miles away, Annie, yeah
A million miles away

[Verse 2]
No doubt about it girl, you certified
It ain’t a nigga in this world that would deny you
Shit, look what I get to wake up every day to
Girl you the baddest of the baddest
I like it when you do nasty things for me
When you go up and down
Like a roller coaster, an elevator, or a real low rider
See Annie I feel that you was made for me
I mean, shit
It wouldn’t even seem right if you wasn’t
With me
Because there’s no one in the world

[Bridge]
No one in the world can hold you
No one in the world gonna do you
No one in the world’s gonna fuck like I do

[Hook]
You could be average
You could be a bad bitch
I would still fuck with you
I’ma put my pride to the side for you
You could be a million miles away
You could be a million miles away girl
I’d do whatever it takes to get to you
You could be a million miles away, Annie, yeah
A million miles away

[Bridge]
No one in the world can hold you
No one in the world gonna do you
No one in the world’s gonna fuck like I do
No one in the world can hold you
No one in the world gonna do you
No one in the world’s gonna fuck like I do

[Hook]
You could be average
You could be a bad bitch
I would still fuck with you
I’ma put my pride to the side for you
You could be a million miles away
You could be a million miles away girl
I’d do whatever it takes to get to you
You could be a million miles away, Annie, yeah
A million miles away
