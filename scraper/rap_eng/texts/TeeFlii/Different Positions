[Intro]
It's alright to tell them fuck 'em
It's [?], TeeFlii on this motherfucker

[Hook]
Never had it like this
I know he never did you like this
Different positions
Different positions
I'll put you in different positions
Oh, I'll put you in different positions

[Verse 1]
Showing out tonight
Don't even worry about your nigga
Cause he don't like it when you do freaky shit
He can't even handle your body, body

[Pre-Hook]
So drop down and give me fifty, girl, [?] with it
So drop down and give me fifty, girl, [?] with it, [?] with it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
These other bitches ain't where you at
Tell them hoes get on your level
They see you getting ratchet
Throwing it back, looking back at it
Let me feel all on you
Girl you want this thug love, thug love

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Let me lick you up and down 'til you say
Let me lick you up and down 'til you say
You wanna go another round
You wanna go another round

[Hook]
