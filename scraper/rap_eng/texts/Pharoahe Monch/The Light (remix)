Uh-huh, alright, alright, alright, okay, uh-huh, a-yeah

[Pharoahe Monch]
It was like the earth twisted around her
She shifted the ground I was like, "Ohhhhh.. SHIT!"
She's off the hook, I would dress her decently
But look her body is immaculate I'm attackin it from all positions
Of thinkin inside my mind-ah
Hopefully it won't be too inappropriate if I walk over there and say
"Excuse me, can I have your number please?
I'll get on my knees if I have to"
She'll laugh through, the whole episode
Just then I knew I had her locked (down)
No cock-blocking please this one's mine (uh)
Dimepiece and shit son, shorty was fine
Every line of mine was like a rhyme I wouldn't lie I swear
Sparklin the whole time as I whispered in her ear

Chorus: repeat 2X
