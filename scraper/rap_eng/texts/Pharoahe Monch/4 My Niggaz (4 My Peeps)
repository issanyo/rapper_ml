[Red Hot Lover Tone]
For all my motherfucking niggas, word to Herb we get stupider
Running mad circles round your crew like Jupiter
Oops, I mean Saturn, rappers sadden
Cause I'm mad in the pad and suckers wish they had and
I'm bagging the bitches grabbing, my pockets fatten
Like Madden, then I just lamp like Aladdin
So what you gonna do when I come through your town
With mad niggas who love being locked down
Facing convictions, throwing conniptions
I got more bitches than them royal Egyptians
Step to this mic you're a goner
Cause Red Hot Lover's right on like Cynthia Horner
I better warn ya, you'll get your ass kicked, I'm blasted
That's it, I drop it like a clumsy black bastard
I'm getting figures from my rap diggers
Got my shit-kickers, yo, this is for my niggas

[The Notorious B.I.G.]
Introducing the black bastard from Bedrock
Guaranteed to make your head rock, tote Glocks
Drop cops that mistake me for Rodney
Strictly head shots, I knock the twist out your dreadlocks
Who got the props? Biggie
Who got the Glock? Biggie
But who is he?
You can't get my description, you need a prescription
Two doses of the ferocious
Feel the weight when I'm crushing 'em, bumrushing 'em
Stuffing 'em, I put the pressure on em, hon
Lord a mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just sliced like a Ginsu
Look what I been through, the Brooklyn streets
The obese thug nigga from the East
The black nine, hard to find motherfucker
After the rhyme press rewind, motherfucker
Strictly for my niggas

[Prince Po]
I nod my head cause the flavor hovers over
Universal Soldier of Hip Hop, somebody shoulda told ya
40 Projects Southside Jamaica Queens, please don't
Sleep I walk the unforbidden where most MC's won't
Check it, if you ever felt sceptic about my intellect, it's
Hectic, I'm like antiseptic on record
Disinfectant show wrecker, sound seizing your sector
Local areas, across seas, even in Rome and Mecca
I'm known, Prince, organizing with the Red Hot Lover
And the bad brother Biggie Smalls from another
Planet called Brooklyn, hey good looking
Do you like your hot chocolate after dark - uh
I'm scared to get you hooked in
You might have to seek medical attention, the unforgettable type
Representing my niggas rocking, rocking the mic right
Harcore M.O.P. type shit
Peace to my other half and my niggas doing bids

[Li'l Fame]
I used to start more shit than high school bullies
I was doing my thing since my nigga Boom Bang used to steal cars from police
I break niggas up like referees
Put em on point, back out my joint and making 'em move like refugees
Li'l Fame rep is Brooklyn bound
Still niggas that fuck around'll catch a beatdown from Brownsville
I'm going all out the western way
Old school or new school, I beat your ass like it's freshmen's day

[Billy Danze]
For y'all wannabe emcees F-A-G's
You gon' fuck around and make that nigga Bill squeeze
I'm representing for all mines with nines
Hardcore's in town, my niggas that get down
A hill figure on the trigger (true)
Your Crooklyn sounds got pounds and break through
Stopped puffing the lye, still sipping the brew
So I be on cruise when you snooze and then you lose

[Li'l Fame (unreleased mix only)]
It's Li'l Fame, motherfucker (slap, Little Mallet)
We bring you pain, motherfucker (slap, Little Mallet)
Cos I'm rugged no gimmick
And I'm taking rappers out like Uptown niggas be doing bitches on 125th and Lennox
I represent M.O.P., niggas that act stuck up they get stuck up
Or even fucked the fuck up
Peace to Tone, yo pass that blunt, hit this slicker
This is for my niggas

[Billy Danze (unreleased mix only)]
Yo hold me down, Fame (I got the pound)
Danze with the truck shit, that I don't give a fuck shit
I'm hitting niggas where it hurt, I do work
(I'm packing my blue steel) so you niggas hit the dirt
The M.O.P. we been busting out for days
Taking 'em through a phase, going out in a blaze
I'm out jail still holding my steel
(Bucka) Bow! Wargames representing this build
Brownsville, for my niggas

[Red Hot Lover Tone]
Word, and Red Hot Lover Tone tossing suckers like salad
Incredible vocabulary coming from the Brooklyn freak
Peace to Fulton Street
Knuckleheads'll get wrecked with the quick mic-check
My intellect shows no respect for suckers who slept
In fact my rap style attracts
I have your girl looking for me in broad daylight
With a flashlight, pillow, and mattress on her back
Cause yo shit is wack
So here goes the No-Doze, I'm putting it on foes who oppose
Coming off like porno pantihose
Peace to Organized Konfusion and B.I.G
The M.O.P., from R-e-d
For all my niggas in the NYC
