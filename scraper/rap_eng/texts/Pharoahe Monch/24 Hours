[Chorus: Pharoahe Monch]
Give me my motherfuckin' money
I want my goddamn money
In 24 hours you better have my money
I got bills and shit, I need medicine
Roof over my head, Con Edison
I need it
I want it

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
In '99 I caught a case for a rhyme, rape charge
Cut a Klansman's face, slashed his throat with the race card
Lyrically intergalactic
When I arrange to properly wait between my words, spacebars
Don't make me show you pictures of your daughter's grade school location
Your teenager goes to Queens Vocational
You? Wall Street occupation
Me? I'll occupy Wall Street like the protest just to discuss interest rates and inflation
Not stocks and bonds, but
Contusions and knots, fractions and blood coagulation
My medication is next to go
But I'ma get it out of Canada or Mexico
I need cash in hand with extra dough
For my albuterol and my Lexapro
Give me my money

[Chorus: Pharoahe Monch]
Give me my motherfucking money
I want my goddamn money
In 24 hours you better have my money
I got bills and shit, I need medicine
Roof over my head, Con Edison
I need it
I want it

[Bridge: Pharoahe Monch (Lil' Fame)]
Now they gon' make me drop a name on 'em (Say what?)
Totally inflict pain on 'em (Say what?)
I'ma get insane on 'em
They sayin' I'm sick so I'm a sick Lil' Fame on 'em

[Verse 2: Lil' Fame & Pharoahe Monch]
You got 24 hours to pay me my bread or you don't owe me nothing (Ante up!)
'Cause when I see you, you gon' get yo' head busted
I don't care if they rob Peter just to pay Paul
Peter gon' fuck around and get his ass Peter Rose
Scratch a match, burn that bitch for clownin' with Jamal
Taxiderm that bitch and mount him on the wall (Okay)
Time tickin'
All you gon' hear is that nine clickin'
I'm tryna get rich or die tryin'
Got my niggas speakin' to my son like
Don't worry, Claude, you gon' get them Sneakers (That's right)
That's what a nigga get for fuckin' with them leeches (Oh)
Could've furnished your crib with all the deluxe features (Oh)
Captain underground, you are just a lieutenant (Nigga)
I'm a Brownsvillain with a chest full of ribbons (Nigga)
It was 23 hours and a couple minutes
I threw that bird into a safe, she had my money plus interest
I said

[Chorus: Pharoahe Monch]
Give me my motherfuckin' money
I want my goddamn money
In 24 hours you better have my money
I got bills and shit, I need medicine
Roof over my head, Con Edison
I need it
I want it

[Outro: Pharoahe Monch]
I need it
Want it
Need it
Want it
