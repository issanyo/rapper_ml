[Bridge]
Deleted scenes of American dreams blurred
I'm the American dream deferred
And I do not have any fucks to give
So get them hands up, let's live
You are now rocking with the phenom phenomenal
Original indigenous Geronimo
So hiyya hiyya heyy
We gon' rock it all night and all day and get crazy

[Chorus]
Yea
Crazy

[Verse 1]
This is not a popular pop hit for the populous
This is Doctor Octopus mixed with the innocuous
Six pictures that depict the apocalypse
Pictures of a mosh pit in a fallen metropolis
The karma of a kamikaze pilot without binoculars
Probably like an oxy to paparazzi photographers
You are a carbon copy, a mockery of this rock shit
I should probably just pop you in the back of the head and watch you
(Four... three... two... Drop!)
Thirteen! You know the X is for anonymous
Feels like I'm in the prime of my life but not Rodimus

[Refrain]
'Cause radio can suck my dick
And Wall Street can lick my balls
'Cause it's all about the 1%, let it burn
Let it fall to the ground, just get up to get down and go crazy

[Chorus]
Yea
Crazy
We gon' what?!
We gon' rock it all night and all day and get crazy
Yea
Crazy

[Verse 2]
I wanna kidnap every rapper that's rapping over this trap shit
Slap him in a contraption and smack him 'til he's collapsing
Specially these backward rappers from New York who be acting like they're immaculate with the raps but don't really be living the trapping life
Remove his organs then utilize as a sacrifice
Now ya favorite rapper's a mutilated hermaphrodite
Saved him like a pastor then booted him to the afterlife
Executed, electrocuted him with a catheter
Attach it to back of a battery then blasted via satellite
And let the whole wide world witness
The gradual decapitation of a rapper with an exact-o knife
The massive massacre of actors that aren't acting right

[Refrain]
'Cause radio can suck my dick
And Wall Street can lick my balls
'Cause it's all about the 1%, let it burn
Let it fall to the ground, just get up to get down and go crazy

[Chorus]
Yea
Crazy
We gon' what?!
We gon' rock it all night and all day and get crazy
Yea
Crazy
