[Hook: Citizen Cope]
It doesn't take your eyes to see what the paint won't take away
When they take that veil away
You're just caught up in the mass confusion
Confused by the Grand Illusion
They're never gonna let you see it
Cause if they did, we'd all be free, yeah
You're just caught up in the mass confusion
Confused by the Grand Illusion

[Pharoahe Monch]
We were told that the Hell below was a fiery inferno
I rediscovered my soul between the lines inside my journal
Trapped within a +Penn State+ of mind, Joe Paterno
External gratification is not happiness eternal
Interject, intellect, intercept, Internet
A slave majority where five percent benefit
Photoshopped images, re-touched photography
Pornography, sodomy, child labor economy
Put away your hope, same political policies
Two-thousand and ten, only minus the space odyssey
There's gotta be a better way, we pray to hit the lottery
We all need of the rapist...
For the robbery of our God, an official public apology
An angel plotted to have Organized Konfusion
You fell for the delusion, I'll expose the movement
Illusion...

[Hook]

[Pharoahe Monch]
Professional analysts, rhetoric, rambling
Symbicort, Advair, Albuterol, ambient
I change the channel on commercials when I'm channeling
Everybody's a star, lights, cameras
Seventeen-thousand times a day the human eye blinks
Making us even more subjectable to the hijinks
IPhone, iChat, who gives a fuck what I think?
One world currency, doesn't matter where I bank
There is no pot of gold at the end of a mythical rainbow
We're uneducated contestants, life is the game show
Your leader is the host, the results are painful
The judges weave a web in which we all get tangled
Their only contribution to the world is a delusion
Which has no physical power, I offer you a solution
Pharoahe Monch, the antonym for translucent
Lyrical revolution, I'll expose the movement
Illusion...
