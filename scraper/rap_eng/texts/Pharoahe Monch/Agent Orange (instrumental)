(Hook 1)
Please lord forgive me for my sins
My life is all I have to give
Please lord forgive me for my sins
My life is all I have to give
Damn you that lost the will to live

(Verse 1)
Pissed on the motherf**king White House lawn
I threw a rock (Iraq), then I ran (Iran)
Cause I couldn't stand anymore within the grips of the man
Y'all wanna ask me who's sane (Hussein)
These biological gasses are eating my brain
Its a political grab bag to rape mother earth
Thirty seconds after they bagged dad (Baghdad) for what he's worth
Thousands will die now so millions can smile later
This ain't the +Rockford Files+ nigga
They stockpile data for satellites
Where you discuss who's style is greater
In this killing pool you playing it cool like Cal Tjader
When ya'll ready to rock like Led Zep and Al Qaeda
With weapons of mass destruction an hour later
What's your identidy today?
You on some John F. Kennedy or Timothy McVeigh?
This Henessy done left me with a remedy to spray
For my identity your life is the penalty to pay
Motherf**ker

(Monch) {Crowd}
(Y'all ready to rock?)
{We ready to rock}
(Y'all ready to roll?)
{We ready to roll}

(Hook 2)
My life is all I have to give
Please lord forgive me for my sins
My life is all I have to give
Damn you that lost the will to live
Trapped in the game
Just tryin to win (3x)

(Verse 2)
Its not a Vietnam song
I know women from desert storm who came back deformed
Missin limbs and diseases in they legs and arms
Chemicals twice as strong as agent orange
Its messages in the bass drum
War goin off in your mind
No man is safe from
Its not a Game Boy, Xbox, the PlayStation

Its +Resident Evil+ when every President's a mason
Robbin (Robin) y'all fools like Dick Grayson
And y'all inherited roots and don't know how to retrace them
Place them back
Face them facts
Disgraceful, faceless, tasteless acts
Pharoahe takes teh authorities to court
Peep crime before it happens like +Minority Report+
And I will never be mentally defenseless
Cats be on the block, in the hood in the trenches sayin

(Monch) {Crowd}
(Y'all ready to rock?)
{We ready to rock}
(Y'all ready to roll?)
{We ready to roll}

(Hook 3)
My life is all I have to give
Please lord forgive me for my sins
My life is all I have to give

(Monch) {Crowd}
(Y'all ready to rock?)
{We ready to rock}
(Y'all ready to roll?)
{We ready to roll}

(Monch)
Damn you that lost the will to live
Trapped in the game just tryin to win

(Monch) {Crowd}
(Y'all ready to rock?)
{We ready to rock}
(Y'all ready to roll?)
{We ready to roll}

(Monch) (2x)
Lock! Load! Into position
Rock! Roll! Its primitive coondition

(Monch)
Lock! Load!
Rock! Roll!
Into position

(Crowd) (2x)
We ready to rock
We ready to roll
