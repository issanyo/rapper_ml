[Verse 1: Mr. Complez]
In a minute I'ma intervene on the internet
You wanna enter the mind from closer, to intercom
And dot com for Complex styles
Plus how it mold ya skull
Ask Moulder and Skully from the X-Files
Those wild-asses broke into my crib, lookin for clues
Went through my rhyme books, I thought they were crooks
So I beat 'em like they stole somethin
I'm tired of shit - I told 'em for the umpteenth time
You can't battle me with my own rhyme
He said "Yo ya rhymes just so phat!"
I said "Ya don't know what phat is" - He said "No diggity"
He kept begging me, I tryed to figure how he
Know so much on this topic
Just then I noticed Ebonics 1 hanging out his pocket
I said "What's that in your pocket?"
He said "Getcha hands out my pocket"
His chin was slow so I socked it
He fell back and pulled out a gat, and pointed it at
And rata-tat-tat - And Skully screamed no
Just then I knew I had fractions of a second just to kick a flow
But yo, the shots missed
You can blame it on the rhyme invention...
Or divine intervention

[Hook: Stophanic Smith harmonizing]

[Bridge: Complex]
Divine intervention...
Divine intervention...
I mentioned attention to the scene
I come across the forces that intervene
Left in suspension...
Is it the rhyme or divine intervention

[Verse 2: Mr. Complex]
Red pillow, eyes heavy, droopin, they're closin, I'm comfy
I'm driftin, dozin, expand, Sandman, dreamland
I'm havin visions of improvisin on the mic
The audience is risin to huge heights
You should see how they screamin
It's like I'm runnin 'em over with a truck
What the what? The record's causin a ruckus
I bust back with the word, the word provoked the herb
The herb provoked the verb, the dream broke when I hit the curb
Whoa, I can't distinguish my dreams from the real
I'm not even in bed, I'm sittin up behind the steering wheel
I gotta stop this goin two days without sleep
I'm takin in two lanes, then I hear two beeps
I keep on cuz I'm only minutes from my crib - I struggle all my might
But it's all over when I pull up to the red light
Last thing I recall was makin a left on the conduit to Rocker Way
Thought I could do it cuz I was a block away
I gave it my best, never-the-less, I blacked out..
The scene I tried to act out cuz I don't know how I got home
Was it the rhyme I was kickin off the dome?
Or was it I was just never alone?
Never alone.. never alone..
