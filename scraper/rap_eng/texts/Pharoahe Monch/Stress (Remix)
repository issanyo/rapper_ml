[Pharoahe Monche]
Yo it's the verbal assault weapon with words uncanny
You can boo me but I cannot fuck with Rudy Guiliani
Press the panic button, shit it's the schizophrenic, can it
I can kill it from the West Coast to the Atlantic
Nowadays it seems it's hard to maintain
Can't take the stress, yes God I'm going insane
If you can feel my pain, say yes
If you can feel the pain, say stress
Pharoahe, I possess the skills to bring it to your chest
With lyrics and manifestation for the entire nation
With his excellency, Prince standing next to me
And especially the Extra P on the SP
Twelve zero zero, I stand tall and be a hero
In times of stress, the Pharoahe won't fess

[Hook]
Crush, kill, destroy stress

[Large Professor]
Now ain't nothing deeper than having to throw a nigga in the sleeper
For stress, and take that shit from Large Profess
Cause I be on the train trying to maintain
Getting lowered in the hole while the record man gain
And it make me want to sting somebody with the shottie
Cause I can't relate to living less than great
So while I make a fat beat to eat
Some of my mans from John Bowne High School is sleeping in the street
That stress shit is ill, if you let it it will
Have you ass on the staircase smoking a krill
Never that for me, nigga, my name's Extra P
I can't afford to be stressed the fuck out in '93
Or '94, cause everybody know my solution to being stressed is looking at the front door

[Hook]

[Prince Po]
God knows I can't take the stress, working my fingers to the bone
That middle finger's for all you rap singers
Not representing your hood
I stroll through the projects, giving niggas dap cause my respect's good
Verbal assassinator, sharp as the tongue, I come
Out of my pockets to forfend the risk before another brother
And another one that you're looking for, Mr Bigot
Officer I'm legit like can you dig it
Hey lady, I don't want your pocket book, my black ass
Don't like my ass black? I'd rather cross the street leaving a stupid look
On your grill, spark a Phill, parlay
O.C. told me that aside, call upon pay
Extra Large Professor, give me the rest of
That old funk, so what I left the rhyme on the dresser
My man Dalu, he's in this, rest in peace, you're in here
Pregnant sisters leave their daddy, Jah knows you're in there
Sincere to Queens cause the East is representing, baby doll
Prince is my name, shit's real so listen
