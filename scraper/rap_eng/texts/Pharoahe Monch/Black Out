[Intro: Lil Fame]
Black out!
Black out!

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, ayo, these duffle bag niggas is lame hoes, I flame those
Your papa should have left you as a stain on clothes
I rock heavy metal, eighteen carats or better
Blue Steel or Beretta, I'mma stack that feta
Guacamole, my shit is fat, I call it Roly Poly
Niggas is screamin' like, Damn Ghost holy moly
The baddest bitches walkin' two steps behind me
Cause the god's robes flaring out, shit I don't care about
One false move on the kid, I'm airing out
Dumpin', pellets be hop skip an' a jumpin'
With the automatic shotgun, hand on the pumpin'
Dum, dum, watch your whole body flop
And wild the fuck out, I'm like a bull in the china shop
Beasty, I can walk on cut glass, I bust ass
Niggas better cover they face or get slashed
Or see me an' ya granny in the yard gettin' trashed

[Hook]
Ayo back out, give em the whole thing, Black out
Squeeze until it spring break nigga, Black out
You run out of bullets then swing nigga, Black out
Don't give a fuck about a thing nigga, Black out
Ayo back out, give em the whole thing, Black out
Squeeze until it spring break nigga, Black out
You run out of bullets then swing nigga, Black out
Don't give a fuck about a thing nigga, Black out

[Verse 2: Lil Fame]
I chant warrior songs for all my warriors gone
Spit the blood, sweat, and tears, y’all just call it a song
Yes I’m highly explosive, Yes I’m something ferocious
Niggas fuckin’ with my nerves like multiple sclerosis
Watch out, you’ll get your food ate
Give em a buck and a half across the face and scrape the plate
I lift your motherfuckin hood up like a mechanic
And leave you layin for life in your hammock, god dammit
This is marksman

[Verse 3: Billy Danze]
My niggas is prone to black out
Double-handed out the Chevrolet until it max out
Mo Ps is Gs, these niggas tap out
Buck-a-buck-buck-buck-buck-buck-buck, push your back out
If you don't know what that's bout, pack up and stab out
Make a decision or deal with conditions when I spaz out
Unload, reload, unload, reload
Hand 'em a couple more, and keep a couple for the road

[Hook]
Ayo back out, give em the whole thing, Black out
Squeeze until it spring break nigga, Black out
You run out of bullets then swing nigga, Black out
Don't give a fuck about a thing nigga, Black out
Ayo back out, give em the whole thing, Black out
Squeeze until it spring break nigga, Black out
You run out of bullets then swing nigga, Black out
Don't give a fuck about a thing nigga, Black out

[Verse 4: Pharoahe Monch]
Pull out the ratchet, this is not rappity rap shit
It's, liver then Super Fly saliva when the MAC spit
That, raat, tip-tip-tip-tip-tip tap shit
That you cannot stick the landing like Gabby Douglas when you backflip
My Hammer Dance'll make y'all niggas do The Running Man
'77 blackout, Berkowitz, Son of Sam
Understand what you working with is WordPerfect
The earth surface is most prolific circuit breaker break your circuits
Ticket information, we blacks out
Spontaneous combustion, instantaneous gentrification (blackout!)
Poppin' your melon like Gallagher, you won't survive
Psychopath with a silencer, my caliber is forty five
Tumultuous tragedy, infamous, infamy
These egregious statistics will increase exponentially
Potentially, my brain is probably twisted
This auto shotty lifted your body and dropped it like a molly
Kid shit

[Hook]
Ayo back out, give em the whole thing, Black out
Squeeze until it spring break nigga, Black out
You run out of bullets then swing nigga, Black out
Don't give a fuck about a thing nigga, Black out
Ayo back out, give em the whole thing, Black out
Squeeze until it spring break nigga, Black out
You run out of bullets then swing nigga, Black out
Don't give a fuck about a thing nigga, Black out
