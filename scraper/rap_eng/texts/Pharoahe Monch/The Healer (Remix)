[Verse One] [Pharoahe Monch]:
We are renegades and wars to acronyms so fuck rallies
I'm in the park doin' reps, you in Bally's
And no I'm not referring to Slick Rick's shoes
P is walkin' time bomb like tick tick tick tick...
When gloomy economic statistics loom
Civilized people become terrorists
On stolen land that’s not even America’s, in the first place
That’s why the energy’s all fucked up
I Throw Stones like Palestinian drama
It’s bigger than Hilary, it’s bigger than Obama
It’s bigger than McCain, it’s bigger than the Pope
It’s unity, it’s faith, it’s change, it’s hope

[Hook] [Erykah Badu]:
Alhamdulillah Allah Jehovah
Yahweh Dios Ma'at Jah
Rastafari fyah dance, sex, music, hip-hop
It's bigger than religion, hip-hop
It's bigger than my nigga, hip-hop
It's bigger than the government
This one is for Dilla, hip-hop

[Verse Two] [Pharaohe Monch]:
And they want to ask me why I'm vocal inanimate
Cause I lost my focus like David Patterson
In the ghetto where it's impossible to escape
And the first obstacle is this tapeworm in my abdomen
Spear chucker, fuck that, I toss javelins
To five thousand dollar bills in the face of James Madison
This is America postmortem
To focus on your bogus novus ordo seclorum

[Erykah Badu]:
We ain't dead said the children don't believe it
We just made ourselves invisible
Underwater, stove-top
Blue flame scientists come out with your scales up
Get baptized in the ocean of the hungry

My niggas turn in to gods
Walls come tumblin...(aaahhh)

[Hook] [Erykah Badu]:
Alhamdulillah Allah Jehovah
Yahweh Dios Ma'at Jah
Rastafari fyah dance, sex, music, hip-hop
It's bigger than religion, hip-hop
It's bigger than my nigga, hip-hop
It's bigger than the government
This one is for Dilla, hip-hop

[Verse Three] [Erykah Badu]:
Told you we ain't dead yet
We've been livin' through your internet
You don't have to believe everything you think
We've been programmed wake up, we miss you
They call you indigo, we call you Africa
Go get baptized in the ocean of the people
Say reboot, refresh, restart
Fresh page, new day, o.g.'s, new key
