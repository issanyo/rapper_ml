[Intro: A-F-R-O]
The mass murderer
Mass murderer
A-F-R-O the kid

[Verse 1: A-F-R-O]
Native American land, saviour with lasers and anger
And banging patient a change of a shaking arrogant stance
Shaping the lyrics and stabbing ya face with hangers and masking tape
I laugh and jab at the wrath of pain [I merit ?] the grasp
Slash guitar, ask your dog, bomb make the planet drops
I'm saying  R.A. is rawer than Macklemore
Travel faster, laughter at ya rappers snap a track and apple Abernathy had an Adam's apple had venereal
Every tackled shackled factual pack of Jack and lack of sack and stackin' jackals
Afro is the head of rap hysteria
They say I'm gibberish, I did it on purpose
Lifted innocence from the virgin who went to the churches
Tips to the waitress [sits ?] in the mixing in the shift of the matrix
Iggy Azalea frog face look like Marlon Wayans on his worst day
Spray painted tainted verse slayed
Earn wage from Vern Ernest heard it from the grave

[Chorus: A-F-R-O]
I rip and I rhyme and
I rhyme and I rip
Now this is the way that the lines are spit
With A-F-R-O on the mic
Marco Polo on the boards
We swarm, we swarm
We swarm, we swarm

I rip and I rhyme and
I rhyme and I rip
Now this is the way that the lines are spit
With Pharoahe on the mic
Marco Polo on the boards
We swarm, we swarm
We swarm, we swarm

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
A panicking heroin addict
Sicker than Mr. Robot
Anakin Sky-walking
And I'm an animal on the mic
A cannibal cyborg protesting, fighting for his mechanical rights Publishing and my fucking mechanical rights
Swarm, West African killer bee abilities
A martyr with modern day smart bombs
Armed with Kevlar body armour
That's a part of my particle melting artillery
Kidnap the president's daughters without a plan
Brrrat!
Clap at the Ku Klux Klan and hack Hillary
And all this while I was getting head service from my personal server
Shit, she should not have been on her personal server
Cherry pickin' licking nipples playing Contra
With Jane Fonda, now that's a triple entendre
Pharoahe, I actually mastered the supernatural
Strike you out like Satchel
Then I'll clap at you in a tabernacle
Crack a statue wrapping Matthews backwards
If you're attacking A-F-R-O
Hijack a cracker jackass in a ransom if he's asking for cash flow
Fascist radical bastard with a beard who will be casted as Castro
Attacking the assassin with a spear, put my ashes out on these assholes
You gotta be kidding me, you're forbidding a battle of God when he got a gas mask on
We swarm

[Chorus: A-F-R-O]
I rip and I rhyme and
I rhyme and I rip
Now this is the way that the lines are spit
With Pharoahe on the mic
Marco Polo on the boards
We swarm, we swarm
We swarm, we swarm

I rip and I rhyme and
I rhyme and I rip
Now this is the way that the lines are spit
With A-F-R-O on the mic
Marco Polo on the boards
We swarm, we swarm
We swarm, we swarm
