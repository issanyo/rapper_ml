[Intro: [?]]
A lotta people don't really know what's goin' on in the world today man, younahmean? There's a lotta things, younahmean? Knowin' man to get more respect for man, listen

[Pre-Verse Ad-Lib: [?]]
Feeling good tonight baby
Got a live amp behind, ain't nothing like it baby

[Verse 1: ?]
Hard times in the ghettos, forced to make ends meet
Watching my brothers kill each other, for the thrill of defeat
Teach my sons and my nephew, yo it's real in these streets
You only got one life to live, you complete on your feet
And as the world turn it's only too tight baby
The gun and the knife, uhuh
The gun and the trife, it's all a part of life

[Verse 2: Prodigal Sunn]
Freak with the lethal, these niggas be evil
Moving with the actions of Smeagul, your shit is see through
Devils I see you, do what it do
And I came as Sun of Man, I'm still a son of men
The perfect plan working is, no time for the jerking man
You will catch a hurting man, for certain it's curtains
[?] you like a [?] stance
Mad men, weapons, Bentleys with the [?]
My words is my blood
If I gave you a [?] then I gave you a [?]

[Chorus: Corey Glover of Living Colour]
Who shot ya?
Who shot ya?
Who shot ya?
Who shot ya?

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
2-15, yo
I shot ya, nationwide cops under observation
It's hard to keep count of the deceased
More dead niggas, another half-assed press release
Black man blood starting to flood the street
Ya heartbeat's catching control of the [?]
Stop mumbling, face on the concrete
Resistance stopped when I fired a shot
You cough, I give a fuck about innocence or not
Your parents or your wife, new-born son, your daughter
Slaughter, on brand new body-cam-recorder
It's old school, new tools, you should learn though
Don't turn a blind eye just like Joe Paterno
I see you in Dante's Inferno
You leaving home, you never gon' return yo
Niggas know, the systematics of tracks is taking place
America, if you're the black, it ain't safe!

[Verse 4: Chuck D]
So I said what I said, just consider it said
Never been back or fell back or care what they read
Spit it in the red, and it ain't killed me
Instead it built me, never said love me baby
And it drove 'em crazy and Lord have mercy
And even if it hurt me, what if, but, or maybe
Never stooped down, or picked up a bad habit
I run from some son of a gun who grabbed it

[Chorus: Corey Glover]
Who shot ya?
Who shot ya? (Free)
Who shot ya?
Who shot ya? (Come on)

[Guitar Solo: Vernon Reid]
(Uh, salute, hey!)
(No)
(Who shot ya?)

[Verse 5: Pharoahe Monch]
From Freaky Tah to 2Pac to Chinx to Christopher
Is it the liveliest while I still strive?
So obvious at 25 while I'm alive
Sit in the house of representatives and still won't die
(Buck, buck, buck, buck) Fuck diplomatic immunity
For the straight or the LGBT community
The monotonous non-stop preposterous
Second amendment or degradation of chakras
That's why America prepares bombs
We'll slice the limbs off a grizz-e-ly
To bear arms, who shot ya?
