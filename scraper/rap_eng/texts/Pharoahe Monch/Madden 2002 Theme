* theme for Madden 2002 on Playstation 2

[Pharoahe Monch]
Unravel the world of John Madden 2002
Y'all playas need to switch up ya offensive patterns
Before they break from the huddle, I read their thoughts
Pharoahe Monch, hail mary, EA Sports
The defense impregnable, plays all legible
The tolerance to withstand pain is un-measurable
Heat, rain, snow, sleet, hail
You leave it all on the field and you're bound to prevail
The All-Madden free safety tracking ya pass
We hate artificial surface, love natural grass
Don't let my squad get to whippin' on ya natural ass
The agony of defeat it's all factual
Frustration (Come on), aggrevation
On the sideline when I'm pumpin' my fist in celebration
I thirst for first downs, I burst through the middle
Jiggle a bit, give em' some speed before they hit you
Who's standing still at the end of two-minute drill
Who has the heart to win it all, who has the will
John Madden 2002
Pharoahe Monch about to bring it to you, I'm saying
John Madden, EA Sports
Y'all better play hard don't take no shorts
Say, John Madden, EA Sports
Y'all better play hard don't take no shorts
Come on
