[Verse 1]
You really ain't the type of girl that I'm used to seeing
Fine as hell, cool with a job and not the slightest bit conceited
Plus you seem like the type of girl that's going to handle her biz
And I'm definitely the type of dude that's going to handle his
Say, baby maybe I can interest you in a drink
Baby, maybe, I can help figure out why you're having all them problems
Seems so evident to me why it's so hard
See, it's right there in your face when you look in the mirror

[Chorus]
You intimidate every dude
You meet because you're so, so damn
Fine, fine, fine
And it's the one thing you hate 'cause they
Would know how cool you were if they took
Time, time, time, time

[Verse 2]
You're probably the sweetest thing that I've ever met
Keep your nails done, hair done, hustling, ain't scared to bust a sweat
You got a heart as big as my grandmama's from down south
A smile on your face, but your heart still wears a frown
Let me see if we, let me see if we
Turn it upside down, turn it upside down
And build a new you from the ground, up up up up up
Give you new reason to smile
Smile smile smile
Tell these dudes gone man up and quit playing

[Chorus]
You intimidate every dude
You meet because you're so, so damn
Fine, fine, fine
And it's the one thing you hate 'cause they
Would know how cool you were if they took
Time, time, time, time

[Verse 3: Pharoahe Monch]
I think I can, the little engine that could I'm tired of stalling
Spider webs, frog hairs, you finer than all them
Weak pick-up lines, for them you not falling
They try to run them by you, but you not from New Orleans
Hustling over time on that late night grind
Even when you sick as a dog you're nothing less than a nine
Finish my sentences, you be revealing my thoughts
With or without the weave I think I'm feeling it short (bald headed)
See, in a realm of women with no soul
You kinda put me in the mind of Thelma from Good Times
Fine, firm, feminine, no perm
Design your own fashions and willing to learn
Eager to teach with no sedatives
Your lips look like a positive magnet, mine are the negative
Now, now tell me how you find that
I, I, I, I wanna get behind that

[Chorus]
You intimidate every dude
You meet because you're so, so damn
Fine, fine, fine
And it's the one thing you hate 'cause they
Would know how cool you were if they took
Time, time, time, time
You intimidate every dude
You meet because you're so, so damn
Fine, fine, fine
And it's the one thing you hate 'cause they
Would know how cool you were
