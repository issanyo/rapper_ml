[Intro:]
Shake, shake [x5]

[Verse 1:]
Get them up ma Shake with this beat and the cut
Man I love a senorita with a struct
I’m a boss Casanova
On it to be known and a sauce that’s sweeter than a Japanese at kita palm
Her name is Rita, chrome piece from medina
With enough cool oh to do Judo on your peter patter puff
Mama me your feet look diamond in the rough
Tore off my wife beater as I’m climbing in your truck
She’s coasting with a selfish track
Young hoe unlimited, boomerang bending it, killing it
Hard body sex extending it
Met her by the swerve thirty third and lex tennamin
Shaking that ass we’ll be out for a splash
In a juke joint jam long twist on the glass
Senorita is first class beautiful like water in a rubus deuce
Swimming with this chocolate down her cooler
Smash, smash
What!
Yeah
Uh
Oh, no
Oh see, Prince Po
Yo
Smash

[Chorus:]
Gonna  ride
Don't stop
Smash
Uh, uh , uh, uh

[Verse 2:]
Still a fly young OG
No need for name dropped it while I proceed
Nah!
Statute es DYT
It better be known if Y’all under age please show me ID
Allow me to do my thing career long
If yall mixed, arm length tell her to take just far beyond
So lets be honest my team mixed matched with legal dudes to convicts
It’s oh no
Celerios better yet
Better get y’all up on the dance floor
Prince put in the call for me to show up
Me plus 2 when I roll up
Fly with it I wear chop gear New York back when I ride
The valet park my ride
DJ announce when I enter
No one in advance
Believe we got this shit on smash
Smash

[Chorus]
Uh, uh
Get it
Uh
Smash
Smash Smash[x3]

[Verse 2:]
Ash Smash
Slow down girl I’m tryna get involved
Slow down girl it’s also way we say
Now baby i’ll slow
Slow down girl
I could shake up the town and bang that fast
Her ass ass crazy ass stacey dodged his
Plastic or not God should’ve have made them all plastic
Vast
Think he shoulda made a billion like this
Then men wouldn’t have to ration class
If she’s intelligent then she will increase my diction
Poke fiction, coke flick coke
Smash
Culprit passion, adult swim, trash
I started singing them older men songs to this athletic chic with yoga pants on
And she had a yoga matt a lied told her that I always wanted to try beat crumbs
She said I don’t believe you touch your toes
I said the sidewalk is not for teaching
Yo, she had a onion, no backbone
Off the bat had it down with the OG dog hat though
105 degrees heat in the studio
Couldn't breathe for shit but looking at the booty though
Judy truly knows how to stretched do her duty though
So after class so they sex in the movie oh smashed
Now baby i'll slow it down come on baby
Mhhhh yes ha ha
Bring
My ninjas are dangerous
