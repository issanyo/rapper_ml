[Intro/Chorus]
We all come united as one, revel in
The brethern, the medicine men
Lock a big piece down straight severin
Never settlin for less like a veteran
Then react to our built format
'Til death play its part and we transform back
To the essence until then our presence is all that
We seizin 40 acres right the fuck off the map

[Verse One]
(Now who's the first incision it's an interlocked position) Indeed!
Flexin a lie, spittin and switchin on positions
Coverin the strong safety, bubblin in Macy's
Lacin tracks by Niq, the antidote is complete
The bass like the chisel, crash the walls of the Jeep
Delight in personnel as they romp in the street
Intent is to bend, non-understandin in those that peep
Automatic is static across the beat

[Verse Two: Pharoahe Monch]
With vintage fortified material antiques for lyrical
Shit I can feel the vibe inside my soul like a spiritual sermon
Never difficult to determine, examine
My verbal prognosis easily equals that of a blast from a cannon
(BLAOW!) So fuck chronic

[Verse Three]
It's the deadly demonic, I'm playin hydroponic
That make a nigga and his man react, like they supersonic
It's the lyrical program murder assault area
Shake crack, shatters down barriers

[Verse Four: Prince Poetry]
Ghetto life in the form of a SCUD missile (hittin ya area)
Heat-seakin where are ya, infrared rays are starin ya
Down to wear out your movements in spirit and sound
True and living

[Chorus]

[Verse Five: Prince Poetry]
We still remain rough rugged still strugglin jugglin bombs
Shovin in Tommy riddle times are troublin we still bubblin
The black magic without, magic wands, the bonds we on
Droppin mega jewels on third eyes like smart bombs

[Verse Six]
Now most kids can't figure the fudge, they can't deal with
My vertical liftoff, or poison progress
Attack future fighters laser light point dot is
Hostile radar (and move on any invader)

[Verse Seven]
They're merkin, awkward shadows are clerkin
Lurkin from resistin in arrest, put in my 10, I'm workin
For the ultimate hurtin, my steel curtain
Will block your entourage, sincerely, for certain

[Verse Eight]
So how you prove who you are? (Who you are?)
We got inidividuals, mentals mixed with visuals, subliminals
Attributed to, love and understanding for my group
Bassline tragedies over mackadocious loops
Lackin the notions, motions granted we hopin
(And just copin to exist with lyrics that's like mist)

[Verse Nine: Pharoahe Monch]
Estabalition, cinco, seperate accounts, Swiss
Five individual rollos, ex..quisite isn't it
Type riveting visiting us at the OK Corral
Pivoting on the axis of earth, we givin birth
To all new types of angles (all new types of angles)
Stranglin the President and burnin the star spangled

[Chorus]
