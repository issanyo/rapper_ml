[Intro]

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
Dear Mom
Alana's is in her second trimester
Stressed out, cos' I'm gone
She actin' all extra
But happy cause she knows it's a girl
But we're doubtful if we should bring another one in the world
The pics you sent with you and the kids are the bomb
I'm keepin all my photos in my 23rd Psalm
My best friend Armani lost her arm at the border
Just tryin to restore a little peace and order, and it's
Strange because she reads the Qu'ran
Torn between what side she needs to be on
Haven't slept for days
I squeeze Visine
Cause no man's eyes should see what I've seen
Soldiers lost their mind
Robbin', pillagin'
Tomahawk missiles in civilian villages
And they ease the pain with narcotics
I'm scared but I'm trying to remain patriotic

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
My Father
Forgive us cause we know not what we're doin'
And my brothers
How we gonna tie up all these loose ends?
And my mother
Tryin' to use that thing you taught me to keep it movin
And my brothers & sisters
How we gonna tie up all these loose ends?

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
New message from mom
At bring back the troops dot com
At home they comparing this situation to 'Nam
So sad you had to miss your mom's prom
She sung songs off the Marvin Gaye Whats Going On album
And her smile lit up the room
She asked me
"If at night would she stare to the moon?
Is it possible at the same moment in time
You're staring as well cause you too were in tune?"
Your dad's Purple Heart now hangs over his ashes
I dream he's alive and wake up with hot flashes
They claim that his disease was gastric
Have yet to explain the migraines and rashes
And have you seen what the price of gas is?
We can't afford the property taxes
We just want you back at home
Where you belong with your family, you're the backbone

[Hook]

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
Tell me how can we live this way
We've gon so far astray
No one knows what to say
We got young people's lives at stake
What is it gonna take
For us to find our way

[Verse 3: Will.I.Am]
The world is changin'
We in danger
Cause we ain't changin' our behavior
We behave like calm is nothing
Ain't concerned with repercussions
Ain't that something? Check 'em out now
Pointing fingers when they know how
We got to this point of terror
Precaution could have made the road clearer
But we stuck with mediocre leadership
So we'll just suffer
Who knows what the hell is going on
But conflicts they keep on growing
It's a -- situation
When you ain't got no education on the problem
Or know what its about
You gotta help me out

[Outro: Sergio Mendes (keyboard solo) and Justin Timberlake (vocals)]
