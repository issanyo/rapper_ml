Knock Knock. Got rhymes over Rock on lock
In stock - Bless up Pac &; Scott La Rock
Shell shock - a phony in the ring ...Let him realize
Call me Robert McCall when I Equalize
Livin’ in a cinematic window of time
Make every little syllable rhyme I’m winnin’ with mine
And an anomaly I be with Jabari Ali sonically like you sniff Wasabi
Velocity captures the rapture Fracture these rappers
Attack ‘em like velociraptors
Animal Savages damagin’ everything average
Like cannibals ravagin’ tearin’ up blendin’ in languages 
I'm out of category
Transcribe allegory of bitumen
The art of gorillas in the mist
Part of the bled to be seen worldwide
They say my verb treated like a diamond from Serra Leone
I touch people like a Parabellum The story will tell me like a peplum

Y’all wanna act blind and watch the white ball shoot the 8ball in the side pocket
And all the while the red and the blue ball is feeling like the cue ball way out of pocket pocket
If the colored balls screw the cue ball it’s toxic toxic WATCH THIS!
I’m a mother f**kin’ rockstar on the top of a cop car with a Molotov cocktail
F**k a liquor store let’s loot a Walmart, take everything that we need
Watch this
Crush Slash Break Smash
Professional protagonist f**k a protest just proceed
Watch this!!!

See where I’m from
We don’t run
We don’t hide
See where I’m from
We don’t run

Same place where the rhymes invented
Be a condo with nuthin’ but condoms in it
All do is rap and f**k, give da girl a stroke
STIX be flowin’ like the levees broke
... I bet she ...get high ... I’m the anecdote
In her ... thick thighs - watch her overdose
Feel the riptide, see I’m from the east side
Watts ni**as see signs like a horoscope ni**a
... I’m on my toes like Mike
STIX get the bag then I spend like Mike, jack son
And then I’m back son, stay off the wall, aye I’m bad son
Pick of the litter, aye I’m that ni**a aye f*ck that b*tch, never lose I winner
Hey sim simmer, got the keys to the Beamer, the car dashing, word to Bruce Jenner
