[Amy Winehouse]
They tried to make me go to rehab
I said no, no, no
Yes I been black, but when I come back
You won't know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go

[Pharoahe Monch]
Pharoahe Monch, let's go, get it, oh no no no no no I can't go go go to rehab you'd just be mad
Drunk in the lobby Pharoahe just might hurl place me with these snobby white girls
12 step program Lindsay Lohan, cold and bitchy Nicole Ritchie, Skin and bones so thin and see
Through what the fuck we have I'll feed you
Even, believe it anorexic wash their mouths with
Antiseptic
No grey goose I won't except it, they say Pharoahe is too eclectic
Prescription drugs, Anna Nicole Smith
Silicosis is what I roll with, pass that hit, let me roll 1
Escape with Mary Kate Olsen

E-tap take an extra Motrin, wash that down with a Molson golden
Sit me here with Britney Spears when rehab really does what what what what?
But make you misplace underwear
And get her really fucked up plus cut cut cut
Make you misplace underwear
And get her really fucked up plus cut cut cut cut
They tried to make me go to rehab I said no no no
I'll take my black ass to rehab there's no hydro dro dro

[Amy Winehouse]
I ain't got the time
And if my Daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go
The man said, why you think you here?
I said, I got no idea
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near
He said, I just think you're depressed
Kiss me, yeah baby
And go rest

They tried to make me go to rehab
I said no, no, no
Yes I been black, but when I come back
You won't know, know, know
I don't ever wanna drink again
I just, ooh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend 10 weeks
Have everyone think im on the mend
And it's not just my pride
It's just 'til these tears have dried

[Pharoahe Monch]
They gave me crystal meth and E-tabs I said no no no
I'll take my black ass to rehab there's no hydro dro dro

[Amy Winehouse]
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine

[Pharoahe Monch]
Try to take my black ass to rehab
I won't go, go, go
