[Intro: Narrator]
Where most niggas would stop, he would just be gettin started
Go all out, I seen people stop in mid-stride
Reverse, change directions
Go through buildings to avoid passing him

[Hook: Organized Konfusion - mostly Prince Poetry]
Nine times out of ten, a nigga wanna shine
But nobody shines brighter than the light Organized
Extra-tight, one hundred percent, drama full armor
The persona is to "Crush Kill Destroy" the bad karma that
Hums superb, lyrics emerge from the slums
Of the latest gun drug runs, fun feds and dum-dums
Priority and confidential
Organized mission is ripping any instrumental, believe that

[Pharoahe Monch]
Wa-wa-wa-wa-watch me-me-me get-get me-me so-so-in-in-incred-
-di-di-di-dibly-bly-bly ov-bly-bly over your head, head
I shed styles like reptile skins
While nigga rhyme the same, rip beginnin to the ends
Of they LPs, try to tell me shit
With they pussy-ass poems and they bullshit (bullshit) skits
Shit I'm hitting you harder than Nancy Kerrigan on the shin
Fuck it if niggas can't comprehend

[Prince Poetry]
Fuck yo, consider me iller than ill, with skill, nigga chill
Still, some sleep, too deep, not to get bitten
When I reveal technique - wherever I speak
I'm goin in for the kill, for real
Future street prodigy follow the model is hollow
Speak your name if your lyrics hold sorrow
Ain't that a damn shame?
Konfusion with the K and whole effects like rain
With acid from tomorrow, Prince Poe Bizarro
Maintains the status, apparatus throughout the stratosphere
Here stands one of the biddest
City crispy rhyme rebels clear like crystal
O.K. be the initials, ghetto dope officials

[Hook: Organized Konfusion - mostly Prince Poetry]
Nine times out of ten, a nigga wanna shine
But nobody shines brighter than the light Organized
Extra-tight, one hundred percent, drama full armor
The persona is to "Crush Kill Destroy" the bad karma that
Hums superb, lyrics emerge from the slums
Of the latest gun drug runs, fun feds and dum-dums
Priority and confidential
Organized mission is rippin any instrumental, believe that
