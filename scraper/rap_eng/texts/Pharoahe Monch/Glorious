[Intro]
Ladies, just clap your hands to the beat
Snap your fingers like this one time
Lay back, just clap your hands to the beat
I love you

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
These three words I said right after she gave me
Then she turned around and blazed me
Had me, reflect me, eternally [?] self
Nursed my asthmatic ass right back to health
Put me on a path of righteousness
The advice she gives [?]
Help me defeat the beast find peace with me
Show Pharoahe how to release his chi
She marches, tripping the life fantastic
But the brand new accomplish, she's so

[Hook: Sa-Ra]
Glorious, in the spirit, in the mind
In the body, in the soul, on the block with the Glock
When she rock then she roll
She holdin' in down, she holdin' the ground
She's so glorious

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
See I got out of hand no [?] just swats
And no dime's [?]
My peoples always say "Don't play that hand
Those three words, never say that, man
She might be a magician on a late night scam
[?] on some long term plans and
You're a grown man, she's tryin' to seduce your
Soul like a devil dead clone transported from Japan"
That's why you've been shot me in my ass with an arrow
We was playing bridge like [?]
Horizontally cars like [?]
The Pharoahe to travel to what the love and [?]

[Hook]
