[Verse 1:]
You really ain’t the type of girl that I’m use to seeing
Fine as hell, cool with a job and not the slightest be conceited
Plus seem like the type of girl that gonna handle her business
And I’m definitely the type of dude that's gonna handle his
Say baby maybe I can Interest you in a drink
Baby, maybe, I can help figure out why you're having all them problems
Seems so evident to me why it's so hard
See it's right there in your face when you look in the mirror

[Chorus:]
You intimidate every dude you meet because you're so so damn fine, fine, fine, fine
And it's the one thing you hate cause they would know how cool you were if they took time, time, time, time

[Verse 2:]
You're probably the sweetest thing that I've ever met
Keep your nails done, hair done, hustling, ain't scared to bust a sweat
You got a heart as big as my grandmama's from down south
A smile on your face but your heart still wears a frown
Let me see if we...turn it upside down
Turn it upside down and build a new you from the ground, up up up up up
Give you new reason to smile,smile smile smile
Tell these dudes gone man up and quit playing

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I think I can the little engine that could I'm tired of stalling
Spider webs, frog hairs, you finer than all them
Weak pick up lines for them you not falling
They try to run them by you, but you not from New Orleans
Hustling over time on that late night grind
Even when you sick as a dog you're nothing less than a nine
Finish my sentences you be revealing my thoughts
With or without the weave I think I'm feeling it short..(Bald headed)
Seeing a realm of women with no soul
You kinda put me in the mind of Thelma from Goodtimes, fine, firm, feminine, no perm
Design your own fashions and willing to learn
Eager to teach
With no sedatives your lips look like a positive magnet
Mine are the negative
Now... now tell me how you find that
I, I, I, I wanna get behind that

[Chorus] [x2]
