[Scratches by DJ Debris]
"Classic example of..." - Q-Tip

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
Now, we bring danger to strangers who claim "to defame the crew!"
Pharoahe, Hilltop Hoods, never singing the blues
Slinging these new singles for you to mingle to
Australian Hip Hop but not kangaroos
Change the game a little, rearrange the rules
Your whole frame is brittle man, you came to lose
We drop classics you bastards
My final four defeats sweet sixteens like March Madness
It's not passive, it's so ravenous
This collaborative effort is not average
It's magnanimous, thus, my little crew got loose screws
These dudes will put two in your cabbage
One in your laminate, three in your manager's Phantom
Don't be a candidate for Animal Planet
Lyrical savages and CD anger management classes
Look how we handle 'em, we leave 'em in bandages damn it

[Hook: Scratches by DJ Debris] + {Pharoahe Monch}
(Classic example!) "I do my thing for real"
(Pharoahe!) "While I cooked up classics" - Common
"The bottom line, my sound system ready to shine"
"While I cooked up classics" - Common

[Verse 2: Suffa]
No stopping us now, Hilltop in this, we locking it down
Apocalypse now, we're not with this monotonous sound
It's innocuous Hip Hop and we're on top of a cloud
Rocking a crowd, dropping this like "Who's not with us now, huh?"
They're all feeling our movement, it's
Got DJs scratching up my shit like removalists
Who is this ludicrous, furious, humorous
Dude that just threw us off the back of a tour bus?
Two of us, "bringing that shit that got your hands clapping!"
Luminous, "swinging my dick like Dr. Manhattan!"
... I had to stop for breath
Cause our shit's like Joan of Arc, man it's hot to death
We blowing up the spot, not once but twice like P-Monch
Blowing up some Reebok pumps when I beatbox
"Come to life!" We'll try get this drunk out of here
My shit's a classic, man get the FUCK out of here

[Hook: Scratches by DJ Debris] + {Suffa}

[Verse 3: Pressure]
This ain't so-so promo, believe me it's pro
Dope flow that don't know the meaning of no
Me and my co., {Pharoahe!} won't be leaving the show
Till the speakers blow from the heat of my flow
"We write classics!" for back alley theatrics
Playing with fire living in a house built with matchsticks
Haters wanna roll with me now, showing love
Guess I'm just too busy holding it down to hold a grudge
Your average amateurs panic and choke
They ain't actually dope, they're high on cannabis smoke
I'm still the man if I don't blow a grand on a rope
Cause fortune favours the brave, that's why these rappers are broke... huh
Props to Nu-Mark for jacking the sample
Debris could lay a scratch with his arms full
Keeping heads packed like a carpool
Back for the masses to marvel, here's another classic example

[Hook: Scratches by DJ Debris] + {Pressure}
"I do my thing for real"
(Pressure MC!) "While I cooked up classics" - Common
