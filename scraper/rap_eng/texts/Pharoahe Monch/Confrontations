[Prince Poetry]
Yo grip, you got your eyes fixed on me like as if a bitch
Caught me in a glitch reachin at cases no beef just fish
Straight pitch, what the fuck is the problem? You and your man

[Pharoahe Monch]
Yo move back, y'all rap niggas take this shit too far
I'm like an ox, brother my box-cutter leavin a scar
All my peoples are connected
That shit y'all spit on records is infected and dead
You'll get injected with lead
Ain't no need for me to sweat no man, my crew makes stacks
You just be black and ass nigga plus your records is whack
You'll get fucked up (I'll get fucked up? Nah I don't think so money..)

[Prince Poetry] + (Pharoahe)
Violatin my 360, his niggas started revolvin
That problem needed quick solvin so we started to brawlin
(Combinations of haymakers deleted all of the stallin)
Callin for nobody, determined just to keep these niggas fallin
(To the big man's ribs) after a left to his jibs
Him and his man transform into these six rowdy-ass kids

[Pharoahe Monch]
I never went since Prince struck first, bitches dispersed towards the corner
Too many enemies for me to overpower
I wanna at, least take one nigga down with me
If I have to go out, I'm goin scrappin no doubt
First nigga up to bat gets bent (bent) pinned (pinned)
Immediately, up against the wall (ha) him (him)
Wig pushed back, thumb to windpipe
Reacts numb his whole face contorts when eyeballs contract

[Hook: Prince Poetry] + (Pharoahe Monch)
When shit comes down to it, no hesitation
Actions speaks louder than words in all situations
Do what we gotta do, set it off, let it loose
Fuck it, we ready for confrontation
(When shit comes down to it, no hesitation)
(Actions speaks louder than words in all situations)
(Do what we gotta do, set it off, let it loose)
(Fuck it, self-preservation)

[Prince Poetry]
I can't believe these whack rap niggas is swingin on me
The dark-skinnned kid caught me in the eye now I'mma bring it to G
I square him up while Chuck tries to trip him, fuck he's too fast
Over the top, duck, champagne and the glass struck
Now Moet's all over the floor and I'm slidin through it
Pharoahe I got your back, splittin him, exposin bodily fluid
From fraudulent foes, with points to prove, and no holds barred
Raw dog like out in the yard

[Pharoahe Monch] + (Prince Poetry)
I'm peepin out how their security maneuvered and selected
In multiples of 3 random niggas end the beef to be ejected
Collected my thoughts, connected with members of medicine men
Who explained to me that DT's got the block locked seized
They wouldn't let us in
Sighed, slide to the midstream, plus swallow your pride
(This is the second time swine, one-time, had to spoil it)
Pull the lids on the commode and drop the Glocks inside the toilet
If we, move swiftly, we just might make it
If the opportunity arise to bounce, let's take it

[Hook]
