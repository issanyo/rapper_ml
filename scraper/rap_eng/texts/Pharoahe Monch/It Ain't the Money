[Macy] Heart of mine, milk and honey
It ain't the money, now we know
Doin' lines, ain't it funny
It ain't the money, now we know

[Pharaohe Monch]
After the money they lust
Sell their souls for the unlimited cash flow
In God we trust but that's never in class though
Enron, WorldCom, CEO assholes
A Monopoly to collect whenever they pass go

Big screen TV's, nigga please
There will be no alerts before they search and seize
13 hours in the seal with the 13 leaves
13 steps that it takes to see 13 thieves

[Macy]
Hidee high, lowdy low
Get up and go to the show
Every time I get low
Get up and go to the show

[Pharaohe]
I fell in love with her once, she was evil, I remember
Her 18th birthday she became legal tender
Some say she heaven-sent with skeletons in her closet
Traded herself for drugs and stayed inside of my wallet

I know women who couldn't have her who became alcoholics
In the fetal position bent over toilets
And calling for earl with pains in their bladder
So, people listen, when I tell you, it really don't matter

[Macy]
Betcha giving head to a movie star
Betcha got a llama riding in your car
Betcha got a TV built in your jet skis

Betcha giving head to a movie star
Betcha got a llama riding in your car
Betcha got a TV built in your jet skis

Hidee high, lowdy low
Get up and go to the show

[Beck]
Ain't it funny how the money
Makes the honey taste like nothing
You can't have no more, now we know
(Now we know that it don't mean nothing)

[Macy]
Peace of mind, fill my tummy
It ain't the money, now we know
Hard to find, got my something
It ain't the money, now we know
(Now we know that it don't mean nothing)

Hidee high, lowdy low
Get up and go to the show

[Beck]
Ain't it funny how the money
Makes the honey taste like nothing
You can't have no more, now we know
(I'm in the kitchen cooking up food)
Now we know
(Now we know that it don't mean nothing)
