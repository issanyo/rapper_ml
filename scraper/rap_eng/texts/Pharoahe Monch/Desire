[Chorus: Showtyme]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Said, it's my desire, yes it is, yeah
Yes it is, yes it is, oh yeah, yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Pharaohe Monch]
Comprehend the guidelines
My chest out, chinchilla, all relaxed on the sidelines
I'm so famous, understand
New York City respects my game like Joe Namath
And I protect my name like your anus
In prison, y'all don't hear me, y'all don't listen
Y'all just wanna shine, y'all just wanna glisten
Floss, knowing that the soul is still missing
(Who am I?) I'm the poetical pastor
Slave to a label, but I own my masters
Still get it poppin' without artist and repertoire
'Cause Monch is a monarch, only minus the A&R
When my brain excels, your train derails
Pop shit, make you feel the Clipse like Pharrell
You will feel me, you will admire
My struggle, my hustle, my soul, desire

[Chorus: Showtyme]
Ooh, oh, yeah
Said, it's my desire, yes it is, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Said, it's my desire

[Verse 2: Pharaohe Monch]
My book is a ovary, the pages I lust to turn
My pen's the penis, when I write, the ink's the sperm
Desire, the fire that ignites the torch to burn
This is not rocket science, this is easy to learn
My mic's the gavel, when I talk, court's adjourned
Respect, even if you were ashes, you couldn't earn
I embody antibiotics, you are infected with germs
Rap's fatally ill, please get concerned
Players pick turns to play, get burned
I color commentate the game like Chick Hearn
This is the moment of truth for my opponents and liars
Vocals alone invoke the emotion of black choirs
Fire, you don't wanna get burned like Rich Pryor
Move back, who's that there? The live wire
You will feel me, you will admire
My struggle, my hustle, my soul, desire

[Chorus: Showtyme]
Ooh, oh, yeah
Said, it's my desire, yes it is, yeah
It's my desire, keep pushin', keep strivin'
My passion, my fire, that's my desire
I keep pushin', I keep strivin'
That's my desire, I keep pushin', I keep strivin'
That's my desire, I keep pushin', I keep strivin'
