[Intro: DJ Revolution]

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
Lyrical phenom, an enigma
Light years and eons; beyond
What you comprehend through modern day radio and television
Servers, I pee on, like R-Kelly women
In the limelight I’m primetime like Deion
Through the fog I shine like X-5 Xenon
Pharoahe Monch as a Sphinx
Probably thinking more along the lines of Spinks like Leon
I’m on some queen shit, (c’mon) I’m on some queen shit, (c’mon)
You fuck around and get your faggot-ass spleen split
When on the mic, I’m not the type to intervene wit’
Jamaican house pays the [?] I mean shit
I slash half assed rappers in the face,] and leave deep gashes
I’m Hot!
Give me room to rock, I give heat rash
This the beat bastards?
The master flow Jurassic
Walking over water and drinking forties on acid
The masses know the name alone agreed to blast it in the brains
Disastrous, leave them battered and flabbergasted
Multiple clashes with a hazardous man
Whose hand crafted rap thrashes theirs
Your honor, I’ve seen past it
My aura's like a vorous
Rappers need a thesaurus
Pharoahe put fire to that ass like menorahs
And your chorus is bound to pull us
Need to learn, it's my turn
Niggas-a-need to get some burn like phosphorous
