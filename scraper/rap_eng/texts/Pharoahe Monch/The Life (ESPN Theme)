[Pharoahe talking]
The life, uh-check it, yeah, come on
Pharoahe Monch, Tribeca, Major League
What's the deal now come on

[Hook: Pharoahe]
My life is all I have
My ball, my pen, my pad
And I done made it through the struggle, don't judge me
What you say now, won't budge me
Cuz where I come from, so often
People you grew up with are layin in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain that's life
It's my time now, my world, my life
My life!

[Verse 1: Tribeca]
Yo, the greatest of all time
Look at the world, it's all mine
On top of my game, no... top of my name
Went from rockin the boat to coppin a plane
I'm so vain, went from Dightman to Hynesman to goin pro
Went from ?bumboos? to sunroofs and throwin dough
Now I'm laid back, thinkin "Oh, my life is sho'"
Look at my crib, look at my fridge, I was so po'
But I graduated, no longer agitated
Yo I'm glad I made it, that's "Toast!" to those who hated
Look at my life, look at my wife, dawg - I'm so rich
Look at my kids, without family I'm hopeless
I hope you knows this
Come follow my life, right

[Hook: Pharoahe]
My life is all I have
My ball, my pen, my pad
And I done made it through the struggle, don't judge me
What you say now, won't budge me
Cuz where I come from, so often
People you grew up with are layin in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life
My life!

[Verse 2: Tribeca]
Yo, what will the sport be without me?
I got six rings, six championships - Clinching
Big things, got a sneaker line that's retro-fitted
Might catch you in it? - Nah, your game too timid
Might move your pivot
I need a dresser pose like Ray Allen and Eddy Jones
I need Derrick G to Michael Philly - hot like fever
I need a knock-out king that's outboxing
Outfoxing, got knees locking
This game we play's like similar to life
Similar to Christ, similar to ice
If you split you fall, you are no longer God
My life was so hard, I'm glad I had sports y'all

[Hook 2: Pharoahe]
My life is all I have
My skills, my hops, my jab
And I done made it through the struggle, don't judge me
What you say now, won't budge me
Cuz where I come from, so often
People you grew up with are layin in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life
My life!

[Verse 3: Tribeca]
Yo, I write conceit to both the Stanley Cups to amateurs
To the least ?Ironbergs? in the world that manage us
Injuries that damage us, man it's rough
Do we still get paid for that day, that ?cannon bust?
Will I ever play a sport again with lavishes?
What team are we tryin to adjust, my ?Afro gents?
If God answers me "No"
When will I blow? Where will I go?
Who will it be who's givin aid?
That chance to roam in the gain, throw back my pain
Retrack my fameless name
Uh - in the gym, overweight, 'gain and again
Getting my offence right, gotta better my life - Yup

[Hook 2: Pharoahe]
My life is all I have
My skills, my hops, my jab
And I done made it through the struggle, don't judge me
What you say now, won't budge me
Cuz where I come from, so often
People you grew up with are layin in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain that's life
It's my time now, my world, my life
My life!
