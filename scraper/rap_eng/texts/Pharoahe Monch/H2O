[Sample]
Memories, like the corners of my mind
Misty watered colored memories
Of the way...

[Intro]
The good old days
Reflect with me
You know what I'm sayin'
We just sittin' on the porch
In Watts
Helicopter flyin' overhead
Lil niggas in the street throwin' dirt rocks
Feel me


[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
Archaeological logic, discovered Van Gogh's fossils
To paint a perfect picture
Twelve years a slave, twenty years a spitter
Thirty seven years a nigga
Hopin' to see ninety bein' a strong black figure
As I stand and deliver
Breathe fire in Japan, Godzilla
By popular demand till the fans see that God got iller
I'm like Cornel West with scales on my chest
You superman thugs, caught Kryptonite to the flesh
See the hood got me stressed, takin fists to the neck
Multiple arrest then I discovered KRS
Let us begin, what, where, how or why
Will all be explained and if not, fam we die
Losin' granny was the hardest
Good women I fucked and left broken hearted
Turned up being retarded
Transformation to activist from an artist
Like young Malala who the Taliban would target
Shot in the head just cause she wanted to read
Till every person sex trafficed is free, we gotta bleed
(Turned down for what?)
Cause niggas tell on themselves nowadays
Film it on Vine then wonder why crime don't pay
Candid outlandish, the dirty pistol I brandishe
Glad they didn't have camera phones when I was young doin' bad shit
Yeah, I just dated myself
I'm no spring chicken but why you hate on yourself?
For five minutes of fame
Find yourself like Kat Stacks, knocked out the frame
Locked in a cage
And bitchin' it's true, you backwards hustlin' homie, you snitchin' on you
I'm on my Descartes, Diop, Be-Bop, Aristotle
Prehistoric talons twist the top off the bottle
My era is classic Tyrannosaurus Rex in the lab shit
Leimert Park so I pass it Jurassic

[Hook: Rakaa Iriscience]
I can think back but life goes on so keep livin'
Can't take a thing back but life goes on so keep livin'
There are couple things, that maybe I would if I could
Forgive myself for, I'm unforgiving
Yeah, I throw this drink back but life goes on so keep livin'

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
In order to recollect exceptional memories
I developed a way to transform brainwaves into binary code from energy
Translate algorithms, converted the information to digital
Uploaded compiled files of wisdom
Then projected them on a screen, vivid beautiful scenes
Extract orchestrated symphonies and heavenly dreams
The alchemist
In kindergarten when kids was asking about alphabets
I was immaculate with astronomy, mastering calculus
Seized from my parents during a scene when I was seven
They experimented on my brain up until I was age eleven
And at age thirteen I learned to literally stream
Molecules and teleport molecular structures with the beam
These are my memories, soak them in with a notion
To fast forward the bad and play the good in slow motion
Now I astral project
Analyze Guam
Study Agent Orange bring back secrets from 'Nam
The government asked me to track the locals on Islam
They asked me the whereabouts of Boko Haram
And cracked my brain for catastrophic chatter that's insane
To extract data from satellites on missin' Malaysian planes
My memories, my memories, my memories
Although from only just a week ago
My memories, my memories, my memories
