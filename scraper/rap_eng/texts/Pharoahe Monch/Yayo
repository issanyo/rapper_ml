[Verse 1]
Melodic embargo, please you know what’s in the cargo
I ship keys my nigga never eat escargot
Key a cops car cop keys in Key Largo
Queens get cheese we don’t bang
Y’all niggas get caught with the keys and all sing
Singing ass niggas be out of key, you can’t hang
The whole key to why shits fucked up in the game now
You’re lame, ya'll get your lyrics from Narcos
Fabulously fabricated crime fantasy Fargo
God bodies behind bars y’all see the bar code
In the 80’s we used to put a little bit in a Marlboro (Keys)
Skinny ones, fat ones, tall ones, short ones, white ones, black ones
Turned perfectly brand new ivory keys into cracked ones
The reason these crack babies can't rap and they act dumb
Now everybody turn up don’t front
Don’t sleep, Let’s eat, Get live, Get crunk
How’s about some hardcore?
Yeah we like it! Yeah we like it raw!
Get money turn a 20 dollar bill into a straw
And just do it! Just do it! Just do it, do it, do it, do it!
Just!

[Chorus]
Yay yo
Yay yo
Yay yo
Yay yo

[Verse 2]
Next to blow, connect get it through Mexico
Instagram shoot yourself, Plaxico
Reduce molecules pass thru Trumps wall with the bass line
Then I’ll inbounds the ball
So nice with the rock that your head might swirl
I’m in the bathroom doing the bump with that white girl
Lines make black chicks bone strangers
The white horse in a hotel room the Lone Ranger (Sniff)
And they try to remain sober
But the hangover got them hanging over the roof on the top of a Las Vegas hotel like The Hangover
Smack, heroin, pcp
I had digital dope before Smack DVD’s
Original Coke before it was Less Than Zero
High like Pacino, Fly like De Niro
Benicio del Toro etc
Maria Full Of Grace on a flight to Kill The Messenger
Cocaine Cowboy
Swerving with that bird in a black suburban merging in Irving Texas, texting serving Michael Irving
Cocaine Cowboy

[Chorus]
Yay yo
Yay yo
Yay yo
Yay yo
Yay yo
Yay yo
Yay yo
Yay yo

(You are now rocking with the best...scratch sample)
