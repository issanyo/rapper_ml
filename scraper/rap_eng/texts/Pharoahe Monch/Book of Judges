[Verse 1]
America the ugly raped my mother
Deceived my sister separated my brother
Murdered my children hung my father
Now they want me to rock the vote the fucks why bother
Seen the commercials for they army or whatever
Picture me giving a damn I said never
My mind's too sharp my brains too clever
My spine is too strong every line pulls your lever
Limitless rhymes for the indigenous the remedy
PLOT! Gettin' my money like the Kennedys
FLIP IT! Put em' in stocks collect anemities
ROCK! roll behold my epiphanies and
Read em' and weep, heat em, I beat em' to sleep
Mislead em' til we even-Steven defeat em' with freedom of speech
And let em' know that I'm the motherfuckin' fire-starter
Piss on the constitution then burn the Magna Carta

[Hook]
All I know is what I feel
Deceive my eyes and distort what's real
Only truth will set you free
I'd rather die on my feet than to live on my knees

[Verse 2]
We dying over black gold they harvesting the sand
Presidents living marvelous they starving in Sudan
It's obvious you walk a blind bath to oblivion
The book of judges read the scriptures unlike Gideon
Light my fire, start my engine
When Pharoahe becomes Moses it's medicine for who listens
A veteran with a mic bringing prophecies to fruition
Motivational verses under adverse conditions
You're, caught in the mainframe I've seen the maze man
They watch you from the streetlights you and your main man
The bar code around your neck same as your name brand
You're lost in a strange land no thoughts of a game plan

[Hook]

[Outro]
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta, Carta, Carta (Fading out)
