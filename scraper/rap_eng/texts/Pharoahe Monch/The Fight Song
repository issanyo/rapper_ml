[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
I see no reason to need to disguise what I am
Or surprise you with a clever rhyme
Allow me to shake your hand before I enter your mind
I'm the amalgomation of pain and fatigue
Culminating in your brain, I'm a disease
You never heard of me, you'll listen
When I attack your spinal cord and weaken your immune system
Excruciating pain, suffering that's atrocious
For the multitude, I'm multiple sclerosis
Vision loss, so frustrating, you'll pull hair
Cramps specifically designed for Duval Clear
I'm bicentennial, I'm possessive
I'm a millenial disease, I'm a progressive
I'm enamored with the relationship
I'm obsessive to the point that I hold on to your joints
And won't let go
Usually move in slow motion
'Til death do us part, now that's devotion
You better be dedicated to sedatives and medication
I meditate, educate you on levitation
I move alone, I work clean
Gang up on your blood and crip you, I'm MS-13
I'm comin' for all races and all rhymers
I'm jealous of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's
Tryin' to take my spotlight like diabetes
I'ma make sure these other diseases can't see me

[Chorus]
I write like it's never the wrong time to right wrongs
For me to push forward the whole night long
So even when I black out, leave the lights on
(Fight song) Fight song
(Fight song) Fight song
I'm livin' life like my eyes might never see the next dawn
So I'ma push forward the whole night long
So even when I black out, leave the lights on
(Fight song) Fight song
(Fight song) Fight song

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
My spine's tinglin', my visions off and my fingers numb
He lookin' for a vicious fight, I'ma bring him one
My killer tape's gonna play loud until Dilla wakes (Wow)
If you want a song that illustrates, I'ma sing him one
A little tune called I'ma fight 'til the final nap
Excruciating is new creations of spinal tap
This kind of rap shows I refuse to be taken out (Fools)
Lost in the woods, I find a map and I make it out
I'm magnetic, it resonates in my imagery
I won't be drained, I know he came for my energy
Ignore the pain, I won't be slain by my enemy
My eyes closed, I'm havin' talks with the inner me
I'm unafraid of any challenge you wanna lay (Unafraid)
In my path, I'm gonna laugh as you run away (Run away)
If I continue to fight hard I will never lose (Never)
The fateful day when I was hopin' for better news
But God blessed me with flip flops to walk in this hip-hop (That's right)
So I can't be prayin' for leather shoes
You might slow me a little bit, but you won't stop me
You might stand in my pathway, but you won't block me
Way back when you didn't know me I wrote sloppy
I tend to write with the inner fight of a broke Rocky
That's the reason I'm focused more when I'm in the gym
'Cause every day is a new chance to go win again

[Chorus]
I write like it's never the wrong time to right wrongs
For me to push forward the whole night long
So even when I black out, leave the lights on
(Fight song) Fight song
(Fight song) Fight song
I'm livin' life like my eyes might never see the next dawn
So I'ma push forward the whole night long
So even when I black out, leave the lights on
(Fight song) Fight song
(Fight song) Fight song

[Outro]
Fight song (Fight song)
Fight song (Fight song)
