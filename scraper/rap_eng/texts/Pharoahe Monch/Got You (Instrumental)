Yeah Yeah
Get your hands up against the wall and spread them

Basically I'm the worst nightmare you ever had
Figure a trigger happy niggaare with a badge
Parading around Los Angeles [Argh!]
High off coke, with a banana clip
Feasting off the weak street of Angeles
With a manuscript, and professional ass whipping

Fuck You [fuck You] fuck You [fuck You]
Understand, I'll never kid around with you
Try to resist I'll dismiss you
Fuck You [fuck You] fuck You [fuck You]
