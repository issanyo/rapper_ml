[Pharoahe Monch]
(Woo)
Yes, sir
Pharoahe Monch, Black Violin
Although the lyrics are transparent, I am not invisible
Lets go

[Chorus]
I’m not invisible
I’m not invisible
I’m not invisible its not my fault you don’t understand
You can pretend not to care
That won’t make me disappear
As I rise it’s clear
Here I stand
Here I am

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
I am not invisible
We are at the precipice of a point that it pivotal
A criminal society of sick individuals
That murder is part of a ritual
Unconventional analogue man in the digital world where there’s no one to listen to
Where they kill us and show us the visuals
Image so unforgettable
Infidels give us the minimal amount while they’re feeding us poisonous chemicals
We are not identical (no)
But I am not invisible (no)
You want me to vanish it’s pitiful
And I don’t understand your subliminal messages
Separatist, sentinels, criminals, I’m not invisible

[Chorus]
I’m not invisible
I’m not invisible
I’m not invisible its not my fault you don’t understand
You can pretend not to care
That won’t make me disappear
As I rise it’s clear
Here I stand
Here I am

[Chorus]
I’m not invisible
I’m not invisible
I’m not invisible its not my fault you don’t understand
You can pretend not to care
That won’t make me disappear
As I rise it’s clear
Here I stand
Here I am
