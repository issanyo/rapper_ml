[Intro: Pharoahe Monch]
It's soul music solely for your soul music
Before it mattered how much we all sold music
From your fitted to your Nike's sole music
It's cheese grits and filet of sole music
This old music sound good don't it?

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
I got a message that I might want to share with you
To show you that I'm hard and
Impeach the president and his government
I voted for God
And I know some how, some way, we all can make it
I got a little information might as well and go ahead and take it

[Hook: Pharoahe Monch]
If we're ever gonna talk the talk, we gotta walk the walk
From the coast of California all the way down to the shores of New York
And I know some how, some way, we all can make it
I got a little information might as well and go ahead and take it

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Open your heart I'm sure you'll find a way to truly get this
That can cure a man from all his disease and from all his sickness
One life, one love, one fight, one struggle, one blood
Hope you can feel it in your bones and if you need it
You can use it anytime of day you want it you can choose it hey
In the morning, in the evening
If you work a 9 to 5 when you leaving
You can share it on the train when you reading
(We must be in love)
Love music, gospel to thug music
Some inspire the soul when they write, some abuse it
I choose to choose what I choose, when I choose it
Put love in the music cause

[Hook: Pharoahe Monch]
If we're ever gonna talk the talk, we gotta walk the walk
From the coast of California all the way down to the shores of New York
And I know some how, some way, we all can make it
I got a little information might as well and go ahead and take it

[Interlude: Pharoahe Monch]
Lord
I know somebody in here feel the love tonight
Please
If you can feel it in your soul and your spirit let me see one hand in the air
Now turn to the person to the right of you and you can tell them
You can tell them
You can say it

[Multiple voices sing, "We must be in love"]

[Hook: Pharoahe Monch]
