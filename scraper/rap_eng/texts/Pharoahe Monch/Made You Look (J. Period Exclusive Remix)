[Intro]
Where them gangster at
Where them dimes at
(J. Period)

Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight you punk asses

Maybach Benz, back seat, tv plasma
Ladies lookin for athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose, whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is, show me love
Lemme feel how the head is
Females whose the sexiest is always the nastiest
And I like a little sassiness, a lotta class
Mommy reach in your bag, pass the fifth
I'm a leader at last, this a don you wit'
My nines'll spit, niggas lose con...
