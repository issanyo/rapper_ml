[Intro]
Ow, okay, long-awaited, highly-anticipated
The new album, "Desire", this is the mixtape
Pharoahe Monch in your area, Clinton Sparks
Boogie Blind, what's good?
We gon' get it, let's go
Mixshooter.com, clintonsparks.com, smashonradio.com

[Verse 1]
So much pain, it's never the pain of a migraine
But the pain of a million slaves slain
And they speak to me, God talks through me
If I'm offending your religion or race, now sue me
Are these the profound words of a prophet for sure?
Does Christopher Wallace play chess with 2Pac Shakur?
We're on the other side of lost souls cryin'
My third eye relies on faith, I keep fire lights
Spirit slash math, on a path to Mount Zion
Hexcel, blow the bell-horse to keep ridin'
My thoughts psychotic at times, who will support it?
Will I ever discuss life with my seed that was aborted?
Does my spirit gets absorbed in a tape when they record it
That's the reason why emcees' lives get shorted
Salvation's worth more than platinum and gold, can you afford it?
It's morbid but I manifest pain and put it in orbit

[Bridge]
I said it's morbid
It's like the other day
I just took the gun from underneath the bed
And... put the barrel to my head
I was just too afraid to pull the trigger, I...
You know it...

[Hook] [x2]
You know it's pain
When you can't see the sun from the rain
You know it's pain
When there's fire in your eyes and you can't see
You know it's pain
When you get down on your knees and pray
You know it's pain
When misery's your only friend

[Outro]
Talk to 'em, Pharoahe
