[Verse 1]
Scene one, The opening shot
We pan across prostitution and crime
This view through the eyes of a child that seen 365 eight times
Pops is scared, the proverbial definition of this __ kid
His mom works _______ things to the bone
48 __ us some she never at home
But she light that ass up, catch that ass lying
Honey with the ____ real cheese with the iron
Screams with the sirens, the murder scenes
It seems his life ____ to one block __ and the gun shots
Plays in the shadows, no need for sun block
Take the heat to Queens last stop, you can come watch
He's intelligent, clever, however
Foot at the bed ______ hands together
He prays, "Father, if you're truly the father
____ wishfull Father"
