[Hook]
I’m in the zone
You already know what it is
I’m in the zone (yeah)
Let’s go cuz you already know
I’m in the zone
You already know what it is
I’m in the zone
And just bounce, everybody bounce

[Verse 1]:
Yo
Shoot me up in the hoop D
I be behind the projects where the broken hoops be
Ghetto children salute me
Because I give em Gucci (c’mon), V12’s (c’mon)
Gas my head, I know the court since the well
Girls try to harass me, grab me, boot me
Guys try to pass me, drop box shoot me
See me in the movies and the hands of jesus
Bring faith to the non-believers, can you believe it
Just bring a street sweeper, so I can break fast
Cuz I don’t need to be busted by the broken (*glass shattering)
Bank on that, then follow it
Give me my props, got top college scholarships
After I made it to the league, you acknowledged it
Well Fantastic, Marvelous!
Satellite Dish, everybody’s watching it
Pass the pill but don’t swallow it

[Hook]
I’m in the zone (Yes sir)
You already know what it is
I’m in the zone (yeah)
Let’s go cuz you already know
I’m in the zone
You already know what it is
I’m in the zone
So just bounce, everybody bounce (c’mon)

[Verse 2]
Impregnable Defense, the triangle is useless
I grew up, Springfield Massachusetts
I blew up and impede, mass produced it
Graphic put the stereo acoustics
He got game, blue chips
Coach Carter said I’m nicer than cornbread
But I’m the fifth, and when they say, “Bitch, Burn instead”
Take you out of your game, get all in your head
I’m yes when I’m good when described by announcers
I was introduced to you by your counselor
30 inch waist, 22 ounces
You’re travelin if you’re movin without me bouncing
I used to be so underhanded
Now I’m above the rim and they demand it
In High Definition, my definition is
All I have is my life, the zone like the twilight

[Hook]
I’m in the zone
You already know what it is
I’m in the zone
Let’s go cuz you already know
I’m in the zone
You already know what it is
I’m in the zone
Just bounce, c’mon bounce c’mon

[Verse 3]
Now you dribbling, and need a defibrillator
Cuz I took your heart, before I made the lay-up
Wait up, straight up, I made it to move that
Broke your ankles, shook you out of your shoes
Whether the streetlight or moonlight, it can be on
Over the car garage, even on the side of a barn
Back you down in the paint, way too strong
Pharoahe Moch, you know the name of the song

[Hook]
I’m in the zone
You already know what it is
I’m in the zone (yeah)
Let’s go cuz you already know
I’m in the zone
You already know what it is
I’m in the zone
Just bounce, c’mon bounce c’mon bounce
