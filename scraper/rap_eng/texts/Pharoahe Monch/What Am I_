[Pharoahe Monch]
You blink, I think with synchronicity
Split my body multiplicity shit
Fifteen places at the same time speaking the gospel
The optical illusion or obstacle, the institution of
Impossible word resuscitation and execution
Electrocution

[High Priest]
Electrocution, emergency broadcast beacon
Reachin' expand the bandwidth stand beyond the abandoned sarcophagus
Brimstone pullin' the esophagus of the dragon breathing apocalypse

[Pharoahe Monch]
Spit, spit out shit shit get incredible responses
From these unearthly creatures and androgynistic monsters
Haunts the every move you make

[High Priest]
Pattern, exorcist, exercise
No discretion when pressing the boundaries
Surround the beat like street lights on nights
With mics and lateral battle moves
To all crews, MCs FREEZE (scratching)

[Chorus]
What am I? What am I? What am I? (x13)

[High Priest]
The acappella block rocker shocker
Off the top of the roof fly MC entity

[Beans]
Me proceed enslave fragment images enhanced by system of our compulsions
Transcriptions transparent as captivity caged by emcees
In flocks of thousands picking at sand!

[High Priest]
The super soaker vein choker, poker-face
Straight hate treads stay red
Dead clouds brought back to life mic majestic untested
Destined to rest among the best of the System Solar
North Polar controller of the mic, MC the battle laser

[L.I.F.E. Long]
The first release quick, kick back the impact
Came in crush on contact knock out your contact when in combat
Called Combaticon causing wreckage pummeling carnage
Carnivorous to con, anti to pop, then apply sauce then chomp

[High Priest]
The to the break of your neck MC
With the impact of a wrecking ball
To the back of the head, Black rocker of rap
Don't look back on my optics
Times two highscore in Galaxian Axiom
Tracks but come more then many
Collision, precision, incision within your skull case

[L.I.F.E. Long]
Necks twist turn off selective words
Earl Blaize double effects you triple take, flex and nerves
Revenge of the nerds seen in blurs
Only the sound of words splurred
Now you remember when men get DIS-MEM-BERED

{SCRATCHING}
What couldn't I say about MCs? x2

[Beans]
Every heart churning insult would be looked as praise for their demise
The bastard owed me his life
Look at everyone hide their celebration by sipping tears from raised champagne glasses
I hope they are buried so deep
Even the worms and the maggots couldn't breathe!

[Chorus]
What am I? What am I? What am I? (x12)
