Alright get the fuck up

Im a gangster thats probably playing with players, I say this with all disrespect cause I only fuck with
Your ladies, its crazy these muh fuckers they always shady, but I love to to stir the pot see all your faces
When I grab the ladel

Independant artist, fuck the label, if I smell a 360 Ill take a shit on your table, I dont ever watch
The cable, unless its round my neck, tied to a sky scraping but im swinginng like spiderman


Oh get the fuck up, before I wake up your mother and tell her that you doin drugs
Wonder what taking 5-6 or 7 does. this kind of love only  comes out when Im kinda buzzzed


Its a crazy concept, I drop the mic and ignite your life, give you a shock like you on the chargers
Im searching every part of, this calm water in your back yard like I have a mental disorder but its kind of
Sort of, like a fight night, hope you can fight right, send you to the bright light, with hit on my pipe
Im set for life, mike, I take the rip and then I take flight, save my whole advance to spend it on a
Nice wife

Now shut the fuck up, before I lose my mind, and I start shooting you taking cover, I got another
Problem with the preme a donas, You making it big by making a single but you know you can't rhyme yeah


Mumble rappers are just a distraction to hide the real shit thats happenin we hustling backwards

Lyricists and MCs are turning over inside they caskets,  you ruining rap and I find your whole life
Os made of plastic, but its fantastic, but Im bringing it back yeah the fastyer we spit these words
As a matter of fact ima bringing the 90s back like I fucking time travlin

Its kind of stupid, drinking this fluid, feeling so boosted I grab the knife  to wifes neck and
Im gonna do it

Im fucking useless, dont know why I always do this, thinking of murder and suicide, till my mind
Is fully lucid

I use my palet to draw me a habit, uncle sam drove me to the back of the ally smoking crack hits

Now keep it clean within the addict, im estatic, the magic,  your girls attracted to me like Im a
Magent, the shit is automatic, I wonâ€™t stop till my name is fucking autographic, but you heard a silent
Tactic

Close your mouth when you see me and just listen i dont got a pot to piss in but im on a suicidle mission

I got this pistol it reminds me of some better days, getting high and driving round with nothing but the the
Basics, get the lasics im on track til im famous, my favorites in heaven hate this but they will love me
When the bass hits

Im just evil motherfucker with a silent motive, currupt the world render you hopeless. dont lose your focus
Cause im here to take your bonus, spend the whole thing on automotives like snapping off the weak within
The lotus
