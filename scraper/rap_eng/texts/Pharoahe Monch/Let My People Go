[Hook]
I'm too high to get over, too low to get under
Let my people go
I'll make you feel so good you don't need to wonder
Let my people go
I'll take away the storm cloud, the rain and thunder
Let my people go
Yeah, somebody say
Let my people go
Huh, somebody say
Let my people go

[Verse 1]
Spit miraculously, sip Dracula's blood exist for centuries
The body chemistry mends wounds, heals injuries
My ministry leaves the industry in a tail spin
Huh, I push the envelope like US mailmen
Huh, we need a leader who is not mischievous
Devious, from Satan’s grip to lead us
Won't retract the facts then act facetious
In fact the raps are packed with facts that teach us
Reach us, easily leave MC's speechless
Read from the palm of the non-believers
Some of them wondering how they become underachievers
One of the best the perennial key note speaker
I got it, You want it, come get it so I’ll flaunt it
And I will show you a way
So let my people go today

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
They’re trying to sell lies to the people huh
Knowing it's hard times for the people huh
I'll knock your ass unconscious
Put it up on Youtube, then film the sequel so it's free for the people huh
Go on ahead and download it I ‘ma teach you how
P is a prophet, a pastor, a preacher
With undisputable logic for blasting through your speaker now
I'm trying to learn your monkey ass, I'm trying to reach you now
But still your like who's this dude
Return to fix, shape the game like Rubik's cube
Chicks see he's brolic now ruthless too
Spit the gospel on wax, what he chooses to do
Damn
Open your eyes man you've been bamboozled
By the usual plans hit up the middle like Stan Musial
If y'all are telling me today's music is suitable and appealing
Then I'm telling you the feelings are not mutual

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Young children pull your pants on up
Who wants to see the crack of your ass and see your butt
You need to let it off, the people go
Past the collection plates and give me all of my dough
And if you’re wondering what’s under my robe
An old rusty ass .38 snub nose
And just because you’re thinking that my shit don't work
That's a (Gunshot)
Go on and try robbing my church

[Hook]
