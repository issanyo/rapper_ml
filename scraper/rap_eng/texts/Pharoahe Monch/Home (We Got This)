We got this, we got this

Let’s do it, let’s do it

[Hook: Tamisha]
Let’s do it, let’s do it
Let’s do it, do it, do it

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch (Phonte)]
I’m at first, at last
Coulda hit home runs but that was all in my past
They say I’m so left field, but it feels so right
They can kiss my ass for real
Listen, this is my word
I know some niggas went to prison for tryna steal third
But still if I get the lead, I’m gone
Halfway to second, just tryna reach home

(Sing it out, sing it out
Better stay on your hustle
Cause you don’t wanna pull a muscle
When you’re playin’ the field)

Home, spirit that makes you
Touch home tune and I just [?] you [?] too
Home, it’s like a spiritual breakthrough
Home, the recognition, it takes two
And that’s us
I put my finger over your lips so your lips won’t talk
Before you even start to speak and say “hush”

[Bridge]
We got this, we got this

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Phonte]
Yo, lil mama say she wanna marry me
But she can’t dismiss our disparity
She say she want a Obama, but I’m an O’Conner
No mama, nothin’ can compare to me
I need rehab, yes, therapy
Cause I’m addicted to the job
And when it comes to work
I beat up the turf like a pair of cleats
Make it sing like a parakeet
You need to be mine
Love’ll have you legally blind
You ask me if I saw them other hoes, nigga, barely
Long as I got you taken care of me
Of course I had somebody when we first met
Do you go shopping for shoes with bare feet?
You already know this
Why you gotta empty the whole clip?
Why you gotta go Pol Pot in the pulpit?
Why you gotta keep bringin’ up all this old shit?
We got this
You see me baby and I see you too
Even when my old girl come up outta nowhere
And pop up in my phone like she U2
I just think about you
We got this

[Bridge] + [Hook]
