[Hook: The Stepkids]
It doesn't take your eyes to see what the paint won't take away
When they take that veil away
We're caught up in the mass confusion
Confused by the Grand Illusion
They're never gonna let you see it
Cause if they did, we'd all be free
We're caught up in the mass confusion
Confused by the Grand Illusion

[Verse 1]
We were told that the Hell below was a fiery inferno
I rediscovered my soul between the lines inside my journal
Trapped within a Penn State of mind, Joe Paterno
External gratification is not happiness eternal
Interject, intellect, intercept, Internet
A slave majority with one percent benefit
Photoshopped images, re-touched photography
Pornography, sodomy, child labor economy
Put away your hope, same political policies
Two-thousand and ten, only minus the space odyssey
There's gotta be a better way, we pray to hit the lottery
We all need a the rapist...
For the robbery of our God, an official public apology
An angel plotted to have Organized Konfusion
You fell for the delusion, I'll expose the movement
Illusion...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Political imcompetent, rhetoric, redundant
Pundit she was fear to control emotions so I'm done with
I reveal a force field for nonsense in my circumference
While we waste resources in abundance
Seventeen-thousand times a day the human eye blinks
Making us even more subjectable to the hijinks
Home alone in my iPad, iPhone, iThink
One world currency, doesn't matter where I bank
There is no pot of gold at the end of a mythical rainbow
We're uneducated contestants, life is the game show
The president is the host, the results are painful
The judges weave a web in which we all get tangled
Their only contribution to the world is a delusion
Which has no physical power, I offer you a solution
Pharoahe Monch, the antonym for translucent
Lyrical revolution, I'll expose the movement
Illusion...
