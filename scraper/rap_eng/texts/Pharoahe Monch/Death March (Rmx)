[Intro: Bernz]
Uh huh
What we have here is a failure to communicate
Come on!

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
(Singing)
Left, right, left
Left, right, left
Left, right, left
Left, right, left
Them: flashing lights and fast cars
Us: gas masks, flash mobs
Riots in Times Square
See, when the educated is unemployed it's unfair
With no visa, I'll devise an escape
Young Caesar, rise of the apes
On top of a police car, pose like the Heisman
Throwing fire bombs at an Exxon advertisement
We are on that check-to-check shit
They are socially disconnected
From the youth who get thoroughly disrespected
See, monkeys receive minimal information
So this, that subliminal renegade shit
For the criminal minded who are tired of slave shit
That Martin Luther King slang sling free speech
Shit you need to learn: no texts, retweet

[Verse 2: Stat Quo]
The agony of defeat
Walking across the beat
Writing my pen on a leaf
Smoking a leaf, seeking retreat
In the nose-bleed seats
The game seem out of reach
But if I dive towards my suicide
The whole game goin' cease
What the fuck wrong wit' him?
Is he on that Whitney or Mike wit' 'em?
Fame will drive you crazy
No license just nights when
You're partying lines on the table
Pills in every color
You're feeling unstable
Screaming out for your mother
Drowning in that puddle
Still waters run deep
Aretha, in the background
Singing fairy-tales, you can't sleep
No logo peak can sow what you reap
From crawling in the deep
And the reaper creep
And barely eat, it eats
At you, it makes you weak
Amongst the meat
Color that's drowning in bleach
Did you find what you see
Covered in a sheet?
Oh my god, it's Sesame Street
Open the gates and let me free
My brain is sayin' to let you be
Can't you see the total fee
To take a life ain't worth the key
To break them lies so it's best that we

[Hook: ¡MAYDAY!]
Death march
Walking towards our demise
I see the cliff, they see my eyes
This ain't a time for goodbyes on a
Death march
Walking towards our demise
I see the cliff, they see my eyes
Nose dive!

[Verse 3: Wrekonize]
Tie an army to your boot straps
Coffee in your blood
Wallet full of food stamps
Pocket full of drugs
Blue prints to move this city from the mud
You get a discount at the morgue, if you're digging yourself up
Yeah, you go ham, I go back bacon
Taking steps towards death and the method is quite back breaking
Show up for dinner like a lab patient
Better yet, a masked Jason
You're pointing at me like "Is that Satan?"
Not in the slightest, lieutenant
Treat my organ like my rifle
I'm a spiteful Lou Bennett
I'm a menace to all ministers
Evident star winners
As vivid as all Genesis
Give me a call, religion engaged
I sip a soda can full of rage
And welcome Death's doorbell ringing on me any day
Modern warfare best believe that many play
I'd rather die amongst the tribe than be alive as any slave

[Verse 4: Bernz]
Counting sheep, not for sleep
Counting them cause so many surrounding me
They walk the streets, they're watching me
Lately I look over my shoulder constantly
Walk in a haze, foggy daze for days
So foggy I can hardly see the nuclear waste
So resorting to drastic measures
Propelling from roofs, cement boots and tarred feathers
La-la-la-lately feel sedated to
Slipping me poison, when I drink your wine and eat your food
Is it enough for you to change my mood?
How does it taste? I think I'd like a se-se-second scoop
How come this whiskey make 'em shifty?
Black-magic addicts signing up early just to get tipsy
My family told me be careful, they know this life's to risky
I told them pay 'em no mind, while we marched in the line

[Hook: ¡MAYDAY!]
