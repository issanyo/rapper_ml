Fuck your bank account, I'm in a gold house
And I'm snorting gold and smoking brussel sprouts

I got a mouth full of gold, I'm 'bout to throw up
And my pinky ring frozen just to show off
Fuck your bottle, we're sipping Fourtays
So much gold around my neck

Gold plated 22's with the platinum automatics
Gotta have it, got to get it, by any means
