Hey guys!
How ya doing today?
It's a nice day
Was that my phone?

Pass me the joint, pass me the weed
It’s summer time, this is how I breathe
When I need some more swishers
And toiletries and Arizona iced tea
Are you with me or a bad bitch or three?
Or a forty ounce on freeze?
Here I come, you won't peep me
'Cause I’m popping out the backseat
Hey, I feel great
I think it's my time, I'm never late
I'm on clock, I'm on top
I'm on a box, my iPhone pop
Shout out to Dr. Seuss
And my friends with the chipped tooth
Aye, and all of you
You're all so cool
Let's hang out soon and smoke a blunt or two
Or do some arts and crafts, I love bubble baths
Don’t you? Let’s get clean
Do you know what I mean? Like a dope fiend

Hey! Where the mouth at?
Hey! Where the town at?
Hey! Where my cash at?
Hey! Where my cats at?

Was that my phone?
Hello?
Oh no, no, no
No, you got the wrong number
I don't even speak that language
What the fuck are you saying?
