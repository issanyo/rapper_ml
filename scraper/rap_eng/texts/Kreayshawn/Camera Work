I got your girl on film and she wanna make a movie
She can be the star and I can be her groupie
Or the director, let me show you how my camera works
I got you in the frame, let me see your camera work

Girls on film and they wanna make a movie
She can be the star and I can be her groupie
Or the director, let me show you how my camera works
I got you in my frame, let me see your camera work

Tell James Cameron to put me on the silver screen
I'm Avatar, blue and need a pocket full of green
As a teen I would capture with a fisheye
On the block gassin' where the bitches cooked they fish fry
I'm flyer than the grease up off your skillet
So hand me any camera and guaranteed I kill it
I film it and they feel it because they got no other choice
I autofocus in, I see her gettin' moist
No voice, I am rolling in that wide Benz
I'm only fuckin' with you if you got a white lens
Bitch, you're fine, you can bring five friends
Or ninety-five blunts, a hundred racks a month
Places everybody, quiet on the set
I need you on your mark honey and yes you're getting wet
My leading lady, you know you're looking extra hot
Take one roll film for the money shot

I got your girl on film and she wanna make a movie
She can be the star and I can be her groupie
Or the director, let me show you how my camera works
I got you in the frame, let me see your camera work

Girls on film and they wanna make a movie
She can be the star and I can be her groupie
Or the director, let me show you how my camera works
I got you in my frame, let me see your camera work

You know my vision blows, I'm so original
I'm in the Bay, smoke a good cow and residuals
I shoot in HD, baby I'm high-def
I'm on the turf hard, I'm talking crime theft
Berkley be in arson, I document 'em all
I'm Quentin Tarantino [?]
And the hood say I deserve an Oscar
Director of the year, Kreayshawn's a little monster
I kill 'em all at Sundance, I kill 'em all at Cannes
I sweep the Golden Globes and I blow a couple grams
In the face of any man who ever try and doubt me
Two thumbs up, my films are so astounding
So holler at me if you're looking for a classic
Or holler at me if you need some pills, weed or that acid
I got it on the low and I'm sure you'll be running back
End scene, Oreo blunt, that's a wrap

I got your girl on film and she wanna make a movie
She can be the star and I can be her groupie
Or the director, let me show you how my camera works
I got you in the frame, let me see your camera work

Girls on film and they wanna make a movie
She can be the star and I can be her groupie
Or the director, let me show you how my camera works
I got you in my frame, let me see your camera work

Let me see your camera work
Let me see your camera work
