[Intro: Kreayshawn]
Go and get ya shine on
Go, go and get ya shine on
Go, go and get ya grind on
Go, go and get ya shine on

[Verse 1: CupcakKe]
Feelin' like a buck, what the fuck you feelin' like? (That money)
Dead these hoes, that's a fuckin' piece of pie
Do it once and it's right, I ain't gotta do it twice
Numbers keep rollin' in like I'm out shootin' dice
Fuck who don't like, I end shit like periods
Bitches crampin' my style like they up on their period
They lazy with the shits, I'm never on bed rest
Keep track of my own money, I don't need FedEx
I keep it wavy like do-rags, bitch, I know that you mad
Walk a day up in my shoes, bet you get a shoe bag
All about a new rack, if you broke move back
Teach 'em how to style, so Louis V. is my school bag
Could take a shit in a tub and I bet these hoes clone it
Callin' me a bro, little hoe, I'm not Jonas
Bitch, I want a bonus, more money, I want it
Work so hard for these coins, my feet got coins on it

[Hook: Kreayshawn]
It's not me who's actin' funny
Since I made a little money
Go and get ya grind on
Go and get ya shine on

[Verse 2: Kreayshawn]
Speedin', another life I gotta live for
I sold my soul six times, I'm tryna get six more
This what we live for, this is our reality
Throwin' dollars in the pot, we brewin' up our fantasies
She said she never smoked and never popped a fizz
But she turn her savage up if you question like a quiz
This is what it is, we all reachin' for the sky
With money in our mind and blood in our eyes
Gotta grind it up till the gears get broken
Water in the garden, better get ya ass growin'
Get ya ass known and you can do it on your own and
Get ya ass blown if you in or set my zone in
Everything I'm ownin', what the fuck is showin'?
You ain't had shit, now you callin' on my phone and
Beggin' me to uber you up to the crib
But I ain't gonna do it 'cause you ain't worth shit

[Hook: Kreayshawn]
It's not me who's actin' funny
Since I made a little money
Go and get ya grind on
Go and get ya shine on

[Verse 3: TT the Artist]
Man, I wanna grind like 24/7
Fuckin' up a check with 6, 7 digits
Need a network like Oprah and Diddy
Movin' on up, got my bad bitches with me
Cake, me and Kreay we be fuckin' up the city
Gettin' paper cuts, paper chasin' for a mili
Shout out to the Bay, to the home of the wire
Gettin' that work, bitch I don't get tired
Stackin' this paper, you aroused to that dollars
Trip overseas just to broader my horizons
Phone bill is stacked from fuckin' with Verizon
No, I been hot but it's all about the timin'
Drinkin' my tequila with a little splash of lime and
Jet lag, can't even tell you what the time is
Left hand can't see what the right hand doin'
I don't need to brag, let the money bands do it

[Hook: Kreayshawn]
It's not me who's actin' funny
Since I made a little money
Go and get ya grind on
Go and get ya shine on
