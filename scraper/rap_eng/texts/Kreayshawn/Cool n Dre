[Chorus]
The guys out here, they really are crookin'
They snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking
But what can I say? It's the place to be
It's the-

[Kreayshawn]
This is hot, oh, we outside the club
I'm tryna get V-Nasty but she won't hurry up (C'mon)
We need to get in, we got a V.I.P. table
Roach got a bottle of gin, black label
Push and shove now we up in this damn thing
Killed a girl whole game if she give a bad taste
Come on baby, we need to get wavy
And don't run far 'cause I'm not fond of chasing
But anyways, we killed about a whole fifth
Now we smoking in the parking lot tryna keep lit
Met a girl with a brick full of lean
About six of my chicks on the bad girl team
We left soon to see where them girls stay
Up in the hills overlooking the whole Bay
Turn the house out and make it to a party
Invite all the [?] from the block and start swobbin'

[Chorus]
The guys out here, they really are crookin'
They snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking
Snatch, snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking
Snatch, snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking

The guys out here, they really are crookin'
They snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking
Snatch, snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking
Snatch, snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking

Just fill my drink and let me do my dance
Tonight is something special, I'm gonna make it last
Fill my drink and let me do my dance
Tonight is something special, I'm gonna make it last

[V-Nasty]
Just came in the party and I brought my whole crew
Everybody's talking, didn't know what to do
Stuck like glue 'cause we the main attraction
Security at the door so we the only hoes packin'
Ass is clappin', speakers slappin'
If your bitch wanna [?] who we snatchin'?
Girls at my mansion, hop out in the mornin' and we all still gassin'
Kreayshawn pulled up and she bounced out the [?]
You know she ain't reppin' Gucci, Louis or Prada
Life been a party, my name V-Nasty
We all on one, you ain't need to gotta ask me
I get every bitch, not one compassion
Called Britney, Jasmine [?]
I'm feelin' classy in the back of the whip
Couple ice in the syrup and it's fresh out the brick

[Chorus]
The guys out here, they really are crookin'
They snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking
Snatch, snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking
Snatch, snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking

The guys out here, they really are crookin'
They snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking
Snatch, snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking
Snatch, snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking

Just fill my drink and let me do my dance
Tonight is something special, I'm gonna make it last
Fill my drink and let me do my dance
Tonight is something special, I'm gonna make it last

[DB Tha General]
When I been to LA, I'm swagged up, mobbed up
One mornin' in California when the White Girl Mob rocked up
We shut it down, messed around [?]
We don't get nobody [?] over now
Nah, it ain't over, nah, we never sober
Somebody call the cops [?]
We party like the crackhouse, you ain't mobbin' round, you can get the fuck out
Are you hearing me, clearly?
Them bitches all up in my face, security
Are you hearing me, clearly?
Them bitches all in my face, security
I'm turnt up, turnt up, all the way turnt up
[?]
They hatin' on us [?]
East Oakland in the building [?]

[Chorus]
The guys out here, they really are crookin'
They snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking
Snatch, snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking
Snatch, snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking

The guys out here, they really are crookin'
They snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking
Snatch, snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking
Snatch, snatch gold chains when the cops ain't looking

Just fill my drink and let me do my dance
Tonight is something special, I'm gonna make it last
Fill my drink and let me do my dance
Tonight is something special, I'm gonna make it last
