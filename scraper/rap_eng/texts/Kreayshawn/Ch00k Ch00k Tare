Yeah you bitches callin’ me better talk quick
Only pull it out if you smokin’ on that bomb shit
Light it up, pour it up, asapolous
I see you lookin’ hard but you still missin’ this
Knock knock bitch, I’m comin’ down the front door
Girls think they mobbin’ but, they really just boppin’ whores
Close, your legs, open ears and turn up tonight
I got that bomb bomb that’ll have you feelin’ right

[ Chippy Nonstop ]

Give a bitch bone take her ass home

Privet devotchka, do you have a number?
I’m tryna take you to the streets and bump it like its summer
Privet devotchka, you’re sippin’ on your white Russian
I’m sippin’ on my syrup, moving slow but, I’m still rushin’

Killa team, killa squad, killa killa ho
Just when you got it all you always wanna get some more
Big dreams, big bank Free Bigga Bell
I’m with Chippy chip, and we back outta hell

[ Chippy Nonstop ]

Pre-School hit em with the bomb diggy bomb diggy
