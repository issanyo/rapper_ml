[Intro]
God, I just been through so much
I wanna forget
I don't wanna remember any of this bullshit
Fuck all of this
Fuck him
Fuck everything!

[Hook]
I'm boutta pop me a Xan
Forget that he was my man
I'm runnin' as fast as I can
His dick so small in my hand
He didn't even make me cum
I kicked him out, he was a bum
He wanna stay on my couch, boy
Get outta my house, boy

[Verse]
Who are you comin' at me?
Sayin' who I need to be
I never seen nothin' from you
Couldn't you be up in the streets?
You always talk about your raps
But they sound like crap
I'm not gonna click your link, boy
The fuck you think?
Rappin' 'bout bitches you hit
Heard that they didn't want dick
You gotta convince the bitch
She didn't let you in
Now you mad? Talkin' 'bout she lyin'?
I don't giva a fuck what's true
Bitch, this pistol finna start firin'
Boutta pop me a
Boutta pop me a what?
Boutta pop me a
Boutta pop me a what?
But I ain't talkin' shit but I'll pop you, bitch
Rape me and I'll kill you, bitch
Touch my friend, I'll kill you, bitch
I don't give a fuck [?] feeling is

[Hook]
I'm boutta pop me a Xan
Forget that he was my man
I'm runnin' as fast as I can
His dick was so small in my hand
I'm boutta pop me a Xan
Forget that he was my man
I'm runnin' as fast as I can
His dick so small in my hand

[Outro]
(His dick was so small)
He's so small, man
(I wanna forget it all)
I wanna forget it all

I wanna forget it all
(But until then)
