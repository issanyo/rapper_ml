[Intro]
Its the murderer, its the murderer
Its the murderer, its the murderer

[Verse 1: V-Nasty]
Just got some stacks, got the pistol in the backpack
One in my hand, leave a nigga with no get-back
I'm on some solid shit, what you niggas callin' it?]
[?] that you niggas [?] it
You know me and my real niggas show off, we ball off
Late night creepin' in the rental, tinted windows

Got bitches sayin' suspects didn't know, leave no witness though
Bad bitches say', "V-Nasty you a all star!"
I'm kilin' bitches, come back in a new car
They shot up at my whip but it didn't get 'em far
I'm aimin' at bodies, bitch, I don't shoot at cars!

[Verse 2: Kreayshawn]
Come back on the murder game, Kreayshawn has a thang
Well, that's a big thang
[?] really make a bitch sang
We can [?} if you buy a [?]
Got your bitch ride, whole [?} grown out
187 on a ho is what I'm talkin' 'bout

[?] poppin' off the couch
She don't believe what we always talkin' bout
Run out, talk shit get pushed back
White girls got clips like we in Baghdad
We active, a real savage

A murder charge? We ain't havin' it
We [?] the passport
We ain't scared of a bitch, passin' Newports
I smoke it slow man, [?] the bro man
I pull my pistol out, and let the trigger pull man

[Verse 3: V-Nasty]
Woke up in the middle of the night on some freaky shit
Busters callin' me askin' why I'm never speakin [?]
[?] ask me why I knocked them down
Filed a missin' report, but bruh was never found

Had to chop his body up, in the river he drowned
I'm on some psycho shit, kill a bitch [?]
Leave no evidence, no fingerprints
187 homicide coming close to where you sleep at
Yeah these voices ain't let me get my sleep back

3 AM outside in the mornin'
Creepin' through your window while its rainin' pourin'
Got these  keys to my whip and my whip game far
Haters actin' like they adore me, but fake bitches on that type of shit [?] me
Come through the front door, break your whole family
Niggas talkin' shit but you knew you was my enemy
