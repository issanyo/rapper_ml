[Verse 1]
Little shawty blew up
Life of a screw up
Nobody fucking with her
Had to come up
Always fucking with 'em
Had to come down
Always chunking with 'em
Had to go buy yourself by the bus
And you got no change
And you're out of luck
And you gotta go far
And you gotta walk hard
And you gotta get there
And it don't matter where
But-but-but--
You know you gotta come up
Doing hella stuff
Cause you gotta-gotta--
Gotta get going
And you gotta get blown
And you gotta grow up
And you gotta get grown
But life-life--
Life ain't fair
You gotta go everywhere unprepared
Cause nobody know
Where the fucking roll go
Left, right, left, right
I don't know
Hey. What?
Life is changing
Everyone around you is complaining
And they don't know why
But what I'm saying
Gotta be right cause
Hey, that's life man
You know what?
Life is but
This fucking sucks
I'm gonna give up
(C'mon, you're making progress)
(You got this)

[Hook]
Life under construction, baby
You don't got shit
But nothing, baby
Life under construction, baby
You don't get nowhere
Doing nothing, baby
Life under construction, baby
You don't got shit
But nothing, baby
Life under construction, baby
You don't get nowhere
Doing nothing, baby
Life under construction, baby
You don't got shit
But nothing, baby
Life under construction, baby
You don't get nowhere
Doing nothing, baby
Life under construction, baby
You don't got shit
But nothing, baby
Life under construction, baby
You don't get nowhere
Doing nothing, baby

[Verse 2]
Put up the orange cones
We gotta open trench
For the heart of your [?]
Gotta keep that zone real safe-real safe
Got thirty men working up on this place
Slow up, this ain't a race
Cause life take time
When you feel a change
Wanna give up?
Then turn the page
And start a new
And make a strange
Don't follow patterns
Gotta make it happen
Gotta get it cracking
If you want it, get it
Got it?
And you're the captain
But don't crash ship
When you're in traffic
I'm just laughing
Cause life is weird
One second, you're here
Then you're everywhere
Nothing's consistent
Life is a mistress
Cause it's fucking so many bitches
Karma will get your ass too
So don't think you're dodging
When you start all new
What comes 'round must go around
And back around
And up and down
And side to side
I shake my head
Cause I'd rather feel alive
Then almost dead
R-I-P to the old me
Now I'm sailing on the new seas

[Hook]
Life under construction, baby
You don't got shit
But nothing, baby
Life under construction, baby
You don't get nowhere
Doing nothing, baby
Life under construction, baby
You don't got shit
But nothing, baby
Life under construction, baby
You don't get nowhere
Doing nothing, baby
Life under construction, baby
You don't got shit
But nothing, baby
Life under construction, baby
You don't get nowhere
Doing nothing, baby
Life under construction, baby
You don't got shit
But nothing, baby
Life under construction, baby
You don't get nowhere
Doing nothing, baby
