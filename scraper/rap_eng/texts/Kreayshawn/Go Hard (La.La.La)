[Intro: Lil Debbie]
Hey, bitch!
What's up?
You know I'd really like to do that
But I don't have any fucking money
Like, I don't have any fucking money

[Hook: Kreayshawn]
Hey, bitch, do you really, really, really wanna go hard?
Go in the crib, steal your stepfather's credit card
And take the car do circles in the parking lot
Scream at the top of our lungs like la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
We on that la la la la la la la la la la

[Verse 1: Kreayshawn]
Hey, bitch! I see you working at the mall
At Forever 21, selling tanks and shawls
You wanna quit your job? You need a place to go?
Girl, run your own show but don't be on some ho shit
Bounce with something cute on
I kiss into a fog zone
I be really off
And searching for some water though
What it do, let it go and go hard
Let me see you do it, go hard, like real hard

[Hook: Kreayshawn]
Hey, bitch, do you really, really, really wanna go hard?
Go in the crib, steal your stepfather's credit card
And take the car do circles in the parking lot
Scream at the top of our lungs like la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
We on that la la la la la la la la la la

[Verse 2: Kreayshawn]
Girl, you need that new
Bottles on chill, I got gold chain flu
Little lady on my side, show me how you ride out
Be a good one and I'll take you to my hideout
Pretty little bitch dripping like some water though
I be on that straw and coming for that lo-lo
What I did, let her go, she's back now
She went real hard until she threw her back out

[Hook: Kreayshawn]
Hey, bitch, do you really, really, really wanna go hard?
Go in the crib, steal your stepfather's credit card
And take the car do circles in the parking lot
Scream at the top of our lungs like la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
We on that la la la la la la la la la la

[Kreayshawn]
Silly girl, take your jacket off!
Get off the floor
Go hard, go hard
G-go hard, go hard, go hard
Damn
Do do do do do it like, do it like, do it like
Let me see you go hard, go hard, go hard
G-go hard, go hard

[Hook: Kreayshawn]
Hey, bitch, do you really, really, really wanna go hard?
Go in the crib, steal your stepfather's credit card
And take the car do circles in the parking lot
Scream at the top of our lungs like la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
We on that la la la la la la la la la la
