[Verse 1: Kreayshawn]
I'm hot (x3)
I'm so hot
I'm on fire
Got these hoes like a fireman
They up and down the pole again, we smokin' on the dro again
Don't want no fuckin' ice man, cause I'm meltin' it
I'm hotter than the lava, yeah you gotta smoke a cigarette
Before you get with it
I'm the fuckin' heater
You know you wanna eat her
That spicy se√±orita
No Gucci, no Louis, no Prada
But still I see you wanna
You can keep me as your daughter

[Hook: Kreayshawn]
What's that? What's up?
Someone call that fire truck
My drank, my cup, is fillin' and I can't catch up
My back, my butt
I'm movin' and I'm shakin' it
I got all these chickens clucking
Foxy's in the coop
I'm takin' it
I'm hot (x4)

[Verse 2: Kreayshawn
I'm sippin' and spittin' on 'em
The bo got me gettin' on 'em
They trippin', I'm shittin' on 'em
Kreayshawn B on I'm poppin' off
From the chop on my block
To the thighs on my street
Got her lickin' her teeth
Her boyfriend's grabbin' this heat man
These clubs hella lame, yo
These rappers are trash, man
The games fuckin' gonejo, man
I'm bringin' it back
Fuckin' chasin' your whip
Leave your wife 'n some shit
And I'm gonna get thunder
They ain't pulling me under

[Hook: Kreayshawn]

[Verse 3: Hollywood Holt]
Ha, Hollywood!
Somebody call the firetruck
I'm lighting live like wire struck
Carpets and apartments
Don't get started cause I'm live as fuck
I've started an arsenal on these whack rappers
That's why they suck
Set flame to those lame ho niggas that stir the grease
So do not try your luck
I'm H-O double L, Y, nigga
Don't be mad cause I'm fly, nigga
See through you hoes like fishnet
So you better dipset or you might die, nigga
Shy guy that's why I try in my life
Sellin' records, showin' that I'm bigger
I will get to kickin' your bitch ass
Quick fast, like whip lash
If you fuck with my niggas
That's dro and biz
I drinks, I blaze
Kreayshawn she wiz, mad hard, and steeze
