Babycakes, you just don't know

Babycakes, you just don't know
How I, how I like it down low
And I just wanted you to know that I think our love will grow
We'll take it step by step because I'm not something you own. x2

The love that here you left me lonely
But now that you're here you're right next to me
So see, I can see you carefully
When you look to me it's just like a dream
Make me scream, hearing your voice so talk to me
When I can't hear your love can you speak it up
When we going too slow can you speed it up

I just want you to know that I think our love will grow x4

Babycakes, you just don't know
How I, how I like it down low
And I just wanted you to know that I think our love will grow
We'll take it step by step because I'm not something you own

I don't wanna feel this way
It's just hurts to say your name
Log on and see your face, it's so cute it's not the same
Light up a blunt and pass it up
My favourite food, won't give it up
Not thinking about what I wanna do, only thinking about you
That boy he loves me so
Holds me tight, he can't let go
At school he holds my books, he gives me love, he is no crook
Say I hope you feel the same
Don't know which one to blame
This way I feel can not be fake, because you're my babycakes

Babycakes, you just don't know
How I, how I like it down low
And I just wanted you to know that I think our love will grow
We'll take it step by step because I'm not something you own. x2

I just want you to know that I think our love will grow x4

I think our love will grow
