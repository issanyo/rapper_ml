Four blunts, four bottles of gin
Four bitches, I need more bitches!
Four bitches, I need more bitches!
Four bitches, I need more bitches!
Four blunts, four bottles of gin
Four bitches, I need more bitches!
Four bitches, I need more bitches!
Four bitches, I need more bitches!

[Verse 1: V-Nasty]
Four blunts, four bottles of gin
One bitch, four of her friends
I think this where my party begins
Girl, I wish this moment will never end
Got a bitch but I need some mo'
Four bitches equal forty toes
They all down, hoe-in' is all they know
Gotta make a stack just to get out the cold
Bitch its me, Mrs. V
Why you outta town?
O for the city
If you wanna see life, baby fuck with me
I'm the lady of the shit, yes I'm the queen
Wanna get high so I smoke a whole zip
Keep rolling up chops, loading up crisp
Four ounces of bo gotta give it a kiss
Off purple weed and gin bitch I'm lit

[Verse 2: Kreayshawn]
Hey, bitch!
Need bitches? Man I gotta room full
You think Kreayshawn ain't pimpin, you a damn fool
I'm gassin', my money be the fuel
All these bitches gettin' wet, but I can't swim in a pool
I'm just drownin' in a 40 though
Need it like a Chinese on this 40, yo
Not in Japan but my eyes hella closed
Got my swisher turned up on my thrift clothes
And I'm getting lazy money, that's free dough
Got these bitches lookin crisp like a Frito
I'm just me though, who else should I be?
Young Kreayshawn, man, you need to feel this heat though
Score on a bitch like I'm throwing free throws
Money, bitches, weed, and bo is what I get the most
So put your cups in the air, get ready for the toast
The score is more to keep than four hoes

[Verse 3: Roach Gigz]
Yeah, it's RG, doper than Hardy
I get started like car keys
My barbie in the bed with dark trees
But over here? It's all clear
I want Boston, that Paul Pierce
All ears? Better listen up
One thing I don't? Give a fuck
You could die down, imma live it up
And I still go dumb, fuck your wisdom, bruh
It's R-Geezy, I could steal your car easy
Life's a game, it's parcheesy
Hopped out the car, now I'm on the bar, Wheezy
The pigs was chasing but I'm faster man
But the bacon cain't fuck with my master plan
You half a man, you a belly button
Breath full of gin, smell it cousin?
