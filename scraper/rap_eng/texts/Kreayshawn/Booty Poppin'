[Intro]
'Hey Kreayshawn
I was at this party
And I made a new dance
Here I'll show you!'
'Oh damn girl! OOOh shit girl!!!
OOOOOOOOOh damn
I think you made that booty pop'

[Verse 1]
Booty poppin' on the floor
Don't be shy better be her score
On the ground or on the table
Stand up make that booty stable
Like milian and dip it low
Quicky Quicky girl
While you on the pole
You ain't no ho
Girl we know
We just wanna see that bootyhole

Look at that booty like the world so round
Like ra-ra take it to the ground
Don't play dumb or will take you to the town
Where bops like you, they get turned out
So come on girl we ain't no cops
We just wanna see that booty pop
So strip girl like it's hella- tonna- hot!!!
In the kitchen shakin' while we cooking in the pot
Aye lil mama
You so bad
You don't pop
And it makes me sad
So come on girl and make me glad
I'll throw you out
Like a trash bag
Or like a bitch who's booty sag
And aaahhh yeeaa
Just tryna see that
That booty pop
That booty pop
Hey
