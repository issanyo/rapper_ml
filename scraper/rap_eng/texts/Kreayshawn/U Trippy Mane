[Intro]
Get up, bitch, get up, bitch, get up, bitch, get up
(We trippy mane)
Get up, bitch, get up, bitch, get up, bitch, get up
(Juicy J)
Get up, bitch, get up, bitch, get up, bitch, get up

Get up, bitch, get up, bitch, get up, bitch, get up
(You know it)

[Hook: Juicy J & Kreayshawn]
You trippy man?(She trippy mane)
I’m trippy mane (We trippy mane)
You trippy mane? (She trippy mane)
I’m trippy mane? (We trippy mane)
I’m smoking Cali kush, pour up the drank (Heyy)
With a lot of bad bitches, get trippy mane

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Juicy J and Kreayshawn, that's a smoking marathon
I take a shot, I take a shot, that's a drinking marathon
Double cup of that kickstand, all I know is big bands
Juicy J got bitches, fuck with my pimpin'
Pinky ring on my pimp hand with the lean is how a pimp stand
Oh I sound like Snoop Dogg, coupe de ville with two broads
Sippin' on that Texas Tea, niggas call me Boss Hog
(Trippy) At your local college, baggy full of adderall
(So trippy) With a strap on me, fuck the gun law
(Too trippy) If you blow my high then I'm going off
Trippy, trippy, trippy, I don't think you get it mane
I walk around the club smellin' like a Sinex mane

[Hook: Juicy J & Kreayshawn]
You trippy man?
She trippy mane
I'm trippy mane
We trippy mane
You trippy mane?
She trippy mane
I'm trippy mane
We trippy mane
I'm smoking Cali kush, pour up the drank
Heyy
With a lot of bad bitches, get trippy mane

[Verse 2: Kreayshawn]
(Duh... haaa)
He a trip, I'm a trip, but no fallin' out
We back-pourin syrup all up on the trap couch
Purple body shots on that bitch, I let it drip
Rolled her head back, now she's saying she can't handle it
That's KREAY, she hid a trippy stick out her ass
Juicy J sat me down and taught me well in trippy class
I got so much trip, I fell asleep high, I woke up high
If I'm sober, I lie!
That's some downers man, they really got my mind singin'
If I was a car I'd be purple wood grain swingin'(Ayee)
Leanin' never beanin', felonies and misdemeanors
So trippy mane, you can call me Juicy Gina!

[Hook: Juicy J & Kreayshawn]
You trippy man?
She trippy mane
I'm trippy mane
We trippy mane
You trippy mane?
She trippy mane
I'm trippy mane
We trippy mane
I'm smoking Cali kush, pour up the drank
Heyy
With a lot of bad bitches, get trippy mane
