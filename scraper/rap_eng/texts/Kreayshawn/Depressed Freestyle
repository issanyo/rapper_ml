[Intro]
I don't know what's wrong
Its like
I'm sad
But I'm not crying
I'm just hot
Uh
You got me hot
Y'all got me hot
You got me hot
I'm just hot man
Hot
I'm so

[Verse 1]
Really got me hot today
If it ain't about guap don't talk to me
I think I'm depressed, yah fucking probably
Fucking doing shit wrong not properly
Not eating healthy man fucking broccoli
Feel like I did my own fucking robbery
On my sanity
Because I'm mad at me
And I can't figure out why I'm feeling like shit
People telling me get up you a lazy bitch
But gimme a break
Cause I must admit
My brain not working right man I'm out of it
And everything you fucking say go me mad as hell
Telling me to mediate, go eat some kale
But yoga ain't shit
Man I don't wanna talk about it
Drink a beer and sit around and just feel like shit

[Bridge]
You should try reading The Secret (Got me hot, got me hot)
Maybe go for a walk (Got me hot, got me hot)
You know mediation always helps (Got me hot, got me hot)
Uh

[Verse 2]
Man don't tell me how to deal
You don't know who I am, you don't know how I feel
Your feelings ain't my feelings and you ain't in my head
Don't give me no advice I'm not needing it
I don't want your fucking book I'm not reading it
And if I hear one more time I need exercise
I'm gonna come over there and Imma clap on your mind bitch
I'm not doing shit
I'm not listening
I don't wanna go to the gym
Fuck this, fuck everything
Fuck that bae
I'm not doing shit
Imma sit here today
Think this song is fucking whack and I'm not gonna play it
For none of my friends 'cause they don't care
They don't like my fucking shit
They don't play it nowhere
Don't listen to me cause I ain't shit to you
Man I don't give a fuck 'cause Imma bounce back soon

[Outro]
You should try reading The Secret and
Maybe you should go for a walk, take some deep breathes
You know meditation always helps
