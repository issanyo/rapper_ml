[Verse 1: Roach Gigz]
They said put him on the fridge he a pussy magnet
Why you talk about pussy? Cuz I love to smash it
I love big titties and I love asses
But when cash involved I gotta pass it
They said put him on the fridge he a pussy magnet
Why you talk about pussy? Cuz I love to smash it
I love big titties and I love asses
But when cash involved I gotta pass it
Five in the morning in the town car
Airport bound cuz the bands call
Feel like a 49 I fuckin dig it
Tryin to get my stacks lookin like midgets
Do it over and over like a bad picture
I just wanna eat, like fat bitches
No feelings involved that’s bad business
I’ma tap bitches
If I leave the house I give my son kisses

[Hook: Kreayshawn]
They said put him on the fridge he a pussy magnet
Put him on the fridge he a pussy magnet
They said put him on the fridge he a pussy magnet
Why you talk about pussy?
Cuz I love to smash it
But when it come to cash I gotta have it
When it come to cash I gotta have it
When it come to cash I gotta have it
It’s the city of gold and I’m a addict

[Verse 2: Roach Gigz]
I got one problemo
I need my money long as a limo
Don’t let this pit out the kennel
I’m a man but I won't be gentle
We don’t play possum I’m a boss
It ain't nothing to it
Broke the peace and I'm lovin to
Ain't never met a boss who said it wasn't cool
Believe it I got a A bitch a B bitch
A C bitch with cleavage that don’t keep no secrets
A D bitch that return my red box on time
And swear that Moscato the best kind of wine
But fuck all the bitches don’t call me no more
The city of gold has banned all you whores
I need to eat and I need to eat now
Cuz I am a bear and I rep it like Cal

They said put him on the fridge he a pussy magnet
Put him on the fridge he a pussy magnet
They said put him on the fridge he a pussy magnet
Why you talk about pussy?
Cuz I love to smash it
But when it come to cash I gotta have it
When it come to cash I gotta have it
When it come to cash I gotta have it
It’s the city of gold and I’m a addict
