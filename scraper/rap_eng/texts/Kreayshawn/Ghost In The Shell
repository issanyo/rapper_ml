If you smoke then light it up and if you sip then pour it up
I got money on mind and I can't seem to get enough [x2]

I'm spirited away, baby won't you come and wish me well
Took a cup of quarters and I dropped them down a wishing well
Well, I'm faded like a ghost in the shell
If you wanna get to heaven first you gotta walk through hell
Yeah, I seen it all before, bitches get back hit the floor
Expect my nights and city lights, I'm dreaming about something more
The more you win, the more you hate, swisheer stuff win purple grapes
40 racks up in my bag, say I'm plotting my escape

If you smoke then light it up and if you sip then pour it up
I got money on mind and I can't seem to get enough [x2]

La, la, la like ghost in the shell (x4)

In the Bay they say that Kreayshawn's a rockin' rolla
Tatted like a chola, little loca's never sober
Colder than an eskimo, gassin'like I'm textico
I'm quick to pull the burner out and pistol whip a reckless hoe
Slow your role and speed it up, hit rewind and beat it up
I'm sippin' from the bottle straight, bitch I don't even need a cup
Make it rain and let it pour, blow some cash and make some more
Your wifey wanna cup me up, but I don't even love that whore

If you smoke then light it up and if you sip then pour it up
I got money on mind and I can't seem to get enough [x2]

La, la, la like ghost in the shell (x4)

Slow your role and speed it up, hit rewind and beat it up
I'm sippin' from the bottle straight, bitch I don't even need a cup
