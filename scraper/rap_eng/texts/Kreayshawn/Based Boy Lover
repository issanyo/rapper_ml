I'm so wavy
Oh, you're my based boy lover, you know that?

You're my based boy lover, we're higher than the others
We don't fuck with them lames and we dodging all you suckers
But see, boy you different, you ain't like all these bitches
Conversation proper and you always stay for dinner
Rollin' us some swishers, let's smoke an Oreo
Lay back and relax and tell me your story, yo
Kick up my feet on the couch and pass out
Smoked a quarter and we nearly set fire to your house

Now we sitting here high and I'm lost in your eyes
Or maybe yours and mines?
You're my based boy love, it's so sexy
Late night calls all day when you text me

You're my based boy lover
You're my based boy lover
You're my based boy lover
You're my based boy lover

Oh, my based boy lover, you bring me all these snacks and candies
Oh, my based boy lover, you tickle my fanny (Oh, based boy, you're so silly)
Oh, my based boy lover, he got the best trees
And if I got none then he gives me what I need

Now we sitting here high and I'm lost in your eyes
Or maybe yours and mines?
You're my based boy love, it's so sexy
Late night calls all day when you text me

You're my based boy lover
You're my based boy lover
You're my based boy lover
You're my based boy lover

Yeah, y'know Dame Grease is on this beat, y'know, so I'm feeling really wavy, y'know?
Tryna make some based babies man!
But y'know I really think I love you, you're like, my based boy fantasy
My thug passion

You're my based boy lover
You're my based boy lover
You're my based boy lover
You're my based boy lover
