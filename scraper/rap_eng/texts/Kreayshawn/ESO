[Verse 1: Bobby Brackins]
Yeah, taking it day by day's what a young nigga do
Keepin' it lit, putting on for the crew
Shades in the beam, yelling out, "what it do?"
Mobbin' round town whip got no roof, have you seen it?
Think the fucking top's gone missin'
They say I"m hard headed, bruh, I don't wanna listen
2 Chainz say bitch I'm different
Mad black drop top, bitch I'm whippin'
Feelin' good, always sippin' on Rozay
Doin' it big, looking out for the homies
All the girls stay jockin' men, and these bitch ass niggas ain't stoppin' it!

[Hook: Bobby Brackins]
We go in, that's all I know
All I know, that's the only thing that I know
Go hard for the ESO, the ESO, go hard for the ESO
We go in, that's all I know
All I know, that's the only thing that I know
Go hard for the ESO, the ESO, go hard for the ESO

[Verse 2: Kreayshawn]
The East ain't home for the weak
My lights shine brighter from the dark in these streets
But I'm so nice cause my swisher's so sweet
Here's a chair for them hatin' ass bitches, needa take a seat!
I mean, I pull off in the candy paint
Doin' up a damn thang like my doodoo don't stank
I'm gone, blowin' up in a cloud of smoke
Pick it up, drop it off like I'm doing my show
Bitches actin' like they know but they don't know
Bitches actin like they don't but they do ho
Pretty bitches wanna kick it like Judo
Mobbin' round town, pockets fat like a sumo!

[Hook: Bobby Brackins]
We go in, that's all I know
All I know, that's the only thing that I know
Go hard for the ESO, the ESO, go hard for the ESO
We go in, that's all I know
All I know, that's the only thing that I know
Go hard for the ESO, the ESO, go hard for the ESO

[Verse 3: D-Lo]
Aye, what's happenin'? Bobby what's happenin'?
Look, D-Lo, look, look
Man I'm hotter than Saracha, all this gold on my neck I'm like Versace, Versace!
You can't rob me
Pussy niggas don't fear me (Nope)
Wiretapped niggas get blood in they erpiece (Blaaaapt)
I got a tribe, but killing's no conquest
Beat a nigga up on the street, I'm ?
I been runnin' through the Bay reckless
I'm Frank Gore
Made it out the hood, no more postin' at liquor stores
My city is getting crazy
Home invasions on Asians
I'm pimpin', on nothing but Caucasians
East Oakland, the land of the homicide
Where we bounce out nigga we don't drive by! [Wha?]

[Hook: Bobby Brackins]
We go in, that's all I know
All I know, that's the only thing that I know
Go hard for the ESO, the ESO, go hard for the ESO
We go in, that's all I know
All I know, that's the only thing that I know
Go hard for the ESO, the ESO, go hard for the ESO

Hey! Kreayshawn
East Oakland
