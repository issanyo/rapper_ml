The club go ratchet, ratchet
Ratchet, ratchet

Get the fuck out of my area
Shake my hair like very a
Loreal, wallet thicker than Adele
Meet my people from the internet
I go hard like delicate
Millionaires, throw one hundreds in the air
Riding shotgun with Amanda Bynes
So fucked up, yeah I made her drive
Riding shotgun with Amanda Bynes
Bitch, I’m not try’na get a DUI

Pop-pop another one
Pop-pop another one
Pop-pop another one
Pop-pop another one

Do you want it like this
I can move it like that
If you want it like this
I can do it all night
If you want it like this
We can do it like that
We can do it all night

The club go ratchet, ratchet
Ratchet, ratchet
Ratchet, ratchet
R…r…r…
The club go ratchet, ratchet
Ratchet, ratchet
Ratchet, ratchet

Yeah I’ll let you stare
Playing with myself like solitaire
Kissing on your boy like you isn’t there
So dirty, Christina Aguilere, ah
Now I’m on the move
Cruisin’ to the club on my 22s
Fake ID, I’m never caught
Smokin’ shit until I cough
Take my shirt and rip it up
Lick it up like err’y drop

Pop-pop another one
Pop-pop another one
Pop-pop another one
Pop-pop another one

Do you want it like this
I can move it like that
If you want it like this
I can do it all night
If you want it like this
We can do it like that
We can do it all night

The club go ratchet, ratchet

But if we got to we taking off smooth as Nair
