[Intro]
Rocky Luciano

[Chorus: Rocky Luciano]
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Or should I walk by a second time?
Camo cargos bathing eights bitch I'm fly
You're the kind of girl I want in my life, in my life, in my life
You're the kind of girl I want in my life, in my life, in my life
You're the kind of girl I want in my life

[Verse 1: Rocky Luciano]
I love the way you roll it while you drivin
Smokin' on cruise control like a pilot
You make me blush Its hard to hide it
All caught up still trine find it
This loves a high but shit I just wanna ride it
All caught up still trine find it
You make me nervous, its hard to hide it
But I get lost staring off in your eyes
I'll do anything to be by your side
2017 Bonnie and Clyde
Nicki and Matt [?] you my ride or die
Late night on the beach getting shells
Drunk in love talking about getting wedding bails
First time I fell in love with yo smile
Its the most beautiful thing that I've seen in a while
I wanna marry you and raise a child
Crazy how love yeah it makes me wild
I enjoy appearance and I love your style

[Chorus: Rocky Luciano]
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Or should I walk by a second time?
Camo cargos bathing eights bitch I'm fly
You're the kind of girl I want in my life, in my life, in my life
You're the kind of girl I want in my life, in my life, in my life
You're the kind of girl I want in my life

[Verse 2: Kreashawn]
2am and I'm calling your name
Couldn't find you everybody's looking the same
FaceTime you and there's no way to call
Battery running low and I'm charging on the wall
But its getting late and my sets about to end
Tryna take you home and throw you in the bed
Then throw you back out, you can sleep on the couch
Plus I throw it on the field and you really knock it out
'Cause nice boys bad boys man you're all alike
You're only good about just for one night
You're only good for some weed and [?] lite
Then I close the door when you creep out of sight

[Chorus: Rocky Luciano & Kreashawn]
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Or should I walk by a second time?
Camo cargos bathing eights bitch I'm fly
You're the kind of girl I want in my life, in my life, in my life
You're the kind of girl I want in my life, in my life, in my life
You're the kind of girl I want in my life
