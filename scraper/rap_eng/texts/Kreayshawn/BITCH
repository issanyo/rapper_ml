[Verse 1: Kossisko]
She got a nigga in her teeth (Oh, yeah)
She got a nigga losing sleep (Oh, yeah)
She don't wait in lines (Oh, yeah)
But she'll do all your lines (Oh, yeah)

[Chorus: Kossisko]
This is the calm
Before you get the bitch
Before you get the bitch
Before you get the storm
This is the calm
Before you get the bitch
Before you get the bitch
Before you get the horns

[Post-Chorus: Kossisko]
She don't dance
She wanna get high
I stared into her eyes
Those pretty blank eyes
Get high
I stared into her eyes
Knew she was dead inside
Like I am dead inside

[Interlude]
Oh shit, Kossi, don't stop that shit, please

[Verse 2: Kossisko]
She fuckin' with my health (Oh, yeah)
Make a nigga wanna cut himself (Oh, yeah)
She don't give a fuck about no brands (Oh, yeah)
She don't give a fuck about no bands (Oh, yeah)

[Chorus: Kossisko]
This is the calm
Before you get the bitch
Before you get the bitch
Before you get the storm
This is the calm
Before you get the bitch
Before you get the bitch
Before you get the horns

[Verse 3: Kossisko]
I don't give a fuck if you shaven
That's her body, she do what she wanna
I don't give a fuck if you taken
She don't give a fuck what I'm makin'
She don't need me, I don't need her
No, she don't need me to please her
She don't give a fuck if I'm leavin'
She don't get mad, she get even

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4: Kreayshawn]
Y'all made me the worst of me
Expectin' the best of me
Don't owe you shit, you see
Bringin' nothin' but misery
Talkin' 'bout I need to heal myself
Go ahead and go kill yourself
Apologies ain't shit to me
On one knee, submit to me
Submit to me
