[Verse 1:Young Hawaii Slim]
Young Hawaii Slim
Step through the do'
Lit up a swish
And yes I sco'
On the dance flo'
Dancing and moving
Bobbing with something cute
And if you hate, please do it
Movin', manuverin' like a quarter back
Tryna live laugh if its expensive, I'mma order that
Across the border strapped
Nahh, Smokin fat
With my Russian
Compadre
Y.H. iss got all his game from his madre
Like its birthday or Christmas time
Im tryna trap the stack, to see one hundred g's even if its from quarters nicks and dimes nigga in the nick of time
I'll be gettin it all
Money sure doesnt sleep neither does this song
I'm loaded with kreayshawn and the ruski kush master smokin on the top floor on this dutch master

[Verse 2: Kreayshawn]
Step in the party in the weekend on the ay
All the chickens holla, man they tryna get laid
But me im gettin paidd in miami shadeee
Snuggly til I fade
Man im livin greatt
You might see me poppin up so get familiar
Young kreayshawn knockin at yaa door you better answer
I'm spreading like cancer and I'm swoopin on ya chick
And now she's on me like a fly on shit
But I dont give a shit
I'm walkin with my main bitch
And she roll a blunt quick
Lookin like a chopstick
And im just high
Like every single time
Slidin through with the kush
Smokin out some guy
And now im always on time
My swag is never late
I know these girls hate
But I blow them hoes out like candles on my birthday cake
Never been a barbie man ive never been fake
Somethin like a zommpire
Comin' through with 25 lighters
Ive always been on fire maayne, and really hot
Man im kreayshawn im crazyy I dont stop
