[Verse 1: Kreayshawn]
Hey boy you go, I just want your soul
Wanna go crazy til we end up in a hospital
I think it might be possible
We can get it crackin tho
Constantly togethor and we gettin hella active tho
I think its raw, got mad style
Think i wanna go and kick it for a while
We can do almost everything
Catch a boat, go smoking
Im hoping that this shit ain't gay
So we can really make it something some day
Your face is attractive, personality smackin
Every mental beat you make me slap it
So lets make it happen because i like you
And i really want you to like me too
So put me in a pool and i can swim
But put me in your heart and i won't be jokin
Put me in a blunt and I'll start smokin
Kiss me here, kiss me there
Grab me tight, pull my hair
Because its only for you, i swear

[Chorus: Kreayshawn]
Hey hey hey
Hey boyyy you go
Yah boy you go
And i just wanna let you know that (what)
You go, yah you go
Yah boy, yah boy you go

[Verse 2: Kreayshawn]
Hey girl thats rite go like astronaut
Just wanna cuddle, and be with you all night
Hold you up, real real tight
And hope that we dont get in a fight
So if you like me, i like you truly
And if I spend the night then i won't touch your booty
I respect you and all your wishes
And if you cook dinner then I'll do the dishes
We'll go to, sleep hella early
And if you get lucky I'll lick your pearly
Perr perr perr pearly
Pow pow pow pow
