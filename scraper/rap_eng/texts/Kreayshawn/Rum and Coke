(Verse 1: Kreayshawn)

Vi â€“ vi- vicodin, Rum & Coke;
Magic pills in my coat
Purple weed, purple smoke
Pink champagne, down my throat
I'm feeling like a star but
I'm higher than a comet
When I'm at the dance floor
All the hoochies want it cuzzz

(Hook: Kreayshawn)

I'm snatching bitches and your hoes, -oes, ohh
I'm at the bar I'm blowing dope, -ope, ohh
The blunt I'm smoking's burnin' slow, -ow, ohh
This MDA will make you float, -oat, ohh (x2)

(Verse 2: Dame Grease)

A little bit of weed and Percocet
I don't hide cuz we so wet
Pushing henny make me dizzy
Now I'm in the club on (?)
I can't get it on the floor
If you need I'll get you more
That your chick? She do it all
She's all alone
She's bouncing balls

(Hook: Kreayshawn)

I'm snatching bitches and your hoes, -oes, ohh
I'm at the bar I'm blowing dope, -ope, ohh
The blunt I'm smoking's burnin' slow, -ow, ohh
This MDA will make you float, -oat, ohh (x2)

(Verse 3: Vocaine)

Green eyes, got sassy thighs
Blue eyes got me hypnotize
Brown eyes, got cherry pie
Red eyes, got me really flying high

She drinks patron and rum & coke, -oke
She puts it down and up her nose, -ose
She gets so fucked up that I know, -ow
She's feeling good, she's good to go, -oh. (x2)

(Hook: Kreayshawn)

I'm snatching bitches and your hoes, -oes, ohh
I'm at the bar I'm blowing dope, -ope, ohh
The blunt I'm smoking's burnin' slow, -ow, ohh
This MDA will make you float, -oat, ohh (x2)
