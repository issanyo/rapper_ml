Kreayshawn tote that chopper with the kitty so tight
With the kitty so tight, with the kitty so tight (2x)

(Verse 1: Kreyshawn)
Yeah, my fuckin' mind exploded, grab the 40 Cal. and reload it
Bitch didn't know where she was going man, I grab it like I stole it
Shotgun blasts everywhere, ecstasy, cocaine and burnt hair
Ganging on that bitch like Fred Astaire
Tamed girl shorty, yes I party so naughty
Grab your phone and call me, your shit, I'm ignoring
In the club I'm pouring hennessy
Remy melody, thats my remedy
I'm the man, I'm the bitch

(Hook 2)
Kreayshawn tote that chopper with the kitty so tight
With the kitty so tight, with the kitty so tight (2x)
Pimpin' hoes like Dolomite (6x)

(Verse 2: Kreayshawn)
The swagged little cat will knock you down and put you in a bag
Money bags, Hello Kitty, East Oakland be my city
Mustang straight thang, pink like a panther
Hoes on my dick now, I'm too legit to quit now
Wavy like "Ow", smoking on that loud
Check my Youtube views, they're tens of thou, wow (2x)

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Kreayshawn)
In the G6, cop a .22
I'll put a few holes in you
He was only 22 when he went missing
Caught your partner slipping
Now he hanging off the dock with the fishes
And his whole family miss him, but I'm mobbing
Cranked out with the .22 and I'm robbing (2x)
