Hey!! You wanna be my best friend?
I’m always lookin’ for new friends!
Hey, we can be bestest friends
We don’t even have to pretend
I know you have my back through everything
Yeah, you know Im gonna have yours too
Even if its just me and you
Without the crew together we’re still mobbin’

Cause I really wanna be your friend and we don't even have to hold hands
We can just hang out and do whatever
You like, yeah
We can even go to the movies, ride around
And smoke a couple of doobies
Or we can just hang out and do whatever you like
Yeah! Yeah! YEah!

Hey, remember those notes we passed?
I kept 'em in a crystal glass
So everytime I need a memory, I look back
All those special times, no one can take them
And if I met someone else we can never remake them

'Cause I really wanna be your friend and we don't even have to hold hands
We can just hang out and do whatever
You like, yeah
We can even go to the movies, ride around
And smoke a couple of doobies
Or we can just hang out and do whatever you like

Yeah, I think your parents hate me
But you're still my best friend baby
I-I-I'ma bad girl, and you like that
And you know that I can't hide that
All those letters that we've passed, kept 'em in a crystal glass
I can always look back to the past
And remember those times that we had
All I want is a trill one
All I want is a trill one

'Cause I really wanna be your friend and we don't even have to hold hands
We can just hang out and do whatever
You like, yeah
We can even go to the movies, ride around
And smoke a couple of doobies
Or we can just hang out and do whatever you like
