[Intro]
Love always the way to hate that's a fact though

[Hook]
She was on me from the start, she like the way my chain glow
Ask me what's my name, she was actin' like she ain't know
I told her it was Troy, we hopped in my toy
I'm fuckin' with these bitches, she fuckin' with the boy
She a good girl gone bad, she a good girl gone bad
She a good girl gone bad, she a good girl gone bad
And you know when she gone that she gone forever

[Verse 1]
Lil chick, she on my dick
She ain't low, she ain't slick
We took a pic
Then she like yo who you wit? We bout to split
I'm tryna go get the whip, I'm ridin' rich
She like "oh"
She ain't never ever-ever rolled in Bentley
She ain't never ever-ever hold the Beretta
Countin' cheddar, pussy wetter, doin' setups
Goin' a whole different way from when I first met her

[Hook]
She was on me from the start, she like the way my chain glow
Ask me what's my name, she was actin' like she ain't know
I told her it was Troy, we hopped in my toy
I'm fuckin' with these bitches, she fuckin' with the boy
She a good girl gone bad, she a good girl gone bad
She a good girl gone bad, she a good girl gone bad
And you know when she gone that she gone forever

[Verse 2]
Time pass, we joke and laugh
Puffin' cash with the feds, countin' case, this might last
But the Mac (?) the mask (?)
But this bitch kiss her in her mouth, grab her ass
We gon' shop to help the mold
She gettin' older, don't stop, I'm gettin' guap
She get the blow, cops came, she held it down, it's tip toe
More realer than Joey Bad, he a sucker you feel?

[Hook]
She was on me from the start, she like the way my chain glow
Ask me what's my name, she was actin' like she ain't know
I told her it was Troy, we hopped in my toy
I'm fuckin' with these bitches, she fuckin' with the boy
She a good girl gone bad, she a good girl gone bad
She a good girl gone bad, she a good girl gone bad
And you know when she gone that she gone forever

[Verse 3]
I'm out of town, making rounds with the pounds
Hearin' sounds by a couple clowns ridin' round
Checkin' in, baby what you mean? (?)
Switch the V holdin' down the seat, it's goin' down
Gonna smoke, (?) chokes
I'm goin' wild, where they at?
Head taps, I did em' foul
I break down, ridin' the Audi
Now she gone even though they (?) for ever more

[Hook]
She was on me from the start, she like the way my chain glow
Ask me what's my name, she was actin' like she ain't know
I told her it was Troy, we hopped in my toy
I'm fuckin' with these bitches, she fuckin' with the boy
She a good girl gone bad, she a good girl gone bad
She a good girl gone bad, she a good girl gone bad
And you know when she gone that she gone forever

[Bridge]
Ever, ever
Ever, ever
Ever, ever
Ever, ever
Ever, ever
Ever, ever
Ever, ever
Ever, ever
And you know when she gone that she gone forever

[Hook]
She was on me from the start, she like the way my chain glow
Ask me what's my name, she was actin' like she ain't know
I told her it was Troy, we hopped in my toy
I'm fuckin' with these bitches, she fuckin' with the boy
She a good girl gone bad, she a good girl gone bad
She a good girl gone bad, she a good girl gone bad
And you know when she gone that she gone forever

[Outro]
Good girl, good girl, good girl
Good girl, good girl, good girl
Good girl, good girl, good girl
Good girl, good girl, good girl
