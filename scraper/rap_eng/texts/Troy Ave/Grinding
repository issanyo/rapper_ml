[Hook]
Winding like a motherfucker
Swear I feel on top of the world
Shining like a motherfucker Â 
We over here chilling, chilling
Grinding like a motherfucker
I swear I be all over the world
It's my timing like a motherfucker
We focused on winning

[Verse 1: Paypa]
City after city, signing big ol' titties
Flyer than a Commodore, pockets Lionel Richie
These bad bitches is all in my face, they think I'm illy
Giving me they faith, and I tell 'em it's no biggie
Bad motherfucker, ball like I'm at Rucker
Out here for my family, I gotta provide supper
Trying to stay up out the gutter, that's why I relate to bowling
Knocking down pin-ups, I'm just in my lane rolling
In that black 760, Fields got that loud
Bitches skinny-dipping, and we fresh up out of towels
I smell that at home, that's that YSL
And if I wasn't rapping, you'd be asking why I sell
Baby, it's the coalition; I work like a slave
Now my whip is mint condition -- they hate and it's a shame
Cause they deal with shit like women
That's why I'm yelling, "Fuck 'em!"
Hustle for tomorrow cause yesterday means nothing
That's why

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Troy Ave]
Dope be the game, Troy Ave be the name
I be shining like a motherfucker, wearing four chains
I do it for my city, yeah, the niggas in the chains
Making all their collect calls, knowing I could be in the same place
I still run base
Three strike laws, trying to make it home safe
Went from a buck to an ounce to an eighth
Now a nigga pull big amounts in my safe
Keys open doors, I profit off raw
The phrase, "Let me cook" mean a whole lot more
To my niggas, my dealers, my killers
We the triple threat if you add it to hoes' feelings
Oh baby, go crazy, give me top with the top off
I had a Benz 'fore this rap shit popped off
Fact, grinding like a motherfucker still
Got the streets yelling, "Powder!"; I'm major without a deal
For real

[Hook]
