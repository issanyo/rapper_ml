I'm driving round in that [?] black [?] is extended
Take 22 like you envy
Your life, get empty
I'm driving round in that [?] black [?] is extended
Take 22 like you envy
Your life, get empty
Your life, get empty
Your life, get empty
You start the beef and I finish
Your life, get empty
Your life, get empty
Your life, get empty
You start the beef and I finish

I am selling [?] ladies know I got it
And the hammer's on my waist, and I'm safety [?]
Glock on with that laser sight, I'm allergic to the hater type
I take your life, that's the fact and on the block we [?] flipping packs
I'm just getting money, ain't no ifs, or mights or maybes
Riding on to Brooklyn in a silver black Mercedes
[?] hate me, but it's just [?] I be shining [?]
I don't get mad [?] I get on my grind
He doing the little time
[?] put ice [?] but if [?] that day

I'm driving round in that [?] black [?] is extended
Take 22 like you envy
Your life, get empty
I'm driving round in that [?] black [?] is extended
Take 22 like you envy
Your life, get empty
Your life, get empty
Your life, get empty
You start the beef and I finish
Your life, get empty
Your life, get empty
Your life, get empty
You start the beef and I finish
