(Sounds of an exotic vehicle driving off)

(Chorus)
Paper, a whole lotta paper
Counting up my blessings dropping ashes on my haters
Smoking on Gelato, feeling like I'm Pablo hahahaha dig a hole nigga die slow
Crawl out, while I ball out when real niggas link up it won't be no fall out
If I'm really trying to fuck, I tell that bitch call out give her this work and give her work go get this half a brick of eightballs out (Powder!)

(Verse 1 - Sammy Gambino)
When the real link you best believe there ain't no fall out
Gambino baby you know I'm finna ball out
Troy Ave peeped the greatness ya'll know we about to make it
Hate on me for what dawg? I don't even say shit!
Sick of being humble like I don't put in the work
Like we ain't we come from a jungle, like we ain't come from the dirt
Niggas thought I was a lame just cause I didn't play sports
I was in and out of class nigga trying to dodge court
And now I'm cashing knowledge using chips you can't afford
See them J's is real cool, but I like these Gucci's more
Pops ain't give a damn, pack ya bags bout his grands
Papi wished he stayed around cause now he sees that I'm the man!
And when the money come, I don't want to get naughty
You wasn't with me at the bottom, you ain't about to get a dollar!
I grind till the day where I'm no longer breathing, cause they out here doing this for all the wrong reasons!

(Chorus)
Paper, a whole lotta paper
Counting up my blessings dropping ashes on my haters
Smoking on Gelato, feeling like I'm Pablo hahahaha dig a hole nigga die slow
Crawl out, while I ball out when real niggas link up it won't be no fall out
If I'm really trying to fuck, I tell that bitch call out give her this work and give her work go get this half a brick of eightballs out (Powder!)

(Verse 2 - Sammy Gambino)
They didn't see this coming I made 'em sick to they stomach
I prayed every night so my blessings came in abundance
This ain't no rap song nigga, this is my life
And if the game is a gamble, fuck it I'll roll dice
Now throw me in the jungle I survived with the lions
Five seven from my toes, but I move like a giant
I hit the block and hug it, I really be out here thuggin'
Due to the fact that I'm a get it all from nothing!
My father was a hustler and so was my older brother
I know how to treat people, I get that from my mother
So yes, I'm respected and I'm really well connected
So if there's a problem then you know we gon' check it
Ask G-Baby I don't give a fuck attitude
I rep it for the love, every block and every avenue
So miss me with the bullshit and try again later
My moms need a crib so I'm focused on the paper! (Wierdo!)

(Chorus)
Paper, a whole lotta paper
Counting up my blessings dropping ashes on my haters
Smoking on Gelato, feeling like I'm Pablo hahahaha dig a hole nigga die slow
Crawl out, while I ball out when real niggas link up it won't be no fall out
If I'm really trying to fuck, I tell that bitch call out give her this work and give her work go get this half a brick of eightballs out (Powder!)

(Repeat 2x)
Crawl out, while I ball out when real niggas link up it won't be no fall out
If I'm really trying to fuck, I tell that bitch call out give her this work and give her work go get this half a brick of eightballs out (Powder!)
