(Troy Ave Talking)
Turn it down, turn it down a little bit
Dope Boy Troy, word!
Supposed to drive everyday vrrroooommm
Throw a bass line in there too Troy

(Verse 1)
Age of 15 I jumped off the porch
8 years later jawn bought a porsche
A year before that went and bought a Benz
I'm fucking with these birds, fuck fake friends
Niggas got caught, but they didn't tell
Derek held water and I wished him well
Through them coins it was fifty bands soap
A nigga seen that, he started doing above
Been through some shit and I'm still here
Stand up nigga even in a wheelchair
My best friend died and I went to jail
Niggas switched sides, hope they burn in hell
Everything I thought was the opposite
Funny homies hanging with the opposites
Niggas tried to kill me, I be shot and shit
Difference is, when I try I be dropping shit

(Chorus)
If you wouldn't pray for me, pay for me
Or spray for me, you, it ain't shit you can say to me word! (4x)

(Verse 2)
I don't chase hoes, they be chasing me
I used to chase money, now it's racing me
Runnig through this dough like a bakery
Niggas hate on me and do it faithfully
How many whips do this nigga got?
How many cribs do this nigga got?

(Touchdown Brown)
Damn! and how manny of me do I really got? Damn!
I'll do anything for my brothers even lay down
And I love my brothers and I'll never let them down
But when we get it you know we lay them down
You know we killed the pussy and we never spared 'em!
We really switching rims like I never had 'em!

(Chorus 4 x)
