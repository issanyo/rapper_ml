Word Word

(Hook)
Fought for my life now I'm fighting for my freedom (Im'a win)
(word word)
Niggas wasn't loyal now you barely ever see 'em (it's the end)
(word word)
Ice on me make a African look Korean
(word word)
Im'a ride my Rari while my bitches ride the BM
(word word)

(Verse 1)
Impressing niggas ain't on my checklist
I give a fuck about you niggas perspective
They saying I'm moving like a thug and I'm reckless
But how the fuck you think I got this necklace?
Cars and cribs shit they don't got
Niggas tell you how to spend it never how to get guap
Self made nigga known to hold my shit hot
I'm gettin' money riding picture me rollin'! Nupac nigga!

(Hook)
Fought for my life now I'm fighting for my freedom
(word word)
Niggas wasn't loyal now you barely ever see 'em
(word word)
Ice on me make a African look Korean
(word word)
Im'a ride my Rari while my bitches ride the BM
(word word)

(2nd Hook)
I don't freestyle but I style for free (word word)
You ain't never met a dope boy as wild as me (word word)
My phone just went off no apologies ( word word)
And my earrings appraised for a college fee (word word)

(Verse 2)
LA to BK like the Dodgers be
I got a jersey on and I got a Glock on me
A nigga turn me on Im'a make him dot on the T
Shots go off and I'm dodging T

(Hook)
Fought for my life now I'm fighting for my freedom
(word word)
Niggas wasn't loyal now you barely ever see 'em
(word word)
Ice on me make a African look Korean
(word word)
Im'a ride my Rari while my bitches ride the BM
(word word)
