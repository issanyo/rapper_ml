[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
And the kid countin' bread, fuck countin' sheep
1300 counted thread but a nigga hardly sleep (nah)
Snooze and lose, I ain't taking no losses
I'm in the takin' trips and takin' flicks and [?]
Fast life living, success driven
Mad ice glistening, cookin' powder in the kitchen (powder)
Benny and [?] pay me what I deserve
Tell her rubber band the money, save the ones for the first
Put the P in
All pun intended
Punish that pussy, more hits then a penny
L.A. Dodgers, L.A. Leakers I to run base and put hot shit out the speakers
L.A. Dodgers, L.A. Leakers I to run base and put hot shit out the speakers
L.A. Dodgers, L.A. Leakers I to run base and put hot shit out the speakers
Troy Ave and in me you can trust
B.S.B. records the real ones fucking with us
I know I'm blessed because I ain't ash to dust
To the Lord we pray, but in gas we trust
Mothafuckas

[Verse 2]
I'm aimin', I'm bangin' to execute (get 'em Block)
Stay whippin' on these niggas that thinkin' they next to shoot
Race to the chips, I'm a nigga to double dip
Grip on the hip, packed ready to ship
Said bring the whip, we bout to take another trip
My whole gang spit, all tops with chrome Glocks
Waling on beats with reminisces of Funk Dots (Funk dot)
You kids are like a brand new pimple, ya won't pop (never)
Repping on these streets, that's something that won't stop
Born where they sling and bang and front the cops
I represent the niggas on corners that pump rocks (powder)
Wale 'em like them crackers that listen to Punk Rock
(I don't wanna be you)
Or roll, blocks, I stroll
Hot, or cold, I got a hunger for the dough
Flip em like a plow, push em through the snow
Block got the glow, Bruce Leroy flow
