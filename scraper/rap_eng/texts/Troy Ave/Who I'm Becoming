Bout to record this shit right now
(Bout to record this shit right now)
Word..Dope Boy Troy!

(Chorus)
I'm so glad in who I'm becoming (I'm becoming)
Maybe in the past I was buggin' (I was buggin')
Niggas tryin' to push me to the old me (the old me)
Back when I had fake friends as my homies (my homies)
Now I'm growing up like my paper (like my paper)
They see me glowing up they some haters (they some haters)
Niggas not gon' push me to the old me (to the old me)
Back when I had fake friends as my homies (my homies)

(Verse 1)
Came up on my own I had nothing
Niggas ain't give me work ain't no frontin'
Started with 10 grams got to the whole keys
Niggas started acting like they know me
Undentified ain't no favors
Undentifly 'em with all flavors
Money growing nigga, I got a whole tree
I said fuck the block and I went OT
First time I got rich was cocaine (was cocaine)
Bitches on my dick see them chains (see them chains)
Niggas on my dick it's a shame (it's a shame)
It's a shame..

(2nd Chorus)
Real street shit all my niggas eating shit (Fuck them niggas!)
They ain't eating now unless they eating shit
I got 3 car garages sometimes I don't see my whips
Of success, rolls spider webs on my seat and shit
More Money More Problems, I'm inviting all the stress
Thirty one round 40 and a mothafucking vest
Out on half a million bail half a million ain't no stress
Thanking god, praising god cause I'm blessed, mothafucka!

(Chorus)
I'm so glad in who I'm becoming (I'm becoming)
Maybe in the past I was buggin' (I was buggin')
Niggas tryin' to push me to the old me (the old me)
Back when I had fake friends as my homies (my homies)
Now I'm growing up like my paper (like my paper)
They see me glowing up they some haters (they some haters)
Niggas not gon' push me to the old me (to the old me)
Back when I had fake friends as my homies (my homies)

(Verse 2)
Yeah, I'm relaxing money grabbing
Haters mad they say I'm bragging
I'm just laughing
My life Gucci like the fashion see the dragon
Matching shoes cause they platinum, I ain't platinum
Just the socks on my calfskin a hundred cash in
Anywhere a diamond tester is my jewelry passion
Fake niggas throwing traps but I'm cruising past them
Weed and Foreigns all them gassin' they just gassin'
I like bitches with some class and, no more ratchet
Unless they hear they favorite songs and want to pop they ass in
Put my music in they captions when they snappin'
They just love the fact that I'm eating that I don't be cappin'
I ain't no fuck nigga

(2nd Chorus)
Real street shit all my niggas eating shit (Fuck them niggas!)
They ain't eating now unless they eating shit
I got 3 car garages sometimes I don't see my whips
Of success, rolls spider webs on my seat and shit
More Money More Problems, I'm inviting all the stress
Thirty one round 40 and a mothafucking vest
Out on half a million bail half a million ain't no stress
Thanking god, praising god cause I'm blessed, mothafucka!

(Chorus)
I'm so glad in who I'm becoming (I'm becoming)
Maybe in the past I was buggin' (I was buggin')
Niggas tryin' to push me to the old me (the old me)
Back when I had fake friends as my homies (my homies)
Now I'm growing up like my paper (like my paper)
They see me glowing up they some haters (they some haters)
Niggas not gon' push me to the old me (to the old me)
Back when I had fake friends as my homies (my homies)
