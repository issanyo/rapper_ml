(Verse)
Who the hottest in New York? It’s really no debating
Real niggas say Ave the fake suckers be hatin
Like he nice but that nigga read rhymes off his iPhone
No, nigga I’m texting your girl meet me at my home
I always had dreams of a million while they was chillin
I’m a new Benz 4 wheelin from dope dealing
With a Rollie off crack and a Rollie off rap
But I hit you a few times if you tryna take that
I’m ticked off, got on from a brick of salt
Was getting mad money OT when it kicked off
Out here I had a spot two doors down with heaters in the wall
And the fiends lined up like sneakers on the wall
Watch for the sneaks in the hall you peep
When you get em high, 05, take you down at yo peek
I done made widows made niggas get the point
I mush the codeine without the PCP in my joint
8 trey bags, shipped in for marijuana
Got my chips up, had em flown in from Kilofornia
For the lower price, a nigga done rolled the dice
Lost 100 grams once, I ain't mail the shit twice
Made a tray already, I'm still up they could have it
Ain’t like I can call and say, where’s my package?
If I take a loss then fuck it, I’m still gon eat
But as long as a nigga undefeated in these streets
It’s all good, it’s all good
Baby it’s all good, it’s all good
I’m from a broke hood
Where the guns go (blap)
And these niggas runnin
Cus they fuckin hoes
And we them niggas
And you fuckin know
Troy Ave motherfucker, I’m about to blow

(Hook)
While you was kissin that bitch under the mistletoe
I was hustling this shit, had to get this dough
Everything was all good but now that her man know
He gon put holes in yo ass like a tic tac toe
Nigga life’s a gamble, I’m into the risk
I bet it all every day just to get to the chips
I can’t afford to be played or get killed for a bitch
Thank the Lord as we pray, Merry White Christmas

(Verse)
I’m on a BQE with 2 pistols in the car
And the light uptown, big booty spanish broad
You know a nigga picky, hovain here with me
And my homie Hennessey D, whippin the 7-60
Later on at night I’mma bury it in the dope
But for now I’m hitting Queens up for a plate of that curry coke damn
I don’t know what the fuck I want on the side
Matter fact you can give a nigga macaroni pie
I stay with cheese and shells, my squares flow steady
It’s really like I’m here eating already
I got 400 in this shoebox for real
I’m 600 away from making a mill
Give me 2 M’s today, I’m taking a deal
But for now this the motherfuckin gangsta grill

(Hook)
While you was kissin that bitch under the mistletoe
I was hustling this shit, had to get this dough
Everything was all good but now that her man know
He gon put holes in yo ass like a tic tac toe
Nigga life’s a gamble, I’m into the risk
I bet it all every day just to get to the chips
I can’t afford to be played or get killed for a bitch
Thank the Lord as we pray, Merry White Christmas

(Outro)
Merry White Christmas
My gift to the world is nothing but dope music
I promise to restore the feeling
Men do what they say and say what they mean
I told niggas I was gonna blow the fuck up
Oh!
Keep spreading the word
Keep spreading the gospel
Let these motherfuckers know
Troy Ave that nigga
Aye listen man
I told niggas I’m worth 1.2 million
They laughed at me
Now look
The price went the fuck up
I need 2 million
I mean I’m just counting money right now in this motherfucker mane(PowderRRR)
B$B them niggas man
We got the highest quality of street music across the lane
I represent the east coast, New York City
Real niggas worldwide just like me
It’s a fact though
B$B records, the future is here
I’m the only nigga, not spittin chuck shit in yo ear
Yea, I seen other niggas get on
What I do?
I never hate it
I stay humble and stay working
And I waited my motherfucking turn
I'm lying I ain't wait my turn, I made my turn
Yea
Harry Powder, Gangsta Grillz, ya bastards
