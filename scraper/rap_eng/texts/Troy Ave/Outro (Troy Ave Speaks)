Shoutout to everybody that’s been supporting man, it’s free Troy Ave ‘til they free me, ya heard? Soon as I get a bail I’m up out of here. Then the world will know the truth. Everybody know I’m innocent. I know I’m good ‘cause my faith been in god.

I ain’t one of them niggas that pray when times is bad, nigga been praying, know what I’m saying? And it’s just like, like I was telling my moms and my lawyer, I feel like I’m climbing up the hill and shit. And goddamn god is like “Yo, nah nigga you gotta come back to the bottom of the hill. I’m ‘bout to send you on another trip, somewhere bigger, somewhere higher.” And I’m like, “Yo, but I been climbing up this hill, like I’m almost there.” God is like- hold on -God is like “down the hill bruh”. He’s like, “Nah, the way I’m ‘bout to show you, you need different type of tools. Take that coat off, ‘cause you goin’ for the nonstop. You gotta get [?], you know what I'm saying? You gotta have all the right type of shit to go where I’m ‘bout to send you.” It’s ‘bout to get greater later.

So this just a minor setback for a major comeback. And this is time that I needed to reflect, and just to get my shit together, you know what I'm saying? I would’ve never been [?] like that, feel me? Now I’m just tryna take it to the next level so I appreciate everybody supporting a nigga and shit. And you know, nothing but positive energy man. That’s a fact though. This shit fucked up, this shit hurt, far as like losing one of my close niggas.

Free Troy Ave ‘til we finished yo, RIP Banga.
