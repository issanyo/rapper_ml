Oo girl I want you closer
Hold on adjust my holster
Dance now, real nigga in the building
Fuck girl, fake niggas in their feelings

Oo girl I want you closer
Hold on adjust my holster
Dance now, real nigga in the building
Fuck girl, fake niggas in their feelings

Word
My heart cold, ice colder than my chest
I don't front like I wish you nothing but the best
I've wish I've jailed and I've wished you death
I've wished their mumma hold all their tears lil bitch wet
I once shot a nigga in their neck
I was tired of your disrespect
(adlibs)
He was ready waiting
A stomach full of a nigga, steady hating
I love paper so I'm steady chasing
Called the mob on my grandpa, amazin'
I get out of things with a handshake
I pull out a middle finger till your man's fake
In my pool where I do my dance
Do it in the club, got it in my pants
Phoney you I call bluffs I'll take ya gun from you and shoot ya in the skull

Oo girl I want you closer
Hold on adjust my holster
Dance now, real nigga in the building
Fuck girl, fake niggas in their feelings

Oo girl I want you closer
Hold on adjust my holster
Dance now, real nigga in the building
Fuck girl, fake niggas in their feelings
Fake niggas in their feelings
Fake niggas in their feelings
Fake niggas in their feelings
Fake niggas in their feelings
Fake niggas in their feelings
Fake niggas in their feelings
Fake niggas in their feelings
Fuck y'all, fake niggas in their feelings

Freddie will keep it fake
I'm taking my shotty till it's fuck the snakes
The one in my jeans got a hol' of me
Lance making gucci look coney
Might leave that shit in my laundry
I used to get clean at (?)
I used to dry clean on my money
Cause you know I watch I can't front this
Every day, four more straight, never miss like I pray
Lord keep these haters and these police away
Pray that they got me four brick in the yay
Back when I drove a truck by Chevrolet
It ain't ever come to panama
That's what he say
Charge it to the game and I ball anyway
I play it in the club you could be my Lisa Ray, Bae!

Oo girl I want you closer
Hold on adjust my holster
Dance now, real nigga in the building
Fuck girl, fake niggas in their feelings

Oo girl I want you closer
Hold on adjust my holster
Dance now, real nigga in the building
Fuck girl, fake niggas in their feelings
