[Intro]
Someone tried to take my life away
I understand
But me I will not let them
Of course not Godfather
If it hadn't been for the grace of God
Amen
Along with the courage, honor and dignity
That I have for myself and this family
I would not be here today
But since I am it's going to be hell to pay
Arrivederci
Dope boy Troy nigga

[Hook]
BSB Mafia, I am Don T
Big plate of pasta
In the back is Don C
Pendejos tried to snake your bro
But I cut the grass low
So that now I can see
BSB Mafia, I am Don T
Big plate of pasta
In the back is Don C
Pendejos tried to snake your bro
But I cut the grass low
So that now I can see

[Verse 1]
Fuck niggas talking 'bout how it's all love
Nowadays my rebuttal is a shoulder shrug
I know what it is, I'm aware of what it was
Ain't a judge but I judge a man by what he does
When the pressure's on and it's getting intense
I'm already a shooter, are you good on defense?
All around players, only ones that make sense
Fuck up out my team, don't even want you on my bench
Sucker free, that is me, nigga in every sense
It's clear to see who with me when I'm in the trench
Niggas yelling loyalty but that ain't what they meant
They loyalty have legs I'm like damn where it went?
Dope Boy Troy nigga

[Hook]
BSB Mafia, I am Don T
Big plate of pasta
In the back is Don C
Pendejos tried to snake your bro
But I cut the grass low
So that now I can see
BSB Mafia, I am Don T
Big plate of pasta
In the back is Don C
Pendejos tried to snake your bro
But I cut the grass low
So that now I can see

[Verse 2]
Fucked up in the game
Going through all this pain
Wondering why I ain't, hearing bout no pain
Coward ass, nigga don't even try to come explain
You know who you are, I ain't gotta say your name
Mazerati pedal on my way to the next
Controversy kills but not more than success
Cristal sipping all them bottles was mine
I share with the crew I let everybody shine
Groupie niggas wanna hang call that nigga Shane
He ain't call my phone cause I call that boy a lame
How are you a gangster when you rarely getting bling
But I'm a real boss I take the loss and the bling
They say I can't sell shows so I'm selling cocaine
While y'all weigh up the stone
I'ma dance in the rain
I am not a Prince, I'm a mo'fuckin' King
Dope Boy, King Troy and this track is fuckin' flames
Dope Boy Troy nigga

[Hook]
BSB Mafia, I am Don T
Big plate of pasta
In the back is Don C
Pendejos tried to snake your bro
But I cut the grass low
So that now I can see
BSB Mafia, I am Don T
Big plate of pasta
In the back is Don C
Pendejos tried to snake your bro
But I cut the grass low
So that now I can see

[Outro/Interlude]
This the new sucker free BSB
I'm 0% for you if you ain't 100% for me
Disloyal ass niggas ran and left me fighting for my life
I was down to die for them niggas
They was ten feet behind me when shit popped off
Gon' talk about we left 'cause we ain't no what was doing on
Nigga you ain't come to find the fuck out what was going on
Niggas owe me more than that
I heard you out here pumping lies playing victim bout Troy Ave came home and Ave ain't thinking right, nigga I'm thinking real
I sat in jail you niggas wasn't riding for me you was just riding with me. You's a coward and you gon' die broke nigga
You ain't ever invest a coin into me nigga, ever
It was always been my plans, it was always been my money
I just let you take the credit so you can shine
Glorified ass assistant man if I'm lying nigga, do it again
You made Troy Ave right? Make another one
Cheap motherfucker, I gave niggas monthly money I paid niggas every show I bought niggas shearlings and furs I bought niggas rolex watches
I put niggas on the radio, I put niggas in the game
I ain't have to do that, that ain't the norm
Niggas owe me more than that then they leave me for dead
Niggas owe me more than that then they look at Banks shot and bleeding on the floor and keep it moving that karma gon' be a motherfucker
