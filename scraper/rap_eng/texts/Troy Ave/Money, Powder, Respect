[Verse 1: Young Lito]
It's Lito, I'm sure you've probably heard it before
If I ain't breaking the law, I'm blazing the [?]
Got my money up, ironically my safe in the floor
Stash full of racks, you'll think I'm building a store
In the club making it pour, buckets of rose
[?] full of hoes that can't pronounce the name of my clothes
I hustle, moms think I'm getting money off shows
But I'm still in the hood, with a duffle of O's
While she out playing lotto, I'm paying Pablo
'Bout to get a Benz, but I want a Gallardo
Stay humble, stay working, yea that's the motto
And I could delete my Twitter, the Feds will still follow
When you niggas was working, I was getting work in
Block shaking like the ass on a bitch twerkin'
Brother need bail, and my bitch need a Birkin
Wrist full of cuts, but y'all bum niggas hurtin

[Verse 2: Troy Ave]
Money, Powder Respect, it's the keys of life
I bought my first kilo and said "Jesus Christ"
Jesus with the cross, talking 'bout praising
Drought gonna cost, shit, I'm talking 'bout raising
The price, neck full of ice
Cold, young nigga hot temper take a life
Death want the crown, watch with the crown
Time to get busy, get down or lay down with the crew
BSB, Hoody Hoo
No limit spender, what it cost boo?
Im 'bout it, I'm the plug, street's my outlet
In and out of town, made a stop at the outlet
Night nigga, just do it
I'm getting coke money, but I swore its just music
On the low though, plenty photos
Cheesing with the bitches as a rapper
But I'm a king cracker, dead man stacker
New hundos, new hun's blow after
I know what they after, before I lead you on
Pull over your thong, once my nut bust
They don't get a fucking coin, ching-a-ling it's the players club poker
Got a couple 9's and 4-5's for jokers
Powder

[Verse 3: Avon Blocksdale]
Money, Powder, Respect from squeezing rounds from the tec
Flex, I lift and aim and shoot you in the chest
My baretta leave more holes than [?]
Questions 'bout my crew, know we all lethal
Blocksdale the illest when it comes to the chicks
Keep a blip on my waist, don't let it bust in your face
When it come to the [?] , stretch that
Chrome 38 to protect that, respect that?
Or the ruga leave your head where your neck at, fuck harder
I let the shot, your body drop, you shoulda duck smarter
Like Tip I ain't got no time for no little flip, I need a brick
Seventh series when I will, desert for the kill
They say I won't survive in this game called rap
Nigga I ain't give a fuck, I run the game called crack
Violate an open palm, play a game called smack
Advice to the haters, my knife really cut
My gun really blazes, color be a stainless
And I'm aiming where your brain is

[Verse 4: King Sevin]
Yea
If I ain't fuck with a nigga, I won't pretend to
I'm always on point, sharper than a Ginsu, cut niggas short
Talking all this money shit
Cause when I see 'em they broke, where all that money went?
He ain't got it, you could look him in the eyes, these the same motherfuckers that be callin' for a ride
But they talking all this bullshit, Ricky Ross shit
Someone check his temperature, I think he lost it
Type of nigga to get shot, get stabbed, but don't do nothing about it but get mad
And get [?], I'm coming back fast
LeBron James with the heat on me, and a black mask
These niggas all ass, but what I'ma do now
Talking all greasy till he's [?] than new now
But I won't rest till you stretched like a rubber
I ain't [?] no [?] till I violate your mother
Motherfucker
