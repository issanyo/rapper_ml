[Intro]
The money in the streets will manipulate so many kids
Cause they seen so much money out here
You know the history of the south bro you know
Either you got a jump shot or you sold that rock

[Verse 1]
That bsb shit you heard i was weighed up
Thinking I was sitting up above freaked out
So easy I'm feeling carierving with the rap
Feeling like myself cause I’m getting all this gwack
I’m feeling like Martin Luther and my only pieces of
Ruga I shoot you on the spot playing you playing
Troy Ave is the man I made a hundred grand fuck
The sand scan and my rari see’s ten different colours
Of my chicks you a hater we shitting on eat it with the

And while you chewing down we going to bring your bitch through
Shorty popping off automatic pistol gun young Lito 10 hundred

Baking soda whip it good and have a feen come lick the pot

Verse 3

The other day my mama told me she happy that i’m living
And she don’t want to talk about them days up in that prison
The only reason I spent some days up in that prison, grab
That bail money came and got me nigga now i’m in it
