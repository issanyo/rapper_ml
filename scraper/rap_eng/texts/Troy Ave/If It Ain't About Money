[Intro: Troy Ave]
Nyc to Ac, You heard ?
Nigga Uptown, downtown
(Troy Ave, BSB)
Around and you getting found
(Pyro)

[Troy Ave]
Uptown, downtown
(From Nada To Prada)
Around and you getting found
(We on the come up, self made niggas)
(You heard, Sosa Gucci Prada, What up!)
(Powder)

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
If it ain't About money
I don’t know what to say
If you ain't a bad bitch
Then shorty, you in the way
Only fuck with real niggas
I be with 'em everyday
You can hate, all you want cause
I'm getting it anyway

[Verse 1: Pyro Prada]
Stacking, my pockets looking obese
Clothes, jewels and shoes, everything is unique
Your bitch, Shop at the mall mines in a boutique
This hustling in my blood, my D.N.A. is the streets
Patron in the cup
Sour d in the dutch, either that or the purple leaning without a crutch
Feenin’ I got that dope ,the flow raw and uncut
Fly dominican nigga, I'm turnt, all the way up
Now turn this all the way up, and turn them lame niggas off
The barrel on the shotty, it look like a car exhaust
To keep it a hundred, I'm not the nigga you wanna cross
Don't speak to me directly, nigga go get your boss
I know some real hitters in Brooklyn to get you offed
And just in case, I got a jew lawyer to get me off
These haters, is no threats, really, they piss me off
And when they see me floss, it remind 'em of all they flaws

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
If it ain't About money
I don’t know what to say
If you ain't a bad bitch
Then shorty, you in the way
Only fuck with real niggas
I be with 'em everyday
You can hate, all you want cause
I'm getting it anyway

[Verse 2: Troy Ave]
If it ain't about no money, i dont know what to say
Powder to the people, i don't know shit but yay
Rubberband man, flipping to get the pay
Dollar after dollar, im getting it everyday
Niggas know what time it is, that's with or without my rollie
You try and you die, im into shooting like kobe
One to the chest, two in your face, trey pound grippin brooklyn my birthplace
But i'm dead fly, the bad guy thats me, T-R-O-Y A-V-E
Chaser of the paper, coming up like a pacer
Nigga you see me ballin, you mad you fucking hater
Wanna beef nigga?, be sicker, die slow
I'm a street nigga, the heat nigga, pyro
Pyrex with the flame, my neck with the bling
Bs bx nigga, we that shit oh man

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
If it ain't About money
I don’t know what to say
If you ain't a bad bitch
Then shorty, you in the way
Only fuck with real niggas
I be with 'em everyday
You can hate, all you want cause
I'm getting it anyway

[Outro: Troy Ave]
We that shit nigga, troy ave, bsb dope boys
Ac to nyc, sosa music nigga
Harry powder in the flesh, getting money to the death
Ashes to ashes, cash, until it's nothing left
You niggas ain't right, we went left
Made a killing nigga, can't stop till we sitting on them millions nigga, powder
