[Verse 1: Kid Exquisite]
Who would've known I got rich of dope
If you ain't gon cop some you gotta go
Summer just ended I'm copping coats
Gotta stay fly heaving in the snow
We got the bottles and got the hoes
My bitch so bad that she model clothes
D's asking questions like I don't know
I break a pound and a lot of O's
Paper stacking I just stash that
Never swiping I just cash that
My stock going up ain't no NASDAQ
If you ain't my gang I can't pass that
I hit it once if her ass fat
I hit it twice if a pretty face
Maybe a third if she do me right
But after that baby I gotta skate
Saved my first 20 and tucked it
I fell in love with the hustle
These rapper be jokes, they be busting
They ain't even in the discussion
My flow so retarded, disgusting
My trap be so busy I'm rushing
Bad little bitch and she Russian
My money so long and she love it
I'm getting calls from my custies
Everyday shit, I ain't rusty
You can't even smell me, or touch me
The work in the movement you trust me
Try to make it to the rap game but the trap holding me hostage
I ain't doing no crime
If I ain't making no profit

[Hook: Kid Exquisite]
Get it back, spend it
Get it back, spend it
Make it back, flip it
Make it back, flip it
Smoke, sip
Money, bitches
Smoke, sip
Money, bitches

[Verse 2: Troy Ave]
(Dope boy Troy)
Real shooter real shooter and a real hooper (bow booowww)
Rolland harder but I never hung with Mr. Cooper (oh nooo)
If she bad, and I'm hanging with her Imma do her
Shitting bad, on my license plate is young manure (skrrrrttt)
Horse power, big money, I'm a boss power (word)
Chalk game, shot brain, catching moss power (ya heard?)
Randy Macho Man, listen bitch I'm not yo man
All I love is cheese, you can keep the fucking nachos man
Different chips, purple when I play at Borgata (roulette)
D and G, doing good, Dolce Gabbana (I'm wet)
Shirt brother, bear arms but the worst cover (sauce, sauce)
Had my dog go and pick up 5 birds from my mother (of course, of course)
Cooked the brick in 18 minutes at a hotel (quick)
Sent the little bitch to rid it, thats a ho sale (lick)
Rarely competition when you flip em wholesale (powder, powder)
I spend money, I get Money if you don't the oh well

[Hook: Kid Exquisite]
Get it back, spend it
Get it back, spend it
Make it back, flip it
Make it back, flip it
Smoke, sip
Money, bitches
Smoke, sip
Money, bitches
