[Hook]
Real eyes realize real lies nigga
Came alone just me you heard
Real eyes realize real lies nigga
Came alone just me you heard
Real eyes realize real lies nigga
Word, word
Real eyes realize real lies nigga

[Verse 1]
Niggas like to talk the talk
With bullet holes in my legs I still walk the walk
Right now I’m at the lowest point in my life
But I’m a win cause God shielding me safe flight
It’s not needed, all I’m searching for is answers
I ain’t gonna get it from these strippers and these dancers
Deep thoughts and shallow waters ain’t gonna never match
We ain’t compatible baby I need a better batch
I know my lyrics resonate with all the real niggas
I hope the fake will tell it I will never feel niggas
No more Jessie evil cause it ain’t productive
These callous fake tough niggas they not destructive
Bout to trade in these [?] for pimp Pradas
They got me in these Obama’s when I’m a Louboutin-a
Patience is a virtue, all this correct
Doing all this fuckingtoll on my Rolex
Can’t wait to get back in my king sized bed
With women round my seat with their lips on my head
Out the hole [?] cash in the [?]
One eight out this misery downing me like a beau
I’m running through the money like a bridge with a tow
I wouldn’t touch a bitch with a six foot pole
I’m running through the money like a bridge with a tow
When I run into that bridge with a six feet motherfucker

[Hook]
Real eyes realize real lies nigga
Came alone you heard word
Real eyes realize real lies nigga
Allow me, about it
Real eyes realize real lies nigga
Came alone you heard word
Real eyes realize real lies nigga
Allow me, about it

[Verse 2]
Good energy across the phone line
That’s cause I hate the home line
Talking to the ones who really love m
We celebrating when I get home I’m drinking bubbly
A couple friends feeling guilty and they should
The way they did me was sad and no good
I guess I’m loyal to the wrong ones
They show their true colors in the long run
But life’s a marathon, not a race
Keep your pace I don’t care bout you beat a race
Nigga people smiling in your face
No one know the time that they wanna take your place
The back stabbers in the bundles
Niggas quick to change up they do not keep it one hunnid
They turn bitches what the motherfucking girls different
And make you look at the motherfucking world different
You get locked up and get fat
Turn around and so called friends would turn rats
It gotta feel worse than your cheating wife
I’m facing years longer than my life
You ever won and crowned the king
You ever been silenced when you want to vent
On the road to riches Riker’s wasn’t in the stops
Can’t wait to get on stage and see the crowd rock
Fuck em homie

[Hook]
Real eyes realize real lies nigga
Came alone you heard, howdy
Real eyes realize real lies nigga
Allow me to, word
Real eyes realize real lies nigga
Came alone you heard, howdy
Real eyes realize real lies nigga
Word, word

[Verse 3]
Don’t be a dumb nigga pick up a book
Instead of doing fake crimes like a halfway crook
I don’t wanna hear about your worst stories
Look, to be honest man you niggas bore me
I’m on the ladder of success and always climbing
Every level I see common sense and always counting
Niggas busy getting high I’m the dealer, not the user
I ain’t with the bullshit, I’m a document and shoot a nigga dead
You ain’t no stand up nigga
Stand down while I piss on you fucking clowns
They kept my iced out chain and watch for evidence
With this I’m a buy some more of them things with presidents
Dead or alive I’m pulling through and swiftly
The most winning drug dealer turned rapper in AMerican history
Show the street life, gambled and came up against the odds
Kept the devil out my soul cause I’m a soldier of God
Place his love for material shit I afford
I’m slowly  transitioning for living by the sword
But in the meantime staying sharp
Pastime I cut coke with acetone so it won’t they heart when they sniffing
Straight baking soda if they whipping
Sororities still get extras and don’t even know the difference

[Outro]
Just tell the inmate leave me alone I’m writing rhymes
Can’t wait to leave here and get back on my grind nigga
Real eyes realize real lies nigga
Came alone you heard, howdy
Real eyes realize real lies nigga
[?] howdy
