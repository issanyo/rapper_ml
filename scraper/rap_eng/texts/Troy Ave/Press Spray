[Intro]
God gone sort these Niggas out
It's called divine intervention

[Verse:1]
I been not gave a fuck, now i don't give a fuck more
I been shot been persecuted by the law
I got my own people coming to attack
But this is how it go in the hood when your black
Man this shit wack like a Joe Budden track
And some would say damn ave why you saying that
Cuse he lied to my face in my back spilled crap
Pumped up  to talk down who gassed that
Jealousy is fake, seen boy do the same shit to Drake
We both fuck women that he date
When it comes to hoes he wears a cape
I wear icy face but no time being spent on a bum bitch
I'm a rich nigga but I'm on the dumb shit
Hating ass nigga I don't fuck with, got my name in your mouth you the cum fits
You a drug addict and a bitch beater
Rap podcast and a dick eater
Tryna see how my balls taste, ask your chick she in the vid licking my face, Nasty!
And when you asked about her she say Joe don't smack me!
You's a bitch dawg

[Bridge]
Truth is light, I son these lames
Niggas won't get away with my name
Troy ave is hot they want the flame
They careers down the hill I'm boarding the plane

Truth is light, I son these lames
Niggas won't get away with my name
Troy ave is hot they want the flame
They careers down the hill I'm boarding the plane

[Chorus]
These dweebs call me a bozo from their perspective, of course you can't understand a nigga that's getting this money when you broke It's what i expected


[Verse:2]
Niggas be cold tryna feed off heat
My foreign's get drove while they be on feet
Mad as fuck, sad as fuck, callused up
Times is hard life is rough
No dice, mice, and the hoes for real its been 20 years since your record deal
You need a dad or a uncle Phil, someone to say it ain't right to steal
You cried in court like a fucking dill, pickle nigga you's a fickle nigga, you 44 don't mean shit lil nigga
Fecal matter's eat shit lil nigga
Talk to me about shit lil nigga, til you apologize to the guy, you robbed for a ring and money up by the point when he was giving you a cabbie ride
Crack head you doing crimes Brack head
Crack head get on my top like a black head
You the, general of general admission outside the club no bread to get in
You go click to click, dick to dick
Oh lil nigga i didn't forget, remember you was signed to the game, what happened to the ruff ryder thang
I remember seeing you outside my show in the fucking rain yelling yo troy ave you doing your thang
Niggas talk shit out the same lips that they suck dick
Niggas talk shit out the same lips that they suck dick
Why do niggas suck dick out the same lips that they talk shit
I don't do shit you niggas is bi-bi-bitch!

Dont f- act like you dont remember nigga
It was a problem, you was sitting in the back, with a bum ass coat on in the rain
Your stupid fucking face
Your stupid fucking sesame street face


[Chorus]
These dweebs call me a weirdo from their perspective, of course you can't understand a nigga that's getting this money when they broke it's what i expected
Listen!
These dweebs call me a weirdo from their perspective, of course you can't understand a nigga that's getting this money when they broke it's what i expected


[Outro]
I made you boy, I gave you fame
Gave you an allowance, gave you the game
I let you rep, i made you gang, now its a shame you went Hovane
Niggas ain't show up to the hospital when I was shot
That means that the bitch made in grates, oh everything i done for em they forgot
It's sad cause i really had love for him
Was down to die and catch slugs for him
But when your boy needed help i looked around and damn there wasn't none for em
