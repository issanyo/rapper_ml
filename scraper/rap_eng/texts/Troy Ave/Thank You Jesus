[Intro]
Never be ashamed to pay and promote
I give praise, so I get less stressings and more blessings
That’s a fact though, powder

[Verse 1]
I know I been busy out here being a boss
I know I be bust with all of this floss
I know it’s all due to you of course
Of course, of course, of course
Sometimes we get caught up with all of the grind
Sometimes we get caught up with all of the shine
But we can’t be too caught up to keep you on our mind
When things be rough, people look up to the sky
But when things be good, same ones forget why
But not I, I ain’t shy, I send my praises up high

[Hook]
Thank you Jesus, for giving me this gwap
All that I got, I’m grateful for you
Thank you Jesus, for giving me this gwap
All that I got, I’m thankful to you

[Verse 2]
I got a lot of close friends sitting in jail
I pick up all their calls and answer their mail
I easily could’ve been in there as well
As well, as well, as well
We do a lot of wrong, lord we mean well
The devil working strong to uneven the scale
It’s important to keep balance, can’t fall to hell
In the world so fake, lord it’s hard being real
If I don’t feel safe, on the lord I’ma kill
I think god is forgiving me
I don’t enjoy it but that’s the way I deal with some of my enemies
I am right versus wrong, why is right under attack?
And they pushing these agendas against everything you back
Sad but true
They hate on me but I don’t care ‘cause they hated on you

[Hook]
Thank you Jesus, for giving me this gwap
All that I got, I’m thankful to you
Thank you Jesus, for giving me this gwap
All that I got, I’m grateful for you

[Outro]
I’m not putting no autotune on that
We gon’ keep it 100
You gotta keep it 100 with god
I get down every day and I pray
Sometimes twice a day
I ain’t on drugs or nothing either, I’m super sober
I’m just sippin’ champagne out the BSB cup
We just vibing
Nowadays I got way less stresses and way more blessings
Never be too ashamed to praise god
