[Intro: Audrey Rose]
This is the feature presentation
I made you, uh
Yeah yeah, Audrey Rose

[Verse 1: Audrey Rose]
You were all on one, never got much in return
Take a second to think who held you down baby at your worse?
Over again I sacrificed for you
Could you love me? Could you love me?
Oh, how it hurts to see you with someone
When I was the one who made you who you are

[Hook: Audrey Rose]
I worked for that love, I suffered enough
I feel so abandoned, let you take advantage
I worked for that love, (that love, that love, that love)
That love, (that love, that love, that love)
For that love, (that love, that love, that love)
For that love, (that love, that love, that love)
I worked for that love

[Verse 2: Audrey Rose]
In a different place, see baby I don't even blame her
You know the real, can't lie I made you better
Where would you be if I'd never held you down, down, down?
Oh, baby how it hurts to see you with someone when
I was the one who made you who you are

[Hook: Audrey Rose]

[Bridge: Audrey Rose]
So numb, I can't feel
My heart can't repair from the damage you've done
I'm so disgusted, did it all for nothing
The way you changed it's true to something
(I ain't changed girl!)
I know one day you'll regret that you let me leave

[Verse 3: Troy Ave]
You can't tell who you want boo
I'm who you want, true story is
I'm a big dog, and I dumped you
Went through my phone, got hurt and know I'm mad
You ain't the only girl present for Troy Ave
All the bo-ho's, for kiss on your boo-boo
Cry me a river, got a boat, I'm a cruise through
Baby, I'm already waving
What's love gotta do with it?
Turn around the clock crazy
When I met you I had a Benz in advance
So how you gonna say you made me who I am?
You FKA, Hugh Hef playmates
Want the cover boy, you already know [?]

[Hook: Audrey Rose]
