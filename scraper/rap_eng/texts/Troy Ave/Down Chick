(Verse 1)
I wanna treat you special cause you the one I adore
I want to spoil you and buy you things and buy you some more
I want to get you pregnant I want to fuck you raw
I want us to be winning when they look up at the score
Time is money I got plenty they just buzzin' about our beater
Shooting pictures to your phone like you don't know that I'ma cheater
I don't bring home STD's or BAD's so they really hating on you just indirectly through me
And you know that, misery loves company and they show that
You just flip 'em like linden where we used to watch the show at
Before all the fame and strangers yelling my name
Just people I dealt caine

(Hook 1)
It was me and down ass chick
The one who never switched love me when I'm broke
Or when I'm filthy fucking rich, shit I was never broke
But I ain't have this many chips thumbing through some shit
C'mere give me a kiss
Dame beso, countin' these pesos
Sippin' on XO then we gone sex slow
Dame beso, countin' these pesos
Sippin' on XO then we gone sex slow

(Verse 2)
My boo thang been through things
Remember when you took the two train to bring through caine
I ain't want you to call a cab the cops be on they raid
You met me on Atlantic Ave before the Mets played there
Wasn't no Barclays, we had matching ice no dark days
If I shine, you shine, should've walked them days
Gotten enough shade alone from your fat ass cousin
Who said I'm a dog and now she's the bitch that's nothing
Life's humbling as you see, I'm humble to just be free
Could've been booked you was in them books got a degree
And I'm proud of ya for no ocassion we go Asian
Mr. Chow's for ya I still can use chopsticks
Besides the leechy martini's it's just me and my bitch
She loved me before rap and it was me and my bricks
From the ground up you kept it official
I'm up now gotta lift you that's what real men do
Give me a kiss boo!

(Hook 2)
My down ass chick, the one who never switched
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fucking rich
Shit I was never broke but I ain't have this many chips
Thumbing through some shit c'mere give me a kiss
Dame beso, countin' these pesos
Sippin' on XO then we gone sex slow!
Dame beso, countin' these pesos
Sippin' on XO then we gone sex slow!
