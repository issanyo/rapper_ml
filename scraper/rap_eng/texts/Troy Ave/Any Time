[Hook - Troy Ave]
Anytime (anytime) anyplace I keep one with me
(Powder) la la la la la la la la la la (x2)

[Verse 1 - Troy Ave]
Harry Powder keep one its a snub
Haters all around it ain't all love
Could of been in jail all from dealing drugs
I could of been dead stories of what was
I’m celebrating life poppin bubbly
My champagne wish is to be sucka free
Believe these hoes let em keep sucking me
Don’t believe these hoes temporary company
My pockets on perm yeah my paper straight
I’m in the streets eating need a paper plate
It ain’t no barbecue why you niggas grilling?
Now when I fire up your grill they’ll say why you kill em'?
Bang bang BSB gang Brick Star boys dealing cocaine
Got me black and white stones I could yin or yang
My piece shine turn your eyes oriental bling

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]
Real California gangsta is what I claim to be
But this hip hop dope spot it came to me
Back tail with clientele dog bite with a lion tail
Soft white boss life all kite fly as hell
Cooked up zoned out wrong route
Hopped out hopped in u-turn hopped out
K’s up BAH BAH raise up blaze up
Back to the species That did take your breezy
Your ho is so easy fasheezy my neezy
This real two guns four hoes trap house one whip
Dope man coke head sushi with rice
Velvet satin lavish the life
And if you stare if you look you’ll get took
You will be one of them hoes in my book
Shabadu get revenue and I hooked up with Troy Avenue
And we get to this money while knockin new bitches
So vicious and that’s…..

[Hook]

[Outro]
Anytime anyplace nigga I will squeeze that iron at your face
Believe me if you try you dying I ain’t safe
As snoop said murder was the case
Don’t play with me I’m Troy A V E out the NYC shouts to LBC
LA New York Bel A spoon fork
All my niggas eating over here yaayayayay
