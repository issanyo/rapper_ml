[Chorus: Troy Ave]
Stupid ass bitch, stupid ass bitch
Getting money in this bitch, nigga, act like you know

[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Pull up to the front, yes I get it
Heard they got some bitches shaking ass, yeah, I'm with it
If you help me get the cash, baby, Imma trick it
A hundred in the G Waggen, and the Honda, yeah it's an exhibit
One that I slide, pimp a hoe ride
Stash box and mad fox, go inside
Givin niggas wings, still stay fly
Said that shit in Pac-Man, he ain't never lie
Bring out the protection, don't ask bout any quote
Hanging on the bible, before the rapping, it was Coke
Lord forgive me, I couldn't do minomom waidges
The lord always forgives me, cause I always give him his praizes

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
Stupid ass bitch, stupid ass bitch
Getting money in this bitch, nigga, act like you know

[Verse 2: Jadey Jade]
Pull up to the spot, and it's litted
Heard I got some niggas bustin cash, Imma get it
Knowing when they see this fat ass, they goin give it
Broke niggas, na, baller niggas be with it
Caught him with my eyes, looking like a prize
A thousand ones falling down my ass, back and thighs
Maly in my system, a bitch feelin high
Outfit on fleak, a bitch feelin fly

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
Stupid ass bitch, stupid ass bitch
Getting money in this bitch, nigga, act like you know
