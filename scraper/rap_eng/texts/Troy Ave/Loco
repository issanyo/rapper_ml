[Intro]
It's that temperature on low
[?]
Louboutins homie, Versace down
Everything, t-shirt, [?], socks
I got blood on my shoes, they from murder nigga

[Hook]
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em up, numerous shots from the four-four
See, I can't do promo, can't do no shows
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em up, numerous shots from the four-four
See, I can't do promo, can't do no shows
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em up, numerous shots from the four-four
See, I can't do promo, can't do no shows
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em up, numerous shots from the four-four
See, I can't do promo, can't do no shows
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload

[Verse 1]
Rapstar, hundred bars in my Fendi bag
I couldn't get a check so I bodied away
Got a kilo on my neck, 'nother nine on deck
Dope boy Troy, what the fuck you expect
Whippin' extra, no extra friends
Young nigga came in the game with a Benz
Shittin' on niggas, shoulda came with Depends
Grippin on niggas, I'ma spray em again
Boomin' shit, roomin' shit
Married to the game, I'm a groom and shit
Carrying a K, all full of shit
And I'm still Indy like a Hoosier bitch
Ballin' out in these Louboutins, I'm like fuck these sneakers
They only cost me an ounce of blow
When my account is low
Put a nigga in your speakers

[Hook]
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em up, numerous shots from the four-four
See, I can't do promo, can't do no shows
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em up, numerous shots from the four-four
See, I can't do promo, can't do no shows
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload

See, I can't do promo, can't do no shows
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload

[Verse 2]
Moving weight, picking up the bag
Where the base I could bust their ass
Fix a plate, than we cut the cash
Eatin' good like succotash
Money still iconic shit
Bean-town, double up Chubby Chubb the fit
So much damn money in these fucking Balmains
Now I swear these shit don't be tryna zip
Still got it on lock
Still got the streets, still got a Glock
Still got my wrist here in the pot
Still makin' whip-whip till it rock
Drug dealin', dream fulfilling, murder killing
Fuck about your feelings
Of a drug dealin', dream fulfilling
I want from zero to a motherfucking million

[Hook]
