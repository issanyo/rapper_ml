[Chorus]
Keep niggas out my loop
I get money, keep a coupe
Ice and cream, so she scoop
Pick up game and I hoop
Niggas mad I ball, I shoot
Handle business with no suit
Blowing heat, don't get sued
(B-b-boom!) word!

Keep niggas out my loop
I get money, keep a coupe
Ice and cream, so she scoop
Pick up game and I hoop
Niggas mad I ball, I shoot
Handle business with no suit
Blowing heat, don't get sued
(B-b-boom!) word!

[Verse 1]
Weak niggas think it's cute
Ridin' dick and climbing gooch
They ain't 100 on ma dukes, nigga word!
I know they be in cahoots
Over my back they gotta boost
I'm 'bout to come back off the stoop, nigga word!
I ain't got no motherfuckin' cares
Judge sittin' in the chair
In his eyes is where I stare at, word!
I'm facin' 20 years a pair that's a 40 listen here
It ain't right and it ain't fair, it's wack, word
So, it's life, but I don't pout a lot
I smile in style Gucci'd down to my socks a lot, word!
Still fuckin' up the parking lot
Exotic cars, matching broads love this chocolate, word!

[Chorus]
Keep niggas out my loop
I get money, keep a coupe
Ice and cream, so she scoop
Pick up game and I hoop
Niggas mad I ball, I shoot
Handle business with no suit
Blowing heat, don't get sued
(B-b-boom!) word!

Keep niggas out my loop
I get money, keep a coupe
Ice and cream, so she scoop
Pick up game and I hoop
Niggas mad I ball, I shoot
Handle business with no suit
Blowing heat, don't get sued
(B-b-boom!) word!

[Verse 2]
Fork in the stove scrapin' the blue
Cookin' the dough's facin' the blues
Like cotton and candy
I'm stackin' the youth
Should the rollies, rock that goop
Good, runnin' them checks in my loops
Good, strawberry, but no shortcake
Money long as my hallway
Mint chip, I eat all day
And the nightmares of no parkay
I'm a millionaire with a court case
I could Tay-K what my flows say
My jewelry costs at least 100 bands in your face
Only rapper owns several homes and the cars that I race
Fuckin' these bitches, gettin' this money
Fuck these niggas, they move funny
How you real, when you be hungry?
You ain't workin', you a dummy
Feet on gummy, stuck on bummy
It's a wrap, boy you a mummy
With your hands out, movin' from me
My shit buzzin', I got honeys talkin' flavors
Asian persuaders, Icy Italians
Butter pecan Ricans, vanillas creamin'
Chocolates be stylin'
Middle East ones love to pray before they get in they throat
My Dominican mixed with rum and make a Brugal float
It's good, word!

[Chorus]
Keep niggas out my loop
I get money, keep a coupe
Ice and cream, so she scoop
Pick up game and I hoop
Niggas mad I ball, I shoot
Handle business with no suit
Blowing heat, don't get sued
(B-b-boom!) word!

Keep niggas out my loop
I get money, keep a coupe
Ice and cream, so she scoop
Pick up game and I hoop
Niggas mad I ball, I shoot
Handle business with no suit
Blowing heat, don't get sued
(B-b-boom!) word!
