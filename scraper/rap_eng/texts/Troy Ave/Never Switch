Don't count on me for favors cause it's getting boring
I go from looking out for 'em to looking for 'em
Keep the pans you niggas can't even touch my hands
I'm doing the MC hammer dance while I'm touching bands
Only ones I'm showing love to is my fans
Just because we are related that don't make you fam
I'm in the game you on the bench riding all that wood
Niggas want me dead or worse broke in the hood

[Outro]
Ay, all you niggas coming round me I'm starting you off on fucking 0. I used to start niggas off wit 100 but now I got no faith in them. They don't make no sense, they always let you the fuck down. Niggas do not be 100. They don't even be 85
I be like "Ay nigga you short, go get the rest"
Mo'fuckers always looking for a handout
But the new shit the way they front
Be like "I ain't looking for no handout I'm looking to work for mine whatever you got, put me on"
Nigga that's a motherfucking handout
I need help nigga, matter of fact I need help helping myself
You go from looking out for a nigga to now you got to look for 'em
You give a nigga some shit
"Yo remember that shit I gave you?
"Ite cool"
"You ready for me to come pick that up?"
"Yeah baby come through I got that no problem"
You get there nigga give you all type of story
Yeah you know I had to go here and then you know I had to pay this and then you know I had a little bitch the other night
Man I'm not fronting these fronting ass niggas, no more
