You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Outside I gotta tec, inside I gotta snub
I wrote correct, act wrong and get a slug
I see that you into money, well baby then show me love
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Outside I gotta tec, inside I gotta snug
I wrote correct, act wrong and get a slug
I see that you and the money, well baby then show me love
You can find me in the club

[Verse 1]
Jewelry all rocky, you know how I be
Told you mo'fuckas' is in the hood I'm "Papi"
I got all type of fish, Peruvian "ahi" I got all type of bitches
But I'm choosing ain't cocky, see me on the couch
See me pouring out, see me on your TV when you're sitting in your house
I'm on BET, MTV man I'm the hottest thing smokin' outta NYC
Self made and self paid, niggas can't stop me
I hand out, your hands out like save me a peach
Man fuck you spit Crystal in your face, you can hate me now and tell how success tastes
Not bad don't it, mad want it, nigga please I bought the bar you at the bar
You should leave go DJ, play that new Troy Ave shit
Two steppin' with my weapon B-S be that clip

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Spend some G's on some Givenchy and bon weed
My bitch in Brazilian hair that bon weave
Her pussy be the bomb it's kamikaze
Touch the sky and do why I'm on floor 93
Condos in Paris above Versages, and we party in the club VIP
We do it BIG, a hundred bottles on an Arabian seat
Prince'd buy a ring with some hashish, then it's back to the NY streets
South side hood party with some projects freaks
You some Baisley bitches, or some 40 bitches, or some Rochdale bitches
Or some Sutphin bitches, call straight club king just promoting the night
La morena grippin', two white girls kissin'
The city never sleep, you bitch I hope you don't miss it, don't blame it on me homie we out here pimpin'

[Hook]

You can find me in the club
You can find me in the club
You can find me in the club
You can find me in the club
