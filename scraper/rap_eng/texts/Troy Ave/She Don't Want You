She don't want

A bum nigga so I come kick it with her
Show her how life could be if we together
This is no manogamie, I'm not a cover
I just want the best for me, and if you loyal then you too baby, you so crazy
I show you my love, I give you that Mercedes
She show me her joy if I gridn it out on the daily
We make power moves, that shit hit we not to play with
She's so dangerous, was she angry?
Thick coat on my body that give me a little flavor
In my jeans I'm usin' it just to savor
You should have one too but she don't want you
She don't want you
She don't want you
She don't want you, no no no
She don't want you, no no no
She don't want you, you got no dough
She don't want you

What she want? She want a real nigga
She want a kid with the bricks who can deal with her
Hot dope bouy Troy I'm gettin' real figures
Eatin' good and I'm on my third meal nigga
And I know, I know, you laugh
I got your girl, and it's too bad, and she's too bad, and we too fast
Beep the horn and we blew straight past (vroom)
Six fingers to the lanes
Tiffany's through the flames
I can see she belong to the game
When she with me I let her do her thang
Diamond shinin' bright, no I'm not polite, I be smackin and chokin' that bitch
She's the freak in tight, ooh the kind that likes, and boy you better give her that dick
Take, it take it
Let me give it to you girl you'll take it
I can't do nothin' with it at all girl, let me take it
She want me, she don't want you, she want me
I can see she belong to the game
But when she with me I let her do her thang
Ay, ay
She don't want you
She want diamonds thats blue
Ooh
, I see through
Ooh, aw

Steady vibe nigga word
