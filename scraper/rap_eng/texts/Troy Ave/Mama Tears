[Hook]
The dope game hard, the rap game easy
Industry niggas so motherfucking sleazy
In the streets niggas gon try you if it's easy
Leave you like a bitch on a period bleeding
Real respect real almost in any case
When the fake get involved it turn to a murder case

[Verse 1]
Behind every death, it's a sucker in the mix
Sucker niggas get a real nigga in some deep shit
For instance Glenn, did business with Ben
Glenn told him get a chick I gotta check for ten
Would hit shorty with two, if she clear in a week
Then it's eight bands left we split four grand a piece
Long story long Glenn jerked him instead
Fucked the bitch and count up and withdrew all of the bread
Ben caught him slipping put the slammy to his head
Took his jewels, took it to the pawn, shit was just lead
Faker than the three dollar bill, he wish he killed
Glenn sped back to his block right up the hill
Told the OG Butter from the hood what happened
But he left out the part, 'bout him snaking and ratting
Said I was just chilling on Rutland, 'bout to kick it with a bitch
Then this hating nigga Ben, ran up on me with some shit
I told the nigga if he gon pull it, then he better kill me!
Butter said what happened? Nigga took all your jewelry?
Nah I ain't wear it today, I kept it light
That nigga can't shoot anyway, so I'm aight
But he fucked up now, cause I know where he be
Matter fact big homey, won't you ride with me?
Now Butter in the car, he don't play that shit
And he fitting to put a hole in a nigga
With his four fifth eight shot head trigger
There he go right there, pull up a lil' nearer
Imma get out, meet me on the corner, stay on the right
Glenn said cool big homey, I got you aight
Ben ain't even seen it coming he caught that body with ease
When Glenn saw some people coming he thought it was the D's
But it wasn't, and he drove off
Butter hit the corner lookin like is this boy lost?
Now it's sirens, gun in hand looking violent
He fit the description, police just got the firing, now he gone
And the moral of the story is, fucking with suckers could get your mother tears
And the moral of the story is, when you fuck with them suckers it get your mother tears
This is my song, you can't defend wrong
You can't defend wrong, Maybe you'll listen if I put it in a song, song, song, song
Maybe you'll listen if I put it in a song, song, song, song, you can't defend wrong

[Hook]
The dope game hard, the rap game easy
Industry niggas so motherfucking sleazy
In the streets niggas gon try you if it's easy
Leave you like a bitch on a period bleeding
Real respect real almost in any case
When the fake get involved it turn to a murder case
