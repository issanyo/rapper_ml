Niggas movin' strange
Married to the game
Feelin' kinda... dopeboy Trillin' kinda

[Hook]
Married to the game
Where my diamond rings at?
Cookin' cocain, trappin' at a bang house
Niggas movin' strange, saw 'em pull their things out
I don't play with fuck niggas, we gon' have a bang out
Married to the game

[Verse 1]
Maserati T, drippin' like a Sosa
Unidentifly, this niggas is salsa
Used to be a time you play with me, I just fought ya
And I got the cheat codes, sh-sh-slaughter
Haters lookin' at my instagram, it be torture
See me with a lotta Benjamins, I'm a baller
See me with a chick I took from him, and he called her askin' questions like he writin' a fuckin' book but ain't no author!

[Verse 2]
Dope boy Troy got hisself, got a rock
Makin' moves in shoes with the matching $100 socks
Gucci Lucci's what I got, hatas don't want me with guac they want me stopped they want me dropped
But I did it, see the top? Spend and plot
B-b-b-boom, rip the aves
I just stained somethin', the police on my tail I'm hittin' the cops
Real nigga timin' they don't got shit to do with a watch
I provide for my family and pray a lot
