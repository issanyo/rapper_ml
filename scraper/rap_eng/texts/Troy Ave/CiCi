(Intro)
Shorty lethal, but I love it
When I hit her with the (deeny?) I do not glove it

(Chorus)
I’m in love with a girl named CiCi
She a pretty little thang and she freaky
She the baddest little hoe in the tepee
When she down or her knees then she please me
She go ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Open wide bitch
She go ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
That is my bitch

(Verse 1)
(No room?) on my bench, she a bad little mama
I’ma buy ma, wear’n Dulce & Gabbana
Forty on me too, forty worth of blue
Stones with the watch in my earrings wooo!
Cold man, my government name Roland
Met a white girl on LSD she was roll’n
I said that to say that my mind all crazy
The simile in that? I be shine’n all crazy
Bling, bling, bling
I was locked in the bing, clink, clink
I’m buy’n CiCi a ring, ring, cha-ching
I’m married to the streets but the money ain’t a thing, mothafuck!

(Chorus)
I’m in love with a girl named Cici
She a pretty little thang and she freaky
She the baddest little hoe in the teepee
When she down or her knees then she please me
She go ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Open wide bitch
She go ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
That is my bitch

(Verse 2)
Trump say’n make America great again
Troy Ave (same bacon boy to whip weight again?)
My birthday passed now I’m get’n cake again
I’m count’n up say’n ‘are they hate’n, again?’
Why? It don’t affect me
A dope dark-skinned dealer like Wesley
New Jack City, but I’m on a jet ski
I’m that nigga if you try’n to assess me

(Chorus)
I’m in love with a girl named CiCi
She a pretty little thang and she freaky
She the baddest little hoe in the teepee
When she down or her knees then she please me
She go ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Open wide bitch
She go ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
That is my bitch
(Open wide bitch)
(That is my bitch)
(Open wide bitch)
(That is my bitch)
