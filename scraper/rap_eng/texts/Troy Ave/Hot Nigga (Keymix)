[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Dope boy, Troy Ave, young hot nigga
You see me, you see the apple, I am Motts nigga
Different sauce, see me floss, red drop nigga
16 in the mag, one in top nigga
Murder ain’t a thang but a hip reach
Money ain't a thang but a quick meet
Fast life living, dicking dip freaks
BSB records, we the new street
Still watch it, I ain’t quote Jigga
Shabazz [?] 300, Wade switched the figures
Shouts to GS9, BK niggas
I love my cities shine, you see the way I glitter
VVS, my [?] neck in my hands
Major deal advance sitting in my pants
Pockets so heavy I just take a stance
Two stepping, let my diamonds do the Shmoney dance
[?], honor roll, hustlers relate
Count a quarter mil, making sure the numbers straight
187s hit, keep the 848
I give a niggga the chills just like my Rolex face
No ticks but some hating suckers
Sitting in the nosebleeds yelling shit, fuck it
Free John, free Rum, free J O
Can’t forget killer out there, all them niggas yayo
Caught a body 20 weeks ago
A day off, but them people know
My gun warm I will heat the four
But let me get back to this kitchen, whipping, eating blow

[Verse 2: Young Lito]
Young Lito, I'm a love nigga
Well known shooter and a puff flipper
Straight G you can see it in my eyes nigga
I took bands, bitches, and a couples lives nigga
Ballin' like Jordan, these niggas Byron Russel
Biting my swag, these niggas need a muzzle
LV's homie, all over my duffle
If you need you some shooters, I'll send you a couple
Had that little gangster in you oozing out
You know me, one call would have them uzis out
Run up on your block with them toolies out
Dropping clips you would think we had a movie out
It ain't a game I run up on him like he 40 Glocc
He say the wrong thing then you gon' hear my 40 pop
Or I can throw a bag on him like a dirty cop
I call [?] you know that body drop
Sometimes I be feeling like I'm Max Payne
The fresh tool, you know he love to hear that mac ring
I been tryna chill for the rap game
But if this shit fail, niggas getting clapped mane
Feds got 8, Rick and Geno got 30
And they told me they gon' wear it like a fucking jersey
We don't ride on my side we stand up and [?]
With 4's locked on my side, we do them niggas dirty
If he with his homie, we gon' hit his mans too
[?] will squeeze it at his head like it's shampoo
[?] quick to smoke a nigga like some bamboo
Leave his brains out like some toes in the sandles
Ill

[Outro: Troy Ave]
Once she give me head kick her ass out
Rubber band the money, smoking ash out
Open up the [?] bring the glass out
First of the month you know what that's 'bout
BSB
AVE
NYC
Yea that's me
