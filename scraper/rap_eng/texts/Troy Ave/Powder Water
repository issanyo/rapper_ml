[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
I’m sipping Cristal now you can hate me
Chicks never say nahs, yeahs and maybes
I’m a bad boy but i'm with your baby
Roll up in Mercedes
Two front seats no back, no tops
Flippin’ and whippin’ either way I get the drop
Pick up the spliff and pick up your face with a shot
Handle my business and celebrate it with a shot
Two or three
Yeah I’m in the zone
I like to mix rose mo’ with ma Patron
The only life I know put that in a song
So take two birds forty in June
Price high
Out of town life by
Living amongst lions notice I ain’t die
Powder

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E]
Got your bitch on my bike, crack addict
Saw me cooking eggs and thought I was back at it
Arm n’ Hammer
Ma niggas still hood
Whip it real good
Whip, whip it real good
Plenty keys, drug dealer green
Good belt always hang from my denim jeans
I get thrills when I ride on my enemies
It was real when they caught me in the Phillipines
Yeah… you found Noreaga
Shittin like a mule
With them 40 acres
Papi a vet ain’t no little grams
I’m the connect so fuck the little mans
I speak about it, I got my money up
Every week me and Hass in Columbia
Yeah… so what you think they call me Papi for
Even when i pop chicks raw I’ve been selling raw

[Verse 3: Sho Ballotti]
They ain't seen a wave like this since the 80s
You done fell in love with a crook now baby
Imma buss that thing open like yo ass doing yoga
Ice on my chain got my neck going polar
Living life
So why you giving the cold shoulder
Good belt gang that thing cost 12 hundred
Belt buckle big H [?]
Fucked up a few credit cards that ain’t nothing
Cause my credit score in the hood is 800
So if rap don’t work for me I just call my pluggie
He hit me on the arm like he seen a punch buggie
Go to the spot to cop your shit
My plug says meet me at the dock… bring a forklift
Pause for the feds man I’m off this
At the fortress… with your bitch
She gorgeous but attitude is all swordfish
Type a bitch never in a good mood
So after I fuck her I try to convince her that you’s a good dude
Pardon’ me
That was kind of rude
Party at the crib and shorty ya’ll come thru
You and yo’ best friend yeah bring her too
Maybe later on show me how that thing move
5-7 bitch, know the gang, know the crew
