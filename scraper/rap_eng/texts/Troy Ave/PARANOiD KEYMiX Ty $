[Intro]
Powder the god

Troy Ave BSB

See me shine


[Hook]

You ain't buying liquor in the club
But you right in my section putting your cup in
You bum ass nigga get the fuck from us
You taking up space, make room for the hoes
Too many bros make room for the hoes

[Verse 1]

I'm looking good but I'm feeling aggy
Broke niggas coming to harass me
If it ain't about money don't say shit
If you a fan I'm showing love thats Basic
You ain't buy my album but you trying to hang with, (who)
Me and my people that I came with (not you)
Dick riders be the type I don't bang with
Smack you in the face take your chain quick
Go the fuck on, let the babes over
Take your bitch from you tell her "dates over"
She looking at me like he doing it up (I'm doing my thing)
She's looking at you like is it cool if I fuck? (and now she doing my thing)

[hook]
You ain't buying liquor in the club
But you right in my section putting your cup in
You bum ass nigga get the fuck from us
You taking up space, make room for the hoes
Too many bros make room for the hoes

[Verse 2]
V.I.P. me and BSB know the motto
Get money, get bitches, give niggas hollows
Could have shot a movie called "poppin" we did not though
You ask me for a drink while I'm sipping out the bottle? (what?)
Fuck is on your mind nigga you a men kisser?
You know we in the club right? you know they sell liquor?
You the type to want to play the couch looking chill
And then be looking in your phone when they come with the bill
Gold diggers looking for a come up or source
But when they digging me they just come up short (aha)
Accept for the long stroke, fur for my long coat
Broadway Joe playing with the green off coat
Put myself on, for my city I put on though
I am that nigga all these other niggas false hopes (powderrr)
Hottest in the streets and they know it, I don't run from it I relish in the moment

[Hook]
You ain't buying liquor in the club
But you right in my section putting your cup in
You bum ass nigga get the fuck from us
You taking up space, make room for the hoes
Too many bros make room for the hoes

[outro]
Make room for the hoes
I ain't come to the club to be in the million man march
You ain't got enough lace on your panties to stand around me
All in the VIP, You ain't even busting it up
Ay B$B Volume 4 Comin soon
Make room for that too
You know we drop classic shit every trip
