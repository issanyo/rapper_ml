Dope Boy Troy!

(Hook)
I pull up she gotta choose so you know what she hoppin'
Couple likes and way more views so you know that they watchin'
Hundred thousand worth in jewels, so you know that they clockin'
I got haters, I got haters so you know that they poppin'
I pull up she gotta choose so you know what she hoppin'
Couple likes and way more views so I know that they watchin'
Hundred thousand for my jewels, so you know that they clockin'
I got haters, I got haters so you know that they poppin'

(Verse 1)
I got VVS stones on my neck I'm a hustler
I got VVS stones on the neck of my brother
I just bought a big home eating good like the supper
Niggas praying on my downfall pretend that they suffer
All this flossin' hurt they heart shit, I am heartless
I killed most my enemies and I walked free of charges
Nigga don't stand next to me if you scared to be a target
Niggas may run down on me but it's gon' be a hard hit

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
I like to fuck a bad bitch until they pussy be squirtin'
I like 'em suckin' mad dick until they feelings be hurtin'
I love to count up mad money until my thumbs hurt too
I know Im'a have arthrtitis niggas how about you?
God blessed me ah choo! My diamonds cold and they blue
I'm getting all that I'm due, look at the shit I been through
First class I flew, down in Miami today
Out of jail, and on bail for lettin' that semi spray

(Hook)
