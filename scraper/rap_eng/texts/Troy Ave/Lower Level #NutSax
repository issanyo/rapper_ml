[Intro]
Oh you talking out of term
I think we are all talking together
I normally don’t do interview with woman
Unless I’m fornicating with them
So you shouldn't talk any more
You see it’s back and forth in this mother fucker
I’m making my way to the top
Stealing my swag
I don’t give no credit we just cashing out
We don’t use credit you heard
Got it got it
V8 driving he’s he stay flying
You know got this on sumo  balling like Juco
Dope boy troy the hottest nigga out of New York
City mother fucker is still crazy mother fucker
Not a tight pants wanting to be pretty mother fucker
Fuck her i just wanted to be rich got all my grizzy With my butter
Breaking down the grizzy ten times with the cutter
Ten dimes one each than eating with each other
The fenes don’t suffer with i
I do it over I fuck who ever judge
But i do this to survive i guess I’m the fittest cause
I get the work out then i murk out
Somewhere freeway so I got nothing to worry about
Except these bitches I’m a fuck and I forget my toothbrush
And the kicks that goes with these cloths damn i hate to rush
Gave me a rush counting a quarter million in twenties
That’s why I made a song called all about the money
And I’m all about God I’m religious but I don’t follow
The commandments who wrote all them shit was suspicious
Thou shall not kill but i kill the crack game
My uncle says it’s in my jeans I’m not talking about Balmain
Put niggers in a box and don’t fuck yoy mien
My eyes have been chinese before I smoked the loud mien
Damn I’m higher than a mug
And i ask myself a question how much longer i can a dud
I don’t think I’m for the society
Said that i was or mase I mean man
If I don’t then I’m damned if i do I’m the man
It doesn't really don’t matter
In a book of life they don’t have a seventh chapter
Think about it the depression built niggers and broke bitches
Hardly ever leads to more figures
Just smoke snitches because they jealous or afraod
It’s more roses for your graves
I’m on a whole nother level writing lines with a shovel
I’m so underground I get beats from the devil
Or chasing cash cause I’m chasing pedal fast
I would drive around a BMX bike to the bag
I’m on a whole other level i write rhymes with the shovel
I’m so underground I get beats from the devil
Or chasing cash cause I’m chasing pedal fast
I would drive around a BMX bike to the bag
I heard i couldn't count a hood when i was back home i
Had to buy another crib that would be three i own
My new album december 4th I’m back in my zone
Put your head by my body for my dick sucker like Sax Phone
Twitter fingers how many times you going to tweeting
I’m always on the flyers i guess you always to afraid to meet me
And it starts with my nose and my ears and wrist
If you tough i dare you take it
And use this cheque I’m calling you out
But you only answer to Instagramming
What do we expect from a low level scandal
And facts you just gossip girl
No sex you need to stop it girl
You been wagging for bozos to a board
Alligator watchman in the eyes of the Lord
And the eyes on me I get money
I made a million while you made jokes
Now that’s funny ha ha ha
Ha ha ha six figures for my car
Drop a taxi to a boy and look how far you are
Goddamn i can’t thought you just came to hate
I came to motivate and who is really real and who’s fake
It’s really hit me two hundred times
In my matrix and its all for these hoes
And it’s all for attention
You just want to be invited to chill and just take pictures
Damn girl you are more bitch that these bitches
When you thought medium when the door hit the border
I represent the street if your are in it you are for sure
Avenue mad revenue farm passing through
Is my world sex or you just a squirrel on my casuals
Enough hunger rap pa lacking on the group
We gangster through the phone with real nigga persauna
Cash beat you up in jail that was the end
You beat up a chick went back to jail
That was if i ever for aile Emma with aile
I’m laughing to the bank it's got this punk checking the mail
Word  uh I’m the rich nigga what the fuck are you
You is a bitch nigga what you going to do
Not a thing in life that you all can connect
And the most you might go to the internet
With thurs moving it’s all about if it's gangster
A pussy chump for a page
Hashtag nut sack
I’m on a whole other level i write rhymes with the shovel
I’m so underground I get beats from the devil
Or chasing cash cause I’m chasing pedal fast
I would drive around a BMX bike to the bag
I’m on a whole other level i write rhymes with the shovel
I’m so underground I get beats from the devil
Or chasing cash cause I’m chasing pedal fast
I would drive around a BMX bike to the bag nigga
