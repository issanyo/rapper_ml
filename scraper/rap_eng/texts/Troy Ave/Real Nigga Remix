[Chorus]
I made my name up in these streets like a real nigga
I keep them pistols in my Jeep like a real nigga
I make sure all my homies eat like a real nigga
I fuck your bitch and go to sleep like a real nigga
Man, all my pockets be obese cause I deal, nigga
A couple boxes, ain't no sneaks, just some bills, nigga
The way I handle all my beefs, I just kill niggas
If you one hundred, then you love me, I'm a real nigga

[Verse 1]
Studio thug, you can't do what I does
I am really a Plug, you just cool in 'em clubs
Before this rap, I had buzz, feds watchin this shit
They jammed a D on the road, he ain't cooperate shit
I hold him down with that cash for being real like I knew
Loyalty ain't no favor, nigga, it's just what we do
BSB is the crew, we get wild like a zoo
But often time we like chillin, fuckin' wit' hoes by the two
Man, it's nothin, all these bitches is fuckin'
All these niggas are frontin, I see 'em, they owing nothing
I smack, shoot or snuff 'em, they don't respect my name
Violence my goto move, I make 'em respect the pain, motherfuckers

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Ain’t got a deal but my whip went half a mil nigga
Call me Bill Gates,yo bitch ain’t half a pill nigga
She said all she ever wanted was a real nigga
Got a bust down Rollie and I’m playing with her
Got that 45 homie and I’m drinking ‘Zurp
Move momma out the hood to the suburbs
Momma ain’t gotta work cause her son got the work
Fuck what you heard real niggas come first
I fucked your bitch and put her out like a real nigga
Million dollar nigga but the streets are still in em
Ya’ll can have em bitches homie we been ran through it
Everybody always ask me how I do it

[Chorus]
I made my name up in these streets like a real nigga
I keep them pistols in my Jeep like a real nigga
I make sure all my homies eat like a real nigga
I fuck your bitch and go to sleep like a real nigga
Man, all my pockets be obese cause I deal, nigga
A couple boxes, ain't no sneaks, just some bills, nigga
The way I handle all my beefs, I just kill niggas
If you one hundred, then you love me, I'm a real nigga

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Real nigga A-1 I can remember, I remember that shit
Bankrolling my stack helping my family, getting rid o that shit
Go up down that highway with that package, yeah we rolling
Got the whole thing drip drip shooting like Magic
Free my nigga BG, free my nigga (free em)
And my nigga Meech and my nigga Peewi (Bankroll Mafia)
RIght here in the ride with me
Where yo bitch at?
You pack a punch come and talk
I’m  nigga baddy baddy, we talk about it
All this work nobody talks about it
Go figure, I’d rather be a bad nigga than a broke nigga
Cheers to the many men that we used to be coke dealers

[Chorus]
I made my name up in these streets like a real nigga
I keep them pistols in my Jeep like a real nigga
I make sure all my homies eat like a real nigga
I fuck your bitch and go to sleep like a real nigga
Man, all my pockets be obese cause I deal, nigga
A couple boxes, ain't no sneaks, just some bills, nigga
The way I handle all my beefs, I just kill niggas
If you one hundred, then you love me, I'm a real nigga

[Verse 4: Neef Bucks]
Yo I’m a ten hunnid gunna, a BSB stunna
I hit yo girl up I wanna, when I’m done I’m a pun her
I used to ball err summer but now I ball errday
I ain’t shooting no jumpers, I’m shooting niggas that play
Look wherever I lay I got the brick in my pocket
They see that I’m living and they just dying to stop it
But I’m here, I don’t care and I’m flyer than a layer
Nigga with an attitude with ice cubes in my ear
Haters look with attitude but run up on me they don’t dare
All it take is two bands to make them niggas disappear
Like magic, nigga I’m a savage
I don’t do drugs but for money I’m an addict

[Chorus]
I made my name up in these streets like a real nigga
I keep them pistols in my Jeep like a real nigga
I make sure all my homies eat like a real nigga
I fuck your bitch and go to sleep like a real nigga
Man, all my pockets be obese cause I deal, nigga
A couple boxes, ain't no sneaks, just some bills, nigga
The way I handle all my beefs, I just kill niggas
If you one hundred, then you love me, I'm a real nigga
