If you ain't getting money, you ain't gonna feel it

(Verse 1)
I understand why these pussy niggas hate
Cause this a Valentino camo not a bape
Ain’t take no hand outs went and got my own plate
They ain’t real like me so they can’t relate
I bought a Bentley truck coulda bought a wraith
I took it back cause it had to much space
I’m a coupe nigga baby roll the tape
Red Maserati
Now Ferrari’s how I skate
Gettin my roll on I got a Rollie on
My housekeeper say Buenos Dias Mr Roland
I sip peppermint tea with a Versace robe on
I got the treasure nigga you jus gettin ya troll on

(Chorus)
My lil bitch is Mexican her daddy is the Plug
B4 I was rappin I was trappin wrapping weighing drugs
Street niggas turn to Dick eaters off a buzz
A real nigga can’t do nothing wit no phony love
I heard the whole industry got me black balled
Well they could suck my dick and lick my black balls
I’m still young rich and Black
See me ball
Standing on my own two while most these niggas crawl
I Done came up
I Done came up
I done came up
I done came up
I Done came up
I Done came up
Seen niggas change up
I got my aim up

Verse 2:
Yo I thought that was ya man
Shit I thought he was too
Now all I think about is money and how my bank account grew
I use to think about a million
Then I made me a few
I use to think I needed Niggas
Now it’s Fuck them too
And it’s simple as that
That’s a Fendi fact
This a Fendi headband
This ain’t no Fendi cap
She call her pussy wet land
I always wear a hat
I ain't make it out the trap
Just to get entrapped
Can’t get no baby but baby you get it from the back
I toss that bitch a couple hundred I'ma get it back
For every 1/2 a band I gave her she made me a rack
These bitches realer than most niggas
No debating that
Gimmie ya loyalty
I’m giving u royalty
She giving the breakdown
Like girl he be spoiling me
He be dripped down
Even his toiletry
He dropped 6 figures
Just for he his lawyer fees

(Chorus)
My lil bitch is Mexican her daddy is the Plug
B4 I was rappin I was trappin wrapping weighing drugs
Street niggas turn to Dick eaters off a buzz
A real nigga can’t do nothing wit no phony love
I heard the whole industry got me black balled
Well they could suck my dick and lick my black balls
I’m still young rich and Black
See me ball
Standing on my own two while most these niggas crawl
I Done came up
I Done came up
I done came up
I done came up
I Done came up
I Done came up
Seen niggas change up
I got my aim up
