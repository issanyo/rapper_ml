[Intro: Troy Ave]
Had to turn the levels down a lil' bit

BSB
P. Reign what up my G

[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Troy Ave young boss
I'm on another level like Mars
See me up like the stars
I got a spaceship for upcall
6 Series Bimmer, it's not mine but fuck it it's my dawgs
I rap [?] when I floss but when I'm on the crib with these hoes
I'mma make a call, get a car for my man
A nigga ride and drop [?]
Pull up to the spot, put her hand in my pants
She pull a nigga cock put her head in my [?]
[?]
I made most of my money off crack
I ain't gossip, I'm just stating facts
I got that Dolce&Gabbana [?]
9mm ciggy, she finna teed up her name Tiggy
Okay I changed her name to "be discret"
Her name really Chanel and she sneaky
She in with yo boy when the man ain't home
He hittin' the girl like : Where she goin'?
Bitch [?] act to a bestfriend phone
[?] and don't

[Hook: Troy Ave & P. Reign]
I be sub-stabbing in my Coogi
Killers and commas lucci
Won't let her hope it seduce me
Me and my dawgs we salugi
Take her for some fun in the 6
She just wanna come with the clique
Told Gucci pull in the whip
Nigga I got guns in this bitch

[Verse 2: P. Reign]
Talk to me, talk to me
Take the leash off your bitch, tell her walk to me
Big dawg man these puppies can't bark with me
Cheat the club like Atlanta brought the hoax with me
Imma bless you know I keep dawg with me
Still a lot of nigga [?] the shark with me
Got your shawty at the window yellin' "Run Ricky"
And fuck it if I get caught Imma call Drizzy
I'm the nigga to see, I still get it for cheap
From like a year ago with me [?] yellin free [?]
Never mention my name, never mention my team
Or your head on the curb, make you swallow your teeth
Nigga pull up and see, it ain't nothin' to beef
Know we got expensive tastes but the bullets are cheap
Imma do this one for Yams, [?]
She want a young wavy nigga made her swallow to see

[Hook: Troy Ave & P. Reign]
I be sub-stabbing in my Coogi
Killers and commas and lucci
Won't let her hope it seduce me
Me and my dawgs we salugi
Take her for some fun in the 6
She just wanna come with the clique
Told Gucci pull in the whip
Nigga I got guns in this bitch

[Verse 3: Troy Ave & P. Reign]
MMC
Money Murder Crew
It's a proven fact and we'll murder you, hypothetically speaking
I'm going to jail if the police [?]
Into my past niggas I done pass
Tell to my lawyer I beat it with cash
Off cookin' up mash, potato [?]
Swear to God, I thought I was gon get the 8080
Me, a nigga so blessed, I ain't riding a GSL
I came from the bottom now a nigga doin' damn well
Lately at the top, pay me you'll get pot
Used to work on the block now I'm watchin' the stock
I can handle the rock like I handle the Glock
Okay come see I'm [?] with the shot
Shout out my nigga cause you know that's my nigga
If I tell you I love you, girl you know it's the liquor
Only answer for money so if you're callin' me nigga
Then you better say "Cheese" like you pose for the picture (Woah)
