I'd like to pray for those under the sound of my voice. In the name of Jesus, help us surrender our hearts to you and our souls to you, because you're reaching for us to bring us to a place of safety. I ask you Lord God let your love rescue us from the dangers of our hearts and our minds, the dangers of society and this world, and bring us to a place of safety. Thank you for the second chance you've given us to build our lives in a greater capacity so that we can in turn help others get to a place of safety. Use our lives from this day forward to be a place of refuge, to connect those that are in danger, and bring them to the safety of your spirit. In Jesus' name, amen
