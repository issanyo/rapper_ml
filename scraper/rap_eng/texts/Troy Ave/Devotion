(Hook)
On the road to life trying to see where I get
In my rearview mirror leaving all bullshit
Coming from nothing, on my way to be something
Keep it real with the real, that's why the fakes say I'm frontin'
I don't care if they hate me they did nothing to make me
I'm riding Mercedes it's driving 'em crazy
That came out in the picture excuses won't fix ya
But all the ones that supporting just know that I'm with ya!
You should know that I'm with ya!
Just know that I'm with ya, just know that I'm with ya
And if the role reversed I know you got me the same!

(Verse 1)
With the niggas that I would go for and kick in the door for
I love my dogs like they touchdown or robo
That's my son and problem got 'em covered like brothers
Me and Lito closer than me and my father
He was kind of around, I would drive out of town
Me and Hovain selling cocaine from paper brown
Bags of money out the bag it smell funny
Rubber bands on rubber bands on mostly 20's
Fish scale got me on another scale, oily
Pace protect your faith and most your loyalty
I done seen niggas pump up and pump fake
Over flake I stayed true celebrate, we got cake!

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
Two of my favorite girls, they give me a headache
I just give 'em the world
I'm talking about my mother and my baby mother
The only girls that make me ever play a sucker
Paid off my mama crib it's worth over a million
I told her rent it out and leave she like nigga I'm chilling
Bought my BM a rover just to control her wishes
She got the nerve to complain I'm fucking too much bitches
Listen you can stay and you can go
When you ready to leave them doors
She can leave them hoes for good
You out the hood we understood we good
We understood we out the hood I did us good, word!

(Hook)

(Verse 3)
To the fans we go in together get it from selling grams rely on me if ever
I'm a little abrasive but like the love that you show
But I ain't used to people speaking to me I don't know
Fuck it, still do it Im'a get used to it
Im'a get you revealed by the ones you put on my music
They gone come back like I thought you was liar
But yo man Troy Ave you was right he got fire
Download or purchase, YouTube or stream
I just wanna say thank you and I really mean it
They said I wouldn't be shit but a drug dealer from Brooklyn
Now I be having sold out shows they had me mistooken!
