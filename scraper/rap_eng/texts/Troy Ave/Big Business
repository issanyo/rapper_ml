[Intro]
Oh no these niggers were getting illegitimate
These niggers ain’t getting legitimate money
They been getting drug money
These niggers buying empaula
That was like buying the fucking empire state building
You feelin me
Ya we all ain’t playing with the mix out here man
But with me I’m cool the block ain’t playing so we

[Chorus]
Caught a million dollar 50 rubber bands
If you ain’t in the money getting game then you won’t understand
Petty mother fucker I got different plans
I been about my business since I been a man
More money more problems i don’t like the stress
More money more problems i don’t like the stress
More money more problems i don’t fight the stress
RIP to Bigger homie he set it best

[Verse 1]
Been here out in the streets and I’m a mother fucking hero
Started running with these king like Nelly Shakero
Speaking of froze when I’m out baby MIA
Pussy niggers know better to leave me with a widow
Playing both sides you don't think we know about it
Until you broke and die niggers going to know about it
Cold case 5 cold crystal giving pain sipping pain is the kissed off

[Chorus]
Caught a million dollar 50 rubber bands
If you ain’t in the money getting game then you won’t understand
Petty mother fucker I got different plans
I been about my business since I been a man
More money more problems i don’t like the stress
More money more problems i don’t like the stress
More money more problems i don’t fight the stress
RIP to Bigger homie he set it best

[Verse 2]
I was set under the fire laughing in the face of doubt
If you ain’t got enough money then fingers count me out
I heard haters suppose to do me something all they do is bounce
They don’t do it in my presence because they know what I’m about
Troy ain’t smoking I ain’t talking about no weed
Bsb niggers we a whole nother weed
Try to bury us they never know we we ceased
Growing from the concrete hoping the crack you will see nigga

[Chorus]
Caught a million dollar 50 rubber bands
If you ain’t in the money getting game then you won’t understand
Petty mother fucker I got different plans
I been about my business since I been a man
More money more problems i don’t like the stress
More money more problems i don’t like the stress
More money more problems i don’t fight the stress
RIP to Bigger homie he set it best

[Verse 3]
Over green if red black gage do pussy
Put them on back page
About the law what the fuck they expecting me for
Money a valley do disrespecting George
I get them amps and believe I’m every with every G
I keep them K’s and your girls can get the D
You want to get  money you need to get with me mr fleek
I got more gold chain than mr T
Summer time chillin on the stew
Fire hydrant on feed cleaning up the coop
But I caught a milion dollars 50 dollars bill
Angry on the pinky hundred on the other hand man

[Chorus]
Caught a million dollar 50 rubber bands
If you ain’t in the money getting game then you won’t understand
Petty mother fucker I got different plans
I been about my business since I been a man
More money more problems i don’t like the stress
More money more problems i don’t like the stress
More money more problems i don’t fight the stress
RIP to Bigger homie he set it best
