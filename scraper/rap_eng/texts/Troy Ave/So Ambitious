[Hook:]
I'm so ambitious
I want me a Ferrari, but I'm driving a Benz
But how you're gonna get it, well that depends
I be selling dope with my friends
All this rap shit when that begins!
I'm so ambitious
I want me a Ferrari, but I'm driving a Benz
But how you're gonna get it, well that depends
I be selling dope with my friends
All this rap shit when that begins!
I'm so ambitious
Pretty eyes hoes got me so ambitious
Diamonds with the gold got me so ambitious
Tried to get more 'cause I'm so ambitious
I'm so ambitious!
I'm so ambitious!

[Verse 1:]
I went from a truck to a Benzo
Pirellis on the wheel is turning bitch to a nympho
Street life got my time feeling like it's wrong
You in the street's watching, you ain't come to see them all
The soul's being sane and the joy and the pain
Add the money with the murders and you got the drug game
I'm steady moving cane, like "oh, that's me!"
But I'm the young nigga balling, no, you can't see me!
I'm so ambitious, bricks in my backpack
Classic shit just had to do that
And give niggas the business, Dale Jones
Cold price every day on three different cellphones
Each and it's well known the lady shit
Holler at your boy, good price on the sniff
Great price on the wet
The one about the kitchen
I want me a Ferrari, Spider addition!

[Hook:]
I'm so ambitious
I want me a Ferrari, but I'm driving a Benz
But how you're gonna get it, well that depends
I be selling dope with my friends

I'm so ambitious
I want me a Ferrari, but I'm driving a Benz
But how you're gonna get it, well that depends
I be selling dope with my friends
All this rap shit when that begins!
I'm so ambitious
Pretty eyes hoes got me so ambitious
Diamonds with the gold got me so ambitious
Tried to get more 'cause I'm so ambitious
I'm so ambitious!
I'm so ambitious!

[Verse 2:]
East Coast record with the West Coast feel nigga
I'm on the East Coast, giving West Cost deals nigga
Hair and bone chain, no shirt like plat
But I really hit 'em up, nigga word to my cock!
Ambitious every day, I sit and relax
Smoking weed, shorty on her knees, blowing me back to the future
I'm now in the DeLorean, driving up the Rrari
I ain't fan Cardigan
Tears of joy, Lord knows that I sin
But why would I repent, I was going for the win
It all comes with it, pause no gimmicks
I'm just being me to the T, no lyrics!
Filled with lies, main reason I don't feel you guys
I don't act like it ain't fake, I don't compromise my integrity
Or credibility
You rappers gon pay to fuck with a G

[Hook:]
I'm so ambitious
I want me a Ferrari, but I'm driving a Benz
But how you're gonna get it, well that depends

Pretty eyes hoes got me so ambitious
Diamonds with the gold got me so ambitious
Tried to get more 'cause I'm so ambitious
I'm so ambitious!
I'm so ambitious!

[Verse 3:]
It's a lot of niggas out saying they act like this
But I'm really in the streets, so I act like this
Attitude rough and loud, hold the mac like this
Sideways got the handle on a airtight blunt
A lot of niggas out here broke, like that anti 5th
Get that basic good shit when I snap my wrist
Put your air to your pot, hear the snack crack pop
See he'll probably lose his mind when he slam that rock
Cold winters, hot summers, man I'm on that block
It's Blocksdale nigga, a mother fucking problem
Hit a nigga with a mac, put it's top bullets like
Shoot first, no questions at all
Cocaine, low flame when I'm puffing the loud
I see my homie hoe flip a coin on a foe
Heads or tails your faith, either way it's a go
Back to your face while I'm fucking up your place, mother fucker!

[Hook:]
I'm so ambitious
I want me a Ferrari, but I'm driving a Benz

I be selling dope with my friends

I'm so ambitious

Pretty eyes hoes got me so ambitious
Diamonds with the gold got me so ambitious
Tried to get more 'cause I'm so ambitious
I'm so ambitious!
I'm so ambitious!
