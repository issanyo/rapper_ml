[Intro]
Stayin' to survive
Everybody goin’ through somethin'
Know y'all remain strong
I got us, you heard? Ayy

[Chorus]
I can’t cry but I want to, I deal with the pain
It feels so insane to deal with the pain but I do
I deal with the pain
It feels so insane, I deal with the
I can't cry but I want to, I deal with the pain
It feels so insane to deal with the pain but I do
I deal with the pain
It feels so insane, I deal with the

[Verse 1]
Dealin' with a lot (Dealin' with a lot)
Sendin' pairs up top (Sendin' pairs up top)
These feelings that I got (These feelings that I got)
I conversate with guap (I conversate with guap)
Oh, you got a lot? (Oh, you got a lot?)
Homie sent the opps (Homie sent the opps)
More dangerous (More dangerous)
Then niggas that I shot (Then niggas that I shot)
Always be aware 'bout where I move at
A screwed up face could be a case, gotta know who's that
I would rather people be like, "Why you do that?"
Before me be dyin’, Mama cryin’, suits black

[Chorus]
I can't cry but I want to, I deal with the pain
It feels so insane to deal with the pain but I do
I deal with the pain
It feels so insane, I deal with the
I can’t cry but I want to, I deal with the pain
It feels so insane to deal with the pain but I do
I deal with the pain
It feels so insane, I deal with the

[Verse 2]
Ayy, these niggas bitch but talk about like a dog do
But through it all, somehow my pockets went unguarded though
I don't play no games but at these games I'm on the floor though
This type of pain'll put your bitch ass on the floor, bro
Doin’ well, cryin' like a bitch
Without tears, I drip, I'm young, black, and rich
I ain't fazed by shit, fuck how dark it gets
As long as I ain't RIP, this money, I'ma get
Keep pushin' 'til you in

[Chorus]
I can't cry but I want to, I deal with the pain
It feels so insane to deal with the pain but I do
I deal with the pain
It feels so insane, I deal with the
I can't cry but I want to, I deal with the pain
It feels so insane to deal with the pain but I do
I deal with the pain
It feels so insane, I deal with the

[Outro]
I can't cry but I want to, I deal with the pain
It feels so insane to deal with the pain but I do
I deal with the pain
It feels so insane, I deal with the
I can't cry but I want to, I deal with the pain
It feels so insane to deal with the pain but I do
I deal with the pain
It feels so insane, I deal with the
