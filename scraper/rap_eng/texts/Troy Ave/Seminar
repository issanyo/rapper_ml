I can school you how to do it like me
How to cop your own grams, how to move 'em like me
How to get 'em gone in one day, maneuver like me
Ain't no talkin' in my class, pay attention you'll see
Just let me school you in my seminar
Just let me school you in my seminar
Just let me school you in my seminar
Just let me school you in my seminar

[Verse 1: FMG Dez]
Shout to my plug he got me over that hump
Now I got the cash to buy any car that I want
You know they come wrapped up with blood on 'em, them bitches pure as virgins
Get a 60 day run with this and come thru in something German
Bitch, my phone do a buck a day, I stay busy
Mismatching my designers everyday, I stay jiggy
Every time you see me guaranteed to have bands on me
This heroin so good that I sell it to fiends only
This fast life got me tired, I doze off when I sit down
Maneuverin' them rentals hit them highways and burn 'em down
You can't destroy my clientele 'cause Stack house phone got every one
I always been a real nigga, and been like that since day one

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Troy Ave]
Class in session
Pads be kept in
Crack fiends name make like half [?]
Thirty five [?] from that glass that's measurin'
Seven hundred grams, sold it to him still wet
He ain't even care, it go soon as he step in
When they see that teardrop on it they be checkin'
They [?]
I bought [?]
This jungle turned to concrete
Duece fever on my feet
Semeinars, I teach, if you play, I play for keeps
Take it back and say the least
About my name, or I will creep
Rock a bye your ass to sleep
I get money, life is cheap

[Hook]

[Verse 3: FMG Dez]
The 'caine move good, but the smack move faster
I'm stylin' on these niggas, straight D boy swagger
I'm hard on these broads like blue viagras
I'm cumin' down they faces like black mascara
I talk that drug dealer shit because I'm knee deep in it
Stood up and held my hood down like I'm cemented
Scramble up and put T's out and watch 'em come get it
If you trynna cop a couple grams I have it delivered
Real rap I ain't trynna rhyme, really organized them dope lines
Two hundred grams on the three, I'll see my money back in no time
Scrambled dope and give it names, this right here a disaster
East Baltimore dope dealer, the streets don't respect broke niggas

[Hook]
