[Intro]:
I wrote this in jail I'm back though, you heard
Couldn't wait to get back
Can't wait to get back get in my V and pull the fuck off
Tried to hold a nigga ransom, money too long you heard

[Verse 1]:
Real street nigga talking bout' the real streets
All my V's drop from the foreigns to the Jeep
Let the sunshine in thank you lord beep-beep
Hot boy Troy heading out to a freak
And She pull up, I get the workout without pull ups
My son almost 2 I'm getting money for his pull-ups
Use the leftovers for a house and Range Rover
Bought my baby moms her first one, now that thing over
Waiting for this damn case to be the same thing
Everyday I think about my homie Bang Bang
Lemon pepper wings soon as I get out of jail
Gotta buy a new phone cause police kept my cell
And my jewelry but a nigga getting all new ice
B$B chains, big rings boss up your life
Married to the game but still fucking your wife
You been hating so her pussy for revenge feels nice

[Hook X2]:
Riding in my whip all my paperwork legit
I'm official, nigga you officially be riding dick
Up in rush hour traffic, I ain't in a rush though
Cause these bitches gotta wait and this dutch burn slow

[Verse 2]:
When I was young I always wanted to grow up and get guap
Couldn't make this type of bread as a fireman or cop
Too much student loans to become a lawyer or a doc
I ain't into owing, paid for all my kilos on the spot
Got a cool lil' chick who smuggle bricks straight pass
Real pretty but was skinny till I bought that bitch a ass
Can't nobody say I ain't give back to the community
Gotta look at people strange who say they ain't feeling me
I'm a living legend out the city, y'all stand tall
If you from the hood though, know I represent you all
I got love for every coast and every nigga tryna make it
I got questions for the ones that see us  movin and they hated
Why you mad huh tell me why you mad motherfucker
I'm gonna start acting funny style like im Chris Tucker
Up in rush hour traffic I ain't in a rush though
Cause these bitches wait and this dutch burn slow
Riding in my whip all my paperwork legit
I'm official nigga, you officially be riding dick
I went about it the right way humble and you left out
I been said you can't have your hand and your chest out
I remember feeling good when my coke was fresh out
But when they was calling and I ain't have no more I was stressed out
I put 2 on every 10 that way it stretched out
1200 every 1000 that clears any debt out, damn

Impressive as a motherfucker, real hustlers know
Put a little ice in that thing, It'll take you a long way
