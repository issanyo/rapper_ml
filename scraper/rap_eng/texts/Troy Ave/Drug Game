[Intro]
Bullet holes in my leg on the left
Thank God I still have breath

[Hook]
Drug game, drug game, drug game
Nigga caught up in the drug game
With the weed and the pills and the cocaine, cocaine
Nigga caught up in the drug game

[Verse 1]
Enticed by the devil, making brash decisions
Mesmerized by the streets and seduced by women
It's really difficult to fall victim
Ever so apparent where prison is where they stick them
The punishment rarely fits the crime
Painted as a villain in the New York Times
Made the paper then made the paper, it's ironic
Only thing it made mom love do was vomit
Throw up, little nigga growed up with no daddy
The examples he was shown proved tacky
You can't raise a man if you ain't one yourself
Getting all your cred from the gun on your belt
Spraying for the thrills, pays none of the bills
Took all of our income tax money to play the field
The drug game got him coming off the court room bench
Lawer fees where his re-up and the proceeds went, damn

[Hook X2]
Drug game, drug game, drug game
Nigga caught up in the drug game
With the weed and the pills and the cocaine, cocaine
Nigga caught up in the drug game, word
Drug game, drug game, drug game
Nigga caught up in the drug game
With the weed and the pills and heroine, heroine
Nigga caught up in the drug game, word

[Verse 2]
Making phone calls reaching out to the homies
With every ring out he could see they the phonies
In a four corner room thinking about his mistakes
All the valleys and peaks and why he can't catch a break
So his wifey comes all the way upstate for a visit
It's denied cause he saw his side bitch, she was livid
Turned around, goes around, comes around, dials her number
She accidentally picks up, he hears another nigga fucking
He like "Gina, you bitch. You hoe
I'm a kill you!" At the same time he's dying slow
Cause a real hoe from the town that he slayed
On a horny late night in the trap had AIDS
Dirty dick took a little dip for some dope
He wore a condom but that pussy felt better when it broke
Wetter with the stroke, she put the metal with the pole
Few hours later cops raid and put the metal to his throat, damn

[Hook]
Drug game, drug game, drug game
Nigga caught up in the drug game
With the weed and the pills and the cocaine, cocaine
Nigga caught up in the drug game, word
Drug game, drug game, drug game
Nigga caught up in the drug game
With the weed and the pills and the heroine, heroine
Nigga caught up in the drug game, word
