[Intro]
God is great, paper straight, 808
Ain't no rules when you ruthless

[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Sucker fired I got the hit damn
I beat him up and took his pistol (right out his hand)
I was blowin' to make him rip (RIP)
He was scared and he was swift (table's turned now watch him flee)
Im just 2 legit 2 quit (word word won't stop)
Niggas tried to kill me in my whip. (in my pretty red drop)
God say you ain't killin' shit (killin' nothin')
Anklet bracelet on me so I ain't have my grip (they be check that's how I bluffin)
I would have gunned that pussy down (smoke all in his face)
Niggas know how I get down (turn you to a cold case)
I do murder without a sound (I don't argue no yellin')
I do murders and don't get found (if they dead then who tellin')
I'm only loyal to my fam (It's the truth)
Middle finger from the stand (It's either me or it's you)
I was in and out of hell ([?] I was the ghost)
I will laugh when they send that opp to jail (I use my power like Ghost)
Ain't no rules when you ruthless
Nothin' since these niggas too fake leave em toothless (gums)
Punch yo mouth not a clock (Dominoes was a joke)
Only work I got is plocks (I'm sellin' powder before coke)
Water whip until it rocks (skrt skrt skrtttt)
That's how I made livin' after I got knocked (Corny ass Rikers Island)
Came home and started spendin' (Bought 3 cribs now I'm stylin')
I got a lawsuit pendin' (I'm innocent and it's pilin')
Twenty million dollars later
And I still don't give a fuck about a hater (I can't give em no edge)
I'm just 2 legit 2 quit (That's a fact)
You can't forget how niggas switch (Can't come back)
I cut him off now they ain't shit (where they at?)
Out here tryna' get on by ridin' dick
