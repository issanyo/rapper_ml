[Hook]
If you praying on my downfall
(Praying on my downfall)
Better get yourself a kneepad
(Get yourself some kneepads, that thing ain’t gon wait for you I promise you it’s a fact though)
If you praying on my downfall
(They say good things happen to good niggas, God knows how hard)
Better get yourself a kneepad
(Nigga must be the fact nigga too strong, praying too long, fact though)

[Verse 1]
Niggas praying on my downfall cause they don’t want me to ball
Ran went through the door almost a mural on wall
Hit in my head, let on my jug
Fuck nigas couldn’t even score
I clean this shit up like I’m doing a chore
Dirty money before being on tour
I got the real packs
From drug dealing, murder and killing
Being on stage with Pusha and Fab
Told ya’ll i’s the only life I know
Real running outta town with some bricks to blow
Never thought I would make a hit and blow
But your style did it for me white Christmas flow
I get up most steps on the ladder of success
So why am I so stressed
So why am I so stressed
Writing down my day in diamonds clear as light
In the mirrored light like how you pick up your checks
Money buys my happiness I pick up more checks
I’ve been let down by many so  had to pick up and go get
Empty promises, just a past of the process
Told myself I’d be rich and i wouldn’t settle or no less

If you praying on my downfall

Better get yourself a kneepad

[Verse 2]
Still praying on my downfall but they ain’t holding
Till I send a couple round tours then they be holding
Do these things by my lump sum cannot decode these
Kush just a nigga I don’t smoke a lot I cannot do Opi’s
Fuck the police and fake ass code in these streets
Niggas be preaching until it don’t benefit them then they go to the [?]
It’s a handicap way of seeing cause that will keep you on the scene
Is that to keep you from achievements
I took the crabs with the bounce [?]
I don’t want no fake niggas around me
I don’t want no fake bitches around me
Keep your bad vibes, keep your bad vibes
Keep your bad vibes, keep your bad vibes
I don’t want no fake niggas around me
I don’t want no fake bitches around me
Keep your bad vibes, keep your bad vibes
Keep your bad vibes, keep your bad vibes
