[Hook: x2]
Man there's hoes all where I ain't, hoes all on that block
Told ya I ain't playin, don't believe me – get shot
Don't believe me – get shot, don't believe me – get shot
Nigga nigga nigga don't believe me – get shot, don't believe me – get shot

[Verse:]
Mob stones ain't for fuck, no way
I'm a well-known young drug dealer
In the clubs, mad guns with us
And man hundreds of bitches fuckin with us
I got 2 snickers like 2 Pac
I don't truce niggas down the rooftop
Making flying shit but talking flying shit
DOA, flies and shit
Everybody ganged real, everybody ganged bill
But if everybody would just be their self
Then the world would have a gudda feel
Cause if I feel like fuck you
When I see you I'm a snuff you
I'm a cut you, gun but you
Cock cock back and buck you
Man I shot this pussy, I'm jettin
Shot this pussy now I'm jettin
When the police come, the world is mum
All the witnesses are forgettin
5 6, seat low
Gambling with my freedom
Got a hot now like ethrow
But it's Troy Ave, I'm me ho
One to one, I'm the one
It was Big J, bad man with son
Sun mean and I shine
You know my jewelry too cause I grind
With the coke thing, blow thing
Til your head cut open
Rockstar, smoke things
All you base but they pipe steam
Tear drop but no cryin
This some good shit says Brian
If it's straight drop then they buyin
They demand that, I'm supplyin
Point 2 and they flyin
I make a point too with that iron
If I point to you they firin
Lord strike me if I'm lyin

[Hook: x2]
Man there's hoes all where I ain't, hoes all on that block
Told ya I ain't playin, don't believe me – get shot
Don't believe me – get shot, don't believe me – get shot
Nigga nigga nigga don't believe me – get shot, don't believe me – get shot
