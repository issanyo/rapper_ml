You can do your hair and your make-up
But I don't want no girl with no fake butt
And you can look like shit when we wake-up
But I don't want no girl with no fake butt
And you ain't even got to hook a steak up
I don't want no girl with no fake butt
I know you under pressure as a lady but
I don't want no girl with no fake butt

Fake butt busta
We see you, we know you
We see you, we know you
Fake butt busta
We see you, we know you
We see you, we know you
Fake butt busta
We see you, we know you
We see you, we know you
Fake butt busta
We see you, we know you
We know you

Shouts to all my bitches with the real hair
Stylin' on them broads with the fake hair
And even if you got a little cake there
Then you better than them hoes with the fake rear
It's a little jelly, see you hate there
They might even tryin' to act like you're doin' better
But you gonna be the one with the smoke clear
Be with a real nigga
Cause he knows better

You can do your hair and your make-up
But I don't want no girl with no fake butt
And you can look like shit when we wake-up
But I don't want no girl with no fake butt
And you ain't even got to hook a steak up
I don't want no girl with no fake butt
I know you under pressure as a lady but
I don't want no girl with no fake butt

Fake butt busta
We see you, we know you
We see you, we know you
Fake butt busta
We see you, we know you
We see you, we know you
Fake butt busta

It's a lot of frauds with fake jewels
20 15 'til we getting' you the blues
You ain't got a car and a crib too
How you spend 40k on your wrist dude?
Fake it 'til you make it aw man, dog
Swiping credit, wheres your cash you don't really ball
Fake booty broads ain't forget you
Lookin' like a toothpick and a meatball

You can do your hair and your make-up
But I don't want no girl with no fake butt
And you can look like shit when we wake-up
But I don't want no girl with no fake butt
And you ain't even got to hook a steak up
I don't want no girl with no fake butt
I know you under pressure as a lady but
I don't want no girl with no fake butt
