(Troy Ave Talking)
I mean sometimes the truth is just disrespectful
It ain’t no way to be politically correct in there
And they sugar coast shit, you know what I mean?

(Hook – Troy Ave)
I walk up in the spot with my jewels on
Standing on the couch with my boots on
I wish a nigga would tell me “You wrong!”
I wink my eye at your bitch now your boo gone!
I might pipe, I might lie, but I don’t love these heauxs
I might lust, I might crush but I don’t love these heauxs
I might hit then might split, ’cause I don’t love these heauxs
I don’t love these heauxs, I don’t love these heauxs

(Verse 1 – Chase N Cashe)
See I walk up in the spot with my jewels on, yeah fresh off the block with my boots on
Bad bitch that I like wearing two tone, pointed at her on site, told her “You gone!”
All work, no work no play what are you on?, All work more pay yeah my crew on
Street Terrace, blue Rolex in my true song, man it’s OG that I’m smoking nigga too strong!
Money money money nigga, count that, hustle rings no sunny nigga I’m bout that
Get your bitch in the club, pull up out that, for a baller she would do it Spaulding ..and bounce that
For a real one she would move out the work, yeah cop that, once is in and she got a strip “my bad”
Niggas out here trying to love them heauxs, don’t do that I’m only in it for the love of dough you knew that
