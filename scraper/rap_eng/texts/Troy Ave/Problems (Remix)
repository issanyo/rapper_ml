[Hook – Rich The Kid]
What you tryna do shawty, I’m a millionaire
I got bands on me, jumping out of helicopters, eating steak and lobster
I get guala with my partners
I’m in Haiti, bitch I ain’t gon have no problems
I got rich nigga problems
I got issues, I got motherfucking problems
I got problems, I got rich nigga problems
Young nigga I came from the bottom
Now that I’m rich I got problems

[Verse 1 – Rich The Kid]
These bitches be [?] their favorite, red bottoms, I bleed when I’m walking
These bitches is dirty, my niggas is flirty, my [?] is so muddy
At the age of 13 I was in and out of juvie
Now my life is a movie
You cuffing and kissing and giving her money
She fucked me, she nothing but a groupie
[?] love her, forgiven for sins I committed
18 I was looking at prison
Sat in my cell and I pray
Got to thank god cause he showed me the way
Fired my lawyer and I beat the case
Don’t want a pic, get the fuck out my face
My necklace is covered in diamonds my nigga, your bitch want to skate
King of the trap, it’s jumping and booming [?] young nigga, get money
I gave em a hundred, I ride in a Masi on twenties
They say I won’t make it but now they see bitches, they call the Mercedes like
Rich nigga I trap out a mansion, I’m walking around like the governor

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Walking around with a fifty, Versace like Biggie
I’m rich, what the fuck [?]
These bitches calling and [?] young nigga
The king of my city, two chains but no Tity
I’m richer than Diddy
I’m trapping the Hannah and Lizzy
The lean is killing my kidneys, Monefa she got to stay with me
I came from the bottom, back then I was starving
Capping and trapping and robbing
You can hate me now but I won’t stop now
Young nigga walk round with a touch down
My mama she told me these niggas they fake
They plotting, they know that you made it
I had to stay patient, I waited
Fuck nigga I’m finally famous
Flex on my shoes [?], diamonds ocean blue
You taking her out for a dinner and movie, she fucking the crew
You wife her, you taking lil mama, young nigga she laughing at you
You fucking that ho no rubber, she a prostitute!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 – Troy Ave]
I’m a rich nigga, broke nigga, please shut the fuck up
I’m talking to you with manners after [?] to dust
These road, wrestling with these Os
36 polka dots, 100 [?] is my gold
Ten height when it’s sold

Niggas know what time it is
My neck and Rolex be gold
Bezel holy, they froze
Lord knows they watching me, oh
I’m just a rich kid getting it with my migos
Shouts out to them nigga, moneys my best friend nigga
Can’t forget my gun and my [?], I’m nothing without them nigga
One for the [?], one for the [?]
Either way your time’s up, my time’s now, I’m popping

[Hook]
