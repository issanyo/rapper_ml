[Hook: Bobby Capri]

I got that brown paper bag
With that green paper in it
Coming to me one way
With a million ways to spent it Hol' up!
I know it only take a minute to blow it
I'm hoping I don't do that shit the day I get it

I got that brown paper bag
With that green paper in it
Coming to me one way
With a million ways to spent it Hol' up!
I know it only take a minute to blow it
I'm hoping I don't do that shit the day I get it

[Verse 1: Bobby Capri]

I'm in a catch 22, like a pass to Emmit
Now, what the fuck should I do?
Should I stand out here and get it?
Or...just forget it; cause this shit ain't worth my time?
Work hard for that bullshit pay and be content with that 9 to 5?
I might get fired. On purpose
Me working here, ain't working
I'll collect that unemployment
Then flip that shit when the first come
That's how this bout to go down
I know that I should slow down
But that paper come too fast...
And there's way too much to go a-round
Not to have my fair share of it
I ain't sharing nothing
Cause motherfuckers ain't ever held me down
If anything, they held me back
I've been through hell and back
You can't forget where the hell we at
Now, where the hell am I going?
"To hell" if I don't "change my ways"
That's what they say
I find it mind blowing
That, they don't mind throwing
Rocks, living in a glass house...
With their curtains pulled all the way back
Tryna see you assed out

[Verse 2: Troy Ave]

Alright! alright!

Paper chase
Making base
Flake to an oil paste
Whether on or smoking it
They gon let me know the taste
You already snow the plate
Lined with the paper
Daily news, page 5
Air dry
Weighed about a half
Might lose a 2
I put a couple extra, you still up a few
3 point fevers
Dimes no divas
Them bitches gon make you 600
And them eager
Blow it on whatever! It always come back
A n***a like me, shit, I spend it on a strap
Buy myself a Mac
Fuck it, just mack
Spend it on a chick if I'm fucking up her Mac
Now back to the grind
Cause I love to shine
Brown paper bags how you paying?
Just fine
All money good. Get it how you living
Cause when it's time to spend it
They don't ask you where you get it
Powderrr!
