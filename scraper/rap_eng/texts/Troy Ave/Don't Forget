[Verse 1]
He grew up with two parents in the house
Who provided him his way out
Went to private school, wasn’t like them other fools
Who was uneducated and took the dummy route
Went from watching crime out the window
To participating, light smoking indigo
With some knuckleheads instead of tryna elevate
In the house, off next shit, not even thinking straight
Used to say basketball when asked what his hobbies be
Now he scams crack selling on robberies
Using daddy’s car, he’s the getaway driver
Everything was running smooth till that one with no survivor
On a high speed chase, panicked look on his face
[?] own fire learn boom murderous look on his face
Whipping, whippin through the streets tryna ditch ‘em
Wrong turn head on collision damn
Whipping, whipping through the streets tryna ditch ‘em
Wrong turn head on collision damn

[Hook]
Don’t forget who you are
Don’t forget who you are
(Don’t forget who you are)
Don’t forget who you are
Don’t forget who you are
(Don’t forget who you are)
Don’t forget who you are
Don’t forget who you are
(Don’t forget who you are)
Don’t forget who you are
Don’t forget who you are
(Don’t forget who you are)

[Verse 2]
Shareif always been a suck
In tenth grade he wifed a hoe and he dropped her
Got back slapped by a dude she was fucking
In front of McDonalds and everybody he did nothing
Later on he tried to dabble round in the streets
Get it on a pound of weed and he didn’t say a peep
Got hit on the head with a bottle in the club
[?] money [?] like he still judging
Chick round him niggas ran in his crib like it’s legal
Took it all he just took a job as a CO
Walking round like he tough when he really ass
How quickly they forget with a uniform and badge
Roughing up the type that used to victimize him
Abusing his authority a coward’s revenge
Little average, picked the wrong one in the wrong place
The inmate got out and shot him twice in the face
Stinging up the floor heart coming to a flutter
He just left the girl house and the killer was her brother
Shareif always been a sucker
And to top it off he’s a dead motherfucker

[Hook]
Don’t forget who you are
Don’t forget who you are
(Don’t forget who you are)
Don’t forget who you are
Don’t forget who you are
(Don’t forget who you are)
Don’t forget who you are
Don’t forget who you are
(Don’t forget who you are)
Don’t forget who you are
Don’t forget who you are
(Don’t forget who you are)

[Verse 3]
Highwood homecoming everything was great
She was said to be the class 2008
Went to stadium where women shake their ass for take
She was on a scholarship so all her needs were straight
But every girl has once, dark skin gold fronts
Gold chains, gold rings, drinking bottles, smoking blunts
Fell in love at first sight with both him and the life
Style and profile of a hustler’s wife
E’en at the end, she’s naive he pretends
What he’s doing’s fail proof and won’t put him in the pen
Pulling every weekend with the red Porsche brakes
Ask the people he was seeing before they went on dates
It was the first day of Christmas he fulfilled up a wish list
A Warren and VA routine style field trip to the county jail
They ain’t give him no bail
He had his sister bring his girl something wrapped up for scale
Five hundred grams they had wrong for the sell on
The guy she meets with was sell off
First fellow on the scene showed he’s caught up in between
Now she’s facing fifteen in the bean, damn

[Hook]
Don’t forget who you are
Don’t forget who you are
(Don’t forget who you are)
Don’t forget who you are
Don’t forget who you are
(Don’t forget who you are)
Don’t forget who you are
Don’t forget who you are
(Don’t forget who you are)
Don’t forget who you are
Don’t forget who you are
(Don’t forget who you are)
