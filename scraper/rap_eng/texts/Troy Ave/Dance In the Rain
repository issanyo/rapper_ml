(Chorus)
You ever been loyal and got betrayed?
Found out people ain't who they portray?
This type of thing happens every day
Every smile ain’t a smile is what they say
You only gon' relate if we the same
I'm always choosing fortune over fame
I really been hurt, I still feel pain
Don’t see a sunny day I'll dance in rain
Dance in rain, nigga
Dance in rain, nigga
All this drip on me it feel the same nigga
Dance in rain, nigga
Dance in rain, nigga
All this drip on me it feel the same nigga

(Verse 1)
Got shot in my head I grew some braids nigga
Now I don't fear death I'm not afraid nigga
I'm fearless and I'm ruthless and self made nigga
I got mad they ever got paid nigga
All these fuck niggas talk how they talk
But they ain't got the heart to walk how I walk
I bring to the table everything but pork
They come to the table only bringing forks

(Chorus)
You ever been loyal and got betrayed?
Found out people ain't who they portray?
This type of thing happens every day
Every smile ain’t a smile is what they say
You only gon’ relate if we the same
I'm always choosing fortune over fame
I really been hurt, I still feel pain
Don’t see a sunny day I'll dance in rain
Dance in rain, nigga
Dance in rain, nigga
All this drip on me it feel the same nigga
Dance in rain, nigga
Dance in rain, nigga
All this drip on me it feel the same nigga

(Verse 2)
In my first apartment I had moldy walls
Now I'm moonwalking on my marble floors
Seems I had a lot of friends when I was poor
Now It's Benjamin that’s with me way more
Most my friends are dead really in the morgues
Free the ones that's live, RIP my dawgs!
Every month in court could be me up North
I smoke the stress away and I count it off

(Chorus)
You ever been loyal and got betrayed?
Found out people ain't who they portray?
This type of thing happens every day
Every smile ain't a smile is what they say
You only gon' relate if we the same
I'm always choosing fortune over fame
I really been hurt, I still feel pain
Don't see a sunny day I'll dance in rain
Dance in rain, nigga
Dane in rain, nigga
All this drip on me it feel the same nigga
Dance in rain, nigga
Dane in rain, nigga
All this drip on me it feel the same nigga
