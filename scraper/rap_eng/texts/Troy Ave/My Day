[INTRO]
I got the Georgetown Hoya hat on for the classic feel
Y'all know..

[VERSE 1]
Up early morning late night getting head
A mack with a macbook over polo sheet threads
Cheerios an' strawberries for my days beginner cause this chick I'm with only cooks me dinner
She ain't the top chef but she got the top sex
100 jumping jacks 50 sit-ups 2 sets, lukewarm shower couple puffs of the la
Its hard getting dressed when you this damn fly, kept it plain sweatsuit gold chain
On the way to the studio dropped off cocaine, can't wait for a record deal im tryna get to a mil
I ain't like all these other niggas all my raps is for real
We ain't the same not at all they rise an they fall
From not being humble cause they ain't have shit before, I got me a hustle nigga supplying it raw
Avon whipped up the hard he was right next door, The hood wanna know whats next in store
Bricks in my backpack but this BSB 4, The hood wanna know whats next in store Bricks in my backpack but this BSB 4


[HOOK]
Uhh, Mic check 1-2 1-2 im out here doing my thing nigga you should too
I came up in the game nigga you could too, I made my own lane now my dogs come thru
B$B records reign supreme you see, streets back East coast nigga and thanks to me
B$B records reign supreme you see, I be the young king Troy NYC

[VERSE 2]
I be damned if im fucked up in the struggle no way, I rather the water bubble while I crush up this yay
I got my health so the wealth come from work no play, being broke dont sit right like we setting ?
I like Chanel, and premium cable with every channel, buying girls Chanel bags who dont know and call it Channel
Go stunt on the material ballistic hoes but first stop on herkimer street drop off them O's
Think Im tricking, get it right everything come with a price, You tryna get paid in full that'll cost you life
Its evident when you see what Im flossing like, only the trilly understand why theres all this hype
Commas a do it, not to mention this genre of music, gets ruined cause all the drug addicts and faggots misuse it
And you got some niggas just like them sit in a chair and make a decision on who gets rap album of the year?
Seen the same type of robberies in boxing no doubt, I won't leave it to chance Imma come and knock niggas out
Seen the same type of robberies in boxing no doubt, I won't leave it to chance Imma come and knock niggas out
PowdeRRR, yeah B$B records reign supreme tho, #1 independent label on this scene bro
They say the main stage is for the best, they say they run NY i say I guess

[HOOK]
Uhh, Mic check 1-2 1-2 im out here doing my thing nigga you should too
I came up in the game nigga you could too, I made my own lane now my dogs come thru
B$B records reign supreme you see, streets back East coast nigga and thanks to me
B$B records reign supreme you see, I be the young king Troy NYC, motherfuckers
