(Intro)
I hope your next man treat you way worse than I did
And I hope he get you pregnant wit a ugly ass kid
So you appreciate me, maybe then you will appreciate me, word

(Talking)
Ya gotta let the beat build
And tell my real shit you gotta build up the momentum, you know what I'm saying... Word... Pay attention

(Hook)
You gon' lose out on a moment you can never get again
Give the flowers to your people while they hearin' out the end
So appreciate me, maybe now you will appreciate me, word

I hope your next man treat you way worse than I did
And I hope he get you pregnant wit a ugly ass kid
So you appreciate me, maybe then you will appreciate me, word

(Verse One)
Teenage pregnancy by a deadbeat
Still saw potential in you on our first meet
You drove a car that was smokin' fumes wit leaks
I put you in that white range, with the red seats
You was at the crib while my ex was at the door
I got mad bitches and you knew this from before
Dope Boy Troy make the girls go crazy
That ain't gonna change just because we had a baby
I never said I would be faithful, not at all
You ain't bring up other chicks while we shopped in the mall
In your Louboutin, David Yurman charm, Birkin arm
In the biggest trophy lil row rose supermom
But it's just a pacifier you go back to bein' buggy
Cryin' I don't love you, I'm like bitch I love my money
And I give you that, but that ain't proof of nothin give it back
Could of bought Ferrari's gave another chick a kid with that
You don't appreciate me and that's insane
Can't name a nigga that would buy ya house in ya name
I never fuck your family or your friends brought them shame
Would've put you on now you'll get put on to his game
Most men cheat, most men cheat, that is true
Only kind that don't is the kind you ain't attracted to
So here go ya choices, me or them
And if you don't choose me you probably cheat on them

(Hook)
I hope your next man treat you way worse than I did
And I hope he get you pregnant wit a ugly ass kid
So you appreciate me
Maybe then you will appreciate me, word

I be talkin' that for real see my music ain't pretend
From the heart so you can feels know I'm different from them
So appreciate me, maybe now you will appreciate me, word


(Verse Two)
Lil' niggas wanna be in the streets, who taught em
A nigga who ain't really livin' his raps, he fraudin'
Big money, drug usin', violent discussions
All type of artillery that he ain't bustin'
Braggin' bout bad bitches... stop frontin'
You had a child before rap ya baby moms is nothin'
And show you all the pros not the cons of wealth
As soon as it turns you calm you been conned yaself
Listen lil man I'm designed to do me
Started at 10 grams then I got to a key
Knew that this wasn't the end for me
Knew I was gonna try to get out the streets eventually
I opened up businesses legitimately
Listen to opportunity presented to me
It's true though, I surpass most niggas that you know
I'm connected my plug look like he was in Menudo
I'm more Rickey Henderson to woods then Martin
Runnin' base, runnin' through hoes I'm just startin'
You can do the same, you just gotta know some things
The risk that come with this shit could make ya whole life change

(Hook)
I be talkin' that for real see my music ain't pretend
From the heart so you can feel know I'm different from them
So appreciate me, maybe now you will appreciate me, word

You gon' lose out on a moment you can never get again
Give the flowers to your people while they hearin' out the end
So appreciate me, maybe now you will appreciate me, word


(Verse Three)
Rest in peace Aunt Maddy
She was the sister of my grandmother from my daddy
A black queen in corona Queens by way of Alabama
Had a brother Uncle Junior he showed me my first hammer blaow
Wow, I was only 8
When you first made me sweet potatoes, ah it was great
And the taste, of the melted marshmallows what I crave
You would smoke ya cigarettes, tell me don't talk in spades
May my ace boon coon, and a bit of a joker
Drenched me with the water hose cause by mistake I super soaked ya
One of the funnest times of my childhood
Thinkin' back on it Aunt Maddy you was wild hood
Drinkin E&J, numbers you would play
Cover up the smell of burnt reefer with a spray
In the driveway always kept you a caddy
I love, miss, and appreciate my Aunt Maddy

(Hook)
I be talkin' that for real see my music ain't pretend
From the heart so you can feels know I'm different from them
So appreciate me, maybe now you will appreciate me, word

You gon' lose out on a moment you can never get again
Give the flowers to your people while they airin out the M's
So appreciate me, maybe now you will appreciate me, word
