[Verse:]
Got my swag shooter on, I need a brand new case
Man I'm fly as fuck the flavor went King K
Paints on the road, fly as shit when we broke
Seasons four, winter, spring, summer, autumn
HP, BSB, HE, LL, O baby yes me
Hoes feelin, smooth skinning, drug dealer
Mad niggas be out on the yolk my buzz iller
I'm a ill nigga, dog rise by ill figure as a little nigga
Count G's now I'm a biggie in the dope game
Than these fellow niggas with rap names
I'm named after my block, Troy Ave lane
Chitty-chitty, bang bang, still in this street thing
We'll be at the bar, play Nets versus Heat game
Powder, what these other niggas sees man
See same cheat man, these other niggas weak mane
Talking bout their proud of me
Pay attention at my moves but I style for free
Many bum niggas styling ain't no styling me
Big riding never been transportation be

[Outro:]
That's all you get for free
Powder!
Aha!

Mothe fucker
Get high motherfucker
We getting loud motherfucker
Aha motherfucker!
Is you ready to die motherfucker?
