[Hook: Troy Ave]
I'm the only one who got the job done
I got the juice now, I could let you borrow some
Here's a couple apples from the saviour of the apple
They ain't believe I wrote about it like the book of Matthew
Now you see, believe me
BSB the brand, I am King T
They just let you down, they ain't [?]
Cook, take a look, where the fuck they be?
Nowhere, magazines no photo there
Name a fuckin' town, they ain't even got a show there
Bunch of bitches round, they ain't even got a ho here
I'm Bruce Lee Troy, yeah the glow here, nigga

[Verse 2: Young Lito]
Uh, It's BSB we right back on that real shit
And were I'm coming talk, homie we come to kill shit
I got a short temper, guess it's just that ville shit
We known to bring out them big guns for lil' shit
So if you see someone in a blanket it ain't Will Smith
But we might be playin' Jada, let's still spit
My heart numb, I don't feel shit
But I'm cooler now, tryna be on some chill shit
But these niggas they just tweak shit
And I don't really do the internet beef shit
[?] my brother, he be on some peace shit
Me I'd rather get the gun and RIP shit
It ain't a secret, nigga we a [?] shit
Fuckin' all the hoes that you wishin' you could sleep with
Nigga you ain't nice, you just half way decent
Never gettin' light, you're career's on a leash bitch
And you niggas dissin', man are you kidding me?
Y'all been rappin' before I lost my virginity
Now I'm rappin' you're tryna feed off my energy
You're a strugglin' rapper, you not my enemy
I mean literally, what the fuck is a
To some young niggas ballin', my nigga am one
"Take that" like Diddy say
Fuck you and your 50k, I kill you niggas any day

[Hook]

[Verse 3: King Sevin]
BSB them niggas though
You fuck with me you gotta fuck one of my niggas ho
All in her mouth, I ain't tryna be a dentist though
She ain't half blooded, but she catch it when I finish, woah
I'm still a BSB stunta
Got spurs in the winter, fly cars in the summer
I run the plays, I ain't gotta get her number
I touch down and send her back like a punter
Cause if I kick it to her she ain't coming back
She gon' run through my team like a running back
I give you fifty, want a hundred back
Or when you see me you, how you [?] like a lumberjack
Believe me, it's easy
Shorty blind, I ain't the one she came to see
I'm on my grind I'm the one you never see
A bitch can lose her mind and she gon' still remember me

[Verse 4: Avon Blocksdale]
Block coming through and I get the job done
Ran up on him with the nine that how I drop some
I'm playing eeny miney mo on niggas
That's anybody getting hit when I blow the triggers
Blocksdale, I could teach you how to tow a nigga
Four pound, take em down underneath the sewer nigga
Come on, let me show you how that Glock work
Headshot, make a motherfuckin' top squirt
Come on, I can tell you how that clock work
On the block, careful when them narcs [?]
Chef base, so-so on the stove top
Corner after corner, half a bird in a week
You'll get served in the streets
Throwing words over beats
[?] when its beef
Niggas rather take to tweets
Doesn't matter I could get a nigga murdered in a week
So fuck a tweet, I could get a nigga murdered in the streets
