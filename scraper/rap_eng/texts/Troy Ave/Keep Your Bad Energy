[Intro]
I'm not lettin' any bad energy around me this time, now
I don't know what the fuck I was thinkin', word
Fanatics

[Chorus]
Bought every Rollie and still ain't got time (Brrt)
You showed me you fake, but really I'm blind (Brrt)
Cappin' for clout, I don't wanna hear it (Brrt)
Money is time, I don't wanna spare it (Brrt)
Bought every Rollie and still ain't got time (Brrt)
You showed me you fake, but really I'm blind (Brrt)
Cappin' for clout, I don't wanna hear it (Brrt)
Money is time, I don't wanna spare it (Brrt)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, if your presence don't add value to my life
Then your absence really do not make a difference
Fuck nigga, I do not want your advice
You ain't done nothin' that's impressive, keep your distance
I'm a boss, get yourself a pack
I'm levels up, top floor of the walled-off
They took a knife and he stabbed me in the back
I pulled it out and I cut them niggas all off
Negative credits wastin' my time
Jealous, selfish, disappointments, ain't no friends of mine
Surround yourself with folks that make you happy, hear me clearer
If it's no real ones around, buy a bunch of mirrors
If you practice realism, fake niggas fear us
They wanna assassinate my characters and hopes it tear us
Apart, can't break my spirit or my heart
Real stars shine through the dark, Dope Boy Troy, nigga

[Chorus]
Bought every Rollie and still ain't got time (Brrt)
You showed me you fake, but really I'm blind (Brrt)
Cappin' for clout, I don't wanna hear it (Brrt)
Money is time, I don't wanna spare it (Brrt)
Bought every Rollie and still ain't got time (Brrt)
You showed me you fake, but really I'm blind (Brrt)
Cappin' for clout, I don't wanna hear it (Brrt)
Money is time, I don't wanna spare it (Brrt)

[Verse 2]
My truth got me on the industry "don't deal" list
'Cause these lyin' niggas easier to deal with
Do what they told, the closet skeletons come real quick
I do what I want, don't give a fuck, and I'm for real rich
Born leader, motivatin' through your speakers
If niggas 'round you don't put in work then they some leeches
I'm blessed 'cause I praise God more than my preacher
My street smarts made me more money than my teachers
I once failed science 'cause I cut to get some pussy
Mr. Myers don't know how to turn soft cocaine into cookie
Never dwell on the past, it turn toxic if you care
Escaped from the crowded barrel, now I'm breathin' fresh air
And I'm seein' more food, 'cause I got a bigger table
And a big apple movin' with the K, it made me able
To be me, I tell my life, ain't tell one motherfuckin' fable
BSB my label, nigga, fuck them labels, own yourself

[Chorus]
Bought every Rollie and still ain't got time (Brrt)
You showed me you fake, but really I'm blind (Brrt)
Cappin' for clout, I don't wanna hear it (Brrt)
Money is time, I don't wanna spare it (Brrt)
Bought every Rollie and still ain't got time (Brrt)
You showed me you fake, but really I'm blind (Brrt)
Cappin' for clout, I don't wanna hear it (Brrt)
Money is time, I don't wanna spare it (Brrt)

[Outro]
I'm not lettin' any bad energy around me this time, now
