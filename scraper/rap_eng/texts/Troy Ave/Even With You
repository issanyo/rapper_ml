Dedicated to the real ones who helped me on my feet

[Hook]
Now baby I don't have everything, but you my everything, it's true
On second thought I take that back, can't debate that fact, I got everything 'cause I got you
And I swear, to love you forever and you don't need a wedding band, you got me
For better or for worse, boy is at his worst, help me forget about the dirt, so I know you got me
And I swear, I swear, I can never get even with you
And I swear, I swear, I can never get even with you

Now mama I don't have everything, but you my everything, it's true
On second thought I take that back, can't debate that fact, I got everything 'cause I got you
And I swear, to love you forever and you don't need a wedding band, you got me
For better or for worse, boy is at his worst, help me forget about the dirt, so I know you got me
And I swear, I swear, I can never get even with you
And I swear, I swear, I can never get even with you

[Verse 1]
Dope boy track can't get even with you
Came through all type of seasons with you
Put our first song in a jack to the ground
We done came up but I know you been down
Quick pay the nigga bail, held guns for him
Countin' racks in the motherfuckin' slums for him
You knew that I was goin' to the top
You know ya boy wouldn't stop now I'm ridin' a drop
Foreigns when I roll, and I ain't never sell my soul
Fastlane speedin' through the toll
And gettin' money so Lenny got mo
Nigga that's a fact tho
Dope boy Troy Ave with the cash flow
Bakin' what a whip, wet again, hat low
Out the trap flow, I was that low, made it back though

[Hook]
And I swear, baby I don't have everything, but you my everything, it's true
On second thought I take that back, can't debate that fact, I got everything 'cause I got you
And I swear, to love you forever and you don't need a wedding band, you got me
For better or for worse, when your boy is at his worst, help me forget about the dirt, so I know you got me
And I swear, I swear, I can never get even with you
And I swear, I swear, I could never get even with you
