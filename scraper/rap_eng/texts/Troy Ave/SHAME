VERSE 1:
I wake up
Get dressed
Put my gun on
But no vest
Grind time
Rolex
Paper chase
On your mark set
Real nigga
More or less
Deal giver
I got blow for less
Since hilfiger
I've been photo fresh
Be your self
Who u tryna impress
If the world was sucka free
It would just be me
Me and my niggas
With a couple choice bitches
Who jus fuck
And mind they bizness
No pretenders
Living wit us
Time is money
Talk is cheap
And so if life
And i can make you an expense
So watch your feet
Around my toes
I hit the road
To success
And ain't no breaks
Jus my flow
Trunk full of blow
They both mean doe
Thats mine for the take
Ima be great
Thats not for debate
You gon be fake
With a heart full of hate
When u seeing my face
You seeing my pace
Real nigga shit

If the world was sucka free
It would be me and all my bitches
Can't forget my real niggas
Gettin money

Life is cheap
And i will make you an expense
So watch your feet
Around my high top air force 1's
Fake niggas jus force guns
To they head chest
Thats man down
BROOKLYN know i dont fuck around
When you outta town be humble
Every hood got its own jungle
Underestimates
Be for the fakes
While the real relate
To what guns do
