[Hook]
I made my name up in these streets like a real nigga
I keep them pistols in my jeep like a real nigga
I make sure all my homies eat like a real nigga
I fuck your bitch and go to sleep like a real nigga
Man all my pockets be obese cause I deal nigga
A couple of boxes ain't no sneaks, just some bills nigga
The way I handle all my beefs, I just kill niggas
If you 100 then you love me, I'm a real nigga

[Verse 1]
Chargin' my phone, leave them charges alone
I'm ridin' foreigns and trucks, my rims are matte or they chrome
Smoke a blunt to the dome, I got some shit on my head
I turn some niggas to bone, fuck them all they are dead
I get mad I see red, livin' life, gettin' bread
Gettin' pussy, fuck the opinions of pussies I said
Real niggas on top, free run from the box
Free money yo blocks, teeth white like them sox

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Studio thug, you can't do what I does
I am really a plug, you just cool in them clubs
Before this rap I had bust, feds watchin' and shit
They (?) on that roll, he ain't cooperate shit
I hold 'em down with that cash for bein' real like I knew
Loyalty ain't no favor nigga, its just what we do
(?) is the crew, we get wild like a zoo
But all time, we like chillin' fuckin' with hoes by the two
Man it's nothin', all these bitches is fuckin'
All these niggas is frontin', I see 'em they don't want nothin'
I smack, shoot, or snuff 'em
They don't respect my name
Violence my go to move, I make 'em respect the pain
Motherfuckers
