[Bridge: Emilio Rojas]
And now we rollin' in them '85, '85
Yeah, my shorty tatted up around the waistline
And we be sleeping in the motherfucking day time
I'm getting low with all my bitches, but they stay high

[Hook: Emilio Rojas]
Cause all we do is lean on 'em, yeah, we lean on 'em
I got some bitches in the back with something mean on 'em
Yeah, we lean on 'em, yeah, we lean on 'em
And when I finish I'mma sick the fucking team on 'em
Yeah, we lean on 'em, yeah, we lean on 'em
I got some bitches in the back with something mean on 'em
Yeah, we lean on 'em, yeah, we lean on 'em
And when I finish I'mma sick the fucking team on 'em

[Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
Bad Spanish bitches with ass shots
Yeah, they rolling with the team like a mascot
Matte black '85's in them back lots
Speeding down that motherfuckin black top
Rolling with my spic, that's it
Anybody wanna pop that shit?
And they get hit with a little bit of fist
Until they drop and that is it
And you can find me with some pretty little mami's
Gettin low up in the heights where they watching us outta Crown V's
We living, and sinning not a religion
Never gonna ask for no permission, I act and ask for forgiveness
Yeah, we get it, we living off of the interest
All these bitches doing lines like every day an audition
I'm taking trips and spend my winter with tan lines
Ya'll never fly, I got all you bitches on standby
And we be getting things money can't buy
Young Spanish motherfucker on the ride

[Verse 2: Iamsu!]
Tell the Jamaican homies pass the dutches
I can't stand you niggas like Uncle Ruckus
And these rappers be doing a bunch of nothing
But I stick to fundamentals like my name was Tim Duncan
Like doing what pays me, always dressing crazy
Pulling up with badass B's like Jay-Z
What's the dealio?
It's young Suzy Holiday in the millio
Rolling in them A5 Audi's, what you know about it?
Leaning on them fools like I ate a weed brownie
Wavy on these haters then, now they all drowning
Money counting, every outing
And it's heartbreak 'til my heart break
You should par take
Playing us is like hopping in the shark tank
And it's the gang in your ear
Stay in your lane cause we'll end your career

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Lean on 'em, yeah, they lean on 'em
He got swag, but he dont got no cream on 'em
If he did ten he would've put the beam on 'em
Got the iron and he don't want no steam on 'em
Yeah, I lean on 'em, big body V
Look at my company assume I sold the a lot of thee
Them niggas spending it like they won the lottery
Me, I'm a plant man, fill me up like pottery
Yeah, for real though, I'm viscious on a M-I
See, I used to make rhymes grippin on the semi
Scrambling, these the ramblings of a Jedi
Late night, in the hallway with the red eyes
Lean on 'em, them niggas kick stands
Murder mami's with magazines, keep your distance
I'm in the cut, with the sound and the piff grams
Something mean, got sixteen on six vents, lean on 'em

[Bridge]

[Verse 4: Troy Ave]
It's Troy Ave, I'm that nigga, don't mean to boast
A BK well-known dealer heavy in coke
White leather in chin-chilla, the top off
Neat with the swag like a fiend who pop dope
I'm fixing to pop off, and you snow that
Fixing the pot whipping salt, where the dough at?
Show me the money, I'll say it more clearer
Show me the money, he show me a mirror
Reflecting on my past, pedal getting mashed
High speed paper chase straight ahead to cash
Money off the bates, money chose to hate
Murder was the case when he came and bought the wakes

[Hook]
