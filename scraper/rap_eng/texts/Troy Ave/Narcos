[Hook]
Tengo la cocaína para la venda
Tengo la cocaína para la venda
Si tiene dinero podemos hacer negocios

[Verse 1]
Fat girls having me like papi
Let’s go RIP to Gustavo
Fuck those cheap looking horror
I riding through the town with narcos
Cops see me in the street with them clipping
I’m just a young nigga with ambition coming soon
Taking turns out of town extradition
How you niggers only making cases if you snitching
How many hoes you fucking here
You don't want say when they getting laid
Waking young still having
I’m El Patron, real jefe

[Hook]
Tendo la cocaína para la vela vida
Yo Tengo la cocaína para la vela
Tendo la cocaína para la vela
Si tiene dinero potemo hashima cosillas

[Verse 2]
BSP nigga period
I came up from the slums but i do that
I hate gettin money true that I got a bg of it
I was in miami too bad
They say they want war we can do that
It's killing whatever on first sight here we go
Riding by spraying ozzi on the speed bike where’s my boy
You never bite the hands that feed you God no
You niggers too fake I’m a gangster you feelin me
To my enemies I’m a menace
Cops want to slay me down south
But I’m a be a legend when I’m finished

[Hook]
Tendo la cocaína para la vela vida
Yo Tengo la cocaína para la vela
Tendo la cocaína para la vela
Si tiene dinero potemo hashima cosillas

[Outro]
Imagine without a due we made it out
You feelin me and uhm what I’m

This shit free you know download it
You know am saying Spread the word
And then we going to drop mother fucking uhm
Brakes in my backpack for
On december the fourth and in that one
That one is for you to go out and buy
You know this is going to be EP on album
The pain I feel in it I’m a double right back
I’m a get up in these white christmas tree
Like a real one
