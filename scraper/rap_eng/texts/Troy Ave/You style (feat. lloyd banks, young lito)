See now I went to the club and I ran into this girl
And she was telling 'bout how she feel and everything
Her name was New York
But she said Troy listen
She said yo new shit pumpin', you make us so proud
We've been wantin' something this good for a while
But I'm not fooled by both them dimples on yo face
'Cause when we danced, I felt that fifth all on yo waist
And you know
She like my style, she like my flows
It ain't no chuck involved, she knows
I came so far from dealin' blow
Been on my grind and now it shows
Ain't nobody sound like this
We ain't the same, they rode that dick
Fuck them lames, get down with this
Pop champagne, girl shake yo hips
She got the long hair, ain't nothing fake
Flute glass full of birthday cake
All blue thong with the stars on it
Layin' in my bed and she all on it
Rewind back, before I grind the cat
Two steppin' in the club with my dogs all strapped
There for dough, playin' with the bitches
A flashy young nigga before we took the pictures
I can take ya number, can't be ya man
But you can act like it in ya Instagram
I like flippin' grams and you like me
And if you into getting money baby you like me
Come on, I'm out here, sound the alarm
I heard one good girl is worth a thousand whores
One good song is worth a thousand tours
So before I leave, proceed wit yo boy
She said yo new shit pumpin', you make us so proud
We've been wantin' something this good for a while
But I'm not fooled by both them dimples on yo face
'Cause when we danced I felt that fifth all on yo waist
And you know
She like my style, she like my flows
It ain't no chuck involved, she knows
I came so far from dealin' blow
Been on my grind and now it shows
Ain't nobody sound like this
We ain't the same, they rode that dick
Fuck them lames, get down with this
Pop champagne, girl shake yo hips
It's that NY sound, oh this that new NY sound
Puttin' it down for the town
I used to put them birds in and out of town
But look at me now
One brick at a time on the road to get mine
Spit about it in rhymes now the hustle combined
Pop I'm killin' these bitches I done stayed on my grind
Motivated by money and puttin' on time
To get busy, these other niggas been iffy
They callin' me young Jay, they call me the new 50
Call me what you want except broke, let's toast
Who the fuck I'm supposed to sound like, I'm from New York
Troy Ave got the streets in a frenzy though
I bought the spotlight back, you should thank me no
And if you don't, then we know you a hater bro
"A playa hater" Biggie quote
I'm on the radio baby everyday, that's my word
I restored the feeling, I kept up my word
The new sheriff in town, the chuck is over
BSB roll with us so you get rolled over
She said yo new shit pumpin', you make us so proud
We've been wantin' something this good for a while
But I'm not fooled by both them dimples on yo face
'Cause when we danced I felt that fifth all on yo waist
And you know
She like my style, she like my flows
It ain't no chuck involved, she knows
I came so far from dealin' blow
Been on my grind and now it shows
Ain't nobody sound like this
We ain't the same, they rode that dick
Fuck them lames, get down with this
Pop champagne, girl shake yo hips
