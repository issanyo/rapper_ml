[Chorus: Troy Ave]
You know what it is, when you see me riding through
Still ain't got no love for the other side
Lay a finger on any one of my crew, guaranty you it's a homicide
Runnin through the streets, that stuff in my shoe
Spending no money, but the whips brand new
Dope boys love me, and the bitches do too
You a hater, we still shitten on you

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I'm shittin on niggas, I'm from the north side
I'm up in the building, not sitting courtside
Jump in that water, you getting baptised
Fourced power, you share it, you get a Porsh ride
If you real, you know I'm fuckin with you
In the trap, where all the feends come through
And my dogs, we stick together like glew
We ball for all the shit we been through
Gotti just a street nigga, like you
Lamborghini doors up, my Coope
Gotti just a fly nigga, pursue
I told my homie Larry, if I don't make it to the top
Then you know I'm coming back to fuck with the block
No stones, only 50 grand in the watch
You reach for this hood chain, you get shot

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
You know what it is, when you see me riding through
Still ain't got no love for the other side
Lay a finger on any one of my crew, guaranty you it's a homicide
Runnin through the streets, that stuff in my shoe
Spending no money, but the whips brand new
Dope boys love me, and the bitches do too
You a hater, we still shitten on you

[Verse 2: Troy Ave]
I heard when I come to the block, they goin rob me
So when I came through, they see me, they just mob me
Pounds with the hugs, but I can see you just a fake
And I'm a real nigga, love outwaigh the hate
Sad cause you never gonna get up to doing racks
Sadder cause you never gonna get to moving crack
You gonna die broke in the hood, and that's a fact
You old and live with your mama, that crib packed
Name, DoDoDoDo, you pussy, you unsuccessful, P You
Used to be all in my feelings, like you
Now I'm in the forin with my millions, oo
[Chorus: Troy Ave]
You know what it is, when you see me riding through
Still ain't got no love for the other side
Lay a finger on any one of my crew, guaranty you it's a homicide
Runnin through the streets, that stuff in my shoe
Spending no money, but the whips brand new
Dope boys love me, and the bitches do too
You a hater, we still shitten on you
