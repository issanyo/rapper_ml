[Intro: Troy Ave]
BSB shit
Troy Ave, Young Lito
Easy as a free throw
Quab be on the beat, though
Powder


[Hook: Troy Ave]
Just give me that head (just give me that head)
[x2]
Ain’t got no time to open your legs
Girl, give me that head (girl, give me that head)

Just give me that head (just give me that head)
[x2]
Whether on the couch or on the bed
Girl, give me that head

Just give me that head (just give me that head)
[x2]
Ain’t got no time to open your legs
Just give me that head

Just give me that head (just give me that head)
[x2]
Whether on the couch or on the bed
Girl, give me that head

Sacrifice your bitch to me [x2]
It ain’t your mother, nigga you’ve got others
Won’t you sacrifice your bitch to me?
[x2]


[Verse 1: Young Lito]
At the club they swarm me
All these bitches be on me
Keep the name, I know the game
I just want some brain like a zombie
No Walking Dead, I don’t need no bed
Oh, you’re pussy good? I’ll take some head
Ain’t cuffin’ nothin’, I’m not a Fed
I’m ‘a take you down, or your friend instead
I am not an officer, when I’m done I am tossing yuh
To the curve, I know you heard
Now tell your friends, baby spread the word


[Hook: Troy Ave]


[Verse 2: Young Lito]
I just want head in a comfortable bed
It can all be so simple
I’m fly as a bitch and your body is thick
But girl I want your mental
When I’m done, you’re going back like a rental
Getting money, fucking niggas’ hoes ‘s what I’m into
Do you know how many niggas’ bitches that I’ve been through?
Young Lito’s running through these hoes like a [rent-thru?]
O.J. Simpson, my last name should be ‘Pimpin’’
Ask all the hoes that I’ve been in
Young Wave God, still swimming
They say that I’m fresh, they say I’m a mess
They’re texting my phone and they say I’m the best
They come to my shows and I cum on their chest
An eight to a ten, I don’t want nothing less


[Hook: Troy Ave]


[Outro]
Now, baby this is [the Lovey..?], baby
And I’m here, and I’m making a grand announcement
That I want you to get—all—the Tinderonis together
And let ‘em know, I want them to—sacrifice—themselves tonight, baby
Use your lips, hips and fingertips, baby
Sacrifice tonight!
See, I’m here to make sure you’re on the right track, player
BSB’s here to stand tall where y’all suckers gonna fall
Ya dig?
