[Pre-Hook: Troy Ave]
To the people who thought I was gonna flop
Ya'll a part of the reason I ain't gonna stop
Against the odds, I went hard until I popped
Came from the bottom and now I'm standing on top
I had dreams and now they all coming true
Put the team in them things, we got a few
Make a scene whenever I be coming through
If you hated just know I'm shitting on you

[Hook: Troy Ave]
Dooo di doooo dooo do do, dooo di doooo dooo do do
Dooo di doooo dooo do do, dooo di doooo dooo do do
You a hater just know I'm shitting on you
Dooo di doooo dooo do do, dooo di doooo dooo do do
Dooo di doooo dooo do do, dooo di doooo dooo do do
You a hater just know I'm shitting on you

[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
In the era where people front like who they not
I was fine with being me and movin' blocks
Started rapping about things we really got
First drag, I'm like fuck it I've been hot
From the city that make your heart so cold
For the stories that's gonna go untold
Tellin' time on my Rollie is so gold
Til my grind is motivation when you go

[Hook: Troy Ave]
Dooo di doooo dooo do do, dooo di doooo dooo do do
Dooo di doooo dooo do do, dooo di doooo dooo do do
You a hater just know I'm shitting on you
Dooo di doooo dooo do do, dooo di doooo dooo do do
Dooo di doooo dooo do do, dooo di doooo dooo do do
You a hater just know I'm shitting on you

[Verse 2: Troy Ave]
People always tell you what you can and what you can't do
I just get this money and I blow it like a candle
Wax paper full of dope, show you what the grams do
Last line was Lito, shout to my little man too
I'mma buy a 'Rari, I don't want this shit manual
Stick to my calligraphy, become a rap vandal
B$B Troy Ave, got the game handled
New young Shuttlesworth, Jesus in his sandals
Call me Sire, rolling like a tyre
You can't deny I got the streets on fire
Burn baby, burn, I went in to earn
And took mines,while the rest just waiting for they turn
That ain't right, and we ain't left, no one behind
Knowing while you was frontin' we took steps to be great
So as you move past the fake player hate
I'mma still be the man while they ain't, motherfuckers

[Pre-Hook: Troy Ave]
To the people who thought I was gonna flop
Ya'll a part of the reason I ain't gonna stop
Against the odds, I went hard until I popped
Came from the bottom and now I'm standing on top
I had dreams and now they all coming true
Put the team in them things, we got a few
Make a scene whenever I be coming through
If you hated just know I'm shitting on you

[Hook: Troy Ave]
Dooo di doooo dooo do do, dooo di doooo dooo do do
Dooo di doooo dooo do do, dooo di doooo dooo do do
You a hater just know I'm shitting on you
Dooo di doooo dooo do do, dooo di doooo dooo do do
Dooo di doooo dooo do do, dooo di doooo dooo do do
You a hater just know I'm shitting on you
