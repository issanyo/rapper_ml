[Chorus] [x2]
Was bout to buy a Rari, bought a tour bus
With that I get a Lambo wit' the doors up
Fuck could niggas tell me I ain't working
I see them niggas every time they hurtin
Passed a couple haters lookin stressed out
You can't have your hand and your chest out
What you tryin' to hold, huh, nigga, what
You can hold these shots you can hold these nuts

[Verse 1]
I got mad missions to accomplish
Runnin' through a bitch-nigga gauntlet
I can never stop, give me what you got
I ain't tryin' to hit like a bitch is on
Some niggas throw shots, but it don't matter
Cause when I throw shots bones shatter
Break 'em down, break 'em down, break 'em
I'm the real deal, niggas fakin'
Moment of silence, I'm 'bout to kill niggas
You're bitin' my style, I'm 'bout to bill niggas
Swagger jackin' at an all-time high
And I ain't really mad, I am that guy
A fisher with the fish scale, you a tuna
Little nigga I'm the big whale and the shooter
Violate I sent you to hell, oh, well, your L
Eleven thou in my pocket that I could throw in a fire
And I won't feel it cause, real shit, all my stacks gettin' higher
On the top pointin higher, on a roll like a Kaiser
Most these niggas' vagina, I'm lookin' 'round but don't find ya
Like, damn with these niggas that be so tough
My phone in my hand, nobody still ain't called my bluff
I got it off grams, these other rappers not so much
Not so much, the chuck is up, real nigga shit

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I just seen a lot of scary shit to these vintage flame flames
When I’m starting to get money starting
People starting to get strange strange
Got them six figures when i want in these mother fucker
This is not a game game
Glocks ease into you man quiet  kill you man ten ey
You don’t see rap nigga you dont get it no more
Let’s do my style while my squad got more
All my lyrics first hand they just write theirs short
Just got the girl of your dreams and i gave her lap jaw
I hope you never jealous keep your fake feet away
Tired of all the damn prison letters in the mail
We all in the game some advancing the faith
Shit ain’t balanced even where the digits scale
The dope boy swaggin big and they doing it dirty
Where a european kiss with an American jerk
She wake up on my dick I’m like damn it’s too early
Not to mention when they like nigga you girly
Fuck Chuck cause my feeling is good
I’m cumming up and it feels good
Been swagging plus real good
I’m a self made mother fucker and I’m still hood
Could have bought a whip but i bought a watch
I could fuck your bitch but i got the top
I could beat you niggers up but i had to drop it
But I ain’t in to the throwing punches I’ll be throwing shots
I be in all blue like a city cop
No badge just cash and a semi Glock
Free my nigga Lew Dollar and Pretty Oct
Before the dance I was known to make my millie rock

[Chorus]
