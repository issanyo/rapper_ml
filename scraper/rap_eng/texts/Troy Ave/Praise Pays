(Hook)
God is great and my paper's straight
The real relate while the fake gone hate
God is great and my paper's straight
The real relate while the fake gone hate
Thank you Jesus for giving me this guap
Thank you Jesus for everything I've got (I got I got I got)

(Verse 1)
Wake up every morning every day and I pray
Lord keep these sucker niggas out of my way
Seems like they always got something to say
Using they opinions in a negative way
I want to help with the pain but they voices remain silent
I'm thinking of ways every day to stop violence
Brothers quick to argue, pull a weapon off the dresser
Police doing worse, we don't put weapons on oppressors
Doing all these drugs got our brains in a fog
Can't escape reality you scared get a dog
Make sure the bark bigger than the bite
They don't respect you when you humble so fuck being polite
I used to be knocking out now I enter through a door
I kick it, I want it all people with nothing would say that I'm tricking
Fuck 'em all they comfortable with sad conditions
I want lavish living, I'm down to make a brash decision
And I'm ready for whatever consequence
I mean what I say and I say what I mean
And I'm ready for whatever consequence
I mean what I say and I say what I mean
God Bless!

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
Salvation is a gift for me
Why these niggas ain't down? They always want a lift from you
I ain't perfect but I try to do the right thing
I bought my little bro Rollie not a Breitling
