Mic check, mic check

BSB Records
We the number one independent label in the streets, I'm just telling you what it is and it is what I tell you

(Powder)

It's a drought and I'm getting some more [?] today
I'm the nigga with the weight, other niggas gotta wait
I'm make this work through magic before I sit it on the plate
Harry Potter nah Houdini all that's missing is a cape
When I'm in Rhode Island, all I'm hitting is the capes
[?] and them bitches get to the cake
Moving the type of sleeves that you don't roll down
And I don't love hoes so when I'm in town
One night only, after that they the homies
If they keep it trill I'm treating them like they trophies
Better yet a mule, bet I'm not a fool
If you ain't down to help me get no money then we ain't cool
Fuck fake friends, paid a buck for the Benz
Threw it on my album cover and I left the stock rims
Literally, picture me rolling on my 2Pac
You on the trap [?] nowhere

[Hook]
Nigga I'm a savage, nigga I'm a savage
Getting crazy paper, Count on weekends and it's madness
I'ma hit the bitch, even if the bitch is average
I'm just here to fuck, I ain't interested in marriage
Married to the game, different birds be my boo
BSB the game and cocaine get us through
The bad times, the good grind baby earn
Now everybody over here straight like a perm

If money's the root of evil then say I'm down the devil
Now on my arrival, smell like some [?]
Fuck the Pyrex [?] inhale
I love the aroma, you're other plug shit stale
[?]
My work is direct delete from Guatemala
Free shipping, free chicken whipping dollars
M, O, capital B, feel free to holla'
If you ain't talking money too, the fuck you talking 'bout
My women ride Range Rovers and GPS they routes
On the road to riches
Unimpressed by pictures
To get her pussy wet you gotta start with six figures
Or better seven
Step your shit up get a ladder
I stepped on bricks, now I'm up
Sitting with the ladder
I'm just telling you what it is and it is what I tell you
Dope boy, Troy Ave my flow crazier than [?]

Nigga I'm a savage, nigga I'm a savage
Getting crazy paper, Count on weekends and it's madness
I'ma hit the bitch, even if the bitch is average
I'm just here to fuck, I ain't interested in marriage
Married to the game, different birds be my boo
BSB the game and cocaine get us through
The bad time, the good grind baby earn
Now everybody of here straight like a perm
