[VERSE 1] YOUNG LITO
See I hear them talking about it but they ain't ever got it
See me I go and get it being broke is not an option
Had this profit, get the money divide it on the average
Stretch it till it flips called that shit gymnastics
Thses niggas living savage turn my paper into plastic
Getting money just hobby, bank accounts is just a habit
Cause me i gotta have it all, looking at the bigger picture rip the frame up off the wall
Im the one these bitches call cause homie I make it happen
I don't rub my hands together my nigga i get it clapping
And I ain't into acting but they call me Samuel Jackson
Leave these bitches in suspense but Im all about that action
And we dealing on the facts you can try me if you want really ain't no coming back
Stupid nigga tryna front playing with my green imma roll up like a blunt
Head cracked then I split him down the middle like a dutch

[HOOK] TROY AVE

Im a dope young nigga thats known for getting these racks

Rocking European fits fly like Delta came a long way from that hamburger helper
Know we in Friscos drinking Cris like its seltzer
Water but im on fire bitch i might melt-ya
Feeling like Im next started from the projects now Im in the studio recording with Wyclef
After that business back whipping in the pyrex
Cause I love the hoes but money makes my eyes stretch
Money is my mindset niggas say I changed
But I ain't hustle this hard to stay the same
