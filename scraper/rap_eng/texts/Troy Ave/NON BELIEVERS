[Intro Reign ]
What it look like Troy
Its crazy how this games become
A bunch of haters and non believers
And fake gangsters and don divas
But you know we going to keep doing are thing and we going  Rideout  you feel me (RO)

[hook  1: Reign]

Where you now that you see us at the top (hater)

These clown ass niggers praying that we flop
Cuz  they  see us in those drops and they know we won't stop Where you now that you see us at the top (hater)
Its ok i love hip hop
These clown ass niggers praying that we flop
Cuz  they  see us in those drops and they know we won't stop

[Verse 1: Reign]

Struggle and pain brought plenty to gain
Switch lanes up on these niggas cuz my drive is insane
You thought i went and won the lotto how i don't be with small change
Yeah i do  it for the riches y'all here for the fame
Can't complain about riches
When you only think bitches
Monopolies my style now I'm seeing digits
Four course meals , trips down in brazil
Bad mami with the body cooler than windchill
Ice pick reign sharper then switch blades
Getting money never bummy  since the first grade
Taught from OG's how to get paid
Rain , sleet , snow its all about the cake
All the m's if you want a bendz
I heard what drake said but i need new friends
Scenery on the trops watches that match the drop
Champagne diamonds we shooting for the top (ro)

[hook 2: Reign]

Where you now that you see us at the top (hater)

[Verse 2 :Troy Ave]

I love hip hop
Thats my walk with the Glock
Shooting for the stars down to shoot it at the cops
Read and blue hit the stage over top
Bitches at the bottom say my words grab my cock
At the same damn time Troy ave is the future
They want me to recite lines from (troy ave is the future)
Hear now ease the crowed the weed is loud
When you see me in magazines with g and g be proud (thats my man)
Xxl i floss  big the source for all this
Dope shit conspiracy charge when i record hits
Out the parking lot you know THAT its foreign
Next time I'm in London you know that  its Lauren
The wizard is scoring mike jordan in 03
When I'm balling my jersey reads  A.V.E
Bsb we the commission sharper then an incision
Play the cut with the bottles up champagne nigga what
