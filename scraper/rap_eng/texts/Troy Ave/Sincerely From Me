I'm dreaming of a White Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be White

(Hook)
Merry Christmas homie you ain't get shit
Luckily for you I came through with this gift
Happy Holidays!
Play this in your whip, play it in your crib, I don't care just play this shit
I made it for you, sincerely from me!
White Christmas 3!
I made it for you, sincerely from me!
White Christmas 3!

(Verse 1)
It's 5AM my jeans cost five hundred
Had a S550 that I sold cause I ain't want it
Now I ride through the hood in a red coupe there he go!
I'm a wolf in Timberlands like Rubio!
He really don't play me neither, only time I play is out a real nigga speaker
Only time I play is at the truck with the jesus
My lil' man mother man she be holding my heater
It's cold so we're wearing full length furs
Even my baby boy in chinchillas
Fuck peter, car seater in a bucket seater
Car of mine is styling on all you dick eaters!

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
They tryin' to crucify me like Christ
But they ain't know I'm living life right
The lord hear my prayers every night
My ladder of success made of dynamite
I'm blowing up, blowing up
Blowing smoke at these niggas they hoeing up
That's why the fuck nothing's said they showing up
Man, you a mothafucking pussy, nigga what!?
PRICE IS GOING UP!

(Hook)
