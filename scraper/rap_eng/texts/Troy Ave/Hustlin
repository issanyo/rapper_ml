[Intro: Kev the Pope]
In this lil town of mines, called Brownsville
You was either gettin' money or you was broke
And if you was broke, you was never mentioned
So I'm gettin' money

[Hook: Kev the Pope]
Came from drug dealin', thug livin', gun killin'
I be out here every day, that's the life when you hustlin'
Came from drug dealin', thug livin', gun killin'
I be out here every day, that's the life when you hustlin'
Came from drug dealin', thug livin', gun killin'
I be out here every day, that's the life when you hustlin'
Came from drug dealin', thug livin', gun killin'
I be out here every day, that's the life when you hustlin'

[Verse 1: Kev the Pope]
Ain't sleep for 3 days, I ain't even take a shower
But I got what you need, want that molly or that dour?
You could catch me on them back blocks, gotta stay low
'Cause the fans run and take snap shots
Who that comin' down the block?
Oh my God, it's Shaniqa
Big booty, gold diggin' bitch
And her man is a skeezer
Remember when I had her in the bando
With her friend Felicia
She gave head like a grandma
Felt like she had no teeth, bruh
But Shaniqa, she always tryna pay a nigga short
Gimme eight for a dime
Talkin' 'bout I need to buy some Newports
I'm like, "Bitch, fuck you thought?"
'Cause it's money on my mind
And I ain't got no time to waste on no broke bitch
So if you ain't got it, you can dip
'Cause I ain't with the long talkin' shit
And I ain't with the long walks and shit
So here's a fare exchange, you can suck my dick

[Hook: Kev the Pope]
Came from drug dealin', thug livin', gun killin'
I be out here every day, that's the life when you hustlin'
Came from drug dealin', thug livin', gun killin'
I be out here every day, that's the life when you hustlin'
Came from drug dealin', thug livin', gun killin'
I be out here every day, that's the life when you hustlin'
Came from drug dealin', thug livin', gun killin'
I be out here every day, that's the life when you hustlin'

[Verse 2: Troy Ave]
Yo boy, king Troy, they labelled me a menace
Back and forth in court, nigga, I ain't playin' tennis
Fuckin' government get shunned, give a nigga sentence
Shit is too fake, I should get the Migos dentist
Pull them foreigns out, 6 figures on the curb
I came through shows as a singer, so I'm slingin' birds
If you a hater, middle finger, I flip them the bird
Desert Eagle, leave you like my foreign on the curb
This is my reality, cocaine, I traffic
Speak many the times like[?]
I stay out in Paris, I ain't talkin' 'bout my views
I'm talkin' 'bout bein' out hustlin' in my Loub's
I ran to clear a nigga, don't stay in the way
Business boomin', bags in black, back from the day
This little white of mine, I had to let it grind
Dope boy, Troy, nigga

[Hook: Kev the Pope]
Came from drug dealin', thug livin', gun killin'
I be out here every day, that's the life when you hustlin'
Came from drug dealin', thug livin', gun killin'
I be out here every day, that's the life when you hustlin'
Came from drug dealin', thug livin', gun killin'
I be out here every day, that's the life when you hustlin'
Came from drug dealin', thug livin', gun killin'
I be out here every day, that's the life when you hustlin'
