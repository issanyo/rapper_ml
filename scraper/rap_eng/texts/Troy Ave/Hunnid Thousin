[Intro: Rico Love]
If a nigga hatin' on you, don't stunt on that nigga, stunt on his bitch
She the one that's gonna wake up every day and tell him he ain't shit, and

[Verse 1: Rico Love]
I might spend a hundred thousand dollars on my bitch tonight
When you see me ballin', it's like kryptonite
And you ain't even Superman, you ain't even Clark, nigga
Hop up out my shit and leave it runnin', I don't park, nigga
Bet they leave my shit there, bet they leave my shit there
Real nigga and I'm rich, man, that shit rare
Phantom lookin' like a Winnebago
All my neighbors think I'm sellin' yayo
All these niggas wit' me on the payroll
My junior been a millionaire since a day old
Might be singin' to yo' bitch but I ain't soft though
If you see my crib, you think it's CostCo
Cause everything bigger than the regular
Don't scream my name, just call me on the cellular

[Hook: Rico Love]
I might spend a hundred thousand dollars on my bitch tonight
I might spend a hundred thousand dollars on my bitch tonight
Most these niggas only mad at me cause they broke
But if they knew like I knew, they'd be out here gettin' dough
So I'mma spend a hundred thousand dollars on my bitch tonight
Turn the lights on

[Verse 2: Moonie Da Hustla]
Hundred thousand dollars on yo' bitch tonight
I'll turn a broke bitch rich tonight
And this Hublot on my wrist is light
With a new foreign, baby, this the life
Got money in mattress, nigga, feel millions of asses, nigga
Put yo' bitch [?] and now she on the masses, nigga
Used to serve that off-white, you was wearing pyrex
I was with the plug, I was gettin' it from him direct
Dope boy, pull up in that Lamborghini Convoy
Even my bitch be ballin' on 'em like a tomboy
Ooh, am I smellin' like I'm fresh up out a bank for?
Runnin' through this check, boy, like this shit a cake walk
Real talk, just a ghetto nigga in some Thom Browne
And you ain't even relevant, calm down
Came from the gutter so what you expect?
Puttin' supermodels in that [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Troy Ave]
I'mma spend a hundred thousand dollars on my bitch tonight
She the same one that made me half a mill so it's aight
Baby, here's a Maserati, show it to your folks
Don't be shy, tell 'em I got it off the coke
Ironically, I'm poppin' too so the money flippin'
Lotta luggage tags but we ain't never trippin'
Fuckin' maggot, papers and birthday cake, different flavors
They still pourin', you rich by yourself, you ain't need no favors
Cause the worst thing is when you got a O
You gon' be at your best when you got the dough, you already snow
Rollie coke, bezel below, see the goodie glow
On the road to success, cashin' like [?]
Ain't no easy pass for us hustlers, it's the life we chose
We just takin' it bout our net worth, accomplishing goals
It's you on the football but never get the score, buddy
Tell me, if they losin', how would they eat pork? They not

[Hook]
