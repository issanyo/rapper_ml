[Hook:]
Didn't have a gun in my seat, smoking a blunt in peace
I'm a touch a ho or two
I be runnin the streets, dippin and dodge the police
We know the buzz in blue
And I be ready to freak, to roll around in the sheets
I do it good, yo booish
If you don't grind you don't eat
It ain't my style to be beat
I'm supercool, igloo

[Verse:]
Somebody killed the coroner
It's gon need a body bag
If I can be the foreigner damn this bitch body-bagged
Gotta sip the Kool-Aid, gotta watch and who play
She don't like scotch, she a rather people movie
I'll need a pen, so swole up blunt
Smack her on her ass, you say bitch go and roll a blunt
Got her in the chains from the get, I ain't gon front
Wanna speak cash but the trick, I'm just gon front
Preachers â€“ I don't pay them
Pass the fuckin bacon
Sorta hit the coldest year for my paid attention
The game maybe so, I'm just giving you a sample
Never frontin when you front
Don't get more than you can handle

[Hook:]
Didn't have a gun in my seat, smoking a blunt in peace
I'm a touch a ho or two
I be runnin the streets, dippin and dodge the police
We know the buzz in blue
And I be ready to freak, to roll around in the sheets
I do it good, yo booish
If you don't grind you don't eat
It ain't my style to be beat
I'm supercool, igloo
