[Verse 1]
Dope boy, Troy Ave, young hot nigga
You see me, you see the apple, I am Motts nigga
Different sauce, see me floss, red drop nigga
16 in the mag, one in top nigga
Murder ain’t a thang but a hip reach
Money ain't a thang but a quick meet
Fast life living, dicking dip freaks
BSB records, we the new street
Still watch it, I ain’t quote Jigga
Shabazz [?] 300, Wade switched the figures
Shouts to GS9, BK niggas
I love my cities shine, you see the way I glitter
VVS, my [?] neck in my hands
Major deal advance sitting in my pants
Pockets so heavy I just take a stance
Two stepping, let my diamonds do the Shmoney dance
[?], honor roll, hustlers relate
Count a quarter mil, making sure the numbers straight
187s hit, keep the 848
I give a niggga the chills just like my Rolex face
No ticks but some hating suckers
Sitting in the nosebleeds yelling shit, fuck it
Free John, free Rum, free J O
Can’t forget killer out there, all them niggas yayo
Caught a body 20 weeks ago
A day off, but them people know
My gun warm I will heat the four
But let me get back to this kitchen, whipping, eating blow
