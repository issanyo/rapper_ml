[Intro: Young Lito]
All I want is your forgiveness, God is my witness
I love you more than kids love Christmas
I need you, nothin’ else on my wish list
You know I used to work you out like fitness


[Bridge: Troy Ave]
Flex baby, flex
Flex, workout with good sex
Flex baby, flex
Flex, workout with good sex


[Verse : Young Lito]
Look, I cheated
I admit it, I cheated
But not with nobody I really wanted to be with
And you was doin’ your thing too, it ain’t a secret
But girl when I gave you my heart
You was supposed to keep it
But instead you gave it back
Now you’ve got me like a maniac
I’ve got a lot of women, but I want my baby back
See I still can’t accept you gone
And when my world got cold, girl you kept me warm
Now I’m getting drunk, missing you
Thinkin’ ‘bout dissing you
Pissed at the fact I no longer mean shit to you
Not only a lover, I lost a friend
But if you took me back, shit I’d probably do it again
I was a good king, damn where did my queen go?
I’m off, now I’m feeling like Nemo, I’m lost
Look, a nigga tough, but I’m not no machine, yo
And right now I’m sick like a nigga in chemo (I’m goin’ through it)
Bingo, girl my chips are down
Can you please just forgive me now?
I find myself just staring at your pictures now
I think about you even when chicks around


[Hook: Young Lito]
In the future, babe do you see me?
(Do you see us together?)
Well, I love you, do you believe me?
(Tell me you believe me)
You promised you’ll never leave me
(Baby don’t go!)
Who said this breakup shit is easy?
Man it ain’t easy!
[x2]


[Outro: Young Lito]
Listen, all I want is your forgiveness
God is my witness
I love you more than kids love Christmas
I want you, nothing else on my wishlist
You know I used to work you out like fitness
Endless love is what we used to have
‘Member we used to fight, fuck and then we’d laugh
It feels just like my life sucks, I’ve got it bad
Damn, love is a drag, shit hurts just like a stab
