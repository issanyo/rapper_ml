[Intro]
May not sell out, make friends then
Fuck the other side though, you heard?
Bang

[Chorus]
Can't stop trappin', I'm on go
Niggas John Madden, yeah I know
My mink jacket to the floor
Cold weather, moonwalkin' in the snow
Might go to jail but I'll be home soon
Before me leave, haffa hit you with a dope chune
Can't stop trappin', I'm on go
Niggas John Madden, yeah I know

[Verse]
Hail Mary, for the greats
'Cause I'm rich, fuck nigga, fix your face
Broke fuckin' broker, joke fuckin' joker
Fifty thousand for my Cuban, twenty for my choker
Fucked your baby mom, she love when I choke her
Fucked this rap nigga's bitch, she love when I throat her
I'm a real nigga so I ain't doin' exposin'
But she be suckin' like a character from Bram Stoker
Count Dracula, you know what that's about
Countin' money, draggin' fur, that's a fact about
Dope Boy Troy Ave, dog, no Hoya
My GT guy neat, call it Diane Sawyer

[Chorus]
Can't stop trappin', I'm on go
Niggas John Madden, yeah I know
My mink jacket to the floor
Cold weather, moonwalkin' in the snow
Might go to jail but I'll be home soon
Before me leave, haffa hit you with a dope chune
Can't stop trappin', I'm on go
Niggas John Madden, yeah I know
