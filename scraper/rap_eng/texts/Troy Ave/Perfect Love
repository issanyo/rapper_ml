The bst the team turn the role turn the

Even way that i rap, get it and right

And the men told me
Stay up and ‘over time you’ll be mercy
That whole rap game, chilling my nigga
Being stick to the ‘
Write and ‘through my song and ‘
Stay nigga keep loyalty nigga
Don’t ever let these wh*r*s and don’t never hate nigga
Be careful where are my ..had to feed a fake nigga
Looking in that ‘see me? i’m a bad nigga
On my shelter’i do hustle
…and a clean with the bubble
This cowboy’

Starting with those'
It’s probably to those people how i represent them all
We got perfect love together
We got perfect love together
