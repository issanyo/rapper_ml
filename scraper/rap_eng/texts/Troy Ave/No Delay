[Hook]
It ain't no delay on these racks
It ain't no delays, I react
Niggas put a blade in my bag
I pull it out and bled, now I'm back
It ain't no delay on these racks
It ain't no delays, I react
Niggas put a blade in my bag
I pull it out and bled, now I'm back

[Verse 1]
Sittin' in the crib in a chair
They monitor my moves cause they scared
I'm moving with a pistol, beware
I'm shooting at his limbs and his head
Movin' like a bitch, I'm aware
One of you bitches snitched, so I'm here
Y'all gon' see in court who a bear
But I can see it crystally clear
Stones on me crystally clear
VVS' ain't the crystal you wear
See the kitty purr when I'm near
See me in the fur or the clear

[Hook]
It ain't no delay on these racks
It ain't no delay on these racks
Niggas put a blade in my bag
I pull it out and bled, now I'm back
It ain't no delay on these racks
It ain't no delays, I react
Niggas put a blade in my bag
I pull it out and bled, now I'm back

[Verse 2]
Sliding in a Masi or a Bach
Going where these fake niggas can't
Real nigga tell 'em what I'm with
Real nigga tell it on my wrist
Weak niggas stay tryna diss
But after real shots, eat a dick
Shoot the fucking braids of your hair
Stripper bitches in my place giving head
I heard they bring my name up a lot
It happens when you came up a lot
I had to cook up 'cain up a lot
We should all see our prayers or Salat
To the sky, no ceiling just the sky
Looking through these red nigga eyes
Real eyes, realize real lies
Cut the ties, getting bread flipping pies

[Hook]
It ain't no delay on these racks
It ain't no delay on these racks
Niggas put a blade in my bag
I pull it out and bled, now I'm back
It ain't no delay on these racks
It ain't no delays, I react
Niggas put a blade in my bag
I pull it out and bled, now I'm back
