[Intro: Tak]
This shit'll bust a nigga
I don't think you understand where it is we come from
I'm talkin' about nothin' nigga
No money in our pockets and the refrigerator's empty
Now it's lobster and steak and zero mileage on the Bentleys
We comin' for niggas' spots man
We ain't never settlin' for this shit

[Hook: Troy Ave]
Lights camera action (say cheese)
I'm flashy and cashin' (moneys)
Greedy women lappin'
It's the laws of attraction (powder)
Lights camera action (say cheese)
I'm flashy and cashin' (moneys)
Greedy women lappin'
It's the laws of attraction (powder)
Gettin' dough (powder)
Pure and slow (powder)
You already know (powder)

[Verse 1: Maino]
I was born a king
I'ma die a god
My tattoos tell a story that's behind my scars
Hangin' out of the phantom screamin' the world is ours
Fell asleep then I woke up inside a m√©nage
Dream chasin' these bitches beggin' for penetration
Niggas hatin' but they really just want me to save 'em
Can't take it, these niggas ain't really who they claim
These boys different, they club snitchin' who can I blame?
Ghetto baby I had to make it with few choices
Now I'm posin' for pictures standin' on Rolls-Royces
I was chosen, money throwin', these strippers open
[?] golden
King of Brooklyn, killas love me, thugs salute me
Got some old school shooters that call they hammers toolies
My life a movie, lights cameras and action
You think it's rap til my homie pass me the Mac-10

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I was born a slave
I'ma die a king
Red beams bout that ass then it's badda bing
I heard niggas talkin' [?] not a thing
Whippin' white like I'm tryna get revenge for Rodney King
In the kitchen whippin' up the yams 'til the stove break
Pistol whip a nigga with the seven 'til the nose break
You ain't never turned a made man into a closed case
Headshot, blow his brains out, rip his whole face
Momma can't identify
Dreamchasers enterprise
Nigga this the genocide
Kids lettin' semis fly
I did this shit too many times
Put me on any side
I'm makin' niggas minimize
Mac hit em fifty times, whoa!

[Hook]
