Blessed

I am blessed and highly favored
Favor in fear
So how dare you
How dare you hate
I take no credit
All glory belongs to God
Blame God
The blessings of the Lord maketh one rich
Nope, I'm not ashamed
In fact, I've been change'
The chain has been broken
I was broken
But one touch from my savior Jesus Christ
Changed my life, my life
We'll never ever be the same
I thank God I'm free
The bloods, the words
The power of prayer still works
I'm alive and doin' well
I am blessed
