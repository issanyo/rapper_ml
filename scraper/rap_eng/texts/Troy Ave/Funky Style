I got the funky funky style with some funky rap
I’m smoking funky funky loud in the funky trap
My bitches never fuck around, keep ’em coming back
And every time I put it down, police, I’m out

[Verse 1]
My young niggas overseas, triple beam dreams (word)
I’m drinkin’ 40s with my shawties, like to call ’em queens (work)
And she ain’t fuckin’ with paparazzis in limousines
I like to eat the pussy, mommy, keep the pussy clean
I’m smokin’ dope for no disclosure with my older girl
She always think she teachin’ me, she think she know the world
I went and spent 100k
I had to show the girl
All this money you really seein’
You thinkin’ you dreamin’
Aband’ apartments, we was starvin’
That was real life I dream of killin’ my enemy
Think I still might
But every time I grip the mic, I see the life
A lotta checks, a lotta sex, and bright lights

[Verse 2]
Alright, alright, I got a funky funky style
Out of tape for smokin’ it loud
I’ll be quiet, just go pout, be concealed
Just like a vial of crack, red top yo hat, if red on my beam
Nothing seen, that’s a fact
Murder was the case, it’s coated in my heart
I keep swarm in the firth, or the Porsche
I pushed off Stop and get hurt and she just wanna stall
Pull down my zipper to the point, like a dawg
I see they buzz out, I ain’t buzz shit
She was on vast so a nigga couldn’t get in
See me out, I be Will Smith-in’
Makin’ movies in the club, but, now I’m fiction
This Benz got you dissin’
