[Sample]
...And I want the rest of you cowboys to know something, there's a new sheriff in town

[Verse  1]
Give me two months, I’ll be famous as fuck
I said that two months ago while I was smoking blunts
Now I’m getting a massage, half Brazilian broad
Ass so fat, I feel like it’s a Menage
Hazel colored eyes, damn this chick fine
She feeling on me, I’m feeling the birthday cake rhyme
With my system in my cup, missionary fuck
Backshots, hand Glocks, man I switch it up
Like the flow-go, I did it do-lo, flew solo
Birdman not from no-do, no flow though, self made, self paid
ESP records, established in these streets through hard work, y’all respect it

[Pre-Hook] (x2)
Put em up, put em up, put em up
Put it up, put it up, put it up
What’s up? Okay, bitch shut up
Eight weeks ‘til famous, sixty days ‘til my name
Eight weeks ‘til I fuck the world, sixty days ‘til I bang
(Famous as fuck, mmm)

[Hook] (x2)
I worked hard for this, fought and fuckin’ bled for this
Carried through and broke myself in half for this
Crashed through every door that shut, oh
Give me two months and I’ll be famous as fuck, oh

[Outro 1]
Famous as fuck in two months, broken, Pink Grenade will be the biggest act out, fact, two months

[Hook]

[Outro 2]
(Famous as fuck, yeah, muthafucka)
(Famous, famous as fuck, oh)
(Famous as fuck, muthafucka)
