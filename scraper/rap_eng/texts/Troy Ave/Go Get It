[Hook – Troy Ave & Young Dolph]
Real niggas first, fake niggas last
Till I’m in the dirt, I’ma get this cash
You hating cause you hurting, all I do is laugh
I grind and I work, all you do is act
All that I know is go get it, all that I know is go get it
I went and got me a new bitch and left my old bitch all in her feelings, damn
All that I know is go get it, all that I know is go get it
I wrap this shit up and I sent it, riding around in coupes in the city
All that I know is go get it, I told her I just want to feel it
Lit the purple, let her hit it
She lift her skirt up, let me in it
All that I know is go get it, all that I know is go get it
I only keep family with me, and all that they know is go get it

[Verse 1 – Young Dolph]
That’s all I do is go get it, young south Memphis hippy
Rolling up that sticky, in the coupe with your ho with me
90 round my neck and that Rolex it hit me 60
I made myself a boss, these diamonds got no floss
She get in my car with panties, I make her take them off
He come between me and my cake I got to pick him off
I heard my dog was snitching, I had to shake him off
Got tired of my bitch bitching so I had to cut her off
I felt that world and got it, so I took a trip
Every pack I get I get a gallon just to sip
If I fuck her guarantee that pussy get killed
Don’t ask me that, you know the difference between me and them

[Verse 2 – Troy Ave]
All I know is go get it, whenever you see me I look like paid
I go out and I get it, nigga you don’t even know what to say
Fuck looking around high and low, my fire’s low and I’m frying blow
Birdman but no Emmitt O, I got birds man, I mean plenty hoes
Buy a bitch a purse, she carry coke in that bag
I’m bout my business first, only second to getting that cash
Run up get gunned down, sun up to sun down
Counting paper, these [?] haters get thumbed down
It’s sad but true, I’m self made and I’m self paid
Nigga what the fuck can you do, I wear swimming trunks cause I got the wave
Drop top cause I got the weight, prezzy shine like JFK
Just from kilos is how I got my greatest pay
