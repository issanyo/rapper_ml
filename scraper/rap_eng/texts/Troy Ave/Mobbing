[Intro: Papoose (Troy Ave)]
Real niggas, we back in style!

[Hook: Papoose]
50 deep in the club, homie, we mobbing (We mobbing!)
Stick-up kids with me, killas with me, we mobbing (Mobbing!)
Fuck a guest list, we gon' mob regardless
M-O-B-B-I-N-G, we mobbing! (Yeah!)

Homies from every set with me, we mobbing (What!)
Balenciagas, bitches in red bottoms
M-O-B-B-I-N-G, we mobbing!
(There is no God but you)

[Verse 1: Papoose]
Fuck who niggas out here buzzing, I'm 'bout to buzz with 'em
Yeah, they say his cousin be bugging, well hit his cuz with him!
Mollies make 'em feel like they tough, he got them drugs in him
Lead shower, bloodbath, he in the tub with 'em!
Heard his girl riding and dying, she in love with him
They say only God can judge, she getting judged with him (Damn!)
Sensitive thugs need hugs, I don't fuck with 'em
Right after I hug 'em I slug 'em, you could get hugged with 'em
On that Bobby Schmurda shit, homie, I grew up illing
Ever since I been in fifth grade, man, I been drug dealing
Niggas trying to tell me to chill, motherfuck chilling
If he tell you to chill, then he ain't got no thug in him!
Her shoes be red bottom like she got blood in 'em
Stomp a mudhole in your ass, put some mud in him
You be gettin high with them dudes, smoking bud with 'em
But you never eat with them niggas, why you don't grub with 'em?

[Verse 2: Troy Ave]
Mobbing, "money over bitches" be the motto
Made mines gambling my freedom, what's a lotto
Jackpot when you got crack spots?  Protect mines
Hop out with two nines like jackpots, really nigga!
Young willing nigga working toward a milli, nigga
If you ain't about that paper, you don't fuckin' feel me, nigga!
Blew 50K in the summer, word to my mother
Before we bought the Benz or that Hummer, we bought that butter!
Mellie took the oil then you hit it with that cold
I was using microwaves in hotels that ain't have stoves
I'm a H-U-S-T-L-E-R, hustler
No tolerance for silly hoes and bustas
But I still moves, BSB, you can trust us
Troy Ave bringing the city its due justice
No peace, except on the car, you see the sign?
Gold piece flooded in stone, you see me shine?
