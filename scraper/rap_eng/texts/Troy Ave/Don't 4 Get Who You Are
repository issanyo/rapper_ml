[Chorus]
Don't forget who you are, don't forget who you are
(Don't forget who you are)
Don't forget who you are, don't forget who you are
(Don't forget who you are)
Don't forget who you are, don't forget who you are
(Don't forget who you are)
Don't forget who you are, don't forget who you are
(Don't forget who you are)

[Verse 1]
He grew up with two parents in the house
Who provided him with his way out?
Went to private school unlike them other fools who was uneducated and took the dummy route
Went from watching crimes out the window to participating
Lights smoking indigo with some knuckleheads
Instead of tryna elevate, he getting high off some next shit not even thinking straight
Used to save [?]
[?]
Using daddy's car, used a getaway driver
Everything was running smooth til' that one with no survivors
On a high speed chase panicked look on his face
