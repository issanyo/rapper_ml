[Intro:]
Yea
Ahuh
Mash it down a lil bit

[Hook:]
People all over the world love bands
Get your hustle on, more bands
People all over the world, love bands
It's the money song

[Verse 1:]
Since the shorty had her 40 just before I knew her then
Hurled an ounce until he so he stash it by the garbage cans
I was 15 the first I had a shot at it
My homie Mull got reason, I just got to fight it
I'm yelling fuck the police with my yellow gold teeth
(I love it!) Took a bite out a crumb then I ate the whole piece
I'm committed like a priest, touching boys with the heat
Hottest nigga on the streets, rock a brick or rock a beat
Hot tops on my feet, I appoint all my hit
I appoint tell my bitch, high as fuck burning splish
Now the weed got me barrel-rolled, whole shot of Cabargo
People watch that business with, say you ain't no rapper tho
If they tell these jail conspiracies interventions
All it takes is to a nigga come get you up off these streets
That's a jewel, I be dropping em, gon shine
I'm a keep on the grind, it's coming in due time
Pause!

[Hook: x2]
People all over the world love bands
Get your hustle on, more bands
People all over the world, love bands
It's the money song, get more bands

[Verse 2:]
Brooklyn zoo, no RZA
Fame song by JZA
Wu Tang Clan, Jamaican nigga sizzla
Dry cut, ye ours then switch up
Dirty red wine cup, Merlot sipper
In the park with er, in the box with er
That's the ball clays, every day see my picture frame
Stay humble, stay working, stay getting richer
State now paying for love, you love the rental
Hoes gon be hoes but that's good with this
I'm tryina here to press hoes in 2003
I mean 7: 30, 6 O's but I style for free
Unique one and a bit powerful, ya know what I be cause:

[Hook: x2]
People all over the world love bands
Get your hustle on, more bands
People all over the world, love bands
It's the money song, get more bands
