[Intro:]
Powder
Troy Ave
Powder
Uh, alright alright

[Hook:]
I'm a dope young nigga that made a killing with blocks
And I be strapped every day, with my revolver or Glock
You hear a nigga that play, you hear that nigga got shot
BSB deal yay place your and cop
Fuck the cops, yeah that's how I feel
And fuck rap too, I'm major without a deal, for real
I'm getting money publicly, all my homies sucker free
Fly bitches love a G, real niggas fuck with me

[Verse 1:]
I'm representing the grind where niggas dead over time
I'm repping running these streets and you can see it by miles
I look and sound like New York, right now that's real hard to find
How you don't see I'm the talk, nigga the fuck is you blind
I Stevie Wonder bout niggas, 3 words for y'all
(These Words)
Troy Ave that nigga, sweet and simple I ball
(Sweet and Simple)
But the game is dope and the caine is coke
People saying my quotes, my people spraying get smoked
I done front on some mamas, cause revenge is a promise
I never started no drama, but I be finished this karma
Better yet no karma, I like my beef well done
It's always fucked up the money, so I get back to the 1's

[Hook:]
I'm a dope young nigga that made a killing with blocks

Fuck the cops, yeah that's how I feel
And fuck rap too, I'm major without a deal, for real
I'm getting money publicly, all my homies sucker free
Fly bitches love a G, real niggas fuck with me

[Verse 2:]
Big car, big jewels, I ain't ghetto
Ok, see the young nigga balling
Living but I'm talking, criminal recorded
I be in the chopper semi or revolver
Pati bought a portion, then he bought a Porsche
Hit me on the phone saying cousin you on flossing
My niggas do it big, some of them doing big
Until my hoes dead, I'm just tryina live
Pause, fill up the fridge, we eating over here
Champagne toasting, drink it like it's beer
Tomorrow ain't promised, the present is a gift
So am I appreciate all this gangster shit

[Hook:]
I'm a dope young nigga that made a killing with blocks
And I be strapped every day, with my revolver or Glock
You hear a nigga that play, you hear that nigga got shot
BSB deal yay place your order and cop
Fuck the cops, yeah that's how I feel
And fuck rap too, I'm major without a deal, for real

Fly bitches love a G, real niggas fuck with me

[Verse 3]
Money green I get my vegan on
Dealing with birds drive down and get my eagle on
See me getting served back and forth, got my Serena on
Tennessee titan PL with the heater on
Now I'm eating Chicharr√≥n yellow beans rice
Drinking Presidente with my plug talking bout price
Nigga talk about life, he asked me bout the music
I told him it's aight, just cost me a lot to do it
I ask about his wife
He told me never get married
The bitch caught me cheating and made me buy her a Audi
I told him God damn my girl cool with her first chick
His head shook my hands switch bags, Disappeared
True story

[Hook:]
I'm a dope young nigga that made a killing with blocks
And I be strapped every day, with my revolver or Glock
You hear a nigga that play, you hear that nigga got shot
BSB deal gang place your all damn cops
Fuck the cops, yeah that's how I feel
And fuck rap too, I'm major without a deal, for real
I'm getting money perfectly, all my homies sucker free
Fly bitches love a G, real niggas fuck with me

[Outro:]
Yea
The highest quality of street music is right here
And this is all facts, I don't make this shit up
You lookin for the anti-weirdo shit, anti-fuckboy shit? Shit that you could believe in?
You are in the right place
This is BSB records, I am Troy Ave
You niggas can't fuck with me, bitches wanna fuck me
