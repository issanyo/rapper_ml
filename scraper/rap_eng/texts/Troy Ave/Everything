[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Uh
Dope boy swag to the max on 'em
Dealing yay for the pay with the strap on 'em
Money ain't a thing but a quick meet
Nigga murder ain't a thing but a hip reach
BK nigga and I've been what's up
Word to my mother I don't give a fuck
Like a fronting ho
I ain't fronting though
I ain't gotta make a call I just dump and go
Fast lane living shit I'm in the streets
And you can feel that when I get a beat
D-town raps you can see my sheet
I've been toting gats since I had the peach
Fuzz lit, thug shit
New York City crack house drug shit
That's what the fuck I'm representing
30 cash for the cross what the fuck am I repenting nigga?

[Hook: Troy Ave]
Yea, I'm selling birds come and get a wing
BSB in the hood we the Medellín
I'm all good wearing heavy bling
Niggas front we putting holes up in everything, everything, everything
My niggas putting holes up in everything, everything, everything
My niggas putting holes up in everything

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Niggas who ain't selling no records look defeated
No shades on in the club, clothes repeated
Since '02 I told you I ain't need it
Billie Jean step on the square tell you to Beat It
Bricks in my backpack, scale and the black mac
Niggas don't talk on the phone, they can tap that
Unwrap raw, ice a tall mix
Once it shrink wrapped, mummify bricks
100 thousand dollar car minimums
And they're candy color coated like an m&m
Came with the bleach blonde bitch who love's eminem
And a tan on her skin like a Timberland
Everything nigga I got everything
Money cash hoes that's my everything
Niggas talking like they heavy slang
We get it straight from the Medellín

[Hook]
