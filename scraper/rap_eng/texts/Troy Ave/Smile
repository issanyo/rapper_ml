[Intro]
Mic check mic check mic check
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, won't you be my neighbor?
Yea you ain't got enough money to be my neighbor

[Chorus]
God is great paper straight (Go ahead and smile)
It don't matter if they hate (Go ahead and smile)
You the one no debate (Go ahead and smile)
Keep it real fuck whoever keep it fake (Go ahead and smile)

[Verse 1]
In the mirror you in love (Go ahead and smile)
This the song you wanna hear in the club (Go ahead and smile)
Everything's on fleek (Go ahead and smile)
Twerking you a little freak (Go ahead and smile)
Doing good by yourself (Go ahead and smile)
On your grind trying to get the good wealth (Go ahead and smile)
You do that shit everyday (Go ahead and smile)
Dodging everything that they put in your way (Go ahead and smile)
You 'boutta graduate college (Go ahead and smile)
Your pussy got low mileage (Go ahead and smile)
And if it don't it none of our business (Go ahead and smile)
Keep it fresher than a stylist (Go ahead and smile)
Dripping wet, feel like water (Go ahead and smile)
Iced out dripping dripping frozen water(Go ahead and smile)
And you bought it on your own (Go ahead and smile)
So when I call you niggas blowing up your phone (Go ahead and smile)

[Chorus]
God is great paper straight (Go ahead and smile)
It don't matter if they hate (Go ahead and smile)
You that nigga no debate (Go ahead and smile)
Keep it real fuck whoever keep it fake (Go ahead and smile)

You alive and you well (Go ahead and smile)
You ain't dead or in jail (Go ahead and smile)
They hope and pray that you will fail (Go ahead and smile)
But you have bread for you lawyer and your bail (Go ahead and smile)
Your work is fire see the texture (Go ahead and smile)
Your cook is coming back extra (Go ahead and smile)
Your putting bricks in the compressor (Go ahead and smile)
You done sold every bird in ya dresser (Go ahead and smile)
You a good jester
Now you in the game (Go ahead and smile)
You see that I couldn't do the same (Go ahead and smile)
And spreading lies on your name (Go ahead and smile)
But all I do is give you fame (Go ahead and smile)
Getting money you don't care (Go ahead and smile)
And getting mad thinking damn it ain't fair (Go ahead and smile)
Man look at your garage (Go ahead and smile)
You own it all while them niggas renting cars  (Go ahead and smile)
Your ankle bracelet coming off (Go ahead and smile)
The ops going down the up north (Go ahead and smile)
Going places living good (Go ahead and smile)
You ain't trapped in the mother fucking hood (Go ahead and smile)
Man I don't front I'm really proud of ya (Go ahead and smile)
