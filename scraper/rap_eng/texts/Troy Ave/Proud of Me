One mo (whoo)
Talk that talk nigga

[Hook]
Figured you'd be proud of me
Man I came from the mud and they label me a thug, and I'm still winnin' (figured you'd be proud me)
Ain't nobody wanna help, so I did it by myself, you could do the same (figured you be proud of me)
Everytime you see me ballin' know I represent us all that's a fact though (figured you be proud of me)

[Verse 1]
I love the way you sway that shit, when I say that shit, you get crazy when the DJ's play my shit
I'm an independent rapper but I got them hits, until I make it mainstream then I got them bricks
But baby we ain't here to talk about drugs and truncheons
Itchin' from a dealer and a thug
I don't want my fate being decided by no judge and I don't want no fake niggas saying bout how real I was
I ain't here for that at all, I'm only here to ball and provide for my kids, haters I ain't stressin' yall
Cowards tried to kill me with a bullet they didn't know I was blessed
Now I'm rollin' with armed securities and bulletproof vests
For the rest of my life I live in luxury
Gettin' money, praisin' God and staying sucka free
If you feel the same way then you fuck with me
Celebrating all my wins sippin' bubbly

[Hook]
Figured you'd be proud of me
Man I came from the mud and they label me a thug, and I'm still winnin' (figured you'd be proud me)
Ain't nobody wanna' help, so I did it by myself, you could do the same (figured you be proud of me)
Everytime you see me ballin' know I represent us all that's a fact though (figured you be proud of me)

[Verse 2]
Fresh outta jail, from a dorm in a dirty date room
Now there's a pool in my backyard and my game room
They was playin' laughin' at it, dyin' in their own shame
Fake niggas never want a real one in the game
Ain't nobody wanna help so I did it by myself
Ain't contribute but they want me to distribute my wealth
I love sayin' "no," nine windows, eagles wouldn't let you outta my shirt you for sure
The difference is I do it for them, that's why I'm truer than them
They got diamonds but my stones shine bluer than them
I run a business while they run around the hood and chill
Waitin' on another million while they wait to be killed
It's the harsh reality, why you mad at me? I ain't makin' moves, I'm importin' em, candidly, when I made the news and was smitten
They wish me good riddance, made it out, the rebel 9-1-1, he the victim of the media, circumstance and the right decisions
The atheist views went against my religion
I stand for somethin' I don't fall for nothin'
They tried to trick me off the streets, now I'm black stuntin'
Figured you'd be proud

[Hook]
Figured you'd be proud of me
Man I came from the mud and they label me a thug, and I'm still winnin' (figured you'd be proud me)
Ain't nobody wanna' help, so I did it by myself, you could do the same (figured you be proud of me)
Everytime you see me ballin' know I represent us all that's a fact though (figured you be proud of me)
