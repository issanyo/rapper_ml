I'm on a highway doing it my way
How you got it, nigga
Troy Ave in this motherfucker
How you float in this motherfucker
Niggas balling, niggas get to fucking
This little piggy went to the market
That little piggy went to play
This little piggy went to Target
Now'yay
This little piggy went to the market
Y'all little piggies went to play
This little piggy went to Target
Now'yay
I came a long way from the
Breakdown in that crack house
In broad day'out in the burbs
A nigga get killed every day'
I'm New York mellow with
A'I just bought a Benz, either way I flows
Showing my teeth, tell 'em fuck sleep'
This little piggy went to the market
That little piggy went to play
This little piggy went to Target
Now'yay
This little piggy went to the market
Y'all little piggies went to play
This little piggy went to Target
Now'yay
I just opened up my eyes and wrote what I saw
Autobiographical, you know that it's raw
Cook game proper'I'mma be seen by a doctor
Go to DR, light me a cigar
Blowing smoke while I'm getting blown by Anita
Your boy hot and fly like grits on a cheetah
Spotted young player head to toe in Adidas
All day I deal drugs and shit
Kick flows, rip shows, might even club a bit
Sip more, flick'fuck it, the money fit
This little piggy went to the market
That little piggy went to play
This little piggy went to Target
Now'yay
This little piggy went to the market
Y'all little piggies went to play
This little piggy went to Target
Now'yay
This little piggy went to the market
That little piggy went to play
This little piggy went to Target
Now'yay
This little piggy went to the market
Y'all little piggies went to play
This little piggy went to Target
Now'yay
