[Snoop Dogg - talking]
Oh, yabba dabba doo bobble
This is somethin new
Puff, puff, pass and the Bo$$
I mean what do you mean, what do you mean
This is only the beginnin (Doggystyle, Bad Boy)

[Snoop Dogg]
It's a quarter past one, but it feel like two
Ey young Puff, what you want your big homey ta do?
Just say the word and his head spat out all over the curb
It ain't nothin to a playa, it's like rollin some herb
Click, clack on you fags, now I'm back in the burbs
I'm ready to splurge, about to put you niggas in perms
The first and the third, is the day that I usually reserve
To get this money with my niggas that bird the birds
Word to curb, my nigga you can fuck what you heard
You niggas talk shit, pop that bitch, now swerve (take that)
Yeah, I'm a Dogg Pound gangsta for life
I'm twice as night, yep and I dump on sight
Get through with ya'll as I catch my flight
I got a show I gotta do out in Miami tonight
With some Colombian friends of mine
Maybe we'll spend some time
Choppin up some million dollar shit up outta crime a mine

[Snoop Dogg - Hook] - 2X
And you don't quit
Ride to the rhythm of some gangsta shit
And you don't stop
(*two gun shots*) Pop Pop nigga what? nigga huh?

[Loon]
Uh, yeah, Loon
Niggas act like niggas ain't clap at nigga before
Like Loon never punch nigga in the jaw
Nigga quick to pop shit, never been in a war
Nigga get on my hot chick, start bendin the law
He the same chump nigga, used to send to the store
Ran off with twenty dollars, now don't send him no more
He them grimey ass niggas with the scent of a whore
Tryin a scheme on a nigga, that's clean
Think I'm gonna scream, but a...
Loon on some green nigga Infrared beam, malign nigga, spleen know what I mean
It's not a thing now (that's right)
Do what I say, leave you by the lake, put two in your face (uh huh)
With shit I couldn't do around Mase
You better check my forte, Loon got all yay
On Broadway they givin nigga royal all day
I ran through the game like Christian Fauria
How can the chicks ignore me, when the chicks adore me

[P. Diddy]
Come on now

[Hook]

[P. Diddy - talking behind Hook]
That's right
C'mon, yeah
Let's ride

[Snoop Dogg]
Shoot 'em up bang bang, yeah it's a cold thang
Diddy want Doggy to get in my baby body man
Get 'im got 'im man, tryin a feel up his body man
With a lot of thangs (fuck the nigga ohhh, *gun shots*)
A matter fact he gettin potty trained
Livin with his momma man
Stressed and pain, no gain
No fame, for a nigga like the D-O
Put a couple holes in your loud mouth zero

If you step to us, you'll get fucked up quick
We keep a Tek with us, that we bustin bitch
Niggas be talkin shit, but they be walkin quick
(P Diddy: This Doggystyle, Bad Boy bitch)

When I pull out my nine and pop two times
When you see my clique in this bitch we kickin it
Dogg's be rippin this
Slip a clip in it, flip the script and then
I'm the rap nigga bangin that (CRIP)

[Hook] - 6X - w/ ad libs

[Snoop Dogg - talking behind Hook - w/ variations]
Ride, ride ya'll
Ride, ride ya'll
Bad Boy II
(Fuck the world)

Ride on a nigga, like bang on a nigga - repeated until end

[Female voice - harmonizes with Hook and by herself, until the end]

[P. Diddy - talking] - w/ variations
Nigga what? Nigga huh? - repeated
Doggystyle, Bad Boy
It's just the beginning motherfuckers
Yeah, been doin this shit for decades ..

[Snoop Dogg - talking]
Bang, bang
Ya don't quit
Ya don't stop
Pop, pop nigga

Shot 'em down, leave 'em on the ground for my homies
Nigga be actin like hoes
(*two gun shots*)
