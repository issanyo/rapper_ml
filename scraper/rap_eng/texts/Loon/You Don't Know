[Intro - Loon - talking]
Yeah, see a lotta finger pointin goin on
A lot of judgment bein passed
Niggas don't even know what their fuckin talkin 'bout
I go by the name of Loon
And I represent this Bad Boy shit
'Til the motherfuckin casket drop
Damn right, uh, aiyyo, aiyyo

[Verse 1]
Niggas don't know me, it's time that I give you the first taste
In case niggas suffer the worst case
Harlem my birthplace, I used to run with niggas that hurt Mase
I started "Harlem World" in the first place
Niggas was thirsty, jumped out the window
Indoed the fuck up, it cost they friends yo
Cause that's how friends go
But niggas tryna get they ends yo
Forget about the nigga that lent yo
Ask for dollar, now you wanna holla cause your ends low
But look at how far your friends go
Killer is doin it, nigga Loon drop bitches is losin it
Keep the tool cocked, niggas is usin it
Only if it's a must, nigga front, put they dick in the dust
That's what you get, fuck with niggas like us
Loon that nigga that bust, even though you think that nigga just lust
These chicks, after I hit, I put the bitch on the bus

[Chorus]
(Oh you don't know who the fuck I be?)
Oh it's the L, double O, N, representin the NYC
(Any nigga disrespect my G's)
Son a nigga get jacked, nigga get crapped, even dumped in the sea
(Oh you don't know what the fuck I know?)
When it come to the dough, nigga I'ma pro, when I step to them hoes
(Oh you don't know what the fuck I do?)
To a nigga like you thinkin your crew gon' do somethin to Loon

[Verse 2]
I'm glad Puff let me get to my gat
Cause now I'm 'bout to give 'em my pack
Get in the 'Lac, sit in the back
Ride around with my shit in my lap
The first nigga react, the first nigga act, nigga get clapped
I don't get down with you niggas like that
So all that yikkety-yak, a nigga front, gun clickety clack
Make it hard for you niggas that rap
Cause when you gotta pick up the slack
Pick up a pack or pick up a plaque
You ain't think my flow could pick up like that
The way I stick to a track, the impeller gettin hit with a bat
One swing'll bring your shit to your lap
And make you shit in your slacks
Your body shape forever zip and your trapped
Let me tell you about the difference in rap
And the difference is street, niggas that creep
Bust your shit with the heat
If I find out a nigga soft and he sweet
I'm knockin 'em off their feet
Snatchin his bitch and ridin off with his Jeep

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Uh, yeah, aiyyo you frontin like you seen stacks
Deep down, you's a clown and you don't need to feed back
Hey yo, y'all niggas need to ease back
Now how you come with your guns and your ones, and your sons like you squeeze gats
Niggas don't believe that, and them bitches don't believe that
That's why you ride with your seat back
Niggas don't like you, they probably put a bullet right through
Ya motherfuckin chest with they rifle, niggas livin trifle
And last year 'round this time, we did it to a nigga just like you
Lean like the Eiffel, scream on you like your wife do
Gleam on you like the ice do, I might seem like a nice dude
Even though niggas know, got a nigga eighteen that'll knife you
Split nigga ass crack, picture we waitin on ass cap
When you could get it like the last cat, rat a tat tat

[Chorus] - 2X
