Ay yo, man
Now-a-days, man, life is so short, man
This life the way we living
Lot of us don't even know why
But I know one thing, man
One thing even an idiot can comprehend
You're only guaranteed two things, man
Life, and Death
All the in-betweens, man
Is up to you, you got free will, you know?
But forever know
Live or Die
