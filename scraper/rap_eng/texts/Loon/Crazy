Boy, I know you're a bit unsure
So I wanna let you know that you got me
Baby I'm all yours
Gotta have you around
I don't wanna do without you here
If you still don't get the picture

Heart is racing when you look at me

[Loon]
I'm young Marcus
Aka Harlem Knights
Good morning, ma
Heard you had a long flight
You look so good and pretty as the sunshine
Girl, you're a gold mine
Wifey and the whole nine

You captivated my whole mind first time I met you
And Lord knows I ain't got time to sweat you
But you look crazy in that new Mercedes

And baby, I can't act like shit don't phase me
'Cause I try to fight it
Try to conceal and hide it
No matter what girl I can't deny it

I'm just a fool for your love
I'm cool out the clubs
I just wanna move smooth like I'm cruising on dubs
(Say what)

I'm a grown man, ma
I choose who I love
Choose who I hug
Choose who I usually rub
For other chicks I don't usually budge
If you wanna know the reason why I choose you
Because you got me crazy

I'm crazy about you (crazy)
And I, I gotta have you
'Cause I like the way you making me feel
(Boy, I like the way)
Boy for real
La la la la la la

I'm crazy about you
(Make me feel)
And I, I gotta have you
(Gotta have you)
'Cause I like the way you making me feel
Boy for real

(Break it down
Come on)

La la la la la la
I'm crazy about you
(I'm crazy about you, baby)
And I, I gotta have you
'Cause I like the way you making me feel
(You make me feel so good)
Boy for real

La la la la la la
I'm crazy about you
(Dream)
And I, I gotta (2003) have you
'Cause I like the way you making me feel
Boy for real
(Bad boy, baby)

I'm crazy about you
And I, I gotta have you
'Cause I like the way you making me feel
Boy for real

I'm crazy about you
And I, I gotta have you
'Cause I like the way you making me feel
Boy for real

Yeah, I like this one
