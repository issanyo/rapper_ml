[Intro - Loon - talking]
Uh, check it out, yeah
Let me tell you a little story
A little couple street tales, ya know
On the shit I be seein
Cause yo I'm from Harlem and everyday I see shit yo
This, check it, uh

[Verse 1 - Loon]
Now here's a story about a young kid, had everything in life
Never had to ask for nothin more than twice
His pops was gettin it, moms was a lawyer
And his ball game almost got him draft to the Hoyas
He fell in love with this chick named Latoya
But little did he know, Latoya was a ho
Lotta shit about Latoya he don't know
She fucked with some nigga named Bo, who sold blow
But the day he found out, turned the town out
Ran up on Bo and his ass got pound out
But yo when he came through, he seen the devil in disguise
It was Bo with the devil in his eyes
Mack 11 on his side, him and seven other guys
And every last one of these niggas ready to ride
Beside the fact, that this cat in the mix
His jaw all broke up but that could be fixed
Drawers all soaked up, cause that nigga pissed
Full force, cocked back the rap nigga shit
Now perhaps nigga flipped or perhaps nigga cried
But deep down this nigga didn't really wanna die

[Chorus - Female voice]
Niggas get a little bit of loot, then think they fly
Then they wanna claim they thugs, but they really don't wanna die

Niggas get a little bit of loot, and then think they fly
Then they wanna claim they thugs, but they really don't wanna die

[Verse 2 - Loon]
Uh, yeah, uh
Now here's a story about another nigga by the name of Jermaine
This nigga pushin thirty and still in the game
He won't change, all he do is sniff cocaine
Recruit niggas outta school and poison they brain
I'm sayin any nigga fuckin with Jermaine
This nigga have you hustle in the rain, or bust a nigga brain
This duke was a menace in fact
But these Dominican cats could finish him black
Cause he didn't finish them packs, didn't finish that weight
The kid he had picture, caught ten in the face
Him and his ace, walk around with Mack 10 in they waist
But pop never been a disgrace
Word to mother, he got contract killers, combat niggas
They kill if a whole fifth of Coniac liquor
Skipped town thinkin they wouldn't harm that nigga
Found out they know where your mom's at nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Loon]
The last story Samantha, type of chick that you pamper
Got a lotta junk in her Pamper
Pops was a Panther, her mom's some happy camper
That thought the whole world of Samantha
Moved to Atlanta, at the age of 18
Got a couple girls and they formed the A-team
Some play things, specialize in blazin
Her and her girlfriend Mayling from Beijing
They was bugged, harrassin the scrubs
Everybody knew about Samantha and clubs
Gullible, get Samantha some drugs
And you could take her home, get Samantha some love
Back shots, yo Samantha don't budge
Probably all the niggas that Samantha done fucked
Lotta kids, she done twist lotta ways
'Til she found out she HIV positive

[Chorus] - 2X
