I know it's not too ghetto
I know it's not too ghetto
I said I know it's not too ghetto

You better check yourself, respect yourself
You better go for self because I flow for self
You gets no love from me

[Verse 1]
I'll tell you why there's no love
Simply you're not cool enough
For what we had between us
Don't you know you lost my trust

People ask me where you've been
And I tell them we're just friends
'Cause it's so obvious that it's never gonna work for us
Oh no, no

[Chorus]
Play with my emotions, you gets no devotion
And you gets no love, gets no love
You can't get no love from me
You can't even be my friend
And you gets no love again
Whatever you do it will come back to you
You gets no love from me

[Verse 2]
Tell you why we can't hook up
(You gets no love)
'Cause I had about enough
(You gets no love)
Hearing all the lies you tell
(You gets no love...
Boy, I though I knew you well
...from me)

People think that you're my man (my man)
They don't even understand
(They don't even understand because)
Just because I let you get some
That don't make you the one
We ain't even in love
You know that you play

[Chorus] (P. Diddy)
Play with my emotions, you gets no devotion
You gets no love, gets no love
You can't get no love from me
You can't even be my friend (yeah)
And you gets no love again (come on)
Said you gets no love, gets no love
(Ayo, Faith, let me talk to 'em one time, check this out)
You gets no love from me

[P. Diddy]
Yo, how the situation get so raw
To the point we don't kiss no more
Things I miss, you don't miss no more
That night I met you on the disco floor
Every night since missed you more
Making hits on tour
Now when I knock, you don't answer the door
The phone ring, you don't answer no more
'Cause you ain't tryna chance it no more
Got to find me a new diva
Something pretty for P. Diddy and his two-seater

[Loon]
Now you could never have a piece of my love
So when you see me don't reach for no hug
And don't speak in the club
Don't tell me how you deeply in love
Other day you tried to greet me with thugs
That wanted to heat me with slugs
See the message on my beeper was bugged
Try to chill, lay deep in the cut
But you keeping it up
Even my girl think of beating you up
The way you keeping in touch
She don't know if niggas cheating or what

[Bridge]
Boy, we had a cool relationship
But you couldn't handle it

Play with my emotions, you gets no devotion
Whatever you do it will come back to you
You can't even be my friend
And you gets no love again
Said you gets no love, gets no love, gets no love from me

Play with my emotions, you gets no devotions
Whatever you do it will come back to you
You can't even be my friend
And you gets no love again
You gets no love from me
