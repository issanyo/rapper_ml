[Intro: P. Diddy]
Yeah, is that bounce right here
Time to move on, time to be strong
Don't stop now, straight to the top now
Someone who truly understands
How to treat a man
This is what I need

[Verse 1: P Diddy]
Girl you made me believe again
If you happy then be with him, go 'head mommy breathe again
Go 'head mommy breathe again, don't stop now straight to the top now
Go 'head mommy make it hot now
I need me a love that's 'gon make my heart stop now
And what I need is simple, five foot five with dimples
Potential wife credentials
Know about the life I'm into, life I've been through
And how I had a trifilin mental
So ride with me, G Force fly with me
Times get hard cry with me, die with me
White beach sands lye with me
My advice is forget the limelight
Let's make love, while we listen to Frank White
So tight, now I understand life

[Hook:  Ginuwine , Mario Winans & (P Diddy)]
What I need
(Yeah take that)
Is a pretty woman next to me
A pretty woman yeah baby
To share the dreams that I Believe
(Dream with me, believe in me)
Maybe we could start a family
Start a family baby
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need

[Verse 2: Loon & (P Diddy)]
Listen to me now what should I say now? Come on ma
Been a whole day now I wanna lay 'round
And sip coladas, dipped in Prada
I'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars
We out in Vegas Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass
'Bout the size of a campaign ad
You don't know how you look to me
But if love was a crime you be a crook to me
Cause mommy I've done been around the world
Seened alot of places
Been around your girl believe I read faces
I can tell she don't want me prevail
But I, learn my lesson watchin Sean stressin'
So why listen to her and start guessin?
Mommy you ain't ready to ride then start dressin
I need a girl 2 receive my mom's blessin
Confession, my love no contestin
I need affection
(Yes I need affection, let's go Mario!)

[Bridge: Mario Winans]
Girl what the hell is on your mind?
I could be dumb but I'm not blind
There's something leaking in your mind
Don't look to good for you and me, always getting weak
That ain't what I need, baby!!!


[Hook: Mario Winans]
What I need baby
Is a pretty woman next to me
A pretty woman yeah baby
To share the dreams that I Believe
I need a girl in my life
Maybe we could start a family
Start a family baby
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
How to treat a man
This is what I need

[Verse 3: P Diddy]
Ay yo, the sun don't shine forever
But as long as were here then we might as well shine together
Nevermind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that'll last forever
So let's stop the pain, stop the rain
Put stress to rest girl, stop the games
Name the spot, mommy I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the Range
Ma I got some thangs, knowned to put rocks in rings
Pushing hundred foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever been to Saint Tropez
Or seen a brotha play a Mandolay?
Girl I wanna just look in your eyes and watch the sun rise
No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin, you I believe in
Love you till the day I stop breathing
I love you girl

[Outro:  Ginuwine and Mario Winans]
This is what I need
Is a pretty woman next to me
A pretty woman next to me
To share the dreams that I believe
When I wake up in the morning
Maybe we could start a family
I wanna see your pretty face
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
Oh yeah oh yeah
This is what I need
Is a pretty woman next to me
To share the dreams that I believe
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need baby
Is a pretty woman next to me
Standing next to me
To share the dreams that I Believe
When I wake up in the morning
Maybe we could start a family
I wanna see your pretty face baby
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
Oh yeah oh yeah
This is what I need
Is a pretty woman next to me
