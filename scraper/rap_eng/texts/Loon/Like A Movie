[Intro - Loon] (Claudette Ortiz)
(Ha) uh, yeah (*harmonizing*)
Check it out
I'm with my man A-Con (c'mon)
And I go by the name of Loon (yeah)
And this a Bad Boy exclusive (uh huh)
Nah I mean? (c'mon, c'mon)
Young Marcus (ha)
Uh, young, pretty and heartless

[Verse 1 - Loon]
Yo, I tried to be a gentlemen
Even respect the girls who had many men
I had a girl that lived in the tenement, straight seduced me
Pretty face, I kept shorty laced in Gucci
She made niggas wait like groupies
Even made 'em lace her hooptie
And still ain't hit it
Spend their money and all, still ain't get it
Buyin bitches his order, still she ain't with it
So, don't be mad, when she callin me dad (don't be mad, callin me dad)
Rollin around in the Jag with the 30-day tag (what?)
Some shit you paid for, worked and slaved for
Ever since you met the trick I made more (yeah)
Cheddar then ever before
You 'bout to walk down the aisle and I met her on tour
I ain't never had a thousand dollar sweater before
'Til your stupid ass went and got in the bed with the whore
You pulled a no, nigga

[Chorus - Claudette Ortiz] - w/ ad libs
No way you can't use me
I'm smoother than that
You wanna live like me
You will never see that
Live my life like a movie
How will you top that
No way you can't use me
I'm smoother than that

[Verse 2 - Loon]
Uh, yo it's funny how ya money pile
All of a sudden surrounded by these funny style
Chicks gettin money now, bitch had a hundred thou
Thought she said somethin slick
I couldn't wait to get in bed with that bitch (oh yeah)
I took her clothes off politely
In case she chose not to like me
That's when I ate the hole while I wifey
Bitch start to like me (nah, nah, nah ...)
Then I flipped her like a savage
A nigga tried to rip her body cabbage
But she gettin a lotta cabbage
And nigga I gotta have it
I swear tryna hit shit like a rabbit
Now shorty think she established, she givin me karats
Buyin me cars that superstars be havin
Clingin a nigga like a magnet
Becoming a addict, actin like she ain't never had dick (what?)
Melodramatic, always some static, man this bitch is erratic
Man I ain't think about that car you could have it (nooo!)

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - Loon]
Now I was pushin in tan land, it was me, my man Stan
This chick Jo Anne from San Fran, met her on Pan Am
Told me her man, some tycoon
Is pickin up 1.5 at high noon (high noon)
So why Loon had to make moves like typhoon (typhoon)
Pull a couple of strings bada boom, bada bing (bada bing)
It's on now, I got my niggas and we ready to roll
I got my niggas and we ready for war
Whatever it be, 1.5 nigga cheddar for free
Now how this bitch gon' get the cheddar for me
I'm ready to see, cause when this shit is all set and it's done
I'm the type to get the bread and just run
Her man was soft, I think it's better to run
Then to hit him in the head with the gun
I'ma veteran son, I ain't type to squeeze beretta for fun
I'm not dumb, I do it better than them, c'mon

[Chorus] - 2X - w/ ad libs until the end
