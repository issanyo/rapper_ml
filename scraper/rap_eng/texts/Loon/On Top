[Verse 1: Loon]
Yo, I’m a gangsta, outlaw, indoor, outdoor
Nigga tell me right, Loon going southpaw
This is Bad Boy, we don’t give a fuck about y’all
Step in the room, see the bitch come up out y’all
I fuck with niggas, but it’s something about y’all
Acting like Loon can’t do shit without y’all
I call my menses in Benzes to out y’all
See how it feel when your friends be without y’all
I been doing it; coke, I been moving it
Before you niggas thought of the block, I been through with it
Keep confusing this music shit, die for some foolishness
Frontin’ like you hard when you’s a bitch
You hit the block, probably lose your whip
Niggas snatch your watch and the rocks out your crucifix
Watch how we do this shit, Bad Boy 2K’n it
So playboy, what type of pimpin’ is you playing with?

[Chorus: Marsha]
See, they Bad Boy money can’t done
You’re too slow, can’t keep up, na betta run
You try to stop it but we’ve gone too far
You try to stop it but we’re just too large
See, they Bad Boy money can’t done
You’re too slow, can’t keep up, na betta run
You try to stop it but we’ve gone too far
You try to stop it but we’re just too large

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
Let’s get, one thing clear
Still the same cat who put the ‘Flava in Ya Ear’
Still the same cat who let B.I.G. rock with Total
Most wanted, successful rap mogul
Still got niggas whylin’ out on the floor
Still got the sky blue drop-top Azure
Still at eat at Justin’s and Sean John velour
Still humble, and still want more
Still hate war, still want peace
And I still can’t stand to see Blacks beefin’
Y’all still sleepin’ and we still eatin’
Still bring the heat, whylin’ out on the weekend
Still happenin’, Black, and don’t need a reason
Still platinum, back in London and Sweden
Still pack the Garden like Adam did Eve’n
And still got rhymes to leave your girlfriend freakin’
Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha-ha

[Chorus: Marsha]
See, they Bad Boy money can’t done
You’re too slow, can’t keep up, na betta run
You try to stop it but we’ve gone too far
You try to stop it but we’re just too large
See, they Bad Boy money can’t done
You’re too slow, can’t keep up, na betta run
You try to stop it but we’ve gone too far
You try to stop it but we’re just too large

[Verse 3]
[Loon]
Ayo, besides all the money and riches, videos and pictures
Slip and these silly hoes’ll getcha
But not me, I’m too cocky
I love when the women scream “Hey, papi”
I love when a chick leave my crib knock-kneed
And I love when a player hater try to knock me
Or cock block me, but you can’t stop me
You cuff ‘em all you want, but you can’t top me

[Puff Daddy]
I’m just a B-A-D, B-O-Y
Son, we multiply—nigga, we don’t die
Niggas frontin’ like we ain’t fly
But nigga can’t name nothin’ that we ain’t buy
Or we ain’t try, or we ain’t drive
The judge said “Not guilty” and he ain’t lie
Niggas need a hit, it’s to me they cry
So why front like nigga P.D. ain’t live
Come on, man

[Chorus: Marsha]
See, they Bad Boy money can’t done
You’re too slow, can’t keep up, na betta run
You try to stop it but we’ve gone too far
You try to stop it but we’re just too large
See, they Bad Boy money can’t done
You’re too slow, can’t keep up, na betta run
You try to stop it but we’ve gone too far
You try to stop it but we’re just too large

See, they Bad Boy money can’t done
You’re too slow, can’t keep up, na betta run
You try to stop it but we’ve gone too far
You try to stop it but we’re just too large
See, they Bad Boy money can’t done
You’re too slow, can’t keep up, na betta run
You try to stop it but we’ve gone too far
You try to stop it but we’re just too large

[Outro: Marsha]
You got some niggas, real thingers
Real money makers, no fake—Bad Boy’s on top
And they won’t stop, no
You got some niggas, real thingers
Real money makers, no fake—Bad Boy’s on top
And they won’t stop, no
