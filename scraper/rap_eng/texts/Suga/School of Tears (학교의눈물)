Victim-wrong
Perpetrator-wrong
Bystander-maybe
Bystander-maybe

[Verse 1: RM, Jin]
"Nice kid complex"-that was my illness
(But I was still nice to everyone)
That was my excuse
Behind my back they were talking shit
In front of me they were acting nice
I pretended not to notice, school was a battleground
Perhaps this was my own battle in the ring called classroom
Someone would've brushed it off as something you shouldn't care about
Oh I don't care, but that's something only adults can do easily
Not perpetrators
Not victims
This is a place where we've turned into bystanders!
Even if you point your finger at me and call me coward
I'm fine with it, but how would you define it?
You know I can't lend you a hand
If I did that I'll end up the same as you
Don't be blinded by justice, the hero is dead
This is a reality, the only way to survive, there are no options

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
This is the ring called classroom
This is a stadium without any referee, only an audience
You know there will never be victor everyone will lose
This is the ring called classroom
This is a stadium without any referee, only an audience
You know there will never be victor everyone will lose

This is the ring called classroom
This is a stadium without any referee, only an audience
You know there will never be victor everyone will lose
This is the ring called classroom
This is a stadium without any referee, only an audience
You know there will never be victor everyone will lose

[Chorus: Jin, Rap Monster]
School-wrong, Society-wrong
Parents-wrong, Teachers-wrong

SUGA

[Verse 2: Suga]
The basis of a school violence
A vicious that can never end
There's no exit in this crowded ring called a classroom
That's right, in the end
School is like another mini society
A jungle made carelessly by adults
They made the weaklings weak, they made the strong powerful
Of course since they were strong
They made the weak suffer
A society
Built on the teachings that friends are only to pretend
The morals of adults made us step on the weaks to rise the top
Corporal punishment has been banned
In a moment of force
"I didn't know because I was out of it" became an excuse
That's right, this society is filled with bystanders
That are no different from perpetrators
The students trapped inside clasrooms
Known as themselves are also victims

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
This is the ring called classroom
This is a stadium without any referee, only an audience
You know there will never be victor everyone will lose
This is the ring called classroom
This is a stadium without any referee, only an audience
You know there will never be victor everyone will lose

This is the ring called classroom
This is a stadium without any referee, only an audience
You know there will never be victor everyone will lose
This is the ring called classroom
This is a stadium without any referee, only an audience
You know there will never be victor everyone will lose

학교 wrong, 사회 wrong
부모 wrong, 선생 wrong
피해자 wrong, 가해자 wrong
방관자 maybe, 방관자 maybe

[Verse 1: RM, Jin]
‘착한아이 콤플렉스’
그게 내 병명이었지
(그래도 모두한테 잘해줬어..)
그게 내 변명이었지
뒤에선 나쁘다며 씹고
앞에선 착한 척했어
봐도 못 본 척했어
학교는 전쟁터
어쩌면 이건 학교란 사각의
링 위에서의 나만의 싸움
누군가는 그저 방관에
대한 정당화일뿐이라 하겠지만

Oh I don’t care
그건 어른들이니까 쉽게
할 수 있는 얘기
가해자 아님 피해자 아님
다 방관자가 되는 여기
날 비겁하다 손가락질해도 좋아
근데 넌 얼마나 정의로웠었냐
손 내밀 수 없는 걸 알잖아
그랬다간 나도 똑같이 되잖아
어설픈 정의감에 사로잡히지마
영웅은 죽었어
이건 현실이야, 살아야 할 뿐
반전은 없어

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
여긴 교실이라는 사각의 링과
심판 없는 관객뿐인 경기장
You know 영원히
승자는 없어 모두 다 지지
승자는 없어 모두 다 지지

여긴 교실이라는 사각의 링과
심판 없는 관객뿐인 경기장
You know 영원히
승자는 없어 모두 다 지지
승자는 없어 모두 다 지지

[Chorus: Jin, Rap Monster]
학교 wrong, 사회 wrong
부모 wrong, 선생 wrong
피해자 wrong, 가해자 wrong
방관자 maybe, 방관자 maybe

[Verse 2: Suga]
(SUGA) 학교폭력의 근간
끊지 못한 악순환
교실이란 좁은 사각의
링에는 없어 출구가
그래 결국 학교란
이 사회의 축소판
어른들이 멋대로 만든
약육강식의 풍토가
약자를 약하게 만들고
강자를 강하게 만들었지
강자니까 약한자는 당연히
그렇게 당하게 만들었지
친구는 적이란 가르침
덕에 만들어진 힘의 서열사회
힘이 없는 자를 밟고 올라서게
만든 어른들의 상식 선에서
체벌은 금지됐어, 폭력의 순간
‘미처 알지 못했다’란 말은
그저 변명이 됐어
그래 이 사회가 방관자이자
다른 가해자
학생들은 교실이란
우리 안에 갇힌 피해자

[Chorus: Jin, Rap Monster]
학교 wrong, 사회 wrong
부모 wrong, 선생 wrong
피해자 wrong, 가해자 wrong
방관자 wrong, 방관자 wrong
