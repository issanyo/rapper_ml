It was a good start
In itself
Before I knew it, we were tired of each other
In all of these meaningless emotions

Repeated seesaw game
I'm tired of this
Repeated seesaw game
We're getting tired of each other

Were the petty arguments the start?
The moment I became heavier than you
Because there's never been parallels in the first place
Maybe I became more greedy and tried to fit in with you
Is there really a need to keep repeating ourselves
Saying this was love and this is love?
They're tired of each other, they seem to hold the same hand
Well, then

Alright, a repeating seesaw game
It's about time we put an end to it
All right, this boring seesaw game
Somebody has to get out of here
Though neither of us can

Don't let anyone know who'll get off first
Let’s not drag things out, however our hearts lead us
Are we getting out of here or not
This repeated seesaw game
We have to stop it now

People can be so crafty
They know they’ll get hurt if one person is missing
Because we don't want to be the villains
In the midst of a series of vague responsibilities
And we get so tired or if that we finally became parallel
But we didn’t want this kind of parallel

At first, we showed off who was heavier
We'd brag and smile
Now we're trying to beat each other
We're in a competition
The fire of a quarrel
It’ll only end if someone gets off right here
We’re acting like we’re comforting each other
But it’s mixed with thorns
Can’t keep doing this, we need to make a decision

If we didn’t have feelings for each other
If we didn’t think of each other
Would we have dragged it out like this?
Now if you don’t have any more feelings
This seesaw is dangerous
Stop thinking about me

Alright, a repeating seesaw game
It's about time we put an end to it
All right, this boring seesaw game
Somebody has to get out of here
Though neither of us can

(Hol' up Hol' up) I walk on this seesaw without you
(Hol' up Hol' up) Just like the beginning when you weren't here
(Hol' up Hol' up) I walk on this seesaw without you
(Hol' up Hol' up) I'm getting off this seesaw without you

Alright, a repeating seesaw seesaw game
