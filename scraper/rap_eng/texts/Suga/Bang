[Chorus : Kamp]

If i take one step all you hear is bang
'take two steps you gon' hear bang bang
If i take three steps it be bangdadadang
If i take four steps it be "yeiyeiyeeee"

[Verse 1 : Kamp & Suga]

If i take five its a wrap
If i take six i'd be up in the bank
If i take seven it be me and the gang
If we down to the last then we stick to the plan tellem'
Mic in the hand till it hits the fan
J in the other hand rolling up again
We don't see the other man keep it in the fam
90s be the gang and the king is Kamp

Kamp i don tire for their matter
Get one girl wey dey burst my dada
Say she no go follow me cuz' i no get raba
Cuz' i no get five gold rings like don dada
Na kuli kuli we dey take drink garri
But we still get plan say we go buy ferrari
Dem dey try hold rebel down but mo yari
Cuz' i know the kind blessing i dey carry

[Chorus : Kamp & Suga]

[Verse two : Suga & Kamp]

Rebel and 90s
I know say the girl them go like this
I know say some boys go wan fight this
But i just dey laugh when boys acting childish
Down to my lungu
Nobody they there nobody do good
Everybody just want to jumbu
Everybody just want to jumbu you

Make way it be me through the backdoor
'Bout to cut green like a tractor
Pull up holy ghost like a pastor
Number one spot is the only the i planned for
Kamp and Suga be some outlaws
We in the building i see you outdoors
Holding down my ship like an anchor
Once your an ex you can never be a factor
Mic in the hand till it hits the fan
J in the other hand rolling up again
We don't see the other man keep it in the fam
90s be the gang and the king is Kamp
Mic in the hand till it hits the fan
J in the other hand rolling up again
We don't see the other man keep it in the fam
90s be the gang and the king is Kamp

[Chorus]

[Verse Three : Kamp]

Oya hollup'
You know when we come its hookup
Lookin' for them boys tell the mandem to lookup
All they studio lowkey we they cook up
Tryna have patience we already had Goodluck
I remember when they used to form not knowing
Overpaid our dues now you the ones owing
I'm still flowing
Still good and i'm still growing
Rip up the beat i'm the one that'd be still sewing
Burst brain
We off the track like a lost train
It's the Kamp y'all
Shoutout Suga y'all
