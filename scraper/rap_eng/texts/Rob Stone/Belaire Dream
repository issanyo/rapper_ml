[Chorus]
I can't stop, won't pump my brakes
I push my people to the top and we can't go another way
I'm deep inside my mind, I brainstorm all day
About the pieces to the pie I need on my plate
I can't lie things are going my way
All these snakes in the game can't even look me in the face
Who'd knew I'd be famous, I knew I'd be straight
And yeah I know I'll be the greatest if I just stay patient

[Verse]
It's hard to stay patient I want the profit
Don't need no bottles poppin' long as money in my pocket
I used to plot this, I made a wish [?]
My momma said "you got this", got all my shit and got lit
I thought I lost it, but I ain't lost shit
Just lost some people who ain't wanna see a nigga boss up
I ran my cards up, now I don't talk much
Just leave 'em starstruck, I'm gettin' Starbucks
I go full throttle, drink my [?] right out the bottle
I've been sleepin' with a model, she ain't hit me with a follow
I give my heart up, sold my soul until my body rot
I'm grindin' for my spot, I told my shorty I'm just after guap

[Chorus]
I can't stop, won't pump my brakes
I push my people to the top and we can't go another way
I'm deep inside my mind, I brainstorm all day
About the pieces to the pie I need on my plate
I can't lie things are going my way
All these snakes in the game can't even look me in the face
Who'd knew I'd be famous, I knew I'd be straight
And yeah I know I'll be the greatest if I just stay patient
