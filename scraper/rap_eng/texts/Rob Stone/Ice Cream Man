[Verse 1]
Rob getting leverage
I might roll up in a second
I been riding around the town
Smoking dope and knockin bitches
Swear to god my life so hectic
I been stressin need my medicine
Gotta hit a jig and catch the plug for my necessities

[Chorus]
Hey ice cream man, hey ice cream man
Can I see you for a second?
I been going hard and need some smoke to keep me level
Ice cream man, hey ice cream man
My nigga do you got my medicine
I need some fire, wax, and bro please don’t forget my edibles

[Verse 2]
Ten-dollar special
I got grams on a pedestal
Smoke those bitches down
Cause I live once and don’t regret it
Downtown baby, I let half go for eighty
I can flip a pound and double up cuz bitch I got it

[Chorus]
Hey ice cream man, hey ice cream man
Can I see you for a second?
I been going hard and need some smoke to keep me level
Ice cream man, hey ice cream man
My nigga do you got my medicine
I need some fire, wax, and bro please don’t forget my edibles
