[Verse]
Watch me walk up in the spot and pull my cash out
And if you see me with a bitch just know she bad now
Now man my bitches often bad, they extra bad now
I count my money every time I think I spazzed out
Watch me walk up in the spot and get harassed now
I know you seen me from a distance, always stand out
My fuckin' smile could make a bitch wanna leave her man now
Your bitch behind me askin' me to take her pants down
What it do? Lil nigga this the truth that I'm givin'
Better get it nigga listen get your pad out
Hot pursuit for the digits in the coupe with two bitches
She a whoop, she ain't worried bout her man now

[Hook]
Watch me walk up in the spot and pull my (just watch me)
Watch me walk up in the spot and pull my (just watch me)
Watch me walk up in the spot and pull my cash out
Watch me walk up in the spot and pull my cash out
Watch me walk up in the spot and pull my cash out
Watch me walk up in the spot and pull my cash out
Watch me walk up in the spot and pull my cash out

[Bridge]
I hit the border for some fuckin' new pants now
My niggas on the stage and you still in the damn crowd
Oh that's wicked, wicked, wicked, bitches prance now
I swear I saw some of 'em keepin' bands now

[Hook]
Walk up in the spot and pull my cash out
Watch me walk up in the spot and pull my cash out
Watch me walk up in the spot and pull my cash out
Watch me walk up in the spot and pull my cash out
Watch me walk up in the spot and pull my cash out
Watch me walk up in the spot and pull my cash out
Watch me walk up in the spot and pull my cash out
Watch me walk up in the spot and pull my cash out

[Bridge]
I hit the border for some fuckin' new pants now
My niggas on the stage and you still in the damn crowd
Oh that's wicked, wicked, wicked, bitches prance now
I swear I saw some of 'em keepin' bands now
