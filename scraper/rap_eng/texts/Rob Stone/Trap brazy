Bitch don't talk about a last date
An yet my iPhone boomin cause of trap brazy
Bitch don't show up to my house late
Talking bout you got a new man but he outdated
New shoes all up in my house lately
I've been looking for a new house in the mountain
Still in rhyming when the drought brazy
I been placing orders I ain't touch a thing but champagne
New things just because of style brazy
Doing bad if a pussy nigga think he out weigh me
Who's that digger with a spouse lately
Still gon press up on his ass if he run his mouth brazy
I've been busting down on new kicks lately
Out of town with a new bitch and the friends hate it
Take him down ash another dead brazy
Niggas wanna wipe me out cause I've been the shit lately
Niggas ask me listen to their mixtape
Now I can't listen cause I know the shit stank
Bust it down write up on that mixtape
I know you like it how I come up with the shit way
Had your boy booted out the last show
Yea you was tryna run up run up on my last hoe
Fuck you think I'm out her getting cash for?
I'm back to back I'm making flip and double that doe
Bitch stop talking bout a last date
An yet my iPhone boomin cause of trap brazy
Bitch don't show up to my house late
Talking bout you got a new man but he outdated
New shoes all up in my house lately
I've been looking a new house in the mountains
Still been rhyming when the drought brazy
