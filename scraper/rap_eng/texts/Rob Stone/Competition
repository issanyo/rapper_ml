[Hook: CA$HPASSION]
Ey Shorty, in my own lane, no competition
I know you see me shining from a distance
When I drop by you ain't gon' miss me
Leave your girl around me she end up missin' (start it up)
I'm in my own lane, no competition
I'm in my own lane, no competition
Know you see me shining from a distance
Leave your girl around me she end up missin'

[Verse 1: CA$HPASSION]
They say that they love me
Got these haters looking dummy
Your main bitch, she wanna hug me
I'm too busy gettin' money
Keep it balling 'til my coffin
'Til the rooster calling every single morning
If it ain't about a dime, I ain't got the time
Lose me with that bullshit
I'm too busy out here grinding
Tryna stack and buy an island
Wanna take you somewhere private
Girl you in there or you ridin'?
I'ma cop a feel, pop a pill
Baby feel the silk, it's Italian
I pass on that if it ain't foreign
Pour a lil ac now I'm yawnin'

[Hook: CA$HPASSION]
Ey Shorty, in my own lane, no competition
I know you see me shining from a distance
When I drop by you ain't gon' miss me
Leave your girl round' me she end up missin'
I'm in my own lane, no competition
I'm in my own lane, no competition
Know you see me shining from a distance
Leave your girl around me she end up missin'

[Verse 2: Rob $tone]
Yeah, I'm in my lane, baby
I'm on the freeway doing any and I'm going crazy
Yeah, I make my own waves baby
Don't try and play me, I'm the greatest and you know it baby
No conversation with no bitches, 'bout my fucking paper
You playing witness, I don't feel it so I'll change it later
No competition from you niggas, I just cross my hands
My own lane got me feeling this way, yo

[Hook: CA$HPASSION]
Ey Shorty, in my own lane, no competition
I know you see me shining from a distance
When I drop by you ain't gon' miss me
Leave your girl around me she end up missin'
I'm in my own lane, no competition
I'm in my own lane, no competition
Know you see me shining from a distance
Leave your girl around me she end up missin'
