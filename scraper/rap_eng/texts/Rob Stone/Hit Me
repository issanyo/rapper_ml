Got that fire, hook you up
You looking sober, you need a buzz
You looking saggy, you need some love

[Verse 2: Rob $tone]
Baby hit me up, you know I got what you need
All kinds of flavors for my patient, but ain't shit here for free
I'm dropping ashes on my T, when she back ass up on me
I'm dropping baggage by the bitch
And picking bags up for me

These people staring up, just see my feet sole
I'm having lunch up with my people
What you need though? don't speak slow
