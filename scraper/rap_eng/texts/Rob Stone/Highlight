[Chorus: CA$HPASSION]
You ain't on the sideline, baby
You could be my highlight, baby
Moment of the night, replay
Will you be mine all day
You could be my highlight, baby
Could be my highlight, oh yeah yeah yeah
You could be my highlight, baby
Ain't no sideline, you the highlight

[Verse 1: CA$HPASSION]
Cruisin' down the highway, baby
Pull over to the side now, baby
I been gettin' cash all day
I been waitin' to smash all day
Hoes on my sideline waving
It's the weekend, let's get crazy
She just want to come backstage
She just tryna party with the gang
Roll up, pull the Act' out
I just want a reason to act out
Even with you, throw the past out
I just want a dose of you 'til I pass out

[Chorus: CA$HPASSION]
You ain't on the sideline, baby
You could be my highlight, baby
Moment of the night, replay
Will you be mine all day
You could be my highlight, baby
Could be my highlight, oh yeah yeah yeah
You could be my highlight, baby
Ain't no sideline, you the highlight

[Verse 2: Rob $tone]
You can be my highlight, baby
Kick it in the hotbox blazin'
Come kick it with a hot shot, you can get the spotlight
Everything you want, my lady
Even if you got a man
I can make you up and want to leave that nigga
Pull up in the Brinks, get green, drink liquor
Know I'm probably in the whip, don't need no permission
Girl just put your phone down, it's goin' down
Push up on me, Jim Jones now, I'm own now
It's a party at my home now, it's goin' down
Yeah I'm gettin' in my zone now, I'm zoned out
Girl just put your phone down, it's goin' down
Push up on me, Jim Jones now, I'm own now
It's a party at my home now, it's goin' down
Yeah I'm gettin' in my zone now, I'm zoned out

[Chorus: CA$HPASSION]
You ain't on the sideline, baby
You could be my highlight, baby
Moment of the night, replay
Will you be mine all day
You could be my highlight, baby
Could be my highlight, oh yeah yeah yeah
You could be my highlight, baby
Ain't no sideline, you the highlight

[Outro: Rob $tone]
Sit with me shawty, take a hit with me shawty
I know you feelin' kinda lonely, I'm the remedy shawty
You see the clock tock and it don't stop tickin'
I keep on turning up until the whole bottle missin'
Sit with me shawty, take a hit with me shawty
I know you feelin' kinda lonely, I'm the remedy shawty
You see the clock tock and it don't stop tickin'
I turn the party up until the whole bottle missin', gotta get it
