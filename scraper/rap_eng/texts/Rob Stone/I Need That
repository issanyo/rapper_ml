Stop playing pussy ass, fuck ass nigga
Pussy nigga, big pussy nigga, fuck

[Verse 1: Malik Burgers]
Stop playin' with me (stop playin' with me)
(Bitch I need more)
That bitch all in my ear, talkin' that shit I don't want to hear (I don't want to hear)
I'll make that dough come here (woah), girl, make that throat come here (gross)
Or you can disappear (why), gotta go, gotta go, gotta go (ha)
Heisman, stiff arm, you ain't in the game, you bench warmers (bench warmer)
I ain't even playin', I been started (I been started)
Pussy nigga wanna hate, now his bitch gone (bitch gone)
But a nigga gettin' paid, I don't even want it (no)

Another crib up for rent, so them bitches keep on callin' (money)

[Chorus: Rob $tone & Malik Burgers]
Yeah, tell these bitches, "Stop playin' with me" (stop playin' with me)
Hey, tell these hoes, "Stop playin'" (stop playin' with me)
I need bags, ayy, I need cash, ayy
I need bags, I need that, ayy
Yeah, tell these bitches, "Stop playin' with me" (stop playin' with me)
Yeah, tell these hoes, "Stop playin'" (stop playin')

[Verse 2: Rob $tone]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know my digits I'm 'bout (yeah)
Don't waste no time, I'm out to get it like a live in a drought (haha)
Pushing my wrist like a spout, the way it's drippin' about (it's drippin')
Who else got problems with me? Listen, I'ma finish it now (wait)
Don't waste no time, I'm out to get it, really meant what I shout (yeah)
I spent some time in Maui chillin' just to figure it out (haha)
You see, my thoughts be contradictin' when I chill on the couch (boy)
Like what's my problem? Why I'm chillin'? Gotta get to it now (what's my problem?)
I like my bitches astoundin', got a nasty ass round one (woah)
I'm ludicrous, but true to this, I feel so empowered (haha)
You niggas always watchin', well just give me an album (an album)
Watch my stats go up, no cappin', really live what i'm shoutin' (with them shoutin')
You thought I slipped, but guess again, I figured it out (out)
I'm calm within but I still tell a bitch what I'm 'bout ('bout)
I'm all about my chips, I'm here to get it, no doubt (doubt)
The top is on my list of shit to hit 'fore I'm out (yeah)

[Chorus: Rob $tone & Malik Burgers]
Yeah, tell these bitches, "Stop playin' with me" (stop playin' with me)
Hey, tell these hoes, "Stop playin'" (stop playin' with me)
I need bags, ayy, I need cash, ayy
I need bags, I need that, ayy
Yeah, tell these bitches, "Stop playin' with me" (stop playin' with me)
Yeah, tell these hoes, "Stop playin'" (stop playin')
I need bags, ayy, I need cash, ayy
I need bags, I need that, ayy
