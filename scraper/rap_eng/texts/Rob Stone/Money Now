[Chorus]
Gettin' money, I get money now
I got bitches out here trippin', wanna fly 'em out
I ain't talkin' shit but money now
All these niggas out here bitchin' 'cause they run arounds
Told the label need my money now
And I ain't trippin', I just play my shit and they aroused
I ain't talkin' shit but money now
Keep your distance, niggas switch up when your money pile

[Verse 1]
You niggas pocket pinching, I live with consequences
My heart a lion but bigger, I'm up, all odds against me
My wrist stupendous but nothing here has been artifical
My mission simple, it's riches and health for la famila
My motors windows on continentals that's presidential
I mean it's simple, you get the checks if you be the realest
I popped a seal, had to count up blessings and knock some denims
I've dipped in rentals, I've got blamed, I've did my diligence
You must be kidding, I'm not considering you little niggas
Who really chillin', no hustle 'bout you, boy you ain't with it
My Glock extended, you pocket pinching, I'll set it in there
You wishin', trippin' 'cause I'm the man and your job is gritty
Don't stop the bitchin' 'cause it just make me go harder and it
I'm winnin', my business is always handled but never missin'
My pockets thicken, my pops is living, my mom is chilling
My son is happy, his mama winnin', said that I'm the illest

[Chorus]
Gettin' money, I get money now
I got bitches out here trippin', wanna fly 'em out
I ain't talkin' shit but money now
All these niggas out here bitchin' 'cause they run arounds
Told the label need my money now
And I ain't trippin', I just play my shit and they aroused
I ain't talkin' shit but money now
Keep your distance, niggas switch up when your money pile

[Verse 2]
Yeah I'm the illest, don't need a doctor, I need my Henny
I'm always in it, if people question, who out to get it?
I'm politicking with politicians on yachts and Bentleys
Just bought a Bentley, put nothing other than Grove up in it
The shots of Remy just hit my kidney but never slippin'
You niggas trippin', you act like bitches
Lil' boy, you keepin' tabs from a distance
I need ram, someone in it
You ain't fam, you the enemy

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' money, I get money now
I got bitches out here trippin', wanna fly 'em out
I ain't talkin' shit but money now
All these niggas out here bitchin' 'cause they run arounds
Told the label need my money now
And I ain't trippin', I just play my shit and they aroused
I ain't talkin' shit but money now
Keep your distance, niggas switch up when your money pile

[Outro]
Yeah nigga
It's 1207 to the motherfuckin' top bitch
It's 1207-teen, I done told you motherfuckers already, yeah
