Ay, Ay, Ay

I been getting too faded
Flirting with a bitch too brazy
In a tail getting bent no chaser
All the hoes no chasing
Smoking out the wood no paper
I dipped from the bitch
What flavour she a dud
Won't say it
I don't love the bitch I hate her
Yeah I'm taking risks
I'm taking what I'm living
Like greatness
Can't understand my haters
I can't understand if it ain't about paper
Moves greater
Stepping on a bitch white gators
When she dancing on my dick
Can see her hips stop shaking
I'mma take in this spasm until my dick start aching
I'mma pass enough back there and a bitch I'm dating

Woah 50 grand in the rental
Big boss man, big bands from the business
New Corvette for my mans when we get it
I been saying go the side, go stay when we winning
Yeah lady, woah

I can't hear what you sayin' (what?)
Can't give a fuck what you think
I'm way too faded
I been sipping my drank
Smoking all night with my gang
Getting hit with my gang
Licking that model cute face
Drinking out the bottle D'usse
Now I'm on a whole new wave
I can't hear what you sayin'
Can't give a fuck what you think
I'm way too faded, faded, yeah
I'm getting too faded (faded, too faded)
I'm getting too faded (faded, too faded)
I'm getting too faded (faded, too faded)

P-Low I'm too cocky, ooh
Chef put the rich young habachi, ooh
Jesus I sleep with no hockey
Make your girl get loaded
You already know the -
The girl from the Bay downright testy
All the bad bitches call me sexy
Bitch I'm the number one requested
She whisper in my ear
Told me let's dip (skkrrrt, skkkkrt, skrrrt) aye
Yo, so I dashed back there
No I can't I can't trickle nuts, aye
I just put it on the top layer
Coupe, showed her tits, top player
BItch we nut there
We the real ones
Got the whole shell locked
Got it sealed up, yeah
Yo I'm funding this bitch though
If she ain't got no funds
Let the bitch go, aye

I can't hear what you sayin' (what?)
Can't give a fuck what you think
I'm way too faded
I been sipping my drank
Smoking all night with my gang
Getting hit with my gang
Licking that model cute face
Drinking out the bottle D'usse
Now I'm on a whole new wave
I can't hear what you sayin'
Can't give a fuck what you think
I'm way too faded, faded, yeah
I'm getting too faded (faded, too faded)
I'm getting too faded (faded, too faded)
I'm getting too faded (faded, too faded)
