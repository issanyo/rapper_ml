[Chorus]
Baby, yeah let me talk to you
Dance with no walkthrough
Do my grown man for you
Hold my hand, baby, talk to me
Spill out all your thoughts to me
Girl, let me talk to you
Let me be there in the dark
Hope you etch me in your heart
Hope you remember where it start at
Remember where we grew apart at?
Why you treat me like a doormat?
Baby, yeah let me talk to you
Dance with no walkthrough
Do my grown man for you
Hold my hand, baby, talk to me
Spill out all your thoughts to me
Girl, let me talk to you
Let me be there in the dark
Hope you etch me in your heart
Hope you remember where it start at
Remember where we grew apart at?
Why you treat me like a doormat?

[Verse 1]
Do you remember where we first met?
Do you remember where I took you when you bought that?
They don't love you when you all that
Know they would curse me if I told 'em, I'ma fall back
Do you know right where the heart at?
Do you know how much you care, well I'm off that?
They don't love you when you all that
I hope they hate it when I make it and don't call back

[Chorus]
Baby, yeah let me talk to you
Dance with no walkthrough
Do my grown man for you
Hold my hand, baby, talk to me
Spill out all your thoughts to me
Girl, let me talk to you
Let me be there in the dark
Hope you etch me in your heart
Hope you remember where it start at
Remember where we grew apart at?
Why you treat me like a doormat?

[Verse 2]
Maybe let you hold a band for me
Say I don't trust you, girl, I know that's just a test, right?
Baby girl you the baddest one
I know you fuckin' with me only 'cause I'm next up
Do you remember what my text was?
Do you remember when I told you I'm the blessed one?
You my world, well you damn was
See I can't love you no more, you give fake love

[Chorus]
Baby, yeah let me talk to you
Dance with no walkthrough
Do my grown man for you
Hold my hand, baby, talk to me
Spill out all your thoughts to me
Girl, let me talk to you
Let me be there in the dark
Hope you etch me in your heart
Hope you remember where it start at
Remember where we grew apart at?
Why you treat me like a doormat?
Baby, yeah let me talk to you
Dance with no walkthrough
Do my grown man for you
Hold my hand, baby, talk to me
Spill out all your thoughts to me
Girl, let me talk to you
Let me be there in the dark
Hope you etch me in your heart
Hope you remember where it start at
Remember where we grew apart at?
Why you treat me like a doormat?
