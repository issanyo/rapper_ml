And this bad bitch just

[Hook: Rob $tone]
She said, “Ouu, you’s a big shot, right?
Let’s take a picture tonight
I got all my friends with me in here tonight
They wanna drink all night"
She said, “Do you have some weed that I can light?
I barely drink but not tonight
Are you here for the weekend or the night?
I just might creep with you tonight”

[Verse 1: Rob $tone]
Girl you wanna get with me tonight
You wanna sleep with me, just squeeze me til I’m tired
Well girl I think you sweet, I’m what you like
Just know I’m not the one to ever treat you right
But girl I got some weed that you can light
You roll my sticky up, so lick me up tonight
She bounced to the back, don't trust a bitch who bad
I poured up shots of Henny, got it twisted, then I laugh

[Verse 2: Thommed Cruz]
Look, I just might hit the first night
Thommed Cruz might be fucking your wife
If so, then I might hit it twice
But don't worry, Burger, the bitch ain’t mine
And I ain’t gonna flex
Let me talk about the neck
How the chick was the best, yea
And these bitches ain’t shit
But I been said this shit
And they ain’t worth a zip, yeah
Hey, speaking of zips, roll up a wood, I'm tryin' to get lifted
Henny on ice wit a lil' lemonade, that's my beverage
They said don't do it but I had to go and do it
You niggas ain’t gang, bitch
Don't come my section
Knockout, knocking heads, bitch

[Hook: Rob $tone]
She said “Ouu, you's a big shot, right?

I'm getting money, I’ma spend it, but won't spend it on you
Yup
But got some weed for ya
And here's a drink for when you wanna turn it up and get loose
