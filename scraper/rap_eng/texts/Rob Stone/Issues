Got that .40 by my side, yeah
You know that I miss you
But there's money on my mind, yeah
They don't want the issue if they tryna take my life, yeah
Loadin' up the pistol if they tryna take my life, yeah

They don't want the issue if they tryna take my life, yeah
Loadin' up the pistol if they tryna take my life, yeah

[Verse 1: Heartbreaka]
I know they tryna take me down
Yeah man they love to see me fall
'Cus even your closest homies ain't gon' wanna see you ball
I'm gridin' like no tomorrow
I'm workin' like it's my job
I'm flippin' to make it back
Reverse it and take it off
Now I'm stuntin', I'm flexin'
Sometimes I hate my reflection
Can't leave the house without stressin'
That's why I carry my weapon
Gotta carry one for the haters
Gotta carry two for my baby
My momma think that I'm crazy
You know these streets could be shady
That's why I'm praying for another day
Know that I can't catch a break
One for my homies gone
Know they love this Hennessy
Know my girl gon' miss me bruh
She could have what left of me
This .40 by my side I got it aimin' towards my enemies

[Chorus: Heartbreaka]

[Verse 2: Rob $tone]
Yeah, yeah
They wanna lock me up just stop me
But no not today
I'm on my way
?
They tried to get me with a Glock
But there's no stoppin' this
My life is on full throttle
Off the bottle I've been sippin' lately
Yeah I've been trippin' lately
Lonely on my mission lately
All about my dollars, damn
My diamonds got me trippin' lately
They tried to hit me with a shot
?
I'll give it all I got
All I got no problem
Don't lie to me
Bitches always lie to me
Don't cry to me
Listen when I lie to you
How fast would you run away from life
?

[Verse 3: Yung Jae]
Nah, they ain't tryna to see me shine
Like I done made it overnight
Like I ain't gridin' all my life
To turn these wrongs into right
I'm paranoid that they come get me
So I'm holdin' on that nine
I'm gettin' head from my bitch
To get a lil' piece of mind
From when I wake up, wake up
I get my cake up, cake up
But every dollar I'm makin'
It gettin' faker, faker
And if they tryna take my life
I keep that pistol by my side
It's like a happy home
It's something I done made up in my mind
I'm on that Codeine
It got me throwed off
My lil homie got canned by the 0, dawg
I'm smoking 'dro, dawg
It keep me goin', dawg
I gotta shine
'Cus I know my life is so dark
Oh Lord
