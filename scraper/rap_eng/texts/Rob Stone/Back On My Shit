[Verse]
I guess they said I ain't been real lately
But now I'm back up in this bitch 'cause I been goin' crazy
I been so stuck inside my head, I been ignoring patience
But never once have I feel off and haven't kept it wavey, yeah
You see but this is how it's goin' lately
I been too patient, now it's time to make these people pay me
Fuck all you labels, I ain't going out without my paper
You want to wind the clock, not me because I'm too creative
You can drop me but not stop me if I'm still creatin'
You may have got me but it's not the way you thought you played it
Who else don't want me 'cause I'm worth more than what you pay me
I ain't fell off, my shit got blocked because they couldn't take it
Whip out my baby, that's my son man, that's my fuckin' greatness
How could you take what's on this plate and ask me why I'm angry
And is it shitty you ain't never been up to my city
You played my worst song out then tried to say you did it
Man you ain't know, this ain't a hoax, you niggas found me like this
This ain't a joke, and this ain't hope, you niggas made me write this
I ain't got time for all these games, thought you was ready for this
It's 1207 to the top and don't you ever forget
Go ahead and drop me, watch me blossom with no radio hits
This ain't no radio shit, my life is really like this
And I ain't jabbin', this ain't gossip, bitch it's really like this
And y'all ain't answer when I called you now I'm back on my shit, yeah (It's 1207, to the top, boy)
This is how it's goin' lately
I still ain't starving, I'm a baller, but we still ain't gravy, yeah
Yeah, this is how it's goin' lately
Just want my dollars, don't want problems, I don't want the favors
Yeah, this is how it's goin' lately
I know you hate it, but you made it right, you made me write this
My life is really like this
Took the right risk, now I'm back on my shit, yeah

[Outro]
Don't wait for it
