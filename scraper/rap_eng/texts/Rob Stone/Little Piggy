[Intro: Rob $tone]
Yeah
Let's get it (yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Rob $tone]
Run little piggy, run little piggy
I don't wanna die by a piggy
Run up off his gun
Run little niggas, they just wanna shun on my niggas
Lock us up and let us burn
Run little piggy, run little piggy
I don't wanna die by a piggy
Run up off his gun
Run little niggas, they just wanna shun on my niggas
Lock us up and let us burn

[Verse 1: Rob $tone]
Burn, burn, they'll watch me burn
They turn right on the people when the people question them
You better run, gun, they shoot for fun
They marked up all the bullets for the Blacks and Mexicans
And I don't love, none, don't fuck with them
Police be out to get you if you Black just on the run
And I ain't even got a gun, and I ain't even cock my gun
They shot me anyway 'cause I attacked 'em, but with what?
And I don't love, none, don't fuck with them
Police be out to get you if you flashing and you stunting
And I don't love none, don't fuck with them
They gon' lock me away before this song is fucking done

[Hook]
Run little piggy, run little piggy
I don't wanna die by a piggy
Run up off his gun
Run little niggas, they just wanna shun on my niggas
Lock us up and let us burn
Run little piggy, run little piggy
I don't wanna die by a piggy
Run up off his gun
Run little niggas, they just wanna shun on my niggas
Lock us up and let us burn

[Verse 2: Meechy Darko]
This little piggy is heartless
This little piggy got a cartridge
This little piggy go "blow, blow, blow"
Nicely hooked up by the corners
Now your body is all red
Look like you model for Target
Pardon, its Meechy Darko, young and heartless
Last nigga that tried me, God can't even find him
What's next? Hit your ex
Like I found treasure on a island
Diamonds look like lightning
Red dots from the rooftops
Now we talking bout high beams
Intercourse with the divine freaks?
Double Westside, then she ride me
Then I kill the kitty - That 9 piece
California Love on my leopard rug
2 Cup Shakur - Need a bigger blunt
Haters gon' keep hatin', hoes gon' keep fucking
Money gon' keep printing
That's why a nigga keep hustlin'
No pork on my fork
But there's blood on my knife
Zombie Gang fuck ya life (yikes)
Swerve left to wrong rights (hmm)
No pork on my fork
But there's blood on my knife
Zombie Gang fuck ya life (yikes)
Swerve left to wrong rights (oooh)

[Hook: Rob $tone]
Run little piggy, run little piggy
I don't wanna die by a piggy
Run up off his gun
Run little niggas, they just wanna shun on my niggas
Lock us up and let us burn
Run little piggy, run little piggy
I don't wanna die by a piggy
Run up off his gun
Run little niggas, they just wanna shun on my niggas
Lock us up and let us burn
