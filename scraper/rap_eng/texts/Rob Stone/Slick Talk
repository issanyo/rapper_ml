[Intro: Marty Baller]
Yeah
Hello (whoa)
I'm Marty Baller (Yeah)

[Chorus: Marty Baller]
Let a nigga talk slick, we gon hit him up
Duffel bag, Louie Vuitton how we zip em up
Pussy nigga mans gon lift'em up
Call a Uber man and he gon pick'em up
I ain't high right now bout to light it up
Like a doggy, I'm a bone, I'm a bite it up (Uuoo)
Got ya chick, she at my crib, I'm 'bout to pipe it up
She a dog and I'm a bone cuz she like to fuck

[Verse 1: Rob $tone]
Yeah
Baby kinda bad but ain't no wifin' up
Yeah im look'n like a star, my neck is tatted up
Get to guala gang greedy, I been eatin' up
I'm the man I guess, I'm jiggy and I'm rad as fuck
Yeah I'm boolin' in the backyard baggin' up
I know the bad ones want to get me, I been killin' huh
Get a tissue nigga, you just lookin' sad as fuck
Bitches miss me, in their feelings, never answer them

[Bridge: Rob $tone]
I'm out in Canada, managa
Keep on picking the baggage up
All on camera, stamina
When I'm racking my stackies up, see
Me, bitch I look spectacular
My whole swag is immaculate and damaging
Pussy niggas thinkin', we won't ram him up
Bitch I'mma put the fuckin' clip in, then I'm blamin' em
Get to bubbling nigga, please you just be handed'em
Stuck on the knees, your bitch was bad, you know I had to fuck

[Verse 2: Marty Baller]
Pussy nigga run up and he gettin' hit
I'm MC Hammer with the hammer, too legit to quit
Check my hoodie, check my jeans, I know you like my fit
I'm Barry Bonds, got your girl and I'm about to hit
Dammit, I just came up with another hit
Its baller game and 1207, you know we run this shit
You run your lip, I got that grip and I will let it rip
You my son and I will put you on the punishment
And Nike Town, just so you now I'm gettin' money bitch
Got me laughing to the bank, I'm on some funny shit
Got these racks all up on me, you ain't gettin' none of it
You ain't wifey girl, you know you let my brother hit

[Chorus: Marty Baller]
Let a nigga talk slick, we gon hit him up
Duffel bag, Louie Vuitton how we zip em up
Pussy nigga mans gon lift'em up
Call a Uber man and he gon pick'em up
I ain't high right now bout to light it up
Like a doggy, I'm a bone, I'm a bite it up (Uuoo)
Got ya chick, she at my crib, I'm 'bout to pipe it up
She a dog and I'm a bone cuz she like to fuck
