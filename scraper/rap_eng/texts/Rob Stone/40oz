[Intro]
Yeah, just because I always do this exchange
Look, aye, yeah

[Verse 1]
Rhymes in my head as siphon through this mail
You know description on the prescription it’s dimes in my bed
She was left for dead, left the sheets all red
Fell asleep, we discrete and delete, all thread
I’m addicted to these bitches, ah man
Oh damn you can’t face a bitch we breaking all bread
Yow the posse’s locked, scared to come across us
Paranoid author cause I smoke like [?]
Yeah we get it poppin they count on us to pop shit
BBP bitch where money is the object
It ain’t no other option if bitches start robbing
Make it fast then get the cash and then start robbing
I’ve always been about it, just ask who I ride around with
The same niggas with me the same niggas I’m down with
I’m getting paid, getting laid and changing outfits
Niggas don’t change but really ain’t even ‘bout shit nigga

[Hook]
I got a 40oz of liquor
I’m gonna pour up with your sister
An oz o Gat so we gon pour up in a swisher
Just me and all my niggas
And just me and all my bitches
They beg us to come and kick it
Cause niggas know how we get it
I got a 40oz of liquor
I’m gonna pour up with your sister
An oz o Gat so we gon pour up in a swisher
Just me and all my niggas
And just me and all my bitches
They beg us to come and kick it
Cause niggas know how we get it

[Verse 2]
I ain’t fucking with you lame niggas
I won’t come around, don’t fuck around
Just hack up all the lines nigga
And I ain’t fucking with no lame bitches
There ain’t no come around
Don’t around unless money on the way with you
Dang young rapper up on the wave nigga
And now I hop up off the bands and drink my sunny Gucci babe Winnie
But damn these haters in my face tripping
I think I need to keep the blade I’m cutting heads off the snakes with it
And now they talk about racism
They always talk about the rage and then lock us in a cage, finished
You always with the glitz and glamour but you never with the action
Wanna talk be real with you then face the truth
Now I’m post to put my feet up in the traffic
In the back throwing bags with my slaps on the tracklist
And all you niggas fake trap shit
You making drug music but you being drugged by a rap bitch
And all the hittas know I’m dabbed in
The black kids to the Latins, the Asians and they rad friends
A big booty black bitch in a black Benz
Baggin up the bundles by the bay in the back lit
Trizz done got me back on rap shit
I need the Forbes list, the fat crib, the ‘Rrari and the catfish
My momma told me that I had gifts
I hit the scene and then grab quick
I’m back on the attack bitch

[Hook]
I got a 40oz of liquor
I’m gonna pour up with your sister
An oz o Gat so we gon pour up in a swisher
Just me and all my niggas
And just me and all my bitches
They beg us to come and kick it
Cause niggas know how we get it
I got a 40oz of liquor
I’m gonna pour up with your sister
An oz o Gat so we gon pour up in a swisher
Just me and all my niggas
And just me and all my bitches
They beg us to come and kick it
Cause niggas know how we get it

[Outro]
Nigga, yeah that shit hard
