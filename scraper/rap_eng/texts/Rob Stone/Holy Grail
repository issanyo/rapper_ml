[Intro: Rob $tone]
Young Rob $tone up in this bitch, nigga
I just gotta let y'all niggas know
I got my brother, Baby Burgers up in this mother fucker
God damn to the top, boy

[Chorus: Rob $tone]
Holy Grail, you watch your bitch cause I got hoes for sale
Going well, I’m on my shit so I be doing well
Story tails, you’ll tell the cops look boy, I know you will
I’m burning down the bridge now
I got my brothers but you hope we fail

[Verse 1: Malik Brugers]
Please don't make me have to fuck your day up
Switching lanes and then I double up
We ain't the same and you ain't one of us
I ain't worried bout none of ya
These niggas lame and you know it
I come back and show up with
That we ain't the ones to be fucking with
Smoke if you [?] bitch
'96 Cadillac coup
Riding around tryna cool and your bitch know she choosing
Lovin' on you but she fuck with the group
I can't fuck with no bitch if she's stupid
You know how we do it
This shit is easy like signing to Ruthless
And not that many can relate
This for the days I promised that we'll see better days
That nigga a heavy weight
Fix the game, you ain't gotta hate
Pussy nigga, you was in my way
Pussy nigga, you could not relate
You ain't even in my spot today
Woke up feeling like the man
Then I walked up in the mirror
I said "Damn, you that nigga"
Then my mirror said "Same"
You ain't even in my lane
You could never say I changed
You ain't fucking with the gang
I can't forget where I came
Bet they gon' know all my name
Bet they gon' know where I came
Can't throw no dirt on my name
Bet they gon' know all my name

[Chorus: Rob $tone]
Holy Grail, you watch your bitch cause I got hoes for sale
Going well, I’m on my shit so I be doing well
Story tails, you’ll tell the cops look boy I know you will
I’m burning down the bridge now
I got my brothers but you hope we fail

[Verse 2: Rob $tone]
Nigga tell me who wanted with me
Cop a gram nigga, you ain’t really wanted with me
I pull up, hop out, leave blood on the scene
I pour up, pass out, then I’m up for the week
About it, getting guala that’s double the G
Gucci belt look great, that’s double the G
I pull up, need cash, ain’t none for free
Ladies love my style but I thug and ya get it
About it, Young Rob off the block now
Getting pack for the way that I pop out
In a way, that’s a fade, that’s a knock out
Yea I paid for the whip on a rock now, stop now
Y'all niggas need to stop now, shit
How you turn in to a op now? Bitch
Every morning check accounts now
In my breaks in the way when I type now, pipe down

[Chorus: Rob $tone]
Holy Grail, you watch your bitch cause I got hoes for sale
Going well, I’m on my shit so I be doing well
Story tails, you’ll tell the cops look boy I know you will
I’m burning down the bridge now
I got my brothers but you hope we fail
