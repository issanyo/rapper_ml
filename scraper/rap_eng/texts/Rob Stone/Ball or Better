[Intro: Rob $tone]
To the top, boy!

[Verse 1: Rob $tone]
I took your bitch to Atlanta (haha), I get to smoke bricks in the Fanta (yeah, yeah)
Can't kiss no bitch on camera (yeah), she suck my dick on camera (hey, hey)
Can't trust no bitch, not never (haha), my mom taught me so better
My pop said, "Son, go get it", my son said, "Dad, you winnin'"
Look bitch, I said go get it (haha), no breaks, I needa go-getter (yeah)
Got Fendi on my sweater, I'm trendin' all on Twitter
I hit this B like Tiller, I made her leave, no effort
I'm spendin' on Margiela, love women from Marbella
I took so many Henny shots, you can't get on my level (ay)
I got so many big-ass rocks all right here on my bezel (hey)
Ain't no decision, I stay dunkin', only ball or better
Dismiss yo' bitch, she just want clout, she gave it all her effort (to the top, boy)

[Chorus: Rob $tone]
Yeah, ball or better, feel like a holiday (haha)
Yeah, how you not gettin' paid? It's like a thousand ways
Yeah, I'm always flexin', ain't got no time for the breaks
Yeah, I'm all about my Benjis, hate to be so frank
Yeah, ball or better, feel like a holiday
Yeah, how you not gettin' paid? It's like a thousand ways (why you broke?)
Yeah, I'm always flexin', ain't got no time for the breaks (no time)
Yeah, I'm all about my Benjis, hate to be so frank

[Verse 2: J. Davi$]
Look at my wrist, look at my neck, look at my bitch, bitch look at my set (my set)
Lookin' insane, diamonds all over my rings (rings), diamonds all over my chains (my chains)
Give me the chart, hol' up bitch, give me the work, I got the take of the purse (the purse)
Give me the pills, give me a bitch with some heels, and I'ma turn that to some mil's
'Cause I'ma go get it, Davi$ go get it and spend it
Spend it and go get some more, bitch I'm on parole
So I do my dirt on my own, 'cause nothing I do on the low
Lookin' like damn, lookin' like bitch, goddamn ooh, you the motherfuckin' man
Look like a lick, look at yo' bitch on my dick
Look how I'm still with the shit 'cause every day proper
Your bitch she callin' me "poppa", choppa be singin' like opera
Niggas is bitches, niggas be actin' like bitches, put that on God be my witness (ay)
Niggas is bitches, niggas be actin' like bitches, put that on God be my witness (ay)
Niggas is bitches, niggas be actin' like bitches, put that on God be my witness (ay)
Lil bitch!

[Chorus: Rob $tone]
Ball or better, feel like a holiday
Yeah, how you not gettin' paid? It's like a thousand ways
Yeah, I'm always flexin', ain't got no time for the breaks
Yeah, I'm all about my Benjis, hate to be so frank
Yeah, ball or better, feel like a holiday
Yeah, how you not getting patties like a thousand ways (why you broke?)
Yeah, I'm always flexin', ain't got no time for the breaks (no time)
Yeah, I'm all about my Benji's, hate to be so frank
