[Verse 1]
Let me tell you something, nigga, I’m about my business, don't argue with me
And I ain’t saying I’m the realest, but the people here are so caught up with me
I’m just saying, little nigga, I just order shrimp and new cups of Remy
Break the bank on a nigga, we all gonna eat, my whole squad is winning

[Hook]
When I pull up, pop up, flexing, paparazzi come and get me
Bring bottle to my section, I got models in my section
That bitch gonna come caress me, I’ma swat, if she let me
My arm got VVSs, need the army to correct me

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you a little something, let me tell you something about me
All my cars imported, there’s LSD up in my tea
And my [?] abnormal, I’m colder but I’m still a wild thing
Can’t pass on me, gorgeous, and focus in on what I’m saying
Let me tell you a little something, let me tell you something about me
All my cars imported, there’s LSD up in my tea
And my [?] abnormal, I’m colder but I’m still a wild thing
Can’t pass on me, gorgeous, and focus in on what I’m saying

[Hook]
When I pull up, pop up, flexing, paparazzi come and get me
Bring bottle to my section, I got models in my section
That bitch gonna come caress me, I’ma swat, if she let me
My arm got VVSs, need the army to correct me

[Verse 3]
Young [?] get the money, I got business with the money
Baby gonna spend for me, throw it back and live for me
Bow, bow
I’m in the corner, in the ‘lac I’m bendin’ corners
Know you wanna tell the truth, I know you want me
Pow, pow
I been on it, break it down and live for me
Tell the truth I know you hate and know you want me
I’m wild I’m still [?], all my life I've been thuggin’
I’ma run it up and stack it to the [?]

[Hook]
When I pull up, pop up, flexing, paparazzi come and get me
Bring bottle to my section, I got models in my section
That bitch gonna come caress me, I’ma swat, if she let me
My arm got VVSs, need the army to correct me

[Hook]
When I pull up, pop up, flexing, paparazzi come and get me
Bring bottle to my section, I got models in my section
That bitch gonna come caress me, I’ma swat, if she let me
My arm got VVSs, need the army to correct me
