[Hook 3x]
Hoe, get a (?)
Just make it bounce on my fuckin' vintage couch
Just get the count, hit the snow, and then let's bounce, yeah
See this my house, got your bitch up in my house

[Verse]
Got a coke white blouse on my coke white spouse
Copped a coke white couch for my coke white Calvin's
Got a coke white mountain on my coke white canvas
Lip-lockin' Spanish bitches, pissed off
Get to walkin' hoe, don't act like I don't fuck it up
I do it super awesome hoe, don't act like you ain't callin' me up
Now get out my ride, don't dare to kick ya feet up
I'm real specific, when I spit it, I don't even speak up

[Hook 3x]
Hoe, get a (?)
Just make it bounce on my fuckin' vintage couch
Just get the count, hit the snow, and then let's bounce, yeah
See this my house, got your bitch up in my house
