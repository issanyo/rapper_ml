[Intro]
My nigga MooXe
Yeah, uh, yeah yeah
Yuh, to the top boy!

[Chorus]
Tell these bitches stop playin' wit' me
Ho, I'm the man, and I'm just goin' 'bout my damn business
Bad bitches, bad bitches, damn, them bitches bad business
Ho, I don't wanna talk, you fucked all of my mans, didn't you?
Pay attention, pay attention, ho, you better pay attention
See this a lay-up, better pay up, 'bout my cash, nigga
Bad bitches, bad business, damn, I love them bad bitches
But I don't chase 'em, only chase after my bag nigga (for my bag nigga)

[Verse]
Yup, only chase after the bag
Bitches always wanna talk but I can't deal with that, ah
Yup, too persisent with the swag
Gucci in my duffel, she got Fendi for the bag, wha'
Stunt, suckin' niggas make me laugh
Slide up on a lil' bitch and slide up off the map
And she act right, lil' tits but I ain't even mad
Got the cash right, good wrist, and rub me on my back, ah, yeah
Yeah, and that's a winner, been lit since the beginning
All my dogs hopped out the kennel
I've been fuckin' up my kidneys, takin' shots with flocks of bitches
I've been on the road to riches with my brothers, them my niggas
Ah, yeah, I wouldn't dare to leave a witness
Wouldn't dare to spare you niggas
It ain't fair the way I'm killin' shit (the way I'm killin' shit)
Ahhh, I wouldn't profess to groupie bitches
Comin' with a droopy vision, tunnel toward a new percentage

[Chorus]
Tell these bitches stop playin' wit' me
Ho, I'm the man, and I'm just goin' 'bout my damn business
Bad bitches, bad bitches, damn, them bitches bad business
Ho, I don't wanna talk, you fucked all of my mans, didn't you?
Pay attention, pay attention, ho, you better pay attention
See this a lay-up, better pass by my cash, nigga
Bad bitches, bad business, damn, I love them bad bitches
But I don't chase 'em, only chase after my bag nigga (for my bag nigga)

[Outro]
Ayy, I want my bag nigga
Mmm, yeah, I need the bag nigga
Ayy, yeah, I need the bag nigga
Yeah, yeah
