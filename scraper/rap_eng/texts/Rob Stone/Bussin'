[Intro]
Ayy, all my niggas in E-raq
Yeah, hmhm, ayy
Yeah
My nigga MooXe
Haha, all my niggas in E-raq, yeah
Yeah, uh
Yeah, uh, uh
It's 1207 to the top, boy
Let's get it, let's get it, let's get it

[Chorus]
Bussin', bitch, I'm bussin' diamonds out
My wrist look like a large amount
Got bitches on me crawlin', wanna buss' it
I'm bussin' out the bottle for my niggas, we be wildin' out
A nigga got a problem we gon' buss' him
Bussin' down my Mama house, I busted out the town
And now they hatin', I just call 'em little busters
Bussin', bussin', ballin' out, my VVS is [?]
Your bitch all on my nuts and I'ma buss' her

[Verse]
Look, I'll take my time if you could get me what I like
Them titties sittin' on you nice
We gettin' litty for the night with no discussion
Any given time, a nigga trippin', he can die
I didn't get it, why he try me? So unlucky
You niggas suck, I don't want nothin'
Not a bucket, chicken nugget
Not a motherfuckin' slut who don't know nothin'
But still, I'm runnin' up my duckets
In the paint, I'm causin' ruckus
From the 3, I'm gettin' motherfuckin' buckets
Get straight to it, no lackin'
Pop my shit, I ain't even gonna brag
I just popped ten, I ain't lookin' at tags
You a broke ass bitch, ain't gettin' no cash
I just got rich, I ain't givin' that back
That's not my bitch, I ain't goin' outside
I pop my shit, I ain't even gonna brag, nah
Damn, just do it, all gas and my diamonds drippin'
When I'm dippin', whippin', spinnin' the Aston
I'm slidin' on a bitch who turnin' 50 but bad
She funny, tell me if I give her dick she'll give me a mansion, ha

[Chorus]
Bussin', bitch, I'm bussin' diamonds out
My wrist look like a large amount
Got bitches on me crawlin', wanna buss' it
I'm bussin' out the bottle for my niggas, we be wildin' out
A nigga got a problem we gon' buss' him
Bussin' down my Mama house, I busted out the town
And now they hatin', I just call 'em little busters
Bussin', bussin', ballin' out, my VVS is [?]
Your bitch all on my nuts and I'ma buss' her
