[Intro: Rob $tone]
Aye (ow)
Aye (yeah)
Haha, yeah
Uh (ow)

[Chorus: Rob $tone]
Got heat? (Got heat, aye)
I bagged a pretty bitch right off the street (right off the street)
Yeah, I told her look, not me (not me)
I am not the one to put a ring on it (to put a ring on it)
Yeah, but she gon' let me put the team on it (team on it)
And I don't like a wood without some weed on it (yeah)
All night stack green hunnids (I stack green hunnids)
All up on the map, I put the team on it (yeah, yeah)
Got heat? (Got heat, aye)
I bagged a pretty bitch right off the street (right off the street)
Yeah, I told her look, not me (not me)
I am not the one to put a ring on it (to put a ring on it)

[Verse 1: Rob $tone]
You can't get no love, so don't get comfy with me (comfy with me)
I just bought some duff that had her up for a week (up for a week)
Doobies hurt my thumb, but I'm still thumbin' through green (uh)
And baby, you been actin' up but up in the club every week (what?)
But see me, I be [?] now see I'm just up right on the mountain (yeah)
Ever since I started cashin' I got hated on and doubted
Put her face up in the mattress, when I flip it, dig it out
My neck look like some water, steady drippin' out the spout
Man, I got bitches at the house, I met these bitches in the lobby
They took drugs and want to party, so I had to get it started
Roll my weed and take a puff, this gas could start the Maserati
I been seein' how you niggas lookin', always tryna to stop me
I got bitches at the house, I met these bitches in the lobby
They took drugs and want to party, so I had to get it started
Roll my weed and take a puff, this gas could start the Maserati
I been seein' how you niggas lookin', always tryna stomp me out, damn

[Chorus: Rob $tone]
Got heat? (Got heat, aye)
I bagged a pretty bitch right off the street (right off the street)
Yeah, I told her look, not me (not me)
I am not the one to put a ring on it (to put a ring on it)
Yeah, but she gon' let me put the team on it (team on it)
And I don't like a wood without some weed on it (yeah)
All night stack green hunnids (I stack green hunnids)
All up on the map, I put the team on it (yeah, yeah)
Got heat? (Got heat, aye)
I bagged a pretty bitch right off the street (right off the street)
Yeah, I told her look, not me (not me)
I am not the one to put a ring on it (to put a ring on it), yeah

[Verse 2: Ant Beale]
Aye, I got my hater blockers on (on)
Dime on my arm, check the forecast I seen money
And I can't lie, I'm so fly (fly)
Take the fit off I might plummet (might plummet, woah), yeah
My money make her moan, she gon' fuck me 'cause she grown
'Cause she know I might spend a little money
Yeah, I gave that hoe a loan, told her, "Cop a new phone"
And she better answer anytime I want it (yeah)
Go goofy with the Benz, ooh twenty in my hand
Check the bag with a hunnid in my luggage
Yeah, I'm Hefe with the tracks, Jeff Gordon with the laps
And I got it, do a private dance in public (yeah)

[Chorus: Rob $tone]
Got heat? (Got heat, aye)
I bagged a pretty bitch right off the street (right off the street)
Yeah, I told her look, not me (not me)
I am not the one to put a ring on it (to put a ring on it)
Yeah, but she gon' let me put the team on it (team on it)
And I don't like a wood without some weed on it (yeah)
All night stack green hunnids (I stack green hunnids)
All up on the map, I put the team on it (yeah, yeah)
Got heat? (Got heat, aye)
I bagged a pretty bitch right off the street (right off the street)
Yeah, I told her look, not me (not me)
I am not the one to put a ring on it (to put a ring on it), yeah
