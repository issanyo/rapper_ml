[Chorus]
Reasons, used to cop the reefer from the weed man
Niggas get to trippin', where your grandma stay? say
Reasons, used to cop the reefer from the weed man
Shit, goddamn, say, I say
Reasons, used to cop the reefer from the weed man
Niggas get to trippin', where your grandma stay? say
Reasons, used to cop the reefer from the weed man
Goddamn
Now I (I), I swear to god (I swear to god)
Lately I been feelin' myself (yeah, yeah)
I been on my job (I been on my job, goddamn, goddamn)
Now I (I), I swear to god (I swear to god)
Lately I been feelin' myself (yeah, yeah)
I been on my job (I been on my job, goddamn, goddamn)

[Verse]
Lately I been feeling myself like New Edition
Lately I been distant from bitches who got me twisted
I can live with a few shots, the Henny nothing different
More champagne, let the bottle pop, got tipsy bitches kissin'
Young Rob on a mission and fixing to handle business
Off my talent I get bitches, I'm quicker to get the film
My Gucci cost 'bout six of your checks, my diamonds trim
Persistent with the fur and the leather, it's such a trip
This year I met two hot mamis back in college
They ain't 'bout it or ever hit me up until they saw me
On the screen, on the TV, with my squad, 'cause we got poppin'
Now they flocking and I'm bothered, these bitches can't get McDonalds
Winners all around me, the energy so astounding
All these millionaires just want me, I always knew I could flaunt it
Remy still be poppin', you're sitting at home and watching
I'm ignorant and I got problems, now listen up while I tell you all the

[Chorus]
Reasons, used to cop the reefer from the weed man
Niggas get to trippin', where your grandma stay? say
Reasons, used to cop the reefer from the weed man
Shit, goddamn, say, I say
Reasons, used to cop the reefer from the weed man
Niggas get to trippin', where your grandma stay? say
Reasons, used to cop the reefer from the weed man
Goddamn
Now I (I), I swear to god (I swear to god)
Lately I been feelin' myself (yeah, yeah)
I been on my job (I been on my job, goddamn, goddamn)
Now I (I), I swear to god (I swear to god)
Lately I been feelin' myself (yeah, yeah)
I been on my job (I been on my job, goddamn, goddamn)
