{Verse 1}

Baby girl don't gas me up
Just give me all your money
I go shop and pop a tag
Look for me but im stunting
Yellow bitch
I [?] get to guap
And then i'm repping
I got plugs in different countries
Rev my engine up like fuck it
Dropping tabs
A couple [?] bitches wanna suck me too
I touchdown in LA
Do my dance
Like look who coming through
My bitch still sitting comfortable
My [?] still give a bitch the blues
Im wilding, wilding, wilding
But my song hit number one real soon

{Chorus}

Stop
Lil nigga you not fucking with me
Got some bitches sitting pretty
They just rolling the weed
They getting high
Just why they get pics when they see
I'm so damn pretty they should play me on T.V
Hell nah
I ain't fucking with y'all
Hell nah
Won't ever have no feelings for y'all
Hell nah
I ain't fucking with y'all
Bitch hell nah
[?] get the benjis with y'all

{Verse 2}

When I woke up
First thing I did was get some money
I tried to get some lean
But damn the plug was acting funny
I'm booming and i'm bucking
[?]
Roll a gram
And crush a one too
This bitch bitches clowns and niggas too
I just stand up like fuck it
Pour me up and double cup it
You frowning little pook
I just wild out and burn the dope
Free my nigga Davis and my daddy cousin too
My niggas coming from the [?]
We got bitches bringing dope

{Chorus}

Stop
Lil nigga you not fucking with me
Got some bitches sitting pretty
They just rolling the weed
They getting high
Just why they get pics when they see
I'm so damn pretty they should play me on T.V
Hell nah
I ain't fucking with y'all
Hell nah
Won't ever have no feelings for y'all
Hell nah
I ain't fucking with y'all
Bitch hell nah
[?] get the benjis with y'all
