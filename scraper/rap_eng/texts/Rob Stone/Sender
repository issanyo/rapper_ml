[Verse 1: Malik Burgers]
Dippin', I'm dabbin', I'm flippin' that bitch
And I send her
Met that stupid ho all up on Tinder
Bitch I don't give a fuck about your Twitter
She talk that shit like I'ma fuckin' miss her
I dropped that ho then bust all on her sister
Fuck yo baby momma, call a sitter
She suckin' 'til I nut, she ain't no quitter
I'm duckin' when she try to take a picture
I'm not the only one that's fuckin' with her
She all up on my dick, she can't forget it
Burgers' in this bitch, she called me mister
And if I need that neck she 'gon deliver

[Chorus: Rob $tone]
I'm dippin', I'm dabbin', I'm flippin' that bitch and I send her
I'm dippin', I'm dabbin', I'm flippin' that bitch and I send her
I'm dippin', I'm dabbin', I'm flippin' that bitch and I send her
I'm dippin', I'm dabbin', I'm flippin' that bitch and I send her
I'm dippin', I'm dabbin', I'm flippin' that bitch and I send her
I'm dippin', I'm dabbin', I'm flippin' that bitch and I send her
I'm dippin', I'm dabbin', I'm flippin' that bitch and I send her
I'm dippin', I'm dabbin', I'm flippin' that bitch and I send her

[Verse 2: Thommed Cruz]
I'm dippin', I'm dabbin', I'm flippin' that bitch
And I send her
I need me a meal, no dinner
I'm schemin', I'm scammin' all up on her sister
Oh, that's yo Mrs.? Well you just missed her
I been had the bitch, she bend on my dick, been a bitch
She callin' me dad, I never had kids, you niggas ain't shit
I'm probably gon' pass, on the pussy, if it ain't shit
Or if it smells like fish, I can't stand the stupid bitch
Thom Cruz, yeah bitch I'm the hottest
Burgers been my nigga since Sonic
Rob been my nigga since robbin'
Broke bitch stop it
I hear loose change in yo pocket
Bitch!

[Chorus: Rob $tone]
