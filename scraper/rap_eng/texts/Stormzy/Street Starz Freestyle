They don't bang they claim they do
Got more grade than an Asian yute
Old school, old to mans been local
Listen to lay dem spray dem crew
I’m never in a ravin' mood
But the sub goes boom like Katie's tune
Couple friends are paigons too
But I still back beef like Raymond do
Or should I say like Raymond does
Calm but I still get a paigon touched
All ten gangsters got no heart
So we call dem man "they’re half way tugs"
Got a semi like my dicks half way up
One par me when the park game sucks
Come from a part of the town where dons move brown and some move class A drugs
But - but let me get back to the point
Too sick never sound whack on a joint
Didn't wanna go back to back with the boy
'Cos these dry MC's are actually moist
Yeah, with a few dons I know do this ting
They thought that shit will change cah Stormzy's back on this music ting
Nah bruh, tap my name on you let these niggas know
And I know it's dumb but I just wanna see how far she'll go
And I know I'm young but they’re gonna see how fast I blow
And I don’t mean run when I say I'll blow
I mean that it’s off to the charts I go
But - but let me get back to the track
Get cash put that straight in the sack
Skinny man but I got weight on my back
Sorta powered up put a chain on the track
Racks on racks, cah all of us get racks get wrapped

Listen, oi, alright listen

But it's easy to push to me
Said the raves hard, shouldn't have shubz to me
Move to the girl, said she was facey
That's weird, she weren’t even stush to me
I stay calm don't even look to beef
I make P, venues be booking me
Wife said it was the best beat of her life like
Nah fam she was just a couple jook to me
Nah, wait can't chat shit to me
Or come on some bad boy tip to me
Cah I spray bare, call me a Mayfair
Half of these MC's come like Chip to me
Big boys nah they kiss to me
Talk shit cousin your history
Mandem always watchin' my face
Oi merks, do I got tits on me
Make up, red lipstick on me
Nah do I look like -
