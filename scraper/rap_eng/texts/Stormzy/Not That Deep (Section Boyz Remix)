[Hook: Stormzy]
Yo
Man wanna talk like they're down for the war
That's not war, that's not beef
That yout' said he was a section boy
But that's not Litz, That's not Sleeks
That's not Swift and that's not Inch and
That's not K9, that's not Reeks
Man said he's been on it from time and I
Looked at him like that's not Deeps

[Verse 1: Deepee]
Boom, man a put Max on beat
Corn on cobs, wraps on cheese
Walked in the shop, Got racks not deets
Hoodie got goggs like that's not Deeps
I'm good with the box, man'a put packs on streets
I'm been giving shots, man'a say thanks just leave
I bully your squad, I don't take crap from neeks
They fully forgot man are not bad, they're breeds
They fully forgot man are not one of them please
Manaman talk, not one of them speak, they're weak
Manaman grind and eat
They're not grime, they hide and fleet
Man no cry, man ride man's greaze
If I pull up outside, man hide, just peak
If a nigga buss high slugs fly high like bees
Fill a nigga upright with fries cause beef

[Verse 2: Swift]
They used to think that I'm weird
Now they think that I'm harder
Plus, my friend got a beard
And he's looking Osama
Somebody get a chair
I can't stand in farmers
What you doing round here
Them man are just barbers
Gyal give me that hmhm
I make her say uh-uh
She done give me the punana
Now tell your friends about banana
Peng, peng, peng
Them man hate much
Don't hate on my brudda
Saw them, they won't say much
What you sayin', they didn't say nada

[Verse 3: Sleeks]
It's not that deep, see me in the street
Bare eight balls 'cause I broke down the key
Hype with me, eight man stuffed in a Jeep
And we're coming down this eve
Touch my weed, acting like you don't know
Nigga this S4P, cutting through Heath
That nigga owes me P's
Chased him till he got weak
Nigga it's peak, man can't phone me again
Delete my number I told him again
Gyal with the big back phoning again
Wanna FaceTime and show me her breasts
I just do my job, get my prof'
Nigga stop watching me
Talking that I got boxed, shut your gob
Nah, that's not Sleeks

[Verse 4: Inch]
What'd you mean it's not that deep
Man talk light. he get boxed in the cheek
Peak, wrote these bars last week
Them man are mooks that can never be we
See, caught him on the road with the Os
Them man move so shook
Never gave a look, likkle man tried to pipe up
Gave him a right hand hook
Talk about mook, nah, I never been a mook
Always been a crook, never been shook
Thank God for the trips I took
I shout codes for the whips we took
Gyal wanna kiss this foot
I've got a little gypsy thot
And she gives head like Pixie does
Then she gone like pixie dust

[Hook: Stormzy]
Man wanna talk like they're down for the war
That's not war, that's not beef
That yout' said he was a section boy
But that's not Litz, That's not Sleeks
That's not Swift and that's not Inch and
That's not K9, that's not Reeks
Man said he's been on it from time and I
Looked at him like that's not Deeps

[Verse 5: Littlez]
See me in the streets, I be doing road with my bros
Flooding up the streets with the Os
Tryna get Ps, man, I know niggas that squeeze
My bruddas keep it sho
Talking 'bout Litz, manna come swift on the beat
Ask Deeps, can't mess with the flow
See her in the rave, got no P's in her purse
Look like she got a dry throat
Stormz made dark skin sexy again
Now my light skin ting wanna text me again
It's not that deep, they can't compare to the depths
Section, we the best in the ends
I heard it's your girl, but she left with my friend
She came on a bus but she left in a Benz
No, I don't care where you're from
Bun your rep, you can still get hit with the skeng

[Verse 6: Reeko]
Man are just talking loads
Bro, we talking code
They say we just rap, I dunno
These times they don't look on road
Wrapped in cling
And my feet like Fred Flinstone
They drinking JD
My niggas smoking dope
Box him in JD
He was looking at bro
Uck with the tongue ring
Got me feeling all grown
Ring, ring, ring, ring
Should've silent ringtone
Hard food like dumping
Feeding cats on my own

[Verse 7: K9]
It's not that deep like Joker, why so serious?
We've been going in for a while, now they wanna hear us
Man these niggas hilarious like a stand-up
I'm only gonna sit down with my bands up
From now I'ma run till my stamina runs out
Cause I'm up in for run up
Little niggas with them guns up
Bare Zs in the house, but I ain't going sleep now
I'm on the streets tryna renown
Then mummy kicked me out
Me and B rolling through your ends, watch me skid round
Get the youngers smoked, still won't put the blades down
I ain't putting this gauge down
Section in the place, everybody on the wave now

[Hook: Stormzy]
Man wanna talk like they're down for the war
That's not war, that's not beef
That yout' said he was a section boy
But that's not Litz, that's not Sleeks
That's not Swift and that's not Inch and
That's not K9, that's not Reeks
Man said he's been on it from time and I
Looked at him like that's not Deeps
Wait
