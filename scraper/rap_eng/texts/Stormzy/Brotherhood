[Intro]
Look, yo

[Hook]
Half of your mandem are locked up
Pissed or bunning buj (bunning buj)
Them cold arse nights on the strip
Never done him good (done him good)
Ride for my team
And I ride like my brothers would (brothers would)
And we don't do friends round here
Round here, it's brotherhood (brotherhood)
We don't do friends round here
Round here, it's brotherhood (brotherhood)
We don't do friends round here
Round here, it's brotherhood (brotherhood)
We don't do friends round here
Round here, it's brotherhood (brotherhood)
We don't do friends round here
Round here, it's brotherhood

[Verse]
Yeah, welcome to hell
Bring your G, man, he's welcome as well
Tell police to release all my team
Do it ASAP before I come bail them myself
So tell me, why do you draw me out (huh?)
I keep on guard when I walk about
Old school beef with some old school youts
But I'm real old school, I'll sort him out
I just done some things that I never intended
Fucked up streets
There's fucked up beef that's never been ended
I won't act like I've never been tempted
To grab my gun and go to war
To grab my gun with no remorse
To catch the yout and blow my torch
And kill the prick and go to court
Who cares what you done back then?
Round here, young Gs don't think twice
Come to your block with the big MAC-10
Yo, fuckboy, should've stayed inside
Man don't care 'bout your name on the roads
Don't come round here thinking you're tough
We don't care what you done in '06
Just know real niggas call your bluff, yo

[Hook]

We don't do friends round here
Round here, it's brotherhood (brotherhood)
We don't do friends round here
Round here, it's brotherhood
