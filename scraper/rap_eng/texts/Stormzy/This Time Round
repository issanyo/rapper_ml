[Hook]
This time round I said that
I'll be different for you baby
This time round I said that
I'll be different for you baby
This time round I said that
I'll be different for you baby
Nuttin' ain't changing, my same old ways
You say that I'm selfish, baby I can't help it

[Verse 1: TE dness]
Yeah, Imma blow up for my people and buy them expensive cars
Buy them grand pianos and buy them some fresh guitars
Them boys sass all your runnings but they don't come mess with ours
'Cause we affiliated fully, my plug the young Escobar
And I know she prefer me off this shit, sitting in offices
But baby I had you from the getty, no broken promises
Guys giving you side-eyes but you ain't on the shit
'Cause you only see one, I, you my apocalypse

Every time you open your mouth, it's like philosophy
Had demons but your aura took over and got 'em off of me
Dem boy there try and hit you on Insta, it don't bother me
I'm breaking down the brick in the kitchen, you whip the pot for me
And I can't tell you how much I appreciate it
Girl, I can't wait for the day I tell you that we made it
I ain't big on speaking 'bout feelings, rather spit 'em for you
Told you this time round, that I'd be different for you

[Pre-hook]
Nuttin' ain't changing, my same old ways

And yeah, I've got a couple meetings
But now a nigga finna cancel those
And maybe I could come and see ya
If you don't want no problems, baby, I don't want 'em either
I paint a picture for you, turn you into Mona Lisa
I write a scripture for you, now I know I've caught a keeper

But check it, look

One time for my old hoes, two times for my ex ting
Three times for my down bitch, four times for my next ting
See, they come and go, so I stay uninvolved
A bit of rum and coke, yeah, that's my summer flow
See, I get mad love from my old bros, mad love from my peopledem
Mad love from the OTF, grab a plate and I eat with them
See, that's normal cah it's love
They leave you in the rain and try and call you when you're up

But I'm not down for that
