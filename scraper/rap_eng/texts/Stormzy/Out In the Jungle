[Verse 1: Squeeks]
Out in the jungle, bunch of gorillas
Keep your eyes on your bitch, she be fucking your niggas
I've got five on my wrist, I don't fuck with beginners
I'll be up in the kitchen, blast Yungen and Jigga's
With a bit of the soda, double up on the magic
I'll be turning it over, soldiers hitting the addicts
Always wanted a Rover, but I came in the Audi
Half my niggas are white, look like them bruddas from TOWIE
You niggas be on the bench, you see I'm a threat
And if I back the match facts, you're pissing the bed
I had a couple black straps, no need to pretend
Back then I could've copped a bimmer or Benz
I'm G5 fly
I've got more connects than your Wi-Fi
Fake niggas wan' hate me when I fly by
But real talk, I don't even live the high life, I just came

[Verse 2: Sneakbo]
See, I'm coming from the streets, coming from the block
I do this for my niggas that are repping for the squad
My brudda Ronnie Dean saying prayers at the mosque
And my niggas OT got the life popping off
I got them niggas on the block that's never had a job
Hood chicks knocking down the hammers for the dons
Max 35s and 9s and big pumps
Young little bucks with hearts they gon' dump
Like bang-ba-ba-bang-ba-bang-ba-bang-bang
Forgot about school, they started rolling with the gang
Tryna earn stripes, tryna be the real man
In Brixton riots they be tryna kill man like
Hold that, you little joke man
I send corn if a nigga try provoke man
You niggas are some pussies, man, you won't bang
Check the scoreboard, nigga, I'm a roadman

[Verse 3: Dubz]
Yeah, it's Double Up Dubz, I double up, cuz
I hit it with a book and when she bubble up, trust
Some other niggas know me as the homie that's
Whipping a bird up with ammonia, and I ain't the only one
The whole team's winning, if they see me rocking a chain
It ain't a stolen one, no, he didn't
Nigga, stop grabbing your balls up like you own a gun
It's all bullshit like Pok√©mon
I've got the 9, 9, you could get a hole in one
Fucking with some niggas that Obi like Kenobi Wan
I'm feeling cozy with a roley on
Get the naughty 40 oughty out, sporty clothing on
I bet you that I sort 'em out when it's going wrong
And that's word to this beat that I'm flowing on
D&G jeans with the sewing on, shower man
They don't know a man

[Verse 4: Stormzy]
Niggas got me paro, I ain't saying where I'm going
Be a man and pay your debt, you better pay 'em what you're owing
Super Saiyan in the flesh, it's kinda crazy how we blowing
Used to look up out my window, I was praying that it's snowing
That was Christmas, had a PS2 up in my wishlist
Opened up my boxes, saw some socks like "mum, what is this?"
Chilling up in sixes, nigga, mind your business
Boy was talking crud so you might end up as a witness
That's some other shit, I ain't bussing guns but yeah, my brothers is
Check one, Stormz just spazzed, live coverage
The fire that I'm coming with, you ain't really keeping up
You ain't really fucking with, come and take a seat with us
Nah, furthermore, stay there, you ain't got a plate here
Niggas is my sons, Imma put 'em into daycare
Tell 'em niggas "stay clear, this ain't what you want
This is real life, you're just spitting on a song", word

[Verse 5: Mr Bigz]
Dining in my home up in the country
With some pikeys that'll tell you it's a pony for a pumpy
Ballsy cause I'm comfy but I'm frowning cuh my people dying
So I'mma grab the track and pound it till the beat is crying
Vermin are stressing, I yearn for aggression
Burn like a Wesson, I'm serving attention, purging this urban depression
Learnt the profession for some box-fitters, block-flippers
Mob figures, talking some top wiggers who drop hitters
All my thugs pimp quick
If a chick wanna bone, tell a dumb bitch sit
Cause I run this shit, train 'em like a track meet
I'm presidential so it's brain up in the back seat
Ugh, Kennedy shit
If a spitter think he's sick, then my remedy's quit
This is therapy, bitch, I put the halt to a clown
Big cash, big back, we're the talk of the town
I'm out
