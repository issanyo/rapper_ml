[Verse 1]
I got ten girls and they all from outta town (woo woo)
I got a light skin, know how to put it down
She text me whenever she come to the city
You know you like that drink, now you wanna get tipsy (ahh yeah)

[Pre-Hook]
I keep her like her, pretty face like her
She don't want no love, she don't want no hugs
She just wants that uh, I'mma own that punt
I'mma own that pussy, I'mma own that pussy, she got a back like Nicki
Small mouth with the head to match, she a brainiac
Jump on this swisher, you can rain on that

[Hook]
She came over so I could put some love on it, love
Turn that pussy over cause I know what you want
You want that daddy dick all night long, put you on
The D's like magic, she say she wanna grab it
Clinging on me like a magnet, I'm like a bad habit
She party like a fast one but she know she gotta have it
Come over
She want that daddy dick all night long, I'mma put you on

[Verse 2]
I got a dark skin girl, she said she wanna hold me down
Ass so thick, damn, I had to buy another round
She wanna be in the band, and I was like U2
Tell me how she got my songs on repeat on her iTunes

[Pre-Hook]
I keep her like her, pretty face like her
She don't want no love, she don't want no hugs
She just wants that uh, I'mma own that punt
I'mma own that pussy, I'mma own that pussy, she got a back like Nicki
Small mouth with the head to match, she a brainiac
Jump on this swisher, you can rain on that

[Hook]
She came over so I could put some love on it, love
Turn that pussy over cause I know what you want
You want a daddy dick all night long, put you on
The D's like magic, she say she wanna grab it
Clinging on me like a magnet, I'm like a bad habit
She party like a fast one but she know she gotta have it
Come over
She want that daddy dick all night long, I'mma put you on

[Interlude]
The D's like magic, she know she gotta have it
Clinging on me like a magnet
I seen you on Instagram looking all pretty, looking like a goddess
I like your bad habit

[Verse 3: Stormzy]
Yo, Yeah
Leave your front door a little bit open
I'll swing round, I'll bring some loud we can puff to we're zoning
It's been a long time but I'm hoping
You still like the taste of my potion
And we can get lost in the moment
Wait right there let me get things rolling, like you get a bit controlling
I'll have your bed sheets soaking
My energy Hulk Hogan
Why did you think I was joking
I can turn your bedroom into an ocean
You like my marijuana that bad habit, my uh and I can't stop smoking (word)

[Hook]
She came over so I could put some love on it, love
Turn that pussy over cause I know what you want
You want a daddy dick all night long, put you on
The D's like magic, she say she wanna grab it
Clinging on me like a magnet, I'm like a bad habit
She party like a fast one but she know she gotta have it
Come over
She want that daddy dick all night long, I'mma put you on
