[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Live from the rhythm, it's
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
That somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here (get that shit up)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Live from the Genesis
Underline it for emphasis
There is no way to pretend that we don't really know what the ending is
Part of me thinking that even addressing is being too generous
Do you really think that they'll notice when you get removed from the premises?
And it makes you so mad
That somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad
That I won't give you the respect that the others do
And you can't understand it was over before it's begun
Hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from
You guys ready to sing that shit?

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(Don't you come back no more)
Fuck
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye (Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye (Don't you come back no more)

[Verse 3: Stormzy]
Yo, ayy
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours, this is our life
Still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoes
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's
Gang

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye (Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye (Don't you come back no more)

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Stormzy]
Stormzy!
Make some fucking noise!
Make some noise for Stormzy ladies and gentlemen!
Oh London, I love you guys, thank you
