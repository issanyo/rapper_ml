[Intro]
Yo, I guarantee you 6ix mixes this in like 10 minutes or some shit
Skeng

[Verse]
Yo, you can't ever tell me that they wrote my raps
They're tryna' run the race, I got 'em overlapped
They're tryna' walk my path, I make the road collapse
Oh, they think I'm cool, they think I won't attack
Just wait until the tape drops
What kind of gangster rapper gets his face boxed?
What kind of gangster rapper goes and name drops?
What kind of gangster rapper gets his chain popped?
I'm starting to feel like the frauds
I pull up to the club and they open my door
Couple pretty girls, it's like pussy galore
Been in the booth for months, I put pussy on pause
Still making moves when I'm sitting indoors
Listening to MoStack, I might bring him on tour
I phone my brudda K, "could you bring me a draw?"
Can I get a round of drinks or a round of applause?
I dropped "Shut Up" just to make 'em shut up
These niggas love to reach, they tryna' find a come up
I ain't never seen you go and fuck a club up
If there's any problems you can come and buck us
Ah, they're getting faker as the hours pass
Got her hand prints all up on the shower glass
Hate me cause I'm humble, see you are just sour rass
Like you're sneaky being cool, you're not allowed to laugh
Crack a smile man, you bruddas sounding insecure
Stormzy kill 'em all, Stormzy kill 'em all
I got brothers in the pen I need to visit more
Fuck your girl for the bants, I'm so immature
Krept told me this would happen
Krept told me they hate me because I'm rapping
Krept told me these niggas go out of fashion
Krept told me, look fuck 'em, we'll catch 'em lacking
These rappers sending threats then they start backing down
I ain't with the drama so what happens now?
Money on the flat, I feel like Jackie Brown
Book me for the venue and I'll pack it out
They say my name and then they backtrack
Touch the mic or bun the mic, I tell 'em jack that
Them man are fake with all the hate, these niggas back stab
Man are waiting, I just tease 'em on my Snapchat
But I soon some, soon drop the fire for 'em
Save the whole damn thing, I'm the messiah for 'em
The bar was so low, Stormz made it higher for 'em
Rappers all on life support, I feel to pull the wire on 'em
It's a sad day
Most your favourite rappers having bad days
Either sniffing coke or in a bad place
Come and take a shot if you're mad brave
Straight, just be careful when you send for Mike
Cos you can start a war and it can end tonight
You're either here to talk or either here to fight
And I ain't with the talking, I can't hear the hype
You niggas make me laugh, you niggas Michael Dapaahs
I'm so fucking sick of all you lying rappers
Call me Mike the king or call me Mike the gaffer
Might kill the fucking game and go to Ayia Napa
You tryna' die a king or tryna' die a trapper?
You tryna' die a king or tryna' die a trapper?
Had to say it twice because it really matters
All these washed up dons always tryna' gas us
I don't rate that
I tell em' take that, I call it payback
These niggas suck dick, they some j-bags
And I don't take chat from no waste yat

[Outro]
Yeah, don't come to my studio on that fake shit
Don't come to my funeral on that fake shit
We don't coke sniff all that nose shit
Yeah I built my spliff then I smoked this
So I was in my zone and I wrote this in 10 minutes
Shut down this whole game in 10 minutes
Shut down your whole Twitter feed in 10 minutes
Sold out my first show in 10 minutes
I watched 6ix go mix this in 10 minutes
