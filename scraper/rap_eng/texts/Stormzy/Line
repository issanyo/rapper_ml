[Intro]
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah

[Verse]
Like, yeah
I'm quite impressed
Need more pounds, I might invest
Look at me now, private jets
Who woulda known I'd be writing cheques
Big Mike, live in the flesh
Life dun changed, my life was a mess
Yeah, my life was a mess
But aight fuck that, it's time to finesse
Ooh, the boy's got fabulous rhymes (Rhymes)
And he's got an Adidas line
100 bags for the show (Show)
Had to make my manager decline
It's like I'm Jamie Carragher on grime (Grime)
Spitting on the riddim 'til it's soaked
Hit 'em then I kill 'em with the smoke
I am not the nigga to provoke
Ah, Stormz still coming for the necks (Necks)
Fuckboy I'm coming for you next
Rock you when I'm running up the steps
Dodge you when I'm ducking from the feds
Like, wait
Are we just gonna pretend
That Stormz ain't the nigga that they always recommend (Recommend)
From a city where we never beg friends
Still a three stab ting til the end
