[Intro: Little Simz]
Do you wanna see a dead body? Probably not
Real dark in a cemetery where the souls lie
Thought that I was finished, I kill it with no eyes
Know that I'm the one, don't be foolish and don't be dumb
I ain't gonna wish you a murder, this shit for fun
Stormz, chat to 'em quick, this ain't what they want, nah

[Verse 1: Stormzy]
20 man deep, me and Simz in the Jeep
Yeah it's peak on the streets when I get squaddy
I do dirt with a smile on my face
Look I ain't never said sorry
Niggas want a problem, I am the problem
Fuck clip, peak when I get donny
Kill an MC then I roll to the scene on a greaze with my G's
And I piss on the dead body
You say "wah wah gwan" little bat shit
Now I'm in a brand new car with an actress
Niggas say I drive too fast, it's a madness
And I'm going way too hard with this rap shit
And I'm going way too hard in the scene
Might just spin an MC 'til he back flips
Fuck with the future, I am the shooter
Jump in my Uber, take me to Gatwick

[Pre-Chorus: Stormzy]
I can't say no more
Had enough of this shit, can't take no more, yeah
And if I ever break, I fall
Simz, just promise me you'll save them all
Yo Simz, kill these fuckin' niggas man, fuck's sake

[Chorus: Little Simz]
I just might sell my soul
Cause I don't feel like I'm a part of the world no more
Will anybody miss me when Iâ€™m gone?
Will anybody miss me?

[Verse 2: Kano]
One body, two body, three body, four
Mind's right, body's right, sippin' a bottle of somethin'
That was my first body
PP Palace Pavilion, SM57 duppy civilians
SM58s and Sennheisers, no survivors, nobody's innocent
Sent for your highness, coming to kill again
I got the fire, better do diligence
Weapon of choice
You can't test the levs, we got twelve .10's
And we might test the prez, we got sets to rep
We don't beg no friend, we might stomp you bad
We got Crep Protect
We just vex for them, we might send for them
Say they're old school but we don't 'member them
We don't recollect, we just cheque collect
Chapter one, verse two, the street testament, nigga
Walk and live, talk and bumbaclart dead
Don't talk to bumbaclart feds
Don't be in the street for bumbaclart cred
Just be in the street for bumbaclart bread
Hard dough, nigga go hard though
Pour some wine out when your soldiers far though
Better mind out for the snakes in smart clothes
Jakes and Marlos, nigga
Five body, six body, seven body more
True body, nobody, they don't want a war
Rain nobody for the boy
Missin', Where's Wally for the boy
Tom Sully on a nigga
Duppy in jewelleries and hoodies
Simz ridin' with me til the end of this movie
No sing alongs, rodents, no comment
Joint enterprise, everybody's gettin' M's
Clip renegades and nobody's gettin' M'd
We're just gettin paper, nobody's gettin' penned
Well, my nigga GH just came up out the pen
And I brought him on tour
And he caught another body for me, nigga
Head top a nigga, rah rah
I'm the Lord of the Mic, if you're the lord of the manor
I can get you Ned Starked
Full clip loaded with bars, I'm a marksman

[Verse 3: Little Simz]
Do you wanna see a dead boy?
Oh no, shit, the last thing I want is for people to be scared of me
Come close, I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna feel...
Paranoia thoughts, everything distorts
Why you ever sure, in the midst of a murder scene, I end up a  corpse
You endorse whatever they feed to you
And of course your support will only deceive people
When it's forced you believe whatever you read's coming from a source
I'm ashamed you didn't know better, in fact I'm appalled
Can you blame the innocent, ever only when they're fooled
I'm rambling, I was challenging, maybe I'm going skitzo again
I'm panicking, scrambling for pennies for your thoughts
I adore no colour other than black, give me more
Don't you ever try and step to me or raise your tone of voice
If you ever get me mad I'll put and end to all your noise
If you wanna be a target I happily will destroy you
Whatever you thought you was and believe me I will enjoy it
They haven't gave me my crown and I'm really getting annoyed
Put him in a coffin, we can get him poppin'
I should go ahead, but I'ma give you a choice
This grown Simba is not fuckin' with little boys, I'm a king
Tell me any different, tell me that I'm kidding
Why they wanna tell me lies? Tell 'em that I'll never listen
You shouldn't have told me to tell you the chosen one has risen
Tell 'em, tell 'em (I'm a fuckin' beast)
Tell 'em I'm a beast, tell 'em I believe in everything I stand for
Tell 'em I'm a G, tell 'em I'ma be here
My soul is never to leave, never will I sell my soul

[Bridge]
(Do you wanna see a dead body?)
Dim the lights, yeah
(Do you wanna see a dead body?)
What the fuck is city life? Yeah
I just might sell my soul
Would you buy it? Yeah
Would you buy it? Yeah

[Verse 4: Little Simz]
I'll bring it to the source
I've been tryna let it be organic, never forced
Steady killin' it and I'll never show remorse
Zonin' to the realest shit and channelling my thoughts
Recording my album in a month while on a tour
Just give me my credit where it's due, don't need applause
Don't bother yourself with giving me a nomination
If you're not gonna be honest when you're dashing out awards
Make your bed and lay in it, you're sleepin' on the floor
They be sleeping on me heavy
"Dead Body" had so many positive subliminals
But you will never see that shit on telly
Guess it's the game though
Maybe I don't wanna be a part of it
And maybe what I make ain't user-friendly
But it's okay to show the shit that's only dumbing niggas down
And give it to the kids like it's impressive
I don't understand it, maybe it's the reason I'm not from this planet
Maybe it's the reason I appeared and everybody vanished
Maybe it's the season, fuckin' up the way you manage
Live an ordinary life, I feel it's hard to keep the balance, pray for me
Once my soul was tainted, ain't no saving me
Takin' hella risks yet they don't commend my bravery
But fuck it, I don't fuckin' need it
Try and steal it from the rich and give it to the needy
Always sharing what I have, Simz is never greedy
Might just dip and go to Africa, you'll never see me
Don't take me for granted while I'm here now
I must be the one they all fear now, fear now

[Bridge]
Dim the lights, yeah
(Do you wanna see a dead body?)
What the fuck is city life? Yeah
I just might sell my soul
(Do you wanna see a dead body?)
Would you buy it? Yeah
(Do you wanna see a dead body?)
