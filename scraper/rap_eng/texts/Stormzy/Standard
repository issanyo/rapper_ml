I kill an MC (standard)
Leave a boy's face in the Evening (Standard)
You are not a top MC, you're just (standard)
Peng tings in the VIP, that's (standard)
Tell man (standard), Stormz ain't (standard)
Man's got MOBO Awards, that's (standard)
Soon have plaques on my wall like (standard)
Slides and socks on my feet that's (standard)

[Verse 1]
They don't wanna go back to back, I'm the best here
All I gotta do is rap and they get scared
Best Grime Act 2015
Rudeboy, come and chat to me next year
I ain't new to the hype
Have you ever seen what I do to the mic?
Rap like a street boy, sing like a sweet boy
Yeah little nigga, I do what I like
Look, I am the problem, #PROBLEM
If you want a problem, 079 me
You are not Skepta, you are not Wiley
Manna got bars, let a brudda come try me
What? What, you thought I weren't grimy?
What? Didn't know I get lively?
Brain of a wise man, heart like a pikey
Why don't none of these MCs like me? I hear them talk
"How did he win the award, man?
He don't deserve that shit." I tell man straight
"I ain't here to play games
Lord knows that I've earned this shit"
Ayo Flipz, have you heard this shit?
Should I set pace? Should I murk 'em quick?
Come with twenty man, went top twenty fam
Bump "Skeng 4" in my German whip
Look, I ain't saying that makes me great
I'm just saying I'm playing my part
I just find it funny how they
Told me this one ain't gonna chart
Tell all the haters kiss my arse
Year's been mad like where do I start?
Man wanna talk about views on the Fire in the Booth
Go and check my fire in the park
Man want a war, let me know when
Do it in a fist fight, do it with the pen
Tell em that you can go Texas Chainsaw Massacre
I'ma go WickedSkengMan part 10
And he'll go and do a fire in the park part 2
Yeah, you got a car, I got a fast car too
Yeah, you got a gun, I got a rata too
Big man like me getting parred by you?
No way

[Verse 2]
I tell man (standard), them boy (standard)
Fourteen, I was in the hood with the gangsters
Can't be a dickhead in my hood, you'll get banded
Three stripes on my whole team, I stay branded
Get man angered, cool, that's (standard)
Man are like "Brah, are you dead? You get Sanka'd"
Take a man's girl to the spa and get pampered
That's a five star ting, that ain't (standard)
Rudeboy (standard), my shows ain't (standard)
You can get a bottle in your head, you'll get Fanta'd
Out in the town with the lads, I get wankered
I roll with the Gs, but today I'm with the skankers
I pop one Champers, I know bankers
And I know gunmen, thugs and shankers
You can be a target and you can get Manga'd
Cuh I roll deep like my brakes been tampered
Look, any riddim' I touch, I get busy
Ex-girl hitting me up, like "oh really?"
Let me know who's silly enough to get silly
You ain't got a million bucks, you're not Diddy
You ain't got a million bucks, so just cool
Man stay grizzy as fuck like One Fiddy
Blud don't charge me up, I go back to back
You ain't killing my buzz, you're not Drizzy
Wanna get aggy with us? Then go through
Niggas ain't badding me up, I'm not you
No, I weren't catching a bus to roll through
Cause my jeans weren't baggy enough to hold food
Big bit poking out of my waist
Can't be hanging with us, there's no room
All those threats go over my head
Cause you're just not savage enough, you're no goon
