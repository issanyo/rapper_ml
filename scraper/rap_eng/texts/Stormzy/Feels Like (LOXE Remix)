[Intro: NAO]
If you touch
Then you touch
Touch
Touch
Don't you touch
You know you touch
Touch
Touch

[Verse 1: NAO]
Imagining you touch my
Traces in the bed
Run your fingers through the cotton sheets
Smelt the oil from my hair

[Chorus: NAO]
When I drip my perfume on your pillowcase
And then you'll know I was really there

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
Perfume on my clothes
Aftershave on your skin
Some days, we don't smoke
But other days, we go in
Still tryna find that thing
I can't lie, man, you're way too rare
Take a chance, man, you're way too scared
Plus things ain't looking too clear
My forbidden fruit, my hidden truth
You wanna know love? I'm the living proof
That a man might drink if you give him juice
And I'm here if you wanna take a different route
But it feels like, it feels like
It feels like you
And we've made our own little world
But I'll love you up in real life too

[Break: NAO & Stormzy]
And then you'll know
But I'll love you up in real life too
And then you'll know
But I'll love you up in real life too
And we've made our own little world
But I'll love you up in real life too

[Verse 3: NAO]
Imagining you touch my (touch, touch, touch)
Traces in the bed (touch, touch, touch)
Run your fingers through the cotton sheets (touch, touch, touch)
Smelt the oil from my hair (touch, touch, touch)

[Verse 4: Stormzy]
Aftershave on your pillow
Perfume on my sheets
That's when I know you was there
I watch you as you go sleep
Still rolling round in these streets
But I can't find nuttin' like you
Tryna find something like you
Heart piece cutting right through
And it feels like all that it should
I still do all that I could
Never seen a bad girl turn good
And that's coming from a boy in the hood
But it feels like, it feels like
It feels like you
And we've made our own little world
But I'll love you up in real life too

[Break: NAO]
And then you'll know
And then you'll know

[Outro: Stormzy & NAO]
But I'll love you up in real life too
But I'll love you up in real life too
But I'll love you up in real life too
And we've made our own little world
But I'll love you up in real life too
But I'll love you up in real life too
But I'll love you up in real life too
But I'll love you up in real life too
And we've made our own little world
But I'll love you up in real life too, word
Touch
Touch
