[Verse 1: Snap Capone]
Niggas want me dead, that's Chinese whispers, nigga
Click it, wig a nigga, leave no witness, nigga
I'm strapped with that MAC or the AR, nigga
Or the AK, AKA the super sprayer
Snap Capone, the shooter, nigga, grab the Luger
Po from Cuba, gun consumer
Home visit, bun intruder
I don't like these niggas
45 or I'mma 9 these niggas
When I like these niggas
Two TECs, that's Siamese niggas

[Verse 2: Corleone]
Just another gangster nigga
Giving orders, I sanction killers
Fuck with me, I'll have your dinner
I'm a baller, lavish liver
Magnum spinner in my blacked-out bimmer
Crazy as fuck like a cracked-out nigga
I scratch out squealer from the trap house filler
Halo Fox, go and #winner
I don't think I need to rap
I don't think I need to trap
I don't think you've seen the stat
I don't think you mean your raps
As a young buck coming up
Had a gun crush, I'm in love
Big darg, that's puppy love
Oh lord, if my blood start bubble up

[Verse 3: C Biz]
Yeah, this one is a hit
Fuck it, I'm dropping my name on it
They wanting my dreams
Fuck it, I'm dropping the game on 'em
Dropping the pain on 'em
Strippers, I'm making it rain on 'em
Take it back to the trapping
The brandy and work and I'm dropping the 'caine on 'em
Whipping the cane on 'em
Fuck it, I'm flipping the game on 'em
If they talking 'bout money but showing their stacks
I just flip out a chain on 'em
Live by the street code
Exercise my heat with strategy
Gangsters with dreams
I live this shit in reality

[Verse 4: Kyze]
A long time, a lot of man been see-through
That's why there's a lot of man I don't speak to
I'm a man that you leave cause I'll leave you
I'm chasing my dreams, you don't want me to creep through
If I could spit about things that I've been through
I'd scare man away from the mic when I don't mean to
I could speak on things I don't need to
My life is a movie, you'll cry at the preview
Cause I just wanna get the bottles and the rounds in
Fly through the shubs and fly off with a browning
But still, you might see a man frowning
Walking with Giggs like no one come round him
Man's wishes never came from a well or a fountain
It's from a mountain bike, a scale and two ounces
And lately, my inner spirit's been prowling
Ghetts said "cool, let me bring you to the mountain"

[Verse 5: Youngs Teflon]
I was stuck on my face
Couldn't cope no more
Couldn't buy shit I needed
Wasn't no hope no more
I had [?] on the phone
I said "I ain't going broke no more"
Now even though this rap shit's working
I'd be lying if I said I ain't selling dope no more
See, man are doing hoes, man are doing shows
Man are getting ammi in by the load
Still jumping on the beat like a toad
Man, I'm on the radio, still up on the road
I still bring my sword to a battle
And ride with the monkeys on the saddle
What you know about cabbage? That's mense
Can't see me loading it behind the tints

[Verse 6: Stana]
After all the work that I put in
And these niggas I stuck it on
All these that I robbed, all these niggas that I knocked
And these so-called killers that I buss it on
Niggas still looking at me like there's something wrong
Everywhere I go, I bring the gun along, I don't give a fuck about the babylon
Niggas better know where I'm coming from
East side of that London, home of the gunman
Where we gangbang
And bang hammers on folks
We headbutt, uppercut
And we strangle their throats
And it's all for the drugs, jewels and pound notes
Live by the thug rules and stand bold
Niggas better tuck your jewels cause Stan's home
Told niggas that it's fucked for you and alie on road

[Verse 7: Avelino]
Yeah, me too
Spray, I've got a dream too
Out here on D-Block, I'm Sheek Louch
I've got styles and Ps too
Pull up on my enemy
Remember me?
I've got fuel for your jealousy
We're just tryna get fed, they get policed
What a shame
We did it major, it was all in the flats
Keys all in the bag
They think they know me cause they're calling me Av
I'm that motherfucker, you should call me a dad
I wanna put that back in reverse, tell her call me a cab
Fuse got a sword in the bag
But when the MAC rings, ain't no calling him back, snap

[Verse 8: Dubz]
Oi, get it in, oi, get it in
My trap line is peppering
My soldiers dem peddling
Selling the white and heroine
My junkies need medicine
Fuck the boys in blue, not Everton
Men buss case, no evidence
Step out the court with elegance
Whipping up the white semilina
Looking at the pot, it's a beamer
Looking at my Glock, it's a nina
You went and got a shot come between ya
Your girlfriend, she loves you and leaves ya
Comes to my yard for Ciroc and amnesia
Cucking her knees up
Once she gives uck, I just drop her to Peter

[Verse 9: Stormzy]
Look, I'm the youngest in charge
The boy's got cheek but the youngers got bars
The boy ain't peak but he's coming so hard
Go and call your fucking youngers, man, your youngers ain't hard
Man, I'll slap 'em, tell dem boy dere 'llow the rapping
Tell dem boy dere I ain't even down for no collabing
Holla at me later
And by that, I mean please don't holla at the saviour
I gave you niggas a lifeline to live
I gave you niggas the limelight to spit
And all you did was flop, fuck that, man
All you niggas washed like all you niggas lost
Yeah, squaddy, go the the booth, catch a body
Niggas talk shit but my niggas ain't worried
We done it first and them niggas just copy
Tell 'em that I'm sorry, I'm sorry, word

[Verse 10: J Avalanche]
Avalanche, nigga, man, you know me
Five bills spent on my Stoney
Twenty grand spent on my Roley
In the kitchen whipping up the yola
Came out of the kitchen smelling of the crack odour
Profit is enormous, my pockets are bulging
Touch my chain and them straps are loaded
Your bitch said she love my flow, it's the coldest
Shitting on them niggas, man, I need to toilet
To live my life while you're living in a dream
Boy, AR15 from selling 16s
Taking them trips to OT
I was only fifteen
Taking them trips, I was only fifteen
Taking them trips, I was only fifteen

[Verse 11: Big 6ix]
Secure networks when I'm calling the plug
50 wraps when I'm ordering bud
Niggas wan' talk like they've pushed
They ain't talking to us
Put around 10 into 4, then I'm sealing 'em up
I've got 'em all in the cut
I did it all in a month
I nip it all in the bud
I'll piss on all of you cunts
I'll piss on all of your chumps, you dumb fucks
Mummy never raised no bum
I've been raised, little nigga, I ain't dumb
I'll rest your brain on the pump, put your brain in the dump
Say my name when it's done

[Verse 12: Beanz]
Yeah, face is bait with the jakes
I'm Shadow Gang till the death of me
A black bally on the face
That's a murder case for my enemies
Bouquet of black roses
Leave 'em scattered right by the cemetery
My facial expression is frozen
No emotion, slide up and press the piece
They can rest in peace
Or burn in hell, I can't feel a thing
Spray like an AR15
Hit your sweet spot like caramel
I've been to jail and back
So I know about time in the cell
My ninja gang stay strapped
Trapping birdies but they don't never tell

[Hook: Young Spray]

[Verse 13: Young Tribez]
Everybody dreaming
My side, everything's real
I've got the cats dem deeming
Like "what is the deal?"
I tell them two for fifteen
Meet me on the precinct and watch for Old Bill
I started at fifteen
And I skipped the weed ting cause I wanted a mill
Word for the eighteen Zs that were sold
18K for the gold
I put it on the road
Soon as it dropped out the bowl
Your bitch want the dick but I put her on the strip
Nuttin' like the strippers on a pole
In the kitchen when we whip
So it's Benz when we whip on the road, yeah

[Verse 14: Skeng]
Skeng, I'm a nightmare
Balmain logos, no Nike Airs (flashy)
Bad bitch, I've got no type
You're talking buj and Ricki Lake, I've got both types (peng)
Baff put me on the fifteen
Now I'm model whipping on the big screen
In the jungle where it's concrete
And gangsters really live dreams
