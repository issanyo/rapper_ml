[Intro]
Check 1
Yo, easy

[Verse]
Look, I put my city on my shoulders
You ain't cold, I'm cold, I'm the coldest
Got my Adidas creps with my Nigo top
You can't get this yet, man are jokers
Yeah look, I made a tune with Nick Jonas
They said I sold out, that's bogus
I do a Fire in the Park, 3 million views
Now it's album time on the focus
Look man, I'm the one they all fear
I was the man of the year last year
Now I'm the man of the year for the second year straight
Like nobody don't compare
And now I'm sitting on the top and I'm looking straight down
Like "Hold on is anybody there?"
Shut down Malia, shut down Iceland
Oh my god this shit's not fair
Look man, I was on the roads when Dizzee made Stop Dat
You're not a badboy, stop that
Pengtings on my WhatsApp
Yeah they love when I drop that
Niggas still ask where'd I cop that
Jump in a new shaped Coupe then I dropped that
Face is bait so I drop back
Watched MCs wanna beg for their spot back

[Bridge]
But brudda I'm calm
Play with fire and get harmed
Yeah everything's cool 'til I jump out the ride
Like yo pussyhole, wah gwan
If it's arms house then I'm on arms
My bro' Ken's my prop for the garms
And the yardman call me Stormz
You know that I've still got still got that Flava like Kwamz

[Hook]
Kill 'em with the Skengman sound
Skengman flow, skeng man down
Kill 'em with the Skengman sound
Skengman flow, skeng man down
Kill 'em with the Skengman sound
Skengman flow, skeng man down
Kill 'em with the Skengman sound
Skengman flow, skeng man down
Kill 'em with the Skengman sound
Skengman flow, skeng man down
Kill 'em with the Skengman sound
Skengman flow, skeng man down
Kill 'em with the Skengman sound
Skengman flow, skeng man down
Kill 'em with the Skengman sound
Skengman flow, skeng man down
