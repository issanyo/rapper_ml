[Verse 1: Avelino]
Yo, yo, 'llow that yout'
He's a hater, I don't want no bad energy
Man get views but I Ray Charles
'Cause I can't see my enemies
I like all types of girls
Melanins and Melanies
She wants a man from London
She wants a fella with felonies
That's probably all my team
There's no I in it, I'm bringing all my team
Gassed when they saw my team
Even the bouncers bounced when they saw my team
Who d'ya wanna holla? Who d'ya wanna never know?
Don't be a sheep when you can be the GOAT
Greatest of all time? Man, you never know
Don't show up to my show if you've got no (Energy)

[Hook: Avelino]
Energy, energy
Energy, energy

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
Alright, okay, 'llow that yout', he's a fuckboy
I don't want no bad energy
I shell-shell-shell on the mic
Now these little boys wanna put a shell in me
Pure blood in my bloodline
You are not part of my pedigree
These niggas heard a nigga's getting bread
Now they see me on the street and start breading me
Hurt but I heal my wounds, real life goons
These niggas steal my tunes
So much dough just lying in my crib
I find too much money when I clean my room
Tenner on the side, pinky in my top drawer
Rich in my faith, I could never be poor
Why bang a hammer when you can be Thor
Don't pull up to my tour if you've got no (Energy)

[Hook: Avelino]
Energy, energy
Energy, energy
No bad energy, no bad energy
No bad energy, energy

[Verse 3: Skepta]
Mmm, step in the party, me, Fris and Jahlani
Got a pocket full of weed and cash
Bouncers wanna power-trip at the front
So my niggas have to creep through the back
Storm' put the heat on the track
Worldwide, yeah, we put the streets on the map
We're the kings, haffi salute the kings
'Oi king, what d'ya mean? Who's that?'
We should have never gone away
That's Av' the top boy, the top man days
Got fans from St. Anne's to Holloway
Another black millionaire on the way
No gas, every day's a holiday
Don't chat, already know what you're gonna say
It's hot, yeah, hot like a summer's day
So don't show up to my show if you've got no (Energy)

[Hook: Avelino]
Energy, energy
Energy, energy
No bad energy, no bad energy
No bad energy, energy

[Outro]
Energy
