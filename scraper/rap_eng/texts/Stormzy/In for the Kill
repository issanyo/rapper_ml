[Verse 1: La Roux]
We can fight our desires, ooh
But when we start making fires
We get ever so hot, ooh
Whether we like it or not
They say we can love who we trust, ooh
But what is love without lust
Two hearts with accurate devotion, ooh
What are feelings without emotions?

[Chorus: La Roux]
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
Jack played me the beat, I was gassed
Then he asked, "what you gonna do when you rap to the tune?"
I said, "hold on, let me just spazz"
I'ma a go mad, turn the whole thing up in my speaker
Let me tear the whole thing down, fuck a feature
Jumping around in my house and the club
Then he said, "Cuz, you've gotta calm down, take a breather
Peng tings on the WhatsApp, peng tings on my BB too
Fuckboys wanna see me lose, shine bright like RiRi's tune
Still got an item in a rucksack, but now I've got CDs too
Ay, look fuckboy, be you
If you say you've done that, then I must've, me too
Yeah, I'll Wretch man, it's a 32
Still got love for my CDs too
Wanna beef Merms? Gotta beef me too
Wanna squeeze that Jack? Then I'm squeezing too
Wanna speak and chat, but you're beefing who?
Beefing me? Niggas couldn't beef my crew
They can't make a one decent tune
Leave it, tell your boys leave it too
I'm going in deep, going in real like
Check 1-2, check 2 one time
Got a few dons who love gun crime
Got a few dons who run cunchine
Go hard for my dons who ain't done time
All of my dons hate that I'm unsigned
Told em that it's soon my time
Check 1-2, check 2 one time

[Bridge: Stormzy]
I make these rappers wanna retire
Ooh, cause I just spit that nice fire
I make these rappers wanna retire
Ooh, cause I just spit that nice fire

[Chorus: La Roux]
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
