[Intro]
[Stormzy]
I whip up a 16 bar for them
Niggas my sons i father them
The amount of peng tings I've beat this week
Ey yo look peeps wah gwarn for them
Make me have to jump in my car for them
Addition the ones when I'm passing them
I know some killers from Leeds
That wear ripped jeans snapbacks and cardigans
So don't judge a book by it's cover
Cuh you might be pissed when you open it
I went dope for like half of 2013
And I told these niggas make the most of it
Krept and Konan buss of the ends
Now it's my time I take ownership
You niggas don't shot
Oh my god how do you make prof(it) when you smoking it
The light skin girls used to blank me
Use to say that I'm blick and lanky
How can she?
I used to wile out and get angry
You know the same girls that aboy me
Now i call em to my car like OI G!
What's your number? Give it to me quick don't annoy me
You know like that
OTF yeah you know my badge
Nigga I'm old school from a long time I've been local
Go nigga check my stats
Wait, tell a nigga go compare
No, tell a nigga don't compare
Man from the other side
See i can't come to the other side
But i still go round there
Didn't care then and I still don't care
I make peng tings call Mike dear
I make gyal fall out with their husbands
Tell your boyfriend that I'm still not scared
About stop texting your girl?
I text your girlfriend if i like
I late night creep with your babes
Bare ?  flexing the rhyme

Stiff chocolato i still take mans girl I'm an asshole
And I've been cold from way backÂ¨
I need an lem? sip and a carpool
And tell a fuckboy yo take that
I'm the black Gary Barlow

Peng tings on my whats app yeah you know the rest
And she hates every single song on my tape
But she loves ? yeah you know the rest
She said Michael can you grab me
I'm in 12th still on a back street
I said shit man you should have brought cab p
What the fuck do I look like a taxi
Slut! try take Mike for a mug
Try take Mike for a boy in a rave
Then little Mike might just light up the club
Standard, excuse my grammar
The bouncers hench but Big Wormz wammer
Everybody calm down cuh my young G crept in with a blammer
So cool yeah, just cool nah I'm in the corner
Yeah the brown tings mine
Come to the back big girl just wind
Them boy there not about that life
I had to pull my man to the side
I said yo don't kill my wibe
My bredrin there's got a knife
And when he gets drunk he gets all hyped, so just cool off...
