[Hook: Wretch 32]
Woke up on my crucifix again
Was up all night praying for revenge
I don't need more enemies for friends
Tell me, how much times can I kill this game for them?
But I still love these youts, 21 gun salute
Fuck wi' you, 21 gun salute
I put my trust in you, 21 gun salute
Would you share your last bullet with me
If there weren't any more gun salutes?

[Verse: Stormzy]
Yeah, okay, our father who art in Heaven
Lord, I pray that I still stay repping
Pray for my bros and the Pagan souls
Who turn their nose every time I step in
Lord, I pray that my bro stops betting
Man, that roulette machine won't let him
And I can't wait 'til I say, "I do"
And the bros say, "Brap", gun shots at my wedding
You know how we do, flex on occasions, no more food
Left it with Satan, Lord, you know I'm a different person
But, Lord, why do they test my patience?
Please can I bun my zoot in peace?
21 gun salute for these neeks
I don't ever wanna be like them
So I say this prayer every time I go sleep and it goes like this

[Hook: Wretch 32]
Woke up on my crucifix again
Was up all night praying for revenge
I don't need more enemies for friends
Tell me, how much times can I kill this game for them?
But I still love these youts, 21 gun salute
Fuck wi' you, 21 gun salute
I put my trust in you, 21 gun salute
Would you share your last bullet with me
If there weren't any more gun salutes?
