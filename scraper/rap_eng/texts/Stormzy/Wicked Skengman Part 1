Man'll rush man
Route old school like a mustang

Funny how now them girl link us man

Snakes in the grass can't trust man
Dem man started rolling with me now look at em now you can't say I didn't buss man
I buss man I used to argue with the busman
Then watched olders try cuss man
Like I dare anyone of you touch man
Like word that can never be us man
Like word they can never scream fuck man
I chase man down yeah I dup man
You love your girl but she loves man
Look, I grew you niggas
Tweaked and fixed, fine-tuned you niggas
From me man are born and drawn yeah
Myself Stormz I slew this niggas
They say I'm a Youtube nigga
That's cool, I'm fine with that
But when you see me in the flesh could you give me a shout, pull me up and remind me that?
Could you please just repeat that again for me?
Don't let me forget my place
Choo say I'm a Youtube nigga so
You can't just forget my face
Look, man be easy with all dat
Choo say dem guy are breezy and all that
Man wouldn't wanna see me in all black
Cah these niggas see me then fall back
Oi, DJ wheel em up
The brown skin girls wanna feel it up
Yes, nowadays I'm blessed but man disrespect, mum's life I'll beat em up
'mount of peng tings dat I freed up
'mount of peng tings dat I freed up
My enemies can't get me
I told my pagans try teaming up
Try to work as a team
Dem boy they're not murdering me
Heard the other day I got russled and robbed
Never ever listen to the word on the street
Still nice with the strap shit
Still calm up in that strip man I just love when a pack slips
They see me drive past in my black whip
Haters are like 'look at that black prick'
Ah, who's really been ah'd?
No wait who's really in charge?
Man these niggas so fake I'd rather roll with ninny and shan
Same black boy with a million bars but I'd rather kill em with eight
Calm down please don't step out of line
Cah most of my niggas ain't chained
So you still get caught for that bad talk
Still get caught in a gang war
He's shottin on the sly cause it ain't gonna slide cause most of these cats talk
What are man for
I get the ting done like a crash course
Suttin that I done man's laughter
Look, I'm such a pagan I fuck man's girl then I spud man after
Like, yo my brudda, long time my brudda....
