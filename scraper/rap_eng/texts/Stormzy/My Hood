[Verse 1: Ray BLK]
Socks and sliders everywhere and every day
Full English breakfast at a caff, not a caf√©
No, no, baby, we don't let strangers come our way
But you should come to my hood, my hood, my hood
Meet me at Morley's, best fried chicken is in South
I'll show you gangsters, don't you go running your mouth
Mopeds are racing, 2AM outside my house, oh yeah, it's loud
But come to my hood, my hood, my hood

[Link: Ray BLK]
Oh, you should come to my hood, my hood, my hood, my hood
You should come to my hood, my hood, my hood
Yeah, you should come to my hood, my hood, my hood, my hood
You should come to my hood, my hood, my hood

[Verse 2: Ray BLK]
Barely anyone at school after 15
We're chasing paper then Blue Borough should be green
I won't lie, finding a way out is our dream
But you should come to my hood, my hood, my hood
Top floor of Pepys estate, we'll show you our world
That building turns you to a woman from a girl
Now time to stop, life flashes past you in a whirl
But you should come to my hood, my hood, my hood

[Chorus: Ray BLK]
On these streets, these streets
In the dark, we glow
On these streets, these streets
We're high when it's low
On these streets, these streets
Through concrete, flowers grow
In my hood, my hood, my hood, my hood
You should come to my hood, my hood, my hood

[Verse 3: Stormzy]
I'm from a hood where niggas make their money, then they move
The woman in the Caribbean shop is always rude
Tryna get a patty just to complement my food
So why you gotta tell my friends to move?
No, we gotta balls the food when we see the feds spin it
Bare "wah gwan"s, I ain't seen you for a minute
Coming from the land of wings and chicken filets
Where you're from, man won't be able to read but he can bill it
You can see why that's a problem, any given problem
Staring in my face? I'mma ask you "what's the problem?"
You can be Bane or you can be Robin
But we've had a lot of Dark Knights living up in Gotham
Man, there's babies having babies, man, it's crazy up in my hood
Shit's got me praying that I die good
Where we'd rather buy guns before we buy books
Where they left us in the dark, so we light kush, my hood

[Bridge: Ray BLK]
There's no place like home, no place like home
Buy me any ticket, I don't wanna go
To a town where there's no one like me round
Don't take me there or anywhere

[Chorus: Ray BLK]
On these streets, these streets
In the dark, we glow
On these streets, these streets
We're high when it's low
On these streets, these streets
Through concrete, flowers grow
In my hood, my hood, my hood, my hood
You should come to my hood, my hood, my hood
