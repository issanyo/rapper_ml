Eyes on you
You’re everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly

I can’t get over you
You’ve left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly

‘Cause you’re a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
‘Cause you’re a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Check it, yo
You tell me bout your dreams, and tell you about my demons from the past
You said you would never let me leave, that you see that this is deeper than my scars
Every time I try and get away and breathe, girl you scream and I feel it in my heart
You’re the only one I ever let inside, help you rise when I’m reaching for the stars
Look, you always let me sleep up on your yard, just to stop my up from sleeping on my cot
Times when I was beefing up in the Margery, hit me up, like come and meet me in the park
Look, you shine bright like a diamond, I beg you come and lead me through the dark
And if you’re ever down on your luck, call me up, all you need to do is ask, all you need to do is ask
And I’ve got you
And I know it isn’t easy but you need me, man you’ve just got to believe, man you’ve got to
Yeah, I see the pressure in your eyes
I watched the sun setting in the sky, Thank God because you’re a blessing in the skies
Look, I just hope you never die
I just hope I see you fly

But
I can’t sing but I wrote you a song yeah, wrote you a song yeah
Wrong notes but the melody is so clear, the melody is so clear
When I’m lost, I’m so close to gold cause I found my treasure in you
And that’s priceless spending, so let me count my (blessings)

But I know we messed up but let a real brudder make it rare, let a real brudder make it rare
You deserve that much, let me put something in your life, let me put something in your life, put something in your life
You’re telling me there’s only been a couple other people that you’ve been with, imma trust you, imma give you the benefit of the doubt
And Imma love, you can even call me daddy, give you someone to (look up to)

But
Don’t go, don’t leave, please stay, with me
‘Cause you are the only thing I need, to get by, to get by

But, yo
My lady, could you be my, sweet love for my life time
Just be there, when you need me
Just hold on, receive me

Yo
I didn’t know it, it’s just to live, this here my lifestyle
Yo
Speak from the bottom to the top, my lifestyle
Yeah
Living life like I’m beginning with it’s just beginning
I’m on the mountains, popping on clouds and you’re still waiting

Oh won’t you stay with me, ‘cause you’re all I need
And this ain’t love, it’s clear to see, but darling stay with me

Oh won’t you stay with me, ‘cause you’re all I need
And this ain’t love, it’s clear to see, but darling stay with me
