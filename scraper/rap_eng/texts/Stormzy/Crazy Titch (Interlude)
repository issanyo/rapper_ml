[Interlude: Crazy Titch & Stormzy]
Yo
Yo, gang
Yes, my brother
You still don't sound sure
Na, na I'm in the booth right now, right now
I'm in here right now
Alright, let's start then
Alright, look, let's just get one thing clear, I don't fuck about
I am the certi one
I am the one that they call 'Gangster of Grime'
I don't like it but I don't mind it
But I need everyone to know and I'm not just talking about the hood, I'm not just talking about the basics
I'm talking about the whole island of this country, needs to understand what is about to happen
If you put all bias aside, Stormzy has to be Neo, he has to be
So therefore that makes me Morpheus so I'm telling the council right now
This kid, no joke, real, you can hate him all you want
This kid has to be seeing the game in zeros and ones
Like, it's not normal, it's, it's not normal
So #MERKY, #PROBLEM, #WICKEDSKENGMAN
My bro
Na, I like that one, no I like that oneand I don't even know what a hashtag is, I just know it's proper merky
You know a hashtag's a bit more advanced than me
But what people do need to understand is, you see anyone from my era of grime need to recognise
That if you cannot fathom that this guy's about to take it from a second rate genre to a first rate genre
Then you need to look at yourself and be ashamed
Seriously, you have to be ashamed
Because we started from the roots of this ting
Word
Now we've gone past the roots, it's a whole digital age, we don't need the middle man
Mr. Smith is nearly obsolete, we don't need those label ones again
Word, word
We can actually just shot it ourselves and cut through
So everyone needs to understand that when I'm telling you, and I'm certi', my name's Crazy Titch, I'm definitely one million percent certified
I know certi' guys from all over
Brum, Manchester, Notts, Sheffield, Leeds, Manny, Liverpool
These people all say the same thing, "We don't really even know what grime is but we know who Stormzy is"
You know like, so, I don't wanna hear man say "I'm too gangster listening to Stormzy"
Shut up, that's a lie, you ain't
You know them ones right there
Hahaha, word
Nah real talk, It just means you're a hater, na real talk, it just means you're a hater
You know what, that's what it is, this is my opinion and it is my opinion, I don't care what no one says
Real talk, those old guys that don't wanna bring him in
Whatever man, fuck yourself man, you know like, real talk
My brother
Get a Coke and a smile man, seriously, don't play them man there no mind brudda
All them other side crap guys better just shut their mouth, you get what I'm trying to say?
Yeah man, there you go
Fucking Crazy Titch, my brother
Oi, listen, hahaha, oi! What!?
