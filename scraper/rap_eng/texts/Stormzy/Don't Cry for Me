[Verse 1: Stormzy]
See, I love my hood, but the hood shit bugs me
Cuh' man ah put the chrome to my mum
Then they see me and spud me
And plus I got childhood friends that are schemin' to rush me
So if I just pack my bags and I leave this fuckery
Look, nobody judge me
Now I'm just picturing charms all dressed in white
On the steps with Christ
Tryna tell my young Gs to relax and invest in life
They invest in knives
Man, I was in my history class when my bredren died
So vexed that I cried
But I come from a place where the mandem can't let shit slide
So we rest in pride
And it kills us slow, but, bro, I don't need all that
'Cuh the place where I live is the place I will die
But I already preed all that
Can't chat about pain, just look at my veins
Look brudda, I bleed all that
Damn, I just want all my people back, yo

[Chorus: Raleigh Ritchie]
In case you think I've changed and I'm different
I'm not keeping you at a distance
So have a thought for me, yeah
Hold down this floor for me, yeah
Remember the time before things changed? Back in the day
Everything can stay the same
Remember I came? Remember my name?
Remember my face? I don't wanna fade away

[Post-Chorus: Raleigh Ritchie]
Don't cry for me, don't cry for me, oh no, no, no
Don't cry for me, don't cry for me
Don't cry for me

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
Yo, heart on my sleeve, let me open up
TBTs on the block all posted up
Me and them boy don't mix but I'll post it up
And it ain't no family pic but it's close enough
And look man, I still reminisce when I'm holdin' up
I think about the past sometimes and I sober up
'Cause if that boy looks back, it'll hold him up
Man are out here beefin' like we ain't broke enough
Swear these bruddas ain't woken up
Like what have I done to deserve this life?
I got brothers in the pen that I'll never see again
Got my brothers dem servin' life
And I know that you think that it serves 'em right
But I come from a place where you burn or die
Or we turn and ride
So don't blame us when we turn to the dirt, we tried
I just pray we fly, yo

[Chorus: Raleigh Ritchie]
In case you think I've changed and I'm different
I'm not keeping you at a distance
So have a thought for me, yeah
Hold down this floor for me, yeah
Remember the time before things changed? Back in the day
Everything can stay the same
Remember I came? Remember my name?
Remember my face? I don't wanna fade away

[Outro: Raleigh Ritchie]
Don't cry for me
Just take a shot for me
Don't cry for me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't cry, oh no
Don't cry for me, no
