[Intro]
Yeah, yo

[Hook]
Call me Gunshot Mike or Mr Skeng
Check one-two, man skitzed again
Dickhead yout and a dickhead crew
Getting gassed up by your dickhead friends

[Verse 1]
It's like dem man woke up pissed again
If I buck these pricks again
I got goons and you got goons
But the difference is your shit pretends
And my niggas don't talk or rap
No, my niggas don't talk or clash
No, my niggas don't talk, they mash
Fuck boys, man, are you talking smack?
They said Stormzy can't be the king of grime
Cuh he can't do radio sets
Let's be real, rudeboy, I would light up a radio set
Like, really, I can't stand these fucking pricks
I don't care about your fucking whip
Mum, if you're listening, close your ears
But tell them paigons, suck my dick
I've had enough of them, they all piss me off
Had one chance, they missed the shot
I link up Flipz, then we burn your bridge
Then we laugh about it and split the prof

[Hook]
Call me Gunshot Mike or Mr Skeng
Check one-two, man skitzed again
Dickhead yout and a dickhead crew
Getting gassed up by your dickhead friends

[Verse 2]
I think I just got dissed again
Think I care who this offends?
Run up on man like Bale with aâ€“
Slap that through your shit defence
And I can still get a box imported
Said "don't worry 'bout the beef, it's sorted"
My man said he's a real gun shooter
Then my brother said "rah, that's awkward"
My man's never been bad, that's bullshit
Two weeks in the top ten, who called it?
Christmas, I went to war with the corporates
Like, big-up the ones that bought it
I do rap, then I do grime then I do rap
Then I sing and I roll right back
They said you ain't gonna blow like that
Who gives a fuck? You know, like that?
Ice in my cup come cold like that
Woah, we ain't even close like that
You know my style, know my stats
Don't talk bad if you don't talk facts
If I sign now, what's the buyout clause?
One top ten, five sold out tours?
Might fling a mixtape out when I'm bored
My life's okay, how about yours?
Brother, I'm good, I stay with the lord
Bible carrier, that's my sword
Matthew 12, so I don't talk
John 19's why I never got caught

[Hook]
Call me Gunshot Mike or Mr Skeng
Check one-two, man skitzed again
Dickhead yout and a dickhead crew
Getting gassed up by your dickhead friends

[Verse 3]
Back now, damn, I've missed the pen
Had one shot, you missed the pen
Bad man yutes with their bad man ways
What they wish for me, I don't wish for them
I don't pay them fools, never been told
Robbing phones outside Elliott School
Let me get a little bit of Henny, I'm cool
Many have come but many did fall away
What? You thought I was the one?
I was fourteen tryna buy me a gun
Most niggas doing what I did back then
So now I thank God for the guy I've become

[Hook]
That's Gunshot Mike or Mr Skeng
Check one-two, man skitzed again
Dickhead yout and a dickhead crew
Getting gassed up by your dickhead friends
Yeah, it's Gunshot Mike or Mr Skeng
Check one-two, man skitzed again
Dickhead yout and a dickhead crew
Getting gassed up by your dickhead friends

[Outro]
Yeah it's Gunshot Mike or Mr Skeng
Gunshot Michael or Mr Skeng
Gunshot Mike or Mr Skeng
Gunshot Mike or Mr Skeng
Yeah, it's Gunshot Mike or Mr Skeng
Gunshot Mike or Mr Skeng
You had one shot and you missed the pen, and that's
Flex, aye
