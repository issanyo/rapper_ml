The badboy ends, I'm from it
You ain't sick, I'm sick, I vomit
You don't lead that life, be honest
Us man, we've been around from day
You man, you came alive in college
Tell a man please don't fuck with my pay
Cuh a nigga needs take and I like my profit
Like God forgive me if I lock this rave
God forgive me if I lock this rave
Every MC wanna send for the kid
Yeah, they come and they go but the problem stays
Fuck bouncers, man, I'll bop them straight
Ain't been a town where I've lost my faith
Wait, you can get a box in your face
Straight, niggas ain't got what it takes
Man, niggas can't take my chain
Shower MCs when I make it rain
Pagan youts and their pagan ways
Man are old school like "state your name"
Man are old school like taking your phone on the bus
Yeah, man are from back in the day
All them boy dem can't come back to the bits
Little nigga go
Man'll edit man's face like Photoshop
Steel in my palm and I'm Robocop
You talk bad but we know you're not
Morning spliff and a Coco Pops
Look, riding around in a cab
Looking for the lightskin girl with the tats
Looking for brown skin girl with the clit piercing
And her white bredrin with the bag
Brudda, it's mad, man can't text me again
Tryna make dark skin sexy again
Tryna make your wifey sex me again
Boy dem wanna try get me again
Wait, man can't text me again
Tryna make your wifey sex me again
Tryna make your wifey sex me again
Boy dem wanna try get me again, look
Awks
I can make this ting awks
Somebody pass me the aux
Lord of the Mics, I roll with the orcs
Wait, awks
I can make this ting awks
Somebody pass me the aux
Lord of the Mics, I roll with the orcs, awks, aux
Man just talk
Six foot five, man, I'm far from short
Nicked with a shank, next day I went court
I'm a real G, don't care what you thought
I'm a real G, don't care what you bought
Care about your whip, don't care what
Back in the day and my man dem used to pop chains
But manaman meant
Look, switch up the ting when I bang out the flows
You can get bang out your clothes
Everybody talks real tough till they brang out the ghost
Everybody ran out the close
You can take the road out the man and the man out the road
But you'll never take the man out the soul
Oi, what you doing round here? Take your hand out your coat
You ain't gonna bang, you're a joke
Look, link Deepee then I twist up the dough
Yeah, I switch up the flows
