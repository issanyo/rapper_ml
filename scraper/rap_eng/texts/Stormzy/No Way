We a bunch of bad niggas
So it's 24 with them bad bitches

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
Look
Young nigga move that dope
You old niggas look so broke
Stay with the fam, yeah that's all of my bros
Used get paid from half of a brick, now I get paid from all my shows
Now I got a cup of some Goose and I'm zoning
Black shades and a suit and I'm rollin'
Go back to the booth then I'm bowling
Man I I drive this whip like it's stolen, all eyes on me
And niggas talk but no niggas odn;t ride on me
You niggas ain't gonna do nothin'
All that talk, man know that your bluffin'
Man send shots 'cause they know were above it
I can't trust my friends but I love 'em
It my time and I know that it's coming
Take two shots then I'm wavy
Couple close friends turned paigons
But it's all bless though
Might bring Yung Fume to my next show
Might bring a bad bitch, tell her get low
Niggas talk about P's but they are dead broke
Lowkey man you know how it get bros
See this is the life that we choose
We fucking these bitches, you nigga be wifin' these hoes
These nigga don't like me I know
