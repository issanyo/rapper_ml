[Verse 1: Stormzy]
Starts with a flame and a spark
When times feel rough and we light this up, get away from the dark
I just wish that you stayed from the start
But you turned so cold and you hurt my soul, now there's chains all over my heart
And you can say that you never done this, say that you never done that
I know what it is cuh every time you leave, girl, you come right back
But I've got chains all over my T-shirts and I've got chains all over my jumper
Bro told me "go and do your research" and I said no but now I just wonder

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
With her wine-stained lips, yeah she’s nothing but trouble
Cold to the touch but she’s warm as a devil
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
She tasted her break and I can’t get more

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
You got me in chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change, no I wouldn’t change this love
You got me chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change, no I wouldn’t change this love

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me
Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me

[Verse 3: Stormzy]
A hold on me but the hold don't last
Grown on me, yeah, I've grown up fast
Chains, they hurt but I don't say a word
Even though it burns when I still don't talk
Girl, why'd you do this?
When you know I'm wrapped up in that music
Girl, don't act up, I'm not stupid
Pull me down but I'm still not moving
Girl, just leave
That's starting to be my slogan
Heart on my sleeve
I'm starting to feel that pulsing
Like girl a freak, oh you had me locked
But them chains are broken
And you sound so weak, when you first met me
You were so outspoken
Tables turn, I roll my burn
I keep that rolling
You're so cold, so damn cold
And you get so frozen
These lonely roads, I lost my soul
I keep on strolling
Let's get things rolling
Yo Nick Jonas, go show them

[Chorus] + [Bridge]

[Refrain: Nick Jonas]
Baby tell me why, why you do, do me wrong
Baby tell me why, why you do, do me wrong
Gave you my heart but you took my soul

[Chorus]

[Outro: Stormzy]
Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me
