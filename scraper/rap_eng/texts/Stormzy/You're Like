[Intro/Hook]
1, 2, 3
You're like sugar, so sweet
I know this one's for me (yeah)
It don't matter whatever the weather
Cos you're mine, rain or shine (ayy)
And when I call you darling, can't help but smile
Time can stop forever, that will be fine
I'm where I wanna be, I really want to make you see
If they don't know nothin' else, they know I'm about you
Ayy

[Verse 1]
It's kinda crazy how we almost didn't last
It's so amazing how it's written in the stars
You hold a baby, you start wishing it was ours
Rest your head all on my chest so you can listen to my heart
You feel it? Beats faster when you're in my zone
You hold me harder when I'm going home
Cuh' you hate to see me leave and I hate to see the back of you
Wait, nah I love to see the back of you
Look, I'm only joking but jokes aside, I'm so grateful
How did my girlfriend become my guardian angel
How did this turn to an extra chair at the table
Got the blessings from my sisters, that's word to Ninny and Rachel, yeah
We made it, girl we really made it out
A couple fights, a couple trips but we came around
A couple nights, a couple slips, let me break it down
And girl I wrote this song for you so you can play it loud
And there's still some little things I'm tryna' comprehend
Like how you started filling up this empty void
And I wrote this song for you so you can show your friends
And tell them "my boyfriend's the best" until they get annoyed (check it)
The passion, yeah it proper burns
Watch you as you toss and turn but girl we got a lot to learn
Check, me and you, we make a team together
I just hope we get this dream together
