Pop a 16 bar for them
None of my sons I bar with them
The amount of peng tings that I
Ayy yo look, wagwan for them
Make me have to jump in my car for them
[?] the ones when I'm passing them
I know some kid from leeds that wear ... and cardigans
So don't judge a book by its cover
Cos you might be .. when you open it
I went ghost for like half of 2013
And I told my brothers make the most of it
Krept and Konan ... now look
I make ownership
Don't shot, oh my god
How you make prof when your smoking it?

The lightskin girls used to blank me
You say that I'm blick and lanky
Wow, how can she
I used to wild out and get angry
You know, the same girls that'll boy me
Now pull up to my car like "oii g"
What's your number, give it to me quick
Not a [?]

Look, I put my city on my shoulders
You ain't cold, I'm cold, I'm the coldest
Got my Adidas creps with my Nigo top, you can't get that yet, man are jokers
Yeah look, I made a tune with Nick Jonas
They said I sold out, that's bogus
I do a Fire in the Park, 9 million views, now it's album time and I focus
Look man, I'm the one they all fear
I was the man of the year last year
Now I'm the man of the year for the second year straight, like nobody don't compare
And now I'm sitting on the top and I'm looking straight down like, hold on is anybody there?
Shut down Malia, shut down Beats, oh my god this shit's not fair
Look man, I was on the roads when Dizzee made "Stop Dat"
You're not a badboy, stop that
Pengtings on my WhatsApp
Wait, Yeah they love when I drop that
Niggas still ask where'd I cop that
Jump in a new shaped Coupe then I dropped that
Face is bait so I drop back
Watched MCs wanna beg for their spot back

But brudda I'm calm
Play with fire and get harmed
Yeah everything's cool 'til I jump out the ride like yo, wah gwan
