[Intro]
Check one, check two
Skeng

[Verse]
Uh, I don't think highly of them man
That's why you won't find me with them man
Roll deep like Wiley and them man
Trapstar like Mikey and them man
Yo, uh, like
Niggas want gwop
I step out in my slippers and socks
I get love from the white boys up in Scotland
And love from my niggas in the block
Ps ain't long but I'm bigger than the boss
Know a couple real Gs in it for the gwop
Niggas ain't cold man, niggas just joke man
I'm so cold, I'm chilly when it's hot
Told my mum don't worry, I'm a boss
Wash that down with some voddy and Courvois'
Kill an MC, then I phone up his mum like
"I heard about your son, man, I'm sorry for the loss"
Old school days, me and Little Connie on the block
No two ways, man I'm bringing donny to the top
[?] on the left, got Flipz on my right
Bring [?] right in then I volley in the box
Just got the shower man pack
Real talk, they want the shower man back
Please stop telling me 'llow 'em with that
Shower man kicks in my shower man cap
Big black Ghana man come to lock off the dance
Yeah, they want the power man back
Six foot five, tower man that
Bare jealous youths look sour and that

[Hook]
I like all of my cars in black
Might whiz round to The Shard and back
Came out my yard to a clamp on my car
Come straight loose and the dumb car weren't taxed
Long story short, my car got scrapped
I got fined and my marge got a map
Anyway, back to the start of the track
Five bad chicks and a bottle of Yak
Five bad chicks and a bottle of Yak
Hoes in the front and the models in the back
One with the breasts and the model with the back
Five bad chicks and a bottle of Yak
Five bad chicks and a bottle of Yak
Five bad chicks and a bottle of Yak
Hoes in the front, models in the back
Five bad chicks and a bottle of Yak

[Verse 2]
Yo, MCs sniff coke and take pills
I don't do that, I stay trill
Talk guns and knives but it ain't real
The money's not big but it pays bills
Look, I don't care how they feel
I've got brothers on the roads that straight kill
I don't bust no guns but they will
I heard pagans were there but I came still
And I locked it off, you know my ting
Dropped her off, you know my ting
Drop the top, you know my ting
Get the gwop, you know my ting
You know me, I go right in
Black to fuck, I need lighting
Disrespect, I'll on sight him
I'll slap his face, I won't fight him
Look, I beat the tune, you get beat up
Beat the ting, you get feel up
I married the game and got prenup
Bun the dance and get wheel-ups
Look, I'm the chief, you get chiefed up
Look, easy bro, you best ease up
Look, I'm easy bro, you can't beef us
You're not greazy bro, you get greazed up

[Hook]

Five bad chicks and a bottle of Yak
Five bad chicks and a bottle of Yak
