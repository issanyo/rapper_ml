[Intro: Stormzy's Mum]
Hello, hello my son, good morning
I bet you are still sleeping
I just want to bless you this morning
May the God of Jehovah bless you
Guide you, protect you, everything you are doing
May the God lead you as he lead the Israelite to their promised land
God will lead you far
My son, I'm blessing you this morning
God will lead you far, okay?
Just put your trust and hope and everything in him
And he will take care of everything, okay?
God will bless you, in Jesus' name
Have a pleasant day, my lovely son
God bless you, bye

[Verse 1]
Your son did good, Mum
Swear down, man, your son did good, Mum
Know I used to run around with a budge, Mum
But I promise I was doing what I could, Mum
Now I made a little change, now we're good, Mum
I was saying I'mma get you out the hood, Mum
Take a selfie, show 'em how you look, Mum
Flex on 'em, let 'em know that we're good, Mum
See, back then I was bumping cabs
South of the Thames, where I come from's mad
Done some dirt and I ain't too proud
That you're living on the road where your son got stabbed
Man, I had you on the station, your son got nabbed
Tough luck, just mums, no dads
And we all know growing up in London's mad
Mummy ain't never seen a hundred bags

[Chorus]
So let 'em all know that my mumzy's glad
Yeah, I bought Mumzy a pad
Yeah, like, Mumzy, you're bad
Ghanaian queen, let 'em know that you're back
'Cause Mummy ain't never seen a hundred bags
Now I'm like, "Mum, buy a hundred bags"
Be right here whenever you need me
I need you to know that your son's got your back

[Verse 2]
Like, Mum, I owe you everything, can you believe that?
Everything, I'mma repeat that
And when I make a song, you give me feedback
I watched you plant the seeds and then you reap that
Made a little money from cheese, I let you keep that
Hid drugs but you probably couldn't see that
Young thug, missing colly like an eediot
Fucked up, saying sorry like I'm Three Stacks
Man, I just hope you can play this
All the times that you worked on a late shift
Just to see you come short on your payslip
Always in and out of beef with the bailiffs
Now I'm on the playlist
Yeah, where I come from's bad
Same old shit, just mums, no dads
And we all know growing up in London's mad
Mummy ain't never seen a hundred bags

[Chorus]
So let 'em all know that my mumzy's glad
Yeah, I bought Mumzy a pad
Yeah, like Mumzy you're bad
Ghanaian queen, let 'em know that you're back
'Cause Mummy ain't never seen a hundred bags
Now I'm like, "Mum, buy a hundred bags"
Be right here whenever you need me
I need you to know that your son's got your back, look

[Bridge]
Mum, I save it all for you
Listen to the words I say
No more broken promises, I promise this
So I save it all for you
Mum, I save it all for you
Listen to the words I say
No more broken promises
No more broken promises, I swear
No more broken promises, I swear
No more broken promises, I swear
No more broken promises, I swear
No more broken promises

[Outro]
Never seen a hundred bags
Now I'm like, "Mum, buy a hundred bags"
Never seen a hundred bags
Now I'm like, "Mum, buy a hundred bags"
Never seen a hundred bags
Now I'm like, "Mum, buy a hundred bags"
And I'll be right here whenever you need me
I need you to know that your son's got your back
Like, I swear
