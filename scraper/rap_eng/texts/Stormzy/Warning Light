[Refrain]
'Cause we’re here all night getting warm inside
They know what I mean nobody leaving 'til it's morning time
Let ’em fall in line, it's not a boring vibe
When your hands all clash and the cameras flash like a warning light
Like a warning light

[Verse 1: Nick Brewer]
Mind my boat
Big sea I'm just tryna float
Miss me it's no matter though
Sign I was thinking time to go
Let 'em inside they ain't getting a ride
When I get ripe I'll be setting a vibe
Never the type to be fretting a guys
Jekyll and Hyde got nothing to bribe, whoa
Bet it won't show
I ain’t scheming don’t know
I ain't leaving don’t go
Break even no dough
Flow like a bounce on a Pogo
Going up and down like a low blow
Have another round
I just want to shut it down like it won't close

[Chorus]
But why you never dance for?
Why you never dance for?
Even when the DJ's playing the song that you asked for
Get up on the dance floor, please don't make me ask more
I just want to see you move your feet don’t wanna start war

[Post-Chorus]
Why you never dance for?
Even when the DJ's playing the song that you asked for
Get up on the dance floor
I just want to see you move your feet don't wanna start war

[Refrain: Nick Brewer]
Cause we're here all night getting warm inside
They know what I mean nobody leaving 'til it's morning time
Let 'em fall in line, it's not a boring vibe
When your hands all clash and the cameras flash like a warning light
Like a warning light

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
Yo, why you come to the dance if you ain't gonna dance?
Come late night creep girl, come take a chance
(Come creep with us)
Got girls on the ends, got girls up in France
(Bonjour)
She loves me, can't do what I do and I do what they can't
(I do what they can't)
Stiff choco
(yeah?)
Rolled up with Reese in the Rocco
(True)
I just came into vibes and wave with the girls in the rave when a shout out yella
But live and let live it's all good here
(All good here)
Boss in the club you be good here
(You good here)
Why you just stood there?
(Why?)
Wait, why you wearing your hood here?

[Refrain: Nick Brewer]
'Cause we're here all night getting warm inside
They know what I mean nobody leaving 'til it's morning time
Let 'em fall in line, it's not a boring vibe
When your hands all clash and the cameras flash like a warning light

[Chorus]
But why you never dance for?
Why you never dance for?
Even when the DJ's playing the song that you asked for
Get up on the dance floor, please don't make me ask more
I just want to see you move your feet don't wanna stop, woah

[Verse 3: Nick Brewer]
Come down when they been up
Sign that they wanna wheel up
Wanna tell replay with the beat thump
Tryna believe that I'm fine on my feet
But I'm signing no prenup
Spitting a rhyme no need, bud
Giving the time no speed up
Think I'm shy no diva
Living my life they might be living a lie don't believe ya
And I don't hear what they say
See them eyeing on the come up
Forgotten about the same day
No dough but I wanna make change
Solo but I've got a brainwave
Low, low, never showboat
No goad on the game face

[Chorus]
But why you never dance for?
Why you never dance for?
Even when the DJ's playing the song that you asked for
Get up on the dance floor, please don't make me ask more
I just want to see you move your feet don't wanna start war

[Post-Chorus]
Why you never dance for
Even when the DJ's playing the song that you asked for
Get up on the dance floor
I just want to see you move your feet don't wanna start war

[Refrain: Nick Brewer]
'Cause we're here all night getting warm inside
They know what I mean, nobody leaving 'til it's morning time
Let 'em fall in line, it's not a boring vibe
When your hands all clash and the cameras flash like a warning light
Like a warning light
