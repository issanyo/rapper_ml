He said "trust me, it's all in the mind"
He said "Pow 2004" shut down
Leeds Fest 2009
Like 10 years from it first got played
And it still holds weight after all this time
Man can't ever tell me 'bout grime
I spray bars and my enemies die
Walk in the rave with a smile on my face
Yeah, I do my ting though I've never been signed
You've only got one flow? Ah, never mind
Everybody hates so I hate them too
You wanna talk like you're down for the hype
But let's be real, fam, you ain't that dude, word
