[Intro]
Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3, we live?
(Yeah, yeah)
This is for all those people who said grime was gonna fail, hahahaha
(And it goes like this, yo, man get killed by the London posse #MERKY2017)

[Verse 1: Saskilla]
Thank-thank God that I woke up healthy
'Cause a don could've died in my sleep
But anyway, I'ma grind 'til I'm wealthy
Nothing ain't promised in the world, man it's peak
Like the mount of Kilimanjaro
Know that I'm sharp, know that I'm hard, know that I'm cold
Know that you're never gonna see man with a gas pipe, [?]
Know that I clocked this game, know that I cocked his face
Next time I see him on stage at Eskimo Dance, I'ma reload him and his mates
But anyway fuck that, ain't tryna sound violent
Young, black, British with a knack for them sirens
Them [?] got stopped in a Vectra
Now I'm in the States and I'm known like Skepta
Nigga

[Hook: Stormzy]
Go figga
Go figga
Go figga, I see bare fuckboys, no killers
Go figga
Go-go figga
Go figga, mans think that they're big, I'm bigger

[Verse 2: Saskilla]
I told Wiley wait on the album
I'm gonna shut down grime for the year
All these dons with their dibby-dibby songs
I really [?] think their career
Did a couple features with a couple of the mandem, yeah 1.5 there was spare
I was in the sticks tryna help with your gap between U.K. grime and American rap
One-one-forty BPM strapped to my back
In the strip club with a stack and a yat
Man was in studio teaching them one line flows, our slang and a whole load of crap
They're like 'Sas, the grime shit crazy
The way that you skip on the beat, it amaze me'
I'm like 'Cool fam, man say nothing big
Grime when it weren't cool, man say something so nigga'

[Hook: Stormzy]
Go figga
Go figga
Go figga, I see bare fuckboys, no killers
Go figga
Go-go figga
Go figga, mans think that they're big, I'm bigger

[Verse 3: Saskilla]
Nu Brand Flexx in this bitch
Nu Brand Flexx in this bitch
Man have got the pain in my veins so even on my deathbed, know that I'm repping this shit 'til I'm buried in shit
Got your wifey up in my crib
No hands, straight spit while she's sucking my dick
Send her home full of cum, make you suck on her clit
Give a lot of wasteman put a ring on that bitch
Boom, back to the matter at hand
Who thinks they're badder than man when I'm stacking them grands
I was in Napa and 'Dam way before likes on the 'Gram
I was the man, forty man rolling with man
And that's the fans, not the gang
The [?], tell me now what is the plan?
South on this, I don't give a damn

[Hook: Stormzy][x2]
Go figga
Go figga
Go figga, I see bare fuckboys, no killers
Go figga
Go-go figga
Go figga, mans think that they're big, I'm bigger
