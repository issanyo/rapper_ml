[Intro]
You know WildBoyAce made it

[Hook: C Biz]
I can do this shit all on my own
I can do this shit all on my own
I can take the game all on my own
Started off here all on my own
I can do this shit all on my own
I can take the game all on my own
I can do this shit all on my own
Started off here all on my own

[Verse 1: Stormzy]
Yo, I can do this shit all on my own, comfy
Niggas said they're coming for my throne, bullshit
Cutting through the 7 with my bros, trust me
Rappers started wifeying my hoes, awkward
Got the something there, I keep it close, rusty
Got it just to keep 'em on their toes, full clip
I think them man are running out of dough, they must be
Sick, someone's ringing up my phone, pause it
I just stay smoking my weed, these man are molly popping
Please don't get my bruddas all greazed, they'll get to body dropping
Bruddas flying from overseas to grab a shotty off him
Catch me in the club with my Gs, catch me Vossi bopping
Bossy to the brink of your cup, sprinkle it up
You niggas just ain't fit to be thugs, you niggas is fucked
They're saying they'll be sticking me up like nigga, you nuts?
Think they thought my city was buck, my city is fucked

[Hook: C Biz]
I can do this shit all on my own
I can do this shit all on my own
I can take the game all on my own
Started off here all on my own
I can do this shit all on my own
I can take the game all on my own
I can do this shit all on my own
Started off here all on my own

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
They're saying that that Stormzy yout is fucked, avoid him
Thornton Heath to Norbury to the Lane, Croydon
Talking up on Twitter like you're brave
Put him in a rave, man dem slapped him in his face, boy ting
They're stepping out in Loubs but I'm cool, I've got my sliders on
Bruddas, they just talk, they don't shoot, them man are cyber dons
Fire when I step in the booth, I'll put my visor on
A minute till I punch off your face, I'll put my timer on
Shit's getting spooky, I swear, it's getting clear
Tricks wanna rub on my beard, I'm getting scared
I weren't meant to kill their careers, they're getting aired
Flipz ain't said a word in a week, it's getting weird
Come on, bro, come on, just speak, are you OK?
Said "brudda, don't worry 'bout me, fuck up the game"
I said "the hunger's all that I need, it cut through my veins"
These niggas wanna act like they're Gs but tuck in their chains

[Hook: C Biz]
I can do this shit all on my own
I can do this shit all on my own
I can take the game all on my own
Started off here all on my own
I can do this shit all on my own
I can take the game all on my own
I can do this shit all on my own
Started off here all on my own
