Paigons in my face
Please get out my face
Please stay in your lane
We are not the same

The amount of peng tings that I've beat
Is OP
Nigga pack down and stay in your seat
Before I let my young G come off of that leash

I banged out, that's all me
No handouts, that's all me
Put a man down, that's all me, all me for real
I came up thats all me
Stay fucked, thats all me
Never gave up, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1: Stormzy]
Like
How do I start my verse?
All these rappers I killed
No management deal, man
I laugh so much it hurts
Yeah
I used to write bars in church
Please if you're going to go use my flow
Then don't be rude come ask me first
Your men've got cheek
Your men are not me
I still freestyle but my talent ain't cheap
I link my bro Inch, done a mandem just creep
I'm a let that breath
Peng tings on my Whatsapp
Peng tings on my facetime too
If a nigga ever had girl like yours
Then let's be real I'm a hate mine too
All I see is fuckboys
And some uck-faces
Don't slip in these dumb places
My white girl from croydon town
Got a cool dad but her mums racist
She ain't never seen a nigga so black
Nigga sold packs
When you niggas were in bed
I was dead broke
Cooking food with some dough in it
And it don't get realer than that

[Verse 2: Deepee]
Boom
I came up it was all hard being blick
I came in with my balls harder than my dick
I came up from a quarter, of a quarter, of a quarter of a brick
If you see I then you might see Swift
Eyes on a ride on the side with [?]
I smile at pricks
Give a boy debt or its mental
I didn't even write this shit
Shit, hold up pussyboy thinking a crud
When in school you was never [?] and a slug
I'm good with machines try and call my bluff
Sugaring your teeth you think I'm a mug
I rave for my bud, its boring
Of course I was bored, and I bought [?]
Crud
Section Boyz to the blood
All we send is a frog, gorillas in the mud,                     [xD][?]
When enough of the wanna be us
Been about a bus that's word to the buds
Switching it up that's word to the plot
I've been getting rid of a few [?] dudes
Word to the resedue on my gloves
I ain't a bad man but I bang shit
When them man only bang bang in their ad lips
Saying that they [?] nigga where your girl is
You were holding up her boo-bag  [?]
Wankers
I've been tell a boy have standards
All five ain't shocking niggas with blankers
Schooltimes up know them niggas at random
[?] and my attitude stanking

[Verse 3: Stormzy]
I touched down in 93
7th month from the 26
Paigons like to talk loads
Saying stuff that they never did
I geet mad love from my Croydon boys
Told them that I'm good in south
My brown one got that mad pussy
Lord forgive me I ain't pulling out
My Paigon said when he catches me
He's going to do his thing so be wary
Oh, how scary
I swear down man you niggas don't scare me
Still take dumps on your favourite rapper
Little one ounce dont make you a trapper
And I still roll with my big bro mike
Hes just like me nigga I'm so dapper
I'm in your girls bed in my boxers
All them fuckboys are imposters
Call me Big Mike, Big Mighty Joe
Mr. Text Your Girl or Stiff Choclate
In like 06 I was clashing man
Told donny go suck your mum
He said why all of that mum talk
I told donny go suck your mum
You can ask Rhymes
Don't ask what I paid that car is mine
Don't ask what it weights man a harsh fine
Just ask [?]
I kill rappers like a [?]
Some girls want to be cuddled
And some just wanna get clarted
When your see this nigga at the top
Just know I ain't forgot about the place that I started
