[Intro: Stormzy & Vula Malinga]
Yeah
Mmmm
Radio 1 Live Lounge
Yeah
Let's go, ayy
'Cause you're sweet like chocolate
Oh, yeah, you're sweet like chocolate, boy

[Verse 1: Stormzy]
Yo, it's live, It's stiff chocolate
All the girls wanna jump in the moshpit
I had food in the car but I tossed it
And then I came in the game and I bossed it
Yeah, they're like: Stormzy you mocked it
Never let my bros in so I locked it
I've got a lock on the game I'm a locksmith
Like, nobody can across this
Look, I used ped on my back and get the food in
I never settle in life, I'm never losin'
I try and level the tide then let my goons in
They call me [?] look at my smooth skin
Have a hell of a night, we on tour

[Pre-hook: Stormzy]
Wagwan, guten tag and bonjour
Captain Mike, you're welcome on board
Stiff chocolate, sexy girls that want more (hey)

[Hook: Stormzy & Vula Malinga]
Oh yeah, you're sweet like chocolate, boy (yeah)
You're sweet like chocolate (stiff chocolate ayy)
You bring me so much joy (so much joy)
You're sweet like chocolate, boy (and it goes like)

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
If I eat, my sister eats too
Showtime Michael Mister GQ (hey)
I'm too fly them boys want beef oo
I'm too fly them boys can be few
Like, they wanna see me fall off but I can't fall
Don't wanna see me get stamps on my passport
They wanna see a brother down so I dance more
Now I got your baby mother on the dance floor
I've got bars for days, I've got flows
Everytime I touch the mic they say: [?]
Yeah, like, man that's some kings you don't know
50 shades of black I still glow
Rude boy bring the yak, I'm on tour

[Pre-hook: Stormzy]
Wagwan, guten tag and bonjour
Captain Mike, you're welcome on board
