[Verse 1: P Money]
I just wanna make music
Hit the studio, create music
My fans purchase, download and play music
Seek melody, metaphor and rave music
That chill on the sofa and play music
Don't want a beat, just wanna play music
Who am I kidding? I'll beat when I play music and
If her boyfriend is talking smack
I've got that lead your girlfriend away music
I've got that wild, you've got that tame music
I've got that real, you've got that lame music
I've got that cosign, labels wanna sign the work of art
Belong in the Tate music
Grime, rap, UK bass music
That real easy to embrace music, and
Any MC that is thinking they're rough
I've got that punch a man in their face music
That serve you a backhand ace music
Black, white, don't watch race music
Still here, kept my faith music
Ten years, never made no fake music
Man have been making that great music
You need to make that stay in your lane music
Cuh 2016, I'll be touring Australia
Second time round like

[Bridge: P Money]
I've been killing shows with no deal
I always keep it down to earth, I'm so real
I'm ready, I'm itching to go, can't sit still
They're so fake, they don't even know how it feels when you're

[Hook: P Money]
Trill, keeping it real
Trill, keeping it real
Trill, keeping it real
Trill, keeping it real
Trill, they don't even know
How it feels when you're
Trill, keeping it real
Trill, keeping it

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
If you're gonna send then send for the top
Look, trust me, I get it (calm)
I'll take that shot and I'll take that shot
Yeah, I'm photogenic (calm)
But when I spray back and I ended careers
Don't tell me to dead it ('llow it)
Bare of these MCs hate me
But they still see me and beg it (pussies)
And I still came back with the game on my lap
Like "nobody move" (no one)
Tryna take care of my Gs
Ain't tryna see nobody lose
But man try come for my team, I'll dun him off
My man thought he's a G, stop running off
I've got a crown and you've got a crown
But rudeboy, this crown here ain't coming off ('llow it)

[Bridge: P Money]
I've been killing shows with no deal
I always keep it down to earth, I'm so real
I'm ready, I'm itching to go, can't sit still
They're so fake, they don't even know how it feels when you'ree

[Hook: P Money]
Trill, keeping it real
Trill, keeping it real
Trill, keeping it real
Trill, keeping it real
Trill, they don't even know
How it feels when you're
Trill, keeping it real
Trill, keeping it

[Verse 3: P Money]
Yo, I was one of the youngers that you couldn't send shop
Yeah, I was a mummy's boy, but never soft
I boxed man that thought they couldn't get boxed
Topped MCs that thought they couldn't be topped
When I flow on the riddim, I never get lost
When you flow on the riddim, you're told "get lost"
Labels wanna know how I keep going hard
Thought I took a pill cuh my ting never went flop
Complete control, I could never get dropped
There was never a show that never went off
Milking it for so long and it never went off
Don't know why, maybe it's cause I never went pop
Helped out the game, man did that a lot
Bring us down to festivals, did that a lot
Man can chat shit about me doing dubstep
Told grime police man never bread cops
So I still spray on dubstep now, and what?
Wait, cut the beat out, let me talk to these lot
Let's talk P, I'm on about me
First grime act packing at Wireless? Me
Spraying on "Eskimo" at Wireless? Me
Five years straight and still tireless? Me
When everybody got a deal and did what they feel
Who was here releasing grime CDs? Me and Jme
Grime tracks on every single EP? Me
Young MC that was duppying pirate? Me
Big MC still duppying pirate? Me
Doing shows worldwide, play a man's vocal
Showing their country that it's not just me
Who was doing that at the time? No one, me
There was more but I can't fit it in a sixteen
Man just better respect me

[Bridge: P Money]
I've been killing shows with no deal

Trill, keeping it real
Trill, keeping it real
