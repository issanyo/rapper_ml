Word on the road, you're the birthday girl
Don't be sad on your birthday, girl
Sittin' in the club like you didn't wanna come
So I send a couple bottles to the birthday girl
Ay, you're the birthday girl
Do what you like, you're the birthday girl
Them girls watch face, but yeah, it's all bait
That them chicks will hate on the birthday girl
You're the birthday girl, you're the birthday girl
You're the birthday girl, you're the birthday girl
You're the birthday girl, you're the birthday girl
You're the birthday girl, you're the birthday girl

[Verse 1]
Your day started off with some bullshit
Should have started off with some breakfast
I know you're standin' outside with your bredrens
'Cause you never put your names on the guest list
And your iPhone screen just smashed
I can see it in your eyes that you're restless
I walk over like if you wanna walk straight in
Show the bouncers what you've been blessed with
You started laughin', boy, you're so dumb
Fuck them bouncers, tell your girls, "Come"
Take these wristbands, go and have fun
Yeah, what the hell, you're only 22 once
You said, "How comes you ain't coming in?"
Then I told you, "I gotta go leave for my tour"
You said, "Thank you for saving my day"
I said, "That's what heroes are for"

You're the birthday girl, you're the birthday girl
You're the birthday girl, you're the birthday girl

[Verse 2]
Your day started off with some bullshit
Should have started off with some birthday sex
A little kiss and a happy birthday text
With you runnin' 'round in your birthday dress, so
Forget all the birthday stress
You're the birthday queen, what's the drama?
I'll be your shinin' knight, where's my armour?
It's only right that you wear a tiara
Girl, you're a princess, do as you please
It's your day, baby, go and take leave
I'ma do all that I can so we stick the plan
Go ahead, go and live your dreams
'Cause I'll be right here, 12:01
When everybody's gone and your birthday's done
We'll play this song and we'll roll one more
We'll take some shots till the daylight comes, Stormz

[Phone Call Interlude]
Yo, princess
I just come to wish you a very, very happy birthday
I hope this is an incredible one for you
I hope God blesses you this year
And I hope you're havin' an amazing, amazing, amazing birthday
Lots of love
Love you always
