[Verse 1]
Uwokuthathwa sponono (you're worth taking)
You give me joy and a whole lot more
When I deal le dikoloto (when I deal with debts)
I never stop, never let you go
Wamuhle Sthandwa sami (you're so beautiful My Loving)
Wa dikoti Marameng (with your dimples)
Aow yeah, Aow yebo (oh, yeaH oh YeaH)

[Chorus]
Well, I don't know who you are or where you come from
But I know that I'd go anywhere with you
Where the days are always dark or where the sun shone
Or maybe Timbuktu

[Verse 2]
Ngithi ngiyaziqhenya ngawe ungumuntu wam Sthandwa Sam
You are my star and my Moonlight I'll give you all my love
Wamuhle Sthandwa sami [yeah, aaah]
Ka dikoti Marameng [yeah, aaah]

[Chorus]
Well, I don't know who you are or where you come from
But I know that I'd go anywhere with you
Where the days are always dark or where the sun shone
Or maybe Timbuktu
Maybe Timbuktu

[Refrain]
Come along (Hey, hey, hey)
Come along (Hey, hey, hey)
Come a-, come along
Timbuktu

[Verse 3]
Man a big man now, still a man and not bitch
We had to put the skins down and put the pen on our hips
I got your babes and your babe mothers sending me pics
Guess I'm just a legend like Chris
You know I had to get the stage laid just in case my melanin drips
You know, black gold all over my denims and shit
I guess I'm ready to dip, feeling very legit
But Timbuktu, that's a hell of a trip
Alright, I swear on your mum's life that you really love me
I fly out now and drop everything to be with you
This doesn't come twice, all we got is one life
I was on the fence who was doing what you needed to
Then they hit you with the beetlejuice
Scary how the mother bird has treated you
So meet me at terminal five, put all your burdens aside, give you a permanent life
Now get your arse on this plane

[Chorus]
Well, I don't know who you are or where you come from (Where you come from)
But I know that I'd go anywhere with you (Go anywhere with you)
Where the days are always dark or where the sun shone (Where the sun shone)
Or maybe Timbuktu
Well, I don't know who you are or where you come from (Where you come from)
But I know that I'd go anywhere with you
Where the days are always dark or where the sun shone (Where the son shone)
Or maybe Timbuktu
Maybe Timbuktu

[Outro]
Maybe Timbuktu (La, la, la)
Maybe Timbuktu (La, la, la)
Maybe Timbuktu (La, la, la)
'Buktu
Ooh, whoa
