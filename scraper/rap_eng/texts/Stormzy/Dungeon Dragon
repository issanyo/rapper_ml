[Verse 1: Cadet]
I am not Aladdin, no, I am a genie
So far ahead that my shadow can't see me
Believe me, something 'bout the swagger von deezy
Gucci outfit has got me covered in GG
Rah, rah, got me covered in GG
Gucci outfit has got me covered in GG
And if you get to talking like you're mobbin' on me G
A headshot and then I'm Audi like a TT
Yeah, I said it, TT
Gun roll waistcoats, freebies
Cadet, stop it
I don't beef with knuckles or gauntlet
I grab the desi for niggas who acting heavy
Never thought it would get messy but it's ringing like my celly
C-A-D-D-D-D-D-D, I can feel it in my belly
Way you slaughtering the tunes, you got me feeling like you're Freddy
All I need is a bottle of the Martel
I go hard, I never go like Vybz Kartel
Bury man around eleven feet, you would pass hell
They know I'm pissing on the game like R. Kell
They don't wanna battle with me cuh I'm so raw
Heard every one of your tunes, so poor
Shit's easily kicked off like an old door
Rob Ps and rob her Ps, cold sore

[Hook 1: Cadet]
Rah, rah, yeah, the guns be banging
Rah, rah, yeah, the guns be banging
Rah, rah, yeah, the guns be banging
Yeah, the guns be banging, yeah, the guns be banging
Rah, rah, yeah, the guns be banging
Rah, rah, yeah, the guns be banging
Rah, rah, yeah, the guns be banging
Yeah, the guns be banging, yeah, the guns be banging

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
I ain't one to boast but my shit's off the chain
18, I'mma take the piss out the game
Got the whole scene wrapped in a little bit of Riz
But the spliff just dropped, I ain't billing it again
You don't like it? Then fuck off, bitch
Every last prick on the ends I'll mug off and you still couldn't fight back
Jakes got my line tapped, cut off, I make the something buss off
Gets peak, guarantee they run off
Walk in the shubs, turn the lights on
Find a yout with ice on
Somebody's pissed that they become my dons
Could never [?] dons, check one two, turn my mic on
Prick, get rude? That's your life gone
I swear to God that they won't like it when I'm coming
Have 'em running, I don't rave unless the bouncers let my gun in
And I'm all about my guala, putting money first like Yungen
And the way a nigga's talking makes a nigga wanna bun him, yeah
All I need is a bottle of the Henny
Plus the all-black swag has got me looking like I'm Pecky
If he's burny, man will wet him up or hit him with the semi
I ain't tryna be the baddest, I'm just tryna hit the belly
Talking like you're bad, don't beg it
The girlies and the guala, yeah, we get it
I make the something ring, no credit
Eff it, rasclart Stormzy and Cadet
Got my dons locked like some dungeon dragons
We be OT up in country slanging
Waved off, chilling with the blunt and the magnum
Plus I'm sick in the head, call me Marilyn Manson, but

[Hook 2: Stormzy]
Rah, rah, yeah, my guns be banging
Rah, rah, yeah, my guns be banging
Rah, rah, yeah, my guns be banging
Yeah, my guns be banging, yeah, my guns be banging

[Verse 3: Cadet]
Is this the thanks I get for bringing you niggas in?
Is it my fault that you couldn't aim his ting?
You was aiming, arm was shaking, saying how you'd get to blazing
But I dodged it and evaded it and smacked him in his shin
Man, they just mad and they ain't got your punches
Doing ACs and working on the abs like it's crunches
How you gon' forget? You a motherfucker B
Fam, I'm C-A-D-d-d-det-D-d-d-det, me
I hear the mumbling, I hear the cackling
But beefing me? There's no chance, nobody be backing him
They really wanna swing but they say knives got a smack on it
The luger ruger roots to have you stiffer than a mannequin
You wanna sleep on C? Overnight
Swing till there's not a thing left, you can hold a right
Niggas know the swag Cad's smoother than the Dolemite
And if I swing, you better lean back like you hold a kite
You see my shiny arse brudda, my brudda?
Where I'm going with the food, you should be saying walla
Sorry, man, I'm tired of your voice, say nada
You can lose your head right now, just a tada

[Outro: Cadet]
