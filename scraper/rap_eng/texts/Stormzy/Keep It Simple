[Verse 1: Raleigh Ritchie]
The city light's in my eyes
And I can feel the night creepin' through the cloudy skies
And it's raining again, this is a blue town
And I feel a Gene Kelly moment comin' on, I've got the moves now
And I feel like laughing all the time
And I don't know why, there's a lot going through my mind
And though I don't know you, the prospect's there
Still so much to show you, so I don't care

[Chorus: Raleigh Ritchie]
This time around, hold it down
Got to keep it simple, keep it underground
I can't help how it felt
I just wanna shout, wanna say it loud

[Verse 2: Raleigh Ritchie]
Love on the Thames
Can we do it all again tomorrow?
Everything ends
But I don't want to fill another day with sorrow
I, I, I know I can take, take the love and the heartbreak
Cause I've been a teenager, obvious dumb statements
I'm full of shit sometimes
But walking beside you's blowing my mind
I feel so high, mmm, we own the night, mmm
How did I find the light of my life in so little time?

[Chorus: Raleigh Ritchie]
This time around, hold it down
Got to keep it simple, keep it underground
I can't help how it felt
I just wanna shout, wanna say it loud

[Verse 3: Stormzy]
Yo, a million thoughts in my brain
You'd rather drive in the sun, I'd rather walk in the rain
Thinkin' 'bout the future, 'bout my future, bought her a Range
Stepped in shit and threw my kicks, I never wore 'em again
I'm livin' carefree, ain't got a care in the world
I came with the mandem but I'm here by myself
Cuh my mind's at home but my body's in the rave
I'd rather buy myself a cake that I can share with my girl
Chill out on the sofa as we watch it
Watchin' episodes of Friends, I need the box set
They say I'm back, I tell 'em that I never lost it
Used to make 'em run and now I got 'em doin' moshpits

[Chorus: Raleigh Ritchie]
This time around, hold it down
Got to keep it simple, keep it underground
I can't help how it felt
I just wanna shout, wanna say it loud

[Outro: Raleigh Ritchie]
She makes it hard for me, and
It takes a lot to fool her
And me, I'm cowardly, so
Maybe I just won't call her
