[Verse 1: Perrie]
Hold up, no, you didn't bow, bow
I ain't the chick to walk behind you around town
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down south
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it lying down, baby

[Refrain: Jesy & Perrie]
Oh, I'm a machine when I do it
I'll be catching fire, gasoline when I do it
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down south
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it lying down, baby

[Chorus: Jade]
You're the man, but I got the, I got the, I got the power
You make rain, but I'll make it, I'll make it, I'll make it shower
You should know, I'm the one who's in control
I'll let you come take the wheel, as long as you don't forget

[Post-Chorus]
Who got the power
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power
Hold Up!

[Pre-Verse: Jesy]
My turn

[Verse 2: Jesy]
I make this look easy, tick Tick, boom, like gasoline-y
Yeah, they call me Lamborghini, 'cause I know just what I'm worth
Zero to a hundred, b-b-body make' em stutter
Start my engine, push the button, 'cause I'm gon' be coming first

[Refrain: Leigh-Anne & Jade]
Oh, I'm a machine when I do it
I'll be catching fire, gasoline when I do it
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down south
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it lying down, baby

[Chorus: Leigh-Anne with Jade]
You're the man, but I got the, I got the, I got the power
You make rain, but I'll make it, I'll make it, I'll make it shower
You should know, I'm the one who's in control
I'll let you come take the wheel, as long as you don't forget

[Post-Chorus]
Who got the power
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power
I got the
Who got the power
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power
I got the
Hold up!

[Verse 3: Stromzy & Leigh-Anne]
When them boys talk loose and tell you power's for a king (huh?)
You just play it cool and tell 'em power's not a thing (what?)
You look him in the eye and say, "I know I'm not a guy
But see there's power in my losses and there's power in my wins"
Independent woman, look to shower in your Bimms
They call me coco butter Mike, you can't be powderin' my skin
And you don't need to spend another hour in the gym
You know I'm blinded by his grace but when you found me I was dim
And we'll be countin' down the years, yeah I'm about this
All them dirty secrets that we share, I'll clear the browsers
We the type to build on our careers and share the houses
You can be a woman and a boss and wear the trousers at the same time
You should know, that I ain't never lettin' go
But as long as I'm alive, then I'll be sponsorin' your pride
You know there's power in a couple, let me compliment your vibe, yo

[Chorus: Perrie, All & (Leigh-Anne)]
As long as you don't forget
You're the man, but I got, I got, I got the power
You make rain, but I'll make it, I'll make it, I'll make it shower
You should know, I'm the one who's in control
(I'm in control, now)
I'll let you come take the wheel, as long as you don't forget

[Post Chorus: Jade and Leigh-Anne]
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power
Cause I got, I got, I got the power
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power
Baby, don't forget, I got the power, yeah
The power, yeah, yeah-eh

[Outro: Jesy]
Motorbike, motorbike, motorbike, motorbike
Bike, bike, bike, bike
Bike, bike, bike, bike, bike, bike, whoop
