[Skit: Stormzy]
The time has come to make a choice:
To become a functioning member of society
Or to change the way society functions.
You see, God-given ability got you through these gates,
But ability is all too common around these hallways
It is the endless dedication to those gifts,
The tireless pursuits of excellence
That will carry you through graduation and beyond
Your unrealistic dreams have paid the price of admission
And your tragedies have enrolled you in triumph
Mastery is an endless flat pan,
But it's time to build your rocket
