[Verse 1: Stormzy]
She's a woman with a cause and I'm a man without a reason
Capture all these moments, get em crammed into a keyring
Mirror's on the wall, I'll put some cameras on the ceiling
See, I'll catch her if she falls, I'm not a fan of catching feelings but
We seem to have these random little meetings where we
Talk about my exes and the man dem you've been seeing and I
Tell you 'bout my groupies, where my fans are at, they're screaming
Then you go and screw your face, you throw a tantrum and I'm leaving like
So tell me where your angle is
Give you thug passion, or a dinner with a candle lit
I see your phone flashing, and I don't know how to handle this
Cause the same hands I used to rub you down, I wanna strangle with
See, she can bring out the worst, the best in me
You can either destroy or invest in me
I give you all I've got, there's nothing really left to me
I wear my heart right on my sleeve, now wear it on your chest for me but

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
I don't need you, I don't need you, I don't need you, I don't need you
But I want you
I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I love you

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
So tell me, what do you believe in?
Cuh you tell me you're in love and I'm still tryna find the meaning
I'm just trying not to fall, but see the thought of it's appealing
So I'm drowning in this liquor just to filter out the feeling but
I guess I'm just a human being
And that makes me a sucker
When all the girls I fuck are fucking cheating
It's so hard for me to think that you're just not one of the others
I can't give her a chance, give me my space
Why you so harsh? Give her a break
Used to sit in the dark on the estate and I
Gave you my heart just to escape, but
I'm [?] back you don't belong to
You just love to chat, you told me that I'm wrong for you
I just state the facts and turn it into a song for you
But you don't play it, once you hear it, it gets long for you but

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]

[Bridge: Stormzy]
Told me that I'm bad for you, told me not to chat to you
Gave you all this space and now you come in with this attitude
You know you're special though, so unforgettable
But all this beefing in public is unprofessional
I know you sit and wait up by the telephone, but I never phone
But girl, I told you I'll show up the minute you're finished and you decide to grow up
I'm just hoping your decision's before I make it and blow up

[Outro: Jhene Aiko]
I don't need you, I don't need you, I don't need you, I don't need you
I still you
I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I, but I love you

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
