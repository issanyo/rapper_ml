[Verse 1: Stormzy]

Fuck your fake love you can keep it
Niggas that are starving are the bruddas that I eat with
Didn't wanna holla now they want me on that remix
The same bitches that I couldn't get on, now the ones I sleep with
It's all crazy man, because shit was never like this just a year ago
I don't get excited because there's still another year to go
Kill these other rappers I said only if you dare me bro
Iv'e been going in but i don't think they really hear me though
Yo dice turn my mic up
Murmz get the torch, we gon' make the city light up
I just speak my thoughts so its unlikely that they like us
And all these niggas talk till I come around and fuck your life up
Look, how can i trust my girl in our relationship
When I be fucking girls who tell me that they're in relationships
Trust issues make me fuck around and take the piss
And see these broken hearts and then i pick them up and play with it
I don't need to, really I don't need to
But just know I still got, all the things that we've been through
All these niggas talk but they say nothing when they see you
People pick up new personas I prefer it when you be you
And people say I've changed, but I don't believe them because Mark said i'm the same
Nowadays I leave them to just say what they're saying
Got like a five man squad because all my friends are moving strange
Nah, I don't want them niggas near me
Because Lord knows the way these niggas change is scary
And I ain't' saying you should fear me but my brethrens always tell me that I need to loosen up
Or come out for a drink and say I need to leave my house
But I just saw my brother chilling with one of my pagans chilling with one of the niggas that I beefing right now
So I just walk out and feel the (?) in the air
Murmz said chill nothing can happen when i'm here
I stopped bugging out, it's not the madness that I fear
It's just the last time this happened mandem ran and disappeared
Drunk words and sober thoughts
The truth is painful and these words have no remorse
I don't tell 'em nothing because these niggas known to talk
They killed his fucking brother but they couldn't show the corpse
Because them niggas got him bad man, them niggas really got him
Shot him in the face for the shit that he was shottin
Now his mum can't even open up the coffin and his sisters in a daze saying he should of let them rob him
His mums pleading for a witness to the murder
Because son's friends know but they won't tell her and it burns her
She comes back to see her eldest with a burner then she drops on to the floor and says don't take this any further
Both start crying then she takes the gun away
Looks down at the gun and says she wants to run away
Backs up from the table says they took my son away
Then he stands up mum put the fucking gun away
