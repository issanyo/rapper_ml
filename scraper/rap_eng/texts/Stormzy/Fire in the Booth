[Instrumental 1]
A rock and a hard place
Things get tossed in a car chase
Don't get lost in the fast pace
Certain man bussing few shots, turn to Scarface
My god
Guess your man dem ain't built like ours
Tell a boy come then I make a boy run
You can go and buy a gun but you can't buy a heart
Look, I was in the street with the shooters
Then I swapped my beef for a future
Used to link my mans for some weed
Now I call up T for a link for producers
Niggas better get with the movement
What's a washed up vet to a student?
Days in the trap, ten man tryna share one flat
Lord knows it was gruesome, man are nuisance
I do this cause it's light work, get a life first
How you gonna try and order my slice?
We didn't even work for the cake, fuck's sake
But you wanna try and force it on man
Bruddas getting so angry, I'm anti
Listen, I don't wanna talk, I'mma write
Man said he's the coldest in grime
Man would've thought that I died
Look, nigga, have some respect
Went to my show and came back with a cheque
Couple man used to get slapped in the head
Now men are talking like the bad that is dead
That is not cool, I can't respect it
Me plus twenty-two goons on the guest list
Man ain't ever been slewed, I'm respected
Sending for me? That was expected
Yeah, straight, man I'm talking the truth
Yo six, there's a corpse in the booth
Roll out Squady, man stay squady
Bass in my whip, feel the force of my coupe
Base in my clique, feel the force in my crew
Yeah, my mate's got a stick and he walks with it too
I does what I normally do
Let me talk to the boss, I ain't talking to you, little small fry
Fuck your crew and your 4-5
You wanted a piece but it's all mine
Got the drop from Sloth like it's war time
Get a box in your gob if you talk like
Don't wanna fucks with the kid, I'm like "alright"
Tell him "just wait till I come"
Used to walk with a pump, now I'm calling my mum like
"Yo, I'm on Radio 1"
That's MistaJam and that's Semtex
Sloth, Target and Cameo too
Now these niggas wanna try and come to my vids
For some pics and a cameo too
I'm like "where was you when I started?
Nah, where was you in '08?"
Like forget all the beef, man, I'm past it
I'm a grown man so I don't watch face, check it
Wait, nah
Put your money where your mouth is
I don't wanna talk bout them
How they gonna put money in my trousers?
Look, I ain't tryna get caught like them
My big bro's putting money into houses
You made all that dough just to go and buy clothes
And put your last money in your outfit
That's not real, little man, 'llow it
We stay trill, see me with the southers
Put down your gun, put down your knife
Let's have a fight, don't be a coward
Most of these badboys ain't got a heart, just a knife
And a scarf and they think they're about it
I'mma tell you like a man told me
If that boy there's weak, more time he's the loudest
Me, I stay quiet, wait for the riot
Fuck your deal, why the fuck should I sign it?
Hundred mill, get a plane and the pilot
Hundred mill, get a boat and the island
You can't come nicer than I can
And you can't rap tight, you're a hypeman
All I need is a mic and a mic stand
And a 16-bar, and I'll light man
Megaman flow, niggas don't like man
They wanna cat my style, they wanna fight man
They wanna put me away, they wanna life man
Shut down my show, me and my live band
Still I stand with my niggas on my right hand
Shoutout to K, that's one of my fam
Nigga, shut your face, you little sideman
They ask "who's the best?" I tell them I am
But wait, back to my next flow
Man are trying their best, man are dying to rap this show
Dying to rep flow
Leveled up, man, I'm slicing the threshold
Best know that whatever I said goes
I par with the best, this is bars in the flesh
Man, I'm dying to let go
Took a shot to your head with your dead flow
It's easy

[Instrumental 2]
It's time to fuck it up
Mr Money In The Bank, I feel to double up
My pagans get together and they huddle up
Like "Stormzy's going hard, we need to buckle up"
And I swear down I gave everyone a shot and now I'm
Looking at the clock like "call it off, I told em summer's up"
Everybody's talking some, I shut em up
Like "tell me, how's it feel to be a runner up?"
Dickhead, I'm still a problem and they still don't want it
Like "it ain't a banger as long as Stormzy's on it"
Like, I just get a beat and tell my story on it
I tell em "if it's time for beef then please don't call me for it"
Look, I'm steady searching whilst I kill a track
Like they thought they lost a culture, I'mma bring it back
Like they thought they lost a problem, I'mma bring him back
Like "how you rob the tings and then you bring it back?"
Like "how'd he write a verse and now he's singing on the hook?"
I tell em "I don't give a fuck, I feel to sing and rap"
And once you're finished with my flow, I beg you bring it back
And once I'm finished on the phone, I say "don't ring it back"
Check it, money is a major issue
That nigga Stormzy, he a major issue
Go so hard until you make them miss you
You can get the tears for free, you have to pay for tissue
And everybody's talking but there ain't an issue
And when you make a bit of progress, they can't wait to diss you
I'm like "ah well, that's some hating issues"
I'm like "ah well, at least my tape's official"
So I beg you 'llow me with your bummy arse
Look, I hit the club and do the Shmoney Dance
Look, I was real low up in my brother's yard
Now when I hit the road, they tell me that I'm coming hard
But you ain't got love for me, my brudda
Everybody's sending shots at me, my brudda
Are you bored?
Tryna send for me, are you sure?
Weren't you tryna start the beef, did you stall?
You tried to ride the wave, did you fall?
Nigga that's poor, look, you went and hit the ground running
When they ask me when it's dropping, I just tell them that it's coming but
The armed robbers are coming, hide your bands
He ain't even got a deal but they love him, I'm the man
But look, enough about me
Cause yeah, you know my cousin but my cousin's not me
So how you asking for a premium?
How you asking for a favour?
Come off my phone, I'll see you later
We're just tryna make a living
And I can tell that you're a hater
So there's no way you can be greater
Man, this shit is bad for business
I need a lair and some paper
Need a table and a waiter and a pastor and a bishop
And a spade for me to dig it
Cuh there ain't no one here to save you, fam
You're looking at the saviour
Grime ain't dead, your nigga brang it back
Get my wave on listening to Annie Mac
I hit Napa in my slippers and my fanny pack
In some Stan Smiths courtesy of Adidas
Your boy's coming, I ain't even got a manager
I phone Ims and tell her "put it in my calendar"
I'm the champ and I ain't chatting to no challengers
I feed on em, make me turn into a scavenger
Look, I squeeze on em, got me feeling like I'm undefeatable
I'm the one, you know the one that came and spun the remix
I'm the one, you know the one that came and done the features
Made your whole fans turn into some non-believers
But I came to the cypher and I cleaned up
Like, most your favourite rappers couldn't keep up
Like, if you've got a problem, nigga, speak up
Like, most my little niggas keep it G-ed up
G-ed up, fuck your mean look
Thinking bout them boxes that my Gs took
No fathers, we was living by the G book
This big black Ghana man got the scene shook
