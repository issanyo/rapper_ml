Radio 1 Live Lounge
Myself Stormzy
This is a glorious occasion
Yeah, check it

[Hook]
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
(Everything)

[Verse]
Yo, yeah, yo, they told me that by this time it would all be over
But I ain't running out of luck, I treat the game like poker
I know they put me on the poster just to match the quota
I'd rather be a Lionel Messi than a Frankie Zola
'Cause these old guys are washed and they're just getting older
And I ain't sending for the legends, that was for the cobras
Who move sour like I ain't been tryna spread the culture
And put my heart into this game like I'm some flipping donor
Days are getting dark, the nights are getting colder
And my city's getting worse, this stuff is getting vulgar
Pop a one Corona, Henny with some Coca Cola
Man, I was homeless I was sleeping in my dusty motor
But now we're always beefing with some bad promoters
Who tell us not to smoke on stage, but we're a bunch of smokers
For my fallen soldiers, rest in peace to Damilola
It's like I'm either very turnt or I'm just very sober
I'm either very gassed or I'm very reserved
I'm a wizard with the math, but I'm better with words
Say a prayer, then I watch all my enemies burn
Listening to Raleigh Ritchie or Melanie Burns
Mandem ask me for the help, then I send them a verse
A bunch of favors that will probably never return
And every medal on my shelf is a medal that I've earned
And I refuse to sign a deal on some terrible terms
That's why I'm unsigned, moving like I am signed
'Cause the mandem got their stuff together quick
And made a brand shine
And trying to make a speedy little flip, that's not the plan, guys
Put everything into my flipping graft and watch it backfire
God forbid I ever let a label run my life
So if I ever sign a deal, just know I done it right
A little rum and Sprite's boosting up my summer nights
Someone tell the DJ pull it back, a brother's coming nice
I pray I never ever lose the sight of things
It's not the major ones, it's more the minor things
'Cuh every time I make another rack
I know my brother's in the trap
And he's just waiting for his line to ring
And I'm supposed to be the one to bust the mandem
I hope my brothers know that I still love the mandem
It's just another day in the life
But I'd rather pay your mortgage than to pay for your flight
You feel me? You see, just imagine when we're 35
23 at the top, that's an early rise
With a model in the Hilton eating curly fries
Damn, what can I say, I lead a merky life
I was saving up my money just to buy a llama
'Cuh I refuse to be a victim in the hype and drama
Call me Mike Obama, messing with some higher karma
Smoking on dat, smoking on dat Maya Jama

[Hook]
(We on an ultralight beam)
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
(Everything)
Hear me out, yo
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
(Everything)
Radio 1 Live Lounge, yeah
We on an ultralight beam
(We on an ultralight beam)
This is a God dream
(This is a God dream)
This is everything
Everything, yeah

[Outro]
This is what it sounds like
When South London needs salvation (Yeah)
We refuse to compromise (Yeah)
We refuse to settle (Yeah)
This is a God dream
