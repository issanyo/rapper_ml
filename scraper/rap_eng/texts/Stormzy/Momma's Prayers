[Verse 1: JP Cooper]
Many things you pulled me through and I wouldn't even know
There's an army that walks with me when I step out on that road
You ask them every day to accompany me on my way
Woah, you never forget to ask, you got books full of prayers
That stacks, that stacks, that stacks

[Refrain: JP Cooper]
And if I fall, what if I fall?
These hands will catch it all
Mhhh, mhhh
And if I fall, what if I fall?
These hands will catch it all
Mhhh

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
Yo, them brothers came 'round to the block and tried to spray us
Demons of the night, they came alive and tried to slay us
While I was in my boxers, playing COD and San Andreas
I think I owe it all to mommy's prayers
I remember in December when they never tried to play us
And tryna hit the charts without the radio is chaos
Then mommy sat me down and told me they could never stray us
I charted, that was 'cause of mommy's prayers, yeah

[Chorus: Stormzy & JP Cooper]
I know I'll be just fine
This little light of mine
I know those hands will catch it all
Yes, I know that
I know I'll be just fine
This little light of mine, yeah

[Verse 3: JP Cooper]
I witnessed harshness, I've felt darkness in the night
Shadows may chase me down but your words keep them behind
You got me covered and I had no idea
You put your hands together and you dry up all of my tears

[Refrain: JP Cooper]
And if I fall, what if I fall?
These hands will catch it all
Mhhh, mhhh
And if I fall, what if I fall?
These hands will catch it all
Mhhh

[Verse 4: Stormzy]
Yo, bailiffs at my door because the council tried to play us
Then my mommy made a call and in the end, they had to pay us
I don't know how it worked but all I knew was we was way up
I'm guessing it was 'cause of mommy's prayers
I've been stabbed bare times but they couldn't see the chaos
Had a brother in the news, yeah, I see how they portray us
But when I have kids, and they ever disobey us
I'ma warn 'em about the power of their grandmother's prayers, yo

[Chorus: Stormzy & JP Cooper]
I know I'll be just fine
This little light of mine
I know those hands will catch it all
Yes, I know that
I know I'll be just fine
This little light of mine
I know those hands will catch it all
Yes, I know that

[Bridge: JP Cooper]
Momma's prayers they guide me
Momma's prayers they guide me
Momma's prayers they guide me
Momma's prayers they guide me
Momma's prayers they guide me
Momma's prayers they guide me
Momma's prayers they guide me
Momma's prayers

[Chorus: Stormzy & JP Cooper]
I know I'll be just fine
This little light of mine
I know those hands will catch it all
Yes, I know that
I know I'll be just fine
This little light of mine
I know those hands will catch it all
Yes, I know that
I know I'll be just fine
This little light of mine
I know those hands will catch it all
Yes, I know that
I know I'll be just fine
This little light of mine
I know those hands will catch it all
