[Intro: Tone]
All the haters, we just keep on moving
Yeah

[Hook: Tone]
Keep on
You can do it, fuck all the haters, we just keep on moving
This is my life, now it's more than music
So fuck all the haters, we just keep on moving

[Verse 1: Stormzy]
Look, feeling like Rocky on the steps, real talk
Come meet Rocky in the flesh
Round here, we don't do sorries or regrets
Round here, man'll catch a body for the bread
Yeah, the world's gone mad, seen a good girl turn bad
Saw a man get smoked for a bag
Saw a man get thrown in the back
Saw a man get rich then [?]
Got my bros in the trap, I don't want 'em dead
Niggas boasting their raps I don't wanna hear
Tryna blow from a track, I ain't stopping it
Put my bros on the map and get it popping here, yeah, it's proper, clear
It's all mad now, took a big step from the background
Had em boy there turn bad now
Me, I just air it
If it ain't God, how the fuck can I fear it?
I go hard all day, I'll go hard till it all pays off
I go hard for their life cause the grind's gotta pay
I go hard while the boys stay soft
I came round on the boys who could fuck with the wave
We're back where it all ticked off
I work hard, yeah, a nigga can't wait for the day
Where it pays and it all takes off, word
Staying on my grind till it works out
Tryna turn up while you turn down
Burn man's bridge, get burnt down
Like, how you gonna ask for a verse now?
Niggas can't wait till I burn out
Tell em be easy, I'm good
Do this for my bros in the pen
And my friends in the grave and the Gs in the hood

[Hook: Tone]

[Verse 2: Potter Payper]
Say my words be painting pictures like an artiste
Mr Essex Boy, certi from the Far East
I'm from where you could get a tug off some armed police
So I couldn't give a fuck about your RTs, darg
RT, I'm in a white house with some dark fiends
I feel sorry for them, honestly, my heart bleeds
But I'mma keep at it till I'm calm 'stige
To my watch face blue like it can't breathe
And HP's back, HP's back
And I'm rolling with some yat boys, get your AP snatched
I'm in that A3 black, darg, it's crazy in that Dunya
I'm Scar up in this bitch, them man Timon and Pumba
I get live, she hold it, sweating out like it's zumba
Call me Frankie, not Fraser, call me Frankie, not Butcher
Darg, I'm running through all that [?], pack on in my day, don
Theirs all stuck on that same one, G, we ain't smoking the same bud
