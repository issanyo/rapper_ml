[Chorus: Stormzy]
I said a prayer this morning
I prayed I will find a way
To another day
I was so afraid
Till you came and saved
You came and saved me

And the rain was pouring
'Cause the sun faded away
I’m in a better place
No longer afraid
Blinded by your grace
You came and saved me

[Verse 1: Wretch 32]
Amazing grace that saved the wretch
And now prayers all I got (saved the wretch)
Care is there
I say spades a spade
If you’re digging me or not
I’m a heal the world with words
You go heal a load of hurt
And I'm a write 'cause my Gods almighty

I asked for forgiveness
I sold my soul with my business
I sold it all, you’re my witness
I even brought in my siblings
Plus I aborted my kids, then
I hear their cries in the distance
That’s something I have to live with
Still I reply ‘I’m a Christian’
I repent, I repent
Sacrifice all my bread
Give my time up for lent
Every night say my prayers
Cause sometimes I forget
And I swear every time I shouldn’t
And cause of you I care every time I shouldn’t
But God made man in the light
Of his own image
So I shine bright by my woman
She my better side
And my suns like very bright
And my sky’s like heavens sight
And I drop down on both knees
And I raise my arms to exercise my
Love prayer, thug prayer
When I die, let me get a white dove prayer
If God’s working overtime
I shall not want unless I grind

[Chorus: Stormzy]
I said a prayer this morning
I prayed I will find a way
To another day
I was so afraid
Till you came and saved
You came and saved me

And the rain was pouring
'Cause the sun faded away
I’m in a better place
No longer afraid
Blinded by your grace
You came and saved me

Yeah
You saved me yeah
You came and saved me
Ohhh, ooh yeah
Yeahhh

[Verse 2: Stormzy, Aion Clarke]
I’m blinded by your grace
Every night and every day
And I was lost, yeah
But ever since you found me

I’m blinded by your grace
Through the darkness you came
And I’ll be alright
With you by my side

I can’t escape you
I can’t replace you
So don’t walk away from me now

Easy
