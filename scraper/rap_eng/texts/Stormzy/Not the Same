When you get too where I’m at
You gotta remind them what you fucking done
About all of the rappers that you fucking spun
So I went and made a song to tell you suck your mum
And when they start saying what they gonna do
You gotta remind them this is not the year
Did you boys not get the memo like it wasn’t clear?
How they put me in that cypher man, that wasn’t fair
I ain't  running through the six with my woes
I'm with the brothers
Adidas all down to my toes, in different colours
Fly your girl to one of my shows
She hold my luggage
Yeah I won that bitch because of the vote
She starts to [?] shut the fuck up
Everybody’s talking like they mash the work
Man are going to the trap then going back to church
Had a brother who acted like all the others
But he snaked me down the line
I stabbed him back because he stabbed me first
Word, everybodys talking about the mandem now
About all the fucking doors the mandems banging down
Can't chat about bangers, I'll write a banger now
Yeah I'm down for the clash and I'll phone up Jammer now
So simmer down, whiz around, used to have a pet
Miss me with the gimmicks I ain't tryna bag a cheque
Rapping all these lyrics but I used to wrap a zed
See I used to want them features now I want them rappers dead
