[Verse 1: Akala]
Yo, fire in the booth cypher, listen
Uh, Akala
Forget about walkin' in 'em
You couldn't put my shoes on
You ain't smart enough for me to wanna hear your views on
Freestyle, written or a new song
If I wanted bullshit, woulda just turned the news on
Man are fake as Jamaica's independence
I spit one sentence, put the Devil in repentance
Cause the flow's that vicious
Snitches, dumber than white people tryna call themselves niggas
Pigs kill our kids, you ain't seen
Love hip hop, don't know what hip hop means
Are you lean? Are you lean?
From the green, from the green
Never been signed but I've been the best in the scene
From when there was a platform, fire in the booth
For rappers to be judged how they actually rap
Who came top of the pack, it's a fact
I didn't have to pretend that I do sell crack
We've all got dogs that'd bust their strap
But I'm so old school, so down for a scrap
Your favourite rapper could get the Muay Thai elbow
Straight in his head top, sure you could tell though
I'm off 'round the world to lecture
A bag of universities, what did he say?
That I'd never finish college, let alone uni
I'm living proof that intelligence pays
That is not a metaphor, I meant that literally
My itinerary, swing by Italy
So we can all floss, we can all boss
Who runs companies, who does not
Never sold my soul, but we all got flows
And we all got shows, and we all got...
Matter of fact, we ain't all got flows
If they said you could rap, that was too much crow
Well I got more rhymes than the Chinese got dollars
You ain't get that line cause you're not scholars
So which emcee could touch mine?
Who done off the EDL guy with one line?
Look, bruv, we are not niggas
Like I did, you need a minute to go figure
For the mean time, I will deliver a little vigour
From the tongue trigger, that's a little dum-dum spitter
[??]
Then you realise your countries run by many similar
You little mimickers, my miniatures
You might score but you got no skill, Lineker
Sure I'll finish ya, vivider than a cinema
The way I paint a picture of words should be criminal
Who told you it's hard, it isn't, it's easy
It's bullshittin' to politicians
I'm a man on a mission, with a plan and a vision
I'd be damned if I didn't, so I abandoned resistance
H•A•M with the lyrics and I standardly kill it
Leavin' lookin' like, tryna get a tan when you're British
Told 'em all
All these little MCs, who do you think helped mould them all?
Now everybody wants to be independent
10 years ago, didn't I show them all

[Verse 2: Bella Gotti (No-Lay)]
Niggas looking at me like I snatched their bladder
Cause 24-7 I be takin' the piss
If the watch don't come off then I'm takin' your wrist
Put the white on scales like it snowed on a fish
Bitch, do you not know who it is?
Isabella Gotti, but you can call me miss
Big hips so I can't find jeans that'll fit
You don't like my shit, go and sit on the stick
Money, money, money, money, money
That's all I wanna talk about
Money, money, money
I blew the safe, then I hopped in
And my eyes went a different colour like Hopsin
My punchlines like cocaine boxing
I got so many bars around me like I'm locked in
You niggas wish you were time travellers
So you can go back and murder me before I realise
That I can kill a million guys, that want a million rhymes, with one fuckin' line
Money in my rucksack, money on my spine
Mummy I'll be fine  I'm about this life
Only God knows why
And my dogs know I am about this rhyme
My brain evicted me, I'm out of my mind
To keep me off your tongue, and out of your mouth
I put your man on smash, you put his head down south

[Verse 3: SafOne]
Yo, Ps for the weed, bring it out
Phones off, clingers out
Mandem on it, on road fling it out
Left jab, right hook, if you wanna swing it out
Like eff your shoe box, manna fill it out
Your [???] bring it out
Buy champagne and start spillin' out
My birthday, man coulda bought a house
But eff that I'm still in my yard sittin' down
Thinkin' how am I dawg, sittin' down?
Thinkin' how are my dawgs in the ground?
Thinkin' how is my arse still around?
But I'm outchea
Still talk of the town
Raw, nah I don't water it down
And I don't wanna hear no talk about war
Cuh I'm still walkin' around
Allow that, dangers, bring it out
Mask and gloves, bring 'em out
Swear, manna been doin' this ting
So it's rare that you're gonna see a man spin it out
Never that, bit a break, yeah down, fling it out
Look what's roundabout, skid it round
Man I'm ocean, probably bumpin' Drake's new ting
Real man, rollin' out

[Deadly]
Yo, bring 'em out, bring 'em out
Look whose fully eating dinner now
Don't chat to me 'bout iTunes
I'm like CD's man, fling em out, fling 'em out
Concerts man, fill 'em out, fill 'em out
We bring 'em out every time we been around
We lookin' over the grime scene grinnin' out
Makin' man know, listen
Yo, who said I would get left in the dark
I'm back with a vengeance like Rah
Turn up to get entrance and bark
Then you will hear engines and cars
Might see you main man slumped out like rah
Dead, you're gone too far
I will push back, then go trip, then laugh
Man chat shit, hold dick from shaft
Run this ting, don't think it's talk
Deadly will wait till dark, me you and strap can link in park
Minutes to midnight, blinkin' sparks
You will not turn up, if you're thinkin' smart
You'll be sprintin' fast
Stay blacked out like....Listen, there's levels

[Vesre 4: Stormzy]
Man try flex, man got me movin' like Ghetts
Like d-d-dead him on site, yeah dem man clap
They're doin' better in the trap
But we're doin' better in life, so fuck all raps
Kick off the door from the latch
Like it's easy to get up inside
Swear man, you old MCs need to leave it alone
Cause you're not gettin' better with time
Leave it to us, go look after your kids
I'll take over

Yo, yo, listen
From the top, from the top
Fire in the booth cypher
Myself Stormzy
Everyone inside
Yo, just warming up
Check it, look

Man try flex, man got me movin' like Ghetts
Like d-d-dead him on sight, yeah dem man clap
They're doin' better in the trap
But we're doin' better in life, so fuck all raps
Kick off the door from the latch
It's easy to get up inside
Swear man, you old MCs need to leave it alone
Cause you're not gettin' better with time
So leave it to us, go look after your kids
I'll take over from here
I made more movements than half of these pricks
And it didn't even take me a year
But a man try tell me to suck my mum I said
"Wait brutha, suck my who?"
Can't take big mic from some any old prick
Don't ask why I touched that yute, but
Anyway back to the rap ish
I brought dark skin back for the black kids
Big man like you gettin' catfished
One take for the verse and the ad-libs
Yeah, I used to be on the roads
Times I would freeze in the cold just to wait at the bus stop
So next time you talk about Skepta, Giggs or Wretch, don't forget about us lot word
Wait, nah, but I didn't really die though
This a part of the game, ideas all up in my brain like I walk with a light bulb
Man I came back with the flame
A pendant wrapped to my chain
And a beat on my iPhone, somebody passin' the game
List to the grime scene names
Do this with a blindfold, brutha it's easy
Huh, what you gonna try tell me?
Shit, I went back to the mountains
Look, and came back lookin' healthy
Fuck, man I'm sick in my head
Nobody can't help me
The love that you get for your songs
Shit, I get that for a selfie
Lord help me
Man are outrageous, somebody stop them
Needed a favour, tell 'em I got them
Bun all the haters, I do not watch them
I am the saviour, I am the problem
What you gonna chat 'bout now?
What you bothers gonna rap about now?
When you gonna stop bitin' my flow?
Why you brothers gotta cat my style?
Oi fuck this

[Verse 5: P Money]
I've had enough of your lyrics, all of your gimmicks
Your flow sounds tortured and timid
I got the game in the barrel cause I be aiming to kill it
Cover you quickly like what I spray is acrylic
Boom bang, both of you days in the mimic
Lame and you mimic
You rhymin' out of time with your lyrics
Dead or alive, better know you don't decide when I finish
[?] ain't real, it's a Type R, according to Civic's
So you all thought, actin' like you wanted to give it
Gimme the riddem, I rip it, and to my enemies stick it
I be playin' it smooth, and they be playin' it rigid
Ballin' out on my own, now they wanted to kick it
Showin' everybody flows, now they wishin' they bit it
Took a leap of faith, now you can tell when I ribbit
Boom, feelin' like a body shot when I rip it
The real talk the talk, but not one of them live it
Flow really fast, you're about to go on a trance
Feelin' like a phone bill when I run up a charge
See I call the ambulance, got a couple [?]
[??]
Kinda class, those already comin' to school, it comes in a car
Babe come in the car
Next minute, ahh, I made her cum in the car
Downin' that strong drink that don't come in a glass
Tellin' em it's goin' down when I'm up in the dance
She's lovin' the bars, the beats, says she's lovin' the cars
She give me a chance, you're not even given a pass
To give it to me, cause never do I muck up a task
Give it to me, why? Cause I'm one of the stars
Give it to me, why? Cause I'm one of the stars
Give it to me, why? Cause I'm one of the stars
And when I drop my tune they be like "Mother rah"

[Ghetts]
Back to back, I'm back to that
With a hat back and a MAC in lap
This is head top
Which one of these emcees should I head top?
Forehead, red dot
Soldier, 21 gun salute
At least you got a bad boy send off
Analyse the game, see where they went wrong
So I got covered, any angle they send from
Flows, where'd ya get them from?
Bars, where'd ya get them from?
Where the fuck's the respect gone?
I'll slap man out your sleep if I'm slept on
I'm on a level that they ain't ever stepped on
This is Ghetto, not Ghetts don
Speak up, where's ya chest gone
I'm at war in my heart with my chest strong
Im on my Jack Jones, and I feel like I'm ten strong
School more MCs than st bons
Ay, look, look

[Verse 6: Mic Righteous]
I only deal with certain people
I only deal with certain people
I only deal with certain people, people know
People know I'm from the coast and I give my people hope
From feeling broke, but other people seem to joke
Cause people's minds are smaller than their balls are so they need to boast
I don't think people know
The suffering my people go through
I don't think you people would believe me even if I showed you
If I showed you, if I showed you
Even though you felt some pain
Ain't to say there ain't no one out there that ain't felt the same
But fuck certain people, we don't work with egos
Every person's equal
And fuck certain people when they say they love you but they turn and leave you
And fuck the world it's evil
And every man for himself, I wanna help the people
These fat cats wanna kill the people
Steal from people, look at what they sell to people
Same old tricks and they still deceive you
It's hell for people, but I fail to free you
But we just as fucked, what the hell can we do?
Be selfish, dude that ain't healthy
I be tryna live healthy, watch my wellbeing
You wanna be like the wealthy people
Those Made in Chelsea people
Let hell freeze
Oh please, no fees for selfies
No self esteem
You still self loathe, self harm, watch yourself bleed
Been there myself, no self belief
There ain't nothin' you can tell me people
Got people I'm cool with
People I went school with
People that are bring the tool if I call 'em
Some be in England. some be in Scotland
My peeps are my people
Check this
No I shot this time, no my shit fucked and I might just light this blunt
From a festival to a fighting club
The best of all time, you ain't frightening us
Fat fuck, you ain't dieting much
Rap tough, you ain't writing much
Ah fuck, now look at what I've become
And now I just begun, retire your mum
I give an MC ten seconds to run like ten man, fuck
5, 4, 1, click clack clow
Sit back down, Alan Sugar ain't firing, fuck
I'mma just sit there and smile while you slimy fucks eat off my plate
This ain't Come Dine With Me blud
Rope round your feet wrapped round to a tree
Rope round your neck and it's tied to a truck, and the driver is drunk
You get the engine firing up, wheels spinning quicker than a vinyl spun by Preemo
And you can see your spinal tear
Am I all there? No, so you can spare me your final prayers, bro
Fuckin' this game, stickin' my dick in his ear hole
We weirdos we heroes, but we here ho
