[Verse 1: Solo 45]
Yeah
Rah
Alright, roll, roll, roll
Space between the cars, go, go, go
Some of us are dench yo
I don’t give a flying fuck
Pagans gotta go, go, go
Keep it on the low, low, low
Nosey bastards askin’ questions
Tell them niggas “I said so”

[Bridge: Solo 45]
Five guns, five grips, five guns, five grips
Five guns, five grips, five guns, five grips
Five guns, five grips, five guns, five grips
Spot any out-of-towners, switch ‘em off

[Hook: Solo 45]
Let the MAC ring, ring, ring, ring
Ring, ring, ring
Let it ring, ring, ring, ring
Ring, ring, ring
Let it ring, ring, ring, ring
Ring, ring, ring
Let it
Spot any out-of-towners
Switch ‘em off, let the MAC ring
