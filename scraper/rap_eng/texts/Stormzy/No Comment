[Intro]
Oi, MCs, yeah
Know their levels, yeah, haha
Know their levels, it ain't basic season right now
I swear to you
Look, look, look, look

[Verse 1: Bonkaz]
Fell asleep cutting paper, I woke up embarrassed
I pattern like we in Jamaica, I smoke from a chalice
Got cheese in my grater, I toke on my salads
I'll leave my estate when I'm ready
I've got a house in this ditch
From an ounce to a brick to a Bentley
I see my sis smile when I give her Giuseppes
Hear these niggas talking 'bout me
Like I ain't in the ends, like the boss Gary
Niggas say they heard a story 'bout me
All now, I couldn't tell you what the fuck happened
But I'd much rather murder the game with my brothers
They think they got it locked, man, they think they are hot
I will turn down your flame like the oven
I'll turn up on verses, they say that I'm bugging

[Pre-Hook: Avelino & Bonkaz]
She asked about US, I said I'm UK
Look at my neck, I'm Wretch 3 2 Chainz
Ask Bonkaz, I've been going bonkers
Fuck these niggas, ain't no issue, I'm a problem
Stunt on these bitches, now they pick me like some cotton
Asked me why I did the dirt, I wasn't living how I wanted
Me, I smoke weed, drink Dissy till I vomit
Catch a nigga slipping, go missing, no comment

[Hook: Avelino & Bonkaz]
Go missing, no comment, go missing, no comment
They're talking 'bout how I'm from it
They ain't know me, I'm on 'em
The ambition's iconic (the ambition's iconic)
Go missing, no comment, go missing, no comment
They're talking 'bout how I'm from it
They ain't know me, I'm on 'em
The ambition's iconic (the ambition's iconic)

[Verse 2: Avelino]
I just woke up to my dream
No sleep for time, ain't no time for no sleep
I've been grinding all week, just got rice and no peas
Mind was so low, I got high with no weed
They just confirmed I've got drive MOT
Now I'm just in Cavalli with Mo in Moschino
She said she a virgin, I sent her a vino
I'm no sex offender but I'mma get P doe
I grew up on Kano, oh Kano, tell your men to settle
Cuh my niggas rock bands with that heavy metal
Dot Cotton, man are next to kettles and shit
They say less is more but I've got pebbles and bits in abundance
You could never relate, I've got sisters and brothers
Hustlers, turned six into dozens
Fuck stripes, cause I'm feeling so I3
I ain't even on the block, the block cosigned me

[Pre-Hook: Avelino & Bonkaz]
She asked about US, I said I'm UK
Look at my neck, I'm Wretch 3 2 Chainz
Ask Bonkaz, I've been going bonkers
Fuck these niggas, ain't no issue, I'm a problem
Stunt on these bitches, now they pick me like some cotton
Asked me why I did the dirt, I wasn't living how I wanted
Me, I smoke weed, drink Dissy till I vomit
Catch a nigga slipping, go missing, no comment

[Hook: Avelino & Bonkaz]
Go missing, no comment, go missing, no comment
They're talking 'bout how I'm from it
They ain't know me, I'm on 'em
The ambition's iconic (the ambition's iconic)
Go missing, no comment, go missing, no comment
They're talking 'bout how I'm from it
They ain't know me, I'm on 'em
The ambition's iconic (the ambition's iconic)

[Verse 3: Stormzy]
They love to play games, but they ain't ever been a problem
Run and tell them that I'm on 'em
You can make the front page, with a picture and a column
Tell 'em that I ain't forgotten
Look, I ain't gonna say no more
All that chatting's out of fashion, nigga
We don't really take no talk
Mandem take the game by force, it's over
Man are talking, I can't hear 'em
I call Taylor come and link me up in Bicester
Niggas hate me cuh I'm fucking with the girls
But I never kiss and tell, I tell her come and take a picture
Look, niggas wanna see me fail but are always wishing well
Yeah, I learnt that from my sister
You're talking all that crud, I might grind a rapper up
Put that little dumb fuck in my Rizla, it's over

[Pre-Hook: Avelino & Bonkaz]
She asked about US, I said I'm UK
Look at my neck, I'm Wretch 3 2 Chainz
Ask Bonkaz, I've been going bonkers
