[Pre-Hook: Stormzy & Wretch 32]
Don't even talk too much
Don't let the dogs dem bark too much
A wise man told me you can never laugh too much
Let's kill em with success, let me be, our shoes up
Everybody down, everybody down, go

[Verse 1: Stormzy]
#MERKY, I signed to myself
#MERKY, I light up the world
Slide on my strip or slide in my kicks
I slide through your crib, then slide for your girl
All these man wanna fight for the belt
Swear man, I'm better off fighting myself
You ain't even got one prize on the shelf
Don't feel bad, you can find me for help, 32

[Verse 2: Wretch 32]
I feel like I kill it every other minute
How much times can I double digits?
I'm living in the sky, tryna find the limit
Cuh my money can't die, I can buy a living
Stray Doggz, so we find the bitches
Want me to eat out, tell her find a kitchen
Cuh there rough terrain inna dem kinda dishes
Cruising, I go Tom till the final mission

[Verse 3: Stormzy]
I was in Ghana eating stew
When I got a call from Wretch 32
He was like "rudeboy, keep on proving
Verse is done, it's season two"
I was on the roads from "P's & Q's"
I was making dough from trees and food
My niggas been cold, if you wanna be cold
Come to the ends, I can freeze em too

[Verse 4: Wretch 32]
Ain't too sweet when my beef gets stewed
Told Stormzy "don't leave no food"
If they're on our pitch and they try act up
Leave a man down like 3-4-2
Guess the selection's me or you
Clean up, Rolex sweep then move
Black on black riding, screaming "fuck Trident"
Never got my house keys from food

[Hook]
Everybody skank out, wile out, skank out, wile out
Everybody skank out, wile out, skank out, wile out
Everybody skank out, wile out, skank out, wile out
Everybody skank out, wile out, skank out, wile out

[Verse 5: Stormzy]
Switch up the ting when I bang out the flows
You can get bang out your clothes
Everybody talks real tough till they brang out the ghost
Everybody ran out the close
You can take the road out the man and the man out the road
But you'll never take the man out the soul
Oi, what you doing round here? Take your hand out your coat
You ain't gonna bang, you're a joke

[Verse 6: Wretch 32]
I talk out of turn, that's Tourette's on the beat
And I ain't got a X on, X on the beach
Vexed when they don't spread the bed properly
That's the last time you'll ever see a Wretch on the sheet
Come and dash with dem gyal dem regular
Don't need a baby mum, need a baby love
And I share the sharp gems what I'm making up
So I hope the taxman gets a papercut

[Bridge: Wretch 32]
Cuh when it's all said and done
Dem always wonder where we get it from
And we no need no evidence
Cuh police have the memory of an elephant round here
Round here
Play it back
