[Intro: Big 6ix]
Need new shoes on my feet
And my mummy need to eat
And my pops need some weed
So how the fuck am I asleep

[Verse 1: TE dness]
How am I supposed to sleep
And how am I supposed to keep my head up in these streets
I had to sky the coupe
Still got birds like its a coop
I gotta go and get it what am I supposed to do

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
I phone up 6ix I aks him "How's it soundin'?"
You ain't a gangster you just hang around 'em
My brother's counting paper he's still countin'
Yeah I'm the boss come link me up 10 Downin'

[Verse 3: Big 6ix]
Had a seat, I'm voting for it Labour
I got raided it was in my neighbours
I'm getting paper, getting paper
Blocks my restaurant I serve 'em like a waiter

[Verse 4: TE dness]
Way up
Only girl I ever loved was Nina
I'm searching for my shorty have you seen her?
I heard she creeping round the block but on the D-low
I heard she moved up in life now she a kilo

[Verse 5: Stormzy]
You're fucking with 6ix then you're fucking with me
You're fucking with Chris then you're fucking with T
She fuck me then leave, baby girl fucking  the team
I ain't buyin' her weed, I told her that nothin' is free

[Verse 6: Big 6ix]
I came a long way from the past with a few of my dawgs
Plans for a million I'm blowing dope out the view from the Shard
They claiming they heavy but they ain't comparing to us
I'm hearing the talk and I'm deadin'  to laugh
Can tolerate talk but I dare you to start

[Verse 7: TE dness]
I don't even like listening to them but I pause tracks bring it back listening again
You can tell them boys been listening to Ness
A bag of my tings while they sittin' on the net
A bag of bad talk while they sittin' on their ends
Shorty fuckin' with me now she shittin' on her ex
Hulk Hogan I start rippin' off a vest
Cross price for a Zed what I'm hittin' on a bench

[Verse 8: Stormzy]
Check one, check two can I make an announcement?
Shit's getting so crazy I need an accountant
I'm back on my shit, I just got back from the mountains
Had a talk with the gods, I took a sip from the fountain

[Verse 9: Big 6ix]
I need control of my life, the devil keep calling on me
Been in  bando two months, can't't put forty on me

[Verse 10: Stormzy]
Man talk shit 'til I get them, niggas only win when I let them
Might link my bro D from the Section
Summertime flexin' we flexin'

[Verse 11: TE dness]
Heart dark like my complexion
Rar-tar yeah that's my preference
Fast car dip through the West End
Since she met Stormz she ain't worry 'bout her ex men, no way
