[Hook: TE dness]
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?
Who's gonna comfort me? Tell me, who's gonna comfort me
When my back's against the wall?
I believed in promises before
And now I just need me a little more
Got my city on my back, girl, I'm a Stormtrooper
Ayy, if you ever feel under attack, I'll be your Stormtrooper
You need somewhere that you can relax, I'll open my door to ya
Me and you against the world, let's go to war
Girl, I'll help you through the storm
Ayy, I'll be your Stormtrooper
I'll be your Stormtrooper

[Bridge: Stormzy]
I think I need some intervention
I think you got the wrong impression
I need a hand to help me count my blessings
You always told me I ain't learnt my lesson
But ooh baby, baby, tell me why you keep on stressing
Girl, you ain't gotta stress no more
Ooh baby, can you feel my presence?
Girl, you ain't gotta stress no more
I'll be your Stormtrooper

[Verse: Stormzy]
I'll hold your hand for you
Don't let me hear that nigga put his hands on you
Girl, you gon' make me rise up, make me cancel all my plans for you
And if you can't stand up to him, just phone my phone cause I'll make that stand for you
How dare he, how dare he, tell him try that shit on me
Tell him try and pick on me, when I heard that news, man, it made me freeze
And I said forget all this, but how did it get like this?
Cuh girl, you were strong for me when I was awful weak
And I'm stressed and shit and I'm bugging out
You gave me all that I needed
And you helped me fight all my demons
That day when you held me tight when I was bleeding
I told you "wake me up if I'm dreaming", you said "babe, just keep on breathing"
I feel like I owe you this, and you just act like this is cool
And let him take you for some fool, with your back against the wall
Girl, I can't watch this shit, cuh when you're hurting and I'm hurting
And your burdens are my burdens, I'll grab a rope if that bridge is burning
Just let me help, just let me save you like how you helped me to save myself
Let me repay you and girl, you know that I'll do my best
To see you stable, put that halo back up on your head
My fallen angel, all the times you could've walked and left
Feel that I'm grateful, girl, all of the crazy things I said
That shit's disgraceful
If I could take it back, I'd give it all to ya, bring the world plus more to ya
All the stuff that I swore to ya, yours truly, your Stormtrooper

[Bridge: Stormzy]
I think I need some intervention
I think you got the wrong impression
I need a hand to help me count my blessings
You always told me I ain't learnt my lesson, but ooh baby

[Hook: TE dness]
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?

Ayy, if you ever feel under attack, I'll be your Stormtrooper
You need somewhere that you can relax, I'll open my door to ya

Girl, I'll help you through the storm
Ayy, I'll be your Stormtrooper
I'll be your Stormtrooper
