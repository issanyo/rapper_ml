[Part 1: Blinded by Your Grace Part 2]

[Chorus: Choir & Stormzy]
Lord, I've been broken
Although I'm not worthy
You fixed me, I'm blinded by your grace
You came and saved me
Lord, I've been broken
Although I'm not worthy
You fixed me, now I'm blinded by your grace
You came and saved me

[Verse: Choir & Stormzy]
I said a prayer this morning
I prayed I would find a way
To another day, I was so afraid
Till you came and saved, you came and saved me
And the rain was pouring, 'cause the sun faded away
Now I'm in a better place, no longer afraid
Blinded by your grace, you came and saved me, yeah

[Chorus: Choir & Stormzy]
Lord, I've been broken
Although I'm not worthy
You fixed me, I'm blinded by your grace
You came and saved me
Lord, I've been broken
Although I'm not worthy
You fixed me, now I'm blinded by your grace
You came and saved me

[Part 2]

[Verse: Stormzy]
Ain't here to talk Illuminati and chem trails
Here to close the show and make sure that it ends well
All my younger brothers looking fresher than Denzel
Still coming judging by the stuff that my friend sells
Well, all these stories that the tip of my pen tell
Yo, here I'ma let the tip of my pen shout
Like, "Yo, Theresa May, where's that money for Grenfell?
What, you thought we just forgot about Grenfell?"
You're criminals and you got the cheek to call us savages
You should do some jail time, you should pay some damages
We should burn your house down and see if you can manage this
MPs sniff coke, we just smoke a bit of cannabis
They'll get me for this so be woke
This year I'm dishing out L's and free smoke
They tell us that we're thugs, I try and bust the myth
But someone tell the Daily Mail they can suck my...
'Cause when I see Hus merking, I feel the vibe
I see my people on the telly, I feel alive
Jourdan Dunn up on them billboards, I feel the pride
And Daniel Kaluuya won a BAFTA, I could've cried
I fully ride 'cause royalty we are
You man are royalty, I need all of my royalties advanced
I got two sisters, one black mum, they raised a prince
Raised up by black girl magic, what did you think, huh?

[Part 3: Big for Your Boots]

[Interlude: Stormzy]
Alright, BRIT Awards 2018
Aye, South London in the building
Energy Crew

Go!

[Sample: Risse]
In your town to–
In your town to–
In your town to–
–night

[Chorus: Stormzy]
You're getting way too big for your boots
You're never too big for the boot
I've got the big size twelves on my feet
Your face ain't big for my boot
Skeng chat, kick up the yout
Man know that I kick up the yout
Dem boy dere tried twist up the truth
How dare you twist up the truth, look

[Verse: Stormzy]
Wanna come round here like a badboy? Do it
Bun all the talking, go on then, do it
Running through the party, bottle of Bacardi
Bro's in my ear saying "Stormz, don't!"
Devil on my shoulder, I don't lack
Hit 'em with a crowbar, I don't scrap
Even when I'm sober, I'm so gassed
You ride for this
What you talking 'bout?
Clown, stand down
Never had a MAC-10 or a trey pound
You were never bad then, you ain't bad now
Never had the MAC then, put it back down
Wait, I saw bare kicks, saw bare clothes
Said partner, can't wear those
Oh, BRIT Awards 2018, let's go, go!

[Chorus: Stormzy]
You're getting way too big for your boots
You're never too big for the boot
I've got the big size twelves on my feet
Your face ain't big for my boot
Skeng chat, kick up the yout
Man know that I kick up the yout
Dem boy dere tried twist up the truth
How dare you twist up the truth, look
You're getting way too big for your boots
You're never too big for the boot
I've got the big size twelves on my feet
Your face ain't big for my boot
Skeng chat, kick up the yout
Man know that I kick up the yout
Dem boy dere tried twist up the truth
How dare you twist up the truth, easy
