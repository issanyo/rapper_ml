[Verse 1: Paigey Cakey]
My time wasn't wasted
My karma's amazing
Send any more shots in my way
I may just take you out like we dating
Can't wait for the day to say "nigga, we made it"
Flow is amazing, chicks always hating
I am the one that the sisters are praising
That is the reason these bitches are crazy
It's crazy, they don't know me well
Well, my life's real
But this shit can feel like a fairytale
Tell em I'll never fail
I am the girl they all wanna be
I'll never fuck with them wannabes
'Nuff gyal wan' follow me
I'm on top of the world, where they wanna be

[Hook: Paigey Cakey x2]
I'm on top of the world, top of the world
We be on top of the world, top of the world
What would you do if [?]
Ayy, what would you do with a bank account like me?
Ayy, what would you do with a bank account-

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
I'm on top of the world (yeah?)
I'm on top of your girl (huh?)
She's sucking me hard (what?)
It was sloppy as hell
Might take your girl to the Shard for a meal
You man tryna go hard for a deal
Still on job, still calm in the field
Never gone soft [?]
Anyway, I get Cakey with Paige
Naw, I get Paigey with Cakey
Wait, that didn't make sense
Wait, no sorry I'm wavy
Look, 2014's been crazy
You man still stress [?] lazy
Used to go to my shows for the hoes
But now I roll up to my shows cah it pays me
