[Intro]
Hmm

[Verse]
I'm blinded by your grace
Every night, every day
And I was lost, yeah
But ever since you found me
I'm blinded by your grace
Through the darkness you came
And I'll be alright
With you by my side
The way that I see you
You're all that I'm needing
Your love never lets me down
Your love never leaves me, how?
And when I'm losing faith and there is nowhere left to turn
I pray you won't let me down
I pray you won't let me down
I'm blinded by your grace
Every night, every day
And I was lost, yeah
But ever since you found me
I'm blinded by your grace
Through the darkness you came
And I'll be alright
With you by my side
I can't escape you
I can't replace you
So don't walk away from me now

[Outro]
Oi, hahaha, that was it?
Yeah, yeah?
