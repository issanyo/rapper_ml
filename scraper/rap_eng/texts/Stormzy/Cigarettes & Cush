[Pre-Chorus: Lily Allen & Stormzy]
I'm sorry that I'm late and I missed your call
But you know night turn into day, I didn't stop to pause
I know I never see your face and baby, that's my fault
But I'ma fix all my mistakes, so don't stress no more

[Chorus: Lily Allen & Stormzy]
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush (Alright)
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush (Alright)
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush (Alright)
You don't ever let me down

[Verse 1: Stormzy]
You don't ever let me down
Got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
All those other girls just look
They ain't never takin' your crown
And girl, I know it gets on your nerves sometimes
When I don't answer my phone
And yeah, I double back on my words at times
But please don't start with that tone, 'cause girl
I love you, you know, but I can't be there
But when I get home, just roll my weed, yeah
What's mine is yours, give you space to breathe here
Just weed and cush, that's a major key here
Yeah, then you play me a song
Smokin' smoke 'til we're wavy and gone
Come home from a long hard day with the dons
Like where's my baby? I'm sorry it's been long

[Pre-Chorus: Lily Allen & Stormzy]
I'm sorry that I'm late and I missed your call
But you know night turn into day, I didn't stop to pause
I know I never see your face and baby, that's my fault
But I'ma fix all my mistakes, so don't stress no more

[Chorus: Lily Allen & Stormzy]
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
As much as you think you're alone in the way that you feel
I come home every day wondering what is real
Between us, ground so far beneath us, sometimes I can't read ya
But it don't mean I won't treat ya
To a blunt full of that reefer
We may get in fights but I could never see me leavin'
Somethin' 'bout how close the high can bring us
Sober just don't please us
If you're wondering, yeah, I'm still here because I see us
But Mary makes it easy to talk to you
Aww, yeah, 'cause sometimes I just can't spill my thoughts to you (I took you in every day)
At the end of every day I belong to you (Belong to you)
I'll still pass the bong to you
I'll write a song to you
I'll do no wrong to you

[Pre-Chorus: Lily Allen, Stormzy & Kehlani]
I'm sorry that I'm late and I missed your call
But you know night turn into day, I didn't stop to pause
I know I never see your face and baby, that's my fault
But I'ma fix all my mistakes, so don't stress no more

[Chorus: Lily Allen, Stormzy & Kehlani]
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
You got those cigarettes and cush
You don't ever let me down
I promise

[Bridge: Stormzy & Kehlani]
You don't ever let me down
I won't ever let you down
'Cause you don't ever let me down
I won't ever let you down
'Cause you don't ever let me down
I can't ever let you down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

[Verse 3: Stormzy]
It's been like a month now since you left my side
Got me smokin' a blunt now, but there ain't no vibe
'Cause I fucked up badly, all I did was push
And there's no more weed, no more cush
And I'm deep in the south side, and I can't find love
I was lookin' for my brown skin, tryna find that buzz
Now what have you done, Stormz? Now what have you caused?
And we weren't just brethrens, we were so much more
Girl, you was my hero, the beat to my heart
And them tears on your face, man, they tear me apart
Man, I just wanna fix you, fix what I broke
No cuddles on the sofa, no more smoke
And I pray God saves you, man I pray all night
I just wanna say thank you, 'cause you saved my life
But I cut you deep, and I know how it looks
Now there's no more weed, no more cush
No more cush

[Outro]
No more cush, yeah
Now there's no more cush
No more cush
