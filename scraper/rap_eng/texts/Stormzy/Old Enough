[Hook]
I'm old enough to know better
But young enough to be reckless
These birds telling me I'm fly as fuck
But I ain't covered in feathers
I'm a natural born hustler
£50 notes in a cluster
Look, I can sell fire in hell
Fuck it, I can sell pork to a rasta
I'm old enough to know better
But young enough to be reckless
These birds telling me I'm fly as fuck
But I ain't covered in feathers
I'm a natural born hustler
£50 notes in a cluster
Look, I can sell fire in hell
Fuck it, I can sell pork to a rasta

[Verse 1: SeeJay100]
I'm on this boasy ting, you can't stop me
She wants the bone cause I'm cocky
She told me that shit turns her on
So I beat the pussy up rocky
Now she telling everybody
She the brown sugar to my coffee
That's only cuh she seen me with a stack
Last week, she didn't wanna touch me
Now she wants to chill and get comfy
Told her "fuck me, feed me, don't love me"
I've got 5, 4, 3, 2 gyal on my line
Never said you're the one, don't watch me
Three bags on my wrist
Two bags in my pocket
Now that's what you call having a bubble
Look, pop me

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
I'm not rich enough to buy yards
But I'm calm enough to get by
If you're old enough to talk crud
Then you're not young enough to get [?]
I'm too slim for all of that gym stuff
But I'm big enough to rep mine
I'm too cool for all of this hood shit
But I'm good enough to get signed, right?
Gone through all of this madness
But I'm young enough to get mad
Man keep talking all of that badness
I'll be jumping out of that cab
Yeah
I'll be jumping out with that shh
I'll be jumping out with my Gs
Then man will be spazzing out like I'm frass

[Verse 3: Smithy]
I see them vultures watching man on
I'm at the bar, I'm spending on bags
When I'm on the road, I'm rolling in cabs
From New Cross to Brixton picking up bags
[?] JB live and Dem Two
Up in Westfield popping off tags
And I've got a big [?] for them sideman
Cuh I see them moving like crabs
Bruv, I'm certified in my bits
Young enough to rave hard
But old enough to send couple young Gs
To run up all in your yard
See, I ain't on the long talkage
Can't catch me out like a cheater
Anyway, I'm out, ring off the ting in your ear
Like BlackBerry speakers, cause I'm

[Verse 4: Cadet]
Me, I'm old enough to know better
But I'm young enough to be reckless
I be taking pics with my boo
Not my wifey, talking my necklace
[?] of my crow
Then we'll knock you out, I've got heathers
I'll be in the hood, I be down and rough
Got cold, my herbal come with an essence
Who? Me? C-A-D?
Nigga better have my song on repeat
I'm original and I'm me
Like I'm tryna press on retweet
This ain't [?]
So there ain't no way you're stepping on me
I was on her man, she gave me brain
See baby, why you stressing on me?
