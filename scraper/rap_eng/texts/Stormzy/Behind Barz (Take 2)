[Verse]
I've got the word online like 'Bro it's your time, go write for your Link Up'
The last time I lacked it was mad so now we come strapped to the drink ups
And it ain't no badboy ting man, I do that for my own safety
So stop tryna find what pays me nigga, I do this daily
Everybody's bad now, everybody bust gun man it gets so confusing
Man-a-man please, like me, how can I be scared of a human?
Why should I be scared of a next man, just 'cause he thinks that he's bad now
When most of these new school G's some old school nerds that crept from the background
Nigga fuck your rep, fuck your team and this whole road ting is a shambles
Somebody tell these fuckboys Summer '14 got cancelled
'Cause this year I'm going on cold, go get your coats and your beanies
Man spend years getting dissed in school then they go uni and turn greazy
That don't make sense man, everybody's tryna live calm and man are going backwards
Look man, I'm so damn tired of you actors, man get ready for the rapture
It's the return of the beast, it's the return of the problem
And I still wouldn't save these hoes even if I had a cape and a costume
You can't educate me about licking out moves, man I robbed yards with my olders
I climbed through the window, grabbed the P3, tell my bro 'Could you grab the controllers?'
Back when the girls tried diss me 'cause I never had no gwop for my train
Same girls that I drive past, tryna get a lift so their weave don't soak in the rain
Forget that life, earned my stripes, could you please judge me by my talent
I'm tryna get a yard like Wilf, and I'm tryna get a whip like Callum
You niggas just rich online man, you niggas just rich on Insta
I grind 'til the daylight come, see your playtime's done, nigga I'm Miss Finster
Look, still go ride for my brothers
Only time I trip's when I fly with my luggage
Mum needs a whip then I tell her it's nothing
Tell her that shit's coming out of my budget
[?] got knicked, man I had feds in my crib tryna search through my drawers and my cupboard
Don't talk shit, talk about burn my bridge, look I don't even talk to my cousin
Mad, mad how I crept up, came with some next stuff
Yeah I'm just giving man a heads up
Krept said I'm next up, Tef said I'm next up, man it feels good to be next up
Man it feels good to be this good, Stormzy's cold but he's unsigned
I feel like Skeppy on Westwood, don't make me swear on my mum's life
And these niggas still talking crud, please correct the vibe that you came on
When you was getting banged in your face, I was out on the strip with my chain on
So let's not forget where we came from, no, let's not forget where we started
'Cause my boy just bought a new printer and it came with a beam and a cartridge
Man got me talking in code about things that I don't promote
I don't say a word about smoke but if you know then you know
Yeah nigga, I do my job and I'm still comfy on my ones
And you can't bump me, are you dumb? I tell a fuckboy 'I'm not the one'
See I can do what they're doing but I swear they can't do what I do
Man asked if my niggas been on things, I said you will find out when they find you
And we're all tryna be good people, it don't work but at least that we try to
I can't wait 'til it's real and I'm sitting with a deal like '[?] which one should I sign to?'
Old school, back on the estate, lock the whole thing off with a rifle
My [?] boys still call me Big Mike, got the pengtings calling me Michael
Gun shot for all of my rivals, tryna be gwop can't work for survival
Who God blessed, no man can curse no man on Earth, that's word to my bible
Yo, straight anti
Came back on my job like Ramsay
I don't want you niggas near me
Broke niggas make me angry
Broke niggas make me nervous
Man talk shit about burners
Man talk shit on the Insta
But we see through the surface
Yo, don't even talk too much
