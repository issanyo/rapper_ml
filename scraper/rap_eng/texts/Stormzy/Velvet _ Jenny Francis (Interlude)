[Intro: Stormzy]
Yeah, alright, yeah

[Verse 1: Stormzy]
Yo, you just wanna know what it feels like
You don't know what you want but it feels right
And you ain't even my girl but we still tight
All your man took you 'dam, aw sick, that's nang
Let me put you on a real flight
Yeah, welcome to the trill life
That views in The Shard then I go and book a car
Then we go and get a meal life
You're tryna look into my soul and see the real Mike
I got a long-term plan, I'm a long-term man
I'm just tryna get the deal right
But my issue is pride
If I ever told you I missed you, I lied
Screaming at my phone like, "I wish you would try"
Poison love, if I kiss you, I die
You get mad, get pissed and you cry
Then you making one wish and send a kiss to the sky
I can't lie, man, I wish you were mine
But the truth is, I ain't got the tissue or time

[Pre-Hook]
I can show you my dirty little secrets
Promise me you're always gonna keep it, girl
Tell me that you love me, you're the sweetest
I didn't want to love you but I beat it, girl
I grow fonder, girl, I grow fonder
I grow fonder, girl, I grow fonder

[Hook: NAO]
A touch of the wind and it's gone
I wish I could help it
Into my window of calm
Want only to take the flame
To the bridge of dawn
It feels just like velvet
A touch of the wind and it's gone
Ooo, then it's gone

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
So how would you feel if a brother stayed around?
Taking care of you and not the other way around
Fell too deep, now we're both six feet
Baby, I can barely breathe, could you suffocate me now?
I don't wanna sell a dream you can't afford
I can take you 'round the city when you're bored
Maybe when you finish your degree, we'll go abroad
Your ex-man never gave you nothing, he's a fraud
Can you tell me what it feels like? (Tell me what it feels like)
Tell me what it feels like
Welcome to the sweet life
Baby, welcome to the sweet life
Look, hanging up the phone on me, girl, you're too bright
You got a hold on me, girl, you're too tight
We can go from Paris to Rome in two nights
If I'm gonna do it then I gotta do it right, alright
I will never ever lead you astray (Ay!)
That's all I never needed to say (Ay!)
The boys wanna tease at my faith (Ay!)
That's just another reason to pray (Ay!)
And if you ever needed me to stay (Ay!)
I'll always be a phone call away (Ay!)
Breathtaking, I'll blow you away
Girl, just face it, I know how you stay (Woo!)
If I tell you my every little interest
Thinking of you every time I rinse this, girl
But loving you is easier, the simplest
Running through the world, you're my princess, girl
I grow fonder, girl, I grow fonder
I grow fonder, girl, I grow fonder

[Hook: NAO]
A touch of the wind and it's gone
I wish I could help it
Into my window of calm
Want only to take the flame
To the bridge of dawn
It feels just like velvet
A touch of the wind and it's gone
Ooo then it's gone

[Verse 3: Stormzy]
Yeah, alright, alright, alright, alright
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Man thought that Stormzy couldn't sing, haha
Yo, it feels just like velvet
A touch of the wind and it's gone
I wish I could help it
Into my window of calm
Want only to take the flame
To the bridge of dawn
It feels just like velvet
A touch of the wind and it's gone
Ooo, then it's gone, then it's gone
Then it's gone, ooo then it's gone
A touch of the wind and it's gone
Ooo, then it's gone

[Outro: Jenny Francis]
Oh yeah, I definitely loved that one
That was Stormzy, with the smoochy "Velvet"
On #Merky FM
I'm Jenny Francis, hope you're well
Right! It's time for another
Here's "Mr. Skeng", crank it up, sit on it
And let it move ya
