[Hook: Konan]
If she ain't fucking, she got to go
Tell her 'don't waste my time'
Police want to stop me, search my clothes
Tell em 'don't waste my time'
If it ain't money I ain't involved
Tell em 'don't waste my time'
Wasteman waffling down my phone
Tell em 'don’t waste my time' (nah nah nah)
Tell em don’t waste my time (kaboom)
Tell em don’t waste my time (oh yeah)
Tell em don’t waste my time (nah)
Tell em don’t waste my time (nah nah nah)
Tell em don’t waste my time (kaboom)
Tell em don’t waste my time (behave)
Tell em don’t waste my time (dah)
Tell em don’t waste my time (nah nah nah)

[Verse 1: Bonkaz]
Tell a nigga don't waste my time
And tell a bitch don't waste my time either
I wear skinny jeans, size 30 waist
But I've still got space for my niner
And I can make an album in like 30 days
And that'd still get played cause I'm deeper
I got a double cup of that purple pain
I [?] you know Azalea, work
Spinning through the city with my feet up
Black girl whizzing in the Mini, got some D cups
They be acting silly till they see me, then they speed up
If I back the milli then you Siri, you gon' speak up
I made guns on the road off a package and Os
Now I left the streets, I'm on a mill
I got a chick in my ear while I'm drinking [?]
I'm like rest in peace to Uncle Phil, word

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
Why the fuck you go and get me on the remix?
Man, you niggas so stupid
Got like all of my niggas on the feature
Kill my brother? Look, I didn't wanna do this
Look, man, I tell em don't waste my time
Man, I've been a problem nigga, rate my grind
Got the whole ends on my back, it's mad, Brad told me
Mind I don't break my spine
Told her be out of the house by the morning
Niggas just talking? Look, that's not important
Been the best rapper my age for a minute
Please don't compare me to 'Tastic or Torment
Don't get it twisted, them man there are cold
But look, what's the top 3 if my name's not involved?
Niggas my children, ask the last rapper, I killed them
I pray the lord blesses his soul

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Swift]
'Nuff peng tings man get
All the dead tings haffi dead
Plus I got a humpy with a big nose
Hope a nigga try take my line
Bro got the 44 in the two-door
Told the jakes don't pull this ride
Leave his 110s on the floor
Push that marrow up high
Sad nigga stabbed me with a sword
I ain't looking for him with a knife
I love all my pagans, they love me
I love all my cousins and aunties
Deepee, my brother, my dargy
Touch him, I touch you, wallahi
In the trap I was kinda far-ish
Got like so dark like Wally

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Youngs Teflon]
If she ain't ucking, she got to go
Tell her don't blaze my line
Youngers wanna bang but they don't know [?]
Tell em don't waste my nine
Barbers waffling while they trimming
Tell em don't shade my line
I've got young boys catting for a lick right now
Might tell em go take that shine
Pussy arse niggas get left [?]
Bill more upfront like [?], keep a physi on-site
Dirty like Sprite
Keep selling girls dreams, they only see me at night
Most of you rappers are fussies
Used to [?]
More time we're mental, still catch me with my ki
Chick had my [?]
