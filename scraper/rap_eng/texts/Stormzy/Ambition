[Verse 1: Raye]
In August, I'm staring at rain clouds
A descendant of London
I watch as people are falling like rain
Encouraged to seek other options
I don't need other options
You either eat it or you spit it out
You're either silent or you run your mouth
You breathe in or you breathe out
I'm so cold but the sun's up
Like it's winter all year, oh
So welcome you to it now
Oh, wait, that was my sound
Could you dig it up or sweat it out?
Could you give it up and sit down?
But after that, I hope you know your place
Cause you just gave me the damn crown

[Chorus: Raye]
And I'm gonna wear it proud
Watch me as I wear it now
I'mma ride this money like a wave
This money like a wave, this money like a wave

[Bridge: Raye]
Now I made it this far, but this far ain't nothing
If we're talking ambition, I think you should know that I don't wanna settle for nothing
I wanna know that I got myself
I wanna ride my money like a wave
My money like a wave, my money like a wave, yeah

[Verse 2: Raye]
I want the future, I want the best view
I'd like to buy all my day ones a house too
Collie, Ben, Jodie, I got you
I've got a list of everything I would do
Make that dumb guy regret what he did do
Then he'll be calling up my phone like "I miss you"
Then I'll be like "haha, you can go now
Cause you didn't wanna know when I told you
I'm gonna make something of my life"
Believe that, yeah babe
I've got God, he is on my side
And I'm a child of '97 so I plan to be on time
And I'm ahead of this game
Yes, I were meant for this life, oh

[Chorus: Raye]
And I'm gonna wear it proud
Watch me as I wear it now
I'mma ride this money like a wave
This money like a wave, this money like a wave

[Verse 3: Stormzy]
You know I only phone back
If I know that it's the money calling
Tell 'em bitches "do not phone back
I am in the studio recording"
Mummy, listen when I'm talking
Mummy, listen, it's important
I wasn't gonna tell you, but I thought I'd let you know
That I just got us both a mortgage
Now it's top floor with these fancy reservations
I don't even like it, I'm just here for observations
Tryna tell the difference from my people and my pagans
Cuh' the last time that I slipped, I had a sticky situation
I will never slip again, you can put that on my savings
They wait for me to fall, I keep on waiting
This feeling is amazing, how's it feel to hate the kid
But deep inside, you know you rate him? Man, that shit must be frustrating

[Chorus: Raye]
And I'm gonna wear it proud
Watch me as I wear it now
I'mma ride this money like a wave
This money like a wave, this money like a wave

[Bridge: Raye]
Now I made it this far, but this far ain't nothing
If we're talking ambition, I think you should know that I don't wanna settle for nothing
I wanna know that I got myself
I wanna ride my money like a wave
My money like a wave, my money like a wave, yeah

[Outro: Raye]
Now I made it this far, but this far ain't nothing
If we're talking ambition, I think you should know that I don't wanna settle for nothing
