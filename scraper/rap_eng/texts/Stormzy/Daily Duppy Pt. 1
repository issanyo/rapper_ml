Hunger in my belly got me gunning for 'em
Someone go and tell 'em that I'm coming for 'em
Yeah bro, I'm the leader of the new school
They're looking at the new kid like everybody's running from him
Everybody's scared now, everybody's shook
Everybody's turnt down, everybody looks
They wanna downplay my achievements
But please, let's not try and stunt like everybody could
Look man, I put in the work, rate me a little
I was doing shows for the perks, pay me a little
Little piggy wants to get hurt, stay in the middle
When you bruddas never put in the dirt, you're playing the fiddle
Wanna talk about grinding? You wanna talk about grafting?
Cool, let's talk about that then
Young boy spraying like a MAC-10, reminiscing back when
Niggas went and had me on the back bench
I do whatever feels right, hear these rappers talking
I'm just thinking I could kill you when I feel like
Hit 'em with that real life, I say what I want
Real talk, everybody wants to kill Mike
Cause right now I'm looking like a belly
Tell them niggas shut up man, I'll do it when I'm ready
Tell them niggas 'llow me, I ain't coming out my house
Yeah, them streets was cold but it's colder in the south
Do you know who you're 'bout?
Trust me, I'm humble till I grab the mic
And trust me, I'm calm until I hit the stage
Cuh I can keep it cool when all the man dem's hyped
But when it comes to music, I don't fucking play
Cuh if my mummy loses, then it's my fault
And you thought this was easy? That's what I thought
But everything that glitters ain't gold
And most these niggas ain't your bros
Trust me, fam, I know, shit seems real but it never is
Talk about a life that you'll never live
Every week, man, I have to restart
But it's like they confuse my clean heart for begging it
But that says a lot about you
Tells me that you might've had some trouble as a yout
It's like these niggas hate me cuh there's nothing left to do
But cuzzy I ain't stressing, I am comfy, I'm the truth
They've just got a point to prove, niggas so weak
If all these niggas street, why you niggas just tweet?
If all these niggas sheep then I'm Little Bo Peep
Coming through with something if you niggas so street
But you're washed niggas, get up on your job, nigga
