[Verse 1: Stormzy]
Here's your L, hold it
Roll one, light one, smoke it
Man wanna ask "what's the problem?"
I'm the problem, now solve it
Big money in my hand and fold it
Had a big boy strap but I sold it
Niggas wanna talk about progress
Two cigarettes and a bottle of Volvic
Whoa, Storm's gone cold
Mic in my right hand, no, I don't choke
Don't say a word if you wasn't involved
Yeah, it's all funny till I see him on the roads
Like "wah gwan, Stormz? Wah gwan, bro?
Know it's all cool, know it's all jokes"
Tell a man fuck that, you know the code
Round here man chat shit, get smoked
Man wanna talk about bodying who?
Rudeboy, man's more squaddy than you
Link up Mez and the Nottingham goons
Crew one two, it's the Nottingham crew
Know EZ and Rodigan too
New Year's Eve, I was at the O2
2016, just see what I do
#Merky coming near you

[Hook: Mez]
Not a bad guy like Lex Luther
Don't make beats like I'm Lex Luger
You don't wanna chat shit on the computer
Getting sucked in like a Dyson hoover
Tell a man if he wanna buck me
Code is on my back like internet router
Wanna be a G? Wanna be a shooter?
Better get a strap, better get a Ruger
Not a bad guy like Lex Luther
Don't make beats like I'm Lex Luger
You don't wanna chat shit on the computer
Getting sucked in like a Dyson hoover
Tell a man if he wanna buck me
Code is on my back like internet router
Wanna be a G? Wanna be a shooter?
Better get a strap, better get a Ruger

[Verse 2: Mez]
Wanna chat shit on the computer?
Wanna be a popstar and a rockstar?
When I seen him in life and not the computer
I thought he was an imposter
Wanna be a G? Wanna be a top dog?
Go get grades, try and be a doctor
Did a couple show when I got ripped off
[?] put me on the roster
Wanna clash me cuh you wanna be someone
That ain't gonna make you into no one
I'm the original like King Kong
You're just a likkle man like Diddy Kong
You're a dickhead, ain't even Donkey Kong
I got a couple lyrics to take you, my son
Dates? I don't wanna do that, cuh
That's very long, I'm a lyrically dan and don
And my arms ain't strong, but I still play ball
Like say my name was David Armstrong
If you wanna be a badman, go get a gun
You're a black man [?], that's long
Man can't diss any one of my sons
Or my nephews, cause I'll start killing everyone
Man are looking at me like "what's going on?"
Man are looking at me like "Mez, you're a don"

Not a bad guy like Lex Luther
Don't make beats like I'm Lex Luger
You don't wanna chat shit on the computer
Getting sucked in like a Dyson hoover
Tell a man if he wanna buck me
Code is on my back like internet router
Wanna be a G? Wanna be a shooter?
Better get a strap, better get a Ruger
Not a bad guy like Lex Luther
Don't make beats like I'm Lex Luger
You don't wanna chat shit on the computer
Getting sucked in like a Dyson hoover
Tell a man if he wanna buck me

Better get a strap, better get a Ruger
