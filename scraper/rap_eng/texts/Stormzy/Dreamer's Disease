[Intro]
I don't even smoke no more but somehow I stay high
I don't even smoke no more but somehow I stay high
I don't even smoke no more but somehow I stay high
I don't even smoke no more

[Hook]
Look, I don't even smoke no more but somehow I stay high
Quit my job, mum bugged out, made my choice, this is my life
And I swear down I can't do this alone, may the dear lord be my guide
We've done some things, wouldn't even know where to begin but the dear lord knows we tried, so it's alright
Look, I don't even smoke no more but somehow I stay high
Quit my job, mum bugged out, made my choice, this is my life
And I swear down I can't do this alone, may the dear lord be my guide
We've done some things, wouldn't even know where to begin but the dear lord knows we tried, so it's alright

[Verse 1]
Like, where do I start?
Most of these man weren't here from the start
Stay for the sun, disappear in the dark
Stay clued up and stay clear of the sharks
Shoutout [?] who was there in the park
Said this year man are clearing the charts
All these girls shed tears on my heart
Tryna find one that don't care for my past
Still no bites, just bearing em bark
That's why I'm still not hearing em talk
When I hit a lick then I share it with Mark
I'mma be the one take care of my dargs
Summer '010 was there in my yard
Them times there, yeah, my hearing was hard
Snakes in the clique, there was bare in the grass
Can I get the mic, man? I'm raring to start
Heart's too big and it beats too loud
Jump on the stage, go and do me proud
Don't you ever let em see you down
Don't you ever let em take your crown
Give a fuck if they're easily pleased
Thank God I've got a reason to breathe
Suddenly I get weak on my knees
Think I've got the dreamer's disease
And this shit's gonna kill me
Yeah, this shit's gonna kill me
Damn

[Verse 2]
Yeah, this shit's gonna kill me
All these sleepless nights and these cheap-arse flights
It's mad, my nigga, do you feel me?
Been through a lot but I'm sure that I'm still me
Well, maybe I'm not but it comes with a cost
I just hope it's the real me
I can't wait till they six-figure deal me
Dreamer's disease, man, I think that I caught it
Sold me the dream and I went and I bought it
I can't even afford it
Should've payed safe, put it straight to my mortgage
It's too late now, can't-can't turn back
Time's one thing that you can't turn back
So please listen to the words I rap
There's been vision every verse I spat
Heart's too big and it beats too loud
Don't you ever let em see you down
Don't you ever let em see you down
Don't you ever let em see you down
They say that we dream too big
They say that we've lost our minds
They say we've got the dreamer's disease
And I tell em that keeps me alive

[Bridge]
If I fall before I fly
I just pray my dreams can save me, if I lose it all before I die
If I fall before I fly
I just pray my dreams can save me, if I lose it all before I die
(Yeah, I think we got the dreamer's disease)
