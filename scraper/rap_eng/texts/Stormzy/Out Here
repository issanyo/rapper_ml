I know some boys who kill for that Lizzy
We just tryna stay busy rotating them pinkies
And my blessings go round but go 365, blowing trees to the sky
They happy I made it, I'm happy I'm out here alive
I wanna drown in the deep end, bad mind, we don't need them
We celebrate on the weekend, turning up on the weekend
My blessings go round 365, blowing trees to the sky
They happy I made it, I'm happy I'm out here alive

[Verse 1: Stormzy]
Look, it's been a long time coming but I'm blessed now
I spent a long time running, let me rest now
You told me I can't but your words mean nothing, I'm the best now
I gave you a chance and a way to advance but you never played your part, what a letdown
Now you got me looking to the sky like I need ya, now I'm whizzing through the other side like a seeker
Never had a day off or the time for a breather, who the fuck said I was an underachiever?
I done this, I do this, whether drum stick or acoustic, I put my own funds into music
They load up the gun then they shoot it, and if you don't run then you're stupid

[Verse 2: Tanika]
Why you looking me up and down when nigga, this ain't a stripper show
You're waste and that's as low as my knickers go
Fuck the bully, in school I never run
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout the days I put my hair up in a bun
Back when shit was all fun, then I signed a deal
But then we lost our house and the shit got real
I'm so numb to the pain I can't fucking feel, I can barely feel
Ayo, so pardon me if you don't know what I'm about
No Leona but I'm bleeding out
Bitches be fake, everything you see around me's real
So please, bitch, weave it out
Believe me now, I'm talking 'bout the days we used to starve in South
You got food? Better feed the drought
Cause them tugs come shooting out
Screaming "fuck a drought", believe me now
