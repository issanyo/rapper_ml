[Hook: Harry James]
I should have listened to my mother
She told me think before you speak
You better run for cover
When your head is hiding from the police
Now look at what I started
Lord I beg your pardon
I need to leave this secret garden
They say home is where the heart is
Home is where the heart is

[Verse 1: Devlin]
Life's crazy now! I'm asking how many of my friends got babies now
Life ain't waiting around for no man it won't slow down it just speeds up that's when I freeze up
And I think of the future do I want daughters do I need sons
In this messed up world do I need love
Need drink, do I need skunk
To elevate me like fiends, fuck!
Jim you think too deep cuz
Yeah I know it and I hate my brain cos it never can go with the grain
This life's an enigma straight
No peace 'til I rest in peace


[Hook - Harry James]
I should have listened to my mother
She told me think before you speak
You better run for cover
When your head is hiding from the police
Now look at what I started
Lord I beg your pardon
I need to leave this secret garden
They say home is where the heart is


[Verse 2: Devlin]
I've seen a lot of lights flash
Done well for a white trash kid that dwelled in the timelapse
Vibing to 90s rap in my night cap tryna bring time back
Whys that? I don't really know but I worked on impulse
Writing tracks all about where my life's at
I never knew I'd be a live act many years later
When you're breaking through they all rate you
But when you make the cut they all hate you
Now I'm isolated I'm a stranger
Anywhere I go I'm in danger cos there's always gonna be a hater
What's life about? Will I find out later


[Hook - Harry James]
I should have listened to my mother
She told me think before you speak
You better run for cover
When your head is hiding from the police
Now look at what I started
Lord I beg your pardon
I need to leave this secret garden
They say home is where the heart is
Home is where the heart is

[Verse 3: Devlin]
When the music dies and I'm obsolete I'll spit my rhymes on a somber beat
Wave bye-bye like Dom McClean fly through time in a quantum leap
Witness life from a godly seat observing those that were lost like me
Explorers lost at sea when the siren seems so sweet
It's enchanting 'til you don't know who you are and your fate's advancing
Look around you're getting older now and still wasting chances
Raised in carnage now I feel like Bane in darkness
But I'm still dancing to an unknown beat with the speakers blasting

[Hook: Harry James]
I should have listened to my mother
She told me think before you speak
You better run for cover
When your head is hiding from the police
Now look at what I started
Lord I beg your pardon
I need to leave this secret garden
They say home is where the heart is
Home is where the heart is
