Shot City, D-V-Z, OutTakers
Big up Shotter

[Verse 1]

I'm the grimiest spitter than you've ever seen
Flourishing whatever the season so say that i'm forever green
OT, a heavy team and the Movement too stay the better than who's the crew
We can arrange a date, I kill your whole career in one statement
Arrange your fate, I raise the stakes
And blaze the papes so play your place
Break in your place and I'll take your weight and (??)
Won't hear me chatting shit i'm on straight lyricism, my bars are destructive
So I don't care how long you've been here and what you've accomplished
You look lost like you're in the woods with no pumpers hunting
Prey I don't bury ya, now you're the prey i'm the predator
You can spit whatever you want i'll still bury ya
See me on my hustle on the courts all day like Federa
Wanna say that your an opponent then know that you leave doors open
For Devilz to murk you, i'm Destiny's Child but not Kelly Rowland
Everything i'm selling is stolen
And nower days, MC's chat so much shit that I think silence is golden
Apart from when Devilz is spitting, i'm gripping the mic in a tight lock til their submitting
Here I'm hitting the nail on the head, can't run like you got let down by your legs
Everyday there's a thousand arrests
Your man hung around with the feds and tell them when a shotter invents
But i'd never spit information, no matter the situation
You and the feds have got a friendship like me and the mic
I check my boys on road while you're chilling at the station
Me and Shotz, some grimey individuals
Smooth criminals when I'm spitting out the lyricals
I bring my bars to life so you can touch them in the visible
And realise that life full of ridicule
Me and Shotz on the cold blocks
So what if he shot rocks
Spit fire like a bullet when the Glock pops
I won't stop til the day I pull up in a drop top
With a couple of the lads and a couple of zutes, a couple of slags
More than a couple of grand in black bags
I'm talking major figures, if you form an orderly line and keep them coming
And one by one I will happily keep on blazing spitters
This ain't a test of me, when my backs on the wall you'll see the best of me
Making heads turn like the century
