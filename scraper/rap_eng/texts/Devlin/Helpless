[Verse 1: Wretch 32]
Uh, I'm practically being fearless, be thankful that you can hear this
I'm a godfather, I'm happy to meet the parents
How can I be generic
When my generic's from a line of people chained to the ground that got the furthest?
The fuck's man telling me? I run my pedigree
I rap, I'mma Run DMC my legacy
Niggas should've had that KFC man's recipe
'Stead we're eating bargain buckets, getting fed a dream
I'm eating it though
My kind of kettle's full of steam and it's gold
For me to prove a point, I need some people to poke
Got an open field mind but I'm keeping it closed, that's how we feel on the roads
I'm fed up of getting shell-shocked from bombs that didn't hit me
You gotta either give a shit or give a kidney
Give your life, you better deliver like Whitney
This is suicide, nigga, do you do or die with me, huh?
From my estate, we got Baff who makes it happen
Got Z who's taking over, got me who made it rapping
Got Jobi, captain of Reading
So tell me, where are you heading?
Niggas who don't follow their minds should get beheaded
You should go for it, I might pay for ya
You're renowned for always recording, I got a chain for ya
Take you out your bed in the morning, I'm tryna pray for ya
Nigga, I ain't made it, I'm making it for the slave in us

[Hook: Rebecca Garton/Varren Wade]
I don't wanna be helpless
Help me to help you
Helpless
That life won't do
Helpless
Help me to help you
Help me to help us
In God we trust, oh ah

[Verse 2: Devlin]
Every single race on this planet has seen the pain
And hardships of life, it's time we make a change
My boys are running lines while my lines run the game
I don't trust in no god, I put my faith in James
The kid that made it happen, from walking round in Dagenham
On my Jack, until the eve would come then I'll be Adam
In fact, my dreams were always there, I had to grab 'em
Your life will take shape if you manipulate the patterns
I'm relaying facts, passing you the baton
Now sprint until you drop, you'll be somewhere near the top
This grind'll never stop and you can't unwind the clock
Are you hungry? Are you not? Well, let's rewrite the plot
These haters love to watch, and love to see you flop
Cause their own lives are broke, in the house or on the block
And just cause you want more, they look at you like a snob
Well fuck 'em, try and find your way and leave 'em lost
But love 'em, cause hate will only help exhale the flames
Give me the mic, I'm Christ, it's time I rise again
I've seen my whole life here in eerie Indiana
And seen my blind faith when times seemed strange, cause
From my estate we got Jay from Inbetweeners
Charlie spinning records up at Kiss FM at breakfast
And there's me, and not forgetting Mitchell round the corner
I guess there must be something in the water, tryna make a scene

[Hook: Rebecca Garton/Varren Wade]
I don't wanna be helpless
Help me to help you
Helpless
That life won't do
Helpless
Help me to help you
Help me to help us
In God we trust, oh ah

[Verse 3: Swiss]
Uh, look, yo, look, rewrote the fate of the hood, So Solid
Cause everybody was chasing the drug game before us
If they had ghetto papers then we'd be the road scholars
Every chapter and page, wouldn't need you to go college
Instead of behind bars and sentences, no commas
We showed the ghetto master with letters, could roll commas
Made the hood marketable, we gave it with no polish
The mere fact we ran the city without no Boris
Or Ken Livingstone blocks, splitting stone rocks
From a little old cotch, made Britain's roads hot
With a little weed from a BT phone box
To selling millions of Pusha T tees, oh god
Lord knows, I don't even know why we bought cars for
So fly, driving license was a passport
If you weren't sure about chasing your dreams
After hearing this, when you wake up in the morning, go back to sleep
Let's talk Battersea, let's talk mind state
G mega carton as partners, hustler's mindstate
Only Love blew up, took it to the United States
Shabs fucking with the Roc now, [?] Jay
Mr Carter pain, the music was the Blueprint
Fathered a lot of rappers though I happen to have two kids
You never got an abortion, I wasn't planned, Mum
Your boy just wanna ball like a kid that never had one

[Hook: Rebecca Garton/Varren Wade]
I don't wanna be helpless
Help me to help you
Helpless
That life won't do
Helpless
Help me to help you
Help me to help us
In God we trust, oh ah
