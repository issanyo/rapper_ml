[Verse 1: Wiley]
We're gonna take it one step further
On the riddim committing murder
Man in my city mandem have heard of
I'm around like a burger, the kids draw for the burner
And burn ya because they're sick of being learners
Sick of being heard of cause of the music that I don't do
Fuck about on the pitch, I'm gonna roast you
Cause I got the skill of a winner, I'm gonna boast too
If it was '82 I would have torched you
I'm hopeful, hopefully developing
And I be the only king that gets Devil in
And I'm doubling, I'm trebling, I'm better than I've ever been
The revolution is over and I'm about to settle in
I've already been a nice kid, an Ice Kid
And then an ice man, that's why it's hard we're forgetting him
We've gotta take it up level and beyond
I'm a rebel on a song, take off cause I'm relevant

[Hook: Wiley]
We gotta take it that one
Step further
Step further
Step further
We gotta take it that one
Step further
Step further
Step further

[Verse 2: Ghetts]
This ain't the level you reach overnight
Are you ready for this?
Lancelot's when I bury the king
I said, sorry, pardon! What?
Oh my God, it's a regular spin!
Bet any given I'll be better than him
Fuckboy, you can't level with the level I bring
I'm a P-R-O-B-L-E-M
I'm a demi-god with the devil within
I said bullet if you wan' push it
So man ah salt and pepper your skin
Too many wannabe Kendrick Lamars
Sendin' them bars, but Ghetts did it before Kendrick
And I offended plenty of stars
I can make fear enter your heart, I'm relentless
Can't say grime's dead to a grime head
I am more the original mic-man times 10

[Hook: Wiley]
We gotta take it that one
Step further
Step further
Step further
We gotta take it that one
Step further
Step further
Step further

[Verse 3: Ice Kid]
I just wanna smile again
Stifle them with the rhymes again
I'mma rhyme till death
Are you mad to think I'm content with the life of stress
I've got bars, I'm on a Rikers Island ting
And I think it's time to find the life within
Better mind, I'll put my knife inside your hip
All the niggas by my side, I'll die for them
I'll go blind on the right riddim
Rise up into the sky cause I fly like a pilot is
You couldn't [?]
They wanna see me die before my time begins
Bright like a diamond ring
Go and jump on the riddim and I ride like a cyclist
Sore loser but I like to win
They don't shine cuh the light in their mind's too dim

[Hook: Wiley]
We gotta take it that one
Step further
Step further
Step further
We gotta take it that one
Step further
Step further
Step further

[Verse 4: Tre Mission]
Tight grip on the strings of the hoodie when I come through
Never said a bar that was untrue
But you see me come through Lord of the Mics
And leave with a duppy, I was there on my ones too
What's new? I'm in the sunship, nigga, check 1-2
I take control of a Z like undo
You see the goons on deck? I was one too
Looking at the stick like "this is what it's come to"
And my niggas still walk with the ting
So get down, let me see the dargs dem come through
You ain't hear the big boys man ah run through
Screaming out spar when your girl got run through
I've got bolts in my skull that's unscrewed
I've got beef on the plate that's unchewed
And told them already, I'mma tell them again
Cause I'm picking up sticks, that's one too

[Hook: Wiley]
We gotta take it that one
Step further
Step further
Step further
We gotta take it that one
Step further
Step further
Step further

[Verse 5: Devlin]
One step in the right direction
I fantasise of big knifes at night
And slicing up One Direction
A killer on the loose
I'm blamed for the white complexion
Is that far enough?
I ain't here through luck, I'm here by election
Wanna try it? Then I'm raring up
I'll start tearing up your whole rhyming section
I'm gonna go too far
I'll get myself drunk at my local bar
But tell your girlfriend I'm a local star
Be sick on her skirt then literally blurt
I'll go further than that
I've already got sperm in the bank
In case this generation rises after I die
And they wanna spit dirt on a lad

[Hook: Wiley]
We gotta take it that one
Step further
Step further
Step further
We gotta take it that one
Step further
