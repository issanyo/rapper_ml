[Verse 1: Kano]
Look, I’m top selected, you’re not respected
Not affected by any MC with an ego
We won’t eat for breakfast
To be top 3, gotta meet the checklist
At least two CDs in the shop (check)
Channel U, Base, Kiss and Box (check)
Three classic underground songs (check)
Merk any MC on the spot (check)
Nigga I’m top 3 selected
Flows are innovative, beats are hectic
Been the best in the underground
But the overground now I got respect in
Not interested in half of them kids
You sound like D and do what Ghetts did
Nigga, this is my full tape
That’s why that gold plaque's hanging up in my hallway
Not investing
Any more time in rhymes I done wrote
And you remixed it
Yeah nigga, I’m representing
London town, yeah it's domestic
No muscle but still hold weight
Nigga I love the jobs you hate
I spray that shit
Record it, you play that shit
And be like fuck, Kano did it again
That they must take a million men
To cop my CD, went from HMV
Straight to the niggas in HMP
G, everyone knows I’m top 3
I’m probably 2 or 1
And if you don’t agree, they gotta be phony or dumb
Cause I been on top since Romeo dunn

[Verse 2: Scorcher]
I'm back with a vengeance
I'm here in the class of '07, I'm back in attendance
You niggas better head back for the entrance
The underground's mine
I can go mainstream too, I got a handsome resemblance
To my cousin Sin
For those who don't know Whitey, I fuck with them
But back to the best flow
I'mma deliver you the crack from the get-go
Check the wordplay
The content, the concept
And I ain't breaking a sweat yet
I'm established out here
And I ain't even a vet yet
I'mma do this like Jason or Ghetts it
And I'm gone like say I'm on a runway
Make big beats on a Saturday
Oscars spray em on a Sunday
Lord wanna play em on a Monday
Press the button with the bomb
When I'm on that stage my little brother's not on
And I put T straight on from the day that I got on
I'm CV, no way I've forgotten
Cause I still got love for my old friends
And I still sell drugs in my old ends
Couple of niggas have got MySpaces talking shit
But it's not nuttin', I fold them

[Hook: Ghetts]
Top 3 selected, six MCs
So you know three have gotta be rejected
Who's gonna be elected?
It's so close, let the road talk
Top 3 selected, six MCs
So you know three have gotta be rejected
Who's gonna be elected?
It's so close, let the road talk

[Verse 3: Devlin]
Who would've expected top 3 selected?
I'm septic, need the whole scene disinfected
Electives will ruin your collectives
Watch like detectives, I'll show you a reckless perspective
Due to years of being unsigned, neglected
While these other MCs get big?
I don't believe in that so I'm a skeptic
A hectic diabetic, not an epileptic
Another notch on my climb to the top
Left them at the bottom on the rocks
Rolled past, now my boys wanna shot in on your blocks
Yutes can't hold it up like an old man's willy when it flops
You silly little cocks, know that it's top 3
Straight out the top drawer, I could get hot
Like a mealy when it pops
They could get dropped like Beckham from the squad
And they reckon that they're gods
With a constant cannabis-smoking criminal nature
Love my party but hate Labour
Cause of when they tax and degrade ya
Till you're bank-robbed with no paper
And then you wanna start doing robberies
Until you get on top of the economy
And then take your [?] away on holiday
These mugs don't bother me, I'm used to controversy
And these guys just can't deny quality

[Verse 4: Wretch 32]
Without a spliff, star, I'm the best with the rhymes
I'm destined to shine
I even got cats investing in lines
So when I pressed my mixtape
I should've got charged with intent to supply
I move CDs, I can jet, star
It's my intention to fly
You can't take off with your bait songs
Look, I'm capital O Original
I'm the man with the flow that's lyrical
I'm top 3 selected
Niggas keep getting their top seat rejected
They did not meet the Wretch list
I ain't gonna say I'm the best
Learn From My Mixtape, just saving my breath
And if you don't get Ps when you see me
The least you can do is pay me respect
Or play me on sets, look
I'm top 10 dead or alive
You're not Wretch nor poetic or fly
God said "who's better with lines?"
They were like "Docherty", honestly
Look, I've been through two so one I've gotta be
I'm Wretch, yeah

[Verse 5: Durrty Goodz]
Look, you write bars I think 'em in the head
Sync 'em on a riddim deliver 'em on a regs
Follow my gen and bare awkward [?] what I said and you
Act feminine like women up in the bed

[Verse 6: Ghetts]
