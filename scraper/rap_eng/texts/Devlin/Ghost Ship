[Verse 1]
Welcome to my ghost ship
The one I resurrected like the Black Pearl
And had it stay afloat in
And from the day I boarded on this vessel
I feel as though I've done a lap of every single ocean
And the seven seas too, but I got the wind on my sails and a good crew
Of men who grew up in the same neighborhood I knew
And I will turn to sail to where the sky's forever blue
Along the way I learned of lives I never knew
And I can't shut my mouth, who am I to hide the truth
But really, who am I, just a navigator
Guided by the north star and now my time is due
I'll keep floating down the river till you see a pale figure roll up saying how'd you do
I'm like Columbus with the compass
So let me move

[Hook]
I've been rowing down the river so long
And I don't even know where I belong
It's hard to find the right life in this song
It's like my head feels tired but my heart's still strong
As life goes on, the river takes me different places
The fight goes on
This ship's lowering it's anchors
Cause I've been rolling down this river so long
So long, so long, I've been rolling down this river so long
So long, so long, I've been rolling down this river so long
So long, so long, I've been rolling down this river so long
So long, so long, I've been rolling down this river so long

[Verse 2]
I started in a raft, I made into a craft
Then I was gone at the rasing of the mast
I've seen pain behind my craft
Cross paths and I see your ship alike like the Cutty Sark
In the woods where the pirates throw
In the water where the pirates dwell
I never justify the odds I defied myself
I said I'll never make this, horrible scenario, shape shift, yeah
And all my crews got a few stars like a Orion's Belt
We make the pilgrimage here upon a river full of tears that were taken from lost souls
Left to cry in hell, a cry for help
Is what this started as, but now my life's sick like the psychotic pitbull it's barking mad
How I came from nothing, now I control the water ways your barge is banned

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My mum gave birth south of the Thames
Then I float down to this ghost town, now I call my ends
Where a county starts and the city ends
And I learned to be careful when you're picking friends
Between the few men we had to build a boat
Lie it low, just to keep the dream afloat
A lot of people thought that it was washed up
Hence the reason why they looked like they've seen a ghost
Call me Brook, call me Black Beard or Davy Jones
One captain that will send your whole navy home
And I will never rest with my skeleton
Therefore it's relevant you'll never call me lazy bones
So welcome to my ghost ship
That has promised me the one day it'll free my soul
So when the tide comes in upon the beat you know who knows
You know you might get to read my scrolls

[Hook]
