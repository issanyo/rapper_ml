One, I've been here for a period of time
So long that my brain has gone delirious inside
I think back on all the years that I've survived
Holding back the tears that keep appearing in my eyes
But now I'm yesterday's news
And I'm tomorrow's promise
I've got my mince pies open wide
Trying to visualize devils in disguise
Devz I'm like Picasso
'Cause I've been through every shade of blue
I'm walking under rainy skies but the flame never died
It stayed alive 'cause I was made to ignite
Like dynamite I'm from the cold November night
I'm riding tight, notice flows slip and slide
Like a tire in the snow 'cause there ain't no grip on ice
I'm cold in the Moscow and it's minus 29
So welcome to my life, I've cleverly designed minds
Lost souls just trying to live the higher life
I've been here so long
Through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here
With the government and yesterday's news
I've been here so long
Through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here
With the government and yesterday's news
Devlin, I'm dangerous, I'm dead guys
And every week forgotten like yesterday's headlines
I've been through the blues just like Elvis's best time
But I ain't wearing suede shoes, I've just got the best rhymes
I refuse to die, you could attempt to kill me twenty times
But I'll still rise like I'm the day walker Wesley Snipes
So let me stick my teeth into the game and bleed it dry
When I witness blood seeking through his veins
This has become apparent
I've got a talent that these other rappers haven't
So what would be the point of bloody keeping it in chains
I'm not sure what you think about [Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible] can't speak to me sane
So cut the conversation 'cause I've been lower rating
Taking anything I'm pleasing taking off the aviation
To a better place in time
Better for leaving this place behind
I've been here so long
Through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here
With the government and yesterday's news
I've been here so long
Through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here
With the government and yesterday's news
I can't see no reason why I can't retain success
I just need a real good time away from all this stress
I can't see no reason why I can't retain success
I just need a real good time away from all this stress
I've been here so long
Through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here
With the government and yesterday's news
I've been here so long
Through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here
With the government and yesterday's news
