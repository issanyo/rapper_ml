[Hook: Etta Bond]
Love's not on the cards
No time to mend a broken heart
No knocking down this wall
I told you when it started, I don't do broken hearted

[Verse 1: Devlin]
Don't talk about love silly, you don't love Jimmy!
This ain't a game girl and I ain't the king of hearts
I'm trying to say love's not on the cards
Can't hold hands, I ain't into romance
But if you wanted I could take you to my yard
Treat you like a bad girl, tell me what you are
I'll have you spinning like the fan belt, you won't know where you are
Call me sirius, you're riding with a star
Scrap that I ain't a star I'm just spaced out
And to be honest we could use a bit of space now
Always said that I wouldn't be there tomorrow
Bet your bottom dollar I’ll be gone before the day's out
Anyway, you couldn't love me if you tried
I'm lovely on the surface but uglier inside
Cause if I had ten mil, and my name was Raymond Weil
I still wouldn't have the money or the time

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Devlin]
I don't think you're listening to Etta Bond
Don't get emotional
Call me Voldemort, a bad wizard I just want to give a witch a wand
All this early hour small talk is getting long
You wanna fight?
Take a pipe-bomb to Lebanon!
You want love?
Come closer and get them leggings off!
But tell me that you love me then I'm jetting off
Time to cut the ride short, driver let me off
Cause if you never saw me on the stage
You'd ignore me in the rave
Level with me straight, I'm a 10, you're an 8
And now it's getting rather late
Don't be offended because I'm blunt like James
I ain't trying to make your heart break
Just accelerate your heart rate while you say my name
And I'm sorry but I seem to have forgotten yours
Remind me, is it Janet or Jane?

[Hook]

[Interlude: Devlin (Etta Bond)]
(We’ve done this before, I gave you my life [continuous])
You can't lock down the heart in my chest
I'm too young to have a cardiac arrest
'til my dreams come true I can't rest
Cupid can't scar my flesh
Love's not on the cards I guess

[Hook x2]
