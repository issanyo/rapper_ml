[Verse 1]
I've been away for a while 'cause shit weren't sweet like Tate and Lyle
I held it together with the fakest smile
But they rate my style, when men that I thought were tight moved on
I couldn't give them what they want
With a heart compiled of hatred, how the fuck can you be my dog?
Left alive and lost in the ice and frost, too many of my wires got crossed
Then I fell into my comfort zone, smoking trees that literally looked like logs
When the fans ask 'Where's Devs gone?'
Taking a slut to a fancy restaurant
When I should have been headstrong
To then feel stepped on, life's harsh

[Bridge 1]
What you think you're doing?
Running around like some idiot
Need to start focusing, you've been wasting time

[Hook]
The devil inside of me
The side you just don't see
I've been fighting, who? Me
It felt like amazing grace
I was blind, now I see

[Verse 2]
Wanna know where I've been? Me too
It's a blur of booze and birds
Wake up with a hand all bruised and I ain't got a clue what occurred
I've been the prick too long, going on like I don't care about the career I tailored
From the stone and bricks in Satan's lair
But life will take you there when you get robbed of a relative
And when I drive by your old flat, I blow a kiss and reminisce
I can't write inside this pad, I'm more pissed than I've ever been
So I try to escape this curse, tryna run from the devil in

[Bridge 2]
Come on brother
You made this man
I think the game needs this bruv
This is all you fucking know
Need to get up man

[Hook]
The devil inside of me
The side you just don't see
I've been fighting, who? Me
It felt like amazing grace
I was blind, now I see

[Verse 3]
I wake up on the sofa with a sore head in my friends house
No cash in my wallet, I know that I'm back in the ends now
Factories, flats and vomit
Every house looks run down
Screw-face and I'm on it, I ain't hard like onyx
But lost it, where's the anti-psychotics?
I'm falling apart but the streets ask
When's the album dropping?
When this writers' block subsides and I feel like writing again about topics
Until then I just crawl inside my shell and it feels so horrid

[Hook]
The devil inside of me
The side you just don't see
I said I've been fighting, who? Me
It felt like amazing grace
I was blind, now I see, now I see
