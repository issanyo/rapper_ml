Yeah, it's Tales From The Crypt
Somebody needs to come and take me away I swear
I'm waiting, I've got my passport and everything
Big up Ratchet, it's Devz

[Verse 1]

Something inside ain't right, I can't describe what it's like
I hold my knife tight as at night, looking over my shoulder
Is this me for the rest of my life?
Cause every time I open the paper or watch the news
Somebody's been stabbed and killed
Yeah it's time that we have to chill
Britains like NY was in the eighties and that's for real
Cause everybody wants to slash your grill
Kick doors off, run up in your house and brandish steel
Cause they think that it makes them real
But at the end of the day whats real?
Nobody's born a thug so is the transformation forced on us?
No one wants to be took for a prick
These man have got sticks that they're forced to pop

[Hook]

Somebody take me away because something doesn't feel right
It feels like music was meant to be but these roads weren't meant for me
So i'm screaming take me
Somebody take me away because something doesn't feel right
It feels like music was meant to be but these roads weren't meant for me
So i'm screaming take me

[Verse 2]

Some days me and Unique just roll out the bits
And each of us roll up a spliff and drive to the sticks in a whip
Where one day I hope to live and where the kids ain't holding shivs
All I wanna do is stack high, I don't wanna be a bad guy
I just wanna slide to the franchise so I can slip from the bits before me and my mans die
And that day that my Nan died, God took a part of me, ripped out the heart of me
I feel the shivers so that's how I know she's looking after me
And me and Fakes man felt it, church (???)
Cold shivers and tears in our eyes so we know that she loves you from the other side
My friend for life so don't cry

[Hook]

Somebody take me away because something doesn't feel right
It feels like music was meant to be but these roads weren't meant for me
So i'm screaming take me
Somebody take me away because something doesn't feel right
It feels like music was meant to be but these roads weren't meant for me
So i'm screaming take me

[Verse 3]

Let me talk about life, bad enough at the best of times
I need somewhere peaceful to go life the rest of mine
I'm stuck behind enemy lines, there's no saviour
You can pray but the lord won't save ya
The ultimate maker, he placed us here
And now the whole worlds doomed cause of human behaviour
People destroy nature
So if I go through it'll only be on my own two
I'll take the position of hero, blow up and give a better life to my whole crew
And then I'll come and laugh in your ear hole
Cause all I see is shanks and ballies
Little kids getting stabbed in allies
Them scumbags robbed my Nanny
It brings a tear to my eye, people don't care in these times

[Hook]

Somebody take me away because something doesn't feel right
It feels like music was meant to be but these roads weren't meant for me
So i'm screaming take me
Somebody take me away because something doesn't feel right
It feels like music was meant to be but these roads weren't meant for me
So i'm screaming take me

[Verse 4]

Take me away from these Nam streets
A one way ticket to paradise
Girls on a calm beach, cocktails and the palm trees
I'll be way out of harms reach
With a Lexus sign on the car keys, wake up keep wishing
I feel encaged and imprisoned
Even though I kill opposition, in any division they don't listen
So where's the credit i'm due?
I'm wasting away, I'll be a skeleton soon
Important that I start selling these tunes
If not then It's back to the road selling food
And I don't want that, I just wanna blow
But there's one thing I gotta know
Will I ever get over these roads, I don't know
But I'd duck it for my Mother to go with no questions

[Hook]

Somebody take me away because something doesn't feel right
It feels like music was meant to be but these roads weren't meant for me
So i'm screaming take me
Somebody take me away because something doesn't feel right
It feels like music was meant to be but these roads weren't meant for me
So i'm screaming take me away
