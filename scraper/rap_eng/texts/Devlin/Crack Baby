[Verse 1]
When I was young, I knew this kid
And his life was always madness
His mum was on them crack rocks
When he was young, his Dad left
Kids would call him 'have-not'
And worse, I bet you can guess
Scummy, tramp, jack-pot
His mum's still at the crack spot
He's hungry and he's hacked off
There's blood all down his tracktop
Them bullies caught him slipping
He curls up when they're kicking
Punching, biting, spitting
Now there's phones out with the cams on
He dies some more inside
Then he cries when he gets stamped on
It's damn wrong
Any part of him that was man's gone
They finally knocked him out, he saw a light and thought he'd found God
Only then to wake, right back inside this town, lost
Cold but he don't care much, his only friend was Jack Frost
His skinny little frame aches
There's cuts upon his grazed face
Trying to find a safe way home, that may be long
He looks above and screams "Why'd you bring this hell on me?"
At night I try and sleep but can't; I hear this song

[Hook]
I ain't seen no man falling like a raindrop
There's no life to live here, this town is a graveyard
Well every day the problem seems to multiply
And everybody's keeping busy getting by
Well if you listen closely you can hear them cry
It's just my city's lullaby

[Verse 2]
Years pass and he was chilling
On this park bench spitting
Freestyling to himself
About his life, that it was hell
When this crazy local villain
Sat down and told him "Listen
I've seen how hard your life has been, I think it's time I helped
If you like, you'll work for me, the boys will welcome you as well
If you've got beef then we've got beef, we'll ride on them with shells
You never deserved the cards you got
Here's your chance to passed them off
Take a gamble, cast the rod
It's time you showed this world"
Says "Yeah man, fuck it
I might as well be thugging
This life has gave me nothing"
Can feel inside himself, the accumulated hatred
Was soon replacing basic
Human moods a face with
A past and you can tell
But it's all about his future now
Olders got him moving round
Running guns, moving grams
Flick-knife on his belt
He's dying to use his blade though
For years you made him scapegoat
Now take note, you try him now, you're getting straight poked
Oh well

[Hook]
I ain't seen no man falling like a raindrop
There's no life to live here, this town is a graveyard
Well every day the problem seems to multiply
And everybody's keeping busy getting by
Well if you listen closely you can hear them cry
It's just my city's lullaby

[Verse 3]
He's the man now, stand down
He's shotting up this mad town
Taxing other shotters with yoggers and his mad pals
I called him Sonic, wherever he went there was always tales
Of clarat and vomit, I think he's trying to even the scale
He feels euphoric, a hoodrat that was beaten down Ironically giving the beatings now
It's all evened out, a child that was screaming out
Is a man with an evil scowl
Oh shit! What's this?
Someone that he's seen in town
Used to punch him around (ho')
Now he's reaching around (yo')
And his heater is out so
Now he's blasting rounds
And his target's down
Like Warren in Barking town
And he's laughing proud
His heart is drowned
Nobody can save him now
He's a monster made by man, Mary Shelly ain't around
So this ain't no act of fiction
When I find these words and fix 'em
To the page to make you see where this child went off the rails
I'm done now

[Hook]
I ain't seen no man falling like a raindrop
There's no life to live here, this town is a graveyard
Well every day the problem seems to multiply
And everybody's keeping busy getting by
Well if you listen closely you can hear them cry
It's just my city's lullaby
