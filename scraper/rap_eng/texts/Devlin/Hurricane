You put your arms around me
I felt the room surrounding
I want to know why together we can be lonely
You sung my favourite song
In my bedroom with nothing on
And as the day dawned on me I fell in love with cold coffee

Cause there is just no other on my mind
I want to feel these colours one last time

Cause darling I crave your love
More than I need your touch
Cause you are like
A hurricane , hurricane kicking off
Cause I don't just want to fuck
Your kiss will be enough
Cause you are like a hurricane
Hurricane kicking off

Perfect storm ironically
You don't know who I am but you follow me
I look into your eyes and they're calm, as when our hearts are in tune harmonically
And I feel as if peace could last for a minute and half then solemnly
The wind picks up and you blow me off don't wanna hear my apology
In fear in this odyssey even though I know that I'm only here metaphorically
Biologically ,engineered technology there's not much that bothers me
But who am I to you
Day dream till the cyclone swallows me
Until my head starts spinning
Linda Blair their ain't no God in me


Cause darling I crave your love
More than I need your touch
Cause you are like
A hurricane , hurricane kicking off
Cause I don't just want to fuck
Your kiss will be enough
Cause you are like a hurricane
Hurricane kicking OFFF
