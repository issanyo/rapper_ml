[Hook - Ghetts] x4
Live in the booth live in the booth
I was caged but now I'm a tiger on the loose

[Verse 1]
Fast lane's clear, all he can do is pass blame here
It's the man who incarnates fear
Big grin and a half grazed stare
Who's him with the half grey hair
Tuned in like guitar strings
Where did he find his bars
Since when did he sound so dark? Flow rare
Can't pick me apart, I'm not fat but well rounded
Angles covered O'Sullivan's prowling
Round this table cut me a break
Before I get Greek and smash a plate over your noggin
No laptop login but pass the word that Jimmy Mack don't play
And if all that these early birds get is worms
Then maybe I'm grateful I'm late

[Verse 2]
This shit should be illegal for me it's easy indeed
Run up on beats and squeeze them and leave like kitty
Blazing a trail through the city once more who's with me
No one? Fine I'm a lonesome guy with a potion high in the local pissy
Drunk chatting shit again
I might spit at men, I might say something silly
Think you're the kid well I'm Billy
Think you're the shit well I feel more shit than shit on a stick
Get shit on by Jimmy, oh really? Yes
Stand at my heights get giddy
Look down, it's a long drop
Wanna test me? Hole in one that's a long shot
Top notch, hop scotch
Watch when I got 'em all back in the box they're getting locked up
Cockblocks will never be pretty
Emcees will never be witty
These blocks will always be gritty
Shock horror, horror shock
Cockblocks will never be pretty
Emcees will never be witty
And these blocks will always be gritty
Shock horror, horror shock

[Verse 3]
If I had two hands on my face, would you know what time it is?
The problem is they don't clock it
The optimist in my logic is dead
And now I'm just launching assaults on the game instead
I ain't even here call me drop dead Fred
I'm just Devs's imaginary friend
One in ten but none of them got any answers either
Fuck it then!
Nah I don't need nothing then
Just me and the things I have got more than a mascot
Back in the race since I ain't going Ascot
But mate you can bloody bet
With the lyrics I'm at the finish line
And you're still in bed
That ill I'm dead
But feeling live with my spirit rhymes
