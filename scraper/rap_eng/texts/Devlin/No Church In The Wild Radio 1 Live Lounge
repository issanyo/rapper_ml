[Ed Sheeran:]
Human beings in a mob
What’s a mob to a King?
What’s a King to a God?
What’s a God to a non-believer
Who don’t believe in anything?

We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild

[Devlin:]
Blood stains on North London floors
Peace to every young person taken by the law
The police equivalent of Raoul Moat is at your door
They've got machine guns and now they're ending lives like it was war
I still get asked for ID for cigarettes at twenty three
But at eighteen, they send the kids abroad and
Give 'em the licence to kill
Tell them to ride but it's still
If that was me and you, we'd see the rest of the life in the ville
With no uphill, so I tell you how I feel
Cause everything I see is lies, so sick it makes me ill
OT from old thugs that run tills, who on drugs
Or on mils with a house up in the hill
I'm tryna follow suit with the latter
To everybody in a manor
If I can be a famous rapper, then you truly will
Break the mould if you wanna
But I ain't no one to follow
I'm just a road kid
With a little more of a passion and honour, so...

[Labrinth:]
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption

[Devlin:]

There ain't no church in the wild to inhabit
Ain't no one to idolize but those who supply to the addicts
Long days, tired nights, why do we fight with this planet?
I don't know but I ain't got the time for bible-bashing
I don't need a God, I need to plot to see the top
So carry on talking instead of walking, then you see the mob
Stood behind me in unison, oportune to the men
That's tired of being down, now we're standing and overruling them
So tell me, what's a peasant with the passion?
Ten times the riches any Pharaoh could imagine
How dare this white gutter child climb out of the chasm
That you thought you could secure me in?
You surely couldn't fathom
World-rated talent inside of a mind, unbalanced
And I ain't been an angel but I'm nothing like a judge
Who gives a beast three years and goes home and makes love
If that's upper class, then I'd rather be scum
Son
