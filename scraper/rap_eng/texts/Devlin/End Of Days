(Intro)
[Shooting, Explosions, Helicopters]
Yeah, yeah

(Verse 1)
According to the Aztec calendar, 2012 is the end of the world
And time will unwind a celestial cross in the skies and syncs in a line with itself
So forget life as you know it
If you wanna view life in the eyes of a poet
Peer through mine in this fearful time where wages are cut but the tax keeps going
When the globe collapses on its axis
Watch men, women and children with axes
Fighting for food cause they're dwelling where the rats live
Cause they haven't got jack shit
It's like disasters' back with a sting like elastic
But on a whole new scale now I'm talking about intergalactic
Genocide in a moment of madness

(Chorus)
As some set on the end of days
Capital city's burning in flames
Oceans swept your possessions away
Welcome to the end of days
As some set on end of days
There ain't no escaping nature's rage
And I've never seen an atheist pray
Until the approaching of judgment day

(Verse 2)
Buildings burning, Pilgrims verming
Children are serving, Searching for earnings
The Old Bill are lurking, Circle the circuit
CCTV cameras are perving, Don't park there if you ain't got a permit
Murders occurring, But low level crime is the type they're concerned with
Yeah with a microchip Bill Gates is a serpent in person
You relied on emergency service 999 says a lot when you turn it
The devil in disguise all love's been deserted
I'm watching animosity spreading like herpes
I visualise alien crafts descending on earthlings
And all homosapiens left in the dirt like worms when there squirming
I smell petrol burning

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Insight into a world of decline
Like Michelle Nostradammas' mind
A moment of peace is harder to find
The thicker the skin the darker the mind
Asteroids in the dark of the night
Accompany stars that ascend from the sky
A lot of men are repenting tonight
You wasted your life now wave it goodbye
New World Order's an anagram of now
So we ain't got time to be standing around
The Devil's on your doorstep
He's got you in a tight grip like a forcep, thunder resounds
[Thunder, Sirens]
What I am witnessing...Is complete and utter chaos...
On the streets of London!

(Chorus)
