Devs, O.T.
We got Devilish. 2007.


In 5 years time,
I've come along way since school days, I was in the bad books always
if I wern't at the head masters,
then mugs'll be facing the walls in the hallways,
I spat bars in the D.O, the only thing that kept me strong than,
them same roads that feds be on & back then if we did a crime
hear the sirens & like lets be gone
Damn!


Since they never guess a lot has changed, no it ain't old school games
then I've got a name
And visually I've seen a lot of pain & back then if I let beef slide
But, I'm not ashamed


I was only a kid then,
I didn't have no access to a big black stick then
now I might run up on your boys & stick them snap 'em
like stick men with a stick bigger than big ben


Came from the bottom to the top,
I'm from a place where the kids threw rocks at the bottom of the blocks,
pushing cds' like drugs got mix tape money in my socks,
Laugh? and they said he ain’t funny is it not,
mugs to be the big then he flopped & its'
been a whole year still waiting for your mix tape to drop, so,
don't mistake the block,


Yo' Im glad I came from the bottom to the top,
cause back then they didn’t want to know,
now I can say that I did it on my own, yeah I'm glad I stuck to the path that I chose,


Yo' Im glad I came from the bottom to the top,
cause back then they didnt want to know,
now I can say that I did it on my own, yeah I'm glad I stuck to the path that I chose


I've been from temptation,
From Flava to  Rinse and the music they savour it since now i’m laughin’,
I started at crack blokes in Barking,
Derelict property with the walls caked in shit
Dem days yeah I was taking a risk,
fell through a glass floor cut veins in my wrist I was lucky that my main arteries got missed
and the hospital pierced with more than one stitch
& They say the game is no referee,
that there coulda' been the death of me
Now I've gotta build on a deficit,
17 with big dreams like i wanna roll In the leather beams,
And i’ve got hearts some ain’t ever seen
Seen what’s possible
Seen where I've come from
Now I'm uncrossable
Money in abundant
Shanks agree scondon
Screaming out London
&' I put in 4 years hard writin’,
they put In more time bitin’, and ye back then I was frightened,
Now I'm killing off the titans
I'm king of the seas like poseidon
I looked up to the mans in the scene
In double O 3 when I was 13
My favourite Mc’s,
tables are turned,
They ain't got nothing on me
Come and see


Yo' Im glad I came from the bottom to the top,
cause back then they didn’t want to know,
now I can say that I did it on my own, yeah I'm glad I stuck to the path that I chose,


Yo' Im glad I came from the bottom to the top,
cause back then they didnt want to know,
now I can say that I did it on my own, yeah I'm glad I stuck to the path that I chose


I remember days they didn't know my name
And now I'm bait & I only got myself to blame but I don't want
a nice watch or a chain you can keep your fame
It's O.T to the grave then back again
and Yea I just lost my job
So it’s back to the roads
Selling weed again
He's selling white again
They're selling crack again
I've got ya back again
Pure drug packaging


Didn't think when I was 12 or 13 the whole scene
would show respect when they heard me,
glad I started early now I'm big the whole scene prefer me
They can hate, but they couldn't of nerved me
I'm fixated with making the papers
Roll with Outtakers i’ve brought up the status
Now ye can't break us
Even god forsakes,  I watch for the haters


Yea Im glad I came from the bottom to the top,
cause back then they didn’t want to know,
now I can say that I did it on my own, yeah I'm glad I stuck to the path that I chose,
