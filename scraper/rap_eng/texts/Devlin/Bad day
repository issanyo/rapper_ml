Another bad day today
See one of them days.. No weed, no cash in the drawers
One of them bad days
Big up Scorcher
It's Dirty Devils, Tales From The Crypt
Yeah..

[Hook]

I had a bad day today, nothing could have gone my way
Just another 24 hours, I gotta do something productive
So I've got one thing to smile for
I had a bad day today, nothing could have gone my way
Just another 24 hours, I gotta do something productive
So I've got one thing to smile for

[Verse 1]

My diabetes getting me down
I be out with my mates and smoking bare eights
That's all I wanna do
But in the last two years, I've lost two stone in weight
And I know I ain't doing this right
My organs are hurting inside and my Mum goes to bed of a night
And she cries cause she's worried, while i'm on the road with a zute and my buddies
Wish that I could tell her don't worry but she's got good reason
In front of her eyes, her son's healths decreasing
Smoking and drinking when I should be eating, i'm gonna die one evening
And yeah i'll take care of any MC but this illness man it's got a hold of me
So if I end up laying in a hearse just know that I prayed to my Mum first, first, first..

[Verse 2]

If i'm honest then I wanna be rich
Move away from these bits where man's are on sniff
And man's are on crack, put a knife in your back
They'll come and attack for the stack, strapped with a gat
And, do you think I wanna live round here
Do you think I wanna raise my kids round here
If i'm honest then I wanna get paid
And move away today's another bad day
I live for today cause I dunno what i'm doing tomorrow
Although I could probably guess, another bad day God wants to put me to the test
Til the day that i'm laying to rest I hope I get paid in advance and move to Spain or France
And live away the rest of my days
But as long as i'm still here the fact remains with no papes and no weed to blaze

[Hook]

I had a bad day today, nothing could have gone my way
Just another 24 hours, I gotta do something productive
So I've got one thing to smile for
I had a bad day today, nothing could have gone my way
Just another 24 hours, I gotta do something productive
So I've got one thing to smile for

[Verse 3]

Had enough of this same city skyline
Dirty old roads and derelict high rise
I told you I wanna live the high life, yes I wanna fly high
Any way, back to my life
No P's in my pocket i'm broke, no weed in my blunt can't smoke
Life is a joke but you won't see me laughing, living a life I don't wanna live
And the mood i'm in today, hit you with a clip full of hollow tips
This kid wants to come and start politics, quickly abolish it
It's like they didn't hear what I told them, acknowledge it
And it's just another bad day, straight up mad day
Things are on foul play, think it's safe then how safe?
Thugs come and creep in your house mate
Everybody's filled with hate

[Hook]

I had a bad day today, nothing could have gone my way
Just another 24 hours, I gotta do something productive
So I've got one thing to smile for
I had a bad day today, nothing could have gone my way
Just another 24 hours, I gotta do something productive
So I've got one thing to smile for
