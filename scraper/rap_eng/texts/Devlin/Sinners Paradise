[Music/Lyric - Marcus Ehlin]

All dressed in shadows
The whore awaits the night
Creeping through the graves of filth and lust
Sunlight decays, moonlight heals
Welcome to sinners paradise

The whore all dressed in white
Longing for her lovers bite

Come on in my precious fiend
Unite with me in ecstasy
Explore my flesh, enter my womb
Taste the food of the gods

"Welcome to sinners paradise
Where dreams and decadence will revive
This is our paradise
Where purity and moral dies"

Garden of delight, Eden of sin
Essence of evil from within
Along with her shadows
The whore awaits the night
Welcome to sinners paradise

"Welcome to sinners paradise
Where dreams and decadence will revive
This is our paradise
Where impurity and immoral never dies"
