[Hook]
Show me who you know who really flows
Show me who you know is really cold
Show me who you think is really in my zone
And I bet he's someone in the circle that I know

Show me someone that you think is spitting venom
I'll take his freedom in a sentence like a judge
Show me something that I don’t know
Before it’s too late, I came to wrap the whole game up

[Verse 1]
MCs, I should punch you in your mouths
You ain’t from the streets, you spit shit on funky house
European dance mixed into trance
Can't feel safe with all the jewellery on your arms
I bet you no-one even knew you in your manor
Before you got a deal spitting swag bars
I put my manor on the map and
I've been running round these streets from my young teens carving out a path
Forget modest, I’ve been modest too long
I burried you in freestyles, bodied you in songs
Call me Devs, call me Jim Laden, call me Kong
Beating on my chest, now it’s time to get it on
Show me someone that you think I should be weary of
I'll grab his cranium and tear it off
To fill it full of thoughts, that'll make him think twice
Stepping 'round the mic when I'm present, I’m feral

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I see pop stars posing like rap stars
You been urban act stashing what the facts are
In your videos posing in your flash cars
You don’t even own, walk the street alone
You find it you get moved to quicker
The mice inside of the rifle's home
I guess I’m one of afew true spitters
The rest can't cut it, so slice 'em to the bone
System overload, is too late
I'm cracking up, smacking up, MCs who never roamed the roads
Never bought an ounce of anything apart from gold
You ain't got no credibility, you bastards know
I've been a force up in the underground
Since them nights that I was writing in my mother's house
I've never been no type but big man
Just a little six, screaming out, fuck ‘em now

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Who the fuck told you it was fire you were spraying?
You know who you are and so do I
So what you saying?
Nothing cause your management would tell you not to speak
Mine would tell me burn ‘em and then fight 'em in the street
Cash hungry vermin, I deprive 'em of their sleep
Scare 'em like a nightmare, the way I ride the beat
Ain’t about the vegetables, it ain’t about the peas
As long as I’m the best within my field then I'm at ease
Underground, overground, Devs might mow you down
In the vehicle, that was stolen at your mother's house
My father ain't Samuel
But the way I kill all these MCs, I feel like the son of Sam
Show me who you know really flows
I'll bkow 'em back, like I was rolling with a gun in hand
All I know is that there's not that many pros
So when I'm around, I have to keep it really cold

[Hook]
