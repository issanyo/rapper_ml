[Intro: Sharky Major]
Man are lyrically flawless, applaud this
One of the first to bring forth the bonus
Shark Attack remix what you call this
Every artist I featured, sick from the bits and
Hot like the middle of August
Bars on lock like a fortress
Me, I'm a bossman and I give out the orders
Step across and get floored fam, be cautious

[Hook: Sharky Major]
When Shark attacks, they can't react
Heartbeats increase and it becomes hard to relax
I'll forever stay large
Different class, in fact, for the bars
When Shark attacks, they can't react
Control the mic like a spitter in charge
Me, I'm not any one of these dargs
Some ah talk hard when they are nothing but soft

[Verse 1: Devlin]
When Devlin attacks and advances
Make way and I'll say that it's time
That you waved goodbye to your chances
You'll get shot like grasses, Devz is the largest
In grime I'm like Giggs, they all call me the hardest
Lyrically I've never been tarnished
I'll make 'em disappear like the Doctor in the TARDIS
The one-man army is marching
When Devlin attacks, their defence will collapse
I don't care about you, so compare me to a switch
I only concentrate on my camp
We're all fucked like contracting HIV from a tramp
Carry on sending 'em forward, I'm sending 'em back
Cause it's plain black and white like I sent 'em a fax
My bars are first class like Elizabeth's face on a stamp
And I'm a great white shark, too large to contain in a tank
Kick off your door, scream "empty the drawers"
Like I was Victor raiding a bank, call me Crocodile Dundee
Stinking of whisky and waving a shank
They must be brave or insane to react
Let me minus the crap until all that remains is the facts
Step back when it's shark attack

[Verse 2: Sharky Major]
When Shark attacks, they can't react
The dark lyrics and bars will scar typically
Rip apart spitters who advance to them lyrically
Tell a mic man go grab a girl
No hype, fam, you're not parallel like symmetry
Dun know I'm gung ho about it
Tell a man literally any attempt to try spinning me
Will only end in my victory
I'm an artist, you can never outclass this
The bars should be framed and displayed
In the Tate Gallery, I'm just great, can't shatter me
I bring tragedy, bare anarchy
On a breh that tries battle me
Whose mixtape man'll casually
Give away like I'm donating to charity
What I spray's fat like my bars ate too much calories
When Shark attacks, no way you could tackle me
Who wants to attend a masterclass?
Bars evidently far apart
Step against me, I'll blast your clart
So cold like I've come out of Ice Age
We can go at it all day till after dark
All I know right now, the mindstate's
Violate, man'll run up in a guy's gates
For the papes, iced out watch and a nice chain

[Verse 3: P Money]
When P attacks, they can't react
No? Skinny sorts wanna talk on YouTube
P, I don't really care about who's who
P, I beat the tune on new crews
When P attacks, they can't react
No? Skinny tools wanna talk on YouTube
P, I don't really care about who's who
P, I beat the tune on new crews
I don't care what she likes
Man can't say I'm not top 10 in England
Bury anybody disagreeing in an instant
Stage show duppy or Sunday Rinse them
I win war better than Sir Winston
MCs wanna bite me but the venomous bars'll
Shut down the whole of your body system
Wanna be cool? Then keep your distance
I'm the teacher, teaching these infants
How you gonna tell me your CD's sick
When it compresses way more air than a piston?
I don't see the point in your resistance
P, I make more than a difference
A rear-view mirror can't see you in the distance
You can talk the talk about wetting guys
But this badboy's water-resistant

[Verse 4: Dot Rotten]
When Rotten attacks, my posture's relaxed
But you better be off in a flash
I'll make a soundboy stop in his tracks
Astounded, surrounded by more numbers than a lottery has
The philosophy's swag, who cares if you oftenly shank
You ain't got no gwop for the mic
And you're probably sat in your room with a pen and pad
Writing my bars all off of this track
When Rotten attacks, the violence [?]
Bring out the dark on no enemy [?] delivery straight to your kidney
I own this like their grind up originally
Take me down? No way you'll find the ability
Even if you try sign your life to the military
[?] facility
I've been here from On Top, rhyming with Killa P
I'll rise above all the lies, I despise
When artists analyse all my lines and my formula
Not blind, see a side of mine and order ya
But it's OK, been a long way from broke days in '08
Now I find when there's more to come, they ask for more
But I'm sure the war is done
In beef, pull out a heat that could scorch the sun
Just know a G when you talk to one, Rotten

[Verse 5: Ghetts]
When Ghetto attacks
I do it when I want, cause I wanna
When there's something again
So many fans want Ghetto to clash
An MC, I get it over that
I run the track, manaman a get overlapped
Hello, I've got more fuel than Esso
That's why you never see Ghetto relax
Man ah get stung like I'm yellow and black
Bzz, I've got a buzz like a nest of wasps
Number one for four years running
Guess what? Still I ain't left this spot
There's still more to come, I don't wanna hear nothing
He's sending, he's sending, he can't stop sending
Oh, is that the best you've got?
Just cause you say Ghetts a lot
Please don't think you can stand up next to God
Lord of the Mics wanna film this war, it's alright
They can't afford me, I'm nice
Everyone's got their money on the underdog
I wonder what sent them all to decide
If my man's fire, I'm water alie
Normally, I get caught in the hype
But right now them man are going number one
So a hit's the only thought in my mind
