When I started out
Writing you this song
I was heels over head in love
But you had your doubts
'Cause it took too long
To finally see what I
What I'd been doing wrong
I tried to love you but
You still loved him so
I'll ignore my heart and lie to the truth
I'll lie to the truth
A love of mine once said
"The best part about you was me"
So now who is judging who?
I know I broke your heart
Mine is broken too
Now if we're even
Then why are we both blue?
I tried to be true but
You still love him so
I lie in silence and
Feel like a fool
I lie to the truth
I think that I have had enough
I guess that I have had enough of you
I think that I have had enough
I know that I have had enough of you
We tried to be true but
You still loved him so
I'll keep my distance
And lie to the truth
I lie to the truth
I lie to the truth
'Cause you lied to it too
