[Hook:]
As my head spins, I don't know
How this slide show had the time to grow
I was too interested, on living life alone
Running through the manor
Chasing money, chasing slappers
Man, doesn't really matter
I'm just trying to make this happen, here's a letter to my boys

[Verse 1:]
Out to everyone I ran the streets with
You know more so, that this here is deep shit
Me, Wilsey and Dulph, inside of a cheap whip
Or in the park in a Friday night with three chicks
Or up Lenny's, before he had the belly
A few less scars too, a bit less rough and ready
Bags it out, trying to earn money bags already
Face is in the place, back when Grav's yard was heavy
Joe, gave me half O, see me start slow
Freestyling in his Dad's flat with Gurdack
Then he disappeared and never thought to turn back
Up to jackos, see my wrist slashed my glass smashed
When little Guiness was as quiet as a field mouse
We would've stole your car and probably burnt the fields down
When i was bigger than my little brother
Heathway to Princes, there's too many names to cover

[Hook:]
As my head spins, I don't know

[Verse 2:]
As it grew, I feel i got a fraction older quicker
I felt lonely inside and maybe slightly bitter
Start writing, told myself I'll be a spitter
Then I met dogs and Mikey and the Picture figured
Too people i could click with on an older level
Mike saw the full pattern, Dogz could see the rebel
At just fifteen I resurrected my whole crew from hard times
Young and on this mad vibe
Then we met Deepz and Cozzie and we brought em in
Along with Benson and M.eye, I Knew from my sides
Back in '05 when we used to smoke and drink
Fifty kids on Broad Street, on the corner pissed
Way back when there was meat upon my bones
A shoe lace around my neck, held my keys and phone
Heathway, to Lego Flats, Chequers back to Valence House
We represent it to the fullest for our habitat

[Verse 3:]
Deeper had two friends, called Mike & Wes
My boys now, we share a bag and light the blessed
Wes knew Ghetts, I Met Ghetts at Manor Park
In the youth club with Hastie and we sprayed some bars
Three years prior, Rest In Piece, Haste
Remember days he used to run around the Heathway
But I don't get to see your face into these days
Last craze, will I make it through this blind rage
Ghetts started showing love, and really understood
Though I was better than fucking good, he ran the hood
Behind the mic, just like we still do
Danny C's was too expensive, we moved to Lew's
Who by the way, I forgot to say
I met when I was 13, I knew his brother 'Blaze'
From Romford to Victoria Road we used to spray
Bars on the old mic, we're jumpy records played
So
