Yeah, trust me.. Deeperman, Devlin
It's all Tales From The Crypt 2006
OT, Dogenham Alliance


[Verse 1 - Deeperman]

I give you a lot of peng, we shot again
So I might run up in your yard with a lot of men
Them boy they never talking shit like I'm hotter than
Six of your hottest men, don't think you're big cause you've got a skeng
It's not hard my friend, anyone can cop a skeng
Claiming your a gun man but I know you ain't bust yet
So why you telling lies for? You know I felt sick innit
Why you on a hype for? Come off it quick innit
Before you get rolled on, left with no dole don
Jumped on the floor now you got shit to hold on
Think I'm a prick you got told wrong
I roll up with 30 rebels, It's Deeperman Dan and Dirty Devilz
Tales From The Crypt, it's all levels
And if you ain't showing any, then move on
Cause round here we're working hard and fast
It's all OT and the Dogenham Alliance

[Hook]

It's Devz and Deeperman, do this
We all know what the truth is, OT are moving ruthless
And them boys are past it, they're useless, useless, useless
It's Devz and Deeperman, do this
We all know what the truth is, OT are moving ruthless
And them boys are past it, they're useless, useless, useless

[Verse 2 - Devlin]

I'm used to leaving them speechless, tear an MC into pieces
Then I'll look inside your mind like telekinesis and I'll seek for your weakness
Wanna send for the team do you know how many rules that breaches?
It's Tales From The Crypt with a feature from Deeper
So now you know how deep the team is
Straight from the street, that's where the cream is
Teenage drug dealers drive beemers
You don't wanna get fucked up like your Fila's
And if you wanna battle take you to the cleaners
Coming on miles you're moving in metres and stop acting facetious
Like you could actually beat us, your heads in the sky like Jesus
Black hoody like the Grim Reeper
Tales From The Crypt, Dirty Devilz and Deeper

[Hook]

It's Devz and Deeperman, do this
We all know what the truth is, OT are moving ruthless
And them boys are past it, they're useless, useless, useless
It's Devz and Deeperman, do this
We all know what the truth is, OT are moving ruthless
And them boys are past it, they're useless, useless, useless

[Verse 3 - Deeperman]

Your girls grimey how could you wifey that
Wanked in her mouth, now you're licking inside of that
You're a pussy I can see it in your face
And I know you like the taste of having pussy on your face
You're a wanker, you don't get any girls and when you do it's a fat bird with a pussy that smells
But still you wanna lick around her mot like you're on it and you're repping, never
Pussies get moved out my ends like cannabis
Now you can't manage this, I've done my research like an analyst
Fuck what you heard I'm not having this, your boys are stabbing this
My boys will run up in your crib and leave you cunts wounded
Run up on your set and fuck it up like my tune did
I leave you sweating like the hot weather when it's humid
Deeperman, Deeperman, that's the new word
About Tales From The Crypt it's not hard blood work it out


[Hook]

It's Devz and Deeperman, do this
We all know what the truth is, OT are moving ruthless
And them boys are past it, they're useless, useless, useless
It's Devz and Deeperman, do this
We all know what the truth is, OT are moving ruthless
And them boys are past it, they're useless, useless, useless

[Verse 4 - Devlin]

Fucked up lyricist, stepping up while these pricks spit gibberish
It's really, vividness
And I kill dicks like, syphilis
Broke free from the chrysalis now I'm gonna fly away
You can try and stay but you will die away
I don't care what they try and say
Nower days say my face is bait like when I'm walking on my estate
I gotta raise up to higher stakes, so I'm out of the clutches
I'm on the roads where it's roughest and hitting up your girlfriends crutches
OT some grimey motherfuckers, I told them boys that they just can't touch us
Acting suspicious, all these fake guys that pretend to be vicious
Straight from the streets where there's junkies and snitches
Deeper and Devilz, the hungriest spitters, spitters, spitters, spitters...
