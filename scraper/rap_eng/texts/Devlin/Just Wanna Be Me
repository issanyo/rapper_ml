[Hook]
I just wanna be me
I just wanna be me
Til the day that I'm free
You do you, I'll do me

[Verse 1]
I look back now and I can't explain it
Always knew that i was waiting for greatness
Mum wanted me to work in the slave shift
But I was writing my lyrics in the grave shift
Perfecting the style so amazing I rose through the ranks so quick I was blazing
Sorry to upset you mother but right now I've gotta do me. Time's wasting
I had a scheme and a dream. Time that I prove I could stand on my feet
Jab or weave here in the city full of feats and fiends
Life don't stop, time don't sleep
I feel like I'm lost
My ears are on fire, they speak
And they all think they know what's best but...

[Hook]
I just wanna be me
I just wanna be me
Til the day that I'm free
You do you and I'll do me


[Verse 2]
They laugh at your vision, make a lasting decision
To let your heart be driven
Like the Batmobile with the Stig in
Keep shit real in the field no fibbin'
Real we can feel cause that's how we're living
We're all different here in Great Britain
So embrace yourself and envision that your skin never left you imprisoned
Be whatever you wanna be man, kill 'em
You're unlike any other, aim for the sky my brother
Do it your way, this life is a bitch but love her
In the doorway I see the ghost of a soul that I knew last summer
Love to your girl and your kids and your mother
We can't hold joy without stifer

[Hook]
I just wanna be me
I just wanna be me
Til the day that I'm free
You do you and I'll do me

[Verse 3]
They're like Devs do a grime track, I'm like why, would you like that?
Would you lend me your score if things got raw like before on the floor no money up in my bank
I didn't think so mate so let me do me in this life while I wait to right my mistakes
Wipe these slates everyday is a new blind date
I'm unsure of what I just might face but as long as I'm true to myself what this path might lead to is fate
I'll follow this road like that Dorothy girl
Even if the bricks ain't golden and I bet I do it historically well
I ain't no big shot in your focus just me in this illogical world

[Hook]
I just wanna be me
I just wanna be me
Til the day that I'm free
You do you and I'll do me
