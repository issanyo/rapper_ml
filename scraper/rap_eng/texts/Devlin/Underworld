[Music/Lyric - Marcus Ehlin]

Watchers of the paths apostles
Woeful fiends of night
Come inside my flaming wound
As day fades into dark

Ride with me, scorns of blackness
On the wings of death
Bear my name, seal my blood
Turn against the light

"Hear them, calling from the underworld
They call for me
Hear them, calling from the underworld"

Warders of my destiny
Infernal soldiers of my past
Come inside my flaming wound
As day fades into night

Ride with me, sons of thunder
On the wings of death
Bear my name, seal my fate
Turn against the light
