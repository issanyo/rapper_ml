[Music/Lyric - Marcus Ehlin]

So beautiful
Your dreams of me
I'm the answers to all your pain

I'm your savior, dare you die without me?

We are so close
Only an edge between
I will embrace you
A magic still to be born

Can you live without me?
Can you sleep without me?
Can you die without me?
I'm your savior
Can you live without me?
Can you sleep without me?
Can you die without me?
I'm your angel
