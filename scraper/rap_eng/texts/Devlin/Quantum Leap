[Verse 1: Proverbz]
Now looking on back on my life, I made some bad decisions
From one disaster to the next, on the maddest mission
It's like my whole existence has been a single act of vandalism
Now I feel I'm trapped, I'm like a man in prison
Like a mad magician, I flipped and turned into an angry wizard
Now they trying to trap me in the blackest blizzard
See the cataclysm coming so I'm working like a mathematician Tryna find a pattern in this algorithm
And now I understand the formula is scientific
I'm throwing caution to the wind, yeah I'm quite explicit
Kinda mystical I traveled through mind village
Reading out an ancient curse, writ in blood and hieroglyphics
It feels apocalyptic, I know the clock is ticking
I'm seeing bars written, equations and quantum physics
Feeling proper twisted, and even though I need a doctor's visit
I'ma keep it steppin' and be optimistic

[Verse 2: Devlin]
They got flavour like a plain naan
All these spitters rave bars
Who want the same women, same clothes, same cars
Making art I'll turn your windscreen into stained glass
Fakers made me laugh and Nick Minaj for only fake arse
They ain't the same class, you know were fireproof
So you can let your flames blast, who you lying to
Me or you I'm like a phoenix when I'm flying through
I'll burn you and I shit on you
And turn around and spit on you
Got more manoeuvres than a kamasutra
I ain't a thief, I'm a hardened looter
I'll steal your aunt's computer
Place a picture of my penis on the screensaver
And then return it whilst she's working like a week later
Whoever told you I'm laming is not advanced enough
The hard of hearing, the jeering, the sneering
But I'll make the fear of the gods appear when I'm near and
I'm stopping 'em interfering
And drop 'em off in the clearing
Inside of the forest

[Verse 3: Proverbz]
So when I get angry I stand and I face north
And I pray to the god of war 'til I'm ready to draw swords
Fuck it
'til I'm dead and I'm ready and all for
Anything you can call forth and I've never been more sure
That you're drawing the short straw
Leave you dead on the forecourt
Leave you peppered and sprayed up
Like your slipping and caught short
In the grip of a dark force, now you're ripping the past shortly
You're tripping you can't warn and you're sick and you can't talk
Now I don't know what happened I'm crazy and barbaric
Insane and I'm half gut, I've been changed by dark magic
These dangerous sleep habits are making me reek havoc
They making me dream angels, and making me speak backwards
Escaping the crime scene in the jeans and a dark jacket
I'm springing for car crashes, and swinging this large axe
It's like an ice berg, hitting and sinking the Titanic
I'm spitting it's like acid, splitting your mind rapid
To beats that I found when I was asleep in a deep cavern
And a creature appeared and gave me the key to a green cabin
It kept in a dark cabin, and guarded by dark dragons
I followed this white rabbit, I'm wandering like Alice
I was young I used to play in the dirt
And the deep worms be keeping these dead birds
And breeding these deep maggots
I spent long days troubled and stuck in a deep malice
In this hate filled struggle but fuck it I keep at it
