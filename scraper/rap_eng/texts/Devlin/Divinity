[Music/Lyric - Marcus Ehlin]

From the dark, dismayed
I crave what can't be craved
I have become, what needs to be
Licking my own flames
Feel my life, running through your veins
All bitter, but truly divine
A former shadow, that purified
Into blackness, infernal pride

Blood red tears, crimson eyes
The cursed face that hypnotize

"I am He, the fear of man
Highest god, the scorn Divine
Be my mistress, triumph with me in sin
I am the scorn Divine"

Shadows extending
Divinity falling deeper than death
My flaming poison will be your spawn
Feel my life, running through your veins
All bitter, but truly divine
A former shadow, that purified
Into blackness, infernal pride

"Call forth the Ones of air
Call forth the Ones of earth
Call forth your own death
Call forth the Ones of water
Call forth the Ones of fire
Call forth your own poisonous death"
