[Verse 1]
When I'm spittin' on grime, I bring it to life
I roll like a menace at night, the venomous type
I'm back with the venom inside
The Devlin guy, the fella that was fed up of life
And went in, step back from the mic
You don't wanna scrap nor fight
Corned Beef City is haunted and gritty
Run for the hills, be scared for your life
Or else be down to ride just like phillies
Silly isn't it they listenin' but don't hear me
Man this shit can't stand
So that's why I'm cuttin' their achilles
One by one 'til they all fall down
They're sayin' that they're ready, are they really?
I ain't Van Dan but I'll run up on your clan
Kick your girlfriend straight in the kitty
Oh God damn, what's wrong with this man?
(What's wrong with this man?)

[Hook]
I'm like lots
Ask Terms, ask Shots
Ask Ratch, ask Rawz ask Dogz
I think that I've lost the plot
Came back for the, back for the lot
And it's fact that my faction is hot
From the booth right back to the block
(Right back to the block)
(Right back to the block)

[Verse 2]
Grime killer I deserve life in a box
Mass murder your squad, get burnt and I'm gone
Might be strong and the time ain't long
You be back home right where you belong
Dity Dags, the hood's on fire
The mack might clap when the drama is on
Animal acts, you'll get stalked by the pap
Dead men's shoes, you don't really wanna be inside them clogs
We're alive but we're lost
Tell me what does irony cost?
Well my name's Devlin
But they wanna look at me like God
You know what? I ain't nobody's savior
When I'm chained to this glacier I'm a slave to the frost
Like I made it with Sadie, and got knee deep in her slot, oh gosh

[Hook]
Ask Terms, ask Shots
Ask Ratch, ask Rawz ask Dogz
I think that I've lost the plot
Came back for the, back for the lot
And it's fact that my faction is hot
From the booth right back to the block
(Right back to the block)
(Right back to the block)

[Verse 3]
This ain't a drill, no screw don
Who the fuckin' hell are you, son?
Find an exit and use one
Under credited for anythin' the crew done
Still relative, a relative to you son
We're all brothers in this settlement, it's too glum
Soon come, rise of a true sun
Too blunt, I can be a true cunt
Too drunk, chattin' to a new slut
Too fucked, to ever give two fucks
Unless I had sisters lubed up, who's up?
You wanna make a move huh?
I'm killin' fish with this big harpoon gun
Move up or get moved up by Devs
As far as young men go, I'm a rude one
There's six million ways you can die
Give me time, I'm still tryna choose one, oh gosh

[Hook]
Ask Terms, ask Shots
Ask Ratch, ask Rawz ask Dogz
I think that I've lost the plot
Came back for the, back for the lot
And it's fact that my faction is hot
From the booth right back to the block
(Right back to the block)
(Right back to the block)
