[Hook : Devlin]
How different is my life to another man's
I'm just trying to earn a living in this cold, cold place
And then escape to the summer sands
[Ghetts]
Until my time has expired I'll be trying

[Dogzilla]
And I finally found something I'll never give up
Finally found something I could be proud of
I finally found something I can be proud of

[Verse 1 : Ghetts]

Hustling, money coming in, there ain't nothing worse
Than watching mummy struggling
Suffering and I can't tell you how easy it is
But I can tell you how tough it's been

I know you're wondering, well, first off
I would need a warehouse to store my troubles in
Nobody's aware of what I'm covering up but one thing
I'll erupt, my blood's bubbling

I'm stressed out, frustrated and hungry
That's enough to send a man over the edge humpty
And if it ain't me against the world
Then I feel like I'm going against this whole country

Nobody's on my side, they wanna take my soul
Body and my mind
But I still got a problem with authority
So what should I decide?

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Devlin]

First off for too many years I've been worse off now
Every single verse is bloody worth dosh
It's hard to always stay on track, sometimes I swerve off
Life's a lesson, in a second you could learn a lot

Give me the chance to accelerate and I'm burning off
Because I've been left too long to rot in the eternal fog
And I was always told to aim for the stars
Now I'm cruising through space like Scotti and the captains log

Deep space mind, don't hate me
Just make yours how I make mine, take time to stay tight
And when times get messy like a cage fight
We will soon see which individual suffers stage fright

I'll be ready on the double
My flows flexible and supple leave you buried
Like a dead man in the rubble
Fully proud how my teams emerging
From the tunnel full of never ending trouble

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Dogzilla]

I was on the road all day or I was getting locked up
Had find some other ways of how to change my life up
[?] can't decipher
I was on the path but sometimes I fucked it right up

I was either thinking I should leave or I should quit
But something always telling me but I don't know what it is
I got something I am proud of, I'm enjoying this
I know, I know, I know, I'm so great in this

I would always try my best but nothing ever worked
So someone please just tell me straight
Cause now I'm feeling worse
Now my pockets are on fire all my credits burnt
I always paid the price and I never learn

I was just a crazy kid, broke and I was lost
Cause anytime I would flip and they would call me dogs
Always scrapping, always fighting, show my teeth [?]
But music has changed my life, now I'm never lost

[Hook]
