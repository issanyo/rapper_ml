You don't know how sick that it can be
When I crack hands get pissed with the family
My brain is insisting, maybe I'm twisted
'Cause I've got mad men around me
I come up with ghetts and dogz how the fuck d'you expect me not to be rowdy
I'll flip the script like a pog
Then what you can all drop dead like Bambi
With the rhymes I'm handy like Andy
So high that I'll stand on the andies
Murder a man on the mic when I'm angry
I put my dick on your girlfriends lip like a lolly or a candy stick
Then run to the backdoor quick I'm sick
What the fuck did you think? I was ever gonna love this link?
Now I'm walking home with her old mans brandy
Listen; Jim's disgusting
And you're thick if you think you can trust him
As far as a sumo wrestler physically thrust him
I'm gonna blow like a porn star busting
Life is a bitch with a beard and a compacter dustbin
Get ya nuts in
I gotta get stuck right in if I really wanna win
How many wanna swing on this lyrical thing
Not many I'm burying any you bring
Decapitate any bitch like Henry the eighth
So dont try put it to the king
There's certain rules to abide by
Make a man drop like a drive bye
When I gotta mic and a hi-fi I'm lord of the ring
Draw for my sword then swing
For his chin leave half of his jaw line gone with the wind
Let your mouth run away then what can I say
You're on the floor with pins in all four limbs
Like Christ in his final days
Remove the skin from your shins and use it as a blindfold for your face
You wouldn't wanna see what I do
Wouldn't wanna be in my crew or be in my shoes
You wanna drop bars like these on a tune? You wouldn't wanna be in the booth
You'll be out of your depth
I'll rip a main artery out of your neck
I've said more in half of a sec
Then you could ever contain in one breath
I'm just spitting abnormal ability
Lyrically like paranormal activity
Coming out for the fight of my life
Like I'm Muhammad Ali in the Philippines
Its Jim laden
Don't take offence like a thieve in the garden
You just can mimic me
Lyrically I cannot be explained scientifically
