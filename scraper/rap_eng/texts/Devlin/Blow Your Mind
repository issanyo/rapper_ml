[Intro: Maverick Sabre]
You know I'll blow your mind, my friend, again

[Verse 1: Devlin]
Well I heard they think they're grimey now, okay
I think that we're gonna need fireman out 'cause I'm Jim McVeigh
When I run up in the game, I'm firin' out, mind out of the way
10 years in the game, no tirin' out, I'm here, what the vitals say?
What goes and don't, I keep rollin' like I've got broken brakes
Any foes I face, wanna meet in a public, open space
So you know my brain's one sandwich short of a picnic
James don't play no games, Creegan here with a hand grenade
I make people cheer when I rant and rave
I ain't nowhere near to a diva mate, I'm just bait
I make kids from the bits, wanna re-relate and write pages full of what freedom ain't
It's outrageous, hey man, I beat the rain
I'm out-takin' still, I'll steal your fame
No need, they know my name
It's D to the E-V, L-I-N when you see me, don't watch my face
You wouldn't wanna be me, at times I think I'm lost in space
Scotty just beam me or I'll end this shit like a Boston race
There's a problem wait, there should have been a lot more flames

[Hook: Maverick Sabre]
You know I'll blow your mind, my friend, again
And I'm here to show you I ain't never left
You know I'll blow your mind, my friend
Loaded on that green floating on your genes
I'll be that lion to your queen

[Verse 2: Devlin]
Back on the riddim with a bang
And there ain't no bitin' this with a fang
Insultin' me, how dare you, damn
I'm nuts, you're mad
I'm comin', get down when I'm reachin' around inside this coat
Don't know what I just might find
I hope it's a knife and rope
High grade I thought I smoked
And money for the cab that'll get me home
Don't wanna roll
Well if it's cos I'm white then let me know
And I'll bite your faces, racists
Hate this, wanna be changin' places
Makin' moves on a regular basis
In Satan's grove, I'll conquer the beast
No way will he take my soul
Then gain control of the scene like back in the day
Then let them haters know that my ancient throne ain't vacant no
No, no way José, who the fuck's José?
I'll see him on the road and leave him slain
I'm goin' on cold, I'm back on the wave
You've been told
Don't ask me why I'm past deep
Every time these stars speak, I'm sick they turned up last week
And they think they're the shit, well guess who's back?
The boy from Dags is going on rags
And if you don't love me, then fuck you

[Hook: Maverick Sabre]
You know I'll blow your mind, my friend, again
And I'm here to show you I ain't never left
You know I'll blow your mind, my friend
Loaded on that green floating on your genes
I'll be that lion to your queen

[Bridge: Devlin]
To everyone that's high and everyone's that drunk
To everyone that finds that life is kinda fucked
To everyone that died before their time was up
Live your lives through me, it's time we live it up

[Outro: Maverick Sabre]
Don't you know where I've, I've been coming from
Know I, see I, I'll blow your mind away
