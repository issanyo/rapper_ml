I've been up for nights and days
And my eyes remain wide awake
Because more than my life's at stake
So I ain't got time for blinkin
All the time I'm thinkin
If this ain't hell it's one firey place
Metallic projectiles fly in ya face
And leave you like human garbarge lyin in drains
I gotta keep my eyeballs open
The only thing thatll minus the pain like ibuprofen is
9 Million K in a case
I don't feeel incontrol like pilots in planes
I'm trapped in this winding maze
I'm an insomniac I'm insane

[Hook:]
I've been up for days and nights throguh this crazy life but
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until they pay me right
My eyes are open wide but
I'll sleep when I'm dead

When everything on my to do list is ticked off
Then maybe I can drift off
Until then I'm wide awake, lyin in a daze
My eyeballs gaze
Hypnotised by the sound of my wrist watch
Clickin tick tock
I'm incharge of the Underground just like Brick Top
So I can't sleep I'd be wrong if I did stop
If I'm focused on writing a verse
You couldn't put me to sleep with a thousand and nine bottles of night nurse
It's likely I'll put ya lights out first
So I'll sleep when I'm restin in peace
Until then I've gotta bless these beats
Till I conquer the streets
If I'm conscious I can't get lost in a dream

[Hook:]
I've been up for days and nights throguh this crazy life but
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until they pay me right
My eyes are open wide but
I'll sleep when I'm dead

If you're drowsy remain in a slumber
My metaphors flow over ya head like a buttonless jumper
I can'#t sleep till I'm in the sky like lightning and thunder
Sometimes at night I wonder
Is pursuein this dream a blunder
Or the best thing that I ever did
I can't sleep or slip till I'm 6 feet under
Hence the song I'll sleep when I'm dead
You might only need money to survive
But my life relies on a needle instead
I wanna eat steak meals everyday
I'm sick and tired of livin on a diet of beans and bread
So believe what I said
I'll sleep when I'm where
I'll sleep when I'm what
I'll sleep when I'm dead

[Hook: x2]
I've been up for days and nights throguh this crazy life but
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until they pay me right
My eyes are open wide but
I'll sleep when I'm dead
