When the sky breaks it rains
So just let the H2O splash upon the graves
Of all the souls I used to know but now have passed away
Men say that time can heal a situation
But this pain is not a passing phase
Now I'm curious how many years a heart can ache
Feel like a Minotaur meandering this darkened place
Trying to find a way to maybe find the light of day
If I could rewind then I'd re-live my life again
And sit and hold my nan's hands while she felt the pain
And say hello to old mates behind the pearly gates
Given the chance to glance back at my childish face
I'd try and smile the way I smiled just like a child again
Before I had to say goodbye to anybody
And the loved ones I've lost all had life within their bodies
My side was less lonely then
You wanna cry well come and hold me then
I think I need the blessing of some holy man
Cause everything is different now
I'd really like to tell you how
How I wanted you here by my side
I know what I said but I lied
It looked like I laughed but I cried
But I wish I could push rewind
I wish I could push rewind
If I had minutes on my hand
