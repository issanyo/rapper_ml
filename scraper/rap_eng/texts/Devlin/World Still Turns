Listen, they wanna build me up
Postpone my attempt to kill my bars
Well, you better have an army
'Cause it's day one, all of my boys show love
Now I'm here where I should be
When I'm high of a night, I wonder where I would be
On the streets where the thieves and the hoods be
(The world still turns around)
As life continues
And with the lyrics and rhymes, I bring you
I'm telling you strife you been through
Might make your heart feel colder than Pingu
I stand in a place
Contemplating distant memories
You have never seen so many tear drops on a face
But a voice in my brain keeps telling me
They build me up to break me down
But the world still turns around
They build me up to break me down
But the world still turns around and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round
The world still turns around and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round
The world still turns around
Yeah, as the world spins on its axis
I feel trapped in a box like matchsticks
But I've got the UK head over heels
Like gymnastics on a mat practising back-flips
But they wanna seal
My career like silicon mastic
Some days when I wake
I tell myself I'm feeling fantastic
'Cause whatever occurs
Time won't stop the earth still turns
Every lesson I've learnt, I reckon
It's worth the pain and seconds of hurt
So as the world rotates
Oscillates and floats through space
A never ending cycles occurin'
A carousel that won't stop turning
They build me up to break me down
But the world still turns around
They build me up to break me down
But the world still turns around and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round
The world still turns around and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round
The world still turns around
They wanna build me up to break me down
They show love when I was hard up
And now I'm coming up
It seems they wanna break me down
They wanna build me up to break me down
They show love when I was heard up
But now I'm coming up
It seems they wanna break me down
They build me up to break me down
But the world still turns around
They build me up to break me down
But the world still turns around and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round
The world still turns around and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round
But the world still turns around and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round
The world still turns around and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round
The world still turns around
