Yeah yeah
They want 64 bars, I want 64 whips and yards
And I don’t care who they think that they are
Cause I will laugh at your staff as I carve them in half
I’m positive like H.I.V
I’ll bury emcees on SB.TV
So deep that they'll only have the reaper to meet
Say hello to the demons for me
And don’t think cause I’ve just been signed that I still ain't the most venomous grime emcee
I catalysed half of the scene into making songs with the hearts on their sleeve
So tell your whole team that I’m iller
You can’t see me like an evening with Cilla
That’s why I find them hard to believe
When they're talking greased like they're larger than me
If you ain't heard of me, thats perjury
None of them men couldn't verbally murder me
I’ll break in my doctors surgery
Ransack the drugs and then get arrested for burglary
It’s quite sick, cause only 6 years ago, none of them cunts had ever heard of me
I’m like a cigarette I’ll hurt you internally
But they can’t put me down, they keep burnin’ me
So fuck anyone hatin’ on me
I’m great in the scene and that’s blatant to see
I’ll kill you off like an ancient disease
My name spread like the great plague of the streets
You can’t turn the tables on me
There ain't an MC I'm unable to beat
So take my advice and wisely retreat
Devlin the biggest emcee this side of the sea
Minute and a half, I’ll bury anybody with the lyrics in my bars
Ripping you in half because I’m lyrically advanced
If you look up in the sky I’ll be sitting on the stars
I’m walking down the road to Zion, like Damien Marley and Nas
All your staff will get scarred if we ever cross paths
It ain't long like giraffes
You will be laying on your arse and asking where the fuck you are
I’m the captain, you can’t take charge of my craft
You’re in deep with Jim if you can’t swim
I won’t even throw you a raft
Scream SOS I’ll just laugh ’cause I’m back with a bang, like a bomb in Iraq
With a crash and a flash and a spark
I’ll creep in the night like a thief in the dark
So anybody reckoning they're levelling with Devlin
Will get left fucked like their features are feminine
‘Cause you can’t keep up with the pace and the rate that I keep on developing
So investigate like Kojak, and you'll know that
I injected the whole grime scene with a shot of adrenaline
Now watch me resurrect grime from the dead again
‘Cause whether you like me is irrelevant
You can’t deny talent when it's evident
I’m off the scales of an inadequate measurement
Most of these men have got a vocal impediment
My names Devs, I’m a local degenerate
So I drink and I smoke for the hell of it
Play the beat and I’ll carry on deadin' it
This is war that's 64 from Devlin!
