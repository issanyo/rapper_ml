Reality is sinister
People welcome you with open arms then piss on ya
Every snake is similar
They take enjoyment from the pain that they administer
And lifes realities couldn't be more vivider
Reality is sinister
People welcome you with open arms then piss on ya
Every snake is similar
They take enjoyment from the pain that they administer
And lifes realities couldn't be more vivider

[Verse 1]

I understand that life's never tranquil, hard to handle
Place of a whole life time of hardships
So why be thankful? I can't manouver like they've tied my ankles
The bottom line is that life's a shambles
So let's get it straight, the only way to make papes is getting read away on bait estates
Predetermined fate
These kids don't plan to be shotters and scam plotters and armed robbers
The systems proper got us round the bollocks, under scrutiny and penniless usually
Nar this ain't half the place it used to be
Due to the way the country is run so we need to start a mutiny
Urban decay has left scars on our community, visible for all to see
The MP's are stealing money off of you and me, professional criminals
Wonder why we turn to gun and knife crime
Cause all of the hard earned cash that they deprive us of in a life time

[Verse 2]

The Bible said that man is equal
If that's the case then why am I fucking broke and why are they flossing with papes
And when we go to get dough they just throw us in jail
It's like they don't want us to succeed, they just want us to fail
I'm trapped within the beasts mouth and I've got to get out
I don't know honestly how but I won't let him swallow me down
I'm not like these clowns that follow around mugs that can't spit
You daft prick, you start shit, you're hollow in a dark ditch
The way they've got us entrapped and in prison
Nobody actually listens, cracks in the system too many bad decisions
And they're impairing what we see in our vision
You'll get transferred to a different division, with no precision
Holding hidden talents that I've written and my main decision was to remain consistent and make a difference
(Gonna make a difference, that's the last thing I need)
(Hahaha, Tales From The Crypt!)

[Verse 3]

Backstabbers hate the progress
They're writing bars with no sense, Devz has got them so tense
Locked under pressure in the chains of the system
They can't compete, they talk big but their frames inconsistent
Reality is sinister that's one thing I know
So lay low upon these roads where the gun fingers blow
So keep your weed in your balls and if they're shotting and there's need for a tool
So keep it close to you, do what you're suppose to do
Cause life don't supply guidelines
When you leave school, you work these cold streets and the high rise
So take a look at my life
Not in school anymore, I'm like damn look how the time flies
I'm nearly a man and if I don't blow, I'ma get as near as I can
And if I do blow, I'll come back and appear with the grands
I see heads in the manor, keep on cheering for mans
Cause that's who we do it for
Best know that OT we do it raw
