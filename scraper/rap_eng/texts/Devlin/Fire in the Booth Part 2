[Verse 1]
Check, big up Danny Weed on this one
Okay
Yeah

Bypass the white shark I'll bite you in half then snap on the life guarder's right arm
I'm a psycho I smile and apply charm while I really feel like strikin' em by large
If you never again appeared I don't think many would care but I'm a life form with my bars
Not prison lyrics written touch wood
I don't wanna jinx shit but I'm spitting and I'm trying hard
To yet again affirm no fella in your firm couldn't better me I'll burn every body in the booth, anybody want a turn?
I bet that you would
But me, I don't endorse men from the hood, half as good
I just laugh I'm [?] when I blast [?]
The road looks clear on the path I took
Now let me step it up a gear when I start then look
If you ain't be familiarised, my name's Devs
And I've been on my grind a long time
In the fog, when I'm Phileas high
I don't die like spirit inside 'cause every lyric I write has got infinity life
I don't give a shit about their critical eyes
It's take what I want now, criminal mind
Baitface, I'mma take anything in my sight
There's something in the rhythm and it's giving me life
The resurrection of Christ? Not quite
Freeze me till my race turns out bright
Guess so that officially means that I could sleep for a million weeks and then rise
When I see F-I-T I'm that guy
They're going on B-A-D then get shy
Who is it? D-E-V the mad guy
Kitty man, love titty and fat thighs
You can smile again this world is mine again
No time to play the timing's great
I waited for brighter days to light the game and now they can't fight the flame
I hear a lot of wannabe yanks from U.K
Trap 'em in a bando 'til they lose weight
Force him to smoke what he sell everyday
To people's children been led astray
We pray upon the weak in this world for the need to excel
So bun bein' weak I'm a beast you can tell
I'm telling men I wanna [?] a girl
Do a queef then smell when I read to myself in a region I dwell
Dream to myself in the freedom I sell [?]
Never let a man lead you and tell
Great lies to achieve what he needs for himself
The future's in the grip of your palm
And you wouldn't wanna rip it apart
Only mad men live in the past, it's 2008
Ain't that I'm scared to ask
I maintain the charade for a state of calm
Dedicate time to creative art
Like Kurt Cobain when he played guitar
I'll sing [?] while I lay in the bath and just drift
[?] if I flow like magic
Between the heavenly dream and this challenge [?] that men can't savage
Sabotage or blast and attack it
Out of your reach Armstrong couldn't grab it
Third eye's open like the doors on the carriage
When the highway men ask what's yours let 'em have it

[Verse 2]
Check check check
1,2
Big up to Rookie Beats on the net man, big beats
Listen
Yeah, it's the

Oh I'm a screw-up
I think it's time I grew up
'Cause now I look so old that I could pass for 82 up
And I ain't even 30 yet, oh what a dirty sket
Life turned out to be, hope don't desert me yet
Why don't you come for me until my maker comes for me
'Cause being the one to beat is taxing me, H.M.R.C
They're all hunting me
I'm sitting here uncomfortably, sipping on my cup of tea
Thinking "who, fucking me?"
The cheek of it, I don't even know these cats
Roll up on your cul-de-sac, smack you with a golden plaque
I'll turn the show to ash till I can see that Charlie's sweatin'
It's like I'm cooking crack on camera in some grimey setting
Yeah you know it's that, guy that makes almighty efforts
I'll serve a pint inside a shot glass, defying measures
Play me back, like podcasts and find treasures
Holy Grime was just some bread for all you blind beggars
I highly reckon that tiny seconds are worth their weight in gold
And once they've gone you won't get 'em just like the Phoenix feathers
Count your blessings, 'fore they count you out
Like a boxer that got dropped just like a fart inside your mouth
You arse lickers, half spitters
Thinkin' that you're hard hitters, biggest here period
That's why they're wearing large knickers
Love to Uncle, love to Char, love to Vic
Love to Young Spray, E.G.A we made it through this shit
Like Andy Dufresne, crawling through these sewer pipes
Tryna find the bluer sky, Devlin is do or die
But I'm so lazy I might choose death
Only joking, who's next?
I can see the future in my sight
The booth is now alight
It's like I can't believe they're legally
Charlie Sloth invited me to try ignite the BBC
There ain't to fighting me, no blighting me, no beating me
I think these guys fancy me, that's why they always speak of me
I set this fire in a booth part, 2
I thought I'd nice you with a new spark
Got everybody like "that white man is too dark"
You're bloody right, and this year's a new start
I said, I set this fire in a booth part, 2
I thought I'd nice you with a new spark
Got everybody like "that pale face is too dark"
You're fucking right, and this year's a new start

[Verse 3]
We're gonna go again
Check
Big up PEZ OTB on this one
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Devlin, Charlie Sloth
Listen

It's your best MCs worst nightmare
The devilish white breh that don't quite care and I'm right here
Yo Slothy, when I bring the horror like Shotty
They're insignificant, it's quite clear
Nobody, can make me look sloppy
This shit is my whole damn life not a hobby
I was in the bits tryna grind for a bobby
Now I'm on the mic everybody's gettin' bodied
Arses ask me if I still feel relevant
Relevant? What's relevant? Shottin' heroin?
Murder? Lies? Cash over anything?
Kids don't be silly with your life, be intelligent
And acquire what you need and more
Television is a weapon and they're winning a war
It's all Towie and Geordie Shore, it's not cool to be thick
Nor to be a Northern whore
Adore and implore me I'm sure that I couldn't give a shit anymore
You ain't even wanna spit on the floor
When I'm finished, yeah bringing the raw
Or shop round, there ain't none bigger in store
I've been around, from the A.M. check my M.O
Building blocks like Ed Sheeran with Lego
Traipse in the field no life in the meadows
Nighttime runnin' with the grimiest fellows
I hear echos
I feel as though I've lived 20 lives already, I ain't sure
Goes so quick, I was told don't blink so I didn't for a minute and my eyes got sore
Bellies of yellow I feel like like mental
Chat wet like Marti Pellow and what for
That's why I'm on a level and the sun won't settle on my soul when I slip and I slide from the tour
Problem child with a red bow-tie
Givin' 'em what for, the pit with locked jaw, I clamp when I bite
Givin' 'em lots more than gas when I write
Lyrically top draw, dismantling mics
Sound mechanic, dem man just sound mechanic
I'll bring a wave that'll drown the planet
When I'm playing with the flame and grab it
Get burned in a state of panic
I was made erratic, Private Pyle, full metal jacket
Loopy and wild
Charlie, stay in the booth for too long and you'll be grey like me
It's the radiation of a nuclear star
You'll see the file
Anything I want I wanna choose to [?]
Casting a spell, it's the voodoo child
Salem, I'm in a witch hunt no trial
The only justice I know is poetical
They don't wanna hype me? Go let em all, I'll get em all
I'm highly incredible, I'm making a circle spherical
More substance when I tell 'em all
You wanna ride with Devs, you'll need a miracle
Bun your life for bling, it's so unethical
You know what? F 'em all
I'll start my own terraform where some people were never born
