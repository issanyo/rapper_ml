Yeah, it's Devilz.. Tales From The Crypt
Big up Deeperman, big up Wretch 32, big up Ghetts

Tales From The Crypt

[Hook - Devlin]

When the curtain comes across I wanna know that i've lived life
I don't wanna have no regrets and I hope that I've earned respect
Off my family and people around me
When the curtain comes across I wanna know that i've lived life
I don't wanna have no regrets and I hope that I've earned respect
Off my family and people around me

[Verse 1 - Devlin]

Say one day that I don't wake up and the Lord opens the gates up
Then I wanna know that I lived my life and my kids and wife
Grown up and leave the bits behind, yeah that's right I wanna move away
Smoke weed all day and let the music play
I've got bars that will leave you confused for days
And will I be here next year, who's to say?
Left school one year still I ain't got a job
Guess that makes me a bum now
I can't even look at my mum now
Gotta make money though somehow
Living in the streets where it's run down
Sell weed til the sun's down but I wanna give Mumsy summit to be proud of
Once you're in the hood it's pretty hard getting out of
A life of depression just leads to aggression

[Hook - Devlin]

When the curtain comes across I wanna know that i've lived life
I don't wanna have no regrets and I hope that I've earned respect
Off my family and people around me
When the curtain comes across I wanna know that i've lived life
I don't wanna have no regrets and I hope that I've earned respect
Off my family and people around me

[Verse 2 - Wretch 32]

I've got a son now so when I die I'll still be here
It's that real but I'm still prepared
I stack P's til I leave him scared but don't cry for me son, man
I'm your Earth, you're my Sun man
Kai, so together we make rain
I can't front like grief ain't pain
Huh, but be strong rep the surname
But by this time you should have had kids of your own and your kids should have grown
And you're sitting on chrome but that's if I play my part
And invest in the roads but you can't follow my footsteps
You gotta be that good Wretch, cause the road ain't easy
But when I do you'll be me but when it's time come see me


[Hook - Devlin]

When the curtain comes across I wanna know that i've lived life
I don't wanna have no regrets and I hope that I've earned respect
Off my family and people around me
When the curtain comes across I wanna know that i've lived life
I don't wanna have no regrets and I hope that I've earned respect
Off my family and people around me

[Verse 3 - Deeperman]

So when I move on, I wanna be remembered
I wanna have answered all the questions that needed answers
I wanna leave memories, for my friends and my family
So when I'm here I'll make the most of whats around me
Grimey streets and girls that won't go down on me
Back to the manor where I ain't got a pound on me
Don't make marks in the circles surrounding me
But I'm still here living alone, I'm not dead so I'm proving them wrong
I bring tears to your eyes with the bars that I use in my song
And only God knows the movement I'm on
So when I do die, don't cry for me
Roll up a big zute, take a draw and blow it to the sky for me
Reminise for a moment, let the weed circulate and then get high with me

[Hook - Devlin]

When the curtain comes across I wanna know that i've lived life
I don't wanna have no regrets and I hope that I've earned respect
Off my family and people around me
When the curtain comes across I wanna know that i've lived life
I don't wanna have no regrets and I hope that I've earned respect
Off my family and people around me

[Verse 4 - Ghetts]

25 years from now, I can't imagine what the future holds
But I refuse to be broke
Like, not enough plans too many hopes
Hopefully I'm healthy cause I usually smoke
How many more years can my body take, when I'm old will my body ache?
Only God knows
I don't wanna look back and be ashamed, wanna turn back time like that can be arranged
Some olders wanna do exactly the same so who's happy?
Lifes fast like a Ducatti but if you rally it's like getting new fanny
Hustle hard til  my last breath enough even if they think I'm doolally
My brains full of good memories, bad ones too but it could of been empty
I'll take care of my kids like a true daddy

[Hook - Devlin]

When the curtain comes across I wanna know that i've lived life
I don't wanna have no regrets and I hope that I've earned respect
Off my family and people around me
When the curtain comes across I wanna know that i've lived life
I don't wanna have no regrets and I hope that I've earned respect
Off my family and people around me
