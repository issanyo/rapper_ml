[Music/Lyric - Marcus Ehlin]

From the grave I'm starting to remember
All that lies you told me
The broken promises, all falseness and deceits
All those things are suddenly clear, I'm waking up again
I see your face in front of mine, and I will never forgive you

Can't you see I'm out of pain, you can't hurt me anymore
My inner demons are all angels, taking care of me

In my dreams my fears still haunts me, but they lost control
They all smile, death has found it's way, they have lost control

"I am home, buried deep
I found home, down below"

Heavens angels stopped to pray, my soul is ever lost
I found my sanctum here on earth, a few feet down below
Heavens angels sings no more, I found my home

All the beauty you possessed, all the things that you once were
It has died, it's buried deep, inside my burning heart
Nothing remains the same, I am waking up again
Your face has started to fade, but I will never forgive you
