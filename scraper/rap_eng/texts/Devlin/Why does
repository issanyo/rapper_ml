[Verse 1]
I just wanna know what I'm here for what I smoke weed for what I drink beer for
Why I keep struggling and why I cry tears for it's like I'm trapped in a tug of war
When we die it's the end there's nothing more, I've got so many friends but I'm lonely
Cause when I'm laying in my bed and I think in my head it's like no one will actually know me
I'm not saying that I wanna pass away, but I wanna know why I'm here today
And does it matter what we do its like taking control
One thing I know when we're waiting to go, fuck taking it slow
Life ain't breaking my soul, cause I got more compassion than hatred on road
Still I don't know why I'm here so the equation ain't solved, no


[Hook]
Why does the world spin round, why does the world turn round and why do birds fly in the sky and why do we walk on the ground like why does the world spin round?
Yeah, Why does the world spin round, why does the world turn round and why do birds fly in the sky and why do we walk on the ground like why does the world spin round?


[Verse 2]
I find it hard to believe in religion, the bibles like Chinese whispers
Written by man and passed on over time, so every other time everybody adds another little line
I'm not trying in the least to be disrespecting, nah I'm just saying that i can't accept it
If you ask the church they'll probably tell you that my words are septic I'm a hell-bound sceptic
I'm not trying to be nasty or evil, I'm just trying to find a purpose for people
And if you misunderstood me then listen back
If god made the world in 7 days, whats he been doing since then just kicking back?
Don't see me as taking the piss
I'm naturally human it's natural why I'm questioning this I just wanna know why do we live?


[Hook]


[Verse 3]
They're never gonna change the bits, and they're never gonna change the kids
They're watching MTV cribs then they look where they live
Now their seeing exhaustion so now they're taking your money without caution
Put you in a tight space like contortion and taking your portion
A rising stone broaden, so next thing you know they'll be facing the warden
It seems to go round and round, swings and roundabouts scales and grams
Kids still wear hand-me-downs, so just imagine what they'd do for a thousand pounds
Murderers, killings these children are willing they're moving with villains their pockets keep filling in multiple sinnings they're taking your winnings to ease the pain like penicillin
