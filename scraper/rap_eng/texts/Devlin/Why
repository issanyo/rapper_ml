I just wanna know what im here for what i smoke weed for what i drink beer for, why i keep struggling and why i cry tears for its like im trapped in a tug of war, when we die its the end theres nothing more, ive got so many friends but i'm lonely, but when im layin in my bed and i think in my head no one will actually know me. Im not sayin that i wanna pass away, but i just wanna know why im here today, and does it matter what we do its like takin control, one thing i know when were waitin to go, fuck takin it slow, life ain't breakin my soul, cause i got more compassion than hatred on road, still i don't know why im here so the equasion ain't solved, no

I find it hard to belive in religion, the bibles like chinese whispers, written by man and passed on over time, so every other time everybody adds another little line, im not tryin in the least to be disrepectin, nah im just sayin that i can't accept it, if you ask the church they'll probably tell you that my words are septic im a hell bound skeptic. Im not tryin to be nasty or evil, im just tryin to find a purpose for people and if you misunderstood me then listen back, if god made the world in 7 days, whats he been doin then just kickin back, don't see me as takin the piss, im natrually human its natrual why im questioning this i just wanna know why do we live?
