[Intro]
Devlin...Community Outcast...And this one's for all the characters that have been forgotten in the present time...

[Verse 1]
I represent for the jobless, that have been made redundant
That have got four kids and don't know how to fund em'
Ever since the wife and her husband
Both lost their jobs at the office in london
Now they feel financially trapped
Now they're locked with rats in a dindgy old dungeon
Take this young father of two
Signing on and the government says that his family are spongers
He's like "Damn man
We ain't got a penny or a pound
Let alone money for milk
And nappies and trainers and jumpers"
He got taken off site cause it's cheaper
To pay Europeans to labour in numbers
How's he gonna take care of his youngers?

[Hook]
I represent for the people
Let down by a nation
And left in the streets where it's evil
Little kids surrounded by knives and heroin needles
I represent for the people
Let down by a nation
And left on the streets where it's evil
Community outcast, cold, tired and feeble

[Verse 2]
I represent for the homeless
Let down by a nation
More interested in war and invasion
When children are sleeping at railway stations
No home or money
They wish they could phone their mummy
To put a hot meal in their tummy
So at night when the temperature drops
I'm asking you, remember what you got
These kids go home to a cardboard box
They're the sole survivors
Warming their hands with a flickering flame of their lighters
All their life they've been frightened
Walk the streets with their head down
Knowing deep down inside that they've really been let down
By a country that's crippled
And I thought mankind was supposed to be civil

[Hook]
I represent for the people
Let down by a nation
And left in the streets where it's evil
Little kids surrounded by knives and heroin needles
I represent for the people
Let down by a nation
And left on the streets where it's evil
Community outcast, cold, tired and feeble

[Verse 3]
I represent single Mums
All alone on their own trying to put food in the mouths of her two sons
And the fathers gone, there's no cash flow, lack of income
But that's just the way it is
She counts fifteen needles pushing her pram on the way to the lift
And this is where Brown said it's safe to live and raise kids
She finds her way out of the block
With two kids in a pram and a rip and a stain in her top
She goes to sign on just to maintain the little she's got
For her kids sake
They'll never see a decent life
But they can dream and they'll sleep tonight
They've been hung out and left to dry
The kids are in bed, Mums left to cry

[Hook]
I represent for the people
Let down by a nation
And left in the streets where it's evil
Little kids surrounded by knives and heroin needles
I represent for the people
Let down by a nation
And left on the streets where it's evil
Community outcast, cold, tired and feeble

[Verse 4]
I represent for the old folk, that live alone
No family or kids at home
And all he wants is someone to speak to but nobody thinks to phone
Sits at home in the dark, no electric
Since his wife passed, he can't accept it
He feels isolated, neglected
And now his council flats infested
So he goes to the shop for his papers
With a stick and he falls in the mud
The people around him all pulled him up
But to him that's just a reminder
He's old and he's weak with no one to love
I see clouds up above
Another bad day in the diary
An old man one of many
Killed by society, strangled quietly
