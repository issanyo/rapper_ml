Hide far from my life and nearly everything just ain’t the same
These lyrics I’m bringing, I’m giving you insight into the world that I live in
Where you don’t stand up, man up, you will be dead in the city, sinning
I switch my life from an open position
I wanted more than work and still being poor
I don’t need criminologist proving that young men attacked by animals lately
Hand up what you made this for, nothing inside but hatred and war
Who I ever learn from releasement, was that a kick for the door
But I retain composure, now I can’t stop till the sun burns out
Life as you know it is over, I used to run around town
Thinking of scams and puns
Now you see my face on a poster, you must have fool down was a no hover
Or a joker
I call at your vision be the only part that’s made for me
Cause when the sun goes down I gotta be
Content when I lay my head, I lay my head
Until the sun goes down, want to be broken time.,
I run around, I let my heart on my palm and I show you my hand
Cause no matter what happen you won’t ever see me a broken man
My vaco evokes emotions that we make dope when we share round
I can feel the changing power, now life don’t seem so sour
I used to sign on them writings cause I told myself
That I won’t get the work till I work for means one more bloody hour
So, say hello to my ex, still got a whole for a fight in the shower
Times are crazy and my world’s dreams as a baby
Wanted them to think that I want to be the best MC in the whole UK scene
Till the sun goes down imma run this town on Rihanna and Jay-Z
I’m a warrior now, no stopping me now, I’m telling you, take this
I call at your vision be the only part that’s made for me
Cause when the sun goes down I gotta be
Content when I lay my head, I lay my head
Until the sun along rises
The fall of mankind, the change of climates
You find me grinding, this life that I’m in
It’s full of surprises, but you still find the fire
Until the sun along rises
The fall of mankind, the change of climates
You find me grinding, this life that I’m in
It’s full of surprises, but you still find the fire
I call at your vision be the only part that’s made for me
Cause when the sun goes down I gotta be
Content when I lay my head, I lay my head
