[Verse 1: Devlin]
I'll still get the bars in, Devlin I'm marching
Like a soldier serving in Iraq is, now watch me eliminate targets
You should have known to anticipate carnage
Your attitude stinks like an arm pit
I've got bars harder then Arnolds arm is
And no man has got rid of me yet
So I'd say I'm here to stay like a scar is
I ain't immigrating I'm lying and waiting
And debating, just what I'm going to be taking, I ain't faking
So don't be mistaken, like I've gone soft for the ratings
I'll take you up to the top of the dirtiest, derelict block and then throw you over the railings
And the only motive was hatred

[Hook]
Has Devlin gone soft, does Devlin think he's bad
Nah he thinks he's at the top
All your bullshit makes me mad, but the drama don't stop
So alarms are ringing off, cus with the bars I'm still allot
I've been as dark as dark has got
And now I'm marching through the fog

[Verse 2]
Tarantula, creep all over the beat
Gargantuan and get under my feet I'll stamp on ya
I won't ramp on ya
The games like a letter and I just took my stamp honour
And if dinner ain't served then I'll back 9 Stella's and stamp on her
And sip on a can while I'm drowning her
While I'm pinning her down as I strangle her
I'm the murkiest white man handler
Till this very day been around here
If I was plotting then I wernt like the sound of ya
You get naughty I get a bit rowdier
Still you won't let them throw back a pound at ya
Don't place me in a box, you cocks
If there's one thing I'm not it's fucking rectangular

[Hook]
Has Devlin gone soft, does Devlin think he's bad
Nah he thinks he's at the top
All your bullshit makes me mad, but the drama don't stop
So alarms are ringing off, cus with the bars I'm still allot
I've been as dark as dark has got
And now I'm marching through the fog

I'm marching through the fog, it's dark and I've been lost
But with the bars I'm still the boss
And now I'm back where I belong, [repeat]

[Verse 3]
Devlin I'm back and I'm harder then nails
I was raised in a place, so foul
With my mates in my pals house wetting up papes on the scales
But now I shoot bars from the mouth
Keep marching them in or keep marching them out
I'll barge you around like a bully in a playground
If you ain't ready for the regime stay down
I'm going hard for the whole U.K. now
I'm harder then granite large, I'm Titanic
In fact make your faculty panic, like a madman acting erratic
With bombs in the basement and straps in the attic
A confrontation would have to be tragic
Like the coppers, when he met Harry Roberts, let him have it

[Hook]
