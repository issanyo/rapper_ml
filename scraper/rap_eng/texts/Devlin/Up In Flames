[Chorus: Labrinth] (x2)
And it's all here for the taking
May the best man walk away, here's
To the strongest, to the bravest
When the roof blows up in flames

(Lesson 1)
[Labrinth]
Cause you know we're gonna burn it down
Cause everybody in here wiling out
Now ain't nobody walking out of here
Without their clothes on the wrong way round
So what you gonna do right now?
(Party like a mother-motherfucker)
(We're goin') Right to the top floor
(Now there's) Smoke in the window
(And we're) Turning the heat up
(Till it's) Burning the roof off
(Haha) World domination
No limitations
Talking about M-M-M-My Generation

[Link: Labrinth]
It's about that time to take a U-turn my DJ
So without further ado won't you put the replay

[Verse 2: Devlin]
Devlin, Out-Takers
(Don't look down)
Me and Lab in the lab
Too mad, crack down, be a man
Make threats?
Yes, then we see 'em out
You don't really want DV about
I'm straight but I'm coming out
Now I'm running in got them running out
Anyone who thinks they can muck about
Must be on a hard job plucking out
(Come on-oooon
When the boys come out to play ahh yeah ahh)
You better put your guards up, guards up
(Ahh, you best on your way)
(You certainly won't be coming to my house for tea)
So act like you don't know
Back on the on the track with a cold flow
Smack any track and the road knows
It's actual facts, no Roald Dahl
I'm back to back with my solos
An absolute no go, bozo
Both your personas and bars
It was fake, it's imposing a photo
(Oh no)

[Chorus: Labrinth] (x2)

[Verse 3: Tinchy Stryder]
Boss Life Strydes
Fleet Gang
(Good evening, your time starts... now)
Fuck did they think they was dealing with?
Music is in my veins like I'm bleeding hits
Hold it to ransom, kidnap this in the industry
I'm the chosen kid and oh it stinks
Anus flows, I am the shit
We chance with risk, we live on the edge of cliffs
We're brave in the heart, they Jet Li no
We blaze it apart, blatant aim for the heart
Greedy taking your half, hold up Lab let me tell them
That we
(Burn it down, hold it down)
You see me run this
Where's the crown?
Stone cold face, don't deal with frowns
Chasing the dream and it come with pounds
I'm done, I'm ghost for now

[Chorus: Labrinth] (x2)
