[Verse 1 - Ghetts]

I can hear you're in need of a hero
I'm no knight in shining armour
Believe me I'm as greazy as Nino
With the same ego as D-Bo, negro
You can be black, white, asian, latino
Everyone bleeds homes, I'll make you leave home
Fuck your bodyweight, nobodies safe
Not even a seed, I'll be eager to squeeze
I'm the reason [?]
The closer you get to receiving a beating
But it's ok if leave with the P's king
If you don't pay well...
Let's just say you weren't left that way
I'll collect that pay, when head back straight
Don't think i won't let a strap rain, I'm insane

[Chorus - Ghetts]

I used to play baddies and goodies
Now i wear bally's and hoodies
[?] Start going on aggy in the bookies
I'll bust a 4-5 Cali on a pussy!
Go ahead be a hero
By the time the police get here i'll be gone with the wind
I don't care where as long as im far from the bing

[Verse 2 - Devlin]

We've had beef in the same proximity
You moved to our estate but not civilly
You kept hyping up nah thats a liberty
Now i watch you pray for your hero
When the fingers are feeling fidgety
It's dirty devils and i'm breezing differently
Never say that my bars lack credibility
This is real life, no play or nativity
I'll put something inside you
Like a female that's 9 months deep in fertility
There's no hero, I'm the cold breeze in ya earhole
Soul that sneaks through the window
And then i'll be gone when the wind blows
In the blink of an eye and i hope one day
That i'll stumble across what i'm seeking to find
Probably another murder tonight

[Chorus - Ghetts]

I used to play baddies and goodies
Now i wear bally's and hoodies
[?] Start going on aggy in the bookies
I'll bust a 4-5 Cali on a pussy!
Go ahead be a hero
By the time the police get here i'll be gone with the wind
I don't care where as long as im far from the bing

[Verse 3 - Ghetts]

Triple Nine could take a little time
My face won't be visualised
I know London like a city guide
I can [?] it's been a busy night
I'm getting cheddar so rats wanna nibble mine
But i'm the gorilla type
Banana clips don't pick a fight
I won't ever be a victim of cizitens arrest
Round here those who are innocent are blind
Round here those who are in a scent of death
See no and here no evil
Even though they're so legal
Nobody wants tugs at the front door
Especially a hero...
When you look through the keyhole
Don't ask what i've come for
You better know I ain't gonna knock once more

[Chorus - Ghetts]

I used to play baddies and goodies
Now i wear bally's and hoodies
[?] Start going on aggy in the bookies
I'll bust a 4-5 Cali on a pussy!
Go ahead be a hero
By the time the police get here i'll be gone with the wind
I don't care where as long as im far from the bing
