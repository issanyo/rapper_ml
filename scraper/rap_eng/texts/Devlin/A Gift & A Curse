[Hook: Chasing Grace]
You want to see the best of me
You gotta see the worst of me
You wanna see the gift of me
You gotta see the curse of me
You gotta see the world I've seen
You gotta see the dreams I dream
Well, nobody sees me, no
The rise and fall

[Verse 1: Devlin]
You gotta see what I've seen
Be where I've been to achieve these dreams
Be a teen on the UK streets
Scared for your life, getting chased through the night
And the world's getting ruthless
You got a red eye, everybody's on a high
And the matters got stupid, so have I
All you ever do is bring me down
I'm living up to the name you gave me tonight
And I am silent, that's why everybody wants me to live a lie
I ain't sure being thirty, I come from a place where the good die young
And the bad die when is their time, they say this to the face
Just know that my head's inside two worlds so my new name's two face

[Hook: Chasing Grace]
You want to see the best of me
You gotta see the worst of me
You wanna see the gift of me
You gotta see the curse of me
You gotta see the world I've seen
You gotta see the dreams I dream
Well, nobody sees me, no
The rise and fall

[Verse 2: Devlin]
I showed you the gift, let me show you the curse
You get big, then vultures emerge
And so called friends try pulling your bird
Once again, I gotta roll in the curb
And I try to live my life with morals
But find myself in many more quarrels
So I seek salvation in words
So many votes, a gift and a curse
The reason I flourished and grew
Might be the reason I feel malnourished and blue
I felt pain in the world
My arteries run through the chambers of hell
All I know is from an young man's view
I've seen some things so amazing in this world
Sometimes the grass is greener
Sometimes is quite hard to tell

[Hook: Chasing Grace]
You want to see the best of me
You gotta see the worst of me
You wanna see the gift of me
You gotta see the curse of me
You gotta see the world I've seen
You gotta see the dreams I dream
Well, nobody sees me any more
The rise and fall

[Bridge: Chasing Grace]
Head in the sky, but my hands on the floor
Hard, but this night, will survive through this storm
You gotta see the world I've seen
You gotta see the dreams I dream
But nobody sees me at all, the rise and fall
