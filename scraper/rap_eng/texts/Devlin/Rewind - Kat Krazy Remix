Verse 1 (Devlin)

When the sky breaks it rains

So just let the h2o splash upon the graves of all the souls I used to know

But now have passed away

Men say that time can heal a situation

But this pain is not a passing phase

Now I'm curious, how many years a heart can ache

Feel like a minotaur, meandering this darkend place

Trying to find a way, to maybe find the light of day

If I could rewind then I'd re-live my life again

And sit and hold my nans hands, while she felt the pain

And say hello to old mates, behind the pearly gates

Given the chance to glance back at my childish phase

I'd try and smile the way i smiled, just like a child again

Before i had to sat goodbye to anybody

And the loved ones I've lost, all had life within their bodies

My side was less lonely then

You wanna cry, well come and hold me then

I think I need the blessing of some holy men

Chorus (Diane)

'Cause everything is different now

I'd really like to tell you how

How I wanted you here by my side

I know what I said, but I lied

It looked like I laughed, but I cried

But I wish I could push rewind

Verse 2 (Devlin)

If I had minutes on my hand, just like a time piece

I'd turn the clocks back and maybe try to find peace

As well as my i.d, so rewind me

Just like a video cassette cause I'm upset that I ain't seen

Some faces in a while, just apparitions in my dream

That ends abruptly when they try to hug me through the screen

Of smoke that's engulfing me

Like the coastline with its high tide

And you can see the sands and the oceans meet

No one told me when this ride began to hold my seat

Time flies like emmet brown was in the drivers seat

You talk of irony, well now I'm lonley but I'm searching for my privacy

This life won't comply with me

I think I need some dead relatives, either side of me

To keep me company and guide me through the library

Of never ending stories full of lies and deceit

Hi ho silver, lone ranger riding to the beat

Chorus (Diane)

'Cause everything is different now

I'd really like to tell you how

How I wanted you here by my side

I know what I said, but I lied

It looked like I laughed, but I cried

But I wish I could push rewind

Verse 3 (Devlin)

If I could rewind time to its slowest

I'd look at life at its highest and its lowest

So I could maybe try to recollect what made me who I am

Besides a poet, besides a poet

Chorus(Diane)

'Cause everything is different now

I'd really like to tell you how

How I wanted you here by my side

I know what I said, but I lied

It looked like I laughed, but I cried

But I wish I could push rewind
