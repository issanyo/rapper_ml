In 5 years time, I've come along way since school days
I was in the bad books always if I wern't at the head masters
Then mugs'll be facing the walls in the hallways
I spat bars in the D.O the only thing that kept me strong than
Them same roads that feds be on, & back then if we did a crime
Hear the sirens & like lets be gone
Damn!
Since they never guess a lot has changed, no it ain't no school games
Then I've got a name
And Visually I've seen a lot of pain & back then I let beef slide
But, I'm not ashamed

I was only a kid then, I didn't have no access to a big black
Stick then, now I might run up on your boys & stick them, snap 'em
Like stick men with a stick bigger than big ben

Came from the bottom to the top I'm from a place where the kids
Do rocks at the bottom of the blocks pushing cds' like drugs
Got mix tape money in my socks
Laugh? Ye say its' funny is it not, mugs would of been flopped & its'
Been a whole year still waiting for your mix tape to drop so don't
Mistake the plot

Yo' Im glad I came from the bottom to the top cause back then you didn't want to know
If I can say that I did it on my own, I'm glad I stuck to the path I chose
Yo' Im glad I came from the bottom to the top cause back then you didn't want to know
If I can say that I did it on my own, I'm glad I stuck to the path I chose

I've been from temptations
I flavored to rings the music they sing savor since them off laughin'
I started in trap blocks in Barking, derelict property with the walls caped in shit
Them days ya taking a risk went through a glass wall
Cut my veins in my wrist I was lucky that my main arteries got missed
Then the hospital pierced with more than just one stitch
& They say the game is no referee that er' coulda' been the death of me
Now I've got a build of a deficit
17 with big dreams like a roll I've ever been

I've got hearts like I've never seen
Seems impossible
Seen where I've come from
Now I'm uncrossable
Money in abundance
Skanks and crazed gunmen
Screaming out London

And i put in 4 years hard writin' they put in more time biting and yeah back then i was frightened
I'm killing off the titans
I'm king of the seas like poseidon
I looked up to the mans in the scene
When double 03 when I was 13
My favorite Mc's tables are turned
They ain't got nothing on me
Come and see

Yo' Im glad I came from the bottom to the top cause back then you didn't want to know
If I can say that I did it on my own, I'm glad I stuck to the path I chose
Yo' Im glad I came from the bottom to the top cause back then you didn't want to know
If I can say that I did it on my own, I'm glad I stuck to the path I chose

I remember days they didn't know my name
Now I'm bait & I only got myself to blame but I don't want
A nice watch or chain you can keep your fame
It's O.T to the grave then back again

Yea I've just lost my job
So, back to the roads
Selling weed again
He's selling white again
They're selling crack again
I've got ya back again
Pure drug packaging

Didn't think when I was 12 or 13 the whole scene
Would show respect when they heard me glad I started
Early now I'm gonna make the whole scene prefer me
They could hate but they couldn't unnerved me
I'm fixated with making the papers
Rolling with Out Takers with all yeh stakers
Now ye can't break us
Even god forsakes as I watch all the haters

Yo' Im glad I came from the bottom to the top cause back then you didn't want to know
If I can say that I did it on my own, I'm glad I stuck to the path i chose
Yo' Im glad I came from the bottom to the top cause back then you didn't want to know
