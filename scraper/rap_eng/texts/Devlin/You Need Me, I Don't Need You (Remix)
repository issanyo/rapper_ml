[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I still got a rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the most jokes, in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flow's developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
I do it for the hell of it
Ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women and then I packaged the image
Put in some content and I then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rappping, back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
X2
You need me

[Verse 2: Wretch 32]
I said you need 3 man I don't need 2
Not none of ya, unorthodox runner up
In my own gear like I'm stepping on a double clutch
No brakes, cut them up, the tyres stay screeching
Now I've found out being odd ain't even
I qualified for everything, long straight season
It's not a dilemma king, got a straight queening
You are what you eat, that's something to believe in
MC with the mic is MC dinner time
Now I'm feeling gassed, like, MC give me light
I didn't even have to do a disco rap
I bet I still end up with a Sisqó plaque
This is what happens when your gift is talent
And all you imagined exists, imagine
I never drop shit and I came from the back end
Now I've got the game in my hand, I'mma smash it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Devlin]
You need me, but I dont need you
D-E-V-L-I-N Ed and 32
Lyrically more capable to break 'em all
I won't have to amputate a lower limb to make them fall
Like autumn, check my post mortem
The game passed away upon the day I came and killed it for this fortune
I don't mean money, I mean luck
But now the clock's aviated
Everybody's time's up
Nothing's what I had and everything's what I gave
Like a sprinter near the finish line fighting for his place
Keep your diamonds and your chains
I can walk for any manner, any time of day and stay safe
Cause I get respected
While they get detested
Tell the truth there ain't nobody that done what Devs did
If you ain't on the tune or Eminem or 5'9
You ain't competition just a fish you're tryna bite a line

[Hook]
