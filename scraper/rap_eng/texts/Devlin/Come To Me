Emptiness my true love
Forever by my side
We ride the winds of death together
As it always has been
I'm longing for your cold embrace
"You whisper in my ear
Come to me
I am the only one, my love
Can't you see?
We have been together since the dawn of time
Forever we will be"
Call my name, I'll be there
Just for you
I'll be waiting, all alone
Just for you
Emptiness my true love
Close and by my side
We will stand eternal forever
As we always has done
I know you're longing too
"You whisper in my ear
Come to me
I am the only one, my love
Can't you see?
We have been together since the dawn of time
Forever we will be'as one"
