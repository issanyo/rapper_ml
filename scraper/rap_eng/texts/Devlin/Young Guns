[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
They call me young gun like I was a pistol in the primary
Speaking codes no binary
Irony, is that I don’t have a beautiful mind at all
I’m not tired at all
There’s no time to pause
Deep thought, with my feet sore from walking
Not a lot of money for a cheap Porsche
Though I don’t drive but I’m known by the guys
That are designed to make you go hype
Like Devlin & Grim with the chilling, chilling
Bring Yasmin for the singing, killing
And I’m keeping the melody where it better be
I’m deadly and readily burning within the evergreen of enemies
Higher than a feather with Amphetamines
Only my head top could be ahead of me
Voice hoarse but guess what? It’s never Ketamine
Making noise from Brent Cross
Head in the hedge tops
Giving up my soul again for the guest spot
Four young guns in London
When we’re coming up

[Hook: Yasmin]
And the feeling of thunder
Storming from my hunger
And I’m travelling higher
Should we wake up the fire?
That’s why they call me a young gun
And now my name is getting bigger
Press the music like a trigger
Every young gun
And now my field just looking brighter
Never stops cause I’ma fight
Every young gun

[Verse 2: Griminal]
Yeah, me and Devlin young gunning
Skunk bunning, delete you with one button
If you don't know somebody best tell them
I turn their head red like Ed Sheeran
I already went heaven, let's get them
I'll better them in 10 seconds
Since I got a holla back like Gwen Steffans
Follow that because I'm trend setting
(?) you get better instead of gettin' the message
I put in less of the effort
I'm still better than most
Come around try bread, all you'll be getting is toast
I've been ten out of ten from eleven years old
(?) but I left him alone
I'm back for the title like I'm living at home
See me at the O2, no gas ting(?)
Know that I'm coming up next like Yasmin

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Devlin]
Young guns
I’m a young gun like a brand new weapon
I'm outstanding (?) and tell them what I reckon
To be a part of the arsenal present
You'd have to be better than Devlin, Yasmin, Griminal and Edders
So in that case forget it
If you don't make the cut like a radio edit
You'll get left beheaded then deaded
When Devs takes you out like a direct debit
One, I runaway for a minute of two
But now I'm back in the booth
I got ‘em all pissed like I poured Cognac on the tune
I ain't nobody's sun cause I stand on the moon
Young guns full of class A lines that'll heighten your mood (?)
Like chasin’ spirals with a spoon
You're not safe like a baby inside of the womb
Every time we arrive in the room

[Hook]
