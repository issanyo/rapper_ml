Verse 1
I remember when I was twelve years old
No worries in my brain with a pound in my pocket
And a chest full of smoke
I remember all the chordies we drove
We used to play football all day and use jumpers for goalposts
And throw egg yolks at windows to wind up the old folks
Started learning about the birds and the bees
So there's birds from my class on their knees behind trees
My favourite MC was Sharkey Major
Way before I hit one double O three, Temptation, Kiss 100, or Flava
Get off from school and tape N.A.S.T.I.E on Deja
92.3 but let's skip forward in time
Seven years down the line and it seems the spotlights on me
Sometimes I still wish that I was still twelve or thirteen

Chorus
Life can pass you buy, just watch how fast it flies
1989's when I started mine, now I'm like 'what happened to the time?
Life can pass you buy, just watch how fast it flies
1989's when I started mine, now I'm like 'what happened to the time?

Verse 2
15: Bag of weed, bag of beers in the park
Duckin' out from Feds in the dark
Then we appear with grass stains up and down my legs and arms
And with a fresh beer clenched in my palm
16: My bars are different class
I've been rolling with Dogz and Glamour and Shotz for a year
I've been steppin' up fast
I guess I got around in the bits
I was selling bags of bud and Tales from the Crypt
I met Ghetts when I was 14, lost touch
By 16, I'd linked up with Ghetts again
Rolling with The Movement and started doing sets for them
Mercston, Scorcher, Unique and Wretch and 'em
2006, I was 17 when I finished my first solo CD
But this time there's an album in the midst

Chorus

Verse 3
By the time I hit 17, I was the coldest younger on the scene
With bars you never heard and flow you never seen
Before I come around it was 'cock it and shoot'
MC's being cocky and rude, then I moved to some deep concepts in my tunes
Monitor my brain waves, tell me if I'm crazed but I think the games changed
And MCs are opening doors in the same ways
As I did when I was a kid, I'm... radio waves
And now I'm paving the way for a fatal display
Might blaze in a haze till I'm dazed then wave a grenade in your face
17 with bars that I regulate and generate pace
I'm only scared of who my enemies face

Chorus

Verse 4
19: Showing strength in the booth
Now it's time to prove what Devlin can do
From the very first time I ever crept on a tune
I've immensely improved, the ascendance is due
Original spitter, not remnants of you
Swear I can see success in my view
Crazy what letters in a sentence can do
Cause my lyrics are the only thing sending me through
Kanye called me a gangster rapper; I'm not a gangster rapper
Devs, I just spit it real
You're an MC like C difficile
I look skinny cause I keep on missing meals
I'll get cold like you know how frigid feels
No children, sticking them rigid still
I guess my life's fucked up but I'm only nineteen and I've got a lot of living still

Chorus
