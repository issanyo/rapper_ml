[Verse 1: Jagga]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home to you,
Soot in my bones and earth in my boots
Wearing this beard and fur on me too
My body moves every time I make a move
But then you lay me down
Wash away the pain and the anger from
You cool me down you
You chase the demons out
You put me in perspective and you sort me out
You sort me out

[Hook]
Don't you turn on me, keep on the light
While I'm away, know that you're on my mind (oh)
I'm coming home, now I got you in my sights
Keep on the light for me, keep on the light (oh)
Don't you turn on me, keep on the light
While I'm away, know that you're on my mind (oh)
I'm coming home, now I got you in my sights
Keep on the light for me, keep on the light

[Verse 2: Devlin]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Too many moons ago, I grabbed my bags and I tied my boots to go
And wherever I roamed, let the truth be told, I felt I was never at home
Like a young drummer, trying to make a impact on a musical note
My refusal to joke or quit just lifted my crew from the ropes
So keep on a light for a man who don't chat shit with the mic in his hand,
I ain't lost, but I feel as though I might need a sign to explain where I am
Let the underground hold me down til the day that I lay in a box underground
I'm still around, if you turned on me then there wouldn't be an urban scene

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Devlin]
Have they turned on the guy already?
Even though my 64's so heavy,
Even though they've seen so many get buried
Leave on the light like a star in the night
And I'm guiding the game home
Hitchhiking a ride with my rhymes at the main road
It's time that I take hold
It's as if I was ready to climax

[Bridge: Jagga]
I'm coming closer
I'm coming back again
It's been a long time
And nothing remains the same

[Hook]
