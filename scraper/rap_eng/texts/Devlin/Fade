[Music/Lyric - Marcus Ehlin]

Come rain, come fire, bring thy wrath down on me
In the shadows of night I lie hidden away from thee

"Let thy life fade away
Feel thy soul fall astray
Into oblivion, come and die with me"

Alone in my keep, alone in my dreams reality
I forge my destiny, I wait for the grave to ruin my sanity

Carving deeper and deeper each day
My flesh, it seems so strange
Lost in my world of beliefs and fantasies
Tempting me with it's burning eyes
Let's be one, let's walk together, embrace me with thy cold
... Hmm, I'm only losing my skin...
