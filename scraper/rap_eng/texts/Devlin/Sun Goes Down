[Verse 1: Devlin]
I had to fight for my life, and nearly everything in it
This ain't just lyrics I’m bringing, I’m giving you insight into a world that I live in
Where if you don’t stand up, man up, you might as well be dead in the city that you sit in
I switched my life from an awkward position, I wanted more than working and still being poor
I don’t need criminologists proving that young men have acted like animals daily
Ain't that what you made this for, nothing inside but hatred and war
All I ever learn from policemen, was how to kick through a door
But I retain composure, now I can’t stop 'til the sun burns out
Life as you know it is over, I used to run around town
Thinking of scams and plans
Now you see my face on a poster, you must have thought that I was a no-hoper
Or a joker

[Chorus: Katy B]
I can't let your vision be
The only part that’s made for me
Cause when the sun goes down I gotta be
Content when I lay my head, I lay my head

[Verse 2: Devlin]
Until the sun goes down, on every broken town that I'm rolling around
I'll have my heart on my palm and I show you my hand
Cause no matter what happened you won’t ever see me a broken man
My faculty throws them rations then we make dough when we share it around
I can feel a change in power, now life don’t seem so sour
I used to sign on then ride on when I told myself
That I weren't gonna work 'til I'm old for means to an end one more bloody hour
So, say hello to my ex boss he's still getting up at half five for a shower
Times are crazy in my wild this dream is a baby
I never did think that I would have been the best MC in the whole UK scene
'Til the sun goes down I'mma run this town like Rihanna and Jay-Z
There's no stopping me now, I’m a warrior now, I’m telling you, take heed

[Hook: Katy B]

[Verse 3: Devlin]
Until the sun no longer rises
The fall of mankind, the change of climates
You'll find me grinding, this life that I’m in
It’s full of surprises, but you'll still find them fighting
Until the sun no longer rises
The fall of mankind, the change of climates
You'll find me grinding, this life that I’m in
It’s full of surprises, but you'll still find them fighting

[Hook: Katy B]
