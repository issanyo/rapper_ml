[Hook:]
We're all part of the moving picture
We're all part of the moving picture
We're all part of the moving picture
We're all part of the moving picture

[Verse 1:]
Stay still while I finish the portrait
You are part of the picture now
Everybodys got roles to play
Inside of my picture house
The film premiere of life events that would pick me now
Somebody better sit me down
I'm too direct when I'm making a stand
Those who watched from afar
Thought the clock was a'fast
Those who watched me advance know how far that I've come from the past
Now this motion picture, ocean's bigger, I'm way too fast
You supported me in the awkward scenes, now you're part of the cast

[Hook:]
We're all part of the moving picture
We're all part of the moving picture
We're all part of the moving picture
We're all part of the moving picture

[Verse 2:]
This goes for the fans
Who stood by me from the day one
From tales of the crypt
The art of rolling and all that I've done
Bud, sweat and beers to here
It feels like I've already won
But if I had more luck, but now looks like the fortune the one
Thanks for the fans that followed me
And helped me in building a colony
You showed more fight than mars
The war God from roman mythology
Forget what the cameras capture
Because I'm the main character here
But believe me, I ain't actor
I'm just trying to write the next chapter

[Hook:]
We're all part of the moving picture
We're all part of the moving picture
We're all part of the moving picture
We're all part of the moving picture

[Verse 3:]
Thank you to everyone that played their part
And taking me from the bottom to the middle
To somewhere near the top
Cause now you're all part of the cast (and the clock don't stop)
The last few years of my life
Have gone too quick
Pick from the bits and dangle with the life inside
A life full of paper, power and glyphs
I come from the real world, still I'm not sure what planet this is
I don't really feel well, I'm sick inside of insanity's grip
Make an action film for this
Leaving the drama, finding the grip
The lights below, I could be a father
But then I gave birth from this
Now you're a part of the picture
You got an insight into the scripture
You get it
My job here is done roll the end credits
Big love to every single one of my fans
And everyone who bought the tickets to one of my shows
Everyone that bought one of my CDs
Every download of any of my songs
Not about the mixtapes
