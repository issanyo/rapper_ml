[Intro: Devilin]
Let your hair down in London City
Everybody just keep moving with me
Let your hair down in London City
Everybody just keep moving with me

[Refrain: Devlin]
Bud, sweat and beers!
And tonight we're in London city

[Verse 1: Devlin]
I'm on the A13 on the way to the city
Where the lights are bright
With some boys that like to fight
I'm leaning, out the window smoking a spliffy
Through the wind in my eyes, like tears that I cry
Getting high on the essence of life
Cause tonight we're in London city
And I got bout' four hundred wit' me
Fifteen minutes ago we left Barking
Now we're approaching the city and we're laughing
Wanna hit a restaurant first cause I'm starving
Eat well for the start of emptying glasses
This is London city
The best city in the world when everybodys not shanking
And blasting, young men moving to music and females
Shaking their asses

[Chorus: Devlin]
Let your hair down in London City
Everybody just keep moving with me
Just keep dancing with me, just keep rolling with me
Let your hair down in London City
Everybody just keep moving with me
Just keep dancing with me, just keep rolling with me

[Verse 2: Devlin]
Alright, I've finished my plate
Now I'm walking out the restaurant lighting up a cigarette and then I pass half to my mate
Many clubs and bars await
We're gonna drink and dance till it's late
And my name is Bait
So a lotta young ladies wanna glance at my face
While they got a glass in their hand and a wiggle in their arse and their waist
It's the O.T show
Sexy ladies who wind down low
And if ya get approached by a bloke, that smells of weed smoke
Don't act like you don't wanna know
Cause we got the city on smash
As the strobe lights flash all I do is drink more champs And spend more cash London city no match

[Chorus: Devlin]
Let your hair down in London City
Everybody just keep moving with me
Just keep dancing with me, just keep rolling with me
Let your hair down in London City
Everybody just keep moving with me
Just keep dancing with me, just keep rolling with me

[Verse 3: Devlin]
As the night comes to a closure I'm far from sober, but
I carry on drinking like a soldier, even when the night
Club's over
It's three in the morning and I still look smart but
I'm far from a poser
I'm sporting, Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, Lyle & Scott
I'm nineteen with more greys than my Dad's got and your girls still trying to watch
Well I guess my face just lights up the spots
And now I'm pissed up running in the road, staggering
Looking for a cab back to Dagenham to kick back and
Cotch
With this sexy blue eyed brunette girl that I got
Well a night in the capital it was more than a lot
London City just bop

[Chorus: Devlin]
Let your hair down in London City
Everybody just keep moving with me
Just keep dancing with me, just keep rolling with me
Let your hair down in London City
Everybody just keep moving with me
Just keep dancing with me, just keep rolling with me

[Outro: Devlin]
London City just bop
Let your hair down in London City
