[Verse 1: Ghetts]
You don't wanna see me when it's midnight
I'll flick my flick knife, shank him 6 times
I ain't ramping, I run up in a camp with a gun up in my pants
Last man standing
Come through blasting a magnum
Kill more than half of your mandem
Everybodies targets I'm blasting at random
I'm like bag dem, put em in a casket and dash dem
I won't stop till everybody's yards are abandoned
I got niggas from Plaistow, Stratford
Ilford, Barking and Dagenham
I'm the one starting the action
Just to spark a reaction
Can't stay calm in a clash, man
Suck your mum ain't something I can take
I caught a nigga skylarking and acting
And started barking and ramping

[Hook: Ghetts]
I buss 1, buss 2, buss 3
I buss 4, buss 5, buss 6
I buss 7, buss 8, buss 9
I buss 10, I buss skeng
I buss 1, buss 2, buss 3
I buss 4, buss 5, buss 6
I buss 7, buss 8, buss 9
I buss 10, I buss skeng

[Verse 2: Devlin]
From Barking and Dagenham to E13
Seen some grimey streets where kids decide to squeeze
Flick knife up your sleeve, metal pipe in your jeans
Flick knife in your spleen, metal pipe in your teeth
The grimier streets outside of the East
And I'll iron out a crease if you're lying through your teeth
I'm not trying to be beat, have you flying out your seat
When they're firing the heat, have you lying in a heap
I'm from Dagenham D block where crack and B shots
Are moving like rocks in slingshots
I feel like I'm living in Fort Knox, where big Glocks
Release more shots and leave you with more than sore spots
Youll be lucky if you get your jaw rocked and jewellery pawned off
Your bird gets slapped and storms off
Tell him "you're a pussy, you was born soft"
I'll be in the back of the motor when it pulls off

[Hook: Ghetts]
I buss 1, buss 2, buss 3
I buss 4, buss 5, buss 6
I buss 7, buss 8, buss 9
I buss 10, I buss skeng
I buss 1, buss 2, buss 3
I buss 4, buss 5, buss 6
I buss 7, buss 8, buss 9
I buss 10, I buss skeng

[Verse 3: Ghetts]
I'm on firing guns that ain't got no safety
I'll buss on a dirty date with a 38
Make a man see them pearly gates, it won't phase me
When I pull it out, I ain't gonna put it back in without letting a bullet out
I don't give a fuck who's looking out
If I weren't gonna do shit, I wouldn't have took it out
I'm fully down, why should I pussy out?
I'll run up in a pussy's house
Get his mum, spread her legs, stick it in her pussy, ouch
Oh, that's fully foul
I seen niggas like oh god
That nigga's like oh dog
Letting off's no prob
Young strapped and I just don't give a fuck
And I ain't got no job
What? Man put money on my head
I’m ready to buss like there’s a honey in my bed
I get gully with a bucky in the vest
Straight duppying the set
Another mums in a stress
Wishing her son was home studying instead
I dont wanna kill nobody
But man just run up on my cuzzy in the ends
So now it's a payback ting, watch when I spray dat ting

[Hook: Ghetts]
