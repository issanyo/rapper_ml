[Verse 1]
I was sat at the bar deep in a trance I just arrived from 'Nam
But I'll play this show and I feel like shit and I'll make these people dance
Until I'm parched, tryna get a drink, barmaid walked past
I'm like raa she's gotta be the prettiest member of staff by far
When I've played this show and it's live
I'ma find that girl that I liked and see if I can catch her vibes
But it's now getting packed inside so I grab this mic and I'm not even a fraction shy
Cos I'm the actual guy, stay with me and find out what it's like

[Hook]
I can never leave you're always tempting me to stay
And judge me if you see me and I'm tipsy and it's late
Flagging down a taxi in a backstreet in Spain
Cause I can never leave you're always tempting me to stay

[Verse 2]
The show got bun and now I feel like I'm dying
I swear that I've got broken lungs
I'm lying down backstage on a sofa
Tryna catch my breath and I'm slumped
But don't think for a sec that I've died my death
Get back on the 'Yac and the rum
And it's done, now I'm flying again
I got a snout in my hand again and I'm drunk
And I found that pretty little thing I was eyeing up right behind of the junk
As it all transpires she don't live far from the place that I call my slum
Look into my eyes, I wanna stay another night or two
So I might you only live once
Cancel my flight, I need more time in the sun

[Hook]
I can never leave you're always tempting me to stay
And judge me if you see me and I'm tipsy and it's late
Flagging down a taxi in a backstreet in Spain
Cause I can never leave you're always tempting me to stay

[Verse 3]
Ahh shit, I'm still out in Maga
When I should have gone back to the manor
But I got on so well with you all that I stayed for a week with Term
And I had a extraordinary time in the morning light somewhere in the sky with Gazza
Susan, Dan, Jordy and man like Bill anything don't matter
Why the hell would I wanna go home
I'm right here in this Spaniard city
Sitting next to an England rose
Whiteboy wasted come on it's Jimmy
In London it's freezing cold
More grief, more beef on the roads
A reality check so I know if I left him out it'd be silly

[Hook]
I can never leave you're always tempting me to stay
And judge me if you see me and I'm tipsy and it's late
Flagging down a taxi in a backstreet in Spain
Cause I can never leave you're always tempting me to stay
