[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
There must be some way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion here
Mmm I can't get no relief
This is Monday,drink more wine
Come man dig my earth
None will never lone the line
No one out of this earth

[Verse 1: Devlin]
Yeah
I see jokers on my left, thieves upon my right
You’d find me in the middle if I picked a different life
Before my name started tripling in size
But I’m still showing signs all attributed to mine
In the pitch black, it’s too cold
I’m all alone take me back to the roads
I had to roam to get here and I’ll hitch back
Get a cab to my mother’s house
See my old man and grab a six pack
Tell my brother I love him
And give him something that will see him through the hard times
What’s a brother for?
When I’m sick of this life I see
It has to be my family who lift me off the floor
Make sense of all the madness in a world full of money
Full of tears, full of war
I was a plowman and worked from the earth up
Save your wine for the entrepreneurs

[Hook: Ed Sheeran & (Devlin in brackets)]
Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl (Like a failed man I worked from the earth up)
Two riders were approaching
And the wind begins to howl (Cause your world is the same as mine)

[Verse 2: Devlin]
Pour more blood in your cup
Take a sip full of sin and let your taste buds savour the buzz
The flavour of an ill-mannered nature
That lingers on as animals in all of us
Trying to fight for the right to live a life
But some will never win though
That’s why they live a lie
I don’t think I’ll ever win
All of this is anything
When I die I hope a brother’s at my side
There’s no trap door, or get out clause
The world can be your oyster or a set of jail doors
You’ve seen mine, I think it’s time I see yours
I bet you that we’ve been scarred by the same swords
So we are not so unalike
Apart from the fact I live my life in the light and now I’m trapped in it
The way I feel within a few years time
I might have a couple kids and just forget I ever wrote lyrics

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind begins to howl

[Verse 3: Devlin]
Take away the treasure of a man
Convinced that he holds heaven in his hands
Even though I ain’t religious I’m a little superstitious
Maybe there is a promised land
But will I make it or not is a different matter
I’ve been a joker, I’ve been a thief, I’ve been a rapper
I’ve been the only enemy that I can never beat
Give me a piece of mind upon a platinum platter

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
