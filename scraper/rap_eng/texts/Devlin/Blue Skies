[Verse 1]
Seventeen years old when the streets were cold
Running 'round in circles with thieves and thugs
Only lady I loved was Mumz until I got deep involved with a girl that stole my soul
Her breath filled up my lungs and my hand was her's to hold
I ain't never felt this, so I might be a little selfish
But I can't say that I love you yet I don't want no lies to be told
But then lo and behold the words were spurted and the lines were merging
Now I love you more than you even know

[Hook]
You don't need me no more now your heart is jaded
She, knew me through and through too well to ever love me
You don't need me no more now your heart is jaded
She, knew me through and through too well to ever love me

[Verse 2]
Inseparable, now my love's unmeasurable
Until I got a name and fame and blew up inside this game I weren't Devs at all
Just James, but James was Jimmy and Jimmy was busy
Making songs like London City spending nights in a hundred cities
And ladies called me out and that's when you caught me out
I ain't never seen pain like it and to know it was me that applied it
Made me sick to the bones why would I wanna hurt my sidekick
The girl that would ride with me die with me and saw more inside of me
And believed in me and what I could be
When I nearly stopped my writing you told me to keep on fighting
I wish I would have fought for you half as much as I've fought for this
The industry's an illusion how the hell did I fall for tricks
Paused I'm pissed
(Silence)
With a head full of awkwardness

[Hook]
You don't need me no more now your heart is jaded
She, knew me through and through too well to ever love me
You don't need me no more now your heart is jaded
She, knew me through and through too well to ever love me

[Verse 3]
I can't describe in words the days and nights it hurts life's a blur
They say that in life we learn, I learnt the hard way
I lost my love and my soulmate and my best compadré
I could have killed myself for being so blazé now it's heartache
To know that you're with some kid that don't love you like I did
Like I do, like I will to the grave excuse the way I behaved
But now I'm a slave to my own past
I just backtrack but you've grown fast
And I hope that hope lasts because bad dreams in a broke glass don't count for much
I need your hand to touch, I'm scared that I won't ever get that
Again just random sluts that I don't care for
They're the reason that I'm standing here for so therefore
It's my fault that I'm down on my luck and I'm stuck

[Hook]
You don't need me no more now your heart is jaded
She, knew me through and through too well to ever love me
You don't need me no more now your heart is jaded
She, knew me through and through too well to ever love me

[Outro]
No you don't need me
No love you don't need me
