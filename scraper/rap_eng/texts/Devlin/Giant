[Hook]

Got a feeling that the earths gonna shake tonight
Got a feeling the'll run when they see the light
Everybody better move when he starts to fight
Make way, make way for the giant

Stand up
Stand up, stand up, stand up
Put your bopping hands up, hands up
I'm tryna get my grands up, grands up
Everybody stand up

[Verse: 1]
I've got this feeling when I stand up
I'll have to bend my neck so my cranium don't touch the ceiling
I'm defiant, call me Andre the giant
Hell of a monster of a man
But my tongues the only weapon I'm conceiling
Wanna know why I'm so huge? Because my lyrics are mass appealing
I'm metaphorically massive
But stick thin through, due to the lack of food I'm eating
My size and shape's deceiving
You better start to hide your face
Because whenever I ride the bass I'm causing seismic quakes this evening
I'm an Ogre, thought I told ya, I ain't no big friendly giant
And this ain't David and Goliath, so go to war and you won't triumph
With your slingshot I think not, it's time that you retire
Devs arose from the fire to acquire, a status and position that is higher
Yeah my life has been quite frantic
That's why I make sure that mycantics are gigantic
So make sure u keep it locked like M.I.5
When your listening through the wire
Contest and consequences will be dire

[Hook]

Stand up
Got a feeling that the earths gonna shake tonight
Got a feeling the'll run when they see the light
Everybody better move when he starts to fight
Make way, make way for the giant
Got a feeling that the earths gonna shake tonight
Got a feeling the'll run when they see the light
Everybody better make a move when he starts to fight
Make way, make way for the giant

[Verse: 2]

For too many years now
I've been underground like a prehistoric fossil
But this god sent aposols to colossal not to be
Splashing cash and popping bottles
Because my rhymes are astronomical
Their lines are nothing but comical
Quite frankly bloody diabolical (Geez)
I guess my size is overwhelming
You don't possess the capability to fight monsters like Van-Helsing
Because im massive
Every syllable, every metaphor, every passage
I'll be the oversized savage, like the croc in lake placid (RAHHH)
I'll sweep u off your feet just like white water rapids time
To bins thought like jack or consequences will be tragic
But this ain't fairy tale magic (NOO)
I'll force you to resign just like a poor old poor mechanics
Who compose as you like
Thats why I'm the giant round the mic
In a business where u can't afford to panic
And now it seems like the time has become a virtue
But its worth the wait
I'll place my size 10 on the curb
And then till the earth will shake till the day im in a box
I dont deserve a break

[Hook]

Got a feeling that the earths gonna shake tonight
Got a feeling the'll run when they see the light
Everybody better move when he starts to fight
Make way, make way for the giant
Got a feeling that the earths gonna shake tonight
Got a feeling the'll run when they see the light
Everybody better move when he starts to fight
Make way, make way for the giant
Oh oh oh stand up now .... yeah oh oh oh

Stand up
Stand up, stand up, stand up
Put your bopping hands up, hands up
I'm tryna get my grands up, grands up
Everybody stand up, stand up stand up
