(Verse)
Every mum loves their son
Remember that the next time you’re loading up the gun
Cock it back, make it throw in and you run
Breaking them and turn them holy at the sun
Then the Lord, Jesus and Mary Magdalen
But our mom’s mind is below imagining
The subjects I’m tackling, left to cry tears when I scream, see this really happening
Every young soul that’s killed in the field
Never perish to the hating pull to his own
This rap tool to his home, till his own home
To leave the marker on this first wounds talk broke
You can never really hurt one person
Only damage everything they ever know
So next time you see red, think slow
Before you strip another woman of her soul

(Hook)
We are just children trying to cope in
We crawl to our feet and we try to run
Won’t be one of the fallen
Our love has just begun
In the end we’re all just flash and blood, all set and done
We’re all our mother’s sons

(Verse)
Whether you’re rich or poor
Live like a king or you’re sleeping all alone, cold
Concrete floor, summer in the city
Nearly every man has a mother he adores
But when the time comes to leave the nest
We have to learn to fly alone and fight our own wars
For the trouble that will always be stars
Some man’s right, but some close doors
Today is like I don’t know what to say
Looking in the face the whole human race
In dismay I think that we forget
Who we evolved from the first drowns of DNA
Creating many types of men
Think as a fire as the men in different shades
Opinions, measurements, shapes
And though, within our mother’s eyes we’ll be great

(Hook)
We are just children trying to cope in
We crawl to our feet and we try to run
Won’t be one of the fallen
Our love has just begun
In the end we’re all just flash and blood, all set and done
We’re all our mother’s sons

(Bridge)
Let me take the opportunity to say
I tell my loved ones I love them every day
Rule children of the planet trying to grow while the minutes slip away
Some try hard and fly for the flip off
Some strawl into glory like it’s faith
But whatever life decides, the car dripping dope if you were to hate

(Hook)
We are just children trying to cope in
We crawl to our feet and we try to run
Won’t be one of the fallen
Our love has just begun
In the end we’re all just flash and blood, all set and done
We’re all our mother’s sons
We are just children trying to cope in
We crawl to our feet and we try to run
Won’t be one of the fallen
Our love has just begun
In the end we’re all just flash and blood, all set and done
We’re all our mother’s sons
