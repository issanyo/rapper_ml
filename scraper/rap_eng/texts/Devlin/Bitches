[Verse 1]
I see men that are bitches (I see)
I should leave them with stitches (I should)
I'm like "leave them, they're fishes" (fuck 'em)
But me da megalodon
I'm a great white shark, too big for the pond
Stones, sticks, come on
A lot of men move so wrong
I can't hack it, you little maggots, roll on (roll on)
Get back, stay away from me (stay back)
I gave some men their careers
And they wanna try shitting on me (me)
When I'm Tyson, I'm biting your ears (rah)
For as far as the eye can see
I see men that wanna flex like women
Chat shit behind backs and then shake hands (woah)
Cos they ain't got it in 'em (woah)

[Chorus]
Bitches (bitches)
I see a lot of men that wanna flex like bitches (bitches)
All the fakers, haters, snakes and the snitches (snitches)
Why have grown men gotta act like bitches (bitches)
These bitches
These bitches (these bitches)
Bitches

[Verse 2]
I would have rolled out to the end (you know)
And you wanna hate on me (who me)
I don't need no more new friends
Unless I come across Rachel Green (Rachel Green)
Eyes black like the Thames (yeah)
Fed up of the drama and beef
Why have grown men gotta get feelings
I blame shy FX's beat (one)
Its mad how loud that your actions speak
Poker, I'm sat whilst I'm reading faces
I don't like what I see
They got their eyes on me
Sheep wanna follow a grown men, me
Sleep in the hollows and hang from the trees
I don't like what they're talking, keep walking
Them man can't come around me

[Chorus]
Bitches
I see a lot of men that wanna flex like bitches (bitches)
All the fakers, haters, snakes and the snitches (snitches)
Why have grown men gotta act like bitches (bitches)
These bitches
These bitches (these bitches)
Bitches

[Verse 3]
They say you're not a derogatory term for a female
I'm talking about men that should of been down
And turned out bitch
Peace out
We don't need no snake on the team now
Nor never, swordsmen sever
These fools that leisure
I've got one better
Entire pool in my whole cellar
Chainsaw, call me face or leather
And make your, decisions more wisely
Sweet feeling you're styley
You're all grown ass men
So stop bringing me down like wifey
All these indirects on the net don't send me a threat
Come find me
Cos you know where we are
In Drugnam and in blacked out cars

[Chorus]
You bitches
I see a lot of men that wanna flex like bitches (bitches)
All the fakers, haters, snakes and the snitches (snitches)
Why have grown men gotta act like bitches (bitches)
These bitches
These bitches (these bitches)
Bitches
