[Verse 1]

When I come through they're sweating, like Lee Evans
And when I drop bars yeah the question beckons
Am I coming for that number one slot or will I come second
Of course I won't my styles lethal, just like weapons
I know what I know, don't care what you reckon
I want more dough than David Beckham
My boys blaze zoots and beers we neck 'em off
So you can suck out cause I spit bars on the mic then I duck out
And if I'm in the place then get the fuck out
You come across me blood your lucks out, yeah
And no I'm just not giving up, nar I don't give a fuck
Yeah I'm gonna live it up
So bring your boys an ill hit 'em up
Now pass me the mic, let me rip it up yeah
And you can't get drastic, everybody knows that your fake and your plastic
So please don't come with that wack shit
Sound boy I think you need a new tactic
I'm Devlin yeah I smash it, you'll be getting dashed in the back of the Transit
Cause I've had enough of your antics
Your not a war boy, nar you're a prang bitch
And you don't bang clips, your gay now you don't bang chicks
OK now were gonna make chips
I've had enough of these little fake pricks yeah
And were lunatics, so bring your boys and we'll slew the pricks
Got more style than Ludacris
I'll merk your crew, I'm not new to this
Spray like a Magnum, the worlds deadliest handgun
I've been around son
I'm the quiet type, I'm not a loud one
But if I feel blows, I'm a loud one
And I spray like a mac, fast repeating and black
Automatic and that
I'll make your body movement, erratic and that
I'm more ill than an asthmatic on crack
And I shoot like a shotty, spit bars to your body
Blood I'm not shoddy, my styles fat like Blobby
I'll leave your body curled up in the lobby
Believe that's my hobby
Shoot like a tech, war man will blaze in the neck
We bun them hot bars to the neck
Shoot like a tech, war man will blaze in the neck
We bun them hot bars to the neck yeah
You can't play the hero
This is Cape Fear and yeah I'm De Niro
You must have wax in your ear hole
Told you not to spray with this weirdo
I'm weird because I spit the real shit, stuff you can feel shit
Not about the steal clips
Who says crime never pays, crime kings bling with rings round my ways
What they know about all night parties?
Blazing green at 7 in the morning
With hardly no snout in the zoot
And smoking kills but fuck the warning
Waking up at 8 pm, getting ready then doing it again
Drinking bears, blazing peng
Skanking out till 10 am

[Verse 2]

Bring your boys I'm having 'em hung
Devlin yeah I'm that Dagenham scum
See me and Fats there blazing the zoots
With Joe French and the rest of the crew
The smoke goes through the stairs in the tower
Willsey has to reload every hour
Dagenham streets, cold and sour
If the girls butters don't allow her, nar
Just draw that protection, roll that shit back down you erection
And your girls not Terry, she's ours
And sound boy, your not having one segment
On this microphone I sense tension
Your styles long like your girls extensions
So here's a suggestion, shut your boat 'less I ask you a question
I've got more than the tools of the trade
And I want rings with jewels and just bade
And I wanna go Spain, in the pool with the babes
Sip drinks in the cool and the shade
So I'm gonna start schooling their face
Let 'em know that its wrong to be fooling your mates
I don't care if you rule in your gates
Cuz i'll smash a tool in your face
And sound boy your small in this race
Your just a beginner, blood I'm a winner
And I'm hungry for papes
Want them for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner
And I'm a joker, like Frank Skinner
But if I switch then i'll turn to a killer
I'm Devastate boy, iller for realer
I'm the white beast, i'll be no gorilla
They say I ain't got what it takes
But I spit real though not like the fakes
I'm on plot not leaving a trace
I spit hot, bring heat in the place
Yeah I'm young and I've made some mistakes
But I guess its all trial and error
I'm Devastation, now is my era
So I'm gonna open my file of terror
Now its gonna rain ash from the heavens
Face kicked back while I start the massacre
In the driving seat I'm no passenger
Confidential like Kim Basinger
Yeah and i'll be merk and harrasing ya
Cause you ain't ready for my minions
Low the short change, gonna make the millions
Low the millions, after the trillions
No I didn't have a good home life
Concentrating on me, take a look at your own life
I've gotta flow right
Devastate white boy, I'm my own type
Yeah believe that I'm my own fucking person
MC's I will merk em
It's my time, best role back the curtain
You can tell your boys that ill burn 'em
I'll put a hammer in their sternum
And these swag might men
I've gotta teach and learn 'em
And if you want war, ill merk your crew
Like England merked the Germans
Yeah and you can tell your boys
I'll kidnap, pimp and sell your boys
Cuz you ain't nothing but fakes and snakes
See you on the road, won't give I just take
