[Hook]

I’ll see you
I, I, I, I, I, I made this world for you
I made this world for you
I’ll see you, I, I, I, I, I I made this world for you
I made this world for you

[Devlin - Verse 1]
I look down on this race I created and all I see is violence and hatred
I shake my head as I whizz by in my space ship
The world is like my movie screen, plus 18
Because peace is far and few between
Ever since Eve took the Apple off the snake
Humanity sealed it’s fate and then tragedy laid in wait
Killer tsunamis caused by tectonic plates, changing shape, at the oceans base, releasing explosive rage
I’m just sat here in my burgundy robe observing the globe
Pondering if the life that I created will ever learn to evolve
I filled your oceans full of fish and I put birds in the sky
And everyday you sit and curse on your lives
You ain’t worshipping I
How did you manage to ruin such a beautiful planet?
The turn of the times left my continents and countries ridden with murder and crime
Earthly decline

[Hook]
People look cold like the freezin’ rain
All truth be told, we don’t see the same
People look cold, like the freezin’ rain
Like the freezin’ rain, my son died in vain

I’ll see you
I, I, I, I, I I made this world for you
I made this world for you
I’ll see you, I, I, I, I, I I made this world for you
I made this world for you

[Devlin - Verse 2]
He made the world in seven days and six nights and then he rested on the seventh
Now everybody’s sinnin’, it seems emptier in heaven
Rest In Peace to everyone who lost their lives in Haiti and September the 11th
As well as 7/7
‘Cause I was on the train an hour before
I guess I got a higher purpose in the eyes of the Lord
Who looks down from the sky into the fire and storm
And sees governments in unison like one big global Mafia
They’re paying soldiers for a foe to blow a strap at ya’
From heaven's door watch him maintain the war, to continue selling metal to the masses like Metallica
I feel although a lot of love has been lost
If I was God I’d be cross that my son had to die on the cross, cross, cross
If I was God I’d be cross that my son had to die on the cross

[Hook]
