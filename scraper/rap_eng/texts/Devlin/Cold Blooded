[Verse 1]
I’m a reptile, been left wild with the next style
I spray projectiles that dead men within ten miles
For a bit I’m pensive then I vent vile, lyrics and phlegm bile
I’m sex smiles, this ex-child was born in a red nile
Sex wild, girls on my left and right arm, make Devs hard
But after the foul play, I’m showin' them a red card like Prem stars
Engrave this seat, I’m leavin' a benchmark
And hench scars on popular idols with these death stars

[Hook]
F-U-C-K everythin' I see
All I am is me, that’s all that I can be
If you don’t like me fine, I’ll leave you slaughtered in your seats
I’m tortured in my sleep, I’m haunted by these streets

[Verse 2]
I’m an ex-guy with ten pints of red stripe
With feds at a red lights, on a dead night, with my revs high
Thank God, they sped by when he clocked eyes on the next ride
If they saw what’s lyin' inside my boot, I’m sure I’d get time
I react like an enzyme and defend guys like a mum cuss
I came from the bread line to the big time, I ain’t done trust
I’m tight like a nun’s muff and I make these punks jump
Like they just heard guns dump, I'ma just do me, don’t need no thumbs up

[Hook]
F-U-C-K everythin' I see
All I am is me, that’s all that I can be
If you don’t like me fine, I’ll leave you slaughtered in your seats
I’m tortured in my sleep, I’m haunted by these streets

[Verse 3]
You want raw Devs?
I’ll drag you back inside of your mum with rusty forceps
I love packin' big but wanna be big before death
So big I circle the globe in four steps
You can’t spin me, get left in an infinite vortex
I’m more vexed, men don’t dress like men no more
Girls want rat like their out for the war
Act like a man, get banged in the jaw
I’m that sure
Whoever controls us from their platforms is bad for
Everyone of us
So I just spaz more

[Interlude]
This family blood line, inter-breathing control system of these big families was not just the human thing, it went beyond that into entities that are anything but human

[Verse 4]
TV just lies, they just manipulate the truth
What you need to understand is the Government runs the news
So is it true did William father Kate's baby?
I don’t really think so, if you ask me he don’t like ladies
Could have been Harry, yeah, I bet it was Harry
Fingered a Gary, filled her with Harry
And let XXX marry
I still be the baddy
Think I’m clean, I’ll kill Kim and Aggie
Murder the pally
Little brown-nosed kids in a random rally
Yeah it’s Daggie

[Hook]
F-U-C-K everythin' I see
All I am is me, that’s all that I can be
If you don’t like me fine, I’ll leave you slaughtered in your seats
I’m tortured in my sleep, I’m haunted by these streets
