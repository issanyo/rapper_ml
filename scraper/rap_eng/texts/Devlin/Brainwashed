[Devlin:]
It's D.E.V.- L.I.N your girlfriend thinks I'm handsome
I'll brainwash your mind like Derren Brown or Charlie Manson
You won't suggest I'm random when I take the scene for ransom
And I'm packing out stadiums with the fans singing my anthems
Dirty like Leslie Grantham
This is my manipulation
So forget the speculation on all the trials and tribulations
That I've faced along the way because now I've changed my situation
My names lodged up in your brain just like a blade in an operation
But now their all discussing me in their everyday conversation
Assisting me to spread the word so brace for an invasion
Neurological science I'll give you braincells re-wired
My names Devlin & I'm just tryna gain entry to your mind

[Hook]
I fought up my corner, didn't I warn ya
That one day you'd know my name
A few years older, now I'm singing
Ayo, ayo remember me
Do you, do you remember me!

But now you're being brainwashed
They never knew what my name was
But now you're being brainwashed

[Devlin:]
You better recognize my name just like your family members
My flows so tremendous shining like a thousand embers
We came to take over your town til every man surrenders
And kidnap your vocabulary until my name is all that man remembers
You never knew me when my life was dark and gloomy
But now my life is like a movie starring role yours truly
So familiarize yourself with the cast upon the set
If your unaware of how I'm moving then you ain't heard bars yet
Naah!
I'm Mr fire mic just like David blaine & Paul Mccenna
Hypnotism different frame of mind whenever I pick the pen up
So in the future if you remember any name again
Make a mental note of 6 letters D.E.V.LIN!

[Hook]
I fought up my corner, didn't I warn ya
That one day you'd know my name
A few years older, now I'm singing
Ayo, ayo remember me
Do you, do you remember me!

But now you're being brainwashed
They never knew what my name was
But now you're being brainwashed

D.E.V.L.I.N. Make sure you remember me
D.E.V.L.I.N. Brainwashing your memory
D.E.V.L.I.N. Standing by mentally
Make sure you remember me, make sure you remember me

O.T. Bud, sweat and beers
Now I'm here, now I'm here!
Make sure you remember me, make sure you remember me

[Hook]
I fought up my corner, didn't I warn ya
That one day you'd know my name
A few years older, now I'm singing
Ayo, ayo remember me
Do you, do you remember me!
