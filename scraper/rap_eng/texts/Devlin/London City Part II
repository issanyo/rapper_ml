[Verse 1: Devlin]
I'm on the a406 in a car with a click while I glance at the bits
The city looks dark in the mist so high I forgot who just passed me on this
All I ever did want was a chance to exist
From writing bars up in my bedroom back when I started
I can't explain how it feels when I here em all chanted my shit
A lot of love for the city that I made my name in
When I first hit rinse inside of the grimiest basement
A white chapel under the pavement
Shout out to the fans all over the manors I've played in
You've been amazing, tonight were in London city
But you know I'm on a UK thing

[Hook]
I've gotta show love for the city
I made my career, my name, my money, my fame in London city
You'll still find me in London city
In the grind, hustle and bussle out to every other UK city

[Verse 2: Devlin]
It's funny how time flys
I'm 22 now were in 2012
With the olympics here at our doorstep
Its time to welcome the world
Inside the historic metropolis, some call heaven and some call hell
L O N D O N, you can tell by the way that its spelt
This place is a lone don out for its self
With the streets of manic in grid lock traffic
I think about the things I've managed to achieve in a dream that seemed so graphic
That it must be real
I come through the darkness, signed my deal
With Mikey, Colin and Victor behind the records, I look back at the pictures still

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Devlin]
I've worked all over the capital
North, South, East, West
If you like the citys my wife
I've seen the bitch at her worst and her best
Since my debut video
Life ain't the same in a sense
I'm signed at major events all the time
And more baked than an 8 foot fed with dreads
I moved outta my mums
To a nice little drum and I don't hear sirens sounding when I try sleeping
Just peace when the evening comes
Alot of things have changed
From making London City
At the bottom of the big wheel, Shorditch then Piccadilly
But me I'm the same

[Hook]

Let your hair down in London city
Everybody just keep moving with me
Just keep boucing with me
Just keep rolling with me [x2]
