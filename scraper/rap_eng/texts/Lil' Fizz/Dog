Oh no
No no (Now cause we'll never be)
You're a dog
Why you go and do that
Know it didn't work
You were playin' games on me
You're a dog

[Verse 1: Jhene Aiko]
You thought I was in the dark (No no never me)
Baby boy, from the start (You was trippin)
I was askin questions to see if you was creepin
(For no reason) At all (At all)
I am accusing you of cheatin no matter what you sayin
So irritatin so baby stop the playin

[Hook]
Dog - Tryin run game on me
You're a dog - Thinkin you could cheat on me
You're a dog - Boy you know you lost my trust
You're a dog - And I know its obvious
Dog - Tryin run game on me
You're a dog - Thinkin you could cheat on me
You're a dog - Boy you know you lost my trust

[Bridge]
You were playin games on me
I'm your new enemy

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
I heard you say you were gonna push up on her
I played along boy you think I'm stupid
I'm on point no I don't miss a damn thang
Fed up but Jhene ain't fallin
They all know (But she is my dog, yeah)
I got my friend on you tellin her to call
(You got caught now that you're a dog)

[Verse 3: Lil Fizz]
I'm a D-O-G
From the T-U-G
It's hard tryna be F-I double Z
I'm the Jay Z of my generation
So sick I'm every hospital's number one patient
Girls be killin me with they fantasies
When all I really wanted was the GTD's
Two minutes of conversation then ya outta control
I'm a D-O-G, ain't no changin me

[Verse 4: Jhene Aiko]
You think I didn't know you (You could be doggin me)
Tryna play me for a fool (I'm your new enemy)
(You barked up the wrong tree)
(Now you turned into my enemy)
I planned it all out
I tried to test you
I guess it didn't work
(I'm so, I'm so, I'm so)

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Jhene Aiko]
Tryna run yo game, tryna run yo game on me

You're a dog - And I know its obvious (Ohh I)
Dog - Tryin run game on me (You were tryna test me)
You're a dog - Thinkin you could cheat on me (You were tryna test me yeah)
You're a dog - Boy you know you lost my trust (You were playin games on me)
You're a dog - And I know its obvious

[Outro]
I'm your new enemy yeah
Now because we'll never be
You were tryna test me, I'm so disappointed
You were tryna test me, and I'm so disappointed
You're a dog
You're a dog
