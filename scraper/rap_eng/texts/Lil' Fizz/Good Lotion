[Chorus: Lil Fizz]
Good lotion, good lotion
Get you in the mood like good lotion
Oo girl you wet call you new ocean
All I need is you and that good lotion
I’m inhaling your Vicky secret
Girl I love it when you looking decent
Good lotion
Good lord girl, you stay causing commotion
‘specially when you’re naked in that good lotion

[Verse #1]
Girl I can’t tell if I’m falling for you or you falling for me (falling for me)
Just know that I’m ballin’ so tell your old nigga he out of his league (out of his league)
I never fall for it anyway I just be falling asleep (falling asleep)
Soon as you tell me ‘I love you’ that’s when I fall out of reach
Don’t even know what be happening, I’m fucking bitches on accident
First on my way to the studio then I met you now I’m having it
Man I do numbers, I swear I be so much in Mexican names, I ain’t even asking them
What I’m just calling them, guess I’m just calling them passengers
Ride shotgun to the cars……. Caught one
Pussy smelling like a rose, similar to what I drove
Inhaling your fragrance coz you got a scent a nigga know
Sweet tasting like French toast coz that cinnamon up in your

[Chorus]
Good lotion, good lotion
Get you in the mood like good lotion
Oo girl you wet call you new ocean
All I need is you and that good lotion
I’m inhaling your Vicky secret
Girl I love it when you looking decent
Good lotion
Good lord girl, you stay causing commotion
‘specially when you’re naked in that good lotion

[Verse #2]
All of those circles you’re moving in
You know you’re slick in them Louboutin’s
Smack it or flip it then rub it down you not gon know what to do with it
I’ll have your ass on a P.J, serving me up like a stewardess
Your pussy smelling like peaches and cream no need to be nervous
Girl I’m inhaling your fragrance and its making me faded
I pull out that purple haze drank and now you got me making a baby
I guess I’m just stuck in my song, yeah I’m just smoking is all
And I’m inhaling your fragrance, smell like that Yves Saint Laurent

[Chorus]
Good lotion, good lotion
Get you in the mood like good lotion
Oo girl you wet call you new ocean
All I need is you and that good lotion
I’m inhaling your Vicky secret
Girl I love it when you looking decent
Good lotion
Good lord girl, you stay causing commotion
‘specially when you’re naked in that good lotion
