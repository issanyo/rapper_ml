[Intro:]
I'll be down for you, baby
I'ma ride for you, baby
I will be the one you need
I'll do anything you want me to

[Lil' Fizz:]
Sexy abs
With your hips to match
Apple bottom jeans
With your lil Gucci backpack
Don't stand there
Admire my mac tac

Gift of gab
I never lacked that
In fact
When I whisper in your ears
I see your skin bump up
And the hairs on your arms jump up

I get the same feeling, girl
When I'm by your side
And when we kiss, girl
Our souls collide
I can provide whatever you need
Just holla, girl

[Jhene Aiko:]
Know how you got me
On the line
But I can't stop thinking
All the time

Boy where you be?
Wanna be around you constantly
Give me that
No

Can't stand to go feelin'
Before I'm even
Out the door baby
I wanna keep you there with me

I'm that chick
What?
No doubt

I'm that chick
Up or down
Don't even gotta say a thing
Cause I'll be down

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Oow what you bet
I'll never let
Nobody else ever think
They could come between

What we got between you and me
'Cause baby boo
You got it like that
And ain't no way
I'm holdin' it back
No

'Cause now I got you
And if feels good now
To be with you

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Lil Fizz:]
I ain't tryin' to get in your drawers
I'm a gentleman
I open doors
I'm ready and willin to give you more
Than the dude you was with before

It's automatic, girl
You're the only one I adore
Long walks on the beach by the shore

You was all teeth
When I came home from tour
I came off the plane
With a teddy bear for you

With a card attached telling you "I care for you"
I'll be there for you
Girl, you've proven yourself

I see your heart is with Fizz
Not the cause of my wealth
And you conduct yourself so smooth and classy

You respect Omarion, J Boog and Razz B
They all cosigned you
And gave you thumbs up
That's all I needed

And this verse is summed up
And I'm ready to take you there
I gotta whole lotta love to share
I know you're down for me

[Bridge:]
I will give you anything
And I will do anything

Anything you want
Anything you want

I will give you anything
And I will do anything
Anything you want
Anything you want
