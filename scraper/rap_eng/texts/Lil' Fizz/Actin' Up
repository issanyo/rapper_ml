Yeah
Just let it ride
Check it
She's complicated, it's so frustrating
Sometimes I think that this girl is crazy
Can't explain it, [Incomprehensible]
Screams my name, I can't let her go
First we kiss and then we fight
[Incomprehensible] off the chain every night
Shorty knows what I like
And I can't get it off my mind
Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad
She treats me so damn bad
She's still the best I ever had
That's why she's got me
She's got me actin' up
She's got me actin' up
The way she backs it up
Can't stop actin' up
She's got me actin' up
She's got me actin' up
The way she backs it up
Can't stop actin' up
Infatuated, intoxicated
Got me buggin', gotta love her
I be stressed, I'm such a mess
I'm next to you, makes no sense at all
In the morning, in the evening
Sweating you 'cause I believe
What you give from head to toe
Me and you, girl, let's get it on
Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad
She treats me so damn bad
She's still the best I ever had
That's why she got me
She's got me actin' up
She's got me actin' up
The way she backs it up
Can't stop actin' up
She's got me actin' up
She's got me actin' up
The way she backs it up
Can't stop actin' up
FIZZ
Ay yo, ay yo, the great's is back
What?
Oh no, oh no, it's Fizz in the back
What?
The clock is tickin'
Y'all shouldn't have started slippin'
Puttin' us together, man, what was y'all thinkin'?
Now she got me finin'
Man, she got me thinkin'
The way that thing is shakin'
It's got me double blinkin'
Oh no man, she's so incredible
The way she bring it up and bring it back to the floor, oh
How she acting has got me reacting
If she is somebody's girl
I'm guess Fizz is jacking
Leaving us alone ain't no telling what could happen
All you fellas reppin', Lil' Fizz is packin'
What?
She's got me actin' up
She's got me actin' up
The way she backs it up
Can't stop actin' up
She's got me actin' up
She's got me actin' up
The way she backs it up
Can't stop actin' up
She's got me actin' up
She's got me actin' up
The way she backs it up
Can't stop actin' up
She's got me actin' up
She's got me actin' up
The way she backs it up
Can't stop actin' up
