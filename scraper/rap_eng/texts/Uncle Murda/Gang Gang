(Intro)
Whoa x4
(We Got London On The Track)
Lets go
I only f*** with my
Lets go

(Hook x2)
I only f*** with my
Gang x6
I only ride with my
Gang x6
I only trust my
Gang x6
Get money with my
Gang x6

(Verse 1: Maino)
I only f*** with my gang tho
I ain't really cool with no rap n****'s
And I ain't talkin' no Instagram
And I say boy I get at n****'s
Whole life wild s***
One gun case at the Trump case
Never been on that Fab s***
Like Stevie J aye f*** faye
F*** n****'s in this industry
One verse away from being enemies
One drink from putting hands on'em
I cross n****'s like the letter "t"
Don't treat me like I was no rapper
N****'s know I ain't no actor
First it's the money, then it's the power
Then watch all the b****'s come after
Tell all these n****'s we started a gang
We like NWA
And they still f*** the police
Chopper in back of the Wraith
N****'s like y'all bought the block back
I got the rapper his watch back
We got the city on lock now
I know that these haters won't like that

(Hook x2)
I only f*** with my
Gang x6
I only ride with my
Gang x6
I only trust my
Gang x6
Get money with my
Gang x6

(Verse 2: Uncle Murda)
Get you robbed in the club
Next day go see the plug
Whipped the crips and the bloods
Like 2Pac i'm a thug
Rep Brooklyn like Biggie
Got Baby like yeah I did it
Just did a deal with 50
Move bricks and dope in my city
In the trap like
Whoa x3
Break a whole brick down
Whip it x2
Audemar finna whole brick now
Shots fired we did the shootin'
Shootin' n****'s takin' n****'s cubans
Free my n****'s in the penitentiary
Talkin' Brooklyn then you gotta metion me
Me and Main on some other s***
Streets certified gunned as s***
You Ace from Paid in Full
Get shot now you on some sucker s***
Get your whole gang gang shot
You kissin' her like she ain't a thot
Me and my n****'s gang bang
Though you hit it raw and I hate the box

(Hook x2)
I only f*** with my
Gang x6
I only ride with my
Gang x6
I only trust my
Gang x6
Get money with my
Gang x6
