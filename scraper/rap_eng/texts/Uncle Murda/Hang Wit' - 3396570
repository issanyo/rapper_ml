(Que Banz)
My nigga  ???
She jus want perkys and zans
See the money was part of the plan
Caught me a lick off a scam
Free all my niggas upstate in them gates
Them they got burned in a jam
Don't care bout surveillance
Play tough on the footage
Know why so they shot on the cam
In the kitchen im whipping them gram
(yea woah wait whip it)
Im tryna stretch me a bag
Pour me a six of that drank
Try and come down and I can't
Theses niggas mad and they hate
We move that loud by the plate
I am so high I might faint
