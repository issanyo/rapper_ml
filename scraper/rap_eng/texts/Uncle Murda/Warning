OOOH, I get paper
I ain't playing, I ain't playing
I smack the shit out a hater
They be sayin', they be sayin'
"Murda, you too hard
You NWA
These rappers Chico Debarge"
They be sayin' they going to step to me
OOOH, I wish they would
I'm a 'Menace to Society'
Ask the 'Boyz in tha Hood'
Baking soda beat
Coke flow
OOOH, I got crack
I rob rappers with a gun
Diddy use contracts
She a stripper, she a model
OOOH, she from the hood
Licking on my lollypop
OOOH, she lick it good
They ain't thuggin', they be frontin'
OOOH, it just a gimick
They be rappin' like Li'l Flip
OOOH, that means they finished

The mag is fully loaded
And I got extra ammo
Get it poppin' by myself
OOOH, they callin' me Rambo

Ain't nothing I can't handle

OOOH, they callin' me Bush
There's bodies on top of bodies
Watch that button get pushed
