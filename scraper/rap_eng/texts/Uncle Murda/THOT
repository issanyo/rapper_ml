[Intro: Dios Moreno]
Yeah
I mean, I don't know what to think
I guess

[Hook: Dios Moreno]
I said the girls look so good, but they minds is not ready
I said the girls look so good, but they minds is not ready
God damn, I used to like you
That pussy was tight too
Can't believe I almost wifed you
Found out you was a thot too
What you gotta be a thot for
What you gotta be a thot for
In you, I see a lot more
What you gotta be a thot for
Damn, girl

[Verse 1: Uncle Murda]
Before I took her out, I ain't know who she was
She knew all them niggas poppin' bottles in the club
Ain't wanna believe it, I was in denial
Ain't had no good box like that in a while
Was damn near payin' all her bills
I was keepin' it all the way real
You know I'm tellin' the truth, I'm sippin' that Henny
She ain't call me Murda, let her call me Lenny
Wifey material, she not it
Can't believe I had my kids around that thot bitch
Gotta do better, should've knew better
Now I got a bunch've broads like Hugh Hefner

[Hook: Dios Moreno]
I said the girls look so good, but their minds is not ready
I said the girls look so good, but their minds is not ready
God damn, I used to like you
That pussy was tight too
Can't believe I almost wifed you
Found out you was a thot too
What you gotta be a thot for
What you gotta be a thot for
In you, I see a lot more
What you gotta be a thot for
Damn, girl

[Verse 2: Young M.A]
Every time I see you
I get a bad vibe
Just thinkin' that someone else
In between your thighs
Like, damn, why you gotta be a thottie
My man said he caught the neck right there in the lobby
And I was gonna wife this bitch
Went from "I love you" to "I don't even like this bitch"
I was tryna turn a ho into a house wife
At first, I was tryna see what that mouth like
And I gave you the best of me, now shawty dead to me
Thought she was the one, she turned out to be a Headphanie

[Hook: Dios Moreno]
I said the girls look so good, but their minds is not ready
I said the girls look so good, but their minds is not ready
God damn, I used to like you
That pussy was tight too
Can't believe I almost wifed you
Found out you was a thot too
What you gotta be a thot for
What you gotta be a thot for
In you, I see a lot more
What you gotta be a thot for
Damn, girl
