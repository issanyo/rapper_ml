[Intro: Uncle Murda]
East New York!!!! Broklyn!!!!

[Chorus: DV Alias Khrist] (Uncle Murda)
I gotta have that (OH!) Money when I see you where your stash at?
(Where that stash at?)
Grindin on the block for the green bags (You got the green bags!?)
Run up on you nigga where the cheese at? (Yo where that cheese at?)
Don't make me squeeze that
I gotta have that (I gotta have that!) Money when I see you where your stash at?
(Yo where that stash at?)
Grindin on the block for the green bags (You got the green bags!?)
Run up on you nigga where the cheese at? (Man where that cheese at?)
Don't make me squeeze that, I gotta have that

[Verse One: Uncle Murda]
You gettin money on that block I want in! (I want in)
You make a twenty dollar sale I want ten!
I tried to be nice but, he started riffin
Then he slowed his role up when I start grippin
I gotta get some new shoes for my son
He got twenty pairs so what let's make it twenty one
I'm a get him everything that his daddy never got
Like the new Playstation and the new XBox
So I gotta go and get a couple dudes off the block
Put the mask on pull the thing out let it pop
Run up on a chump like gimme them packs
Man where that cheese at?! Don't make me squeeze that!

[Chorus: DV Alias Khrist] (Uncle Murda)
I gotta have that (OH!) Money when I see you where your stash at?
(Where that stash at?)
Grindin on the block for the green bags (You got the green bags!?)
Run up on you nigga where the cheese at? (Yo where that cheese at?)
Don't make me squeeze that
I gotta have that (I gotta have that!) Money when I see you where your stash at?
(Yo where that stash at?)
Grindin on the block for the green bags (You got the green bags!?)
Run up on you nigga where the cheese at? (Man where that cheese at?)
Don't make me squeeze that, I gotta have that

[Verse Two: Bun B]
Trill hood cat know when you see me
Hood chicks wanna love me hood dudes wanna be me
I give them the heebie geebies when I step on the block
They know I'm diggin in them pockets front on me and get dropped
See I don't care who name on the streets they know that I'm runnin 'em
Talk loud with his homeys catch him solo I'm sonnin him
Look up the block there go Uncle Murda and Bun and 'em
They 'gon pop off homey I don't want none of them
You talk tough you better be ready to back it up
Before we get to actin up y'all 'gon get to packin up
That's real talk cause we ain't playin for the dough
And you can't put that on the Pimp cause man you already know

[Chorus: DV Alias Khrist] (Uncle Murda)
I gotta have that (OH!) Money when I see you where your stash at?
(Where that stash at?)
Grindin on the block for the green bags (You got the green bags!?)
Run up on you nigga where the cheese at? (Yo where that cheese at?)
Don't make me squeeze that
I gotta have that (I gotta have that!) Money when I see you where your stash at?
(Yo where that stash at?)
Grindin on the block for the green bags (You got the green bags!?)
Run up on you nigga where the cheese at? (Man where that cheese at?)
Don't make me squeeze that, I gotta have that

[Verse Three: Busta Rhymes]
Na na na, na na na, na na na!!!!
Ain't no mistakin no fakin I be brakin in
And I be shakin up the buildin because I will be takin in
Every fuckin thing that I'm on, and if it's yours then I want it
I take it like it was mine, then walk around and then flaunt
Then get to fuckin your aunt, cause now she has an obsession
Because your belongings look better when there in my possession
Now heh heh heh heh gotta laugh at this shit cause it's funny
Whenever it comes to money I'm such an irrational think
The type for runnin your house and I rob the stash under sink
And put the gun in your mouth and I'm frownin like somethin was missin
And give a fuck I ain't leavin a pot to pissin

[Chorus: DV Alias Khrist] (Uncle Murda)
I gotta have that (OH!) Money when I see you where your stash at?
(Where that stash at?)
Grindin on the block for the green bags (You got the green bags!?)
Run up on you nigga where the cheese at? (Yo where that cheese at?)
Don't make me squeeze that
I gotta have that (I gotta have that!) Money when I see you where your stash at?
(Yo where that stash at?)
Grindin on the block for the green bags (You got the green bags!?)
Run up on you nigga where the cheese at? (Man where that cheese at?)
Don't make me squeeze that, I gotta have that
