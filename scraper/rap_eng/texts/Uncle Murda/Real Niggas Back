(Intro Greatness)
I want my real niggas back, I brought my real niggas back

(Hook Greatness)
Put the money in the bag like whoa!
Hit the gas in the new Wraith like whoa!
And I know these niggas hate
But I laugh in they face
Got a quarter million dollars on my wrist
Big shit ballin', house in the hills
I bring my real niggas back
I brought the real niggas back
Whatchu tell'em?

Won't hear about niggas robbin' me though (nope nope nope)

(Hook Greatness)
Put the money in the bag like whoa!
