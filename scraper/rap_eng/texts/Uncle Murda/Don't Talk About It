[Intro]
D-C-O. Don't come outside, volume one
G-M-G-A-T-M it's the unit
Reefa on the beat, whoa

[Verse]
All that cocaine residue I left up in the pot got my shawty flippin’
She was tryin’ to cook mashed potatoes for me for dinner with some fried chicken (sorry)
I ain’t get to do the dishes after I cooked up, I was in a rush
I told her clean it up for me, she ain’t got to cook, order Pizza Hut (doorbell hold me down)
Still gamblin’ with my freedom, I ain’t all the way out the mud yet (nope)
My little brother be around bloods, I’m surprised he ain’t turn blood yet (soowoop)
Cops killin’ niggas, niggas killin’ niggas, but we ain’t gettin’ judged equal (DA)
They the ones that got badges on ‘em, they supposed to protect and serve the people (yeah right)
OGs tell me drop out like, “What the fuck a teacher gon’ teach you?” (they right)
Seen fiends tear their arm up looking for a vein to stick it with the needle (damn)
Commissary for my niggas in the feds while a Jewish lawyer fight the case
Killed a nigga, his man got away, he ran so fast he ain’t see my face (pww)
Caught a body and I rapped ‘bout it, I ain’t say his name but I rapped ‘bout it (1,2 1,2)
To me it’s funny, but my mans that I caught the body with don’t be laughing ‘bout it (ha ha ha)
Hundred bands worth of jewelry on, just to stunt on niggas with no destination (whoa)
I don't trust bitches that be like, “What you doing daddy? Text me your location.” (huh?)
Stash box in the Cadillac, I can fit about five Dracos in it
A body dropped in my hood and police tried to get niggas to say I did it (I ain’t do that one)
Back then when I fought a case I used to have to pay my lawyer in the stormers
He don't care what they found in the crib, motherfuckas ain’t have no warrants (no)
Beat the case, beat another case, walking out the courtroom diddy boppin’  (ooouuu)
Had a nickname for my lawyer, used to call him the Jewish Johnnie Cochran
Get me home, keep me out of jail ‘cuz he know he gon’ keep gettin’ checks (ooouuu)
Hold up, nigga, wait a minute, I ain’t finished yet like Nicki’s ex (ooouuu)
Meek Mill voice on the intro, listen little niggas, I’m on fire
Hands down, homie, I did records with 50, JAY Z and Mariah (I'm just sayin’)
I’m the underrated, underdog, but I promise you, my time comin’
50 gave me a bag of money and I ain’t even have to sign nothin’ (whoa)
Everybody have money to they ear, awww man, Jay throwin’ shade (let’s go Hov)
Niggas dying for a hood they mother payin' rent and tryna' get the rent paid
Daddy left when the baby came (damn), left mommy all alone to struggle
My credit good and I’m throwing money in the club, I ain’t knockin’ bitches hustle
On the low, that’s what Jay did, well that ain’t even on the low
Probably ain’t even know he did that, now he did if he ain’t know
Tell him [?] to my crime partner that’s what Jay shouted out (whoa)
Even Rolling Stone wrote an article, say that’s what he was talkin’ ‘bout
Little niggas ain’t bumbin’ Jay, 4:44 went over they head
Niggas rather Lil’ Uzi, push me to the edge all my friends are dead instead (serious?!)
They don't know what real rap ‘bout, I’m off this, Power back out
Jamie St. Patrick was locked up, beat the case, now he back out (he ain't rat)
Watchin' it with my lady, maybe it’s cuz I ain’t smoke yet
Call 50 like, “Yo, why you ain’t let Kanan kill Ghost yet?” (yo, Fif)
Niggas don't want no beef with us, they freeze up when the squeeze at us
Niggas shooting in the air, you tryin’ to hit me, or you tryin’ to shoot Jesus up (hallelujah)
Real niggas out here stravin’, while the weirdos gettin’ fat (ooouuu)
Got to question a niggas character when you see him hangin’ ‘round a rat (ooouuu)
Niggas be like I know who did it, that’s how the police know who did it (ooouuu)
If everybody keep they mouth shut, watch how fast the case get acquitted

[Outro]
What’s understood, we don't talk about it (ooouuu)
Catch a body, we don't talk about it (ooouuu)
Fuck shawty, we don't talk about it (ooouuu)
Gettin’ money, we don't talk about it (ooouuu)
What’s understood, we don't talk about it (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
What’s understood, we don't talk about it (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
What’s understood, we don't talk about it (whoa)
Catch a body, we don't talk about it (ooouuu)
Fuck shawty, we don't talk about it (ooouuu)
Gettin’ money, we don't talk about it (ooouuu)
What’s understood, we don't talk about it (whoa)
What’s understood, we don't talk about it (whoa)
