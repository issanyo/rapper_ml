[Intro]
GMG
Green Lantern on the beat
Uncle Murda, oh

[Hook]
Anybody can get it
And I ain't got a problem taking care of the witness
Money, power, respect
For that money, I'll pop whoever in the neck

[Verse]
I bust guns and them drugs I move it
Police know what I do, but they can't prove it
I'll take your car, music bumpin' like "What?"
I don't know how to drive, I'ma crash your whip up
Then jump out the car, look, police on my ass
I smoke too much, I can't run that fast
Then I turn around and start squeezing at the coppers
They all fall back when I pull out that big chopper
Lil homie, go ask your big brother
He'll tell you I'm the truth, that's word to your mother
I hate the cops and I know they hate me
I gotta smoke haze so I don't shoot at police
GMG for life, my killas is with me
It ain't hard to tell, I run Liberty City
Every project and South block in the city
They'll tell you listen to Murda, that boy get busy
From Broker to Dukes, Bohan to Schottler
I got niggas saying, "I heard Murda shot ya"
Yeah, I got my four fifth, yeah, I got a full clip
Yeah, GMG backing up on my bullshit
I ain't gon' shoot your leg or shoot you in the arm
I might shoot you in the head or shoot your baby moms
I put that work in, but I ain't going to prison
I don't care 'bout that broad, anybody can get it

[Hook]
Anybody can get it
And I ain't got a problem taking care of the witness
Money, power, respect
For that money, I'll pop whoever in the neck
