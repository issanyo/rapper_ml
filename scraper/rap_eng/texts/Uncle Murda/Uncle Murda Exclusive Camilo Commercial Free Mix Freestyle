(Woo! new dub city! Hot 97 ya heard? DJ Camilo ya heard? Nessa Nessa ya heard? Woo Woo Woo Woo Woo)

If you ain't tuned into Camilo you a dub
We in traffic feeling like we in the club (turn up!)
Feel like i'm in aces or sugar daddys
Throwin' money at cars beepin' they horns at me
This that Camilo commercial free mix
Tune in call up might win some free s***
Might get to talk to that pretty girl Nessa
She mmm mmm mmm woo God done blessed her
Turn the music up so I don't catch road rage
Not today not gon be sittin' in no cage
We ain't gettin' home in like 6 in the mornin
We was in the club mad EFFEN Vodka was pourin' (50 what up!)
DJ Camilo was DJing some chick talkin' to me I don't know what she sayin' (the music too loud)
I don't hear her but I wanna be heard
On your Hot 9-7 everyday, that's my word

(Hot 97 ya heard? DJ Camilo ya heard? Nessa Nessa ya heard? Woo woo woo woo woo)
