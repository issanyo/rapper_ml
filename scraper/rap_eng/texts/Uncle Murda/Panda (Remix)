[Uncle Murda Verse]
I got shooters out in Brooklyn
I liked his chain so I took it
Got cocaine, 'bout to cook it
All the police crooked
Got pieces on me that's in
Got money, ain't gotta spend it
This beat 'bout to get murdered
I thought this was Future when I heard it
Got thots all in the trap
I can turn coke into crack
This dope just caught a body
Custy O-D-ed in the lobby
These Maison Margiela's, Better stop wearing Gucci
Goddamn Amber Rose, had her fingers all in Ye booty
Pull up, jump out the Beamer
I'm in the club with a Nina
Chick with me named Trina
Got a friend with her named Tina
'Bout to have that ménage
Chicks look like Beyonce
Smoking loud like Ri-Ri
Been drinking gotta go pee-pee


[Hook- Desiigner]
I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards and the scammers
Hitting off licks in the bando
Black X6, Phantom
White X6 looks like a panda
Going out like I’m Montana
Hundred killers, hundred hammers
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, panda
Pockets swole, Danny
Selling bar, candy
Man I'm the macho like Randy
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
Bitch nigga pull up ya panty
Hope you killas understand me

[Bridge]
Hey

Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda

I got broads in Atlanta twisting dope, lean, and shit sipping Fanta
Credit cards and the scammers
Wake up Versace shit, life Desiigner
Whole buncha lot of shit
They be asking round town who be clappin shit
I pullin up stuff in the Phantom ship
I got plenty of stuff of Bugatti whip look how I try this shit
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, killing on camera
Pop a Perc, I can't stand up
Gorilla, they come and kill you with bananas
Four fillas, they finna pull up in the Phantom

Big Rollie, it dancing bigger than a Pandie
Go Oscar for Grammy, bitch pull up your panty
Fill up I'ma flip it, I got bitches pull up and they get it
I got niggas that's counting for digits
Say you make you a lot of new money
Know some niggas pull off and they in the Rafe

Call up Phillip-Phillip, gone fill the bank, niggas up in the bank
We gone drill the bank, fuck we gone kill the bank, get it

Did it all for a ticket
Now flex drop bombs when he spin it
And Bobby gone trend it

Counting to the chicken
And all of my niggas gone split it
