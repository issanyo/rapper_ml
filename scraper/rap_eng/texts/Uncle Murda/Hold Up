[Intro: Uncle Murda]
Hold up (hold up, hold up)
Hold up, hold up
Woooo

[Chorus: Uncle Murda]
Hold up, hold up
What's good, what's your name, nigga?
You affiliated with who? And you reppin' what gang, nigga?
Hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up
Who 'dere? Who 'dere? Can't just let anybody roll up
Hold up, hold up
We takin' you 'cause we supposed to
What you said your name was again? Naw, my niggas don't know you
Hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up
Who 'dere? Who 'dere? Can't just let anybody roll up

[Verse 1: Uncle Murda]
I don't care if you with a nigga that's with me, what that mean?
You his man, you ain't my man, you ain't gang gang, you ain't with the team
Trust issues, I got 'em
I'm not your brother, don't call me bro
I told my man come get your man, I don't like your man, your man gotta go
I know nigga don't like me, from the projects, yeah, I'm grimey
If I was blood, everyday I probably pull a almighty ten-ninety
Set trippin' in the parkin' lot soon as niggas walk out the spot
It was all good a week ago, that Henny got a nigga lookin’ like the opp
Fire here in that glass jar, kitchen smellin' like Mexico
If a nigga rob me, he might as well shoot himself like Plaxico
We send shots, not messages
We don’t leave no witnesses
We don’t do it for the 'Gram, we don’t want the internet to get a wind of this
Where the money? What the business is?
Who you? Where the plug at?
Why talk to a nigga if it ain't 'bout the money, who does that?
Why talk to a nigga that I don’t know, he might be the po-po
Or he might be down with the opp tryna line me up on the low-low

[Chorus: Uncle Murda]
What's good, what's your name, nigga?
You affiliated with who? And you reppin' what gang, nigga?
Hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up
Who 'dere? Who 'dere? Can't just let anybody roll up
Hold up, hold up
We takin' you 'cause we supposed to
What you said your name was again? Naw, my niggas don't know you
Hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up
Who 'dere? Who 'dere? Can't just let anybody roll up

[Verse 2: Dave East]
You a opp or a fan, nigga?
I know you watchin' on the 'Gram, nigga
Don’t lose your life for a band, nigga
Got the Desert on me, I’m a sand nigga
Caught him lackin' on the East, man got clipped
He was up in [?] with 'em
Amiri got me rockin' tan denim (eleven hunnid, [?])
Hold up, gotta roll up
Got some Cali' we can smoke up
The homies proud to see the loc up
Deadass, my paper don’t joke much (deadass)
Them niggas roll up and you choked up
They ask me about, don’t know much
Jealous, I see your shit slowed up
Gold medals, they need to reward us
I had start with a quarter
I had to trap for a lawyer
You’ll get clapped in the mornin'
This track is a actual warnin'
[?] actually performin'
Thirty K if you wanna perform this
Fifteen just to see my face
Clear them niggas out, I can see my way
Snoop told me I'm the hardest young nigga out
Honestly, I needed Dre
Gotta bring it wit' us when we leave the Bay
Don’t give a fuck what the people say
Know we showin' up them people play
Numbers runnin' up, I just be in Chase
I told you we be in touch
Slowed up, I seen his face

[Chorus: Uncle Murda]
Hol' up, hol' up
What's good, what's your name, nigga?
You affiliated with who? And you reppin' what gang, nigga?
Hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up
Who 'dere? Who 'dere? Can't just let anybody roll up
Hold up, hold up
We takin' you 'cause we supposed to
What you said your name was again? Naw, my niggas don't know you
Hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up
Who 'dere? Who 'dere? Can't just let anybody roll up
