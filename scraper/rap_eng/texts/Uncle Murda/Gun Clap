[Hook x2: Chief Keef]
Fuck nigga wanna try me but it's not that
You gon' catch some holes in your Sox cap
We don't gum clap, we let guns clap
Bitch we don't gum clap, we let guns clap

[Verse 1: Bo Deal]
I don't gum clap, nigga I let guns clap
Open wide, I'mma put the barrel where your gums at
Niggas better fall back, my niggas wearing all black
Run up, a motherfucker lucky if they crawl back
Hop out a four door, strapped up with a four-four
Bet them hollows knock him out his frame like a photo, yeah
I'm on Squad shit, killa' klan, the mob shit
Thirty pop off my hip if niggas wanna start shit
You niggas rapping, we live the shit that we rap about
Fuck talking, if it's a problem ho we can clap it out
Flood a nigga quick, leave his ass sea sick
High slugs will bang bang him on that Chief Keef shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Fuck nigga wanna try me but it's not that
I'm Chief Sosa, all you imitators stop that
Niggas slow as fuck, they don't know we 'bout that
You don't know us fuck boy, we shoot snap backs
Bullets beat his life like a southside
This ain't no Southside, this Lex Luger track
Where Lex Luger at? Smoke a forty pack
I'm in the club flexing, my whole crew be strapped
With a lot of weapons, niggas moving back
Got bitches staring, they like who is that?
Bitch it's GBE, we a scene to see
We make shit very scary for our enemies

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Uncle Murda]
I'mma hit him in his head, where my hammer at?
Let the forty put a hole in his Yankee hat
If his crew wanna ride, they can get it too
We know where them niggas be, we will kill 'em too
Crip, Blood, I don't care what set you rep
If you kill a snitch nigga, you'll get my respect
Hit the club thirty bottles, make a movie yo
Oh I treat a boosy broad like she a stupid ho
When they start talking tell 'em shut the fuck up
I don't wanna get to know you, I just wanna fuck
I don't even know her name, she let me hit nigga
Then I sent her back home to her bitch nigga

[Hook]
