(Hook: Que Banz)
I can't trust these n****'s they be switchin' sides
Trappin' in the bando with yo b**** inside
Money new hunnid's blue I just spent a dime
Me and you are not the same we on a different time x3
Try and 9 me when you find me better grip yo 9
Patek Philippe Avianne we on a different time

(Verse 1: Uncle Murda)
Had to hustle and rob they ain't leave me a choice
This can't be life Jay-Z and Bean's voice
Never had a 9 to 5 I ain't believe in that
So the block is where I decided i'm eatin' at
The staircase is where the fiends used to meet me at
Police searchin' me lookin' for work but I was cheekin' that
Was on that block every night gettin' to that bag
Wanted that Gucci and Versace s*** Biggie had
Cookin' that cocaine til it turned hard
I'm livin' in hell still believing in God
I got faith like i'm Frank White
Fiends don't want that work if it ain't right
N****'s don't want you comin' up if they ain't eatin'
The block jumpin' i'm out here I ain't leavin'
I'm poppin' I ain't one of these lame n****'s
Me and Carmelo Anthony f***ing the same strippers
Going hand to hand is what made me a boss
I know how to bounce back after takin' a loss
See Trump got his trial and the b****'s in court
Judge made them realize they ain't as tough as they thought
Bodies done drop for this money I got
I earned these diamonds that I got on my watch
I earned these diamonds that I got on my chain
I treated myself for puttin' in all of that pain

(Hook: Que Banz)
I can't trust these n****'s they be switchin' sides
Trappin' in the bando with yo b**** inside
Money new hunnid's blue I just spent a dime
Me and you are not the same we on a different time x3
Try and 9 me when you find me better grip yo 9
Patek Philippe Avianne we on a different time

(Verse 2: Don Q)
I just wanna open this up tellin' y'all i'm opening up
I wanna be able to smell it before I open it up
That s*** ain't pourin' enough I be plottin' low in the cut
Lookin' at the TV like that's supposed to be us
But who am I to blame i'm still a student of the game
I maneuver out the ring and bring my shooters when I came
I need a b**** that's a down one when them pounds come
Make this outta town one don't leave til your rounds done
Time to time I still chop it up with the old heads
They told me how most n****'s snitch when you go fed
Told me to switch the hustle the flow dead
My brother pop died in Flodeg you ain't quote dead
Times I still wish I had a brick for the coke heads
Pull up with a mountain of snow and tell'em go sled
Remember Halloween's back when we used to throw eggs
Still in Moped's gave a f*** what the pope said
N**** which one you happen to pick
Judge by 12 or carry by 6
Grandad said "be careful with the drugs don't let'em defeat you"
I said "I don't do the drugs I just sell them to people"
He told me "it's cold up when you going up"
Couple n****'s come through and see how you holdin' up
B****'s on your cell war that you was holdin' up
Give us some time them packages and them b****'s start slowin' up

(Hook: Que Banz)
I can't trust these n****'s they be switchin' sides
Trappin' in the bando with yo b**** inside
Money new hunnid's blue I just spent a dime
Me and you are not the same we on a different time x3
