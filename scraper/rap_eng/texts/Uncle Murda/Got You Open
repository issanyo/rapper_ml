Hov and Drake beefin, Ohh I love it
You know controversy excites the public
You nobody till you get shot and die
What if Puff was dead and BIG was alive?
I'd be with BIG in LA in an armour truck
Without Puff Ciroc would've went bankrupt
The new generation, still got a lot to learn
Y'all gotta take a back seat
I still ain't get my turn
Got a pretty Puerto Rican on her knees
I'm wrapping the shit out of her hair
She ain't got no weave
She said she got a man
I ain't convince her to do it
She don’t mind cheating on him for me
He a fan of my music

She say he bump my shit all day everyday
Like Murda supposed to be that nigga
Man I'm so mad at Jay
I thought it was on when he signed son
Murda like a skinny Biggie Smalls when he rhymes son
But back to them hammers em young'ns are squeezing
Police'll shoot you if they think you think about reaching
And thats the kinda cops I grew up round
I got locked up and forth for tryna shoot them down
I'm bagging up a brick, feeling like I hit the Lotto
[?] white bitches like to swallow people
I dont serve to my own kind, I serve white people
For all em years of slavery, Dont tell me I'm evil

Dont front, you know I got you open
When I wrote this, OG kush is what I was smokin
New York vs. New York, we always competing
Even the radio stations and DJs beefin
You gave your record to who first, You stupid dawg
Don’t be mad when certain DJs dont make a movie dawg
Dont front, you know I got you open
When I wrote this, OG kush is what I was smokin
Get my work from LA
And I know how to send it back
Mexicans out there showed me where they killed Biggie at
Yea ate a sample
Yea I know it got you open
When I wrote this, OG kush is what I was smokin

You nah mean
A lil something like
Rest in peace to the wannabe me, BIG, Jay-Z rappers
GMG, Brooklyn, New York city
I talk that talk and I walk that walk wit it
Salute the real
