:[VERSE 1: ZHA_LOVEE]

SAY MY NAME BUT ABUSE IT,
THEY CALL ME ZHA_LOVEE
THATS JUST HOW WE DO IT
LOVE HIP-HOP MAKE IT DROP LIKE FLUID
MAKE IT SMART LIKE STUPID
DID I LEAVE YOU CLUELESS,(NALL YOU JUST STUPID)
IM THAT KINDA CHICK WHO HANG OUT ON THE SIDE LINES
WHY THESE BOYS SEE ME AS A DOLLAR SIGN
ARE YOU COLOR BLIND
OR ARE YOU OUT CHA' MIND
YOU IN THE FRONT, PUSH YOU BACK IN TIME
YOU AINT WORTH A PEICE OF CANDY
AINT EVEN SWEET
DROP YOU ON THE FLOOR MESS AROUND AND GET SWEEPED
I COULD REALLY CARE LESS, IF YOU THINK YOUR THE BEST
I AM RAISED IN THE WEST
