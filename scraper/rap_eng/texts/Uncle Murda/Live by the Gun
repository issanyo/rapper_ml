[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Lex, Lex, Lex, Lex, Lex on the track, bow!
We the murder team, we the murder team
Infamous murder, man

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
A nigga shoot at me, so you know I'm shooting back
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
A nigga shoot at me, so you know I'm shooting back

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Just handguns, all white Air Ones
Niggas talking one-on-one's, ain't no fair ones
You feel me, son? (I do, my dog)
So TTG, let's go to war
Number one video, BET
MTV, so sucker free
You live your life through these movies, you a TV
A nigga fuck with me, squiggly lines and IV's
Uncle said, "Flocka, murder this motherfucker"
Yo, Ra, dig a hole for these motherfuckers
Let me brush my shoulders off
Jay-Z, R.I.P to Pimp C

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
A nigga shoot at me, so you know I'm shooting back
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
A nigga shoot at me, so you know I'm shooting back

[Verse 2: Ra Diggs]
When a nigga see me, you know that I got it on me
Either the Desert Eagle, that 5th or that 40
I'm strapped up, shawty, ask my nigga Waka
Ask my nigga Uncle when I murder with the chopper
Nigga shot me five times, two days later, the nigga died
Niggas shooting at the five is committing a suicide
I'm a Murderous Mad Dawg, that's the acronym
MMD, you front on me, a nigga clapping them
I'm the big homie, act like you don't know me
Put in my own work, but niggas'll kill for me
I'm Dudus in Jamaica, front on me, then I make them
Whole country shot 'cause I'm a real Don Dada
Blocka

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
A nigga shoot at me, so you know I'm shooting back
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
A nigga shoot at me, so you know I'm shooting back

[Verse 3: Uncle Murda]
I'm Uncle Murda, I caught hella bodies
GMG like the Shower Posse
Niggas I got beef with, they don't ever ball
They never seen a brick, they hustling 8-balls
Hollow tips when I hit my enemies up
I feel like Bishop when he hit Raheem up
I got the juice, that Grey Goose
Got these groupies giving me head on the project roof
40 Cals, AK's
When it's beef, when we creep, those the guns we spray
I'm a rider, these niggas deserve to die
Like Omar's gay ass from The Wire

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
A nigga shoot at me, so you know I'm shooting back
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
Live by the gun, I'ma die by the gun
A nigga shoot at me, so you know I'm shooting back
