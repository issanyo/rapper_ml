She told me he in love he be lovin her
Once I heard that out of spite I start crushin her
Brown hair homey handcuffin her
You know me one night with the chick then I'm dumpin her
I was gettin gettin gettin some head
Then I'm back on the block gettin gettin that bread
My fo' fifth fully loaded loaded
