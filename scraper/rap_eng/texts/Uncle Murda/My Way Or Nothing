[Intro: Lloyd Banks & DJ Whoo Kid]
All by myself I riii-iii-iiide
Bring it back
All by myself I riii-iii-iiide
Let's go


[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
I don't need nobody by my siii-iii-iiide
Surviving on my liii-iii-iiie...
Now I gotta make it riii-iii-iiight


[Verse 1  - Lloyd Banks]
Bad luck and a gift where I'm a go with this ?
To the top I ain't dying another no one miss
So I'm putting in time over shift
Got too many problems for the sober shit
We all getting older quick
You roll with me you hold a clip
Keep your moving militant you won't get hit
Victim to a open strip
Love the purp need a open trip
G-5 laying to a smoking whip
Chain like the old Slick Rick
New label movie making and I'm usually able
Give you the G to make a dime acting bougie pay you
I had a shine since a moving cradle
I'm glowing! The rap owens and I'm going
Where they bill throwing
I dust 'em! - Nothing but heels showing. - I'm outy!
A trail of smoke behind me bet it make 'em talk about me
Fuck a percentage give me mine up front
I kill the pain with the liquor!
Clear my mind with the blunt.. What up!


[Hook]
These niggas bluffing! - Spine made of stuffing
We don't follow order well round here - my way or nothing
Not here to just be but gunning for something
Let my clock stop
Before the time you niggas coming!


[Bridge]
I'm not what you used to! - I'm unusual
That alone will make you mad what the jewels do
Who confused you ?
Don't make us move you
Don't play around with my crew is the new rule!


[Verse 2 - Uncle Murda]
That's word to that brick in my crib - if it's beef
I catch you slipping you're dead
I don't care if you with your kid
If you ain't got no beef, go start some
Beef let you know who in your crew got heart son
In my hood niggas baby momma's be vexed
When they hear their man be beefing with
Me what you expect
Them chicks know I'm way more harder!
And now the kids is growing up without their father
The Boogie Man tell ya!
Murda a monster!
I've been bussing my gun since niggas was playing Contra
And I was just a lil' little boy
When my momma died
I been thinking about the good ol' days
When I'm getting high
I'm the black George Bush of this war shit
He beefing for more oil I'm beefing for more bricks!
You better hope you get a chance to bang, yo!
I'm a shoot you in your face!
Till I run outta ammo!


[Hook]
These niggas bluffing! - Spine made of stuffing
We don't follow order well round here - my way or nothing
Not here to just be but gunning for something
Let my clock stop
Before the time you niggas coming!


[Bridge]
I'm not what you used to! - I'm unusual
That alone will make you mad what the jewels do
Who confused you ?
Don't make us move you
Don't play around with my crew is the new rule!

[Verse 3 -  Lloyd Banks]
Uh!
Southside to the soul, I eat sleep that
Never really left so I ain't gotta bring the heat back
Swammie On Deck-o
Put the pedal on the petrol
And the pieces all plastic
Heavy metal on my neck though
Little shit comes just hanging' I had to let go
Gotta make my future look bright, view in Baguette flow!
And your a step slow, don't make me step on ya
10 prints consecutive push out the last breath in ya
New Porsche leffin' ya I'm living to the max
Live my life tryin' to get here. - Damn, if I'm going back..
In the day never thought I'd get away
Bodies drop, y'all pray don't know another way. - Hey!
Coppers got us on display
Probably do anything' for dollars and some yay -
From farmers to the bay
A part of my pajamas is the trey
Trust me! - I put that on my momma I don't play


[Hook]
These niggas bluffing! - Spine made of stuffing
We don't follow order well round here - my way or nothing
Not here to just be but gunning for something
Let my clock stop
Before the time you niggas coming!


[Bridge]
I'm not what you used to! - I'm unusual
That alone will make you mad what the jewels do
Who confused you ?
Don't make us move you
Don't play around with my crew is the new rule!
