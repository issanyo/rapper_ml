[Intro: Future]
Niggas in the club right now
Blowin' on kush, gettin' money right now
Niggas wanna play right now
Got jewels, got cars, got shooters right now
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

[Chorus: Future]
100 shooters in the club, 100 bottles
100 shooters in the club, 100 bottles
Coppin' the whips on these niggas
Don't fuck, don't fuck, don't fuck with these niggas
Ain't got no love for these niggas
No love, no love, no love for these niggas
I just blow the cash on my young ho
I just blow some cash on my young ho
Fuckin' up this cash with my young niggas
Fuckin' up a bag with my young niggas

[Verse 1: Uncle Murda]
Niggas in the club right now
Bitches gettin' high on drugs right now
Got shooters on deck, I call Crips, call Bloods right now
Real niggas back, I'm puttin' on for my hittas
We blowin' money, we throwin' money at strippers
Niggas in the trap right now
Whippin' it 'til it come back right now
I'm strapped right now
Even police get clapped right now
Break a whole brick down
Look at all of these baggies
I got your bitch on 5th ave, I'm Daddy

[Chorus: Future]
100 shooters in the club, 100 bottles
100 shooters in the club, 100 bottles
Coppin' the whips on these niggas
Don't fuck, don't fuck, don't fuck with these niggas
Ain't got no love for these niggas
No love, no love, no love for these niggas
I just blow the cash on my young ho
I just blow some cash on my young ho
Fuckin' up this cash with my young niggas
Fuckin' up a bag with my young niggas

[Verse 2: Uncle Murda]
Oh, I just got some pounds from the plug
If you ain't gettin' money, you a dub
I'm lit right now
Bitch, recognize who you with right now
I'm the shit right
Look at the flick of the wrist right now
This audemar cost the price of a New York brick right now
Scheme on it, I drop a bag and get you hit right now
My bread right now
Can't tell me I can't beat the Feds right now
If Future don't trust ya
Bang bang, hit you in the head right now

[Bridge: Future & Uncle Murda]
If Murda don't trust you, he gon' shoot you
Lil' Mexico don't trust you, we gon shoot you
Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon shoot you
If Brooklyn don't trust you, they gon shoot you
Brat, brat, brat, brat, Free Rowdy, bitch!
Brat, brat, brat, brat, Free Bobby, bitch!
Run up on a nigga like bang bang
Get you popped right now
Make a nigga go meet 'Pac right now

[Chorus: Future]
100 shooters in the club, 100 bottles
100 shooters in the club, 100 bottles
Coppin' the roof off these niggas
Dont fuck, dont fuck, dont fuck with these niggas
Ain't got no love for these niggas
No love, no love, no love for these niggas
I just blow the cash on my young ho
I just blow some cash on my young ho
Fuckin' up this cash with my young niggas
Fuckin' up some bands with my young niggas

[Bridge: Future]
If Murda don't trust you, we gon' shoot you
Lil' Mexico don't trust you, we gon shoot you
Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon shoot you
If Brooklyn don't trust you, they gon shoot you
Headshots, trap money
The streets watchin', but they ain't trippin'
If money come this fast, I swear to God I never spend it

[Outro]
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga
