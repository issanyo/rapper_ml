[Intro: Que Bandz & Uncle Murda]
Woo, whoa
You know what the fuck it is nigga
I got the bank now, whoa

[Chorus: Que Banz & Uncle Murda]
It's feelin' like I got the bank now
Trip' six CeeLo is all I'm shootin'
Grippin' that thing now
Stickin' shit up if I start losin'
I got the juice now
Bitch I'm Makaveli and 2Pac, I be too proud
They like who shot ya? I hit 'em up with a few rounds
'Bet whatever my nigga, I got the bank now
I used to side bet nigga, I got the bank now
Your money good my nigga, I got the bank now
Money on the world my nigga, I got the bank now

[Verse 1: Que Banz]
I remember posted up by the train at the junction
Now I'm with the swipers with the pieces tryna punch in
Y'all still tryna guess what I got, makin' assumptions
Money ain't the topic my nigga, change the discussion
This that mental rap, packs the rental rap, glizzy strapped
Crash the whip, real trip, we send that rental back
Niggas scheme watch, beam with the grip, you get slingshot
If 12 come I'm peelin' off in a creme drop
Struggles I been through nigga, I got a lot to say
I done seen a nigga catch a case off a pot of yay
Drop the bread, I feed him lead, boy he gon' die today
Got a dopehead for three bundles, gon' supply the cake
Smoke switch, then codeswitch, either the clear goose
Mood switch, got two grips, I keep a pair to shoot
Try and run, we end dude
Send them shots, we clearin' you
Drag him to the top of the roof and make him parachute
Two chains, my mood swing, you loose change
Black coupe, that Mulsanne, I'm Bruce Wayne
Niggas mad but they know, got the bag for the low
Put a price on his head and now his tag got a toe, whoa

[Chorus: Que Banz & Uncle Murda]
It's feelin' like I got the bank now
Trip' six CeeLo is all I'm shootin'
Grippin' that thing now
Stickin' shit up if I start losin'
I got the juice now
Bitch I'm Makaveli and 2Pac, I be too proud
They like who shot ya? I hit 'em up with a few rounds
'Bet whatever my nigga, I got the bank now
I used to side bet nigga, I got the bank now
Your money good my nigga, I got the bank now
Money on the world my nigga, I got the bank now

[Verse 2: Uncle Murda]
Caught a body, ain't tell nobody, like what's the point?
Niggas' niggas be the reason that niggas be in the joint
Black hoodie, my mask on with them black gloves
'Cause that white jury and white judge don't like us
Smoke exotic, them narcotics is what we distribute
My shooters out your shooter, your shooter ain't even get to shoot
Fendi, Givenchy, and Valentino
We play blackjack or shoot craps at the casino
With the Mexicans, got it for sale again, talkin' kilos
Play Gee Money, I'm my brother's keeper like Nino
A side deal will get your head tapped where I come from
These bullets and the feds is two things you can't run from
Seven MAC-11's, eight thirty-eights
If he an Alpo, let the forty cal blow at his face
Made crack sales and dope sales in front of minors
Put hard dick and quarter of bricks in bitches' vaginas
Caught a robbery, nigga almost bodied me, I ain't pat him down
Let him go, then he took a shot at me
I'm that kid that wanted to play Monopoly
Invested in real estate, now a hood nigga got property

[Chorus: Que Bandz & Uncle Murda]
It's feelin' like I got the bank now
Trip' six CeeLo is all I'm shootin'
Grippin' that thing now
Stickin' shit up if I start losin'
I got the juice now
Bitch I'm Makaveli and 2Pac, I be too proud
They like who shot ya? I hit 'em up with a few rounds
'Bet whatever my nigga, I got the bank now
I used to side bet nigga, I got the bank now
Your money good my nigga, I got the bank now
Money on the world my nigga, I got the bank now
