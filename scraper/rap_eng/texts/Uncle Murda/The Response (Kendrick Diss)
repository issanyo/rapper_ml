[Verse 1 Uncle Murda]
Everybody like you heard what that nigga said?
Niggas getting offended
Everybody running to the studio
Trying to make a diss record about Kendrick (one, two, one, two)
Tell Kendrick I ain't mad at him, (I ain't mad at you)
This is exactly what the game needed
Everybody want to be homeboys, rappers competition, start competing
For calling niggas names out, Kendrick I thank you
But for saying you the king, niggas want me to spank you
I am like yeah I heard what Kendrick said
But lil homie ain't a threat (he not)
Maybe if Game or Snoop said it
Then I would be more upset (word)
Jay not dead, Nas alive
You the king? Kendrick, come on how do that sound?
Okay say if they don't count no more
Then it's me and Fab fighting for the crown
A$AP Rocky hotter than both of y'all
Years niggas like that fucking up yo culture y'all
This what niggas get for not checking Snoop
When he kicked down the building, that's why Kendrick getting cute
How you gon' claim something that you not
Oh I get it this nigga wanna be 2Pac
And I am a west coast crip on the blood block
Kicking it with bloods, talking about all the bloods I shot
King of Oakland, why you ain't say that?
Cause them niggas that robbed 2 Chainz don't play that
Damn Murda I know you ain't gonna say that
First 50, now Drake trying to bring Mase back
But P Diddy wanna get paid
He ain't letting niggas eat off of niggas he made
And son I can't front I respect that
Puff like y'all know what I want where the check that
I don't hold mine gun sideways I shoot straight
Remember when Dr. Dre used to dress like a fruitcake
Let them out of town niggas know shit done change
Niggas can't party out here if they don't get a pass from me and Maino
Motherfucka we brooklyn
And that crown I said me and Fab was fighting for? I just took it!
