I'mma say what's on my mind
Y'all can say whatever
I'm rooting for Trump
He bringing back the Reagan era
Can't trust Hillary
Hillary can't suck dick
That's why Bill cheated with the Monica Lewinsky bitch
Homies getting shot up in front of they kids
You think we give a fuck who the president is
I know the kid they shot but I'm cooler with the shooter
After he shot him, he robbed him, went to the jeweler
Huh, got niggas tucking their chain in
Crime pays when you putting that pain in
Her man got shot, look at her ungrateful ass
She ain't at the hospital, she in the club shaking her ass

Oh we in the hood we all strapped like
Niggas like, "You heard about that kid they killed last night?"
Huh, I'm like, "Nope. I don't wanna hear about it
Wasn't none of my niggas, homie, so I don't want to care about it."
He like, "His cousin was in the fifth grade with you."
I'm like, "Homie, I don't care who he related to"
I ain't losing no sleep over that dead nigga
I don't care if his mother heard what I said, nigga
Damn, Murda, you cold
I was fucking with Rico
Damn, nigga, you told
Iâ€™m paid in full with a full clip
I'm shooting niggas that's cool with niggas I'm beefing with
