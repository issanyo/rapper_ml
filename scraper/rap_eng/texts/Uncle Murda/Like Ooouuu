[Chorus: Aviator Keyz]
Girl, I'ma have that pussy like oouuu
Girl, I'ma have that pussy like oouuu

Girl, I'ma have that pussy like oouuu, ooouu, oouuu, yeah
Girl, you colder than a light flu
Won't you spin it round my way like typhoon?
I'm just tryna slide up in it like vroom
Girl, I'ma have that pussy like oouuu

[Verse 1: Uncle Murda]
Got the pussy like oouuu, Young M.A voice
Oouuu, that was Young M.A voice
Got a kingsize bed, be a freak on it
I don't pillow talk, never speak on it
Turn around, wanna see your ass when you sittin' on it
Like when you give me top and you be spittin' on it
I just wanna beat it up like it stole somethin'
Never tell you no, with your ex, he let you hold somethin'
See I used to have the juice, now I have the sauce
I'ma eat it but you ain't gettin' your salad tossed
Uh, Jhene Aiko was outta line," Eat it like groceries"
That was bitches' favorite line
No telly, I'ma take it to the trap house
Feel safe, got my shooters in the trap house
Beat the pussy up, she about to pass out
Lookin' like a UFC fighter tryna tap out

[Chorus: Aviator Keyz]
Girl, I'ma have that pussy like oouuu
Girl, I'ma have that pussy like oouuu
Girl, I'ma have that pussy like oouuu, ooouu, oouuu, yeah
Girl, I'ma have that pussy like oouuu
Girl, I'ma have that pussy like oouuu
Girl, I'ma have that pussy like oouuu, ooouu, oouuu, yeah
Girl, you colder than a light flu
Won't you spin it round my way like typhoon?
I'm just tryna slide up in it like vroom
Girl, I'ma have that pussy like oouuu
Girl, I'ma have that pussy like oouuu
Girl, I'ma have that pussy like oouuu
Girl, I'ma have that pussy like oouuu, ooouu, oouuu, yeah

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
I'ma have the pussy on oouuu shit
Uh, cock got the pussy on Cool Whip
Uh, I'ma have the pussy on dumb, da-da-da-dumb, dumb
I'ma have the pussy on stupid
Straight through, got the pussy on Cupid
So clean, gotta eat it with a toothpick
So bad, gotta beat it with the Mike Jack
Uh, woonwalk it, trill nigga on the smooth shit
Uh, you know I beat the pussy like oouuu
Nobody make you feel like I do
Uh, I pull up on you, slide through
Give me good brain like you got good IQ
I would like to but I can't leave it
Got money up late and I can't sleep in
Got bitches in the bed and they pants leakin'
Shit crazy, you know how I am, yeah

[Chorus: Aviator Keyz]
Girl, I'ma have that pussy like oouuu

[Verse 3: Uncle Murda]
Girl, I'ma have that pussy like whoa
When you about to come, I want you to lemme know (lemme know)
Call me daddy, I wanna hear you say that
Your rent due, I got you, I'ma pay that (you good)
Don't be scratchin' on my back, I don't play that (nope)
Got in trouble for some shit like that way back (I did)
I been drinkin' all bad, nigga smacked
I gotta eat somethin' and you lookin' like a snack (grrr)
She a lil freak, lemme tell you somethin' 'bout her (what?)
She don't like it when I fuck a bitch without her (haha)
She like, "How many times a bitch gotta remind you?"
I think this bitch like bitches more than I do (word)
I'm in the studio, rappin' 'bout the pussy
Like Michael Blackson and Erica Badu
Got her on FaceTime, I'm in the Chanel store
Like which one of these bags you want me to buy you? (which one?)

[Outro: Aviator Keyz]
Girl, I'ma have that pussy like oouuu
