[Intro: Fetty Wap]
I’m the man
I’m the man
I’m the man
I’m the man

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
I’m the man with the bands, maybe you heard of me
Princess cut diamonds, need surgery
Pull up to the front like [?]
I’m the man of the year, maybe you heard of me
I’m the man with the bands, maybe you heard of me
Princess cut diamonds, need surgery
Pull up to the front like [?]
I’m the man of the year, maybe you heard of me

[Verse 1: Uncle Murda]
I just got some bands from the bando
Riding with the strap, I got extra ammo
Niggas heard of me, ain’t no place I can’t go
I’m on the west, the Mexican Fernando
I’m the man, I’m the man, I’m the man
I could get you some loud, I could get you some grams
I could get you some molly, Percocet or some Xans
I could get you some pieces if you ready to scale
I could get you a hammer if you ready to blam
I could get you some pussy but shawty gon’ cost a band
Let’s go on vacation boo, forget about your man
Want a chocolate complexion, [?] her a Xan
Back [?] fuck her, it ain’t even cost him a band
You like girls, talk to the beach, I could get you some sand
Want some molly in your drink? she was like yeah baby
I’m like good ‘cause I came prepared baby

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
I’m the man with the bands, maybe you heard of me
Princess cut diamonds, need surgery
Pull up to the front like [?]
I’m the man of the year, maybe you heard of me
I’m the man with the bands, maybe you heard of me
Princess cut diamonds, need surgery
Pull up to the front like [?] clergery
I’m the man of the year, maybe you heard of me

[Verse 2: Uncle Murda]
Just pulled up in the black Caddy
Ten different chicks start calling me daddy
They was with some dudes, them dudes was aggy
Fronting up they face like they was gon’ clap me
See them niggas that I’m with is loco
You don’t want a problem with them, oh no
And they sippin’ on that Henny, oh no, oh no, oh no
I’m the man, I’m the man, I’m the man
Two sticks on me in case one of them jam
Boop, they both tucked under the Louis
See the sixth chick’s face as she looked at my jewelry
I wasn’t impressed with her coochie
Instead of a Birkin bag, gave her money for Gucci
Don’t do dates, no dinner, no movie
Just bust the pussy down like it was a loosey

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
I’m the man with the bands, maybe you heard of me
Princess cut diamonds, need surgery
Pull up to the front like [?]

I’m the man with the bands, maybe you heard of me
Princess cut diamonds, need surgery
Pull up to the front like [?]

[Bridge: Fetty Wap]

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
I’m the man with the bands, maybe you heard of me
Princess cut diamonds, need surgery
Pull up to the front like [?]
I’m the man of the year, maybe you heard of me
I’m the man with the bands, maybe you heard of me
Princess cut diamonds, need surgery
Pull up to the front like [?]

[Outro: Fetty Wap]

I’m the man of the year, maybe you heard of me
