[Intro: Fabolous]
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Murda, Future, Young OG right now
Kiss, hol' up

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I'm still eating, I'm being greedy
I rather that then being needy
Camera man tryna TMZ me
Side piece tryna PND me
Right now I'm too cautious
Thirsty hoes get two Vosses
You with a loser that's two losses
Dripping off me, I'm too saucy
Off white on a off night
Givenchy lay on a laundry day
Soft whites going off right
These diamonds shine like light bulbs
My shoe closet like flight club
Treat your ass like the athletes
Might hit it when I leave the night club
I don't trust them either, I don't blame Metro
Fuck with OG, not a lame retro
Told you from the get go, let's go, get go, get low
Couple niggas betting against us, that's no bet tho
If Brooklyn don’t trust you like what’s up with son’
They throw bullets where I’m from make you cough up a lung
If ain't no bad bitches in there I pull up with some
And right now I’m on some kush and a cup of som’n

[Hook: Future]
100 shooters in the club, 100 bottles
100 shooters in the club, 100 bottles nigga
Coppin the whips on these niggas
Don't fuck, don't fuck, don't fuck with these niggas
Ain't got no love for these niggas
No love, no love, no love for these niggas
I just blow the cash on my young hoe
I just blow some cash on my young hoe
Fuckin' up this cash with my young niggas
Fuckin' up a bag with my young niggas

[Verse 2: Uncle Murda]
Oh I just ran off on the plug (twice)
If you ain't getting money, you a dub
I'm lit right now, Fab and Kiss on the remix right now
For a bag of bricks, I hit you like Rico hit Mitch right now
Got pills on me, got loud on me, got powder
She got a period, so she want suck it for a hour
She nasty with it, want me to put it in her anus
She my Blac Chyna, my Amber Rose, she a stripper, I'mma make her famous
Got a rollie I ain't paid for piece hittin' right now
Get the pyrex, get the baking soda, I'mma whip it, right now
I'm whats up right now, I'm Fat Joe, all the way up right now
If Future don't trust it, bang bang, I'mma shot you up right now

[Bridge: Future]
If Murda don't trust you he gon' shoot you
Lil' Mexico don't trust you we gon shoot you
Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon shoot you
If Brooklyn don't trust you, they gon shoot you

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I don't rep nothing my nigga, I'm neutral
D-Block, any conflict and I'm making it crucial
If Jada don't trust you then Kiss is gon' shoot you
Funeral on Tidal, the wake is on Youtube
What they do, they selling hard, puffing wet
Messing with the credit cards, bustin' checks
Pumping in the jets, dumping off the Tec's
Hopping on the yachts, jumpin' off the jets
Like

[Hook: Future]
I just blow the cash on my young hoe
I just blow some cash on my young hoe
Fuckin' up this cash with my young niggas
Fuckin' up some bands with my young niggas
100 shooters in the club, 100 bottles
100 shooters in the club, 100 bottles
Coppin the whips on these niggas
Don't fuck, don't fuck, don't fuck with these niggas
Ain't got no love for these niggas
No love, no love, no love for these niggas

[Outro]
