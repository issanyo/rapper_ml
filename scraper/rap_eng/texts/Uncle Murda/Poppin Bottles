Popping the bottles, sight of dust (puff puff pass)

But watch for the stick up kids right in the club

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Yea, ice over a hundred thousand
You poppin' bottles and blowing loud
You throwin' it up, you summer style
LV everythin', brand new age belt
Low homie sure it came with the safe belt
Cause the jack boys, 'bout to make this ice melt
Pretty bitches all over you
When you leave the club, shit is all over for you
They be stashed between the Benz and the Rover for you
They ain't even get that drunk, they stay sober for you
See that bitch he was dancing with?
Guess you up on some you was looking handsome shit
And now they got you on some real and some shit
You gon die if you don't motherfuckin' answer shit
A pretty bitch is the jack boy girlfriend
I see money and bitches that make your world end

[Verse 2: Styles P]
You need  ring the bells, you get mad though
Got the cars and the bitches, niggas the clap though
You connected over the map though
Niggas in the hood know that you being getting crack though
You want that label, you boss nigga
You can put 'em on or get 'em off nigga (okay)
You can sell 'em hard or sell 'em soft nigga
The first minute you slip, you off nigga
The corpse nigga
Would 'bout six feet deep or popping bottles in the hood spot
Coming through with a good chain, good watch
Shit you wore a goodie and a Glock in the G shop?
Cause the B's pop? and the C's pop?
I'm all good, it's the OG from D block
Watch when you party and you shine on 'em
Stick up kids with bodies and they got 9's on 'em

[Hook: Uncle Murda]
