[Hook: Uncle Murda]
Oh they don’t really want no drama
Man they better stop playing with me
Had em deliver bad news to your mama
Miss, I told em stop playing with me
Lil homie ain’t stand a chance
I walked away doing the “I just caught a body” dance
Ah, ah, I just caught a body dance
I walked away doing the “I just caught a body” dance

[Verse 1: Uncle Murda]
Not the one to play with, yeah that’s my new name
In the club for dolo, they gon take whose chain?
Not the one to play with, yeah that’s my nickname
Shawty fell in love with me, blame it on the dick game
Her little box ain’t stand a chance
Hopped out doing the “I bodied the pussy” dance
Not the one to play with, rest in peace if you play with me
You getting money round here, not ok with me
Not the one to play with, I get it for the low low
Talking 24, Charles nigga’s 44 though
My bricks getting stepped on, that’s a no no
The fiends love my work like Puerto Ricans love Cotto
Not the one to play with, like Suge in the 90s
Look around, ain’t nothing but real niggas behind me
Not the one to forgive, [?] I ain’t forget
I’m still gone ride on them niggas that got Biggie hit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
Talking bout bodies, we just caught another one
Now my trap hot, we gotta move before the warrant come
Youngin, athlete, we got to throw away another gun
Tell these nigga’s mom they got to throw away another son
Talking bout guns, nigga we just brought another drum
Hungry son, looking for these niggas with my Shmoneys son
Tweeting some', hit that nigga up and watch a [?] run
Squeeze a gun, Quavo smoked that nigga for the week ago
Not the one to play with, I live that [?] life
Not the one to play with, Freddy Kruger on the late night
Not the one to play with, Imma hit you and like eight guys
Not the one to play with, shoot these niggas broad daylight
Not the one to play with, cause I’m not the one to play with
Not the one to play with, cause that gun, bitch I stay with
Not the one to play with, cause my last name Shmurda
Not the one to play with, cause my uncle’s named Murda

[Hook]
