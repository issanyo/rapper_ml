Fuck talkin' 'bout substance it don't mean nothin'
They don't listen they ain't buyin' so poison the public
Don't tell about jail, dont tell 'em it's whack
Don't tell 'em they bendin' over and showin' they crack
Don't tell 'em they makin' laws targetin' blacks
Like two bricks is the same as a fifty in crack
[?] judges and lawyers
They don't need no evidence that's the government for you
So cop that car, nigga buy out the bar
Get white boy wasted you a rockstar
Keep lookin' for love inside of the club
Sayin free my nigga, you ain't even send him a dub
But you just blew ten in twenties and tens
Keep fuckin' with them niggas who gon tell on you when
The feds come through and sweep up the block
Leave that bitch who say she ridin' with you knowin' she not
Keep rappin bout money knowin' you [?]
Fuck investin' in tomorrow and fuck buyin' a stock
Blow money on bitches that's gon leave when you're broke
Out in vegas hit the strip up with strippers and coke
Nigga ball until you fall and fuck stackin' a stash
For a rainy day and go make it rain on some ass
Fuck buyin a house go get that drop [?]
Have a baby by that bitch that gave the whole block head
Shoot 'em [?] get a little street cred
Fuck the feds, come home nigga get more bread
If you a real nigga go do what i said
Be real dumb and end up real dead
