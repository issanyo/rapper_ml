Hey you don’t know what you got until you lose it
Hey you don’t know what you got until it’s gone

[Hook]
We all came up the same way
Then grew apart in the same way
It’s kinda strange how the money and material things
Give a nigga a tad he can’t play
I remember I used to slain yay
But then with them bills I ain’t paid
So who’s to blame when society don’t want you to change
They just want you to maintain plain

[Verse 1]
You know, blame my environment for how I act
You know my neighborhood

We started from nothing
We was poor
I had too much ambition
And I wanted more
School and a regular job wasn’t gonna cut it
Lil brother stealing money out my grandmama’s purse
How I’m gonna be for him and try to explain things
He probably got it from me
I used to do the same thing
I see the pain in her face
I know she hurting
We can’t keep doing that to her that ain’t gonna work
So we got that work and we made it work
Now instead of taking money, we put money in her purse
‘Fore she go to church

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You know society set up for us to fail
They give us poor education
They want us to go to jail

I was at the bottom like what the fuck?
Looking at the top like that’s a long way up
I ain’t scared of heights, homie, so I got to climbing
I come from a dark place, now looking to shining
Only thing I’m scared of is God and the feds
Lost a lot of close friends and they ain’t even dead
‘fuck the same page, we ain’t even reading the same book
Homie you ain’t struggled with me
You wasn’t there with me
Niggas that I start with is eatin’ Mr. Chow wit me
I don’t want my kids knowing nothing about no welfare
Tell the government we don’t need none of that fake healthcare
They can keep their healthcare

[Hook]
