I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them

[Verse 1 - Maino]

[Verse 2 - Uncle Murda]
I'ma go harder than them, murder the heart of the streets
I'ma go harder than Drake, harder than Drake vs Meek
I'ma go harder than Puff, I'ma go harder than Diddy
Harder than when he was tryna tell us Sean gon be the next Biggie
I'ma go harder than Pac, when he thought Big had him shot
Harder than Dame, he ain't did shit when he left the Roc
I'ma go harder than Nas....
.....  Let the truth be told , woah
Tell all these niggas I'm back, Maino just passed me a mac
If I shoot you and you dont die, dont rat just try to shot me back
When it's bang time, I get shit poppin thought he was reachin
He was milly-rockin, did that shit on the wrong block
Bang - Bang , My lil homie shoot'em

[Hook]
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
