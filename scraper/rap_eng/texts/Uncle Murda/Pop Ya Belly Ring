[Intro:]
Ladies and gentlemen
Please report on the dance floor
Thugs and thuggets, goons and goonettes
We gonna take this worldwide
I go by the name of Wyclef
UM, you got your passport man?

[Verse 1:]
First stop Paris, come on tale vous
Hotel rooms lookin like the Moulin Rouge
We're from BK, servin the metties
To London, getting knighted in the palace
Konichiwa, out in Japan now
She gave gooch and molly, Asian girls poppin mollies
Bugattis in, she say her daddy on it
Oh he a Russian mobster and he don't shake the codeine

[Bridge:]
Habibi baby, you smoking hashis
Let's put it in the hookah, we in the middle east
Arivederci, wake up in Sicily
Them belissime don that is feeling me

[Hook 1:]
Pop pop that belly ring, pop it as Rihanna
Pop pop that belly ring, Shakira, Columbia
Pop pop them bottles, go pop them choppers
There's some pretty ladies in here
Those my future baby mamas

Clap clap clap clap

Hustle doctor, she come from Pakistan
She got that good thing that come from Afghanistan
So all the ladies, let me see you pop yo belly ring
Pop pop yo belly ring

So all the ladies, let me see you pop your belly ring
Pop pop yo belly ring
Pop pop yo belly ring

[Verse 2:]
Heyo UM, I'm back, I'm back on my real rap
I'm on LL, don't call this a comeback
Saka fair, I'm with the gods
You goon duffle, put the Cleopatra squad
I'm going hard, that's that Brooklyn in me
Richmond, New Jersey, you know that Brick City
That girl, won't even mess with the bosses
So she ridin with me on Arabian horses
It's November, we be gone in April
The D got a solid, now she callin me Django
Try albino, rugals, euros
The chrome, the euros, she get everything plural

[Hook 2:]
Pop pop that belly ring, pop it as Rihanna
Pop pop that belly ring, look at Hannah, Bermuda
Pop pop them bottles, go pop them choppers

[Verse 3:]
Pop yo belly shepherd stones
Tingle and you run em put
With some willingness to kill it
You don't care and yes we did it
Burma you bloody style, feds keep a solid file
Cleopatra Warner Brother, keep a drop in the pon

[Hook 2:]
Pop pop that belly ring, pop it as Rihanna
Pop pop that belly ring, look at Hannah, Bermuda
Pop pop them bottles, go pop them choppers
There's some pretty ladies in here

But tonight we gonna pop the braman out the choppas
