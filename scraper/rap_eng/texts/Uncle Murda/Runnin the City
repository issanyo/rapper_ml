These kids feelin themselves they must be high or some'n
Then I step to 'em they like what up son!

Then we rob these niggas they like wh-wh-what's this all about
My man heard you talkin slick yeah that's what happened
Now we violatin y'all for actin like it can't happen
The jokes on y'all you see all the chicks laughin

I know how it feels to win I know it feels to lose
My Gettin Money Gangstas I run with the realest crew

I ain't just rappin know why I get at you
I'll hit yo' punk ass up 'fore I hit at you
I know you heard of Murda I ain't shootin and missin dude
They said I'm an animal I'm uncontrollable
I ain't like these rap cats I'll put a hole in you
These streets said the same thing yeah they know it to
That's why they embrace me they know what I'm goin through
People in the hood like Murda you killin 'em
I used to bump they shit but now I ain't feelin 'em
I only bump yo' shit your songs more realler son
You should change your name to Uncle Murda The Killer son
You ain't like Jay you know he that drug dealer son
You that BK boy with that finger on the trigger son
Cause they know it that ego gettin bigger son
But that's aight cause right now you that nigga son
You that new boss you the boss of the East Coast
When I go to L.A. I'm keepin my heat close
