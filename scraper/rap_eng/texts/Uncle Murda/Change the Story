[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
We was partners from the start
Hurt my heart that you're not here
And it's all cause you my dog
This one thought brought me to tears
Anytime I squad I call
We show balls and how to fear
Now your name highlights the wall
There they reach rest in peace yes deceased
I can't believe you're really here no more
Because in my mind, at any second you'll come through the door
It's all in my mind
I see you waiting on this miracle
Cause I know in time
I meet you, greet you in the physical
So I take flight
And we stay high
I take flight
And we stay high

[Hook: Krayzie Bone]
There's no good explanation why your time had to run out
I can't believe that you're gone now
I think of you like you're still around
I call your name but there's no sound
Stop, look, listen
There's no sound
Hope God will make it clear one day, why he took you away from me
I wish I could rewrite the way

I wish there was a way to change the story
(X5)
It's crazy

[Verse 2: Uncle Murda]
I really miss my dog
Can't believe that he not here
Had a conversation with God
Told him this shits not fair
I don't wanna pray
I don't do none of that
I don't go to church
Lookin' in my main mother face and his mother look so hurt
Lookin' at his little brother
His little brother look just like him
His brother be with the shits
Little niggas in the hood scared to fight him
Miss how we used to get away when the punk police try to chase us
We ain't have hotel money
We was fuckin' bitches in the staircases
Right next to them track fans whatever you should serve them customers
Nosey neighbors calling police on us all the time
They ain't fuck with us
Can't wait til we meet again
Man you know a nigga gotta kick it with you
Tell then I'm just out here gettin' turnt up, gettin' rich with you

[Hook: Krazyie Bone]

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
Yeah
Now come and talk me, dock me
When I put my foot up in that moss man
All of my lost friends, I never lost them
Little Capo died, right before Ruthless
Took his twin daughters to see the casket
Carry my nigga, don't lose em'
Now the diva's that buried him
Breath smelling like maryam
Death is a bad word
With a bad verse that's scarin' em'
One of my best friends wanted to change the world
It was a blessing
That's right before I lose him
Where's the doctor? I'm his best man
Tears in the presence of holy ashes and presence on they asses to the deaden they lifeless to the them its Heaven, priceless, word to the Sevens, Nina Ross, and all of them
