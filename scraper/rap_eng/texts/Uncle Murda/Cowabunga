Yelling cowabunga

Bitch go eat a dick

Cuz I am on a wave I'm going



Surf the tides or get washed

By the shores



I am on a wave I'm going up



00 in ya hoe

Act like ya know...

We talk that

Cowabunga cowabunga



Yelling cowabunga

When the money flip

Yelling cowabunga

When I'm high homez

Yelling cowabunga

When she surf the dick

Silver surf surf surf surf'n

Cuz i am on a wave I'm going up



Ricky Bobby watch me shake n bake

Cross stepping

Hanging 10 christ medina aye



Fist pumping

We don't pump the brakes

Its jungle city eat ya wheaties

Boy best get ya weight up



Test the pussy

Never testify

Dawn patrol'n

Watch em lurk'n on it night and day



That duck diving

Girl it need to stop

No I just can't be ya genie

Can't you see me

Got that money on my mind



Too live bitch I'm uncle Luke

(whoa whoa)

Snootie tootie fruity

(whoa whoa)

Up in daisy dukes

Feel a lil Richard

Help me plead my case

They can not see me

But wan be me man

All I can say is ah



Altitude I'm too in my groove

No paddle puss'n ride the tide

Surf the party wave

She acting like a fan

Better check ya ma'am

Big cahownah

You don't stand a chance

She coming up



Yelling cowabunga

When the money flip

Yelling cowabunga

When I'm high homez

Yelling cowabunga

When she surf the dick

Cuz I am on a wave I'm going up



I am on a wave I'm going up

Silver surf surf surf surf'n

Cowabunga cowabunga
