[Chorus:]
I got so much to lose
But I got so much to prove oh
And i die for the shit
Im tryna get it it ain't over til i get it
I'm just tryna pour up
Drive a four in my Spider get my night away
All i need is more money
And we make my shooters take your life away
Hey, Tryna Get it

[Verse 1:]
Growing up I ain't had nothing but beef in the streets
CBD way i was creeping with he
Now its team lady these bitches be going crazy
Can't stop til my moms is pushing that new mercedes
But lately Ive been feeling like Mike jack
Im thriller Im thriller man you can't get that light back
These niggas woulda start it they like rats
On a coreside with spy cat
I mean they really on a coreside with spikes at
I tell em double down we like that We gon’ get it
Since a youngin making money then i had to flip it
I had to split it with my niggas they was always with me
I had a dollar me and Ty split it 50/50
The definition of a G and you can see it in me
I been to jail been to war ain't no bitching in me
All i see is dollar signs when I’m in that bentley
Team made it we the mob tell them come and get me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
You thought it was bad well it got worse today
I just circulate my circle war in your circulade
We hit the club pouring up and throw like 30k
Then hit the hood and shoot a vid and bring out 30k
Now off the murder way, browns build up the murder rate
No reversal brakes with this drive can't get no verses breaks
Now your life at stake
These my A1 niggas my day one niggas will take your life away
I don't know who gon’ die next
Bloods killing bloods like homie ain't down my set
Lil niggas playing with guns getting killed
Mothers can't afford to bury their sons (she on welfare)
I wanna kill a cop and brag about it on Worldstar
And make em pull it up on a tight box
Like GMG and DOD got a cop shot

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Im tryna get it
Put on for the fam
So we can expand it always been  part of the plan
Well fuck for the gram and no i dnt uck with these bitches
We just stunt on them haters right in front of their bitches
I'm young and i'm gifted
I’m blessed and i'm privileged
Two dead homies want me on i regret i ain't list this
I thought i told them this is more than just the music
Now the dynasty is emerging we made history through the movement
One finger up high
Two guns in the sky
They hoping i fail
Im hoping they die
Got criminal ties
This how criminals fly
In the [?] at night where my criminals cry
KOB the recruiter
DOD is them shooters
The boy tweezie will squeeze
And tell smurda to rooger
Only winners no losers
Drug money abusers
To the top of the world
Need a mountain to move us

[Chorus]
