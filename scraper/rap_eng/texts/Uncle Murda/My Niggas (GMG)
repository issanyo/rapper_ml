[Intro]
That's right baby, DJ Suss One [?]
I'm here with my nigga Uncle Murda
Shout out to the whole east New York
Shout out to the whole GMG
Summertime Shootouts, let's go!

[Verse 1: Uncle Murda]
[x2]My niggas will shoot you
My niggas will rob you
My niggas will cut you
You know how my squad do
My niggas is loco, my niggas is grimy
GMG we're [?] on your wifey.[x2]

Son I got a dope spot, and I got a crack spot
Ever since [?] I've been letting my gat pop
So you wanna be a gangsta? son I got the recipe
You can't roll with me, if you ain't got no felonies
This is for them bloods and the crips who gettin' money
All you broke gang members stay fuck away from me
I ain't about that beef shit if it about no bread
Before I fuck a groupie they gotta give me head
They be on they knees tellin' me how much they like me
You used to be a stripper, oh you can't be my wifey
I be tellin' [?] that they the best
So they can put the order to it when we havin' sex
When I'm in the hood you know the hammers on deck
50 side macs, 32 side tecs
Give me [?], niggas can't roll with us if they only got misdemeanors

[x2]My niggas will shoot you
My niggas will rob you
My niggas will cut you
You know how my squad do
My niggas is loco, my niggas is grimy
GMG we're [?] on your wifey.[x2]

First verse is done. Don't be afraid to suggest more!
