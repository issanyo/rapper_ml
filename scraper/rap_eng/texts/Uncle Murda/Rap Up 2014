[Intro]
2014 was crazy
Woah

[Verse]
I heard Puff put hands on Drake
Troy Ave got the "Tuesday" kid punched in his face
Chris Brown went on Instagram and told us that his girl fucked Drake
The 'Gram took niggas' followers, they violated Mase
They took 1.5 million, I seen that shit
Mase was so embarrassed, he deleted his shit
J. Cole sold three sixty his first week
Nicki broke up with Safaree and start fucking Meek
Lil Wayne don't want to fuck with Baby
But the contract he signed got him stuck with Baby
I say shit that make niggas think
Five niggas told me K. Michelle pussy stink
Seen Bobby Shmurda on Jimmy Fallon
Jimmy Kimmel, now they got him on Riker's Island
Free the whole GS9
The law hate seeing niggas shine
What they won't say, Im'ma write it
Two cops got killed cause two cops ain't get indicted
They took Eric Garner, shot Mike Brown in the head
And now two innocent cops is dead
And real talk, that's not what's up
The KKK laughing like "ha, that wasn't none of us"
That probably went over your head
Y'all rather talk about Bill Cosby instead
Or Jay and Solange in the elevator
Do ya know the police upset with the mayor?
Cause he supported the protest
The revolution coming, people just don't know it yet
They know what happened on Love & Hip Hop
Don't know what Young Thug said but still think his shit hot
The realest yearly rap up you ever heard
I'm just stating a few facts and some shit that I heard
G-Unit back together minus The Game
At Summer Jam on stage, niggas took Slow chains
Then Slowbucks tried to set it on Fab and 'em
Cause they was on stage when it happened, they was mad at him
I got to talk about this shit
I'm still bugging now how Angie made that Power switch
Amber and Wiz going through that divorce now
The other day, I seen her twerking on Chris Brown
Suge got shot in the club in front of Chris Brown
Then they tried to say it was meant for Chris Brown
T.I. swung on Floyd and 'em
Rest in peace to Earl Hayes, I did a song with him
Rest in peace to his wife
He killed her then took his own life
Boosie home, Remy back home
LeBron left Miami and went back home
That Ebola had niggas shook
Ray Rice knocked out his wife with the left hook
French got a Kardashian under them sheets
My nigga Jeezy and Rick Ross deaded their beef
But everybody beefing with Iggy
Dre & Jimmy sold Dre Beats for 3 billi
The realest yearly rap up you ever heard
I'm just stating a few facts and some shit that I heard

[Outro]
Yo know
You need people like me so you could
Point your finger at and say
"That's the bad guy"
Yeah
2015, what's good
GMG
ATM
New Money
Woah
It's the Rap Up
Brooklyn
