[Outro]
Person 1: You know guys like me and you gotta kick it here, old school
Person 2: Yeah, this is, this is truly old school
Person 1: Definitely old school (Definitely old school)

[Hook: Kno and Deacon]
Yo, Yo
We keep the par-ty so live
To all my Fellas
We keep the par-ty so live
To all My ladies
We keep the par-ty so live
CunninLynguistics
We see the par-ty so live

[Kno]
Get live, set to destroy all the fakers
'Cus this ones for the B-Boys and the breakers
Take ya, to another level with the sound (sound)
Freaking the flow, Deacon and Kno getting down
Take it all back to the essence
When you could go to a party and not leave with your head split
(Yeah It's)
Cunninlynguists getting live
Respect the foundation, the hip-hop vibe

[Deacon]
Now get up get up
Gonna rip up rip up
Any motherfucker if they don't shut they shit up
Puts your hands up like it's a stick up
I got ya head jerking like some hiccups
Its Deacon the Villain
Ill'in' with my nigga rolls
Rappers be soft, they probably walk on their tippy toes
Word up Jays game, and roll diggy (Go)
Flows potent, even my breath smells like sticky dro

[Hook]

[Deacon]
Im chillin' the French way, I'm not the best
But more or less, the style is (finesse)
For those that test, I shake em down like bumpy nuts
Smashed out their face, even slam it like a dummy cut
(Ohhhhhh!)
Yo
(Hold up!)
Kentucky shogun
Who's the master
(Showed up)
Ya damm right, deep in the last dragon
Flows off the wall like they outlaw tagging

[Kno]
Understand me when I tell you this
I got the style that'll give you fits
And get you pissed that ya can't rhyme like this
Hype with the type of shit that leave ya hyper tense
(Get down!)
When ya feel it dont be acting stiff
(Get down!)
Just go on ahead and grab a chick
(Get down!)
Do that dance a bit, before ya hit her
(Get down!)
(Thats that shit)

[Hook]

[Deacon]
Yo I'm a, gun and uh (BOOOOM!)
Cocked and ready
Quick to leave ya head spinning like rocksteady
Get mistaken for a B-Boy breaking your dome
Off the planet like I've been turboed out the O-Zone
The rap Roy Jones you better be ducking and weaving
Take a breath so quick you're bound to be sucking your teeth in
When Kno's on the 1200's, cutting and bleeding
When I'm stuck in my broom like it ain't nothing and leaning

[Kno]
I just ripped the mic and crushed Cataclysmic
Blast a sentence that would leave a rapper limping
Nowadays cats only rhyme about their bankroll
But I've been fresh ever since fuzzy Kangol
(Hey Yo)
Dont y'all be starting nothing
Just chill the hell out while we keep the party jumping
I know what's got you feelin' nice
Me and my man Deacon the Villian illin' keeping it live
