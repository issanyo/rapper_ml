Army of the Pharaohs, Celph Titled, let's do this, what, what, yeah, yo
Well if 50 got shot nine times and ain't die
I'mma shoot your ass fifty times with 99 nines
Throw knives, daggers and darts, ya'll just faggots at heart
You can try to run home boy I throw javelins far (Yeah!)
This is the Army but we don't rock camouflage
We'll dress you up in a suit made out of bandage gauze
Barnes and Noble rappers
Yeah you far from crooks
You was charging books at the same time my charge was booked
Give me a harder look and I'll slaughter all of ya'll
No hands and no feet you lucky to be crawlin' off
Your next birthday call it off (Why?)
Cause I got party favors with an open bar servin' molotovs
Some say I'm gangsta rap, others say I'm horror core
I say I'm Suge Knight at the '95 Source Awards
We swingin' swords for sure
You better gather yourself
After my verse fuck face that's what the chorus for

[Demoz]
Demoz, Demoz, Demoz
It's the Army of the Pharaohs
I don't fear junkies the Feds want me, it's the Costa Rican Ted Bundy
Desert Eagle on my waist, fuck some bread monkeys
Touch my commissary hungry yous a dead bunky
You get buried in dirt, I'll McFlurry your earth
I'll let off like January the first
Leave 'em lit like the 4th of July you either forfeit or die
Knife in your throat with a fork in your eye
Me and Vinnie spit amity rap
I bring life to the game, I'm sixteen like a battery pack
Get your whole fucking cavity cracked
Get your family clapped, I shotgun your whole family splat
That's your fucking son face on the wall
You got Satan involved look I ain't got no patience at all
Retaliation is the key to compete so when you see me don't reach
Get low like you're cleaning your sneaks, motherfucker!

[Vinnie Paz]
Yo, yo
I'm the resurrection of Leather face
I am the shotty at his head and waist
Then wrap his body up in plastic leave him dead in lakes
I told you rappers Vinnie Paz is worse than seven snakes
I'm a statue spittin' venom at you at the heavens gates
It's black magic when I'm rapping' I can levitate
Murk your whole entire rapping faction, cousin, set a date
It's the only word describing Pazienza devastate
I'm clappin' now while asking questions later I don't hesitate
I'm not concerned with human lives so you can vegetate
How many pounds of pressure does it take for human legs to break?
My blood lust is never quenched it's like an endless chase
I'll show you the mathematics of God and quickly end your faith
Celph, where the Desert Eagle cousin, shred his face
Show them the type of carnage that bullets in the head creates
We the reason that rappers never enter several states
And the reason that Darwin separated men from apes
