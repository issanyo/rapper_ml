[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
Yo
I hold rappers hostage
Spit saliva that's toxic
From the NYC to the FLA tropics
AR-15 schizo, make your chest blow
Nothing to say like Greg Nice without the echo
I'm a cross between C-4 and C-3PO
Explosive intelligence, pack the heavy metal
Out the window with that demo that you tried to sell me
I'd rather listen to a Rob Base comeback LP
It's not healthy for you to come around here with that
Run your mouth off like that, and get your wig pushed back like that
I'll make you swallow the grenade
And put an envelope and stamp in your hand
And mail the pin to Afghanistan
What I say makes sense in the mind frame I'm in
While you babble on like the Mediterranean
Throw you down the escalator just to sterilize you
Deranged doctor, with the scalpel to slice through
Anyone who contest, my clique hard as nails
It'll be a done deal like Mobb Deep on sale
Escaped convict putting out mob hits
You probably a homo and shave your armpits

[Verse 2: Apathy]
We rock on the Breeze Block
MCs drop when hitting weak spots
My beats pump like shotguns and Reeboks
You look softer than stuffed animal Ewoks
So we stalk the street blocks
And spit like when fat kids beatbox
Got it locked like Ol' Dirty in detox
We'll never stop like cops going in donut shops
I'd let you rap but you're probably not worthy
And besides it's time to go yo, it's almost 3:30
I give skeletal fractures like wrestling matches
Practice on you rappers if you think that Ap is wacker
From Africa to Alaska, my rap sells faster
While the only distribution y'all got is through Napster
From U.K. to USA we getting play
While you playing everyday for an open mic to display
Your half-ass wack raps you cats design
Y'all can never get signed
What are you, out of your mind
