[Intro: Apathy]
The almighty... Demigodz!
Yo!

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Ever since the big bang, before God had a name
Before the birth of earth or when the dinosaurs came
Way before cavemen were huntin' prehistoric game
Or Cleopatra pumped poison venom in her veins
Before the world changed when the Romans reigned
Before Jesus was slain and Noah watched for rain
'Cause I've been waitin' longer to drop my CD
Then people who wait in line at the DMV

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
Yo, before the Lord himself said, "Let there be..."
There was me, Celph Titled... God MC
No frequencies to transmit, no hammers to grip
No flicks where they was killin' kids on summer campin' trips
Before you was coherent, my flows spirit co-existed in pyramids
Temples of holy lyrics, Homie I'm serious
Before Jehovah thought of y'all
I done payed dues, blown the fuck up, and fallen off (come on)

[Chorus: Apathy (Motive)]
Don't make me
Wait!
What will it
Take!
Let's get this
Straight!
(Demigodz, don't forget it or we gonna bring it!)

[Hook: Ryu]
Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back
Yea!
Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back
Come on!
Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back
Yea!
Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back
Bring it!

[Verse 3: Ryu]
Before tats and the booze, two packs a day shit
In the lunch room battlin' chumps in they faces
Ever since cassettes I was deaf before the phrase
("So fresh"), for my age I needed a fuckin' agent
From out the basement I came when Kane did (uh)
Before K-Swiss was gay kicks for gay kids (I'm sayin')
For the sake of bein' abrasive
I'll slit a ho's throat so the bitch can't say shit

[Verse 4: Motive]
Way before my Moms used to beat me with a switch (chyea!)
Suspended from school for callin' all my teachers a bitch (Bitch!)
Before I used to rock Lee's with the creases that's thick (uh huh)
Only time I dressed up was on Easter and shit (chyea!)
Basically I'm sayin' I've been patiently waitin' a long time (uh)
Before my Pops even thoughta knockin' up my mom (ha)
Before so many fake dudes tried to rhyme (uh huh)
They guarded angels got they ass whooped for stoppin' crimes (chyea!)

[Chorus: Apathy (Motive)]
Don't make me
Wait!
What will it
Take!
Let's get this
Straight!
(Demigodz, don't forget it or we gonna bring it!)

[Hook: Ryu]
Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back
Yea!
Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back
Come on!
Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back
Yea!
Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back

[Verse 5: Tak]
Before I was even conceived and kickin' the womb
Before I was able to breathe I was diggin' your tomb
Before I even had a style and the clips to fill it with
Before my brother Bilal ever hooked up with Syndicate
I was waitin' in the shack with Everlast before he had the knack
Way before it was cool to wear leather pants
Before sniffin' a line of 'caine left your mind numb
And Def Jef and Etta James dropped rhymes on drums

[Verse 6: Apathy]
Feels like centuries or essentially
Longer then Flava Flav waited for the EMT's
Before O.J. got lucky they lost his fresh prints
Before they tried to switch up the aunts on Fresh Prince
Before Napoleon began to strategize
Or way before McDonald's fucked up they apple pies
Before Capone committed a single crime
Bottom line, I've been waitin' a long fuckin' time

[Chorus: Apathy (Motive)]
Don't make me
Wait!
What will it
Take!
Let's get this
Straight!
(Demigodz, don't forget it or we gonna bring it!)

[Hook: Ryu]
Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back
Yea!
Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back
Come on!
Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back
Yea!
Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back...
