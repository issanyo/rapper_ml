"It's nothing" - Guru

[Verse One] [Rise]
I brush off dust
Move on, live with regrets
The old stuff for so long, givin' me stress
Cause that's what other people do
But color me confused
If the grass was always greener where the other people grew
I used to want my feet strapped in other people's shoes
Wishin' that I knew what the other people knew
Or I could do what the other people do
And now I'm number one and all the other people twos
It's i-ronic
My mind went bi-onic
Then one Rise sonnet and then you'll be in my vomit
I told you dinosaurs died from my comet
But still when I rhyme they applaud for my comment
"Thank you very much"
It's over, don't try and pretend
I'm droppin' in 2014 where the calender's end
Most will balance quiet trains say a listener will kill
I caribou slain and Rise is for real

[Verse Two] [Celph Titled]
If I could fit my anger into one capsule
I'd be prescribed it
Give it to rappers, to see what type of shit they writtin'
And if it's like mine, then I'm not that sick
But chances are, it's nothin' like mine and that's it
I'm on that shit
No pen when I write this
I don't want arthritis
So in my head I paint bars like janitors at Riker's
I got a fertilizer bomb underground
Make me mad motherfucker I'm pushin' the button down
You'll be in a box
But not in a button down
You'll be ashes in an urn
Cause you faggots didn't learn
Fuckin' with Celph Titled, he's a master of war
The user force is stronger than a magnetic pull
You might witness a horror show
With a bizarrish flow
Gem star to your throat, I'm carvin' slow
Carbon gasses
Mixed with sulfuric acid
Into ro-botics who give futuristic ass whippings

[Verse Three] [Jay Love]
When I spit a 16, I spit it this mean
I stripped it when lifted, with a hit of this green
Bitch
Get off my did-ick, I ain't spittin' shit clean
Every sentence is offensive as a listener's dream
I saw Rise and the guys and slipped in the scene
The Avid is the quarterback and this is the team
Listen to me
It's contagious
He's sick with the beats
Now we all spittin' ill shit, we vicious MCs
Thickets of thieves that caught a buzz without the costs of drugs
Better forfeit cuz than to go to war with us
It's nuts
Crossin' us, get tossed and snuffed
Punched in the gut till you cough up blood and your coffin shuts
You fuckin' mutts ain't got nothin' on the kid
You ain't touchin' what I spit cause I'm somethin' like a pimp
Stop clutchin' on my dick and get the fuck out my face
The name is Jay Love and I'm up out this place
