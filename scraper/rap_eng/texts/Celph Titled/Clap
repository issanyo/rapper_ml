[Intro]
Watch out
He’s coming
He’s coming

[Verse One: Cashmere The PRO]:
I know the freshest way to move you
Put so much dope in the flow
Before I release a single, I need FDA
Approval
You stepped this way to do who?
It’s best you stay in neutral
I’ve got explosives from comp
I eject in they Izuzu
Calicos that shred away they FUBU
And leave you with a penetrated noodle
When I elevate the two-two
See when I play its brutal
You stepping to a 300 pound wolf
And yous just a feather weighted poodle
I won’t hesitate to do you
Fill those properties
The most evil philosophy
Since Satan’s spirit went inside of Socrates
That can lead to more monstrosities
Possibly cause when you rock the ozone
It’s like the crowd turned into apostrophes
(Cashmere)
Make no thing about it
It’s got to be, being Halle's pubic
Is only way you’ll be on top of me
Dough I’m constantly striving to cop the suit to rob with me
Honestly, I’m so sick I need the CDC to market me
And that’s the Bronx in me, taunting me
To big nigga shit, wig splitter shit
Want to hear a peaceful joint, this isn’t it
I’m not happy unless I’m paid and this is a lick
Then I gets ignorant, so expect it lord
There be at least two red corners like a checkerboard
The rest are floored, no way to detect the raw
My album bang, by the last track your neck get sore

[Hook]
"Clap, don’t applaud" - M.O.P. 'Everyday'
"When I rap, don’t wait to clap, applaud sooner" - Nas 'Too Hot'
"Make ‘em clap to this" - Eric B & Rakim 'Eric B. Is President'
"Clap, don’t applaud"
"Make ‘em clap to this"
"Thought I clapped guns, but my guns applaud" - Redman 'W.K.Y.A.'
"Clap, don’t applaud"
"When I rap, don’t wait to clap, applaud sooner"
"Make ‘em clap to this"
"Clap, don’t applaud"
"Make ‘em clap to this"
"Thought I clapped guns, but my guns applaud"

[Verse Two: Oktober]
Yo, there’s a lot of guns clapping from city to city nowadays
Thugs are gritty and willing to go out in a blaze
Late night, guns go pop where the violence is
Wake the whole block, we can’t afford silencers
Popping out here with gun play
Even model bitches get clapped in the Time Square subway
In broad day, popping for thousands to witness
Get clapped shopping in the diamond district
I stared down the barrel of my uncle’s rifle
He had a scope on it with a little red light too
My crew used to bring guns to Catholic school
Shirt and tie with a 22 strapped to the shoe
Nah, I don’t even hit kids, kill them rugrats
Wait until they get big so they can feel the gun clap
If you decide to cross the line that your life is on
You better be holding and I don’t mean a microphone

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Celph Titled]
I’m a real live loose cannon with a loose cannon
Explosive genius, making bombs out of tooth laminate
Walked into the church and let my mother fucking gun spray
Pissed the fuck off cause Chic-Fil-A’s closed on Sunday’s
Back up my life and then easily delete yours
Go against the grain like I got beef with a feed store
Locked in the bing, I’m sticking CO’s with oxes
Should have been a postal worker, putting PO’s in boxes
My hands write murderous notebooks
So Jehovah took those so shook soldiers
Who claim they so hard but ain’t no
Crooks
My face turn green from the light inside the night scope
In grassy knolls and hoods, right next to the white folks
I got you walking tight ropes, you might hope
That Celph Titled is not who he seems to be
I eagerly wait with heaters with beams aimed deeply
Where your people be
Your local eatery’s not safe no more
Until my desert eagle sprays no more

[Hook]

(Celph Titled) Yeah, Celph Titled, the mother fucking Rubix Cuban

(Oktober) Yeah, Oktober the zero, about to pass the heat to Cashmere
Yo, Cash, don’t leave that laying around, you know how we do, you know how Celph start acting with them things, haha

(Celph Titled) Noah on the mother fucking beat, yeah, we going to make ‘em clap to this one, Tampa to the BX, p-on and all that, you know what I mean, let’s do this shit, watch your neck piece
