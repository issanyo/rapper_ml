[Intro: Celph Titled]
And god said let there be Celph Titled
45 King drop the beat on them
Fuck all that shit you talkin'
Not now but right now
NYC, Tampa Bay, whole universe

[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
Yo the Don Juan klepto destructo
Out for the gusto
Celph Titled let the guns blow
Call yourself a thug I don't think so
Put the heavy metal to your torso and yell out "Bingo!"
I'm on some sick shit with a cannibal's thought
Skeletons in my closet with no secrets to hide
I'll pull out the biscuit and hold it by the barrel
And beat you senseless 'til I expose your bone marrow
Maximum blaze frequency cause your skin to boil
The only way you'd have a hit record is if I smacked it for you
Uncanny lung compartments from the God body department
With microphone enlargements
Directly from the Chrome Depot
The gun nursery
Bring nooses to the court house and have a hung jury
I'm dumb nice, fatal with one slice
Caribbean rum spice, the vampire and sunlight
Medallion
The ice real icon
I bet you wet the bed if you don't sleep with lights on
You mad pussy, like when Lil' Kim gets agitated
You had a chance to pull the trigger and you hesitated

[Hook]
Yo who the fuck want it?
(Not now but right now)
If you got it better flaunt it
(Not now but right now)
If I see it I'mma pawn it
(Not now but right now)
(Not now but right now)
(Not now but right now)
All my nigga's gonna wile out
(Not now but right now)
Got a problem pull your nine out
(Not now but right now)
Don't know? Better find out
(Not now but right now)
(Not now but right now)
(Not now but right now)

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
Need some advice?
Here's a hollow tip
I make you give fellatio to the chrome and fuckin' swallow it
I roll with cats that'll rob you clean, all or nothin'
Dig up your grave if we thought we forgot something
Fuck hip hop I'm just an MC which stands for
Motherfuckin' coroner what you think my hands are for?
You fantasize about exotic women while I'm fuckin' one
I'm really threatenin' enough to make a paraplegic get up and run
What you gonna do with that? Nothin'
Better put the tool away before I cut your head off cum muffin
Bitches be like, "Where the fuck this nigga come from?"
I've been on the low with all my dons makin' love songs
Shatter your jaw to pieces
Now you speak in broken English
You defeat me and make history
I charge one hundred G's a track, my shit thump
Better pay me upfront or you won't be here next month
You wouldn't fuck with me if you were invincible
Think your shit is hot, but it's deaf as in unlistenable
Always keep the clip loaded so I can buck things
Niggas act platinum but flash small bills like ducklings
You spent doe on these bitches while I hustle women
These rappers couldn't get a deal if they was Russell Simmons
I hold it down for my Floridians
Rep the New York City and
Step close get blown in to oblivion

[Hook]
Yo who the fuck want it?
(Not now but right now)
If you got it better flaunt it
(Not now but right now)
If I see it I'mma pawn it
(Not now but right now)
(Not now but right now)
(Not now but right now)
All my nigga's gonna wile out
(Not now but right now)
Got a problem pull your nine out
(Not now but right now)
Don't know? Better find out
(Not now but right now)
(Not now but right now)
(Not now but right now)

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
Yo when I step in to the place every single bitches jaw drops
Settle my own disagreements while you call cops
There ain't no contest here, it's just a bunch of flukes
You find me landin' of your roof with a parachute
Neatly arrange the corpses and set a deadline
Fuck my last words, one hundred years ago I said mine
Eloquently put I'm ill, so peep the sequel
In the Celph Titled Bible, every man's cremated equal
Speak of the Devil red
I beat the Reaper with a shovel head
And said, "You not on my level yet."
Respect me it's mutual but cross me it's funeral
I take what's suitable but after that it's non recoupable
I'm raw dawg relentless
The only way you could represent the streets
Is if you got poured into the cement mix
This is all live
Motherfuck a DAT tape
I stack weight and let the Mac spray until your back break
Niggas talk shit but in my face plead the fifth
Turn into faggot motherfuckers when I clench my first
Beyond thee unclassified, I'm not Earth related
You couldn't rip mics if they were perforated

[Hook]
Yo who the fuck want it?
(Not now but right now)
If you got it better flaunt it
(Not now but right now)
If I see it I'mma pawn it
(Not now but right now)
(Not now but right now)
(Not now but right now)
All my nigga's gonna wile out
(Not now but right now)
Got a problem pull your nine out
(Not now but right now)
Don't know? Better find out
(Not now but right now)
(Not now but right now)
(Not now but right now)
