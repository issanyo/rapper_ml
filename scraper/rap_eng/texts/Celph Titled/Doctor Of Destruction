[Intro]
Yeah, they know my name all over the world man
Celph Titled, the motherfucking Doctor of Destruction
Le Greck on the beat lets go

[Bridge]
Tick, tick, tock
The sound of my Glock
Boogie, bang the boom, the sound of my Glock
Now everybody listen up, check one two
This is a lyrical terrorist manifesto

[Verse 1]
If I ain't insane yet, no need to call the doctor
Im the doctor of destruction with the Glock to your mouth (Say something)
Fuck with us you got no options
No spinal cord, no lungs, no oxygen
Pop off like its a Holocaust
I get paid just to give a shout, so I'll let you know, what a hollow cost
I'm a boss hog, y'all spit hard washed
Hit you with a soft ball harder than PING golf balls
Paintball gun loaded with marbles, they'll leave a scar
Headshots, no trip to Hollywood, but you'll see some stars
You'll need total protection, like a bodyguard
It's pump fire like playlists with Bobby guns(?)
I had guns at, the Reggae Sunsplash
Fucking dimes, using beef patty napkins for a cum rag
You know I keep a gat on me
That'll leave permanent marks like Kat Von D

[Hook] x2
I supply the supplier
I snipe the sniper
Call me scion
He is I, and I am him
I am, the Doctor of Destruction

[Verse 2]
My anti-gravity pull, will lift back a thug
Throw bones you best believe I will get rappers snug
I'm retarded ill, somewhat stupid sick
I'm bound to show you what a military movement is
Polarise the weather bitch
Cause when I let loose, my anger is distinctively an extinction level event
The monster in my closet stays there cause he fears me
I'm strange but I'mma show you how weird weird be
Actors and reporters, I'm hacking your organs
Im a boss you act like im not important
Take somebody else with my flow, my lines, my voice, my grind
You think you know someone? You out your fucking mind
Push you down the sewer drain, tell your bitch ass to pipe down
Blast a Kumo-D, how you like me now?
And you couldn't find a sicker writer
Even if they had meningitis and was wearing salmonela diapers

[Hook] x2

[Bridge]
