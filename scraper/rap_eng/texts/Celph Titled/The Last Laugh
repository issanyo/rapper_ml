[Intro]
"Wow"
"What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future?
Do we become assholes or something? - Back To The Future II

[Celph Titled]
First off I plan to hurt y'all
So catch a curve ball
Deform your face like Bobby Brown's berserk jaw
You're just too small
Like an ant to an elephant
My X-rays a Woolly Mammoth skeleton
Mega large, bigger than life
Bigger than death
Bigger than Dolly Parton's jiggling breasts
We get in your chest (yes)
Rippin' skin and diggin' in flesh
Ligament stretch
Instruments injure your fisherman vest
We cold lampin' like Alaskan antique shops (what?)
And you don't have to ask Nintendo if we/Wii hot (huh?)
Oh, you short and stout
Just a little tea pot?
Catch a speed knot from size thirteen Reeboks
Threaten me I'll blast the Glock I swear
Or pump your room full of carbon monoxide air
The Baldwin Brother's reunion
With no RSVP
Name another rapper nice as me from the 813

[Hook]
"It's okay"
[MM] We always get the last laugh
[CT] With smoldering flesh under your god damn gas mask
"It's okay"
[MM] Treacherous shit
[CT] Beat you with a chain and pad lock with Tretch wearin' that shit
"It's okay"
[CT] When you see us
[MM] Whoooa, I'm tryin' to make Joey Lawrence head explode
"It's okay"
[CT] Many skulls got ripped
[MM] Shrunken and dried into beef jerky strips

[Majik Most]
Yo Al-Qaeda kiddie porn I make cops swarm
I'm in top form to transform
I'm not Korn
But I'm stuffin' your little cousin like some hot porn
Uh uh uh uh uh
Is this mic on?
An American asshole
Like Jackson at ?
My humor will spray the room away
I make the big Kahuna say
"The sweat back bastard is so funky!"
While I'm set to bone, you're sittin' home
Pumpin' your nasal spray
I'm with Rachael Ray
Makin' a sperm chest souffle
You're too gay
Lance Bass will wave you away
You're findin' bits of rappers in my chewed food
I'm rude dude
Rip a dolphins fins off til it's just a smooth tube
Girls get whoo'd nude when my mood's lewd
Oow, who you?
You'll get booed dude
I'm Majik to the Most you can't be like me
I'll put a baby lemon shark in your sweet ice tea

[Hook]

[Celph Titled]
It's safest to say that we got razors and blades
Hang you like a puppet then cut the cables away
So olay!

[Majik Most]
Oh no way
It's Majik Most with a Mexican hat
Stupid hoes call me Jose

[Celph Titled]
Who else from F.L.A. writes this ill?
Five hours away from where Miami Vice was filmed
I'm like Sonny Crocket in a Ferari gettin' my swerve on
Celph Titled come wack? Motherfuckers heard wrong

[Majik Most]
Word bond, I'm Captain Ron with tight scuba suits on
Killin' all the pirates with knots through their eyelids
Leave the Cabin Boy headless with his bones on my necklace
Then put the captains peg leg on Craig's list

[Celph Titled]
Ayo check this
Destined to be
Like the Karate Kid in Okinawa
What I probably did to your momma
Will leave a kid with a trauma
(That's right)
Best of all
High cholesterol
Doe batter makes my pockets fatter

[Majik Most]
Yo, I'm cutter rappers into cutlets for the public
Then I'm choppin' the cutlets into buckets of nuggets
Ain't nothing above it
Unzip my pants and just tug it
I'm annoying like a John Lovitz puppet but you love it!

"It's okay"
