[Verse One] [Apathy]:
You could catch me in the attic spinnin' static on an ancient phonographic
Or inside a room, inside a womb, blowin' out a prophylactic
Downstairs in lounge chairs
Jerkin' off to pornographic videos with pretty hoes
Seem depressed and sorta tragic
Cause she might be an addict but can't afford the magic
The neighbors bangin' on my walls like "keep down the racket"
My dishes moldy in my sink and they stink
And I think life is flyin' by every time I blink
Like my brain is a runaway train but I'm gonna stay sane
Put the gun away, I'm gonna maintain
I'm in the gutter motherfucker, with the mud and the rain
I'm slicing bodies open, swimmin' through the blood, the guts and the veins

[Scratch Hook]:
"While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse" - Redman 'How High'
"I exist even when no things are left" - Jeru The Damaja 'Ain't The Devil Happy'
"While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse"
"My thoughts are now universes" - Jeru The Damaja 'Ain't The Devil Happy'
"While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse"
"I exist even when no things are left"
"While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse"
"My thoughts are now universes"

[Verse Two] [Motive]:
It's Motive bitches
Niggas, the dopest livin'
My flow is diagnosed with an undeniable sickness
Oh Lord, they sayin' there's no cure
Hardcore, hip hop fans, this is what they hope for
My style like virgin blood
So pure while you the fag on some homosexual's brochure
You rap niggas stop bitchin', I'm tired of hearin' that
You're like a magician performin' disappearin' acts
Chill lil' nigga before you pull a muscle flexin'
The kid gully, known to get money in all directions
A hustler, on the party scene for new customers
Do it big this summer, slid Charlie Sheen my number
(And that means)
More doe in the future, I'll touch
Cause your boy moves snow like a plow truck
Smoke weed up in blunts, I'm good with the glass pipes
Either way I stay high as fuck as the gas price

[Scratch Hook]:
"While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse"
"I exist even when no things are left"
"While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse"
"My thoughts are now universes"
"While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse"
"I exist even when no things are left"
"While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse"
"My thoughts are now universes"

[Verse Three] [Celph Titled]:
Yo, go out like Berkowitz, show you what I'm workin' with
Some bombs and some arms, now the conflict is gone
It's like I ate all of the beef
The money you make vs. me, the difference in an eight ball and a key
Bumpin' Eightball and MJG
But still I got this backpack rap down to a tee
Spit a couple flows and spit a couple lines and y'all pay me
Then I pay my therapist for tellin' me I'm crazy
Motherfuckin' murder entitled, the Tool Man Taylor
Taping a 'kick me' sign on the back of the bailiff
Strutin' in the court room like 2Pac
Armani suit, Bulgari shades, thermos full of that Goose
They say my music don't represent God's vision
They say it's blasphemous but it don't matter, I'm not religious
Stealin' glass from cathedrals, yeah I'm runnin' Windows
But I use a Mac when I'm gunnin' for your kinfolk
Blllaaaa

[Outro]:
The Demigodz. Half human, half deity. A hybrid. The offspring of the gods. The fallen angels
