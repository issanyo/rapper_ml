(Verse 1: Araknophobix)
You can now enter my invisible rhyme real world
How does it fell? Mortals tend to melt into the mix
Unconscious come with me, I’ll lead you to the core
Trap doorway to nowhere, you woke up with no hair
Completely singed off traveling at light speed, don’t go there
Prepare to feel the effects of the venom we inject through the neck
Way beyond what you’d expect, just wait a sec
Ahh, there it is again euphoric oblivion
Cranial stimulation exits from eyeballs, this padded room has eye walls
Atom crushing fly balls, it’s my fault

(Verse 2: Celph Titled)
Yo, the God body divine mathematically
Wave my staff at the faculty
I see visual hallucinations with acute accuracy
Lock down communication through the mouth like slave days
My rules canal from dungeons into synagogue limit cave ways
Do not block with your eyes will not deceive you and put you in visions
Expose identities that I can see through as a warning
The photo phantasm, certificate notary
Counting sheep while they jump over me
While hanging by my rosary

(Verse 3: Raj)
We all went to sleep inside of a vortex
Many childs unhurting, anticipating the effects
In a few minutes, we have lived a whole lifetime
With our minds but we like living, feeling divine
Magic chemistry unlike you will ever be
The same by deep blue for the insane
Antenna methamorphisze resonate
Psychoactive specimen electron metabolic state
Antenna methamorphisze resonate
Psychoactive specimen electron metabolic state

(Verse 4: Dutchmassive)
Chrome eight legged arachnid shoots its webbing
Live disable enemies reach for my weapon
Get the fuck back, beyond paranoid
My fist is now attached to an alien android
Cyborgs attack me, I could see a spaceship
I’m wasted to the point where I’m ripping off my face
Lying, my body is numb and wondering
Life on acid, alcohol and overdoes on toxaphene

(Verse 5: Maleko)
Optical distort, teleport and stop abortions
Fiery Phoenix, morbid phantoms sorceress
Levitating through colorful clouds
Rotating counterclockwise, contorted
Deep in the chorus, sordid endorphin
Chariots of fire scorching
Dunes they sent those flying swordfish horsemen
North winds in the sky orchestrating
Painting the devil evil grin in his eye
To deadly cold and hideous shapes
Reaching up through a watery grave
Super regular figures appear to dwindle
Forensics leave paralysis
Floating palaces motionless sculpts in flights reunions
Every time I dream at night it gets so confusing
Silent words explaining, raining ominous comets
