[Hook: Block McCloud] (x2)
The doctor's telling me I may be mad
Maybe it's cause we living in this crazy land
I'm a crazy man, a crazy man
In a crazy land, a crazy land

[Verse 1: Block McCloud]
I feel disconnected, distant like heaven
Missed what the reverend said it's a bit upsettin'
Wishin' that I'd listened better cause yes, I'm sinnin'
Fuckin' a nun in her cunt while her head's spinnin'
Piss like a kid that's wetting his bed linen
I'm twisted on meds having sex with dead women
Lost in the sauce, my foster mom forced me to drink
As she peeled my foreskin back and sucked it off 'till it was pink
Thoughts that I think as I wash my balls in a sink
My balls up in my stomach that's why they call them a shrink
Like Cobain on cocaine
Feelin' no pain on Soul Train
With a gold chain 'bout to throw flames
Like propane and I won't play with a full deck
This whole game is jokers
Wild as I go insane in the membrane like Cypress
Or that white bitch that played Lois Lane
Margot Kidder, I'mma go get 'em
And hit her in the shitter I'm a psycho killer

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
I bring a hammer to a slow jam
Throw wrenches in your program
Nail gun through both hands
Screwdrivers in your throat, damn
Make you a known example
Throw roman candles, hone the poison arrows
Boy destroy a pair, I'll roast your flannel
Demonically possessed, doctors suggest I am a psycho
Chainsaw on my gun like a Gears of War rifle
Q-tip sex on a platter mask
Gripping a talking Cabbage Patch with C4 in the battery pack
Yeah I'm actually that, insane med pills
Visions of chasing enemies while I'm on my fucking treadmill
Merry Christmas, kiss the barrel under the mistletoe (Mwooah!)
Shot every part of your body bitch except I missed your toe
If it's a diss you'll know, scalpel to your torso carving slow
Rollin' out intestines like a garden hose (Or)
Make you swallow a 40 ounce
And see how many karate chops it takes
To punch your stomach 'till the bottle breaks

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: R.A. The Rugged Man]
I’m lamping, I’m cold lamping
I'm amped and I slice you up like Crystal Lake camping
Like Daddy Kane said it, "Stop Shammin'"
I'm boastin' I'm braggin' ravin' and rantin'
Leaving you deader than Bruce's son Brandon
And I sent you to the moon like Ralph Kramden
I'm the craziest of the crazies in history
Charles Manson's a pussy, he wanna be a musician, I piss on that hippie
I'm the reason the Zodiac's still missing
Fuck Jeffrey Dahmer was a bitch
He fucked boys and got murdered in prison
And David Berkowitz the Son of Sam
He talked to doggies
Gacy was a clown none of them fuckin' with Rugged Man
I'm demented, delusional, shock treatment, lunatic Critters
Cut out your livers with scissors
I'm splittin' the wig of you wiggers
Sho Kosugi, ninjas, Rambo, Sleepaway Camp slashers
Heather Thomas posters in my brain, the 80s never passed us
Central Park I'm stealing purses and I'm robbing the joggers
They wanna lock us, I’m raping the nurses and murdering the doctors
Come on

[Hook] (x2)

[Outro: Various scratches and samples]
(They made you believe)
(There's no one really crazy as me)
(I drove myself mad, searching for sanity)
(World's like a cell, God created just to hold me)
I'm crazy!
Crazy man!
Crazy!
Crazy!

[Hook] (x2)
