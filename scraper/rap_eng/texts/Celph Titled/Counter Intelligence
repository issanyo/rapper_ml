Uh, yeah, uh
Celph motherfuckin’ Titled
Yeah, haha
RZ Rhymeztein
Yeah, Demigodz

[Verse 1: Rhymeztein]
Yeah I’m a god on the mic
There is no discussion
Cause I’m ahead of my time
Like Benjamin Button
Makin’ records easy
We so ruthless
I wreak havoc
Like the toilet on my peeps tour bus
Yeah, I’m a vet G
So don’t tempt me
Come to my show
And see my fly flow
Like a jet stream
Some of my homies
Lost all they noodles
Searchin’ for you with the chrome
I ain’t talking ‘bout Google
Yeah these bitches love it
So they can all suck it
I’m so dope
Even China told me I can spit in public
Y’all some bloody stuck-up pussies
Like tampons
And you ain’t really blowin’ up kid
You just a flash bomb
Ain’t talkin’ bout a redneck party
But I got this ho down
Suckin’ on my dick
While I play records by Motown
I got the [?] the crowd applause
And I don’t gotta aim my finger at a staple
To get my point across
Above the drama, oh I’m on that level
Spittin’ bars, with more advantage than a gas pedal
Oh gee, the name is RZ
I be victorious
It’s no big deal like being born before Notorious

Counter intelligence
My broken mind demise a lead to spit it broken inside
Counter intelligence
Watching your back, it be a must

[Verse 2: Celph titled]
Boom box radio, bitch
I break these microphones down to chemical compounds
No I ain’t a graff writer but yet instil bitch I will bomb towns
My lyrics, that’s just some shit straight out of gods mouth
The 5th [?], well maybe the Glock’s out
Godzilla, no gorilla
Bang back I aimin’ for realla
You got a face tat but that don’t make you a killah (no)
I’m makin’ Canadian bread in big portions (gimme that)
Like I own ten thousand franchises of Tim Hortons (uh)
Demigodz been extorting (who?)
Rappers is dumb retarded
Wearing female under-garments
Vegetarians on stake-outs
They fake, I make ‘em another target (bam!)
Smack ya captain hat to the side
Make you capsize
I’m the bad guy
That switch your comforter with cacti (you heard?)
So you might feel a spike in crime
When my rifle find
School are fishing tuition
We ain’t biting lines (no way)
And y’all just out of your element (what you mean?)
I strategize my war plans on the kitchen table
That’s counter intelligence

Yeah, Rhymeztein
My broken mind demise a lead to spit it broken inside
Uh, Celph motherfuckin’ Titled
Watching your back, it be a must
