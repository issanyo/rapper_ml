[Talking Hook Adlibs]
Yeah, Celph muthafuckin' Titled
The God damn 'Hardcore Data'
Muthafucka...

[Verse One]
The microphone mutilator, I'll bruise ya crews and neighbors
Do you dudes a favor, show you how to use a razor
(Are you a buddha blazer?) Yes I get zooted major
And all you stupid haters, hit you with computer lasers
I got the smoothest flava, makin' moves, movin' makers
Off the roof, who's to save ya? (Who's the savior?)
Celph Titled the Rubix Ranger (playa), scoopin' paper, when I'm doin' capers
And what's inside this bazooka case'll shoot a crater
In ya screwface and dufus gayfers
My ruthless anger got animal in the zoo behavior
The Uz'll spray ya, lose ya body in a lake or
Tombs and chambers where you'll consume fumes and vapors
(Huh-Hah) we mash fucks like soup 'n potatoes
It's true we'll do fools in, bury them with the rutabagas
Sooner or later, fine-tuned parachutin' invaders'll
Tear thru ya Winnebaga, wearin' suits and aimin' aero-fusion phasers
Ain't talkin' mules and acres
I'm filmin' movies in Bermuda on a cruise to Jamaica
I'm a front tooth eraser, you's a booty shaker
And you'll be found in a pool with baracudas and gators

Yeah, you know what the fuck it is
Still on top, man
It's the muthafuckin' Grand Daddy Grenade Man
Y'all know me, man
Fuck y'all!
Check it, yeah

[Verse Two]
I'm too real, ill, still will kill
No frills, no gold grills, hold still, hooker-ho, chill
I know you smoke krills, you shouldn't go 'til
I throw you out the mobile (in Mobile)
Alabama in a pile of ants in pajamas
Surrounded by a thousand salamanders
I'mma bust a round of cannons off, camoflauged as a Satanic Santa Claus
Ain't another man that's raw, you should turn your cameras on
Cause I'm bringin' the blammmer sauce, the blicker oil
The trigger boilin' hot from firin' shots, I'll spit it for you
I promise you that, ask momma who's back
The muthafuckin' Montezuma of rap hollerin' BRRAATT!
And that's the way it goes down, you fraudulent foe clown
I'mma put ya skull in the dryer and watch it go 'round
("Oh my God!") I'm salutin' one for y'all
No more shootin' guns at all, I'm boostin' the sun from God

Bitch ass muthafuckas
You thought I was gonna stop doin' this or fall off?
Yo, y'all get back, man
Everybody get back, man
Hold up man, this is Celph muthafuckin'...

[Verse Three]
So when I walk in the club with black jeans and a white tee
You're on a walky-talky callin' security: "Hurry please!"
It's Celph and he came strapped, bringin' so much pain that
You can't get enough (Novacaine packs)
So insane in fact, I was held captive
By unattractive cave women overdosed on Proactiv
("Yo this that shit!") from the dynamite stick expert
With bottle rockets, I flirt with hotter objects of sex
And they flex in my bedroom
Legs spread thick, redhead bitch, BOOM, with no freckles
She was actually half black / Icelandic
I might land in Spanish, Italian, French
Or whatever the fuck airport they got
At my mansion the size of a Marriot, yes my rhymes are very hot
Wear a vest cause when my CDs are pressed
They fly like Japanese ninja stars and they'll injure y'all
