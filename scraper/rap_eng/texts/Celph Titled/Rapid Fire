[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
(Yea!) I'm bringing weapons to sessions
Mongolian swords that open up pores
And slice you into Delicatessen
I'm one hell of a reverend
Cause when they want answers from God
I tell 'em it's an irrelevant question (stop stressing)
All you transvestites wear your vest tight
Catch you at a red light we aiming for your head lice
So let me make a blanket statement
I'm 'a strangle you with a bed sheet until your lungs cave in
Coughin' up blood from a puncture wound
So don't assume you won't be under tombs
Dumb baffoon that's coming soon
(We got) NASA blueprints for lasers you heard me?
We're doing lasic surgery on the faces of herb MCs
Running dangerous experiments
We're trying to develop explosive chewing gum
Making C-4 out of spearmint
D-G-Z A-O-T-P Dwella's corrosiveness
Chilling in a room with mailbombs about to open shit

[Hook]
Rapid fire heads are flyin'
Straightin' out the bullshit when we press the iron
Million dollar mouthpiece spit flows and it goes

[Verse 2: Phantasm]

Cella Dwellas back up in the biz
You know exactly what it is
It's grown man shit we ain't rappin' for the kids
Scraping and scrounging ,scraping just to live
I'm trying to >get it's all my all???< I got to give
They say time is money so no time to play
I'm on my grind for money trying to find a way
Big homie status nigga 'til my dying day
Alotta of my big homies they >?????<
Like the battlefield niggas be acting ill
Instead of packing steel I sit back and chill
I'm trying to stock a mill and make money off the music
Nowadays these emcees only abuse it
>?????< they won't let you chose it
That Role Model title careful how to use it
It's in the blood dog we won't ever lose it
That underground never confuse it
I'm done

[Hook]

[Verse 3:UG]

(Yeah)Here's a grave,look punked werewolf
Lines and hooks rhymes and books
That make sense it make sense 'cos it
Make sense for me and that turn to dollars
I got to demolish anything I hop on flows
You're not ready
