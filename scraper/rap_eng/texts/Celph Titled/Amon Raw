[Verse 1: Apathy]
Yo I don't care if you a thug or not, you ever fought a juggernaut?
Thoughts travel faster than the speed that a slug is shot
And fuck a one-on-one, bring on four of y'all
I'll cripple and torture you like a Klingon warrior
Or a Romulan and rob you with the mask of a Hobgoblin
Boggling brains out in the Range with the gas throttlin'
Your bitch' pussy throbbin', dome bobbin', no oxygen
I'm bottlin' blood of a model, and sip it like Scottish Gin
You bitches always in clubs, I can't feel you
I hate clubs more than baby seals do
Your man raps, he's an amateur rockin'
And stays pushing a bucket, like a janitor moppin'
I got a toxic gas canister poppin' and fans hoppin'
Out the windows at shows, like death is the only option
Y'all don't want it so quietly observe this
Comic book nerd who got a loaded Mossberg

[Hook: Apathy]
When I stepped on stage they stood still
The Sun God, Amun Ra, no chill
The dopest rhymes you ever heard in your life
So if you ever see me drop the mic, tell your boy
To pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
Tell your boy to pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
Yo, you better pay me or it's payback so don't tempt me
When it's gun talk I speak eloquently
This guided missile, split in half your flimsy chopper
Celph without semi's pop is like Russians without plenty vodka
Kinda like going to Wendy's for a Whopper
Or The Goonies without Cyndi Lauper
One shot will lop a ear off, yes I'm a murder vet
You tried to choke me but it only felt like a turtle neck
East Coast Bloods banging a five star, Crips banging a six
Demigodz bangin' a whip, hang glidin' from cliffs
It's like my clique works at the gardenin' center
They bag up every rock and set up shop and got the heart for the winter
We on the top and that's the best of all
I must be lookin' through binoculars backwards, y'all look hella small
My subject matter never broadens, just gats that splatter organs
But they love my verses so much, they fast-forward the chorus

[Hook: Apathy]
When I stepped on stage they stood still
The Sun God, Amun Ra, no chill
The dopest rhymes you ever heard in your life
So if you ever see me drop the mic, tell your boy
To pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
Tell your boy to pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up

[Verse 3: Pumpkinhead]
I'm the epitome of underground, I spit maggots and worms
I'm a heat wave, so your ass getting burned
And if I ever get burned, watch my ashes return
To flesh and bone, then I jump my ass out the urn
Grab the microphone from you and start to rap out of turn
And when your crew start to get amped I make 'em relax like a perm
I'm fast with my hands, sorta like Hagler and Hearns
I beat that ass so fast I reverse that ass back to sperm
Niggas be tryin' to cruise with me, but get tossed of the boat
I give them a Tracheotomy so they have to talk through their throat
I make crouching tigers stand up and find hidden dragons
Walk on air like Chow Yun-fat and speak in different patterns
To civilize the savage that helped my people grow
Like sperm and embryos, you got an empty flow
I burn rappers faster than Michael Jackson's hair
After the Pepsi commercial without rehearsal, yo

[Hook: Apathy]
When I stepped on stage they stood still
The Sun God, Amun Ra, no chill
The dopest rhymes you ever heard in your life
So if you ever see me drop the mic, tell your boy
To pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
Tell your boy to pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up

[Outro: Apathy]
Rest in peace to my brother P.H., Pumpkinhead
That was my homie for 20 years
Nuyorican cafe, cyphers and shit, '88 hip hop
We came up at the same time
One of the best dudes I ever met in my life
Yeah, peace brother
