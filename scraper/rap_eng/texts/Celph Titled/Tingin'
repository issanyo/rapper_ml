[Intro:]
[Man:]
What's gonna have to happen to change things?
[Woman:]
Huh. A hole lot gonna have to happen to change things
A lot of motherfuckin' heads gonna start to pop off

[Hook: Scratch]
[Big Shug 'Crush':]
"Swingin', drama that I'm bringin'
On your left jaw I be tingin'
Swingin', drama that I'm bringin'
On your left jaw I be tingin'
Swingin', drama that I'm bringin'
On your left jaw I be tingin'
There's no way you can win
I'm wipin' off silly grins
When I come to kick your face in"

[Verse 1:]
This ain't Rock Of Love but I'll rock a thug
Make you wear a rag and a wig like Brett Michaels does
The tec rifle is bug (yeah)
Sometimes it jams but most of the time it spits projectiles at your mug
I'm from a city known for rollin' cigars
Hoppin' fences in historic districts, evadin' patrol cars
And so far I go hard
I can spit four bars that's whip you across the face like chrome reinforced crowbars
In '96 I rocked with nine 6's
That's triple six, three times so imagine the evil in that (wow)
Dressed like Count Dracula beatin' you feeble people with bats
I like Britney Spears fat (yeah)
I'm puttin' poisonous gas in your motherfuckin' beer can hat
Your body found live on National Geographic where the Meerkats at
The white Latin with them weird ass raps
You better pay me right now cause
[Mobb Deep 'Hell On Earth':] "I'm tryin' to make cream and that's that"

[Hook: Scratch]
[Big Shug 'Crush':]
"Swingin', drama that I'm bringin'
On your left jaw I be tingin'
Swingin', drama that I'm bringin'
On your left jaw I be tingin'
Swingin', drama that I'm bringin'
On your left jaw I be tingin'
There's no way you can win
I'm wipin' off silly grins
When I come to kick your face in"

[Verse 2:]
Held this position in your bathroom, found you dead
(How'd you die?)
I put cyanide in your bathroom shower head
Critics who get the nerve;
They better hide they bitch and ho
Cause I'll put a bullet in your bird if you pigeonhole
In case you didn't know
I've got the illest flow
My style's double D all natural, yours is silicone
The punchline master
Never get lazy with my writing cause I am gettin' paid when I'm rhyming
You get slayed when you're rhyming
At a battle for free
If I'm moving my Adam's Apple it costs a fee (ya heard)
So pull your cannons and try these boys
And I'm sending lead back like it's some Chinese toys
Business mogul on my business phone
With an overgrown vocal tone known to leave you blown out of your mobile home (whoa)
And on your left jaw I'm tingin'
Drama that I'm bringin'
Don't work for the church but I be bell ringin'

[Hook: Scratch]
[Big Shug 'Crush':]
"Swingin', drama that I'm bringin'
On your left jaw I be tingin'
Swingin', drama that I'm bringin'
On your left jaw I be tingin'
Swingin', drama that I'm bringin'
On your left jaw I be tingin'
There's no way you can win
I'm wipin' off silly grins
When I come to kick your face in"

[Verse 3:]
(You can call me Steven Tyler)
I'm one of the best arrow smiths
Expert with archery and all types of weapon shit
In my rap category, I stand alone
You stand alone without a date watchin' Home Alone
I put the Maaulay Culkin
Facial expression on the face of a bitch testin'
Bitch you see this Smith & Wesson? (see it?)
Remember Smif-N-Wessun? Now they the Cocoa Brovaz
Remember Celph Titled? Now he's a loco fucker
I'm dope because I chose a rubber when I fucked hip hop
And now that bitch can't burn me, so I rip shop
Better adapt to my philosophy soon
Or you gonna be that skeleton in that Biology room
I dare a beat maker to take it to war (with me)
Turn you to a ghost producer like a Dr. Dre (employee)
For sure you get fucked and felt
If you went gay bashin', you'd have to punch yourself

[Hook: Scratch]
[Big Shug 'Crush':]
"Swingin', drama that I'm bringin'
On your left jaw I be tingin'"
