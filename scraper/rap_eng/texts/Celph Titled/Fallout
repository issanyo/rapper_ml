(Chorus: Dutchmassive)
Don’t ever push yourself against’ the wall
Cause everybody at a time knows it gets raw
And if you step, we’re going to shatter your jaw
(Cause if your fucking with one kid, yo, you’re fucking with ‘em all)

(Verse 1: Celph Titled)
(Yo, who the fuck are you?)

Don Juan steeze be razor splitting you
Rubix Cuban unsolvable, the high tech arsenals
Shiny metal things spit something horrible
Vocal arrangements inaudible
Pistol whip you
Mandatory, not option, what you stupid?
My clique consists of dirty dogs, and Cuban mafia children
Plastic explosive play dough the money is mine if I say so
Ain’t no thing in this universe that could ever be my match
Celph Titled without fly raps is like Slick Rick without an eye patch
Now how you like that?
Yup, my recipes dope I’m used to the game like Jeopardy under the oath
And lethal like white boys in trench coats
Straight up and down I’m serving niggas with 16 bar sentences
My spoken word is contagious and cancerous
I cancel kids like answering messages left by solicitation receptionists
Like my man Dutchmassive, we aggressively repping shit
(Ain’t no question kid)
Lurking in the everglades
While you at home watching cartoons
I’ll be sitting on the dock of the bay, with a harpoon

(Chorus: Dutchmassive)
Don’t ever push yourself against’ the wall
Cause everybody at a time knows it gets raw
And if you step, we’re going to shatter your jaw
(Cause if your fucking with one kid, yo, you’re fucking with ‘em all)

Don’t ever push yourself against’ the wall
Cause everybody at a time knows it gets raw
And if you step, we’re going to shatter your jaw
(Cause if your fucking with one kid, yo, you’re fucking with ‘em all)

(Verse 2: Walkman)
And pissed off the wrong one
Hand break my pencil piece when I write this
A head storm shatter skulls
Speaking of blood sport, splatter over all pearly white
Fresh contest blazing adrenaline behaving rude and absurd
While the out of states criticize from the outside viewing
In observing and stressing us, the tropics
Fuck all you corn hole fuckers with no logic
Brining the heat, scorching your bare feet
Sprinting butt naked, long distance
Decking moving objects, direct shots but beaming optics
And that’s the instincts of a natural at time
If you ain’t heard right, I split bricks, strictly certified blaze shit

Light speed I’m sonically inclined with godly insight
Niggas get blow to bits like megabytes
Can’t fuck with this, alright
Storm dash trooper, the cybernetic intelligence
The 5th element regiment, crush your residence into sediments
Encrypted flows with the centrifugal dialect
The Puerto Rican cybernetic one
Authentic while you synthetic son
I hold down the galaxy with unanimous connections
Quantum physics expert ripping holes right through your guess shirt
The seven squadron dynasty get down and dirty violently
Walkmen and freestyles with the emcee seeking missles
Atomically stay blazing accurately bout to black out of this
Is Tampa’s side of things and that’s what 8-1-3’s about

(Chorus: Dutchmassive)
Don’t ever push yourself against’ the wall
Cause everybody at a time knows it gets raw
And if you step, we’re going to shatter your jaw
(Cause if your fucking with one kid, yo, you’re fucking with ‘em all)

Don’t ever push yourself against’ the wall
Cause everybody at a time knows it gets raw
And if you step, we’re going to shatter your jaw
(Cause if your fucking with one kid, yo, you’re fucking with ‘em all)

(Verse 3: Dutchmassive)
Yo, I sense anger, how you going to diss a total stranger
Talk about my records, I’m a have to rearrange you
Feel this laser, you’re not who you pretend to be
Knock off your identity and aim for longevity
Fuck your concepts, I can do without your comments
The liveliest player on a catcher burning comet
You make me vomit, sick of all your trends
If I break all keyboards before tracks the wackness ends
Constantly stay blazing, F-L-A is dumb hot
No Glocks baby boy, I’ll smash your jaw with a cinder block
Hard knock not, I’m just a little anti-social
We word wide, while y’all still think we local
My name is Dutchmassive, remember that shit
I’m killing kids, girls that diss me, get the di-dick
Only got a few close friends and that’s way too much
Cause soon they all jock us when we blow the fuck up
