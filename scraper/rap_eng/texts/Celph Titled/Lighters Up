[Intro: Truth Enola talking]
I remember I used to go to shows and they used to have they lighters up right. I don't know what that meant to them but to me it meant life

[Hook: Truth Enola]
Put your lighters up up up, in the air air
Put your lighters up up up, in the air air
And this means fo' life life life, have no fear fear
Put your lighters up up up, in the air air
Put your lighters...

[Verse One: Truth Enola]
This flame, is lit for my uncle
Who died in the struggle, lost his life in the jungle
Fought in the Vietnam War was it good?
Only to come back and lose the war in the hood
Hell nah it ain't good
Grand ma ma
So sorry, thought I had a chance grandma
Hold the fam, I'm trying to handle it ma
Trouble on my mind, come and dance with me ma
Hadn't talked to yo brah
Must maintain
Wash away the rain, that black hole rain
Hold up the flame for the love and the pain
For the fam and the families lost to this game

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Dragon (Mad Men Moss)
See this flame? Is for daughter that's gone
Fought for her life but she died in my arms
Weather the storm make me wanna go and bare arms
And cause harm; because I just couldn't cope
Lost my hope
Drag's at the end of his rope
Somehow my babies kept me afloat
Telling me, "Daddy go ahead and shed them tears."
Ain't enough that we living in fear, bombs falling from the air
It's so severe, yo throw your flames in the air
When the smoke clear, yo the Moss will still be here
Lend me your ears so you can hear me loud and clear
Mentally bug, unconditional love
I live my whole life as a thug with a pretty boy mug
Ducking these slugs
This nigga been marked for death
Hold ya breath
This is how the fuck it's going down
Throw 'em up now now now now

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Truth Enola]
This flame, flame was lit for my family
Fighting in the struggle and the ones who understand me
Break chains, chains you can't clamp me
Fuck with my mind from the shit that you hand me
This flame; is lit for my baby
Girl in a world I know shit looking crazy
Daddy always fighting, mama always drunk and lazy
Daddy only fighting so you can become a lady
This flame; is lit for my niggero
Shit gon' pick up, until then hit 'em low
Monstrous
Monstrous
Feel my light y'all

[Hook]
