[Intro: Celph Titled]
Yeah, fuck taking hip hop back
We moving shit forward
East Coast Avengers
Celph Titled the captain of decapitation
One two, one two
Trademarc mic check
Esoteric mic check
DC beat check
Demigodz, AOTP
We slice necks, let's go

[Verse 1: Trademarc]
We’re young, bored, not dumb, self-absorbed
Numb, heroes unsung
Now I’ve been holding my tongue (why?)
Cause our slang sound dumb when you’re over 31
You’re overdone, overhyped, overpaid
Overnight stars can’t write two bars without an oversight
Fronting like an overbite, it’s only right (what?)
There’s been a lot of lonely nights
Where I struggle and fight well I cope
Is like juggling knifes on tightropes at a frightening height
Wrists sliced open both, writing suicide notes
With knots in your throat like boxes of votes (what’s wrong?)
I’ve seen enough doctors in cloaks
It’s unimpressive, I’m clinical
Manic depressive, cynical
Mood swings move like rings
Cyclical, panic obsessive, I can be aggressive
It’s typical to find me ripping you, it’s overly excessive
Everything I spit at you, admit it you openly try to ridicule
But you could never swallow everything you bit into
Straight out, more or less you gone fade out
Laid out before like you like your shadow when the shade out
Don’t make me pull the one plus eight out

[Hook]
Are you listening?
If I got to choose a coast I got to choose the east
East Coast boom bap, pm to the am
The revolution is near, are you listening?
It ain’t hard to tell I’m the East Coast Overdose
If I got to choose a coast I got to choose the east
East Coast, Avengers, pm to the am
Some say the revolution is near, are you listening?
East Coast boom bap, all day

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
I let a wild bull loose on the White House lawn
Twenty minutes later I have the President on the horn (word is bond)
And that’s real talk
With phony silence, one look in my rhyme book, homie, and it’s only violence
At the telly in a bathrobe with loaded chrome
Vacation in Boca Raton, left you with broken bones
If you provoke then it's on, that means we get it popping
Cop a thousand bricks from a thousand cops at a government auction
We rap regurgitators, repeat my verse, my fans say shit cause my words contagious
In hindsight, I guess I rhyme like no other MC can rhyme like
Think you better then I’m like: “Yeah right.”
Cause ain’t nobody that sounds like this
I’m a motherfucking rap perfectionist
So all the other MCs that came before me
Gotta realise that I'm the future, you will adorn me
And did I mention that, I’m pitching crack?
Underhand with rubber bands and my East Coast Avengers mask
Begin my wrath in a Samurai sword stance
Thought you went to Heaven but got denied by the doorman

[Hook]
Are you listening?
If I got to choose a coast I got to choose the east
East Coast boom bap, pm to the am
The revolution is near, are you listening?
It ain’t hard to tell I’m the East Coast Overdose
If I got to choose a coast I got to choose the east
East Coast, Avengers, pm to the am
Some say the revolution is near, are you listening?
East Coast boom bap, all day

[Verse 3: Esoteric]
After PE but before Flavor of Love
After Jay-Z but before he got played in clubs
There was an MC spitting that wasn’t afraid of blood
That wasn’t afraid of struggle, that wasn’t afraid to muscle
His way in the game with hustle like Russel and have a cheque
We power forward, you were gone, just a passing threat
Plus that hood you grew up in, that’s the top of a bassinet
You’re more mental than ghetto son of Geppetto
I’m a rebel yelling devil, I'ma level your empire
Y’all fail again, we got the Midi Alien
East Coast Avengers dawg, I ain’t in blood
Lie in the mud, run for cover
Thought they fly in the SCUD’s
You can’t handle bare facts with the mind of a cup
These thugs wanna go out with a bang but die with a sigh and a thud
Tell me what’s cool with that, tell me what’s hood with that
Tell me you’re pushing a pen dawg and I’ll push your crack

[Hook]
If I got to choose a coast I got to choose the east
East Coast boom bap, boom bap
The revolution is near, are you listening?
It ain’t hard to tell I’m the East Coast Overdose
If I got to choose a coast I got to choose the east
East Coast boom bap, East Coast Overdose
The revolution is near, are you listening?
East Coast boom bap, all day
East Coast boom bap, East Coast Overdose
East Coast
Boom Bap

[Outro: Esoteric]
My man Statik Selektah with that ziggah ziggah, good looks
DC with the, uh, you know what he brings to the table
