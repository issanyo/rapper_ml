Only two places (uh) I ain't been befo'
Inside of a UFO and in love with a ho
Last year I took a bitch on a date and I was treatin
Then I seen Hailey's Comet pass by when we was eatin
Meanin if you want me, to buy yo' beers
Ya lil' bitch, you gonna wait another ninety-six years
Then I'll be full of Viagra, beat yo' ass with my cane
Drinkin Geritol and gin and gettin head on the train
The Hogs in the house (uh) Cuban and the Captain
Don't touch my chinchilla, get my scrilla
Celph made this beat (uh) on stereo mode
Nigga you thought a 808 was an area code?
Ve-hog-ular homicide hoes, straight from out of my Vogues
Give a ho a clothesline if she ask me for clothes
Not a thug, in my trunk I don't have no clip
Just a basketball, a jack, and a loudmouth... bitch!

[Hook]

[Scratches - repeat 5X]
"Pigs are filthy animals" "That's right lil' bitch!"
