(Verse 1: Apathy)
Shhh! Y’all gotta believe me when I say that earth girls are easy
Skirts fly off as soon as they hear the CD
Not that they hoes, but the flow is so dope
Whether rap or the mattress, Ap’s no joke
In a bar where the college girls shake they ass
Midnight, arrive fashionably late for class
Wondering how many lectures it takes to smash
But remember, only grade A can pass
Get her back to the dorm, she’s a freak, likes porn
Hard to the core, that’ll get her soft and warm
As soon as we start freaking, the bed start squeaking
She stops like, shhh! My roommate’s sleeping
We ain’t about to quit, baby doll wants more
So we switch up the style, throw a blanket on the floor
Blow her back out, ass drops, raise it up
Hold up, shh! I think your roommate’s waking up

(Chorus: Apathy)
Shhh! Don’t make so much noise
Shhh! Lower your pants, lower your voice
Shhh! I’m trying to keep it discreet
So we could kiss Shhh! Lick Shhh! What Shhh! Freak

Shhh! Don’t make so much noise
Shhh! Lower your pants, lower your voice
Shhh! I’m trying to keep it discreet
So we could kiss Shhh! Lick Shhh! What Shhh! Freak

(Verse 2: Celph Titled)
Shhh! Listen, you got me all wrong
Thinking I get off onto some old regular shit
With any regular bitch, I want to skeet in your nose
Mommy, my fetishes are sick, I like an amazon broad
With F cup size titties
That scream loud when my stockings up in her chimney
But back at the crib, this ho got nine kids
And every sound we making have them opening they little eye lids
Can you imagine the trauma from them seeing they momma
Spread eagle with a leather coat, dressed like Madonna
In the kiddie pool filled with jello pudding snacks
Licking on my dick and shouting out where to put it at
(We can’t have that)
So I’m a duct tape your grill shut cause we’ll fuck
Crazy, rough and rugged, you little milf slut
We woke your daughter up, but no need for the tears
Cause she’ll be doing the same thing with me in ten years

(Chorus: Celph Title)
Shhh! Don’t make so much noise
Shhh! Lower your pants, lower your voice
Shhh! I’m trying to keep it discreet
So we could kiss Shhh! Lick Shhh! What Shhh! Freak

Shhh! Don’t make so much noise
Shhh! Lower your pants, lower your voice
Shhh! I’m trying to keep it discreet
So we could kiss Shhh! Lick Shhh! What Shhh! Freak

(Verse 3: Apathy)
I hit it so hard you think your skeletal could fracture
Ladies label Ap most eligible bachelor
She’s holding her mouth when I’m going down south
To muffled all moans and groans is coming out
I put my back into it when I’m burying you
You barely can move cause other dudes rarely this smooth
I might bust but I’m not necessarily though
So I tell you shhh! Like librarians do, slightly tipsy
Liquor got her mood real kinky
You better act right, make sure there’s no hickies
As for anything that’s sexual, I’m incredible
I know it’s hard to hold down, but tone down your decibels
Shhh! I fucked Billy Jean, make the sheets glow
These hoes love it when I whip it like Deebo
Even up inside the club with my boys around
I like my privacy so keep the noises down

(Chorus: Apahty)
Shhh! Don’t make so much noise
Shhh! Lower your pants, lower your voice
Shhh! I’m trying to keep it discreet
So we could kiss Shhh! Lick Shhh! What Shhh! Freak

(Chorus: Celph Titled)
Shhh! Don’t make so much noise
Shhh! Lower your pants, lower your voice
Shhh! I’m trying to keep it discreet
So we could kiss Shhh! Lick Shhh! What Shhh! Freak
