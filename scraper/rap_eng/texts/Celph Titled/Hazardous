Yeah, What
Vitiate, C.Titled
Hazardous, 0'12 Shit
Fuck shit, Fuck bitch
Yeah!

[Verse 1:Celph Titled]
Intoxicated boxer you could call me punch drunk
And you gon' get beat down like some punks
That tried to jump up I lift the pump up and pump slugs
Stickin' my tongue out like a Michael Jordan dunk was
King Kong on top of buildings smackin' a chopper down
While he's spitting out chopper rounds (ain't stopping now)
Ain't stoppin' now no innovator of mind control devices
So my followers initiate the next historic crisis
My rhyme flow is priceless you say you got tricks up
Your sleeves but it's just your bitches biceps
In that white dress your girl's assets
Oh so stickin' out she a Bull Mastiff
Put a bone in her mouth in other words Celph Titled's
Renowned as the best sharp shooter and harpooner
That's out now so work it out at the gym or make threats
At this man and guarantee that sweatband will get wet fam

[Hook]
Damage it we're hazardous ain't nobody bad as us
Accidents contaminants and pacifists are mad as fuck
Sacrilege commandin' shit and now they've had enough
Faggot shit demands digust knockin' back who's
Standin' tough
