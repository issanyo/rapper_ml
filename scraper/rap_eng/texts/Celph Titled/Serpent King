[Verse 1: Blacastan]
Prolifical writers; I write with the mind of a lifer
On the block with his seed, stashing coke in his diapers
I'm MacGyver: I can make a pen out of a lighter
Pharaoh clique: there's no crew strong enough to fight us
I'm tryn'a live long enough to catch arthritis
On a rocking chair, talking 'bout the wonderful years
How we dominated this sport and ended careers
Departing your frame like Shaka Zulu wilding with spears
I'm a general with spikes on my military gear
Bodies is caught but I don't do tattoo tears
I've been deening for years, look at the length of the beard
Confirming your fears, the Army of the Pharaohs is here

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
Snipe the Celph Titled mascot
You still can't assassinate my character
So go ahead, I'll eradicate your exterior
With a furious anger
Teflon bed-sheets be my security blanket
If I'm off my rocker, then I might launch a rocket (in ya)
Mama said I'm tall but I got a short temper
Outrun a hyena and take home a cougar
Not the bat cave, the Depot where there's Chrome computers
And the gun is in the drawer
Would have fucked your bitch raw
But the bitch had a fungus in her drawers
So 'Don't Worry Be Happy', on some Bobby McFaggot shit
I got a ratchet chick that stay reloading my ratchet clips

[Verse 3: Crypt, the Warchild]
.44 magnum flow spitters; volcanic
Body shots rock your block on a cold canvas
Platinum bars, I achieved a gold standard
Adamantium frame, I'mma have to soul-snatch it
Nine-inch nails plunged in my bloody hands
I walk on water, kick through the grains of sand
Sniff clouds, take sips of the acid water
Throw lightning bolts, I ain't talking Harry Potter
Leave your limbs exposed, I ain't talking Gary Carter
Sick thoughts in my head, then I family harbor
So let me get this moment of clarity
I am out for paper, no time for charity

[Verse 4: Planetary]
Same shit: catching bodies on the regular, pa
No mercy; you can't hurt me. I'm deading you, dawg
I'm a different level devilish type
Heavy metal settle right into the ghetto at night
Break bone marrow, bow and arrows, clone pharaohs, we so sharp
Boast battles we throw shrapnel in yo' castle
You can bring it we just products of that Olde English
Fire extinguisher rap, now watch your flames diminish
I get spinach till the day I finish
There's no limits to the lyrics man, I just replenish
I'm a menace in the way I'm like a five-percenter
Cause 95% of y'all niggas is popping never

[Verse 5: Zilla]
I've been locked in the basement windows blacked out
Feel like Black Hawk Down with the enemy around
Ain't no harder than patience; every little move's like a
Hair trigger, waiting for the bullets to surround me
'The Devil made him do it'
I can hear my family on that bullshit
Saying I was lost to the darkness
Used to keep me fluid, but lately I've been tired of the L
So I started making all of yous a target
I'm strapped for the Rapture
Nothing in this world means
Nothing when it spins to the sound of the barrel
Now my Jacqueline Onassis 'Camelot' living
Was a dream till the King realized he was a pharaoh
I'm here to remind y'all
I'mma keep it raw
Till the day I get boxed in the dirt with the worms
I've already been lied to
"Stick to the script" is what I tell 'em
Right before I make the whole world burn
