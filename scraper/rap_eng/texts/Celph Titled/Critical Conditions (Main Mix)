(Intro: Celph Titled)

Yeah, the fate is in our hands
Equilibrium, Boogiemonsters, 1998

(Verse 1: Celph Titled)
Haunted by the opticals, exhibiting the man within myself
Parallel vision with no mirror in my possession
Seek help in this digression, consciously aware
A piece of human kind specifically designed for serving Jehovah
The hope for peace is over
The future correlates to actions executing themselves
Presently to the third degree
To the maximum, the year 1 comma 9-9-8
Nuclear buttons are controlling my fate
Hallucinate myself behind bars, there’s nothing I can do
Watch my brother self-destruct, affected with eternal flu
Technology advances advanced into potential danger
Government officials soon seek employment at the 18th hanger
Question the theory that one person makes a change
Stand up for your beliefs or all perceptions stay the same
From now until then, most people play the back seat
In this atmospherical taxi without paying fee
The problems persistent, misguided by the plush existence
Look at my hands, I realize just exactly who I am
Cause it was always here, when will it ever go away
The answer to that question comes with judgment day

(Chorus: Celph Titled)
If our lives were a novel, this could be the last edition
Realize what you do and start to make the right decision
If you’re seeking trouble, time to change your position
Our generation can’t survive in critical conditions

(Verse 2: Vex)
My voice travels miles from the middle east of Florida
Toward the vital information through your corridor
The New World Order the ill plot to lock blocks
Watch the poor on they monitors resort to selling rocks
Society’s the pyramid on the back of the dollar
Minorities the bottom rung, the middle rung is the scholars
Moving up in the degrees in masonic fraternities
Like the order Louis representing the beast
Infantries infiltrating they every wicked move
With recognizant tactics that be locking the groove
A record, so you can check it, respect it and know the truth
Babylon’s a war, I fight this war with proof
For black youth who ain’t free but just emancipated
Like fifty percent of brothers in DC incarcerated
Still, we can be faded, that’s what America’s so jaded
Change the whole frame of the game and how they played it
But we get assassinated by press like OJ
But when Clinton page whores and wage wars, it’s ok
I break these lines of defense like sports and take no shorts
When I’m out in the streets or approaching the bench in circuit courts
My battles are fought, the narrow path is sought
Yo, my soldiers bring the wrath of God and can’t be bought
If you brought the KKK and the pope, you couldn’t enslave the voice
That collapsed the matron to an enclave
I dropped a jewel and save a pearl from the swine
Corrupt they minds, keeping this jam shining in the nines
Powerless cause power refines, you gained spine catch a house arrest anklet
Tracked by GPS, information and location beamed to satellites
You thought you could dead it yo, but you can’t battle right, take my advice
Or wise up on your mission, hot metal can’t change the ghetto’s critical condition

(Chorus)
If our lives were a novel, this could be the last edition
Realize what you do and start to make the right decision
If you’re seeking trouble, time to change your position
Our generation can’t survive in critical conditions

(Verse 3: Dutchmassive)
The organic cyborg deport from a tape deck
Dastardly fall off glass mirror with no concept
Ironic, I was created from Chernobyl’s project
Outcast into the shadows, a city without logic
Peeking out sewer drains, I learned from society
So half humanoids is mutant plus they rioting
Vital information journalists remain silent
Saturday morning cartoons consist of sins and acts of violence
Now I’m violent, bringing up violent attack mode
I have cloned human vortex to avoid a barcode
Conditions for the future are decided through the present
Indefinite, through genetics, I was raised to be intrepid
Forget utopia, junk planet is my reality
I used to dream about life as a peaceful art gallery
Top secret ways of living, citizens controlled by hard drive
Lives covered by government to androids with snake eyes

(Chorus)
If our lives were a novel, this could be the last edition
Realize what you do and start to make the right decision
If you’re seeking trouble, time to change your position
Our generation can’t survive in critical conditions
