[Verse 1: Ryu]
Better call them coppers quick
You don't wanna hear them choppers spit
Run up on em with a black component
Crack his dome for talking shit
Who the fuck he think he is?
I don't know but he runs his lips
I'm gonna get em in a minute
Gonna put em in a little bitty box and tongue his bitch
And I mean it
What I mean is
On the beat I'm a demon breathin'
Red Dragon yup saggin' doggy my pants to my penis
Extremist
When I'm the mood, better move and duck sucker
Be cool
Them Demigoons don't give a fuck fucker
What about that dough you got?
What about that Rov' you bought?
If anybody wanna bet you ballin' bitch I'm all in, no you not
Uh uh
I swear it
Your broke it's
Apparent
Them S.O.B.s beastin' the beat and I'm incoherent
Embarrassed and smoked your parents can barely bare it
Their only son is a joke compared to the ranch he's a carrot
A parrot mockin' my sister's style with at Mary Poppins
All you hear is me cockin' it back and it's ch ch ch POW!

[Hook]
Take that
Get the mask
Take that
Take the cash
Come and get ya face slapped
Yea boy I'mma bust that ass
Take that
Get the mask
Take that
Take the cash
Come and get ya face slapped
Yea boy I'mma bust that ass

[Verse 2: Tak]
Yeah
When I get my hands up on this weapon best believe there's mayhem
Taxidermy, wax a birdie, bully in this play pen
Zip his belly button to his face
In position with the tanks
Gotta mention K-9 sniff 'em by the lakes
Whoa
Supersonic, doo doo vomit, get ya fuckin crew demolished
See I grew my roots in music while you hoola hoop through college
Better wear some protective gear they don't care 'bout ya record here
And if they do we wish you luck
Whoopdy whoop
Squish his guts
You don't wanna get ya back sweaty put 'em in a jar and twist the lids
Slain with a red and black machete
Poor little boy was just a kid
Spread the news, teleprompter
Yeah this beat is hella proper
Servin' these stupid vermin
And ship 'em back to hell with out them
It's a rap, sew his tissue, tell the ref to blow the whistle
Stash his helmet in his locker with a Super Soaker pistol

[Ryu]
Get the missile
Get the gun
You don't wanna see me one on one
Pick the mission here we come
In position what you want?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
DUMP
This ho bitch
DUMP
This whole clip
Oh shit, Demigodzillas, them boys is so sick
I'm not bogus I'm excellent at this rap stuff
And you ain't prejudice if you runnin' fast from that black truck
Just ask us cause we in the back
With a sack of 'dro, Colt 44's
We street boys across the globe
You Beach Boys in Kokomo
I'll strip a ho for all she's got
That's how we do it in that dirty south
I'm Noah's Ark transportin' wolves, open up the do' and let the birdies out
You heard us now from word of mouth
And yes we hotter than ovens (yep)
But now we got this market cornered in this mother
Plus this record's on Warner Brothers, motherfuckers (yeah)
Menacing maniac, miggity Machine Shop top mechanic
For shiggity swiggity swingin' machetes
Pass the glittity Glock, I'mma bliggity blam it's
Celph Titled with a cannon in each hand
I aim better than the police can
So what's it gonna be fam?
Front like you He-Man and I'll be god damn
I'll burn your body with firework flare shots
And leave you with more loose stools than a bar chair repair shop

[Hook]
