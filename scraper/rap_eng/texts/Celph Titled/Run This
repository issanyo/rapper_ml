[Hook: Esoteric]
You wanna (change the game)
Cha-cha (chasin' fame)
We run this, that will (stay the same)
You better (pray for rain)
Bow when you (say the name)
We got this, please stay (in your lane)

[Verse 1: Esoteric]
If may surprise you dog, but we ain't alike
A K-Swiss kick thug just ain't a Nike
The name's Esoteric, I possess true skill
You a flash in the pan like D-Wade on Blue Hill
Ave
It ain't hard for you to get
That line, if you from Boston, if you ain't Google it
And I don't Gossip Girl but Leighton Meester
She could get it easy like a Kool G. Rap feature
MC's
Straight up, I'll peel they cap
I ain't gonna shoot up fools though to kill they track
Listen
As the horns blow
It's King Corso
Callin' out actors like award shows
Even more so
Now that I'm insane
Our RPG's ain't the same
I'm a Rocket Propelled Grenade
You a Role Playin' Gay and hail Caesar
The only gun charge you got is your Super Soaker on your Visa

[Hook: Esoteric]
You wanna (change the game)
Cha-cha (chasin' fame)
We run this, that will (stay the same)
You better (pray for rain)
Bow when you (say the name)
We got this, please stay (in your lane)

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
9 milli with the lemon squeeze (aim and you gone)
Iced out grenade pendant (my chain is the bomb)
A pale skin Cuban?
They not ready for the presence of one
How much melanin? None
But raps slap harder than elephant guns (dang!)
I'm no jokin'
Already busted your nose open bitch now I'm just show boatin'
Always pack a banger mayne, even when I'm in Bangor, Maine
The Army and the Godz run shit it'll stay the same (yeah!)
Spray your frame not an artist
You shop at Kanye's Boutique
Wash your hair with Garnier Fructis (Wow)
Spit 16s when my grin's mean
Put so many rappers in trunks I'm coachin swim teams (ha!)
Don't ride your bike across my lawn comin' to see me
Cause them land mines will fly you cross the moon like E.T
Spider-Man with a scope, aim at you through my web site
Though I was gonna shoot you?
You was dead right
