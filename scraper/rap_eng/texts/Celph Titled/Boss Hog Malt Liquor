{*static noise*}
Take me to a commercial

[Commercial break]
{*belch*} Oh shit, I gotta run to the liquor sto'
See what they got in this motherfucker, get me a drink
What they got in this fuckin freezer here man

[Ice Cube] Drop a old school beat!

[High pitched voice]
Man, fuck St. Ide's and Olde English god damnit
You ain't got nothin different in this motherfucker?

[J-Zone]
Here's a toast to a new drink, a new thing
A new brew just for you to put yo' dick in a sling
Boss Hog Malt Liquor, whether chillin the park
Or on the creep with a bitch you'd only fuck in the dark
100%, real man in a glass jug
Take a sip it feels better than a fast nut
Motherfuck a Michelob, tell that ho to strip her clothes
Or dick'll be on swoll, buy the 40 or the sixty-fo'

[Celph Titled]
Yo, here we go you wanna search for a buzz
We got the type of beer make a bitch thirst for the suds
And birds chirpin it up, they wanna lick on the log
We guarantee no hangovers if you stick with the Hog
Yeah Nelly got Pimp Juice, Lil Jon got Crunk Juice
Lil' sip of this'll let the motherfuckin funk loose
Serve it out the bottle, only need one glass
For a room of stupid hoes so you can get dumb ass

[Singing]
Motherfuck a Mich-elob!
Stack yo' chips, hit the sto'!
Take a sip, and hit your ho
Boss Hog Malt Liquor

[Advertiser voice]
And comin Christmas 2006, Boss Hog Egg Nog
Keepin you fucked up for all family functions
(Ho Ho Ho) Boss Hog'n!
