[Verse One] [K-Skills]
Yeah bitch
Ayo it's K-Skills, the bangin' Puerto Rican lady chaser
Rhyme maker, glow dime breaker, speed your pace up
I'm miles ahead of the competition, stop and listen closely
Niggas with them wack Casio beats, don't even approach me
Or I'm gonna throw your beat tape in the waste basket faggot
Go in your crib, break your sample like a bad habit
The only way you're gonna get large is if you spit hard
Got heads waitin' for me shit like Super Bowl kick off
I lay clit and burn incense, when the spliffs on
Can't stop rockin'? C'mon, you got the shit wrong
I'm doin' me
Don't give a fuck who you be
You talk a good one, but on the real you ain't foolin' me
I'm tryin' to pull a G times three on every fifteenth
Drop an album every two years, keep my production sweet
Build something for myself, spread the wealth to my seeds
Greenbacks, weed and a mami, son what else do I need?

[Chorus] [K-Skills] [x2]
Bring it on, let me know who's fuckin' around?
Celph Titled and K-Skills, yeah, you're lovin' the sound
From Maryland to NY, this is how we runnin' it down
It's time to surface from under the ground, under the ground

[Verse Two] [Celph Titled]
Whenever Celph Titled drop shit you niggas better cop it
I don't get head in the whip, I get my cock sucked in a cockpit
I'm no joke, I'll pull out in broad daylight
Hip hop ain't nothin' but a bitch to me so I'ma rape this mic
You couldn't spit if you was a white boy, chewin' tobacco
I'm a live nigga, gettin' doe, doin' fiascoes
Let the buck fifty donate some stab wounds
And fire Buckshots like Priority did to Black Moon
I'm out for street fame whether it be rockin' mics
Or pullin' Glocks in heists, knockin' niggas off of motor bikes
My pockets stay thicker than a males eyebrows
And my style without a doubt is quick to put your lights out
Leave you iced out
Stranded in Antarctica
My canon's hit harder when bullets fly sparkin' your Nautica
Motherfucker this is New York's finest
Comin' loud and clear but now it's time to get the fuck up out of here

[Chorus] [K-Skills] [x2]
Bring it on, let me know who's fuckin' around?
Celph Titled and K-Skills, yeah, you're lovin' the sound
From Maryland to NY, this is how we runnin' it down
It's time to surface from under the ground, under the ground

[Verse Three] [K-Skills]
I get better in time like The Whispers
Gettin' money like Asian restaurants, on Yu street, with the tip cups
My ? audio, merry-go-rounds in stereo sound
Turnin' D.C. into a burial ground

[Celph Titled]
Fuckin' around with these niggas and you might just get your faced ripped off
By the semiautomatic lettin' the clip off
I be the raw spic that'll leave your fuckin' jaw split
If this is a battle, congratulations; you just lost it

[Scratch Chorus]
