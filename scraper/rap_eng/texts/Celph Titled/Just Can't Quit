[Scratch Hook]:
"Blunt passin', music blastin'"
"Music blastin'"
"I got the blunt passin', music blastin' but I just can't quit"
"Roll up the next blunt"
"And roll up the next blunt"
"And roll up the next blunt"
"Because I just can't quit"
"I got the music"

[Verse One] [Apathy]:
Bumpin' so hard my bitches boobs bounce
I'm on my way to Mo's house he's probably breakin' up an ounce
(No doubt)
Gotta stop for a bottle of Febreze
I'm not even smokin' and all my clothes smell like trees
Weed clouds in the air and I'm sure that my X-Box
Got more residue than Jr. Gong's dreadlocks
Speaker box hooked to the amp wires quick
Now I'm out for Blood like a vampire Crip
With the
"Music, music blastin'"
"Time, time for some action" - Cypress Hill

[Celph Titled]:
I'm in my Cadillac but you can't see cause of the black tint
(Is that really him?)
Celph Titled is really ten times the cobra slither
(A reptilian)
And he'll rep till he in, a casket
But until then (he's a bastard)
Stealin' from donation baskets
Holdin' a gat on the front of his motivation pamphlet

[Scratch Hook]:
"Got the blunt passin, music blastin'"
"Music blastin'"
"But I just can't quit"
"Roll up the next blunt"
"Roll up the next blunt"
"Roll up the next blunt"
"Because I just can't quit"
"I got the blunt, blunt passin'"

[Verse Ttwo] [Motive]:
With a little bit of hash and
So high it sound like I got a down south accent
I'm laughin' at all this traffic like it ain't no thang
My music blast past dudes in the breakdown lane
Big Daddy with the 'caine No Half Steps
A sad set, stretch cats long giraffe necks
Puff piff by the pound, eye's slanted man
Like my moms used to fuck around with Jackie Chan

[Blacastan]:
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Sit back relax and watch Demigodz twirl
Collectin' samples, all around the world
Poppin' up in stripper joints, blowin' with ol' girl
She bend over then I blew it in her puss
This shit here is called watermelon kush
Hold your nose, the contact is meaner
Roll up, out west the grass is greener

[Scratch Hook]:
"Got the blunt passin, music blastin'"
"Music blastin'"
"But I just can't quit"
"Roll up the next blunt"
"Roll up the next blunt"
"Roll up the next blunt"
"Because I just can't quit"
"I got the blunt, blunt passin'"

[Verse Three] [Ryu]:
Beat rappin', hail to the chief
Man I sail through the streets in a Jeep like a sea captain
Ahoy faggots, suuuuu
All hands on deck
You all stink but I reek havoc so
Keep at it, I'mma smack you with a skeet napkin
Lets just chill and wait until the beef passes
Uh huh, ain't nothin' happenin'
Music blastin', blunt passin'
Give me that mac-10
Bllllllatttt

[Scoop Deville]:
Put a little weed in this place
And watch the joke go around like collection plates
So roll up the next blunt I ain't got time to waste
He hear the bass in ya face as I give you a taste
The gun on my waist put him in a casket case
Bitch please, you about as gangsta as Pastor Ma$e
Where I'm from, these California slums be tougher in my lungs
What I'm smokin' got me speakin' in tongues

[Scratch Hook]:
"Got the blunt passin, music blastin'"
"Music blastin'"
"But I just can't quit"
"Roll up the next blunt"
"Roll up the next blunt"
"Roll up the next blunt"
"Because I just can't quit"
"I got the blunt, blunt passin'"
