[Intro:]
Yeah
Hip Hop fanatic
I'll teach you a lesson now!

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Way back in the days before the age of gold chains and fat fades
When Zulu Nation was still called the Black Spades
A fetus was formed, a genius was born
Adidas was worn, and pieces of ya speakers was torn
I used to fiend for mics like and addict with rocks
The baddest on blocks who'd rock till the static would stop
Herbs beatin' me with words was absurd
Like traffic cops who cocked semi-automatic Glocks to pop
Stetsosonic was hot; Kwame was not
I wore out the shell tops they copped when Planet Rock dropped
From Ultramag MC's to JB's, BDP and KMD I learned to MC
Crumple it up, scratch it out, think it over
Spit it over and over the instrumental of The Bridge Is Over
I was funky-fresh, dressed to impress
Got it made with the words that I manifest
You'll never dismantle the best, give your mandibles a rest
I eat mics I bless like a cannibal with flesh
Still number one like It's KRS
With my whole name written across my chest
And it goes, "A" for accurate, "P" for poetry
"A" for the automatic respect you're showin' me
"T" for the tight lyrics and "H" 'cause shit is hot
And last but not least, "Y"... Why not!

[Chorus: Apathy]
With the kicks, snares, kicks and hi hats
Skilled in the trade of that ol' boom bap
With the kicks, snares, kicks and hi hats
Skilled in the trade of that ol' boom bap
With the kicks, snares, kicks and hi hats
Skilled in the trade of that ol' boom bap
With the kicks, snares, kicks and hi hats
Skilled in the trade of that ol' boom bap

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Yo, Let's meet up in the Bronx with Cyrus for a meetin'
Before he started speakin', they blasted him leavin' him bleedin'
And everybody runnin', searchin' for escape
Twenty years later I'm makin' moves tryin' to push a demo tape
And it's relative, this hip hop scene is too negative
Amped up and wild, take a sedative
Back in the past when Grandmaster Flash started to scratch
They perfected the art of the raps, takin' a part of the wax
Make it the heart of the track, now it's a part of the past
All of it's wack, fuck lacin' a DAT
I'd rather lace my Adidas, the beat is takin' it back
To the breakin' and graf, punchlines that made us laugh
Dookie gold chain and four finger rings to match
Mercedes Benz on medallions and Kangol hats
Even Big Daddy Kane had the hoes to sex
Pete Rock and CL Smooth with the pose on the Lex
Tommy Hilfiger, Girbauds and Polo sets
B Boy stance while waiting for your foes to flex
Photos with Gucci airbrush backdrops
Cardboard box on blacktops and the birth of crack spots
Melle had to wonder why he kept from going under
But the strength of hip hop got stronger every summer

[Chorus: Apathy]
With the kicks, snares, kicks and hi hats
Skilled in the trade of that ol' boom bap
With the kicks, snares, kicks and hi hats
Skilled in the trade of that ol' boom bap
With the kicks, snares, kicks and hi hats
Skilled in the trade of that ol' boom bap
With the kicks, snares, kicks and hi hats
Skilled in the trade of that ol' boom bap
