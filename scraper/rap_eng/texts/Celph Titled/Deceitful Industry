Yo
Snowgoons
Celph Titled
Yo, Celph, tell 'em what the deal is

[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
I've seen your kind before, thinking they're a hard act
But they're not soldiers, they're construction workers wearing hard hats
Commander in chief, so I chief, where's my cigar at?
Try to Xerox copy me and I'm letting the carbon clap
Plus your bars is wack and you ain't the sharpest cat
Instant-blow encryption code so there's no disarming that (boom!)
It'll blow up in your faces, like faulty fireworks cases
Unleash the murderers and rapists, so evil they murdering Satan
(They is!) Then you'll get socked around
Like chess players competing in professional soccer rounds
(Celph, how'd you get so nice, man?) Thank you for asking
My regimen is syzzurp mixed with battery acid
So when I'm rapping at you, you'll get ulcers and comas
Tornadoes, explosions, blowin' you over to Tulsa, Oklahoma
Force foes into foreclosure, you're sweeter than orange soda
Creep right past you in your crib before the door closes

[Chorus: (x2)]
Fuck what you been told
Shit-talkers, I'm killing your conversation
Who the hell you think you foolin'
The industry got me flippin'

[Verse 2: Sicknature]
I've seen your kind before, suited creeps on an ego mode
Hard to look through, elusive thiefs in cohiba smoke
Using a cheap speech with a deceitful code
Making sure there's no way back like using ouijas that the reaper broke
Artists get adjusted and toned, evoking the dissonance
No longer pulling strings, instead they roll with the blow instrument
Sound like they're gettting fucked with a cobra, chocking on cocks
While they fill up the tub, ready to dump in the toaster
Only stripes they earned was a bar code, never able to grow
They're stuck in your facade kitchen preparing your hoax
I bring the hard shit, too raw for the masses
While they just wait for magic shit to happen
Like they're having unicorn horns in their asses
Cause you dont give a fuck about their plans or resumes
You just need their balls in your hands to meditate
I'll never feed your machine, me sign with a big major?
... Fuck you! â€” signed Sicknature!

[Chorus: (x2)]
Fuck what you been told
Shit-talkers, I'm killing your conversation
Who the hell you think you foolin'
The industry got me flippin'
