[Intro: Celph Titled]
Bitch
Poltergeist, Celph Titled, and Capitole D
Fuckers
Yeah, yo

[Verse One: Celph Titled]
I hear the demons talkin' in my head, tellin' me to murk somethin'
Spray bottle filled with strychnine, press the squirt button
You a hater and we blastin', my fan club street team members just happen to be trained assassins
Stash in the barn yard, it's bail money
Put the yay in Glad bags, weigh 'em on the scale for me
The evil in me, it lives there
Drive your family van into a zoo exhibit, and leave your kids there
So ease off the tough guy act
When I squeeze, slugs fly at your snapback hat, make the brim fly back
The Glock'll punish you
Say you handle beef, but you work at the store stocking Lunchables
Once your rigor mortis sets, I'm throwin' up my set
Detonatin' dynamite on your grave and shootin' up what's left
So next time you crowd surf, come out your skirt
I make the pounds work and leave your body in the outskirts

[Verse Two: Capitole D]
See, I remember everything like it coulda been last night
Demons creepin' in my house and they try to kill Cap's life
Manifestation of evil forces when I write
As people waitin' to see my deadly performance on the mic
Memories are faded, everything I get is written down
Flipping trough the pages of the stories like a killa clown
Can you believe that I murdered in mass amounts
Capitole D getting cash and the burner, I fiend to count
What I got, get it any way that I can and I got it now
Flashbacks to my brain it happens in sounds
Backpacks full of weed deliver into your town
I'll be painting cities green, get you wait for the pounds
Red tear.. yeah, tell me if you like
I'll rest here every other motherfucking night
In the city that bleeds
You fuckin' with the ghost life

Capitole D and Celph Titled
