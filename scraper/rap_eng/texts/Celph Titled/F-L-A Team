(Intro: Celph Titled)

In 1998 a rhyme commando unit dropped a classic joint by the name of ‘Fortress’
These men promptly emerged from the Fahrenheit 813 and to the Tampa Bay underground. Today, still wanted by the masses, they survive as soldiers of hip hop. If you’ve got wack shit, if no one else can help and if you can find them, then maybe, you can hire the F-L-A team

(Murdock)

Yo don’t you love when a fam come together
Murdock, Celph Titled Tino Vega, 813
The F-L-A team, it ain’t no stopping us now
It ain’t going to stop

(Verse 1: Murdock)
Mother fuckers better guard your grill
When F-L-A team gripping the steel
We sitting with your bitch, slipping her pills
Guerilla pimping style, gripping a mil
When I’m flipping the real
Y’all better go half before I get ill
Murdock come through with the chopper cocked
Pop, pop get up off my block, I won’t stop
Until the cops are dropped and drops are copped
And comes to the spot where my dog RK flash the rock
Stash the Glock so when it’s time for the war
We showing up at the door, so we conquistador
Hop out the truck blowing smoke from the raw
I’m a stay high whether I’m home or on tour
Spit rap, flip, let a mother fuck flip that
Whatever get the money, I’m with that
And we get too deep, we better get that
If you cock blocking on my crew, better quit that
Y’all chickens in the club better get back
Fake cats trying to give me left had daps
Shorty rock look good can I hit that
Come on back to the crib and let me split that
You with that? No doubt, I can dig that
G money, hell no I can’t have that
Smack your ass to the past like a flashback
And you ain’t smoking my weed, bitch pass that

(Chorus)
All my niggas where you at (We right here)
Hold it down (No doubt)
F-L-A Team, niggas in the 813 reign supreme

All my bitches where you at (We right here)
Hold it down (No doubt) F-L-A team
Bitches in the 813 reign supreme

(Verse 2: Celph Titled)
Yo, fuck that, niggas wanna rumble with us
They going to see stomach and guts as soon as we bust
Fully loaded ammo, commando, Panhandle Rambo
Jumping out of man holes rocking camo
Niggas know me from the way I hold heat
All this with full clips and sawed off shit
Floridius, amphibious nigga
Tampa where I’m from
Real heavy hitters
Teflon vest, Vietnam bomb threats, infrared scope low
Hit you with a chokehold Walkmen 2-D
Celph Titled keep an oozie
Dime bitches be like (Who’s he?)
This is the next level when we spit the heavy metal
Certified incredible and we stay ahead of you
Ghetto to borough we rep thorough
M 16 bazerko, that’s for sure, though
Grenade shrapnel, tear gas capsules
Mother fucking surplus, What you want asshole
Grip the Glock 9, nigga with the hot rhymes
Get your shit fucked up just off one line
8-1-3 to the NYC representation we stay blazing
Strictly for clapping, semi auto action
War head get trapped in all that blasting

All my niggas where you at (We right here)
Hold it down (No doubt)
F-L-A Team, niggas in the 813 reign supreme

All my bitches where you at (We right here)
Hold it down (No doubt) F-L-A team
Bitches in the 813 reign supreme

(Verse 3: Tino Vega)
You want to battle back with your averages raps
Got your savage strap, dick rider
Let the rougers fire
Camouflage hummer with the big tires
Desert Storm attire
Walkman nigga, never retire
Tino Vega blow your L’s high up
F-L-A team we keep our guns high up
Atomically while you make your brain fire
With the desert boy, a quick dry up
In the tropics you can’t top us
All you knockers really need to stop it
Word to logic digging in our pockets, yo
Hard head nigga like Canada bald bitches
Liquefy missiles try to miss you
Sludge boil when they call me leave enough gums sore
Can you corny, one shot from the oozie pump
Finish ‘em up, nigga’s whole body jump, end this shit up
You got your rhymes sucker, use your chips
Don’t step out of line make me bruise your clique
I don’t really give a damn who you with
Y’all better know who’s cassette this is
You can pump it in the trunk of your Lexuses
About to show the whole world who the geneix is boy

All my niggas where you at (We right here)
Hold it down (No doubt)
F-L-A Team, niggas in the 813 reign supreme

All my bitches where you at (We right here)
Hold it down (No doubt) F-L-A team
Bitches in the 813 reign supreme

(Tino Vega) That’s right
