[Hook: Apathy]
I got my boombox on
Demigodz on
This shit goes on and on and on

[Verse 1: Apathy]
It goes one for the money, two for the paper
Three for the doe, four for some more later
A shark in the water, I'm hard as Darth Vader
Lift you off your feet with a thought and slice you with a laser
I lay around lazy, I'm slightly crazy
Fuck my life up and just let my wifey save me
Cause I blow more money then a movie budget
My mom hates how I rap but the groupies love it
Uzi does it
Ap's whole crew be blunted
Fist up your girl's booty like a human Muppet
And I'm down to Fraggel Rock with my cock in Miss Piggy
Sippin' sizzurp with Bert, tryin' to spell Mississippi
Got a little thick chick, not as massive as Missy
But she look like Rihanna when I'm drunk and pissy
Pump ya fist, I fuck if ya cunt ain't fishy
But I got a Magnum up, raw humps are risky
That's supposed to be your wife? Pssst
She don't act like married
Got her in the palm of my hand like a Blackberry
Ap's very macked out, tricky as Dracula
You get your shit snatched like 50 in Africa
Abracadbra, disappear in an Accura
I send a van full of Demigod fans after ya
I ain't just a punk, I'm tryin' to wild in the song
I'm 'bout to spray up Warner Brothers for Styles of Beyond
Fuckin' with the boom-boom-click
Get Busy Committee, yes that's my shit
You'll feel the bark and the bite like DMX's mics
I've been nice since skateboards and BMX bikes
Now, I'm tatted up, bad as fuck, deeper than an aqueduct
Shit is over, wrap it up, drink beer, slap a slut
Lie, steal and cheat, pump rocks to crack heads
Y'all is stupid listenin' to what a rapper says

[Hook: Apathy]
Boombox on
Demigodz on
This shit goes on and on and on

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
Yeah, I'm ghost riding the Ghostbusters' Ecto hearse
You a god damn faggot in a retro shirt
My knuckles? Well?
I bet those hurt
Plus Ap and Celph got the best flows on Earth
So show and prove it
But you scared, only talk to me behind a fence like the neighbor from Home Improvement
And I'm Title "The Tool Man" Taylor with two blammers that's fatal
And yeah, I get quite the facial stare
Put your face on the stairs with your neck on the bottom floor
Walk you through hell without goggles on
And when the Godz and the Pharaohs form a hockey team
It'll make your posse seem the size of a coffee bean
When we roll deep, I'm in the coach's chair
Not sayin' I'm the leader, I'm just sittin' in the coach's chair
Am I ferocious? Yeah
To put it in perspective, it's like you're a gopher compared to a polar bear
I'm ice cold with the sharpest incisors
Murder She Wrote like Chaka Demus & Pliers
(Or that old bitch on the typewriter)
Cause either way, a female gon' witness how I eliminate
And fall in love with me like Guru be lovin' Lemonade
If I was on elimiDATE, I'd eliminate the date
Crack her head with Ike Turner commemorative dinner plates!
Illustrate hate, hop on the interstate and forget I'm awake

[Hook: Apathy] x2
Boombox on
