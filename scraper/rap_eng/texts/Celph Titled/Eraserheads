[Sample]

[Verse One]
[Celph Titled:]
The sound of my voice'll make stab wounds
Barber of the universe leavin' planets with half moons
I have assumed that those who choose to make rap music
Have no talent at music, so me and Vinnie came to grab ya head and put a gat to it
[Vinnie Paz:]
I bring the .45 Glock and the .38
AR-15 send their body to the pearly gates
Me and Celph ain't makin' happy music, this is purely hate
Tobe Hooper in this muthafucka cousin, saw his face
[Celph Titled:]
And when we holdin' the Tec, we'll put a hole in ya neck
Leavin' you with a permanent T-Pain vocal effect
I ain't a flossy dude, sippin' Mo'
But if I was, I'd pop the cork off in your bitch's asshole (Let 'em know)
[Vinnie Paz:]
That's how the ho get treated, she get the smut treatment
Toss her out the whip, leave her on the rough cement
Celph and Vinnie will deliver an abrupt beatin'
And the Walther 9M will leave your guts leakin'
[Celph Titled:]
Your video had the best special effects I seen
Had you in the projects usin' computer blue screens (Nah mean?)
[Vinnie Paz:]
You phony muthafuckas never held a ratchet ever
You was in the faggot bar with Kanye strapped in leather

[Sample-Triggered Hook]
"Boom-kacka-boom-boom, boom-kacka-boom-boom"
"Pow-pow, buck-buck, pow-buck"
"Bang-bang-bang just like the Ricochet Rabbit"
"For my arrival, rappers are teamin' up"
"Boom-kacka-boom-boom, boom-kacka-boom-boom"
"Pow-pow, buck-buck, pow-buck"
"Yo I'm strapped with the gat, step up, blat-blat!"
"You can suck my dick you little fuckin' bitch or blucka-blucka-blaow!"

[Verse Two]
[Celph Titled:]
I never thought I'd get a bitch pregnant ever
Until my main squeeze gave birth to a baby Beretta
(The more gravy the better), don't holla just yell
It's like the night before Christmas, I can't wait to see hell
[Vinnie Paz:]
I can't wait to see hell either
I'mma run up on the first muthafucka that I see with a rusty cleaver
I ain't a sucker neither, and no one fuck with Vinnie
Fat gut, wife-beater, pasta, I'm a fuckin' Guinea
[Celph Titled:]
I'll smash a mirror, I'll walk under a ladder
I'll let a black cat cross my path, it don't matter
Cause I ain't superstitious and I don't fear nothin'
You talkin' all that tough shit
[Vinnie Paz:]
But you's a queer frontin'
And y'all are snitch but let me tell you somethin', you ain't hear nothin'
I like to refer to my trigger as the fear button
I don't fear nothing either, I just cock the pistol
I like the way the bullet burst and what it do to tissue

[Sample-Triggered Hook]
"Boom-kacka-boom-boom, boom-kacka-boom-boom"
"Pow-pow, buck-buck, pow-buck"
"Bang-bang-bang just like the Ricochet Rabbit"
"For my arrival, rappers are teamin' up"
"Boom-kacka-boom-boom, boom-kacka-boom-boom"
"Pow-pow, buck-buck, pow-buck"
"Yo I'm strapped with the gat, step up, blat-blat!"
"You can suck my dick you little fuckin' bitch or blucka-blucka-blaow!"

[Verse Three]
[Vinnie Paz:]
Ayo we blazin' son
[Celph Titled:]
Like gang bangers with laser guns
My rap verses are curses and scriptures spit with a razor tongue
Nitwit, I play ancient drums
That conjure up demon spirits that appear in smoke out of a pagan's lungs
I'm everything hardcore, complex, original
Ya no want test the disciple of death
C. Titled is fresh like salmon at Red Lobster
And C. Titled's the best at blammin' hammers at imposters
Get ya ass whooped with automatic hazard causers
You can't make tables turn, you got bad revolvers
Faulty guns that go "click!" when you pull the trigger
Mines go "brriddtk brriddtk", it's sick when I pull the trigger
[Vinnie Paz:]
It don't matter how we get down, guns or rhymes
I'm white and raw like the perico chico, tons of dimes
I got a way with wild shit cousin, tons of crimes
Tons of .45's, AK's, tons of nines
