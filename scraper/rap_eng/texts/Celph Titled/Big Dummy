(Intro: Celph Titled)

Yo, you mother fuckers know the deal
This is Celph Titled, the mother fucking mother fucker
(Yo and this is Mareko, J kicking, signmo step brother)
Y’all some stupid bitches, you know that
(Stupid, stupid, stupid)
Or better yet, y’all some big dummies
That’s how we calling it
(Yup, yo)

(Verse 1: Mareko)
Yo, there’s two hundred and sixty six members on my hit list
But no added preservatives and digest the biscuits
Welcome to my humble abode mic metaphysics
Look inside of my stove stove and see if the bread is missing
Mr. Mareko that big bull-a, I’m tired, just trying to get some sleep
Like Rick ruler, you want beef, you want the mad butcher
I want to see who win in a fight between George Speights and Ram Booker
I’m uncle bully on the mic, if these beats were wearing that lingerie, I would molest
Them at night, yo I stepped in a fight that I started on purpose
He should have known my beats were for a bunch warriors like John Kerwin
You are not certain, don’t start speaking, last time I just put down my head
Like hide so no one could see me, oh how embarrassing
Man you guys are now stuck in the pits like Jennifer Anniston

(Chorus: Celph Titled)
You big dummy, damn your fun
Your breath smells bad and your girlfriends ugly
Plus your fat and you got no money
Nah nah nana nah nana nah

You big dummy, damn your fun
Your breath smells bad and your girlfriends ugly
Plus your fat and you got no money
Nah nah nana nah nana nah

(Verse 2: Celph Titled)
Yeah, yo, whoever want action could get they mug torn open
Shoot first and ask questions later, that’s the slogan
Mother fuck a pacifist, we bring wars to peace treaties
Steal from the needy and take a piss on your beat CD
Never smile for the press, I guess I’m hard pressed
And don’t like beef unless it’s really charred flesh
Teach the kids to bust cause they fast learners
My clique is like stove tops, we all carry burners
When we use them, my family start eating your face up
Leave you looking like Angie Martinez without makeup
Blaze up, you can’t believe the way I hustle stuff
95 degrees in July I’m selling earmuffs by the cases
I only dropped one single, count ‘em
Niggas already making The Best of Celph Titled albums
Y’all getting out done, no need to hear the outcome
You looking for a death wish, guess what, you’ve just found one

(Chorus: Celph Titled)
You big dummy, damn your fun
Your breath smells bad and your girlfriends ugly
Plus your fat and you got no money
Nah nah nana nah nana nah

You big dummy, damn your fun
Your breath smells bad and your girlfriends ugly
Plus your fat and you got no money
Nah nah nana nah nana nah

(Verse 3: Mareko)
Mareko, two thousand and three
My stories bound the beef
Loaded in the bottle and it’s yet to be found at the sea
You big dummies, I pull my pants down to the knees
So you clowns can see big things like P Money
I’m a bad boy, me and Puffy
Stay cruising down Beach Street in beach buggies
I greet the ugly face of death with a frown and open arms
While we’re both drunk in the back seat of a stolen car
You can catch me at the open bar
And that’s for real, with no strings attached like an old guitar
I’m convinced, you can do a set for free and you’ll still see
More spaces Donna Heckler’s teeth
Ba ba boom boom ba ba boom boom
My uncle only eats luckewild with ga rule
Ba ba boom boom ba ba boom boom
My uncle only eats luckewild with ga rule

(Chorus: Celph Titled)
You big dummy, damn your fun
Your breath smells bad and your girlfriends ugly
Plus your fat and you got no money
Nah nah nana nah nana nah

You big dummy, damn your fun
Your breath smells bad and your girlfriends ugly
Plus your fat and you got no money
Nah nah nana nah nana nah
