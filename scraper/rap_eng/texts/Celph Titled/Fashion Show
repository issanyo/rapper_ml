"Cause that's not hip hop that's a fashion show" - PMD 'Shade Business'
"What were you thinkin'?"
"I'll tell you"

[Celph Titled]
Too many drag queen rappers, Celph Titled will get savage at award shows
Your portfolio's below less than average
I'm with the Underclassmen
We'll leave you under mattresses and under cabinets
My guns will blast clips that'll leave you split in half with your ribs cracked
And your cabbage turned backwards, wrapped in plastic
I keep my gats in action
This here's my dedication
When I'm around you might be dead after an altercation
A thief in the night who keeps my teeth in the right
Position for razor blades in my grill, ready to take your life
My A alikes say I'm the Kool G reaper
I'm not from the Juice Crew, just here to juice you
And find some flesh to shoot through
Making tracks, you said you had a blazer
I thought you meant puttin' on a jacket cause I heard some crab shit when they slid the fader
And ain't nobody talkin' 'bout your features
The only buzz you got is feedback from karaoke speakers
