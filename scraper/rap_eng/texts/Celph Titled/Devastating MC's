[Intro/Verse 1: Esoteric]

Yo, yo, it's the E.S
Brought a couple cats with me
Shit's about to get sticky
Yo, yo

I used to think drinking was a real disgrace
Now I drink till' I can't feel my face
Drink till' I can't feel the bass up in Magic Mike's truck
Till' I'm like "what?" with my eyes shut
See me in the S-Class with the fly slut
While I see your ass with the messenger bag lockin' your bike up
I strike up a conversation with the heroine
Then shoot myself in the foot like using heroin
Fuckin' with the three of us, you can never win
Cause that was back then, now I stack yens
Date Asian chicks only to attract dem'
Cause every white chick I date likes my black friends
When I'm 65 I might have a black benz
Bark with the monocle, with the black lens
Buy mad art and take part in wack trends
In my midlife crisis with cash to spend

[Hook]
Cats don’t even want it with my crew
Don’t want this to escalate to somethin' deadly
Because there’s just no one fucking with these devastating mc’s
(We devastating)
And since you don’t seem to understand
You can ask your man
He can tell you all about the mics that we rip
When we’re living as these devastating mc’s
(We devastating)

[Verse Two - Celph Titled]
I spark fights with the mic and leave the pops screaming shambles
Fuck your mother doggystyle while I be grippin’ on her love handles
I use a sample and make it unrecognizable
My squad should fire you with a Mac-11 ignitable
Piss on a bible while you pray to your god
I do a torn shalathon, get infinite head nods
My insignia resembles that of rocket’s being launched
Record the sound of your head exploding and put it in a song
Dead you on the remix, making beats in the graveyard
We off the hook, the mat, the meat rack, and the fuckin’ radar
Stuck up hoes, how many times I gotta tell you right
I’d rather fuck a fat bitch with big titties and cellulite
Niggas are shook coming at me trying to act hard
When I know you watch Star Trek in a Captain Picard leotard
Numb you quick, smash your head into a jukebox
Which in effect will put you in a studio with Big and Pac
I’m no joke like Arsenio Hall’s stand-up
In a title bout I’d still knock you out even in handcuffs
This is the lingo for the next level niggas
Who put hand grenades in teddy bears and give ‘em out at Christmas
With precise accuracy destroy anatomies
I’m the nigga that gave that motherfuckin’ apple to Adam and Eve
Y’all ain’t ready for the return of the hard shit
Esoteric, Apathy, and Celph Titled with the rawness

[Hook]

[Verse Three - Apathy]
Now that the gods are older, we roll with whole squads of soldiers
And an entourage of broads to massage our shoulders
I only keep hoes to fold clothes and laundry
Feed me and fan me with leaves from a palm tree
Sitting on the throne like I’m Caesar from Rome
They put my joints in their whips ‘til their speakers are blown
When I speak, better let it seep deep in your dome
I’m like God, turnin’ blasphemous people to stone
Since the first chromosomes were created in sea foam
I drag my human bones to a plush beach home
When the serpent tried to trick me into copping his fruit
I slipped that shit in Eve’s drink and started knockin’ her boots
I’m like God, fuck mother Earth, started breakin’ atoms
Sexually your weak, you’re freaks fakin’ orgasms
I’m electromagnetically charged
A bolt of lightning explodes through the tip of my Bic pen when I’m writing
The fire-starter, my esophagus burns your phosphorous
Soft carcass, and causes your sarcophagus to burst in flames
Thugs gotta reverse their range
Cause when my verse is in range, the words hurt their brains
Experts convertin' verses into virtual shots
You feel the force like paratroopers in vertical drops
The Demigodz like a firing squad, with tech's shootin'
With three clips to remix this public execution

[Hook]
