[Verse One] [Apathy]:
Ayo I'm tryin' to be large
But if it don't happen with rappin'
I'mma start havin' kids and sell 'em to Michael Jackson
It's either that or I'm prepared to hustle rock
With so much weight in my pocket, my air bubbles pop
Bare knuckle box beats every time I spit
Till every mic that I hit is like "Stop I quit!"
Y'all are tryin' to be gangsta but it really don't work
When you walk around with shirts that are longer than skirts
That's some feminine shit, y'all should end that shit
Call your grandmoms up have her hem that shit
Everybody now-a-days got a friend that spit
But do the labels a favor and don't send that shit
I don't puff diesel but I'll cripple your block
Right in the middle of a drought get the pizzle to pop
Keep pussy in my peripheral, the focus is rap
But if you tryin' to get the dick bitch open ya trap

[Hook]:
Pick it up
You see I'm so damn dope
With a rope chain on
Man it'll cut ya throat
You see I'm, you see I'm so damn dope
Break, break, break, ya neck like a chicken wing
Profilin'
You see I'm so damn dope
With a rope chain on
Man it'll cut ya throat
You see I'm so damn dope
Break, break, break, ya neck like a chicken wing - Busy Bee 'Running Thangs'

[Verse Two] [Celph Titled]:
Pull your motherfuckin' chrome out boy, I'll pull your bones out
You little bitch blown out in any pad, crib, home, house
I'm on the couch with microphones out
Matter of fact phone Alf
Let him know I came to zone the fuck out
Smoke some pizzle with my home scouts
Y'all motherfuckers knew the deal since day one
Suck a dick and cut a check
Bust ya lip and cut ya neck
Fuck a bitch on some slutty sex, leave the pussy wrecked
Bomb igniter with a cigarette lighter
One flick will change a spark to a venomous fire
Now you up shit's creek with a swarm of Piranhas
At a petting zoo, I'm bettin' you, I touch more Llamas
In the FL I'm pimpin' these hoes
Not a gentleman though
That's why birds fly south when it's cold
And you know
Movin' weight off of a Panama pier
With a sack over my shoulder and a Santa Claus beard

[Hook]:
Pick it up
You see I'm so damn dope
With a rope chain on
Man it'll cut ya throat
You see I'm, you see I'm so damn dope
Break, break, break, ya neck like a chicken wing
Profilin'
You see I'm so damn dope
With a rope chain on
Man it'll cut ya throat
You see I'm so damn dope
Break, break, break, ya neck like a chicken wing

[Verse Three] [Ryu]:
When me and Celph get together on tracks forget it buddy
It's acidic, it melts everything in it's path
Half of you fags are finished so we throwin' a party
You can pick up your gift bags when you get to the clinic
Bitch ass trick, I'm sorry for your failed career
So I send you a six pack full of Belgium beer, sucka
You know we hoggin' it, tryin' to stay positive
Make a little money, you crazy? I'm takin' all of it
Demigodz, marvelous shit, from out the Depot
My alcohol tolerance more than all the water
Surrounding the state of Florida, Tampa to Puerto Rico
Huh
Tell your people I'll be seein' them soon
Out in Rio with a Speedo on, tanning in June
Margaritaville for real
Meda, you gotta kill beeotch
I'm on the beach screamin' viva la Machine Shop
Hey
How many pesos did we cop? Bobo you know

[Hook]:
Pick it up
You see I'm so damn dope
With a rope chain on
Man it'll cut ya throat
You see I'm, you see I'm so damn dope
Break, break, break, ya neck like a chicken wing
Profilin'
You see I'm so damn dope
With a rope chain on
Man it'll cut ya throat
You see I'm so damn dope
Break, break, break, ya neck like a chicken wing
