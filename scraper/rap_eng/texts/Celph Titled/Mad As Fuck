[Intro]
Another Celph Titled motherfuckin' banger!
Bllllllllaaaaat!

[Scratch Hook]
"I do damage but still I manage to lay low
Actual fact, (why black?) Cause I say so"
"Run for cover"
"They say I'm outta control"
"Run for cover"
"But I don't give a fuck though" - Lord Finesse 'You Know What I'm About'

[Verse One: Celph Titled]
You thought I was but I wasn't
I wasn't what you thought
I was what "wasn't" is or has ever been brought
From unknown dimensions (yep)
But did I mention I got 30 henchmen
That been in my infantry since infants
And that's how we get down, get down, get down my brother
If hip hop's dead then close the casket fucker
Get wrapped in barb wire, face down in car tires
Gas Super Soakers light the bonfire
I got more fire (what?)
Like a bat outta Hell fire, flyin', buyin' dark shades, sippin' white Zinfandel
R.I.P. Big L
You set the standard for my frame of lyricism
Say a name and my missiles hit 'em
Boom, bang, pow
Yeah, all of that stuff
Bitch, you couldn't fit my dick in a Mac truck
So I came back from the dead with loose screws
And beats with horns that sound somethin' like a moose screw (huh?)
I'm quite exquisite with it
I'm naughty kill it skillet
I'm on some Tretch and Tim Dog, Penicillin shit (damn)
I'm '92 Nasty Nas and Akinyele, '88 Daddy Kane
2070 Makaveli
My swordsmen specialize in contortion
Torture chamber in the same garage that I park my Porsche in
And dead bodies, chuck 'em in the bay
And I'mma summon Satan every time I hear Justin Timberlake

[Hook: Celph Titled]
Mad as fuck
That's how I've been since the beginnin'
Don't know why, but I hate everything livin'
I got a problem, yeah, I got a problem
Blllaaaat, to your noggin'
Face flat in the coffin

You think you got issues, I got issues
I'm mad as fuck so of course I'm gonna diss you
You think you got issues, I got issues
I'm mad as fuck so of course I'm gonna diss you

[Verse Two: Celph Titled]
I'm mad as fuck so of course I'm gonna diss y'all
The shit I pulled off in this game takes big balls
I'm a rap star from two different rap crews
A pale skin Cuban who's mistaken for a black dude
Cause my thunderous voice is deep on the mic
Sometimes it's Barry White sometimes it's Jesus Christ
Sometimes I'm eating mice like hungry pet snakes
That song with me and Juelz, my favorite Dipset tape
You should have copped it, if you didn't, hope you die slow
Starve you till your ribs touch, time to give you lipo
I'm mad nice though
(Right, that's fo' sho' homie)
I'm with your wife tho'
(Oh, fo' sho' she gon' blow me)
And I'm an O.G., in underground rap circles
I took it all over, just look at a map Erkle (you see that?)
I'mma murk you, but not right now
I'll lay you in the intersection with the stop lights out

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Celph Titled]
Splatter paint shotgun shells, look what my pellets made
I give opponents hellish fades with a propeller blade
Rockin' a ninja mask and infrared glasses
Lookin' really stupid, but really I'm right under your mattress
Keys to the safe, Desert Eagles and duct tape
I'm takin' e'rything down to your last cupcake
Motherfucker I got million dollar plans whether in or out of hand
You should just holler at me, I got you fam
No wack methods to my track record
I'm takin' Hell so you can have Heaven
Smack you if you half steppin'
I'm givin' math lessons at spelling bees
With a big black weapon if you don't fuckin' spell Celph with a "C"
There's only one way to go out
So I'm goin' out of my way to do sign language with hand grenades
My sharp teeth are like Ginsu diamonds
Y'all ain't men with Heisman, y'all are just men with hymens

[Hook]
