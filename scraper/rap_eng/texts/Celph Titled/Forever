[Intro: Mr. Rictor]
You have now entered the realms of
Rictor boy, Celph Titled the Rubix Cuban
Complex, Kimani of the Masterminds
And L-Fudge, a.k.a. El [?]
[?]'s in the mutha-(scratch) house
[?]

[Verse 1: Kimani]
You kicking it with divine minds
Define rhymes divide time and space
Mix New York with the ATL bass
I've been hard to trace (but now I)
Leave evidence of existence
K [?] rocks with persistence
Assistance is that your neck snaps
Fresh raps, veterans and wet backs
Agree that we fresh like Wet Naps
We set traps
Then set stacks and lesser rhyme books on fire
Mastermind drop til we retire
To a higher plane
Leaving the name engraved up in your hall of fame
Kid been riding the train
With the same walkman since '93, see I be
Holding it down for NYC, lively
The upper west residence, superior intelligent
Fresh like your breath after peppermint
Heaven sent these MC's to ease the pain
To all of y'all feeling like rappers just the same in the game

[Verse 2: L-Fudge]
I mastered arts ripping heads apart, literally
Strip you of your necessities and luxuries
I really could be
As much [?] and separated you
From everyone that you're related to and the ones who produced you duke
Long gone, erased all evidence
Of even once thinking that you was a Don Juan
Far from where you once used to stand at
And taken off the high pedestal where they once used to rest your raps at
Promotions is what determines your fate
And you know what's ill what's promoted [?] has kids learning to hate
Not sure of the science behind this
Enables them to sneak up and surprise us
Put barcodes in us have them scan [?] us
At any given time, and still not influence your shit
It's for everybody, at any one given rhyme
Keep a set frame of mind in these times
Or remain ignorant wait for the sun to surface and be shined

[Hook x2]
It goes hip, hop, hip-hop forever
Hip, hop, hip-hop forever
Say hip, hop, hip-hop forever
Say hip, hop, hip-hop forever

[Verse 3: Mr. Rictor]
What if I took L's concept and combined it with southern dialect
Would it be too complex for minds to master?
Ten years after, kids like "damn he flipped names,"
2009 they still lame
Confused, scatterbrained
Rappers talking nonsensical syntax
Maybe slice open their back and snip wires
Replace blood with gasoline and set fire
Bugged out, tip of my tongue get slugged out
Projectile thrower, more rhymes excel slower
Proceeding by a [?], you gotta be [?]

[Verse 4: Mr. Complex]
I pull over police when I'm in hot pursuit of my dreams
License and registration, representation come from Queens
I grab the mic [?], it's only right
The only right to remain silent
Still got a violent brain but I restrain from crime
Cuz every rhyme is closer
I'm too nice to murder, and vice versa
I [?] sing-alongs [?]
You can think of the worst thing to say, but what's worse is that
You're the exact definition of the word "wack"
You busting mad shots, here's your bullets back
Ay yo [?]
It's hard for me to contain the vomit rising in my throat

[Verse 5: Celph Titled]
We interrupt this scheduled broadcast to bring you the latest from...
Celph Titled live and direct, the Floridian architect
813 residency got you on the safety precaution tip
Placing grenades in backpacks, making sure the pins get lost quick
MCs is simple minded blindly writing rhymes in crayon (yo yo!)
You wanna talk to that kid I battled? Aight, let's have a seance
Rip your favorite idol to shreds like chemotherapy dread heads
You got a lot at stake, I'll spare ribs and break legs instead
Spitting grammar so any person, place, or thing gets sprayed with gamma ray
Energy unrefusable got me rocking shows at funerals
I'm steaming out the nostrils leading my headphone apostles
Believe me when you see these 5 MCs rip mics colossal
El Tremendo Cubano gleaming in the moonlight
One half of Equilibrium, one love to all my aolytes

[Hook x2]
