[Intro]
All aboard
Please keep your hands and feet in the cars

[Verse I]
Once upon a time on a line of the train to the burbs
Began a tour of sorts of the insanely disturbed
Home to psychos
Where the guiltiest types go
Filthy rich white folks who's kids like coke
There was a spooky guy Tom
Perusing Mein Kampf
Human time bomb collecting severed Jewish guy's arms
His daughter was cutie pie
"Aw, it's little Suzy!"
Saving up her babysitting funds to get an Uzi
The pregnant floozy on the couch
Oh that's Mrs. Tom riffing on
Some coke fuck though the baby isn't Tom's
And Mr. Johns down the block don't need another son
Let alone to have the bitch's husband come clutching guns
Plus it's fun to come inside your neighbor's wife
With your favorite knife
At her throat threatening to take her life
Plus it's still so much I haven't told about the place I like to call
Home sweet home, my very own freak show

[Hook]
Step right up
Welcome to the freak show
Boys and girls of all ages if you like smut
We got pedophiles rapists
Cannibals and racists
Perverts who have sex with animals and sadists
Right this way
Feast your eyes on this
Indecency of all types for all the little kids
We got fathers beating mothers
Sisters sleep with brothers
Secret undercover
It looks peaceful in the suburbs

[Verse II]
Moving right along
In my psycho song
We have the next agenda
The perverts and the clergymen and other sex offenders
Not the least of which on display
Are the dad's who like their little girl's in lingerie on parade
You got your pedophiles who aren't gay
Favorite meal "Send a child without grass on the playing field (Playball)"
Well in apartment A is one such guy that's starved for days
And he wants the legs of Jonbenet Ramsey on his plate
There's a guy who takes dogs on dates
If you get my drift
And he ain't got the worst idea for how to wet his dick
When the local mortician's on some necro shit
And he sticks his short dick in, in between some legs that stiff
What gets me is the way they choose to spill milk
When you could screw some built MILFs in a new silk quilt

[Bridge]
Dude that chick's a MILF
What's a MILF?
Mom I'd like to fuck

[Hook]

[Verse III]
Last but not least
This exhibit probably is the sickest
Worse than any inner city niggas with some biscuits
You know the cats I'm speaking of
The type that like to eat you up
And make a sandwich out of human meat for lunch
Well there's this guy around the corner
Who moved from California
Cause bodies rot quicker when it's warmer
And his former wife was so delicious out of her dress
In an hour or less
He devoured her flesh
Without no regrets
Then he moved out of the west to a sty that's much worse
A slaughterhouse out in a Long Island suburb
He was a low-life with no wife
And if his picket fence wasn't so high
You'd see his back yard was filled with old bikes
And if the cops weren't so blind and empty
They probably would have picked up on where he'd last been seen
Blood-soaked renting a truck from Penske
To dispose of abducted kids bones and ten-speeds

[Hook]
