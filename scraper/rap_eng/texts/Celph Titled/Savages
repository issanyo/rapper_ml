[Verse 1: Slaine]
I smell like American money, filled with heroin dummy
I’m the envy of all my enemies, they’ll never become me
I’m a gluttonous nut, trust me I’ll forever be hungry
God hates me, that’s why I talk to the Devil, he loves me
I’m the chosen [?] frozen in this cold asylum
Grew up in the code of silence, I rose in violence and
My mathematics makes sense if you know the science
I kidnap you and electrocute you with an old appliance
You trapped in the jungle with the boldest lions
Gimme, your hands jittery while you hold your irons
I been literally lost in my own defiance
Ever since Little League and I born in a home with giants
I ain’t talking about ‘bout the football team
Talking ‘bout part of the city that you could call mean
Beantown killers who have no second thoughts of stabbing kids
So I run around with criminals and savages

[Hook samples 1]
“Savage” “Animal thoughts” “Gorilla”
“Killas who stomp like Godzilla”
“[?] – we’re the first to kill”
“From the darkness” “I’m a motherfucking savage”
“Vicious, sinister” “Call me animal”
“Lunatic" "Leaving suckas extinct”
“Put fear in your heart”
“I’m sick with it” “Crazy” “’Cause I’m a motherfucking savage”

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
If I’m not a boss than who is, the land mine legislator
Saying how the haters, praying god is [?]
If I don’t entertain you and you clown me
Then why you let your brain entertain thoughts about me
Maybe because I’m that motherfucker no rapper comes abovva
Grandaddy grenade, mans pants, and rap structure
Get wrecked with a Milli Vanilli cover
Blame it on the rain when I’m slapping you silly, suckas
My watch and my vest match a wasp’s nest
‘Cause we both know the time when you disturb the statue
We pointing the stingers at you
With [?] triggers, reach handle heat like Mike Tyson
Handle pigeon feet (the metal and the beef)
If you physically fit but out-physically fit
You do a urinal drain, I am currently insane
Suck on a death, yeah got a nice ring to it
That’s why the don Marco provide the motherfucking theme music

[Hook samples 2]
“Savage” “gorilla” “call me animal”
“Killas, none iller, like Godzilla”
“[?] – we’re the first to kill”
“From the darkness” “I’m a motherfucking savage”
“Sinister, vicious, malicious, pure insanity”
“Lunatic" "Leaving suckas extinct”
“Put fear in your heart”
“I’m sick” “I’m a motherfucking savage”

[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
Ill Bill, heavy metal king
Metal thing settles things, triple six
Like the Devil’s kids, we forever sick
Cross between an [?] and a terrorist
Or between a never-ending war and a metal gig
Rhymecore festival, rifle exit wounds
Shoot out your eyeballs, testicles, you a vegetable
Brain dead, spray lead, rain deaf, reign of blood
From a lacerated sky I’m a bastard with a nine
[?] a master, who bangs and who chops it, scandalous drama
Hammers and lava, [?], cancerous virus
Mad as tyrants, ‘cause after [?] I dance with the lions
Just wrangle the wire, dramatically multiplying
[?] chances to die, pull big black ratchets and eye
Patches, defy language and lies, angle survivors
Planets align, it’s mathematical science
Me, Celph, Marco with Slaine, it’s a savage alliance

[Hook samples 3]
“I’m a savage” “Animal” “Killa” “gorilla”
“[?] – we’re the first to kill”
“Psychopath walking, no remorse”
“Psycho from the darkness” “I’m a motherfucking savage”

"Distinct" “Lunatic" "Leaving suckas” “Screaming”
“Put fear in your heart”
“Everybody knows I’m a motherfucking” “Savage”
