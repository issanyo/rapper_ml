{Welcome}

[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
Yo, stop breathing fog on my window
I reconfigured your pixel display to disguise shut down system icons as OK buttons
Modems fronting on connection rates, switching COM port data transfer levels to 2400 Baud
I'm living large like 2,000 terabyte drives in 30 90s
Just promoted to device manager—check my stats on Britannica
Encyclopedia, read-only media, hidden directories with password protection by all means (You know my steeze)
[?]. My flow been has encrypted and programmed to be equipped with the ill shit that most can't get with
My linguistics bring the noise, making connections fail
Overload your box and now you know that {You've got mail}
Minimize operations, control panel hiatus
I dropped the DOS for analog studies of orchestration
It's obsolete—1995 was then. Now it's 1998—we're taking over this update
Fuck Bill Gates. I macro hard, take your processes for hostage
All the way from 686 to 808D HD imposter
Mini tower boxes stuffed with too many program ruled devices, concise with mechanisms
Call the crisis center
I'm IBM compatible with any Macintosh contender
Catch me lounging at the task bar
The alcohol's on caps lock, picking up the tab
Shift my control to alternate delete you motherfuckers out the lab

[Bridge: DJ Kramtronix Scratches with Windows Sounds]

[Verse 2: Majik Most]
Fully activated, forever in a workshop
The universal sys ops is not my protocol
We hack through great codes and step through busted windows
Where silicon chips grow, crushing plastic landscape
From Pentium to N-e-x, adjust our broken keyboards
Restoring all mainframes and slice the phone line
On the internet, I roam across eternal syndrome
Chrome-plated Logitechs directs me towards the next intersect
Encrypting information, I damage workstations
Deface the databases like a race for technology
When deep inside the sectors of a one gig hard drive
I'm liver with no type of power management
Prevent all viruses, search for [?]
Now upload my thoughts {all done}, make your hardware go soft
Rhymes melt through ya modem cause I'm powered off radium
Waiting for selection of a hidden icon
A pointing device that can slice through menus
Continuing to wreck, dissecting all websites
Consuming the contents of a chat room that's wack
I react, making service collapse—now how's that?
Drop it with the carrier or three-hundred Baud
Navigating through directories and instant memory
Deep embedded in your system—on excursion you can find me
Tryna download the ninety nine beta version

[Outro: Celph Titled]
Not enough memory for ya Windows
POW! All systems are down
Not enough memory for ya Windows
POW! All systems are down
Not enough memory for ya Windows
Ya Windows, ya Windows
Windows 98
