[Verse 1:Apathy]
The boom box overloader,block overthrower
Hurricanes from my brain, knock your whole block over
Got a mask on my face but it’s not October
Hard to keep up with my pace so I gotta rock slower
Melt brain cells in your skull like a pot smoker
Takin' shots in the dark like cops with glaucoma
Keep the Glock on ya, right thumb over the hammer
The flow and the grammar is hooded like Cobra Commander
The closer you stand to the man and your skin’ll get tanner
I can make the whitest cracker rapper black as a panther
Ap is the answer, radiate your backup dancers
And the fans in the stands like I’m trying to cure cancer
Give me one clap, now give me two claps
Better rip your shit up and write some new raps
Saw that Transformer movie, gave it two thumbs down
'Cause it never made that sound

[Hook]
Getting strong now (We gettin' stronger every day)
Won't’ be long now (It won’t be long, we on the way)
The Demigodz is back, the Demigodz is back
The Demigodz is back, the Demigodz is back

[Verse 2:Ryu]
It’s Ryu motherfucker, slide through undercover
No food, got a hunger so you ain’t gotta wonder
If I’m back, I never left, relax and get the tech
My breath still smellin' like ass and cigarettes
My gat spray this way, thataway you bitch-made
Rappers I missed can still get it from the ricochet
Ever since mama was puttin' vodka in my Minute Maid
Walkin' down the block with a Flavor Flav clock
Same size as a dinner plate, see the way we spendin' papes
I don’t make it rain, nah it’s kinda like a tickertape parade
So be afraid, see your face be erased
We could take the game back, snap it’s a piece of cake, we back

[Hook]
Getting strong now (We gettin' stronger every day)
Won't’ be long now (It won’t be long, we on the way)
The Demigodz is back, the Demigodz is back
The Demigodz is back, the Demigodz is back

Why these muh'fuckers different?

[Verse 3:Celph Titled]
Demigodz is back? Hey that’s fuckin' awesome
I think I’m missin' my marbles, I’m kinda glad I lost 'em
I see the deep end near, looks like you’re going off it
And no you squares can’t fit inside my oval office
I’m going golfing except instead of that white ball
I’m teein' off of your head then it’s lights off
Yeah butane lighter with a Lysol can
Masked like the guy from Saw at your high school dance
Crank that soldier boy, you shouldn’t do that though
Clothesline a fag trying to superman that hoe
Check the rhymes and the flow (for sure), you know what I’m about bitch
Looked at rap, grabbed a razor, carved out my own niche
So fuck your whole organization
I’m nicer than any rapper you know and that’s not an exaggeration
If God gave me a gift, then I’m thankful for it (Why?)
'Cause it’s a God-given gift to stick a shank in your ribs

[Hook]
Getting strong now (We gettin' stronger every day)
Won't’ be long now (It won’t be long, we on the way)
The Demigodz is back, the Demigodz is back
The Demigodz is back, the Demigodz is back
