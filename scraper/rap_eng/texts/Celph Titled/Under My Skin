[Intro]
What's up baby? (Uh huh) Think you got me locked don't you? (Stupid)
Let me tell you something

[Hook]
I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin

[Verse One] [Apathy]
Let me tell you somethin', listen
I'm an Einstein with dimes
Give her fine wine
Wine and dine, in due time, that ass is mine
I've got chicks who send me pics of their tits over the Internet
Cause I stimulate they mental and respect their intellect
I tell 'em +Let's Get Dirty+
You think I was Redman
It's +Time 4 Sum Aksion+ when girls cop the web cam
Wanna pose for my cover?
Send a picture with your top off
Thick chicks
I'm a slick pervert who get's his rocks off by talkin' about your fantasies
Playin' Spanish honeys Marc Anthony
And fuck 'em underneath a bed canopy
(With stamina)
Doggy style, hammer a fly broad
(I'm slammin' her)
In front of the camera tripod
I got these whores on all fours like Centaurs
Hit "Ignore" when she calls, get the fuck off my balls
And the things that we talked about before you gave me head
I was just kiddin' about everything I said

[Hook]
I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin

[Verse Two] [Celph Titled]
Yo ain't it funny how these chicks think they got us pussy whipped?
But watch 'em get dehydrated when you take away the dick from their mouth
Crevices and various orifices
Chokin' on my nuts, still tryin' to sing my chorus's
I never gave a fuck about a bitch
But now I'm on some other shit
(Treat 'em like a dog)
And they just lovin' it
I admit it
I had a couple of wifeys
Or at least that's what they thought till the panties came off
Tellin' hoes I'm still a virgin at 24
So I can get 'em raw
Whether on tour or my garage floor
Girls, I got 'em locked
Like Super Lover C and Casanova Ron takin' bubble baths to soak in suds
(But still keep it filthy)
Without a question
(Yo Celph, you' fucked up)
You think I give off that impression?
Leavin' jealous kids in disbelief
I be gettin' more skins than an Indian Chief

[Hook]
I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin

[Bridge] [Apathy]
I love whores, whores, whores, whores
I do adore
Leave the drama at the door and your panties on the floor
If I hit you and I'm out on tour

[Verse Three] [Apathy]
Yep, Ap is the man
I'm graded on the ass of these dames
With a clothes hanger bent into the shape of my name
Handle above a hot flame but she never feels the pain
Or complains cause I got her gassed for my status and fame

[Celph Titled]
I don't have to explain
We got cars with extra throttles and switches
Don't give a fuck we stickin' bottles in bitches
Caviar on paper plates with fine linen cloth
Rotisserie flippin', women often in my rented loft

[Apathy]
I'm hittin' off
This little bird till she's gettin' off
And when we fuck she clucks and comes chicken croft
For every session while we sexin' I'm caressin' on her flesh and
Leavin' cum puddles in her mid section

[Celph Titled]
Listen, I got a real bad obsession
Girls who want long term affection get a long sperm injection
Stick my dick so far up in the pussy I numb it
Looks like the movie Alien when that little monster busts out the stomach

[Hook]
I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
