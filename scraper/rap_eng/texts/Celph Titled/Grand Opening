[Scratching]
Things are done different in my zip code
If you think I'm joking you're sadly mistaken
You wanna rumble? Well you can get crumbled
Today will be the grand opening of your chest

Things are done different in my zip code
If you think I'm joking you're sadly mistaken
You wanna rumble? Well you can get crumbled
Today will be the grand opening of your chest

[Verse 1:Planetary]
Severe rap, fear that, Philly bring the beards back
Trigger like a fish make a nigga change the beer tap
Grand opening, ready for that biznap
Streets full of blood, you ain't letting your kids out
I make a rapper wig out from the lyrics
They can't see me, I'm a spirit born to be fearless
I'm a promoter I'm colden days, shoot like a soldier blade
Throw a fit quick, probably break your fucking shoulder blades
It's only right I spit this verse on a cold night
Came to bring the flame and burn your rep for your whole life
I'm so nice competition is dead weight
A head case can't get my fucking head straight
My shit spit critical like a fed case
Crazy, got you niggas huffing that lead base
Massive meltdown, bring the red tape
Pharaoh clique rap keeping my breath break

[Hook:]
[Scratching]
Things are done different in my zip code
If you think I'm joking you're sadly mistaken
You wanna rumble? Well you can get crumbled
Today will be the grand opening of your chest

*Scratching*
Things are done different in my zip code
If you think I’m joking you’re sadly mistaken
You wanna rumble? Well you can get crumbled
Today will be the grand opening of your chest

[Verse 2:Celph Titled]
When the beef heat up it’ll pop the meat thermometer
Head on collision put your teeth full speed in the speedometer
The rapper rappers hate the most, my career blasting off
Cause I went underground platinum with The Gatalog
Four discs of torturer shit
And when I’m with my Pharaoh counterparts you get hit with the poisonous whip
My brother Doap Nixon the flow sickening
We put a bow on an opponent’s forehead cause the dork said he’s so gifted
(Oh no he didn’t) well yes I did
I’m wild like an orangutan mixed with a gang banging Mexican
Shining like the aurora borealis is
Swung so many nunchucks with my my thumb tucked my palm developed callouses
Armed with 40 calibers I will give you paralysis
We just set a date to bullet holes and mark your calendars
Huh I’m just honest so you can save your comments
Eat you for a cheap dinner like I just ate Ramen

[Hook]

[Verse 3:Doap Nixon]
Let's go, don't bang with me, fuckface get your shirt wet
Drunk monks sing lullabies with cursed vets
They tell me to stay strong when I feel weak
That's why I'm this monster when I kill beats
From Flyers to Bruins I'm with Elijah with ruins
My head wrapped but got ties with the Jewish
Yeah so pay homage cause I'm so on my own thing
It's like TNT when me and a microphone mix
Nothing but bangers added with anger
That means you can find me on your corner with bangers
I'm tired of these niggas yelling that they got shit
It ain't worth nothing when you step in a moshpit
My body shots will loosen up your bowels
My right hook will spin your wig around like an owl
So I really don't care when you tell me I'm foul
Cause the kid got class with incredible style
