(Intro: Celph Titled)

Remix, motherfuckers
What you want, motherfuckers
Celph Titled, Majik Most, Eternia
Motherfuckers, let’s go, come on
Ha, ha!

(Chorus x4: Celph Titled)
Brrr, stick em, ha ha ha stick em
What, stick em, ha ha ha stick em

(Verse 1: Celph Titled)

I blow your motherfucking head off at close range
It’s like you asked a bitch to suck your dick
You got no brains, Hold down the trigger
We got cases of belt ammo reloaders
The barrel of my gun looks like a flame thrower
Rapid fire, clap your messiah
But he ain't coming back in 3 days
Construction crews built a crack house over that fags grave
Looks like niggas went through airport security
No guns and no knives, ain't none of y'all is hurting me
I have the common courtesy to open doors for you
Throw you in the steam room and watch your corpse boil
You don’t want to see me pull the Mac out on these bitches
And catch more bodies than there’s Black Album remixes
You ain't hip hop, you use a snitch
You only use microphones for wiretaps
And targets for me to fire at
But I ain't shooting apples off your head stupid
I’ll shoot your Adam’s apple out your neck
And stick a worm through it

(Chorus)

(Verse 2: Majik Most)

Yo, I’ll strangle you with baseball gloves
And catch a case
Crime watching binoculars zoom in on my face
See me on license plates once I step in your state
I’m repping with weapons you can’t carry on your waist
Evil warlord with cannons and mortars
Samurai swords, mines under the floor boards
Get flamed and torched
I’ll jack your Ford Taurus
Launch it off a bridge, hit the water with force
Last thing you see is a squid and a seahorse
I’m the boss, top of the food chain
Macs and raps that collapse your rib cage
Put the pressure on, break spinal plates
Make the Russian in Rocky 4 look like David Spade
Yeah motherfucker, put your rep to the test
Bitch I’m a stab so many holes through your vest
The doctor’s like fuck it, I’m a golf on his chest

(Chorus)


(Verse 3: Eternia)

Believe me when I say that there
Ain't nobody that can get with us
You scared to bust the lyrics
Because you heard the DemiGodz dangerous
To hang with us or bang with us
Been talking about bite the dust
Fearful these adventures leave you with
Dentures and facial cuts
You think we playing?
Swing our sound every time we say it
Got you tracing back to the wreckage
Stay on, you best behavior
Plus you wasting time trying to get with mine
Think before you spit a rhyme
Fuck around and get left behind
Been rolling with the Demigodz
Since Solomon had concubine
Before water was turned to wine
Before Romans created time
Now we shine
Crippling your back with the lab attack
Blacking out on track to perfection
Lessons that never lacked
You the reason why we write our rhymes
In this aggressive way
And never fearful
Always be tearful lying in heresy
That’s how it stays
Days of spitting rhymes, and it never pays
Until one false prophet jumps on the stage and gets sprayed
I’m serious
