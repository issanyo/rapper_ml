[Intro]
Cavemen
(Got to be a joker, he just do what he please)
Captain Caveman
(Got to be a joker, he just do what he please)
Cavvvvvvemannnnnnn!
(Got to be a joker, he just do what he please)

[Hook: Apathy x2]
Cause I'm a motherfucking
(Caveman)
A motherfucking
(Neanderthal)
Dragging bitches by the hair, dead bodies everywhere, I'm a motherfucking
(Cavvvvvvemannnnnnn!)

[Verse 1: Apathy]
I'm the cryogenically frozen, released in an explosion
The labs on fire, meltin' the ice exposin'
A 6'2" club swingin', knuckle draggin'
Cro Magnon, Wal-Mart, white trash, pistol packin'
Beer chuggin', titty lovin', date rape druggin'
Thuggin' in the Dunkin' Donut parking lot, engine runnin'
In my pickup truck, pick up sluts
I ain't even picky get the pussy from this hussy
I a honkey leavin' hickys on her
(Caveman)
A whole different demographic
Anti democratic, conservative, hate faggots
Belly like a cannonball, modern day Neanderthal
Might've killed a mammoth in my youth but I can't recall
(Captain) Caveman in need of a brain scan, baby I like it raw
An Ol'Dirty Kane fan
Evolved from a troglodyte, paintin' cave art
Stealin' panties out of K-Mart

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: R.A. The Rugged Man]
Uncivilized, sub species, the cracker, the white
Troglodyte type, I'm a carnivorous Amorite
Been to the Gates Of Heaven but was already rejected
I'm the blue eyed, pitch fork swingin', leprosy infectin'
Nubian sisters, please stay away, better watch out
I'm the Caucasoid germ your daddy warned you about
Cave boy, cowboy, pistol in both holsters
I don't just rape women, I rape whole countries, I rape cultures
It's hard for me to be alive and stay righteous
I'm the guy that fucked the monkey and started the AIDS virus
I'm the Walt Disney creator of Uncle Remus
I'm the blue eyed painting of the white Jesus
I've been a demon since I was a fetus
Carvin' the nose off Egyptian sculptures
Hidin' the black features
I swing low like Jim Crow, I'm the dope dealer
I'm the Rock & Roll/Jazz/Rhythm Blues/Soul stealer
I'm the law makin', law breakin'
The nation's celebrating Satan every four years at the inauguration
And the White House is the plantation
The white boy, the negative naysayin'
The wrestling, lacrosse playin'
Bad breath stinkin', teeth decayin', bathing in bacon
I'm the bar brawlin', brass knuckle, bottle breakin'
The caveman!
(Cavvvvvvemannnnnnn!)

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
The pale Cuban, hairy chest, bearded bastard
Drinkin' beer faster, tractor truck steer rappers to pack it up
So here after the Caveman stomps shake the ground
This ape was found rippin' Rachael Rae out of that apron gown
No respect I give, the best that deal with skeet dispersal, be concerned
My heart's so cold my ribs got freezer burn
Walked into a slaughterhouse and got hungry for a Big Mac
Found me a slab of meat and had a feast of rib racks
Baseball bat at your mug
Yeah I should be doin' arenas, but I'm more popular with clubs
Fred Flintstone's a faggot
The Geico guys are faggots
Collect their flesh, Celph Titled is so savage
Brutal, primate, irate, I erase whatever I face
Alligator pit usin' humans as live bait
Committin' murders at high rates
I'm quick to slice a fuck, the cops try a stunt they'll need their motherfuckin' riot pump
Undeveloped forehead
Harder than a Foreman Grill
Football punted your head and it's in orbit still
The more I kill the more my primitive mind
Wants to go behind enemy lines and place proximity mines
It's been century's time, I don't evolve
I stay raw
Hunt for prey and never take the day off
I made a god damn grizzly bear a fur coat
Pig skin, arrow pouch, foul talk, no sterile mouth
I'm a...
(Cavvvvvvemannnnnnn!)
