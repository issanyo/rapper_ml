[Intro]
Blaaaat!
Yo, Green Lantern man
You know how we do, man
We shittin' on niggas dot com
New York connection, Miami connection
We a problem

[Verse One] [Celph Titled]
100 Miles & Runnin'
Celph Titled to hold the gun and
Put the pump to your stomach
Till they're pumpin' your stomach

[Ryu]
I'll be dumpin' every clip that don't fit in my waist
Butt naked with a shot gun
I'm Soul Escape

[Celph Titled]
You the L.A. Timmy McVeigh?

[Tak]
Nah, my name is Tak
And I tote a Glock till your shit splits and bricks
We airin' out laundry
A buck to clean ya
On a Cannon Ball Run
Quick tuck your knees up

[Celph Titled]
Fuck the streets up
It's a no brainer
Toe bangers
Run up in delivery rooms with coat hangers
Any buffoon that show anger (What?)
We bringin' plenty of goons with gold razors
That hold chrome lasers

[Ryu]
No stranger to beef
I'm a dangerous beast
In Shinoda's backyard
Chained to a tree
If you wanna act hard, stay 25 feet
Away
But they keep me on a 30 foot leash

[Hook]
[Scratching]
You can not fuck with this!
Fuck with this you wish you could
You can't my camp will kill you quick
[Scratching]
You can not fuck with this!
You can not fuck with this, we'll bust your shit
Demigodz and we get the place jumpin' bitch

Break it down

[Celph Titled talking]
Yea, Shinoda we told you we was gon fuck this up
From the Chrome Depot to the platinum Creepshow you stupid motherfuckers

[Verse Two] [Ryu]
I'll stab a knife in your chin
See your lights go dim
Me and the chain gang fresh out the psycho bin

[Celph Titled]
I'll strike again
Blastin' foes
With a rubber grip
Made from the same shit as Michael Jackson's nose

[Tak]
Yo, it's a wrap now
Casket closed
Still dippin' on fo' fo's
Wrapped in rose
Gats that will wet 'em like a plastic hose

[Celph Titled]
When I blaaaat the toast
You turn to Casper The Ghost

[Ryu]
You're done, that's it, adios
Back in the boat we tie a rope around your neck
Hang him after the show
Dump the body in a creek, now they wavin' a flag
Your shit is weak
Get the fuck off Bangers and Mash

[Celph Titled]
I'm back cravin' a blast when I walk into Star Bucks
With an A.R. tucked
Now watch me Star buck
Get 'em (Hit 'em) (Split 'em)
It's the D.E.M.I.G.O.D.Z
Easy

[Hook]
[Scratching]
You can not fuck with this!
Fuck with this you wish you could
You can't my camp will kill you quick
[Scratching]
You can not fuck with this!
You can not fuck with this, we'll bust your shit
Demigodz and we get the place jumpin' bitch

[Hook 2]
Back up, get backed up, get smacked up
Fall back and clapped up in a bag wrapped up
Everybody wanna know what's up
When Demigodz to all show they always fuck shit up
Back up, get backed up, get smacked up
Fall back and clapped up in a bag wrapped up
Every time we get rowdy and drunk
We puttin' cowards and punks
Dead bodies in trunks

[Verse Three] [Celph Titled]
It's a motherfuckin' party in here
We finna get big
Stab you in the leg with a shovel
Have a shin dig
Your girl next to you is scared to death
I'll blow that bitches wig off, put some hair on your chest

[Ryu]
Yes
I'm from that S.O.B
Here the guns go
Boom boom boom
Like a techno beat
Pop shit that'll make you wanna slit your wrist up
You still playin' doctor I'm on some Nip/Tuck

[Tak]
Yeah, line 'em up now
My cliques on
Hit hit time to touch down
To kick dope shit
Back for more
We make all y'all drop
That's the raw
That chrome piece goes pop

[Hook]
[Scratching]
You can not fuck with this!
Fuck with this you wish you could
You can't my camp will kill you quick
[Scratching]
You can not fuck with this!
You can not fuck with this, we'll bust your shit
Demigodz and we get the place jumpin' bitch

[Hook 2]
Back up, get backed up, get smacked up
Fall back and clapped up in a bag wrapped up
Everybody wanna know what's up
When Demigodz to all show they always fuck shit up
Back up, get backed up, get smacked up
Fall back and clapped up in a bag wrapped up
Every time we get rowdy and drunk
We puttin' cowards and punks
Dead bodies in trunks

[Scratching]
You know it's a fucking invasion
Green Lantern
