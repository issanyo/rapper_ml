[Jus Allah]
You might be the proud new father
I am their future martyr
Who slaughters like blood is the new water
Who's darker, who owns a tooth sharpener
Who's partner is a fool for his tool carver
No disputing, refutings, no eludings
Just shootings, feudings, no undoings
No diffusing, abusings, unexcusing
Shoestring removings becoming behooving
They don't pay me to kill but to stop killing
I don't hold my end of the deal, I should stop billing
Any lesser of an evil is not fulfilling
Don't text your house cleaner for a mop spilling
You're the trailer, teaser, I'm the feature
You ail, you're weaker, I am neither
I'm a leader, you're a cheater, deceiver
Easier, a receiver, breeder!

[Chief Kamachi]
Musical martyr who do it harder
Fresh to death, like a French funeral parlor
Church and Kamala hurts for the scholars
France holla, anywhere between the Earth and Shambhala
A black and white collar, grimy like crack pipe squalor
Trying to get a rap life dollar
Still spit it for shelltoes lottos with the velcros
It's killa code I dun did it till hell froze
Old school Guc jacket dirty elbows
My boombox blast the heavens
I talk shit, stuck bibles in the ass of reverends
They wonder what faith he is
Is he Muslim, Christian, or Atheist?
It don't matter, brain splatter just take a clip
Only present, ain't no way to escape the clique

[Vinnie Paz]
This a drama theme, you a faggot rapper drama queen
My body work is vicious quick enough to rock your spleen
Ain't nothin' funny sonny, even Vinnie's Glock is mean
Steady with a machete ready for me to chop your team
How is Bush still here, we shoulda been shot him
Hologram, Taliban, call me Vin Laden
You a new jack hustla, Vinnie been clockin'
You a new jack sucker, Vinnie been rockin'
I ain't hear you sucker, come a little closer
Close enough so I can rock you with a mini roaster (x2)

(Chorus)
These the last words of a nigga who's stressed
Shit on my mind, like "Can I live?", am I goin through death?
My first rhyme could be my last dependin on who's next in God's book nigga
I'm not shook, I'mma take it like a crook nigga
Slash on someone in the flesh, my roach lit
Got me spazzin and holdin my breath, I won't quit
Goin fast down a one way stretch in God's book nigga
I'm not shook I'mma take it like a crook nigga
Come on!
I'm a crook nigga, I'm a I'm a crook nigga (2x)

[Doap Nixon]
Everything ain't always what it seems
Either I blow steam, or fall back and blow cream
Cuz, the left hand's for the position of mic
I made a nigga wet himself when the mission ain't right
I'm on some OG shit, go fishin' at night
Scrub the jewels with toothpaste so the glisten is right
Fuckers, I'm on a level that you can't ignore
I prefer a boxcutter til' your face start to drip and pour
Catch me and Reef eating on South Beach
Smackin' niggas so hard his head'll leak out meat
Salute me or you better speak out peace
Cuz cats smoke so much oil niggas leak out grease
We play everyday just like the weekend
Because of Doap Nix
And the A to the O to the T to the P in this bitch

[Celph Titled]
Surgeon General's Warning:
I'm surgically injuring informants to resemble invalid deformed kids
Satan's orphan born forced to contort ribs
Expand my land look what one golf course did
Nine irons and three woods, goons with the spikey bats
Ali Baba swords swoosh-shaped in the Nike bag (damn)
Ask around they say for real "I'ma a rider man"
Ladies love my sniper aim 'plus they like my tiger fangs'
Spiders came, Oh!, from my grave when I rose out
Looked at the sphinx and, I chiseled the nose out
Fo'shizzle there's no doubt, the military unit of the Tibetan black magicians
Is here to make exact incisions
With radioactive equipment
And have you stabbed quick through your cheek flesh like we bass fishing
So crabs listen, there is no ass kissin'
Sloppy with my work, do my dirt with my mask missin'

[King Magnetic]
Flex guns like a shirtless jack
Half black, half animal cracker minus the circus box
I'm felt like Murs with the Slug
Emerge with a buzz
My words nerd's merged with a thug
Pride added to poverty equals robbery
Over larder weed with more traffic than Joggasee (??)
I'll eat your God degree, Allah decree
Stay in the cut like words wrote across the crease
Magnetic and Vin Paz, we been spazzed
Live fast from a quick slash to a skin graft
I'm a jail dude
It's harder to come up on bail dude
I'm harder than stomaching jail food
It's part of dumb luck that fail you
Right when you need it most
Squeezin' throats, choked til' your Caesar's close
I'm the reason that the Eagle's close
Rough times tough lines
Number five with the ?? poach

[Demoz]
Yo, who wanna get stabbed and shot?
Dig a hole, let the casket drop
Norman Bates back, pass the Glock
Shoot his face when I pass the block
Tell the world suck a dick, dirty ass, and twat
Moz
Sick in the head, ask my pop
He dead, fuck if he gone nigga ask a cop
I'm tellin God how I feel if he ask or not
I roll with Outerspace call me astronaut
Kamach, Kenny the Kid, Reef, and King
Vinnie blew the whistle last minute, D is in
Double G's, xanny popper mixing weed and gin
Spanish fleet when I pop up, let the demons in
Terrorize your whole hood, dirty T's and Timbs
I'ma birth the whole game, let the semen in
Nigga
I'm the mothafuckin' reason when
Niggas snitch niggas die
Put ya spliffs in the sky
