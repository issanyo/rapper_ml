[Intro]
Platinum plaques strapped on my back
Yeah, if you a fly girl come by the crib
I'll sign you, I don't even got a record label

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah this is Majik Most Yeah
This one's going platinum, i can feel it
Roll out the red carpet
Get a reporter with a fake tupe
I'm answering questions right after this, right after this

[Verse one]
You're a fake Majik Most with a goatee
Tryin be me, I'm ever MC's envy
You're just a mockery fly your head in mach 3
No one can stop me in my monopoly
Monotony is just not for me
I need a girl with a fat ass on top of me
One who likes to give sloppy head constantly
It gets real ugly... I got a porno fetish
So I'll have your girl wrestling in coleslaw lettuce
Forget hip-hop you don't got what it takes
I'll skip your demo tape like a rock across the lake
Wake up record dope tracks take my vitamins
And smack your mom on the ass
While she's cooking me breakfast I'm blessing you with this
Dope ass beats and the skills that you miss
Add me to your favourite MC list!

[Chorus]
Bitch you know it's Majik Most
And all his rhymes are dope
And you motherfuckers know
That he's got a lot of hoes

[Verse Two]
Ladies! Spread your cheeks
Cause everybody loves a freak
I hit the streets rolling deep in my hooptie with four groupies
And I make sure that they're all cuties
Rocking a fur coat and black derby hat
Pimping this track pointing out what you lack
I brainstorm while you write rain checks
It seems you got a super-market complex
Your style's butter milk making cheese and bread
But you're not fresh, so all that shit is dead
My blade to your throat as I'm holding your dreads
Decapitate you, make you quit while you're ahead
I'll fedex a snapshot of me about to drop
And when you sign for the envelope I jump down a chop your throat
You can quote me on any fact that wits out your back shake you up
Pull your cap off like artifacts

[Chorus]
Bitch you know it's Majik Most
And all his rhymes are dope
And you motherfuckers know
That he's got a lot of hoes

[Verse Three]
Smoothest kid you ever met in your life
Thats why I'm at your crib, chilling with your wife
I'm nice like that some say I'm conceded
But it's not like that, you're just mad cause you're wack
Matter-of-fact two seconds of air between two of my tracks
Is fatter than your whole fucking album black
So how you like that?
I'm off the foot rack, half step and catch a kick back
It doesn't matter where you at on the map
My crew will run through you
Come to your city and pull all your fly girls too
Give the credit where credit is due
I'm too dope you show me no love
Then secretly start a Majik Most fan club
Man, Tampa's in the house automatic respect
Come down south we'll fry your chicken neck
(yeah Majik Most, your little sister bought my single)

[Chorus]
Bitch you know it's Majik Most
And all his rhymes are dope
And you motherfuckers know
That he's got a lot of hoes
(Yeah I'm with your mom right now)
