[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Mutilate massacre mummies that's coming to maim you
Sit upon horseback with the skull of an angel
I have never seen God but I'm suddenly able
I was struggling with life, now I'm luckily stable
It's like a long cold knife that's stuck in the navel
Y'all are snake oil salesmen living the fable
If you ain't never been to Hell then I'm willing to take you
Death isn't initial but I'm willing and able
I will take your fucking food while I'm still at your table
The hunger pains is stunning mayne, feeling is fatal
I ain't never gonna leave cause Philly is faithful
Tully Blanchard, Ole Anderson still in the stable

[Verse 2: Reef the Lost Cauze]
From the land of lost dreams and broken pavements
Kids get killed right where Edgar Allan Poe wrote The Raven
Our great granddaddy was sold for a few shekels
So niggas will kill for eyeing some new J's and few pretzels
They might short a life for water ice, depending on what's sorta night
They having a stabbing in his jacket where he stored the knife
Get your beard faded
AOTP we're faded vodka and Henny and then we're blazing
The weed I smoke make you make weird faces
More fucking grass than where there was a deer grazing
Subhan Allah, yeah the hammer drawn
Years from now they'll tell the tale about the animal Cauze
Gone

[Hook: Crypt the Warchild] (x2)
Kill yourself, there's no way you can feel yourself
We make it easy for you, this may help
So if you think that you can fix yourself, slit your wrists yourself
We make it easy for you, this may help

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
You in karate class, I'm cocking shottys back
Fuck a stash box, I just keep mines on my lap
Ring my doorbell, and you're knocking on death's door
I told you I said war probably what you got on the vest for
The shooters on standby whoever said it's gangstas in
Your crew is a damn liar
Look, all I do in this rapping is gun speech
Lyrics I spit so hard, I chip my front teeth
And every Five Seven is a no-joker shoot a snowman
In your front yard, you'd think I had a snow blower
Hyped for the kill
I run 'round amp'd and after I fire them shots I'm doing a touchdown dance

[Verse 4: Esoteric]
Yo, the flyest spitting the murderous science fiction
I talk to these rappers like they're my personal Brian Griffin
You're lost in a raps addiction, you cannot deny you're listening
If you're fucking with the Pharaohs, you can wind up missing
Naimsaying?  Reminiscing on the past, as we drown in laughter
One leaks a meltdown disasters
Fukushima radioactive, holdin' cats captive
Spit raps with the force of a bull mastiff
Who wanna test the Eso, hoping that he get respected?
Who really wanna step and get their neck disconnected?
Akita snap the leash, rough and ragged beast
On my grind like jagged teeth, Mr. Fantastic reach

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 5: Crypt the Warchild]
These Pot Holes In My Lawn is wild drawn
Got Me, Myself and I from now on
Hating less can only make a love child spawn
Now I walk, with this cross I bear to die on
Ain't into holding grudges, let bygones be bygones
You's an earthworm, I'm a Burmese python
We ain't in the same lane, what the fuck is you high on?
Little alley cat ain't built to eat with a lion
Crash through the fences, I ain't reaching for no pylon
Team is light work, trying to fuck with an icon
Satanic spirits got you sleeping with your lights on
Do yourself a favor, take this .45 to cry on

[Verse 6: Apathy]
Shooby-doo-wop pop my switchblade
You ever seen a dead body overturned bitch maid
Your bitch made me a little sandwich when I managed
To leave her pantless and when she called my phone I spoke Spanish like:
"No hablo ingl√©s", sprayed it all on her face
Then ask her how them baby molecules taste
I make her booty wobble in place and bobble the bass
I'm a god up in space, got a lot of squads to erase
And every verse I kick, it's like the worse I get
I'm sick, tell Smurfette to smurf my dick
My clique, only wise men, kings of the North Star
The knucklehead hooligans, that fucked up ya sports bar

[Hook] (x2)
