(Intro: Mike Shinoda)

Unh, Shinoda, that's right
Ryu, Celph Titled, Demigodz
Dipset, Juelz Santana
And of course, Fort Minor
It's like ohhoohhh
D.E.M.I.G.O.D.Z
Like ohhoohhh
D.I.P.S.E.T
S.O.B

(Verse 1: Ryu)
I came from pumping 60K out the trunk
Switchblades Ziggy stuff nicknames, itchy braids, bitchmade
Faggots, my shit's changed, my cabbage is picked man
Rollin' twenties up like Snoop Doggy dog's crip game
But I'm out for the crown, housing, I'm buckin' 'em down
Dousing and dunking these fucking punks in a bucket and bounce
When I get up in the game beware
Put a pimp on a hope and then say your prayers
Got this ocean so damn potent player
Put you on a floor like a broken chair
You know it's a movement crack for the gods and goons
We back you talk about gats but don't actually use 'em
But I'm happy to do it because this is Demigodz
Celph Titled, Ryu with Tak, Apathy stupid

(Verse 2: Juelz Santana)
From bottom to top (I rose)
Chopping them rocks (and o's)
Cocking the Glock (and go)
No more of that
Now I just hop in the drop and go
To the most popular spots
With ho's and they know, there he go
I went from pumping that white stuff
To being up in them white clubs
Like hey, I got thugs still pumping that white stuff
Plus I fuck with the white boys, skaters and bike boys
We may act different but the struggles alike, boy
Shinoda know, if its a problem I'm coming over, yo
Quick fast in a hurry, knock it into overdose
And I mean that, just call if you need that
The best of both different worlds
Not often they see that

(Verse 3: Celph Titled)
We like these rappers here that you have to fear
We smacking queers murder extortion
Hustling, nothing stopping this movement
I swear we getting to the top this year
Got your ears, all eyes on me, old school 80's guy, that's me
Hip hop head female rappers give me dome
And That's just that hip hop head, flip off the feds, it's been said
I'm out my mind to the fullest, alone in the crib bugging
Fucking with Russian roulette with six bullets
Won't never free my guns but for show we letting them triggers go
Sparking that weapon, yous a thousand miles from me
You far from perfection and that's just food for thought
I'm moving the bar, rap entrepreneur, rap lord
Come to the hood, I'll bring you in through that trap door
It's Demigodz and it's Dipset, it's Doe Rakers and it's Bird Gang
That's Ryu, Celph and Santana
The best rap singers you ever done heard sing
