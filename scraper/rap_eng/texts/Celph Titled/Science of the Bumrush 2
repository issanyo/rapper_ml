[Intro:}

[Apathy:]
Yea, uh, uh, what uh
Yea, uh, what
Demigodz (No doubt)
Science of the Bumrush, volume 2 (Volume 2)
Quarter's in the meter (What'd you think?)
Un-stoppable, in-vincible (Uh, fuck that!)
Check, (yea) Apathetic and Celph Titled (What, sick on him)
We pimp it out like this...

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Yo I slip bitches roofies, snatch Muslim kufis
Still steal from the store and sneak into the movies
Playin' old Nintendo on black and white TV's
I got illegal cable and burn all of my CDs
Takin' toilet paper out of bathroom stalls
I'm hangin out over your house to make my long distance calls
Borrow kicks and gear and never give em back
Even if I like your song I'mma still say it's wack
When I'm blowin' off steam I'm just plain fuckin' mean
Dissin' little kids to give em low self-esteem
Got quarters in the meter when I hit you better stay down
You're gay now, and couldn't bus' if your name was Greyhound

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
Yo, I'm known for pullin' heists, pawn shops to hold my ice
Shiny Glocks leave you shook like that bitch in Poltergeist
I'm makin' rap loot from rhymin' and makin' hits
While you be beggin' niggas on websites just to check your shit
In fact the same fist that I hit you up with
Was found inside your bitch's clitoris after she sucked my dick
The Demigodz ain't give a fuck if you lovin' it
My clique hold heat, like Wolfgang Puck oven mitts
I stay in New York where my fam keep it gully
And any cypher I'm in the other rappers are my understudies
Step outta line and I'll draw you a chalk outline
I heard you did a joint with Puff Daddy and got out-shined
You just a gay rapper, lovin' what them fags do
You ain't had pussy since pussy had you
My whole entourage is known to beat you in the head to death
Apathy and Celph Titled the underground Red and Meth

[Verse 3: Apathy]
I got a white wifebeater, head wrap, and white sneakers
Uptown nikes they white, I'm the great white hype
Demigodz divin' in piles of diamonds
Brilliant, shimmerin', glimmerin', hustlin'
Swindlin', foes we're injurin'
Fuck chokin' a chicken
I'll choke a chicken for frontin' on the chocha
Chillin', chattin' with chicks on a Motorola
I keep my game tighter than pussy on junior high chicks
The fly shit that I spit got bitches ridin' my dick

[Verse 4: Celph Titled]
Yo, it ain't a question we representin' for derelicts
And lethal terrorists, my whole clique spittin' with arrogance
My rhyme caliber will melt through any teflon
And I got you wearing armor Fubu with an army suit on
Listen bucko
I'll fire flame your frame to stucco
And put you in the crevices, plastered against the window
You can't test this
I'll ice grill you 'til you write your last will and testament
And throw your body in the wet cement
I give a groupie bitch much love even if you're fat
I'll serve her ass some good dick rockin' a chef hat
Niggas know that when I let the rocket launcher blow
It's apocalypse and I'll be stockin' shit like extra Glocks and clips
Celph Titled the true ghetto visionary
That flip necessary messages like high position secretaries
I make you see more black than a Million March in molasses
In a solar eclipse wearin Ray Charles' glasses
You'll never do this shit right
I'll put your Ampex in spandex and even then your tracks still won't come out tight

[Verse 5: Apathy]
Stock market logic profit fattenin' my pockets
I'm relaxin' in the tropics with topless goddesses jockin' it
Now this is where it gets tricky
Chicks try to trick me but I never trick
Get head in the whip and then I split
Mack a better bitch
Bust nuts in guts like Beretta spit
Spit better than competitors spit but this is effortless
Drop gems since the beginnin' of time like Genesis
Got Jenna Jameson on the genitals, fuck a feminist
I support porn, and stripper hoes slippin' down poles
Lickin' chicken's titties and tickle em where the dick goes
I blessed her
Ran up in the dorm to molest her
Fuckin' college bitches
Peace! See you next semester, and I'm out
