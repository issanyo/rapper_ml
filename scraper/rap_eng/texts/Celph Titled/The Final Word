(Intro: L Fudge)

Yeah, yeah
Unh, unh
L Fudge, Celph Titled

(Verse 1: L Fudge)
You lack
Some minerals and vitamins—respect due to that
The average hip hop consumers now is like, “Who that?”
Songs nowadays ain't staying stuck in your brain.  It got
To the point that all songs that suck sound the same
I’m speaking on behalf of a third of us in the game
That, when dope comes up, they ain't announcing our names
Not running up in clubs screaming.  When my songs pumping
In ‘em, celeb status waning like Keenen
Ain’t bigheaded or gassed up—I'm staying on the cement
Don't want to hear that shit ‘round me.  Y’all playing with my feelings
‘Cause y'all couldn't help notice bitches raving over me, then
You automatically think they gave off fragrance of my semen
Pay attention closely to how stupid y'all look
Like a producer dropping dime on a loop Buddha took
Shit.  Back to the song, continuing, splitting lyrics
In half to the point, in the bathroom, you ask if it’s on
They’ll be like, “Yeah it is.  Don't his raps be the bomb?”  Listen
Once we’re done zipping up our pants, sing along
Bring it on whenever—that's how this shit’s supposed to be
I ain't new nice—I've been since “Hawaiian Sophie,” please

(Verse 2: Celph Titled)
You can't mislead a champion
Don Dada, Celph Pachino
Nice with the gun clap, get your front smacked
You not militant, so how can your rank hang
With a man that is quick enough to dodge
A bullet a point blank range
The 9 double M snub, real handle this
I don't puff weed, but I could still smoke Canibus
Upper echelon, at the Grammys, get my trophy on
I'm kind of childish, I'll choke you with a Pokemon
In fact, I like sex and violence so much
I have fantasies of busting off rounds when I fuck
Some say I'm a sick nigga, let the gun click nigga
Cuban spic nigga, why you all up on my dick, nigga?
I said it before, and I'm a say it again
I'd rather write with a knife and stab your ass with a pen
You couldn't release dope shit even if you at a kilo
Bitchs know my stee-lo and scream "Aye que Rico"
Celph Titled is lethal without enhancements
I'm like a tape deck that can't rewind, always advancing
I'll smack Swiss Beats over the head with his own Casio
And bring real hip hop back to my stage show
I don't know sign language so fuck a contract
That's what I speak, understand that
Wanna know what a real pussy feels like?
Why don't you stand in the corner and hug yourself real tight
Mother fucker

(Verse 3:)
(Celph Titled) Yo, this is for my niggas smoking chronic in blunts
(L-Fudge) For my my British niggas smoking spliffs along with silk, hunh?
(Celph Titled) For my European niggas smoking ounces of skunk
(L-Fudge) To my Dominican's making thousands off of just one
(Celph Titled) We can make songs for you, shit, why the fuck not
(L-Fudge) I take the first hit, hide it from cops, cops see, don't they paid to be dope, I'm addicted to bitches that give me brains to elope, but I'm tied up like Rudolph on a sleigh to a rope and cut up short like a movie to a dope
(Celph Titled) I'm an ungrateful asshole who's always quick to wet cops, have my t-shirts made in a third world sweat shop
(L-Fudge) You should have some sympathy
(Celph Titled) Well how could I have that? When I was 12, I was homeless and living with the rats
(L-Fudge) It's L-Fudge and Celph Titled we be NY's best, coming four times magnum, straight to your chest, what
