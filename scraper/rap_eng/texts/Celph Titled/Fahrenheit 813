(Intro: Celph Titled)

What we’ve come across here is something
That most of y’all don’t know about
So if we promise to let you know what the deal is
Y’all got to promise to listen

(Chorus: Majik Most)
Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo
Check that degree
Check that degree
Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo, yo
Check that degee
Check that degree
Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo, yo
Check that degee
Check that degree
Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo
Check that degee
Check that degree

(Verse 1: Dutchmasive)
Area code, octo uno tri Faherenheit
Swamp land, palm trees subparadise
No need for subways, we roam the city bus
Biodome a building block, walkmans are a must
I thrust attached to the back of a determined reptilian
Mad as fuck always dissing Floridians
Flood water is serious, snap the neck of most tourists
The vocals from a tropic state emcee can be poisonous
Avoid the underground railroad at 88.5
Or F-L-A hip hop broken down in the hive
I’m a strive making water aqua district you abused in
Not every southern melody you hear is booty music
I’m a run through shit, yo, Bay sound record my voice
I’m a be an Everglades emcee, I have no choice
Fuck a coast, Dutchmassive represent where alias
My residency is TPA, it’s like society of intelligence

(Chorus: Majik Most)
Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo
Check that degree
Check that degree
Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo, yo
Check that degee
Check that degree
Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo, yo
Check that degee
Check that degree
Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo
Check that degee
Check that degree

(Verse 2: Majik Most)
As I spit the prefix, all eyes transfixed
To the first tribe with archives
Advisers step up, amped up
Focused on my abnormal growth
Progression progression as hip hop moves on
Medal back support placed for torque
I stand strong through the Farenheits
Majik Most grabs the mic
Reveal my inner talent
Reign violent in your sector
Perfecter of the sound
Projects visions legendary
I carry the devastation to your face
In the place to be, my city represents me
The most elevated, but located below sea level
Uplifted peninsula, swung from east to west
Strike the country with humidity, swiftly
Sweaty back bastard from the 8-1-3
Emcee or monstrosities
Blasting adrenalin while Cramtroniks
Backspins with four arms
Emerging from his abdomen

(Chorus: Majik Most)
Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo
Check that degree
Check that degree
Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo, yo
Check that degee
Check that degree
Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo, yo
Check that degee
Check that degree
Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo
Check that degee
Check that degree

(Verse 3: Unknown [Not Celph])
I de-grit my teeth and rip my chords at sound receivers
Make sure I shine for stage perceivers
Make doubting niggas become believers
Create an irreversible friction without holding heat
Packing a 44 centimeter blade in liquid concrete
Silent, suffocate off of the salt water concentrate
Of this whole tropic state
I’m inclined with 8 hundred and 13 sonic calisthenics
Magnificently harmonistic in this song
That since we fixed, asphyxiation
Construct 50 foot needles on every building top
So all you big timers can never sleep on Tampa hip hop
Foundations get broken as my language is spoken
Bet you can take that as a token, when I get you open
I.E. the next time you hear the vibrations
Within my voice box, the game plan is Cyclops
Only one way that you can see me
Reincarnating, try your best of being me
Equilibrium’s the balance of the mind
And silence of divine
