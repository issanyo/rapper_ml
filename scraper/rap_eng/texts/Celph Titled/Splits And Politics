[Verse 1: Ruste Juxx]
Mic check one, two no feedback
I bust raps still flippin' on G packs
Three stacks per bar
Cause I'm the illest MC that you heard thus far
I got a nine wit' a rubber grip
You talk shit I let six rip to your upper lip
Many lives will be lost this year
Went from employee to a boss this year
Fuckin' judge try to throw that book
Snitch pointin' all at me like he know that crook, shit
I ain't do what you can't prove a thing, ah
Rap is the stage and Rick Rude the great
The tool that I bring is not for light work
Heavy arms when I'm layin' down pipe work
Bars come equipped for the rumble
Got the world in my grip finna crumble

[Scratch Hook]
"No offense to a player but yo I don't play"
"The game is just a game of splits and politics"
"Cause I don't have the time to sweat what someone else is doin'"

[Verse 2: Baby Blak]
Make 'em walk the plank like a Viking on a pirate ship
One knife, one mask, on that Michael Meyers shit
Stomp a nigga to the Timbaland tune
Just wear the Timberland and throw the vinegar in the wound
[?] straight to your mother door
Bounce off the floor knock your lil' brother off the hoverboard
Take ya money from the chump like a cover charge
Same time e'ry fuckin' day all summer long
Scored the K and the MAC, just murk ya
My niggas work the blade like a plastic surgeon
Yeah, clappin' iron on the rapid fire
No beef, all cheese like an appetizer
You niggas actin' bitch like bitches that can't see ya
Sweatshirts look like they spilled pitchers of sangria
Fuck around, shoot five for my fuckin' respect
Make 'em Duck Down like Dru Ha was cuttin' a check

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
Yeah, I'ma start at your Starter cap
You'll be the first down in ya first down in my .50 Cal automat'
You don't want all of that, not a lil' of this
It's all shits and giggles, bitch turn you to Kibbles & Bits
Flip the script, chomp down with an overbite
I'm like a stage light shinin' hover over mics
I left arts and crafts for plenty guns drawn
You said you got classics but we talkin' one song
Exposed at ya listening party
Ain't pickin' up hotties, you like body builders with glistening bodies
Yo, they had to stop right there cause you had guys and men on ya iPod skin
When I spray, it'll put some acne on ya
Looks like an Iraqi soldier
And when I popped up, you choked on ya blunt said, "God help me."
Then you swallowed ya weed and got left wit' a pot belly
