(Intro: The1shanti)

Yeah, that's right
You know what I mean
Bombay Safire, the India Bambaataa
Ain't no underground shit right here
Ay, yo, Electro, bring in the drums son
It's like niggas see your mug up on TV
And they think shits sweet, right
You know what I mean
Do a couple of major label tours
And shit ain't sweet
Ay, yo, Celph Titled
Talk to these mother fuckers

(Verse 1: Celph Titled)
Look down the barrel mother fucker
You can see what hell look like
I ain't never rock a halo
I grow horns from my head at midnight
My whole steeze consists of anger management release
Act like a baby and get dropped right on your head piece
This flow is deadly faggot, fuck, what you stupid
Oppose me and have you running
From an angry mob of Cubans
I'm a cross between Bram Stoker and La Cosa Nostra
We organized vampires with a chrome attire
This ain't no tough talk, it's words from a genius
You could me the meanest thug
I'll still have homicide cleaning your rug
Drinking the dick syrup, you bitches is intoxicated
I never use a rubber ma, my Glocks are chrome plated
Up in the studio, my masters rest in an alter
We keep a holy dress code, my engineers wear priest collars
Duck from the fire spray, this is how we making hits
I love the taste of burnt flesh, it tastes like bacon bits

(Verse 2: The1shanti)
I know you seen us in those videos (Right)
And heard our voice on the radio (True that)
With all of the pretty faces, check the phrasing
We keep it moving, Cuban to Asian
In this game, it's either me or you star
I ain't come up like Harold and Kumar
More like that kid who's counting them blue cars
Fucks with mines, you'll be calling on Blue Cross
Aspiring, I take it one step higher than
I stay trail blazing, they bootleg firemen
Conspiring, thinking of me retiring
You in too deep, now you wrestling leviathan
Deny a man from getting paid right
You all perspiring because you a bunch of playwrights
Stay tight with family, don't need friends kid
When I said 90 percent nigga I meant it
Some man shit, this is my school, y'all suspended
Never missing a day of the hustle, perfect attendance
Liquor a blend with to make your head spin
With electro-four yo, that nigga president

(Outro: The1shanti)

I know you seen us in those videos (True)
And heard our voice on the radio (Right)
With all of the pretty faces, check the phrasing
We keep it moving, Cuban to Asian
It's like mother fuckers see your mug up on MTV
And shit and think shit's sweet all the sudden
Y'all ain't grinding on the levels we've been grinding at
Mother fucking assholes
Trying to take away a little bit of shine
Because we've been grinding a decade and then some
Put in your time and then talk the shit
Do your homework
Before you talk to the mother fucking professors
Celph mother fucking Titled
Mother fucking 1shanti
Electro mother fucking four
Do the research
