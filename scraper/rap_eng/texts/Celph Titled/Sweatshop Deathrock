[Verse One: Virtuoso]
Black Sabbath, grey skies and white noise
Purple kush, green flags, raps sick as typhoid
Coat of chrome poems stone columns in Rome
Shroom gold Platoon director Oliver Stone
Lecture
Mister preacher with religious fever
I'm Hell bent on repenting do a sentence for you disbelievers
And I ain't saying I'm a Christian either
I'm eating Mystic Pizza
With some pistol squeezers while we twisting reefer
No Nastradamus but I'm spitting Ether
I reappear twice a year the crowds will cheer, [?]
Gripper feature, beat the track into a fetal positions
Send a kite through the mic to my people in prison
We have arisen, true and living, lucid vision, fuck Lucifer's superstition
I'm shooting the ruger piston this is
Malaysian sweatshop death rock hip hop
From the home of shell top Adidas and Red Sox and it don't stop

"Front if you want kid, lay on your back" - Mobb Deep 'Shook Ones Pt. 2'
"Watch what the fuck you say and what you do" - Freddie Foxxx 'Stock In The Game'
"You're now rocking with the best"
"Y'all ready for this?"
"Aw yeah!"

[Verse Two: Esoteric]
I'm a tsunami you a light storm and you a gopher
I'm the site foreman you a puny human, I'm a Demigod touring
We a pack of werewolves at night forming in white Jordans
Focus on cream like Mike Torman
We show up late, pop bottles and celebrate
We all ball like a Tommy heist, the ref complaint
The rest will faint, tomahawk slam when I bless the paint
Talk about fake rappers well Eso' ain't
One of them
Gunning them just sonning them
Like the U.N.L.V. Rebels when I'm Running them
All your views don't amount to a hill of beans
I'm on a hill in the Bean, a killing machine with seven guillotines
In the illest scheme, let the blood spill in the ravine
How you a bench warmer yet you chilling with your team?
I'm the villainest supreme, pen a song, me and weak MC's get alone
Like Optimus and Megatron

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three: Celph Titled]
Bio pic's sadistic, even the credit's scary
It ain't your fault you're a faggot it's hereditary
Carpel tunnel from popping triggers
Blisters from C-4 singes, cataracts from flashing nozzles spitting
Army with me you can bet that
When we uppercut a fuck by the time they land they'll have jet lag
Caught you wired with a cord and a bug
And you can go to court as a thug missing a quart of your blood
Grenade grand daddy guy, your whole family die
Punch your granny in the eye, fuck if she handicap and blind
28 grams of raw in the pot
Added 60 grams of Inositol in the pot
One in the three, mo' money for me
Means more motherfucking bread to toss a few stacks on your head
As cold as it gets, Celph Titled the closest you get
To a demon in the flesh get your rosary split
