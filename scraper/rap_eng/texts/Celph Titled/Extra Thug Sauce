[Sample]

We done fucked up royally this time
You fucked up royally this time!
It's over for you

* laughter *

[Verse 1: Guttamouf]

Yeah, haha, we ain't nothing but psychotic motherfuckers in here
I'm an equal opportunity cap buster
White, Black, Spanish, it don’t matter
Sixteen make you cough up your gall bladder
Even if you a bitch, it means no different
It doesn’t matter if you wear bullet resistant
I smack motherfuckers and leave barrel imprints
I represent the mentally, unstable
Who usually end up dead, or in jail
While you get your coffee, George Cheeba get lunch with Lucifer
Had breakfast with the grim reaper
Treat your body to a lead diet
If you don't, shut the fuck up and be quiet
I'm God's gift to your motherfucking photo
Spit on your photo, shit on your promo
With me, running around, get a bullet proof do-rag
Portable IV and a mother fucking shit bag

[Hook: Celph Titled]

Pull out the heat, it's about to get dirty
No more rap shit, just heavy artillery
We the type of niggas that's quick to blow your mug off
Serving motherfuckers beat downs with extra thug sauce

Pull out the heat, it's about to get dirty
No more rap shit, just heavy artillery
We the type of niggas that’s quick to blow your mug off
Serving motherfuckers beat downs with extra thug sauce

[Verse 2: Majik Most]

Ay yo, I'm coming to your city and I'll probably be
Rolling with a posse, that will eat a homeless woman's pussy
While playing Pavarotti they’ll be fishing your body
Out of Lake Erie in Michigan

With a Michelin tire wrapped around your midsection
I'm stepping on your corpse with a quart of your blood
All over my corduroys
While I bring the noise and strychnine and poison
Yeah, the type of shit I spit will leave you hollow inside

So motherfuck rap cats who can't get live:
I'm kicking hardcore lyrics till the age of 85
Until I retire, I'm only getting nicer
I'll slam your fucking face down on a deli slicer

You're crazy shook, rocking a Kevlar vest
A bullet took your head off and left a little piece of your neck
I need respect, I'm taking shit higher
Make you firearm backfire and light your arm on fire

... You stupid bitch

[Hook: Celph Titled]

Pull out the heat, it's about to get dirty
No more rap shit, just heavy artillery
We the type of niggas that's quick to blow your mug off
Serving motherfuckers beat downs with extra thug sauce

Pull out the heat, it's about to get dirty
No more rap shit, just heavy artillery
We the type of niggas that’s quick to blow your mug off
Serving motherfuckers beat downs with extra thug sauce

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]

Watch how I run through your clique
And straight kill every homeboy
Y'all niggas softer than the Pillsbury doughboy
Fucking faggot, you eat dick nuggets and love it
Watching a Richard Simmons tape
And jack off after you dub it

Celph Titled is known to leave heads severally bleeding
And keep crack heads on my block fiending

If your rhymes are poisonous, I’ll make you eat your words
My gun talk money, imagine all the heat you could earn

Record a joint with me featuring you getting beat the fuck up
In a sound booth with a busted mics in front of your fucking wife

Rocking prosthetic limbs, your crew copped the bootleg;
Call the police, you all shook daddy, nigga we two feds

Ain't another spic realer than me
I give a fuck about hip hop, I'm just in it for cheese
And if this music don’t work, I’ll just find another hustle;
You probably hate me for saying that shit so I say "fuck you!"

I kick rhymes on mad records just cause I can
You wish to spit bars on vinyl, but you'll never have fans
By the time you get a chance to have your first single out
My discography is countless, with six figure amounts

The God Celph Titled, contested by no one
Niggas want to bring it, you can catch me at a show, dun
Fuck that, son who, gun you
Look what I done to, young crews that tried to come through

Niggas owe me loot, they turn up floatin' like rafts and canoes
I'm laughing at dude for thinking he as raw as my crew
From the NY boroughs and alleys to Hillsborough County
My name ring bells like free phone sex rallies

The Rubix Cuban, unsolvable
Shoot out the voice box of emcees and leave them inaudible
An entrepreneur, your crew rocking my line of body bags
In the Chrome Depot, we got shopping bags full of gats

[Hook: Celph Titled]

Pull out the heat, it's about to get dirty
No more rap shit, just heavy artillery
We the type of niggas that's quick to blow your mug off
Serving motherfuckers beat downs with extra thug sauce

Pull out the heat, it's about to get dirty
No more rap shit, just heavy artillery
We the type of niggas that’s quick to blow your mug off
Serving motherfuckers beat downs with extra thug sauce
