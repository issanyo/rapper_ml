[Chorus]
Shots fired
Main dam
Got the barrel smokin’ from a hundred candy grams
I can smell murder
I can taste homicide
I can hear the sound of your momma cry
Shots fired, shots fired
Empty the clip man its shots fired
Shots fired, shots fired
Swiss cheese yah boy anytime its shots fired

[Verse 1]
All I know is keep it 100
Buck 50 under the tongue confront confrontation and never run
All of my shooters use tools to make metallic measures
Leave rappers leanin’ to the side like italic letters
If you think we drop dog shit, you droppin’ kitty litter
Yall sip wine coolers, over hear we itty zippers
No need to cop a convertible of the lot
I’ll finance the p89 and take off your topic
I made a dead statement when I made lead placements
You gave the prosecutors case a facelift, and gave the feds statements
That’s why your brains in the living room
Your legs in your backyard
I made it look like suicide and blamed it on bath salts
Got the fish scale like long johns
I fill your lungs with water like you hit the bong wrong
And its all when I say this ratchet of mine
Will have you dancing round the fire like an African tribe

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I eat competition and I eat the plate
Drum machine loop in my Louie luggage
Yeah I beat the case
Anybody and everybody that guided me before knows by now that my dichotomy is raw
The contradiction of peace when I feel like Shaquil
When I look at money cross eyed I feel like Shaquil
Im your mouth I bet you didn’t know this gat I was holdin’
Cause if you didn’t work it put caps on your molars
Im from an insane asylum, a gun range island
In advance im writin’ your obituary column
Solemly certified in this game i'm positionin’ my goons sign up but they ain't potitionin’
Im grizzly but ill still send wolves to getcha
And if they can't get the job done then fuck it ill pull the trigger
No beta version you just left with your guts out
Your corpse filled with roaches still tryin to work the bugs out
[Chorus]
