[Verse One] [Apathy]:
Demigodz is world wide, but I'm straight out of Connecticut
Flow's futuristic like it's made out of synthetic shit
Used to date this girl now I'm breaking up and deading it
Had to ditch that bitch to make out with a better chick
You don't know about Hell unless you walk through it
Can't recognize the devil's face unless you talk to it
And I'm very well acquainted my soul is tainted
Got that Van Gogh flow when my pain is painted
Wise beyond my years so my age is ancient
Love dirty hip hop that gets made in a basement
Fuck a pretty clean studio, my pop screen pantyhose
I've been through fucked up times that only my family knows
I'd love to be political and say no to fascists
But rather be superficial and say no to fat chicks
Disintegrate your favorite rappers to ashes
I'm tryin' to dress fly 'til society's cashless
A Magnum in my pocket lotta money in my wallet
Nike box wall to wall, I'm a freaking sneakaholic
And I cut your guts and remove your bowels
Ap's the principal in the school for scoundrels

[Hook]
Class is in session, throw in the towels
You gotta a late pass?
(You're in the school for scoundrels)
Knock out your teeth can't pronounce your vowels
Taught to act foul
(You're in the school for scoundrels)

[Celph Titled]:
Put the Demigodz in your cd player
Look at the cover tell your man
"Yo you see these players?"
Should have known from the start your whole crew is fake
I watched your video and thought I saw a blooper tape
Don't matter if you a boxer, you should see the way my ox cut
Put you in a box, rockin' a tux and close the top up
This show ain't over till the guitar smashed
Vision cloudy blowin' smoke from cigar blast
I'm a bizarre chap, Don CeSar of this rap
My reality show will make you retards clap
So get back, I'm back at it
The best form of flattery is steam rollin' you faggots
I fucked this fat bitch in the bathtub with musty arm pits
Blew the pussy out the water bitch said I had the bomb dick
I'm bipolar when I'm flexing anger
At the crib, laughing watching Chuck Norris Texas Ranger
I saw the angel of death at KFC
And said "Order me some wings
What I mean is put me on your team."
Stop fronting
I put in work when I pop something
Send them to the depths of hell
With one push of the Glock button

[Hook]
