Working to the bone
Never call me plain
It hurts every muscle
Commitment lives inside these veins

Don't understand my mind
I don't expect you to
I wanna apologise for everything
I've had to do

I'll bring the powers here to stay
Bring all the badness without a shame
Just climb the mountain and make it rain
I bring the heat, I rule the game

I'll bring the powers here to stay
Bring all the badness without a shame
Just climb the mountain and make it rain
I bring the heat, I rule the game

It's rap's next plateau, asshole, hijack with my mask low
Attack with accurate aim and tag toes
Became a capo in seventh grade
Left seven grenades with one pin missin' in ya grandma's kitchen
The raw edition, whenever I start writin'
One flick of my wrist, the tip of my pen sparks lightning
I'm a rapper's rapper's rapper
So pop ya Cris, spark ya sess the Loch Ness monster's flow has been captured

Matchin' verbs with exclamation, no herbs in my congregation
We discipline 'em and send missiles in if you not behavin'
(I will) strike a match and let the flames in
Call me insane when, I'm just makin' light of ya situation
No vote of confidence, no slow flow when I'm rhymin' it's
Rapid fire, murderous, described as a disturbin' fuck
(Yes sir) that I is
You can call me Dracula around bitches cause they bat eye lids
