[Celph Titled]
Hahahaha. Another Celph Titled motherfuckin' banger. Bllllllaaaaawww!

[Hook: Truth Enola]
Oh baby here I am
What you see is what you get
And you ain't seen nothin' yet
Oh baby here I am
Make money money
Take money money
Oh baby here I am
Be me, stay me, fuck them
Oh baby here I am
You can cough on it but don't puff on it

[Verse One]
Sometimes
You might catch me chillin'
In a candy on dub, pimped out Expedition
That ain't mine
You might catch me holdin'
200 grand in my hand
And in the ice I'm rollin'
Know I'm lyin'
But you can catch me in the club
With no bottle of bub just Henny Royaled up
More like mine
Style
Get the party wild
Spread love
Bless man, woman and child
I'm surprised I'm still here
The shit I endured
Dream sellin' frauds
Coked out broads
At least I can say I turned this mother out
While y'all bitches doin' the jealous craze is all about

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
I don't like V.I.P
People too nice to me
Givin' fucked up advice to me
Shiesty
Soon to put a knife to me
Then see me advance
Like crabs in a barrel
Tryin' to hold you back with a clamp
Hate to see another man
Get some place that you can't
Same motherfuckers fillin' your gas tank with sand
Sayin', "You my fam, my dog"
Soon you start rushin' 'em
Sign the dotted line
And givin' you your publishin'
And no shows
No hoes and no doe
Then, fuck it, I'll go back to the circle and sell coke
I don't brown nose
Kiss ass or cop out
There ain't no dope
That'll make me nod out
Told you
Enola
Beginnin' to end
Mad Men
New York to Cali like Juice & Gin
Turn heads, drop jaws when we walk in the door
Monstrous
Mute out the world
You know the law it's like...

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Honestly, remain truth lyrical counselor
Are you men-tal enough to endure?
Soar with the powerful flight
The fight of a lion's world
Move with the mind's successful entrepreneur
Or exist no more
Either or either way
Cradle to the grave
Monstrous every day
I ain't change
Still go to the clubs
Hittin' the bar
Soul in my art
Hopin' the Lord see to my heart
Still the same
Changin' the stars
Pullin' the cards
Doin' my thang
Ridin' thru the Mad Man Moss
Remember the name
No artificial shit
True blue motherfuckers
What you see is what you get

[Hook]

[Outro]
It go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
If your bitch start actin' up then you take her friend
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
Tryin' not to haha
Monstarous
