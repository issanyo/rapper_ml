[Intro]
Uh. Celph Titled. The ammunition magician. Mad Ammo Godzilla General

[Verse]
Coming down your block in the A-Team van
You want a 16 from me, you better pay me man
(80 Grand?)
Beauty salon nightmare, I'll split a wig
When it's pain, it's mo' than a little bit
Like Raymond James I had cannon's in Tampa
Drawing out blueprints in pamphlets when I had plans to
Poison you with chloride and 409
This is before '09
I had 4-0 nines
And they all had their fair share of poppin' off
Blow out a candle?
Nah, this shit's blowin' the whole topping off
You made front page with your wack name
So you put it in a glass frame
And since you act lame, I'm grabbing it off wall
And what I'ma do to you
Is smash it over your head to break the news to you
Act like a female get smacked like a female
Matter of fact, might get smacked by a female
Ask for breakfast in bed, I'm blammin' the toast
Slammed on the stove, pantyhose jammed in your throat
A true stocking stuffer, a real ass motherfucker
Certified chopper buster
I'ma let off a couple
DJBooth.net puttin' up my links quick
Spread it out like zoo monkeys that fling shit
Won't play fair
I'll have lightening strike you everywhere
Leave you with that George Clooney grey hair
You're tryin' to put on a track that your man made
Better hope that he's really better at putting on band aids
Do I mandate, regulate, damn straight
At a table with bosses, eating lamb steak
Competition's not a bit manly
You're clique members is soft as Pez dispensers that spit candy
So anyone that wanna beef with me
Might get a chance to meet Curtis but won't live to see 50

[Hook] {x2}
Y'all askin' "Who got next?"
Better grab Glocks and tec's cause you gettin' shot next
Celph Titled on DJbooth.net
And because you ain't been shot yet doesn't mean my raps won't pop vests
Still askin' "Who got next?"
Still got Glocks and tec's still you gettin' shot next
Celph Titled on DJbooth.net
So you get shot (yes)
I guess my raps stop breath
