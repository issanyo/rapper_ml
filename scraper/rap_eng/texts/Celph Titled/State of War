[Intro]
There's a state of war that exists...and that is something else. It's a state of war that men brought on themselves. And right now lets go to take a look at the state of war that now exists

[Verse One: Celph Titled]
I laugh when you were shot, I think the bullet hole's adorable
I'll throw a zombie theme party at your memorial
Wet balloon fight at your wake and when the boy toss
I keep 'em guessing it's either toilet water or soy sauce
First heard you name, I researched that shit
One Google search, it just said "faggot"
Y'all might have a nine to five
But I put a nine to five fakes and burn them to the texture of a rice cake
They sit in front of the TV with the clicker
They ain't even remotely hard so no regard when I pull triggers
Let's begin when I stretch skin
And make a trampoline to span from the east side to the west end
I'll cook up the formula in my laboratory
Next level bomb technology of unknown category
The blast will launch your body parts to Neverland
They probably won't never land, maybe just a severed hand

[Verse Two: Esoteric]
I spit it so rugged with it the critics will love it
Haters try to one up it, the flow is warm I can't touch it
I'm crashing self and smashing pornographic actress pelvis
Elvis in the building chilling
In a Galactus helmet fucking
Then give the new wave a budget
Fans take the Kool-Aid and chug it
They drink it up oh man you factoring rubbish
Shifty rappers we handi clap fifty rounds of the filthiest
Pound for pound we the guiltiest
The way you sound is the silliest
Willy nilly you're killing us with that shit you ain't villainous
Real recognize real like we got the red pill in us
We've been doing this since EPMD put that Chill in us
Change the game and we will adjust
Trust me man it was built for us
You can't censor or filter us
Motherfuck what your man says
We got peeps that will kill for us unlike Aaron Hernandez
I take a dad in the Sable playing Cats In The Cradle and play him this
He'll go home and put an ax through the table
Acting unstable cause I'm crazy and mentally ill
Lock him in Arkham Asylum wilin' on Amityville
Rambo and ammo to kill
Polo and camo to chill
Solo and manage to still
Damage an amateur kid's grill

[Outro]
I will take no prisoners. I will...not surrender. I will...terminate Star Barbarian Jones The Butcher! This is valiance war!
