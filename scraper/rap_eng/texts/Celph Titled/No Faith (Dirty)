Rise - “No Faith”
[Emcee(s): Rise]
[Producer(s): Celph Titled]

[Intro: Rise]
It’s cool.  Y’all ain’t believe I could do it.  It’s cool

[Verse 1: Rise]
Abusing the mic.  Rhymes?  Wrote a few in the night
Knowing my team’s special like we due in the Hype
But due to the price of fame and economical limits
My wallet has nothing but ID’s and receipts in it
Started to fiend, Rise the artist in Jean
There’s two types of bills, I had the ones that aren’t green
‘Cause when you’re a new act in the back of the scene
Starting off, you get treated like Jack with the bean
Your dreams tossed out the window, they question why you choose it
But if you beat the odds, they all knew you could do it
Bad advice hurts like a jagged knife poked in your spine
Dipped in salt and rusted after soaking in limes
Most of the time, there’s eyes in the back of my head
‘Cause people falling off on their way and grabbing your leg
Battle for bread ‘til you dead, stress harden my face
Take over this huge planet, just a marble in space

[Hook: Rise]
They said I couldn’t do it, I was wasting my time
And now they’re early to the shows, sleeping in line
And can’t wait ‘til I rhyme, so I can scream and they cheer it
But sorry, y’all, it’s too late, I don’t want to hear it
They said I couldn’t do it, ain’t believed in my shit
Now they beep in my hip and want to be on the list
People are trips.  Slept, now they’re screaming and cheering
But it’s too late, I don’t want to hear ‘em

[Verse 2: Rise]
I couldn’t take it anymore, my songs not in any stores
Broke, it’s a joke to be poor, needed a penny more
Paying dues with IOU’s, I need another job
Screening phone calls, lying to Discover Cards
When they call, I ain’t paid them in months, they sound upset
But they don’t know my voice, so I tell them that I just left
An everyday struggle, the fight of my life
It’s like I got the dynamite, but got to fight for the light
So I keep it moving, but never let the dust settle
‘Cause rappers nowadays make me want to switch to metal
I hate the rotation, the stations are all fools
I only listen to tapes, Jazz, and Old School
I’ma blow if it kills you, but they’ll hold the checks
It’s not who flows the best, it’s about your rolodex
So I’ll flow to wreck and I don’t get so upset
Because I know I’m loved by millions, but they don’t know it yet

[Hook: Rise]
They said I couldn’t do it, I was wasting my time
And now they’re early to the shows, sleeping in line
And can’t wait ‘til I rhyme, so I can scream and they cheer it
But sorry, y’all, it’s too late, I don’t want to hear it
They said I couldn’t do it, ain’t believed in my shit
Now they beep in my hip and want to be on the list
People are trips.  Slept, now they’re screaming and cheering
But it’s too late, I don’t want to hear ‘em

[Verse 3: Rise]
And peace to my fam for understanding my ways
And realizing that this rap thing is more than a faze
I worked on nothing but my music, and there had to be days
When they thought I’m chilling, like the bills are magically paid
At night, when I laid, sometimes I just wished for a change
Wanted to elevate, got helped in picking my name
I been slept on, on the climb, but I still rhyme
Who’s the victim in the crime if I try to kill time?
Suicide, who could rise without going back down?
To levels where dropped pennies pierce a hole in the ground
Rocking the best ‘til the doc shocking my chest
See, fucking with this rap shit, I got it to death
And they say you’re working best as an artist when you’re hungry
Some dope niggas made some money and got comfy
The dopest is Rise.  Who’s left scoping these guys?
Axis 36, so open your eyes
