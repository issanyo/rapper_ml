[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
Haunted by the opticals
Exhibiting the man within myself
Parallel vision with no mirror in my possession
Seek help with this this digression, Consciously aware
A piece of human kind specifically designed for serving Jehovah
The hope for peace is over
The future correlates to actions executing themselves presently to the third degree
To the maximum the year one comma nine nine eight
Nuclear explosion buttons are controlling my fate
Hallucinate myself behind bars
There's nothing I can do
Watch my brother self-destruct, affected with eternal flu
Technology advances advanced into potential danger
Government officials soon seek employment at the 18th hanger
Question the theory that one person makes a change
Stand up for your beliefs or all perceptions stay the same
From now until then, most people play the back seat
In this atmospherical taxi without paying fee
The problem's persistence is guided by the flesh existence
Look at my hands I realize just exactly who I am
Sin was always here when will it ever go away?
The answer to that question comes with Judgment Day

[Hook: Equilibrium]
If our lives were a novel this could be the last edition
Realize what you're doing start to make the right decision
If you're seeking trouble time to change your position
Our generation can't survive in critical condition
Critical condition
What's the status? Bout to put you in conditions, that's critical!
Critical condition
What's the status? Bout to put you in conditions, that's critical!

[Verse 2: Vex]
My voice travels miles from the middle east of Florida
Toward the vital information through your corridor
The New World Order the ill plot to lock blocks
And watch the poor on they monitors resort to selling rocks
Society's the pyramid on the back of the dollar
Minorities the bottom rung, the middle rung is the scholars
Moving up in the degrees in masonic fraternities
Like the order of beliefs representing the beast
Infantries infiltrating they every wicked move
With reconnaissance tactics that be locking the groove
A record, so you can check it, respect it and know the truth
Babylon's a whore, I fight this war with proof
For black youth who ain't free but just emancipated
Like fifty percent of brothers in DC incarcerated
Still, we can be faded, that's why America's so jaded
Change the whole frame of the game and how they played it
But we get assassinated by press like OJ
But when Clinton page whores and wage wars, it's ok
I break these lines of defense like sports and take no shorts
When I'm out in the streets or approaching the bench in circuit courts
My battles are fought, the narrow path is sought
Yo, my soldiers bring the wrath of God and can't be bought
If you brought KKK and the pope, you couldn't enslave the voice
That collapsed the matron to an enclave
I dropped a jewel and save the pearl from the swine
Corrupt they minds, keeping this jam shining they nines
Powerless cause power refines, you gained spine
Catch a house arrest anklet, tracked by GPS
Your information and location get beamed to satellites
You thought you was general, but you can't battle right
Take my advice or wise up on your mission
Hot metal can't change the ghetto's critical condition

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dutchmassive]
The organic cyborg evolved from a tape deck
Dastardly form the glass sphere with no concept
Ironic, I was created from Jenova's project
Outcast into the shadows, a city without logic
Peeking out sewer drains, I learned from society
So half humanoids is mutant past they rioting
Vital information journalists remain silent
Saturday morning cartoons consist of sins and acts of violence
Now I'm violent, bringing up file "Attack Mode"
I have cloned human vortex to avoid a barcode
Conditions for the future are decided through the present
Indefinite, through genetics, I was raised to be intrepid
Forget utopia, junk planet is my reality
I used to dream about life as a peaceful art gallery
Top secret ways of living, citizens controlled by hard drive
Lies covered by government to androids with snake eyes

[Verse 4: Majik Most]
I walk the earth in contemplation
While men fall victim to self-inflicted mutations
I'm saddened by this cycle
Of never ending wickedness and ignorance
The nation stays unconscious, I call upon the savior
Falling into God's arms is critical to explore your spiritual
Side if you collide with this final judgment day
Past the next millennium, material objects become like dust in the wind
See, you trapped in a fantasy, unaware your body is temporary
A housing for the soul control your destiny through righteous steps know yourself
The future now unfaded, never definite
It lies in the palms of this next generation
But will it be infected with the same rotation
Of evil actions, society is full of sin and stagnant
I fight against the system and pass on the wisdom
You can't disrupt these sevens the mind stays divine forever placed among the heavens
