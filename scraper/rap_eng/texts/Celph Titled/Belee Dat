[VERSE 1: Celph Title]
Somebody must have let the gorillas out
But it be Godzilla season
So the GodZ pledge allegiance
I’ve fled the scenes with thieves and
You jetted home with a grievance
Left your Polo shirt sleeveless

Boy scout rookies can’t out jook me
So I cook flounder on my couch
And keep an outlook where the crooks be
Same old chorus - but hook 3 (wake up bake up bread)
Amplify my gunshots loud enough to wake (the dead)
No it ain’t no luggage I’m on an ego trip
Bird feather collector - give you an eagle clip
If you got probably cause
I’ll wrap your noggin with gauze
It’s 47 ways to show you what the chopper’s for
They’ll have to mop up the floor
To find your wig piece - bones out in bubble fuck
Brain’s out in shit’s creek
Ain’t nothing suck about DemigodZ we all that
So when they ask if we rock say Belee Dat

[Chorus]
Belee Dat
Belee Dat
Belee Dat
Belee Dat

[VERSE 2]
Open up your grill - I’m closing the taco truck
My Glock go buck - yours - not so much
I repent for my sins - and pray for the best tho
Iced out Jesus piece - still give me a chest cold
You was trained in a Safari - but you still duck
I just make a finger puppet
You think it’s some ill stuff
Like a gang gesture - but I don’t run with them
I aim better - so I don’t shoot guns with them
Drain the ocean for remains for crashed ships
Lump giving fat lips - love fucking fat chicks
Some fucking bad shit - back flip like Shinobi
Shot a poison tip dart to your fagot ass homie
Ratchet ass hoes blow me - I’m such a bad influence
I’m ignorant - Bermuda Triangle of lost innocence

Ain’t nothing suck about DemigodZ we all that
So when they ask if we rock say Belee Dat

[Chorus]
Belee Dat
Belee Dat
Belee Dat
Belee Dat
