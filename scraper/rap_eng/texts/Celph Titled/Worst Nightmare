[Verse 1: Apathy]
Mary mother of Christ, get crushed with a spike
I'm disgustin' on mics, suckas get their jugular sliced
Words spoken wise like a wizard puffin' on pipes
Get punched in a fight till windpipes ain't functionin' right
Fact is, all that paper you makin' is masonic
Pagan holidays you praise priests we're raised on it
Black flags raised I'm prayin' for Reganomics
Next album no features, just me and Satan on it

[Verse 2: Ryu]
Raisin' hell with the flava, nothin' can save ya
Tryin' to play me like an arcade homie I'm not a gamer
A worse nightmare since my momma went into labor
No pushin' I just cut myself out with a razor
Aye, do me a favor playa (what?)
You know my name, say it
Even Wolfgang call me the rap game's Amadeus
I ain't a skater but I stay on my grind duke
A nightmare to MC's, don't sleep on Ryu

[Verse 3: Blacastan]
Prime minister black, hold court like Law & Order
Blackmail the president, kidnappin' his daughters
Flyin' over the boarder, throwin' coke in the water
I laugh while runners come scoop it on hover crafts
Sultan camouflage float through the >fog/floor??<
Welcome to the black lodge this is espionage
Crystal ball vision
Diamond cut with precision
Black robes in a temple inventin' new religions

[Verse 4: Esoteric]
Ayo I'm killin' every mic, military strike
Tesseract power, best attract, now I fill up terabytes
Esoteric never bites, here I still bury Titans
You should bury what you write, I'm at Demigodzilla height
You ain't a gang you're a local group
Bunch of cats posin' with guns/Gunz like Lord Tariq at a photo shoot
Let me be real blunt
We roll deep like a B-Real blunt
Let them Primo drums thump

[Verse 5: Motive]
So I got these niggas buggin' cause they bitches stay sluttin'
Want me to swing wood at they face like Jim Duggan
Lyrical henchman from another dimension
Y'all niggas is puppets controlled by Jim Henson
I'm way beyond sick, motherfuckers I'm half dead
A veteran, I'm the medicine man for crack heads
Preme and the guys, unstoppable nigga
We raisin' the bar like at the gym spottin' a nigga

[Verse 6: Celph Titled]
My legions cause lesions
And no Hydrocortisone can repair the fact that you'se a marican
I put the "b" in bullet, I put the bullet in the "b" of your Beats By Dre
In stereo hear the ricochet
Ride with extendos
Got mistaken for throwin' gang signs
Flickin' boogers out my window
Let 'em fly your way
Make your flight hydroplane
Into an Everglade marsh that'll hide your plane
