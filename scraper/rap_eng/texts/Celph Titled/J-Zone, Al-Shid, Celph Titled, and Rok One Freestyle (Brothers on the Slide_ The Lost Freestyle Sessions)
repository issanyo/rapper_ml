[Intro: J-Zone]
Yo, Unknown, man.  Yo, I’m in this situation, man.  Yo, this girl said, “Yo, Zone, I want to be your friend.”  I was like, “Aight.”  But now I’m on the road again.  Yo

[Verse 1: J-Zone]
Yo, yo, I’m backed up like the deacon at five in the evening
Before a Yankee game with a crash in the left lane
I’m like the Belt Parkway from Coney Island festivals
Remain with a pain in the testicles (Uhhh!)
Yo, the fifth girl this month said she want to be platonic friends
My rap is void—even when she drunk off the tonic gin
Wasted fifty cents to reach her—took two calls
After all of that, blue balls.  Looking for
A way to release this nut, so for being
Backed up, I wrote a thesis: slut named Dawn
Got her period.  Damn, so does Jennifer.  Some cats
Pay for it to see it.  I refuse to do that
The money go to music so I'm steady staying blue, black
Painful platonic friendships with a woman
Got to ease the tension, so now I'm thumbing
Through the phonebook.  There goes June—look
Nah, high maintenance.  Damn, I can’t take this
Fuck running game.  Yo, I got to rent a flick
Fast.  Not a porno—hell nah
Lucy, Alexis booties—either with
A fist, getting sex, hitting two in the payback
Pass the Kleenex so I could wipe off the tip

[Interlude 1: J-Zone]
Hell yeah.  Every day to get ahead, dun.  Now I’m back to square one.  Every morning and every evening, the same shit.  (Yo, I can’t fuck with no more platonic friends, man.  That shit is painful, man).  No more platonic friendships (I’ma go in the bathroom and get busy though.  Word up)

[Interlude 2: Al-Shid and Samples with Scratches by DJ Unknown and DJ Mekalek]
[Samples with Scratches by DJ Unknown and DJ Mekalek]
“Oh.  You got to give me something now” - Sample from [?] - “[?]”
“Yeah” - Sample from [?] - “[?]”
[Al-Shid]
Yeah, yeah.  You know the name, yeah.  Know who the nigga be—Al-Shid this one right here creeping out.  Super fly style, turn this shit up.  Check me rotten and rhyming on this one when it’s done (Check)

[Verse 2: Al-Shid]
Even if I never sell a copy, I’ll still walk the streets
Hella cocky like, “Who the hell could stop me?”
[?] pants hanging slightly.  Not giving a fuck
Call my bluff and I’ll bring it to you with my crew
That’s top-speed, faster than bullets move after the
Glock squeeze, so ask yourself: how you gonna pop Shid?
Want to put the TEC to my neck and throw me the slugs?
(Nah) Only thing you’ll ever hold against me is a grudge
You ain’t got to show me to love ‘cause love is blind
But as long as a hater’s visible, I’ll continue the ritual
Of straight ripping you, keeping your family lighting visuals
Over you, calmly kissing you, crying because they’re missing you
It’s too late to listen to reason.  I’d rather have
The hospital shocking you because you’re missing your breathing
Should have let your true colors come through (Why?).  Playboys, just
Too much 2Pac and not enough you (Faggot bitch niggas)

[Hook: Samples with Scratches by DJ Unknown and DJ Mekalek]
“’Y’all niggas ain’t fucking with Shid’—topic of session” - Sample from [?] - “[?]” (x2)
"I do my own thing" - Sample from Rasco - "What It's All About" (x2)
"I do my own thing and don't need hoes to sing it" - Sample from Rasco - "What It's All About"

[Interlude 3: Celph Titled]
Uh.  What you want now?  What you want now?  Celph Titled.  Motherfucking DJ Unknown and Mek (That's right).  Feeding you assorted biscuits, hollow-tipped kiwi.  You know how I do.  Yo, check my ace boon coon cameo.  It goes something like this.  Hope y'all can dig this.  Yo, check it, check it, check it, check it

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
Yo, I’ll hold rappers hostage, spit saliva that's toxic
From the NYC to the FLA tropics
AR-15 schizo make your chest blow
Nothing to say like Greg Nice without the echo
I’m a cross between C4 and C-3PO
Explosive intelligence pack the heavy metal
Out the window.  With that demo that you're trying to sell me
I'd rather listen to a Rob Base comeback LP
It's not healthy for you to come around here with that
Run your mouth off like that, get your wig pushed back like that
I'll make you swallow the grenade and put an envelope
And stamp in your hand and mail the pen to Afghanistan
What I say makes sense in the mind frame I'm in
While you Babylon/babble on like the Mediterranean
Throw you down the escalator just to sterilize/stair-ilize you
Deranged doctor with the scalpel that slice through
Anyone who contests.  My clique hard as nails
It'll be a done/dun deal like Mobb Deep on sale
Escaped convict for putting out mob hits
You prolly a homo that shave your armpits
You ain't real.  You ain't seen the streets before
Hold the heat before, know what it's like not to eat before
When I speak words, I’ll make it clear to you
That what I do in a minute would take you a year to do

[Hook: Samples with Scratches by DJ Unknown and DJ Mekalek] (x2)
"Want to be hardcore but don't know what it is” - Sample from [?] - “[?]”
“To get paid in the streets or to really get biz" - Sample from [?] - “[?]”

[Interlude 4: Rok One]
Keep, keep it on.  You nah’m saying?  Rok One up on the microphone.  DJ Mek, DJ Unknown straight dropping gems on your dome.  My style is fully grown.  Go and get some shitty on.  Yo, yo, check it.  Fuck them

[Verse 4: Rok One]
Now what you see is
An emcee with a flow that’s buttery, fatter than gluttony
Suddenly stabbing your corny thought pattern with verbal cutlery
Leaving you ugly, my bloodily altered, call
For help, but there’s no visual signs of recovery
Stunningly, I’ll strike suddenly, holding the mic grudgingly
I’ll step on stage in holograph form—nobody’s touching me
Cunningly sonning these dumb emcees for confronting me
Hip hop icon faster than a Nikon shutter speed
Eliminating wack acts within my perimeter ‘cause sounding
Similar will get you steamrolled like Forest Whitaker
Spitting a flammable flow, I’ll laugh as you burn
You might be big, but I can squeeze your fucking ash in an urn
Now you and your crew can get tossed like a horseshoe.  This shit I drop-
-‘ll give your label second thoughts ‘bout wanting to endorse you
I’ll make your team lose the urge to support you.  Your mother wished
That she chose to abort you, the shadow wanted to box you
Dropping you down into morsels of bite-sized portions
Freezing foes like Hans Solo in a carbonite coffin
Dropping ‘em, topping ‘em, having ‘em gasping for oxygen
Brothers get no love on the mic—I’m cock-blocking ‘em
Knocking ‘em out of position like bowling pins with
A flow smoother than Poland Spring’s.  I’ll hold the strings
Like a rap puppet master, rushing past your crew, rolling in
Disowning kings.  Rok One, I’ll stay controlling things
