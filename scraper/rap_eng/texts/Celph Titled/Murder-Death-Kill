[Intro: Celph Titled]
Eso, what up son? you know how the fuck we do, motherfuckin Demigods
Motherfuckin Army of the Pharoahs
It's murder death kill playboy, ainno saftey's on
These microphones, ainno motherfuckin silencers for this shit
Cause when we hold 'em...
We let this shit go off right in they're fuckin face (let 'em know)

[Celph Titled]
I'm always gettin a suntan on my gun hand cuz I keep the burner out
Ready to blaze scorchin lead at your fam
So when I give you a pound, it's really 4
Cuz a 45. defies gravity, liftin you off of the floor
Pick out your coffin decor maybe some marble and gold
And hope they write some nice words when they carvin your stone
"here lies a noble man who got brave stuck out his chest bone"
Beef with Celph Titled now this grave is what he calls home
Get your gaul stone put in a jar in a lab
Even the coroner got sick and had to barf in a bag
Your boyfriend said you was a marvelous fag
And in drag thought you was God like the carpenters dad
You said I wasn't rippin shit properly?
The magnitude of my gangsta is a motherfuckin scientific anomoly
With a strange collection of weapons I got a good assortment
Come close and ima cut you with a mercedes hood ornament

[Bridge]
Yo, you talkin loud homeboy we never heard of you
Put your little record out, nobody never heard of you
Went to your city, and they said they never heard of you
So we usin motherfuckin bars of death to murder you

[Hook]

[Esoteric]
We beheadin your heroes steady&ready for eddie guerro
Theoretically your chance of deadin me zero
Give up your petty dinero..?
We medically and poetically my machete is ready
Me men don't need to coast the homie shows keep the gat close
? shove it down your throat, make you bite the iron man like you jackals
Bars of death connected like money fresh off the press
An old carcass left in the fetal position no people listen
Record spinnin but the needle is skippin
I never needed permission in sayin I don't believe in religion
I believe in peepin a lethal evil tradition
I believe in merkin enemies with precision feedin the fish ? G's in my vision
Your styles infintile seek out a pediatrician
It be another emcee missin on the evenin edition

[Bridge]
