[Intro:]
God-zilla, God-zilla, God-zilla, God-zilla
God-zilla, God-zilla, God-zilla, God-zilla
God-zilla, zilla, zilla, zilla

[Bridge:]
We stomp rappers like Godzilla, Godzilla
D-G-Z, M-O-P
We stomp rappers like Godzilla, Godzilla
Let’s go

[Chorus:]
Demigod killers
We stomp rappers like Godzilla, Godzilla (Uh, yeah)
Demigod killers
We stomp rappers like Godzilla, Godzilla (Y’all ready?)

[Verse 1: Apathy]
It's a highway to hell breakin' outta my cell
With the smell of gunpowder like a shotgun shell
The spell's spoken; I've awoken, crawlin' out from the ocean
Breathe fire approachin' you in a violent motion
Tried to kill the monster in me with a vial of potion
Devil went down to Georgia with his violin smokin'
Soakin' up the radiation, growin' eighty feet tall
Spike a fighter jet to the ground like a beach ball
Throw your body up in the sky, let it freefall
My freestyles hit your heart harder than speedballs
The bald eagle's all evil, watch what they teach y'all
The small people, called feeble, might just eat y'all
I'm Godzilla, vanilla gorilla, still a scary villain
Who carry weapons to kill and bury military
Fighter pilots start ejectin' from jets
When I eat up cassette decks like a pet T-rex

[Chorus:]
We stomp rappers like Godzilla, Godzilla
We stomp rappers like Godzilla, Godzilla
Demigod killers
We stomp rappers like Godzilla, Godzilla
Demigod killers
We stomp rappers like Godzilla, Godzilla

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
Somebody tell the President to wake up
It looks like there's a monster with my genetic makeup (ah)
I think a meteor was orbitin' Florida
Crash-landed through my door
And then I started absorbin' the sorta force
That would send a Transformer to the coroner (what)
To Earth I'm a foreigner (yeah), disperse their coordinates (uh)
'Til my missiles show up, you show up dead
I'll send you to a sleepover, on a blow-up bed (haha)
Look at me and you starin' at evil
Pity the fool; push him in a kiddie pool of used heroin needles (ah)
Holdin' two Tommy's I survived the Tsunami on a surf board (huh,huh,huh…)
Y'all scared to fight even if it's with Nerf swords
All these pussy motherfuckers been shook since
They started pullin' skeletons of rappers out my footprints (damn)
And four minutes later...
You got a forty-four floor story Florida Gator scalin' a skyscraper

[Chorus:]
We stomp rappers like Godzilla, Godzilla
We stomp rappers like Godzilla, Godzilla
Demigod killers
We stomp rappers like Godzilla, Godzilla
Demigod killers
We stomp rappers like Godzilla, Godzilla

[Verse 3: Lil Fame and Billy Danze]
No sleep till Brooklyn
Goddamn that boy beastie, my flow's too tough for T.V. (Gun Boy, fuck yeah)
I'm the buildin' but it's vacant, see I ain't got it all upstairs (It's in my [?])
Y'all need bodyguards I need none
Squeeze the juice out a rapper like a Capri Sun
Fucker, its Brownsville home of the blocka-blocka
Talkin' OG nigga, chop shot-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
Click, reload, then I'm ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka
Bros before hoes here, share these hoes with 'em
You decided to ride, come out the Ford wit 'em
Out the sunroof, woof go get 'em
I show you rap cats real battle rap, this is harder
We the hardest and we rattle rats, battle that
I'm where the trouble at, bring a couple stacks
Goin' 'nanas, leave a mess where your Nana tatted at

[Chorus:]
We stomp rappers like Godzilla, Godzilla
We stomp rappers like Godzilla, Godzilla
Demigod killers
We stomp rappers like Godzilla, Godzilla
Demigod killers
We stomp rappers like Godzilla, Godzilla

[Outro:]
Zilla, Zilla, Zilla, Zilla, Zilla, Zilla
God, God, God, God, God
God-zilla, God-zilla, God-zilla
God-zilla, God-zilla, God-zilla...

[Sample: [?] ]
"These monsters cannot be stopped."
