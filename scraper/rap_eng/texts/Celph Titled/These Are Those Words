"As my thoughts submerge, these are those words"
"I gets much too complex"

[Verse 1]
My cancellation plans cause lacerations and chop hands
Sometimes my Glock jams but my revolver do the Real Roxanne
I saw the ops they ran, knew that I would fade 'em quick
And yank 'em by the dress, bitch ass weirdos like Jaden Smith
I don't care if you like it or not
I write, recite and excite on the mic, I don't care if you like it, I'm hot
We extort extorters, escort daughters
Fuck wit' killers that snort quarters that's paranoid to cross boarders
Gun tucked in the holster right under the underarm
That toast make you consider which side you buttered on
So when I quote my price don't make me tell ya twice
When I go car shoppin' it's a helicopter price
Develop levels of stoppin' ya life til my rivals all dead
Make a brick of C4 bigger than Joe Biden's forehead
Last person that said Celph Titled ain't a gangsta he is
Hangin' from a ceilin' fan, rotatin' and danglin'

"Understand"
"I gets much too complex"
"Sorry to hear that"

[Verse 2]
If I ain't the man then who the fuck is?
If you eatin' snacks and make the Pringles duck lip
I'll smack ya mouth quick so you'll be coughin' bitch
And chips lodged dumb thick in your esophagous
Then I'm givin' dumb dick to your sloppy bitch
Put your head in a jar til it looks like pig's feet
With beef jerky meat, stamp an expiration date on your cheek
Remember Puff and them shiny suits? We rockin' that shit
With flame throwers, charcoaling ya troops
And I'm prone to shoot, do whatever the fuck to get my paper on
Yeah you got a gun but it's unloaded with the safety on
You get your on, stop, drop and roll when I pop the fo' fo' and leave a whole lot of holes
So fo' sho' I'm sendin' rappers to rehab
And put 'em on their kneecaps, sorta like a skeezer or a skeet rag
Think you got a career but you just carry his weed bag
Drop a tape but I'd rather listen to static and feedback
