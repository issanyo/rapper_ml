[Verse One] [Celph Titled]:
When you see me, hundred deep, black pound on me, fatigue
With that mad ammo emblem, showin' sharpened teeth
Yes I'm here for war and y'all are about to feel fire
From bullets the circumference of a power wheel tire
Show you the part of your brain you don't use
Results from a drive by I dip through your town I blow through
Fast as fuck in a NASCAR truck
Like it was sliding down a oil slick aqueduct
Out the window all you heard is clack clack buck
Smackin' up you wack ass fucks cause you wack as fuck and that's what's up
The mag will start burstin'
And when you hear it go, you'll turn blue like an Avatar person
9-11 attacks was civilians crashing into buildings
When I attack, I'm throwin' buildings down on civilians
Send the threat directly or you can call for back up
When the fo' fo' spray it's Chipotle beef, get wrapped up

[Scratch Hook]:
"Warfare"
"Bring your whole crew against me just to make it fair"
"Cause we belong in a Cage like Nicholas"
"Hungry like a third world country across the border"
"Competition"
"Lockin' lips with another man"
"Blast at you fag niggas without hair"
"Leave you in the fetal position, with your ass out" - Fat Joe
"Box with my fist still stuck in your mouth"

[Verse Two] [King Magnetic]:
The name's Magnetic
But not God Body
It's the new 50 Cent in Bizarre's body
Long shottie, wear heat like it's thermal wear
You only shootin' in the sky like you burnin' flares
Facin' so much time, my attorney's scared
From placin' bubbles on your head without perming hair
I'm permanent, I'm concerned with shit that a rapper do
Cause it's a scrap if I say that I wanna rap with you

[GQ Nothin' Pretty]:
Yeah, ask for Q and I'mma make it fun
Wait for son, outside of a show, with a staple gun
You're a fuckin' fool like April one
You think she's being faithful when she says she's gonna get a facial hon
I've been through more trees than a nature run
I'm blazin' one, per white widow, with The White Shadow that'll break your lungs
I ain't the one, leave fiber optic cables spun around your neck
Throw you in a quarry, coroners will think you drown to death

[Scratch Hook]

[Vorheez]:
SKip the glitz glamor, banana clips and hammers with rubber grips
Lift big banners with propaganda slandering governments
Construct my treasure out the trash you rejected
Snap limbs for pleasure then tag the cast that protects it
Breath left quick, my frame of reference game of death chest kicks
Agressive when tested I put it down like a stressed pit
Excessive, never get too much of a good thing
Till friends started dying, living bamboozled hoodwinked
Plugged sinks overflow, no holes in my bucket
The cup runneth over once I sold out the substance
Throw gold to my subjects like a ceasar in Rome
While I control the republic from my seat at the throne
You never told me nothing, better leave it alone
You ain't my homie, my cousin trying to speak like we grown
Ain't got it all there, now youre caught in the crosshairs
Who thought heâ€™d bring a knife out for Nuclear Warfare?
