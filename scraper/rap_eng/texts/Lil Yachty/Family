Most these niggas they some wannabes

[Verse: Lil Yachty & Johnny Cinco]
I might be the youngest on the QC family tree
But I bet your baby mama sister fond of me
And I won’t take her to my home, she at the omane
These hoes some action, I should give ‘em all a nominee
Yeah, Johnny Papi, I’m the one who made it
And the Rolex that I’m rocking is a one of three
Came a long way from that block, that shit a lot to leave
And that lil money you talkin’ don’t mean none’ to me
And that bitch pussy so wet it’s like a pond to me
Dropped a 30 all on my neck like fuck economy
And my brothers they been with me since the Dollar Tree
And my brothers they been with me since the ahh
If I’m having and they ain’t having we gon’ ball
If I’m stunting then we gon’ be stuntin’ ‘til we fall
I’m in a Wraith, you in a Wraith, we got it all
Nigga we gon’ play, we gon’ ball
Throwin’ up, they was on ball
Pray the paper, planes stay soo tall
Lot of niggas hate, fuck all of y’all

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Most these niggas they some wannabes
If you ain’t my friend then you my enemy
Ain’t got the same blood but he like kin to me
That’s my brother, that’s my family

[Hook: Lil Yachty]

[Outro: Lil Yachty]

These niggas swear they so real
If I get caught they gon peel
These niggas, these niggas pussy
