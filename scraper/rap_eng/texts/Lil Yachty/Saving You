18 in the atrium
Hoop like Paul Pierce, ball out the gymnasium
I was fuckin' up a check at the ATM
Why you call my phone boy? I'm not savin' him
No I'm not savin you
18 in the atrium
Hoop like Paul Pierce, ball out the gymnasium
I was fuckin' up a check at the ATM
Why you call my phone boy? I'm not savin' him
No I'm not savin you

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
All of these niggas is bitches I swear on my momma
I’ll leave em with stitches if they touch my riches
I might call up NAZ for that glizzy
These niggas tryna get in touch for a verse but lil nigga I'm busy
Broke ass nigga window shopping like he 50
Looking for Lil Boat, he probably in the city
With a bad biddy that look like 90’s Tina Fey
Teeth gold like a box of butter shea
One more year and we’ll be living in LA
Me, NAZ, K on me, all my niggas been ridin since day one
Run up on me, you gon' catch the choppa
Meet the gang, that's when you meet the Fockers
I'ma trunk, knock his wife, fuck her
All these niggas hate Lil Boat cause these bitches love me
Back up off me, bitch you looking ugly
Platinum teeth make me hit the Dougie

[Verse 2: Pollari]
Just found a check and ran it up on my lonely
They see that glow and now they wanna be homies
They claim they day one but these niggas so phony
They claim they day one but these goofies don't know me
A thick ass from Texas, they mad I'm flexin'
My bitch Alexis, she drive a Lexus
Yeah, they cannot check this, they cannot check this
My niggas reckless, they snatch ya necklace, yeah
