Fifty shade of purple
Geeked up like Steve Urkel
Purple nurple raise her vocals
I fucking hate these locals

Clyde Dexter in the paint, I get deep like chocolate rain
Pill pop like Max Payne
Tip toe, jockin bitches in my six four
Glock nine make him limbo
Body bag him like a gift wrap
Ziploc, lot of niggas tryna flip flop
Good braids like Kriss Kross
Flashing on 'em like I'm Hasslehoff
All these new niggas apple sauce
Sweet and soft, banks buss, blanks truck
In the base god with ya'll trust
Double dipping that magic stick
Catching plays like I'm Richard Sherman
Speaking to em that Yachty Sermon
I control these frogs like they name was Kermit
Writing shit like I had a priman
Fuck these pussy's they some bitch niggas

Eat them pussy's like my bitch nigga
26 on my wrist nigga
You can check the diamonds, got a nigga blinded
Ask me what the time is, all i see is diamonds
Flexing like the nationals
Hot head, Tabasco
Rugrats like rascals
Young nigga I'm the
