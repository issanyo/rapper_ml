[Refrain: Lil Yachty]
Oh, you say it's good
I say it's great
But it could be better
It always could always be better
You say it's good
But it could be better
It always could always be better
Everything in life could always be better
Don't settle for less 'cause then you miss out on more
Everything in life won't always be pleasure
You work for the treasure just to live even more

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
'Cause you say it's good, but it could be better
It always could always be better
Unlock your happiness and live for forever
I'll express my life in a letter
I love you 'cause you be makin' me better
You make me feel so much better
It could be good
But it could be better
When I'm with you, I feel much better
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Let's lay on the hood and look at the stars
And name them whatever
You always call that one Trevor
Since a young one you've always been clever
Let's grow old, rocking chairs and play checkers
I wanna spend my whole life with you
Without you I feel so blue
I probably lose my train of to dos
All my life I always knew

[Refrain: Lil Yachty]
You say it's good
I say it's great
But it could be better
It always could always be better
You say it's good
But it could be better
It always could always be better
Everything in life could always be better
Don't settle for less 'cause then you miss out on more
Everything in life won't always be pleasure
You work for the treasure just to live even more

[Verse 2: Stefflon Don]
You said I love ya with those eyes so deep
The love you gave me made me feel so sweet
Baby you against the car, you don't deny me
Love the way you love me, I really love you
They must be blind if they can't see
I'll pour it up, I'll take you high
You so fly
Neighbors always come around
When you got me raining down

[Refrain: Lil Yachty]
You say it's good
I say it's great
But it could be better
It always could always be better
You say it's good
But it could be better
It always could always be better
Everything in life could always be better
Don't settle for less 'cause then you miss out on more
Everything in life won't always be pleasure
You work for the treasure just to live even more

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
'Cause you say it's good, but it could be better
It always could always be better
Unlock your happiness and live for forever
I'll express my life in a letter
I love you 'cause you be makin' me better
You make me feel so much better
It could be good
But it could be better
When I'm with you, I feel much better
Oh, oh, oh
