[Intro: Lil Yachty & Yung Bans]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, Boat, Bans, Boat, Bans, Bans, yeah, (Yeah, ay)
Boat, Bans, Boat, Plugg, Bans

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
Ayy, diamonds dancin', all the light hit different colors
Ayy, I just want a bust-down, I don't wanna cuddle
Yeah, count a hundred thousand and I bet they love you (Bitch)

[Verse: Lil Yachty & Yung Bans]
Ayy, all in her jaws like some Lay's, Ruffles
Ayy, .223s, Glocks, we don't do no scuffles
They don't like how I rap, they say I be muffled
Tell the bitch bring her friend, she was the missin' puzzle piece
Yeah, ayy, yeah
Chain swang, gang, gang, woo, yeah, 1of1 the gang, it's the same thang, huh
Ayy, yeah, skrrt off in that Range, huh
Ayy, young ass nigga just doin' my thang
Ayy, and her pussy pink just like Molly, huh
Ridin' with the glizzy and it got mileage (Mileage, huh)
And my young niggas catchin' bodies (Bodies)
I just do the rap shit for a hobby
Got these bitches booted off the Molly, doll
Next week it's Adderall, I can't walk around in malls
Put that X up in her hand, she lookin' like a KAWS doll
I'm in L.A., you in L.A., I'm Kobe, you Chris Paul
It's a difference, I'm gon' fuck her best friend
I ain't got no piercings, my new bitch named Kiersten
Chop with a dick, that shit sing like Charlie Wilson
Yeah, all my niggas gon' get it, huh
Baby, don't talk, just listen

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
Diamonds dancin', all the light hit different colors
Ayy, I just want a bust-down, I don't wanna cuddle
Yeah, count a hundred thousand and I bet they love you
Yeah, count a hundred thousand and I bet they love you

[Outro: Lil Yachty & Yung Bans]
200 on my neck (Damn), I rep the diamond set
Glacier Boyz, new Piguets, fuckin' up the rest
Yeah, ayy, yeah, huh
Ayy, yeah, ran off with your chick
Huh, all the trap niggas gettin' blitzed
