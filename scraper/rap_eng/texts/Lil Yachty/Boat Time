I don't fuck around with these new dudes
Yeah, all these niggas squares like a GameCube

[Hook]
Yeah, niggas talkin' crazy, they'll get sent for
Yeah, I said that I meant that it's done for, damn
Aye, fold a nigga up like the trifold
Niggas see me comin' with a blindfold

Yeah, niggas need to make way cause it's boat time
Yeah, niggas need to make way cause its my time

[Verse 1]
Aye, I just doubled up on my life status
Got a bad white bitch that look like Trish Stratus
Live forever for my gang like the Wu-Tang
Man these bitches always come back like a boomerang
Yeah, speakin' of a ring, I need 5 of 'em
All gold, diamond encrust with the suns on 'em
Need a boat by the lake for my getaways
Over nights is how I tripped off my double play
Yeah, and I did this shit by my damn self
Stayed up over night plannin' all my meal real
So I dare a pussy nigga to try to knock me off
I got his bitch gettin' wetter off this Smirnoff
