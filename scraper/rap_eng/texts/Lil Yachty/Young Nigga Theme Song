Keep some shooters by my side, they on standby
Run up wrong we gon' give you Fetty Wap eye

Now I pull up, they just give it to me unsurprised
All these niggas look surprised cause a nigga up

This a young flexin' nigga theme song (x2)
Pull up wit all them chains on

This a young nigga theme song
Young nigga flexin, this that theme song
