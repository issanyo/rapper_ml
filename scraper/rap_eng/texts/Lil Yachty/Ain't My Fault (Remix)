[Intro: Zara Larsson]
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my

[Verse 1: Zara Larsson]
It ain't my fault you keep turnin' me on
It ain't my fault you got, got me so gone
It ain't my fault I'm not leavin' alone
It ain't my fault you keep turnin' me on

[Pre-Chorus 1: Zara Larsson]
I can't talk right now
I'm lookin' and I like what I'm seein'
Got me feelin' kinda shocked right now
Couldn't stop right now
Even if I wanted, gotta get it, get it, get it, when it's hot right now
Oh my god, what is this?
Want you all in my business
Baby, I insist
Please don't blame me for what ever happens next

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible
If I-I-I-I get you in trouble now
See, you're-'re-'re-'re too irresistible
Yeah, that's for sure
So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see
That you're the one who's got a hold on me
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible, responsible
It ain't my fault (nope, nope, nope, nope…)
It ain't my fault (nope, nope, nope, nope…)
It ain't my fault

[Verse 2: Zara Larsson]
It ain't my fault you came here lookin' like that
You just made me trip, fall, and land on your lap
Certain bad boy smooth
Body hotter than a summer
I don't mean to be rude, but I'd look so damn good on ya

[Pre-Chorus 2: Zara Larsson]
Ain't got time right now
Missed me with that
"What's your name, your sign" right now
It's light outside
I just called an Uber and it's right outside
Oh my god, what is this?
Want you all in my business
Baby, I insist
Please don't blame me for what ever happens next

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible
If I-I-I-I get you in trouble now
See, you're-'re-'re-'re too irresistible
Yeah, that's for sure
So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see
That you're the one who's got a hold on me
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible, responsible
It ain't my fault

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Where's your thot?
Called my friends like, "What you caught last night?"
If the ass right and you ask right, you might spend the night
Sitting so informal with the Sailing Team
And we just might start a dinner fight
Need a white chick that's Kylie Jenner right
Need a black chick that cook my dinner right
But aye, get your bread though, snitches, 5-0
I can't kick it with no side hoe
I need that Lambo
Come through bustin' like I'm Rambo with heavy ammo
And I'm lit just like a candle
Stock up like sandals (Lil Boat!)

[Bridge: Zara Larsson]
Baby, one, two, three
Your body's callin' me
And I know wherever you're at is exactly where I wanna be
But don't blame me
It ain't my fault (nope, nope, nope)
It ain't my fault (nope, nope, nope)
It ain't my fault (nope, nope, nope)
It ain't my fault
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see
That you're the one who's got a hold on me
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible, responsible
It ain't my fault (nope, nope, nope, nope…)
No-oh-oh, it ain't my fault
No-oh-oh, no-oh-oh, no (nope, nope, nope, nope…)
It ain't my fault
It ain't my fault you got me so gone
It ain't my fault you got me so gone
Well, that's too bad, it ain't my fault
