[Intro: Hoodrich Pablo Juan + Lil Yachty]
We got the trap going up, the trap moving slow
My flip phone bunking, I got junkies at my door
Momma told me don't be selling dope, I told my momma no
Nah I ain't going broke, I ain't going broke

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
Nah, damned if I'll be broke
I'll be damned if I'll be broke
Would you do it for that dough?
'Cause I'll be damned if I'll be broke
I'll be damned if I'll be broke
Boy, I'll be damned if I'll be broke
Would you do it for that dough?
Yeah, I'll be damned if I'll be broke
I'll be damned if I'll be broke
Boy, I'll be damned if I'll be broke
Told my momma hell no, I ain't sitting in the house
'Less I'm motherfucking moving this white off the couch
Got a hundred fucking packs coming early in the morning
Hell no, I ain't snoring, motherfucker, I'm up doing push-ups
Pushing weight, goddamn it, I'm looking great

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Juan Pablo]
Tony Tiger, Frosted Flakes
Cooking the dope like it's eggs and steak
Told my momma I'll be damned if I go broke, I need the cake
Working out, I'm pushing weight
Putting them bricks in momma's basement
Cashed out on the 'Rari, no down payment
Whipping the bricks out the bowl like a slave ship
We up all night 'til the grave shift

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Yeah, diamonds real water
Ball like Vince Carter
Move in a Charter
All hundreds like event starter
We throw fifties in the wishing well
All my teachers used to wish me well
But fuck them, though
I'm doing better than I did before
I'm never going back to being broke
I dropped out and did like fifty shows
For the ten track
Add it up, that's a Rolex
Add it up, that's an Audemar
I just came back from Panama
With a Spanish bitch, she likes caviar
Yeah, and I ball like a Cavalier
I was bumping, that was last year
Nigga talking crazy, put the red dot on his ass like a reindeer

[Verse 3: Hoodrich Juan Pablo]
I got bags like I'm Santa Clause
MONY, POWR, cut your lights off
I eat the beef with the steak sauce
Back in, that's a cake walk
Soon as I get themin, I get them off
Get out the boat, go straight to the loft
Plug say I ain't never gonna fall off
Trapstar rockstar, got a guitar
Selling that dope, I ain't listen no more
I ain't listen no more

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
Nah, damned if I'll be broke
I'll be damned if I'll be broke
Would you do it for that dough?
'Cause I'll be damned if I'll be broke
I'll be damned if I'll be broke
Boy, I'll be damned if I'll be broke
Would you do it for that dough?
Yeah, I'll be damned if I'll be broke
I'll be damned if I'll be broke
Boy, I'll be damned if I'll be broke
Told my momma hell no, I ain't sitting in the house
'Less I'm motherfucking moving this white off the couch
Got a hundred fucking packs coming early in the morning
Hell no

[Outro: ILoveMakonnen]
Damned if I'll be broke
I'll be damned if I'll be broke
Damned if I'll be broke
I'll be, I'll be...
Damned if I'll be broke
I'll be damned if I'll...
Damned if I'll be broke
I'll be damned if I'll...
