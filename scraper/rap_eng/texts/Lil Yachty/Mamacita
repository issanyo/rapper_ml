[Intro: Lil Yachty & Rico Nasty]
Aww yeah (Ayy)
Aww yeah (Ayy)
Aww yeah (Ayy)
Aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Mamacita, never seen her 'less the green involved
Only call you when she need you 'cause she want it all
Don't believe her, she deceivin', you should leave her
Aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah (aww yeah)
Mamacita, she a diva, but she put in all
Pour a liter, light the tree up, just to keep her calm (it keep her calm)
This two seater, got the heat up in the seats
Aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah (aww yeah)

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I wouldn't trust her, you should duck her, she thinks you're a sucker
I had her first, and then my friend, and now she with my brother
I bought the black but then I had to go and change the color
To somethin' crazy, promise you will never see another
Aww yeah, we been winnin' all year
I done put diamonds in all of my brothers' ears (bling)
I ran out of time for chasin' after your tears
Whenever you hear music at a party, know she's near

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Mamacita, never seen her 'less the green involved
Only call you when she need you 'cause she want it all
Don't believe her, she deceivin', you should leave her
Aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah (aww yeah)
Mamacita, she a diva, but she put in all
Pour a liter, light the tree up, just to keep her calm (it keep her calm)
This two seater, got the heat up in the seats
Aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah (aww yeah)

[Verse 2: Rico Nasty]
Puerto Rican diva, he call me his mamacita
He don't like to show emotions so it's hard to read him
I'm in the field, you in the bleachers, smokin' Cali reefer
I need the bag from Indonesia, watch him swipe his Visa
I just went and got the new one, tell that girl to keep up
All I gave him was a teaser, now your dude's a geeker
Mamacita so bonita, but I had to freeze her
It still ain't colder than my car, tell that girl to speed up

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Mamacita, never seen her 'less the green involved
Only call you when she need you 'cause she want it all
Don't believe her, she deceivin', you should leave her
Aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah (aww yeah)
Mamacita, she a diva, but she put in all
Pour a liter, light the tree up, just to keep her calm (it keep her calm)
This two seater, got the heat up in the seats
Aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah (aww yeah)

[Bridge: Lil Yachty]
You're a sneaky one, you thought I didn't know
Yeah I saw you creepin' on your tippy toes
She's conceited, she thinks everyone's beneath her
But oh no, no-no-no, no you got it all wrong
Who you been lyin' to?
You called us boys at the bar, you're a lyin' crew
You better hope you never see her, if you do, you better run
'Cause she's a street sweeper, she's a heartbreaker, she's a money-taker

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Mamacita, never seen her 'less the green involved
Only call you when she need you 'cause she want it all
Don't believe her, she deceivin', you should leave her
Aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah (aww yeah)
Mamacita, she a diva, but she put in all
Pour a liter, light the tree up, just to keep her calm (it keep her calm)
This two seater, got the heat up in the seats
Aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah, aww yeah (aww yeah)
