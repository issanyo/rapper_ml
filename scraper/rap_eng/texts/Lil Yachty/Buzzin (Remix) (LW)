[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
They know I'ma ride with you
Pull up on the avenue in something hardly average
Hope I got no problems with you
Cause I know to bag mine like Ross at the fast line
Seventy for a verse and a purse and a feature
Shawty said she love my long hair, look like Jesus
I blow through the hundred pack with you baby

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Lil Yachty]
I still run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
You never stuntin' 'til you met a nigga like me
Don't you disagree, I gave you everything you need
I run through a hundred pack with you baby

[Verse 2: Sinneyy]
I see you grown up now
I wanna get you out the hood now
I love the way you walk
I love the way you talk
You look ready and you look fine
A Inderpendent girl like you should be mine
Flexing on your niggas just in time
1942 tequila and drinking wine
Keep it 100 with you baby
Not seventy,eighty or even ninety?
You were never stunting til' you met a nigga like me
Stop with the fuss with your exs and come with le
I don't get how you keep it real and true
Not like the other women I've been though
There something about you girl
There something about you girl
There something about you girl thats makes you special

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I still run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Lil Yachty]
Keep it nine, keep it ninety nine degrees, keep it a hundred
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
You never stuntin' 'til you met a nigga like me
Don't you disagree, I gave you everything you need
