[Intro: Terintino]
I want the grizzle baby girl, I only want your face
All the problems in the world, it's right here on my waist

[Hook: Terintino]
I want the grizzle baby girl, I only want your face
Forgi's on my coupe, so tall it feel like outer space
All the problems in the world, it's right here on my waist
Please do not get in my way or you'll be on your way
Do you count money or nah?
Do you smoke dope? Oh yeah
Bitch I'm gon' ball, catch me in mid air
Swish swish swish
I'ma ball on you, bitch

[Verse 1: Terintino]
I just found out they hating
My car mounted up, I'm skating
In New York, at Ace's
All this green, I'm racist
Bitch, I got them faces
Louis Vuitton suitcases
Getting massaged by asians
I fucked that bitch and she's taken
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up
Got fajita on me, I dare you to run up
Like Weezy E, I'ma grind 'til the sun up
In the car, 300 on the dash, doing donuts

[Hook: Terintino]
I want the grizzle baby girl, I only want your face
Forgi's on my coupe, so tall it feel like outer space
All the problems in the world, it's right here on my waist
Please do not get in my way or you'll be on your way
Do you count money or nah?
Do you smoke dope? Oh yeah
Bitch I'm gon' ball
Catch me in mid air
Swish, swish, swish
I'ma ball on you, bitch

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
(Lil Boat)
You gonna fuck me or nah? The answer probably yeah
Six strippers in my house, money all in the air
I can tell she wanna fuck me 'cause she playing all in my hair
And I just ran through a hunnid sack, nah nigga, itâ€™s just not fair
Remember the young black rich nigga getting my chain swanged
Lil Boat, lil top off, now (?) but it's still bang bang
And I'm still disrespecting, fuck up any couch like I'm Rick James
Finna pick that G Wagon red, that shit gon' look like a fire flame
Lil Boat

[Hook: Terintino]
I want the grizzle baby girl, I only want your face
Forgi's on my coupe, so tall it feel like outer space
All the problems in the world, it's right here on my waist
Please do not get in my way or you'll be on your way
Do you count money or nah?
Do you smoke dope? Oh yeah
Bitch I'm gon' ball, catch me in mid air
Swish, swish, swish
I'ma ball on you, bitch
