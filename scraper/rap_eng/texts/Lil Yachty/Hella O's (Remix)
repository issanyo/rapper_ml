Lil Yachty-(Intro)

Lean, still get it from the Gusto
Young hot head man, cut throat

Kick back and serve up them O's

Uh, skrt, uh, skrt
Uh, uh
Skrt, skrt

CincoTheFlexGod-(Verse)

Married to the guap I will not divorce it
Yeah, i need me a foreign riding in a foreign
Fuckin' ya bitch I don''t gotta force it
Im always goin' win , you might wanna forfeit
I can't hear a who, cause my name ain't Horton
If it is not bout Cinco , it/s not important

You know its supreme on my underpants
Under that , girl meet the wonderland
Lil $torm , Or Call Me The Thunder Man
Money Long , I call It Slender Man

Im The Shit , Call Up A Plumber Man
Im The Goat, What Dont You Understand
You Fuck Your Plug , Just Like No Jumper Man
Hella O's Wrapped In These Rubber Bands


My pockets fat , and Ya' pockets Bony
Yeah she popping xans , and i ain't talkin' Tony
Cinco got a chain , a holy trophy
You can't control me

Got the racks just like I'm playing tennis
In her mouth like I'm fucking dentist
Like a crouton, bitch I'm by the lettuce
Wait , huh , did you get it ? (yeah)

Balling , got a triple double nigga
Bitch I'm flexing with no muscle nigga
Talking down , you get the knuckle nigga
Diamonds dance like cupid shuffle nigga

Taking off just like a shuttle nigga
Diamonds wet just like a puddle nigga
What you making ? i make double nigga
Blowing paper like a bubble nigga

Lil Yachty-(Hook)

Hella O's, I been counting hella O's
Money stacking tall like Lego's
I been counting hella O's, hella O's

Hella O's, I been counting hella O's
Money stacking tall like Lego's
Told my plug I need a whole fix, serving off O's
I could flip a brick

Hella O's, hella O's
I been moving hella O's
Young RD counting hella O's

CincoTheFlexGod-(Outro)

Huh?

Alright, I'm Done
For real, For real
