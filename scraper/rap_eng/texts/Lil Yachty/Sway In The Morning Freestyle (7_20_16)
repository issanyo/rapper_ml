[Verse]
All I want is head game
30 thousand dollars worth of diamonds like a gumball
Playin' with my money, that's gon' turn a nigga AWOL
Ay, ay, oh, ay
All my dogs biting like a motherfuckin' pit though
Fight 'em like I'm Vick though
Winter time, fur coat
My bitches rock butt flaps
Whip so damn stupid could've parked in handicap
Ay, ay, ay
Chop gon' kick like a bitch that need to kick back
Ay, ay
Niggas want the fame but all these niggas do is kick back
Just met a groovy white bitch at the Shake Shack
Dunkin' in that pussy just like Shaq attack
Ay, hol on, ay, ay
Huh, ay, huh, ay, huh
