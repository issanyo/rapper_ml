[Hook: K$urpreme]
Straight out the pot, straight out the drop
Straight to the top, post on the block
Rockin' my socks, eight feet of guap
Move with the Glock

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty &  K$urpreme]
Fuck up the fuck up
If you so heavy nigga put all your bucks up
Yeah my nigga she stuck up
She get what she want, if she don't she won't shut up
Knuck if you buck up, I ran all, I ran all the guap up
Aye I pour the drop up, aye yeah, I count my knots up
I got more clout than a lot of you niggas
You niggas can't talk to me wrong
Y'all niggas flex in your songs
Nigga you ain't really goonin'
Nigga you ain't really shootin'
Got your main bitch spoonin '
Somewhere out there on the ocean
You look like the type of nigga that said it is about the motion in the ocean
Not the size of the boat
Lil bitch I'm Boat
Dick deep down her throat
Cause she want that new coat
Put the 40 to his nose ayy, put the 40 to his throat ayy
And my necklace on froze
Raf Simons on my toes
Goop got me moving slow
Watch me whip the fucking snow
Cook the dope up with the stove

[Hook: K$urpreme]
Straight out the pot, straight out the drop
Straight to the top, post on the block
Rockin' my socks, eight feet of guap
Move with the Glock

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Pop in the pussy, it's wet like tsunami gang
Upgrade to platinum on my brand new diamond chain
Met like a sentencing, Boat finna make it rain
Kick down his door if he try me, come find me, I'm ridin'
All of my niggas go Stevie, we might take your TV
She fucked on two xans she though it was a roofy
That bitch acting goofy, I chill with Byou [?]
You chain smoke the loosies
I might pop a sixty deucy
That bitch looking dusty that hoe got the cooties
That bitch she can't  suck me if her teeth ain't pearly
And nutted on her face lookin like a swirly
I like my all my bitches girly, my French fries curly
Running just like Gurley
Is these niggas coming close to Boat, barely
All these niggas funny y'all think y'all Chris Farley
