[Intro: DrugRixh Pe$o]
DrugRixh Pe$o
Fuck the police, fuck them

[Chorus: DrugRixh Pe$o]
Fuck 12, had to get them off me
Can't take no loss, gotta be cautious
They say it take patience to be the greatest
Can't fuck with these bitches, they all haters
Stacking them hundreds, I'm motivated
Pouring that lean, I'm getting faded
Your bitch is with me, got her going crazy
We on the molly, getting motivated
We on the Xans, getting motivated
Percocets keep me motivated
The money keep a nigga motivated
These drugs keep a nigga motivated
These narcotics keep me motivated
I made a milly, now I'm motivated
I'm drug dealing, bitch, I'm motivated
Motivated, motivated

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
This money keep a nigga motivated
Yeah, I do what I want and these niggas hating
I got 32 bitches, elimidating
Got the block for block be my own motoracer
Give a fuck 'bout a bitch, I just want my bread
Keep my shooters with me, he keep one in the head
I might cop the Rarri, paint it all red
Most of these niggas be stuck like that nigga Ted

[Verse 2: DrugRixh Pe$o]
Most of these niggas be stuck like Ted
Trapping that dirt cheap grams for the bread
You pussy nigga, I know that you scared
I'm taxing these niggas like Uncle Sam
I was motivated, had a master plan
I put the bitch on the Perc and the Xan
I stayed down from a nick and a gram
DrugRixh, bitch, I am the man
Staying down, getting money, I'm [?]
I was pouring that lean and I got impatient
I had [?] so I had to chase it
I pull up in Rarris, they know we racing
You fuck with Lil Yachty, I'll pull up and spraying
Hop out with the stick
I'm motivated to the drug dealing
And if 12 get by me, nigga, I'll smash

[Chorus: DrugRixh Pe$o]
Fuck 12, had to get them off me
Can't take no loss, gotta be cautious
They say it take patience to be the greatest
Can't fuck with these bitches, they all haters
Stacking them hundreds, I'm motivated
Pouring that lean, I'm getting faded
Your bitch is with me, got her going crazy
We on the molly, getting motivated
We on the Xans, getting motivated
Percocets keep me motivated
The money keep a nigga motivated
These drugs keep a nigga motivated
These narcotics keep me motivated
I made a milly, now I'm motivated
I'm drug dealing, bitch, I'm motivated
Motivated, motivated
