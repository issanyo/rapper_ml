[Verse 1: Lil Yachty and all]
(Lil' Boat, Lil' Boat, Lil' Boat, Lil' Boat, Lil' Boat)
Everyday call my brother on tango (tango)
Used to ride six deep in durango (durango)
At the crib pouring fours in the mango (yeah)
I bought my momma a Range Ro'
Out in LA with the angels
My brother been on the block
For the last three days
He rockin' the same clothes
He said 2 million his main goal
I go nowhere without the gang (gang)
Ain’t no I in team (I ain't no team)
My bitch love to sip lean
That be the shit I like
Running around with them collard greens
Look at my back yard it’s money trees
Stay at the post like a center
Throw 50k like this shit don’t mean nuthin' 2 me
Shout out to the Creekboyz
I got 5 different whips
They all look like car toys
Hot wheels making noise
Beep, beep, beep
I do anything for my boys
Cut a nigga off if he ain’t solid (yeah)
None of my cars got milage
Squad gon' hold me down
Touch one of my gang members
I’m sending rounds
To any town (Lil' Boat)

[Chorus: Creek Boyz]
Everyday we on our grind (on our grind)
Baltimore too many niggas dying (niggas dying)
Gotta watch out for me and mine (me and mine)
Everyday I’m with my team

Gotta watch out for me and mine (me and mine)

Remix so we had to call Lil Boat (Lil Boat)
My side bitch pussy sweeter than a mango (mango)
So lit when I hit the stage (stage)

Choo choo... it’s a train

[Verse 4: ETS Breeze and all]

Baby I came from the bando (came from the bando)
Codeine, drippin' lean, promethazine, fiend baby

[Verse 6: J Reezy and all]
God damn, I’m going insane
Keep putting my niggas in chains
I wanna ball 'n' da game Lebron James
If it ain’t no pain then it ain’t no gain
I'd die for respect and I’d die for my team
Up all night having money dreams

Can’t fuck wit no lames
Don’t tote dat thing you ain’t got no aim
