[Hook: Lil Yachty and Larry League x2]
It seems like everywhere I go they all wanna be like me and my gang
They all straight clones
(Straight clones, straight clones, straight clones)
They all straight clones
(Straight clones, straight clones, straight clones)

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
It seems like everywhere I walk they all look and talk like RD
They wanna be me
Shit like leadin’ the blind, all these niggas Stevie
They copy NAZ, these niggas wannabe
I just might aim the chopper tonight
And I store my ice right by the fuckin' Häagen-Dazs
Them niggas sweet as pie
Never will I rock with that shit up on my guys
Talk down I let it fly, gold teeth catch a bitches eye

[Hook: Lil Yachty and Larry League x2]
It seems like everywhere I go they all wanna be like me and my gang
They all straight clones
(Straight clones, straight clones, straight clones)
They all straight clones
(Straight clones, straight clones, straight clones)

[Verse 2: Larry LoudPack]
She lookin' at me cause she know I got a wallet
You got the drank on me, put it in my goblet
Just let me fold it, keep my pockets on flawless
I’m smoking leaves man it’s too easy, feel like autumn
My shit movin' faster than I’m sellin' it
I know they weak boy, got no skeleton
Do not ask me if you relevant
I’m shinin' on these fakers in my lemon whip

[Hook: Lil Yachty and Larry League x2]
It seems like everywhere I go they all wanna be like me and my gang
They all straight clones
(Straight clones, straight clones, straight clones)
They all straight clones
(Straight clones, straight clones, straight clones)

[Verse 3: DJ Dolphin Tits]
In a white whip, boy I look like Gandalf
Slide that ring on your girls finger, take off
Northside, my guys know I never stop
We pull up to the spot then we make it pop
(Straight clones, straight clones, straight clones)
Then we make it pop, then we make it pop
(Straight clones, straight clones, straight clones)
Then we make it pop
(Straight clones, straight clones, straight clones)
