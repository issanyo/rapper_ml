[Verse 1: Jace]
I'm rappin' back to back 6's
I'm talkin' back to back bitches
I'm talkin' back to the business
The fact that you're actin' like I isn't is trippy
Your whole troop is goofy, no Disney
My denim is Ksuby from city
I'm a ho to these hoes, man they dig me
I'm a ho to these hoes, man they dig me
I done two knots and I'm six feet
Runnin' blunts in from a big screen
Knew I was the best at 16
Ain't from Texas but I sip tea
Ain't from Texas but I sip the tea
Hella chains, think I'm Mr. T
How I did it nigga, it's a mystery
Bout to put these pussies out they misery
Know my momma lookin' like this isn't me
Yeah her baby boy but it's anti-reese
Kathy Bates the hate, yeah I kill 'em clean
Fuck 'em all, 2016
Used to have love for the young niggas till they hated us on sight, no question
Venice beach in the middle of the street like it's summer all year round here, just flexing

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
I'ma take a whole lotta flock and I know it
Sometimes I might be discouraged
But once in my life never have I showed it
I'm tryna work a little, tryna live a lot
I'm tryna make these pussy niggas so mad
All these niggas do is sit and plot
I'm tryna be everything you niggas not
I'm tryna be everything you niggas not
So watch me be everything you niggas not
Watch me be everything you niggas not
Watch me, watch me, watch what I do, watch me, oh

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Chopper style, chopper style
Girl you wild
Rich young nigga on the prowl
Ballin' like there was no foul
I remember I had nothin'
They dick suck you when you stuntin'
Show no love, I know they frontin'
Gang, gang, gang, know how I'm comin'
Thank God I'm thumbin', presidential luncheons
Niggas hate cause we the same age but they eat Lunchables
My new bitch a Huxtable
But I won't touch her, no-no, unless I know she comfortable
I got too much guala
Green and red collar
Gucci, Gucci doctor
Don't you dare hit me unless you comin' proper
Unless you talkin' dollars

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
I'ma take a whole lotta flock and I know it
Sometimes I might be discouraged
But once in my life I never showed it
I'm tryna work a little, tryna live a lot
I'm tryna make these pussy niggas so mad
All these niggas do is sit and plot
I'm tryna be everything you niggas not
I'm tryna be everything you niggas not
So watch me be everything you niggas not
Watch me be everything you niggas not
Watch me, watch me, watch what I do, watch me, oh
