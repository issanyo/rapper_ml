I been getting money, still ain't signed a deal
She wanna try the molly, just to see how it feel
Is your diamonds fake, or are they real
Yeah, my ice so cold, might give you chills
Drugs, drugs drugs,, she wanna try my drugs
She say the perkies might make her fall in love

[Verse 1: Jban$2Turnt]
Rockstar lifestyle for me, might not make this shit
PJs overseas, we take flights on plains and shit
Rackays, I been counting rackays
Coop same color Mayonnaise
This drink dammaged my kidnies
I say rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
There ain’t no saving
Just taste it, just take it
All white diamond supremacist, they racist
Black coop, BOA, look like the Maytrics
She wanna party, drink and get naughty
18 now, we gonna get naughty
Baby, I don't drink no thotties
No Slick Rick, singing Ly D Da Dy
This that smoking shit, fuck it, this that drink pouring shit

[Hook: Jban$2Turnt]
I been getting money, still ain't signed a deal
She wanna try the molly, just to see how it feel
Is your diamonds fake, or are they real
Yeah, my ice so cold, might give you chills
Drugs, drugs drugs,, she wanna try my drugs
She say the perkies might make her fall in love

[Verse 2: Jban$2Turnt]
20 bitches with me, and they brought a friend
She say she got a man, so she can’t come in
And my neck on Rick the ruler
Sticks on my shooter, I heard you and your jeweller
Scott's on my Muler, Frank Muler
Bust down in my high school, I cheating on my tooter
Michael Murry, run it up, maybe sooner
Took my bitch out of Hooters, diamonds dancing like Scooter
2 in the wip, I got a top
Fuck up the Vip, we stand on the couch
I cannot kiss you, your pussy or mouth
Diamonds they hitting right now, diamonds they hitting like pow

[Hook: Jban$2Turnt]
