My diamonds twinkle, water sprinkle
Niggas hate I made it so fast

Ballin’ hard, you can check my finger roll
I’m a rich nigga, you can check my meat roll
Diamonds twinkle, water sprinkle
Niggas hate I made it so fast
I don’t even know but it’s cool though
Ballin’ hard, you can check my finger roll (yeah, yeah)
I’m a rich nigga, you can check my meat roll

Twenty-thousand, I just made it
Hundred bitches ’round me waitin’
I don’t even know why they mad at me
Hah, I remember they used to laugh at me
Now when I’m in town for a show they hit my phone for a pass
But no
Pay your ticket like everybody else
Old ass rappers hang it up on the shelf
Hating on me ’cause I’m doing my thing
Fuck you two times, gettin’ it by all means

Ballin’ hard, you can check my finger roll
I’m a rich nigga, you can check my meat roll
