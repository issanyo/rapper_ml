[Intro: Lil Yachty]
(Yeah, free K$upreme bruh)
I miss my brother (I miss my brother)
I miss my brother (yeah, I miss my brother)
I miss my brother (Lil Boat)

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I miss my brother, that knucklehead nigga
Count figures, fuck bitches, relax and we plot
Remain the same then we train on some thots
Smoking on parole, that nigga too hot
Free my big brother and fuck every cop
Knot full of guap, when you out we gon' spend it
Bitch from the bay, when I link we gon' bend it
Next check I get I'ma cop you a pendant
VVS diamonds, if I shine then you shine
Still NAZ, I can't switch up on my gang
I remember when ya braids didn't hang
I remember nobody knew our name
Now we up higher, more higher than most
End of the year we gon skrt off in Ghost
When you get out we gon' tour coast to coast
Miami cooling, we had the i8
Life getting great, when you eat you eat steak
Right hand forever, I love you forrealla
You hold the pistol, that tell me that you 'bout it
You killing someone for me, I don't doubt it
Shut that shit down when a hoe getting rowdy
Boat and Gun Smoke, we like Eli and Peyton
Need an award for the way that I'm paving
For all these fuck niggas that need them a plan
First class, we gon' look good forever
Sailing Team shawty, put that on my sweater
Red black SLP's like a game of checkers
Where is my check? spent that on my neck
Boat got them old hundreds, that's for real
Thirty thousand on my neck with no deal
Shoutout Slimesito, my shooter, my shooter
Slimey nigga like a nose full of boogers
Free all my robbers and free all my juggers
They think they gon' keep but he'll be out sooner
Free K
