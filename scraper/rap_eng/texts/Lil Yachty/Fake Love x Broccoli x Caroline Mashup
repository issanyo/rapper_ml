[Hook: William]
I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

[Verse 1: Alex]
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never was solid
No, you can't son me
You won't never get to run me

[William]
Just when shit look out of reach
I reach back like one, three

[Alex]
Like one, three

[Verse 2: William & Alex]
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake

[Intro:William & Alex]
Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on (ayy, go Will)
I'm beyond all that fuck shit

[Verse 3: Alex]
Hey lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
Baby touch my gang, we gon' turn this into Columbine
Ice on my neck cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a hitter to get flee

[William]
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn I'm really never home

[Intro 2: William & Alex]
Listen man
G’day, mate
I heard you done got you a dime piece, man
Hell naw, man
One of them Beyoncé, Meagan Good types, man
Nah, nah, nah
Is that true, man?
I just wanna know
Probably not
I mean to be honest with you, she's a…

[William]
Bad thang, fine as hell, thick as fuck
Oh my god, that's my baby
Caroline, you divine
Mighty fine
Shawty really blow the pipe (that's true)
Like a pro
Fuck you thought

[Alex]
Cause great scenes might be great
But I love your bloopers
And perfect's for the urgent
I want forever
Caroline, don't you see that
I want you to be mine

[Outro: William and Alex]
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face (I’m beyond)
Straight up to my face
