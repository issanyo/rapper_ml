[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Aye Aye Aye
Yeah Yeah Yeah

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Bitch it's Lil Boat
Bitch it's Lil Boat and Lil Uno
(x4)

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I got them hoes on the float
They gon' fuck on Lil Boat
Cause they know that I'm next
All of these bitches they stickin' around
Them bitches they just want a check
Bitch you know you can't get no check
Unless Lil Boat he get the neck
I did it just for the flex
Lil bitch I won't take no pictures
Lil bitch I ball like a sixer
I don't drink on liquor
I don't smoke on swishers
No

[Verse 2: Unotheactivist]
Only smoking 'bout the backwoods
You know I got all this lean in my liver
Fuckin' her on the first night
I swear to god I never took that bitch to dinner
Bitch you are fuckin' with winners
Bitch you are not a beginner
Sorry bitch I do not love you
I just wanna fuck you without all these feelings
Bitch I do not wanna love you
I'm smoking backwoods [?]

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty & UnoTheActivist]
Woah damn
I just got in in November now
I'm at the top fucking hoes by their race
Told that lil bitch give me face
But hold on bad bitch I need me some space
And I came in with the K
If a nigga wan' try me I aim at their face
Shootin' no face and no K
So I walk up I kill this nigga day by day

[Verse 4: Lil Yachty]
Woah damn
Please get the fuck out my face
If you ain't talkin' cash
If you not talkin' cheddar
Lil boat I might run for mayor
Lil homie keep the lazer
Hope you do not bring a razer
You brought a knife to a gun fight
So say goodbye to your people
Make a movie like Reagal
Woah, they say Boat you way too Hollywood
It's getting way too hard to reach you
Shit, it was nice to meet you

[Verse 5: Unotheactivist]
Yeah, and how much for a feature
You know I'm testin'
You know I'm testin'
You know I'm smoking on thrash
Nigga they chill and relax
Cause you know I keep the gas
Ooh don't play with my back
Ooh [?]
Fuckin' these hoes back to back
I got the guap in my lap
Run it up run it up run it up
Try to run up catch an uppercut
Smokin' on nothing but gas
Smokin' on nothing but premium

[Verse 6: Lil Yachty]
All these hoes know my name
Bitch it's Lil Boat from the sixer
I keep them hoes by the mixer
He sucked up sauce from the atmosphere
All these lil niggas they copy
They wanna be like the gang
Ain't nobody take my chain
Won't nobody take my chain
No

[Verse 7/Outro: Unotheactivist]
All this ice that's in my ring
Say she like the finer things
Only got designer jeans
Off the xan just sippin' lean
Off the xan just sippin' lean
Double cup double cup double cup
Find me a bae with a bubble butt
I got two bitches had doubled up
Catch him like catch him on lackin'
I swear to god
He gonna bust and bust
Nigga he try to run up
I told him pussy nigga knuck if buck
