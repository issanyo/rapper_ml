[Chorus: PnB Rock & Lil Yachty]
These hoes gon' choose, that's a fact (ayy)
'Cause they know a nigga running up them racks

I woke up this morning, put my neck on froze (froze)
Pulled up in some shit and all them bad hoes chose (skrt, skrt)
I can't fuck with you 'cause you be frauding (yah, yah, yah)
I do what I want because I'm ballin' (I ball)
Ayy, all of my diamonds on glow (ok)
I fucked your bitch, she a hoe (she a hoe)
Nigga, you know you won't go (you won't go)
All of my niggas on go (on go)
I woke up this morning, put my neck on froze (bling)
Pull up in some shit and all the bad hoes chose (yah)

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I just bought my mom a new Porsche (nah for real, I did)
Dropped out of college and hopped off the porch
I said my brother blunt so big, he need a torch (light that shit up)
I got my first Mercedez-Benz and drove it straight off the course (yah, yah, yah, yah)
'Cause I do not follow no rules
600k for my jewels
100k for my Bart (yah), let it hang over my heart (for real)
I bought chains for all my niggas, would've thought I signed my niggas (sailing team)
Where did you find yo' niggas? (for real)
I don't got time for niggas (no, no)
No, no, no, no
I don't got time, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus: PnB Rock & Lil Yachty]
These hoes gon' choose, that's a fact
'Cause they know a nigga running up them racks
'Cause they know a nigga running up them racks

'Cause they know a nigga running up them racks (yah)

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
I just bought Milan a new Gucci bag (I did)
Just so she could say that she used to that (yeah, yeah)

Just so I could say, "where my roof went at?" (where that shit go?)
Ayy, I can not fuck with these lames (never)
They tryna fuck with the gang
I was just selling cocaine (skrt, skrt)
Now I'm on tour with the gang (gang)
We hit the mall, fuck up 50k on the regular, that's just what friends do (my niggas)
I hop off a plane, first class and I bought my A&R a new Benz coupe (ayy)
Ayy, 'cause I'm blessed ('cause I'm blessed)
