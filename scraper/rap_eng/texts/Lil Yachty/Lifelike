[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I'm starting to hate my night life
Up all night like twilight
These bitches wanna hang with Boat

He could do whatever he want now
Night life
I'm starting to hate my night life
I'm starting to hate all of you niggas

You know I'm starting to hate my night life
I might have to fuck a nigga wife
Night life
