Damn, baby girl look so fine in that crop top (fine)
Why my name always in your mouth just like Pop Rocks? (yeah)
I don't understand (no)
Take a pint on the jet, yeah that's contraband (oh)
Diamonds keep me cooler than a ceilin' fan (oh)
All this drink gon' turn a nigga to the Michelin Man (no)

Pick it up, "Who is it?" It's your main ho (brrt)
Your main ho, my gang ho
