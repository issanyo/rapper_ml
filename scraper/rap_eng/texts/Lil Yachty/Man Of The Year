Hey, walk up in this bitch like the
Like the man of the year
I want her if she a rider
In the Woods I'm a trending topic
Cause I'm the man of the year
I got money then went broke
I'ma make that shit all back
Cause I'm the man of the year
I do this shit for all my bros, hey
Do this shit for all my fam, hey
Let me ride when you see me, aye

[Verse 1: Jayaire Woods]
Niggas wanna be me
Know some women that wanted to leave me
I ain't tryna get defeated
I'ma get rich or die tryin'
Gettin' rich, only got time to get achievements
Catch me ballin' like bad defense
Chase cream like peaches
And the pieces to my puzzle
I'ma piece, well I'm a son of somethin' bigger
I'm the nigga
And she my lady, I'm her mister
I won't miss her another beat
Catch me boppin' in the party in the corner of the 6
It be coolin' all the wards, the team
Know you heard about the team
I never was worried about the dream
Word of mouth, I done heard about some things
I ain't worried about them things
Thank God, I got Steph Curry on my team
Got a girl and she might twerk it for the team
Know you heard about the team
I can't count enough
I'ma stuff tic-tacs in my bruh-bruh drink in my cup, uh

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Ain't no doubt about it I'm the man of the year
I done fucked her so good that she started shedding tears
Every single nigga round me is a self-made boss
When I floss, don't ask what it cost, shit might hurt your heart
Get the money by all means, that's the motto
I got rich then my power skyrocketed, auto
Like Nato said, this a yacht master this ain't no fossil
And tell your lame ass dad my money colossal
And tell your lame ass dad, I'll buy every house around you
Just so I can never miss you, this the year I buy a pistol
Cause I got to stay protected and my mixtape was the best
Glad I got that off my chest, I bring rappers back from the dead
Broccoli went gold do I need to say the rest?
It's Lil Boat, all my diamonds go bling-blang-blaow
Let your bitch know you met Lil Boat, bet she say "oh wow"
And now you know I'm man of the year, I won't disappear
Lil Boat, Lil Boat
