[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Yeah!
Lil' Boat!
Larry League in this bitch
KSupreme in this bitch

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Look at my bitch, she a angel
Look at my cup yeah that's rainbows
Different colored diamonds, rainbow
Look at my bitch, she a angel
Flip a nigga different angles
Diamonds dancing do the tango
Look at my bitch, she a angel
Look at my cup yeah that's rainbows
Rainbow, rainbow
Flip a nigga different angles
Look at my bitch, she a angel
Different colored diamonds, rainbow
Rainbow, rainbow
Look at my bitch, she a angel
Flip a nigga different angles
Rainbow, rainbow

[Verse 1: Larry]
Sippin' on rainbow pink blizzard
I cannot speak on these fellas
What the fuck they gon' tell us?
I put the a guac with the lettuce
He feel the pressure, he feel the pressure, he feel the pressure
He wanted some beef, but I just bought me some leather

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I just got a new bitch and she spanish
She sucked that dick way too famished
All of these niggas is fans
Homie go and get your mans
I'm finessin' for the bands
Damn I put 'em in a trance
1500 for my pants
1500 for my jean, damn
Bitch I should've been a dean
I'm in Georgia with the tec
So I'll know when that sting
I remember selling beans
All up in your bitch head, like a can of Oil Sheen
Lil Boat, Gunsmoke, Larry League, ATL's dream team

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Look at my bitch, she a angel
Look at my cup yeah that's rainbows
Different colored diamonds, rainbow
Look at my bitch, she a angel
Flip a nigga different angles
Diamonds dancing do the tango
Look at my bitch, she a angel
Look at my cup yeah that's rainbows
Rainbow, rainbow
Flip a nigga different angles
Look at my bitch, she a angel
Different colored diamonds, rainbow
Rainbow, rainbow
Look at my bitch, she a angel
Flip a nigga different angles
Rainbow, rainbow

[Verse 3: SenseiATL]
Red up in my cup looking like some Georgia clay
Burning up the dope, keep the pack like Green Bay
Diamonds on my neck looking like a ballet
I'm a yung boi flexing, but you know I do not play

[Verse 4: Randy]
Looked in my cup and it's purple
Trapezoid be my circle
We gon' jump you like a hurdle
Wet 'em up like Squirtle
You got that money or not?
I'm in that pussy, Randy Aquanaut
Lil' Boat got all that work on the dock
Randy Orton got 'em in a headlock
I just dropped all my hoes for the drop
Rainbow lean made me do the bebop
Ice cube neck, real life Lench mob
Wit Lil' RD, Free Guwop

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Look at my bitch, she a angel
Look at my cup yeah that's rainbows
Different colored diamonds, rainbow
Look at my bitch, she a angel
Flip a nigga different angles
Diamonds dancing do the tango
Look at my bitch, she a angel
Look at my cup yeah that's rainbows
Rainbow, rainbow
Flip a nigga different angles
Look at my bitch, she a angel
Different colored diamonds, rainbow
Rainbow, rainbow
Look at my bitch, she a angel
Flip a nigga different angles
Rainbow, rainbow
