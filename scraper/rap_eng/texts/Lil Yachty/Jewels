Dozen of them xannies, ayy
My bitch she's so naughty, ayy
Oh, I'm out here catchin' bodies
Smokin' gas while she ridin' on my lolly

[Hook: WHOISTEDDY]
Imma pull up in my coupe with my top down (skrt)
Blowin' backwoods through the roof 'cause I'm up now
I just got the jewels and the juice 'cause I'm rich now
I just got this juice

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]

Mad 'cause I'm countin'

Spend my first 40 on my jewels
Christmas neck I'm too young
