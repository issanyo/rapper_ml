[Chorus]
Never switch up
Never switch up on gang, no
Never switch up
Never switch up with the fame, no
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up no
Never switch up
Never switch up switching lanes, woah
Never switch up, won't let it get to my brain, no
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up, no

[Verse]
I stayed the same
I stayed the same when I got to the fame
Didn't change a thing
Only thing changed was a young nigga name
They call me Lil Boat
Hollywood chilling but I don't do coke
I stayed afloat
Didn't give a fuck what a young nigga thought no
I never cared what a nigga thought 'bout me
No, I never cared
And I think that's why they fuck with me
Cause I stayed down and I kept my original team

[Chorus]
Never switch up
Never switch up on gang, no
Never switch up
Never switch up with the fame, no
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up no
Never switch up
Never switch up switching lanes, woah
Never switch up, won't let it get to my brain, no
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up no
