[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

[Chorus: Katy Perry & Skip Marley]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat
Chained to the beat now
Feelin' good, got good vibes
I can feel it in my feet now
Take a shot, baby loosen up
You're the star of the scene now
Went from readin' magazines to bein' on the cover
Get up in the groove now
Let me see you move now
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Lil Boat

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

[Chorus: Katy Perry & Skip Marley]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Take a shot, don't think about the hangover
You can get drunk, 'cause baby I'ma stay sober
Gon' hit the floor, let me see you move
You worked all week and studied hard in school
So let's have fun tonight (let's have fun)
You can take your hair up out the bun tonight
Fool with me, let me see you get pretty for the city
Put my hand on your ass so they know that you're with me
I'm talkin' super sadity
You with me, you with me, you with me, you with me, you with me
I love you, Katy!
Lil Boat!

[Chorus: Katy Perry & Skip Marley]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
Oh we're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Outro: Katy Perry]
Turn it up
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes
It goes on, and on, and on
Turn it up
It goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, it goes
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm
