[Intro: Lil Yachty & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
30, you a fool for this one (oh-ohh)
Aye this that new edition
We ain't like none of these niggas, no cap (on god)

[Chorus: Lil Yachty & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Aye, had to learn from my wrong
90 thousand dollars spent that shit on my thumb (my thumb)
I've been getting money give a fuck who done seen (done seen)
I've been getting money give a fuck about the scene
I swear I knew this (I know), we got all these bitches choosing (they choose)
Come to the club and they gotta let my crew in
I swear I knew this, you know I'm going with my move thing
Don't need no help I got myself cause I could do this (I can)

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Lil boat, aye, fuck them other niggas, aye
Talking down we gon' opt them, other niggas, aye
Oh, you don't like my sound? hundred round, hundred round (grr)
Empty out a fuck nigga town (phew-phew-phew)
Bitch we was It, I ain't talking 'bout no clown (for real)
I just bought my momma a new house (for real)
You, at your momma crib, bitch you brought your spouse (damn)

[Chorus: Lil Yachty & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Aye, had to learn from my wrong
90 thousand dollars spent that shit on my thumb (my thumb)
I've been getting money give a fuck who done seen (done seen)
I've been getting money give a fuck about the scene
I swear I knew this (I know), we got all these bitches choosing (they choose)
Come to the club and they gotta let my crew in
I swear I knew this, you know I'm going with my move thing
Don't need no help I got myself cause I could do this (I can)

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Cameras flicking when they see me, I'm not average nigga
We really ride with them sticks, no I'm not cappin' nigga
I got diamonds in my teeth I keep it fancy nigga (I keep it fancy)
Don't like to lose by any means I make it happen nigga (I make it happen)
Jumped out the porch when I was young, was tryna make a dollar
I always did the one to lead I ain't never follow (ain't ever follow)
Now they wanna come and fuck with me they ain't had no option (they had no option)
Whole lotta money I ain't broke, no that won't be a problem
(won't be a problem never)
Easy come easy goes
The water raising, I'm just going with the flow
Versace on my ass, Versace on my toes (my toes)
Jumped out the porch to get it, I ain't ever fold (yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Yachty & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Aye, had to learn from my wrong
90 thousand dollars spent that shit on my thumb (my thumb)
I've been getting money give a fuck who done seen (done seen)
I've been getting money give a fuck about the scene
I swear I knew this (I know), we got all these bitches choosing (they choose)
Come to the club and they gotta let my crew in
I swear I knew this, you know I'm going with my move thing
(ohh-oh-oh)
Don't need no help I got myself cause I could do this (I can)
