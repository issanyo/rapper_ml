[Verse 1]
I'm the one who talked to Jesus
I'm the one who got it off the boat
Old hunnids, same age as Regis
Youngest nigga up in [?]
I'm the one who fucked your bitch
I see you looking for me, grab ya clip nigga
I'm about to set it off (I'm about to set it off)
I bought a watch just to floss
Youngest nigga walking in the house on Christmas Eve with the gifts
Lookin' like a damn boss
Shouts out to Rick Ross
Niggas know I love to floss
Bitches know I love to floss
(Yeah, Whoa)

[Bridge]
I did it all just to floss
Everyday I fucking floss
If I don't make it, imma floss
Everyday I fucking floss
(Yeah, Whoa)
Niggas think I'm in love with my dentist 'cause young Yachty love to floss
Niggas know I love to Floss
Niggas know I love to  Floss

[Chorus]
Everyday I fucking floss
When I die imma floss
(Yeah, Whoa)
Everyday I fucking floss
I did it all just to floss
Everyday I fucking floss

[Verse 2]
It was midday, me and BT at the QT counting guap
All these niggas trynna cop, they can suck on my dick
Niggas hatin' on Lil Boat, 'cause they see I'm gettin richer
500 for a picture
Back Woods, no Swisher
I don't even fucking smoke
Fuck around and get smoked
Fuck around wit' Lil Boat

[Bridge]
Know what I'm saying like
I'm a real fine nigga
You feel me? Spend a lot of my [?]
My niggas like to [?]
You feel me? Like, that's just how shit go

[Verse 3]
True finesser
1500 on a pair of jeans, I'm a real flexer
My big nigga they'll really press ya, if it's pressure
Hot nigga need a hot bitch
36 for my wrist, quarter [?]
What you niggas know 'bout having work, with no job
(Hey, Whoa)
