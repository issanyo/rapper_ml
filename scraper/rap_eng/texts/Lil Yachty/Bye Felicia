[Verse: Duwap Kaine]
Niggas be broke no Felicia baby
And I'm in the cut, smoking Kesha Baby
Off the Reffa baby, it's Wiz Khalifa baby
I'm a believer baby and I'm a chiefer baby
Two seater baby, I'm off the meter baby
My shortie said she not broke, I said me neither baby
Flexin' with them bands that's a no, no, no, no
All these bitches thotties, so you know they gon' go
I got trust issues that's why I don't trust a soul
My gun shoot so much, I can't even trust my pole
I be in the trap, I ain't talkin' Home Alone
40, pop a nigga it would take a chromosome
AR-15 it will leave a nigga gone
And I'm gone off this lean and it go straight inside my dome
Why they hating on Duwap, thats the shit I don't know
And I'm still the same nigga, finna drop me up a four
I got chains on my neck, guess thats why she wanted sex
Lil nigga come direct, you know Sito got the tech
And I know that I'm next, that's why I just wanna flex
I'm just flexing on my ex, I'm just counting up that check
Got a 40 you need a Vet, I'ma dog and you a pet
I won't let these niggas rest, got that K he need a vest
I'm just tryna do the best, count more and say less
Sito put that it to your chest, play a bitch just like Chess

[Hook: Duwap Kaine]
Me and my bitch be designed up together, in any weather
Booty soft like a feather
Me and my bitch wear designer together, in any weather
Booty soft like a feather

[Verse: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat !
I'm in Oakland with my new bitch, I !
Pussy wetter than a pool bitch (Yeah, yeah)
Sailing Team we the cool kids, but you knew that!
Gold 'round my neck screaming who that! (Damn)
New lady she made a Lamb (Woah!)
Black & White marble on the floor (Damn)
You baby daddy still selling grams (Shit)
Bye Felicia get up off my dick
Hundred thousand dollars, made that shit in a jiff
Could of bought some diamonds but I spent it on my girl and her kid though (Lil Boat !)

[Hook: Duwap Kaine]
Me and my bitch be designed up together, in any weather
Booty soft like a feather
Me and my bitch wear designer together, in any weather
Booty soft like a feather
