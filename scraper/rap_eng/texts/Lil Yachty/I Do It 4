[Intro: DaniLeigh]
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: DaniLeigh]
I do it for my squad, I do it for my fam
I do it for the bands, I had to thank the man
I do it for my woes, I did it, now I'm goals
And that was part of my plan, I did it, thank the man
I do it for my squad, I do it for my fam
I do it for the bands, I had to thank the man
I do it for my woes, I did it, now I’m goals
And that was part of my plan, I did it, thank the man, yeah

[Verse 1: DaniLeigh]
I be winning, on my Diddy, oh yeah, oh yeah
Travis Scott, I'm so litty, oh yeah (I'm lit)
I put on for my city (305)
And all my day ones coming with me, oh yeah, oh yeah
I’m the GOAT (Yeah)
What can I say? They mad, I know
All of these wins, that's all I know (All I know)
Hold 'em down, that's what I do it for

[Chorus: DaniLeigh & Lil Yachty]
I do it for my squad, I do it for my fam
I do it for the bands, I had to thank the man
I do it for my woes, I did it, now I'm goals
And that was part of my plan, I did it, thank the man
I do it for my squad, I do it for my fam
I do it for the bands, I had to thank the man
I do it for my woes, I did it, now I'm goals (Lil Boat, yeah)
And that was part of my plan, I did it, thank the man

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Ask your baby daddy, I'm goals (Goals)
Diamonds all on my toes (Toes)
Everybody knows who I is in the spot (Yeah)
Walked in with them knots (Yeah)
Walked in with them thots (Thots)
Brother was whippin' that pot, huh (That pot)
Beat it up on the spot (Beat it up)
Do this shit for my mommy, take her to Miami
19 years old, nominated for a Grammy (Okay)
Bang bang like Sosa, dodge that Sammy (Yeah)
Used to ride in the Camry
Now I got a big coupe, finna go scoop up Yung Dani

[Chorus: DaniLeigh & Lil Yachty]

I do it for the bands, I had to thank the man (Yeah)
I do it for my woes, I did it, now I’m goals (Ayy, ayy)
And that was part of my plan, I did it, thank the man (Ok)
I do it for my squad, I do it for my fam (Squad, fam)
I do it for the bands, I had to thank the man (The man)
I do it for my woes, I did it, now I’m goals (Goals)
