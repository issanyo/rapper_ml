[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Damn, that's Surreal right there?
Damn, damn, damn, damn

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Why you had to to do me like that?
Break my heart in two, you ain't ever look back
Ice cold, girl, why you so cold like that? (Damn)
Used to be my world, girl, you on my back (World)
You's a cold-ass girl, cold-ass world (ice cold)
Not the same when we met, you's a different girl (Woo)
Why you had to to do me like that? (Why?)
Why you had to to do me like that? (Why?)
Why you had to to do me like that? (Why?)
Why you had to to do me like that? (Why?)
Okay I understand you poppin', Rolex watch clockin'
Damn, girl, you cold, just like Baskin Robbins

[Verse 1: Renni Rucci]
Say I'm trippin', think I'm actin' different
Life movin' fast, now my bag is different
All this cash I'm gettin', went from rags to riches
Now you switchin' up, it's like you're mad I'm winnin'
We ain't have nothin' together
You was my equal, think you made me better
I held you down, no matter the weather
When bitches was 'round, I never would pressure
But I cannot sweat you, no, I cannot let you
Just fuck up my vibe, it's way too much pressure
Tell me, boy, where the love at?
It's like you're throwin' shots, so I bust back
Rollie, bust that, can't touch that
I'm on a different vibe, can't fuss back
Now it's "Fuck love," can't trust that
Middle fingers up like "fuck that"
I used to be down, now I'm runnin' it up
You wasn't loyal, left you in the dust
I'm in my bag, I cannot give a fuck
Keepin' my heart, yeah, it gotta stay tucked

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Why you had to to do me like that?
Break my heart in two, you ain't ever look back
Ice cold, girl, why you so cold like that? (Damn)
Used to be my world, girl, you on my back (World)
You's a cold-ass girl, cold-ass world (ice cold)
Not the same when we met, you's a different girl (Woo)
Why you had to to do me like that? (Why?)
Why you had to to do me like that? (Why?)
Why you had to to do me like that? (Why?)
Why you had to to do me like that? (Why?)
Okay I understand you poppin', Rolex watch clockin'
Damn, girl, you cold, just like Baskin Robbins

[Verse 2: Renni Rucci]
Wanna be the victim like you ain't play your part
Poppin' that shit like he ain't break my heart
A different bitch every week, all the lies I believed
You ain't ever gonna find a bitch like me
I kept your head in the game
Helped you adjust to the fame, I kept you callin' my name
Sexin' insane, head doctor, blow your brain out
VVS' on my chain now
All them chances I gave out
I'm done cryin', make it rain now
I'm grippin' grain now, you played out
How you played with your love? I don't understand
Now you gotta see me ride for another man
And he gon' treat me better than you ever can
Bitch so cold, they don't understand
You'll see me walkin', I don't wanna talk it out, baby, 'cause I gotta go
I'm on the road, I'm doin' shows
I'm gettin' money while you're chasin' hoes
'Cause that's what you chose

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Why you had to to do me like that?
Break my heart in two, you ain't ever look back
Ice cold, girl, why you so cold like that? (Damn)
Used to be my world, girl, you on my back (World)
You's a cold-ass girl, cold-ass world (ice cold)
Not the same when we met, you's a different girl (Woo)
Why you had to to do me like that? (Why?)
Why you had to to do me like that? (Why?)
Why you had to to do me like that? (Why?)
Why you had to to do me like that? (Why?)
Okay I understand you poppin', Rolex watch clockin'
Damn, girl, you cold, just like Baskin Robbins

[Outro]
Damn, that's Surreal right there?
