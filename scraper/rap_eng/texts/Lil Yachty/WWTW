[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Oh lord... oh lord, oh lord, I be fly as fuck
Fly like white doves, all these niggas scrubs
It was just me and Chub in that black Beamer
Riding down the hill way, he was holding steam
Gleeshie Gleeshie, that's my dawg, he keeps two red beams
I leave residue all on her face like a crack fiend
Brainstormin' how we be the richest team
I done fucked every bitch else in my dreams
Make that pussy cream, make the prettiest bitches scream
Oh lord, you blessed me with all these things
Twenty bands racked up in a nigga jeans
Came up off a night, bitch, Lil Boat king of the teens, I'm out
