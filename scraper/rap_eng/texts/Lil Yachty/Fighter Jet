[Intro:]
You already know whats going on man
Straight player shit
(trapaholic)
Straight player shit
(Sailing team, lil boat)
Smoke straight backwoods nigga
(I don't even smoke)
We don't roll skinnys
We don't roll skinnys
(Hood rich bitch)

[Chorus: Cook LaFlare]
Money make her pussy wet
She say that shit I smoke is off the fighter jet
That lil bitch get freaky on them percocets
She like when I  put molly in the moet
She my lil sex kitten, she my lil pet
I was wild when I was young and now I get respect
Drop 16 racks on them sliders yeah im getting that vet
Me, cars, money, they call that a triple threat
I swear none my niggas strugglin' yeah they all set

[Verse 1: Cook LaFlare]
I got racks too
Bad bitches said she wanna be my lil boo
I might flip that bitch on my trip by your crew
Ive been on the boat, feel them on the boat
In a gorgeous float, and them Forgi's float
Im the best of all time, they said i'm the goat
Told that lil bitch you thick as fuck but we can't elope
Fontainebleau shit lit my dick up like a canelope
Money
I got plug money
I got club money
Bottles of the bubbly
Smashin with the docks
Racks in the shoe box
Couple AK's
Got a few Glocks

[Chorus: Cook LaFlare]
Money make her pussy wet
She say that shit I smoke is off the fighter jet
That lil bitch get freaky on the percocets
She like when I put molly in the moet
She my lil sex kitten, she my lil pet
I was wild when I was young and now I get respect
Drop 16 racks on them sliders yeah im getting that vet
Me, cars, money, they call that a triple threat
I swear none my niggas strugglin' yeah they all set

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
All my niggas straight
All my niggas hit Bombay when we on the bay
All my bitches get butt naked when I say so
I ain't go back to Miami till my case was closed
Ooh, true story
Used to have a bitch named Tory, but she used to bore me
I can't understand why they hate
Oh no
Where you wanna go?
Top floor, top floor, top floor
Woah
Im about my ching chang, ching chang
All my bitches like designer things, and diamond rings

[Chorus: Cook LaFlare]
Money make her pussy wet
She say that shit I smoke is off the fighter jet
That lil bitch get freaky on the percocets
She like when I put molly in the moet
She my lil sex kitten, she my lil pet
I was wild when I was young and now I get respect
Drop 16 racks on them sliders yeah im getting that vet
Me, cars, money, they call that a triple threat
I swear none my niggas strugglin' yeah they all set
