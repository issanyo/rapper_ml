[Intro]
I want you to know
Everywhere I go, Im thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
And everywhere I go, I'm thinking bout you
Thinking bout you

[Verse 1]
Late night when you in your room
And you turn your TV down and turn up yo tunes
Do you look at those pictures of us in your room?
Do ya? Do ya?
I bet so cause when I'm at home alone
And you come across my dome, I hear voices of your moan
And when I look at my dresser every time I see your thong
And it make me think about when I get you alone

[Hook]
Ohh ohh, Baby here we go
Every time we doing great this nigga always mess up the picture
Tell me what’s the issue
I need me some Swishers, to take my mind away
I need to escape
Ohh ohh, baby here we go
Every time we doing great this nigga always mess up the picture
Tell me what’s the issue
I need me some Swishers, to take my mind away
I need to escape

[Verse 2]
And I’m getting tired
Tired of trying
Trying to drag us, but that shit goes nowhere
I miss when you loved me
But I know that means nothing
When I move on I hope that you feel the punishment
The punishment of being stuck with that lame nigga
Who can’t do shit for ya
You know that I’ll be there for ya
But you gotta let me know what’s up

[Hook]
Ohh ohh, Baby here we go
Every time we doing great this nigga always has to mess up the picture
Tell me what’s the issue
I need me some Swishers, to take my mind away
I need to escape
And I’m getting tired
Tired of trying
Trying to drag us, but that shit just goes nowhere
I miss when you loved me
But I know that means nothing
When I move on I hope that you feel the punishment
The punishment of being stuck with that lame nigga
Who can’t do shit for ya

[Outro]
It's RD
My brother Earl on the beat
I need me a bitch who gon' be a nasty freak but only for me
Ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh
Baby here we go
Ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh
