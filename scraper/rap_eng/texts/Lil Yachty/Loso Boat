[Verse 1 : Lil Yachty]
Janga-lang, janga-lang, janga-lang, jang
Wipe off his name if he talk 'bout my gang
Ice on my neck cause a wreck when it bling
Fuck up the scene
Chopper sing if you switch up
Knock him out quick in the split of a hiccup
Loso my nigga he stay with the stick up
Stay where you from if you been throw your clique up
Don't talk 'bout cash if you don't got your check up
Niggas hate Boat cause they know that I'm next up
Yeah
Woah
Damn

[Verse 2 : Loso Loaded]
If I want it I'ma buy it
Valet that coupe when I ride
Got this lil bitch on the side
She got that slip and that slide
Me and Yachty get it straight off the boat
Hunnid' round, gun him down with the scope
I got bread, get that shit by the loaf
Thirty clip extended I let it blow

[Verse 3 : Lil Yachty]
Bro let it go used to post at the store
Used to pour ace in my twos
Now I chill with these jewels and count up my guap
Diamonds same size as a rock
Bro keep the Glock
And it come straight at yo' top
Stop thinking what you thought, bitch nigga
Eighteen years old count seven figures
Make the pussy sing just like Trigga

[Verse 4 : Loso Loaded]
I got cash on demand
Make a pussy nigga jump out the Sprinter van
Blow this money like a fan
Fuckin' with Loaded my niggas are Taliban
Got the Rollie with the charms
Fuck around and put twenty thou' on my other arm
RIP to my mom
Fuck around and give twenty thousand to my other mom

[Interlude : Loso Loaded &  Lil Yachty]
Loso Loaded nigga
Lil Boat
I'm fully loaded nigga
QC
Gettin' this shit off the boat
Yeah, Loso, Lil Boat

[Verse 5 : Lil Yachty]
Just fucked a bitch
Fucked that bitch and her friend
Gave her a bean, she lost her jeans
Everything ain't what it seems
Niggas be faking
Niggas be food just like bacon
I stick to myself now days
I learned I had to go my own ways
Young nigga I be rich for days
Boat Madden man I stay making plays

[Verse 6 : Loso Loaded]
Niggas some bitches
Niggas keep switchin'
In the kitchen got your bitch doin' dishes
Panorama throw them racks out the ceiling
I'm a boss, live my live like I'm Nitty
Ninth ward nigga we run the city
Slaughter gang nigga they run the bity
Marc Jacobs every step, so exquisite
All these broke nigga's bitches I'm killin'

[Outro : Loso Loaded]
Woah
I'm killin'
These bitches I'm killin'
I'm killin'
I'm dealin'
I'm killin'
These bitches I'm killin'
I'm killin'
I'm dealin'
Loso Loaded, Lil Boat
Gone
