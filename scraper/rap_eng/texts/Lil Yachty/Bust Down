[Intro: Kodie Shane]
Hey, yeah, yeah
Slatt
Hey, who
Hey, who
You, hey, you

[Chorus: Kodie Shane]
Diamonds on me like a bust down
She just want me 'cause I'm up now
I do not know who to trust now
Rick Owens on me, dress it up now
She said she know who she love, hey, yeah
She said she know who she love now, hey
These diamonds on me like a bust down
She just want me 'cause I'm up now
I do not know who to trust now
Rick Owens on me, dress it up now
She said she know who she love, yeah, yeah
She said she know who she love now

[Verse 1: Kodie Shane]
Yeah, can you read between the lines?
[?] ask you 'bout them, would you lie?
Who you loyal to, babe, me or them?
Who you loyal to, babe, them or us?
These hoes, they tried to fuck up my trust
I put my love in a cup
Ran over her heart with a truck
Ball like the Milwaukee Bucks
Them niggas not showin' no love to Ko'
They came with me, it's a lot of them
Yes, they're my hoes so don't bother them

[Bridge: Kodie Shane]
Hey, hey
Diamonds on me like a bust
Hey, hey
Who you loyal to, babe, them or us?
Hey, hey

[Chorus: Kodie Shane & Lil Yachty]

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Just bought my brother a new bust down
I wanna fuck, do not fuss now
We ride Bentley Beamer trucks now
When we step out, yeah, we dress down
I don't even gotta flex now
She just wanna give me sex now
I got a million dollars worth of jewelry now
[?]
I got a redhead just like me, I call her Fury
Ball like I'm Curry, swish
She eat that dick like it's curry
I been runnin' round like mari
Stay with my brother Jeff Hardy
You'll never catch me in a party
I'm way too rich for the scene
She wanna feel on my jeans
She popped a bean, percocet
It got her too mean, and she like lean
I'ma have her sippin' clean
Kodie and Boat, we the dream team
Diamonds marine, diamonds get wet like marine
Lil Boat

[Chorus: Kodie Shane & Lil Yachty]
Diamonds on me like a bust down
She just want me 'cause I'm up now (now)
I do not know who to trust now (now)
Rick Owens on me, dress it up now (woah)
She said she know who she love, hey, yeah
She said she know who she love now
Yeah, she said she know who she love now
These diamonds on me like a bust down (bust down)
She just want me 'cause I'm up now (up now)
I do not know who to trust now (now)
Rick Owens on me, dress it up now (oh, woah)
She said she know who she love, yeah, yeah
She said she know who she love now
