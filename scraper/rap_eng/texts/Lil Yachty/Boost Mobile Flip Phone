[Hook]
I'm flexing hard on my boost mobile flip phone
I'm flexing hard, trapping in these streets
Whipping on the stove
Know just how it go
I'm flexing hard on my boost mobile flip phone
I'm flexing hard, when I'm on a roll
Girl you should know
Know just how it go

[Verse]
Okay, okay
My neck on ice cold, chill
It's real gold, not stain steel
Your bitch know how it feel
I keep shit for real
I'm balling like a Knick
My dog on fight, I'm Vick
Got guap inside these ricks
I might nut in your bitch
And make you raise that shit
It's Yachty from the 6
Got no love for no bitch
You know I'm with my clique
And free the love
Yaaah
I been jugging, finessing

[Hook]
I'm flexing hard on my boost mobile flip phone
I'm flexing hard, trapping in these streets
Whipping on the stove
Know just how it go
I'm flexing hard on my boost mobile flip phone
I'm flexing hard, when I'm on a roll
Girl you should know
Know just how it go
I'm flexing hard on my boost mobile flip phone
I'm flexing hard, trapping in these streets
Whipping on the stove
Know just how it go
I'm flexing hard on my boost mobile flip phone
I'm flexing hard, when I'm on a roll
Girl you should know
Know just how it go
