[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Release that clip at his tummy
He a dead man like a mummy
Release that clip at his tummy
He a dead man like a mummy
Release that clip at his tummy
He a dead man like a mummy

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I got more bands than your family
Pussy nigga, don't you ever talk crazy
I give a fuck 'bout a bitch
You can find me in the 6
Peep the ice rink on my wrist
They call me debra like yola
I might pull up in that Rover with my gang from Pensacola and they shootin'
Them niggas aimin' at strollers
If I bring it out it's over
They ain't come out here for nothin'
Promise they gon' shoot at somethin'
Ya bitch love on me cause my shmoney
She hop on dick like a bunny
Release that clip at his tummy
He a dead man like a mummy
Send a few shots to his mommy if he make another threat to hurt my family
I don't give no fuck 'bout nobody
I know some some billis a town
But none 'em niggas got a body
Call a chop to load my shotty

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Ride out
Ride out, ride out, ride out
Ride out, ride out
Ride out, ride out
Ride out, ride out, ride out
Niggas talkin' down, niggas talkin' down
Ride out
Ride out
Ride out

[Verse 2: K$upreme]
Put the drugs in the goyard then go
Cookin' up over the stove
All my niggas trained to go
Treat a bitch like a hoe
Kick down a nigga door
If I heard he holdin' dough
Get down on the floor
Whip the fork in slow-mo
Eat the pussy, hell no
On my soul, I can't go
Nigga you a average joe
Try me nigga, I'mma blow
We can't text hoes they ho
You know that I'm at my glo
Cause basedgod I'm fully load
Post up at the corner store

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Ride out
Ride out, ride out, ride out
Ride out, ride out
Ride out, ride out
Ride out, ride out, ride out
Niggas talkin' down, niggas talkin' down
Ride out
Ride out
Ride out
