[Chorus]

Shawty do the dance on the pole
Ass drop down to the floor
Whatcha gonna do for the dough
I ain't switchin' up, I got more

I got dough dough dough (stacks)
Dough dough dough (racks)
Dough dough dough (stacks)
Dough dough dough (racks)

[Verse 1]

She just want a n*gga with it all
(Oh) Do a couple bands watch it fall
Baby girl is reaching for it all
Make sure you don't spend it at the mall

'Cause we got stacks (stacks)
Credit card maxed (swipe)
Spendin' my racks (cash)
Bendin' that back (damn)
Bitch we got bags (back)
Through the S Class (skrrr)
Pull up on smash

[Chorus]

Shawty do the dance on the pole
Ass drop down to the floor
Whatchya gonna do for the dough

I got dough dough dough (stacks, stacks)
Dough dough dough (racks, racks)
Dough dough dough (stacks, stacks)
Dough dough dough (racks, racks)

[Verse 2]

She don't drop it low just for nothing (drop it down, yeah)
Got these bands I gotta throw something ([?])
[?] sex baby will you love me?
If I bring you to the pad now will you fuck me?

[Bridge]

She move like a barbie
I be like a party
Only rock versace
She work with her body
Drop it to the floor yeah
Let me see you naughty
Taught me in the 'Rari
Yeah I work slowly

[Chorus]

Shawty do the dance on the pole (do a dance on the pole)
Ass drop down to the floor (Drop Drop Drop)
Whatchya gonna do for the dough
I ain't spend it all, I got more

I got dough dough dough (stacks, stacks)
Dough dough dough (racks, racks)
Dough dough dough (stacks, stacks)
Dough dough dough (racks, racks)
