[Intro: Trippie Redd]
Earl on the beat
Yeah, yeah, ah-ah, yea-ah, yea-ah

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Shawty know I do things, uh
Pull up in that two seated coupe thing, uh
Big flexing with your boo thing, uh
Yeah, I switch cars like my mood swings
Yea-ah-ah, mood swings
Switch cars like my mood swings
Yeah, I switch lanes like my mood swings
Yea-a-ah, like my mood swings
Yeah, I switch cars like my mood swings

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Bought a big Bentley coupe, not no Mulsanne (skrrt)
Used to sip drank, not no champagne (hah, hah)
Got a big AR, let it bang-bang (bang-bang)
Keep that heat inferno like I'm Dante (hah)
Got a new freaky bitch, she so raunchy (she so raunchy)
I'm a rich nigga, I don't go on blind dates (no)
Took the Cuban off, it feel like you lifting weights (hah, hah)
On the blogs dick ridin', don't say shit to my face (hah)
You's a bitch anyway (hah)

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Shawty know I do things, uh
Pull up in that two seated coupe thing, uh
Big flexing with your boo thing, uh
Yeah, I switch cars like my mood swings
Yea-ah-ah, mood swings
Switch cars like my mood swings
Yeah, I switch lanes like my mood swings
Yea-a-ah, like my mood swings
Yeah, I switch cars like my mood swings
