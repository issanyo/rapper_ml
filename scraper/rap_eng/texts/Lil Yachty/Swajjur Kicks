[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Lean with my Brisk, curve hard when I sip
Ayy, this that swajjur shit, I lean hard when I sip
No, them my swajjur kicks, ain't that 'bout a bitch

[Break: Lil Yachty & Valee]
Clean it up, go ahead
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney!

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty & 10k.Caash]
I look good, ooh
I'ma run that sack up to the ceiling like I should
I got two for five, Applebee's, in the hood
She gon' let me smash cause she love rapper wood
Pump then I dump, blicks in the trunk
White cheddar cheese (Swiss), it's in between
Yes, I like my money green, smokin' OG trees
Chillin' high overseas in my polo black tee
Chillin' with Yachty, I'm too geeked

[Chorus: 10k.Caash & Valee]
Lean with my Brisk, curve hard when I sip
Ayy, this that swajjur shit, I lean hard when I sip
No, them my swajjur kicks, ain't that 'bout a bitch
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney!

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty & 10k.Caash]
Shoutout Chase
Beat that bitch throat, make he walk out with a brace
Nut all on her tongue, ask that baby how it taste, ooh
Ain't no face, ain't no case, hit the jakes
Pass me a lighter, what it do's a pyre
Yes, nation stats gettin' higher and, yes, I burned the red lighter
No, swajjur didn't retire, swajjur, lean, daps
Zombies comin' out, I'm [?] style, geeked

[Chorus: 10k.Caash & Valee]
Lean with my Brisk, curve hard when I sip
Ayy, this that swajjur shit, I lean hard when I sip
No, them my swajjur kicks, ain't that 'bout a bitch
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney!
