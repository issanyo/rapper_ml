[Chorus 1]
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night

[Verse 1]
I know you want this for life
Fuck you so good you be calling out the Christ
Bottles of the Tech got it laid on ice
We spent four seasons at the Four Seasons twice
You be calling all your homegirls like "I'm his wife"
Hell nah, you trippin', reevaluate your life
I can't love no bitch, every single ho is trife
I sip dirty Sprite just to get me through the night
But I need you there
Promise that I need you there
Ain't no other bitch gon' fuck me like you do I swear
Put that on my gang I swear
I just can't put you on front street like you want I know
But baby you is not no ho
And I put it on my gang I'm not no average joe
It's Yachty from the block you know

[Chorus 1]
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night

[Verse 2]
Don't you tell no one, no, no, no
Baby don't you tell no one
We gon' keep this just between us, we gon' have some fun
Fuck until the mornin' come, when the mornin' come
I'll make you cum but then then I gotta run
Cause baby, I got shit to do
Stack my bread up, fuck ya head up, that's just what I'll do
Chillin' on my avenue, if you ain't remember, I remember, girl
That's where I first met you
You had you a drink or two
You came over half and sober callin' me your boo
Then you turned around and fucked the crew
I got no love for you

[Chorus 2]
I can't have no wife, one night
You want this for life
But, I can't I can't have no wife
No wife, no, no wife
Just one night, one night
I can't, can't have no wife
I know you want this for life
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for one night

[Outro]
I just want you for one night
A night, you want this for life, but no
No, no, no
I can't have no wife
