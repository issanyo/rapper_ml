[Intro: Darnell Boat]
Well, this is more like it
See I know these youngsters don't know nothing about this here
This that Thanksgiving my time
This come on Christmas time my time
These youngsters swear they know something, boy
All 'em boys wanna talk about is
"Bitch suck my dick this", "hoe suck my dick that"
Boy, them youngsters is crazy, I can't even control 'em sometimes
I tell you
I love them boys though, them boys my boys

[Hook: Lil Boat]
I fuck my bitches by the sixes, no goin' steady
I fuck my bitches by the sixes, no goin' steady
She gon' suck me up, suck me up like some damn spaghetti
I fuck my bitches by the sixes, no goin' steady
She gon' ride Boat all night long just like a Chevy
I fuck my bitches by the sixes, no goin' steady
She wanna borrow money, I'm like no
I just thought that I would let you know

[Verse 1: Lil Boat]
I fuck your bitches by the sixes, don't ask no questions
Ball like a Sixer, don't drink liquor, this shit too easy
Rich lookin' Freezy, call her slushy, I need a taste
Retro my Jordan, now I feel like CJ and Chase
Thinkin' shit sweet, thats how Boat gon' catch him a new case
Tip toe my way up to the top, I did it in days
But don't you dare worry 'bout Boat
I keep at least like ten hoes

[Hook: Lil Boat]
I fuck my bitches by the sixes, no goin' steady
I fuck my bitches by the sixes, no goin' steady
She gon' suck me up, suck me up like some damn spaghetti
I fuck my bitches by the sixes, no goin' steady
She gon' ride Boat all night long just like a Chevy
I fuck my bitches by the sixes, no goin' steady
She wanna borrow money, I'm like no
I just thought that I would let you know

[Verse 2: Lil Boat]
I had 3 play run in one day, can't you tell I'm sleepy
Two Japanese hoes at my show, they just wanna greet me
Fuck all the chit chat, kill promoters that's tryin' cheat me
Red bottom sneakers look like I just stepped out a TV
Bitch from Hawaii got a crib right next to the tiki
I love how you fuck me, but Lil Boat, I hate how you treat me
Lil bitch it's time to go
I been chillin' too too long, I gotta get back to my Boat
