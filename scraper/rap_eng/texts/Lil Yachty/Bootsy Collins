[Hook: Ken Rebel]
Count up a few bands
Servin' like a mail man
Strippers on my timeline
Make 'em do a handstand
Pull up in a big body
Swerve off with a few thotties
Money make a rich nigga
I be flexed up in the lobby
Count up a few bands
Servin' like a mail man
Strippers on my timeline
Make 'em do a handstand
Pull up in a big body
Swerve off with a few thotties
Money make a rich nigga
I be flexed up in the lobby

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Bitch I'm the king of the teens
Young rich nigga, I'm a Gucci fiend
Bitches they on me like wife beaters
Lil Boat can never be a wife beater
I don't risk shit, I'mma ice keeper
Night sweeper, money eater
Me and Young Kenny skurt off in the Bentley
You niggas lame, and heared I rocked Givenchy
Lil bitch, lil snitch
Lil I throw my friend in the ditch
Lil my gang can't want till I switch
All you pussy niggas bitches
I'm young and I love all my riches
I can't trip on one bitches there's more fishes
Need a new Bimmers cause I want more tickets
I put that lil bitch on her knees, make her lick it
Lil Boat!

[Verse 2: Ken Rebel]
Bootsy Collins, on my Boosty Collins
She said "Ken you wildin!"
Yeah these bezzles shinin'
Might just flex up on ya
Diamond vest up on ya
Three stacks in my denim
Callers think (?)
I'm a dog on 'em
Money got long on 'em
Flood my Jesus piece
Talk to God on him
I live a get rich die type of life
Pour champagne all on your ride
Put my dick all in your dame
Ma could make it die bitch mine survived
Who you think you foolin?
Y'all niggas Dorito flexin'
That is not your cheese
Believe me, I know it's depressin'
Purple in your cup
We do it from the beginin'
Freak hoe in my lap
She rub it like it's a genie
