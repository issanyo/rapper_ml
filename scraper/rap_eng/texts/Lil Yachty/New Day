[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah, know I got that white kid with me, nigga, know what I'm sayin'
I ain't gon' waist no time, nigga
Right to it

[Chorus: Young Thug & Lil Yachty]
I play in Bentleys while you playin' 2K (2K)
Count up some digits, drop 'em on your toupee (toupee)
I mix that Actavis  with some lil' Kool-Aid (Kool-Aid, lean, lean)
I took your bitch from her, she earned a new name (call her...)
Get inside that bitch, then go Mike it like a champagne (inside that bitch)
Earned all my racks, now I rock gold like a Ace of Spades (Ace of Spades)
Fell in love with a brick, fuck you hoes on a bad day (ayy, ayy)
Shoulda dyed my hair grey, 'cause I'm goin' out like OJ
Lil Boat, Lil Boat
Like OJ (Lil Boat)

[Verse 1: Nicky D's]
Lots of duplicates, yeah all my bitches come in twos now
She say, "You look stressed so just lay back," man what a true pal
I done been in some real shootouts
Places that you cannot move 'round
Blowin' on pack and it's too loud
All of my homies scream uptown
I just thought you should know a few things about the kid
If I hit it once you gon' feel it all around your ribs
You just wanna fuck 'cause you heard I'm bout to be rich
It's a new day, and I'm in the kitchen whippin' like a souffl√©
Got a Creole lil' shawty, my new bae
She be at the crib like a roommate
When I tell her pull up

[Chorus: Young Thug & Lil Yachty]
I play in Bentleys while you playin' 2K (2K)
Count up some digits, drop 'em on your toupee (toupee)
I mix that Actavis  with some lil' Kool-Aid (Kool-Aid, lean, lean)
I took your bitch from her, she earned a new name (call her...)
Get inside that bitch, then go Mike it like a champagne (inside that bitch)
Earned all my racks, now I rock gold like a Ace of Spades (Ace of Spades)
Fell in love with a brick, fuck you hoes on a bad day (ayy, ayy)
Shoulda dyed my hair grey, 'cause I'm goin' out like OJ
Lil Boat, Lil Boat
Like OJ (Lil Boat)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Got a lil', got a lil' bitch from Lil Haiti
Watch her go wipe that lil' baby (lil' baby)
Would I share money with you? That's a no
My nigga, that's not a maybe (no)
Top of the buildin', coolin', I be chillin'
I see the pavilion, I fuck up a million (pew, pew, pew)
My rides all dirty, I feel like Chamillion
I run up that sack for my future children, gang
I'm (Lil Boat) finna (Lil Boat) have to (Lil Boat) run it up
Back that ass back like a dump truck (beep)
Niggas be hatin' that I'm up (yeah)
They ain't want me to win, but I did (no)
Make that bitch squirt like a squid (squirt)
That bitch got makeup over my white cover
I fought like I fuck her, don't fall like I love her
All of these pussy rap niggas be suckas
Ain't goin' out like that, no

[Chorus: Young Thug & Lil Yachty]
I play in Bentleys while you playin' 2K (2K)
Count up some digits, drop 'em on your toupee (toupee)
I mix that Actavis  with some lil' Kool-Aid (Kool-Aid, lean, lean)
I took your bitch from her, she earned a new name (call her...)
Get inside that bitch, then go Mike it like a champagne (inside that bitch)
Earned all my racks, now I rock gold like a Ace of Spades (Ace of Spades)
Fell in love with a brick, fuck you hoes on a bad day (ayy, ayy)
Shoulda died my hair grey, 'cause I'm goin' out like OJ
Lil Boat, Lil Boat
Like OJ (Lil Boat)

[Verse 3: Nicky D's]
Thugger brought lean and Yachty got Sprite
Now we in commercials like we takin' flights
But I be in PJs like sleepin' at night
I be in PJs like sleepin' at night
Haters be talkin' like they got the right
But I be confused like...
What? Fuck is you speakin' on? Who is you schemin' on?
Peep your whole convo like speakerphone (yah)
Know that sideways shit
They be talkin' 'bout every fuckin' time that my back turned
Yeah all you pussy cats need a pap smear
Like Papoose, I ain't ever dropped a wack verse
Last hearse came for a body I caught
They ain't even make it up to the lobby at all
It's obvious, dog, I'm prolly the one 'cause they be callin' me up
You want a verse then slide me the funds?
I give a fuck
It's a new day err day
We goin' up like doors in a Merci'
Nice like a kid on a first date
When a verse lay everybody screw their face up in the worst way
I put on for Ireland
Bitches in Dublin get wet like a fireman
Or like Leviathan, say that you ballin' then buy it then
Or take your tongue and just bite it then
Hush little baby, you rappers is hoes
Attracted to hoes that be smashin' my folk
I'm used to the cold, I adapted to wolves
But we all be like, "who you actin' up for?"
These questions need answers
Bet all your bands up
I get MM bop like a Hanson
Young D's got juice like a hansen
Tell 'em all hold up like ransom

[Chorus: Young Thug & Lil Yachty]
I play in Bentleys while you playin' 2K (2K)
Count up some digits, drop 'em on your toupee (toupee)
I mix that Actavis  with some lil' Kool-Aid (Kool-Aid, lean, lean)

Get inside that bitch, then go Mike it like a champagne (inside that bitch)
Earned all my racks, now I rock gold like a Ace of Spades (Ace of Spades)

Lil Boat, Lil Boat
Like OJ (Lil Boat)
