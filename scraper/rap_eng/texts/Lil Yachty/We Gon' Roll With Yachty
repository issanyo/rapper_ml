[Intro: The Black Squad + Lil Yachty]
Drop the beat DJ D-Wreck
How you wanna do it?

(Ooh)
We all on a boat right?
(Ooh)
Turn up!
(Ooh)
And we lookin' for all the sexy ladies
(Ooh)
This how we gonna do it
(Ooh)
This how we gonna do it

[Chorus: The Black Squad & Lil Yachty]
We gon' have a party
Lookin' for some hotties
You go row your boat
But we gon' roll with Yachty!
(Lil Boat)
We gon' roll with Yachty!
We gon' roll with Yachty!
We gon' roll with Yachty!
(Lil Boat)
We gon' roll with Yachty!

[Verse 1: Justina Valentine]
I see him on the boat
And there was where we met
You know we on the water
So he got me drippin' wet

[Verse 2: Hitman Holla]

She think we both are wavy
We hit with different strokes
(Ahhh!)

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Hey, lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
You gon' row your boat
Or you gon' have a fun time

[Chorus: The Black Squad & Lil Yachty]
We gon' have a party
Lookin' for some hotties
You go row your boat
(Lil Boat)
But we gon' roll with Yachty!
(Lil Boat)
