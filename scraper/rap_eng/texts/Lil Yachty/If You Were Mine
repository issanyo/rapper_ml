[Intro: Ocean Park Standoff & (Lil Yachty)]
If you were mine (ooh)
If you were mine (ooh)

[Verse 1: Ocean Park Standoff]
Left to right, at the lights, we're speeding down the road
Leave it all, all behind, everything you think you know
You been hurt but I won't, won't fix you, you're not broke
What you are is beautiful to me

[Pre-Chorus: Ocean Park Standoff]
You could go left, but know I'm right
You gotta make, make up your mind

[Chorus: Ocean Park Standoff & (Lil Yachty)]
We could go anywhere, but if we take it there
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh
You on the other side, I-I can change your mind
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh
If you were mine (ooh)
If you were mine (ooh)
You on the other side, I-I can change your mind
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Ocean Park Standoff]
Flashing light in your eyes, like fire as it grows
I can fly, no, but I, I never can let go
You been hurt, so have I, yeah, we got scars to show
But I swear, it's worth it, wait and see

[Pre-Chorus: Ocean Park Standoff]
You could go left, but know I'm right
You gotta make, make up your mind

[Chorus: Ocean Park Standoff & (Lil Yachty)]
We could go anywhere, but if we take it there
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh
You on the other side, I-I can change your mind
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh
If you were mine (ooh)
If you were mine (ooh)
You on the other side, I-I can change your mind
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Let me exercise your mind
Forget about the time, just for a minute (just for a minute)
Let me take you to a different life
So you can fantasize, just what I'm thinking (just what I'm thinking)
We can go anywhere, hit the beach up in February
Baby, Lil Boat's a millionaire, no briefcase questionnaire
Have you looking so pretty when we riding through the city
I'm the man with the power, now I'm feeling like 50 (Lil Boat)

[Chorus: Ocean Park Standoff & (Lil Yachty)]
We could go anywhere, but if we take it there
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh
You on the other side, I-I can change your mind
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh
If you were mine (ooh)
If you were mine (ooh)
You on the other side, I-I can change your mind
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh
If you were mine (ooh)
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh
If you were mine (ooh)
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh
