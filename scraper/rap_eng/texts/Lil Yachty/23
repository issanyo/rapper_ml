VROOM VROOM

[Chorus]
I just wanna ball, Like I'm 23
Won’t you get with me? You should get with me
I just wanna ball, like I'm 23
Like I'm 23, Yeah I'm 23

[Verse 1: Unghetto Mathieu]
Shoot in these lil nigga faces (pew pew, BALL, ouuuu)
Shorty cannot replace me just face it
All them others you’re hanging with basic
Look at your hoe she can’t do me
Look at my life issa movie
You know my fooly keep a tooly
Stick together like Max & Ruby
I want my payment every penny
If not then I disappear like I’m houdini
Pass me the ball I'm finna TD
She trying to cuff like LAPD, (teee, yee)
All these lil whores wanna be me
Pay attention it ain’t easy
Shout out the nawfside & free Meek, (freee meek)
Diamonds crying on meee
Feds spying on me
Hoes lying on me
But I been ballin all week. (Swish)
You niggas be committing treason
I skip hibernation y’all sleep every season
She swear she got that juicy ima shoot my shot like 23

Haters.. cold.. polar..bears...

You can..stand..over..there

[Chorus]
I just wanna ball, Like I'm 23
Won’t you get with me? You should get with me
I just wanna ball, like I'm 23
Like I'm 23, Yeah I'm 23
I just wanna ball, Like I'm 23
Won’t you get with me? You should get with me
I just wanna ball, like I'm 23
Like I'm 23, (LIL BOAT) Yeah I'm 23

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
B!tch I ball like 23, ball like 45
Keep a .45 on my hip cause it’s time to ride
N!ggas think shit sweet ‘til it’s go time or no time
I had to let them know it was my time
Like I’m next in line

Like I’m out of mind like I’m out of line
Gave these b!tches right up out the pan
Ball like I’m playing right in front
Of like a hundred thousand hundred thousand fans, (LIL BOAT!)
Who is he? Someone get their mans, (Lil Boat)
I ain’t fvcking with these n!ggas
Cause these n!ggas pure pussy & their fragile..
A n!gga ball like Harden

Oops, excuse me, pardon
Have you seen me lately?
A n!gga really had to glow up
Cause them people didn’t wanna grow up
Had to leave them n!ggas in the past tense
Couldn’t reach me like a gated fence
When i know & i know (mumbles something)
You can kiss my ass (LIL BOAT)

[Unghetto Mathieu]
Shot wet splish splashh
Tell me why you ain't see me when I wasn’t seeing this cash
Jimmy nuetron “gotta blast”
I’ve been goin up fast
Live this day like my last
Live this day like my laaaaast!

[Chorus]
I just wanna ball, Like I'm 23
Won’t you get with me? You should get with me
I just wanna ball, like I'm 23
Like I'm 23, Yeah I'm 23
