[Intro]
Ay
Yung Pricetag back in this bitch with another single
Yuh, ay
You already know your guy got co-signed
Yuh, Koji on the track
Yuh, ay, yuh yuh, ay

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning like "Bruh I'm feeling lazy" (Yuh)
And I bet yo bitch want me to fuck her crazy (Yuh)
I think my choppa think you said "I want that guy to spray me" (Yuh)
Break yo friend ankle with ripstik (Yuh)
I sent yo bitch a dick pic
Yuh
My grandpa think you a nitwit (What?)
Don't fuck with me or my twin bitch (Yuh)

[Hook]
Yuh (x7)

[Verse 2]
Pricetag been the shit since the fucking 80s
Like my neanderthal cousins, I steal your ladies
High up off these fumes so I guess I'm kinda wavy

[Outro]
Don't fuck with my twin
I might make ya jaw spin
Acting all, stupid, I might do it again
Bentley or Benz, whichever I'm in got a bitch and her friends
