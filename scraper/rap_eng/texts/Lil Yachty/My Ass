[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Ohhhhhh
It's Lil Boat

[Rahmeen]
Lately I've been feeling kinda wavy
Lately I've been feeling kinda wavy
Lately I've been feeling kinda wavy
Take a week to leave sick for days, it's crazy

[Verse: Lil Yachty]
These niggas mad at Lil Boat
I'm tryna figure out why
I put my wrists in the sky
Watch it go bling, you go blind, damn
I give a fuck bout a nigga
You know I never give a fuck what they say
I eat on Versace plates
I got your bitch in my place, damn

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Ohhh, I'mma stack my cheddar
I realized money gets these bitches wetter
Cause money make the world go round
Yeah, money make the world go round
Ohhh, I'mma stack this cheddar
I realized money get all these bitches wetter
Money make the world go round
Money make the world go round
It make it go round

[Verse: Rahmeen]
Old friends start to hit me up again
I wonder what they wanting from me
All the syrup at the crib, but we ain't got no pancakes
It's kinda funny
Been a long time stacking all my guap
But now my pockets feeling chubby
Money raining on this side
We don't ever like to see it sunny
Watch the way I move my wrists like a belly dancer
In the lab, cooking up like I'm curing cancer
I was working, no I'm never fucking stopping
Cause they only care about you when you're fucking popping, yeah
So I ain't gonna chase these hoes
Rather chase the money and watch 'em line up in rows
Rather chase the money and watch 'em line up at shows
Cause money make the world go round, so

[Hook: Lil Yachty and Rahmeen]
Ohhh, I'mma stack my cheddar
I realized money gets these bitches wetter
Cause money make the world go round
Yeah, money make the world go round
Ohhh, I'mma stack this cheddar
I realized money get all these bitches wetter
Money make the world go round
Money make the world go round
It make it go round

[Outro: Rahmeen]
Yeah, I'm bout to turn up for a check
Yeah, I'm bout to turn up for a check
Late nights turn to early mornings, we don't get no rest, yeah
Late nights turn to early mornings, we don't get no rest
