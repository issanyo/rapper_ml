[Intro - Lil' Yachty + Rahmeen]

Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!
Ohh! Oh-ohhhhhh!
It's Lil' Boat

Lately, I've been feeling kinda wavy
Lately, I've been feeling kinda wavy
Lately, I've been feeling kinda wavy
Take a week to leave sick for days. It's crazy

[Verse 1 - Lil' Yachty]

These niggas mad at Lil' Boat
I'm tryna figure out why
I put my wrists in the sky
Watch it go bling, you go blind. Damn!
I give a fuck bout a nigga
You know I never give a fuck what they say
I eat on Versace plates
I got your bitch in my place. Damn!

[Hook - Lil Yachty]

Ahhh! I'mma stack my cheddar
I realized money gets these bitches wetter
'Cause money make the world go round
Yeah! Money make the world go round

Ahhh! I'mma stack this cheddar
I realized money get all these bitches wetter
Money make the world go round
Money make the world go round
Go round
Go round
Yeah! It make it go round

[Verse 2 - Rahmeen]

Old friends start to hit me up again
I wonder what they wantin' from me
All the syrup at the crib--
But we ain't got no pancakes. It's kinda funny
Been a long time. Stackin' all my guwop
But now my pockets feelin' chubby
Money rainin' on this side
We don't ever like to see it sunny

Watch the way I move my wrists like a belly dancer
In the lab cooking up like I'm curing cancer
I was working. No, I'm never fuckin' stoppin'--
'Cause they only care about you when you're fuckin' poppin'

So I ain't gonna chase these hoes
Rather chase the money and watch'em line up in rows
Rather chase the money and watch'em line up at shows
'Cause money make the world go round. So--

[Hook - Lil' Yachty + Rahmeen]

Ahhh! I'mma stack my cheddar
I realized money gets these bitches wetter
'Cause money make the world go round
Yeah! money make the world go round

Ahhh! I'mma stack this cheddar
I realized money get all these bitches wetter
Money make the world go round
Money make the world go round
Go 'round
Go 'round
Yeah! It make it go round

[Outro - Rahmeen]

Yeah! I'm 'bout to turn up for a check
Yeah! I'm 'bout to turn up for a check
Late nights turn to early mornings. We don't get no rest. Yeah!
Late nights turn to early mornings. We don't get no rest
