[Verse 1]
I can’t fuck with all the fakers
Now or later I’ll be cakin’
Elevator to the top floor
Suck and fuck her now she top blow
Suckin’ dick like I’m castro
I’m the nigga with the cash flows
I got bitches up in North Dakota
I got bitches up in North Dakota

[Hook?]
Please don’t tell me that you rockin’
Please don’t tell me that we gang
Cooking up crack in my lane
Bagging the dimes in my Wang
All these fuck niggas is stains
All these fuck niggas is corny
Might drop the clip in this hoe
Cause little bitches starting to bore me

[Verse 2]
All these little hoes they adore me
Bel Air white bitch look like dorky
She fucking just for some Jordans
But I can’t cop for no bitch
She swerved and I’m gon’ flip the switch
I put that hoe in the sport
I copped a crib with a court
Stop flexing you ain’t in no force

[Interlude]
Little bitch, know what I’m saying?
Niggas got shit fucked up
Know what I’m saying?
I’m the youngest nigga walking around this bitch
Know what I’m saying?
You gon’ know me when you fuckin see me nigga
You knew me before you know me you dig?
Know what I’m saying?
The nigga with the braids, the red hair all that shit
The flyest motherfucker in here
I’m probably textin’ your bitch right now

[Hook]
Please don’t tell me that you rockin’
Please don’t tell me that we gang
Cooking up crack in my lane
Bagging the dimes in my Wang
All these fuck niggas is stains
All these fuck niggas is corny
Might drop the clip in this hoe
Cause little bitches starting to bore me

[Verse 3]
These little bitches starting to bore me
All these little hoes getting boring
That’s why Yachty started touring
That’s why I be be driving foreigns
Hey, hey, alright
These little bitches they got me high
Why you come if you not sucking cock?
Why these niggas be thinkin’ they bloods?
All my bloods turn they block to a flood
He was tough ‘til he saw what it was
All my gang on that gunplay and stuff (What up?)
All my niggas look rugged as fuck
All my life I been jugging for bucks
Fuck a job, I can’t work for no nigga
So I block post to stack up the figures
Columbine shawty, that’s me
I put the hole in his teeth
I put the hole in his teeth
I ran a block with the heat
Put a few caps in his feet
Make him jump rope to the beat
I fuck his bitch with no hezzo
Yachty, I might run for prezzo
