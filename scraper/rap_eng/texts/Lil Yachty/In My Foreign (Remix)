[Intro: Lil Yachty]
The Americanos

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & French Montana]
Do you wanna ride, ride, ride in my foreign, in my foreign?
Lift the top back all the way, rolling through the streets of LA
Girl, do you wanna ride, ride, ride in my foreign, in my foreign?
We can turn up the radio, we ain't got no place to go
Girl, do you wanna ride?
Montana, haann

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Fo' sho' she wanna ride, fo' sho' she wanna slide
Fo' sho' we gettin' sauced, fo' sho' we gettin' high
Pull up swaggin', hop out the wagon
Suckers gonna hate but the ladies wanna brag
What you say? What you say? What you say?
Whole team faded like Jordan with the J
Cradle to the grave, NY to the Bay
Millions in the bank and the hunnids in the safe
Ain't nothing to a G, baby
Foreign sitting low, climb out the V, baby
Haan, ain't nothing to a G, baby
Foreign sitting low climb out the V, baby

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Do you wanna ride, ride, ride in my foreign, in my foreign?
Lift the top back all the way, rolling through the streets of LA
Girl, do you wanna ride, ride, ride in my foreign, in my foreign?
We can turn up the radio, we ain't got no place to go

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl it feels like Saturday, everyday
I'm smoking loud and feeling so high
I'm rolling good through my hood
Getting lit like the 4th of July

[Verse 2: Nicky Jam]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've been missing you
Telling all my friends 'bout the things that you do
Baby, I don't know what you did to me
Every time I pull up is dale mami
Do you wanna ride?
Tell your girl come slide and we can get lit tonight
Yeah, yeah, I ain't gotta tell you how it is
Baby, I'mma give you the biz
How you wanna roll in the Lambo on the road
'Cause you know that Papi got flow

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Do you wanna ride, ride, ride in my foreign, in my foreign?
Lift the top back all the way, rolling through the streets of LA
Girl, do you wanna ride, ride, ride in my foreign, in my foreign?
We can turn up the radio, we ain't got no place to go
Girl, do you wanna ride?

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
You should bring your homie, I'll bring one, too
I know you like the spotlight, so let me introduce you
Just me and you, parked up at the top, looking at the view
So many things that we could do, just ride with me, you'll never lose
Do you wanna ride in my foreign, get your red-bottom heels, no Jordans
I know your ex-boyfriend was hella boring
Now we skurting 130, no snoring

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Do you wanna ride, ride, ride in my foreign, in my foreign?
Lift the top back all the way, rolling through the streets of LA
Girl, do you wanna ride, ride, ride in my foreign, in my foreign?
We can turn up the radio, we ain't got no place to go
Girl do you wanna ride?
