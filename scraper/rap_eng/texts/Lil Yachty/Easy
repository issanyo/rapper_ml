Tell me how you did it, let a nigga get some knowledge
(Let a nigga know!)
How you so respected, how you keep it so solid?
(Woah oh-woah!)

[Chrous]
I could let you know but that shit easy
(It's so easy)
How I made that million that shit easy
(Ohhh, it's so easy)
How I fucked that bitch that shit so easy
(Dam that shit easy)

(Lil Boat!)
It's easy, It's easy !
(Lil Boat!)

[Verse One: Lil Yachty]
I ain't really for that he say she say
You gon' here the hook and hit that replay
This is not a race, this not relay
Niggas stop the acting this not T.V!
I just touched-down in the Noya eating beignets (yeah)
Everything I do go viral call me Kanye
For us to date you gotta stunt just like Beyonce
Or maybe look as good as Zendaya
Boat from 97 been a true play (yeah)
6 bands on the pants cause they alligator

[Verse Two: Duwap Kaine]
It's really funny how I run my check up
Diamonds on a nigga watch how I flex up
Choppa hit a nigga he gon need a check up
30 on my side I will not be set up!
All this damn guap, I'm the biggest flexer
All my niggas winning, I swear I won't let up
I move all the fucking pounds in the fetti trucks
Never lacking pistol packing keep the semi tucked
Aye, all this fucking purple in my damn cup, aye
All this fucking purple in my damn cup, aye
