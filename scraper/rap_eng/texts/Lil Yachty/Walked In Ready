[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Niggas want beef, want smoke, then I'm ready
Two pistols, two beans, Armageddon
Yeah, walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Niggas want beef, want smoke, then I'm ready
Two pistols, two beans, Armageddon
Uh, yeah, walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Uh, wooh, load it up, load it up
Chopsticks, tote it up
Bullets make 'em open up
Uh, ooh, coupe colored just like a coconut
Woo, tell her anything just to bust a nut
Fuck around, fuck around with them fuck arounds
Pull up, got a hundred round for a whole count
Three rings on like a World Series champ
Thuggin' hard on the internet, get your shirt damp
Nigga neck lit like lamp
Better do the right thing, Spike Lee
Nigga walked in 'bout a hundred deep
Feelin' like Mike T, swingin' at a nigga's teeth
I only pop out every once a while
Niggas love hating every once a while
Fuck a nigga stepdad's main child
All 'cause a young nigga's background

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Niggas want beef, want smoke, then I'm ready
Two pistols, two beans, Armageddon
Yeah, walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Niggas want beef, want smoke, then I'm ready
Two pistols, two beans, Armageddon
Uh, yeah, walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready

[Verse 2: Lil Pump]
Walked in ready, bitch I'm Wocked and ready
Hundred round drum gon' hit you in the belly
My wrist cost more than your mom's new Chevy
Sippin' on wop made my head feel heavy
Wrist so cold, wrist so cold
My neck so froze, feel like the north pole
Trap still jumpin', call me on the metro
Niggas mad at me 'cause I smashed they ho

[Verse 3: JBan$]
Uh, walked in ready
Chopstick, chopstick, been knew how to chef it
Twenty on my wrist, work Audemar Piguet me
Your diamonds look cloudy, I'm shining, I'm flexing
Bitch, lil bitch
I got all these bands in my wrist
I'm poppin', I think I'm the shit
Me and my gangster post up on the six, bitch

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Niggas want beef, want smoke, then I'm ready
Two pistols, two beans, Armageddon
Yeah, walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
Niggas want beef, want smoke, then I'm ready
Two pistols, two beans, Armageddon
Uh, yeah, walked in ready
Walked in ready, I had walked in ready
