[Intro: Quavo]
Yeah, nah mean? Sail Team, dream team, QC, can't believe it
Hm, know you see it

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Put the bitch on the scene
Woke up yesterday dreamin'

I'm ballin', yeah, you wish you seen it
Broke niggas got the cooties

[Chorus: Quavo & J Ban$]
Magical poof (magical poof)

Gas, pills, elbows by the bag, lil' bitch (by the bag, lil' bitch)
All the young niggas know is the trap, lil' bitch (all you niggas know is the trap, ayy)
Runnin' up guap like McFadden, ayy (run up the guap)
Ask J Ban$, bitch, don't ask Madden, ayy
I am the master plan, no
I made the trap Super Saiyan, ayy (woo)
Whippin' and whippin' a bowl, ayy
I'm pinchin' lil' bitches' nose, ayy
32 bands on my gold, ayy
Lil' bitch, my neck is on froze, J Ban$

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty, J Ban$ & Both]
Woah, woah
I had a bitch named Arkeeta, woah
She used to drink Lime-A-Ritas, damn
She was a bad mamacita, woah, ayy, woah, damn
Can't no one fuck with the Boat
Dropped out of school and made more than before, woah
You shoulda seen my new place, $1500 for a Versace vase
Went back to school just to look at their face
As you can tell, I'm a baller
J Ban$ and Boat stick together, that's my brother
And I wouldn't fuck the baddest bitch without a rubber
'Cause these little bitches be sneakin'
All of these niggas be snakes
Why do these niggas be sneakin'?
Ayy, why do these niggas be hatin'?
Ayy, we takin' over the nation
Mad 'cause my diamonds be skatin'
Had to stay down and be patient
