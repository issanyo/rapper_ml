[Verse 1: K$upreme]
Finna make it rumble
Glock 40 make a nigga stumble
Choppa choppa make a nigga crumble
30 clip make a nigga fumble
Hollow tip make a nigga tumble
Big shit all on my hip
Pack came in so we takin' trips
Hit a lick on a silly bitch
I'm on papers
So I can't fuck with no snitch
I dont fuck with 12
Im not going back to jail, I'd rather be in hell
But I'm on life with my gang
And fuck nigga you can't hang
Finna buy rain why these nigga's so strange
We came up with em' as playin'
Dirty dance with the bands its coming, its in my hands
I don't have to fuck with the pots and the pans
New Benjamin

[Verse 2: Ckent]

Easy life alley ooh

Toolin' the dogs with all my dogs
What the vintage [?What the vintage YSL cost? What the Nudies cost? cost, what the nudies cost
Its the deal we can't take a loss
My whole team the boss
Every day I like to floss and I don't check the cost
Im getting it all, I'm running so hard I'm praying to God
And don't check my car
The cops be hating they know I'm a star
I jumped out my car and light me up a big ass cigar
They see starts on my feet aim for the moon and the stars

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
My chain swang heavy SLPs not no Levi's
President evil shawty and I'm coming with that tech 9
Your whole gang sweet I turn your clubhouse into Columbine
You work a nine to five Im trying to be rich for a lifetime
Whole gang with me and they rock like Chris
Mouth shining' hard squint your eyes when they glisten
Gold chain shawty lookin' like a pound of piz
Diamonds dancin' hard its a party on my wrist
Bustin' like a bitch I'm finna move to LA
Youngest nigga dabbin' looking like a straight A
That mean that I'm a hundred Miami when its sunny
Go up north for the winter got a white bitch she ginger
All my bitches call me diddy pop champagne we know party
I just guzzled down a four now I'm gettin' at follies
Youngest nigga in the strip club they don't ask me for ID
Everybody know our gang if you don't nice to meet ya
Two dragon balls for a feature not human born I'm a creature
Lookin' better than ever U-S-R-L sweater
Got these hoes getting wetter
Nature born in the fleece
Leather jacket like Grease
Fucking hard on Patrice
While Im gripping my piece
