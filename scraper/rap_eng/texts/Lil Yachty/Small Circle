[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Droptop ridin' with my droptop shawty
Took that model out the modern then I put her in some Prada
I was on my way she go ass up face down
All my blues be blue now just my bitch and my crew now
Droptop ridin' with my droptop shawty
Took that model out the modern then put her in Prada
I was on my way she go ass up face down
All my bills be blue now just my bitch and my crew now

[Verse: Jban$]
I keep my choppa, I ride 'round with my choppa
I might shoot your block up, cranberry with the vodka yeah
I gotta boot it, all she want is coke
Modelin' that Prada, Gucci, Fendi what she want
I'm in my zone, Jban$ keep three phones
Boost Mobile trappin, servin' niggas what they want
Kush by the cone, kush is my cologne
All I want is dome, fuck her once then leave her lone

Droptop ridin' with my droptop shawty
Took that model out the modern then I put her in some Prada
I was on my way she go ass up face down
All my bands be blue now just my bitch and my crew now
Droptop ridin' with my droptop shawty
Took that model out the modern then put her in Prada
I was on my way she go ass up face down
All my bills be blue now just my bitch and my crew now
