Hey, I know you don't want nothin' to do with me and that's okay, Yeah that's okay
I know you don't want nothin' to do with me, but when I get on please don't reach for your phone
I said, when I get on, please don't reach for your phone
I said, when I get on, please don't reach for your phone
I said, when I get on, please don't reach for your phone

But it's okay, promise I'll be home one day, hey, but
I said, when I get on, please don't reach for your phone
I said, when I get on, please don't reach for your phone

[Verse]
Now, when I count my Ms, don't send no DMs
I said when I count check, bitch don't send me no texts
None of you bitches was to fuck, they want Ciroc, show no love
Stand on any nigga couch give a fuck 'bout clubs
Before I got on, you hoes wasn't rockin', now I ball like John Stockton
Beamer baby, lane switchin', got all these bitches switchin' up
Got 'em thinkin' different, tryna hit my phone
Tryna fuck her somethin', but hell nah, I can't fuck with y'all

[Hook]

I said, when I get on, please don't reach for your phone
I said, when I get on, please don't reach for your phone
I said, when I get on, please don't reach for your phone
I said, when I get on, please don't reach for your phone
But it's okay, promise I'll be home one day, hey, but
When I get on, please don't reach for your phone
I said, when I get on, please don't reach for your phone
