[Intro: Lil Yachty & Nakuu]
Yo what's poppin' nigga, it's Lil Boat in this motherfucker
Ayy yo bro flex real quick, tell 'em how you came up
Youngin' really got that shit off the boat
I was born on a boat motherfucker, I came up on a boat
Thirty thousand dollars on my neck
Nigga we flexin', can't forget the wrist
Fifty thousand, you know what I'm sayin', on my wrist
Niggas know how I'm comin', niggas know how I'm flexin'

[Hook: Nakuu]
Pull up, flex

Tell my city I'm next
Watch me, flex

Bad bitch looking real pretty
Niggas know me and my city
Pull up, flex
Young nigga need that check
Had to switch in a new lane

[Verse 1: Nakuu]
Look at me, I'm turning up, woah

Me and Lil Boat stay one hunnid

Hop in the foreign, I know that they mad
We getting shit that they wishin' they had
Trapping and selling and moving it fast
Niggas be hating but I feel the glad in it
If I'm with lil shawty you know that she bad
No other way, I do not play
Go by the rules, [?] shake
Can't talk if it's not about a peso
Young nigga tryna get a bankroll
You a fake nigga, we don't play those

Promise you don't what the money talk do
Promise you don't what the money talk do

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Sack when I run up
Try to take my sack then we fuck 'em
Fire cap and shells to your noggin
Big booty latin bitch what I'm knockin'
I'm bustin' twat like a bag of new chips
Shout out Y-6 and Lil Duke, them my crips
Bitch feelin' left 'cause I took her on a trip
Bitch I fuck then I dip
Can't drink the drink without a full zip, huh
She lick the tip then she gobble the rest
I'm Fifty Cent with a [Vlone] bullet vest
Thirty-six diamonds tango on my neck
Watch how I flex
Cut the check with the ones I know best
Stay outta mess, I flip the waters
And I ball like young nigga Vince Carter
Fuck around and might nut on your daughter
Ain't nope, I just wanna
Lil Boat, I was born on a boat
Twenty thousand dollars just for a show
Drink purple like I bang for Saint Row
I might finesse you, that's how the game goes bitch
Lil bitch, you look like you finna snitch
Thirty thousand on my wrist
Goddamn I'm the shit
Lil Boat
