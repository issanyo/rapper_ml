[Verse 1: Zoey Dollaz]
Told the bitch eat that, I'm sendin' cheap threats
I demand respect, Audemars Piguet
Drip on 'em, key sweat
Haters new, he next
RIP Jah, X (X!)
[?]
Treat the roof like it's BMX, dog on old DMX
Tired of niggas hatin' us, make girl lick nuts
Count money paper cuts, [?]
Rap niggas fake as fuck, they know not to play with us nigga (Uh)
Fuck 12, we ain't pull the trigger
Oh, naw, for real though, like fuck 12, we really pull triggers (Uh)
If a nigga ever kill me, don't you cry nigga
Better kill his kids, make that nigga cry nigga (Uh)
Count up with my slime, might just call my nigga Thugger
Give a fuck she bad, I'm still putting on a rubber

Count up with my slime, become rich (Brrr, brrr)
Count up with my slime, become rich (Yee, yee)
Count up with my slime, become rich

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I'm a big dog, young as hell, rich as fuck
FNM, gold bullets, keep 'em tucked
Red dot, perfect aim, double dutch
Bently coupe on auto, I don't need no clutch
Bought my bitch a clutch, bought my bitch a butt
Said, "you heard I'm talkin' shit", who with such and such
I'm, with slime, in the back, he'll switch your guts
Only say it once, I don't sucker punch
Keep that shit you was sayin' on the internet
Pillow talkin' to a bitch, I ain't into that
Sent some bullets, don't worry we gon' send 'em back
Young Rich Nigga throw a party, in the centermax

[Chorus: Zoey Dollaz]
Count up with my slime, become rich (Huh, rich)
Count up with my slime, become rich (Slime, rich, huh)
Count up with my slime, become rich (Rich, fww)
Count up with my slime, become rich (Slime, slime, brrr!)
Count up with my slime, become rich (Lil purpp)
Count up with my slime, become rich (Brrr, brrr)
Count up with my slime, become rich (Yee, yee)
Count up with my slime, become rich

[Verse 3: Smokepurpp]
Become rich, choppa got a lot of kick
Better not lick

[Chorus: Zoey Dollaz]
Count up with my slime, become rich (Huh, rich)
Count up with my slime, become rich (Slime, rich, huh)
Count up with my slime, become rich (Rich, fww)
Count up with my slime, become rich (Slime, slime, brrr!)
Count up with my slime, become rich (Lil purpp)
Count up with my slime, become rich (Brrr, brrr)
Count up with my slime, become rich (Yee, yee)
