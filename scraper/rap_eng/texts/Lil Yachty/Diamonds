[Hook: Lil Yachty]
My diamonds twinkle, water sprinkle
Niggas hate I made it so fast
I don't even know but it's cool though
Ballin' hard, you can check my finger roll
I'm a rich nigga, you can check my meat roll
Diamonds twinkle, water sprinkle
Niggas hate I made it so fast
I don't even know but it's cool though
Ballin' hard, you can check my finger roll
I'm a rich nigga, you can check my meat roll

My bitch like baby the baddest
I cannot hang with a thottie
My nigga, my possé ride 'round with a shotty, yeah
Know what this lil bitch mean, yeah
Why she keep callin' on me? yeah
Red dot, know that's the beam
Rob your whole team, spend it on Supreme, yeah
Got some lean for my new hoes 'cause we riding, yeah
Fendi bag for my sidebitch, don't try it, yeah
I got water on me, my diamonds Poseidon, yeah
I go thirty in that coupe, they know we sliding

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Twenty-thousand, I just made it
Hundred bitches 'round me waitin'
I don't even know why they mad at me
Hah, I remember they used to laugh at me
Now when I'm in town for a show they hit my phone for a pass
But no
Pay your ticket like everybody else
Old ass rappers hang it up on the shelf
Hating on me 'cause I'm doing my thing
Fuck you two times, gettin' it by all means
