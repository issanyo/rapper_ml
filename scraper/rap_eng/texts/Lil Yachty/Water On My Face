Is it recording? Alright, hahah

[Hook]
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
My whip dripping, too much candy in my paint
Bitches they love RD
They watch me, they love me, they need me like nicotine
Fresher than most, straight off the boat
Counting my dough
Just a red head boy from the city, Versace robe
On me like I'm Diddy
One hand on her titty
Other gripping money
Lifes so sweet right now
Better lock down your hoe
Before I come through your town
Living so profound
Watch them hate me now
Bitches used to talk down
Now they ride like Greyhound
They ride like greyhounds cause I did 'em in and out

[Hook]
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I be loaded, too many pistols on my waist
Let a fuck nigga try me, find me a skrrt
I'ma go, I'ma go straight to his house
Gold on my mouth
Coming straight from the south
Me, I look pop right now
Water dripping, someone give me a towel
Man I took off, someone gave me a roll
Good lean when I fuck on yo hoe
Shout out to Roll, that's my big bro
Who is these niggas? Man, nobody knows
Nigga get mad, I put dick in his hoe
Wrap it up, body bagging his hoe, hoe, woah

[Hook]
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face

[Outro]
And it's too much water
Dripping, man it's too much water
Splash, too much water
We too fly, dripping too much water
Too much sauce, we dripping too much water
Lil Yachty drip too much water
Your hoe tryna drink my water
