Lyrics from Snippet

[Chrous]
I wrote this song to tell you how I feel
Oh the feeling is too real
Don't give a fuck bout your apparel I wanna peel
At first they was cool cause you promised a sequel
It's all for you, It's all for you, all for you, It's all for you
Girl there's gotta be another way
I wrote this song for you, I wrote it for you, all for you
I promise I do
