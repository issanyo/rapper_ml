[Hook X2: Sean Garrett]
I know you're so tired of my lying
I done fucked up again but I'm trying
You know the nigga in me gon' deny it
Just gon' tell her the same like ain't shit gon' change
But I looked in your face

[Verse 1: Sean Garrett]
I swear to God I love her
Damn God I love her
She princess cut
She pretty, thick, and gutta
She my mothafucka
Every time she drip I lick her butter
Why I'm such a fuck up
Told her I was hoopin' with my brotha
I was with Yolanda
She said she ready for a baby
I ain't really ready for a baby
I know at this point that's the only thing gon' make her stay
I guess I'm fucked either way
Now any other time I got caught I would gone and give her 3 days to cool off
Pull up to the house pull her legs all way back
Give her that stare while I dig, dig

[Hook X2: Sean Garrett]
I know you're so tired of my lying
I done fucked up again but I'm trying
You know the nigga in me gon' deny it
Just gon' tell her the same like ain't shit gon' change
But I looked in your face

[Verse 2: Sean Garrett]
I tell you how much I love you
You say I don't give no fucks
But you don't understand to have you what a nigga gave up
That's maybe why I can't get enough
I promise on my momma I'd have gave everything  to be true
But what a young nigga gon' do
Don't you see him when I pull up
Hear this go up
That shit represent a come up
Making bitches nut up
That's just what a boss nigga do

Don't I do, don't I lick you right
Don't I dick you down
Don't I take care of you
Suck you dry till the lights go down
Then I give you 3 days to cool off
Pull up to the house pull her legs all way back
Give her that stare while I dig, dig

[Hook X2: Sean Garrett]
I know you're so tired of my lying
I done fucked up again but I'm trying
You know the nigga in me gon' deny it
Just gon' tell her the same like ain't shit gon' change
But I looked in your face

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
I know I'm doing you wrong
That's why I buy everything that you put on
That don't make it right but that tear down the hype
I do not like to fight I just lay down the pipe
Pick up my call when I call you on Skype
I fucked her one time but that was one night
None of these bitches my type
No, that's why I put you on the flight, yeah
Cause lying to you when I'm wrong when I know you're right makes me feel weak
Kissing all on your neck and all down your spine you know that I'ma  freak
And that new dress fit you so sweet
Your new hairdo so unique
That's why I sweep you off your feet
And throw you straight into the sheets

Fuck me, like you mad at me
Fuck me, like you ain't seen me in a minute
Fuck me, fuck me because you stuck with me
I'll give you my all

[Hook X2: Sean Garrett]
I know you're so tired of my lying
I done fucked up again but I'm trying
You know the nigga in me gon' deny it
Just gon' tell her the same like ain't shit gon' change
But I looked in your face
