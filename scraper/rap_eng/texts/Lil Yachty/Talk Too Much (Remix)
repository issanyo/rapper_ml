[Hook: OG Maco]
All these hoes talk too much
Baby, you be silent
Baby, are you ridin'?
Tell a nigga if you slidin'
Cause all these hoes talk too much
Baby, you be silent
Baby, you alright?
Tell a nigga if you slidin'

All these hoes talk too much
All these hoes act too much
Switchin' up, switchin up, hey
Switchin' up, switchin up, hey
She eat on that pussy like cake

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Why you always talk too much?
If you listen then you learn
Niggas only get what they earn
Keep on talkin', we gon' put you in an urn
All my bridges burn, no longer concern
Whoa whoa whoa
You been watchin' way too much
You been watchin' way too much
You been watchin' way too much
You niggas can't break me
Next check I just might cop an AP
Lil Boat!
Lil Boat!

[Outro: OG Maco]
Finna get a job
