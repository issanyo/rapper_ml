Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Thanks, Ugly God

[Chorus: Ugly God]
I call a flight with your wife
I spent that price on my ice
She say, my diamonds on fleek
I pull up and fuck up her life
Watch how I thumb, through these bands
Now these hoes wanna be nice
All of these bitches is trife
Bitch, get the fuck out my life

[Verse 1: Ugly God]
Now, that my name big on a banner
Bitch, look at my glamour, my middle name tanner
Fuck Donald Trump, 'cause I trap Bernie Sanders
Talk down on me, you'll get hurt for the slander
I got your bitch and she wet like a tidal wave
Run up on me and I might take your life away
I bust a nut in your microwave
Bitch, I'm the shit, I stay lit like a fireplace
I'm Ugly God and I'm the undertaker, I'ma find your bitch and I'ma funnel cake her
Bitch, I'm rich, I got a ton of paper, I'ma fuck your bitch and get her number later
But wait, all of these bitches want cake, all of these niggas is snakes
I'll take your bitch to my place, I'll knock it down and I'll shake

[Chorus: Ugly God]
I call a flight with your wife
I spent that price on my ice
She say, my diamonds on fleek
I pull up and fuck up her life
Watch how I thumb, through these bands
Now these hoes wanna be nice
All of these bitches is trife
Bitch, get the fuck out my life

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Hunnid grand for my initials
I'm not the one the one with the pistols
So I'm not the one you be watching
I'm [?], like the watchmen
Everyone is a lame, [?], like I'm undercover
Grab the shit, in the bag, break it up, fuck the cops
It's yellow time, fuck a funk shine, got a mini fridge full of rave
She [?], like it's ring
She wanna fuck on the team
Got a bad bitch from the Southside, all a nigga hear is "ring, ring"
So all she hear is "ching, ching"
And all she want is bling, bling
Lil' Boat

[Chorus: Ugly God]
I call a flight with your wife
I spent that price on my ice
She say, my diamonds on fleek
I pull up and fuck up her life
Watch how I thumb, through these bands
Now these hoes wanna be nice
All of these bitches is trife
Bitch, get the fuck out my life
