[Verse 1]
Loosie, doosie, the jokes on you, I didn't grow up to Boosie
All I care about is feeding my family and getting out of that Camry
I'm in a Benz and I'm getting a Bentley
I'm reading texts from last night, she said "I love how you bent me"
I just bought a Benz and it said "please tint me"
You wanna buy it but you can't
So you're renting, you'll take it back in 6 months
If there's no denting
7K for the for VVS, white diamond dentals
They say "Yachty are you the nigga with the jingle bell rap?"
I'm cool with that, cause every bitch look at my jingle balls now, I fool with that
I finger roll the ABA in
Top floor, penthouse where I'm staying
I grew up watching Even Stevens
Now Steven ain't nearly as even
But I want to thank you for the entertainment that evening
Yeah, we all laughed at you
'Cause we all know you wouldn't say that if you saw me on your avenue
We all know you aren't built for this shit
I was taught "don't you dare buck if you can't back up your shit"
Every time I wake up, someone new is back on my dick
I used to get baffled, now I sit back and laugh like a bitch
Young as fuck and rich as hell, I can't get mad at this shit

[Interlude]
Hold up, let me change the topic real quick

[Verse 2]
We got a fallen soldier on the internet
Don't believe my net worth on the Internet
It's a lot larger, my dream girl's ex boyfriend drive a Charger
So I know I got a chance with that chick
I used dream about bitches who love all this shit
I used to dream about girls who love all the dick
I used to wear gold so fake, now I iced up the wrist
Hold up, aye, uh, aye, uh
Funkmaster Flex please stop talkin' 'bout me
Unless you're finna play my songs then don't talk about me
Uhm, old man, here's a bar
I hope you fall into a hole where there's no sun or stars

[Outro]
Uh, hold on, aye, uh, uh, aye, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
I'm gonna stop, stop, stop, stop
I'm gonna stop
