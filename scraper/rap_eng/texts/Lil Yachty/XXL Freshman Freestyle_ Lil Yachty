[Verse]
Hey mama, I did it! I'm finally here!
Diamonds on my neck cost a 60, plus a cool 5
Chickens lined up in the kitchen like Kentucky drive
Brother on my side, on his hip, that's a 4-5
Never a bum, I rather Hi-Tech over rum
You dap me up, I know you see me shining from pinky finger to thumb
We having traffic, I cause static up in the attic like Dish network
I'm top floor by the bluest shore
That's Lil Boat with the biggest ego, flyer than a seagull
Every time you see me out you know it's a movie like Regal
Cinema, Lil Chrissy, that's my photographer
Lil Boat, he going very far, burnin' up like Sean Paul
Lil Boat!
