[Intro: Slimesito]
Earl the Pearll
My boy Earl Pearll do beats

[Verse 1: Slimesito]
I'm in the trap and I'm paranoid (Paranoid)
In the streets, I'm undefeated like Floyd (Ay)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Drive the new Maybach all over the course (Skrt)

I got like three different bank accounts (Yeah)
You hide your shit in a shoebox, oh, that's cool
These niggas fools (Woo)
I'm so damn rich I could buy me a school (For real)
I’m a young nigga havin’ sex with your sister
Beat her back out, make her leave in a stretcher (Fuck it up)
My diamonds skate like a young Ryan Sheckler
My bro a bully, call him a heckler
We is not regular
Two thousand spent on my cellular (Hey)
Free my cuz Reese out the cell gang (Hey)
Standin’ outside ’til the mail came, yeah (Hey, hey)

[Verse 4: Slimesito]
Slime, ay (Ooh)

I’m in the trap with real killers (Gang)
I’m protected, walkin’ around with gorillas (Gang)
All black in the hood, I look like a ninja (Ay)
Pistol on me everywhere that I’m chillin’
Off of all these drugs, I’m losin’ my feelings (Drugs)
A lot of problems, but you know I ain’t trippin’
A lot of killers with me, you know I ain’t trippin’ (Ay)
Nigga say he drippin’, but he pretendin’ (Drippin’)
I don’t care about no fuckin’ stains (Nah)
Real shit, man, I still don’t respect it

I’m from the trenches where that shit get reckless (Gangway)
A lot of ammunition, you know I’m protected (Grra)
Wipe a nigga nose for all of that flexin’ (Slime)
He was in debt so I had to collect it
