[Verse: Lil Yachty]
You know that she licks (skrt!)
Nigga, she took back, and she thinking her rims (shyeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I came from nothing, now I ghost ride the coupe
You niggas bluffin', y'all don't do what y'all say (no)
Where is the money? Please point me that way (where?)
It's QC 'til I OD, I'ma say that every day

[Chorus: Takeoff]
Bad bitch, small waist, pretty face (pretty)
Havin' my way (have it, have it)
She let me nut on her face (blargh)
Stay in your place (stay in your), shut up and stay out the way (shut up)
Decided what I'm gonna do today, I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith, I wanna look at the stars today (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Ghost), I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith, thinkin' 'bout coppin' that thang today (skrt)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Ghost), I'ma ghost ride the Wraith
