[Hook: Dean Blunt]
Twenty bands, twenty bands, twenty bands
Twenty bands, twenty bands, twenty bands
Twenty bands, twenty bands, twenty bands
Twenty bands, twenty bands, twenty bands

[Verse 1: Dean Blunt]
Let it out, let it out, let it out
Boy, what you cryin' about?
Every boy got a problem with me
Don't see things how I see
I don't know what they askin' of us
Everyone got a question for us
Can they give a nigga privacy?
What is that? Where is he? Who is she?
Where is that? Who is he? What is she?
Who is that? What is he? Where is she?

[Hook: Dean Blunt]
Twenty bands, twenty bands, twenty bands
Twenty bands, twenty bands, twenty bands
Twenty bands, twenty bands, twenty bands

[Verse 2: Dean Blunt]
Twenty bands, what a cause to start
Twenty bands said this one's gonna flop
Twenty bands, everyone's gonna see
Twenty bands, they'll send for me
Twenty bands got me up in the sky
Twenty bands got me higher than a kite
Twenty bands got me cryin' inside
Twenty bands, twenty bands, twenty bands
Twenty bands, twenty bands, twenty
I don't know what you askin' of me
Got a nigga goin' crazy
Get these White girls out of my home

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Ten bands, ten bands
Money bags, money bags, money bags
Money bags, money bags (remix!)
Ten bands, ten bands
Ten bands, ten bands
Ricky [?]
Saint Laurents on me, I don't wear vans
She think her nigga talking [?] when you're [?] fame
All these niggas fiends, starin' at they-
Lil Boat be the goat cause I got others poppin' Xans
Choker chain shining [?] like what's the plan?
These niggas not [?]
Somebody doesn't give it back
On my bread, on my chain, on my guap
If I can get it, then it's off, where to start?
Money bags, money bags, money bags, money bags
Ten bands, ten bands, ten bands

[Bridge: Dean Blunt]
Pour some liquor, on my head
Money bags, money bags
Twenty bands, twenty bands

[Skit]
