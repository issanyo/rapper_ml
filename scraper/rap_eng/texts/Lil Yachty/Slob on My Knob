[Intro: Lil Yachty]
You a pussy fuck nigga
That's why i fucked yo' hoe
You a bonified bitch nigga
Hang around with them snitch niggas
Don't come to my hood the 6 block where I ditch niggas

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I just stole a 18 karat diamond from your girl
N.A.Z against the world
Niggas talk crazy run up on his moms at the store
Hit her with the AK
Watch her brains hit the floor
Pull up gang galore
Raw dog a bitch
Give a fuck bout a whore
Bad little bitch she came straight from Singapore
And she wrap bricks better than my Asian whore
Diamond rings on me got me feel like Mike Tyson 99's world tour
I could never give a fuck I said that shit straight from the core
I remember when a nigga ass was dead poor
Now I bust jugs and make more money than before
Big bad wolf and this bitch kicking down your door
All these niggas washed up I found them on the shore

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Fee
Fi
Fo
Fum
I just want the dollars
I can't fuck with no nigga I just want my guala
I said I just fucked a bitch and all the neighbors heard her hollar
Tried to fuck with college  but Lil Yachty ain't a scholar
I said I just want the dollars
I just want the dollars nigga
