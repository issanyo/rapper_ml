[Intro]
Yeah, Harry Fraud and Lil Boat
(live life and be happy)
Nights like this get remembered forever (live life and be happy)
Nights like this get remembered forever  (live life and be happy)
Nights like this get remembered forever and ever and ever
(be happy)

[Chorus]
See these bitches, they Yatchy's angels
And I got stripes just like a bengal
K$upreme pour an eighth in a Faygo
Keep my circle tight, shit's smaller than a bagel
See these bitches, they Yatchy's angels
And I got stripes just like a bengal
K$upreme pour an eighth in a Faygo
Keep my circle tight, shit's smaller than a bagel

[Verse 1]
It's Lil Boat, the youngest nigga in charge
I fucked on your broad, I see why you mad
I take care of my mine
Make sure that my brother's straight, make sure that my mama's good
Get her up out the hood
Take her to a finer place, where she see brighter days
Ain't go to worry 'bout bills gettin' paid, no
I put that on my life, yeah
I can never love a bitch, can't have no wife, yeah
Nothin' permanent, so I live life like tomorrow is my last day, yeah

[Chorus]
See these bitches, they Yatchy's angels
And I got stripes just like a bengal
K$upreme pour an eighth in a Faygo
Keep my circle tight, shit's smaller than a bagel
See these bitches, they Yatchy's angels
And I got stripes just like a bengal
K$upreme pour an eighth in a Faygo
Keep my circle tight, shit's smaller than a bagel
