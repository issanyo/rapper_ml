[Intro: Lil Yachty]
I'm attracted to outgoing women
Someone who can provide
Someone who doesn't depend on anyone else
Someone who can just do anything

[Verse 1: Leaf]
All my bitches look like models (ooh)
Drinking Henny out the bottle (ooh)
Your bitch calling me her father, papi
All that talking I hear nada
Nothing

[Hook: Leaf]
When every nigga want you
All that money come through
All these haters acting reckless
But what the fuck they gon’ do?
They won’t do nada
All these haters won’t do nada
All my bitches on cue
Might just run up on you
Tell me what you gon’ do
When we pull come through?
You won’t do nada

[Refrain: Leaf]
When I pull up won’t do nada
They don’t do nada
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
Ask what them want say nada
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
When niggas talking all that
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
It’ll get back to me mañana
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
(Just watch)

[Verse 2: Leaf]
I ain't gon' trip
I’ma sit back and sip
Watch it roll off your lips
Bitch like me
Heard you was talking shit
But won’t say it to my face
Here we go
Didn't niggas let you know
I ain't one to let shit go
Young OG
You don’t want nada from me
You don’t want nothing from me

[Refrain]
They don’t do nada
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
Ask what them want say nada
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
You niggas talking alright
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
It’ll get back to me mañana
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
(Just watch)

[Hook: Leaf]
When every nigga want you
All that money come through
All these haters acting reckless
But what the fuck they gon’ do?
They won’t do nada
All these haters won’t do nada
All my bitches on cue
Might just run up on you
Tell me what you gon’ do
When we pull come through?
You won’t do nada
When I pull up won’t do nada

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
All these haters talking shit
Doing it on the internet
I don’t see why they’re talking shit
If talking shit don’t benefit
See me, I'm all 'bout paper though
They don’t want real smoke
They’re more like vapers
I said farewell to my haters
Like Kobe said to the Lakers
I need a mansion on an acre
Somewhere north of Decatur
With a bad bitch who love to cook my taters
All my, all my niggas, all my niggas, on go for Boat
Aimin' at your nose, pointed at your throat

[Hook: Leaf]
When every nigga want you
All that money come through
All these haters acting reckless
But what the fuck they gon’ do?
They won’t do nada
All these haters won’t do nada
All my bitches on cue
Might just run up on you
Tell me what you gon’ do
When we pull come through?
You won’t do nada
When I pull up won’t do nada

[Refrain: Leaf]
They don’t do nada
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
Ask what them want say nada
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
You niggas talking alright
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
It’ll get back to me mañana
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
(Just watch)
