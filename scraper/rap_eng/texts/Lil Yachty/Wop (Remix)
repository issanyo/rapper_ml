[Intro: Lil Keed]
You know I just copped this YSL piece, you know what I'm sayin'
No cap

Ayy where you get that beat from? Mooktoven
Keed, talk to 'em

[Chorus: Lil Keed]
I got shooters so I hope a nigga ain't on nothin' (Wop)
Me and big slime fuckin' these hoes, nah, we ain't cuffin' nothin' (Wop, wop)
I got cheese on me wrapped in saran (Wop)
What's that floatin' 'round that Crush? Man, that's all Xans (Wop)
Foreign ho just wanna embrace, she don't need no weave (Wop, wop)
Water on my neck and wrist, yeah, Dasani (Wop)
You can picture this right now, ain't talking Sony (Wop)
Black pitchfork, that's that Masi'
Yeah, I did it from the ground up

[Verse 1: Lil Keed]
And I just left Bali and I'm smokin', mmh
Naw, they can't be me, these niggas can't see me, nigga stop
Yeah, I pulled up on Bleveland Ave in that drop (Slime)
Yeah, Glock with a dick, yeah, it gon' pop (Boom)
Yeah, I got bad bitches, yeah give me top (Toodles)
Off-White denim on, cost me a lot (No cap)
Off-White shoes, rock them bitches with Gucci socks (Yeah yeah)
They don't wanna see them slimes out, they call the cops (No cap)
Yeah you say you slime, but did your partners slime him out? (Slatt slatt)
I got up, they hands out, but y'all niggas counted me out (Uh-huh)
Any nigga make a sound, I make Stick Baby clear the block (Skrrt)
On the way to these M's, I ain't even do no stops (Uh-uh)
Bust down Rollie, no tick, no tock (Uh-uh)
Nigga was flexing for the day, gotta give it back at 12 o'clock (Uh-huh)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty & Lil Keed]
I got too many hoes to chase a thot bitch (Lil' bitch)
I don't argue with no peon, I just block the bitch (Block the bitch)
I got two Bentleys, paid cash, no lie (Skrrt)
Hit the bitch from the side, she said, "Oh God" (Oh God)
I told Keed he up next, that's on my mama (Slatt)
I got cheese hidin' out just like Osama (Cheese)
With the slimes and they bite just like piranhas (Slimes)
I be ballin' on the block just like Mo Bamba (Woo)
I was 18 in a Benz, not no damn Honda (Skrrt skrrt)
Doin' dash, got me sinnin' in front of your honor (Yeah)
I'm a real nigga, I ain't with the he-say, she-say (And?)
And I'm the new 'Rari, not no Stingray (Keed, talk to 'em)
Lil Boat
