[Chorus: Ferrari Ferrell]
I done fuck my bands up, had to start over
I done fuck my bands up, I had to ride home
Yeah they told that gang stuff you know that slide on me
Yeah they keep a couple guns, but they ain't pulling out, you know wassup
Fuck some bands up, fuck her with gritty hoes
I done fuck some bands up I got to start over
I done fuck some bands up I had to ride home
This some bunch of gutter shit I keep the slide on me

[Verse 1: Ferrari Ferrell]
Yeah we had hella sticks, we was fuckin up

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Better duck from the shells
Break her back just like hell
You niggas gon tell
After 11 I jumped to a teen, cause I do not fuck with twelve
I do not get at you niggas and bitches
Leave his ass with stitches, if he touch my digits
Pull up to the scene, all you hear is crickets
Body went ghost when he saw we wid it
I'm richer now, make a phone call and he'll get you now
Lock down with the same family
Cause all these new niggas be switch around
It's Boat, fresher than scope, gold on my throat
I pledge an oath
To stay on my toes, to stay down with my bro's
I keep a round
Anything that my nigga want he can get it
Cause if I call up my nigga, bet that he let you get it
Loyalty, King of the teens and royalty
Just saw your new girl look like foil b (fake)
Young nigga rich, fucking up the sacks, fucking on your bitch

[Chorus: Ferrari Ferrell]
I done fuck my bands up, had to start over
I done fuck my bands up, I had to ride home
Yeah they told that gang stuff you know that slide on me
Yeah they keep a couple guns, but they ain't pulling out, you know wassup
Fuck some bands up, fuck her with gritty hoes
I done fuck some bands up I got to start over
I done fuck some bands up I had to ride home
This some bunch of gutter shit I keep the slide on me

[Verse 3: Ferrari ferrell]
We on hella shit, on my loopy shit
She said she celibate, why don't we sell a bitch
All we know is bricks, no construction shit

We just real niggas doing real things
Thats a bunch of niggas with some sticks

Nigga pull up make the car flip
Youngin caught a lick and brought me back your shit
Now i'm in the club with yo shit
I just want the money, put my niggas on
But they on that gang, gang, gang shit
Nigga you ain't real, walk in my shoes
Nigga you ain't hard enough
All a nigga wanna [?]
Nigga all you do is act a groupie, wanna roll with them stars and em
Nigga leave you dead, leave your family prayin to the stars and em

[Chorus: Ferrari Ferrell]
I done fuck my bands up, had to start over
