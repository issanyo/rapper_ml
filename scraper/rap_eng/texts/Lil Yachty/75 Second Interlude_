[Intro: Young Thug]
My nigga Wheezy, you know what I'm sayin'

[Verse: Lil Yachty]
These hoes going 'round like a ceiling fan
I might pull up in that pink coat like Killa Cam
In high school, had them black eye peas like â€‹will.i.am
This bitch suck every season like the L.A. Rams
Used to cop from the flea market from Mr. Chan
Bossed up, now them diamonds in my hand
.223s and them AK's might pop ya mans
Niggas biting and they still popping they [?]
I'm the same nigga, ain't shit change nigga
Dark ass tints and wood grain, nigga
In that Range, nigga
I think they mad 'cause I'm on now, bigger homes now (yeah)
3 telephones now can't do a song now (brr, yeah)
And I fuck with Chicago, boy R.I.P LA
I fuck with his little brother, we hung out back in days
[?] back to my old ways
Call them savage niggas who gon' shoot you for some J's
And that bitch run like [?]
And I'm doing shows in arenas
