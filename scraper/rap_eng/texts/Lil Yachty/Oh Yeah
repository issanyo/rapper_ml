[Chorus]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
The moon is beautiful
The sun is even more beautiful
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm cool, super cool
Ladies see me, they drool
Yeah, I act a fool in school
And passed my tests because I'm cool
I'm too cool for you
I could've followed rules
But I didn't 'cause I couldn't
I was busy being cool
I'm too cool for a fool
To try and fool me
When I walk the hall
These ladies call my name from wall to wall
I'm a player, player
Player, player
Player, player
Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's ride

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, I'm too cool
Oh yeah, I'm way too cool
Oh yeah, I'm just too cool
The moon is beautiful, that's right, that's me, baby
The sun is even more beautiful, that is me
Oh yeah, let's ride
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Pocket full of ice
Ice cubes 'cause I'm cool
When I dance, homies wanna do
But they know they can't 'cause I got the moves
Watch me slide to the left
Watch me slide to the right
Keep it cool on the summer night
Take a real then I gotta change your life
I'm too... cool
Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's ride

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, told y'all I'm too cool for y'all
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm too cool
Oh yeah
The moon is beautiful, let's get it, let's get it, let's get it, let's ride
The sun is even more beautiful, that's me y'all, that's right, that's right
Oh yeah, let's get it, let's get it, let's get it, let's ride
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
