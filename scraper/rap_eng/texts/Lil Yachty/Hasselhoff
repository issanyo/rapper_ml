[Intro: Lil Yachty]
This shit hard
Lil Boat, ayy, woo!

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Ayy, girls goin' wild, they took they top off
Ayy, the coupe goin' wild, I took the top off (bitch!)
Ayy, dove in the pussy so deep, that bitch callin' me  Hasselhoff (skrrt)
I made a dream come true, we servin' swag, no Oxeno

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Brother used to serve grams
And price at downtown parkin' cost (bitch)
Fuck what it cost
Pay the cost just to floss, jump off
18 years old, got my own crib (Lil Boat)
18 years old, got my own whip (Lil Boat)
This shit not regular (nope)
Dropped out of school and made more than a regular (bitch)
Told her pop that pussy like it's Penicillin
Put red dots on his head like his name was Krillin'
Now surpassed every rapper that started chillin'
Now they lookin' at Boat like I am the villain

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Ayy, girls goin' wild, they took they top off
Ayy, the coupe goin' wild, just took the top off (bitch!)
Ayy, dove in that pussy so deep, that bitch callin' me  Hasselhoff (skrrt)
I made a dream come true, we servin' swag, no Oxeno

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Ayy, talk to me polite
Or I'll have my young niggas come take out your chatter box
Just fucked a bitch named Daisy
I hit from the back while I grip on her dreadlocks
You'll be surprise what we fit in these ziplocks
Yacht Master shawty that shit do not tick tock
I made a milli, no Weezy, that's big locks
Shoot at your shawty from 40 for 40
Old niggas hate me, they daughter adore me
Dick in her gut 'cause her daddy annoying
Lyrical ass, nigga got me snorin'
Tryna make all this sense, that shit boring (bitch!)
(Shut that shit off, bitch)

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Ayy, girls goin' wild, they took they top off
Ayy, the coupe goin' wild, I took the top off (bitch!)

[Interlude: Lil Yachty]
Niggas hated me before I came in the game
These niggas gon' hate me when I leave this motherfucker, ya dig?

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Ayy, girls goin' wild, they took they top off
Ayy, the coupe goin' wild, I took the top off (bitch!)
Ayy, dove in the pussy so deep, that bitch callin' me  Hasselhoff (skrrt)
I made a dream come true, we servin' swag, no Oxeno

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Ayy, bitch
Woo! Lil Boat
Ayy, gang!
