[Darnell Boat:]
Hey folks, Darnell Boat here
I just wanted to say a little something about Kay The Yacht
One of Yachty's good friends
Now I've known him since he was a young boy
That's a good boy
But you know sometimes that boy crazy
That boy can get out of line
I done seen a couple of kids try to disrespect that boy
That boy's a fighter
That boy will knock someone's head off
That's a good kid though, that's a good kid
That Kay The Yacht boy he been there for Yachty since before
Since before I don't know when
That's a good kid
That Kay The Yacht boy is a good kid
