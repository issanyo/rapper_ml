[Intro]
One time for Pablo
Ay, yah, ay, yah

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
All this cash on me, I'm a walking bank
All this cash on me, I'm a walking bank
All this cash on me, I'm a walking bank
Nigga fuck what you rep bitch it's sail or sink
30 diamonds on my neck like a fish tank
I ain't eat that bitch pussy cause that shit stink
I ain't got no accuracy but my shooter do
Put that smoke to your mouth like the hookah do
And my gang small, we fit inside a hoola hoop
After I fuck I pass her up like an alley-oop
Niggas tryna get an endorsement boy that's like 25 on a good day
Bitches thinkin they a barbie doll but in real life they like Child's Play
Just cashed out on a new Benz, got the 5 Series, that's a good look
Nigga tried to make a diss song but nobody heard it cause that shit suck
Got a Gucci T I only wore once
Finna turn around and call these bitches cunts
Got a new bitch she a real model and she slim and black like a rolled blunt
Got 100 niggas back home and they all waitin' on me, gon' do somethin'
I mean wait on me to go pull somethin'
I been said it like I knew somethin'
Lil Boat (bitch)

[Hook: Pablo Skywalkin]
If I don't like that nigga, I'm gone flex on him
These hoes they ain't shit, I don't stress on 'em
True Religion fit, I feel blessed on 'em
Ima shit on these niggas, make a mess on 'em
All my belts and my shoes got the F's on 'em
If I don't like that nigga, I'm gone flex on him
If I don't like that bitch, I'm gone flex on her
These Louie sneakers, bitch come play chess on em

[Verse 2: Pablo Skywalkin]
White girl tryna smoke me one
With a choosin bitch, and I'm the chosen one
Give y'all niggas the Gucci watch, on my left wrist is the frozen one
All these Louies in the shoe boxes, I don't know what color let me open one
Riding around in this Rolex, hoes tweeting me it's that over ton
That's no lie, circle tighter than a bow tie
I'm high as hell, love Gucci belts no YSL
With a model bitch, and she shy as hell
She don't speak, but she scream loud when you hittin deep
If you don't work, you don't eat
Niggas starving like Marvin, see more green nigga then it's sparking
Like barking, you a funny guy, Martin
If the blunt rolled, then I spark it
Yeah that shit rolled, then I spark it
My bitch mad cause I'm high again, her legs spread and I'm diving in
No peek-a-boo
Diamonds yellow like Pikachu, Louie frames what I'm peeking through

[Hook: Pablo Skywalkin]
If I don't like that nigga, I'm gone flex on him
These hoes they ain't shit, I don't stress on 'em
True Religion fit, I feel blessed on 'em
Ima shit on these niggas, make a mess on 'em
All my belts and my shoes got the F's on 'em
If I don't like that nigga, I'm gone flex on him
If I don't like that bitch, I'm gone flex on her
These Louie sneakers, bitch come play chess on em
