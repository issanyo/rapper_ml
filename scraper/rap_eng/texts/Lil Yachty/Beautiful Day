[Chorus: Burberry Perry]
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
A beautiful day  in the neighborhood
I just catch y'all in my fuckin' hood, okay
Yeah, it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
A beautiful day  in the neighborhood
I wish a fuck nigga would, okay

[Verse 1: Burberry Perry]
Yeah, it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
A beautiful day  in the neighborhood
I might go and give your bitch some wood
Yeah I gotta take a walk
Might get a hole in my cashmere socks
I'm in here doing shit, here or not
Let me in and she let me knock
Got about ten in my pocket
Fuck with me, .45 to your eye socket
Matter of fact might be a rocket
Put your ass in a nigga locket
Girl over and she wanna talk it
Bitch want me, yeah, she gotta bop
Niggas need to stop hatin'
Niggas talkin' cause they out of pocket
Hey, why are you calling me?
About three months ago, you were just stalling me
Stalling me, stalling me
Now you're out here stalking me
Bitch you can't get a talk from me, no, no
Riding around in my starter tee
I'm just counting my broccoli, yeah

[Chorus: Burberry Perry]
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
A beautiful day  in the neighborhood
I just catch y'all in my fuckin' hood, okay
Yeah, it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
A beautiful day  in the neighborhood
I wish a fuck nigga would, okay

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I just moved my momma out the neighborhood
I'm doing shit that niggas wish they could
I'm counting twenties, fifties, hundreds, all my bills
I just don't give a fuck what these niggas say
I'ma get money like any way
Cause I'm a boss and I'ma be real 'til I die
Well damn, I need that W penthouse
I put my dick all up in her mouth
I was the loose screw
Now I rock thousand dollar shoes
Fuck you if you ain't fuckin' with me
Yeah nigga I'm out counting my Gs
Yeah nigga, I get head out the boat
Twenty thousand dollars just for a show
Fuck up a check, I do that shit whenever
Change the weather, fuck it up, it's whatever
BMW with basketball leather
Skrrt, skrrt when I'm out of the place
Skrrt, skrrt, get her out of my face
I just moved my momma to a better place
Welcome to a nigga's neighborhood
I got no complaints, boy, I'm living good

[Chorus: Burberry Perry]
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
A beautiful day  in the neighborhood
I just catch y'all in my fuckin' hood, okay
Yeah, it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
A beautiful day  in the neighborhood
I wish a fuck nigga would, okay
