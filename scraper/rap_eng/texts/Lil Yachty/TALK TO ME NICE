[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
(Lil Boat) On God, I stay with the fire
Runnin' round town with the F on the tire
That boy a lil' weird, check his chest for the wire
These broke-ass rappers need words for hire
It's Yachty, bitch, can you tell me who's flyer? (flyer?)
Read 'bout me, bitch, in the Esquire
QC, the label, the empire, young rich nigga, I inspire
And I need that, never ask no one for feedback
Got a bitch to set niggas up, shawty love settin' rat traps
Shawty love eatin' Rap Snacks, at the crib with a F&N
Got a .223 and it don't kick back, make a million, then I sit back (gang)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Fuck with the move (movie), gang got the shoot (whoo)
15 thousand (yeah, yeah), just for some shoes (cash)

This is not a rental (no), I own this ho (dat way)
Yeah, prices
