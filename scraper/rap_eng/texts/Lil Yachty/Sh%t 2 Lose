[Bridge: Joey Fatts]
In the field with that tool man I ain't got shit to lose
Out here trapping like a fool man I ain't got shit to lose
I been grinding with my crew man I ain't got shit to lose
Ain't got time for no excuse man we got packs to move

[Verse 1: Joey Fatts]
Spend ninety bands on a coupe
Spend eight hunnid' on jewels
Try me my niggas gon' shoot
Because we ain't got shit to lose
You flexing, we taking these jewels
He running we taking his shoes
She choosing, I'm taking his boo
Not stressing, I'm flexing on you
A nigga in these streets straight head first
Because it's all I know
Paper chasing bread till my legs hurt
Man I gotta' get mo'
It's time for a come up
A nigga been grinding all summer
Serving that base like a drummer
Probably serve yay to your momma
On that one way, young nigga serving weight out a Honda
We been through it all
From [?] to run ins with the law
I'm tryna' ball with my dogs
We on the block, tryna' get that dough
For the ones that we lost
Yams and my nigga DJ
I'm missing you more everyday
Can't wait till I see y'all again

[Pre-Hook: Lil Yachty]
Me and mines been working too hard, to let y'all starve us, we can't lose
Cause we ain't got shit to lose
We on the move

[Hook: Joey Fatts]
Faded off this dope, I'm hella' high, wish I could fly away
Back against the ropes, I gotta' fight man, I'm gon' find a way
I've been on the low tryna' get right man, I'm gon' get this cake
If it's the only thing I do bitch, I'm gon' grind away
Faded off this dope, I'm hella' high, wish I could fly away
Faded off this dope, I'm hella' high, wish I could fly away
Faded off this dope, I'm hella' high, wish I could fly away
Fly away, Wish I could fly away

[Bridge: Joey Fatts]
In the field with that tool man I ain't got shit to lose
Out here trapping like a fool man I ain't got shit to lose
I been grinding with my crew man I ain't got shit to lose
Ain't got time for no excuse man we got packs to move

Screaming fuck the other side
And it's gon' be this way till I die
Too many of our mommas done cried
Too many of my niggas doing time
So if I catch him out of bounds he's getting fried
Taking trips out of town, getting high
Get caught with these pounds, I'm doing life
Gotta' do what we do to get by
Street nigga, same old story
Took by the same old fourty
Twenty forty years, same old shawty that you knew from the East
On 91st with Cory, starting to feel like this shit is meant for me
I been in the streets for a minute
My nigga [?] in a minute
My brother [?] for his sentence
Man I haven't seen his face in a minute
Gotta go through it to get to it
No matter the way man we gon' move it
No  matter what it takes man we gon' do it
Shit gotta' change man I'm gon' lose it
Time and time again
As days pass I'm losing my friends
Thinking "Damn when this shit gonna' end?"
On the lean bench, because life goes on and the world spins
Man a nigga getting caught up in this whirlwind

[Pre-Hook: Lil Yachty]
Me and mines been working too hard, to let y'all starve us, we can't lose
Cause we ain't got shit to lose
We on the move

[Hook: Joey Fatts]
Faded off this dope, I'm hella' high, wish I could fly away
Back against the ropes, I gotta' fight man, I'm gon' find a way
I've been on the low tryna' get right man, I'm gon' get this cake
If it's the only thing I do bitch, I'm gon' grind away
Faded off this dope, I'm hella' high, wish I could fly away
Faded off this dope, I'm hella' high, wish I could fly away
Faded off this dope, I'm hella' high, wish I could fly away
Fly away, fly away
