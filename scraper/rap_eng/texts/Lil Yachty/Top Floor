Chorus (Lil Yachty):
Where we going, we're going to the hoes
Where we going, we're going to the top floor
Yeah, we're going to where all them nights
Yeah, stackin' two up in the styrofoam

Where we going, we're going to the hoes
Where we going, we're going to the top floor
Yeah, we're going to where all them nights
Yeah, stackin' two up in the styrofoam

Verse 1 (Randy):
Crystal clear diamonds on my glasses
Only keep a bad bitch, only nice fabric
You ain't in my squad, you ain't in the squad-matics
Pull up in a wagon, smoke em then we ash em
"eeny meeny miny moe, how many thotties in this club wanna go?"
I just dropped my top, I just poured up drop
Your bitch on me like some damn sun block
Lil boat and Randy just pulled up in a yacht
Massacre these hoes like Texas chain saw
Ben & Jerry Lambo ice cream paint job
How you outside this damn club still hating?

Chorus (Lil Yachty):
Where we going, we're going to the hoes
Where we going, we're going to the top floor
Yeah, we're going to where all them nights
Yeah, stackin' two up in the styrofoam

Where we going, we're going to the hoes
Where we going, we're going to the top floor
Yeah, we're going to where all them nights
Yeah, stackin' two up in the styrofoam

Verse 2 (Larry LoudPack):
Red made me sleepy and I must've missed your call
The good Lord showed me, they some pussies after all
The midpack gonna give my ass a headache
Flexed up like I'm going on a first date
Man down, you thought that he need some first aid
I bust and then went ghost like Bill Murray
Louis bath robe right next to telescope
Riding dirty with the .30, I couldn't tell them folks

Chorus (Lil Yachty):
Where we going, we're going to the hoes
Where we going, we're going to the top floor
Yeah, we're going to where all them nights
Yeah, stackin' two up in the styrofoam

Where we going, we're going to the hoes
Where we going, we're going to the top floor
Yeah, we're going to where all them nights
Yeah, stackin' two up in the styrofoam
