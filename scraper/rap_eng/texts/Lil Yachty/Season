[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Might buy a river to go swim in
I was born rich like I'm Diggy Simmons
Teeth bright like a bowl of lemons
Need an old bitch that look like Robin Givens

[Bridge: Nessly]
It's my season, my season
They didn't miss me when I went and left my region
Now that they miss me, they want me to send a beacon

[Verse 1: Nessly]
Woke up like eight in the morning
Recorded this, like I'm on Sway in the Morning
I need the crib with the lake and a forest
My bae be foreign, I made her tourist, yuh
The only girl I want is Aya Jones
Forget Aya, I'ma fly her home
I'ma buy Aya an island home (yuh)
Put some diamonds on her collarbone
With my old hoes, I would hide my phone
Old hunnids and they all a tone
Bitch, my pocket, this is a college loan
It's money that you smell, it's not cologne
All year been on road, green go, won't slow
I shot my shot, boom, boom, reload

[Chorus: Nessly & Lil Yachty]
All year long, summer, spring, winter, fall (yeah)
All year long, summer, spring, winter, fall (yeah)
All year long, summer, spring, winter, fall (yah)
All year long, summer, spring, winter, fall (Lil Boat, yah, uh)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Might buy a river to go swim in
I was born rich like I'm Diggy Simmons
Teeth bright like a bowl of lemons
Need an old bitch that look like Robin Givens
Might take a trip to get away in the trap with the AK
Fuckin' on a bitch named Samantha
And her pussy wetter than a tidal wave
Phone been ringin' all damn day
Hunnid plays just to get made
Bustin' juggs in the hallway
Never went to class 'cause that shit was gay
I dropped out to make more money
Hipster hoes that look like snow bunnies
One to suck dick and one to fuck on me
Time's tickin', so I need it now

[Chorus: Nessly]
All year long, summer, spring, winter, fall (yeah)
All year long, summer, spring, winter, fall (yeah)
All year long, summer, spring, winter, fall (yah)
All year long, summer, spring, winter, fall (yah)

[Bridge: Nessly]
It's my season, my season
They didn't miss me when I went and left my region
Now that they miss me, they want me to send a beacon
It's my season, my season
