[Hook: Cyrax]
I can't waste time on a hoe
You cannot catch me you slow
I cannot ball wit no jokes
Baby I'm ballin', no coach
I spent a check on my clothes
She give me neck and I go
I cannot ball wit no jokes
Baby I'm ballin', no coach
I can't waste time on a hoe
You cannot catch me you slow
I cannot ball on no jokes
Baby I'm ballin', no coach
I spent a check on my clothes
She give me neck and I go
I cannot ball wit no jokes
Baby I'm ballin', no coach

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat,  wrist game sicker
I'm a real nigga
Bitch, don’t take no pictures
Say my name in vain
Take you out the game
It’s a car around my neck
I was born to flex, I was born to ball
Don't answer nothin' but money calls
One piece that nigga like overalls
Bitches fucked 'em both from wall to wall
Everything I do is for my gang
I remember wearin' fake chains
I remember bein' called a lame
Now a nigga ballin' out the paint
Flexin' so hard, bitch I ball like a starter
Never needin' no Coach Carter
Big SUV bitch I never rode Marta
Niggas hate Boat cause that nigga go farther , woah

Baby I'm ballin', no coach

[Verse 2: Yung Weej]
Glock 17 with a beam
Turn your block to a crime scene
Fucked the bitch when I was 13
Started trappin' when I was 14
When I turn 15 I'ma need a lot of things
D Savage he stay with the Mac
RIP my brother Jack
Please don't try to fuck with me
40 with extended clip
Bring your bitch cause she the flip
Can't trust no one but myself
All I smoke is sasha
Some OG's and some cookies bitch
Sake world still hittin' licks
Sake world still gettin' rich
