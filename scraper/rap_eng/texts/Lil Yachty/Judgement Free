[Intro]
Lil Boat

[Pre-Chorus]
This is just how I am
This is just how I was created
Don't you judge who I am
Cause I still think that I am the greatest

[Chorus]
Don't judge me by the color of my skin today
And don't crucify none of my friends today
And when I pull up in the Benz, don't think that I stole it
And don't think that, no, don't think that, no

[Bridge]
Let me be, judgement free
And don't think that, no, don't think that, no

[Chorus]
So don't judge me by the color of my skin today
And don't crucify none of my friends today
And when I pull up in the Benz, don't think that it's rented
And don't think that, no, don't think that, no
Don't judge me by the color of my skin today
Don't judgement me no, don't judge me no
And don't crucify none of my friends today
And let us be judgement free

[Verse]
Let us be judgement free, let us be judgement free
I'm not a pretender
I know you know what's going on
Yes I can feel your anger
I just wanna know what's going on
Cause I'm riding around with my friends, yeah, and we balling
We hit the block and we ball hard, no Spalding
And no energy around me can be negative, no never
I remain positive forever

[Bridge]
Let me be judgement free
And don't think that, no, don't think that, no

[Chorus]
Don't judge me by the color of my skin today
And don't crucify none of my friends today
And when I pull up in the Benz, don't think that it's rented
And don't think that, no, don't think that, no
Don't judge me by the color of my skin today
Don't judgement no, don't judge me no
And don't crucify any of my friends today
And just let us be judgement free

[Bridge]
Let us be judgement free, let us be judgement free
Just let us be judgement free

[Chorus]
Don't judge me by the color of my skin today
And don't crucify none of my friends today
And when I pull up in the Benz, don't think that it's rented
And don't think that, no, don't think that, no
Don't judge me by the color of my skin today
Don't judgement no, don't judge me no
And don't crucify any of my friends today
And just let us be judgement free

[Outro]
Let us be judgement free, let us be judgement free
