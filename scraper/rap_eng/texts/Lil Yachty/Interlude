[Verse 1: Lil Yachty & Offset]
(Yeah yeah)
Crib is dimensional, my bitch is seminal
Orange Dickey suit like it's Santa, I'm criminal
Hundreds be indigo, pistols identical
Aim at the imbeciles (wooh wooh wooh)
Yeah, fuck up a check now, my family set now
She gon' have sex now
Guap on his head in the split of a text now (uh)
Twin twin turbo, drop top Benz rollin'
Beat from the back, leave her pussy look swollen
Fuck plain gold, all my shit fully frozen
Keep talkin' crazy, you gon' get your shit stolen (hoo hoo, hoo)
I dropped a hundred on that all white Maybach, they said that it's ready
And the inside seats is red like spaghetti
Bought a new chain, it's platinum like machetes

[Verse 2: Offset]
(Offset)
I show my Patek so much, say I'm petty (petty)
Get in that pussy, I beat it and shred it (beat)
Roll up the backwood, the gas is unleaded (cookie)
Talkin' 'bout smoke but that chopper gon' dead it (smoke)
Subscribin' the script to your bitch, give her meddies
Pull up in that vert, watch me skrt like Andretti (skrt)
We eat the beef, stack up the lettuce (hey)
My mama keep having the Chanel fetish (mama)
Yeah, we ain't doin' nothin' for the clout (yeah)
Catch a nigga down bad, we gon' get your mouth (uh)
Water my wrist and my neck make me drown (splash)
I hit your bitch but I'm curving her now (curve)
Shawty the action, the verb not a noun (verb)
Slurp is so perfect, she burpin' me now (slurp)
Uh, it's a perc in me now (perc)
Surgery now, take the top off the Lam
