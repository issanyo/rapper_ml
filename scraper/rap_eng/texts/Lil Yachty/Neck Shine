[Prehook: Lil Yachty]
Damn my neck shine like a bitch (Woah, woah)
Damn my neck shine like a bitch
Damn my wrist shine like a bitch (Damn, damn)
Damn my wrist shine like a bitch, damn
Damn my neck shine like a bitch
Damn my neck shine like a bitch

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Damn my neck shine like a bitch
Bitch check the ice on my wrist
Check out my diamonds they polar, my wrist getting colder, my neck lookin frozen
I just made a twenty flexin in a Bentley, it was me and Quavo ridin down Ocean (damn)
Twenty-two diamonds they realer got red rubies in my necklaces look like Thriller
Got killers on killers, they shoot for Lil Boat, though
I don't do no drugs, but my bitch, she do coke though
Ridin' on ridin' in that motherfuckin Volvo
A nigga so up that he feelin' like Pablo
Posin and fuckin' up pics for the Fader
Young nigga, your Father, I feel like Darth Vader
My niggas be hittin them juugs and them capers
Can't bring them around cause them niggas on papers
Stunt! Fuck up the fuck up my bitch lookin' stuck up
I count up then count up then recount the count up for reassurance
I might crash the whip that got no insurance
Fuck that lil bitch with the long endurance
Chains on my neck look like water currents
Look up to me like Lil Boat is Mufasa
I dropped out of school and made more than your doctor, I'm proper

Damn, damn, damn my neck shine like a bitch

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Twenty-One, my wrist water bitch she goin swimmin'
Beat a nigga ass and snatch his pendant
Thirty on my wrist and I'm independent
Skrt-skrt came in scrapin the bowl
Young Savage really trappin the four
Twenty-two carats he wrapped up in gold
Chasin money, you wrapped up with your hoe (Pwsh pwsh)
Bitch I started that, put some holes in your starter cap
My wrist water, like Lil Boat, put big dick in a lil hoe
And I'm slaughter gang, and we hurt shit
Put a nigga in the hearse shit
Buying cars ain't no hurt shit
And my pistol hot like jerk chicken
