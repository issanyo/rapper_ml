[Intro]
Young Boat, I'm the king of the teens
Bitch go to sleep, she gon' see me in her dreams
That bitch go to sleep, she gon' see me in her... (MISOGI) woah

[Hook]
Young Boat, I'm the king of the teens
Bitch go to sleep, she gon' see me in her dreams
Every time I walk around, these three thousand dollar jeans
All these pussy niggas fiends, I'm the king of the teens
Damn, Lil Boat, you the king of the teens
Damn, Lil Boat, you the king of the teens
My bitch rollin' off a bean, she the one who tote my steam
Damn, Lil Boat, you the king of the teens

[Verse 1]
Damn, Lil Boat really made it overnight
26 bitches, ride me like a bike
My diamonds, they bite, my niggas, they fight
My niggas, they knock your ass out like they're Mike
Rae Sremmurd, Boat: I do not have a type
Fly as a kite, I got bitches on ice
She gon' come over, come over for dick
Suck on the stick then dip with your bitch

[Hook]
Young Boat, I'm the king of the teens
Bitch go to sleep, she gon' see me in her dreams
Every time I walk around, you see thousand dollar jeans
All these pussy niggas fiends, I'm the king of the teens
Damn Lil Boat, you the king of the teens
Damn Lil Boat, you the king of the teens
My bitch rollin' off a bean, she the one who tote my sting
Damn Lil Boat, you the king of the teens

[Verse 2]
How'd you do it? That's the question that they're askin'
Parents mad at my ass cause their kids sing my song in class
Well oh well, I'm at the front like doorbells
And shout out to my gang cause my gang stayed the same

[Hook]
Young Boat, I'm the king of the teens
Bitch go to sleep, she gon' see me in her dreams
Every time I walk around, you see thousand dollar jeans
All these pussy niggas fiends, I'm the king of the teens
Damn Lil Boat, you the king of the teens
Damn Lil Boat, you the king of the teens
My bitch rollin' off a bean, she the one who tote my sting
Damn Lil Boat, you the king of the teens
