[Verse 1: Goonew]
Homicide Boyz and we keep a chopper
Grab the draco, bouta hit his partner (grab the draco!)
Sippin' on lean, nigga, where the doctor?
Poppin' on percs and my heart stoppin'
Spinning a bin in a green Honda
Sippin' on drank with my drank partner
I need my money like green card
I'm crossing the plug with my damn partner
Ooo, I'm crossing the plug (plug)
Ran off with the plug
Auntie hoppin' on a boat (Hey, Auntie!)
Plugged in, Lil Boat
Thought it was drop but it's soap
No pen, no pad, nigga never wrote
(?)
Hoodrich, never cheap, never broke
Homicide, homicide, homicide, homicide

Homicide Boyz gotta keep a stick

Homicide Boyz on that demon shit
Shoot the Glock up with the left and the right wrist
Chopstick on me, we can have a war, ISIS
I'm the big homie, these niggas don't like it
Hands on, all my niggas, they excited
They snatching chains and they fightin'

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
I'm in this bitch with the pipe
Baby blue G-wagon look just like Skype
If I like the lil bitch imma send her a flight
I put diamonds in everything make sure the price right
Nigga, we really rich
She lickin the dick like it's cinnamon (slurp)
Bookbag filled with them benjamins (yeah)
I gotta have drink like the tin man
Baby girl poppin' the ecstacy (ecstacy)
All these new niggas they scared of me
I'm with Lil Dude and Goonew in the Regency (Trapnanana!)
Sippin on drank it's the recipe
I'm in the X6 and I skrt it
They believe what I say cuz how I word it
Shawty gonna give me pussy and I'ma hurt it
In an '18 Maybach and I wish it had curtains
