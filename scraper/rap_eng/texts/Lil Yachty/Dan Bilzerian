[Chorus: T-Pain]
They gon' talk about me, they gon' talk about me
They can't walk around me, they can't walk around me
Bitch I'm rich as fuck, bitch I'm rich as fuck
Them hoes can sick a duck, you can sick a duck
I get 10 Brazilians like I'm Dan Bilzerian
I get 10 Brazilians like I'm Dan Bilzerian
Bitch I'm rich as fuck, bitch I'm rich as fuck
Them hoes can sick a duck, bitches sick a duck

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I can pull up on you with a million bucks
Bitch I'm with the squad, we got a million trucks
Just 'cause you don't see me don't mean I ain't movin'
I be in the dark with the semi tucked
You don't want this shit to go to fisticuffs
Boy pass me that bottle, I ain't get enough
If they gon' talk about me I'ma let 'em talk
Bitch I'm takin' off, bitch I'm takin' off
Get off me, ho

[Chorus: T-Pain]
They gon' talk about me, they gon' talk about me
They can't walk around me, they can't walk around me
Bitch I'm rich as fuck, bitch I'm rich as fuck
Them hoes can sick a duck, you can sick a duck
I get 10 Brazilians like I'm Dan Bilzerian
I get 10 Brazilians like I'm Dan Bilzerian
Bitch I'm rich as fuck, bitch I'm rich as fuck
Them hoes can sick a duck, bitches sick a duck

[Refrain: T-Pain]
I'ma get some sauce, I'ma get some sauce
I'ma get some sauce, I'ma get some sauce
Once they pour it on me you can't get it off
I'ma get some sauce, I'ma get some sauce
Get off me, ho

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Who that?
Throw that ho like two stacks
Hit it in the booty 'til them booty cheeks turn blue black
Order at the crib, bring the crew back
Let me see you do that, do that, huh, huh, woo!
Shout out to my niggas on that Houston shit
It ain't nothin' better than a Houston bitch
If she ain't let me fuck, I say, "Fuck that bitch"
But if she wanna fuck I'ma fuck that bitch
You see me bro?

[Chorus: T-Pain]
They gon' talk about me, they gon' talk about me
They can't walk around me, they can't walk around me
Bitch I'm rich as fuck, bitch I'm rich as fuck
Them hoes can sick a duck, you can sick a duck
I get 10 Brazilians like I'm Dan Bilzerian
I get 10 Brazilians like I'm Dan Bilzerian
Bitch I'm rich as fuck, bitch I'm rich as fuck
Them hoes can sick a duck, bitches sick a duck

[Refrain: T-Pain & Lil Yachty]
I'ma get some sauce, I'ma get some sauce
I'ma get some sauce, I'ma get some sauce
Once they pour it on me you can't get it off
Ayy, Lil Boat
I'ma get some sauce, I'ma get some sauce
Ayy, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat
Get off me, ho

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
All my niggas ridin' dirty on that old Chamillion' (skrrt skrrt)
I'ma be the first teenager to reach a trillion
Ooh bitch I'm rich as fuck, I don't need your love
I got powers in my beads like Mike with his glove
You can't run up on me, I keep MAC around me (no you can't)
Macky, Max and Ronald spray it, get to soundin' (yes it do)
Please don't try your luck, please do not get buck (please do not)
Tell the blogs to listen close, I don't give a fuck
Lil Boat!

[Chorus: T-Pain + Lil Yachty]
They gon' talk about me, they gon' talk about me (yeah)
They can't walk around me, they can't walk around me (no they can't)
Bitch I'm rich as fuck, bitch I'm rich as fuck (bitch I'm rich as fuck)
Them hoes can sick a duck, you can sick a duck (they can suck a dick)
I get 10 Brazilians like I'm Dan Bilzerian (gang, gang)
I get 10 Brazilians like I'm Dan Bilzerian (bitch it's T-Pain)
Bitch I'm rich as fuck, bitch I'm rich as fuck (T-Pain and Lil Boat)
Them hoes can sick a duck, bitches sick a duck
