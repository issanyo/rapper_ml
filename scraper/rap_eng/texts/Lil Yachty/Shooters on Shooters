Shooters on shooters, shooters on shooters
Shooters on shooters, shooters on shooters
Shooters on shooters on shooters

[Verse 1: Jban$2Turnt]
Shooters on shooters, Uzi Uzi with the Ruger
I'm not no hooper, my side man, he a shooter
Bitch, he keep a Cobra, he move in, knock your top off
Mad gun with the drop off
Hop in the Lamb, no chop it off
Kick your head like a Soccerball, talkin shit, well you're not now
It like clockwork when we clock in
When you clock out, your rock slow
Chop a nigga from his ankels, playing toe tag with a missal toe
Christmas day, you goin miss that day, ain't no presents in that grave, hoe
J Bands!

Shooters on shooters, shooters on shooters

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Usually don't do this, but I got the facts to proove this
Kickin in doors, 18 years old, number 1 song on the chart list
They used to say no for the dark pits, now I say bitch, go park this
And I check the tag when I perchis, just bought a brand new fortrace
I keep both tacktals with me, fuck with Lil Boat, that's ratical
Made that money, jeweller got me shining, covered in the gold and the diamonds
Whent from a 0 to a teenage hero, got that glocc in my sock, I been walking with Nero
I hit the bank and deposit them riches
Just fucked a stripper and 2 other bitches
Lil Boat!
