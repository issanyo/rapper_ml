[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Hey, Hey, Aye
Skrt, Yuh, Yeah, yeah
Yeeeaaaaaaaahhh, Yeaaaahh

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Never been the type to sit 'round and watch from the bleachers
I grew up and learned that I ain't learned shit from a teacher
Talk the slickest, could've dropped out and became a preacher
You niggas broke so stop asking how much cost for a feature
One more bitch is off the molly, they a bag of geekers
Shout out Champs 'cause they be blessin' me early with sneakers
Boat and Byou ensemble blastin' through your speakers
Cut the check or you're cut off, it's simple as Tetris

[Verse 2: Byou]
Pull up in a lexus, pew, Shooting out the door though
Nowadays turn a peace sign Mercedes Logo
Woah, hoah, aye, take my photo
Yuh, yuh, take my photo
Got fake raps still use hoes, slam her on the table like dominoes
Everything comin' out the radio sound just like that nigga radio
And everything you said, swear my niggas done said before
If you talkin' 'bout this rap game you're all for but you're awful
Just dropped outta college
But got hella bullets like a slideshow
I put gold on everything, I even put it on a bible
Do not do what I do, I do not do what my idol do
My raps aren't recitable, term for term unreliable

[Hook: Lil Yachty x2]
I'm gone, but call me on my Iphone, phone chirpin' all damn night long
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm gone, woah, woah damn, woah
I'm gone, yeah, but call me on my iphone, phone chirpin' all damn night long
Yeah, Yeah, but I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm gone, but call me on my Iphone, phone chirpin' all damn night long
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm gone, woah, woah damn, woah
I'm gone, yeah
