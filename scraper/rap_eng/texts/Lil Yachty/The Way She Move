[Chorus: FIJI]
The way she move, got me in a trance
Pockets full of bands, diamonds do the dance
Smoking purple stuff, low key in the cut
It's funny when you up, they gon' show you love
The way she move, got me in a trance
Pockets full of bands, diamonds do the dance
Smoking purple stuff, low key in the cut
It's funny when you up, they gon' show you love

[Verse 1: FIJI]
She wanna know how I stuffed eight bands in my pants
Diamonds dance, Goyard straight from France
Caught me in a trance the way you dance
When you wanna blow all my bands
It ain't trickin' if you got it
Gucci linen in your closet
Your girl ask me how you got it
Baby tell her FIJI bought it
I wanna give your mom a grandson, he'll be handsome
Diamonds dancing, they cost me thousands
They cost me thousands

[Chorus: FIJI]
The way she move, got me in a trance
Pockets full of bands, diamonds do the dance
Smoking purple stuff, low key in the cut
It's funny when you up, they gon' show you love
The way she move, got me in a trance
Pockets full of bands, diamonds do the dance
Smoking purple stuff, low key in the cut
It's funny when you up, they gon' show you love

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
(Lil Boat)
The way she moves, gots me in a trance
I might buy her shoes, but I can't pay her rent
Oh no no no I can't do, that's for your mans
And if I ever slip up (what)
It's time for B plan (switch it up)
My diamonds dance though
Quick, too smooth, I take a nigga main ho
Big Benz, Beamer, and six on the Range Rover
You pick, you chose how you tryna roll
And FIJI that's my nigga (gang)
CMDWN tell them what's gang (gang gang)
In the club throwing the tens
'Cause she live with me and friends
She tryna roll with the gang (gang gang gang)
Lil Boat

[Chorus: FIJI]
The way she move, got me in a trance
Pockets full of bands, diamonds do the dance
Smoking purple stuff, low key in the cut
It's funny when you up, they gon' show you love
The way she move, got me in a trance
Pockets full of bands, diamonds do the dance
Smoking purple stuff, low key in the cut
It's funny when you up, they gon' show you love
