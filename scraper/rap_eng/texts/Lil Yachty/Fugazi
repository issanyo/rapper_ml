[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat!
Ayy, ayy, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I do not fuck with these niggas, ayy
I do not fuck with these niggas
Clip to his lip if he fuck with my figures
I feel like Trey Songz 'cause I keep me a trigga
Nigga mad 'cause his bitch want a picture
Don't be mad, nigga, get up your weight
Goyard on a young nigga's waist
$20,000, put it straight in your face
I do not fuck with these niggas, ayy
I do not fuck with these niggas
Clip to his lip if he fuck with my figures
I feel like Trey Songz 'cause I keep me a trigga
Nigga mad 'cause his bitch want a picture
Don't be mad, nigga, get up your weight
Goyard on a young nigga's waist
$20,000, put it straight in your face

[Verse: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Tell the truth, who me? Wear, the truth hurts
And my scars is the mothafuckin' proof
Urk, skrrt, sound of the Craftmatic seat
When I lean in the Panorama coupe
Uh, burp, niggas feel a little bit gassy
Stomach on knock knock, sippin' on wop wop
Rollie on a nigga don't tick tock
I smell fugazi comin' from your wristwatch
Niggas mad, bitch I'm glad like a bag ($30,000)
Don't forget I'm on your ass like some grass
Make his face kiss my knuckles like some brass
Vroom, vroom, what I'm smokin' nitrous gas, lil' bitch

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I do not fuck with these niggas, ayy
I do not fuck with these niggas
Clip to his lip if he fuck with my figures
I feel like Trey Songz 'cause I keep me a trigga
Nigga mad 'cause his bitch want a picture
Don't be mad, nigga, get up your weight
Goyard on a young nigga's waist
$20,000, put it straight in your face
I do not fuck with these niggas, ayy
I do not fuck with these niggas
Clip to his lip if he fuck with my figures
I feel like Trey Songz 'cause I keep me a trigga
Nigga mad 'cause his bitch want a picture
Don't be mad, nigga, get up your weight
Goyard on a young nigga's waist
$20,000, put it straight in your face

[Bridge: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat!
Straight in your face
Lil Boat!
Straight in your face

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I do not fuck with these niggas, ayy
I do not fuck with these niggas
Clip to his lip if he fuck with my figures
I feel like Trey Songz 'cause I keep me a trigga
Nigga mad 'cause his bitch want a picture
Don't be mad, nigga, get up your weight
Goyard on a young nigga's waist
$20,000, put it straight in your face
I do not fuck with these niggas, ayy
I do not fuck with these niggas
Clip to his lip if he fuck with my figures
I feel like Trey Songz 'cause I keep me a trigga
Nigga mad 'cause his bitch want a picture
Don't be mad, nigga, get up your weight
Goyard on a young nigga's waist
$20,000, put it straight in your face

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat!
Straight in your face
