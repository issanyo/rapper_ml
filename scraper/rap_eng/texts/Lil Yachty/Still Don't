[Intro: Lil Yachty & Jamie Foxx]
Takeoff
Yo Pi'erre you wanna come out here?

[Verse]
Bust a nigga brain if he try to take a chain (gang)
22 chains and they all say my name
Gang gang gang give a fuck about a bitch (fuck her)
75 karats in my new necklace (nah for real)
We don't give a damn about a bitch (aye)
We don't give a damn about a bitch (aye)
Middle fingers up fuck a nigga and his clique (fuck 'em)
I bet that pussy nigga won't come around me with his bitch (niggas scared)
I take a nigga bitch (gang gang)
Watch on my wrist out of date but it glist
Jimmy Pang on my gang is off the chain for real
High school I spent most my days off the pill
Real talk I probably could't tell you how it feel
But I know how it feels to be rich cause I am (for real)

[Hook]
Still don't give a damn about a bitch (fuck 'em)
Still don't give a fuck about a bitch (fuck 'em, aye, gang gang)
Still don't give a damn about a bitch
Put your middle finger up fuck a nigga and his clique (gang gang gang gang)
Still wont give a dollar to a hoe
Fuck these pussy niggas they ain't bro (facts)
Fuck these pussy niggas they ain't gang
Niggas walking around with they fake diamond chains
