[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Killa killa

Iced out rings twerkin' like Shakira

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Lil boat, dirt boy, killa killa
Iced out rings twerkin' like Shakira
Million on a Monday, I'm a dream chaser
I feel like Meek Mill before he signed a deal
30k killa killa, ice ring
Lil boat, dirt boy, killa killa
Iced out rings twerkin' like Shakira
Lil boat, dirt boy, killa killa

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Chick chick, boom, on that same shit
I need India love on my game shit
Gang of hot boys, on my wayne shit
Bang with my gang on that same shit
Knock a nigga wrong if he talkin' shit
I don't think that nigga wanna talk shit
Iced out lil' boy, killa killa
Lil boat bust a nigga, no fear
Diamonds on my neck like a chandelier
Shotties in the party aim 'em at ya dub
Niggas know lil' boat never gave a fuck
30s if these niggas tryna get bucked

[Interlude: Black Kray]
Look pig gang, you see me, you see pink Benzes you heard me
Diamonds on my frame mane, money ain't shit, you heard me
Nigga, Citgo, wah

[Verse 2: Black Kray]
Range Rover, lil' killa
Big fur, lil' chinchilla
Big ice, shit, big sticks
Shit, big lights, I said lil' nigga quit
Right there with my shooter when the block hot
Cuh cookin' hard, no crock pot
Shit, pink Range Rover, it got drop top
Shit, spend a little money, make the bitch drop
I hit clubs nigga with my right hand
Shit, Barbie Benz jeep when a nigga land
They gon' TI, pop a rubberband
Hit the strip club, do the money dance
In and out the crib, fuckin' up the club
You know I let 'em all fuckin' up my dough
Phantom, Peach fur shoppin' wit my hoe
Lil rari do that dash, I don't drive slow
