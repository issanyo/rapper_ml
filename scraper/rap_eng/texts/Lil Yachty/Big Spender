[Hook/Main Verse: Lil Yachty]
Shoot for my brother
I stunt like none other
I fuck her in the covers I touch her like Busta
Got so many diamonds and my watch is cluster
No fucks on you niggas, sip [t***?] and I know it
Fender bender
Trap like a gold blender, (Lil Boat)
Eat the pussy like a cold tender, I ain't seeing no contenders, (yeah)
Broke nigga I'm a big spender
Still might up on spinners

Watch you fuck on his bitch like I did
I ain't got no kids
But all of these niggas my sons
Bro shoot like Nash when he played for the Suns
Ball like number 9 ain't talking no gun
Chew on that pussy like gum
Drinking lean like it's rum, huh (Lil Boat)!

Eat the pussy like a cold tender, I ain't seeing no contenders, (yeah)
Broke nigga I'm a big spender
Still might pull around and spin her

Watch you fuck on his bitch like I did
I ain't got no kids
But all of these niggas my sons
Bro shoot like Nash when he played for the Suns
Ball like number 9 ain't talking no gun
Chew on that pussy like gum
