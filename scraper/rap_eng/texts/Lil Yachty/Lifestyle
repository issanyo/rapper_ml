[Hook: DigitalNas]
In my foreign
My lifestyle is never boring
In Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood
Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood

[Verse 1: DigitalNas]
I count all this damn guap, now I’m splurging
I feel like I’m surfing
The way I’m catching all these waves
Getting revenge all summer 16
Get out my lane, we not the same
This ain’t a game, this my life
You a fraud, I’m not a pawn
I’m a star, you a light

[Hook: DigitalNas]
In my foreign
My lifestyle is never boring
In Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood
Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I count all this guap, that shit the same
Baby put some respek on my name
Same nigga, ain’t shit changed
Except I copped a couple diamond chains
In Hollywood, Hollywood
He said he could fuck my bitch and he probably could
Cause these hoes for everybody
Watch me skrt off in my Maserati
Kamikaze, [?] Gotti
Bitch nigga you’re nobody
Every hood Lil Boat good
Chill in Hollywood like a player should

[Hook: DigitalNas]
In my foreign
My lifestyle is never boring
In Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood
Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood
