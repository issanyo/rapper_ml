I might pull up to the vip in a Lexus
I might fuck a new bitch out in Texas
Whoa, Lil Yachty on a boat yeah
She know I get it for the low
That's why they all call my phone
When I get on, you gon' reach for your phone, yeah
And I just got some new diamonds in my teeth
I'm about to go fuck up the VIP
