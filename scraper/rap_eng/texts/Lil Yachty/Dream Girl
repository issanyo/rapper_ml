[Verse]
Put her on a plane, fly her out to spain
Berry, girl you my main she with me when I hit stains
Together we make it rain
In the winter we hop on a jet get MIA
And in my A where we stay
In our palace where she'll lay
And I work hard and then we play
Make soo much money we'll be straight for days
Straight for days
I'm her baller, she's my model
We be together forever till we both turn fossil
She's my dream girl, she's my dream girl
She's my dream girl
Where are you now and where to be found
I heard you got a man, but that nigga a clown
He not fly, can't show you 'round
Take you to the town
He can't make you happy
Maybe it's me, hell nah it ain't me
I'm too fleek, not tryna sound cocky
But baby come be with me
You're my goddess in all my dreams
So when I go to sleep I don't wanna wake up
That's why I pour soo much purple in my cup
Your my baby and I need your love

[Hook]
You're my dream girl, you're my dream girl
You're my dream girl, you're my dream girl
Together till-
You're my dream girl, you're my dream
You're my dream, you're my dream girl
You're my dream girl

[Bridge]
Put her on a plane, fly her out to spain
Berry, girl you my main she with me when I hit stains
Together we make it rain
In the winter we hop on a jet get MIA
And in my A, and in my A
And in my A
Baby girl you're my dream girl
And in my A
But, you're my dream girl
You're my dream girl
And in my A
Put her on a play, fly her out to spain
You're my dream girl
I'm her baller, she's my model
You're my dream girl and in my A
Where are you now?

[Verse]
Put her on a plane, fly her out to spain
Berry, girl you my main she with me when I hit stains
Together we make it rain
In the winter we hop on a jet to get MIA
And in my A where we stay
In our palace where she'll lay
And I work hard and then we play
Make soo much money we'll be straight for days
Straight for days
I'm her baller, she's my model
We be together forever till we both turn fossil
She's my dream girl, she's my dream girl
She's my dream girl
