[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat
Yeah, Lil Boat!

[Verse 1: Jovanie]
I got a lot of girls all in my contacts
But you the only girl I ever contact
When they hit my line
Like ring ring, I'ma hit decline

[Refrain: Jovanie]
Got a lady, I tell 'em every time
She amazing, my my
Upgrade like graduation
She hold me down like gravitation
They can't break my commitment up with ya, oh

[Pre-Hook: Jovanie]
Stuck to my side like Siamese
Girl you know I need you right beside me
Hold you real close to my body

[Hook: Jovanie]
I only got room for you, like a two seater
I'm only gon' ride with you, like a two seater
Ooh baby, you know this ain't no test drive
Fly you out from the east to the west side
I only got room for you, like a two seater

[Verse 2: Jovanie]
I got a lot of girls on my timeline
But you're the only one that's on my mind
They try to throw me signs
But I ain't caring 'cause I got a dime

[Refrain: Jovanie]
She my lady, I tell 'em every time
She amazing, my my
Upgrade like graduation
She hold me down like gravitation
They can't break my commitment up with ya, oh

[Pre-Hook: Jovaine]
Stuck to my side like Siamese
Girl you know I need you right beside me
Want you real close to my body

[Hook: Jovanie]
I only got room for you, like a two seater
I'm only gon' ride with you, like a two seater
Ooh baby, you know this ain't no test drive
Fly you out from the east to the west side
I only got room for you, like a two seater

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Don't bring none of your friends tonight, it's only me and you
In that SLS Mercedes coupe, we drift aloof
Never out the loop, she blow me like a can of soup
I'm never losing, you rich but you PT-Cruising, okay
I'm really having that way
You really spoiled 'cause every time you have it your way
You happy now 'cause your ex-nigga was cirque du soleil
Don't play, I'm not for all the gunplay
But brother 'dem'll knock you out your feng shui
I keep racks in my pocket though
And it's only room for two like a socket though
And sometimes maybe three when you're feeling nasty
I drop a 20 in the mall when I'm feeling cashy
I'm gon' go
All these other niggas need to know that
You'll always be loved like a throwback
And baby girl I hope you know that
I hope you know that

[Hook: Jovanie]
I only got room for you, like a two seater
I'm only gon' ride with you, like a two seater
Ooh baby, you know this ain't no test drive
Fly you out from the east to the west side
I only got room for you, like a two seater
