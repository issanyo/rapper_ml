[Verse 2: YGAzael]
Summertime with yo ho
Icing it lookin like glitter
Dont want your ho or your sister
Gucci tux on me its fitted
I go 200 speed limit
I put a ring on my toe
I just be rapping not singing
Daughter you niggas like lennon
Fuck you if you is offended
Pushing this car to its limits
You can get smoked like wood
Don’t speak on money I don’t understand
Niggas is wishing but making no plans
Summertime with yo ho
Icing it lookin' like glitter
I fucked your bitch whats for dinner
Don't want your ho or your sister
Riding top in my ghost
Don’t want the race you get smoked
Rolling big woods on a boast
Caribbean shorty said she from coast
Call her ohmegaladon
She give me head till the dawn
Might as well call me big sean
Cut thru you niggas like butter
Shoot at you niggas no stutter
I got the (?)
