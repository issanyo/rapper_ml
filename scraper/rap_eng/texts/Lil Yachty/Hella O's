[Intro:]
Lean, still get it from the Gusto
Young hot head man, cut throat
All these nat nats on don't go
Kick back and serve up them O's
Uh
Skr, skr, skrt, skrt
Uh, skrt, uh, skrt
Uh, uh
Skrt, skrt

[Verse 1:]
Pull up on your block and we squirting nines
Niggas wanna duke it, this the right time
Counting up, counting up hella bands
Using my guap as a face fan
K$upreme, that's my right hand
Niggas mobbing deep like a Taliban
Right now I'm a Harlem boy but Lil Yachty from Atlantastan
Stack the cheddar cheese on my night stand
If my money low then watch your life man
Lean, still get it from the Gusto
Young hot head man cutthroat
All these nat-nats on dumb go
Kick back and serve out them O's
Niggas strapped up like Girbauds
I just hopped out on them 4's
Bloody bandana my bros
But cuzzy bandana my woes
Bought bank and I bang on fo's
All these fuck niggas is hoes
He better not knock on my door
I bust a cap in his throat
I put a dick in his hoe
I might just flip out them O's
I just dropped weed on my toes
Brought my niggas 'round your hoe
Let 'em run train on ya wife
We pass that pussy all night
Then we stack it tall as kites
Nigga try me that's his life

[Hook:]
Hella O's, I been counting hella O's
Money stacking tall like Lego's
I been counting hella O's, hella O's
Hella O's, I been counting hella O's
Money stacking tall like Lego's
Told my plug I need a whole fix, serving off O's
I could flip a brick
Hella O's, hella O's
I been moving hella O's
Young RD counting hella O's

[Verse 2:]
Big full Chevy boy check out the candy paint canary
Yellow diamonds in my pinky ring
(Plug)
20 band juug's I could ball
I could ball, I could ball
Like 30 chains
All these bitches love me like I'm Jesus
Old money same age as Regis
But that shit long like R.Kelly
Fuck around and put shots in your belly
Told that hoe to meet me at the telly
I can never ever fold
RD be counting big O's
I been counting bank rolls
Money make her touch her toes
Money got me the hoes
Money got a nigga right
I be sipping dirty sprite

[Hook:]
Hella O's, I been counting hella O's
Money stacking tall like Lego's
I been counting hella O's, hella O's
Hella O's, I been counting hella O's
Money stacking tall like Lego's
Told my plug I need a whole fix, serving off O's
I could flip a brick
Hella O's, hella O's
I been moving hella O's
Young RD counting hella O's
