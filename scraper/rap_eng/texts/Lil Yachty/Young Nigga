[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Soulja Boy, Lil Yachty, Lil Boat, SOD, you already know
Whole bunch of money, whole bunch of cash since a young nigga
Man, we some young niggas
Been flexin' since a young nigga
Been doin' shit since a young nigga
Been doin' shit since a young nigga

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga
Been cappin' hoes since a young nigga
Been fuckin' hoes since a young nigga
Been a rich nigga since a young nigga
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga
Been fuckin' hoes since a young nigga
Been countin' guap since a young nigga
Been stuntin' hoes since a young nigga
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga

[Bridge: Lil Yachty]
I fucked that bitch as a young nigga
I count that guap as a young nigga
I skrt that whip as a young nigga
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Youngest nigga flexin', who is you testin'?
This ain't no actin', nigga, this ain't no wrestlin'
Hollow tips to cripple your chest in a second
Live in the S's, can't fuck with no peasants
I need me a Rover, can't stop 'til it's over
Your bitch bent over givin' me pussy
Ain't talkin' weed when I say she give me cookie
Jersey lil bitch, she look just like Snooki
Now I'm powered up, one hundred percent
Shoutout to my gang I represent
All these pussy niggas got Lil Boat bent
Don't you come at me if you can't pay your rent
Bitch nigga
Hungry nigga lookin' like a stick figure
Can't compare to me, your bank ain't bigger
Fuck up the fuck up cause I can
I can't fuck with the middleman

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
I can't fuck with the middleman
Pussy nigga where your boss
Hop in the Rari, get lost
Nigga be drippin' in sauce
The young nigga ran up the mulah
I just called up my jeweler
I pull up to the trap with them shooters
My young niggas shoot out the Uber
Aye, aye, hunnid K in one day
Yeah, that's Lil Yachty
Pull up to the trap in a brand new Bugatti
We ain't playin' with these niggas
We want B's, we want B's
Diamond chain on my neck
It's on freeze, it's on freeze
I just fucked your bitch
I just hit a lick
Young nigga pull up with them sticks and them hollow tips
Giuseppe karate kick
Nigga you know what I do
Pull up to the trap in a coupe
Me and Lil Yachty, we drop off the roof

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga
Been cappin' hoes since a young nigga
Been fuckin' hoes since a young nigga
Been a rich nigga since a young nigga
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga
Been fuckin' hoes since a young nigga
Been countin' guap since a young nigga
Been stuntin' hoes since a young nigga
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga

[Bridge: Lil Yachty]
I fucked that bitch as a young nigga
I count that guap as a young nigga
I skrt that whip as a young nigga
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga
