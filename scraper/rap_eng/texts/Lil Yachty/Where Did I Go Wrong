Where did I go wrong?
I don't even know
I'm so confused
Like what did I do to lose you?
Where did I go wrong?
I don't even know
I'm soo confused
Like what did I do to lose you?
Where did I go wrong?
I don't even know
I'm soo confused
Like what did I do to lose you?

[Verse]
I don't trust a bitch no, all these bitches foul
Triple M on my sneakers got them lookin' wild
New wrist cost a hunnid thou, that's how I'm doin' shit
Middle fingers up to my old bitch
Fuck my old bitch, I fucked my old bitch
I see your new bitch, yeah that's my old bitch
But I ain't trippin' though, I ball like Pippen though
I put a hunnid at your new nigga ain't touchin' me
They ain't touchin' me, they ain't touchin' Lil Boat
Flex 36 while I cross the boat
Yeah niggas watchin' Yachty with the long scope
But I ain't trippin' though, these niggas bitches though
