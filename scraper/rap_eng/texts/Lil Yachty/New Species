[Verse 1 : Young D]
Aye Young D, Young D
Told that bitch don't make me dip (aye)
Next time I pull up in a Viper whip
Still trappin' out the metro
Sold ten phones
Ten trap phones just to make a flip
Told ya this
Aw yeah boy
Hoes used to not fuck with the boy
Now they watchin' us cause they know I'm next
Thirty on my watch and thirty on my wrist
(?) head to toe
Thought I told you this
Cartier be all on my lens
You ain't gang if you ain't help me cop that Benz
Straight up out the slums where you don't make it from
I do this shit on my own

[Chorus : Lil Yachty]
Me and my niggas a different species
You can't tell us nothing we the feces (Aye we the shit)
Standing eight feet tall like a tiki (We big body)

[Verse 2 : Lil Yachty]
Them niggas bang red to (?) (Them niggas bloods)
They don't give a fuck
They'll bust it on Sesame Street (Them niggas shooters)
We the type to have sweet dreams on Elm Street (Don't give a fuck)
You the type to fake (?) I stay creep (You niggas pussy)
To all you niggas I'm the devil (I know you scared)
Niggas don't come close to my level (You niggas low bodied)
These niggas ain't my niggas they wonder boys (These niggas pussy niggas)
Give me five more months and we'll be bezel boys (I keep that Rolex watch)
I'm putting on for my city (That's my hometown)
Six Flags drive, you salute me when you see me (I know you fuck with boat)
Bitches suck dick cause I'm pretty (I know you sucked me up)
I got way too much money

[Chorus : Lil Yachty]
Me and my niggas a different species
You can't tell us nothing we the feces (Nah we the shit)
Standing eight feet tall like a tiki

[Verse 3 : Burberry Perry]
I remember being back at home
I remember niggas shit on me now niggas can't leave me 'lone
Can't shit on me no more nigga yeah leave my Porsche alone
Yo' bitch she blew me like a saxophone
Where she goin'
I heard she was hoin'
I'm out on yo' block
I check her house and she was hoin'
Yeah she was rowin'
Yeah I was scorin'
(?)
If you hear this girl I'm sorry that I snitched
And I'm sorry Nick but I had to fuck yo' bitch
You a bitch nigga, fuck you and yo' clique
See y'all niggas when I pull off inna foreign whip

[Verse 4 : BIGBRUTHACHUBBA]
I just hit yo' bitch from the back
Then I run off with the sack
You just might get hit with the mac
If you want the pack come to the trap
I just put the six on the map
I can't even lie I can't cap
I don't fuck with you don't want no dap
Then I fucked a little bitch then take a nap
