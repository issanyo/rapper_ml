From Snippet

[Intro]
Earl The Pearl, my boy Earl pourin' the beats
Yo that's my muthafuckin' nigga
Man this shit blowin'
That's my muthafuckin' brother

[Chorus]
We go way back like 8 tracks (uh! yup)
Diamonds in my mouth
Water wet with a Ajax
Nigga got like 8 plaques (ooh)
Rule number 1, never fuck with your safe [?] (yup)
Everything I say is facts
Whole gang come with [?]
....

[Verse]
.....
Don't talk about your problems I don't give a fuck (yuh)
Walk around, see me with that semi tucked (pew-pew)
I got lots of wok (wok!)
I got lots of red (red!)
I got lots of hoes (hoes!)
Giving lots of head
