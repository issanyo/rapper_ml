[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Lil nigga quit bitchin', I ball like a Piston
Them diamonds go fishing, they might hurt your vision
22 shots at his neck if he try me
Looking for me, pussy nigga you found me
I keep real money makers around me
All my niggas gotta stack up the cheddar
All my niggas got to get to the fetty
Pull off in a foreign like it's Andretti
Turn that pussy nigga’s brain to spaghetti
This a Rover nigga, this not a Chevy
Keep a couple white bitches with me
Had to nickname her Lil Debby
Cause she whip the fuckin’ pot, ay
Bitch don’t you run in my spot, woah
Bro had to remix the drop, woah
I beat my case, fuck the cops

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Plug meeting on the yacht
I was running from the cops
Whip a Rari with the egg beater
Trap jumping off the beeper
Bring that scale, fuck the 12
Drop a bird on the stove
Had to get it, god knows
Rich nigga, I was broke
Now I’m ballin’ like a champ
Break a brick with a stamp
Them diamonds they shining lil nigga
The chopper it hit you, my shooters official
Bought a chopper with a scope
They was hating, I’m the GOAT
Bad bitch roll the dope
Drop a baby in her throat

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Woah, damn, I just might run for president
I ain’t doing shows if it ain’t dividends
Got a white bitch with a big booty
Boy I swear to god she so heaven sent
Damn, eighty that's just how I’m rockin' yeah
Nigga run up, that’s his arm, that’s his leg, that’s his head
Then that nigga dead
That’s what happen when you talk to feds

[Verse 4: Rich The Kid]
Pussy dripping, leave her leaking
I put that bitch in Chanel
I’ma fuck her in designer
I’ma put it right behind her
Bet a quarter milly in a week, ayy
Geeking on molly, can’t sleep
Then I crashed the Maserati twice
You won’t make this much in one life
