[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]

Fuck a fake nigga, I can die by myself
I only drive in sport, cuz the faster the better
Basketball seats, I got NBA leather
Shoot a nigga quick, if he fuck with my cheddar
Niggas yelling whip, but they not in the kitchen
Niggas swear they crippin' till they see the blood drippin'
Nah, I don't bang, but I hang with the shooters
They look over me like DJ Esco do future
I say stick to myself, cuz these niggas pussy
Pussys only pussy, don’t you disrespect me for no pussy
I can see it in your eyes, you broke as hell
Sitting, waiting for the day the homie bet you with the bail
We don’t front, you won’t get fronted if you ain’t known
Said your face, car, good but you don’t leave your home
Got this Carly red bitch sittin’ in my home
Ima blow her back out and send her ass home
Ice, neck, wrist, watch crazy though
Ugly black nigga straight snatchin’ hoes
Costa Rica hoes
Put the beam on him now he lookin’ Hindu
I don’t fuck with ‘em, unless they payin’ first
Nigga run up on ‘em with that, 40
Lil Yachty bitch I’m uh, boring


[Verse 2: K$upreme]

Red dot on his head, now he lookin’ Hindu
These niggas fufu
Scottie Pippin 33 shot, aimed right at you
Nigga come through with the purple drink (leanin’)
I be off the goop, I be out the booth
And my backwood, (?) with the boof
Skinny nigga smoke a lotta weed, like I’m Snoop
And I’m chasin dreams, R.I.P. Lil Snupe (Damn)
Pull up in that all blue, pour a four in the muhfuckin’ Mountain Dew
I be high, like the mountains too
I told that bitch to lay it off my roof
Hop in my coupe, let off that roof
And I only want the top, nicknamed your roof


[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]

I’m in LA whippin Reese, sippin juicy juice
Hanging by a noose, on my master shit
Kick him in a pit, on my trojan shit
You niggas make me laugh, on some Seth Rogan shit
Double (?) bitch, yeah ima fold the bitch


[Verse 4: K$upreme]

In my hand a 30 jock
In my hand a 30 Glock, nicknamed it 40 Glock
Meet me fucking kitchen, do you smell what I’m cooking, like the rock
