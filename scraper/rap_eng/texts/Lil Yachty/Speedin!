[Chorus: Pollàri]
They want me speeding, dreaming, fiending
Your love, I'm falling in
Speeding, dreaming, fiending
Your love, I'm falling in

[Verse 1: Pollàri]
I'ma just run up a check, ayy
Diamonds they dance on my neck, ayy
She wanna ride like a valet
He dance on the work like it's ballet
Look at these niggas, they crossing
Baby girl know I'm a boss and
She wanna ride in the foreign
Her last nigga was boring

[Chorus: Pollàri]
They want me speeding, dreaming, fiending
Your love, I'm falling in
Speeding, dreaming, fiending
Your love, I'm falling in

[Chorus 2: Pollàri]
Why do these hoes think they special?
I might just pull in a Tesla, hey
My niggas they might just press you, hey
My niggas they might just press you, hey
Threaten me, I'ma just bless you, hey
But I will not come to your rescue, ayy
All of these hoes think they special, ayy
All of these hoes think they special, ayy
All of my hoes, they so special, ayy
All of my boos, they so special, ayy
All of my hoes, they so special, ayy
All of my hoes, they so special, ayy

All of my boos, they so special, ayy
All of my boos, they so special, ayy
All of my hoes, they so special, ayy

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
(Lil Boat, huh)
Money sit tall like Jenga blocks
Finesse the plug with a straight drop
Work on them [?], you straight talk
Pull up on 'em and we take the top
You know Lil Boat 'bout his money
Big Yachty don't pay for nothing, huh
Flying world 'round like a Bunyan, huh
Sold Dirty Diana, them onions
Huh, woah
I run it up like I'm Warrick Dunn
I brought a clip, look like three guns
Pay [?] to strip, I need two or none'
Can't send a scammer to school, huh
Living my life with no rules, huh
I stood inside 'cause it's cool, huh
Lil Boat, Lil Boat

[Verse 3: Larry League]
Megaman Randy, I'ma hit you with the stuff
You a jive ass turkey, Randy hit you with the stuff
I got bands in my safe, fly away, Randy blue tape
You don't beef with Randy ahh, you might raise the stakes
Randy be getting it off of the stove
Put in my oven, I'm baking a cake
Putting a pint in the Fanta
A liter is not even safe
Polly in my pocket, Randy smart like he in college
Caught a case, I'ma skate like Tony Hawk
Fuck a cop, ayy

[Chorus 2: Pollàri]
