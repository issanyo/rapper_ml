[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Burnin' it up by the hundreds, I can't be forgotten
Spent thousands of dollars on this, this ain't cotton
These niggas be jocking, I'm bringing the stock in
Lil shawty why'd you break my heart?
Stabbed me right with a dart
Now you see me on the TV and you tryna get back to the start
I saw the green light and proceeded to go go go
I tried to escape from your beauty but I saw your fine ass at the store, damn
I fell out deeper than you, now my life is so blue
I really don't know what to do, I was stuck on you like glue
Tick of the time, you run through my mind, I made me a plan
22 diamonds they shine every day
You'll go blind my nigga, my neck cold as a fan, yeah
I'm giving up on your love, fuck what they say, you a dub
I give a fuck 'bout you 'cause I really had me enough

[Pre-Chorus: The Skins]
And you hit me with your love
(And my walls came crashing, my walls came crashing)
You hit me with your love
(And I feel so broken, I keep on choking)
You hit me with your love
(And my walls came crashing, my walls came crashing)
You hit me with your love
(Take me down)

[Chorus: The Skins]
Bury me
(In yo yo yo, yo yo yo love)
Bury me
(In yo yo yo, yo yo yo love)
Bury me
(In yo yo yo, yo yo yo love)
Bury me
(In yo yo yo, yo yo yo love)

[Verse 2: Nessly]
Fresh blood on my shirt
Shoveling the front trim, um
Tryna maneuver this foreign through the two miles
You fightin', arguin', fussin', I'ma tryna fight for survival
Tryna push this Porsche through the weather
Right now I need your support more than ever
I'm going through an on-going battle with the devil
I'm tryna face it, I ain't tryna let the feelings settle
I got plans of copping a condo on Mars with you
Crop them braids out the picture, we come up better Christian
You made me want to restudy my religion
We both made a killing, they gon' wanna push us to prison
So we stop, so we start
That's just sins, right or left, would go down if we give up
Find a quiet place to fuck
When the sun comes back up we'll be back on the run

[Verse 3: Jazz Cartier]
See this situation is far from average
I'm on that midnight train to Georgia
Every now and then I try to get in touch with Gladys
I'm stuck in Hollywood where everybody 'round me plastic
I always wanted power, the girls just want my status
I wore my heart on my sleeve, I cut my scars to match it
See my anxieties cool, with you I often panic
Maybe I'll see you next lifetime on another planet
I thought you had my back but now I'm target practice
A million sorries later, and yeah we're still a mess
I wish that I could fix it with a call or just a simple text
My palms are wet, searching for an answer in this cigarette
Feel free to take whatever's left, but I'm still JLF

[Pre-Chorus: The Skins & D.R.A.M.]
And you hit me with your love
(And my walls came crashing, my walls came crashing)
You hit me with you love
(And I feel so broken, I keep on choking)
You hit me with your love
(And my walls came crashing, my walls came crashing)
You hit me with your love
(Take me down)

[Chorus: The Skins]
Bury me
(In yo yo yo, yo yo yo love)
Bury me
(In yo yo yo, yo yo yo love)
Bury me
(In yo yo yo, yo yo yo love)
Bury me
(In yo yo yo, yo yo yo love)

[Bridge: The Skins & D.R.A.M.]
Only losers love and only lovers lose
Baby I wish you knew that we could break the rules
Only losers love and only lovers lose, babe
I thought you were the one who loved to break the rules

[Chorus: The Skins & D.R.A.M.]
Bury me
(In yo yo yo, yo yo yo love)
Bury me
(In yo yo yo, yo yo yo love)
Bury me
(In yo yo yo, yo yo yo love)
Bury me
(In yo yo yo, yo yo yo love)

[Chorus: The Skins]
Bury me
(In yo yo yo, yo yo yo love)
Bury me
(In yo yo yo, yo yo yo love)
Bury me
(In yo yo yo, yo yo yo love)
Bury me
(In yo yo yo, yo yo yo love)
