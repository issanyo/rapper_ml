[Intro]
808 my crew

[Chorus]
Big Beemers, send a nigga to the cleaners
Have a nigga shirt wet, big Benz make a bitch have sex
I just wanna catch the neck, I just wanna catch the neck
Private party bitch buckle down
Yeah you fucking with them clowns, come and fuck with a boss
All W's bitch, we don't take losses
Whole neck, wrist, fucking faucets

[Verse]
Big Benz, big Benz for my friends
Bought a big Beemer, that shit changed my demeanor
In that lil' Porsche, doing twenty 'round the course
I'm a big boss, can't fuck with none of you lil' boys
Ah, oh yeah!
Ayy, eighteen years broke, now the rest I'ma run it up
Dick in her mouth like the tip of a sippy cup
Purple and green like the motherfuckin' mighty ducks
Fucked her one time, she in love, that's that Midas touch
Fuck being humble that shit just don't work for me
Fuck her one time now that bitch tryna work for me
(Pack my bags ho)
Uh, top of the condo I look like a king
Five karats all on my ring (money)
High school spent most of my time with the dean
In the hallway serving beans
Why these niggas 'flauging, prolly cause my neck hoggin

[Chorus]
Big Beemers, send a nigga to the cleaners
Have a nigga shirt wet, big Benz make a bitch have sex
I just wanna catch the neck, I just wanna catch the neck
Private party bitch buckle down
Yeah you fucking with them clowns, come and fuck with a boss
All W's bitch, we don't take losses
Whole neck, wrist, fucking faucets
