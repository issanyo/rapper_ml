[Intro]
How brave do I become when truly loved?
My overwhelmin' feels are overcome
I might even hit the blunt
And I don't do that for anyone, no
Ooh
I think I'ma dance for the first time in a long time
Ooh
I might even laugh like I mean it
Come on, baby, say it like you mean it
You gonna be alright, baby
Alright
You know you're gonna be fine
You're gonna be alright, baby

[Verse 1]
Hey Kyle, how you doin'?
What is this dream you're pursuin'?
What are these feelings you mention? (what?)
Are you from a different dimension? (are you?)
My nigga, do you have dementia?
Why is you rappin' 'bout happy?
Think about all the bad shit that happens (ya)
You know that inside, you feel crappy
Okay, yeah, how did you guess?
Skrrt, I am a wreck
I set a record for bein' upset
Truthfully, honestly, I am a mess
I am depressed, I am obsessed
With self-deprecating and blamin' myself
Socially lyin', denyin' the help
I'm holdin' up like pants missing a belt
But it ain't so bad (no, no)
Look what I be on
I'm on TV, mom
My nigga, I am a phenom
My chick is out o' this world
Yeah, badder than Zenon
When I need somebody to lean on
I put that Cudi CD on
In my spare time
Punchin' walls, fuckin' up my hand
I know that shit sounds super cray
But if you had this life, you'd understand

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything's a lot o' up and down
But I ain't gonna let it get me down
No (no no)

[Chorus]
(Ups, and downs)
(No!)
Ups, and downs
(Yo, ayy)

[Verse 2]
2016 hit me like a bag o' bricks (yup)
2017 switched up, like ooh it's lit (it's lit!)
I nearly had a mental breakdown
And eight months later had a hit (yup)
I guess life is like box a chocolates, huh
You never know what you finna get
Haha, yeah
Think about this 'fore your flip
There's always two sides o' the coin
Tell my man you gotta keep goin'
You blessed nigga, you don't even know it
Sittin' there, lookin' all stoic, hmm
Be stiff, you should be stoked, hmm
You can smile, even if you broke, yo
You could be a Budden or a Boat, true
Yeah
Trust me, believe me, I been there too
Down on my luck, I was just like you
Singin' the same damn sad old song
Boo hoo (yeah)
But you'll be fine
It'll all be fine
It's just in your mind
Yep

[Chorus]
(Ups, and downs)
Ups, and downs

[Skit: KYLE & Lil Yachty]
Lil lil lil lil Boat, Lil Boat Lil Boat, Lil Boat
Yo, yo, wassup buddy?
It's your conscience!
My, my conscience?
Yeah, you know, th-the voice in your head that tells you when you fuckin' up?
Like uh, Jiminy Cricket?
Ugh yes, like Jiminy Cricket, you Disney ass motherfucker
N-Now listen up, man. You gotta leave that negativity shit in the past. That shit is old, bro. How you supposed to grow up, if you ain't even glowed up?
Uh, what, what the fuck are you talkin' about?
Ah, don't trip dawg, follow me. I'ma show you. You coming?
