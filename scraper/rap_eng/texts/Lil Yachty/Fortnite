[Intro: Baka Not Nice]
Murda on the beat so it's not nice

[Chorus: Yung Bans & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Yeah, gang, bitch, I'm with the gang (Bans)
With the squad, gang, got the whole squad, ayy (gang)
Yeah, push up on them niggas, let my nuts hang (hang)
Yeah, ridin' with the 40 with the fuckin' flame, huh (fuckin' flame)
And I got the SCAR (SCAR, yup)
Y'all niggas don't want war (pew, water!)
Y'all niggas don't want war (war, war)
What you came here for? (war, yeah)
I'm in-I'm in Tilted Towers (ooh, Tilted Towers) 
(yeah, shout-out my, huh, ooh) Look like Austin Powers (huh)
Get your bitch plowing, Diamonds with the shower (uhh, ok)

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Keep a lot of chicken I'm Popeyes'd up
Doubling it up like I do my cup
Boogie Bomb down when I'm with your slut
She be acting like a squirrel tryna get my nut
Thinkin' I am Bans in a new Benz truck
And I bought a crib, nigga get your land up
Gucci feather slipper, so I'm walking on duck
And I'm not tryna fuck, 'cause I only want suck
My pockets as fat as Wario
And he's tryna see how far he go
Pickin' out a hoe like eenie meenie mo
When they like a nigga like a video on Vevo
You could get jammed up like a big toe
Give your ass a Stitch, but no Lilo
Your girl is a bird, yes on the d-low
'Cause she act like an ostrich, gimme deep throat
We could make a deal, Rumpelstiltskin (stiltskin)
But I keep the metal like a beer can (beer can)
Think you're gonna rob me, nigga think again (think again)
How much is you tryna make, a billion (a billion!)
Stack it all the way up to the ceiling (ceiling)
Like I'm Rockefeller in the building (building)
What is this feeling that I'm feeling (feeling)
Feeling the bitch pussy on my foreskin

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
Yeah, gang, bitch, I'm with the gang
With the squad, gang, got the whole squad, ayy
Yeah, push up on 'em niggas, let my nuts hang
Yeah, ridin' with the 40 with the fuckin' flame, huh (fuckin' flame)
And I got the SCAR
Y'all niggas don't want war
Y'all niggas don't want war
What you came here for? (yeah)
I'm in Tilted Towers (ooh, Tilted Towers)
Look like Austin Powers (huh)
Get your bitch plowing
Diamonds with the shower

[Verse 2: Yung Bans]
Pull that choppa out my jeans
Spray that nigga like Febreze
Heard lil' bro was talkin' shit
I'ma push up before he leave
Nigga why you tryna play?
Like you can't get touched
'Cause we ran up on your squad and they all got bust
1 of 1 the gang and they said I trust
Dog a nigga's slut imma make her blush
You can see that I'm the shit I got in Flush
My whole gang crush, you talkin' smoke we bustin'

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Gang, gang (gang)
Pull up with a stupid stick, baby, let them toolies tick
Hope you brought your cooling kit, talking down we poppin' shit
Kick em in a mosh My bitch geeked off Asher Roth
Baby stop that talkin', all that talkin' make me soft
Piercings on her nipples, how 'bout I hop in Lacoste
Drippin' too much sauce, jumpin' in the pussy, it's a wishing well
Hope you wish me well, keep a AK cause these niggas hell, Lil Boat

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
Yeah, gang, bitch, I'm with the gang
With the squad, gang, got the whole squad, ayy
Yeah, push up on 'em niggas, let my nuts hang
Yeah, ridin' with the 40 with the fuckin' flame, huh (fuckin' flame)
And I got the SCAR
Y'all niggas don't want war
Y'all niggas don't want war
What you came here for? (yeah)
I'm in Tilted Towers (ooh, Tilted Towers)
Look like Austin Powers (huh)
Get your bitch plowing
Diamonds with the shower
