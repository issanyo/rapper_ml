[Introduction: Lil Yachty]
I got so much money on me right now
I swear to god I'm a walking bank it's a goddamn shame
My momma want me to put my money in the motherfucking bank account because I got damn-- goddamn too much money
But I said no mom I need the money on me now
I gotta hold it, I gotta touch it, don't do it
I gotta have the racks on me
They sayin (Just Juice)

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Everyday I used to clean my Benz
I always work so I got up and ran and got it
I don't think no more I just fuckin count it
I don't look when I buy I just buy it
Everyday I used to clean my Benz
I always work so I got up and ran and got it
I don't think no more I just fuckin count it
I don't look when I buy I just buy it
I made it I made it
Rich as fuck and I made it
Did it while everyone hated
Rich as fuck and I made it
I made it I made it
Rich as fuck and I made it
Did it while everyone hated (Yeah)
Rich as fuck and I made it (I made it)

[Verse 1: Just Juice]
[?] I'm with it I'm moving
So a couple of chicks in the whip and we cruising like
Ain't no way that they gonna nuke my vibe
Ain't no way that they gonna move my tribe
All I wanted was a hundred millie
Honeys with me you could hardly feel me
All I wanted was my girl to hear me
Went for granted now she can't get near me
Counting these commas
Run up on [?] and we breaking it down
[?]
Where was you back when there no one around
This is the come up
You know that it's going down
This is the come up
You know that it's going down
