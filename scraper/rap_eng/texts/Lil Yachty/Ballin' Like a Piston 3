[Intro: Lil Yachty]
I gotta tell ya Chad, feel good to be back in this bitch
My nigga C.J. in this bitch with me

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I make you niggas uncomfortable, I can tell that y'all truly not feelin' me
12 just kicked in my back door, but my brother already stashed in the ceiling, b
This isn't the first or the second, my nigga this shit right here, this is the trilogy
She off the molly, so she into me
Without the molly, trust me, she still into me
Feelin like Drake with the enemies
Leveled up, I got the energy
You the Castro of catastrophe
I'm in the sky like astronomy, trust me I know y'all not finding me
That pussy is wet like a pond to me
My D.J. is Deano from 6 OD and he spin it back that's the recipe
Got an extra key for locked doors
Where the bad whores get fucked good
9/10 my niggas ain't gonna smoke with you if it ain't no Backwoods
I ran it up like I said I would
I fucked that bitch on the cardboard
All of my niggas from wish-you-woods
They totin' clips like a hard drive

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Money's lookin' good, but now I'm really really ballin'
I was up before but now I'm really really ballin'
Ballin' like a Piston, bitch I'm ballin' like a Piston

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Ballin' like the Piston's owner
Why you acting like a loner?
Niggas swear they be "skrr skrr" but when they hop in my whip, they be scared
None of my fights have been fair
Either got jumped
Or I jumped on a player
Took one L in my life but I promise, it won't happen no more
Got the choppa sittin' on the floor
Imma bust in at a nigga nose
I got way too, way too many hoes, chain on my neck, yeah, this shit real gold
I need to start doing more shows
I need to start buying more clothes
I already got a lot of clothes
But nigga I want more clothes
This shit here is flex music (huh)
Nigga gon' and flex to it (huh)
Double cup drinkin' fluids
Flyest shit, nigga you knew it
Nut on her face just like cool whip
Dive in that pussy like pool dip
Alot of these bitches say Yachty is igorant
But I can not change cause that shit is foolish
(Ahhh!)
