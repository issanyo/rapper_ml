[Chorus: Valee]
Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm
I'm somewhere with a famous skyline
My OG gas sound like an echo (Hmmm)
I treat a bitch better than PetCo (PetCo)
My two-door belong in an expo
It's red like a new jar of RAGÚ
I'm sittin' on a plane, but not by you
My window seat, Erykah Badu
You know I can't tell a bitch, "I do"
You can't show these niggas what you do
They watchin' your pocket like YouTube
I pull up in it straight, no, I don't need no tune-up
Stay down the street from where I grew up
I got a duffle, put the blue up (Put the blue up)

[Verse 1: Valee]
Two Adderalls, I got three of those in me
Been up for three days and still feel like I'm fresh up
I'm thinkin' 'bout icin' my neck up
I fuck her while she got her leg up
I fuck her like I'm on Viagra
My Vlone shirt same color ketchup
I ride 26s, you bet ya (Bet ya)
Yeah, I'm on MLK like Coretta (Mmm)
She suckin' me up a lil' better (Mmm)
I hold her hair back like a barrette (Mmm)
At the spot with your bitch, watchin' Borat (Yeah)
She hittin' my phone, I ignore that

[Chorus: Valee]
Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm
I'm somewhere with a famous skyline
My OG gas sound like an echo (Hmmm)
I treat a bitch better than PetCo (PetCo)
My two-door belong in an expo
It's red like a new jar of RAGÚ
I'm sittin' on a plane, but not by you
My window seat, Erykah Badu
You know I can't tell a bitch, "I do"
You can't show these niggas what you do
They watchin' your pocket like YouTube
I pull up in it straight, no, I don't need no tune-up
Stay down the street from where I grew up
I got a duffle, put the blue up (Put the blue up)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I donate big racks where I grew up
They know ain't no secret, I blew up (Cool)
My bitch pussy smell like a tulip
My oldest car still ain't hit fifth grade (Yeah)
It's still kinda new, change the paint shade (Skrrt)
I go get it tinted with esés (Wow)
I'm in the 'Nolia eatin' beignets (Wow)
This ice on my risk don't get risqué (Wow)
We got us a section in Magic on Monday
The waitress know today's a tip day (Facts)
She said it's her period, that's cool
I didn't wanna fuck, it's a lip day (Cool)
I spent like three thousand on fragrance (Cool)
I smell like the Powerball lotto (Wow)
Bitch from France like biscotti and gelato (Yeah)
She call a tomato tom-ah-to (Wow)
She still know that money's the motto (Yeah)
My watch cost the same as a Tahoe (Skrrt)
My merch gettin' made with Bravado (Cool)
She suckin' dick, I say, "Bravo" (Yeah)
I might just record what we do and go sell it to Bravo (Cool)
I'm stuck in two hoes like a taco (Wow)
Got cheese on my top like a nacho (Cool)
Lil Boat
