[Intro]
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted in my life was a sack though
Brother locked up in the county, kicking backdoors
Yeah you pourin' fours but I know that's not act, no
I know you not playa cause your bitch got your passcode

[Verse 1]
I brought my moms out, I'm still gon' show my ass though
Put that standard clip inside the slut where the MAC go
Late night tryna fall up in that pussy like a pothole
You won't smoke them shits, it's goin' down, call me Jacques bro
Yeah, I'm a dog with a sack bro
I'ma catch the [?] in the condom and I can't fold
All up on my [?] in the diamonds with the yellow gold
Runnin' up them yards with the sack like a football coach

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted in my life was a sack though
Brother locked up in the county, kicking backdoors
Yeah you pourin' fours but I know that's not act, no
I know you not playa cause your bitch got your passcode
All I ever wanted in my life was a sack though
Brother locked up in the county, kicking backdoors
Yeah you pourin' fours but I know that's not act, no
I know you not playa cause your bitch got your passcode
