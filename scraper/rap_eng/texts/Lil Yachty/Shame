[Intro: Larry]
Chop, chopping, and I might just break you off
What he pushing lame, the truth can't feed that to my dogs

[Intro 2: DJ SCREAM]
This the legendary DJ SCREAM speaking
This the new movement, the new wave
LARRY LEAGUE motherfuckers
It's time to take off let's go

[Verse 1: Larry]
I know they smelling me
Fuck what he telling me
Pain where the pleasure be
Yung Bois go flex for me
Chop, chopping, and I might just break you off
What he pushing lame the truth can't feed that to my dogs
Trap pad is posh, I'm pouring drop up on the rocks
When I start to glo I'll watch 'em fly just like some moths
If I brought you just bought it and that's half of what I got
It's a god damn shame they just lost they whole clout

[Verse 2: Lil' Yachty]
It's a god damn shame you lost all your clout
It's a god damn shame your pockets in a drought
It's a god damn shame you try to plot on me
It's a god damn shame I'll have to wet your tee
Said these niggas think he's sweet cause the beads in my hair
I'll fuck a nigga bitch with these beads in my hair
I'll beat a nigga ass with these beads in my hair
Carve a nigga like a pumpkin if he get an assumption
Cherry red whip slide in when I come to the function
And my wrist cost a grip you can tell I'm stunting
And my bitch lips brown you can tell she been blunting
I cannot fuck with insta-niggas cause these niggas be fronting

[Chorus: Larry]
It's a shame, It's a shame, It's a god damn shame
We be taking what we get so we get what we take
It's a shame, It's a shame, It's a god damn shame
Young boys late, couldn't wait, get the hell out my face

[Verse 3: Randy]
I just took your shit, who to blame, who to blame
Fame just popped up in my face I couldn't wait
Crop, crop, crop, yeah that's all I fucking flip
Randy fucking pilot on these bitches landing strip
North Atlanta, North Atlanta, you ain't from North Atlanta
Pulled up blind side, Sandra Bullock in my fanta
Why I always stunt? I be drunk just like your aunt
Yachty got a rifle like we going on a hunt

[Verse 4: SenseiATL]
This Bentley, ain't friendly
That work is savvy
Bitch chase my like Chevy
Finnesed her already
Hit a fucking lick and then I move
Fucked your main bitch then I snooze
Smoking on this dope, you can call me Carl Wheezer
Looking hella icy I just came up out the freezer
Fucked my money up catch me stroking through the check
My shooter cold blooded like he came from Quebec
