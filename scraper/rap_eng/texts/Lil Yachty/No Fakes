[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Percy got me stumblin'
[?]
Old niggas mad sayin' that we mumblin'
Get the fuck up out my face
I'm just tryna get to the cake
I'm in the crib with a pole, fuck that
I'm in the crib with a [?]
[?]
Fu-fu-fuck 12, watch out for the [?]
Fake love, fake love, and I love they hate
These niggas ain't real, I know they fake
Better watch yo step, better stay in yo place

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD & Lil Yachty]
Sorry
I been drippin' so hard as of lately
If I ever go broke [?]
Chasing
Just a young shot caller, blunt blazing
She ask me if I'm high, bitch I'm blessed
Fuck her 'til her eyes roll back, she posessed
Makin' bad money like I'm selling crystal meth
Baby girl was black and white, like a shirt [?]
Let me put my hands [?]
Fuckin' with a nigga like me, you'll get obsessed
I'm young, but I'm ready
Dancin' like DeeDee
Gettin' served like spaghetti
And my bro Corvette is no [?]
Sharp like machetes
I just want the Nike
