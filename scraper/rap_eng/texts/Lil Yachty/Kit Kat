Earl on the beat, Earl on the beat

Damn, this recording me?

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Used to sell lean, nigga don’t got no six pack
Got some new two diamonds too, cost me six racks
Put on her neck, that shit sound like a Kit Kat

Hit out the park like I'm Jeter (Uh)

[Verse 2: Asian Doll]
I’m up, I’m up, pockets is stuffed
Pretty bitch walk with a mug
Get to the bucks, Crippin', I’m banging with cuz
Diamonds, they flooded my slug
Nigga fantasize how you really wanna eat it
Bitches in the mirror, looking like they wanna be me
Independent signed to the Doll, I don't milly
Pussy tighten up, every stroke, nigga feel it
Ride with a shooter, you know my shooters salute
Lil Kim then he booty get turned to a noodle
Take a bitch finesse at the Hooters
Ran up a check with a scooter
Headshot in medulla
You know I ride with a beam
Lil bro gon' fuck up the scene
Your nigga fiend
Turned that lil bitch to a meanie
Pockets on green
Poured up a four, I'm on lean
Niggas say the gang, leave these niggas on flat
Niggas sneak diss, hit his ass with the MAC
’Bout that blue money, got these old niggas mad
White bitch, lunch day, we be chatting 'bout the sack
Pop out with bitches like bats
Ride out and crash out a 'Rari with Jxmmi, that's facts
Verses don't do it, I tax
I'm bougie, finessing the come up, these lil bitches mad
