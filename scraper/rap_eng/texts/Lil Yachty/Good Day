[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Man today's a good day
Cause I'm rich, rich, rich, rich
Walking down the street and I just copped a big booty bitch
Man today's a good day
Hey, ay-ye-ay-ye-ay
Cause I'm rich, rich, rich, rich
And these diamonds on my wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Man today's a good day
Hey, ay-ye-ay-ye-ay
Cause I'm rich

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Today I don't have any haters
Cause I could care less what they saying
Cause I'm having a good day
Hey, ay-ye-ay-ye-ay
I just check my bank account and there's so many O's
I could give a mother fuck about any these hoes
Cause I am rich, rich, rich, I'm rich
I give a fuck about a bitch, a biatch
Oh, I know, I just sold a show
Park my car in the wrong spot but it still ain't get towed

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Cause I'm rich, rich, rich, rich
Walking down the street and I just copped a big booty bitch
Man today's a good day
Hey, ay-ye-ay-ye-ay
Cause I'm rich, rich, rich, rich
And these diamonds on my wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Man today's a good day
Hey, ay-ye-ay-ye-ay
Cause I'm rich

[Verse 2: Skippa Da Flippa]
Mo' money mo' problems
But I cherish every moment cause I came from the bottom
Cop moms a coup√© cause my bank so colossal
Me and Yachty on a yacht, we pop a hunnid bottles
And I'm rich ya bitch
Catch me in the Fisker going crazy as I change the gears to 6
Every day's a good day only if you're living rich
Holding blue hunnids, a hella good mix
I feel good today, I might cop a sting-ray
I love to get paid and she watch me Blu Ray
I got 5 different hustles, so get money 5 ways
I'm up 24 hours and grind 7 days
Flippa!

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Cause I'm rich, rich, rich, rich
Walking down the street and I just copped a big booty bitch
Man today's a good day
Hey, ay-ye-ay-ye-ay
Cause I'm rich, rich, rich, rich
And these diamonds on my wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Man today's a good day
Hey, ay-ye-ay-ye-ay
Cause I'm rich
