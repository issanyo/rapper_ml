[Chorus]
It's Young Boat, put a nigga in they place
Rich as fuck, out the window, free Tay-K
First show I did I got less than 10K
Saw Tay-K, now he who he is today

[Verse]
All that fake gangbanging get you slayed
Think you hard, you get robbed for your chain
Nigga snatch my chain, that's a man down, mayday
In a race bitch, always first place
Nah for real bitch, first place always
Shout out Diego Money, Mitch, and Lil Jay
SKTDDG, that's always
Free Big Reese, they're tryna give him more days
Never been shot and truthfully I do not want to
If she not fuckin', boy respect that she don't want you
Say fuck the bitch and keep it movin' 'fore it haunt you
Don't fuck many, circle tighter than a bantu, let's get it
Hate these niggas, they fake weird and they fake emo
I'm 'bout my money, give a fuck about your friendzone
These niggas tryna clique it up and run against me
I have respect but now it's nothing else against me
Had that truck buck, I turned it to a tar heel
She ride dick like a bike, wheelie back wheel
They say don't fuck your homie bitch, that's a no-no
I took my old homie bitch and kicked it dolo
Told my nigga's mom I'm sorry, yeah he still broke (bye bye)
But buddy got up in his feelings so it's fuck bro
She pop six, now she ride dick like a Volvo
And snorting way more lines than a barcode
I'm not buckin' but I'm ready with the arsenal
Hit his chest, now his name in an article

[Chorus]
It's Young Boat, put a nigga in they place
Rich as fuck out the window, free Tay-K
First show I did I got less than 10K
Saw Tay-K, now he who he is today
See it in my mother-fuckin' face (Lil' Boat)
