[Chorus: Nebu Kiniza]
Wake up in the morning gotta count my cash (x6)
Tonight let's ride (x2)
Wake up in the morning gotta count my cash
Wake up in the morning gotta count my cash
Wake up in the morning gotta count my cash tonight, tonight

[Verse 1: Nebu Kiniza]
She know I'm on one
Never loosen up gotta get a new grip
Always on the go never ever in the mix
Always on the road gotta count that shit, yah
Wake up in the morning
She know that I'm on it
She know that I'm, yeah
Fucking up a check and I get it right back
All up in the mix why you do it like that
I ain't even mean to really do em like that, damn
John Doe, Rondo, balling in my condo
Why you in my convo, for?
Racks on me got back on me
I don't do shit for free
All on me yeah all on me I swear that girl a freak

[Chorus: Nebu Kiniza]
Wake up in the morning gotta count my cash (x6)
Tonight let's ride (x2)
Wake up in the morning gotta count my cash
Wake up in the morning gotta count my cash
Wake up in the morning gotta count my cash tonight, tonight

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Wake up in the morning gotta fuck my bitch
Call it icebox new ice, left wrist
Nigga talking down 'Imma fuck his sis
Nigga talking down 'Imma fuck his bi-atch
You ride around with your brand new fianc√©
In a Fiat bumping brand new Beyonce
Me and my niggas ride round in a Benz
Two Asian hoes screaming at their best friends
They don't even know each other
Niggas love looking at me like I owe 'em somethin'
Niggas love calling my phone just to loan 'em somethin'
How the fuck you get my new number? I changed it
Fuck niggas love saying Boat changed up nigga I ain't change shit
New chain Imma swang it
New ring 'Imma bling it out
Bitch nigga talking we 'gon knock him out
Pussy ass nigga keep running his mouth
Lil' boat about his cheese
Sing those, c-notes please

[Chorus:Nebu Kiniza]
Wake up in the morning gotta count my cash (x6)
Tonight let's ride (x2)
Wake up in the morning gotta count my cash
Wake up in the morning gotta count my cash
Wake up in the morning gotta count my cash tonight, tonight
