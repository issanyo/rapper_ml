[Intro: Lil Yatchy & Lil_Moloko
Bad news
Pew!
Summersongs 2
Yeah
Drop top
Drop top flexin

[Hook]
Drop top flexin'
Four hoes, three seats in my whip
Drop top flexin'
Not worried, I'm not stressin'
Drop top flexin'
Four hoes, three seats left in my whip
Summertime is here
So I'm not worried, no I'm not stressin'
I'mma ride around with my friends
Not worried about what I gotta do tomorrow
Ride around with my friends
And hope and pray that we all live to see tomorrow
[Verse]
Tuss be pourin' trees
Party till the sun comes up
All my homies stayin' with me like they lease was up
Summertime is here
Pull your titties out and dont have no fear
June to September
We got many nights to remember
Talkin' 'bout hot sex in the back seat
And runnin' high speed from the police, ohh

[Hook]
Drop top flexin'
Four hoes, three seats in my whip
Drop top flexin'
Not worried, I'm not stressin'
Drop top flexin'
Four hoes, three seats left in my whip
Summertime is here
So I'm not worried, no I'm not stressin'
I'mma ride around with my friends
Not worried about what I gotta do tomorrow
Ride around with my friends
And hope and pray that we all live to see tomorrow
