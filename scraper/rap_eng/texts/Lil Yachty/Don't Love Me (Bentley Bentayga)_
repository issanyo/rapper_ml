[Intro]
Bentley Bentayga, Bentley Coupe, two-lane
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney
One hundred thousand, loose change
Ayy, woah

[Verse]
Bentley Bentayga, Bentley Coupe, two-lane
One hundred thousand, loose change
I got a bad lil bit from the blue flame
She hopped on dick instantly when the crew came
Don't stand to close, we might blow like it's propane
Nosy ass nigga probably do cocaine
I'm on these old nigga's heads just like road game (fiendin')
She take that dick just like morphine

[Pre-Chorus]
I gotta leave her alone, she ain't right
I gotta leave her alone, she ain't right
Sippin' on Sprite, put her to night-night
Rockin' that ice in the club, that's a night light
I just might skeet in that bitch if it's too tight
No cap, I pop PB's like Mickey D's
I just get stuck, that pussy on seven seas
I gotta stop, these bitches don't love me

[Chorus]
These bitches don't love me, no!
These bitches don't love me, no!
These bitches don't love me, hell no!
Up in Magic, I'm Elon Musk
They know I got bags, trust
Try to rob me, all you see is the gun dust
Crib real big like a camp bus

[Pre-Chorus]
I gotta leave her alone, she ain't right
I gotta leave her alone, she ain't right
Sippin' on Sprite, put her to night-night
Rockin' that ice in the club, that's a night light
I just might skeet in that bitch if it's too tight
No cap, I pop PB's like Mickey D's
I just get stuck, that pussy on seven seas
I gotta stop, these bitches don't love me

[Chorus]
These bitches don't love me, no!
These bitches don't love me, no!
These bitches don't love me, hell no!
Up in Magic, I'm Elon Musk
They know I got bags, trust
Try to rob me, all you see is the gun dust
Crib real big like a camp bus
