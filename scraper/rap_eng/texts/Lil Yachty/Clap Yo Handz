[Intro: Yung Sailor]
SWCB in this bitch
Sailor, yuh

[Verse 1: Yung Sailor]
Palms hurt, fingers hurt, ass hurt too
Clapping on the bench, echo run-22
Look at the side
Coach giving me the eye
I ain’t got no choice now it’s clap or die
Up and down the bench man no one clapping
Gotta take the blame since I'm the captain
Can no longer take it
Gonna have to fake it
It’s taking a toll don’t know if I can make it
Down by 25 man that’s tuff
Still the bench energy not enough
Sailor you better get them loud right now
I am the leader of the crowd
It’s time to make the coaches proud
Time to clap it up bench get up let's sound
It’s the end of the game
That's all it takes
But we still lost by 25 oh that’s great
Head into the locker room damn okay
Raise your hand, everyone’s got something to say
Since we couldn’t execute a simple play
Tomorrow I guess we’ll be running all day
Starters say oh the bench could’ve been better
Bitch I was clapping for what felt like forever
Try trading places with me for a game
Promise all the clappings gonna be in vain

Every other day our team gets schlonged
Then we come together thinking hmm what’s wrong?
Stop with the bullshit this debate is pointless
Play the right starters and the others be scoreless
Boardless, soreness, yeah they'd have to forfeit
But with your shitty coaching we're the ones looking poorest
It’s your own damn fault that you’re losing your job
Not meant for the bench feels like I'm getting robbed
But in the mean time I’ll just clap my hands
Might as well be in the fucking stands

[Verse 2: Big Fat Boy & 𝘠𝘶𝘯𝘨 𝘚𝘢𝘪𝘭𝘰𝘳]
Said I was fat now I’m transformed can’t win a game cause your brains malformed
6 foot center thanks for that
Go up like a damn, acrobat
But I still get blocked
If I make it I’m shocked
Said if it gets knocked into the stands
Where I wanna be with the fans
But coach has different plans
Not my fault you don’t know what to do
Every single player knows its true
At the start of the year I already knew this would be an another losing season
And guess what? (𝘢𝘺𝘦)
You’re the reason
