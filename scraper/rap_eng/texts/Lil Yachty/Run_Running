[Part 1: Run]

[Intro]
Young nigga just ran the sac the up
Young nigga just ran the sac the up
Young nigga just ran the sac the up
Young nigga just ran the sac the up
Young nigga just ran the sac the up
Young nigga just ran the sac the up

[Chorus]
Run my sac up
Run my sac up

[Verse 1]
I think I just raised the leverage
Purple codeine in my beverage
I'm from the 6 that's where I stay
Fuck with my gang you gon' get slayed
And I promise everything on me is good enough
He can't be NAZ cause that nigga not rich enough
And I can see it in his eye that nigga is broke
I be laughing at his jokes
I be fucking on these hoes
I spent everything I have
Just to make it right back
A nigga never gon' be sad
Cause I ran my sac up

[Chorus]
Ran my sac up
Just ran my sac up

[Verse 2]
I'm making my way, I'm making my
Making my way, I'm making my
I don't even got no time
To waste money on these dimes
I'm making my way, I'm making my
Making my way, I'm making my
These niggas broke, they can't hang around me
They can't hang around me, unless they run they sac up

[Chorus]
Run my sac up
Run my sac up

[Part 2: Running]

[Verse]
We keep on running it up
We keep on running it up
We keep on, keep, keep
In this game, I'm running yeah
These niggas keep running from us
We keep on thumbing yeah
Cause we keep on running it up
We keep on running it up
I can't even stress it enough
My pockets just ain't fat enough
They say Lil Boat you changed
They say Lil Boat don't forget about your fam
When you get to the fame I need me 'bout 3 rings
Cause I'm just not flexing enough
And these niggas they not hating enough
But trust and believe
I'm on my gang I'm not sleep
I'mma take care of my brothers, make sure they eat
Niggas act like they don't see when you rise above them
We gon' be alright
Done running it up
