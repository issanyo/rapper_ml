[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Today's a good day, today is a day I'ma go and get richer
Codeine demon leavin' yo' bitch with semen, she takin' my picture
When I come around, these niggas get punked, I'm Ashton Kutcher
Smokin' Swishas, drinkin' lean from the pitcher, my life couldn't get better
I got the bag, I put the hoes in the back of the Jag'
I got the lean in the cup, I got the clips in the mag, I got the mag in the MAC
I bought my mama the Rover, chinchilla sittin' in the shoulder, yeah, you know that it's over
Wrap it up and ship it over
Turn up bitch, whoo!

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag
I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag
I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag
I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag
I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag
I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag
I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag
I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag
I got the bag, I got the, I got the bag

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
My bitch, she bad, she poppin' some tags, her ass hella fat, and she couting stacks
Yacht Club my gang, Skeem Team my gang, these hoes got my name, bitch it's Roger Dane
How the hell you goin' to fuck with me asking for this but you ain't got that? (Ain't got that!)
Chop my whole brick from a half to a quarter, that bitch move like four flats
White bitch, she cook the smack, give me a million dollars, she goin' to come back
She goin' to bring it back, she goin' to bring it back, she goin' to bring it back
I'm all about my dollars, you attention seeker, you want Twitter followers (Lame nigga)
We Goyard, bag, gettin' 'em, bag
Still keep my stash, still throwin' cash, double a bag
I remember when he sold the gas like a math
I'm not no Migo but I beat the pussy like punching bag
Put cash in the bag, zips in the bag, lean in the bag
I keep the case in case a nigga want his skull cracked
My nigga Ashton told me to tell ya'll niggas he want his swag back
They be workin' out the paper bag or the book bag
Whatever you do, wherever you go, just remember I got the bag

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag
I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag
I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag
I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag
I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag
I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag
I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag
I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag, I got the bag
I got the bag, I got the, I got the bag

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Who got the bag? You got the bag!
Bag? Whoo! Who got the bag?
What? Yeah! Swag! Who got the bag?
What? Yeah! Yuh! What?
