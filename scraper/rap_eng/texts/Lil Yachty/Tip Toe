[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Gang, gang on everything
I need that Johnny fucking Dang
From every ring and every chain
I think I need a new whip
I want the finest wood grain
I had to skip that bitch a grade
She gave RD the best brain
Then polished all my new chains
I think I need my wrist watch on bling blang
Earrings on ching chang
College ain't for Yachty but I'm going for my mama's sake
I'ma hit that ho 1Night then you gon' take her on a date
You gonna make sure that she straight
And I make sure my future great
Niggas talking heavy but they easy, bust like stemless grapes
2015, I'ma be eighteen, buying my own estates
2016 RD gonna be fucking hoes down by the lake
Wait did that in 2012
Damn RD you living well
Bitches ain't on me begging, but now I'm on my name ring bells
Linking shit like Zelda, so boy respect your elders
I might be younger physically, but mentally I'm older
And visually I'm colder
And psychologically bolder

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I'm back again with backwoods
Hoe roll 'em up
Where were you from throw it up
Cuz all my niggas down to buck
SKT my fucking gang
NAZ my fucking gang
YC that's my fucking gang
'Cause Byou let them pistols bang
Peter Piper picked a pepper
RD ran right through your ranch cuz you ain't real
Niggas drink a little purple and swear to god they so damn trill
Dirty south Titanium grill
Show your bitch who really real
Looking so damn rich you would of thought a nigga hit a heist
Dabbing with all of this white
Looking like a bowl of rice
Flexing hard I'm Jerry Rice, I'm MVP on every night
If I get on I'm living right
Sip dirty Sprite like every night
RIP to A$AP Yams
Money like a bank scam
Counting all my money on a yacht with my bitch Tam
And she came from Alabama, new whip paint on Tropicana
Make it seem like opera
I'm shooting shit like GRA GRA
In love with the big tatas
Su casa, Mi casa
Run in your shit and then take it
Stacking chips like Vegas
