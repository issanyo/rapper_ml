[Intro: Skippa Da Flippa]
Na for real
Na I'm just sayin we could just what we do though
Hahahaha I'm a tell ya
Flippa!

[Hook: Skippa Da Flippa]
She say she want me not the crew (she sexy)
I think she love how a nigga move (swear)
Usually I catch 'em in twos
But tonight it's gon' be me and you (just us)
I told her "you gotta play by my rules" (huh?)
When we leave here, I'll just follow you (what else?)
She like my dab cause they drip the juice (dab)
I sip my cup and she down the goose

[Bridge: Skippa Da Flippa]
Get loose, get loose
Get loose, get loose
I swear a ton I drink till I'm done and you know that we party for fun
Get loose, get loose
Get loose, get loose
Got faded off Hennessy, hotel in Beverly therefore I know she'll remember me (Flippa!)

[Verse 1: Skippa Da Flippa]
You know I know you ain't lonely (huh?)
Get drunk and only fuck for one night only (nasty)
Ten rounds of Hen and the tops always on me (cap)
My name is Flippa you should get to know me (what else?)
You came to get loose and I came to pipe up
It's a pint in my pocket, but Hen in my cup (drank)
You have to be real to party with us (piped up)
You have to be havin to party with us (swear)
We met at a function and had a discussion (met at a...)
She had a boyfriend, but it ain't mean nothing (it ain't mean...)
Smokin and drinkin and poppin and touchin (smokin and...)
I fucked her long time, the Percocets workin (we sport?)
The zipper she opened right after there Flipper (took it)
First came the whisper, then she touched my zipper (first came the...)
I don't drink at all, but tonight it's the liquor (damn)
This for the bad bitches, this for the strippers (Flippa!)

[Hook: Skippa Da Flippa]
She say she want me not the crew (she sexy)
I think she love how a nigga move (swear)
Usually I catch 'em in twos
But tonight it's gon' be me and you (she stuss)
I told her "you gotta play by my rules" (huh?)
When we leave here, I'll just follow you (what else?)
She like my dab cause they drip the juice (dab)
I sip my cup and she down the goose

[Bridge: Skippa Da Flippa]
Get loose, get loose
Get loose, get loose
I swear a ton I drink till I'm done and you know that we party for fun
Get loose, get loose
Get loose, get loose
Got faded off Hennessy, hotel in Beverly therefore I know she'll remember me

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Yeah, all of these bitches they want me
But trust me baby girl, I only want you (huh?)
She asked me do I usually do this?
No baby girl, you are one of the few (awh)
Top floor condo with a view
You can do want you want, you can move how you move (awh damn)
Give you hot dick for the night
But no pictures, no Snapchat, I can't have no trace
Ridin that D made it feel like a race
One-fifty, my dash gotta get to the safe
Skippa n' Lil Boat, we got hoes by the mixture
Pro low my sinker, upgraded my fixture
Broke actin cars so he got him a Fisker
Big bro locked up for that pot, now he miss her
Four Seasons twice with my new bitch
Thirty-thousand, spent that shit on my wrist (woah)

[Hook: Skippa Da Flippa]
She say she want me not the crew (she sexy)
I think she love how a nigga move (swear)
Usually I catch 'em in twos
But tonight it's gon' be me and you (she stuss)

[Outro: Skippa Da Flippa]
Get loose, get loose
Get loose, get loose
I swear a ton I drink till I'm done and you know that we party for fun
Get loose, get loose
Get loose, get loose
Got faded off Hennessy, hotel in Beverly therefore I know she'll remember me
