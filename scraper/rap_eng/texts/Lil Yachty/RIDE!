[Chorus: JBan$]
Chopper sing like a choir
Bullets raining on your idols
Niggas tryna fight for their survival
Know I had to like Michael
Niggas really tryna ride my wave
Niggas really tryna ride the wave
Niggas really tryna ride my wave
Niggas really tryna ride the wave

[Verse 1: JBan$]
I don't smoke no dope, I just pour the four (off the goop)
Got me movin' slow, moonwalk like the goat
Tryna ride the wave can barely float
You gon' sink the boat
Better row, better row your boat, better row your boat, hey
Ooh, I just fell in love with the money, hey
Wrap them bricks tight like a mummy
I got three phones, bitches tryna bone
Got it off the scale, I got rich of sales
Bought my Jesus piece, scream hallelujah, ayy
I just poured a six in my cooler
Bitch, I'm flooded with my jeweler
(why you drivin' so fast?) 'Cause my drive got super dooly yeah
Ayy, two cup styrofoam, let's pour up, ayy
Diamond shine when I'm like, bitch hold up
Ayy lil nigga where you from, you better throw it up
Ayy, you a bitch you put it out, then froze up
Ayy they shootin' in the sky, yeah they shooting blanks
They like thirty [?], they tryna make me wait
Ayy, diamonds water wet swimming in the tank
Go hard in the paint, point that chopper at your face

[Chorus: JBan$]
Chopper sing like a choir
Bullets raining on your idols
Niggas tryna fight for their survival
Know I had to like Michael
Niggas really tryna ride my wave
Niggas really tryna ride the wave
Niggas really tryna ride my wave
Niggas really tryna ride the wave

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Niggas need to give me my credit
Like a scammer who don't know the four digit pin for debit
Used to ride in a Chevy, with a truck had a levy
Here to pick up your car, and take it to the junkies
Ball like Kareem Jabbar, go apeshit, no monkey
And my gang do not spar, we dump shit like dump trucks
Niggas can't stand us, one call they send us
Louis V sandals, wood grain on handles
Peg bars, mongoose
Niggas tryna fight for they survival
Yachty posters in your room like a bible (goddamn)
Posted with the main bitch of my rival (that's for real)
I'm a motherfuckin' worldwide idol

[Chorus: JBan$]
Chopper sing like a choir
Bullets raining on your idols
Niggas tryna fight for their survival
Know I had to like Michael
Niggas really tryna ride my wave
Niggas really tryna ride the wave
Niggas really tryna ride my wave
Niggas really tryna ride the wave
