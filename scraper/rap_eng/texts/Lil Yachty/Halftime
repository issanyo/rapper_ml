[Chorus: Skippa Da Flippa]
Thin mint cookie, roll a whole halftime
Hit him with the chopper, breathing last time, flatline
Beat the block down when I turn up the alpine
Smoke a three-five, sell a halftime at halftime
It's halftime, halftime
Keep a lil steel by my belt line
FN leave you with an outline
And you'll only see me at halftime

[Verse 1: Skippa Da Flippa]
Cop a QP, he shorted a halftime
18K grill so my mouth is a gold mine
Bad bitch in Bama, she cheer for the Roll Tide
Hit 'em with the sack like I did to him last time
You fumble, let's rumble
Skippa Flippa from the jungle
Catch the pussy, Alge Crumpler
Dank it come wrapped up in bundles
Eighty yard run, touchdown
Carry the pack you get run down
QB see the pack, get gunned down
We too geeked, we walk around like it's ghost town
I'm no amateur, fly to Canada
Tuck [?] motion fly the camera
Fuck her face like I offended her
I smoke presidential so I run for senator, Flippa

[Chorus: Skippa Da Flippa]
Thin mint cookie, roll a whole halftime
Hit him with the chopper, breathing last time, flatline
Beat the block down when I turn up the alpine
Smoke a three-five, sell a halftime at halftime
It's halftime, halftime
Keep a lil steel by my belt line
FN leave you with an outline
And you'll only see me at halftime

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Halftime, Deon Sanders
All my big homies keep the hammer
I'm never going broke, no MC Hammer
She suckin' dick just to take a picture on the camera
Run it up like LT, all these pussy niggas wanna be
They wanna be like Lil Boat and Skip
They call him Flip 'cause he water whip
I'm balls deep all in your bitch like a Hail Mary
She mad at me 'cause I popped her cherry
Gold teeth like I'm Ocho Cinco
Copped a new Benz, came from Puerto Rico
And her big brother named Chico
Used to give them packs to my brother Nino
For the L-O, they used to post up at the corner store
If he fuck with my money, punch him in the throat
Raggedy broke nigga, Joe Blow
I'm fresh as hell, yeah from head to toe
Young nigga, I might pick and roll
Young nigga ball like finger roll
I'm a nasty nigga, make her touch her toes
And I dab when I touch down
And my bitch she just touched down
Get a hotel when I'm in town
'Cause I don't trust her

[Chorus: Skippa Da Flippa]
Thin mint cookie, roll a whole halftime
Hit him with the chopper, breathing last time, flatline
Beat the block down when I turn up the alpine
Smoke a three-five, sell a halftime at halftime
It's halftime, halftime
Keep a lil steel by my belt line
FN leave you with an outline
And you'll only see me at halftime
