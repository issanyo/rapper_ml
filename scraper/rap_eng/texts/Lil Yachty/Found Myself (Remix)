[Intro: FatBoy SSE]
I think that I found myself
Yeah, I think I found myself
Huh, Pat turn me up

[Chorus: FatBoy SSE & Lil Yachty]
I think that I found myself
I didn't do this shit by myself
I did it with some real ones who helped
Now we gettin' rich, we eatin' well
I think that I found myself

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Ayy, ooh, I think I done found my next bitch (Woo)
Hundred thousand dollars, print that on my left wrist (Bling)
Thirty thousand on my pinky finger, I'm the shit (Woo)
I spend all this money 'cause I used to ain't have shit (Tell 'em)
Ayy, can't fuck with niggas, we ain't got the same goals
Got a new bitch, she the same color mango
Ass super fat, you can see from all angles, uh
Ha (Woo, yeah)
Used to be broke, ridin' in the Durango (yeah)
Now I got so many whips like I'm Django
One color blue, and the other be blanco, yeah
My bitch a stallion, my bitch a bronco
My bitch be brown like a leaf, yeah, Fronto
Moved out my mama crib
Bought mom a crib, then I bought me a condo, yeah (Hoo)
These niggas don't understand me
But that's okay 'cause I understand myself, whoa

[Chorus: FatBoy SSE & Lil Yachty]
I think that I found myself (Gang gang, Lil Boat)

Now we gettin' rich, we eatin' well (We eatin' well)
I think that I found myself (Self)
I think that I found myself (Myself)
I think that I found myself (Oh, Lil Boat)

[Verse 2: FatBoy SSE]
Hey, I think that I found my niche
Now I'm gettin' money on these niggas like I'm Mitch

And I don't care what you say, nigga, I'm the shit
Ayy, look, you can't stop me

When the come in the lobby, they givin' toppy

Huh, and he gon' let it go

[Chorus: FatBoy SSE & Lil Yachty]

[Verse 3: Fuzzy Fazu]
(Fuzzy, Fuzzy, Fat, I got you)
I'm stuck up, I only roll exotic broccoli
Think I'm fancy now, I'm too good for a Masi (I ain't drivin' that)
But all that hatin'll turn you into a homi'
Sittin' on your ass, you ain't got no job, Tommy (You ain't got no job)
I need a billi', no really, that's on my mommy (That's on my mama)
Until they free the wave, Fuzzy the tsunami (Ow)
Go to Torpedo Base, I need cheese and pastrami (I need that shit)
After I eat, she know to get me toppy, sloppy (That toppy, sloppy)
I'm focused on my health (My health)
I'm headed into wealth, grandma, I believe in myself (Myself)
FatBoy Gang the shit, man, we too lit for any show
FatBoy Gang the shit, man, we too lit for any show
Yeah (Fuzzy, Fuzzy)

[Chorus: FatBoy SSE & Lil Yachty]

Now we gettin' rich, we eatin' well (We eatin' well)
I think that I found myself (Self)
I think that I found myself (Myself)
I think that I found myself (Oh, Lil Boat)
