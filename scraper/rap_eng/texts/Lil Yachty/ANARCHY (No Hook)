[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Stay with the map like apple
Talking that shit, have them come in your chapel
Young nigga fly, I can fly pterodactyl
Got a new bitch with a son, he a rascal
I get the bag from the city, the capital
These niggas fake and Lil Boat be the actual
Beefing online but in person you rational
I do not get it
Making this money, it's making them livid
The shit that you rap bout, you know you don't live it
I got the coupe with the top, you can lift it
I got the coupe with the engine, go drift it
Diamonds they wet like a cup of the mystic
Living this life, so futuristic
Stay optimistic

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Off the top of the dome
I'm a big boss, Al Capone
Rocking [?] like my name was Jerome
You want the smoke, told the boy to come on
All of the gang members, what's up and I'm on
Fuck with the set, look at my phone
I do not club, that's not what I do
I stay at home and sleep in the stu'
Plotting on ways to build up revenue
Catch me outside on the old avenue
Been a star player, check the attributes
Ben 'bout the guap since I had sessions too
Know they want the boy hung by a noose
Won't catch me lacking, I stay with the truth
Shoot night roofs, and a light handed loops
Shoot, shoot, shoot

[Instrumental]
