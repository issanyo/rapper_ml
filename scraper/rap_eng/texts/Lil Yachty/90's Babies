[Verse 1: JBan$]
My bitch pussy bald, no alopecia
Diamonds say hello, it's nice to meet ya
My big brother said keep his heater
Bitch, and he won't hesitate to heat ya
Baby I can't dance but my diamonds tango
Flip your bitch on her stomach like I'm Kurt Angle
I hit from every side, attacking all angles
I fuck her stomach up like she ate some bad food
Bitch, money longer than the water hose
Bust down AP, this a one of two
No college but make more than your mama do
Got fronted a big sack and tried to down a two

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Road rage
Platinum look like steel cages
Nigga we the new ages
Nigga we the nineties babies
Nigga we got road rage
Platinum look like steel cages
Nigga we the new ages
Nigga we the nineties babies
Nigga we got road rage

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Bitch it's Big Blue Bill Boat
King of Teens by vote
Dick deep in her throat
Cause her daddy think Boat a joke
No this shit not a game
Sixty-five for my chain
Had an upgrade in my name
And whip double dish, a remix
Well known anemics, rich nigga semen
All up on her face, watch her wash it off
She might try to keep it
Keep it as a secret, I ain't really going
Niggas really hoeing
Cause I'm getting money, niggas hatin' Boat
I'm the youth Pope
With diamonds on my throat

[Verse 3: JBan$]
Born in the nineties
Flooded out timepiece
Your diamonds lookin' cloudy, old niggas hatin'
Their daughter want to date me
Lil bitch wanna crowd me
For a Grammy, sixty for a Plan B
I ain't have no plan B, this my only option
Pass her like an option, sell her like an auction

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Road rage
Platinum look like steel cages
Nigga we the new ages
Nigga we the nineties babies
Nigga we got road rage
Platinum look like steel cages
Nigga we the new ages
Nigga we the nineties babies
Nigga we got road rage
