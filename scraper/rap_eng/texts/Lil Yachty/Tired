[Transcribing]

[Hook]
I'm mother fucking tired
I'm mother fucking tired
I'm mother fucking tired
I'm mother fucking tired
I'm tired, I'm tired
I'm mother fucking tired
I'm mother fucking tired
I'm mother fucking tired
I'm mother fucking tired

[Verse 1]
Aight, aight
Check me out, pony tags hit me and they tired struck me out
The fucking tags hit me and they tryna take me out
I love ten thousand that like my grandma house
I'm walking with the work I had to work it, work it out
Goo by the plug, the boot bout to jump at it
Like hoes can't say I take over the whole sack
Lil yatchy say take your hoes on a boat ride
Dogs out AK, sit lil boat side
Big dog Gleeshy, and he riding low ride
