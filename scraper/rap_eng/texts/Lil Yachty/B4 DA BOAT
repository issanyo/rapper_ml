[Part: 1]

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]

I talk to the 6 when I chill in the 6
I got hella' bricks hella' bands
Counting through money so fast
I should breeze like a ceiling fan
I never needed a middle man
I been the plug to the socket
My white bitch, she love to play crocket
She cook the dope up
Hiding the sack in her pocket
I been re sighting the path for the rocket

[Hook: Jban$]
White hoes playing
White hoes playing
White hoes playing
Why you hoes playing croquet?

[Part: 2]

[Verse: Lil Yachty]
Off top, niggas know that I'm the shit
Gotta' iced out wrist that could fuck your baddest bitch
Stacking up doe, switching up swerving on foes
Hard top when the rain drop
Candy apple red Ferrari paint
Make these bitches faint
When I walk past to serve their daddy dank
Make them walk the plank on my new Yacht
Motha' fucka' stupid hoe that's a bitch there
I got all of they attention while my wrist glare
Talk slicker, my stack thicker, my dick bigger
What other else reasons do you want baby?
Tell me it would be stupid if you didn't hop in this Mercedes
Hella bitches on my line, got my main crazy
Hella' lean in my cup, got my eyes lazy
I've really been on the scene with my niggas baby
Tryina' flip it like it's crack in the late 80's
Got my bitch getting wetter like a vet navy
I've been putting hella' miles on that Bim lately
I've been stunting hella' hard with my team lately
I've been strictly on some counting cash tims lately
Stackin' up for that championship ring baby
