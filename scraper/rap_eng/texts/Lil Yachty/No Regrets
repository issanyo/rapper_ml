Blow a check, diamonds chokin' on my neck (neck)
Tell the plug that I got everything on deck (nah)

Sorry, I don't do Ferrari's

All the paper chasers fuck with me the long way (way)
Throwin' up dollar signs 'cause everything the hard way
Bueno, bueno
You can smell it sh- cookin' in the hallway
Did it my way, never did it y'all way

Rolex (Rolex), sex appeal
