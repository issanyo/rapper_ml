[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Yeah! Lil Boat
KYLE, and Lil Boat

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Hey Julie, heard you got that wet, wet, wet
Something for my neck, neck, neck
Hey Julie, heard you got that drip, got that drip
Something for my wrist, for my wrist
Hey Julie
Ooh, hey Julie

[Verse 1: KYLE]
(I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it)
Yeah, hey Julie, heard you got that drip, drip, drip, drip
Yeah, something for my wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Paparazzi sound like flick, flick, flick, flick (Flick flick, flick flick)
Nikon, I'm an Icon like Will Smith kid, yeah
Me and Yachty, that’s a layup
My old life, hasta luego
Whoa, I told Spanish mami, vete aqui, whoa
Yeah, gold in my mouth, I don't talk cheap (No)
Yeah, these bitches used to make fun of my teeth (Woo)
Now they crusty, AC busted, house 100 degrees, ha
Yo, that's fucked up but oh well, she’s an asshole
Told her no sweat, she can chill in my castle
This shit was so fire, Yachty had to run it back though
'Bout to write a chain off on my tax though

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Hey Julie, heard you got that wet, wet, wet
Something for my neck, neck, neck
Hey Julie, heard you got that drip, got that drip
Something for my wrist, for my wrist
Hey Julie
Ooh, hey Julie
Hey Julie
Ooh, hey Julie

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I got it, I got it, I got it
Hey Julie, how I act a fool with the jewelry
Ayy, I can read your mind like a story
Julie, why you gotta lie, gotta lie? (Don't lie)
Your little brother think I am so fly
Hey Julie (Yeah), I used to rap about the toolie, that's old me (Yeah)
Now I gotta go and see my jeweler, an oldie (Yeah)
Playin' Sega Genesis like now I put in OT
Ayy (Wait), do you get it, OT Genasis (Yeah)
All these happy raps, SuperDuperBoat invented this (Yeah)
Ayy, I know that you hate this (Yeah)
I'm fuckin' on your mistress (Yeah)
Eat her like a biscuit (Yeah)
Tick, tick, tick, but my rollie don't tock
Young smart black nigga, finna buy some stock

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Hey Julie, heard you got that wet, wet, wet
Something for my neck, neck, neck
Hey Julie, heard you got that drip, got that drip
Something for my wrist, for my wrist
Hey Julie
Ooh, hey Julie
Hey Julie
Ooh, hey Julie
