[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Brought down that work with my bitch when I drive her she ride it
I go home and beat it soo violent
Count up that connor while she ride my water
It's been all long that she keep me in order
Something like sorta
My diamonds with me when I just had quarters
That's why when I get richer I'mma paint the picture
Make sure that she look tough smokin' out the swisher like... (yea)
Yea, cause my lil lady deserve it, she know I heard it
She know that I was just hurtin', now I'm up livin' like...
