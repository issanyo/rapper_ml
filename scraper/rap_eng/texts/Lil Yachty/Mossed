[Chorus: Wintertime Zi)
Don't get mossed nigga (x4)
Made a play on his head don't get mossed nigga
Caught the play on his head don't get mossed nigga
I just want my neck on chill, want my neck on frost, nigga
I gotta floss, nigga, I canâ€™t take no loss, nigga

[Verse 1: Wintertime Zi)
Randy with the Vikings , my new bitch so excited

Young yola fire , young street fighter
Aye you niggas expired , I'm working like I'm higher
I need that play I do not need me a bitch because bitches be playing you need a beat you niggas is paying
Winter go dumb I go super Saiyan
