[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Like you on some homie shit
Don't lie to me, baby, you know you want me there
I take it out your mouth and you can blow me kiss
When I ain't have nothin', baby, you showed me shit

I done fell in love, I done fell in love
I done fell in love with my homie bitch
I done fell in love, I done fell in love
