[Hook: Lotto Savage]
Thirty, thirty, thirty, thirty
Thirty, thirty, thirty, thirty
Glock fifteen hold thirty
Glock twenty-three hold thirty
Shoot at you and your lil buddy
All of my trips they dirty
Thirty, thirty, thirty, thirty
Thirty, thirty, thirty, thirty
Glock fifteen hold thirty
Glock twenty-three hold thirty
Shoot at you and your lil buddy
All of my trips they dirty

[Verse 1: Lotto Savage]
All of my trips they dirty
All of my bloods, they bloody
All of my niggas be stuntin'
All of my niggas get money
All of my niggas count hundreds
Thirty on a thirty mean I'm walking on the brick
Forty with a thirty, lemon squeeze, bust your shit
Miss me with the flexing and the [?] whip
Nigga flexing like a trapper, you ain't never sold a brick
This set get shot with the bankroll on
RIP trick, yeah long live Bankroll
Spent two or three days in the same clothes
Chasin' after bankrolls, turn up on a stank ho
Keep two guns strapped like a soldier
Working out the NOLA, I move boulders
I whip cola, I whip yola
Working like a sodier, popping like a soldier

Thirty, thirty, thirty, thirty

All of my trips they dirty
Thirty, thirty, thirty, thirty
Thirty, thirty, thirty, thirty
Glock fifteen hold thirty
Glock twenty-three hold thirty
Shoot at you and your lil buddy
All of my trips they dirty

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Thirty, niggas, 'round me, shootin'
That mean I don't tuck my chain
Don't you talk down on my name
Lotto, he keep him a thirty
Shoutout Lil Sid cause he keep his cup dirty
These internet gangsters, they talk but won't hurt me
These flexing ass niggas Rolex ain't cost thirty
Fake watch wearing nigga
No guap getting nigga
Fairy tale living nigga
On Instagram taking pictures
I can tell you not the shooter
Ain't no bullets in that Ruger
Pussy nigga thought shit was sweet
'til we brought the heat and left him on his knees
Lil Boat
