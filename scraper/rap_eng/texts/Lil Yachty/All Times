Keep that chopper with me all times these niggas be snakes
I swear I can't trust a soul, I cannot trust one
Keep that chopper with me all times these niggas be snakes
I swear I can't trust a soul, I cannot trust one
Keep that chopper with me all times these niggas be snakes
I swear I can't trust a soul, I cannot trust one

I remember I had no cash, I had no fame
Now them hoes all wanna fuck with that boy Rocky Dane
Now these niggas wanna steal my songs, bitch stay in yo lane

Keep that chopper with me all times these niggas be snakes
I swear I can't trust a soul, I cannot trust one
Keep that chopper with me all times these niggas be snakes
I swear I can't trust a soul, I cannot trust one
