[Intro: Famous Dex & Lil Yachty]
Wooh

Wooh, wooh, woohoo
I just bought me a Ferrari, skrt, skrt

[Hook: Famous Dex]
I just bought me a Ferrari
I just pull up in a Rari
Fucked a little bitch in a Rari
My diamonds they blind you, I'm sorry
Ferrari, Ferrari
I just bought me a Ferrari
I just pull up in a Rari
My diamonds they blind you, I'm sorry
Ferrari, Ferrari
I just bought me a Ferrari
I just pull up in a Rari
My diamonds they blind you, I'm sorry
Ferrari, Ferrari
I just bought me a Ferrari
I just pull up in a Rari
My diamonds they blind you, I'm sorry

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I just got me a Ferrari
Black with the wood-grain like Atari
I don't eat no calamari
Always on my VLONE like I'm Bari
Ride around through the safari
With Dex tryna catch us a body
(You know... fuck on bad bitches, you know
Big booty bitches, that's how we do)
I'm the one they want at the party
All these other rapping niggas sorry
One fifty, skrting on the E-way
Tired of giving these niggas leeway
Ain't a nigga that gon' check Boat, nah, not never
Twenty-five hundred for my sweater
Got these bitches thinking I'm clever
How you doing?

Fucked a little bitch in a Rari
My diamonds they blind you, I'm sorry

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
I just pull up in a Rari
I'm sippin' on lean not Bacardi
These bitches they text me "I'm sorry"
Baby girl, you retarded
My diamonds they blind you, I'm sorry
I'm busting off, I'm flexing on the mollies
These bitches they geek in the lobby
I'm thinking they wanna have a party
I got nothing but ink on my body
Bitch I be balling like Bobby
My thirty, it shoot like Scottie
Taking off like a rocket
Nothing but bands in my pocket
I'm smoking dope, who gon' stop me?
All these bitches saying sorry
I just bought me a Rari

[Hook: Famous Dex]

Fucked a little bitch in a Rari
My diamonds they blind you, I'm sorry

[Verse 3: Ugly God]
I'm Ugly God, my dick little
My necks musty but I'm fucking bitches
I'm in poverty, my J's fake
But all these hoes still fucking with me
I'm disrespectful, I'ma steal your girl
Just to grab her ass and then rub her titties
I'm an ugly nigga, I know this shit
But my dick game still bubblelicious
Ugly God squeeze on your bitch in the closet
Ugly God got your bitch wet like a droplet
Ugly God make your bitch drip like a faucet
Ugly God melt your bitch heart like some chocolate

[Hook: Famous Dex]
