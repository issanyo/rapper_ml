[Hook: Lil Yachty]
I stroll through cities, gang they stay with me
But never have I seen someone so pretty like you
Every dream I seem to have is always 'bout you
Oh...

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Beautiful soul with good energy, I kept it real with you
Never pretended to be anything that I was not
I just want you at my spot, I just want you with me now
Where are you now? Tell me what town
Fly you up out of your city, just so that I can look at you
And tell you you pretty, you know
So many thoughts that I have
Just wanna take you and show yo ass off to my city
You lookin' so pretty, you act so sadity
I love when you with me, you shittin' on bitches
Oh, you shittin' on bitches, and when we together
We shittin' on every Mr. and Mrs
Ain't no bitch nowhere that could replace your kisses
You put Lil Boat in his zone, I'll never leave you alone
Pack up your bags and come to my city
I'll move you right into my home
And I fuck with you cause baby girl
You is never running through my phone

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
I stroll through cities, gang they stay with me
But never have I seen someone so pretty like you (like you)
Every dream I seem to have is always 'bout you
Oh...

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I know you done been through a lot
But trust me when I say that I’m there for you
I know you done been through the pain and the struggle
So baby just let me take care of you
We can go fly off to Paris
We could double date with Perry
We can make love on a ferry
Buy you the shoes where the heels red like cherries
And when you havin a bad day
I hold you tight, straight through the night
Cheer you up when you be down, we can go run up the town
I work so hard, just so that we can flex on 'em
Like look at me now
Tried to shit on me back then
That was back then, I remember when
Fuck 'em we ball it's just me and you
Never need nobody, pull off in big body
Queen of my life girl I see you, girl I promise that I need you

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
I stroll through cities, gang they stay with me
But never have I seen someone so pretty like you
Every dream I seem to have is always 'bout you
Oh...

[Verse 3: Burberry Perry]
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Let me take care of you
We should make, one and one equal two
Woah woah woah, never been a fan of goodbye
Rather put two and two together like x and y
Want you there every morning to tie my ties
'Cause being with you is like being on a wild roller coaster ride
How many nights can I go without seeing your pretty face
We could do it anywhere, you pick the time and the place
You’re my little freak, I always want you in my space
Every moment I spend with you, there's nothing I'd erase

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
I stroll through cities, gang they stay with me
But never have I seen someone so pretty like you
Every dream I seem to have is always 'bout you
Ohh

[Outro:: Lil Yachty]
Don't you fall on me, baby girl
Stand tall for me, baby girl
Don't you evolve on me, baby girl
Oh, oh
Please don't you fall on me, baby girl
Please stand tall for me, baby girl
Don't you evolve on me, baby girl
Oh, oh, oh
You mean it all to me, baby girl
Don't you fall on me, baby girl
Stand tall for me, baby girl
Oh, oh, oh
You don't do nothing
Don't you evolve...
