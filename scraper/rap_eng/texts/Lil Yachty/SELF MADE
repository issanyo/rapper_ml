[Intro]
Ch-Ch-Charlie Shuffler

[Chorus]
Made it out my momma crib, then bought my moms a crib (uh)
Bought myself a chain, kept it short 'cause I ain't Jibbs (uh)
She gon' let me fuck, she like that "Lil Boat" adlib (Lil Boat!)
And we at Liv (uh), later I'm in her ribs (uh)
I know she your bitch but I'm up first 'cause I called dibs (uh)
Niggas hate on me because I live the way I do (yah)
Hatin' on a nigga ain't gon' make a better you
Self-made nigga with a self-made crew (gang)

[Verse]
Took my bitch from D.R. to Peru (uh)
And I'll take my gang from the county to the moon (uh)
I promise I be ballin' 'till it's 2080 in June (yah)
I'ma keep rocking these chains while they keep callin' me "coon" (uh)
And she ride dick like a broom (uh)
And I drop tops like it's June' (yah)
And you keep askin' "When we gon' do a song?"
I'ma keep tellin' you "Soon" (yah)
Big rocks on my wrist, might see a fish dog, it's real water (Lil Boat!)
Niggas better hide they daughter (uh)
Real raptor, Vince Carter (yah)

[Chorus]
Made it out my momma crib, then bought my moms a crib (uh)
Bought myself a chain, kept it short 'cause I ain't Jibbs (uh)
She gon' let me fuck, she like that "Lil Boat" adlib (Lil Boat!)
And we at Liv (uh), later I'm in her ribs (uh)
I know she your bitch but I'm up first 'cause I called dibs (uh)
Niggas hate on me because I live the way I do (yah)
Hatin' on a nigga ain't gon' make a better you
Self-made nigga with a self-made crew (gang)
