Brother locked up for the bricks
I grew up ‘round a sheltered family, I ain’t have to do that shit
But I still pop a nigga like a Twix, ay
Still crack a nigga like a Twix
I said brother locked up for the bricks
I grew up ‘round a sheltered family, I ain’t have to do that shit
But I still crack a nigga like a Twix, ay
Ay, hold on, yeah, ok, hold on

My new bitch named Sally
She come over and she whip the pot
Then she turn over and bend it over
Young nigga know it’s over
Every other rapper in the game best believe that it’s game over

By the time I get the money

Never ever will a nigga live alone
