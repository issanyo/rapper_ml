Verse 1: [Pollàri]
If you need it, I get it, I go, hey
I don't want her, I want you, hey
She stalking, she loving the crew, hey
She running, she come and pull up, hey
I got them racks like a Jew, hey
I need that money times two, hey
Forever she wanting to love me
Forever she wanting to love me

Verse 2: [Lil Yachty]
More to life [?]
Fuck that lil bitch 'till she pays her time
Raising my head all my braids are fly
She stripping she started [?]
She tripping she should have [?]
I need my bread like a sum
Tryna take off with her
Precipitated on you dubs
My bitch got off with the juugs
I got that work from the plug
I might drop bands on a rug
Just to show niggas I'm up
