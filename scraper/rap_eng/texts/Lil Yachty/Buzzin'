[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
They know I'ma ride with you
Pull up on the avenue in something hardly average
Hope I got no problems with you
Cause I know to bag mine like Ralphs at the fast line
Seventy for a verse, bought a purse and a feature
Shawty said she love my long hair, look like Jesus
I blow through the hundred pack with you baby

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Lil Yachty]
I still run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
You never stuntin' 'til you met a nigga like me
Don't you disagree, I gave you everything you need

[Post-Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I run through a hundred pack with you baby, baby, oh
Keep it nine, keep it ninety nine degrees, keep it a hundred
I don't want a cheap bitch whinin' 'til she hit a hundred
We get bitches by the dozen, we get bitches by the dozen
That's my breezy, breezy, breezy, that's my buzzin'
Threw the racks for the chains and the watch came flooded

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Lil Yachty]
I still run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
You never stuntin' 'til you met a nigga like me
Don't you disagree, I gave you everything you need
I run through a hundred pack with you baby, baby

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I made you look better than you was
Run up a stack thicker than some Bloods
Took you straight out the hood, took you out the mud
Just because
You a young hustler, I love how you get it
Go get it, you'll watch how I flip it
You see how I did it, but that's history
You get a million dollar kiss from me
You a diamond, every other bad bitch in this world is more just like a six to me
So come and be rich with me, ride on a Six with me
I run through a hundred pack with you just to let you know that I'm with you

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Lil Yachty]
I still run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
You never stuntin' 'til you met a nigga like me
Don't you disagree, I gave you everything you need
I run through a hundred pack with you baby, baby

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Lil Yachty]
Keep it nine, keep it ninety nine degrees, keep it a hundred
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
You never stuntin' 'til you met a nigga like me
Don't you disagree, I gave you everything you need
