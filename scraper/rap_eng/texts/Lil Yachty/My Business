[Intro]
It's Lil Boat
Yeah, yeah
Aye

[Verse 1]
I've done lost respect for a lot of people (I did)
I've done lost friends I done made ends
And stuff 'bout loyalty's just a word to a lot of people (f'real)
It's not an action, these nigga's be actin'
Now I got to where I'm goin' without a lot of people (f'real)
So I hate when a nigga try to act like he made you
Nah you ain't make me, no (no)
Walk around gun 'em got a safety note (no)
Line it back in it's eight feet long (f'real)
And they hate these songs but they listen anyway (they do)
And now they think that nigga gay
'Cause they kissin' on the cover

[Chorus]
Nigga worry 'bout yo business (business)
Nigga worry 'bout your digits
Shit used to be so easy when I rode in a Civic
Now all these people in my business
Everybody in my business, why these people in my business?
And these people in my Bentleys
And they flip just like switches
So I can't trust a soul
No I can't no, no
No I can't no, no, no (gang)

[Verse 2]
Never will I trust no bitches (no)
Only bad things happen
Going out sad happens when you go and trust no bitches (yuh)
Fuck that shit man I'm finna flex on 'em (gang)
I just made a four and a fifty though (f'real)
Got a bad yellow bitch in my video (oh)
Got her all in my hall like Arsenio (okay)
I might be the flyest thing since this millennium (oh)
I don't understand why the hate (no)
I think the world understand that I'm great (yah)
Leave a Nutter Butter on that little bitch face (aye)
And I love when she eat it, yeah I love when she taste (ew)
All in her face (pew)
I'm like "hahaha", all in yo face
I'm in all of y'all face
Cause you didn't ever think but

[Chorus]
Nigga worry 'bout yo business (business)
Nigga worry 'bout your digits
Shit used to be so easy when I rode in a Civic
Now all these people in my business
Everybody in my business, why these people in my business?
And these people in my Bentleys
And they flip just like switches
So I can't check the soul
No I can't no, no
No I can't no, no, no (gang)

[Outro]
No I can't trust a soul
Hell nah  I can't trust a soul
All these niggas they be acting just like hoes
Always on my dick on my phone
Well you better watch who you call your bro
Well you better watch who you call your bro (oh oh oh)
They all in my business
