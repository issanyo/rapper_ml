[Intro]
Man you already know who it is man
It's your boy 404 Yachty outchea man

Thinking a nigga tryna be on some lyrical shit nigga
Fuck all that lyrical shit nigga

[Verse]
(Woo!)
Finna make it rumble
Make a nigga stumble
Every show my stage is lookin' like ensemble
Young RD this hottest thing since raw
Pop him in his jaw
Watch his ass fall
Spook you like a thriller
404 driller
Talking down might turn my nigga to a killer
Silent steps every time I make a move
Damn these niggas pussy, dump em' in a lake
Fuck what it take, one take date
Till I'm eating steak, every single night
I don't eat steak, buy cause I can
Stay poppin' rubber band after band
Damn these niggas lookin' pussy with they mans
Imma get em right, gunning fuck a fight
I don't do the drama
Associate with comma
Heard RD was stacking up in Alabama
Bitch your ass guess it, Feeling like Mac
Young Rd the one that sold your mama crack
Gang bangin' with my niggas in the back
404 boy break your bitch back
But I'm still flexin'
Bout to cop the no limit necklace
Day dreamin' bout' Alexis Texas
God damn boy her booty reckless
(Woo!)
Couch rats fiendin' RD 30 beamin'
Shoulder lean while I fuck shit up in nemen
Lookin like a demon
Fuck niggas, Y'all can eat a pound of semen
Middle finger while I'm livin' on a yacht
Fuckin hoes while these niggas tryna plot
Double diamond got me livin' like Scott
Lean on the rocks, Solid to the socks
Booty bitches keep a nigga top notch
Gravy scraper run up on em while they hot
Fuck niggas
Fuck nigga, fuck nigga, suck my cock
