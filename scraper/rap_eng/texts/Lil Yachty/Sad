[Intro: Kodie Shane]
It's the don, baby, baby
Ohhh, yeah

[Chorus: Kodie Shane]
I just wanna be sad
I just wanna be sad babe
Don't you ever have a sad minute?
Ohh yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Kodie Shane]
Why am I the one that's always up in this position?
Why am I the only one wishing that you was missing
Me, like I miss you?
This verse that I'm kicking is all about you
Cause me, and you, like was I really tripping?
Cause I thought me, and you, was supposed to be together
Now I'm sitting here just thinking to myself
It would kill me to see you with somebody else
To do the things you do with a whole 'nother girl
Are you crazy? Boy you mine and no-one else's
Hold me tight like no one else can, competition non-existent
Oh yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Kodie Shane]
Sitting home alone, looking at my phone like
I wish that you would call me and tell me that you're sorry
I'm sitting home alone, looking at my phone like
I wish that you would call me, and tell me that you're sorry

[Chorus: Kodie Shane]
I just wanna be sad
I just wanna be sad babe
Don't you ever have a sad minute?
Ohh yeah, I just wanna be sad for a minute

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat!
Baby, I been working so hard just to get your attention
Your ex-boy mad, yeah I can feel the tension
I guess if he really ain't talking direct
Then he didn't really mention
Nothing 'bout me and you and what we gonna do
How we run up a check on these fools
We matching twin Beamers, we skrt in the lane
All you ex niggas is lame
Your girls telling you not to mess with me just cause my name
Oh woah, they don't wanna see you with Boat
They mad cause I iced out ya throat
Spent a few bands on your coat
Then you left me now I'm all alone, woah
Now I'm sad

[Pre-Chorus: Kodie Shane &  Lil Yachty]
Sitting home alone, looking at my phone like
Looking at my phone
I wish that you would call me
I wish you'd just call
And tell me that you're sorry
I'm sitting home alone, looking at my phone like
Looking at my phone
I wish that you would call me
I wish that you would call
And tell me that you're sorry

[Chorus: Kodie Shane & Lil Yachty]
I just wanna be sad
I just wanna be sad bae
Now I sad
Don't you ever have a sad minute?
Why did you leave me
I just wanna be sad for a minute

[Outro: Lil Yachty & Kodie Shane]
Now I'm sad, ohh, I'm sad
I just wanna be sad for a minute
I'm sad, please call my phone
I just wanna be sad for a minute
