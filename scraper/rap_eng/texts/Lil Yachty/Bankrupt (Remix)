[Verse 1: Cuban Doll]
Hunnid bands, times a hunnid bands
Can you get it, ain't no running man
Keep a hundred rounds, we gon' get him
I ain't never gave a fuck about no bitch
Cause I'm bigger and I'm better
Keep a Smith & Wesson we can do whatever, aye
You say you a boss, I know you a lame
And that nigga ugly what the fuck you saying?
You ain't getting money girl you need a plan
You a broke bitch, always holding out your hand
I'm a real bitch
I just be getting bands
Spend and get it back and I split it with my mans
That money in my hand put it right on your head
Ain't no loss, I'm a boss I can do that shit again, ayy
Fuck a role we speak facts
If a lame bitch talking I won't even speak back
Keep that .45 all black, we strapped, we back
Pop up on 'em make a bitch see that, aye

[Chorus: Cuban Doll]
Fuck all them niggas we gon' fuck up this cash
I hopped out my feelings and I hopped in my bag
Hopped in a foreign, bitch you hopped in a cab
Still living with your mama you ain't hopped off your ass, ayy

[Verse 2: Cuban Doll]
I'm a real bitch I can't fake shit
You a fucking pussy you don't shake shit
You just figured it out bruh you late bitch
You a broke bitch you ain't got no bands to play with
Somewhere out in Cali do the dash in a spaceship
You somewhere in the crib looking mad cause you ain't shit
You ain't tough, big bank take little bank
Bitch you bankrupt
All them hoes losing but they ain't us

[Chorus: Cuban Doll]
Fuck all them niggas we gon' fuck up this cash
I hopped out my feelings and I hopped in my bag
Hopped in a foreign, bitch you hopped in a cab
Still living with your mama you ain't hopped off your ass, ayy
Fuck all them niggas we gon' fuck up this cash
I hopped out my feelings and I hopped in my bag
Hopped in a foreign, bitch you hopped in a cab
Still living with your mama you ain't hopped off your ass, ayy

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
All these mad rappers dirty, and I keep a .30
Spent long nights ridin' low and dirty, now my coupe will spray you
223 cockin', get to jerkin' have them niggas swervin'
Niggas servin', bitches drinkin' bourbon, I remember back when hoes was curvin'
Now I fuck hoes when I wanna (yeah)
Bro used to post on the corner (yeah)
My new bitch is foreigner
Killin' shit, sendin' these hoes to the coroner (yeah)
Don't be sad now a nigga up
AP's goin' dumb, why you comin' over bitch if you ain't tryna make me cum?
Stupid ass bitch, I'll send someone to smack you
Gon' and pull up so my lil sister can stab you
Gang posted up on the corner like a statue
Clip round my chest like a motherfuckin' satchel (ahhh)

[Pre-Chorus: Cuban Doll]
You ain't tough, big bank take little bank
Bitch you bankrupt
All them hoes losing but they ain't us
You ain't tough, big bank take little bank
Bitch you bankrupt
All them hoes losing but they ain't us

[Chorus: Cuban Doll]
Fuck all them niggas we gon' fuck up this cash
I hopped out my feelings and I hopped in my bag
Hopped in a foreign, bitch you hopped in a cab
Still living with your mama you ain't hopped off your ass, ayy
Fuck all them niggas we gon' fuck up this cash
I hopped out my feelings and I hopped in my bag
Hopped in a foreign, bitch you hopped in a cab
Still living with your mama you ain't hopped off your ass, ayy

[Verse 4: Lil Baby]
100 bottles, no sparklers, we already lit
Thousand hunnid, all the bills like its counterfeit
Love the hoe, I slap the bitch, we on some different shit
This shit didn't come from round the way, I'm on some different drip
Sticky, she wanna get with me
I need me a bad broad, then again, a Nicki
Ain't leavin' no witnesses, Christian Lou', a murder scene
Shout out to the homies behind the wall, yeah, the murder team
The old murder team, the ones that can't be silent
Sip promethazine, it got me out my body
Date time, go and throw a dime all in Folly
Big bank take little bank, I'm really gettin' money

[Pre-Chorus: Cuban Doll]
You ain't tough, big bank take little bank
Bitch you bankrupt
All them hoes losing but they ain't us
You ain't tough, big bank take little bank
Bitch you bankrupt
All them hoes losing but they ain't us

[Chorus: Cuban Doll]
Fuck all them niggas we gon' fuck up this cash
I hopped out my feelings and I hopped in my bag
Hopped in a foreign, bitch you hopped in a cab
Still living with your mama you ain't hopped off your ass, ayy
Fuck all them niggas we gon' fuck up this cash
I hopped out my feelings and I hopped in my bag
Hopped in a foreign, bitch you hopped in a cab
Still living with your mama you ain't hopped off your ass, ayy
