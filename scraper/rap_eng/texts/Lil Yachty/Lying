[Hook: Lil Yachty]
These niggas they lyin'
Put diamonds all up in my watch and I can't tell the time
She wanna fuck me and my gang cause she like how we shine
She fuckin and she say she not then I promise she lyin
They lyin', they lyin'

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
These niggas act like they dont know my name i know you be stuck on my Gram
Probably chopped a couple grams
Grab the soda thats a ham
Chevy sittin on 6's
I be stuntin for the bitches
I need all my riches
Paul Wall my dentist
These niggas stuntin like they on, but they know they finished
Chop that bitch down, chop that bitch down turn a lil hoe into a stripper
Its trap season like Flippa
JBan$ my nigga

All these niggas named Mufasa
They mean ass they be lyin
Can't stay in one place I be flyin
Can't fuck on one bitch I need nine

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
These niggas they lyin'

[Verse 2: JBan$]
These lazy bitches ? cookin

Roll the window that's a hundred clip
Hundred hollows to yo mother's lip

Probably somewhere fuckin yo bitch on a yacht
Fuck 12 I can't fuck with no opps (water whippin)
You ain't that nigga boy you a clone bitch
Boost mobile I got three phones bitch (trappin and rappin)
You copy my swag, go on and get yo on shit
Diamonds on diamonds now watch how they fuckin drip (drip drip)
Purple in my cup now watch how I fuckin sip
These niggas they lyin
Their rollies is  tickin and tockin my nigga my shit don't say fuckin time

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
