[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Yeah I'm lit, I'm way too lit, Lil Boat

[Chorus: Andy Milonakis]
Fuck a bitch, fuck a bitch
Fuck a bitch, yo, I'mma fuck that bitch
Yo, I'm lit, yo I'm lit
Yo, I'm lit, yo I'm lit
Got that Henny in my mitt

[Verse 1: Andy Milonakis]
Swerving on Sunday
With thots I met Thursday
Bitches so thirsty
Ho it's not your birthday
Pull up in the station wagon, lime green
Shit you ain't cooking, fine clean
Just another day to tell a ho to kick the rocks
Just another day to tell a ho to kick the rocks

[Chorus: Andy Milonakis]
Fuck a bitch, fuck a bitch
Fuck a bitch, yo, I'mma fuck that bitch
Yo, I'm lit, yo I'm lit
Yo, I'm lit, yo I'm lit
Got that Henny in my mitt
Yo I'm lit

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Yo I'm lit
I'm way too lit
Yeah, I'm lit, I'm way too lit
Up in the sky, top floor
Ten bitches with me and they all whores
Watch how they get down
We gon' run the town
Boy I'm lit, I see you watching from a view
I stay with my dogs like I play stupid cubes

[Chorus: Andy Milonakis]
Fuck a bitch, fuck a bitch
Fuck a bitch, yo, I'mma fuck that bitch
Yo, I'm lit, yo I'm lit
Yo, I'm lit, yo I'm lit
Got that Henny in my mitt
Yo I'm lit, yo I'm lit
