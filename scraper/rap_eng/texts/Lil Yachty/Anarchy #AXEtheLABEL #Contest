[Lil Yachty: Verse]
(Lil Boat!) Stay with the mac like apple
Talking that shit, have them call me a chaple
Young nigga fly, I can fly pterodactyl
Got a new bitch with a son he a rascal
I get the bag from the city, the capitol
These niggas fake and Lil Boat be the actual
Beefing online but in person irrational (Yeah)
I do not get it
Making this money, it's making them live it
The shit that you rap bout, you know you don't live it
I got the coupe with the top, you can lift it
I got the coupe with the engine, go drift it
Diamonds they wet like a cup pour the mystic
Living this life, so futuristic
Stay optimistic

[Hook:] Anarchy, anarchy
My life it look like your fantasy
You can't imagine my salary
Counting my money like calories
Women they all coming after me
Call me a friar like gasoline
I'm on the track it's a masterpiece
I steal your girl that's a tragedy
All of these dudes they mad at me
I keep on balling like 23
No one can stop me it's anarchy
Anarchy, anarchy, anarchy
Aye, ooh, no one can stop me it's anarchy
Anarchy, anarchy, anarchy
No one can stop me it's anarchy

[Lil Yachty: Verse 2]
Off the top of the dome
I'm a big boss, Al Capone
Rocking MCM like my name was Jerome
You want the smoke, told the boy to come on
All of the gang members [?] I'm on
Fuck with the set, look at my phone
I do not club, thats not what I do
I stay at home and sleep in the stu
Plotting on ways to be the revenue
Catch me outside on the old avenue
Been a star player check the attributes
Big body guap since I had substitutes
I know they want the boy hung by a noose
Won't catch me lacking, I stay with the truth
Shooting out roofs in the lot hitting loops
Shoot, shoot, shoot

[Hook:] Yeah anarchy, anarchy
My life it look like your fantasy
You can't imagine my salary
Counting my money like calories
Women they all coming after me
Call me a friar like gasoline
I'm on the track it's a masterpiece
I steal your girl that's a tragedy
All of these dudes they mad at me
I keep on balling like 23
No one can stop me it's anarchy
Anarchy, anarchy, anarchy
Aye, ooh, no one can stop it's anarchy
Anarchy, anarchy, anarchy
No one can stop me it's anarchy
