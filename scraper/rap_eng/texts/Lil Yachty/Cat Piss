'Bout to drop a bomb, Osama bin Laden
Money look like I got Pok√© Balls in my pocket
Blast off on these niggas, young Team Rocket
Country music star, pull up on her like, "Howdy"
She said, "Wowie," just like Maui (Wow)
Took your bitches out like a photo when I cropped it (Wow)
Codename: Kids Next Door my glasses
Sauce I spill so proceed with caution

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
You can get jacked, like a cactus (Yeah)
What is you smoking? Cat piss

I plead the five 'cause I am no snitch (Yeah)

'Cause I then disappear with your bitch, yup (Okay)
You can get jacked, like a cactus (Yeah)
What is you smoking? Cat piss
I'm at the five, Saks Fifth (Yeah), huh
I plead the five 'cause I am no snitch (Yeah)

Water diamonds, Aquaman (Water diamonds, Aqua)
DoodleBob my pants (DoodleBob my pants)
I'ma fuck up these bands, huh (I'ma fuck up these bands)
Water, beach, to the sands, huh (Water, beach, to the sands)
Metal on me like can (Metal on me like, yeah)

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]

Bitch, I don't go back and forth
Nigga might just jack your ho
Glock white like Asher Roth
Actin' hard, we know you soft
Bitch, I don't act hard, I act rich
Gettin' top from a girl with a lisp
In the back of my Bentley (Uh)
Never needed sympathy (Skrrt)
All this gold I own (Yeah)
I could build a chimney (Hoo)
Dissin' online, I do not have the energy (Go)
Drop my top, I'ma ride like the Kennedy's
Sippin' on shit, let it stick to the kidneys (Ah)
Dick in her ribs, let it ring like a symphony
Rich young nigga got a whole lot of entities (Hoo)
Nice to the world, still wake up with enemies
Fuckin' dub, ride on a nigga like Ricky (Ricky)
Still got pussy niggas on my dick (Yeah)
Still countin' M's, not lovin' no chick (Yeah)
Still got watches that just won't tick (Yeah)
Hoo, stick on me, John Wick (Uh)

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
You can get jacked, like a cactus (Yeah)
What is you smoking? Cat piss
I'm at the five, Saks Fifth (Yeah), huh
I plead the five 'cause I am no snitch (Yeah)
After that say hocus pocus
'Cause I then disappear with your bitch, yup (Okay)
You can get jacked, like a cactus (Yeah)
What is you smoking? Cat piss
I'm at the five, Saks Fifth (Yeah), huh
I plead the five 'cause I am no snitch (Yeah)
After that say hocus pocus
