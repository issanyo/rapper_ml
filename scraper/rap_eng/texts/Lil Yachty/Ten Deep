[Hook: K$upreme]
And every time you see me
Nigga I be with the gang, probably ten deep
My niggas stay with me, money stay with me
Bitches stay with me, foreign things stay with me
Flexing on niggas man, these niggas centipedes
I be with the gang, probably ten deep
I be blowing on strong, nigga out that backwood
Hit your ho from the back, she say that dick feel good

[Verse 1: K$upreme]
All these Ben Franklins on me, nigga I feel good
And on my niggas I would never go Hollywood
I smoke a loud loud loud up in Hollywood
I been addicted to this guap since my childhood
Lil nigga posted in my neighborhood
Lil nigga selling weed in high school
My ear look like a fucking ice cube
Got some money then I bought a beamer coupe
Ballin' on niggas then, I was never good at hoops
Splurging, spent a thousand on my shoes
Working, 'til I get a million blues
Never sat on my ass, always on the move

[Hook: K$upreme]
And every time you see me
Nigga I be with the gang, probably ten deep
My niggas stay with me, money stay with me
Bitches stay with me, foreign things stay with me
Flexing on niggas man, these niggas centipedes
I be with the gang, probably ten deep
I be blowing on strong, nigga out that backwood
Hit your ho from the back, she say that dick feel good

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Niggas don't see me hangin' with the fuck arounds
Nope not all
Cause these niggas mama's boys, I'm a fucking hound dog
Running to the fetty, in the cold rocking skin yeti
Yellow jumpsuit, all I need was a real machete (Kill Bill)
K$upreme my blood brother, we be war ready
I done fucked every hatin' bitch just for being petty
All about my O's and my sauce like some kid's spaghetti
Ran it up so much in 2016, not a soul was ready
I get bitches so wet, the way it's really messy
They gon' hate, let 'em hate 'cause them checks comin'
Nigga diss QC again, we gon' start drummin' bitch

[Hook: K$upreme]
And every time you see me
Nigga I be with the gang, probably ten deep
My niggas stay with me, money stay with me
Bitches stay with me, foreign things stay with me
Flexing on niggas man, these niggas centipedes
I be with the gang, probably ten deep
I be blowing on strong, nigga out that backwood
Hit your ho from the back, she say that dick feel good

[Hook: K$upreme]
And every time you see me
Nigga I be with the gang, probably ten deep
My niggas stay with me, money stay with me
Bitches stay with me, foreign things stay with me
Flexing on niggas man, these niggas centipedes
I be with the gang, probably ten deep
I be blowing on strong, nigga out that backwood
Hit your ho from the back, she say that dick feel good
