[Intro: PnB Rock & Lil Yachty]
Oh yeah
Yeah
Lil Boat!

[Hook: PnB Rock]
I've been trapping all day (trapping all day)
I've been trapping all day (trapping all day)
But the whole time I've been thinking about you
The whole time I've been thinking about you
Like I gotta get home
But I gotta get there
I've been out here trapping with my crew
But the whole time I've been thinking bout you
I've been trapping all day (trapping all day)
I've been trapping all day (trapping all day)
But the whole time I've been thinking about you
The whole time I've been thinking about you
Like I gotta get home
But I gotta get there
I've been out here trapping with my crew
But the whole time I've been thinking bout you

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I've been thinking bout you, swear I've been thinking bout you
I ain't been home lately, but trust when I do
I'll give it all to you, put that on my name
I treat you just like royalty and you do the same
All these other hoes lame, I won't fuck where we got 'em
'Cause what we got is insane, when I get back I might cop you that ring

[Hook: PnB Rock & Lil Yachty]
[I've been trapping all day (trapping all day)
I've been trapping all day (trapping all day)
But the whole time I've been thinking about you
The whole time I've been thinking about you
Like I gotta get home
But I gotta get there
I've been out here trapping with my crew
But the whole time I've been thinking bout you

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
I've been trapping out the bando
Jugging off the flip phone
Making all these racks, though
Whole time I swear I've been thinking about you
Girl, I swear, everything about you
It got me open, girl, I loose focus
When I be out on my grind, money be all on my mind
But you've been on my mind, too
Girl, I'm so glad that I found you
You bag all my Nick's and Dimes, too
We jugg and we get it, we mix in the kitchen
You help move my pounds, too
That's why you be on my mind
When I be out on my grind
This life it ain't for you
Trying to make you my baby, mine

[Hook: PnB Rock]
I've been trapping all day (trapping all day)
I've been trapping all day (trapping all day)
But the whole time I've been thinking about you
But the whole time I've been thinking about you
Like I gotta get home (skrr, skrr)
But I gotta get there
I've been out here trapping with my crew
But the whole time I've been thinking bout you
I've been trapping all day (trapping all day)
I've been trapping all day (trapping all day)
But the whole time I've been thinking about you
But the whole time I've been thinking about you
Like I gotta get home (skrr, skrr)
But I gotta get there
I've been out here trapping with my crew
But the whole time I've been thinking bout you

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Trapping all day
Trap, trap, trapping all day
I had to make me a wave
Make me a wave so you stay
I work so you can just play
I rap so they can just pay
Niggas be all in the way
Give them no answers, like Sway
Because you stay on my mind while I'm out
Bring home that sack every night, there's no doubt
Been had the guap since a spout
Never ever going back to that drought
Lil Boat
