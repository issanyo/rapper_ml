[Introduction: Lil Yachty]
I go on (I go on)
I go on and on
I go on (Lil Boat)
I go on and on I go on (Digital Nas)

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I go on (I go on)
I go on (I go on)
I go on (I go on)
I go on (I go on)
I go on and on about my team
I go on and on about my jewelry
I go on (I go on)
I go on (I go on)
I go on (I go on)
I go on (I go on)
I go on and on about my team
I go on and on about my jewelry and how it bling

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I pop my shit
I will not stop
I will not quit, no
I'm on the rise
I'm on the rise
I'm on the rise
Without my guys
Without my bros
Put all of my bros before a hoe
I need 25 thousand for every show
Most these niggas be flexin' up on the low
But I ain't trippin' I'm fuckin' up on they hoes
I go on and on about my gang, 'bout my life, 'bout about my family
And we how livin' so good and how we stuntin' so hard
Niggas be hating I'm finna pull they card, woah

[Interlude: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat!

[Chorus: Lil Yachty & Seppe]
I go on (hoo)
I go on (I go on)
I go on (I go on)
I go on (I go on)
I go on and on about my team (skrr skrr)
I go on and on about my jewelry (skrrrr)
I go on (I go on)
I go on (I go on)
I go on (I go on)
I go on (yes I go on)
I go on and on about my team (skrr skrr)
I go on and on about my jewelry and how it bling

[Verse 2: Seppe]
Back in [?], niggas causing trouble
Youngest nigga with it, I had tryna hustle
Need my dividends, money over friends
Only was eleven, touched my first band
Youngest with the bag, meet my brother Seppe
Now I'm sixteen, diamonds on my neck
Remember rocking Diamond, now I'm rocking 'Preme
[?] on the jeans, and I'm signing checks
Nigga came to flex
Thinking how you wanted money that I'm pressed
Never look at me boy Bogo on the chest
Diamonds in my chain, gold all in my range
Platinum for the rest, niggas throwin' deals
Tell me shine on paper, lemme see the mill's
Money over bitches, bitches get you killed
Only care 'bout family, they gon' keep it real
Gang gon' keep it still
Never want problems
Just keep it on us 'cause niggas be watching
Want what I got, but I won't let 'em have it
Pockets so fat get kicked out the club, niggas think that I'm packing
Niggas some fools
My niggas be toting on shit from cartoons
Some niggas keep apes and couple baboons
Baboons and snakes and the apes [?] my niggas some goons
I tell 'em be cool
I call all the shots I been making the moves
I came in here flexin' just stunt with my jewels
I ain't with the talking, can't peep how I move
And just like a cat bitch don't get yours removed
Don't get us confused
We came from the bottom of course we gon' shout to my brothers I got 'em
They all down to blow if some niggas run up then they ready to drop

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I go on (hoo)
I go on (I go on)
I go on (I go on)
I go on (I go on)
I go on and on about my team (skrr skrr)
I go on and on about my jewelry (skrrrr)
I go on (I go on)
I go on (I go on)
I go on (I go on)
I go on (yes I go on)
I go on and on about my team (skrr skrr)
I go on and on about my jewelry and how it bling

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat!
