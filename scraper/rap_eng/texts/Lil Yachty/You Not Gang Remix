[Hook 1: Levi Carter]
You know Papi, A-Okay!
I might move a brick today
I finessed the plug today
I took all his drugs today
I won't show no love today
Right now you catch a slug today

[Hook 2: Levi Carter]
Who are you? You not gang
Get the fuck away from me
Who are you? You not gang
Who are you? You not gang
I don't look at you that way
Never looked at you that way
Who are you? You not gang
Who are you? You not gang
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away from me

[Hook 1: Levi Carter]
You know Papi, A-Okay!
I might move a brick today
I finessed the plug today
I took all his drugs today
I won't show no love today
Right now you catch a slug today
Who are you? You not gang
Get the fuck away from me

[Verse 1: Levi Carter]
Pop a pill, put a four in my Sprite
I see bitches kissing dykes
I see niggas whipping white
It's a trap house at the spot
It's like Apple at the spot
It's a match back at the spot
See you lackin', you get gut
Know some niggas hatin' on me
Flex with pictures on IG
And them niggas ain't kill me yet
I ain't going, I ain't dying
See you winning? They start crying
They be mad cus' they be trying
But I keep that Glock on me
I ain't going, I ain't dying
Eat a dick, hoe
I could fuck your bitch, she got no choice
Military hoes the worst, she getting fucked while you deployed
You know she don't play with toys
She just wanna swallow my boys
Then come right back to the trap
Just to see my brand new store

[Hook 2: Levi Carter]
Who are you? You not gang
Who are you? You not gang
I don't look at you that way
Never looked at you that way
Who are you? You not gang
Who are you? You not gang
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away from me

[Hook 1: Levi Carter & Lil Yachty]
You know Papi, A-Okay!
I might move a brick today
I finessed the plug today
I took all his drugs today
I won't show no love today
Right now you catch a slug today (What up Nas?)
Who are you? (Aye) You not gang
Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat
Get the fuck away from me

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Chopper chopper knock yo block up
Bentley Coupe I drop the top off (skrr skrr)
My regular bitch just clocked out
She can't wait to take her top off
Niggas actin' friendly, others hate
'Cause they simply envy
Now the hating bond any niggas doin' songs with me
To raise they clout (they clout)
If all else fails, then go rap bills (go rap bills)
Run up on boat catch a shell (dududu dududu)
Fuck that lil bitch after 12 (hey)
Niggas not gang with me (no)
Niggas didn't jug, just 'cause we could
Back when I used to smoke bud (hey)
Back when I didn't get butt (alright)
Now I fuck bitches all night (all night)
Just 'cause they see me on Sprite (on Sprite)
These bitches wanna live the life
But these bitches get one night, oh
I'm too rich to ever fight though
I just fuck a nigga wife though
Keep that one more than 21 than 22 no this shit not a knife, no

[Hook 2: Levi Carter]
Who are you? You not gang
Get the fuck away from me
Who are you? You not gang
Who are you? You not gang
I don't look at you that way
Never looked at you that way
Who are you? You not gang
Who are you? You not gang
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away from me

[Hook 1: Levi Carter]
You know Papi, A-Okay!
I might move a brick today
I finessed the plug today
I took all his drugs today
I won't show no love today
Right now you catch a slug today
Who are you? You not gang
Get the fuck away from me
