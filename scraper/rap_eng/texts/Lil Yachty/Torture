[Verse 1: Lil' Yachty]
Westside, bitch nigga
Ducked off, swapping joints
Stacking up the figures
Nigga run up, he can catch a 30-clip
To his bottom lip
Damn
How you do it?
Nigga spent a whole half at Gucci
How the fuck you get the pussy juicy?
Nigga bout to hit a triple deucy
She gon' fuck and blame it on the Goosey
That's the Act, young nigga don't drink alcohol
$30,000 in my back pocket
I'll slap a nigga if he talking crazy
I don't play that shit
Lil' Boat got the 30-clip
Young nigga finna let it rip like a Beyblade
Young nigga, you can catch the fade
If you think it's sweet
Young nigga get his ass beat
If he talking down on a nigga gang
Chain swing, nigga 30 deep
Young nigga keep a lotta heat
Like a young nigga ball for Miami
Young nigga need like 10 Grammies
Stack it tall for a nigga family
Had the nickname Glock Stanley
Cuz' that shit is my Steamer
Pull up on 'em in a Beamer
Oh Damn
How he do it?
All these niggas wanna be pursuers
All these niggas wanna be like you
How the fuck you get it out the mud?
What's your newest crew?
Never switched up on the game
Young nigga have to let it hang

[Verse 2: Kordless]
Bitch I feel too sexy
There's nothing that you can tell me
I might call up Lexi
I'm so sure that she miss me
I'm Papi Chulo
Ay, callate por favor, puto
Uh
My pockets fat like sumo
Kick a door like judo
Then I gotta flex
Chanel dripping on my neck
I'm a lovable piece of shit
I'm on these chumps heads, so intense
Pussy niggas can't be on my presence
Catching fades, don't need me a weapon
So don't ever question
Pray to God, here's my confession
Until then I'ma keep on finessin'
I know you wanna ride the wave
I know you see me getting cake
I'm so sorry that you lame
Nigga just stay in your lane
Fuck on your bitch cuz' I'm bangin'
Most of my niggas is dangerous
If the cops come, my nigga
I only speak sign language, ay
I see what they didn't see
And thank you to the ones that turned on me
Now my dreams are my reality
I'm much more beyond the normality
Hey
I whip it hard 'til I faint
I do what these other niggas can't
I'm rolling up and it stank
What the fuck did you think?

Young nigga stay with them racks, ay
Young nigga stay moving bags, ay
Young nigga stay with them racks, ay
Young nigga stay moving bags, ay
