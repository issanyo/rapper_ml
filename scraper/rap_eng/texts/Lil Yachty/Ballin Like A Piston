[Verse 1:Lil Yachty]
Up late night, bitch I'm feeling like I'm Jimmy Fallon
10 diamond rings on my hand like I'm good at sports
Bought a new crib and that bitch came with a tennis court
Flexin' should have been a sport
I done took it all the way
August 23, Mark your calendar, that's RD day
Walked up in that bitch with two bitches you ain't never seen
Perfect parts got me so clean
Paint the Glock white, add the laser, that's vanilla bean
Oops I meant vanilla beam
Counting so much money that my fingers started turning green
Winning so damn much that I now here go by as Charlie Sheen
All these hoes is easy bust
In my squad is who i trust
Old ass rappers talking dust, niggas need to die
One time this bitch had hurt my feelings, so i went to ice the pain
VVS my whole team
Ballin' like I'm Larry Bird
Drop that bitch off at the curb
She was asking too much questions
Nah bitch I'm never stressin
Youngest nigga ever flexin
You broke if yo ass stressin
Yo bitch who my ass texting
Fucked yo bitch head, then I told her that she not a slut
Lyin cuz i ain't give no fucks
Drop my nut all on her butt
Xans got my body stuck
Leaning I might need a crutch
Call up K Supreme, and we about to pour a whole eighth
None of you pussy niggas safe
Keep my cash all in a safe
Smoking good and living great
Features come with pricy rates
Living like the Apple State
Nigga, Oooh!

[Hook]
Young RD always had alot of bitches
Pullin up on switches, diamond chain viscious
Hoes loving me cuz I'm balling like a piston
I'm balling like a piston
I'm balling like a piston (2x)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty}​​​​​​
Man, shout out my nigga Christian
She always keep my braids lit
Fuck with her your neck split
Whole gang coming for the top like a volcano
First check and these niggas put they mama in a range rover
Some put in a bankroll
I got old money, I should by my self a Kangol
Got whips like Django and bitches like James Franco
Diamonds dancing hard, so my necklace doing the tango
My bitches look like angels, got stripes like a Bengal
