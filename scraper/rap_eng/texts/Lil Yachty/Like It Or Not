[Intro]
They say misery loves company
But I hate when you’re not around ‘cause I’m lonely
Got me out here, beggin’ on both knees
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Verse 1 : Chris Brown]
Girl, I ain't fuck you in a minute, remember lovin’ in the shower?
Pussy, that's my dinner, fuck a kitchen
Round two, need a 5 minute intermission
Round three, kama sutra, every sex position
I love when you make them faces
Too beautiful, you don’t need no make-up (make-up)
‘Cause, you a dime already
I need a type of bad bitch, sleepin’ by my side when I wake up
And all my diamonds shinin’
Let me light you up, you know our time is priceless
I-i-I know that this your first time, live it up

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You say you, live it up when you need me
It was over ‘cause I put my faith in you
Yeah, hella cocky, I’m conceited, hella charged up
Bitch, I’m in my feelings for a fuckin' reason

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain't got to lie to you (no)
If you ain't in love then why do it?
Shattered my heart
Fuckin’ bitches ‘cause we fell apart
And, you know I’ma go to war for you
Like it or not (no)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You say you, live it up when you need me
It was over ‘cause I put my faith in you
Yeah, hella cocky, I’m conceited, hella charged up
Bitch, I’m in my feelings for a fuckin' reason

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain't got to lie to you (no)
If you ain't in love then why do it?
Shattered my heart
Fuckin’ bitches ‘cause we fell apart
And, you know I’ma go to war for you
Like it or not (no)
