[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Nigga my life is too mobile
All these young niggas know I'm a mogul
Stack it up, count it up
Stack it up, count it up
Nigga my life is too mobile
All these young niggas know I'm a mogul
Stack it up, count it up

You know they don't count it up
Nigga count it up
Stack it up count it up

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Stack it up count it up boy you so broke I can't even hang around you
All them niggas in your gang they look like clowns around you
NAZ we countin' cheddar, I ran it up better
I'm countin way more cheddar
And a nigga so fly the mayor wrote me a letter
Tellin me how I go hard, nigga shoot like a point guard
I got my goons in your yard
And we waitin till you come out cause they know you tried to rob the squad
Dang, bad move
All you niggas is some damn fools
Suckin dick tryna get on and I don't fuck with you niggas

But I heard your ass was just foolin

Juug life music like I'm fuckin young scooter
Niggas talkin reckless over the computer
