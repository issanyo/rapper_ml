[Chorus: K$upreme]
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
I fuck her once when I punt the bitch
Head to toe I want designer shit
Pull up in foreign I all kinds of shit
My neck and wrist it be blinding shit
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
Run with that sack but don't fumble it

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
[?] it bitch don't want to humble bitch
These niggas mad cuz' I mumble shit
Hang with the slimes like I'm Thugga bitch
Got a new watch and it's plain jane, man I can't wait to flood the bitch
Talk to my sister gon jug a bitch
Hate giving dick to a sucker bitch
Balling no NBA, Rucker shit
Been a long time since I loved a bitch
Keep a cold heart, no from the start, niggas backstab with a throwing dart

[Chorus: K$upreme]
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
I fuck her once when I punt the bitch
Head to toe I want designer shit
Pull up in foreign I all kinds of shit
My neck and wrist it be blinding shit
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
Run with that sack but don't fumble it

[Verse 2: HoodrichPabloJuan]
Running with the sack and I ain't gonna fumble
Water get wet like Pirannah
Fuck that nigga like a comma
You ain't go no shooters like Thunder
My diamonds African, Wakanda
Made a million dollars off a mumble
Remix a nigga like drama
Big bankroll in my pockets all hundreds
Bad bitches blowing kisses in the comments
Make the choppa sing, Gunna
Glock with the forty kick back like a punter
He tried to run I had to hunt him
Come get your bitch nigga, I don't really want her
Roll a backwood like [?]
Talk to police, we don't fuck with your mama
Bitch ass nigga, I'm gon' blitz that nigga
I'm coming for that sack you better not fumble

[Chorus: K$upreme]
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
I fuck her once when I punt the bitch
Head to toe I want designer shit
Pull up in foreign I all kinds of shit
My neck and wrist it be blinding shit
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
Run with that sack but don't fumble it
