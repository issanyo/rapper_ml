[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Free the Ruler
Never goin' broke ho, used to ride in Volvos
Taught hoes with vatos
Young with a semi, gettin' more brain than Jimmy
Black hood bitch, had to nickname her Lil Kimmy
Fresh up out the bank, neck on water like Frank
I might cop me a tank
I ain't kissin' that bitch 'cause her breath smell like dank
You a clout chasin' ho tryna double up your rank
Bitch I'm ratchet with that clank, flu flam

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
I'm fresh up out the slammer, I'm a flu flammer nigga
All these chains on my neck, I need two whammers nigga
Flu flamming nigga, I be flu flamming nigga
Man keep these niggas out my business
I'm fresh up out the slammer, I'm a flu flammer nigga
All these chains on my neck, I need two whammers nigga
Flu flamming nigga, I be flu flamming nigga
Man keep these niggas out my business

[Verse 2: Ohgeesy]
My fuck game serious
She wanna try, she curious
Niggas they be gossipin' but I ain't really hearin' it, ain't fearin' shit
I'm posted with some killers, gorillas
Just dropped an eight of that Wock' in vanilla
That Faygo, ayy bro, free Drakeo
We gon' hit 'em with the Karo
Free my niggas out of jail
Ralfy, Ketchy, Sayso
Flu flam, we was flu flamming pesos

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
I'm fresh up out the slammer, I'm a flu flammer nigga
All these chains on my neck, I need two whammers nigga
Flu flamming nigga, I be flu flamming nigga
Man keep these niggas out my business
I'm fresh up out the slammer, I'm a flu flammer nigga
All these chains on my neck, I need two whammers nigga
Flu flamming nigga, I be flu flamming nigga
Man keep these niggas out my business

[Verse 3: Drakeo the Ruler]
I be ling ling bopping, Maylene just took me shopping
Nigga rob who? Pippi Long Stocking
All type of cuts, I think I'm Dennis Rodman
Slit wrist, broke all off these diamonds
Mister wrist breaker, bitch taker
Mister Glock, but I switch blade 'em
Shit mainy, shit crazy, niggas in these snitch tactics
Niggas they be bitch asses, actin' like they get at me
You'll get your shit plastered, nigga

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
I'm fresh up out the slammer, I'm a flu flammer nigga
All these chains on my neck, I need two whammers nigga
Flu flamming nigga, I be flu flamming nigga
Man keep these niggas out my business
I'm fresh up out the slammer, I'm a flu flammer nigga
All these chains on my neck, I need two whammers nigga
Flu flamming nigga, I be flu flamming nigga
Man keep these niggas out my business
