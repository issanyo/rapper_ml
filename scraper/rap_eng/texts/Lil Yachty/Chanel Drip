Putting Chanel on her shoulder
Strapped with a gun like a solider
Nigga charged up like a Mophie
I love this girl like a trophy
[?]
Keep talking down you don't know me
That nigga, that boy the set
Put the 30 round clip in the mac
At the crib on the couch is a tec
Put a big bullet hole in your back
Damn your niggas they don't know how to act
I switch it up with them boys on the block that be flipping packs
Tell him take a nap, pussy nigga boy on your life no cap
Middle finger up to a opp
Ball hard [?] like [?]
Neck on burr like the Wopster

Walking round with my chopper, yeah
You know it, you know it, you know it
Yeah, yeah, [?]

Money stretch like Luffy
Blowing dope no loose leaf

A bad bitch named Pookie
Let her suck my dick, lick lick lick, I'm like oowee
Lemme teach you niggas how to drip, oomie zoomie
Bitch I'm at Barneys right now, your ass at Zumiez
I can't pick between these Rick Owen's or these Gucci's
Everytime I walk in, it don't matter it's a movie
Tell that bitch to get in tune not no Looney
They like Trippie, who me, bitch what it do-ee
Chanel drip, chanel drip, chanel drip
