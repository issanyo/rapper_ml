[Intro]
It's Lil Boat, out of sight

[Hook]
Where have you been
Where have you been, not in my life lately
Where have you been, out of sight (ya)
Where have you been (where you been)
Where have you been, not in my life lately (no no)
Where have you been, you been out of sight
Where have you been, where have you been, where have you been my love
Where have you been, you've been out of sight (yeah, yeah)
Where have you been, where you been, where you been my life
Where have you been, you've been out of sight

[Verse]
Where have you been (where)
Where have you been you should bring all your friends
Get out your clothes, I'll get out of mine (facts)
You is a ten, from the tips of your toes to the hair on your head and your chin
You make me grin 'cause I know you mine
Let's fuck in the benz
Hit 100 [to the highway I almost?] crashed and do it again
You my best friend where you been all my life
When I'm with you I feel so wrong, so wrong it feels right
We like Bonnie and Clyde, we like Bonnie and Clyde

[Hook 2]
Where have you been (where)
Where have you been, not in my life lately (lately)
Where have you been, out of sight
Where have you been
Where have you been, not in my life lately
Where have you been, you been out of sight (you've been out of sight)
Where have you been, where have you been, where have you been my love
Where have you been, you've been out of sight
Where have you been, where you been, where you been my life
Where have you been, you've been out of sight

[Verse 2]
Better late than never
I've been looking for you since forever
When I'm with you I feel so much better
When I'm with you I feel like a king
Summer time let the jewellery bling, watch the jewellery blau
Let's take a trip out to Moscow
Let's take a ride on a black cow
Let's take a trip to your momma house
Let's see how Miss Lady doing
I love all the dreams you pursuing (I do)
Before you my whole life was ruined (it was)
I went through hell with my ex (pssh)
You look way better than Susan (for real)
You got them bitch niggas choosing (you do)
If they touch you there's gon' be a bruising
I cannot wait 'til you move in

[Outro]
You've been out of sight, oh, oh, oh, oh out of sight
Oh, oh, oh, you've been out of sight
Oh, oh, oh out of sight
