[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Bitch I'm drippin' on these niggas, drip drop
It's a real rollie it don't tick tock
Savage ridin' round the city with that Glock
Get that dick on it, I'ma let it pop
Let it pop, bitch you better run
It ain't no fun, when young Savage got the gun
I drop bombs on these niggas like Osama
Keep the Don Cannon they don't want no drama

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Flyest nigga you ever seen, I'm the king of the teens
Hydro codeines, caught serving beans to the fiends
My new bitch Billy Jean, old bitch Tina Turner, keep the burner
Old hunnids Tom Joyner, my new bitch is a foreigner
My new wrist cost a 36, that's a quarter brick or three shows
I could've iced my ear lobes, I'd rather split it with my bros

[Hook]
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin

[Verse 3: Sauce Walka]
Lil' bitch Iâ€™m Sauce Farrakhan, Sauce-Alaikum, A-Sauce-Salaam
I got so much flavor nigga
Swear to God that I'm Tony Chachere son
Aunt Jemima might be my mama
Drippin' sauce how I make the commas
Poured everything out the bottle
Red bottom feet hand made iguana
When I walk off it's a murder scene
Rolls got my wrist it look Burgundy
I made your bitch buy a fur for me
It wasn't even cold, hell it was spring
Sauce-Ebola, epidemic got the world drippin' over
Thanks to Sauce harbor now I'm on a little boat with 21 soldiers

[Hook]
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin
