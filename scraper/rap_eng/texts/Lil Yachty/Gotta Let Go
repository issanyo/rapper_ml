[Verse 1: Swaghollywood]
I don't know why all these niggas in my business
All I know they copy and they pay attention
Lil' Swag got two bitches, he love his riches
I can't trust these hoes cause they steady snitchin'
Oh no, Lil' Swag on a boat
Gotta let go
Let's take a toast
I need the bread, so give me the loaf
I need 2k for a show
Shawty, she doin' the most
I might let go like a frisbee
Lil' Swag he make it look easy, yah
Bitch you gon' see me on tv, yah
I keep the racks like Serena, yah
Lil' Swag gon' count up these bankrolls
Shawty do what I might say so
It ain't nowhere that I can't go
It's Lil' Swag I gotta let go

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Lil' nigga you gotta let go
It's Lil Boat we got yours
I need 3 racks for a show
I need 4 racks for a show, damn
Fuck up, the fuck for IG
I do it for you and I do it for me
Yeah, Maison Margiela my t-shirt
1500 for a Boat verse
No I don't do no volunteer work
No Lil Boat he ain't got no charges
So don't ask me for a free verse
She fuck me just cause she thirsty
My new bitch brown like some Hershey's
She suck me up for her purses
She get whatever she want
As long as she leave me alone, damn
