[Hook: Wintertime Zi]
I don't remember, I don't remember
Bitch I'm so cold, yeah I'm so December
Chasing this cheddar, chasing this cheddar
She gon take drugs with me if I let her
I don't remember, I don't remember
Bitch I'm so cold, yeah I'm so December
Chasing this cheddar, chasing this cheddar
She gon take drugs with me if I let her

[Verse 1: Wintertime Zi]
And ima let her, I want her ima get her
Birds of a feather they flock together
I'm so September, no no I'm so November
Damn I'm so cold, yeah I'm so December
I'm so December with it, so December with it
I want it, I'ma get it
She wanna spend time together
I told her I ain't with it
I ain't got no time for bitches
The only thing that's on my mind is business
I gotta get to these riches
I can't worry about no women
It's plenty fish in the sea
I'm with Lil Boat, we go fishing
I'm with Lil Boat and we with it
Juggin', finessin' lets get it
She told me I'm cold as the winter
Bitch I just want me a million
Aye run it up, run it up, run it up all I wanna do
Get it up, spend it all, make it back back times two
Niggas want a Winter verse, Winter verse
Yeah I'm taxing you
If your money short get the fuck, I ain't getting back to you
I will not get back
You niggas need back back
You clap at us and we clap back
North Face x Supreme my backpack
Bad bitches rubbing my back
I'm rolling up smoking gas
Winter I keep it a buck
I'm speaking nothing but facts
Y'all niggas lie in y'all raps
You never been to the trap
You pussy, I know you a fag
And you know your music trash
Hit a hundred on the dash
Live like everyday my last
No license no insurance
Bitch you know I can't crash
I run it, I run it, I run it, I run it, I run it
I'm a running back, I'm a running back, I'm a running back
We finna score on these hoes
I'm finna score on these hoes
I bring it back, I bring it back
It's Wintertime and Lil Boat

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
I don't remember, I don't remember
Bitch I'm so cold, yeah I'm so December
I'm chasing this cheddar, chasing this cheddar
She gon hit juugs with me if I let her
I don't remember, I don't remember
Bitch I'm so cold, yeah I'm so December
I'm chasing this cheddar, chasing this cheddar
She gon hit juugs with me if I let her

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Triple M, triple M on my sweaters
That mean it's Margiela, mean it's Margiela
That nigga not hard, he soft as a feather
Bitch that's not your Louie, that shit fake leather
So stop biting my swag, get it together
I might fuck up that fuck up just for the weather
Stepping out of my zone I'm in the game
She gon choose me every time cause of my name
Lose it then get it right back at the count up gon always redouble
Lose it then get it right back, get it back how it was with no trouble
I love my bitch cause she holding shit down I might make us a couple
No I'm lying, but that bitch my favorite dime
I can't trust none of you ops
Want a verse to pay that fine
But the fine just for my teeth
Just so they could say good grief
You know, you know, you know
And you know, you know, you know, you know how it go
And I can't trust none of you niggas cause you niggas watching us
You niggas plotting on us
I had to hush my homie cause y'all be acting phony
I had my chopper with me just in case he ran up on me
And free the lord, yeah free all my boys
Shawty tryna fuck with Yachty cause she hear I'm making noise
That's when I turn them off
That's when I count it up
That's when I copped the Beamer truck
For those who ain't wish me luck
But I don't need your luck no
I'm counting, counting up these bucks woah
Aye it's Wintertime and Lil Boat woah
You know the game finna blow

[Hook: Wintertime Zi]
I don't remember, I don't remember
Bitch I'm so cold, yeah I'm so December
Chasing this cheddar, chasing this cheddar
She gon take drugs with me if I let her
I don't remember, I don't remember
Bitch I'm so cold, yeah I'm so December
Chasing this cheddar, chasing this cheddar
She gon take drugs with me if I let her
