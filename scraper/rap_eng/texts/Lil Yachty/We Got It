[Intro]
Lil Boat
Let's go you
OG Parker, oh damn
Big Rich, Lil Boat, King Rich, uh, woah, woah, woah

[Lil Yachty]
3600 that's in my left pocket
Young nigga ballin' John Stockton
You not poppin', stop it
I take off just like a lil rocket
My dick in her throat if she don't tell me stop it

[Rich The Kid]
Hittin' that bitch in the back of the Bentley
Balmains got a semi
Flexin' you act like you got it
Stop it, walk in the club with the pocket rocket

[Lil Yachty]
Damn, walk in the club with the auto spitter
My bitch don't use no filter
Came in the club with bout 60 goons
And they all keep tools, Bob the Builder
Make 'em sing like Aretha Franklin
Youngest nigga in the world bankin'

[Rich The Kid]
Hundred racks, I got it on me like a bottle of paint
Double cup poured up, I'm on Easter pink
And it ain't no fun if the gang can't hit it
That's your ho on the perc, pussy good come with it

[Lil Yachty]
Damn that ho a little thottie she fucked on my bro
24 inches, I sit above the floor
In another country with Lil Rich here, we shoppin' at different stores
I know you niggas tryna figure out where we got this shit
26 goin' nigga rich

[Rich The Kid]
Back to the thottie, I'm breakin' her body
Switch it then pass her to Lil Yachty
Over sea bitch, got her on her knees
100 bands, can't sit on double Gs
That's your ho but I took her to the trap
Maserati, don't ask me how I got it

[Lil Yachty]
Don't ask me how I got it, pull off in the Audi
Pussy nigga, diamonds lookin' cloudy

[Hook: Lil Yachty]

[Rich The Kid]
Whole lotta money on me right now
Pop a molly tear the dome right down
I'ma fuck your bitch, put her on TMZ
She gon' pop the pussy on DVD

[Lil Yachty]
Woah, I stole the bitch heart and I'm CDG
Triple them sweaters, I get bitches wetter
She gon' come with me cause she think Lil Boat better
I'm ballin' so hard my whip is basketball leather

[Rich The Kid]
10 chains, 12 chains on me right now
Drop a baby in the pot
Grab it put it on a boat
El Chapo with the dope
