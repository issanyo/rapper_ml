[Hook]
I been stuntin, I been stuntin, I been stuntin
I been stuntin, I been stuntin, I been stuntin
I been stuntin, I been stuntin, I been stuntin
I been stuntin, I been stuntin, I been stuntin

[Verse]
Baby girl, it ain't no frontin', fuck with me, you gon' be stuntin
My new lil bitch she be rushin', she gon' bust it at your stomach
Walk around with 30 thousand,I'm a walkin' trust fund
All my hundreds they be blue like blueberry dum dums
That's a sucker for you suck ass niggas
I been ballin like a rucker park ass nigga
I say fuck 12 and fuck all ya fuck ass niggas
Duwap, stay 'way from all these fuck ass niggas
You think they help you out, but they really duck ass niggas
All you scary niggas, chicken cluck ass niggas
Whoa, damn shout to Fresh thats my bro and Im in Philly we fuck hoes
I need 10 bands for a show, coutin up my meatloaf
Icy, icy, ice neck, lookin like a walkin'  check
Nigga run up on lil boat, oh my god, he gon' be done
And I'm never ever lyin in my verses
Your lil boy has guap, I spent that shit on mamas purses

[Hook]
I been stuntin, I been stuntin, I been stuntin
I been stuntin, I been stuntin, I been stuntin
Baby fuck with the boat, ain't no frontin'
I been stuntin, I been stuntin, I been stuntin
I been stuntin, I been stuntin, I been stuntin
I been stuntin, I been stuntin, I been stuntin
Baby fuck with the boat, ain't no frontin'
I been stuntin, I been stuntin, I been stuntin
