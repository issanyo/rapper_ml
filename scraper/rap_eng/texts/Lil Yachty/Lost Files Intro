[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I don't think niggas will ever think like I do
NAZ we the new 2 live crew
Yachty been poppin' bottles, poppin' pussy
Crackin' seal left and right
Niggas hatin', niggas wanna fight cause I flex ice
Cook crack like a bag of rice
Diamonds get you chill, poltergeist
Bitches love me, they get one night

[Interlude: Lil Yachty]
NAZ, NAZ, NAZ
Now where the fuck my brothers at you feel me?
NAZ shit till I die, never amount to zero
That shit tatted on my skin you feel me?
These niggas ain't really stackin' up
These niggas mental aren't on the green you know what I'm sayin?
Niggas thinkin' 'bout cheese like I'm from Greenbay you feel me?
Like niggas ain't really really tryna stack it up namsayin?
Live by the code, die by the code namsayin?
This me and my brothers til the motherfuckin' end

[Verse 2: K$upreme & Lil Yachty]
Pint of lean, now I'm leanin', got me lookin' like a demon
Bang bang, skeet her then I delete her
You the type of nigga say I mistreat her
And I got my heater and I'm off the meter
She say that she love me, I don't believe
NAZ we comin', doot, doot, doot, doot doot, niggas start runnin'
Off the boof feelin' good, smokin' boof out the wood
V8 engine in my hood, got a nigga ridin' good
Toolie on me like a tumor
Bitches talkin' startin' rumors, I swear I hate 'em
Actin' like they ain't swallow Yachty junior
Duckin' on 'em like an OK Sooner
Teeth shiny like a box of bullets
He talkin' crazy, we might pull it
Bitch on my dick, yeah she chew it
White diamonds on my teeth call 'em Jewish
True to my gang like a Buddhist
