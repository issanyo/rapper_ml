[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Want a drop top
Take your top off
Doing 80 in a 30, fuck a cop law
When I get home this lil bitch gon' suck my cock off
So I'm goin' fast, I'm talkin' super dash
Bitch from Birmingham, known for serving yams
Ain't gotta worry 'bout her, 'cause she hate the cam

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Yeah, everything we do is in private
Everything we do is private
Everything we do is private
Yeah, everything we do is private

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Knocking shit down like a wrecking ball
All my hoes in checkers, she don't pick up first time, she got second call
Don't talk about ice unless my neck involved
Don't talk about, don't talk about sex unless my dick involved
I hopped out the (skrt) hopped in the (skrt)
Fender bender, big spender
Money lender, gang member, gang member
Shit ain't been the same since 2015 of December
At least I remember

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Everything we do is in private, yeah
Everything we do is private
Everything we do is private
Yeah, everything we do is private

[Verse 3: Trouble]
Everything private, on Spiffy, fifteen in my pocket, yeah
Louis on my wallet, baby I just made deposit, yeah
So much damn cash I don't know none' 'bout no drugs
So much damn swag get designer on my drugs
Come from Zone 6, I'm the heart, straight out the bricks we been
Handsome, rich, brick on my wrist, bitch on my dick just like I'm Cheen
Dawg I'm so blessed, I know you know draco inside the text
Midget come from Arizona, thirty rounds in that damn mag
Cheese [?], that's freeze on me, hundred racks just on diamonds jack
Any bitch ever get close to me
Don't play baby, don't be tryin' that
Troub' just like a big red dog, call me Clifford
Intelligent, sophisticated, hood like Mr. Clifford
Cam goin' two-hundred, I got the phantom for two-hundred, yeah
Julio good for money, I'm like Julio on these bunnies, yeah
Foreign, yeah, I just was in a hot box
Tryna get it, goin' spot, to spot spot

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Everything we do is in private
Everything we do is private
Everything we do is private
Everything we do is private
