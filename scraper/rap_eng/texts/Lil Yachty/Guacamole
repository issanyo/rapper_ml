[Intro: Nessly & TM88]
Ooh-ooh-ooh (ooh-ooh)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (ooh-ooh)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah (8...)

[Chorus: Nessly]
He said he heard I got it on me (ah)
Bitch, I really got it on me
Don't go playin' with my money
Better pray to someone holy
Thumbin' through this guacamole
Look at all this guacamole
Look at all this guap, it's on me
Don't fuck with my guacamole, yah

[Verse 1: Nessly]
Niggas heard I got the Benz and they right
They always say the truth will come to the light (yah)
Nigga hatin', I'ma cum on his wife (ooh, yeah)
Don't you think I don't know where you reside?
Spent the morning in a cop car
Now a nigga in a flight
Shawty know that I'm a rockstar
She just wanna live the life
Nigga say he sellin' real Act (yah)
Hit the lean up with the light
Hit my liter with the Sprite, ayy (tour)
Put the lean up on the ice (yah)

[Chorus: Nessly & Lil Yachty]
He said he heard I got it on me
Bitch, I really got it on me (ooh)
Don't go playin' with my money (ooh-ooh)
Better pray to someone holy (brr)
Thumbin' through this guacamole (ring, ring)
Look at all this guacamole (yah, ring, ring)
Look at all this guap, it's on me (Lil Boat, ring, ring)
Don't fuck with my guacamole, yah (Lil Boat)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty & Nessly]
He said he heard I was a phony (phony)
Askin' if my jacket stoney (stoney, whoa)
None of my bitches be boney
Nipples big like pepperoni
Most these rappers tryna clone me (clone me)
I remember bein' lonely (yuh)
Now these bitches tryna bone me (bone me, yuh)
Daddy used to stay in Zone 3 (Zone 3)
Ninety thousand on the wedding ring (bling)
But I ain't gettin' married no time soon
Shawty suck me like a vacuum (huh)
Her ass hot like it's the middle June
Look at all this guacamole ('mole)
Sock in her mouth like I'm Mick Foley (I'm Mick Foley)
Guap all in a nigga's pockets
Thighs look like they swollen (Lil Boat)

[Chorus: Nessly & Lil Yachty]
He said he heard I got it on me
Bitch, I really got it on me (ooh)
Don't go playin' with my money (ooh-ooh)
Better pray to someone holy (brr)
Thumbin' through this guacamole (ring, ring)
Look at all this guacamole (ring, ring)
Look at all this guap, it's on me (ring, ring)
Don't fuck with my guacamole, yah
He said he heard I got it on me
Bitch, I really got it on me
Don't go playin' with my money
Better pray to someone holy
Thumbin' through this guacamole
Look at all this guacamole
Look at all this guap, it's on me
Don't fuck with my guacamole, yah
