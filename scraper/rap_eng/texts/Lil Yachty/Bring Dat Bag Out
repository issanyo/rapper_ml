[Intro: Lil Yachty]
So they say like, they say this nigga Comethazine supposed to be like next or something like that. That's what I heard
Okay, okay, I love it
Oh my god, Ronny

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Uh, Uh!
Stack up, stack up
Stick make a nigga back up (yeah!)
SK, AK, shit looking like a racker
Got them white folks say nigga
Got them black folks say cracker
Diamonds dancing, shit looking like Mick Jagger
Ayy ayy, bring that bag out
Ayy, bring that bag out
Ayy ayy, bring that bag out
Niggas clique eat the bullet tip, like it's takeout
Ayy, bring that bag out
Ayy, bring that bag out

[Verse: Comethazine]
Comethazine flex like he Jesus Christ
Bust down on my neck, it cost a check, it shining bright
Run up on a nigga with the choppa, take his life
I just fucked a supermodel, that bitch got me right
I just wanna fuck Demi Lovato, that bitch sexy
Me and Lil Boat pulled up in a coupe, you in a Chevy, aye
Bitch I got a choppa, let my choppa count your blessings
I woke up with gold up on my neck, I woke up flexing, aye
You woke up, was broker than a bitch, you woke up stressin' (uh)
I just bought an extra uzi clip, bitch, I be wreckin'
87 bullets left up in this Mac-11
You ain't with the shit lil' bitch, so quit the fuckin' cappin'  (bitch!)

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Uh!
Stack up, stack up
Stick make a nigga back up (yeah!)
SK, AK, shit looking like a racker
Got them white folks say nigga
Got them black folks say cracker (bitch)
Diamonds dancing, shit looking like Mick Jagger
Ayy ayy, bring that bag out
Ayy, bring that bag out
Ayy ayy, bring that bag out
Niggas clique eat the bullet tip, like it's takeout
Ayy, bring that bag out
Ayy, bring that bag out
