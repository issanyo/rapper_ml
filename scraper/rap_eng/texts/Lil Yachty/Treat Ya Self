[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
It took way too long to stack it up
But it’s way too quick to spend it, I dropped all my revenges
Give a fuck about these bitches, I’m thinkin’ ‘bout the riches
I got mind on the gold, I’m searching for my soul
Goddamn I’m so religious, these niggas so fictitious
Never switched up on my gang, I had to stay the same
All you niggas pussy, all you niggas ain’t real
What’s the deal? Tryna see how I feel
Fuck around, get your block knocked off though
I need my fetti, I need it ASAP like Flacko
Fuckin’ her friend and fuckin’ her then switcharoo
Niggas be hiding like peekaboo
When you get on niggas act like they been with you
Niggas breath shorter than interludes
Pull up that Chevy, that shit sit on 22’s
My new bitch bad, she like Jimmy Choo’s
Can’t love no bitch, no Lil Boat cannot have a boo
I fucked that bitch then I pass her

[Hook: Key! & Lil Yachty]
Yeah
Treat yourself, don’t cheat yourself
Treat yourself, don’t cheat yourself
Treat yourself, don’t cheat yourself
Yeah
Treat yourself, don’t cheat yourself
Treat yourself, don’t cheat yourself
Treat yourself, don’t cheat yourself
Don’t you dare mistreat yourself
Don’t cheat yourself, go get that wealth
Go get it, go get it
Don’t you mistreat yourself
Don’t cheat yourself, go get that wealth
Go get it, go get it

[Verse 2: Key!]
Treat yourself to the finer life
Black girl, white girl, klondike
Left hand, right hand, full of ice
Buy you bitches what you like
AK with the knife for you snitches
Man I hope you die
I just want to treat my mama ‘nem to that finer life
I fucked her [?], designer my pills
Money on my will, new for my [?]
What have you done for me lately?
I swear these bitches is crazy
Wanting me go out my way
Bitch I just want me some face

[Hook: Key! & Lil Yachty]
Yeah
Treat yourself, don’t cheat yourself
Treat yourself, don’t cheat yourself
Treat yourself, don’t cheat yourself
Yeah
Treat yourself, don’t cheat yourself
Treat yourself, don’t cheat yourself
Treat yourself, don’t cheat yourself
Don’t you dare mistreat yourself
Don’t cheat yourself, go get that wealth
Go get it, go get it
Don’t you mistreat yourself
Don’t cheat yourself, go get that wealth
Go get it, go get it
