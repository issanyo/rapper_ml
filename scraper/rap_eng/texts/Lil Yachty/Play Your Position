[Hook: Skippa Da Flippa]
Lately I been countin' front ends
First class flight to go to London
Back then I was the only gunman
Chase the paper like I’m hunting
Better play your position
My favorite room in here the kitchen
I rock presidential like Nixon
Grip the hammer when a nigga start tripping
First go learn your position
Then play your position, play your position
This for the trap niggas
That bag up the eight ball and pass with precision
First go learn your position
Then play your position, play your position
Bake the pot, take it out, I don’t need mittens
Soak up the game, all you gotta do is listen

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Free all my niggas that got caught lackin' on a mission
Lately they been sayin' Boat you trippin'
I been tryna count a hundred plus
Six freak bitches on a tour bus and they all tryna fuck with us
If I pick her out, boy I bet she buss
Dick so good it make her cuss
Chopper my brother, he bust at your mother
Grill in my mouth looking like a lil muffler
Gold on my neck like a bowl full of mustard
Eat on that pussy just like a little custard
I tint my windows when I go see Oscar
These niggas acting, they deserve an Oscar
And she hate Boat because I'm a dog
I'm a lil dog just like a lil boxer
Just know your role and play your position
Diamonds water, look like I been fishing
These niggas be cappin', they really not whipping
Skippa told me you is not in the kitchen
Worry 'bout mines but hold ya own
Old ass nigga, money not even long
Bad bitch walkin' 'round in a thong
I'ma bust it then I send her ass home

[Verse 2: Skippa Da Flippa]
If you's a ho, you's a ho, just play your role
Break the pot, speed it up, stop it, then go
Smoke a blunt, break a bag, kick out the door
I made me a mil 'round the globe
The chopper is only protection, drive the Lam' like a Mexican
Make lil baby suck it in the Masi
While I'm rollin' up, switchin' lanes, textin'
Yeah I got shooters just like Villanova
Triple cup codeine, I don't need a coaster
She talk to a rapper but she told me over and over that she think a young nigga colder
She play a role, she know I don't need her
I'm a player, I'ma kick it like FIFA
Trap RBI higher than Derek Jeter
You follow the Flippa, you follow the leader
Learn your roll and then you play the position
You fuck with the gang then you might end up missing
How many hundreds can you get for a chicken?
I teach you the game if you willing to listen
Flippa!
