[Intro]
Oh, yeah
No you didn't know
808 Mafia

[Verse 1]
The sun shinin', ayy
The sun shinin', got my diamonds blindin', oh yeah
I await all the blessings and grindin', ayy
Don't rush the craft 'cause it's all 'bout timin', ayy
Let's get rich, uh
But when we get rich, gotta stay rich
We gotta double it, invest the guap into some other shit
Some other other shit
Don't spend your money on no other bitch unless you love that bitch

[Chorus]
Come on, my nigga, let's get rich, ayy
Let's get richer than a bitch
We had dreamed about this shit since we was kids, ayy
Come on, my nigga, let's get rich, ayy, ayy
Let's get rich
We gon' be rich forever and ever, we gon' be rich
Let's get rich
We gon' be rich forever and ever, we gon' be rich
Come on, my nigga, let's get rich, ayy, ayy
We gon' be rich forever and ever, we gon' be rich
Let's get rich, ayy, ayy
We gon' be rich forever and ever, we gon' be rich
Come on, my nigga, let's get rich, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2]
Ooh, none of my real niggas switched
That's why I had to keep the game lookin' rich
Ayy my brother didn't have a pot to piss
Now he penthouse sleepin' with his bitch, ayy
With thirty thousand on the wrist
You can do it too, this shit happened to me
And all my blood brothers, man we live by a creed
All in, all win, we all family
Ayy, ooh, since day one
Since day one this music shit been for fun
Ayy, we got blessed with a turn
We got blessed with a ton, a million

[Chorus]
Let's get rich, ayy
Let's get richer than a bitch
We had dreamed about this shit since we was kids, ayy
Come on, my nigga, let's get rich, ayy, ayy
Let's get rich
We gon' be rich forever and ever, we gon' be rich
Let's get rich
We gon' be rich forever and ever, we gon' be rich
Come on, my nigga, let's get rich, ayy, ayy
We gon' be rich forever and ever, we gon' be rich
Let's get rich, ayy, ayy
We gon' be rich forever and ever, we gon' be rich
Come on, my nigga, let's get rich, ayy, ayy

[Verse 3]
We gon' be, yeah, we gon' be, yeah
We gon' be on, we gon' be on
They all try to call your phone when you get on
They try to put you in the wrong when you're doin' right
That means you're doin' right
To get rich you don't need no suit and tie
Follow the dreams you see through the night
Through the night
Through the night

[Chorus]
Let's get rich, ayy
Let's get richer than a bitch
We had dreamed about this shit since we was kids, ayy
Come on, my nigga, let's get rich, ayy, ayy
Let's get rich
We gon' be rich forever and ever, we gon' be rich
Let's get rich
We gon' be rich forever and ever, we gon' be rich
Come on, my nigga, let's get rich, ayy, ayy
We gon' be rich forever and ever, we gon' be rich
Let's get rich, ayy, ayy
We gon' be rich forever and ever, we gon' be rich
Come on, my nigga, let's get rich, ayy, ayy
Forever and ever, ayy, ayy
