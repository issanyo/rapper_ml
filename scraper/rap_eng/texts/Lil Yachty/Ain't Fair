[Intro: Lil Yachty]
I'ma call it clean
Uh Fleacoo you snapped on this beat
Shawty said that I'm a playa, yeah
Shawty said that I'm a playa, yeah
Ok, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Shawty said that I'm a playa
Lil Yachty, I’m the mayor
96 for the M6, catch a nigga in the ballet
Trust me, I know it ain’t fair
Red heads on the scene, counting cream
Rich enough to buy a new spleen
Nutted in your baby mama, now you talking to her like the ho is Billie Jean
You bust your gun in the air
I aim right below your hair
Hollow shells in the nine
Dumped a clip into his spine
Call me Yachty Columbine
Cause I'm out here causing crime
I don't abide by your rhymes

[Verse 2: Nessly]
Bitch I'm with Lil Yachty
You know we looking for the thotties
If a nigga got a problem
We gon' go and shoot his party
Let this gun go retarded
Nigga look at what you started
I don't give no passes, piece on ad-libs, nigga this shit is not [?]
Dan Marino with the plays
Ballin' like I play for the A's
All this cash, got our own maids
My main bitch not even faves
Niggas flossed up, acting bossed up
Ask and they don't spill [?]
If I fuck her got to get some money, nigga that's just the way I was raised
Know that they said it before
I will not play with these hoes
Shawty I need all your dough
Don't make me kick in your door
Shawty be talking too much
I got a dick for her throat
I designer my bridges
I don't designer red bitches

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
I only designer myself
My gang, my brothers, my mama, my belt
Yachty coming for the belt
Lean dark like welts
Green light, we on go
Green dot for my bro
Big dick for your ho
Bitch you know it's Lil Boat
All you lame niggas jokes, I hope ya'll have strokes
You niggas really lame
36 for the chain
38 to his brain
All you lil niggas lame
You know I had to change the game
Bitch it's Yachty, I'm insane
Run it up, we'll take your chain
