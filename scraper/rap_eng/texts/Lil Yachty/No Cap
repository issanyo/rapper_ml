[Verse 1: Thumbz]
Buy a pound just to blow it
Then I buy a pint just to pour it
Porsche truck fully loaded
Spending money like I grow it
The motors come in the rear
40 thousand in my ear
Private flights on a Lear
Broke nigga shop at Sears
My body is flooded with diamonds
VVS’s and they shining
Every brick I get I rerock
Quarter brick left, gotta restock
All my pockets filled with chonnies
Your diamonds looking kind of cloudy
Expensive fabric when I’m hopping out, dabbing
I’m still serving out the Audi
Every brick I get I rerock
Every day I’m buying red bottoms and these niggas still wearing Reeboks
Nigga [?] out, I sold him rerock
The bitch bad, I make her knees knock
If she turn around and have the nerve to ask me for some money
Hold on, bitch please
Told a little bitch freeze

[Hook: Thumbz]
I hop out that bitch and I'm dabbing
Quay told you this shit not a sneeze
Spent ‘bout a mil on some fabric
I got old money in the attic
I got glass pints in the casket
Most you niggas sipping plastic
Niggas in they feelings ‘cause I’m having
Why these niggas so dramatic?
Couple extra grams when I scrape the pot
So I told your auntie she can have it
Most my money from the trap nigga
I ain’t your average rap nigga
You walked up on me in that Audi
AR hit you from the lap nigga
I was a million dollar nigga in the tenth grade
I ain’t even have to cap nigga

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Young nigga thumb through it quicker than a bank teller
Gang deep like the Goodfellas
Thick white bitch look just like a marshmallow
Call my brother Nino and Ferragamo
He got a snake named from Lil Mexicanos
[?] take the hint
Polo dark tint, roll it down and spit
You ain’t making money lazy bitch
Broke no job having nigga
Rather count your baby mama figures
Rather flex on Instagram for pictures
18, fucking on a ho, she like 28 with like two kids
Goddamn nigga, I'm the shit
Pussy nigga get up out your business

[Hook: Thumbz]
I hop out that bitch and I'm dabbing
Quay told you this shit not a sneeze
Spent ‘bout a mil on some fabric
I got old money in the attic
I got glass pints in the casket
Most you niggas sipping plastic
Niggas in they feelings ‘cause I’m having
Why these niggas so dramatic?
Couple extra grams when I scrape the pot
So I told your auntie she can have it
Most my money from the trap nigga
I ain’t your average rap nigga
You walked up on me in that Audi
AR hit you from the lap nigga
I was a million dollar nigga in the tenth grade
I ain’t even have to cap nigga
