[Intro]
30, you a fool for this one
Cheeze

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
Gu-Gucci flip flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock
Pull the 6 out, wintertime, droppin' the top
Give it to that pussy ass, turn the shit up a notch
Gucci flip flops (Fuck it), make it kick rocks (Bust it)
This a big clock, check the wrist watch (Check it)
Gucci flip flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks (Bust it)
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock (Off of the clock)

[Verse 1: Bhad Bhabie]
Bhad Bhabie got these bitches bustin' for cash (Cash)
Do the dash, try to play me, bitch, I'm bustin' yo' ass (Bustin' yo')
Lotta gun sounds, Rollie bust down, know why these bitches mad
'Cause they trash and they fuckin' for cash (Cash)
Too official, blow the whistle, Bitch, I'm fly as a bird (Brr)
Take a picture, get ya' issue, bitch will die on my word (My word)
Walk in the bank, fuck it up, pokin' that bitch with a shank, fuck it up (Fuck it up)
I bought the lil bitch a bag, make it double back and clear up her tab (Yah)

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie & Lil Yachty]
Gu-Gucci flip flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock
Pull the 6 out, wintertime, droppin' the top
Give it to that pussy ass, turn the shit up a notch
Gucci flip flops (Fuck it), make it kick rocks (Bust it)
This a big clock, check the wrist watch (Check it)
Gucci flip flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks (Bust it)
This a big watch (Lil Boat), diamonds drippin' off of the clock (Off of the clock)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I got big guap, pussy, yeah, I'm real rich (Yeah)
6 cars, 2 houses and I'm still rich, uh (Uh)
Think it's sweet? One call, hit the Killswitch (Boom)
Boo, be cool, I ain't worried 'bout yo' lil bitch, nigga
That lil' chain that you rockin', that's so little to me
Talkin' shit, but want a verse? That's a riddle to me
Can't fuck the bitch if she got her virginity (Whoo, yeah)
'Cause then she gon' really be into me (Whoo, yeah)
.223 shots, I might run for the enemies (Ah)
Put a few holes in his kidney (Whoo, Lil Boat)

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
Gu-Gucci flip flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock
Pull the 6 out, wintertime, droppin' the top
Give it to that pussy ass, turn the shit up a notch
Gucci flip flops (Fuck it), make it kick rocks (Bust it)
This a big clock, check the wrist watch (Check it)
Gucci flip flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks (Bust it)
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock (Off of the clock)
