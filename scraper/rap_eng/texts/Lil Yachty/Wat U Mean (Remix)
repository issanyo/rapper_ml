[Intro]
Hey Dae Dae
You know we had to bring this bitch back right, huh?

[Verse 1: Dae Dae]
Back then it was concrete
I remember when they wouldn't stand me
I remember when they doubted me
Now they wanna feature probably
K Blood know you 20 gang, no set trippin' on a crip fool
Jesus blessed me with a gold Rollie and a gold single, I'm a fuckin' fool
Showin' out because you didn't believe me
Showin' out to say I'm a preacher
Glock on me better not reach ya
Props on, give me, me
Dropped on, give me, me
My pops so proud of me
Four shows in a week
Four doors on that jeep
Four marchin' from polices
All this killing going on, I feel like this road ain't safe
Say the fuck? Get out my way
Boulevard ain't safe
Lakewood ain't safe
Eric Street ain't safe
Summerhill ain't safe
Pittsburgh ain't safe
Thought you believed in me
Thought you were my friend but you traded on me
Heard you had them racks, that's your brother's money
Until I came in the game
Everybody dancin', they be like

[Hook 1: Dae Dae]
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Got a family to feed, got a family to feed
They dependin' on me, they dependin' on me
If you don't believe in me
I'm like fuck ya, I'm like fuck ya
Fuck ya

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Racks on my like I'm YC
I'm in Blue Flame with no ID
Got a bad bitch in a two piece
She gon' rip you off like loose leaf
Bitch it's Big Boat (Lil Boat)
Diamond chain like a disco
Got a gang of niggas stayin' 10 toes
And free big Reese out the chain gang with the chicos
Ball like free throw, I'm the Don Dada
All my hipster bitches call me Big Poppa
Shout out Zeus, that's my top shotta
Sold out every show cause I'm a show stopper
I'm the big youngin to these little OG's
I should stuff a nigga in the fuckin' locker
Too positive to tote around a chopper
But my brother and them wonâ€™t hesitate to clock ya, bitch

[Hook 2: Lil Yachty & Dae Dae]
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Got a family in need, I got a family in need
They dependin' on me, they dependin' on me
If you don't believe in me
I'm like fuck ya, I'm like fuck ya
Fuck ya

[Verse 3: Dae Dae]
Thought you believed in me
I thought you had them racks, but you got evicted
Heard you had it on you, you penny pinchin'
'Til I pulled up to get it, to get it, get it
Racks on me like a muhhfucka
(Racks on me, got them racks on me)
I was just broke like a muhhfucka
(I was down bad I ain't had shit)
Racks on me like "WOWWW!"
(Racks on me got, them racks on me)
Fuck niggas like "HOWWW?"
(Fuck niggas like "how?")
How he do that?
Jumped off the porch, I was on the go
Mama couldn't tell me shit, I was trappin' in the fo'
Could you take the pain away?
I gotta make a way a way, way
For my family, yeah

[Hook 1: Dae Dae]
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Got a family to feed, got a family to feed
They dependin' on me, they dependin' on me
If you don't believe in me
I'm like fuck ya, I'm like fuck ya
Fuck ya
