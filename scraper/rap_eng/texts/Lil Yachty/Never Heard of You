[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay, ooh, ay

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Young ass nigga, never heard of you, aye
VVS diamonds in my tennis shoes, aye
Walkin' on that ice, I feel like Happy Feet, aye
Talkin' down, that chopper have a meet and greet

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
New chain cost one fifty
New coupe, inside pink like a sissy
My bitch had to get that weight off, call her Missy
Canary yellow stones in my teeth, they look pissy
Spendin' all this guap got you pissed off
I only got five rings like a missed call
Oh my god, boy, your favourite rapper phoney
He keep tryna tell these niggas that we homies

[Verse 2: Yung Bans]
Why your bitches lowridin', huh, yeen got no bodies
Fuckin' on a bitch, huh, ride the dick in autopilot
Uh, ay, ay, yeah, my baby hot like a tiger
Ay, yeah, ay, fuck a bitch straight out of Follies
Ay, all this damn designer, I'ma mismatch
Yeah, ho all in my face, she need a Tic Tac
Yeah, huh, ridin' with a stick, it got kickback
Ooh, yeah, pussy nigga hatin' 'cause I been had

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Young ass nigga, never heard of you, aye
VVS diamonds in my tennis shoes, aye
Walkin' on that ice, I feel like Happy Feet, aye
Talkin' down, that chopper have a meet and greet

[Verse 3: D Savage]
I just took that nigga bitch, now he pissed off
I be ballin' too damn hard like I'm Chris Paul
Hangin' off the fuckin' rim like I'm John Wall
I be tryna stack my bread, make it stand tall
Bitch, I love to ball, on the cash hunt
Three gram Backwoods smellin' like a skunk
Baby nut go through the back, I'm bomin' through the front
Keep my shooters off a X, this ain't what you want

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Young ass nigga, never heard of you, aye
VVS diamonds in my tennis shoes, aye
Walkin' on that ice, I feel like Happy Feet, aye
Talkin' down, that chopper have a meet and greet

[Outro: D Savage]
D fuckin' Phoenix
