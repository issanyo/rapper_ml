(Verse 1: Lil Yachty)
Stay with the map like apple
Talking that shit, have them come in your chapel
Young nigga fly, I can fly pterodactyl
Got a new bitch with a son, he a rascal
I get the bag from the city, the capital
These niggas fake and Lil Boat be the actual
Beefing online but in person you rational
I do not get it
Making this money, it's making them livid
The shit that you rap bout, you know you don't live it
I got the coupe with the top, you can lift it
I got the coupe with the engine, go drift it
Diamonds they wet like a cup of the mystic
Living this life, so futuristic
Stay optimistic

(Lui$ too Thrill - Hook)
Money signs in the air
That don't even worry me
Jump up on the scene like this shit anarchy
Fuck up the scene, check out the gallery

Money sign money sign money sign
Count up my salary
Smoking on cellary
Only the anarchy
(Woop!)

Charged up, like a battery
On 10 like I'm reading your energy
I am a CHIEF! get struck with the archery
(Woop! Woop!)

You know I'm so ill like a allergy
So lethal I'm cutting through arteries
Killers on me like its anarchy
You know Im a King, watch when I Swing
Anarchy anarchy anarchy!

(Verse 2: Lil Yachty)
(let's go!)
Off the top of the dome
I'm a big boss, Al Capone
Rocking [?] like my name was Jerome
You want the smoke, told the boy to come on
All of the gang members, what's up and I'm on
Fuck with the set, look at my phone
I do not club, that's not what I do
I stay at home and sleep in the stu'
Plotting on ways to build up revenue
Catch me outside on the old avenue
Been a star player, check the attributes
Ben 'bout the guap since I had sessions too
Know they want the boy hung by a noose
Won't catch me lacking, I stay with the truth
Shoot night roofs, and a light handed loops
Shoot, shoot, shoot

(Lui$ too Thrill - Hook)
Money signs in the air
That don't even worry me
Jump up on the scene like this shit anarchy
Fuck up the scene, check out the gallery

Money sign money sign money sign
Count up my salary
Smoking on cellary
Only the anarchy
(Woop!)

Charged up, like a battery
On 10 like I'm reading your energy
I am a CHIEF! get struck with the archery
(Woop! Woop!)

You know I'm so ill like a allergy
So lethal I'm cutting through arteries
Killers on me like its anarchy
You know Im a King, watch when I Swing
Anarchy anarchy anarchy!
