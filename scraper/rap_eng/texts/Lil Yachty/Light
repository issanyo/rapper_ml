[Intro]
Ayy, ayy, what's up gang
Let me go secure the M's for the gang
Ayy, ayy, what's up gang
Those niggas still think it's my fault
Ayy

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
I got that check and took off (took off)
Alot of these niggas look lost (they though)
They broke they think it's my fault (fuck 'em)
Want smoke? We blowin', no cough
I want the bitch, she caught (she through)
I'm drippin', I'm stuck with the sauce (good drip)
Yo bitch be fuckin' me raw (good drip)
But she love you don't cut yo bitch off (yo bitch)
Brand new Givenchy, it's white (that's light)
Limited Louis, that's light (too light)
Wraith in the city, that's light (that's light)
LED, look at the lights (too light)
We the ones niggas don't like (don't like)
But you niggas too light (too light)
Why even play with yo life? (yo, life)
Bank account lookin' like yikes (Bank account lookin' like yikes)

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley]
I went been fillin' out kites, to puttin' an M on my block (scud zone)
New Gucci sweater is drip (that's drip), somebody give me a mop (that's drip)
These niggas act like the cops (like fuzz), gossipin' more than the thots (nigga what?)
In jail I had stripes off the rocks (stripes), I make you count off the rocks (get the fuck on)
These niggas think that I made it and can't get my friends, so they wanna be opps
If I see no niggas who hatin' and I'm in that spaceship, I'm droppin' that top
I get that cake like my b-day, ain't no happy belated, I'm callin' the guap (call it, call it)
Who gave you niggas a voice? Who told you your thoughts count? (what?)
GPS straight to the money, I put my niggas in route
They told me got bricks in the drop, AR with the big Mickey Mouse (Mickey Mouse)
You poses your lady at 12, ain't that nice seein' my dick in her mouth?
Cameras all over the mansion (mansion), you lil niggas can't shit on my house (you dig)

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
I got that check and took off
A lot of these niggas look lost
They broke they think it's my fault (fuck 'em)
Want smoke? We blowing, no cough
I want the bitch, she caught (fuck)
I'm drippin', I'm stuck with the sauce (good drip)
Yo bitch be fuckin' me raw (good drip)
But she love you don't cut yo bitch off (yo bitch)
Brand new Givenchy, it's white (that's light)
Limited Louis, that's light (too light)
Wraith in the city, that's light (that's light)
LED, look at the lights (too light)
We the ones niggas don't like (don't like)
But you lil niggas too light (too light)
Why even play with yo life? (yo, life)
Bank account lookin' like yikes (Bank account lookin' like yikes)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Fuck-fuck with-with me-me boy
Cut off your hands and your fingers, 100 round in your ears with a ringer
Cock it back, watch it turn to a singer, get it fightin' like this Jerry Springer
All of my niggas on go-go, zip the AR back like the pogo
Don't do dirty with these niggas, they popo, had a G Wagon trap turned to rojo
Finally gave it to us in that cold-cold, heard the hoes goin' wild down in SoHo
One's black and the other one's Mexican, had the hoes eatin' dick like El Pollo
Younger than you with a Maybach, younger than you with a Bentley
Fuckin' your bitch from the back, got her head in a pillow, she keep yellin' gently
Ain't being friends with these niggas 'cause when I was down not a soul had sympathy (facts)
That's how I go when you're broke (fact), now a nigga up like a mistletoe
This bitch want Lil Boat to do coke, bitch I'm fucked up on my own
Not get lost on these new niggas clones
Fucked that bitch and she asked for a loan
Had to laught then I told that bitch to get on
Bitch you gon' get that shit on your own
And nobody give me not a thing, so I spend 90K on my ring
You can see all my pain in my watch, got my ex downin' bottles of scotch
Walkin' 'round with my hand on my crotch 'cause I'm poppin' and I know you not
And I know you see just how I'm livin', you not happy with life so you sippin'
Walkin' reeboks on Tree Tops, gettin' hella guap, got a big Benz like Sasquatch
Everytime you see a nigga with a bitch, know it's top notch

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
I got that check and took off
A lot of these niggas look lost
They broke they think it's my fault (fuck 'em)
Want smoke? We blowin', no cough
I want the bitch, she caught
I'm drippin', I'm stuck with the sauce (good drip)
Yo bitch be fuckin' me raw (good drip)
But she love you don't cut yo bitch off (yo bitch)
Brand new Givenchy, it's white (that's light)
Limited Louis, that's light (too light)
Wraith in the city, that's light (that's light)
LED, look at the lights (too light)
We the ones niggas don't like (don't like)
But you niggas too light (too light)
Why even play with yo life? (yo, life)
Bank account lookin' like yikes (Bank account lookin' like yikes)

[Verse 3: Tee Grizzley]
The opps on IG all the time (I see you), I dare them niggas go live (I dare you)
Wagyu steak, I dine (real steak), 8 oz, $255 (real steak)
I can't get funky with niggas, my niggas so groovy, you niggas be jives
If I ain't had love for Meek (Free Meek), I woulda been trying' to get Nicki Minaj (what up Barbie?)
I need a duffle a verse, I do a hook for a dime (a dime)
Promoters on FaceTime before I get to the club, nigga, look at the line
Money ain't changed my heart but I'm smarter, I guess it changed my mind
And I take care of my hitters in prison, don't think it's safe inside (stab his ass)

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]
I got that check and took off (you dig)
A lot of these niggas look lost (you dig)
They broke they think it's my fault (yeah)
Want smoke? We blowin', no cough (no cough)
I want the bitch, she caught
I'm drippin', I'm stuck with the sauce (good drip)
Yo bitch be fuckin' me raw (good drip)
But she love you don't cut yo bitch off (yo bitch)
Brand new Givenchy, it's white (that's light)
Limited Louis, that's light (too light)
Wraith in the city, that's light (you dig)
LED, look at the lights (you dig)
We the ones niggas don't like (don't like)
But you niggas too light (too light)
Why even play with yo life? (you dig)
Bank account lookin' like yikes (Bank account lookin' like yikes)
