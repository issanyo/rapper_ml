[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Don’t act around
Don’t, don’t act around
Don’t act around

[Hook: Cook LaFlare & Lil Yachty]
How you feel?
Start communicating, tell me how you feel
Don’t act around, how you feel
Stop telling to yourself, girl how you feel yeah
I finally woke up to all the models at the club
Just need them to show me love (love, love, love love)
Mixed for life just like a dub (like a dub)
Hey, just need your touch
Ay, it’s just us, yeah (us, us, us us)

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Check my wrist, that shit is fly
I do not go to no clubs
Unless they gon’ pay the dub, dub, dub dub
I stay yellin’ gang and squad
But I’m not from Chi-town
No I am not no Cub, Cub, Cub Cub
You think I’m tryna waste your time
I ain’t tryna waste your time
Girl I’m tryna show you love, love, love love
You be fuckin’ with these dub ass niggas
I’m the richest teen you ever heard of
It’s one of me, it’s a lot of them
This year I feel like I hit me a lottery
Check my closet, it’s a gallery
Icebox, not Mallory’s
I need a check like Vashti
That’s a fashion queen
Who like poppin’ beans
But baby by all means
Let me know

[Hook: Cook LaFlare]
How you feel?
Start communicating, tell me how you feel
How you feel
Stop telling to yourself, girl how you feel yeah
I finally woke up to all the models at the club
Just need them to show me love
Mixed for life just like a dub
Hey, just need your touch
Ay, it’s just us, yeah

[Verse 2: Cook LaFlare]
That’s that shit that I’ve been hating
If you love me how you love me, start communicating
I told you back when we first started dating
I ain’t with the drama baby, hey
No bitch you can’t get no wedding ring, hey
And I’m icy like a hockey rink, hey
I told you once before you can tell me anything
If you stay down I might put you in that foreign thing, hey
It’s like 100 bottles in the club
It’s like 100 models in the club
And I ain’t leaving out with none
Cause it can’t compare to your love
Can’t compare to your touch
But baby girl you’re doing too much
Stop listening to your friends girl, cause they don’t know what’s best for us

[Hook: Cook LaFlare]
How you feel?
Start communicating, tell me how you feel
How you feel
Stop telling to yourself, girl how you feel yeah
I finally woke up to all the models at the club
Just need them to show me love
Mixed for life just like a dub
Hey, just need your touch
Ay, it’s just us, yeah
