[Intro]
I don't pay for shit nigga
Fingers ashy but the diamonds glisten so it evens out
Money greener than some Brussels sprouts
Flip the work I'm like an acrobatic
Pussy nigga know he don't want static
Test Lil Yachty boy its gon' be tragic

[Verse 1]
[?] yea I made magic
Make it happen
Yea I'm happy
Fuck the work up like I'm Charlie Sheen
Want to be Yachty hah in his dreams
I am a real Ben Franklin fiend
In high school I made guap off of the beams
Serving selling like a mad team
I can't cop the Glock unless it got the beam

[Interlude]
Y'all niggas [?] this motherfucker you feel me
Give a fuck what you think, give a fuck what you thought nigga
I just want all my motherfucking bread blue bills you know what I'm saying
I need my blue bills like I was crip or some shit you feel me
I'm 'bout that you feel me
I'm 'bout that bread you feel me
I ain't Jesus I don't got to break bread, this shit mine
I want all that shit

[Verse 2]
My new bitch smell like some cinnamon
K takin xans like they vitamins
All my niggas fuck up the whole fuck up
Never gave a fuck, I'm stuck up
If you broke then shut the fuck up
Lil Yachty I'm next up
All of my niggas be riding
All of my niggas be shot gun robbing for real
Popping like C4
Flyer than g4
I skrt in a two door
You faker than decor
I squat her like deploy
She sucking on the boy
No I'm not a d-boy
But I bring the checks in I get that work in
Make sure my momma not stressing
Make sure my game never resting
We working, working like it's Christmas time at Walmart
Pussy nigga don't get smart
Chopper, chopper pointing at his heart
Better not move nigga
Better be cool nigga
Silly rabbit
Nigga softer than a comfy fabric
Bitch I ball like a fucking Maverick
What's my name
