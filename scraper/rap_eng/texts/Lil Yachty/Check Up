Check up, check up
I just called to check don’t you flex up I mean it
I know you didn’t mean it when you said you were leavin’
So I just let it slide put your feelin’s to the side and vibe
Check up, check up
I just called to check up don’t you flex up I mean it
I know you didn’t mean it when you said you were leavin’
So I just let it slide put your feelin’s to the side and vibe

[Verse]
So many colors in you outfit today
You glow so hard when I seen you on my boulevard or anywhere
I just stop and stare, I can’t help it my bad
But you look so good, that I wish that I could Oh Lord
One time, just one time
Let me get a chance just to be your man
Show you everything that I had planned
It'd be so nice, for you, love everything Oh Lord
From your head to your toes, so much beauty gets exposed
Every picture every pose you're a queen I swear
You're a queen I swear, so delicate and rare Oh Lord
Ooohhh, so beautiful, you are so beautiful
Can’t nobody say otherwise
Oh, no, no, no, no

[Outro]
Ooh sunny skies and mellow highs
And long walks in the park with french fries with no goodbyes
And I wanna lay you down and sing every single lullaby
Ohh its something that you do to me
I can’t, I can’t explain I need to put her, put her in the scoot with me
Because everything that she do to me she does to me
And she makes me feel so so good
She makes me feel so so good
So good that I feel wrong and I feel bad
But I feel right soo right, so right
Oh, check up
Oh, oh, oh, check up

Sunny skies
