[Verse 1]
I put diamonds on my necklace
I just had a bitch eat my dick up for breakfast
I'm on now
I got all these bitches and in my phone now
All I do is call and they come then they cum
Cause I'm on now
Cause I'm on now, yeah, aye
All these niggas tryna call my phone but don't call me
Aye, yeah, woah, aye, yeah

[Hook]
I don't fuck with niggas
I don't fuck with niggas
I don't fuck with niggas
I don't fuck with niggas

I don't fuck with, I don't fuck with, I don't fuck with niggas
I don't fuck with niggas
I don't fuck with niggas

[Verse 2]
I don't fuck with niggas
That's why I buck on niggas
And I'm stuck with mine
It's my time to shine damn, I might fuck your bitch
Watch me lane switch
Pull up in that Beamer
Aye, I keep that steam in case a nigga try me
Call me Dej Loaf
Bitch I'm Lil Boat
They call me the GOAT, damn
Give your bitch a stroke
All these niggas jokes
Cause I don't fuck with niggas
I don't fuck with niggas

[Hook]
I don't fuck with niggas
