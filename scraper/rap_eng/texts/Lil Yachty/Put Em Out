[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I'm that nigga bitch, got your main hoe rollin' my swishers
Bitches love Yachty, stackin' paper up so I can buy my stack
Anthrax got my trunt beatin' in my jeans, scratch
I'm too fly, rollin' up this purp got me too high
Double dippin' any bitch I want, them walk it out like I'm D.j Unk
Pull the 9 out and let 'em have it, pillow talkin' niggas swear they faggots
Talkin' 'bout you movin', blowin', countin' guap, boy, your ass cheaper than coin star
Talkin' 'bout you got the xans with the lean need to wake up from the dream
How many times I done told you before that I'm up next?
RD gettin' way too hot, RD gettin' too reckless
I can tell that he fu from the looks of his necklace
Niggas mad cause I'm stackin' guap
Fuck her friend straight for days
Fuck your hand out I got my ways, seein' goofy niggas like an xray
Hangin' out the window with the AK, this the new trap for the fly niggas
They like any of my ride or die nigga, I don't fuck with you that's on god nigga
And if you talkin' down he can catch hollowtips straight to the side nigga
Got the block hot, trail blazer, lemme show you 'round the whole trap baby
Pots and pans near the scale baby, rollin' up a whole 12 baby
I can't fuck with 12 baby, I really been stackin' up lately
Got a white bitch, look like Joseph lately , got the brown whip like a bowl of gravy
I'm a hot boy, these hoes crazy, I could never ever trust 'em

[Verse 2: K$preme]
(I cannot trust 'em)
Stick'em six feet below the ground, nigga better not make a sound
(?), but I still knew the pound
Ballin' soo hard I'm on NBA Bound
(?) now his body can't be found, your shoes drippin' you might fuckin' drown
Servin' pints all around the town, bitch I'm drippin' and dabbin', and right then I'm in the wax
Smokin' thrax, sellin' thrax, pull it out my hat like a magician
I could write you a prescription, lemme stop givin' these niggas descriptions
I make music for the young and dumb, lean in my cup got my body numb
And my blunts fatter than a swollen thumb, damn, I do not drink rum, this purple
Got me geekin' like Steve Urkle, got your bitch out past her curfew
100 pack shawty, now I'm a walkin' lift, and (?) whip the brick
(?) got the whip
Do not try to run cause I got a stick, doggin' niggas just like like Michel Vick
Whippin' soo hard, done sprained my wrist, finessin' soo hard I can't call it quits
