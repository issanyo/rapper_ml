[Intro: Cook LaFlare & HoodrichKeem]
Me and D-Money want millions
(HoodrichKeem, yeah, I'm thinkin' 'bout signing that guy)

[Hook: Cook LaFlare]
Hoop dreams, nigga, it's not real as it seem
They treat me like a king, still wrap them birds in Vaseline
See me at Panic, fish like Atlantis
Tools like mechanics, niggas' bitches like Ellen
They tellin', pop at your melon, I'm still sellin'

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Whoa, ah, whoa
I ain't know what I wanted to be when I grew up
But I growed up and all my money flew up
My bitch got melons, all my big brothers felons
It ain't no tellin' what they goin' to do if you talkin'
I'm a rich-walkin', Valet-parkin', shit-startin' young nigga
I'm a bitch-fuckin', semi-tuckin', never-duckin', never-stuntin' young nigga

[Hook: Cook LaFlare]
Hoop dreams, nigga, it's not real as it seem
They treat me like a king, still wrap them birds in Vaseline
See me at Panic, fish like Atlantis
Tools like mechanics, niggas' bitches like Ellen
They tellin', pop at your melon, I'm still sellin'

[Verse 2: Cook LaFlare]
All my ex-hoes want me neutered
Juggin' off of Elm Street, I'm Freddy Kreuger
All my cousins crooks and shooters
I run with bands like Van Cougar
Poison like ivy, crazy like Miley
Move white like Kylie, my niggas locked up for bodies
They never callin' home
R.I.P. my niggas dead and gone

[Hook: Cook LaFlare]
Hoop dreams, nigga, it's not real as it seem
They treat me like a king, still wrap them birds in Vaseline
See me in Panic, fish like Atlantis
Tools like mechanics, niggas' bitches like Ellen
They tellin', pop at your melon, I'm still sellin'
