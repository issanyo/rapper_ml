[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Yah (Meltycanon)
It's Lil Boat
What's up Father?
Yah, yah

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Oh shit, we just got it lit like a candle
And I'm always one toe in, one toe out like sandals
And I'm 'bout my Green Bay like that nigga Randall
And I'm, mad rare like a purple Lambo
Gee, sheesh, I feel like Rambo, goddamn Daniel
I get paid daily what niggas get paid annual
And I'm still on the rise like a college player
She suck more bloods than a whole vampire lair
Runnin' shit, runnin' shit just like the mayor
Fuck your clique, and fuck every nigga you brought here
My neck is sick, got me flexin' like I'm Ric Flair
I don't want your bitch, but if I did, nigga she'd be here

[Verse 2: Father]
Still fake as fuck I'm photoshoped
They be slobbin' I'm Heartthrob
Calabasas to East Coast
Grab yo' ass and eat it up
Grab yo' ass and beat him up
Run his pockets, count it up
Roll up doja on her butt
Girl don't get too caught up
On a nigga like me yeh, or a nigga like Boat, eh
Girl look at this coat, yah
It ain't even that cold, no
Middle of summer, in some ice and some furs
Bitches know Father
I ain't never been curved
Still got the Motorola, yah
Keep good dope on me, yah
I don't fuck with these phonies, no
Stop calling me homie, hoe
Spanish girls like te amo
You got ana', I got ammo
Hit 'em upo like black rambo
Melty playing on piano
Lean'd up my Act yo'
Still love that Act though
Still a fucking asshole
Fuck her in her asshole
Valentino chain on
Her neck she tatt' my name on
Money and the fame, huh
She like boy don't change on me
