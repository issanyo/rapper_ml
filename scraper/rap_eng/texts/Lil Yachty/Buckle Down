[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Byou, what’s up boy?
I said
I said these hoes think that we doin’ shit now
I told that bitch, I said to that bitch
I said, “Bitch, if you think that we going fast now bitch”
Bitch if you think that we doin’ some shit now bitch
Just give me a couple months bitch
I told that bitch to buckle down, you feel me?
Aight, Byou I said that bitch buckle down

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Buckle, down, buckle, down
Buckle, down, buckle, down
Buckle down stupid bitch
Buckle down stupid bitch
Buckle, down, buckle, down
Buckle, down, buckle, down
Buckle, down, buckle, down
Buckle, down, buckle, down

[Verse 1: Byou]
I talk money, that’s buck teeth
If money talk, you keep it brief
Pot head, Johnny Appleseed
I hit her once just like the weed
These boys seven days
They so week
Got tall freak, that’s a tall ho
Like a new truck if I pull up
If I hop down you might break a leg
Nigga good luck
Even if she dyslexic, she still gon’ sick my duck
Even if I’m upset, I still might just set you up
It’s Byou, not bayou
But if I’m by you I’ll wet you up
Yachty tape, ain’t shut you up?
Duct tape gon’ shut you up
Yellow tape and red tape
I’m gon’ beat the case, so set it up
Can’t even rap about a song, just wrap it up
Duely truck, tooly mounted up

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Buckle, down, buckle, down
Buckle, down, buckle, down
Buckle down stupid bitch
Buckle down stupid bitch
Buckle, down, buckle, down
Buckle, down, buckle, down
Buckle, down, buckle, down
Buckle, down, buckle, down

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Triple, double, new A’s, rebel
Double, stuffed, feeling, she gobble
It’s Boat
If my name ain’t comin’ out your throat that’s a fine
Yeah, old hundreds like wine
Don’t even waste your time
Bitch think that I’m doing good
Wait ‘til the ho see me next month
I’ma hit her with the next stunt
Coupe color like fruit punch
Coupe color like fruit punch

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Buckle, down, buckle, down
Buckle, down, buckle, down
Buckle down stupid bitch
Buckle down stupid bitch
Buckle, down, buckle, down
Buckle, down, buckle, down
Buckle, down, buckle, down
Buckle, down, buckle, down
