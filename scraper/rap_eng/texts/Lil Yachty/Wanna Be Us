[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Bitch you know it's Lil Boat
Bitch it's Lil Boat and Lil Perry
I keep them hoes like a ferry
My hair be red like a cherry
All of them niggas they know
All of them niggas they know me
All of them niggas they know us
Them niggas they wanna be us, damn
Bitch you know it's Lil Boat
Bitch it's Lil Boat and Lil Perry
I keep them hoes like a ferry
My hair be red like a cherry
All of them niggas they know
All of them niggas they know me
All of them niggas they know us
Them niggas they wanna be us

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Shoutout to my nigga Colby
Gold on my neck like a trophy
Lil Boat powered up like a Mophie
Lil Boat that nigga stay low-key
All of these bitches they know me
All of these bitches they on me
That bitch she smile like emoji
That bitch she smile like emoji (woah damn)
I be posted up with Perry
I be counting up the guap
Keep a condom in my sock
Cause these bitches on my cock
I need a mouth full of rocks
And I need me a Rollie
Need a mansion for my brodies
Need my diamonds to be dancin'

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Bitch you know it's Lil Boat
Bitch it's Lil Boat and Lil Perry
I keep them hoes like a ferry
My hair be red like a cherry
All of them niggas they know
All of them niggas they know me
All of them niggas they know us
Them niggas they wanna be us, damn
Bitch you know it's Lil Boat
Bitch it's Lil Boat and Lil Perry
I keep them hoes like a ferry
My hair be red like a cherry
All of them niggas they know
All of them niggas they know me
All of them niggas they know us
Them niggas they wanna be us

[Verse 2: Burberry Perry]
All of these niggas they know
I need my bitch like a Reeses
Got yo bitch wet like the Ganges
Walkin' on water like Jesus
Bitches they changin' like seasons
I need like five for my leases
I got ice on my wrist
Whipping the work like a Prius
None of these niggas can see us
I'm up in the Himalayas
Bitches they trying to lay us
I hit that bitch then I lay up
Put it in like a finger roll
Hit that bitch and then I 'troll
Can't have one bitch I need like four
They scream my name at the shows

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Bitch you know it's Lil Boat
Bitch it's Lil Boat and Lil Perry
I keep them hoes like a fairy
My hair be red like a cherry
All of them niggas they know
All of them niggas they know me
All of them niggas they know us
Them niggas they wanna be us, damn
Bitch you know it's Lil Boat
Bitch it's Lil Boat and Lil Perry
I keep them hoes like a ferry
My hair be red like a cherry
All of them niggas they know
All of them niggas they know me
All of them niggas they know us
Them niggas they wanna be us
