[Verse 1: Key!]
I got a thing for new hoes
I got a thing for new money
Kick 'em out, get some new money
Stranger danger, you never knew money
Hit the club and throw loose money
No ones, just new hundreds
Found a bitch that I like
Threw her one and then two hundreds
I feel like Draymond Green in the fourth
I stuff a life sentence in the door
If I see a bowl I grab a fork
And whip that motherfucker like a sport
I threw- I threw Y-3 on, I love my tags
I’m a motherfucker like my dad
I been wanting money since a lad
You ain’t get no money, that’s your bad

[Hook: Lil Yachty] X2
That’s your bad, pussy nigga that’s your bad
You niggas sad, y’all ain’t really counting cash
Oh that’s your bag, I took that bag, oh shit my bad
Oh that’s your bad, pussy nigga that’s your bad

[Verse 2: Key!]
You snooze, you lose
We up, white bars
Green bars, school bus
Who broke, they broke
Not us, G stars
Seams on my jeans from the bud
Pull up with my team, finna bust
Pull out and I nutted on her butt
Call my partner when I need some lean though
Bitch I’m shooting like a fucking phenom
Raw denim, suck my dick with my jeans on
Pussy ass nigga, this your theme song
Fuck niggas love to chatter
Brought my original bowl like I’m whipping some batter
We so fucking up like we climbed a ladder
Fucked her like I want her but she really don’t matter

[Hook: Lil Yachty] x2
That’s your bad, pussy nigga that’s your bad
You niggas sad, y’all ain’t really counting cash
Oh that’s your bag, I took that bag, oh shit my bad
Oh that’s your bad, pussy nigga that’s your bad

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
That’s your bad, pussy nigga that’s your bad
