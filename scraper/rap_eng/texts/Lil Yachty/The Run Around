[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I been flexing since the '90s
Got a bad bitch, she grind me
All my bitches acting fancy
That boy right there, that’s my shooter
I nickname him Tom Clancy
I got bitches in the hills
I got bitches in the hood
I got niggas in Decatur
It might be your next door neighbor
I’m tired of doing niggas favors
I can’t fuck with all you haters
Lowkey I might run for mayor
Lowkey I could be a Laker
I been ballin’ like a Pacer
I think that’s my only chaser
I be iced out, water
I be looking like a crystal
Lil yachty on a mission
Rich gang, going fishing
Look at this, this snakeskin
I got bitches they can fuck me
I can take all your main hoes
Nigga wanna shoot the one now
‘Cause I just fucked on his main ho
Uh, damn, let’s get it poppin’ like Crisco
All these blond head faggot niggas
Running ‘round like Cisco
Huh, damn, ain’t nobody tryna fuck with me
Lil Yachty, I’m a buck fifty
Money tall like project building
Platinum teeth, and mountain silver villains
Beam on him, he look like Krillin
I be aiming at a nigga head
Lil Yachty want these niggas dead

[Verse 2: JBan$]
I been flexin' since the 90’s
VVS’s in my timepiece
Only fucking on a dime piece
Supreme tee, number 9 jeans
Catch me riding out of town
Chopper hold a hundred rounds
24 karat gang
JBan$, I’m the one to blame
Sippin’ Act make the pain go away
Fuck these niggas, they lame anyway
Fuck on they main bitch every day
Smoking swishers makes me go insane
[?] out with the candy paint
Aretha Franklin, my chopper gon’ sang
Aretha, my chopper gon bang
JBan$

[Verse 3: Nessly]
1500 on a pair of sneakers
Why the fuck would I sneak diss?
Niggas running with the swag
I don’t cease and desist
Yachty in the back running booth
Like a CD disc
25 for my fucking arm
Got me on Sprite remix
Free Quanny my brother
Now he locked up on murder
Won’t drop that lames on my brothers
Pussy be locked up for murder
You should just know that they shootin’
Home invasion intrusion
He shootin’, I’m shootin’, we shootin’
Codeine in my fluids
