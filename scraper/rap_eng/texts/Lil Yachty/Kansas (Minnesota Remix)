[Hook: OGMatthew]
You need to stay  out of Kansas if you can't take the heat
You need to stay  out of Kansas if you can't take the heat
Yea its super flat in Kansas, super flat in Kansas
Super flat in Kansas, super flat in Kansas
Need to stay out of Kansas if you can't take the heat
You need to stay out of Kansas if you can't take the heat
Cause it is super flat in Kansas, super flat in Kansas
Super flat in Kansas, it is super flat in Kansas
Need to stay out of Kansas if you can't take the heat
You need to stay out of Kansas if you can't take the heat

[Verse 1: OGMatthew]
Cause it is super flat in Kansas, ain't no hills up here
Nothin' sittin up, not even my rap career
I was eatin' emperors with a girl from Colorado
Said its really rocky there, and here its really shallow
I don't have gold i have coal, yea its pretty lame
Now my bars are fire, all these rappers sound the same
I've been flexin' since i was four, got racks in my sock drawer
I'm from Wichita not K.C., I rock newbies like I'm beastly
My phone banging off the walls, Gucci on my drawers
I don't go into these streets because i'm scared of the drug wars
I was Finessin' on your sister, she was callin' me her mister
She said pose for a picture, i said no no i'm not your mister
I was playing all these tracks, countin' up them racks
School is my lifetime sentence, but debate is fun, true that
Wren, that's my teacher, he taught me about debate
A high five for that boy, he took care of the boy
