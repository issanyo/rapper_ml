[Verse 1:]
9 times outta 10, I get what I want
But you making it hard for me
You should put your guard down for me
Let me make your life a little bit sweeter
I wanna meet her
Ooooh, promise that I'll treat you right
Exceptions just for you, you get more than 1Night
Oooh, you get more than 1Night, you get my life
Oh love, whole life, our life, my love
Hoe fly as a dove, these nigga's dubs
Tattoo on your ass cheek, you fine as fuck
I need your love, all of my love
Oh love, all love, I need your love
Oh love

[Verse 2:]
There's something about you
So special I don't know what it is
It's Boat from the Six
Come fuck with me, come have my kids
Stop playing, oh, my love, stop playing
Niggas fuck with you, I'ma get to spraying
Put my right hand on the bible, my love for you is undeniable
My story's unwriteable, it's true, true for you

[Outro]
Oh love
Oh love, I need your love
Oh love, All of my love
Oh love
Oh love, I need your love
Oh love
