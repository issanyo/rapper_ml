[Hook: Reese & Lil Yachty]
I’m so high, I’m swervin’ through it
Higher than the clouds, I’m soarin’ through ‘em
Ran up a check, don’t do it to ‘em
I might flex up on you, do it to ‘em
Pull up in a Beamer, got me shittin’ on your Buick
Stuntin’, flexin’, ballin’, I might have to do it to you
All these niggas broke, all these niggas pocket watchers
All these niggas broke, all these niggas pocket watchers
I might have to do it to you

[Verse 1: Reese]
Married to the shit, but it’s holy matrimony
Ice on my neck got me looking like a faucet
I’m a walking check, see those honchos when I’m talking
Keep that thing 100 times 10, I’m one thousand
Saint Laurent my wardrobe, call it YSL sliming
Brother say he got a play, you know that Reese’ll slide in
You know this
I see you girl, you know I notice
Pull up on ‘em like skrt skrt
Sorry that I had to do it to you
Oh yeah, know I do it do it
Yeah, know I do it do it

[Hook: Reese]
I’m so high, I’m swervin’ through it
Higher than the clouds, I’m swimmin’ through ‘em
Ran up a check, don’t do it to ‘em
I might flex up on you, do it to ‘em

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I don’t even smoke but my clout in the clouds
Got it out the gutter like Buddy from 8 Mile
See you niggas watching, see you running through my files
Finna cop the crib with the white and black Versace towel
I’ma have ‘em like "wow"
How many niggas you know flex ball this quick?
All these niggas on my dick, pause
All these bitches want me ‘cause they know I'm next nigga
Ice real sick, candy-coated covered wrist
Lookin’ like a hundred licks
Ballin’ like a Knick
Call up Ollie, he keep sticks
If a nigga think he slick

[Hook: Reese & Lil Yachty]
I’m so high, I’m swervin’ through it
Higher than the clouds, I’m swimmin’ through ‘em
Ran up a check, don’t do it to ‘em
I might flex up on you, do it to ‘em
Pull up in a Beamer, got me shittin’ on your Buick
Stuntin’, flexin’, ballin’, I might have to do it to you
All these niggas broke, all these niggas pocket watchers
All these niggas broke, all these niggas pocket watchers
I might have to do it to you
