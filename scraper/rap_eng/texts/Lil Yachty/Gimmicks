I never cared 'bout no image
All these rappers they gimmicks
All these bitches some bitches
And all these niggas they snitches
I never cared 'bout no image
All these rappers they gimmicks
All these bitches some bitches
And all these niggas they snitches
The money the only reason why I'm in it
Nigga out here tryna dodge a life sentence
Nigga out here tryna dodge all these bullets
The money the only reason why I'm in it
Ya get it?

[Verse 1: Jose Guapo]
Ferragamo on my garments that's just how I'm livin'
In these streets it ain't safe, I'm out here dodgin' bullets
Nigga prayin' on my downfall, donâ€™t want me winning
I had to pop a perc just to stay alert
I can't fuck with none of these niggas cause these niggas shiesty
Nigga plottin' on the crap game, we shootin' ice
Yeah I'm swervin' in the foreign that without no licences
I'm with Yachty mix that soda like we fuckin' vikings
We in LA on some shit that we ain't ever trap
I'm higher than a motherfucka and I ain't gotta lie
I might put your hoe on molly and she might just cry
Flyer than a motherfucka, never wore a tie

[Hook: Jose Guapo]
I never cared 'bout no image
All these rappers they gimmicks
All these bitches some bitches
And all these niggas they snitches
I never cared 'bout no image
All these rappers they gimmicks
All these bitches some bitches
And all these niggas they snitches
The money the only reason why I'm in it
Nigga out here tryna dodge a life sentence
Nigga out here tryna dodge all these bullets
The money the only reason why I'm in it
Ya get it?

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I don't fuck with niggas cause these niggas shiesty
I don't fuck with bitches cause these bitches pricey
If I was you, I'd be just like you, I wouldn't like me
Stuntin' soo damn hard make a pussy nigga wanna fight me, whoa
Guapo and Boat, stay heavy float
Keep every bitch on a scope, if he ain't know, now he know, yeah
I ain't talkin' no disrespect from no nigga not a hoe nigga
Some of my niggas might shoot you out shit, that's how it goes nigga
I stay on my own, meet not a nigga, I keep it alone
These niggas some clones, broke ass nigga keepin' with the joans
Don't call my phone, if you ain't talkin' money, speak after the tone
Top dog Al Capone, real diamond stones, oooh
