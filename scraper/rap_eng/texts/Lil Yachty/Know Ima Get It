[Intro: Lil Duke]
It's ya boy, Lil Duke
I got Lil Boat with me, Lil Boat
Lil Yachty what up, Lil Boat
No clock but it's our time now
Broke niggas stand down now

[Hook: Lil Duke & Lil Yachty]
I know I'mma get it fasho
I'm upping my price for my shows
Prices get cheaper, coming off the boat
I just had a threesome at the [?]
They screaming, they asking for Lil Duke and Lil Boat
Chasing my dreams, I'm not chasing these hoes
Pick up a pistol, erasing these hoes
Smoke a whole blunt to the face on these hoes
I count all my digits
All of these niggas is bitches, I do not trust 'em
All of these niggas be switching, I do not switch up
I call my bro to get the package picked up
They say you changed when you can't change
That's funny man
Broke ass nigga hating from the side
Mad cause I pulled off in Rover Range

[Verse 1: Lil Duke]
It's my time to shine now
Nothing but them dimes when we laying around now
I ain't looked up at the clock but it's our time now
Can't save these bitches, we gon' let 'em drown
They talking 'bout me, I'm the talk of the town
I ain't Yung Joc but it's goin' down
B's on the stick like the nose on a clown
Nigga we vibing, keep twenty hoes 'round
Don't step in the way, they gon' gun that boy down
Stay out the way and just pray and stay down
Chasing my dreams, trying to make momma proud
Did a tour with Thugga, made a hunnid thousand

[Hook: Lil Duke & Lil Yachty]
I know I'mma get it fasho
I'm upping my price for my shows
Prices get cheaper, coming off the boat
I just had a threesome at the [?]
They screaming, they asking for Lil Duke and Lil Boat
Chasing my dreams, I'm not chasing these hoes
Pick up a pistol, erasing these hoes
Smoke a whole blunt to the face on these hoes
I count all my digits
All of these niggas is bitches, I do not trust 'em
All of these niggas be switching, I do not switch up
I call my bro to get the package picked up
They say you changed when you can't change
That's funny man
Broke ass nigga hating from the side
Mad cause I pulled off in Rover Range

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Who said I was broke, broke, broke, broke, broke, broke, broke
Boy you know that's a lie
YSL on my side
Lil Boat down to ride
We threw twenty thousand in the sky
Just to watch 'em go down
Rainbow diamonds like a Teletubby
Bet that all of these bitches love me
Flexed up in a new Benz with a pair of twins and they all in
Fuck nigga tried to hide from us, so we got his key in
Red dot pointed at his chin, bet the pussy nigga pay me then
But why they be hating?
Why they be hating on a young nigga?
Prolly cause I'm banging
These knucklehead broke ass niggas need a spanking
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Fuck all these niggas
I don't count my figures
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em

[Hook: Lil Duke & Lil Yachty]

All of these niggas be switching, I do not switch up

That's funny man
Broke ass nigga hating from the side
