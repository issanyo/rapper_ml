[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Ridin' real deep, pussy nigga, and I'm too good
AK, no carbon fiber, bitch real wood
Know some young niggas, turned rich and is still hood
Hop out the whip, get a glimpse of my new bitch
White X6 M with a boost kit
Playin' wit' the guap, that'll get your ends split
Used to be broke, eatin' jelly sandwich with the crust cut off
Pump with the sawed-off

[Chorus]
Niggas around me go commando, yeah
Boat and two hoes in a Lambo, yeah (uh!)
Paint on the face like Rambo, yeah
Tell me a place that I can't go, yeah
Bitch tell your friend, "Step it up" (whoo)
Ain't no raw, bitch, we gon' wrap it up (no)
Pole game, tryna run it up (yeah)
Lock safe like a Brink's truck (huh)
Fuck wit' me, fuck wit' me, fuck wit' me, yeah
Yo' bitch, she just wanna fuck on me, (whoo)
Clip on the hip like it's stuck on me, yeah
It could get ugly, yeah (ooh)
Ridin' 'round town, drop top wit' your sister
Make her suck dick 'til her lip get a blister
Send her back home so your bitch ass could kiss her
Young nigga ball like a Sixer (bitch)

[Verse 2]
Young ass nigga, I don't even drink liquor
I don't even pull up to the mixer (nah)
I don't even want to fuck the vixen (huh)
I do, but I know she gon' tell (huh)
Hit from the back, her chain hit the headboard (ding)
It sound like a bell (bitch)
Pussy nigga I repel, real niggas don't take Ls
Hop in the Bentley, the Maybach, the G-Wagon, nigga whatever (yeah)
Glockety tucked in the sweater, Osiris gon' pop it wherever (yeah)
Pellz gon' pop it wherever, Lil Baby gon' pop it wherever
Stay out the mix, stay wit' a bitch in the whip (skrr)
Hellcat hit a flip (skrr), up it up wit' a chip (skrr skrr)
Bitch nigga don't you send for me (nah) unless the check got an M for me (yeah)
Write it out to my industry (yeah), the bitch lace front incomplete
These niggas loco, hang wit' the cops, you McFogell
Bitch nigga I am a mogul

[Chorus]
Niggas around me go commando, yeah
Ballin' two hoes in a Lambo, yeah (uh!)
Paint on the face like Rambo, yeah
Tell me a place that I can't go, yeah
Bitch tell your friend, "Step it up" (whoo)
Ain't no raw, bitch, we gon' wrap it up (no)
Pole game, tryna run it up (yeah)
Lock safe like a Brink's truck (huh)
Fuck wit' me, fuck wit' me, fuck wit' me, yeah
Yo' bitch, she just wanna fuck on me, (whoo)
Clip on the hip like it's stuck on me, yeah
It could get ugly, yeah (ooh)
Ridin' 'round town, drop top wit' your sister
Make her suck dick 'til her lip get a blister
Send her back home so your bitch ass could kiss her
Young nigga ball like a Sixer (run it up)

[Outro]
Run it up
Pussy
Yeah
Whoo!
