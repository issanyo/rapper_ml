[Verse 1]
Max out in the day, sleep late
Then we wake up earlier than brokers
We’re the worst victims of today, we’ve been trapped by your mistakes

We have Bad Lungz like the Trump family, the sick and the smokers
So I promise when I’m older
They will all know your name
It will never be the same

[Pre Chorus]
Me and my friends go harder than the pain we feel
We lit We lit We lit
Me and my friends are fresher than a Range four wheel
Cause we lit we we lit

[Chorus]
We buzzin
And I love em
They’re my day ones
Chat mess, say what
They’d never leave me on my own – they’re loyal
Not like them fakes, trust me they won’t stick up for you

[Verse 2]
Stroll by the coast there’s a new wave
She don’t wanna be saved - don’t save her
OVO Sound it’s a new fave
Forget the people cuz they’ve

Destructed the power we gave to them
Traded in family for useless friends
Homeland in our hearts, yeah we rep our ends
Don’t you try and pretend

[Pre Chorus 2]
Like you’re one of us
You ain't one of us
Cuz unlike you we
Unlike you we

[Chorus]
We buzzin
And I love em
They’re my day ones
Chat mess, say what
They’d never leave me on my own – they’re loyal
Not like them fakes, trust me they won’t stick up for you

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR + *Lil Yachty*]
I still run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
You never stuntin' 'til you met a nigga like me
Don't you disagree, I gave you everything you need
I run through a hundred pack with you baby, baby

[Outro]
I curate good vibes
Tell em don’t waste my time
You can’t steal my vibes
You can’t steal my vibes
