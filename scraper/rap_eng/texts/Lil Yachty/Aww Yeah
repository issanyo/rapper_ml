[Intro: A$AP Ferg & Lil Yachty]
Yeah, shhhhh
Bow your head
I'm a Trap Lord again
It's the Trap Lord, Hood Pope and Lil Boat nigga
Don't like that nigga, ain't happenin'
You can suck on my dick nigga, fuck 'em
Yeah

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Diamonds shining everywhere, aw yea
Big ol' booty in the air, aw yea
Diamonds in my Cartier, aw yea
Ferg and Yachty in the Lear, aw yea
Diamonds shining everywhere, aw yea
Big ol booty in the air, aw yea
Diamonds in my Cartier, aw yea
Ferg and Yachty in the Lear, aw yea

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
This what it sound like when doves cry
Traplord in the building like yeah, right!
Fucking on a bad model bitch
And I bought her the Prada and Fendi like yeah, right!
In the Ferrari with Yachty
We just left the party, we hop in the Lear
In the PJ with a couple bad bitches
And they touching my Cartiers
Damn and I never had a bitch pop a pussy like this
That's a bad bitch right there
Poppin' the bottles of the Cris, you don't think I'm the shit
You niggas is some haters
Aw man look at the glist' on a wrist
Look like I had it in refrigerator
Had your bitch put a good kiss on a dick
And she know that's my my spot right there

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Diamonds shining everywhere, aw yea
Big ol' booty in the air, aw yea
Diamonds in my Cartier, aw yea
Ferg and Yachty in the Lear, aw yea
Diamonds shining everywhere, aw yea
Big ol booty in the air, aw yea
Diamonds in my Cartier, aw yea
Ferg and Yachty in the Lear, aw yea

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Living out my dreams, I live movie scenes
Nothing's what it seems, thirty to my seams
I'm with the Hood Pope, we like finer things
Bad Australian bitches in designer jeans
Mister typhoon, trapping Cancun, diamonds full moon
You's a whole coon, I can't wait for June
Drop the top on that new zoom zoom
I'm a young nigga, nineteen, I can be your mama's son
Fuck your mama's son
Collar Gang and that's when the drama come

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Diamonds shining everywhere, aw yea
Big ol' booty in the air, aw yea
Diamonds in my Cartier, aw yea
Ferg and Yachty in the Lear, aw yea
Diamonds shining everywhere, aw yea
Big ol booty in the air, aw yea
Diamonds in my Cartier, aw yea
Ferg and Yachty in the Lear, aw yea
