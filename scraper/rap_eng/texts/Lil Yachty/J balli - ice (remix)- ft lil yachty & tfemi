Got my bitch and I screw her like a lug nut
If she cold then I fuck her up to warm her up
Got some liqour and a old lighter, roll it up
Still she bad and she bout it, so we turnin' up
In the crib, smell that pineapple, we burnin' up
Grabbed the bottle, popped a cap, watch me pour it up
I'm sippin' Henny and she sippin' on the vodka
We mess it up, now we feelin' like some rockstars

[Verse : Lil Yachty]
Bitch I'm really rich
Check a nigga wrist
Check a nigga neck
Look at how I'm shinin'
Look at all these diamonds
God damn, ice, ice, ice, water
Cash money on me like a nigga Wayne Carter
Shoutout 21, on my daughter slaughter
Professional shit talk
Real diamonds on the young nigga, spent a full check you ain't never seen
Thumbin' through about fifty racks, now the bitch wanna suck all on my penis
It's cold like Minnesota, I thought I told ya
If you ain't know that, now you know, bro
Yeah, my niggas rollin' like a fire truck
Kick the bitch out if she ain't fuckin', that's real
I ain't tellin' jokes, these things how I feel
Lil Boat!
