[Intro]
I will confess, cause I was in love
But now Cassidy's just a plug
She got me lit every time
Taking my shit every time
FaceTiming was never face time
I'm calling back girl every time

[Verse 1]
I start thinking that you might be for me, forreal
I think that coupe was meant for three, forreal
I got that house in Miami
With all these distractions, look I'm a fool, girl
Look I can't tell
If shawty feel me, tell me if you feel me
If I was broke, still grindin' locked in Broward
Would you still feel me?
If feds called and said they caught me on some drugs
Would you leave me?
If I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You'd be way, way back
But there'll never be emotion
You are a grown ass bitch
You the realest (you know that) recognition
I'm just glad that you know
I'm just glad that you know
I guess now that you know, [?]
Glad that you know
My woman is not a bitch, she's a queen
Now that you know this
My woman is not a bitch
My woman is not a bitch
She’s not a ting, she’s a real love’

[Outro]
You're bad for me now
Real one in the world for me
Ride or die all night and everyday for me
All day, nigga
Know you'll ride, know you'll ride
I know you'll ride for me
