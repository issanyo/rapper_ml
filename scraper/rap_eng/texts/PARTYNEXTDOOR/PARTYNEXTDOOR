INTRO
Ooohooyeah
When you gonna fuck with a pro?
Girl let me know ...

VERSE
Tell me that it feels so right
Baby we could party next door
Add a couple more
Bad bitches that smoke and get high
Know you ain't a bore
So what are we waiting for
I ...
I know that you're lonely
Trust me it shows
Just say that you want me

CHORUS (PARTYNEXTDOOR & FindTheL)
Close your eyes while I just
(Kiss on your neck)
Catch your breath cause you know I'm
(Touchin'/Fuckin' you right)
Say it's mine while I just
(Loving you there)
Day and night we could what
(Ever you like) 2x

BREAKDOWN (PARTYNEXTDOOR & FindTheL)
When you gon'?
(Fuck with a pro)
Tell me girl when you gon'
(Come baby fuck with a pro)
I just need to know
(When you gon' let me know?)
I just need to know
(I'll be kissing you slow) 2x
