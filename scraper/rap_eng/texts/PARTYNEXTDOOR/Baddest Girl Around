Baby, pretty baby
I want you to be my lady
I know what you wanna hear, I know what you wanna see
And I can fulfill it daily

I choose you, pretty mama
I choose you pretty, mama
So don't ever guess that I'd settle for less
Baby you are the best, the baddest chick around

I know you're young, we ain't gotta worry bout the numbers
Baby your ex love, forgot ya
And made you forget where the fun was

I choose you, pretty mama
I choose you pretty, mama
So don't ever guess that I'd settle for less
Baby you are the best, the baddest chick around

Oh, the baddest girl around baby, ooh, oh

Listen close to your heart girl
Tell me how you truly feel

I choose you, pretty mama
I choose you pretty, mama
So don't ever guess that I'd settle for less
Baby you are the best, the baddest girl around

I'm sprung and you're sprung
But surely thats gon' turn to love
From day 1, I was sure that you gon' be the one

I choose you, pretty mama
I choose you, pretty mama
So don't ever guess that I'd settle for less
Baby you are the best, the baddest girl around

Ooh, the baddest girl around baby, ooh, oh
