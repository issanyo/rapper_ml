[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Fiesta fiesta
Justine and Fiesta

[Chorus]
Two in the AM come and get it, get it
It's mine, do ya, do ya, do ya dig
You don’t stay, you don’t stay far from the crib
So baby pick up, pick up when I'm calling for it
Skrrrt, pull up, I want goodlove
Pull up, I want goodlove

[Verse 1]
Always go to papi's House, come and take a trip to New York while it's dark out
Batman in the lambo
No ones gotta see us when the lens is colored camo
Gotta keep my favorite song on repeat
Big things backin' up Beep-Beep
You know, you know, you know how to reach me
Hit me on that iMessage or wi-fi
Ricky ricky ricky are you rollin'
Know you like to pull up with the foreign
Every nigga bought but they ain't scoring
Practice? I'm tryna get some more in

[Pre-Chorus]
Wet wet wet tryna get me out my nest
Tryna get me super super super soaked woah
Tryna get ya crackin like a yolk, yo
I just wanna tell you that I'm woke

[Chorus]
Two in the AM come and get it, get it
It's mine [ya, do ya. do ya dig]
You don’t stay, you don’t stay far from the crib
So baby pick up, pick up When I'm calling for it
Skrrrt, pull up, I want goodlove
Pull up, I want goodlove

[Verse 2]
I'm about to start a situation
I'm about to bring it to the basement
Like if i pull up will i get the whole thing
I'm just tryna be up in ya like a nose ring boy
It's raining outside, you want me to put away my pride
You want me to pull out my ride
Cause you think that is easy there for me to slide over to you
It's over when i get to you
I know it's over when you calling me past two
I know it's over cause i'm tryna come fast to ya
Pretty ricky i'm rollin'
Hoppin out the air force like Jordan
Pullin up to practice every morning you know i'll be pouring

[Pre-Chorus]
Wet wet wet tryna get me out my nest
Tryna get me super super super soaked woah
Tryna get ya crackin' like a yolk, yo
I just wanna tell you that I'm woke

[Chorus]
Two in the AM come and get it, get it
It's mine [ya, do ya. do ya dig]
You don’t stay, you don’t stay far from the crib
So baby pick up, pick up When I'm calling for it
Skrrrt, pull up, I want goodlove
Pull up, I want goodlove

[Bridge]
Boy, Don't be
Boy Don't be playing games
Ain't a boy toy (yea)
You're so lucky that I let you get into me
Now you got something to say to your enemies
Ain't no politician but I want Kennedy
I want top, yeah, give me memories
My heart is open for you
Only for you, only for you right now, now
It's 24 open for you, it's 24 open for you right now, now
It's 24 open for you that 365 just for you
But get that Na-Na wet

[Pre-Chorus]
Wet wet wet tryna get me out my nest
Tryna get me super super super soaked woah
Tryna get crackin' like a yolk, yo
I just wanna tell you that I'm woke

[Chorus]
Two in the AM come and get it, get it
Is mine [ya, do ya. do ya dig]
You don’t stay, you don’t stay far from the crib
So baby pick up, pick up When I'm calling for it
Skrrrt, pull up, I want goodlove
Pull up, I want goodlove

[Outro]
I want goodlove, I want goodlove
Good Love oh yeah
