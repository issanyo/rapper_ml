[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Fifty bands later you the one I want
Hundred bands later you the one I want
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Hundred and fifty bands later you the one I want
Two hundred bands baby you the one I want
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I, I got it now, yeah yeah, got it now
I prayed for 50's but now I throw 100's now
At first you was likey likey now you love it now
First I was touchy touchy now I'm touching down (oh oh oh, oh)
I don't think they understand
I don't think they understand
I don't tell em bout our plans (no oh oh, oh)
Don't tell left about the right hand
Don't show your colors unless its vibrant
All real bitches move in silence

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Fifty bands later you the one I want
Hundred bands later you the one I want
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Hundred and fifty bands later you the one I want
Two hundred bands baby you the one I want
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)

[Verse 2: Majid Al Maskati]
Used to bus to class
Now I'm on first class
Champagne in my glass (oh woah oh)
Look at what we did
Young and restless with
Millions here to spend
On the late show
Ready now
Yeah yeah they love me now
They hit me up but I give em the run around
Girl you too heated I thought that I told ya to simmer down
She wants to know if I'm ready I'm ready to see her now
Why would I say no?
I say I'm close
I'll let you know
So let me come by and love me down down down down

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Majid Al Maskati]
'Cause even fifty bands later you the one I want
Hundred bands later you the one I want
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Hundred and fifty bands later you the one I want
Two hundred bands baby you the one I want
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
