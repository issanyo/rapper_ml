[OPENING ]
"That Smile on your face makes it easy"

[RAMAON DEANDA VERSE]
This is how I feel when I be turnt up
Full cup of whatever got me burnt up
Niggas in the club they tripping off whatever man
I'm the nigga in the back wearing leather brand

Got me caught up
Talk behind my back bitch shut up
She love me when I take my shirt off and I
Keep calling her wish a nigga would try

First nigga would die
Laying in the bed imma good guy
But she already know who I am and
That's the reason why she love like I'm fam man

New songs for the record though
New thongs for them extra hoes
I just put her in her place sike
I told her she the reason why I drop them though

[Hook]
This what Sauga feels like in the night time
Bust it open, shawty when the light shine
Still fuckin with the same ass niggas
I know you want a break
I know you want a break from toronto
West Side
Ooh Girl

[PARTYNEXTDOOR Verse 2]
This what Sauga feels like in the night time
Watch what she doin' when the light shine
Drunk niggas try'nna talk in the strip club
Shawty silhouette looks like a dolla sign

Caught up (caught up)
Thats just how a nigga brought up (brought up)
Blow ones for you loonie ass niggas
Straight bounce for you toonie ass niggas

My niggas bigger then the bouncer
Roll up in the bitch still smell like an ounce
Right quick, Right Quick
Tight jeans on so she feels my shit

Tell me something good baby
Tell me something, Tell me something good shawty
Come bring it to the hood baby
Bring it, bring it back to hood

[Hook]
This what Sauga feels like in the night time
Bust it open, shawty when the light shine
Still fuckin with the same ass niggas
I know you want a break
I know you want a break from toronto

[Outro]
West side
Ohh girl
