[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
There's no light in this room
It's all right we got you
You shine like gold
You walk by
Cause a scene all the guys
They agree you shine like gold

[Verse 1 : PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Hey baby
I spy with my little eye
Pretty lady
I dream about you and I
Lady and I know
This might make no sense
But you're the first true girl I met

Baby girl you're shining like a star
Come and give me some of that gold
I can see you shine from afar
I'ma come and give you some love
Cause you know that only you girl
That can light up my world, oh no

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
There's no light in this room
It's all right we got you
You shine like gold
You walk by
Cause a scene all the guys
They agree you shine like gold

[Verse 1]
Hey baby
I spy with my little eye
Pretty lady
I dream about you and I
Lady and I know
This might make no sense
But you're the first true girl I met

[Chorus]
There's no light in this room
It's all right we got you
You shine like gold
You walk by
Cause a scene all the guys
They agree you shine like gold
Hey!
