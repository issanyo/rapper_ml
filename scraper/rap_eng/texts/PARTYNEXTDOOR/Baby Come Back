[Verse 1]
I'm sorry that I didn't realize
That we're meant to be
Girl everyday and every night wish you were with me
Tell me how i'm suppose to be happy, you're finally happy with some else?
Baby girl I know this is selfish but girl I am selfish, there's no one else

[Chorus]
And I didn't realize what I had until you were gone away
Didn't realize what I had until you were was gone away
So baby come back
Come back, come back to me
Baby come back
Come back, come back to me
Oh baby come back
Come back, come back to me
I promise if you give me a chance I'll be a better man

[Verse 2]
I apologize for making you cry, every single night
Girl I give my life just to spare you're life
I'll never think twice
And I never say never to you
Cause when we're together, we're two
And baby we're unbreakable
Baby I just wanna see you

[Chorus]
