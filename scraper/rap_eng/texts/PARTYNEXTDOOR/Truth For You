[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Baby let's just be honest, let's just be honest
I used to pull up in that Ghost sometimes
And go ghost sometimes
Babe if you love somebody that you love sometime
Smoke the only thing on our chest, right now
If sex is all this is then it's best right now
Answer all my questions, it's a test, right now
Mmm, don't make me guess right now

[Verse 1: Amir Obè]
Say a prayer, I just pray you play your part
Never let a broke nigga break your heart
Never let me leave the crib without a mark
Reject the favors that's your favorite part, yeah
Pull up on you with some bread for you
Tat your name up on my chest for you
They was doin' save the best for you
Breathing room, I save my breath for you

[Pre-Hook: Amir Obe]
Pouring up another shot (yeah, yeah)
You want to impress with the rock (yeah, yeah)

She'll be telling me to stop (yeah, yeah)
Twisted up in the wood (yeah, yeah)
In the club as you should (yeah, yeah)
If it was in the club (yeah, yeah)
If it was, mmm
