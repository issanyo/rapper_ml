[Verse 1]
Tell me what I did to deserve, the feeling that I'm feeling right now? (Shawty, yeah, okay)
I'm in a process of patience and elimination (shawty)
Just can't figure it out (baby)
Seems I'm in the place right now (right now)
That could be replaced just now (right now)
Usually I'd said it to you (oh)
But now I'm the burdens to you
You living on me is all I face
I couldn't fake it at all
Thuggin' in the MIA
I can't stay ghost for too long
Spendin' all this [?]

[Chorus]
Mama stay down
My lil' one stay down
My lil' one, my baby stay down
Mama no wait, wait down
All you have to do is stay (stay down)
All you have to do is stay (stay down)
All you have to do is stay (stay down)
All you have to do is stay (wait down)
My lil' one stay down (yeah)
My lil' one stay down
My lil' one stay down
Stay down on the floor
Stay down, wait down, for me

[Verse 2]
Tell me is you down
Way, way, way, way up
And no kidding me
I been gettin' money that's a A-okay
She be used to killling out the passenger side
Have her leaning out the Jeep just to show me how you ride
And I'm mobbin' in the city
How we mobbin' in the streets
She say 'who knew flooding crack into the street make you a street nigga'
All we hold is money, we don't hold the field
Pussy nigga ain't appealing
Fuck that bitch and I'ma charge it tax
Just killed the summer, I call it fallin' back
I been in the game since fall back game
Watchu talkin' 'bout mayne?
Might beat that pussy up 'til that pussy low main'
Shawty know this mobbin shit no game (know this mobbin shit game)

[Chorus]
Stay down
My lil' one stay down
My lil' one, my baby stay down
Mama no wait down
All you have to do is stay (stay down)
All you have to do is stay (stay down)
All you have to do is stay (stay down)
All you have to do is stay (wait down)
My lil' one stay down (stay down on the floor)
My lil' one stay down (stay down on the floor)
My lil' one stay... (Stay down on the floor)
Stay down, wait down, for me
Tell me is you down?
Wait, wait, wait
(stay down on the floor umm yeah)
(stay down on the floor umm nigga)
(stay down on the floor real nigga)
(stay down on the floor real nigga)
(stay down on the floor real nigga)
(stay down on the floor real nigga)
