[Intro]
H, ey nah hurry up, like we need to get on the plane right now
K, hang up the phone, you can't go on the plane with your phone on
Like turn it off
Till, till Young Young Young, we need to get on the flight right now
Till put your camera on the shelf right here, right here yeah
Now be good, let me hollar at the people real quick though

[Verse 1:]
See I'm on this plane and I don't know where I'm headed to
And I'm getting on and I'm not coming back until June
And I've never been so excited
Since I opened up my eyes and saw a pretty little angel
And I've never been so delighted
Being on a plain, I'm 'bout to go insane

[Bridge]
I'm with my mans, and we high, looking fly
I need a girl right by my side
I'm with my dudes, and we high, looking fly
I need a girl right by my side

[Hook]
I'm on a plane, alone
And when i come off I better have a girl around my arm
Where is the girls tonight?
They're all ready to take flight on

Flight 16, we fly, we high, high up in the sky
You ready to take flight on
Flight 16, we fly, we high, high up in the sky
You ready to take flight on
Flight 16, get ready ready for
Flight 16, oh yeah flight 16

[Verse 2:]
Every cloud I pass by, I always ask why
You're not with me
Every time I see a pretty little dove
I wonder if it's you I see
And I've never been so excited
All of your girls are invited
And I've never been so delighted
To say I'm insane, I am on a plane

[Bridge]
I'm with my mans, and we high, looking fly
I need a girl right by my side
I'm with my dudes, and we high, looking fly
I need a girl right by my side

[Hook]
I'm on a plane, alone
And when i come off I better have a girl around my arm
Where is the girls tonight?
They're all ready to take flight on

Flight 16, we fly, we high, high up in the sky
You ready to take flight on
Flight 16, we fly, we high, high up in the sky
You ready to take flight on
Flight 16, get ready ready for
Flight 16, oh yeah flight 16

[Verse 3:]
Urm, I fell in love, with a pretty shawty
Shawty say she need me, and nothing else is worth it
I switched the style up, just to match ya swag
I switched her nails up, just to make the bag
And every other weekend
Shopping malls up in her shopping bag
Spending all the money, cause she know she gonna get it back
Probably in a Louis bag, probably find a Gucci rag
Never found a look like this cause shawty even know she bad
And she ain't jealous 'bout these lady chicks
She know she the only one cause JB doesn't double dip
Even on a rougher chick, promise that I'll never slip

[Bridge]
I'm with my mans, and we high, looking fly

I'm with my dudes, and we high, looking fly
I need a girl right by my side

[Hook]

And when i come off I better have a girl around my arm
Where is the girls tonight?

You ready to take flight on
Flight 16, we fly, we high, high up in the sky
You ready to take flight on
Flight 16, get ready ready for
Flight 16, oh yeah flight 16

[Outro]
Young, I got you, now for real
Everybody put on your seatbelt
Turn off your phones
We about to take flight
Are you ready?
