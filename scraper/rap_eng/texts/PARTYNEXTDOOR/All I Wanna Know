[Pre-Chorus]
I love the drank, and I got weed nigga
Fuck what a nigga think, it's my body
I got bitches, got bitches, got bitches, if you need one
You could be one
I got niggas, many niggas, if you need it
I'ma leave some, I'ma leave some

[Chorus]
All I do is give
I just wanna take some time to be alone
All I wanna do is live

[Verse]
Now I'm on flexin'
Dealin' with possession
Young nigga, young nigga, found love real quick
Lost, lost that love real quick
Mama made me deal with it
I'm fuckin' models over 21
Plenty vision, plenty summers, told you I got plenty summers
Mama still trippin', then I bought my mom a bigger house
Couldn't be a nigga house
Lookin' for a real bitch
Lookin' for a real one, prolly gon' have to steal one
I'm ridin' with the go-getters
Ridin' with attention, you don't want attention
Since there's more money then you know there's more protection
Got a little bad bitch on my arm cause
You know it’s only good for a young nigga reflection
You know I need that good weed
Bitch's sex, good neck
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetra
Nigga, hoes cold, hoes trapping, god bless you
Never took the ting up off the dresser
This that OVO shit, my nigga
God bless you
Férina, forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Still I love the drank, and I got weed
Fuck what a nigga think, it's my body
I got bitches, got bitches, got bitches if you need one
I got niggas, many niggas if you need it
I'ma leave some, I'ma leave some

[Chorus]
All I do is give
I just wanna take some time to be alone
All I wanna do is live
Nigga, all I wanna do is live
All I do is give
I just wanna take some time to be alone
All I wanna do is live
(Yeah, nigga)
All I wanna do is live
