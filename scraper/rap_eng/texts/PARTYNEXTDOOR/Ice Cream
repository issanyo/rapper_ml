[Intro]
Are you happy babe?
If you're let me know, let me know what
That you're happy babe
Is it drugs, is it love, is it ice cream?
What the fuck, tell me babe

[Verse 1]
I wanna see you smile
Did your ex not say that your perfect?
Ohhh girl you're fucking perfect
Even my momma say you perfect
All the stress you went through [?] you worth it
Being happy isn't a decision

[Hook]
I want you to feel that way
Whatever makes you happy babe
Whatever makes you happy babe
Is it drugs? is it love? is it ice cream with the fudge?
Whatever makes you happy babe
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever makes my baby happy
Drugs, love, ice cream with the fudge
Drugs, love, ice cream with the fudge
Drugs, love, ice cream with the fudge
Drugs, love, ice cream with the fudge

[Verse 2]
Babe, [?]
I can't tell why you're not [?]
Show me where it hurt, I can make it feel good baby
I swear, I swear, I can make it feel good baby

[Hook]
Whatever makes you happy babe
Whatever makes you happy babe
Is it drugs? is it love? is it ice cream with the fudge?
Whatever makes you happy babe
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever makes my baby happy
Drugs, love, ice cream with the fudge
Drugs, love, ice cream with the fudge
Drugs, love, ice cream with the fudge
Drugs, love, ice cream with the fudge
