Homegirl I noticed
That every time I come around your focused
About the way that I put it down
Put it down, put it down
Mmmm, so damn clean
So damn fly
All your girls wonder who's I
My name Jahron, Jahron B
Mmmm

And your number number
What's your name?
And your number number

[Verse 2: Richie]
Aquafina flow got your women wet
And I have never met a women that I couldn't get
I call her everyday
If not we're on the internet
The flow is super dope
The swag is always in effect
Text me
Tease me
Just don't never leave me
Girl you lock my heart now can you throw away the key please
Yeah, I keep it fresher than a squeegee
I'm on a iPod
