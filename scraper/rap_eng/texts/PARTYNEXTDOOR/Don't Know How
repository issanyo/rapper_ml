[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
No girl you're not sick, it's all in your stomach
Yeah, yeah, we fuckin', let me get deeper now
Deeper than details now
Kissing you neck, lick your thigh and your body
You say fuck what you heard 'bout it
Now I got you nervous 'bout it
I'll make sure that you're not disappointed
Especially knowing this is all you wanted

[Pre-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
All this time I spent slowing it down
Now you wanna go fast, now I go fast
Bet you ready now

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Girl you best know how to fuck baby
And to make love, the way you look
Girl you best know how, mhmm, to fuck
And to make love, girl, the way that you look
The way that you look
I know you know how

[Post-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Majid Al Maskati]
I know that you know
