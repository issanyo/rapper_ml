[Pre-Hook]
All of my lifestyle has working
All of my life I put work in
I remember going to school with no shirt
I remember going to school with red dirt on my sneaker

[Hook]
All my niggas need to leave Jamaica
All my niggas need a goddamn Visa
All of my niggas still need a goddamn vacation
All of my niggas please, please stay patient

[Verse]
Fuck every nigga that owe me something
Imma cut class I got pussy that's coming
Imma cut the seed like Mimi Faust
Ballin' like Curry cus you know I got, sauce
Every bitch that used to diss me wanna hit me up
Every bitch that used to kiss me wanna lick me up
Fucking up the city, I hope it's all on video
Every nigga taking credit, thank God for residuals
I be in and out of Instagrams like it's whatever man
Niggas snitching turning over faster than the packet can
I got exes 'bout to do four years up in the can
I'm the youngest nigga livin', Imma get it how I can

[Pre-Hook]
All of my lifestyle has working
All of my life I put work in
I remember going to school with no shirt
I remember going to school with red dirt on my sneaker

[Hook]
All my niggas need to leave Jamaica
All my niggas need a goddamn Visa
All of my niggas still need a goddamn vacation
All of my niggas please, please stay patient
