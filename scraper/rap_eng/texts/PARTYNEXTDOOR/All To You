[Verse 1]
Girl I know that you've been hurt before
But I should not lock the door
On the other side there's love and affection
And the key is where you should be
And that happens to be with me
Shawty you gon' have to trust, any

[Pre-Chorus]
See a chance with you would be perfect
A risk would be worth it
And I know you need a foundation
And all that I'm saying
Is that I'm hoping I'm praying
That you listen to me girl cause I'm waiting

[Chorus]
My all, my heart
My love and affection
My time and attention
Give it all to you
My all, my heart
My love and affection
My time and attention
Give it all to you

[Verse 2]
Girl see how I treasure your heart
I'd never tear it apart
Guys have said that before
But I mean it
And any guy that told you he loves you
I know that you never believed it
But baby girl you better believe it
Cause I mean it

[Pre-Chorus]
See a chance with you would be perfect
A risk would be worth it
And I know you need a foundation
And all that I'm saying
Is that I'm hoping I'm praying
That you listen to me girl cause I'm waiting

[Chorus]
My all, my heart
My love and affection
My time and attention
Give it all to you
My all, my heart
My love and affection
My time and attention
Give it all to you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus](x2)
My all, my heart
My love and affection
My time and attention
Give it all to you
My all, my heart
My love and affection
My time and attention
Give it all to you
My all, my heart
My love and affection
My time and attention
Give it all to you
My all, my heart
My love and affection
My time and attention
Give it all to you
