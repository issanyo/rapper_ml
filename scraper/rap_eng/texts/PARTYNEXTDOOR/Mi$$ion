[Verse 1]
My my money on my mind
My time priceless you can't buy
Don't get ahead of yourself
Got a fine fine bitch on my side
She wants me all of the time
But she can't be my girl (Ohh)

[Pre-Hook]
She thinking with her heart, I'm thinking in numbers
Two halves are better than one, that's why

[Hook]
I gives a fuck bout this bitches because the money's the mission (x3)
I gives a fuck (x3)
That's what it is

[Verse 2]
I, I, I ain't gonna lie
Chances all that I won't try
To stay in touch
Fun fun that's when I'm on
Give me some, next minute I'm gone
My type of love

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Bridge]
Ohh
Give me a minute, I need to grow
Before we get too serious
I told you straight up, I'm not a player
I'll break the bank before I break your heart

[Hook]
