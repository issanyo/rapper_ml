[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Promise that you'll never leave me
Promise me that you care
Promise that you'll never hurt me
And that you'll always be there

And if we stick with the truth
You gave me everything
Give me all of your riches
And give me all of your pain

[Bridge]
And I, I don't know what to do
My hungers not for food
Change my attitude, towards you

And I, I'm tryna be better
But that won't change the weather
It's a cloudy afternoon...

[Chorus]

'Cause your the apple to my pie
And you're the straw the my berry
You're the smoke to my high
And you're the one I wanna marry

So, baby why would you go
From me (from me)

Baby why would you leave
From me (from me)

Baby why would you walk
From me (from me)
Walk away from me

On the day I marry you..
