Codiene's bumpin'
Molly's thumping
Liquor's on my mind
Weed is in the air
With my cares
Do this all the time
Right?

Come baby, come with me
Come with me
I know where you can run baby
I know where you can run baby
Take a sip of rum baby
With some kind of rum baby
Come and get some baby
Imma give you... Imma give you some baby
Feeling like Rick James
Now your shit trashed
Fucking with the clique man
Getting with the clique man
Just as how the song goes
Listen what you feel like
I'm geeking, I'm freaking
Paper just ain't for show baby
Gotta let these haters know baby

Stay sweet for me
Mm, stay sweet, stay sweet, stay sweet
Girl, stay sweet, stay sweet
Stay
Oh
Stay

Codiene's bumpin'
Molly's thumping
Liquor's on my mind
Weed is in the air
With my cares
Do this all the time

Hmm codiene is bumping
Hmm molly's still thumping
Hmm liquor's still on my mind
We do this all the time
Weed is in the air
With my cares
