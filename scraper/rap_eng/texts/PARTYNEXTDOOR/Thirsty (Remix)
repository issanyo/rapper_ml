[Intro]
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
Ching, ching, gettin' paid over here
Ching, ching, gettin' paid over here

[PND Verse 1]
I wanna kiss you, girl, I wanna kiss you
Girl, I wanna love you
Oh, am I moving too fast?
Fuck that (Well, well, well...)
Your momma must have taught you well
Cause you taste so purified
Need to get it while it's hot cause I'm cold at times
Open up to me and drop your guard, I need the proof
Constantly to know if you still have a heart
Cause a nigga done fucked up I feel like I lucked up, I know it's hard
But hop in your car and bring it to me

[Pre-Hook]
Promise to love you, and obey
And hit it more than once a day
Girl I say that genuinely
Fuck that bitch.. It's what you say

[Hook]
Bring it over
Bring it over
Baby bring it over
Bring it over to me
Now, baby, bring it over
Bring it over
Baby bring it over to me
Bring it, bring it

[Wale]
I'm DMV, and she say she from T.Dot (kick your feet up)
I bring the tree out and we'll see what she bout
After them three cups I'm tower of Pisa
Know when I see that pussy MPC out
Guess that's the freestyle I'm about to beatbox
You're a joke ho, twerk ho
Thought I saw sh back like it's a nerve ho
Got'em O-side [?]
North's fella G but a star in many horoscopes
Really who dem niggas see?
But you and I got chemistry
H-Town, seen a couple things
But it would take a fuckin' miracle for me to cheat
Hol' Up
You get it miracle?
You don't find it funny not even a little though?
Give me tutelage, I'm tryna study you
Getting college brain while you're graduating middle school?
I mean ate out
To Wale 'bout
Tell my haters "no bueno",  get the Cuban link out
Mmm, scratchin' my back, Wolverine now
[?]
Swear your X man
I don't care about your partner though
Cause a nigga gotta go where he gotta go
Asshole! pussy never got a petro
Gas hoes but I will take that ass home
Special teams shawty now you throw it back forth
Give it to me, give it to me like a mascot
Prolly thinking nigga fakin' [?]
Like a fucking party next door

[PND Verse 2]
But does he kiss you, girl?
Does he kiss you, girl, does he love you?
(Tell me what he do)
Am I moving too fast?
Fuck that (My, my, my...)
I thought you were always mine (Yea, I thought some shit)
I'll play my role, just give me the script
Time to let go, tell him give you your shit
Hop in your whip, girl
I'm back in the 6, girl
Still need a bad bitch who thirsty
Shawty holla at me if you heard me
