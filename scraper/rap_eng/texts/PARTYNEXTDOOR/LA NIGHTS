[Tinashe/G. Ry Tag]
G. Ry got me!

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Man, the sun shine bright out here (shine)
Shawty jeans fit tight out here
And I be high as kite out here
Smoke good all day, all night out here
The bad ones, man, the whole crew
A little 1942 and it all got comfortable in the coupe, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
It's just another LA night
Everybody, somebody
Fast livin' as in if the party live, yeah, yeah
It's just another LA night
More stars in the night sky, I (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
No dis-crimination
All the flavors in LA
Fellas poppin' out in DA
'Cause you know that the chicks don't play
Shawty by my side
I know for sure she gon' ride
Pull up, hop out, matchin' fly
Killer scene, homicide, yeah
Hopped up out the couch and kiss me, baby (ayy)
Hurry with the bottles I ain't for waitin'
We gon' make a scene 'cause they watchin', ain't they
Makin' haters mad, we make a game of it
Smokin' Louis thirteen like a baker's dozen
You got designer everything, you know the name of it
If you ever been here, I ain't gotta say nothin'
You's hella pretty, hella greedy but you gotta love it

[Pre-Chorus]
Man, the sun shine bright out here (bright out here)
Shawty jeans fit tight out here (jeans real tight out here)
And I be high as kite out here (yeah)
Smoke good all day, all night out here (all night)
The bad ones, man, the whole crew (whole crew)
A little 1942 and it all got comfortable in the coupe, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
It's just another LA night
Everybody, somebody
Fast livin' as in if the party live, yeah, yeah
It's just another LA night
More stars in the night sky, I (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Champagne, champagne (champagne)
Try not to spill it when you dancin' (when you dancin', yeah)
Only cash, lil' mama, do the damn thing (do the damn thing)
Got the fellas tryna get you any damn thing that you want (want)
Girl, say you got a man but you don't now (you don't now)
You just like to watch 'em, get excited by the option
And get the hopes up high 'fore you drop 'em right
Hollywood (Hollywood), to the hood (to the hood)
Same rule apply, hustle 'til you eat good (hustle 'til you eat good)
And then hustle when you eat good, yeah (and then hustle when you eat good)
Somebody said, live fast die young when you drop
So bitches at your funeral pop
I told 'em, no, I'd rather take my time, stack mine and go out on top, ayy

[Pre-Chorus]
Man, the sun shine bright out here (oh, oh)
Shawty jeans fit tight out here (oh, girl)
And I be high as kite out here
Smoke good all day, all night out here (yeah, yeah)
The bad ones, man, the whole crew
A little 1942 and it all got comfortable in the coupe, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
It's just another LA night (LA night)
Everybody, somebody (somebody)
Fast livin' as in if the party live, yeah (livin' the party night)
It's just another LA night (another LA night)
More stars in the night sky (night sky, night sky), I (yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
All drinks on me, all drinks on me
You with a freak, show it to me, yeah
Sun's goin' down, sun's goin' down
LA you get down, not a better time
