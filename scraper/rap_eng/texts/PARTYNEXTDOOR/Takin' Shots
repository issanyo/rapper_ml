[Chorus]
Drinkin' all night, but we ain't done yet (Yet)
Waitin' on the plug, but he ain't come yet (Yet)
Still need somethin'? Put your bank on it (Bank on it)
Got a big bag with a Bape on it (Bape on)
Party ain't over if they say somethin' (Say somethin')
No sleep 'til I've seen three suns (Three suns)
Party gon' end with a threesome (Threesome)
Raw dog, prolly have three sons
Chasin' the Perc' with some Buddy, that shit never lets me down (Uhm)
They go to work for some money, we make it from actin' out (Uhm)
Grrrrrah, we takin' shots right now (Shots right now)
Grrrrrah, yeah, we takin' shots right now (Shots)

[Verse 1]
See me in a 'Rari goin' vroom-vroom (Skrrt, skrrt)
Sexy motherfucker in a cartoon
Saint Laurent, 40, on a new suit
Sippin' Bud Light, that's a new cruise
Baby, bust it open like woo-hoo
The diamonds got cut like a boo-boo
Pockets so fat, rock a muu-muu
Me and Dre came for the pum pum
Drippin', drippin', drippin', women tryna take my millions
Help my bro with an assist I'm Jason Williams (White Chocolate)
Heard that there's a party, I might pay a visit (Visit)
That's a moment, hopped out frog like ribbit, ribbit (Skrrt)

[Pre-Chorus]
Drunk when I walked in the door, so fuckin' high like, "Hello"
I told her pour me some more, then she went right for the blow (The blow)
30 more girls wanna roll, let's get this bitch on the road (On the road)
Already losin' control, this is the life that we chose

[Chorus]
Drinkin' all night, but we ain't done yet (Yet)
Waitin' on the plug, but he ain't come yet (Yet)
Still need somethin'? Put your bank on it (Bank on it)
Got a big bag with a Bape on it (Bape on)
Party ain't over if they say somethin' (Say somethin')
No sleep 'til I've seen three suns (Three suns)
Party gon' end with a threesome (Threesome)
Raw dog, prolly have three sons
Chasin' the Perc' with some Buddy, that shit never lets me down (Uhm)
They go to work for some money, we make it from actin' out (Uhm)
Grrrrrah, we takin' shots right now (Shots right now)
Grrrrrah, yeah, we takin' shots right now (Shots)

[Verse 2]
Frontin' on me, but you love it (Love it)
Tryna act like you above it ('Bove it)
Dad bod know you wanna rub it (Rub it)
Have you ever done it in public?
Sippin' all night, let it rotate
Baby, just for the night, you my soulmate
Mixin' vodka with the champagne
Tell me how much liquor can a man take
How many records have I sold?
I don't even know, can't keep count (Nope)
You know that I've been on a roll
Celebratin' life when I come around (Come around)
Sippin' all night, sippin' all day
Brought the beerbong out like a tailgate
Holdin' big words that I can't say
Got me speakin' drunkanese, can you translate?

[Pre-Chorus]
Drunk when I walked in the door, so fuckin' high like, "Hello"
I told her pour me some more, then she went right for the blow (The blow)
30 more girls wanna roll, let's get this bitch on the road (On the road)
Already losin' control, this is the life that we chose

[Chorus]
Drinkin' all night, but we ain't done yet (Yet)
Waitin' on the plug, but he ain't come yet (Yet)
Still need somethin'? Put your bank on it (Bank on it)
Got a big bag with a Bape on it (Bape on)
Party ain't over if they say somethin' (Say somethin')
No sleep 'til I've seen three suns (Three suns)
Party gon' end with a threesome (Threesome)
