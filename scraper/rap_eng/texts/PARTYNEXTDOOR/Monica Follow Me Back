[Intro]
What up y'all?
It's your boy Jahron. B
And I made this song for a girl on Twitter
And I want her to follow me
So I hope this song helps her make up her mind
Haha, listen

[Verse]
She pretty in the face
Trust me I got some taste
Girl I cannot not wait
For Monica to follow me back
I want her, I see her
She far but won't leave her alone
'Till Monica follows me back

[Bridge]
And if she want some more
She can follow
Monica just follow me back
Oh Monica, oh Monica just follow me

[Chorus]
Girl follow, cause I'mma follow you
Girl follow, cause I'mma follow you
When I follow
So Monica, follow me back
Follow me back, follow me back oh
Monica follow me back
