[Verse1]
Persian Rugs, but she's from Nicaragua
Thought you was Persian, love
Are we turning up ?
Or are we wasting time?
Girl, don't waste my time
I don't want to party no
Girl i just want to chill with you
Oh no no no no no
Girl I know you trying to roll
Say you’re different from them other girls
But I’m not so sure

[Pre-Hook]
Cause we got a good thing
I hope that I’ma see you again (Cole world)
Don't know what's on your brain
I bet you wish this never would end

[Hook]
Let me get you right
Cause you running on empty
Vibing all night
Listening to west district
In love with your smile
And your body so sexy
From your lips to your ties
You got a nigga so ready
---

(For whatever)
For what (x3)
(It's Whatever)
For what (x3)
Got me ready for whatever
But Baby we know better
(Oh No)

[Verse2]
Persian Rugs
She's from Nicaragua
You didn’t get enough (Of my love)
(Of x2) my love
But you know what's up
(Yeh,i bet you do baby)
You know, I know
You trying to go
But you’re denying on the low
Girl hurry up
It's not too late
Asked if i loved you i said maybe

[Outro]
But you said you do
And that's what like about you
The least I’ma do
Is not hurting you
(Oh)
