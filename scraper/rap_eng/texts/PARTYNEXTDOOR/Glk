[Verse 1]
Coming out the jungle with bongos running with the apes in the field"
Ar 15 reloaded with the stock bullet's in the chamber ready for war"
Monkeys running around, we just might hit your front door"
Fruity twist on my clothes smell like my strong cologne , my woman hitting up my phone
Dripping sauce am water whipping, stirring up the pot"
I got the bloc hot with a bunch of people making a movie film shot"
Get back in place it like you losing your only chance only shot to stay in this race"
Am the new monster incorporated file that's in the system"

[Chorus]
O o o why you gotta break my heart "
We could of been so far apart"
Are love was just a misunderstanding "
We could of been so apart"
Why you gotta break me apart like you do"

[verse 2]
The back talking and back mouthing got to stop"
How many time i tell you to cleanse your soul"
Your making me so heartless, am getting so cold"
My heart on another level on wanting you foreshore"
Why can't we just give us a shot huh and stop hating "
