Don't start acting like you care all now
I'm about to leave, you telling all these different lies right now
I don't mean to sound hard on the call but it's hard right now
Since you've been gone I've been thinkin on my own right now, yeah
Swear you got me feeling some way now, oh
Lately I've been so deep in my thoughts I'm away right now
I'm living alone and you know I'm feeling some way right now
I never thought I'd be lost, I just don't understand this right now
It's after 3AM and I'm venting frustration of you right now

[PARTYNEXTDOOR]
All I’m talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All I’m tryna say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

[B.K.P.]
I been up for nine whole days wondering what I did to keep you going
Nothing but thoughts about calling you asking where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
You changed, people changed, my life changed too
Even in my absence I was still tryna understand you
I remember you saying you weren't a hoe, yeah you said that?
And I believed you when they told me no, yeah I thought you meant that
But I ain't gonna act like your misguided cause I even lied to you

[PARTYNEXTDOOR]
All I’m talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All I’m tryna say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

[B.K.P.]
Why this gotta end girl, why this gotta end?
I swear I'll give you anything that you want
I don't understand what I need to say without soundin smart
Just cause niggas got hearts don't mean they got heart
Why am I the one you concealed, is that honestly how you feel
If anything should change then it should have been rebuilt
Lately I've been questioning tryna understand what’s your deal?
Doing things to make you feel the way I made you feel
How hard is it to know that I needed time to make a home
Now this time you're all scared, maybe I'll block away myself so I can rewind that day
I don't even know what things are looking like inside of your eyes or how I’m opinionated
This event I'm getting one-sided, I’m gettin kinda sick right now

[PARTYNEXTDOOR]
All I’m talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All I’m tryna say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
