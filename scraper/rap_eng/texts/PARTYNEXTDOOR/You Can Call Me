[Verse 1]
Saw you at the mall a month ago
I had a feeling that your momma stole an angel from heaven
And I really gotta let you know
You were what JB's been looking for
Ladies always ask 'why you speak in third person?'
It's cause I'm nervous in person
But when I'm with you it's different, Oh so different

[Pre-Hook]
Girl when I approach you
I don't wanna spit game I just wanna know your name
Girl when I approach you
I don't want your number, I just wanna know your name

[Hook]
Even though we just met, (You can call me)
Every time you're upset, ( You can call me)
When you need to get [wet], (You can call me)
Need to sleep together,(You can call me)
You can call me
You can call me
You can call me
Anytime, Anywhere, [?]
You can call me

[Verse 2]
Now I'm standing at your front door
Told your pops I'm taking you tonight
Told him that we just going out to eat
Have dinner and desert and candle light
All I wanna do is be there for you
The other boys know that I adore you
No secrets get kept around us
Cause only [?] could we trust

[Pre-Hook]
Girl when I approach you
I don't wanna [?] I just wanna know your name
Girl when I approach you

[Verse 3]
I'm not tryna be clich√© ma, but you drive me wild
Feeling your swag ,and I'm digging your style and [?]

Free on the weekend and after three
