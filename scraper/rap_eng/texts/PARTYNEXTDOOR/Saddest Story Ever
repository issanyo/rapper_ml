[Verse]
I was a jerk, was a jerk
I was a fool, was a fool
I was an asshole but who are you to judge me (real)
PS I hope you get this letter, dear god
I turn the best friends to a ex friends
Because the [?] is she found in my Levis
And I know that she is on birth control
And I realize, [?] the lies I told her
Best friends to get into their pants
I said my girl's gone
Now she's gone, away
I said my girl's left me
Now she's left me, alone
Left me for my best friend
