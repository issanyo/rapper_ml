[Verse]
Tell them sometimes you wake up
Sex's the last thing that's on your mind
Covered in makeup
Swear the prettiest things are hardest to find
Girl I'm still lookin' for you
Where could you be? Prolly somewhere in the UV
Tip-toein' out the whip cause you had too much to sip
Might as well be like me, take your time, let the liquor sit
Girl, I will wait for you
I will wait for you
Girl, I will wait for you
To get in the right state of mind
Girl, girl I need you, gotta see you
[?]
[?], got to take it [?]

[Outro]
Good girl, I hit nice and slow
Good girl, I hit nice
Good girl, I hit nice
