[Verse 1]
You've fucked up, I fucked up, we fucking together
You messed up, I messed up, we messing together
Turn that frown upside down while we trading place
You on top I'm on top keep making them faces
Girl gon' make some noise while I do my thing
Show me how you feel watch me [?]
Love it when you mad cause you keep it roll
Can I ask one thing, can we make up

[Chorus]
It can be that make up sex
We ain't even break up but its the best
I know you you still mad but girl this is our time
Let's touch down, touch down all night
Make up sex
Make up sex
Make up sex
Make up sex
Make up sex

[Verse 2]
You tripping, I'm tripping we fell for each other
You licking, I'm kissing, we touching each other
Turn around on the bed, baby keep it low
We ain't making love so let's not take it slow
Like Ciara said come and ride the beat girl I'm the beat
While deep dive [?] girl I'm a freak
Girl I know, this feelings too good for you to say no
Girl let's make up

[Chorus]
It can be that make up sex
We ain't even break up but its the best
I know you you still mad but girl this is our time
Let's touch down, touch down all night
Make up sex
Make up sex
Make up sex
Make up sex
Make up sex

[Verse 3]
Take you down
Let me know when you're about to uh
We'll just [?]
In between the city of love
Girl I'm about to go down town on ya
Don't let my body go, cause I'mma whip that frown right up off ya
Let's make up

[Chorus]
It can be that make up sex
We ain't even break up but its the best
I know you you still mad but girl this is our time
Let's touch down, touch down all night
Make up sex
Make up sex
Make up sex
Make up sex
Make up sex
