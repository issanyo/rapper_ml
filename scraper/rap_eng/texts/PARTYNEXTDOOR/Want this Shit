[Verse 1]
Watch your ass turnin' brown on the beach (want it, want it)
Thats too much temptation [?] (i still want it, want it)
Tell your impatient friends we've just begun
Yeah, yeah (want it, want it)
But fucking with me tonight, oh (want it, want it)
I kept something waiting for you (How you want it, want it)
Call it what you want baby
I got what you need
Tell me what you want
But i got what you need

[Chorus]
Act like you want some (act like it)
Act like you want some (act like it)
Act like you want this dick (want it, want it)
Act
Act like you want some (act like it)
Act like you want this dick (act like it)
Act like you want this shit (want it, want it)

[Verse 2]
I could get to [?] baby
But you gonna get to playing baby
You don't you know what you be getting yourself into
But get into your mood
Shawty fuck me like I'm on my way to trial
Fuck me like you know its been a while
Tell me what you want baby I know (what you need)

[Chorus]
Act like you want some (act like it)
Act like you want some (better act like it)
Act like you want this dick (like you want it)
Yeah
Act like you want some
Act like you want some
