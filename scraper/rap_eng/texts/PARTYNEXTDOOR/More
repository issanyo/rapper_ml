[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lose this bitch, I'm gonna get another
Money, money, money, that's my brother
I need more, I need more, I need more, more
I need more, I need more, I need more, more
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse: Quavo]
Ayy, they lookin' at me like a water fountain
The way I'm flowin', flowin', flowin', flowin'
They lookin' at me like a water fountain
The way I'm goin', goin', goin', goin'
I need more, I need more, I need more, more
I'm so up, yeah I feel like I'm on the top floor
Life so dangerous, the Bible in the top drawer
One question, gotta tell me what you'd die for
Ayy, go Forrest, to that money, run Forrest (yeah)
Hot boys, yeah we really hot boys (yeah)
Your girl, yeah she really not yours (ayy, ayy)
Got the key to the streets
Been pushin' so long, don't need a key
Got the key to the streets, yeah, yeah
If I lose a bitch then I'ma get another one
Treat her just the same, just like the other one

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lose this bitch, I'm gonna get another
Money, money, money, that's my brother
I need more, I need more, I need more, more
I need more, I need more, I need more, more
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
