[Intro]
This is just all I know

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm young and full of energy (energy)
Whatever I got right now was meant for me (woah, oh)
What happens right now was meant to be (woah, oh)
Baby, best friends is what we're s'posed to be

[Chorus]
We were better bein' best friends
We was better bein' best friends
We was better at bein' best friends
No expectations
We were better bein' best friends
We were better bein' best friends
Girl, we was better at bein' best friends
Girl, we was better at bein' best friends
There was no limitations
I could say anything to you
Girl, we was better at bein' best friends

[Verse 1]
We were better at bein' best friends
I guess change coulda made the best sense
I provided, but you wanted, wanted on your own, yeah
We fuckin' while we fightin', baby, we argue like we 40
Walkin' up and down in Rodeo
You see me workin' like Mexicans for the pesos
I want you to be mine
I want you to be in my life
Baby it's the wrong time
Baby it's the wrong time

[Refrain]
We didn't play out perfect, I slipped up plenty
Every cent was worth it
And girl I mean it when I say that you are special
I'm not ready, you looked me in my face and said

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm young and full of energy (energy)
Whatever I got right now was meant for me (woah, oh)
What happens right now was meant to be (woah, oh)
Baby, best friends is what we're s'posed to be

[Chorus]
We were better bein' best friends
We was better bein' best friends
We was better at bein' best friends
No expectations
We were better bein' best friends
We were better bein' best friends
Girl, we was better at bein' best friends
Girl, we was better at bein' best friends
There was no limitations
I could say anything to you
Girl, we was better at bein' best friends

[Verse 2]
I don't want you to hate me
I don't want you to love me less
I'm in the wrong
Right now I'ma try my best
If you leave me right now, it's for the best
Girl, I gotta eat it, baby, yeah, yeah
I can't buy your love
I can't buy your trust back in no store
No bag, no bag
Nobody can replace what we had

[Refrain]
We didn't play out perfect, I slipped up plenty
Every cent was worth it
And girl I mean it when I say that you are special
I'm not ready, you looked me in my face and said

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm young and full of energy (energy)
Whatever I got right now was meant for me (woah, oh)
What happens right now was meant to be (woah, oh)
Baby, best friends is what we're s'posed to be

[Chorus]
We were better bein' best friends
We was better bein' best friends
We was better at bein' best friends
No expectations
We were better bein' best friends
We were better bein' best friends
Girl, we was better at bein' best friends
Girl, we was better at bein' best friends
There was no limitations
I could say anything to you
Girl, we was better at bein' best friends, oh

[Outro]
