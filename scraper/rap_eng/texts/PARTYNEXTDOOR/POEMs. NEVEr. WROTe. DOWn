Picante was thee pace we was on
Slow it down
Speed it up
Same chase I was on
I knew
Thinking bout her last night
Met her in a past life
Living a wild life
Like we hang @ zoo

If her face was a book
Or her book was a face
Tell me would you look
Or would you just turn a page
Cuz she looking so alone
Can you read along?
Same letter same same word and thee page we was on

Baby we can do it any place that you choose
Anything that they won't then tell em that I do
You a trip I would take near a lake plus thee view
Make thee world stand still with thee way that you move

You thee sunlight thee earth go round
No permits we can zone out
You a poem never write down
I need face time put thee phone down . . ..
