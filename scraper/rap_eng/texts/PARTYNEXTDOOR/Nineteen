[Verse 1]
It's Nicky
The Jeff Dahm' of my city
I'll eat your fucking kidney
Then get right back to my jiggy, bitch
My bank so fucking piggy
Ain't that a fucking pity?
Type to walk right up to Diddy
Say I'll shit on fucking Biggie, bitch
I'm so notorious
Just have faith, baby
And take your time
We can be victorious
Say you want a bad boy
So now you're mine
Boss up with your time, dog
Cause I’m taking my time off
Where the fuck do my time go?
Had the coach scream timeout
I just needed a break from this
But you know a nigga runs back
Hope you little niggas take from this
Before Nicky come back
Wanna be me
That’s part of your pain
Stewardess calling
Please pardon my plane
Ja Ruling hoes
Irv Gotti your dame
Better watch your mouth
Before I body your lane
Niggas fucking my ex-bitches
Well I’m fucking too
Better not fuck to that radio
Cause I’ll come on
Now who the fuck is you?
I had Jazzmine and then Jasmine
She lied and say I ain’t have it
Nakita and then Laresa
Then Jeremiah tagged it
We plastered it with the plastic
He passed it faster than alleys
He brought it down the court
And I dunked it right in the basket, I mean
And then Breanna Jones
Then jump off Samantha
Went from cheerleading my balls
To these boys getting them tatted
And Kandise
Who gave the best head I fucking had in a minute
I meant it you fucking young, but on a tandem
Right back to Shanti
Oh Shanti, I loved you
Remember my name
Remember my love, baby
Remember my chain
Remember my sex
Remember that well
No grudges or nothing
Baby, I’ll see you in hell
Malcom, KB, fuck them
Not gay but I’ll fuck them
Drop them in that Frank Ocean
Lance Bass sunk with them
Little ol' me mentioned Marque
Kim, Ama, D.R
Little ol' bitch that I fucked with G
Can’t remember her name
But the pussy stinked, on God
And then there was about like three Kristen’s
A Christina
A Cecilia, what up
And a Joseph
I'm just playing
Fuck the label, I’ll get the dough
Won’t pay a nigga, that’s good to know
Cause all I need is Sho to get on that Suge shit
And I’m good to go
Won’t hit your chick
But she stripped the clothes
Not interested, told Sixty stroke
They boogied some, didn’t pick the nose
So don’t fuck my bitch, cause I’ll hit the hoe
And I like your momma say I said hello
I’ll 69 on five, that’s 64
Lola, cause I’m trying to fuck forever like
I’ll be true to you
Is it real with me?
Am I getting through to you, Lola?
Next...

[Verse 2]
Since 16 years old
I ain’t had to touch a fucking drug, boy
Had to hit my twenties
Like I punched a fucking dub, boy
Four hoes in one day
And I ain’t even use a glove, boy
I just fucking bathe
And pray that God is in this Dove, uh
How it feel knowing your bitch is in the suds, boy?
Keep it gravy
Lady Marmalade up in this tub, boy
Probably hate it, say it
I won’t waste this fucking slug, boy
Cause play that and play with me
I’ma find out who you love, boy

[Verse 3]
In my best Lil' Wayne impression, uh...
I got chrome on this Bugatti
I’m strong in this Bugatti
Two V8’s
Ain’t no such thing as driving calm in this Bugatti
Bitch I'm bad, I'm worse
I pass the purp
Don’t fuck with me
Cause right now I’m higher than Cap—
Spock, bitch
Cause I’ll pop, bitch
Carter who?
I’m Pac, bitch
These niggas hot cause their bitch adore me
Got to swear to God I ain’t knock bitch
Like bras ripped, my top’s missing
My top slit like goth wrists
My Hyundai just entrée
I’ll pop Chris like parks switched, damn
I said I’ll pop Chris like parks switched
So stand back
This skinny nigga got this
Fucking haters mad cause they not this
It’s XCI till we senile like the fucking Loch Ness
Get it?

[Verse 4]
I'm getting so paid
I ain't touch no work since I was 16
Apologize if I try to buy anything I don't need
Like what's up with you four bitches?
We can all have a ball, believe me
And what's up with these old niggas?
And why they think that I'll fall so easy, bitch?
I know you want to be
You got to be
You trying to be rich
You see me going God
And you staring hard
But please hop off of my dick
Looking at my angels hovering my last supper
You washing my dish, Lord...
B-Boyz
B-Boyz right on you, bitch
It's TDE
YMCMB business, bitch

[Bridge]
Who would've thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all—

[Verse 5]
Mixed by Brian
Drummed by Conan
Perry Donta'e keep it going
Got that juice but hold the pulp
In suit and tie
But tie with no one
Tie your phone
Untie your sew-in
Try your hoe
Both times I'm chosen
Lord, I got that Justin Bieber
One Direction, Edward Cullen
Pop that pussy
Bust it open
Drop that top
That pussy socking
Out here balling
Out here Rose-ing
Out here Bron-ing
Out here Kob-ing, bitch
I told you ain't no sleeping
You won't see me fucking dozing
Fuck you know?
It's XCI till they close our mouths
And hold our noses, blood

[Verse 6]
Fuck, I got what you want
You can let that hair down
Put them bags in the trunk
Baby, hit me when your shift done
I'll be right there
Man, they got you going ghost on me
That end right here
So don't leave this fucking line dry
When you know I'm trying to hear from you
Girl, you got that grown-man-cry
But know I can't drop a tear for you, no
Who you want?
Still on that nigga, huh?
We can make millions
You might regret me
Cause you won't forget me
