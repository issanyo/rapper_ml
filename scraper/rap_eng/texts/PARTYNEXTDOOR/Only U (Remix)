[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Popcaan]
Party
Only you
A that me a tell you, you hear?

[Verse 1: Popcaan]
Hoii!
Me only want your body, me no want no other one
A that me a tell you, gyal
Your pussy fatter than the Bimmer key inna mi hand
A that me a tell you, gyal
Make me give you a small tour of the Caribbean
A that me a tell you, gyal
Come make we have some make up sex inna the van
A that me a tell you, gyal
You know me hate when you scream and fight
Make me whine up on your body weh clean and tight
Your friends always a tell you me nah move right
And you unhappy every time you deh home at night
Me know say you no unhappy, you deh home and a dream 'bout me
No man weh you have never yet real like me
Babe, don't cry when me leave out
Fuck anything weh your friend dem a speak 'bout me

[Chorus: Popcaan]
Only you
Only you, yeah
Only you
Only you, yeah

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Nobody gon' catch my eye
Girl it's only you and I
Believe me babe
No gyal gonna get my love
No gyal gonna get no hope
Believe me babe
Why lie about the way I feel about my baby?
My little baby
Uh, the kissin' ain't nothin' without the passion
All I see talkin' and I need action
No get me no half cause I don't need no fraction
Just want to wake up in the mornin' with you beside me
With all of our problems behind me
It was like yesterday you were my baby
And now you could dance with anybody
Because you think I'm with anybody
Mi body can't do it just for anybody
Mi body can't lose just anybody
I only want...

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Yeah, baby it's only you
Yeah, baby it's only you
Yeah, baby it's only you, oh
Nobody catch my eye
Girl it's only you and I
Believe me, babe
No gyal ago get my love
No gyal ago get no trust
Trust me nuh

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Woah yeah
Woah yeah
Woah yeah
Woah yeah
