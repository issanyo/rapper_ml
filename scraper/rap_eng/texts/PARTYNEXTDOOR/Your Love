[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Girl
We should skip the foreplay and get straight to it
Your love, your love, your love
Got me high right now, you classy, but nasty
Girl I know, I can’t lie, no I won’t lie
I need your love, I need your love

[Chorus x3]
I need more
I need more
I need more
I need more
I need more, more for sure
I need more
I need more

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Droppin the top, when we roll thru’ the city, roll thru’ the city
I’m slowly caressing your body
Pop it for me, relive all your fantasies
Take it off and let me see, let me see
I’m loving your body, yeah

[Chorus x3]
I need more
I need more
I need more
I need more
I need more, more for sure
I need more
I need more
