[Verse 1]
Never meant to cause you trouble
Never meant to cause you pain
I never knew it'd play out this way
Maybe one more time of a good time
And you might change your mind
You might not feel the same
Might not love me again

[Chorus]
Love me again
You might love me again
You might love me again, no
You might love me again
You might love me, ooh
You might love me again, oh, oh
You might love me again

[Verse 2]
I need you to see my eyes
So now that I can tell you different
I need you to see my side
So you can see what it is and what it isn't
I'm not vindictive, baby, please don't resent me
Baby, please, I want you to love me again
Again and again and again

[Chorus]
Love me again
I won't make the same mistakes again
Love me again
You might love me again, no
You might love me again
You might love me, ooh
You might love me again, oh, oh
You might love me again

[Bridge]
It's too late to be friends
Last week out of town, make us proud
Won't let us tell you, yeah yeah yeah
Pushin' my pride to the side
I'm keepin' hope alive
In case you might love me again
Again
Love me gain, again
Love me again
Love, love
A shame, I done hoped and prayed that you

[Chorus]
You might love me again, no
You might love me again
You might love me, ooh
You might love me again, oh, oh
You might love me again

[Outro]
Oh love, love me again
