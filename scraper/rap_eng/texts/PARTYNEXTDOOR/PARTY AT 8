[Verse 1]
3 AM, woah, still at work making money I won't let you blow
Fast, cash, big pocket
And my nigga got a job at NASA working with a rocket
Ass thick a bad lil' bitch, attitude stuck on rude, bitch
Pussy, tight, huge, lips, pussy wet like South Beach
Call my dick a cruise ship
I'm in Balmain everyday, Balmain all day
I'm a D-boy with the tints, make that P.O. have to squint

[Hook]
I'mma sing to these hoes some
I hit the gin then we smoke
Fuck the hookah I need real wrappers
Fuck fake diamonds I need real diamonds
Fuck your plug I need a real, pill
Come get money with the real

[Verse 2]
6 AM, woah, still at work making money, I won't let you blow
Still at work making money I won't let you blow
I'm greedy I need eeny, meeny, miny, I need mo'
Pimp daddy, lil' mama
I'm not into long sentences get to the comma
Big pockets, wire transfers
Why the fuck the bottle girls more fire than the dancers?
Shout out to the swipers, pop more bottles with the scammers
Ain't no tricking ain't no hoe gon' call me Santa
My flag red and white

[Hook]

Fuck the hookah, I need real wrappers
Fuck fake diamonds, I need real diamonds
Fuck your plug I need a real pill

I hit the gin then we smoke
