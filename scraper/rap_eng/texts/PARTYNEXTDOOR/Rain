[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Hunnid dollar bills, I'ma make it rain on you
Couple hunnid dollar bills (couple hunnid dollar bills)
Fuckin' with the real, she ain't fucked with me before
Now she fuckin' with the real (now she fuckin' with the real)
Say you wanna chill
Baby, I been doin' boss things in an' out of town
Say I gotta go, before I leave, I beat her down
Love young Khalifa 'cause her nigga, he a clown
Baby, I can take you out an' I can show you 'round
Meet important people, won't you tell me how it sound?
Sayin' when I met you, you was lost, now you found
Blow the smoke out (PARTY), we in the clouds

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I make it rain like a hurricane-cane
I make it rain like a hurricane-cane
I make it rain, yeah, like a hurricane-cane
I make it rain, wet, wet

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Wet, wet, wet, drip, drip, get naked wet
Hm, upset 'cause we got all that drippin'
Aw, my bed clock still tickin'
Find the clock on me and he trippin'
Because I took the baddest broad and I du-du-du-du
White Liquor neck 'em, told 'em i'm puttin' 'em up
Told 'em I'm puttin' 'em up, big bands, get it ridiculous
And the way that she bad, ridiculous
I'm PARTY, baby, finna give you the dick
Finna get lit, on lit, get me bitches on bitches
Bitch I'm tipsy, you gotta love it, uh, I know you love it
Bitches love bein' called bitches, especially when

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I make it rain like a hurricane-cane
I make it rain like a hurricane-cane
I make it rain, yeah, like a hurricane-cane
I make it rain, wet, wet
