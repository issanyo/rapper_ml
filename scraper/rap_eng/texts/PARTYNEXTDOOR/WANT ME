[Intro]
Manchester girl, London girl
Spending time here with me
But I got things to do back home
Nobody wants to be alone

[Verse]
Just let me leave, baby (Yeah)
I wanna leave, baby
I'm K-Ci, I'm young Jodeci, baby
Love you down, baby, from the underground, baby
This a uptown, this that west side, best side
This that, fuck the rest side
I'm still going going running running coming (Hey)
There's no fun in always running something (Yeah, yeah)
Open your legsm now you see your body, body
Give me direction, show me you got it

[Chorus]
I wanna feel like you want me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, ooh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Skrrt, skrrt)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna feel like you want me (Ooh, ooh)
Oh, I wanna feel, I wanna feel

[Post-Chorus]
Got it good, got it got it got it good, got it good
Got it got it good
Shawty you got it good
Got it got it got it good
Got it got it got it good
Got it good
Got it got it good
Shawty you got it good

[Outro]
I'm still going going running running coming
There's no fun in always running something
Open your legs, girl you see your body, body
Give me directions show me you got it
Act like you want me (Yeah)
