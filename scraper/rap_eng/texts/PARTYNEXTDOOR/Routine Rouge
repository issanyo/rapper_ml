[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Five in the A.M., pourin' these shots of wine
No parents allowed, turn off the stars and the clouds
We smoke and foggin' around
Phone calls go straight to the pound
We talkin' pound after wooo
We talkin' pound after the pound

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Turn my suite into the club
You gon' have to wait up for me
Sextape selfies, don't be selfish
You gon' have to play that for me
Can you feel it, baby? Can you feel it?
You gon' have to wait up for me
Girl don't you know PARTY?
You gon' have to play that for me

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Five in the A.M., pourin' these shots of wine
No parents allowed, turn off the stars and the clouds
We smoke and foggin' around
Phone calls go straight to the pound
We talkin' pound after...
We talkin' pound after the pound
Pound after the pound
Pound after the pound

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Shawty know I'm trappin' pounds, nigga, blow it down
Bust it open, I got paper, what you playin' for?
And that pussy, I'ma pound it
She want a young rich nigga got so many racks, can't count it
Trap pounds, trap pounds, I serve all around
When I come to your town I'ma lay it down
Got a bitch on a bitch, and I want to know about
She spit on the dick
She gon' turn to a freak
Pop a perc, can you feel it?

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Five in the A.M., pourin' these shots of wine
No parents allowed, turn off the stars and the clouds
We smoke and foggin' around
Phone calls go straight to the pound
We talkin' pound after...
We talkin' pound after the pound
Pound after the pound
Pound after the pound

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Pound after pound, I take a fade in it
She told me, "Don't stop," so I stay in it
"Ain't no nigga been this deep," that's what she told me
When we're done all you wanna do is hold me
I ain't finished, from the kitchen to the bed
You gon' have to keep up with me
I don't mind if you stay
But you're gon' have to wait up for me
Do you feel it, baby? Can you feel it?
Shot after shot got us faded
Girl you look amazing when you're naked
Stop playin' with it, come give it to me

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Ty Dolla $ign]
Five in the A.M., pourin' these shots of wine
No parents allowed, turn off the stars and the clouds
We smoke and foggin' around
Phone calls go straight to the pound
We talkin' pound after...
We talkin' pound after the pound
Pound after the pound
Pound after the pound
