[Intro]
Tell me should a real nigga feel this way, Cause I've been already gone, baby
Smoking and I'm drinking strong, baby
I try to play numb to shit like this
But I'm cool, cause this isn't love
We all have obsessions, oh, sometimes, sometimes

[Bridge]
'Cause when I'm on the road, I be on the road (check it)
I mean you can hold me down, but I'm not to hold (we flexin')
Ridin' with my niggas we the ones they chose
Runnin' through the city like, "I know you know!"
Yeah, my name is PARTY and the trigger finger function (yeah)
Silly nigga might lose his life on assumption (yeah)
Young nigga from the city
Ain't shit pretty, but my bitch and my mama
Anyone can get the drama (the Dalai Lama)
Strippers in the club and my cup's half empty (I know you wanna)
Ridin' with my niggas, 'cause my niggas understand me
Still on plan A, pussy niggas on plan B
Just a young rich nigga, you don't have to understand me forever
'Cause when I'm on the road, I be on the road (check it)
I mean you can hold me down, but I'm not to hold (we flexin')
Ridin' with my niggas we the ones they chose
Runnin' through the city like, "I know you know!"
Yeah, my name is PARTY and the trigger finger function (yeah)
Silly nigga might lose his life on assumption (yeah)
Young nigga from the city
Ain't shit pretty, but my bitch and my mama
Anyone can get the drama (the Dalai Lama)
Strippers in the club and my cup's half empty (I know you wanna)
Ridin' with my niggas, 'cause my niggas understand me
Still on plan A, pussy niggas on plan B
Just a young rich nigga, you don't have to understand me forever

[Verse]
Baby, can you hear that?
This story that you going with tonight
You gone tell that shit for life
I don't want it just tonight, I want forever
I don't only want that shit tonight, I want that shit forever
You can make the story better, make it last forever
I ain't only wanna fuck tonight, baby, it's whatever
Tell me baby if I fuck you right, can I fuck forever?
Tell me should a real nigga feel this way
Tell me doesn't anyone feel this way
Tell me doesn't anyone feel this way
Tell me should a real nigga feel this way
(Let me know when he gone, baby
Smoking and I'm drinking strong, baby
Leaning and I'm living long, baby)
Cause niggas only singing songs, baby
I'm true to you, I'm true to these words
Baby, get it through to you
How I'm getting through cause I'm concerned, baby
Is it true to you? How's it feel with me?
This story that you gone make tonight
You gone tell that shit for life
I don't want it just tonight, I want forever

[Outro]
Strippers in the club and my cup's half empty
You know I'm riding with my niggas, cause my niggas understand me
You know I'm still on plan A, pussy niggas on plan B
And I'm just a young rich nigga, you don't have to understand me forever
