[Verse 1]
(Oh)
Sitting court side, to the game she play
I'm chilling most times, but I blame the DJ
She the dark-skin chick with a light-skin crew
Her pretty face and 'em high heel shoes
Got love for them niggas, we got love for you too (I know)
See my car is out there, and your girls inside
Stop tripping, we just going for a ride
Find my niggas if they tryna leave too

[Chorus]
Either way
Why you letting them think for you?
When you're a grown ass woman
Baby, you're a grown ass woman
Why you letting them think for you
When you a grown ass woman
Baby, you a grown ass woman
Why they doing the thinking for you?
Noo, why they doing the thinking for you
(Tell me, baby)

[Verse 2]
She wants drop tops, hair blowing in the wind
Must be the liquor cause it's place she never been
"Oh, and pour it up" she said
"Oh, and pour it up" she said
She tryna leave with me, tryna leave with her
But she with her friends, yeah, handful of girls
Homie, she fly
Blowing grams, I'm tree high
She fly like G-5
I see your friends tryna tell you how you need to stay back (Oh, yeah)
Girl you see the player got a plan, and you know you need that

[Chorus]
Either way
Why you letting them think for you?
When you're a grown ass woman
Baby, you're a grown ass woman
Why you letting them think for you
When you a grown ass woman
Baby, you a grown ass woman
Why they doing the thinking for you?
Noo, why they doing the thinking for you
(Tell me, baby)

[Outro]
Yeah, I know you know
All my niggas in the V.I.'
Still bumpin' Aaliyah baby
And you rocking with a G now baby
Baby no games at all, no
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ohh, without you
Ohh, without you
Ohh, without you
Ohh, without you
Ohh, without you
Baby no games at all, no
