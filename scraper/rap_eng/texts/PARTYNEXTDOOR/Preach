[Verse 1: Ty Loon]
Just got back from Wireless
Seeing Drake bring out Skepta man I swear that shits so inspiring
In front of a crowd 50 thousand
Thinking, soon, one day...maybe this could be me
But I still got work to do
Still in the 12 with my woes
Lately been getting money on the low
Niggas be talking bout me so they don't say my name so how am I meant to know
You fuck with the best rapper; don't even know
I'm one step ahead had to switch up the flow
If you work hard for everything you earn then my nigga you'd better let that shit show
She got long legs like Rihanna
And a body like Teyana...
Wardrobe is full of designer, and I just wanna get behind her
She said I'm wavey I had to agree
She Ain't a stranger to being on her knees
She said she was out blowing balloons but she came out and ended up blowing on me, preach

[Hook: Ty Loon & Kehlani]

Young nigga preach

Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach
Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Still in Los Angeles, still tryna make it all happen
Most people won't understand it
Lucky I got me one out here sailing ships like a captain
I am convinced that these bitches are watching my movements and writing them down
So I stop saying words, you'll just hear me on records like...
I'm on my way up right
I'm damn sure not the lazy type yeah
A new state every night
I might just light the dank tonight yeah
None of the mob is with the play play
You know Ambr√© got folks here
Going way way way way way
Working hard until it's pay day
Something 'bout all these mixtapes
Man they charting like albums
Underground's one thing
Stadium music is how our shit sounding
Bitches be all in they feelings these days, all in they feelings these days
But we got a vision, we doing this shit cause it's bread to be made
