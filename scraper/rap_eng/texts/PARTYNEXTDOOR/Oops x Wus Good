[Part I: Oops:]

[Verse 1]
Tell you what I did last night
Came home, say, around a quarter to three
Still so high
Hypnotized
In a trance
From this body, so butter and brown and tantalizing
You would’ve thought I needed help from the feeling that I felt
So shook I had to catch my breath

[Pre-Chorus]
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes your skirt dropping to your feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kind of touch caressing your legs
Oh my
Ooh, You're turning red, who could this be?
Oh,my

[Chorus]
Oh, my
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, my
Oh, oh, oh, oh my
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, my
Oh, my
Oh, my

[Part II: Wus Good:]

[Bridge]
Girl you taste so good
Lovin’, feel so numb
Ride me till I’m ’bout to cum
I see, you are, ’bout to, clim-
-ax so, oh girl, don’t be shy
Hey Shawty, this is what I’m here for, I’m ready
Are you down town when I’m around town, I’m ready
Let me know what’s
Just let me know what’s good

[Pre-Chorus]
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes your skirt dropping to your feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kind of touch caressing your legs
Oh my
Ooh, I’m turning red, who could this be?
Oh, my. Oh, my

[Chorus 2]

Ride me (oh), till I’m (oh), 'bout to (oh), cum (oh)
I see (oh), you are (oh), 'bout to (oh), clim- (oh)
-ax so (oh), oh girl (oh), don’t be (oh), shy (my)
Hey Shawty, this is what I’m here for, I’m ready
Are you down town when I’m around town, I’m ready (oh my)
Just let me know what’s good
Let me know what’s good
Oh, my

[Outro]
Oh, my. Oh, my
