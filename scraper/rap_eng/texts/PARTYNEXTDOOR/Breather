[Chorus: Lil Durk]
If we fuckin', that's my pussy, better not give it to nobody
We started we was young, so it barely got some bodies
I just love my nine, she be with me like we family
Fuckin' with no condoms 'cause I'm tryna start a family
Gotta take a breather
Gotta take a breather
Gotta take a breather
Gotta take a breather

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Fuck her on the Temper-Pedic
Turn around, let me eat it
Flip her over, let me beat it
Let her swallow all the semen
Let me close, the pussy bleedin'
I'ma smash it for no reason
Kill it dead if she cheatin'
I won't share 'cause I'm greedy
His and hers, yeah, we eatin'
Khaki bag to the needy
Shawty super, super ready, ayy
Got me super, super jealous, ayy
Fly with super, super yellow, ayy
I'ma cop a new bezel, ayy
Fuck her for a lotta minutes
Take a shot of that Henny, ayy
I'ma give you the business
You should take that Henny straight
I be seein' all my homies under your pic
Don't pay these hoes no attention, this is your dick
Turn on Pandora, play your shit
Put me in your life, we don't waste no time

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
If we fuckin', that's my pussy, better not give it to nobody
We started we was young, so it barely got some bodies
I just love my nine, she be with me like we family
Fuckin' with no condoms 'cause I'm tryna start a family
Gotta take a breather
Gotta take a breather
Gotta take a breather
Gotta take a breather

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Did I hit it? Yup
Is it mine? Yup
Was it wet? Was it wet?
Was it cryin'? Yeah, yup
I think you think (I think you think)
That I don't think that it's mine (That I don't think that it's mine)
I think you drink (I think you drink)
And forget about me all the time
I, I be counting moons
I, I don't think it's too soon
I, I don't think I'm too cool
To say that I miss you
Come on, baby, ride, baby, ride
With the time of your life
That mean you love it for once
I might be drunk or be high
Either or, I can't decide
Let's just admit that you're mine
I'ma claim it, bitch

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
If we fuckin', that's my pussy, better not give it to nobody
We started we was young, so it barely got some bodies
I just love my nine, she be with me like we family
Fuckin' with no condoms 'cause I'm tryna start a family
Gotta take a breather
Gotta take a breather
Gotta take a breather
Gotta take a breather

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
You know you mine
You know you mine, yeah
We spend the time
Like all the time, ooh, yeah, yeah
I hit you raw like all the time, yeah
We in the mall like all the time
So many diamonds I can't tell the time
I been going out, keep me alive
First I'ma roll the L, pass me the light
Under my Gucci belt, that's a vibe, mmm
All this drinking and this kissing got me horny
Put your lips on me then put that pussy on me
Ride that D just like you backseat of the Harley
Hold on tight, babe, hold me down, hold me down

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
If we fuckin', that's my pussy, better not give it to nobody
We started we was young, so it barely got some bodies
I just love my nine, she be with me like we family
Fuckin' with no condoms 'cause I'm tryna start a family
Gotta take a breather
Gotta take a breather
Gotta take a breather
Gotta take a breather
