[Verse 1]
Faded, swear to God I'm faded
My bitch educated, had her clients pay the payment
She don't need a damn thing, my bitch look like Tammy Toe
Hit the strip like every week plus we burn up half an O
It's that life that got no limits, my visa debit be pimped out
Condo out in Collin's like that nigga from New Orleans
I'm the nigga from the set, though
Block been hot since get go
Makin' money niggas makin' money since umbilical
I'm still ridin down Centennial
Real niggas know where the real strip be
Real niggas know what the real hit be
Real niggas know what the real lick read

[Hook]
And if it all goes down, she down for me
And if it all goes down, I'll probably make a mil with her
Probably make a mil with her, yeah yeah
Probably make a mil with her, yeah yeah
Probably make a mil with her, yeah yeah
Probably make a mil with her
Kill for her
Probably make a mil with her, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Faded, swear to God I'm faded
