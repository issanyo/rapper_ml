[Verse 1]
I'll take you down, oh, baby
I'm not around, I know, baby
Tips on liquor and forget 'bout me
Your alone time is your alone time
I know what you do when I'm not there
Finger in your hair and places I won't dare to say
Privacy
Can't you see?

[Hook]
Whatever you say
You got me, you got me
Whatever you say
You got me, you got me
Whatever you say
You got me, you got me
You're the only one out there for me
You got me
You're the only one out there for me

[Verse 2]
Charge you to the game, I play
Hurry up,  hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up
Hurry up,  hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up
Your turn up place ? you go crazy
Fucking you, sucking you, loving you until you cum
Beat it and beat it and beat it and
Beat it and beat it and beat it
? the corner ? keep it
Beat it ?
Got with all your plans tonight girl
Daddys come home tonight yeah
Say you coming home tonight yeah

[Hook]
Whatever you say
You got me, you got me
Whatever you say
You got me, you got me
Whatever you say
You got me, you got me
You're the only one I think for me
You got me
You're the only one out there for me

[Outro]

You got me
You got me
You got me
You got me
