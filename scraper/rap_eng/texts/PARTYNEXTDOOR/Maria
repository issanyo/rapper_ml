[Intro: Michael Jackson]
Maria hey, hey, Maria
Maria, don't you hear me calling, Maria?
Maria, girl you know you were the only one

[Verse 1: Christina Aguilera]
How was I supposed to know
That it would cost my soul?
Nothin is free', outchea
I wanna breathe outchea
And how am I supposed to face this lonely life I've created?
Is that the price that I'm payin'?
I wanna feel it

[Pre-Chorus 1: Christina Aguilera]
All my life, wouldn't give up
Was too young to know the difference
How did I get so low?
When did I turn so cold
Inside of my own mind, I believe my own lies
I'm facing the mirror

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
Where, where, where is Maria?
Why, why, why don't I see her?
I, I just wanna see her
Why, why, why don't I see her?
I, I just need to see ya, Maria

[Verse 2: Christina Aguilera]
Now do you hear it in my voice?
That I'm tryna make a choice
I don't know which way to go at this crossroads
You done taped my mouth shut
Make me feel worthless, used up

[Pre-Chorus 2: Christina Aguilera]
So tired of painting all this makeup
'Cause it won't hide my deep cuts
Eyes open, but can't see
Mouth open, but can't speak
I'm facing the mirror

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
Where, where, where is Maria?
Why, why, why don't I see her?
I, I just wanna see her
Where, where, where is Maria?
Oh, I just wanna see ya, Maria

[Bridge: Christina Aguilera]
Oh, my lord (oh)
Can you take away this heavy load? (oh)
I can't carry it anymore (oh)
I'm callin' an angel, where is my saviour?
Oh, my lord (oh, my lord)
Can you take away this heavy load? (Can you take away this heavy load?)
I can't carry it anymore (I can't)
I'm callin' an angel, where is my saviour?

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
Hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here with me
Hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here with me
Hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here with me
Hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here with me
You keep on running away

[Verse 3: Christina Aguilera]
Can you hear me callin'?
My whole world is fallin'
I can't see ya, oh, I need ya
Can you hear me callin'?
My whole world is fallin'
I can't see ya, oh, I need ya
Don't keep on runnin' away (you keep on runnin' away)
Don't run away, don't run away, no
Don't run away, don't run away, no
Don't you keep on runnin' from me
Don't you keep on runnin' from me
Where, where, where is Maria?

[Outro: Christina Aguilera]
Don't run away, don't run away, no
Don't run away, don't run away, no
Where is Maria?
You know I need ya
Where is Maria?
