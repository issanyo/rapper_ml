[Intro]
Sex with me
Sex
Sex with me
Sex
Sex with me
Sex
Sex with me
Sex
Sex with me

[Chorus]
Sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station
Sex with me, so amazing
Sex with me, so amazing

[Verse 1]
Vodka and water, and a lemon
And a few other things I can not mention
Oh-na-na-na-na
Five fingers on it (five fingers)
Hit it like you own it, I’ma hit it like I’m on it
Straight shots of the blue dot
(Shots, shots, shots, shots)
Baby, I’mma pick your poison
Oh-we, ah-yeah, you gon’ need it
I’m off that la-la
I’ma get it wet like jacuzzi, ah-yeah

[Chorus]
And sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me

[Break]

[Verse 2]
You know I got the sauce (sauce), you know I’m saucy
And it’s always wet, a bitch never ever had to use lip gloss on it
I’ma need you deeper than six, it's not a coffin
We’re not making love, tryna get nasty
Wrap up your drugs, come make me happy

[Break]

[Verse 3]
I know, I know, I make it hard to let go
Tonight, all night, I’m Monroe
Even if I’m alone

[Bridge]
Sex, amazing
Sex with me, amazing
Sex

[Break]

[Verse 3]
I know, I know, I make it hard to let go
Tonight, all night, I’m Monroe
Even if I’m alone

[Chorus]
Sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station
Sex with me, so amazing
Sex with me, so amazing

[Verse 1]
Vodka and water, and a lemon
And a few other things I can not mention
Oh-na-na-na-na
Five fingers on it (five fingers)
Hit it like you own it, I’mma hit it like I’m on it
Straight shots of the blue dot
(Shots, shots, shots, shots)
Baby, I’mma pick your poison
Oh-we, ah-yeah, you gon’ need it
I’m off that la-la
I’ma get it wet like jacuzzi, ah-yea

[Chorus]
And sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me
