(Metro Boomin want some more)

All I ever did was be there for you
Every time I could (yeah, ohh)
And all I never did was tell you I love you
Girl you know I love you (hey)
And you know I wanna be there for you every time I could
And you know I will be there for you, be there, beat it for you

Say that you don't miss me and I know you lying (hey)
Spending all your money at the aeroline
Travel, travelling tryna forget the kid
Name another nigga that can make ya eeeeh
Come with it (Come with it, Come with it)
And if I say too much baby girl you just might run with it
(run with it run with it)
And I ain't leading on nobody, baby girl I'm having fun with you
I don't like arguments
I just wanna rock this shit like badass
I just wanna know what you mad at
(whachu mad at baby)
I buy his and hers Jesus pieces thats called christian mingle
Girl your body look like hundreds
I'm roll 'em til we wrinkle
Baby ,last time you were single
You were dancing for some singles
Babe last time you were single you was dancin'...

Listen
All I ever did was be there for you every time I could
Baby all I never did - I wanna be there for you and you know I love you
Baby I wanna be there for you (every time)
Baby I wanna be there for you
