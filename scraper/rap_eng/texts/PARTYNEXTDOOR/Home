[Hook]
Bet I can make the six your home again
Woah you never alone again
Still by the Rabba and the rabbi
Still made a mi in the Mi

[Verse]
Young finesser, young finesser
I'll finesse her
You know you like my type
Your erotic books, you and that erotic love
You want champagne bottles
We pop bottle after bottle with you
I'm just glad i can make the six your home again
It's not news to you, no need to pretend
More money, more problems
Never had no time for no questions
Ain't shit changed
I still fuck those dimes with protection
I'm still on my way, I been stuck in traffic all day
I just left the [?]
Talk about me, let's talk about you
[?]
I been in a toxic mood
Enough about me babe, let's talk about you

[Outro]
Bet I can make the six your home again
Woah, never alone again
Still by the Rabba and the rabbis
Still living Mi, Mi
Bet I can make the six your home again
Woah, never alone again
You know you like my type
Take a break from your 9 to 5
Take a break come and see the 5
