[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, I do this shit OMO
OMO 'til I go, blowin' purple halo's
Call that shit holy smokes, yeah
Yeah yeah, (here I go)


[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I swear I don't know these niggas, but they act like they know me
And they play the part perfect cause they confuse me for homie
But I don't play that, no, I don't play that
Cause once the money's the mission, everybody start dissin'
But once they see the commission, they start to throw they chips in
But I don't play that, no, no, homie don't play that, no, no
I don't need nobody, I don't need nobody to tell me that they love me
And never really 'bout it, yeah yeah
That's why all I need, is some weed, and some space for meditation
As I proceed, to succeed, got my cry from my decisions
But let it rain, let it rain on me, gotta let it rain
Cause just to chase my dreams, I gotta let it rain

[Hook: Rochelle Jordan]
Let it rain, yeah yeah, gotta let it rain
Just to chase my, let it rain, oh yeah
Oh yeah, let it rain, let it rain, oh
Let it rain, oh, let it rain
Let it rain on me, just to chase my dreams
Let it rain, let it rain, yeah, let it rain
Yeah baby

[Verse 2: Rochelle Jordan]
Wanna tell you my story, throw it in this recording
Not your typical, easy girl showin' you all her colors, no, I don't do that
Color it in, oh yeah
They stay sleep, yeah you know it
I swear I hear them snoring
But as soon as this shit take off, they all act like they know it
I don't play that
Cause I don't need nobody, I don't need nobody
I don't need nobody, just to tell me I'm somebody
Ridin' in my own Bugatti, straight up to the lobby
While the crowd is waitin' for me, baby, this ain't just a hobby
Live my dream, that's all that I see, do you see what I see
All these bitches wanna bite me, but they know they ain't as icy
We gone celebrate it, celebratin' already 'til the storm comes

[Hook: Rochelle Jordan]
