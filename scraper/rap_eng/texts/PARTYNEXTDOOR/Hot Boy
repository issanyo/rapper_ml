[Chorus: Preme]
I'm just tryna bring your pretty ass back to my place
I remember you way back, back from MySpace
Need a 'bout it bitch that can bring the pussy my way
All these niggas lookin' at me, lookin' at me sideways
Prolly 'cause I got the whole city on lock, boy
Prolly 'cause I got the whole city on lock, boy
I should dread my head the way I'm feelin' like a hot boy
Hatin' on the man, I push Ferraris down the block, boy

[Post-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Yeah, yeah, and I like it like that
And I'ma keep it like that, yeah
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I like it like that
I'ma keep it like that, oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, I love it, I love it, I love it, oh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh no, no, no, no

[Verse 1: Preme]
I pull the roof down just to look at the clouds
New clique, called, "No Broke Niggas Allowed"
Smooth bitch, smell like she came out the shower
I moved in, 'cause that pussy got a hold of me now
You're holdin' me down, yeah, we runnin' the town
Let's catch a flight and treat the world like a merry-go-round
I got the ice on bright, goons on site
'Cause if niggas get to trippin' then my dogs might bite, yeah
I'm the type of nigga, hit it on the first night, yeah
Swerve life when she ask me can she spend the night here
Heard them niggas hatin' on the team, bitch, I might care
I could fuck the girl of your dreams, that's a nightmare
I could fuck the girl of your dreams, that's an idea
You know I'ma beat the pussy up, I don't fight fair
I don't need the fake love, I just need the pay stubs
Quick to cut a bitch, but never take a paycut

[Chorus: Preme]
I'm just tryna bring your pretty ass back to my place
I remember you way back, back from MySpace
Need a 'bout it bitch that can bring the pussy my way
All these niggas lookin' at me, lookin' at me sideways
Prolly 'cause I got the whole city on lock, boy
Prolly 'cause I got the whole city on lock, boy
I should dread my head the way I'm feelin' like a hot boy
Hatin' on the man, I push Ferraris down the block, boy

[Post-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Yeah, yeah, and I like it like that
And I'ma keep it like that, yeah
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I like it like that
I'ma keep it like that, oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, I love it, I love it, I love it, oh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh no, no, no, no

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Um... I'm just tryna hit it on the first night, squirt life
She just tryna ride it like a dirt bike, swerve life
I'm the livest nigga up in her life, sure, right
And I'm the blindest nigga up in her eyes, now I'm preachin'
Was a hot boy in my first life, word life
Had to move on like a third strike
Now I'm preachin', lookin' for the one with the curves tight
Now I'm squeezin', sexy Polynesian pepper girl, extra jalape√±os
Bring you where you've never been brung with my tongue, bae
I could make you fiend for the D like a nun, bae
Diamonds on me sing like they Harry Belafonte
Skinny ass jeans and some OVO MJ's
Can't go to the 6 until the record is a clean slate
Might just grow a beard, be the mean New Orleans Drake
Might just throw a party next door to where Preme stay
As my mothafuckin' keys shake

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, prolly 'cause I got the whole city on lock, boy
Might just do some braids like Wayne 'cause I'm a Hot Boy
Used to have some wings, had to get them shits chopped off
Might just do some braids I'm Lil Wayne 'cause I'm a Hot Boy
Yeah, prolly 'cause I got the whole city on lock, boy
Might just do some braids like Wayne 'cause I'm a Hot Boy
Used to have some wings, had to get them shits chopped off
Might just do some braids like I'm Wayne 'cause I'm a Hot Boy

[Chorus: Preme]
I'm just tryna bring your pretty ass back to my place
I remember you way back, back from MySpace
Need a 'bout it bitch that can bring the pussy my way
All these niggas lookin' at me, lookin' at me sideways
Prolly 'cause I got the whole city on lock, boy
Prolly 'cause I got the whole city on lock, boy
I should dread my head the way I'm feelin' like a hot boy
Hatin' on the man, I push Ferraris down the block, boy

[Post-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Yeah, yeah, and I like it like that
And I'ma keep it like that, yeah
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I like it like that
I'ma keep it like that, oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, I love it, I love it, I love it, oh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh no, no, no, no

[Outro: Preme]
Yeah, yeah, and I like it like that
