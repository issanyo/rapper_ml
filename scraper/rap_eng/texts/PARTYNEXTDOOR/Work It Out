[Intro]
Who could, hit those, harmonies
Better than me
Better than me
Who could, hit those, harmonies
Better than me
Better than me
So I tell her

[Chorus 1]
I just wanna work it
Really wanna work it
I just wanna
I just wanna work it out [x4]
(Know ya need it, listen)

[Verse 1]
I was at the barber shop
Weather was kinda hot
Than I saw a teardrop drop to the floor
At that moment girl I was sure that
You're the only girl that I need up in my life
And I know it's far but girl you could be my wife

[Hook]
And any time you need a ride ,oh
You could just call my phone
And anytime you lonely girl (I know)
Baby you ain't gotta be alone
And anytime you missin' me
You know where I'm gonna be, yeah
Shopping malls for shopping sprees
Anything for my baby

[Chorus 2]
I just wanna work it
Really wanna work it
I just wanna
I just wanna work it out
I'll be there when you need me
It's not hard to believe me
I just wanna work it
Really wanna work it
I just wanna
I just wanna work it out
I'll be there when you need me
It's not hard to believe me

[Bridge]
Shawty,  anything you want
Anything you need and desire
(Ooh we can work it out)
Shawty, everything you lost no matter the cost
I could bring the fire
(Ooh we can work it out)
I could take you to a place
That erase the grey's of depression
I'm tryna show you time and place to create the state of perfection
(Ooh we can work it out)
And anytime you need a ride, oh
You could just call my phone
And anytime you lonely girl (I know)
Baby you ain't gotta be alone
And anytime you missin' me
You know where I'm gonna be, yeah
Shopping malls for shopping sprees
Anything for my baby

[Chorus 2]
I just wanna work it
Really wanna work it
I just wanna
I just wanna work it out
I'll be there when you need me
It's not hard to believe me
I just wanna work it
Really wanna work it
I just wanna
I just wanna work it out
I'll be there when you need me
It's not hard to believe me


[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Listen baby girl, you know just what it is to ya
And I be meaning everything that I said to ya
I'm tryna make your heart drop to the floor
But I sing R&B and I rap hardcore
I could put you on a lifestyle
But the trojans got me knowin'
You just start a night baby girl
I'm just glowin'
It's the poker game of love
You got my heart saying fold it

[Hook]
And anytime you need a ride,oh
You could just call my phone
And anytime you lonely girl (I know)
Baby you ain't gotta be alone
And anytime you missin' me
You know where I'm gonna be, yeah
Shopping malls for shopping sprees
Anything for my baby

[Chorus 2]
I just wanna work it
Really wanna work it
I just wanna
I just wanna work it out
I'll be there when you need me
It's not hard to believe me
I just wanna work it
Really wanna work it
I just wanna
I just wanna work it out
I'll be there when you need me
It's not hard to believe me
