[Chorus]
When I pull up on your crew, tell your girl to get back
I'm to good with these words. Watcha Mormon backtrack
If I die, all I know is that I'm going out repping
It's too late for my soul, I just want to go to Heaven
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. I just want to go to Heaven
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. I just want to go to Heaven

[Verse]
I done wrong. I've messed up. I cry out to you a lot
Father, please forgive me. Even the sins I done forgot
Every day I been trying to get closer to you
I know I stall, I know I fall. Tell me what I gots to do
Do thy will, not my own so I don't feel alone
But it is so hard to be that strong

[Chorus]
You're the one
