Yeah
Why you keep askin' me about her?
She's not here right now, she's not here right now
Why am I the one you wanna get into it for the drama
I got a lot to say, and that's the last thing a nigga wanna hear right now
Spendin' all my days on the Eastside oh
Forgettin' who I was on the other side oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
I'm about to ride through the old hood right now
Got too much pride for my own good right now
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up

I'm terrible at inviting myself, call me over
Those nights when you need someone else call me over
You can be the one to take control call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me

Why you keep askin' me about her?
Couple of other things I'd rather do than talk about that right now
Told you about giving him chances on chances on chances
He’s not holding you down, he’s holding you back right now
Spendin' all my days on the Eastside oh
Forgettin' who I was on the other side oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
Love it when your ass speak the truth to me oh
Tryna wake up and have you with me oh
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up

I'm terrible at inviting myself, call me over
Those nights when you need someone else call me over
You can be the one to take control call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me

Yeah...hey...yeah...hey

[PartyNextDoor]

I try to play numb to shit like this
But I'm cool 'cause this isn't love
We all have obsessions
Oh, sometimes, sometimes

'Cause when I'm on the road I be on a roll
I mean you can hold me down, but I'm not to hold
Riding with my niggas, we the ones they chose
Running through the city like, "I know you know"
Yeah, my name is PARTY and the trigger finger function
Silly nigga might lose his life on assumption
Young nigga from the city
Ain't shit pretty, but my bitch and my mama
Anyone can get the drama, even the Dalai Lama
Strippers in the club and my cup's half empty
Riding with my niggas 'cause my niggas understand me
Still on plan A, pussy niggas on plan B
Just a young rich nigga, you don't have to understand me forever
[x2]

Forever
Baby, can you hear that?
This story that you gonna make tonight
You gone tell that shit for life
I don't want it just tonight, I want forever
I don't only want that shit tonight, I want that shit forever
You can make the story better, make it last forever
I ain't only wanna fuck tonight, baby, it's whatever
Tell me baby, if I fuck you right, can I fuck forever?
Tell me, should a real nigga feel this way?
Tell me, doesn't anyone feel this way?
Tell me, doesn't anyone feel this way?
Tell me, should a real nigga feel this way?

I've been already gone, baby
Smoking and I'm drinking strong, baby
Even though I'm living long, baby

'Cause niggas only singing songs, baby
I'm true to you, I'm true to these words
Baby, getting through to you
How I'm getting through 'cause I'm concerned, baby
Is it true to you? How's it feel with me?
This story that you gonna make tonight
You gone tell that shit for life
I don't want it just tonight, I want forever

Strippers in the club and my cup's half empty
You know I'm riding with my niggas 'cause my niggas understand me
You know I'm still on plan A, pussy niggas on plan B
And I'm just a young rich nigga, you don't have to understand me forever

(Breakdown)

(I threw my hands in the air and said show me something)
Remember one night I went to Erykah Badou house
She made tea for me
We talked about love and what life can really be for me
She said when that shit is real you just know
And I was thinking about you, you already know

Remember one night I went to Erykah Badu house, she made tea for me
We talked about love and what life could really be for me
She said when that shit is real, you just know
And I was thinking bout you, you already know
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me, that's my nigga till we gon'
Keeps his ear to the streets for me
Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, "I feel you, nigga, I already know"
Yeah, already
Girl's talkin' bout you, gotta leave already
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you a little help, you need more already
Damn, you need more already?
'Fore you said, "You're mine," I was yours already
22, had the Bentley 4 door already
Even as a boy I was the boy already
So you know that mean the pussy galore already
Mention other girls, you get insecure already
That was in the past, I've matured already
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already
You go to Chanel and get the rewards already
Know I do this shit for 3rd Ward already
Know I do this shit for H-Town already
Already, already
Back up in this thing, it's a go
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know
Ain't the first time cause I've lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
All your friends asking where you stand with the boy
FaceTime saying you got plans for the boy
Studying your body, that's exams for the boy
Take a flight here, pop a xan for your boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
Long flight home, another xan for your boy
You would probably fly out to Japan for the boy
You would probably kill another man for the boy
You would probably...
You would probably lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy
That's why you I ain't never got to worry 'bout the boy
You know you got...
You know you got that really good insurance on the boy
You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy
Yeah.... Why...
