[Intro]
Yeah
Ever since I was a kid I said I was gonna deal with this personal shit on my own

[Chorus]
Ain't this what you wanna see?
Me breakin' down, huh?
Ain't this what you wanna see?
Me breakin' down
You love to see me breakin' down

[Verse 1]
Girl, you don't say much, ah
Is it too much to ask you
To look at your reflection and ask yourself, oh
"Do you need me how I need you?"
I brought you to California, for what?
'Cause right now you're so, so sick of my guts'
You got me out here hittin' my crunches
You got me out here skippin' on lunches
I wanna be per-per-perfect for when the next time I see ya
Iced up, baby, I'm drippin', drippin' like my jeweler
Ballin', baby, need a hoop for your Hula, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
You the, you the, you the baddest bitch [?]
Beep, beep, put you through crazy things, baby, you a trooper
But you done, done, done, baby you done, done, tired
Baby, you done, done, fuckin' with me
You done, done tryin'
Hey, hey
Call me, call me, call me, call me, call me, call me
Hey, woah, px
Call me, call me, call me, call me, call me, call me, yeah

[Chorus]
Ain't this what you wanna see?
Me breakin' down
Ain't this what you wanna see?
Me breakin' down
I feel you love the fact that I'm breakin' down

[Verse 2]
Real life, geek
My fianc√© emailin' me, instead of FaceTimin'
Talkin' 'bout some real time
Away from me, space (hey)
Baby, baby, baby, please, please, please, please
Baby, I need peace, peace, peace, baby
They don't understand, I got a bigger plan
They don't know what they see in me, baby
Only you understand, oh-woah
Help me sleep easy like a Xan, woah, woah
Help me slip in and out that jam, woah, woah
But I don't think you see that though
I'm lying, baby girl, you stole ten grand from the safe
How I'm supposed to feel safe?
Baby girl, this rocks was for you
How you still actin' like groupie?
Why you act like you don't know me?
Before all the K's, Kylie's, and Kehlani's, whoa
Why you do me this way?
Must be how it go when you crack the Drake code, Draco
Bo-bo-bo-boom, red-bottom baboons
You say this too soon, I say this too soon
They say this too soon, but I want you right now, baby
I'ma get it right, I'ma get it right
Cross my heart and hope to die
Promise to cross my T's, promise to dot my I's
I don't wanna want but I know what a nigga need
Yeah, baby girl, it's you, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
You the, you the, you the baddest bitch [?]
Beep, beep, put you through crazy things, baby, you a trooper
But you done, done, done, baby you done, done, tired
Baby, you done, done, fuckin' with me
You done, done tryin'
Hey, hey
Call me, call me, call me, call me, call me, call me
Hey, woah, px
Call me, call me, call me, call me, call me, call me, yeah

[Chorus]
Ain't this what you wanna see?
Me breakin' down
Ain't this what you wanna see?
Me breakin' down
I feel you love the fact that I'm breakin' down
