[Verse 1]
Girl I see you together
And I know it ain't workin'
Cause you wanna party
But he steady workin'
It's me I notice
That homeboy is focused
I don't need to mention
But the attention
But I gotta question

[Hook]
Are you satisfied
With your boring life
I could, I could show you the world
If you, if you, if you were my girl
Private jets for flights
This could change in the night
Baby girl I might, yes I might
Oh I might

[Chorus]
Take you, you from your man
Baby from (but I got plans)
You know who I, who I am
And your dude knows I'm the man
I don't think he don't know what to do
What to do, what to do
Have no clue, he don't know what to do
What to do, what to do
I hated a life through a window view

[Verse 2]
Girl you don't sound the same
And you know who's to blame
Girl I ain't gonna say no names
[?] Robert, Timothy, and Julio
Girl you know I'm the one
Girl enjoy life while you still young
Baby girl I've with me is fun
So I've gotta ask these questions

[Hook]
Are you satisfied
With your boring life
I could, I could show you the world
If you, if you, if you were my girl
Private jets for flights
This could change in the night
Baby girl I might, yes I might
Oh I might

[Chorus]
Take you, you from your man
Baby from (but I got plans)
You know who I, who I am
And your dude knows I'm the man
I don't think he don't know what to do
What to do, what to do
Have no clue, he don't know what to do
What to do, what to do
I hated a life through a window view


[Verse 3]
Girl I'm [?]
Shorty stand out like a stain on a sweater
Shorty wet to the club met the New Boyz
Shorty left out of the club with a new boy
And that's me, I ain't a new boy
But she love me, I'm her new toy
Yeah she love me and I think she like a knot
Nothings what you give to her, [?]

[Hook]
Are you satisfied
With your boring life
I could, I could show you the world
If you, if you, if you were my girl
Private jets for flights
This could change in the night
Baby girl I might, yes I might
Oh I might

[Chorus]
Take you, you from your man
Baby from (but I got plans)
You know who I, who I am
And your dude knows I'm the man
I don't think he don't know what to do
What to do, what to do
Have no clue, he don't know what to do
What to do, what to do
I hated a life through a window view
