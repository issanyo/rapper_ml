[Chorus]
Ayy, I need more, I need more
I need more, I need more
I need more, that's for sure
I need more weed, oh
I need more, I need more
I need more, I need more
I need more, that's for sure
I need more, Rita Or, oh

[Verse]
Quick whip when you come through, baby, love
Lay it down in the bedroom, I'ma hit, hit like slap
Your mama hate knowing that I'ma sex you, babe
Your mama hate knowing that I'ma keep you up late
You got class in the morning and I don't care
I don't care, no
You don't fuck the same less you fuckin' to Ginuwine
You don't sip nothing less it's Pinot wine

[Pre-Chorus]
More, more, more
Show me more, more, more
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I need more, I need more
I need more, I need more
I need more, that's for sure
I need more weed, oh
