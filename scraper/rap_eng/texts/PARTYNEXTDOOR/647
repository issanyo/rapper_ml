Pop it like a can, coke
Shawty understand though
You fucking with the man though
Fucking with the man though
Man though, man though
Bust it like a can, coke

Pop it like a can, coke
Acting like a man
Don't you know that I'm the man though
They sleeping on you

Bust it, bust it, pop it like a can, coke
Hey, hey, hey yeah

[Verse 1]
I came to the club for love,
I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky
I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' fuck me
I need a girl who gon' drug me
Someone who make me feel lucky
Who, who, who, who
Someone like you
Put the fire on your chest like Pat Riley
Take you to another level, fuck the lap riding
All I wanna do is get you fast ride
Nigga might just cuff you if you act right

Pop it like a can, coke

Acting like a man
Don't you know that I'm the man though

Bust it, bust it, pop it like a can, coke
Hey, hey, hey yeah

[Verse 2]

Hit me when you done your shift
Know you were sweating hot in the shower
Call when you ready, call when you ready
Put the fire on your chest like Pat Riley
Take you to another level, fuck the lap riding
All I wanna do is get you fast ride
Nigga might just cuff you if you act right

In the 647, in the 647
Come back to the 647, to the 647
Come back to the 647, to the 647
Come back to the 647, to the 64
64, Come back to the 647
Hit row, wrist froze, 64
Need her like the 647
Wrist froze, wrist frozen like the 647
