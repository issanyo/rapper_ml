[Verse]
I ain't tripping, who the hell I'm kidding
If you planning to give this up what's the point of living
All I know is you and love, I don't think I can you and love you
I got cocaine in my veins for you girl
I gave you all of me its your turn
The truth is I'm useless I'm a mess
I tried everything that I seen [?]
But you said that you made up your mind
Now I'm trying to convince myself that I'm more than fine
Its suicidally beautiful girl
I can't have you anyplace but my world, damn
You're my oxygen
And I feel like you don't love me
If feels like I'm in love
To someone who don't love me
If feels like I found love
With someone who don't love me
Its suicidally beautiful girl
I can't have you anyplace but my world, damn
You're my oxygen
And I feel like you don't love me
