Yeah, mi nuh ready fi all dem things yet
So sweet, so sweet, yeah

[Verse 1]
She call me kid, kid, kid
My mama kiss her teeth
She say mi tooth-tooth sweet
She say mi tooth-tooth sweet
Don't make me feel like I love you
Just 'cause I thought you was special
Won't make me feel like I love you
Baby, girl, I won't settle
I had dreams of fuckin' the baddest bitch
Last night I awoke up and I fucked the baddest bitch
I thought I would be ready when I seen her
When I was underneath her
I gotta keep it honest
Keep it real with you

[Chorus]
Mi and di mandem
We haffi run from half of di gyal dem
So sweet, so sweet
Dem want mi children and tings
Mi nuh ready fi all dem tings
So sweet, you're so sweet
Mi nuh ready fi all dem tings yet
So sweet, so sweet
Mi and di mandem
We haffi run from half of di gyal dem
So sweet, you're so sweet
Dem want mi children and tings
Mi nuh ready fi all dem tings
So sweet, you're so sweet
Mi nuh ready fi all dem tings
So sweet, so sweet

[Verse 2]
I strapped up 'cause they mapped up
'Cause I need to know where you are
Can't keep following these signs
'Cause you're lookin' for a sign, and I can't give you one
Start to feel like it's mad love
That's givin' your attraction, to me
Yeah, I just want you, nobody else, baby
I don't wanna get too far
It's just you that I want

[Chorus]
When it's mi and di mandem
We haffi run from half of di gyal dem
So sweet, so sweet
Dem want mi children and tings
Mi nuh ready fi all dem tings
So sweet, you're so sweet
Mi nuh ready fi all dem tings yet
So sweet, so sweet
Mi and di mandem
We haffi run from half of di gyal dem
So sweet, so sweet
Dem want mi children and tings
Mi nuh ready fi all dem tings
So sweet, you're so sweet
Mi nuh ready fi all dem tings
