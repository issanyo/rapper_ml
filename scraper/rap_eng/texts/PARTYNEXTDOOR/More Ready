[Verse 1: Drake]
I got a triple king bed and I don't mind sharing
I got a big G-Wagon and I don't mind sharing
We can get wild like Olivia, we can get stoned like Sharon
Wrote "Take Care" but they push me to the point where I'm just not caring
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays

But I already know that

But when I’m by myself, yeah
You pop up in my head, yeah
That’s when you see the text pop up on your cell like
Come throught, come throught

[Verse 3: PartyNextDoor]
I'm flickin' my wrist like I'm a fisher
Diamonds on my chest like a bishop
And these lines right here ain't no pickup

These lines really gonna make you numb like Chuck
This time is your time
I need to know if you're down
'Cause if not, I know there's more around
There's always more...
