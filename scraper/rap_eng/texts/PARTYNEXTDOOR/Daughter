[Verse 1]
Morning after pill in her breakfast in bed
I got a lot on my mind and right off top of my head
I've been thinking about what I could've done to maybe reset
But I don't I won't regret what happened up in that bed

[Pre-Hook]
We took turns, she took turns, I took turns
Opening her legs
Them splitted, I hit it, we did it
All over again
But I got carried away
It was the last stop on the train
The plastic broke and I came

[Hook]
This is a message for my daughter
I hope you're nothing like your mother
This is a message from your father
I hope you're nothing like your mother

[Verse 2]
I put as many drugs I could in my system
And I don't want to act like I'm the victim
But I just got a promiscuous girl pregnant
And if your mama hear this, don't get offended
I got a lot on my conscience, it's hard to stay sad and honest
Because it was the best sex I had since August, everything I wanted

[Pre-Hook]
We took turns, she took turns, I took turns
Opening her legs
Jermaine got head, I hit it, we did it
All over again
But I got carried away
It was the last stop on the train
The condom broke and I came

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I must admit that I never wanted to have you
But beauty told me that beauty doesn't know of true love or lust
And I'll always love you, I hope that you never worry
I'll be right there at your wedding if you decide to get married
I'll take turns, she'll take turns, we'll take turns
Making sure you're fed
I'll tuck you, she'll tuck you, we'll tuck you
In your little bed
There's not much that I could say
We all make our mistakes
I just need you to make a promise for me

[Hook 2]
Girl, be nothing like your mother
Girl, be nothing like your mother
Cause, baby girl, we both love ya
Girl, be nothing like your mother was...
(like your mother was)
