[Verse]
Mama raised a hustler, mama raised a hustler
(Mama raised)
Used to want a baby, now the bitches don't matter
Girl I started from the bottom and lil' niggas won't admire that
Keep it on the west side, always on the west side
Never gonna deny that
905 been trill, fuck a nigga unless he talkin' bout a big deal
I'm from the five in the city man, I'm fuckin' 5 niggas city ladies
Slow it down, niggas wanna pour it now
Try to set me up now, I keep it loaded now
A lot of niggas talk and a lot of niggas walk
That's codeine bumpin'
This molly still bumping
Crack junkies still jumping
Got the city bumped
Got the city on keys
Got the city on fleek
Connect with the connect
Ain’t shit cheap
I'll be back in bout a week

[Outro]
That’s codeine bumpin', that’s real
That’s codeine bumpin', that’s real
That’s codeine bumpin', that’s real
That’s codeine bumpin', that’s real
That’s codeine bumpin', that’s real
That’s codeine bumpin', that’s real
That’s codeine bumpin', that’s real
That’s codeine bumpin', that’s real
