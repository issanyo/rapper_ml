[Intro: Rick Ross]
Rich niggas apologize too
It's a party next door
I hear the music loud and clear though

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
It seems like breakin' your heart is the easiest part
And lovin' you right, only gets harder, ooh
What do I gotta do? Yeah
(What do I gotta do?)
What do I gotta do, (gotta do?) What do I gotta do? Yeah
(What do I gotta do? What do I gotta do?)
Just give me some time so I can be a better lover
(A better lover)
Just give me some time so I can be a better lover
(A better love)

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
And in exchange I'll give you space, timin' is everything
I even seen you cry, seen you dream
I watched my mama go through the same thing

[Refrain: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
You saw me standing close
Holding hands, with someone else, yeah
Your heart can feel it all
Love my actions, not the words

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
It seems like breakin' your heart is the easiest part
And lovin' you right, only gets harder, ooh
What do I gotta do? Yeah
(What do I gotta do?)
What do I gotta do, (gotta do?) What do I gotta do? Yeah
(What do I gotta do? What do I gotta do?)
Just give me some time so I can be a better lover
(A better lover)
Just give me some time so I can be a better lover
(A better love)

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Why don't we ever grieve or ask me what I need? Oh
Situations turn to complications, way too easy
And I know it's me
Never planning you shit
Never thought that I'd share your pain
I even seen you cry, I seen you dream
And I watched my mother go through these things, and

[Refrain: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
You saw me standing close
Holding hands, with someone else, yeah
Your heart can feel it all
Love my actions, not the words

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Rick Ross]
It seems like breakin' your heart is the easiest part
And lovin' you right, only gets harder, ooh
What do I gotta do? Yeah
(What do I gotta do?)
What do I gotta do, (gotta do?) What do I gotta do? Yeah
(What do I gotta do? What do I gotta do?)
Just give me some time so I can be a better lover
(A better lover)
We got this
Just give me some time so I can be a better lover
(A better lover)
It gets even better, baby

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Pain and compassion come in fast, tell me, will it last?
Tomorrow's never promised, so today let's tip the glass
Gold bottles got us rollin' all over the floor (floor)
Threw a party for a looks, I order some more (more)
Never 'bout the money, truly I just need a purpose (purpose)
Help me make it through the dark until he pull the curtains (curtains)
Up and downs while I'm climbin' this silly life of mine (of mine)
So much pain, so it's champagne until I'm satisfied (satisfied)
Coach seats, I was just happy we was takin' off (takin' off)
Went to war, made it back, now time to take it off (take it off)
Two chicks, new twist, I wanna taste her lips (taste her lips)
Close her eyes, blew her mind, now let's take a trip (take a trip)
Duffle bag, baby girl, she want a duffle bag (duffle bag)
Red bottoms, she had enough of that (enough of that)
To the greatest sex and now we make a toast (make a toast)
Renzel blowin' that thick smoke (thick smoke)
Maybach Music

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
What do I gotta do, yeah, what do I gotta do?
What do I gotta do?
Just give me some time so I can be
And lovin' you right, only gets harder, ooh
What do I gotta do, yeah, what do I gotta do
