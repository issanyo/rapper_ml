[Intro]
That boy Cassius
You're a star

[Chorus]
I'ma keep you in my prayers
Even though you're still talkin' down on me
I'ma keep you in my prayer
Even though you still out there tryna done me off
I'ma keep you in my prayers, I hurt
Hope that God saves you
'Fore wishing death on me and you
It's not my fault, you know the truth, the blame's on you
I didn't do interviews
Empathy meant to save you again
I let you play the sympathy role too long
Still I see you're still holdin' on too strong to it

[Verse 1]
You wrong for this
Everybody knows that I've been honest
Move on from it, it's too obvious
Worked too hard to make me the bad guy
And I worked too hard for me to keep sacrificin', my silence
You gotta quit and break down baby girl
And just quit lyin'
Stop complainin', quit complainin'
Yeah, it's not workin', I keep puttin' my work in
And now you out here callin' me out and still
When all I do is wish you good will
And only work I do is God's will
I'm not the only one that thinks that you need to chill

[Chorus]
I'ma keep you in my prayers
Even though you're still talkin' down on me
I'ma keep you in my prayers (Yeah, uh)
Even though you still out there tryna done me off
I'ma keep you in my prayers, I hurt (Prayers)
Hope that God saves you (Hope that God saves you)
'Fore wishing death on me and you
And it's not my fault, you know the truth, the blame's on you
I didn't do interviews (Empathy)
Empathy made me save you again
I let you play the sympathy role too long
Still I see you're still holdin' on too strong to it

[Verse 2]
Shouldn't nobody believe you're not hurtin' still (Nobody believe you)
You talkin' all that peace and happiness but you still tryna kill me
(You confused)
It's a shame, it's a shame, yeah (Shame, yeah)
Shoulda known sittin' courtside, you learned how to play games
They don't believe you nah, I'm the only one who put his head down
On your hospital bed, you the one who let me down
It starts to make sense now
You took my silence for granted, babe
I learned no compromisin', babe
You really tried it, baby, ooh, I
The truth will set you free, oh, girl
What happened to positivity?
I let them believe that you left me, nah nah (Prayers)
Yeah, it was about you all the time, ayy

[Chorus]
I'ma keep you in my prayers
Even though you're still talkin' down on me
I'ma keep you in my prayers
Even though you still out there tryna done me off
I'ma keep you in my prayers, I hurt
Hope that God saves you
'Fore it's the death of me and you
It's not my fault, you know the truth, the blame's on you
I didn't do interviews
Empathy meant to save you again
I let you play the sympathy role too long
Still I see you're still holdin' on too strong to it

[Verse 3]
Got to move on from it
Got a little growin' up to do
Got a little ownin' up to do
If you know Party, I'ma say what I'ma say
If I go tomorrow, I'ma go out one way
They gon' say that Party told the truth every time
I'm a rider, it's my job, don't cross the line
Fuck it, never compromise, they feedin' your family over these women
They gon' put your life on the line like a pigeon
You keep on dissin', you keep on trippin'
You need to dead all of those lies to keep on livin'
And all that stuff comin' out of your mouth, baby, it's so dumb
I know it's people on your side who ride for you, but I don't know them
'Cause I was the one who called the ambulance and said you was forgiven
Even though that I was the one that was cheated on
Had to watch you tell the story wrong

[Chorus]
I'ma keep you in my prayers
Even though you're still talkin' down on me
I'ma keep you in my prayers
Even though you still out there tryna done me off
I'ma keep you in my prayers
I hope that God saves you
'Fore it's the death of me and you
It's not my fault, you know the truth
It's not my fault, gon' tell the truth

[Outro]
Prayed up, prayed up
Prayed up, prayed up, prayed up, prayed up
Father God, thank you....
I prayed up, prayed up, prayed up
Can't stop me, baby, no matter what you're sayin'
Prayed up, prayed up, prayed up, prayed up
