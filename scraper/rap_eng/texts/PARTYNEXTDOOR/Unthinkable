Babe, I'm so ready to fall in love [uh-huh, yeah]
And babe, you're still stuck on if's, and's or but's?
Oh no

Girl if I am the one to make the wind decay
And if I am the one to scare the clouds away
Why.. would you say no?
And if I am the one to make you laugh a lot
And if I am the one to replace all you got babe
Would you say no?

Girl, when you're ready
I'll be ready
Girl get ready
To fall in love

When you're ready
I'll be ready
Girl get ready
To fall in love
