[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Man I love the work, man I love the work
Man I love the work, man I love the work
Man I love the work, your bitch love this work
I hear I’m the worst, man I love this work
Man I love this grind, man I love this work
Man I love this coupe, man I love this house
Man I love this ho, man I love this work
Man I love my bitch, man I love the work

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I need a superstar bitch to come fuck me right now ‘cause I’m sick, I deserve it
What is a block to the sound, my Cadillac clean, it’s so motherfuckin’ perfect
Just human, boy you the younger one
Get them boys hundred and lots of them Fendis
I told ‘em the only reason we still out here moving and grinding to get all of these millions
I took her out the shit, come stay with me yo
Don’t waste my time, it’s too lit like a smoke
Didn't see shit like [?]
I seen niggas get bullied like Debo
How do these niggas try to talk to hijo
Hits hits from the 6, bitch
I got a fit bitch, I don’t fuck y’all niggas
Quick, better find an antidote

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Man I love the work, man I love the work
Man I love the work, man I love the work
Man I love the work, your bitch love this work
I hear I’m the worst, man I love this work
Man I love this grind, man I love this work
Man I love this coupe, man I love this house
Man I love this ho, man I love this work
Man I love my bitch, man I love the work

[Bridge: Reese]
Hey, I love it, I love it
Woah, hey, hey, man I love the work
Man I love the work
Man I love my wrist, man I love my bitch
Yeah I love this foreign, yeah I love this whip
Man I love this queso, man I love these chips

[Verse 2: Reese]
Fucked her brains out now she out her mind
Met in Miami, she from Atlanta
Shawty got that work like Arm & Hammer
Pussy sweeter than some Tropicana
You know I got it, got it, got it, got it, got it
Got the work
I’m thinking money, money, money, money, money
Money first
Walk in this bitch like I don’t give no fucks, ay
I just care about the guapo, I’m gon’ run it up
If it ain’t ‘bout no swoosh no understandin’ ya
Just know you gon’ get this work, you gon’ get this work

[Hook: Reese]
Man I love the work, man I love the work
Man I love the work, man I love the work
Man I love the work, your bitch love this work
I hear I’m the worst, man I love this work
Man I love this grind, man I love this work
Man I love this coupe, man I love this house
Man I love this ho, man I love this work
Man I love my bitch, man I love the work
