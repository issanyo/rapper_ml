[Intro]
One day ima understand
Right now it just don't make sense
Doesn't, my bad girl
You were always big on proper English yeah
Baby, ima get you back.. (I will)
I know I could get you back (I could)
I don't think that we went wrong (No, no)
I just think that we went off track...

[Hook]
I just wanna press rewind...why did I waste time
I should have cherished you...I thought that you would always be mine
But girl I'll give you anything (X2)
I feel so uncomfortable
I need you back in my arm's

[Sample]
Zack: Do you really like him?
Kelly: No
Kelly: Yes
Kelly: I don't know. It's just all happening so fast
Zack: Kelly, what happened? I-I thought you loved me
Kelly: I do love you, Zack. It wasn't supposed to be this way. Not for us

I lost the lost the Midas touch
I lost the Midas touch, you were my charm of good luck
I know that they said you were bad for me girl...but I know what we were
I miss the sex, I don't miss the stress
I can't even call  you my ex (Nah)
We were much more than that
How could you say anything less...
People change, I knew that
You changing on me, I didn't see it
I saw that we were falling over but I always thought we'd bounce right back
Like a rubber band but that rubber band done snapped
And that separation took part of me and thats part of me I lack but

But baby, imma get you back
I thought that I could get you back
I don't know how we went wrong
I just know we went off track...

[Hook]
I just wanna press rewind...why did I waste time
I should have cherished you...I thought that you would always be mine
But girl I'll give you anything (X2)
I feel so uncomfortable
I need you back in my arm's

[Outro]
One day ima understand
Right now it just don't make sense
Doesn't, my bad girl
You were always big on proper English yeah
Baby, ima get you back..
I know that I could get you back
I don't think that we went wrong
