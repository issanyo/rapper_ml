[Post-Hook] x2
I don't think that you understand
You made me broken promises
I don't think that you understand
You made me broken promises

[Verse 1]
You said you'd never turn the page
But you already on another chapter
You said this was only a phase
But I ain't hearing no laughter
And you know what they say
We'll look back at these days and just laugh
Still waiting for those days
Bought the biggest bouquet
For a smile on your face
But what happened?
Oh no

[Hook]
You made me promises
We wrote them in love
And now through the darkest days
You wanna give up
Broken promises
Broken promises
Broken promises

[Post-Hook]
I don't think that you understand
You made me broken promises
I don't think that you understand
You made me broken promises

[Verse 1]
