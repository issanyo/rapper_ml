[Verse 1]
I'm out of your league, baby
I'm out of your league, baby
Baby cause I'm ballin'
For a minute

[Interlude]
I just finished on you
I just finished on you
I just did it on you

[Hook]
Girl I'm out here
Getting to the money
Blowin' these hundreds
Blowin' these hundreds
Girl I'm out here
Girl I'm out here
Girl I'm out here
Girl I'm out here

Ballin' on you
I'm ballin'

[Verse 2: Party]
I'm out of your league, baby
Bitches I've seen, baby
Baby, since I'm ballin'
For a minute

[Interlude]
I just finished on you
I just finished on you
I just did it on you

[Hook]
Girl I'm out here
Getting to the money
Blowin' these hundreds
Blowin' these hundreds
Girl I'm out here
Girl I'm out here
Girl I'm out here
Girl I'm out here

[Outro]
That's my baby
Bet I get you wet now
Bet I make you sweat now
