Come save me right now cause my heart can't wait
So don't be late

[Verse 2]
Hello, this is JB
I would call you something else but my lines aren't free
So uh, If I fall first promise you gon' fall back back back back it up on me
It would be a lie if you told me you don't want me
All up on your chest like a shirt from Abercrombie
Told me I can lick ya, told me I can stick ya
So maybe we can kick it after school, extra-curricular
And I won't tell the police
That you stole my heart you the grand theft [?]
And I, want you to save me like a good game
All the ladies scream, my name
Saying JB, that's my nigga
But fuck it I ain't shit but [?]
Yeah, I'm on the [?] going [?]
So you can be the main bitch
Smile, face this

So baby, you know that I need you bad (so bad)
Cause I got a broken heart
And I ain't seen love in so long
So long, So long
And lady, If you come and give me a hand
I promise that I'll be the man
The man you always wanted and more
So baby spread your cape and soar
