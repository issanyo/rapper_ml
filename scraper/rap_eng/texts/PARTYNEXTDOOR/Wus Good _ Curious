[Part II: Curious]

Curious, shawty you're curious
Get serious, ohhhh
You say you're curious, oh no

[Verse 1]
Rollin' with codeine and a swisha
Shit I just might kiss her
She just changed her Twitter
To "Party-Gets-Me-Wetter"
And you know that I believe it
Cause her pussy the meanest
She don't fuck with many niggas
She don’t fuck with any niggas
Yeah I call all the dibs on mine
I call all the nines and dimes
I put on my ice and sneaks
She puts on her ice and weave
We stay mobbin' for a week
Hit the strip while she’s asleep
Shawty know that I'm a freak
Shawty know that I'm a freak
And that's why you're curious soooo
