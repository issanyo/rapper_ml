[Verse 1]
Didn't want to play your cards right
Thought I was your diamond 'til you broke my heart
Only wish you had your mind right
Would've told you hit the road jack from the start
All you had to do was play fair
I would've the king of spades without a care
And you know I would've been there

[Chorus]
But I got to turn this poker game to solitaire
I said I got to turn this poker game to solitaire
I choose to fold the game is over
You wanted to play the joker
So now you're playing solitaire

[Verse 2]
I was trying to make a full house
Then you ran and made a royal flush with my love
I was trying to make it all count
Obviously it just wasn't enough
You're my castle you're my fortress
Girl your loving was the warmest
Now you're shoulder is the coldest
I'm running out of choices

[Chorus](x2)
But I got to turn this poker game to solitaire
I said I got to turn this poker game to solitaire
I choose to fold the game is over
You wanted to play the joker
So now you're playing solitaire
(we could have been king and queen x3)
But I got to turn this poker game to solitaire
I said I got to turn this poker game to solitaire
I choose to fold the game is over
You wanted to play the joker
So now you're playing solitaire
