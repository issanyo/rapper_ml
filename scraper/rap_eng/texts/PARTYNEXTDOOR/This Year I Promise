[Intro]
Is this how I'm supposed to start?
Checkin’ in, my swine flu, I get it

[Verse 1]
Girl all I really need is time, so go ahead and let me breathe
All I'm really asking for, is a little space for me
And every time you need me, baby you know the number to call
And every time you see me, baby don’t be afraid to holler
Cause I know

[Bridge]
It’s hard, but believe me, I'm coming back for sure
I know, baby girl, that you can’t let me go
But baby gotta let me go
I just need time to relate, recuperate
To give you some great love, great love, great love
Cause right now

[Hook]
I'm feeling so unsatisfied with my past, yeah
And girl I got to do this for us to last, yeah
But this year girl I promise, but this year girl I promise
But this year girl I promise, I'm coming right back for
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, back for you
You, you, you, you, you, you, coming back for you

[Verse 2]
See girl I understand, that you want some real loving
But girl I am your man, I don’t want you second guessing
The feelings that we share, the mutual connection
To know that I am here girl, I am your protection
Cause I know

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You know you understand, that I'm just tryna be a better man
Baby I need you there, I need you there, to hold my hand
And I need you by my side, cause it’s gonna be a bumpy ride
Ride, yeah, oh, cause

[Bridge]
