[Hook]
I know I got you, no matter what I got you
Before you was you, before I was I
We saw eye to eye and I know I got you, before anybody else
Ooo I don't got it though
And we came a long way, that’s some shit people can't say
And we came a long way
Took a break just like a holiday, you heard me say that

[Verse]
I don't get jealous, just over-zealous
Fuck all those fellas, cos we got choices
Just I dont voice it, spite is poison
It’s the life that we chosen, just live in the moment
When you're ready
Gotta admit I'm faded, and my conscience heavy
[?] sexy [?] but I'll hold you steady
Baby girl I'll be honest, if you let me

[Bridge]
Shawty is this what we gonna do
Dangerous to me, just how I'm dangerous for you
Shawty is this what we gonna do?
You afraid to lose me, and I can't lose you
[?]
Shawty is this what we gonna do?
[?]
Shawty is this what we gonna do?
Nobody want to lose, nobody want to lose
Don't want want to lose
Shawty is this what we gonna do?
Got a lot to lose
Shawty is this what we gonna do?
How did we keep it so real?
How did we keep it so real?

[Hook]
I know I got you, no matter what I got you
Before you was you, before I was
We saw eye to eye and I know I got you, before anybody else
Ooo I don’t got it though
And we came a long way, thats some shit people can’t say
And we came a long way
