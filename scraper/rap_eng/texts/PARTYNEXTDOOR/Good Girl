Good, loving, feel so, numb
Ride me, till I'm, bout to, cum

[Verse]
I'm tired of making these songs 'bout you baby we need to stop fighting
When I see your face and I look at your body it leave me in silence
Let's makeup, no faking, no screaming Lil baby you know how to take it
Let me get inside and I'll fly it no pilot, you riding we racing
Honestly you that it good girl, let me lick it till you good girl
When I hit it how I should, you be acting real bad, but in public you a good girl
I'm so tired of waking up mad cuz you mad at me girl let's just stop
I want you in my bed, nothing said I just want my lil baby to pop it
Take you to the bathroom, get you wet while you wet already
You giving me head and you give me plenty
I give you this (ahh) you wasn't ready
Hold up, hold up
Girl can you take it, girl can you take it, girl can you take it
If you don't wan' argue then say it lil baby I know you can't fake it
I love it when I'm kissing down on your thighs and your legs, they start shaking
Wrap your legs 'round me, so strong, damn, oh lord now you praying
Sit on my face we can fuck with our tongues until none of us playing
Like Hold up we get back to action, I put it in slow and watch her reaction
You getting so wet like I poured a gallon on you, now we both sweat like we ran a mile or something
I don't regret none of my mistakes or nothing I just wish I would've met you quicker now
Cuz now all imma think about is getting into that girl and let me finish that
I'm finna
Give you that good girl good good good
