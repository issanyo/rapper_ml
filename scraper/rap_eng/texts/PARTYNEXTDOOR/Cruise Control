[Intro]
Put it on cruise

[Verse 1]
As I wake up in the morning, and I wish to see your face
And I long for some good lovin', and girl it's worth the wait
I just wanna hold ya, and say that "I'm your man"
Converse and console ya, yeah, that's my master plan

[Bridge]
I wanna take you by the arm, shawty, you're my lucky charm
I wanna touch your luscious lips,  I wanna make your mind drip
Baby, I'm your man, here I stand, me I'mma high on your love
With a sense  of love, I never give up, in your heart I'll trust

[Hook]
Shawty, put me on c-cruise control control
I lose control, let me do the flying tonight
Shawty, put me on c-cruise control control
I lose control, let me do the flying tonight

[Verse 2]
In the middle of the day I lost the words to say
"I wanna kiss you, girl, wanna hug you girl" yeah
And I cannot get away even when I escape
Your love is all over the place, leads me right back into your space

[Bridge]
I wanna take you by the arm, shawty, you're my lucky charm
I wanna touch your luscious lips,  I wanna make your mind drip
Baby, I'm your man, here I stand, me I'mma high on your love
With a sense  of love, I never give up, in your heart I'll trust

[Hook]
Shawty, put me on c-cruise control control
I lose control, let me do the flying tonight
Shawty, put me on c-cruise control control
I lose control, let me do the flying tonight

[Refrain]
She got me on autopilot
And we ain't really even tryna find it
But a designated Island
With a designated driver for a designated mileage

[Verse 3]
A compilation of conversations about us
A compilation of population that doubts us
And it's whatever, girl, cause I got trust
And every little thing you say, mama, cause I got us

[Bridge]
I wanna take you by the arm, shawty, you're my lucky charm
I wanna touch your luscious lips,  I wanna make your mind drip
Baby, I'm your man, here I stand, me I'mma high on your love
With a sense  of love, I never give up, in your heart I'll trust

[Hook]
Shawty, put me on c-cruise control control
I lose control, let me do the flying tonight
Shawty, put me on c-cruise control control
I lose control, let me do the flying tonight

[Outro]
That smooth enough for you baby? (laughs)
