[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Only the black Céline (only the black)
Yes, I pulled the race card, yeah
Sick off smoking (smoke)
Disappear, skrt, loping
Like black, black, black, black, black, Halloween gang, baby
Black, black, black, black, booty crack, crack addict
I'ma put seeds in the pumpkin, Halloween gang, gang

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Bitch, if you smart, you better keep it for real
(You better keep it F gang)
I say, bitch, if you smoke, you better keep it together
You be keep it together like Lou
Skrt in that new Pegasus
If you hating, you the (?)
When she fuck the dick, I think she rape the dick
Wrapped around her neck, I think I strangled it
I'm the king of the swerving (?)
On a Xan, on a Xan, and I'm in the club
Like black, black, black, black, black, black
Nigga, fuck security
We just running with a sack
Believe it, believe it, baby, this ain't a hookah
I don't wanna hit if you ain't blowing it like tuba
Don't pass me the blunt if you tryna pass me a Ruger
And I only drink white
If I drink Henny, your life is on the line like Skype
If I drink Henny, your life is on the line like a pigeon
(Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr)
My bae is black, my whip is black, my niggas strapped (hey, hey)
I smoke a (?) it's push to start

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Only the black Céline (only the black)
Yes, I pulled the race card, yeah
Sick off smoking (smoke)
Disappear, skrt, loping
Like black, black, black, black, black, Halloween gang, baby
Black, black, black, black, booty crack, crack addict
I'ma put seeds in the pumpkin, Halloween gang, gang

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
You almost thirty on the pole, you a cougar
You almost thirty on the pole, you a trooper
70 a show on master kush
I don't like the hoe but I might (?)
I don't speak Spanish but man, the Cuban links do
Do not fuck with these hoes
Ooh, hoe, ass and the thighs
She fuck with me cause I'm a handsome guy
I can smoke this Mary J, I feel so obliged
I'm a Roley stunter, I'm on a mutha-mutha-fuckin
I'm tryna hit it, I'm tryna motherfucking bat
I'm tryna see it, but from the motherfucking back
She know it's bigger than that McDonald's Big Mac
I'm (?) fast, like I'm a Snapple Cap
Black, black, black, black, black, black shades
Stunner shade season, 50 shades of Jacob
Xan to Xan and I just hope that I wake up
Shining like I just pulled the drapes up

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Only the black Céline (only the black)
Yes, I pulled the race card, yeah
Sick off smoking (smoke)
Disappear, skrt, loping
Like black, black, black, black, black, Halloween gang, baby
Black, black, black, black, booty crack, crack addict
I'ma put seeds in the pumpkin, Halloween gang, gang
