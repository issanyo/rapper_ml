[Hook]
Fucking with you, fucking with you
I like fucking with you
Fucking with you, fucking with you
I like, I like fucking with you

[Verse 1]
I like fucking with you
Things you do when you cross my mind, things you for the dollar sign (Ohhh)
I can't control [?] don't know the motive for these things
I want your love, everything
Asking me questions like, where have I been, but, where have you been?
Girl you still [?]
Girl you still [?]
I think you're immaculate, you never so passion
[?]

[Hook]
Cos I love
Fucking with you, fucking with you
I like fucking with you
Fucking with you, fucking with you
I like, I like fucking with you
Fucking with you, fucking with you
I like, I like fucking with you
Fucking with you, fucking with you
Shawty, I like fucking with you
Fucking with you, fucking with you
I like, I like

[Outro]
Ain't playin' with you
All day, all night
All time, everytime
West side, you know where to find me
You know where to find me
Cos' I'm tryna fuck you
