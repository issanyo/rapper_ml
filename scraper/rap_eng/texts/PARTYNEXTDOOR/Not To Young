[Hook: Jahron B.]
Love is serious, love is dangerous
I means trust, I get that much
I've been hurt before, more and more
But our love is real
She's what my heart beats for

[Chorus: Jahron B.]
I'm not too young to know what I like
I'm not too young to like dinner and a candle light
I'm not too young, I ain't too young for nothin'
Kissin' and huggin' under the moon
I'm not too young to say how I love you
I am young, but i'm not confused
I am young, but i'm not confused
I am young, but i'm not confused about love

[Verse 1: Jahron B.]
I ain't confused baby girl, i'm in that right mind
You is that right size with those light eyes
I'm like "I," I can't even maintain it
You know what I want to do
And you see what I want to do
We can keep that between me and you
And we can do what couples do
One night, on our honeymoon
But right now we can chill and watch movies up on the couch
When I touch you man I say "Ouch"
You is hot, you is my spouse
And I am young, but I don't doubt these words
Coming up out of my mouth, see
He's gon' talk and play with all my words
But imma laugh and imma hold and chill out with my girl
Cause she see and yes I know, that we be lovin' in a different World
Let these haters, because these haters come a diamonds and pearls, then gone

[Hook: Jahron B.]
Love is serious, love is dangerous
I means trust, I get that much
I've been hurt before, more and more
But our love is real
She's what my heart beats for

[Chorus: Jahron B.]
I'm not too young to know what I like
I'm not too young to like dinner and a candle light
I'm not too young, I ain't too young for nothin'
Kissin' and huggin' under the moon
I'm not too young to say how I love you
I am young, but i'm not confused
I am young, but i'm not confused
I am young, but i'm not confused about love

[Verse 2: Warweezy]
Listen, i'm not to young to recognize i'm in love
But i'm old enough to put my baby above
So I do realize, the fact that you the one
So never question my decision, my love means a ton
And I ain't goin' crazy, cause this is gotta be
The most exceptional feeling that I have ever breathed
So I must honor thee, to keep her loving tender
Cause I will always keep you me your suspender
You got the heart of gold, for sure i'd rock that ice
And if you need anything, don't have to ask me twice
Cause babe I got your back, no matter how you act
Even though i'm young, I know our love can alter that
I miss those times we played games when your mom's gone
You and I, just alone
We both know something's boutta' pop off
As long as you're in my life I know i'm covered
We like peanut butter and jelly, we need each other
Let's go

[Hook: Jahron B.]
Love is serious, love is dangerous
I means trust, I get that much
I've been hurt before, more and more
But our love is real
She's what my heart beats for

[Chorus: Jahron B.]
I'm not too young to know what I like
I'm not too young to like dinner and a candle light
I'm not too young, I ain't too young for nothin'
Kissin' and huggin' under the moon
I'm not too young to say how I love you
I am young, but i'm not confused
I am young, but i'm not confused
I am young, but i'm not confused about love

[Hook: Jahron B.]
Love is serious, love is dangerous
I means trust, I get that much
I've been hurt before, more and more
But our love is real
She's what my heart beats for
