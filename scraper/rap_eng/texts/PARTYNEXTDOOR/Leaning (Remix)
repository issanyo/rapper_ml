[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Oh I'm leaning, 420 leaning
You know I don't know steamin'
Secrets you keepin', I never keep 'em
I know you seen 'em
See 'em in a Roll-Royce leanin'
Chick name Janina, slim like my nina
Out in Miami, Dolphin Marina
Let me fly you out where it's sandy
Taste like candy, face on yandy
No V-Day, 28, just grindin'
Pink brown eyes, all Asian and slanted
Niggas all on you, I can't stand it
I booked the flight baby, I just landed
I just rented, two of you at Camden
You still got it, Yorkdale shoppin'
You’re still poppin', you’re still top of my
Top of my list

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Girl, I be in it so deep, I ain't slept in five weeks
Side ting mad, when she know who I pree
This is for the girls born in the 90's
I'ma let you finish, let me get to my
My girl, I be in it so deep, I ain't slept in five weeks
Side ting mad when she not who I pree
This is for the girls born in the 90's
I'ma let you finish, let me get to my

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Girl you know me
Nights slowly, yeah the lights lowkey
And take a little trip, got them flights on me
The flight's on me, it's on me
I don't know if you new to these things
Seen what I seen, ride drop top Beamer
New bag, I do it for no reason
'Tron by the liter, rolling this weed up
Come, jumped in the G-Truck
Then we made love when we got home
She wanna know if I slide on her when he's not home
I bet in it so deep, he ain't hit in two weeks
Then she gon' text like "when is you free?"
Yeah it's on mama, what it gon' be?
Know we won't be, not like I'm gon' be, I be

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & Bryson Tiller]
In it so deep, I ain't slept in five weeks
Side ting mad, when she not who I pree (Not who I pree)
This is for the girls born in the 90's
I'ma let you finish, let me get to my
Girl, I be in it so deep, I ain't slept in five weeks
Side ting mad when she not who I pree
This is for the girls born in the 90's
I'ma let you finish, let me get to my
