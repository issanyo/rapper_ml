[Chorus]
Little lady, come and tell me something, say something, yeah
Is it something or nothing? Yeah, yeah
You going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth
I don't know what you want, yeah (no more)

[Verse 1]
I know you're used to him
But you really want something real
Someone to keep up with you, baby
Keep up with you, yeah, yeah
Put a Range out, it's your pain now
Dealing with fame now
'Cause you're sweet like sugar-sugar cane now
Bitch, that bitch, that bitch, she poppin'
How many times did I get you wet
The night I pulled up to the dock? Yeah
And I even..
Had to pull you to the side and tell your friends to chime in

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you was joking
But I could tell you want my baby (baby), yeah, yeah
Girl, I'm older than you
You cannot play me, you a baby
I'm not fooled by the money that you got (got)
You're still Jenny from the motherfuckin' block (block)
Baby, yeah, yeah, you got money, I got money too
Just let me know what you wanna do

[Chorus]
Little lady, come and tell me something, say something, yeah
Is it something or nothing? Yeah, yeah
You going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth
I don't know what you want, yeah

[Verse 2]
Nike, Nike, I'm done checkin' on you
Three stripes, I got two up on you
Girl, you know what I wanna do
I wanna rendez-rendezvous
I got too much to lose
You might disagree, that's your point of view
I ain't tryna find love, I'm tryna find the truth
I ain't tryna do nothin' but have fun with you
Secret, I'ma keep it, all day, all day
Slow jams? you like slow jams, S.A.D.E shawty

[Pre-Chorus]
But I could tell you want my baby (baby), yeah, yeah
Girl, I'm older than you
You cannot play me, you a baby
I'm not fooled by the money that you got (got)
You're still Jenny from the motherfuckin' block (block)
Baby, yeah, yeah, you got money, I got money too
Just let me know what you wanna do

[Chorus]
Little lady, come and tell me something, say something, yeah
Is it something or nothing? Yeah, yeah
You going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth
I don't know what you want, yeah (no more)
