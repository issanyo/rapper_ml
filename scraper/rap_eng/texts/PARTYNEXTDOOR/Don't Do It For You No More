[Pre-Chorus]
One little step too far
I think I'm on the edge of losing it
I think I apologized enough
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Two shots for me, and a bottle for her lies
Cause if I told the truth, still wouldn't it make it all right
Hard to find the words when theyâ€™ve all been said
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

[Chorus]
Say I don't make you smile, say I don't make you laugh
Say things don't cross your mind and make you forget 'bout the past
Say I, say I don't
Say I don't do it for you no more, baby
Ye-eh, yeah, yeah
Ye-eh, yeah, yeah
Ye-eh, yeah, yeah
Say I don't do it for you no more, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Two little steps too far
I think I'm on the edge of losing us
I think I apologised enough
I mean, how many times can I say sorry?
I'ma need two shots for me, and a bottle for her lies
Cause if I told the truth, still wouldn't it make it all right
Still a hundred thousand words, one day all will be said
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

[Chorus]
Say I don't make you smile, say I don't make you laugh
Say things don't cross your mind and make you forget 'bout the past
Say I, say I don't
Say I don't do it for you no more, baby
Ye-eh, yeah, yeah
Ye-eh, yeah, yeah
Ye-eh, yeah, yeah
Say I don't do it for you no more, baby

[Verse 1]
You say you never change on me
Never change, never change on me, on me, on me, oh my
Yeah, I used to run games on you
Never thought you'd run game on me, on me, on me, oh my
I think I love you way more than I need you
I think that I did some things that may be hard to erase, you
Need to find something in your heart that belongs to me
That I call mine

[Chorus]
Say I don't make you smile, say I don't make you laugh
Say things don't cross your mind and make you forget 'bout the past
Say I, say I don't
Say I don't do it for you no more, baby
Ye-eh, yeah, yeah
Ye-eh, yeah, yeah
Ye-eh, yeah, yeah
Say I don't do it for you no more, baby
