Let me hit that blunt a bit, I'm tryna have fun a bit
We been working all night, lets try have fun with it
I wanna see you roll your hips, like a backwood
Dutty wine and lean it over, I'm tryna see if your back good
Tell me [?]
Better act good, girl you know I act good
I'm tryna check up on you
[?]
You know I wanna lean, with you
[?] with you
