[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Baby, sometimes I just want to know what you feel like
And, baby, sometimes I just want to know if you feel like
I should come down and give you something that you'll remember
But, girl, for now, we'll just have to wait 'till next September

[Pre-Hook]
Because kissing and hugging is so hard when you're so far away
Making love and cuddling is the best part of our days

[Hook]
And there's nine months 'til September
This shit feels like forever
And there's nine months 'til September
There's nine months 'til September
There's nine months 'til...

[Verse 2]
Girl, sometimes I just want to touch your body
And, girl, sometimes I just want to feel that you want me
Cause I know your body is calling my name
And, girl, I won't ever stop counting the days

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Baby, oh, I want you bad
And baby, oh I want you here

Making love and cuddling is the best part of our days

[Hook]
