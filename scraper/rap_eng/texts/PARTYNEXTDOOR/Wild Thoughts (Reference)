[Intro]
PX

[Verse 1]
I don't know if you could take it
Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked
I wanna be your baby, baby, baby
Spinning and it's wet just like it came from Maytag
White girl wasted on that brown liquor
When I get like this I can't be around you
I'm too lit to dim down a notch
'Cause I could name some thangs that I'm gon' do

[Chorus]
Wild, wild, wild (yeah)
Wild, wild, wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts

[Interlude]
Haha, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mhm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo

[Verse 2]
I hope you know I'm for the takin' (ugh)
You know this cookie is for the baking (ugh)
Kitty, kitty, I'ma take it to the vet
'Cause you done beat it like the '68 Jets
Diamonds ain't nothing when I'm rockin' with ya (with ya)
Diamonds ain't nothing when I'm shinin' with ya (with ya)
Just keep it white and black as if I'm ya sista
I'm too hip to hop around town out here with ya (ohh)
I know I get

[Chorus]
Wild, wild, wild (yeah)
Wild, wild, wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
