[Hook]
When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I am good with my words, watch a nigga backtrack
If I die, Lord knows, I'ma  muthauckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin'

[Verse 1]
Just the other day, I was in L.A
Grinding with my niggas that say, never had a quarter
Now I'm here sitting on the corner
Mama ain't worried 'bout water, nigga
Now Iyou know bitches trippin' cause i'm in the photo
See me yelling YOLO, riding with my niggas in the Polo
Now I'm rolling heavy in the VI, ain't no weather GI
Bumpin' through, fuckin' to Aaliyah
Look at me, look at me, or like at I
I've been ballin' now, swear I used to be shy
I'm a young nigga from the MI, tryna make a m-i
My nigga, when can I?
And man I hate to bump into my ex
She already know it be the flex
She knew me when the kid had waves, that's enough of that
You can never say I came up and forgot about yo' ass
That's real shit, look I just bought a whip, I just copped a crib
Something's gotta give, look I'm just tryna live
I dropped the weight so I can smash it in the two-seater
New hot boy, know I got the new fever

[Pre-Hook]
Pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I am good with my words, watch a nigga backtrack
If I die, Lord knows, I'ma  muthauckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin'

[Hook]
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend

[Verse 2]
I'm up first, I'm on tour, I know a girls, she's in the house
Off to work, used to run the set, 'posed to clean the house
Everyday, I was hustlin' to learn what life's about
On the way, money taught me Spanish, make it andale
On the doors, you don't want the car
They'll know who you are
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star
Right or wrong, I'mma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I'ma motherfuckin' run this town

[Pre-Hook]
When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I have goon every curb, watch a nigga backtrack
If I die, Lord knows, I'ma  muthauckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin'

[Hook]
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
