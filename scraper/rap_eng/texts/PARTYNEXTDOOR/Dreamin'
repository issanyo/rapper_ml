[Verse]
Rick James, bitch
Party like I'm Rick James, bitch
Ride around, gettin' it
Blowin' money on my main bitch
Bumpin' 2 Chainz, bumpin' 2 Chainz
In the Range Rove', in the damn thing
Ain't a fluke, baby, ain't a fluke, baby
Cause the hook game got me out the loot, baby
And I'm out of here
Racks on racks, I'm a lot to serve
So fucked up she gots to stare
But she don't hear what she don't wanna hear
Leanin', exercise, I've been leanin'
50 side of me dreamin'
Other side, I've been schemin'
Vibe with me, slide with me, get high with me
Ridin' so clean, all night, I've been
Vibin', slidin', gettin' high, ridin'
So clean, all night, I've been, I've been
I've been waiting for you
To get high, get high, get high with me

[Hook]
I must be dreaming
I must be dreaming
I must be dreaming
I must be dreaming
Get high, get high, get high, get high
Get high, get high, get high
I must be dreaming
I must be dreaming

[Outro]
They don't hear me like
See my money in [?]
Y'all must didn't hear me like
So I can get inside of you
They don't hear me like
I've already seen inside of you
Better hear me right, sorry now
Better hear me twice, sorry now
I'm dreaming
