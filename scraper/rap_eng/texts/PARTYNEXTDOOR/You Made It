[Bridge]
You made it
Girl you made it (oh nah nah)
Girl you made it
Look how you made it
Look what you made it

[Verse 1]
Balling with your bitches now
Time to hit the switches now
Bong hits when you know you faded (keep smoking though)
But she know she educated

[Hook]
Down, down, down, down, down, never had better
She knows she's been soaking it, never been wetter
Love those, Grey Goose chases
Left her dreams on pillow cases
Know you bad, yeah you know you are
But you ain't even gotta work so hard
Cause

[Bridge]
You made it
Girl you made it
Girl you made it
Look how you made it
Look what you made it

[Verse 2]
Truth be told I love that bitch
Always thinking 'bout that bitch
She too hot, ain't cooling down
Prolly rolling with them niggas now
Why I have 'em call her here?
Have I blown our cover? Yeah
Girl I'm 'bout to catch a feeling
Think I'm 'bout to bust a sweat
Balling with your sisters now
Finally hit the Swishers now
Used to sex to Jodeci
Party paint the picture now

[Hook]
Down, down, down, down, down, never had better
She knows she's been soaked, never been wetter
All you know is Patron chasers
Shot after shot, she wasted forreal
I know you bad, you know you are
Girl you ain't gotta work so hard

[Bridge]
You made it
Girl you made it
Girl you made
Look how you made it
Love how you made it
