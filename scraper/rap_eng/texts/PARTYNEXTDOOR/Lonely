[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I made a lot of money
And I don't trust these niggas, on my lonely
I fucked a lot of bitches
And I fucked all these bitches on my lonely
When I sip my Henny and I count these Benji’s
I count these Benji's, I count these Benji's, Benji’s, on my lonely
I maneuver so low-key, I'm on my own
On my lonely

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Rolling on the 6 side, on my own
Rolling on the (?), on my own
Sip that Henny, (?), and it's on my own
Just like, just like, just like, just like that
Fuck that stripper (?), it's on my own
Sip that Henny, (?), it's on my own
I whip that chrome and I crack that four
And yes, it's on my own
I make that four (?), and it's on my own
Mama raised a hustler, mama raised a hust-ler
Mama, you a bitch, you a fucking buster
You don't wanna gee chi-gee chi- gee chi
Dressed down all in Givenchy-venchy

[Bridge: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Private jet, and it’s, and it’s on my own
Made a lot of money but I made it all on my own
I said I fucked a lot of bitches but I fucked them bitches on my own
Yeah, yeah, on my own
Yeah, yeah, on my lonely
I do this on my lonely
A lot of niggas out here tripping to think they know me
I see they fake, I see they phony
PX, PX

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
They wanna flex how I do
All my bitches really (?)
I might take that bitch to the (?)
I swear to God on the Bible, listen
5, 60 racks on my ring
Put another mother, 30 racks on the other finger
Bling, uh, racks flooded, racks flooded
Racks coming, it's some racks coming
(Frrrtttt) That’s some bands coming
(Frrrtttt) One more time
(Frrrtt) Bands coming
Snap, snap that
Clap back, wack that
Smack that, smack that
Bitch, you know how it is
Bitch, you know how I live
Bitch, you know (?)
Bitch, you know (?)
Bitch, you know I got the zip

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I done came on my lonely
And I don't trust these niggas, on my lonely
I fucked a lot of bitches
And I fucked all these bitches on my lonely
When I sip my Henny and I count these Benji's
I count these Benji's, I count these Benji’s, Benji's, on my lonely
I maneuver so low-key, I'm on my own
On my lonely
