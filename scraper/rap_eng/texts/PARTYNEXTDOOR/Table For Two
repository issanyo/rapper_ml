[Hook]
A table for two, dinner room with a view
Your body's on my menu, let me eat it up
Gonna start at your toes till I heat it up
Table for two, tonight I'm gonna eat on you
But there won't be no I owe you's
No teasing you, gonna kiss on your lips where it's pleasing you

[Verse 1]
Come on in, lay the table
It's your body I wanna feast
Girl tonight I'll be your waiter
I'm gonna serve your midnight treat
What you like, a little teaser?
Enough to wet your appetite
A little taste of something sweeter
Served just the way you like

[Pre-Hook]
I wanna taste your world
I want your lips on mine
I wanna pleasure you, anywhere you want me to

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I make you say “ooh” a little more
I think you ready for the main course
A little cream and cherry thing
That I can spread below your naval ring
I work my way down just a bit lower
I wanna kiss your body right
And when you think that it's over
I'll make it last all night

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Fingertips
On your lips
Gonna make you wanna cream
Don't say, “shhh”
Taste so sweet
On my tongue
I can feel your sugar walls
Here it comes
Ohhhh

[Hook x2]
