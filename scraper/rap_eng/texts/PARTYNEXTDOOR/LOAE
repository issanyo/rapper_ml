[Chorus]
Girl let's be honest
You deserve the better things
I could put you on it
I may not have everything but girl we both want it
And girl we both want it

[Verse 1]
Girl it's party time
Girl it's bump and grind
Mix some rum and wine
Time to cross the line
And regret it in the morning time
What I said, girl, I ain't scared
But my friends all here
Can't act like I feel you
Can't act like I feel you, but
When you lonely dial, morning time
One hand on the thigh
One hand on your, aye
When I'm on your mind, yeah

[Bridge]
Girl you everything I want and now you got it
Yeah you got it

[Chorus] + [Verse] + [Bridge]
