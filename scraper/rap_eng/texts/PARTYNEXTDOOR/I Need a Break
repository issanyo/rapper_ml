[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I need a break

How much can I take
How much sex can one man take
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
It seems like all you wanna do is sex me
It seems like all you wanna do is love me
It seems like all you wanna do is touch me
It seems like all you wanna do is love me

[Verse 1: Young Chop]
Pull on ya baby girl you know I got ya
All them birkin bags you know that I bought it
I ain't trynna do no boasting bragging
Put you in the latest fashion
I just flooded your wrist now it's time to flood your ears
You ain't never gon meet a real nigga that gon do the shit that I do for ya
Fucking you right in the interstate
Mixing Givenchy with Balmain
We take them drugs and we fade away

Girl you making me feel some type of way
When i'm deep in you, you feel some type of way
Screaming out: ooh ooh ooh
Baby everything gon be ok

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]

It seems like all you wanna do is love me
It seems like all you wanna do is touch me
It seems like all you wanna do is love me

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
She like 'Sosa baby why you don't go to sleep?' (no)
I'm like 'Baby girl ion know what's sleep' (no)
All I go is crazy, you can go with me (yeah)
You can hop in my car and hit the road with me (skrrt, skrrt)
You can't smoke them blunts, you can't smoke with me (no)
You can't roll them blunts you can't roll for me (no)
Girl you can't even hit the club with me (no)
Can't walk up in the mall spend a dub with me (no)
Shawty say she wanna rule the world with me (rule the world)
She say Chief Sosa new Hercules
Say she wanna pull up on me urgently
But I told her that her time was [?] (time)
I ain't got no time, got no time (time)
I can't even tell the time (time) in my motherfucking Breitling (Breitling)
She was flexing the whole time, the whole time (time)
Actin like she wasn't goin (goin) but I know she like me (like me, hello?)
I brought the woods, brought that good weed
I need money to do good deeds
I need money I got good needs
She take off her shoes she good feet
She gimme head yeah she got good knees
She started running she got good cleats
Then she start talking bout she love me

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
