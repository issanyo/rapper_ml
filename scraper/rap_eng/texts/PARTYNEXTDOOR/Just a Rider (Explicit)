[Intro]
I will confess cause I was in love, with it
But now Cassidy's just a plug
She got me lit every time
Taking my shit every time
FaceTiming was never face time
I'm calling back girl every time

[Verse 1]
I start thinking that you might be for me, forreal
I think that coupe was meant for three, forreal
I got that house in Miami
With all these distractions, look I'm a fool, girl
Look I can't tell
If shawty feel me, tell me if you feel me
If I was broke, still grindin' like I'm broke
Would you still feel me?
If feds called and said they caught me on some drugs
Would you leave me?
If I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You'd be "Where you been?"
But there'll never be emotion
You a grown ass bitch
You the realest (you know that) recognition
I'm just glad that you know
I guess now that you know (twisted fucking vision)
Glad that you know
(My woman is not a bitch, she's a queen)
Now that you know this
(My woman is not a bitch, she's a)

[Outro]
And that woman bad for me now
Real one, in the world for me
Ride or die, all night, and everyday for me
All day, nigga
Know you'll ride, know you'll ride
I know you'll ride for me
