I been fuckin' with some blunts and drinks, a pile of shit
Think shit funny, do it look like I be smilin', bitch?
Got some Brugal and Bachata for my island bitch
Lenny shorts and Louis loafers when I'm stylin', bitch
The blindest bitches lookin' at me when I'm pullin' up
Niggas visit hoods and ask me if they "good enough"
She ain't find me, I say, "Bitch, well, did you look enough?"
I got it, that bitch, psychotic (woo)
I be slidin' in and out of dangerous environments
Every night I'm mixin' Henny, romance and violence
I just wish death upon the enemies on my end
I just wish death upon the enemies on my end

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
You-, you-, you gon' make that 100 racks so we gon' split a half right here
Just like that, huh, just like, just like that, uh

Just like that, ayy, ayy, just like that, ayy
Sippin' what I'm sippin', we gon' split that by the half
Ayy, ayy just like that, just like that, hey
Money caught me ringin' and it's ringin' just like that
Just like that, just like that, huh

Lo-, lo-, Louboutins, yeah, we don't fuck with Pradas
Fuck, they love the AP, that's a 100 thousand (ohhh)
Young nigga, tryna fuck lil mama (mama)
I-, I-, I used to be broke but now I got it on me (I got it)
Now 100 thousand really ain't nothin' to me (110 thou')
I done made a mill' ticket, told your bitch to lick it (lick it)
We don't do prom or tour, bitch, we got finger lickin' (lickin')

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
You-, you-, you gon' make that 100 racks so we gon' split a half right here
