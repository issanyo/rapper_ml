Settle down, settle down, settle down
Girl It's all over your face, there's someone taking my place
Guess that's something that I'm dealing with now
I guess there's nothing that I can do now

I see you in the city
Do they know you're with me
Are you with me, baby?
Girl you're with me baby

Cause baby, close just isn't close enough
Maybe my passion just ain't enough
I can't feel that you love me. (Oooh)
I can't feel that you love me. (Oh)
Maybe, baby, I'm not listening
Maybe i just don't got what you need
I can feel that you love me no
I can feel that you love me no more
-Me no More
-Me no More
-Me no More
-Me no More
