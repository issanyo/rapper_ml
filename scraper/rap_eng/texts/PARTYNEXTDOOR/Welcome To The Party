[Verse: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Yeah, this is ‘Sauga where the sun sets
Marijuana in the complex
Sippin' Henny cause my heart's frozen
Stunna' shades cause we all rollin'
Fuck em' bitches, fuck em' niggas too
Fuck em' niggas, what I got's to lose?
Mix my drink with some lime
Just to buy me some time
Then I'm spending it all on you
You know me very well
The coolest, oh...
So only time will tell
How we do this
The music keeps playing
And your hearts starts jumping
And your head keeps spinning
Cause the bass keeps turning up
It's 5 am
And you've just reached your all time high

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Welcome to the party, welcome, baby, welcome…
Welcome, baby, welcome, welcome to the party…
Welcome, baby, welcome, whoa…
Welcome…
Baby welcome to…
Baby welcome to…
Baby welcome to…
