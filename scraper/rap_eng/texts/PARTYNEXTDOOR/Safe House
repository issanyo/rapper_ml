Don't you play with the paper

Girl, it's hard to save at the safe house
We just crack the safe out in Cape Town
Running money spend, I'm away out
You don't wanna stay at LA house
I'ma let you stay at the lake house
I just heard you went to Drake house
And you know I heard you went to Trey house
I just never play at the play house
You know what it is in Miam, yo
Hit me when it's on, need a cameo
She just wanna be with P and dameo
I just coming in, she call me daddeo
