[Intro: PND]
And girl you'd be the reason I get by
And you don't know that I want you to try
Something like that
Something like that

[Hook: PND]
And girl you'd be the reason I get by
And you don't know that I want you to try
Something like that
Something like that

[Verse 1: PND]
And girl you'd be the reason imma try
And you know that I could never lie
Bout how I feel
My heart needs to feel
Love and affection
Girl you could kill
So I want you to use
What I choose what I use to get by
Girl it's you that I use to get by
Cause these are the days of our lives
And I'm home for a clue
Are we moving on too fast
Cause I'm really trying to make this last
It's reasons why we clash, girl

[Hook: PND] x2

[Verse 2: PND]
We should never do things out of spite
People say were different but we're alike
I dream of your loving
We have more in common
So why you keep shoving me away
Take me, carry me away
From my thoughts girl cause I be rolling down memory lane
And if you want this love again
It comes with pain
With no restraints

[Outro: PND] x3
Babygirl, I'm the man with the [?]
Would you come back round my way
And listen to what I gotta say
