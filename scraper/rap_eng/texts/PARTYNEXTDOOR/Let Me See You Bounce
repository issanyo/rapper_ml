I wanna see you
I wanna see you bounce
(x2)

Ohhhh, oh ohhhhh oh noo, Jahron B

[Verse 1:]
Baby you ain't good for me
You broke my heart & what's left of me


[Hook:]
Yeah you know that you bad
Yeah you know that you bad

[Verse 2:]
Yeah you know that you are my love and my pot of gold
My heart was warm but now I'm cold

[Hook:]
You know that you bad
Oh you know that you bad

So maybe when I find my queen
You'll be forgotten and I'll be free
Yeah you know that you wrong
So wrong

Baby I love you and you know it
You have everything but you ain't upgrading
Yeah you know that you wrong
So wrong

I need you to pack your bags
I need you to leave me be
Because I gave you every bit of me
Was it love or bankruptcy?
Ooh yeah

Lemme see ya bounce (x3)
(x4)

And I thought that you were the one
We had plans to raise three sons
But girl I'm gone
Girl I'm gone
Never knew you'd be the type to be the one to ruin my life
Why was I wrong? (x2)

Do ya remember how good I was to ya?
No man could do ya how I do ya
