[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Wiz Khalifa (both)]
I made it rain (hahahahaha, hurricane-cane)
I made it rain (woo) like a hurricane-cane
I made it rain (Party... and Khalifa, man)
I made it rain (oh, fuck, yeah)
I made it rain (I made it rain)
I made it rain (I made her rep the gang, nigga)
Ugh, yeah

[Verse 1: Wiz khalifa]
Khalifa papers, no cigarillos
Stuffin' your face all up in the pillow
Grabbin' you close and pullin' you nearer
Lookin' at both of us in the mirror
Pick you up, roll you 'round in the Chevy
Put this dick in your life if you let me
All of my niggas, not like them niggas
Fuck about it, how I'm gettin' dollars, my nigga
If you got a problem, gonna holla, my nigga
Young Khalifa tatted to the collar, my nigga
She swallow a nigga cause my dollars is bigger
And you know Party my nigga

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I made it rain like a hurricane-cane
I made it rain like a hurricane-cane
I made it rain (I just wanna do it, baby)
I made it rain ([?])
I made it rain (uh, [?])
I made it rain ([?])

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Let me get into it, let you smoke a little bit
Now fuck you better than the nigga you with
When I met you, you was innocent
Now your pussy gettin' wet soon as you mention me
Guess it was just meant to be
Fuckin' with me got me goin' way up
Slammin' in that pussy, never lay up
Fuckin' up your makeup
Make me cheese, eggs when I wake up
You an' him need to hurry up and break up
Run around the world, I don't run games
Run into your bitch, I'ma find out her name
Let her rep the gang, let her wear my chain
Let her give me brain
Soon as I put it in

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Wiz Khalifa]
I made it rain (woo) like a hurricane-cane
I made it rain (hahaha) like a hurricane-cane (man, that)
I made it rain (I just wanna do it, baby)
I made it rain ([?])
I made it rain (uh, [?])
I made it rain ([?])
