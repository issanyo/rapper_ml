[Verse 1: Ne-Yo]
Before I go to work, let me do something that's gon' keep me on your mind
Ooh, watching you walk around in my shirt makes me wanna do somethin' that's gon' keep me on your mind
So before I hit the door to go chase the dough, let me kiss you somewhere that's gon' keep me on your mind

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
So whatever to keep me on (keep me on), keep me on your mind
I do what I gotta do
So whatever to keep me on (keep me on), keep me on your mind
I do what I gotta do
To be that one for you, oh, woah, oh, woah
I said I do what I gotta do
To be that one for you, oh, woah, oh, woah
I said I do what I gotta do, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Baby, leave it up to me
Prolly wouldn't let you leave right now
Let's finish bottles of the Geese right now
Girl, you fuckin' with a G right now, oh
Ride around town, Ghost tinted, ride around town
Slowly switching up my V-neck tryna kiss my chest
Call her Rosa Nina 'cause she 'bout to clean the mess
And taste, tell by the taste
Judgin' by your past, girl, you gotta a lot waist to waste
Mama mia, oh man, oh man
All I need's a candles and a xan
Got enough to lean as you in your camp, baby
That y'all can come through, baby
You all can come through, baby
You know what we gon' do
You know I hate to lose
So let me know, so I can let you know

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Whatever to keep me on (keep me on), keep me on your mind
Whatever to keep me on (keep me on), keep me on your mind, no
I'll be that one for you, oh, woah, yeah (oh, na, na, na, na)
Ow, yeah (oh, na, na, na, na)
I'll be that one for you, oh, woah, yeah (oh, na, na, na, na)
Ow, yeah (oh, na, na, na, na)
I do what I gotta do, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Ne-Yo]
Let's go shopping, baby, lemme put some clothes on you
When you go back to try it on, best believe I'm coming too
Don't be too loud, girl, you gon' get us caught
Keep this in your thoughts when I'm not around

[Chorus: Ne-Yo & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
So whatever to keep me on (keep me on), keep me on your mind
I said I do what I gotta do
So whatever to keep me on (keep me on), keep me on your mind
I do what I gotta do
To be that one for you, oh, woah, oh, woah
I'd be that one for you, oh, woah, oh, woah
I do what I gotta do, yeah, yeah
