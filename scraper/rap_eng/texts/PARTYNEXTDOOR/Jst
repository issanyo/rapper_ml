[intro]
What if we wan't here to survive, what if i die tomorrow who would miss me huh, probably no one most people don't realize they take life for granted but  once  they open there eyes they see the truth that's fallen between them


[hook]

Tell me you love me, my heart can't be on replay just tell me you love me
My life been taking by your love, you so are my love were should we go from here
Your so close i can't bare, it tearing me down, breaking me down i'm drowning in tears
I can't go on so and so on cause you know we were mean't for each other
It got me so lonely missing the one's close to me, who i miss dearly the one's in my heart
We so different i can't bare to be apart my soul is your now, tell me what to do
I'm going crazy without you, i'm going crazy without you

[verse 1 ]
My heart broken in so many places i don't know were to begin
Just tell me
Me and you should be good friends just me and you please don't break my heart like the other's do
Your worth more then the other's two, i just realize i got more stuff with you
Your my soul girl it breaking me down just to grow old with you
Were should we take off
Kissing you holding you tight i just wan't you so bad you don't know what you do to me
