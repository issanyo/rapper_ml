[Verse 1]
Ten minutes out Toronto, girl I need you
Where's your loyalty and honor when I need you?
Most nights at work
Praying in the church for me
She says she wants to see me smile more
Come a long way, ninety miles more
I found you, I can find more

[Chorus]
Don't get too caught up with that  nigga
Don't hate on my new bitches
Cause you got you a nigga
What we had wasn't love, love, love, love, yeah
Don't be spiteful
And I won't be spiteful
I see you takin' shots girl
I see you ain't forgot girl
Don't be spiteful

[Interlude: Mad Cobra]
Mi nuh wah no man tell mi nuttin'
Ah wah unnu ah chat 'bout?

Ten haffi use so mi get di next dozen, fool!
Ten haffi use so mi get di next dozen, fool!

[Chorus]
Don't get too caught up with that nigga
Don't hate on my new bitches
Cause you got you a nigga
What we had wasn't love, love, love, love, yeah
Don't be spiteful
And I won't be spiteful, aye
I see you takin' shots girl
I see you ain't forgot girl
Don't be spiteful

[Bridge]
Take us out the YYZ
Take us out the YYZ
Cause everything seems to remind you of me
Oh, oh
Crazy as it seems and you did it

[Chorus]
Don't get too caught up with that nigga
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Cause you got you a nigga
What we had wasn't love, love, love, love, yeah
Don't be spiteful
Just don't be spiteful
Don't be spiteful
Don't be spiteful

[Outro]
I know you want everything
And I won't be spiteful
Don't be spiteful
Don't be spiteful
