[Chorus]
Girl you know I got a girl at home but you still tryna get me in trouble
Girl you know I can't drink no more but you still tryna pour up a double
Tryna get me to stay girl, you know that's trouble
I ain't no sucker, girl I know you trouble

[Verse 1]
You see the ten racks in my manpurse right now now now now now now now
See I'm draped down in Bathing Ape, shawty been 'bout nah nah nah nah
If I was single right now, right now, already would've ran up on ya
Now I gotta curve 'em, curve 'em, curve ya like a corner
I got your attention, know my presence [?]
God put me through tests
One more, gotta learn lessons
Want the baddest ones in my section
Lord I iced out my cross for protection
Purple trouble's her intention
Look at shawty lickin' on my neck, tryna show me that she's a freak
She heard the word around town, she heard that I'm a beast
What a big big big beast, run it up, shout out [?]
Money grow tall like trees and I'm tryna grow a different leaf

[Chorus]
Girl you know I got a girl at home but you still tryna get me in trouble
Girl you know I can't drink no more but you still tryna pour up a double
Tryna get me to stay girl, you know that's trouble
I ain't no sucker, girl I know you trouble

[Verse 2]
Girl you know what you doin', you know
You tryna get me in trouble at home
I might looky looky, but I only touch my bae
Numb numb numb like base
And they all fall down like drapes
Duffel bag full of everything and I mean everything
Party pack and the ratata, I mean everything
I can see that she not playing, it's no game for her
She should throw it, 'cause she got shit she got to pay for
She ready under my shirt touchin' my briefs
Get it, okay, case closed
I want a whole bunch of diamonds right now
Don't know why I'm up shawty
Probably 'cause you bendin', bendin' like seagull
Bend the money like I'm sellin' them singles
R. Kelly how I came in the peacoat
R. Kelly how I hit her with C notes
This a big house and the mortgage ain't cheap
And I don't flash what I own shawty
'Cause I don't lease, no way
My catalouge is legend, might leave [?] for one or two seconds
But it's tick tick tock, tick tock
My fianc√© don't buy [?]

[Chorus]
Girl you know I got a girl at home but you still tryna get me in trouble
Girl you know I can't drink no more but you still tryna pour up a double
Tryna get me to stay girl, you know that's trouble
I ain't no sucker, girl I know you trouble

[Outro]
Nothin' but, nothin' but trouble
Nothin' but, nothin' but trouble
Nothin' but, nothin' but trouble
Nothin' but, nothin' but trouble
[Chorus]
Girl you know I got a girl at home but you still tryna get me in trouble
Girl you know I can't drink no more but you still tryna pour up a double
Tryna get me to stay girl, you know that's trouble
Tryna get me to stay, girl I know you trouble
