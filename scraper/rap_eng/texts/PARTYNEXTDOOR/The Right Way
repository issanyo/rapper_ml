[Verse 1]
You're mine for now
Until I get you mad somehow
You're mine for now
You're mine for now
'Til I start cussin' in the house
You're mine for now
Until you start rackin', trackin' my whereabouts
And thinkin' I don't care about you
Because I gotta handle some things without you
Look what you're tryna figure out, babe
They gon' throw doubt, babe
It's a marathon and a race for your love
But let 'em chase, ooh
Your clock's still tickin'
I'm still wishin' that
Your intuition says give me permission
To be in your life, to stay in your life
I gotta do things the right way to make sure you're mine

[Chorus]
Tryna do things the right way, baby
Tryna do things the right way, baby
Tryna do things the right way, baby
Tryna do things the right way, baby
Tryna do things the right way
Right way, the right way, the right way
Tryna do things the right way
Right way, this time

[Verse 2]
We don't owe each other nothin'
But we know this is more than solo
Well this one is all about you
I'll sacrifice my rapper's attitude
Sex sells, I ain't mad at you
Get your money, girl, I'm proud of you
Shuttin' down the station
In love, so dedicated
You're my for now and forever
You can say you got a man, amen like a pastor
I already got what I want so you know that's now what I'm after still
I want no more day and after pills
Okay I know why I got to chill
Because...
I can't lie about the way I feel
I can't lie about the way it feels
I can't lie about the simplicity
Between you and, between you and I

[Chorus]
Tryna do things the right way, baby
Tryna do things the right way, baby
Tryna do things the right way, baby
Tryna do things the right way, baby
Tryna do things the right way
Right way, the right way, the right way
Tryna do things the right way
Right way
