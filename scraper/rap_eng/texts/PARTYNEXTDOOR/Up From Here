[Intro]
Yeah, yeah yeah
There's no where to go but
Up from here
Up from here
Up from here

[Verse 1]
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
I mess up
You mess up
But we still try
Cause if I'm your nigga
And your my nigga
Then baby it shouldn't matter at all
Tell me how
Tell me how
Tell me how
We fuck up
And we still fucking together
Cause if I'm your nigga
And your my nigga
Then baby it shouldn't matter at all

[Bridge]
Some say I'm different
But I'm just in love
And were going to make it
All the way up, all the way up

[Hook]
Cause there is no where to go but
Up from here
Up from here
Up from here
And were going no where, no where, now where
But up from here
Up from here, up from here

[Verse 2]
Tell me when
Tell me when
Tell me when
We give up and I stick through till the end
Cause if I'm your nigga
And your my nigga
Then baby it shouldn't happen at all
Tell me where
Tell me where
Tell me where
When I fuck up
And expect you not to care
Cause if I'm your nigga
And your my nigga
Then baby it shouldn't happen at all
