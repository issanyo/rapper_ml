[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
The summer's fallin' and we're watchin' the sun finally set
Sometimes I hear the ocean callin'
Sometimes I hear the ocean callin' your name
Cruise out of the town in a rental
The scene and the silence crescendo
But you the only one I miss cause you the only one I kiss

[Hook]
The summer's over and I feel the same way you do
Yeah, and if the stars could sing and they told you things
And you never knew I'd make it this far, would you believe me?
If I told you that I'd take it this far...
If I told you that I'd take it this far, would you believe me
Or would you see me how you see me at all?

[Verse 2]
Bluntest niggas had sent you sayin' though
So I'm somethin' these insecure niggas 'ware of
See, when you the type of guy that I am
You end up in relationships that you ain't even aware of
But it's nothin', baby, it's you tonight
Scrap that, homegirl, yeah, that's you for life
Penny-pinchin' is some shit I never understand
Just pick a place and time and plane and that's where we land
Grown words from a young adult
But ain't nothin' new, want us to have a new baby
In and out of state, cup stash up on the crew
See, broke niggas would take you to Syracuse, baby

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
