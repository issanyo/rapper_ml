[Verse: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
These days nigga, I'mma keep big paper, put it down for respect
These days, half of these rappers ain't fucking shit up unless it's coming with a check
And shit, I'm about to put this bitch to work
I don't want to hear how much it hurt
She gon' me make beg for it like her
Down and go behind, I call it purp
Six side roaming got a license on your first name already, (wow)
Diamonds looking like I'm Ice Cube in Jheri Curls
Watch that motherfucking shit drip
I'm a rock star, never sold a pack
But I sold a couple bitches in a booby trap
And I, I popped a Kylie I'm waitin
For shit to change just like Caitlyn
Doctor put shot on the patient
Shoot the potatoes, no bacon
Blasé, Blasé, Blasé, Blasé
Keep it so hard in this Maserati
Blasé, Blasé, Blasé, Blasé
Blasé, Blasé, Blasé, Blasé
