You wanna be my baby, but that's just what this dick does

Have to, leave you, right where I found you

I don't feel so much pain when you have to leave
Cause I know, cause I know, cause I know, cause I know

I don't feel so much pain when you have to leave
Cause I know, cause I know, cause I know, cause I know
