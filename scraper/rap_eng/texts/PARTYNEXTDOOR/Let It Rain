[Bridge]
Yeah yeah, Yeah Yeah
I do this shit OMO
OMO till I go
Blowing Purple Halos
Call this shit holy smokes
Yeah yeah, Yeah yeah (Here I go)

[Verse]
I swear I don't know these niggas
But they act like they know me
And they play the part perfect
Cause they confuse me for homie
But I don't play that
No I don't play that
Cause once the moneys the mission
Everybody start dissing
But once they see the commission
They start to throw they chips in
But I don't play that
No no homie don't play that
No no I don't need nobody
I don't need nobody who'll tell me that they love me
When I know don't nobody do, yeah

[Hook]
And I swear all I need
Is some weed and some space for meditation
As I proceed to succeed
Got my cry for my decisions
But let it rain
Let it rain on me
Gotta let it rain
Cause just to chase my dreams I gotta let it rain
