[Hook]
And girl you'd be the reason i get by
And you don't know that i want you to try
Something like that
Something like that

And girl you'd be the reason i get by
And you don't know that i want you to try
Something like that
Something like that

[Verse 1]
And girl you'd be de reason imma try
And you know that i could never lie
Bout how i feel
My heart needs to fill
With love and affection
Girl you could kill
So i want you to use
What I choose what i use to get by
Girl it's you that i use to get by
Cause these are the days of our lives
And i'm home for a clue
Are we moving on too fast
Cause I'm really trying to make this last
It's reasons why we clash, girl

[Hook]
And girl you'd be the reason i get by
And you don't know that i want you to try
Something like that
Something like that

And girl you'd be the reason i get by
And you don't know that i want you to try
Something like that
Something like that

[Verse 2]
We should never do things out of spite
People say were different but we're alike
I dream of your loving (I was day dreaming yeah)
We have more in common
So why you keep shoving me away
Take me, carry me away
From my thoughts girl cause i'm rolling down memory lane
And if you want this love again
It comes with pain with no restrains

[Outro]
Babygirl, I'm the man with the bad beats
Would you come back round my way
And listen to what I gotta say
