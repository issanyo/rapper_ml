[Intro: Trouble]
Ear Drummers
Mike, crazy as fuck
You said you was talkin' about what?
I got nothin', man
30, you a fool for this one
I got nothin' on no nothin'
Nah, straight like that, though
Mike WiLL Made-It

[Verse 1: Trouble]
Ain't got nothin' for no nothin', nothin' gets to me, too close
Ain't got nothin' for no nothin' ho, lil' bitch be doin' the most
I was duckin' bullets, shootouts, me and my guys design your porch
Look in your eyes and I see ho, don't be surprised when you see smoke
Ain't got nothin' for no nothin', nothin' gets to me, too close
Ain't got nothin' for no nothin' ho, lil' bitch be doin' the most
I was duckin' bullets, shootouts, me and my guys design your porch
Look in your eyes and I see ho, don't be surprised when you see smoke, bitch

[Chorus: Trouble & The Weeknd]
Yeah, come through, yeah
What time you want a young nigga to come through?
What time you want a nigga to come? (Yeah)
You just want a young nigga to come through (yeah)
Just want me to come through, come through
You just want a young nigga to come through
You must want a nigga to come

[Verse 2: Trouble & The Weeknd]
Damn the bih 'bout dumb as a box of rocks
Dawg I just get them sock
Find out her BD be the opps
You can't be G and be the cops (yeah)
I can't play myself out like that
Fuck these hoes, keep gettin' that dope
Slippers countin' mine won't be tryin' get no pussy
Somethin' I know
I was down bad on my luck
My dawg like three sum summers ago
Ain't shit been sweet, but neither's me
So my bitch need 300 or more
I keep guns and ganja close, I keep funds, but I don't boast
I know what it's like to not have shit, it ain't a bitch I owe
You don't need 'em now
Ain't no fuck nigga gon' try m
Without sayin' I went in his shit (fuck nigga)
Ain't no fuck nigga gon' disrespect the gang
Or try my bitch (fuck nigga)
Play no games
Pop shit straight up out that 6
Ain't with what I'm with, you gettin' dismissed
I give a fatal Jadakiss
Always been up for fades and shit, Skoob

[Chorus: Trouble & The Weeknd]
Yeah, come through, yeah
What time you want a young nigga to come through?
What time you want a nigga to come? (Yeah)
You just want a young nigga to come through (yeah)
You just want a young nigga to come through
You must want a nigga to come, what time?
Come through (oh, yeah)
What time you want a young nigga to come through?
What time you want a nigga to come?
You just want a young nigga to come through (yeah)
You just want a young nigga to come through
You must want a nigga to come

[Verse 3: Trouble]
I was slidin', vibin', ridin' 285, just in my thoughts
Do I need go hit this lick? Ain't got no time to gettin' caught
I can't leave my folks down bad like that
Guess I'm just gon' slow roll it
Partner say he got OG in the 3, that's where I'm rollin'
Focus nigga, need to focus mo', that's Motrin, ain't no perc
Yeen gon' fuck me up like that
Step on my shit, bitch, you get murked
Free world out there in the bluff
Eastside just might see me in dirt
A two-piece snack in one piece skirts
Can't turn me down, this ain't that vert
Got off 12's was on Wee Kirk, got off them bails, you hella hurt
Got up every time, I fell to dirt, got up every time, I fell to dirt
You lil' bitches failed to mention when you gossip in your kitchen
How I held shit down since prison
How I held shit down in trenches huh

[Chorus: Trouble & The Weeknd]
Yeah, come through, yeah
What time you want a young nigga to come through?
What time you want a nigga to come? (Yeah)
You just want a young nigga to come through (yeah)
You just want a young nigga to come through
You must want a nigga to come, what time?
Come through (oh, yeah)
What time you want a young nigga to come through?
What time you want a nigga to come?
You just want a young nigga to come through (yeah)
You just want a young nigga to come through
You must want a nigga to come

[Outro: Trouble & The Weeknd]
