The mic-stand's a bit too tall up in dis bih
Ok, ok, ok

Yippy yippy yai-yai-yaw
I ain't gonna lie-yie-yaw
Everything ain't ai-yai-yaw
But we gon' be alrigh-yigh-yaw
Yippy yippy yai-yai-yaw
I ain't gonna lie-yie-yaw
Everything ain't ai-yai-yaw
But we gon' be alrigh-yigh-yaw

You got me dripping down my thigh-yigh-yaw
Push my panties to the side
You can chill inside and hide-i-yaw
I hope you don't mind
I just wanna blind my mind
Yippy yippy yai-yai-ya
Everything ain't ai-yai-yai
But we gon' be alrigh-yigh-yaw

Couple bags and we'll be bumpin
Twenty eighteen gon' be something
Don't switch on me, I got big plans
Hallelujah, amen

Cruisin, cruisin with you
See all I wanna do
Is cruisin with you
But I got shit to do
And hella things to prove
No I ain't tryna be rude
Yeah I want you to come through but I don't want you to
See I'm overthinking too much
Bout why the fuck I haven't blown up
And I got bare shit I can't pay for
And why the city show no love
Yeah we so good, said they don't show love
Not before a co-signer

Yippy yippy yai-yai-yaw
You see I ain't gonna lie-yie-yaw
Everything ain't ai-yai-yaw
But we gon' be alrigh-yigh-yaw
Yippy yippy yai-yai-yaw
I ain't gonna lie-yie-yaw
Everything ain't ai-yai-yai
But we gon' be alrigh-yigh-yigh

No I don't base my goals off a jpeg (straight up)
I just have a role and I play that
These niggas don't show love, they don't play tag
They play ghost fam
With they friend dem
And I, don't respect that
But it's cool, I promise

Couple bags and we'll be bumpin
Twenty eighteen gon' be something
Don't switch on me, I got big plans
Hallelujah... amen
All in God's timing and in God's plan
We show mad love, y'all can't pretend
Tic tic boom, now that's dead

Yippy yippy, aha

Hallelujah...
