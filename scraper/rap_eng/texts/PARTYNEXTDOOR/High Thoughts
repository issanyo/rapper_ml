[Verse: Fetty Wap]
Shaudy say she down to take a trip, shauty say she down to make a flip
Smokes money, got high off this zip
And this Perky got me feeling like I'm the shit
Talkin to lil shauty like this
Baby, is you goin let me hit
Baby, is you rollin up the splif
Hopin all your friends is with this shit
Baby, in my Coope, we can crues
Fuck m haters, we never lose
Please don't let a nigga make the news
Niggas that be with me carey tools
Baby, I'm the leader of the Zoo
Getting to the money, a nigga makin moves
Never known to follo niggas rules
I'm an island boy, I'm bangin with the Roog
Come and take a walk up in my shoes
5 million, went and blew it on the crew
I was savin money for some jewels
Went and spent 2 milly on them jewls
All my kids got more money than you
Fuckin bitches, I was bussin out Ubers
I was walkin, on my way to school
Buss, then a Farari, then I park by the school
Niggas hatin, I don't really give 2 fucks
6 Mercedes, and I got me a few trucks
7 Beamers, and you know that they juiced up
2 Ferraris, and they practicley useless
In my Auti, see me swangin with my crew
See me smiling, cause I always countin doe
Countin money everywhere I go
Imma thro it while she slidin down the pool
She goin be there everywhere I go
She goin be like, baby, give me more
She fucked around, and made me throgh the doe
Half a ticket on my watch and my chain
From New Jerzy to Japan, they all know my name
You can usually catch me with my gang
We insane, that's what I bang
