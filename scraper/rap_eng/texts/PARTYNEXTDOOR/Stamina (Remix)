(Stamina, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Big Lean]
My mama asking me for grand kids
See here what the plan is

And I’ll be your Barack
Don’t miss a tick
Don’t miss a tock
Just wine pon di riddim
While you wine pon di cock
She said it a drip till it runneth over
Length and strength when me bend it over
My body likkle, but it tallawah
Drink all ah Dragon Stout, and give her the stamina
Ooh, wha you feel like?
You know say man a gyalis inna real life
My body likkle, but it talla—
Drink all ah Dragon Stout, and give her the stamina
