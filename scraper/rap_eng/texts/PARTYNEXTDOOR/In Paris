[Hook]
Girl we broke up in Paris
Since then my heart been cold
Girl we're supposed to get married
Now just hang up and go, go, go

[Verse]
And I ask [?] fully loaded clip
DJ keep it going cause I'm killing shit
Who the fuck I'm playing, cause I miss the bitch
I'm 'bout to overdose man fuck that shit
Little did she know she was fucking with a real ass nigga
And her man said to let go, but I ain't even playing track and field with these niggas
She ran away with her love, who I though I once was
[?]

[Hook]
Girl I found out 'bout Paris
And it hurts just so you know
Girl we're supposed to get married
Now how the fuck can that be so
What up
