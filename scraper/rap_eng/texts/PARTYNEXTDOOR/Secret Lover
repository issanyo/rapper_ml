[Verse 1]:
As I wake up in the morning
And I wish to see your face:
I long for some good loving
And girl it's worth the wait
I want to get closer
And whisper to you
How much I love you, yeah
Babygirl I want you
Right here right now
Babygirl I need you to help me to figure this out
Why I love you so, so much
Imma miss your touch, babe

[Chorus]:
I want you to be my lover
I want to be your lover
Baby be my secret lover
Baby be my secret lover
Babygirl I want you, you
Babygirl I want you, you
To be my secret lover
To be my secret lover
Babygirl I...

[Verse 2]:
When I go to work
You's who I'm thinking
Smell her from my shirt
When we were kissing
How this gonna work?
I'm so wonderful cause...[?]
Girl trust our love, girl
Every thing I do
Has to do with you
Everything I say
It mirrors you
All my thoughts
Thinking bout you daily and maybe
It's love girl I'm waiting

[Chorus]:
I want you to be my lover
I want you to be my lover
Baby be my secret lover
Baby be my secret lover
Babygirl I want you, you
Babygirl I want you, you
To be my secret lover
To be my secret lover
Babygirl I...

[Bridge]:
I want you
And I need you
Girl I want to see
All your features
On my body
On your body
Hot, hot tamale
Yeah I laugh cause it's funny
[?] and I know it's pain
But it feels so damn good
It's insane, your brain
Girl it feels like I popped my hood
Babygirl just go harder, softer, harder!

[Chorus]:
I want you to be my lover
I want you to be my lover
Baby be my secret lover
Baby be my secret lover
Babygirl I want you, you
Babygirl I want you, you
To be my secret lover
To be my secret lover
Babygirl I...
