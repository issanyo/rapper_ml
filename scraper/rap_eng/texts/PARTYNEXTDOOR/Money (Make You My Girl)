[Verse:1 PARTYNEXTDOOR]
G - Go and throw that ass back
Go and make it clap clap for me
Oooohh, where you learn to dance like that
Climb up on the P - pole for me (Let's talk money)
I'ma throw these ones, tell the DJ keep this on repeat (Shawty let's talk money)
Baby tonight forget about them niggas
Come and keep the focus on me (Let's talk money)
Yeah, how low can you go, back that ass up baby girl and wine slow (Let's talk money)
Tell me how you like it like it baby
Tell me how you like it like it baby

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
If you weren't all over the stripper poles
I'll probably make you my girl
If you weren't all up in the videos
I'll probably make you my world...
