[Intro]
Babygirl, go slower than you're used to cause
I'm tryna make love tonight

[Hook]
I just wanna love you, love you, long long
Maybe we can stay a little longer
Baby, if we ain't do anything wrong
Maybe we can play this a little louder
When I get you in my bed
Playing with my drawers
Messing up my sheets
Girl you know that this shit costs
Look me in the eyes if you
Admire, admire, admire me
Look me in the eyes if you
Admire, admire, admire me
Girl you know how much I
Like it, like it, like it
Like it, like it, like it
When I get you up in my bed
When I get you up in my bed

[Verse 1]
Babygirl, you know you're sweet
Summin like sugar and cotton candy
Baby, got me weak in the knees
Probably why you will never understand me
And you're so fine
And you're all mine

[Hook]
I just wanna love you, love you, long long (you long)
Maybe we can stay a little longer (stay a little longer)
Baby, if we ain't do anything wrong
Maybe we can play this a little louder
When I get you in my bed
Playing with my drawers
Messing up my sheets
Girl you know that this shit costs
Look me in the eyes if you
Admire, admire, admire me
Look me in the eyes if you
Admire, admire, admire me
Girl you know how much I
Like it, like it, like it
Like it, like it, like it
When I get you up in my bed
When I get you up in my bed

[Verse 2]
Something that you did made me fall in love
Something that you said made me fall in deeper
Babygirl, let me get a little, uh
Babygirl, I'm just tryna get beneath ya
Babygirl, you know I like
Everything that you do
I'm just tryna keep it real, girl
And do exactly what you do

[Hook]
I just wanna love you, love you, long long
Maybe we can stay a little longer
Baby, if we ain't do anything wrong
Maybe we can play this a little louder
When I get you in my bed
Playing with my drawers
Messing up my sheets
Girl you know that this shit costs
Look me in the eyes if you
Admire, admire, admire me
Look me in the eyes if you
Admire, admire, admire me
Girl you know how much I
Like it, like it, like it
Like it, like it, like it
When I get you up in my bed
When I get you up in my bed
