[Verse]
I got Grey Goose in my system
And I'm trying to not give a fuck
Cause I'mma love you tonight
And hate you when I wake up
Girl do you feel how I'm feeling?
Baby give me some of your love
Come give me some of your love
Come give me some of your love

[Bridge 1]
Cause it's on, turn on the radio baby
I'll turn you on, just make sure you ready baby
Cause I'm down for anything
Tell me when you ready baby
Timing is everything
Tell me when you ready baby
Cause you know when it's

And hate you when I wake up
Girl do you feel how I'm feeling?
Baby give me some of your love
Come give me some of your love
Come give me some of your love
