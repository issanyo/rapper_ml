[Verse 1]
PX
Met you in Texas
I left you in Texas
Read your text message, damn girl you're reckless
Thanks to you, all I do is think about you
Another hundred racks changed my mood
I bet 2 hundred racks change yours too
Girl you know I wouldn't say nothin' 'bout it
But you know I heard everything about it
You used to strip out of east Atlanta
Probably where you learn all of your talents

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's get back to the love making
Let's get back to the legs shaking
Remember when you said you was always faking
When you with him, you don't miss him, you just distant
Oh, oh, yeah
You fuck me and say "Jesus"
I don't care to say it shawty, I need you

[Chorus]
Nobody, nobody but you, nobody but you
Nobody but you, single want nobody but you
Thinkin' bout nobody but you
Spend it on nobody but you
Takin' it from nobody, but me
Keep it for me, keep it for me
The loyalty is all I need
(Nobody)

[Verse 2]
I been tryna tell you "Come down,"
"Come down, summer's over, come down"
You say that I never come round
And I only get lit when the sun down, oh
Too much temptation, hard work and dedication
Summer came, I watched that ass get fat again
Must've hit that yoga on the mats again
I ain't looking for no boo, ain't no ghostbusta'
She gone make it clap just like the old Busta
She gon' dance with me like Beyonc√©
Fuck you till you K.O. like Lalonde
What the song say?
When you fuck me and suck me, you lovin' it, you say Jesus
Oh God, I don't care to say it shawty, cause I need you

[Chorus]
Nobody, nobody
Nobody but you, nobody but you
Nobody but you, single want nobody but you
Takin' home nobody but you
Thinkin' bout nobody but you
Spend it on nobody but you
Keep it for me, keep it for me
The loyalty is all I need
Keep it for nobody, I got it for nobody
Go down for nobody
Got love for nobody, nobody but you

[Outro]
I been tryna tell you "Come down,"
"Come down, summer's over, come down"
You say that I never come round
And I only get lit when the sun down, oh
Nobody, nobody but you
Nobody but you, -body but you
