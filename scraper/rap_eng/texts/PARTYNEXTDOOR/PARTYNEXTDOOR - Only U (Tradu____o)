[Intro]
PARTY

[Verse 1]
Why did you go?
Where did you take my love?
Left me alone
You left me abandoned
Girl cause if it's passion that you want
Gave it to you thousands on thousands times over
You said that my love get you drunk
We made love every night, never let you stay sober
Oh, you you wan fi pin the blame on me like a poster
You thinks that you a spy but me no know her
Girl if I didn't want you woulda let you go
Woulda let you know
Stop the confusion
Stop the illusion
It's only you on my mind
It's only you all the time
And I need you to stop the accusations
My lovin' is real life, no animation
Determined to love you long, I need patience
Girl how many times, say how many times

[Chorus]
I have to say it's only you
Yeah baby, it's only you
Yeah baby, it's only you
Yeah baby, it's only you, oh
Nobody'll catch my eye
Girl it's only you and I
Believe me, babe
No gyal ah guh get my love
No gyal ah guh get no trust
Believe me, babe

[Verse 2]
Why lie about the way I feel about my baby?
My little baby
Uh, the kissin' ain't nothin' without the passion
All I see talkin' and I need action
No get me no half cause I don't need no fraction
Just want to wake up in the mornin' with you beside me
With all of our problems behind me
It was like yesterday you were my baby
And now you could dance with anybody
Because you think I'm with anybody
Me body can't do it just for anybody
Me body can't lose just anybody
I only want

[Chorus]
Only you
Yeah baby, it's only you
Yeah baby, it's only you
Yeah baby, it's only you, oh
Nobody'll catch my eye
Girl it's only you and I
Believe me babe
No gyal ah guh get my love
No gyal ah guh get no trust
Oh, trust me
