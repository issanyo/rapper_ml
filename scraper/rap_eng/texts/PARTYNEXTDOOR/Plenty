[Verse]
So much ice on me I slip every time I see this shit
Cameras on you, how you broke but say you gangsta bitch?
Richie Rich ain't the only young nigga gettin' it
Piaget Polo wrist watch, she just wanted Wingstop
Go 'head call her, tell my bitch I'm with another ho
Ridin' with those bitches, lonely niggas sell their soul
I see jealousy, this ain't what you want
This ain't what you wanted, my niggas 'ready on it
I got hoes in croix stayed up, bring my hoes to Barbados
Hoppin' out the jet, it's so necessary
She speak Spani', don't know when she talk to me
Can I have it? Just keep on pushing up on me

[Hook]
Oh, she don't know what she's gettin' herself into
I got plenty, plenty, plenty, plenty, plenty
She don't know what she got herself into
I got hoes, she know, I got many, many
Oh, she don't know what she's gettin' herself into
I got plenty, plenty, plenty, plenty, plenty
She don't know what she got herself into
I got hoes, she know, I got many, many
