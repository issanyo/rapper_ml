[Intro]
Brown skin (brown skin) honey (honey, oh)
Oh, so sweet
You do things that's only for the camera (camera, camera)
Oh, oh, girl I'm in hell, now, now
Just keep that on the east side for me girl
Flights in the mornin' (flights in the mornin') and I'm comin'
Flights in the mornin'

[Chorus]
All cause I need your love
All cause I need your love
All cause I need your love
All cause I need...
All cause I need your love
Your love, your love, oh
Whenever you're lonely, tell them who
Tell them who go crazy for your love
(Tell them who go crazy for your love baby)
(For your love, for your love)
I, I, I love on ya

[Verse]
Yeah, I'm amazed
Pickin' up the pace
Follow my lead
Damn girl you're a criminal
You're stealin' my little peace of mind
I got club bangin' phobia
Know that sounds a little outrageous
This does nothin' to tell you
Like what just works best like I remember 'em all
It, it, it came and you left with it all
I only came cause...

[Chorus]
All cause I need your love
All cause I need your love
All cause I need your love
All cause I need...
All cause I need your love
Baby all cause of me, your love
Remember....
Whenever you're lonely, tell them who
Tell them who go crazy for you love
(Tell them who go crazy for your love baby)
(For your love, for your love)
Love baby, a lady

Oh, oh, girl I'm in hell, now, now
Brown skin (brown skin) honey (honey, oh)
Oh, so sweet
You do things that's only for the camera (camera, camera)
