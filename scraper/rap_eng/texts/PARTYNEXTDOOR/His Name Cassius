[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
His name Cass, my name PARTY, I'm just nasty
Answer to that, I'm your man, off the dome and shit
Making Glass, she too cool, bout that border
I'm luxurious, I'm a tourists, I get siri
I get dunk, off the pure, tell the white sauce

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
If I see the day, Imma go
If I pop a bean, Imma grow
Only fuck with me, back off, woah
Exactly what it seems, when the pants drop shorty
Imma put it where the sun don't shine
Yeah, Imma put it where the sun don't shine
Juicy, yeah, hot boy, yelling timber, I'm a land mine
If she chirping imma treat her like a bird
Wanna know if pussy tight just like a virgin
Cup was full of white until I poured it up with burgundy
Cup was full of white until I poured it up with burgundy
Bust that pussy open you can get it
Bust that pussy open you can get it, cyattie got my tongue
Bust that open you can get it, fuckin rich niggas was next up on your trap list huh?

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
His name PARTY, my name PeeWee
I know Cass, busting a brick out the plastic
Look at my wrist, gymnastics, I Tune with the bells and the Bopper
Tropicana white Dolce Cabanas, got a stick and extendo with hunters
Got a bitch on the blue and the bean, I'm gonna rock her like I'm Billy Jean
Got the dope that gonna make her come fiend, left the hotel with incident fees
Leave the valet, just poured up a four, It's a party next door with your hoe
Cassius Clay bounce off the ropes, leave these bitches like Longway the GOAT
She finna work, she wanna perc, she talking church
Oh now you a church girl? Tryna go back to Molly world
Bout to pull out a finger nail, she got head, call her bobby world
