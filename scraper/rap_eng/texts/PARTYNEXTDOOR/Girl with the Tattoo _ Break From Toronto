[Verse 1: Miguel]
Those innocent eyes
That smile on your face makes it easy to trust you
If they only knew
The girl with the tattoo
Like I do...

Doing what you're doing
Just to get you where you going
Yeah, I see it, baby
Just don't lose yourself along the way, no

Cause you're doing what you're doing
Just to get you where you're going
And I see it, baby
And too many others gon' ask you to say "I do"
But I knew...
The girl with the tattoo

Oh yeah, I knew
The girl with the tattoo
I used to know...

[Bridge: Miguel]
That smile on your face
Makes it easy to trust you
Those in
Those in
Those in

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
This what 'Sauga feel like in the night time
Watch what she doing when the light shine
Drunk niggas tryna talk in the strip club
Shawty silhouette look like a dollar sign
Caught up (caught up)
That's just how a nigga brought up (brought up)
Blow ones for you loonie ass niggas (Ass niggas)
Straight bills for you toonie ass niggas (Ass niggas)
My niggas bigger than the bouncer
Roll up in the bitch, still smelling like an ounce (Like an ounce)
Right quick, right quick
Tight jeans on so she feel my shit, aye (Feel my)
Tell me something good, baby
Tell me something, tell me something good, shawty
Come bring it to the hood, baby
Bring it, bring it back to the hood, shawty (Ooh!)

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
This what Sauga feels like in the night time
Bust it open, shawty, when the light shine
Still fucking with the same ass niggas
I know you want a break
I know you want a break from Toronto
Oh, girl
Westside, oh no, girl
