[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Why won't you let me love you?
Why won't you let me love you?
You know that's all I wanna do
You know that's all I wanna do
Ride for you, I'll die for you
Why won't you let me love you?
You know that's all I wanna do
(You know that's all I wanna do)

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Trust me, yeah, trust me
I know you wanna trust me, girl
Love me, yeah, love me
I know you wanna love me, girl
You love the way I pull the Porsche out
On Pembroke Pines
Wind the window down
Know I dig you, wanna make you mine
Take you to Moshi Moshi
Tryna wine and dine
Tryna get your tan on
Tryna be tearin' me fine, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I know, time is tickin', tickin', want my mind blown
I cannot forget it, girl, you're my only
I need you to get it
I want you to be more than my homie


[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Why won't you let me love you?
Why won't you let me love you?
You know that's all I wanna do
You know that's all I wanna do
Ride for you, I'll die for you
Why won't you let me love you?
You know that's all I wanna do


[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Can I pull up later, baby?
You got me on standby
I'm a player, baby you fuckin' my mind up
In my best designer
Shawty wastin' time, but it's time to make your mind up
I know you like the way the 458 skates
See the diamonds in the dash
You ain't worried 'bout the cash
But you know I got the game that be feelin' like a cheat
Got the stars in the roof, double R's in the seat
I'ma dawg, I'ma freak
Come fuck with me I'll beat that pussy W-E-T
Tell your friends that I'm your homie, I'm not tryna be
Not tryna wing it
I just don't know how to bring it
Let my nigga PARTY sing it because...

[Pre-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I know, time is tickin', tickin', want my mind blown
I cannot forget it, girl, you're my only
I need you to get it
I want you to be more than my homie


[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Why won't you let me love you?
Why won't you let me love you?
You know that's all I wanna do
You know that's all I wanna do
Ride for you, I'll die for you
Why won't you let me love you?
You know that's all I wanna do
