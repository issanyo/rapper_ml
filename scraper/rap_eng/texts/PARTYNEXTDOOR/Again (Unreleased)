[Bridge]
They won't know
Unless you tell him what it feel like
Unless you tell him that it feel right
I believe in G-O-D
You believe in hope

[Hook]
Hope my daughter looks like you
Tryna do it right
And put a ring on you
I don't wanna go out with no lie
By saying things I'd never do
And saying things I ain't ready to
Saying things I ain't ready to...do
Saying things I ain't ready to do
Saying things I ain't ready to do

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I tell you time and time again
I ain't playing with you shawty
I tell you time and time again
This ain't a game with me girl
I tell you time and time again
I ain't always perfect
I tell you time and time again
It's gonna be worth it
Is it true? Still fucking?
Still going crazy
I still love you
Still gon' call you baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
They don't know we drive each other crazy
They don't know it's days we act
They don't know 'bout this and that

Ain't never seen me on nigga
Was you like this before?

[Bridge]
They won't know
Unless you tell him what it feel like
Unless you tell him that it feel right
I believe in G-O-D
You believe in hope

[Hook]
Hope my daughter looks like you
Tryna do it right
And put a ring on you
I don't wanna go out with no lie
By saying things I'd never do
And saying things I ain't ready to
Saying things I ain't ready to...do
Saying things I ain't ready to do
Saying things I ain't ready to do
