Part I: Problems

[Verse 1]
Two beautiful women arguing over me
Oh, I hope my son has these problems
Why do these things happen so often?
Yeah, I wonder
Is this how it's gonna be
Two beautiful women claiming that they love me
Girl, tell me, is it cause I showed you how to be the best you?
Bless you, thank you women
Thank you mama
I got two beautiful women arguing over me
Is this how it's gonna be?
Problems, I hope my son has these problems

Part II: Selfless

[Verse 2]
Can I ask you crazy girls a question?
Why so selfish when niggas only good to you
Cause if I don’t love you why don’t you want no one lovin' me baby
Don’t you want to see me happy babe?
Why are you telling lies on my name?

[Hook]
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, babe, why be so selfish
What did I do to you
Selfish, selfless
I stay quiet for ya
You'd kill a bitch for me and blame it on love
You would kill yourself, O.D. and blame it on love
You would do it on yourself, they can blame it on us
And I stay quiet for ya
Selfless
You got me out here looking crazy
Selfless
They think I'm selfish but I'm selfless
