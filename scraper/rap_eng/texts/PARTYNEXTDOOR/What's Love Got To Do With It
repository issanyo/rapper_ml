Her mom found out I ain't got a job
All I do is write songs
Heard I only sing about love
She said I'm 18, what the hell I know about love?
All I know is that I break hearts
Leave 'em, love 'em, leave me, love me
Repeat over and over again

And her mom said, do I love her daughter?
And I said, do I love your daughter?
Your daughter
Then I pause for a minute and I asked her a question

What's love got to do with it?
Oh, what's love got to do with it?
What's love got to do with it?
What's love got to do with it?
What's love, what's love
What's love, what's love
What's love, what's love
What's love, what's love

Her mom found out I ain't got a job
All I do is write songs
Heard I only sing about love
She said I'm 18, what the hell I know about love?
All I know is that I break hearts
Leave 'em, love 'em, leave me, love me
Repeat over and over again

And her mom said, do I love her daughter?
And I said, do I love your daughter?
Your daughter
Then I pause for a minute and I asked her a question

What's love got to do with it?
Oh, what's love got to do with it?
What's love got to do with it?
What's love got to do with it?
What's love, what's love
What's love, what's love
What's love, what's love
What's love, what's love
