[Intro]
Baby when I'm right under your body
Baby when I'm right under your body
Take 5
Baby when I'm right under your body

[Verse 1]
Have you ever seen a mountain?
Shorty I'ma show you one
Have you ever seen a bird fly?
Flying through the sun
Have you ever seen rain drops, fall from the sky?
Have you ever seen love grow, grow through your eyes?

[Pre-Hook]
Tonight we'll go
Right onto the mountain top girl
And I will show
You everything girl just don't stop
Cause I likey likey like it
I likey likey like it
When I eat you up in my bed
When I eat you up in my bed

[Hook]
Baby when I'm right under your body
I feel like I'm on top of the world
I don't wanna be disturbed by anybody
When I'm making love with my girl
When I'm making love with my girl
When I'm making love on top of the world
The world
The world
When I'm making love on top of the world
The world
The world

[Bridge]
Hit you with this thing bet you fall in love
Baby girl I hit it the easies on
Tell me exactly just what you like
I'ma do the opposite to turn you on
I know that your favorite color is purple
Yeah yeah
But guess what I'ma do, if you let me boo?
I'ma turn that flower black and blue

[Hook]
