[Verse:]
Driving down a broken road
Drowned in the tears of a hurting man
Never knew how far I'd go
But I know this wasn't part of the plan

[Bridge:]
Happiness is like a fairytale, my  mama told me. When I was young
But a little faith will never fail. It'll get you back on your own
I'm just a man with million dollar dreams, and not a dollar in my hand
And I'm just a man that has a smile on his face, but his mind's a mystery
(I got a question)

[Hook:]
Is there an angle, watching over me?
'Cause all that I've done, is nothing but run
Am I a goner?
Am I a goner?
Am I a goner?
Am I a goner?

[Verse:]
Driving down a broken road
Drowned in the tears of a hurting man
Never knew how far I'd go
But I know this wasn't part of the plan

[Bridge:]
Happiness is like a fairytale, my  mama told me. When I was young
But a little faith will never fail. It'll get you back on your own
I'm just a man with million dollar dreams, and not a dollar in my hand
And I'm just a man that has a smile on his face, but his mind's a mystery
(I got a question)

[Hook:]
Is there an angle, watching over me?
'Cause all that I've done, is nothing but run
Am I a goner?
Am I a goner?
Am I a goner?
Am I a goner?

*beat plays*

[Hook:]
Is there an angle, watching over me?
'Cause all that I've done, is nothing but run
Am I a goner?
Am I a goner?
Am I a goner?
Am I a goner?

[Outro:]
Driving down a broken road
Drowned in the tears of a hurting man
