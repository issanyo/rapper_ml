[Verse 1]
It’s been about six months long now, and we ain’t doing ish but getting closer
I wish all this could last forever, and I ain't joking what so ever
I wake up every morning to your picture, it makes me smile to know that I am with ya
I send messages to your phone, telling you I can’t wait until I get home

[Bridge]
One night, while I’m on the road
Your voice can paint pictures to the blind, and smoke can bring sun to the sunrise
I see your face (I see your face), every time I fall asleep (every time I fall asleep)
Cause the angels call my name (angels call my name), telling me that you’re at peace
Oh no

[Hook] x 2
And I can’t wait (I can’t wait), to see your face (to see your face)
To see your smile (to see your smile), I ain't seen in a while (ain’t seen in a while)

So baby I cannot wait

[Verse 2]
I know your momma thinks I’m way to occupied, to have a girl up in my busy life
But I promise I’mma stick it through, no matter no matter what I got to do
And girl, trust that I got time, enough time to keep a smile on your face
Your my exhale, your my escape
And baby I just can’t wait

[Bridge]

[Hook] x 2

[Verse 3]
Babe, I wanna hold your hand, girl I just want one touch
And lady, damn I miss your kiss, everything you did, damn I miss your hugs
Girl, and you know you stay from drama, no if’s, and’s, but’s or comma’s
I’m young but I know what’s real, is this how your supposed to feel?

[Hook] x 3
