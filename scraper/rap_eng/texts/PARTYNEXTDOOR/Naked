[Intro]
Fiesta, fiesta
I'm just tryna see you naked shawty
Let it go

[Chorus]
I don't know why you do the things you do
Askin' me questions like :
"What I need?" and "What I like?"
I'ma keep it real with you
I need you to get na-naked
I need you to get na-naked
I need you to get get naked
I need you to get get naked

[Verse 1]
Don't say that you want it if you can't take it
I'ma throw these hunnids can you break it
Down, down, down, down, down, down for me
Would scrap for me, would you stay 'round for me
Is you a bad bitch or no way
I just need to know before the doorway
Spendin' all this money was a foreplay
Money say but suicide doors say
All my niggas dogs, they on all fours
All my niggas ridin' in them foreigns
You can't cop this jewelry ain't no doubt
I don't need a few, I need all out
And if you leave it up to me
I probably wouldn't leave right now
Sippin' bottles of the Geese right now
Girl you're fuckin' with a G right now
The games that you play, girl I don't play
Tick tick and boom [?]
Wrist rollie looking like Golden State
Tick tick boom waitin' on you

[Chorus]
I don't know why you do the things you do
Askin' me questions like :
"What I need?" and "What I like?"
I'ma keep it real with you
I need you to get na-naked
I need you to get na-naked
I need you to get get naked
I need you to get get naked

[Verse 2]
There's too much clothes on you girl
There's too many hoes on you girl
I need you to get na-naked
I need you to get na-naked
Back it up baby I need the facin'
No Keanu Reeves I don't need no replacements
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
And keep your panties like your pants and let it go
Eenie meenie miney moe
Catch a lion by his toes
If money high I let it go
If money high I'ma let it go
Girl drop it up to me like dominoes
I don't know what to do with them honeys over here
Don't know what to throw 'em with the hunnids over here
What I don't know...
I don't know what you're doin'

[Chorus]
I don't know why you do the things you do
Askin' me questions like :
"What I need?" and "What I like?"
I'ma keep it real with you
I need you to get na-naked
I need you to get na-naked
I need you to get get naked
I need you to get get naked

I don't know why you do the things you do
Askin' me questions like :
"What I need?" and "What I like?"
I'ma keep it real with you
I need you to get na-naked
I need you to get na-naked
I need you to get get naked
I need you to get get naked
