[Verse 1]
I miss waking up beside you just to see the sun rise
We used to talk about the different thing we'd name our child
I could spend a day plus forever staring at your eyes
But I hurts to know that you're gone out my life

[Chorus]
Heartbroken suffering sorrow
But I love ya so I can't let go
Tell me is there something that I did wrong
Since you left there's no place that I call home
Since you been gone, loneliness won't leave me alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone
Alone, alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone

[Verse 2]
It seems like every breath I take another piece of me is gone
How could something that was once so right go so wrong
Momma loved you just as much but I had to move on and be strong
And that means to be loved by someone for so long

[Chorus]
Heartbroken suffering sorrow
But I love ya so I can't let go
Tell me is there something that I did wrong
Since you left there's no place that I call home
Since you been gone, loneliness won't leave me alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone
Alone, alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone
Tell me is there something that I did wrong
Since you left there's no place that I call home
Since you been gone, loneliness won't leave me alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone
Alone, alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone

[Verse 3]
Thoughts of heaven's angels when I hear your name
You were once my joy but now my pain
And the hardest part about this loss
Empty frames where you picture was
There's no other with your love
So I stuck back at square one

[Chorus]
Tell me is there something that I did wrong
Since you left there's no place that I call home
Since you been gone, loneliness won't leave me alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone
Alone, alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone
Tell me is there something that I did wrong
Since you left there's no place that I call home
Since you been gone, loneliness won't leave me alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone
Alone, alone
Loneliness won't leave me alone
