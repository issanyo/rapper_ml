[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'ma keep going, keep going
Keep going, going
I'ma keep going, keep going
Keep going, going
I'ma keep going, keep going
Keep going, going
I'ma keep going, keep going
Keep going, going
Even if your phone starts ringin'
Even if your boyfriend trippin'
I'ma keep going, going in
Even if your boyfriend ringin'

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Karma's a bitch, yeah I know
Yeah I know
I fucked her too, baby I fucked her slow
I done break the bag so baby I can break the boards
Some things these niggas don't gotta know
You say "Yes," I say "Woah"
Best friend was there too
She said she'd keep her mouth closed
Not worried 'bout it anymo'
Woah, woah
I'm already knocking it down like a four-by-four
I'm the one you wanna creep with
I'm the one you wanna sleep with
Cause I'm the one that make you feel it
I'm the one that's gonna keep it up
There's someone out there with sympathy for your nigga
Not me
Don't trust your girl around me

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'ma keep going, keep going
Keep going, going
I'ma keep going, keep going
Keep going, going
I'ma keep going, keep going
Keep going, going
I'ma keep going, keep going
Keep going, going
Even if your phone starts ringin'
Even if your boyfriend trippin'
I'ma keep going, going in
Even if your boyfriend ringin'

[Post-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Woah, woah ooh, oh oh oh oh
You gon' put the silence on your phone
Cause you know
Woah, woah ooh, oh oh oh oh
You gon' put the silence on your phone
Cause you know
Yeah the boyfriend's trippin'
Your boyfriend's trippin'
Your boyfriend's trippin'
Wait... I think your boyfriend ringin'

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Niggas say shit, yeah I know, yeah I know
She fuck with two things she tryna get on
Get it how you live I ain't hatin'
Had to put it back on rotation
Shoot my shot, I'ma shoot my... shot
"How you get you so fly Dolla" bitch I'm self-taught
Why you always high
Why you always this
Why you always that
When we gettin' you and Party on the track
I'm the one she wanna be with
I'm the one she wanna sleep with
I'm the only one that make you feel it
I'm the only one that keep my word, word, word, word, word, word, word
He gon' lie to you, not me
You said bring the weekend and have a three

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'ma keep going, keep going
Keep going, going
I'ma keep going, keep going
Keep going, going
I'ma keep going, keep going
Keep going, going
I'ma keep going, keep going
Keep going, going
Even if your phone starts ringin'
Even if your boyfriend trippin'
I'ma keep going, going in
Even if your boyfriend ringin'

[Post-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Ty Dolla $ign]
Woah, woah ooh, oh oh oh oh
You gon' put the silence on your phone
Cause you know
Woah, woah ooh, oh oh oh oh
You gon' put the silence on your phone
Cause you know
Yeah the boyfriend's tripping
The boyfriend tripping
Your boyfriend's tripping
The boyfriend tripping
Your boyfriend's tripping
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
I think your boyfriend ringing

[Verse 3: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Stop me when I'm lying
I've been on your mind for a minute
I don't wanna call you out
I told you I'ma get it
Now look how I'm gonna beat it
Cause you trust me like I trust you
And you comfortable like you rocking a one piece suit
We never talk about who gon' keep who
We always keep it cool
This how you like it, like it, like it
I'm not a psychic, psychic, psychic
I told you real bitches moving in silence
But it's so hard when I'm all up in your stomach
Better call the sirens, ambulance
It's gettin' so violent
Girl there's someone out there
Who got sympathy for your nigga
Not me I got none so ever
