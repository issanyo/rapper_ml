[Verse]
If I knew I was wastin' my time
Would end up wastin' my time
With all these shoulda coulda wouldas
I'm in her ear one time
Tryna tell her how I rhyme
She heard it all
I know she heard it all
Girl I can change your life
But you heard it all
But you heard it all
I'm from the city
Where you ain't gotta love too long
You ain't gotta love to fuck
Girl, I'm just tryna say
I'm from the city
So don't believe what they say
Just believe what they do to ya
You can't tell these bitches nothing
She belongs to the city
They gone, they gone, they gone
They was lookin' for nothing (somethin')
She belongs to the city
(Yeah you know)
