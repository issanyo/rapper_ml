[Chorus]
Sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station
Sex with me, so amazing
Sex with me, so amazing

[Verse 1]
Vodka and water, and a lemon
And a few other things I can not mention
Oh-na-na-na-na

[Drop: John Blake]

[Chorus]
And sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me

[Verse 2]
You know I got the sauce (sauce), you know I’m saucy
And it’s always wet, a [bitch] never ever had to use lip gloss on it
I’mma need you deeper than six, it's not a coffin
We’re not making love, tryna get nasty
Wrap up your [drugs], come make me happy
Sex with me is amazing, with her it’ll feel alright
The sex doesn’t get any better, make it long, let it be all night
I know, I make it hard to let go
Tonight, all night, I’m Monroe
Even if I’m alone

[Chorus]
Sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Oh-na-na-na-na, oh-na-na-na-na

[Drop: John Blake]

[Chorus]
And sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me
