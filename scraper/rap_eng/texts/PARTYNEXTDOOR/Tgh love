[hook]
Why my love broken so many time's, why did you have to do me so wrong
We could of just been friend's but we knew we couldn't get along
It's just you and me
I hurt so many people who mental hurt my frame, my time for the risen has come up, my heart beating so slow
Why love got to be unbreakable, my heart in a deep shadow despair with the love one's near
I see a light between the inner of the earth o father help me not sin again


[ verse 1]

Remember when we first met, are love was unbreakable to sweat
It's just you and me baby the light's turn down with the volume blasting off the radio set
Please don't cry i know i'm here for you, i know times get ruff but your getting closer to a brighter future
It's just me and you on the couch let's have a shot of liquid water to ease are pain
Baby i wan't you bad you just don't understand what you do to me let's make sweet passionate love by the balcony
Don't cry i'm here for you by any mean's, i don't want to make you hurt no more
I know we been threw a-lot, i'm just saying pucker up your lip's and give daddy a shot  cause you know i'm be there for you
I know i ain't like other men who you really don't know i'm just trying to walk up to you and speak to you
