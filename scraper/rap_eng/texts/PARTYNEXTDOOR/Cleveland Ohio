[Verse]
Light-skinned, 5'5", brown eyes, thick thighs
Shawty know how to put down
She the one that I check, and the girl that I hit
Every time that I hit the O-Town
I sit back, smoke a tree, [?], shawty lapsed
Steady dealing with my grenade
While I'm stuck in the lab, and shawty made it clap
And she know I'm only here to get paid

[Hook]
I'mma get it, Ohio-hio-hio-hio-hio-hio-hio
