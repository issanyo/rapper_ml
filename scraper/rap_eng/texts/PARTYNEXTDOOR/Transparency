[Pre-Chorus]
Don't fake it
Only keep the loud on me
In the morning asking "Don't fake it with me"
You love me when the, the drugs are loud
The drugs are loud
The drugs are loud
The drugs are loud
The drugs are loud
The drugs are loud
The drugs are loud

[Verse 1]
When there's six grams in the blunt
And thirty ounces of vodka, let's head dive in the truth
I'm fucking somebody's daughter
Spend my tithes on BAPE
But somehow still getting richer
Spend 10 bands girl, for you and your twin sister
The truth will set you free
Now I need you to open up for me
The moon will set you free
500 shed some light on me
Nodding off, bobblehead
The whole squad looking out for me
Last time on the meds
First time on the balcony

[Chorus]
Don't judge me, I got demons and you know, you know
Cause you and I are transparency
All I want is your transparency
Come tell me what I already know
I taught you what you already know
If you still want me, take me babe

[Verse 2]
Right now it's
3am in Toronto, I know you want me still
4am, let's be honest, I know you want me still
I know you want me still, I know you want me still
4am in Toronto, I know you want me still
I know you see that Porsche
I know you see the condo
I know you see that Aston
None of that shit I work hard for
3am in Toronto, and I know you want me still
3am in Toronto, and I know you want me still

[Bridge]
Yeah, I think you want me still
Connected flights to Toronto
And I know you want me still
Pullin' up with that bubbly
Pullin' up on your floor
You just happy I made it
'Cause Champagnepapi yo dog
4am in that mansion
10pm in that car
5am in that Maybach
Forgies on me, rose gold
4am in Atlanta and I know you want me still
[?] and I know you want me still

[Chorus]
Girl, don't judge me I got demons and you know, you know
Cause you know your transparency
All I want is your transparency
Come tell me what I already know
I taught you what you already know

[Outro]
Don't fake it
Only keep the loud on me
And I'm only asking, don't fake it with me
You love me when the, the drugs are loud
The drugs are loud
The drugs are loud
The drugs are loud
The drugs are loud
The drugs are loud
The drugs are loud
You love me when the
(You love me when the)
(You love me when the)
