[Intro]
I did some things so she could love me, yeah

[Verse 1]
Don't choose a club over this tonight
Don't choose your friends over this tonight
Don't you forget the way I make it feel
Don't say you won't when I know you will
Don't you know that I told myself to fall back from you
I turn around and come back for you
Sometimes I want it all back
Sometimes I want it all back, yeah
You said that you need someone who's constant
Before you go cut your other options
You know that I got commitment issues
But I'm way too honest when I'm with you

[Chorus: Sample]
I love you and I want to be loved
But I just don't know how to tell you, oh no no
I did some things so she could love me, yeah
I love you and I want to be loved
But I just don't know how to tell you, oh no no

[Verse 2]
Don't choose your bed over mine tonight
Don't you pretend that you'll be alright
I wonder if you’re really telling the truth
‘Bout who’s around, when I’m not around
When you're in your feelings or I'm out of town
I wanna know who you got that's loving you
I wanna know if somebody made you choose
What you've been through
You say that I always change the topic
When you ask about my other options
But you know that I got commitment issues
But I'm way too honest when I'm with you

[Chorus: Sample]
I love you and I want to be loved
But I just don't know how to tell you, oh no no
I did some things so she could love me, yeah
I love you and I want to be loved
But I just don't know how to tell you, oh no no

[Outro]
Right on, baby
For the first time in my life
I feel the very same way
And I want you to know, baby
What it really feels like to be close to someone
You know, once in everybody's life
The true meaning of love is experienced
You learn how to love and most of all
How good it feels to be loved by someone that really loves you
