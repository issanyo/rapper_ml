[Verse 1: Revdog]
Had to drop a lil something for the big fans
Run and go tell your friends I’m the shit, man
So out of this world like Pikmin
Revdog so hot haters get tan
You know the flow cold like a penguin
Candyman had to switch it up so I’m singin'
Yo shit’s dried up like a raisin
Revdog pouring up just say when

Shout out OVO and Party
Shining like I won Lombardi
I’m up on the net iCarly
You salty, like sardines
Flow cold like I’m from Toronto
I beat the beat up like Bongos
Revdog want the glory pronto
I’m on cloud nine like Rondo

Yeah, praise what they giving me
Revdog steady repping Italy
Haters actin foul like a penalty
They bugging out like a centipede
Revel’s level up top
Candyman going crazy like a nutjob
I’m eating shit up like a buzzsaw
Candyman popping up like huzzah

I’m going up, heat rises
You know I don’t like surprises
So gold, my flow be the wisest
So cold, my flow be the nicest
I’m way too fly airplane mode
You know that shit’s true if I say so
Destination, too many pesos
Candyman going out when the bass goes
