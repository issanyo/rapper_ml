[Verse 1]
Five fingers on it (five fingers)
Hit it like you own it, I’mma hit it like I’m on it
Straight shots of the blue dot
(Shots, shots, shots, shots)
Baby, I’mma pick your poison
Oh-we, ah-yeah, you gon’ need it
I’m off that la-la
I’mma get it wet like jacuzzi

[Chorus 2]
And sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me

[Breakdown]
You know I got the....sex, sex
I make it go
Sex, sex, sex
I make it go, oh, oh...
I make it go, oh, oh...
Sex sex sex

[Verse 2]
You know I got the sauce (sauce), you know I’m saucy
And it’s always wet, a [bitch] never ever had to use lip gloss on it
I’mma need you deeper than six, it's not a coffin
We’re not making love, tryna get nasty
Wrap up your drugs, come make me happy
Sex with me is amazing, with her it’ll feel alright
The sex doesn’t get any better, make it long, let it be all night
I know, I know, I make it hard to let go
Tonight, all night, I’m Monroe
Even if I’m alone

[Chorus]
Sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station

[Breakdown]
I make it go, oh, oh...
I make it go, oh, oh...
You know I got the....sex, sex
I make it go
Sex, sex, sex
I make it go
I make it go
Sex, sex sex
You know I got the...
You know I got the...
You know I got the...
I make it go
You know I got the...
I make it go

[Outro]
Sex with me, sex with me (oh yeah)
Sex with me, sex with me
I make it go, I make it..go, oh
I make it go, I make it..go, oh
