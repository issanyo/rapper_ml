[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
You're the only one that makes me wait all the time
Oh, yeah, you blow my mind
Boom, boom, you blow my mind
You're the only one that gets under my skin
You're doin' damage
That nobody's ever did, oh

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Do I gotta chase you every summer?
Do I have to replace you every summer?
You're the only woman on my mind (mind)
You're the only way I spend my time
Tick, tick, tick, boom
Can't get you out of the room of my head
This shit takes two
Is it too soon to get you into my bed?
I want you now
I need you off the ground
I want you screamin' out loud
I want your body right now
I can't help it right now

[Chorus: Halsey]
You're the only one that makes me wait all the time
Oh, yeah, you blow my mind
Boom, boom, you blow my mind
You're the only one that gets under my skin
You're doin' damage
Nobody's ever did, oh

[Verse 2: Halsey]
Do I gotta face you with another?
I'll never replace you with another
You're the only man that's in my mind
You know that nobody hit it right
Tick, tick, tick, boom
This ain't a honeymoon, we all night instead
Sleep until noon
I still assume that you'll be in my bed
I want it here, don't make me wait all year
Already facin' my fears
Come closer to my ears
I gotta hear 'em all clear

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Halsey]
You're the only one that makes me wait all the time
Oh, yeah, you blow my mind
Boom, boom, you blow my mind
You're the only one that gets under my skin
You're doin' damage
That nobody's ever did, oh
You're the only one that makes me wait all the time
Oh, yeah, you blow my mind
Boom, boom, you blow my mind
Ooh, yeah

[Bridge: Halsey & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
You're the only one that makes me feel some type of way
You're the only one that makes me feel, night and day
Night and day (ooh yeah)
You're the only one that makes me feel some type of way
You're the only one that makes me feel, night and day
Night and day (ooh yeah)
You're the only one that makes me feel some type of way
You're the only one that makes me feel, night and day
Night and day (ooh yeah)
You're the only one that makes me feel some type of way
Type of way

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Halsey]
You're the only one that makes me wait all the time
Oh, yeah, you blow my mind
Boom, boom, you blow my mind
You're the only one that gets under my skin
You're doin' damage
That nobody's ever did, oh, oh
