[Verse 1]
Stop looking for a reason to hate me, just hate me
Nobody's perfect you know, I'm working on me
They jealous so they lurking on me, I don't mind
My new girl's not too thirsty to ride, she riding for me
Ride or dying for me
Girl, you're the reason, you're lonely tonight
But this is the season to get back your life

[Hook]
This is your chance (I know you know the truth)
Come take a chance (It's not that I blame you, I know you know the truth)
When you see (I know you know the truth)
It's not that I blame you, it's not you that I blame you
I blame you

[Verse 2]
Five foot five of pure sexy, I see you
Every bitch wanna be you
Every nigga wanna meet you
You're getting bookings in my city
I see niggas looking in my city
And I know what you been up to
But that is no good, it's no good Even though I do it
Baby, I'm outchea, baby, I'm outchea, you know what I'm pursuing Yeah you can know, girl, you're the reason, you're lonely tonight
But this is the season to get back your life

[Hook]
This is your chance (I know you know the truth)
Come take a chance (It's not that I blame you, I know you know the truth)
When you see (I know you know the truth)
It's not that I blame you, it's not you that I blame you
I blame you

[Outro]
And what do your say to a girl that's heard it all before?

And what do you say to a girl that’s heard it all before?
Say
Time is wasting, time is wasting
Time is wasting, babe, time is wasting
“Bitch, hurry up. This nigga finna' to move on! Get in the fucking car with that nigga!"
Time is wasting, time is wasting, time is wasting
