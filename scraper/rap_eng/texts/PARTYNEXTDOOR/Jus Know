[Intro: Mister Lies]
Back when we were young...
Back when we were young, I...
Back when we were young...
Back when we were young...

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I remember everything, know that I'm watching
I remember everything, just know
I see you then look away, just know
'Cause I remember what you took away, just know (ah, ah)
Not everybody is your friend, baby, no, no, no, no, no, no
Not every nigga is my nigga, baby, yeah, no, no, no, no, no
Hey, you used to kiss me then smile (I remember every, oh)
Shit that I missed for a while (oh, oh)
I remember everything (ooh)
I remember everything
I remember everything (I remember every...)
Oh, oh, oh, ooh
I remember everything
I remember everything, yeah (I remember every...)
Oh, oh (I remember everything)

[Verse: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I remember everything, know that I'm watching
I remember everything, just know
I see you then look away, just know
'Cause I remember what you took away, just know (just know)
Mama still checks the letters
That I used to write you when we broke up
When I said shit like...
"When we grow up, I'ma buy you shit when we blow up"
Hey, we were the original Kanye and Kim
You know, Kanye and Kim
Now it's Drizzy and Rih, it was so obvious then, oh, yeah
You know I remember, I remember everything (I remember)
Even details about the wedding ring (I remember)
I got questions about everything (I remember)
Broke your heart, girl, you deserve these things (I remember)
Are you still mad that I made you pay for everything, everything?
Girl, I got it now, girl, I got it now
Girl, I got you now

[Bridge: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I remember everything
I remember everything
I remember everything (I remember every...)
Oh, oh, oh, ooh
I remember everything
I remember everything, yeah (I remember every...)
Oh, oh (I remember everything)
I remember everything
I remember everything, yeah (I remember every...)
Oh, oh (I remember everything)

[Outro 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I remember everything, know that I'm watching
I remember everything, just know (ah)
I see you then look away, just know
'Cause I remember what you took away

[Outro 2: Travis Scott & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm never gon' call you, I'm always gon' ball you, I ball you (ah)
That's for real, it's the same shit, it's amazing
You know that I been rollin' deep
713, that's my Zip, I reside
I didn't know what you did all day, you remember
Girl, you know, girl, you do (ah)
I know you remember...
All day...
