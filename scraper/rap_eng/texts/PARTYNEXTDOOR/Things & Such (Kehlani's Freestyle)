[Intro]
Gin got me feeling real honest
Now that me and shawty platonic
Shout to G Ry and Neenyo

[Verse]
Smoke just a little bit, drank just a little bit
He don't drink like he used to
He don't think like he used to
Life taught you new things
Now you wanna do things
These hills keep track of your New Balance
Since you lost him you got a new balance
I can't say I do better, no, no, no
But I'll act like I know, know, know, better
I can't say that I do better
But I can't say I never knew better, no, no, no, no
If I ever had you, think I coulda had you
All your exes mad too, cause somehow I just bagged you
Crushing girl, I'm glad too
Fuck you 'til you cum, girl I'm glad to
Yeah you know I had to
Mmm, yeaa
Walking down your steps with no bra or panties
Mmmm...
Girl you know better, ask your auntie
She said "Who's that nigga?", he's a R&B singer
"Who's that nigga, what's his intention?"
You say "he's a good nigga, he's a good nigga, he's a hood nigga"
No, no, no, no, no
We act like we don't know, no, no, no, no
No ifs, no ands, no buts, no whatsoever
We can't say we never knew better
No, no, no, no, no
But I have to act like I don't know, like it's whatever
But I can't promise I'll do better
No but I know, better
But I cannot promise
Every nigga want a bad bitch
Every woman want the magic
Throwin' ones at mad bad bitches
Dirty money, dirty habits
Fuck the Uber, I'ma cab it
Calling me to say you want this
You lonely at home thinking mad shit
Fuck me, I know you a savage, mmmmm
Peelin' back the layers like a motherfuckin' cabbage, feenin'
Girl don't keep no secrets from me
Who did you love that I gotta shake hands with?
Who did you love that I gotta make plans with?
If we not standing then it's not a one night stand and
I'm not romantic, I'm not with the antics, no, no, no, no
Damn I wish I took things slower

[Outro]
Both knew betta
Thank God that I'm poured up
Cause she know better
Vodka and you make me crazy
Gin and you make me crazy
