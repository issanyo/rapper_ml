[Intro]
Who can hit those harmonies better than me?
Better than me yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm more than just an option
Refuse to be forgotten
I took a chance with my heart
And I feel it taking over

[Hook]
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your love
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Verse 2]
I'm more than just a number
I doubt you'll find another
So every single summer
I'll be the one that you'll remember

[Hook]
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your love
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Verse 3]
It's more than just a mission
You hear, but you don't listen
You better pay attention
And get what you've been missing

[Hook]
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your love
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Bridge]
Are you gonna find your love? Yeah
Are you gonna find your love?
Are you gonna find your love?
Love......
Love.....

[Hook]
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your love
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
