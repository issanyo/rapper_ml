[Hook]
Girl you could walk away you could give it to me (Girl)
Give you a key to the crib, just lock it for me
You be living good [?]
Niggas always lie you got to get to know me
You gotta give me your all or nothing

[Verse]
[?] I don't want it
[?] henny [?] remy, I stay saucy like spaghetti
I just pulled up in that austin power (Skkrt)
With the mojo
And my lifestyle flashy flashy like the polaroid photo
[?]
Pockets [?]
Got the kinda cars that doctors drive so police do not stop me
Iâ€™m a different kind of sexy, and my lifestyle extra private
I'm so fly so fly so extra, I touch elbows with the pilot
I went MIA in MIA, now I'm rejuvenated
My bitch Keanu Reeves, all of these niggas they just replacements
We could ball just like Tiger, watch it all come back
Your the only one I want to stunt with

[Outro]
Girl you know I want your, all or nothing
[?] feel like i gotta say it to you
I just wanna tell it to you, I just wanna love you
All or nothing
All or nothing
