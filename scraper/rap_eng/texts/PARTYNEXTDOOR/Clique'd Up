[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Moved my mama out the apartments
Poppa mad that I don't call him
Find a credit card and I charged it
Swear to god I'm already ballin'
All my exs from one ocho, wanna fuck me
Told my mama that they miss and love me
All my haters clique'd up
All my haters clique'd up
All my haters clique'd up, up
Nig - nigga, all my haters clique'd up, up
All my haters clique'd up

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Bitch, I get more pussy, pussy than a pad
I'm into female finger rollin' abs
I'm into [?] smellin' cash
I do not have a hard day to call a cab
I need an Uber, I'm in the future
I need a low drop, with a bad bitch in it
I need a Spanish bitch that need a stallion
I be speakin' spanish, buenos tienes
Then I came from London, the way I manage
I dropped the top, now the roof missin'
And the whip stopped, we was still spinnin'
It will take a lot for you to leave with it
She policing ya, I got her teaching ya
I gave her tongue to ya, gave what ya want from her
And nigga I don't rely on your word, I don't reply on your word
Man I'm the kid from the cold, you niggas story is over
Fuck it nigga, that boy is old, I need all my niggas home
Who knew that, without a diploma I'm cash
And all of my haters: I'm still countin' cash

All my haters clique'd up
All my haters clique'd up
All my haters clique'd up, up
Nig - nigga, all my haters clique'd up, up
All my haters clique'd up, bitch!

[Verse 2: King Louie]
Bitch! My name is Louie, but they call me Tony
So many mini-mes, when did I start cloning?
So many hate me and they don't even know me
She really basic, but she act like Naomi
Droppin' bottom a real nigga
I ain't into women that ain't into women
I can't deal with them, nah, no
I met your ho at the party next door
She look just look like the dime from before
If that bitch love me then I love her more
Granny always told me that I was a star
She just told me that I wouldn't get far
Now they pay me just to come to they school, hann
Pay back's a bitch and my bitches like bitches
And I record 'em me killin' the witnesses
So stick with the shits, they wasn't trippin'
Tony big pippin' [?]
[?] with the balls And stay flat, cause we cough
Get paid like a stick up when my head's quicker
I handle the coke and get lit on that swisher
[?] love my country and love some money too
