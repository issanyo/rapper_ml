[Chorus]
Don't hold your breath
Don't wait on my love
Don't hold your breath
Don't wait on my love

[Verse 1]
Don't wait on my reply to your text
Don't wait on my nut from your sex
Don't trust me to capture the moment
Forgive me, it just was a moment
Don't lay up, I'd rather her stand down
I heard number two is your man now
Don't mind me being number two now
I'ma man up, ain't no man down
You see, I don't give no fucks now
Is this something we discussed now?
The truth got you in disgust now
'Cause I'd rather we just fuck now

[Chorus]
Don't hold your breath
(Don't hold it, ohh)
Don't wait on my love
(Don't wait on my love, oh no)
Don't hold your breath
(Don't hold it, no)
Don't wait on my love
(Ooh, don't wait on my love, love)

[Verse 2]
I put the dirt into dirt-bag
Still got your jacket in my bag
I stood you up, that was my bad
Gave me your heart, watch me break that
Many different bitches in the coupe
This is how low this the mack stoop
Me being faithful's the issue
Tryna clean up 'cause you comin' soon
I broke her off in the livin' room
There is a smell in the livin' room
No, that's fucked up, that's what pimpin' do
No, that's fucked up, that's what pimpin' do

[Chorus]
Don't hold your breath
(Don't hold your breath, no, no)
Don't wait on my love
(Don't wait on it, don't wait on it, whoa)
Don't hold your breath
(You might suffocate, yeah)
Don't wait on my love
(Don't wait on my love, don't wait on my love, ohh)

[Verse 3]
Wash my dick off before I get home
Maison Margiela on me, though
I'm the opposite of hero
The opposite of your hero
The makeup, the breakup was see-through
The way I did you was illegal
Your girl was right, yeah, she called it
You should believe in your people
Tucked you, then went to the strip club
V.I.P., I got my dick sucked
Came back to you an' I kissed you
That led to fuckin' on the tour bus
Packed up an' went back to Oakland
Finally, it's out in the open
I gave you the whole beauty to hope in

[Chorus]
Don't hold your breath
(Don't hold your breath, don't hold your breath, woo)
Don't wait on my love
(Don't wait on me, I'm just gonna let you down, let you down)
Don't hold your breath
(Breath, ohh)
Don't wait on my love

[Outro]
I ain't shit, you gotta know now
I ain't shit, you gotta know now
