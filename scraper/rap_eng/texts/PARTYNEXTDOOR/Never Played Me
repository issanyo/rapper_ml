PARTYNEXTDOOR

[Chorus]
Woah, you seem to amaze me
Woah, you seem to amaze me
You never ever tried to play me
You amazed me, you amazed me
You amazed me, you amazed me
You amazed me, you amazed me
You amazed me, you amazed me
You amazed me, never played me

[Verse 1]
Let you leave the house with the credit card
And you only swipe what you need 'cause you got what you need
Never really stop at your parents' house
'Cause you know I'm ballin' like the league
And you got your own key, yeah
Let me drop you off in the P.O. hopin' they see me
S in your VVs, only snake is GG
All it's a long time since I've done seen you
In that dress, I wanna take you out that dress
I seen enough to be impressed

[Chorus]
Woah, you seem to amaze me
Woah, you seem to amaze me
You never ever tried to play me
You amazed me, you amazed me
You amazed me, you amazed me
You amazed me, you amazed me
You amazed me, you amazed me
You amazed me, never played me

[Verse 2]
What them niggas, what them niggas
You don't give a what
Drank that Henny, smoke that reggie
Still ain't give 'em none
You tell 'em, "Heaven" when they ask you where you from
Then seven seconds later, nigga, what you want?
Is you gon' ride for me, baby? Uh
Those DMs go crazy, ooh
All the coupes are from Beijing, uh
I might swerve in your lane and... uh
You amaze me
Every time I come through, you amaze me
Put it down, cook real food
Whip it up, bake game fleek
That's how a nigga done got thick
I'm grown, grown hearin' that shit
On my own, I got rich

[Chorus]
Woah, you seem to amaze me
Woah, you seem to amaze me
You never ever tried to play me
You amazed me, you amazed me
You amazed me, you amazed me
You amazed me, you amazed me
You amazed me, you amazed me
You amazed me, never played me

[Verse 3]
Sippin' on that blue Bombay
I bet you know how to walk perfect in those new J Spades
You off a perky and you sayin' that you need your space
You wanna dance, but won't give no play, no play, no play but to your bae
They say you up tight but you down
They got this whole thing twisted 'round
You don't homie bop around
You know word gon' get around
You know birds gon' get around

[Chorus]
Woah, you seem to amaze me
Woah, you seem to amaze me
You never ever tried to play me
You amazed me, you amazed me
You amazed me, you amazed me
You amazed me, you amazed me
You amazed me, you amazed me
You amazed me, never played me
