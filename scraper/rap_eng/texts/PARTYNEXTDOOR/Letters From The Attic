[Verse 1]
If everything would change to the way that it's supposed to
I wouldn't bother God, and pray for a miracle
And all the skies are blue and there's no sign of pain
This, too, shall pass but right now it's here to wake
Nothing is perfect, nothing is normal
Is everything worth it, being this formal?
Losing my patience, is there any time?
Fake till we make it, we tried it every time
And now I'm so lonely
Waiting on the winds
To call upon your name
And tell me where you've been
Oh whoa

[Hook]
It feels so lonely, in the attic
You said that I'd shine but I won't let the sun in
And now I'm so alone
Alone, alone, alone, alone, alone, alone
Alone up in the attic
All alone up in the attic, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Your life has changed, and mines nothing new
All of the fame means nothing to you
I'd trade the world and anything I own
To have you up here, sitting on your throne
There's no one I love more right now
One thing I got sure is "right now", baby

[Hook]
So lonely, in the attic
You said that I'd shine but I won't let the sun in
And now I'm so alone
Alone, alone, alone, alone, alone, alone
Oh, I'm so alone
Alone up in the attic
All alone up in the attic, yeah yeah

[Verse 3]
Guardian angel, please find my love
Tell her I need her, I'll never give up
Tell me you love me, tell me you care
Tell me you need me, tell me out there
Lead me to my heart again
Without it my love is broken
Lonely up in the attic, baby oh
I won't let you go, no, baby

[Hook]
It feels so lonely, in the attic
You said that I'd shine but I won't let the sun in
And now I'm so alone
Alone, alone, alone, alone, alone, alone
Oh, I'm so alone
Alone up in the attic
All alone up in the attic, yeah yeah
