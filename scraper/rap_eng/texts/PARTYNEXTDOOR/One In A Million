[Intro]
Love me babe, Lo-Love me babe
Love me babe, gotta love me babe, love me babe
Lo-Love me babe, Lo-Love me babe, gotta love me babe

[Verse 1]
But baby girl I'm getting low
My heart is dying, turn into stone
And I want you to know that I won't let you go
And you don't understand how it feels
It's so surreal and baby girl and you won't understand how it feels
Baby this pain is real and I need you to understand that I was your man
And baby girl you don't understand the plan baby I was ya man and baby

[Hook]
My love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on
I gave you a really good feeling all day long

[Verse 2]
I wanna see you and me
Grow together in harmony
I know it's cheesy just trust me girl
But I ain't playing, f-fuck the world
And I want you to know that I'm here for you baby and I won't let go
And I want you to see it's you and me baby if you let it be
And I don't think you understand that I was ya man
And baby girl I don't think that you know that I can't let go baby

[Hook]

[Outro]
My love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on
I gave you a really good feeling all day long
