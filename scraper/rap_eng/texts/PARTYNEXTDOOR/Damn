[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
If you love me go and show it to me only
Passion, passion, passion, passion, I need passion
Thought forever meant forever, baby, god damn
I was trying to make this better baby, god damn
Brr, God damn
Grr, God damn
Whoa, God damn
Whoa, God damn

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Left me alone in the skreets
Now you done woken the beast
All these GG snakes on me
Shopping spree after shopping spree I go
I go, yeah, should have seen the sign
Hence love's blind, I guess danger gets me excited
I am on a threesome diet right now, baby
I'm taking trips to Miami traveling down seven keys
Ducking off, sipping Grey Geese
Never thought you bring these actions out me
Never thought you had my head on a leash
Never thought you had my heart tryna leak out
Saying things I never speak about

[Bridge: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'ma handle it just like a man
Popping bottles just because I can
Ain't gone never change who I am
Kumbaya, I'ma still do my dance
And handle mine
I'ma handle mine, you're not mine
But God damn, it's about time you define what we is

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
If you love me go and show it to me only
Passion, passion, passion, passion, I need passion
Thought forever meant forever, baby, god damn
I was trying to make this better baby, god damn
Brr, God damn
Grr, God damn
Whoa, God damn
Whoa, God damn

If you love me go and show it to me only
Passion, passion, passion, passion, I need passion
Thought forever meant forever, baby, god damn
I was trying to make this better baby, god damn
Brr, God damn
Grr, God damn
Whoa, God damn
Whoa, God damn


[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
FÃ©r!
[?] a big savage [?]
They said you used to be the one that used to two step, baby
But I'm too rich for that to happen, whoa whoa
Like Ali, I'ma bounce back off the ropes
In my Jordan year, Jordan with the tongue
In my Kobe year, hitting 81
And I'm going gold, find a badder one
Let the check blow, now that's platinum
I'ma recoup, buy the blue coupe
Bought a new house, that's a new roof
I'ma make lemonade out of lemons, got a sweet tooth
And I learn from my truths
And learn from my last
And learn from my past
I knew this won't last
Just tell me quick fast

[Bridge: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
So I can handle it just like a man
Popping bottles just because I can
Ain't gone never change who I am
Kumbaya, I'ma still do my dance
And handle mine
I'ma handle mine, you're not mine
But God damn, it's about time you define what we is

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
If you love me go and show it to me only
Passion, passion, passion, passion, I need passion
Thought forever meant forever, baby, god damn
I was trying to make this better baby, god damn
Brr, God damn
Grr, God damn
Whoa, God damn
Whoa, God damn

If you love me go and show it to me only
Passion, passion, passion, passion, I need passion
Thought forever meant forever, baby, god damn
I was trying to make this better baby, god damn
Brr, God damn
Grr, God damn
Whoa, God damn
Whoa, God damn
