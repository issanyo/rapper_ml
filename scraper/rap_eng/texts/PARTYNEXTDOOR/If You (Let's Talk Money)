[Verse 1]
Go and throw that ass back
Go and clap, clap for me
Ooh where you learn to dance like that
Climb up on the pole, pole for me
Let's talk money
I'mma throw these ones tell the DJ keep this on repeat
Shawty let's talk money
Baby tonight forget about your man, come and keep the focus on me
Let's talk money
Ya how low can you
Back that ass up baby girl whine slow
Let's talk money
Tell me how like it, like it baby
Tell me how like it, like it baby

[Chorus]
If you weren't all over the stripper pole
I probably make you my girl
If you weren't all up in the videos
I probably make you my world
But since everybody knows
Knows your face when you come too close
And everything fades away
I-I-I still got pick up when my conscious called
My niggas probably done seen it all
But only if you

[Verse 2]
I pop a roll I sip it slow at night where do you go
She say oh well I'm a night nurse at the TO General
Well don't you need comfortable sneaks, where them scrubs that you own
While when we talk about money you just talk about your own
I know nursing don't pay that good
Filter pictures and he said that's a tattoo on your foot
And if you say no then I believe you
Not cause I have to cause I need to  (let's talk money
My conscious says no, my dick say wear something see through
If your station don't come back then I guess shawty we cool
I pop a roll, I sip it slow

[Chorus]
If you weren't all over the stripper pole
I probably make you my girl
If you weren't all up in the videos
I probably make you my world
But since everybody knows
Knows your face when you come too close
And everything fades away
I-I-I still got pick up when my conscious called
My niggas probably done seen it all
But only if you
