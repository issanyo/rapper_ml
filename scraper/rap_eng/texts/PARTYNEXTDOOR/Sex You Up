[Hook]
Take off your clothes
Who is in control?
Come on lay down down down
Let's get to it
Let's skip all the small talk
Really wanna sex you up
Really wanna sex you up

[Verse 1]
Tell me that you're mine right now and maybe
I'll work a little magic
Work a little magic
Tryna creep through your living room but I'm deeper than I thought
Cause my pockets full of knots

[Bridge]
And I know that it turns you on
To see that I'm on and I'm honest
Put some liquor in your tummy
Know you want it
Know you want this
Girl I wanna see you so

[Hook]
Take off your clothes
Who is in control?
Come on lay down down down
Let's get to it
Let's skip all the small talk
Really wanna sex you up
Really wanna sex you up

[Verse 2]
Giddy giddy
My little pony, yuh
Ride me ride me like a cowgirl
Tell me what it feel like
Tell me if you like it

[Bridge]
And I know that it turns you on
To see that I'm on and I'm honest
Put some liquor in your tummy
Know you want it
Know you want this
Girl I wanna see you so

[Hook]
Take off your clothes
Who is in control?
Come on lay down down down
Let's get to it
Let's skip all the small talk
Really wanna sex you up
Really wanna sex you up
