(Protect me)

[Sample]
(It's never too late to start over)

[Verse 1]
(Before I die)
I wanna set mines' soul straight
Should never have to pay another light bill late
Everything great
Male-born steaks on the grill on the estate, right by the lake
(Before I die)
I wanna travel the world and see things
Instead of livin illegal, livin the street dream
They say it's hard to imagine
Since so many fears go out in that fashion
(Before I die)
I wanna have a wife and kids
To tell in detail of the life we live
Half-ashamed of the things we did
Some friends dead, some friends with beards
(Before I die)
I wanna make peace with God
Instead of braking my neck tryin to keep the job
They say dreams come true
Before I go, these things I must do

[Cuts & Scratches]
(Done some things bad, done some things good)
(Blow your mind, the soul is getting me awful)
(From the beginning to the ending, I am not to lose)
(One day we'll rule the game, in the game of Hip-Hop)

[Verse 2]
(Before I die)
I want big cars, Cuban cigars
Doin' lunch with the stars
Luxory hotels and five-star suites
Play-off ball games and front-row seats
(Before I die)
I need Hip-Hop to rise
Instead of looking all through restless eyes
Praying for changes
Cuz nowadays cats do whatever to make it, just to be famous
(Before I die)
I need to be stable with ?S-Fro?
And add new emcees to cash check fo'
Platinum plaques and world-wide tours
Various awards in store, we want more
(Before I die)
We tryin to rebuild the hood
Where scavengers run ya' in and steal your goods
They say dreams come true
Before I go, these things I must do
(Before I die)

[Cuts & Scratches]
(Done some things bad, done some things good)
(Blow your mind, the soul is getting me aweful)
(From the beginning to the ending I am not to lose)
(One day we'll rule the game, in the game of Hip-Hop)
(In my lifetime, I did it all)
(Done somethings bad, done somethings good)
