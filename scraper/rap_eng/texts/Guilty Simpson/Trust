Who do you trust when the eye dark against you

Who so you trust, nobody with us
I got you in the ship ..on the block with a hustle could get no ..
I posted in the spot like a boss
Who so you trust, nobody with us
I got you in the ship ..on the block with a hustle could get no ..
I’m a ..motha f*ck never so so who do you trust?

Ready for whatever no matter the weather
Not many the ..
When you make some friends they broke the ..
Instead I’m stuck with ..to move up with ...
And that’s funny got a little rap money
But if you could ..you wouldn’t be so mad
