[Verse 1: Rapsody]
I've heard the tombs tunes
Dream killers like poison is how we [?]
If we succumb to rumors
How our juniors gonna know it's no lie
We can dream big and we try reach the moon
Might walk, they try to chalk, my goal's the same
Murderous, my revenge was to murder doubt like Cain
Been naval since my navel was cut from mama's vein
To sustain and I give up at the sight of some rain
Cause it ain't always sunny
But giving up ain't getting us close to much trust
It just staining my planes
Hanging in shame when you get in the game
Keep going, don't give up, let the passion remain
Refraining from easy walking away like Lil' Wayne
I'm on one, I'm on two, keep going 'til we reign
Supreme like Preme, Gangstarr is the same
Proof, giving up ain't no option
I got the world to gain
I got the world to gain
I got the world to gain

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
All I had was a dream
Of making it out of the local scene, spit sixteens
Fought my way from the things
That keep me in the ghetto
Doing the unthinkable for the green
And it seem like I never would acheive it
Still sometimes I honestly can't believe it
People told me you should get a plan B homey
The road to the right way is lonely
So I decided that I shouldn't listen to them
Same way they wouldn't listen to me if I was telling them
That their passion was not happening
Stop that and get a J-O-B
I'm stronger than that
Motivated by a higher force
I respect those that tried and lost
Way more than I respect those that never tried
I bear witness and testify
I'll never


[Verse 3: Villa]
Hey yo, I wipe my feet up on the welcome mat
Live from the Villa 'bout to bring the raw hip hop back
Pay homage to the ones that paved the way
Big up to RZA, Primo, Dilla, PR and Dr. Dre
Play old records, making beats in the basement
Sending heat to every rapper hoping for a placement
Just to say I created it, just to say that I made it
But fuck waiting
Got an empty canvas and started painting
Raw uncut dope serving beat fiends
Started with an MPC then switched to machine
Melodies in my mind, kicks and snares and dreams
Malcolm Little the album, gon' make it by any means
Villified, go right ahead and speak ill of me
Beats, rhymes and life, it was all a dream
My music and my family, that's all I need
Shout out to Chi city, I'ma always be me
