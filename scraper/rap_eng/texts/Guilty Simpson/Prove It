[Verse 1] (Guilty Simpson)
Yeah, bounce to it, bounce, yeah, London
Yeah, Guilty Simpson in the house
Foreign Beggars in the house
Boy, false town, in your yard bruv

I'm your block's nuisance
I'm like Glocks shooting
Imma riot in Detroit, I never stop looting
I throw a rock through your window, puffing my endo
Gun's to your temple, fuck with my kin folk and die
Detroit n****s multiply and reinvesting any on the coke supply
These rap cats claim that we're one and the same
But they running the game, but I'm running the game
I'm a new age Cyrus, I bum my smoke and say thanks
Pull my gun out and run you through
Get em, I bounce to a whole nother rhythm
You're off-beat and clumsy, find my where slums be
Where the crack heads, the pimp whores and bums be
And I'm just like them, I'm mad hungry
Foreign Beggars in the house with berretas in your mouth
Get the cheddar then we out

[Chorus] (Guilty Simpson)
I pull run thick, a lotta dudes talk shit
But it's all nonsense to me (prove it)
They're just fronting for my peeps out in London
On the way back down to the D (show how we do it)
Guilty Simpson's in the house, Foreign Beggars' in the house
Detroit City's in the house, London, England's in the house

[Verse 2] (Metropolis)
Man I'm always at large in night clubs and bars
Where rich folk hang out and light up cigars
When they're paying for their drinks I'll be lurking in the dark
With them wandering fingers that will splurt with your cars
Grand theft auto, you'll get turfed out your car
Clean out your yard like my first name was Mark
So lock your windows and your doors
Cos I'll be coming round blud
Could be in the early eve while you're out on the booze
Or in the afternoon while you're try'na catch a snooze
I'll be bagging up your goods in a fat swag bag
I ain't got shit, so really I ain't got shit to lose
I got your house plans scribbled in a diagram
You're on the 12th floor, cool, well Imma bust a Spiderman
So if you think you're shit is safe you'd better think again bruv

[Chorus] (Guilty Simpson)
I pull run thick, a lotta dudes talk shit
But it's all nonsense to me (prove it)
They're just fronting for my peeps out in London
On the way back down to the D (show how we do it)
Guilty Simpson's in the house, Foreign Beggars' in the house
Detroit City's in the house, London, England's in the house

[Verse 3] (Orifice Vulgatron)
Yeah, we can say I've been known to pack heat
I move keys of crack to fiends in back streets
But, been a couple places where hell and earth meets
Seen meat turned freaks can squirt like burst leaks
Seen urges turned deep, move work to earn keeps
By work I mean food, that's food you can't eat
Cos food you can't eat makes Gs so fuck Ps
Cos Ps mean to Gs that ain't dealing with keys
I never back down, I've proceeded to put the smack down
Independent, yes, but never been in the background
It's Foreign Beggars, GS blessed the track
And again we spread fear like pipe bombs and black clouds
I'm in your house like bazoo in the crack crowds
Raps are danker than raps you in his black bowls
It's Orifice up in your bitch, with his dick up in your bitch
Get the chips and then we split

[Chorus] (Guilty Simpson)
I pull run thick, a lotta dudes talk shit
But it's all nonsense to me (prove it)
They're just fronting for my peeps out in London
On the way back down to the D (show how we do it)
Guilty Simpson's in the house, Foreign Beggars' in the house
Detroit City's in the house, London, England's in the house
