Listen, get money, big dummy

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Uno, dos, tres, quatro
Hugo Boss, the threads is macho
Small time, hundred twenty five grand rapper
Raw rhymer, gun in my hand fam, clap ya
Way back, when Ma$e rapped, gat and one case
Sniff that, we act laid back and gun play (P!)
A murder-matician
Magician with words, observe the diction
Play this shit on the radio
Parade this shit and then pay me dough
I'm trying to sell out
Sold out shows and sold out stores
I'm a pocket full of crack that I sold outdoors
Now a nigga thinking the bigger picture, Kodak flow
I'm Dundah, pah Dunbar Olegma[???}
??? and the African race[???}
This the New Yaku[?] flow
Decease your speech, decrease the peace
Piece of shit, I'm at peace with this
Contract breached, contact two piece on street, P!

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Uh, what it do, nigga?
Fresh Wallys on the Don, Sean is a rude nigga
Few figure the style, your style ain't new nigga
Go Jesus and a tre-deuce to shoot niggas
Kinda young when RUN made hits like that
Knife and gun fight like duke I'll be right back
Listen, came back in a half an hour
Aim gats when I clap them cowards, P
The wig be responding, fire
You get fired, Avery Johnson
Trife niggas that be broker than spouse
For life, nigga, Brooklyn in the house
P, bar-for-bar the best bar-barian Sean
Arm double Leg Arm Head and the Don
Head from a broad, duke I was the head of the class
You got a lot of a kids but I'm better at math, P

[Verse 3: Guilty Simpson]
I could care less if you got a spare vest
Give it to your homie, let him try it on
I'm aiming at craniums, never try a don
Who you spying on?
I crease fools with the iron on
Great Lakes, we don't fuck with the snakes
Punch rappers to sleep, then I punch them awake
Fuck around and get found slumped in the lake
Dead man floating
I never meant flesh, his fuckin' leg came open
What you rep fool? I'm your mother's play brother
You niggas are my nephews, check who?
Run up on me [??]
You must be drinking absinthe, smoking salvia blunts
Punch chumps cause they talk too much
Look at my kicks, you can tell I don't walk too much
But let me find out where your bitches live
Some niggas change tunes when you show up at their crib, yeah
