OPENING CHORUS (ZotheJerk)

When I say my negus
I wrote this for all my negus
Don't tell what to say to my negus
'Cause 'imma keep it real, we all got my negus

VERSE 1 (ZotheJerk)

I was born black baby
Maybe by the time I turn eighteen I'll be considered an equal
I was told I was an endangered species, treated like faeces, walking dead trying to avoid demons trying eat me
And this 40 cal are drinking buddies
Clouding my judgement emotions got me thinking muddy
Bleach beach is only for colored yet green is the color most of us kill for or die for or lie for
Deceiving our own interest with nothing to rely on but hustle and muscle
Shuck and shuffle, work and duffle, if you ain't us fuck you
If you're a human I don't trust you, send niggas to touch you
So it's ride or be rode on flashbacks of bombs falling on black Wall Street this all me not them
Mediocre rhymes dance and feminine fashion trends it's the return of strong black men

CHORUS REPEATED (ZotheJerk)

VERSE 2 (Guilty Simpson)

They told me I was nothing
And even when struggling we remain hustling
Penny pinching
Making it happen without any mention
Multiple job juggling putting doubles in
Time and half
'Til we figured that rhyme was the path
Happy that
I got my game in this habitat and I never had to act
Even though I'm hated 'cause I'm black and I ain't afraid to say it on track
Unapologetic
All my negus get it
We gotta' be precise 'cause life don't have edits
You wanna' take our history from us and credits
Keep the black man down
Now you wanna' tell us how to talk when talking to our own kind
Control the black man mouth
Listen

CHORUS REPEATED (ZotheJerk)

VERSE 3 (ZotheJerk)

Pusher peddle for lack of a better avenue
Creative turning avenues to revenue
Elated seeking a better quality of life
We made it sacrificing honesty and right
But no matter the circumstance we survivors
Populated a planet and in due time it'll all make sense
No need to wince hence
Life evolves regardless, does that make sense
In our quest for chips morals evaporate quick
Went from beautiful black ladies to a ho' or a bitch
Black households behold no father in it
Outlook is bleek most felons calling it quits
So it's ride or be rode on flashbacks of bombs falling on black Wall Street this all me not them
Mediocre rhymes dance and feminine fashion trends it's the return of strong black men

CHORUS REPEATED (ZotheJerk)
