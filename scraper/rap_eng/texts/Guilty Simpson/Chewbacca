[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Chewbacca
Duece-duece Papa now rocking your shoes proper
True shotta, nigga you noose nada
My three versus your four, who crew's hotter, Random
Everbody on my team is winners
Everybody on your team beginners
Why you do that, rapper
Fucking new-jack rappers
Flinch when I walk by cause I do smack rappers
Sean the Barbarian
Deadly dose of the dope shit, black tar heroin
The best out, bar-for-bar Pa
His god given talent scream Al hum du'Allah
You got no skills, you got no talent
You're shit no frills and your bitch toss salad
Niggas rap albums sound like love letters
Pen in my hand like, damn fam, I can do much better

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
I write classics, you can't hack it
You know what it is
In the room with the floor covered in plastic
Passive, never got a street-cat pay so I'm active
Stay back
I keep that blade
Hi, hater
I'll carve a smile right next to your frown like laugh now, cry later
Potato on the barrel
French-fry ten guys
For major violations, call it annihilation
Your tough talk, I don't get it
You wouldn't fight a ticket
So why recite a lyric
Especially when lyrics get a rifle at your fitted
I'm sure to buck so tell Pac what up though
My foes better be real
You wanna be tough, alright you'll forever be still
Still I get nicer, yet I'll ice you
And rhyme with the force of a Jedi cyhper

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Roc Marciano]
Marcberg, baby fire it off
Split your cabbage
Bitch ass rappers spit garbage
Live lavish, Mac-10's under big jackets
Hit me a pass, flip that mattress
Remember the patterns
Five stay dipping in traffic
Parle stiff in the cabin
With axes, dismember a faggot
Limbs is scattered and littered with maggots
Splashed with gas, we lit up matches
That's for acting real tepid and passive
Ya'll asking to give out passes
I pull up, get out Astons
But never without ratchets
Busters feel our wrath and
Butlers will fill our glasses
Brothers ain't up in our bracket
Slugs from the gattling, spin out rapping
Flip the casket, lyrics is crafted
Hit them with the plastic and then I'll pass it
