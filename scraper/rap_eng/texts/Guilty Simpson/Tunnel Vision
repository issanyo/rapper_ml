[Intro]
Get in the ship, we're about to take off!
OK, I, I'm coming
Here we go, up, up and away!

[Verse 1]
(One, two, two, two)
(Beats to Dabrye)
(Jealous shit)
Yo, uh, without fame, I'm making the rhyme hall
Spiked slimeballs, peddlin' signoffs
Tryna eat off the plate like wide balls
Razor the back of the blunt, no [?]
Fire, it don't get no flyer
Vodka, splash of papaya
No, I don't preach to the choir
Even when my life look dire
I kept that tunnel vision, money mission
Peace to my bloodline [?]
We need them plates, all fixin's
We need sides and all, survived every rise and fall
The best daddy
Screamin' "Fuck 'em all!" like a sex addict
More ties than a dress jacket
I clean up good, I'm doin' dirt wit' the dirt doers
In a beat up hood', Guilt'

[Interlude]
We out there
[?]
Get it together, get it together
[?]
Get it together, get it together

[Verse 2]
Yo, uh, yo, I told y'all I'm special
Unique, one of one, none other, run for cover
Baby motherfucker
Wit' yo better half rollin' grams
Raise arms like a show of hands
So advanced, I'm deep wit' it
You should roll ya pants up
Pickup stronger than a Dodge Ram truck
Wit' the weight in the back, we take what we lack
Catch me in the club wit' the greats pourin' 'gnac
Like we own the joint, truth tellers
Never affected by the new sellers
Same shit in a new get up
I tell my engineer, "Loop that up
And go in like it's flu weather."
AD's the family, no crew's better
I bet that against whoever [?]
