[Intro] (Guilty Simpson)
G.S. boy
O.J. Simpson

[Verse 1] (Guilty Simpson)
Listen, do your research
My name rings bells on heavy block
You're lame, your splash in the game was a belly-flop
I'm a grouch, boxing rappers like a kangaroo
Heater in my pouch, throw away under my couch
Crooked and mad, you disrespectful mutherfuckers is cooking with gas
Bon appetit, I go at your streets
With aggression, the same way I go at a beat and wreck sessions
Then shoot a load on your freak in Best Western
She's a hotel rat, I'm the shit bitch go tell that
Yeah I hit it in the telly and came on the belly and remixed the celly
I left no tracks
When your bones go crack I ask "it hurt don't it"?
My hobby is to body every one of my opponents

[Hook] (Guilty Simpson)
I put em' in their best clothes, family members crying
Front row with fresh robes, playing with my escro
Put you on death row, Hood Sentence, Good Riddance
O.J. Simpson muhfuckers

[Verse 2] (Guilty Simpson)
You can't save everybody
So I ante on another shotty and vow to never let a rapper stop me
They copy, but take it as a hobby
Timid, while I go get it
That's right, who's sucker-free, no more drama
Cause these motherfuckers got no honour, OK

[Hook] x 2 (Guilty Simpson)
I'mma put em in their best clothes, family members crying
Front row with fresh robes, playing with my escro
Put you on death row, Hood Sentence, Good Riddance
I'mma put em in their best clothes, family members crying
Front row with fresh robes, playing with my escro
Put you on death row, Hood Sentence, Good Riddance, Yeah, Good Riddance

[Verse 3] (Guilty Simpson)
They couldn't hold a candle to the rhyme catalyst
Detroit Rap, Blunt rap with a Cali twist
Madlib keep skunk, all flavours for the smokers
O.J. Simpson, game over, then flame doja
Black lungs, I could rob these rappers with a cap gun
Prolly, pistol-whip foes til' they groggy
Forever young even when I'm gone, get CD and start at one
And recapture the life, it could have been a disaster
Instead you hear victory, in every chapter
The gutter gave birth to a hip-hop saviour
But even above all about my paper
Dope enough to be an urban legend
But real enough to do dirt and hide a murder weapon

[Hook] x 2 (Guilty Simpson)
I'mma put em in their best clothes, family members crying
Front row with fresh robes, playing with my escro
Put you on death row, Hood Sentence, Good Riddance
I'mma put em in their best clothes, family members crying
Front row with fresh robes, playing with my escro
Put you on death row, Hood Sentence, Good Riddance
Good Riddance
