[88-Keys: Intro]

Ain't goin down like that
I just would not do that
Ain't that right Guilty Simpson?
Shouts to the D
Rest in peace to my man J Dilla

[Verse: Guilty Simpson]

Don't fucking talk to me like for real...I'm a man don't talk to me like that

Yo
I wanna watch the game but you tryna run game to you
Life's an arcade, spend my change bitch but no I'm not playin'
I'm serious and it goes without sayin'
You're furious
Face balled up, pissed off cause we chillin'
You wanna be gone, I wanna be home
The Pistons in the zone, my lady's in her feelings
Talkin' all wrong please watch your tone
Here we go again the routine
Last time you screamed all night and threw things
And I ain't give a fuck I let you yell and blew greens
Picture that
The problem's we don't add up figure that
You plus me is not the move, try it on him I'm not the dude
Say I'm insensitive to how you feel
But when's the last time I had a home-cooked meal
Keep it real I hate to shout
Why take you out when I'd rather tape your mouth
You wanna party and play the town and do your rounds
But I'd much rather play the house
I speak direct, you don't understand
The more that I do the more you demand
Workin' my nerves forcin' my hand
Twistin' every word I'm sayin'
Damn
You worshipped my word and had faith
Then lost the faith and went apes
You want me to turn water to wine
You reject it when I feed your mind
Stupid

[88-Keys: Outro]
