[Intro:]
Yeah!  You were [Uh!] you was
Yeah! Set up
You were you was
Big you, explicit one
You were you was, X one
You were you was
Shit crazy out here, yo

[Verse 1:]
You could tell a chopper bullets spinning like a helicopter
Get you red like a teleprompter you can't tell a author
Divorced the game she at the altar never falter
Her rocks like Gibraltar is my house you just a squad of plotter
Get slaughter I have you drowning in a cup of water
Hard body you looking soft
Running yo mouth from hooking off spit that sick shit whooping cough
Exhaust the floss toss the boss shit costs
Get in ma head  you get lost
You don't see the judge you see the magistrate
Don't study me dog you won't graduate
You acting like a boy that's moody
Blow fish hoodie boss in the Djibouti
A hip hop soldier on the tour of duty
Our Asian corruption beats you from beauty it's Edo G

[Chorus:]
You were you was [x4]

[Verse 2:]
Check!
I shake up the world and make you disappear
After sketch rappers reformed  gun clapper
I used to run laps through Detroit like a track meet
Athlete's ab too, You were you was
You gon mag who. Just the threat alone got me in the zone on the telephone
Calling up ma home growns
In the night like Nikes with chrome on
Fuck around ma peoples might double down
Put a couple on yo crown when we hustle through your town
Ma strong hand will knuckle every clown
Move in silence and muffle ever sound
I don't conform I confront smoke on blunts and make quota every month
Don't try me the soldiers in the front line
And I gotta tell em one time “get him”

[Chorus]
