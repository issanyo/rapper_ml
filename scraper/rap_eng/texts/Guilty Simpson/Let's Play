[Verse 1:]
She said she typically would be opposed
(To what?)
To a stranger talking her up out her clothes
(She tryna fuck)
Is she talking truthful? I don't know
Either way, let's take this party on the road
Let's go!
We're sipping on what we would like to know
It ain't your business, just let me paint the pictures
She burning up, while your homie burnin' swishers
She broken up over Guilty, so let me fix her
A tick here, a tick there
Now she's ready to get hot and heavy
But whenever goin steady
Yeah, we're steady going to the telly
Put something on her belly, and something in her belly

[Bridge:]
And after I enter, I get dementia
It's not a thing
(To what?)
To tell a chick I forgot her name
I know they're saying that it's not a game
But when these broads get excited
It damn sure feels like it

[Hook:]
Let's play
Let's play!
Let's play!
Let's play!
Let's play!
Yeah, let's, let's play!

[Verse 2:]
Watch me catch her!
She's staring at my crotch like a picture!
Waiting for the signal, so she could throw it at me, she's nasty, Staring at my zipper
I met her on (?)
Thought I would of struck out, but naw
She showed me that dug out
Dancing like a stripper
She show me that pole, she showed me that hole
The kung-fu gripper, woh
Damn, I gotta show
I hate, I gotta go
She got me coming back for another at bat
But I know the role, we keep is simple, I'll leave it at that

[Bridge:]
But after winter, not a thing
To tell the chick I forgot her name
I know they're saying that it's not a game
But when these broads get excited
It damn sure feels like it

[Hook:]
Let's play
Let's play!
Let's play!
Let's play!
Let's play!
