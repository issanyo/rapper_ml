[Verse 1]
I’m The D yeah
Detroit shit yo
Check me
I’m from the motor city
Phat killers and Goon Squad is rolling with me
A lot of friends and acquaintances is coexisting
Keep it unified for you and I to go and get the
Crown for the motortown and we took a sticky
My shooters holding fifties
And if he approach they know to clip him
Stressed out for the folks to get him
Five o' leaving four to five for the picking
Up from the cold concrete there’s so many
Stories of bloodshed fighting over pennies

[Chorus]
I’m talking about [x7]
Detroit
I’m talking about [x8]
Detroit

[Verse 2]
Yeah I’m from the motor city
Hex Murda and Black Milk is rolling with me
A lot of friends and acquaintances is coexisting
We keep it unified for you and I to go and get the
Fucking title now we got our rivals moving sickly
Those subliminal shots they didn’t even nick me
And now my eyes are wide open I can see the envy
And now my eyes are wide open I can see the enemy
Red flags I know there’s plenty
Left behind but pay no mind I’m going friendly

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
That’s what we’re talking about
That’s what we’re talking about
We talking about survival and brothers and sisters
We gonna survive America
I’m from the renaissance
D-Twizzy and Dread Nas they still my dawgs
The bystanders are standing by I should get involved
I’m still repping though I know it’s been a minute y’all
And I know a lot of people wanna kill the cause
Those subliminal jabs I didn’t feel at all
And I know that they mad because we did it all
And I noticed they mad because they hit a wall
Shit we hit the jackpot then we live it all
Get back at it
For Dilla dawg

[Chorus]
