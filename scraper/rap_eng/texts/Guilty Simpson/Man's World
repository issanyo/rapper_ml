[Intro]
All I ever did was love you man
All I ever wanted you to do was love me
I'm a part of you

[Verse 1]
This is a man's world
That's what my old man told me
In the living room listening to the oldies
Playing dominoes drinking shots of stolies
With his friends we refer to them homies
Drug dealers and addicts some parolees
Pimps and mac superflys and goldies
I remember everything the cat showed me
How to kick it with the females and roll weed
It seems pop took more time to scold me
I figured that was his little way to control me
Through hard times he never did console me
His daddy I bought his old colby
I was his son but you didn't really know me
I lived life pretending things was rosy
Standing firm on the concrete below me
A part of you old dude low and behold me

[Refrain]
Everything is yours this a man's world
Now get your ass off the phone with them damn girls
Chasing nuts the downfall of the damn squirrel
Get your head in them books man
Stand up straight and look in my eye
I'm hard on you cause I love you
And that's no lie
I'm sorry about the bruise on your face understand
You're still my son I'm still your old man

[Verse 2]
I don't really understand everything I do
So please help me out I'm like you part 2
My old dude was something to see
My only idol everything I wanted to be
All I want to know is what you wanted from me
I did more right than wrong
And that's the reason I write this song
It's therapy for my mind while I light the bong
Shit hurts, but I feel like life goes on
Be a man suck it up
By fifteen I'm ducking left hooks and uppercuts
I fought back in many ways it made me toughen up
Surely it's the reason this limited love with us
It's something I won't get past soon
That's real proof that time don't heal all wounds
But still I learned a lot you see
When I have a son now I know how not to be

[Refrain]
