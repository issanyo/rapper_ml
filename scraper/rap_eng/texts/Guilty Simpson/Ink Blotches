[Verse 1]
Surprise, my peoples are suited for street ties
But never slacking
Get a blazer for when it happens
I'm reflecting, they're rapping
I'm working, they're napping
Rest well
My pen is compressed Hell
Since sex sells, I'm filming your chick [?] my sex sell
I break it good like a fresh L
Make it hood but I dress well
Spotless
I charge for my ink blotches
That's how I keep deep pockets
And you wonder why your freak watches
I don't need watches
The wrist stay G shockless
Yet I'm still on time
You could never kill of mine
I deal off lines
Travel the world, still pay my bills on time
I handle business
Rep with a .357 like Hammer bitches
Or maybe the K, banana clipping

[Hook] {x4}
I charge fr my ink blotches, my ink blotches
That's how I keep deep pockets

[Verse 2]
I keep it real for people that keep it real with the people
And I don't really care if you're illegal or living legal
I used to speak with heat from the beak of a Desert Eagle
And now I travel seas with a gang of people to speak to
I came along
Wait to get on
I wavered the storm
Now I'm payed with the form
I was destined for the shit since the day I was born
And now they checking for my shit and I'm breaking the norm
I'm out here, living without fear
Living without cares
Without a doubt in there
You shouldn't run your mouth near
We hear it all
We got clout here
We got eyes and ears everywhere
We ain't letting shit slide this year
I rep for the realest
Respect for my killers in front and ain't letting shit die this year
C'mon

[Hook]
