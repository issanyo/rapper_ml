Good shit...

[Guilty Simpson]
Crack, E, Powder, Weed
No matter what it is they got what you need
Young cats serving bags from ten speeds
I guess money does grow on trees
Kush, Gas, Dro, and Regs
Drop a few crumbs for the hoes to beg
You better learn the game and know the ledge
Dudes round here put holes in heads
Got cash to blow
Dog got ziplock bags of snow
And those that keep E work is swoll
Chicks pop them hoes like birth control
The whole game is buy and sell
Keep the clientele high as hell
Some dudes jump in, try, and fail
Get locked up and tell...

All the hustlas
Let me see your foot work
Them young boys around the corner got purp
Right next door where homie got murked
When he met dude, he copped and got jerked
Let me see your foot work/
Don't go down the street, they got dirt
Right next door where the girl got murked
When she ain't do old boy, he got hurt

[Guilty Simpson]
Shrooms, Cigs, Meth, and Hash
Whatever's gon get that extra cash
A1 products in sandwich bags
Plate so fat they can't be mad
Rain, hail, snow, or sun
The whole neighborhood got the 411
If you snitch they'll bust a gun
Stomp on your face and bust yo gums
You better ask around
Them drug boys sewed up half the town
Fearless, ain't no backing down
The whole crew's packing pounds
Ones that you smoke and ones that smoke you
And everyone knows who you should go to
But you need someone to go through
Don't knock if they don't know you...
