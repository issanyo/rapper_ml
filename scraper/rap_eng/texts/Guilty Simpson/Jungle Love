[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
Prolific flow, like blow, sniff it
Get zooted, banging that dope music
My mind is set, this year niggas better step it up
I get the job done way before the check is cut
I don't write raps for free
If I did, I won't make it like Shaq from three
My motto is simple
Without that loot your instrumentals stay instrumentals
A blind man could see the kid's potential
And take notice so I grind and stay focused
If I was any hotter, I'd drink straight vodka
Spit out flames, and piss lava
That hot fam, try again
That's why I got hoes like firemen
You could plug 'em up to hydrants
I should push a big red truck with sirens
Got a flow that'll stop beginners
I maul y'all a shopping center
Every time I yell I say
J Detroit I to the L-L-A

[Chorus]
J Detroit I to the L-L-A (Repeat x4)

With that raw shit
Turn it up loud in your car shit
Finger tips split that cigar shit
Let's smoke nigga
Holler at your mans, I'll blow with ya
(Repeat x2)

J Detroit I to the L-L-A (Repeat x4)

[Verse 2: M.E.D]
I bang nothing but that raw shit
Neighbors bang on the wall pissed from the noise and the blunt scent
With a chick getting blown like a trumpet
For wondering how I stand still and still run this
Full stomach, hunger in the eyes, greedy
In your speezy take shit like nigga you don't need these
Titles and mics, homey you don't need these
My CD's tight like six niggas in a Sea Breeze
I flow so sick and won't sneeze
Sack hold craps with no cheese
Rap Gs, rubberband one hand I part your gold teeth
J Dilla my nigga I call him OG
The street symphony, epitome
The underdogs who grind hard for the victory
Get them weak rhymes outta my face
I clap 16 bars that might catch me a case
I'm back, don't stop til my lungs collapse
Till then close your eyes, nigga, imagine that
