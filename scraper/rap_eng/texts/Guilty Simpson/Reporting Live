(Verse 1)

I grew up in the ghetto of [?] Avenue
In the hood when drug dealin' was natural
And if you messed up a package
Niggas came after you
Bust a nine at you
And beat you 'till you was black and blue
This here is factual
Fairy tales are nonexistent
Like the American Dream
Cause I ain't ever lived it ( Nope )
But I emerge
Just like the Jews in the Holocaust
Here to spit the truth
In the Booth
Live for all of y'all
Hot as a molotov
Burnin' down your residence
Cause revolution is evident
If it's ever been
I'm embezzlin' real shit through the internet
Cause all the channels are [?]
This here is rebel music
Fight the impression music
Something to live and die for
That kind of music
So to all of my soldiers
It's time to lock and load
As I explode on this mic(ro)phone
To take control

(Hook)

Reporting live from the gritty blocks of rock city
Forgotten sound of Motown
But used by many
Rappers come a dime a dozen but not many
Can carry the status so let's just hope that y'all hear me
Reporting live from the gritty blocks of rock city ( Detroit )
Forgotten sound of Motown
But used by many
Rappers come a dime a dozen but not many ( Listen )
Can carry the status so let's just hope that y'all hear me

(Verse 2)

It's the crib
The place where I live
Where I was born and where I would die
Tough guys break ties and turn cold
Lost souls
Chicks given head to get her purse swole
Blow your top off like Kurt Co-
Bang
Stay in your lane
Everybody runs gangs
So once said
Take it in vain
Young killas' take it in blood
Dirt doers get wet up
And then the pigs come play in the mud (Uh)
It's bitter sweet
When I think of Detroit
Turned away
Party goers dump a clip in the joint
Bystanders pray to God a niggas missin' his point
But he don't know[?]
Left another mess for the popo
That's why I'm well prepared
Put me anywhere
And I'll survive
I keep the heat in the ride
For the carjackers
Clutchin' black 9s
Still I rep the Motor City in all of my rap lines
I love it

(Hook)
Reporting live from the gritty blocks of rock city
Forgotten sound of Motown
But used by many
Rappers come a dime a dozen but not many
Can carry the status so let's just hope that y'all hear me
Reporting live from the gritty blocks of rock city
Forgotten sound of Motown
But used by many
Rappers come a dime a dozen but not many
Can carry the status so let's just hope that y'all hear me

(Verse 3)

I'm a dominant species
Just like a male lion
So when I roar
You can't ignore
I'm hard as iron
King of the jungle
Smackin' up the hyena breed
Type of emcee
With the speed
Of a centipede
I exceed to the [?] of the outer limits
Here
Gifted with lyrics
That's motivatin' the realest
Got a team of guerrillas
A little stronger than silver bats
Titanium spines
Make them stronger than juggernauts
I'm takin' over
Spittin to the Apollo drum (That's mine)
Vibratin' the city streets
For years to come
The outcome
X out the little like I was Malcolm
I scoped you
With the vision of soarin' falcons
Markin' terrain
As I'm changin' the game
Damagin' mind frames
As I'm spittin' the flame
By my Lord's permission
I'ma reign supreme
Takin' hip hop to the essence
From which it came (came)

(Hook)
Reporting live from the gritty blocks of rock city
Forgotten sound of Motown
But used by many
Rappers come a dime a dozen but not many
Can carry the status so let's just hope that y'all hear me
Reporting live from the gritty blocks of rock city
Forgotten sound of Motown
But used by many
Rappers come a dime a dozen but not many
Can carry the status so let's just hope that y'all hear me
