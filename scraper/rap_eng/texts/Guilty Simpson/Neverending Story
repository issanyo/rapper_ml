And I know what time it is

A lot of these young casting they know it all
I doubt that
Yeah, check it all

I've been around for a minute
It's like I saw it all and I finally in it
Wisdom achieved and doing what I believe
And I plan it do more before I'm finished
One go man another sack it's never enough
And when it's all done I'm settled enough
I'm living the life out of mind, out of sight
Out of spite, they say is trying to messin it up
But I'm a man free ballin from the heights of unreachable plans
But I want 'cause I took a chance
So when I land I never have the whole regret
And I earn respect for who I am
Now that's real, realer than the rap deal
I saw many cast lose it all for this music
Yeah I'm taking how the death feel
God day it is gift so use it, come on

You can't tell me nothing, you listen up
I'm tryin to say you something come on
And I know what time it is
You can't tell me nothing, now listen up, listen up
Yall

I had a need for more, so my ceiling became a floor
For everyone shots I know this the door
Opportunity let me in when the rain poured, I'm thankful
I used to feel hateful and nothing grateful
But now I'm doing tours, I had to let go
And except the faith chosen, enjoy the moment
It wasn't store, I'm still here
Many predicted I've been kill here
Shut on hood I knock on wood
Because it's strongest brothers I know is in the wheel chair
And some days I'm not so good
But the day above ground is never the worst
So a new one begins with thankin first
Then the end of story told by unique soul
The real life sand at first come on

And I know what time it is
You can't tell me nothing, now listen up
I'm tryin to say you something come on
And I know what time it is
You can't tell me nothing, now listen up, listen up

Yeah the neverending story
Not totally ready yet
Still determined in my path
