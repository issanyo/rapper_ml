[Intro]
Life itself full of struggle and wealth
Yeah, Guilty Simpson, muthafuckas
Let's go, Detroit city

[Verse 1]
We bangin' that jungle music
Homies in the hood flip bundles to it
Make exchanges to flake for wages
Hustlin' hard before the jake engages
They wanna see the apes in cages
We never conversate with agents
Anti-police to speak in layman's
I'd rather take a swim with Cayman
For real, man, fuck 'em all
That's why I flick off cops and cuff my balls
Smokin' that good shit
Your baby mama wanna fuck with that hood shit
And I'm just what she need, a gangsta breed
Yeah, break down my weed, fuck and leave
You niggas wanna buck with G's, bitch please
I seen harder kids in a Chuck E Cheese

[Hook]
Party with the baddest broads and spend change
Take 'em to the hotel suite and get brains
Gettin' bitches, gettin' riches
I'm a playa, but no, it's not a game
Outfit's crazy, watch's insane
Gettin' bitches, gettin' riches

[Verse 2]
We hustlin', don't confuse it
Money is the bread, hen dog's the fluid
Sold out stages, the love's outrageous
Swoosh on the A-1's match the laces
They wanna see the crew with cases
They tell me that I'm too abrasive
Unseen, we move evasive
We don't follow rules, we take it
And I only trust my dogs
Y'all fake that's why I don't fuck with y'all
I'm tryin' to get hood rich
So miss me with all of that bullshit
For this here I bleed, yes indeed
I'm tryin' to cop a black Range and have extra cheese
Y'all wanna test me, please bitch squeeze
I ain't hard to find man, I'm in the D

[Hook]
