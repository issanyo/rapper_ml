[Intro]
Guilty Simpson, Stone Tone
Detroit to London, Great Lakes
Worldwide
Don’t let nobody stop you man, never
Listen

[Verse 1]
A young ghetto boy with a scar face trying to be a big willy stacking my bills
Who’s known to rap a lot, and travel spots, from the lush to the Hip Hop Spot with my skills
I made away, and now it’s safe to say, that I’m playing with house money, erased the doubt from me
Now I’m hungry, Starving with a loud tummy, and travelling in and out countries
I’m a master of ceremonies, they just repeating what I said, they going to pair it on me
I never let a phoney get any leverage on me, so i go back where I’m from and keep a weapon on me
This isn’t checkers homey, it’s chess, and I won’t settle for less, 24 hours for the power never get a rest
Feeling blessed, They cheering when I say shit, They love it, When I’m spitting to the public

[Hook]
Great Lakes in this, we doing great shit, pardon my lateness
I was busy chasing after that oasis, and by fate this, my greatness
Great Lakes in this, we doing great shit, pardon my lateness
I got this far by showing I got patience, and made a statement
The way I say shit, it’s my greatness


[Verse 2]
I don’t fuck with many people 'cause they fake, they wishing you the worst, smiling in your face
It’s why I keep it moving, they only see my plates, in these Great Lakes, they can’t keep up the pace
Women hating on my lady cuz I keep her laced, they wondering what I make, they hate to see her straight
But they were happy in the past when we barely ate, I couldn’t take the weight, I was about to break
Because I couldn’t wait, Till I got a plate, I did a couple dates, did a couple shows, made a little dough
Put it somewhere safe, then I met fate, I could be great, travelled outside the States when I got a taste
Making more papes 'cause so many could relate
Venom proof to denim for these snakes, and now I’m worldwide with it and they can’t debate

[Hook x2]
