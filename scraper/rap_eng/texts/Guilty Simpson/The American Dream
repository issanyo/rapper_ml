[Verse 1]
I talk with the dead, deep, deep in my head
I'm off, I was bred where the hungry man's dead
Talk, I was led where the red man bled
And all the other things my educated friends said
Lost in the life where the young fools sped
Never should have taught him that a gun shoots lead
That crack a get his brother and sister a new bed
Addicted to the game and things, screw feds
Any day his name can change, who's Ed?
Go to the crib, new furniture, new threads
Steady sleep when he see those things
To be a drug dealer the american dream
To get paid something, go to every extreme
One black will leave another red for green
Falling for the tricks while the man deceives ya
Until the day you finally bite the hand that feeds you
C'mon

[Outro]
