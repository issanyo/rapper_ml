[Intro] [Guilty Simpson talking]:
It's good. It's called change. I got little something for you man
It's called change. Listen

[Verse One]:
With nowhere to go he's homeless
Saving for a hit of that blow
To this kids he's a no show
They only see him clean in a photo
A shell of a man that once provided
When the divorce came the kids sided
That's when the dream and life collided
Losing this family was a low blow, so
Deeper in the bottle he goes
And everyday powders his nose, he's fadin'
Heard the wife found a replacement
With a nice bank statement, he can't win
Make him want to call it quits
Get a bottle of pills and take all the shit
And when he ask, "Who's fault is this?"
And the answer came
He realized there's a chance to change, come on

[Hook]:
What do you do, with nowhere to go?
The pain of this life is killing you slow
Not too many highs, and endless lows
Nowhere to go, yeah
With nowhere to go

[Verse Two]:
Yo, nowhere to go, she's homeless
Saving for a hit of that blow
To her kids she's a no show
They only see her clean in the photo
Yeah, shell of a woman that once provided
When the divorce came the kids sided
That's when the dream and life collided
Losing the family was a low blow, so
Deeper in the bottle she goes
And every day powders her nose, she's fadin'
Heard the hubby found a replacement
With a pair of fake tits, she can't win
Makes her wanna call it quits
Get a bottle of pills and take all the shit
And when she asks, "Whose fault is this?"
And the answer came
She realized there's a chance to change, come on

[Hook]:
What do you do with nowhere to go?
Bangin to this life is killing you slow
Not too many highs endless lows
Nowhere to go, yeah
With nowhere to go

It's called change
It's called change
