[Verse 1: Ruste Juxx]
The ill diabolical fiend this mad scientist
Kill the cartel, rule the land with a iron fist
Ruste Juxx I be spitting that
Body new rappers, homie, watch who you getting at
Brrap, the bold cap snapback
I hit you with the brrat 'till your cap snap back
Further, knocking on them Pearly Gates
I'm organizing late funerals and early wakes
For any hot stepper trying to dance with the devil
Gravedigger, stand over your corpse with a shovel
Dropping dirt on it, fill it up then I'm out
They building something on the lands so now I gotta dig 'em out
Hoodfella, I rob for deniros
Too many lives lost for trying to be a hero
My patience is zero, I'm keeping it a hundred
Everytime I had a fight in my life I never fronted
I'm the realest

[Hook: Shabaam Sahdeeq]
Illest man walking, night of the living dead
Tombstone hopper, got a price on my head
Graveyard shipping, gotta keep the monsters fed
Things that go bumping at night, fool, you scared
I'm the illest man walking, night of the living dead
Tombstone hopper, got a price on my head
Graveyard shipping, gotta keep the monsters fed
Things that go bumping at night, fool, you scared

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
I spit a murder verse scary as October 31st
House keeping, streets sweeping when doing my dirty work
Marijuana sparker, playing that drum like Travis Barker
Fam, I will valet park ya
Take your keys then get that cake before you leave
Gun talk, shooting the breeze
I put a popper to your chopper drop a hundred emcees
Hard ten below, but I spit the summer degrees
That mac wind made his hat spin
There's a million mad men in my trash bin
So when I buck at you bastards
Calm your frontline, and call it a muscle relaxer
Results of my violence is silence, we all can sleep
Me home, you six feet deep
Well-known heavy hitter, whoever want it
Everytime I step to the plate, I never bund it
I'm the illest

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
I'm a product of the projects, a menace to society
My consciense thinks progress but my greed thinks violently
Give me that, run that, kill me or I come back
Taking what I wanna take, homie, I'm a scumbag
So disrespectful I know my parents taught me better than that
But couldn't keep me away from felony rap
Not talking about music, this is felony robbery
Strong arm with the uzi, intercepting the economy
Touch down, get down clown, kiss the ground
And I'm too broke to own a silencer, homie, this is loud
Matter of fact, definetely, make your ears ring
Crazy you can get shot and not feel it at first, it's a weird thing
Pass out, wake up in the emergency room
With people you never met before nursing your wounds
Your little sister crying, doctors are inserting a tube
Down your throat, oh well, nothing personal dude
Bill is the illest

[Hook]
