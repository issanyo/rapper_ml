[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
Carnivorous slang, I feast on flesh
Orangutan, banana clips, beat on chest
Dirtier than Ms. Lewinsky's skeet on dress
I'm beyond blessed, heater in the seat armrest
Defeat your leader, we the best
See the rest is just clones, hip-hop drones
Singing the same old song
Fuck with this, you can't go wrong
By these standards, I can't even put a Kangol on
My ego's big, I'm crazy, I could do Cee Lo's gigs
Kush homeboy, zero mids
Who gives a fuck who your hero is
I give that nigga a nice view of himself where he can see both lids
Bar for bar, I'm on par to spar cigars
Whole preserves coming straight from jars
You get drug like CVS
You got no buzz out of state, Metro PCS

[Hook: Black Milk]
Put it down
Coming with the... brand new sound
Put, put it down
Coming with the... brand, brand new sound
Put it down
Coming with the... brand new sound
Never back down
