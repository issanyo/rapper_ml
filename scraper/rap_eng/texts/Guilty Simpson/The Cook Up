Why hungry arms
Why the hungry arms give me all the love I need?

I was just a young fella when I saw the older dudes getting money on the block
With softball knots
Pitching to the hitters, names got bigger
Till the lady on the corner hit the cops
Lights on
The roaches scatter
I don't walk the path of your ordinary rapper
I'm loading up the clapper looking dapper
Rings on my bitch slappers
Snow season in your crib with my Nike's on
Why sacrifice when I can sacrifice you?
Like the rat you are amongst pythons
I'm cold blooded
Robin Hood style
My dawg Chance hit a lick and had the whole crew flooded
Top brass
Bring it to any weight class
Wild and fearless, scheming whoever should break bad
Watch me operating like Wayne State grab with the cook up straight from the lab

{x4}
It's the cook up
Cook up, cook up, cook up, cook up, cook up
Cooking up [?]

I was just a young man when I saw the smoking bitches
Getting money off the twat
With golf ball knots
Rolling with the swingers
Pockets got greener
Till the lady on the corner called the cops
Lights on
The roaches scatter
My peoples known to bring it to the places where you gather
No regard for stature, they'll get at ya
Rings on my chin tappers
Summer season in your crib with my Nike's on
I'm pass the hype
So whatever I do
It's a fact I starred amongst icons
You don't cut it
I fathered your style you ain't advanced
With the shit and now you know who run it
My style
Bringing it till we rake cash
Crowd is fearless, meaning whoever we make mad
Can watch me operate like a U. of D. grad
With the cook up straight from the lab
