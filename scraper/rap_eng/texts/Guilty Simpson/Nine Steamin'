[Intro]
Catch me out the six leanin', with the nine steamin'

[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
Trey eight snub, German pub, cold Pilsener
Hood hooligan, chasing paper with pilgrims
Niggas can't fuck with us
Y'all dude's soundin' like Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch
Such and such couldn't touch me if I was dusted up
Flusty in a bucket stuck, doggy
I've been the same since a fuckin' pup (What?)
You feelin' froggy, then fuckin' jump
So I can interview your inner tube with the pump
This shit will make you Kriss Kross "Jump"
Catch a lump, put a vest on your chest if you want
Still be catchin' hot ones
Buck shot spread, the buck stops here
Fucked around and left the whole bus stop air
My man's on point with them handjoints
Blammers in them bushers, we watchin' out for them androids
Thought that over here the grass was greener
See that's them demons and I can see them schemin'
Pass the Nina

[Hook: Krumbsnatcha sample]
Call priest, there's a demon in ya hood schemin'
Catch me out the six leanin, with the nine steamin'
Call priest, there's a demon in ya hood schemin'
Catch me out the six leanin, with the nine steamin'
Call priest, there's a demon in ya hood schemin'
Catch me out the six leanin, with the nine steamin'
Call priest, there's a demon in ya hood schemin'
Catch me out the six leanin, with the nine steamin'

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
Cue, uh, I'm the issue enforced, stay on the porch
We make it rain and I don't mean when the paper get tossed (tossed)
Troops know the drill, so if promoters put me on the bill (what), it's overkill, the duo
Chopppin' off your hand for the Hublot (gimme)
For tryna push a round on a sumo
Heavyweights touching every state
Eagle eye, make the Desi quake (Blah!)
Scan the block with the ready-bake
Black czars pushing fast cars
Loaded at the cash bar, who gives a fuck about a rap star?
(Who gives a fuck, nigga?)
I'm nice with the steamers
Arm's out, similar to Christ the Redeemer
Run your whole life through the cleaners (cleaners)
Fast talkers, asphalt ya, all about the cash offers
Smarten up, when the day darkens up
The gunner's wearing all black, sparking up

[Hook: Krumbsnatcha sample]
Call priest, there's a demon in ya hood schemin'
Catch me out the six leanin', with the nine steamin'
Call priest, there's a demon in ya hood schemin'
Catch me out the six leanin', with the nine steamin'
Call priest, there's a demon in ya hood schemin'
Catch me out the six leanin', with the nine steamin'
Call priest, there's a demon in ya hood schemin'
Catch me out the six leanin', with the nine steamin'

[Outro]
Yeah, grimy shit, you know what I mean?
That's the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout, man
