[Intro: Guilty Simpson]

Yo yo, Guilt Simpson, Audible Doctor what's good?
Check me out one time...

[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]

Reporting live, from behind the 45
Fortified with the rhyme I'm immortalized
Pouring wine pinot noir
Then speak those bars, only seen through foreign eyes
Touring sides of the world that's seldom seen
So hail the king and turn the dream into the only prize
Homie I've, elevated the craft, generated the math, celebrated my wrath
Surprise
I'm so unapologetic, keep your bread I want credit
I could pen you some sin and send it to your favorite rapper
Or just keep it, and give it to your favorite rapper
Better than they ever could at saying my shit
So I rep my shit, much better than your favorite rapper
Simpson when you hear the name get low
And maybe live to tell the story the day after
Get 'em

[Hook]

Don't play with these mics, it's like playing with life
Through the day and the night all you hear is GET 'EM
We stay for the fight whether wrong or the right
Through the day and the night all you hear is GET 'EM
Don't play with these mics, it's like playing with life
Through the day and the night all you hear is GET 'EM
We stay for the fight whether wrong or the right
Through the day and the night all you hear is...

[Verse 2: The Audible Doctor]

Reporting live, from behind the boards
I've been born to ride the beat bitch you born to die
Uh, at least it seems so
You just another waste of life
Claiming that you breaking mics with your weak show
This that bounce in your whip shit
The cops pull you over like who is that it's sickening
Put your chips in
And bet on the cat that's fed on these rats to get fatter than my diction
Slim chance the kids advanced beyond the norm
The stage I be on peon's be warned
Get pee'd on when he's on a song
Sorta scary how he mark his territory before he gon' perform
Uh, don't even try that
His raps designed to leave your whole crew lying flat exactly where the line's at
So next time you wanna cross just stop
Before you force your mans to go and have to call the cops like
Get 'Em

[Hook]

Don't play with these mics, it's like playing with life
Through the day and the night all you hear is GET 'EM
We stay for the fight whether wrong or the right
Through the day and the night all you hear is GET 'EM
Don't play with these mics, it's like playing with life
Through the day and the night all you hear is GET 'EM
We stay for the fight whether wrong or the right
Through the day and the night all you hear is GET 'EM
