Verse 1:
(Yah) Keep up, I puff reefer
Without it feeling like I'm gonna self destruct
Hangin' with the homies didn't help me much, not in hindsight
Cause all we did was get drunk and find a fight
Shine bright like Aurora Borealis
Light up the sky, my slice of pie
Is when I tell my testimony like I survived
It's not a war without us, it's a slaughter
Sh*t I got daughters, and they need a father
So I docked the hate I harbored
Anchor for the family moving smarter
And circulating love like true supporters
But I know some that wanna destroy us
I feel it's so dumb to f*ck with a warrior
So I got a gun and bucks for a lawyer
Got 'em on speed dial but tucking a Taurusâ€¦ Simpson

Hook 1:
I'm Runnin'
Runnin' through my mind
Runnin' through my rhymes on the run
Days of runnin' the streets ran it's course
Now I'm in my run down city holdin' funds, lovin' it

I'm Runnin'
Runnin' through my mind
Runnin' through my rhymes on the run
Days of runnin' the streets ran it's course
Now I'm in my run down city holdin' the gun, runnin' sh*t

Verse 2:
24/7, 365
We get live, set it off
I put a bullet in ya frame
Smiley face by your name and check it off
We let it off, so get low ten fold
No matter the zip code, in rip mode
Hot head till the clips cold
Act stupid, get dum dums
I flash like a young gun WIlliam H. Bonney
Had the habit when a record label wouldn't sign me
Now I got a deal and I'm still grimy, fa' real
It's no lame on me, same ole G
Foes get holes cause the name hold ki's
Weights so the snakes get a taste and OD
While I kick back with my favorite Oz
Burnin' through that flame OG

Hook 2:
I'm Runnin'
Runnin' through my mind
Runnin' through my rhymes on the run
Days of runnin' the streets ran it's course
Now I'm in my run down city holdin' funds, lovin' it

I'm Runnin'
Runnin' through my mind
Runnin' through my rhymes on the run
Days of runnin' the streets ran it's course
Now I'm in my run down city holdin' the gun, runnin' sh*t
