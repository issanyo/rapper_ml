[Intro]
Woo
It's your man V-Styles
Yo
My man MoSS
Yo
Yeah, Simpson, yeah, yo
Ha, damn

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Don't take it personal, every verse is so versatile
Homie my punch line be turning them black and purple
Look, I get abusive when it come to this music
You sounded better muted me vs you is like
Humors vs muters you you spark I defuse it
You already knew this cause when I blow I’m a newget
Every track I show my ass like a nudist
Who this? The young nigga that's the talk of the town
Who doubting my sound? That’s like hoping the dog finna drown
That's impossible, sick and I should be locked in the hospital
This is a hostage note to anyone who had doubt that I was dope
Watching closely as they OD, promethazine and codeine
You mother fuckers down they feel like they on leave
I give them what they needed they feed us so I’m it
You'll want his good so I ain’t stopping until somebody bleeds
Shit I bit worm when I put y'all on notice
'Cause playing with money is like playing with my emotions

[Verse 2: Willie the Kid]
Integrity, I’m from the gritty
Where cops sport [?] T
Integral sweater I swear nobody better
The gray sweats where my gun kept
I keep composure, compulsive, I’m camoflauge
You can’t feel your pulse
I’m supposed to push foreign cars, support the cause
My comma sweet as karma
Varsity jacket like Kevin Arnold in my wonder years
You're still wondering bling check with the flow
I filled numbers in I been in a mountain filled shit
You and your feeling my nigga 5 four appeals
I beat the case and then broadcast it like Kacy kase them
Champagne  by the case Balenciagas lace them
Bitches I never chase them they understand my story
Blue diamond morning glory ghetto glamorous
Shot glasses half a glance at this gun room Michigan
Cardia glasses bling canvases I  paint a vivid picture

[Verse 3: Guilty Simpson]
I’m a bomb detonated, yo my flows explode
You like an empty six shooter with no time to reload
I flick your light punk I know how to fight
If you don’t know you can kiss it good night
I’m a magnet to those chicks come around watch them stick
With little brother up on my end yeah they feeling it
See hip hop and weed see we form a collinist
Stay away from fake gangster fake ain’t running shit
My energy is untamed after this then we bring the pain
Swag niggers your words are stupid dumb
All my sleep weary yea I get loud
Fight for my beliefs always stand proud
See the ring you will be kissing if you don’t
You will be missing in the trunk of a catti
Yea I know you be pissing
You should have swallowed your pride
You should have listened
Your time it haven't risen

[Verse 4: V-Styles]
I get up every morning knowing there is another eye to even out
I reach my destination there is no time in sleeping now
Just when niggers think it was safe to be garbage artiste
They started becoming targets and now they really departed
I’m here now and this is my inauguration I’m finally in office
And I ain’t letting up off of one wanting to be bosses
The ones that usually talk like they are the hardest or the softest
You just wait until you see their face dripping like Leo faucets
I am from the same city as J dilla a real killers behind me
From south west detroit to H Pilla so don’t disrespect will
Be tolerated back off or get glamorated gold squawk consolidated
Yes I’m a beast on so many levels with the soul of a rebel
And a God flow I’ll never give my soul to the devil
A mars you know exactly what to do with knee kill
V williams John Conor spitting the sickest of flu
They emotional when the cat is awake

[Verse 5: Big Gov]
And rats happily play back in the day we stay in the area
Cruise the avenues mentality of wounded animals survival mode
I dropped your body like a domino no acting when in drama mode
The flow is no comical nah I’m walking pneumonia
The target is stone kill I flow and I’m so to supreme
And I know team come parted at the scenes
I got ties that won’t slack they vest up
That's how you get them dressed up  press what
We don't respect your rules we keep slipping in the vest
And wet your dos you fall in this box standing back
When I go from man to man maniac
I’m emotional
