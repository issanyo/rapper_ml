[(Prozack Turner) & Guilty Simpson]
(Uh) Simpson in the house
Legionnaires, legionnaires
(I got this)

[Verse 1 : Prozack Turner]
Turn up the temperature, don’t kill the messenger
Burn down your senator’s house, watch the emperor
I made mistakes in life, but none permanent
These fucking bullies in my face like a nervous twitch
I ain’t afraid to die, but I prefer to live
I drink black beer, I keep the purple in
These dirty pigs, they merciless, they murder kids
They exterminate with hate just like the Germans did

[Guilty Simpson]

They racially profiling, media paints us as violent
Commute the outcries to silence
They got it down to a science (word)
And the city kids are Guinea pigs
Yeah they did it big ‘til they get their crib
Everybody’s going for a winner bid
Sad because the plan was to get them rich
And the pigs mad, cause they didn’t get a split

[Hook : Guilty Simpson]

We don’t want no problems b, get your names in the obituary column shi
We don’t want no problems b, get your names in the obituary column shi
We don’t want no problems b, get your names in the obituary column shi

[Verse 2 : Prozack Turner]
Good cops, unicorns and four-leaf clovers
They don’t exist like Jehovah or Moses
There ain’t no good cop they don’t ever speak up
They beat you up and leave you in the gutter leaking blood
Face down on your stomach with your hands cuffed
Execution, not an accident of bad luck
All they serve in a crime against humanity
Dirty cops get away with murder like McAffee
Commitin’ crimes, other cops turn a blind eye
They don’t ever set the men straight like a line draw
Love to kick ass, love to show boat
Before GoPros and folks posting photos
Popos loco, put you in a chokehold
Put you in the back of a squad car with broke bones
Concussions stitches and ice packs
Psychopath got a badge and he don’t like blacks

[Hook : Guilty Simpson]
We don’t want no problems b, get your names in the obituary columns shi
We don’t want no problems b, get your names in the obituary columns shi
We don’t want no problems b, get your names in the obituary columns shi
We don’t want no problems b, get your names in the obituary columns shi

[Verse 3 : Guilty Simpson]
Fuck the P-O-P-O, zero respect given ‘til they held responsible for all they transgressions
They don’t even try to hide it
They rather take nice dicks to you and your sidekicks
I don’t trust ’em when I see ’em
They got a complex ‘cause they playing God witcha freedom
I don’t even call when I need them
‘Cause they don’t give a damn about the fam, shit
They rather beat ‘em, and put it on cam
Then take the stand with blood on his hands
Lyin’ with a straight face, went from some out-of-date plates
To a man turned late grape
It’s all too familiar, question them they’ll kill you
It’s hate unfiltered
America gave us scrapes, we found a way, we made raps
And now they scared of us

[Hook : Guilty Simpson]
We don’t want no problems b, get your names in the obituary columns shi
We don’t want no problems b, get your names in the obituary columns shi
We don’t want no problems b, get your names in the obituary columns shi
We don’t want no problems b, get your names in the obituary columns shi
