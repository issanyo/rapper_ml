[Verse 1: hasHBrown]
Ancestors disappointed black folks anointed
And the self hatred turns global
Countries built off the work we did in they soil
Now we disgrace our humbled ‘great greats’
With material spoils as the white man drills for oil
From kings to rappers, doctors to trappers
Lawyers to actors, moon-walking like Michael Jackson
Blacks love to move backwards
Thinking ‘rich’ but not ‘wealth’
Smoke and drink everything benign health
Slaves paid the cost so we can walk around like the boss
White tees and chains, same thing we took a loss
Knowledge is power but we would rather floss
Strength in numbers but we hate whoever makes it to the top
Crabs in the bucket of chicken like fuck it
And if we loved ‘us’, we’d do better for ‘us’
Support is forced love, black on black slugs
Meet your brother with a mean mug but not a hug

[Sample hook]
“You don’t love me now, and you’ll never love me again
I can still hear you saying, You will never break the chain
Never break the chain”



[Verse 2:Guilty Simpson]

They got us scramblin’ for crumbs in the slums
Where murderers bust guns, I wasn’t blessed with a trust fund
So we trust none, from the same city
When cold cats die in the summer sun (Detroit)
They play the corner like a bump and run
I’m where the politicians never come
Street mayors campaign while reign
Get’s the moet toasting over priced champagne
I’m feelin’ so vexed, tension is thick
With one mention of rich, it’s like they programmed
Hit me a lick or get me a brick later get the enemy hit
Like this a new dope man, I’m in a strange place
Gangs of different hues but I’m still confused they have the same face
Killin’ themselves inner city hell with sales
Getting’ cats in cells

[Sample hook]
“You don’t love me now, and you’ll never love me again
I can still hear you saying, You will never break the chain
Never break the chain”

[Verse 3:hasHBrown]
As the youth suffers from broke homes Baby daddy’s baby mothers
The family structure in destruction
Young brothers not using rubbers giving birth to youngin’s
Enslaved with no hopes to ‘break the chain’
Music videos engraved in they brains
They actually believe what we saying, while education isn’t obtained
Nor maintained, drink the kool-aid , smoke the kush
Like we’re hittin the same strain, we should urge progress
In a government suppressed by economic depression
No wonder people stressin’ survival day to day
Is a test we ain’t ready for, like when the levees broke
Response time was joke I ain’t proud to see my folks sellin’ dope
Strung out on coke, we once was royalty
Every day above ground should be symbol of hope
Break the chain I can’t cope, I can’t cope

[Sample hook]
“You don’t love me now, and you’ll never love me again
I can still hear you saying, You will never break the chain
Never break the chain”
