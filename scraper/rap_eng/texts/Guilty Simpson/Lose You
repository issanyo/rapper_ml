Lose you, oh, oh, oh, baby, oho lose you
Never, never, never, never should I lose you
I dont want to lose you
Great days, the sun peaks from behind the clouds
A ray of light telling me to slay a mike
I put it down like Im laying pipe
I was built for contact, with a hit mans contract
We dont con act, we drink cognac
This banjy class, with my hands glass and turn sand to glass
We dont deal in deception, we share truth through reflection
Look close, you see your fear you chose
While I swing fist at your souls windows
Im a rebel roman, night life of a melatonin
Cursed by the devils omen, now what you used to
Stand by, cause I dont wanna lose you
Lose you, oh, oh, oh, baby, oho lose you

I dont want to lose you
North pole, I write with the right
And when Im done, you get left, on sight
Ignoring I have a hard life, its band aids on a shark bite
I can get you murked with a card swipe
You won't make the edits, I got you on debit
Im the type that double back and ask who said it
Make you known or you all get it
Land of the hard headed
They spark guns, the only rule is there are none
This ways to the lord come, when you hear sirens, cease violence
Next stop is hood stardom
They watch you round here, cause its obvious, you not from around here
You not what they used to
Stand back I dont wanna lose you
Lose you, oh, oh, oh, baby, oho lose you
Never, never, never, never should I lose you
I dont want to lose you
