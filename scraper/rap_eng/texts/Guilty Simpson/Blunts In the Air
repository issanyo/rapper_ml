[Intro]
If my mother knew I was in show business now
She would worry herself just sick
She thinks I’m in Philadelphia selling dope

[Verse 1 - Guilty Simpson]
Blunts in the air
We don’t watch what we’re wearing
Blunts in the air we don’t
Blunts in the air we don’t
Blunts in the air
Smoke when we wanna
Live without a care
Cuz we go where we wanna
Rolling everywhere
We roll marijuana
Holding everywhere
We hold marijuana
Me and the wife smoked out in the sauna
Stress eatin' me like I dove with piranhas
Detour on the road to the sauna
Only son to a young black mama
Black cloud over my head of bad karma
Won’t stop till the bank account got commas
Yellow belly stinks like they guts got jaundice
I tell them all no comment
Kill them with success was a promise

[Chorus]
And I’m gonna succeed on achieve on
And keep giving the street cats a theme song
That’s just how the best rolls
Let us see your fucking dress code
Blunts in the air
We don’t watch what we wear (sound young)

[Verse 2 - Cysion]
Put it in the air then pass it here
Don’t talk my ear off I’m trying to get my head clear
A fifth of Smirnoff we’re putting the bitch in a beer
Green thumbs and my palms been itching for ten years
Until I get what’s coming to me
I accept the present tense and hell is it’s familiar
For hard on the boulevard but never a tear
I might shed one once we check a million
We keep it true you keep it real
Anybody can be touched but the spiritual you fear
Get familiar with my familiar
We live in the backwoods of Vegas with God’s assist
I just wish I would get to the Sear's tower
I was eye to eye with God
We kicked it for hours
Cuz hold on
He’s holding on the floor
Blunts in the air
How much higher can we go

Blunts in the air
We don’t watch what we wear (sound young)

[Verse 3 - Guilty Simpson]
Love for my peoples the real ones
Bustlers for my peoples pulse it up
Puffing drugs with my people
Hold up it’s only blood with my people
Growing up I had trouble moving legal
Fast forward now it’s double when I see you
Cash tours
No more struggles trying to pay my vehicle
Yes lord your man’s threading the needle all aboard
Bandwagon I’ve been rapping
Now they recognize cuz they see me working harder than them other guys
Otherwise, they probably wouldn’t care
So I play they ass like they ain’t even there yeah

[Chorus]
And I’m gonna succeed on achieve on
And keep giving the street cats a theme song
That’s just how the best rolls
Let us see your fucking dress code
Move!
