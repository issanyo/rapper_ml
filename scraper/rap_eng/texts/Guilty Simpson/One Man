[Intro: Guilty Simpson (+ Sample)]
Yo
Mo'fucka
(One man)
I don't need a big mob of mothafuckas, I'm (one man)
Y'all can't fuck with us
Dice game
Yeah
(One man)
Yeah, (One man)
Yo, okay

[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
This might be the last time
It might be the last rhyme
They might blast nines
They might hit me
They might get me
I might have that with me
I might get them with that fifty
They might frisk me
I might be clean
I might not be
Yeah that's iffy
'Cuz I might'a heard you drop
Someone called the cops
So that fifty
I might'a had's history
Might need whiskey
I might need Henny
I'm longer in the tooth
But I'm deadly as any
I'm mighty
Yeah, I heard you rappers don't like me
But, I bet a grand won't fight me
Yeah, I might black out, pull a Mac out
Clap out, Swiss cheese your lil' trap house flat out
Yeah, these rappers get too much hype
So I lash out and strike, with superhuman might

[Hook: Guilty Simpson (+ Sample)]
I'm (one man), yeah, I don't need a squad
Ask around, they say "He's a problem"
Just (one man) with the heart of ten
Bring 'em all, I'll spark 'em in, I'm
Just (one man) at a time
I'm checkin' your whole squad for gettin' out of line mothafucka
I'm (one man), that's me
And all I need to make 'em bleed and suffer

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
I gave Ode To The Ghetto, Stray Bullets
OJ, Random Axe and The Mission
Fuck that
Show me where the money at
All I care about is the hundred stacks
Fuck that
Yeah, a lot of y'all fake
So stay out my face
I don't trust, so I treat 'em all like snakes
I don't duck and tiptoe around the place
The foes buck, and turn you to a pile of steaks
Why I relate, similar backgrounds
You don't back down
You lay that Mac down
And milk cash cows
My whole file's at stake
I turn nothin' to a pile of papes
Somethin' for you fakes
Eyes full of hate
With a smile on your face
Claimin' that you helped the name, shut the fuck up
I'm self-contained, mothafucka

[Hook]

[Outro: Guilty Simpson]
That's that realness
