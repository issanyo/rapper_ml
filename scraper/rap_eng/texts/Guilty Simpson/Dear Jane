Dear Jane, we need to call the queens
Cause every time you come around I wanna hear
And when I can't have you is like a world fix
But you, I can't fuck with your accountant, productive bitch
Wow! Promiscuous queen, down for anything!
Gotta see you in my dreams
But everybody calls trying to get you on the team
And you claim, but still, I can't blame you cause
You keep changing, get better with time
One session, you're clouding my mind, I can't think straight
I think we need breaks!
Logo for two, when I land in the city, I'm looking for you
I make phone calls sure enough you're coming through

I quit! I quit! I quit!
I quit, yeah, it's over
You're giving me cold shoulder
Cause. here when I'm sober
You make pebbles out of bogus
I quit, yeah, we're through!
I rode solo, it's no me and you
And I know exactly what you gonna do
Find another taker, it's nothing new!
I should have say end up a victim
I'm hooked, but I gotta get you out of my system!
I vowed I won't sweat you
You know the... who want oppression
I admit, she makes me feel better
So that's why a lot of gold getters go get her
Miss Marry, you got a strong hold on me, and that's scary
I quit! I quit! I quit!
Everything, everything, everything
