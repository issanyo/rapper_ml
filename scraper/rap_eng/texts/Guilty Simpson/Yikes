[Intro]
What, what! Y'all scared, OK!

[Verse 1]
We got shows reserved
I speak with a force like spoke word
While I'm chokin' herb
The heavy black skillet
Cook up beef until I stack like Illage
Mike. You don't wanna test my sales
I'm on a rampage, when you act chill I deal
Snakes send text threats to my cell
Fuck 'em, I reply back L-O-L
I give blunt c-sections, twist green
Get drunk all night and act sixteen
Livin' like there's no tomorrow
Happy I no longer have to owe and borrow
It's bizarre though, cats act funny
When a brotha get a minute piece of rap money
If that lil' check got dudes upset
You gonna be real sick when I do my set
Mah'fuckas

[Hook]
Y'all scared
Be aware (Yikes!)
The Boogieman's her
Y'all scarred(Yikes!)

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, alright
I'll make your side bleed
I'll get you hurt
I move with more jerks than a five-speed
Rollin, pockets bulgin'
Cops roll blocks can't stop the chosen (Nah)
Bars stay hot but the rocks are frozen (Yep)
Cats hate me for the spot I'm holdin', Fuck 'em
They wanna put holes in the top cat
And pop big shit till they get popped at
This is NOT rap. It's warnin'
Green-card wack emcees who talk foreign
And leave bars, never cross paths with us
The chain is out but the mag is tucked
Dirty hoes wanna take baths with us
Let me cum in her throat then drop the soap
These punchlines are not for jokes
I puff that green shit, Rasta smoke
And y'all scared
