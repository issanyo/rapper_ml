Yah
Get ready
Madlib laced it
Hot for the summer
Straight from the basement
Bang it, turn it up loud 'til you feel it
Flagrent, play it for the broad you chill with
Guilty
Let 'em know now that I'm coming
Raised in a dungeon, blazing the function
Stone's Throw gave me the push that I needed
Now I stay weeded
Chumps stay seated
We stay heated
Strapped for the gunplay
Fire (?) church
But I don't preach on a Sunday
Nope
I hand off styles like a run play
Dope
Quarterback straight to the super
Bowl
Lay kingpins out with the Ruger
Roll in the alley
Mack these airhead hoes in the valley
Pimpin' hard
Guard dog for those that's in my yard
Retreat or you get sent to die
Baseball hats might ditch or dive
Stare down cats I'm meant to rob
Voice of the vandals, rep for the have-nots
Scavengers show me that cash spot
Shake down, give me that dough and we out
Now y'all rap cats know we about that paper
Stone's Throw
Guilty Simpson motherfuckers
Madlib
