(sound of kids playing)
Yo
That fly bitch city life

It's all good (x2)
Yo

[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
Nightlife, bright lights
The city is alive, put it in drive
And bend the corners
Ears burning, they talking on us, niggas and flies
Mind's at peace
Still see the beauty in the hideous streets of true lies
Jaded view
But never let the block consume me to the point where I couldn't make a major move
We got too much stacked up
To get the oppressors back up
So instead, I'm pushing ahead
On to the next phase
I'm all packed up
Behind the wheel the will
I use to spit the real to real
And now I owe the deal the deal
Cause he knew skill for skill
Forreal foreal, these rappers couldn't match up
I used to say

[Hook x2]
(It's like life dealt me the wrong hand) [x2]
I used to say
(It's like life dealt me the wrong hand) [x2]
But look at me now

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
Yeah, I'm weaving through the fast lane
Feel the night air almost fresh as my Nike Airs
Inhale and exhale with deep breath
I could live my whole life here, yeah
I'm living out my luggage
I truly love it, I'm buzzing before my face hits the public
I'm stuck in my ways and not budging
I live my whole life hustling (hustling)
And today is no different
I'm drifting, in my own world getting lifted
Slow drag, smoke the whole bag
In my lap a loaded .44 Mag
And I hate to use it but I will
The savages they run loose for dollar bills
So I got smart and got steel
For those scoping the pad
I used to say

[Hook x2]
(It's like life dealt me the wrong hand) [x2]
I used to say
(It's like life dealt me the wrong hand) [x2]
But look at me now

Yeah
Real shit
