[Intro]
Yeah
Clowns are scary man
They show up, you run
Dice Game man
Yo
Yoo
Detroit
Ye-uh
Okay

[Verse 1]
When I spark a heat, fools jump over walls
Like park-our
I spit darker
From a place where ya couldn't see ya hand in front of ya face (Detroit)
I'm tryna tell ya mans he runnin in place
I move and success is somethin to taste
And failure tastes shitty
I tend to my nine like eight-fifty
Your outcome ain't pretty
I know I gotta go but there's plenty to take with me
The cards ain't fair
No matter the hand
I'll always keep a pair
All I have is those
And the words I chose to Share
Before it's lights out upstairs
Doin the art in heaven with our father
Until then
The on point author
Sword got sharper
What?
I vow to never hustle backwards
Don't ask me if I heard another rapper
Fuck em' all

(Detroit)
(Get it)

[Verse 2]
Yo
Set a date
My faction fractions
You'll get one four-fifth
Against your seven and seven-eights sized fitted
Gulity, I did it (yeah)
My crew stronger than the 300
We do a million in 5 minutes
Second to none my size with it
I get it like I never had it
I'm a ghetto hazard
Whatevers hot
I'ma level past it
Concrete words in my Epitablet
Stoned speech
I roam streets
Where the strangers don't speak
And hold heat
I got connects from NY to Long Beach
They'll react and put a patch on a slow leak
Detroit
My attitude is no gratitude
Backwards, your gorillas are banana food (yeah)
Unload clips, scatter crews on the avenues
It's not MC's fuckin with my attributes

Yeah

Brand New

The Two Zero One Two
