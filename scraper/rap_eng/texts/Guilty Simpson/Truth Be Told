[Intro: Guilty Simpson & Sample]
[Sample]
Oh baby it's been so...
[Guilty Simpson]
Yeah
[Sample]
Long...
[Guilty Simpson]
True
A lotta rappers be lyin', man
Scared to face the reality of truth
Yeah, it's true
Check me, check me, yo

[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
I didn't have the drive
To put in time
To keep hoop dreams alive
I was busy with the women
Thinkin' I was livin'
All the while slippin'
Losin' stride, uh
I used to hustle, baggin' up weed
But wasn't smart enough to separate my wants from needs
I was smokin' with the crew for fun
All the while losin' funds
Burnin' all my tree
I tried to be a thug
Fightin' with mothafuckas and tearin' up the club
I don't know what it was
I needed that direction
To deal with my aggression
Instead of pullin' weapons
Squeezin' slugs
Yeah I was broke
Rarely had dope
We had to ante up smoke
Sayin' what I wrote with hope
I told myself, "You want change, that's cool
Remember change starts with you"

[Hook: Guilty Simpson & Sample] x2
It's true...
It's true
Yeah, it's true
It's true

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
I didn't have the discipline to stick with it
To be a football star, experimentin' with the bottle
Ignorin' positive role models
Plus my homeboy had a car, shit
Yeah we was ghostin'
Visitin' chicks, skippin' school
At the time, I thought it was cool
Shit, I had an older woman, but didn't know nothin'
She had another man, I was just a fool, fuck it
I tried college
Mama said "Son, you gotta do better"
Kicked out first semester
Beefin' with the locals over stuff
That I didn't give a fuck about
What they did, so we bucked it out
Too much pride
To let somebody's bullshit ride
So I would happily shoot the five
Yeah, I needed change but I had to tell myself
"You want change, you start with you"

[Hook] x2

[Outro: Guilty Simpson]
It's true
That's that realness
Dice Game
It's true
