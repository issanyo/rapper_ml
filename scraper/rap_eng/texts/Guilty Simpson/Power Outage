[Verse:]
Yeah,  i'm heading for the pink pair a dice
I kick off my pair a nikes and she sucks like a parasite
Brown skin tone big body amazing she don't even babble on my cell phone
Hell froze i guess cause she let me in you use to act funny with her friends
Playing hard to the sex oops i mean hard to get
She thought id hit it and be in the wind
She thought i would be like the other men
But on the contrary i stayed a stand up  guy getting laid
Some say i got it cause i'm paid no
I said i got it cause i know them anyways power outage
They just turn off the lights so we better call it a night c'mon
Learned the curves by heart i love it when the thighs part
I'm in face first to kiss the place i miss to take away the hurt
Told her heart no perp it took a  lot more than work
Cat and mouse but within a few days we christening half the house
Going at it till we passing out yeah i'll sleep in it
Forty-five minutes the least in it
We get it like two rabbits ummm exploring some familiar places where she pouring from
I can feel her warming up pering from the vibration bare body going down to my hibernation
I got some fire waiting i smoke good sips something i then i put her on wood
I shut it down at night it's power outage through the whole hood it's power outage through the whole hood
They just turn off the lights so we better call it a night c'mon
She is coming i'm going i'm coming she's going
Then at the same time we take time
Then i eat it and beat i guess i heard it through the grapevine
Say she wants to facetime  gave us grounds to play when i'm gone many miles away
We exchange how's you days engage in small talk then i told her take it all off
Till it's a power outage so we better call it a night just shut off the lights
So we better call it a night So we better call it a night night So we better call it a night night
