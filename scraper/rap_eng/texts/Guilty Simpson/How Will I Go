[Intro: Guilty Simpson]
Question
You ever think about how you gonna go, man?
What your fate is?
How you gonna go out?
I do
I think about it quite often
Deep in my mind
I wonder

[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
How will I go? Will I know?
Will I feel pain? Will the steel bang?
Be a John Doe? Will they know my real name?
Or will the people know me? Will it be my homie?
Will I go on some beef? Will I go in my sleep?
Broad day in the streets? They call the people on me
Watching while the white sheet's put on me
That's a cold stage. Maybe old age
Or a foe from the old days
But I'm a changed man, that was my old ways
Will I have a chance to say goodbye?
Or will it be so quick, you shouldn't blink your eye?
I'm living life, but I'm sure to die
I'm being honest, we're all promised
Doomed to have your day, you can't stop it
Can't stop it
No, can't stop it

[Hook: (Sample) + Guilty Simpson]
"I wonder if I died" - Notorious B.I.G. 'Suicidal Thoughts'
How will I go?
"I wonder if I died"
How will I go?

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
I think about it, some say I'm paranoid
But it's an issue that I can't avoid
Will I go at the hands of an unknown man?
Or quick flash, like a Polaroid
Or maybe Alzheimer's, it took my grandmama
Forgetting everything she once honored, I'm being honest
I hope before He takes my life, I get a chance to make it right
I need answers, hopefully I fight like Mom
When she beat the breast cancer trying to say goodnight
Will I get to reach my goals?
Or will it be so quick that I won't even know?
I'm living, but I'm sure to go
I'm being honest, we're all promised
Sure to have your day, you can't stop it
Can't stop it, no, can't stop it

[Hook]

[Outro: Guilty Simpson]
Mo'fuckas think I'm crazy to even be thinking about that, right?
I think everybody does
I wonder
