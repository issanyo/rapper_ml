Yo

[Verse 1]
I blow a blunt, eat good, and blow another blunt
I'm dumb high, I don't even know the fucking month
But I do know, a lot of cats talk that shit
But won't shoot though (stop it)
You brought your gun, I brought two though
Both of them hitting your 2-door
Just for being wack and pseudo
And I don't practice Judo
But chop shit, when the ack stops, you'll know
I pop your crew, bro, my new 4 has no clue
But soon to find out what a blast gon' do
We take cash flow too
Go in your pockets (run it) there's kush bags on you (come on)
And the kicks beneath my calves so new
He, who seen more, has more, so true
I'm worldwide, who's siding with
So many days on the plane, I could fly the bitch
I'm in the clouds, you in the hood, it's that plain
And when I land, my plan is to slap lames

[Hook]
We gon' kill 'em (yes)
We gon' kill 'em (yes)
We gon' kill 'em (yes)
We gon' kill 'em (yes)
We gon' kill 'em (yes)
We gon' kill 'em (yes)
We gon' kill 'em (yes)
We gon' kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em

[Verse 2]
I did the mathematics, my foes are back at it
So, I keep an automatic and my passport tatted
Stay on the move, like, rip off an icepick shootin'
I live my whole life doing trife shit
Mama did her best, we had food, had the rest
But still I hit the bar and drank booze and a vest
Paranoid, plotting on a plan to rule the game
I much rather move the crowds than move the 'caine

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo, I push a pen with ease and it's a breeze
To make commodes out of these weak MC's
It's nothin', you boys bluffin', you ain't holdin'
45 horse for the whores, stay rolled and
On, I keep it so hood wit' em (hood wit' em)
My peeps'll tell you there's no good in 'em (no good in 'em)
But why apologize, my enemies pop 9's
So I hustled on some bread and went ahead and got mine
I'll turn your household into rubble
And your body parts resemble a jigsaw puzzle (Blat!)
Put it together when we break shit up
With black Beretta's, M-16's, Mac's or better

[Hook]
