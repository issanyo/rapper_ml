[Verse 1: Swifty McVay]
From Detroit to Madagascar
International platinum plaques are hanging all over my glass wall
We done burned a lot of killers, we lighter fluid spitters
Pay homage to J Dilla. I thank the Tribe for gettin' him
Motor City niggas with mob ties created a rapper like Big Proof, the realest nigga that died
Got Elzhi, my Hip Hop Shop alumni
Got Royce da 5'9" and Paradime, salute to that!
Slum Village and Phat Kat
Kuniva will backslap a rapper and have him askin' for his ass back
Eminem had mastered his craft, made a pact and he came back
Now Dirty Dozen spazzin' on the masses
We grabbed the industry by the Adam's apple
I'm after the capital, savin' the rap game is what I have to do
Hazardous. Lyrically and physically, yeah I'm the shit
I got your rap style in a Heimlich, bitch!

[Hook: Swifty McVay and Guilty Simpson]
You're welcome!
We responsible for stoppin' you from hoppin' in hospitals
You better (show us some gratitude) nigga!
You're welcome!
You incompetent, so now you wanna holla at my crew and I'm wonderin' (What's with the attitude?)
You're welcome!
You aggravated the game was resuscitated and we saved it, damn!
(Show some appreciation!)
Greatness in the makin'. We're the ones you should be thankin' (Simpson) Stop hatin'
You're welcome!

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
They told me I would never be shit
But through a song, I'd forever be this, now sing along
Days off with my heater on, I'm not the one to try to sneak up on
Wave the white flag, I'm never stag, the Desi blasts
Bring you punches for the heavy bag, but I hit back
I diss packs and watch 'em cry on impact
Right before they gettin' their shit snatched
I never changed. Tell you nothin' niggas I'm everything
I peddle slang through the ghetto range
And beyond that, my contact even hits home, where it's calm at
Far from the echoes of combat
Where the pigs circle your cars at and attack turn to hearts black
So I'm thankful for the art of rap
Through the music, they're a part of that

[Hook: Swifty McVay and Guilty Simpson]
You're welcome!
We responsible for stoppin' you from hoppin' in hospitals
You better (show us some gratitude) nigga!
You're welcome!
You incompetent, so now you wanna holla at my crew and I'm wonderin' (What's with the attitude?)
You're welcome!
You aggravated the game was resuscitated and we saved it, damn!
(Show some appreciation!)
Greatness in the makin'. We're the ones you should be thankin'
Stop hatin'
You're welcome!

[Verse 3: Swifty McVay]
Pay homage
If you're shit ain't polished, you gettin' attack by this brutally honest, cold, lyrical tyrant
Balancin' on a tree branch with one foot meditatin' don't wanna be bothered
A scholar of hip hop before the dollar
As it multiplied, I became a monster, writin' constant
Freestlyin' at After Hours, and guzzlin' scotch while all the people watchin', now the spirit of lyricism devours it
Now I stand on top of a tower watchin' these rappers like the city of Gotham with no cape
The assignment is to drop in these rappers' studio booths with a bomb to threaten them all to step they game up or they gone
Or you could get lyrically beat the fuck up like anime
The hell with your resume or your music, I don't let it play
I used to smash their cassette tapes back in the day, and then I stepped in the booth to slay
