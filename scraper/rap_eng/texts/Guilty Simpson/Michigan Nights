[Verse 1]
I smoke california kush all day I stay high
I make timeless music so I can't die
I'll live on through this song I mix bomb
Ass marijuana in a blunt and take a hit strong
And cough zoning off I'm in the clouds
Rockin crowds knowin' mama gotta be proud
Cause I used to be foul, used to rob for ends meat
Relieved a motherfucker then buried me 6 feet
With big heat, that was once a reality
When I didn't have a salary, but a savage mentality
Anybody runnin' with us had to be similar
Gotta be sinister when you guard your perimeter
Keep ya eyes peeled holdin the 9 steel
Cause motherfuckers will kill you to get a sidedeal
And that's how some play, it's a brand new day
When you're not in the fam' you're in the way, HEY...

[Hook] 2x:
I come from the streets
Michigan nights I snuggled with heat
Starvin' artist I hustled for beats
And when I fell I still got back on my feet

2nd Verse:
One phone call with make 'em cock the ruegers
Right hand push the pen like prosecutors
Lock shit down we'll cool your hot manuevers
Dudes get popped and dropped to rot in sewers
Ya rat feed, a black seed, black hearted
Clap artists, murderin' a track pompous
I'm better than you, I'm obnoxious even in my subconscience
We throw cash about
And right jab your mouth when your spazzin' out
Allow me to shed some light
I'm like that cat you never liked but was scared to fight
Broads top rate us, don't debate us
We holdin' paper and rollin' vegas
Smokin', headin' to a show in vegas
And anywhere in between with dough to pay us

[Hook] 2x

3rd Verse:
I'm a riot, you'll have to kill me to keep me quiet
Smokin' in the hyatt with the blunt on autopilot
Yes I have the money but I still will never buy it
Walkin' through the party with a rueger by my privates
Fly shit, I get wild
Run up on your crowd none is fuckin' with the style
And brothers really think they're fuckin' up my hustle how?
In a short time I'mma have a couple hundred thou
Wow, guilty's on a come up, he gettin' it
You know a brother killin' it I'm readin with illiterates
So I have an advantage, I paint such a beautiful canvass
Some can't understand it
Look a little closer and notice my pain
And maybe you can understand the thoughts that's goin' through my brain
And how I chose the name and reign, and flame the booth
R.I.P. DILLA and BIG PROOF

[Hook] 4x
