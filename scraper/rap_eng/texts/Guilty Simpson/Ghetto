[Chorus]
Ghetto of the mind [x6]

[Verse 1]
Check yo can I have your attention
Travel through the mind of Simpson
Running with gangsters and pimp friends
Everybody’s on a time limit
Moving fast with a side gimmick
So improvise and ride with it
Fam had a gun and he died with it
Barrel still cold
Thirty years old with his brain shot over what he owed
Some say over what he told
Some say over what he sold
Whatever still left to froze cold like the winter weather
Steal shows in the hood we don’t stick together
Killer's mask up like we’ll stick whoever
Wish I could say they do it to live better
But really they’re rocking with the clippers
Then turn and give it to a stripper
Seems silly but try telling that to a B Millie

[Chorus]
