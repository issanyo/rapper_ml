[Intro]
We've been doing a lot of talking, lot of thinking. (and)
We figure we better turn back. (turn back, is that what you figure is that what you want?)
We're hungry, we're sick we figure if we don't do it now we're gonna die out here

[Chorus] Uncommon Nasa
These long roads they always lead back home
To people that we care about is right there
I told you that I would be right back
Told you that I'd be right back
Now peep the compass

[Verse 1] Guilty Simpson
Way out here way beyond ever imagined
Feet firm holding my ground
Parts unknown, booked to rock microphones
Roaming the town
Temporary staying, sleep late, had to go to get a day in
Produce the CD's, the weed plates, we need papes
Wake and baking, paper chasing, in each state
Listen, bitter cold wind
Got us feeling like old men, harsh conditions
Zoned in, task at hand, master plan apply that
Save your wisecracks and laughter fam
Merch, money tallied up, packed the van
Touring, exploring,  no sleep till the morning
Self medicating, Cognac pouring, until my keys turn doors in
At my residence, I keep giving excellence and set precedents
Until I'm back home settled in

[Chorus] Uncommon Nasa
These long roads they always lead back home
To people that we care about is right there
I told you that I would be right back
Told you that I'd be right back
Now peep the compass

[Verse 2] Shortrock
New York!
The most minute marker on the edge of that building may be your only guide home. (Lost in the moment)
That could only be owned if your sure to guard against it being stolen. (The moment)
Take it back! With you in your pocket because your shirt has light to it, slide into it (So watch your back)
Keep the hoodie behind your ears to peep your peripherals
They may not be into you but trust no individual
Decisions do have value, at a time where not much is worth it. (Never worthless)
The return home is a fortuitous fortune
This winding road has turns bent all facing direction
Intersections are an infection, hurt focus
My shirts noticed, drenched from all the sweat from all the walking
But I'm back at my kitchen table counting money and talking, stalking but not pacing
Pacing patient, my household is disciplined in the art of waiting
Everywhere is all of me but never greater than my lady
Now never question why you pay me!

[Chorus] Uncommon Nasa
These long roads they always lead back home
To people that we care about is right there
I told you that I would be right back
Told you that I'd be right back
Now peep the compass

No matter where I at
I'm just grateful I'm capable of holding this mic
[Instrumental Scratching]
