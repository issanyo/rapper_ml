Verse 1: Guilty Simpson
Forever I'm G
You criticize but whatever I'm me
Take it or leave it, or take it I'll leave you
It's my life fam, can't get a redo
Rappers are see through, I know your intentions
Casket fit them, with no exceptions
Goin' for Simpson, nothin' can hold me
Nothin' can fold me, threadin' the needle
And so we, fed the eagles
[?] the people against the odds
Build a squad, can't believe who
Rose triumphant without the [?]
Without assistance, close the distance
And in that instance, I knew my job (what)
Stay persistent, don't give in
And all my real friends are [?]

Hook 1:
Better learn to program
Where the hearts are cold
They empathize with no man
Better know your roll
Better know your stroll
Livin' like it's no fam
Where the talk is old
All they know is motion
West side don't play
East side cats gettin' that pay
Southwest and east ya' get sprayed
It's nothin' we do it everyday
West side don't play
East side cats gettin' that pay
Southwest and east ya' get sprayed
It's nothin' we do it everyday

Verse 2: Guilty Simpson
Forever I'm G
You criticize but whatever I'm me
I blow trees, drink whisky
Run with gangster cats, than I emcee
I don't expect everybody to understand
Brotherly band fam don't bite the hand
The neighborhood blocks are getting' hotter than Sahara sand
With killers in caravans never spare a man

Hook 2:
Better learn to program
Where the hearts are cold
They empathize with no man
Better know your roll
Better know your stroll
Livin' like it's no fam
Where the talk is old
All they know is motion
West side don't play
East side cats gettin' that pay
Southwest and east ya' get sprayed
It's nothin' we do it everyday
West side don't play
East side cats gettin' that pay
Southwest and east ya' get sprayed
It's nothin' we do it everyday

Verse 3: AG (of DITC)
I reached a point where my mind is so free
Top ten, the top five, the top three
Nowadays I'm just tryin' to top me
Play on a level that most will never see
And every time I turn around my ni**a's dyin'
So I like walkin' in the rain so you can't see my cryin'
You think I'm walkin' but I'm flyin'
Immune to the sirens, in tune with the Mayans
I'm used to the noise, awkward when it's silent (shhh)
So I find myself talkin' when it's quiet
Misunderstood most the time
It's weird, but I'm clear when the words rhyme
Can't describe what I feel, the glory is all mine
Sorta like the first time, I climax in my rap, the same thing
In junior high, wasn't fly, so I made wings
Now my name rings, say I claim king
