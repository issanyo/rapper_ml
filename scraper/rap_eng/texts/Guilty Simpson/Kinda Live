(It's kinda live) The way you show how you feel
(It's kinda live) The way you wear jeans and heels
(It's kinda live) The way you smile when I'm home
(It's kinda live) The way you sound on my phone
(It's kinda live) The way you get mad and curse
(It's kinda live) The way you memorize my verse
(It's kinda live) The way you trust what I said
(It's kinda live) The way you work that in bed
(It's kinda live) The way you do what you do
Hold up girl, let me talk to you

[Verse 1]
You, me, us, just think
I smoke trees, do drink
I touch you and you wink
But hold up 'cause you ain't hearing me, girl
Well, say, let's leave here and go chill
Then, you nod yes, it's so real
'Cause you felt me with no deal
But that's why I keep you in my world
'Cause you got me, it's no lie
And what we have won't die

And you let nature take course
And we strip down and got lost
In the moment because we could not hold it
Then, you told me of your past
And how he did you so bad
And your pain made me so mad
I wish that I could have met you sooner
But things work out in due time
And now I'm on your mind and
