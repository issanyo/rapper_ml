[Verse 1: Ras Kass]

Wash my hands in the sand, speak true gladiator
Happy cannibal and cunnylingus, I'm gladiator
Grab these rappers by their skinny jeans pockets
Put 'em in the mosh pit disney land cap prophet
Gothic, disaffect of those to the hard shit
Vocal for locals, to build these niggas hearts with
Protein, caffeine, steroids, dopamine
Heroine injecting, chocking on promethazine
Horse play, till the horse force you off like Chris Reeve
Neglected in seeds, neck not connected to your legs please
Believe me nigga, we never said it was easy
Got it off italic, house of Batiatus
Dominus, Oenomaus, Gannicus, Spartacus
Take money Fanimaius
Taking rap fans to Afghanistan like general Petraeus
Bet you my metaphors is more UFC than Bellator, I can skull fuck Skeletor
Like an apex predator
Got a grunty gap to knock off where your tummy at like relacore
I'm that fiend that's trapped under your celadore
Gladiator music hid out forever more
Hella form on the back of a Pachyderm
Every time a black is born as far as rap concern

[Hook]

Y'all bitches shouldn't touch that mic
Call Michael Vick pussy kill a dogfight
Put us in the ring homie don't bark or bite
Walk on all fours start a human dog fight

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]

Are you not entertained, the gladiators
Swinging weapons at your fabricators
Till nothing remains, civilized savage brute the chain
And ran wow, your clown feeling the empower face first
I wage hurt till I hit pay dirt
Or make decay hit day shirt, day work
But not like me a power forward
Nothing hold the block like G I'm flake rim
I write pavement these big streets
And produce hits on producers for weak beats
Speech heat, you feel it from the cheap seats
I'm hotter than a wacky keen bitch
Get your soul real put the impact and make a rapper do a whole flip
I roll spliffs till we burn up to the whole sip
That low shit till they turn up on the road clip
Finish
8 MC's I'm a straight up menace
Warm beef, get your cake up hit it
Got heat you should wake up with it
I'm that serious, pussy time for a period
Period

[Hook: x2]

Y'all bitches shouldn't touch that mic
Call Michael Vick pussy kill a dogfight
Put us in the ring homie don't bark or bite
Walk on all fours start a human dog fight
