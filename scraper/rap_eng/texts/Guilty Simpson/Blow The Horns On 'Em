[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
Yeah
It ain't shit to nail the verse
I might be the best ever
But I'd rather let you tell me first
I was trained for the title
My music speaks volumes
Hear me?
My clothes reek of Henny
Loner, I don't speak to many
Its over
Your time is up, keep your pennies
Haters want to eat my food
And you mother fuckers wonder why I keep my tool
Think about it
The hood is a firing range
Young kids high in the brain
Admiring gangs
Inside they pick a side
And ride on a nigga
Break down bud
Put la in the swisher
Blaze that kush
Get high high with your sister
When the pot's consumed, cop a room
Get her drunk, make love to her jaw
Guilty Simpson nigga, your new borther-in-law

[Hook: Guilty Simpson]
Yeah
Blow the horns on 'em (horns on 'em)
We reign supreme
And let it storm on 'em (storm on 'em)
We leave no survivors
When we swarm on 'em (swarm on 'em)
Lock 'n load
And wage war on 'em (war on 'em)
Blow the horns on 'em (horns on 'em)
Blow the horns on 'em (horns on 'em)
Blow the horns on 'em (horns on 'em)
Blow the horns on 'em (horns on 'em)
Yeah, we blow the horns on 'em

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
I'm so hot I need a fan
And you so not you need a fan
Your beats so whack you need a band
Naw, in fact you need a hand
To clap for you
Or an open hand slap will do (bitch!)
I abuse you rap crews
You're no contest for the ruler
Cold as snow but much cooler
Old Man Winter with the temper to match it
Below zero flows, zip into your jacket
Play hero and get burnt like matchsticks
Spit that crack bitch so keep that whack shit
I'm in a league of my own
Bully of the block, you can breathe when I'm gone
Hoes gotta love it
Their boyfriends don't though
When I'm in town
She a no call no show
Guilty Simpson you know the name
She won't be back home until I'm on the plane

[Hook: Guilty Simpson]
Yeah
Blow the horns on 'em (horns on 'em)
We reign supreme
And let it storm on 'em (storm on 'em)
We leave no survivors
When we swarm on 'em (swarm on 'em)
Lock 'n load
And wage war on 'em (war on 'em)
Blow the horns on 'em (horns on 'em)
Blow the horns on 'em (horns on 'em)
Blow the horns on 'em (horns on 'em)
Blow the horns on 'em (horns on 'em)
Yeah, we blow the horns on 'em
