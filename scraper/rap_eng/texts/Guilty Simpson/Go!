[Verse One: Guilty Simpson]
Oh you hard now? I laugh at that
I must be on Punk'd, where Ashton at?
Step up in the party with a plastic gat
Glock that I carry for the grab and snatch
Shine like the gym, untied tims, bad bitch pulling on my limbs
Telling all her friends it's him! Feeling like a Don
Grab her by the hand and get a quickie in the john
We raise hell and make bail
And put illegal products on weight scales
Place a few phone calls and make sales
I pray to god my lifestyle escapes hell
Stoneface
Running my affairs at my own pace 'till my bankroll's straight
I want the mutherfucking icing and the whole cake
You just a crooked ass nigga trying to go straight

[Hook] x 2
Get your pistols (Go...Go)
Launch your missile (Go...Go)
Settle your issues (Go...Go)
I got a feeling somebody's gonna die tonight

[Verse Two: Guilty Simpson]
You want lyrics? Try these fam
You a joke like Black Man, White Man and Chinese Man
In fact you're more like them Knock-Knock shits
Your temp's 98, you're not that sick
I spit venom on your favorite denim
I burn like the slugs that I'm spraying up in 'em
That's how it is everyday in the Mitten
Lay my verse, lay down and lay in the kitten
My hunger's intense
I'm from the underground coming under your fence
Patting on your pockets nigga come with the rent, a forfeit
It's not for the weak in heart, call quits
But desert eagle got a beak that'll make you get a body leak
Who got a beef? Get ate by piranha teeth
Yeah the click's like that
Move in packs and move them packs

[Hook] x2
