[Verse 1: Montage One]

Well orchestrated word play complicated
Obligated from bar one to sixteen
Hooks with the deadliest catch the amphetamine
Dope rhymes like coke lines of ketamine
Beats cooked in the jungles of the Medall√≠n
With blood diamonds rap blinding better bling
Mac ten machine clapping everything
And GPS lyrical threats mapping everything
I got the game in the scope and the cross hairs
Wild grizzly punchline you park bears
Full mansion studios in dark lairs
Nigga we not fare murder rappers right there
And emancipate songs in a greater rate
I leave critics to talk like its Laker hate
Fly rap over heads I aviate
And bang beats to death like a skull from heavy weight...
