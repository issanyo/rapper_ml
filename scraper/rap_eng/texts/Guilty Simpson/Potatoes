[Chorus]
Like one sitting in a love seat
Life is lonely and incomplete
Like one sitting in a love seat
Life is lonely and incomplete

[Guilty Simpson]
Yeah, this rough rap’s a hub cat
In my entire, I pop off, with a better handle than hot sauce
I get them clipped like a mob boss, the rap villain
I get it cracking with a 5th of Henny black chillin
I get in action when I sprinkle in the back feeling
And get a match and light it up and make a rap killing
I’m back dealing, a daily dose of the dope that they crave the most
I’m that different
Something new I’m the vision you see when you coming through
I’m the obstacle you dream of running through
Can’t do it, you fuck up crews and toast booze
So I hold the 4, like a couch potato with a house full of yayo
Protect my dope at all cost
The price of your doubt is failure

[Chorus]
Like one sitting in a love seat
Life is lonely and incomplete
Like one sitting in a love seat
Life is lonely and incomplete

[Torae]
My rap’s rap wrap is the fuck up and set off rage
In this whole rap is fire, y’all just lit off astrays
Spit bodies, spit homy, should I spit on stage
This the realest shit your iPod said all day
You said my name address me as one of the best
And if you said it sideways, you get one in your chest
I’m a homicidal nigga with verses spitting and writing and hearsing
You play my shit in reverse, you can hear who I worship
The god of the paws, be a new jacker veteran
Only my niggas is niggas that I embedded in
My late nights got the hype of David Letterman
While you guys still hide in the same closet they sexed you in
All I ever been is just what you get
They ask how I feel to big, I tell them question my dick
I’m the answer and the problem if the question is this
Who the nicest motherfucker to spit, it’s torae nigga

[Chorus]
Like one sitting in a love seat
Life is lonely and incomplete
Like one sitting in a love seat
Life is lonely and incomplete
