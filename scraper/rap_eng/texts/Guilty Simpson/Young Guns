[Intro]
There’s no motherfucking way, man
I’ve had it with that bullshit
Some niggas still won’t give you a pound after they see you, just stand up
Man, what the fuck is going out there, niggas be really losing their brains, man
Acting like there on that other shit
Detroit, Michigan, spittin’ flames around here, check it

[Verse I: Guilty Simpson]
This my crew be prepared to fight
You don’t want to be on my level ‘cause you’re scared of heights
I’m evil, don’t even ask me to spare your life,he other option is a chair for life
With wheels on it (nigga) rollout ‘fore I have you niggas leavin’ with a swole mouth
Still unsigned, you can call it a holdout, eatin’ getting drunk at your local Roadhouse
Not really concerned with these rappcats, doing our shit then split, nigga, that’s that
Be serious, so before you try to get all curious, and bump guns
Just remember you’re fucking with some young guns

[Interlude]
Standoff, motherfucker
Get your shit bucked
Causing all roughneck, guttered niggas
Smack the shit out of a bitch nigga type motherfucker
The fuck, nigga
Throw’em up, y’all, it’s real out here

[Verse II: Guilty Simpson]
Shit happens for a reason, I know that, true as a year has four seasons
Cold as the winter when I spray from your darkness and blast, too far, face down
Some of y’all niggas waste rounds, aiming in the air, “Who the fuck up there?”
Claim the street, gotta play for keeps, pitbull litter niggas what we were trained to be
Tossed in a circle, blood stained my teeth, out there they hurt you
Life spans is brief these days, so I keep the heat these days
And hold it when the green leaves blaze
Paranoid with apparent eyes, would you want to be crazed

[Verse III: J Dilla]
Oh, yeah, turn it up
This one is called
The way, (let’s go) the way
Move that g-string out the way
Move that g-string out the way
Move that g-string out the way, ay
