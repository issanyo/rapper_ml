{LEAVE ME ALONE}

[Intro: Guilty Simpson]

Yeah, Guilty Simpson sayin what up to The Audible Doctor
What's poppin, leave me alone man

[Hook: Audible Doctor]

Leave me alone, when you see me walking up the block
And you wanna say peace don't stop just
Leave me alone, when you see me chillin in the spot
And you wanna say what up just stop

[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]

Leave me alone
A blunt and a microphone and I'm straight
I treat the place like it's home
And relax and body tracks with second nature
With a flavor better than a life savor
The squad reacts with force
When a hater wanna play a rhyme sayer like dirt ain't me
For that I say R.I.P
A fatal mistake, the dope man owe money we take it in weight
Then we taking the block
Catch me at a random spot, overseas I don't travel on the land a lot
Blowing trees sprinkling green grams of pot
Low key paranoid duck camera shots
Never catch me with the stacks on E
My gun tatt MCs like Kat Von D
So we should all pray that I win
It's either this or picking up the heater once again

[Hook: Audible Doctor]

Leave me alone, when you see me walking up the block
And you wanna say peace don't stop just
Leave me alone, when you see me chillin in the spot
And you wanna say what up just stop
Leave me alone

[Verse 2: Audible Doctor]

Just move past him
Been dwelling in the city of mice and men
Where heads liable to leave your neck fractured
The olfaction be picking up the whole attraction
They say the flyest get on, I say the growth come after
I poem these heavy stones up in the dungeon
And represent that W like tungsten with no fronting
From the belly born unique to rock the function
And be out riding dolo like Shameek after bustin
The Ike Love of this rap land
Pimp the whole game a spiked glove for the backhand
Bitch you know the name
Flip a script without acting
They popping power pellets at your clik
Ghosting cats like they Pacman
So don't wonder why I don't come around
I'm in the lab building my foundation on solid ground
A doctor but I don't have any patients for all you clowns
If you see me in the street keep it brief give me a pound
And keep moving

[Hook: Audible Doctor]

Leave me alone, when you see me walking up the block
And you wanna say peace don't stop just
Leave me alone, when you see me chillin in the spot
And you wanna say what up just stop
Leave me alone

{COMPLICATION}

[Verse 1: Audible Doctor]

Yeah
Fuck the conversation, I was born with this in me so ain't nothing to overcome a little complication
Ain't afraid of confrontation, I'll body everything in my path and laugh cast the audible abomination
Fuck the bravado I'm liable to crush your system
When mixed with anger of strangers thinking he's stranger than fiction
Depicting pictures of him different cuz he spitting his diction
He missing the proper grammar but language meant to be drifting
Can you hear me now? church
Art thou pale for weariness of climbing heaven and grazing on the earth
Simpleton accepts the simple symbolism of this verse
And the complex got a complex to study every word, neither works
Assed out, time to pull the cash out and make it rain fun and games until you catch drought
Assed out, time to pull the cash out and make it rain fun and games until you catch drought
