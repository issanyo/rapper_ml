The following is a public service announcement from Guilty Simpson
This is a Public Service Announcement from Guilty Simpson

[Verse]
From the tough terrain that bust your brain on GP
Them coulda-been's keep paper towels and squeegees
See it every day in the D-E-T
Close enough to know it'll never be me
Fuck that- if I work I'm getting bucks back
Trust that, slam nigga, wasted
My liver noise probably sound like a grand river - damn, nigga
Sick smile like Mack Nickels
Crumble herb, never act brittle
You get smacked cripple
Your future darkens but you get good parking like that kiddo
That's the bright side, no MMA, you better fight [crime?]
Get you a cop while on a siren ride
Cause fucking with me - you fried from Saturday night specials
And Sundays with cyanide
That's a weekend
Your fool Guilty went over the deep end
Beef with me, you're never seen again
You're playing with the heat again
