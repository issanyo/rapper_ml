[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
They used to call us communists for fighting America
Now they call us terrorists to spread hysteria
Well let me just say this with out sounding redundant
Who the fuck really gained the most from blowin' up London
And who really made Bin Laden the man that he is
The CIA and Saudi Arabia did
But that's the past and the future is here
Iraq was a design so for some people the future is clear
A Christmas tree pyramid with the star as a eye
Like a satellite in orbit watching me from the sky
Every country wants a piece of the America pie
But that means you have to co-sign Americas lies
So you can criticize human rights and Cuba and China
But not in Israel the Philippines or places you find them
That are allies of the country y'all live in
Whose clothes are made by slave label women and children
Yeah I know at some point we're all part of that hypocrisy too
But I don't front like this democracy do
I don't pretend troops are peace keepers that don't murder
And they don't create colonies whose governments serve us
Movin' em with our economics like when we shed a tectonic
Plates in your vest are no good nigga the weapons are silent
Your war on terror evolve like strands of the chronic
From the weapons that's biologic to the propaganda topics
And its all for profit, stop it
