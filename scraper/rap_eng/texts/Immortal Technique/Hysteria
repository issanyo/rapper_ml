They used to call us communists for fighting America
Now they call us terrorists to spread hysteria
Let me just say this, without sounding redundant
Who the fuck really gains the most from blowing up london
And who really made bin laden the man he is
The CIA and saudi arabia did
But that's the past and the future is here
Iraq was a design so for some people the future is clear
A Christmas tree pyramid with a star as an eye
Like the satellite in orbit watching me from the sky
Every country wants a piece of the American pie
But that means you have to co-sign America's lies
So you can criticize human rights in Cuba and China
But not in Israel or the Philippines and places you find them
That are allies of the country I live in
Whose clothes are made by slave labor, women and children
Yeah, I know stupid we're all part of that hypocrisy too
But I don't front like it's democracy dude
I don't pretend troops are peacekeepers who don't murder
And they don't create colonies whose governments serve us
Moving away our economics like we share a tectonic
Plates in your vest are no good, the weapons are sonic
The war on terror evolves like strains of the chronic
From the biologic to the propaganda topics
But remember, the system can never stop when it's been set into motion
Like volcanic eruptions on the floor of the ocean
My purpose is to burst to the surface
Immersed in the smoldering lava from verses
Surrounded by murder mamis, not bitches that's worthless
I cut chicken heads off, like hexes and curses
Weapons I purchased makes homeland security nervous
I run pockets of purses like subway searches
I'm robbing masonic temples disguised as churches
I'm busy, so i'll leave that one for you to interpret
You serpents are merchants of military industry murder
The beef is heating up, like the mad cow in your burger
Fathom the call of cattle cannibalism
Factory farms are like a fucking animal prison
A microcosm of adam smith's capitalism
That's america's real religion, given as the mark of the beast to the christians
The destruction of Babylon motherfucker thats my mission
