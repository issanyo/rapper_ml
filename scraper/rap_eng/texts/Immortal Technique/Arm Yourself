[Hook 1: DV Alias Khrist]
This game is cold, I told my broad I won't be coming home
I lost my job, I lost my mind, lost everything I own
The city got me fucked up.. yo these pigs got me fucked up..
Music on the radio is fucked up, I hop in the truck and only want to feel the pain

[Hook 2: Chino XL]
Chino XL, and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Immortal Technique and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Psycho Realm and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Real lyricists and fuck everybody else!
All my street soldiers STAND UP!
Arm yourselves!

[Verse 1: Sick Jacken]
What the fuck happened to rap? I need to put my lyrical clip in
It’s on homie, gun clapping is back
These pop acts make me wanna pop gats
This whole shit is fucked up coz radio just broadcast trash
Surround the wack, blast my semi-auto tracks
Launching deadly hollow caps and taking out the whack
And many follow that, swallow that...
I’ll burn you vocal like a bottle Jack
You thought you had the streets coz I was gone
Well we just got ‘em back! Homie you can check my team
It’s super ugly when you get us all together, Sick, Tech & Chi
This reign of terror won't end with me
I spawned a little psycho coz my baby momma kept that seed
Now I'mma take a little trip to these radio stations
Grab them punk ass DJs, wave guns in their faces
If they don’t play my shit then it’s “Welcome to Hell”
Coz all we want is Immortal Tech, Chino & the Psycho Realm!

[Hook 1]

[Hook 3: Chino XL]
Immortal Technique and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Psycho Realm and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Chino XL and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Real lyricists and fuck everybody else!
All my street soldiers STAND UP!
Arm yourselves!

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
Chino’s ill, slap off your cosmetics
I arm myself like a veteran putting on prosthetics
My barbaric genetics bring pain
The only Revolution that you’ve ever seen is Prince’s group in Purple Rain
Deranged monster is sponsored
You get shit on and pissed on like Tila Tequila at a Juggalos concert
Ain’t tryna be glamorous, hammers we snap like cameras
I’m fuckin’ intense like teenage camp councilors
Spit blood through your stereo, there we go, time for your burial
Fag niggas, after you rhyme say no hetero (hahaha)
My murderous sentences, no secrets where my weapons is
Locked in the closet next to pop rappers' sexual preferences
Amber alert, your girl's mouth ran away with my kids
If you’re sick then I should be diagnosed with three days to live
You slip I kidnap you and give you a mean death
Beat you with your Blackberry till there's barely a screen left
Jack and Tech my dawgs like Andrés in the Philippines
My mistress is villainy, rape and pillage ‘em lyrically
My symphony's sinfully biblically loved by killers
Who gives a fuck who’s the greatest rapper alive as-long as Chino’s the illest!

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
Fuck a silent Revolution, soldier, I'm on the warpath
I’ll throw my commandments down on your platinum calf
You'll get your face slashed like a Rikers Island reminder
Behind ya snipers will find ya whether you run to China
Or try to crawl the fuck back in your mother's vagina, (bitch!)
And I don't need a fuckin' co-signer (hahaha)
To murder gassed up underground niggas like coal miners
Bring it back paying homage to the old timers
I was bred as a carnivore, bred as a cannibal
Flow sicker than pictures of people fuckin' animals
Like a car crash ripped in half neck to the crotch
Muthafuckas scared to stare but they secretly watch
Niggas wanna play Shaytan? Well let's get it on
I fire missiles like the fuckin' shit that hit the Pentagon
You not strong enough to do a song with me I'm the truth
Like Tina Turner motherfucker, you'll get raped in a booth!
