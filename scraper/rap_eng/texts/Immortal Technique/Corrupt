Immortal Technique's verse:

You know when the cops are comin' to get ya
Tryna' light you up quicker than Nikola Tesla
Applying choke-holds like a professional wrestler
And videotaping the protesters and hecklers
I spit on you at the Diallo march, remember me?
When New York City rose up as one entity
(Ahhh) you hiding in helicopters and tanks
And ICX towers in the streets like the West Bank
Thanks for the reality check, so far...
You been exposed as political Praetorian Guards
So you can drive drunk, kill people and only do a year
But soon dissidence to the system start to disappear
And all sorts of governments crumble, so stay humble
Violent lottery for the power ball that you fumbled
And I don't hate you all but I'm sceptical of most of you
Because the death of Posse Committals stands close to you
