[Verse 1: Fatz Da Assassin]
Napalm, fire storm, industry melt down
Got em’ runnin’ around seekin' salvation underground
Decadence and negligence paralyzed the economic infrastructure, weaker than it ever been
The consequence, now anarchy rules
Jacob playin’ hot potatoes, droppin’ his jewels
Watchin' these fools abandon truth when they rhyme
They hang around Flav’s neck, they all big-time
Mainstream’s encrypted with a virus
Hijacked like an oil tanker by Somali pirates
Adorn the battle armor of a verbal assassin
Settin' off napalm, with murderous passion
Genocidal fall-out, martyrs, casualties
Krylon tapestries, ashes and memories
This is the frontline, this is the dead zone
Barely alive or in a box is how you head home

[Hook: Immortal Technique]
This is napalm, Greek fire, white phosphorous
Justified genocide, judgements days politics
Preach life and liberty but give the world the opposite
So I play Jesus casting devils out the populace
We are all casualties of war
We are all casualties of war
We are all casualties of war
We are all casualties of war

[Verse 2: Goodtime Slim]
This be a Rebel Army call: “Send assault in!”
Slice you like I’m Sultan, scorch you like molten
Lava, spit it to the heavens like a geyser
Bitch niggas strip from my violence like the Gaza
Lethal transcriber, calm voice and wordplay
Build a cult following, call me Slimothy McVeigh
Thoughts get separated, lyrical land mine, beats get detonated
Anybody feelin' liberated get obliterated
Lastin' oppressions from a maniacal depression
The war zone, each lost limb should be a lesson learned
Make you incessantly burn from the fuckin’ napalm
You a slacker, see the Rebel Armz my faculty
Underground barracks be the last stand for cavalries
Screws closed, get oxidized like glucose and calories
Stuck in the cell by my 16 bars
Change the P to a C, 'cause you a casualty of war

[Hook: Immortal Technique]
This is napalm, Greek fire, white phosphorous
Justified genocide, judgements days politics
Preach life and liberty but give the world the opposite
So I play Jesus casting devils out the populace
We are all casualties of war
We are all casualties of war
We are all casualties of war
We are all casualties of war

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]]
I never tried to be Jay Z or Big Poppa
I’m underground like them dead children buried in Gaza
I see through the eyes of a generation yet to be born
I come from an alternate future where freedom is gone
I refuse to pledge allegiance, like Jehovah’s Witnesses
Take your shine and feed off that shit, like photosynthesis
You niggas don’t understand the world that I come from, but you'll understand the casualty of war when you become one
Your mother raped by soldiers, gave birth to a brother
Now you understand what it’s like
To hate and love a motherfucker
The chemical structure of food and water corrupted
Children abducted for organ-harvesting production
The function of epidemic sprays that are man-made
Are that genetic upgrades are only given to slaves
So I’m on a crusade, with rocket-propelled grenades
To change history with the Rebel Army brigade, nigga
