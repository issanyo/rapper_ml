Fuck how you feel about me
Say what you will about me
But lets see how you feel
When the walls come tumblin down
When the walls come tumblin doowwn yeaahhh
When the walls come tumblin down down down
When the walls come tumblin doowwn yeaahhh
When the walls come tumblin down

[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]
They say that racism in america's over
Well tell that to the pigs when they pullin me over
No eye contact just the gun out the holster
Plantation overseers, prisons filling their quota
They call us niggas they call us thugs
Say we all good for nothing and we all sell drugs
They call for blood they callin the squadrant
But I am Oscar Grant, I am Trayvon Martin

Invisible mad faces at the bottom of the well
We been through hell
Still seen ‘em turn to life in Henrietta Lacks’ cells
These Uncle Tom’s be corrupting the biz
And it’s word to the wire under Al Sharpton’s wig
Pigs still shoot us in the back though
Regardless of them nigga tweets from Gwyneth Paltrow
How low do we go to fit in
Killing ourselves, even bleaching our skin
Racism biz, satyed right on track
And none of it changed just because the President’s Black
Fuck that!~

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
Gotta condition your brain when you get in there
To make you believe that the walls always been there
Preservere in the game without getting your flesh torn
Gotta get to a square that’s not on the chess board
Invisible walls, classism and privilege
Even taller than apartheid walls you live with
Government’s a business clouded in smoke
And when you broke, only real choice  Pepsi and Coke
Motherfuckers build a wall for every reason alive
But then change the reason when they get you inside
They built a wall to try to keep terrorists out
And it becomes symbolic what terrorism’s about
Built a great wall for barbarian neighbors
And it’s trampled by terrorists a thousand years later
Now they built a wall to keep immigrants out
But wanna pick and choose the immigrants they talking about (bitch)
Jericho’s wall came tumbling downward
They hear the car, turns rock and metal to powder
Rebellious minds, I need you to think louder
Before they police every thought they encounter
Jericho’s walls came tumbling downward
When empires fall, you see who laid the groundwork
You think the spark of revolution’s an outburst
I guess before Jericho, we come to your house first
