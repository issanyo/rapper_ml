[Poison Pen talking]
Yo, this Poison Pen
The album, its called The Money Shot

[Immortal Technique talking]
Most of yall muthafuckaz
Yall ‘Don’t even know what your rights are
You think your rights the opposite of your left (ahaha)
We have these rights, guaranteed to us
(Poison Pen – You ain't taking my burner nigga)
And once they get revoked...
(you gotta cut my finger off nigga)
Bueno es hora de revolución muthafucka!

[Immortal Technique]
I keep a burner stashed
Loaded up with hollow tips
Cause’ politics can turn your city into the Gaza Strip
Military industry, justify sales like a drug dealer lyrically
Fucked up physically
But halving two sides doesn’t imply symmetry
Cause’ Philly to Filastin, our children are fricassee
Times up, like the Celestine prophecy
My paper is folded now, no more chances to copy me
Them ghetto philosophies will get yourself killed
If I don’t sell them the product “somebody else will”
America, like it or not, I represent you
You teach me and sell me the weapons to use against you
My stray hands used to sack cities for New York bitch
Now I'm Alaric, Gaiseric, four seventy six
Smart muthafuckaz from the hood learn history
Stupid niggas never learn shit and die religiously!

[Hook: Poison Pen and Immortal Technique]
Rebel Armz Locked and Loaded
The only law once the government is corroded
(2nd Amendment)
My life might be intense
But my rights will not be infringed
(2nd Amendment)
Is it propaganda for weapon companies
Or necessity in the country we see
(2nd Amendment)
Yeah, know this ___________
Not for whilin’ just for checks and balance
(2nd Amendment)

[Poison Pen]
I walk around town with the pound strapped down on my side
No frontin’ just in case I gotta smoke somethin’
Sa gloves just in case I gotta choke somethin’
Hawk out just in case I gotta poke somethin’
Dirty dirty just in case I gotta go huntin’
Open case in the city, I don’t know nothin’
Random macs (no) you wanna play my circle?
My pedigree is made to _____ you
But we’ll hurt you!

[Immortal Technique]
Reverse AIDS commercial
Death equals silence
Anarchist, El Violen, reactionary violent
Cursed music out of a red violin
Only republicans I fuck with live in Northern Ireland
Warrior chief liken the beast from the east
Drive-by in the drive-thru, we share beef with police
One for the Bronx, for Queens, for them Oakland streets
Fuckin’ empty the clip in em’ for my peoples in Greece
Nigga!

[Hook]

[Poison Pen]
Mr Obama, congratulations on that win
Don't take away my right to hold my llama
I’m a citizen, like that dude in that militia
No felonies, unlike that dude in that militia
Antebellum statues paved the way for me
It’s registered with the state dawg
Its day of the siege
Police won't protect me, the beast won't protect me
I stand back to back with the gats with Technique
We called "Rebel Armz" for a reason
I defend hoods with heaterz
Like Condoleeza’s pops
Pack off, Pop off, on them evil cops
Torch yours, I torch mine
That's when the bleeding stop
Tryna’ confiscate mine
So you can catch and drive my grey piece
I’m Haiti in the seventy nineties (Sak Pasé)
Control em’, border
The government sponsored slaughter
We supreme
Revolution, how this land was founded

[Hook]

[Immortal Technique talking]
Yeah, Immortal Technique, Poison Pen
Stronghold / Rebel Armz
Hahaha
You gotta know your rights pussy
So that, when they break the law on you
You know how to break the law on them
Hahaaha...
