[Verse 1: Pumpkinhead]
Praise to the most high for blessin’ me with a seed
Now I gotta make it to the top with Speed, like Keanu Reeves
And when I bleed, I feed a million children indeed
With the knowledge and the strength that they need
Fuck the military!  Man, beg my pardon
The only thing my dad got from them was Agent Orange
Cocksuckers experimented on they own soldiers
I'd rather be in a coma than help fill in they quota
Give me a bulldozer, and before the world is over
I'll find Bush and his daddy and run both they asses over
The Bushes are trigger happy and wanna be in a war
Two people that like raising the taxes and killin’ the poor
I say I put the sword to they jaw
Let it off 'til they jaw fall on the floor, and Colin Powell callin’ the morgue
You call him a hero but I call him a whore
Gettin’ pimped by the system that wanna see the end of us all

[Hook: Pumpkinhead] (x2)
It goes: one grenade, two grenade, three grenade, four
Pull the pin, let it go—it'll be the death of us all
I'll be a motherfuckin’ martyr before a soldier at war
Fuck the law, we gon' settle the score

[Verse 2: Pumpkinhead]
One grenade, two grenade, three grenade, four
Pull the pin, let it go—it'll be the end of us all
I'll be a motherfuckin’ martyr before a soldier at war
Fightin’ my brothers and sisters overseas for your laws
You stick your nose in everybody country business when yours
Is the most corrupt nation, illumination blinding us all
You don't think they already got UFOs in store?
With technology to travel lightspeed past ours?
I guarantee these lizard reptilian figures
Hidin’ under human flesh under they breath callin’ us niggas
I pull the motherfuckin’ trigger, explode your liver for fun
And I won't stop 'til daddy and junior's kissin’ my gun
Slugs pop from a short distance—listen, you're done
Your existence short-lived, now you live on the sun
Burnin’ for eternity, your skin lift off your bones
Now your skin is black like mine with a crispier tone

[Hook: Pumpkinhead] (x2)
It goes: one grenade, two grenade, three grenade, four
Pull the pin, let it go—it'll be the death of us all
I'll be a motherfuckin’ martyr before a soldier at war
Fuck the law, we gon' settle the score

[Outro: Immortal Technique]
Yeah.  You see, my black and latino people, there are some truths that we have to face.  And there are some lies we have to uncover.  And there are some fake muh'fuckers out there talkin’.  And they talkin’ for us, but they not talkin’ to us.  And they not talkin’ about us.  They just speakin’, as if it was from our perspective
