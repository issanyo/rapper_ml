Yo Akir, Talk to ‘em

I watch the old heads
Reminisce about old bread
They wish they would’ve made
Money squandered that they could’ve saved
At an early age
Dropped out of school; an early grave
If they would’ve finished they could’ve got paid a better wage
While their friends chase life faster
And made they way to the lonely grave of the sedaku get plastered
Sees the laughter the blain the lack of perseverance as slackers
On the same of the slave masters they hate
And no they never took the time to build their craft up
Looked for the answers from past us while their life passed them
High off a pipe or ice blastin’
To get ‘em back to a time when they thrived off of bright passion
I fight like every day is my last one
I never take my freedom for granted; like the nigga that’s up in them handcuffs
I methodically kill shit like Manson
I try to get my money like they holdin’ Grandmas for ransom

[Hook]

What’s mine will come in time
I’m tired of thinkin’ things will turn out fine
So be patient
What’s mine will come in time
Don’t rush the vision; Things will turn out fine
Be patient

You see I started off jumpin’ the guns
Stumblin’ tons of mistakes
But these are the brakes
Humble was never fun
Though taught me to shake it off and re-evaluate
My motto was: it’s better to take I’ll fuck around and wait
I guess its fate
None of that dumb hate locks me in gates
Some say: “Life is a one way and you should try to pace”
I should’ve listened to Uncle Mike
Cuz he was really right
He tried to tip me to what grown man life would be like
Or Grandfather when he bothered to buy me that bike
I saw the kids move and I just want to do it I’m like
Without fear
And if I lose and fall
It’s nothing at all
He found it amusing that’s where my dumb ass hit up that wall
My pride was hurt but I was more pissed off
It’s like an old story
What a repetitive theme
From toddler to teen
Student to MC
I knew where I wanted to be
I wanted to speed
There’s nothing you could tell me

[Hook]

What’s mine will come in time
I’m tired of waitin’; things will turn out fine
So be patient

[Immortal Technique]

If the music’s regarded when I’m dearly departed
My life wasn’t what I thought it would be when I started
We was broke as a family but when I think back then
I could determine that’s the wealthiest that I’ve ever been
Church flee market apparel, dressed like the cripple child from a Christmas carol
But nothing comparable to the avenues that are back in Peru
Picture a country where people’s dreams never come true
Even Spanish TV won’t let you see the squalor
White Jesus on the wall but they worship the mighty dollar
I became a cat burglar, thief, and a robber
Street pharmacist vicious rise to Connecticut holler’
The cops collared me for the way that I reacted violently
And the prison system made me a slave and a commodity
Buried underground like prehistoric pottery
My life fell apart like families after the lottery
But in the hole I wrote a prophecy; I would fulfill
And every year I grow stronger and triple my skill
And even though my cap will be pilled and I will be killed
At least it’s for the Revolution and not over krills
My willing testament tramples the mind of a pessimist
Take you back to the prequel before Genesis
Effortless demeanor like FEMA during Katrina
‘Cuz my flow cannot be locked up like the mind of a dreamer (Yeah)

What’s mine will come in time

I’m tired of wishin’ things will turn out fine
So be patient
What’s mine will come in time
Don’t rush the vision; Things will turn out fine
Be patient
For what’s mine will come in time
I’m tired of waitin’; things will turn out fine
So be patient
What’s mine will come in time
Don’t rush the vision; Things will turn out fine
Be patient
