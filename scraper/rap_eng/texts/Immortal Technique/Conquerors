[Speech: Dr. John Henrik Clarke]
Nearly all religions were brought to people
And imposed on people by conquerers
And used as the framework to control their mind
My main point here is that if you are a child of God
And God is a part of you, then in your imagination
God is supposed to look like you
And when you accept a picture of the deity assigned to you
By another people, you become the spiritual prisoner of that other people
