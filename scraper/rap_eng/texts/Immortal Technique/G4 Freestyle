I won't rhyme about puttin a hole in your in dome
I get Israeli on you I put a hole in your home...
Holdin a chrome rocket propelled grenade launcher
I get paid to murder motherfuckers like the Contras..."
Weapon scandal I handle The gamble of making examples
Hannibal Elephant trample mandible samples
Curve serving on you little bastard niggas
It’s not a movement if you don’t own your masters nigga
You asked me here to spit a feestyle but here's the difference
A freestyle is some shit that was never in existence
Like the shit im kicking now, the shit with the know how
The shit that Im proud e yo
Immortal Technique the last Mahican on the warpath kid
Should've gone to jail forever for the crimes that I did
But im chillin like a frigidaire, I never care
Immortal Technique the freesyle of the mental
Immortal Technique I don't recognize this instrumental
But I guess you made it up just a moment ago
Im rocking it slow or am I rocking it fast?
Immortal Technique I was never late for class
I just didn't show up, fuck it Immortal Technique Rolling tracks
Immortal Technique I said my name too many times
But thats what happens when you spittin freestyle rhymes
And you just say the first thing that comes to your head
Like I like some cheeseburger with a little nice bread
Fuck it I ryhme about whatever im kinda hungry
Immortal Technique My pockets full of money
And some of y'all ain't and if you mad at me than fuck you nigga
And I can still freestyle and that didn't rhyme it's just offensive
And it just get's relentless, Immortal Technique not repeditive but
Except when I say my name not a sedative
It gets you lived up it gets you crazy it gets you hyped
It gets you ready to fuck your girl tonight
That means im responsible for your baby being born
Im responsible for a lot of shit
You can call me a terrorist cuz I attack in response
Immortal Technique yeah I drop bombs, and thats what happens
Immortal Technique never been platinium, guess I said my name so many times
But thats so you can remember it, so many rhymes that I spit
And thats the way we market shit, it's ingrained in your mind
Like them commercials you hate Immortal Technique im still making this paid
And then
I now you gonna hate this shit when you play it back cuz your be like damn how
Many time he said his name on a track, fuck it a said again
Immortal Technique, fuck you, that's the end!
