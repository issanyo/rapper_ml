[MC Caness]
I stay a mile high like Denver
So I say, I better spit a chorus with a style I'll remember
So when you're spittin' it starts gettin' wild in the center
Rippin' it gifted like a Christian child in December
And gettin' it lifted like when I'm eatin' out blunt lips
You gettin' it twisted by speakin' 'bout dumb shit
Your young ship, I run shit from drum kicks to tongue flips
With Parallel Thought, it's much deeper than a cunt gets

[Wordsworth]
Choruses connect in my verses, raise the curtain
The crowd in unison has us connecting in person
Views so you know the titles of my songs vibe and sing along
What they ask for when you buy it in the stores
Without a hook you would OD from my bar supply
You need a break before your brain and your heart subsides
Give you a chance to turn it off or listen to the rest of it
Show you that I'm beyond and for y'all it's best to quit

[Karniege]
This is a great song stupid
Eight bar brutal when I cook you a hook that'll shake y'all noodle
Like hockey writers, smackin' a poodle
Put your hands up, that'll make 'em get cookoo
Straight jacket racket, kids unusual
Karniege swing buildings, "Yo where Brookey go?"
To another time zone, C-3PO
Funky like B.O., BB just ease yo

[Double AB]
These A&R's appall us, like "Nice verse but we want a chorus
Then you'll be larger than a dinosaur is."
So fuck a Brontosaurus, cause the shit I drop off the top enormous
Yo my shit is hot, get your fire insurance
They ask Double AB for catchy hooks
But all I rap about is Gangsta Bitches, that's the joint Apache took
So when they ask for hooks, this is what AB will do
Hook you up to feeding tubes, that's what you'll be eating through

[Interlude]
I'll tell you what kid. You'll never fuckin' be good enough. You'll never be good enough to sing in this fuckin' town, I'll tell you that. You'll never make Chorus Line. You ain't no Wonder Woman

[Tame One]
Trife I live it and give it all
With chickens for lickin' my balls and shaft, if not they haulin' ass
On blast cause even with no check
I gets low neck from chicks in projects with no sweat
Cause the heat's off, no threat
Here, here's my cell, you can yell at who you go get, tell 'em "get at me"
Let's be diplomatic, I'm [?]
Like Jim Jones, I've been grown
Since the only thing for me to fall back on is my ass
I'mma sing songs for cash on flask long as it last
Dead ass

[R.A. The Rugged Man]
Yo
Haters don't like us, we write this for 25 to lifers
In Rikkers and Harley Davidson riders and bikers
We Warriors, can you dig it like Cyrus? It's like a jungle sometimes
Lions and tigers want to ignite us and light us on fires
No cost, no platinum cards
Relaxing, back massage, ghetto ass rap stars
In the club flossin', I'm broke actin' large
Smooth secret garden, I'm the pale El DeBarge
Sho' yo' right

[C-Rayz Walz]
What you need to catch fish with
The Candyman's weapon of choice
Peter Pan's arch nemesis is this shit
Just don't let me connect one to your cheek
Cause if I do
You will tongue kiss your teeth for a week
Kareem Abu Jab y'all
I stay hittin'
Low dunks
But if the beats bangin', they'll listen
That's why my style is the science of jooks
I am Demetrius Mitchell
(Why?)
I am the hook

[Thirstin' Howl III)
The hook
With the line to follow
The real, the beaches define the model
Money, hoes, clothes still do them all
On the magazine cover of "Dude Was Poor"
Polo king
Oh yeah mayne
I'm the Goya bean
Still takin' all ya bling

[C-Rayz Walz]
That's why my style is the science of jooks
I am Demetrius Mitchell
I am the hook

[Klu Sheisty]
I am the hook, but that's just the half of me
I'm a walkin' weed spot you should ask for me
Got The Hook-Up like Master P, passin' trees
Guaranteed you'll be hooked from a blast of these
I'm a real dirty hook, stop actin' sweet
I hang dead cows up, don't ask for beef
I'm a real grimy hook to a nasty beat
I'm a real hot cook cause the rap's is heat

[C-Rayz]
Just don't let me direct one to your cheek
Cause if I connect
You'll tongue kiss your teeth for a week

[Sean Price]
Yo
Hook rap
Pirates, pot poets cook crack
You look wack
Hurricane game, sneakers on, fuck is wrong with ya?
Sean is a killer
Sean a gorilla
Ape in a tree
'Bout to scrape your date off some E
Back flippin', gats spittin'
Sell crack rappin' dude
Back smack a few rappers who rap with an attitude
Sixteen bars, bring in the hook
Sixteen scars, y'all niggas is shook
Who called police?

[Swave Sevah]
Ayo, fuck how many bars it take
I'mma keep spittin' rapid fire darts till the target break
I'm gon' be direct and get my point across in 8
Spit 16 out of this world if you lost in space
24 make you walk off with your chin in your chest
32 end your career, put your spirit to rest
This niggas a threat, just give me a track let it cook
I stop when I'm ready, I don't give a fuck about a hook

[Poison Pen]
Watch out for the hook, jeah
Eight bars, four bars, two bars
Most of y'all flakes is fubar
Niggas with no bars abuse 'em
Most of the rappers in Texas don't use 'em
Stupid
Right hook homie, bust up your shit
The wrong hook homie will bust up your wrist
Clutch up your fist
Don't fight with me
Get hit with so many hooks y'all should pay me ghost writing fees

[C-Rayz Walz]
What you need to catch fish with
The Candyman's weapon of choice
Peter Pan's arch nemesis is this shit
Just don't let me connect one to your cheek
Cause if I do
You'll tongue kiss your teeth for a week
Kareem Abu Jab y'all
I stay hittin'
Low dunks
But if the beats bangin', they'll listen
That's why my style is the science of jooks
I am Demetrius Mitchell
(Why)
I am the hook

[Thirstin Howl III]
Hook
Like prostitution
Pussy free everywhere is the top solution
New York slang, choose your gang
Still in all do ya thang
White bitches show me love before Jeezy knew what snow was
Hook
Longer than methadone clinic lines
Did it fine, didn't mind with pigeon primes

[C-Rayz Walz]
My style is the science of jooks
I am Demetrius Mitchell
I am the hook

[Immortal Technique]
Fuck a chorus
Straight cancer like Phillip Morris
Burning like magnesium phosphorus
Top of the food chain, tyrannosaurus
It's saber tooth, bloody truth
Ripped from under my tongue in the booth
Psychotic youth
Fucked in the mind
Monkey wrenching their own plans, stuck in they grind
A sign of the times
A forthright flooded with neo-nazis
And haunted by the souls of murdered Iraqis
No chorus can stop me
Motherfuck 'em

[Outro: Immortal Technique]
Hahaha. Fuck a chorus nigga. Stronghold. Immortal Technique. C-Rayz Walz. Uh. Like that. Hahahaha
