[Verse 1:]
You're not as cold as me, motherfucker stop pretending
I'll murder you in front of your crib like John Lennon
Rip the tendons out of your muscle to cut the tension
I'm beyond your comprehension like related subatomic particles in fifth dimensions
Suspension in your breathing is what I'm leaving until a legion
Of demons whisper the meaning of life in your ear
Right before they make your motherfucking life disappear
But just cause you hear the multi-syllabic grammatical
Don't compare me to rappers that are on sabbatical
Cause I never did business in little fucking Italy
I play checkers on triple-decker tour buses in Tripoli
The way that you typically bicker with me inexplicably
Is a mystery that pisses me off ridiculously
Because I'm lyrically beyond your level scientifically
Specifically spitting out the spic in me prolifically
I'm the majority of America futuristically
After I die, fuck my music, you'll feel me spiritually
Darker than Sicily ripping above the averages
You hold no weight, like bitches after miscarriages
And your label produces no kids like gay marriages
I'm disparaging every fake thug rapper in sight
That's why your faggot ass will never make it into the light
I'll crack your skull when I smash your face into the mic
And now you know what I'm like
I'll Suge Knight the industry, I feel like the spirit of Nat Turner got into me
You're infinitely hopeless, you sound like shit when you spit live
Like Jennifer Lopez, I'll massacre a rich rapper
And all his broke friends, and go to Club Cheetah
Rocking some blood-soaked Tims, party crashing, animal-fucking model bitches
Leaving their stick-figure anorexic pussy in stitches
My verbal blitzes have outshined your offence
You're watered down nonsense, and I'm two-hundred proof
Choking the local youth in this home-made vocal booth
You're a fucking incomponent killer like Rae Carruth
And I'm Technique, the rawest nigga ever produced
I spit nastier than regurgitating period juice
So burn your fucking rhyme book
Stay warm, and put it to good use
I'm about to drop like frozen airplane-shit through your roof
And I'm sick of fake hustlas telling lies to the youth
You never robbed Dominicans, and you couldn't sling rocks if you was Palestenian
You broke motherfucker, you cats don't burn rubber
You niggas can't even get a fucking cab like Danny Glover
You ain't hardcore, I'll smack the shit out of your mother
You wanna be gutter? I'll leave you laid out in the street
Signed yours truly, the motherfucking Immortal Technique

[Outro:]
Yeah, Immortal Technique
Yeah, cut this motherfucker's face off
