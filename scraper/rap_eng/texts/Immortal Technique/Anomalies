[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
Ayo, you're blind to the fact, cause you're a coward and a dreamer
A pussy like Nazis hiding in Argentina
Pop shit, I'll catch you quicker than a misdemeanor
And put you in a fucking box next to Selena
Cause I'm the meanest motherfucker you could ever imagine
Incarcerate the universe inside a single atom
But since the populous can't fathom space n' stars
I spit razor-blades that cover your face with scars
Killing you on the spot like you saw the face of God
Empty the clip in you and load 16 for your squad
Dying is easy, but living with Satan's gonna be hard
I spit revolutionary bars that'll touch ya'
Bolshevik status; murder you, like the King of Russia
And on your tombstone chisel "Fake motherfucker"
Cocksucker, I played you
Cause I'm the God, but I wouldn't send my son to save you
I gave you the pieces to reconstruct the world and the past
But all you could was ridicule the future and laugh
So Imma' split you in half, machine gun to your belly
And then I'll piss all over your little sister like R. Kelly
I got more connections than illegal selling microchips
To hunt you down after I destroy the mic when I spit
Immortal Technique bitch!
I'm a real lyricist
Other people just use Jay-Z as their ventriloquist
Now run and tell your boss, you mothafuckin' snitch

[Verse 2: D. Rymz]
Most cats can't remember me cause my brain shaking energy
Mentally hitting victims so hard they lose they memory
And generally, you'd rather go to hell than be my enemy
You're meant to be with a foot in the chest, there's the penalty
Divide then mutilate drum beats
Before I touch a MC in the cypher, I lubricate the tough piece
Spin against his Earth till' his reality's reversed
So when he spits his best verse, it comes out as his worse
So life begins in a hearse and ends it with birth
So everything that he hate, he loves until it hurts
My logic is sick
All you chumps gotta get sticked
Hot as the clip that was dipped up in the bottomless pit
With knowledge equipped
I thieve on the foolish
Reason I knew this
Jesus and Judas, Caesar and Brutus
David Goliath, I'm seizing Divine
You heathens are blind
Be warned, I storm like all four seasons combined
Carve your extremities like mob in the Genovese
Heat the part of the brain in charge of the memories
Dudes done forgot how we starved in the 70's
Sons continuing wars
Our fathers were enemies
In these dark spots the Don bomb like the Lebanese
The wicked trying to replace God with celebrities
You heard me
The wicked trying to replace God with celebrities

[Hook x2]
Too real
Too fake you trying to be
My powerful words something you ain't trying to see
A real lyricist, in depth, so honor me
I am what you not
I'm an anomaly
