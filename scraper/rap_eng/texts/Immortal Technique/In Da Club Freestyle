I know I look like Immortal Technique to you
But I created this genetic clone just to speak to you
Me and 279 are plantin' a bomb in the building
'Cause underground shows never got women and children
I'm serial-killin' every fake nigga alive
So most people tryin' to rap won't survive
Machine-gun everything around me like a panorama
And burn rubber with the ghost of Princess Diana
I'm like Santana: pullin' strings in the game
While slaves emulate their masters livin' the same
Forget the fame, I can't rest a second alone
I got homeland security tappin' my phone
But here's a warning to the government that creeps on me
I'm like a cum-stained mattress: don't sleep on me
I roll deep, with a fully loaded AK
Murder cowards in their sleep like the IRA
I represent Zone 4 Dawg, that's the best hood
You catch a shot while you sittin' in your whip
Like Tim Westwood
Whilin' out, you know how we doin' persuin'
And this is freestyle in the meanwhile
Other cats are spittin' a written bitten composition
You're crushed into submission
This is Harlem, you'll never rise to stardom, kid
I came down to London, and you know how we did
And this is off the dome, off of the brain, lyrically insane
And that's how I'm trippin', that's how I'm flippin'
Ayo, check it out, now I'm the illest Latino
I never had to buy an album back like Benzino
You know I'm sick with the flow, spittin' it slow
And yo, I had to go to the bathroom, I made a scramble
I lost 10 pounds, and I don't even gamble
So you know what's happenin'
When I'm rockin' it off of the brain, lyrically insane
Immortal Technique, sayin' you nice as me, dawg?
You straight tellin' lies
Me and you have never been even like Biggie Smalls' eyes
When will you realize Immortal Technique is iller?
The socialist guerrilla, stomp you like a stone pillar
Comin' through, representin' whoever
Cleverly, under the weather, yo, it's like that
The Latin assassin will make it happen
I'm about to go platinum, but when you see me up in the spot
Rockin' it hip-hop off the top of the knot
And yo, that's how it goes, that's how it flows
That's how it shows, ayo, it's 96.9
Ayo, I substract the same numbers from both sides
And that's 5-9, and that's fine, and I continue to climb
I continue to shine, I continue to climb
The voice of racism preachin' the gospel, ayo, that's devilish
A church in America called the prophet Muhammad a terrorist
Forgettin' God is not a religion, but a spiritual bond
And Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Qu'ran
They bombin' innocent people, tryin' to murder Saddam
When they gave him those chemical weapons
To go to war with Iran
This is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings
'Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a New Age Sally Hemmings
I break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish
The Judas I hang with, the guilt of betrayin' Christ
You murdered him, stole his religion, and painted him white
Translated in psychologically tainted philosophy
Conservative political right wing, ideology
Glued together sloppily, the blasphemy of a nation
I got my back to the wall, I'm facin' assassination
Guantanamo Bay, federal incarceration
How could this be, the land of the free, home of the brave?
Indigenous holocaust, and the home of the slaves
Corporate America dancin' offbeat to the rhythm
They really think this country never sponsored terrorism
Human rights violations, we continue the saga
El Savador and the contras in Nicaragua
And on top of that, they still wanna take me to prison
Just 'cause I won't trade humanity for patriotism
Ayo, I'm still buggin' out, I know you flipped the instrumental
Which is coincidental, I'm spittin' off the top of the mental
Ayo, this government is tappin' my phone
Like I told you before, I'm keepin' it raw
I smash your kids hands in a car door
And thats how it goes, you know there’s ill and there's crazy
Immortal Technique blazingly, amazing MC's
Yo, I'm hangin' out with the illest rappers alive
And yo, I strive to be better, I strive to survive
I strive to strap a live wire to the top of my brain
I make cuts on my dick with masochistic tactics
And then take a fat ish
While simultaneously stabbin' a pregnant fat bitch
On a vomit-covered mattress
While the featus uses my dick to practice gymnastics
Dancin' on it like a balance beam, doin' backflips
Ayo, I smack kids, and I compact them, ayo, I subtract them
And I'm keepin' this freestyle from the brain
I'm lyrically insane, let me explain
Ayo, let me give you the rap-up from 2003
People went to war and they tried to drag me and everyone else, and now we about to put Tony Blair back on the shelf
We're takin' it over, my word to Jehovah
I don't got a Range Rover, I be in the tube, I be at the […]
Spittin' on people's faces and whilin' out
Ayo, no doubt, I keep it complete, Immortal Technique
And I can even flip it in Spanish, make rappers vanish
{Proceeds to rap in Spanish}
Like, Immortal Technique, I be chillin', with my boy Clamento
Ayo, Ralph Dogg dot com, log on, so we can drop bombs
Yo, Bragging Rights to hook dot com
To Rock Steady, you're not ready
Won every battle in New York city
Your style is not pretty, kinda like Macy Gray
Ahaha, and my faith in God is kinda shitty
I'll put my hand on a Bible and tell Whoopi that she's pretty
And this is some mean stuff
That I'm spittin' off the top of the brain
Ayo, you know how I rock, 2-7-9
That means you catchin' eighteen shots
And that's how it goes, and that's how it flows
And I'm out of here, I'm out with your ho
I'm with your masters and the cash in the Jetta
Sinceramente Technique, end of the letter
