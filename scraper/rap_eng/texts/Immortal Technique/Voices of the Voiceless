[Lowkey]
From West End to the West Bank
I write righteous rhymes with my right and wrestle the devil with my left hand
Never work for a Zionist, never been a yes man
My art is like Rembrandt painting pictures of death camps
The average person is allergic to the words of wisdom
This is for everyone of Saddam's Kurdish murder victims
And all the pure souls that never had the chance to speak
Truth pumps in my arteries and causes my heart to beat
For soldiers haunted and tortured by guilty memories
Who realised too late to reveal their real enemy
It's all dead wrong
For every victim of racist persecution from Auschwitz to Hebron
My words may sting cowards
For people that were atomised by the Thermite in the Twin Towers
Those living through the wars
Ask me what I do this for
Put the world in its place before it put you in yours

[Hook]
(Singer - Rochelle Rose)
What happens under darkness shall come to light
Can't silence us even though you try

(Lowkey)
You can try to avoid us but it's pointless
You can never avoid the voices of the voiceless

(Singer - Rochelle Rose)
Take our freedom, Can't take our pride
Come what may we will survive

(Lowkey)
You can try to avoid us but it's pointless
You can never avoid the voices of the voiceless

[Immortal Technique]
Keep my third eye hidden under my New York fitted
A crazy unmarried man that deserves to be committed
The future is encrypted in my troubled lyrics
Dream that I've been somewhere for weeks, then wake up in a couple minutes
Sweat dripping with visions of population control
Thoughts overflowing my world like the melting of the North Pole
My people are targeted by military crack committees
So I'm bucking at the feds like natives in Rapid City
Reality savage, my words are like a riot in Paris
The voice of the voiceless, that voice is social imbalance
So stand strong or sit harder in your mental palace
Blinded inside a Kingdom united to its old habits
But now, Middle Passage coming, War Chant, African drumming
Gatling gun humming
Rapid fire mechanism, reckless living
That checks the rhythm of perfectionism
Slave condition
While you're singing God save the system

[Hook]
(Singer - Rochelle Rose)
What happens under darkness shall come to light
Can't silence us even though you try

(Lowkey)
You can try to avoid us but it's pointless
You can never avoid the voices of the voiceless

(Singer - Rochelle Rose)
Take our freedom, Can't take our pride
Come what may we will survive

(Lowkey)
You can try to avoid us but it's pointless
You can never avoid the voices of the voiceless

[Lowkey]
Detain my body, but you can't imprison my mind
If it's my time I'll probably die with my fist in the sky
These are the thoughts of a man who can't escape from his coma
Cries of a young virgin girl who got raped by them soldiers

[Immortal Technique]
Birthing a screaming bastard, post colonial nation
Subject to childhood diseases, famine, war and inflation
Education molded you into your masters image
And you forgot who the fuck you were before the war was finished

[Lowkey]
You're hearing the ghosts of Nagasaki, You're hearing Hiroshima
Beautiful babies being born with the weirdest features
You might never see me in the charts
But Inshallah my seed can see peace in Iraq

[Immortal Technique]
But peace and freedom can never be given
That's historically forbidden, Cos only collision is the recipe
Changing the course of destiny
So I'm strapped with weaponry

[Lowkey & Immortal Technique]
Cause the government don't give a fuck about protecting me

[Hook]
(Singer - Rochelle Rose)
What happens under darkness shall come to light
Can't silence us even though you try

(Lowkey)
You can try to avoid us but it's pointless
You can never avoid the voices of the voiceless

(Singer - Rochelle Rose)
Take our freedom, Can't take our pride
Come what may we will survive

(Lowkey)
You can try to avoid us but it's pointless
You can never avoid the voices of the voiceless"
