Yo
This is Poison Pen, with a message to the industry coon
No matter how Hollywood you think you are
No matter how many records you sold
No matter how many chains you rock
How big your rims are, or how shiny your freaking grills are
This is what they think about you

"(?) NIGGER!"
"Burn the Mexican flag for American"
"He's a nigga!"
"The Qu'ran is a document of slavery and shatel"
"He's a nigga! (Oh my God) A nigga look at the nigga!"
"Don't tell me I need re-education, they need deportation"
"We need to close our borders and this needs to be a white country like our forefathers founded it"

Keep shucking and jiving and showing ya teeth, bitch
