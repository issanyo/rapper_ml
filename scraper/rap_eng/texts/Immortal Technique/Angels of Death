[Verse 1: Planetary]
Battling Plan's a bad plan
I'm raw like cats from Afghanistan with gats in their hands
From Philly to Pakistan 'space packin the stands
You make all fake thugs start acting like Stans
You'll never make your move cuz you lackin the fans
I been illin' since I had a backpack full a cans
You see life pass by you in the blink of an eye
Thinkin you fly, we'll choke you in the sink till you die
You spit lava rap, so holla back if need be
You'll burn if you step, believe me, come see me
I'll make you see moons in the break of day
And make sure that your body slowly starts to decay
It's gruesome, I had to add my two cents
The next movement in rap guess who's sent
Outerpsace nigga, and we demand we eat
And if not we gonna leave a bloodbath in the street nigga

[Interlude: Vinnie Paz]
They asked me, concerning the spoils of war
Such spoils are the disposal of God and the apostles
So fear God, and keep straight the relations between yourselves
Obey God and his apostles if ye do believe
I'm so confused, take the world away

[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]
I'm a maniac, you need to watch who you war with
You in the land of stars when the block is enormous
Squash rocks with my hands, my palms is enormous
Flow the hot lava that I drop when I scorch it
Droppin candy rappers that get chopped up and snorted
Newborn kids they get chopped up, aborted
Planet warchild, when we pop up report it
Committin riot acts so we constantly torch it
Illest Puerto-Rock this whole process is morbid
Equipped with slaughter blocks, you get the picture-a portrait
If it ain't monetary, what's your reason for touring
All that shit you pop, to be honest it's boring
Been rockin the mic since before it turned corporate
You need to sit back and let your conscience absorb this
Before you ship that demo to them dudes in the office
Come test your skills for real in hell's fortress

[Interlude: Vinnie Paz]
I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth
Holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth
Or on the sea, or on any tree
I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise
Having the seal of the living god
He cried with a loud voice to the four angels
I'm so confused
To whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
Immortal Technique, I live life strangling death
I walk through the land where the fallen angel is kept
But I will never bow down to a Pagan habit
Like Roman gods that were faggots named after the planets
The connotations of Revelation taken for granted
Mark of the beast, government microchips implanted
I'll be branded a maniac for speaking the truth
And I'll be murdered as soon as I hit the street with the proof
Illuminati trying to raise the devil at any cost
They probably cloned Jesus with the blood off of the cross
And I know that it's the same mother fuckers I see
That genetically engineered HIV
Controlling the population according to mathematics
Generated by Masons and the military industry
Sponsoring terror, creatin the profit margin that'll last forever
The crusades and Vietnam sand-blasted together
And you believe in "whatever", even a Federal promise
But the spawn of Shaytan could never be honest
And poor people pay homage and pray to a god
That the Vatican themselves don't really believe in
Cuz they'd rather worship money and the physical demons
Without biblical reason I execute em for treason
I don't need an alibi, cuz my place in history is the book of Malachi
Motherfucker

[Outro]
Immortal Technique; Harlem, New York and North Philly
The Angels of Death are here you motherfucker
We'll turn your cities to salt, nigga
Y'all ain't shit, and none of your peoples are shit
None of your children are shit
You'll all be dead tomorrow, you fake motherfuckers
What!?
