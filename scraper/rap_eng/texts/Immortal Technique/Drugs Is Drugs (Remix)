"Don't worry, the drugs will kick in mortal"

[police on radio] - "Yeah, yeah two units in front and three behind me.  We're at the near 40, ??? is with me.  He's on the 105 east down approachment 110 interchange.  Just left over the number one lane.  We gonna hear a 20,000." "Yes sir."

Chorus:

Drugs is drugs, can't nobody tell me different
Only the man, 'cause he controls my shipment
Get guns, strap then go the distance
Get funds, clap with no resistance
[2X]

[Verse 1 - Hugh Hayes:] "I need drugs"

Ya I'm in drug court treatment, 'cause my mind's morphined in
Drug laws got me poppin' Tylenol P.M
Thugs all see me and they slide me off G's end
'Cause I hustle aspirin, grindin' all weekend
You cook crack, no time off, you workin' serious
I push packs of Midal in certain periods
I could smack you guys hard just for flarring up
And you could take these five bars for that papercut
Side effects crazy, take this and have babies
And all you was trying to do was treat rabies
I got the cure for aids, that's why they want to lock me up
'Cause these greedy mothafuckas gonna lose a lot of bucks
And all these pills, that's why I keep poppin' up
Your pharmacy ain't fuckin' with us, it's obvious
Can make chips off this shit I love
Either over the counter, or prescription drugs

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Diabolic]

Yo, yo, I used to go to Folton for weed bags and nicks
And break sheets of LSD to five dollar acid hits
The media calls me a lowlife, laughing at Bolic
Put coke in crack when I chopped it, put cash in my pocket
Got news reporters making sure my fuse is shorter
When china white gives me more than you could offer
The government taught ya that we scum drug dealers
A bunch of thug killas, but the truth is much realer
The truth is, we move bricks to give to you
And 10,000 packs of X topped from acidic juice
This shit is true, I move it all, drugs is drugs
Giving young bucks a hundred packs to flood the clubs
Love is love, don't ask why we cockin' these gats
You push us in a corner and expect us not to react
I watch police watching me while they lock the streets
But that don't change the fact that my daughter gotta eat

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Immortal Technique:]

Yeah, I'm tryna school these young hustlers, stuck in the game
Shooting niggas over shipments that are loose change
So while you playing in snow like it's Christmas nigga
Just remember that prison is a business nigga
From the off-shore drill and platform process
The C.I.A., heroin inside Vietnam Vets
The government bring us the product that we distribute
And we become the negative image that they attribute
We need to unite soldiers and polly the hood nigga
'Cause you don't see the D.E.A. in Hollywood nigga
While the hip-hop 5/0 stuck to the penis
Tryna interrupt gang unification between us
The devils do us dirty when they not ignoring us
From Malcolm X to that muthafucka from The Warriors
The righteous among us, to the ghetto politician
Just remember that we never own the pot that we piss in, mothafucka

[Chorus]

"Everybody, him, you, you're dead already"
