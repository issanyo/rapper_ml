[intro: Rok One]
Platinum Ice!
Y'all don't hate on big next
Y'all don't hate on big next
Cause if you do you'll get fucked up
You'll get fucked up for life
Y'all don't hate on rok one
Y'all don't hate on rok one
Cause if you do you'll get fucked up
You'll get fucked up for life

[Verse 1: Rok One]
I spit the type of shit that makes cats throw in the the towel
The type of shit that makes it hard to hold in your bowels
And I go to war like Colon Powell
And shoot my flows straight and narrow the glow holds through your bone marrow
Poison arrows rip through your clothes and apparel
I couldn't care if you rock more gold than a pharaoh
Or more ice than Hova
You tyin' to fight this soldier its no dice son your life is over
I'm like a bullet lodged in your right shoulder
You fuck around and come up missing like Mulder
I bring beef with a side of fries and a soda
You're outta here go on peace nice to know ya
My flow unleashed is like ammonia and bleach and I'm
Prone to defeat an opponent that's weak
Son I ain't in this for the love I'm in this so I can eat
And if you rappers try to stop me than you gonna get beat
So you can test me and fail with embarrassment
I'm white but you're the one who pales in comparison
Let it be known even tho I ain't got brown skin tone
I get stupid on tracks it's like I have downs syndrome
Plus an extra chromosome to boost my vocal tone
You think you're living large I'm overgrown like a mobile home
Y'all get broken bones actin like you totin' chrome
Bro please your whole steez is full of gay overtones
Y'all don't fool me with those thug references
We both know what your sexual preference is
Your true colors showing through about as loud as pink
Can't even join a boy band cause you out of sync
Here's what happens when you can't spit without a drink
Or when you let hot 97 tell you how to think
A cat like me gets in that ass about as fast as you blink
Man I could make reformed felons run back to the clink
Sometimes I feel as if I should be facing the shrink
Because for me killing emcees is just a basic instinct
I'll take on any specimen whether white black or Mexican
Bring on the best of em I'll have you all bleeding estrogen
The sickest cat that you heard in your life
I jacked the fucking vocal booth and murdered the mic
Ya'll should call me Berkowitz cause no challenge is iller
You're fucking with a 44 raw caliber killer
A rap valedictorian with the strength of 40 men
You couldn't stop me if you hopped in a Delorean
And went back in time and prevented my folks from meeting
Cause Rok's one emcee you verbal slowpokes ain't beating
Bring it!

[Bridge: Rok One]
Y'all don't hate on rok one
Y'all don't hate on rok one
Cause if you do you'll get fucked up
You'll get fucked up for life
[Immortal Technique]
Y'all don't hate on Technique
Cause i'll take you're drivers license
And i'll kill the oldest and youngest person at that fucking address

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
Some stupid niggas dont care about going to prison
As long as they got another dumb nigga to go with em
But I'm beyond that rhythm cause it ain't my steez
I'm out for the foreign bank accounts with the swiss cheese
To support a foundation for underground emcees
Trying to abolish slavery enforced by record companies
Destroy the bourgeois disease of overseas monopolies
Grieving the industry mercenaries attempt to be clocking me
But they don't understand
I'm revolution there ain't no stopping me
Until even people in other dimensions are boppin to me
Including every entity in every fucking galaxy
I rhyme beyond frequency to reach the powers that be
And hold God to his promise in Malachi chapter 3
I wrote J's with Z's but I'm not a Rockefeller
Even with a laser guided scope you can't see me like Helen Keller
I've giving 30 year old bitches they grew back like they were stellar
But when I'm on the west coast my style is hella nice
Cause I write books on papyrus with the blood of Christ
And leave your body split like genetically spliced mice
I'm nicer than receiving ice for your anniversary
Me and the mic go back like motherfuckers who met in  nursery
You have no type of effect when you spit a verse at me
Like a bitch whose face I nutted on trying to curse at me
Cause I crucified my adversaries mercilessly
Murdered counter-revolutionaries personally
Imagine that, ima smoke a nigga workin with me?
Imagine me catchin a record executive jerkin me
Break a thermometer and force feed his kids mercury
There ain't no lyrical torture on the earth that's worse than me
Most emcees are a plague on humanity like a disease
Fake thugs fake pimps fake playas and G's
That I'll crumble like self defeating racist ideologies
