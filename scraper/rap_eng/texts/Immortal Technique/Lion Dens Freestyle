[Verse One: Immortal Technique]
Yo, they say my words are sinister
So they plottin' my death
Like Nation of Islam Ministers did to Malcolm X
But I'm never stressed I stay with the gat in the ride
Ready for beef like Chicago, with my hat to the side
Glock in the clip, locked and loaded with the body armor
Cold blooded. I don't give a fuck about karma
Cuz if it never comes for those who benefit from misery
Ain't no motherfucking way it could ever do shit to me
There's nothing metaphysically deep about getting shot
Pissing in your pants and vomiting blood on tha block
Witness protection? Try to stay alive on the humble?
Niggas'll hunt you down like dinosaurs, alive in the jungle
And don't mumble when you try to disrespect my bars
I'll throw a chinese nigga at you, infected with SARS
Get banana boat niggas to murder you for a g
Get'em a green card and getchu chopped up for free
Butchu ain't even worth having your body buried
If you was locked up you'd be lap dancing for commissary
Cut the commentary, motherfucker nobody cares
You try to go to Thugs Mansion but nobody's there
Because the judgement day for you is an empty place
And I'm going to send you first class with a hole in your face
I'm taking your space nigga, don't act like you know me
Cause i'll fuck your girl whether she likes it or not, like i was Kobe
I'm Immortal Technique, nigga. You don't want to fuck with that
I'll beat the shit outta your bitch, and take her trucker hat
I'm still angry and bitter, got niggas laughing atchu after you die like John Ritter
