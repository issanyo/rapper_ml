[Intro: Akir]
Yeah, One Enterprises, Viper Records
Presents Akir, Immortal Technique
And this is "Treason," bitch! Uhh

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
I'm not down with the conscious rap, or the Sambos
My flow is cancerous milk, like Monsanto's
Sold through the hood in a package of murder
I'm like white people, get fired and back with a burner
Gauge 5 semi, with the infrared beams
So fuck the Ku Klux and the Combat-18
I put bullets in your spleen, sendin' you to the grave
And through all that, a mothafucker still get paid
And ‘cause of that, some niggas can't stand me, man
But that's the curse of the slave, like Candyman
House niggas that traded they soul to get ahead (jiggaboo!)
And then fucked over for placin' they faith in the feds (Snitch!)
So while the government talk about a mission to Mars
They leave the hood, stuck in a position to starve
Capitalism's a religion that makes Satan a god
And teaches self-righteous people to embrace a facade

{*DP One scratches*: "Say what?"}

[Hook: Akir + Immortal Technique]
It's a cut-throat business the way that we live
Born in the hood, tryin' to see a better life for the kids
It ain't wrong to make money, legit or illegal
But it's treason when you turn your back on your people

{*DP One scratches*: "Say what?"}

[Verse 2: Akir]
Yo, yo, they be manipulatin', politicians delegatin'
Task of perpetratin', sounds like Satan
Makin' racist statements of abomination
Niggas pray to somethin' sacred
Waitin' for that force to save 'em, instead of savin'
Movin' destinations, property papers
Waitin on your 40 acres, 'til you old and ancient
Swole or achin' while the hole is gapin'
To cake to make your way in, I pray to God
But all the amen's in the world'll never make your aim win
Famous celebrities could fall off like leprosy, they tellin' me
So I pay attention, fuck the envy and the jealousy
Y'all niggas could save, Akir's a latest rave
Saw me chillin' on The Source page, fanbases span race
Complete with shorties that blaze, be revered in my old age
From rippin' the stage, and even then from above when I wave
Throwin' flowers on my grave, burnin' sage
Saying, "Thanks, Abe, who made ways for freein' the slaves."

[Hook: Akir + Immortal Technique]
It's a cut-throat business the way that we live
Born in the hood, tryin' to see a better life for the kids
It ain't wrong to make money, legit or illegal
But it's treason when you turn your back on your people

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
Immortal Technique, Indian chief, Lord Sovereign
Bear claw necklace and the puma moccasins
Legal money, motherfucker, you could bring the coppers in
‘Cause I'ma take a shit on 'em, without Johnny Coch-a-ran
Spittin' Prometheus fire, when I speak to a liar
I'm the last of the Essenes that'll teach a messiah
Rip your heart out with the technique of a Maya
‘Cause only snitches and Kanye speak through a wire

[Verse 4: Akir]
Freshest attire, speak with desire, close to the passion
I fall from Elijah, size up the evilest liars
Who think they conspire
Music qualify as paranoia, mental occupiers
Tight, like a pair of pliers, brain's fried up
And so I aspire to erase the pride, usin' amplifiers
To inspire my people, we should hire
Like a lion fightin' vampires, tired on his way to Zion
Never expire, only retire when they call me Sire

[Hook: Immortal Technique + Akir]
It's a cut-throat business the way that we live
Born in the hood, tryin' to see a better life for the kids
It ain't wrong to make money, legit or illegal
But it's treason when you turn your back on your people, yo
