The war against us all. This war in Iraq isn't the end; it's the beginning of wars to come, all around the world, at the whim of the Neo-Cons in the White House. This is the Bush Doctrine come to life; War, war and more war! War brought to you by the big corporate-masters who run the showThis isn't just a War on Iraqis or Afghanis or Arabs, or even Muslims. It is ultimately a War on us all! That's because the billions and billions that are being spent on this WarThe cost of tanks, rocketry, bullets and yes even salariesFor the 125,000 plus troops, is money that will never be spent on education, on healthcare, on the reconstruction of crumbling public housing Or to train and place the millions of workersWho have lost manufacturing jobs in the past three years alone The War in Iraq is in reality; a war against the nations' workers and the poor who are getting less and less While the big Defense industries and making a killing - literally! What's next Iran, Syria, North Korea, Venezuela? We've already seen the corporate media Playing aphone to the White House, to build and promote a War based on lies. War is utilized by the imperialists, first and foremost, to crush internal enemies. We're seeing the truth of its insight When we see the sad state of American education The rush of seniors to buy affordable medications from the Canadians Because American drugs are just too expensive The threat of privatization of Social Security And the wave of repression that comes with an increasing Militarized Police; This is a War on all of us And the struggle against War is really a struggle for a better life For the millions of folks who are in need here in this country! The fight against the War is really to fight for your own interests Not the false interests of the Defense Industry Or the corporate media, or the White HouseDown with the Wars for empire!
