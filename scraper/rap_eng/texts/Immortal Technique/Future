[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]

Far on the moon and dreaming of conquering planets
But haven't overcome basic human behavior to savage
Average apathy eclipses actual tragedy
And the fact that it detracts from peoples’ moral capacity
History cooked up and cut up like Mac and cheese
Truth selectively removed like the book of Maccabees
Genetically altered athlete digital salary
Economic paper collapse equal internet magazine
Dazzling rebirth of the Nazarene
Crucified by Neo-con Romanized drag queen
Year of the 4th president, grandchildren inheritor
Religiously splinted urban warfare America
Naturally moving, the birth of a new human
That selects to reject, technology’s illusion
Starting a shift in the outlook for a 22G
The planet is earth, the year is 8000 BC
