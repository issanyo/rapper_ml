Ayo, I try to relax, max chill with my kid
Still cats getting shot in front of my crib
I try to chill, think "man this ain't no way to live"
So I don't trip, I dip but I ain't afraid of shit
Cats get it twisted cause' I don't call it goons
Like I can't have my cousin see your mothers room
I ain't a soft dude, like some assume
I got a gully crew and they got a hundred tools
I been tellin yall cats its a hundred jewels
I'm from the boneyard crews with a hundred dudes
I been paying dues, doing shows and mixtapes, shit
But still my click sprays shit
Lot of cats lookin at me like the clique ain't shit
But we still up in the hood with them radio spins
Do you know what its like for you to have fame
But your life ain't change, not a dollar to your name?
I bang, so I'm back where the stick-up kids rob chains
Where you get shot for a pair of Lebron James
I got them long things, and they all bang
But I ain't tryna turn your night to a long day
You might be the one if I got the right aim
It might be your son if I got the wrong aim
And that's the raw thing, you wanna think about
So you better think it out, before you rob the wrong chain

[King Magnetic] (Official verse lyrics)

Rap got me hustling, strappin the gun again
Blast if they comin in, wrath of the government
Laugh til republicans, taxing our publishing
Mask if you bubbling, asking you once again
To pass off the fucking rent - brothers is broke
Never ate with a phony - can't stomach the hoax
Coming too close to death, I ain't tryin to wig
My mixtape's sponsored by Coke, without the fuckin IronPigs
Allentown native surrounded by labor
Haters that neighbor the cradle plus the craver of craters
Invading til we raided or graduating to weighing weight
Debating on waiting or taking garbage until your straight, (thats right)
Hold your breath for me, lay you down on a stretcher seat
When I'm really tryin to vent like a skecher sneak
Until they wrestle me for vesting in that recipe
All I had left was three, so these muthafuckas ain't stressin me

[Immortal Technique]

Break it down...

When you talk revolution niggas take it the wrong way
Think you on some Gandhi shit starving in Bombay
Till you flood their city with heat like it was Pompeii
Have you singing like K-Ci, Jo Jo, and DeVante, (snitch)
Wanna fuck your life up? here’s the recipe nigga;
Try some crystal meth and heroin and ecstasy nigga
Or you could just try fucking ride next to me nigga
Bullet trajectory you’ll hit the ground eventually nigga
Listen, look at your position, is your destiny written?
Is it really free-will that you’re given?
Or a choice from one of gods infinite decisions?
I don’t need any given religion, its state driven
Snake Plissken escape from New York to spread the sickness
Unforgiven baron wasteland apocalyptic
I’ve indictably scripted everything futuristic
So now to the fullest extent is how I live shit
