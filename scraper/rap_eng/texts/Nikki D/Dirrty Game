[Verse 1]
Sex, drugs, money fame
Dirty game I know it mane
Got buddies out the mud who said its love but don't show it mane
So it ain't, nuff to make the toughest mental go insane
Lord bless him in your holy name the boy ain't slept in 40 days
Rain, hail, sleet, snow, even when it's dark or sunny mane
I ain't have nothing left to lose first time I seen all I could gain
So I beat the street just my feet
Look how far I came, up from unpopular lame but now I'm a popular name
See these niggas ain't paid he cost
We both rap they awful I'm awesome
Trap but they pockets went Waldo
Proper but lots of my partners
Trot with a lil chipper for the oppers
We can get shit poppin no problem
You can be the star of this opera
Phantom a menace a monster
Diabolic you should should be cautious
High wattage , shocking your chakras
I got you knocking your noggin
Stoned plus I'm sky like a fox
My style got me hot I'm chewbacca
Bout to take off like a rocket
I don't see no other options

[Verse 2]
Keep a dope 16 we slang
Pour medicine in me drank
Candy sweet it keep lil pimpin sippin til he dizzy mane he spinning like a ceiling fan
I don't want to feel a thing
I pray lord I oughta be saved a sinner with innocent ways
I'm balling bitch I'm jermaine
Money ain't  a thizzy thang
One too many lessons learned
I'm searching for bridges to burn
Knocked down I was out I was hurt
But you just was not too concerned
From no stinking penny to pinch to mint that's fresh out the reserve
Bomb on these bitches until they wave a flag or submerge
I'm strapped to the teethe with my words
I came prepared for the purge
All of my weapons insured
You should just turn to a verb
All of my soldiers concur
They trained to go sit then yessir

[Verse 3]
Imma let you know it's a cold dirty game
Driving so throwed, I done forgot to brake
Eyes on the road I can't make no mistake
Don't break the rules
Cause I know how they play
It ain't cause I can't , I just don't wanna change
Inhaling smoking blowing oh's out my face
You gone, miss your turn if you swerve in my lane
I don't know, I just heard that it burned like a flame
Ain't your mama ever told you not to play with fire
Yelling fuck you bitch, fuck you and you too
Imma go right down the line
Got my story right, vacuum sealed air tight that OJ alibi
I'm sleeping with no shame
Yeah it's a dirty game
