[Intro: Trina + (Ginuwine)]
(Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
This is the one and only, Trina, yeah
(Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
Ginuwine, yeah, what up, Yonny?
You ready for this?

[Verse 1: Ginuwine]
Some of them dancin', some of them drinkin'
Everybody like, "What's up?"
Feels like a party, girls dress naughty
Got the homies like, "What's up?"
They wanna take 'em out like a pitcher
Shawty over there movin' like a stripper
But she ain't the one that I'm tryin' to get
'Cause I'm thinkin' that she might be easy
I'm lookin' for a new type, some that be like
I ain't 'bout leave with you
So I can give her this pimpin'
Girl, why you trippin'?
Tell me what you 'bout to do?
She told she about to go home
But first she gotta stop by the store
She needed double-A's for a new device
So I looked that her and said...

[Chorus]
Girl, put your money away
(Let me give you batteries)
I'll be your double A's
(I'll give you batteries)
Have you screaming my name
(Let me give you batteries)
Just put your toys away
(Give you batteries)
Girl, I'm gonna keep goin', goin' goin', goin'
(I can give you batteries)
Goin', goin' goin', goin'
(Give you batteries)
Girl, I'm gonna be goin', goin' goin', goin'
(I can give you batteries, give you batteries)

[Verse 2: Ginuwine]
I can do it so good, you can call me oakwood
Beat it like a triple-X star
I run like a marathon, make you wanna tell your mom
Mama, he the best by far
Have you comin' back for more
All you gotta do is open up the door
I'll deliver the goods like a postal man
All you gotta do is give me that address
A double shot of Henny is all you gotta give me
I'ma make it do what it do
So what it's gon' be, babe, is you leavin' with me?
Baby girl, what you tryna do?
She said that she don't wanna be alone
I think that she's about to take me home
Next time you run into a lonely girl
Just look at her and say, yeah...

[Chorus]
Girl, put your money away
(Let me give you batteries)
I'll be on double A's
(I'll give you batteries)
Have you screaming my name
(Let me give you batteries)
Just put your toys away
(Give you batteries)
Girl, I'm gonna be goin', goin' goin', goin'
(I can give you batteries)
Goin', goin' goin', goin'
(Give you batteries)
Girl, I'm gonna be goin', goin' goin', goin'
(I can give you batteries, give you batteries)

[Verse 3: Trina]
Energizer Bunny, you ready to get inside?
Can you keep up? Well, let me take you for a ride
Introduce my waterfall while I climb on top
Make sure you charged up 'cause I don't wanna feel it stop
Go all night, go on and on and on
Travis Parker get 'em drums, hit me 'til you make a song
Make me do the shake, tell me how I taste
Guinness World Record, how much nookie can you plate?
Cut it like a steak, make me sweat 'til I faint
The bedroom's a sauna, now make me lose weight
500 degrees with steam coming out my body
If you a G, be a G, you gotta hit the G-spot

[Chorus]
Girl, put your money away
(Let me give you batteries)
I'll be on double A's
(I'll give you batteries)
Have you screaming my name
(Let me give you batteries)
Just put your toys away
(Give you batteries)
Girl, I'm gonna be goin', goin' goin', goin'
(I can give you batteries)
Goin', goin' goin', goin'
(Give you batteries)
Girl, I'm gonna be goin', goin' goin', goin'
(I can give you batteries)
Goin'
