Out the cockpit of my Lear
That's dirty money (Uh-uh)
You starving hungry (That's right)
I got a million in singles
Take it all off shake it for me

No rainin'
My millions hydro-planin'
And I'm done with San Tropez-in'
In my Lambo Ice Capadin'
I'm richer than all the riches in the world
You ain't no groupie
And I ain't tryin' a' buy you

Million dollar smell

These heels ain't out till next season

I'm in that pink Ferrari
I got a thing for Porsches
I like my men like my cars
Strong and built like horses
Glass of chardonnay, I'm far from average
Rich and lavish
And that's why I am the baddest bitch
