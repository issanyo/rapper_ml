[Chorus: Trina]
I only fuck with niggas in them Lambos (Gallardo)
I only fuck with niggas in them Lambos (Murcielago)
Doors going up, hoes going HAM
Doors going up, hoes going HAM
I only fuck with niggas in them Lambos (Gallardo)
I only fuck with niggas in them Lambos (Murcielago)
Doors going up, hoes going HAM
Doors going up, hoes going HAM

[Bridge: Trina]
Niggas buyin pussy, niggas buyin pussy
Niggas buyin pussy, niggas buyin pussy

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Geechi Liberace, dope boy in Versace
Came from beefaroni, all I see is lobster
Lamborghini lover, keep my bitches topless
I pay them boys to do it, keep my record flawless
May run for state attorney just to free my dogs
I chose to run these streets until I was a boss
Don’t call it yo house until you paid it off
I pay up for a mouth just like a round of golf
I try to stay in shape, I’m standing counting ones
Red Lamborghini, bitches know I’m drivin one
Niggas buyin pussy, boss buyin pussy
I could buy the club, boss buyin toosies
Diamonds on my neck, call me K.O.D
I just want her for her neck, so I pay the fee

[Chorus: Trina]
I only fuck with niggas in them Lambos (Gallardo)
I only fuck with niggas in them Lambos (Murcielago)
Doors going up, hoes going HAM
Doors going up, hoes going HAM
I only fuck with niggas in them Lambos (Gallardo)
I only fuck with niggas in them Lambos (Murcielago)
Doors going up, hoes going HAM
Doors going up, hoes going HAM

[Bridge: Trina]
Niggas buyin pussy, niggas buyin pussy
Niggas buyin pussy, niggas buyin pussy

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
When I bought my Lamborghini I paid cash nigga
Crack money, got it out the stash nigga
I got a Need For Speed, I’m in the sport cars
I fuck with feds just like I did my sport cars
I’mma let you niggas buy the pussy
I may tip her for the head then I keep it pushin
Hoes chasin that bag, 200 on my dash
I’m 200 with my niggas, I bring 200 with me back
Bitch you bad and I know it, in your Honda Accord
You gon be strippin, sellin pussy til you make it to the Forbes
And my bitches be exotic, I pull up in the hunned
So white, so exotic, all set Forgiatis
And the man back grindin with my Maybach squad
Then you bitches cookin' up until the yay jump hard, bitch!

[Chorus: Trina]
I only fuck with niggas in them Lambos (Gallardo)
I only fuck with niggas in them Lambos (Murcielago)
Doors going up, hoes going HAM
Doors going up, hoes going HAM
I only fuck with niggas in them Lambos (Gallardo)
I only fuck with niggas in them Lambos (Murcielago)
Doors going up, hoes going HAM
Doors going up, hoes going HAM

[Bridge: Trina]
Niggas buyin pussy, niggas buyin pussy
Niggas buyin pussy, niggas buyin pussy

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
My campaign sip Belaire, I smoke til no air there
Them monkey niggas some care bears, I’m tokin on my tear gas
My molly look like real glass, fuck feelings, I feel cash
I tuck ceilings and peel past ya, plastic cars are still ratchet
Don’t need cuts, real Caspers, double M, real bastards
Body count, real caskets, pimpin' on them Cleopatras
Just money, me and that, just AK, we not just MIA
We in action, don’t turn this in a reenactment
I’m just tryin to be a real rhymer, still swaggin, see about you
Try fuckin with me and my shit, nah, that’s that Vietnam shit
Fuck that BMI shit, I got me a ki, I’m outchea
Plus that Beamer dot ya, arrivederci
Ain’t pleading mercy, just Lambo free and mercy
Break bitches, pee in purses, fuck hoes and they reimburse me

[Bridge: Trina]
Niggas buyin pussy, niggas buyin pussy
Niggas buyin pussy, niggas buyin pussy

[Chorus: Trina]
I only fuck with niggas in them Lambos (Gallardo)
I only fuck with niggas in them Lambos (Murcielago)
Doors going up, hoes going HAM
Doors going up, hoes going HAM
I only fuck with niggas in them Lambos (Gallardo)
I only fuck with niggas in them Lambos (Murcielago)
Doors going up, hoes going HAM
