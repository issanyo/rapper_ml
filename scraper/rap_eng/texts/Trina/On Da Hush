[Intro]
Ja-Ja-Ja-Ja-JR

[Chorus: Shonie]
I'll be your undercover lady
I'ma let lose so baby come and take me
We could keep it on the hush
We can do sumthin', can't say nothin'
Champagne bubblin', backseat lovin'
Ain't no need to come face me
I've got the goods to have you goin' crazy
We can keep it on the hush
We can do sumthin', can't say nothin'
Champagne bubblin', backseat lovin'
Yeah

[Verse 1: Trina]
Yeah, I ain't neva played numba 2
But sumthin' bout the way I'm feeling you
It's unexplainable, it's kinda critical
I feel bad that I'm undercover lovin' you
Love? Naw, just infatuated
And I bet your girl hate it cause she always demonstrate it
Why she be lookin' all made and shit?
When she should be the one all glad she gettin'
All that attention, standin' that attention
How can a girl like me get attention?
I won't talk, I'll just lay back and listen
For some strange reason I think you got what I've been missin'
I ain't lyin' I'll be late night wishin'
We'll be playing twister, get in every position
You out fishin', I'm the bait, you the hook
Or we can role play, I'm the [?] you the cook
Yeah

[Chorus]


[Verse 2: Trina]
Can't say nuttin', not a word
The last thing I wanna here is what someone heard
I'm trustin' you to keep this secret in your pocket
Can't let nobody know how I pop, lock, & drop it
On your rocket, when you suck it
Push hard, don't hold back baby, pop it
I can call you on my number, I'm a block it
Don't need no confrontations, tell your baby-mama Stop It!
Cause I'm grown, and you grown
Let's get together, get caught up in the zone
Since both of us single, we can surely get it on
We can get loose, do it baby till the crack of dawn
So tell the truth, I'm sure you wanna hear me moan
We can get busy on my video phone
You out fishin', I'm the bait you the hook
Or we can role play, I'm the [?] you the cook
Yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Trina]
So tell me what you think, think you can roll wit me?
Creepin' on the low, late night sneakin', come and get me
Can't get your feelings in, that's the wrong move
Gotta play it by ear, keep it real cool
I can be your get-away, when you wanna get away
Step into my private spa, let me help you get away
No aggravation, we don't need to fuss
We'll be on another planet, it'll all be bout us
Keep it on the hush, our private crush
Even though we sneakin' round, we [?] trust
It's so funny how we feelin' one another
When we in public how we know we secret lovers
Don't forget the purpose, I'm ready for tonight
For you to rub my body good, make love to me right
You out fishin', I'm the bait you the hook
Or we can role-play I'm the [?] you the cook
Yeah

[Chorus]
