Watch this when I pull up we just watch them stare
Watch this what you seeing is so very rare
Watch this, stunt so hard but I don't really care

Look at my car, look at my wrist
Look at my heels, look at my life
Nigga I'm on one, I'm on one
Look at my squad, looking so mean
Chapta 16(?), looking so clean
Nigga we winners, we winners

You should watch this, when I talk it I am so ?
Watch it, for the drama I am so prepared
Watch this, I can show you all the ? are here
Watch this, watch this, watch this

When I work it, just like magic all the benz appear
I know you know it though, who got all the eyes in here
Flexin, flexin, flexin, flexin, like a body bill
A money ritual, bitches (?)

Whole team on one now, smelling like that octane
Take another one, now i feel like fuck fame
Hit that kryptonite, celebrate that flip tonight
I am with the shiz tonight, I might fuck a mil tonight

Watch this, when I pull up we just watch them stare
Watch this, what you seeing is so very rare
Watch this, stunt so hard, but I don't really care
Watch this, watch this, watch this

Look at my car, look at my wrist
Look at my heels, look at my life
Nigga I'm on one, I'm on one

Look at my squad, looking so mean
Chapter 16(?), looking so clean
Nigga we winners, we winners

You should watch this, when I talk it I am so ?
Watch it, for the drama I am so prepared
Watch this, I can show you all the dudes are here

You can't touch this, too legit its always hammer time
Watch it, Just like feds they snapping pictures now
Problems, I got solvers on the 95

Im always guccied up, tap me with that ice-cream sign
Snappin', let 'em see a mogul millionaire
(?), keep them bottles in the air
Flamo, louder than the fucking (?)
Rambo, going crazy in the amazair(?)

Watch this, when I pull up we just watch them stare
Watch this, what you seeing is so very rare
Watch this, stunt so hard but I don't really care
Watch this, watch this, watch this

Look at my car, look at my wrist
Look at my heels, look at my life
Nigga I'm on one, I'm on one

Look at my squad, looking so mean
Chapter 16(?), looking so clean
Nigga we winners, we winners

You should watch this, when I talk it I am so (?)
Watch it, for the drama I am so prepared
Watch this, I can show you all the (?) are here
Watch this, watch this, watch this

To my haters, I love you for the motivation
Ain't got no feelings though
Whip it, whip it, whip it bake it
Baller, got me feeling like an athlete
I'm so Serena with the serve, ?

Ya'll imitators just stop, I really am, and you not
Realest bitch to ever do this shit
Need more than just a mad shot
You should clock me, hundred Maserati, woah
My time and my money never come in slow
I'm a paper chaser on my cardio
I talk a lot of shit but you already know
