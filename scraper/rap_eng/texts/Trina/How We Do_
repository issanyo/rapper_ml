[Verse 1: Trina]
Icy blue rocks on my arm I shop in Milan for Louis Vuitton
The diamond diva miss Cinderella, Versace gown by Donna Tella
And can't none of these hoes out floss me
Gator boots by Sergio Rossi
Ms. Trina I got to splurge
Figure eight frame baby watch the curves
Walk in the club don't waste no time
Hit the bar up two cases of wine
Cute face thin waist line
Drop to the beat pop to the base line
To all my girls that's kickin it
You got Cris in yo glass and you sippin it
You bout money and you gettin it
We tight that's right. Uh

[Hook: Fabolous & Trina]
(Hey) This how we do!
(Hooo) Yall can't deny
(Hey) This how we do (whoa)
I'm the baddest far from the average (Hey)
Diamond Princess (whoa)
Ghetto F-a-b (hey)
This how we do (whoa)

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
I like my ladies off the glass like shootin off the back board
Sexiest mommies beautiful as black broads
Cutest rude girl, thick as Caucasian
Pretty as Cape Verdean, slick as Malaysians
Ask them let them bitches say yes sir
Young and live among riches in West Jerve
Switch in the excurve
Strut through this bitch in the best furs
Bitch in a Lex Jerse
Twin gray crosses (bling) I'm the might cone
Brightly chrome vendaidoes
Cover your girl face
From the Bruce Lee Roy glow
On a mother a pearl face
All I do is say one word
Yall say it's foolish
I send splurge
I'm a lose 1/3
I never go broke my name got two o's
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S

Chorus (repeat)

[Verse 3: Trina]
Nice lips, nice thighs, nice hips
Pussy tighter then a pair of vice grips
I don't pay niggas, niggas pay me
(I'm a hustler baby) like Jay-Z
It's the diamond princess million dollar mistress
From the M-I home of the stop bitches
Cristal, and caviar bitches, twist this game for all you fly bitches
I Spit nuttin but the hot shit, you got the four dot get the four dot six
Maybe than you can ride with a hot bitch
VS from the anklet to the wrist
I been in the game just two years
End a few careers there it is
But now I'm back on top again
With some red hot shit for you to cop again (Yeah)

Chorus (repeat 2)
