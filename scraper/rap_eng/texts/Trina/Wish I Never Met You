I wish I never met you boy …
And its killing me to know that I can't have you in my world
I wish I never met you boy …
If I can turn back time, then I'll make it so that you were my boo
I wish I never met you boy …
Every time I'm with my man, all I do is sit and think of you
Don't wanna feel the way I feel about you

[Trina]
When we first got together, I saw us chillin forever
A lifetime, best friend for worse or for better
Then you switched up the weather, sunshine to clouds
I found a condom in ya dresser, and you know how we get down
You fucking clown now I wish I never met cha
I shoulda listened to mama, she said you wasn't nothing special
So now its to the left, to the left
And everything you own is on the porch
Nigga step and tell me …

[Shonie]
What would you do if u were in my shoes?
Would you make it go go or would u wanna choose
Between the one you love and between the one u hate
Cuz that's just how it is …

I wish I never met you boy …
And its killing me to know that I can't have you in my world
I wish I never met you boy …
If I can turn back time, then I'll make it so that you were my boo
I wish I never met you boy …
Every time I'm with my man, all I do is sit and think of you
Don't wanna feel the way I feel about you

[Trina]
Maybe im trippin, oh I just can't figure u out
One night u say u love me, the next u flippin out
But u can bounce, u kno I don't need a man
Im sorry I met u. I could do bad by my damn self
I can't let u disrespect me ima queen. And all my real
Boss chicks know what I mean
I bet u still trickin, you ain't learned ya lesson
Now let me check ya text messages … now tell me .. hahaaa

Don't wanna feel the way I feel about you

Picture me and u together
Everything about you make my whole body shiver
Its you I want in my world, its you that I adore
I said I picture me and u together
Everything about you make my whole body shiver
Its you I want in my world, its you that I adore
