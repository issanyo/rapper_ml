You must have it twisted or have a shortage
I ain't even empty handed I beg your pardon
If I'm departing I'm taking everything cause I'll be damned
If another bitch wore your last name
Put your hands up ladies if you want it all [x3]
Say I want it all [x2]
I want it all [x8]
I went looking for your phone when I shouldn't have cause
I found just what I was looking for
A new number says its Kelly should I call it or should I just ignore
Now I'm sittin' here wondering when you're coming home
Then I thought about it everything that's going on
I gotta leave this relationship but I'm not leaving here
So let me get my list out
What do I want other than this house
First off let me put your ish out call me crazy if
You wanna but I don't care
Now back to my list
Gotta have the house check
Do I want the car check
Do I want the money check
Gotta have it all check
And I deserve it hope it was worth it
And I don't think that I'll be needing your service
I need his house (I need his house)
I need his car (I need his car)
Empty the bank (empty the bank)
I want it all (I want it all)
I gave you all my love and got nothing in return
So now I want it all (I want it all)
I want it all (I want it all)
Give the house (give the house)
Give the car (give the car)
I want it all (I want it all) [x4]
If I'm gonna have to hurt u gonna feel it how I feel it
Play the cards how I deal it
You know I was the realist
Cause the way you going bout this like I never meant shit
Now you want the other bitch cause we had an argument
Ok roll the dice Imma show you how it go
And since u wanna do it dirty watch this fire cracker blow
This ain't no tip or tap shit its all about the principle
How you expect to leave me without a comma or decimal
Pay me for my pain
Pay me for my time
Nigga you can say the bullshit cause everything is mine
From the house in West Pond to the yacht in Burlise
U can keep your sad face baby hand me them keys
Cause the shit you said it did it
Threw me way off track
But when a woman is fed up no it ain't no turning back
Only thing gonna make me smile is if I feel my satisfaction
Is seeing you hurt is fuckin' you suffering while I'm relaxing
So now I need his house (I need his house)
I need his cars (I need his cars)
Empty the bank (empty the bank)
I want it all (I want it all)
I gave you all my love and got nothing in return
So now I want it all (I want it all)
I want it all (I want it all)
Give me the house (give me the house)
I need the car (give me the car)
I want it all (I want it all) [x3]
Put your hands up ladies if you want it all [x3]
Say I want it all [x2]
I want it all [x8]
I need his house
I need his car
Empty the bank
I want it all
I want it I want it
I earned it (nothing in return)
Your a liar your a cheater
Give me what I need
I'll leave you alone if you give what I please
Ooohhh I want it all
Ooohhhhhoohhhhh be a man about it
Put your hands up ladies if you want it all (you know what you did to me)
Put your hands up ladies if you want it all [x2]
Say I want it all [x2]
I want it all
