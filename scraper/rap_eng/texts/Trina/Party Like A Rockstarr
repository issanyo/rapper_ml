I rock my body like a rockstar
Live like a moviestar

Fuck like a pornstar

You can call me Pamela
Anderson plus I rock the stage like Marilyn Manson
No hands, no skirt

[Verse 2]
It's the rockstar extraordinaire
Throw ur hands in the air
Wave 'em like you just don't care
Patron shots everywhere
Crash a party anywhere
If you don't like me, I don't care
I know u looking,  gone stare
I got haters everywhere
Catch me in a fast car
Kind of like Nascar
The boys screamin' Trina stop
But Trina screamin' Kidd Rock
Just found out I got a stalker
Oh my God it's Travis Parker
Told you I'ma superstar
Come party with a rock star
