Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you
All I can do, is just think about you
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
All I can do, is just think about you
Thinking of you

[Verse 1: Trina]
I'm visualizing, me and you on an island
Black sand, holding hands, and covered in diamonds
Look up in the sky it's a unicorn
And I can't get enough of how you do me boy
I see me ripping off your clothes, kissing on your chest
I'm down to your stomach so you know what's coming next
My fantasy, a trip, I'm thinking bout the hot spot
Late night, skype conversations from the laptop
Got your t-shirt on, your cologne on it
Make me feel like you still right at home in it
Check your phone come help me take off this negligee
And he replied with a lol smiley face

[Hook: Privaledge]
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
All I can do, is just think about you
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
All I can do, is just think about you
Think about you, think about-

[Verse 2: Privaledge]
And I'm legs up, arms back
Squeezing on your thighs
Make that ass feel fat
I'm just visualizing it, you telling me where it's at
I'm a put my mouth on it, whatever to get it wet
Cause I just wanna see you smile when it's over with
Lay in bed and talk about how we grow and shit
First kiss upon your neck then go to your hip
Dynamite dick, how you think Napoleon hit
Bomb, you be looking bomb
Dress good, smell good, that should be a crime
Even on skype I'm checking you from behind
And you could have the world
As long as I know you're mine
Girl I'm thinking of you

[Verse 3: Trina]
The way you hold me down
The way you put that tongue on me
You know my facial expressions, boy, when I get horny
You're such a monster
You make the pussy cry
When I can't stop moaning
You already know why
Cake keep bouncing, and I keep on announcing
That it's all yours
Make me drip like a fountain
Wet aquafina, bedroom ballerina
Waterfall, make me come
Now throw me that ah
Bed ringer, hot topic
I'm thinking bout you no doubt about it
I'm laying cross the bed, and you doing it
My maintenance man, put your screw in it (yeah)

[Hook: Privaledge]
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
All I can do, is just think about you
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
All I can do, is just think about you
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
All I can do, is just think about you
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
All I can do, is just think about you
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
All I can do, is just think about you
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
All I can do, is just think about you
Thinking of you
