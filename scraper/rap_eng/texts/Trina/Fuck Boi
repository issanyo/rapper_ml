(Verse 1)

Six in the morning nigga at my do'
I'm trying to figure out what he out there foe'
Last time I seen him he was talking shit
Found out his new girl can't suck no dick
Hit the intercom I ain't let him in
Pussy nigga lucky I ain't fuck his friends
Probably thought a bitch would be down and out
Till he seen me riding round in that chromed out Benz

(Chorus)

South beach nigga you ain't bout that life
You cross that bridge they taking all that ice
You don't want no problems with them boys from the bottom strip ya ass butt naked and hit the turnpike
You's a fuck boy fuck boy
My bitch been said it that's why I should've let your best friend get it
We went on trips you bought channel but money ain't shit when you soft as hell
Cause you's a fuck boy fuck boy my mama even said it
Gotta new nigga I ain't even gotta sweat it
You still gone talk and that's a god damn shame but a hoe gone be a hoe and a lame gone be a lame
Fuck boy

(Verse 2)

You never heard me asking niggas for shit
You be on the gram asking niggas for pics
Can't believe I let you waste all my time
Now this fuck boy on my voice-mail cryin
Runnin round town with ya bum ass hoe but I'm the blueprint that's why you at my door
She my number one fan that's what makes it sweet bitch'll do anything for a fucking re-tweet

(Chorus 2x)

South beach nigga you ain't bout that life
You cross that bridge they taking all that ice
You don't want no problems with them boys from the bottom strip ya ass butt naked and hit the turnpike
You's a fuck boy fuck boy
My bitch been said it that's why I should've let your best friend get it
We went on trips you bought channel but money ain't shit when you soft as hell
Cause yous a fuck boy fuck boy
My mama even said it gotta new nigga I ain't even gotta sweat it
You still gone talk and that's a god damn shame but a hoe gone be a hoe and a lame gone be a lame
Fuck boy
