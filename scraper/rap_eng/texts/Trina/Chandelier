[Hook: Trina]
Chain swingin' like a fuckin' chandelier
Pulled up, I'm the woman of the year
Baddest bitch, yeah you know I got the sauce
Secure the bag now the haters wanna talk
Chain swingin' like a fuckin' chandelier
Pulled up, I'm the woman of the year
Baddest bitch, yeah you know I got the sauce
Secure the bag now the haters wanna talk

[Verse 1: Kash Doll]
I'm the woman of the year, where my prize at?
Ass too motherfuckin' big, you can't hide that
Year-round, body lookin' like a snapback
They kept sending shots but when I clapback (pow, pow)
Chains frozen like a motherfuckin' igloo
Diamond cost too much for bitches to relate to
Bad chocolate ass bitch from the west side
Second place ain't a winner bitch but you tried
Trina fucking with the Doll, I'm solidified
So I pulled a G5 up to G5

[Hook: Trina]
Chain swingin' like a fuckin' chandelier
Pulled up, I'm the woman of the year
Baddest bitch, yeah you know I got the sauce
Secure the bag now the haters wanna talk
Chain swingin' like a fuckin' chandelier
Pulled up, I'm the woman of the year
Baddest bitch, yeah you know I got the sauce
Secure the bag now the haters wanna talk

[Verse 2: Trina]
You hoes wanna talk, wanna talk that shit like
I ain't snatched off my roof at the red light
I get it focused on the bag
Every morning wake and bake then off to the cash
Big duffle, no luck, my street hustle is all muscle
I strong arm any set and tell my bitches get that bag
Do a run through, hit em with the one-two
VVS cuts and presidents, I can thumb through
I had it all in my face, made it clap clap
Then turned around and pulled the burner and made it snap snap

[Hook: Trina]
Chain swingin' like a fuckin' chandelier
Pulled up, I'm the woman of the year
Baddest bitch, yeah you know I got the sauce
Secure the bag now the haters wanna talk
Chain swingin' like a fuckin' chandelier
Pulled up, I'm the woman of the year
Baddest bitch, yeah you know I got the sauce
Secure the bag now the haters wanna talk
