Owww

(Bridge)
Now it's the part where we break it down (uhuh)
Gon break it down (uhuh uhuh uhuh)
Gon break it down (uhuh) gon' break it down (uhuh)
Gon break it down (uhuh)
Just break it down (uhuh)
Now pick it up (uhuh just put it down)
Now pick it up (uhuh uhuh uhuh)
Now pick it up (uhuh) just pick it up (uhuh)
Now pick it up (uhuh) gon' pick it up (uhuh)

(Verse 1)
I'm fresh off da block, fresh off da press yes
Stay fresh wit the dress fresh sitting in the Lexus
Fellas wanna date us and the heifers wanna fight us
That's the word that got around
That my joint's tight as arthritis
And I gotta hit the club, gotta get some love
Mixing with a lot of other stuff
Now I'm seeing double vision
Baby daddies trippin with they baby mama starting drama
But it ain't no room to fight tonight it's hotter than the sunna
You it gotta be the Trackboyz if it's making that noise
Getting paper too my pockets bigger than the Fat Boys
Gon' look around while I gon' put it down
While you scoping around I'm on the floor getting down
But I gotta give you bits and pieces
Anything else is indecent
The club is packed with heaters
Who don't get mad they get even
It's getting hot in hurrr, tell me how you got in hurrr
See so many fine niggas glad my man not in hurrr

(Chorus - 2X)
Now would you let me put my ass in ya face (in ya face)
(would you let me put my ass in ya face)
If I let you bend me over by the waist (by the waist)
(if I let you bend me over by the waist)

(Verse 2)
Now I'm back once again
Back in the benz
Back with some friends
Stack in them ends
Getting it crackin again
I don't need no writers
Middle finger to the biters
And my shit on more rappers than babies in diapers and cycles
And you can bet that I'm set
Jet in the vet
Aww and don't let me forget
The best you done met yet
And I ain't lying
Catch me buying trying to get inside my tight jeans
The just ain't saying the right thing
No matter how it might seem
They like the way them ghetto girls can get they coochie poppin
Might take you out and wine and dine he will even take you shoppin
Now he gon' keep on spending
Long as you can keep from grinning
Guaranteed that you be winning
This is only the beginning
World gotta know
That this girl gotta flow
And I'm serving them yo
Nuthin like they've heard before
And thats why I give it to them cause I know they want it and they need it
Don't mean to sound conceited
But if you don't eat it leave

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
Now it's the part where we break it down (uhuh)
Gon break it down (uhuh uhuh uhuh)
Gon break it down (uhuh) gon' break it down (uhuh)
Gon break it down (uhuh)
Just break it down (uhuh)
Now pick it up (uhuh just put it down)
Now pick it up (uhuh uhuh uhuh)
Now pick it up (uhuh) just pick it up (uhuh)
Now pick it up (uhuh) gon' pick it up (uhuh)

(Chorus)
