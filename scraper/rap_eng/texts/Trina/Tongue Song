[Intro]
You hear the strings, nigga
But on the flip side of this thong shit
This is what bitches talk about
What niggas need to do with what's in the thong
You heard me?
Uh, yo, check it

[Verse 1]
This might sound so scandalous
But it's the truth and men can't handle it
See most of the times a nigga, they ain't shit
Need to go a step further and lick the clit
Uh, keep lickin' 'til you hit my spot
Nigga, fuck all the juice and the dudes you pop
You gets no scams, just come 'til you pop
Put your face all in my chocha

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm gon' get the nut, nut, nut
Head like what, what, what
Hands are on my butt, butt, butt
You need to lick it again, come on
'Cause I'm gon' get the nut, nut, nut
Head like what, what, what
All night long
Yeah, work the tongue, work the tongue

[Chorus]
I like it when you like it so, da na da na
Baby, make my pussy go, da na da na
I know you wanna hit it so, da na da na
Give me that tongue, to-tongue, tongue, tongue
I like it when you like it so, da na da na
Baby, make my pussy go, da na da na
I know you wanna hit it so, da na da na
Work that tongue, to-tongue, tongue, tongue

[Verse 2]
This might sound so scandalous
But it's the truth and men can't handle it
See most of the times a nigga, they ain't shit
Need to go a step further and lick the clit
Uh, keep lickin' 'til you hit my spot
Nigga, fuck all the juice and the dudes you pop
You gets no scams, just come 'til you pop
Put your face all in my chocha

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm gon' get the nut, nut, nut
Head like what, what, what
Hands are on my butt, butt, butt
You need to lick it again, come on
'Cause I'm gon' get the nut, nut, nut
Head like what, what, what
All night long
Yeah, work the tongue, work the tongue

[Chorus]
I like it when you like it so, da na da na
Baby, make my pussy go, da na da na
I know you wanna hit it so, da na da na
Give me that tongue, to-tongue, tongue, tongue
I like it when you like it so, da na da na
Baby, make my pussy go, da na da na
I know you wanna hit it so, da na da na
Work that tongue, to-tongue, tongue, tongue
I like it when you like it so, da na da na
Baby, make my pussy go, da na da na
I know you wanna hit it so, da na da na
Give me that tongue, to-tongue, tongue, tongue
I like it when you like it so, da na da na
Baby, make my pussy go, da na da na
I know you wanna hit it so, da na da na
Work that tongue, to-tongue, tongue, tongue

[Bridge]
My niggas be talkin' 'bout thongs and shit
I wanna see your face in between my hips
You seen the black gold, you can bring the bitch
Straight, scandalous, you can't handle it
Uh, I like to dance in my 681
Put the feelin' in my pussy, watch smoke a blunt
Straight put you in a trance, no, I ain't no punk
Havin' you dreamin' about my chocha

[Pre-Chorus]
All a nigga wanna do is fuck, fuck, fuck
Head like what, what, what
Cover you in nut, nut, nut
I need to sing it again
'Cause all they wanna do is fuck, fuck, fuck
Head like what, what, what
Cover you in nut, nut, nut
I need to sing it again, come on, uh

[Chorus]
I like it when you like it so, da na da na
Baby, make my pussy go, da na da na
I know you wanna hit it so, da na da na
Give me that tongue, to-tongue, tongue, tongue
I like it when you like it so, da na da na
Baby, make my pussy go, da na da na
I know you wanna hit it so, da na da na
Give me that tongue, to-tongue, tongue, tongue
I like it when you like it so, da na da na
Baby, make my pussy go, da na da na
I know you wanna hit it so, da na da na
Give me that tongue, to-tongue, tongue, tongue
I like it when you like it so, da na da na
Baby, make my pussy go, da na da na
I know you wanna hit it so, da na da na
Give me that tongue, to-tongue, tongue, tongue
