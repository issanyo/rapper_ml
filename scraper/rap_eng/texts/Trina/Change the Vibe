[Intro]
Stick it in the oxhole, baby!
A-audio!

[Hook]
I'm bout to change the vibe on these bitches (Change the vibe!)
I can't even vibe with you bitches (Yeah, I'm done!)
I'm on some other shit, can you feel me? (Can you feel me?)
I'm on some other shit, can you feel me? (Can you feel me?)
I'm bout to change the vibe on these bitches (Change the vibe!)
I can't even vibe with you bitches (Yeah, I'm done!)
I'm on some other shit, can you feel me? (Can you feel me?)
I'm on some other shit, can you feel me? (Can you feel me?)

[Verse 1]
It's a muthafuckin' vibe on my muthafuckin' job
I fuck shit up then I leave, do it all the muthafuckin' time
I ain't lyin', so exotic, been a bad bitch, now I'm wildin'
How you gon' style a stylist, I vacation on a island!
I got a lot, but I want more, bring shit to ya front door
These rap bitches is butt-soft, in the cut like a Band-Aid, [?] off
Veggie egg rolls with the duck sauce, wood wheel [?] guts raw
So fuck off or get dumped on, niggas die every day when they stunt wrong
I'm b-b-b-b-ballin', your nigga keep on callin'
I made him take me shoppin', love to splurge at Neiman Marcus
I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin', you should really pay attention
All you gotta do is listen, I be schoolin' like tuition
Bitch, I'm gifted!

[Verse 2]
I'm runnin' up a band, takin' pictures wit yo man
Tellin' people we just friends, love to do it for the 'Gram!
Fuck you sayin'?  I ain't playin', you bitches better start prayin'
They know that I'm amazing, you bitches just give me basic
I'm countin' them big faces, I got the vision on LASIK
I'm riding with Jamaicans, got it locked just like my Haitians
I run shit, so just face it, I got class and, bitch, you tasteless
If life is what you make it, wanted smoke and caught the vapors!
Money, money, money, stack-stackin' to the ceiling
I'm a fuckin' Rockstarr and all my niggas winners
Sew it up, catch me ridin' with the pump, I be slidin'
In that dunk, so you hoes should know what's up
Fuck is up, bitch?
