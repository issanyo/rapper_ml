[Chrous x2]
I'm cheating, and I'm in love with who I'm cheating with
And when I'm not cheating, everynight's an argument
I know that's something that I really shouldn't do
But I want my cake and wanna eat it too, we both cheating

[Verse 1]
I cheated, I cheated, we played this game that we both needed
You were undefeated, walked around so conceited
Temporary love is what we pretended we needed
Or were we really pretending, cuz now I can't believe it
Look at how I fill this card up, we yelling that we leaving
Knowing it'd would never last, it's only for a season
That you go back to her, and I'll go back to him
When I think of how you do me, I start hating him (I hate you)
I don't know why I'm there, and you don't know either
Maybe just cuz it's convenient just to say that he's my nigga
Or is it just convenient just to say that she ya bitch
And when you doing her, you think of this (you think of this)

[Chorus x2]
I'm cheating, and I'm in love with who I'm cheating with
And when I'm not cheating, everynight's an argument
I know that's something that I really shouldn't do
But I want my cake and wanna eat it too, we both cheating

[Verse 2]
Every night is an argument when I'm not with you
I got a guilty conscious cuz I know my nigga see you
Late at night I'm not in the mood, I'm acting funny
Every conversation I'm talking rude, I'm acting funny
When he be touching on me, I swear it's not the same
I remember one time I called him your name
I played it off though, but who's to really blame?
We're playing a deck of cards, it's a dirty game
The sad part about it is he a good nigga
The temptation got me turnt up forreal nigga
I'm cheating, and I'm caught up in the mix
Tell me when you're with ya girl, do you think of this?

[Chorus x2]

[Hook]
I know that I'm wrong
But this temptation is taking over me
I mean the way that it makes you feel
I feel defeat
He's a really good dude and
He doesn't deserve to be hurt...
But I can't help myself

[Chorus]
