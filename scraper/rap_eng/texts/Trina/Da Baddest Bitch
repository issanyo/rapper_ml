[Chorus: Trick Daddy & (Trina)]
Who's bad? Who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's bad?
(Wait, hold up)
Who's bad?

[Verse 1: Trina]
I'm representin' for the bitches
All eyes on your riches
No time for the little dicks
You see the bigger the dick
The bigger the bank, the bigger the Benz
The better the chance to get close to his rich friends
I'm going after the big man
My g-string make his dick stand
Make it quick, then slow head by the night stand
Like lightning, I wanna nigga with a wedding ring
Bank accounts in the Philippines
Blank note to take everything
See I fuck him in the living room
While his children ain't home
I make him eat it while my period on
A little nasty ho, red-bone but a classy ho
Young jazzy ho and don't be scared
If you're curious just ask me hoes
And yes dick sucking comes quite natural
Cause I'm da baddest bitch, what

[Chorus: Trick Daddy & (Trina)]
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?

[Verse 2: Trina & (Trick Daddy)]
See I hate hoes who take their niggas on talk shows and fought hoes
(Y'all sold, fool)
See if I'm ever crossed or ever caught up in the cross
And if it's your fault ho, I'm going off ho
See I'm unemployed with no boss ho
While y'all sucking dick for free I'm broke off ho
See it pays to be the boss ho
Shit that's how you floss hoes
X-rated elevated, buck naked
And I'd probably fuck your daddy
If your mammie wasn't playa hatin'
Cause I'm da baddest bitch
I'm da baddest bitch, what

[Chorus: Trick Daddy & (Trina)]
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?

[Verse 3: Trina]
I got game for young hoes
Don't grow to be a dumb ho, that's a no-no
See if you off the chains
Stay ahead of the game, save up buy a condo
Sell the pussy by the grands
And in months you own a Benz
Another week a set of rims
See if I had the chance to be a virgin again
I'd be fucking by the time I'm ten
See off glass is my motto
Dick suckin' in the auto
Quick fuckin' 'bout to follow
On the back of the truck
Or when I'm dead ass drunk
But I don't get high though
I never took it up the ass
Often tried but I pass
And from what I heard it ain't bad
I'm a curious bitch who took off to get broke off
From the baby's dad
Cause I'm da baddest bitch

[Chorus: Trick Daddy & (Trina)]
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
(That's right, I'm the baddest bitch)
Who's bad?
