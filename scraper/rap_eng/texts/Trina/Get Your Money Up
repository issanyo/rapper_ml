[Intro]
Stop, now let me see your booty drop

[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
If you think your impressin' us with your ice and dub
Poppin' bottles in the club
Get your money up
Cause I ain't your average girl
I've been all around the world
With your boy, wanna wow me?
Get your money up
Get your money up, boy
Get your money up
I wanna see something bigger than a Hummer truck
Get your money up, boy
Get your money up
You gotta throw something bigger than a hundred bucks

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Now slide slide one of them black cards if you got it then show me how your gettin' it
Diamonds a girls best friend, you can provide them
Might even act a fool while your hittin' it
When you see me in my days blow a whole lot of change
Tell your boy don't get jealous, get your money up
And if you don't like us, there's nothing to discuss
We don't even give a fuck get your money up

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
Get your money up
Get your money up
Stop playin' with yourself, get your money up
Get your money up
Get your money up
Stop, now let me see your booty drop!

[Verse 2: Keyshia Cole]
If you're tearin' the bar down with all the fly women
And still livin' with your momma
Get your money up
If you ridin' big whips, can't take care of your kids, why you lookin' at me?
Get your money up
When I'm up in the club, you know how we roll
Them bottles pop, nonstop
You up in Hollywood, you know how we roll, stop!
Now let me see your booty drop

[Breakdown: Keri Hilson]
Catchin' what I'm talkin' about I don't wanna hear your mouth
You need to put some money down, or get your money up
Why you invadin my space?
Why you get up in my face?, I ain't got nothing to say but get your money up
Get your money up boy
Get your money up
I wanna see something better than the autobus
Get your money up boy
Get your money up
You know my bottle cost more than a hundred bucks

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
Get your money up
Get your money up
(Stop playin' with yourself, get your money up)
Get your money up
Get your money up
Stop, now let me see your booty drop

[Bridge: Keyshia Cole]
Ok now slide slide one of them black cards
If you got it then show me how your getting it
Diamonds a girls best friend, if you can provide them
I might even act a fool while your hittin it
Now grind grind get you some big money and don't forget about me when your spendin' it
But if you ain't gon' pay don't be screamin out "hey girl"
(Wait, now let me see your booty drop)

[Verse 3: Trina]
Now slide slide one of them black cards
Make the pacific ocean be part of my backyard
If you ain't gon pay don't be screamin out hey
I'm an independent honey, I get money all day
Now slide to your bank account, all the cash throw it out
If you ain't yellin diamonds and dollars, I gotta walk it out
Know what I'm talkin about? you steppin to the baddest
Got millionaires standin in line wishin they had this
Take me to Paris, buy 100 carrots, Christian Louboutin boots
Bags and more carrots
You on average
Or at least the wrong section
My girl need some checks so he headin in our direction

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
Get your money up
Get your money up
Stop playin' with yourself, get your money up
Get your money up
Get your money up
Stop, now let me see your booty drop!

[Outro]
I know that's right Keri, your girl KC, and Trina
They gone hate on this one right here
Now get your money up
Get your money up
We don't like them broke boys we don't like them broke boys
