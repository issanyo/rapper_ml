[Verse 1: Trina]
Yes! I am the queen
Feed me diamonds
I don’t need a king
A couple mill, work the bling
Plus my back shot mean
And I’m fresh out the coupe
I’m bout to kill the scene!
Blah! Chicks get back! The Baddest Chick back!
And I’mma make it real hard for ya’ll to come back!
I’m flyer than the sky!
New coupe with the top back!
Damn! I’mma bad chick
But ya’ll already know that!
And I’m undefeated
Blowin’ kisses at you haters cause I’m Miami heated!
Tired of playin’ with you lames
I’m shutting down the game
Hope you had a lot of fun
With your little bit of bank
Beat the drum, blow the horn
For the queen of the south
Heres a new Louis bag for you to shut your mouth!
Roll out the red carpet!
Bring the trumpets out!
Cause the word on the street says I own the south!

[Hook: Lil Mo]
If you really want it, baby we got it
We got the fire, you’ve been waiting for
Homies done did it, but watch how we get it!
You can't keep a strong woman down for long
Cause we taking over
All of my ladies
Cause we taking over
It’ll be crazy
We takin over
Don’t even try to hate
Wish a nigga would!
I’m still hood
Damn right!
(Think I ain’t taking over)

[Verse 2: Jackie-O]
Jackie-O, Jack, Jack the ripper
Big spender, showing love to the strippers
Time for a zippa, sang the song
Can’t be a queen if you ain’t gotta throne
I hear you knocking but nobodies home
You peaking through my window
Sitting in your windows, I’m gone
I’m in the fast lane, on any corner
And I’m breaking the crack game
You know we keep it real B!
Hoods feel me! One false move
Take you out your misery!
I give ‘em more bounce to the ounce!
I’ma show ‘em things they can't even pronounce
I talk greasy, I know what the hands do
H2 and I'm blowing trees like yancy
Detroit brick sanders, queen of rap!
Say my name, I’ll blow you off the map!

[Bridge: Lil Mo]
Cause we taking over
All of my ladies
Cause we taking over
It’ll be crazy
We taking over
So don’t even try to hate
Wish a nigga would!
I’m still hood
Damn right!
Cause we taking over

[Verse 3: Remy Ma]
I am that bitch!
Stunt on niggas! Stunt on chicks!
I like to smoke
I need some crip
I got hoes
I need a strip
I got coke
I need a flip
Why sell O's when I got bricks?
I just get the dough, dont even touch the shit!
And if I blaze, always the purple pip
See the girl how I sets it on fire
I write more than your ghost writer
Ma you're not hard, your vagina
Your a bone thug, you’re not a fighter
Mic check, my check, your provider
You memorize well
You're a good reciter
See, the clock ticks and now its my time-a
I’m the best female rhymer!
Ya dig?

[Hook: Lil Mo]
If you really want it, baby we got it
We got the fire, you’ve been waiting for
Homies done did it, but watch how we get it!
You can't keep a strong woman down for long
Cause we taking over
All of my ladiez
Cause we taking over
It’ll be crazy
We takin over
Don’t even try to hate
Wish a nigga would!
I’m still hood
Damn right!
