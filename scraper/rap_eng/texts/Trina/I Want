I can have whatever I want, I can have anything I want
I can buy anything I want, I can have all the shit that you don't
Whatever I want, whatever I want
I can have what I want, whatever I want, whatever I want
I can have what I want
I can have whatever I want, I can have anything I want
I can buy anything I want, I can have all the shit that you don't
Whatever I want, whatever I want
I can have what I want, whatever I want, whatever I want
I can have what I want

I can have whatever I want, bitch, I'm the shit that you thought
You ain't about a shit, you ain't got shit, fuck any nigga you know
I work these niggas with the magic touch, and even talk on the phone
If your cash ain't acting up, you sayonara, I'm gone
My wardrobe retarded, whole check my closet
Just set peace get low, my middle name's Anati
I head on with my rockstars and just stand the party
Rolex on my arm, shed niggas down with the watches
'Cause I'm on, bitch, I'm on, holyday shit noon
And once I put my game down his main bitch is through
My ass fatter when I make it clap, oh, that's when shit get real
And you're damn right, I can't do shit with a nigga that's still in the gym
To fuck with this bitch you need some aims
Mercy you better, I did the bims
Bad bitch, I pitted you a couple chips
And if you're speaking my language I can even bring through a frame

I can have whatever I want, I can have anything I want
I can buy anything I want, I can have all the shit that you don't
Whatever I want, whatever I want
I can have what I want, whatever I want, whatever I want
I can have what I want
I can have whatever I want, I can have anything I want
I can buy anything I want, I can have all the shit that you don't
Whatever I want, whatever I want
I can have what I want, whatever I want, whatever I want
I can have what I want

I can have whatever I want, we do everything you don't
My money long, my money grown, so main shit for me to flown
Just bought me a new rari, last month Maserati
My bitches bad like trainer, from they face down that body
I hit the mall, don't buy shit, 'cause I already bought the fly shit
Pass it full of bags and tags, told me you gotta try shit
Got the signs, I can't pronounce, hermit's Givenchi
Whip 'em with them whithes, this big calls by fly G
Bitches keep me clean, they all carry selenes
I live your niggas dreams, got real women on team
Lay out, take your daddy and make sure he killing
I can have whatever I want, my money stacks to the ceiling
My crib calls me a million, it's plaid out from chilling
Ain't got no bills, I'm writing this, so hell yeah, I'm chilling
Trying to find a spot in Miami, I'm a superstar, no Grammis
Just griding hard and getting it, now let go of my family

I can have whatever I want, I can have anything I want
I can buy anything I want, I can have all the shit that you don't
Whatever I want, whatever I want
I can have what I want, whatever I want, whatever I want
I can have what I want
I can have whatever I want, I can have anything I want
I can buy anything I want, I can have all the shit that you don't
Whatever I want, whatever I want
I can have what I want, whatever I want, whatever I want
I can have what I want

I can have whatever I want, I can get whatever I need
You niggas don't know what I own
You niggas ain't got no grind, you niggas ain't got no hustle
Nigga like me forever gonna shine
I stay on that greezy, nigga staying busy
I'm making hustle while you see me, till I get busy
Don't rap about what I do really, you rapping silly
DCC, that's my committee, you worth a couple of milli
Therefore I do whatever I feel, I know that Cali kill
Play with that green, stay on that grind, like happy grin
More money equal more power, my power's getting me more money
I went from working the Sundays to the rap game in the ironic
I should write a book, "Getting money for dummies"
Hundreds after one hundreds, I do it after I done it
I said I should write a book, "Getting money for dummies"
Hundreds after one hundreds, I can have whatever I want

I can have whatever I want, I can have anything I want
I can buy anything I want, I can have all the shit that you don't
Whatever I want, whatever I want
I can have what I want, whatever I want, whatever I want
I can have what I want
I can have whatever I want, I can have anything I want
I can buy anything I want, I can have all the shit that you don't
Whatever I want, whatever I want
I can have what I want, whatever I want, whatever I want
I can have what I want
