[Intro: Trina + (Ginuwine)]
(Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
This is the one and only, Trina, Jose
(Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
Ginuwine, yeah, what up, Yonny?
You ready for this?

[Verse 1: José]
I saw you on the dance floor, ain't nobody stoppin' ya
Rolls Royce Ghost, Phantom of the Opera
Foresee the coast, ain't no one on top of ya
I saw you long range with four eyes — binoculars
Drop, drop, drop it low, somethin' that you hurtin' for
I see it in your eyes, baby girl, if you're wantin' more
Disregard the batteries; I'm sorry, but I'm warning ya
They tryna steal my secrets — Krabby Patty formula, ha ha
Not a word, you be quiet
Maintainin' your composure 'fore we start a riot
Stay flamin' in your photo, know you like it private
Work a dance floor, losing weight — diet
Uh, try it, solo but another one
Afterparty then we hit the corner market anyway
Then she pull her purse out, actin' like she playin'
So I look at her and said...

[Chorus: Ginuwine]
Put your money away
(Let me give you batteries)
I'll be your double A's
(I'll give you batteries)
Have you screaming my name
(Let me give you batteries)
Just put your toys away
(Give you batteries)
Girl, I'm gonna keep goin', goin' goin', goin'
(I can give you batteries)
Goin', goin' goin', goin'
(Give you batteries)
Girl, I'm gonna be goin', goin' goin', goin'
(I can give you batteries, give you batteries)

[Verse 2: Trina]
Energizer Bunny, you ready to get inside?
Can you keep up? Well, let me take you for a ride
Introduce my waterfall while I climb on top
Make sure you charged up 'cause I don't wanna feel it stop
Go all night, go on and on and on
Travis Parker get 'em drums, hit me 'til you make a song
Make me do the shake, tell me how I taste
Guinness World Record, how much nookie can you plate?
Cut it like a steak, make me sweat 'til I faint
The bedroom's a sauna, now make me lose weight
500 degrees with steam coming out my body
If you a G, be a G, you gotta hit the G-spot

[Chorus: Ginuwine]
Put your money away
(Let me give you batteries)
I'll be your double A's
(I'll give you batteries)
Have you screaming my name
(Let me give you batteries)
Just put your toys away
(Give you batteries)
Girl, I'm gonna keep goin', goin' goin', goin'
(I can give you batteries)
Goin', goin' goin', goin'
(Give you batteries)
Girl, I'm gonna be goin', goin' goin', goin'
(I can give you batteries, give you batteries)

[Verse 3: Ms. Bee]
I was in the club with my bestie
He was like, "Ms. Bee, girl, you know you sexy
Won't you let me...", I'm like, "You just met me"
And I got toys at home so your game really don't impress me
I kinda liked him but I maintained my game face
Then I vacate, grabbed double-A's on the way home
Alone, worked it out like a shake weight
He said he like a challenge, calling me eight days straight
Went on a date, went on a few more, now he's saying that he can't wait
I think it's time to give him some of this 'oh my'
No lie, when it's over, I put him in a coma
When his soldier's at attention, I'm in heaven, sho'nuff
He's scented like Corona, that's when I set you on her
He like, "Baby girl, you don't need no batteries"
'Cause he beat it up, beat it up like he mad at me
He said that it's the best he ever had
I said "ditto", grabbed my box of toys and threw it in the trash

[Chorus]
Put your money away
(Let me give you batteries)
I'll be your double A's
(I'll give you batteries)
Have you screaming my name
(Let me give you batteries)
Just put your toys away
(Give you batteries)
Girl, I'm gonna keep goin', goin' goin', goin'
(I can give you batteries)
Goin', goin' goin', goin'
(Give you batteries)
Girl, I'm gonna be goin', goin' goin', goin'
(I can give you batteries...)
Goin'
