[Intro: Rick Ross]
Baby, I done spent a million in a week
There ain't nothin' as pretty as your smile
Looks like the skyline
Check

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Anythin' that you want, anythin' that you could have
I ain't window shoppin', shawty, throw it in the bag
I'm from the bottom of the map, I made from the top
The skyline bluer than the blocks in my watch
My baby scream my name (Ross) every time it rains
I know she feel my pain, shawty, nothin' goes in vein
All I do is smile at the bumps and the bruises
Cruisin' in the coupe, or jump in a Land Cruiser
Our relationship is far more sacred
Success complicates it, so back to the basics
Wishin' I could buy time
Eyes closed just picturin' the skyline

[Chorus: Trina & (Rick Ross)]
If you wanna go up high
I'll make it worth your while
To the penthouse suite, just you and me
Carry the ocean on in privacy
If you wanna go up high
Like diamonds in the sky (you know my view)
To the penthouse suite, just you and me (that's what's important to me
Pull the curtains back so you can see (skyline)
The skyline
All this for me? Skyline
I'm lovin' it, skyline
You could be anywhere in the world right now, skyline
But you with me

[Verse 2: Trina]
I done heard it all from the ying to the yang
I done brought it all, Louis V to Vera Wang
I went from coach to first class on all flights
Then coach to Hermes, all ice
I put my life in this music and been around the world
Most men are losers, I put that on my words
Like my top in the summertime, nigga, get lost
I need fresh air, so it's time to take off
I might get a massage, I might have a menage
I might sit back and watch and play like I'm LeBron
Baby still the bomb, you ladies not a threat
When I detonate a man, whole face went
You better check yourself 'cause I could write a check
My skyline blue so my view is the best
I was 17 in the blue VVS
You didn't have a clue, greyin' shoes was a mess
Shine comes with time, mine came with grindin'
Every day I'm alive, I'ma put it on the line

[Chorus: Trina]
If you wanna go up high
I'll make it worth your while
To the penthouse suite, just you and me
Carry the ocean on in privacy
If you wanna go up high
Like diamonds in the sky
To the penthouse suite, just you and me
Pull the curtains back so you can see
The skyline
Skyline
Skyline
Skyline
