"Thug Song"
(feat. Boosie)

Pussy higher like yeah, yeah
(Let the band play)

[Boosie:]
Came in the studio to drop a thug song
(Drop a thug song)
Heard the beat and switched it up, I'm like (I'm like)
Shit, this bitch might be a love song
(Bitch might be a love song)
So many miles away (Miles away)

Came in this bitch to write a thug song
(Came in this bitch to write a thug song)
Heard the beat and switched it up thinkin' 'bout her, I'm like (Ooh)
Man this bitch might be a love song
(Bitch might be a love song)
So many miles away (Miles away)

Girl we been fuckin' round a minute
And I fuck you so one hundred
Girl you know you miss this dick
Distant lover, why you runnin'
You act funny but it'll be all gone (All gone) All gone
If I breathe on your pussy, with your drawers on
Bitch you won't leave your drawers on

I call, I get denied talk (Yeah, yeah) You get drunk
Now you wanna fuck me on the iPhone
She stayin' naked on my iPhone
I was gon' rap about my dawgs and chasin' [?]
But I heard the beat and all I could think about is this bitch from the back

Callin' me zaddy
It's kinda hard to keep my mind off
Your lovin' never gets old
It's kinda hard to keep my hands off

Came in this bitch to write a thug song (Yeah, yeah)
Heard the beat and switched it up, I'm like
Man this bitch might be a love song
So many miles away (Miles away)

[Trina:]
(Trina)
We been fuckin' round for a minute
And I fuck you so one hundred
But you know you miss this pussy
Distant runner, why you runnin'
You act funny but it could be all gone (All gone, all gone)
And if I breathe up on that dick, with them boxers on
That dick gon' be all gone

You wanna take me out (Fuck me down)
Buy me bags (Fuck me down)
Throw me stacks (Fuck me down)
[?] trips, where's the ring (I'll be your queen)

You wanna take me out (Fuck me down)
Buy me bags (Fuck me down)
Throw me stacks (Fuck me down)
[?] trips, where's the ring (And you'll be my king)

Callin' me zaddy
It's kinda hard to keep my mind off
Your lovin' never gets old
It's kinda hard to keep my hands off

Pussy wet in a whip, then we slide through the city
In the backseat, slide up the crop top
Suck a boss dick in a drop top
Well you suck a boss dick in a drop top
She a-suck a boss dick in a drop top
