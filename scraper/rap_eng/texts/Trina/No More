What the use of the back rub, and everything that I do that you ask for
If I could make you feel better I don’t pass up
And now you gotta get gone
I done spent a lot of nights trying to make it all right
Up on cloud 9 i was on those flights
You should've told me that you had a little fear of heights
Before I were to think that you and me could have a life
Created me a monster, yes i admit
Stayed with you wen i found out about the chick
I should have left then but I’m gonna leave now
You ain’t stepping up so I gotta step down
You gotta understand my position
Keep talkin so you can’t listen
You done up'd and made it all different
When you was close it still felt distant

So I’m gonna step down, it’s only right baby
I gotta step down, cause I’m the kind of lady
And I ain’t in the business trying to keep no dude
That ain’t trying to be kept
No, no, beating the hell out of a dead horse, out of a dead horse
Now we ain’t working no more
Beating the hell out of a dead horse, out of a dead horse
It ain’t working no more
I’m so tired, so damn tired
Beating the hell out of a dead horse
Beating the hell out of a dead horse
It ain’t working no more

We was making love like all day
Then I guess it all just changed
How you say that you ain't know a thang
After all the times I complained
You said you was thinking bout a ring
And I was dumb enough to believe
Putting all this stress on me, look all this I don’t need
So I guess I have to proceed
Instead of us I’ma do me
It’s time for me to break free
You and me together just can’t be

So I’m gonna step down, it’s only right baby
I gotta step down, cause I’m the kind of lady
And I ain’t in the business creating no wish list
They ain’t even realistic
Beating the hell out of a dead horse, out of a dead horse
Beating the hell out of a dead horse, out of a dead horse
It ain’t working no more
I’m so tired, so damn tired
Beating the hell out of a dead horse
Beating the hell out of a dead horse
It ain’t working no more

This love seems quite unfamiliar
Words mean nothing if I can’t feel 'em
Beating the hell out of a dead horse
Beating the hell out of a dead horse
Yeah, boy you crazy, you got this twisted
This good loving that you gon miss it
Beating the hell out of a dead horse
Beating the hell out of a dead horse
It ain’t working no more, more
