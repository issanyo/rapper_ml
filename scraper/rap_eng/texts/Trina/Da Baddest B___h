Who's bad? Who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's bad?
Wait hold up, who's bad?

I'm representin' for the bitches all eyes on your riches
No time for the little dicks you see the bigger the dick
The bigger the bank, the bigger the Benz
The better the chance to get close to his rich friends

I'm going after the big man, G-string make his dick stand
Make it quick then slow head by the night stand
Like lightning I wanna nigga with a wedding ring
Bank accounts in the Philippines blank note to take everything

See I fuck him in the living room
While his children ain't home
I make him eat it while my period on
A little nasty ho, red-bone but a classy ho

Young jazzy ho and don't be scared
If you're curious just ask me hoes
And yes dick sucking comes quite natural
I'm da baddest bitch what

Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Shit I'm the baddest bitch
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?

See I hate hoes who take their niggas
On talk shows and for hoes, y'all sold fool
See if I'm ever crossed or ever caught up in the cross
And if it's your fault ho, I'm going off ho
See I'm unemployed with no boss ho
While y'all sucking dick for free I'm broke off ho
See it pays to be the boss ho

Shit that's how you floss hoes X-rated elevated, buck naked
And I'd probably fuck your daddy
If your mammie wasn't playa hatin'
'Cause I'm da baddest bitch, I'm da baddest bitch what

Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Shit I'm the baddest bitch
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?

Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Shit I'm the baddest bitch
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?

I got game for young hoes
Don't grow to be a dumb hoe, that's a no no
See if you off the chains
Stay ahead of the game, save up buy a condo

Sell the pussy by the grands and in months you own a Benz
Another week a set of rims
See if I had the chance to be a virgin again
I'd be fucking by the time I'm ten

See off glass is my motto, dick suckin' in the auto
Quick fuckin' 'bout to follow
On the back of the truck
Or when I'm dead ass drunk but I don't get high though

I never took it up the ass often tried but I pass
And from what I heard it ain't bad
I'm a curious bitch who took off to get broke off
From the baby's dad 'cause I'm da baddest bitch

Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Shit I'm the baddest bitch
Who's bad?

Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
(Shit I'm the baddest bitch)
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's bad?

Shit I'm the baddest bitch
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
That's right I'm the baddest bitch, who's bad?
