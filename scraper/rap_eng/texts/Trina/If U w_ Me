[Chorus]
If you with me girlfriend then wave your hands
Slap a nigga with a hundred just to show your grand
Get them niggas for all you can
I'm gettin' paid yellin' fuck a man

[Verse 1]
I'm a bad ass bitch nigga
That's why yo' doe gone
And all yo' weed in the ozone
I'm doing this one for my no thugs
Who on no drugs
Other niggas yellin' out so what, huh
Cause you could never be my only one
Cause I want too much shit, want too much done
Recognize who I be when you see me in the club
Like a pooch in a coupe with the roof dropped down
Where my real bitches at?
Right here
Where them niggas riches at?
Right here
We treatin' niggas like rental cars doggin' em out
With no doe theres nothing we can talk about

[Chorus]
If you with me girlfriend then wave your hands
Slap a nigga with a hundred just to show your grand
Get them niggas for all you can
I'm gettin' paid yellin' fuck a man
If you with me girlfriend then wave your hands
Slap a nigga with a hundred just to show your grand
Get them niggas for all you can
I'm gettin' paid yellin' fuck a man

[Verse 2]
I can tell by your eyes, lust is what you feel
You wanna talk nigga, then lets discuss my bills
As you can see I'm an expensive bitch
Who has good taste and love expensive shit
You wanna conversate well nigga I charge a fee
Each additional minute, nigga I charge a fee
Where my money at - you short, I gots to go
Only ballers are tall enough to reach my goal
I know you love me but I love your huns
Cause you could never be my only one
Don't trust me, broke nigga don't lust me
Cause gettin' paid is a must be
And hell naw you can't fuck me

[Chorus]
If you with me girlfriend then wave your hands
Slap a nigga with a hundred just to show your grand
Get them niggas for all you can
I'm gettin' paid yellin' fuck a man
If you with me girlfriend then wave your hands
Slap a nigga with a hundred just to show your grand
Get them niggas for all you can
I'm gettin' paid yellin' fuck a man

[Verse 3]
2 karats in the ear
4 karats in the ring
Hoes get sick when they see the bling bling
Stay fuckin' wit' a thug
That'll pop the 4, cop some raw
Then cruize and just drop you off
You want me to lock my door (jaw?)
I'm not you're whore
Fuck nigga get your mind right or I'm out the door
Gotta go, gotta go
6 double o
I'm a big trouble ho
That likes to smuggle doe
From my head to my toe
Fly shit fo' sho'
Want my wrist to glow
And my tips to flow
Don't puff blunts
I like my B's up front
You can smoke though, blow weed up my cunt
Cause I'm a bad bitch
First round draft pick
Shaped like a coka- cola classic
Get my ass licked
Take a nigga for his cash quick
Even take plastic, uh

[Chorus]
If you with me girlfriend then wave your hands
Slap a nigga with a hundred just to show your grand
Get them niggas for all you can
I'm gettin' paid yellin' fuck a man

[Outro]
Yeah I know yall niggas can say fuck them hoes
But not on this one
I'm doing this one for my bitches
All bitches of all bitches
And fuck them flaw bitches
Okay, play wit' it
