Half dead
Half women, half men

Mouth smellin' like ass, dick, shit, and through up
Hold up

About them raga-dee bitchs cuz I'm sick of them
Home-hoes like Trina going to save your ass
But you a grown ass women bitch baze your ass!

You got big bucks?
You like the trick bucks?
You lookin' for a quick nut and a dick suck?
Nigga please
I been touchin' dem Bees
And I ain't stuck on my knees
For no couple of Gz
This game ain't nothin' to me
Got niggas stuntin' for me
From the N.Y.C to the Florida keys cuz
Lil' momma I'm real one
Pussy worth a trillion
Pull them V's out nigga stop pillion
Now you still wanna fuck I don't think so
I ain't no corduroy bitch I'm a mink coat

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3: Trina]
Ah! You wanna cheap fuck
Find a cheap hoe for that
You got 10 Gz it takes much more for that
You got 30 grand add 15
I'll pull out the handcuffs and the wiped cream
Cherry's and strawberries we could do big things
Pull the camera out play it on the big screen
Lick your lips you know this pussy taste real great
The realist one, I'm tryin to get it like Kim Gates

[Trick Daddy]
Can't no bitch come between me, my flow, my clique
Hoes we pimps we ain't pimpin' dicks
And after we fuck you ganna remember this
Wants some up, bling, bald head bitch
I be damned if I pimp ya'll hoes
I'll damage ya'll scandales ass, amateur ass hoes
One pound of cock and one genseen
A fifth of Gen, and bitch and let the beatin begin
I'm your daddy hoe
And bitch I drive a Chevey not a caddie hoe
The king dig-a-ling that is
You cheap bragin' about the head
I wanna see how mean that is

[Chorus 1]
