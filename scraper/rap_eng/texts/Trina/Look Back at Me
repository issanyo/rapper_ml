[Verse 1: Trina]
I got an ass so big like the sun
Hope you got a mile for a dick I wanna run
Slap it in my face, shove it down my throat
Nigga, where your blunt? I can make this pussy smoke
I know how to fuck, I know how to ride
I can spin around and keep the dick still inside
Now your mouth wide, you looking real scared
I'm a maneater, headhunter, I'm prepared

[Spoken Break: Trina]
Yeah, you running now. You running. I'ma put this pussy on you just like this

[Verse 1 Cont.: Trina]
Put this pussy in your jaws now, smack
Like it's Thanksgiving and it ain't coming back
Collard greens neckbones, nigga chew this ass
Both hold inspections don't stop till it pass
Licky licky licky licky licky for an hour
I'ma make it rain for you, here's a golden shower
Smell it like a flower, my pussy is a rose
Come a little closer, I wanna fuck your nose

[Pre-Hook: [?]]
If you want it, you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it
Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict

[Hook: [?] & Killer Mike]
Look back at me, look back at me
Look back at me, look back at me, girl
Look back at me, look back at me
Look back at me, look back at me, girl
Look back at me, girl
Look back at me, girl
Look back at me, girl
This your boy Killer kid from the ville, man

[Post-Hook: [?]]
If you want it, you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it
Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Thoroughbred red broad in my bed
Up all night, took pipe, gave head
Ass like Trina, face like Mya
Shot it on her chest, she said "Daddy aim higher"
Put jimmy on her titties and I bust off wicked
Gave her mayonaise on the face, pearl necklace
We turned the camera on and we did a sex scene
She call me R. Kelly and I call her...

[Spoken Break: Killer Mike]
That's my bitch right there, nigga

[Verse 2 Cont.: Killer Mike]
Hand full of ass and a fist full of weave
Ass in the air, face down on your knees
I'm a beast when I fuck I'ma put it on your gut
I'ma have you saying "No, please let me get up"
I'ma make you say "That's the spot, don't take it out"
I'm feeling like Akinyele, put it in your mouth
Kanye tell them gold digging hoes that we pimping in the South
And it ain't payday unless nuts in your mouth

[Pre-Hook: [?]]
If you want it, you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it
Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict

[Hook: [?] & Killer Mike]
Look back at me, look back at me
Look back at me, look back at me, girl
Look back at me, look back at me
Look back at me, look back at me, girl
Look back at me, girl
Look back at me, girl
Look back at me, girl

[Bridge: [?]]
Back it up, drop down to your knees
Bring it up real slow, make one cheek freeze
Back it up, drop down to your knees
Bring it up real slow, make one cheek freeze

[Post-Hook: [?]]
If you want it, you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it
Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict

[Verse 3: Trina]
Look look look look back at you for what?
I'm trying to concentrate on busting me a nut
I'm thinking about Trav, I'm thinking about Bo
Little dick nigga shit, hurry up I gotta go
Since they in prison pussy nigga make me know
That you ain't a virgin and you done this before
Fuck me till you can't breath, till you stomach scream help
It's your lucky day, all the lifeguards left

[Spoken Break: Trina]
Little dick ass nigga. You better get your face down here. Eat this pussy

[Verse 3 Cont.: Trina]
Dribble these titties on your lips
While you're doing that put your hand around my hips
Bounce me like a ball, slam me like K-ma
On and off the dick better known for breaking hearts
Nigga call a cab, I'm finna pack my shit and leave
Shouldn't have let you fuck, now that's some shit I can't believe
Wasting my time fucking all off beat
Pussy nigga next time when you see me don't speak

[Pre-Hook: [?]]
If you want it, you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it
