Ooh, I really didn't wanna  say this
But yall niggas be on that bullshit
Hyping on these fake bitches
When you really want you a real chick

And you wonder why she can't be loyal
(These hoes ain't loyal)
Cause she ain't the one that you should spoil
And also go ahead, blame your self
And all my real chicks
Leave these fuck boys on the shelf

[Chorus]
Let them chase the money, cars and hoes on their own
Let them keeping wondering why we won't come home
Cause we ain't got no time for that
Only miss a good thing when its gone
If you take him back
Keep him if he knows when he was wrong
Till then, till then
We will let them figure this thing out
On their own, hey, hey!

Now hes always talking about his niggas
Ooh, like, fuck these girls, I love my niggas
Now what Im supposed to think or say?
Especially when most of them be going both ways?
So whats a girl supposed to wanna come home to
When he acts like a woman when he is not into?
Oh, you about to have me risk my health
Since these niggas is pussy, tell them, go and fuck themselves

[Chorus]
Let them chase the money, cars and hoes on their own
Let them keep them wondering why we won't come home
Cause we ain't got no time for that
Only miss a good thing when its gone
If you take him back
Keep him if he knows when he was wrong
Till then, till then
We will let them figure this thing out
On their own, hey, hey!

Yeah, Trina, Trina
All I really wanted was the respect
Didn't wanna feel like a reject
Got way too many niggas on my left for that BS (that BS)!
I had to go through shit time after time
Putting shit together like a mastermind
You stepped out, so I stepped on
No pasta piatty, feel slipped on!
Left the house, but I kept the stones
Number changed, but I kept the phone
Just know that I still fly private
Still cool with my pilot
Know that if you ever got in trouble, trouble
Ill be there on a double, double
Know we could never be a couple
But the true fact is I still love you!
Count down!

[Chorus]
Let them chase the money, cars and hoes on their own
Let them keeping wondering why we won't come home
Cause we ain't got no time for that
Only miss a good thing when its gone!
If you take him back
Keep him if he knows when he was wrong
Till then, till then
We will let him figure this thing out
On their own, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey
