Yeah, I’ve come too far, to turn back now
Yeah, I’ve come too far, to turn back now
Trina
I’m too far, 305, to turn back now, yeah, aha
But I don’t know, I’ve come too far, I’ve come too far yeah, too far
Don’t know how yeah

Giuseppe's never looked so nice on a queen
The ghost pod’s reflection, the hairy glisten bling
Standing ovations and the sold out show days
I’ve been winning since recording a dat tapes
So what a bitch hate, that’s what they made for
And I’m the competition I’m what they can’t fuck
Prolific, profound and gifted, I don’t hear these bitches
Bopping so I don’t get tempted
In my own lane and a queen till the death of me
The bitches claim they bad but the only thing bad is me
Stirred up, body chemist cooking chemistry
I can’t be duplicated so they all choose to follow me
These birds are pictures of trash and fire and when my pen
Losses ink, that’s the day I retire, I never expire
I pray to a God that’s higher, he promised me a long time
He give me all I desire

I’m too far, to turn back now
You know I’d reach the peak
But I don’t know how
I’m too far, to turn back now
You know I’d reach the peak
But I don’t know how

I’m sitting on airplanes/spaceships
I’m an astronaut, with real curf tips
Million dollar whips, I take space trips
I sip starbucks and spend space chips
I play 50 cent moka I’m on vh1
Now tell me something that a bitch done that I ain’t done
To not be feeling left out like I am the one
Fuck an award, it’s political
I’ve been hot as the sun
I’ve been getting to the money like it’s nothing
I’ve been rocking Chanel no per diem no budget
I’m on my own shit and you hoes no money
I can’t take you under cause you thirst for the money
Bitches never had nothing till the game gave it to em
And now they getting money, look how the game do them
In my own lane and a queen till the death of me
The bitches claim they bad but the only thing bad is me

[Hook]
I’m too far, to turn back now
I reached the peak
But I don’t know how
I’m too far, to turn back now
I reached the peak
But I don’t know how

If you was thinking that it was over
Leprechaun, here’s my 4 leaf clover
But I don’t need luck, I’ve been prayed up
While they was sleeping, I’m the same bitch who stayed up
While I’m most consistent, why the rockstars love me
Why I’m on my 6th album, why your man wanna fuck me
Why the movie screen calling, why I ain’t stop balling
Why you throwing sneak disses if I really ain’t the target
Why they throw me on the cover, why my ass so fat
Yeah my ass is a movie, you should see it from the back
And it’s hd, high definition
If I never started rapping, all this ass you’d be missing
You’d be in the same position, listening to corny bitches
All the lies that they telling and the fantasies they wishing
In my own lane and a queen till the death of me
The bitches claim they bad but the only thing bad is me

[Hook]
I’m too far, to turn back now
I reached the peak
But I don’t know how
I’m too far, to turn back now
I reached the peak
But I don’t know how
