[Hook]
You might be crazy but I love it
Showin' off in public 'cause you drunk
Bae, why you trippin'?
If I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
And if I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
I'ma hold you down, down

[Verse 1]
This is the last time we gon' talk about it
When I say that I'm loyal, you should never doubt it
Take your sheets off the troop, pull back the covers
Yeah, it's been a few who claim to be lovers
But uh, the truth it, I'm kinda done with it
Give a nigga your all and put your heart in it
Get hooked to the dick, be a star with it
Now the house up in flames, I threw a match in it
I'ma play my part, see the script is written
Just let me be the only bad bitch who hittin'
Shot gun position, I gree on every decision
Never let us outside, throw us off the mission
If you see this vision, we can go real far
Further than the moon, I can be your superstar
I tried to tell these niggas, I'm the truth from the start
But they don't seem to get their part

[Hook]
You might be crazy but I love it
Showin' off in public 'cause you drunk
Bae, why you trippin'?
If I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
And if I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
I'ma hold you down, down

[Verse 2]
Ain't no bitch better, please
They all steal pieces for me, I'm the wet dream
What every man need, the viewers' choice, that's me
What you confused 'bout? What you need?
All and all, I'm a work in progress
So I never thought you, I can hand you off
Just prepare for everythin', steal the fortress
See I got you nigga, just don't make me regret
Opened up my heart for you, nigga
Let's get money, invest, make figures
Sail the ocean on yachts and shit, TMZ's tellin' lies
Let 'em snap a pic, so unfortunate
That they with you, knowin' me
We laugh at the bullshit, we one team
I tried to tell these niggas, I'm the truth from the start
But they don't seem to get their part

[Hook]
You might be crazy but I love it
Showin' off in public 'cause you drunk
Bae, why you trippin'?
If I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
And if I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
I'ma hold you down, down
You might be crazy but I love it
Showin' off in public 'cause you drunk
Bae, why you trippin'?
If I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
And if I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
I'ma hold you down, down

[Verse 3]
Opened up my heart for you, nigga
Let's get money, invest, make figures
Sail the ocean on yachts and shit, TMZ's tellin' lies
Let 'em snap a pic, so unfortunate
That they with you, knowin' me
We laugh at the bullshit, we one team
I tried to tell these niggas, I'm the truth from the start
But they don't seem to get their part

[Hook]
You might be crazy but I love it
Showin' off in public 'cause you drunk
Bae, why you trippin'?
If I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
And if I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
I'ma hold you down, down
