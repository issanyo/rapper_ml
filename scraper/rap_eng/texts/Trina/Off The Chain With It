What time ya'll?? Ball off tha chain
(Trick Daddy)

(CHORUS- 2x)
You off tha chain wit it
You do your thang wit it
Tha way you talk, tha way you walkin
You on tha road lil' momma
Girl you slang wit it
Outta control lil' momma
Never know dis b'4, but damn you swole lil momma

(VERSE 1: Trina)
Like I said before, you don't nann hoe

Who off tha chain like me, you understand hoe?
I got tha niggas at me, I got tha bitches at me
Slow your roll hoe, Lil' Momma strictly dick
I'm the bitch that got you lame hoes poppin shit
At the shows dyke hoes blowin kisses at me

Lil' Momma gettin' plenty g's and I got 'em hollerin

(CHORUS 2x)

(VERSE 2: Trina)
Ain't no secret baby
You know lil' momma shinin'
BB studded, diamond's got these big ballers whinin'
Nigga let them g's loose
You know lil' momma play
Or rob that bank playboy
Peel them g's loose
You know lil' momma baddest bitch on tha south coast
I got these buck niggas trickin' of their house note

(CHORUS- 2x)
Pretty face, slim waist, phat ass wit it

(VERSE 3: Trick Daddy)
You off tha chain wit it, ha, off tha chain wit it
See i can tell by your smile

Girl you got your freak game on
Got on these strap up heels, and your P thangs on
You got your hair all done
You off tha chain wit it
Somebody ta watch your son
You slang your than you makin change wit it
For a lil cash

For a lil' this
For a lil that
Letme make this

Flirtin' all week long
I'll be rememberin' your walls

(CHORUS-1x)

Uh, now i'm makin' hits again
Last year ya'll remember how i came wit it
Got you hatin' hoes sick again
