Who is Trina? I'm sure that's not the only question you want answered
Do you really wanna know what hard work is? Ask me and I'll tell you
From nothing to something
If there is a will there is a way
Traveling city to city, state to state
Non stop shows, interviews all over the globe
I am Miami
Magazine covers, gossips number 1 topic
The life of the rich and famous
Fans who can relate, from the beginning till now
Trashy mouth, too sophisticated lady
Not just a rapper but a businesswoman still standing
When I've seen others come and go, I rise
Grateful for my struggles and the road that I took
It only made me stronger, it prepared me for this
For the here and now, focused and eager to learn
Fast to teach, this is not a game
This is my life
Fairy tales don't exist over here, I'm a realist
And strong is just another statement to describe me
And now I ask you the same question again
Who is Trina? [laughs] She is amazing
I'm amazin', so amazin'
I'm amazin', I'm amazin'
I'm amazin', I'm amazin'
I'm a...

I'm a first round pick, yup, the lucky lotto numbers 777
The haters could never take me under promise if I fall, won't be down to long
Your psychic is wrong, tell that chick I sang this song
I own the throne, any other chick she follow
I'm her role model, I don't use a bottle
I breast feed the game like there's tomorrow
I can tell you about pain and talk about sorrow
Bitches ain't shit and niggas ain't either
Niggas want ya chick, better watch the way you treat her
You shouldn't have to beat her
Lose her the way you meet her
When a woman's fed up, better watch the way you treat her
I'm way past a diva, I'm outta ya league
I'm something ya need, I'm front page, something to read
I said I'm way past a diva, I'm outta ya league
I'm something ya need, a front page, something to read

This is the life and I wanna welcome you too
Amazin', amazin' [laughs]
I'm amazin', I'm amazin', I'm amazin'
And I'm back, and I'm back, and I'm back
And I'm back, said I'm back
Just like that
