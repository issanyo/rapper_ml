(Let them hoes die)
Stop stressin' on me for the attention
(Let them hoes fight)
You're excused, you're no competition
(Let them hoes die)
Stop comin' at me, guns are a blazin'
(Let them hoes fight)
Hold up bitch, I could stomp your face in

I was lookin' hella good
When I stepped off in the club
She was jockin' on my Gucci
'Cause her boyfriend want my cookie
She just keep on lookin' back
I keep throwin' her the bird
I'm about to walk away
I don't care what you heard

Watch me, watch me swing my weave
I'm gon', I'm gon' fix my lip gloss
I'm gon' stunt on them hoes
With my hands up on my hip bones singin'
Jealous bitches, jealous bitches
Don't hate me, don't hate me

(Let them hoes die)
Stop stressin' on me for the attention
(Let them hoes fight)
You're excused, you're no competition
(Let them hoes die)
Stop comin' at me, guns are a blazin'
(Let them hoes fight)
Hold up bitch, I could stomp your face in
(Let them hoes die)
Stop stressin' on me for the attention
(Let them hoes fight)
You're excused, you're no competition
(Let them hoes die)
Stop comin' at me, guns are a blazin'
(Let them hoes fight)
Hold up bitch, I could stomp your face in

He keep giving me the look
Like he wanna make me holla
I feel like I'm in the club

'Cause he throwin' me them dollas
He keeps sendin' me these drinks
'Cause you lookin' like his grandma

I got, got, got it
Pathetic if you're knowin' this is drama

Watch me, watch me swing my weave
I'm gon', I'm gon' fix my lip gloss
I'm gon' stunt on them hoes
With my hands up on my hip bones singin'
Jealous bitches, jealous bitches
Don't hate me, don't hate me

(Let them hoes die)
Stop stressin' on me for the attention
(Let them hoes fight)
You're excused, you're no competition
(Let them hoes die)
Stop comin' at me, guns are a blazin'
(Let them hoes fight)
Hold up bitch, I could stomp your face in

Let them hoes fight
Let them hoes fight
Let them hoes fight

(Let them hoes die)
Stop stressin' on me for the attention
(Let them hoes fight)
You're excused, you're no competition
(Let them hoes die)
Stop comin' at me, guns are a blazin'

Hold up bitch, I could stomp your face in

Let them hoes fight
