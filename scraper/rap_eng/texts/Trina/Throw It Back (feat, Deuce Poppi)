Gimme the cheese and the keys to yo' Maybach
You wanna touch for free, I don't play dat
And if your money ain't right, nigga stay back
You better think twice, I like pink ice
Louis Vuitton boots with the mink tights
I ain't no cheap, chick you gotta throw it back
We gotta go to the mall boy and blow some stacks
And I ain't no gold digger
But you fin' to pay for this car note nigga
You gotta pay to play, everybody's ain't able
Damn, be a man, bring somethin' to the table

Give it to me, let me see you drop it fast
Girl we could go to Phipps pass and get to poppin' tags
Or we could ball through the mall, tear shoppin' bags
And take you straight to the tail so I could chop that ass
Uh, you wanna ride, we could swerve in the Vette
I'll fuck you from the back done pinched yo' nerve and yo' neck
That pussy so good you deserve you a check
You want that ice on your hands with the birds 'round your neck
Uh, but I ain't no trickin' nigga
I'm a trap cook crack up in the kitchen nigga
But I will lay pipe 'til that coochie dead
Nigga squirtin' on curtains and Gucci spreads
If I give it to you daddy would you throw it back?
If I give it to you daddy would you throw it back?
If I give it to you daddy would you throw it back
Throw it back, throw, throw it back?

Throw it back, throw, throw it back?
Throw it back, throw, throw it back
I need a, sugar daddy baller
That go to Belle Harbor and tear the mall up
Uh, I need a D to call up
To break me off and tear these sugar walls up
Heidi Floess is what they call her
I'm on the private jet and I'm alcoholed up
Miss Trina, a star is born
Spoiled and rich, a ghetto Kelly Osbourne
You know I'm in demand, you see me in Japan
I'm leanin' on your man, my jeans worth a grand
I'm still the baddest and you knowin' that
And if I, give it to you would you throw it back?
If I give it to you daddy would you throw it back?
If I give it to you daddy would you throw it back?
If I give it to you daddy would you throw it back
Throw it back, throw, throw it back?
