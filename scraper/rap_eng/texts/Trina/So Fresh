[Intro: Plies & Trina]
(Uh huh)
Unusual suspects (yeah, yeah)
But I know these niggas, man (that's right)
Jim Johnson and Bigg D  (yeah)
Ay, this Trina and Plies, a Slip-n-Slide thing
I'm in here with the Baddest Bitch (trust two)
Ay, Trina, take care of these hoes 'cause I got these niggas  (that's right)

[Chorus: Trina & Plies]
My steering wheel wood and my wheels chrome
Can't pay these niggas to leave me alone
I'm, I'm so fresh (yeah)
I'm, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm so fresh (yeah)
I got a pocket full of money and my teeth glitter
Something about being a trill ass nigga
I'm so fresh (yeah)
I'm so fresh (yeah)

[Verse 1: Trina]
Paint candy, racing strips
Crushed them bitches off the rip
I don't think you really wanna mess with me
Test me and eventually
See me speeding, cops don't see them
Fuck them and feed them, wouldn't wanna be them
I ain't scared of y'all
I ain't no regular broad, I ain't scared at all
Like Bone Crusher, I'll crush your bones
When I come through strong with my big big brone
Riding spinners like Three 6 do
Let me do me, nigga, you do you
Suck this clit till my shit turn blue
Put a bitch to sleep, wake me up when you're through
I'ma get dressed so fresh, looking new
And it's back to the Chevy or the cab for you
Chucking deuces, switching lanes
Riding that donk and sitting on things
You ain't never ever met a bitch like me
And your bitch ain't never ride a dick like me
Check the paint, watch the feet
Inches 26's deep
Candy dripping on the street
Bitch, I'm riding B-I-G

[Chorus: Trina & Plies]
My steering wheel wood and my wheels chrome
Can't pay these niggas to leave me alone (yeah)
I'm, I'm so fresh (yeah)
I'm, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm so fresh
I got a pocket full of money and my teeth glitter
Something about being a trill ass nigga (yeah)
I'm so fresh (yeah)
I'm so fresh

[Verse 2: Plies]
It ain't too many niggas like me, I'm from a rare breed
I walk it like I talk it, was raised by a G
You supposed to like me, dog, 'cause I'm what you wanna be
From top to bottom, being trill that's something that's in me
It's a hell of a feeling to know you a 100% real nigga
I've been out here getting money since I was a little nigga
I'm loved by these hoes, respected by these killers
It took years of thugging to get to this point, nigga
I don't know if you know how it feels to walk around with stacks
I've been broke and came up and I ain't going back
'Cause money get you friends, choppers get you respect
Respect out here in these streets, I got a lot of that

[Chorus: Trina & Plies]
My steering wheel wood and my wheels chrome
Can't pay these niggas to leave me alone
I'm, I'm so fresh (yeah)
I'm, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm so fresh (yeah)
I got a pocket full of money and my teeth glitter
Something about being a trill ass nigga
I'm so fresh (yeah)
I'm so fresh (yeah)

[Interlude: Plies & Trina]
Damn, boy
This a $50,000 motherfucking track right here, boy (50 motherfucking stacks, man)
Yeah, yeah
Ay, this a big motherfucking thing, boy
Unusual suspects, dog (I don't know if the fans listening)
That's right
Plies in here, nigga, the trillest nigga in this shit
And Trina, the Baddest Bitch, please believe it
Y'all niggas know how I get down

[Chorus: Trina & Plies]
My steering wheel wood and my wheels chrome
Can't pay these niggas to leave me alone
I'm, I'm so fresh (yeah)
I'm, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm so fresh (yeah)
I got a pocket full of money and my teeth glitter
Something about being a trill ass nigga
I'm so fresh (yeah)
I'm so fresh (yeah)
