[Verse 1: J-Shin]
You're the finest bitch I've ever seen (That's right)
Looking like a ghetto queen (ghetto queen)
So call it ghetto fabulous (fabulous)
She the type of bitch I wanna bust
Said baby can I drop this please? (drop it)
In the tail from the back while smokin' trees
Hey sexy mama, playful eyes
Just tell me can you freak me right?

[Verse 2: Trina]
Yo, yo, uh Miss Trina Z3 Beamer
Open up my legs put your head in between 'em
Till I bust like lead from a heater
Make sure you got bread for the diva
Leave a niggas pockets dry like the cleaners
Fly by with the shine bright gleamer
Flossin' with the lime Via Spigas
Make it hurt with the H-Class pieces
I take back shots, take back shots
Get a nigga for his cake and rocks
Positions that you've never even heard before
Twist around, ride a dick vertical, uh
Fine, looky here where the long dick niggas at?
Where them six figure stacks and the fifties at?
You're the average bitch, I got carats bitch
Hot with a ho cause I'm da baddest bitch

[Bridge: J-Shin]
I got 69 ways to make you come my way
Those other bitches don't play
I do it 69 ways
I wanna get down with her
(Down with her)
I wanna get down with her
(Down with her)

[Verse 3: Trina]
Ghetto superstar
Niggas eat the pussy like a sushi bar
Never let a nigga hit the koochie raw
Might bust a nut on my Gucci bra
I guess you think you fuckin' with a hoochie huh?
Fat pussy lookin' juicy huh?
In this two piece Coogi huh?
You got twenty grand you can screw me huh?
Got a hundred grand we can make a movie huh?
I know you sick with me
Cause your baby daddy trick with me
Cop rocks at Tiffany's
I make him fuck 'til his back stiff
Hid the stash in the mattress so I can shop at Sax Fifth
Fuck a nigga just for practice
Fake a nut like an actress, give a fake address
Milk a nigga like a fat breast
Till there ain't no cash left
Shit, I'm a bad bitch!

[Verse 4: J-Shin]
You're the finest bitch I've ever seen (That's right)
Looking like a ghetto queen (ghetto queen)
So call it ghetto fabulous (fabulous)
She the type of bitch I wanna bust
Said baby can I drop this please? (drop it)
In the tail from the back while smokin' trees
Hey sexy mama, playful eyes
