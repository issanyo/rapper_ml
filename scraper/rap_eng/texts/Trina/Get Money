[Intro]
Ohh
Trina
Ohh

[Verse 1]
'Cause me I'm trying not to trip
Trying not to trip
Can't let that jealousy get the best of me
Gotta keep my mind on the chip
Money on my mind, money on my mind
That gossip won't get your stacks up
How you gon hustle blind?
'Cause I need fish tanks on my wall, hoe
Umbrella in my car door
Y'all mad but y'all broke
So what the fuck I'm worrying bout y'all for?
Got new checks and new stress
Yeah, I know it come with that
So if a hoe leave, let her stay gone unless she bring them bogies back

[Chorus]
'Cause me I'm trying not to trip
Trying not to trip
Can't let that jealousy get the best of me
Gotta keep my mind on the chip
'Cause these hoes gon hate you anyway
They gon hate you anyway
Shit, either way it go
They gon have your business in the streets
You gon have some enemies
Even if you broke
Shit
Might as well get money
Might as well get money
They gon hate you anyway
Either way it go
Might as well get money

[Verse 2]
Ex-friend used to be my best friend
Now she run around with my ex-man
Me, I gotta blame myself
Should have never put this snake bitch on a jet, man
Showed the bitch how to dress
Gave the bitch clothes and look how it gets
Put her in a Rolls
She ain't never roll like this, when niggas will be getting the real checks
Sipping 'em gold bottles, with your role model
You look up to me bitch, you won't be getting no follows
You ain't got no hustle, you ain't even trying nothing
You trying to ride shotgun but I'm thinking 'bout buying one

[Chorus]
'Cause me I'm trying not to trip
Trying not to trip
Can't let that jealousy get the best of me
Gotta keep my mind on the chip
'Cause these hoes gon hate you anyway
They gon hate you anyway
Shit, either way it go
They gon have your business in the streets
You gon have some enemies
Even if you broke
Shit
Might as well get money
Might as well get money
They gon hate you anyway
Either way it go
Might as well get money
