[Intro: Trina (Lyfe Jennings)]
I'm just tryna make sure that you hear me out there
Now when you see the queen coming
And the horn start blowing
(Ay yoh Trina)
Everybody start running
People in the streets coming
(It's been a while baby
But they still gotta bow down to the queen, ha-ha yea)

[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings]
Now when you see the queen coming
And all the horns start blowing
Everybody start running
People in the streets coming
Make way, make way, make way
Make way, make way, make way
Make way whoaaaa

They see the fireworks blowing
And the roof start smoking
And you know it ain't a game
Recognize this woman, make way
Make way, make way, make way
Make way, make way, make way, way

[Verse 1: Trina]
Every time I turn the t.v. on, all I see is Trina
Everybody so quick to judge me
Look how you point the finger
Saying he's to good for me when you don't even know me
You're too lonely, you need to worry bout yours only
Like a rag you throw me
Some pretend they don't know me
BET you know you owe me, show me homie
Tryna steal my pride, they make me go harder
Do I worry? I don't bother
I'ma finish what I started
Working more than 9 to 5
Keeping the Slip-n-Slide dream alive
Look at some of these chicks that try
Half of them lost their flame, they died
While I been walking on fire
I'm yearning to go higher
Never kicked out the game, I shall retire
Now put that on The Wire
I grab the game like pliers
I'm doing the whole dash, staring like I'm wearing tires
Can't [?] studio to stage
My people gotta make way
For queen before I clear the streets

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Trina]
What makes you think this life more easier for me
If you can only see, it ain't all that is crack up to be
More money, more problems when you living like this
If you ain't making hits, then you ain't about shit
Fans go to talking, the neighbors go to shopping
Am I'm really human? [?] when I go to [?]
Huffin' an the puffin', tears start fallin'
The the whole turns cold
That's when you wanna pick your coffin
But I ain't giving up, I ain't never be a quiter
I go hard on everything, I'm a natural born winner
Natural born sinner but I'm praying for forgiveness
Some-times I pinch myself then I realize I live this
Some say relentless, I say forgiveness
That's when I pinch myself and than I realize I live this
Some say relentless, I say forgiveness
That's when I pinch myself and then I realize I live this

[Chorus]
