[Hook: Trina]
I'm supa bad and I got supa ass and I get supa cash
Got you supa mad, a bad bitch I am
I'm supa bad and I got supa ass and I get supa cash
Got you supa mad, a bad bitch I am

[Verse 1: Trina]
I'm supa bad, got a supa ass
Got you supa mad, jump with yo' stupid ass
Got a supa swag, kick you with a group of fags
Check ma' resume bitch, I get supa cash
Stupid techs, closet full of stupid bags
Fuck the superman, I'm looking for a stupid man
Who go ham in the mall with them rubber bands
And I'm the baddest bitch this fucker ever had
I got a supa crib ‘cause I got supa rib
Sit on the tip but a dick shifts supa gears
Five karats in the lobs, that's supa ears
Supa bitch get to lock ‘em, supa other year

[Verse 2: Nisha Rockstarr]
I'm supa high, I get supa fly
I go hard in the mall until I'm supa tired
See the rims on the Benz with these stupid tires
With the leather inside, that's a supa ride
I'm a supa freak, you a supa freak?
We're in the stupid suit, so you can supa freak
Baby let me see it, do I need a ruler?
I'm supa soaked wetter than a cooler
Don't let it fool you, kitty supa tired
Hit this stupid ride, call it a supa night
I've got the supa good, I keep it supa classy
I can get supa hood and get supa nasty

[Hook: Trina]
I'm supa bad and I got supa ass and I get supa cash
Got you supa mad, a bad bitch I am
I'm supa bad and I got supa ass and I get supa cash
Got you supa mad, a bad bitch I am
Bad, badder than a motherfucker
You know I'm badder than a motherfucker
You know I'm badder than a motherfucker
Child, please, super badder than a motherfucker

[Verse 3: Brianna]
Who wanna fuck with me?
Bad bitch, no issue
Got his hands on me one time, then two
Capio momento, still a scene clepto
Then wore a whole pink sick, pepto
Oh ‘scuse me, swinging from a G5, I call it the beehive
You dumb if you don't see why
Miss sting has seen what the fuck won't nobody smoking like hookah
I'm so glad, come on
I'm different, yeah, I'm different
Ma' shit don't stink, bet the side you link
Face B, you a hater, basic instinct
Supa bad like the movie, come watch me

[Hook: Trina]
