[Intro]
I used to (I used to)
I used to call you (I used to call you)
I used to call you on your cell phone (cell phone)

[Verse]
All these niggas the same
When a bossy bitch procrastinate and play games
You wanna call my phone on the late night
When you drunk as fuck? You lame
You in love with a stripper?
I'm in love with a clipper
You a brand new nigga
Got a couple dollars for a broad
And you spend her
Guess you the man
Walking 'round like Jigga
Bet you never found another bitch
That come close to this
Cause now I know where your focus is
I'm disconnecting this hopelessness
Remember I was the bitch you was striving with
All the accolades and the accomplishments
All the time and sweat that I invested in
Now you actin' like I'm some dusty chick
I'm hangin' up the line, click

[Bridge]
Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
All these bitches know and I feel left out
Boy, you tried to play me
Now you stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
I heard you fuckin' bitches, going out more
Throwin' all your money on the dance floor
Doin' all that shit I've never seen before
I used to call you on your cell phone
(laughter)
