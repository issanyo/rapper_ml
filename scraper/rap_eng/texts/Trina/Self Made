What you saying?

I'm not thirsty for a attention, I see you checking for
I'm not impressed 'cause I know what I'm worth
More than a stare or a flash of your keys
Best believe I can do my own thing

Solo in the whip see me drop to coupon it
Ask about me they K.Michelle be doing it
Face it, homie, I ain't never been basic
Shine like a light and my swag is amazing, oh

I do my own thang drive my range
Pay my own bills 'cause I got my own change
Ten stacks in my purse wrapped in rubber bands
In the club popping bottles 'cause I'm the man
I'm a self made chick
What cha saying? what cha saying?

A hundred on the wrist let me teach you a lesson
Nothing came easy to me I guess I'm blessed with
(The drive to go get it)
I be stutting like my daddy
And losing not an option I'm in it to win it

Never be a bust it, baby
Take it for what its worth still F you pay me
Hell yeah, I'm the man but I'm still that lady
And there's no way I'ma let you play me

I do my own thang drive my range
Pay my own bills 'cause I got my own change
Ten stacks in my purse wrapped in rubber bands
In the club popping bottles 'cause I'm the man
I'm a self made chick
What cha saying? what cha saying?

If you a self made chick who got hatas in the place
Look 'em dead in the face and say?
(I'm on it)
If you a self made chick who got these dudes on the chase
Look 'em dead in the face and say?
(I'm on it)
I'm on, I'm on, yep, I'm on
