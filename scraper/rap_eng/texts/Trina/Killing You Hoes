Ah ah ah yep yep yep

The baddest bitch is back
I'm back part 2, part 2
I'm reloaded and I'm killin you hoes

[Chorus: x2]
You see dat outfit bitch
I'm killin you hoes

Cute face and ass swoll
I'm killin you hoes

I got the best pussy out
I'm killin you hoes

And ain't non you can do about
I'm killin you hoes

I don't care what a bitch think or how a hoe feel
Cause ain't nann one of you hoes payin my bills
And ain't nann one of you hoes fina buy me a crib
And ain't nann one of you hoes fina get me a whip

I know I must make a lot of ya'll hoes sick
And all I can tell you hoes, get used to it bitch!

Cause Ms. Trina the baddest as it fuckin get
And I don't sweat niggas and I don't fight over dick

So while you fuckin for free, I'm tryna get rich
And don't you cross that line cause I get hot quick
And if you do it's gonna be me & u up in this bitch
And I'm gonna show you why they call me the baddest bitch

[Chorus x2]
You see dat outfit bitch (bitch)
And you know what it costs

Look at how my ass poke out when I walk
Cause your nigga wanna fuck me it ain't my fault
And my pussy sit up real nice in ma shorts

Hate or love it, cause you broke hoes gonna talk
And I can go in any club and shut that bitch down
And I can come to your city and make it my town
So when you see me hoe you better smile and don't frown

Cause I got a couple of my dawgs that ready to clamp
And you'd be best off sittin your tired ass down
And all you jealous ass hoes better move round
And ask these hoes in Dade how it gets down

[Chorus x2]
The topic of discussion, I can fuck whoever I want
Look at me bitch I got everything you hoes want
I can fuck a nigga in the Bentley or a nigga in the dump
You get your money in pieces I get mines in a lump

You only ballin on weekends
I'm ballin the whole month
I'm just a hood bitch
Rich suburbia cash
A little fly ass chick who got alota class

I wanna spend your money nigga and put mine in a stash
You got me fucked up cause Trina gonna have the last laugh
Get your hustling hoe, look like your doin bad

You lost alota weight shit, you fallin off fast
I feel sorry for ya' might let you borrow some ass

[Chorus x2]
