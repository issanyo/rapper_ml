[Trick Daddy]
What time ya’ll?? Ball off tha chain

[Chorus- 2x]
You off tha chain wit it
You do your thang wit it
Tha way you talk, tha way you walkin
Girl you slang wit it
You on tha road lil’ momma
Outta control lil’ momma
Never know dis b’4, but damn you swole lil momma

[VERSE 1: Trina]
Like I said before, you don’t nann hoe
Who off tha chain like me, you understand hoe?
I got tha niggas at me, I got tha bitches at me
At the shows dyke hoes blowin kisses at me
Slow your roll hoe, Lil’ Momma strictly dick
I’m the bitch that got you lame hoes poppin shit
I’m off tha glass, got these niggas trickin 20 G’s
Lil’ Momma gettin’ plenty g’s and I got ’em hollerin

[Chorus 2x]

[VERSE 2: Trina]
Ain’t no secret baby
You know lil’ momma shinin’
BB studded, diamond’s got these big ballers whinin’
You know lil’ momma play
Nigga let them g’s loose
Or rob that bank playboy
Peel them g’s loose
You know lil’ momma baddest bitch on tha south coast
I got these buck niggas trickin’ of their house note
Cuz i’m off tha glass wit it
I’m gettin’ cash with it
Pretty face, slim waist, phat ass wit it

[Chorus- 2x]

[VERSE 3: Trick Daddy]
You off tha chain wit it, ha, off tha chain wit it
Off tha chain wit it
See i can tell by your smile
Girl you got your freak game on
Got on these strap up heels, and your P thangs on
You got your hair all done
Somebody ta watch your son
You off tha chain wit it
You slang your than you makin change wit it
For a lil cash
For a lil ass
For a lil’ this
For a lil that
Letme make this
Letme take this
Letme get that

I’ll be up supportin’ your cause
Flirtin’ all week long
I’ll be rememberin’ your walls

[Chorus-1x]
[Trina]
Yeah I’m off tha chain wit it

Last year ya’ll remember how i came wit it
Uh, now i’m makin’ hits again

Got you hatin’ hoes sick again
And them niggas hollerin’

[Chorus – til end]
