Let them hoes fight
Stressin' on me for the attention
Let them hoes fight
'Cause you're no competition
Let them hoes fight
Comin' at me, guns are a blazin'
Let them hoes fight
I could stomp your face in
I was looking hella good
When I stepped off in the club
She was jockin' on my Gucci
'Cause her boyfriend want my cookies
She just keep on lookin' back
I keep throwin' her the bird
I'm about to walk away
I don't care what you heard
Watch me, watch me swing my weave
I'm gon', I'm gon' fix my lip gloss
I'm gon' stunt on them hoes
With my hands up on my hip bones singin'
Jealous bitches, jealous bitches
Don't hate me, don't hate me
Let them hoes fight
Stressin' on me for the attention
Let them hoes fight
'Cause you're no competition
Let them hoes fight
Comin' at me, guns are a blazin'
Let them hoes fight
I could stomp your face in
Let them hoes fight
Stressin' on me for the attention
Let them hoes fight
'Cause you're no competition
Let them hoes fight
Comin' at me, guns are a blazin'
Let them hoes fight
I could stomp your face in
He keep givin' me the look
Like he wanna make me holla
I feel like I'm in the club
'Cause he throwin' me them dollars
He keep sendin' me these drinks
'Cause you lookin' like his grandma
I got enough big baby here
Without the stress and drama
Watch me, watch me swing my weave
I'm gon', I'm gon' fix my lip gloss
I'm gon' stunt on them hoes
With my hands up on my hip bones singin'
Jealous bitches, jealous bitches
Don't hate me, don't hate me
Let them hoes fight
Stressin' on me for the attention
Let them hoes fight
'Cause you're no competition
Let them hoes fight
Comin' at me, guns are a blazin'
Let them hoes fight
I could stomp your face in
Let them hoes fight
Let them hoes fight
Let them hoes fight
Stressin' on me for the attention
Let them hoes fight
'Cause you're no competition
Let them hoes fight
Comin' at me, guns are a blazin'
Let them hoes fight
I could stomp your face in
Let them hoes fight
Stressin' on me for the attention
