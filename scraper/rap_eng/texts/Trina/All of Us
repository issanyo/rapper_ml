[Verse 1]:
Trina
When you stop playing games yeah we coming, we coming
Like a football field loud tucking and dumbing
Kicking up slides and shoes breaking all of the rules
Cause it ain’t no second guessing about who you gon choose
You got the baddest right ‘chea bring the cup june’s wit me
And my momma down to ride and she gotta swing for me
Can’t make these other broads feel they better than
Give em attention now they think they coming to the penthouse
He gon pull up to a house, tell a heffer come out
She had [?] a finger, she was poppin at the mouth
Now you acting you know what I’m talkin bout
I got the pictures, it was all in her mouth
No discussion, no more, it’s nothing
I don’t share my niggas, no weekend, no nothing
No weekend, the weekend

[Verse 2]:
Girl I think I might have found my husband, (we'll see)
It's the beginning and the ending, could be winning
Cause right now he got me blushing, (believe that)
He know how to keep the fire burning
Bitch he buy me roses by the dozen
And when he drop me off, it's no rushing, I love it
Get home and talk all night, yeah
Sex me when I FaceTime, oh

[Pre-Hook]:
I tell you what, he don't give up
He working on that diamond with them princess cuts
I feel my river, flowing and flowing
What I like about him most is he keep going and going
Introducing him today so
Let him see every face then
If he takes my heart and breaks it
Then I'm coming with my best friend and my mommy and my cousins

[Hook]:
Baby it's time to let you know, this ain't the typical
If we getting physical, better be ready cause
He gon have to deal with all of us then baby
He gon have to deal with all of us
Tell me if you ready, tell me if you
Tell me come and get me, oh I know
He gon have to deal with all of us then baby
He gon have to deal with all of us

[Verse 3]:
Ain't no faking, it's you, I'm hanging with you
I'm telling the truth, I'm taken
If the crush is a drug, I can't get enough
Keep it up, keep it up, don't ever lose
I can't get you off my mind
It ain't never ever felt so good
Maybe this can be the best all time
You give a feeling baby, I can't lie

[Pre-Hook]:
I tell you what, he don't give up
He working on that diamond with them princess cuts
I feel my river, flowing and flowing
What I like about him most is he keep going and going
Introducing him today so
Let him see every face then
If he takes my heart and breaks it
Then I'm coming with my best friend and my mommy and my cousins

[Hook]:
Baby it's time to let you know, this ain't the typical
If we getting physical, better be ready cause
He gon have to deal with all of us then baby
He gon have to deal with all of us
Tell me if you ready, tell me if you
Tell me come and get me, oh I know
He gon have to deal with all of us then baby
He gon have to deal with all of us

[Bridge]:
You don't really wanna fuck around
Ride through with that top down
We ain't give to you really now
Think about it, think about it
You don't really want that really now
We don't really mind getting down
Ain't ready to be my man
You better tell me now, tell me now
I'm with you, you with me
So let's just stay dreaming
No fighting, no cheating
My sisters come quickly
I'm with you, you with me
So let's just stay dreaming
No fighting, no cheating
My sisters come quickly, yeah

[Outro]:
I know, I know, I know

He gon have to deal with all of us
All of us
