[Mya]
(Verse 1)
It's been five hours since you left here, boy
Said you'd be 'round the block
Had to make a stop
So I kept your dinner hot
Hot
Hot
And I been waitin' for you ever since
It's three in the mornin', yeah

Hook: Mya
Cause three turns into four
And four turns into five
Then six was around, what you tryin' to do
Baby, make me cry
I don't what I did
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna find you

Chorus: Mya
I'm ridin', I'm ridin'
Past your mama's house
You got me ridin', I'm ridin'
Past your boy's house
You got me ridin', I'm ridin'
I'm ridin', tryin' to find you
Baby, you got me out here
Looking for you, right
I'm ridin', I'm ridin'
Past that bitches's house
You got me ridin', I'm ridin'
By all your ex's house
You got me ridin', I'm ridin'
I'm ridin', tryin' to find you
Baby, you got me out here
Looking for you, right

(Verse 2)
When you stepped to me
You had nothin'
But the shoes on your feet, and no place to sleep
So I let you lay your head on my pillow
You didn't have a dime, so I held you, fight your cryin'
It was just a waste of time
Then I played the fool for you
It's three in the mornin', yeah
It's not a weekend
Oh ho

Repeat Hook

Repeat Chorus

[Rap Verse: Trina]
Been ridin' all night, almost out of gas
Music turned off, prayin' that I don't crash
I was too damn good, you was tryin' to get dump
Flew planes on your crib, that's s'cuse what I've done
Sayin', "I'm sorry," cooked you hot plates
You was thinkin' with ya feet, she catched you out late
Let you say "What," no, don't say shit
Wanna bounce in here late, you can have that chick
Have these pictures, have these clothes
Bet, next time you see me, a whole new wardrobe
Got a little style
Got buckwild
Stop feeling yourself
Go ahead, take a bow
With some white-tee thug, let you meet TNG
You got our respect and famous, cause of me
Boy, you a trip, now watch what I do
From this point on, don't wanna see you (You bitch)

Bridge: Mya
I was sippin' on Red Bull, so there ain't be no sleep tonight
Not gonna let you go
Oh no
Without a fight
See, you're the type to make, a girl gon' think she know ain't right
Five dollars of gas, and I'm drivin' fast
Where you at, where you at, where you at

Repeat Chorus

[Mya]
It's three in the morning
It's four in the morning
It's five in the morning
Where you at, where you at, where you at
It's three in the morning
It's four in the morning
It's five in the morning
Where you at, where you at, where you at
