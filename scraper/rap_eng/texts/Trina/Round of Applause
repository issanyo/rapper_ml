I'm radio city, racks I got plenty
You don't know a bad bitch like me it ain't many
I can pull up in the minnie with my skirt real many
And let your nigga and tell me how he feel me

Yes I talk shit, and we tost middle finger
Speed off bad bitch
Big benz get money fuck friends
Get your elevate, out in DC
I met the finish line what a game inz
With my top off in my spaceship
I'm looking 3D I meet your face bitch

[Hook]
I'm radio city, racks I got plenty
You don't know a bad bitch like me it ain't many
I can pull up in the minnie with my skirt real many
And let your nigga and tell me how he feel me, 'cause..
I've been doing this shit I ready made the killing
I'm so sick I need something the ceiling
Take a seat y'all I'm in the building
My times up bitches, I'm in the building
Hands in the air, round of applause
Hands in the air I just shut it down
Hands in the air round of applause
Hands in the air I just shut it down

I skull on my time fin the talk sleep
If I ain't the baddest bitch you can s*ck a dick
Deep rollie, suga coddie, you know I roll it
You know I through it up on whacks, so work it on it
The bitch independent, come or at least swag
Kim Kay curves, we trip kay bad
And I ain't got to prove myself the name bitch
I've been making hits after hits after hits

[Hook]
I'm radio city, racks I got plenty
You don't know a bad bitch like me it ain't many
I can pull up in the minnie with my skirt real many
And let your nigga and tell me how he feel me, 'cause..
I've been doing this shit I ready made the killing
I'm so sick I need something the ceiling
Take a seat y'all I'm in the building
My times up bitches, I'm in the building
Hands in the air, round of applause
Hands in the air I just shut it down
Hands in the air round of applause
Hands in the air I just shut it down

P**sy on this nigga he came back to me
With a plate full of fame he said it's all for me
I ain't' wanna be a rapper can't came to me
You bitches tryin too hard, it ain't a thing for me
I've been whipping exotic, till your flights to a rise
Lands course to the goddess, bitch you know I'm the hottest
Now I'm addicted to rapping, this bitches they all rapping
'cause now I'm back in the building, and it feels like I'm trapping

[Hook]
I'm radio city, racks I got plenty
You don't know a bad bitch like me it ain't many
I can pull up in the minnie with my skirt real many
And let your nigga and tell me how he feel me
