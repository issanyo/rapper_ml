Go hard or go home, go hard or go home
Go hard or go home, go hard or go home

What your weed like, what your bed like
What your heels like, what your eyes like
What your bread like, what your car like
What your crib like, what your life like?

I'm in the club with a thousand dollar wig on
Got an ass that a nigga wanna feel on
Pussy lips that you wanna pop the peel off
Two stepping with my rear bottom heels on
Lady in the streets, but a whore in the bed
Tricks with the head, make him spend more bread
Little boys get treated like sex toys
Fuck him in his mouth, yet he run and tell his homeboys
But if the money long he can put the rubber on
Rag city bitch, rag city hoe
I'm a different breed and I do it for the jizz
Masserati, no rims, do it for the scam

Go hard or go home, go hard or go home
Go hard or go home, go hard or go home

What your weed like, what your bed like
What your heels like, what your eyes like
What your bread like, what your car like
What your crib like, what your life like?
