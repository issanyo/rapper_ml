[Verse 1: Trina]
I wanna take this time out from rapping right now
And share something really personal to the world
I wanna dedicate this to my baby
Since I know that he listening , I'm gone always be your girl
See maybe y'all never been in love like I've been in love
And maybe you've never felt the things that I've felt
See I've never had this tingle inside from a man
Feels like he makes my heart melt
I mean the way that he looks at me
Is a look I've never got from another brother
He's cool, got swagg, calm, collective
And you know what else? He's a damn good lover
See, he knows what it takes to keep a smile up on my face
And he knows when I'm feeling uncomfortable and our relationship is out of place
The taste of his lips, the swagg in his walk
How he's so disciplined, ambitious and the way that he talks
A capricorn, hmm hmm hmm, stole my heart and I don't even want it back
He can have it, he can have it, he can have it, he can have it
Cause he got it like that

[Break: Shonie]
He can have it baby, he can have it
Oh yeah, he can have it

[Verse 2: Trina]
So independent, focused, and he knows how to love
Who would have dreamed in a million year it would be you that I'd be speaking of
The tenth sign of a zodiac one of the most serious and stable, reliable, responsible
And the characteristic that I like most is ladies he always ready, willing, and able
Now when God created him I know he had to be in good mood
Because my man gives me the utmost respect
And ladies he's never disrespectful and he's never rude
Loving, caring, and giving; he's all of the above
I just wanna say thank you God for giving me all I've been dreaming of
I feel like Cinderella when she found her prince
I can't remember I was looking for love but I ain't been looking since
My capricorn, my capricorn, my capricorn

[Break: Shonie]
My capricorn, my capricorn, so sexy

[Verse 3: Trina]
His charm, his motivation, his patience
All combine together as one man, my man
Strong, but careful of every move that he makes
All the steps that he takes, real not fake
The Capricorn, the Capricorn, the capricorn
That's all I ever needed, all I ever wanted
So I took this time out of my life to let you know how I was feeling about my capricorn
My Capricorn, my capricorn, my capricorn
Baby I love you, your love's waiting here for you
So whereever you are, whatever station that you listening to right now, I'm here
Somebody call my capricorn home for me
Or better yet, I'll do it myself
