[Hook 1 - 1/2]
Are you waiting
Waiting for something that's wrong
Are you waiting
You know sometimes a girl must move along

[Verse 1]
As I vibe with the music, I just think about the times
I came in after a day and at times
Climbed in the same bed wished my man was lyin
He questioned me "I'm I defying (no)," I was lyin
He was a real good man, he worked and all
I wanted a hustle, so I can hurt the mall (shit)
I coulda made love, but I wanted to be fucked
He had a lot to offer it just wasn't enough
I like da candle-coated 'lac (uh huh) the niggas smokin sacks (i like da thugs)
The football games, fortunate and fame
And more importantly, I wanted me a name
The je-wells, the crew-es, the cell
No more projects, the foolish gets well (I'm tired of dat shit)
The (?) weed from Pre-me's on poken beans
And me, I'm still ghetto I push ah (?) when you see me on TV
But I'm all woman, uh

(Chorus 1x)

[Verse 2]
Yall know I'm from Miami right
But, do yall really know what Miami like
Miami life
Da fast pace, the comfy cash chase
Da clothes, cars, ohhh God
Niggas sell dope get rich
Bitches sell pussy get rich, get down or don't get shit (dats right)
No options, no college, no loans
No cash, No knowledge
I'm sexy as hell you know I'm gon profit
And trust me, my skills are well polished
I chat niggas down pat niggas down
Set him up right if he dat big a clown
I had to, well I didn't have to
But, what about me (sshhiitt) I had to have to
I wanted a Rolly a million dat'll hold me
Lock a access for Colby you know me (uh)

(Chorus 1x)

[Verse 3]
I'm da same woman, Mercedes or the Civic
Fuck the Cris, I just give it how I get it
I'm the spokesperson 4 ev'ry sista who soul seachin
Still strollin these clubs with no purpose
Stay in the mall and won't purchase
Straight boostin
Bad checks or they leasin they mouth
Robbers put a piece in their mouth
For whatcha man keep in their house
They pull gats for stacks tall as Shaq
You chickens don't know me well
I'm not impressed witcha Findi purses and ponytails
Always surface with your phony tails
When you need to be in school all day on a chase
I'm goin to work supported you and ur place
Or with a athletic wit a cool one in the safe
Why suck dick to keep food on the place
I (?) in baked potatoes take the payload

(Chorus 2x)

It's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong
