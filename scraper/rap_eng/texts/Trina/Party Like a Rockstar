[Verse 1: Shane Hendrix]
Tonight
Let's live in the moment
Don't think about nothin'
Just enjoy the night my friend
Oh, tonight (oh, tonight)
Time is frozen
No hands for you to watch
Don't you worry 'bout the clock

[Pre-Chorus: Shane Hendrix]
Tomorrow's not, promised so
You might as well, just let it go
Lose all your doubts, live in the now
Lose yourself, lose yourself

[Chorus: Shane Hendrix]
Ready set go now, lose yourself
Party like a rockstar, lose yourself
Sometimes you, gotta let it go (gotta let it go)
And leave it all out on the floor
Ready set go now, lose yourself, lose yourself

[Verse 2: Shane Hendrix]
Tonight
Let's make it beautiful
Leave your stresses all behind
Operate in a clear mind
Oh, tonight (oh, tonight)
You can lose control
Don't you ruin a good time
With all those worries in your mind

[Pre-Chorus: Shane Hendrix]
Tomorrow's not, promised so
You might as well, just let it go
Lose all your doubts, live in the now
Lose yourself, lose yourself

[Chorus: Shane Hendrix]
Ready set go now, lose yourself
Party like a rockstar, lose yourself
Sometimes you, gotta let it go (gotta let it go)
And leave it all out on the floor
Ready set go now, lose yourself, lose yourself

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
I just dip in the pink for the pink effect
D-D-D-Diamonds on my neck for the link effect
And I was wondering if I could lip-sync on that
You know my name ring (ding!) ring tinkerbells
W-W-W-Watch (Check!)
Chain (Check!)
They be on the rain (Check!)
I be on the move, they be reaching but they canâ€™t catch
I be with the baddest bitch on the island stylin'
Black Miley Cyrus, sayin' hi to pirates
I be singing them ballads when he tossing my salad
When I pet my parrot, all you see is colorful carrots
I be singing them ballads when he tossing my salad
When I pet my parrot, all you see is colorful carrots

[Chorus: Shane Hendrix]
Ready set go now, lose yourself, uuuu
Party like a rockstar, lose yourself
Sometimes you, gotta let it go (gotta let it go)
And leave it all out on the floor
Ready set go now, lose yourself, lose yourself
Ready set go now, lose yourself
Party like a rockstar, lose yourself (party like a rockstar)
Sometimes you, gotta let it go (gotta let it go)
And leave it all out on the floor
Ready set go now, lose yourself, lose yourself
