[Hook]
Don't you call me crazy
'Cause I'm not, I'm just obsessed with you
Now don't you call me crazy, no
'Cause I'm not, I'm just obsessed with you
I just want your touch, I wanna taste you
Some call it crazy, I call it passion

[Verse 1]
[?] on speed dial, in case I need to reach out
Promise after promise but you never see me keep 'em
I hate you then love you, just call me bipolar
Last thing you want is my temperature to go up
Throw a brick through your window with a bottle full of Etho
Trina turn the heat up, I'm sweatin' out a fever
If you don't let up, then I won't give up
[?], I'ma light the whole crib up

[Hook]
Don't you call me crazy
'Cause I'm not, I'm just obsessed with you
Now don't you call me crazy, no
'Cause I'm not, I'm just obsessed with you
I just want your touch, I wanna taste you
Some call it crazy, I call it passion

[Verse 2]
Caught me actin' loco
Pull up at your job goin' coastal
Payin' me no mind, that's a no no
Nowhere to hide, bitch, I'm out for my pogo
Uh oh, who said you got me out here lookin' thirsty
Standin' in the rain, why you tryna curve me?
Throwin' shade back like you never heard me
Fiendin' and I need a hit in the worst way
I just want your touch, I wanna taste you
Some call it crazy, I call it passion

[Hook]
Don't you call me crazy
'Cause I'm not, I'm just obsessed with you
Now don't you call me crazy, no
'Cause I'm not, I'm just obsessed with you
