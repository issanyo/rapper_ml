[Intro: Kelly Price]
Wohh
Oh mama, oh mama
You're the reason why I'm here, today
Holdin' my head high
Wasn't easy gettin' me here, today
I owe you my life
Been through every step along the way
Makin' sure that things will be alright
So mama please don't leave, don't leave, don't leave tonight
Mama please don't leave, don't leave, don't leave tonight
Mama please don't leave, don't leave, don't leave tonight
Please don't leave tonight

[Verse 1: Trina]
Dear mama, I know I gave you a lot of drama
Got you pissed off 'bout a lot of this is that dilemma
You remember in December, cold winter
You had a month of my delivery
You vowed to take care of me
G-g-gave birth to your baby girl
You always warned me 'bout these streets and this crazy world
Taught me how to survive and keep my head up
Taught me how to be a lady, stack my bread up
Yeah, no daddy in the picture
Thinking 'bout you mama
Got me running to the liquor
Mama where you goin'?
I'm gon' have to beg to differ
I'd rather go first, so I wanna go with you 'cause I can't do this without you

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
So mama please (You're the reason why I'm here, today)
Holdin' my head high
Wasn't easy gettin' me here, today
I owe you my life
Been through every step along the way
Makin' sure that things will be alright
So mama please don't leave, don't leave, don't leave tonight
Mama please don't leave, don't leave, don't leave tonight
Mama please don't leave, don't leave, don't leave tonight
Please don't leave tonight

[Verse 2: Trina]
Call yo mother
And tell her that you love her
'Cause when she gone, cold world
You'll never have another (Uh)
Truth is, that's when life begins
I bet yo moms is ya only true best friend
She gon' always have your back
She gon' always hold you down
Tell me who gon' take her place when nobody else around? (Uh)
Mama, you're irreplacable
So I'm gon' always put you first on the pedestal
Yes, sometimes I spazz out but you know I didn't mean it
We agree to disagree, conversation gettin' heated
At the end of the day, you know I really didn't mean
'Cause life without you, I'm defeated

[Bridge: Kelly Price]
It's a cold world, and life just ain't the same without you
I really need you mama, really need you mama
It's a cold world, life just ain't the same without you
Mama, ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
You're the reason why I'm here, today
Holdin' my head high
Wasn't easy gettin' me here, today
I owe you my life
Been through every step along the way
Makin' sure that things will be alright
So mama please don't leave, don't leave, don't leave tonight
Mama please don't leave, don't leave, don't leave tonight
Mama please don't leave, don't leave, don't leave tonight
Please don't leave tonight
