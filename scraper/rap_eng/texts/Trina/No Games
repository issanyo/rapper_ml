[Hook]
I won't play your games no more
I won't play your games no more
If you won't believe my motives or
If you want to leave this longing home
Well, I won't play your games no more

[Verse 1]
Last time I just broke down, he was playin' round with my freedom
Rude ways he would talk to me, I had to realize I didn't need him
Sex and my best friend when she really wasn't no bestie
A lot of shit was runnin' through my head but I was 'fraid they always gon' catch me
What did I gain? I lost everythin'
Got caught in this whip, I'm embarrassed, ashamed
All I got is my name, all I got is my name
So I crawled out of that dog pit and I shined bright as a diamond
So when the haters wished that I fell off, my fate made me keep climbin'

[Pre-Hook]
How was I lovin' and trustin' and fuckin' that nigga that ain't bein' real?
Why was I settlin' and let him play with my feelin's when I kept it real?
I just snapped, I pulled the trigger, 6 shots, third of December
Told that nigga had a bad temper, why he forget I'm a boss bitch
Told that hoe don't cross this, don't put me the middle that bullshit
'Cause I'm a real G's on some boss shit, I'm a real G and I'm a boss bitch
My heart, don't touch my heart
I made it clear from the start
If you break it, it's broke forever
But I guess he wasn't that smart

[Hook]
I won't play your games no more
I won't play your games no more
If you won't believe my motives or
If you want to leave this longing home
Well, I won't play your games no more

[Verse 2]
Who am I? I'm confused, been lost without direction
All the games and lies been told, I'm the one they question
Red and blue, strobe lights, 10 placed in the whole damn section
Stripped from all my everythin' 'cause now they had the weapon
Your Honor, it was self defence, no house, no picket fence
Now the State has evidence and they chargin' me with the precedence
Love has made a fool, love made me break the rules
Love never ever loved me, love turned out so uncool

[Pre-Hook]
How was I lovin' and trustin' and fuckin' that nigga that ain't bein' real?

I just snapped, I pulled the trigger, 6 shots, third of December
Told that nigga had a bad temper, why he forget I'm a boss bitch
Told that hoe don't cross this, don't put me the middle that bullshit
'Cause I'm a real G's on some boss shit, I'm a real G and I'm a boss bitch
My heart, don't touch my heart
