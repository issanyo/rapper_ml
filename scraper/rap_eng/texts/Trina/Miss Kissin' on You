(you)
Boosie badass
When you miss somebody, you miss somebody
That's how it is (straight up)
I'm a send this out to the few women I was in love with (wassup)

Oooh I miss kissin on
I miss kissin on you
You know I miss kissin on you
I miss kissin on (you)
Miss touchin on you baby
I miss touchin on you
I miss touching on you baby
I can't stop thinki about (you)
I can't stop thinkin about you girl
I can't stop thinkin about (you)
I can't stop thinkin about you girl

Why do I feel so lonely in a major way?
You know this shit was real and you know it baby
I didn't wanna baby, It did drive you crazy
Even though you gotta man you forever my lady

I miss sippin on your daiquiris
I miss your macaroni and cheese, yes indeed
With no care, I hit you bare, you know wassup
Knew when your body would nut, I taught you everythang
Make you cry, make you smile, at the same time
Dumb shit, baby girl I miss your tongue kiss

Miss layin in the bed with you
Miss your people and the soul food they fed a nigga
Most of all I miss you, I'm havin flashbacks
Of you comin across the track with your hair wrapped
Miss talkin on the phone til' the early morning
Making love off Keith Sweat songs
No one can do me like (you)

I miss kissin on you
You know I miss kissin on you
I miss kissin on (you)
Miss touchin on you baby
I miss touchin on you
I miss touching on you baby
I can't stop thinki about (you)
I can't stop thinkin about you girl
I can't stop thinkin about (you)
I can't stop thinkin about you girl

Trina

It's no mistake that I'm amazin, the epitome
You kissin, touchin, lovin my body, the things you do to me
You keep it true to me, all this shit ain't new to me
I been messin with ballers kept me laced in top jewlery

A hood nigga like you, yeah I like that
Your swaggs on point and you keep me comin right back
When you text I write back, yeah right back

I know you like that, that's why I handle that

Bedroom lights off, we kissin slow to a track
It ain't even bout the sex, I crave the gangsta way you act
When you all up in that, you so smooth with it
That's why I never hesitate to say "daddy come and get it"

I got my Vicky's on and Diamond Princess perfume
I can't help but think about the things we do up in the room
When it's just me and you
A fantasy come true
I can't describe Ooohhh
I miss kissin on you

I miss kissin on you
You know I miss kissin on you
I miss kissin on (you)
Miss touchin on you baby
I miss touchin on you
I miss touchin on you baby
I can't stop thinkin about (you)
I can't stop thinkin about you girl
I can't stop thinkin about (you)
I can't stop thinkin about you girl

I swear to god I miss it all
The way that you would call
Beatin up your pussy, knockin pictures off the wall
In the studio thinkin to myself, "I got one song left, and I'm comin home to you"

Love it when I hit you from the back and you look back at me
Our sex attractive, like metal to a magnet
Turn that T.I. On, that's her shit right there
Get drunk, now she hollerin, "that's her dick right there"

I send this out to the ladies who had my head gone
A pretty black girl, a couple red bones
I guess we learn from each other cause we steppin-stones
With kids now like "damn, that's how it is now"

Ridin to New Orleans, laughin the whole time
Livin life with out a care, walking down cannery
I remember how you smell, the polish on your toes
Remember the first time you went down low
Nobody did it like (you)

I miss kissin on you
You know I miss kissin on you
I miss kissin on (you)
Miss touchin on you baby
I miss touchin on you
I miss touchin on you baby
I can't stop thinkin about (you)
I can't stop thinkin about you girl
I can't stop thinkin about (you)
I can't stop thinkin about you girl
