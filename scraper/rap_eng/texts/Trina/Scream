Hungry music, arghhh

See what you like that
I'm talking to you, yeah you

Hey baby, come and show me what it do
I never had a guy like you, so real
So kind and might fine
I like the way you ease my mind
And the way you take your time with me
Take me to ecstasy

Alone in this room, then my love go through you
Don't need no food
I'm all game, see it on my face, babe
What you wanna do, I'm settled and ready for you
So make your move
I got what you want so work it till I love it boy, whoa

[Chorus:]
Boy keep doing what you doing, don't slow it down
Baby don't stop no
Keep it right there, right in now you're in my spot, oh
Keep working, keep working, working
Keep working, keep working, working
Keep on working and you'll make me scream

Hey baby, you coming on strong tonight
Feel like I'm on a different high
You're my champion, you got the victory tonight
I like the way, the way we grind
And the way you make it real freaky
Takes me to ecstasy

Alone in this room, then my love go through you
Don't need no food
I'm all game, see it on my face, babe
What you wanna do, I'm settled and ready for you
So make your move
I got what you want so work it till I love it boy, whoa

[Chorus:]
Boy keep doing what you doing, don't slow it down
Baby don't stop no
Keep it right there, right in now you're in my spot, oh
Keep working, keep working, working
Keep working, keep working, working
Keep on working and you'll make me scream

I'm so, I'm so elegant and so exquisite
If you say the magic words might let you get in it
Gotta promise no rush, you'll be gentle with it
I like a mean backstroke, yeah boss, get it
We could do it in the ghost, if the wind does tinted
We could write a new book call it sex reinvented
Or sohuld we make a movie, sold to public arena
I'll let you start up my motor
See this real fat engine
Now let's start with some foreplay
Felation, 69 daddy, we could do that all day
And louboutins that's the best way
And when I drop the trenchcoat, can you promise me a long day
Cause I'm a rider, put that thing inside
I bet I make it grip, like I'm gripping you with plyers
Them bitches liars, ain't nothing bad as this
Got niggas eating this, call a nigga pie up

[Chorus:]
Boy keep doing what you doing, don't slow it down
Baby don't stop no
Keep it right there, right in now you're in my spot, oh
Keep working, keep working, working
Keep working, keep working, working
Keep on working and you'll make me scream
