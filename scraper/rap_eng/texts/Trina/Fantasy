Uhh-huh
The mind is a terrible thing to waste yo
Ain't nothing like an ol' good night sleep
Ain't nothin wrong with fantasizin'
Day dreamin'
Hehe

[TRICK DADDY & SHONIE]
Put me into your fantasy
I wanna be in your fantasy
Make me part of your fantasy
I wanna be in your wildest dreams
Put me into your fantasy
I wanna be in your fantasy
Make me part of your fantasy
I wanna be in your wildest dreams

[TRICK DADDY]
I made her cum for the first time
She tried to run, I made her cum twice
I know how to work mine
She about to fall out
She can't take the way her knees shake
She can't walk
She'd rather crawl out
I get behind her and then crawl with her
I get on all fours like a dog
And put it all in her
(RUFFF)
"deeper, deeper" what she keep tellin' me
I'm all up in that
And boy she lovin' it
The wetter it gets
The better it gets
And when it grips and slips
The better the dick
And it gets no better than this
I get low and blow in that asshole
And give that pussy a kiss
(mwaah)
I'm turned on by the form of her lips
And that pretty mouth got me about to pull my dick out
But I'm tryin' not to wile out
I can't let the freak in me fuck up the fantasy

[TRICK DADDY & SHONIE]
Put me into your fantasy
I wanna be in your fantasy
Make me part of your fantasy
I wanna be in your wildest dreams
Put me into your fantasy
I wanna be in your fantasy
Make me part of your fantasy
I wanna be in your wildest dreams

[TRINA]
I'm havin' dreams bout deap throatin'
Swallow it all
Heads good, on call, I'm even chokin'
Turned on by this black flag
I wanna get "kay maa" tattooed on his fat ass
I got a fetish for them gansta ass niggas
Look at them suckers like
"fuck you other niggas"
I had a dream of being a pop star
But I popped off
Fucked around and got my rocks off
I like to turn young niggas out
Like to run em down
Put this pussy in they mouth
And turn around ride they dick till they out
Tell em
"yo, get your shit
You gotta go
See
You're too young and restless to marry me
You're too goddamn poor to take care of me
Please calm your nerves boo
You're scarrin' me
Besides that you're about to fuck up the fantasy"

[TRICK DADDY & SHONIE]
Put me into your fantasy
I wanna be in your fantasy
Make me part of your fantasy

[TRICK DADDY]

You ain't gotta try hard

But your shouldn't of said that..."

[TRINA]
"Now, do you mind if I invite a friend?

[TRICK DADDY]
"I'm down with anything
Coz there is no limits and rules
Or what you do in somebody's dreams"

[SHONIE]
Well, please don't wake me I'm dreamin'
