[Intro: Girl]
Hello to all my niggas and bitches
Welcome to Digglers Wild World of Girls
I'm sitting here with the Baddest Bitch (Thats Right)
So Trina tell us a little something about yourself

[Verse 1: Trina]
Hustla I'm the queen of this south shit
Tight with a cute face that's what I'm bout bitch
Sexy, specialize in fellatio
All about my pesos, never was a fake ho
Shot shore throw
Throw the cock like a flamethrower
In the mouth of a cock blower
Just a diva mack momma looking for them ends
Traded in the Lex for a G-5 Benz
Touring on the road getting stacks
20 grand karats for the show no tax
Bell-V is what I'm pourin on them hatas
Blinding with the lock no imitaders
Broke ass niggas getting on my nerves
Get sliced, diced, chopped, and served
Ask, am I off the chain? I won't lie
But I don't want your man boo fuck that guy, uh

[Interlude: Girl]
Oh, okay, all right
I see how y'all be getting down in the MIA
But Trina what I really wanna know is
How would you get with a nigga who live with a bitch?

[Verse 2: Trina]
Wait... for his bitch to live
Ms. Trina gotta trick up her sleeve
Open up the door I walk straight in the house
Put your man down and put my cock in his mouth
(Damn) I need a heavyweight like Georgy Foreman
To work my ocean like the Long Shoreman
I'm real successful, I live off interests
So get it right bitch I'm the Diamond Princess
Banking and its all for the cause
(Hey Trina would you suck a nigga dick) Bitch hell naw
And fuck what a bitch tell yall
Stay the fuck outta mine ho and go get a job, ugh

[Interlude: Girl]
Damn girl
You wild as fuck
But what I really wanna know is
How you set a motherfucker up...?

[Verse 3: Trina]
See a nigga pumpin gas, don't look
Get out your car slow drop your book
Sell em' with your name and your freak out game
And show a lil' shot of ass just to get in his brain
Tell em what he wanna hear, calm and slow
"You want this ass? Come on let's go"
Call my dawgs at the hotel, let em' know I'm coming
Bring em' upstairs and leave the car running
Get em' in the room don't be scared
Go in broke come out with bread
That's what a nigga get, playing with that cheese
Fun for a freaking, watch ya get skeeze
Out the door, real quick
Then out come my dawgs with the K's and shit
Thinking with your dick man that ain't nothing
(Trina one more thing) Naw no more questions

[Outro: Girl]
See now that's what I'm talking 'bout
We need more real motherfucking bitches representing real shit
You heard it live from the baddest bitch
Reporting live this is Ki Ki
