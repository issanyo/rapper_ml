[Hook: Trina]
Head turner, head turner
Off in bail harbor, I'm a bread burner
Head turner, head turner
He said my head game fire, got it from the furnace
Killing these hoes, someone bring a gurney
Still in beast mode, hell yeah let's confirm it
I just keep it going, more and further
Long story short, I'm a head turner

[Verse 1: Trina]
Styling on em hard, I'm a beautician
Yeah she got some too, but these the new editions
You might do it big, but I do it bigger
I'm in the deepest pool of money, bitch are you a swimmer?
In a day, I can get what you get in a month
Ching, ching, ching, spend that on some Yves Saint Laurent
Ching, ching, ching, spend that on some Yves Saint Laurent
I'm the baddest you can ask these bitches
Yeah they know whats up

( [Hook: Trina] )

[Verse 2: Trina]
What page you on? Not mine
Talking all this shit will get you knocked off
Ho, I'm the baddest bitch that's in the archive
Hundred fifty thousand off the lot, nigga car drive
Doing me, what the fuck you think I came for?
You say that it's going down, I can make it go way lower
Tell em bring more bottles in my section
From the bottom full of throttle I'll be rapping
