{Trina}
Da bitch is back
I say the bitch is back
Yeah the bitch is back
I got the keys I'm fen to drive come on let's ride

[Verse 1]
Back seat Phantom dark tents rolled down
Didn't want to see her look at me now
Say she couldn't rap but I'm still here standing
Da Baddest Bitch is what the fuck they yelling
She's not real that one's fack
I step in the booth kill a track one take
Trina won't break I'm so heavy weight
Look at the map, I'm from the gun shaped state
Don't nann bitch want it, bitch tighten up
Only bitch with a deal Slip N Slide what
Swam across the Atlantic, back stroked back
Just mark my words I'm a take that back
Gon burn these charts stack every lock
Gon grace every cover dis bitch here hot
To give you all a lesson
Let me put it on the dresser
Where I put my damn shoes I will not lose

(Hook)
Ya'll gon learn to respect the queen yesterday it was all a dream
Ya'll gon learn to respect the queen, yesterday it was all a dream
I'm Still Da Baddest Bitch (ah)
I'm Still Da Baddest Bitch (ah)
Ain't another I'm Da Baddest Bitch (ah)
Damn right I'm Da Baddest Bitch (ah)

[Verse 2]
It was all a dream, thinking she'll be gone like that
Wake up this ain't a dream your worst nightmares back
B. A. D. Bitch I'm bad to the bone
Home wrecker number 1 and queen of ringtones
Now observer the persona, fuck the feedback
I'm equavalent to none you punks is lab rats
Experimentin myspace searching for a hit
I bet ya price gon double with they drop dis shit
Skybox pimping break through all door
I'm Hurricane Katrina, when it rains it pours
Taking no paycheck watin over bitches, niggas can get it too
Cause I ain't nowhere through
Hood that'show you want it, hood cuz I'mma give it
Since I heard a motherfucker say the sky is the limit
Yeah I know you want, yeah cuz I'mma give it
Since I heard a motherfucker say that sky is the limit

(Hook)
