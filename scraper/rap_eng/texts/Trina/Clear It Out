[Verse 1]
Yea its clear
Im livin da life ov da rich n da famous yea
In every magazine published im gracin tha pagez
Media versus celebrities, its outrageous
Put on a few septix u can rock a few stagez
Im settin new standardz 4 women, rappaz embracin
Ma chronological makeup a switch a bitch pace up
A trend setta, go getta, money maka, bread winna
Dropped in 98
Had da world sayin nan nigga

[Chorus]
I been around da world
N er body hat'n
If dey talkn im da topic of da conversation
Now clear it out, clear it out
I had it up 2 here
Clear it out, clear it out
I had it up to here
I had a lot of friendz
Now got a lot of foez
When u gettin money, diz iz juz da way it goez
Now clear it out, clear it out
I had it up 2 here
Clear it out, clear it out
I had it up 2 here

[Verse 2]
Now er body talkn bout me
I could give a damn tho
If dey hatn now

1000 dollaz shoez, european jewelz
Million dolla crib wid da swimmin pool

Get yo own hoe dun worry bout ma revenue
I brought it from da hood 2 da big screen
Now im prime time cova ov tha magazine

[Chorus]
I been around da world
N er body hat'n
If dey talkn im da topic of da conversation
Now clear it out, clear it out

Clear it out, clear it out

Now got a lot of foez
When u gettin money, diz iz juz da way it goez
Now clear it out, clear it out
