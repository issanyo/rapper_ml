[Intro: Trick Daddy]
Flight 305 to Miami is now boarding
Slip-N-Slide collabo
I will always be the one to
Dade County
Bring you back, bring you back

[Chorus: Trick Daddy]
Fool's (Miami), paradise
You better think twice
'Cause it's not very nice
Fool's (Miami), paradise
You better think twice
'Cause it's not very nice

[Verse 1: Mike Smiff]
Well alright, it seem like broke days was the better days
When your whole neighborhood was HUD housing and Section 8
I was just in the seventh grade
When I made up my mind, my dream car was a seven tre
Wanted a donk, I was still at the bus stop
That was around the time Trick Thugs R Us dropped
305 on the baseball cap
Used to peanut butter jelly with the baseball bat
Realest killers on the block still jookin' and stickin'
And everybody used to rock Reeboks with Dickies
And my aunties was getting loose to Uncle Luke
My uncle them was selling dope and smoking boonk
That was way before the mollies came through
And way way after Hurricane Andrew
And way before the flakka fiends and skinny jeans
That real Miami life, it was paradise

[Chorus: Trick Daddy]
Fool's (Miami), paradise
You better think twice
'Cause it's not very nice
Fool's (Miami), paradise
You better think twice
'Cause it's not very nice

[Verse 2: Trina]
Reporting live from Liberty City
We in the heart of Miami, the nitty and gritty
See, I was raised in a different time
By some strong women with they own mind and they own grind
See my mama was a hustler
Taught me how to stack that money and make it double up
Picture me with my bamboo earrings
With my girls at the block party on Fifteenth
Wrist full of bangles, me and my girls
Rockin' ocean waves and leisure curls
FILAs, K Swiss with the ruffle socks
Way back then before they knocked down Scotts
Before the dope boys started riding on fours
It was trues and vogues, fifties and lows, and
I been driving dudes insane
Dade County, home of the baddest bitch in the game

[Chorus: Trick Daddy]
Fool's (Miami), paradise
You better think twice
'Cause it's not very nice
Fool's (Miami), paradise
You better think twice
'Cause it's not very nice

[Verse 3: Trick Daddy]
Let's take it back
We used to come through with the top down
Take the whole backseat out and watch the bitch beat out
My backyard was a reefer hole
Any thots wearing lil shorts, we called them skeezer hoes
Every Friday we was in the hay-hay
From 1 to 5 on Saturdays it was Kitty day
And we was Pac Jam junkies then
If you wasn't for them one of them beans you wasn't getting in
All them niggas off of Fifteenth Avenue
They was eating like them boys off of Malibu
And 2 Live was our niggas with attitude (NWA)
M&M boots, silk shirts, and Bally shoes
The Splash Down or the Goombay
Parade on six-two for Martin Luther King Day
And Overtown used to come alive
We used to give straight up fades before we did drive-bys

[Chorus: Trick Daddy]
Fool's (Miami), paradise
You better think twice
'Cause it's not very nice
Fool's (Miami), paradise
You better think twice
'Cause it's not very nice
