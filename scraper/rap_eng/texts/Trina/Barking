[Intro: Rick Ross]
I’m in the strip club nigga
I need 50 thousand and all one
She hot it going it nigga

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
She wanna do it like a dawg
Do it like a Dawg
She want to do it like a dawg
Do it like a dawg
Do it like a dawg
She want to do it like a dawg
Do it like a dawg

[Bridge: Rick Ross]
Got me barking in that pu$$y

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
I’m a big dawg, big dawg
Oh lord I’m a big dawg
Big dawg, big dawg

Oh lord I’m a big dawg

[Verse: Trina]
You got me feeling ratchet big fat nigga
Maybach keys, lay back nigga
I bust it wide open for that black card
I know the forecast you gon’ make it rain hard
I keep it waxed for ya, I’ll let your tongue feel it
And have you walking in this pussy when you standing in it
You got a lot of racks
I got a lots of treats
You got 14 you gon' need another inch
You got a lot of bricks and damn presidence
I want my spine fixed, I hope you came here to do the deal
Cause I’m paying people when it comes to the dollar bills
I don’t have no feelings when it come to how a bitch feels
I’m like Rihanna bitch, all I see is dollar signs
Zero zero zero zero zero zero zero dollar sign
Sliding down the pole gat you grabbing on your dick
Make it rain on this pussy while I top cash

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
She wanna do it like a dawg
Do it like a Dawg
She want to do it like a dawg
Do it like a dawg
Do it like a dawg
She want to do it like a dawg
Do it like a dawg
Do it like a dawg

[Bridge: Rick Ross]
Got me barking in that pussy
Barking in that pussy
Got me barking in that pusy
Barking in that pussy
Got me barking in that pussy
Barking in that pussy
Got me barking in that pussy
Barking in that pussy

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
I’m a big dawg, big dawg
Oh lord I’m a big dawg
Big dawg, big dawg
I’m a big dawg, big dawg
Oh lord I’m a big dawg
Big dawg, Oh lord
