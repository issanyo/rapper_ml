Got my double cup of scissor while I'm dancin' on yo mista
Smokin' hot like a swisher, he love it when I scissor
So I keeps in poppin', white boys they be stoppin'
They wanna have a taste of my vanilla sugar toppin'
He like "Ay girl cut it up for me"
C-C-C-Cut it up for me
I'm like "Ay boy you wanna go?"
Crusin' topless in the lambo
Newbo imports and whiskey
Drinks on me you know I'm wealthy
I'm the new bitch in town
No man's gonna tie me down

Woah oh
(Cut it up, cut it up, c-c-cut it up)
I like it when he cut it up, cut it up, c-c-cut it up
(I like it when she cut it up, cut it up, c-c-cut it up)
I like it when he cut it up, cut it up, c-c-cut it up

(The scissor)

[Allison]
So fresh, razor clean, got them Nikes and the bling
While he stuntin' in the club, Watch him dougie to some
Drinking goose cus it's cheap, we drink it every week
So let me see you do it, and scissor to the beat

I like it big, I like it rough, I like it when he cut it up
Fillin' up my water bottle, lots of vodka and a splash of throttle
Open close my legs all night, stop and go like traffic lights
Time to say goodbye, give this white girl a try

Woah oh
(Cut it up, cut it up, c-c-cut it up)
I like it when he cut it up, cut it up, c-c-cut it up
(I like it when she cut it up, cut it up, c-c-cut it up)
I like it when he cut it up, cut it up, c-c-cut it up

[Trina]
Yeah, Trina
The record spin like a blizzard
And all my white girls just scissor
Let's drink it we'll get slizzered
It's diamond princess if you with her

Light that fire, cut that rug, cut up the club lets throw money up
We like it, they like it, this number one, psychic
Slip scissor cut you in half
Built up cups, all in my style
Bottles cop, models stop, what is the cake if the cherry on top
The new may rockin', Mazaratti, two bugatti's, time to party
The club get packed so fast, 'cause I got all eyes on this ass

Woah oh
(Cut it up, cut it up, c-c-cut it up)
I like it when he cut it up, cut it up, c-c-cut it up
(I like it when she cut it up, cut it up, c-c-cut it up)
I like it when he cut it up, cut it up, c-c-cut it up

I break it down when I dance
Watch me do it with no hands
I break it (down) break it (down)
Break B-B-Break it down

Woah oh
(Cut it up, cut it up, c-c-cut it up)
I like it when he cut it up, cut it up, c-c-cut it up
(I like it when she cut it up, cut it up, c-c-cut it up)
I like it when he cut it up, cut it up, c-c-cut it up
