I got an ass so big like the sun
Hope you got a mile for a dick, I wanna run
Slap it in my face, shove it down my throat
Nigga, where your blunt? I can make this pussy smoke

I know how to fuck, I know how to ride
I can spin around and keep the dick still inside
Now your mouth wide, you looking real scared
I'm a maneater, headhunter, I'm prepared

Yeah you running now, you running
I'ma put this pussy on you just like this

Put this pussy in yo jaws now, smack
Like it's Thanksgiving and it ain?t coming back
Collard greens, neckbones, nigga chew this ass
Both hold inspections, don't stop 'til it pass

Licky licky licky licky licky for a hour
I'ma make it rain for you here's a golden shower
Smell it like a flower, my pussy is a rose
Come a little closer, I wanna fuck your nose

If you want it you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it
Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict

Look back at me, look back at me
Look back at me, look back at me, girl
Look back at me, look back at me
Look back at me, look back at me, girl

Look back at me, girl
Look back at me, girl
Look back at me, girl

If you want it you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it
Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict

Thoroughbred red broad in my bed
Up all night, took pipe, gave head
Ass like Trina, face like Mya
Shot it on her chest she said, "Daddy, aim higher"

Put jimmy on her titties and I bust off wicked
Gave her mayonnaise on the face, pearl necklace
We turned the camera on we did a sex scene
She called me R. Kelly and I called her

That?s my bitch right there nigga

Hand full of ass and a fist full of weed
Ass in the air, face down on your knees
I'm a beast when I fuck, I'ma put it in your gut
I'ma have you saying, "No, please, let me get off"

I'ma make you say that's the spot don't take it out
I'm feeling like Akinyele, put it in your mouth
Kanye tell them gold digging hoes that we pimping in the South
And it ain't payday unless nuts in your mouth

If you want it you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it
Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict

Look back at me, look back at me
Look back at me, look back at me, girl
Look back at me, look back at me
Look back at me, look back at me, girl

Look back at me, girl
Look back at me, girl
Look back at me, girl

Back it up, drop down to your knees
Bring it up real slow make one cheek freeze
Back it up, drop down to your knees
Bring it up real slow make one cheek freeze

If you want it you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it
Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict

(Look look look look)
Back at you for what?
I'm trying to concentrate on busting me a nut
I'm thinking about Trav, I'm thinking about Bo
Little dick nigga, shit, hurry up, I gotta go

Since they in prison pussy nigga make me know
That you ain?t a virgin, ain?t you done this before?
Fuck me 'til you can't breath, 'til you swim and scream help
It?s your lucky day all the lifeguards left

Little dick ass nigga
You better get your face down here and eat this pussy

Dribble these titties on your lips
While you're doing that put your hands around my hips
Bounce me like a ball, slam me like K-Mart
On and off the dick better known for breaking hearts

Nigga call a cab I'm finna pack my shit and leave
Shouldn't have let you fuck, now that?s some shit I can't believe
Wasting my time fucking all off beat
Pussy nigga next time when you see me don't speak

If you want it you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it
Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict

Look back at me, look back at me
Look back at me, look back at me, girl
Look back at me, look back at me
Look back at me, look back at me, girl

Look back at me, girl
Look back at me, girl
Look back at me, girl

If you want it you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it
Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict
