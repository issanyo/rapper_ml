[Trina talking....]

I'm the queen till the death of me
Can't compare me, I'm higher than that epitome
I'm the queen till the death of me
I'm higher than that epitome
I'm the queen till the death of me
I put you hoes up under extortion

[Verse 1]

I switch 24 outfits in one fucking day
24 cars in 24 different driveways
My money long, mandingo
I'm talking guap, jackpot, the casino
Brazilian long weave with some bow legs
Work in the trunk for my nigga I'mma thorough bread
I'm wiping pots, baking cookies for the block
Now I'm off to meeting my secret service, I'm Barrack

[Hook]

I'm sliding soft, my whip clean
I'm still the baddest bitch that you ever seen
Money ain't a problem
Money ain't a problem
I'm sliding soft, my whip clean
I'm still the baddest bitch that you ever seen
Money ain't a problem
Money ain't a problem
I ain't got no money problems

[Verse 2]

Everything top of the line and my shoes match my purse
How come, they think it's a funeral, they think the Ghost is a hearse
I been burried you bitches, bitch, I'm six albums in
You gotta go through the queen before the game let you in
See, I'm gonna eat regardless, I've been sold, my harvest
And I don't beg no pardon, and from what I heard they starving
Money all in my bag, ATM swag
Just left the island, got jet lag, in a G5 to the G wagon and
I'm pulling up to Bell Harbor
Shopping till my feet hurt, watch me pop my collar
Security and my chauffer, red bottoms my loafers
The bank account full, I got workers
The bank account full, so much money in it
I could write a million checks and bet the check won't fucking dent it
Got so many M's you would swear a bitch was humming (hmmmmmmm)
Cause I live by 'you ain't talking money, you ain't talking nothing'

[Hook 2]

I'm sliding soft, my whip clean
I'm still the baddest bitch that you ever seen
Money ain't a problem
Money ain't a problem
I'm sliding soft, my whip clean
I'm still the baddest bitch that you ever seen
Money ain't a problem
Money ain't a problem
I ain't got no money problems

[Verse 3]

Money ain't a problem so I don't ever hate
I'm busy skipping lines while you bum bitches wait
2,000 plates, panoramic fucking views
You know it's Cinderella, you can tell by my shoes
That money ain't a problem so I don't ever hate
I'm busy skipping lines while you bum bitches wait
2,000 place, panoramic fucking views
I'm shitting on you bitches, bird flu
Million stunner, track race runner
Field goal punter, wild jungle hunter
I got diamonds in the backseat, chauffer, no taxi
Got the coupe painted yellow gold so you bitches know that's me
That's me, the bitch that you love to hate
If it's a heice, I'm the bitch that got away
If in the fight, you the bitch got put away
And I'm the bitch getting money each and every day
