[Verse 1: Trina]
Out of order, shop closed, no more free throws
And it ain't no more, lickin' in his speed coat
Know better, do better
Had it real good, rap bitch with her own trend setter
I never asked him for shit
Basic ass nigga, really wasn't 'bout shit
Man, I'm tired of puttin' these niggas on and makin' 'em famous
They be sayin' they love me, then they doin' the same shit
These niggas wanna be me, girl, he want the fame
Wanna be on TV, man, what's wrong with him?
I be watchin' they moves and I be tellin' my bitches
Man, he be thinkin' I'm clueless, so I'm out for his riches
Man, karma be a bitch
Didn't get far, these niggas thinkin' they slick
Then they come back crawlin' and shit
Niggas lost everythin', now they on they dick

[Pre-Hook: Trina]
Nigga, I don't wanna talk
I erased all your math, social media blocked
And it ain't my fault
You got caught in the web, what the fuck you thought?
Ain't no bitch that better than me
I'm young Moses, I could part any sea
So think twice when you checkin' for me
'Cause it ain't no comin' back, I'm a real OG

[Hook: Dyna Edyne]
You wanted to leave, baby
But see I don't need you, baby
Don't you come runnin' back to me
Runnin' back to me
Don't you come runnin' back to me
Runnin' back to me
You wanted to leave, baby
But see I don't need you, baby
Don't you come runnin' back to me
Runnin' back to me
Don't you come runnin' back to me
Runnin' back to me

[Verse 2: Trina]
See the face on 10, body on 10
And the bank account on win
They see me in the field, man, I'm stashin' them commas
I pull up on these niggas in the flyin' saucer
Buyin' that nigga, became my own boss
No bra, titties out, bitch, I think I'm Rick Ross
Think I'm Big Meech, make chop like Bruce Lee
And the last thing you should think, a bitch sleep
My game on fleek
And your new bitch, she homeless chic
I laugh at it 'cause she's a small matter
I live a high rise, her section 8 chatter
And you ain't no better
Thinkin' these hoes gon' make you better, what a fuck nigga?
Lil nigga, go and play with these hoes
'Cause you ain't in my league, nigga, I ball with pros

[Pre-Hook: Trina]
Nigga, I don't wanna talk
I erased all your math, social media blocked
And it ain't my fault
You got caught in the web, what the fuck you thought?
Ain't no bitch that better than me
I'm young Moses, I could part any sea
So think twice when you checkin' for me
'Cause it ain't no comin' back, I'm a real OG

[Hook: Dyna Edyne]
You wanted to leave, baby
But see I don't need you, baby
Don't you come runnin' back to me
Runnin' back to me
Don't you come runnin' back to me
Runnin' back to me
You wanted to leave, baby
But see I don't need you, baby
Don't you come runnin' back to me
Runnin' back to me
Don't you come runnin' back to me
Runnin' back to me
