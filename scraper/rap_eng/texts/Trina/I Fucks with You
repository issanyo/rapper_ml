I’m tryina vibe up, live the life and get high as fuck
I keep me a stable of stallion, them broke dudes can’t buy nuthin
Nah, they ain’t worth your time, you need somebody that’s certified
Come over here where the grass is greener, and leave his ass where you last seen him
Just name that place I take it up, grind 1 12 ever ate in there
Go ahead thank god cause he raised a player
And tell your man I got game for sale

Cause I come through and knock down all walls
And I wish we could just lay up all day
But once we get away, your man gonn hate, ah

[Hook]

They can’t tell us what we can’t do, nah

But baby girl I’m tryina get missin yeah
Get a room, get a room, make love
Cause I fucks with you, I fucks with you

I need a nigga that’s on something
Not a petty ass nigga that frown when I want something
Red bottoms with the spikes
Head on the first night, don’t be scared to bite
I mean all about your money homie
Cause if you ain’t got swag, I’ma prolly act funny
Homie I can’t stand no lame
9 times out of 10, your bet he can’t hang
I like a nigga with stamina, that make me feel like an amateur
We do the dougie when we do it on camera
And I ain’t never been the one to take advantage of

We just do what we do
And you don’t run your mouth, that’s why I fucks with you
