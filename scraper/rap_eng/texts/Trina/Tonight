[Intro: Trick Daddy]
You lookin' real good baby
I just want you to know
I had a wonderful time this evening
But unfortunately
I guess this part of the story
Well we tell eachother goodnight
Nah how about this
How about I break all the rules
And tell you what I really been thinkin'

[Hook: Jaheim]
Girl you got the big ol ass, and bow legs
And fine hair
And all the shit that I want
Sexy motherfucker
You acting like you want it right now
Let a nigga know
Is we gun fuck tonight
My dick is gettin' rock hard
Oh my god
There's gonna be some fuckin' tonight
Take your panties off
Move your panties off to the side
And let a nigga know
Is we gun fuck tonight

[Verse 1: Trick Daddy]
See good pussy
Will bring the freak out ya
But if you eat it and don't get cheated
The first off I beat the breaks off her
No sense in half-steppin'
Get serious
Get the titties suckin' like
Clit rubbin' and ass grabbin'
I eat that pussy ass backwards
A few strokes of this long warm tongue
Should make the pussy cum
So much for round one
I spend a whole round two and back again
Stick in move
Stick in move

[Hook: Jaheim]

[Verse 2: Trina]
I need a real man
I'm sick of playin' with lil' boys
I'm tryin' to explore more like hot oils and sex toys
I can't keep fakin'
Man I'm so backed up and
I can't eat I can't sleep
My knees weak makin' me keep shakin'
I need a real nigga to come save me
One who pamper me and bathe me
And make me wanna swallow his baby
Talkin' thug shit like fuck me crazy
From the back or in the butt
I'm like fuck me baby fuck me baby

[Hook: Jaheim]

[Verse 3: Trick Daddy]
All the matter is
I can get you wet again
Suck you fuck you better than
Any other nigga can
I specialize in multi orgasms
Gettin' rid of back spasms
And do it all without viagra
I'll fuck you all night
Make you sleep all day
Treat you to beakfast then
Eat you for breakfast
I know baby
I'm so unselfish
But you're lovin' it besides
I'm a freak so I can't help it
All I need is old slow songs
One cold shot of patron
See you walkin' around me in a thong
And it'll be over before the chorus come back on
You'll be leavin and I'll be ab libin'
And we'll be singin' our damn song
It's like the first time we made eachother cum
We'll be suckin' and fuck eachother
Taste eachother cum
No soul alive can erase what we done
All our horny sticky memories you are stuck to me permanantly

[Hook: Jaheim]
