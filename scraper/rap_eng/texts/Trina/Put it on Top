[Intro]
Said I love ya babe..
And I need ya darling..
Said I love ya babe..

[Chorus]
I'm a put that p-p-pussy on top (whoa!)
I'm a ride ya until that dick drop (damn!)
I'm a keep going, going non stop (c'mon!)
Till I hear ya say (Trina! God damn you a bad bitch!)
I'm a put that p-p-pussy on top (whoa!)
I'm a ride ya until that dick drop (damn!)
I'm a keep going, going non stop (uh huh!)
Till I hear ya say (Trina! God damn you a bad bitch!)

[Verse]
You know I'm off blast, you face off fast
I ain't into making love, I'm into getting cash
I'm making niggas scream! just like a wet dream
Suite 112 wit that "Peaches & Cream"
I'm a put that p-p-pussy on top
And ride that dick non stop till it drop
Miss Trina fin to make it, make it get hot
Come over here man, and show me what you got
I'll make you snap, crackle, pop
Then I'm a break ya pockets
Cop me charm bracelets, Louie Vuitton lockets
And I'm a keep ya harder than a rocket (ohhh)
New rims on my Benz, you can cop it (ohhh)
Get nasty, whip cream and chocolate
Ride that dick till it pop out the socket
Get off, lick lick lick me
It's Lil Pearly baby, no Vickies

[Chorus]

[Verse]
DP I'm back, you know the flow's hot
Soon as your clothes drop, I make your toes pop
Fresh out the hood bitch, I ride a good dick
Lil Mama hood rich, I got that good shit
Toot toot, beep beep, freak on the backseat
I make your heart beat fast like a track meet
I put the pussy on top wit a cherry in the middle
Don't be scared Daddy, lick it a little
Spend a few thou' nigga, Trick it a little
Then maybe now and then we can - kick it a little
Ohh, c'mon! (What you're saying girl, that you know)
(You gon put that on top of me?)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Girl give me that now now now, now now now
Girl give me that now now now, now now now
Girl give me that now now now, now now now
Girl I got this feeling way down in my bones
That make me wanna do it to ya, HEY!!
(Talk to 'em girl)

[Verse]
Anytime, anyplace, baby yeah anywhere
I put this thang on you daddy, I ain't never scared
Freaking in a six drop in the parking lot
I put the pussy on top and massage the cock
I'm too hot, too tight, ride dick just right
If you playing wit them M's play Grant just might (?)
Lay you down and undress you, red light special
You wanna bring your toy friend, I just might hit you

[Chorus]

[Outro - to fade]
Girl give me that now now now, now now now
