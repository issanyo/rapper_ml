[Hook x2]
You know I keep it wet. Call me "Aquafina"
Want to do the wild thing; funky cold medina
Ass so fat its popping out my jeans and
Watch me bust it open like I'm packing fucking ninas

[Verse 1: Trina]

Who dat? Dat bitch
Primetime. Top pick
Limelight. All mine
And I ain't leaving no room, so fetch bitch

And that's the memo. You already know my MO
Get a little head in the back of the limo
Then jump on the track like a sumo
I'm going to start smacking bitches. Jennifer
I'm going to bring hell to bitches. Lucifer
These hoes can't fuck with my swag
I'm a bad ass bitch with a big ass bag
Got long ass hair with a thick, fat ass
You was hot for a minute, now you yesterday's trash

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Trina]

I'm back in business. My naps over
Tell them jealous ass cunts move over
You can move in the back of this
I'm King Queen, checkmate a bitch
Lights out. I'm faded bitch. Come for me, don't do it bitch
Say it loud, epitome. I run these streets
Bitch, look at me. Look at me. Look at me
Hotter than grease. Sandra Dee
These boots were made for walking and I don't think, bitch, I'm finished yet
I'll let you know when I'm done, ho, because this pussy is so good and wet

What you say? I can't hear you. Speak up

[Hook x2]

I'm back in business. Pussy wet
I'm back in business. This pussy soaking wet
I'm back in business. I opened shop
I'm back in business. This bitch is smoking hot
