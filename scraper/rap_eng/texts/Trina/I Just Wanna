[Chorus: Arie]
I just wanna be the one you lovin on all through the night, yeah
I'mma drive you crazy, blow your mind, and do it just how you like, boy
Ooh i'mma sit on it, turn around, go in on it, i'm down to ride yeah
Put my hair up, then i throw that ass back, then you say go faster
Baby can you take that? take that!


[Verse 1: Trina]
Chew this pussy like some bubblegum, get them lips smackin
Cause when i jump on that dick, this ass gon get to clappin, uh
So gudda, freaky lil thang, in my neck and waist chain hit them corners on your plane
In my birthday suit
He a pussyholic, nasty lil bitch, you's just space for a toilet
We record it, rewind then playback
Driver roll up the partitian in the mayback
I take that and i won't make a sound
Riding on that dick let me adjust my crown
He couldn't hang, the dick went soft
So i jumped off that shit and threw my pussy in his mouth, uh


[Chorus: Arie]
I just wanna be the one you lovin on all through the night, yeah
I'mma drive you crazy, blow your mind, and do it just how you like, boy
Ooh i'mma sit on it, turn around, go in on it, i'm down to ride yeah
Put my hair up, then i throw that ass back, then you say go faster
Baby can you take that? take that!

[Verse 2: Miami]
It's outstanding my pussy ball like 2Pac
Wet like Niagra Falls off two shots
Bad bitch, nasty love, that's two thots
Watch me squirt like a juice box
I could ride on that pole like a stripper bitch
When you bust pussy make you want to tip a bitch
I could trick a bitch quick like Maurice
And have you crying for that pussy like Tyreese

[Verse 3: JT]
Yeah baby make a mess on this pussy
Gimme good brain take a test on this pussy
My shit wet uh-huh and it's good, shit
I've done turned you out got you talkin all mushy
Ass so tight you wanna tie me down
Imma energizer bunny need 4 rounds
I love when you beat it up, when you on ground
Anything is possible, yeah it's going down

[Verse 4: Arie]
I'm better candy that you bring up to your mama house
Play for keeps and its sweeter as you go south
You know it's fat... can you fit all of it in your mouth
I know you waiting for me baby boy, can't wait to lay me down
Without a doubt, I stay wet, tell me what's a drought
Throw it back to the beat, boy, watch it bounce (watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it)
Watch it bounce, babe

[Chorus: Arie]
I just wanna be the one you lovin on all through the night, yeah
I'mma drive you crazy, blow your mind, and do it just how you like, boy
Ooh i'mma sit on it, turn around, go in on it, i'm down to ride yeah
Put my hair up, then i throw that ass back, then you say go faster
Baby can you take that? take that!
