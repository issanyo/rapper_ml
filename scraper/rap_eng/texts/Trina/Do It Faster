[TWISTA]
Say Twista and Shaq, if you got stacks, tell 'em to bet it
I move a mob like a Telekinetic over the killa green!
Like a shawty that was showin’ her booty & it was softer than butter
I gotta cut her, like a guillotine!

Ain't no fuckin wit Superman and Bizarro, holdin shit up, while I represent for Chicago!
Every fine chick I find, I'm in it, and hit it like I'm on the line of scrimmage, I pull a dime in a minute!
Gotta peep on the game, I'm in the skybox
When it's over we pullin’ up in a black drop

Dutch had a track to drop so I’ll pop the top yellin’ what's happening
Mix the dro’ , hit the hoe, breaking my back to back is enough to make her come back again
I rap to win
Try to play me like I’m lame, I know that!
22 inches across with the chromate
TVs and the people know where ya dome at
Looking at my 2 AK's you wanna bone that
Nothin but brawls you're nothin the boss
Scrolling through players you're fucking em all
Gotta hit em til they’re full of Rigor Mortis
When im crushin ya’ balls cuz im openin em up in the draws
Kickin’ with the big pimps and the Po Pimp
I could make a whole meal like oatmeal ‘couse I be so real
Wishing they can, I be ready to rectify
Stood in there checking most grill
While I smoke kill
