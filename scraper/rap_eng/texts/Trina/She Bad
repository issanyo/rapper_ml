I know you got a lotta warm wounds
I know the city girls ya favourite song too
I know you like to blow up bad boys
Shop it, instagram
Aw yeah just show them bitches how you move

You the baddest in the city, yeah you know it
You make a nigga put the ring on you
You make a nigga wanna sing to you
No separation baby, work the whole thing for you

Baby oh you move like dat
Baby oh you walk like dat
Had the bottles with designer on the back
Lookin' like some food I eat it for a snack (Like a snack)

And she got a little twist to her walk
Little slide to her talk
Had a lotta wears but she took a lotta loss
Took a couple flights fuckin' with a couple bottles
Got a few secrets and you'll probably never know

'Cause she bad
It's 'cause she bad
Oh girl you know you bad
Girl you know you bad

Baby girl you know you bad (Yes you know)
Make a nigga wanna blow all cash (All cash)
Aww them niggas buy you all-new bags (All-new bags)
You deserve the bigger living
Trading all the latest fashion
Making other bitches mad (Other bitches mad)

You gotta blow a couple thousand on this bad bitch
This VVS on my wrist a conversation piece, to say the least
I pray but I still get street
You kinda low on the funds then shh, don't speak

I deserve it all, and I'm gonna play the nigga
Solve some math problems then defy them digits
Let me help you spend it
I'm tryna own funk rent[?]
Cause the world is mine and everything in it

'Cause she bad
It's 'cause she bad (Cause I'm bad)
Oh girl you know you bad
Girl you know you bad

Baby girl you know you bad (Yes you know)
Make a nigga wanna blow out cash (Out cash)
Aww them niggas buy you all-new bags (All-new bags)
You deserve the bigger living
Trading all the latest fashion
Making other bitches mad (Other bitches mad)

Make 'em get them bags up
Get that cash up
Yeah nigga sleepin' all day, wake his ass up
Nigga better mess up
Get them pants up
A bad bitch want a nigga that's a boss, what

Nigga get them bags up
Get that cash up
Yeah nigga sleepin' all day, wake his ass up
Nigga better mess up
Get them bands up
A bad bitch want a nigga that's a boss, what, yeah
