[Verse 1: Molly Brazy]

You don't know naan bitch
That be fucking it up like Molly
Flex on a bitch, and have a nigga call me
Then play that pussy nigga for some dollars
I can wrap the beef up like a quarter
Keep talking sideways, bitch I'm like, "Pardon me?"
Big Brazy, I do not do no arguing
She taking shots to the face like she partying
Yeah, you don't know naan bitch
That'll stack the money up and flip it
That'll buy more bottles than the niggas
Get a section for just for me and my bitches
Make it rain on them strippers
Deep in that water like flippers
You know Molly getting richer
Hating hoes getting sicker
You don't know naan bitch, that woke up like this
Diamonds all over my wrist
Versace all over my hips
Gucci all on my kicks
Stand on the couches and turn up the V.I.P
Snuck in my pole just in case niggas trip
It's Brazy gang 'lil bitch!

[Chorus: Molly Brazy]
You don't know naan, bitch (uh, uh)
No, no, no
You don't know naan, bitch (uh, uh)
No, no
[x2]
You don't know naan bitch
That stay on her shit because she a boss
Keep pissing hating bitches off
She cannot lose, will not take a loss
You don't know naan, bitch (uh, uh)
No, no, no
You don't know naan, bitch (uh, uh)
No, no


[Verse 2: Trina]

Throw me in a room with bitches guess who they gon pick
