(feat. Qwote)

Do you Trina take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband
To have and to hold from this day forward
For better or for worse
For richer for poorer
In sickness and in health
To love and to cherish
Form this day forward
Until death do you part

Uh!
I guess I wasn't enough for you
The things I done for you
Call me I run to you
Whenever you want me to
What have I done to make you hurt me a time or two
Probably more then a few
My heart still beats for you
Wonder what did I do
Damn I should've knew
But still didn't have a clue
My life would be so blue
Yeah I'm hurt it's true
Not feeling me next to you
Laughing at things you do
Kissing and calling me boo
Now it's hard to eat
Damn I feel so weak
And I can't get no sleep
My eyes continue to leak
Pouring out like the rain
This hurts more then pain
Apologizes with the pain
I went against the brain
Baby please don't go
I need you more n more
I'm breaking down on the floor
One thing you should know
Is that I got you
No matter who tells you that
The love we had was wack
Know that I need you back here

Baby Don't go Don't go [x3]
Baby Don't walk away
Baby Don't go Don't go [x3]
Just stay with me

Cause if you leave baby baby you'll be breaking my heart
And if you leave baby baby I'll be torn apart
Don't walk away (Don't walk away)
Don't walk away (Don't walk away)
From me

Uh
So baby tell me that this ain't true
I open my heart to you
I changed the game for you
Gave up my friends for you
My life just ain't the same
I'm Reaching n calling your name
Remember the things I do
Cooking and cleaning for you
Taking good care of you and
Making sweet love to you
Baby just close your eyes
And picture my hips and thighs
Laying right next to you
I'm getting the best of you
Tell me you need me back
I promise I'm running right back
How did It come to this
Why did you run from this
My loving you got to miss
With you I was full of bliss
Baby please don't go
I just can't take no more
I'm screaming and kicking
Cause really I needs to know
Tell me she's not the one
Tell me I'm number one
And baby can you please tell me and you are still one
Baby it's tough love
Cause you been rough on me
I really miss the way you used to put that dick on me

Baby Don't go Don't go [x3]
Baby Don't walk away
Baby Don't go Don't go [x3]
Just stay with me

Cause if you leave baby baby you'll be breaking my heart
And if you leave baby baby I'll be torn apart
Don't walk away (Don't walk away)
Don't walk away (Don't walk away)
From me

Can't you see
What the hell you doing to me
I'm soaking wet (In tears)
Crying baby (over you)
All on my knees
I'm begging and pleading not to leave
So say that you'll stay (say that you'll stay)
Baby please stay (Pleaseee Stay)

Baby Don't go Don't go [x3]
Baby Don't walk away
Baby Don't go Don't go [x3]
Just stay with me
