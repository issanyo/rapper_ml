[Trina] (JE)
I need a hot thug who can handle this
And in the hot tub with the candles lit
I got the crissy-cris on a bucket of ice
Like Biggie Smalls say, we fuckin tonite
JE, Heartbreak make it flow better
Makin love on the bed full of rose pedals
Just hold on tight cuz my love is real
Ill make you feel extasy without the pills
I wonder how many licks do it take
To make you break, to make your body shake
Lick my inside-out, ride-out
Spend a week in Hawaii, hide-out
And if you want it, you know that I got it
Give it to me daddy, you know that im bout it
And if you throwin that dick, imma do my thing
And throw this pussy back at you like a boomerang
Uhuh-uh (If you want it girl) uh JE yall (I got it got it)
Trina, uh (come and get with me) So-So Def, Slip-n-Slide callabo'
(Girl I'll turn your body inside-out and, bring extasy)
2001, uh, y'all ain't ready
(If you want it, baby come and bring your body to me)
(If you need, girl I got it got it, got-got-got-got it)
