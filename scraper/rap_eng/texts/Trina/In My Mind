[Intro]
Rippa on the beat bitch
Yeaaaah, yeeeaah
Let me hear it

[Chorus: Ball Greezy]
In my mind, you'll always be my baby
In my mind, you'll always be my girl
In my mind, you'll always be my baby
In my mind, you'll always be my girl
Oooh, this is why I love you
This is why I love you
Cause you love me
Cause you love me

[Verse 1: Ball Greezy]
I don't care what nobody say
Cause you will forever be bae
Only time will tell when we meet again and today I'm gon pray
Your conversation I miss, how the pussy drip when I kiss it
But I was too far gone with these bitches
When I should've been mindin' my business
Now I'm wit somebody else and you wit somebody else
See why it gotta be like this, when you should've been right here huh
Hit my Facebook or my Instagram when you need somethin' Where da heart's at that's where the home is so that other shit don't really mean nothin'

[Chorus: Ball Greezy]
In my mind, you'll always be my baby
In my mind, you'll always be my girl
In my mind, you'll always be my baby
In my mind, you'll always be my girl
Oooh, this is why I love you
This is why I love you
Cause you love me
Cause you love me

[Verse 2: Trina]
Yeah, uh, Trina
Love don't love nobody, cause remember I thought you'd be forever
No matter all lies all tries, late night cries, so I put the knife in the leather
Fucked up the crib, fuck you letter
Low self esteem, I deserve much better
How the fuck this nigga thinkin' he must've been drinkin' don't he know he fucked up forever
Ha, who, me, shit I'ma bad bitch
Ion I chase 'em, I replace 'em, been centerfold headliner and shit and this bitch super confident
Ha, I ain't hittin' up your Facebook or your Instagram, I don't need nothin', cause my heart ain't where yo home is, cause that shit you pulled meant everything

[Chorus: Ball Greezy]
In my mind, you'll always be my baby
In my mind, you'll always be my girl
In my mind, you'll always be my baby
In my mind, you'll always be my girl
Oooh, this is why I love you
This is why I love you
Cause you love me
Cause you love me
