[Intro]
I feel like I'm by myself
I feel like I'm by myself
I'm here, I'm so alone

[Chorus]
Every time I turn around, I see your face boy
I wish I was by myself
Said I wish I was by myself
I don't need you no, no more

Every time I turn around, I see your face boy
I wish I was by myself
Said I wish I was by myself
No pain, no more, no more

[Verse 1]
All my tears and all my cryin'
Nothin' is change cause you still lyin'
What you're sellin' I'm not buyin'
Don't you stop me, I'm ready to go
I don't need your circumstances
I'll just leave it, take my chances
Tired of playin' in fake romances
Don't you stop me, I'm ready to go

[Pre-Chorus]
You said that you'll be forever truly
How you lied so clearly
You can start over but you won't be near me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now put yourself in my position, I'm a late night trickin'
While you home cookin', I went my dog's right n' lookin'
Oh we in the strip club throwin' up dozens
When you ask me for some cash, I'm lookin' at you funny
I ain't got no money, baby I'm broken
I can do you how I wanna cause I pay your card [?]
Remember I've given you the check, I'm the nigga
I got friends, so whatever
Understand that your better

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]
