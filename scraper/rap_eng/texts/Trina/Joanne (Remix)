1 - Joanne, Joanne
Stop trying to be my friend
Joanne, Joanne
Stop trying to freak my man
Joanne, Joanne
How you gon' try to clown
Joanne
I know you got another plan
When I'm not around

For most of our lives
It's been you and me
And I always thought
Nothing could come between
Obviously our friendship doesn't mean nothing to you
All this time I though I knew you, oh

2 - [Trina & Tamera]
Half shirts, mini skirts
All of that ain't gon' work
So stop trying to flirt with my man
Before someone gets hurt

Repeat 1

We were so close
How could you hurt me
You were my best friend
Where's your honesty
Thought you had my back
But that ain't where you at
See right through you
All this time I thought I knew you

Repeat 2
Repeat 1

No way you could fool me
When he loves me truly
I can't believe I once called you a friend
Jo-Jo-Anne

[Eve]
I'm not the bitch to be tried
No remind, I'm makin' 'em cry
Cross the line with my property I'm walkin' up out
Treated you like a sister and you played games
Had to pull out the gangster showing you I'm running things
And I'm naming names
Practically raised you and made you
Classier than most know now I should have caved you
You thought he paged you, SURPRISE!
Heard me on the line
He told me everything about how you wasted his time and
How I cheated when I didn't
If it was given couldn't handle my position
Use your woman's intuition
Pick of the litter
Never compared, never could make me bitter
Compared to you I'll always be the bigger picture
Trying to be Eve, can never have it, act right
Four search parties be looking for you with a flashlight

[Trina]
No, Jo-Jo

Repeat 1 till end
