Yo, yo, yo, yo baby pop lemme get on top

And if you aim to please then I won't
And I need a lot like a few g's on the spot
I want a man who ain't scared to lick
And who can handle it
Real thug keep my candle lit
So scandolous, I like it in the shower
Trembling, losing power, uh
Big spender
I want the kitty cat to purr when you climb up in her
Cause Trina want it all y'all
Big house, big yard, big six, and a big garage
Good dick and a back massage
So good make me ask for God
I want the money and the Mastercards
So we can splurge for days
Like Rick said
Give it to me, give it to me, okay
