The song right here
The song right here
Pretty rare!
Ain't no nothing petty!

Pretty light and I'm gone
X on in my phone
But tonight I'm in my zone
(Tonight I'm in my zone!)
Said he needs some attention, I don't have time
I found out he be tricky, so I'm about mine
So I'm riding, riding in that beamer
Drop top, two seat up
He care about me, so I'm stressing him either!
Probably send them diamonds
Got them bitches shining
Got the whole club watching, and I wasn't even trying
Bunch of bad bitches rocking, money in our pocket
You can hate it, you can love it
But I bet that you won't stop it!
(Hold up!)
Name is not an option, we always get it popping
When you're bad and you're bossy, you always get on top!

Chorus:
Got ‘em yelling pretty rare
I don't need your money, nigga get me head!
Swag on a million, come prepared
Good life, glam life, living in!
Ain't no nothing petty, I'm in my zone
Ain't no nothing petty, I'm in my zone
Ain't no nothing petty, I'm in my zone
Ain't no nothing petty, I'm on Patron
And I'm feeling it, pretty red
I don't need your money, nigga get me head!
Swag on a million, come prepared
Good life, glam life, living in!
Ain't no nothing petty!

I just made it rain, I'm so benevolent
Fuck the other side, they're so irrelevant, yeah
Teach you hoes a thing or two about elegance
You don't fit my standards, up your measurements
The Louis Vuitton I'm stepping in
She's basic and I'm excellence
Work hard but I make it look effortless
And that top spot is my residence!
Murder everything and leave no evidence
Them rock stars I represent
Jump up and running ever since
Got hits, baby, check my record list!
My bank roll is indefinite
That means I got no limit
My.. is so expensive and I keep them custom fitted
I'mma always go and get it
It ain't nothing about me timid
See I told them I'mma make it
And I live it cause I did it!

Chorus:
Got ‘em yelling pretty rare
I don't need your money, nigga get me head!
Swag on a million, come prepared
Good life, glam life, living in!
Ain't no nothing petty, I'm in my zone
Ain't no nothing petty, I'm in my zone
Ain't no nothing petty, I'm in my zone
Ain't no nothing petty, I'm on Patron
And I'm feeling it, pretty red
I don't need your money, nigga get me head!
Swag on a million, come prepared
Good life, glam life, living in!
Ain't no nothing petty!

I'm turned up and I'm going in
It can't be, I feel it rolling in!
They got my spot, ain't no controlling in
You're just a flock, you wasn't born to win!
Play your role, that, that ground
I got the heat, I told them back down
I keep it a hundred, don't bring your act round
Cause I'm from the street, I ain't talking rap now!
I just wanna rock, rock, I'm feeling in
I'm sinustage, I'm killing it
I'm on that piece of… I'm feeling it
Glam life, we're living it!

Chorus:
Got ‘em yelling pretty rare
I don't need your money, nigga get me head!
Swag on a million, come prepared
Good life, glam life, living in!
Ain't no nothing petty, I'm in my zone
Ain't no nothing petty, I'm in my zone
Ain't no nothing petty, I'm in my zone
Ain't no nothing petty, I'm on Patron
And I'm feeling it, pretty red
I don't need your money, nigga get me head!
Swag on a million, come prepared
Good life, glam life, living in!
Ain't no nothing petty
