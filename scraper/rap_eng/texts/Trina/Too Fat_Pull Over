[Intro]
Swiff D

[Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
From up front, I can see that back
Pull over, that ass too fat
From up front, I can see that back
Pull over, that ass too fat
Step out, we gon' do search and seizure
Hey, goddamnit girl, I need ya
And I'm the booty cop, you got me on my knees like
That's the sound of the police light, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
From up front, I can see that back
Pull over, that ass too fat
Hey, girl, you got me on my knees sayin'
That's the sound of the police light, yeah

[Verse 1: Sage the Gemini]
You know you a star
Pull up in a foreign car
I seen that from afar (yeah, yeah)
Lose my breath in awe, yeah
When I pull up on ya, please get in the car
I see it, I need it, I get it
You have it, you know I'm an addict
I feel like I'm Aladdin
You gon' get it with a savage
Pass it backwards, Madden
Girl, I'll throw it backwards
For that high fashion
Diamonds go platinum

[Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
From up front, I can see that back
Pull over, that ass too fat
From up front, I can see that back
Pull over, that ass too fat
Step out, we gon' do search and seizure
Hey, goddamnit girl, I need ya
And I'm the booty cop, you got me on my knees like
That's the sound of the police light, yeah

[Verse 2: Trina]
Yeah, Trina
You can see me from afar
I make you drop like a foreign star
I could make you clap like a crashin' car
Lips get wet for the caviar
Better have a bank account that's up to par
To get these cookies up out the jar
You go' be right back here tomorrow
Tell 'em I'm lookin' for the big kahuna
And when you find him, tell him bring the jeweler
Bring out the ice to save the cooler
Making that pop like crip the ruler
Making that wet like crip to rule her
Write up the check to me on the tour
Italy, France
(I'd like to order five burgundy Lamborghinis)
Ain't none of these girls the baddest
The any made one and I'm a fuckin' savage
I'll throw these hoes, eat 'em like a sandwich
Ass still fat, I'm a fuckin' classic
Ass still fat, I'm a fuckin' savage
Throw a bitch in, then close the casket
Step on the gas, I mashed it
Another crime scene, it's so fuckin' tragic, yeah

[Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
From up front, I can see that back
Pull over, that ass too fat
From up front, I can see that back
Pull over, that ass too fat
Step out, we gon' do search and seizure
Hey, goddamnit girl, I need ya
And I'm the booty cop, you got me on my knees like
That's the sound of the police light, yeah
