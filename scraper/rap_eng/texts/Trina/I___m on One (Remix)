[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it, I’m on one
Yeah, I said, "I’m on one", fuck it, I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said, "Fuck it, I’m on one"

[Verse: Trina]
Yeah, uh-huh, Trina, Trina
I'm on one, it's time to make it two
I'm still the baddest bitch out, hoe face the truth
Doin' the dollar in the coupe and it's baby blue
Men salute 'cause I got more stripes than beetle juice
Millionaire girls club, we the crew (MGC)
We make seven digit moves while you bitches snooze
Every single thing I do, shit, make the news
Fort tough, can't break the unbreakable
You celebratin' in here, you Rosé'in
Hella kush, we got that in rotation
Undisclosed location, we party hard
Go HAM in this bitch like it's Mardi Gras
Yeah, you know the camp thing, I do the damn thing
Got a case of bottles and it's all full of champagne
You know the public trade, bitch, yeah, I'm on one
Paid my dues, tell them bitches I don't owe 'em nothin'

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it, I’m on one
Yeah, I said, "I’m on one", fuck it, I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said, "Fuck it, I’m on one"
