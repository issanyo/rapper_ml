Uh, baddest bitch, on the mic, check it
Digga, Digga in the house, uh, uh
Slip-N-Slide y'all
Who you know could flip their thang with whips and chains
In the penthouse suite a back seat a deranged
You lookin for a real chick I'm the one for ya
Lay you down on my Versace comforter
Get straight down to it, no time to tease ya
Get this thang off the chain boy you know the procedure
Make ya body shake like you having a seizure
Ain't now chick sweeter than the don diva
Material girl like Madonna
Da Baddest Bitch, the primadonna
I'm the Venus Williams of this rap thang
Teaching these lame chicks how to work the stack game
Fuck the diamond in the rough I'm flawless
Head to toe, Donatella we ballers
Bad girls what they call us
Two type, Slip-N-Slide and Flipmode we gettin loose right
Uh, aha, uh, fuck y'all wanna do
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Diamonds on our wrist
Sunroof top
Chillin on the scene
With the gangsta queens
Nahmean? Nahmean?
Diamonds on our neck
No roof drop
Chillin on the scene
With the gangsta queens
Nahmean? Nahmean?

Lil' thing where ya ? change

Got glitter fingernails with the mink ??
Loving Cristal sips on the pink ??
The one that keeps the toes hittin

A little foreshot when or where my clothes fit in
Anything else at the tight of my belt
Type of rhymes in the club have you fighting yourself
The daughter, rich porter gotta rap this order
All of y'all would be fucked if I was robbin this quarter

Diamonds on our wrist
Sunroof top
Chillin on the scene
With the gangsta queens
Nahmean? Nahmean?
Diamonds on our neck
No roof drop
Chillin on the scene
With the gangsta queens
Nahmean? Nahmean?
