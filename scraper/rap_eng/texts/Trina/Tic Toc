[Intro: French Montana & Trina]
Trina
Haah (French) Montana (yea)
I'mma I'mma (talk about it)

[Hook: French Montana]
Shorty ass fat with a attitude
Yea baby, I ain't mad at you
Watch a young nigga ball
You know I'm getting money like a clock on the wall
Talking tic (tic) toc (toc) tic (tic) toc (toc)
Tic tic toc, bitch tic toc
Shorty ass fat with a attitude
Go ahead baby, I ain't mad at you

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Pull up in the club, it's a bloody murda
Rock that shit niggas never heard of
We done killed the game, go and dig the dirt up
Coke boys were everything you learned about
30 racks, make em rain dance
I rock 60 racks on every hand
Pull up in that shit, bitches yelling hello
Hottest in my city, I'll be balling like 'Melo
We be smoking on that killa
My garage like a dealer
Pull up in that shit, bitches ask what you call that?
All that fly shit we done wore that, Montana

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trina]
Yeah, uh-huh
My pussy worth a small fortune
Put him in the matrix when I slow motion
Ass so fat he need a lap dance
These other hoes belong in the trash can
You broke niggas, you can keep you 2 cents
When I throw it back caught this nigga speaking French
He pray before he eat it, pussy heaven sent
You ain't breaking bread boy, you got me bent
You know my name (you know my name) Miss Trina
Baddest bitch aka bread winner
I'm in the club, bad bitches round me
You can find me down in Dade County

[Hook]

[Outro: Trina]
Yeah, Trina
Baddest bitch, French
Keep ticking bitch
Get your time piece up, bum bitches
Some new shit, French Montana
The baddest bitch, 305
Dade County
Fuck all you other bitches
Yeah I said it, yeah
Coke boys, uh-huh
Stop your game up niggas

[Hook]
