[Spoken word intro: Trina]
Why y'all hoes so jealous?  I just wanna know why y'all hoes so jealous?  Why y'all punk-ass hoes can't get out here, do what y'all do, get your own muthafuckin' money!  Get your own money, put your own music out, do what the fuck you wanna do!  Why y'all hoes hatin' on me, bitch, I been doin' this shit 17 years grindin!  Ain't none of y'all punk-ass hoes gave me shit!  Ain't no nigga gave me shit, ain't nobody gave me shit!

*SHORYUKEN!*
A-audio!

[Hook: Trina]
They say I fell off, what the fuck you think? (What the fuck you think?)
Last time I checked, I had it in the bank! (Had it in the bank!)
Addicted to the money, it's a habit! (It's a habit!)
Trill bitch, livin' so savage!
They say I fell off, what the fuck you think? (What the fuck you think?)
Last time I checked, I had it in the bank! (Had it in the bank!)
Addicted to the money, it's a habit! (It's a habit!)
Trill bitch, livin' so savage!

[Verse 1: Trina]
Fell off? Never!
Too much equity (Too much equity)
Too much leverage, fuck your reference, I co-sign me (I co-sign me)
Hit the block, blow the top, guess who playin' me?
17 years in this bitch, now that's a major key! (That's a major key!)
I come back, then go, come back, then go
Seen a lot of bitches tried to try it, they ain't hittin' no 'mo
I come back, then go, come back, then go
I swear this shit sweet, I swear it's a revolvin' door!
Last time I checked, I'm the only bitch to close shop
Do about 50 on the table, talkin' close shop
All these fresh designers in my bag, finna clothes-shop
Last time I checked, I'm the bitch with the biggest rock!

[Verse 2: Da Brat]
They said when I came home, I wasn't gon' be shit, fuck you think?
I'm on major networks, radio, four TV shows, gettin' it, fuck you think?
You see me and I don't say shit to you, it's 'cause I'm in a zone
Mind on my money, gettin' money on my phone!
So cash it, that there deposit
No if, ands or buts about it!
Don't give fuck about a mafia, if it's a stick-up I pick up and drop ya
Pick up the bag, the pistol will pump on my lap to pop ya!
So stop it, ain't shit in life free, and you don't get no bargain
And ain't no bargainin' when you callin' in tryin' to book me
So get out yo' feelin's, I'm tryin' to cop them millions, I'm tryin' to buy them buildings
I'm not at all with the negative vibe, I'm only tryin' to get that paper, raise that price, day and night!
Fuck you think?
I'm home now (Home now)
And I'm the shit, bitch, fuck you think?
Ain't goin' nowhere (Ain't goin' nowhere)
I been here (I been here)
I'm the past, present, future and I'm errwhere!
(laughing)
Fuck you think?
Yeah, Trina!
