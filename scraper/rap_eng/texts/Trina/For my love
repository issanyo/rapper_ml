[Intro]
The things you do, girl
For my lovin', for my love

[Verse 1: Wayne Wonder]
She would cheat on her man with me
At the time just to get all my love
Take a vacation girl
You know my location
Just to get some of my love
Fly to Jamaica cause she love me art flavor
Cause she can't get sick of my love
When I'm given her the touch
She caught me in a rush
She pourin' into my love

[Hook]
The things you do, girl
For my lovin', for my love
The things you do, girl
For my lovin', for my love
For my lovin'

[Verse 2: Trina]
VP perfume on my wrists
Trips from Miami down to Atlantis
Chris, make me wonder why my body like this
I want you to myself, I guess I'm so selfish
The queen with the crown
Drop it to the ground
Pop the Rozay
And turn it upside down
When you look me in me eyes
And you grind on me thighs
Make my blood pressurize
Say, she just the right size
Wayne Wonder sing

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trina]
I know what you want
I got what you need
I'm a beast in the bed
But a lady in the streets
I know a little spot
Where the beach is the bluest
Baby, we could do this
And carpul sayin' Lucas
You know what I'm about
Now show me what you got
I party like a rock star
On the deck of the yacht
We could sail on the seas
Make a stop in belize
If you got Trina what else do you need?
Wayne Wonder sing

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Wayne Wonder]
She would give her man bun
Just because I'm more fun
So she keep coming back for my love
From she get a push
She pours her emotions
Excessive morn for my love
Deep in her thoughts
She get lost
Thinking about my love
Even if she get puss
Just because I get floss
Still gonna press for my love

[Hook]
