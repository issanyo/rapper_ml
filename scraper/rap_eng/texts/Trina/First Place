Rockstar Music

Niggas stop when I walk through
A 100K when I walk through
This elite shit five hundred fortune
Corporate talk I don't know you

All my life I been bad hoe
Plenty sex in that ben (?) though
Got multiple strings of income
Yeah bitch i know i could buy you

Get slick you off and then buy you
Deposits all through that drive through
Now what the fuck you gonna do now?
My album out they won't buy you

Six, I done came with the hits
Now the fiends gotta (?), all the broke shit fixed
I done came with the hits, now welcome the six

Ive been brainstorming on (?) global warming
Bitch you know I'm hot as ever
Bloods love me, Crips love me
Bitch I'm like some iron leather

None of these hoes can't grow in the hood
All them hoes get no respect
I'm well connected, I never be broke
And I'm always gon' get me a cheque

I flex up and down
Must B&C(?) that crown hoe
This 305 in this bitch, that home of survival
(?) said I was a rockstar, and ain't no hoe gon' check me
Cos I make that thing go blah *gunshot*
Gon be hard for the world to forget me

I'm  the bitch they talking about
That main bitch from the story
I'm that bitch doing victory laps
No nuts, no glory

6, now I'm back with the hits
Now the fiends gotta (?), all the broke shits fixed
Now I'm back with the hits, now welcome the 6

All my life I been bad hoe
All my life I been bad hoe
All my life I been bad hoe
