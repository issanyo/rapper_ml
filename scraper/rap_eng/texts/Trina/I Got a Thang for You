(feat. Keyshia Cole)

(Yeah)
Ladies, (Yeah)
Have you eva had a thang for somebody
And it was just so deep
And you wanted to tell him so bad
But you just couldn't find the words?
Listen...

(Chorus: Keyshia Cole)
I gotta thang for you baby you know
Don't wanna take it slow
I wanna get to know ya
Don't wanna play no games, listen to what Im sayin
I gotta thang for you
(For you)

I gotta thang for you baby you know
Don't wanna take it slow
I wanna get to know ya
Don't wanna play no games, listen to what Im sayin
I gotta thang for you
Baby you know

(Verse 1: Trina)
I gotta thang for you and it hurts me
Cause Im holdin back im so thirsty
When I open wide, you betta work inside
But promise that you won't hurt me wit
(Here we go, here we go again)
Cause I ain't got time for lies
This time ain't lookin (for a friend)

I need a man thats gon wine & dine me
Everytime you look you find me
Bellhoppin he buyin me
And plus he all mine see
He Brad Pitt, im Jolie
When we together we always sing
(K-I-S-S-I-N-G)
I gotta thang for you so how you feel bout me?
Ahh...

(Chorus: Keyshia Cole)
I gotta thang for you baby you know
Don't wanna take it slow
I wanna get to know ya
Don't wanna play no games, listen to what Im sayin
I gotta thang for you

I gotta thang for you baby you know
Don't wanna take it slow
I wanna get to know ya
Don't wanna play no games, listen to what Im sayin
I gotta thang for you
Baby you know

(Verse 2: Trina)
Damn you got me wide open
And I know you sayin that im jokin
Cause tha boys in tha past, they just couldn't last
But for some reason I think u been chosen
(Heaven sent, don't wanna walk away)
Just hold me tightly up in you arms
And tell me (everyday)

That you ain't neva gon leave me heartbroke
Promise to give a good long stroke
Boy this forreal and this ain't no joke
Thought I was dreamin but I kno im woke
What you done did that got me so gone
Feels so right that this can't be wrong
Hangin up and right back callin yo phone
Cause I go crazy when I hear ya voice tone...
Ahh...

(Bridge: Keyshia Cole)
And you know...
I can't wait to see your face again
(Again boy)
And you know...
Im hopin we can work this thing out
Everytime that Im alone
Im thinkin bout us and where we could be
Thats how I kno I gotta a thang
For you baby, yeah you know

(Chorus: Keyshia Cole)
I gotta thang for you baby you know
Don't wanna take it slow
I wanna get to know ya (Wanna get to kno you)
Don't wanna play no games, listen to what Im sayin (boy listen to what Im sayin)
I gotta thang for you (Hey)

I gotta thang for you baby you know
Don't wanna take it slow (yeah)
I wanna get to know ya
Don't wanna play no games, listen to what Im sayin
I gotta thang for you
Baby you know

The way you love me, the way you love me
The way you touch me, the way you touch me
The way you love me, the way you love me
The way you touch me, the way you touch me
