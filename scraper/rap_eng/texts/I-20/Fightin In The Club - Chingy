And you probably gon run when the girls screamin "i thought i seen a gun"
They yellin that they fightin in tha club
Got people doing stunts got people rolling blunts
Got people in the ring got people that have sense
You need to stay low till you get out this building
Bursting everything even ya enemy
Niggas swinging pool sticks niggas throwing pool balls
Got niggas throwing bottles and got them throwing them all
