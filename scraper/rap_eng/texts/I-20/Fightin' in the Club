[Verse 1: I-20]

Niggas talkin' this and that and wonder what I signed for
Oh, now you hatin' DTP, cause we got the game sold
Bottom line, you gotta problem, tell it to my 9, ho
Fuck ya boy, hit somebody, swing until a nigga dead
Chingy make her chicken-head, tell that chick to give me head
You can tie tonight dawg, Get em', peel em' roll on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
It's a chair over there and a bottle on the left
And nobody playin' fair every man for himself
When push come to shove, shove come to push
You against us, nah us against you
All of us carry tools, lil' schooled ya whole crew

When the girls start screamin' "I thought I seen a gun"
They yellin' that "They fightin' in the club"
Yeah, got people doin' stunts
Got people blowin' blunts
Got people doing the ring
Got people with sense
You need to stay low til' you get out this building
First and everything, what about ya enemies?
Niggas swing pool-sticks, niggas throwin' pool-balls
Niggas throwin' bottles, niggas throw em' all
If I get locked up, I'mma get out tomorrow
THEY FIGHTIN' IN THE CLUB!

All I bought, had to go waste cause all us fought
We used everything it was a all out war

Hold them bustaz, buck em', bust em'
THEY FIGHTIN' IN THE CLUB!

[Hook]
