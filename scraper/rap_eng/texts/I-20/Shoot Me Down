[Verse 1]
I’m higher than you
That’s how I feel
I know this is rude
But that’s how it is
I’m young in the game
They don’t like that idea
They wish I would stop
They wish I’d disappear
No, no way never
I don’t think I’ll ever give up
Instead of letting anybody down
I’d rather live up
To the bar that I set
If I try no regret
Any battle I can win
Put my mind to the test
I was chosen
Head first you just put your toes in
Open the game up why you closing

I’m so high top gun don’t shoot me down
You on the Forbes so high why don’t you…Su

[Hook]
Please don't shoot me down (x6)

[Verse 2]
They just want to shoot me down like a SCUD missile
Cuz they see I’m high, good bud twistin’
Chillin, Heartbreakers and we in the buildin’
Give me my medicine no penicillin
I just wanna chill but everybody’s trippin
I just wanna be in a world where everybody’s lifted
My whole my mind is different, young black and gifted
And you got me twisted, I took the game and flipped it yeah
I’m just a homeboy from outer space, maybe that’s why I feel so out of place
In the league, record speed, this is our race
Poppin’ wheelies as I’m laughing in you cowards’ face
I live for this, I die for this, this life is for me I’m confident

We are the best on the continent and I’ll never owe you old presidents…
