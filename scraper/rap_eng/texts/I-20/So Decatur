(*I-20 - Talking*)
Eastside .. Eastside hoe this our anthem
Yo killa's here, I-20 let's run niggas

[Chorus]
I'm so Decatur
I'm so Decatur
I'm so Decatur
I'm so Decatur

[Verse]
Dealer got the coke for all the snorters and the shooters
If I say they online, I ain't talkin' 'bout computers
D.E.C. Eastside hoe we back on the grind
If I'm in the trap I like to pack a mack or a 9
In '94 I'm sellin' bass, in a place called spanish trace
In a second you can vanish, dead and gon' without a trace
I caught my first case, for boomin' out the back of south deca'
Man I wouldn't be caught there without a Z atleast a half
Shit I had to be fresh, they had the T's on friday night's
And if the car ain't got no shoes, I can't say I'm ridin' right
I had this trick, out in Eastwick, who turn tricks and suck dick
And when I went to see her, I would always have a full clip
Scottdale bitch, one been through some rappin' lands
Mr. Coug' a damn shame, call the twins from jagged edge
And I will rep the D.E.C., til' it ain't no breath in me
Whether Glenwood, Rainbow, Flexo's or Macavee see...

[Chorus]
I'm so Decatur
I'm so Decatur
I'm so Decatur
I'm so Decatur

[Verse]
Yeah, I talk that dope slang folk, rock and dust
Treat my hoes like my pistols, cock and bust
You better study hip-hop, if you think someone else
Could spit the game so trill and get they shit off the shelf
Niggas think they so fire, well I'ma full alarm blaze
Set ya braids on fire, til' they burn to a fade
This that eastside shit dog, let it be known
And our hands in all the car folk, nothin' but chrome
It's all stuntin' in the Dec. dog that's rule #1
Ya see more niggas touchin' rims then a game of 21
And I'm so slum with it, my roots are du' deep
I'm so street if I get shot I'd probably bleed concrete
Take a second, swallow what you heard
Try to understand while they follow every word
While they put me on a pedastile and worship what I say
I-Dub out that eastside and this is how we pray, say ugnhh!

[Chorus]
I'm so Decatur
I'm so Decatur
I'm so Decatur
I'm so Decatur

[Verse]
I-Double, I'm straight out the Dec., no one is better
Niggas claim I changed my style, but I only changed the letters
From BMX to BMW, AK's to MP's
.OZ's to ASCAP, the BUS to SUV's
Bitch please, I'm from Atlanta where we brawl and we fight
When you ever heard me rhyme and it was only aiight
I ain't shit, but I'am the shit, you do the math
This ain't a clip, it's a full clip, move or get blast
The only one that could be king, cause I do it for real
Don't believe me we can hit the deck and do it for real
Pretty thugstyle, got these bitches kissin' us off
Fake rappers sound like bad blaoww's, pissin' me off
Infamous, I'ma icon, ain't no endin' me
Call Chaka all you want, and you still won't be D.T.P
Basically y'all faggots, cause you do it and run
Ain't no killa's on the payroll cause we do it for fun, folk

[Chorus]
I'm so Decatur
I'm so Decatur
I'm so Decatur
I'm so Decatur
