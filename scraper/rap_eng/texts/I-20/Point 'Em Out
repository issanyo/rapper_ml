Hell, let u all hear it
I love it when the bar dropping get low wit' it
The eight-eye-style i'm so sick with it
A fresh white tea, an a new break with it
Make it back side bottle like it ain't no to mo'
I love it with her, an' i hope she swallow
The most get a choosin' when i hit a club scene
To old motherf**ker, i'm a doup bitch scream
Please let me tap bro, i want see if it's workin'
It's rap u know from, so i ain't here to survin'
If u really want ur life change listen to me because
I'm leavin' in a minute, now u leavin' wit' me

How u really want this money point 'em out then..
An' if she dinaide do it to me point 'em out then..
An' if she really is a f**kin' point 'em out then..
An' if she really is a suckin' point 'em out then..

Point 'em out then..

Point 'em out then..
Point 'em out then..
If she a bad bitch here point 'em out then..
