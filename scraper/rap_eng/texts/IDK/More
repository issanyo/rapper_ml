[Intro: Jay IDK]
I’m so high
Right now
That I feel like if I look down I might
Pass out
Marijuana has taken over my mind
Some how
Forget my actions and thoughts
Worries are gone
Priorities are lost
And I ain't trying to come down

[Verse 1: Jay IDK]
Uh
So then I mix that with a little bit of Hennessey
It got me hung like civil rights in Tennessee
I can’t walk I can’t move I can’t breathe
And everything is blurry, I can barely see
But that’s the feeling and the mood that I’m looking for
The reason why I ain’t afraid to approach these hoes
The reason why when I wasn’t gone I ain't dance at all
Now I’m doing the running man praying I don’t fall

[Pre-Hook: Jay IDK]
Put your swishers to the sky if you
Feelin alive and you
Livin’ the life of a stoner
And for the people that hate marijuana, we tell em
“I'm in college man, this ain't contraband
This shit is normal”

[Hook: Jay IDK]
I inhale then I exhale
Pass the swisher to the left then I rest
I grab another from the right then I light
Ash hit it one more time, now I'm high
Then do it again
Inhale then I exhale
Pass the swisher to the left then I rest
Grab another from the right then I light
Ash hit it one more time, now I'm high
Then do it again

[Verse 2: Jay IDK]
9th grades when I had my first J
I went to school gone off the Kush or the haze
I swore I'd never smoke but that shit quickly changed
When I started listening to Gucci Mane and Wayne
To me it seemed
Like um
The thing to do so I rolled up the gas and inhaled the fuels
That was back when all my niggas use to wear the trues
We were young so we couldn't even cop the brew
Until fuckin’ with white boys at UMD
Got me getting drunker than the crowd in UFC
I was drinking liquor at the age of 18
Now I'm always sipping vodka no chasing

[Pre-Hook: Jay IDK]
Bottles to the sky if you feelin alive and you
Livin the life of a stoner
And for the people that hate marijuana, We tell em
“I’m in college man, this ain't contraband
This shit is normal”

[Hook]

[Bridge: JaVonte]
I need more, some more
I gotta find, some more
I need more, some more
I gotta find, some more

[Verse 3: Jay IDK]
Sex, eating, listening to music is alright
But all of the above is even better when you are (high)
Drunk or off the Molly I'm sorry but it's the truth, we young
We havin fun, it ain't really nothing to lose ‘cept
Like um, a few brain cells
But it don't matter cause by the time I graduate, I'll be well
Stop the pills in a year
No more weed in probably five
These drugs are not addictive, the addiction’s in your mind
Anything you just mentally need
Often means the need for that thing can be seized
So when you want to stop, just make sure that you believe
And it will be over before you say the word “weed”

[Pre-Hook: Jay IDK]
Put your swishers to he sky if you, Feelin alive and you
Livening the life of a stoner
And for the people that love marijuana....
We tell em
