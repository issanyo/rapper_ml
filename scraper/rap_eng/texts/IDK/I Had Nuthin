[Intro]
Deko
OG Parker

[Chorus: Fijimacintosh]
I had nothin', all of the sudden
I got money, now they love me
In two seater with my bunny
Niggas hate me 'cause I'm stuntin'
You get wrapped like a mummy
Money hungry, fill my tummy, uh
She gon' arch that back and get busy with no rubber, huh
I had nothin', all of the sudden
I got money, now they love me
In two seater with my bunny
Niggas hate me 'cause I'm stuntin'
You get wrapped like a mummy
Money hungry, fill my tummy, uh
She gon' arch that back and get busy with no rubber, huh

[Verse 1: Fijimacintosh]
Sippin' that mud, come from the mud
I got a poker, give you a slug
I'm in a Rover, me and my blood
Oh, you tough? Nigga, what?
Snatch your soul out your guts
Fuck your goals and your trust
I got some niggas that's dyin' to bust
She wanna fuck but she in a rush
Most of these niggas, they weak, ooh
I spent a grip on a mink, uh
She give me top when we speak, ooh
I don't fuck, beat, huh
Feel like Billie Jean, huh
Spillin' Ciroc drink, huh
Bitch, I play for keeps, huh
Ball like Pat Free, huh

[Chorus: Fijimacintosh]
I had nothin', all of the sudden
I got money, now they love me
In two seater with my bunny
Niggas hate me 'cause I'm stuntin'
You get wrapped like a mummy
Money hungry, fill my tummy, uh
She gon' arch that back and get busy with no rubber, huh
I had nothin', all of the sudden
I got money, now they love me
In two seater with my bunny
Niggas hate me 'cause I'm stuntin'
You get wrapped like a mummy
Money hungry, fill my tummy, uh
She gon' arch that back and get busy with no rubber, huh

[Verse 2: IDK]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I got bitches, I got bitches
Big ass titties, hundreds and fifties
Come from a place where shit can get sticky
Pop up the trunk and take out the sticky
I think I'm good (I caught him, was Richy)
Them boys from the hood (This shit can get tricky)
Double barrel out the window
That shit hit you, now you Ricky
Niggas pour up, fuck, I don't fuck with the mud
But if times get rough (Rough), I might serve it like, "What's up?"
All of my serpents in the cut
Ready to snake you for all of the bucks
You just a lay-up, bitch, I am a dunk
Bodied this beat, put the shit in the trunk

[Chorus: Fijimacintosh]
I had nothin', all of the sudden
I got money, now they love me
In two seater with my bunny
Niggas hate me 'cause I'm stuntin'
You get wrapped like a mummy
Money hungry, fill my tummy, uh
She gon' arch that back and get busy with no rubber, huh
I had nothin', all of the sudden
I got money, now they love me
In two seater with my bunny
Niggas hate me 'cause I'm stuntin'
You get wrapped like a mummy
Money hungry, fill my tummy, uh
She gon' arch that back and get busy with no rubber
I had nothin', all of the sudden
I got money, now they love me
In two seater with my bunny
Niggas hate me 'cause I'm stuntin'
You get wrapped like a mummy
Money hungry, fill my tummy, uh
She gon' arch that back and get busy with no rubber, huh
