[Chorus: IDK & Q Da Fool]
I got that money flow, never stop
My long shooter click until your head pop
He in that trap and it never stop
Feds got behind me, I swear that I never stop
Stop that shit
I got a bag and you not no bitch
In Miami and I just fucked a bad lil bitch
Can't stop that shit
Look at my wrist, that’s rocks, lil bitch

[Verse 1: Q Da Fool]
I got some drip on my socks
I beat up the bags, box
Just bought the Jag with the stash spot
Can't fall in love with no damn thot, uh
My shit VVS and you still wear the silverware
My shooters ain't playin’ fair, they robbin' everywhere
Fuck on his broad, now he wanna kill me
Motherfuck the feds 'cause they still tryna jail me
Walk in the club and we turn it up
The fuck nigga tried me, got burnt up
When I come in your city my burner tucked
Shoot his ass in the face since he act so tough
I want more racks, I can't get enough
Got a hundred on stripes, we blowin' shit up
Double back with this molly, you stiff and you stuck
Bitch I'm a rich shooter, be fuckin' shit up

[Chorus]
I got that money flow, never stop
My long shooter click until your head pop
He in that trap and it never stop
Feds got behind me I swear that I never stop
Stop that shit
I got a bag and you not no bitch
In Miami and I just fucked a bad lil bitch
Can't stop that shit
Look at my wrist, that’s rocks, lil bitch

[Verse 2: IDK]
I got that money flow, never stop (Right)
They sent me deal and that shit was nah
Some niggas be snitchin’, some niggas hot (Right)
Some niggas be flippin' in with the pot
See me I’m no gangster, no lacker, no actor, no chopper
The only nigga to admit I'm a rapper
You spend your money on a bitch, I just stack up
My phone be beepin' like a truck 'bout to back up
That’s conference, y'all
Bitch I'm a boss (Right)
I got lawyers and accountants on call
I know shooters, make 'em made they gon' draw
Now your body is surrounded by chalk (Yeah)
I'm from a place where the doggy gon' bark
And if you get hit, they ain't callin' no law
But if you get caught, they ain't droppin' no charge
Have you eatin' Big Texas while rockin' the orange
Wailin' over captain, I'm from that PG, yeah
Rappin' over trappin', I made two hundred bands
If they come kick in the door (Yeah, yeah)
I don't know what happens (IDK)
I got that money flow, never stop
They sent me deal and that shit was nah
Some niggas be snitchin', some niggas hot
But ain't none of my niggas was ever locked

[Chorus]
I got that money flow, never stop
My long shooter click until your head pop
He in that trap and it never stop
Feds got behind me, I swear that I never stop
Stop that shit
I got a bag and you not no bitch
In Miami and I just fucked a bad lil bitch
Can't stop that shit
Look at my wrist, that's rocks, lil bitch
