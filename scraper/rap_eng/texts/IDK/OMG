[Intro]
Whoa, Kenny

[Chorus: IDK]
Oh my God, oh my God, what's the goddamn joke?
Gettin' money's my addiction, a goddamn drug
Only thing that I am missing's a goddamn plug
Oh my God, oh my God, what's the goddamn joke?

[Verse 1: IDK]
What's that shit? That's Y-3 (What?)
I ain't wear that shit in weeks (Yeah)
Man that shit that I am on is that shit that I can't speak
Pull up in that M-Sport, German engineering (Skrrt)
Rollie Prezi' bust down, just to match the earring
If you see I got a chain then you know I got a house
I see niggas with a chain, but they real estate a drought
How the fuck you got that bling but your credit goin' down?
Say you trappin' on the track, now them boys is all around

[Chorus: IDK]
Oh my God, oh my God, what's the goddamn joke?
Gettin' money's my addiction, a goddamn drug
Only thing that I am missing's a goddamn plug
Oh my God, oh my God, what's the goddamn joke?

[Verse 2: Wale]
Folarin
Give me loot, give me the loot
I'm a bad motherfucker
I went to school with all the goons
Nigga, my class is not in question
Special ed, I lack attention
I count my bread and mind my business
MOB, but not what y'all think
That mean music over bitches
Oh my God, I'm just sayin'
I'm focused and the boy don't play
IDK if they come for me
'Cause I'm up all night like a Fortnite player
I'm moonshine, baby, you a Coors Light beer
Court side, baby, damn near Dwight chair
Course I'm aware of the torch I carry
DMV, DMV, we're the core sum, yeah, like what?

[Chorus: IDK]
Oh my God, oh my God, what's the goddamn joke?
Gettin' money's my addiction, a goddamn drug
Only thing that I am missing's a goddamn plug
Oh my God, oh my God, what's the goddamn joke?
