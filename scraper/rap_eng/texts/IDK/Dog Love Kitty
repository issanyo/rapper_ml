[Chorus: IDK]
I'm cooling with the motherfucking gang, yuh
I'm cooling with the motherfucking gang, yuh
I'm cooling with the motherfucking gang, yuh
I'm cooling with the motherfucking gang, yuh

[Post-Chorus: Mother Marygold]
Drop down low, then pick up, pick up
Put your hands in the air, it's a stick-up, stick up
Drop down low, then pick up, pick up
Put your hands in the air, it's a stick-up, stick up

[Verse 1: IDK]
She said she want a hood nigga, aye
She ain't fuckin with them good niggas, aye
She sit it on the sink when she Snap
She said it make it look bigger
Okay I'm coming off the hit mane with the dick game
Back shots, empty clip mane, when I hip bang
And you know I never miss aim from a distance
Neck game like a six-game, that's a sick chain
Throw it back, I'll catch it but I'll never ever snatch it
'Less you want me to, that's nasty, I don't fuck with hoes that's classy
She's so flexible, gymnastics, crush that edible then ash it
Then I never call when I smash it, she like "Where you at?", I'ma answer
I'm like

[Chorus: IDK]
I'm cooling with the motherfucking gang, yuh
I'm cooling with the motherfucking gang, yuh
I'm cooling with the motherfucking gang

[Verse 2: IDK]
With the motherfucking gang
When I'm really open-zipper in a pick-up getting brain
From another bitch, that undercover shit, I'm under covers with
Another hoe, I act so motherless, I'm like "Whose butt is this?"
She said "It's mine", I'm like "It's getting big" but in reality
All I did was mix it up with feeling on some other cheeks

[Bridge: IDK]
Dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
'Fore I hit, I'm in love, when I hit, I don't call
We don't go, on no dates, we don't go to the mall
And I get it from her friends so I blame it on y'all
Said I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
'Fore I hit, I'm in love, when I hit, I don't call
We don't go, on no dates, we don't go to the mall
And I get it from my gang so I blame it on y'all
That's when I'm

[Chorus: IDK]
Cooling with the motherfucking gang, yuh
I'm cooling with the motherfucking gang, yuh
I'm cooling with the motherfucking gang, yuh
I'm cooling with the motherfucking gang
