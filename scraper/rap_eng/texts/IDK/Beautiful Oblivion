[Part 1: Beautiful]

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
I won't lie, I don't love you all the time, baby
I do sometimes but it's hard for me to find, baby

[Verse 1: Jesse Rutherford]
Put yourself down, have a little shame
Help me bring it back before we go away
We are all the same, we are all to blame
I don't need to say anybody's name
I'm the fucking archetype, I'm the alien
No, I'm not from Mars but I'm sure it's where I'll get
Our wars comin' first, Star Wars comin' next
It'll always be a mess, we were all forced to exist

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
I won't lie, I don't love you all the time, baby (I won't lie)
I do sometimes (Yeah) but it's hard for me to find, baby (Sometimes)

[Verse 2: IDK]
Yeah, look, 24/7, I be playing, shit
You call my line, I hit decline, you know I ain't shit
And ancient history told me "play the game, shawty"
Cleopatra and Nefertiti, them titties have you left for dead
But when they see me gleaming on TV, I be in they head
Don't let me put my peenie on TV, that's a lot of head
Pornstar, pornstar, might as well be
'Cause my D, he a pornstar, say hi (Hello)
I'm a stay fly (Fellow)
I don't make time for hoes, break her heart then I play my cello
Shalom, farewell, and chop, I'm in, I'm out
I hit, I'm out, I can't love with the doubt
We fight, we fuck, we fuck-fight, fight, we fuck
I think it sucks, like "Why we gotta talk so much?"
We switch it up, like we ain't gotta speak or none
We fuck, we fuck, we fuck, fuck, fuck and fuck!

[Part II: Oblivion]

[Segue: Jesse Rutherford]
Back in the day we was lay in the sun
Found out that I need a son, always had fun
Back in the day in the sun
Al- always had f- back in the

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
I don't feel the way that I used to (Anymore)
I don't ever wanna confuse you (Anymore)
We were never on the same page (Never ever)
And it might be time for a change
But what do I do if I lose you?

[Verse: Jesse Rutherford]
Do you remember when we were friends?
Nothing more than that had to last
Told me that you had my back
I said "I've got yours back
No matter what you do, no matter where you go
I'll be there to let you know, I'll be true
No matter what's at stake, I won't ever lie or fake"
We both know something's off, it's so easy to see
We know it's obvious but don't wanna believe it
Di- didn't do the best but we got there first
Huddled up together when the weather got worse
There for each other for whatever like brothers
So we gotta make it work

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
I don't feel the way that I used to (Anymore)
I don't ever wanna confuse you (Anymore)
We were never on the same page (Never ever)
And it might be time for a change
But what do I do if I lose you?

[Outro]
Jesse, Santo de Paris, I swear, I'm just sitting over here in the chairs
But I'm downstairs, I'm doing my hairs
Dude, your concert was off the chain, bro
I saw it in Brazil, it went freaking nuts
You are a freaking star
You know, dude, everybody in life has a place
And that's where your place is
In the- in the limelight, you know?
'Cause you're a freaking star, dude, let me tell ya
