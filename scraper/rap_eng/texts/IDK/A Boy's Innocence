[Hook]
The money take a boy’s innocence
The money tell the boy load the clip
The money tell him, rob him for his shits
The money tell him bang then dip

[Verse 1]
They don't understand it, they don't understand it
They ain't tryna build till they see the hammer
Nigga I got bills I can't see Havana
While you in Miami l'll be Peter Panning
Planning how I'm bout to shine like a piece of patent
Money low
On my grind gotta keep it stackin
Heat off
Cold as fuck
Light the stove with matches
Wake up, turn to Robin
Like I'm friends with Batman
Gun charges on my record I can't get 'em off
I am really not a thug, but when that money call
It make a nigga turn to something that he not at all
Rob a nigga for his shit, and leave him in his drawls

[Hook]
The money take a boy’s innocence
The money tell the boy load the clip
The money tell him, rob him for his shits
The money tell him bang then dip

[Bridge]
Grab the 4-5
Grab the new clip
Find a new lick, Blap blap blap
Grab the iPhone
Grab the wallet
If he move wrong
Blap blap blap
If you got problems
And I got problems
We gon’ solve em, Blap blap blap
Grab the 4-5
Grab the new clip
Find a new lick, Blap blap blap

[Verse 2: Jay IDK & Fat Trel]
For the gold chain they get reckless
Hit your head wit the choppa make you neckless
And if you don't respeck it, better check it
Or use hell’s gates for the exit
The money make me go a kill a copper
The money got me coppin' from a doctor
The money got me eatin' shrimp and lobsters
Suit and tie, white thot, attend the opera
Told her I want that medulla oblongata
Extra guac on my tacos, I'm talkin' gwallas
I don't issue threats, I pass a promise
So you could rock a vest, I pass a hollow
Living like we might not see tomorrow
My hood after midnight is like a horror
The money got my bitches placin' orders
Sneakin' work across the border, Sursum Corda

[Hook]
The money take a boy’s innocence
The money tell the boy load the clip
The money tell him, rob him for his shits
The money tell him bang then dip
