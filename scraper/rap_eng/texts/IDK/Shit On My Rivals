[Verse: Jay IDK]
I'm coming in your spot like a penis and her pussy on its period
After when I rhyme three times you ain't listening
Three times when I rhyme, dots after every single line
Expresses your shocked face when you stare at me
After hearing me
Punchlines make you scared of me
Raise awareness if your side-chick wasn't aware of me
Make your main chick see you as a fucking parody
And make your wife pawn her wedding ring to come and marry me
But fuck her and fuck you
F-Bomb on your daughter, your dog can get fucked too
Blowing up, hmm, I'm on your ass like a hut two
Three four, stopping it is like dodging a meteor
I'm bout to murder, like I have never heard of the fair one
Fuck your neck, I'm trying to cut your buzz like a haircut
And take at least half when I rap on a track
You's a act and you wack make the gat go BLAT
And its loaded with facts, nigga
I stay with the heat, you're just another shack nigga
Ain't talking bout teeth when I say I want the plaque, nigga
A slave before I get sold, I'm just that nigga
I'm so sick I need my name around my wrist
A drape around my bed
A motherfucking chain around my neck
A priest above my head
To pray for all the demons in my mind
They got me hypnotized
Reason for this red inside my eyes
And all this shit I buy
