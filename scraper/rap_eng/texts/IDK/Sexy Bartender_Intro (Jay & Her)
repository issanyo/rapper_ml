[Verse 1: Jay IDK]
Damn baby, you bad
At least that's what I said in my mind
At least that's I said when I seen her
Serving margaritas as if they were subpoenas
You can tell that she ain't have subpoenas
In her good meaning, her vibe
Said it all, so I figured I'd set it off
No stoney, Frankie at all
Just conversation of ours
Could put me inside her bed, if I can get in her head
But that thing was kinda hard, so I came soft instead
I asked about her interests and what she liked to do
And right to my surprise I did the same things too
Now is this a coincidence or am I falling victim to a player
AKA a man-slayer, this ain't fair, but fuck it
I'm tryna' take a risk, just like the saying
I'm proving that ignorance is bliss, shit
But I would do anything just to feel those sexy lips around my dick
I would steal bricks from Griselda Blanco's kids
And drop my I.D. inside their crib just to get a kiss
Cause she was that bad and that fat and that ass
Was in my mind, at that time I had three drinks
Had a fourth one and shit, what do you think
I spilled all the truth and all the rest that was left
Was my middle name, mother's maiden name and address
The things that I would do to get a women's address
Will be the same things a nigga do to cause him his death
Oh Lord

[Interlude: Jay IDK]
So when I first started doing music, I wanted to stay in school and kinda, y'know part time it. I was like cool and I had a local buzz or whatever, y'know nothing crazy. Then I realized this was actually a passion, I started to fall in love with it and quickly after that I realized that this shit cost money, so I had to find a way to get it

[Verse 2: Jay IDK]
Damn baby, you're so beautiful
Damn baby, you're so expensive
Damn baby, I'm tryna buy you whatever you want
Know you turn me on when you flaunt
But I'm jealous as fuck, I'm tryna buy what you require
Why you fuckin it up
You givin' all of your attention to them other rappers
But they ain't half as nice as I am
Oh I get it, they got money, they twice as trap as I am
Well fuck it, if that's what you want, I'll go and buy an onion
It ain't lucrative as coke, but it'll surely spike the budget
If my PR and my beats cost 1200
Then this 9 to 5 cuttin' hair ain't 'bout to cut it
So baby, I'ma do what I gotta do to keep you
Even if your efforts ain't guaranteed or equal
Even if I gotta compete with other people
I'll do what I do to prove how much I need
You

[Hook]
Get up, wake up
Get up, wake up
Get up, wake up
Get up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

[Bridge]
What's your addiction
Is it base, is it lean, is it bud
I'll make some batter, and mix, all of, the above
We'll call it SubTRAP
Beware, they fall, in love
This what we're missing
If you're fiendin', I'll scratch your itchin', real soon
What is you sellin'
Is it base, is it lean, is it bud
I'll give you all that
And more, for the price, of one
Sit back and kick it
Grab a blunt and light up your incent
Relax and just listen
This the shit that the world is missing
For real, for real

[Outro: Jay IDK]
So basically, to sum everything up, Subtrap is the art of trap music from another perspective. Instead of giving you one side of the fence, I'ma give you both sides with a message. Now a lot of this shit I haven't done personally, but when I was in and out of jail from 2009 to 2012, I took the time to ask questions. So a lot of the characters you're about to hear about are based off of real people that I encountered during my stay. However, if the parentheses of the back of this cover art reads "Jay", I'm speaking from the perspective of me. Hopefully by the next couple of songs, you'll be able to relate to myself, the plug, your everyday street hustler, your college weed lover, and maybe even your neighborhood crackhead and with that said I know ya'll tired of me talking, let's bring this music back in

[Bridge]
I know both sides and I'm gon' tell it like it is
I'm gon' tell it like it is
Both sides of the fence, I'm gon' tell it like it is
I'm gon' tell it like it is
I know both sides and I'm gon' tell it like it is
I'm gon' tell it like it is
Both sides of the fence, I'm gon' tell it like it is
I'm gon' tell it like it is
Kick it

[Hook]
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
