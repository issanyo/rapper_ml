[Intro: IDK]
Uhh, uhh
Uhh

[Verse 1: IDK]
Nice thighs, a little bit of butt, uhh
Those eyes ah make a nigga want you
Back shots, a blocka blocka block, uhh
Nobody shoot it like I do
You got a friend and another one
I got a friend and a friend too
You got that ass from the motherland
I got the hands that'll grip good
Too slow, too fast
Just right, like that
This ain't the time or the place to waste time
No time to waste, my hand on you
Girl keep it quiet, they tryna listen
You tryna hide it, you wanna get it
I'm gon' provide it, just let me slide it

[Chorus: IDK & Female Vocalist]
She said we got so much time for that (damn)
We got so much time for that (hol' up)
She said we got so much time for that (yeah yeah)
We got so much time for that (alright)

[Verse 2: IDK]
Uhh, go fast and we can go slow
Nobody even gotta know
You seem a little concerned
But this don't make you a hoe
You got the right to have a little fun
I finished the round to have another one
We can sweat out the negativity
We see in sync relief

[Chorus: IDK & Female Vocalist]
She said we got so much time for that (yeah yeah)
We got so much time for that (hol' up)
She said we got so much time for that (yeah yeah)
We got so much time for that (alright)

[Verse 3: IDK]
Baby I, maybe I just gotta be patient, face it
She ain't really fuckin' with the ain't shits, ain't shit
Goin' in my life but the hood shit, hood shit
She 'on't wanna swing on on a hood dick, mm
Even if it's good dick, mm
She just wanna get an education on the book shit
Word around town is I'm always tryna book shit
Maybe she don't wanna be another turned chapter in my page

[Bridge: IDK & (Female Vocalist)]
Last night, I wish I'd seen your number calling
Last night, I should've never left my phone on silent
Last night, I wish I'd seen your number calling
Last night, I should've never left my phone on silent (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Last night, I wish I'd seen your number calling (we got so much time)
Last night, I should've never left my phone on silent (we got so much time)
Last night, I wish I'd seen your number calling (we got so much time)
Last night, I should've never left my phone on silent (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Outro: Female Vocalist & IDK]
I want you to fuck me on the floor, we can do it on the bed
We can keep it on the low, we can tell the world instead
We can get it, get it, get it, get it
We can get it, get it, get it, get it
I want you to fuck me on the floor, we can do it on the bed
We can keep it on the low, we can tell the world instead
We can get it, get it, get it, get it
We can get it, get it, get it, get it
I want you to fuck me on the floor, we can do it on the bed
We can keep it on the low, we can tell the world instead
We can get it, get it, get it, get it
We can get it, get it, get it, get it
I want you to fuck me on the floor, we can do it on the bed
We can keep it on the low, we can tell the world instead
We can get it, get it, get it, get it (this that, this that, this that, this that)
We can get it, get it, get it, get it (this that, this that, this that, this that)
