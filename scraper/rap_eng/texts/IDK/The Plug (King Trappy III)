[Intro]
Trap, lil nigga, trap
Trap, lil nigga, trap
Trap, lil nigga, trap
Trap, lil nigga, trap
Trap, lil nigga, trap (Birds)
Trap, lil nigga, trap (Birds)
Trap, lil nigga, trap (Cuckoo)
Trap, lil nigga, trap

[Verse 1]
All these niggas wonder why when I say
The Reagan Era put a motherfucking voice in my head
Saying, "Trap, lil nigga, trap"
So I'm on the block with my Glock cocked till my heart stop
Fuck blood, rather pump crack
Or go get a tre-five and flip it for five five
Why you motherfuckers flipping burgers at five guys?
For lack of words, the lies that lie inside of ya mind
Every single time make a nigga feel fine
The reason why I'm blind when I see my people die
The messed up part's that they see it as a crime
It might be death, but I see it as a dime
And that shit makes sense, ain't no need to ask why, fuck it
All I'm tryna do is stay clear of the buckets
Driving this dope, got me scooping up the duckets
A lot of rappers rap about trap shit
But they ain't really 'bout shit
I'm the only one that's saying something
Fronting's equivalent to whippings on the back
When your front's getting whiped in the kitchen
And the Feds run up to the door, get to kickin' with the strap
To your hat, make you lay down flat, that's a fact
The plug ain't me, the plug is a story of how society bleeds
Part of the popular phrase that says
I can't breath, I can't breath
I can't breath, I can't breath

[Interlude]
Lord, Lord
When I, when I

[Pre-Hook]
When I hop up out the Porsche or out the Lamb'
That become my wrist juggie juggie, flip, juggie juggie, damn
My shotta got a Glocka, it go ham
All because my wrist juggie juggie, flip, juggie juggie, damn

[Hook]
I'm the plug (Birds)
I'm the plug, I'm the plug
I'm the plug (Birds)
I'm the plug, I'm the plug
I'm the plug (Cuckoo)
I'm the plug, I'm the plug
I'm the plug (You ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home)
I'm the plug, I'm the plug

[Verse 2]
Extendo clip (Clip, clop), bang, bang!
Leave a nigga on the floor, let his brains hang
What's those pants? Alexander Wang
Buy new clothes everytime I sell a whole thang
Moving that coca and I ain't talking 'bout butter
I leave it to my young niggas, they gon' cook it and cut up
They take it back to the block, they break it down, make it pop
Trapping is not like selling records, it is not gonna flop
Touch my mans and get dropped, touch my fam and get popped
Touch my stash and I'm clickin', clockin', reload and then flock
(Brrrrrrrrrrrrrr) I ain't never had a damn day job, nigga
I been getting paid since tenth grade, nigga
Never been in Feds but I make seven figures
That's the reason why these niggas wanna hate, go figure

[Pre-Hook]
Hop up out the Porsche or out the Lamb'
That become my wrist juggie juggie, flip, juggie juggie, damn
My shotta got a Glocka, it go ham
All because my wrist juggie juggie, flip, juggie juggie, damn

[Hook]
I'm the plug (Birds)
I'm the plug, I'm the plug
I'm the plug (Birds)
I'm the plug, I'm the plug
I'm the plug (Cuckoo)
I'm the plug, I'm the plug
I'm the plug (You ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home)
I'm the plug, I'm the plug
