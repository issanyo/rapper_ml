[Verse 1: Jay IDK]
Smokin' on the sticky of the finest got me sittin' on a island
Chillin' with a picket sign while screaming peace and fuck the violence
I'm on cloud nine (yeah) its about time (yeah) to about face and face reality, one more game
Cause the high is gone now, the light to life is on now
It's shining on all of my problems, time solve 'em, that's ironic
Cause the lack of chronic causes me to vomit
Anything that doesn't lead to graduating with the honors, honestly I'd rather not
But I gotta find a way to fix society cause if I don't who's gonna hire me?
And that's the irony, it causes me to let off all this steam like I was ironing
Ironically, the shit I'm sparking be the shit that's haunting me
But there's no way that I can cope with life without my bong of weed

[Hook] x 2
I'm outta my mind I can feel the vibe (yeah)
I'm outta my mind I can feel the vibe (yeah)
You outta your mind can you feel it all

[Verse 2: Jay IDK]
After all my classes and my lectures I create a new elective
Cause this weed I was smoking is a potent psychedelic
Seems the way to go (oh)
I place it on my tongue and close my eyes, open them up
Now everything is, ah shit
Now I'm seeing other types of being, other types of meaning
Damn the world isn't what it seems
What the fuck are dreams if you do the opposite
I'd like to be a doctor for the proper fix
But the beamers aren't worth the femurs I'mma have to fix
That ain't my passion
My life is lacking what I have to get
I'd rather paint a brighter picture for the youth and kids
But that only makes me thirty thousand
And my parents pissed out of being slaves to the way life proceed to be
Which is basically saying be the opposite of me
I'mma have to eat another shroom
Take some LSD, THC ain't working for me
Fuck this bong of weed

[Hook] x 2
I'm outta my mind I can feel the vibe (yeah)
I'm outta my mind I can feel the vibe (yeah)
You outta your mind can you feel it all

[Outro]
I'm outta my mind
I'm screaming fuck it, fuck it
Do a lot of drugs!
