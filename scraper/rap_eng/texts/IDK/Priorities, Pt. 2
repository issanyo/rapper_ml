[Verse]
I used to work at the barber shop
The only place that would hire whenever I came from lock
Yup, the only place that would inspire me to be all that I could be without wielding a weapon wearin camo with the green
Only thing is that the money made comes after the scene
So it's hard to cut a head when you're headed towards dream
Especially when your fans cheerin' for you like Ali
See you in the bathroom and go crazy like Prince Hakeem
But my bills ain't tryna hear that
Life seems to fear that
Music puts a whole in my brain where the kids at
It's like me and music playing games where the cheers at
Too late, I don't see em man I'm always in the chair last
I'm always loosing, I'm never winning at least not within
And from the outside you see a smile but I'm pitting
I'm tryna hide the feeling of feeling like I threw my life away
Then I hear that same voice once again

[Bridge]
Lil' Nigga
I'm always feeling lonely when I'm with ya
Everybody else is phoney or they switched up
Service sucks that's why they never get the picture
Lil' Nigga, lil' nigga
I'm always feeling lonely when I'm with ya
Everybody either phoney or they switched up
That's the type of shit that make me wanna give up
So I give up

[Hook]
Ay, I just got paid and I got a little money to burn, to burn
Say, I'm tryna get laid tryna find me a sexy girl, a girl
My, priorities fucked up I don't really care though
Soft lips, tough luck, I don't really care though
Big dreams, small hope
I don't really care though, I don't really care though
No no
