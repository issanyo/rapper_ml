[Verse 1]

Check
I’m a rapper that can make a fuckin’ record
Then turn around and break a fuckin’ record
For the best MC that ever set foot
In the seven seas
Since the 70s you ain’t seen dope like me
I got the kinda style that make your little
Thottie wanna leave
She only sweating on you because you boost her self-esteem
She always come to me
To knock the boots up off her cheeks
But everytime I fuck her I be saying Angelique
When her name is really
Patrice or something
It don’t matter
It just means
That when you fuck
She a good actor
But everytime I fuck she get up and just cook after
She Sandra Lee a nigga
’Cause she want me be her nigga
But I’m too busy overseas collecting G’s nigga

Life of a Don
Lights keep fucking up my eyes from my arm
This Presidential
Looking like a goddamn collage
Of lights
That attract broads like flies
Better get your girl
I might shock your wife
Buzz

’Cause I’m buzzing like front doors
My front four’s filled with karats
Your front’s forged
My clout go for miles and miles
I run Forrest
Is this the game?
I’m about to run it
Like Chris Brown on a treadmill
With Michael Johnson and
Eddie George
I’ll be in a Porsche

Your car is a Henry Ford
Not a HEMI either
When I’m tourin’
You just a tourist

Life of a Don
Lights keep fucking up my eyes from my arm
This Presidential
Looking like a goddamn collage
Of lights
That attract broads like flies
Better get your girl
I might shock your wife
Buzz
