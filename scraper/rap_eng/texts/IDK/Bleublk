We full of lean shout out to one and [?]
From the jungle peep the blood on Benzo
Them crackers tried to knock me off that payroll
I know they snipping sniffing out my a-hole
Living under microscopic tables
I don't live to love you underraters
Lightning strike and hit on like I'm Raiden
I don't I don't I don't get it
Living [?] the realest nigga privilege

[Verse 3: IDK]
Five star dinners in my Acne denim
Then I take a trip to Dior and see my assy winner
She won't let me give her ebor
Break her back and then she ride me
Opposite of Igor I show no remorse
