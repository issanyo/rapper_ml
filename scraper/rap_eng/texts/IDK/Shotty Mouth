[Intro]

[Hook: Jay IDK]
Monster, Monster
I’m a fucking Monster
Claiming that your hot, I’ll kill your fire like a blunt stomped
Think you’re on a roll, slice your tire screaming ungard
Hotter than the sun, you only hotter when the sun gone

[Verse 1: Jay IDK]
Monster monster
I'm a fucking monster
Bussing like a damn 223 with a 30
Up on your B.I.T. to the C.H. - fuck her
On the mic, I snap like a trucker
Hat on the back fitted cap better duck or get shot by the mini strap that's my tounga’
More shots than a model chick with a tumblr
Dumb down, bitch I couldn't get any dumber
Hotter than the summer
You struggling to even keep it hotter than December
Winter time couldn't intertwine with my rhymes bitch nigga I am thunder
I chief like my whole team three hunna’
Kill more pussy than a cheetah skin hunter
Cupid POP POP POP POP
Every single time I hump her
When I POP POP POP POP on her face then I’m a dump her
Then I POP POP POP POP
On these beats until my tongue hurt
Bitch I’m a monster

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay IDK]
I’ll murder any MC
That's trying to go against me
I start off acting friendly
Then friendly fires inspired, now sirens fire in the streets picking up all the deceased
Basically all the rappers in the DMV

[Outro: Jay IDK]
Nigga I'm tighter than four knots in a box with four locks in Fort Knox while guarded by four cops
