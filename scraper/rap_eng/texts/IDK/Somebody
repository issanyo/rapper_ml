[Hook]
I knew I'd be somebody even when I didn't know who I would be
So know you'll be somebody even when there is a future you can't see
Know you'll be somebody

[Bridge]
Give me stardom
Give me (fame)
Give me money
Give me (change)
Give me cars
Give me (range)
Give me broads
Give me (brain)
Give me this
Give me (that)
Give me
Every thing you (have)
Give me future
Fuck My past
But make me change and it won't last

[Verse 1]
These labels tryna fuck wit ya boy
Cuz they don't know I'm
Poised
No they don't know I'm smart
They don't know my heart
Really in this music shit I make
It's Really real authentic never fake
And I know it's a lot that's on my plate
But That's food for thought I love to eat
I love when you take shots
I love the beef
And if the shit makes sense
I might respond
Cuz I done work way too damn hard from everything that I got
And you will never take it from
Me nigga
Ima PG nigga but I know
DC niggas
All the way from toga
Down to the E street niggas
Over by the boarder with the water
Hole T niggas
When I Had a T Top on my old Z nigga
And I use to go to PGCC nigga
All the hoes use to play me
Especially when I sat at the cafeteria with my pen and a pad tryna rap looking crazy
Now ya hoes play me
Now they wanna save me
But I ain't looking for 100 problems I'm Jay Z
Long as I can't eat and have a roof I'm gravey
So not being rich for a little don't phase me

I knew I'd be somebody even when I didn't know who I would be

[Verse 2]
She use to have a phat as wit some fat titties and a fat pussy now she just fat
Probably cuz she had 3 kids since high school only 21 that's bad
No offense to the young mothers
But offense to the ones that would make fun of me and my jeans
Use to call them shits nut huggers
What up Stacey
I'm petty as a mutherfucker
But I remember those days when I was ashamed to be myself and wanted to change
Now I hate change I only like dollars
I only like the ones that suck and swalla
I only like the ones that fuck no problem
But sorry Stacey I don't want no mama
No drama
Unless it got a grill and it's gangsta
Like manny fresh big tymers
Juvenile
Lil wayne
Mac mane and stunna
UH

Knew I'd be somebody even when I didn't know who I would be
