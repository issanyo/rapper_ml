[Intro]
Ten...Nine...
Ignition sequence starts
Six...Five...Four...Three...Two...One
All engines running

[Hook: Jay IDK]
These niggas lurkin'
In the cut when you broke
But they all in ya face when they see you gettin' dough
These niggas lurkin'
And these bitches lurkin' too
Only thirsty when they see you over flowin' with the juice
These niggas lurkin'
I can't trust nobody, no dog (no dog)
I can't trust nobody, no (these niggas lurkin')
I can't trust nobody, no dog (no dog, keep it runnin')
I can't

[Verse 1: Jay IDK]
Now a days got my eyes open (right)
Lookin' left, lookin' right
All these fools in my face
They smiling acting very nice
I ain't got problems with em (nah)
But that don't mean that I ain't watchin'
Catch me slippin'?
I formation, pass it
That is not an option
Tryna take me out to eat at all these expensive places
When the check come they use company cards as they payment
That ain't yo shit
Nigga, that ain't yo shit
Reason when they think that I am done I order more shit
That lobster for to go shit
Everybody wanna join my circle now
Oh my God
Don't nobody see me as an urkle now
That's a square
That was what they use to call me last year
Bet they only love me long as all my money last, yeah!

[Hook]
These niggas lurkin'
In the cut when you broke
But they all in ya face when they see you gettin' dough
These niggas lurkin'
And these bitches lurkin' too
Only thirsty when they see you over flowin' with the juice
These niggas lurkin'
I can't trust nobody, no dog (no dog)
I can't trust nobody, no (these niggas lurkin')
I can't trust nobody, no dog (no dog)
I can't trust nobody, no

[Verse 2: Deniro Farrar]
I feel like I can’t trust my mama or my motherfuckin' friends
Could have bought an education but instead I bought a Benz
And no college ain't for me
And no bitch this dick ain't free
If you wanna ride this totem
You gon' have to pay a fee
All of my niggas be screaming the same thang
Free my bro in the chain gang
Groupie sluts, chasin' after nuts
They’ll fuck you if you got a lil fame
Fuck once, I ain't call her back
She ain't get a dime or my real name
You paid to fuck, you a real lame
Paper over pussy, that's real game
When you got the juice them hoes gon' fuck you every time
All my niggas really ballin, that shit fuckin wit yo mind
All them diamonds in yo rollie make it hard to tell the time
That's why my goonies in the cut, ready to stick you with that 9
These niggas lurkin'

[Hook]
In the cut when you broke
But they all in ya face when they see you gettin' dough
These niggas lurkin'
And these bitches lurkin' too
Only thirsty when they see you over flowin' with the juice
These niggas lurkin'
I can't trust nobody, no dog (no dog)
I can't trust nobody, no (these niggas lurkin')
I can't trust nobody, no dog (no dog)
I can't

[Verse 3: Jay IDK]
Now a days I got my mouth closed
Listen left, listen right
Let you niggas have the groupies, you can fuck em every night
Bitch I be too focused
Writing when I'm on the road
So when bitches come into my dressing with no clothes
I just be doggin' em
I don't be callin' em
They just be fallin' in
I'm fallin' back
I don't got time to waste
They waste my time in fact
My money too
I'd rather you get in it and hit it
Up in your hotel and kill it
Then wake up in the morning and find your wallet missin'
My nigga listen
Fuck all the kissin'
I ain't got no time for none of that, I'm on a mission
Keep the federals and IRS at a distance
Cause I know every time I'm on a show and on a bill
These niggas lurkin'!

[Hook]
In the cut when you broke
But they all in ya face when they see you gettin' dough
These niggas lurkin'
And these bitches lurkin' too
Only thirsty when they see you over flowin' with the juice
These niggas lurkin'
I can't trust nobody, no dog (no dog)
I can't trust nobody, no (these niggas lurkin')
I can't trust nobody, no dog (no dog)
I can't trust nobody, no (these niggas lurkin')
