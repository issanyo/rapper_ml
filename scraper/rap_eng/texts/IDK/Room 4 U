[Hook: Earlly Mac]
Yeah
I told my money imma make some room for you
Yeah
Stackin' money made me raise the roof
Hell yeah
I put the T-Top on the roof that bitch the truth, finessin' my finances like a Jew
The teller told me tell her how I want it
I told her "it don't matter keep it comin'"

[Verse 1: Earlly Mac]
Yeah, uh
All my niggas rich, all yo niggas might snitch
Called my cousin in the trap, he was working his wrist
Never had a iPhone, but could buy 20 a' dem
Never had a ice chain cause it ain't nothin' to him
That's the way a real nigga do it
(Smooth!)
Yeah
Gotta keep it quiet when we move
Yeah
If you ain't made a hunnid million whatchu doin'?
He could make your life better, bae it's proven
We finally made it to the club and made a movie
We got integrity, charisma, and some Uzi's!
Yeah
Look, all my bitches thick, all yo bitches look sick
Put them choppers in [?]
We could pay with a twist
Never had a problem witchu, you ain't nothin' to me
Never had a problem witchu, bitch, quit frontin' to me

[Hook: Earlly Mac]
I told my money imma make some room for you
Yeah (yeah)
Stackin' money made me raise the roof
Hell yeah
I put the T-Top on the roof that bitch the truth, finessin' my finances like a Jew
The teller told me tell her how I want it
I told her "it don't matter keep it comin'"


[Verse 2: Jay IDK]
Aw, Earlly, do we really have a problem?
What the problem is?
Call up Westside, pew pew
I know they gon' go and get the bitch
Call up DC, pew pew
Get the dog and then they barkin' shit
BONG BONG BONG
That's the sound of when the choppa  hit
Got a new bitch, yeah my new bitch
African
Imma blow her back out then I never call her back again
Mac gon pull the mac out if you actin' like you adamant
We gon click-click blackout if you playing with my sack again
Listen I ain't never shoot a nigga and I ain't gotta do it, I know simple city niggas that ain't jump might just prove it
I know Congress pop niggas when you see em, you cool it
If you still get the fakin', man, yo ass would be foolish!
They gon' jack up yo jewelry, while they dodgin' the jury, I'm just making it clear, like I'm watchin' a Blu-ray
All my shit is a movie
No your shit do not move me
My dick went up like balloon
From the way that she blew me

[Hook: Earlly Mac]
I told my money imma make some room for you

Stackin' money made me raise the roof
Hell yeah
I put the T-Top on the roof that bitch the truth, finessin' my finances like a Jew
