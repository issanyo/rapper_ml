When I picture selling dope
I picture big fat 'ol asses
Big Cartier glasses
Champagne in my glasses
When I'm wearing FENDI clothes
I picture big fat 'ol asses
Big Cartier glasses
Champagne in my glasses
Hit the club and shut it down
I picture money money
Big Big Big money (yes) (x3)
Car got hit with 50 rounds
I picture money money
Big Big Big money (yes) (x3)

[Verse 1: Jay IDK]
My vices gon make me go blind
I go blind all my vices go dumb
I just a bought a new Lamborghini
But 'a' mean I only have one (skrrr)
I don't like to work for my shit
What is work when you only have fun?
A hundreds of thousands of bitches that suuuck
All on my stick (ay)
Give me head while I shift lanes
Is it Cash, or is it Fame?
Fuck her one I got six chains, two chains
Told me that damn right I got it (all right)
You ain't got shit lets be honest (okay)
How she your wife with no ring
When I hold up my ring on my pinky
Like we made a promise and she gonna vow to fuck
You spend all your money on wishing wells
You running outta luck (what's that)
I hit it, then pass it, then screw it
Your sisters the gamers assist (all right)
I say all this shit just to say that my ignorance bliss
I ball, I swish, you ball, you miss

[Verse 2: Jay IDK]
I swipe my credit card to the left
Write my signature
On the back of that check (that check)
Cash the check and ball
Like I play for the Nets (the nets, swish)
Bitches stare in awe
Cause they know I'm up next
They pokin they holes to invest
I don't ever stress
I'm just playin chess and I'm pretty good
That's why they never check
Me I'm such a Don; Christian Louboutin
Getting kinda old, gimme Saint Laurent
With the Visvim, Rick Owens boots
With the Acne jeans or the Yeezy Boosts
Gimme double shots that's a deuce deuce
She gon' blow the pipe
Like she play the flute or the claronet
Cause it's big and black
I ain't Will Smith, I don't gotta act
Counting up the cash, getting all the guap
Haters getting red, but I never stop
Y'all were never hot
Who the fuck is y'all? It's like you never block
We cannot recall, no not at all (noooo)
I swish, I'm ballin, I ball
