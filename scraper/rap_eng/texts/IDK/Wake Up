Dis shit dat shit I dream about
Dis shit dat shit I dream about
Dis shit dat shit I dream about
Dis shit dat shit I dream about
Dis shit dat shit I dream about
Dis shit dat shit I dream about

I done fucked so many groupies I done lost count
Throwing ones at the club Going all out!
Labels Tryna cut the deal
Like I copped out
That's that shit that's gone get me up out my moms house
Even if I don't, I built my own company
Cut dat out, If IRS try to come for me if I had a bad day
Bad day, bad bitch she gone comfort me
She gone give me what I need
She gon suck on me
Catch me Rollin to the bank
Wit my day 1s
Walkin out with a bag, that shit weigh a ton
Ima spend it on that rickie
And that wang shit
Got a shooter in my circle
He gone bang quick
I ain't never been a fan of that Lameness
If You a lame
You are manual, makeshift
This my mother fuckin life when my eyes shut
That's the reason why I'm Mad when I wake up
Lord
Lord
