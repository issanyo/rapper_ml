[Intro]
I mean like nowadays you can be whatever the fuck you want to be on the internet, you know?
I got a lot of living to do before I die
And I ain’t got time to fake
Fake ass niggas
You say you a gangsta but you never pop nothing
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop fronting

[Verse 1]
I got a question (what?)
Why you rap niggas be lying
You post your guns knowing damn well you don’t be firing (haha)
Tryina snitch soon as you see them red and blue sirens
You got beef you grab the heat and IG Live it (yeah)
Real ones move in silence
Real ones see your page and they be huffing and sighing
They be like 'Ok, this nigga sweet let's try him'
Then they snatch your chain
Then it’ll be on Akademiks before the end of the day
(DJ Akakdemiks voice)
You pull up skrt, click
Shots fired, Glock-nine, Fox 5, helicopter
Killer they cannot find
That’s a fucking lie
If you really did it why the fuck you put it in your rhymes (yea)
You just dropped the fucking dime - stupid
You a doofus
They ruthless
They leave you toothless
The gon put you to sleep very lucid (right)
They gon shoot at you I don’t mean cupid
Go to jail and they poke you no toothpick, ooh
Make your family throw up the deuces
You are not a thug you be boosting
You don’t want static you niggas acoustic, AHHH!

[Hook]
You say you a gangsta but you never pop nothing
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop fronting
You go in the dealership but you don’t ever cop nothing
You been hustling a long time and but you ain’t got nothing
You say you a gangsta but you never pop nothing
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop fronting
You go in the dealership but you don’t ever cop nothing
You been hustling a long time and but you ain’t got nothing

[Verse 2]
Damn homie
You say the ice cost bands homie
Why the fuck the diamond testers say that shit is baloney
(haha) It’s fugazi its phony
A lot of rappers be lying so look you not by your lonely
Niggas be saying it’s from Avianne
Yellow diamonds yea they look like Kehlani
Come to find out all their diamonds is Chinese
Hmm no wonder the shit ain’t as shiny
Hmm I wonder how niggas be fooling you
Put it together that shit is like 2 and 2
This is 250 they only made 50
I’m too 100 so there ain’t no fake in me
Taking pics by a fucking car
You know that ain’t yours
You might get all your shit robbed
Faking for them broads
Put the strap to your damn jaw
You say what’s the cost
Don’t get shot for a chain that you got from the mall, awww
Rapping from my head I don’t need no pen this is so easy
All I gotta do is look at my IG
All I see is niggas acting and smiling
Niggas be wellin' swellin' lyin'
And they be snitching telling quietly
You ain’t no gangsta
You is a wanksta
You help me make this
So I’m a thank ya

[Hook]
