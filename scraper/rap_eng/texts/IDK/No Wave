[Chorus: IDK]
I'm goin' uptown with a smile and my tongue brown
Rollie in my name, Plain Jane, what's a bust down?
Nigga, I ain't on what you on, you a fuckin' fraud
You know that ain't law, not at all
See I could fuck the wave up, bitch, that ain't the wave now
I could fuck the wave up, bitch, that ain't the wave now
I could fuck the wave up, bitch, that ain't the wave now
I could fuck the wave up, bitch, that ain't the wave now

[Verse 1: IDK]
Ballin', it's a lay-up, shots gon' make you lay down
Niggas keep on hatin', they know they ain't safe now
I might have to take shit, run up in your safehouse
Did a show in Paris, now I'm off to Cape Town (run it, run it)
I came from spammin' on DMs
But now shit done changed, I go HAM on your BM
They used to make fun of him, now they wan' be him
See I just be sonnin' 'em A.M. to P.M
You didn't believe him and now you done changed, I'm no angel, the demon
Yeah, you like to smile in his face when you see him
That's why I don't look in your face for a reason
Bitch, this is a Black Mirror season, I'm

[Chorus: IDK]
I'm goin' uptown with a smile and my tongue brown
Rollie in my name, Plain Jane, what's a bust down?
Nigga, I ain't on what you on, you a fuckin' fraud
You know that ain't law, not at all
See I could fuck the wave up, bitch, that ain't the wave now
I could fuck the wave up, bitch, that ain't the wave now
I could fuck the wave up, bitch, that ain't the wave now
I could fuck the wave up, bitch, that ain't the wave now

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Thurgood Marshall artist
If you try to hit a foul like Artemis, uh
For the new wave, I started it
Like a du-rag when you open up the starter kit, uh
Same shit but a new fly, Jay I
D got a motherfuckin' K on the side
Chopped off now a nigga lay on the side
Yellow tape, everybody pray on the side
Noah's Ark, I made my mark
So, nigga, don't start with me, don't fuck with me
From the dust, I'm Spartacus
So anybody touchin' me is first degree
Whirlwind, mixed with a whirlpool
Denzel 'bout to make a fuckin' typhoon
What can I say? I'm a boss tycoon
Coolest monkey in the jungle, not a baboon, ah

[Chorus: IDK]
I'm goin' uptown with a smile and my tongue brown
Rollie in my name, Plain Jane, what's a bust down?
Nigga, I ain't on what you on, you a fuckin' fraud
You know that ain't law, not at all
See I could fuck the wave up, bitch, that ain't the wave now
I could fuck the wave up, bitch, that ain't the wave now
I could fuck the wave up, bitch, that ain't the wave now
I could fuck the wave up, bitch, that ain't the wave now
