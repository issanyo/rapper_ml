[Chorus: Geek]
I see an angel
Walking beside me
Asking me if I would like to come home
Would like to come home (4X)

[Verse 1: Jay IDK]
Have you ever heard the sound of 100 Choppas
Bussin at you from every angle
Make your body freeze like a statue
Hack you
And then Kurt Angle
Slam you like pissed off police
That’s what happens when you put IDK on the beat
This is a brief warning, bitch don’t push me
If there’s a fight I start
You a 12th round rookie
I’m the kid who faked bomb threats to play hookie
You the type that’s born hermaphrodite and keep the pussy
Pussy
I’ll fuck up your whole life
Soon as you find out that I’m fucking your whore wife
I walk inside the room, tell your daughter to hold tight
And if the hole tight
I still give her the whole pipe
That was my other side talking, He sort of lost it
Because the side that he’s trying to follow’s inclosed by caution tape
He’s dead, He’s dead
I have no head
My frontal lobe is hanging from a noose of thread

[Chorus: Geek]
I see an angel
Walking beside me
Asking me if I would like to come home
Would like to come home (4X)

[Verse 2: Jay IDK]
I hate positive beings that try to make thing seem
Like everything’s okay
When the reality stings
Like 40 rounds from a K
Shut up your face before I cut off your head and use your brains as a display
I like eating ice cream
The thought of
???
Excites me
The thought of killing innocent tourists and leaving their bodies in a forest to rigamortis right before I sightsee
Makes me content
Its the way that I vent
One time I torched my landlord for asking for rent
I had a bad day
He came at the wrong time
Approximately a minute after Satan called my landline

[Skit]

[Chorus: Geek]
I see an angel
Walking beside me
Asking me if I would like to come home
Would like to come home (4X)

[Verse 3: Ryan Lee]
Dear insanity
Who’s the man in the vanity
Ego big as a manatee
Manically eating anchovies
In the midst of calamity niggas panicking
He’s as cool as the pillow he suffocated your family with
He’s frantically trying to better humanity
He loves fuckin so fuck it he’s profanity
And no scantily clad women
He had been in
Still suppressing memories from when they dads went in
And he’s gross like flatulence
If niggas think they gassed up let the match commence
Until he opens up the hatch
Get the rachet
And like a pool shark, he’s walking out without a scratch - he wins
He’s been insane
His personalities clash
He feels like he martin pain
He looking in the mirror
I think he’s looking at me
Apparently he makes his appearances in a beat
Sincerely
Ryan Lee

[Verse 4: Jarren Benton]
Reverse the fucking Coupe
Then I shoot at you through the sunroof
I cut back on my drinking
One line of coke and just one brew
Show you the art of war with a oyster knife
This ain’t Sun Tzu
Tell ya momma to come through
We can kick it like kung-fu
Come on bitch you tripping
Really I promise I’m not that deranged
These rappers are lames
Okay I’m reloaded
This Gensu
Will make you drop out of your brain
Fuck ya Maybach
Bitch i got a propeller plane
On top of my Honda Accord
I hover through earth
I have one hell of a day
The kick on this AK is crazy
BBBBRRRRRAAAAAAATTT
Damn
One hell of a spray
I’m Tony Montana and Hellen Leshae
Put 2 in ya face, put you in a grave
A bad mix of narcotics has got my bitch pukin’
I like white sluts that suck dick for fig newton
My music influencing heroin usage
And if you dumb enough to do it fucker you’re stupid
Its like the mind of leatherface meets George Lucas
Kidnap Ke$ha then I beat it till the whore stupid

[Verse 5: Jay IDK]
I’m the type to tell a bitch to suck my dick inside a church
And if she ask me why, I lie, and say its in a bible verse
I’m the worst
I think I'll probably carjack a hearse
Run up to a senior citizen and jack her fucking purse
Pursuing a rap career wasn’t in my plans, ho
Plans, ho
I would have been just fine
Running round trying to slash thoughts asshole
I think I need a shot just to kill the pain
Fuck a shot I need an automatic block to my brain

Bitch I’m a drinker and driver
Conniving thief and a liar
Aspiring pervert conspiring a way to spy on Mariah
When she comes out her attire
I’ll beat my dick till its tired
And when she turn around I’ll jump up off the tree that I’m hiding in
After that never rap again
Thats the reason I came in this rap career
To get a physical look of Mariah's rear
Messiah is here
You tired of fear?
Drink a bottle of tylenol till you start to feel
Ahhhh
Tired, you hear?
Bye
