Dear Reagan, AKA the plug
Thank you for everything you've given us
Supporting us with all these drugs
Providing us with all this un-taxed money
This is amazing, the other day
My big brother, Jon Jon, was able to pay our overdue rent right before they evicted us
That woulda' been bad, but we good now
I mean, yeah it's a little hard walking past my friend's
Drug addicted parents on my way to school
But shoot, it's better them than me, right
The only thing I really have to worry about is
Jon Jon getting killed locked up again
'Cause then I'ma have to sell drugs
