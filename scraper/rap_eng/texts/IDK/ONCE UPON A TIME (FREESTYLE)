[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Uh, when it comes to wordplay, I'm bringin’ it
Everything I do is spine-tinglin'
Guaranteed to keep your mind lingerin'
When it comes down to me and the world, I’m fingerin'
Me against the world, leave the ocean full of pearls
Oyster, guarantee to get the pussy moister
If the earth don't wanna be saved, I disappoint her
As I constantly try to evolve just like a Togepi
Keep my pockets thick as The Parkers, Professor Oglevee
No one's sick as me, have the common cold, catch a cold from me
Isn't it ironic the younger me is the older me?
Fans demand that I rap about shit I did at seventeen
Might as well've cut my hair off and take some LSD

[Verse 2: IDK]
Disrespect Zel' and I might have to raise hell
The only way you live is if you saved by the bell
'Cause I’m teaching niggas lessons while they find a way to fail
That’s the reason why I think you niggas trippin' like you fell
Well, I flip a coin and make a wish
I wish these pussy niggas found a way to hop up off my dick
I flick my wrist and make her disappear, now that’s a fuckin' trick
I trick a nigga off the liquor to give me the money 'fore I fuckin' flip him
The diamonds on my neck wet, flippa
She wet but her last man wasn’t a good swimmer
Sim Simma, who got the keys to my Bimmer?
And then I check my pockets like, "Oh, it's me, nigga" (Skrrt)

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
Remember to remember
Matter fact, remember the fifth of November
Too many scars upon my face, no Simba
Rappers thinkin' they the most dark but I'm dimmer
Mos Def and grimmer
Dare to witness the superficial, mean and vicious
I'm mad as a infant without a parent havin' interest
Suspicious intent, ridin' around in five percent tint
Will push your cap back and send your soul to new dimensions
The ammunition only ignited my ignition
My ambition is only make right decisions on my mission
My division is separate from my business and my bitches
Every sentence and line is a reflection of time

[Verse 4: IDK]
My times table never was good at the time I was nine
At seventeen, I was forced in a 9-to-the-5
So 9 times out of 10, I'm despising the eyes of the greedy ones
All around me like some fucking flies, get away
Bye-bye, NSYNC
Lie, lie, instinct
Y'all niggas some fossils tellin' me how to live my life
Just suck my dick and bump my shit
And stream my shit so I can go and count my grip
Reverse the slavery every time I pull out my whip
Then pull up on a racist race like I am the shit
I limp towards the cake 'cause I am the pimp
Ain't nobody fuckin' my contracts up like Prince, uh
