[Verse 1: Tate Kobang]
Granny asked me if I’m ready, to be honest with her
I’m really not, but I’ve been practicing responding quicker
Even though the lord prepared me, I can’t contradict her
But at the moment I’m more worried ‘bout the hoes and liquor
Still the coldest killer, all my rollers known gorillas
Clouds Only, give a fuck if they ain’t rolling with us
Had to get that blood test, that really hurt my soul
Like I ain’t know in ninth grade that you can’t love them hoes
Slow, who told y’all niggas you was ever needed?
Cause in my eyes y’all never had it, I’m just being honest
That ain’t rhyme, but it’s been more ‘bout the fucking climate
The ball dropped, I turned cold, that shit was perfect timing
Damn, my penmanship been getting heavy lately
I’m to the point where chasing money can’t leave heaven waiting
She bad as hell in all red, I’m in the bed with satan
I use my ties and offering to make these reservations
My cousin say he love that trap money, that pack money
I need that back to back money, fuck this rap money
That change up on they ass, I don’t know how to act money
Like where you been at big head, so you gon’ act funny?

[Hook: Tate Kobang]
I could do this every day
New money, same Glock, smoking Mary J
Same clique, new bitch, fucking every day
Dirty money, clean money, get it every way
God, I could do this every day
New money, same Glock, smoking Mary J
Same clique, new bitch, fucking every day
Dirty money, clean money, get it every way

[Verse 2: Tate Kobang]
I had to look my children in they eyes on Christmas
And let ‘em know that daddy hurtin’ but a nigga working
Once we leave it ain’t no coming back, and that’s for certain
If I die today I pray it’s for a better purpose
Living life without a dime make you a better person
They comparing me to me, just a better version
How you asking for percentages but never working?
I just want to be the one who help whoever hurting
I’m not stingy with my heart, just no one’s ever worth it
Seem to fall for stripper bitches, they forever twerking
Like, shake something bitch
Better hope I’m drunk enough for you to make something bitch
Yeah, there I go
Being selfish, it’s the pimp that’s in me
You can really say you made it when you sick of Henny
I remember it was days we couldn’t get us any
And now we buzzing, I’m in New York, that’s word to envy
Banger, say a prayer for the weak
Lord protect them from my friends
Got bullets for my enemies
Sometime times I even do spray

[Hook: Tate Kobang]
I could do this every day
New money, same Glock, smoking Mary J
Same clique, new bitch, fucking every day
Dirty money, clean money, get it every way
Yeah, but I could do this every day
New money, same Glock, smoking Mary J
Same clique, new bitch, fucking every day
Dirty money, clean money, get it every way

[Verse 3: Jay IDK]
I just did a show, I just met Wale
He told me that he was a fan, he said your shit is great
I’m like I must be fucking dreaming, please don’t let me wake
Please I’d rather be fighting with demons while you view my wake
But instead I’m on Tate’s tape
Dodging white bitches, tryna get cake
Don’t claim rape
Tryna get me life and burn a nigga like a KK
K, nigga fuck that
This rap’s gonna dispatch me from all this bitch ass
Negative shit, remember when my bank account was on negative? Shit
Yeah I’m buzzing a little bit but ain’t settling shit
Won’t settle ‘til I’m steering the ship
And if that shit sink, find me a boat and paddle that bitch
And if that bitch leak, swim for the shore and climb up the cliff
Cause bitch my 16, the only reason that I exist
My floatation device, my patience when I’m pacing at night
Tryna question myself, thinking if what I’m doing is right
Alright?
Cause I could do this every day
I had a choice to write a rhyme or let the semi spray
Dirty money, clean money, get it any way
Cause I could do this every day
