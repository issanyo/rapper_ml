I told my job I was quitting
I told my school I was finished
My mama told me I’m sinning
I told her
"Mama I'm winning"
I told myself I would kill it
Ain't been to sleep in a minute
They used to think I was kidding
But now they see I’m the Realest
When they see
Champagne in the air
Like a matched up flair
Thank God we don't got Michael Jacksons’ here
Thank God for my TRiBE
We gon clap this year
Pop pop
Leave rap on its back this year!
I'm IDK
I was born in May
Gemini
Genocide
Every living thing
Renaissance
When I'm on the mic
Shanking up the game
Whip lash if you
In my way
Make another lane
What's goals?

Living in a big condo with my wrist froze - my nigga that's goals
Four Wives
Any need for a side hoe?
Na HOE!
Nigga that's goals
And the name of the car parked in the park lot
Hooooollluuuuuuppppp
That's Goals
Hunnit grand for a whip
That's a lot
For a nigga like me that's Low

I'm Spamming on Twitter
Tryna get bigger
While you niggas snap chatting is NOT getting the picture
Fuck Em'
I ain't bout to diss Em'
Dismiss EM
They squares - rectangular prizims
Run Circles 'round where they living
With bars
Put em in prison

Y’all niggas dont work like me
Y’all don't got your own label and its LLC'ed
You don't work your own street team or MGMT
Sit your ass down
You ain't gotta figure out
How to cut a budget when the funds ain't right
No sleep when we gotta meet Wednesday night
And I still gotta write shit like this
For relevance
I don't really care what you think
