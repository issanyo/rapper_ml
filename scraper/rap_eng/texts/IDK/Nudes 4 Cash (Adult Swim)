[Verse 1: Jay IDK]
You're real freaked out
And you be talking so dirty with your freak mouth
I whip it out, she open up
Girl what it be 'bout
You keep on slurp slurp like you do
I'ma put my knees down
After that I'ma eat out
Better yet where the groceries at Say what
Better know that I'm gross in fact
Better know I'm a hoe
When I hold your hands behind your head as I blow your back
Say who
Better yet where your homies at
Better yet where my homies at
We can do what we do in the back of the room when we get to the..

[Pre-Hook]
Send me a naked Picture
I wanna see that pretty ass and you titties pretty too
Snap that pussy with the flash
Send me a naked picture, and I'll be running to your house
I'll be already hard, nothing left to do but pound

[Hook]
Send me a naked picture
Picture Picture, Picture Picture
Snap chat fuck that, make it last
Send me a naked picture

[Verse 2: Jay IDK]
I eat that booty nothing less than an hour
What it taste like?
Nothing if its fresh out the shower
You can call me the arouser
Make it wetter than it rain on Eddy Bauer
Got me harder than Mario beating Bowser
Every time your feeling on my stick through the trousers
Like a pimp, smacking on your ass with the powder
If she bout to cum when I fuck to the uhhh
Every time I wear them grey sweat pants
She be like damn, I be like yeah okay
You're looking at my crotch in a trance
It's getting intense, I think its time to dance touch√©
Put that dick inside that box
I make it cream you call me poppy
Porno star like pinky rocky
I make you cum and now you want me more and more
But I'm the opposite I want you less and less
I want you more for sex
Cuz more or less than relation ship, less stress
But I beat that pussy like its mine, I tell her only one more time
But that turns to ten more times
And bang bang bang like a tech or a nine

[Verse 3: Pell]
I can be your inspiration
Motivation
Confidence when they be hating
Conversation
Confidant, when you in need of a vacation
From  the bull shit life be brining
I can be that human being, that you lean on when the world is leaning on you
And you feeling, you can't take it
I can be the one to teach you how to take it
You don't need no magnifying glass to see me when I'm naked
I can be your hidden treasure
You can be my perfect weather
However , my baby we can't be forever
Forever ever
Said we can't be forever ever
We can't be forever ever
Forever ever
We can't be forever ever
