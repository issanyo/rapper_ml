[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Denzel 'bout to bring the pain, uh-huh
Flowin' like I've never seen a drain, uh-huh
Undertaker and my nigga Kane, uh-huh
Hardest tag-team in the game, uh-huh
ULT that be the campaign, uh-huh
Doin' stupid shit to get a name, uh-huh
Me to you, don't be the one to blame, uh-huh
Stupid niggas get a lot of fame, uh-huh
I don't fuck with you cause you a lame, uh-huh
Smack a pussy nigga out the frame, uh-huh
Spin kick leaf hurricane, uh-huh
Hit a nigga with the novacane, uh-huh
Knock-out, uh, rock-out, uh
Denny got some shit to air the block out, uh
Lock-out, uh, knock-out, uh
He done with the work, it's time to clock-out, uh

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Bitch better fly out the buy out (what?)
Bitch better run out or die now (okay)
Bitch better fly out the buy out (what?)
I run the game, ain't no time out (yeah)
Bitch better fly out the buy out (uh)
Bitch better run out or die now (okay)
Bitch better fly out the buy out (yeah)
I run the game, ain't no time out (yeah)

[Verse 2: IDK]
PG nigga, no point guard
Where them niggas still shoot to make a point, uh
Dodgin' all the pigs, no oink oink, uh
Do a five-year bid for the points, uh
Come back, feel the pain in his voice, uh (aight)
Tatted up, put the shank on a hoist, uh (right)
Shank shank for the bank when the boy start (yeah)
Now we back doin' 10 in the joint, uh
That's the story though
Only 15 with the .30 and the .40, more kills for the bills
No chill how the story go, he don't know his father
But he'll never go to Maury though, he about to overload
Check your pockets, 40 low, click and clock with .44
If he hear an undertone, cock it back and let it go
Front page, centerfold, mugshot, there he go
I know how the story go, you can read it in the post

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Bitch better fly out the buy out (what?)
Bitch better run out or die now (okay)
Bitch better fly out the buy out (what?)
I run the game, ain't no time out (yeah)
Bitch better fly out the buy out (uh)
Bitch better run out or die now (okay)
Bitch better fly out the buy out (yeah)
I run the game, ain't no time out (yeah)
