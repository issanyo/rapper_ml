[Intro]
Your, friends, gon', snitch, on you
Your friends gon' snitch on you
Your, friends, gon', snitch, on you

[Chorus]
They smiling in your face but then finesse you for the work
They claim to be your friend but put your name inside the dirt
I don't trust nobody, I don't trust nobody
Sorry, sorry, sorry, bitch, your sorry ain't gon' work
Sorry, sorry, sorry, bitch, your sorry ain't gon' work
I don’t trust no-no-no-nobody, I don’t trust no-o-o-o-o-body

[Verse]
All I want to do is get my mom a couple bands
All I want to do is cop them new designer brands
All I want to do is see the money in my hand
So why the fuck you snitching cause I sold a couple grams
Bitch I'm on a mission for the chains and a coupe
Biggie said it best, "Fuck a check, gimme the loot"
No new friends in my circle, in my crew
Text me but your number ain't saved, "Who are you?"
Fuck the function, most them niggas on that fuck shit
Say they ride or die they see the opps they on that duck shit
Lately I been happy being single fuck the love shit
All the shit I bought you should've been a tax deduction
I don't want your dap, fuck your dap, all I want is cash
If you cross me once, cut you off, you don't get no pass
I don't gotta floss, gotta flex, I don't gotta act
On the other hand, you's a act that don't know how to act

[Bridge]
If I see you in the streets, ain't no words for you
If I see you around the way, ain't no words for you
If I see you in the streets, ain't no words for you
If I see you around the way

[Chorus]
They smiling in your face but then finesse you for the work
They claim to be your friend but put your name inside the dirt
I don't trust nobody, I don't trust nobody
Sorry, sorry, sorry, bitch, your sorry ain't gon' work
Sorry, sorry, sorry, bitch, your sorry ain't gon' work
I don’t trust no-no-no-nobody, I don’t trust no-o-o-o-o-body
