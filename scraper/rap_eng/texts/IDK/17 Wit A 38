[Intro: IDK]
This that dirty stinkin' nasty ratchet rowdy shit

[Chorus: IDK]
Young nigga wit a .38 (young nigga wit a .38)
Young nigga wit a .38 (young nigga wit a .38)
17 with the .38 (17 with the .38)
I was 17 with the .38 (17 with the .38)

[Verse 1: IDK]
I was only 17 when I had that 38 (8-8-8-8)
I was trying to prove something
Show 'em that I didn't play (play play play play)
If a nigga do me wrong
Make him see the pearly gates (bang bang bang bang)
Truth is, I ain't shoot shit, it was just for fake
Truth is, I ain't do shit but rob white folk
Lure they ass to a place I know
Take they money, take they phone, there it goes
Sell the shit at my school for the low
Stack the money, stack the money, buy shoes
Stack the money, stack the money, buy clothes
Taking penitentiary risks, all for
Ed Hardy belts with the rhinestone
Hit the Georgetown (swerve) I got whores now (swerve)
Polo wasn't Ralph (word) it's a horse now
Slow down, slow down's what my mama said
She couldn't get that shit through my head
You can't expect me to give respect
When I would fuck bitches on mama bed

[Chorus: IDK & Chief Keef]
Young nigga wit a .38 (young nigga wit a .38)
Young nigga wit a .38 (young nigga wit a .38)
17 with the .38 (17 with the .38)
I was 17 with the .38 (17 with the--)
Sosa baby

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I was 17 with a .357
Foot heavy, can't speed the limit
All black, Ghost Rider, I'm creeping in it
Gotta be a real nigga, don't be pretending
If I'm in it then you know it got reefer in it
You don't see it nigga? I can re-present it
Took a bitch life, and I'll re-invent it
Can't leave without peeing in it
Pants saggin' but this belt ain't cheap, ayy ayy
Got a swiper on me, nothin' ain't free, ayy ayy
Would've bought the shit but it ain't me, ayy ayy
Yeah, you down nigga but it ain't steep, ayy ayy
In this Humvee, me and the pack
Throwing shells even if you can't catch it
We gon test him even if he can't pass it
I know you sending what we can't pass, ayy ayy
Little woadie run the bus, bust the clit, make it puss
What's in me? It ain't trust, it ain't gang, it ain't fuss
Surf the wave now it's brush, you ain't got a nice function
Know I'll run it up like she know Fredo in the cut
Enough gears for some years, leave a bitch with a tear
Leave a bitch for a year, leave a bitch in a mirror
Send it, you got it, I don't see it as an error
May storm in the club, interfering with the weather

[Chorus: IDK]
Young nigga wit a .38 (young nigga wit a .38)
Young nigga wit a .38 (young nigga wit a .38)
17 with the .38 (17 with the .38)
I was 17 with the .38 (17 with the .38)
