Part I

[Intro]
BLWYRMND

[Verse 1: IDK]
This that drive-by, this that Shawty Lo in Impala
Hello out the whip with the clip, make you bye-bye
Roll the windows up, hotbox, smokin' la la
Roll the windows down, see the opps, it's a problem
Shit, really I'm a good boy
But that Trapaholics tag turned me to a hood boy
Blunt guts on the floor, I'm a Backwood boy
Lookin' at me wrong, make you wish you never looked, boy
Screamin' out the window like, "Fuck you, pay me"
Snake you for the cash like my nickname Baby (brrr)
Used to have a job, but that job barely paid me
Charley's Grilled Subs tried to minimum wage me, l-l-lately
Hangin' with my niggas makes me wanna start trouble
If they fight, I'ma fight, make this shit a royal rumble
I'm a gang gang nigga 'til the jump outs come
If the jump outs come, guarantee I'm gon' run

[Chorus: Yung Gleesh & IDK]
Here's a little story 'bout them boys that's hittin' licks, ayy
Pizza spot, pizza shop, gimme that shit, ayy
Gimme that shit, ayy, gimme that shit, ayy
Pizza spot, pizza shop, gimme that shit, ayy
Here's a little story 'bout them boys that's hittin' licks, ayy
Run nigga nigga, run nigga nigga, run
Pizza spot, pizza shop, gimme that shit, ayy
Run nigga nigga, run nigga nigga, run
Gimme that shit, ayy, gimme that shit, ayy
Run nigga nigga, run nigga nigga, run
Pizza spot, pizza shop, gimme that shit, ayy
Run nigga nigga, run nigga nigga, run

[Verse 2: IDK]
I used to wanna hang with Dae Dae and them (Dae Dae and them)
I used to wanna hang with Nelson and them (Nelson and them)
I used to wanna hang with Diemon and them (Diemon and them)
'Til they gave all three 40 years in the pen
But that's the way you get respect when you tryna be 'bout it
Shit I was goin' down that road but my phone kept reroutin'
They tryna go the right way, but the left said "ayy"
You gon' ride, ride, ride, ride, ride for the gang
So now we speedin' to the pizza place, closin' up, it's gettin' late
Someone gotta rob the shit, everybody look at Jay
Gang gang nigga when the jump outs come
If the jump outs come, guarantee I'm gon' run that shit

[Interlude]
Drop this, it's like a fuckin' gunshot blaow!


Part II

[Intro: IDK]
Load the, clip, rob, repeat
Load the, clip, rob, repeat
Load the, clip, rob, repeat
Load the, clip, rob, repeat

[Verse 1: IDK & his thoughts]
Now everybody get up on the fuckin' ground
And if you make a sound, I might have to drown it with these rounds
Knowin' I'm no killer but fuck it, I'm tryna be that nigga
So my actin' skills kick in, I'm Michael Jackson off of "Thriller", hehehe
Where the safe at? Don't make me ask again, where the safe at?
Next question is: where the tape at?
That's when I seen a red light blinkin' in peripheral
I took the cam's position and reversed it like reciprocal, hah
I put a gun to her neck, she put her hand on the safe
I hear a car creepin' up, and then I tell her to wait
Hold up, don't make a sound, just let his ass drive around
And you will not feel a round, shhh

[Bridge: IDK]
Car creepin' up, creepin' up, creep, creepin' up, uh
Car creepin' up, creepin' up, creep, creepin' up
Police car creepin' up, creepin' up, creep, creepin' up, uh
Car creepin' up, creepin' up, creep, creep

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
Me the villain
Dudes known to do more hustlin' than stealin'
Papi snatch your soul out if you're in your feelings
Never do no types of discussions around dealings (get focused y'all)
Telephone bring repercussions to your well-being
And Instagram put clowns in a jam
Doin' 10 straight in a cell, hot plate eatin' spam
Wanna be the man but don't see the plan

[Verse 3: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Finally someone let me out of my cage
Little did they know, I'ma hit the front page in three days (damn!)
These days peeps do anything to make a buck (I know)
Jackin' jackers like they tryna win the sweepstakes
Each day I be fightin' for my sanity (yeah)
My ho stay mad at me (what?) she just a liability (fuck it)
She called the pizza shop, said she needed a delivery
They arrived but she broke - are you kiddin' me?!
I got back from answerin' job calls
I seen a fool hop out the window, just boxers on
I recognized him from the pizza shop
I'm already deducin' that my hoe had to have somethin' to do with this
