Eating animal crackers
Working my hippocampus
Screaming fuck the campus
I'd rather be on my MC Hammer
Hammer any rapper that rap at me
Happily
Bitch you gone need more that your traction control to handle me
Sleepin on me
Time flip over your fucking canopy
Walk up to you, zip it down
Whip it out
Then I start to pee

You pussy rappers keep throwing disses
With rhymes so weak I almost though you was blowing kisses
Your misses
Miss this
Dickin'
And when I call the team for assistance
Pippen
The reason why she come up in your house
Limpin'
And hell yea we come up on the mouth that you kissing
A tooth brush won't do much for this thick nut
She told me how your ass had problems getting your dick up
And you finish quicker
Than a hick up
Get at me dude
I would happily clap your crew
They just PWA's
Pussies With Attitude
And don't ever go to jail
Cause them niggas with snatch your food
Might Feel sorry for your punk ass
Leave you a snack or two
Start to laugh
Take the snack back
And probably snack on you
Stomp you out
Until you mouth
And your eyes turn black and blue
Hold up
You got the juice and I'm tryna get it, so get the picture
You on the edge
Time to knock you off of the building bishop
I'm thirsty
And I don't mean for the bitches
Or riches
I fiend
For you beings respecting my lyrics
So please
Move out of my fucking way
I'm not tryna get out the K
And aiming at your fucking blog
Release the safety cock and spray....

But if I have to I'll do it
I'm tired of seeing you
Posting spitters
Lacking the fluid
Word to Game
My nigga this more than music
Like a pony with one leg
You whores is useless
So I don't pay attention to 'em
I just book 'em and do 'em
Tell em promote
You know
I just basically use em

Kinda like they trying do me
Can't ever wife em if they use to be a groupie

Now that's a gem

Next time
I'm Eating animal crackers
Working my hippocampus
Screaming fuck the campus
Beware of the Maryland MC hammer
