Part 1

[Intro]
Three things I don't understand is
Death, women and, mm-probably death again
If it wasn't for my pen I would prolly would be dead
But instead its Mama, Prince, and MJ, damn
They said

[Chorus]
Baby, I gotta drift away
I drift away so far away
Baby, I gotta drift away
I drift away so far away
Ooh ooh, ohh ohh
Ooh ooh, ohh ohh ohh
Ooh ooh, ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh ohh

[Verse 1]
I see you in the stars, I see you in my heart
I see you in my soul, I hear you from afar
You saying, "Take care, my love, farewell until next time"
But this is the shit that make a grown man cry
A blink away from tears, her angel in my ear
To tell me that I’m out and it’ll soak up all the fear
And now I’m never scared so never's never too long
'Til I heard her voice saying goodbye and now she gone
Told me

[Chorus]
Baby, I gotta drift away
I drift away so far away
Baby, I gotta drift away
I drift away so far away
Ooh ooh, ohh ohh
Ooh ooh, ohh ohh ohh
Ooh ooh, ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh ohh

[Verse 2]
I lived my whole life knowing you was gonna go before your time
I knew you was sick but you lied tryna tell me you was fine
And in my mind, I was tryna make it the truth
Knowing that your mortality would chuck up the deuce
That’s why I never really wanted to get close to you
That’s why I never did what a son was supposed to do
That’s why I’m sad inside, I said I’d never cry
But I look in your eyes when I look in the mirror
One blink and then I tear up like

[Chorus]
Baby, I gotta drift away
I drift away so far away
Baby, I gotta drift away
I drift away so far away
Ooh ooh, ohh ohh
Ooh ooh, ohh ohh ohh
Ooh ooh, ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh ohh

[Interlude]
(Hey, we ain't done yet!)
And if mama was still alive
She would probably want me to shit, on
All of these rappers that think that they doin' some shit
Aww, that shit is cute, see that shit is cute
See that is the shit that make me wanna flip
And then stomp on a nigga like I was a Q
I thinks it’s my cue

Part 2

[Chorus]
Who would’ve thought that it’d be Julia’s bad son?
Who would’ve thought that it’d be Julia’s bad son?
Who would’ve thought that it’d be Julia’s bad son?

[Verse]
Have you ever been slept on so bad?
Every time you see a mattress, it just made your ass mad
So you stayed up late night, cookin' up a plan
Just to shit on everybody when they see that you the man
I’m just sayin', I was such a black sheep
I was just a nigga with a vision and some acne
I was tryna get it but I wouldn’t cause the system said I wouldn’t
But I still left the state when my PO said I couldn’t
And I still made that tape when my pockets said I shouldn’t
Fifty dollars and a one-way buddy pass bookin'
What’s behind me? I don’t know cause the back I’m never lookin'
Name a verse that I ain’t cookin', name a day that I ain’t pushin'
Name a opportunity that’s in my face that don’t get tooken'
Your favorite new rapper number 4, 3, 2 but I’m the one!

[Chorus]
Who would’ve thought that it’d be Julia’s bad son?
Who would’ve thought-

[Bridge]
You my boost of inspiration when I’m running out of hope
You my confidence and "Yes's" when the world is saying "No"
You the reason why I hustle you what keeps me on my toes
You a blessin' you a blessin' and I hate to see you go
You my boost of inspiration when I’m running out of hope
You my confidence and "Yes's" when the world is saying "No"
You the reason why I hustle you what keeps me on my toes
(At the end of the day, I still belong to you)
Hey mama (yahhh)
Hey mama (yahhh)
Hey mama
(At the end of the day, I still belong to you)

[Outro]
Mom, where you get them wings from pretty? Heh (Hey mama)
Where you get them wings from pretty? (Hey mama)
I see you got the same smile
But where you get them wings from pretty? Heh (Hey mama)
Where you get them wings from pretty?
Please don’t say that’s what I think it is
Where you get them wings from mom? (Hey mama)
Where you get them wings from pretty? (Hey mama)
Talk, talk (Hey mama)
Wings from pretty
