Im so disrespectful
I might wet u up
I keep Glock and pistols
And the tec and pump
If he wants some smoke
Then my niggas spark em
VV's in my chain
Might just have to spike em?
Damn Damn Damn Flexing hard
Damn Damn two pistols in the car
Damn Damn Wrist on aldemare
Damn DAmn flexing way to damn hard
I might wet his block
I might wet his car
We gone flip his bank?
That's another car
Use to do the scams
When rapping was to hard
I use to sell the grams
The backpack with the charge?
