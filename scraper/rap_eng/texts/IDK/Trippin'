[Chorus: Vancouver Sleep Clinic]
Now that you're with him
I don't know if I miss you
When the memory hits me
It just feels like I'm tripping
I know that you're with him
I don't know if I'm with you
When the memory hits me
It just feels like I'm tripping

[Verse 1: Vancouver Sleep Clinic]
Now I'm driving interstate
Got you song on replay
Don't like your vocal in the mix
It cuts through like a razor blade
I still see you everyday
Was gonna drop flowers at you place
But I think they died along the way
Just like nothing ever changed
You're with me like a plague
One that's got a pretty face
One I'm never gonna shake
I get these dreams when I'm awake
No tragedy, no remedy
If I'm insane, it's not medically
And you're with me, you're long gone
And I feel you from miles [?]

[Chorus: Vancouver Sleep Clinic]
Now that you're with him
I don't know if I miss you
When the memory hits me
It just feels like I'm tripping
I know that you're with him
I don't know if I'm with you
When the memory hits me
It just feels like I'm tripping

[Verse 2: Vancouver Sleep Clinic]
Faded, pass out
Wake up, trip out
Put me on a plane to anywhere
High Park, New York
[?] I went far
Everything just puts you into my head
I'm hanging by a thread
That's [?] for the end
Haven't gotten out of bed
I've been focused this year
Switch on, switch off
Lights on, lights off
You're with me, you're long gone
And I feel you from miles on, like

[Chorus: Vancouver Sleep Clinic]
Now that you're with him
I don't know if I miss you
When the memory hits me
It just feels like I'm tripping
I know that you're with him
I don't know if I'm with you
When the memory hits me
It just feels like I'm tripping

[Verse 3: IDK]
Yeah, bottom of the glass, bottom of the glass
Heart at the bottom of the glass, bottle made of brass
Only way to get rid of that is to drink, never smash
Think never pass, I'm in my head like we never last
I'm moving fast and the street never crash
Do the dash through the grass and I hope if I land, I'ma fall on it
I don't wanna do another fall without you
I don't wanna do another car that's not you
I don't wanna do another broad that's with you
Even though anytime we brawl, it's never physical
Pause is always digital, text is always difficult
Tweets are subliminal, I am the criminal
You are the good guy, we are no good, why?
We don't have good tries, so we are just goodbye

[Chorus: Vancouver Sleep Clinic]
Now that you're with him
I don't know if I miss you
When the memory hits me
It just feels like I'm tripping
I know that you're with him
I don't know if I'm with you
When the memory hits me
It just feels like I'm tripping
