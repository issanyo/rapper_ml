[Chorus]
It's the wave, it's the wave, it's the wave
Wave, it's the wave, it's the wave
Wave, it's the wave, it's the wave
Wave, it's the wave, it's the wave
I'm on my way, 5 minutes
I'm on my way, 5 minutes
I'm on my way, 5 minutes
I'm on my way, 5 minutes

[Verse 1]
These bitches got some issues, I don't need that
If she unresponsive Imma ease back
I don't give a fuck about your feedback
Most of yall opinions where my feet at, lean back
She asked where my team at, I'm like this the gang bitch
I live where your dream at
I live next to Mike Dean, my life feel like SciFi
I'm so fucking close, I could use the nigga wifi
My trajectory high high
Laughing at you niggas that was sleepin' like haha
One more time, haha
Three more times, haha
I remember high school when I used to steal from Prada
Trying to work at Five Guys
Nigga, I'm the shit, you ain't shit
I am it, you ain't this
You are mad, you are sad
Make excuses why I'm lit
Nigga get your money up, you got way too much time
I'm the shit, I ain't even in my prime but
It's the, it's the

[Chorus]
Wave, it's the wave, it's the wave
Wave, it's the wave, it's the wave
Wave, it's the wave, it's the wave
Wave, it's the wave, it's the wave
I'm on my way, 5 minutes
I'm on my way, 5 minutes
I'm on my way, 5 minutes
I'm on my way, 5 minutes

[Verse 2]
Hop out my lane, you will never be like me
You think you be shinin' cause them diamonds on your Jesus chain
You know you ain't shit, so you try to make me feel the same
You say you got bricks, where they at, oh in your brain
Motherfuckin' fraud, yous a motherfuckin' fraud
Tryna hop around my green, but I ain't a fan of frogs
Please don't talk, watch your jaw
Please don't talk, watch your jaw
And you say you got them guns, they like radadadada
When it's time to let 'em off, you like nanananana
You ain't really 'bout that life, you ain't even got a knife
Shit you wouldn't even fight, all them pictures on your gram
All that money and them straps got us thinking you the man
But instead you just a bitch (a bitch), a bitch (a bitch)
Got us thinking that you rich, shit
That's why I just keep it humble, all them niggas you look up to
Acting hard but don't want trouble
Tell the truth it's just the, just the, just the

[Chorus]
Wave, it's the wave, it's the wave
Wave, it's the wave, it's the wave
Wave, it's the wave, it's the wave
Wave, it's the wave, it's the wave
I'm on my way, 5 minutes
I'm on my way, 5 minutes
I'm on my way, 5 minutes
I'm on my way, 5 minutes
