[Intro: Jay IDK]
I look up to the sky then I pray the lord
That one day I’ll pop these bottles just because I’m bored
I pray I have a kid and a good wife
But if I’m stuck with a dyke I'll be alright

[Hook: Jay IDK]
She poppin Molly - shorty shot a white girl
(Damn!)
She poppin Molly - shorty shot a white girl
(Damn!)
If I could have one wish I would buy the world
If I could have one wish I would buy the world

[Verse 1: Jay IDK]
I’ll pull up in a whip you’ve never seen before
The rims look like my job was triple beaming, ho
But its never that
Since similac I never used to pack a gat
Matter fact, only thing I ever packed in my backpack was a four pack of bubble gum (quote that)
I used to sell it in the hallways
Just to buy a north face and a shirt from all daz
Bitch nigga that was all day
I used to grind like a mutherfucking roller blade
In elementary, I used to sell lemonade
In ninth grade, little nigga had to upgrade
To the Purp Haze
But selling drugs ain't for everyone - it only lasted four days
So I prayed
Dear god
I need a new car
Preferably a six
Twin Turbo
Super Charged
I need a couple hundreds just to throw it on some broads
And I promise to come to church
Right after this ménage

[Hook: Devin Cruise]
Today the sun was in my face
(La da da da da)
So I bought versace shades
(La da da da da)
I know I need to change
(La da da da da)
But I’d much rather stay the same

[Hook: Jay IDK]
She poppin Molly - shorty shot a white girl
(Damn!)
She poppin Molly - shorty shot a white girl
(Damn!)
If I could have one wish I would buy the world
If I could have one wish I would buy the world


[Verse 2: King Los]
Man, niggas ain’t had a wish since Brandy's brother
I wish a nigga with my shit tighter than any other
Your bitches don't really be dykin they be panty rubbers
I got a black on black benz I call that bitch Danny Glover
Or Whoopi
You whoop me it will feel like ya granny hung ya
Put arms around a nigga let his family touch ya
I be sonning these niggas they need family structure
You know family matters
I demand these suckers to fuck up
But what the fuck can I say, but fuck you butt fucks, have a fuckin nice day
Did your fuckin eyes play, tricks on you
Naw nigga
This a fuckin ice tray, on my wrist shittin on you
Ain’t hard paint job, on the whip was a grip
It was something in ya bitch mouth, wait it was a dick
It was mine
Get the sign
Get his picture
Get it signed
When she said hit rewind, motherfucker its my time
Turn up

[Hook]
Today the sun was in my face
(La da da da da)
So i bought versace shades

[Bridge: Jay IDK]
