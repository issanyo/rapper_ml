[Pt. I: How Long]

[Verse]
How long have I been a nigga?
Since the day I was born
Or since the day I decided a trigger would be the way to get all the money I get
Rob my brother for Benjamins then I spend them on kicks
Them Louboutins looking sick
In fact they make me look rich
In fact they make me get all the women, I mean every bitch
I got a watch that don't tick
I got a watch that don't tick
But if I walk out the house with it I'll be a lick for another nigga
How long has he been a nigga?
Since the day he was born
Or since the day he decided the liquor store by his house
Across the street from his school
Would be the same place he sold drugs and acted a fool
His father wasn't around
His mother was in the streets
Grandmother did what she could with barely nothing to eat
Just for the sneaks on your feet
He probably make you deceased
Fuck every priority
The money's the priority
The white man asked how long have we been some niggas?
Since the day we was born
Or since the day Martin Luther said that enough is enough?
We got to fight for our rights
But we to worried about seeing money that we losing sight
Of everything that's ahead of us
Only seeing in front us
We don't see what the money does
We just that the money is
The answer, the key, the false reality
The hope, the love, the only thing we need
In fact we need it so bad we make ourselves bleed
Green is the reason for my black mentality
That's how long I been a nigga
Since the Jackson's, the Lincoln's, the Washington's, the Hamilton's, the Jefferson's, the Franklin's
These are all white men
Shout out to Harriet Tubman
If it's true then maybe that'll bring change in the end
To the reason why I am a nigga

[Pt. II: Last Song 2]

[Hook]
Bitch niggas gone hate
Bitch niggas gone talk
Pussy niggas gone say
You are not what you are
Man shouldn't ever hate
Jigga man taught me that
The way the world looking now
It ain't a lot of men left

[Verse 1]
I just did another show
Packed it out the ratio
Half man, half hoes
I'm a just call it a [?]
Back when Justin use to drive in a Centura
That was his momma shit
That was back before I ever thought that I would be in LA trying to get that Obama dish
Waffle with chicken, no omelette

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
They gone say this Drake flow
But still know it's Jay though
I'm still getting paid though
Every time you scream hoe
Get the choppa, give them blocka
Middle finger
Fuck a problem
We gone solve them
Models here
Credit card, no limit
Silkk Da Shocka
We gone do it real big
For my momma

[Hook]

[Outro]
I ain't never been this happy recording music before bruh
Like these songs
I feel...When I'm recording them right now
This the first time I feel like while I'm recording them that I fuck with the shit
You know what I mean?
Like usually it just be like I record,record and then after it's done I'm like oh yea, this is tight or I don't like this
But this is the first time I'm recording it and I fuck with it
You get what I'm saying?
It ain't a lot of men left oh
Na na na na
I don't really have no verse for this to be honest
All I got is that (laughs)
That's all I got
I was still writing that joint
Fly the hook in
Bitch niggas gone hate
