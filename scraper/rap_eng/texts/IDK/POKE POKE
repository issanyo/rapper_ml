[Intro: IDK]
This that dirty, stinkin', nasty, ratchet, rowdy shit

[Chorus: IDK]
I ain’t tryna say I was a dope dealer (Dope dealer)
If the feds askin' questions, I don't know nigga (I don’t know nigga)
If you come around askin' for the smoke nigga (Smoke nigga)
You might get bang-bang, poke-poke
It ain't no joke

[Verse 1: IDK]
Both hands on my stick, watch me stroke (Ayy, yuh)
Put this stick on a lip, don't choke (Euh, euh)
They see gang comin' through, oh no (Oh no)
If she no longer safe, oh ho (Oh ho)
I ain't pickin' up for her (Brrp)
She already had a chance, she gon' have to suffer, bro (Okay)
She eat it like it supper, bro (Alright)
Then I see her friend over there, like what’s up with her?
Bitch I’m a dog, I could never be in love with her (Never be in love)
Yes I'm PG, but DC, I still fuck with them (Uh-huh, yup)
Bitch I want a big body Benz like a Tonka Truck (Skrrt, skrrt)
Got my new and my old ho playin’ tug-o-war

[Chorus: IDK]
I ain't tryna say I was a dope dealer
If the feds askin' questions, I don't know nigga
If you come around askin’ for the smoke nigga
You might get bang-bang, poke-poke
It ain't no joke

[Verse 2: Thirty Rack]
You don't like beef, well meet the goat nigga (Meet the goat)
Worth a couple M's, please don't choke nigga (Please don't choke)
Travel 'round the city, you want smoke nigga? (You want smoke?)
Finesser of the year, you hear Gulch nigga? (You hear Gulch nigga?)
You hear Gulch nigga? Yeah (Gulch), you hear Thirty nigga? (Thirty)
Got a crib to myself, young Ma-Culky nigga (Yeah)
Eighty on my wrist, why you poke a nigga? (Damn)
Three hundred on my neck, I'm the Pope nigga (I'm the Pope)
Don't get poked nigga, don't get smoked nigga (Smoked nigga)
Got a thirty on a Uzi, don't get smoked nigga (Don't get smoked nigga)
I'm the butcher of the shop, don't get chose nigga (Don't get chose nigga)
I'm eatin' toes nigga, bone marrow on rows nigga

[Chorus: IDK]
I ain't tryna say I was a dope dealer
If the feds askin' questions, I don't know nigga
If you come around askin' for the smoke nigga
You might get bang-bang, poke-poke
It ain't no joke
