(Verse 1)
Damn
This shit too wavy
Cute and lightskin so that bitch want my baby
This my lil intro so don’t get too crazy
Chillin with my niggas fuckin shit up on the daily like woah
(damn)
Nut in my Glock so i buss at these niggas
These niggas make threats but they not pullin triggers
They talk all that shit but it ain’t no go figure like woah
(oh my god nigga)
Don’t give a damn bout a hoe or a sucka
These lames they gon y’all off just like they chris tucker
But me and my gang we gon blow like mark zucker like woah
(hol up what)
Back on the beat like a part 2
Lames they gon bite the whole flow like a shark tooth
Shoutout the real fuck a fake like who are you
Niggas want smoke but the pack concealed
(uh huh)
Don’t fuck with lean keep that shit concealed
Up the pole so it gon feel like i work out
I ain’t gon cap you i got niggas that work out
Yea i’m type goofy but don’t be mistaken
Cut up the beat like i’m freddy or jason
(what)
I can't keep 1 girl so don’t get ya hoe taken
As real as it gets ain’t no corn cause no flakin like woah

(Outro)
Fuck manser nigga
That was a freestyle by the way
I stuttered...
But it’s whatever man
I’m just rollin with it
I’m out
