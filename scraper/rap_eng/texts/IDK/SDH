[Intro: Jay IDK]
These girlies thinking that the liq’ is sweet
They thinking I'm a fool and they can play with me
The reason why I only want one thing
And if they want commitment or my dough I tell em

[Hook: Jay IDK]
No no no no no
No no no no no
No no no no no
No no no no no

[Post Hook: Jay IDK]
I smoke a doobie just to ease the pain
While praying that this substance do not escalate
I'll even sell it just to pay tuition
And if the Feds is listening and they ask I'll tell em

[Hook]

[Post Hook: Jay IDK]
The teacher lecturing another class, but I done fell asleep so I ain't even catch it
I asked the nerd to the left of me
If I could see his notes and he replied and told me

[Hook]

[Verse: Jay IDK]
Whilst y'all was probatin’
I was on Probation
While y'all was relay racing, I was dough chasin
Trying to make up for all the time that was much
Wasted from drinking no chasing
Ending up in the bathroom throwing up
Was the story of my life when trying to go to college
Trying to gain some knowledge
But ended up getting Knowledge
From another type of brain, but still she was a scholar
Holler
If you understand what I'm saying my man
My momma graduated and was working on her masters
With a good job, so middle class is what they classed us
But in reality a nice house don't mean shit, if you can't afford to keep the lights lit
So I spit, ‘till you mutherfuckers tell me I’m the shit
And I’ll shit
Cuz these unauthentic rappers ain't legit
Maryland
Gone fuck with me when they hear me y'all ain't hear me
When I said my mouth a Shotty
Now this shit’s a fucking semi
Bow!
