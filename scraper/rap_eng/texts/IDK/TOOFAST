VERSE1
Talking too fast, I’m doing my best
How do i rest when everything crashed
Driving too fast i’m always late
Better be safe, babe, whatever we play
I’m always bad but bad is my best
How do i rest when everything crashed
Driving too fast, I’m always late
You underplay babe, whenever we play

CHORUS
Talking to her
Thinking it’s over
What i got to do
When time is blooming
Talking to her
Thinking is over
Everytime confused
Thought that we were closer

IDK VERSE 2
I visualised everything i wanted inside
When i seen it it started to strive
Then my visions started to thrive
Everybody told me that i was the bad guy
And them orange jumpsuits saying help so i tried
To do right just to prove to myself
That i could the things that i never really knew by myself
And that's the day that i discovered i was true to myself
And kept chuffing at something that was due to my wealth
And now i'm doing okay
I remember when my mama used to tell me you can go play
It felt like yesterday
And now today i'm a grown man
I live by my own plan i'm steering my own ship
I'm living my old man

CHORUS 2
Talking to her
Thinking it's over
What i got to do
When time is blooming
Talking to her
Asking her over
Everytime confused
My time is blooming

VERSE3
Talking too fast, I’m doing my best
How do i rest when everything crashed
Driving too fast i’m always in late
Better be safe, whatever we play
Talking too fast, I’m doing my best
How do i rest when everything crashed
Driving too fast i’m always in late
Better be safe, whatever we play

CHORUS 3
Talking to her
Thinking it's over
Everytime confused
When time is blooming
Talking to her
Asking her over
Everytime confused
Thought that we were closer
