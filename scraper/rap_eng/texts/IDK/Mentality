[Verse 2]
Louis V case
Wit some Louis V gloves
And an Audemar watch
With a jacket up above
On that jacket is heart
But it don't stand for love
Comme des Gar√ßons
What it really is
What it was
Was a nigga with money that me
All my diamonds make you Stevie Wonder make you can't see
All my diamonds make you Stevie Wonder make you can't see
All my diamonds make you Stevie Wonder make you can't see
Mmhm
Visvim shoes
Cuz a nigga real fly
Got a bad down to earth
Yellow bone by my side
With the money in her eyes
And the thick thick thighs
And you know she down to ride
Cuz you know that all my diamonds make you Stevie Wonder make you can't see
All my diamonds make you Stevie Wonder make you can't see
All my diamonds make you Stevie Wonder make you can't see
All my diamonds make you Stevie Wonder make you can't see
Daddy!
