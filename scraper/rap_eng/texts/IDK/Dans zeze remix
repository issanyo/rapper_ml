When it comes TO domestic policy
He's fighting for equality
It's possibly an oddity
To have that ideology
War over commodities
In a proprietary colony
He still fought for equality
Farewell a-dress
Complicated like chess
After it was said and done it was no work in progress
And you know it made an impact
Said some things about the future that should be in contract
But that's not impor-tant
I just wish they believed enough in it to support it
Foreign interactions
Washington was making bank
Not credit card transactions
SENT  his men to britain
On a mission
You know that he didn't
Ask permission
They wanted to form a
Coalition

Only thing he didn't want was prohibition
Wrong move holding on to the fort
It is   clear they shouldve Abort-ted
Other than that made few mistakes
Thats why he was well support-ed
