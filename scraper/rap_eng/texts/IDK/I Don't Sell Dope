[Intro: IDK]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't want the money if the money isn't fast
I don't want the money if the money isn't fast
I don't want the money if the money isn't fast
I don't want the money if the money isn't fast

[Chorus: IDK]
I don't sell dope, no, more
I don't sell dope, no, more
I don't sell dope, no, more
But, they still call my phone, ay
I don't want the money if the money isn't fast
I don't want the money if the money isn't fast

[Verse: Lil Gnar]
She a thot, got the extra molly, uh
All this guap, can't even count it, uh
Fell in love with choppa sounds, uh
Money is the root of evil, but
Evil shit to feed my people shit
Split the dope, and split the profit, uh
They on dick, cos' I got rich, woah
Lil Gnar, big guap, bih'
Ice on my bracelet, uh
Scary like Jason, more like the Matrix, uh
Servin' that weight like a waiter
Smokin' the gas, it delay ya', uh
Bitch, I be high, elevated, uh
No, I don't care what you sayin', hoe
Bitch beamin', shutup and pay me
No time for wastin'
Bitch, I could die any day

[Chorus: IDK]
I don't sell dope, no, more
I don't sell dope, no, more
I don't sell dope, no, more
But, they still call my phone, ay
I don't want the money if the money isn't fast
I don't want the money if the money isn't fast
I don't sell dope, no, more
I don't sell dope, no, more
I don't sell dope, no, more
But, they still call my phone, ay
I don't want the money if the money isn't fast
I don't want the money if the money isn't fast
