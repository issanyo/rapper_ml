[Intro: Denzel Curry]
A nigga really done fucked up now
Lemme catch my breath, finna hold my breath
Yo Power, this a really great beat, good job

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry & IDK]
Get it and go, stack up my dough
Bitch eat my dick like a meatball hero
Black on my body like Neo
I been had the sauce, I'm the new Tapatío
The fuck is a tío? Terrell Owens
Fuckin' bitches barely knowin' them
Sometimes I feel suicidal
Shout out to my nigga $crim
Bang, no Chiddy, run it up like Giddy
Better not fuck with me, Zeltron 6 Billi'
Got the rock like Milly, get cent like 50 (yeah)
Better not talk shit when I got goons with me
I got the power (Right), but I'm not a Ranger (Yeah)
Got the beat by Power (Right) and we just made a banger

[Verse 2: IDK]
Get it and go, I'll stomp your ass to the ground
If you think you can fuck with my flow
Open the door, I do not walk through that muh'fucker
If they not talkin' no dough
I don't smoke dro, I barely drink
Pour up that coffee for niggas that sleep
Used to sell quarter of ounces of stink
I make a quarter a show if you blink
You couldn't see what I saw, now you peep
Now they on D, I hit the flea flicker
You should've seen quicker, I'ma just Ether him
I'ma just Ether him, make 'em see heater, son
I'm a say I'm the dad, niggas from Trinidad
Come with that choppa' that don't need no helipad
Hit your ass, pop pop, and now you irrelevant
Pop up the trunk and I don't mean an elephant
I'm talkin' stacks, you talkin' bricks
All of the rhymes you rap ain't legit
I catch a case, I plead the fifth
You catch a case, you bring the clique
I'm not the type to lose sleep for a bitch
I might just fuck for a week then I quit
I might just cop me a Rollie that don't lose the value
And trade in the shit for a crib

[Chorus: IDK]
Get it and go, your bitch is a hoe
She sent me a flick when I flick on my phone
Get it and go, your bitch is a hoe
She sent me a flick when I flick on my phone
Hit it and go, I pass her to bro
He shoot his shot and I bet he gon' score
Hit it and go, I pass her to bro

[Verse 3: ZillaKami]
Bitch, I don't got no respect for opposition
Casket and it don't show with dirty feelings
Blood on my blunt, you get the picture
Blaze carry blades with tetanus, so don't get shot
Y'all think your Majin gettin' booed off stage
Writing books like me, you ain't on my page
Grey 5-9 apes, we sell waves
Bitch, you won't act tough with a gun in yo' face
I pull up with a red light, nigga, what's up?
Nigga tryna peel off like, "Oh shit, fuck"
When the buckshots spray, better duck or have luck
All my dogs got fed when the moon comes up
Wit' a pit bull off its leash
It's the Wardog boss, real shit
They never break, they form, stay a milli'
When the clip go off, what's up?

[Chorus: IDK]
Get it and go, your bitch is a hoe
She sent me a flick when I flick on my phone
Get it and go, your bitch is a hoe
She sent me a flick when I flick on my phone
Hit it and go, I pass her to bro
He shoot his shot and I bet he gon' score
Hit it and go, I pass her to bro
He shoot his shot and I bet he gon', bet he gon'

[Verse 4: Zombie Juice]
I just jumped back like I'm on one
Look what you did, bitch, you owe us somethin'
I'm just the guy, like just get it done
Smokin' gelato, got plenty sons
You like Juwanna Mann, I like designer fame
Tats on my chest, rep' the Zombies man
All on that bitch like a sonogram
I be that nigga, that Hall of Fame
Look at yourself, we are not the same
High as a pit like I'm on a plane
Fuckin' that bitch like they all the same
Ain't nun' with Juice
I'm drunk off the booze with a thou' on the shoes
I just won't lose, niggas is fool, swag
I'm rockin' the blue fur
I like that bitch right there, think I'm gon' like, her

[Chorus: IDK]
Get it and go, your bitch is a hoe
She sent me a flick when I flick on my phone
Get it and go, your bitch is a hoe
She sent me a flick when I flick on my phone
Hit it and go, I pass her to bro
He shoot this shot and I bet he gon' score
Hit it and go, I pass her to bro
He shoot his shot and I bet he gon', bet he gon'
Get it and go, your bitch is a hoe
She sent me a flick when I flick on my phone
Get it and go, your bitch is a hoe
She sent me a flick when I flick on my phone
Hit it and go, I pass her to bro
He shoot his shot and I bet he gon' score
Hit it and go, I pass her to bro
He shoot his shot and I bet he gon', bet he gon'
