[Intro]
This feels good right here, I like this
Uh-huh, yeah, uh
Check it, look

[Verse 1: IDK]
Riddle me this and riddle me that
If the contract look like a riddle, I'll give you a slap
The contract look like a Skittle, I'll give you the dap, that's sweet
I'ma sign, just show me where the pen at
I've been that, I've been back from where the Big Ben sat
Big venues packed and stacked from the way that I rap
The way that I'm killin' this track, judge gon' give me the max
She held her plans to play me tight until I hit her with sacks
She fumbled, now the ball's in my court, pause
You tryna spoon while I fork
You use your face and eat it like a dog
I bend it over, then I'm facin' and adjacent to the ceiling fan
As I fuck her off the wall
She don't stop 'til I get enough
I don't stop 'tilI get a nut
You callin', tryna interrupt
Your career is sippin' cups
His career is hickin' up
My career is take the hole beverage isle and stick it up

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
You just ain't fly enough
Who told y'all niggas y'all was live as us?
You smell that sticky when I'm ridin' up
Plus, I probably got somethin' with me if i'm ridin' up
Tappin' that wave on some Poseiden stuff
I live my one life, you coward niggas die too much
Spent my real like for those feelin' like me, and I inspire such
Every day we the snakes on my circle tighten up
Can't heal for the life of us
All my life been dyin' to buy in and raise the prices up
Your fuckin' bar ain't high enough
I took the bar and turned it to a pull up bar
Pull up in all kind of shit, I be in designer shit
'Cause really I design the shit
I don't fuck with rappers 'cause rappers be on vagina shit

[Verse 3: IDK]
I'll mistake you for a bitch and get behind this shit
That happens here when half of y'all can't seem to find your dick
Don't confuse how they be cryin' for they sinuses
'Cause they the type to walk inside a stall and use they hine to piss
I'm on top like the peak of pyramid, hieroglyphs
Break a beer and draw on your face with pieces of Heineken
Then apologize and hope everything will fine again
See I be off my coo-coo, I guess it was bad timing then
