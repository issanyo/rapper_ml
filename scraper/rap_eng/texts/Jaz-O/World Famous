[Hook]
It's the world's famous MOP, Firing Squad
It's home team in the motherfucking house
No question

[Verse 1]
It's the world's famous MOP doing our thing
Recruiting and saluting real niggas like Boo Bang
Billy Danze, hard to notice when I'm mellow
Making moves smoother than Jimmy Fingers in Goodfellow
Never gassed to do
What I have to do
Splashing you, blasting you
Taking your stash from you
Internat-ional, bell ringa ruckus bringa
Downtown Swinga, exercising my index finga
Saying whassup to the people that though we'd desert em
Hardcore was raw but we got more to hurt em
Firing Squad all up in your district
Last album was foul
But yet some missed it
Bet they gon' get with this shit
Who's in the house
It's the last generation
Real ill niggas from the field you'll be facing
Ninety-six flavor for your neighbor, how you like us now?
Bluckka, bluckka, b-bluckka, b-bluckka, bluckka, bloaoow!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Bust it, who stepped out the woodworks and give
Villains Vietnam flashbacks of doin all that hood dirt
The M. O. P still banging
What's strange ain't nothing changed
Them bells still rangin
You wanna be drug dealing
Fuck killing, wack rappers are foul
And plus that shit you talk is out of bounds
Ask yourself is you ready for action packed in
Getting blasted with your whole ribcage crashed in
I'm outspoken
Niggas language is broken
Record labels need to stop that wack shit they be promoting
See me knowin me G I drop physical science
This lethal rap appliance'll fuck up your whole alliance
This is the way we bring things
Check out how we swing things
M.O.P. be having shit jumping way up in Sing-Sing
A new star is born, peace to Teflon
I'mma blow up the East when we release the bomb

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]
Same niggas got my back and
Still blue steel we're packin
Same hardcore raps and
Still focused on makin it happen, whattup
They wanna see us
Tell em hold on
M.O.P. is back and, that's one to grow on
The four pound move
Rugged rounds that down fools
Rough enough to make the whole fucking ground move
Representing and it ain't playing War Games
With nothing to lose
I put him on snooze and blow out his brains
Kick back and watch how it go down
We here so beware, prepare for the throwdown
Crooklyn Crooks, is the ones that blew em
We live in it so I'mma give it to em
Bring it to em raw, that's how you bring it
Bring it to em raw, let the real nigga swing it
Bring it to em raw
Give it to em ruff rugged and fat
Where you at
Where you at
Where you at
Where you at

[Hook x4]
