[Intro: Jaz-O]
Understand the moment
Stop everything
The Originator
The alpha and omega
[Jay-Z]
We at 80 right now Jaz, we almost at 100
[Jaz-O]
The first and the last
That's right, I am here
Kings County
We outside y'all, let's go niggas

[Jaz-O]
God's here, the Aston parked here
Chicks in the cut in just the brazierres
In this at-most-phere
Yo ass cross here
It's yo night shorty, get your lip glossed smeared
Toss the panties, this is, Marcy family
This is, Kings County you hear me, Spring through Fall
Ain't nothing po' but this alcohol (for real)
My number's complicated algebra
I lean in cars, lean off Bacardi dark
Shorty wit a mean ass lean on yours
She's on fours
Three in the morn'
For me the bomb, and she going down and out
Next day wanna meet me in town I'm out
I think I made her cross-eyed, when I hit her broad side
My name haunts chicks, train the thought
My dick stick in they mind, run a train on they thoughts

[Hook x2]
To my (playas get ya dollas)
Like its no tomorrow, all my (ladies in Manolo)
Respect game you follow
Can I grub, read
Show, love, to, my, thugs
And all my women to succeed, let's go!

[Jay-Z]
Hov!
Big Pimpin'
Walk wit a small limp an'
I'm here to scoop you broads
Out ya mid-size cars
Bring ho's out the closet, my dough give chicks motive
You got enough money to unfold it
But one thing you can say about Jay it's not a day I ever bought it
You can audit my life
I put that on my unborn daughter's life
All I give 'em is game
I don't give 'em my name
Chicks leap through hoola-hoops to get in the flame
All it takes it Cristal juice to get in they pants, man
Ain't nothing gon' change bout Hov but my socks, my drawers
And my Rocawear clothes
And of course the flows
So pretty soon I'll be able to rap in Morse code (beep beep beep beep)
Please believe me
But enough about Jay, my resume speaks for itself
Getcha keys, we leavin'

[Hook x2]

[Dibiase]
Girls grillin', but haters do less scopin'
Dibi's like tennis, I got the US Open
And I don't say a lot but when it's time to yap
They callin' me cough syrup for all the dimes I tap
The Rollie? No, might see the Tellurium
Waves got 'em nauseous might catch delirium
Got broads changing, putting 'em on learning
Levis? No, put on them Ron Hermans
Last week a handball switching on the Polo
Nine West, eehh, switch 'em to Manolos
The reason why girls wanna switch they plans
See Dibiase once and wanna ditch they man
Acting like Dib ain't really in the room
'til I'm rising to the top like a helium balloon
Like forget brain, step it up to cranium
It's crazy, her ball game kept it up in stadiums

[Hook x2]
