G-Force (what's up Slay?)
I need you to make a hit for me (talk to me)
Four suspects (who?)
Busta Rhymes, Layzie Bone (who else?)
Twista, Jaz-O (I got ya)
There they go, take the shot!
Take the shot! DAMN!
When I come and I hop and I skip and I rhyme
And I dumb and I drop and I spit and I shine
Ay-ay-ay nigga what you really wanna do?
You ain't knowin' that I'm comin' to take what's mine
Every time I come to hit'cha
With a little bit of killa
Better know that you can never
Never see me little nigga
While I'm at the TOP
I will never STOP
When a nigga POP
See the way I run it, and leave a nigga bitter
Y'all know when I do my thing and I bang
Bidi-boom with a bomb and a BING!
Everybody know that when it comes to the shit I gotta spit
Motherfucker better crown me KING!
With a passion and a lot of action
See the way ya grab 'em, HOW YOU DO IT!
Then they wanna ask him
How a nigga smash 'em
See the way ya have 'em, DRAG 'EM TO IT!
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-HEY!
Now you gotta know what a nigga do all day
Count bread make a nigga wanna bounce heads when I drop heat in these streets, okay?
You shitty with a get'cha gimmick
And I hope a lot of niggas live near a clinic
It don't really matter who you wanna ask about me
Cause I be the fiercest with it
While I'm givin' you the final chapter
With a lot of laughter
See the way I capture
Everybody probably tellin' you the same shit you don't really wanna come after!
Now I suggest you listen whenever you hear that I be up in the buildin'
Trust me, this is not the place for you to bring yo' children


The B-O-N-E we got plenty of flows;
From Cleveland, Ohio we rollin' on vogues
They told me this record was only for pros
So Layzie gon' get in M.V.P. I suppose
Foes slammin' them Cadillac do's
My story the coldest that ever been told
Sit back while I tell it, it's thuggish we blaze
Forever I'm young and it'll never get old
Poppin' a bottle of Ros√© when I ball
Smell the aroma, just follow your nose
We thug on the corner from night 'til the sun up
You run up get done up, I'll let it explode
Blow only where gangstas roll, so
Homie we smash around and we crash collide
Whoever don't wanna be foes, oh
O.G. status, still got money up under the mattress
Nigga come get it I'll stick like cactus
Money so tall those niggas need ladders
Try to come close but they never could match us
So catch us, we the masters
Y'all already know how we do it on the Clair
Never compare we livin' on stretchers
Willin' to bet ya, when I twist and bust
Nigga come through with Twist and Bust
Nigga been famous they know to aim it
They spittin' my language, "Adrenaline Rush"
Feminine niggas that been on a rush
Back to the dust we winnin' the clutch
Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit!
Now I be the coldest on the island, country or on the peninsula
Hit them with the venom and then I'mma
Disintegrate 'em or fade 'em, fuck 'em cause I hate 'em
I'm hot if you not check the temperature
Mayday one Kay Slay, drop the bomb on 'em when they put me on the track and I'mma
Show 'em who was out when I make 'em go and commit suicide dressed like a Phantom or
Do and I'm about to get dinner
I'mma open the do'
Cause I'm dope with the flow
Never know how flow was the 'dro
I'mma eat a bitch up and I hope for some mo'
So long is the poem, I'm never a ho
You can go check the portfolio
Kay Slay 'em just after fuck at you and then I'mma stick 'em
You know we can go
I'm cold so go get your coat
This be the season for niggas that's sneezin' and snoozin'
And if you keep testin' me you gon' be catchin' a beatin' and bruisin' - what's up?
Look at the mojo and look at the swag, get a look at all the vernacular
Things I be doin' cause I'mma stay infamous so they be callin' me Dracula
Oops I mean Blackula when I'm attackin' ya
Pullin' up on 'em up in the new Acura
Or new pre-Camaro or new super Lego with the Pinot Grigio seats
I see when you niggas be hatin', so the next time when you see me don't speak
Now you know not to send me no beat
Cause I'mma kill it
And murder anybody that'll wanna get it
Where they wanna get up in it 'cause I be the realest
I'm a menace all the way up to the finish
Make an enemy diminish
When I get up in the battle even if it gotta be up on the block
2010 hip-hop, the shit don't stop
Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit!
What can it be?
Rappers and thuggin' on beats
None of 'em keepin' it street
Look at them calves, all of them wanna be bulls
None of 'em ready for beef
What about me?
Been through the pain
Sorted the lames, keep it the same
Skillful syllables kill
My rhymin' technique is impeccable still
Anybody ever wanna run up
Will get done up in a hurry
Got a flurry
I'mma hunt 'em for the come up
With a bang you better run from the one until you permanently feel it
I will live it, idiots gettin' it
"The Originator," gotta keep it greater
Keep the fader for the haters
Nigga real for real
The all-time thriller, ready rockin' the death of it definite
On it cookin' and cheffin' it (ooh!)
Takin' over the world
I'm making off with your girl
Motherfucker recognize the nigga Hugh Heff'in it
Doin' what you never did at double time, triple time president
Ain't nobody better in the residence
Cream of the crop, seein' it stop
Over the top, bringin' the soul makin' it pop
Got a old school banger make you do the wop
Got a Louisville slugger make you diddy-bop
Ever incredible gotta keep it way ahead of you
Screamin' at my niggas in the clink doin' federal
No trip, no travesty
I call the lick now I'm up like anti-gravity
Spit words from the brain like charity
If hip-hop was a broad she'd marry me
Gotta keep it gutter, gotta get the bread, gotta get the butter
Make it hot, you can toast word to mother

Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit!
