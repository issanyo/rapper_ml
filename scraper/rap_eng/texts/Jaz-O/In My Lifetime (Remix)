[Intro]
"In my lifetime"
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
It's the thought of a ride that make my eyes wide, I'm caught up
I'm tryna make all of my dreams materialize, so I sorta
Say my goodbyes to the straight and narrow
I found a new route, you 'bout to see my life change
I make the means justify the ends
I make the cream, materialize keys to a Benz
And so I'm rollin'
For now, holdin' down the fort, who's controllin'?
The ground's gotta blow 'em, yep, y'all shoulda told 'em
Uhh, my first felony's approachin'
Copped my first key, took a freeze, now I'm frozen
I bought a black MAC, I'm outta control
Losin' bankrolls on blackjack, you gotta know
It always crossed my mind
That Feds be tappin' the lines like Gregory Hines
Still on the phone, discussin' my biz like it could never be mines
I know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights
Still my blood flows ice, it's just my life

[Chorus]
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I'm like the bass with the ass, splashin' cold cash
The Big Willie get you chilly when I pass, brrrrrr
Is it, just a mirage all these girls thankin' God?
Is this, world my world? Am I the star of stars?
Baby, pimped out, I'm gettin' too large and smokin' cigars
All chicks is hollerin' about Jig-ga, the whole city's buzzin'
Wasn't checkin' for me a dozen or so, months ago
Now I'm all they know, I'm a person (yeah)
Lettin' the Cristal's breathe at the Barnacle Bar
Under my sleeve, vernacular, 50 G's
I'm talkin' big cheese, you gotta be down to dig these (uhh)
Uhh, give me a rush like you wouldn't believe
My head's about to bust, acceleratin' what drives me
Hope I don't gotta die to see, see, I can't lie to me
I know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights
Still my blood flows ice, it's just my life

[Chorus]
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Uhh, from the beginnin', see, we never seen the endin'
Runnin' up in all the women, all the linen, all the jewels, huh
We sported Pele's, gold diamonds and Pirelli's
Sports cars, the good life'll give you a belly
But that's cool, as I zone in the Al Capone, watch me
'Cause the Medusa's head on Versace turned me to stone
Now my poems just ain't poems, they bloody when I recite 'em
Bones get disconnected like the phones
Now, I'm a hardened criminal with game
Like the Garden, all my penpals life controlled by the warden
Still the thrill makes me blind to the fact
I could do real time, I'm a prisoner of my crimes
Know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights
Now I'm incarcerated for my life

[Chorus]
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
