~why do i pretend hard ? Like I have no feelings
Probably because some turned on me 
That’s just one reason - I think about it everyday -
I pray for em anyways , those who think I don’t must not know me anyway . See I’m sorta like a rose , dipped in gold 
With some rough pe-tals you can’t ignore 
But I promise you , Won’t ,refuse
You , Won’t refuse. X2

You can do your thang 
You can do what-Eva 
You can make it rain or you can change the weather
But i won't restrict you , i will fix
You .  BABY  i know this , BABY i show this 

The rose will grow Every day (anyway)
Ruff around the edges that’s what make you perfect ( X3 )

The rose will grow Every day (anyway)
The rose will grow anyway , through the rain and cloudy days , homie keep it pushing I had worser days . I stay grounded , cooling catching rays , just don’t pay no mind ,just go with the wind . You can free your mind ,/ just gotta go within 
( E-E-EMOTIONS AND ALL )
You , Won’t refuse. X2

Divine rose , dipped in gold 
The rose will grow Every day (anyway)
Ruff around the edges that’s what make you perfect ( X3 )

The rose will grow Every day (anyway)
