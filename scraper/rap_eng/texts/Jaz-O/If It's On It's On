[Intro: Ja Rule]
Who this? Who we representing?
Motherfucking Top Dawg, nigga (nigga!)
You know what I'm saying?
I don't think y'all understand!
But yo, I'ma let y'all know

Verse 1: Ja Rule
Spare yourself the reality of an ass whippin'
That I'm giving when I be getting tight and start flippin’
On you bitch ass niggas that like forming them cyphers
It gets me hyper, on the real I'ma slice ya
Light ya ass up with sixteen or more
Slugs coming from my snub-nosed bulldog
Raw to the core, let's lay down some laws
This is Ja’s house, bow down or bring the war
Motherfuckers, ya’ll don't wanna touch what's hot
What it ever be, the mic, the Glock, the drug spot
Like a bitch, scared of life and taking chances
And right now, you’re showing more ass then exotic dancers
The answer is this, niggas don’t want to touch
Ja live, stronger than a fucking coke rush
See, on the streets, I’ll be killing niggas like cash got
Shit in the smash, blunts leaks with hash

[Verse 2: Infa-Red]
Now I’m on a planet called dark in these streets I spark
3-2 get your ass sticked, so fuck a part
The enemy is in me, plus I take no prisoners
Nigga is crazy, caught up getting stabbed by their little sisters
Now I’m in my own world, I sell girls with pearls
Who sip Dom P, a half a pound of ?
I roll up on Lennox, in a Lex with tenants
Go in the gambling spot with a knot, soles stomping up what's in it
I heard the nigga say short paper
But I let most get left with them hoes, I see them bitches later
I’m in the motherfucking streets full of creeps and freaks
I sell rocks on blocks where the hustlers never sleep
I’m in too deep and I can’t get out, cause it’s all about the clout
Sticking dicks in these bitches mouth
I'm I-N-F-A-R and E-D, I’m from the UPT
Automatically, you can't fuck with me

[Bridge:]
That's how we do it in the 95'
It's do or die in this game, sit back and wonder why
The game is trife, the creeps creep at night
In the rap game, fake niggas get sliced

[Verse 3: Chris Black]
I sold my soul to the streets
By pumping cracks & packing heat
Scrapin' G’s where my 9 speak, your knees get weak
That calico feel so sweet, Shredding through your meat
I’m the maker now meet defeat
The shit was planned while bagging grams, whip scrams
I’ll be damned if a bitch infiltrate the fam
Class cot, clique's tight like Fort Knox
It’s war time, motherfucker, pull your heat out your ice box
My crews clicking, black tots we pitching
Catch an ass whipping, or a slug if you get to snitching
You's a bitch and I can sense fear in your heart
So I spurt, crept on your crew left a dart

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
Giuliani's got me and my crimies thinking grimy
Can’t hustle no more, got to get this money through muscle for sure
Me and my wildlife, youngins running up, gun it up
Staked out your money spot, then done it up
With gunplay, you faggots forfeit, you won Jay
Just let a nigga live to see his son, someday
Shut up, no compassion, kept blasting
Shit, you will never catch me slipping’ sipping Mo'
It’ll be no revenge, I tie up all loose ends
Strictly business, the worst witnesses
It's you and your dead friends
I don’t just hit you with nouns, unlike these other rappers
This shit I spit'll make you hit the ground
When I sci-fi ‘Kappa Kappa’, the step show starts
Even in the barbershop, you don’t want no part (nigga)

[Verse 5: Blackchild:]
I’ve been living illegitimate since I could hold my dick
Financially I’m fit, mentally I’m sick
This rap shit might keep me from doing sticks
And blowing up bricks on neighborhood strips
I put holes in niggas' souls, for real
Me and my 9 mil love to rob and steel
And my Mac 10’s my best friend
Ever since we been sticking up y’all niggas like skins
And cooking up coke for the people that smoke
I pull out my gat and everybody get ghost
Cause Blackchild got a style that’s awkward
The Mac is what I walk with, shots is what I talk with
I live life like it ain’t no tomorrow
My heart is hollow, I feel no sorrow
Or pity for nobody in this fucked up city
I get pissy and then get busy, you know who is he


[Verse 6: Nemesis:]
Fuck that clown ass rapping
Got two others on burn, now watch it happen
Street level attacking, challenges lacking
Raw listenin' satisfaction, slugs from the calibers deaded
Know your action, friend, that ass can't win
Fuck the rap level and take it to a Mac 10
Where the war begins and ends son
I stand blasting, eradicating niggas in a violent-like fashion
Your shit’s petty, like robbing banks in Manhattan
While I’m power-moving cross-seas to the the Vatican
Pass me the Reagan nephew,the over view injector
Is the only wayto perfect a hallucinating toxic style
Niggas watch it closely, now you think twice when you approach me
The mischievous, smoking niggas' ass cracks like cannabis
Rap is a bitch so I lust for my clique
Stash of raw dope, uncut bomb shit
Niggas catch fits, get fucked like chicks
Real niggas bleed chocolate because they so saltless
Bodying niggas, and say motherfuck the charges

[Verse 7: Dmx:]
A cruddy nigga, going up raw dog in dirty bitches
And if I get burned, I’m giving that shit to 30 bitches
You say you know a nigga like me, guess again papi
Cause I might smile up in your face but I ain't your friend papi
Jump out the 1500 like run it
Niggas don’t want it, get it, done it, when I’m blunted
However it went down, I made it happen, I made it scrappin’
I made it fussing, busting, I made it capping
And letting off wasn’t nothing new to a nigga
Something to do to a nigga, cause you's a fool nigga
I know your type, you hype all up off that fake shit
And can’t understand why a man would have to take shit
Or steal shit, but this is that real shit, niggas kill shit, peel shit
I hit you in your head, you won’t feel shit
Err, Let the dogs loose on a nigga's ass
Find out if the nigga’s faster than the trigger blast
A fucking saint in the truest form
Knowing damn well that what I do is wrong, but still I do it strong
Niggas is making movies, but I got's to stop production
I need a block to function and maybe I’ll stop destruction
Cause blocks are not for fronting
So let me get that Shorty, cause you don’t need that Shorty
You don’t know what to do with that Shorty
You may as well hit this 40 just before you hit the floor
Another 24. What you want, money? More?!
