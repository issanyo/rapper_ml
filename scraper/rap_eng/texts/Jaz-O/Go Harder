(Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard)
You knew I was coming nigga
(Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard)
Yeah
(Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard)
What ?
(Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard)
Listen Up
M-A-R-C-Y, I blash back hold back
M-A-R-C-Y, I blash back hold back

This is a J sporter, black British walker, fox ? collar
Quarter field three quarter
A quiet menace ? the bed stuy borders
With a hottie named shottie, with her nose ? off her
The Marcy phenom, the ? with the king don
? of being a hater , motherfucker dream on
Them streets ain't with cha, half moon head nigga
Just regurgitated what I spoon fed, nigga
You then compare yourself to Jackie Robinson, you jack and rob and sin on your own family and friends
Blood money, kill charges and man ?
You dodge the pen, but can’t steal my fan base
Let's put things in its' proper place That ‘S’ on your chest
Son give it a rest…
This is a dark side and this is doom stya
And I can't even put on record what the goons say
Stop lyin', come to grips, moma work double shifts so you ? for food and scoop milk for ?
Protected by the brothers but you branched out
Cut throats, Made new alliances, just so you can stand out
You talk tough but your gun ain't speak
Real G's held you down, you were stupid and weak
The truth uncovered, low life I love it
