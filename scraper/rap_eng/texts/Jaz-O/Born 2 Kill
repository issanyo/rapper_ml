Represent, show niggas the deal
I'm packing my blue steel, keeping it real
Cause niggas were born to kill

[Lil Fame]
Here comes the Brownsville slugger, motherfucker
I bust off shots at fools
To avoid these obstacles
I roll deep, me and my nigga Llama
With about seven niggas thats up in the clip to bring the drama
Homicide, take a ride in the hearse
Enemies out to hit me, but I'mma see em first
I'm ready, steady, and deadly but yet nervous
Let my burner serve its purpose and remove him off the surface
Gunshots let off! My instincts was to get him
Make sure I hit him, then break North, shonuff!
Holding down my fort, taking no shorts of no sorts
My four five turn to a blowtorch
It's still cocked! I tried to get away safe
Yo that shit was hot as hell I still stuck it in my waist
Dud my dirt, YEAH, did murk, YEAH, murder was the case
Then it hit heart beating like a nigga on base
I found a spot, chilled, parlayed for a second
Fixed my weapon, then headed back to my section
Now I'm back home smoking and drinking I'm bent now
I meditate on flashbacks of how it went down
It's kill or be killed, thats a true fact
There ain't no telling when these niggas are coming to bust open your back
It's ill, it's real, but still I feel
If provoked murder, nigga I'm born to kill

[Billy Danze]
Yo, it's the case of the state
Versus the great one seven one eight
Gun slinger from Brownsville
Where niggas were born to kill

[LaShonda]
Yo, some chick think she saw you jump up out the jeep
You said you was across the street laying with the heat

[Billy Danze]
What? That bitch lying
Here's a cocksucker I never heard of
I ain't doing time for no motherfucking murder
When Mr. Gonzalez was stretched in the mud
I was home with the dog dome taking down what's up
Therefore I'm innocent!

[LaShonda]
Mad shells were spit

[Billy Danze]
They ain't mine
I do damage with an Imp, they found shells from a nine
This shit is crazy
Would you please contact Lazy
Tell him I need an attorney
To ride with me on this motherfucking journey
Now, ten months later, after being indicted
Third off of fifteen are clickin' shit so fuck it I'mma fight it
Me and the Jewboy lay back after D.A. spoke
Cross examination, Bernstein jumped up and broke no joke
Stepped over the judge's crown
Stepped on the D.A.'s ground
Looked at the snitch with a frown
Went to the jury and got down
Seventy-two hours later, creeping on some playing the wall shit
Toting the same Glock Mr. Gonzalez got knocked off with
As I
