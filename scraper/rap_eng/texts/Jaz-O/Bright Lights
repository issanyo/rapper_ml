HOOK (Mic Handz)

Bright Lights / Big City
Game tight we get right/
Come rock wit' me/
Shine bright/ in the lights of my city
Every day every night/
Come fuck wit' me

VERSE 1 (Mic Handz)

From the tip of that empire state/
To the top of them new towers
Boy city great/ till it's late in them wee hours
Sun showers /keeping all streets wet
And a pocket / full of the paper
That'll eat most debts
Home of most east coast vets/ N.Y
All thorough/ never gave a fuck where we lay
We all borough
Conduit, Belt / Whitestone to the Tri-Boro
Sick as the Van Wyck/ around 6 as you cross boroughs
It's Handz
City spokesman/ controller elect
And I'm gon' give it up/ until people
Give niggas respect/ for real
Young Sinatra /hitting without the blue eyes
Stacked in the back of this rat pack/ telling true lies
It's Mr /oh Ah Oh Ah/ yeah he ill
Splitting the lane/ changing the game
Moving at will
Giving niggas the pill/ still they don't get no pass
They high and dry/
They loud/ but they don't get no ass
We in the clouds at last/ and we surfing on new levels
Every bar dat pass/ tilts a glass of that spade bevel
Deep as a grave shovel/ as we play on plots
And were doing it for the block/ as we lock down lots
In my city

VERSE 2 (Jaz-O)

From 644 Park Ave/
The student and the master of craft/
They still screaming/ its all on Jaz
From the rugged and the raunchy/
Cracks on the concrete/ blame me
It's my own asphalt
From shoe boxes to cash vaults/ me and my team
Supplied niggas with passports
Big city living
Spending like /everyday was Christmas and Thanksgiving
Glistening/
Summertime fringed
We ain't the pawns /we the dons /at cha' christening
Word on the street /and everybody's listening
Never married /but i keep wives drizzling/
Cause i mac (yep)/never microsoft
(com'on)
She going south/ I'm going North
Often/ they know the time /
Word to my cross wind
They call me Jaz/ i even ball in Utah/
Rhyme/ don't rap
Lines worth/ a mill sack
