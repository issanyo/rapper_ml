[Intro: Mike Jones]
I be rollin' in my whip
I be rollin' in my whip
I be fuckin' nigga's dip's
Am I wrong?
Got him in his feelings
Now he wanna trip
Now he wanna trip, man

[Hook: Mike Jones]
I be rollin' in my whip
I be fuckin' nigga's dip's
Got him in his feelings
Now he wanna trip
Blowin' up his phone
Lookin' for his bitch
Lookin' like a bitch
Now, ain't that a bitch?

[Verse 1: Mike Jones]
Blowin' up my phone, and he lookin' for his ho
She done came 'n' went, I don't see that ho no mo'
I'm out here on grind, everyday
Got no time for this ho, anyway
I fucked this ho, then I get her out my way
I'm out here grindin' everyday to stack this pay
My homeboy 'n' my advice, get out my face
'Cause if you do this wrong, you gon' meet this 'K
Got no time for that bullshit
Ride around in my coupe, nigga, full clip
I ride around with a full clip
Last time, boy, I ain't got no time for bullshit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I be rollin' in my
With the top gone
Now he wanna trip
'Cause his bitch gone
He be trickin' like a bitch
Now his guap gone
Now this nigga wanna trip
'Cause she never ever home
She don't pick up her phone
When we goin' strong
We be blowin' strong
All the time we alone
I hit that bitch with that bone
Now she trippin', he trippin'
Man, what's goin' on?
Gettin' money to the guap
Sunrise to the dome
Never stop, we be pimpin'
I grind with my niggas
All the time on the grind, man
I shine with my niggas
It's money over bitches
So you know just how we do
I be rollin' in my whip
Fuckin' bitches with the crew

[Hook]
