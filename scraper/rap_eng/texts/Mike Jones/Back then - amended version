[Chorus: x2]
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me, I said
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me, I said
Mike Jones!
Befo' I came up in the game these hoes didn't show no love
They see me in the club and used to treat me like a scrub
They wouldn't holla cause my dollars wasn't swoll enough
I bet they change they mind when them 80 4's come rolling up
They see that I'm a star, now they want to sit in my car
Now they want to count my cheese, smoke my weed and sip my bar now
They used to love to me diss me, now they rush to hug and kiss me now
They telling all they friends when I leave how they miss me now
Two, eight, one, three, three oh, eight zero zero fo'
Hit Mike Jones up on the low cause Mike Jones about to blow
Befo' the ice was in my grill, befo' I got my major deal
These hoes wouldn't give a damn if I was heah, geah
Befo' the ice was in my grill, befo' I got my major deal
These hoes wouldn't give a damn if I was heah, geah
Befo' the ice was in my grill, befo' I got my major deal
These hoes wouldn't give a damn if I was heah, geah, because

[Chorus: x2]
I remember back den, most of them hoes couldn't stand me
But now them same hoes begging me to pull down they panties
A couple of 'em said I was cute but I was just too chubby
Same size a year later the same hoes want to fuck me
Because they see me paid, pimping pens, working my jelly
And I ain't tripping cause my pockets stick out mo' than my belly
They know I'm paid, living laid in the shade
Two slabs in the Escalade with fo' or five estates
They know that I got it made, I'm a motherfucking baller
She would want a nigga now but I ain't got no time to call her
I'ma stall her like she stalled me, now she trying to call me
Bitch I'ma dog yo' hoe ass like you dogged me
I'm Mike Jones, don't act like you don't know the name
Ain't nothing changed but my change, I'ma stay the same
I'm Mike Jones, don't act like you don't know the name
Ain't nothing changed but my change, I'ma stay the same

[Chorus: x2]
[Mike Jones]
Befo' my paper came, befo' I got my fame
These hoes that's poppin on me now didn't even know my name
They said my flow was lame, they said I had no game
I told 'em all I was fin' to blow they thought I was insane
But they my name started blowing up quick, now they jumping on my dick
Cause they see me on the rise and know now my paper thick
But they my name started blowing up quick, now they jumping on my dick
Because they see me on the rise and oh now my paper thick

[Chorus: x2]
