[Verse 1]
I just dropped her off
I'm thinking "Oh what a night"
I ought to be flying but I'm sittin' here at this green light
I thought I was in control
Thought I knew where I wanted to go
She's got me turned inside out
I'm wonderin' what it's all about

[Chorus]
(Is she there in your dreams?) I don't know, I can't sleep
(Is she breaking your heart?) Yeah, but isn't it sweet?
(Does she know how you feel?) It's right on the tip of my tongue
(Are you walking on air?) Well I'm sure feeling tall
(Does she trouble your mind?) It's no trouble at all
Oh I don't know but something tells me it must be love

[Verse 2]
I just missed my turn
Guess I'm not thinking straight
Oh and what's with this car, it's driving me back to her place
I'm out here circling around
I've already covered this ground
These feelings just can't be denied
So what am I trying to decide

[Chorus]
(Is she there in your dreams?) I don't know, I can't sleep
(Is she breaking your heart?) Yeah, but isn't it sweet?
(Does she know how you feel?) It's right on the tip of my tongue
(Are you walking on air?) Well I'm sure feeling tall
(Does she trouble your mind?) It's no trouble at all
Oh I don't know but something tells me it must be love

[Chorus]
(Is she there in your dreams?) I don't know, I can't sleep
(Is she breaking your heart?) Yeah, but isn't it sweet?
(Does she know how you feel?) It's right on the tip of my tongue
(Are you walking on air?) Well I'm sure feeling tall
(Does she trouble your mind?) It's no trouble at all
Oh I don't know but something tells me it must be love

[Outro]
I don't know but something tells me
Oh I don't know but something tells me it must be love
I don't know but something tells me
Oh I don't know but something tells me it must be love
