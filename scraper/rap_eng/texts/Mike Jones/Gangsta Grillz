Ridin through like 'did you see those big wheels?'
Pop the trunk and let me feel, I got chills

Thats right, they know who is it
Run it
4 tires, 4's spinnin like a ceilin fan
Seats reclinin, smokin pine with the wheel in my hand
Diamonds shinin, gangsta grill look like a hundred grand
Now thats a Texas thang mayn, you wouldn't understand
We got that country grammer just like the St.Lunatics
In Texas (we screwed up!) Thats how we be doin it! (Thats right)
Cause round here, it ain't all about the canabope??
Cause boy sittin fat with tacs taller than the alamo?

(Chorus)
I see you with the candy paint
Do you got them dollas mayn?
Its all about the heavy weight
Let me hear ya holla ya mayn
Houston, you know wat it do
Let me holla mayn
LeToya just too much for you
Let me hear ya holla
