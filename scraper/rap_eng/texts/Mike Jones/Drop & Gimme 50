[Hook: Hurricane Chris & Mike Jones]
She bustin' it wide open, and shakin' it on the floor

I'm finna get on the flo' (Oh), I'm finna get on the flo' (Oh)

She wanna drop & gimme 50, drop & gimme 50
Drop & gimme 50, girl drop & gimme 50
Drop & gimme 50, drop & gimme 50
Drop & gimme 50, girl drop & gimme 50

[Mike Jones]
Lil' mama right there bad, she droppin' and shakin' fast
Come holla I got the dollars, got more if ya ass will swallow
She shakin it by the roba hopin' it by the Bentley
She know that I'm high and tipsy now drop it and gimme 50
She see me with Hurricane so dropp'n it and do her thang
She know when I get inside, I'mma fuck up her walls man
She see me with Collipark she see me with 3-feet
She know when it come to mind she know it ain't 3-feet
She bustin' it wide open, and shakin' it on the flo
She said if I get her tipsy we gon' leave and hit the mo'
I told her, "girl here you go", I teased her on the low
Now she freakin' me on the flo' she beggin' me for some mo'
I hit it and hit the do', I hit it just like a pro'
Ice age and 50, 150 we in the do'

[Hook]

[Mike Jones]
Now put yo right hand in the air
Put the left one in yo underwear
Now tickle dat cat, tickle dat cat
Now tickle dat cat, tickle dat cat
Ooooh, she act a fool on the dick, fool on the dick
She act a fool on the dick, fool on the dick
Now get sick with it and do the split with it
Now get sick with it and do the split with it
Say girl drop & gimme 50, drop & gimme 50
Drop & gimme 50, drop & gimme 50
Now I don't mean to start no riot
All the ugly women in the house be quiet

[Hook]

[Hurricane Chris]
Now by the 3rd verse It's way hotter, we wide open
She dropped it down low with her hips and her thighs rollin'
I noticed that can't nobody do it like I do it
I'm posted in V.I.P. with 2 chicks on the side of me
We got money so tell the other niggas to stop pullin' out they cash
And let me see how you act for a stack
Drop it low and brang it up like you a fool
Now put a dip in yo back and let me see what you can do
She say if she bend it over it'll be a full moon
I told her bend it over let me see that full moon
Like the boom boom room whole club on tune
Shake it like you tryna break it ain't no sense in even fakin'
You know me I do it big by the bar and tell em jig
As soon as we walk in the do', we go straight to the dance floor
Get it poppin'

[Hook] - 2X

[Outro]
This what you get when Collipark hook up with The Package Sto' nigga
Ya'll ain't know we was coming back like this, did ya?
