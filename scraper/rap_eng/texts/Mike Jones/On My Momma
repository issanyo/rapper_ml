[Hook]
I just took your bitch, and I ain't have to do shit (That's on my Momma)
Why you mad at me? She all on my dick
I rep Money Train. Money Train in the bitch
Everyday on the grind, 'cause we tryin' to get rich

[Intro]
Money Train
This shit too easy, man

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Mike Jones]
All I did was pull in my whip
Next thing you know, I was takin' your bitch
Pull up out the lot, drop top on a bitch
On everything, I got her on my dick
I just took your bitch, and I ain't have to do shit
Swangin' lane to lane in my brand new 6
All these hoes, they on my dick
What you do, Mike Jones? Drop the top on that bitch

[Hook]

I just took your bitch, and I ain't have to do shit (That's on my Momma)

[Verse 2: ]
Don't be mad at me 'cause I took your bitch
She was all aboard, and I ain't have to do shit
Money Train, we run this bitch
We drop the top when we lane switch
I don't love these hoes, I don't trust these hoes
I'ma hit it again, and 86 these hoes
These hoes ain't loyal, your ass should've knew that
You caught up in your feelings 'cause my click ran through that
You gave her love, I just gave her dick
That's why I took your bitch, and I ain't have to do shit
She came with you, but she left with me
She want a pimp, and I'm the recipe
You lame niggas can't fuck with me
That's why they follow my steps, tryin' to get like me
I'm a trendsetter, I set trends
Got her bent over, doin' back bends
We set it off, we ain't playin' games
And all my niggas 'bout the same thing
All aboard this money train
And your bitch'll do it, for the Money Train
You was hatin' on me, but she boppin' on me
Better get your bitch, and quit hatin', homie
Don't check me, nigga, check your bitch
'Cause I took your bitch, and I ain't have to do shit
