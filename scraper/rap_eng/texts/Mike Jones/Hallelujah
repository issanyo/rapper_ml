[Hook: Mike Jones]
I just got a call and was like "Hallelujah"
I just got a check and was like "Hallelujah"

[Verse 1: Mike Jones]
Mike Jones
I just got a check, I'm fitna go flex
Her body so wet, she want me for sex
I'm 'bout to blow up again, my friend
I said, I'm 'bout to blow up again, my friend
Thank God my real name known
Walk inside any bank I want and be like "Hallelujah"
I said, thank God my real name known
Walk inside any bank I want and be like "Hallelujah"

[Hook]

They feelin' Mike Jones, they feelin' my song
I'm back in my zone, I'm back in my zone
She see that I'm on, she wanna come home
But, I'm stackin' this paper and never at home

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yung Deuce]
I go to the mall and fill up them bags
One day I'm in Benz, next day I'm in Jag
He blessin' me, huh? I ain't doin' too bad
I'm gettin' it, huh? It's comin' in fast
I still got my health, I still got my wealth
When 'Money Train' drop, it's gonna move off the shelf
I went through some things on this road to riches
He opened my eyes and painted them pictures
I'm feeling so good, and grippin' on wood
I'm bending them corners, I'm up in your 'hood
I'm blowin' up quick like I knew that I would
I'm blowing up quick like I knew that I would

[Hook]
