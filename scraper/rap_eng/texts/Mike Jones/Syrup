[Intro]
Mike Jones
Grippin' grain with the top back
Who? Mike Jones
No, they can't stop that
I be sippin' on that syrup, I be sippin' drank
I be switchin' lanes, grippin' grain in the turnin' lane

[Hook]
I be sippin' syrup, I be sippin' drank
I be switchin' lanes, drippin' candy paint

[Verse 1]
Grippin' grain with the top back
Who? Mike Jones
No, they can't stop that
I be sippin' on that syrup, I be sippin' drank
I be switchin' lanes, grippin' grain in the turnin' lane
Got your dame, and she on me 'cause she want me now
See me pullin' up 24's, she on me now
Back then, back when
I used to hit the block, drop the top, and still stack Benjamin's
I be sippin' syrup, I be sippin' drank
Car automatic, my car, it don't even crank
All I do is call her, she gon' come over
Maybach's, we don't drive, we gon' call a chauffeur
I be stackin' change on a Money Train
Mike Jones, represent the Money Train
I be sippin' syrup, I be sippin' drank

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Lovin' the way that I swag
Lovin' the way that I style
Checkin' me out
I'm rockin' this Rollie
They callin' me Goldie
I'm one of the dopest
You niggas don't know me
I'm ballin' like Kobe
Now, maybe I'm 'bron
Now, maybe I'm [?]
You niggas done talkin' all reckless
Homie, this cash, you better respect it
Tippin' on 4's, wrapped in the Vogues
Poppin' my trunk, and I'm lettin' 'em know
Killin' the flow
I'm doper than niggas who on
My candy is drippin' on chrome
Your bitch in my home
She lovin' the way I be shinin' and grindin' when I'm in my zone
Leave me alone
Bad to the bone
You niggas all dated, and my niggas on
Nigga, this Texas
Cadillac, Buick, or a Lexus
Swangin' up the whole intersection
One time for my niggas who be restin'
For my nigga Bun B, and my nigga Pimp C
Let me see you make a bitch go to work
And if she fitna take it off in that ass in the South
Let a real nigga hit it up first
I am the man, and I'm lovin' my planet
I'm makin' a grand off the shit that I do
City of purple, never commercial
Two cups for my nigga DJ Screw
I am the man, and I'm lovin' my planet
I'm makin' a grand off the shit that I do
City of purple, never commercial
Two cups for my nigga DJ Screw
Hold up

[Hook]
