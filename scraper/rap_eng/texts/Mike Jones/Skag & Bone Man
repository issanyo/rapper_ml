On and on
Like you even know what's going on
Into this world that I'm drawn
They'll kill you before you're born
They'll pawn your soul to be number one
You say it's the old fashioned same old song
That's how your mother likes it all night long

And if
She says how to feel
Don't even talk about it

We could stay at home man
Call the skag and bone man
Dig our grave out with a spoon
Then in the morning picking flowers
Stare at the wall for hours
Til the sun becomes the moon
You say it's old fashioned, well one thing I know
That's how your mother likes it, now watch my boy go

Yes it's real
Like your next meal
Dont even talk about it
