[Intro: Mike Jones & Trey Songz]
I lost my house, lost my car
But it's one thing I know I ain't lost, baby
That's you, I know that
I know, I know, oh
I know Mike Jones, baby girl
I know, if I wasn't a superstar
Rollin' in fancy cars, you'd still be with ya boy
I know, you'd still be with Songz baby
I know, and that boy Mike Jones, baby girl
I know, if I wasn't a superstar
Rollin' in fancy cars, you'd still be with ya boy

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I know with you I'll never be alone
I know that you would never do me wrong
I know if I wasn't a superstar
Rollin' in fancy cars, you'd still be with ya boy
I know with you I'll never be alone
I know that you would never do me wrong
I know if I wasn't a superstar
Rollin' in fancy cars, you'd still be with ya boy

[Verse 1: Mike Jones & Trey Songz]
You ain't gotta tell me twice, I already know
You was here when fame came and gon' be here, when fame go
And I know you know that I'll take you around the world
And I know that you ain't trippin' on them other girls
I know before my deal and my grill baby
I know you kept it real, kept it trill baby
I know if I lose everythin'
Money cars and fame, my baby girl won't change, I said
I know through the thick and the thin baby
I know, more than a lover she my friend baby
I know if I lose my house
She gon' be right there with me sleepin' out on the couch, I said
I know if I lose my house
She gon' be right there with me sleepin' out on the couch, I said
I know
You gon' be right there with me sleepin' out on the couch girl, I know

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I know with you I'll never be alone
I know that you would never do me wrong
I know if I wasn't a superstar
Rollin' in fancy cars, you'd still be with ya boy
I know with you I'll never be alone
I know that you would never do me wrong
I know if I wasn't a superstar
Rollin' in fancy cars, you'd still be with ya boy

[Verse 1: Mike Jones]
She ain't trippin 'bout money, she ain't trippin 'bout cars
'Cause if I lose everythin' she here with ya boy
A down-ass chick, don't care about the shine
She'll pass it all up just to spend some time
Love to wine and dine, she all over me
Every time she know I'll leave, she get close to me
My girl don't care about no money or no foreign whips
She'd rather stay at home forget takin' them long trips
I'm with her every night, I hug her squeeze her tight
I was blind at one time but now I see the light
I'm with her every night, I hug her squeeze her tight
I was blind at one time but now I see the light
Call her my baby girl, somethin' like my tenderoni
Before the fame came, my girl was all on me
Call her my baby girl, somethin' like my tenderoni
'Cause she was here when I was lonely

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I know with you I'll never be alone
I know that you would never do me wrong
I know if I wasn't a superstar
Rollin' in fancy cars, you'd still be with ya boy
I know with you I'll never be alone
I know that you would never do me wrong
I know if I wasn't a superstar
Rollin' in fancy cars, you'd still be with ya boy

[Outro: Trey Songz]
Ya boy, ya boy, ya boy
You'd still be with ya boy
Songz
You'd still be with me baby, yeah
