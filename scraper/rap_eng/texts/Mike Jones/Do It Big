Mike Jones Who?
Mike Jones Who?
Mike Jones

I charge 5 for a flow (do it big nigga)
I charge 7 for a show (do it big nigga)
I'm major without a major deal (do it big nigga)
Fifteen Thousand in my grill

[Chorus]
I smoke (Yea!), I drank (Yea!)
I supposed to stop but I can't (I can't!)
I'ma dog (Yea!), I love hoes (Yea!)
And I'm addicted to money, cars and clothes (WEELLL)
Do it big then (yah! Yah!)
Do it big nigga (yah! yah!)
Do it big nigga (yah! yah!)
Do it big nigga (yah! yah!)

[Verse 1]
I smoke, I blow, I sip, I drank
I'm the leader of the team
I'm the captain of the team
I'ma grinder not a whiner
I'ma hustler not a struggler
I'm the king of these streets mother fucker (Mike Jones)
So while your out there hatin', talkin down on my name
I'm still runnin' these streets, I'm still runnin' the rap game
And nothing change but my show and my flow
I'm gettin 7 for my shows and I'm gettin 5 for my flow
And you still doing promos (?) clubs doin' shows
Cuz you know and I know promotoers ain't pickin you for shows
You a hoe not just to me but everybody in these streets
Instead of coming to me you drop a CD screaming beat
That lemme know that your weak and that you can't fuck with us
How you gon be gangsta working at Babys-R-Us?
How you gon bang ghetto status with ghettos you ain't even lived in
You claimin your gangsta but that ain't how gangstas living (cheah)

[Chorus]
I smoke (Yea!), I drank (Yea!)
I supposed to stop but I can't (I can't!)
I'ma dog (Yea!), I love hoes (Yea!)
And I'm addicted to money, cars and clothes (WEELLL)
Do it big then (yah! Yah!)
Do it big nigga (yah! yah!)
Do it big nigga (yah! yah!)
Do it big nigga (yah! yah!)
