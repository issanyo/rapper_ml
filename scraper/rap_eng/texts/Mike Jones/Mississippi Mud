For all my grandma dreams
Iâ€™m putting my price on everything
Tapping at the calculator
Tax on everything
INT on everything
Grandma loved her birds since Maxwell
I make pretty every wing
No more ugly duckling
I went darkwing on the ducks
Auntie went from bird to cluck
Doc went from All American
Now how that turn to dust
Miracles can work reverse
Your gifts require gifts
I know the flow is stoic
But the myth gon need a myth
They making profits off our spirit
Its been tragic ever since
And when I tap into that magic
Know we had to had it then
Yes you fucking right I'm mad
Cuz I rock that type of skin
And this embedded in my DNA
Had to become the CNA
To heal
My sharecropping grandfather coulda been a doctor
Without the trauma, bet my father coulda been an author
We pose in all the headshots, now we need a Malala
Money in the air, pullin and yank us out the auction

Chorus:
Mississippi Mud
Was soaked in black blood
How many more must die

They made sandwiches for the lynchings now they grandsons in the mentions
They invented niggers and we live with they descendants
We owed our reparations, put a hold to older systems
Yall gon have to haul it over
Man Unlock all them prisons

Chorus:
Mississippi Mud
Was soaked in black blood
How many more must die

Emmit was murdered down in Money, Mississippi
Mama took a bus down mullin over the mystery
One more black boy needed by history
Blood grew the rose in concrete, we are the chemistry
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, that said Im able, i can(e)
All to shake the snake, black folks hopped on the train
Coming to the north with suitcases of pain

My heart is singing a sad song
Cause so many brothers are gone
Its happened many times before
Lord, lord how many more

Went down to the river Jordan
Where John baptised three
When I walked the devil in hell
Said "John ain't baptized me"
I said roll, Jordan, roll
Roll, Jordan, roll
My soul ought to rise in heaven, Lord
For the year when Jordan rolls
