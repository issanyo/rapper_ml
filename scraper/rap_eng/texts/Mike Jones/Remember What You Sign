(DJ Blazin) Intro: (0:00:04 - 0:00:16)
In this day and age; you always gotta remember
To read the contract before you sign it
And always "remember what you sign"

(Atm) Verse 1: (0:00:18 - 0:01:16)
You gotta read the contract, before you sign it
You gotta read the piece of paper
Before you sign it
You gotta read read the paper, before you sign it
Because if you don't read it
Then you will get tricked
You will get trapped in "The Devil's Trap"
You will get trapped in his trap
By the piece of paper, by the contract
When you negotiate with him
When you negotiate with "The Devil"
He will trap you
You gotta remember what you sign
Remember what you sign
When you sign the piece of paper
People will remember you, by name association
By your cell phone number, by your email address
By your home mail address
People will remember you for life
Because you signed the contract
People will remember you for life
Because you signed the piece of paper
People will remember you for life
Because of your your name
And people will remember you
Because you signed the contract

(Atm) Chorus: (0:01:16 - 0:01:45) [DJ Blazin]
Now there will be alot of times
[Where you gotta walk away]
There will be alot of times
[Where you gotta runaway]
There will be alot of times
[Where you gotta make decisions]
And there will be alot of times
[When you gotta let it out]

You must be ready for a fight
You must be ready for a slap
You must be ready for a battle
You must be ready for a war

But through it all stand up
Speak out and be the man
But don't forget to live your life
And remember what you sign

(Atm) Verse 2: (0:01:46 - 0:02:44)
When you sign the contract, people will remember you
They remember you on social media
Because your a star; because your a legend, because your a veteran
Because your a hall of famer
People will remember you
By your sins and by your pleasures
People will remember you
For the things that you've done
People will remember you
Because of the things that you use to do
People will remember you
For the things you wanted to do
In life, but thanks to God, he changed your life
He give you a chance to live your life
A different chance or 2nd chance
Give a chance to be livin in life (24/7)
God gives you a chance to make things right
But sometimes thanks to sins and pleasures
We don't change our life
We don't wanna change our life
Because we enjoy the pleasures
Of sin and the pleasures of life
And want to impress people
But thanks to God, thanks to Jesus
And thanks to the Holy Ghost
You get the chance to sign the piece of paper
And the contract

(Atm) Chorus: (0:02:44 - 0:03:44) [DJ Blazin] (Twice)
Now there will be alot of times
[Where you gotta walk away]
There will be alot of times
[Where you gotta runaway]
There will be alot of times
[Where you gotta make decisions]
And there will be alot of times
[When you gotta let it out]

You must be ready for a fight
You must be ready for a slap
You must be ready for a battle
You must be ready for a war

But through it all stand up
Speak out and be the man
But don't forget to live your life
And remember what you sign

(Poncho) Ending: (0:03:44 - 0:03:52)
Praise the Lord everybody, Hallelujah
Thank you Jesus amen
I thank God for the Holy Ghost
