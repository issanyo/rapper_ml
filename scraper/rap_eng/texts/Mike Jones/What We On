[Intro]
Yeah, we on
Money Train

[Hook: Mike Jones]
You ain't seen what we seen
Everyday, we grind for this green
Got money, hoes, rock fancy clothes
We all livin' a dream

[Verse 1: Yung Deuce]
You don't do what we do
You ain't 'bout the life, my crew
It's that Yung Deuce 'n' who? (Mike Jones)
Nigga said, Yung Deuce 'n' who? (Mike Jones)
We ride around in them whips
All we do is take them trips
In and out of lanes, nigga, we dip
All these bad bitches, we flip
Nigga like me, still on top
Bad yellow hoes still gon' bop
Like them things [?] my drop
And them blades, nigga, they chop
When I'm in the studio, I flow
Matter of fact, hoes know that I go
Purple, that drank what we gon' pour
Purple, that dank what we gon' blow
Nigga, we on [?] my city
All these hoes tryin' fuck with it
Me 'n' my Money Train committed
All my niggas know that we did it
Nigga, we did it, we did it
But you ain't done what we did
Nigga, we did it, we did it
But you ain't done what we did
Nigga, we did it, no kidding
But you ain't done what we did
You don't get hot like we did
Nigga, ain't fly like we is
Nigga, we did it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mike Jones]
You don't grind like we grind
You don't shine like we shine
We stack dollar signs while y'all wastin' time
'Cause that money stay on our mind
Money Train on my brain
That's why I'm all aboard on this train
She see us switchin' lanes, see us grippin' grain
She just wanna come through and hang
She see Deuce flippin' big ends
She see me stackin' big Ben's
She see Strongarm on every track
She call that a "win-win"
She see us swangin' through lane to lane
We grippin' grain, reppin' the Money Train
Lil' Momma, she see the cash
On everything, she wanna hang
She want to come through and floss
She see three G's, we boss
She see all of us with black cars
She know we don't take no loss
She know when she with us, she straight
Every day feel like her birthday
She just left you for the Money Train
'Cause the Money Train on that cake

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Nigga like me, still gon' rip
When I'm in the booth, nigga, I flip
I ain't even trippin', boy, don't trip
Nigga like me never gon' slip
When I hit the strip club, I won't tip
'Cause I just got me a new dip
Matter of fact, just got a new whip
Matter of fact, tracks [?]
Nigga, ridin' around [?] my city [?]
Hoes know that I'm on... purple, drank
Only thing in like to sip on
Matter of fact, purple dank, I blow on
Told these niggas [?]
Matter of fact, [?]
Doin' up [?]
Matter of fact, yeah, nigga, just check it
All the hoes get naked
If they hatin', they better respect it
'Cause my niggas straight, we gon' check it
Money Train, nigga, that's my team
Yeah, that's my team
And, all we do is get green
Livin' this life, just like a dream
All we do is get green
The Money Train is my team
Livin' this life, just like a dream
Bitch, I'm a money makin' machine
All I do is stack up them stacks
Bring 'em in like racks
Matter of fact, go on 'n' bring the bitch back
Then put the bitch straight on that track
Nigga, we get it
