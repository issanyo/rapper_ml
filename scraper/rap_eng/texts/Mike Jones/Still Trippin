Still trippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Trippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Trippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Pimpin' four hoes and I'm packing four fours
Still trippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Trippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Trippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Pimpin' four hoes and I'm packing four fours
Now look who creepin', look who crawlin' still ballin' in the mist
It's that 6" 6' long dick Slim nigga stickin' your chick
Pullin' tricks lookin' slick at all times when I'm flippin'
Bar sippin' car dipping grand wood grain grippin'
Still trippin' on four fours wrapped in four vogues
Pimpin' four hoes and I'm packin' four fours
Blowin' on that indo game cube, Nintendo
Five percent tint, so you can't see up in my window
These niggas don't understand me 'cuz I'm boss hogg on candy
Top down at Maxi's wit a big Glock 9 handy
Pieced up creased up staying dressed to impress
Big boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness
Oh, Gucci shades up on my brades when I escalade
When I'm riding sprewells sliding like a escapade
I got it made, the big boss of the north
Ain't shit changed I still represent swisha house

Four fours I'm trippin' wood grain I'm grippin'
Catch me lane switching with the paint drippin'
Turn your neck and your dame missing
Me and Slim we ain't tripping I'm finger flipping and syrup sippin'
Like do or die I'm pour pimpin' car stop, rims keep spinnin'
I'm flipping drop with invisible tops hoes bop when my drop step out
I'm shaking the block with four eighteens
Candy green with eleven screens my gasoline always supreme
Got do-do the brown with a pint of lean it takes grinding to be a king
It takes grinding to be a king first round draft picks coming
'Who is Mike Jones', coming slab shining with the grill and woman
Slab shining with the grill and woman
I'm Mike Jones, Mike Jones the one and only you can't clone me
(Who)
Got a lot a haters and a lot of homies, some friends and some phony
Back then hoes didn't want me now, I'm hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn't want me now, I'm hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn't want me now, I'm hot hoes all on me
(I said)

What it do it's Paul wall I'm the people's champ
My chain light up like a lamp 'cuz now I'm back with the camp
I'm crawling similar to a ant 'cuz I'm low to the earth
People's feelings get hurt when they figure out what I'm worth
I got eighty Fo's poking out at the club I'm showing out
I'm a player ain't no doubt hoes want to know what I'm bout
Biggest diamonds off in my mouth princess cuts all in my chain
Wood grain all in my range dripping stains when I switch lanes
Switched the name it's still the same swisha house or swisha blast
Mike Jones he running the game and magnificent 'bout his cash
Michael watts he made me hot hard work took me to the top
G. Dash took me to the lot he wrote a check and bought a drop
I got the Internet goin' nuts
But T. Farris got my back so now I'm holdin' my nuts
It's Paul wall baby what you know bout me
I'm only five nine southle baby holla at me
