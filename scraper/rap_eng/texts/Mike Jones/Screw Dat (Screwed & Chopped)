[Deep voice]
We gon' screw dat

[Chorus 2X: Mike Jones]
Bring your music down to H-Town (we gon' screw dat)
You better tell ya girl cause this shit come around (we gon' screw dat)
You see some 80 4's creepin through ya town (we gon' screw dat)
We started the purple stuff down in H-Town (we gon' screw dat)

[Mike Jones]
I'm from the city of the codeine, candy paint with fallin screens
Diamonds in my grill and ear, you know I live a baller's dream
My music gotta be (screwed up) I came in the game and moved up
A lot of people hate the fact that Mike Jones blew up
I got diamonds shinin on my cross, candy blind me from the gloss
I keep my hand on nina ross for haters who wanna break me off
80 4's underneath my ride, 45 keep it by my side
M.O.B. until I die, females fall when I pass by

[Chorus]
[Mike Jones]
You know me; hundred dollar bills on my fold up, 80 4's every time I roll up
Purple drink everytime I po' up, purple drink everytime I po' up
Doe-doe that's all I blow up, got in the game and I had to show up
Piece and chain, diamond Range, when you see it it'll make you throw up
Down South we flip the bills hold wood wheel and show icy grills
I'm still runnin the underground, even though I got a major deal
Down South we flip the bills hold wood wheel and show icy grills
I'm still runnin the underground, even though I got a major deal

[Chorus]
[Mike Jones]
So - we be jammin our music slow, candy drippin up off the do'
Diamonds shinin, pimp reclinin - I'm actin bad on all you hoes
2 8 1, 3 3 oh, eight zero zero fo'
Hit Mike Jones up on the low cause Mike Jones about to blow
Swishahouse, Swisha Blast, we on the grind, for the cash
Y'all movin slow, we movin fast, y'all movin slow, we movin fast
I'm stackin dough, pimpin hoes, grippin grain sippin on fo-fo's
I stay on the grind 'til the day I go, I stay on the grind 'til the day I go

[Chorus]
