[Hook]
She like how I flex on her
She like how I sex on her
She like how I flex
She like how I flex
She want me for sex
She see that I'm on
She see we on chrome
And, stacking them cheques
She like how I flex on her
She like how I sex on her

[Verse 1]
I'm poppin' the Don
I'm poppin' the Moet
Please, bring me some mo'
I'm poppin' the bottle
I'm poppin' the model
The life that I chose
I got [?] lady
She walk in Giseppie
You see up eat 'fetti
She like how I flex on her
She like how I sex on her
When it's me 'n' her
We gonna do it right, by the fireplace
With the candle lights
I wine 'n' dine, then break it down
One thing she know, I'ma break her down
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
[?]
Wax on, wax off
I'm gettin' her done
While I'm all in her pants
She backin' me up
I'm takin' the charge
She all in my pants
Ooh, I can't think
While sippin' the paint
I'm fitna get active, so proactive
'Cause this is a crime
The way she flip and split, gymnastics
Concentrate like a math test
It's addin' up
[?] on the bumper, now back it up
OK, not far, 'cause that's enough
You got me
It's all gravy plus salisbury
Versace the [?]
Look good on your body
[?] your body [?] in your hand
Make me ask "Where's your ring finger?"
On the cool, I'm trippin'
City skippin', you bein' bad
Now, come get this whippin'
We still tippin'
Make it rain on glassy 4's
[?] clothes, peep my partition
Chauffeur off to nobody knows
She like how I flex, don't it?
HD my game, Sony
All in my lane, on it
Follow the train, get money

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Legs wrapped around my wait
Lift her up to my face
She want the K to take a taste
So I bow, and say my grace
Always do that 'fore I eat
Sex game crazy, head a beast
Goin' in, I'm goin' fleet
Skeet skeet, wet sheets
She like how I flex on her
She like how I sex on her
No K gonna wreck on her
I put her to sleep, coma
Back then, she didn't want it
Then I shot that game to her
Now I'm hot, she all on me
Then, I put that thing to her
Word to cool, we in a room
With black bottles and OG
I'm on one, she on two
She goin' in, on me
Got me harder, and harder
It makes me go harder
She wetter than water
I call her Ms. Ozarka
I put that nigga on the bench
And made me her starter
She like how I flex
She want me for sex
And made me her starter
K

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
She like how I'm flexin'
Like JJ, I'm in Houston, Texas
Got models with bottles with sparkles
Damn, we done lit up the section
Finessin' finessin'
Finessin' finessin' finessin' finessin'
Lil' momma so holy
Her daddy's a preacher
Her head is a blessing
Party on my Tempurpedic
Like MJ, I beat it
Aquafina smell like water
Fucked up, I eat it
Quarter mil on my neck
I done went got me a cheque
I thank God for life
'Cause every mornin' I flex
Pulled up in that 'vette
These hoes tryin' to fuck my car
Coffee cup full of bar
[?] a star
And a 3.5 in my Swisher got her mind blown
I got my muscle right
They try and keep up with the Jones

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
She don't fuck with no lames, no sir
I keep a lil' change on her
She ain't move around
She know where it's at
Flexin' when I'm wearin' no [?]
My type of [?]
If she would, I lumberjack then blow a rack
It ain't trickin' if you got it
[?] all over her body
She my trophy, not my wifey
She my rider, what a sight to see
In love with her, I better not be
Break bread for the ducks to eat
She just want to live in luxury
I just like when she come stunt with me
Fuck me, lust for me, trust in me
Thug with me, [?] with me, come with me
Do dumb with me, go crazy fun with me
[?] got them bands up
Like a drum major with his hands up
In the cut, like Neosporin
She fornicate quite [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 6]
We ain't losin', not today
Watch the movement, Money Train
Mike Jones, Yung Deuce
All together, that's Ice Age
Cold as fuck, but we still flexin'
Got a' old chick who's still textin'
But I let her go, never love a ho
You the type of girl to be left alone
I just want money to bring up my stamina
Workin' too hard, now I feel like an animal
Lookin' too fine, Nicki Minaj
Keep my shades on, Louis Vuitton
One in the house, one in the car
Just in case I wanna change up tomorrow
Keep three around, so you know I'm on bar
Plug in a [?] 'till my battery charged
Like, what's that?
A milli' on my mind, I'ma touch that
I came up in the game just to push my name
I don't want no fame, nigga, fuck that
Read you like an essay
Put you in your test zone
She say she like me better
When I'm on my flex mode

[Hook]

[Verse 7]
She like how I flex
She like how I flex
She like how I flex
She say that the dick is so good
This dick is so good
She just want me for sex
She say that she love to hang out with the Money Train
'Cause we stay runnin' through cheques
Then she went down on me, I can't even lie
On lil' momma, she do it the best
Who you know get it wetter than a lake?
Turn it around, and smack smack
Like I'm playin' spades
Flexin' with the Money Train
General, who you know
Sold 2.5 million out the gate
Not many
That's why we flex like every single day
That Money Train up on them tracks
I suggest you get out the way
Unless you're Hancock
I gave her what she want
Then she rolled up my dope
It ain't even been twenty minutes
And she already wantin' more
She smellin' good, like Body Works
So, I sexed her good and made her body work
Then, I poured up and twisted three grams
And, she said "What's in your 'gar?"
I said "[?] purp"
She like how I flex on her
She like how I sex on her
Her friend said she want next
So you know what I did next, don't you?
