Pour up
Money Train

[Hook]
I feel like we just won the chapionship
(Champagne music)
I play this when I celebrate
(Champagne music)
Don P pourin' out the bottle
(This that champagne music)

[Verse 1]
Bottles comin' to my table
With the sparkles on it
Money all on my table
Now, the bitches on it
We just got a fat check
So we ain't trippin' on it
I told 'em, "Bring some more bottles"
The models see, they wanna follow
Ace of Spades pourin' out the bottle
I'm sippin' Don Perignon
Gave up Moet, and now she's super sprung
I said, I'm sippin' Don Perignon
Gave up Moet, and now she's super sprung

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Don P pourin' out the bottle
Smash the gas when I hit the throttle
Got a bad bitch, like a supermodel
24/7, I'm stackin' dollars
Money Train is my campagne
Pourin' up that champagne
Gettin' dollars, stackin' dollars
Flippin' dollars on the Money Train
Every day is like a celebration
(Champagne music)
Hard work with some dedication
(This that champagne music)
All my niggas pour up your bottles
(Champagne music)

[Hook]
