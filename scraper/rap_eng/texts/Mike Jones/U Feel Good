Mike Jones
You need a dick? That feel like a prisoner out on parole
When it's hard on swoll its 24K gold
I'm Mike Jones (Who?) Mike Jones, Jones
That'll beat you back up whenever you act up
I'm lookin for a sex pet to break me off
And work on this hard dick until my shit get soft
I need a girl that think she bad, love to talk trash
But whine when I'm fuckin her fast
I never claim the pussy mine cause it ain't mine to claim
But for some reason when I'm in it, they be screamin my name
See your pussy, I'll please that
Believe me, I'll please that
Them orgasms that you need, you'll recieve that
Fuckin with Mike Jones, just pick up your home phone
I'll fuck you so good that you can't even walk, can't even talk
Mike Jones, just call and I'll come over
Dickin ya down, holdin ya back, grippin ya shoulders, it's over

I know you feel good the way I'm diggin you out
Run my fingers through your hair and put my dick in ya mouth
I'm the reason why you thickinin out
Niggas still can't believe I fuck, Still tryin to figure it out
Magno is still the baby faced thug that you love
Plus since you ain't my gal, we don't cuddle and hug
All I'm tryin to do is fuck up ya glove, ??? scuffin em up
Bust a nut or two, then I'm snug as a bug
Magno brings heat to the deck, seek with a tech
I'll dig so deep that it'll reach to your neck
Rough when I'm able, so I bring much to the table
All I need is ten strokes, then Ima bust on ya navel
Can't wait till the lights go off, I stay hard
My name ain't Bill Gates, I'm never Microsoft
I gots paper, floss Jags, floss Gators
And girls I chop up like Watts with a cross fader

[Hook]

[Mike Jones]
I say what I mean and I mean what I say
When it comes to fuckin hoes, Mike Jones don't play
See I dick a ho down from mornin, noon, to night
And when I don't give it to her, she be ready to fight
Cause I am Mike Jones (Who?) Mike Jones
That'll dick a ho down and make her moan and groan
I know you feel good don't ya? Real good don't ya?
This dick of mine, you just for you don't ya?

[Magnificent]
She can be a freak, but I'm a after broad
If I can still slide through like a Master card
Put ya ankles behind ya neck, the spine I wreck
We fuck at ya job, behind ya desk
Face down with ya ass up
I ain't tryin to go naked head, so I'm buyin rubbers with my last buck
Magnificent be cuttin
You feel good don't ya? They don't call me Magnificent for nothin
