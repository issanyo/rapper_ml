[Hook]
“Back then you didn’t want me, now I’m hot you all on me”
“Back then you didn’t want me, now I’m hot you all on me”
“Hold on you’re too fast you got me where you want me
Now I glowed up and you all on my body”

“Back then you didn’t want me, now I’m hot you all on me”
“Back then you didn’t want me, now I’m hot you all on me”
“Reminiscing them days when I was wrapped up on you now I’m getting money boy you better back up off me”

[Verse 1]
I’m a fly ass bitch with a nice ass whip and I
Get this paper yeah
And my mouth real slick ‘cause I give it to you straight I don’t need no chaser
I will not change who I am, so boy you need to understand
See I was always hot nigga but you was too dumb to see that I had potential in me
You was too busy chasin’ those fast bitches, yeah you know them ones with the fat ass bitches
But I clean up nice and now you want to be on me
See I can upgrade ya, I rather do this by my lonely
All the shooting in the gym, wasn’t with me for the win
Now, you can get in line with these other men

[Outro]
Back up off me, back up off me, back up off me, back up off me
You didn’t want me, didn’t want me

Back then you didn’t want me now I’m hot you all on me
Back then you didn’t want me now I’m hot you all on me
Back then, back then
Back then you didn’t want me now I’m hot you all on me
