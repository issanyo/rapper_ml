[Intro: Mike Jones]
Mike Jones! For the ladies baby

(beat drops)

Who?! Mike Jones (3x)

Shyeah!

This here for the ladies man
You know what I'm sayin
I know I ain't ballin' right now
But, if you stay down with me while I'm down
When I come up, I'm a prove it to you (Brighteyes: prove what?)
That I'm the type of nigga you need

[Chorus: Brighteyes & Mike Jones]
Not a baller, just dreamin' of being one
If you with me while I'm broke, when I'm rich it would be more fun
And, we can cruise I'll show you the whole world
C'mon, be a grown lady, instead of a little girl
Cause, I'm all you neeeed (Mike Jones: I'm all you need)
I think I'm, all that you neeeed girl

[Verse 1: Mike Jones]
Baby girl I know you tired of that mess, your man giving you stress
Put that cigarette down, let me put ya nerves to rest
See I'm a man not a child, with things that make you smile
You was here when I was broke, so I know you here for a while
She encouraged me to keep working hard for my dream
Even though my lights was out she stayed on my team
She helped me stay focused to get what I need
And I told her when I blow the whole world she gon see
She gon be the only one you see meee with
I'm for real this girl here legit
See I ain't got a lot of dollars but she love the dick
Quality time, me and her she love to get
See I'm a be there for her like she was there for me
I looked at her and told her "Mike Jones the type of nigga you neeeed"
I looked at her and told her "Mike Jones the type of nigga you need"

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Brighteyes]
I'm feelin' that I'm feelin' and a tone in your voice
I know what you wantin' baby, you uh, made the right choice
Cause the sex is great, and your lovin's appealin'
I feel I'm way more qualified, than them busters you been dealin' with
Come get a hit of this, mama come on and roll with me
And don't worry about drama yes I keep that fo' with me
Pretty much I'm down for a one night stand
That caddy drivin' man with grams all up in his hands
C'mon and roll with a G, c'mon and smoke with a G
And I know, your daddy and momma don't even approve of me
But still, the girl show me love cause she real
The type of chick that's down with you, with or without your deal
And there ain't no future bigger than the one that I'm planning for us
You got me twisted inside I'm bout to bust baby
I think I'm bout to bust, cause I, cause I, cause I told you that I'm all you need

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mike Jones]
Before the fame and change came, she was holdin' me down
When I needed me a ride, she would roll me around
She kept the sun shinin', when the rain came around
And from then on I went on and told her "for being down
I'm a forever be around" with her
Cause I ain't puttin' all this time just to leave her
She needs me and I know that I need her, yeah!
Mike Jones, Who?! Mike Jones, Jones
And I'm the type of nigga you need

[Chorus w/ Brighteyes by himself] (2x)
