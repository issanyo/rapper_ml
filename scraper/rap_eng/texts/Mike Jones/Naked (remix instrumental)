Don't say a word, just come over here
I got somethin i gotta do tonight: listen

(Verse 1)
Ain't never been a man wanting anything
As much as i want you
The sun dont come up till morning so tonight there's no excuse (mmm)
Just like the rain outside I'll make your love come down
So baby now its time, just can't wait no more, im gon' give you what ur body's been cryin for....
And if u tell me yes ill lay you down
Girl we ain't gotta rush just play around
We'll do it like we never done before
So go and lock that door, baby dont worry cuz ill be gentle

(Chorus)
Come on, baby turn the lights off let's get naked (Ooh come on)
Come on, baby girl you know i just can't take it (I can't take it no more)
Let your panties hit the floor, let your body steal the show right now
It seems like you're ready
So come on, girl i just can't wait to see us naked (us naked)
But naked

(Verse 3)
I know you want this girl, I can see it in your eyes
Don't be ashamed of what you got between those thighs, oh
You know I'm gon try not to be so excited, (but i can't help it)
Feels so good to be invited
So baby get ready cuz here i go-o..hey

(Verse 4)
Take off your shoes, i wanna see your toes
Slip off that skirt, and that shirt's gotta go
Come out them drawers, girl you won't be needin those
Now you're wearing what i like, baby let's go
Come on..

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
There's something bout that sexy skin your in
Your clothes dont do you justice, so come out of them
So baby take it off, so i can break you off
And give you love, love, love
Now its time to enjoy yourself
If you need assistance, baby girl im here to help
Cuz it's time for us to start this love makin
But first we gotta get butt naked

Damn girl (hey) you look so good
Won't you come over here (over here)
Slip off that skirt, you know that shirt gotta come off (baby baby baby)
Youre lookin kinda right, now you know it's time
Let's get naked
If you tell me yes, I'll lay you down (oh oh, oh yea)
Do it like we never done before (oh oh oh yea)
If you tell me yes, I'll lay you down...
