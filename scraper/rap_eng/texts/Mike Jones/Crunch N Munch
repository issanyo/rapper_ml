First I'm a get high, high, high
Then eat on Crunch 'n Munch, then eat on Crunch 'n Munch (4x)

[Verse 1:]
First I'm a get high, then eat on Crunch 'n Munch
I'm leanin' when I'm walkin' cause I been sippin' punch
When it come to weed, you know I got a bunch
And when I get high, I eat on Crunch 'n Munch
I might be in the A , I might be in the H
The say, "I'm so bomb when they see me in L.A."

[Bridge]
I love Crunch 'n Munch, flavor butter toffee
If you ain't put 5 on the weed, get off me (3x)

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Lil' momma cute, lil' momma fine
But if she don't pay half she won't be smokin' mines
Cause if you smoke with me, you gotta pay a fee
Cause I gotta keep Crunch 'n Munch and weed next to me

I got some Crunch 'n Munch, I got some killer dro
And when I run out I go and get some mo' (2x)

[Bridge]

[Verse 3:]
Now if you ain't a smoker this song ain't for you
I made it for my smokers who be high bangin' screw
Some eat on honey buns but I like Crunch 'n Munch
Some like to drank liquor but I like purple punch

I'm high off the dro, peddle to the flo
I need some Crunch 'n Munch so I'm headed to the sto (2x)
