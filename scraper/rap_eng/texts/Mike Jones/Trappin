[Intro: Mike Jones]
Trappin' all day by the store
Gotta make the money make more money
What you know about it?

[Verse 1: Mike Jones]
Some be at the store, I'm in the studio
40 for the brick, I whip it up when I spit the flow
"Who? Mike Jones" travel 'cross the globe
Yeah, they hate, but they don't know me, though
In that new coupe, deuce out through the roof
Your ho, she cute
Yeah, she wanna come with me, too
I'm out here chasin' paper on that money train
Your lil' momma all aboard the money train
She just wanna ride, wanna be by my side
24 hours, I'm on the grind until I die
She just wanna ride with me, yeah
She just wanna floss
She don't wanna be with you, boy
She wanna be with a boss
She want a hustler
She want a nigga that's on the grind
If you don't hustle, my boy, you wastin' your time
She want a hustler
She want a nigga that's on the grind
If you don't hustle, to her, you're wastin' your time
Even though you rappin', you trappin'
She ain't trippin', she with it
Cause she love your ambition
She love the fact you go get it
Even though you rappin', you trappin'
She ain't trippin', she with it
Cause she love your ambition
She love the fact you go get it, nigga, you-
