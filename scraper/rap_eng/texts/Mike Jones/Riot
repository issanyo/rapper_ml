Where's Mike Jones?
Living Legends
Slim

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
I got a Phantom on my necklace
Drank 'cause I'm from Texas
My white cup muddy as fuck
We drink the shit for breakfast
I'm in the club so turnt up
Bad bitches got me surrounded
Smokin' kush, high as fuck
But, I'm still tryin' to stay grounded
Where my lighter? Oh shit, I found it
Whole time, had it in my hand
Hell yeah, I'm that fucked up
Car full of that contraband
Tell you friend, don't tell your man
'Cause you're coming home with me tonight
She say I get her wetter than a river
Hell yeah, we gonna see tonight
You rollin' with a G tonight
Matter of fact, it's plus two
I'm fuck her, then fuck you
You don't tell on her, she won't tell on you
That's the type of shit that I do
Hogg life, all night
What's that up in your cup?
Stop lyin', that's all Sprite
Drop the marrow, all white
Bogardin' down [?]
Dressed up in the best designer
Your bitch cool, but mine finer
I wine 'n' dine her like it ain't shit
I'ma eat good with any bitch I'm with
But that's about all she gonna get
Only thing I give is dick
You need a purse? Go break a trick
I'm a pimp, not a simp
Peep the walk, I got a [?] limp
Eddie V's, order stuffed shrimp
My bitch bad when she wake up
Don't need weave or makeup
I think she 'bout a double D
But, she used to be a' A-cup

[Verse 2: Mike Jones]
Multi plaques, I got it
H-Town in my pocket, niggas
Hated on me, now they waitin' on me
Like, "Mike Jones, let's squash it"
I set trends like a trendsetter
Y'all gettin' good, but I been better
I been away, but I must say
I just got paid, so that's more chedder
I been cashin' out before cashin' out
Showin' two chains 'fore 2 Chainz
Hundred pounds, I just lost
So, your ho [?] my new flame
Ice Age, Money Train Gang
Back more money, back more game
I just got me a new cheque
So this new car, I can't wait to swang
Bad bitch, she can't wait to hang
She so insane, when I say my name
She a bad bitch, in a bad whip
With a' A-1 nigga, so she can't complain
I rep the H and stack up the M's
Used to be 300, now I'm superslim
Hoes at first, be like "I don't know"
But, when they hear my voice
They like "Yeah, that's him"
Hoes love it
Haters hate it
Well, leave that with them haters, then
We free from labels, we free from fakers
With a new cheque and new dough to spend
84's when our corner bend
Can't step outside without Benjamin's
Can't step outside without Benjamin's
Can't step outside without Benjamin's
Top down, with the butter showin'
The [?] got her face glowin'
She blowin' me like my name blowin'
Lawsuits, finally got 'em clear
And I bring my money back over here
My old money, now new money
Left old hoes and got new hundreds
My new money got me super fresh
Swag tight, super cheque
My multi plaque with my name on it
I show you boys how to super flex
Before Nike I was checkin' shit
Spread the word, I'm back wreckin' bitch
Where's Mike Jones?
Ice Age
Coming Soon
Money Train
