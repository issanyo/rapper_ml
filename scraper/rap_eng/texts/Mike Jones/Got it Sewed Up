[Intro]
The world finna know Mike Jones, man
Mike Jones
Swishahouse
Come here, Watts

[Hook, 2x]
Purple drank I’ma pour up
Got the rap game sewed [up]
See my grill they like hold up
Invisible set, princess [cut]

[Verse]
Hoes peep when I creep up the block
Dope fiend beep me when he need some rocks
Add 20s, subtract the top
I’m pimping hard in the parking lot
Screens fall when I lean in the truck
Candy paint, four screens on buck
No game needed to pull a slut
I just open mouth and show princess cuts
I pack a 9 at all times
I shine a lot ’cause I grind for mine
Why hate on me? And you far behind
You wasting time by talking down
You considered trash and I’m in my prime
You feeling bad and I’m feeling fine
’Cause *Who is Mike Jones* coming
*Who is Mike Jones* coming
I get you crunk when I open my mouth
My diamonds shine every time I talk
I spit a verse, head straight to the vault
’Cause Mike Jones can’t take a loss
I get you crunk when I open my mouth
My diamonds shine every time I talk
I spit a verse, head straight to the vault
’Cause Mike Jones can’t take a loss

[Hook, 2x]

[Verse]
M.O.B till the day I go
Got a Range Rove on 84s
On a microphone I shine and glow
I scream my name till the day I go
I hit the scene, Lac candy green
Or candy blue, when I’m with my crew
I represent, we drinking screw
I represent, we drinking screw
Michael Watts, he chopping it up
Cocaine, I’m rocking it up
Your gal fine, I’m knocking her up
Your gal fine, I’m knocking her up
I got a plan, got in demand
Now I hit the road and start stacking grands
I’m running the game with my master plan
I’m running the game with my master plan
281-330-8004
Here’s the number you can hit me on
When you call, ask for Mike Jones
281-330-8004
Here’s the number you can hit me on
When you call, ask for Mike [Jones]

[Hook, 2x]

[Verse]
Purple drink I’ma grip and sip
Anything illegal, you know I’ll flip
I roll slab with my pistol grip
Diamonds shining behind my lip
I hit the club a hundred deep
With a hundred sweets and a hundred freaks
On the mic, you can’t compete
’Cause Mike Jones is in the streets
I’m gripping grain, switching lanes
Causing pain in the turning lane
In seven months I’m running the game
Just ask the streets what is my name
I’m gripping grain, switching lanes
Causing pain in the turning lane
In seven months I’m running the game
Just ask the streets what is my name

[Outro]
Mike Jones
Mike Jones
Who?
Mike Jones
Yeah
