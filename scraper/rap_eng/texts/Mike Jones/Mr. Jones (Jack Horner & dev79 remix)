[Verse 1]
I'm back on these tracks about to sell another mill
My pants stay saggin' from them hundred dollar billz
These haters hate but they don't really wanna see the steel
These haters hate but they don't really wanna see the steel
Had a million in my bank before Asylum bought the deal
Had a million in my bank before Asylum bought the deal
Before I came out they say the streets wouldn't feel
The shit that I'm spittin the shit that's real
But now I'm like Mello I'm the king of the hill
American dream im livin' that for real
Eleven cars lata nigga tell me how you feel
Took the diamonds out my teeth and put them on my phantom grill (Smile, ha ha)

Cuz you'll never (Who?) catch Mr. Jones(Who?) (Mike Jones)

[Verse 2]
I used to get dissed by the chicks in the club
Now they want to rub my belly wanna show ya boy some love
They see me iced up they be like wassup?
Try to jack me if u wanna I'ma leave u f**ked up
Used to roll hatch back now I'm Cadillac and Benz
Used to roll hatch back now I'm Cadillac and Benz
I used to have homies now I'm like f**k friends

Cause even back then all they did was pretend
Now I got my own lable Ice Age and I'm boss
I'm the mayor of this town with the key to that Vault
All my cars black on black except the one with big gloss
Got another white on white I call that hoe Rick Ross (Ross)(Hahaa)
