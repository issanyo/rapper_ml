Don't call me baby
When she is waiting in the car
It took so long to get this far
Don't call me baby

You said forever
And then you went and changed your plans
You said that someday I would understand
But I still wonder

I wonder why we are not walking
And fighting and asking for favours
Meeting at midnight
While avoiding all the neighbours
Time is a distance that you can't retract by miles
If I saw you again I'd smile
But I'd say
Don't call me baby

When she is waiting in the car
It took so long to get this far
Don't call me baby

I think she's pretty
And I think that you have done quite well
I still say you can never tell
I wouldn't be surprised

You'll never know
We could be walking
And fighting and asking for favours
Meeting at midnight
While avoiding all the neighbours
Time is a distance that you can't retract by miles
If I saw you again I'd smile
But I'd say
Don't call me baby

When we were not the way we are
It took so long to get this far
Don't call me baby

Sometimes I'm down
I think I see you
But I don't say a word
Because there is somebody new
It's too late to matter
But no such thing is true
You're in the shadows
Til you left me in the dark

Don't call me x3
Don't call me baby x4

Don't call me baby
Don't call
Don't call me baby
Til fade.......
