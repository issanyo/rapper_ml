You can ride all day long
Another Mike Diesel production
(Mike Jones)
But you'll never catch Mr. Jones
He's got a gang that's far too strong
(Ice Age, Ice Age, Ice Age)
Your friends know it, that's why you're all alone
Chasing a man you can't see
(Mike Jones)
So just walk away and let him be
He's got a shot*** so go back home
(Who? Who?)
'Cause you'll never get Mr. Jones
(Mike Jones)
I'm back my music tracks about to sell another meal
My pants they saggin' from them hundred dollar billz
These haters hate but they don't really wanna see the steal
These haters hate but they don't really wanna see the steal
Had a million in my bank before I solemn bought the deal
Had a million in my bank before I solemn bought the deal
Before I came I just say the streets wouldn't feel
The s*** that I'm spittin', the s*** that's real
But now I'm like mellow I'm the king of the hill
American dream I'm livin' that for real
Eleven Corvette a *** tell me how you feel
The diamonds on my teeth
And put them on my phantom grill, smile, ha ha
You can ride all day long

But you'll never catch Mr. Jones

I used to get fist by the chicks in the club
Now they want to rub my belly, wanna show ya boy some love
They see me iced up, they be like wassup?
Try to jack me if you wanna, I'ma leave you f***** up
Used to roll hatchback now, I'm Cadillac and Benz
Used to roll hatchback now, I'm Cadillac and Benz
I used to have homies, now I'm like *** friends
'Cause even back then all they did was pretend
Now I got my own label Ice Age and I'm boss
I'm the mayor of this town with the key to that boss
All my cars black on black except the one with big gloss
Got another white on white I call that Rick Ross, Ross
You can ride all day long

(You can't see me baby)
So just walk away and let him be
He's got a shot*** so go back home
