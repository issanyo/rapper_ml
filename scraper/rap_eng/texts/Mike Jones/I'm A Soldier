(feat. Michael Watts)

(I'm a soldier)

[Mike Jones:]
Born and raised Im gettin paid
On a gettin dough way
Im on a minimum wage
Im on the cock with my Glock
And a hand full of cocks
They ain't leavin from the block
Till I fully get cock
Hot, the love from around
Is mike jones moves around
But when the law leave the block
I got cum a?ll around
Back doing
One won't do it
2 choises
Be scared or persue it
The game, is risky but it pays a lot of change [x2]
I give wood to my hoods
Through the woods now Im paid
Im happy with the favours
More Happier with change
Be Gay
People wanna hang when they see your heavy thing
Greening when ?ou? blow ?em
We go?n break em off for change
I was bored by myself
Gonna die by myself
You wanna have change
You better get em by yourself
As im on get a bit husla, soldier
Thought I told ya
Ain't afraid to move boulders
We freak around gangs?dont?t worth the doing
But right now Mike Watts is choppin an screwin it
Hold up watts, the fun just begun
I told you i dont rap for fun, i rap for funds Use me, you touch me minus your future
Cos my name will ryme like one loop?hole, they grin, it took me a while to get a lot of these grins
Now my ?ho?hole is right around my foreskin
Thanks to my fans my name is an anthem, who Mike Jone [x3]

[Micahel Watts:]
I bin dipping lots of years in the shit
Im michael watts the limping legend and I still want dick
Like mike jones say in this ryme you dont work you dont beat you dont rhyme you dont shine
Im bin down but I couldn't stay down
I got tired of being poked so I switched the shit around
I can't stop won't stop won't quit
While crammed in the slammer ?bout to pump the bumper kid
I'm real but I changed my name, I slide paper chains with my hand on the brain
Switch your house we first not last
Evything I sit on got wood up in class
