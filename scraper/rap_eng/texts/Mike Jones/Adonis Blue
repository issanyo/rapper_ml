I'll give myself a vision for a boy for this one girl
He can be the colors of a paintbox set in a black
And white world. He'll be a bit of everything, be the
Silver in the clouds, be a whisper silent as a
Kiss or a scream that's just as loud. I know he
Can be found
Adonis blue, Adonis blue. Sad like me but he's
Always smiling. You can't find me I can't find you
You're tried and true. It's only you adonis blue
He'll be the stroke of midnight or the mornings
Faithful rise. Be the music buried in the garden of
A church like the loveliest surprise. I heard there
Isn't anyone, that the breed has long been gone
I still not sure that I'm convinced gonna try to
Prove them wrong. Gonna look and look hard and long
Wish upon a star, pull the petals from a flower
Make a special wish when the clock strikes certain hours
Blow out the candles on the cake, pitch the pennies in the
Fountain. God speed him to me. I promise I'll be good
I'll be waiting by the window, I'll be sitting in the dark. He's
Just gotta be there 'cause I've looked so very hard
Adonis blue he's a boy come true, a little bit of him, a little of
You. Cherub face with those dug in heels. He's everything I
Mean. He's everything I feel. Rag doll singing in the slippery
City rain, plugging in my circuits. Dancing in my brain. Adonis
Blue. He's a boy divine. Gonna to try to find him. Gonna make
Him mine. If I only knew adonis blue. I'll give myself a vision
