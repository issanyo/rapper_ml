Did you see the stylish kids in the riot
They were shovelled up like muck
Set the night on fire
Wombles bleed truncheons and shields
You know I cherish you my love

But there s a rumour spread nasty disease around town
Caught round the houses with your trousers down
A headrush in the bush
You know I cherish you my love
Oh how I cherish you my love

Tell me what can you want now you've got it all
Ahh the scene is obscene
Time will strip it away
A year and a day
And Bill Bones
Bill Bones he knows what I mean

Yes it's eating, it's chewing me up
It s not right for young lungs to be coughing up blood
Oh it s all
It's all in my hands
And its all up the walls

The stale chips are up and the hopes stakes are down
Its all these ignorant faces that bring this town down
Yeah I sighed and sunken with pride
Well I passed myself down on my knees
Yes I passed myself down on my knees

What can you want now you've got it all
She says it's obscene
Time will strip it away
A year and a day
And Bill Bones
Bill Bones he knows what I mean

There are fewer more distressing sights than that
Of an Englishman in a baseball cap
Yeah we'll die in the class we were born
That s a class of our own my love
Were in a class of our own my love

Did you see the stylish kids in the riot
We were shovelled up like muck
Then set the night on fire
Wombles bleed truncheons and shields
You know I cherish you my love
Oh how I cherish you my love
