Intro: (0:00:00 - 0:00:27)
You know alot of us go to drugs, alcohol
Pornography
Go to whatever we can to not serve God
But thanks to God, we make history
Thanks to God, we made history
When Jesus Christ sacrified his life
On the cross for us

Chorus: (0:00:28 - 0:00:58)
We just wanna thank the Lord
(for makin history)
Independently
And claimin victory

God is the man with power
Love, and control
He is the true King
And the Lord and Savior

Without the creator
The Protector
The Lord and Savior
And the Provider

We would be lost
Bound and goin to Hell
But thanks to God and
Jesus Christ
We get to make it in life

Verse 1: (0:00:59 - 0:01:57)
We get a 2nd chance at this life
All thanks to Jesus
All thanks to Jesus sacrifin his life
For all of us out there in the world
If it wasn't for Jesus
We would be "The Devil Angel's"
We would be apart of "The Devil sins"
We would apart of his Demons
We would be apart of his mistakes
We would be apart of his mistakes
In life, in Hell, but thanks to God and Jesus
We get ta go to "Heaven"
We get to make it in "Heaven"
We get to say that we saved
Sanctified, and filled with the sweet Holy Ghost
Everyday
I wanna thank my Lord and Savior
For gettin under the blood
I wanna thank my Lord and Savior
For gettin saved again
I wanna thank my Lord and Savior
For comin back to him
I wanna thank my Lord and Savior
For being apart of his life
I wanna thank my Lord and Savior
For everybody in the world
Hopefully one day we all get ta
Be in "Heaven"

Chorus: (0:01:57 - 0:02:27)
We just wanna thank the Lord
(for makin history)
Independently
And claimin victory

God is the man with power
Love, and control
He is the true King
And the Lord and Savior

Without the creator
The Protector
The Lord and Savior
And the Provider

We would be lost
Bound and goin to Hell

Verse 2: (0:02:27 - 0:03:27)
Why would you want to be in "The Porn Industry"
Why would you wanna do drugs
Alcohol, and sex
Why would you wanna be apart
Of "The Devil sins"
When you get ta "Have It All"
When you go up to "Heaven"
Alot of times people, start off in church
But then they backslid
They turn there back away from God
Not because they had to
Because it's there desire
Because it's there ability
To hang with other people
It's there ability to impress there friends
It's there ability to have sex with everybody
You (really) don't have to have all that
To be with God
You don't have to have all that
To live your life
All ya need is the Lord and Savior Jesus in your life
All ya need is the blood, to wash away ya sins
So come back to "Jesus" before it's too late
Because once your "Hell Bound"
Your not (Really) gettin up again

Chorus: (0:03:27 - 0:04:25) (Twice)
We just wanna thank the Lord
(for makin history)
Independently
And claimin victory

God is the man with power
Love, and control
He is the true King
And the Lord and Savior

Without the creator
The Protector
The Lord and Savior
And the Provider

We would be lost
Bound and goin to Hell
But thanks to God and
Jesus Christ
We get to make it in life
