[Mike Jones]
First of all I must confess
I'm loved sick to the chest
With you under my arms girl I thank the Lord that I'm blessed
Girl I know I look like a thug, dress-dress like a thug
I can't help it I'ma thug, that's enough (Mike Jones)
Ain't gotta sex all the time, bump and grind all the time
You good qual, I just-I just want some quality time
And I'll show you that I'm good, not just in bed, instead overall
Just call and Mike Jones is gon' crawl
To ya house, and make ya scream and shout
Cuz pleasin' you girl is what Mike Jones is about
Baby girl when I start stackin' this paper, me and you gon' live gravy
We gon' move outta Tex and have estates in Jamaica
