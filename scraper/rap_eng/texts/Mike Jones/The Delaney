[Verse 1]
On the bus the other day
You could tell right from the start
There's magic in all that you play
But can you play guitar, boy
Can you play guitar
The truth is known the drums they roll
I loop the loop on the old banjo

[Chorus]
Say no no no
Say yeah yeah yeah
I said maybe maybe maybe
I just don't care

[Verse 2]
No it doesn't rhyme with treachery
Nothing I never did
Measure out your honesty and
Things you keep in
Things they keep in
The truth is known the drums they roll
I loop the loop on the old banjo

[Chorus]
Say no no no
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh maybe maybe maybe
I just don't care

[Verse 3]
Some people run from trouble
Some people meet it half way
Others are glad to pay
Their cab fare over
Enjoy the company?
What exactly do you mean
The truth be known the drums they roll
I loop the loop on the old banjo

[Chorus]
Say no no no
Then said yeah yeah yeah
Oh maybe
I just don't care
