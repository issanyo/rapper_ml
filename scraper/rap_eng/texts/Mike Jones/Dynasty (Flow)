[Mike Jones]
I'ma, go getter, cash flow flipper
Straight from the jungle so call me a gorilla
I got cash but I stay grindin' for more figures
For the scrilla I'll move a brick quicker then the next nigga
I got bling all up in my teeth (Mike Jones!)
I run the game so I'm the king of the streets
Niggas showed beef cuz I'm on top
Before the fame they ain't care if I was dead or not
But now I'm hot they wanna baller block, scheme and plot
Tryna do whatever it takes to take me out
I wonder why cuz I'm on top of the game and mad at that
Once I blow yo career you can have it back
But until then I'm flippin' 'fins stackin' benjamin's
Tryna get me and my family in a benz
So I grind, hopin' one day I'll shine
Leavin' haters behind, so if you wanna shine
You better wait in line
