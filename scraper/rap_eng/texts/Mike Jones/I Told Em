[Hook]
Call me when you need me, when you wanna see me
Call me when you need me, when you wanna see me
Call me when you need me, when you wanna see me
And I'll be right there, whenever you need me, girl

[Verse 1]
Girl, I want your mind and your body
Me 'n' you together, we ain't got to tell nobody
Go somewhere that's private
Take you somewhere private
Ain't nobody gonna see us leave
'Cause girl, we flyin' private, girl
Take you on an island
GV to the island
Me 'n' you, we chillin', baby
Me 'n' you, we wildin', girl
Girl, I want your mind and your body
Me 'n' you together, we ain't got to tell nobody
Go somewhere that's private
Take you somewhere private
Ain't nobody gonna see us leave
'Cause girl, we flyin' private, girl
