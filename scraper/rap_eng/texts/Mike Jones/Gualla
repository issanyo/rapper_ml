[Intro: Mike Jones]
Money train, money train
All aboard, all aboard
Oh Mike Jones, oh Mike Jones
Mike Jones

[Verse 1: Mike Jones]
Money, money I make it
Never [?]
Your main chick she chasing me
I ain't got no time for no chasing
Y'all chasing tail, I'm chasing mail
Big Ben Frank what I'm thinkin'
I smoke the loud, I sip the drank
I keep two cups when I'm drankin' baby
84's when I'm tippin'
Got your bitch and she trippin'
My top up, now my top down
I ain't got no time bitches
I said 84's when I'm tippin'
Got your bitch and she trippin'
My top up, now my top down
I ain't got no time bitches
I swear Zaytoven on the track
Smug Mang where you at
Money train been running thangs
And that there's a fact
I swear Zaytoven on the track
Smug Mang where you at
Money train been running thangs
And that there's a fact
I got money coming in stacks
Money coming in stacks (gold checks)
My first alb' went multi plat'
I been been on stacks
I said I got money coming in stacks
Money coming in stacks (gold checks)
My first alb' went multi plat'
I been been on stacks

[Verse 2: Chris Travis]
Young Memphis nigga, bitch better watch what you say
In the bat mobile letting my star tires skate
These niggas talk about me but they ain't 'bout nothing
Niggas wanna buy lean but we charging them muscle
Got bad yellow bitch, thick bone by the muscle
I ain't worried 'bout these niggas, give a damn if you struggle
Bitch I'm workin' hard everyday, forcin' new money
Still count old bills, nigga fuck the new hundreds

[Verse 3: Smug Mang]
Smuuug Muuusiiic
They call me Smug Mang, I got syrup in my mud
Young king from the north with a dirty sprite plug
And all these ratchet [?] cause they know what's up
And I'm fuckin' with the money train, I'm so cashed up
Coolin' in the underground till I fuckin' blow up
And I ain't never leave the house without my Xans and my cup
And if you really drinkin', pour some more
Northern border takin' order, they callin' Smug
Chris Travis, Mike Jones, they my down south plugs
