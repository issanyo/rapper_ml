(Twista)
It's ya boy Twista
Wit my Texas Connects
You know tha business
Bun and Froze up in this here
It's what I'm talking 'bout
We ridin' them Cadillacs
It's the Remix
Who in here?

(Bun B)
Big Bun B-dah up in here, yea
Know what I'm sayin'
Big Will Records up in here, yea
We talkin bout dem Caddy's baby dem Hogs
Beatin yo block, takin up the whole street
Know what I'm sayin?

Twista:
When I pull up in tha black Cadillac
Know its me from the smell of my skunk
Touch screen computers, seven TV's and twelve 12's in my trunk
With the new Kamikazee's, but I still roll smooth when I pull up on 0's
STV's, classic coups, custom grill, all gold
I'm the one that they be hatin' on
You got a Lexus
But my Fleetwood is what she waitin' on
From Chi to Texas
I got a brand new 85
Blow out tha brains when I'm ready
Cadillacs and Benzes is the only thing that's fuckin (?)

Bun B:
This dedicated to Deville's, (?) and da Brougham
The Vogue tennis shoes wit 23" chrome
From slat back Sevilles, L-Doggs and Coupes
The candy paint coat with peanut-butter rag roof
The wood grain wheel, Buck how it stitched and cut
Hit yo corner leanin' on 3's, not giving a - hold up
Man yo foreign might cost, but your foreign ain't wreckin'
My candy slab will break you off in a second, stop disrespectin'

(Chorus)

Mike Jones:
I'm jammin' SwishaHouse and Big Wheel inside my Cadillac
I'm grippin' wood in my Fleetwood when my Tv's fall flat
I gotta DTS, DHS, and a couple of EXT's
I got 22's crawlin' on all cars and SUV's
I'm Mike Jones, who? - Mike Jones, Jones
They stay grindin' and stay shinin'
In that Cadillac on chrome
I hit the boulevard lookin' like a mack
Jammin' screw in my Cadillac
Trunk blew, tipped cracked
Hate to do it but it's like that
I payed the cost to be the boss
So now I shine when I floss
I put 5,000 in my mouth
The next to blow up Down South
Who Mike Jones comin' soon
Just bought a 'Lac off show-room floor
Lettin' you know I'm the realest on this ho
281-330-8004, that's my cellphone number
Hit me up on the low
My album, Who Is Mike Jones? comin' soon
My album, Who Is Mike Jones? comin' soon

(Chorus)
You can bump this in yo Cadillac! Yo Cadillac!
You can bump this in yo Cadillac! Yo Cadillac, nigga!
You can bump this in yo Cadillac! Yo Cadillac! (yea)
You can bump this in yo Cadillac! Yo Cadillac, nigga! (Big Wheel Records)
You can bump this in yo Cadillac! Yo Cadillac! (With Mike Jones, Who? Mike Jones, Who? Swisha House)
You can bump this in yo Cadillac! Yo Cadillac, nigga! (yea)

You can bump this in yo Cadillac! Yo Cadillac, nigga! (We steady bumpin this in our Cadillacs's baby!)
