Hey boy I got so many ways
Ways to get paid
Twenty four hours
Money to be made

Now I'm platinum black mase
Back then ?? women
Now they all up in my thang
I fall up in the club
Twenty fours a nub
Yeah my belly big but girls still rub
They tryin to take me home
Wanna to be my cuddy buddy
So I gotta "day and night" like Kid Cudi
Especially wanna love me
She wanna thug me
I can take your girl away from you

Boi trust me
But I ain't even trippin

Too much money on my mind to worry about women
But you can catch me flossin
Crawlin on them inches
Fall up in the club
