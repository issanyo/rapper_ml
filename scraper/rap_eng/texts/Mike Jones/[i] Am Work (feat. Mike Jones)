So Let me see you work

[Verse 1: Justin Hibbert [i]]
(Yeah)
Loading Super Bowls
Championships
College chicks
Take her mind off her scholarship
Counting G's
Gaining R-E-S-P-E-C-T
You got locks?
We got keys
Average dudes
Girls with C's
Producing profit
Stop it with that gossip
Get on top of this
Let me feel your asaphagus
I used to give an uh
Now I give an uh less
Cause I make more
Gamble with my life
Place your bets
Oh
To my surprise
I'm alive
Per diem gives me low eyes
They better have my room tight
Aight
Green medical
Pick a chemical
Divide the decimal
Your legacy's only real
If it's testable
Mistress and a days in
The Mayans were out dated
So it's a new calendar I'm making
Put it all on the line to make it again
Let me see you work go stupid
No slave
No Cupid
Deserves a whipping
The way she move it

[Chorus: Justin Hibbert [i] & Female]
Let me see you
Work
Work
Work
Work
Let me see you
Work
Work
Work
Work
Let me see you
Work
Ah yea
Let me see you
Work
Ah yea
Let me see you

[Verse 2: Mike Jones]
Everyday I work
My name is my work
She see me in the club
She gonna stop, drop, twerk
Who? Mike Jones
And that won't change
I'm in that rover range
And I'm working on your dame
She got me switching lane to lane
One hand on that grain
What you claim?
Man I represent that money train
Work
Work
Everyday I work
Everyday I get paid
And do more work
Work
Work
Everyday I work
Everyday I get paid
And do more work
Little mama she gonna drop skirts
All I had to do was pull up in that Benz first
Soon as I say who she like what it do?
On my way to her so I can do her fool
Soon as I say who she like what it do?
On my way to her so I can do her fool

[Chorus: Justin Hibbert [i] & Female]
Let me see you
Work
Work

Let me see you
Work
Work

Work
Let me see you
Work
Ah yea
Let me see you
Work
Ah yea
Let me see you
Work
