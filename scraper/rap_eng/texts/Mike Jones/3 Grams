Money Train
My life
High life
Mike Jones (Who?)

[Hook: Mike Jones]
Three grams in my Swisher, nigga
Went from bein' broke to bein' a rich nigga

[Verse 1]
Yo, hold up
Three grams in a Swisher, nigga
If it ain't 'bout the money, get up out my [?] nigga
All these [?] call me club Godzilla, nigga
Hit that Matrix when a bitch try to kiss a nigga
Bendin' corners in that Benz on them inches, nigga
If a bitch rollin' with me, she look exquisite, nigga
Jacker run up on my window, leave him missing, nigga
Make that boy disappear like a wizard, nigga
Hold up. Club god I'm [?]
H-Town nigga, deuce out the roof
Your baby momma rollin' with me in the coupe
She wanna blow a nigga like a flute
Got a big, six-bedroom, house in the wilderness
And I fuck your hoes in it
Hold up
I'm from H-Town, bitch
That ain't no slab if it ain't got no 84's with it
Hold up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Three grams in my Swisher, nigga
Went from bein' broke to bein' a rich nigga
'Member me instead, goin' half on a nick', nigga
Now, I'm only rollin' up ape's out the zip, nigga
Higher than a clip, nigga
Tryin' catch a play or a lick
Cause a broke nigga never did shit, nigga
No need for favors, I ain't ask my neighbor
Tellin' all them labels, "I ain't signin' shit", nigga
Called up Skip
He said he just got in some piff
And he had a good deal on the split, nigga
OK fo' sho'
I'm on the way to the sto'
I'm only tryin' to smoke
Ain't fitna flip, nigga
Three different buds, we blow just because
I swear my eyes feel tighter than a grip, nigga
It's the money train
Your ass ain't got no money, man
You might as well close your fuckin' lips, nigga
What, motherfucka?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Three grams in my Swisher, nigga
A lot of gold [?] issue, nigga
The '87 with the glass that I'm pullin' out
Twenty four inches, [?] like what they talkin' 'bout
Been a no limit soldier, feelin' like I'm Master P
And I don't make 'em say shit, but they pay a fee
I'm the dopest nigga in the motherfuckin' industry
Alot of gold and tattoos got 'em feelin' me
Cortez kings what these niggas really wanna be
Hot boy, Cash Money, [?] a G
Louisiana [?] shinin' for my nigga Snoop
Cause all my nigga ever wanted was a fuckin' coupe
Three grams in my Swisha, nigga
Light it up and pray for it like a bishop, nigga
If you ain't talking 'bout money, I don't hear shit
This that three gram dope boy g-mix
I keep me...

[Hook]
