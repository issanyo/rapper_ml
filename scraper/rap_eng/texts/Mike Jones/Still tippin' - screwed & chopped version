~Paul Wall~
What they do this is Paul Wall im the people's champ
My chain light up like a lamp cuz now im back with the camp
Im probably similar to an ant cuz im low to da earth
People's feelings get hurt when they figure out what im worth
I got 84's pokin out at tha club im showing out
Ima playa ain't no doubt hoes wanna know what ima bout
Biggest diamonds off in my mouth prisious cuts on in my chain
Wood grain all in my range drippin stains when i switch lanes
Switch the name is still the same
Swisha House or Swisha blast mike jones he runnin the game and magnificent about his cash
Michael Watts he made me hott all worth to me to the top
He wrote a check and bought a truck
I got the internet going nuts but T Phere has got my back so now im holding my nuts
Its Paul Wall baby what u know bout me im on the five now south baby holla at me

(chorus)
Still tippin on volvos rapped in volvos(2x)

Rapped in volvos tippin volvos and now im back in volvos
