Girl I gotta be next to you {*2X*}

[Hook: NaeNae] + (Mike Jones) + {BOTH}
I'm waiting, anticipating
For you baby (cause I gotta be next to you)
And I'm wanting, you cause you got me
Boy you got me (cause I gotta be next to you)
(Ayyyy!) {Baby you on my mind}
{Long as we spending time girl} cause I gotta be next to you
{Baby you on my mind}
{Long as we spending time girl} cause I gotta be next to you

[Mike Jones]
I ain't trippin about the limelight
Cause when I'm with my shorty she keep my mind right
When we up in the mall, she fill up shopping bags
She love to pop them tags, she love to drive the Jag
Whenever we alone, she throw away my phone
Cause she don't want no interuptions while we goin strong
My baby, my baby, don't be on that bullshit
My baby, my baby, know I keep a full clip
That's why I, let her hi-side in 745
Thats why I, take pride when I slide up in them thighs
My baby boo she true, you know she hold me down
So when I get some time, I spend it with her now, YEAH!

[Mike Jones]
My lil' momma she know how the game go
She know if it's 'bout the money she know daddy gotta go
She know if it's 'bout the paper then paper I'm gon' get
Bring it back to the crib, then paper we gon' split
She understand what I do, she trust me and keep it true
Even though I leave her lonely she knows that I love her too
While I'm hot I gotta get it, gotta stay on the grind
And she already know when I'm home, she take all my time
I - love to cuddle up, love to make her blush
Girl I can't get enough, cause I gotta be next to you
Love to cuddle up, love to make her blush
Girl I can't get enough, cause I gotta be next to you

[Hook]
