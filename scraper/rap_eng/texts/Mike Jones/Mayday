A slaves a girl who slaves her days away
In arabesques & minarets
Tablecloths and serviettes
She's singing 'this is what you get'
First you put the tongue in then you put the boot in
Yeah yeah oh yeah
First you put the tongue in then you put the boot in
Yeah yeah oh yeah

The mob goes fifteen ways
I dunno which way to go
The mob goes fifteen ways
And my head (my poor head)
Feels like a smashed window

George is 24 he's easily bored
All his life he's seen nothing but closed doors
(not any more..)
First you put the tongue in then you put the boot in
Yeah yeah oh yeah
First you put the tongue in then you put the boot in
Yeah yeah oh yeah

And he mob goes fifteen ways
I dunno which way to go
The mob goes fifteen ways
And my head, my poor head
Feels like a smashed window
