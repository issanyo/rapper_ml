Mama brought her into the world
Like I'll let him buy you dinner tonight
Then at the end of the night

You see he dark, you always dim in his lights
And that girl wanna shine

That thing feel like la, la, la
And since he feed her lies
I'll be her dessert on the side

How u do ur lips like that
Move ur hips like that
Work ur ass like that?
Why u make noise like that
Move slow like that
Fuck fast like that?

Baby I ain't gon lie to you
We so sexually compatible
How I thrill myself
I could kill myself
When I feel myself

You could be cuddy buddy
Nibble on my nutty buddy
While we do some freaky things
Wit the lights on
Touching on you while
I'm listening to T-Pain
Hugging on you while
I'm listening to Mike Jones
Then as soon as we got in the sac
I can hit it in the back of the lack of
A fifth of the yac like like........that!

It's the middle of the night yall got into a fight
Now your mad with your feelings hurt

Tell me what you think

Pull up in the lack truck (beep, beep)
Be shorty back up (feed me)

Soon as he fell asleep
She on her way to love me
