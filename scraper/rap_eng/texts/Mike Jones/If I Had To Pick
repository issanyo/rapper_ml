[Hook]
If I had to pick
My money, my bitch
Bye bye, bitch
I gotta get rich

[Verse 1]
In it
If it come down to it, I don't love that ho
If I gotta pick, I'ma pick my dough
Drop it in the pot
Whip it up and get mo'
Spit straight pimp [?]
You know I gotta do it
Got a couple checks and I ran right through it
Got a couple hoes and I ran right through it
The only thing that hurt was the money when I blew it
If it come down to it, you know what I pick
MOB, money over my bitch
Grind hard cause I gotta get rich
And, I'ma keep ballin' cause I love this shit
And, I'ma keep thuggin, cause I love this shit
Money gon' always pull me a bitch
Press a button in the Benz and the seats do tricks
We be gettin' to the money
On the road hittin' licks
Keep it one hundred
I'm never gonna switch
Money Train, no politics
And if I ain't got money, I ain't got funds
If I ain't got funds, then I can't buy guns
If I can't buy guns, then these niggas try to jack
If it come down to it, would you have my back?
No, I ain't think so
I'ma leave it just like that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mike Jones]
I'ma chase the money
I don't chase these hoes
I stack, they slack. I'ma stack the dough
I'm about the money, I'm about the [?]
You don't work, don't eat
My nigga, all the time
You better stack you paper, be 'bout yourself
Fuckin' with these hoes'll have you by yourself
I'm laid back, but still paid up
I just grind and recline, no change ups
I said, I'm laid back, but still paid up
I just grind and recline, no change ups
I'm in the cut, still stackin' bucks
Don't worry 'bout me, just know I came up
Y'all know my name, y'all know what I claim
Make way, all aboard for the Money Train
Make way, all aboard for the Money Train
Make way, all aboard for the Money Train
Where's Mike Jones, that's on the way
Where's Mike Jones, that's on the way
Where's Mike Jones, that's on the way
Where's Mike Jones, that's on the way
Where's Mike Jones, that's on the way
Where's Mike Jones, that's on the way
Who? Mike Jones
That's all I got to say
