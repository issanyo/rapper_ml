[Intro]
I know y'all ain't want me to make it though (already know)
But it cool though
I remember when I used to never have shit, aye
But I always had a bad bitch
I remember when I used to never have shit
But I always had a bad bitch

[Verse]
I remember comin' up, all I had was a dream
No squad, no labels, no groupies, no team
My bitch coulda left too but she was on my team
Helped a nigga stay focused, stay mashin' for the cream
I used to sell CDs out my trunk tryin' to make it
They ain't wanna see me go platinum, so I had to take it
I used to sell CDs out my trunk tryin' to make it
They ain't wanna see me go platinum, so I had to take it
Ninety percent grind, ten percent sleep
You don't work, you don't eat
Everyday I wake up, I gotta creep
I gotta grind for the paper
My bitch was with me while I was grindin' for this paper
Now I pull up, Navigator
Alligator how I'm crawlin'
Yeah, they mad at me because I'm ballin'
Yeah, they mad at me because we ballin'
Money train, runnin' things, grippin' grain in the turnin' lane
I got your dame, and now she all on me
I told y'all back then, she ain't want me
Before nothin' else, I had hoes
But I ain't even trippin' on that though I'm after paper mane
I'm tryin' get this money mane I'm on this money train
Yeah, movin' so swiftly, my bitch was down with me so
When I came up you know I put her in that Bentley
Put her in that wagon, hoppin' out that wagon
Pants saggin' they like "Mike Jones, that boy braggin'"
Naw I ain't boastin'
Naw I ain't boastin'
Hop up out my whip and all the hoes approachin'
But I'm chillin' though, I got my bitch with me
We just chillin' though, I ain't tryin' to kick it
I one hundred, kept it one hundred
What you niggas tryin' to do, you know we been done it
Hit the mall, break the mall down
Eighty fours when we crawl through your town
Who? Worldwide
Mike Jones can't be denied

[Outro]
Money train, strong
You's a fool with this one
