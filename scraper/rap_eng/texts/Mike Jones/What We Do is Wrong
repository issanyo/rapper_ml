[Mike Jones]
I know, what I be doing is wrong
But I'm a hustler fo' life, fuck with two strikes
Give me that butter or all white, and I'm alright
Can't live minimum wage, cause that's just not my life
I roll up and down the block, on cutters
Hit the block move butter, cause I'm straight from the gutter
You leave her home alone, and I will fuck her
And when my money low, I abduct her
Hustler is what I am, kilos by grams
This a stick up man, get out your car man
Only way is to survive, if my AK jam
Like Jigga, I'm standing in my B-Boy stance
I make hoes kick in, like kicking a kick stand
I'm a man, and my two feet I use to stand
Cause I'm a man, who

Mike Jones Jones, coming soon

Uh, fa sho (even though what we do is wrong)

Until I die, I'ma forever bring pain
