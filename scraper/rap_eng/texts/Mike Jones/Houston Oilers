[INTRO]
Just because the team left, that don't mean I ain't no Houston Oiler
Icey, I'm a Houston Oiler, I'm a Houston Oiler
I'm from H-town and I love to drink that all up
I'm a Houston Oiler, I'm a Houston Oiler
I'm from H-town and I love to drink that all up
I'm a Houston Oiler, I'm a Houston Oiler
I'm from H-town and I love to drink that all up
I'm a Houston Oiler, I'm a Houston Oiler
Icey, Mike Jones

[VERSE I]
I'm landin' out the sky into my spaceship
She say my ? lookin better than her facelift
She love the candy swankin' with the bumper kit
She touch the butter and I cut, didn't have to say shit
I got her goin and in a mile (like I'm bankin with her)
That's why I know what she thinking, what she thinking nigga
Right now she wanna grab a pint of oil
I brought a hit and let her taste it, now I asked for it
She love them Houston Oilers, she love the drank we sip
She love the way the candy shine and how the fos flip
She know bout super pokers she know bout airbo's
That's why when she see em she can't keep her legs closed; I said
She love them Houston Oilers, she love the drank we sip
She love the way the candy shine and how the fos flip
She know bout super pokers she know bout airbo's
That's why when she see em she can't keep her legs closed

[Hook]
I'm a Houston Oiler, I'm a Houston Oiler
I'm from H-town and I love to drink that all up
I'm a Houston Oiler, I'm a Houston Oiler
I'm from H-town and I love to drink that all up
I'm a Houston Oiler, I'm a Houston Oiler
I'm from H town and I love to drink that all up
I'm a Houston Oiler, I'm a Houston Oiler
Icey, Mike Jones

[VERSE II]
Ay, I stay sippin lean sittin sideways
With some candy on fo's in your driveway
I'm shootin spiders in the nighttime
With something on me that'll have you on the lifeline
Yeah Im crawlin on them super pokers
Yeah I'm crawlin with that super soaker
So stay in your lane
(I'm smokin' on that purple with that purple in my drank)
The Houston Oilers ???
I'm number one like Warren Moon
Southside I see you candy red
My side candy blue, we all getting bread
And who are you?
I'm who, mike jones! Who? Mike jones!
Who the hell is that?
A playa that came out first album double plat
So all you hatas please, fall back

[Hook Repeats]

[VERSE III]
I can barely walk cause I'm leanin
I can I can barely I can barely walk cause I'm leanin
I can barely I can barely walk cause I'm leanin
She seen the eighty fo's and started feenin'
I can I can barely I can barely walk cause I'm leanin
I can barely I can barely walk cause I'm leanin
I can barely I can barely walk cause I'm leanin
She seen the eighty fo's and started feenin'
Drink in the Styrofoam I'm a Houston Oiler, I'm a Houston Oiler
I'm a Houston Oiler, sippin till I'm leanin
I'm a Houston Oiler, I'm a Houston Oiler
I'm a Houston Oiler eight fo's involved, got the girls screamin'
I'm a Houston Oiler, I'm a Houston Oiler
When I come through shinin' with my ride
I'm a Houston Oiler, I'm a Houston Oiler
