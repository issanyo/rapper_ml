Rolling down a lonely highway (repeat 3 times)
I see everything clearer now
Rolling down a lonely highway (repeat 3 tmies)
I see, I see everything clearer now

(Verse 1)
Uh, when it come to 24 hour fuckin' you know i dont (play around)
I need a massage from your lips is the only thing thats gonna (lay me there)
I need a freak everyday of the week thats gonna (fulfill my needs)
Your mouth hard but body and soul is the only thing that im (tryin' to please)

(Bridge)
I want your body (i want your body)
I really want your body (I really want your body)
I want your body (I need your body)
I really want your body

(Chorus)
Feels like I just walked right out of heaven
Feels like I damn to throw my life away
Sad just like a child thats lost at seven
Dont know what to do, to get back right with you

Feels like i just walked right out of heaven
Feels like I damn to throw my life away
Sad just like a child thats lost at seven
Dont know what to do, feels like i just walked right out of heaven
