It's like a jungle sometimes
It make me wonder
How I keep from under
Even Stevie can peep we asunder
Hard to focus on the sashimi I get at Sunda journalist read where the death toll  meet on every Sunda
Hard for me to attempt to compete with the plunderers
When they protected by silence, and others,  and codes and government
I'm on some other shit don't ask me how the summer went
When lil black boys and grown black women in America is smothering
Swallowed by the jungles
Blacks been getting Harambe'd
Old lynchings just on new tap
Damn thats digital
Damn this critical
Masters whip turned to a handgun
Oh what miracle
They truly believe that we are minimal that we are animals
They mouth is full of flesh when they call us cannibals
Spit  it out
Tell me what you think about what be happening round town
What be happening down south?

Today I heard the cops shot a man with my last name
He was tryna shoot the autistic kid but he had bad aim
The nations in an outrage
Troopers won't about face
Hooper got shot out west with promise
Of heading to the NBA
Now I gotta be clever with cops So they disengage
Disarm em with charm
All to make it to another day
The shits exhausting
Proceed with caution

It's like a jungle sometimes it make me wonder how i keep from going under
A ha ha ha ha

It's somethings I never understood will never understand
How cops could just kill a man
He was with his girl
You seen his empty hands
On they way to restaurant
Won't make those dinner plans
He gon get to walk
He gon make dinner plans
He gon get a contribution from the klan
He gon keep his job and pension, Uncle Sam
At the repass Auntie Tracy she gon make the yams
Damn
How yall tell me you don't see that shit?
I see racist muthafuckas everywhere I sit
They getting more and more bold with every tock that tick
How many motherfucking times yall gon say that's it?
How many motherfucking times they gon replay that shit?
How the fuck you on the force when you get scared so quick?
You should see em in the court man they turn red so quick
Beg and shit these muthafuckas heads so sick
