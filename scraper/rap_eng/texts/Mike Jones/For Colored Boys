It's Blackie
Fam was in the field fo iraqi
No matter how many cotton made polo and khakis
Pubic hair still nappy
I keep a cutie to distract me
From all of the ways they try to trap me
The truth is nasty
Little niggas is shootin past me
Im equipped with jordans boots steppin through the wrath
Never lettin it have me
The broads in my city ain't like Ilana an abbi
They brown with braids like patra and names like jackie
They pearling in my backseat
Unfurling the packed weed
Only arch is in my back I chase no hoe cuz I got flat feet
What the fuck you thought I'd say when you asked me
I'm the nigga till I pass and then AD
These raps is conversation and they AB
They never Choose the best option cuz  they can't see
And that's very my style
Pop up like banksy
Climbed up the ranks see
How a writer Gon rank me
Why the biters don't thank me
How that chronic so stanky
I ainâ€™t have no one permission to re arrange me

It's Skillet
My skin cast iron thick
Like what yo grandma fry that chicken wit
Cornbread from scratch no jiffy mix
My family put the sip In Mississip
This medication ain't come from no therapists
The pain of migration done took its trip
Or better Rather its toll
Make it the Greatest story that's told
At least
The city having a feast
A platter piled of flesh
Handkerchiefs in the collars of the beasts
Got the nerve to be fearful of my features
However they so cheerful when they reachin
Guns drawn quickly, sirens and tires screechin
9/11 has nothing on the heights that the fires reachin
Or the death toll in my hometown
They counting bodies  every time summer come round
It make you wanna drown
570 now

For colored boys
Who colored good with coloring books
On stage in dashiki panchos
Now we coloring hooks
In kitchens with marble tops
Where great grandmother cooked
Meals for other families, it was so nutritious
For them
For us
Well she died in 91
The other family got the cake
We just got the crumbs
All the work and school we do
Just tryna get some funds
Then end up filling holes
By digging some other ones
So it was liquor to our liver
It was smoke all in her lungs
Her lungs was black like me
Til she was wearing white like them
Highlighting this Dubois
They said I shouldn't do boys
Hardest life i probably wouldn'ta chose, I had choice
