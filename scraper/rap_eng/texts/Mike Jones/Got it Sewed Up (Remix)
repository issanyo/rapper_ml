[Hook: Mike Jones]
Purple drank I'mma po' up, got the rap game sewed up
They see my grill and like hold up, invisible set, princess cuts
Purple drank I'mma po' up, got the rap game sewed up
They see my grill and like hold up, invisible set, princess cuts

[Mike Jones]
Hoes peep when I creep up the block
Dopefiends beep me when they need some rocks
Add 20 subtract the top
I'm pimpin hard in the parkin lot
Screens fall when I lean in the truck
Candy paint, fo' screens on buck
No game needed to pull a slut
I just open mouth and show princess cuts
I pack a 9 at all times
I shine a lot cause I grind for mine
Why hate on me & you far behind
Wastin' time by talkin down
You considered trash and I'm in my prime
You feelin' bad & I'm feelin' fine
Cause "Who is Mike Jones?" is here
"Who is Mike Jones?" is here
I get you crunk when I open my mouth
My diamonds shine everytime I talk
I spit a verse head straight to the vault
Cause Mike Jones can't take a loss
I get you crunk when I open my mouth
My diamonds shine everytime I talk
I spit a verse head straight to the vault
Cause Mike Jones can't take a loss

[Mike Jones]
M.O.B. 'til the day I go
Got a Range Rov' on 80 4's
On the microphone I shine and glow
I scream my name 'til the day I go
I hit the scene, 'llac candy green
Or candy blue when I'm with my crew
I represent, we drink and screw
I represent, we drink and screw
Michael Watts, he choppin it up
Cocaine, I'm rockin it up
Yo' gal fine, I'm knockin her up
Yo' gal fine, I'm knockin her up
I got a plan, got in demand
Now hit the road and start stackin grands
I'm runnin the game with my masterplan
I'm runnin the game with my masterplan
2 8 1, 3 3 oh, eight zero zero fo'
Here's the number you can hit me on
When you call, ask for Mike Jones
2 8 1, 3 3 oh, eight zero zero fo'
That's the number you can hit me on
When you call, ask for Mike Jones

[Hook]

[Mike Jones]
Purple drank I'mma grip and sip
Anything illegal you know I'll flip
I roll the slab with my pistol grip
Diamonds shine from behind my lip
I hit the club a hundred deep
With a hundred sweets and a hundred freaks
On the mic you can't compete
Cause Mike Jones is in the streets
I'm grippin grain, switchin lanes
Causin pain in the turnin lane
In 7 months I'm runnin the game
Just ask the streets what is my name?
I'm grippin grain, switchin lanes
Causin pain in the turnin lane
In 7 months I'm runnin the game
Just ask the streets what is my name?
