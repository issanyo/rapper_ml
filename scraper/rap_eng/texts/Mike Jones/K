[Verse 1]
Back into that falling night
The birches and the silhouettes
The haunted plain
Sweet Lord, here I am again

[Chorus]
You flower through my nails and skin
Moving like the sunlight in the alleyways
But in this life
We won't meet again

[Chorus]
You flower through my nails and skin
Moving like the sunlight in the alleyways
But in this life
We won't meet again
