[Hook]
You can ride all day long
Another Myke Diesel production (Mike Jones)
But you'll never catch Mr. Jones (Mr. Jones)
He's got a gang that's far too strong (Ice Age Ice Age Ice Age)
Your friends know it, that's why you're all alone (All alone)
Chasing the man you can't see (Mike Jones)
So just walk away and let him be
He's got a shotgun so go back home (Who? Who?)
Cause you'll never get Mr. Jones (Mike Jones)

[Verse 1]
I'm back my music tracks about to sell another mil'
My pants they saggin' from them hundred dollar bills
These haters hate but they don't really wanna see the steel
These haters hate but they don't really wanna see the steel
Had a million in my bank before I solemn bought the deal
Had a million in my bank before I solemn bought the deal
Before I came I just say the streets wouldn't feel
The shit that I'm spittin' the shit that's real
But now I'm like mellow I'm the king of the hill
American dream I'm livin' that for real
Eleven Corvette a nigga tell me how you feel
The diamonds on my teeth and put them on my phantom grill (Smile, ha ha)

[Verse 2]
I used to get dissed by the chicks in the club
Now they want to rub my belly wanna show ya boy some love
They see me iced up they be like what's up?
Try to jack me if u wanna I'ma leave u fucked up
Used to roll hatchback now I'm Cadillac and Benz
Used to roll hatchback now I'm Cadillac and Benz
I used to have homies now I'm like fuck friends
Cause even back then all they did was pretend
Now I got my own label Ice Age and I'm boss
I'm the mayor of this town with the key to that vault
All my cars black on black except the one with big gloss
Got another white on white I call that ho rick Rick Ross (Ross) (Ha ha ha ha)
