Yes, Platinum Underground, April 1st baby
Geah! Mike Jones, comin soon ("Da Bottom bitch!")
A lot of people talkin 'bout they tough
How you tough workin at Babies 'R Us (they still talkin down)
You drop a CD without comin to me
That let me know that your hoe-ass weak (you still talkin down)
You pull a scheme tryin to come back out
Your CD drop and you still ain't hot (you still talkin down)
I heard about you bookin yo' own shows
And then I found out they all promos (you still talkin down)
The money you made offa yo' mixtape
You blew it all bookin free show dates (you still talkin down)
You and I know the only reason you sold
Was cause of me cause without me you shoulda been stuck in the sto' (true dat)
Now here's a challenge, can you do it, let's see
Drop a CD with no beats and see if it blow up the street (geah)
You get on radio, hatin on me
Now the underground game waitin on me to see (see what?)
If I'ma shoot back or ignore your bull
He got greedy with his team and left Paid in Full
Then went to the major labels by himself bein fly
But everywhere he go they be like where that Paul Wall guy?
He over here, so let's get somethin clear
You the past motherfucker and the future is here
And you was here befo' me so let this be a reminder

[Mike Jones]
Geah! Mike Jones
How the hell they tired of me and you been here since 9-9 nigga?
You the rapper they tired off
Geah! Swishahouse, I been here since 2002
Holdin it down baby
You had three years befo' ME! I gave you a head start
And you STILL couldn't fuck with me!
You STILL gettin paid less on shows, hoe-ass nigga
Been in this bitch since 9-9 and still ain't makin what I'm makin
Geah! How long they gon' wait baby?
You been here befo' me baby, GEAH!
{*explosion*} It's goin down
I'm the rapper they waitin for, you the rapper they tired of
