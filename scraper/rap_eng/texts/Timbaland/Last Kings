[Intro]
Clap for a nigga with his rapping ass
Blow a stack for a nigga with his trapping ass
Clap for a nigga with his rapping ass
Blow a stack for a nigga with his trapping ass
Last Kings, PNC, wavy

[Verse 1]
Straight riding 'round in my Paula, Forza shit stop hating bruh
Flight Clubs and Retro 5’s, I see the hate in your eyes
I'm an A1 nigga can't lose, Word Play will put you on the news
Got a plug that gets me rare shoes, shoutout them niggas from the Blues
That 50 thousand dude, App State gon need that soon
I make it rain cats and dogs, bitches call me monsoon
Niggas think that they special stunting with they niggas
Knowing damn well that they special in they mental
I’m in Chi-raq looking swelly with my blood
Red LK shirt looking like some blood
All this red is for my Chiefs, not for them bloods
Y'all sin everyday, yet drink Jesus Christ's blood

[Bridge]
Nigga I pop molly and rock Last Kings
Bitch ass niggas all gon be extinct
Kings never die nigga we distinct

[Chorus]
Last Kings (x4)

[Verse 2]
Word Play shops at AE and he shops at Zumiez
Like Twitter your girl gon follow me, this Last Kings hat is on me
Doing every drug with my hunkies
Egyptian head on me like I'm Illuminati
Word Play in the club all the bad bitches slid to me
Smoking this weed all the clouds around me
Nigga I hashtag and retweet nigga
140 dollars all for these sneaks nigga
Your bitch was at my crib and yes I got them cheeks nigga
Shoot you in the face and dump you in Dawson's Creek nigga

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
