[Intro]
VA, yeah, New York, Atlanta, DC
LA, New Jersey, Philly, say what, say what

[Verse 1]
You never know a good thing 'til I'm gone
And you'll be spending many, many nights home alone
You won't be seeing me around your way, no no
And if you don't get it together, baby, I can't stay

[Chorus]
Don't be comin' in my face tryna tell me you love me
You shoulda thought once or twice, sacrifice and make it right
It's the thing that you do, make me not love you
So just wait and you'll see, get no other love like me

[Verse 2]
You never know I'm for real until I leave, uh huh
And when I pack up my clothes, don't be calling me
You won't be seeing me anymore, no no
Cause when I'm long, long gone, I won't be back in this door

[Chorus]
Don't be comin' in my face tryna tell me you love me
You shoulda thought once or twice, sacrifice and make it right
It's the thing that you do, make me not love you
So just wait and you'll see, get no other love like me

[Verse 3]
To my east side people to my west side
To all my bitches who sat home crying
Over these niggas and over these fellas
Shake em off like Jello, uh huh
To my east side people to my west side
To all my bitches who sat home crying
Over these niggas and over these fellas
Shake em off like Jello, uh huh

[Chorus]
Don't be comin' in my face tryna tell me you love me
You shoulda thought once or twice, sacrifice and make it right
It's the thing that you do, make me not love you
So just wait and you'll see, get no other love like me

[Verse 4]
I used to stick closer to your side then a beeper
'Til you smoked that cheaper reefer
Now you loony as fita, shut up
Don't say a word, yep, I got the word
Yeah, I heard it from a little bird
Now I'm out the door about 44
You don't know?
Get your bags and your things take the door
Don't take this shit no more
When you leave, you can leave out the back door

[Outro]
Fucker, stupid niggas
Always think they can play somebody
Y'all know who y'all are
Tryna run about 3, 4, 5 women at one time
Then you wanna come back all in our faces
And tellin' me how much you love me and all that bullshit
Whatever man, fuck you
Alright, I'm out
