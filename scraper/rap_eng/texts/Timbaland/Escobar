[Intro — Goodfellas sample]
As far back I as could remember
I always wanted to be a gangster

[Verse 1]
Hey, pass the spliff and let me light it
I’m hanging with the titans, I’m eyeing to take the top
Possess the belt of Orion, ridin’ with LOGICLUB
Fuck the corporate giants, I’m eyeing to spread the love
The reason I be defyin’ the tyrants and politicians
Proudly in competition for money and tall hoes
And yet the public forgives ‘em
I’m driven to make a change
Spittin’ this propane
So listen and get addicted like money and cocaine
Watch me switch it, I’m shiftin’ on four lanes
Shootin’ with position it’s somethin’ like a Cobain
Blow your mind like Coltrane
I give you that supply in this verbally dope game
I’m dope man

[Refrain]
Yeah, so what’cha want from me?
What’cha want
What’cha want from me?
Heh, yeah, what’cha want from me?
What’cha want
What’cha want from me?

[Hook]
A little bit of weed
A bit of crack
A little bit of me, what’cha think about that?
A bit of weed
I like that
A little bit of me
Let me bring it right back yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2]
As a youngin’ I promised to follow dreams
And it’s funny how this life ain’t everything that it seems
The bigger picture, I wanna know what it means
I figured I’d get more figgas by stickin’ to my beliefs
I’m a fiend, a money-making machine, if you didn’t know
I ain’t tryin’ to fake it or ever make it identical
So baby let me switch your flow:
I don’t fuck around, unless I’m fucking with this inner flow
Get a bro on the mic, to do it better
To touch you with a speech that pisses like a Baretta
With a hundred rounds, I might be hated in the underground
Chillin’ in the cloud
I ain’t never ever comin’ down
This rap shit is an addiction
I’m wishin’ that this could turn to somethin’ more than fiction
The mission, is to make it just like Quentin
Tarantino if you were to ask another question
I’m a Reservoir bastard, they act hard, facts are
You be looking stupid when you act smart
I’m running circles ‘round your mind like a trackstar
Workin’ hard until I be the master

[Bridge]
I push flows and pack rhymes, I stack dimes for days
A modern-day don, you say
I push flows and pack rhymes, stack dimes for days
And I’m tryna be a don today, so I ask

[Refrain]
What’cha want from me?
What’cha want
What’cha want from me?
Now, what’cha want from me?
What’cha want
What’cha want from me?

[Hook]
A little bit of weed
A bit of crack
A little bit of me, what’chu think about that?
A bit of weed
I like that
A little bit of me
Let me bring it right back yeah

[Outro]
