HOOK:
We hustle in a little ol’ apartment/ (yes, sir)
Wit all the windows blacked out/
I’ll put that on the hood if you cross me/
I’ma have to pull the straps out/
You don’t know nothing about me/
You just be running’ your mouth/
Steady telling hoes when you see me/
You gonna take me out/
I'ma real nigga - come and give me hope/
I'ma real nigga - come and give me hope/
I'ma real nigga - come and give me hope/
I'ma real nigga - come and give me hope/

[Timbaland]
Aye, Aye, Aye…
You ol’ pussy ass, frontin’ ass, snitchin’ ass nigga/
Run up on you with chrome put the barrel to your temple/
Got a sawed off and a three-five with me nigga/
Ready to get it cracking’ come and ride with me nigga/
I’ll put some change on yo head/
Get a nigga to kill you while you laying in the bed/
And leave your brains on the floor/
Hit your safe and then do the same thing to your hoe/
Got a chip on my shoulder it’s getting heavy as hell/
All'a nigga had to do was play with my mail/
We used to be down as hell/
Snitching ass nigga sent me to the county jail/
You shouldn’a lied to me dawg/
Now I’m riding with killers that’s down to die for me dawg/
And I’ma ride with my niggas/
They Deuce and Attitude and they’ll tell you/

Aye…
Scary ass, fake ass, sucker ass nigga/
Keep on playing’ someone will find your ass in the river/
Bumping your gums got you in the middle/
Of some shit where your ass being hunted by a killer/
Yeah, we know where you stay/
Ima catch your broke ass slipping one of these days/
I’ma let loose with one of these K’s/
Your momma or your baby momma mamma ain’t safe/
I did some shopping around and found a couple grenades/
Now I’m looking for you raggedy ass Escalade/
I wish I woulda knew back in the days/
That you was a bitch ass nigga with hoe ass ways/
You shouldn’a hated on me dawg/
Fuck all that talking that shit you be saying to me dawg/
I keep it simple as that/
You looking for me on the Hill is where you’ll find me at/

HOOK

[Attitude]
Pussy ass, sucker ass, fraud ass nigga/
Running your mouth 'cause you a broad ass nigga/
I look in your face and see ho cake/
Niggas is hard to shake they stay in your way/
But I move with a smooth pace/
Give a fuck about a case, put a Glock in your face/
Until my mission complete I don’t cease/
How the fuck is you gone shit on my name in these streets/
Supplied the hustle, off of the muscle/
Got niggas on stand-by and they ready to touch you/
They ain’t fucking with your vest, it’s straight to the face/
No shells left on the scene, just a body to trace/
After he checking in they get in the wind/
How long you got left?  It really depends/
You don’t know which way to go as you struggle for breath/
That’s what motherfuckers get for not checking theyself/
