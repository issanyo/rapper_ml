[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
Now I'm in the 9th inning
Thought I fell off, ain't quite finished
Yeah, I'm about to put my foot in it, talk with it, walk with it
I'm no gimmick
2012 there'll be no games, real rap, real bars, I'm not playing
Haters y'all lame, you a Missy fan!
I'm a beast in a booth, I'm just sayin'
Yeah, I make 'em wanna get low
Duck with it, buck with it, let's go
Every time I spin around, it's a sick flow
You newcomers better sit back and take notes
Yeah, this here my time
Yeah I've come better run, take what's mine
Bite the dead off like a tick line
This rhyme gonna make 'em push rewind
Yeah I'm so hot, up on the charts, number one spot
You see me when I drop, and I won't flop
Missy never stop, got the music game on lock (yeah)
Wanna get served?
You third, you second, but I come first
I flip my verse like I flip birds
I'm fire, yes sir!

[Hook: Timbaland]

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
Now I'm in the 9th inning
Niggas think I fail when I'm still winnin
So I been gone for a hot minute
I love this shit, that's why I got a gift in it
(Yeah) Fuck nigga, get fly
Nigga can't talk wit' a gun in the mouth
Niggas bitch up, bet they run in the house
I can smell bullshit when they walk out
(Yeah) Heard that old saying, yo
Never ever cross a one day, give ya most
Never ever act funny for the white folks
I'm a big fisherman when you a tadpole
(Yeah) I like Lady Gaga
Why you let a nigga do ya whole album?
Where you think that fake producer got ya style from?
Come fuck with a nigga, watch the outcome
(Yeah) Ain't no real artists
Wack talent get in real starvin'
All you hear in music is the chorus
Well that's okay, Timmy back in the story

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
Down to the 9th inning
I'm the real deal, y'all pretending
Years later, my songs still spinning
I do record deals no less than ten milli
(Yeah) My hits be yay long
My songs go on like a marathon
Get ghost, get gone, you a dum-dum
Better rhyme here, come and bite this like a python
(Yeah) Wanna act fly?
Wanna act like you better than the M-I
Shakin 'em, bakin 'em all like a bean pie
Takin' 'em, burnin 'em down like I'm Left Eye
(Yeah) Futuristic
Y'all can pack it up, I done ripped it
When you say my name, call me Miss Bitch
I make the next chick run to the exit
(Yeah) Yeah I got a sick sense
I'm making this a movie like a Netflix
I'm on the guest list, on the checklist
I'm the flyest chick, now tell me who the best is!
(Yeah) Elliott be the name
Elliott back in the game
Elliott hit it with a bang
Bring the hook back in, Timbaland
