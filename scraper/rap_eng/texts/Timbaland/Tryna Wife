Rose in the air, Hoes in a pair
Me no here, boy don't stare
Should've have been a dope boy, wear dope gear
Nigga do something to me, he could go where
They roll wheels, I roll air
They hoes in the videos, my hoes here

Need a parade tell'em my floats here
Im no fear, Im so leer

Four levels in the house, nigga no stairs
Me no fair, rolls in the chair

All the haters (niggas) talking, me no hear

Niggas throwin ones, we throwin shares
They do nights, We do years
This be murder, with a black tear
You with Murda, bring your ass here!
