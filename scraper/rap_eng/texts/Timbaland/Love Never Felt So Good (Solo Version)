[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Baby, love never felt so good
And I'd die if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd die if it's never mine
Not like you hold me, hold me

[Pre-Chorus]
And the night's gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, I can't wait
I can't take it

[Chorus]
Cause baby, everytime I love you, in and out of my life, in out baby
Tell me, if you really love me it's in and out my life, in out baby
So baby, yes, love never felt so good
