[Intro: Young Thug]
That boy got shot, I know who didn't do it
That boy got shot, I know who didn't do it
That boy got shot, I know who didn't do it
Slime mob

[Hook: Young Thug]
That boy got shot, I know who didn't do it
That bitch got fucked, I know who didn't do it
Fuck that lil' bitch
He swear all he want, but he didn't do it
He actin' like it, but he didn't do it
He couldn't do it
Didn't do it, he didn't
No he didn't do it
All caps: he ain't do it

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Bitch you didn't do it
Boy you didn't do it, you didn't do it
Bitch I was slime
I sleep in your woods, like Nike, just do it
I'm smokin' on trees
My step is a stomp and my feet on that wood
I am on fire
This ice cools me down so don't play with no fluid
Whip out the bankroll and buy the stilettos
She not gon' do this shit unless I say so
Been a hustler, never been one to kick in a door
He should've known
Put Act on my Eggo then syrup, no Karo
We really rich, nigga, pour 4s in a Faygo
And it's fake though
If she wanna fuck on my bitch, she's a dyke hoe
That right though
Consent for our signatures, we don't do Geico
Alright hoe? Sign your life away for a little plate

[Hook: Young Thug]
That boy got shot, I know who didn't do it
That bitch got fucked, I know who didn't do it
Fuck that lil' bitch
He say what he want, but he didn't do it
He actin' like it, but he didn't do it
He didn't do it
Didn't do it
No he didn't do it
All caps: he ain't do it

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I know your worth
You know my work, I go berserk
If she ain't worth
Fuck it, nigga, still buy the lil' purse (cash!)
I see you ballin'
You do it small: Nerf
I throw them bands
Later on best believe she gon' slurp
Chicken pox, gators look like they got chicken pox
I can't flop cause I'm higher than an angel was
Bend her back, eat it, then perform that ankle lock
Niggas can't get the bitch, the girl, they know they crop
First I'm gunnin' then I started runnin'
She flooded me with pussy then I started cummin'
No game, I made that pussy nigga run like Sonic (take off)
When he looked at Pablo Esco then I thought 'bought bummin'

[Hook: Young Thug]
That boy got shot, I know who didn't do it
That bitch got fucked, I know who didn't do it
Fuck that lil' bitch
He say what he want, but he didn't do it
He actin' like it, but he didn't do it
He didn't do it
Didn't do it
No he didn't do it
All caps: he ain't do it
