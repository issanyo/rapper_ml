[Verse 1]
You are the road that i will travel
You are the words i write
You are the ocean i will swallow
You are the wind i ride
You are the cause to keep my head up high
I will survive
You gotta know i'll stay beside you
Right till the day i die

[Chorus]
I don't want to change anymore
I've already paid
(Said, i've already paid)
I don't have to pray anymore
Because my soul has been saved
And now
Whenever i come, whenever i go
No, you're never far away, far away
Whenever i come, whenever i go
No you're never far away, far away
Never far away

[Verse 2]
You're the blood that's in my veins
You're my second skin, skin
I'm a feather on the wind
You will bring me in
Every heart should have a beat
Every night a dream
Every king should have a queen
Every saint a sin

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
[When i go hot you make sure i don't break
Gimme life inside of heaven's gates, i know
(Heaven, heaven)
You taught me how to live like [unverified]
Gave me definition for the worst i know
That there ain't no space between you and me

[Chorus]
