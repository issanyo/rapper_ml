[Intro]
Come on

[Verse 1]
She's real cute, but she ain't got nothin' on me, boy
Caught you with her, now I'm gonna scratch up all your toys
I'm not done yet, watch what I do with all your clothes
You can hide behind the telephone now
But you're gonna get it for sure

[Chorus]
I'ma get him when I see him (In person)
I'ma hurt him when I see him (In person)
I'ma kick him when I see him (In person)
Can't wait till I see him (In person)
I'ma get him when I see him (In person)
I'ma hurt him when I see him (In person)
Better never let me see him (In person)
I'ma get him, I'ma get him

[Post-Chorus]
Come on, girls
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing it, girls
Come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Run to your mama and don't come back
You better stay in her house
Good sense would have told you not to let me out by now
Keep your money, you're gonna need all the help you can get
How you're gonna explain to your boys
How you got beat up by a chick?

[Chorus]
I'ma get him when I see him (In person)
I'ma hurt him when I see him (In person)
I'ma kick him when I see him (In person)
Can't wait till I see him (In person)
I'ma get him when I see him (In person)
I'ma hurt him when I see him (In person)
Better never let me see him (In person)
I'ma get him, I'ma get him

[Post-Chorus]
Come on, dolls
See, 'round here
We don't do things nice and easy
Nah, we do things rough
Yeah, sing it girls
They don't know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Hope you hear me, boy
I won't take that, not like that, no, no
Train that boy now
What's wrong with that boy?
I should have trained him before I played him, yeah
What the hell's wrong with that boy?
Sing it, girls
If you want that boy
You gotta train 'em before you play 'em
That's right, that's what I'm talking about
Y'all hear me out there?
I said if you want that boy
You gotta train 'em before you play 'em

[Chorus]
I'ma get him when I see him (In person)
I'ma hurt him when I see him (In person)
I'ma kick him when I see him (In person)
Can't wait till I see him (In person)
I'ma get him when I see him (In person)
I'ma hurt him when I see him (In person)
Better never let me see him (In person)
I'ma get him, I'ma get him

[Outro]
Come on Timbo, they ain't ready for this, baby
