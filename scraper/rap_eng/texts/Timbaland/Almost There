[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm come from a small town where organized crime is the rule
You kill niggas without permission, niggas gon' kill you
We bang the rags too, red and blue
This shit ain't out only there on the west side fool
Surrounded by section eight houses in the projects
A place where you make the wrong turn, you get robbed next
We all targets, standin' out on the street corner
That's why you see the lil' kids with the heat on 'em
Police pull out, hop out but they can't catch us
They never even get a chance to say "Drop your weapons"
Liquor stores never close, the whole hood high
Niggas know when it's war the whole hood ride
We on that Bishop in Juice shit
I put this fo'-five in yo' mouth like a toothpick, you bitch
The south ain't safe no mo' so get a gun
And pray to God you make it to see twenty-one
You gon' make me crawl through your backyard and cut off your light switch
Kick in your back door and take all that white shit
Niggas know what to do when I'm around
Go put your pack up and pick up your fo' pound

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Look at here, ain't nobody 'round here scared
I'm headin' for the top and I'm almost there
Oh yeeuh, this shiny shit right here
I'll work magic and make you niggas disappear

Look at here, ain't nobody 'round here scared
I'm headin' for the top and I'm almost there
Oh yeeuh, this shiny shit right here
I'll work magic and make you niggas disappear

[Verse 2: Yung Joc]
It's just another day at the coffee shop
We sellin everything, down to the shoes and watch
And for the right price meet me in the parking lot
I got a sale on them old school Chevy drops
No knock cause we only serve the best
Oh yeah my coffee shop is cheaper than the rest~!
I'm takin orders, tell me who's next
Only cash, no credit, no checks
When your car stop, welcome to Starblocks
You wanna triple your knot? Invest in our stock
And now we doin numbers, just like the close-out
Make sure to shop with me, before it's sold out
Everybody on the block know my nickname
Grade A pimp game, you can call me Ben Frank
And all my money get counted when the shifts change
Then get 211 t-shirt wit'cho picture framed

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Look at here, ain't nobody 'round here scared
I'm headin' for the top and I'm almost there
Oh yeeuh, this shiny shit right here
I'll work magic and make you niggas disappear

Look at here, ain't nobody 'round here scared
I'm headin' for the top and I'm almost there
Oh yeeuh, this shiny shit right here
I'll work magic and make you niggas disappear

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Ayo the dopes and the rice, the cokes and the pyrex
Over the stove and I'm bout to hit it with the ice
Runners love to pump the bomb
Ain't no more fair ones, now niggas'll jump your moms
The god, minus the 12 disciples
I pop up, all you see is shells and rifles
If I don't like you, I'mma kill you not fight you
I bite a little piece of your ear off like Mike do
And everybody gon' follow me now
Down eighth and an oozie mahogany brown
Faggots want you to kill 'em in a hurry
It fucks me up, like they ain't got no money to get buried
You could flip, I'll survive m'kay, motherfucker
In my block still doin twenty-five a day
Know you work out, chest and your back all nice
But the twelve gauge'll have your six pack on ice, what
Sinnin or not, I'm grinnin a lot, spendin a knot
Dirty denim and a cinnamon fox
Bitches'll follow, gangsters'll ride, gentlemen watch
Buy the bar, leave drunk, shoot up the block

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Look at here, ain't nobody 'round here scared
I'm headin' for the top and I'm almost there
Oh yeeuh, this shiny shit right here
I'll work magic and make you niggas disappear
