Uh
Uhh
I don't think they ready for this
Another Timbaland master piece
Uh
I dont think they ready

Verse 1: Timbaland

Uh, Timbaland the funky beat maka
I can rock the U.S. and all of Jamaica
I can make you dance, and shake your butt, and wiggle
When it's hot outside I eat popsicles
Check it, do you want to get freaky tonight?
I'm throwin a house party and the stars at night
All the ladies gonna be there in they tight skirts
I'm gonna mingle a little and start to flirt
Baby, don't get an attitude
Or I have to throw your silly ass in the pool
I ain't got no time for the silly game
Timb and Maganoo, I got all the game

Chorus:

Now that you are peepin my style
My kind of style
That make you buck wild
Throw your hands up in the sky
Pass me something so we all get high
Now that you are peepin my style
My kind of style
That make you buck wild
Throw your hands up in the sky
Pass me something so we all get high

Verse 2: Timbaland

Check it, let's take it to another level
One of my fantasies, it is love in pebble
I want to take her on a cruise around the block
And make her say "Don't stop the body rock"
I want to take her on a cruise around the block
And make her say "Don't stop the body rock"
I want to take her on a cruise around the block
And make her say "Don't stop the body rock"
Check it, now I'm back to my basic rhythme
Check out ill ass flow I'm about to give him
I'm a make him dance and make em shake they ass
But not to slow and not to fast
Timbaland ain't got nuthin to prove
I done did five years and pay my due
I got my mine Big E and Big Rodney
Coming strong like the freaky freaky freaky on me
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But I got baking me some of that good french toast
Let me take it to another level, I'm the host
As I can get freaky, fre-freaky-fre-freaky
Ooooooh

Chorus 2X

Know what I'm sayin
Now I got to be out
Two verses
The first verse repeats itself
Now dat, now dat you are peepin my style
