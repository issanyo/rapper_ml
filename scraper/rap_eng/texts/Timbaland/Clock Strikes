[Magoo]
See, them other crews could not figure me
It's the Mag and double-ooh, got that fat CD
Buck a crystal, hit a nigga with my blunt Philly
Fake MC's getting gassed like they eatin chili
Only way they seem to rap is if they got a Philly
Maybe I'm Nicole Brown, cause you really kill me
Got away with hittin me, but you ain't O.J
I'm bout to shake up the world like Cassius Clay
When I bumble watch your back cause I sting like bee
This ain't the Wild Wild West and you ain't Kool Moe Dee
Watch a movie now you think that you really Joe Pesci
You don't want beef with me, like a diaper I'm messy

[Timbaland]
I'm that laid back brother they call Timbaland
I drive a 850 sometimes a 3-2 Mazda van
You can catch me standin in my b-boy stance
Or catch me at home watching 'Who's the Man'?
They call Robert, cause I pack much heat
Or call me now, because they dig the way I speaks
I'm like a genie, because I've been trapped in a bottle
I've got more stunts, than that nigga Desperado
Come follow, a mad brother with ?*unintelligible*?
Tomorrow, you be sayin, when can we meet? Uhh uhh
My offices hours are nine to five
Ain't that right Maganoo, Maganoo? Right... right

Chorus: Magoo

When the clock strikes, half past two, yeah
They'll be dancin, through the night
Da-da-da, da, da (HEY!)
Da-da-da, da, da (AHH!)
Da-da-da, da, da (HEY!)
Da da daahhhhhh! (AHH!)
(repeat with hey's and ahh's added in regularly throughout)

[Timbaland]
Now gimme that...(Boom boom vroom vroom)
And run with the... (AHH)
Party people are you ready for Tim and Maganoo
As we come, rum & coke, won't you kick a verse too

[Magoo]
Yo I'm bout to get it started like I'm Hammer, then I farted
You retarded if you thinkin Brandy really broken hearted
I departed doin dirt, looking up your girl's skirt
Keep it Steve Martin style, bustin loose like jerk
I get Up like -town, gimme don't say no more
Got them scars on my face cause my health be poor
You Milli Vanilli, I'm Kurtis Blow like eighty-fo'
No I don't want your girl she be suckin my big toe
You get death like row, I take a beanie then I jet
Peace to 2Pac, cause he was dope as it get
Twisted but you ain't Keith Sweat and shit got hot
Make a block then make a circle then I rock that spot
The rap phenom, I make a dyke go straight
If you think I'm cute, then you up too late
Make no mistake, I'm a question with no answer
Riddle me like the Joker get burnt like JoJo dancer

Chorus 2X

(hey's and ahh's continue for a bit without Magoo)
