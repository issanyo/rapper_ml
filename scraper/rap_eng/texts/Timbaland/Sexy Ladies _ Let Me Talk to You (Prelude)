[Part I: Sexy Ladies]

[Intro: Timbaland]
C'mon

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I can tell you want it good, girl
You ain't gotta worry no more
You keep my bottles cold and you pop 'em
As soon as I walk in the door
These dudes don't know me from Adam and Eve
That's why they can't mess up my flow
And when this beat drops, your heart stops
You feel it from your head to your toes

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
If you know what I'm talking 'bout (Hey)
Let me see you work it out (Hey, girl)
Girl, that's what I'm talking 'bout (Come on, Justin, talk to 'em)

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talkin' to one of the greatest who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest, just lettin' you know
That I got sexy ladies, so back up some more
And let me take it off

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
I know a little girly from uptown
Just waiting just to cater to me
I know a little betty from downtown
That'll do anything that I please
All my other people that dance 'round
When they hear me rockin' the groove
Now it might sound cocky
But is it really cocky if you know that it's true?

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
If you know what I'm talking 'bout (Hey, girl)
Let me see you work it out (Hey, girl)
Girl, that's what I'm talking 'bout (Come on, Justin, talk to 'em)

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talkin' to one of the greatest who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest, just lettin' you know
That I got sexy ladies, so back up some more
And let me take it off

[Bridge: Timbaland]
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body

[Breakdown: Justin Timberlake]
Now break it down
Now move a little bit to the left
Now move back over here to the right
Now let me see you walk, walk, yeah
Now let me see you walk
Here comes your part, girl

[Bridge: Timbaland & Justin Timberlake]
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body (Slow down, girl)
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body (Slow down, girl)
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body (Slow down, girl)
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talkin' to one of the greatest who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest, just lettin' you know
That I got sexy ladies, so back up some more
And let me take it off

[Part II: Let Me Talk To You (Prelude)]

[Intro: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
(I'm tired of arguing, girl)
Hey, hey, hey
(I'm tired of arguing, girl)
Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
My love, uh huh, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love
My love

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I love the way you're standing
Lips look so sweet, like cotton candy (My love)
That don't mean you gotta stop dancin'
'Cause the way that you move is so demandin' (My love)
Let's put it on cruise control
Let me take you to the crib, let me ease your soul (My love)
I'm gonna take it nice and slow
But first let me, let me, let me talk to her

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love
My love

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
Walk into my great place, cozy
I'm glad you came, let's make a toast (My love)
Let me make an indecent proposal
Let me take you to the back and do what we suppose to (My love)
Let's take a trip to Dubai
You can be the investigator, I'm your private eye (My love)
You know I want a piece of that pie
But first let me, let me, let me talk to her

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
