[Intro]
(King stays King Baby)

[Verse 1: Obsessed]
You know you did me wrong
Did me wrong, you did
But I bet you you didn’t know it would end like this
You messed around and acted out like me and you were perfect
Don't you give your time unless is someone more deserving
Well I just gotta know was it  worth it
Tell me, tell me, was it worth
Cause now the grass is greener growing on this side
Really living life on this side
Every city, every night on this side
This side...
You hated on me then but you checking for me now
Wouldn’t say my name and now they screaming in the crowd
Could’ve had it all but you rather be playing
I’m just saying
That’s the thing about them tables, tables, they turn
They turn
Gotta be careful, because them tables, tables, they turn
They turn
You hated me then but you checking for me now
They turn, they turn they turn
Wouldn’t say my name and now they screaming in the crowd
They turn, they turn they turn
Remember those nights, we would drive through the city
I would tell you about my dreams I’ll be listening in a jizzy
But you just blow me off, blow me off,  like its nothing
Small town girl that turn that nothing into something
I just got to know why you hurting
Tell me, tell me
Are you hurting
Cause now the grass is greener growing on this side
Really living life on this side
Every city, every night on this side
This side
You hated on me then but you checking for me now
They turn, they turn they turn
Wouldn’t say my name and now they screaming in the crowd
They turn, they turn they turn
Could’ve had it all but you rather be playing
I’m just saying

[Chorus]
That’s the thing about them tables, tables, they turn
They turn
Gotta be careful, because them tables, tables, they turn
You hated me then but you checking for me now
They turn, they turn they turn
Wouldn’t say my name and now they screaming in the crowd
They turn, they turn, they turn

[Verse 2: Tink]
I had some higher expectations for you
Thought that we would make it there
Gave you all I had
And all you had to do was show you care
But that ain’t even half of it
You played me like a game of chess
You told me you would hold it down
And left me up me with no regrets
Late nights, late nights
Do get lonely
Especially when I needed you there just so you could console me
And now you got to pay for that
It’s clear that I don’t need you back
Tables turning clockwise
I ain't got no time for it
You never saw potential in my vision
Told you 50/50 cause I thought you was committed
Guess not
Bad shot
Didn’t stop
Kept it moving
Say you don’t know what you got until one day you up and lose it

[Chorus]
That’s the thing about them tables, tables, they turn
They turn
Gotta be careful, because them tables, tables, they turn
You hated on me then but you checking for me now
They turn, they turn they turn
Wouldn’t say my name and now they screaming in the crowd
They turn, they turn, they turn
Turn, turn, turn
