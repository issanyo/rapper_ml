[Intro]
She got me so good right now
I'm feeling so good right now
I can give you what you want baby
I'mma even let you take it all baby

[Verse 1]
I waited my turn, I put in that work
I buried these niggas, put them in the dirt
I run the Empire, the power is mine
Take over the game, I put that on my mom
You ain't wasting my time, ain't wasting my time is wasting my money
Got back on my grind, do this on my own, they know I got work in
Know I'mma shine, I hear ya hidden agendas, I'm praying this shit'll offend ya
They all got they hands to the ceiling cause I got that work

[Hook]
Got that work, get employed
If you want that loud, I can bring the noise
They need 3D vision just to see ya boy
Brand new foreign car, you should see my toy
Work, got that work, work, got that work
Work, got that work, work, she like work
Work, got that work, work, got that work
Work, got that work, work, she like work

[Verse 2]
I got this rap from my mother
I put that on my brothers
Catch me out with your lady
I'm in that foreign, no other
Ain't gotta talk about cash, let it rain, it's covered
She just wanna drink and fuck, I told her we are not lovers
For the love of this money, I probably hurt your own family
Got that work, work, work, I know that he understanding me
Any rapper you can find, I bet you he is a fan of me
Claiming he got that crown, I put that in the hands of me
Cause they call me the greatest, I shit on the haters
Going way up, Going way up like elevators
I'm higher than y'all, flier than y'all, call me sire
Can you do this? Can you do that? Don't like liars

[Hook]
Got that work, get employed
If you want that loud, I can bring the noise
They need 3D vision just to see ya boy
Brand new foreign car, you should see my toy
Work, got that work, work, got that work
Work, got that work, work, she like work
Work, got that work, work, got that work
Work, got that work, work, she like work

[Bridge]
Know I put in work, know I put in work
Shawty go berserk, shawty go berserk
Know I put in work, know I put in work
Half bro hating on worth
I did that
They hate on
I got that
They hate on but she know

[Hook]
Got that work, get employed
If you want that loud, I can bring the noise
They need 3D vision just to see ya boy
Brand new foreign car, you should see my toy
Work, got that work, work, got that work
Work, got that work, work, she like work
Work, got that work, work, got that work
Work, got that work, work, she like work
