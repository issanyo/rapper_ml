[Hook]
Make me glow glow glow glow
How far can you go?
Make me glow glow glow glow
How far can you go?
Make me glow glow glow glow
Only you know how to make me
Glow glow glow glow
I wanna go and go and go and go

[Verse 1]
People say I've gone crazy (Cause I'm around you)
That I'm not the same lady (Cause I'm around you)
People say my eyes are hazy (Cause I'm around you)
People say I'm acting shady (When I am around you)
But I'd rather be your baby
Than sit around and do the same things (same things)
I am, getting something out of it
I'm indebted to your good shit
And I could never get enough

[Hook]
Make me glow glow glow glow
How far can you go?
Make me glow glow glow glow
How far can you go?
You make me glow glow glow glow
Only you know how to make me
Glow glow glow glow
I wanna go and go and go and go

[Verse 2]
I don't where I am
And I don't know what you did
But I think that I may float away
I don't know what happened
And I don't know where we went
But I think that I may die today
There's everybody else and then there's you
Baby why you gotta be so good
And tonight you're on fire (so come around me)
I'm gonna never get tired

[Hook]
Make me glow glow glow glow
How far can you go?
Make me glow glow glow glow
How far can you go?
You make me glow glow glow glow
Only you know how to make me
Glow glow glow glow
I wanna go and go and go and go

[Bridge]
I don't gotta tell you what to do 'cause you're on it
I don't gotta let you in my world 'cause you rock it
I don't gotta tell you what to do 'cause you're on it
I don't gotta let you in my world 'cause you rock it
You rock it, you rock it, you rock it

[Hook]
Make me glow glow glow glow
How far can you go?
Make me glow glow glow glow
How far can you go?
You make me glow glow glow glow
Only you know how to make me
Glow glow glow glow
I wanna go and go and go and go
