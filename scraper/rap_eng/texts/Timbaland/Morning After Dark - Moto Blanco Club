Go Timbo

I'll be the same when it all goes up, I'll be the same when it all goes down
Not the first one open it up, I'll be the last one closing it out
Don't know if I'll give you a shot yet, Lil Mama, I'm peeping your style
Do I think you're dope enough? Yup, one way of finding it out

The way you came at me, boo, don't care, not afraid, I'm like wild
Really want it from head to toe, question if she gon' let it out
Anyway the hour glass go, I don't worry anyhow
Why don't we see where it go? Let's figure it out

When the cats come out the bats come out to play, yeah
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
In the morning after

When the cats come out the bats come out to play, yeah
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
In the morning after dark

Come on, SoShy

I got a little secret for ya, I never sleep when comes the night
But every time I smack my fingers I switch back into the light
My moon belongs to your sun, your fire is burning my mind
Is it love or is it lust? Something that I just can't describe

Am I the one and only? 'Cause you're the only one
It felt so long and lonely, waiting for you to come
It's looking bright and early, I'm willing to close my eyes
This is the unusual story, Timbo and SoShy

When the cats come out the bats come out to play, yeah
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
In the morning after

When the cats come out the bats come out to play, yeah
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
In the morning after dark

Go Nelly

I need some REM but I don't like sleeping alone
So come and pick me up as soon as you put down the phone
I wanna get into trouble, later you'll carry me home
I wanna go undercover, I just wanna rattle your bones

Yes, I'm the one and only but I'm not the only one
So let's work overtime on this shift, it ends with the sun
Maybe we can start a riot, maybe we can run this town
Maybe I'll be your vampire, we could figure it out

When the cats come out the bats come out to play, yeah
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
In the morning after

When the cats come out the bats come out to play, yeah
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
In the morning after dark

Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, in the morning after dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, in the morning after dark
Please don't leave me, girl, in the morning after dark
Please don't leave me, girl, in the morning after dark
Please don't leave me, girl

When the cats come out the bats come out to play
When the cats come out the bats come out to play
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way

When the cats come out the bats come out to play
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way
