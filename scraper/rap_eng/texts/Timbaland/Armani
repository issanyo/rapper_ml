Armani, Armani
I keep a cray sem' on my hip like I'm Ronnie
Breezed up in Philly
I'm in my Ace, I'll be surprised if you spot me
You just need a splash in the game
Well guess what I just made a tsunami(uh)
Givenchy, Armani
You look at my swag and you can't even copy
Used to ride in a Honda
Transformed to a 550, feelin' like Optimus
I'm killin' these shows
Left and right ain't nobody stoppin' us uh
My city, they love me
My family party all night to my accomplishments
Now I'm performin' with daddy
And I got your girl in the cold, in line for it
Armani, Armani
They said they gon' rob us but when they gon' do it?
Sneaks are Armani
My women Italian, I just left my new chick uh
People is talkin'
Like "Who is this lion and where is his music?"
My dad been tourin' the world
I moved in the booth, my friends I was losin'

Think you must be out your mind
Soon as I wake up I only focus on them dollar signs
I ain't on the corner but I hustle, gettin' major rich
On Instagram I see y'all hatin' on me, talkin' major ish
