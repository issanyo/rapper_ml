[Verse 1]
I walk alone inside these walls and it's not easy being me
It seems like every time I escape, there's another following
Being prone and, yeah, they're coming
I can feel them shooting me, without asking
Lights are flashing, but I guess that

[Chorus]
It's what I've become, let me live as who I am
Never wanted nothing, but you don't let me breathe as who I am
I've just begun, I've just begun, I've just begun to find my way
I've just begun, I've just begun, I've just begun to find my way

[Verse 2]
In the chase, I know I’m wanted
Hey look, I’m no victim
It’d be nice to make some mistakes without observations
Or opinions of distortions
Deceiving what you’re believing
It’s a shame that all these blessings can be a curse

[Chorus]
It's what I've become, let me live as who I am
Never wanted nothing, but you don't let me breathe as who I am
I've just begun, I've just begun, I've just begun to find my way
I've just begun, I've just begun, I've just begun to find my way

[Bridge]
There's not a pill to take to save me from this heartache
But I have no regrets, I'm hoping for a better day
There's not a pill to take to save me from this heartache
But I have no regrets, I'm hoping for a better day

[Chorus]
It's what I've become, let me live as who I am
Never wanted nothing, but you don't let me breathe as who I am
It's what I've become, let me live as who I am
Never wanted nothing, but you don't let me breathe as who I am

[Outro]
I've just begun, I've just begun
I've just begun to find my way
I've just begun, I've just begun
I've just begun to find my way
