[Verse]
What would you do to get to me?
What would you say to have your way?
Would you give up or try again
If I hesitate to let you win?
Would you be yourself or play your role?
Tell all the boys to keep it low?
If I say no, would you turn away?
Or play me off or would you stay?

[Chorus]
If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
If at first you don't succeed
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again, oh

[Rap verse]

[Chorus]
If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
If at first you don't succeed
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again, oh

[Hook]
See, you don't wanna throw it all away
Might be shy on the first date
What about the next date?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
See, you don't wanna throw it all away
Might be buggin' on the first date
But what about the next date?
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
If at first you don't succeed
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
No, no, no, no
