Uh uh
Hey baby how you
Why yo face lookin' all sad and blue
Don't you like the Navigator truck that I brought you
Why you trying to act a fool
Don't try to say you seen me talking to your girlfriends
Ask Tonya and Shirl then
Gimme a place and time when
Don't try to accuse me of silly stuff that I'm doing on the streets
You gotta remember, without you, there's no me
I'm just an average man
Tryin' to make it in this cold world
Tell me baby, why you trippin', girl

I don't want to fuss with you
So I'm gonna sit out on the couch
Don't try to talk to me
'cause boy I am blocking you out
I don't want to hear a thing
Nothing you got to say
You should think twice
About the way you've been talking to me

[Chorus]
Pack yo bags
Get on the bus
Ain't got no time (for)
Talkin' all yo stuff
Need to pack my stuff
Since this's what you want
I don't really care
There's no more
Go catch a cab or
Get on the bus
I ain't got no time for
You talkin' all that junk
Better get my stuff
Since this is what you want
I don't really care

I ain't got no words for you
So you can stop callin' my friends
Tellin' them it wasn't your fault
And why I ain't lettin' you in
Too many times before
I let you back in my life
But this is a new day
And this won't go down tonight

[Chorus]
Mm, mm (da-da-duh-da-da)
Mm, mm (who)
Mm, mm
Mm, mm {say what}

Introduce you to Dolce and Gervana
Advance you from dirt bikes to Hondas
Took you from that terrible stress
Now you telling me that I am a bother
What kind of mess is that
To tell a man who put you on his team
That's just like killing a dream
(No no baby) That's how it seems
I worked hard to build up what I had for you
I pray to God, that there's not another man between me and you
So just tell me
There's no need to lie for
While you sleepin' with your eyes closed
Do you want to talk, aight yo

[Chorus: x2]
