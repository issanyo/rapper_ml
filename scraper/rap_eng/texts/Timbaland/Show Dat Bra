[Verse 1 - Attitude]
Yeah, she exotic, she got class and a lot of ass
It's hypnotic the smell of Kush and a lot of Cash
If we could blow it all, baby help me throw it all
Yeah, you can bring your friends, I'mma get to know em all
I ain't talking code but I'm trying to try em all
Looking for the right fit like I'm in the mall
Like you little cutey with the long hair
Oh she your best friend cool you can both share
Me and Timbaland got a ?? the club packed
Say little momma you got it all, I love that!
Don't go falling in love, baby I'm a baller
Hit it from the back on the floor, you're my rug rat
Then she taking a shot up on the ?? I done had four
You got a couple friends with you, I wish you had more!
Cause once I reel em in get em in my condo
I make that ass come can't let that ass go

[Chorus]
Blow up that cash, put up that glass
Baby I know you're hot
But show dat bra!
With that plan let's have a lot of fun
Cause your boy, he knows how to ball
Don't worry about your Gucci, you gonna take it off
Don't worry about your Louis, you gonna take it off
I'mma get you girls a cab
You get in my car cause I'm gonna do all y'all!

[Verse 2 - Bran'Nu]
I ain't trying to get in your car and party hard
I'm a star, let's get it straight before you start it off!
Hands off, till you give me the keys to the loft
And put a ring on it before I take it off!
This ain't a game I've been the boss
And now for keeping it popping just like my lip gloss
I'm here to floss, I'm here to set it off
And I'll be having you up and down like a seesaw
And what I rock, ain't all I got
And I don't really care what you got unless you got a yacht
Then step it up a notch you better hit the spot
And make me so hot as if I'm taking shots
And I'm the cream of the mutherfucking crop
If you can catch me in the top slot slot
You might see me in the Bentley drop top
With Southern Caly as my backdrop

[Chorus]
Blow up that cash, put up that glass
Baby I know you're hot
But show dat bra!
With that plan let's have a lot of fun
Cause your boy, he knows how to ball
Don't worry about your Gucci, you gonna take it off
Don't worry about your Louis, you gonna take it off
I'mma get you girls a cab
You get in my car cause I'm gonna do all y'all!

[Verse 3 - Timbaland]
She anticipating, she want it, and she want it bad
I'm contemplating how to make it happen quick and fast
Timbaland don't worry now, I know you heard my song
And so tonight is going down, I'm trying to see your thongs
Lil momma nice and thick and she know that I'm the shit
She knows that when the club close out who she coming with
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
All o yall can fit in its a Mayback baby
Layback all o yall can get it!
I'm a freak hoping that you a freak too
Well girl this ain't enough I need to
Take off that Gucci and the Louis, no you're not a groupie
But do me like you know me tape it, we can make a movie!
I know you like it, don't you? She need a bodyguard
She look delicious, everybody part I lick hard!
Hey listen baby, I ain't trying to break nobody heart
But it's the end of the night thats when the party start

[Chorus]
Blow up that cash, put up that glass
Baby I know you're hot
But show dat bra!
With that plan let's have a lot of fun
Cause your boy, he knows how to ball
Don't worry about your Gucci, you gonna take it off
Don't worry about your Louis, you gonna take it off
I'mma get you girls a cab
You get in my car cause I'm gonna do all y'all!
