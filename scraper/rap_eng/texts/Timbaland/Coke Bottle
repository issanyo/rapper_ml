[Verse 1 : AGNEZ MO]
I got dollarz, could you imagine
You're givin' love to an independent woman
Iâ€™m VIP so they can't see me
I'll be like dang, another tryna hit on me

But I just doin', ah! me don't care about 'em
It's like I'm on the cloud, me don't care bout 'em (Damn)
I got it from my Mama, I thank her everyday
Everyday they keep they eyes on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah ah ah ah I gotta 'em made
He know dat, he know dat
He prolly has no chance
But he keeps lookin' lookin' lookin' for that day
That he can get a little try (ge-ge-get a little try)

[Chorus]
I see you lookin' at my curves, coke bottle
I see you lookin' at my curves, coke bottle
I got dat bounce, I'm bouncin', pluck me like a rubber band
I got dat bounce, I'm bouncin', pluck me like a rubber band

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
Can you pop it like a rubber band on the tip of me
Can you drop it to the floor then bring it back to me
No man in the world, got a bop like Timothy
Her curves make me go crazy
That's why this beat is insane
Her coke bottle shape
Yeah it's screamin' my name
But wait, wait, she said she got a man
The way she move it, move it, move it
Got me in a trance
I gotta, I gotta tell her that I'm a fan
Yes sir!

[Verse 3: AGNEZ MO]
Fast car, you never catch me
He lookin' hard
He need a neck brace
Is it cuz everythin' I wear is official ANYE on me
Get away! (No no, don't touch me)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah ah ah ah I gotta 'em made
He know dat, he know dat
He prolly has no chance
But he keeps lookin' lookin' lookin' for that day
That he can get a little try (ge-ge-get a little try)

[Chorus]
I see you lookin' at my curves, coke bottle
I see you lookin' at my curves, coke bottle
I got dat bounce, I'm bouncin', pluck me like a rubber band
I got dat bounce, I'm bouncin', pluck me like a rubber band

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Yeah, okay you can straight pop that shit for me
I let the rubbaband pop on fifty G
Knee Haw Raw can't get it from me
Bring the fifty G wit ya
Ain't shit for free
OK I drop my top west side fool
Chrome wheel paint clean ridin' through
Have any chick I decide to
But none of them out here fine as you
K-I-N-G, you better ask somebody
Pullin that chevy you don't know nuttin bout it
Got a 44 let it go get up outtie
Better ask Timbo he know I'm bout it
Well what you lookin' at my mind ya bidness cuz
Rap bout me, I hear ya girl
And we can go an ask her what's the difference in us
She say you shy circum
I'm puttin' it inna world

[Chorus]
I see you lookin' at my curves, coke bottle
I see you lookin' at my curves, coke bottle
I got dat bounce, I'm bouncin', pluck me like a rubber band
I got dat bounce, I'm bouncin', pluck me like a rubber band

[Outro : AGNEZ MO]
Imma get it real good, make it go back and forth
Imma get it real good, make it go side to side
Imma get it real good, make it go back and forth
Imma get it real good, make it go side to side
Imma get it real good, make it go back and forth
Imma get it real good, make it go side to side
Imma get it real good, make it go back and forth
Imma get it real good, make it go side to side
