[Verse 1]
I know you've been thinking
I'm living high here without you
But no, I've been low
Truth is I'm not doing so well
Trust me I've been thinking ‘bout
Nothing else other than you
No, I don't go with nobody else

When I get down to the bottom
And still I keep on falling
I don't just love you, if I couldn't i'd go crazy
Nothing's gonna change me
You don't have to worry
Just let’s not get old saying only

[Chorus]
If we were younger
If we were stronger
'Cause we either wait on our fate
Or we don't take the same any longer
Any longer
Like we were younger
Like we were younger

[Verse 2]
We could be just getting by
We could be playing with fire
But oh, this I know
We are good together
We're all gonna make mistakes
We're all gonna have risk to take
But oh, if we don't
Nothing gets better

I guess that what I'm saying
Is even if it breaks me
I don't just love you
If I couldn't I'd go crazy
You don't have to worry
Nothing's gonna change me
Just let's not get old saying only

[Chorus]
If we were younger
If we were stronger
'Cause we either wait on our fate
Or we don't take the same any longer
Any longer
Like we were younger

If were stronger
'Cause we either wait on our fate
Or we don't take the same any longer
Like we were younger
Like we were younger
Like we were younger

If were stronger
'Cause we either wait on our fate
Or we don't take the same any longer
Any longer
Like we were younger
