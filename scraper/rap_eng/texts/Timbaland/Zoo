(Verse 1)
We step up the club is flooded
All of a sudden it's a herd
Chickens be talkin' i keep walkin'
They're just a flock of birds
Players and gators gorillas
Holding up the walls (ooh-ooh)
Half past two it's a zoo (ooh)

I'm sippin' and slippin' on my Pinot
But i know what he wants
Two steps ahead of ya
Predator he's out on the hunt
Lookin' Like Bambi I'm candy
And he want a taste (ooh-ooh)
Half past two it's a zoo (ooh)

(Chorus)
Look at all these animals in here
Movin' like some wild and crazy bandits
Party people up in a panic
So gone they on automatic

Look at all these animals in here
Movin' like some wild and crazy bandits
You're lookin' for a mate we'll find you a boo
You just might see one in this zoo

Zoo zoo zoo
Animals on the loose (loose loose)
We get up like it's a zoo (zoo zoo)
Animals on the loose (loose loose)
It's like we up in the zoo
Zoo-oo-oo-oo

(Verse 2)
Strut like a pony on it
Thoroughbred in here with a flawless mane
Wandering like crazy hit me baby
I'm wild and I can't be tamed
Eagle eye I spot him
I got him I don't have to chase (ooh-ooh)
Half past two it's a zoo (ooh)

He picks up my fragrance he goes crazy
He scoops me like Tarzan
We hit the floor while we proceeded
To do our mating dance
Heated we needed back up
And you getting in the way (ooh-ooh)
Half past two it's a zoo (ooh)

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
You can't expect for me to just sit right here
And keep it together babe (keep it together babe eeh-eh-eeh)
The animal in me it won't let me be alone and everything
Is about to drive me crazy (is about to drive me crazy eeh-eh-eeh)

(x2)
I just can't take anymore
I think i'm losing control
Feel like letting it go
Giving in to my instincts

(Chorus)
