I remember how I felt when we first met
Desire to know
How could I make the first step
The shortest way to go
And it didn't take more than a kiss
To seal the deat
Girl you're still as
Pretty as the first day
That we first met
If not more

Everything you do
Got me wanting more and more
Something about you
Really turns me on
And the way you smile
Really drives me wild
Stay for a while

Coz
Everything about you so beautiful
Baby don't no one compare to you
Coz
Everything about you so beautiful
I want you close to me coz
You know that you're irreplacable
Girl there's no MP, without u
Girl no MP without u
Girl there's no MP without u
Girl no MP without u

Some people search
For a whole lifetime
And they still can't find
That special someone that
Still there and
Got your back
And when it all falls down
They'll still be around
To catch you when you fall
And that's why I got you
You
And you got me
Me

And I'm in love everything
Everything you do
Got me wanting more and more
Something about you
Really turns me on
Ant the way you smile
Really drives me wild
Stay for a while

Refrain x2

MP ho I like that
