[Missy]
I was in love
And that's what it was
When I met you
In love
And no one could ever
Talk 'bout you
But it sucks
So many lies and
Alibis in
Our love
(yeah, mmm, uh, so I, mmm)

[Destiny's Child & Gina Thompson]
Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you
Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you

[Beyonce]
So in love
I just didn't see the
Wrong you did
In love
But now that I know
I can admit
It was love
That made me a fool
A silly fool
In love
Oh, crazy

[Destiny's Child & Gina Thompson]
Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you
Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you

[Missy]
You was always in my face
All the time
Even with 20/20 vision
I couldn't see you lie
You was always in my face
All the time
Even with 20/20 vision
I couldn't see you lie

[Destiny's Child & Gina Thompson]
Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you
Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you

[Destiny's Child & Gina Thompson]
Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you
Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you
