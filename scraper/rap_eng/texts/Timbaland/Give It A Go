This is the final moment, can't let them lock me down
I'm ready and I know it, I gotta make it count
This time may never come again
And I'ma fight, I'm going for the win
There ain't no way I'm stopping, already paid my dues
Failure is not an option, I got too much too lose
Running out of energy, I come hot in the coldest way

Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just give it a go go, give it a go, give it a go go
Just give it a go go, give it a go, give it a go go
Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just give it a go go, give it a go, give it a go go
Just give it a go go, give it a go, give it a go go
Watch me turn it on

No matter what you tell me, I will never give up
There's no excuse for failing, so don't hold your breath for love
I will never let you come and steal my joy
Just give up stop trying, I'm no concern of yours
If I'm just a pilot, won't you come fly with me
You're wasting so much time with this negativity
Let me give it to you in the coldest way
There's no need to hate, I will never change

Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just give it a go go, give it a go, give it a go go
Just give it a go go, give it a go, give it a go go
Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just give it a go go, give it a go, give it a go go
Just give it a go go, give it a go, give it a go go
Watch me turn it on
