I ain't tryna think about it, no

Go in slow, and I want you to pipe it
And I think I kinda like ya
Up against the wall, we don't need a title

Get a little bad, baby, watch me blow it down

All you gotta do is say Yes

Going in like we ain't got no time left
Pick me up and put your dinner on the table
Don't stop, ah, won't stop
'Til I feel it in the right spot
Now I'm on top
