[Verse 1: Timbaland]
I ain't got no money
(Don't matter, don't matter)
I ain't got no car to take you on a date
(Don't matter, don't matter)
I can't even buy you flowers
(yeah)
But together we can be the perfect soul mates
(ooh, ahh)
Talk to me girl

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Anytime I'm alone, I can't help thinking about you (ahhh)
All I want, all I need, honestly, is just me and you (ahhh)
Yeah, talk to me girl

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Our love they say it's wrong, but
That's the way you turn me on
We got that good love
We got that good love
We got that bad love they say it's wrong, but
That's the way you turn me on
We got that good love
We got that good love
We got that bad love

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
I ain't got no Visa
(Don't matter, don't matter)
I ain't got no Red American Express
(Don't matter, don't matter)
We can't go nowhere exotic
It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best
Talk to me girl

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Anytime I'm alone I can't help thinking about you (ahhh)
All I want, all I need, honestly, is just me and you (ahhh)
Yeah, talk to me girl

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Our love they say it's wrong, but
That's the way you turn me on
We got that good love
We got that good love
We got that bad love they say it's wrong, but
That's the way you turn me on
We got that good love
We got that good love
We got that bad love

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Give me boy our love
(Even when it's raining down)
Oh, he give it to me
(Can't stop so shut your mouth)
He give it to me
(and if you don't know
Then now you know it, babe
Know it, babe, yeah yeah)

[vocals]

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
We got that good love
(Pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up)
We got that good love
(Pickin' it up, pickin' it up
