[Verse 1: Kamille, Perrie & Jesy]
When you think, when you think, when you think you're alo-o-one
I'll be-be-be like a ghost behind you
When you're down, when you're down
When you're down and you can't find the things to say
You know I'll give my words to you-you
When the sea, when the seasons change
And the sun shines on-on your face
Yeah, I-I-I'll be there with you, you, you, you, you
You're a part, you're a part for me now
Ju-ju-ju-just as mu-mu-much as I'm a part of you

[Pre-Chorus: Kamille & Jade]
I find peace in every story you told
I think of you, I'll never be alone
It's true, true, true
You know I do, do, do

[Chorus: All]
Oh, I need you more than words can say
Oh, you save me in ways that I can't explain
Always been there for me, now I'll do the same
Oh, I need you more than words can say

[Verse 2: Leigh-Anne, Perrie, (Jade) & Jesy]
Won't forget, won't forget
Won't forget when he bro-o-oke my heart
Ho-o-o-ow you helped me through
You turned, you turned, you turned a disaster into a dream
Gave me the power, made my life brand ne-e-w
(When the world try to break us, we found magic
And we grew stronger, though every line, line, l-line, line, line)
Every night, every night, every night
I stand and sing the truth
Now-now they know that they gon' be alright, alright

[Pre-Chorus: Kamille & Jesy]
I find peace in every story you told
I think of you, I'll never be alone
It's true, true, true
You know I do, do, do

[Chorus: All]
Oh, I need you more than words can say
Oh, you save me in ways that I can't explain (Oh-woah-oh)
Always been there for me, now I'll do the same
Oh, I need you more than words can say

[Bridge: Leigh-Anne & Jade]
Oh-woah-oh, yeah
I find peace in every story you told
I think of you, I'll never be alone
Oh, it's true
You know I do, yeah

[Chorus: All]
Oh, I need you more than words can say (More than words can say)
Oh, you save me in ways that I can't explain (Ways that I can't explain, baby)
Always been there for me, now I'll do the same (Always been there for me, now I'll do the same)
Oh, I need you more than words can say

[Outro: Jesy]
Oh, I need you more than words can say
