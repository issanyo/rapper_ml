[Intro: Amar & Timbaland]
{*harmonizing for 6 seconds*}

Mere zindagi... tere ho gayhe (c'mon)
Ye diwanagi (huh) na roke kubi (yeah)

[Verse: Amar]
Mere zindagi, tere ho gayhe (bring it back)
Ye diwandigi, na roke kubi (bring it back)
Mere zindagi, tere ho gayhe (bring it back)
Ye diwandigi, na roke kubi (break it down)
Mudhoss hayra dil mai bat kiya? (Say what?)
Ah-ha-ha-ha, pucho na; ah-ha-ha-ha, pucho na
Mudhoss hayra dil mai bat kiya?
Ah-ha-ha-ha, pucho na; ah-ha-ha-ha (frikki-frikki-c'mon)
Ahja tu ahja mere saminay tu ahja jaanu (ah)
Kitna tashowu gay, kitna bolowo gay muchay tum (ah)
Ahja tu ahja mere saminay tu ahja jaanu (oh~!)
Kitna tashowu gay, kitna bolowo gay muchay tum (frikki-frikki-uh)

[Hook: Timbaland & Amar]
Ain't no way in the world I'm gon' leave you baby
You're my treasure and I got the key to you baby
Let's ride on my Titanic baby
Daily lovin' go down as one of the greatest
There's no me without you, you
Baby girl you make my dream come true, sing it to me
Tu hay tu hay, hum yaha hay
Aahoo chulay, ish jahan say
Aahoo millay, zazah millay
Ubb hum bahoto, ek ho jahay

[Interlude: Timbaland]
Hey, hey, hey, hey - put it up y'all
Hey, hey, hey, hey - and give it to me
Hey, hey, hey, hey - put it up y'all
Hey, hey, hey, hey - and give it to me (C'mon)
Hey, hey, hey, hey - put it up y'all
Hey, hey, hey, hey - and give it to me
Hey, hey, hey, hey - put it up y'all
Hey, hey, hey, hey - and give it to me
Hey, hey, hey, hey - put it up y'all
Hey, hey, hey, hey - and give it to me

[Timbaland]
Hey, hey, hey, hey - put it up y'all
Hey, hey, hey, hey - Jim Beamz break it down now

[Jim Beamz] & (Timbaland)
Ooooooo-ah-ahhhhh, ooooooo-ah-ahhhhh (I like that, uh)
Ooooooo-ah-ahhhhh, ooooooo-ah-ahhhhh (I like that, uh)
Ooooooo-ah-ahhhhh, ooooooo-ah-ahhhhh (I like that, uh)
Ooooooo-ah-ahhhhh, ooooooo-ah-ahhhhh
