Here I come daddy, daddy
Stroke your paddy-waddy pancakes
When I rock the Sista bounce I make my ass shake
Tango, Rock N' Roll
Dance motherfucker, dance motherfucker, ho
I got more bounce to the ounce when I ounce's amounts
And I'm turnin' shit out, and I'm burnin' shit out
Hot damn, I got my Sista clan freakin'
That dance from ?, yeah I think I need a
Phat bass line to make you pop that coochie
For all you hot hoochies, shake your fishy sushi's
Now I'm about to be out with my nigga
DeVante swing me out, do the Sista bounce out
