[Intro]
Shake it, Shake it
Shake it, Shake it
Shake it, Shake it
Bounce, Bounce
Bounce, Bounce

[Verse 1]
Baby you the man
Cause you put it on me
And in the morning
I roll over and feel you touching on me
I got another man
But he ain't like you
And I can't be your baby mama
Though I'd like to
C-C-C-C-C-Call me real late at night
When my man's asleep
And take a red eye
To the west side up and down my spine
And let you feel what you've been missing
I'm so bonafide

[Hook]
Call me
Ooo, when you need me
Baby, you don't have to worry
Call me
We can do something

Call me
Ooo, when you need me
Baby, you don't have to worry
Call me
We can do something

[Verse 2]
Baby, take my hand
When you're feeling lonely
It don't matter where you're at
Just let me put it on you
I got another man
But he ain't like you
And I can't be your baby mother
Though I'd like to
C-C-C-C-Call me at the break of dawn
I'll be sure to meet you with no panties on
We can slip and slide
We can take a ride
And feel the love that you've been missing
I'm so bonafide

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You can call me
You can call me
Call me

[Hook]
