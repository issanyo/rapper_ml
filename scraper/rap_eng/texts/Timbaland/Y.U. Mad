[Intro: Nicki]
I told Stunna I said you know they on that regular degular
I said me… I’m on that 1.5 on a skinny tire

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I am the female Weezy, this shit is easy
Pull up in that new new, bitch get a squeegee
Yeah my flow sick, yeah my flow queasy
Haha, they were sleeping on me, z-zz-zz
This pussy clean, this pussy squeaky
That pussy old, that pussy creaky
When I’m out the country, niggas call me Neeki
Hi, How are you? Yes, it’s nice to meet me
Damn, Billboard, I mean I’m winning but I’m still bored
Yeah we shine, gold cluster
As for your career, dead: Ghost Busters

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
That’s why you mad

Get down or lay down
Shoot up anything except a school or playground
Triple OG nigga, these hoes know me
Shining AK blood, just like a trophy
I’m old school, and I’ll smack a bitch
Getting money like a motherfucking cracker bitch

Got the game on lock like football nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I got the world in my wallet
Swisha full of violet
Niggas think they fly make me check ya flight mileage
That P on my hat is for Piru, not Pirates
I bet I can turn her pussy to a fucking fire hydrant
And I do it for my niggas, my muthafucking niggas
Cause these hoes so thirsty like they got the fucking hiccups
I am beast ho, to say the least ho
No cut on the coke, thats coke zero
Yeah tonight, I’ll probably fuck another nigga girl
Party time, excellent, Waynes World
This Cash Money nigga, eat a dick
Been had it on lock, gave the key to Nick’

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
That’s why you mad
That's why you why you mad mad

That's why you why you mad mad
That’s why you mad
That's why you why you mad mad
