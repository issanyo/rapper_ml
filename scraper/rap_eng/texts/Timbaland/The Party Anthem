[Intro: Timbaland]
1, 2, 1, 2
I said 1, 2, 1, 2
Everybody hands up in the air
1, 2, 1, 2
Let me see your drinks up in the air
1, 2, 1, 2
1, 2, 1, 2

[First Verse: Timbaland]
It's that modern day Tony Stark, biggest dog in the game with the biggest bark
Money, money, money, money don't make the man
Man make the money with the biggest master plan
I got the, got the, got the, got these niggas going nuts
Raising bottles in the air, the money they throwing up
Peep my, peep my, peep my, peep my, peep my game boy
When it's all said and done I'm hall of fame boy
I'm riding, riding, riding, riding in a new ghost
With my business partner, nah, not White Wed french folks
Call me, call me, call me, call me “Tim: The Party Man”
Be in the clubs and radio all on one command
Now show your hands

[Hook: T-Pain]
Okay (okay), let's get it jumping (let's get it jumping)
Turn up the speakers
Can you hear the bass bumping?
Them tweeters tweaking
I came here to party, pass that cup around (round)
Put your hands in the air move'm up and down (down)
Hey (hey), give me a bottle and a fucking cup
Fuck that cup, I'm about to turn that bottle up
Cause I cam here to party, pass that cup around (round)
Put your hands in the air move'm up and down (down)
Oohwoah

[2nd Verse: Lil Wayne]
I heard somebody said he wasn't dead yet
They should've never said that
Young Tunechi got the game down Pat Sajak
Even though I'm paid in full, all I want is Payback
Man, fuck these niggas. Pause
I spray king kill the world and fuck them all in my cigars
I make them mother fuckers bow down, no applause
All of my goons wired up like broken jaws
I rep that mother fucking red flag put you in a dead bag
I get bread you get the crumbs at the bottom of the bread bag
And my letters is Y M, shout out Stunna and Slim
I'm fucking with Tim and my girl, I'm fucking her friend
Tunech!

[Hook]

[3rd Verse: Missy Elliott]
This country bitch from Virginia
See the way the crowd go wild when Misdemeanor 'bout to enter
Everybody better bow down when I step up to the mic; front and center
Say I'm too old to rap, I'll be rapping til I wear dentures
Yeah, hello haters
You mad? Pick your chin up
What did I say about running your mouth? You better respect your mentors
I'm so relentless flow colder than the winters
I'm pretty in the face and I should pose for a pin-up (I drink my gin up)
I'm on the mic, I'm back with Tim
We looking good like working out up in the gym
Anybody wanna see us? Competition? We don't see'm
Ain't nothing change, we ahead of the game above the rim
This how we do it

[Hook]

[Outro: Timbaland]
1, 2, 1, 2
I said 1, 2, 1, 2
Everybody hands up in the air
1, 2, 1, 2
Let me see your drinks up in the air
1, 2, 1, 2
