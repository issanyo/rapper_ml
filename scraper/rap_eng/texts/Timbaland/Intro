Intro

Verse 1:
This flow is hideous reapin us insidious
Double cupping purple man that shit make me delirious
Only if I check it flow more colder day old pizza crust
I crave it lust yeah ya girl is serious
Bush be climbing higher than a wire full ah cannabis
Wrap it up like rubbers fuck in silence like anonymous
Silhouettes of cigarettes now the ash to dust
If you think that you're a goddess than you really must
Love it when I drink whats let up from the cabinet
Catch me while I'm fallen like a fish in nets
Sick of getting higher than a kite or fighter jet
Super soak her pussy wet why so serious
Slide my dick in like a keyhole
Raid my body cancerous til death upon my kimo
Never been awarded by a rose that shits decapreo
Like um white and dirty like a starbucks cappuccino
Pause take a breath and then I knock out
Dying for redemption maybe find me in a shootout
Coke thick got your kids on snow routes
Rather smoke a thousand packs before i smoke an ounce
Watch her ass bouncing, man that shits astounding
Back to lil bow turn hit her rebounding
Air max 90s kid stuck in 80s soundin
Keep them whiter than a napkin
Kandi sold to cubans pbs zooming
Never born a child star drugs for no abusin
Brusin addy off the counter in my kitchen
Pick me up like danny does for sour and the bitches
D so big that it make her cum quicker
J-a-k-o-b cept simpler
Catch me blowin marble while I'm cutting up vanilla ice
Catch me on your tape recording of the fuckin antichrist
Stand up for my color scream out all the lights
No I'm not a killer cause on this side I'm more bright
Sideways turning from the turn up
Took away my dignity in the rings around a solo cup
Societies virginity was taken after hours
Showed her how I style had her screaming "black power"
Blew me like her powder after sex she need a shower
Sounding the alarm when she drink up all the liquor

Hook:
J-a-k-o-b dick bigger
Rather take a bullet from the barrel to my trigger (x4)
