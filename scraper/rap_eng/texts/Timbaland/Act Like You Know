[Verse 1]
Most of the time you don't be trippin' on me
All of a sudden you wanna be the police (ooh)
Lookin' me up and down before I leave home
Makin' a big deal out of what I got on

[Hook]
But hey, you need to know
I'm still the woman you got with and I know my place
I think you know
These things were never effecting now you hate
Because you know
You not the only one that's checkin for me
But that's the way it goes
In this relationship so act like you know

[Verse 2]
You better know that I'm not gon' be
Rearrangin everything in my world
Not gonna feel bad for chillin wit my girls (ooh)
They already know I ain't goin nowhere
You wanna believe that they put me out there

[Hook] (2x)

[Bridge] (2x)
I don't mean no disrepect, but, um...
I was the same way when you met me, and, um...
I ain't gonna leave just yet, but, um...

[Hook] (2x)
