[Verse 1:]
I'm standing at the fork in the road
And I
Don't really know which way to go
It's like
Seventeen years ago all over again

And I
I'm a little girl lost alone
And yes
I wanna know what lies ahead
And yeah
My feet are planted
And I don't wanna take a step cause

[Hook:]
I won't make it any further
With you on my back
Carry a burden
I can't do it this time
Goodbye

Then again
Do I listen to my heart?
Do I cry for help?
I keep second guessing myself
Why does it have to be so hard to let you go?

[Chorus:]
Its almost sun down
I gotta put my foot down
And I know if I do
It's gonna hurt me more than it hurts you

I know how much you need me
Breaks my heart
Believe me

Now I know what I gotta do
But it's gonna hurt me more than it hurts you
More than it hurts you
More than it hurts you

But it's gonna hurt me more than it hurts you
More than it hurts you
More than it hurts you
But it's gonna hurt me

[Verse 2:]
Now ordinarily I wouldn't give up
I'm no quitter
But under the circumstance
I think it's better that I wash my hands of ya
Love ya

But I'm thinking that I can't live with ya
Can't live without ya
It's something about ya
That makes me wanna stick around and stay settled down
Even if it kills me but I can't 'cause

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

I'm walking away like
Goodbye
You got me walking away like
Goodbye
