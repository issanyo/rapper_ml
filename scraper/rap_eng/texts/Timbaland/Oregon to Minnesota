This Oregonian kid is goin’ in
No end when you let the flow begin
So logical and very geological the way I’ve
Rocked flows since the Devonian
They see me, the flow way speedy
I make you wanna throw away your Lil Wayne CD
Copy of the Carter IV
See me hoppin’ in the car door, for
The hell of it I’ll never stay relevant
I’m more like an elephant who stands in the middle of a room
‘Cause I never get mentioned I sit on the bench and
I discovered a penchant for truth
I’m Hagrid, with a big beard
I’m half man half beast here
You’re a centaur that got not rear
Fuck a Dementor, I got no fear
When people don’t like your flow
They'll say you’re like a clone
But never would they write their own
I might condone for you to never let another motherfucker tell you what is right or wrong
When their intention is not to mention how you can strive for a bit of self-improvement
Nah, they just wanna make you feel bad when you spit the real rap and they never do shit
Without music, I might lose it, it’s a bit of a drug, I abuse it
Confused at how life used to be so basic
And now I'm stressed on an everyday basis
But I listen to the 808 bass kick
Maybe someone listening can relate to this
So I make shit and try to make sure that everything I say’s sick
That kid raps? I didn’t know
But always knew that he was very analytical
They look down and they lower their eyes
So surprised, my rhyme’s so organized
Grew up in the 541 so I might go run
In the forest and hide from my fears
I’m tired of wipin’ my tears
Time to switch gears, and rhyme with my peers but I’m better than ninety percent of the cleverest ladies and gentlemen when I’m spitting and I’m coming for the other ten
You can bet I’m gonna get ‘em in a minute and I’m never gonna quit, I got adrenaline up in the pen
Show up, gotta make it blow, fit the quota, then I go bust and they go nuts
Hold up
I rock the mic from Oregon to Minnesota
