[Verse 1: Brandy]
Can I go home with you?
'Cause I'm locked out my house
If I'm alone with you
Then I won't go without
You say you got a room
But just one night in town
It's not a home sweet home
But we can work around

[Pre-Chorus: Brandy]
I just want it to feel like
We're going where it feels right
May not be in the Hills tonight
But as long as you're there

[Chorus: Brandy]
Boy that's when I'm home, home, home
Come on, baby take me home, home, home
Babe, my place is locked out tonight
Come on, what you waiting on on on
I know you wanna go there
Baby let's just go there

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
I'm in your fridge for ice, girl
Like this is my house
We may not make the bed
If we stay long on this couch
Yo, turn the music down
So they can hear you scream
We'll be gone before
They can call the police

[Pre-Chorus: Brandy]
I just want it to feel like
We're going where it feels right
May not be in the Hills tonight
But as long as you're there

[Chorus: Brandy]
Boy that's when I'm home, home, home
Come on, baby take me home, home, home
Babe, my place is locked out tonight
Come on, what you waiting on on on
I know you wanna go there
Baby let's just go there

[Bridge: Brandy]
Somebody out there take me home
Need to go with you
Somebody out there take me home
Need to go with you
Somebody out there take me home
Like to go with you

[Post-Bridge: Brandy x9]
Is there somebody out there?

[Chorus: Brandy]
Boy that's when I'm home, home, home
Come on, baby take me home, home, home
Babe, my place is locked out tonight
Come on, what you waiting on on on
I know you wanna go there
Baby let's just go there
