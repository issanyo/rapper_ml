[Bubba Sparxxx- talking]
Uh huh, yeah
Good Lord
May God have mercy on my soul

[Verse 1- Bubba Sparxxx]
I love her, but you never would know
That by the way I just let my girl go
With tears in her eyes from years of the lies
She backed on up and disappeared out the drive
Wait, hey, what can I say?
All we had means nothin today
I did my thing and she did hers
But my crimes are a wee bit worse
And now I'm sittin here all alone with my guilt
Just me and the dogs in the home that we built
It was Andy's and hers, even though Bubba bought it
But Bubba wouldn't leave just like her mother called it
From the pink, only to the blue blame
God forgive me for causin you pain
All it was, ain't no more
Cause my baby's gone and when it rains it pours

[Hook- Ryan Tedder]
She tried to tell me I needed to be strong
I wasn't listening and now my baby's gone

[Verse 2- Bubba Sparxxx]
One for the pleasure, two for the sin
Three for the family we could a been
Had I not been so concerned
With this life, no spoken words
Could begin to undue what's done
Deep within I know that you must run
Far away, from the thought of my smile
And the broken dream of us walkin that aisle
I first saw +Betty+ in my Nanny White's yard
The breast where the best, and the fanny my lord
A fly country girl, just workin them gifts
She's my queen, was a virgin I guess
But I ain't never ask and I ain't never tell
But Betty had the cash every time I went to jail
And how did I reward her loyalty
Let her walk in and see her cousin Joy on me

[Hook]

I ..
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 3- Bubba Sparxxx]
It's been six months and still no word
I try to carry on like it still don't hurt
Hoes come around but I still won't flirt
Drinking's worse and the pills don't work
Last I heard she was in Birmingham
Livin with a good hard workin man
And lookin back on it, that's exactly what she wanted
Not a rebel with a passion for the moment
I live for the fiddle and the kick in the snout
I take my love and I stick it in there
Moved a Jimmy and made this song
All because my baby's gone

[Hook]
