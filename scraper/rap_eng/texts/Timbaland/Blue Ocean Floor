[Verse 1]
Frequencies so low
Heart on a string
A string that only plays solos
Rain made of echoes
Tidal wave rushing on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you

[Chorus]
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

[Verse 2]
Shell made out of gold
Found on a beach picked up and you held so close
Rain washed out its glow
Heartbeat steadily leads me down below

[Pre-Chorus]
Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you

[Chorus]
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

[Bridge]
20,000 leagues away, catch up to you on the same day
Travel at the speed of light, thinking the same thoughts at the same time
Heartbeat set at steady pace, Iâ€™ll let the rhythm show me the way
No one can find us here, fade out and disappear

[Chorus]
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
