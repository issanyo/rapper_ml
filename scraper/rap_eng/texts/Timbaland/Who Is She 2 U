[Verse 1:]
Don't even think about callin' me crazy
You know you peeped that lady
And when I turned and look at you you tried
To play it off but I can tell that you two were friends
She was just too nervous
She was actin' like she was hurt
Like the memory had surfaced
It kinda got her pissed
I'm kinda wonderin' myself and you're really no help
Tell me how you two know each other so well
Cause I wanna know now you better start talkin'

[Chorus]
Who is she to you?
Don't lie to me
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see
Something going on between you two
I think you better let me know
That's for sure

[VERSE 2:]
No matter how hard you try you can't hide it
There's no way you can deny it
Then you wanna flip and call me insecure
I'm only buggin' because you are so suspicious
Then you say I don't trust ya
Can't understand why I would cuss ya
Ya come off so demandin'
But baby I can be, yeah
Now tell me why did you not say
You're wrong in the first place
For lookin' too hard over that way
And you better tell me what the deal is

[Chorus]
Who is she to you?
Don't lie to me
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see
Something going on between you two
I think you better let me know
That's for sure

[BRIDGE:]
Damn right I wanna know her name
Tell me how you know her baby
Why did she make that face?
You look ashamed
What are you not saying boy?
I'm really not playin' boy
Gotta know right now
You better start explainin' boy

[Chorus]
Who is she to you?
Don't lie to me
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see
Something going on between you two
I think you better let me know
That's for sure
Who is she to you?
Don't lie to me
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see
Something going on between you two
I think you better let me know
That's for sure
