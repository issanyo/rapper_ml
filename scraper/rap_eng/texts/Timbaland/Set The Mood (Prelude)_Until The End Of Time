[Until the End of Time]
[Intro]
Hey hey, oh yeah, oh
Listen

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning
And heard the TV sayin' something
About disaster in the world and
It made me wonder where I'm going
There's so much darkness in the world
But I see beauty left in you girl
And what you give me lets me know
That I'll be alright

[Pre-Hook]
'Cause if your love was all I had in this life
Well that would be enough until the end of time
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you girl until the end of time

[Hook]
You've got me singin' oh yeah, oh yeah
Everybody sing oh yeah
Everybody singin' oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Now if you're ever wonderin'
About the way I'm feelin'
Well baby girl there ain't no question
Just to be around you is a blessin'
Sick and tired of tryin' to save the world
I just wanna spend my time with you girl
And what you give me lets me know
That we'll be alright

[Pre-Hook]
'Cause if your love was all I had in this life
Don't you know that that would be enough until the end of time
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind
Cause I'm gonna love you girl until the end of time
