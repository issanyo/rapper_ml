Ain’t ya heard the word?
What me & him was doin’ while his babymo’ was riding out a bird?
I was riding his dick when you was in bricks
And when your waters drop
I’ll still be on his cock
Your not his main squeeze, bitch, you trapped him wit’ a youte
Run off your mouth I’ll have you disabled like a mute
Bitch gotta’ go
I got a reputation
I could never let my man get caught sleeping wit’ a hoe
That’s a no, no
Yeah, straight disrespect
And if it carry’s on, bitch, I will break your neck
Your fronting that your street
You need to keep your broke ass out my mans sheets
This ain’t a warning
Me, concerning, that your not good at learning
Listening, oiled up his Glock so your face will be glistening
Stinging, can’t you hear it in the ear?
That’s the strap singing. (Gunshot)

If Your Bitch Only Knew what me & you’ve been through
She wouldn’t believe but deep down she’d know it’s true
He don’t want pussy
Especially not yours
I’m exposing what’s behind closed doors
X 2

When you listen to this rhyme
Don’t sweat it
Just understand this faggot ass broad is gonna get it
You wanna tuck my man?
Nah, nah, that ain’t going down
Laughing up
Cos’ all I seem to see is clowns (jokers)
Im a show you why your wrong
Then I’m a show you why your dead wrong
Certain dudes would kill for me boo
But yeah I’ll play along..
He wanna play games
He wanna deceive
But larceny & wounds are all that he’s gonna receive
I don’t make death threats, yo
It’s straight promises
None of you pussy holes could ever demolish this
My flow
Make you bop your head when your drunk or your wavey
When I tek the mic the lines I spit are crazy
C’mon (c’mon)
Bitch test my skills
These bredda’s screaming battyboy fi dead are the same bredda’s is giving thrills (jokers)
So don’t tell me shit
Your mans dick is hard from the words I spit

If Your Bitch Only Knew what me & you’ve been through
She wouldn’t believe but deep down she’d know it’s true
He don’t want pussy
Especially not yours
I’m exposing what’s behind closed doors
X 2

So there it is
The truth is that
Im a deliver this & I promise that it’s fact (I don’t lie)
This warning shot
You need to watch your back (need to watch your back now boo)
