[Intro: Missy]
Hello, hit me on my car phone

[Verse 1]
If your girl only knew
That you was trying to get with me, what would she do?
If your girl only knew
That you was dissing her to talk to me

[Refrain:]
Why you wanna play me, don't play me
You can't fade me, don't fade me
Trying to persuade me, persuade me to get wit' you
Why you wanna play me, don't play me
You can't fade me, don't fade me
Trying to persuade me, and if she only knew

[Verse 2]
If your girl only knew
That I would want to kick it with you
And if your girl could only see
How you be calling me, getting fresh with me

[Refrain]

[Missy Elliot]
If you a chicken head, ba-ba-ba-baw
All up in my grill like ill
'Cause I wear Nikes and do not wear Brigettes
I (skrrrrrrt!) over in my Lex and see you drive by in your Chevette
I burn baby, burn, burn, every time I twist my hips
I see your boyfriend turn, turn
Is it your concern, to see to not to look boo?
What would she do if she knew?

[Bridge]
If your girl only knew (Hit me on my car phone)
If your girl only knew (Ooh, hit me on my car phone)
If your girl only knew (Hit me on my car phone)
If your girl only knew (Ooh, hit me on my car phone)

[Missy Elliot]
Ooh la, la la, googoo, gaga
Tell ya Mama and ya Papa to chuckle wit laughter
Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee
These (censored) don't wanna tassle
With the master of funk bump
Tell 'em what you want.... Don't touch me
M-I-crooked-letter-Y
I bump back, hump back, jump back, die
Fool, a high sigh, wave byes-byes to ya peoples now
Hit you wit this track from the leaders now
Me and Tim, and Aaliyah now
We gon' get down like a how
We gon' get down like a how
We gon' get down like a how
We gon' get down like a how
How you like me now?

[Refrain]
