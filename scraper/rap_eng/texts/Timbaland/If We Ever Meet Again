[Verse 1: Timbaland]
What's somebody like you, doing in a place like this?
Say, did you come alone, or did you bring all your friends?
Say what's your name, what you drinkin'?
I think I know what you're thinking
Baby, what's your sign?
Tell me yours, I'll tell you mine
Say, what's somebody like you
Doing in a place like this?
(One, two, three, c'mon!)

[Hook: Timbaland & Katy Perry]
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again
Won't let you get away - say if we ever meet again
This free fall (ahh) got me so (ohh)
Kiss me all night don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again

[Timbaland]
Ohh, ohh
Say if we ever meet again

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Do you come here much? I swear I've seen your face before (before, yeah)
Hope you don't see me blush, but I can't help but want you more, more
Baby, tell me what's your story?
I ain't shy and don't you worry
I'm flirting with my eyes, wanna leave with you tonight
Do you come here much?
I gotta see your face some more
Some more, 'cause baby...

[Hook: Timbaland & Katy Perry]
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again
Won't let you get away - say if we ever meet again
This free fall (ahh) got me so (ohh)
Kiss me all night don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again

[Bridge: Timbaland & Katy Perry]
If we ever meet again, I'll have so much more to say
(If we ever meet again)
If we ever meet again, I won't let you go away
(If we ever meet again)
If we ever, ever meet again, I'll have so much more to say
(If we ever meet again)
If we ever, ever meet again, I won't let you go away
Away-ay-ay-ay

[Hook: Timbaland & Katy Perry]
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again
Won't let you get away - say if we ever meet again
This free fall (ahh) got me so (ohh)
Kiss me all night don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again
Won't let you get away - say if we ever meet again
This free fall (ahh) got me so (ohh)
Kiss me all night don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again

[Outro: Sebastian]
Just when the night can't get no less
Porn star startin', what is this?
Vixens fightin' for their stress
I put in like Mr. West, yes
You gon' finish dear
And your body's so superb
Me and you the best in here
But yo' girl, face and ear
Face and ear, face and ear
Face and ear, face and ear
