Uh, you see just how I roll nigga, roll nigga
Bulldoze, roll o's nigga, o's nigga
Timbaland with that beat so, beat so
Homey with that cheap dro, Miami and that beach so
Drink up more heat though but only for a beat though
Catch me at ? ? with brands up at Ecko
To all these niggas frontin' actin' like they wantin' somethin'
Niggas tryin'a rock me to sleep like ? ? does it
Na-na, and I ain't gotta call for it
Na-na, hell nah ain't gonna fall for it
Always with good roll on tour gotta stall for it
I ain't them other dudes with braids and a pink fro
Niggas only creep through the hood just when they tip toe
Waitin' till your mans come home, gather your boom box
Niggas never been in them real clubs like ? ?
So is you men or mice or, I'm in the candy paint
Old school iller ?, drinkin' that Jaegermeister

Now, go head homey you can call me your henchman
Cause all them dudes dumber than Jessica Simpson, stupid
Courtney Love, stupid, you ain't a thug stupid
Deep down you just really need a hug stupid
Ha, ha, while I'm travelling Vegas
Luxory hotel, pyramid spaces, room service
Room service, and I don't like fake dudes
Hate fake gangstas and hate fake boobs
Tear that make-up on, a little mascara
A little Britney, a little Aguilera
Black girl ass livin' the Riviera
Nah I ain't Justin, won't cry you a river
Lie you a river, won't try you a river
But stone you a river, what, clone you a river
Bone you a river, what, or throne you a river
I'm a alcoholic, shorty could you loan me your liver, hey

So can you really hear all that
Norey-orey's got a hit, gotta figure deal that
Bang on bedroom backboards
Treat her ass like a layer, so now I gotta slap boards
Slap boards, for a hard nail cores
The same as G4's, nigga got the energy
Even on that late night, Norey got energy
Even on that wake up fuck I got some energy
Even on that quickie mami, papi got some energy
Sly nigga, tear the walls off crotch
I snap your girlfriend's, girlfriend's, girlfriend's watch
