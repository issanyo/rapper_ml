[Verse 1-Empire Cast ]
I be on my job, let me in the door
Something like a thug, but an entrepreneur
Might not see tomorrow, so I gotta get it
I kill all my competition, call the paramedics
I need that paper, put it in my hand, don't be confused
And if you keep it real with me then I keep it real with you
I keep that rap going every minute sorry but I gotta get it
50 on that, give me all that, give me  alright
Better not talk back

[Hook--Empire Cast]
Cause I work hard just so I can play hard
But if you work a lil' harder you can play even harder
So I be on my hustle hard hustle hard hustle hard
Cause I work hard just so I can play hard
But if you work a lil' harder you can play even harder
So I be on my hustle hard hustle hard hustle hard
Oh my God
Oh my God
[Verse 2-Empire Cast]
Slow money don't make no money, so keep that over there
Mamma ain't raise a dummy, cause I'm a thoroughbred
Benjamin Benjamin, think I might need some ritalin
And I need  the 3 star cause I be working with Timbaland
Bout that dollar bill, gotta count a mill
But if it don't make dollars chill, or close the deal
Keep that client over every minute sorry but I gotta get it
50 on that, give me all that, give me alright
Better not talk back

Cause I work hard just so I can play hard
But if you work a lil' harder you can play even harder
So I be on my hustle hard hustle hard hustle hard
Cause I work hard just so I can play hard
But if you work a lil' harder you can play even harder
So I be on my hustle hard hustle hard hustle hard
Cause I work hard just so I can play hard
But if you work a lil' harder you can play even harder
So I be on my hustle hard hustle hard hustle hard
Cause I work hard just so I can play hard
But if you work a lil' harder you can play even harder
So I be on my hustle hard hustle hard hustle hard
