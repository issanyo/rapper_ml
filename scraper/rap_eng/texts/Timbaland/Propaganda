[Verse 1]
Floozy
You got me trapped in your dark fantasy world
Don't you know you make me woozy?
You have me wrapped around your little finger

[Chorus]
Baby, don't you know you can't lose
You make me offers that I can't refuse
You keep telling pretty lies
You toy with the truth
Oh you're killing me with your

Cold chick
You ate my soul just like a Death Eater
I'm the ocean, you're an oil slick
Now I am choking on your thought pollution

You make me offers that I can't refuse
You keep telling pretty lies
You toy with the truth
Oh you're killing me with your

You make me offers that I can't refuse
You keep telling pretty lies, babe
Baby, don't you know you can't lose?
You make me offers that I can't refuse, yeah
You contort me with your lies, babe
Don't you know that you just can't lose?
You make me offers that I can't refuse, yeah
You keep telling pretty lies
You play with the truth
Oh you're killing me with your
