[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning
And heard the TV saying something
About disaster in the world and
It made me wonder where I'm going
There's so much darkness in the world
But I see beauty left in you, girl
And what you give me let's me know that I'll be alright

[Chorus]
'Cause if your love was all I had, in this life
Well, that would be enough until the end of time
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you, girl, until the end of time

[Refrain]
You've got me singing
Oh whoa, yeah
Oh whoa, yeah
Everybody sing
Oh whoa, yeah
Everybody singing
Oh whoa, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now if you're ever wondering
About the way I'm feeling
Well, baby girl, there ain't no question
Just to be around you is a blessing
Sick and tired of trying to save the world
I just want to spend my time with you, girl
And what you give me
Lets me know that we'll be alright

[Chorus]
'Cause if your love was all I had (all I had), in this life
(Don't you know that) that would be enough until the end of time
Rest your weary heart (rest your heart) and relax your mind
(Relax your mind 'cause)
'Cause I'm gonna love you, girl, until the end of time

[Refrain]
Girl, you got me singing
Oh whoa, yeah
Oh whoa, yeah
Everybody sing
Oh whoa, yeah
Everybody singing
Oh whoa, yeah

[Bridge]
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Break it down one time

[Refrain]
Oh whoa, yeah
Oh whoa
Oh whoa, whoa, yeah
Oh whoa

[Outro]
'Cause if your love was all I had, in this life
That would be enough until the end of time
