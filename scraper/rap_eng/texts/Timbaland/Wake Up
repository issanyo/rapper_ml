[Intro: Missy Elliott (& Jay-Z)]
Eh yo Hov, tell em, hip hop betta wake up
(Yeah, turn the muhfuckin music up
Yeah, turn the muhfuckin music up)

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
Motherfuckers betta wake up, stop sellin crack to the black
Hope you bought a spare for your flat
Can't accept me talkin real facts
Down the hill like Jill and Jack, I speak what yah weak mind lacks
Yah heard that
I'm creative to the fullest
What you talkin bout Willis
Cause your talkin never kill it
I hear but don't feel it
Thou ain't realest, you just sweet meat in the village
Yeah I'm a Don Diva Don Niva
Y'all not seen her, heater squeezed into a wife beater
Yep I'm a top leader, I got the Martin Luther King fever
I'ma feed ya, watch ya teacher, need to preach ya
It's time to get serious, black people all areas
Who gon carry us? It ain't time to bury us
Cause music be our first love, say 'I Do' let's cherish it

[Hook]
If you dont gotta gun (its alright)
If yah makin legal money, (its alright)
If you gotta keep yah clothes on, (its alright)
You ain't got a cellular phone, (its alright)
And yah wheels dont spin, (its alright)
And you gotta wear them jeans again, (its alright)
Yeah if you tried oh well, (its alright)
MC's stop the beef lets sell, (its alright)

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
Hip-Hop better wake up, the bed to make ups
Some of y'all be faker than a drag on make up
Got issues to take up, before we break up
Like Electra let go, Missy Anita Baker
I love Jacob but jewelry won't fix my place up
Gotta stay up, studio nights to cake up
Now check my flavor, rich folks is now my neighbors
I got cable, now check out how I made my paper
Hip-Hop don't stop, be my Lifesaver
Like Kobe and Shaq if they left Lakers
I'm like an elevator DJ on the crossfader
Black people wake up and see your ass later

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I need rims that don't listen and a booming system
First piece of change I see, I'm gon get one
745 no license to drive
I ain't even got a home, I guess I'll live in my ride
Fuck it!... ("rewind" - *echoes*)
"I can hear myself, but I can't feel myself
I'm wanna feel myself like Tweet
745 no license to drive
I ain't even got a home, I guess I'll live in my ride
Fuck it, couple karats in the ear won't hurt
Need a nice chain, laying on this thousand dollar shirt
Evisu Jeans cover the rectum, my kick game just like David Beckham
Anybody in my way, I wet them
I'mma be this way till the cops come catch 'em
Till detectives sketch em
On the sidewalk wit chalk, New York's infections
Till I got taught a lesson
Couple niggas gone, couple went Corrections, Emory Got 10
Ty got 15, nigga even my kin
Got five years bringin nineteen in
But just think I used to think like them
Now they gotta live through the pictures that I send them in the pen
Hope you don't start ya life where I end...
WAKE UP!

WAKE UP [x15]

[Hook]
