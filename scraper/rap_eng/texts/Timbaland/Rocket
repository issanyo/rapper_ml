[Verse 1]
Let me sit this ass on you, show you how I feel
Let me take this off, will you watch me
Yes, mass appeal
Don't take your eyes, don't take your eyes off it
Watch it, babe
If you like, you can touch me, baby
Do you, do you wanna touch me, baby?
Grab a hold, don't let go
Let me know, that you, ready
I just wanna show you now, slow it down, go around
You rock hard, I rock steady

[Chorus]
And rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, babe, over me

[Bridge]
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls

[Verse 2]
I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass, when you put it in your face
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create rockets and waterfalls

[Chorus]
And rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me babe, over me

[Interlude]
Hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady
Rock, hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady

[Verse 3]
Don't you know that I give you the loving if you need it
I give you my word, you can believe it
Your love feels like all four seasons growing inside me
Life has a reason, swimming in my love, your love lifting
Higher, harder
Got me screaming to the Lord, boy
Kiss me, pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, rock it 'til the water falls
Damn

[Verse 4]
I can't help but love the way we make love
Daddy, daddy
Ooh child, ooh now, yes Lord, damn baby
Driving me cray, cray
You ain't right for doing it to me like that daddy
Even though I've been a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad girl
Tell me what you're gonna do about that
Punish me, please
Punish me please
Daddy, what you gon' do with all this ass
All up in your face?
Yeah, hell yeah, ride me so deep
Ooh, my shit's so good that it ain't even right
I know I'm right
Hell yeah, you the shit
That's why you're my equivalent
So sexy
We're so much more than pointless fixtures
Instagram pictures, consumers
What about that ching-ching-ching
Wanna rock that, wanna rock that ching-ching
Baby boomers, baby, baby, baby, baby
Cyclical trends, tryna fit in
Home is where the heart is
Goddamnit, I'm comfortable in my skin
And you're comfortable in my skin
You look so comfortable in my skin
Rockets and waterfalls

[Outro]
Damn
