[Verse 1]
Hey what's your name? Let's meet up in the sheets
I know you got the same interest doin' the freak
You's fire, yeah you hot
Let's meet, yeah we should speak

[Chorus]
I just want to take you out
And do those things that lovers do
Girl I just want to take you out
And do those things that lovers do
And I wanna take you out

[Verse 2]
I'm steadily trying to find the words to say
'Cause you never gon' know [?] new flow
Hit a few notes, flip the track
Devante take 'em back

[Verse 3]
I've been watchin' you
For so very long
'Cause you are the one
You oughta talk to me
For the 3rd time, for the 4th time
For the 5th time, for the 8th time
For the 9th time, girl I don't mind
Speak your mind, cause if you got it
Consistency

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I wanna take you out
And show you what this life is all about
Maybe take you to the moon
Maybe drive you down south
You can have a love tonight
I promise you, no doubt
Maybe later on
I'll get my tongue in your mouth
Wet and deep, girl

[Bridge]
If you don't mind
You're so fine
Do you wanna go?
Baby I just gotta know and have to know
If we can get freaky tonight
Baby I just gotta know and have to know
If we can get freaky tonight
Baby I just gotta know and have to know
If we can get freaky tonight
Baby I just gotta know and have to know
If we can get freaky tonight

[Break]
Close, close, let's get close
Close, close, let's get close
Close, close, let's get close
Close, close, let's get close

[Chorus]
