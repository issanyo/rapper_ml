[Intro]
Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, I wrote this song for you
Listen

[Verse 1]
Everybody's looking for the fliest thing to say (Fliest thing to say)
But I just want to fly (fly away with you, you, you, you)
I don't want to be the one to alienate, yeah (Alienate)
You see, I'm trying to find an alien in you (you) if it's cool, (Cool)

[Pre-Chorus]
We can't take an airplane
Where we're going is way too high
Going where the day sky turns into night
I got the windows special tinted for the stars that get too bright
And I saved you a seat, so let's ride

[Chorus]
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (me and you)
And with the top down
We'll cruise around
Land and make love on the moon
(Would you like that?)
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (me and you)
And with the top off, you're all wrapped up
In my space lover cocoon

[Post-Chorus]
And I love it when I hear you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Sing to me
I love it when I hear you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Sing to me (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Now everybody knows that you're from outer space (Outer space)
But honey, I just want to turn out this space with you (You, you, you)
So drive me to your galaxy where I could play, yeah (That milky way)
And sugar, I'll take my time
And show you the backseat view, (view) if it's cool (Cool)

[Pre-Chorus]
We can't take an airplane
Where we're going is way too high
Going where the day sky turns into night
I got the windows special tinted for the stars that get too bright
And I saved you a seat, so let's ride

[Chorus 2]
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (And that's me and you)
And with the top down
We'll cruise around
Land and make love on the moon
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (Me and you)
And with the top off, you're all wrapped up
In my space lover cocoon

[Post-Chorus]
And I love it when I hear you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Sing to me
I love it when I hear you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Go on and sing to me
Now break it down

[Breakdown]
Hey...
This is the part
Where you, and me, and all of the stars collide tonight
This is the part
Where we take off
And then we fly far away, far away, far away

[Chorus]
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (Me and you)
And with the top down
We'll cruise around
Land and make love on the moon
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (me and you)
And with the top off, you're all wrapped up
In my space lover cocoon

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Outro]
Baby, can't you see all the stars?
They shine, they shine
Just for you
I said oh, yeah, yeah
Just hop into my spaceship coupe
I saved a seat for you
Right here next to me
I'm going to take you to the moon
And I'm going to make you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I love it when I hear you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And you love it when I make you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, this is the part
Where you, and me, and all of the stars collide tonight
This is the part
Where we take off
And then we fly far away, far away, far away
