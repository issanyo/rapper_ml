[Intro]
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth

[Verse 1]
Everyone, has a closet
In the night, they wear disguises
In the dark, they hide from the truth
In the end, they lie to you

[Pre-Chorus]
One day the skeletons are gonna come out
One day the elephant in the room will make a sound
Watch out for lions and tigers and bears
It's bout to hit the fan, better beware

[Chorus]
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth

[Verse 2]
Tell her why you lie for no reason
They point fingers and bite the hand that feeds them
Help em, Lord for they know not what they do
Swear to God they know better than you

[Pre-Chorus]
One day the skeletons are gonna come out
One day the elephant in the room will make a sound
Watch out for lions and tigers and bears
It's bout to hit the fan, better beware

[Chorus]
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth

[Bridge]
The closest people to you, you can't trust
Your family hurts you more than your friend does
There ain't no where to hide, nowhere to go
You better watch, the finger too damn close

[Chorus]
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
