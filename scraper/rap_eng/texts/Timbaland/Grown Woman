[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I remember being young, tough, brave
I knew what I needed
I was spending all my nights and days laid back day dreaming
Look at me I’m a big girl now, said I'm gon' do something
Told the world I would paint this town
Now betcha I run this

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce]
Cause I put it down like that, d-down like that
And I’m making all these racks, a-all these racks
And I’m moving round like that, r-round like that
When I do it I don’t look back, d-don’t look back

[Chorus: Beyonce]
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
They love the way I walk
‘Cause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk ’cause I ain’t pretending
It took a while, now I understand just where I’m goin'
I know the world and I know who I am, It's 'bout time I show it

[Chorus]
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I can be bad if I want
I can say what I want
I can live fast if I want
I can go slow all night long
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want

[Bridge]
I'm a grown woman, and I know that I got it
I'm a grown woman, ain't got no room in my pockets
I'm a grown woman, look down, got you so excited
I really want to know if you got it like that
Cause I got a cute face and my booty so fat
Go girl, she got that bomb, that bomb
That girl, can get whatever she wants
That girl, she got that tight, that tight
Them boys, will do whatever what she likes

[Outro: Beyonce]
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
