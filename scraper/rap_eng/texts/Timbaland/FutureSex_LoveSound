[Intro]
Future sex love sound
Yeah, oh
Ooh, hey

[Verse 1]
You know what you want (Yeah)
And that makes you just like me
See everybody says you're hot, baby
But can you make it hot for me?
Said if you're thinking 'bout holdin' back, don't worry, girl
'Cause I'm gonna make it so easy
So slide a little bit closer to me, little girl
See, Daddy's on a mission to please
Wait a second

[Chorus]
She's hopped up on me, I've got her in my zone
Her body's pressed up on me, I think she's ready to blow
Must be my future sex love sound
And when it goes down, baby, all you gotta do is
Just tell me which way you like that
(All you gotta do is) Tell me which way you like that
Do you like it like this? Do you like it like that?
Tell me which way you like that
(Uh-huh, uh-huh) Tell me which way you like that

[Verse 2]
You can't stop, baby
You can't stop once you've turned me on
And your enemy are your thoughts, baby
So just let 'em go
'Cause all I need is a moment alone
To give you my tongue and put you out of control
And after you let it in, we'll be skin to skin
It's just so natural
Wait a second

[Chorus]
She's hopped up on me, I've got her in my zone
Her body's pressed up on me, I think she's ready to blow
Must be my future sex love sound
And when it goes down, baby, all you gotta do is
Just tell me which way you like that
(All you gotta do is) Tell me which way you like that
Do you like it like this? Do you like it like that?
Tell me which way you like that
(Uh-huh, uh-huh) Tell me which way you like that

[Bridge]
Future sex love sound
Future sex love sound
Future sex love sound
Future sex love sound
Wait a second

[Chorus]
She's hopped up on me, I've got her in my zone
Her body's pressed up on me, I think she's ready to blow
Must be my future sex love sound
And when it goes down, baby, all you gotta do is
Just tell me which way you like that
(All you gotta do is) Tell me which way you like that
Do you like it like that?
Tell me which way you like that
(Uh-huh, uh-huh) Tell me which way you like that
