[Timbaland]
Yeah, uh, Here we go like that, uh, uh, yeah, huh
Yeah, uh, Here we go like that, uh, uh, yeah, uh
Aaliyah, sing

[Verse 1]
If your girl only knew
That you was trying to get with me (what would she do)
If your girl only knew
That you was dissin' her to talk to me

[Chorus]
She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry

[Verse 2]
If your girl only knew
That I would want to kick it with you (if she knew)
And if your girl could only see
How you be calling me, getting fresh with me

[Chorus]
She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry

[Bridge]
She's crazy to put up with you
Oh boy I won't be no fool
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me
But it's dumb to put up with you
I won't be no fool
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me

[Chorus]
She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry

She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry

(If your girl only knew) She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
(If your girl only knew) I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry

If your girl only knew
What you saying, what you saying, what you saying, huh?
What you saying, what you saying, what you saying, huh?
What you saying, what you saying

If your girl only knew
What you saying, what you saying, what you saying, huh?
What you saying, what you saying, what you saying, huh?
What you saying, what you saying

If your girl only knew
What you saying, what you saying, what you saying, huh?
What you saying, what you saying, what you saying, huh?
You ain't saying nothin'

If your girl only knew
What you saying, what you saying, what you saying, huh?
What you saying, what you saying, what you saying, huh?
You ain't saying nothin' baby

Like that
You ain't sayin' nothing baby
Can you feel me can you feel me

Then she wouldn't have to worry
If your girl only knew
If your girl only knew
And then she wouldn't have to worry
If your girl only knew
Curse you out and unplug her phone
If your girl only knew
Wouldn't have to worry
If your girl only knew (leave you alone)
