[Verse 1: Timbaland]
I don't wanna talk now, I don't wanna hear you scream no mo'
Won't somebody save me? Everything I do feel like it's wrong
All we do is fall down even though we try to stay afloat
I swear it's gon' kill me even though you think it won't
So why rock the boat and make waves?
When everything's calm and okay
So why am I confused if you love me?
I thought this would be smooth sailing

[Chorus: The Fray (Joe King)]
'Cause I don't want to let you go
But we're caught in the undertow
'Cause I am losing my control
But we're caught in the undertow
Our only prayer is all our own
But we need air, we go alone
'Cause I don't want to let you go
But we're caught in the undertow

[Verse 2: Esthero]
I don't want to cry, every time we try, it never fails
We change the illusion, whenever you go and set the sail
My heart's in your hand, don't you go hurt me again
All we got is one chance and it's sink or swim
So why rock a boat and make waves? (Make waves!)
When everything's calm and okay? (I'm okay!)
Why am I confused if you love me? (Love me!)
I thought this would be smooth sailing

[Chorus: The Fray (Joe King) & Esthero]
'Cause I don't want to let you go
And we're caught in the undertow
'Cause I am losing my control
But we're caught in the undertow
Our only prayer is all our own
But we need air, we go alone
'Cause I don't want to let you go
But we're caught in the undertow

[Bridge: Timbaland & Esthero]
And the water's rising
And the water's rising
And the water's rising
And the water's rising

[Pre-Chorus: The Fray (Joe King) & Esthero]
'Cause I don't want to let you go
But we're caught in the undertow
'Cause I am losing my control
But we're caught in the undertow

[Chorus: The Fray (Joe King) & Esthero]
'Cause I don't want to let you go
But we're caught in the undertow
And I'm losing my control
But we're caught in the undertow
Our only prayer is all our own
We need air, we go alone
Our only prayer is all our own
We both need air, we go alone
'Cause I don't want to let you go
'Cause I don't want to let you go
'Cause we're caught in the under...
Tow, tow, tow
Undertow, tow, tow
