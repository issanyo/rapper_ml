Woah, woah, woah
Hey hey...

[Chorus]
I got this crazy feeling
I'm gone be single again
I know it, I can feel it
I know you gone mess up

[Verse 1]
Wow, you really turn me on
So I, I really hope I'm wrong
It would break my world If you ain't true to me, yea
But I'm not the silly girl I used to be
And I know how it goes, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Dude's out here think they slick
Got a lot of girls on they (da da da da da)
And they can't say no
Steady telling me they ain't you
I'ma wait to see what you gone do
Hope you know you got a good thing, yeah

[Chorus]
I got this crazy feeling

I'm gon' be single again
I know it, I can feel it
I know you gone mess up

[Verse 2]
I, I love the way we fight, so
I, I hope this is all in my mind (hope it's in my mind)
Baby, don't you know?
It would break my world, if you ain't true to me, yeah
But I'm not the silly girl I used to be
See, I know how it goes

[Pre-Chorus]
Dude's out here think they slick
Got a lot of girls on they (da da da da da)
And they can't say no

[Verse 3]
Your gonna get too comfortable (you gone mess up)
Gonna want something new babe (you gone mess up)
Your gonna be just like the rest (you gone mess up)
It's gonna be you babe before me
I trust my heart, broke down my guard
I worked so hard to take good care of you
I trust my heart, broke down my guard
I worked so hard, I hope it ain't true
