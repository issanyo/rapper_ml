[Verse 1: Timbaland Simon Kvamm]
I ain't got no money
I ain't got no car to take you on a date  Aha
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we could be the perfect soulmates  Aha
Talk to me girl

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go Dutch you can still touch, my love is free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

[Hook 1: Keri Hilson Simon Kvamm]
Baby if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
I'm Scandinavian, everything is what it is
I don't need the G's or the car keys
Boy I like you just the way you are
I'm Scandinavian everything is free

[Verse 2: Timbaland Simon Kvamm]
I ain't got no Visa
I ain't got no Red American Express Aha
We can't go nowhere exotic
It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best Aha
Talk to me girl

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go Dutch you can still touch, my love is free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

[Hook 1: Keri Hilson Simon Kvamm]
Baby if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
I'm Scandinavian, everything is what it is
I don't need the G's or the car keys
Boy I like you just the way you are
I'm Scandinavian everything is what it is
Baby if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
I'm Scandinavian everything is what it is
I don't need the G's or the car keys
Boy I like you just the way you are
I'm Scandinavian everything is free

[Verse 3: John Doe/D.O.E]
Baby girl, I don't got a huge ol' house I rent a room in a house
Listen baby girl, I ain't got a motorboat but I can float ya boat
So listen baby girl, once you get a dose of D.O.E. you gon' want some mo'
So listen baby girl, yeah

[Interlude: Simon Kvamm Keri Hilson]
And we will do it again when
We'll play it again then
And you will hear it again, and
Again and again and
Thug it out 'till we get it right

[Hook 2: Simon Kvamm Timbaland Timbaland & Keri Hilson]
Nothing but the Scandinavian way I are
I'm about to strip and I'm well equiped
Can you handle me the way I are?
Nothing but the Scandinavian way I are
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
Cause I like you just the way I are?
Love me the Scandinavian way I are
I'm about to strip and I'm well equiped
Can you handle me the way I are?
It's properly, the Scandinavian way I are
I'm about to strip and I'm well equiped
Can you handle me the way I are?

[Outro: Simon Kvamm]
I'm Scandinavian everything is, what it is (Oh!)
I'm Scandinavian everything is, what it is (Oh!)
I'm Scandinavian everything is, what it is
