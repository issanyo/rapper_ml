Intro
(Timbaland)
Come on girl
Let me into your life
Gimme a minute, baby gimme the night
I know a secret spot where we can hide
I'll take you there if you're willing to ride

(Nicole)
Look around the place is no surprise
I'm the girl and baby you the guy
I got a body you can exercise
Let's kick it up a notch to 99
Let's dance, let's get physical
Work your body like some cardio
Let's dance, let's get physical
Let's get emotional and take off our clothes

Don't need the breakfast goin' overdrive
I thought the clock was goin' overtime
I got authority to overwrite
Made up my mind i'm staying over night

Look around the place is no surprise
I'm the girl and baby you the guy
I got a body you can exercise
Let's kick it up a notch to 99

Let's dance, let's get physical
Work your body like some cardio
Let's dance, let's get physical
Let's get emotional and take off our clothes

Let's keep moving, don't you stop
We got the groove let's make it hot
And you got to show me what you got
Let's take it to the top

Let's dance, let's get physical
Work your body like some cardio
Let's dance, let's get physical
Let's get emotional and take off our clothes
