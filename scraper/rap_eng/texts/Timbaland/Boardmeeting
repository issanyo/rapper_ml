[Intro: Timbaland]
Clap your hands everybody, if you got, what it takes
I'm Timbo and I want you to know that these, are, da breaks!
(Uh-huh, uh-huh) Hey, get your back up off the wall
(Uh-huh, uh-huh) Hey, get your back up off the wall
(Uh-huh, uh-huh) Hey, get your back up off the wall
(Uh-huh, uh-huh) Huh, let me tell you

[Timbaland]
You got me feenin for your body parts
You said you're lonely and you need it bad
Come and see me when you wanna start
And where we going you don't have to ask

[Hook: Timbaland]
Come to my cipher, put that blunt in the air
Let me seduce you, let me play in your hair
I see that you're hyper, let's take it upstairs
Hey girl, let's have a meeting, meeting

[Timbaland]
I know a quiet place where we can talk
Girl relax and let me do my thang
Baby I don't wanna break yo' heart
I just wanna make you say my name

[Hook: Timbaland]
Come to my cipher, put that blunt in the air
Let me seduce you, let me play in your hair
I see that you're hyper, let's take it upstairs
Hey girl, let's have a meeting, meeting

[Magoo]
I'mma check, make her heart break her man fo' sho'
In the back in my mind girl you in for dough
Even though you a stunt, I'm a fan of chess{?}
Role-play, you the best, you supply the sess
Yes, I'm a fiend of your hole
One hit of you and I lose control
I look through your eyes, I'mma see your soul
Bank roll and a hole through the cars and go

[Hook: Timbaland]
Come to my cipher, put that blunt in the air
Let me seduce you, let me play in your hair
I see that you're hyper, let's take it upstairs
Hey girl, let's have a meeting, meeting

[Outro: Timbaland]
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Get your back up off the wall (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Hey, get your back up off the wall (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Get your back up off the wall (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Meeting's adjourned
(Heh, the meeting just begun, watch this)
