Buddy you can't be serious man...

(Timbaland)
All my ladies put up your vaseline
This a party not a contest or a fight scene
Come here baby won't you lick up on this ice cream
Come here baby won't you get with this A team
Cause we got plenty of bling, plenty of cars
Plenty of things, and honey we all stars (huh)
See I got the game, the game don't got me
See I got the fame, the fame don't got me
Why you had to leave me this way
I love you till this day
All I wanna see is big booties and big titties
And all sexy lingerie
You don't like me, you can go to hell
But I'm with five chicks, sippin zippindale
Laid up in the four seasons hotel
All my dawgs finished, let me hear ya yell

(Chorus)
Girls, show your draws, cause its a party up in here
Fellas, oh yo, lets make this whole room clear
Girls, show your draws, cause its a party up in here
Fellas, oh yo, lets make this whole room clear

(Sincere)
Girls drop your draws for the whips and the chum
Its just sin the don, molesting your thong
I'm aroused spit the pound, get em around
Gave her numbers to dial, now I'm all on the prowl
Made a red bowl well known
Left my head blown like so hard, oh god
Shes a actress, I need prophylactics
Ran to the store, I can't go wrong
Do I want more like clear to one head
Spread your legs on my Versace bed spread
My wrist bricked up see the ice on my arm
Need two parking lots to park my car
I'ma star, play the bar here's a tip
Girl move your hips, put this between your tits
Buddy its a hit when I came in the door
And I said it before I wanna see draws

(Chorus)
Girls, show your draws, cause its a party up in here
Fellas oh yo, lets make this whole room clear
Girls, show your draws, cause its a party up in here
Fellas oh yo, lets make this whole room clear

(Sincere)
I spit amazing, hot when I rap
I only spend stacks, cause baby got back
Shake that ass, and do what you wanna
Hoes run on me like I'm the number one stunna
When I walk in they started the stalkin
But let me mention, I like the attention
Grab they extension, and make that coochie pop
Shake it don't stop, drop it like its hot
Whisper in her ear, I got the big T.I.P
You gotta do more than whatchu do in V.I.P
Grab it, and shake it, and lick it around
If you do it kinda proper I might stick around
Slow down, hoe down, woe now
It's feelin good
Next day, guess whos on my two way
Janet Jackson, time for action

(Chorus)(2x)
Girls, show your draws, cause its a party up in here
Fellas oh yo, lets make this whole room clear
Girls, show your draws, cause its a party up in here
Fellas oh yo, lets make this whole room clear
