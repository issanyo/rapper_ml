[Hook: Jennifer Hudson]
You got me hypnotized
You got a look and a something money can’t buy
Walk it out with me
Walk it out with me, walk it out with me
I got you hypnotized
I got the staring and from the look in your eyes
You wanna walk it out with me
Walk it out with me, walk it out with me

[Verse 1: Jennifer Hudson Timbaland]
Hey baby, hey, hey hey hey hey
I just moved in to town
I’m lost, can you show me the way, way, way
If I can be with you, you can help me the other day, day, day
Honey excuse me mmm keep on working
If I didn't know no better, I’d think that you was flirting
Whispering sweet nothings in my ear
Working on all ‘em excuses to get up in here
And boy you talking good shit
And I swear that you could get it
I’m a good girl, I gotta think about my image
Show dignity, but I’m sorry
I’m not just anybody

You wanna walk it out with me
Walk it out with me, walk it out with me

Fuck it, let’s do this today

Take me to your room

But you gotta treat me like a lady
We should just get to know each other, yeah
And the man will go away-way-way
But now I’m on the first stand, yeah
