[Verse 1]
I think I'm better off not knowing
When you leave my bed, where you be goin'
It's obvious I ain't your only
But I ain't ready to be lonely
So this is not an ultimatum
Knew the rules to your games before I played 'em
You ain't even gotta mean it
But I still need to hear it

[Chorus]
Just tell me a lie, fool me babe
Tell me another lie
Baby you can start my saying (What you want me to do?)
Tell me that you love me baby
Tell me that you love me baby
Tell me that you love me baby (What you want me to do?)
Tell me that you love me baby
Tell me that you love me baby, tell me baby
Tell me that you love me baby, tell me baby
Tell me that you love me baby, tell me baby
Tell me that you love me, tell me you love me babe

[Verse 2]
I've been too afraid to ask this
Am I your main or your mistress?
I mean I'm happy all my bills are paid for
But whose else you doing the same for?
Do you give her more, or do you just appease me?
Do you please her the same ways you please me?
Even though your game is see-through
I just can't find the strength to leave


[Chorus]
(So tell me) tell me that you love me baby
Tell me that you love me baby
Tell me that you love me baby (What you want me to do?)
Tell me that you love me baby
(Just tell me a lie) Tell me that you love me baby (fool me baby)
Tell me that you love me baby (tell me another lie)
Tell me baby, tell me that you love me baby
Tell me baby, tell me that you love me, tell me you love me babe

[Bridge]
Even if there ain't no truth behind it (na na na na na na)
Baby I just need to be blinded (na na na na na na)
If your heart isn't in it, then baby don't tell me so
Fool me, if you don't want to lose me

[Chorus]
(What you want me to do?) Tell me that you love me baby
Tell me that you love me baby (what you want me to do?)
Tell me that you love me baby (what you want me to do?)
Tell me that you love me baby
Tell me that you love me baby, tell me baby
Tell me that you love me baby, tell me baby
Tell me that you love me baby, tell me baby
Tell me that you love me, tell me you love me babe
Tell me baby
