[Intro]
Listen, first you must travel a long dusty road
This road you shall travel will seem like nowhere
But that nowhere will turn into somewhere
Keep yo' head up Bubba, don't let no body getchya down
Cuz that you travel shall turn around, begin

[Kiley Dean]
Ahhhhhh ahhhhh
Ahhhehhhhahhh
Ohhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhehhhh
Ahhhhehhhohhhh
Nowhere, nowhere

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
I've accepted every challenge and risen to all occasions
The country boy done got 'em shook like Randy Moss and Jason
Perhaps all Bubba's numerals don't fit in y'alls equation
If yo' opinions coincide with that, you oughta save 'em
Cuz they groped, the greatest southern rapper fuckin period
Negative spirits, they only keep you down a myriad
Of Satan's substance is in my system, still my wisdom
Is never once compromised, that's between God and I
Never once forgotten my manners cuz my mama
Played in public housin, Opelika, Alabama
But she had a different plan for me, and Russ and Ginger
Thank the Lord for Jimmy Mathis Pops they must remember
How you held it down when them other clowns disappeared
Taught me how to seek to scope, shoot and leave with the deer
Then made me drink the blood to show me life was precious
The money rose from nowhere 'til somewhere here's my directions

[Hook 2x: Kiley Dean]
I know what it's like to be nowhere
I know what it's liiiiiike

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
Can you relate to five kids, six fish sticks on the plate
Or writin Santa Claus, I guess he got the list too late
Or to catch the fish you bait the hook with little Dylan's poo poo
On Mr. Allen's property, he catch you he will shoot you
Let these cats amuse you with comical depictions
But where I'm from bein broke's no honorable affliction
Love some Jimmy Carter, but we never ever voted
But slum is still slum, so you best believe we toted
Every firearm from AKs to thirty-thirties
And from live rocks to livestock, they pays the early birdy
Thus we worked the land like you worked the block with yayo
But I chose keys over cattle cuz the profits way mo'
Might get locked away though, peddlin' them snow cones
So we keep it simplified with acres of that homegrown
Plus the finest shine that you could find this side of Memphis
From east nowhere to west somewhere still the grind is endless

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
It all comes down to this, one last chance to advance
Be honest stinkin round up to big dance all my plans
Of bein viewed is somethin special, more than just the other one
Will vanish in the papers, all the plagues the south has suffered from
The worlds weight plus a ton restin on my shoulders
But what the trackers de my curse, is blessed to them, I hold a
Cuz Eminem's incredible, but then I really have to say this
For y'all to leave my soul at rest and add me to yo' play list
But this time I may just, leap and clear that hurtle man
Cuz it's gone be a million more, who knows if they'll be worth a damn
Bubba K I surely am, with that silky kind of sound
Carson tell yo' folks that I'll be early for this time around
Cuz I've come too far for my own mistakes to dwell me
Cuz lookin' back at self inflicted wounds and achin elmy
There's nothin they can tell me, get me somewhere in a hurry
If I'm nowhere then that nowhere be nowhere near a worry
Okey dokey..

[Hook] - 4X

{*Cry Me A River beat*}

[Timbaland]
You don't have to say what you did
Come on Ki and help me sing

[Kiley Dean]
Cry me a river Oh 5x
I know what it's like to be nowhere ehh
