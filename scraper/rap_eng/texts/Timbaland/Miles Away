[Verse 1]
I just woke up from a fuzzy dream
You never would believe the things that I have seen
I looked in the mirror and I saw your face
You looked right through me, you were miles away

[Pre-Chorus]
All my dreams, they fade away
I'll never be the same
If you could see me the way you see yourself
I can't pretend to be someone else

[Chorus]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

[Verse 2]
When no one is around, then I have you here
I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear
You always have the biggest heart
When we're six thousand miles apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Too much of no sound
Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough
When it's long distance love

[Chorus]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

[Bridge]
I'm alright, don't be sorry, but it's true
When I'm gone, you'll realize
That I'm the best thing that happened to you

[Breakdown]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away

[Chorus]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
