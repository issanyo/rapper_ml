Everybody hits the dance floor heat it up
Ladies put it down and take it up
Hit the dance floor and pick it up
Baby, put it down take it up
Everybody hits the dance floor and heat it up
Ladies put it down and take it up
Hit the dance floor and pick it up
Baby, put it down and throw it up!
We listen to cover girls
And now more than any I mess with cover girls of magazines
You can catch me on the cover, girl
I created my own planet, I hover the Earth and cover the world
I spit so thick I call it pearl
I see you tryna claim her now I play with her pearls
They try to comeback but they all stir
But I made her my girl
Now she does what I say, does what I please
Now more than any she lives on her knees
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Each with a buck and a quarter
Jill came back with $2.50. what a working girl
Now work it, girl! Like
Ah ah ah, (ah ah) - ah ah ah! (ah ah)
(Like) Ah ah ah, (ah ah) - ah ah ah! (ah ah)
Hey Girl, I like - when you do it
With all that Booty
Oh Oh my God
Hey Girl, I like - when you do it
With all that Booty
Oh Oh my God
Oh oh my god
Oh oh my god

(I like when you do it)
I love. when you. Make - a Pass At Me
A Pass at Me
A Pass at Me
I love. when you. Make - a Pass At Me
A Pass at Me

I love when I see your pretty ass on the floor
I like when I see you break it down
Like you in control
I got a cup in my right and a cup in my left
I'm stumbling and I'm out of breath
'Cause I'm gone. g-g-ggg-gone
'Cause I'm gone. g-g-ggg-gone
I got girls on my right, I got girls on my left
The one in the middle and I'm feeling on her breasts
'Cause I'm gone. g-g-ggg-gone
'Cause I'm gone. g-g-ggg-gone
Hey Girl, I like - when you do it
With all that Booty
Oh Oh my God
Hey Girl, I like - when you do it
With all that Booty
Oh Oh my God
Oh oh my god
Oh oh my god
Oh oh my god
(I like when you do it)
I love. when you. Make - a Pass At Me
A Pass at Me
A Pass at Me
I love. when you. Make - a Pass At Me
