Yeah!
Yeah!
Remember the time, baby, yeah!
I ain't got no money
I ain't got no car to take you on a date
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we be the perfect soul mates
Talk to me, girl
(Oh) baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta floss for me
If we go and touch, you can still touch my love it's free
We can work without the perks, just you and me
Thug it out till we get it right
Baby, if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
(I'm about to strip, and I want it quick
Can you handle me the way I are?)
I don't need the cheese or the car keys
Boy, I like you just the way you are
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like, I like, I like
I ain't got no Visa
I ain't got no Red American Express
We can't go nowhere exotic
It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best
Talk to me, girl
(Oh) baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta floss for me
If we go and touch, you can still touch my love it's free
We can work without the perks, just you and me
Thug it out till we get it right
Baby, if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
(I'm about to strip, and I want it quick
Can you handle me the way I are?)
I don't need the cheese or the car keys
Boy, I like you just the way you are
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
Baby girl, I don't got a huge ol' house; I rent a room in a house
Listen, baby girl, I ain't got a motorboat, but I can float ya boat
So listen, baby girl
Once you get a dose of D.O.E., you gon' want some mo'
So listen, baby girl
When I make it, I want you there, want you there, yeah
