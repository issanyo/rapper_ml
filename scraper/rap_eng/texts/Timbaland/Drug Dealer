[Intro]
King stays king baby

[Chorus]
She text a number to ma phone, I wonder what this shawty on
She gone give a dog a bone, but is that really what I want ?
She got that dope like a drug dealer
She got that dope like a drug dealer
I fuck with shawty with a mean ass
I just bought that pussy a celine bag

[Verse 1]
You love yo hoe but it don't matter
You asking questions get no answer
Ima kill that ass I promise
I gave that bitch the anaconda
Im tryna beat it like a drummer
I flew her out to cali for the summer
She say she love me even though a nigga used to hit her cousin
Ma niggas say i'm trippin I say fuck it I don't need a rubber
She got that dope like a drug dealer
She got that dope like a drug dealer
I'm faded off the weed and the liquor
You know i had to giver her ass the business i'm the realest nigga

[Chorus]
She text a number to ma phone, I wonder what this shawty on
She gone give a dog a bone, but is that really what I want ?
She got that dope like a drug dealer
She got that dope like a drug dealer
I fuck with shawty with a mean ass
I just bought that pussy a celine bag

[Verse 2]
She stand on top of couches with champagne bottles
She bad bitch but she hate models
I let her drive the D cause she remain cautious
They got the spotlight on us that's what fame got us
Designer got her busting like a chopper
She fine as fuck she got it from her momma
Throw it on the table and she help a nigga count up all the commas
She never answer when a nigga call her I don't want no problems
She got that dope like a drug dealer
She got that dope like a drug dealer
I love the money I can't fall in love with ya
That's what fucking with a thug gets u

[Chorus]
She text a number to ma phone, I wonder what this shawty on
She gone give a dog a bone, but is that really what I want ?
She got that dope like a drug dealer
She got that dope like a drug dealer
I fuck with shawty with a mean ass
I just bought that pussy a celine bag
