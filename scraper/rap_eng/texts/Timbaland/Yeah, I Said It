[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I ain't tryna think about it, no
Yeah, I said it, boy, get up inside it
I want you to homicide it
Go in slow, but I want you to pipe it
And I think I kinda like ya
Up against the wall, we don't need a title

[Chorus]
Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, bae
Yeah, I said it, man, fuck a title

[Verse 2]
Boy, I always like to show
Get a little bit, come a little close, now
Take it home on your camera phone
Get a little bad, nigga, watch me blow it down

[Chorus]
Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, bae
Yeah, I said it
Oooohh
Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, bae
Yeah, I said it
Ooooh

[Bridge]
You can be rough, boy, but you won't
Give me some love, boy, give it to me 'til the morn'

[Chorus]
Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, babe
Yeah, I said it, uh
Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, babe
Yeah, I said it
