[Intro: Charlamagne Tha God]
A wise man told me the first step towards change is awareness, the second step is acceptance
Are you aware of the changes that are happening around you? Are you willing to accept the change that is upon us?

[Tink]
Cash rules everything around me
Tell them broke boys get the fuck from 'round me
Once it comes it comes, when it leaves it leaves
You ain't 'bout that life, you can't roll with me, no no

[Charlamagne Tha God]
Time for a shift, a metamorphosis, a modification, a difference

[Tink]
Once it comes it comes, when it leaves it leaves
You ain't 'bout that life, you can't roll with me, no

[Verse 1: Tink]
Money talks and these bitches is mighty quiet
I hear these niggas woofing, I kill 'em with dead silence
I could reply but there's really no need for payback
My papers just as long as the legroom inside the Maybach
They hate it
Won't find me in no club unless I'm gon' be compensated
Spot right on the beach so when I'm home I'm on vacation
Fuck you doing? Why you never happy?
If that man ain't get the check then that nigga just don't attract me
I'm more into the ballers, don't look at me like I'm Draya
I spend it and I waste it, it's plenty more left for later
These boys can't hang with my clique
You know I keep a bankroll, that won't fold, the same sizes, they dick
I'm in a playful ass mood, you gotta pay for this ride
I make a scene and when I leave, I make 'em stand like the bride
Let's get these rappers on the alter, better pray while they can
I'm comin' heavy as a pound, these niggas still on the gram
I get a kick out of doin' business and living life
You getta' kick outta fuckin' bitches with hella' likes

[Hook: Tink]
We in a different state of mind
I ain't never heard the word declined
All I think about is time
I need it around the clock
I need it around the clock

[Interlude: Charlamagne]
I want you to think Tink
If you not thinking Tink then I'ma say you not thinking
And If you not thinking Tink  then I don't wanna know what you thinking because there's nothing else worth thinking about
Life doesn't get better by chance, it get's better by change

[Verse 2: Tink]
I don't give a fuck about no gossip, they whispering who's better
Man I'm at these niggas throats, and that shit goes for whoever
I'm hoping you get it twisted, don't care if you feel offended
I know that you heard my name, I'm just waiting for you to diss it (Oh yes)
I'ma blow right at your top, John Kennedy
Nothin' I hate more than a nigga with bitch tendencies
That's like 99% of y'all
I tell these niggas bow their heads like I was rappin' out the synagogue
Yahweh pockets on grande
Make him put his face next to my waist and he got down like my fianc√©e
Shit was 'bout an hour
I need a nigga with some power, movin' forward, Dwight Howard
That's the party, we rollin' like a Harley
I showed up with them bands so every nigga in this club came tardy

[Hook]

[Charlamagne Tha God]
That change will make your life better is here
Time for a shift
Tink spit that ghetto gospel

[Outro]
Cash rules everything around me
Tell them broke boys get the fuck from 'round me
Once it comes it comes, when it leaves it leaves
You ain't 'bout that life, you can't roll with me, no no
Cash rules everything around me
It's like he know I'ma be nothin' without it
Once it comes it comes, when it leaves it leaves
You ain't 'bout that life, you can't roll with me, no no
No, no, no
I need it around the clock
I need it
I need it around the clock
