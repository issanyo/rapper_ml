[Verse 1: Bre-Z]
They tell me if you really want it that bad
You gonna get it
So you know I'll be writing rhymes forever
But since a younging I'll be on but never
Had a time to shine
These people hate what they don't know manipulating my grind
I played the bench applying pressure from the sidelines
Never gave a damn about a hater trying to take mine
I was my own boss always took my own law
Solid as a rock but when I flip I took my own fall
They asked that,"How you do that baby?"
I'm whiling on the block like,"Why you do that baby?"
They wonder how I move like, "How you do that lady?"
Had the baddest by my side they can move that baby
Uh, She don't move for nothing always the money
When they scheme I wasn't gone people thought it was funny(thought it was funny)
Uh, they say,"You really want it that bad? Just think of all the stuff you never had!"

[Chorus: Bre-Z]
And if you really want it that bad, you gonna get it
So I probably sing this song forever, but never mind the weather
Take a ride and get my mind together
I got a diamond I'mma shine forever
And if you really want it that bad, you gonna get it
So I probably sing this song forever
But never mind the weather
Take a ride and get my mind together
I got a diamond I'mma shine forever

[Verse 2: Bre-Z]
Right, I know that she gon' pop that's what they used to say
But back to the block what the future say
Back to the spot, with the kitchen in the pot
Baking soda till it rock while you listen and you watch
Only younging out my gunto ever write a rhyme
In the booth like everyday, I'm dreaming bout what99
One time they stole my book, why would you study mine
I'm sorry hater I won't tell them how I plan to shine
95 that North side see me in Delaware
People die and boots fly my people heavy there
Shook nine we all the way live we born crooks
What I'm saying
You ain't walking with God I promise your soul get soaked
Scrape up chains like here and theres
Sometimes I had to move that green to grab that pair
Why these women say,"They don't like me"
Eh, they wanna fight me
A hater's watching they women they thinking I'm hitting I'm probably

[Chorus 2: Bre-Z]
If you really want it that bad, you gonna get it
So I probably sing this song forever
But since a younging I been on but never
At the time to shine
Manipulating my grind

[Bridge: Bre-Z]
Told these haters how I do it
Like how I move it
They love the focus, they love the way I pursue it
Had to do my own thing
I'm gonna make my own lair
Always be a winner because I'm playing at my own, yeah!

[Chorus: Bre-Z]
And if you really want it that bad, you gonna get it
So I probably sing this song forever, but never mind the weather
Take a ride and get my mind together
I got a diamond I'mma shine forever
And if you really want it that bad, you gonna get it
So I probably sing this song forever
But never mind the weather
Take a ride and get my mind together
I got a diamond I'mma shine forever

[Interlude: Bre-Z]
You can't dim the lights
And now its time to shine
And all that's in me
Together we can go
You trying to knock me down
But I already knocked the ground
And it's my time, and you can't take what's mine

[Chorus: Bre-Z]
And if you really want it that bad, you gonna get it
So I probably sing this song forever, but never mind the weather
Take a ride and get my mind together
I got a diamond I'mma shine forever
And if you really want it that bad, you gonna get it
So I probably sing this song forever
But never mind the weather
Take a ride and get my mind together
I got a diamond I'mma shine forever
