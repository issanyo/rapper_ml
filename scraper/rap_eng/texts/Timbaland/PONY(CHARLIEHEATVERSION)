[Intro]
G-g-g-good work, Charlie

[Verse 1: Ginuwine]
I'm just a bachelor
I'm looking for a partner
Someone who knows how to ride without even falling off
Gotta be compatible takes me to my limits
Girl when I break you off
I promise that you won't wanna get...

[Chorus: Ginuwine]
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it

[Verse 2: Ginuwine]
Sitting here flossing
Peeping your steelo
Just once if I have the chance
The things I would do to you
You and your body, every single portion
Send chills up and down your spine
Juices flowing down your thigh

[Chorus: Ginuwine]
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it

[Verse 3: Ginuwine]
If we're gonna get nasty baby
First, we'll show and tell
Till I reach your pony tail, oh
Lurk all over and through you baby
Until we reach the stream
You'll be on my jockey team, yeah ooh oh

[Chorus: Ginuwine]
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it

[Outro]
Good work
