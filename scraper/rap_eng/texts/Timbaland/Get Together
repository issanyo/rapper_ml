[Verse 1]
I got red and blue lights
I hand picked the guys
The girls were on their way
Helpin' me fix up the place
A brand new outfit
I can't wait to get in
The doorbell's ringin'
9 0'clock let's get it started

[Chorus]
I'm not havin' a party
I'm havin' a get together
That's when we get together
And we do whatever
I'm not havin' a party
I'm havin' a get together
That's when we get together
No plans
Whatever's clever

[Verse 2]
I play selected tunes
Dictate the mood
Don't be too cool
To kick off your shoes
The music can't be loud
'Cause we can't hear what we're talkin' about
I am in chill mode
Just loungin' with my folks

If you name it we'll do it
If you want it we'll get it
Make sure you don't miss it
I know you'll regret it
And you'll never forget it
I'm takin' pictures
Bring somebody with ya
You know I'm not trippin'

[Chorus]
I'm not havin' a party
I'm havin' a get together
That's when we get together
And we do whatever
I'm not havin' a party
I'm havin' a get together
That's when we get together
No plans
Whatever's clever

[Verse 3]
No special occasion
Just good conversation
I'm just havin' fun
'Cause I'm always on the run
I don't need no reason
'Cause it's always in the season
It's pleasing to relax; we'll just enjoy ourselves

[Chorus]
I'm not havin' a party
I'm havin' a get together
That's when we get together
And we do whatever
I'm not havin' a party
I'm havin' a get together
That's when we get together
No plans
Whatever's clever
