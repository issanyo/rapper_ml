[Verse 1: Madysyn Rose and CRAVETAY]
I could be the President
I could be the very first lady
I could wear Timberlands
Rock a sundress real lazy
Nobody, nobody, nobody, no
Can tell me different
Nobody, nobody, nobody, no
(Ooh, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Ashlund Jade and CRAVETAY (All)]
I'm doing me no matter where I'm at (do you)
Nothing in the world could ever hold me back
You don't have to live in yesterday
You can be brand new every day
Let it out, go and ride the wave
(Girl!)

[Chorus: All with Ashlund Jade]
Be who you wanna be, huh
Dress like you wanna, talk like you wanna
Be who you wanna be, huh
Do what you wanna, say what you wanna
Go tell 'em, tell those haters see you later
Be who you wanna be, huh
Be who you wanna be

[Verse 2: CRAVETAY]
I could be sugar sweet
Or I could switch up the flavor
I could keep it nice and clean
Or I can be a troublemaker
Nobody, nobody, nobody, no
Can tell me different
Nobody, nobody, nobody, no
(Ooh, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Ashlund Jade (All)]
I'm doing me no matter where I'm at (do you)
Nothing in the world could ever hold me back
You don't have to live in yesterday
You can be brand new every day
Let it out, go and ride the wave
(Girl!)

[Chorus: All with Ashlund Jade]
Be who you wanna be, huh
Dress like you wanna, talk like you wanna
Be who you wanna be, huh
Do what you wanna, say what you wanna
Go tell 'em, tell those haters see you later (bye!)
Be who you wanna be, huh
Be who you wanna be

[Bridge: CRAVETAY and Ashlund Jade (All)
Tell those haters see you later
(Go tell 'em), oh, (go tell 'em)
Tell those haters see you later
(Go tell 'em), yeah, (go tell 'em)
(Girl!)

[Chorus: All with Ashlund Jade]
Be who you wanna be, huh
Dress like you wanna, talk like you wanna
Be who you wanna be, huh
Do what you wanna, say what you wanna
Go tell 'em, tell those haters see you later (bye!)
Be who you wanna be, huh
Be who you wanna be
