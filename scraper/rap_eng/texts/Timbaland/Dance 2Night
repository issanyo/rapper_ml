[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Hey Madonna, I'm going to take you to the club, go!
Uh, feels good, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Madonna & Justin Timberlake]
Move your body, catch me from across the floor
Everybody's watching, but I just wanna give you more
Don't care about nothing
I've fallen for your love in the worst way
So move closer, 'cause I can feel your body rise
The heat from you, and I just have to fantasize
We're all alone now
And I don't care what people have to say

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna & Justin Timberlake]
You don't have to be beautiful to be understood
You don't have to be rich and famous to be good
You just gotta give more, more, more
Than you ever have before
And you gotta move fast, fast, fast
If you want this good thing to last

[Chorus: Madonna & Justin Timberlake]
Let's dance tonight, dance tonight
And prove ourselves to the world
And we'll hold hands tonight, hands tonight
(I'm just a boy and you're just a girl)
I wanna dance tonight, dance tonight
Don't need no diamonds and pearls
So take a chance tonight, chance tonight
Let's prove ourselves to the world

[Post-Chorus: Madonna & Justin Timberlake]
Do it, do it, let me turn you on
Let the music pull you through it 'til the break of dawn
Do it, do it, while the night is young
Let the music pull you through it 'til the lights go on

[Verse 2: Madonna & Justin Timberlake]
Now we're in our zone
Do you wanna take it further?
And before too long
I'm gonna start to wonder
Are you a one trick pony
Or do you wanna keep running this race?
I'm so into you
I've heard it all before
So what should I do?
I told you, catch me on the floor
Don't spoil this moment
Cause talk is cheap, I don't have time to waste

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna & Justin Timberlake]
You don't have to be beautiful to be understood
You don't have to be rich and famous to be good
You just gotta give more, more, more
Than you ever have before
And you gotta move fast, fast, fast
If you want this good thing to last

[Chorus: Madonna & Justin Timberlake]
Let's dance tonight, dance tonight
And prove ourselves to the world
And we'll hold hands tonight, hands tonight
(I'm just a boy and you're just a girl)
I want to dance tonight, dance tonight
Don't need no diamonds and pearls
So take a chance tonight, chance tonight
Let's prove ourselves to the world

[Post-Chorus: Madonna & Justin Timberlake]
Do it, do it, let me turn you on
Let the music pull you through it 'til the break of dawn
Do it, do it, while the night is young
Let the music pull you through it 'til the lights go on

[Outro: Madonna & Justin Timerlake]
Dance, dance, dance
Do you want to take it further?
Just dance
Cat-cat-cat-catch me on the floor
Cat-cat-cat-catch me on the floor
Cat-cat-cat-catch me on the floor
