[Verse 1: Usher]
Every time I look at you
There's so many things that I want to do
I promise you when I'm ready
That I'll spend my life with you
What is love, is it steady?
'Cause I don't know what to do
So tell me, girl, are you ready
To do what we came to do?

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
One day we could be together
Cause you know that I wanna be down, baby
But right now, we can all forget it
You know I gots to get around
I don't have much money (don't have no money)
I can't buy a diamond ring (can't buy a diamond thing)
I ain't trying to be funny (funny)
It's only a sexual thing (only a sexual thing)

[Chorus: Usher]
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring

[Verse 2: Usher]
Please forgive me
'Cause I don't ever want to rush you
I might sound a little hasty
But let's do what we came to do
You know our time is really precious
And you wasted a lot of mine
I'm gonna have to keep on moving
If you can't make up your mind

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
One day we could be together
Cause you know that I wanna be down, baby
But right now, we can all forget it
You know I gots to get around
I don't have much money (don't have none)
I can't buy a diamond ring (and a diamond ring)
I ain't trying to be funny (no)
It's only a sexual thing

[Chorus: Usher]
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring

[Bridge: DeVante Swing & Usher]
(Baby, do you want to get with it?
I know that you want to)
Yeah, check me out
Yo, watch this
DeVante, say it again
(Can you get with it
With it)

[Chorus: Usher]
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I...
