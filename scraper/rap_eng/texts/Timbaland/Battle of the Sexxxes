[Intro: Timbaland + Justin Timberlake]
Don't hurt her Justin!
That was the past
Put it all behind you, homeboy
Let me talk to you
Let me, let me talk to you
I just, I just wanna talk to you
Let me, let me, let me talk to you
I just wanna talk to you
Is it alright if I talk to you?
Just listen

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Baby girl, don't be afraid
I know you remember me, I'm your boy from back in the day
I heard you singin' you're back, and your mind seems right
And I can't even lie to you, your body still drives me wild

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
So don't be afraid to get nasty
Don't be afraid to get wild
Just point to your spot and ask me
I'll make it worth your while
Don't be afraid to get nasty
Don't be afraid to get wild
Just point to your spot and ask me
I'll make it worth your while

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Let's explore explicit
Let's express reflexes
Exploit your pleasure
It's the battle of the sexxxes
Let's explore explicit
Let's express reflexes
Exploit your pleasure
It's the battle of the sexxxes

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Talk to me
Make it talk to me
Talk to me
Make it talk to me
Talk to me
Make it talk to me
Talk to me
Make

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Baby boy, I know you want my love
Already gave you a hit so you know that it's like a drug
You remember my flavor, you still know my taste
I still got it, baby, it'd be a shame if it went to waste

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
So don't be afraid to get nasty
Don't be afraid to get wild
Just point to your spot and ask me
I'll make it worth your while
Don't be afraid to get nasty
Don't be afraid to get wild
Just point to your spot and ask me
I'll make it worth your while

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Let's explore explicit
Let's express reflexes
Exploit your pleasure
It's the battle of the sexxxes
Let's explore explicit
Let's express reflexes
Exploit your pleasure
It's the battle of the sexxxes

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Talk to me
Make it talk to me
Talk to me
Make it talk to me
Talk to me
Make it talk to me
Talk to me
Make
