[Spoken: Static Major]
Heh-he, yeah
You want me to say your name, right?
Alright, uh, uh

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) You better say my name
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) Cause something feels strange
(Ain't nothin' goin' on. What you mean? Yeah)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) I'm filing a complaint
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) I'm just asking you to say my name

[Verse: Kelly & Static Major]
(Hey what's up yo?)
See usually when I call you
You say "Hey baby", oh
(What'cha talking 'bout)
But now this time
You're only mumbling to me, oh yeah
(You can't hear me, alright)
I know it ain't me
Something seems funny
(Naw, ain't nothing going on)
So tell me now
Forever, hold your peace
(Tell you what? What'cha talking bout?)
Is that a girl I hear next to you, ooh?
(Ah ah, nobody here)
Don't make me come and crash your party, baby
(Na-uh don't do that)
The game is on so I know you ain't leaving, leaving
(It's almost over, it's almost over though)
I'm on my way, unless I hear you say 'baby'
(Hold on, hold on, don't come, don't come)

[Chorus: Kelly, Destiny's Child, & Static Major]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, you better say my name)
You better say my name (What you mean "Say my name?")
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, cause something feels strange)
Cause something feels strange
(Something like what? You ain't going out, girl)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm filing a complaint)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm just asking you to say my name)
(Alright)

[Verse: Beyoncé & Timbaland:]
Oh!
(Yo, what you doing later?)
Why does it feel like you're trying to rush me?
(Now you know I wouldn't do that to you, girl. C'mon, now)
And don't leave the room, yo, I hear it getting quiet, oh yeah
(I know you still hear that T.V. in the background. C'mon, now)
I still remember when they tried to warn me
(Oh, your girls tried to warn you? Alright)
So tell the truth I wish you'd quit trying to play these game, oh
(You trippin', now)
It's about to be over if I can't come over
(You can come in a little while, not right now though)
Boy, you must think I'm a fool or something
(No, I think you're the smartest girl in the world. C'mon, now)
Listen at your voice, see you're sounding shady
(I sound calm like I always do, what's up?)
Then prove it to me and let me hear you say my name, oh
(I'm saying it now)

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Destiny's Child]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, you better say my name)
Say my name, say my name, say my name, say my name
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, cause something feels strange)
Say my name, what's my name, say my name
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm filing a complaint)
Baby, say my, baby, say my name, ooh
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm just asking you to say my name)

[Bridge: Destiny's Child]
Say my name
Something ain't the same
Yo, I'm in pain
Boy, you've been acting kind of strange
Say my name
Something done changed
I'm not insane, I'm waiting for you to explain
Say my name
Something ain't the same
Yo, I'm in pain
Yo, you've been acting kind of strange
Say my name, save the games
I'm just asking you to say my name

[Interlude: Timbaland & Beyoncé]
(What I'm gonna do right now, babe, is get off this phone, 'cause I see you trippin' right now)
Yeah, yeah, e-yeah, yeah
(I'ma give you some time to yourself)
(Let you think a lil' bit)
Yeah, yeah, e-yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, e-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I hope you're changing your mind right about now)

[Outro: Beyoncé]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kind of shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
Say my name, yeah
Say my name, say my name
