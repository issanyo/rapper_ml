I get over heels for someone, I
That I really can't deal with, deal with
I want to block her out my mind
But I really can't do it, do it
I tell myself this the last time
I'ma let her do this to me
Whenever we do spend time
I realize that I can't get enough of you
Wipe that smile off your **** face, let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your face, let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your **** face, let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your face
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
To be inside, I don't care
Right in the middle, I'm right in the middle
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
To be inside, I don't care
Be my unholy, my one and my lonely
If I could start with words 'cause it's the only hope of feasting I got left
And everything I love about you is a mess
Smash the mirror and break the palm in his hand
I want to be better than I am
Let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your **** face, let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your face, let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your **** face, let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your face
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
To be inside, I don't care
Right in the middle, I'm right in the middle
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
To be inside, I don't care
Be my unholy, my one and my lonely
Girl, just look what you've done
How could you do this to me?
I gotta put my foot down
I can't let you do this to me
I can't forget those good ole times
And all the things you've been doing to me
I wanna hit that one more time
I mean love, what you're doing to me
I'ma say it loud, right here
Let's **** in this crowd
Why we arguing
I thought me and you were supposed to be friends
Let's chill for minute
Better yet we need a heal for a minute
Baby, put down the knife
Sometime I wanna save ya life, why don't you
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
To be inside, I don't care
Right in the middle, I'm right in the middle
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
To be inside, I don't care
Be my unholy, my one and my lonely
We ain't got no *** band
We ain't got no stinking the *** microphone setter
Timbaland, you tuned in, son of a b***
Let's get this f*** out of my house now
Before I get to my and I can't turn back
Hey, didn't I say you to f*** out
Get the f*** out
