Is it going, is it going, is it going, is it going?
I don't know what you're looking for

I'm the type of girl that'll look you dead in the eye, eye
I'm real as they comes if you don't know why I'm fly-y-y
Seen you try to switch it up but girl you ain't got to
I'm a wonder woman let me go get my ropes

I'm a supermodel and mummy, si, mummy
Amnesty international got bankrupt, I'm on top, on lock
You love my ass and my abs in the video called promiscuous
My style is meticulous-s-s

If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

When Timbo is in the party everybody put up their hands
I get a half a mil for my beats, you get a couple grand-d-d
Never gonna see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from California way down to Japan

I'm a real producer and you just the piano man
Your song gonna top the charts, I heard 'em, I'm not a
Fan-n-n
Talkin' greasy I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell 'em t-t-they can't do it like I can

If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

Could you speak up and stop the m-m-mumbling
I don't think you're getting clear
Sitting on the top it's hard to hear you from way up here
I saw you tryin' to act cute on TV just let me clear the air
We missed you on the charts last week

Damn, that's right, you wasn't there
If s-s-sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shit-t-t?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So, if you see us in the club go on and walk the other way
'Cuz our run will never be over, not at least until we say

If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
