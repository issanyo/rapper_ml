[Verse 1]
Oooh, oooh, hmmm
Love is lost, where is it to be found?
My heart is still here and we have to go 'round and 'round
And all the time I was loving you faithfully
And you took my love and you turned it around on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, I don't wanna fight with you
I've done everything I can do (everything I can do)
Don't you leave me like that, I just want my girl back
Can we work it out, or is it over?

[Chorus]
(What are we doin'?) What are we doin'?
Why can't we seem to work things out
(What are we doin'?) What are we doin'?
Did we forget what love was about?
(It feels like I'm losing)Feels like I'm losing
But when that was everything to me
But now I realize we are just better not together

[Verse 2]
It's hard to let go
Girl we've been through so many things
But for you to grow, it had to go and spread your wings
I see your tears, you're searching for a brighter day
Oh, you should've thought it through when you gave my love away

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, I don't wanna fight with you
I've done everything I can do (everything I can do)
I hate to leave you like that but I thought you had my back
We tried to work it out but it's over

[Chorus]
(What are we doin'?) What are we doin'?
Why can't we seem to work things out (It was you and me together)â€¨(What are we doin'?) What are we doin'?
Did we forget what love was about?
(It feels like I'm losing) Feels like I'm losing
But when that was everything to me
But now I realize we are just better not together

[Bridge]
Girl it's just too much for me to say, for you to tell me that you love me
And then to watch you walk away
But girl the way we fight, it just ain't right
That's why it's better this way (hehey hehey yeah yeah yeah)
Now no what else to say, but girl you know that
(I) I (still) still (love) love (you) you (yeah) Yeaaah

[Chorus]
(What are we doin'?) What are we doin'?
Why can't we seem to work things out
(What are we doin'?) What are we doin'?
Did we forget what love was about? (Come on baby!)
(It feels like I'm losing) Feels like I'm losing
But when that was everything to me
But now I realize we are just better not together
I've realized we are just better not together
