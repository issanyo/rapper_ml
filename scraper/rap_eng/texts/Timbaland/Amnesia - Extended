Here we go

Staring at me, scratching your head with that bewildered look on your face
You don't quite seem to recollect, it's as if there isn't a trace
Of all the reasons that I got you babe
All the ways you've done me wrong
Maybe I can't drive your memory
By the time I'm done with this song

You're a liar, a cheat, unfaithful don (unfaithful don)
You throw away all our love and trust (love and trust)
It's so hard to see just who you are
You've been tricking with them before
Amnesia

I, I think you got me all wrong, girl
Amnesia
I think, I think you got me all wrong
Amnesia
I, I think you got me all wrong, girl
Amnesia
I think you got me all wrong

I know that you'd rather forget all of the pain you caused me inside
You need a good reality check, that's why I'm walking out of your life
So all the images start flashing back and the picture is restored
Let me resurrect your solid past 'til there ain't no dying anymore

You're a liar, a cheat, unfaithful don (unfaithful don)
You throw away all our love and trust (love and trust)
It's so hard to see just who you are
You've been tricking with them before
Amnesia

She said I got amnesia
No cards girl, I'm no reader
That dress make me believe her
Don't cheat yourself if I treat ya
She's striding like a diva
Got a glimpse, go out for her features
I got approval from all my people
Is she the one, is she a keeper?
Cause you never know our love baby
Must be messin with them lames baby
I can be what they ain't baby
Get a taste of this fame, baby, baby!
Oh no, you got me
I never cheat, not me
Don't get left out alone
I think you got me all wrong

You're a liar, a cheat, unfaithful don (unfaithful don)
You throw away all our love and trust (love and trust)
It's so hard to see just who you are
You've been tricking with them before
Amnesia

I, I think you got me all wrong, girl
(I think that I don't)
I think, I think you got me all wrong
(You're playing your first)
I wouldn't do you like that
(Yes, yes you would)
I think you got me all wrong, girl
(No)
I think you got me all wrong, girl
(I think that I don't)
I think, I think you got me all wrong
(You're playing your first)
I wouldn't do you like that
(Yes, yes you would)
I think you got me all wrong, girl

Amnesia
