You know ya'll been waiting but

[Pre-Verse: Timbaland]
Hey girl

I bet you I talk you right out out out them them them them Drawers
I bet you I take you right out out them them them them Drawers
Hey JT, sing that shit, as I.... pause

[Verse 1]
I was a boxer til I knocked that out
I played a doctor til I made that house... Call
I had a shy little quiet girl but now she sings opera loud
But my train is on yo track now
So watch out

[Bridge]
With the music in the lights in the middle of the night
I’m gettin’ my way like a kid in a candy store
I think you got what I want
And by the end of the night when you hot like a light
It'll be cause you and me burned up the floor
And if you're on what I'm on, then you already know, c'mon

[Hook]
Help me I’m going down
That’s what I hear her say
Baby my body count
Is blowing up all the way, hey
Sign up, put your name down
Make my body count
Make my body count
Make my body count

[Pre-Verse - Timbaland]

[Verse 2]
That’s what I’m talkin’ bout
Waitress til she got that tip
Sailor until I sunk that ship
Yeah I had a hot little fire girl
But now she just smoke that’s it
And I ain’t gon stop til I get you out on top of this list

[Bridge]
