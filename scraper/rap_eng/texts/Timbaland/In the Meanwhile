[DeVante]
Sticky, sticky, let's get sticky, word
Yeah, I like it

[Jo-Jo]
In the mirror

[DeVante]
Can you pose in the mirror baby, get sticky

[Jo-Jo]
I don't have to be the only one
But we can still have fun
Till the rising sun
As long as you with me
Baby don't diss me
And we can get busy
I know you have a lot to do
But can I get a second or two
So when you get with me
I can spin you around and we can get busy

[Hook x4]
You know I'm down to make you smile
So I'll be around in the meanwhile

[DeVante x2]
1- How you want it (Sticky)
How you like it (Sticky)
How you love it (Sticky)
How you need it (Sticky)

[Jo-Jo]
You say you wanna do a lot of things
So check the joy I bring
Baby you can hang
If you wanna feel sexy
Baby just call me
And we can get nasty
Come out cha' clothes and play for awhile
Come to my crib and check my style
So baby let me pour you found, in the meanwhile, in the meanwhile

[Hook x4]

[Timbaland & DeVante talking]
Yo DeVante, (Yo what)
This girl tried to get sticky with me, word up
And guess what I told her, (What's that) Timbaland

[Timbaland]
I can rock a party, like Liberace
I can catch a groupie, and all the hotties
Take her out and get sticky right in the lobby
Then get my crew and run a Swing Mobbie
We like Norman, our skills are the bait/Bate
People can't wait to get a dub of our tape
On a hundred-and-twenty-fifth, catch a whiff
K-Ci my man won't cha' hit a riff (Ooooh)
And show the sticky girls with the after
Rub her down, lick her thighs, now we Casper

[Jodeci]
All night long, keep you smilin'
All night long, get buck wylin'
All night long, make it sticky
All night long, we're not naked

F-feels, f-f-feels
F-feels, f-f-feels so damn
F-feels, f-f-feels
F-feels, f-f-feels so damn
F-feels, f-f-feels, h-how you want it, h-how you want it
F-feels, f-f-feels so damn, h-how you want it, h-how you want it sticky
F-feels, f-f-feels, h-how you want it, h-how you want it
F-feels, f-f-feels so damn, h-how you want it, h-how you want it sticky

[Hook x4]

[Repeat 1 x2]

[Jodeci]
You know I'm down, in the meanwhile

You know I'm down to make you smile
You know I'm down to make you smile
You know I'm down to make you smile

You know I'm down to make you smile
So I'll be around in the meanwhile
