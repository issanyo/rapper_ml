[Verse 1]
I walked all around
Like nine thousand miles
I lost all them pounds for you
And it cost every dime
I lost all my mind for you, for you
And I can't find my way at all
Lost the map to your heart
Now you're waiting for me somewhere all alone
Tell me how does it feel?
You don't know what you lost
Do you? Do you?

[Pre-Chorus]
You keep trying, you keep trying, you keep trying... Don't stop
You keep crying, you deny it, but you lying a lot
Boy you dying. Boy you dying, if you like it or not
It's on you, it's on you
(Check it out now baby)

[Chorus]
Who's the loser now?
(Check it out now baby)
Who's the loser now?
(Check it out now baby)
You look stupid now. In the lost and found
(Check it out now baby)
Who's the loser now?
(Check it out now baby)
Who's the loser now?
(Check it out now baby)
You look stupid now. In the lost and found
Who got you now?

[Verse 2]
You walked all around, ten thousand miles
You've looked everywhere for me
Then you lost all your smiles
And I think that's kinda funny, to me. (yeah)
And you don't hardly know where you're supposed to go
No sights on the road for you
Damn you lost all your hope
And that kinda blows for you, for you

[Pre-Chorus]
You keep trying, you keep trying, you keep trying... to stop
You keep crying, you denying, but you lying a lot
Boy you dying. Boy you dying, if you like it or not
It's on you, it's on you
(Check it out now baby)

[Chorus]
Who's the loser now?
(Check it out now baby)
Who's the loser now?
(Check it out now baby)
You look stupid now. The lost and found
(Check it out now baby)
Who's the loser now?
(Check it out now baby)
Who's the loser now?
(Check it out now baby)
You look stupid now. The lost and found
Who got you now?

[Bridge]
Who got you now? Got you now?
Who got you now? Got you now?
Who got you now? Got you now?
Who got you now? Got you now?

[Chorus]
Who's the loser now?
(Check it out now baby)
Who's the loser now?
(Check it out now baby)
You look stupid now. The lost and found
(Check it out now baby)
Who's the loser now?
(Check it out now baby)
Who's the loser now?
(Check it out now baby)
You look stupid now. The lost and found
Who got you now?

[Outro]
Who got you now? Got you now?
Who got you now? Got you now?
Who got you now? Got you now?
Who got you now? Got you now?
Who got you now? Got you now?
Who got you now? Got you now?
Who got you now? Got you now?
Who got you now? Got you now?
