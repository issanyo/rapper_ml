Intro:
A dream is a wish your heart makes when you're fast asleep
A dream is a something something, some something something something something, good night

Oh oh.... Oh oh....
Whoa, oh

Verse 1:
This the time
When you tell the truth, tell the truth, don't tell these lies
I know the real reason why you can't pick up that phone
So what you talking 'bout, you left that shit at home, ohh
So baby

Chorus:
Baby, call my name out loud (Baby, won't you call my name)
If there is no one around your heart (your heart)
I know all your games (I know all your games)
Baby call my name out loud Ã—2
(Call my name out loud and baby)
(baby call my name)

Verse 2:
Now baby
Don't be acting like I'm just a friend, no fool
Cause all them times we lay, you know that isn't true
Say I'm not thinking straight, baby call my name out loud
Oh, oh

Verse 3:
Aye
And then you text and say "my love's for you"
But if I can't hear your voice, how the hell I know it's true
Tired of all your games, won't you say my name out loud
Ohh Baby

Chorus:
(Call my name out loud baby)
(If there is no one around your heart)
(I know all your games)
(Won't you call that shit, go on call that shit, go on call that shit)
(Name out loud)
(call that shit, c-c-call that shit, go on call that shit)

Outro:
Call it, call it, call it, call it, call it, call it, call it, call my name
Won't you say it, call it, speak it, let me know it's all about me
Won't you call it, call it, caught up in your game boy
Won't you say it
