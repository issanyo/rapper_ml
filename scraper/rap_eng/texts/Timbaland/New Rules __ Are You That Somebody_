[Intro: Matt and Kevin]

[Verse 1: Scott (Mitch)]
Talking in my sleep at night, making myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hoping it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

[Interlude: Scott (Mitch)]
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, (so I tell myself), so I tell myself,  (I tell myself),  I tell myself,  (I tell myself)

[Pre-Chorus: Scott]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him

[Chorus: Kirstin and Mitch]
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
Are you that somebody?
Tell me are you that somebody?
I've got new rules, I count 'em
Are you that somebody?
I've gotta tell them to myself

[Verse 2: Scott (Kirstin)]
I keep pushing forwards, but he keeps pulling me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, nowhere to turn)
Now I'm standing back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, whoa)

[Interlude: Scott (Kirstin)]
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, (so I tell myself), I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

[Pre-Chorus: Scott]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him

[Chorus: Kirstin and Mitch]
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
Are you that somebody?
Tell me are you that somebody?
I've got new rules, I count 'em
Are you that somebody?
I've gotta tell them to myself (Hey!)

[Hook: Scott, Mitch and Kirstin]
If I let you know
You can't tell nobody
I'm talking 'bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy, I gotta watch my back
'Cause I'm not just anybody

[Pre-Chorus: Scott]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him

[Chorus; Kirstin, Scott and Mitch]
I got new rules, I count 'em
Yeah, oh (Are you that somebody?)
(Tell me are you that somebody?)
I've got new rules, I count 'em, baby (yeah, oh)
He's drunk and alone, so
(Are you that somebody?)
Don't pick up the phone
(Tell me are you that somebody?)
I've got new rules, I count 'em
