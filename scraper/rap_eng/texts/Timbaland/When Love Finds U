Might as well been a skeleton
Ain't have no life within me
My heart needed some medicine, couldn't find the right remedies
Sinking into the quicksand
Tryna hide the way I feel
Written over in my heart again, until I knew it was real

Then like the wind it came and bring life back, and took my heart again it gave my life no meaning
Almost like a fairytale, feels too good to be true, then it strikes as nothing you can't do

You can run but can't hide and tell you no lie when love finds you
You can try to play it off and be cool, but trust you can't lose when love finds you
Just come here and don't you fight it (when love finds you, when love finds you) finds you

Finally feel like I can breath again
Give me all the life I need, more then love you're my best friend
Glad I found someone who understands me
Before I say it you read my mind
My better half you make me feel complete
You got all the ingredients, for loves recipe

Then like the wind it came and bring life back, and took my heart again it gave my life no meaning
Almost like a fairytale, feels too good to be true, then it strikes as nothing you can't do

You can run but can't hide and tell you no lie when love finds you
You can try to play it off and be cool, but trust you can't lose when love finds you
Just come here and don't you fight it (when love finds you, when love finds you) finds you

Looking for love
I wasn't looking, I wasn't looking for love
I wasn't looking, really wasn't looking for love
I wasn't looking, really wasn't looking for love, for love, for love, ohh yea

You can run but can't hide and tell you no lie when love finds you
You can try to play it off and be cool, but trust you can't lose when love finds you
Just come here and don't you fight it (when love finds you, when love finds you) finds you
