[Verse 1]
I tried to paint you a picture
The colors were all wrong
Black and white didn’t fit you
And all along
You were shaded with patience, and strokes of everything
That I need just to make it, but I can see that

[Pre-Chorus]
Lord knows I failed you time and again
But you and me are all right

[Chorus 1]
We won’t say our goodbyes
You know it’s better that way
We won’t break, we won’t die
It's just a moment of change

[Chorus 2]
All we are, all we are
Is everything that’s right
All we need, all we need
A lover’s alibi

[Verse 2]
I walked a minute in your shoes
They never would’ve fit
I figured there’s nothing to lose
I need to get
Some perspective on these words
Before I write them down
You’re an island and my ship
Has run aground

[Pre-Chorus]
Lord knows I'll fail you time and again
But you and me are alright, yeah

[Chorus 1]
We won’t say our goodbyes
You know it’s better that way
We won’t break, we won’t die
It's just a moment of change

[Chorus 2]
All we are, all we are
Is everything that’s right
All we need, all we need
A lover’s alibi

[Bridge]
Every single day that I can breathe
You change my philosophy
I’m never gonna let you pass me by

[Chorus 1]
So don’t say your goodbyes
You know it’s better that way
We won’t break, we won’t die
It's just a moment of change, yeah
So don't say our goodbyes
You know it’s better that way
We won’t break, we won’t die
It's just a moment of change

[Chorus 2]
All we are, all we are
Is everything that’s right
All we need, all we need
A lover’s alibi, yeah

[Chorus 1]
So don’t say our goodbyes
You know it’s better
We won’t break, we won’t die
