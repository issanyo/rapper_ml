[Hook - Justin Timberlake] (Timbaland) - 2X
I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls can like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess what, what (don't really give a hootnanny)

[Verse 1 - Bubba Sparxxx]
Now I done banged a heap of +Betties+ in various modes of transport
And told them there's the exit, be sure that they close the damn door
The quiet country types is usually those I scam for
Some scared at first, but usually those demand more
Really ain't conceited, I just call myself the cutter bug
A horny little parasite that all these women love to love
Tell you what it is today, I ain't concerned with what it was
Bubba fittin to get it done, I put that on my brother Russ
Hear them in the closet, in the kitchen, just a whisperin
Bubba so psst psst, knowin that I'm listenin
I ain't got a chain, boy my pecker's all that's glistenin
What ya'll steamin on folk, ya'll in need of discipline
I ain't leavin nothin, this the house me and my people built
Huggin me and dappin me, buddy I can see your guilt
It's cold when you're wrong and you lookin like you need a quilt
Ya'll matter less everytime this margarita tip

[Verse 2 - Bubba Sparxxx]
A lot of ya'll was thinkin that Bubba would probably disappear
Get some show money from +Ugly+ and buy a keg of beer
Add another pig to give my other pigs some company
Rent a doublewide and just live it out in luxury
In due time, but there's business left to tend to
I need another farm to bequeath my next of kin to
And another track before my great aunt Missy
Yeah I've been drinkin but I ain't that pissy
Thinkin back to when my daddy told me what it's all about
He said "no matter what I do in life, some of ya'll pout"
I can deal with that long as all my folks is eatin good
Let that chowder pass over more than any Easter could
I'm on the roll again and I ain't talkin ecstacy
Tell them folks at Interscope they fittin to write some checks to me
Soon as me and Timmy finish up this latest pig schlop
Man I think you right, it ain't nothin but some hick-hop

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx]
I'm back off in the saddle with that smile and that cajolery
Momma always knew how big a stallion I would grow to be
Way beyond these suckers both lyrically and vocally
I doubted for a moment, now it's clear to me I'm supposed to be
An uncanny wit plus a time that is impeccable
Make the sharpest cat feel his mind is just a vegetable
How does Bubba do it, you won't find it in a manual
Confused them all at first, so this time is understandable
Starin at the ceiling fan, ponderin my future now
Wonderin what the hell to do with all this loot I found
Got my tractor polished up and I'm as drunk as Cooter Brown
Navigatin yet another one of Timmy's super sounds
