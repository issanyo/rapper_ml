[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down
But wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around
And say

[Chorus]
That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late

[Verse 2]
I'd take another chance
Take a fall, take a shot for you, oh, oh
I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new, yeah
I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue
And you say
Sorry, like an angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

[Chorus]
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late, oh, oh
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late, oh
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize, yeah

[Outro]
I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
