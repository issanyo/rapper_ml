[Intro]
Someone needs to rap off, in, off the top
Yeah, yeah
Y-y-y-y-y-y-y-yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You're standing at the door
I'm falling to the floor
You look even better than you did before
I'm staring at my feet
Wondering if I can do this
It's been a while, but I couldn't forget you

[Pre-Chorus]
Just a little look has got me feeling things
Just a little touch has got me seeing things
Just a little taste has got me off the chains
Doing things that I don't wanna do

[Chorus]
Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you

[Verse 2]
We're sitting real close and I can feel your breath
I wanna touch your hand, but I lay back
'Cause you know this thing could spiral in the night
I've changed my mind, I'm ready for you this time

[Pre-Chorus]
Just a little look has got me feeling things
Just a little touch has got me seeing things
Just a little taste has got me off the chains
Doing things that I don't wanna do

[Chorus]
Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you
Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you

[Bridge]
We're sitting real close, I can feel your breath
I wanna touch your hand, but I lay back
We're sitting real close, I can feel your breath
I wanna touch your hand, I cannot fight it off
(D-d-d-d-do it)

[Chorus]
Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you
Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Y-y-y-y-y-y-y-yeah
Yeah, yeah
Y-y-y-y-y-y-y-yeah
Yeah, yeah
