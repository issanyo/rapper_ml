[Verse 1]
(What?)
Is that all you got to say?
(What? What?)
You're rubbing me the wrong way
(See your lips moving)
But I don't catch a word you say
(Shut up your chatter)
I need for you to go away

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I hear is ay ya ya ya ya
You're talking way too much
I can't even hear me now
All your noise is messing with my head
You're in my head
Get outta my head

[Chorus]
Outta my, outta my head
Want you outta my head
Outta my, outta my head
Get out of my head
Outta my, outta my head
Want you outta my head
Outta my, outta my head
That's what I said

[Verse 2]
(What?)
You looking at me for, huh?
(Show me)
Respect or I will show you the door
(Get out that door)
Lately
I've got a problem with the way that you behave
(You're too much)
And all your questions don't leave me no time for me
Ha ha ha

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I hear is ay ya ya ya ya
You're talking way too much
I can't even hear me now
All your noise is messing with my head
You're in my head
Get outta my head

[Chorus]
Outta my, outta my head
Want you outta my head
Outta my, outta my head
Get out of my head
Outta my, outta my head
Want you outta my head
Outta my, outta my head

[Post-Chorus]
And all I hear is ay ya ya ya ya
You're talking way too much
I can't even hear me now
All your noise is messing with my head
You're in my head
Get outta my head

[Verse 3]
All your opinions, keep 'em to yourself
Just let me think so I can hear myself
Wouldn't it be nice if I could just go solo, take the day off?
I'd be alright if you would leave me to it, back the fuck off
Ay ya ya ya ya
You're talking way too much
You tell me one more time how I should live
I swear I'll bite your head off
I am who I am and I can't be no one else
You've got nothing nice to say
Keep your comments to yourself
Ow!

[Chorus]
Outta my, outta my head
Want you outta my head
Outta my, outta my head
Get out of my head
Outta my, outta my head
Want you outta my head
Outta my, outta my head

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I hear is ay ya ya ya ya
You're talking way too much
I can't even hear me now
All your noise is messing with my head
You're in my head
Get outta my head

[Chorus]
Outta my, outta my head
Want you outta my head
Outta my, outta my head
Get out of my head
Outta my, outta my head
Want you outta my head
Outta my, outta my head

[Outro/ Post-Chorus]
And all I hear is ay ya ya ya ya
You're talking way too much
I can't even hear me now
All your noise is messing with my head
You're in my head
Get outta my head
