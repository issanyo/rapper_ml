[Intro]
Here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind
Here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind
Here's my version of it, eternal whirlwind

[Verse 1]
What's the lesser of two evils?
If a suicide bomber made to look pregnant
Manages to kill her target or not?
What's the lesser of two evils?

[Verse 2]
What's the lesser of two evils:
If she kills them or dies in vain?
Nature has fixed no limits on our hopes
Oh, what's the lesser of two evils?

[Verse 3]
What's the lesser of two evils:
If her bump was fake or if it was real?

[Outro]
Here's my version of it
Eternal whirlwind
I have fostered since childhood

Well, I don't care
Love is all
I dare to drown
To be proven wrong
