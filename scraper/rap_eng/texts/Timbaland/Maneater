[Intro]
Uuuuuh Uuuuuh
Uuuuuh Uuuuuh

[Verse 1]
Everybody look at me, me
I walk in the door you start screaming
Come on everybody what are you here for
Move your body around like a nympho
Everybody get your necks to crack around
All you crazy people come on jump around
I want to see you all on your knees, knees
You either want to be with me, or be me

[Chorus]
Man-eater, make you work hard
Spend hard
Want all, of her love
She's a Man-eater
Make you buy cars
Cut cords
Fall real hard in love
She's a Man-eater, make you work hard
Spend hard
Want all, of her love
She's a Man-eater
Make you buy cars
Cut cords
Wish you never met her at all

Uuuuuh Uuuuuh

[Verse 2]
And when she walks she walks with passion
When she talks, she talks like she can handle it
When she asks for something boy she means it
Even if you never ever see it
Everybody get your necks to crack around
All you crazy people come on jump around
You doing anything to keep her by your side
Because, she said she love you, love you long time

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Now you wish you never met her at all
Now you wish you never met her at all
Now you wish you never met her at all
Now you wish you never met her at all
