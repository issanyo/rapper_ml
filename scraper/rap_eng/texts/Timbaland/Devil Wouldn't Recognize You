[Verse 1]
As quiet as it is tonight
You'd almost think you were safe
Your eyes are full of surprises
They cannot predict my fate
Waiting underneath the stars
There's something you should know
The angels, they surround my heart
Telling me to let you go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I barely couldn’t, I barely couldn’t recognize
But I played right into it, who am I to criticize?
Somehow I'll get through it and you won't even realize
Falling through your own disguise

[Chorus]
It's like over and over
You're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over, you can lie to me right through your smile
I've seen behind your eyes
Now I'm sober, no more intoxicating my mind
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do, I do, I do

[Verse 2]
You almost fooled yourself this time
That all of the saints be praised
You hide your sadness behind your smile
And you keep your lost heartbreaks (your lost heartbreaks)
The steps that edge along the ledge
It's much higher than it seems
But I've been on that ledge before
You can't hide yourself from me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I barely couldn’t, I barely couldn’t recognize
I still play right into it, who am I to criticize?
Somehow I'll get through it and you won't even realize
Falling through your own disguise

[Chorus]
It's like over and over
You're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over, you can lie to me right through your smile
I've seen behind your eyes
Now I'm sober, no more intoxicating my mind
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do, I do, I do

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
It's like over and over
You're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over, you can lie to me right through your smile
I've seen behind your eyes
Now I'm sober, no more intoxicating my mind
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, you, you, you

[Outro]
Devil wouldn't recognize you, you, you, you
Devil wouldn't recognize you, you, you, you
Devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
I-I, I do
You, you, you, you
Devil wouldn't recognize you, recognize you
You, you, you, you
But I do (you, you)
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you (you, you..)
I-I-I do
