[Intro: Timbaland]
Yeah, one-two, welcome to, welcome to the La La Land

[Hook: Max’C & Timbaland, ]
It’s not all about the money, not all about the fame
Not all about the money money (lalala)
It’s not all about the money, not all about the fame
Not all about the money money (Ti-ti-timati)

[Part 1: Timati]
Baby girl let me haller at you
Hop in a seat this car’s faster
But take a minute, let me explain
You need somebody who ride when time change
Could you be the one to ride it shotgun
I hope in my heart you’re the right one
See we’ve never been fake, we’ve been very thick
Don’t worry ’bout the stars with bright glare

[Part 1: Timati]
You would get it girl but you ain’t like that
I see you’re different, I like that
See, the money and the cars don’t mean a thing
It ain’t about the fame, it’s still a game
If you hold my baby, truly your man, just stick to the plan
Gonna give you my last name, gonna show you I ain’t playin’
These girls be all over me but I know they ain’t down for me
I see my future with you girl, I see you brought on the world
Could you be the one to ride it shotgun
I hope in my heart, you’re the right one
See we’ve never been fake, we’ve been very thick
Don’t worry ’bout the stars with bright glare

[Bridge Max’C & Timati]
Now she got a hold on me
I’ve got a girl and I know damn well she loves me
And she got control of me
I’ve been down and I’m never gonna leave her lonely

[Hook: Max’C]
It’s not all about the money, not all about the fame
Not all about the money money
It’s not all about the money, not all about the fame
Not all about the money money
It’s not all about the money, not all about the fame
See, I don’t really get her, she really don’t mean a thing
I just need you by my side, don’t you ever go away
I’ll do anything, I want you to stay

[Bridge:  Max’C]
Oh-oh oh-oh, just stay
Oh-oh oh-oh, just stay
Oh-oh oh-oh, oh woh

[Part 2: Grooya & Timbaland]
I know you’re used to flashy things and the high life
But I’m not that type of girl that you can buy
You gotta love me but you’re hot, hot boy
’cause I’ve been true from the start, start boy
Na-na na-na-na thanks, can’t put me in the net
If would spend the time with me (yeah)
Ye-ye ye-ye-ye I’m the girl you need to meet
I need you dedicated fully to me

[Bridge: Max’C & Grooya]
She got a hold on me
I’ve got a guy and I know damn well he loves me
And she got control of me
I’ve been down and I’m never gonna leave him lonely

[Pre-Hook: Max’C]
Money money money money
Money money money money
Money money money money
Money money money money
Money money money money
Money money money money
Money money money money

[Hook: Max’C]
It’s not all about the money, not all about the fame
Not all about the money money
It’s not all about the money, not all about the fame
Not all about the money money
It’s not all about the money, not all about the fame
See, I don’t really get her, she really don’t mean a thing
I just need you by my side, don’t you ever go away
I’ll do anything, I want you to stay

[Bridge: Max’C & Timbaland]
Oh-oh oh-oh, just stay
Welcome to La La Land
Oh-oh oh-oh, just stay
Oh-oh oh-oh, oh woh

[Outro: Max’C, Grooya & Timbaland]
Now she got a hold on me
I’ve got a guy and I know damn well he loves me
And she got control of me
I’ve been down and I’m never gonna leave him lonely
Welcome to La La Landn
