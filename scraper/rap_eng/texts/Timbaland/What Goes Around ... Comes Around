[Verse 1]
Hey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away?
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you baby
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without you
Tell me is this fair?

[Chorus]
Is this the way its really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
I shouldn't known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
Well that's okay baby 'cause in time you will find

[Hook]
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

[Verse 2]
Now girl, I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now
And maybe I should do the same
Funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you baby
And now it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without you
Tell me is this fair?

[Chorus]
Is this the way its really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
I shouldn't known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
Well that's okay baby 'cause in time you will find

[Hook]
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

[Bridge]
What goes around comes around
You should know that
What goes around comes around
You should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without you
Tell me is this fair?

[Chorus]
Is this the way its really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
I shouldn't known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
Well that's okay baby 'cause in time you will find

[Hook]
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
