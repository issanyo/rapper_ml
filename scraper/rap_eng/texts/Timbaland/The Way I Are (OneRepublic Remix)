[Intro: Timbaland]
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Remember the time baby (Yeah, Yeah)

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
I ain't got no money
I ain't got no car to take you on a date
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we can be the perfect soulmates
Talk to me girl

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
Now If we go Dutch you can still touch, my love is free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

[Hook: Keri Hilson Ryan Tedder]
Baby if you strip, you can get a tip
Cause I like you just the way you are
Just the way you move
I feel better man
I don't need the G's or the car keys
Boy I like you just the way you are
Got nothin' to lose
Girl I'm your biggest fan

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
I ain't got no Visa
I ain't got no Red American Express
We can't go nowhere exotic
It don't matter cause I'm the one that love you best
Talk to me girl

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
Now If we go Dutch you can still touch, my love is free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

[Hook: Keri Hilson Ryan Tedder]
Baby if you strip, you can get a tip
Cause I like you just the way you are
Just the way you move
I feel better man
I don't need the G's or the car keys
Boy I like you just the way you are
Got nothin' to lose
Girl I'm your biggest fan

[Verse 3: D.O.E.]
Yeah, Baby girl, I don't got a huge ol' house I rent a room in a house (Yeah, Yeah)
Listen baby girl, I ain't got a motorboat but I can float your boat (Yeah, Yeah)
So listen baby girl, once you get a dose of D.O.E. you're gonna want some more (Yeah)
So listen baby girl, when I make it I want you back, want you back, yeah

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Just the, Just the, Just the...

[Bridge/Verse 4: Ryan Tedder]
I ain't got no money, but I got some time
What's mine is yours girl and whats yours is mine
We are what we are, no need to apologize
Now tell me what you have in mind (Talk to me girl...)

[Hook: Keri Hilson Ryan Tedder]
Baby if you strip, you can get a tip
Cause I like you just the way you are
Just the way you move
I feel better man
I don't need the G's or the car keys
Boy I like you just the way you are
Got nothin' to lose
Girl I'm your biggest fan
