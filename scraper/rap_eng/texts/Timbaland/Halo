[Verse 1]
I can make love feel just like Heaven
I can be a little devil in bed and
Even clean and cook your breakfast
But I'm not perfect
I, I can take off when you need 'my time'
I can cheerlead for you from the sideline
Whisper in your ear, so divine
But I'm not perfect

[Pre-ChorusChorus]
I beg you for forgiveness for all of the mistakes I’ve made
Be patient with me, baby, I'm just tryna make my way
I'm not a super hero, sorry I couldn’t save the day
But believe me, oh, when I say...

[Chorus]
That I'm sorry I couldn’t wear your halo, halo, halo, halo
I'm sorry I couldn’t be your angel, angel, angel, angel
I'm sorry I couldn’t wear your halo, halo, halo, halo
I'm sorry I didn’t stroke your ego, ego, ego, oh, no
Yes baby, but I guess wasn’t able
Sorry I couldn’t wear your halo (Halo, halo)

[Verse 2]
I know how to put your mind at ease, yeah
I can kiss you for all four seasons
Surprise you for no reason
But I'm not perfect... no
Fall on my knees and pray for our love
Promise not to let anything come between us
How could you let us fall apart all because
I'm not perfect

[Pre-Chorus]
I beg you for forgiveness for all of the mistakes I’ve made
Be patient with me, baby, I'm just tryna make my way
I'm not a super hero, sorry I couldn’t save the day
But believe me, oh, when I say...

[Chorus]
That I'm sorry I couldn’t wear your halo, halo, halo, halo
I'm sorry I couldn’t be your angel, angel, angel, angel
I'm sorry I couldn’t wear your halo, halo, halo, halo
I'm sorry I didn’t stroke your ego, ego, ego, oh, no
Yes baby, but I guess wasn’t able
Sorry I couldn’t wear your halo (Halo, halo)

[Bridge]
Oh, it was like you never knew my heart
I swear sometimes you are so hard on me
'Cause I'm not everything that you want me to be
I'm so sorry, I didn’t want you to see me this way
I'm so sorry, I didn’t mean to fall from grace
I didn’t mean to fall from grace

[Chorus]
I'm sorry I couldn’t wear your halo, halo, halo, halo
I'm sorry I couldn’t be your angel, angel, angel, angel
I'm sorry I couldn’t wear your halo, halo, halo, halo
I'm sorry I didn’t stroke your ego, ego, ego, oh, no
Yes baby, but I guess wasn’t able
Sorry I couldn’t wear your halo (Halo, halo)
