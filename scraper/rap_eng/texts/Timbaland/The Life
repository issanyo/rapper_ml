[Intro: Tdot Illdude]
You gotta feel me though
Sing an epsiode
Backseat of my Jeep, I swing an episode
You never know
Damn, you never know

[Bridge: Tdot Illdude]
You gotta feel me though, you gotta feel me though
Backseat of my Jeep, let's swing an episode
Backseat of my Jeep, let's swing an episode
You never know, you never know
Gotta feel me though, gotta feel me though
Backseat of my Jeep, let's swing an episode
Backseat of my Jeep, let's swing an episode
You never know, you never know

[Chorus: Candice & Tdot Illdude]
Don't put up a fight, you know what I like
Too boujie for beer, don't want no wine, champagne on ice, I, I
Louis luggage on flights (Louis luggage on flights)
Took a shot at good nights (took a shot at good nights)
Took a shot on the dice, I, I (took a shot on the dice)

[Verse 1: Tdot Illdude]
Took a shot on the dice, this the life that I want
When I look in the mirror I know what I want
I got you now they won't take you from me, woo
Ain't no second guessing girl you gon' see, oh
I been diggin' you, I been plotting for a while
All my niggas with it, we been mobbing for a while
Getting high on you, I ain't never going down
Going all the way up, I ain't never going down
Real niggas wear crowns, bad bitches wear crowns
Getting high off you, I ain't never coming down
Heard them niggas talk down, they don't never be around

[Chorus: Candice & Tdot Illdude]
Don't put up a fight, you know what I like
Too boujie for beer, don't want no wine, champagne on ice, I, I
Louis luggage on flights (Louis luggage on flights)
Took a shot at good nights (nights)
Took a shot on the dice, I, I (dice)

[Verse 2: Tdot Illdude]
I took a shot on the dice and I'm not crappin' out
I got heat in the streets, I got soaked in the drought, I got folks coming out
They say we sold out
But my show is sold out
'Cause my talent no doubt so we ball on the couch
Spillin' liquor up out
We in the house
So my bitches is 'bout it
We in the house
So my niggas is 'bout it
We in the house
So my bitches is 'bout it
We in the house
So my niggas is 'bout it

[Chorus: Candice]
Don't put up a fight, you know what I like
Too boujie for beer, don't want no wine, champagne on ice, I, I
Louis luggage on flights
Took a shot at good nights
Took a shot on the dice, I, I
