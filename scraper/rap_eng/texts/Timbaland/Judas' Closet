[Intro: Nipsey Hussle]
Ay
They say be careful what you wish for
You might fuck around and get that shit

[Hook: Game & Nipsey Hussle]
Feel like I sold my fucking soul to the devil for these palm trees and these 64's
Feel like I sold my fucking soul to the devil for these palm trees and these 64's
Cedar, six O, wife beater, wrist froze
Platinum Jesus piece, nigga mind all gold
Feel like I sold my fucking soul to the devil for these palm trees and these 64's

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
When you come from depression, tend to lust for possessions
Gotta make an impression, but you can't wait for your blessing
Model bitches strip naked, while I sip on this Texas
I'm pushing this German, Jesus piece on my necklace
These niggas gon' test you, and these bitches is reckless
And that money go fast, I hope you paying your taxes
All the questions they asking, all the cameras thats flashing
All the stress that come with it, it's like you hustling backwards
If you ain't breaking the bank, so we go hard everyday
In the sacrificial lamb, it's just the part that you play
And you the first one in your fam' to have the heart to get paid
Had the smarts to switch lanes, had the guts to be brave
Now, and now you a star on the stage
But once they cut on them lights, no turning them off, that's part of the game
Wow, people caught up in your fame
And never will it be the same, this shit is expensive
The price that we pay, that's why I

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Game]
Clip tosses, since niggas is brick flossing
Now the bloods with Slauson, so niggas go get coffins
Compton like the NFL, niggas get hit often
Hairy bud I green, make niggas forget Boston
Red bone bitch, she high on blue dolphins
Head game sick, she bi and switch often
It's kush bitch, quit coughing
My six, got streets talking
Timbo' this shit scorching, got bloods and crips walking
It's Nip', so get up off him
We like Biggie and Jigga mane'
The Nickerson's is Marcy, Bed-Stuy and Slauson
My flow something like Nasir, I should put a pause here
Run and tell niggas the gods here
This Califonia kush got me in God's ear
We got them ace of spades, but ain't no cards here
Just a crip, a blood, a couple exotic cars here
And these extra long Clips, like Lamar's here

[Hook]
