[Intro]
Bounce, bounce, bounce

[Verse 1]
I ain't got no feeling, I'mma let these niggas know
I've been killin 'em with these beats
Now I'm spittin' them killer flow
What you know about me, dog? Not a damn thing
Got a problem, nigga? Shoot me in the streets, dog
I'm a one-man game
Don't take this lightly, if I want you dead, you gone
I can make that happen because, nigga, my bread is long
I done been on both sides of the track
You can say I changed the game
A lot of niggas try to get in my lane
Everybody askin' me the same whole thing, what he say?

[Hook]
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to?

[Verse 2]
I ain't goin' nowhere, dog, I'mma be right here in your face
Can't do it like me, dog, your kick drum ain't got enough bass
Don't ever talk bad about me, you just might make me mad
And I just might see you somewhere and break your ass in half
This not a Timbaland that you used to
Now I'm in a whole 'nother zone
You could let me do me, you could do you
Or get popped in your dome
Hit love for the birds to the block, so recognize the game
Timbaland ain't gotta run nowhere, baby
Timbaland got private planes

[Hook]
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)

[Bridge]
I've been around, some time long ago
I've seen the light, don't act like you ain't seen it before

[Verse 3]
I'm listenin' dog, you ain't sayin' shit
You can keep on wishin', you never make a hit
Yeah, I got money, take it all from me, I'm gon' be the same
You can get a few whips, you can get a few chips
You still gon' be a lame
We ain't the same, my nigga, I'm on some other shit
I'mma say this plain and simple, nigga, take this punishment
I'mma take ya'll on a trip, I'mma take ya'll on a ride
And one day I'm gon' dip, but I won't be hard to find

[Hook]
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he gon' run to?
