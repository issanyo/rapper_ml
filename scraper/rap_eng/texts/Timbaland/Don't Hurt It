[Chorus 1: Dev]
You like the way I work it, work it
Push up on it, but don't hurt it, hurt it
You like the way I work it, work it
Push up on it, but don't hurt it, hurt it
You like the way I work it, work it
Push up on it, but don't hurt it, hurt it
You like the way I work it, work it
Push up on it, but don't hurt it, hurt it

[Verse 1: Dev & Timbaland]
Un, Deux, Tre, Quat, in the club off candy bars
You a fan of me?, I'm a fan of you
Celebrate, bitch, whoopty doo
I'm on a ocean, feeling potent
Got a pocket full of golden tokens
Quit wishin' and hopin'
Grab that ship by the wheel, goin' in!
Timbo in your backyard
Got the girls for you, got the alcohol
And I, and I party, party real hard
Love when they start to give me shit, oh
And you say you don't do shit
And you love when the bass hit
And you love when the bass hit
Boom boom boom, chicky chicky, check it

[Chorus 2: Dev]
You like the way I work it, work it
Push up on it, but don't hurt it, hurt it
You like the way I work it, work it
Push up on it, but don't hurt it, hurt it
Be cool, be easy, baby, just don't tease me
Be cool, be easy, just please me
Be cool, be easy, baby, just don't tease me
Be cool, be easy, just please me

[Verse 2: Dev & Timbaland]
Sippin' on, sippin' on, sippin' on vino
Erybody get more tranquilo
What they call that? A C note
Lets spend that on the d-low
Hit the mall, nah
Let's find a cliff we can jump off
You afraid of heights? Let me know, we can take that flight
Yeah, baby like a kitty cat, all brown, [?]
Where you buy your hips at?
I know you can didn't come built like that
This the underground world
Dev on my right, I'm right here
They love it when we drop that boom boom boom
Give it to 'em now

[Chorus 2: Dev]
You like the way I work it, work it
Push up on it, but don't hurt it, hurt it
You like the way I work it, work it
Push up on it, but don't hurt it, hurt it
Be cool, be easy, baby, just don't tease me
Be cool, be easy, just please me
Be cool, be easy, baby, just don't tease me
Be cool, be easy, just please me

[Bridge: Dev]
Don't don't hurt it, don't, don't, don't hurt it
If you want to serve it, you've got to work it, baby
Don't don't hurt it, don't don't don't hurt it
Don't don't hurt it, don't, don't, don't hurt it
If you want to serve it, you've got to work it, baby
Be cool, be easy, baby, just don't tease me
Be cool, be easy, just please me
Be cool, be easy, baby, just don't tease me
Be cool, be easy, just please me
You like the way I
You like the way I
It's The Cataracs
You like the way I work it, work it
Push up on it, but don't hurt it, hurt it

[Chorus 1: Dev]
You like the way I work it, work it
Push up on it, but don't hurt it, hurt it
You like the way I work it, work it
Push up on it, but don't hurt it, hurt it
You like the way I work it, work it
Push up on it, but don't hurt it, hurt it
You like the way I work it, work it
Push up on it, but don't hurt it, hurt it
