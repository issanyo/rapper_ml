[Verse 1]
I know that when I step up in the room, all eyes is on me
They hate me, at the same time they be wishing they can know me
I got that heat, that fire, got you sweating like a sauna
Yeah, I run things, my name should be Obama

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Round of applause, with a standing ovation
Standing ovations, we be selling out the stadium
Radio's on, now I'm heard on every station
What you waiting for? Now, watch me take the nation
I, I see the way you're looking at me
You're wishing you could be on my team
We be up on that, making everybody mad
[?] you like that, like that

[Chorus]
We be riding around in that new new
Shoes and bags of that new new
Watch me get me that new new
That new new
We hit the club with that new new
Walk around with that new new
Now watch me get me that new new
That new new, that new new

[Verse 2]
I'm what the people asking for, exactly what they wanted
I look and feel and smell just like a brand new bag of money
Yeah, I'm a Queen, I got the boys all buzzing for my honey
To think we going down on me is funny

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Round of applause, with a standing ovation
Standing ovations, we be selling out the stadium
Radio's on, now I'm heard on every station
What you waiting for? Now, watch me take the nation
I, I see the way you're looking at me
You're wishing you could be on my team
We be up on that, making everybody mad
Cause they ain't do it like that

[Chorus]
We be riding around in that new new
Shoes and bags of that new new
Watch me get me that new new
That new new
We hit the club with that new new
Walk around with that new new
Now watch me get me that new new
That new new, that new new

[Bridge]
We ride around in that new new

Yeah, everything we own is that new new
Yeah, all we know is that new new

We be riding around in that new new
Shoes and bags of that new new
Watch me get me that new new

We hit the club with that new new
Walk around with that new new

That new new, that new new
We be riding around in that new new
Shoes and bags of that new new
Watch me get me that new new

We hit the club with that new new
Walk around with that new new
Now watch me get me that new new
