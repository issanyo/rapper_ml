[Intro: Chester Bennington]
"I ordered a Frappuccino, where's my fucking Frappuccino?"
"Alright, let's do this."

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend, I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can, but
I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay, I'm just
Trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be so I'm
Lying my way from

[Chorus: Jay Z]
If you feelin' like a pimp, nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me
From the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of bottom, to the Top of the Pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, â€˜cause I'm straight with the Roc, c'mon

[Chorus (extended): Jay Z]
If you feelin' like a pimp, nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But, like, 52 cards went out, I'm through dealin'
Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceilin'
In case 52 broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real, chill

[Verse 4: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Yeah, I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listenin' to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in
And now you think this person really is me and I'm
Trying to bend the truth
But the more I push, the more I'm pulling away 'cause I'm
Lying my way from

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & (Mike Shinoda)]
You (nah, no turning back now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(Nah, no turning back now)
Let me take me back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(Nah, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you, the very worst part of you
Is me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this, this isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me Like this, this isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this, this isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this

[Chorus: Chester Bennington (Jay-Z & Mike Shinoda)]
You (no turning back now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(Nah, no turning back now)
Let me take me back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(Nah, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you, the very worst part of you
Is me

[Outro: Jay-Z]
Biatch!
