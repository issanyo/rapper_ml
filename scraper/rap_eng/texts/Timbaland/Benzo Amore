[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
Selfish, selfish
She just call me selfish, selfish
I want her to myself I'm selfish, selfish
Don't wanna see her with nobody else just
Me cos I'm selfish, selfish
I want her to myself selfish, selfish
With nobody chill selfish, selfish
Don't wanna see her with nobody else just
Me cos I'm selfish

[Verse: Dean Blunt]
Girl says I'm selfish, not a lie
But she can't get this shit from any other guy
Every time she comes around I make her cry
Bryson Tiller, got me working overtime
Bring it back 'cos a nigga feel it (overtime)
And a girl gonna know by the time I'm finish
Wanna dead the rumours and the lies
Just wanna be alive
Next time I see her

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
Selfish, selfish
She just call me selfish, selfish
I want her to myself I'm selfish, selfish
Don't wanna see her with nobody else just
Me cos I'm selfish, selfish
I want her to myself selfish, selfish
With nobody chill selfish, selfish
Don't wanna see her with nobody else just
Me cos I'm selfish
