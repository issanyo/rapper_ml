[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Do you remember
The 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

[Verse 1: Anna Kendrick]
Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away

[Chorus: Earth, Wind & Fire]
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

[Post-Chorus: Earth, Wind & Fire]
Ba duda, ba duda, ba duda, badu
Ba duda, badu, ba duda, badu
Ba duda, badu, ba duda

[Verse 2: Anna Kendrick]
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now December found the love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember, the true love we share today

[Chorus: Earth, Wind & Fire]
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

And we say
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake]
The bell was ringing, aha
Our souls were singing
Do you remember
Never was a cloudy day

[Chorus: Earth, Wind & Fire]
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
Break it down for me (Say do you remember)
Dancing in september

[Chorus: Earth, Wind & Fire & Justin Timberlake]
Ba de ya
Say do you remember
Do you remember?
Ba de ya - dancing in September (Dancing in september)
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

[Outro: Earth, Wind & Fire & Justin Timberlake]
Uh huh! (Bring it back now)
Dancing in september
Uh huh!
All the way down to the summer
