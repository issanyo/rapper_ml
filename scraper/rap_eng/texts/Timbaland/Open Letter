[Intro: F. Mills]
Trek. Hustle. Fuck these niggas

[Intro: Swizz Beats]
Ladies and gentlemen
Goddammit

[Verse 1: F. Mills]
Why you niggas playing for
What I stand for
Loyalty I afford to be on this playing floor
So focused they don't worry me let me fast forward
Yeah PD was working me shit was getting boring
Now these niggas mad cuz I just keep scoring
Haters only watch me cuz I just keep going
Foreign, got the gang out on the beach
My mama said to sing
Told me look how far I can reach
I told her I was nervous
She told me that was defeat
Just fuck the naysayers
It's all about inner peace
Peace, kissed his head and told him to sleep
I said I got it from here let the family weep
Preach, if I fall I'll land on my feet
The last time we spoke I was working new years eve
Her friends so full of shit
Guess they told her things she believed
Well, that's fine I'll keep doing me
My next chapter, moving on I can fucking breathe
They ain't got the time when you on the grind
Get some dollars and
Now I'm all on these bitches mind, shine
I've been running, I'm feeling fine
I'm In my prime
Hustle backwards ain't got the time
Haters yapping like they a mime
They ain't saying shit
So how they affecting I?
These disrespectful niggas like really like who am I?
I'm the same mu'fucka that fought for you are you blind?
I stayed with them codes like fuck it eye for an eye
Shit, I'm appalled that you all in mine
I been qualified

[Outro: F. Mills]
Oh I been qualified (2xs)
To live my life like this
It's nights like this
Oh I been qualified
To live my life like this
It's nights like this
