[Chorus]
I don't see no one but us, no one
I don't see no one but us, no one
I don't see no one but us, no one
No one (For real)

[Verse 1]
I keep my head to the sky (No one)
I keep my eye on what's mine (No one)
I earned my spot from my grind (No one, for real, no one, for real)
Please do not fuck up my vibe (No one)
Don't keep no fake shit alive (No one)
That's just a waste of my time (No one, hah, no one, for real)
Yeah, got a few bottles on ice (No one)
We gon sip good and get nice (No one)
We gon eat good then eat twice (No one, for real, no one)

[Chorus]
I don't see no one but us, no one
I don't see no one but us, no one
I don't see no one but us, no one
No one (For real)

[Verse 2]
I don't see no one but me and my niggas
I don't see you less you down since beginning
These niggas be wishing these bitches be tripping (No one)
Fuck what you talking just miss me with whispers
Got my own vision I'm seeing it different (No one)
Shoot for the stars I put my clip in
Now we in position fully in position (No one)
Niggas be switching I'm keeping my distance (No one)
No expectations for any of these niggas
You not my friend you my enemy nigga
Be on some shit you could never be nigga (No one)
And I'm so far out you could never see nigga
Backwood inhaling see hangover remedy (No one)
No matter how faded these bitches get they gonna remember me
(No one, no one)

[Chorus]
I don't see no one but us, no one
I don't see no one but us, no one
I don't see no one but us, no one
No one (For real)

[Break]
I don't see no one but us, no one
I don't see no one but us, no one
I don't see no one but us, no one
No one (For real)

[Verse 3]
They said Dot don't rap no more he all melodies
Mad cause I made it out the trap with no felonies
You was never helping me so how is you telling me
What I should be doing now that the world feeling me
Niggas got input
Then it be the gossip like you don't know the work me and my men put
Early morning late nights no sleep just rest up
Hustle on some militant shit my nigga ten-hut
We was at the table breaking the shit down
Scraping up our last you wouldn't even put in 10 bucks
Now they want a meeting and they get mad
When a nigga busy like a nigga not working
Trying write me that next one
Shine like VS1
They saying I'm next up but I feel like I been on
Hitting bitches that been on
Eating at fancy restaurants
Staying up at the Waldorf
Champagne get ordered
Exotic women imported
I don't sniff it or snort it
I keep it simple and boring all I need is weed and water
Mind, body, and soul I'm just tryna keep the order
Young nigga old soul I remind you of your pops
Blowing out smoke while I'm calling all the shots
All I see is us when I look up at the top
Where a nigga spill man you better get a mop
Flow like grape juice it stain when it touch
Coming where I'm from change is a must
At least it was for me I couldn't sell shit forever
2 for 5 sales pitch forever
I need more than a trip to the Bogata
Free room at the Harrah's tryna win a couple dollars
I need to take a boat to my island
I ain't even high and I'm smiling
All I see is visions of better living and vibing (For real)

[Outro: Girl]
Like you come across, like, you know, this is my passion and this is what's real to me, and I think that because it's not -- it's not an ego thing with you, like, you can tell you really love this shit. So, when you really love something and you speakin' about it, it comes out completely different, you know what I mean? And it's like, and it's because you know in your heart, the reason you ain't working a 9 to 5 is because you know in your heart what you was here to do, you what I'm sayin'? And that --- and God put that there, so if you know that and you ridin' with that, everybody gonna bow down even if you think you sound arrogant, you probably don't, because you had humility -- behind it. And humility is something that's quiet, if you humble you don't do that, you don't even worried about that shit, if you humble, you just livin', you excited to be in every moment you in, you like "Wow, this is interesting, this is cool, look at all this little cool shit that I get to enjoy, cause I'm in touch," you know? I be trying to find like the smallest shit and be like, "Yo, like this, is super cool that I get to experience this right now...
