[Intro: Voicemail & Rob]
Please leave your message for "me." Record your message after the tone
Yo, what's up K? umm, it's your boy Rob. You know I ain't heard from you in a minute. I'm trying to see whats good with you. Hit me back

[Verse 1]
I follow my heart
But every time I do, it gets me lost and left in the dark
But I think it's clear this time, I guess we're just not compatible
You pick me up, you let me down, you give me nothing to fall on Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Hook]
Damn, I wish that cupid's arrow never hit
Never went through me, through me
I wish we never crossed the line
I wish I never gave you this booty, ooh wee
It ain't 'bout no other, better friends than lovers
Let's just call this what it is babe, what it is babe

[Hook]
Bet you never thought that I would say
We were a beautiful mistake
And it is what it is
Can't say it no other way
We were a beautiful mistake
And it is what it is
Damn, I wish I could stay
But we were a beautiful mistake
Boy, you know I'm gonna miss you by my side
But it is what it is
Aw, baby
That's what it is what it is
Aw, baby

[Verse 2]
You followed your heart (your heart)
It lead you to me, but in reality I don't fit the part
We gave it a roll, but it flew outta control
Now don't get me wrong
What we had was good, I really thought we stood a chance
But that love quickly passed

[Pre-Hook]
Damn I wish that cupid's arrow never hit
Never went through me, through me
I wish we never crossed the line
I wish I never gave you this booty, ooh wee
It ain't bout no other, better friends than lovers
Let's just call this what it is babe, what it is babe

[Hook]
Bet you never thought that I would say
We were a beautiful mistake
And it is what it is
Can't say it no other way
We were a beautiful mistake
And it is what it is
Damn, I wish I could stay
But we were a beautiful mistake
Boy, you know I'm gonna miss you by my side
But it is what it is

[Post-Hook]
Time to hang it, If you breaking up, keep your head up
That's what it is what it is
Time to hang it, If you breaking up, keep your head up

[Bridge]
Ain't no use to fight it, cause it's understood
We both know we tried it, but it didn't turn out good
Ain't no use to fight it, while it's understood
We both know we tried it, but it didn't turn out good

[Outro]
Don't you see that we're just a beautiful mistake
That's what we are
Don't you see that we're just a beautiful mistake
That's what we are
Don't you see that we're just a beautiful mistake
That's what we are
Don't you see that we're just a beautiful mistake
That's what we are
Don't you see that we're just a beautiful mistake
That's what we are
Don't you see that we're just a beautiful mistake
That's what we are
Don't you see that we're just a beautiful mistake
