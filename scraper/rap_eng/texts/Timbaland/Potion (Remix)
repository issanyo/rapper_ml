[Intro: Futuristic]
What's up?
What's up?

[Verse 1: Futuristic]
Yo, I'm on the potion like a kid that's takin' chemistry
Anytime I touch the beat, I swear, I'm makin' history
Feel like Drake up in my state, I got a lotta enemies
Know I'm Doctor Evil cause I got a lotta Mini-Me's
That's groovy, I might just go grab the Uzi
Spray you and then take your girl to the movies and grip her booty
Hotter than a Jacuzzi, I'm ballin' like Bob Cousy
These niggas fruity like smoothies and all my tunes is so loony
It go, who he? That's me, you should know by now
My name is Futuristic, everybody 'bout to find out
Travelin' the world, lookin' at crowds and then I dive out
You at home starin' at the walls like you in time-out
This beat is ludicrous, watch what I come and do to this
So hooligan, who could spit like a lunatic, it's humorous
Numerous improvements, I proved that I'm very luminous
I'm hungry, I should cop a crib in Budapest, who is this?
I take a old beat then make it feel new, I could
Take a new whip then make it look used, I could
Take a wack song and make it feel cool, I could
Never spit lies, I only speak truth, so
Go get the album, turn up the volume, we flowin' like a fountain
First week I'm tryin' to do a hundred thousand
Every show gon' be crowded, I'm coppin' a couple houses
And if anybody doubted then they gettin' Ronda Rousey'd
I'm gone

[Verse 2: Devvon Terrell]
You can get yourself Ronda Rousey'd, hittin' your head and body
These niggas is like [?] cause they so good for nothin'
What if I take both of your feet from under you, hit the bottom
Even though you hated on me, I get my hand, got him
You a actor, I coulda sworn I've seen you on Broadway
You see me and you know that I keep it real, all day
You runnin', I'm askin' him, "Where you at, man?"
Scared cause I'm eatin' every beat I'm on like I'm Pac-Man
Nom, nom, nom, [?] go dumb, check out the scale now
Your girl said he sound like a pussy while eatin' me out
Whoa, I would hate to be ya
I say shorty what she really mean like I'm Beiber
Say that you remind her of a virgin
Say that you a [?] and all you doin' is learnin', worthless
Shorty [?] knees, oh, you should curve 'em
Show you how I live, you know I be at your crib like pop quiz
