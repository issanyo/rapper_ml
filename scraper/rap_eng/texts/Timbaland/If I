JT (Justin Timberlake) : Cause those are the type of girls that I like
T.I. : Uhm

[Intro : JT and T.I.]
Weeell... This is for the girls who get tipsy
But never get too drunk
This is for the girls who dance sexy
But never show too much

This is for the girls who get tipsy
But never get too drunk
This is for the girls who dance sexy
But never show too ...Stop

[Hook : JT]
Say that if I'm talking shit to you (Uh)
Would you talk it back to me too, baby ?
And if I want to dance with you
Would you want to groove with me too, baby ?

Cause we can get it on all night long girl (Yeah)
And it ain't nothing that caught you baby (Yeah)
We could get it up all night long girl (Uh)
And it ain't nothing that caught you baby (Shh)
Hoooo, hoooo, yeah...

[Verse 1 : T.I.]
Arrive on set
I'm so fresh
Immediately get the other guys upset
So fly that I ain't gotta buy no jet
That's how I get their minds on sex
Make chicks wet, literally yeah
They self so hot, and their thighs so wet
And I don't taste, no, I don't stress
Any girl I want, know that I'm gun' get
I can catch Juliet, don't need no net
Plenty fish in the sea, baby please know that
And the dude that you with
Baby he's no threat
His stacks on D, my g's on deck
What you want you receive
What you need you get
Just give me one shot like russian roulette
Bang I must confess, i'm obsessed
Just gotta get up under her dress. (Pow !)

[Hook : JT]

[Verse 2 : T.I.]
Hey miss lady
Let's say maybe we leave this place and go crazy
Get shit-faced and get x-rated
Take turns getting our faces decorated
Cum 'til your body get numb
Have you hyper ventilatin'
Make you cum until you say you can't take it (Ah), really
I just wanna give you that feelin'
Lookin' at you make me wanna spread a few shillin' (Pff)
Have a few children
Imagine me behind you drillin'
'Til you pass out through dillin'
Girl god willin' I'ma make you click on all cylinders
Scream like I'm killin' her
Bust off once i'm still in her
Go soft, oh no i didn't sir
Come with me and your gettin' served
All night 'til your muscles tight and your vision, blurred

[Hook : JT]

[Verse 3 : T.I.]
Tick tock tum
I got somethin' for you
I hope you ready
Cause you goin' get it (Boy talk to me)
And once i get them jeans off you
And get you naked
I hope you can take it (Boy talk to me)
From the front from the back
Give it to me, throw it back
Don't run from it, ain't this what you wanted? (Boy talk to me)
On the bottom, on the top
I won't stop until you pop
Girl work it, don't you like it dirty? (Now bring the hook back)
