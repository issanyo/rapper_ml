[Verse 1]
He never call me no bitch
Helped me through all of this shit
He never play with my heart like you
He don't be out with no hoes
Cheatin' and sayin' it's my fault
He never left me alone like you

[Hook]
Dinero, dinero, dinero
Where have you been all my life?
Dinero, dinero, dinero
You make me stay on my grind
Money talks, money talks, never got tired of being faithful
And wishing falls, wishing falls, ain't go time for no labels
He was always around
When you was actin' up, he still held me down
Money talks, money talks, never got tired of being faithful
And my heart is with dinero, dinero, dinero
Dinero, dinero, dinero

[Verse 2]
He always keeps me goin',  it's good to know he got it
He always feelin' on me, he be deep up in my pockets
And anytime I want it, he say baby go and cop it
And I ain't never worry cause I know just what I got with
That money so loyal  it wait on me til I get home
I want it so bad sometimes I just can't let it go
Benjamin, Benjamin, Benjamin, Benjamin
Ain't nobody else make me feel like this

[Hook]
Dinero, dinero, dinero
Where have you been all my life?
Dinero, dinero, dinero
You make me stay on my grind
Money talks, money talks, never got tired of being faithful
And wishing falls, wishing falls, ain't go time for no labels
He was always around
When you was actin' up, he still held me down
Money talks, money talks, never got tired of being faithful
And my heart is with dinero, dinero, dinero
Dinero, dinero, dinero

[Bridge]
I'm all about a dollar, dollar tonight
If you ain't bout a dollar, don't even waste your time
So can you make it rain on me tonight?
Cause I'm all about a dollar, dollar tonight

[Outro]
Dinero, dinero, dinero
Dinero, dinero
Dinero, dinero
