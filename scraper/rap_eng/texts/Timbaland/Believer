[Intro: Timbaland]
Put your hands up
Everybody put your hands up
Put your hands up

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
The world's so cold and my own damn heart is making fun of me
Don't need a miracle to see tomorrow's right in front of me
I'm on my own, and Nobody knows who we can come to be
So come along, you never know who we can set free...

[Chorus: Brandy & Timbaland]
When I close my eyes
And I run to you, aah
Can't close my heart
'Cos I know the truth, aah
'Cos I'm a believer
We need a believer
Do we got a believer, aah
Any believer aah
'Cos I'm a believer
I'm a believer
I'm a believer
We need a believer
We need a believer

[Verse 2: Brandy]
Is there one so bold
That would raise their hand to join a good fight?
There's a legend told
Someone's gonna show us what it looks like
Is it you out there
You never know who it could be
You can come on home and lead us to love
'Cos we believe

[Chorus: Brandy & Timbaland]
Then I close my eyes and I run to you
Can't close my heart cos I know the truth
'Cos I'm a believer
We need a believer
Do we got a believer, aah
Any believer, aah
'Cos I'm a believer
I'm a believer
I'm a believer
We need a believer
We need a believer

[Bridge: Brandy & (Timbaland)]
Yeah, everybody do it, everybody (put your hands up)
Can I be your influence? (Everybody put your hands up)
Everybody do it, everybody (put your hands up)
Yeah, can I be your influence?

[Chorus]
Cos I'm a believer
We need a believer
Can we get a believer, aah
Any believer, aah
'Cos I'm a believer
I'm a believer
I'm a believer
We need a believer
We need a believer
