[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
I be on my suit and tie shit, tie shit, tie
I be on my suit and tie shit, tie shit
Can I show you a few things?
A few things, a few things, little baby cause
I be on my suit and tie shit, tie shit
I be on my suit and tie shit, tie shit
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things

[Verse 1]
LES
Welcome back JT
Heard you got a record with the homie Jay-Z
So for me to jump on it - I must be crazy
But girl, they're both married baby, you can date me!
Yeah put your best dress on
Teach 'em how to stunt we'll give them a lesson
Bulletproof girl, she harder than teflon
Take her ten rounds - I call it decathlon (like a boxer baby)
Like a boxer baby
Be my Demi Moore I can be your prince
Harry Morton, take a break from recordin'
No serious dates we just courtin'
Yeah
And my ex is like a cigarette
I'm tryna quit girl you could be my Nicorette
Let's take it back to the Sheraton [Sheridan] Nicolette
Feel good
You'll never see my ass caught in an ascot
Gettin' green man, money is the mascot
I made to a "have" from a "have not"
Started rappin' now these n****s gettin' mad hot
And we off them wedge sneakers
Now my baby in Chanel gold creepers
Talkin' top of the world - Burj Khalifa
Get wit me
LES

[Timbaland] Wait a minute. You ready, JT?

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
I can't wait til I get you on the floor, good-looking
Going out so hot, just like an oven
And I'll burn myself, but just had to touch it
It's so fly and it's all mine
Hey baby, we don't mind all the watching
Cause if they study close, real close
They might learn something
She ain't nothing but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fly tonight

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'mma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
While weâ€™re in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Hey

[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake]
Stop, let me get a good look at it
So thick, now I know why they call it a fatty
Shit so sick got a hit and picked up a habit
That's alright, cause you're all mine
Go on and show 'em who you call daddy
I guess they're just mad cause girl, they wish they had it
My killer, my filler, yeah you're a classic
And you're all mine tonight

[Hook]

[Justin Timberlake] Hey, get out ya seat, Hov

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
All black at the white shows
White shoes at the black shows
Green card for the Cuban linx
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show
Nothing exceeds like the sex
Style got gout from having the best of the best
Is this what it's all about?
I'm at the restaurant with my rent
Disturbing the guests
Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex
This is trouble season
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason
All saints for my angel
Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight Denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young!
No papers, catch favors
Get high, out Vegas
? ain't looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a nigga tryna cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I show you how to do this, hun!

[Hook]
