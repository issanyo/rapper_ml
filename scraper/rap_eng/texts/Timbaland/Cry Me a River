You were my sun
And you were my earth
But you didn't know
All the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
Made other plans
But you didn't think
That they would come crashing down, no

You don't have to say (don't have to say) what you did (what you did)
I already know (already know), I found out from him
Now there's just no chance (no chance)
With you and me (you and me)
There'll never be (never be)
And don't it make you sad about it?

You told me you love me
Why'd you leave me all alone? (all alone)
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone (on the phone)
I refuse
You must have me confused
To some other guy (I'm not like that, baby)
The bridges were burned
And now it's your turn, your turn to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Yeah, yeah

And I know that they say
Some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you had only talked to them
And you know it
(Don't act like you don't know it)
All of these things people told me
Keep messing with my head (messing with my head)
You should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it

You don't have to say (don't have to say) what you did (what you did)
I already know (already know), I found out from him
Now there's just no chance (no chance)
With you and me (you and me)
There'll never be (never be)
And don't it make you sad about it?

You told me you love me
Why'd you leave me all alone? (all alone)
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone (on the phone)

To some other guy (I'm not like that, baby)
The bridges were burned
And now it's your turn, your turn to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Yeah, yeah

The damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving, oh, oh, oh
The damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving, oh, oh, oh
The damage is done
The damage is done
The damage is done, oh, oh, oh
The damage is done
The damage is done
The damage is done, oh, oh, oh

You don't have to say (don't have to say) what you did (what you did)

Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river

Cry me, cry me
Cry me a river
Cry me, cry me
Cry me a river
Cry me, cry me
Cry me a river
Cry me, cry me
