[Verse 1]
I'm standing on the edge of the industry
Wondering if it's all that important to me
To get my records back out there on the streets
It ain't like I'm hurting or anything
I'm to the point right now where money ain't an issue
I can roll where I want to, do what I wanna do
Tempted to leave it in my rear view
Because this game ain't what I'm used to

[Chorus]
Should I go? Should I stay?
I'm in control either way
Should I go? Should I stay?
I'm in control either way
Should I go? Should I stay?
I'm in control either way
Should I go? Should I stay?
I'm in control either way

[Verse 2]
It used to be a few artists at a time
Now, even the veterans waiting in line
Premature release of these albums online
Makin' it hard for real entertainers to shine
If you manage to defeat these odds against you
Keep doin' your thing cause I'm not mad at you
Just tryin' to figure out where I fit into
All of this now, or if I do

[Chorus]
Should I go? Should I stay?
I'm in control either way
Should I go? Should I stay?
I'm in control either way
Should I go? Should I stay?
I'm in control either way
Should I go? Should I stay?
I'm in control either way

[Verse 3]
This industry was more like a different world
When it was just me, Monica, and baby girl (Aaliyah)
I never got to tell you how much you meant
I wish you and me both was sittin' here workin' with Tim
Just to be in the presence of people that you affected
On a personal level Just makes me stop for a second
You were such a blessing
You only answered one of my questions

[Chorus]
Should I go? Should I stay?
I'm in control either way
Should I go? Should I stay?
I'm in control either way
Should I go? Should I stay?
I'm in control either way
Should I go? Should I stay?
I'm in control either way

[Bridge]
Well, I gave it some time
And I made up my mind
Move over, this is my time
B-Rocka's back on the grind

[Chorus]
Should I go? Should I stay?
I'm in control either way
Should I go? Should I stay?
I'm in control either way
Should I go? Should I stay?
I'm in control either way
Should I go? Should I stay?
I'm in control either way
