You used to love them, leave them, kiss them
Break their hearts, but now I got you in my arms
You used to get them, trick them, diss them
Do them wrong, but now your playa days are gone

Everybody knew about you baby and the games you played
Couldn't count the names, faces and numbers
Nor the times you laid down
But somebody knew about you baby and that you√Ç'd change
It was me cause I could see my love would turn you around

You used to love them, leave them, kiss them
Break their hearts, but now I got you in my arms
You used to get them, trick them, diss them
Do them wrong, but now your playa days are gone

I always say never say never boy, but you did
That's when I took your mind and I flipped the script
Your boys talkin' 'bout you're falling off
And that you're whipped
But who are they to say when it's all my love I give to you

You used to love them, leave them, kiss them
Break their hearts, but now I got you in my arms
You used to get them, trick them, diss them
Do them wrong, but now your playa days are gone

[Rap: Rashad]
I was a playa building on dreams doing my thing
When I saw her hunting like wolverine she up in my claws
It was puppy love now what's the timing dawg?
Vicious on the draws like jaws, dun nun, dun nun, dun nun
No girls in the water 'cause of the slaughter
Now you know I 'oughta know better like Schwarzenegger
You my eraser to the life of a hopeless playa
Big willy terminator, not greater or less
Cause you the best of the best and you know what
You put this playa to rest and caused my death, yes

Hey, hey, yeah
(You used toooo, oh yeah)

You used to love them, leave them, kiss them (break their little hearts)
Break their hearts, but now I got you in my arms (you did baby)
You used to get them, trick them, diss them (yes you did)
Do them wrong (do them wrong), but now your playa days are gone (oooh yeah)

You used to love them, leave them, kiss them (You used to love them)
Break their hearts, but now I got you in my arms (baby I got you where you belong)
You used to get them, trick them, diss them
Do them wrong (do them wrong), but now your playa days are gone (now they're gone)

You used to get them, trick them, diss them
(Yeaaah) But now your playa days are gone (Ooooh yeah)

Hey, hey, hey yeah, hey
Hey, hey, hey yeah, hey
