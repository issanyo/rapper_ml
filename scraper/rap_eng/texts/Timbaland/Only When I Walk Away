[Verse 1]
Girl, this little game you play
You don't stop 'til you go too far
So what's a man like me to say?
With a bullet laying in my heart
Damn love, we go from so hot to so cold
What am I gonna do about this damn, love?
Is this shit insane or insane love?
I guess that's the way we play it

[Chorus]
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, but only when I walk away

[Verse 2]
What's that, baby, what you say?
'Cause you don’t want to light up this torch
'Cause I'll burn it down all the way
Burn it down 'til there ain't no more
Damn love, how did this sound get so amp'd up
Turn off and silence this damn love
Is this shit insane or insane love
I guess that’s the way we play it

[Chorus]
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, but only when I walk away

[Bridge]
Cold, so cold, yeah
Cold, so cold, yeah

[Verse 3]
You should see the look on your face
Baby, when I finish what you start
I can’t hear a word you say
With a bullet laying in your heart
Damn love, how did this shit get outta my hands love?
I laid you to rest you say (Damn love)
This shit’s insane, it’s insane love
Ain’t that the way we play it

[Chorus]
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, but only when I walk away
