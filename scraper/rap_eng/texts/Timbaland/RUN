[Intro]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, bitch
It's Doktor Avalanche
Huh, huh, huh
Water!
Yuh, ayy
Okay

[Verse 1]
Think I'm on the Animal Planet with this snake belt buckle
But it the Gucci, so don't you dare chuckle
Not a mechanic, but this tool might clutch it
No chicken nuggets, but my sauce been busting
Bitch, it go harder than when Chris Brown krumping
No no, bitch, it go harder than bread crumbs in the summer
How much of gas do you burn like a Hummer?
Okay, how many bitches you made wet like a sauna?
Bitch, my feet no Morty, but Rick Owens
Scary side posted like scarecrowin' (wet!)
I'm at yo' head like a hair sew in (hair)
Hide-and-seek, where is your hairline going? (hair)
Make the AK sound like some titties I motorboated
Can't bite my sauce 'cause it's poison coated
My flow get you going like locomotive

[Chorus]
Run motherfucka, run motherfucka, run
Run motherfucka, run motherfucka
If there’s anyone to fear up under this damn sun
In this god-forsaken land, then he is one
Run motherfucka, run motherfucka, run
Run motherfucka, run motherfucka
If there’s anyone to fear up under this damn sun
In this god-forsaken land, then he is one

[Verse 2]
Yuh, made me sick
Keep one eye at 'em like Slick Rick
I'm buggin' out like an insect
Fingers on his bitch like Tech Deck
Her mouth on my wood like go fetch
Fox on my feet, my coat mesh
Head scratch, how much is that?
It cost a living like human head, umm
I'm gone like the wind, high like Peter Pan
Cut like Mr. Clean, but I'm in his head
Like serial killer, I murdered again (bitch)
But only the track; it's my favorite sin (water!)
So that’s how you know that this song not your friend
Consider it evil, and this is the end
But when in your nightmares, I reappear again (ayy)

[Chorus]
Run motherfucka, run motherfucka, run
Run motherfucka, run motherfucka
If there’s anyone to fear up under this damn sun
In this god-forsaken land, then he is one
Run motherfucka, run motherfucka, run
Run motherfucka, run motherfucka
If there’s anyone to fear up under this damn sun
In this god-forsaken land, then he is one
