[Intro: Timbaland]
Love me, baby
Say what, love me, baby
Ha ha, remix
Love me, baby
Say what, love me, baby
'Face, bring it in, what

[Verse 1]
Girl, it's been a long, long time comin', yes it has
But I, I know that it's been worth the wait, yes
It feels like springtime in winter
It feels like Christmas in June
It feels like Heaven has opened up its gates
For me and you, yeah

[Chorus: Babyface + (Mariah Carey)]
And every time I close my eyes
I thank the Lord that I've got you
(That I've got you, baby)
And you've got me too
And every time I think of it
I pinch myself 'cause I don't believe it's true
That someone like you loves me too, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Babyface + (Mariah)]
Oh, girl, I think that you're truly somethin'
And you're, you're every bit of a dream come true
With you baby (with you, baby)
It never rains and it's no wonder
The sun always shines when I'm near you
It's just a blessing that I have found somebody like you

[Chorus: Babyface + (Mariah Carey)]
And every time I close my eyes
I thank the Lord that I've got you
(That I've got you, baby)
And you've got me too
And every time I think of it
I pinch myself 'cause I don't believe it's true
That someone like you loves me too

[Bridge: Babyface + (Mariah)]
To think of all the nights I've cried myself to sleep, yeah
You really oughtta know how much you mean to me
(Oh, it's only right) It's only right (you're in my life)
That you be in my life right here with me
Oh, baby, baby, yeah (yeah, yeah)

[Interlude: Timbaland]
Love me, baby, huh
Luh-luh-love me, baby, the remix, ha
Love me, baby, ha
Luh-luh-love me, baby, Timbaland
Luh-luh-luh-love me, baby, Babyface
Luh-luh-love me, baby, remix, ha ha
Love me, baby

[Mariah + (Timbaland)]
Every time I close my eyes
(I close my eyes, say what)
You've got me
And every time I think of it
(Every time I think of it, ha ha, say what
Ha ha, say what, say what, we out)

[Outro: Timbaland]
Don't you bite it
Don't bite my beat
Don't bite my beat, what
Don't bite my beat, what
Don't bite my beat
