[Verse 1]
You've got a faded sky
You've got no breathing room
You got a wasted life
You got nothing to do

[Chorus]
Get up, get off the floor
I said get up
Do something more
You need a backbone, to roll with the world
You gotta get you one to run with the bulls
(You ready)
(You ready)
(Get ready)

[Verse 2]
You got pint of blood, you got a losing hand
You put a house of cards, on a hill of sand

[Chorus]
Get up, get off the floor
I said get up
Do something more
You need a backbone, to roll with the world
You gotta get you one to run with the bulls
(You ready)
(You ready)
(Get ready)

[Verse 3]
You got a fatal flaw
Skeleton made of straw
Images on the wall
Keeping you in the dark
You're in a pack of wolves
Trying to live alone
If you're gonna be a mole
Crawl back inside your hole

[Chorus]
Get up, get off the floor
I said get up
Do something more
You need a backbone, to roll with the world
You gotta get you one to run with the bulls
(You ready)
(You ready)
(Get ready)
