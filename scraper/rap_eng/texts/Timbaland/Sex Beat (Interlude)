Ahh... it's time to slow it down for a bit
Like this
Oooh, ahhhhhh
I call this here... take off your drawers music
Hehehe
This is for the ladies
Hahahah
Do you hear my voice, ladies?
Ladies? Hah
See I don't disrespect no woman
As long as she don't disrespect me, see what I'm sayin?
I would never call a girl, that B word
Never call you no ho
All I wanna do is lick on your toe
And, pull off your, tight Girbauds
Ahhhhhhh, huh
Ahhhh, huh, oh you wanna pour me a glass of wine?
I already got mine
How bout you pour yourself some
Know what I'm sayin?
Alright, like my boyz 112 said
Only you baby
You know what I'm sayin?
But enough for the humpin
Say what say what?
