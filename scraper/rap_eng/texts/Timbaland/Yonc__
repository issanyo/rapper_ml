[Verse 1]
See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls
Posted in the back, got my fangs and my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up tell me how I'm looking babe

[Breakdown]
Boy this all for you just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking babe
Just tell me how it's looking babe
I do this all for you baby just take aim
Just tell me how it's looking babe
Just tell me how it's looking babe
How it's looking, how it's looking babe

[Verse 2]
Drop the bass mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "speed it up", I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't never seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off your tongue
'Cus when he wanna smash I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
