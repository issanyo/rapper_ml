I ran into some girls who knew you today
They tried to tell me some things
But I know there's always two sides to a story

I don't give a damn about what others say
They just can't see you gettin' close to me
I don't give a damn about what happened before me
There's always two sides to a story

I don't give a damn about what others say
They just don't want you gettin' close to me (No, no, no)
I don't really care about what happened before me

There's always two sides to a story (First verse)
I don't understand why it's happening
And I'm tryin' to ignore the things I hear
People saying things all up in my ear
And I'm wondering is it the truth I fear

You don't need to explain, 'cause baby, I don't care
Whatever happened then was then, then was then
All that really matters, girl, that it's you and me
Whatever was then is gone, we can't change it now

I don't give a damn about what others say (Oh)
They just can't see you gettin' close to me (Close to me, yeah)
I don't give a damn about what happened before me
There's always two sides to a story (There's always two sides to a
Story, mmm, hmm)

I don't give a damn about what others say (Mmm, no)
They just don't want you gettin' close to me (They don't want you
Gettin' close to me, no)
I don't really care about what happened before me
There's always two sides to a story (Mmm, hmm)

Met some others girls and they started tellin' me
How you used to carry on back then with them
And they tried to tell me things like you ain't changed one bit
But they ain't there to see the things I see

You don't need to explain, I just want you to know
It starts from now and not back then, then was then
All that really matters, girl, that it's you and me
Whatever was did, it's gone, it's history

I don't give a damn about what others say (I don't give a damn)
They just can't see you gettin' close to me (See you gettin' close)
I don't give a damn about what happened before me
There's always two sides to a story (There's always two sides to a story)

I don't give a damn about what others say (Yes, it is)
They just don't want you gettin' close to me (Want you gettin' close)
I don't really care about what happened before me (Baby, can you tell
Me
One thing)
There's always two sides to a story (Can we go)

On and on and on and on and on and on and on
Can we go on and on and on and on and on and on
Can we go on and on and on and on and on and on
Can we go on and on and on and on and on and on

I don't give a damn about what others say (No)
They just can't see you gettin' close to me
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't give a damn about what happened before me (Mmm, hmm)
There's always two sides to a story (There's always two sides)

I don't give a damn about what others say (There's always two sides)
They just don't want you gettin' close to me (No, no, no, no, no)
I don't really care about what happened before me (I don't give a
Damn)
There's always two sides to a story ('Cause there's always two sides
To
A story, baby)

I don't give a damn about what others say
(Oh...they don't want you getting close to me)
I don't give a damn about what happened before me
(No, I don't give a damn what happened before me)

I don't give a damn about what others say
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't really care about what happened before me (I don't give a
Damn
No, no, no)
There's always two sides to a story (All I know is that I love you
Darlin')

I don't give a damn about what others say (Mmm)
They just can't see you gettin' close to me (All I know is that I need
You)
I don't give a damn about what happened before me
There's always two sides to a story (Oh, I don't care about what
Happened before me, baby)

I don't give a damn about what others say
(They're just jealous of you and they want your place)
I don't really care about what happened before me (No, no)
There's always two sides to a story (No, no)
