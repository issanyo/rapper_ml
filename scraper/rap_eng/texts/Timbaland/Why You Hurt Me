I know there somebody out there who had a nasty
Nasty friend who wanna go around humping everybody
Can I get a ho? You know what I'm saying? So
I'mma talk about this one I had a fewa years ago

I had a friend named Cutie Tootie
Tootie turned tricks to get some Gucci
Known as loose bootie
Truly, she was a freak in the evenin
And if she wasn't teasin, then give me one reason
Why she do dat? Always knew dat
She was hot as da nectar
Hector said he pecked her, direspected her
Cause he bang bang swang in his dingalang
Broke his back long range
And make the ugly bitch sing

Oooh oooh
Why you hurtin me?
Tell me why more
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
Why you hurtin me?
Tell me why more
Oooh oooh

Cutie Tootie with her sight
And if she humped Ralph
She humped Bobby, Ricky and Mike
Tight, is the way she wore her dresses
Has she learned her lesson
From all the dick testing
Now I'm guessing
She's laying in a casket
In a yellow basket
For a Gucci jacket
Daggit, I wish she didn't do those nasty things
Cause he made the ugly bitch sing

Chorus

Tootie didn't know the facts of life
Staying up in clinics
Loosy bootie made trife
Feeling, she got the heeby geebies
Quick to give you freebies
Underneath the staircase in Brooklyn
Neighbors out the window sure was lookin
She greasy like chicken
I don't give a cotton pick and
She can do her thing
Cause me and her don't hang
The ugly bitch sang

Chorus

So you know what? This should be a lesson for anybody
Who's hanging with someone who's dirty, nasty, stank
Once again going around humping everybody
Everybody and anybody and anything
That's why you make the ugly bitch sing
