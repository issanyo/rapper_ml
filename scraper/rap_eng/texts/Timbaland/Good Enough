[Verse 1]
I gave you all of me
But it still ain't enough to make you happy
I gave you everything
It still don't measure up
It feels like I walked 5 thousand miles
And didn't even come close
Feels like I try to make you smile
But you don't even care, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never be big enough to pay your dues
But i keep trying
And you just keep on making me jump through hoops
What do I got to do?

[Chorus]
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be worth your love
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough
And see that i can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough

[Verse 2]
I try to show you that I'm strong
Why do I even bother?
Cause it's the same old damn song
And you call yourself a father
Feels like I'm reaching for the stars
But heaven isn't letting me
I wish that I had longer arms
But I know that will never be never be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never be big enough to pay your dues
But i keep trying
And you just keep on making me jump through hoops
What do I got to do?

[Chorus]
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be worth your love
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough
And see that i can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough

[Bridge]
Look at me
I'm standing right here waiting for you, here I am
Look at me
Lookin' for your acceptance, do you give a damn?
Look at me
See it doesn't matter what you think, I'm still a man
Look at me
Open up your eyes, can't you see that I'm good enough

[Chorus]
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be worth your love
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough
And see that i can be
Good enough, good enough
Good enough
