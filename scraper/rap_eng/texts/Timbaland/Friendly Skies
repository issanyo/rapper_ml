[Verse 1]
Kiss me, hold me
The weatherman says it's gonna be
Cold tonight (whatever man)
(Whatever whatever whatever whatever)
Whatever man, you wanna do
I'll be the pilot
Don't miss your flight

[Chorus]
I'm stewardess of the plane
Can you feel the turbulence and maintain? (maintain)
Please refrain, stay in your seats
Until we reach the gate (until we reach the gate)
I'm stewardess of the plane
Feel the turbulence and maintain
Please refrain, stay in your seats
Until we reach the gate

[Verse 2]
Take me higher
Let's just go for a little joy ride (whatever man)
(Whatever whatever whatever whatever)
Let's stay buckled up
And let's make love across the friendly skies

[Chorus]
I'm stewardess of the plane
Can you feel the turbulence and maintain? (can you, can you, ooh)
Please refrain, stay in your seats
Until we reach the gate (until we reach the gate)
I'm stewardess of the plane
Feel the turbulence and maintain
Please refrain, stay in your seats
Until we reach the gate

[Bridge]
I want you (baby)
Baby, baby I want you (I really want ya)
I really, really wanna (fuck) you
Boy, you're no shy (1:39?)
I want ya
I want you
Baby, you know, I
Baby, baby, I want you
I want ya, I want ya, I want ya
I really, really wanna fuck you (oh yeah)
Sho nuff wanna fuck you
I really, really wanna fuck you, yeah
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

Is there anything that you want?
Is there anything that you need?
Just call on me, call on me
Call on me, call on me

[Outro]
Want you
