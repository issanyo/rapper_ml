[Intro: 50 Cent]
I rock a nigga to sleep
Roc-roc-roc-a-bye baby
Roc-roc-roc-a-bye baby

[Hook]
You should be dead by now
Smile but wait until my shooters come round
With the talons and hollow tip rounds
In my hood they know how I be down (Nigga I say dead, you dead)
You should be dead by now
Smile but wait until my shooters come round
With the talons and hollow tip rounds
In my hood they know how I be down (Nigga I say dead, you dead)

[Verse 1]
Yeah I show you my teeth all through the beef
Paint the sidewalk red with the back of your head
Shootouts in my hood like a daily routine
D's think I'm involved when a nigga hit hard
So when that hammer hit the shell and the hollow tip fly
Nigga you can cross your heart and hope not to die
Come through squash the drama, send niggas with llamas
To heat your ass up fuck being masked up
I was given the gift of life
From Sabrina since then I've been jammed up and bucked with the nina
Nana raised nine kids I turned out the meanest
I mean a menace
Fuck with me and your finished

[Hook]
You should be dead by now
Smile but wait until my shooters come round
With the talons and hollow tip rounds
In my hood they know how I be down (Nigga I say dead, you dead)
You should be dead by now
Smile but wait until my shooters come round
With the talons and hollow tip rounds
In my hood they know how I be down (Nigga I say dead, you dead)

[Verse 2]
Homie I always pay my debts when I owe a nigga bullets
Got an arsenal, infantry and niggas to pull it
Go ahead, style on me get done with, it's nothing
I chase a nigga down and touch him, catch him and bust him
Bitch get out the way, baby while I spray it
I wet a nigga like a hydrant on a hot summer day
But you can catch me in May riding round with the 'K
Better watch what you say, we get it popping today
Yeah me I make it hot round here, I call the shots round here
I have a nigga tear off your top down here
This the land of broken hearts, where bullets shatter dreams
And everything a nigga is worth is on the triple beam
South Side!

[Hook]
You should be dead by now
Smile but wait until my shooters come round
With the talons and hollow tip rounds
In my hood they know how I be down (Nigga I say dead, you dead)
You should be dead by now
Smile but wait until my shooters come round
With the talons and hollow tip rounds
In my hood they know how I be down (Nigga I say dead, you dead)

[Outro]
Roc-roc-roc-a-bye baby
Roc-roc-roc-a-bye baby
