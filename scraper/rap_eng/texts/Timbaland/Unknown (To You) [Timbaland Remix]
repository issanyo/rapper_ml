[Verse 1]
I believe what I say
Why does everyone hear me wrong?
If I told you different, would it sound the same?
Would it make a difference in anyway? Oh, no
I know I done wrong, I'll pay for it
It's your turn to talk for once I'm listening

[Chorus 1]
Say that you don't want me
Say that you don't need me
Tell me I'm the fool
Tell me you've been tortured
Tell me you've been beaten
And what I've done to you
Even if it doesn't matter
Matter what's true
Say that you don't want me
Say that you don't need me
Tell me I'm the fool

[Verse 2]
Look at all this heartache, what is left?
Forgetting how it started, this is how it ends, oh no
I know I've done some wrong, I'll pay for it
But it's your turn to talk, for once I'm listening

[Chorus 2]
Say that you don't want me
Say that you don't need me
Tell me I'm the fool
Tell me you've been tortured
Tell me you've been beaten
And what I've done to you
Even if it doesn't matter
Matter what's true
Tell me that I'm unknown to you

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus 2]
Say that you don't want me
Say that you don't need me
Tell me I'm the fool
Tell me you've been tortured
Tell me you've been beaten
And what I've done to you
And even if it doesn't matter
Matter what's true
Say that you don't want me
Say that you don't need me
Tell me I'm the fool

[Outro]
Tell me that it's over
Tell me that you mean it
This time is true
Tell me that I'm unknown to you
