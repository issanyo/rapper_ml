[Hook]
You wanna handcuff me
But yo I don't know what to tell ya (Don't know what to tell ya)
You want my intimacy
But yo I don't know what to tell ya (Don't know what to tell ya)
You wanna wall around me
I swear I don't know what to tell ya (Don't know what to tell ya)
You want my lock and my key
But yo I don't know what to tell ya (Don't know what to tell ya)

[Verse 1]
Incarceration what I'm facin'
When I'm witchu
You're watchin' my every move
Tryin' to pick up on some clues
We play twenty questions
Every time I walk in or out the door
What do you bother for? (What do you bother for?)
Get comfortable it's yours...

It's gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep our L-O-V-E
It's gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep our L-O-V-E
Crackin'
Stressing and second guessing
Many time and time again
We go from lovers back to friends
Got to put this to an end

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
No justification for your actions
Should have been somewhere relaxin'
Don't compare me to your last one
I can't help it she was a fast one
A sassy one, I'm a classy one
I can't keep them from getting at me hun
Seems like that should make you happy hun

It's gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep our L-O-V-E
It's gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep our L-O-V-E
Crackin'
I can't deny it why I try to put up with you
These insecurities everyday
Pushing my love away...

[Hook: 3x]

It's gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep our L-O-V-E
It's gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep our L-O-V-E
It's gonna take, It's gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep our L-O-V-E
It's gonna take, It's gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep our L-O-V-E
Crackin'
