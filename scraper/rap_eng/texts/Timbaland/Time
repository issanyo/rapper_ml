[Verse 1]
We don't talk like we used to
The perfect present is no longer the future
And i can't find it, trust me I looked around
Seems like all the sand is at the bottom now

[Chorus]
We gotta know, know when to fight, know when to hold, and when to let it go
I hope we survive because it's passing by
I won't be surprised if it all up and blows
Time, time, time
(If it all up and blows)
Time, time, time, time
(I wish we could rewind)
Time, time, time
(I wish we could rewind)
Time, time, time, time
(I wish we could rewind)

[Verse 2]
We are the shore, the wave is rising
We are the dust made out of diamonds
When metal rusts, we are all drowning
Island of man, we are surrounded

[Chorus]
We gotta know, know when to fight, know when to hold, and when to let it go
I hope we survive because it's passing by
I won't be surprised if it all up and blows
Time, time, time
(If it all up and blows)
Time, time, time, time
(I wish we could rewind)
Time, time, time
(I wish we could rewind)
Time, time, time, time
(I wish we could rewind)

[Verse 3]
Make a little love, make a little war, tell me how it feels dreaming without a future
Have a little laugh, have a little cry, each moment gets us closer to saying goodbye
Have a little laugh, have a little cry, each moment gets us closer to saying goodbye
Big hand keeps getting closer to the little hand all good things come to an end and turn around again
The big hand keeps getting closer to the little hand all good things come to an end

[Chorus]
We gotta know, know when to fight, know when to hold, and when to let it go
I hope we survive because it's passing by
I won't be surprised if it all up and blows
Time, time, time
(If it all up and blows)
Time, time, time, time
(I wish we could rewind)
Time, time, time
(I wish we could rewind)
Time, time, time, time
(I wish we could rewind)

[Outro]
Time, time, time
(If it all up and blows)
Time, time, time, time
(I wish we could rewind)
Time
(Time, time, time, time, time)
Time, time, time, time, time, time
(I wish we could rewind)
I wish we could rewind
I wish we could rewind
Smoking on a cigarette, my six pack's right beside me
Smoking on a cigarette, my six pack's right beside me
Smoking on a cigarette, my six pack's right beside me
Smoking on a cigarette, my six pack's right beside me
Beside me, beside me, beside me, beside me, beside me, Beside me, beside me, beside me, beside me, beside me, Beside me, beside me, beside me, beside me
