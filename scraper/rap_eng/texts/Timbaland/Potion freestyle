(Intro)
Huh, yuh, uh

(Verse 1: SLEEPER°)
Fiji water, grandaddy purp
Pussy off the pedestal, let the semi squirt
D.R.I.P. M.O.B. motherfucker call me bread alert
You throwin' ones, bitches throw it back while they on percs
Yuh
Gave her dick, made her head burst
Addicted to the flavour
She call me Starburst
Rollin' marijuana, lick the wood first
Excuse me, I let the semi-automatic burp
Fiji water, Skywalker OG
You think you know me
I'm ghost like Ben Kenobi
Finna flow free
Floating like a spirit, call me holy
Put it down for Asian brothers, when I bleed I bleed shinobi
Yuh
I bleed shinobi
Haters try to clone me but they don't know how to zone me
Bitch, I'm a one man team you could call me Kobe
Sip Fiji smoke the OG
Tippin off the syrup call me 666
Smokin' on the jitt, she smokin' on my dick
Purple tape it's only built for Cuban links
Penny for your thoughts
A dollar for your dreams
And so it seems
Cash rules everything around me

(Bridge: B-Real & The Notorious B.I.G.)
B-Real: Like a puppet on a string x8

The Notorious B.I.G.: Tremendous C.R.E.A.M
Fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams
Cho-choppin' O's, smokin' la in Optimos
Money, hoes and clothes: all a nigga knows
Tremendous C.R.E.A.M
Fuck a dolla- fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams
A foolish pleasure
Whatever
I had to find the buried treasure
So grams I had to measure

(Verse 2: SLEEPER°)
Bugattis and Maseratis
Pipe dreams, since a youngin' always frothed a Rari
12 wanna see me do time, wanna see me scurry
Will I be locked? I'm praying to the Mahdi
Dreading it like rastafari
Pull up with my demons ain't in a hurry
My Sprite is muddy
Stove on my waist, guess you could say I'm cookin' curry
From ninas to subpoenas, my arresting officer wanna press felonies
There ain't no pretendin' B
Had to hit the merit for apologies
Whip it on some tabs
Crab bitches asses, assessment for the lads
Bad bitches, backwoods and packs of the Mads Mikkelsen
Nickelin' a half dime of a bag (swerve)
Haters on my ass, tell them birds hit the perch
Gatorades and gas, Mary never let me hurt
Ya heard
The prophet told me it won't be easy
I used to slang while listening to Eazy

(Bridge: B-Real)
Like a puppet on a string x8
