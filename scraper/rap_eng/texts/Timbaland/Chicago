[Verse 1]
I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I
So I asked her for her name

She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that
Was really into me

[Chorus 1]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can
(She was loving me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
(She was wanting me)
She said just to give her a place
Fifty nine was the code she gave
(She was loving me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Thought she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I never would have thought she was living like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near
She would tell me how she feels

It felt so real to me
This girl, she had to be
An angel sent from heaven just for me

[Chorus 2]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can
(She was loving me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
(She was loving me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
(She was loving me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Thought she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

She tried to live a double life
Loving me while she was still your wife
(She was wanting me)
She thought that loving me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
(She was loving me)
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
(She was wanting me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Because she had a family, family
Yeah

Why.. Ooh no
Alright
Ohh
(I’m in love, love)

[Verse 3]
I didn’t know she was already spoken for
‘Cause I’m not that kind of man
Swear that I would’ve never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that I’m holding her to blame

[Chorus 2]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can
(Holding her to blame)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
(Holding her to blame)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
(She was loving me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Thought she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

She tried to live a double life
Loving me while she was still your wife
(Holding her to blame)
She thought that loving me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
(Holding her to blame)
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
(Holding her to blame)
She lied to you, lied to me
Because she had a family, family
Yeah

[Chorus 2]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can
(She was loving me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
(She was loving me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
(She was loving me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Thought she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

She tried to live a double life
Loving me while she was still your wife
(She was wanting me)
She thought that loving me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
(She was loving me)
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
(She was wanting me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Because she had a family, family
Yeah
