[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
I'm gonna put on my dancin' shoes and find a crazy outfit
'Cause tonight it's all about you
I can't wait to show you all my new moves
I got a brand new two-step (two-step)
You're gonna like this outfit (outfit)
I got it all right here
No need for you to go anywhere (anywhere...)
Anywhere (anywhere...)

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Turn it up until it can't rock anymore (Mr. DJ)
Look at what you made me do out on the floor (that's when we say)

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
(Hey, hey!) We belong to the music, we don't answer to you
(Hey, hey!) That's right we ain't movin, we don't answer to you
It's a party, we can dance if we want to
C'mon and party, like it ain't no curfew
(Hey, hey!) We belong to the music, we don't answer to you

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
I'm gonna call up my friends
Gonna have a good time, it's sure to be crazy
Tonight, it's all about us
Feelin' real good, can you blame me?
I got a brand new hairdo (hairdo)
To fit my brand new attitude (attitude)
You can't tell me nothin'
Ha, I ain't bluffin'
I'm tellin' you (tellin' you...)
I'm tellin' you (tellin' you...)

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Turn it up until it can't rock anymore (Mr. DJ)
Look at what you made me do out on the floor (that's when we say, hey)

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
(Hey, hey!) We belong to the music, we don't answer to you
(Hey, hey!) That's right we ain't movin, we don't answer to you
It's a party, we can dance if we want to
C'mon and party, like it ain't no curfew
(Hey, hey!) We belong to the music, we don't answer to you

[Refrain: Timbaland + Miley Cyrus]
What, what'cha say now?
