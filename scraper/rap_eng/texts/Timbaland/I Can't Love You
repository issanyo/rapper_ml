(Chorus)
I can't love you the way you wanna be loved
So that's all, for us
Just pack your bags and hit the road
There's nothing left for you and me to discuss

I can't love you the way you wanna be loved
So that's all, for us
Just pack your bags and hit the road
There's nothing left for you and me to discuss
I can't love you

(Earl Hayes)
I ain't even mad I'm just sick of your shit
Only time I'm happy now is when you suckin' my dick
I'm drunk all day you can hear the ice in my glass
Rumblin', the neighbors scared
Cause they seen your naked dumb ass runnin'
You must be happy when I call you bitch
Smack you in the face and tell you pack up all your shit
But this is what happen' when you ain't know you fuckin' with his street
Find out and be like 'she can't be in public with me'
I'm a boss I'd rather blow my balls off then be called a clown
By real niggas when they talk
But you usually hear my name come up when
Murders get brought up
One in the circle with dealers when them niggas talk drugs

(Chorus)

(Earl Hayes)
I ain't even sad, I'm just sick of your mouth
The more I hear you talk the more I want you out of my house
I get to whoopin on your ass like I'm crazy
See you cryin' hard and curlin' up like a baby
You owe me, I payed all your bills, that god damn car of mine
I beat your fucking ass, they call it domestic violence
I hear you on the phone sayin' “Hayes, don't call the cops”
Then you come back in the house, talking shit, like you're fucking rocky
You'd probably be happy with another man
You do a lot of dumb shit I don't even understand
I don't wanna go to jail so I'm cooler than a fan
I'd kick you in your ass before I hit you with my hands

(Chorus)
