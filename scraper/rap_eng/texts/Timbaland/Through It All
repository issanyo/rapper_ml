[Verse 1]
Life's thrown many punches
Trying hard to knock me out
It's hard but I'm fighting
Can't let my faith waiver now

Change don't always feel good
But I know that it's working for me
As long as I keep standing
You'll give me the victory

[Pre-Chorus]
Because you promised in Your Word
That You will never leave me
You will never leave me nor forsake me, no

[Chorus]
Through it all, You're with me, yeah
Through every tear, through every pain, Lord
Through it all, You're with me, yeah
Every mountain high, every valley low

[Verse 2]
Ooh, sometimes I feel alone
My heart is broken, shattered
It hurts but I'm trying (It hurts but I'm trying, Lord)

They say "don't ask your questions"
But Lord why me? (Why me?)
If You trust me with it
Then You'll give me the victory

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know what you said in Your Word
That You will never leave me
Nor forsake me

[Chorus 2]
Through it all You're with me
Through every tear, through every cry, Lord
Thank You for being right there
Thank You for hearing every cry
Every mountain high, every valley low

[Bridge]
Because I have Your promise
I will stand tall
Your Word requires that I
I'll be strong
Lord to follow in Your presence
I'll risk it all, You'll be right there
Through it all
And we'll say all

[Tag]
You say you'll never leave me
You say you'll never left me alone
You say you'll never leave me
You say you'll never leave me
And you've never ever left me alone

[Chorus]
Through it all, You're with me
(You've been right there)
You'll never leave me nor forsake me, Lord
Through it all
(I thank You, Lord)
You're with me, yeah

[Chorus 2]
Oh, through it all
I've learned to trust in Jesus
I've learned to trust in God
Through it all
Oh, through it all
Stand on Your every word

[Outro]
When my friends forsake me
My Momma and Daddy couldn't do it
I can call on You, Lord
You've been right there
You've been right there
Through it all
