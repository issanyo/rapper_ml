[Verse 1]
Watchin' myself and I'm taking strides
But here comes the moon
And it feels, and it feels like an informer
Quick, run away, hide before they see you
You know it is all, all aglow

[Verse 2]
Walking on water seems perilous now
You got my trust
And it feels, and it feels like sabotage
But I'm pulling triggers back on myself
And you know it is all I know, it's all I know

[Chorus]
And it feels so real from the outside looking in
And it feels so real from the outside
From the out, from the out
Tyrant
Tyrant

[Verse 2]
Capable of almost anything
This crippled bird's gonna sing, gonna bring you all the answers
Turn around, look, your shadow's cooking up beautiful
Lies for you, that's what they do

[Chorus]
And it feels so real from the outside looking in
And it feels so real from the outside
From the out, from the out, from the out, from the out
Tyrant

[Bridge]
I'm stained with apathy
I'm blind, but I can see
A tyrant to the bones, yeah
I'm stained with apathy
I'm blind, but I can see, oh
Don't justify me
Don't justify me, yeah
Justify me, yeah
Don't justify me
Justify
Justify me
No, no, no, no...

[Outro]
From the out, from the out, from the out
From the out, from the out, from the out
And it feels so real from the outside looking in
