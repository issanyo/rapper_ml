[Verse 1]
You see a fresh off the grill nigga keepin it hot
Now watch it spread all through the hood I'm back controllin the block
With one of rap's greatest ever Timbaland production
Y'all niggas know just what to do; go 'head, follow instructions
When the God's in the building (get down!)
Uh-huh; I know you niggas know the feelin (get down!)
Alright; and if you ready and you willin (SAY YO!)
Okay; throw your hands to the ceiling (get down!)
Alright; go 'head and stack another million (get down!)
Jumpin around like you ain't really carin (get down!)
Ladies rippin off everything they wearin (HEY YO!)

[Verse 2]
Until the block start blowin blowin up (get down!)
Uh-huh; and e'rybody throwin up (get down!)
'Til they got the fire marshall showin up (get down!)
Or until the club start closin up (get down!)
Okay; see how a nigga walk through 'em when the beat put a spark to him
Let me just talk to 'em (LADIES) quit'cha man
Go 'head put them plans off (LADIES) well okay
Go 'head and piss your man off (LADIES)
Take your pants off and shake it for 'em (SHAKE IT LIKE A DOG FOR 'EM)
And put your ass on 'em (SHAKE IT LIKE A DOG FOR 'EM)
Go 'head and spaz on 'em (SHAKE IT LIKE A DOG FOR 'EM)
Now put the mash on 'em (SHAKE IT LIKE A DOG FOR 'EM)
Okay; now from the root to the tree to the top of the building

Well okay; and if you with me say it (DO-DOH-DOHHHHH, DO-DOH-DOH)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah - well okay; and while you niggas party shit I spit a jewel for the thug
Before a nigga try to front make sure your tool in the club
That ain't the basis of this shit, though it's true when it's love
They'll have you niggas whylin like a fuckin fool on the drug
Now if you with me muh'fucker (get down!)
Uh-huh; we gettin gizzle muh'fucker (get down!)
Word to God; we make it sizzle muh'fucker (get down!)
Uh-huh; I'm on my grizzle holla back (OWWW!)
Well okay; see how the God bounce back while you niggas just sound sloppy
Givin you niggas shit they'll be knowin you can't copy
The way the God be spillin all over the track
Get off my dick, tell your bitch holla back (OWWW!)
C'mon; violate with me up in the spot is a no-no
A lot of niggas shit trash, soundin all so-so
Shinin so much D's takin my photo
Lower the brim of my fitted while I try to be low-pro
We gettin mo' cheddar while you stuntin with no dough
Gotta skip the line shit movin in slow-mo
Shorty whylin out, try to hit with a low blow
With her crotch on my thigh, rubbin all on her cho-cho
SHAKE YO' SHIT 'til you fall on the flo'
Sho' we be fuckin class bitches, I ain't fuckin with no ho
Bust two shots - let me hear it (BO! BO!)
'Til the security get para' when they callin the po'-po'
If you with me say it (DO-DOH-DOHHHHH, DO-DOH-DOH)
