[Intro: Cardi B]
And even if any of you bitches
Any of you bitches could take my nigga away from me
Y'all gotta live the rest of your life with him sick then
Cause any hoes he go to, every nigga gonna tell him
"Damn my nigga how can you leave Cardi for this bitch right here"

[Hook: Tink]
You can have my ex nigga bitch he ain't shit
I was never really into him he had a little dick
I just knew it when I cuffed him shoulda never fucked him
Drama queen nigga always gotta make assumptions

[Verse 1: Tink]
Weak nigga had to leave his ass in the dust
Type of nigga go and tell a hoe what we discussed
I was dumb enough to talk back, boy you got me off track
Bitch delete my number, had to send that shit in all caps
And now I'm on some new shit with this money now
Tell my bitch let's run it up another hunnid thou
Fuck relations i'm impatient like my pawn star
Holding all these bands what the fuck I need your man for
Right, doesn't make sense
I'm the best he ever had in the past present tense
Um, right and that's without a doubt
These dog ass niggas so I might kick him bout

[Hook: Tink]
You can have my ex nigga bitch he ain't shit
I was never really into him he had a little dick
I just knew it when I cuffed him shoulda never fucked him
Drama queen nigga always gotta make assumptions

[Verse 2]
I ain't trippin on no ex
You lil bitches be obsessed
Only reason that he with you is cause I was unimpressed
You ain't really in my league, I was cooling off a breeze
Ain't no nigga on the planet that can run circles on me
You's a freshman big bottles only in my section
Clearly I been winnin no election
Don't go through his texts, he told me let's meet up at the Weston
Said he wanna know just why I left him
I'm fine wine, he was in the left lane
Do yourself cause I see through you you like a window pane
Bitch mad cause you hooked up on my coat tail
Hit her with that oh well took her to that motel

[Hook: Tink]
You can have my ex nigga bitch he ain't shit
I was never really into him he had a little dick
I just knew it when I cuffed him shoulda never fucked him
Drama queen nigga always gotta make assumptions
