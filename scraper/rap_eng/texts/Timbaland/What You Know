[Verse 1 Johnny Jc]

Flow Sick Mike Vick 2 Pits
Fightin Tyson Homie you might get bit
Temper like a bomb and you lit that wick
That's like putting Casey Anthony in a room full of kids
Door locked with a shotgun cocked
At the next mother fucker that's trying to call the cops
Psycho?
Nah i'm sociopathic
Mom wrapped in plastic and shoved in a trash bin
So Uh?
HUH What the fuck are you asking
Did i kill anybody am i really that sick?
No i got tired of getting my fucking ass kicked
So i tied the bully up and dripped him with acid
Told y'all i had an alter ego
He fucking hates people this bastard's evil
When he comes around it's like pins and needles
Everybody's on edge like the purge was legal
He don't sing for hoes so deceitful
Brass knuckles to ya face like i'm William Regal
You rock a chain like Jibbs but where he at now?
Probably in a crack house cuz rap didn't work out
I don't like pop bitches Fuck Pastele
Paintin ass ho sit you motherfucking ass down
So fuck you with a spike bat
And i give two shits if you don't like that
My whole crew crazy apes
Gambino on the camera that's homicide on tape
Reppin Jersey all day come protest your wake
You came in the world but you left as a fake
I dont like that shit
Make plates shift when i spit like this
Third Eye bitch fuck the rest
I'ma make sure i'm the one you won't forget
Mother fucker

[Hook]


[Verse 2 Rick The Raw]

Nigga
Kamikaze on the waistline
Spitting crack on the beat now that's dope lines
Putting bodies in the ground like a phone lines
Kill'em all in 6 seconds put it on vine
And I'm fine like a cute face nice ass
Slim waist type a chick i might bag
Daredevil so i'm Evil Kenevil
Catch Zimmerman and poke'em with double needles
His attorney didn't like it i'll round house kick em
Dont be a motherfucking Third Eye victim
Tryna put my hood on
[?]
Kurt Cobain nigga that suicide
Who am i man i'm nothing like these newer guys
When you out with the face of a clown
You king the of the city you ain't safe with the crown
You bout to get smoked like an 8th or a pound
Never liked the circus so i clap at the clown
Wanna see how real i am?
Put the beats on niggas like Will I Am
Niggas really want they ass kick
Cuz we roll real deep like a mosh pit
And we got shit locked like bad pick
Leave you stabbed in you niggas like Brad Pitt


[End]
