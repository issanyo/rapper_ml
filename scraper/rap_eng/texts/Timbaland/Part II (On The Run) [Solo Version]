Who wants that perfect love story any way, anyway
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah
An innocent love un-misunderstood, yeah
Black hour glass, hour glass
Toast to cliché is in a dark past
Toast to cliché is in a dark past

I don't care if we on the run
Baby, long as I'm next to you
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out
The best in you

I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, no
I know it's crazy but

They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing to lose

I don't care if they give me life
I get all of my life from you
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you

I hear sirens while we make love

I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, no

Without you I got nothing to lose

I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
