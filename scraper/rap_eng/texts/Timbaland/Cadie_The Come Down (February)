[Verse 1: Robb Bank$]
Now she trippy man, but I'm level
Telling me things that she prolly wouldn't tell you
Hair falling out of that bun and them heels is done
You gon' fall if you ain't careful bitch
In my ear screaming don't tell you shit
My niggas say you wanna be careful with
Now she crying like she don't even know I'm here
I'm tryna drive with the loss of motor skills
Got contacts in her phone to get her over me
Her eyes ain't red cause she crying over me
Talking so loud, reading me all her texts
Hallucinating, saying that I look like her ex
Lay down on that couch, it's cool you can stay
Can't move, I feed you teaspoons of that drank
I say fuck the bed and tablespoon if you freaky
From the way you opened up, I can tell that you easy
Say you lost your phone, need to look in my car
Talking 'bout you feel sick, Princess, don't start
And I lay your ass down in that pale moonlight
Whisper sweet nothings while we look up at the stars
You smoked a whole dub and popped three bars
And your tits ain't real so what that say 'bout your heart?
Picking a good girl, never been good at that
Need some pussy, more money, man I gotta Kat Stacks
Yea I told you nigga, your bitch'll slide up
Put my plug down her socket like she Terri Schiavo
My niggas in this bitch, squatted in the front
And my dick up in your bitch while she laying on her back
Phone not in her car, found it in her bag
Found hickeys on her neck, call that purple swag

[Hook]
She about Tiah Tolliver
And me, I'm pile driving her
I give her what she wants, and she letting me inside of her
Showed her how to live, now she showing me a side of her
She never knew exsisted, I swear I'm training these bitches

[Verse 2: Robb Bank$]
Now she don't kiss and tell, but she scream when she fuck
Confide in me when y'all gotta disagreement
All my eggs in one basket, my hair look like a nest
So I got the chicken breast from the runaway phoenix
Ex-beauty queen that just lost her pageant
Her and her man relationship lost it's passion
Said she want to taste my cup, no questions asked
Shit, you expect me not to take a little advantage
Tears dried on her face, got ash on her dress, bra strap hanging off that cold shoulder
Got her answering my front door, in the morning with my bed sheet wrapped around her like a toga
I told ya, Vans, no loafers
In all corduroy like I'm matching with the sofa
When I show out, I blend in
No parental consentin', my bitch becoming fly as a Ford Agency bitch

[Verse 3: Young Neil]
She go down low, down low
Do everything a real nigga ask you
What you down for, down for?
Better be everything I want
But if it ain't girl don't even come
But tell me, where all them hoes at
That don't give a fuck where they clothes at
That don't give a fuck about roll backs?
Just throw it back, put your legs where my shoulders at
All out wit' it and no holding back
Nigga going out with her don't know at
But, that's cool, fuck that nigga
Leaves you when you say you love that nigga, don't trust that nigga
Where you at, where you at? He creepin' behind your back
You ain't gon' do shit, you ain't 'bout that nigga

[Break]

[Robb Bank$]
Yea, he be that gritty motherfucker

[Verse 4: Matt Meyer Lansky]
Marlboro what I'm smoking
No more rolling tree because that boy be on probation
Cigar rebel racing, never been a racist
Know a lot of Hatians even though that boy caucasian
Never been afflicted, never been complacent
Never wrote a statement cause that boy don't talk to Jacob
Always rockin' Rolex, just copped that new bracelet
Only watch the boy and never copped up in a Jacob (?)

[Break]

[Verse 5: Matt Meyer Lansky]
Ok, now let's begin
Got a bitch half Indian, half Mexican
Cook me up that curry, clean my crib and then she blessed the dick
A$AP, aye bruh, you took that name from Aesop
I put you on them cookies if you looking for that straight drop
That head chop, incurred
And if you lookin' for that straight slut
Why don't you call yo' bitch? She the one that left my cum straight ate up
And if you want that MSG, come get that dose like "Why not?"
Rest in peace, I'll buck fifty yo' chrome with a click of that tight Glock
Bitch I'm repping Springs, never hear me yelling "SoFla"
My city is so hot, them Sherrifs all on your block
Gots to pay that homage, catch the kid on South Beach
JK, I be poppin' right off Dixie like your mouth piece

[Break]

[Verse 6: Matt Meyer Lansky]
We out in P-No, where my dawgs be clockin' all them C-notes
Hialeah, where we rock the boat on hoes like I'm Aaliyah
Big bang is my adlib, my onomonopia, ho
Put you in that coffin and get in your mausoleum, no

[Break]

[Verse 7: Matt Meyer Lansky]
You just a silly mothafucka, pussy what you reppin'
I just use my fist, no converse, I don't need no weapon
You just a silly mothafucka, pussy what you reppin'
I just use my fist, no converse, I don't need no weapon
