Intro:
You can thank me now...go 'head
"Thank him later", yeah I know what he said
But frankly, I must say I wasn't impressed
So it's okay!
You can thank me now...instead
Apologize the People's Mixtape's abridged
But I swear you'll love it when I Digress

Verse:
I got a tome full of heat
And a tomb full of beats
But the recording of those tracks
Don't match the songs on the sheets
So what you own is incomplete
Although my foes can't compete
With my raps that just sound wack
Played back in low quality
So what you think now
'Cause this ain't no sucky freestyle
I can hit em with a rhythm and get em
Filling prescriptions of the ether that I spit
And watch them freak out
Wow! Pretty wild
Hot lines of that chili powder
Words put in your mouth, but it's not mild
So they're cheering louder
(Ahhh!) Get it? That's why I had to go
Get this new equipment so you'll pick this over trash so
Overplayed today decaying brains
So change the game's the saying, right?
The same old song's being made to long
Just like a Saiyan fight
But now the dragon's gonna do what he wish
Which is using his gift to make funky hits so get a whiff
And sense what I have in common with pens
And that's the "Papermate", just call us fraternal twins
No relation to uncalled ruckus
'Cause I've been ready to roll like on call truckers
And live up to my name like one called Busta
Rhymes, so I Fiya-Blast none call rubbish
So on the real here's the deal like a discount
With this out, jockeys wanna dismount or flip out
'Cause this a free peek, that you can put on repeat
To let my rep proceed me by "Vash the Stampede"-ing

Outro:
You can thank me now...go 'head
"Thank him later", yeah I know what he said
But frankly, I must say I wasn't impressed
So it's okay!
You can thank me now...instead
I know I got my Pyros bobbing their heads
'Cause they love it when I lyrically wreck
But I Digress...
