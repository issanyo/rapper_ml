[Intro: The Hives]
The time has come, flyweight champion of the world!
(Flyweight champion of the world)
The time has come (hey girl)
The Hives

[Verse: Timbaland]
Take it to the back of the club
Fast talkin, don't take this the wrong way
I've been peepin that ass
And if you give me my chance I ain't gon' play
I really want to get to know ya
That's what I told ya girl you know I don't play
(OW!)
I wanna put it in your - WHOA girl~!
You better do what the song say

[Hook: The Hives & (Timbaland)]
Uhh, just throw it on me; uhh, just throw it on me
Uhh, just throw it on me
(wiggle that ass before you throw it on me)
Uhh, just throw it on me; uhh, just throw it on me
Uhh, just throw it on me
(wiggle that ass before you throw it on me)

I got so many broads
White cars I can jump in two or three in the same day
(WOO-OO)
And when I park my car
Soon as I walk in the spot women say (OW!) They ...
Showin' me titties
And they callin my name and all night God damn babe
(SHUT UP!)
Niggas is hatin me
Cause they girl wanna throw that thang on me like it's okay, girl!

[Hook: The Hives & (Timbaland)]
Uhh, just throw it on me; uhh, just throw it on me
Uhh, just throw it on me
(wiggle that ass before you throw it on me)
Uhh, just throw it on me; uhh, just throw it on me
Uhh, just throw it on me
(wiggle that ass before you throw it on me)

[Verse: Timbaland]
From the look of at that ass
You probably a "Gold Digger" but I ain't Kanye
Baby girl you're on the right track
But you're goin' the wrong way
And when we leave out the party
Baby girl I got the game that we gon' play
And when ya wake up tomorrow
I'll be on the highway
(peace)
HEY!!

[Hook: The Hives & (Timbaland)]
Uhh, just throw it on me; uhh, just throw it on me
Uhh, just throw it on me
(wiggle that ass before you throw it on me)
Uhh, just throw it on me; uhh, just throw it on me
Uhh, just throw it on me
(wiggle that ass before you throw it on me)

[Outro]
Right...
... before you throw it on me
Right - The Hives
(just throw it on me)
THE HIVES - JUST THROW IT ON MEEEE~!
Just throw it on meee, just throw it on meeeeeeeeeeeee
(Uh-uhh)
Throw it on meeeeeeee, oooh yeahhh
