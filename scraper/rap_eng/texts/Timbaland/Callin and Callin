[Verse 2: Young Crazy]
I'm not meanin' to be rude man
But Crazo baby is just a fool man
Tell U-Haul they can hire me
Cause all a nigga do is move thangs
Bitch called said I'm a joke
Only call her when I wanna stroke
Had to ask the bitch a serious question
How you judge me and ya' daddy broke?
Jeweler called said the ice was in
Told his ass I'm gonna buy a coat
Crazy accountant in my fucking way
Told yo ass to go and buy a boat!
My only aspiration money makin'
Make some money nigga why you hatin'?
Contemplating on what I'm makin'
While I'm dinner datin' with a couple Asians
Never worried 'bout you dissin' on me
I'm understanding that you livin' lonely
You're out there seein' all your bitches on me
Say you seein' cash but your vision phony
Have an attitude you can come and get me
I don't even need niggas with me
If I up the ratchet ain't no missin' with me
Quarter back the shots it's the precision in me

[Chorus: Breeze Barker]
Fuck with the plug he be callin' me (callin' me)
Ain't about money quit callin' me  (why?)
Outta yo' league in this season (what?)
No wonder yo' bitches keep callin' me (why?)
No wonder my plugs keep on callin' me (what?)
Count it, I counted quit callin' me (why?)
Yeah, they must see that I'm ballin' (what?)
They callin', they callin', they callin' (yo)

(Dough boy, dough boy) No wonder yo' bitches keep callin' me
(Dough boy, dough boy) No wonder yo' bitches keep callin' me
(Dough boy) No wonder my plugs keep on callin' me
(Dough boy) Count it, I counted quit callin' me
(Dough boy) Yeah, they must see that I'm ballin'
(Dough boy) They callin', they callin', they callin' (dough boy)
