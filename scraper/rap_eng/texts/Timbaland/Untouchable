Verse 1:

You're crazy if you fuck with this, yes I'm stuck in this, ulterior line, spreading fear in your mind, throughout
I was a listener of rap until my ears blew out
Now I don't give fuck about who's out
I'm the best that I hear now
And seeing you here deer, proves the hunting season's year round
I know you don't like when shit's exaggerated
Apologizes that my asshole isn't fabricated
Infatuated, yet exasperated, by the state of this
And I won't rest until I lay to this
What's patent, is absent. In these raps
But cheddar will have these rats, in cheese traps
So you shoot me twice in the same hole
Ill still come out a coma half retarded and still have the same goal
It's like the rap I've hated, beens agitated 
And what I've abated, has activated
The envy, within me
I guess I should put it more simply
But it's not so simple, when all the smoke goes out window
See your difference, doesn't make the slightest difference
And I'll have persistence
Until the shit's pushed in
And every face is mushed in
No facial recognition
It's nothing personal. It's just my mission
Until I finish this shit, then I'll replenish the clip
Then go back in
Motherfucker when I'm rapping I'm...


Verse 2:

I'm forcing this down your throats and making you stomach this
Blow you all away when I bring a gun in this
But with a close mind, I fire blind
So even if you're in or out the way, in
Alleyways, of any hideaways
Doing your best to stay astray
Will still get you hit with the ricochet
See the rhymes are pushing the hate through
To the point where I suffocate you
Then resuscitate you, and do it over forty more times
Shitâ€™s brutal but now I got stories for rhymes
And what's to come bout
When all the bread and butter talk runs out
Are wrapped in these shell casings
And it'll have you in a choke hold
As I poke holes, in all your fucking sale ratings
So if you care about your value I'm warning ya
Cuz I haven't even cracked through the formula
This is only a fraction, of what's packed in
And stacked in every entity
Is an enemy
So I'll have no serenity
Until the end of me
And even then
I'm only even when, I'm bringing in
Those who aren't even in
To the foreground
Splitting you in half when I put more down
The construct, of the onslaught
Is on thoughts
So after I snuff ya soul
I'll crush ya skull cuz I'm...
