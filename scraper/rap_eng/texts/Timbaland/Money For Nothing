[Sample:Sting]
I want my MTV

[Intro: Yazz]
Consumers, silver spooners
It's nothin', we get money for it

[Verse 1: Jussie Smollett]
Commas and zeros, that's the way we do it
We make it work in this economy
Rollin' dinero, pockets stay polluted
Money is dirty and we don't play clean
We chasin' paper, run, run, hurry, move it
Get out the way if you ain't 'bout that green
Intensive labor, taxes are included
Ain't nothin' in this effin' world for free

[Pre-Hook: Jussie Smollett]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs

[Verse 2: Yazz]
We are the people who turn illegal to legal
We take the good with the evil, create more sales than the Beatles
And the lion's our logo, we the sharks in the water
Multimedia moguls, more offices than the oval
We do everything, pull up in the game to entertain
Finish it by any means necessary
(Finish it by any means necessary)
We everywhere, millionaires, billionaires, visionary
Back to business, let's just spend, think it in and celebrate

[Pre-Hook: Jussie Smollett]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs

[Hook: Yazz (Jussie Smollett)]
(Move that work, move that work)
Commercialize, commercialize
(Get that work, get that work)
To advertise, to advertise
(Make it work, make it work)
Look mom, I'm on TV
(Gotta make it work, make it work)
Hi mom, I'm on TV

(Move that work, move that work)Commercialize, commercialize
(Get that work, get that work)
To advertise, to advertise
(Make it work, make it work)
Look mom, I'm on TV
(Gotta make it work, make it work)
Hi mom, I'm on TV


[Bridge: Jussie Smollett (Yazz)]
My talent's worth a fortune (500)
They know that I'm a boss
I got the ice flossin'
I'm all about my business (all about my money)
I'm all about my business

My talent's worth a fortune (500)
They know that I'm a boss
I got the ice flossin'
I'm all about my business (Yeah)
I'm all about my business

Yeah
You know what it is

[Hook: Yazz (Jussie Smollett)]
(Move that work, move that work)
Commercialize, commercialize
(Get that work, get that work)
To advertise, to advertise
(Make it work, make it work)
Look mom, I'm on TV
(Gotta make it work, make it work)
Hi mom, I'm on TV
