[Verse 1]
Little girl, I love when she talks to me
Got the smile, when she walks that walk with me
I want the girl, but I want a lot
Might cross my mind, but that's where it stops

[Chorus]
Ohhhh
That bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of me
I said no, that bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of me
I said no, that bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of me
I said no, that bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of-part of-part of me

[Verse 2]
I love the girl, I'm lovin' the dress she wears
She's got a hold, got a hold of my neck, oh yeah
I wanna cry, the way that she moves
I want the girl, but not what she's going through

[Chorus]
Ohhhh
That bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of me
I said no, that bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of me
I said no, that bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of me
I said no, that bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of-part of-part of me

[Verse 3]
She was so friendly, I had one too many
But now that they tell she was rubbing up against me
But I swear, never meant a thing, she was just a fling
There's no other woman who does it like you

[Chorus]
Ohhhh
That bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of me
I said no, that bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of me
I said no, that bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of me
I said no, that bitch ain't a part of me
No, that bitch ain't a part of-part of-part of me
