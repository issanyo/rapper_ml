[Chorus: Jack Gilinsky]
That's the last thing that I want
That's the last thing that I want, oh baby
That's the last thing that I want
That's the last thing that I want
Can we just leave the expectations at the door
No stipulations
Say it again
That's the last thing that I want
That's the last thing that I want

[Verse 1: Jack Gilinsky]
Tryna get hurt
Is he tryna draw blood?
Wanna be responsible for dragging our hearts through the mud
If we got a connection
Why you tryna pull the plug?
Do you want that negative energy placed on us

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Gilinsky]
All of these questions, don't ask why
All these emotions don't sit right
No, we don't need complications for you and me
Don't say them words

[Chorus: Jack Gilinsky]
That's the last thing that I want
That's the last thing that I want, oh baby
That's the last thing that I want
That's the last thing that I want
Can we just leave the expectations at the door
No stipulations
Say it again
That's the last thing that I want
That's the last thing that I want

[Verse 2: Jack Johnson]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, I just wanna have a good time with you
Baby, tell me why did you said what you just said
I ain't gon' lie, it's kinda makin' me upset
Those three words back to back to back, fuck that
Cuz I ain't tryna get much deeper than the surface
Yeah, that's why I snorkel instead of scuba divin' in the ocean
Let it be known that I'm hopeless when it comes to romance
Like damn, there's no need to slow dance, no ma'am
Groove with me, aye
Up tempo
Let loose with me
Get up out your feelings
Out your blues with me
Your body language's so beautiful
I'm perusing it
I ain't tryna take it to a new limit, baby no

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Gilinsky]
All of these questions, don't ask why
All these emotions don't sit right
No, we don't need complications for you and me, for you and me
Don't say them words

[Chorus: Jack Gilinsky]
That's the last thing that I want
That's the last thing that I want, oh baby
That's the last thing that I want
That's the last thing that I want
Can we just leave the expectations at the door
No stipulations
Say it again
That's the last thing that I want
That's the last thing that I want

[Post-Chorus: Jack Gilinsky]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's the last thing that I want
That's the last thing that I want
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's the last thing that I want
That's the last thing that I want

[Verse 3: Jack Gilinsky]
Who holds your feelings, babe?
Don't make it difficult, no
Don't be expecting that
Expecting the same thing from me, no
We ain't gonna let each other down now
Each other down now, no
Just as long as your right here with me
Don't say them words

[Chorus: Jack Gilinsky]
That's the last thing that I want
That's the last thing that I want, oh baby
That's the last thing that I want
That's the last thing that I want
Can we just leave the expectations at the door
No stipulations
Say it again
That's the last thing that I want
That's the last thing that I want

[Post-Chorus: Jack Gilinsky]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's the last thing that I want
That's the last thing that I want
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's the last thing that I want
That's the last thing that I want

[Bridge: Jack Gilinsky]
Don't be saying the words
Don't you just say the words I don't wanna hear
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna hear
Don't just say them words I don't wanna hear
Don't you say the fucking words
Don't you say them words, don't you say them words
Don't you say them words, don't you say them words
