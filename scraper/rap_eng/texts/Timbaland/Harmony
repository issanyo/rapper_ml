[Intro: Timbaland]
Together never, together, together
Together nev-

[Verse 1: Dalton Diehl]
We were born to fly, limitless
No matter what, we stay up
If we're a team that is enough
No boundaries, we're fearless
Where we go on, we go all
We never break, we never fall

[Pre-Chorus: Dalton Diehl]
In this world that we're creating
Magic's all around
We can fly above the ground

[Chorus: Dalton Diehl]
Hey yeah, we should come together
Let's be heroes in the night (in the night)
Black spotlights beaming in the black sky
We can lift the darkness with our light
'Cause everybody's in harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Everybody's in harmony
Harmony
Harmony

[Verse 2: Dalton Diehl & Timbaland]
Whenever chaos (Kaos) gets crazy
Trouble knocks on the door
With your heart above the floor
Keep shining, yeah, keep trying
If something's wrong we'll be strong
Face your fears until they're gone

[Pre-Chorus: Dalton Diehl]
In this world that we're creating
Magic's all around
We can fly above the ground

[Chorus: Dalton Diehl] 2x
Hey yeah, we should come together
Let's be heroes in the night (in the night)
Black spotlights beaming in the black sky
We can lift the darkness with our light
'Cause everybody's in harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Everybody's in harmony
Harmony
Harmony

[Outro: Timbaland]
All together, harmony
We're all together in harmony
