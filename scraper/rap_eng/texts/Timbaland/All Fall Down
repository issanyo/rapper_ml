[Verse 1]
Step out the door and it feels like rain
That's the sound, that's the sound on your window pane
Take to the streets, but you can't ignore
That's the sound, that's the sound you're waiting for

[Pre-Chorus]
If ever your world starts crashing down
Whenever your world starts crashing down
Whenever your world starts crashing down
That's where you'll find me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, God love your soul and your aching bones
Take a breath, take a step, meet me down below
Everyone's the same, our fingers to our toes
We just can't get it right, but we're on the road

[Pre-Chorus]
If ever your world starts crashing down
Whenever your world starts crashing down
Whenever your world starts crashing down
That's where you'll find me, yeah

[Chorus]
Lost 'til you're found
Swim 'til you drown
Know that we all fall down
Love 'til you hate
Strong 'til you break
Know that we all fall down

[Pre-Chorus]
If ever your world starts crashing down
Whenever your world starts crashing down
If ever your world starts crashing down
That's where you'll find, find me

[Chorus]
Lost 'til you're found
Swim 'til you drown
Know that we all fall down
Love 'til you hate
Strong 'til you break
Know that we all fall down

[Breakdown]
All fall down, we all fall down, all fall down
We all fall down, we all fall down, all fall down

[Outro]
Lost 'til you're found
Swim 'til you drown
Know that we all fall down
Love 'til you hate
Strong 'til you break
Know that we all fall down
