[Verse 1]
I coulda stayed in that place too long
I would've made it okay for you to do me wrong
I would've played the role one more day
If I didn't hear my conscience say

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop, look around
This is where you belong
Look at yourself, are you weak?
Are you strong?
I realized that it's all up to me
To make myself happy

[Chorus]
Finally I walked away
Never would've seen this day
Givin' up on those things that hurt me
Made me who I am today
Finally I walked away
Never would've seen this day
Givin' up on those things that hurt me
Made me who I am today

[Verse 2]
Looking back on my choices made
Thinkin' about the things I did to make you stay
I wonder sometimes why my love
Didn't turn to hate
But then I hear the same little voice
Inside me say

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop, look around
This is where you belong
Look at yourself, are you weak?
Are you strong?
I realized that it's all up to me
To make myself happy

[Chorus]
Finally I walked away
Never would've seen this day
Givin' up on those things that hurt me
Made me who I am today
Finally I walked away
Never would've seen this day
Givin' up on those things that hurt me
Made me who I am today

Oh...

[Bridge]
Finally, I'm where I'm suppose to be
Finally, I'm where I'm suppose to be

[Chorus]
Finally I walked away
Never would've seen this day
Givin' up on those things that hurt me
Made me who I am today
Finally I walked away
Never would've seen this day
Givin' up on those things that hurt me
Made me who I am today

Oh...

[Outro]
Finally, I'm where I'm suppose to be
Finally, I'm where I'm suppose to be
Finally, I'm where I'm suppose to be
Finally, I'm where I'm suppose to be
Finally, I'm where I'm suppose to be
Finally, I'm where I'm suppose to be
