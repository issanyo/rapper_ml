[Verse 1]
I’m no stranger to deception
I have lied and been lied to
I’m no paragon of virtue
But I want to be with you
I have never been a righteous soul
And I don’t pretend I am
But I walk the line when I’m with you
Because you make me believe I can

[Pre-Chorus]
But we’re running out of options
And we’re running out of time
And I don’t know if it’s you or me
But it’s time to speak your mind

[Chorus]
Because I’m traveling across the sky
When you’re with me, your hand in mine
Our honesty will make us fly
And we’ll be traveling across sky
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Across the sky (oohhhhh)

[Verse 2]
I’m not good at keeping quiet
And I can’t keep this tied down
But it’s got to count for something
That we’re still hangin’ around
If you need an explanation for
What is false and what is true
Then I’d rather stop the world than think
That I could not be with you

[Pre-Chorus]
But we’re running out of options
And we’re running out of time
And I don’t know if it’s you or me
But it’s time to speak your mind

[Chorus]
Because I’m traveling across the sky
When you’re with me, your hand in mine
Our honesty will make us fly
And we’ll be traveling across sky
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Because I’m traveling across the sky
When you’re with me, your hand in mine
Our honesty will make us fly
And we’ll be traveling across sky
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
Across the sky (oohhhhh)
