[Chorus]
She don't like me cuz I'm handsome
When she drunk become a dancer
Just a girl she wanna have fun
Taking trips yo boy is random
Bitch so bad she throw a tantrum
All my homeys with me active
All my homeys Sipping actav
Money calling Im'a answer
If it ain't we gon hit cancel
Getting money dodging hassles
Doggy style but I'm the asshole
She don't like me because I'm handsome
Think she like the way I'm swagging
Better harder stronger faster
She don't like me cuz I'm handsome
When she drunk become a dancer

[Dex Verse 1]
Dadadex I'm in the country
What African that Isn't Hungry
Snatch ya food and change the subject
Anatomy my favorite subject
Learn the girl en body movements
Turn the girl to only movement
Sakawa and Ronnin movements
Gimme brain don't be stupid
All this slang u no fi catch it
Real music no be advert
In my own lane I swear down
This my flow e no be average
Funeral and open casket
Murder beats I know it's tragic
Made the beat and wrecked it after
Rest in peace u helpless bastard

[Chorus]

[Dex Verse 2]
AMG at purple pub
Niggas ain't hurting us
Really need a verse from us
Truth can hurt and it hurt to trust
Funds my trap on kick starter
First wasn't earning much
Till I learned to turn it up
Burnt my clutch and hit my target
Afro trap that be the market
Bad hoes play for us
Kente thong I laced em up
With the, product taped Under!
Trying to ,steal the, game from us
Suarez in quarter finals
So much kush a quarter Kylo
Kilo nigga I'm just high as fuck

[Chorus]
