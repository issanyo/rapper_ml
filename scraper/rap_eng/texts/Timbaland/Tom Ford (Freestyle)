[Verse]
My nigga I’m a road dog and all my dogs on the road
Don’t put your fingers on my whip or that bitch might explode
Some say it’s sucka proof, if you’s a trick I can tell it
I sprayed my whole damn whip with broke nigga repellent
Step away from the vehicle wish it could all be so simple but you’s a groupie
And I bought that whip right there with a cheque that I got from a fucking movie
Luda! Hollywood, Hollywood, nigga
But still rappin’ like I just got out the hood nigga
College Park where I been, Southside I’m locked in
We double-parked on my block so my block got you blocked in
I dare your ass to say something or we might just take something
Open up that can of Raid and this Glock might just spray something
You insect, we been prepped, you get wet from these ten tecks
Shoot it out, stab it out, or knuckle up and get chin checked
I’m a lover not a fighter, a nibbler not a biter but I’m all about that life dog
Try to break in my house and you might find your wife dog
But you also gonna see two dogs that attack and is ready take a bite out your ass
You could try to fight it but I’m here to let you know
I can guarantee that your fight won’t last
You gon’ be dead meat, nigga, puppy chow
I’mma be like ‘ding ding ding ding ding!’ who else is hungry now?
Come and get it my dogs’ll chew and spit it
Your body’s a wishbone and this chopper will come and skid it
Ludacris, I’m kinda crazy with these metaphors
And been with ol’ bitches gettin’ great skull like Skeletor
Big sword like He-Man, women want this seed man
Two Glocks like 2Pac, jackass like Wee Man
Time to lose that rooftop, I don’t start no key man
Decorate this Ludacris, Miss, light up that tree man
Smoke some’
