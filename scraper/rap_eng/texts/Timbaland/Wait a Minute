My pager rings, I pick it up and you tellin me that your girl peeped
Me
In my Range Rover, Rollin down the ave pumpin out my new hits
I think to myself it's cool, so i keep reading and it's you sayin that
She
Saw me cheatin
Now i'm all confused baby, then i get a grip it's just a little thing
That
I'm dealin with
Why she hatin on me, i don't really know what this is all about but
I'm
Finding out
Then my mind wanders , start thinking back at the party when she was
All up
In My face and up
On me
And grabbing on my arm and telling me things like how she was the bomb
Now for me it's clearer, that instead of you you don't see the truth
But she
Wants me near her

(course)

(ginuwine)
Now don't believe a thing your girl say, she wants to have what you
Have all
It is is jealousy baby put your trust in me
She really wants to ride my pony, but you're the one im giving it
You're
The one i'm living with, giving all my stuff and shit
So why you wanna doubt our love, don't let her break our world, before
You
Question me you need to check your girl
She done dished out more then she can take and her ass can't handle it
But you're my woman and we're one and I'm not having it
But it's alright, yes it's ok
I'm sure you believe in me and i'm sure you can see the truth in me
Baby

(course)

Fellas, wave your hands, if you know what i'm talkin bout
Girls, come to G, if you all are feelin me
(repeat)
Fellas, pump your fist, if you know what i'm talkin bout
Girls, come to G, if you want to get with me
(repeat)

(course)
