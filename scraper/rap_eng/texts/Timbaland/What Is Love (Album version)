Ohh Ohh, Ohh Ohh, Ohh Ohh, Ohh Ohh

[Verse 1]
I would tell you that I love you tonight
But I know that I’ve got time on my side
Where you goin'? Why you leavin' so soon?
Is there somewhere else that’s better for you?

[Chorus 1]
What is love if you’re not here with me?
What is love if it’s not guaranteed?
What is love if it just ups and leaves?
What is love if you're not here no more?
What is love if you’re not really sure?
What is love? What is love?

[Verse 2]
Tell myself I wouldn't cry when you're gone
But I know it's easier said than done
Look at me, look at me choked up now
Try to tell you but it won't come out

[Chorus 2]
What is love if you’re not here with me?
What is love if it’s not guaranteed?
What is love if it just ups and leaves?
What is love if you're not here no more?
What is love if you’re not really sure?
What is love if it just ups and goes?

[Bridge]
I can’t live without ya (I can’t live without ya)
I can’t live with ya (I can’t live with ya)
What goes around will come right back around
You won't know 'til it hit ya
We were supposed to be
We were supposed to be
We were supposed to be an empire

[Chorus 2]
What is love if you’re not here with me?
What is love if it’s not guaranteed?
What is love if it just ups and leaves?
What is love
What is love if you’re not really sure?
What is love if it just ups
