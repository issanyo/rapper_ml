I've been thinking 'bout us
And the things we've been thru
It's time we got serious
You know I would like to
But we need to work out these issues
Before they get out of hand
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I know we've been for sin and arguin'
But the fact is
Unity is a good thing
It took a while for me, but now I see
Though some will love you
That same will hate you
Sometimes they'll scream and curse you out
Just try to chill and ride it out
But it's official, when I'm against you (I'm in love)
And I feel it's wrong, more in spite
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side
I've been looking at our history
Things ain't changin' but they need to be
Where do we start?
Seems like it's gone too far
Can't we just try to work it out
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I know we've been for sin and arguin'
But the truth is
Unity is a good thing
It took some time for me, but now I see
Though some will love you
That same will hate you
Sometimes they'll scream and curse you out
Just try to chill and ride it out
But it's official, when I'm against you (I'm in love)
And I feel it's wrong, more in spite
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side
I'm so sorry I treated you so bad
But I didn't realize what a friend I had
I regret the things I did and you can believe that
I apologize, wish I could take it back
Sometimes I loved you
That same will hate you
Sometimes they'll scream and curse you out
Just try to child and ride it out
But it's official, when I'm against you (I'm in love)
And I feel it's wrong, more in spite
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side
