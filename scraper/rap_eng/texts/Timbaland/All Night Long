[Verse 1: Demi Lovato]
I love the way you're talking
I'm loving what you're doing, boy
I don't fall easy often
I've never had a love like you before

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I like you
Put your number, put your number in my phone
Phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, yeah
You heard me right
So, call me, call me when you're all alone
-Lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Don't make plans
Come home with me, we'll stay up all night long
I want you, and I want you bad
Let's keep the party going all night long
Let's keep the party going all night long
All night long, all night long
All night, all night
All night long, all night long
All night, all night
All night

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
I'm on another planet
I'm in another universe
You may not understand it
Sooner or later, baby, you will learn

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I like you
Put your number, put your number in my phone
Phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, yeah
You heard me right
So, call me, call me when you're all alone
-Lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Don't make plans
Come home with me, we'll stay up all night long
I want you, and I want you bad
Let's keep the party going all night long
Let's keep the party going all night long
All night long, all night long
All night, all night
All night long, all night long
All night, all night
All night

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
Let's go
We could party all night, night
Want to spend a night, night
Well, you be my type by the end of the night
We could pillow fight
Your kisses real nice
Come closer, 'cause I don't bite
You talking how I like
You play daddy, I play wife
I'm so alone, no one is home
I got your, got your number in my telephone
Wanna, wanna, wanna be your girl
Wanna, wanna, wanna be my man?
Well, we can hold hands, write our names in the sands
It's the weekend, don't make plans

[Bridge: Demi Lovato, Timbaland, Both]
Party starts, when you're here
After dark, we don't care
We gon' set it off
We gon' set it off
Party starts, when you're here
After dark, we don't care
We gon' set it off
We gon' set it off

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Don't make plans
Come home with me, we'll stay up all night long
I want you, and I want you bad
Let's keep the party going all night long
Let's keep the party going all night long
All night long, all night long
All night, all night
All night long, all night long
All night, all night
All night
