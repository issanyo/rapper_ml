Yo, turn my music up
Up some more, Up some more
Up a little bit more

[Verse 1]
Mama always told me to be careful who I love
And daddy always told me make sure he's right
I always had my eyes on this one particular guy
I was too shy so I decided to write

[Chorus]
I'm sending him a 4 page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him he better get it on time
I'm sending him a 4 page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him he better get it on time

[Verse 2]
People always say that I've played myself for you
They say that you don't even notice me
Baby when I get the nerve to come to you
Promise me that you won't dis me

[Chorus]
I'm sending him a 4 page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him he better get it on time
I'm sending him a 4 page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him he better get it on time

[Bridge]
I'm writing you a love letter tonight
You better keep watch cause the mailman's coming
I'm writing you a love letter tonight
You better keep watch cause the mailman's coming

[Chorus]
I'm sending him a 4 page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him he better get it on time
I'm sending him a 4 page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him
He better get it on time
