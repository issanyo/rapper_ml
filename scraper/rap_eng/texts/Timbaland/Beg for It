Can you say Omarion?
There's just something I wanna do to you
I been watchin you all night long (2x)

(Chorus)
Beg For it
Don't panic, when you see it you betta hold on
You said you need it, well damnit come on
Imma lay right here while they play my song
And watch you beg for it
Take that off, when you go in there you betta get it all
Dont play wit it baby, go head get it all
Imma beg for you baby as soon as you get all

(Verse 1)
Ain't neva had body make yo hood friends
Ask you "how long does he give it"
Baby, get ready to know (they ain't ready)
For the play, I'm a game
When its up, I'll make you

(Chorus)
Beg For it
Don't panic (hey), when you see it you betta hold on
You said you need it, well damnit come on
Imma lay right here while they play my song (play my song)
And watch you beg for it
Take that off (hey), when you go in there you betta get it all (get this)
Dont play wit it baby, go head get it all (hit this)
Imma beg for you baby as soon as you get all

(Verse 2)
Ain't no me lovin you, ain't no you lovin me
This is strictly because, when we came in free
No we were chosen for
Understand whats the dress code
Dont be mad if I ain't playin for keys
Damn Imma do, all those things in my dream
On my hood in the cold
While its raining on us
When I get it I'm gone, you gon let all ya girls know
Ain't gon be no second guessing bout me

(Chorus)
Beg For it (ho!)
Don't panic (whoo), when you see it you betta hold on (hold on)
You said you need it, well damnit come on
Imma lay right here while they play my song (while they play my song)
And watch you beg for it
Take that off, (ooo) when you go in there you betta get it all (ooo yeah)
Dont play wit it baby, go head get it all (come on)
Imma beg for you baby as soon as you get all

(Hook)

You can get it, oo yeah

Can I get a hit on the dance floor, can I get it (ooo)
Can I get a hit on the dance floor, can I get it (oh)
Can I get a hit on the dance floor, can I get it (hey)

(Chorus)
Beg For it
Don't panic, when you see it you betta hold on
You said you need it, well damnit come on
Imma lay right here while they play my song
And watch you beg for it
Take that off, when you go in there you betta get it all
Dont play wit it baby, go head get it all
Imma beg for you baby as soon as you get all
