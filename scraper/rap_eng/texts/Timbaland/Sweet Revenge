[Verse 1]
Everybody out for my blood, everybody want my percent
I don't want to start going off, I don't want to start talking shit
They just want to take what is mine, how much more can they get
I already know what they want, I already know what they spent
Nowadays I think like a moment, why they looking for blood
I'm about to get what they owe, gonna get back what they stole
Let me talk to the fans, every time I walk in the door
They just want to take my advance, but I won't stop till they know
Walk with me now

[Chorus]
When I retaliate, you're gonna know
The mourning of sweet revenge
Pain and suffering will come to those when I get even
It's such a
Sweet revenge
Sweet revenge
Sweet revenge
Sweet revenge

[Verse 2]
I bet they won't stop till I quit, I bet they won't leave till I go
Ain't gonna hurt me a bit, one monkey won't stop the show
I've been through dirt and sand, traveled to foreign lands
Been to hell and come back, I ain't gonna go there again
Why they wanna cause me to trip, why they wanna see me take a fall?
They wanna get something for nothing, wanna see me jumping and running
Let me talk to the fans, never gonna stop doing this
Till I'm deep in the ground, come way too far to give in
Walk with me now

[Extended Chorus]
When I retaliate, you're gonna know
The mourning of sweet revenge
Pain and suffering will come to those when I get even
It's such a
Sweet revenge
Sweet revenge
Sweet revenge
Sweet revenge
When I retaliate, you're gonna know
The mourning of sweet revenge
Pain and suffering will come to those when I get even
It's such a
Sweet revenge
Sweet revenge
Sweet revenge
Sweet revenge
