[Intro]
(Can't believe you're gone)
(Can't believe you're gone)

[Chorus 1x 2]
What did I do to deserve this pain
I'm crying out
I'm so alone without you here
What's this about?

[Verse 1]
I can't go on
I need you here right next to me
My life ain't complete
I'm dying inside I feel so weak
I'm pouring out my heart to you
Feel my pain it hurts so deep
There's no need to go ahead
My life is gone I'd rather be dead

[Chorus 1x 2]
What did I do to deserve this pain
I'm crying out
I'm so alone without you here
What's this about?

[Verse 2]
I'm still amazed
Despite everything I still have love
What's keeping these feelings deep within  me
I thought they'd be easy to get rid of
There's no one I'm wanting more
You're the reason why I live, yeah
I'd give anything just to have you girl
Cuz you make me whole, you are my world

[Chorus 1x 2]
What did I do to deserve this pain
I'm crying out
I'm so alone without you here
What's this about?

[Bridge 1x 2]
Can't believe you're gone
Are you coming back?
Tell me what I've done
But I love you so...

What did I do to deserve this pain, I'm crying out...

[Timbaland (Talking):]
- Hello baby...why you got my man crying out?...
- What did you say?...
- That's not a nice thing to do
- See, he loves you
- But you know what, I love you too...
- So don't hurt him baby

[Ginuwine (Whispering):]
What's this about?

[Chorus till fade]
