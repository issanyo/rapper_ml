[Verse 1]
I can practice restraint if that's what you want
Let me zip up my boots, we can go for a walk
If I rein you in, you can follow my lead
We can ride so fast, just remember to breathe
If you start to gear up, then I'll tighten my grip
If you try to talk back, I'll be using my whip
Might be hard to hear you with my bit in your mouth
If it starts to hurt then you'll have to scream loud

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no use going back 'cause the damage is done
Throw away all the rules because it's gonna be now
Come on and let yourself go, 'cause there's no time to think
Now I'm in control of your animal instinct

[Chorus]
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal
If you want, I'll feed you like an animal
If you want, I'll hunt you like an animal
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal

[Verse 2]
If you misbehave, I can make you submit
If you start to act up, I can force you to quit
If you want me to break you, I can bring you the heel
Won't be hard to tame you when it's me that you fear

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no use going back 'cause the damage is done
Throw away all the rules because it's gonna be now
Come on and let yourself go, 'cause there's no time to think
Now I'm in control of your animal instinct
There's no use going back 'cause the damage is done
Throw away all the rules because it's gonna be now
Come on and let yourself go, 'cause there's no time to think
Now I'm in control of your animal instinct

[Chorus]
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal
If you want, I'll feed you like an animal
If you want, I'll hunt you like an animal
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal
If you want, I'll feed you like an animal
If you want, I'll hunt you like an animal
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal
