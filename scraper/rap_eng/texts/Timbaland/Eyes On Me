Keep your focus
Keep your focus
Keep your focus
Keep your focus

[Verse 1]
Better write this down
Better take some notes
Better sharpen your pencil boy
Now I'm going to show you how
(How you should go
You should know
I'm runnin' the show
In control
Once again your rockin the boat)
Now we can make this fun
Do the one on one
Have us a really good time
Whatever's on your mind
(Boy you can check out the show
You think I don't know
About to get you in trouble)

[Pre-Hook]
You make me feel like I'm not good enough tonight
You got the green light boy
You better get your mind right
Or I might have to hurt somebody
Have to hurt somebody
You better keep your eyes on me

[Hook]
Ooh & I just can't keep my eyes off you
Because every single time I do
Your lookin' ah ah keep lookin'
Can't you see
She ain't got nothin' on me
And you got me askin' why
Is there somethin' over there you like
You can stick with the other side
You watchin' yeah boy
You watchin' well watch this
I'ma show you what you missed
If you can keep your eyes on me

[Verse 2]
Now I was cool at first
When I was on your turf
I was the perfect girlfriend
You had me so open
I thought that I was the one the only one you want
If that's true then why do you keep lookin' cross the room

[Hook]
Ooh & I just can't keep my eyes off you
Because every single time I do
Your lookin' ah ah keep lookin'
Can't you see
She ain't got nothin' on me
And you got me askin' why
Is there somethin' over there you like
You can stick with the other side
You watchin' yeah boy
You watchin' well watch this
I'ma show you what you missed
If you can keep your eyes on me
