[Intro: DeVante Swing]
Yeahhh
Here I am sittin' in this fly ass hotel over Miami
Just watching the birds fly over the ocean
I guess I'm kinda trippin' 'cause I'm kinda high
And don't give a fuck
So I wanna come to you on the real, baby
And let you know how I feel
You know, for the last few days I've been watching you
All by my lonely, with your little friends
I see how you make them laugh
I've been kinda envious of your friends
'Cause it's like, they're so close to you
And i can't find the right things to say to get close to you
This is the only time in my life that money doesn't matter
The only thing that matters is finding the perfect place for me and you
So if you have the time, I got the place...

[Verse 1: K-Ci]
One, two, three seconds are gone
Coulda been gone, a long time ago
So baby don't be shy
Tell your girlfriend "bye-bye" so we can roll
And we can get nasty on the way
My car's got tint, so they won't see your face
There's no need to rein
Oh, what I wanna do to you is right, babe

[Chorus]
You've got the time, I've got the place
For everything, where me and you can hang
You've got the time, I've got the place
For everything, so baby don't be ashamed
You've got the time, I've got the place
For everything, where me and you can hang
You've got the time, I've got the place
For everything, so baby don't be ashamed

[Verse 2: K-Ci]
So baby check me out
I got a little place where we could hang out
No one will come around
So tell me if you're down
And have no doubt about us
I know you've got the time
'Cause lately I've been seeing you with nothing on your mind
So put your thought to use
And think about me and you just getting loose

[Pre-Chorus: JoJo]
You're gonna love me all night long
So let's get it on
Let's get it on, all night long, to the early morning

[Chorus]
You've got the time, I've got the place
For everything, where me and you can hang
You've got the time, I've got the place
For everything, so baby don't be ashamed
You've got the time, I've got the place
For everything, where me and you can hang
You've got the time, I've got the place
For everything, so baby don't be ashamed

[Rap: DeVante Swing]
One two, girl, one two, girl, get in the car
And we can go very far
While I be pumpin' up the good time
Rockin' the boomin' since I been chillin' with LL
Making your mouth swell, earrings jingling like the bells
So can you tell what's poppin'?
There ain't no stoppin 'cause baby I'm droppin'
Those cavvy lines to get you in the back of my ride
You got the tizzime, so baby won't you get on the side
Check it

[Pre-Chorus: JoJo]
You're gonna love me all night long
So let's get it on
Let's get it on, all night long, to the early morning

[Chorus: Jodeci + (K-Ci)]
You've got the time, I've got the place
For everything, where me and you can hang
You've got the time, I've got the place
For everything, so baby don't be ashamed
(Come on, come on, come on, baby)
You've got the time, I've got the place...
(Me and you, me and you...) ...hang
...time, I've got the place
For everything... (Can you feel it?)
You've got the time, I've got the place
For everything, where me and you can hang
You've got the time, I've got the place
For everything, so baby don't be ashamed
