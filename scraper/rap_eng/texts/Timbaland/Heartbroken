[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, baby, I wanna satisfy you
Maybe I try too damn hard, to show you I love you
What made you go and run this game on me?
When I stayed by your side
What made you go and leave?

[Hook]
I'm tired of my heart being broken
I'm tired of these tears falling down my face
I'm tired of this love being taken for granted
Won't you go your way

[Verse 2]
You don't know how I feel, I'm for real
I used to be in love, but not no more
When will you learn that I got feelings too?
You'll never know until it happens to you

[Hook]
I'm tired of my heart being broken
I'm tired of these tears falling down my face
I'm tired of this love being taken for granted
Won't you go your way

[Bridge]
There's one thing I gotta ask of you
One thing, gotta ask of you (gotta ask of you)
If this is true (true)
Why you took your love away?
Why you took your love away from me?
One thing I gotta ask of you (gotta ask of you)
If this is true (true)
Why you took your love away? (Why)

[Hook] 4x
I'm tired of my heart being broken
I'm tired of these tears falling down my face (falling, falling)
I'm tired of this love being taken for granted
(Won't you go your way)
