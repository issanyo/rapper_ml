[Demi Lovato talking about "Together"]
So, this song "Together" is a song that I co-wrote, and when I first heard the song, I new it should be a duet, and we all agreed, and we decided that Jason Derulo should've come in and sing the song. So when he did, we were all so excited. He just happened to be in Miami. I think he was down there to his grandmother's birthday or something random for one night, and when we called him up and asked if he could do the song, he said, "Yes, you caught me right as I was, on like, one night in Miami visiting my grandma." So we were really fortunate. We were really lucky. Him in the studio, he was so professional, was really sweet an he's got an amazing voice. So I loved the song. It's like an anthem. It's kinda like "We Are the World" kinda song. It's... it's beautiful, and it's really about loving one another and bringing everyone together. I think it's got a really positive message.
