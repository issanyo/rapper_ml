[Timb]
It's a hot Saturday
My little sister's outside
Playin' patty cake (patty cake)
My momma's in the kitchen (kitchen)
Wit' the Shake 'n Bake
Magoo got on the stockin' cap
Tryin' to pick this way
I'm (I'm) in the back with the play sta'
A little boy (boy) came and gave me an invitation
Said there's a party and ya gotta wear your suit
And ain't no time (time) for the D-Q
I say who-dee-who

[Static]
Pass me the courvoisier
It's a party-yea, it's time to play
I see today is a good day
I'm out for gleem, plus play it then finally hit your screen
I may not be the giant but I want that jolly green
I got tomorrow's dreams baby, don't share the turf (what?)
Maybe I'll tap your glass, I got some cheers for you
For they yak can't hold me back
So baby, whassup with that? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tell me where the party at

[Timb]
Pick it pick it pick it up

[Yoshamine]
You and I goin' do that damn thing, make it bang
You went out to the room in the back
Bring me in a Henney and a pack
Give a blunt to that fact suicide
State of mind, do or die, anytime
We can bang in the back of the 'Lac
Any damn thing bang
Do the thing in the back of the 'Lac
In the car, at the bar, gettin' high, wanna try
You went out with the heels on the block
Get the nine's all coughin'
And nigga's gon' run in our spot
Wonder why hypnotize, on my eyes and thighs
You ain't heard of me yet
But I betcha ain't met another one yet
Who do it like this

It's on, put yo hands in the air
We got you in the zone, get yo hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
We got you in the zone, put your hands in the air

If it's on, put your hands in the air
We got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
We got you in the zone, put your hands in the air

See I'm keepin' all the party people in the place
And I'll pull another playa's parts bags
Send searchin' for sex for six packs
See I'm Simpsoning them all to the back
She even knows I'm hellerin
So they'll move till they pickin low, go over really
If I say hit his head and then hang another round
I'm showing 'em, knowing if it's a drag
That you hit it from the back and stroke
Left to the right keep it right on time
One time, two time for your mind
Better get soft layers and go over mine
Come about two chairs and go here's an ear if it's on tonight
Then this is the word I speak
Shit don't quicks mo' too tight

[Static]
I come clear to your mouth and spit many a spouse and get
Civil cuz riddles can sizzle picks it a foul out
Package your rap attack, it's for presses and stash
They catch your track by the tail and smack they head on the nail
Factoring the jam made by Timbaland givin' fans something
Bumpin' (bumpin') and scrumpin' for your consumption
Listen close to the slick and those quick quotes
Keep gettin' dope shit, fuck with this, it'll get you so most

[Yoshamine]
When she get crucial forget about what chu used to
Cuz I'm here to pay dues too, nigga put it to the back sayin'
I'mma school you on the rules to how to tell who's who
On a cruise to who's tryin' to use you
In the same sentence demention that will lose your attention
So pull mad intentions like Mag'
Lot of people gonna wanna see me stand stagnant, but it ain't gonna happen
Sound completely like Twista, or get mean like Mista'
For they feel the purple from the first time
The first rhyme that they first heard
First word, nigga's know that I'm a gold mine
Come on nigga's now lets go a time
Tell I'm in a power mood, the party groove records tour if I move it
I'mma support their dues or loose it

It's on, put yo hands in the air
If I got you in the zone, get yo hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air

If it's on, put your hands in the air
If I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
If got you in the zone, put your hands in the air

If it's on, put your hands in the air
I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
If I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air

If it's on, put your hands in the air
If got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
If I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air

Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on

If it's on, put your hands in the air
We got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
We got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
