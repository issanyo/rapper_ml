I ain't got no money
I ain't got no car to take you on a date
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we can be the perfect soulmates
Talk to me girl
Oh, baby it's alright now you ain't gotta flaunt for me
Even if we go dutch you can still touch my love it's free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out until we get it right
- Keri Hilson & (Timbaland)
Baby if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
(I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped
Can you handle me the way I'm are?)
I don't need the G's or the car keys
Boy I like you just the way you are
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like that like that

It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best
Talk to me girl
Oh, baby it's alright now you ain't gotta flaunt for me
Even if we go dutch you can still touch my love it's free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out until we get it right
