(Intro: Timbaland & Aaliyah)
Baby girl, I'm the man from the big VA
Won't you come play round my way
And listen to what I gotta say
Timbaland, don't you know I am the man
Rock shows here to Japan
Have people shaking-shaking my hand
Baby girl, better known as Aaliyah
Give me goosebumps and high fevers
Make the playa haters believe us
Don't you know
Gotta tell somebody, 'cause
'Cause I really need somebody
Tell me you're that somebody

(Verse 1: King Gemini)
That girl she all mine
That girl she mighty fine
That girl she got me drooling
Losing track of time
Baby looking like a snack
I'm just tryna go and run some game like a quarterback
Get down with a zodiac
How you gone walk up in here like you the baddest one?
Moving your hips when you walk look like you tryna shake some
Looking like a Diamond with that bootylicious bubblegum
You already know that I'm a go and get that honey bun
What's your name?
Where you from?
What's your number? Does it start with 901?
I just wanna talk to you
Stay all night and rock with you
Hop up in a foreign car and cruise around the block with you

(Hook: Aaliyah)
If I, if I let you know
You can't tell nobody
I'm talkin' 'bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy I gotta watch my back
'Cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go? Is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no
'Cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody?

(Verse 2: Aaliyah)
Boy, I've been watching you like the hawk in the sky that fly and you were my prey (my prey)
Boy, I promise you if we keep bumpin' heads I know that one of these days (days)
We gon' hook it up while we talk on the phone
But see, I don't know if that's good
I've been holdin' back this secret from you
I probably shouldn't tell it, but
If you tell the world (don't speak, you know that would be weak)
Oh boy, see I'm trusting you with my heart, my soul
I probably shouldn't let you but

(Hook: Aaliyah)
If I, if I let you know
You can't tell nobody
I'm talkin' 'bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy I gotta watch my back
'Cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go? Is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no
'Cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody?
