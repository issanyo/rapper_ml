[Verse 1:]
I be with them bitches who run the scene
I be with them niggas that play on them teams
We be them bitches that’s livin’ yo dream
I be the illest bitch you ever seen
My bags all heavy ‘cause I got all this cash
But all this cash brought all them bags
Them boys all froze ‘cause of all this ass
You can’t just grab, boy you got to ask
Trinidad, yeah I keep a few niggas
They did it but, I’ma do it bigger (bigger, bigger)
I’ma G.O.A.L digger
Rockstar life and I’m just so iller
Got the fire, stop, drop and go
Black leather jacket, Rock & Roll

[Hook]
La, la, la, la, la, la-la, la, la-la (x8)

[Verse 2:]
Pass the la, la, la, la, la, la-la, la, la-la
Laughin’ at you like, ha ha ha ha-ha
What they talkin’ ‘bout?, blazé, blah, blah-blah
They roll up, but they not as high as I
Salute
You in a real bitch presence
Nigga, don’t come through without no presents
Better bow down when you see them legends
Let a bitch speak when you see her step in
My bitches is ‘bout that life
Bought the money, when I rock that ice
Rather make a dollar than chase that pipe
Real bitches say “Yeah”, if know I’m fuckin’ right
‘Bout that money, throw it in the air
If you really got it
You won’t even care
The genius, without a penis
Turnt out she was the meanest
Na, na, na, na, never seen it
Rockstar, ripped jeans shit, supreme shit
Supremacy!
Queen bitch, no symmetry
I’m the one, no copies, no sloppies
Fly like a butterfly, Ali
Come on Tim lets lock and load
Pop that pill and roll
If you really ‘bout that Rock & Roll

[Hook]
La, la, la, la, la, la-la, la, la-la (x8)
