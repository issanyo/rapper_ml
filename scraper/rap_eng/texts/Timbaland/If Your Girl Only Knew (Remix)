If your girl only knew (knew)
That you was tryin' to get with me
(what would she do?)
If your girl only knew (knew)
That you was dissin' her, to talk to me

She would probably leave (leave)
You alone (you alone)
She'd probably curse you out and
Unplug her phone (oh)
I bet she'd be glad, (oh, yeah)
That you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry
Oh, check

If your girl only knew, knew
That I would want, to kick it with you
(if she knew)
And if your girl could only see (see)
How you be callin' me, gettin' fresh with me

She would probably leave (leave)
You alone (you alone)
She'd probably curse you out and
Unplug her phone (oh)
I bet she'd be glad, (oh, yeah)
That you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry

She is crazy to put up with you (hey)
But, boy, I won't be no fool
(won't be no fool)
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me (no, baby)
It's dumb to put up with you
I won't be no fool (won't be no fool)
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me

She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out
And unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad (she'll be glad)
That you was gone (that you was goneee)
And then she wouldn't have to worry

She would probably leave you alone
(leaveeee you alone, ohh,)
She would probably curse you out
And unplug her phone (ooohhhh)
I bet she'd be glad (babe, oh yeah)
That you was gone (that you was goneeeee)
And then she wouldn't have to worry

She would probably leave you (if your girl only knew)
Alone
She would probably curse you out
And unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad (if your girl only knew)
That you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry
