[Verse 1]
Give me a sour power
I'ma need a sponge roller and some sweet pajamas
Give me some Donnie Simpson
On Video Soul where I got my first attention
Cause I don't wanna sound familiar
Want a guaranteed single, not an album filler
Give me some 90's music
I want Timbaland on it, I know he can do it

[Chorus]
All my people they hear this and be askin', What?
Brandy on the radio, turn it up
Timbaland, you know how to bang the club
Give my people something to shake their butts
All my people they hear this and be askin', What?
Brandy on the radio, turn it up
Timbaland, you know how to bang the club
Give my people something to shake their butts

[Verse 2]
Like something big
A Kid 'n Play reunion, give me House Party
Give me House of Music, yup, gimme 92 and
Lemme do my thing on it so they won't refuse it
Get Baby Girl's attention
She's more than a woman and we sure do miss her
I wanna represent her
Timbaland, Missy, you get the picture

[Refrain](4x)
Give it up, we gon' show you how we party

[Chorus]
All my people they hear this and be askin', What?
Brandy on the radio, turn it up
Timbaland, you know how to bang the clubs
Give my people something to shake their butts
All my people they hear this and be askin', What?
Brandy on the radio, turn it up
Timbaland, you know how to bang the clubs
Give my people something to shake their butts

[Bridge]
Bang this joint for all the clubs
All my people, all my folks
Hit the streets and tell your friends
Your girl Brandy is back again
Is everybody ready? Here I come
Is everybody ready? It's been long enough
Is everybody ready? I'm overdue
Is everybody ready? I'm here for you

[Chorus]
All my people they hear this and be askin', What?
Brandy on the radio, turn it up
Timbaland, you know how to bang the clubs
Give my people something to shake their butts
All my people they hear this and be askin', What?
Brandy on the radio, turn it up
Timbaland, you know how to bang the clubs
Give my people something to shake their butts

[Repeating first part of verse 1]
Give me a sour power
I'ma need a sponge roller and some sweet pajamas
Give me some Donnie Simpson
On video soul where I got my first attention
Give me a sour power
I'ma need a sponge roller and some sweet pajamas
Give me some Donnie Simpson
On video soul where I got my first attention

[Outro](repeat till end)
Give me some 90's music
I want Timbaland on it, I know he can do it
