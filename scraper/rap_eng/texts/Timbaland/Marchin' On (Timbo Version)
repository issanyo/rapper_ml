For those days we felt like a mistake
Those times when love's what you hate
Somehow
We keep marchin' on

For those nights that i couldn't be there
I've made it harder to know that you know
That somehow
We'll keep movin' on

There's so many wars we fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on

For all of the plans we made
There isn't a flag I'd wave
Don't care where we've been
I'd sink us to swim
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on

For those doubts that swirl all around us
For those lives that tear at the seams
We know
Were not what we've seen

Oh
For this dance we move with each other
There ain't no other step
Than one foot
Right in front of the other
Oh

There's so many wars we fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on

For all of the plans we made
There isn't a flag I'd wave
Don't care where we've been
I'd sink us to swim
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on

Right Right Right Right Left
Right Right Right Right Left
Right Right Right Marchin' On

We'll have the days we break
And we'll have the scars to prove it
We'll have the bomb that we saved
And we'll have the heart
Not to lose it

For all of the times we fought
For all of the things I'm not

Oh!
You put one foot in front of the other
We go where we go we're marchin' on
Marchin' on

There's so many wars we fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on
Right Right Right Right Left
Right Right Right Right Left
Marchin' on
Marchin' on
