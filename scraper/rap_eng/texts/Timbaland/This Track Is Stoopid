[Intro: Pusha T]
Timbo the king, right?
Haha
Uhn
EGGGHCK

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
King Push, Timbo
V.A, that’s kin folk
Cocaine on tempo
You hold hands with that nympho
My big pimpin', too cold
Lobster and shrimp, I’m the new Hov
No Carter here, but my Cartier
Is just lit up like a party here
I’m post Porter, A.Z
Midget moli and a AC
Triple park like Freddy Meyers
We gettin' money like it’s ‘83
Modern day hide away
South to France on holiday
She in Hermes with her ass up
And I’m smackin’ it like Oda Mae
I turned her, I showed her
I made her cause I mold her
I owed her not a iota
I dressed her up cause she on my shoulder
(Woo!) Baller like
You’ve been a petty nigga all your life
Take shoes back quick when she pause a fight
Shoot a bitch in her foot like it’s Harlem Nights

[Hook: Timbaland]
This track is stoopid
All the ones

SOON!
