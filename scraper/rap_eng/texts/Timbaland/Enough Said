[Intro: Aaliyah]
Cause I

[Verse 1: Aaliyah]
I can tell there's something wrong witchu
Tell me do you wanna talk about it, talk about it?
You say you got a lot on your mind
Sit down, let's talk about it, talk about it
I hate to see you feel this way
So tell me what can I do to make
It better for you, make it better for you, baby, hey

[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
Baby, tell me what I gotta do to get you to talk about it
Cause we've been together a little too long for you not to talk about it
So tell me what you would like me to do
To help you, help me, help you
Cause I don't really want to tell without you

[Verse 3: Drake]
Went from my nigga serving it by the tele to venues in Manchester
Just swerving with Balotelli the fuck are you trying to tell me?
Bothers me when you got to play therapist
That shit's embarrassing
They even bring up these niggas make a comparison
They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150
Still ain't got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy
Running through the city with niggas I'd give a kidney
Selling under 150 you niggas got to be kidding
Is this even still a discussion?
Don't you ever wake up disgusted
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin
And people's feelings have changed ever since I became something
Girls that becoming ladies, and my friends are having babies
And babies are dropping dead in my city, this shit is crazy
And I don't know if speaking on it helps
This is shit that's on my mind I just keep it to myself
You know

[Bridge: Aaliyah]
Can't you talk to me?
Let's talk about it, talk about it
Tell me what you need
Just tell me baby, tell me baby
Sometimes you are, all alone
But there's no doubt
So don't just shut me out
Cause that's not what love's about

[Hook: Aaliyah]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge 2: Aaliyah]
Came too far to give up, gotta try
Cause I can't do it on my own
