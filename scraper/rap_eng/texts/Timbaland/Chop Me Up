[Intro: DJ Paul]
Yeah, yeah, hey
It's goin', goin', goin' down
Tennessee, Justin Timberlake (Boy)
Timbaland (Boy)
Three 6 M-M-Mafia
Tennessee
V.A. dirty south, dirty south
This how we do what we do, man
When we do what we do
What, what
Project shit, what?

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I know you see me lookin', girl, go on and act right
A little closer, let me see you in the spotlight
Now turn around and let me see just what you curve like
Go grab your friends and y'all can come to the back, ooh
Why don't you take a sip up on this champagne?
Relax, take your coat off, and let me get your name
I love that hourglass shape you got up on that frame
I like the way you talk your game, we might be one and the same
Now I know you got a buzz off that alcohol
I got a house that can entertain all o' y'all
Maybe later on, I'll give you a phone call
About to slide out, but I'll get back at ya, ooh
And when I call, don't give me the runaround
I ain't gon' have ya try to play me like a silly clown
Don't second guess it, girl, there ain't nothin' to think about
'Cause ya got me fiendin', but girl, ya don't hear me

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
Little lady (Lady, lady)
You got me just (Screwed up)
Off of your melody
Little lady (Lady, lady)
Come on and don't (Chop me up)
Please don't make a fool of me
Little lady (Lady, lady)
You got me just (Screwed up)
Off of your melody
Easy, baby (Baby, baby)
Come on, girl, don't (Chop me up)
Please don't make a fool of me

[Verse 2: Timbaland & Justin Timberlake]
You're kinda cute, baby, are you new in town?
My name is Tim, a.k.a. Thomas Crown
I heard you're lost, do you know your way around?
If you got a problem, baby, I can hold you now (Oh)
I can be your navigator or your compass
Better yet a genie, baby, make your first wish
You the party, baby, I'm just the guest list
I think I need some Tylenol, you got me restless
So grab your friends and let's take ya back to my house
Let's watch Sex and the City or Desperate Housewives
Simon says, touch yours while you touch mine
Parental discretion is advised (Oh)
Y'all can be the star in my freaky spot light
Studio 54 if we get the props right
All we need right now is a little bit of, little bit of act right
Y'all lookin shy, but y'all act like y'all don't hear me

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
Little lady (Lady, lady)
You got me just (Screwed up)
Off of your melody
Little lady (Lady, lady)
Come on and don't (Chop me up)
Please don't make a fool of me
Little lady (Lady, lady)
You got me just (Screwed up)
Off of your melody
Easy, baby (Baby, baby)
Come on, girl, don't (Chop me up)
Please don't make a fool of me

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
Yeah, see, girl, you stronger then the strongest drug I ever had
You can mix 'em all together, you still would be twice as bad
'Cause you're the worst best girlfriend I ever had
Harder to quit than cigarettes and green bags
Harder to escape than jail cells and bills
Man, ya you had me lost since the minute girl and pig tails
Like Michael Jackson, how you do me this way
Got me cryin' rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake, yeah

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
They call me Juicy J, straight up out the Three 6 Mafia
Ghetto fab player, all these freaks I'm tryna holler at ya
Quit playin' games, girl, you got my head spinnin' 'round
I ain't gon' chirp your mobile phone and chase you all over town
I just wanna pick you up and take you to a wrestling match
Is it good? Is it good? And have a lil' smack fest
So if you never call me, I'll be somewhere down in Tennessee
Washin' away my sorrows in cold cup o' Hennessy

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
Little lady (Lady, lady)
You got me just (Screwed up)
Off of your melody
Little lady (Lady, lady)
Come on and don't (Chop me up)
Please don't make a fool of me
Little lady (Lady, lady)
You got me just (Screwed up)
Off of your melody
Easy, baby (Baby, baby)
Come on, girl, don't (Chop me up)
Please don't make a fool of me

[Outro: Timbaland & Justin Timberlake]
Screwed up
Chop me up
Screwed up (Off of your melody)
Chop me up (Please don't make a fool of me)
