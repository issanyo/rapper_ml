[Intro: Timbaland]

Uh, hahaha! Can you feel me? Uh!
Say what, say what, uh!                          (Uh! Uh!)
Uh, hahaha! Can you feel me?
Usher, uh!                                       (Uh! What?)

[Chorus: Usher]

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you,               (Oh yeah... Baby!)
This is what you do!                             (Oooh, baby!)
Think about her and all the things
That come along with
You make me...                                   (You make me...)
You make me...                                   (... make me...)

This is what you do!                             (... baby!)
Think about her and all the things
That come along with
You make me...
You make me...

[Verse 1: Usher]

Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend!
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems!         (That's right!)
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do!
And when I go home at night
And lay my head down
All I seem to think about was you
And how...

[Chorus: Usher]

... you make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you,               (Ooh, yeah! Ooh, yeah!)
This is what you do!                             (Aah, yeah!)
Think about her and all the things
That come along with,                            (... come along with...)
You make me...                                   (You make me...)
You make me...                                   (You make me...)
Leave the one I'm with
Start a new realtionship with you,               (Ooh, baby!)
This is what you do!
Think about her and all the things               (Come on, come on, come
On,...)
That come along with,                            (... come on, come on!)
You make me...
You make me...

[Verse 2: Usher]

Now what's bad
Is you're the one that hooked us up!
Knowing it should've been you!
What's sad is that I love her
But I'm falling for you!
What should I do?
Should I...
... tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I...
... do exactly what I feel inside?
Cause I...
... I don't wanna go
Don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together!

[Chorus: Usher]

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with,        (UUH!)
Start a new relationship with you,               (Ooh Baby!)
This is what you do!                             (See what you do?)
Think about her and all the things               (Ah, yeah!!!)
That come along with
You make me...                                   (You make me...)
You make me...                                   (You make me...)

Start a new relationship with you,               (Ooh, baby!)
This is what you do!                             (This is what you do!)
Think about her and all the things               (Yeah!!!)
That come along with
You make me...                                   [Timbaland] Uh!
You make me...                                   [Timbaland] Uh!

But I never thought...
... that i would change my decision!             (Uh-uh!)
I wanna kiss you...
... and hold your hand with your permission!     (Uh-uh!)
Honey got me twisted in the head like a ???!
