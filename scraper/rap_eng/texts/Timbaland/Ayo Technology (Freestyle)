[INTRO: Memphis Bleek]
Something special
Rock-a-fella
In Miami
MOP
Brooklyn
Bedstuy
Let's ride

She want it, I gonna get it to her
She ready, I gotta get it to her
She know that, I'm gonna get it to her

[Verse 1: Memphis Bleek]
No Blackberry, no cell phone
No SMS, no nothing
Just sexing you no fronting
No text message no nothing yo
Technical, that's logical
I'm only down here for an hour or two
Whatchu tryna do, what side of you?
I'll show you that thing that a diver do
No MySpace, no Hotmail
No IM, no computer love
No Facebook, no BlackPlanet
Just me and you making do what it does
No picture mail, you strip for me
Come to the crib you pit for me
Put your hands and lips for me
Me and you girl'll make history
Tell me what you like got bottles on ice
Got a crib in the hills we can do it all night
In the middle of the woods what's hood what's good girl
Tell me what you want I do what I should girl
You know I'm ready when you ready we can get it popping
And once you come to the crib know we never stopping

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]

Baby this a new age, you like my new craze
Let's get together maybe we can start a new phase
The smokes got the club all hazy, spotlights don't do you justice baby
Why don't you come over here, you got me saying

Ayo, I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me
Ayo, I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me

Ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh (so), I got to give it to her
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh (so), I got to give it to her

[OUTRO: Timbaland]
Your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
