[Verse 1]
I keep seeing your face when my eyes are closed
I'm remembering how it used to go
All the medicated, nearly comatose
A bullet out of your head, is it on that road?

[Pre-Chorus]
So much in your mind when you kill more than time
You're sinking so low, thinking you will be high
Biting your lip while you're losing your mind
Alone god knows

[Chorus]
You're climbing up the walls, the walls, the walls
You're climbing up the walls, the walls, the walls
You're just climbing up the walls, the walls, the walls
You're climbing up the walls, the walls, the walls

[Verse 2]
Now you're reaching that age where you should know
How to figure it out out all on your own
On the far side of town is a room you love
Started tearing it down to get you to follow

[Pre-Chorus]
So much in your mind when you kill more than time
You're sinking so low, thinking you will be high
Biting your lip while you're losing your mind
Alone god knows

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3]
The world won't rise and ease your crying
If you do nothing, if you do nothing
The world won't try to change your mind
If you don't change at all
The world won't rise and ease your crying
If you do nothing, if you do nothing
The world won't try to change your mind
If you don't change at all

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Drunk, he's fast asleep
He's so tired, makes me weep
He stays up all night working on his songs
But then i guess we all do the same thing
He still asleep?
