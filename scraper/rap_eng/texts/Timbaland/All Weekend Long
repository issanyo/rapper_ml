[Intro: Jack G + Timbaland]
We are the future
Jack
Yeah
Come on

[Verse 1: Jack G]
Have you ever watched the sunrise
Ros√© in your hand
Toes up in the sand, yeah, yeah
Have you ever stayed up all night?
Rollin' round the hills
Can't believe it's real, oh
I think we should get along ('course you do)
Maybe we could kick it girl
Maybe that could be a thing
I think we should get along
Maybe we could get together

[Chorus: Jack G]
All weekend long
All weekend long
We getting gone all weekend long
All weekend long
We goin' strong all weekend long
Do what we want
All weekend long
Do what we want
All weekend long
Til the next one comes
Til the next one comes
Til the next one comes
Til the next one comes
Til the next one

[Verse 2: Jack J]
All weekend long, we be up, we be on
We be poppin' these bottles, we off that strong
Live for tonight 'cause what if it don't come? yeah
What if tomorrow don't come
And what if sun doesn't rise in the morning
And that's my excuse why I sip this patron
Just wanna get loose and get lifted and gone
I might just go 'til my vision is gone, gone, gone
And when you come around
The women the liquor it's all top shelf
We did it independent all by ourselves
And we ain't gonna stop 'til the time's out, nah (nah nah)
What's goin' down
This weekend let's find out, let's find out
What's goin' down (what)
This weekend let's find out

[Chorus: Jack G]
All weekend long
All weekend long
We getting gone
All weekend long
All weekend long
We goin' strong
All weekend long
Do what we want
All weekend long
Do what we want
All weekend long
Til the next one comes
Til the next one comes
Til the next one comes
Til the next one comes
Til the next one comes
Til the next one comes
Til the next one comes
Til the next one comes
Til the next one comes

[Bridge: Jack & Jack]
I ain't gotta worry, it's the weekend
I'mma turn up; I don't need a reason
I ain't gotta worry, it's the weekend
I'mma turn up; I don't need a reason
I ain't gotta worry it's the weekend
Imma turn up I don't need a reason
I ain't gotta worry, it's the weekend
I'mma turn, turn up

[Chorus: Jack G]
All weekend long
All weekend long
We getting gone
All weekend long
All weekend long
We goin' strong
All weekend long
Do what we want
All weekend long
Do what we want
All weekend long
Til the next one comes
Til the next one comes
Til the next one comes
Til the next one comes
Til the next one comes
Til the next one comes
Til the next one comes
Til the next one comes
