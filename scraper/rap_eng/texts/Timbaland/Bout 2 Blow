[Intro]
Blow, blow, blow, I'm bout to blow, I'm bout to blow
I'm bout to blow, I'm bout to blow, I'm bout to blow
I'm bout to blow, I'm bout to blow, I'm bout to blow

[Verse 1: Yazz]
Had my eyes on the throne since I came to this earth
Greatness, I'm destined for more than the universe
I'm a king, boss, rule everything  I survey, know my worth
Put in work, work, work (24/7)
I run the turf like a running back
Hand me the ball and I ran it back
Score every time like I'm intercept
I run the team, call me quarterback
I ain't come from the bottom but still had to grind for it
Pop plotted on me but momma, she ride for me
Tell 'em Tim

[Hook: Timbaland]
We winning got money so long it a take
A life time for us to try to spend it
Grind like Lebron put up numbers
We balling we the ones contending
Pull up in foreigns It look like a alien could hop up in it
Ain't nobody out here that's flyer
So we bout to blow, we bout to blow, blow, blow, blow
Say we bout to blow, we bout to blow, we bout to blow
We bout to blow, we bout to blow, blow, blow, blow
We bout to blow, say we bout to blow, blow, blow, blow

[Verse 2: Yazz]
Tell them I'm comin' ain't nobody stoppin' me
I want it all and that's just how it got to be
Handle my business, I do it so properly
Nobody copy me, my monopoly
Building my dynasty, here for the fortune, takin' no losses
Whatever it takes I get through it no caution
'Till I'm in the coffin
Ride with no brakes, I won't stop or fall off this
Might turn out on it
Ride through the night, I'mma shine in the mornin'
Cause I want the Forbes list
Timbo, Timbo, kill 'em

[Hook: Timbaland]
We winning got money so long it a take
A life time for us to try to spend it
Grind like Lebron put up numbers
We balling we the ones contending
Pull up in foreigns It look like a alien could hop up in it
Ain't nobody out here that's flyer
So we bout to blow, we bout to blow, blow, blow, blow
Say we bout to blow, we bout to blow, we bout to blow
We bout to blow, we bout to blow, blow, blow, blow
We bout to blow, say you bout to blow, blow, blow, blow
Blow blow blow blow blow blow blow blow blow blow
