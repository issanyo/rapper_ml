[Timbaland:]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Y'all remember this one
A Timbaland classic

Oh, oh
C'mon, Kiley

[Verse 1:]
I barely know his name
I know he seems real cool
He ain't about no games
I think I like this dude

But I'ma play it low
And hope he doesn't see
That I am gettin' kinda comfortable
I'm a let him know this time

[Chorus:]
I know you wanna cross the line
(I know)
I know you wanna cross the line
But I can't let ya
(Oh, no, no, no)

I know you wanna cross the line
I know you wanna cross the line
But I just met ya
(No, no)

You make me wanna cross the line
(You make me)
You make me wanna cross the line
(Wanna cross the line)

It's official
But I ain't gonna cross the line
(No, no, no)
I ain't gonna cross the line
Now even with ya

[Verse 2:]
He's pretty sweet on me
He even told me so
And when he touches me

I wanna tell him no
But then he's in my ear
Whispering things to me
Gotta say stop right here
'Cause I can't take the heat

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
You different from the other guys
(Oh)
I ain't even gonna try and lie
(I ain't gonna lie)

It's true we got a crazy vibe
And ya givin' me the bedroom eyes
(Yeah, yeah)
No, I don't wanna compromise
'Cause I know it really won't be right
(Oh, it won't be right, no, no)

[Repeat Chorus:]

No
I ain't gonna cross the line
No

Hey
No
Oh, yeah
