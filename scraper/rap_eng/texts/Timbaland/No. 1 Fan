Chorus:
I'm lookin' for my #1 fan
I know she's somewhere in the stands
Let me see you wavin your hands
I can't see you
Wave a little more if you can, Where's my #1
I'm lookin' for my #1 fan
I know she's somehere in the stands
And we'll be doin' more than shakin' hands
I can't see you
Wave a little more if you can, where's my #1

1st Verse:
I've seen every picture you sent
I've read every letter you wrote
And everytime they play my song
You sang it (note by note)
I wonder what you do to me
If you were to see me in the streets
Well darlin' I would like to see
Be at my show waitin' for me

Chorus

2nd Verse:
I hear you everytime you scream
I put it on you in your dreams
I'm hangin' on your bedroom wall
I see you when you ain't wearin' nothin' at all
And sometimes you look at me
When you be feelin, oh freaky
Well darlin' I would like to see
Be at my show waitin' for me

Chorus

I can't see you
(Where they at, there they go over there over here)
(Repeat 4x)

Chorus
