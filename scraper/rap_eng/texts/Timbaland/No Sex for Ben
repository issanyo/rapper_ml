[Intro]
One, two, three, here we go
One, two, three, here we go

[Verse 1]
Ben Rymer, trash people
No sex, no sex for Ben Rymer now
Ben Rymer, trash people
No sex, no sex for Ben Rymer
Ben Rymer, he's trashed people
No sex, no sex for Ben Rymer now
Ben Rymer, trash people
No sex, no sex for Ben, no

[Chorus]
No-oh, no-oh
No sex for Ben
No-oh, no-oh

[Verse 2]
Ben Rymer, trash people
No sex, no sex for Ben Rymer now
One ladder, big liar
No sex, no sex for Ben Rymer
Fat trucker, cheap sucker
No sex, no sex for Ben Rymer now
Cheap faker, cheap, cheap faker
Lookin' like a poor man's Arthur Baker now

[Chorus]
No-oh, no-oh
No sex for Ben
No-oh, no-oh
No sex for Ben
No-ho
No sex for Ben
No-ho
No sex for Ben
No-ho
No-ho-ho-ho

[Verse 3]
Cheap faker, cheap, cheap faker
Lookin' like a poor man's Arthur Baker now
Ben Rymer, big-time lover
Try to snatch the kitty off his girlfriend's mother
We gotta freeze them up now
We gotta freeze them up, oh, come on, let's go
We gotta freeze them up
I said a one, two, three, freeze

[Chorus]
No-oh, no-oh
No sex for Ben
No-oh, no-oh
No sex for Ben
No-ho
No sex for Ben
No-ho
No sex for Ben
No-ho
No-ho-ho-ho
