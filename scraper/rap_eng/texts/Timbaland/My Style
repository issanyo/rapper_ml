[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
I know that you like my style, I know that you like my style
We came here to turn you out
Everybody in the place get wild
I know that you like my style, I know that you like my style
We bout to drop it on your ass right now
Everybody in the place get wild (so what you saying?!)

[Post-Chorus]
Wassup, wassup whichu girl?!
Wassup, wassup whichu girl?!
Wassup, wassup whichu boy?!
Wassup, wassup whichu boy?!

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Don't jock, don't jock baby, don't jock me
I drop the hotness, baby watch me
You can't, you can't, no you can't stop me
Cause I'm a champ on the rap like Rocky
And when I spit it, tri not a Z rocks me
Cause my styles trademark with the copy - right?
You know my style is naughty - right? So don't cock-block me!
You like my style when I'm wiling out with my gang
And I gain my fame from doing my damn thing - on the mic
Then I burn the stage like propane
And I bang them thangs, I'm a lover mayne

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
I know that you like my style, I know that you like my style
We came here to turn you out
Everybody in the place get wild
I know that you like my style, I know that you like my style
We bout to drop it on your ass right now
Everybody in the place get wild (so what you saying?!)

[Post-Chorus]
Wassup, wassup whichu girl?!
Wassup, wassup whichu girl?!
Wassup, wassup whichu boy?!
Wassup, wassup whichu boy?!

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
Our style lined up when we team up
JT and BEP sold the scene up
Cali to Tennessee and in between em
We the hottest in the biz, turn the beat up!
We be rolling four Hummers and a Beemer
When sun set, up the cheap cantina
Stepped out looking fresh and clean-ah
Paparazzi put me in they magazine-ah
I got eight million ways to rock ya like this
And ain't nobody drop their styles like this
I'm a give it to you like that and like this
And my momma always told me "My baby's a genius"

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
I know that you like my style, I know that you like my style
We came here to turn you out
Everybody in the place get wild
I know that you like my style, I know that you like my style
We bout to drop it on your ass right now
Everybody in the place get wild (so what you saying?!)

[Post-Chorus]
Wassup, wassup whichu girl?!
Wassup, wassup whichu girl?!
Wassup, wassup whichu boy?!
Wassup, wassup whichu boy?!

[Verse 3: Taboo]
Te gusta me estilo, dile a tu tia y tu tio
Aye viene Jimmy wit the lingo (lingo) I like to keep my style on single (single)
Baby you can call me mijo (mijo) I make you say "Aye Dios mio!" (mio)
Tu chocha es todo mio (ayee) I make it hot for you if it's frío (frío)

[Breakdown: will.i.am]
It feels like something's heating up
Timbaland's on the drum-drum, he's beating up
Black Eyed Peas, there's no defeating us
JT, he's rocking the beat with us
Them freaks, they want to freak with us
After the spot they tryna to meet with us
They know our style is fabulous
We off the hook, our styles ridiculous

[Post-Chorus]
Wassup, wassup whichu girl?!
Wassup, wassup whichu girl?!
Wassup, wassup whichu boy?!
Wassup, wassup whichu boy?!

[Outro: Timbaland Justin Timberlake]
Let me tell ya!
I know that you like my style, I know that you like my style
I've been gone for a while, but I'm back with a brand new style.. HEY!!
