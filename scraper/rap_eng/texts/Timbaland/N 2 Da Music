[Intro - Timbaland - talking] (*echo*)
Uh, ah, haha uh, ah
C'mon, (*harmonizing*)
What we got right here
Is that feel good music y'all
Uh, (*harmonizing*), c'mon

[Break - Brandy] - w/ ad libs
When I'm chillin in my neighbor's shade
Watchin the ocean from a balcony
And I love the sound of the waves
And I love it like that, cause to me this is how I get away

[Timbaland]
Ha, so what you gonna do girl, what you gonna do

[Hook - Brandy] - w/ ad libs
Outside with my TV on, cell phone on, the radio on
Cause I wanna get into the music
(Timbaland: I get into the music) (ho)

Outside with my TV on, cell phone on, the radio on
Cause I wanna get into the music
(Timbaland: I get into the music) (c'mon)

And it feel so good
It's like blood flowin to my veins
(Timbaland: It's like blood flowin to my veins)

And it feel so good
It's like blood flowing to my veins

[Timbaland]
Alright now, let's take it to the bridge (*echo*)

[Verse 1 - Timbaland]
(Ho) It's Timbaland I'm back (uh huh ...)
With another one you can dance, so you can relax (woo, woo ...)
My music moves you wherever you at
I play it loud, to move the crowd, I like it like that (c'mon, c'mon ...)
I know you feel the vibe, from the club to your clothes
And you'll still decide I love it
Everytime I get 'em a ride
I drop the top, turn the volume up and put it in drive
Me and Aaliyah did +One In A Million+
When Ginuwine dropped +Pony+ was the one that I'm feelin
Hey, we havin a party, come through with your crew
Turn up the feel good, do what you do

[Hook] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 2 - Magoo]
Yeah, when I'm feelin lost and hurt, you can soothe my soul
You was there for me, music
I was goin out of control, 'til I heard Marvin Gaye
"Now it ain't a mountain high enough, when time is rough"
I turn to you, yeah
Believe it or not, I learned from you, yeah
All of my soul, I bear to you
Your not a painkiller, but I think a snare'll do the trick
And I just wanna lose myself in you
I gained all my health and my wealth from you
I started thinkin me and you was just a phase
Now I can't count the days
