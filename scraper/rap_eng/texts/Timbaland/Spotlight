[Intro:]
I’ve been off-side i left my head on the dig
I feel i want that i need attention from you
I’ve been off-side i left my head on the dig
I feel i want that i need attention from you

[Verse 1:]
Cause i know that i feel afraid of the dark far too long
And I’m going to take control cause I’m afraid of the dark
I need attention i need i need attention

[Chorus:]
But the spot la la la light on me  [x3]
I need i need attention
I need i need attention from you
But the spot la la la light on me [x3]
I need i need attention
I need i need attention from you

[Verse 2:]
Not that I’m spoiled It’s guest i know I’m with boy
You should be happy i choose you to be the one
Cause i know that i feel afraid of the dark far too long
And I’m going to take control cause I’m afraid of the dark
I need attention i need i need attention

[Chorus:]
But the spot la la la light on me [x3]
I need i need attention
I need i need attention from you
But the spot la la la light on me [x3]
I need i need attention
I need i need attention from you
I need i need attention [x3]
I need i need attention from you
I need i need attention
I need i need attention from you
I need i need attention
I need i need attention from you
I want all your attention baby [x4]
But the spot la la la light on me [x3]
I need i need attention
I need i need attention from you
But the spot la la la light on me [x3]
I need i need attention
I need i need attention from you
But the spot la la la light on me [x3]
I need i need attention
I need i need attention from you
