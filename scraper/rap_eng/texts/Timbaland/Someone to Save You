[Verse 1]
Patience
It took you for everything
It looked like a diamond ring
And you wore it so much longer yhat made sense
Apathy, in disguise, crept on you like a spy
Hurt you in ways you can't describe

[Pre-Chorus]
Back to the start now
I won't let you go this way now

[Chorus]
Honesty is what you need
It sets you free
Like someone to save you
Let it go, but hurry though
There's undertow
And I don't wanna lose you now

[Verse 2]
Alright, sit down and spill your heart
Let's start from the very start
'Cause I can see by your eyes you're wasted
Your energy comes and goes
You've taken your time, and know
Nothing can change what's happened so

[Pre-Chorus]
Back to the start now
I won't let you go this way out

[Chorus]
Honesty is what you need
It sets you free
Like someone to save you
Let it go, but hurry though
There's undertow
And I don't wanna lose you, don't wanna lose you

[Bridge]
Now
Now
Oh my, look at how your bright star's faded
So how much can you take?

[Chorus]
Honesty is what you need
It sets you free
Like someone to save you
Let it go, but hurry though
There's undertow
And I don't wanna lose you

[Outro Until Fade]
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Someone to save you
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Someone to save you
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Someone to save you
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
