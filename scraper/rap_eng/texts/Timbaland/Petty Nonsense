[Verse 1]
Can’t no bitch with no bills on her list tell me how to run my agenda
Who are these dudes still yelling from their rooms staying home with their moms like a husband, oh
Little bag niggas don’t associate with ‘em
Wanna be a god but still on the true religion
Can’t come, nope
Put my hand up on the boat
You are not from the land I swim from
No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room
Please don’t insult my intelligence
My mindset is greater than your relevance
I, couldn't get a hold of your name there
Can't stay long 'cause the money's on hold and I gotta pick it up like daycare
You know I gotta pick it up I don't play fair

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta pick it up from the floor
Gonna make it hard for these hating ass niggas to ignore
Never give a nigga your location
Who's been giving niggas admiration?
I don't really know
Fraud ass niggas who be like that
Men runnin' up behind another man
Crowd full of bros I don't wanna get to know
I got blood [?]

[Chorus]
No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room
Nonsense, nonsense
No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room
Nonsense

[Verse 2]
If you're gonna run with the bulls better walk with [?] I gotta know what to with no lights out
Commas on the way, niggas wanna hang, all I'm gonna say when they try to lay the pipe down, is
Nope, your credit ain't shit
Four/five lots and my new whip still won't fit
Fuck are you to me?
Same hoes mad in the back ain't know who they wanna be
No time for the petty nonsense
Any bitch alive with a conscience knows
I'ma be around for a while now
Can't blame me if your nigga don't be giving you down time like he used to
Lately I been in [?] no bluetooth
I been in the cut getting C-notes
You be in the cut giving deep throat
Gotta pick it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta pick it up from the floor
Gonna make it hard for these hating ass niggas to ignore
Never give a nigga your location
Who's been giving niggas admiration?
I don't really know
Fraud ass niggas who be like that
Men runnin' up behind another man
Crowd full of bros I don't wanna get to know
I got blood [?]

[Chorus]
No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room
Nonsense, nonsense
No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room
Nonsense
