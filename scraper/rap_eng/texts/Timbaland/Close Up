Oohh ohh ah
Oohh ohh ah
[Verse]
We can capture the moment, we don't need a camera
Love the way that you keep it flashing like a cannon
Silent shooter, you got me when I least expected
Working angles, you gettin' me from all directions
Put you on that high definition love
Know I got that high definition touch
Shake that body like polaroids
I'm movin' all night, all night, alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be camera shy, baby zoom over
Let me get focused
There's a bigger picture, I just wanna show ya
Baby let me hold ya
Ready for my close up
Dying to be with ya

[Chorus]
Ready for my close up, close up, close up
Baby get closer, closer, closer
Ready for my close up, close up, close up
Baby get closer, closer, closer

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be camera shy, baby zoom over
Let me get focused
There's a bigger picture, I just wanna show ya
Baby let me hold ya
Ready for my close up
Dying to be with ya

[Chorus]
Ready for my close up, close up, close up
Baby get closer, closer, closer
Ready for my close up, close up, close up
Baby get closer, closer, closer
