[Verse 1: Timbaland]
Champagne kinda night
All the way turnt, ain't coming down
Everything coming right
Can't nothing hold us down
I got you all lit
Drunk, tripping off the sound
But you came here to get down

[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland]
I dig the vibe that you feeling
Girl and I'm feeling it
Forget tomorrow let's live in night
This could last forever
We can go where ever

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Oh it don't get no better
It don't get no better
Oh it don't get no better
It don't get no better

It don't get no better
It don't get no better
It don't get no better

[Verse 2: Mila J]
Champagne kinda night
All the way up, no turnin' down
Everything feelin' right
Me and my girls we hold it down
You got me all bent
Super faded off the ground
Ohh but I came to get down

[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland & Mila J]
I dig the vibe that you feeling
Boy and I'm feeling it
Forget tomorrow let's live in night
This could last forever
We can go where ever

[Chorus: Timbaland & Mila J]
Oh it don't get no better
It don't get no better
Oh it don't get no better
It don't get no better

[Outro]
Than this
Than this
It don't get no better
It don't get no better
It don't get no better
It don't get no better
It don't get no better
It don't get no better
It don't get no better
It don't get no better
