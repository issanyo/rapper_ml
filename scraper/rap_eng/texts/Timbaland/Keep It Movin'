[Intro: Serayah McNeill]
I'm so dangerous

[Verse 1: Serayah MnNeill
Listen to me, here we go
I got a body like a weapon
It goes ba, ba, bang, bang
And every time that we're together
I drive you insane, insane
Got me up in here, what you gonna do with it
Now I need a man that can aim lets get it
Get a little trigger happy [x2] (Hakeem)

[Verse 2: Yazz]
Every time I show her my maneuver
She brag about the way I give it to her
I do it sort of like a rooger
That's true tho, that's true tho, that's true tho
And I don't even got a license
And it don't matter because I get it private
Every time a I got it, she gon like it
She excited and I'm excited

[Hook: Serayah McNeill & Yazz]
And I don't got time for love
Don't got time for love (ain't got no time)
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin
And I don't got time for love
Don't got time for love (ain't got no time)
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin
Whoaaaaaa
Keep it movin', here we go
Keep it movin', here we go, go, ggo, go, go, ggo, go, go


[Verse 2: Serayah McNeill & Yazz]
I got a body like a weapon
It goes ba, ba, bang, bang
And every time that we're together
I make you say my name
Got me up in here, what you gon do with it
Now I need a man that can aim let's get it
Get a little trigger happy x2 (Hakeem)
I just wanna hit the bullseye once
You just wanna make me wait around for months
You can go first, I can go second
But I ain't sweatin for the record
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
One more time, bang, bang, bang, bang
I keep it up in and I hit you like a dog


[Hook]

Got a body like a weapon

It goes ba, ba, bang, bang

And every time that we're together

I make you say my name [x4]
