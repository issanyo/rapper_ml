[Intro]
Every woman, yeah

Gotta limit yeah
Sang with me girl

[Verse 1]
Ladies, have you ever had a man who push you when you low
You wanna stay out at night, and don’t care how you feel
Instead of manin’ up, oh I said ooo
I-I can’t concentrate, you so petty you
You stay touchin’ my last nerve, my friends say what’s wrong with you girl
I guess, what I’m really tryna to say is

[Hook]
Every woman has a breaking point ya’ll (breaking point)
Hey, I know you know, some women can be lied to
And cheated on, and beated on
Somebody know, hey
Every woman has a breaking point ya’ll (breaking point)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, tell me why we put up with that
You can’t forget that, see I done did that
But this time, there’s a limit to my love
(There’s a limit, there’s a limit...there’s a limit, there’s a limit)
There’s a limit to my love
(There’s a limit, there’s a limit...there’s a limit, there’s a limit)

[Verse 2]
Now baby, don’t push me cause I’m close to the edge
Today your baby momma called, said she boxin’ up yo sh!t (yo sh!t)
When you barely pleasin’ me, how you gon' take care of yo kids
Now I gotta contemplate, I hate to say it but I wanted your last name
My momma said what’s wrong with you girl

Now ladies, we really should be mad at ourselves
Cause see, some women just tolerate way too damn much
Now I know we gotta choose our battles
But damn it, every woman gotta breaking point
And see the next time he’s testin’ yo love
You put your finger in his face and you tell him
