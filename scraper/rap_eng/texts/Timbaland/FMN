[Verse 1]
I see that want to in your eyes, sweet baby
I'm starting to see what I could choose baby
We were designed to reproduce
Can we rehearse what we're made to do
You wanna dress for easy access baby

[Hook]
Fuck me now, fuck me good
Yeah that's right, baby it's all yours
Ain't no other way to put it, baby
Fuck me now, fuck me good
Yeah that's right, baby it's all yours
Doesn't matter where we do it, baby
Fuck me now, fuck me good
Yeah that's right, baby it's all yours
I'm gonna give you every inch of me, baby
Fuck me now, fuck me good
Yeah that's right, baby it's all yours
Yeah, ain't no stopping till the sunrise, baby
Fuck me now, fuck me good
Yeah that's right, baby it's all yours

[Verse 2]
This is talking and I'm listening baby
Mix that Sprite with your activism, baby
Girl you divine, a waterfall
The way you drip, wanna catch it all
What's the use in holding back now, baby?

[Hook]
Fuck me now, fuck me good
Yeah that's right, baby it's all yours
Ain't no other way to put it, baby
Fuck me now, fuck me good
Yeah that's right, baby it's all yours
Doesn't matter where we do it, baby
Fuck me now, fuck me good
Yeah that's right, baby it's all yours
I'm gonna give you every inch of me, baby
Fuck me now, fuck me good
Yeah that's right, baby it's all yours
Yeah, ain't no stopping till the sunrise, baby
Fuck me now, fuck me good
Yeah that's right, baby it's all yours

[Bridge]
Butterflies emerge from the carpool
Special wings for me baby make room
Feel the energy from the phone booth
Maximize our frequency to ringtone

[Hook]
Fuck me now, fuck me good
Yeah that's right, baby it's all yours
Ain't no other way to put it, baby
Fuck me now, fuck me good
Yeah that's right, baby it's all yours
Doesn't matter where we do it, baby
Fuck me now, fuck me good
Yeah that's right, baby it's all yours
I'm gonna give you every inch of me, baby
Fuck me now, fuck me good
Yeah that's right, baby it's all yours
Yeah, ain't no stopping till the sunrise, baby
Fuck me now, fuck me good
Yeah that's right, baby it's all yours
