[Intro]
Sounds are calm
When we become the animals that were made in the jungle

[Verse 1]
Why you staying so far away?
Running, men is looking on, why
Why don't you come out to play?
And get closer to your animal, inside

[Bridge]
Ready I'm like the gentleman that your momma would love, ooh get to know me
Baby, you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up, things you wanna show me
Make me remember the reason why I wanted your love, teach me slowly
I think you're ready to try, walk a little closer and...

[Chorus]
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide, don’t taunt
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want

[Verse 2]
Show me your teeth, and spread your wings
Down and dirty, you're loving me so loud
Play a breed, but you wild as a stray
Sorry show it for the whole crowd

[Bridge]
Ready I'm like the gentleman that your momma would love, ooh get to know me
Baby, you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up, things you wanna show me
Make me remember the reason why I wanted your love, teach me slowly
I think you're ready to try, walk a little closer and...

[Chorus]
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide, don’t taunt
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want

[Intro]
Sounds are calm
When we become the animals that were made in the jungle

[Spoken Bridge: Timbaland]
Deep in the jungle where the creatures meet
The animals come out and make the sounds of the beat
They pull of they skin so you can really see
That you’re dealing with a whole new breed

[Chorus]
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide, don’t taunt
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want

[Intro]
Sounds are calm
When we become the animals that were made in the jungle

[Outro]
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
