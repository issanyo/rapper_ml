[Verse 1]
Me na the best one, the gifted one, Me so talented
And if you don't like me; Bra! Disconnected
Get by my back motherfucker, You know me?
You never know me, wodido, mehn?
You do me
Me na spittin' out jargons
Me think I'm goin' insane, Me need some medicine to be madder
Me brain is gettin' hot but no Prada
Not yet be a father
But think about my life with my brother
Dem haters out there just dey wonder, Me boy so tender
Spittin' out the lines like the weather
Yeah, dema turn around stone me gwander, but me no bother
Me tell 'em, "Go to hell your father!"
Cos me ridin' with the whole world on my bicycle
Dema say my brain dey touch just like tickle
Me na blink once, me na blink twice, "Twinkle"
And me na shout, "Boom to the bad man" simple
Bounce!

[Bridge]
I'm gettin' on top of the world (Bounce!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's all (Bounce!)
The haters see me and they like, "Oh... (Bounce!) Wah the hell is he talkin' about, eh?" (Come on ...Bounce!)
I'm gettin' on top of the world (Bounce!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's all (Bounce!)
The haters see me and they like, "Oh... Wah the hell is he talkin' about, eh?"

[Chorus]
They say they've never heard of this, they've never heard of that
But they keep on feelin' and feelin' me, but fuck all of that
I guess you've never heard of me
It's Me, Myself And I (And I)
You've never heard of this
You've never heard of that
But you keep on feelin' and feelin' me, but fuck all of that
I guess you've never heard of me
It's Me, Myself And I
(And I, Hey!)

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' hyper like Vector Tha Viper
Murderin' every little born rappers without diapers
Snipin' the snipers, pourin' my venom
(Hey, can I give you a hand?)
Don't worry I got 'em
Check out the logic;
I'm puttin' 'em right at the bottom
Breakin' their knuckles, throwin' 'em right in the gutter
Inna! It's just Me, Myself And I
Back then the critics ignore, but now they feelin' me on and on (ha!)
Picture my life like an alien
Never consolin' all the cities that my fire burned
Yeah, fuck it I broke the bond, no strin' attached
Now I ain't feelin' a shit like a dead man without a soul
Gotta go to hell's kitchen mehn, it's dinner time
No need to shiver, mehn, it's not winter time
So feel free to call Jesus every time
'Cause I'm that loud scary sound in your mind, Blah!

[Chorus]
They say they've never heard of this, they've never heard of that
But they keep on feelin' and feelin' me, but fuck all of that
I guess you've never heard of me
It's Me, Myself And I (And I)
You've never heard of this
You've never heard of that
But you keep on feelin' and feelin' me, but fuck all of that
I guess you've never heard of me
It's Me, Myself And I
(And I, Hey!)

[Verse 3]
I keep on blowin' siggy, oh yeah, I mean it
Gettin' lifted in the sky, I got no worries
'Cause I got the dopes flowin' in the veins
Blazin' like a chimney, oh yeah, you dig it, ah
I'm not in my best mood mehn, so don't mind me
High-key, Low-Key, Shit! I'm on a Highway
So if you wanna be like me You gotta like me
But fuck it, It's Me, Myself And I, I do it my way
(Errbody, errbody, errbody, ah
I had a soul lost and now remaining Nighty-nine, ah)
Yeah, I'm living my life how I can and never scared
'Cause couple of years I'll be dead
(Errbody, errbody, errbody, ah
I had a soul lost and now remaining Nighty-nine, ah)
So beware cos a demon is on the line
I ain't metaphorical about it, mehn
I'm being practical, Bounce!

[Outro]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Aha
