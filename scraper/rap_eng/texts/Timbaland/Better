[Verse 1: Travis]
Girl I've been checking you out
And I can tell you ain't been satisfied in a while (So let me please)
I'm digging your style baby
So left me turn a frown into a smile (I ain't tryna tease ya, babe)

Hope I ain't coming on too strong
But you look like you could use my company (Use the swagger)
I know you got a man
Tell me baby what your man got to do with me? (Ain't tryna disrespect ya, babe)

(Listen up girl)

[Hook]
Said I can be
A better man than he
Girl why you trippin' you need to be over here with me
I know you got a man, but he can never be
Better, better, b-b-b-better, better
Better than me

Shawty forget your man, and know with me
I'll have you feeling like everyday is a fantasy
I know you love him, but he can never be
Better, better b-b-b-better, better
Better than me

[Verse 2: Kevin]
[?] you're feeling me
So what's the chance of you leaving him for me
And I know I'm not all baby
But it doesn't seem like he on his j-o-b

The choice is easy
Cause I'm a better man at romance you see
I'll touch you like you need to be touched
I promise baby you won't regret a thing
