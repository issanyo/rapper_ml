[Verse 1]
Baby, I used to watch your flowers grow
Now it's raining and all your petals turns to stone
I've been praying, I turn around and see my rose
But you faded, you left, me now it's time to go

[Chorus]
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone

[Verse 2]
Baby, I think you've got your timing wrong
Hating, exploring this while we're riding on
And it's crazy to think that I could be reborn
If you saved me now it's too late and you'll never know
You're like a diamond and I'm like glass
Like oil and water we always clash
Sometimes my confessions are hard for me
I'll tell you now I'm setting you free


[Chorus]
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone

[Bridge]
With broken wings
(With broken wings)
I can't fly
(I can't fly)
I'm gonna need you to save me, angel of mine
I'm gonna need you to save me, angel of mine

[Chorus]
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
