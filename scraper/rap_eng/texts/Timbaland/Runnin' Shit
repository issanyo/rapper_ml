[Verse 1: Mocha]
Wanna know what's happenin'?
Mocha what's happenin'
Please you an amateur
Feed off crumbs scavenger
Yeah get it accurate
Pockets make dough, cash in it
Broke savages, flow patented
Don't challenge this, master this
My G got you actin' it
You ain't heard you be gassin' chicks
Talkin' bout throwin' on mattresses
How you packin' it, put yo' back in it
Dreams of grabbin' it, stabbin' it
Right, have you blown up after it
I ain't one of them, I ain't havin' it
Act like you know who the baddest is


[Chorus: Timbaland & Mocha]
Y'all chickens ain't runnin' shit
Me and my niggas we runnin' shit, what?
Y'all chickens, y'all lovin' it
Me and my niggas be thuggin' it, what?
Y'all niggas ain't runnin' shit
Me and my girls we runnin' shit, what?
Y'all niggas ain't thuggin' it
See my face you lovin' it

[Verse 2: Mocha]
Tastin' me you wanna sip a lot
Go down, smooth, hit the spot
Y'all ain't ready for the shit I got
Jewels ain't heavy like the shit I cop
Still hustle, though I'm here now
B-days, holidays, all year 'round
All kinds of hustles depend on a man
Shit you can't depend on a man
Need him one day, would he send me a grand?
But he want Mo to lend him a hand
Drop hits, set trends for the fans
Roll with the fam till the end of the land
Go all out and defend where you stand
Don't get distracted, tend to your plans
Get out there and invent you a scam
Never count dough 'fore it get in your hand

[Chorus: Timbaland & Mocha]
Y'all chickens ain't runnin' shit
Me and my niggas we runnin' shit, what?
Y'all chickens, y'all lovin' it
Me and my niggas be thuggin' it, what?
Y'all niggas ain't runnin' shit
Me and my girls we runnin' shit, what?
Y'all niggas ain't thuggin' it
See my face you lovin' it

[Chorus: Timbaland & Mocha]
Y'all chickens ain't runnin' shit
Me and my niggas we runnin' shit, what?
Y'all chickens, y'all lovin' it
Me and my niggas be thuggin' it, what?
Y'all niggas ain't runnin' shit
Me and my girls we runnin' shit, what?
Y'all niggas ain't thuggin' it
See my face you lovin' it

[Bridge: Mocha]
Y'all niggas ain't runnin' with me
And ain't one of y'all chicks fuckin' with me
So I'mma just call y'all puppet emcee's
Mouths moving but ain't saying nothing to me
M-O like no other in this game ho
Force over y'all gonna know the name Mo
Roast ya from the heat of the lingo
Cop cultures all colors of the rainbow
Brick layer servin' pure shit
Cooked up rocks, servin' raw bricks
Copped your song, turnt your shit
Wanna return your shit, burn your shit
Ain't a hater, just no good music
Let a nigga fuck with me, the whole hood loses
Y'all shook up, raw like 50 men
Wanna push up? Hit the floor, gimme ten

[Chorus: Timbaland & Mocha]
Y'all chickens ain't runnin' shit
Me and my niggas we runnin' shit, what?
Y'all chickens, y'all lovin' it
Me and my niggas be thuggin' it, what?
Y'all niggas ain't runnin' shit
Me and my girls we runnin' shit, what?
Y'all niggas ain't thuggin' it
See my face you lovin' it

[Chorus: Timbaland & Mocha]
Y'all chickens ain't runnin' shit
Me and my niggas we runnin' shit, what?
Y'all chickens, y'all lovin' it
Me and my niggas be thuggin' it, what?
Y'all niggas ain't runnin' shit
Me and my girls we runnin' shit, what?
Y'all niggas ain't thuggin' it
See my face you lovin' it

[Chorus: Timbaland & Mocha]
Y'all chickens ain't runnin' shit
Me and my niggas we runnin' shit, what?
Y'all chickens, y'all lovin' it
Me and my niggas be thuggin' it, what?
Y'all niggas ain't runnin' shit
Me and my girls we runnin' shit, what?
Y'all niggas ain't thuggin' it
See my face you lovin' it

[Outro: Timbaland]

A girl puttin' it down for the year 3000
