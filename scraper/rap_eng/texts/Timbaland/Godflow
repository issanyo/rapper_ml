Pitiful pictures of niggas thinking they can get wit me/
Unregular nigga y'all just some regular niggas/
Extraterrestrial flow leak this shit out my pineal/
If ya power level ain't 9000 then I ain't feeling you/
Jeepers creepers these niggas wit bars i b eating u/
Highchair wit tha bib lil bitches I been feeding you/
X2 cause most of you mf rapping now is remedial/
Trash man the city done called on me to take the trash out/
Mashout on any given track I touch now/
Tryna celebrate on  her face like a touchdown/
Then pass her back 2 u cause ya bitch jus a buss down/
Hard work, might need to wipe the sweat from my brow/
I swear to me y'all my child
Ain't flowed like this in a while/
Like bussa bussa imma while
They say my gang is in style/
Tryna stack money in piles
And live nice on a isle/
Ain't tryna turn Cameron jiles
No ðŸŽ“ but I'm better than jiles/
No cap but im better than most
Mac 50 flow French toast/
Ain't never needed to brag
Ain't never needed to boast/
I think I need me a mil
I think I need me a boat/
Hope them labels listening they in time for the show/
Driven like flurrys of snow
Just waiting for em to know/
Illest one in the doe
Wit the illest crew from the doe/
Been kicking down them doors
Making a way for my niggas
The tape gone drop; just watch lil nigga
Shout out to my brothers that still been moving that dope
When we finally blow you ain't gotta trap nomore
Make em pay like a John
Make em pay like they on
Make em pay like they owe
Make em pay like they stole
Make em pay like some gold
Make em pay till they fold
I think it's time that I go
Just wanted to flex God flow/
