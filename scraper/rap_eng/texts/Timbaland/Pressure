[Verse 1]
I'm trapped and my back's up against the wall
I see no solution or exit out
I'm grinding it out, no one can see
The pressure's growing exponentially
I'm trying to keep up to speed with you
Your lane changing is oscillating me
I'm hitting the ground and I'm sprinting
I'm falling behind now I'm tuning out
â€‹
[Pre-Chorus]
Pressure building
Pressure building
Pressure building

[Chorus]
Don't push me (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't push me (Ah-ah-ah)
Let me get off the ground (Don't push me)
To you I'm no longer bound (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't stop me (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't choke me (Ah-ah-ah)
I need you out of my head (Don't push me)
You've got me close to the edge (Don't push me)

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling the pressure
I can't break out
No one can hear me scream and shout
Get out of my face, out of my mind
I see your corruption
I'm not blind
I'll carry the burden and take the strain
And when I am done I will make you pay

[Pre-Chorus]
Pressure building
Pressure building
Pressure building

[Chorus]
Don't push me (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't push me (Ah-ah-ah)
Let me get off the ground (Don't push me)
To you I'm no longer bound (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't curb me (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't thwart me (Ah-ah-ah)
I need you out of my head (Don't push me)
You've got me close to the edge (Don't push me)

[Instrumental Break]

Pressure building
Pressure building

[Chorus]
Don't push me (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't push me (Ah-ah-ah)
Let me get off the ground (Don't push me)
To you I'm no longer bound (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't stop me (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't block me (Ah-ah-ah)
I need you out of my head (Don't push me)
You've got me close to the edge (Don't push me)

[Outro]
Pressure building
