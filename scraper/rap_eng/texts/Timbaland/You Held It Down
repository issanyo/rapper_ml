[Intro]
Where you was
Where you was
Where you was
Where you was
Where you was
Where you was
Where you was

[Verse 1]
Who was there to let you know it's real
Who was there to help you wipe your tears
I'm the one you told how you feel
I'm the one you told how you feel
Kiss you from your neck up to your ears
This shit real life it took some years
I know how this shit often feels
It feels like i'm tripping off the pills
It feels like i'm tripping off the love
It feels real good you gave me hugs
She say i'm all she need and all she love
I'm a real D i'm all the above
Took you away from all the fake took you away lets get away
She told me she was here to stay
She told me she ain't here to play

[Chorus]
You held it down
You held it down when I wasn't round
I wasn't round and you held it down
You held it down
You held it down when I wasn't round
I wasn't round and you held it down
You held it down
You held it down when I wasn't round
I wasn't round and you held it down
You held it down
You held it down when I wasn't round
I wasn't round and you held it down

[Verse 2]
Where you was at when I was fucked up and I was just tryna make it
Where you was at when I was down bad I was down bad
Baby Where you was at
Where you was at Where you was at
Where you was at where you was at
Where you was at where you was at
Where you was at when I was at when I was getting no love
Was getting no love getting no love
When I was fucked up when I was fucked up
Where were you was you were nowhere around
Nowhere around no you weren't round
You were nowhere around but I hold it down
I was around

[Chorus]
You held it down
You held it down when I wasn't round
I wasn't round and you held it down
You held it down
You held it down when I wasn't round
I wasn't round and you held it down
You held it down
You held it down when I wasn't round
I wasn't round and you held it down
You held it down
You held it down when I wasn't round
I wasn't round and you held it down

[Verse 3]
You left me just hanging there
You loving me baby
You loving me cold, look at my whole look at the data shit
Even paid the bitch even love when you hated me
You followed the paper you looking the way you was looking make it you made this shit
I wasn't down you were the nigga that thought i'd hold it down
I wasn't round [?]

[Chorus]
You held it down
You held it down when I wasn't round
I wasn't round and you held it down
You held it down
You held it down when I wasn't round
I wasn't round and you held it down
You held it down
You held it down when I wasn't round
I wasn't round and you held it down
You held it down
You held it down when I wasn't round
I wasn't round and you held it down
