[Intro]
Umm, excuse me but, uh, is thing on?

[Verse 1]
I've got a boyfriend
He likes to fight a lot
We got a lot of common and he thinks I fucking rock
We like to break rules
Both got tattoos
We tend to smash things
And we like to scream things

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't want no problems
You ain't got no beef
You don't want no problems
You ain't got no beef
I don't wanna fight, tonight
Hey, hey
But I ain't going home for no one
I don't wanna fight, tonight
Hey, hey
But I ain't going home for no one

[Chorus]
I just wanna color outside the lines
I've been reprimanded about a thousand times
I'm a, rule breaker
You know that I'm a, rule breaker

[Verse 2]
S-s-s-s-ome say I'm a black sheep
'Cause I like to sleep late
Wake up 'round 3 o'clock
Drink until my tummy ache
You think I'm a rebel
'Cause I keep making trouble
Get here on the double 'for I break a little something, like

[Pre-Chorus]
You-you-you-you don't want no problems
You ain't got no beef (No)
You better keep quiet if you want your teeth
I don't wanna fight, tonight
Hey, hey
But I ain't going home for no one (uh-uh)
I don't wanna fight, tonight
Hey, hey
But I ain't going home for no one

[Chorus]
I just wanna color outside the lines
I've been reprimanded about a thousand times
I'm a, rule breaker
You know that I'm a, rule breaker
I know you are, but what am I?

[Bridge]
I'm daddy's little girl
Bundle of kisses
I'm just a princess
Little miss perfect
Everyone knows it
But that's another day
There's rules to break, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna fight, tonight
Hey, hey
But I ain't going home for no one
I don't wanna fight, tonight
Hey, hey
But I ain't going home for no one
I don't wanna fight, tonight
Hey, hey
But I ain't going home for no one (Ain't goin' home for you)
I don't wanna fight, tonight
Hey, hey
But I ain't going home for no one (No one)

[Outro]
I know the grass is greener on the other side
You-you-you-you don't want no problems
You ain't got no beef
I know they tell you that you've got this pretty face
You-you-you-you don't want no problems
You ain't got no beef
