(Yeah) So you say that you don't think that me and him gon' last

And I don't care what they say I'm gon' stay with my baby

Tell me why you in my B-I-Z
Your gonna make me get my vasoline
You don't wanna catch the third degree

I don't think ya really want it
I don't think ya really want it
I don't think ya really want it

Breeze, blowing in the wind, baby please believe (baby please believe)
