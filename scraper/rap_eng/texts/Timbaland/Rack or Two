This is my avenue (This is my road!)
Come here, you bastard, you (Come here, come here!)
I'm high [?]
[?] 'fore they capture you (WOO)
No six, but I'm lappin' you
She rich and no malibu
Yeah the kids like a rack or two
If he out I'm a foster too
Machine guns, with no killin'
In all white with no wedding
Free the Wop but not Fetty
And he got spots like a leopard
Motherfuck what you say you gon' do to us
She don't know religion but she true to us
We done ate a mountain, got no dew with us
Bitch you know the boundaries, this ain't new to us
[?] ain't no ping-pong
Your bitch got Young Thug for her ringtone (brr)
I'm serving them bells, ding dong
My bitch off the scale, ching chong
