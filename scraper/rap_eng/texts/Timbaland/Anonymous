[Verse 1: Bobby Valentino]
For a minute it was looking like
I'd end up one of those guys
Spending my whole life
Looking for a special lady to save me
Maybe I'll never be satisfied
Had a couple bad lucks and a couple dimes
Now that I'm looking for you
Why are you so hard to find?

[Hook 1: Bobby Valentino]
I thought I took one step
I took two back
I'm not even close this time
And thats a fact
All I know is that we'd be the perfect match
So where you at love?
I just gotta find you, yeah

[Hook 2: Bobby Valentino]
I wanna know, I wanna know
Your name, Your name, Your name
Why you gotta be anonymous?
I gotta know, I gotta know
Your name, your name, your name
Why you gotta be anonymous?
Baby, I want you so much
Wanna hold, wanna feel your touch
Come fast girl I'm in a rush
Why you gotta be anonymous?
I wanna know, I gotta know
Your name, your name, your name
Why you gotta be anonymous?

[Bridge 1: Bobby Valentino]
What's your name?
(Anonymous)
Where you at?
(Anonymous)
When I think about you I get a rush
I wanna meet my Miss Anonymous

[Verse 2]
Only see you when I close my eyes
We on borrowed time
When I delayed the sunlight
Everything I tried to tell you I failed to
Maybe I'll tell you another time
How you keeping me so pre-occupied
Got a strong hold on me
Pay me no never mind

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Timbaland]
Is your name Mary Anne (Mary Anne)
Or Kathy Lee? (Or Kathy Lee?)
Wanna hold my hand? (Wanna hold my hand?)
Come get with me (Come get with me)
Which dime wanna ride? (Which dime wanna ride?)
Everything on me (Everything on me)
Girl, you ain't gotta lie (Girl, you ain't gotta lie)
Tell me what's it gon' be (Tell me what's it gon' be)

[Bridge 2: Timbaland] (Bobby Valentino)
I gotta know (I gotta know)
I gotta know (I gotta know)
I gotta know (I gotta know)
I gotta know (I gotta know)
I gotta know (I gotta know)
I gotta know (I gotta know)
I gotta know (I gotta know)
Bobby V, Bobby V, Timothy, Timothy
