[VERSE 1:]
Whatever you want, I got it, Papi
Don't hesitate, holla at me!
What I'm lookin' for
Is simple, you see
Love and support and sexuality
When I'm with you, I don't wanna leave
I need you just like air that I breathe
But when I'm not with you, I'm missing my peace
I got a lot inside I need to release

[Pre-Chorus]
You fulfill my every desire
When I'm with you, you take me higher (Wooo woo whoo)

[Chorus:]
You're my afrodisiac
You're the only one I'm needin'
When I go, I'll come back
'Cause there is no way I'm leavin'
You're my afrodisiac
You're the only one I'm needin'
When I go, I'll come back
'Cause there is no way I'm leavin'

[VERSE 2:]
There is no way you are gettin' away
I need your love every day
Medicine can't cure the way that I feel
What I need is my inner fill
Being without you, its makin me ill
Stressin me out i need to chill
Something this strong, gotta be real
Nothing or no one, show my skills

[Pre-Chorus]
You fulfill my every desire
When I'm with you, you take me higher (Wooo woo whoo)

[Chorus]
You're my afrodisiac
You're the only one I'm needin'
When I go, I'll come back
'Cause there is no way I'm leavin'
You're my afrodisiac
You're the only one I'm needin'
When I go, I'll come back
'Cause there is no way I'm leavin'

[Bridge]
I admit that I'm a prisoner of your sex appeal (sex appeal)
I can't seem to find a way to escape how I feel (how i feel)
I can't wait no longer
Please come give a dose to me (dose to me)
The breathing's gettin stronger
I need you now, close to me

[Chorus]
You're my afrodisiac
You're the only one I'm needin'
When I go, I'll come back
'Cause there is no way I'm leavin'
You're my afrodisiac
You're the only one I'm needin'
When I go, I'll come back
'Cause there is no way I'm leavin'
You're my afrodisiac
You're the only one I'm needin'
When I go, I'll come back
'Cause there is no way I'm leavin'
You're my afrodisiac
You're the only one I'm needin'
When I go, I'll come back
'Cause there is no way I'm leavin'
