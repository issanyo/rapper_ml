[Verse 1]
I tried and tried to walk away
To be the bigger man and leave
You made it hard for me, for me
Its been a long lonely road
I didn't know which way to go
You made my blood run cold
And filled me up with sorrow

[Chorus]
There's no where for me to go
I'm a long way away from home
I won't go without a fight
You'll never take me alive

[Verse 2]
You'll never take me alive oh no you won't
Ever take me alive oh no you won't
Take me alive oh no you won't
Ever take me alive oh no you won't
I tried and tried to shed your skin
But you've controlled me from within
Your love has been a sin
I won't forget tomorrow

[Chorus]

[Bridge 1]
You'll never take me alive oh no you won't
You'll never take me alive oh no you won't
You'll never take me alive oh no you won't
You'll never take me alive oh no you won't

[Outro]
(In the fire inside the circle)
Ever take me alive oh no you won't
(Lonely treats today)
Take me alive oh no you won't
(In the fire inside the circle)
Ever take me alive oh no you won't
(Lonely treats today)
In the fire inside
