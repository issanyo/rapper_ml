[Chorus]
I get money (get money), I pop tags (I pop tags)
Fit-fresh to death with no snag
Baby, I'm drippin' (I'm drippin')
Drip, drip
I'm drippin' (I'm drippin')
Drip, drip
My style's wet with no mop
All the boys tryna get this pop
Baby, I'm drippin' (I'm drippin')
Drip, drip
I'm drippin' (I'm drippin')
Drip, drip

[Verse 1]
First I'm whipping in my wheels and I'm tipping in my heels
Ain't nobody lookin', no, I don't know how that feels
Only thang on my mind (mind), I'ma turn it up tonight
Now I'm sipping on that new boat
If you didn't know, now you know
I got all the fellas info if you want it I can flip it to you
Me and my girls so fly (fly), we drippin' wet tonight
I’m so fly, you’re so dry
Never had to try a day in my life
I’m different, I’m drippin'
Yeah 'Cause in my head, I drip
In the bed, I drip
Everywhere I drip, yeah, I’m that chick
Got my hair done up, my nails done too
And even if I didn't, I'd still be drippin' on you

[Chorus]
I get money (get money), I pop tags (I pop tags)
Fit-fresh to death with no snag
Baby, I'm drippin' (I'm drippin')
Drip, drip
I'm drippin' (I'm drippin')
Drip, drip
My style's wet with no mop
All the boys tryna get this pop
Baby, I'm drippin' (I'm drippin')
Drip, drip
I'm drippin' (I'm drippin')
Drip, drip

[Post-Chorus]
I get 'em wet, get 'em wet, get 'em wet...

[Verse 2]
Yeah, that's me on TV, no, you ain't trippin'
You're trying to get with me, but your game ain't drippin'
Might as well not try (try)
Boy, you must have lost your mind (mind)
Hey, I'm major (major), maybe you'll be later (later)
I don't see no haters because you ain't on my radar
You can't block my shine (shine), so could you step to the side
I’m so fly, you’re so dry
Never had to try a day in my life
I’m different, I’m drippin'
Yeah, 'Cause in the mall, I drip
Down the hall, I drip
Everywhere, I drip, yeah, I'm that chick
In my McQueen bag
My Louis Vuitton boots
Not only am I drippin', I'm shittin' on them too

[Chorus]
I get money (get money), I pop tags (I pop tags)
Fit-fresh to death with no snag
Baby, I'm drippin' (I'm drippin')
Drip, drip
I'm drippin' (I'm drippin')
Drip, drip
My style's wet with no mop
All the boys tryna get this pop
Baby, I'm drippin' (I'm drippin')
Drip, drip
I'm drippin' (I'm drippin')
Drip, drip

[Verse 3]
I'll be in the back getting chauffeured in my fast car
Drippin' got my competition crashing like a Nascar
Come me Ms. Hilson because I made myself a mogul
So don't get offended if I act like I don't know you, oh
Call a paramedic, I'm drippin' and slipping with my cash
Yeah, I win it, this is only the beginning
Haters, I know why they mad?
'Cause every time I pass, I be drippin' on they ass

[Post-Chorus]
I get 'em wet, get 'em wet, get 'em wet...

[Chorus]
I get money (get money), I pop tags (I pop tags)
Fit-fresh to death with no snag
Baby, I'm drippin' (I'm drippin')
Drip, drip
I'm drippin' (I'm drippin')
Drip, drip
My style's wet with no mop
All the boys tryna get this pop
Baby, I'm drippin' (I'm drippin')
Drip, drip
I'm drippin' (I'm drippin')
Drip, drip

[Post-Chorus]
I get 'em wet, get 'em wet, get 'em wet...
