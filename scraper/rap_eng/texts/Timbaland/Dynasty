Bounce, oh, oh
[Verse1: Yazz]

I'm yelling Empire's over
Dynasty taking over
Got the game in my palm
Bout to shut down the carter
No more sitting'on benches
Watch the time keep tickin'
Now I'm calling the PLAYS
You can sit back and listen
I did all, nothing given
Tho I grew up with riches
Tell little Mally I'm coming
You number one on my hit listt
I'm so ready for war
Brought my soldiers and all
You should call on the Lord
Cause you taking the fall
Now tell me what you gon' do bout that
I'm taking everything
You all laying on your back
Ready for whatever you coming
With no sneak attack
Imma' bury you so deep there ain't no coming back
You over like a map
I told you time and time again that we the ones to beat
We uncontrollable you tamer than a dog on leash
It's Dynasty we number one and we control the streets
Don't play no games round here we cooking the beef
What's up

[Hook: Timbaland]

Don't talk about it we been bout it got it on lock we run it (We run it)
On top while y'all flop all know that we run it (We Run It)
Took your top spot don't be mad cause we run it (We Run It)
You had your turn now its my turn to run it (Run it)
Run it (Run it)
Run it (Run it)
Run it Run it Run it Run it(Run it)
We run it, we run it, we run it, we run it
Run it (Run it)
Run it Run it Run it (Run it)
Run it (Run it)
(We run it, we run it, we run it)

[Verse2: Yazz]

I just shut down the building
With the gold in my arm
I know she used to be yours
But I took her to Mars
Yeah, I gave her that feeling
I'm the youngest in charge
You couldn't stand up right?
I'm the stand up type
Yeah It's the  dynasty
We taking roster
And we did it like a robbery
That new money got us stacking to the balcony
I'm the lion you the cub
Ain't no toppin' me
Pause

[Timbaland]
ERRR

[Verse3: Yazz]

Rewind the beat
Now let me remind the streets
I put in that work
And went berserk
Because I gotta eat
You gave it to Mal
Thought I would stall
I started dynasty
Look at your team light 'em up
They ain't hot as me
Probably, you need Big, Pac, and Nas
Try stopping me
You gone need more than a cage
Try locking me
I'm on fire like that lava
On a mountain be
Moment of silence
Hands up
Cause I just killed the beat

[Hook: Timbaland]

Don't talk about it we been bout it got it on lock we run it (We run it)
On top while y'all flop all know that we run it (We Run It)
Took your top spot don't be mad cause we run it (We Run It)
You had your turn now its my turn to run it
Run it (Run it)
Run it (Run it)
Run it Run it Run it Run it(Run it)
We run it, we run it, we run it, we run it
Run it (Run it)
Run it Run it Run it (Run it)
Run it (Run it)
(We run it, we run it, we run it)
