[Verse 1]
I've been thrown 'round once or twice
Beneath it all was born to fight
I hear your voice in my head and it's killing me
I've never been a fan of happy endings

[Pre-Chorus]
Your love must be tainted
If it's how you paint it
You don't know what you're in for
You're so rotten to the core

[Chorus]
Why you gotta throw me around like a ragdoll?
(You can toss me up, you can toss me up)
I've been sitting back, keeping quiet for too long
(You can touch me now, you can touch me now)
Why you gotta throw me around like a ragdoll?
(You can toss me up, you can toss me up)
You just want to use me up til' I'm all gone
(That's not me at all, that's not me at all, hey)

[Verse 2]
Won't try so hard, you can't admit
Open my heart, you never come in
Can't find my way, through your maze
And in my mouth, you put a very bad taste

[Pre-Chorus]
Your love must be tainted
If it's how you paint it
You don't know what you're in for
You're so rotten to the core

[Chorus]
Why you gotta throw me around like a ragdoll?
(You can toss me up, you can toss me up)
I've been sitting back, keeping quiet for too long
(You can touch me now, you can touch me now)
Why you gotta throw me around like a ragdoll?
(You can toss me up, you can toss me up)
You just want to use me up til' I'm all gone
(That's not me at all, that's not me at all, hey)

[Hook]
I'm not a ragdoll
I'm not a ragdoll
I'm not a ragdoll

[Bridge]
Don't you see my black tears?
Please don't make me stay here (Whoa)
Don't you see my black tears?
Please don't make me stay here, whoa

[Chorus]
Why you gotta throw me around like a ragdoll?
(You can toss me up, you can toss me up)
I've been sitting back, keeping quiet for too long
(You can touch me now, you can touch me now)
Why you gotta throw me around like a ragdoll?
(You can toss me up, you can toss me up)
You just want to use me up til' I'm all gone
(That's not me at all, that's not me at all, hey)

[Outro]
I'm not a ragdoll
I'm not a ragdoll
I'm not a ragdoll
I'm not a ragdoll
I'm not a ragdoll
