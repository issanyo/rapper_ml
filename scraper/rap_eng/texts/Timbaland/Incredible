[Verse 1]
Doin' your thing like you be doin' it, girl
Walkin' around like you've been walkin' all around, girl
Wearin' it like you've been wearin' it, girl
Keep smilin' and smilin', keep smilin' for me, baby
That's all I keep thinkin' of
Every time you be lookin' over my way

[Bridge]
I be thinkin' you be lookin' at me
I be thinkin' you be starin' at me
I be thinkin' you be watchin' me
I be thinkin' you be clockin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe not, maybe it's just
Just my imagination
Incredible
I'm taking you with me
Babe can't you see

[Chorus]
I think you're so incredible
Incredible, I gots to know
I think you're so incredible

[Verse 2]
Dreamin' for you like I've been dreamin' for you
Wantin' you like I've been wantin', wantin' you
Schemin' for you like I've been schemin' for you
Huntin' for you like I'm on a hunt for you, baby
I hope I really catch up with you
I hope you come around the way
I can't wait to tell all my friends
About this incredible lady

[Chorus (repeated)]
