[Intro]
We on the westside of this eastside shit
Who's tryna rock with me tonight?

[Verse 1]
Girl I can see you're stressed
Come rely on me for sex
Keep your thighs in line, and hold on
Get it right tonight and turn me on
Ain't this what you need, nice to know what you want
Not the typical, girl I'm gone
On my mind full of liquor
Tryna think of all the reasons not to mind those niggas
Fuck with a winner, once inside bet you gonna deny your nigga
W-where he at, wouldn't really wanna be that other nigga
The way Iâ€™m kissing her slow
She said she don't wanna see that other nigga
Let me justify why you're with me
I'll be coming in and out, that's what you need

[Chorus]
Don't hesitate (Don't do it)
Girl let me demonstrate (Let me do it)
Let me demonstrate on you
Girl don't hesitate
Cause I won't hesitate on you
What will it take?
What will it take?
What will it take?
What will it take?

[Verse 2]
Bad bitches from Oakland
She could be a model (She's a)
She's a model, She's modeling for
Me while I get this straight (Me while I get this straight)
Tease while I hit high grade (Tease while I hit that grade)
Let me let me get that a (Please let me get that a)
Please let me get that tease while you get sexy
I was getting by 'til I saw you ('til I saw you, 'til I saw you baby)
Now I ran into you, pull a U-ie
Drive and smoke, the fuck I'm doing?
Pulled up on you, pulled up on you, pulled up on you baby

[Chorus]
Don't hesitate (Don't do it)
Girl let me demonstrate (Let me do it)
Let me demonstrate on you
Girl don't hesitate
Cause I won't hesitate on you
What will it take?
What will it take?
What will it take?
What will it take?

[Outro]
Every day, every night, every morning
Right by my side...
You put pressure on me
Anyway you wanted me
I was there for you
Time over and time again
