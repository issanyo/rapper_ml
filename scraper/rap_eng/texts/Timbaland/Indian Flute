What was that one song… with the indian flute?

Everybody's watching
Shits gettin’ crazy
Temperature is rising
But nothing can faze me

On a mission like
I'm Tom Cruise
No stopping me now
I gotta have you
Got you in my sights
And I'm on it
Lock eyes & we know it’s on then

Tell me baby do you speak my language
Let me know if you understand me
We don't need any words tonight
Baby let me see you get down right

Round 2
In my hotel room
Fuck on the floor
And on couch too
Bodies sweatin like
We in a sauna
You wanna take a breath
But I don't wanna

Now I know that you speak my language
All night cause you you understand me
We don't need any words tonight
Baby let me see you get down right

Bring it back like

Yeah that was the one
