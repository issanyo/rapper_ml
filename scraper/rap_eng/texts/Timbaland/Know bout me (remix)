[Verse 1: Ether Q]
You wanna know about the kid from the C-town
You wanna know about the kid tearing beats down
What you know about the kid who's throwing up an E now
To the Q, equalize, speakers rise, clean house
Nowadays they be pirating rap
You cannot ball like shots from a pirate attack
And yeah I know, that was a bit of a stretch
But this a throwaway song ain't spitting my best
But it's better than the same lame shit on the nets
That lack spitting more bout image and glistening necks
Give em a chin to the check now they know bout Q
Take no shit, constipation, alright you know now dude
That them lines is a joke I'm just clowning the beat
Go ahead laugh see if I won't pound in ya teeth
Don't matter if I'm down with the streets
I got connects that'll flex leave you drowned at the beach
AH, little Al Capone
You bout as gangsta as child, Bugsy Malone
I ain't repping no colors I'm just repping my town
Chiraq ask Keef how my city get down
I ain't saying that killing is the answer man
Lyrically Ether Q got a gat in hand
Bar for bar you Switzerland and I'm Pakistan
Enough tough talk I think you understand I'm the man
But Ether all this bragging tell me more about you
Alright I got you just stick around for verse 2
My name is Ether and please don't forget the Q
Now tell me so far what you know bout dude

[Hook: Timbaland]
What you know bout me, what you know bout me
What you know bout me, what you know bout me
Not a muthafuckin thing, not a muthafuckin thing
Not a muthafuckin thing, not a muthafuckin thing (X2)

[Verse 2: Ether Q]
Young dude from the Chi what you know bout him
Ain't met me once so how you gon doubt him
Why Drizzy get hate when he be killing the game
Ain't too many rappers that be making mills in a day
They gon say it ain't bout the paper you stack
Yet them same dudes blow what they bank has intact
They work all week just to be making it back
So tell me money ain't shit; you just ain't making it jack
If I met Jhene Aiko probably get me some head
After smoking on kush take her straight to the bed
Not sure why I'm loving so many celebs
Wanna go half on a kid with Scarlett she a ten
2014 better know I'm set to erupt
This year my mixtape deal had me sorta fucked up
Lack of promotion but I'm over the fact
Still missed my girl for a minute but I'm over that trash
Promised myself no more one night stands
Just need to find a woman to make me a man
But I fear this thing yal call commitment
Cause god damn I can't get enough of all of these women
And god damn I can't get enough of these digits
And god damn I can't get enough of prescriptions
And god damn I can't get enough of this vision
Of spitting for riches and licking on vixens
AH!
