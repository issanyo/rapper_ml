[Verse 1]
Oh Annabelle
Since you been gone
I've been going through hell
On my own
Tryin' to forget you but it's taking too long
I need something stronger than beer
I got a bottle and it's clear that

[Chorus]
Drinking you off of my mind
That's a losin' race
It might be a waste of time
But I'm goin' on a Grey Goose chase

[Verse 2]
Oh Annabelle
What have you done
I've been here until you've found someone
We're out of vodka now, we're out of rum
Lookie here what I just found
Cute little bird on a bottle of brown

[Chorus]
Drinking you off of my mind
That's a losin' race
It might be a waste of time
But I'm goin' on a Wild Turkey chase

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Drinking you off of my mind
That's a losin' race
It might be a waste of time
But I'm goin' on a Wild Turkey
Drinking you off of my mind
That's a losin' race
It might be a waste of time
But I'm goin' on a Grey Goose chase
