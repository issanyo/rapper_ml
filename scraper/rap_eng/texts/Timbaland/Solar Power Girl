[Verse 1]
She don't like the rain
Always makes her sad
The thunder and the lightning reminds her of her dad
Today she makes a jailbreak
Today she leaves the nest
She's packing up for college
And she picked one out west
She's had enough gray
The clouds need to part
Her life's been that way
She needs to recharge
Her family's been broken
Just like her heart
She's always been scared of the dark

[Chorus]
She feels like a solar power girl
She needs to live on the bright side of the world

[Verse 2]
Her mama worked two jobs
Raised her all alone
How come superheroes always come from broken homes?
Her daddy liked to drink
Her daddy liked to swear
Best thing he ever did was vanish right into thin air
That supergirl needs sunlight so she gets in her car
She's going somewhere she can feel the Earth's closest star
She'll lay down on a blanket 'neath the Hollywood sign
And wipe all of this outta her mind

[Chorus]
'Cause she is a solar power girl
She needs to live on the bright side of the world

[Bridge]
Yes she's been through the storm
Her new life's begun
Like a rose 'bout to bloom in the sun

[Chorus]
'Cause she is a solar power girl

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
In the dark of the night
She realized
Tomorrow the sun's gonna rise

[Outro]
And she is a solar power girl
She needs to live on the bright side of the world
Yes she is a solar power girl
