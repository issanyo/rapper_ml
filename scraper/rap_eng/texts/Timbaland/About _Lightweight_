[Demi Lovato talking about "Lightweight"]
So "Lightweight" is a really beautiful ballad that I sang when I was also in Miami recording with Timbaland, and it's such a beautiful song. It's about being very vulnerable to falling in love and opening up your heart and just being able to trust somebody with falling in love. So when I sang it, I put my heart into it, and I reflected in past experiences I could recall. You know, being afraid to fall in love, but just letting myself get to that point and, hmm... it was just a really emotional experience for me reflecting back on past relationships, but this song itself turned out really beautifully and I'm really proud of it.
