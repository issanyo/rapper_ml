[Chorus]
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I am the blue gangsta
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
The blue gangsta

[Verse 1]
What you're gonna do, cause I'm gonna get you
No where to run no where to hide
All the things you said, and the things you've done to me
You can no longer make me cry

Look what you done to me, baby
I can no longer smile, baby
And I've waited so long, just to carry on
I'm the blue gangsta

[Chorus x2]
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I am the blue gangsta
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
The blue gangsta


[Verse 2]
You tricked me nine to five, loving you is a crime
People telling me, you got another guy
I been abused, watch me light in fuse
Said you'd be my wife, nothing but big lies

Don't know what I've done, everything you got
Things you done to me, are coming back to you
You know just what I've done, the things you done to me
I'm the blue gangsta

[Chorus x2]
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I am the blue gangsta
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
The blue gangsta

[Verse 3]
See, I am so amused to the things you said
And the things you have done to me
There is nothing in this world to make me change
You make me want to sing

Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah

[Chorus x5]
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I am the blue gangsta
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
The blue gangsta
