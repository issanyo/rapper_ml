"Tempo has reached critical levels"

[Verse One]:
What I know about flow?
What I gotta do to get a little bit of doe?
Maybe I'mma get on my cheddar and let it grow
Maybe I'mma get a Beretta and let it blow
Bye bye, bye
Then we hardly talk I'm in a naughty car we on the Autobahn, neeeerrrrw
She wanna eat my ? loin and get nailed like Jesus on the cro...oh
Oh Jesus I'm a boss, I got at least three smuts and they all my own
Gotta change they Vagina Monologue into a dialog about menage a trois
I'm a bit of a stallion and vintage Italian and gentleman tailored
See, she's so wet she'll be drippin' a gallon
When I'm sharp as a tip of a talon

[Hook]:
Let it out
That freak in you, that freak in you, that freak in you
You gotta let it out
You wanna move ah, you wanna move ah, you wanna move
C'mon and let it out
That freak in you, that freak in you, that freak in you
You gotta let it out
Let it out, let it out, let it out, let it out
Let it out, let it out, let it out, let it out
You feel it bubblin', it's hard to ignore the bass
(You gotta let it out)
You can't control it, you got a problem with authority
(C'mon and let it out)
The way she do it, you can tell that shawty wantin' me
(You gotta let it out)
Menage a
(Let it out)
Menage a
(Let it out)
Menage a
(Let it out)
Menage a trois

[Verse Two]:
Oh there she go, just what Emilio been lookin' fo'
When I'm enterin' them women, I bend 'em in they denim and I push it slow
I see
Any minute they gotta burst, she smirkin' with women on top of her
And they all on pills and it's all on film, I'm a cinematographer
And they got a lot of purrs so I don't gotta work at all
Do nada and shirts is off
Do nada and skirts is off
And you probably jerkin' off
C'mon and just
Shawty wanna roll with E
And do a little show for me
Shawty I know you freaky cause you listenin' to Jodeci
So c'mon and just

[Hook]:
Let it out
That freak in you, that freak in you, that freak in you
You gotta let it out
You wanna move ah, you wanna move ah, you wanna move
C'mon and let it out
That freak in you, that freak in you, that freak in you
You gotta let it out
Let it out, let it out, let it out, let it out
Let it out, let it out, let it out, let it out
You feel it bubblin', it's hard to ignore the bass
(You gotta let it out)
You can't control it, you got a problem with authority
(You gotta let it out)
The way she do it, you can tell that shawty wantin' me
(You gotta let it out)
Menage a
