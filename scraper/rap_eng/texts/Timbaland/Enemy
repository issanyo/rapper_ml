[Verse 1]
Every time the blood runs to my head, I hear the ring
Something to remind me I'm not dead or caught in between
I listen to the voice and what it says, it's never sweet
Something I was born into, I guess, living in me

[Chorus]
No price, nothing I pay will make it alright
Nothing I see will make it lose sight
Nothing I take will make me sleep at night, sleep at night
When I look within I feel like I should be running, running, running, running
I will never sake this feeling till I feel nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
I'm the enemy, enemy, enemy inside of me, enemy, enemy, enemy
I'm the enemy, enemy, enemy inside of me, enemy, enemy, enemy

[Bridge]
Every time I take another breath, I feel the sting
Everyone around me seems so numb, I feel everything

[Chorus]
No price, nothing I pay will make it alright
Nothing I see will make it lose sight
Nothing I take will make me sleep at night, sleep at night
When I look within I feel like I should be running, running, running, running
I will never sake this feeling till I feel nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
I'm the enemy, enemy, enemy inside of me, enemy, enemy, enemy
I'm the enemy, enemy, enemy inside of me, enemy, enemy, enemy

[Bridge]
Taking my time to untangle the wires and stare into my sanity
Dropping the hammer and pulling the trigger I know now the bullet is me

[Outro]
I'm the enemy inside of me
I'm the enemy, enemy, enemy inside of me enemy, enemy, enemy
I'm the enemy, enemy, enemy inside of me enemy, enemy, enemy
