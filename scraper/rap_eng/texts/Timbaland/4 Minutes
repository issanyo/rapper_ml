Come on girl
I've been waiting for somebody
To pick up my stroll

Well don't waste time
Give me the sign
Tell me how you wanna roll

I want somebody to speed it up for me
Then take it down slow
There's enough room for both

Well, I can handle that
You just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go
Are you ready to go

If you want it
You already got it
If you thought it
It better be what you want
If you feel it
It must be real just
Say the word and I'ma give you what you want

Time is waiting
We only got 4 minutes to save the world
No hesitating
Grab a boy
Grab a girl
Time is waiting
We only got 4 minutes to save the world
No hesitating
We only got 4 minutes, 4 minutes

Keep it up, keep it up, don't be a pri, hey
Madonna, uh
You gotta get 'em all, hot
Tick tock tick tock tick tock
That's right, keep it up, keep it up, don't be a pri, hey
Madonna, uh
You gotta get 'em all hot
Tick tock tick tock tick tock

Sometimes I think what I need is a you intervention, yeah

And you know I can tell that you like it
And that it's good, by the way that you move, ooh, hey

The road to hell is paved with good intentions, yeah

But if I die tonight
At least I can say I did what I wanted to do
Tell me, how bout you?

If you want it
You come and you get it
If you thought it
It better be what you want
If you feel it
It must be real just
Say the word and I'ma give you what you want

Time is waiting
We only got 4 minutes to save the world
No hesitating
Grab a boy
Grab a girl
Time is waiting
We only got 4 minutes to save the world
No hesitating
We only got 4 minutes, 4 minutes

Keep it up, keep it up, don't be a pri, hey
Madonna, uh
You gotta get 'em all hot
Tick tock tick tock tick tock
That's right, keep it up, keep it up, don't be a pri, hey
Madonna, uh
You gotta get 'em all hot
Tick tock tick tock tick tock
