[Verse 1 - Pastor Troy]
Yeah, Friday night (yeah)
Yeah, balling holmes (yeah)
Got a nigga smelling fresh as a rose
Grab my kicks and tuck my clothes (cause y'all!)
Sharp as a knife, and this is the life
Pastor, ya tell me how ya love that?
Let a nigga see that pussy crack, where you at? (uh)
The dance flo' (yeah) that's my shit (yeah)
Baby girl let ya hair down
Show a nigga what you working with, twerking with
(I ammm) low-key
You don't wanna leave? (c'mon baby)
You don't wanna go back to the suite (c'mon)
Let you caress my feet, huh
Now what you wanna know?

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Pastor Troy]
Off the chain!
Damn! Damn boo
Where ya been all my lifetime?
Let me fuck ya 'til the sun shine (uh huh) uh huh (uh huh)
What I do? (whoaa) Mind my biz
No I can't take ya home with me
Baby girl, it is what it is, show biz
Saturday morning (damn!) damn I'm weak
Knew whassup when you came to the room
Talkin about getting some sleep
She's the, the-truth, shorty got loose
Sorry, but all I needed was a pretty red substitute

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Ms. Jade]
What you talking?
I, bring heat when it's hawking
Cause I, can't stand a man that don't understand
I'm weighing kilos and grams the bitch with the upper-hand
I'm, bout to kill it; you, dealing with the realest
Fuck the strawberry's and chocolate (ohh)
Hennessy and a condom, say they kissing and grinding
It's all about the timing; I, really like "Vice Versa"
But, tonight's much worser, and um
Philly chick you only travel with the best of men
Hand me out Atlanta just to see you in your belt and Timb's
Pastor Troy, won't you just pass the boy
In a, split second I'm answering all questions
You dummies are still confessing how much money make you undress
And so tell me

[Hook] - repeat to fade
