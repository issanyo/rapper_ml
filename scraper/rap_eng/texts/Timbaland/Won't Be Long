Til everybody's singing my song
Said it won't be long

No, it ain't no phase
I've been amazing
Look me in my face
No hesitation
Anticipation
Let's get it started
Let's get it started
Let's get it started
I walk alone (walk alone)
Dream in my pocket (in my pocket)
And I'ma touch that moon (touch that moon)
I don't need no rocket (need no rocket)
Ain't no stopping (Ain't no stopping)
Let's get it started
Let's get it started
(Yeah...)

[Chorus: Timbaland & Keri Hilson]
Said it won't be long
Til everybody's singing my song

Til everybody's singing my song
It won't be long
Til everybody's singing
Everybody's singing along

[Verse 2: Timbaland & Keri Hilson]
Go head go head
The world is watching
Go head go head
The world is watching
Go head go head
The world is watching
The world is watching
The world is watching
Some do for love
Some do for money
Some wanna party
Some way to hungry
Tired of waiting
I'm tired of waiting
Let's get it started

[Chorus: Timbaland & Keri Hilson]
Said it won't be long
Til everybody's singing my song
Said it won't be long
