[Verse 1]
Do you know where your heart is?
Do you think you can find it?
Or did you trade it for something?
Somewhere better just to have it
Do you know where your love is?
Do you think that you lost it?
You felt it so strong, but nothing's turned out how you wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, bless my soul
You're a lonely soul
'Cause you won't let go of anything you hold

[Chorus]
Well, all I need
Is the air I breathe
And a place to rest my head

[Verse 2]
Do you know what your fate is?
And are you trying to shake it?
You're doing your best dance, your best look
You're praying that you'll make it

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, bless my soul
You're a lonely soul
'Cause you won't let go of anything you hold

[Chorus]
Well, all I need
Is the air I breathe
And a place to rest my head
Say, all I need
Is the air I breathe
And a place to rest my head

[Bridge]
Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it?
Better than you had it
Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it?
Better than you had it (Better than you had it)

[Chorus]
Say, all I need
Is the air I breathe
And a place to rest my head
Say, all I need
Is the air I breathe
And a place to rest my head

[Outro]
Do you know where the end is?
Do you think you can see it?
Well, until you get there
Go on, go ahead and scream it
Just say...
