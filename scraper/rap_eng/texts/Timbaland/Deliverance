[Hook]
I've been travelin' for some time
With my fishin' pole and my bottle of shine
On these long dark dusty roads
Lookin' there's nowhere to go
I guess I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way
Ayy-ayy-ayy ayy-ayy-ayy ayy

[Verse 1]
I left out from mamma's with my thumb in the wind
The leaves on the ground, winter's comin again
Solid on the surface as I crumble within
But legends are made out of vulnerable men
So on the brink of death, I still manage livin' life
'Cause so rarely in this world are these chances given twice
I indeed sold my soul, without glancing at the price
No instructions when I was handed this device
But with what I did get, I was more than generous
Put others over self on several instances
But I'm back on my feet without a hint of bitterness
And one way or another I shall have deliverance
So I say:

[Hook]
I've been travelin' for some time
With my fishin' pole and my bottle of shine
On these long dark dusty roads
Lookin' there's nowhere to go
I guess I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way
Ayy-ayy-ayy ayy-ayy-ayy ayy

[Verse 2]
Can you recall a time people loved you unconditionally?
Toast in the new south, this one is for history
Then I slipped fell and caused the number's injury
Called the same people and it's yo you just missed them B
This the formula, dammit Bubba you had it
Why'd you have to keep it Polo and New Balance?
Then they start to question whether you a true talent
Or just a redneck substance abuse addict
So then you hide away just to try to find your way
And now they back to callin' you two-hundred times a day
I want all y'all to know, good or bad I'll remember it
And ten million sold in the name of my deliverance

[Hook]
I've been travelin' for some time
With my fishin' pole and my bottle of shine
On these long dark dusty roads
Lookin' there's nowhere to go
I guess I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way
Ayy-ayy-ayy ayy-ayy-ayy ayy

[Verse 3]
Nothing could atone for the pain you've endured
The blood you shed is still stainin' your velour
You took your wealth and knowledge and gave it to the poor
Only to discover that your savior's manure
Accepted me as kin, put before your younger brother
They put a lot on us hardly knowin' one another
I honestly can say that over time I've come to love you
Now we are brothers and together, no one can touch us
It haunts me with regret I never met your baby girl
She's an angel on your shoulder helpin' us to save the world
This musical marriage is no coincidence
On my mamma, Timmy, baby, we shall have deliverance
So we say:

[Hook]
I've been travelin' for some time
With my fishin pole and my bottle of shine
On these long dark dusty roads
Lookin there's nowhere to go
I guess I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
Ayy-ayy-ayy ayy-ayy-ayy ayy
