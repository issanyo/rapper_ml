(Verse 1:)
I ain't feelin how girls sometimes be talkin about
What they don't do, it's crazy
Cause i got needs just like a fella and you know it's true
So come and give it to me baby
I need to have his touch and feel his hand rubs my hair
Rocks my body all night
See i want it like you want it baby boy lets take it there
I ain't never scared, it's alright

(Bridge 1:)
I wanna rock you boy
I certified to climb on top it and ride it im bout to put this thing on you

Tonight relax yourself
I'll be your fantasy, im bout to make your dreams come true

(CHORUS:)
I wanna be your freak baby
Gotta keep it street baby
Boy u know u need it in your life
Welcome to the Showdown (showdown)
It's bout to go down (go down)
Give it to you anyway you like
Lemme be your freak (i wanna be)
In between the sheets baby
Boy u know u need it in your life
Welcome to the Showdown
I can move it fast
Or make it slow down
Give it to you anyway u like

(Verse 2:)
I wanna lay you down and take off
All of your clothes
Come let me undress you baby
Caress my body and kiss me from
Head to toe
Then whisper "You're so sexy, baby."
Don't be afraid to touch me wherever you like
Let your fingers do the talking baby
See your lips go from my neck down to the small of my spine
You bout to drive me all crazy!

(Bridge 2:)

Gotta keep it street baby
Boy u know u need it in your life
Welcome to the Showdown

Give it to you anyway you like
Lemme be your freak (i wanna be)
In between the sheets baby
Boy u know u need it in your life
Welcome to the Showdown

Or make it slow down

Nothin left to say
