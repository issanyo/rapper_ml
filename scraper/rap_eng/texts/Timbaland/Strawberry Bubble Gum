[Intro]
This goes out to you, this is dedicated to you
Dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you
It was such such a mellow, mellow, mellow day
When you walk by, the sunshine
Mellow, mellow, mellow day

[Verse 1]
I, I can't deny the way you caught my eye
Then something strawberry filled up the sky
And everything on you intoxicates
It's a mystery, I don't know why
I let you kick in my do not disturb sign
But I guess your mouth in motion got me so high
And I could tell it’s pure just by the taste
And you kiss me

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor cause I love the taste, love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

[Chorus]
Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
Baby please dont change nothing
Because your flavour's so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
This goes out to you, this goes out to you

[Verse 2]
So tell why, we're making love like professionals on the first time
Acting unprofessional but it works out
Cause you don’t wanna work here anyway
And baby I, girl I'm all addicted and I won't fight
You and me, that's the recipe for a good time
And it ain't really nothing but clothes in the way

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor cause I love the taste, love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

[Chorus]
Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
Baby please dont change nothing
Because your flavour's so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
This goes out to you, this goes out to you
My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
She's my little strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
Hey, hey, hey
