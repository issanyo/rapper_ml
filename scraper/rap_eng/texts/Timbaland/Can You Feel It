[Verse 1: Timbaland]
I would love to see you go
I wonder if you know
That you, and I
Can lose, control
We on the other side of the globe
You didn't come this far to say no
Let's walk (let's walk) let's race (let's race)
Let's ride (let's ride) the flow

[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland]
We got the laser lights flashin everywhere
Girl let down your hair
The DJ's killin it, yeah
Hands up in the air
Laser lights flashin everywhere
Girl let down your hair
Hands up in the air
As I say

[Chorus: Timbaland & Esthero]
Can you feel it? Can you feel it, girl?
Can you feel it? Can you feel it, girl?
Can you feel it? Can you feel it, girl?
Can you feel it? Can you feel it, girl?

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
130 is the tempo
You heard the bass and you go
So far, so gone
That you lose, compose
The night is almost gone
Let's put our cool shades gone
Let's smoke (let's smoke) let's dance (let's dance)
Let's pop (let's pop) we in vogue

[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland]
We got the laser lights flashin everywhere
Girl let down your hair
The DJ's killin it, yeah
Hands up in the air
Laser lights flashin everywhere
Girl let down your hair
Hands up in the air
As I say

[Chorus: Timbaland & Esthero]
Can you feel it? Can you feel it, girl?
Can you feel it? Can you feel it, girl?
Can you feel it? Can you feel it, girl?
Can you feel it? Can you feel it, girl?

[Breakdown: Timbaland]
Let's go, let's go, let's go break it down
C'mon, frik-frikki, fri
Frikki-fri-fri-frikki, fri-fri-fri-frikki
Fri-fri-fri-frikki, can you feel dat bass?
Fri frikki-frik, c'mon!
Frikki-frikki-frik-frik, fri-fri-fri-frik-frik
Ca-ca-ca-ca-can, can you feel dat bass?

[Verse 3: Esthero]
So what are you waiting for?
The world's our personal dancefloor
Tonight (tonight) alright (alright)
The feelin I'm feelin insiiiiide
It's getting so hard to hear
A little more kick and snare
Turn it up! Because (because)
I can't get enough, get enough, get enough

[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland]
We got the laser lights flashin everywhere
Girl let down your hair
The DJ's killin it, yeah
Hands up in the air
Laser lights flashin everywhere
Girl let down your hair
Hands up in the air
As I say

[Chorus: Timbaland & Esthero]
Can you feel it? Can you feel it, girl?
Can you feel it? Can you feel it, girl?
Can you feel it? Can you feel it, girl?
Can you feel it? Can you feel it, girl?
