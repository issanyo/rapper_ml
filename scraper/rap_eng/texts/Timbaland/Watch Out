Wake up!

[Verse 1]
Hey hey
Watch out!
She keep on going when the light turns red
Watch out!
Three in the morning she ain't never going to bed
Watch out!
She's going 90 in the residential zone
Watch out!
She's speeding while she put her make up on

[Chorus]
Pick it up, pick it up, watch out, now pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, watch out, now pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, watch out, now pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, watch out, now pick it up (pick it up)
Pick it up, watch out, now pick it up (pick it up)
Pick it up, watch out, now pick it up (pick it up)
Pick it up, watch out, now pick it up
Watch out!

[Verse 2]
She's driving crazy like the roads on fire
Watch out!
Killing the motor and she's smoking up the tires
Hey hey, watch out!
She hit the corners with her foot on the floor
Watch out!
She likes the lincoln with the sui-suicide doors

[Chorus]
Pick it up, pick it up, watch out, now pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, watch out, now pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, watch out, now pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, watch out, now pick it up (pick it up)
Pick it up, watch out, now pick it up (pick it up)
Pick it up, watch out, now pick it up (pick it up)
Pick it up, watch out, now pick it up
Watch out!

[Verse 3]
Ooh, ooh, pick it up, ooh, hey, hey, ooh
Watch out!
She's in the mirror but she coming on quick
Watch out!
She's gonna catch ya then she leave ya to the wind
Hey hey watch out!
She passing fools like they're going in reverse
She's gone insane, I think her brakes don't work

[Chorus]
Pick it up, pick it up, watch out, now pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, watch out, now pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, watch out, now pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, watch out, now pick it up (pick it up)
Pick it up, watch out, now pick it up (pick it up)
Pick it up, watch out, now pick it up (pick it up)
Pick it up, watch out, now pick it up
Watch out!
