Timbaland
Mr. world wide
Here we go
Everybody say
Dance on the floor and give it up
Baby, put it down and give it up
Nigga, set the floor and take it up
Baby, put it down and give it up
So listen a couple girls
Who was in and I mess with a couple girls
Magazines, you can catch me on a couple girl
I created my own planet to hover the earth and cover the world
I spit so sick so i put 'em on girls
She's tryna come over
And she burn my perms
She tryna come at
Of all of my hurts, place to be
But I made at my girls
Now she just wanna sey
Just wanna please
She want it, so she lives on her knees
Jack and Jill, went up the hill
Each with a buck and a quarter, Jill came back with 250
What a working girl, now work it girl
Like, ah ah ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ah ah Hey girl, I like what you're doing, with all that booty, oh oh my God Oh oh my God I like what you're doing
I love, when you, make, a pass at me, a pass at me I love when I see your pretty ass on the floor
I like when I see you break it down like you in control
I got a girl on the right and one cover left
With Timbaland and I'm out of breath
So go g-g-g-g-g-g-g-o, so g-g-g-g-g-g-g-o
I got a girl on the right and a girl on the left
And one in a middle, and I'm feeling their breath
So go g-g-g-g-g-g-g-o, so g-g-g-g-g-g-g-o
Hey Girl, I like what you're doing, with all that booty, oh oh my God Oh oh my God I like what you're doing
I love, when you, make, a pass at me, a pass at me I love, when you, make, a pass at me, a pass at me I love
Pass at me (repeats)
Hey girl, I like what you're doing, with all that booty, oh oh my God Oh oh my God Oh oh my God I like what you're doing
