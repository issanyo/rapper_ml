Verse 1: Hey there girl hey there baby
You blossoming up as bright as a daisy
I just love seeing you on the daily
If I talk it makes me shaky

I need to play outside my comfort zone
You’re sipping a drink while sitting on the throne
Do you play with sticks or with stones
Do you like muscles or breaking bones

Are you helpful or very misleading
Although you can’t hear it my head is shrieking
I wonder what’s your story have you taken a beating
Or are the bad girl that keeps on cheating

I am an innocent young guy
Some say I wear mask because I’m a spy
I keep sending out messages without a reply
I can’t approach girls like you so my status isn’t a nigh

Chorus: Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I’m all alone, and it's you that I want
But I’m a Circumspect Boy, that you already know
Will give me a chance, just let it flow

Promiscuous girl, you’re teasing me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
I’m a rubber neck boy, Can’t keep my eyes off you
My heart is heavy, so bring confetti

Verse 2: I see you dancing with a blue dress on
I try to stand up and get my freaky on
I’ve been working since the crack of dawn
I see your body move I want your exon

I look around to see if you have company
Your smile is so cute and yet so bubbly
You push up against me getting a bit bumpy
The thought of touching back just makes me jumpy

We start making contact face to face
I’m not letting go I’m locked in your embrace
Feel me up and down at your own pace
Make it last forever there’s no need to race

I’ll shut the door and pull down the curtain
We are getting down tonight and that’s for certain
I hope your love gets rid of my vermin
Baby keep on flirting till my heart stops hurting

Chorus: Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I’m all alone, and it's you that I want
But I’m a Circumspect Boy, that you already know
Will give me a chance, just let it flow

Promiscuous girl, you’re teasing me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
I’m a rubber neck boy, Can’t keep my eyes off you
My heart is heavy, so bring confetti

Verse 3: Don’t be mad don’t get mean
Don’t get sad you beautiful queen
Don’t be mad don’t get mean
Don’t get sad you beautiful queen

I’m not here to dethrone
I’m here to latch on your chromosome
Putting your position into prone
Just be mindful of your pitch and tone

Hang on baby cause I’m ready
Keep your head up nice and steady
Rocking harder than waves hitting a jetty
So much effort god damn so sweaty

We now need to go undetected
I trust you now I don’t feel rejected
With your love it has got me infected
I’m glad you said yes and accepted

Chorus: Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I’m all alone, and it's you that I want
But I’m a Circumspect Boy, that you already know
Will give me a chance, just let it flow

Promiscuous girl, you’re teasing me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
I’m a rubber neck boy, Can’t keep my eyes off you
My heart is heavy, so bring confetti
