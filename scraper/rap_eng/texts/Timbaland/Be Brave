[Verse 1]
Stand
For the silence and the broken ones
For the families who have lost someone
You have a voice
Stand
Out from the shadows unveil who you are
Light the candle and don't fear the dark
No matter how small
When you've got the call

[Chorus]
Be brave
Shine on your light
Where is your fight
Be brave
Turn on your light
You got to fight
Ule iye iye-eee, Ule iye iye-eee
Ule iye iye-eeee aa
Be brave, be brave, yeah

[Verse 2]
Tonight
We celebrate our love for you
Cause you've given us so much of you
For every single sacrifice
You have paid the price
And where
Wherever you may go
I know that you can make it so
Don't give up the fight
Don't turn off the light

[Chorus]
Be brave
Shine on your light
Where is your fight
Be brave
Turn on your light
You got to fight
Ule iye iye-eee, Ule iye iye-eee
Ule iye iye-eeee aa
Be brave, be brave, oooh
You got to be brave

[Bridge]
We are one
We are loved
Let our strength united us
And not divide us
Let's stand as one

[Chorus]
Be brave
Shine on your light
Where is your fight
Be brave
Turn on your light
You got to fight
Ule iye iye-ee, Ule iye iye-ee
Ule iye iye-eeee aa
Be brave, be brave, be brave, ooh
