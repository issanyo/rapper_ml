[Intro]
Wyclef Jean: John Shop!!!
Wyclef Jean & Timbaland: You don't wanna provoke!

[Wyclef Jean]
You won't like me when I'm angry!
You won't like me when I'm angry!!!!

[Timbaland] Let me tell ya!

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean] + (Timbaland)
You don't wanna provoke the David Banner cause when the Hulk come out
The trunk come out the pump come out
You gonna have to pay me for protection
If not when you see me go in the other direction
Yo! You don't want the good guy to turn villain
Children come up missin
Grandma and grandpa found in the Atlantic Ocean
Homicide show up see I was just fishin
I caught two snappers now I'm cookin in the kitchen
You wanna play comedian so I'm the king of Comedy (What)
Crackin jokes at your eulogy killin your family (Uh huh)
Got the Vibe I like my wife beater
XXL and once I find The Source and turn the cross
Natural we'll murder you (Uh huh)
Then kiss yo' mom at the funeral (Uh huh)
And like my man Haitian Jack I be at immigration
A Haitian singin the same old song

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean & Timbaland]
Oh lordy (Oh) Mr. U.S. don't deport me (Don't deport me)
Lord, I know you heard the whole story
About the guns that we hidin in Miami, whoa!!!

[Verse 2]
Wyclef Jean: Hollywood!!!

[Hollywood] + (Timbaland)
How often do I clap take a portion of your crack (What)
Till I walk you to your grave with your coffin on your back (Uh huh)
Since a snotnose in Pre K, kids wanted to be me
Niggas couldn't see me from B.K. to P.A
Fuck what he or she say, long as my peeps straight (Uh huh)
Armed with my heat bake, calm as I see Jake (Uh huh)
Ski stay a feet way, far from them cheap snakes (Ha!)
Cause these rap buffoons be all on that cliche
I laughed at a&r's when they tossed the tape
Now they come to see me to endorse the tape
I'm whippin it well, you see the word boss on plates (What)
Whether the cake or the jewels it still Frosted Flakes
Without the Tony or the Tiger what's Frosted Flakes?
I boss this tape

[Wyclef Jean] + (Timbaland)
Yeah, Refugee Camp, this the next generation right here  (Uh huh)
Don't run, be a man!

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean & Timbaland]
Oh lordy (Oh) Mr. U.S. don't deport me (Don't deport me)
Lord, I know you heard the whole story
About the guns that we hidin in Miami, whoa!!!
Oh lordy (Oh) Mr. U.S. don't deport me (Don't deport me)
Lord, I know you heard the whole story
About the guns that we hidin in Miami, whoa!!!

[Verse 3]
Wyclef Jean: Trini!!!

[Trini] + (Timbaland)
Short money I don't settle for nah I embezzle more
Yeah I'm a rebel and my flow is forever raw
Niggas ain't ready man, bitches ain't ready man
Trini sends slugs let it ride through your Chevy van (Uh huh)
Yeah I got the spots on lock
Bitches you ain't gotta move
But my gun'll push you off the block (Uh huh)
Now you know I'm hot you just hate to admit it (What)
In your hood I come through and murder everything in it (Ha!)
Y'all niggas is pussy, I can smell it from a far (Uh huh)
Trini fear no man don't give a fuck who you are (Uh huh)
I'm soon to be the most expected (What)
Now let me run that back I am the most respected

[Verse 4]
Wyclef Jean: Shells!!!

[Shells] + (Timbaland)
Now when Shells come out, it's back on the block again
No music and videos back pushin rocks again
Back on the low right hand with the Glock again
Beef I'm a pop now six till your pops hit
I don't play around dogs a gangsta and a gentlemen
Yeah I'm spaced out cause it's all about the benjamins (Uh huh)
Can tell if you a thug by the way you shake your hand (Uh huh)
Can tell if you really hustle by the way you move grams
I do it dogs shoot it dogs trust me don't do it dogs
Lose it dogs see your eye I could black and blue it dogs
Call your dogs you a bitch man made never snitch (What)
Time to eat it's the click, black burners nah mean
Sick of you niggas pullin them triggers gettin them figures stop (What)
I burn your block with a bomb like I ain't run and go call the cops (What)
It's Shells ma this man back in your buildin
I'm clappin your children if I don't sell a million

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean & Timbaland]
Oh lordy (Oh) Mr. U.S. don't deport me (Don't deport me)
Lord, I know you heard the whole story
About the guns that we hidin in Miami, whoa!!!
Oh lordy (Oh) Mr. U.S. don't deport me (Don't deport me)
Lord, I know you heard the whole story
About the guns that we hidin in Miami, whoa!!!
