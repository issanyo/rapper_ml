Unh, huh

(Chorus:)
SJ what? SJ who?
SJ what? SJ who?

She SoFlo, bouta blow
Can't fuck with this hot shit tho

(Verse 1)
I'm the slim girl
With the slim waist
With a thick ass
With a  cute face
With the nice cash
Only blue faces
With a stank face
Like Blue's faces
Orange faces
Fuck Donald Trump!
Ain't no fake ass
Like McDonald's lunch
Talking shit and I'll make you hush
Pussy niggas needa tighten’ up!
Ion look for clout, I just look for coins
When I hit the block, Bitch, boing boing!
Bling bling, Big rock
Bitcoin, Private I P
You can not, find me!
Nice smile, Gold teeth
SLWJMZ
Alvinique, bitch!


(Chorus:)
SJ what? SJ who?
SJ what? SJ who?

She SoFlo, bouta blow
Can't fuck with this hot shit tho
She SoFlo, bouta blow
Can't fuck with this hot shit tho

(Intro #2:)
I ain't never get a chance to really talk my shit
Cause… I’m just trying to be humble

(Chrous #2:)
Me, I’m supa fine, (in my window)
Suicide, if you think you could shit on I
Me, I’m supa fine
Suicide, if you think you could shit on I
(I can't stand the rain)

Me, I’m supa fine, (in my window)
Suicide, if you think you could shit on I
(I can't stand the rain)
Me, I’m supa fine, (in my window)
Suicide, if you think you could shit on I
(I can't stand the rain)

(Verse 1:)
When it rains it pours
While I'm paid you snore!
Rainy days fo sho’
SJ For short, Alvinique For court
I got my name on the blocks, like street signs
She got her legs up
Both knees doing the peace sign
What's the shizz-nii-e?
What's the problem, b?
Is it probably….  I'm so aWesome bitch
You look awfuL, bitch!
On my filthy shit,  I’m such a  gen_ e_ ius
Don't get mad bitch! Cause you average
You gone let us grow big like cabbage
Skin soft like fabrics
And I stay positive I got that fucking magic
Disappear
Get it back
I’ma money addict

(Chorus #2:)

Me, I’m supa fine, (in my window)
Suicide, if you think you could shit on I
I can't stand the rain! (in my window)

(Verse 2:)
I don't count the daaaaays
I make the days the count!
I don't wait to get paaaaid!
Just tryna get dem big amounts
Accountant 123, man I love counting
And I shoot movies like I'm straight outta Compton
Tell me what you on, bitch!
Pull up like a tight thong, bitch
Sharp nails,  Ching chong, bitch
Big pockets call em Rich Ross
I got the cheese and I got the sauce
So of course,  he ate me out like a pasta bowl
Money mission, niggas know I'm Kim possible
I'm a villain niggas know that I'm bad fosho!
Bitch Im bad fosho

Me, I’m supa fine
Suicide, if you think you could shit on I
(I can't stand the rain)
Me, I’m supa fine, (in my window)
Suicide, if you think you could shit on I
(I can't stand the rain)
Me, I’m supa fine, (in my window)
Suicide, if you think you could shit on I
Man, I’m supa fly…
Suicide, if you think you could shit on I
