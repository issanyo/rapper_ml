[Telephone:]
Pick up the phone:
Umm Hmmm
Baby Pick up the phone

[Chorus]
I'm all alone
Baby pick up the phone ( Baby pick up the phone)
And call a brotha some time ( Call a brotha some time)
To see what's on my mind ( See what's on my mind)

Baby I'm all alone
Baby pick up the phone ( All you gotta do is dial my number)
And call a brotha some time
To see what's on my mind

[1st Verse]
Hello my love
Yo its me again
I can't figure out
Where the hell you've been
Can you feel me in
On just where we stand
I thought I was your nig'
I thought I was your man

Used to share the things
Things that lovers do
Can't loose your love
Girl I'm telling you
All my life its been
Such a hectic race
Wanna settle down
You I cannot replace, baby

[Chorus]
(I'm all alone)
(Pick up the phone)
(Call me anytime that you need me baby)
(See what I'm thinking about you ,baby)
(Ooohh)
(All you gotta do is dial my number baby)
(I'll be there)

[2nd Verse]
Sitting think here
'Bout the times we shared
Now I'm feeling down
Cause you never left
Calling constantly
Blowing up your phone
Wondering if you're
Ever coming home

I can't think about
Nothing else but you
So there's nothing there
I can't believe we're through
All this time I thought
We would never part
When we were in love
Darling you had my heart

[Talking]
Yeah:. Baby pick up the phone
I know you hear me
Baby I'm sorry, you know what I'm saying?
I didn't mean what I did
You know what I mean?
I know you listening to me Baby
Why don't you just pick up the phone
Be real about it, you know what I mean?
Oh, you gonna play like that?
I can't believe your going out like that
That's real ill, You know what I mean?
That's I'ight then
I'ma keeping Ballin

[Chorus]
(I'm all alone)
(baby pick up the phone)
(all you gotta do is pick up the phone)
(I've been thinking about you, yeah)
(Ohh)
(Baby pick up the phone baby)

See what's on my mind
See what's on my mind
See what's on my mind
