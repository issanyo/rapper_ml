[Intro: Timbaland]
Da Da Da Da Da Da
Yes yes yes yes yes yes
It's me again baby, Timbaland
And uh, we doin somethin like dis
Hear the beat? Uh
(*clapping*) Say what? That's right
Thank you, thank you, thank you
(*laughing*) Uh right now, I'mma bring a special guest in
He gon' rip it for me, like this, check it out

[Verse 1: Twista]
Who am I, nigga with the blunt, steady trippin
Sippin on the concoction, with the gun cocked in
Drum knockin, gotta get off
Bitches and killas in the front watchin
Flowin with like a finna studda some
Betta come off a by the ton, brotha run, I hope he said he were
I'mma flow until my belly hurt
Pimp nigga rockin on the stage and rock on in the petty shirt
Let it ruff, ooh, feels like anotha one
Who you be? Mr. Shystie
The one who make you frown up like the lemon in my ice tea
The motherfucker most likely
To get into it with the opposition in my position
I break 'em off when I give 'em the heat
Steady reefer rollin, bullets body decomposin
I dismember the weak on a Timbaland beat
You remember the deep, conversation we had
When my "Adrenalin" was rushin, check yo brakes and knee pads
When the Twista get to bustin, parties gon' get rushed in
I can make 'em hit the dance flo', brothas, bitches, and hustlers
I get up in the guts homie, never phony
Hit em' wicked when they run up on me
And motherfuckers still don't know me
Let 'em know slowly

[Chorus: Twista]
Who you be? I'm the one that stay high
Same nigga rock a party, rock a body
Make ya throw ya hands up in the sky
Let the shotties fly - who am I, who you be?
I'm the one's gon' get buck, T straight from the Chi
Verbal homicide, everybody duck
With the party up and pimp strut
T-N-T now what's up - who am I?
Who you be? I'm the one that stay high
Same nigga rock a party, rock a body
Make ya throw ya hands up in the sky
Let the shotties fly - who am I, who you be?
I'm the one's gon' get buck, T straight from the Chi
Verbal homicide, everybody duck
With the party up and pimp strut
T-N-T now what's up - who am I?

[Verse 2: Twista]
Who you be? Who am I? The one that's surrounded by the wood
500 with the rims dippin through the hood
Up to no good thats why I steady stay  misunderstood
And I'm always in the mix of some shit
Scoop a shawty and she thick
And the bitch getta grip on them hips
Putta dick on the lips top it doggie style, she my homie gal
So I tricked on that bitch, now who you be?
The one who's on the dance floor
Sex gon be one of the mass hoes
Freak on a bad ho, youse could really wanna flash gold
Turn a hater to a sass ho
Play and ballin up at Cape Town, strippin went down
Stedy, tippin off of CD's and tapes
Though see niggas see Gs to take
Run up to the car, got no thangs
They got CD's to break, no easy pace, who you be?
The crime cause other obituary and eulogy
Photo stank and yall be who to see
Only smokin it with you and me
Lets go hang out where the booty be
Always on sumthin, no frontin
Yello wide ol' belly in the po funkin
Grinnin while I'm bending the curb
On the journey journey for herb
Always tellin somebody to smoke somethin
True indeed

[Chorus: Twista]
Who you be? I'm the one that stay high
Same nigga rock a party, rock a body
Make ya throw ya hands up in the sky
Let the shotties fly - who am I, who you be?
I'm the one's gon' get buck, T straight from the Chi
Verbal homicide, everybody duck
With the party up and pimp strut
T-N-T now what's up - who am I?
Who you be? I'm the one that stay high
Same nigga rock a party, rock a body
Make ya throw ya hands up in the sky
Let the shotties fly - who am I, who you be?
I'm the one's gon' get buck, T straight from the Chi
Verbal homicide, everybody duck
With the party up and pimp strut
T-N-T now what's up - who am I?

[Verse 3: Twista]
The one thats flowin fluently
Make yo baby say goo to me
Whatcha did to her
Didn't ask why I hit her for
Cause the game might get at ya
Get it Get it girl
I don't know what you was waitin on
But if you ain't with a partna
This young monsters a fly guy
Shake a lil bit of dat body
We gon party till we sky high
To my playas and soldiers, shady niggas, young thugs and strap holders
Pimps strikin fees and red bones
Ghetto fees and Gs and MC's for the rap folders
The one that be kickin off air time
From sunrise to bedtime
All of yall need to know me, the one and only
Pimp slash brotha twista from the Chi
Makin competition die slowly
Who am I?

[Chorus: Twista]
Who you be? I'm the one that stay high
Same nigga rock a party, rock a body
Make ya throw ya hands up in the sky
Let the shotties fly - who am I, who you be?
I'm the one's gon' get buck, T straight from the Chi
Verbal homicide, everybody duck
With the party up and pimp strut
T-N-T now what's up - who am I?
Who you be? I'm the one that stay high
Same nigga rock a party, rock a body
Make ya throw ya hands up in the sky
Let the shotties fly - who am I, who you be?
I'm the one's gon' get buck, T straight from the Chi
Verbal homicide, everybody duck
With the party up and pimp strut
T-N-T now what's up - who am I?

[Outro: Timbaland]
Ha ha ha ha
Yall didn't think that I would do it again twice did ya
Ha ha

For the 98 or TNT
Thang ya know what I'm sayin
Timbaland and Twista
Yall fools couldn't recognize could ya?
I put it down for all parts of the area
