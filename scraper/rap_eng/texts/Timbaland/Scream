[Verse 1]
Take a minute to tell you right
And you can say what you want
Turn around every night
So now you're always going off
Doesn't matter what I done
Or if I even crossed the line
You start to holler, go in for blood
Girl, it doesn't have to be a fight

[Pre-Chorus]
Throwing out the blame when you know it ain't my fault
Messing with my brain when you want to see me fall
There may come a time when I don't bother you at all
It isn't my call, it isn't my call

[Chorus]
Hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
(I hear ya!  I hear ya!)

[Interlude: Timbaland]
There's no need to scream baby
I'm standing right in front of your face
I know sometimes we don't get along
So Chris sings the second verse to you, like this...

[Verse 2]
Take a minute to tell you now
And I don't have to raise my tone
Take the level and bring it down
I just want you to know
I got no trouble with what you said
I don't even think you're wrong
It's how you say it
You lose your head
Girl I'm standing right in front of you

[Pre-Chorus]
Throwing out the blame when you know it ain't my fault
Messing with my brain when you want to see me fall
There may come a time when I don't bother you at all
It isn't my call, it isn't my call

[Chorus]
Hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
(I hear ya!  I hear ya!)

[Bridge]
Silence is golden
I used to think that silence was golden
Silence is golden
I used to think that silence was golden
(I hear ya!  I hear ya!)

[Extended Chorus]
Hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I said hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I said hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I said hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
(I hear ya!  I hear ya!)

Silence is golden
I used to think that silence was golden
Silence is golden
I used to think that silence was golden
(I hear ya!  I hear ya!)
