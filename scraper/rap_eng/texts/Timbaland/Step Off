I know your not my man
That you belong to someone else (nah)
Now come on in, an shut the door
I make sure you enjoy yourself
If you give me a try, before you deny
I'm still in love wit you
Or maybe obsessed wit you

Aaaoooo
We don't make love no more (umm hmm)
We don't kiss and we don't hug like we used to (used to)
But I'm still in love with you
Wait
Wait a minute
Now if I drive by your house (house)
And see some bitch in your bed, under the spreads
Giving you.....head
Then I'm gonna turn it out (hhaay)

[Chorus]
I'm the only one who keep you satisfied
And though were not together I remember what you like
So tell them chicks to step off cause I fill your appetite
And I'm the only woman who gon do it like you like

(Hey uh)
What part don't you get?
(hey hey)
Even though I'm not your girl anymore
And you don't want me no more
I deserve to know who you sleepin' wit
(ooooh yyeeaah)
Is she better then me? (me me)
Do she cook, do she clean?
Do she sew, do she sting?
Can she do these things?

Cause I...

[Chorus]

I still love ya baby
Makes no difference to me
And I still wantcha baby
Want to be the one you need
The one you call on (umm umm)
Cause I'm the only one that makes you feel good (umm umm)

Sing it to me
[Chorus - repeat 2X]
