I'm smitten
I can tell by the way you make me LOL like them kittens
No kidding. I've been spitting
To many women but with you, I just listen
Getting serious ain't planned for tomorrow
But seeing you taken would equal my sorrow
So can I borrow your patience
Like I'm the doc while you're on vacation?
But do you only see us as workmates?
Guess that question should've came in first place
Yet you got my heart racing
And I'm new to this, so what's pacing?
You got a man in your life like Peyton?
Other than the one that we're praising?
Cause I know God's heard me praying
That you're the third lifeline interlacing
Cause even though we have to grow to make that tie
I can swear I can see husband and wife
Is something I can see in the future
Hopefully you're #TeamFiya because that's who I root for
I know it ain't no teenage drama
That's why we got to put in commas
So pause...
We don't wanna bring out the gauze
No flaws to be made and I see none in you
Picture perfect form straight from the stencil
And your beauty starts from the skin through
Protruding from the person that is you
Good heart...good brain
Our ideals are practically the same
Girl you leave me astounded
No wonder your presence always makes me dumbfounded
But I'm grounded cause my parents know about it
Cuz my actions shout it
Like RICOLA means "I love you" when I scream on top of the mountains
So let me clear my throat (MM-MM)
So I can hit this note (MM-MM)
This is actually one of the most serious love songs I've wrote
I know that I've been quiet
Don't know if it's requited
But love's growing inside and
I can no longer hide it
You got to know
I fell like dominoes
Can feel it inside my bones
Though I disguised my Love Below
Though now it's time I put it in the Speakerboxxx
I've waited so long debating on whether to speak or not
But I wouldn't be so shocked
If you could already read those thoughts
Cuz every time you look in my eyes
I feel like you can breach my heart
So am I Love Stoned?
(Can you tell me?)
I think I'm Love Stoned
(I'm convinced)
You've got me Love Stoned
And I think she knows
I think that she knows-oh-oh
I think that she knows
I think that she knows-oh-oh
