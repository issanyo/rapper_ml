[Terrence Howard:]
It's like Scarface and then some
Crazy intense one
Better back away bang, bang, bang, bang

[Jussie Smollett:]
Daddy hit your note, do you a little hustle
When we rock the flow when on flip the script

[Terrence Howard:]
Gotta throw a little country in and whoop the trick

[Jussie Smollett (Terrence Howard):]
Sometimes you only
Get one try
(you gotta give it all you got)

[Jussie Smollett (Terrence Howard):]
'Cause I ain't got nothing (go get 'em) to lose (you hit 'em)
So much to prove
I get to far to hear no
(gotta go hard or go home)
'Cause I ain't got nothing to lose
(baby, do what you gotta do)

[Terrence Howard:]
Feelin' like a pack of fleas
Lookin' for a basset hound
Maybe you should talk to Steve
See if he can put us down

[Jussie Smollett (Terrence Howard):]
How the hell did my back get against the wall
(get your back up off the wall)
Hell, no
At least I don't have to worry about the fall
(listen nizzle ain't the time to talk)

[Jussie Smollett:]
Sometimes you only get one shot
(you gotta give it all you got)

[Jussie Smollett (Terrence Howard):]
'Cause I ain't got nothing (you better) to lose (go get 'em)
So much to prove (let's go on)
I came too far to hear no
(gotta go hard or go home)
Said I ain't got nothing to lose

[Together:]
To lose, to lose

Oh god I'm Britney
Gotta do what you gotta do

[Terrence Howard:]
Hey, baby, now what did I just do?
I'm hoping on you to come on through
Hey, baby, got you love about you too
Dormez-vous?

[Terrence Howard (Jussie Smollett):]
I ain't got nothin' (you're so crazy) to lose (lock stock barrel)
Nothin' (you're so shady) to prove (with a heart of gold)

[Together:]
You're so crazy
Lock stock barrel
You're so shady
With a heart of gold

[Terrence Howard:]
Feelin' like a pack of fleas
Lookin' for a basset hound
And he put us down
