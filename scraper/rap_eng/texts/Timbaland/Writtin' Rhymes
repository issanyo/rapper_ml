[Verse 1: Troy Marshall]
This is how I want to spit it
I bullshitted in the eighties (for real)
I had to get my mind up off the ladies
Like these worldly things
A baby Beem and shiny rings
See this is how we do things
When you're fucking with the kings of the streets
New York is all respected
But still we keep it hectic
In places where we be wreckin'
Where we from, Timbaland (VA)
See that's my man, so understand these things
Three niggas thinking 'bout cream
Me and Magoo
Y'all realize we roll with CRU (Huh)
All respect too
That's why your girl ain't lovin' you
We peep the card in the steez
We even got the keys to the bed
Where you rest
Your life is based on stress
So just relax, kid
Because my mack days are in the mist
And you ain't got a chance
Like Sharon Stone on the Last Dance
It's easy past, when I'm runnin with your lady
Ask your boys, I'm pushing your Mercedes
So what nigga

Dig 'em, Court VD, Now I'm sick with 'em
Ate a pack of cheese now I just bullshit with 'em
Kick 'em, nigga when your down, look I got to getcha
Get away with the crime, that's the wrong picture
I'm in a zone like a teen on a phone
H-I with no V, but I stay full blown
Hah yeah yo, put nick out the door
You move quick but bitch, yeah you're too slow
Get on your knees like a dog and scratch your fleas
Somebody on the phone want to talk to your (???)
But I got my life and Mary what's the 411
Niggas get shook when I rhyme, you best to fucking run
Get out the way cause my recitals suicidal
I'm the rebel when I yell, y'all know, ask Billy Idol
Son of a bitch cause he a son and you's a bitch
Me die for you, girl go dig your own ditch
