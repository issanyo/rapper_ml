[Intro: Ashlee Simpson]
They say I get away with murder
Ahh

[Verse 1: Ashlee Simpson]
I took a dose of your medicine
You tell me to leave, but I come back again
I don't see what all the fuss is about 'cause I'm okay
Soon you will see that I got ability to get my ways

[Chorus: Ashlee Simpson]
So don't keep me in the dark 'cause I'll find the light (Find the light)
Don't keep me in the the dark 'cause I'll find the light (Don't, don't don't)
I said don't keep in the dark 'cause I'll find the light (Find the light)
Don't keep in the dark, don't keep in the dark

[Verse 2: Ashlee Simpson]
I was alone until I found Johnny
And he was a good boy until he got behind me
(No she didn't, yes, she did!)

[Pre-Chorus: Ashlee Simpson]
I got a monkey on my back
He helping me get it off, he helping me get it off (Ooh)
Ooh, I got a monkey on my back
He helping me get it off, he helping me get it off

[Chorus: Ashlee Simpson]
So don't keep me in the dark 'cause I'll find the light (Find the light)
Don't keep me in the the dark 'cause I'll find the light (Don't, don't don't)
I said don't keep in the dark 'cause I'll find the light (Find the light)
Don't keep in the dark, don't keep in the dark

[Verse 3: Izza Kizza]
Skeletons and all the bones in your closet
Come out late at night and chase you 'round your room, room, room
You're gonna call
You can call me, you know you can trust me
Without me you're headed to your doom, doom, doom
Kiss, kiss, be high, high
Call it a whiz kid, but not the F-B-I
I am on your side, on the I, spot, you can go scott free
I'll be your alibi

[Bridge: Ashlee Simpson]
I'm your sunshine, sunrise (Got you right)
You make it sound easy for me to cry
I'm your sunshine, come goodbye
My fears done black in the moonlight

[Pre-Chorus: Ashlee Simpson]
I got a monkey on my back
He helping me get it off, he helping me get it off
Ooh, I got a monkey on my back
He helping me get it off
I got a monkey on my back
He helping me get it off, he helping me get it off
I got a monkey on my back
He helping me get it off

[Chorus: Ashlee Simpson]
So don't keep me in the dark 'cause I'll find the light (Find the light)
Don't keep me in the the dark 'cause I'll find the light (Don't, don't don't)
I said don't keep in the dark 'cause I'll find the light (Find the light)
Don't keep in the dark, don't keep in the dark

[Outro: Ashlee Simpson]
I got away with it, I get away it
Ahh, I got away with it, I got away with it
They say I get away with murder
They say I get away with murder
They say I get away with murder
They say I get away with murder
They say that I get away with... murder
