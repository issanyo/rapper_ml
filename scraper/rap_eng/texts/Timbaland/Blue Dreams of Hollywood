[Chorus: Nuevo]
Man I met a girl at Coachella
I like her but you know I couldn't tell her
Cause she had her own fella
And I met a blow dealer
He told me that he was a whole seller
And I'm fly as propellers
Man it's raining umbrellas
Lobby where they hold the best seller
Jay-Z like Rockefeller
Now we waiting in the cellar
I hope your man doesn't get jealous

[Verse 1]
Cause really all I want is her
I see that she's insecure
She needs to admit it first
All these lies
Your lies are going to be your demise
Baby I'm such a lucky guy
I'm such a lucky guy
She's going to try to hurt you
Well it'll be my fault if she tries
And I'll be her shoulder when she cries

[Chorus]
Man I met a girl at Coachella
I like her but you know I couldn't tell her
Cause she had her own fella
And I met a blow dealer
He told me that he was a whole seller
And I'm fly as propellers
Man it's raining umbrellas
Lobby where they hold the best seller
Jay-Z like Rockefeller
Now we waiting in the cellar
I hope your man doesn't get jealous
I hope your man doesn't get jealous
Hope your man doesn't get jealous

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
(Sample from "Hollywood Dreams/Come Down" by Post Malone)

I thought that I would learn by now
I thought that I would never come down
Just last night we was going so hard
But now I can't feel my heart
And ya let me down easy
Don't let me down rough
Don't let me go to sleep
Getting up is going to be tough
They was all acting sleazy
They all said I was the one
And with any damn luck
I'm going to wake up with the sun
Hope I wake up with the sun this morning
