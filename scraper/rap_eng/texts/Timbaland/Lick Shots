[Missy]
Uhh.. aiyyo Timbaland
See what they don't understand
Is we about to flip our whole style on 'em
For, two-double-zero-one (HEY!)
And for those of you who hated (HEY!)
You only made us more creative, AOWWWWW!
(Misdemeanor uhh)

[Missy]
You don't wanna speak my name
Mess around get that ass blown away
Brrrrah! - Fool go on away
I ain't never like your tail anyway
Missy got somethin' to say
I ride down the block in an Escalade
Bling bling all in your face
I think you might need to put on your shades
Rahhh! I know you feel me doe
You hatin on me, but you hear me doe
Twenty inch rims sittin crazy low
AAAAHHHHHHH! I'ma crazy ho
I'ma keep the party live
Me and Timbaland gonna flip it tonight
Keep your hands in the sky
Wave 'em round like your crazy high

[Chorus]
Huh!  Time to lick shots
Time to see you dance
Hey you, why you frontinnnnnnNNNNN
Blaow!  Time to lick shots
Time to see you dance
Hey you, why you frontinnnnnnNNNNN, blaow!

[Missy]
You don't know who I be
You mammy tell you not to fuck wit me
If I give you head, you'll never leave
Rahhh! Stop sweatin me
Flip it on the blackhand side
Looka here boy, don't you even try it
Make me dislocate your spine
My rings fix your shine like turpentine
What you comin 'round here now fo'?
Baby hell no, you just want my dough
Get cha black ass on the flo'
Fool touch me, that's a no no
Rahhh! Mr. DJ won't you play that song
Tell the freaks shake they nasty thongs
Hey boys won't you sing along
Cause we gon' rock the party 'til the early morn

[Chorus]

[Missy]
Y'all don't hear me - (hot)
You got your guns but you don't scare me (ooooooh)
Originality is leary - (ugh)
My own style and I ain't sharin
(back up back up - easy now)
Hey y'all - (hot)
Let's turn it up and tear the club down - (ugh)
Grab your drinks and give me two rounds (zooooo)
I'll break you off I'm goin down down
Watch yourself, I'm about to turn it up

[Chorus]

[Music plays a little]

[Chorus]

[Music fades until end]
