In the crib and she sweating out a good weave
She know what I'm talking about
Cause she know how them gangstas getting down in the south
To get the pizzazz up in the VIP section
Now she wanna do what I'm doing up in the session
In the studio she wanna make music
But she already be knowing I'm really gonna abuse it
And pro'ly make her stupid from all the knob that she be giving
Plus she be knowing the way the shit is really fitting
And I don't listen what she saying
All she gotta know is I'm fucking and I ain't never been
Cause everything I be getting is straight

You can hear the caddy swing swang
And I'm coming through sounding strange
