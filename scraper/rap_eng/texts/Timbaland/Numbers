[Verse]
I'm killing RAZORBACK (yeah)
Them number boys don’t know how to act (yeah)
They aren't able to make a good track (yeah)
So turn around and we’ll clean up all that whack (yeah)

[Bridge]
Twizzler babe
You speak In mumble, baby
Can't be saved
I'll walk you over to your new grave
It's just that no one likes the things you've made
Take them to the chorus

[Chorus]
Come here, Tim (go 'die, be gone with it)
Come Razorback (go 'die, be gone with it)
Water-Gang (go 'die, be gone with it)
Drinks on me (go 'die, be gone with it)
Let me see what your drinking with (go 'die, be gone with it)
Look at those chips (go 'die, be gone with it)
Lemme get a vile (go 'die, be gone with it)
Get It Weeb (go 'die, be gone with it)
And get your water on (go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your water on (go 'die, be gone with it)
Get your water on (go 'die, be gone with it)
Get your water on (go 'die, be gone with it)
Get your water on (go 'die, be gone with it)
Get your water on (go 'die, be gone with it)
Get your water on (go 'die, be gone with it)
Get your water on
