There's all
I said there's all
Hey baby girl, looking all grown up
I wanna know where did you come from
The heat begin to raise I warm up
The club about to go on plane
Niggas speakers thumpin'
Lets party hard
And just move something
The vibe is right and it goes
Goes, goes on like you
Such a beautiful crowd
Levels on the ten
We're standing on chairs
With our hands up in the air
Girls getting real wild
Hair blowin' in the wind
Were standing on chairs
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
If youre standing on them
Soft couch cushions
Careful not to break your concentration
Maintain sexy as she maintains balance
Balance, if you fall, baby
Girl that won't be cute at all
Drink in the your left hand
Girlfriend in your right
Only comes dancing, holding on forget all night
Long legs and a short skirt
Equals one hell of a night
And now Im talking about
Such a beautiful crowd
Levels on the ten
Were standing on chairs
With our hands up in the air
Girls getting real wild
Hair blowin' in the wind
We're standing on chairs
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
I got my eyes closed
Jumping up and down baby I'm teen
I got my eyes closed
Listen to the sounds so hypnotizing
And I bet before the night end
You will find out that
I'm not like him
Take her home, get it on the next morning
Baby girl, give me that one more
Give me before you go
I got my eyes closed (baby I got my)
I got my eyes closed (baby I got my)
I got my eyes closed (baby I got my)
I got my eyes closed (baby I got my)
Such a beautiful crowd
Levels on the ten
Were standing on chairs
With our hands up in the air
Girls getting real wild
Hair blowin' in the wind
Were standing on chair
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
With the hands up in the air
