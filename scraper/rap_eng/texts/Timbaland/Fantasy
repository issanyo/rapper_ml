[Intro: Money]
Let me show you boy
Aha, are you ready?
Fantasy (oh) it could be (so) good and we
(I was just thinkin' ... about you ... and me)
Wildest thing (you have) ever dreamed (boy)
(So what will it be?)

[Money]
Just lookin at you shorty lights a flame inside (side, side)
I'm wondering if you can come and help put out the fire (fire, fire)
That you create in me baby, tell me what you like
Cause I can be your all boy, I can be your love toy
If you ain't busy baby, I'm all yours tonight (night)
Let imagination take us further than the mind
Travel in a dream (dream) we can bring something to life (alive)
That no one's ever seen yet, can I

[Hook: Money]
Show you what it's like beyond your fantasy (oh) it could be (so)
Good and we... might just get it hotter than the
Wildest thing (you have) ever dreamed (boy) let me
Show you what it's like beyond your fantasy (oh) it could be (so)
Good and we... might just get it hotter than the
Wildest thing (you have) ever dreamed (boy)

[Money]
Just think of all the tasty things that we can try (try, try)
The come up you can have will be more than money can buy (buy) (hu-hu-hu-ho)
We ain't even gotta keep it quiet (quiet, quiet)
Boy all my walls are soundproof, I can scream your name through
My entire house, we will not disturb
None of these ol' neighbors, you'll get all that you deserve (you deserve)
Boy I got this on deck if you can conjure up the nerve (the nerve)
To come see what if feels like, can I

[Hook: Money]
Show you what it's like beyond your fantasy (oh) it could be (so)

Show you what it's like beyond your fantasy (oh) it could be (so)
Good and we... might just get it hotter than the
Wildest thing (you have) ever dreamed (ever dreamed boy)
Touch it

[Money]
Touch it, touch it, feel it, roll around in it if you like
Taste it, taste it, then embrace it again a second time
Don't you waste it, you'll regret it, Cause I can satisfy
Any fantasy that you can come with, can I

[Bridge]
