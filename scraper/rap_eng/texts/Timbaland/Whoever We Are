Strange people in strange place
Who cares if we don't fit in?
I'd rather be a misfit, at least I fit my skin
I'm on a runaway road to somewhere
I know it's not where is it to this
And if you try to break me softly
You can try, but you'll miss!
Whoever you are you are you are you are
We're not the same
And we'll never change whoever we are
We are we are all loved and lost
Where you can never treat me like I don't have a name
Ooh oh oooh oh
Where you can never treat me like I don't have a name
You're searching for an answer
Come closer. Let me in!
I'd rather be an outcast, and trapped under your wings
I'm on a runaway road to somewhere
I know it's not where is it to this
And if you try to break me softly
You can try, but you'll miss!
Whoever you are you are you are you are
We're not the same
And we'll never change whoever we are
We are we are all loved and lost
Where you can never treat me like I don't have a name
Ooh oh oooh oh
Where you can never treat me like I don't have a name
We built a home here
You can stay, ooh I'll go
I could protect you
You are safe here
Don't you dare forget!!
Ooh oh oooh oh
Where you can never treat me
You could never treat
You could never treat me
Whoever you are you are you are you are
We're not the same
And we'll never change whoever we are
We are we are all loved and lost
Where you can never treat me like I don't have a name!
