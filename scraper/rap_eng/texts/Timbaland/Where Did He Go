[Verse 1]
Everybody's telling me to wait for you to call back
(Can you tell me, where did he go?)
But I don't never want another girl to come and get that
(Can you tell me, where did he go?)
My train of thought is gone and now you're running on the same track
(Can you tell me, where did he go?)
And now you're leaving me to have to find out where you been at

[Bridge]
I'm a mess right now
Out of order, I'm torn up
I'm going down
Won't you hold me together, I'm pouring out
I need you, that's how I feel

[Chorus]
I re-fuse to believe
You do
Not think of me
Like I do you
If I'm right then
Show me
Come through
I've been needing you lately
I re-fuse to believe
You do
Not think of me
Like I do you
If I'm right then
Show me
Come through
I've been needing you lately

[Verse 2]
People always asking why it's got me wearing all black
(Can you tell me where did he go?)
Stressin' got the best of me I really need to fall back
(Can you tell me where did he go?)
Wish I never said that you and me can never go back
(Can you tell me where did he go?)
But I just wasn't thinking, can't you see I didn't mean that
(Can you tell me where did he go?)

[Bridge]
I'm a mess right now
Out of order, I'm torn up
I'm going down
Won't you hold me together, I'm pouring out
I need you, that's how I feel

[Chorus]
I re-fuse to believe
You do
Not think of me
Like I do you
If I'm right then
Show me
Come through
I've been needing you lately
I re-fuse to believe
You do
Not think of me
Like I do you
If I'm right then
Show me
Come through
I've been needing you lately

[Breakdown]
Need you
Tell me, tell me
Where did he go?
Where did he go?

[Bridge]
I'm a mess right now
Out of order, I'm torn up
I'm going down
Won't you hold me together, I'm pouring out
I need you, that's how I feel
