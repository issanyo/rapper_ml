[Timbaland Verse 1]
I can't believe you be coming around the clock with that same old blahzay
I got plans to drive past you, to make you regret, yeah
And why the hell you be parked with your volume, turned up all the way
I'm not a phantom, you're picking your snare, your career'sin jeopardy
I got pretty big songs, pretty big songs, yeah, yeah
I got speakers and sounds, bigger than dolls, yeah, yeah
None of that,(clapping) in the beat here, beat down man, yeah, yeah
I won't tell you radio go away
[Hook]
And when the music's gone, there be no more songs, no more songs
When the party's broke, I said I still live on, still live on
And when the music's gone, there be no more tone, no more tone
When the spell is broke and that I have told, I still got getaway
[Timbaland Verse 2]
You hear me from a block away, I still got getaway
Check it, I got the feeling I'mma hurt your feelings when you hear my system
Check it, so loud my surround sound will take no victims
I'm not a phantom, you're picking your snare, your courage is in jeopardy
I got pretty big songs, pretty big songs, yeah, yeah
I got speakers and sounds, bigger than dolls, yeah, yeah
None of that,(clapping) in the beat here, beat down man, yeah, yeah
I won't tell you radio go away
[Hook]
And when the music's gone, there be no more songs, no more songs
When the party's broke, I said I still live on, still live on
And when the music's gone, there be no more tone, no more tone
When the spell is broke and that I have told, I still got getaway
[Brandi Hook]
You hear me from a block away, I still got getaway
Baby can you hear me now, can you hear me now?
Baby can you hear me now, can you hear me now?
[Brandi Verse]
I'm like the bass and the trunk if you want I can ride the way
Baby just tell me where you're at and I'm on my way
No matter how far, we could push cruise control
Any way you want, tell me where you want to go
[Hook]
And when the music's gone, there be no more songs, no more songs
When the party's broke, I said I still live on, still live on
And when the music's gone, there be no more tone, no more tone
When the spell is broke and that I have told, I still got getaway
Get over, you hear me from a block away, I still got getaway
