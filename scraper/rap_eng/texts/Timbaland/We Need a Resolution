[Intro: Timbaland]
Ahh.. uh uh I'm tired of arguing girl
I'm tired I'm tired I'm tired huh
I'm tired of arguin girl
I'm tired I'm tired I'm tired huh
I'm tired of arguin girl
Pricky pricky pricky pricky baby girl

[Verse 1: Aaliyah]
Did you sleep on the wrong side?
I'm catching a bad vibe
And it's contagious
What's the latest
Speak your heart, don't bite your tongue
Don't get it twisted, don't misuse it
What's your problem?
Lets resolve it, we can solve it
What's the causes?
It's official, you got issues
I got issues, but I know I miss you

[Chorus]
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt? Who should be blamed?
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt? Who should be ashamed?
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt? Will we remain?
You need a resolution
I need a resolution
We need a resolution
We have so much confusion

[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
I want to know where were you last night?
I fell asleep on the couch, I thought we were going out
I want to know were your fingers broke?
If you had let me know I wouldn't have put on my clothes
I want to know where'd you go instead?
Coz it was four in the morning when you crept back in the bed
I want to know what was in your head?
Or what was in my head? Am I supposed to change?

[Chorus]
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt? Who should be blamed?
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt? Who should be ashamed?
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt? Will we remain?
You need a resolution
I need a resolution
We need a resolution
We have so much confusion

Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt? Who should be blamed?
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt? Who should be ashamed?
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt? Will we remain?
You need a resolution
I need a resolution
We need a resolution
We have so much confusion

[Interlude: Aaliyah & Timbaland]x6
Baby let me know, you'll let me know (I will)
You'll let me know, you'll let me know (I will)

[Verse 3: Timbaland]
Girl, holla
You give me bits and pieces
You tryna blame me when I don't even know the reason
I think it's just the season
Maybe the month, maybe youâ€™re bleeding
Now tell me what's the reason?
Snoop video? Looks are deceiving
So, cut the crying, cut the coughing, cut the weezing girl
Quit the blaming, cut the naming, cut the sneaking girl
I think you need some prayer, Better call the deacon girl
So get your act right or else we won't be speaking girl
So what's it gonna be? (fricky fricky) Me and you?
Or is it gonna be, who blames who?
I'm tired of these things, I'm tired of these scars
I think I'm gonna get me a drink, I'll call you tomarr', whoa
