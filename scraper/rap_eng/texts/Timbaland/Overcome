[Bubba Sparxxx - talking]
(I hope we're tapin now)
Party people
It's the place to be
I come to bring to you
Bubba Sparxxx and that bitch got somethin to prove
And that bitch got somethin to prove
What you got to say?
What up Timmy

[Hook]
Cause I will never turn and run (oh)
There's nothin I can't overcome (oh)
Let's these cats keep bumpin gums (oh)
I'll just grind on and get it done (oh)

Cause I will never turn and run (oh)
There's nothin I can't overcome (oh)
Let's these cats keep bumpin gums (oh)
I'll just get it done, just get it on

[Verse 1]
Enough with the yappin, just cut on the damn beat
Ain't no glory this week, in what was done last week
This shit ain't nothin new, I was put on this earth to fail
I see the future now, my vision's just blurred as hell
I may never do a third of what I deserve to sell
But my story's all fact, not just what I prefer to tell
See we circled the wagons, me and Chevon Young
Timmy, Sebastian, and plus Petey Pablo
So sucker don't ask me, nothin 'bout Beat Club
When the talk dies down, the music'll speak up
A lot of cats jump ship, you'll never see me run
You think we be cooled off, then ya under the heat come
I'm nearly focused dog, and that's a point of concern
Why you speakin now? I ain't annoyed at your turn
It's Bubba K reborn, y'all have been prewarned
Every other dog with a plan I'm a sleep on

[Hook]
Cause I will never turn and run (run)
There's nothin I can't overcome (come)
Let's these cats keep bumpin gums (gum)
I'll just grind on and get it done (done)

Cause I will never turn and run (run)
There's nothin I can't overcome (run)
Let's these cats keep bumpin gums (oh)
I'll just get it done, just get it on

[Verse 2]
You have no idea 'cause all the road blocks I've steer clear of
Failure is all I live in fear of
Chose to compete with rap just outta sheer love
These people (these people) don't know me (don't know me)
These labels (these labels) won't hold me (won't hold me)
These lames ain't (these lames ain't) don't clone me (don't clone me)
Watch it move forward (oh), so boldly
I'm always for the streets, but baby not for the block
Came here for what I want, can't hate me for what I got (oh)
'Cause when I add it up, buddy it ain't a lot (oh)
I count on fast feet to be everything that I'm not (oh)
But put it all together, oh lord
Them two country boys, ain't no bum
No backseats taken, I told y'all
Swear for god I will (overcome)

[Hook]
Cause I will never turn and run (oh)
There's nothin I can't overcome (oh)
Let's these cats keep bumpin gums (oh)
I'll just grind on and get it done (oh)

Cause I will never turn and run (oh)
There's nothin I can't overcome (oh)
Let's these cats keep bumpin gums (oh)
I'll just get it done, just get it on

[Verse 3]
Take it how it is, or leave it as it be
If you don't like my shit, then beat it outta me (woo)
You think you that grown? We can stop and see
Put bring the heat along, you'll need it probably
I never did claim to be the baddest so and so
But if you feel like you gotta have it, so it go
Are the rumors true? Girl had bad you wanna know
But I require more than they've asked you for before
What heapless flirtin', just twerkin', and slick and slirpin'
A lot like my daddy for certain, a kid conversion
She may not want the log inserted, my pick is workin'
Ain't the longest dome, but its perfect to bring the hurtin'
And that's all he wrote (oh), should you just call me note (oh)
Sorry you just crossed the rope (oh) and it just ain't all you hoped (go head)
Daddy with me, I bet you had it with me
Better help me with the hook and she come naturally

[Hook] - (with male voice singing "go over" and female voice singing "oh" and "overcome")

(*male and female singing continues until fade*)

[Bubba Sparxxx - talking over singing]
Say what?
Say what?
Say what?
Want all my macho mans out there
To play this
This go to schools
All the colleges
We will overcome
We came a long way Georgia
New South
Let's go
