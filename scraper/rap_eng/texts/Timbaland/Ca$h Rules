[Surrounded by people, who only talk money
Cars, women I really find it funny]

[Hook: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

[Verse 1]

Just close your eyes
You don't have to look at the killings they did
The dollars in your pocket so swallow your humanity
Insanity
How did we
End up in this fucked up place
This is the end of the human race
Cas' yes i see a familiar face
But the chest is as hollow as it gets
Go lay down and rest
For all the hard work you did
Thousands are dead
May god bless their souls
And i only pray you get yours
Bankers, fill the tanks
That bring down my home
F-16 jets dropping in the cold zone
Last time i picked up the phone
I heard one of your bombs fall
I knew that some are gone
And you could now build another home
Praise the devil, live life like a king
But when your heart stops, you're just as poor as me
And all graves look the same
And you thought that life is game
Always looking who to blame
Oil thirsty nations fund my death
I'll speak the truth till my last breath!
This is as real as it gets
I know I'm under fire, but I'm blessed

[Hook]

(Verse 2)

Cash rules everything around me, so
Follow the dollar and swallow your humanity
Everybody's mad at me
They're calling me a racist
But can they erase the faces
That burned after they raided
Our nations, just to steal the precious resources
My prayers go out to all the corpses
That will never be spoken of
Because they don't look good in the notion of
The dream, I'm not gonna mention any country
I want you to think
I know its hard, to a brainwashed kid
The dream is to (get the dolla bill)
I want you to feel all the pain we did
Not just the war, but what came with it
Motherfuckers calling me a terrorist
But yet they don't know what terror is
They just say it for the hell of it

[Hook]
