[Intro]
Not that i'm cocky or anything
But any other nigga that i'm fucking with
Any other bitch that he had or that he will have
It doesn't matter that bitch could cook for u
That bitch is prettier than me
That bitch can have more money than me it doesn't matter
Cause could round all them hoes up
Dick sucking contest i'm winning

[Chorus]
In a world full of pretty ass women all i see is you
In a world full of big ol booty stippers all i see is, you
In a world where they fucking cause you next
All i see is you the best baby fuck the rest
All i all i, all i see is you babe
Oh my oh my all i see is you babe
All i all i, all i see is you babe
Oh my oh my all i see is you babe

[Verse 1]
She never need a man and I know that she gon go and get the dough
And she could make it back, go get it
Shawty never go without the cashflow, she don't
Stake the stake she going where the cash go
Keep them broke ass niggas far away from her
Small circle of friends, stay away from drama
All Day everyday put her kids first
Never settle for whatever cause shawty know her worth
Your independence makes you so sexy girl i can't believe it
Got me all up in my feelings
Always on ma mind girl you super duper stupid fine and you're mine
Everytime you walk by so fly I wish i could press rewind
Girl you a dime i wish i could multiply you

[Chorus]
In a world full of pretty ass women all i see is you
In a world full of big ol booty stippers all i see is, you
In a world where they fucking cause you next
All i see is you the best baby fuck the rest
All i all i, all i see is you babe
Oh my oh my all i see is you babe
All i all i, all i see is you babe
Oh my oh my all i see is you babe
