[Intro: Cee Lo]
Don't know what's wrong
Picked up my clothes, almost had the popo come get me
Oh and my mama said I should leave you alone
I got the feeling love ain't enough

[Verse 1: Cee Lo]
Oh listen
Last night I was up on tipsy
Wondering how long I gotta wait 'til you come back to me
She don't believe me when I said that women don't know me
And all the good I've done, now she wanna walk out and leave me
She don't wanna keep my love
I'm telling you love just ain't enough
For a woman, for a woman
Hey, and I never said I was perfect
And I know it ain't easy to love me
She's packing her bags and she won't come back
Aye, but she loves me

[Verse 2: Monica]
Get 'em, girl
You got me feeling like I ain't ever been in your corner, baby
Like I ain't been steady campaigning for you to be the man you want to lately
I'm wondering if you can see the difference
Cause all you do is nitpick, measure me to your last chick
Oh and we don't know if we're gonna make it
It hurts for me to say this, but are we gonna make it?
Cause you ain't gotta trip on me, and you tell your mama everything
Keep on talking 'bout the things I don't do
But what about the things I taught you, lil' nigga?
Cause you know like I know
You know my love's just good enough for you, baby
You got me trippin' 'bout everything, everything
You don't even try to be what it takes to be
What it takes to be the one for me
Keep on trippin', you gon' lose a good thing

[Outro: Cee Lo and Monica]
He loves her
And I love her
She loves him
But love ain't enough sometimes
But she loves me
Sometimes the beautiful things get ugly
I can't give up on what we've got
Love ain't enough
Love ain't enough
Love just ain't enough
Love ain't enough
Love just ain't enough
Love ain't enough
