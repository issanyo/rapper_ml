[Intro: Timbaland]
Here we go now
Don't, don't, don't stop the music
Here we go now

[Verse 1: Michelle Branch]
Monday comes like a loaded gun
And I'm trying to escape
Want to run, wanna chase the sun
Let it wash the world away
Looking out on an empty street
Thinking change is what I need
I feel slow, there's an open road
And I need some sweet release

[Chorus: Michelle Branch]
I-I-I wanna getaway, gotta getaway
Going where the road meets the sky
Cause I need a change
Yeah, I need a change
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na...
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na...

[Verse 2: Michelle Branch]
Sleepless nights cause the city lights
Make the moon so hard to see
Take a ride to the other side
Give me room where I can breathe
Shout it out to the breaking dawn
Feel the earth under your feet
Open door, what you waiting for?
Let the rain come down on me

[Chorus: Michelle Branch]
I-I-I wanna getaway, gotta getaway
Going where the road meets the sky
Cause I need a change
Yeah, I need a change
I-I-I wanna getaway, gotta getaway
Going where the road meets the sky
Cause I need a change
Yeah, I need a change
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na...
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na...
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na... (I wanna get away)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na... (gotta get away)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na... (I wanna get away)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na... (gotta getta away)

[Outro: Timbaland]
Freaky, freaky here we go now
Don't, don't, don't stop the music
Freaky, freaky here we go now
Freaky, freaky...
