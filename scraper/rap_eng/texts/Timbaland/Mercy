[Verse 1]
Angel of Mercy, how did you find me?
Where did you read my story?
Pulled from the papers, desperate and hardened
Seeking a momentary fix

[Pre-Chorus]
All I wanted to say, all I wanted to do, has fallen apart now
All I wanted to feel, I wanted to love, it's all my fault now
A tragedy, I fear

[Chorus]
Angel of Mercy, how did you find me?
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of Mercy, how did you move me?
Why am I on my feet again?
And I see you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I feel you
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 2]
Fortress of daylight, caught me on standby
Waiting to catch the quickest plane
Fly me to nowhere, it's better than somewhere
That's where I've been and nothing's changed

[Pre-Chorus]
All I wanted to say, all I wanted to do, has fallen apart now
All I wanted to feel, I wanted to love, it's all my fault now
A tragedy, I fear

[Chorus]
Angel of Mercy, how did you find me?
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of Mercy, how did you move me?
Why am I on my feet again?
And I see you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I feel you
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Bridge]
A tragedy, seemed to be, but what now?
Oh, now
A tragedy, it seemed to be, but what now?

[Chorus]
Angel of Mercy, how did you find me?
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of Mercy, how did you move me?
Why am I on my feet again?
And I see you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I feel you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I feel you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I feel you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
