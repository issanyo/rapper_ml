[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Baby, baby, when we first met
I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped into one, with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden, you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shot that spun me around and now my heart left
I feel so empty and hollow

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

[Chorus: Rihanna]
And now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

[Post-Chorus]
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?
You'll do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me, I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way that I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
You gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

[Chorus: Rihanna]
'Cause now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed (using like I bleed)

[Post-Chorus]
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake & Rihanna]
Now ladies, gimme that
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, now gimme that
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Now ladies, gimme that
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, now gimme that
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door

[Chorus/utro Rihanna]
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease
