[Intro]
How y'all doin' out there tonight?
Ha, yes, I love you too
I just wanna talk to the ladies tonight
For all you ladies
That done had your heart broken
I done had my heart broken too
So I can relate, ya know
So if it's okay with you, I'm just gonna break it down
For the fellas that don't know
That they can break a woman's heart
Alright?
So check it out, uh

[Verse 1]
I gave you all of my love (mmm)
All to you (mmm)
And you don't appreciate the things
That I do (things that I do)
I gave you all of my time
'cause you blew my mind
I let you do me wrong
'cause love had me so blind
(I once was)

[Chorus]
I once was young, but
I'm all grown up, and
I know 'bout love, and
I used to love you
You tried to play me
And then persuade me
I still remember
The pain ya gave me
I can't believe you
I gotta leave you
I'm packin' up and
You can hit the road Jack
You can take these
Things that you gave me
'cause I'm never comin' back

[Verse 2]
All I wanted was a little love
But you chose to hang out
All night with the boys (the boys)
So what are you saying?
And quit wastin' time
(quit wasting my time)
Trying to claim something
That's not even mine
(I once was)

[Chorus]
I once was young, but
I'm all grown up, and
I know 'bout love, and
I used to love you
You tried to play me
And then persuade me
I still remember
The pain ya gave me
I can't believe you
I gotta leave you
I'm packin' up and
You can hit the road Jack
You can take these
Things that you gave me
'cause I'm never comin' back

[Bridge]
Why you hurt me?
(why you hurt me?)
Why you hurting me so bad?
Gave you my time
You played with my mind
Why you wanna make me sad?
Why you hurt me?
(why you hurt me?)
Why you hurting me so bad?
Gave you my time
You played with my mind
Why you wanna make me sad?
