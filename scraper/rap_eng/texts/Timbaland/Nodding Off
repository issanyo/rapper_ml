[Verse 1]
I tried to stay up, cause you're on your way up
For the weekend, said you wanna see me again
Said you'd be over, still ain't seen your Rover
Looking out my window it's a quarter to ten
It's about that time, I really can't stay hot
Know you wanna kick it, and I was with it
But I won't be trippin' if you don't show
Boy, hear you knockin'
They got vacancy at the Howard Johnson, you know

[Chorus]
Don't try to call me, cause the ringer's off
Don't try to page me, my Two-way is lost
I had a Jones for ya, but it seems you lost
I tried to wait for ya, but I'm nodding off

[Verse 2]
Watched Forrest Gump and put something on my stomach
I called my cousin, listened to her gossiping mouth
Touched up my makeup, anything to wake up
Trying to take up some time while I'm waiting it out
What's the hold up?
Thought you would've rolled up in the driveway
Before the day gave
Why should I wait?
I'm sleepy as hell and there's
No way I can abort this mission, so listen

[Chorus]
Don't try to call me, cause the ringer's off
Don't try to page me, my Two-way is lost
I had a Jones for ya, but it seems you lost
I tried to wait for ya, but I'm nodding off

[Bridge]
No hard feelings really
I'm already under the cover
Please don't be mad at me
You gotta believe I still love you

[Chorus]
Don't try to call me, cause the ringer's off
Don't try to page me, my Two-way is lost
I had a Jones for ya, but it seems you lost
I tried to wait for ya, but I'm nodding off
