Yo baby
I see you lookin' at me
Word up, just talk to me
And tell me what's on your mind, haha

[Missy]
When I'm alone, I close my eyes
To think of you by my side
When I'm asleep, I always dream
That you and me were doing our own thang
So is it hard for you to stop by my way
And watch a little TV, lay back and conversate

[Sista]
I don't mind if you don't mind
Baby we can spend some time
I don't mind if you don't mind
Baby we can spend some time

[Missy]
Uh, it feels so good when I'm looking in your eyes
Bodies, huggin' it's warm, all this wrapped so tight
Lay back, fantasizing
Of me and you layin' together, realizing

[Sista]
I don't mind if you don't mind
Baby we can spend some time
I don't mind if you don't mind
Baby we can spend some time

[Missy's Rap]
Uh, Scooby-Scooby Doo's got me good in my duty
And I'm checkin' out these cuties

Yo I'm checkin' out the fly gear that my bigger nigga's sportin'

Yo, Mr. lover wants my body
Cause he see that I'm a hottie, surprise me
And I gotta make 'em cute
And make 'em wanna wanna uh, uh, uh, uh, down my boots
So you best be keepin' your composure
Or turn the motive, I told ya down town means lower
So if you got a problem sugar take your time
Cause if you don't mind baby I don't mind

[Sista]
I don't mind if you don't mind
Baby we can spend some, can spend some time

[Sista]
