[Verse 1]
I gave up the fight for love
Walked away took off the gloves
No more wishing on a star
Waiting for someone
What if no one ever comes

[Pre-Chorus]
So I kept my eyes closed, hands up, dancing by myself
Oh, I never felt nothing better
Baby how could I know you'd come crashing down from Heaven
Now my heart is open forever

[Chorus]
I don't have to sleep to dream
I can hardly believe what I see
When you stand before me
You're everything I never thought
That I would ever find
Now I don't have to sleep to dream
You're a dream to me

[Verse 2]
There's a cure for bleeding hearts
Think you showed me where to start
Everytime I lose my grip
You keep me hangin' on
You remind that I'm strong

[Pre-Chorus]
So I kept my eyes closed, hands up, dancing by myself
Oh, I never felt nothing better
Baby how could I know you'd come crashing down from Heaven
Now my heart is open forever

[Chorus]
I don't have to sleep to dream
I can hardly believe what I see
When you stand before me
You're everything I never thought
That I would ever find
Now I don't have to sleep to dream
You're a dream
You're a dream
To me

[Hook]
I don't have to sleep to dream
I can hardly believe what I see
When you stand before me
You're everything I never thought
That I would ever find
Now I don't have to sleep to dream
You're a dream
You're a dream to me
