[Intro: Timbaland]
Come here girl, come here girl, come here girl, bounce
Come here girl, come here girl, come here girl, bounce
Come here girl, come here girl, come here girl, bounce
Come here girl, come here girl, come here gi- ir- rl

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
Let me see them big titties
Don't be actin' sad-idy you're not pretty
Break bread if you wanna get with me
All I wanna do is dig up in them kidneys
Tell your boyfriend he better mind his business
'Fore he end up in the trunk of my Bentley
I'm considered a boss, you can't get me
You ain't got enough paper to deal with me
Baby girl wanna two step with me
Turn around with her ass up against me
Roll along and got tipsy, hit it tonight, tomorrow you the mystery
All you haters on that ho shit miss me
I stay strapped, security don't frisk me
Fed it off 'til the motherfucker empty
I'll turn around and do the same shit next week, come on

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
(Bounce) like your ass had the hiccups
(Bounce) like we was ridin' in my pickup
(Bounce) why you lookin' so sad, baby girl? You need to cheer up
(Bounce) I got the remedy, it's you on me and me on you
It's you on me and me on you and you on her
And her on me, and her on you, and y'all on me
And me on y'all and y'all on me
Menage a trois, ménage à trois ahh uhh

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
There she go, just what the doc's been lookin for
She just what I need, lookin Chinese like Sum Yung Ho
I got a bungalow, we can disappear for a week or so
Yeah, I gotta stadium flow, Superbowl with it like I'm Dungy, yo
Oh, yes, congratulations, you run a millionaire invitation
Sorry I'm so demanding
You can save the dancing for back at the mansion
And this money handsome, ain't that a panty anthem?
I kill me, just like you from the back, you'll see

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
(Bounce) like your ass had the hiccups
(Bounce) like we was ridin' in my pickup
(Bounce) why you lookin' so sad, baby girl? You need to cheer up
(Bounce) I got the remedy, it's you on me and me on you
It's you on me and me on you and you on her
And her on me, and her on you, and y'all on me
And me on y'all and y'all on me
Menage a trois, ménage à trois ahh uhh

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
Hold up, hell naw, like Britney Spears I wear no drawls
In the club I drink it up, goomp goomp, drink it up
Got Patron sippin' in my cup, hey, where's your man?
I bet that I could make him love me, oooh
When he see the jugs he will wanna rush to get a quick touch
Of this big ole butt, mmmhmmm, big ole butt
Thick legs, big ole jugs, legs stick like rims on the truck
Take 'em to the crib, yeah we gon' fuck
You could call me a freak, I like to get BUCK, BUCK
And I don't have to do much to make him get it up
Sum Yung Ho, she worth two dollars
I'm worth more dollars than make up beauty parlors
I pop collars, ca-ca-ca-ca-collars
I don't buy shots, I only buy the bottles
Only rich girls, we only buy the bottles
But like a porn star, I'm best when to swallow

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
(Bounce) like your ass had the hiccups
(Bounce) like we was ridin' in my pickup
(Bounce) why you lookin' so sad, baby girl? You need to cheer up
(Bounce) I got the remedy, it's you on me and me on you
It's you on me and me on you and you on her
And her on me, and her on you, and y'all on me
And me on y'all and y'all on me
Menage a trois, ménage à trois ahh uhh
