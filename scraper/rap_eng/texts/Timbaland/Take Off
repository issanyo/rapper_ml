[Bubba Sparxxx]
I can't forget the bumps on the road to Hartsville
Andy's scared to fly, but surely Bubba Sparxxx will

Shit and I ain't slept, in a month of Sundays
Still I'm wide awake as we coast out on the runway

And now the captain says I'm number one for take off
But Timmy I'm too weak all this starvin led to weight loss

Fear turns to adrenaline as life accelerates
I'm headed to my destiny, how long you guess it takes - to get there?

The in flight movie today is "Gladiator"
But I can't afford the headphones, it's cool, I'll catch it later

I'm cramped between two dudes, one from each coast
Yet we all agree a safe flight is what we need most

Hey stewardess, I can't handle all this turbulence
The ride's gettin bumpy and that shit don't help my nervousness

Now they fin' to serve the meal, I think I'll go with steak
Every fuckin choice is crucial and we all know the breaks, in this game

I barely even noticed but we covered every state
Plus I'm slowly turnin from feather to heavyweight - it's about time

I need to take a piss but I'm still scared to get up
Please Lord protect those up in this air with us

The captain just started our approach into the sunset
I've flown a million miles but the shit still ain't fun yet

When this journey is complete, you'll know by my reaction
Tears of jubilation as I'm landin back in Athens - thank you Lord
