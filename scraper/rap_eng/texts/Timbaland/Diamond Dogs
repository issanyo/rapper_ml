[Verse 1]
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicon hump
And your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Todd Browning's freak he was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and your knees
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal

[Chorus]
Will they come?
I keep a friend serene
Will they come?
Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come?
Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girls, they call them the Diamond Dogs

[Verse 2]
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the board-walk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
There's gonna be sorrow
Try and wake up for tomorrow
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevators broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below
Oh Tarzie, go man, go

[Chorus]
Will they come?
I keep a friend serene
Will they come?
Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come?
Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch a death in the fog
Young girls, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Girls, they call them the Diamond Dogs

[Outro]
Who who who who
Who who who who
Who who who who
Who who who who

Who who who who
They call them the Diamond Dogs
Who who who who
Who who who who
They call them the Diamond Dogs
Who who who who
Who who who who
They call them the Diamond Dogs
Who who who who
Who who who who
They call them the Diamond Dogs
Who who who who
Who who who who
They call them the Diamond Dogs
Who who who who
Who who who who
They call them the Diamond Dogs
Who who who who
Who who who who
They call them the Diamond Dogs
Who who who who
