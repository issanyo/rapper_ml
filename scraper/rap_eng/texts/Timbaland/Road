[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm walking down the road of lonely hearts
Wondering how love can do us part
Sometimes I think that we were meant to be
Living in the world of fantasy

[Chorus]
Well, don't you know you gotta go all the way down the road
Feel the sun, baby, heating your soul
Learn how to live with your highs and your lows
I'm on your side
Well, don't you know you gotta go all the way down the road
Feel the sun, baby, heating your soul
Learn how to live with your highs and your lows
I'm on your side

[Post-Chorus]
Well, don't you know you gotta go
Well, don't you know you gotta go (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
All the way down the road (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
I'm standing on the line waiting on the cure
Worried if I might ever shine this pure
And somehow I thought that I'd find you anywhere you run
But walking after you haven't felt so fun

[Chorus]
Well, don't you know you gotta go all the way down the road
Feel the sun, baby, heating your soul
Learn how to live with your highs and your lows
I'm on your side

[Post-Chorus]
Well, don't you know you gotta go
Ooh-ooh, way down the road
Well, don't you know you gotta go (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Outro]
All the
All the way
All the way down the road
