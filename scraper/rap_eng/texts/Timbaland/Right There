Put that over there, that's that shit right there
What's that over there? That's that shit right there
What's that on the right side? That's that shit right there
What's that on the left side? That's that shit right there
That's that shit right there, that's that shit right there
That's that shit right there, that's that shit right there
Shorty on the right side, that's that shit right there
When I pull up on the corner, they say, that's that shit right there

[Verse 1]
Lights, camera, action, tonight gon' be a movie
I just ordered 50 bottles of Ciroc, Rose and Goose
I got bad women everywhere, at least three of 'em choosin'
Red bottoms on the sofa up in VIP, sue me
For bein' young and reckless, wild and imperfectious
Blew a hundred hundred on a stripper then finesse her
I don't give a (whoa) see I'm just doin' what I want
See I'm young and I got money, light it up just like a blunt
Haters on the sideline, I don't really care
Stackin' money to the ceilin', yeah we ballin' everywhere
Empire state of mind, this is our year
Prince of America, I'm that shit right there

[Hook]
Put that over there, that's that shit right there
What's that over there? That's that shit right there
What's that on the right side? That's that shit right there
What's that on the left side? That's that shit right there
That's that shit right there, that's that shit right there
That's that shit right there, that's that shit right there
Shorty on the right side, that's that shit right there
When I pull up on the corner, they say, "that's that shit right there
