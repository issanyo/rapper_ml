Ooh ooh ah!
Check me out baby

[Hook x2]:
Tell me do you want to go home with me?
Tell me do you want to come creep with me?
Tell me do you want to get wild with me?
Tell me do you want to go home?


Tell me do you want to go home with me?
Tell me do you want to come creep with me?
Tell me do you want to get wild with me?
Tell me do you want to go home?


The dance floor is jumpin'
The music is pumpin'
I'm checkin' out your grooves
'Bout to make my moves
Across this crowded room
Cause I'm scoping you


I'm feeling confident
I just came from the bar
Sick of wondering
Who the hell you are
Cause I want you
What a Nigga gotta do

[Hook x2]:



You want to have some fun?
Come ride with me, let's chill
I'll take you to a place
And both of us get ill
Cause I'm feeling you
Just tell me what to do, baby


Take my hand lets go
That's all I want to do
Fellas wondering
How to step with you
Cause my game was tight
Everything turned out right
That night, tell me


[Hook x2]:


I'll break you off
'Til the sun comes up
Baby, come and get this thang girl
Won't tell a soul


It's down low
Trust me, I'll give you what you want baby
Let's go get freaky
Cause I'm in the mood


Get nasty, get wild on my side baby
Want to get in where I fit in baby
Baby, tell me do you want to go
