You got the game all wrong
Moving on the pain's all gone, oh
Get back to do it in the next telephone
Come up out that then bling bling in your neck lookin wrong, oh
Hair did every week
Shoes are bout five hundred dollars up on your feet, oh
Have you acting all extra
Give me this, give me that, talking real reckless
Like my name was Saint Nicholas
Santa Claus, ho ho ho, talking ridiculous
Girl you better go go go I'm getting sick of this
All you wanted was my doe I'm gettin bigger chips
Pass on singer you would never lift a finger
All you did was bop to my beats and tell me that was ?
When did you act like a wife of Betty and my girl
You was steady living in a material world oh

	[Timbaland]

Throw your hands up in the air if you feel me
Love 'em all day, love 'em all night
Don't get 'em girls roll doe

Put ya dubs up in the air if you feel me
Get 'em all day, get 'em all night

Sick of this song bout the money you spent
Boo what about the money I leant

You forget about the times I went half on your rent, no
Bailing you out of jail
Makin sure you don't forget to go and see your P-O
Piss test straight made you stop smokin dro
But you home as your ? so you could work on your flow, ho
I was your down ass bitch in the street
Brawling niggas I ain't never even flip
You had wondering eyes I ain't never even trip
Spent a couple dollars
Now you poppin fly at the lip

L-B puffs dummy you was stinkin rainbow
Quadripled a million you was thinkin lame doe
Permanent reminder you ain't dealin with no lame ho

Got a lawyer like Mr. ?
Money locked in, plus the streets watchin
