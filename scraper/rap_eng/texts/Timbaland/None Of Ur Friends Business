[Hook]
It ain't none of your friends business
It ain't none of your friends business
What we will be doing tonight
We can just hang out all night or grab a bite
It ain't none of your friends business
It ain't none of your friends business
Whether you get sexed tonight
Long as we protect ourselves and do it right
It ain't none of your friends business
It ain't none of your friends business
We can just go to the park
And lay there till after dark
At the park
It ain't none of your friends business
It ain't none of your friends business
We can just go to the movies girl
Cause tonight it's all your world
Babygirl

[Verse 1]
Tell your friends, back off of us (cause they're in our business and shit)
Cause they were the same ones, who hooked us up (but now they are jealous and shit)
Cause they see we are living, ghetto fabulous (and they just can't deal with that shit)
But I don't give a damn, long as its me you trust (cause i can't get down with your clique)

We can just go to the park
And lay there till after dark
At the park
It ain't none of your friends business
It ain't none of your friends business
We can just go to the movies girl
Cause tonight it's all your world

[Verse 2]
Put your trust in me girl, leave your friends alone (they make it hard for us and shit)
And I don't know how many guys, have done you wrong (but I dont get down with that shit)
And I don't know how many guys, who would sing a song (to show you they love you thats it)
But lets look to the future girl, cause babe its on (cause i can't get down with your clique)
