What a day
Young boy next door passed away
Ooh, it makes me wanna say
Hey, I don't wanna waste another day
Can you and I start mixing gene pools?
Eastern, western people, get naughty, multilingual
I was sort of soul searching
But your body's so jaw-dropping
Our chemistry's ground breaking
Don't keep me waiting
Hurry up baby, hurry up baby
Let me give you my love
Hurry up, let's turn this room into a melting pot
Giddy up baby, giddy up baby
Let me give you my love
Buckle up, boy, I know you're gonna like what I got
Maybe it's not worth the wait
Maybe I should walk away
Hey, I don't wanna waste my energy
Can you and I stop acting like fools
Or move on to other people?
It's funny but I'd like to settle
I was sort of like soul searching
But your body's so jaw-dropping
Some say it's rule breaking
But times are changing
Hurry up baby, hurry up baby
Let me give you my love
Hurry up, let's turn this room into a melting pot
Giddy up baby, giddy up baby
Let me give you my love
Buckle up, boy, I know you're gonna like what I got
Let me know if what I'm feeling isn't mutual
All I know is that I am feeling very, very hot, hot, hot
Hurry up baby, hurry up baby
Let me give you my love
Hurry up, let's turn this room into a melting pot
Giddy up baby, giddy up baby
Let me give you my love
Buckle up, boy, I know you're gonna like what I got
Hurry up baby, hurry up baby
Let me give you my love
Hurry up, let's turn this room into a melting pot
Giddy up baby, giddy up baby
Let me give you my love
Buckle up, boy, I know you're gonna like what I got
