Fucking pick it up, Mr. Rocket
Now hit it, yeah

I'm bringing sexyback
Them other boys don't know how to act
I think it's special, what's behind your back?
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack
Take it to the bridge

Dirty babe, you see them shackles
Baby, I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way
Take it to the chorus

Come here, girl
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Come to the back
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Vip
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Drinks on me
(Go ahead be gone with it)

Let me see what your twerkin' with
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Look at those hips
(Go ahead be gone with it)
That make me smile
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Go ahead child
(Go ahead be gone with it)

Get your sexy on
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Get your sexy on
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Get your sexy on
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Get your sexy on

I'm bringing sexyback
Them motherfuckers don't know how to act
Girl, let me make up for all the things you lack
You're burning up, I've got to get it fast
Take it to the bridge

Dirty babe, you see them shackles
Baby, I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way
Take it to the chorus

Come here, girl
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Come to the back
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Vip
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Drinks on me
(Go ahead be gone with it)

Let me see what your twerkin' with
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Look at those hips
(Go ahead be gone with it)
That make me smile
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Go 'head child
(Go ahead be gone with it)

Get your sexy on
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Get your sexy on
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Get your sexy on
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Get your sexy on

You ready, you ready

I'm bringing sexyback
You motherfuckers, watch how I attack
If that's your girl, better watch your back
'Cause you're burning up for me and that's a fact
Take it to the chorus

Come here, girl
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Come to the back
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Vip
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Drinks on me
(Go ahead be gone with it)

Let me see what your twerkin' with
(Go ahead be gone with it)
Look at those hips
(Go ahead be gone with it)
That make me smile

Go ahead child
