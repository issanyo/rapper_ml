Uh, yeah
Come on, tempo
A. Keys, let's go
Lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme

Lemme tell you somethin', tell you how I feel
When he comes around I gettin' to feelin' ill
It's a achin' feelin' inside my chest
It's like I'm goin' in to cardiac arrest

Adrenaline rushin' in my body
All my power I just can't fight it
Doesn't matter how I keep on tryin'
I can't deny I've got this
(Heartburn)
Burnin' in my soul
(Heartburn)
Call the fire department
(Heartburn)
It's out of control, oh
(Heartburn)

You got me trippin', slippin', gettin' beside myself
I tried some medication but don't nothin' help
So I said, "Doctor, Doctor, tell me will I die?"
And he said, "Count to five Alicia"
And I'm gonna be alright
Lets go one, two, three, four

Adrenaline rushin' in my body
All my power I just can't fight it
Doesn't matter how? I keep on tryin'
I can't deny I've got this
(Heartburn)
Burnin' in my soul
(Heartburn)
Call the fire department
(Heartburn)
It's out of control, oh
(Heartburn

Taste so good, I can't resist
Gettin' harder to digest
Can't take no more, gotta shake it off
Now break it down, and take it to the ground with me now

Everybody say
Ohh uh oh oh ohh
Uh oh oh oh woh
Uh oh oh uh uh oh ohh
Uh oh oh uh oh ohh
Uh oh oh ohh
Uh oh oh ohh
Uh oh oh ohh

Don't you know I got this?
(Heartburn)
Burnin' in my soul
(Heartburn)
Call the fire department
(Heartburn)
It's out of control
(Heartburn)
What you trynna do?
(Heartburn)
Burin' in my soul
(Heartburn)
Call the fire department
(Heartburn)
It's out of control
(Heartburn)

Shake it, shake it, shake it off
Shake it, shake it, shake it off
Shake it, shake it, shake it off
Shake it, shake it, shake it off
