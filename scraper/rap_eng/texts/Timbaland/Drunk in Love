[Verse 1]
I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, now-now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, now-now
Drunk in love, I want you

[Chorus]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 2]
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, now-now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, now-now
Drunk in love, I want you

[Chorus]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
