[Verse 1]
Bittersweet thing, could this be a dream
Or just the same nightmare that keeps me awake?
And I feel it in my brain, tall shot of pain
Pour a little out now for the love that we've made

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel it the morning, you're still here in the morning
I see you but you're gone, telephone the doctor, I'm not okay
The bottom of the bottle to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof don't change the truth, I dive in, but I can't

[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, I'm livin' in

[Post-Chorus]
Now tell me baby, now don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?

[Verse 2]
I got a poundin' on my brain, so I drowned it away
When the sun comes up tomorrow, you can find me doin' the same
Cause I just can't forget, the way we turned out this bad
And now the only thing that sleeps here is a ghost of you instead

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel it the morning, you're still here in the morning
I see you but you're gone, telephone the doctor, I'm not okay
The bottom of the bottle to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof don't change the truth, I dive in, but I can't

[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, I'm livin' in

[Post-Chorus]
So tell me baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak? Yeah
And tell me baby, one more time, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?

[Bridge]
Break it down
I can't drink you
No I can't drink you away
I can't drink you
I can't

[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, I'm livin' in
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, oh
