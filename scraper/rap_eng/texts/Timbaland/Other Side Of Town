[Intro]
I should've left that side of town alone
I should've left that side of the town alone
I should've left that side of town alone
A long time ago

[Verse 1]
We met at party about almost two years ago
But there was a part of me that she just didn't know
I tried to hide it from her but it didn't take long
Before she would've found me and see where I go
I wanted to tell her but I just didn't know how
And every time I'd spoke, the words just wouldn't come out
Everyone will tell you that old habits die hard
And it's just the same for me

[Pre-Chorus]
She wouldn't compromise
She'd wanna stand her ground
She wouldn't talk to me
She wouldn't make a sound
She wanna say goodbye
I wanna reconcile
What type of shit is she on?

[Chorus]
I should've left that side of town alone (oh)
I should've left that side of the town alone (oh)
I should've left that side of town alone (oh)
A long time ago
I should've left that side of town alone (oh)
I should've left that side of the town alone (oh)
I should've left that side of town alone (oh)
A long time ago

[Verse 2]
Guilty, it's getting to me but she wasn't home
Keep trying to call but she won't pick up her phone
My conscience is speaking to me but I'm in the wrong
She don't wanna talk to me, she'd rather go, go
Tried to apologize for the lies that i told
She don't wanna hear it n' told me to leave her alone
I didn't appreciate her until she was gone
And now it's too late for that

[Pre-Chorus]
She wouldn't compromise
She'd wanna stand her ground
She wouldn't talk to me
She wouldn't make a sound
She wanna say goodbye
I wanna reconcile
What type of shit is she on?

[Chorus]
I should've left that side of town alone (oh)
I should've left that side of the town alone (oh)
I should've left that side of town alone (oh)
A long time ago
I should've left that side of town alone (oh)
I should've left that side of the town alone (oh)
I should've left that side of town alone (oh)
A long time ago

[Bridge]
She won't even talk to me, no
She won't even talk to me, no
She won't even talk to me, no
She won't, she won't
She won't even talk to me, no
(She wouldn't compromise)
(She'd wanna stand her ground)
She won't even talk to me, no
(She wouldn't talk to me)
(She wouldn't make the sound)
She won't even talk to me, no
(She wanna say goodbye)
(I wanna reconcile)
She won't, she won't
(What type of shit is she on?)

[Chorus]
I should've left that side of town alone (oh)
I should've left that side of the town alone (oh)
I should've left that side of town alone (oh)
A long time ago
I should've left that side of town alone (oh)
I should've left that side of the town alone (oh)
I should've left that side of town alone (oh)
A long time ago
