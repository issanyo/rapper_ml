What’s your suggestion for the night
Should I turn off or maybe leave on the light?
Uh, electric lady (x2)

Oh my, you’re skipping my heart
Kiss in the dark with your lightning eyes
Said I want you igniting fires all night
And you got the power
You’re damn right it’s life or death
Not gonna make it if we don’t connect tonight right

Strike twice all night
Body moves like waves
You’re reaching my heart fast
You’re searching for something
That’s just how electricity behaves
Now I need it in somewhere
The others don’t last
Wait a minute I’m feeling charged
I should've known as you glow in the dark
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks
Electric lady uuh
Wait a minute, I’m to the drops
I feel it jump, we get closer will we spark
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks
Electric lady

Love won’t die
So what you’re giving me girl all
That energy giving
You know how it goes sometimes
Love won’t die
Love won’t die
But if you need it girl
I got energy come and get it
Sometimes I need to give a little
Give a little, if I get a little
And we could meet anyways about the middle tonight
And you've got the power
Baby you know if you ever go
And you’re back into the light

Strike twice all night
Body moves like waves
You’re reaching my heart fast
You’re searching for something
That’s just how electricity behaves
And I’ve been needing it so bad
The others don’t last
Wait a minute I’m feeling charged
I should’ve known as you glow in the dark
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks
Electric lady uuh
Wait a minute, I’m to the drops
I feel it on we get closer till we shock
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks
Electric lady

Wait a minute I’m feeling charged
I should’ve known as you glow in the dark
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks
Electric lady uuh
Wait a minute, I’m to the drops
I feel it on we get closer till we shock
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks
Electric lady
