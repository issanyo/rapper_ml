[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're, approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're, approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Little baby with the sun dress on
Looking so damn right you're wrong
Make me wanna write my own little song for you
The way the thing just wiggle in the air
Turn around and then you flip your hair
I could think of a couple positions for you
You're wasting no time talking to me
Must be something you want me to see
Well, baby girl, don't mind me if I do
So take the stage just show me what you got
Feeling lucky let me touch your spot
Might be leaving with me before the night is through

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're, approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Your body's saying things I ain't never heard
You did the shake-shake and I kinda went berserk
Gotta give it to you, girl, you're one of a kind
When you took my hand up so calm
Touched it to your cherry lip balm
A million nasty things went through my mind
So baby, tell me what you're doing later on
'Cause I'm thinking me and you could get along
Baby girl, don't mind me if I do
So take the stage just show me what you got
Feeling lucky let me touch your spot
Might be leaving with me before the night is through

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're, approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
Yeah, Bubba come stumblin' in
Get up, huntin "Betty" with Justin and them
We must, be the flyest of Southerner men
That's your girl, well buddy, don't fumble it then
You better get her, I'm totally into my zone
Come on girl, close your eyes pretend that your home
I will be puttin' my signature on
That thing I don't even wanna finish the song, let's go
I'm gettin discouraged with her
Too late now we're friends, I surely prefer
Listen to every word that I slur
Other dudes be huggin' and nourishin' her
Not me, I bet you remember the night
Good ol' Bubba K, came into her life
Test the water let me know if the temperature right
Thank you ma'am, its certainly been a delight, uh-huh

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
Hey, hey
So right for me
You so right for me
