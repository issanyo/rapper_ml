You're so, you just don't know
What I'd do to you
If this situation were different
[Dawn]
If we don't go (go)
We'd be on this floor, it'd be on for sure
It's too bad that we can't

[Pre-chorus - Aubrey
You make me wanna do, something I never do
Wanna go there with you
All the way there (there), touch me there, take me there with you
Boy, I'm scared of you
Nothing compares to you
Boy, I'm not prepared to do it

[Chorus - D. Woods
So I can't love you (right now)
Like I want to (right now)
We just can't do it
And it's taking everything in me
I want to (right now)
You know I want to (right now)
But it's this one rule
(And it's keeping me from giving you my love)

[Verse 2 - Dawn]
I must admit
Baby, ooh your kiss
It's taking my mind
To places that my body's never seen before
Make me want it more
[Aundrea]
I know you're hopin' that I bend a little
Give a little more (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus - D. Woods (Group)]
You make me wanna do, something I never do (never do)
Wanna go there with you (with you)
All the way there (there), touch me there (there), take me there with you (there with you)
Boy I'm scared of you
Nothing compares to you
I'm prepared to do it

[Chorus - Aubrey (Group)]
So I can't love you (right now)
Like I want to (right now)
We just can't do it
And it's taking everything in me
I want you (right now)
No I want to (right now)
But it's this one rule
(And it's keeping me from giving you my love)

[Bridge - Shannon (Dawn)]
Wanna go all the way
We gotta play it safe
Hey, Hey
We ain't doin' nothing if you don't, don't, don't, don't know (my love)
(So you just can't have my love)

[Chorus - Aundrea (Group)]
So I can't love you (right now)
Like I want to (right now)
We just can't do it
And it's taking everything in me
Know that I want to (right now)
But i can't love (right now)
I want to
(And it's keeping me from giving you my love)

[Outro - Dawn (spoken)]
Ooh right there right there
Touch me there, right there
Ooh there, there
Right there, right there
Ooh, no
Right there, right there
No, right there, right there, right there
