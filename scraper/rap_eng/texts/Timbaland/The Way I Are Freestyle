Look K to the, A to the N-O
Mellow, like I smoked an eighth of the
Chung ting, so I arrive late with her
Chung ting on my arm, that's my date for the
Night rave with her, night club like eight of us
And we shine like Mase in the
Nineties, with one of them shiny suits on
Yeah that's fire, I set the booth on
Standard, two Grey Goose and two Dom
Two brunettes, two blacks and two blondes
Huh and I get my Magaluf on
It don't make it right but yeah I'm too wrong
Girls wile out when they hear my tunes on
And new student loan, Jimmy Choo's on
I guess you can keep those on
Lift your feet up in the, air
The feelings now got making Jamelia
With a bad boy, make her a Billionaire
Boys Club tee on, that's what I spend P's on
Car full of girls, like a pocket (??)
You don't know me then turn your TV on
Look, nigga ask about me
Goons you can ask G's why the fuck I'm audi
So don't fucking doubt me, I'm raw
Top floor, Jigga next door, The Lowry
Meet downstairs at the bar, we're alcy
Shots of Patron, sending that home
I'm on the bus, 40'' TV screen
Watching a 9/11 DVD, Fuck Bush
Wait til I get my money right, I'm missing
Monty got flavour, the Red Stripe I'm sipping
Look, that's the way I are
I just spray my bars, cause I'm the best MC by far
K buy Vodka like we buy cars
Don't get it twisted like Levi's are
See me and Bio in the A-T-L
Please leave us alone by Katie Pel
See the shops stay open to make these sells
Cartier for the misses, no True Religion
A couple nice bits for the nephew and niece
Some Ed Hardy for me and I'm blessed
Now I'm set, except for the grill
I'm Double 0-7, dressed for the kill
Test me, I will show you's niggas why
I'm a survivor like them Destiny girls
I'm so out doshed it's left on the shelf
That's why I'm fresh till death, I get bills
Cause dat, dat, dat, dat, dat, dat's mine
Me and P-Money we bought the whole rail
Then brought girls back to the hotel
Nah, I'm just kidding I be writing for riddims
And the flows killing them softly like Lauren Hill
But if I ruled the world I'd free the whole jail
Except for the rapists and paedo's
I'd never come back like old key Moschino's
See though, I love black people
Cause we get cash fast and act a Jackass like Steve-O
