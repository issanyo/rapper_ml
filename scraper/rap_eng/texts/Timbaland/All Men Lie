[Intro: Timbaland]
What's his name, girl?
Was he good to you?
I need to know, girl
What I didn't do

[Verse 1: Timbaland + (Monica)]
I maybe saw you with him in the photo
Poor Shot (poor)
Now they say every man (every man)
Is a damn good liar (liar)
But it ain't worth the pain
Take it from me

[Chorus: Timbaland + (Monica)]
She said
(All men lie, men lie)
That's what she said to me
She's saying
(All men lie, men lie)
And they all will cheat, she's screaming
(All men lie, oooh)
Baby, that's the truth
I know the grass ain't always green on the other side

[Verse 2: Monica]
What happened to trust?
Boy, what happened to us?
You're doing too much
Now to make me act up
You gonna get you and her fucked up, fucked up, fucked up
See, you might play the game
But you don't play with my heart
If you were smart like you claim
You wouldn't got caught up

[Chorus: Timbaland + (Monica)]
(All men lie, men lie)
That's what she said to me
(All men lie)
She's saying
(All men lie, men lie)
(That's what she said)
And they all will cheat, she's screaming
(All men lie, oooh)
Baby, here's the truth
I know the grass ain't always green on the other side

[Bridge: Timbaland + (Monica)]
Eh
If all men lie, tell me what do women do
(That's what ya'll niggas do)
Eh
If all men lie, tell me what do women do
(That's what ya'll niggas do, do do do)
Eh
If all men lie, tell me what do women do
(Aaah)
Eh, if, eh
If all men lie, tell me what do women do
