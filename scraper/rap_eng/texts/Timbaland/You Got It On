[Intro]
(Listen...)

[Verse 1]
Now baby, the day you were born
They picked you up and wrapped you up
So cold but so hot everything melts on you
It's cool you got on nothing, baby
Cause I know what to do, girl, let's coordinate, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
First I take you out, then you turn around (Baby)
Then you back it up, ooh yeah, like we at our own place
So I take you home, wear whatever you want, baby
'Cause I know that we’re gonna end up back where we started

[Chorus]
And you don’t gotta worry what you wear tonight
Those heels lift you up where you fit me right, said oh
You already got it on, oh, baby
Tell me what's better than the two of us
'Cause you by yourself is more than enough for me
Honey, I don’t think she heard me, so I say
Oooh, baby, you got it... on
I said ooh, baby, you got it... on

[Verse 2]
Now everything you put on
Everything you put on looks better on you, than the one you tried on before
Don’t make me pick girl, don’t make me choose
Don’t you feel like you’re back in the twelfth grade
Now you're my first lady so let’s take you back to our first date
This is what we'll do...

[Pre-Chorus]
First I take you out, then you turn around (Baby)
Then you back it up, ooh yeah, like we at our own place
So I take you home, wear whatever you want, baby
'Cause I know that we’re gonna end up back where we started

[Adlib]
And what I'm saying is....

[Chorus]
And you don’t gotta worry what you wear tonight
Those heels lift you up where you fit me right, said oh
You already got it on, oh, baby
Tell me what's better than the two of us
'Cause you by yourself is more than enough for me
Honey, I don’t think she heard me, so I say
Oooh, baby, you got it... on
I said ooh, baby, you got it... on

[Bridge]
And it sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love right now
Sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love right now
It sounds like falling in love
Just like falling in love over and over again with you
Sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love right now
Sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love right now
It sounds like falling in love
Just like falling in love over and over again with you, oh baby

[Outro]
You don’t gotta worry what you wear tonight
Baby, you got it... on
Tell me what's better than the two of us... nothing!
Baby, you got it
I don’t think she heard me so I say
I say ooh, baby, you’ve got it... on
I’m telling you, mama
Ooh, baby, you’ve got it... on
Don’t matter what you wear
Baby, you’ve got it on
And it sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love
Yeah, baby, you got it on
