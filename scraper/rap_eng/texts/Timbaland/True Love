[Verse 1]
For a second, I was in control
I had it once, I lost it though
And all along the fire below
Would rise
And I wish you could have let me know
What's really going on below
I've lost you now, you let me go
But one last time

[Chorus]
Tell me you love me
If you don't, then lie
Lie to me

[Verse 2]
Remember once upon a time
When I was yours and you were blind
The fire would sparkle in your eyes
And mine

[Chorus]
So tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me
Just tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me

[Bridge]
And call it true
Call it true love
Call it true
Call it true love

[Guitar Solo]
