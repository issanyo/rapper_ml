C'mon

I need a good girl
I need a good girl
I need a good girl

[Verse I]
Eyes all chinky
She be coming through in the new Cadillac Escalade on twinkies
Ma got a perfect face, brilliant ass
Her hands and her feet look like a mill in cash
I love when I call and she still in class
Instead of down in Bloomingdales stealing bags
And you know ya man Jada shoot through the hood
She look so good that the chickenheads can't hate her
Ever seen a dime? she a hell-a one
Still make her hop out and cop me a dutch, a vanilla one
Taught her how to murda the highway
Put her up on mean shoes like Roberto Cavale`
Even though she look real ill in the Gucci
Now you might catch her in Emilio Pucci
Since she a good girl that attend college
I don't let her give me brain I just let her give me knowledge

[Hook 2X: Carl Thomas]
She's a good, good, good, good girl
Such a real fine lady and a lucky girl
I don't want no nasty girl
I don't want no nasty girl

[Verse II]
I'mma show you the Kiss of Life sorta like Sade
G-class 5, the seats go sideways
Wit the see-through roof, OOF!
Rims so big they leave dents in the highway
My good girl ride wit me
She take over the wheel everytime I pull over to piss
She shake it up in the club when I'm over them hips
Waking up to the turkey bacon over the grits
Orange juice and the newspaper over the clips
Later on she gon hook up spaghetti
She ain't worried 'bout Hermes shit she got it already
She said she knew about the game cause her father was heavy
Then she asked could she borrow the Chevy
I could zoom in the jag
She going shopping need room for the bags
I sped off in the joint like it's Raspy's world
Cause (I don't want no nasty girl}

[Hook]

[Verse III]
She's a good girl, I love her for that
She got mad dough, I love her for that
Her moms is cool, I think her lil' brother a rat
Everything else is straight though other than that
She dont play no games, I love her for that
Or hang wit no dames, I love her for that
I told her roll for dolo, leave the chicks
Attitude, reflex leadership
And the sex is incredible, I love her for that
How she fit me in her schedule, I love her for that
And she like making love by the lake for hours
Or just chillin' on the block, on a crate for hours
This Jadakiss, and Timbaland
This is Raspy's world
And I don't want no nasty girl

[Hook]
