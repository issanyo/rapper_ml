I ain't tryna be rude dude, but we tryna tear up the place, oh

[Justin] (Timbaland)
Hey Timbo (yeah)
Don't you hate it when a dude starts actin' up
Like this fella over here with his hand on his cup
Mean muggin' and carryin' on (come on)

[Timbaland] (Justin)
Hey J-T (yeah)
Why these dudes keep starin' at us
(I don't know but I'm bout to find out what's up)
Be easy, don't take it too rough, talk to 'em

[Justin]
I'm not being cocky
I just noticed that she was lookin' at me
Chill homeboy, be cool
Cause there ain't no reason for all that fussin' at me
It's just gettin' started
And there's a lotta fish around here, just shakin' that jelly

[Timbaland]
I ain't tryna be rude dude
But we tryna tear up the place, oh, come on

[Justin]
It ain't nothing to it
If you wanna get down then we can do it, do it
It ain't nothing to it
Get out your seat, why, you ain't glued to it
Get busy and watch that song
Keep steppin' with your new suede shoes on
Boys and girls, let's all sing along
Everybody just get on the good foot

[Timbaland] (Justin)
Yeah, uh, yeah (get on the good foot)
Yeah, uh, yeah, frickit

J.T = Now, how am I supposed to know
J.T = That she's yours, she ain't got no ring on her finger
Tim = It ain't our fault homeboy
Tim = That your girl likes to wander and linger
J.T = You're acting so serious
J.T = We just danced, I ain't even asked for her number
Tim = Don't be mad cause we the life of the party
Tim = And we ain't really tryna hurt nobody, talk to 'em

[Justin]
