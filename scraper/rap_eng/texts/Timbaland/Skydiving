[Intro]
La da do do do
Yeah eh eh eh

[Verse 1]
When our lips, touched that morning
I was gone, game over
Held you tight, a fleeting moment
That left me, far from sober

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So I left that played out mess behind
All that sadness and distress of mine
And we found ourselves suspended yeah
Hovering above the roof mid air

[Chorus]
This ain't no jump bumpin'
Wanna play? Skydiving
You and me
Floating on intimacy
This ain't no, one night thing
Eternal, Skydiving
You got me lifted baby
Our love is like we're skydiving
This ain't no jump bumpin'
Wanna play? Skydiving
You and me
Floating on intimacy
This ain't no, one night thing
Eternal, Skydiving
You got me lifted baby
Our love is like we're skydiving

[Verse 2]
So they say you got some chick
That keeps you warm at night along for the ride but
If you ask me that's bullshit
Because obviously heaven sent you for me no

[Pre-Chorus 2]
See they never told me about love or life
But I'm learning each moment we fly
Where we land is of no consequence
We’re in tandem, it’s beyond intense

[Chorus]
This ain't no jump bumpin'
Wanna play? Skydiving
You and me
Floating on intimacy
This ain't no, one night thing
Eternal, Skydiving
You got me lifted baby
Our love is like we're skydiving
This ain't no jump bumpin'
Wanna play? Skydiving
You and me
Floating on intimacy
This ain't no, one night thing (No, no)
Eternal, Skydiving
You got me lifted baby
Our love is like we're skydiving

[Bridge]
Lifted baby (Baby)
Got me lifted baby (Baby)
Boy you got me lifted baby (Baby, baby)
All I really want is your intimacy (Baby, baby)

[Outro]
This ain't no jump bumpin'
Wanna play? Skydiving (Skydiving, skydiving, skydiving, skydiving)
This ain't no, one night thing
Eternal, Skydiving
All I really want is your intimacy
