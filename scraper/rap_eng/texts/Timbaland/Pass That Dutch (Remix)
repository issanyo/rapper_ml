[Intro]
Listen up everyone! we have been just informed
That there's an unknown virus that's attacking all clubs
Symptoms have been said to be - heaving breathing
Wild dancing, coughing
So when you hear the sound - who-di-whoooo!
Run for cover motherfucker!
Woooooo! Ahh daddy! Ooooo! Ah! oh, ooh!
Pass that dutch (ah), pass that dutch (ooh)
Pass that dutch (ah), pass that dutch (ah)
Pass that dutch (ah), pass that dutch (ah)
Pass that dutch (whoo), pass that dutch

[Verse - 1]
Misdemeanor on the flow, pretty boy here I come
Pumps and a bump make you wanna hurt something
I can take your man I don't have to sex em
Hang em out the window, call me Michael Jackson (hehehee!)
I'm a pain in your rectum, I am that bitch y'all slept on
Heavy hitter, rhyme spitter, call me Re-Run
Hey hey hey, I'm what's happ'nin
Hypnotiq in my drink (thatâ€™s right!)
Shake ya ass till it stink (that's right!)
Mr. Mos' on the beat (that's right!)
Put it down for the streets (that's right!)

[Hook]
(Who-di-whooooooooooooo!)
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Come on pass the dutch baby! (ahh!)
Shake-shake shake ya stuff ladies!
(Who-di-whooooooooooooo!)
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat (ahh!)
Don't stop, get it till ya clothes get wet

[Verse - 2]
Number one - drums go bump, bump, bump
This beat here will make your pum pum jump
If you's a fat one, put your clothes back on
Before you start putting pot holes in my lawn
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
I'm under attack like my name was Saddam
I am the bomb from New York to Milan
And I can write a song sicker than Jeffrey Dahm'
(Woop woop!) Don't touch my car alarm
Break in my car you will hear "Viper Armed"
I've been a superstar since Daddy Kane was raw
I'm live on stage, c'mon and give me some applause
"Thank you! oh thank you, you all are so wonderful!"

[Hook]
(Who-di-whooooooooooooo!)
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Come on pass the dutch baby! (ahh!)
Shake-shake shake ya stuff ladies!
(Who-di-whooooooooooooo!)
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat (ahh!)
Don't stop, get it till ya clothes get wet

[Interlude]
Listen up motherfuckers
You have five seconds to catch your breath
Five - four - three - two - one

[Busta]
It would be my pleasure
If you just let me knock they ass out for you baby
Let's go!
It's the immaculate, incredible
Magnificent, unforgettable, unimaginable
So that's such a dramatical situation
See all the shit you be facin'
While I be in the place
In a way that be keeping the party shaking (oh)
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut four, hut
Get that thong, shorty, pull it out your butt (what)
See a crew of the baddest bitches laying the cut (what)
If you ain't saying shit for, we keep your mouth shut
What, shut, what, shut, what, keep your mouth shut
I brought a couple shorties back and they cleaning my house up
Almost forgot to mention I'm one of the most important
And relevant in the street like a genius who speak intelligent, ah
Look at all of the shades of my diamonds in my bezzle
When light hits, forget it, I court a charge of embezzlement
Missy, give it to 'em, let's take 'em all on a ride
Just remember to pass the dutch on the left hand side

[Missy]
Whooo
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, come on pass the dutch baby
Shake, shake, shake your stuff ladies
Whooo
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat
Don't stop, get it till your clothes get wet

[Missy]
Pop that, pop that, make that money
Just keep it going like the Energizer bunny
Shake that, shake that, move it all around
Spank that, yank that dutch back now
Freak him, freak her, whatever your choice
Didn't come to judge, I came to get you moist
Scream (whoo whoo!) now my voice is lost
Can I get a ride on a white horse *horse*

[Missy]
Whooo
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, come on pass the dutch baby
Shake, shake, shake your stuff, ladies
Whooo
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat
Don't stop, get it till your clothes get wet

[Missy]
Pop that, pass the dutch baby, jiggle that fat
