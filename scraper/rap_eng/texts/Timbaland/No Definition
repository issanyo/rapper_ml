I'm not your man
We're more than friends
We make love but I don't call you my lover
I do for you, you do for me
It works because we don't smother each other
Its short and sweet, the time we spend
We can't take a second of it for granted (No)
I barely understand it
It's not the way I planned it the way I planned it
Why can't it just be what it is?

(Whats in a name) if we got what we need
Ain't nobody coming between us but we
Everything I told you about my love I mean
(I said) Everything that I said I mean

Actions speak louder than words
Baby, I'm gonna treat you the way you deserve
We don't need we don't need de-fini-tion
We don't need de-fini-tion
What I feel is real and if you look that up
On top of the word you see picture of us
We don't need, we don't need de-fini-tion
We don't need de-fini-tion

We shop, we dine, spend cuddle time
Come over but only on invitation
Not now, in time, we're border line
I like you but don't quit your occupation
My heart, my ace but just in case
Lets stay open to other situations
Why tell you we gonna be more
Keep you on a leash for
I don't wanna string you along, girl

We don't need, we don't need de-fini-tion

Girl
Even though we used to the titles and getting made
But maybe this time we should just leave this one alone
(Cause) if this working for us, then its working for us
Don't Go messing it up (Don't go messing it up)
