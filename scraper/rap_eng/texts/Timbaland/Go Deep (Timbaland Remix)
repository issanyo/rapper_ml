[Hook - Missy Elliott and Janet]
Go deep
No sleep
All night
Go deep
Repeat
Go deep
Real deep
Go deep

[Verse 1 - Janet]
I'm feeling fine cause in time I'll be out tonight
I'm starting now making sure I look fine tonight
Call Rene and Boo gotta meet them soon
Tell T to call Shawn
I'll be there at one
When we show up
All the guys at the club
Wanna get our backs

[Hook - Missy Elliott and Janet] [x2]
Go deep
No sleep
All night
Go deep
Repeat
Go deep
Real deep
Go deep

[Verse 2 - Janet]
I'm feeling high cause I'm outta control tonight
(Feeling high don't wanna stop)
Ooh he's got me moving
DJ grooving I feel way right
(Grooving I don't wanna stop)
I'm getting freaked from behind
I don't even mind
Cause he's looking damn fine
Make him mine in time
Gotta take him home
When I get him all alone
I'll make him scream and moan (moan)

[Hook - Missy Elliott and Janet] [x2]
Go deep
No sleep
All night
Go deep
Repeat
Go deep
Real deep
Go deep

[Chorus - Janet]
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until

[Bridge - Janet]
I'm feeling high tonight
Outta control tonight
I'm feeling high tonight
I feel high

[Verse 3 - Missy Elliott]
Yeah
I can go deeper than the river
Timbaland
Make a beat that will shiver
The back of your cars
The back of your jeeps (what)
The tip of your neck
The soles on your feet (what)
Black
My ha-hat-rat-tat (uh)
Tat-tat-tat
Now duplicate that (what)
You sound wack
Here's a smack
Janet don't play that
Timbaland give me playback

[Hook - Missy Elliott and Janet] [x3]
Go deep
No sleep
All night
Go deep
Repeat
Go deep
Real deep
Go deep
