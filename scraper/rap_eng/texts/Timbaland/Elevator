[Intro: Timbaland]
Hey girl, ya comin' with me, ya comin' with me...
Hey girl, ya comin' with me, ya comin' with me...
Hey girl, ya comin' with me, ya comin' with me...
Hey girl, ya comin'... c'mon
Talk to me girl, give it to me
Got you stuck
On my elevator
Get it up
On my uh-ohh, uh-ohh, oh-ohh

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Heyyyy!
My first flo' stuck on a gold diggin' woman
Money cash flow, all big face hunneds
Stuntin' on the pole, got them D-boys runnin'
Shorty got both broke, can't see what's comin'
Wear them apple bottoms, wear them apple bottoms honey
Dolce and Gabbana, and she get it from her mommy
Louis bag kit, Gucci, Fendi and Armani
See them karats on her wrist, now she pimp Bugs Bunny
Used to date Kanye, now she want me
Flo Rida got the juice, wanna take my OJ
It ain't her birthday but her name on the cake
If I ever pay for nookie grade A

[Hook: Timbaland]
Got you stuck (yeah) on my elevator (uh-huh)
Get it up (yeah) on my elevator - check it out!
My first flo', stuck on the golddigger
Second flo', stuck on the dimepiece
Third flo', stuck on the hoodrat
Fourth flo' - freak it, I don't know cause
This girl is/she's stuck on my ele, eh-el-eh-vator (frikki frikki)
This girl is/she's stuck on my ele, eh-el-eh-vator (frikki frikki)
This girl is/she's stuck on my ele, eh-el-eh-vator (frikki frikki)
This girl is/she stuck on my oww oww oww oww

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
She got her nails did, she got her hair did
She got a Gucci bag, her brand new outfit
Stuck on my elevator, she on the second flo'
Now I want you to break it down, DJ turn it up some mo'
Hey!
Dimepiece girl [trippin' internet?] hottie
Little momma strut that Top Model body
South Beach peach on the back of that Ducati
I'll bet you that brand new Ferrari

[Hook: Timbaland]
Got you stuck (yeah) on my elevator (uh-huh)
Get it up (yeah) on my elevator - check it out!
My first flo', stuck on the golddigger
Second flo', stuck on the dimepiece
Third flo', stuck on the hoodrat

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
Hey!
My third flo' stuck on the hoodrat shone
Cut, take one, Hollyhood act on
Short tennis skirt, now she got me in the zone
Tattoo tight work, bought the "Low" ringtone
Plenty ghetto booty, plenty ghetto booty on her
Roll up with kitties, don't smoke Arizona
One night stand, one night with the clan
One night, one time broke her off ten grand
Project all the way, gutter all day
Pure uncut, stain wall with a J
Shorty don't fake, she'll put it in your face
Three stories by them hoodrat's [bay?]
