[Verse 1]
"Pick a card, any card"
That's what he told me
I took it to Rodeo and it worked like magic for me
Spa and massage, I'm at the Bullag
His and her's, flying spurs
Automatical rush

[Pre-Chorus]
Shoot, and I'm charming, gold charm on the chain
Don't hate me, hate the game (Baby, na, na, na, na)
I can wave my wand and like that
Now we all alone

[Chorus]
Just like that, you're mine
Like magic, magic, magic
With just one blink of an eye
Like magic, magic, magic
I know I caught you by surprise
Like magic, magic, magic
Won't be the same after tonight
Like magic, magic, magic
Like magic
Baby, na, na, na, na

[Verse 2]
Now you see, now you don't
I got this trick to show ya
Disappear when he act up on ya
'Fore you know, he'll be alright up on ya
Juicy coutures and Nanete Lepores
Turning back, slow the 'vete
Valet lift up the door

[Pre-Chorus]
Shoot, and I'm charming, gold charm on the chain
Don't hate me, hate the game (Baby, na, na, na, na)
I can wave my wand and like that
Now we all alone

[Chorus]
Just like that, you're mine
Like magic, magic, magic
With just one blink of an eye
Like magic, magic, magic
I know I caught you by surprise
Like magic, magic, magic
Won't be the same after tonight
Like magic, magic, magic
Just like that, you're mine
Like magic, magic, magic
With just one blink of an eye
Like magic, magic, magic
I know I caught you by surprise
Like magic, magic, magic
Won't be the same after tonight
Like magic, magic, magic
Baby, na, na, na, na
Baby, na, na, na, na

[Bridge]
Abracadabra, I've got to have ya
He don't realize what we're doin'
Hypnotized by illusions in the club
Abracadabra, I've got to have ya
Stress your eyes, pay attention
Blow your mind when I get you out the club
Gonna wave my hand tonight
Make him my man tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Shoot, and I'm charming, gold charm on the chain
Don't hate me, hate the game (Baby, na, na, na, na)
I can wave my wand and like that
Now we all alone

[Chorus]
Just like that, you're mine
Like magic, magic, magic
With just one blink of an eye
Like magic, magic, magic
I know I caught you by surprise
Like magic magic magic
Won't be the same outfit tonite
Like magic magic magic
Just like that, you're mine
Like magic, magic, magic
With just one blink of an eye
Like magic, magic, magic
I know I caught you by surprise
Like magic, magic, magic
Won't be the same outfit tonite
Like magic, magic, magic
Like magic

[Outro]
Baby, na, na, na, na
Baby, na, na, na, na
