[Chorus: JoJo & Timbaland]
Talkin' 'bout my baby; cause we always breakin' the mold
Talkin' 'bout my baby; we don't need no secret code
The way you love me down got me goin' around
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control
The way you love me down got me goin' around
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control
The way you love me, yeah, yeah
The way you love me, yeah, yeah
The way you love me, yeah, yeah
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control

[Verse 1: Timbaland & JoJo]
Hey lady, I know it gets hard sometimes
Hey lady, you been gettin' what you want from me
Hey lady, my love is always on the grind
Hey lady, how far I gotta go, to reach you?
You're all mine, you're alright, I don't mind, no, woah
When I stand, by your side, ohh!

[Chorus: JoJo & Timbaland]
Talkin' 'bout my baby; cause we always breakin' the mold
Talkin' 'bout my baby; we don't need no secret code
The way you love me down got me goin' around
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control
The way you love me down got me goin' around
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control
The way you love me, yeah, yeah
The way you love me, yeah, yeah
The way you love me, yeah, yeah
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control

[Verse 2: JoJo]
I have a bad day, I don't act right
Get up under your skin, I know it ain't right
How I ask you, to give up everything
Boy, just stop what you're doin' and come and follow me
Around - baby thank you for the second chances
And everything you did to help advance this
You put up with my shit, helped me with my biz
Boy, you really got it goin' on yeahh!
You're all mine, you're alright, I don't mind, no, woah
When I stand, by your side, ohhhhh!

[Chorus: JoJo & Timbaland]
Talkin' 'bout my baby; cause we always breakin' the mold
Talkin' 'bout my baby; we don't need no secret code
The way you love me down got me goin' around
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control
The way you love me down got me goin' around
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control
The way you love me, yeah, yeah
The way you love me, yeah, yeah
The way you love me, yeah, yeah
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control

[Bridge: Uncredited rapper]
You know my girl get the keys with the M's on it
She have the Range night, then a Benz mornin'
Bought plenty of ice for them shinin' on your friends moments
I'll give her anything she want if it look good on her
And we be chillin' like a bottle sittin' on the rocks
Shoppin' bags full of Cartier forget-me-nots
But money can't buy you love, baby that's a fact
But you can rent some love, with a couple stacks
Man I ain't gotta lease nothin I own one
And everytime I hit she say it's a home run
When asked how can we be serious at so young?
I just say I'm in it for the long run

[Chorus: JoJo & Timbaland]
Talkin' 'bout my baby; cause we always breakin the mold
Talkin' 'bout my baby; we don't need no secret code
The way you love me down got me goin' around
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control
The way you love me down got me goin' around
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control
The way you love me, yeah, yeah
The way you love me, yeah, yeah
The way you love me, yeah, yeah
I think, I think, I think I'm losin' control

[Outro: Timbaland]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
