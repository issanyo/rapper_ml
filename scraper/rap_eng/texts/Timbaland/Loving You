[Verse 1]
Hello August moon, where are the stars of the night
You promised me too soon cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said, if you're not well stay in bed
And I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed

[Hook 1]
But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

[Verse 2]
Hello midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of you until the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish and then we'll kiss, our love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

[Hook 2]
And I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

[Bridge]
It seems you don't know, we reached the higher mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together we will fly, we'll dance up in the heavens
I can really feel it when you're near, ooh

And the weatherman said, if you're not well stay in bed
Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed

[Outro]
But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
Loving you, that's what I want to do
Loving you, that's what I want to do
Loving you, that's what I want to do (doot doot doo... I'll be loving you)
Loving you, that's what I want to do (Cause you're always on my mind)
Loving you, that's what I want to do (doot doot doo... loving you)
Loving you, that's what I want to do (Always on my mind)
Loving you, that's what I want to do (That's what I want to do)
Loving you, that's what I want to do (That's what I want to do)
