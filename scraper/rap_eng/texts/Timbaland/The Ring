Your hands on the steering wheel, and it's steering me wrong
Can't you feel me here, you know you need to come home
You keep looking at me, but your keeping me on
Perfect fit but I'm starting to slip, and I hope my grip is strong enough because
You love me, you know it, don't do this, don't blow it

Can't you see my life is on your hand
You got me wrapped around your finger
If I'm your woman then be a man
Please don't take me off
Your gonna lose my love

Now I'm feeling outta place, how'd I end up in your pocket
I must have been in the way, of you keeping your promise
Shes running her hand across your chest, and touching the t-shirt that I brought
I know she feels me close to your heart, and you just play it off

You know that you love me
You love me, you know it, don't do this, don't blow it
Can't you see my life is on your hand, you got me wrapped around your finger

If I'm your woman then be a man, please don't take me off, your gonna lose my love
Please don't make the biggest mistake of your life
If you care for me then how come our loves on the line
So don't let five minutes undo your commitment
You made to me when you said I do. I do
Can't you see my life is on your hand, you got me wrapped around your finger
If I'm your woman then be a man, please don't take me off, your gonna lose my love
Can't you see my life is on your hand, you got me wrapped around your finger
If I'm your woman then be a man, please don't take me off, your gonna lose my love
Can't you see my life is on your hand, you got me wrapped around your finger
If I'm your woman then be a man, please don't take me off, your gonna lose my love
