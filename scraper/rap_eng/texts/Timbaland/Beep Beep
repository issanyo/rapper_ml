I be that man they call Timbaland
On these funky beats do you hear him?
Uh-huh, Uh-huh
Now
How many people want to, huh
Learn this method I have with these beats?
Uh-huh, Uh-huh
Now
How many songs I'm gonna hear on the radio that sound like mine?
Now, to have a partna as well as my friend
Well I have two partnas as well as my friend
And on goes by the name of....
Maganoo aka Magoo word
You know what I'm saying?  I'm putting this man down
Cause he got it like that, don't bite him
And of course Missy Elliott
We put it down like that for the 9-7
This is my dialogue on this album
It's Magoo's album featuring me, Timbaland
Cause he's so ill, I can't even rap over it
Magoo can rap over it, but I can let him rap over it
Cause I got my man Jimmie D
On that engineer board
And we do this like everyday, all day 24 hours
You know what I'm saying making this money
I ain't got to rap,all i got to do is talk on this track
And you will still buy it, you know what I'm sayin?
It's like that
So Missy tell em what I'm gonna say
