[Verse 1]
I once had no fears
None at all
And then when
I had some
To my surprise
I grew to like both
Scared or brave
Without them

[Pre-Chorus]
The thrill of fear
Thought I'd never admit it
The thrill of fear
Now greatly enjoyed with courage

[Chorus]
When I once was
Untouchable
Innocence roared
Still amazes
When I once was
Innocent
It is still here
But in different places

[Verse 2]
Neurosis
Only
Attaches
Itself to
Fertile
Ground
Where it can flourish

[Pre-Chorus]
The thrill of fear
Thought I’d never admit it
The thrill of fear
Now greatly enjoyed with courage

[Chorus]
When I once was
Fearless
Innocence roared
Still amazes
Untouchable
Innocence
It is still here
But in different places

[Bridge]
Fear is a powerful drug
Overcome it and
You think that you can do
Anything
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)

[Verse 3]
Should I
Save myself
For later
Or generously give?

[Verse 4]
Fear of
Losing
Energy
Is draining
It locks up your chest
Shuts down the heart
Miserly
And stingy
Let's open up: share!

[Chorus]
When I once was
Fearless
Innocence roared
Still amazes
Untouchable
Innocence
It is still here
But in different places
