[Intro: Timbaland]
Mr. JT, now what you got for me?
Mr. JT, now what you got for me?
Mr. JT, now what you got for me?
Mr. JT, now what you got, what you got?
Mr. JT, now what you got for me?
Mr. JT, now what you got for me?
Mr. JT, now what you got for me?
Mr. JT, now what you got?

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
You're sneaky
From the corner of my eye, I saw you eyeing me
I know that you're watching
Tell me
What would you do if I encouraged you to get next to me
When nobody's watching?

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
The way your body keeps moving
Is something that makes me weak
Let's start our own little secrets
For just you and me to keep
Too late to come off shy now
You've already gone this far
So baby, make your move, take charge
Show me what you got for me

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands (your hands), rubbing on me?
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands (your hands), feeling on me?
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands (your hands), rubbing on me?
If so (Girl)
If that's your hands (your hands), then tell me what you got for me

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, I can tell that you want to do more
Than just dance with me
And I don't mind you flirting
But honestly
Do you really wanna spend the whole night passing looks at me?
(Looks at me)
Come over here and get to working

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
The way your body keeps moving
Is something that makes me weak (Makes me weak)
Let's start our own little secrets (Yeah)
For just you and me to keep (Us to keep)
Too late to come off shy now
You've already gone this far
So baby, make your move, take charge (Oooh)
Show me what you got for me

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands (your hands), rubbing on me?
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands (your hands), feeling on me?
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands (your hands), rubbing on me?
If so (Girl)
If that's your hands (your hands), then tell me what you got for me

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(What you got?)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(What you got?)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(What you got)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge 2: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands (your hands), rubbing on me?
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands (your hands), feeling on me?
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands (your hands), rubbing on me?
If so (Girl)
If that's your hands (your hands), then tell me what you got for me
Oh, oh, oh, oh... (What you got?)

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
Oh no...
Your hands
Feeling on me
Oh no...
Your hands
Rubbing on me
Le, do, do, do, do...
