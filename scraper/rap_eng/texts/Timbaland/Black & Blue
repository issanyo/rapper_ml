[Chorus]
What are we fighting for for? Ah, ah
What are we fighting for for? Ah, ah
Why can't we make love, not war?
You beat my heart in two, you
Made it black and blue
Black and blue
Made it black and blue
Black and blue

[Verse]
Never thought our love, would turn domestic
I've finally had enough, I won't accept it
I can't let you put your hands on me
Be damned if I turn, the other cheek

[Chorus]
What are we fighting for for? Ah, ah
What are we fighting for for? Ah, ah
Why can't we make love, not war?
You beat my heart in two, you
Made it black and blue
Black and blue
Made it black and blue
Black and blue

[Bridge]
All our sticks and stones, finally turned into muck
Now we have to go, and cover up another scar
We did more damage, than we had (go and save yourself)
One of us goin' end up in jail
And it won't be me

So what are we (fighting for)?
What are we, what are we
What are we

[Chorus]
So what are we (fighting for)?
What are we, what are we
What are we

What are we fighting for for? Ah, ah
Why can't we make love, not war?
You beat my heart in two, you
Made it black and blue
Black and blue
Made it black and blue
Black and blue
