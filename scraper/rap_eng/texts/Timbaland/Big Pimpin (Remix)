[Intro: DJ RellyRell and Dessy Hinds]
DJ RellyRell: AH SHIT
Dessy Hinds: Yeah
DJ RellyRell: You know what the fuck this is, DJ RellyRell
Dessy Hinds: Oh yeah
DJ RellyRell: My nigga Dessy Hinds
Dessy Hinds: You know your boy had to talk that shit
DJ RellyRell: Talk that shit
Dessy Hinds: Uh, yeah, Nigga should have waited 'til it's summer time to drop this shit on a nigga
DJ RellyRell: Nah, fuck that, we let this go now nigga
Dessy Hinds: Hahaha, yeah, and she gon' call a nigga up on the phone after this
Dessy Hinds: Yeah
DJ RellyRell: Talk to 'em nigga!

[Verse: Dessy Hinds]
You know I see 'em, freak 'em, weave 'em, leave 'em
Cause Dess don't need 'em (right)
If they looking good, bring 'em to my hood
But keep 'em chiefing high
Roll up in a hooptie, while my hand on her thigh, keep a hand on her booty
Pop it off like a toolie
If they call me "Dessy Daddy", let 'em play with the jewlery
I was with my nigga Dully
On the same old block with the same old cutie
Got head like she knew me
Cause I never knock 'em up like a jab when I do beat
In the cut with some Indians
Some nice trinny girls with the splendid yams
Tell her friends to send it like a telegram
Then tell your mans I'm already in the fam, uh
Big P-I-M-P, I-N my energy, that's right
Give me my ten feet, they don't get my energy, that's right
Give me my hennessy
I got beef with my enemies, that's right
If she freak randomly, then she got to be a fan of me, that's right
Give me my hennessy, for my team the supremacy, that's right
Next year I turn twenty three, the beginning of the legacy, that's right
All I need is some hennessy, all I need is that hennessy, right right
And bad bitches rolling plenty weed, and bad bitches rolling plenty weed, uh

[Bridge: Dessy Hinds]
Nigga you don't have the same goals, we don't fuck with the same hoes no
Nigga you don't have the same goals, we don't fuck with the same hoes, nigga
Nigga we ain't got the same goals, we don't fuck with the same hoes, nigga
Nigga you don't have the same goals, we don't fuck with the same hoes, no
