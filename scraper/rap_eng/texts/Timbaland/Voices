[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Who is the master? Who is the slave?

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Treat me like a curse, then tell me I'm your savior
I'm never with the stranger I used to know so well
Waiting for your answer is a kind of torture
Could I grow accustomed to this kind of hell?

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Are you walking the dog? 'Cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control, is that dog walking you?
Haven't you had enough? Now your time is up
Baby, show me your hand

[Chorus: Madonna]
Voices start to ring in your head
Tell me, what do they say?
Distant echoes from another time start to creep in your brain
So you play madness like it's convenient
You do it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons, so nobody can blame you
But who is the master and who is the slave?

[Verse 2: Madonna]
First you say you love me, then you want to leave me
Then you say you're sorry, you play the game so well
I want your illusion, you're the greatest salesman
How could I refuse you when you sold it to yourself?

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Are you walking the dog? Cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control, is that dog walking you?
Haven't you had enough? Now your time is up
Baby, show me your hand

[Chorus: Madonna]
Voices start to ring in your head
Tell me, what do they say?
Distant echoes from another time start to creep in your brain
So you play madness like it's convenient
You do it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons, so nobody can blame you
But who is the master and who is the slave?
