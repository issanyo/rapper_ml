Ain't another woman that could take your spot my love

[Verse 1]
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me
(What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular?
(Tell me would you?)
Well baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl
(Like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you
(Say I do)

[Chorus]
Because I could see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our clothes in the sand
I could see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass layin' side by side
You could be my baby
When I look at my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See all I want you to do is be
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, love
My love, my love

[Verse 2]
Now if I wrote you a love note
And made you sign up every word I wrote
(What would you do?)
Would that make you want to change your scene
And want to be the one on my team?
(Tell me would you?)
See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
Cause girl, I never been more sure
(That baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for
(Just say it, I do)

[Chorus]
Because I could see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our clothes in the sand
I could see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass layin' side by side
You could be my baby
When I look at my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See all I want you to do is be
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, love
My love, my love

My love
I could see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our clothes in the sand
I could see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass layin' side by side
You could be my baby
When I look at my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See all I want you to do is be

My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love
