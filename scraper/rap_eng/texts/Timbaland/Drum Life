[Intro]
It's not hard living inside of a drum
It's nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Let's live our lives on the inside of a drum
And, and, and...

[Verse 1]
It was your eyes that gave you up through that stupid disguise
You tryin' to hide behind your drink and you almost slipped by
I see you there, sophisticated, ignoring the beat
Mouth might be closed, but listen baby, your heart, it is screaming

[Pre-Chorus]
You're one of us
One of those beautiful fools, you are
You're one of us
You were born in this song
So you should live in it

[Chorus]
Live in a drum, whoa
You'll never be in it alone
If you lived in a drum, whoa
Right now, you'd already be home
Live on, live on
The drum life never gets old
Live on, live on
The drum life keeps going on

[Verse 2]
It was a lie when they told you you were stuck here forever
They're all alone, the music's begging to bring us together
You've been away and now you won't dance
It's the only way back to your homeland

[Pre-Chorus]
You're one of us
One of those beautiful fools, you are
You're one of us
You were born in this song
So you should live in it

[Chorus]
Live in a drum, whoa
You'll never be in it alone
If you lived in a drum, whoa
Right now, you'd already be home
Live on, live on
The drum life never gets old
Live on, live on
The drum life keeps going on

[Bridge]
It's not hard living inside of a drum
It's nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Let's live our lives on the inside of a drum
And, and, and...
It's not hard living inside of a drum
It's nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Let's live our lives on the inside of a drum
And, and, and...

[Chorus]
Live in a drum, whoa
You'll never be in it alone
If you lived in a drum, whoa
Right now, you'd already be home
Live on, live on
The drum life never gets old
Live on, live on
The drum life keeps going on
