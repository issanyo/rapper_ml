[Intro: Jay Z]
Clap for a nigga with his rapping ass
Blow a stack for your niggas with your trapping ass
Clap for a nigga with his rapping ass
Blow a stack for your niggas with your trapping ass
Tom Ford, Tom Ford, Tom Ford

[Bridge: Jay Z]
Coming up, coming down
Riding clean fix your hair in my Crown
Bad bitch, H town
Keep it trill, y'all know y'all can't fuck around

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Paris where we been, pard' my Parisian
It's Hov time in no time, it's fuck all y'all season
Piss Bordeaux and Burgundies, flush out a Riesling
When Hov's out, them hoes out, y'all put y'all weaves in
Clap for a nigga with his rapping ass
Blow a stack for your niggas with your trapping ass
Spent all my euros on tuxes and weird clothes
I party with weirdoes, yeah Hov, yeah Hov

[Hook: Jay Z]
I don't pop molly, I rock Tom Ford
International, bring back the Concorde
Numbers don't lie, check the scoreboard
Tom Ford, Tom Ford, Tom Ford

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Hands down got the best flow, sound I'm so special
Sound boy burial, this my Wayne Perry flow
Y'all know nothing 'bout Wayne Perry though
District of Columbia, guns on y'all Tumblrs
Fuck hashtags and retweets, nigga
140 characters in these streets, nigga
Pardon my laughing, y'all only flagging on beats, nigga
Pardon my laughing, I happen to think you sweet

[Hook: Jay Z]
I don't pop molly, I rock Tom Ford
International, bring back the Concorde
Numbers don't lie, check the scoreboard
Tom Ford, Tom Ford, Tom Ford

[Interlude: Beyonce]
Oh, man, so throwed

[Bridge: Jay Z]
Coming up, coming down
Riding clean fix your hair in my Crown
Bad bitch, H town
Keep it trill, y'all know y'all can't fuck around
Hold up (I don't pop molly, I rock Tom Ford)

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Keep your foot off in they ass is what Ken told me
Niggas like to play games cause they feel like they know me
You don't know me nigga, I've done changed
So don't be tryna put no shit off in the game
This ain't no mothafuckin' '91
We out here rapping for money, you niggas rapping for fun
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun
Deal give me a million, you gotta give that nigga one
You can try me if you want to bitch
But I'mma show you what the fuck I'm working with
His man's tied, pistol popper you ain't real
Just cause you born in Port Arthur don't make a nigga trill
Y'all hit a lick and that bitch run you
Need to put that ho in check, that's what a real nigga do
A bitch pussy ain't shit to me
And you ain't getting no respect if you fucking for free

[Hook: Jay Z]
I don't pop molly, I rock Tom Ford
International, bring back the Concorde
Numbers don't lie, check the scoreboard
Tom Ford, Tom Ford, Tom Ford

[Bridge: Jay Z]
Coming up, coming down
Riding clean fix your hair in my Crown
Bad bitch, H town
Keep it trill, y'all know y'all can't fuck around

[Outro: Jay Z]
