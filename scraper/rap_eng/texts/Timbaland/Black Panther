[Intro]
Si mi nuh, yo

[Verse]
It's the L.L., brr, shots with a bally
I wish a gyal wood, no chalet
Trust I got the keys like a valet, heat like Miami
Free throw on 'em, Dwayne Wade on the gyally
Um, that's a 3-second violation
Airball and my team stay annihilating
Trust, so I really don't know why ya hating
'Cause you copy so much, you'd think we're Siamese twins
Look, feel me nuh, all them other gyal, dem are regular
Hear me nuh? On the radio or a video
Si mi nuh? All these likkle gyal better simmer down
Inferior, she ain't the real ting, I'm the original
Hit it up, he want the Kitty Kat, make him break it down
Tippy-toe, ride it like a horse, tell her "giddy-up"
Benover, gyal ah tear it up, gyal ah rip it up
Go deh gyal, look nuh, gyal ah catch Chlamydia
Dutty gyal, tell a gutter gyal leave the area
Stutter gyal, eye ah flutter gyal, mi nuh 'fraid ah ya
Dig you out the grave I put you in and rebury ya
That's the only time you'll be all over social media
Banter, what you rep for? What you stand for?
I be at your door like a delivery from Asda
Hamper, blacking out, looking like a panther
I will backhand her straight to Wakanda
Rasta, I will blast her, mi ah di master
Casper, mi duppy down, gyal the body snatcher
Dashed her in a trash-bag, come and grab that
Bad gyal vers' a dead gyal is a disaster
Actor, cut the chapter, mi didn't cast her
Fracture, put the gas up in Madagascar
Scratch that, give 'em airtime, when I'm here they like
"Asthma! I got asthma! I got asthma!"
Killing all a dem becah mi no seh mi bad
Quick tings and never slowly, don't have to lie to be cozy
Holy moly, I'll spin a gyal quicker than roly-poly
All and only, I'm bigger than him and her and totally
On the ball like Kobe, they taking shots, well, I'm the goalie
All your team is phony, I think you know it, I know you know it
And you low on money, you gon' need mo', you finding Dory
"What's the story" like an episode of Balamory, ayy

[Chorus]
They don't wanna mess becah mi cold, yeah, mi real-la-la
Everybody knows I got the flow and the skill-la-la
Man are even hating on the girl, better chill-la-la
Man are even hating on the girl, seen
They don't wanna mess becah mi cold, yeah, mi real-la-la
Everybody knows I got the flow and the skill-la-la
Man are even hating on the girl, better chill-la-la
Man are even hating on the girl, seen

[Outro]
Wakanda forever
Wakanda forever
Wakanda forever
Wakanda forever
Wakanda forever
Wakanda forever
Wakanda forever
Wakanda forever
