Huh, huh.. ohhh..

I met him in the Bahamas, I love that nigga per-sona
Smoke that nigga marijuana, get freaky call me Madonna
Lay on the bed he follow, bone him until to-morrah
Make him sing high sopran-ah, AHHHHHHHH!!
Fifty-fo'-fifty-fifty, Mr. Act-Super-Kinky
Baby what you gon' get me, is some rings for my lil' pinkie
Money will multiply, 'fore you run up inside
Make me all weak and tired, mmhmmm..

[Chorus: Timbaland + Missy]
You got ta.. (scream)
If you up in the club, you think you tearin it up
You got ta, got ta.. (scream)
Well pour most of the liquor, then you watchin people buzz
You got ta, got ta.. (scream)
If you from out of town, you think you're holdin it down
You got ta, got ta.. (scream)
You got ta.. you got ta..

[Missy]
He say he from Puerto Rico, he told me to call him Chico
Freakin up in the Nico, my ego got really negro
Throw the heat throw heat be bold, though I'm like dice in cee-lo
Makin heads scream and moan, AHHHHH!!! Send 'em back home
Boy is really worth it, just to get dirty dirty
Give me that liquor liquor, make me talk slurry slurry
Money will multiply, 'fore you run up inside
Get me all weak and tired, mmhmmm..

[Chorus]

[Missy]
He asked could he rock my body, he also asked could he buy me
A drink six-oh Ferrari, then ride up in my safari
Shit what a deal word up, how much it cost now
Shit what the deal word up how much it cost
Play your position listen, where is your pot to piss in
'Fore we start really kissin, hot as freaky kitchen
Hey what the deal word up how much it cost now
Hey what the deal word up how much it cost now

[Chorus] - 2X
