[Intro]
Give it to me

[Verse 1: Jason Derulo]
Got me 'bout to break my neck, tell me how you pop like that
You do it like it ain't no sweat, I've never seen a bubble so fat
You do it all day in the mirror, you practice all day in the mirror
Left cheek, right cheek all year, I'm calling you out and I hope you hear it

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty (woo)
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty (woo)
Drop a dollar on the floor hope she give it to me (woo)
A ghetto booty, a ghetto booty (woo)
She dump that trunk but she don't look back (woo)
She put it in reverse and I can't be mad (woo)
I can't be mad at that baby fat (woo)
That's a ghetto booty, a ghetto booty

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
She just wanna pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop that bubblegum (woo)
She just wanna pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop that bubblegum (woo)
If she keeps blowing, it might explode, never seen a girl like you before
She just wanna pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop that bubblegum (woo, oh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Jason Derulo]
You do it like a professional, but you gon' get on schedule
Looking so pretty in pink, acting like your shit don't stank
You do it all day in the mirror (all day), you practice all day in the mirror (all day)
Left cheek, right cheek all year, I'm calling you out and I hope you hear it

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty (woo)
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty (woo)
Drop a dollar on the floor hope she give it to me (woo)
A ghetto booty, a ghetto booty (woo)
She dump that trunk but she don't look back (woo)
She put it in reverse and I can't be mad (woo)
I can't be mad at that baby fat (woo)
That's a ghetto booty, a ghetto booty

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
She just wanna pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop that bubblegum (woo)
She just wanna pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop that bubblegum (woo)
If she keeps blowing, it might explode, never seen a girl like you before
She just wanna pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop that bubblegum (woo, oh, yeah)

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Ha, blow it like a bubble, bazooka, baby
Clouds on the couch, you my hookah, baby
She got that senile, make a grown man crazy
Got that senile, make a grown man crazy
Ha, shawty in the gym, ass-mazin' (agh)
I pull up, I get her, as easy
It's too late to go back, she look back, I'm cheesin'
I'm Kodak, my Rolex, a moment, the history
Yeah, pussy bomb, tick-tock (agh)
Eyes lock, lip lock, thing pop, I'm done (agh)
T-Raww, heart numb, no love, heart spun
Baby, give me some yum yum (woo)
Big wheelie, surfboard (yeah, surfboard)
Wheelie on the jock, do your thang, girl
And I need me a ride or die and you's a freak
I got seven different girls every day of the week but

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo & Tyga]
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty (woo) (agh, yeah)
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty (woo)
Drop a dollar on the floor hope she give it to me (woo)
A ghetto booty, a ghetto booty (woo)
She dump that trunk but she don't look back (woo)
She put it in reverse and I can't be mad (woo)
I can't be mad at that baby fat (woo)
That's a ghetto booty, a ghetto booty

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
She just wanna pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop that bubblegum (woo)
