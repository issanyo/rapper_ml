[Intro]
Yeah what's up
(background talking)

I'm  your nigga i'm you nigga on tha way
I'm  your nigga i'm you nigga on tha way
You know tha tight rap, get money er single day
I roll a weed wrap get money er single day

[Verse 1]
Direction i'm moving is opposite
I know what i'm doing I got this shit
22 in the profits I promise you
Like this is no secret it's obvious
That you niggas be taking all kinda risks
Baby stay home and wake up for dick
You can GPS me anyday
That Uber can bring you here anyway
Travelling, moving from state to state
Then let me finish my dinner plate
Swear to God if a nigga see barricades
Ima bust through them barricades
If you a fake then say you a fake
Like what much you cannot say
A young nigga moving up and once I get the pay
Perk is on, Trey is on Nick is on, homies on glasses on
The whole squad moves along

[Chorus ]
I'm  your nigga i'm you nigga on tha way
So if you think I do, I don't give a fuck what you say
Neva thought about it
I'm  your nigga i'm you nigga on tha way
I'm  your nigga i'm you nigga on tha way
You know tha tight rap, get money er single day
I roll a weed wrap get money er single day
I'm  your nigga i'm you nigga on tha way
I'm  your nigga i'm you nigga on tha way
You know tha tight rap, get money er single day
I roll a weed wrap get money er single day

[Verse 2]
Homie get staying on top of things
Way way on top of things
I just went honestly, that's the best policy
Trust me i'm on ma way I do this properly
I got ma pots in place I could be sound asleep
But I get to people don't know the way
So i stay awake just to give em faith
Celebrating today like Columbus day
The way that I travel and navigate
You can't seem to get on your way
Cause you don't know things that we gotta face
Fuck all this stress you don't need a [?]
Got real estates but I need some change
People so lost they just want the fame
Trust me I know I've been running game
Acting like that man that shit is lurked
There's nothing else to explain but

[Chorus]
I'm  your nigga i'm you nigga on tha way
So if you think I do, I don't give a fuck what you say
Neva thought about it
I'm  your nigga i'm you nigga on tha way
I'm  your nigga i'm you nigga on tha way
You know tha tight rap, get money er single day
I roll a weed wrap get money er single day
