[Intro]
Tell me pretty baby if you wanna make love tonight
Tell me baby baby if you wanna make love tonight
Tell me baby baby if you wanna make love tonight
Tell me baby baby if you wanna make love tonight
Tell me baby baby if you wanna make love tonight
Tell me baby baby if you wanna make love tonight

[Verse]
I want you, you
I've had a few, but never you
And damn it, boy I want you
Said it girl, I'd never doubt, I'd never know
I want you, could've been over
I want you
Tell me baby, I, I
