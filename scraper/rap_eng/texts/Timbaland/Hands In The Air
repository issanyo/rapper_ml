[Intro: Timbaland]
Dance all (night)
I said dance all (night)

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
Hey baby girl: Looking all done up
I wanna know: Where did you come from?
The heat begin to raise... Hot woman
The club about to go into flames... Baby, speakers thumping
Let's party hard, and just move something
The vibe is right and it goes, goes, goes, goes something like this:

[Hook: Timbaland]
Such a beautiful crowd...
The levels on 10...
People standing on chairs with their hands up in the air
Girls getting real wild...
Hair blowing in the wind...
Girls standing on the chairs with their hands up in the air

[Chorus]
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
High heels, standing on them soft couch cushions
Careful, not to break her concentration
Maintain sexy as she maintains balance (balance)
If you fall, baby girl it won't be cute at all (at all)
Drink in your left hand (left hand)
Girlfriend in your right (your right)
On the couch dancing (dancing)
Holding on for dear life (life)
Thump of the music (plus!)
The flash of the light (plus!)
Long legs and a short skirt equal one hell of a night!
Know what I'm talking about?

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Timbaland & Ne-Yo]
Uh, hands in the air
Uh, hands in the air
I got my eyes closed!
Jumping up and down, baby I'm on ten
I got my eyes closed!
Listen to the sounds, so hypnotizing (Hey!)
And I bet before the night ends (Hey!)
I'm going to find one that I'm liking
Take her home, get it on next morning
Baby girl, give me that one more gin before you go
(I got my hands in the air) I got my eyes closed
(I got my hands in the air) I got my eyes closed
(I got my hands in the air) I got my eyes closed
(I got my hands in the air)
My hands, my hands, in the air, in the air...

[Hook]

[Chorus]
