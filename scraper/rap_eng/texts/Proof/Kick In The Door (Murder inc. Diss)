[Hook 1: Proof]
Go, go, go, go
Go, go
I got P.A. at your doorway
I got Seven Mile at your door way
I got Schoolcraft at your doorway
We gon' kick the hinges off your doorway for shallow
Tips and slugs, to put up in your mug
Every nigga on your team already been plugged
I'm in to breakin' necks, not in to fightin' scrubs
I ain't got no love, D12, ridin' for Bugz
Got hollow tips and slugs, to put up in your mug
Every nigga on your team already been plugged
I'm in to breakin' necks, not in to fightin' scrubs
I ain't got no love, D12, ridin' for Bugz

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
Ha
Y'all ain't seein' Shady Records, who the fuck you thought this was?
You beefin' with G-Unit, they gon' throw you out the club
You try to front on Obie, you gon' have to see a slug
If you fuck with Dirty Dozen, we be killin' who you love
We above you bitch niggas 'cause y'all been kissin' ass so long you're not a man, your mama just gave birth to a thong
It hurts when I'm around and worse when I'm gone
I smother ya, label me "murder", "dirt coverer"
Slash "hersh burglar"
Your ass'll burn more than a lab spilled with acid
It won't be goin' further than that drastic ass-kick
Niggas gettin' clowned, we dick pissin'
They caught pissin' sittin' down
I'll snatch your wrenches, so bitches can cancel Christmas
It ain't no color shit, and fuck wearing trenches
You swimming with the fishes (nigga)
I don't need a mask, I got pictures in your kitchen
I leave a nigga linched for even mentionin' a mission
And all of the attention gon' be sent back to your henchmen
And they get different pigment
I can't keep it lyrical, once you walk the streets
They'll consider niggas "missing", it's all apart of beef
I keep beaters all around me, approach me and start it
They won't eat I'll have you stealin' out of grocery markets
Hoes just be retarded, supposed to be the hardest
But the only thing they smart at, is posing as a target

[Bridge: Swifty McVay]
Y'all think, y'all heat could stop McVay
Y'all see me, y'all ain't got shit to say
Y'all creep, y'all peeps, y'all streets was deep
D12 don't give a fuck about you anyway

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
Yo
Now when niggas get to babblin', bullets get to travelin'
Have 'em on some Judgement Day, Jesus and Heaven shit
Send your body flyin' through the air like a javelin
On some Manson shit and I ain't talkin' about "Marylin"
You know Kuniva, nigga I'll be rowdy as fuck
Roll up on you with a gauge and blow you out of your truck
And I ain't no John Gotti, more like a sawed shotty
I don't wear minks, I wear full length dead bodies
Whattup do'? I don't play cards, I'm real cutthroat
Take the finest bitch that you datin' and run a busto
Hot shots settlin' inside your stomach now it's simmerin'
Bullets calm hype niggas down better than Ritalin
You little son of a bitch, packin' one in a clip
You always runnin' your lip, you probably born with a clit

[Interlude]
"I'm the king of this muthafucka, we run shit, been runnin' it
We been gettin' money around here"
"Fuck y'all niggas, this First Born, niggas"
(Gunshots and ricochets against cars and metal)
(Woman screams in terror)

[Verse 4: Proof]
Cap n' Town, drop it down, got the drool in my face
It's all Proof, finger streets, just caught in the case
Had to do him, yeah I knew him, but he fronted on "P."
Called out 'cause his mouth just runnin' on feast
Now how the fuck you gon' act like Proof is just dizzy?
E'rybody know me, I'm the truth in the city
You don't want me against ya, the inventor of beef
Turn the streets of the D against ya
P-Pis-P-pistol, pulverizin' the punks, period
Provin' the P-power, it's painful
Fuck your energy, your plain flow, I stay cold
I got more G's than Bobanga got more sugar on his payroll
The Proof is in it like Prego
In Detroit I've been poppin', more than Faygo
I never speak what's not true
Bush will fuck with Osama, but not Proof
D12

[Hook 2: Proof]
I got my chain your doorway
I got Promatic at your doorway
I got Raw-C at your doorway
'Cause we gon' hit the fuckin' hinges off your door fo' sho'
Got hollow tips and slugs, to put up in your mug
Every nigga on your team already been plugged
I'm in to breakin' necks, not in to fighting scrubs
I ain't got no love, D12, ridin' for Bugz
Got hollow tips and slugs, to put up in your mug
Every nigga on your team already been plugged
I'm in to breakin' necks, not in to fighting scrubs
I ain't got no love, D12, ridin' for Bugz

[Outro]
Alright hold on, Proof just sat me back in the booth
Youknowimsayin', cause I was a little too harsh
Youknowimsayin', that's how downtown niggas get down
You can catch me down there, [?] one state
But um, I'ma put it like this man
Real niggas, real street niggas
If you got beef with a nigga, you don't, you don't put kids in it, youknowimsayin'
Real niggas, you don't have to speak on a nigga's kid
Another thing dawg, when your mans need you, and he put you on
You don't turn your fuckin' back on him, youknowimsayin
And for the two niggas that I'm talkin' about, you feel me dawg
But believe me, it's all coming to an end
