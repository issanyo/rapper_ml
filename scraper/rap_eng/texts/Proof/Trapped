[Intro: Eminem]
Big Proof, rest in peace
Doody, we love you
We just wanna keep makin' you proud

[Verse: Proof & Eminem]
My life is trapped in these lines, that’s why I’m packin' these nines
I gotta rap, I ain’t dyin', that’s in the back of my mind
Got a strap made of iron, can’t relax on this grind
Bendin' over backwards for these slackers 'til I’m snappin' my spine
Natural high, gotta focus, on these bogus poachers
Lookin' over my shoulder, Proof get it poppin' like soda, hold up
We nothin' but soldiers, slow up, this gun is loaded, roll up
They beef and we leavin' ‘em coked up
If Slim say it I spray it, if he will it I kill it
We Kilpatrick and Ilitch of Detroit, y'all can feel it
Real as this gun on my waistline, at war we don’t waste time
[Ja, man] he can’t take a punch and 50 can take nine
We got school crap here at the 7, 8, and Dexter
I’m up in Hollis spendin’ dollars, ain’t feelin' no pressure
Yes sir, your texture is bitch, betcha you flinch
When Proof shoot up that coup and wet your whole clique
