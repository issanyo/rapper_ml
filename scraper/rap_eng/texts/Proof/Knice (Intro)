[Announcer]
What up Detroit!
I'd like to welcome everybody to the
First Annual Detroit Hip-Hop Awards
Secondly, I'd like to thank you for coming out
And supporting all of our events this year
Especially the Awards show
That means a lot to us
The vision behind the Award show
Is to recognize our own
Talents, feats and accomplishments
Both locally and nationally
With the community a part of the success of people like:
Eminem, D12, Obie Trice, Slum Village, Fat Cat
Sick Notes, Fat Killers, Almighty Dreadnaps
Raw C and Silent Riot, just to touch on a few
The first award we'll be presenting tonight
Is the Hip-Hop Recognition Award
This Award is to recognize
The individual for outstanding support of Detroit Hip-Hop
When I think of that
One person stands out without a doubt
From the days of the Hip-Hop shop
To the days of multi-platinum record sales
You'll see this guy on MTV Wednesday night
Then you'll catch him at St. Andrews Hall Friday night hosting a battle
He's been around the world
And still finds time to get back to the city
That being said, it's both a pleasure and an honor
To present the first Annual Hip-Hop Recognition Award!
*Purple Pills starts playing*
To none other than my man, Big, Proof!

[Proof *While announcer is talking*]

But don't feel like I've accomplished, nothin' at all
Hip-Hop...

Detroit and Hip-Hop, damn, pssh
Psh, eh. Cause I ain't changin' for shit
I'ma always be me
