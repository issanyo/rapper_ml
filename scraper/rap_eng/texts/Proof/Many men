(Background starts)
Hey, yo, Im the king of this muthafucka, I'm the king of Detroit You do what I say what I say nigga, yo dont say it we gonna smoke this nigga 'Proof'
Fuck that you shoot that nigga, right there, get that nigga!
King Of Detroit, what up now fool, what up now nigga!

[Intro-Singing:]
Many men, wish death upon P
Its hard to survive in the 313
I'm trying to be what Im destined to be
And niggas tryin to take my life away
I put a hole in a nigga for fuckin wit me
He ain't come dollo face in 1E
Watch what you say when you talk about me
Cuz I come and take your life away
Many men, many many many many men
Wish death upon me
Dog I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

[Verse 1]
Man these pussy niggas put money on head
Gonna get your refund, cuz motha fucka I ain't dead
I'm the dozen in the dirt, that ain't been found
The real king of the 'D' (shit) that ain't been crowned
When Im on, something special happens every time
Im the dopest, something like Roy Jones in his prime
I walk the planks of the jungle, got a problem then fuck you
Show you what my gun do, if you whack and unhumble
Be for real, punk niggas, your new to the beat
Ask any playa in the 'D', your new to the streets
Ya'll ain't from 7 mile, and y'all ain't wound
Fuck a bone, when you hear that *click* its a gun!

[Hook]
Many men, many many many many men wish death upon me
Dog I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men, many many many many men
Wish death upon me

[Verse 2]
Now there wouldn't be real, if it wasn't for no heart
If there wasn't 8 mile, there wouldn't be O Port
Death gotta be easy, cuz life is hard
Murk you in afterlife, and see twice the god
This is for my niggas on the yo, doin there time
The real murkers in Detroit, that shine on the ground
I heard about that little hit, that u put in the hood
But your shootifyougetshot ain't gonna do no good
Im like MG for shady, you can call me 'the Don'
If you Micheal mothafucka, you gonna die in the storm
Can't switch sides homie, let cash ride homie
Thought we was cool, why you want me to die homie?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You know how many mothafuckas wanna hear your bone break?
PA 7 Mile, FA's on May
School craft LA mack and B-wick
CCs Runyan AV. That's who 'P' wit
The cops don't know much, where I tuck my Glock
I got the word from E-dog when Stuck got locked
Ain't gunna spell it out for you muthafuckas on the grind
Are you blind nigga, can't read between the lines
From Cameon, Rico Shocka and G-low
Rock man, First born, boxy and Dlow
Now lets clear, Im here for a real reason
He do a a hit, I do a hit, lets see who's still breathin'
*gasp*

[Outro-Singing:]
Many Friends
I lost to this game, and this cocksucka come namin names
So many hommies that passed away
Run up on him, point-blank and blast away
Many friends, many many many many friends
That died on me
I should have preserved my dog, poured out on the curb for ya'll
Your R.I.P
Many friends
I lost to this game, and this cocksucka coome namin names
So many hommies that passed away
Run up on him point-blank and blast away
For Lewon, Click-click, Bugs and Snook, Don't care bout all them drugs he took
Watch what you say when you talk about me, Cuz Im always gonna walk the 'D'
Many friends
That died on me
I shall have preserved my dogs, poured out on the curb for y'all
Yo R.I.P
