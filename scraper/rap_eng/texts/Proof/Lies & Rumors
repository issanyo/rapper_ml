Here we go...

[Hook]
They say that one little lie turns into another, then you go and cheat
By the time you know it, you are wrapped up in a whole bunch of seaweed
You shoulda listened to your mama, and listened to your daddy, when they tried to speak
And tell you that there's just too many fishes in the sea

[Repeat 8X]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1: Kon Artis]
Now this thing here, it may cause concern, but
It's just a little story bout a shark eatin worms
It's, not a riddle, but subliminally catches on
How one little lie can turn into a bigger one
When I was a young, guppy in the sea
You could see all the bigger fish pickin on me
Cause they knew I didn't really have the guard or bullet
And the other sharks that have teeth sharper than me
I'm a never-endin story about a shark this big
The load of kids that got an act for fizz
So sit back, kick back with a bag of chips
While I tell you bout something stupid I did...

[Hook]
They say that one little lie turns into another, then you go and cheat
By the time you know it, you are wrapped up in a whole bunch of seaweed
You shoulda listened to your mama, and listened to your daddy, when they tried to speak
And tell you that there's just too many fishes in the sea

[Verse 2: Proof]
I'm off to work but I'm late (hey) but what can I say? (hey)
I'm cool with the boss and then of course it's a payday
We reachin the weekend and I'll be treatin my baby
Typical day, dude's in the way - but hey wait!
Shark's in the water, gotta duck in the corner
'til I'm caught, I'mma talk and I walk where I wanna
Hittin the seaweed, sippin this green tea
Big fish in this small world, they'll all believe me
For knocking a shark off, protecting my city
They all grab my CD and now I'm a popular rock star
Like it or not though I'm a marvelous artist
Working my hardest and becoming a starfish

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
Now what am I to do? The boss is on my back
I gotta follow his orders when sharks attack
It's a dangerous scene, but I'm a Rasta man
Cross me and my brother, it will cost ya, man
And this little pipsqueak is gettin' on my nerves
So my tentacles should give him just what he deserves
So you better swim fast cause I'm after ya
And go and hide inside the mouth of a clam or somethin'
Cause I'm out and about - I'm bad news, a henchman
A jellyfish with an attitude, so listen
Swim for your life cause I'm on your tail
So frightenin I scare a snail out of its shell

[Hook]
They say that one little lie turns into another, then you go and cheat
By the time you know it, you are wrapped up in a whole bunch of seaweed

[Verse 4: Swift]
I love this liquid, I'm silly when I'm in it and I bet
(This water we're standin in is wet)
Duh! What do you expect from me?
I'm a platinum Jack Dempsey, trying to get a fee
And everybody know that I'm the G of the sea
I just knocked this shark off - the dude tried to eat me
I guess he didn't like me, it might be because I'm a Pisces
They always try to take me lightly
So why the trouble? I just wanna hustle
And multiply bubbles and pump my muscles
I don't want to make a mistake
Cause these fishermen will set you up, and I ain't fallin for the bait

(Daddy - what are we gonna do with a fish with a tattoo?
We're gonna eat him. What do you think?)

[Verse 5: Bizarre]
I'm a lionfish with dreams of makin it big
House in the ocean, three ugly kids
And why everybody keep on pickin on me?
I'm the sexiest, prettiest fish in the sea
Heck no, I ain't nobody dish
Cause I'm in love with Angie - the beautiful angelfish
{*kissing sound*} Give me a kiss baby
I'm running from the white shark, you tryin to make me crazy

[Hook]

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
