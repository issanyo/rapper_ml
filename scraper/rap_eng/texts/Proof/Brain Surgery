[Chorus: Eminem]
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back get back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back get back

[Verse 1: Proof]
Doing a ron on doctrine and stompin’ oxygen
[?] Nine or ten put a fork through your optic lense
Hittin’ with sudden force, then your boy laying in the same
Puddle of blood [?] blood sport
Smuggle a gun in court and shoot the judge
Easily [?] some thugs who the future [?]
A double deuce with slugs, and Proof on drugs
Will turn you to a rapper that you used to love
High from your medicine cabinet, pills
Grabbing the steel, leaping off of buildings that haven’t been built
I’m not the best yet, ‘cause I haven’t been killed
I’m laughing at you faggot rappers with deals

[Chorus: Eminem]
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back get back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back get back

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Disappointed in my dentist appointment
He only gave me the fucking gas for thirty minutes this morning
Went to the hospital to get a chest X-ray
Checked out the next day, in a dress with a sex change
I’m having a bad day, my fucking dads gay
I hate fags and I’m fucking mad ‘cause I don’t have AIDS
All I wanna do is die, I tried suicide six times
Couldn’t even do it right
Relaxed had a relapse and called three cabs
And had to be dragged back to rehab with bloody kneecaps
Enrolled myself in a twelve step program
Tripped on the first step, and got pinned down in a choke slam
I sware to God this pop culture comes any closer
I’m kicking his whole fucking wall over
Two more shots and it’s all over
I’m all over this wall, try not to fall over

[Chorus: Eminem]
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back get back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back get back

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
BLAOW BLAOW, shots in broad day
[Bizarre that’s your Mom!]
The bitch shouldn’t have been in the way
Me shady and mic fucking a hermaphrodite
My little sister was a virgin, till late last night
Tell all my boys take turns
[didn't finish transcribing this verse]
