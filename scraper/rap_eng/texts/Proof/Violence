[Intro: Proof]
Violence
Take one
If you hearing this, this a rough draft
Got no business listening to us
[talking]

On the real, listen


[Verse 1: Proof]
Put the streets in a niggas eyes
Put the beef in a niggas mind
Put his teeth on a killers nine
No remorse when i kill his mom, illest rhyme
Hit the panic button, keep the whole planet ducking
Stand for nothing, but fall from slugs
I give it all for bugz
Dont make me call my thugs
Yeah, i'm a lady hitter, hit your moms and a babysitter
A crazy killer
Spit the house on your favourite nigga
My techs loud, slugs at your chest hard, through your vest guard
Get your thresh and your neck scarred
Feels the fire, your hear "pop, pop"
And squeal and tire, run for the hills and higher
Get your brand new gun, no you's (?)
Talk loud, but get snuffed out
By hired men
That's what we do to you cowards
I'm rolling off E, at your wake, smelling your funeral flowers

[Hook: Proof]
Kill, smash, murder shoot
Rob, steal, hurt her, loot
Violence, violence, violence, violence
Kill smash, murder, shoot
Rob, steal, hurt her, loot
Violence, violence, violence, violence

[Verse 2: Proof]
Put your fingers in the blender, make them finger food
Break off a wing and chew, and drown you in a swimming pool
I'm not a criminal, i haven't been caught, LAUGH!
You not a corner draft, chewing [?]
My pants down to my calf when i walk
Until the [?] kick my fucking ass when i talk
Don't love nothing, dirty harry scare kids
Fuck work, school, shit and marriage
A perilous terrorist, don't believe in sharing spit
Like the sun and moon, and your air and shit
Open your score, like the glove my gun run out of
Clutch the 40, fuck a closet ain't got shit to come out off
One out of every nine MC's is sleeping with him
Fucking faggots, all savages beefing with Em
Bringing the D, and my hood is grimey
Y'all running like motherfucking shooks behind me

[Hook]

I miss happy birth, what?
I live, so i'm back grabbing my privates
Screaming "DIE BITCH!"
I'm rough hided like nymphos with dry clits
Can't none of ya'll see me like the back off my eyelids
I'm why kids rebel and act up
And all i wanted was a dick sucked and my back rubbed
Flavor flav, shoulders with [?]
I'm the resorter, sex, whiskey and mad drugs
Raised by macks and pimps
Smack a bitch on purpose (smack) shit then by accident (smack)
Unload my gat and clips, i'm the imacculate
Your vertebrae break bitch, when your back get bent
Crack the fifth, and roll the hydro
"Slow down P!"
"Bitch, i wanna die slow!"
Since kinder garden, wanted to be a [?]
To give my loving ass mama something to cry for
I pack this violence and vile shit
Love it when mature people call me childish
Get your eyebrow ripped, "throw in a [?] quick!"
Toss a brown brick
Through your fucking moms crib
Ain't shitted on you in a while
Now i'm about it
"do you know where hell is?"
I'm a kamikaze pilot
Death, i'm on a mission to find it
Plus i'm half blinded
Swallowing pills, i'm absent minded
Taking E, vitamin C, until my spine split
"I DON'T SUCK DICK!"
Quit lying bitch
I'm high as shit
And the headphones ain't buzzing
It's the dirtiest shogun from Dirty Dozen

[Hook]


[Outro: Proof]
What, what?
Shut the fuck up, Proof
This is Dirty Harry style
We ain't going nowhere
