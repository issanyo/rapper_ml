[Hook 1]
What you all about
(?) call out
Knock'em all out
Real niggas pull your mouth out
Punch your grill in
How you feelin this is our house
Dumb nigga, what you thinkin 'bout
[Hook 2]
SICK NOTES TAKES NO SHORTS FROM NO-ONE
SICK NOTES TAKES NO SHORTS FROM NO-ONE

[Bakarak]
Niggas don't wanna get me pissed
Have you waving at your people without no wrist
Only Nigga you know won't drink chrizz
For dumb niggas I got 2 sticks and fists
It ain't a crew out there that could fuck with this
I'm Devilsish, like demon
Quick to bust guns and a semem
Ain't childish rapper with all that blingin
My style ain't gonna switch from rap to singin
But I might rap a strangle
Any rap nigga I'm angle get buried
Give a fuck if he got kids and married
Shit trien to make my day, like my name was Dirty Harry
If the industry was a movie, I'll make the game scary
First nigga to put the world in the bitchuary
I'm the type to beat you in the face with sticks like drums and it'll
Sound like (Uh Uh Uh!)

(Hook 1)

[Jus Bounce]
First off, my flows is crucial
And the brain sergeon sayed I had the nerves to shoot you
Catch you in the street and front you out
(????????) stomp you out
I'm crazy in the mouth like pac and juice
Catch you at the liquor store, cock and let loose
Make your face resemble a fruit loop
Have you (???????)
Trien' to tempt me is risky, mighty gutsy
Ask Dstout about Puffy
So when I tell you this shit trust me
Its not in your best intrest
To be on my shitlist
Its really senceless
They get beat senceless
Change your name and relocate the menthous
The only way they know who you is, is by the dentist

[Dogmatic]
Fo' real, I'm the first nigga to yell "313"
Since 19 mother fucking 93
Check my stats, I'm comin all over the track
Smack you in the back with some 8 Mile matic attack
Shit I killed K-Stone, as a matter a fact
We ain't forgot, Sicknotes shit be hot
I'm wide open like a spot you must be smoke rocks to the bit in that you
Can stop the matic from reachin top
Beat you with a sock, stuff the combination locks
If I ever saw trien to open my lock
Kevin's all stock, nothin unofficial
You can never catch me without the clip in my pistol

[Proof]
Power and PAM publics position
Proof beside pioneers, poetic prison
Pin point periodic poison playin Picasso so
Perfect punk and perverted pust poe
Playin punished shit to peers, or any prick
Passively push pain, punks panic and run frantic
Don't giva a fuck like minni small whores
Stick a mic in your paw like the dog wars
For the last B Boys skip here like astroids
Skip up on your crew, 1 by 1, blast you boys
Set the pool on fire (???????)
This year alot of bitch ass MC's gonna retire
