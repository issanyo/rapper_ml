{Freestyle over Jay-Z's 'So Ghetto'}

[Intro: Eminem (Proof)]
Yeah. Now I'm getting distorted. (Can you turn it down) When I was...I should've been aborted. But it was too late...uh oh. (Uh oh) Yo, just turn up the beat a little bit. I don't care if the mic is distorted. Fuck it

[Eminem]
That's it, that's it, gotta hit than pass it
I'm blasted off a tab of acid
Flabbergasted
Hopped in a cab and blasted the cab driver
I said...haha
Hold on a minute
Give me infinite beats that I can kick for a minute
Y'all don't understand
The way that I got this mic in my hand
Killing any MC who stands or sits or walks
Or is handicapped
It doesn't Mr. Handicap, hand me that
Haha
I clap hands with the rap fans
Jump in their wheelchairs and give 'em a lap dance
I'm the illest MC who will kill this
And what?
And Die Hard like who?
(Bruce Willis)
Thank you very much that's a fucking cliche
But I will rock the microphone and don't care about what he say
Or they say or I say or we say or them say
Eminem say shit that only Slim say
Or Slim says
Fuck a les
-bian in her ass
Korean or a...
Haha

[Interlude: Proof talking]
Ayo, let me try something. Uh uh uh uh uh uh. I'm not free in here, check it out

[Proof]
I rap if there was no rap within a soul clap
Expose wack rappers and smack 'em with my bozack
Flatten 'em like inner tubes
Punch my fist through the torso of thinner dudes
And when I'm in the mood make a serious winner lose
Get high of gin and booze

[Eminem]
Hahahaha
In an inner tube
While I'm in the nude
With a centerfold
In the winter cold

[Proof]
Ayo we give it though
Give me an envelope
I get with Tim Westwood show
And Cypher Sounds I strike you down
Don't like the way you sound, you wack now
You got my style packed down or should I say down pack
Any MC's will tell you right now that you sound wack
Call us up and then we make noise then see shells
We shall prevail you faker than Lee Nails
And we tell D-12 to all those that don't know
Flow for flow we rocking your radio
How you feel right now?
C'mon Shady flow
Yo, yo, yo

[Interlude: Eminem and Proof talking]
[E] Yo, turn the beat up a little bit
[P] I know, it's like the beat is like mad low
[E] Hello, hello, hello, check, check, check
[P] Hello
[E] Check, check, check

{beat switches to LL Cool J's 'Ill Bomb'}

[E] What, what?
[P] Awwww shit
[E] Yo, turn the beat up a little bit
[P] Yeah, just turn it up, up, up, up
[Cypher Sounds] C'mon Tim turn it up
[E] Yeah, just turn it up Tim
[P] Let it be distorted. Yo, yo, yo

[Eminem]
Trapped in a cinema, in a material world
Criminal, cops scour the rural area thorough
Cause I kissed a girl, married a girl
Carried a girl to the cemetery, buried a girl
And I'm desperate, no one to mess with
Always get arrested for something domestic
And I kill the way you met me
You'll never catch me, cops can't sketch me
You can't upset me, no matter how bad
How mad you get me
Problem with y'all, I'm letting the Tec speak
Went from sweet to hard
Beat the odds
From no hoes to show, quit the pizza job
No more fools to rob, no more geeks to rob
No more stolen cars, no more Visa cards
(Visa cards)
Slim Shady
(Slim Shady and D-12)
