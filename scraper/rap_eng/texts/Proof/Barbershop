[Intro: Kon Artis]
This time we're gonna do our thing (Huh)
Is that aight wit' y'all? (Yeah)
It's gotta be 'cause we gon' do it anyway
Ain't that right fellaz (Yeah)
Fellaz ain't that right (Yeah)
Haha

[Hook: Kon Artis]
Tell ya people, that I'm the man
I can't be faded, there's been a change of plans
You can meet me at the barbershop (At the barbershop)
At the barbershop (At the barbershop)
You can meet me at the barbershop (C'mon, where?)
At the barbershop (At the barbershop)

[Verse 1: Kon Artis]
Well, it's Friday afternoon and I just woke up (*burp-fart*)
That's right I just woke up
From an excruciating evening at work, woman so what
That it's two-thirty-PM, I'm grown dammit straight up
And know when through my finger either I think it is time we bust, you know
Leave the premises less you planning to cook, I mean it's
Three o'clock and I gotta gimme a cut for that
Big party tonight thrown at K-P Productions
And I don't wanna lose my spot
'Cause everybody know "Big O" got the tightest fans on the block
So I got to be in that seat at Four o'clock
Shoot I need me some crispy-ones to go with my new outfit
So tell ya people

[Hook: Kon Artis]
Tell ya people, that I'm the man
I can't be faded, there's been a change of plans
You can meet me at the barbershop (At the barbershop)
At the barbershop (At the barbershop)
You can meet me at the barbershop (C'mon, where?)
At the barbershop (At the barbershop)

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
Understand me now, I'm cool as a breeze (Wassup playa, wassup)
On the black hand side, gimme some grease (Alright)
I want a line-up and I don't want you to fate me (Nope)
A ghetto girl with an attitude to come and braid me
So what's happening, the hood's seeing in
I get the scoop on everyone in the ghetto so let's begin
Who got shot? (Mike) Who got jumped? (Eric)
Who got ganked? (Shay) Who got robbed? (Dee)
Who went to jail? (Chuck) Who got saved? (Rick)
Who's getting money and who's broke as a joke
And hear about your lady called me that started smoking that dope
You get it all at this little dusty place
Let me be still, she getting out the razor from my face

[Hook: Kon Artis]
See tell ya people, that I'm the man
I can't be faded, there's been a change of plans
You can meet me at the barbershop (At the barbershop)
At the barbershop (At the barbershop)
You can meet me at the barbershop (C'mon, where?)
At the barbershop (At the barbershop)

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
You heard of me, the fat guy that raps
Now it's time for Bizarre to take off his shower cap
It's been five days, I patiently waited
Saturday morning, it's time to get faded
And I mean get faded, "I mean get faded"
Damn at four o'clock, I didn't almost make it
My barber's name is Sarah, she don't really know how to cut
But she got some nice teeth and big ol' butt
So two days a week, I get faded for no reason
Same old haircut, keep it low and even
If you see me in a barbershop, go on and run
'Cause I'm probably getting a perm and my toe-nails done

[Verse 4: Proof Kon Artis]
Got here full grip, but can't call the cops
I gotta get the script from the lips to the barbershop
Jump in the seat "Yo, give me the line and"
And tell me who came through shining
My homeboy scooped up, in a new truck
Gave everybody a cup and gave me a few bucks
Then he started bragging 'bout his last lick
Cut me a design along with his address

[Verse 5: Swift]
You can have a million dollar suit on, shining with your karats up
But it don't mean nothing if ya flogging in your haircut
Now who next? (Um, I just want my son to get a tape-up)
What about you sweetie? (So what you trying say?)
I'm just playing with you baby (Hey, he do this all the time)
And all you do is whine, and drink wine (Hahaha)
Yo, you know that Cho-chie got knocked out? (Man) (When?)
Early at Le'mott's house (Again?)
(I wouldn't let that man sit on my couch)
(You was wit' him yesterday)
(Man what are you talking 'bout?)
I'm just about ready to throw y'all out
(No you ain't, I'll be here for 'bout a hour)
You know I'll raise up the rates

[Hook: Kon Artis]
Tell ya people, that I'm the man
I can't be faded, there's been a change of plans
You can meet me at the barbershop (At the barbershop)
At the barbershop (At the barbershop)
You can meet me at the barbershop (C'mon, where?)
At the barbershop (At the barbershop)
