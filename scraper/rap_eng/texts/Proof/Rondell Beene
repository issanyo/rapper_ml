[Rondell Beene]
You know I dont discriminate
I killed bitches, I killed, pets
Dogs, Cats, uhh, Canaries
Anything, you know that's just how I do it
Y'know back to what I was saying
This is Rondell Beene, back on the mother fucking scene
It's been a while since you seen me
But now I'm real, ice and gleamy
Nah, not really, y'know I just got home so
I ain't really out there like that
But on some real shit dawg
Y'know what I'm sayin', I'm talkin' 'bout pimpin
You know how I do it
I keeps, a, a nice flock o' hoes wit' me
You know and, y'know they always sayin' about ma style
Y'know what I'm sayin'...
Put my Pimp coat down bitch, now, y-y-yer too close now
Sit your ass down for your position, now that's Doggy-style
Y'know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Anyway though, uh, y'know what I'm sayin'
I'm kinda proud o' these niggas that did 'n' came up
From tryin' to bein' pimps, to bein', Assistant pimps
Y'know what I'm sayin
And everybody knows Rondell Beene is the true pimp of all pimps
Y'know I gave Proof his first hand-me-down Cango
He, he don't give me no props for it
But it's all good, cause he's keepin' ma commissary full
Y'know what I'm sayin', shout out to ma man Big Proof
For getting me on his album
For givin' me the oppurtunity, to express, ma, ma whole
Uh, outlook and exorcism about pimpin'
Y'know what I'm sayin', and that's what I do
Y'know what I'm... Bitch
Didn't I tell you to put ma glass down
If I take these headphones off, I'ma, I'ma lay hands on you
Okay, aight okay we'll settle down then, settle down
But that's how I do it, so keep it locked right here
Cause my man Big Proof and D12 gone tell you somethin' about some real pimpin'
Little bitch!
