[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
How I live...
My microphone is my outlet
To project my style and see how loud the crowd can get
No nonsense this is how you need to be livin'
Dude this is the life we show improve on each and every move
We need some money smoking bitches to clear our vision like visine
And a 40 of O-E for the I.V
So gimme, gimme cause I'm livin' for the fame
And I ain't leavin' till I get all that I can and then some

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
I see it tatted on your back and your arms
And I’m a estatic you would get it tho what’s killin' your mom
I know your pops don't understand he thinks you're building a bomb
Because you sit up in your room and every word you sing along
And it seems every word comin' outta your mouth is raw
And the truth is they don't have a clue whats going on
If they would just shut the fuck up give me a listen
Then they could hear it all in my voice exactly how I'm livin

[Hook x2]
That's how I live
Griding on the streets that we live
That's how I live
Trying to take as much as you give
That's how I live
Planting fantasies in your kids
That's how I live
Don't be actin' like you know who this is
(that's how I live)

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
How i live
Tinted windows on suv's I'm smokin'
Purchesed from grammer and words spoken
Uh hustla i was born and raised
With the knowlege that you gotta do
What you gotta to get paid
Can't respect game
I'll see you on the grind
Same heart same passion its my three of a kind
It's Twiztid and your boy proof from the dirty dozen
This shit was destined to happen don't ever say it wasn't

[Verse 4: Proof]
Please belive it we sit and re-think it
Spit flames just blow ur mind and re-heat it re-seaded
Slim nov for cons fifty knee beezy
And necro jigga it's d tweezy
Twiztid we be's the misfits
Keep squeezin bisquits
Street clean the district
This means restricted
Family nah ambity time
You cross one of them you cross me I'm layin you down

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Monoxide]
Affiliated with some folks that most of y'all ain't really heard of
It's keepin' me secret just like a murder
With blurred vision I'm undercover like burned victims
With the temper like a pitbull waitin my turn sick em'
Lickin' my chaps why you sit in the same spot
Like street signs while I resurect the whole east side
That's how I live and you can love it or leave it
But for you to do what I do it'd take your whole life to achieve it

[Verse 6: Proof]
My cousins from other mothers they dozens they brothers of us
Mother that ICP be feared recoverd that gang among us
Pac and Big is the world
Wiping blade exhaust
Tryin to repair the damages and managin they Jay and Bob
So wish to Esham
Detroit in these palms
We tryin to get back to these local cats to point where there from
So I spit it how I'm in it a minute
How I spit it forever walked in it let's get it how we live it it's good

[Hook x2]
