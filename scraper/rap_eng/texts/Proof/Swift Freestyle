[Intro: Swifty]
McVay huh
Dropping grenades pins on you motherfuckers
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga)
Dirty Dozen (What, what, what, what)
Who can fuck with us (Nobody-body-body)
Fuck y'all hoe ass niggas, 'cause y'all don't mean shit to me
(y'all some hoes)
Or any of my niggas, flat out

[Verse 1: Swifty]
Don't let me do something medieval, where you can hardly walk
I hang with people that'll eat your body parts
I'm lethal, on these streets, it ain't peaceful
I can reach whoever that speak, I'll be throwing the beef equal
If you don't keep your heat close
I'ma hang you on a meat post and then expose you to these people
This ain't even your occupation
When I'm in a deceitful situations, I'ma waste 'em, fuck waiting
And if you wanna say something, bitch then say it
You be sitting on your waist, go ahead, I ain't playing
I hate men, you gotta problem wit' it, nigga
I love women, but I socked the hell outta bitch
When I confront it, they get wrecked at home, ticking me off like a metronome
Bullets are flied through they flesh and bones
Without a register chrome
It's been embedded in niggas heads they might as well leave Swift the fuck alone
You see what happened to Cosby
You probably wouldn't have [?] but ain't no ducking and dodging me
I gets to fucking you up constantly
Every time I see you, you be thinking you got lots of beef
You Massengale motherfuckers cannot compete
You gay as hell, these are not your streets
So try to attack me
I'm bound to blow up like an Iraqi nigga with a bomb strapped in back of me
I'm here to laugh at your agony
'Cause actually this masterpiece gon' have a lot of niggas mad at me
I automatically blast your chest cavity
When niggas get treated like the Raggedy Ann family
I'm like 'Semite Sam with two Glocks
Seeing how many men wanna get popped (come again!)
I cannot stop with this doctrine of Hip Hop
And I got it locked with D-12 (suck a cock)

[Outro: Swifty and Proof]
You niggas talk a lot of shit, but are you really equipped?
Y'all niggas ain't ready for war
You wanna trip like y'all after Swift but you ain't really got shit
Y'all niggas ain't ready for war
Ain't this 'bout a bitch, you didn't now these niggas get sick!
Y'all niggas ain't ready for war
I rain on the innocent and the guilty, you finna get ripped
Y'all niggas ain't ready for war
