[Intro: DJ Salam Wreck]
DJ Salam Wreck!

[Proof]
This is me, this is you
This is us, this is Proof
This is you, this is me
This is us, this is Proof
I don’t need forgiveness
I don’t need no religion
I ain’t living my life behind bars or sign Prison
Ain't no job for me
Damn if God only put some love in my house insteada leavin’ mah heart lonely
Trapped inside poverty
Strapped up so properly
Actin' outta hunger
Now I’m wrapped up in robberies
My yearn is to brawl
Got me learnin' the law
Came to school
But a fool
I ain’t turning my jaw (shhh-it)
Hit me? I’m hitting back
Damn sho I’m getting back
Tough behind the streets
Never eat where you shittin’ at
Life as a diplomat
True family and friends
Sittin' back confused, insanity begins
As we travel to the end
And battle not the sick (whut)
Being broke, Harry had his Gat up to his skin
Used to live to fight
Now I’m fightin’ to live
Please believe my own needs
Feed mah wife and mah kids
[Outro]
It’s my life
-We do what we gotta do
Can only do me
-That’s all I know how to do
I gotta get away
-To swallow this Malibu
So pray for me
-‘Cos my life ain't valuable
It’s my life
-We do what we gotta do
Can only do me
-That’s all I know how to do
I gotta get away
-To swallow this Malibu
Straight from the bottle
-Do, shit, I do what I gotta do
