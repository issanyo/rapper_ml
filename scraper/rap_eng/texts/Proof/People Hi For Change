[Chorus]X2
I Get High...
And I pass it to my people

[Verse 1]
I seen my homeboy there with a twenty sac
I said homeboy yo could you give me that
He said yes he give me time give me two dimes
Better catch it with ya next time
I said yo I need it now im trying to get high
He said (??) im trying to pass by
I said no time for that git up what I did
Bust his head with a brick that's what I did

[Chorus]x2

[Verse 2]
I said its like that yo, yo its like that
I said its like that yo I said its like that
I said I like that yo I say its like that
I said its like that yo I like that
Cmon Cmon
I, gotta get high
I, gotta get high
(gotta get high)
I, gotta get high
(gotta get high..)
(i gotta get high...)
