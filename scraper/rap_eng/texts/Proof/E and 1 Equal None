{Verse 1}
Hey yo, I got a friend by the name of Mu he hangs out with Proof and we all stay crew
I gotta group by the name of (??) ain't nuf (??) with saliva Kuniva
Ain't I thought that youse on top then fell to nuttin
Now let me tell you something you don't know why the hell you frontin
But I do, you and your brother had the game on lock
When it came the independence had your name on top
But then came Suge and Master P then your switched the shit
No more acid raps, you flipping bricks
I witnessed you get chased by Champtown
And now you want me to believe you pushing weight now
8 Mile was out, (??) filled with (??)
No matter how much your front, you gotta deal with war
In the D, we all see you ain't no cap-peeler
Locally, it's rock bottom, tell the boys im (??) so
Do you, motherfucker, and I'll be me
I can't believe the devil signed up with ICP
If that's your move I respect it, ain't no fronting, just know that nothing from nothing leaves nothing, motherfucker

[Chorus]
I stand where I stand and I am what I am
And I'll be damned if I let a nigga get in my clan
(SO!)
I'll do me, fool, you do you
And all the loud mouth talking just WHOOPTIE WHOO!
I stand where I stand and I am what I am
And I'll be damned if I let a nigga get in my clan
(SO!)
I'll do me, fool, you do you
And all the loud mouth talking just WHOOPTIE WHOO!

[Verse 2]
First off, the real first name is Cleveland (??)
I stab your tongue with a knife 'til it's bleeding words
I'm a wanksta
Motherfucking bitch, I'll thank you
Remember never say I'm a gangsta? (Now that's gangsta!)
Don't be mad that you got smacked, punched & slammed
This is all day, I ain't even got to touch you, man
What the plan?  Diss Proof and build your name
You ain't Pac or Big, but get killed the same
Along with Ja Rule, Benzino with any other people for that matter
Spread venom, Proof will come and see you
I stand where I stand, I am what I am
Ain't playing with a Stan, I'm a dangerous man
Don't care about nothing you say, nothing you do
We coming for you, get your guns and your crew
Got a plan in my mind, a clan on the rise
I tell you like this, I'm (?), goodbye

[Outro]
Tell you like this, this is it
All right
I'm through dissing Esham
Esham, you quit dissing me, man
You know what I'm saying?
I ain't even wasting any more time
Let's do it like this, acronym for your name
E.S.H.A.M.: Every Sucker Has A Moment
When you and your brother was on, y'all was on top then
It's over with
Give it up, nigga
No one more acid rap
Nobody wanna hear that bullshit you talking, all right
Man, nigga, first born
It ain't my fault there's another first born
On top of that, he's older than you
So he gotta be first born before you was a first born
Do the math on that shit and grow up nigga
You know what I'm saying?
Anybody else go and diss me, guess what?
I ain't even gonna respond
'Cause y'all gone think it's a little thing I do
I just sit down, beef with all them niggas
Hey, yo
Bring-bring that chorus

[Chorus]
I stand where I stand and I am what I am
And I'll be damned if I let a nigga get in my clan
(SO!)
I'll do me, fool, you do you
And all the loud mouth talking just WHOOPTIE WHOO!
I stand where I stand and I am what I am
And I'll be damned if I let a nigga get in my clan
(SO!)
I'll do me, fool, you do you
And all the loud mouth talking just WHOOPTIE WHOO!
