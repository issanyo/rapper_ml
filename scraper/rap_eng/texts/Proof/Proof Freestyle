[Intro: Proof]
Detroit! Uh
Big Proof!

[Verse]
D12, strong arm, with my gun drawn
With your step pop's ass in fronting on your mom's lawn
A sick bandit, trying to kill this planet, die alone
You're one tired [?], your blown like a firestone
I'm a quiet stone, when I'm high and stoned
Trying to buy a home that makes Mariah moan
This battle shit, I mastered it
So sign your p-roll
For your life, only say half of it
Bastard bitch
P, picture perfect, pulverise a pagan
Pussy, pills, pencil pass my play pen
P's punch is powerful, precision me for [?]
Punish pranks for practice, for P is for Proof
Ha, y'all hustled before, but not grind
Got holes in my pockets, but never drop dimes
My rock sign's an ibis, our ice is deep too
My name is Max, and it's so nice to meet you
I stay at Point Blank range, because I doubt your aim
Bust a $5 ass, and I count the change
You ain't got the Malcolm brains, just look at us start
You was born with no balls, I was born with no heart

[Outro]
What! Trouble Soon (it's on)...
