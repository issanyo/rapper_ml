[Intro]
(kids laughing)
Deshawn, Kevin, what ya'll out here doing?
Lil baccarat? gimme my weed and take yo' ass home
What, ya'll bring yo' two lil big head ass's in here
And clean up this room
Now, god damnit! (door shuts)

[Dogmatic]
O.K. children, are you ready? (yes)

Oh, that's just my dad, when I talk shit he gets mad (arrgh)
I took his .44 mag, I put that mag in my bag
Took it to school, so I can blast all you faggots (arcade shot)
I think my teacher's on rag, cause when I'm in class
All that bitch do is just nag
Kevin do that, Kevin do this
I do what I wanna do, slut suck my dick!
I can school skip
I can put weed to my lips
I can pop E and take trips
I can flip scripts
Smack all the girls on they hips
Dress like a blood and yell, CRIP!
Steal daddy's Remy and take sips
Drink on the back of the porch and break shit
Break all the windows in dad's car and dip
Fuck stealing keys, ignitions get ripped

[Proof]
What am I grounded for?
Tell me one good reason
Moms is a dirty whore
Twice she been caught cheatin'
Why should I go to school?
You never went to school
Beating me with a broom
Just coz I bent the rules
I hate mom and dad, making me so sad
(Deshawn, clean up your room now!) No fag
No batch, so sad thinkin I'll mind you
Wanna kill you and hide you
Where nobody can find you
Time to curse you, for giving me curfew
Every time that you beat me
'Till my body purple
No, I won't listen mom
Why don't you shut your mouth?
School I've been missing out
Kids trying to punk me out
What I learn manners for?
Maybe you raised me wrong
All kids that graze me wrong
Get crazy play this song
Then can I have some friends
Make me come in to play
Dad always touch my skin
Now I'mma run away
