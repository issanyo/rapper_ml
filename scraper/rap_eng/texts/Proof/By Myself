Aha aha aha Runyan Ave

I can make it
By myself
I don´t need no help
From noone the else
Cause if I didn't make it
I'd have no wealth
I think i'd still be here
By Myself
I pray to God when I ever need help
Other than that I was
By myself
I did it by myself
By myself
I made it by myself
That´s why I'm by myself

So much pain it made me
Through the struggle to raise me
