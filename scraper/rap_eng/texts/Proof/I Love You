[Verse 1]
Listen to me for a change
It's been a minute since we kicked it last
Wave dollars when we holla'd at some tits and ass
I always spoke first and you listened last
In the not so distant past, we'd sit and laugh
Splittin half on the road to fame
So much pain shit I can't hold it man
I can't call it but know your name
A pity that in the same city we can't roll the same
Erasin' your health by hating yourself
Think about your life while you chasing its wealth
Wealth ain't worth losin you. You choose your  crew
I have time for one day of what we used to do
I could look in your eyes didn't see demons
Now I look in your eyes and empty dreams
Is it really that bad
You really that mad
Now I think you say anything for cash
But I love you

[Verse 2]
A loner touch stoner
Now Katika think that I don't want her?
Listen baby girl daddy's stressed out
But I'mma get my game together and stick my chest out
You feel left out
I know the feelin
In a run like my dad seemed so appealing
So tip to mom and tell her I'm comin
And Darcell on the real you a hell of a woman
And knowing that I love you Obie Trice
Cuz Sharonda you family with Sonya Rice
Four women and one cousin
That's why I praise Marshall for givin me one dozen
In this life you only need one cousin
I got no kick it tho for no jealous lovin
We fam and i gonna punch ya jaw
Just know that my heart be bump for ya'll
And I love you

[Verse 3]
Let me see where I left off
My house is tight
Now I gotta clean my steps off
I back every move that the dozen does
Undertaker we straight 'n for us it's love
If there's beef I don't care I know where to check
Einstein's my man and I can respect that
Akreem (?) it seems you hate me now
We friends till the end or until God take me out
Lola and Helluva, listen to the Big Pro
Don't bygone the unity when you get dough
Don't duck up the backdoor when you get low
That's what you big bro was here for
Dogmatic Raw C, Wit and Pep, S Cazza, Big Rick and Hex
Listen poor or rich we know bylaws
No matter what ya'll do ya'll still my dawgz
I love ya'll
