[Verse 1]
Me and my momma ain't close, daddy ghost like most
Only for the hood riches when we
Broke that we all toast
Got an awesome gang yesterday
My rhyme is just press and play
Born in this cold world, shit
That ain't no special day
Just a reminder, you get to thirty you lucky
Mother fucker that's the words of T Stuckey
Grew up on Put Stones and YBI
Mazaradi rig, why would I lie?
Good all die
Got a question your honour, listen
Whatever happened to that shit death before decider?
I'm on the tip why your flipping flopper G
Don't even know what he charged
When did he cop a plea?
Sloppily, shit this game did change
Niggas caught with a little work and
They start naming names
I'm blaming fame, Benz's, bitches and bling
In today's world y'all treat a
Fuckin snitch as a king
Switches my means of income,win
Some, go far, in come
All the broke niggas and did some
You can lose one battle but lose the war
My shoes is torn
From walking these dawgs
Damn I'm talking to y'all!
While you're not involved, just nodding along
I've got to ask the church
Shit, is God in the wrong?
And to You Mr. Preacher is God in the Wrong?
Y'all don't even hear me niggas
Your just nodding along

[Hook](Repeat X2)
I took this time to gripe
Hear this rhyme I write
Let me clearly define my life

[Verse 2]
Bubba Fats is the truth
The raps out of Proof
It's all steel like the gats that I shoots
Backwards I move from 86-88
Where there's chambers remain here with heavy weight
So much game around me
They drown me
In this sin city
I've been busy
Since sucking on my mommas thin titty
When is he stopping the world? God don't know
It's all a joke to him, watching how hard we grow
Death don't kissy you when god say it
Sort of like that little whistle in Broadway
Our way, Plant workers on lines, beeper stores
Health care, fuck potholes we got deeper sores
Reaped with wars
My man young to kill Patrick
Dexter is lovely ain't it? I'm still at it
I fill my hand with Mr. Man and Tone-Loc
When the lights burnt out in them grown folk
My bone broke
To lift this pen
Let me jot this down and get this in
When I'm gone I hope y'all respect me then
Let me jot this down and get this in
When I'm dead and gone I hope y'all respect me then
I'm gone

[Hook](Repeat X2)

[Outro: Dolo]
Yo man
I did a lot in my life, man
I'd buried a lot of niggas
A lot of posers went to jail
The streets are wicked out there
Fuck all the nightmares
Try my best
The only thing I left back there
It's all
My Life
