[Verse 1: Journalist 103]
I’ve been summoned to give you a hurting truth
So you bound to get addicted the second I’m in the booth
I think its bout time I get loose
So you can get a realisation in your mind of what a soldier can do
A trained professional, I studied the art of words
With the (??) of a predicate makes my actions superb
Take a breather I’m sprinting on jogging men
I’ve flown seventy miles and they ain’t close to my second win
Journalist ya hear it that’s one hell of a title
103’s the reason you join your choir recitals
Life signs get vital and violations I’m made to attack stews which pays when charging it to the game
In rap now-a-days, getting fucked is a common practise
If you know what I know best pack your prophylactic
Revolve your six shots I choose to be automatic
And lick a hot sixteen bars something to ride with

[Chorus: (Proof) & Journalist 103]
(You're getting broke up)
For fucking with killers out of your league
(Don't choke up)
For saying some shit that you didn't mean
(Glad you woke up)
Cus there's no way you could ever see a man living reality while you living the dream
(You're getting broke up)
For fucking with killers out of your league
(Don't choke up)
For saying some shit that you didn't mean
(Glad you woke up)

[Verse 2: Mu]
I’m just an average cat
Born in the back of a black hatchback with a (nap?) noting some wack rap
And if you can’t appreciate that then you can just scrap it out with this mac 10
I talk shit cus I can, pretty smart guy with ignorant friends and awfully quick with his hands man
In other words what I’m sayin, don’t ever fuck with a man with a match and aerosol cans stuck in his pants
Get a life, get a hustle, get a job, get a meal, get away from me, quit chasin me, get a deal
Girls tell me that I seem conceded, so here’s your confidence back, along with some game you seem to need it
I had a fag slapped cus he came up to me with his backpack, saying my albums was wack
Cus it wasn’t abstract, that’s that cat from before
He got mad cus he couldn’t take a picture with me after the show
I suggest you put your ego in check, we don’t make threats and hide behind a email address
Ask Hex we’ll find you, show up to your office out in Pineview and put a hole in ya, big enough to throw a swine through
I’m a first round draft pick, spittin fire at you half wits meltin plastic glasses to ashes
I can master any craft crafted, hotter than acid
Give me a beat and I’ll give you a classic

[Chorus: (Proof) & Journalist 103]
(You're getting broke up)
For fucking with killers out of your league
(Don't choke up)
For saying some shit that you didn't mean
(Glad you woke up)(9046824)
Cus there's no way you could ever see a man living reality while you living the dream
(You're getting broke up)
For fucking with killers out of your league
(Don't choke up)
For saying some shit that you didn't mean
(Glad you woke up)

[Verse 3: Proof]
Everybody light your lighters, Big Proof I write the rightest, snipe the biters
Blow your chest to bits, to get rid of you like P.E. did Professor Griff
Ain’t no (??) than the immortal warlord who gon' knock me down
Bitch I’ll make your punk ass fall off like Foxy Brown
Who gone stop me now, I’m doper than the veins on Bobby Brown
Twist a niggas neck round and round, pound for pound
No equivalent illegitimate mic stalkers make them shit a brick
Illiterate counterfeit style soakers
Please them with their mouths open
Flash! Now they mouth’s broken
The flame is hot the names is got to stop
The fame is not to sustain the spot to plot
In the battle Proof not name to drop
I’m iller than the trigger finger that was aimed at Pac

[Outro] X6
Heart being broken
Broken
Broken
