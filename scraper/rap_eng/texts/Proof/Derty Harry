[Intro]
Hey them horns ain't extensions nigga listen
Real shit here
Haha

[Verse 1]
Face to face you got no heart, when I blow sparks
You lean on me like Joe Clark, my mind is so dark
Your superficial, nuclear Missile
Hit your body and your bones and I loose the gristle
Proofs official, D12 trademarker
Male, no "S," big brave heart
Y'all ain't even listen
No S big backwards is Gibson
Mel Gibson bravehearted
Now on to my mission
And since then no failure
I promised God to commit homicide to niggas wantin a free ride
Like the Amistad, I'm alive
And just started Anger Management too, like [?]
Body ya mind, dyin' to ride like Ronnie and Cline
Influenced the greatest like Ronnie and Todd
It ain't no problem too hard
My solo like Do Lo, been gettin' it
Like I ain't been shittin' it!


[Hook]
(Y'all done start it)
Derty Harry
Contract mothafucker lets roll it right now!
(Y'all done start it)
Derty Harry
You the one on this
(Y'all done start it)
Derty Harry
Proof nigga I'm a wolf
(Y'all done start it)
Derty Harry
You can get some now!

[Verse 2]
In high school of course I was the best in the lunchroom
Don't make me get up out my seat bitch and punch you
I freestyle for fun but write for wealth
I'm so dope nigga even bite myself
I rap it with rapid fire
Blasting iron at a Baptist choir
And then at the black Messiah
We gat for hire to let the techs growl
Put something in your body worse then the West Nile
I was born out of test tube glass
I suggest you blast nigga
Or catch sum flesh wound fast
I ain't met a man that can wrestle gats
I'm right behind the top rappers like a Neptune track
Ya L.P., I slept through that
Now guess who back
Unless you strapped with a vest and two gats
I suggest you pack
I'll spread you flat then rescue rap
Hit your body so much that your flash won't match
Muthafucker!

[Hook]

Fuck Osama for bombing in the racing buildings
I'll bust him and hide him like Jason Williams
(I heard Bizzare and D12 be raping children!?)
Cut the hype dyke I'm trying to make a million
Take this pill then call me when you sober up
Turn the dyke from glad to groupies, make'em hold my nuts
Seldom-ly seen, Elvis the King
But it's Em that's got these kids nailed to the screen
I held the team, I-F
I got something on my chest thats hard to digest
I hear the streets talk and sing
Offering cause jacking my rapping
They mad cause I'm flossing bling
I lost my steam but a demon in human flesh hyped my up
Now my team is tightly cut
So sugar, sugar, salt, salt
If you didn't get off it's not my fault
The dog is back and y'all niggas!

[Hook]
