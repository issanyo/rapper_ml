[Intro Proof] –
Shady records, ain’t nobody better than us
Shady records, more cheddar than us
Shady records, ain’t nobody better than us
Shady records…

[Eminem]
I done figured this rap shit out, I map shit out strategically
Timing is everything, and it seems to be the key
To my success, I merked for me repeatedly
(GreenLantern) “The evil genius”
We done be, to beat MC’s
Timing is everything, and it seems to be the key
Let 'em diss you first and respond immediately
In order to master, the art of war, don't start a war
Shit, not no more; we done scared 'em off, there are no more
Victims to sick; I'm fixin' to pick some and start shit
Ain’t got no pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at
Ain't got no more targets, shit, Irv and Jeff
We done beat 'em to death, Benzino in debt
There seems to just be no one left to bully; Bush is pussy
Why the fuck you think his name's Bush? Puss is bushy!
Ain't shit going on, shit, I've been getting so bored lately
I'm thinking of doing some shit to get you to go and hate me again
Tell the truth, I liked the shit better then, shit, I could spit better
I'm 'bout to kick this sick shit again, look:
The game just ain't the same, it's changing
Shit, Dre is quitting, Jay is quitting, now it's just wankstas
Just saying the same shit, it's fake and it's ancient
And It's making me so bored I'mma just make a new language
Fubba-u-cubba-kubba yubba obubba ubba
You-ba can subbabick my dadibbadick through a tuba!
Summa dumma lamma I'm not a human, I'm a suicidal supersonic
Suicidal Unabomber
You think I'm the new Osama, press thinks I'm the new Madonna
Jeffrey Dahmer left me with this legacy to carry on
A lot of talk and rumors on us, who's the hottest? To be honest
Hip hop ain't been the same since 2Pac moved to Cuba on us
[Outro Konartist] – Shaddy records, they ain’t better than us
Shaddy records, they ain’t making more cheddar than us
Shaddy records, they ain’t better than us
Shaddy records, muthafuckas more cheddar than us
