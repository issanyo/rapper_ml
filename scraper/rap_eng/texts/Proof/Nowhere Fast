[Intro]
Ayo
Yo, you recording me?
You got me with?–
Aight, listen here
It's Promatic
Salam Wreck, Murder Man
You can bet yo' ass it's gonna be on the Promatic album
We're gonna put our heart out here for y'all, you know what I'm sayin'?
See how this game beat us, man
It's that serious shit
(We gonna make it sound fresh, huh?)
Now, listen to me

[Verse 1: Proof]
I been doin' this shit so long, the game is sayin' "So long"
I'm tryin' to prolong and hold on (Hold on)
And grow strong, and Nasaan, Nyeem, Kativa, and Shaun
Some don't long, you don't know me, homie, roll on
You don't know this game owe me, but won't get credit
I feel lonely, pathetic, if only I'd let it get to me
I'm history; no gimmick, this is me
I never go to clubs to fight, but I fight at clubs
Wrong than a motherfucker, homies say I'm right as fuck
With the might I thug, with the Midas touch
Slap the butts of the sluts, 'cause they fine as fuck
My mind is stuck–yo, I think I rhyme DeShaun, collect dough
And kick it with flows, when I really love to travel
With Promatic, my niggas who visit with flows
Me and Stuckey share the same dream, Trick-Trick the same
And Royce, he got beef stuck in his brain
My family, one thing to tell ya
Sicknotes, 'Matic, and D12, y'all only hurt me with failure
I tell ya

[Hook: Proof]
I ain't goin' nowhere fast (They don't believe in me)
Only tryin' to get this cash (Why there's weed in me)
Everybody doubt my dreams (Treat me so wrong)
Think I'm only out for creed (So fuck all y'all)
I ain't goin' nowhere fast (They don't believe in me)
Only tryin' to get this cash (Why there's weed in me)
Everybody doubt my dreams (Treat me so wrong)
Think I'm only out for creed (So fuck all y'all)

[Verse 2: Dogmatic]
Yo, do you, dog, and I'ma do me, dog
'Matic's the name, I'm hangin' rappers from trees, y'all
Kevin and Proof is through with just makin' excuses
We'll beat you profusely with what I write in my loosely
Don't try to confuse me, I'm sayin' I'm not hot
You got nothin' to do with me, so stay off my jock
Born potent to smokin' rocks, it's me, Kevin Bennion
Since seventh grade I been crazy, but I never been lazy
I stay in the lab with Pep, Went, and DeShaun
Yeah, breakin' yo' ass so long, wreckin' yo' moms
I'ma stay on, 'cause this game just prays on
Young rappers that don't know this shit don't stay long

[Interlude: Dogmatic]
It's the game, baby
But you know, it's like
You gotta be in it to win it, baby
And we all the way in it
Promatic for life, nigga
Sicknotes, D.O.G., baby
Get it crackin', Promatic

[Hook: Proof]
I ain't goin' nowhere fast (They don't believe in me)
Only tryin' to get this cash (Why there's weed in me)
Everybody doubt my dreams (Treat me so wrong)
Think I'm only out for creed (So fuck all y'all)
I ain't goin' nowhere fast (They don't believe in me)
Only tryin' to get this cash (Why there's weed in me)
Everybody doubt my dreams (Treat me so wrong)
Think I'm only out for creed (So fuck all y'all)
