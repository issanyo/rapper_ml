[Intro: Eminem]
Guess who, New shit!
D12 World, D-Twizzy!

[Hook: Eminem]
You don't got a reason and don't want no beef
You ain't got no ends to justify the means
You don't got a cause, you better put it on pause
You don't got the balls to fit in them draws
So whatever it is you thinking that's got you gassed
You better start rethinking and thinking it fast
Ain't nobody told you, homie, ya wanna ask
You better pump them brakes and let off the gas (Swift)
And slow your roll

[Verse 1: Swift]
Sinister, a menace to many, I'm not friendly
You get shot in a Kennedy fashion
Pop willingly you walking around with Pac's identity
I'm a mockery you 'bout to watch what it's fin to be
I'm not mentally focused but lyrically we got it locked
And it's not about dropping albums, I'll sock a nigga on the spot
You can't help it but to imagine this walking massacre
A madman strapped with a Magnum blow that spasm out ya back
And just stand there and snatch your medallion
See I can't fear any nigga that can not happen
The immaculate Mac handler
That got this wrapping by the back of his neck
A scavenger I'm a threat then you feel me
Like a hand full of syringes
I'm ill enough to scream at your front do'
Blow it off the hinges (nigga)
I'm marksmatic, depressed marksman outta walking
'Cause soon your body they catch me shooting up your carcass
So don't provoke shit, I wish the whole
Mankind was a neck so I can choke it
Ferocious and you ain't gonna be knowing where ya folks is
Fuck the milk cartons and posters, it's over, they ghosts (hey)

[Verse 2: Proof]
Niggas is bitch instead of digging a ditch
I'ma see how filled this river can get even bitches get hit
I'm raw dog on all fours, I'm barking with long claws
Just fight for the wrong cause
Your boss with thong drawers (oh no)
You ain't in my bracket bitch, following faggots
With wanksta tats on their ass, see ya
[Eminem backwards:] Magic Stick If I get hit once you get hit twice
These scrubs need to do what he love and just play the back
Before I'll put a sword on ya head like a Raider cap
You bust I'm spraying back, leave your hood laying flat
Now what you gonna say to that?

[Hook: Eminem]
You don't got a reason and don't want no beef
You ain't got no ends to justify the means
You don't got a cause, you better put it on pause
You don't got the balls to fit in them draws
So whatever it is you thinking that's got you gassed
You better start rethinking and thinking it fast
Ain't nobody told you, homie, ya wanna ask
You better pump them brakes and let off the gas (Bizarre)
And slow your roll

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
Pull up new county truck, throw up, blow up, beat a handicap bitch up
Fuck butter I killed the DJ
I don't need you, bitch, I got a instant replay
Lay down bitch get butt naked
And fuck the Viagra I'm trying to nut in two seconds
All around the world, fuck wit' different cliques
You ain't got no weed get the fuck out my room bitch

[Verse 4: Kuniva]
I'm calm but I steal on niggas like I was klepto
Put that chrome shit to ya head like you was Destro
Why stop niggas, why not pop niggas, we cop figures
Keep them toast like IHOP nigga, we breathe dirt so be alert
Or get them guns on ya chest like a welcome to the hood T-shirt
Let's go back before throw backs, before I dro sacks
I used to blow gats, bullets'll find you like a low jack
I'm hopeless, a ferocious dosage of dope shit
A culprit of culture and a chaotic commotion
Kuniva will blow shit off of the map and post it
Knock you out of your penny loafers, fuck that ho shit

[Hook: Eminem]
You don't got a reason and don't want no beef
You ain't got no ends to justify the means
You don't got a cause, you better put it on pause
You don't got the balls to fit in them draws
So whatever it is you thinking that's got you gassed
You better start rethinking and thinking it fast
Ain't nobody told you, homie, ya wanna ask
You better pump them brakes and let off the gas
And slow your roll

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
I point my fingers to the ground, throw my waist to left of me
To knuckle should ship like a Em upside down and you best be
On your p's and q's people we sees to use
No one see's your views, so now you see's exclusives
And put it in your little magazine, but you should
Know that was the most desperate thing that you could
Pull out of your crotch you faggots all owe us much
Start doing heroin lines for as much as you gossip
Like bitches with Oscars, y'all actresses
45's make bodies flip like flabby tits
Bullets coming at your doom like a buck up 6th
Now what the fuck you gonna do to get up out of this shit?
Your record was released 17 years ago you dumb bitch
Do the math, you'll never have a Shady/Aftermath Runyon Ave
Kind of staff to back that ass up so back that ass up
Before we clap that ass up

[Hook: Eminem]
You don't got a reason and don't want no beef
You ain't got no ends to justify the means
You don't got a cause, you better put it on pause
You don't got the balls to fit in them draws
So whatever it is you thinking that's got you gassed
You better start rethinking and thinking it fast
Ain't nobody told you, homie, ya wanna ask
You better pump them brakes and let off the gas
And slow your roll

[Outro: Kon Artis]
Nigga you better ask somebody
These niggas think they can just put shit
Out on their own, fuck them
