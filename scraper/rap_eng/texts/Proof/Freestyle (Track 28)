[Verse 1: Kuniva]
Yo, it's Kuniva, I'll cuss hoes out, like a drunk sailor
And cock the hammer back, like Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor
You best be on your best behavior before I slay ya
And watch the video of your life with your Lord Savior
I can go in off your mom, they get along when they see the gun
And Dirty Dozen cross my arm and it ain't a secret, get scared
And be nervous, ‘cause I'ma be in jail in a cell with C-Murder
Shady is a general, a soldier form I showed it to him
He saved my life, I owe it too him, so compare it to anybody
I serve you on a platter, your words dont even matter
You all you leavin' badder
I'm a hazard without bowl and loop doop
I shoot through people at super markets
While they ringin' up your fruit loops
You challengers get pushed off banisters
I'm unavoidable like anvals, droppin' on toon characters

[Verse 2: Swifty]
I'm the freak slasher, chop bodies up in meat packer
I reach back for the necks, choppin' your feet faster
Than Steven King, I repeatedly beat bastards
The pops for result of havin' a meet in maggots
When I see faggots, put three in they fleece jackets
You bleed rapid, poppin' all in your lead actors
Speed and acids when I mourn, didn't even ask for it
Technique's hazardous, you needin' Jesus of Nazereth
To see what's happenin', means havin' your teeth chatterin'
Speak battlin', heat splatter your peeps abdomin
Sweet fashion, I reload and I keep blastin'
I breathe action, if you dont believe ask him

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I'm sick of bitches, man, I done heard enough shit
Talk a lot of mouth like they wanna do it
Then they pull down they pants and then I shoot fluid
Then they start runnin', screamin' like they God called them
And I called them back and then pulled a crackin' in
Stick my dick up in and make them rap again
They wanna rap for me and tell me that they love me
Kon Artis, you're my daddy and I dont wanna be your hubby
I can't be your hub, baby, I ain't gettin married
I'm stand fuckin' bitches, it really very scary
My lil cousin named Terry told me that I fucked him too long
And then I gotta get a Jerry curl to make 'em all keep drippin'
You niggas know I never really be trippin', my beats bang
Make ears bleed through Walkman's
That's why people ignore you like you ain't even talkin'
You chit chatter and get splattered by a disease beat addict
That spit spontanious, like a Prayin Mantis, I cut you off
Pickin' that gang green, your man seen how I get ignorant
By losin' my spleen, the truth of the seen as soon as my team
Get on, we rule cities like 'Zila through Hong Kong
You wanna knew, you wanna know
You gotta ask my man Proof how the fuck the flow goes

[Verse 4: Proof]
Pull it back, pull it back, pull it back, pull it back
We ain't wentin' no where, we sippin' Champagne
Shady Records, ain't nobody better than us
Shady Records, no chedder than us
Shady Records, ain't nobody better than us
Shady Records, I got your ears goin'
Like it's sparkles in my rhymes
Hotter than a felon in a carload full of 9's
Got the sparkles out to shine, get your back up
And get your dollars out your spines
Because the head is ill, I'm in love with Natasha Betinville
Yo, faster than a Porsche
Make you disappear, like advertisement in The Source
So do it, baby, I want the sugar, baby
My sift from the rabies
Yo, Proof, D12, is on the haitus, on a scale from 1-10
I'm an 8, wait, you don't know how 8 is, 8 is Jigga
That's me, 9 is Slim, 10 is Slim, now I finally give you
The time I give you to Bom Artis has got promise
And me and Proof and Swift and the Kon Artis
And it ain't over, boy, who you beef with, trust me
I'll tell you Puffy and you can lose big, ‘cause it's that
Face it, I'm a brick face, you get it laced with a switch blade
Yo, I stab you with a mixtape
Tell your girl, ask her how my dick taste
I told you once before that I'm a brick face
I'm a big and I shine, plus I spit mace
Make all the bad boys that's missin' listen up
Yo, next on this transition, and you know how it is
And you know when it's gravy
Next up, chigga-chigga Slim Shady

[Verse 5: Eminem]
I done figured this rap shit out
I map shit out strategically
Timing is everything and that seems to be the key
To my success, it's worked for me repeatedly
Let 'em diss you first, and respond immediately
In order to master the art of war, don't start a war
Shit, not no more, we done scared 'em off, there are no more
Victims to sic, I'm fixin' to pick some and start shit
Ain't got no pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at
Ain't got no more targets, shit, Irv and Jeff
We done beat 'em to death, Benzino in debt
There seems to just be no one left to bully, Bush is pussy
Why the fuck you think his name's Bush? Puss is bushy
Ain't shit goin' on, shit, I been gettin' so bored lately
I'm thinkin of doin' some shit
To get you to go and hate me again
To tell the truth, I liked the shit better then
Shit, I could spit better, I'm 'bout to kick this sick shit again
Look, the game just ain't the same, it's changin'
Shit, Dre's quittin', Jay's quittin'
Now it's just wangstas just sayin' the same shit
It's fake and it's ancient
It's makin' me so bored, I'ma just make a new language
Fubba you cubba kubba, yubba yub yubba yooba
Yooba can subbabick my dubbibbabick through a tooba
Summaladoomalama
I'm not a human, I'm a suicider supersonic suicidal unabomber
You think I'm the new Osama
Press thinks I'm the new Madonna
Jeffery Dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on
A lot of talk and rumors honest
"Who's the hottest?" – to be honest
Hip-hop ain't been the same since 2Pac moved to Cuba on us

[Outro: Proof]
Ayo, Shady Records, ain't nobody better than us
Shady Records, ain't gettin' more cheddar than us
Shady Records, ain't nobody better than us
Shady Records, muh'fucka, more cheddar than us
