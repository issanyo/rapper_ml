[Verse 1: Proof]
I used to wonder where you’re from
Cause every time I saw you, you’d always play dumb
But now I know who you are
The ghetto candy; the neighborhood star
I’m not the type to be in heat
Just waiting for the day that you and I could meet
You’re the one that’s always fly
Never giving me a smile just a plain old hi
They say that Proof is from another place
I got the juice, wanna taste?
I know you can be happy
I know you can love a man that’s nappy
And it ain’t in my methods
But I can visualize you naked
The soulful stacks of vibes
You wanna follow me? Close your eyes
Cause I be

Searching, searching, searching, searching
Cause I’m just
Searching, searching, searching, searching
You know I be
Searching, searching, searching, searching
Cause I’m just
Searching, searching, searching, searching

[Verse 2]
Ask myself where you’re at
You be by the laundromat, headphones bumping feedback
First let me explain my name
I know it sounds the same (Yes it does)
(far from active?) you’re attractive
Let me get your bra size, your name, and your address
Keep the convo, wasn’t like she had time fo'
A bro like me
So I’mma go through what I know
Our relations became soft no hold up
Interrupted when my pager blows up
Made my way to the payphone
Turned around astound like that she’s gone
So now I’m

Searching, searching, searching, searching
Cause I’m just
Searching, searching, searching, searching
You know I be
Searching, searching, searching, searching
Cause I’m just
Searching, searching, searching, searching

[Verse 3]
Eyo, she’s out of touch; a new orbit
I heard she did a gig at this club called the Orchid
I’m in the place to be but the place to be
Was called Heaven, and oh boy, I couldn’t wait to see
There’s no time like showtime
And on the center stage was the hold of mind so divine
Her trick name was secret, her nickname was silence
By chance we clapped hands, she lapdanced
She looked me in the eye
Took her hand to the inner thigh―Why?
Stripping ain’t that much
But there’s a difference between a dancer and 'haha'
But still, I got the number and we kicked it
But she ain’t the type I really want to visit
We got involved, it’s not working
Ask me who’s down, I don’t know because I’m still

Searching, searching, searching, searching
Cause I’m just
Searching, searching, searching, searching
You know I be
Searching, searching, searching, searching
Cause I’m just
Searching, searching, searching, searching
