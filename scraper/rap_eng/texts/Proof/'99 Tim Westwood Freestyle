[Intro]
Blastin' off(Aw yeah!)
Yo, I'm sayin' though, you understand what's going on London?

[Pre-Performance Ad-Libs]
One two, one two
One two, one two, one two
Y'all done started something that you can't undo
Yo, yo

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm up in the spot with Tim Westwood
You wanna step to this? You better use your best foot
Flawless freestyles I drop right off the top
Take a bottle of beer and bite off the top
Right of the block, straight to your neighbourhood
The flavor's good in London and I'ma stay for good
Yo, check it out, it's Slim Shady
I rip the radio right off of the S baby
Y'all can't see me 'cause y'all don't wanna even be it
Y'all don't understand these freestyles when I MC it
Original bad boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place, blowed and sprayed Puffy with mace
I lace the weed with insect repellent, better check the smelly
Eminem starts with E, better check the spellin'
With a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped on my Adam's apple
Somebody dropped me on my head and I'm for sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was 6 months
And said I'm ready now bitch, ain't you feeling these kicks, cunt?
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you're sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
Hit you in the head with a brick till you plummet
If y'all don't like me you can suck my dick till you numb it
And all the gibberish you were spittin', you need to kill it
'Cause your style is like dying in my sleep, I don't feel it
And any MC that try to step to this I'll throw you right off of the roof
Ayo, bust it Proof!

[Verse 2: Proof]
One of a kind and I come with the time
Having fun with the rhyme until I'm done with your mind
Listen, now every MC got a story
Well mine is me and my story is an [?] before me
I'm sorry [?] the style to be proved
Ayo since Big Daddy Kane fell off they don't know how to be smooth
Yo, I seen a fat rodent walk in with Paul Rosen
With a gat in holding, talking 'bout he DeShaun Holton
It's the same thing, we bust when it come through
With Tim Westwood, your best foot forward
Can't do that, here it is, put your good foot
We mack y'all, like y'all was some hoes on Wood wood
No time for that, flatbacks when you rap, counterattack
With a battle axe, you collapse from them whack raps
You try to spit to me, I make you all know I'm a genius
A [?]
Come back holding my―yo, no need to cuss, bust (penis!)
Yo we can't say that keep it the cleanest, the meanest
Slim Shady, next thing it was my fault
Y'all caught outlined in chalk, incredible as the Hulk
While I settle for [?], it's the P-R-letter O
Sex is hetero, cash more checks than federal, you better know
How you feel about they got a dope cheddar flow
And my man Dee Teezy, straight from Stress magazine
Bag a scene, we drag your queen
Like she's a man dressed up, how you feel you get pressed up
Left up, it's time for that P-R-O-O, you get F'd up
Yeah it's time for that mind combat
Next up my man Slim Shade when we rhyme at

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Last night I OD'd on rush, mushrooms and dust
And rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
Shucks, I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I've called in to work cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol 3 and talk about how violent I'll be
Give me 11 Excedrin and my head will spin
Medicine will get me reving like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls till I shred the skin
Doctor check this rash, look how red it's been
It's probably AIDS, forget it then
I'll strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That don't even make sense like dykes using dildos
So reach in your bill folds for 10 duckets
And pick up the Slim Shady stuff that's on Rawkus
Some'n some'n some'n some'n, I can't read it
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it

[Verse 4: Proof]
Ayo, the truth hurt when Proof hurt
Move the whole Earth beneath your feet just like loose dirt
So F your politics if you swallow, feel the hollow tips rip
Through your collar disc, learn your knowledges
Then burn your colleges, I touch your grill
With the skill of a dermatologist, your turn to follow this
Acknowledge this head cracker, ho smacker
Whack rapper attacker, internet hacker
No slacker, best factor, Midwest bracket
Yeah you know about it, it's us on your jacket
DJ Headscratcher like a hatchet, who can match it?
Make you go-go like Gadget, perform magic
Without a wand, I drop bombs without Saddam
A vet' without 'Nam, I make sense without common ground
I'm still down y'all with my first crew
You got a fly style, I down that just like curfew
Yo I'm worth two ears and a mind full of attention
Plus I'm CEO of the whack MC prevention
Listen to the real gift over ill riffs
Cause you on the mic, me and Em aren't tryna hear like Will Smith
Your career's not over with, come here to cope a spit
We heat the sub y'all before the supernova hit
I know the truth, so now I’m baring all
I make R. Kelly confess he stole his first style from Aaron Hall
A whack MC with a gun, I'm not one
And when see Kurt Cobain tell him "bring back my shotgun"
I got one style for all y'all bazooka
Ayo if I was 2Pac I'd come back from Cuba
Rhyme with me when I push on her tooters
Tryna get wild and then we bust like Lugers
Me and my man Slim Shady, we pen great-y
Take our 80 MC's, West you know what, what
What, what, what, what
What

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Yo yo yo
One more time I come back
Slinging the wack, yo
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Senior
And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a messed up childhood, that I use as an excuse
And ain't nothing changed, I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Pfft, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowing mine out
Forget it, you only live once you might as well die now

[Verse 6: Proof]
Yeah, best do like it is
Roll your tape recorders, we came to the London borders
Walk in a caster store, put on a master score
Blast your four, then I trash your store
Your woman start to scream so I stab your whore
Jet out your door faster than a Labrador
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 7: Eminem]
Smoking herb and still we spit
On this microphone, they say I'm allowed to say 'shit'
So I'ma say it as much as I can
Cause it don't matter cause I'm the man
With a fricking beer in my hand
I said frick cause I was respect to Tim Westwood
Y'all wanna step to this, yo I come from the best hood
Detroit, the Motown, where it goes down
Kick the flow sound, rappers they know now
But kick a pro now

[Verse 8: Proof]
Back and forth, me and Em don't need to practice
Y'all lack this, we stick you like a cactus
You scream like a actress, the fact is
Y'all can't see us in '99, 2000
3000, 4000 arousing styles

[Verse 9: Eminem]
And 3 plus, y'all wanna be us
But none of y'all can see us
Even if y'all had some new bifocals, I try locals
So y'all die [?] cause I smoke you
Plus I provoke you and then I bust
Freestyles y'all can't trust, I'm like Canibus
I bust, can I bust? No you can't
Well yes I can cause I'm Slim Shady and I'm the man

[Verse 10: Proof]
We flex styles like a bicep
I found out where Canibus money went
I borrowed a dollar from Wyclef
Rhyme deaf MC's need to try this
You can't get with this, make you one of my
Plus that, we bust back, yo F that
Rap that, step up and get flat
And it's time for y'all to hear what this year's around
Detroit been quiet long enough
Yo Slim, I need you to back me up
My freestyles ain't connecting
They better start respecting

[Verse 11: Eminem]
Well I'ma check then with dirty needles
It's two of us but we're not the Beatles
Cause there was three of them, and I am seeing them
But yall ain't seeing Em even if I was driving in the BM in the PM
With the top up and the top down, don't matter cause I rock now
Yo y'all can hear the Glock sound, 2Pac now
Yo that's what I am when I bust, this lyrical image
Y'all can't just betray the scrimmage
That I be killing when I be busting and I'm crushing
Any MC leave em with no freaking discussion

[Verse 12: Proof]
Run up in your house then I shot your wife
Ayo Em, hold these Tylenol 3's while I rock the mic

[Verse 13: Eminem]
Weed lacer, ninty-seven burgundy blazer
Wanted for burgulary, had to ditch the mercury Tracer
I'm on some loc shit, some fed up with this being broke shit
I'm not to joke with, yo I don't sell crack, I smoke it

[Break]
Aight?
Blastin' off, aight?
We blastin' off right now, London!
Tim Westwood baby, you don't understand right now!
We bombing the whole land on some Vietnam shit yo!
Where we [?] yo!

[Verse 14: Eminem]
Hand me an .8, beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world and spit on Brandy and Ma$e
I'm more than ill, scarier than a white person
Trapped in a room with Lauryn Hill, human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me
Cause I'ma still be Madd Rapper, whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddling, makin fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back-striking a Ford
And you wonder what the hell I need more Vicodin for
Everybody's pissing me off; even the No Limit Tank
Looks like a middle finger sideways flipping me off
No duh I'm a great danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in the grave and bury myself?
You can hate me now

[Verse 15: Proof]
Need to run for cover
Eminem is white but he still my brother
Slim Shady, known to go and smoke crack
But you and Charli Baltimore got something in common, you both whack
How you feel about that? No need to jock 'em
You so whack you make Master P sound like Rakim
When it's time to bust y'all, when we trust y'all, we dust y'all
Who y'all? Break your balls like cue balls
I know who you are, you RuPaul
Do stall, for those try to fall and try to brawl
All y'all get bust up and banged up, framed up
How many MC's bring my name up?
The same slut said the same thing, it's freestyle
No need to rehearse, my verse is universal
Curse a flow, crush you like Hershel Walker
Allie Sparker, three day sparker highland Parker chalker
You MCs can't get darker than the Midwest bracket
It's us, me and Emzee
Come right there, we feeling flimsy
Tipsed up, one time lifetime we ripped up
It's bad to the evil, met that, now it's all to say
Death rap, fuck hoes, don't even say get blast away, passed away
Blasted ass, hey yo, they say we're Aftermath
Slim Shady, you heard that, my words black
But bust you up because you preferred that
To hear me now, preferred that, the surgical snipe
Preserved you with life, I'll make you allergic to life
You die for this, don't even battle us
See us at the―what's that?―Subterreanean
We knock your brain in

[Outro]
Flows are hmm delly-lah like Arabian!
(Proof mimicking Arabian speech)
Ayo, ayo
We don't wanna hear that best white rapper, we be talking 'bout
Best rapper
Get all that out, you know what I'm sayin' ?
No doubt, never
Blastin' off
Explosions left and right(left and right)
This is legendary(Legendary)
Legendary!(Remember this show!)
This is John Lennon, this is John Lennon, legendary
Remember this show
History, baby
We on some John Lennon
Blowin', blowin'
We blowin' the spot right now London
Where it's war yo!
Blowin'!
It doesn't even matter

Cmon Tim Westwood
