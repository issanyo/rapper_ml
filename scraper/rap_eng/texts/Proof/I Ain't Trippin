[Intro]
Ey yo, it's dedicated to all my homies from my past
You know what I'm sayin'
If you going in life
Hey, just listen

[Verse 1]
Ayo what make you think in a blink we ain't fam no more
I guessed the same shit they say I ain't the man no more
I played no more the grieve 'cause you're frustrated
You see me on the new ride and you must hate it
Let me tell you what's over me, where I've been
Keep you in focus while I share my sins
I had a son real young, now let's trace back
Put my faith in this music, and chose to chase rap
I left him fatherless, never bothered with facin' him
Gotta deal with the drama, others momma raisin' 'em
Ten years later, my girl tummy is fat
At the bottom of the barrel with my gun in my lap
Had to hustle for rent, put muscle in strength
Had to borrow a pimp for dollars and sex
It's a wonder why my blood even pump at all
Yo no matter what y'all think, my heart pumps for y'all

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for sayin' that, I ain't trippin' man
I love you though Proof, I ain't trippin' man
We still dawgs though right? I ain't trippin' man
You been real distant, but I ain't trippin man

[Verse 2]
My situation ain't improvin', in fact, I'm still [?]
Paid my dues and still losing, walk in my shoes then
First son passed, the second one is here now
Confused, reaching for the weed and all the beer now
Never rep for self, try to live for all
But you didn't appreciate the real time I given y'all
Is it y'all that you don't want it and flaunt it in rhymes?
You are my path for this cash seen hundred at time
It's crazy with the bullshit, y'all addressing me
When every real man makes out his own destiny
You know that saying I depressed you, neglect you and left you
Sharp minds, no harp wires, that respect's due
I had to get my thought on, through the drama brought on
I feel y'all 'cause I slept on Em when he got on
When pressure's above, there's no justice for scrubs
Y'all was thicker than water but not less than blood
I can't believe y'all deceived me behind my back
Flipping for fame, damn where you mommy at?
Put the time with Zac still gon' hug y'all
No matter you think my niggas I love y'all

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for sayin' that, I ain't trippin' man
I love you though Proof, I ain't trippin' man
We still gon' be dawgs though right, I ain't trippin' man
You been real distant, I ain't trippin man

[Verse 3]
It's easy to express all my pain with ink
Who held you down with love, if you brain would think
The fame will wink and the game extinct
It's plain and bleak that I came in peace (Peace)
But the love heal, my love kill
This love give, shit or this love still
Is your love fake, or is your love real?
Anyway fakin' luck and he be gettin' the bill
When you lose trust you lose light true
Through my consciousness is that of a confused Christ
I choose right and obey your decision
But you need to be men and just play your position
My flesh is sacred committed by God
If I'm livin' large, shit's likewise for the whole squad
My body is a temple, it simple to read it
If the Lord don't give it, then I must not need it
The world is cold, don't be afraid nigga
Don't let the fame fuck your brain, I ain't payin' nigga
Still got a thug for scrilla
No matter what you do and say your thing, shit I love y'all niggas, c'mon

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for sayin' that there, I ain't trippin' man
I love you though Proof, I ain't trippin' man
We still dawgs though right, I ain't trippin' man
You been real real distant, but I ain't trippin man
I didn't mean to really say that, I ain't trippin' man
Can we shake on that? I ain't trippin' man
Somebody robbed [?] records, I ain't trippin man
Sorry for sayin' that, but I ain't trippin' man
