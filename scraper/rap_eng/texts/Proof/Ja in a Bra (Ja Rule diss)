D12, Sick Notes!
Its war now! Lets man up! (WOOF)
No prisoners! No casualties! All my riders lets ride then! CMON!

[Verse 1: Proof]
Word on the street is I murdered this INC
Your wack with your hands, not deserving the heat
Your nervous in beef, to Irv and his peeps
I ain't rapping no more
I speak through the curb in the streets
Ya henchman got this bitch to get a poor job
That makes the Cookie Monster
Hanging from a door knob
Ya lucky I don't like touching women
And don't send no peace talks
Coming through Russel Simmons
Got the right connections, mic conceptions
Yo, with beef you sleep
Your life is definately GONE...
Don't ever seep at least a woof of rap
You'll need more than a Bush
Attack to push me back
You think it's just 50 and Sha
Listen up Ja, no kissing or not
Detroit city wishin you die
I know you wanna just rap and be pop
But before it's said and done
Your gonna see Pac

[Hook: Proof]
Ya'll don't want war, ya'll want talk
In the dark my doggs all bark like ROOF
Proof nigga, I'm a wolf
Got you all shook
About to get your brains pushed back

[Verse 2: Proof]
Chris Gotti
This nigga had the nerve
To have 10 niggas sneek me
Just to get wit me
I'm only 160, and the fact is
Murder INC is Dj's and kittens
I only walked out with scratches
Wearing a Rolex Shirt
So if thats your streets speaking
Your threats don't hurt
You cowards, do something before we do ours
I could write a Ja Rule album in two hours
Right down on your back, run your pockets flat
Like federal tax, put your head on a rack
It's so bad, only be good is death
In LA, G Unit Posted and Suge Left
Fat Bitch
I'm from Detroit, went to holla in Hollis
Niggas is like "Ja's garbage, don't even bother"
Plus your over, gangstas is ?
50 made wanksta
And wanksta's definition is ain't tough
With bitches with ya'll wanna
Brawl with a paint brush
Painting his war marks
I'm losing my patience
It ain't just D12 and Obie
Homie cancel your shows, respect
And act like you know me
If you say Hailies name again, I'm catching a jet
911 style, to your face and your chest
911 style, to your face and your chest
It's over nigga getting wet on the set

[Hook]

[Outro: Proof]
Ha.. I Ain't Even Talkin No More
I Can't Believe My Name Came Out Your Ho Ass Mouth Nigga
