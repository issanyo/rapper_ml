[Intro]
It's Proof man. (Eh yo) I did write this on paper I'd like to send to y'all, but I said fuck it I might as well capture it right?
(Hip hop, hip hop...)
I don't really express my love for homies that much so.. when I feel the need to I do, you know how it is!

[Verse 1: Proof]
Dear Paul even though you may think small of love songs
This is my apology for everything I done wrong
In the past my ego was huge, you dealt with it
For that I send you long life and health with it
You was my attorney to be, manager, and friend
Seen a star in me before the camera run lens
To think back and see that you were my approve through the struggle with Mark Hicks and damn I fired you? (What?)
From now to then I see where all my troubles been
But I'm living out my dream thanks to you and Double M
I love him like you from Kim to daughter a party sure it goes down, we're poor (In the water!)
Your test number was 313 look where it led to
I see it in your face yeah I miss Ed too
We a family to stay together
Yeah we don't pray together but this how its gone be everyday forever
(I love you)

[Hook: Proof]
This my love letters, to all my people before cheddar, no vendettas right now lets settle
This my love letters
To poor Rosenberg
This my love letters, to all my people before cheddar, no vendettas right now lets settle we out to get em
This my love letters
To D12
To my love letters, (to) I love y'all (from the heart come on)

[Verse 2: Proof]
Dear Nani it seems lately you seem shaky, you need to slow down, remember HP?
When we was broke with no vision, now you got a little money and try to make everybody's decisions
Listen if it ain't for the team nigga I ain't with it
Ain't no money out here solo and Proof can't get it
But I think of Vocaz, Swifty and Vizzi and how as a unit our pockets been empty
And put simply, sometimes you need a hug dude
Look what you doing that nigga Von shit he love you!
From the struggle to success I love you to death. Out the crew me who rumble out of stress
Nah, think about that that's something to grow to
Trials in life is something we all must go through
We all got your back with our rapping so true
But, without D12 my nigga its no use

[Hook: Proof]
This my love letters, to all my people before cheddar, no vendettas right now lets settle
This my love letters
To Denaun Porter
This is my love letters, I love y'all
My love letters (haha)
This is my love letters, to all my people before cheddar, no vendettas lets settle
We out to get em
This my love letters
To D12 my nigga
This my love letters, I love y'all (come on)

[Outro]
Yea, just to let y'all know you know what I'm saying
Sometimes I don't stress it vocally, so y'all can see it and hopefully, we can get along socially you know what I'm saying
Locally to globally (ha) [?] overseas
Just want y'all to know, man to man, I love y'all and thanks for everything y'all done I'm proud of y'all you hear me

[Hook]
This my love letters, to all my people before cheddar, no vendettas right now lets settle

This my love letters, to all my people before cheddar, no vendettas lets settle
We out to get em
