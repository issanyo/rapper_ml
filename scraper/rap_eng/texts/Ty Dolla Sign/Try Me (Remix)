Got shooters on the west side and the south-west
Messing with the target and they say its your best

[Hook: DeJ Loaf]
Let a nigga try me, try me (yeah)
I'mma get his whole mothafuckin' family (whassup)
And I ain't playin' with nobody
Fuck around and I'mma catch a body
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'mma get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin' with nobody
Fuck around and I'mma catch a body](4226547)

[Verse 1: DeJ Loaf]
Tommys, macks and choppers bring that bitch up out him
Shoes cost a fortune, so watch where you walking
While she be gettin' fly, bitch I do this often
We be cuttin' up in traffic but we often dolphins
Leave a nigga swimmin', have yo' funeral in that ocean
They say "DeJ got the juice", yeah I got that potion, whoa
And I keep that nine on me so play crazy, it's fine with me
Choppers scream, you go down on me, oh
I'll get her on my song, I was just like "free Remy"
All these bitches throwin' shots, come get you some free Henny, eh
Whoa, where she find that? She ain't signed yet
She ain't competing with these hoes, it ain't no contest

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Let that nigga try me, try me
Homies on him like a paparazzi
Skirt off in that Maserati
Fuck yo' bitch and make her call me papi
Uh, she give me toppy, super sloppy
Fuck around and do the whole posse
I'm smoking OG and sippin' Rossi
Penthouse suite, somethin' real bossy
Lil Feezy got the fo' feezy
And we goin' hard cause it ain't easy
In the club yellin' "Fuck you!"
And hell nah, it ain't never bull
Twenty bottles, twenty bottles
We pour it up, aye, shout out Rihanna
Them niggas lookin', ain't know where to find us
At the top, bitch, like the topic

[Interlude: Remy Ma]
What? What happened? Oh, oh
That's what I thought, that's what I thought
*laughs*

[Hook 2: Remy Ma]

Let a nigga try me, try me

Fuck around and I'mma catch a homi

[Verse 3: Remy Ma]
Don't keep it in a stash, I keep it on me
Hit his wifey and hit his shorty
I ain't the one to war wit', who want it?
I'll leave ya fam in the wake, mournin'
I send you to the doctor with the reviver
Hit the passenger then hit the driver
I move like a mobster, you chicks is funny
I could make you do a summy, shit get ugly
I hate bum bitches window shoppin'
Make a lot of money, you should see my pockets
I wear heavy jewels, check, we all brocky
Come to ya piece, hit you in ya lobby
I lay a nigga down if he try to rob me
I put that on Pun, that's word to papi
I stay on go mode, they can't stop me
I'm the original, these broads copies
Flow used to be tight, now you all sloppy
That's why they all like "Remy Ma, when you droppin'?"
If one of these chicks ever try to try me
I'mma hit a ho mothafuckin' body

[Hook 2: Remy Ma]
