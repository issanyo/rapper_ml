[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Oh yeah
Dolla $ign
Oh no, no, no, yeah

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I just got back in town
She didn't want me then, she want me now
911 turbo, I'm stoned and
Everything fast, I'm for real

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm for real, I'm for real
I'm for real, I'm for real
For real!
I'm for real, I'm for real
I'm for real, I'm for real
Pull up on her real slow
Just so she can see me comin'
I just had to let her know
I'm for real, I'm for real
Pull up on her real slow
Just so she can see me comin'
I just had to let her know
I'm for real, I'm for real
For real!

[Break: Ty Dolla $ign & iLoveMakonnen]
Let's go
Ooh yeah-eah
For real!
For real!
Let's go
Ooh yeah-eah
Ooh yeah-eah

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I had to swerve on that bitch like my dawg Makonnen
Nah this is not a rental, lil' bitch I own it
Had to boss up on 'em cause I'm young and I'm rich
I got niggas still hatin' on me, ain't that a bitch?

[Verse 3: iLoveMakonnen]
Wonder how I got so many shows
And got so many hoes, but still got time for yours
Puttin' up all the time
Like why should I stop? I'm always on my grind

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm for real, I'm for real
I'm for real, I'm for real
For real!
I'm for real, I'm for real
I'm for real, I'm for real
Pull up on her real slow
Just so she can see me comin'
I just had to let her know
I'm for real, I'm for real
Pull up on her real slow
Just so she can see me comin'
I just had to let her know
I'm for real, I'm for real
For real!

[Break: Ty Dolla $ign & iLoveMakonnen]
Let's go
Ooh yeah-eah

[Verse 4: iLoveMakonnen]
On my grind
'Bout the dollar sign like my bro Ty
Always first class when I have to fly
In them new jets, you ain't seen it yet
Rookie year, ballin' like a fuckin' vet
Ballin' like a fuckin' vet
Rookie year, ballin' like a fuckin' vet
Ballin' like a fuckin' vet

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Everything fast, I'm for real
I'm for real, I'm for real
I'm for real, I'm for real
For real!
I'm for real, I'm for real
I'm for real, I'm for real
Pull up on her real slow
Just so she can see me comin'
I just had to let her know
I'm for real, I'm for real
Pull up on her real slow
Just so she can see me comin'
I just had to let her know
I'm for real, I'm for real
For real!
