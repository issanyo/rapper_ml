[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh]
I got somethin' to blow your back out (back out)
I got somethin' to blow your back out
I got somethin' to blow your back out (back out)
I got somethin' to blow your back out
I can tell by the look in your eyes, babe
You ain't had a real nigga in your life, ayy
I can tell by the look in your eyes, babe
You ain't had a real nigga in your life, ayy
I got somethin' to blow your back out (back out)
I got somethin' to blow your back out
I got somethin' to blow your back out (back out)
I got somethin' to blow your back out

[Verse 1: Nef The Pharaoh]
I hit it and pull her tracks out
The Chang, I make 'em tap out
Switchin' positions 'til she pass out
She fell asleep with her ass out
It all started at a party, she was dancin' seductive
Then Snoop came on, we got a Sexual Eruption
I don't really kiss and tell, you just gotta wish me well
Fine like wine, she cold enough to freeze over hell
Like a boat, you One in a Million
Wrote a Four Page Letter, what a wonderful feelin', my left eye
Go a little crazy when I think about baby
Give her TLC, she Waterfall on me
I know you been lookin' for the one
She don't wanna be a player, Big Pun
So I hit her with the john, wake her up
She got me goin' crazy for her coco puffs

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh]
I got somethin' to blow your back out (back out)
I got somethin' to blow your back out
I got somethin' to blow your back out (back out)
I got somethin' to blow your back out
I can tell by the look in your eyes, babe
You ain't had a real nigga in your life, ayy
I can tell by the look in your eyes, babe
You ain't had a real nigga in your life, ayy
I got somethin' to blow your back out (back out)
I got somethin' to blow your back out
I got somethin' to blow your back out (back out)
I got somethin' to blow your back out

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
'Tron got you all in your zone
You said, "Dolla, don't leave me here alone"
That booty got a mind of its own
Well, I bet you can't do it on the pole
She said, "Dolla, I can take the D (oh yeah)
Nigga, don't sleep on me (yeah)
Don't you ever count me out (me out)
I'm a certified freak, no doubt"
Smack you on the ass and you tell me go all the (go all the)
Like to get choked when I'm on top (on top)
Kissin' on your breasts when you ride it (she said)
"Boy, you know I never be a side bitch
Dolla, blow my back out, ooh yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I won't give it to nobody else", ooh yeah, aw, yeah

[Chorus: Nef The Pharaoh]
I got somethin' to blow your back out (back out)
I got somethin' to blow your back out
I got somethin' to blow your back out (back out)
I got somethin' to blow your back out
I can tell by the look in your eyes, babe
You ain't had a real nigga in your life, ayy
I can tell by the look in your eyes, babe
You ain't had a real nigga in your life, ayy
I got somethin' to blow your back out (back out)
I got somethin' to blow your back out
I got somethin' to blow your back out (back out)
I got somethin' to blow your back out
