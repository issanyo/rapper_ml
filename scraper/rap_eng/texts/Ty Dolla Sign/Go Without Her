[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Can't stand my bitch, but I can't go without her
She wake me up, give me head in the mornin'
She fuck me every time when I get horny
Ooh, yeah
Can't stand my bitch, but I can't go without her
We done already caught each other cheatin'
She say she hate me, but my bitch will never leave me

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Last night I never made it home
My bitch was blowin' up my phone
Say she got that female intuition
She already know's what was goin' on
Told her I was in the studio
Really, I was with a big booty hoe
It's my birthday, so it's her hurt day
And she can't even trip
Mama told me never trust that bitch
She did it once, she'll do it again
But when a women's fed up
She ain't tryna shoot a fair one

[Pre-Hook]
But this the only girl I ever go bareback
And I be damned if I ever share that
We don't love these hoes
I text my bitch like "where you at?"

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Can't stand my bitch, but I can't go without her
She wake me up, give me head in the mornin'
She fuck me every time when I get horny
Ooh, yeah
Can't stand my bitch, but I can't go without her
We done already caught each other cheatin'
She say she hate me, but my bitch will never leave me

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
My bitch act just like Keyshia Cole
But she look more like Aaliyah though
She know I'm solid, but I make mistakes
And she fuck with me the long way
I got her tatted cause I love her
She fucked up, I got it covered
She still got mine
She tryna prove that she mine

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Can't stand my bitch, but I can't go without her
She wake me up, give me head in the mornin'
She fuck me every time when I get horny
Ooh, yeah

[Pre-Hook]
But this the only girl I ever go bareback
And I be damned if I ever share that
We don't love these hoes
