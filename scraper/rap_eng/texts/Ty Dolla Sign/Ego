[Intro]
Ego, ego
Ego, ego
Ego, ego
Don't let it go blow up your ego

[Verse 1]
I see you looking in the mirror
I see you thinking that you're killer
But could you love someone else like you love yourself right now?
If I got under the surface
I wonder if you'd even notice, yeah
I wonder could a girl like me get your heart on your sleeve somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
Know it's something I should try to hide
But it's too late and I don't wanna lie

[Chorus]
I'm thinking about you, you
I'm drinking about you, you
I hate that I do, now you know
Don't let it go, blow up your ego
You, you
I'm talking about you, you
I hate that I do, now you know
Don't let it go, blow up your ego

[Verse 2]
I guess I thought that I'd knew better
I told myself that I would never
I'd never let a guy I met get inside of my head like this, oh
I see you acting like you're modest, modest
But you're too pretty, let's be honest, honest
Hoping you were a different type to the one track minded guy

[Pre-Chorus]
Know it's something I should try to hide
But it's too late and I don't wanna lie

[Chorus]
I'm thinking about you, you
I'm drinking about you, you
I hate that I do, now you know
Don't let it go, blow up your ego
You, you
I'm talking about you, you
I hate that I do, now you know
Don't let it go, blow up your ego
Blow up your ego, blow up your ego
Now, now you know
Don't let it go blow up your ego

[Bridge: TY Dolla $ign]
Oh, let go of my ego
My baby boujee and bad like the Migos
I never question a thing, she always right
She never get in my way, she always right
By my side, everyday and every night
By my bed, buzz down, damn brace is full of ice
Grind up the vitamins and the kenzo
Rockstar sex at back of the limo
Anything for lil' baby, you the best
I can't witchu', darlin' you a mess
VV'S and the matching Rolex
You ain't never seen an ego big like, this

[Chorus]
I'm thinking about you, you
I'm drinking about you, you
I hate that I do, now you know
Don't let it go, blow up your ego
You, you
I'm talking about you, you
I hate that I do, now you know
Don't let it go, blow up your ego
Ooh, blow up your ego
Ooh, blow up your ego
Ooh, now, now you know
Don't let it go, blow up your ego
Ooh, blow up your ego
Ooh, blow up your ego
Ooh, now, now you know
Don't let it go blow up your ego
