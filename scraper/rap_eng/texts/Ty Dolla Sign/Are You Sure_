[Verse 1: Conor Maynard]
Let's not play
You told me to go and then you put your hands on me
(Hands on me)
Let's not play
I can feel your body, baby it remembers me
(Remembers me)

[Pre-Chorus: Conor Maynard]
Is he all that you, all that you need?
Oh, come on won't you please tell me
Oh-oh

[Chorus: Conor Maynard]
Who do you love?
Are you sure?
Who do you love?
And are you sure?
Who do you love?
Are you sure?
Who do you love?
And are you sure?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Conor Maynard]
Turn off your phone
He don't need to find out what he doesn't need to know
(Need to know)
So tell me what you wanna do
'Cause you can't split your heart in two
Now tell me what you wanna do, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Conor Maynard]
Is he all that you, all that you need?
Oh, come on won't you please tell me
Oh-oh

[Chorus: Conor Maynard]
Who do you love?
Are you sure?
Who do you love?
And are you sure?
Who do you love?
Are you sure?
Who do you love?
And are you sure?

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl tell me who you lovin' on
You know who I spend this money on
You say "Dolla buy me Balmain
Dolla, baby, buy me Vetements
Dolla take me on a boat ride"
You gonna ride it like a yacht tonight
Had you screaming like an opera
Say you only want Dolla

[Chorus: Conor Maynard]
Who do you love?
(Who do you love?)
Are you sure?
(And are you sure?)
Who do you love?
(Who do you love?)
And are you sure?
(And are you sure?)
Who do you love?
(Who do you love?)
Are you sure?
(Who do you love?)
Who do you love?
(Who do you love?)
And are you sure?
(Are you sure?)

[Break]
(Who do you love?)
And are you sure?
Who do you love?
And are you sure?
