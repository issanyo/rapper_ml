[Intro]
Dolla $ign
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I see two of my bitches in the club
And I know they know about each other
I think these bitches tryna set me up
Maybe I’m just paranoid

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I got a bad light skin from the valley
She be in the club with no panties
Little bitch, she used to be my favorite
But now we don’t speak the same language
I love my bitch, I could bang it
But my dark skin bitch know how to take dick
I got em both the same damn red bottoms
And bought em both the same damn fragrance
Both of my bitches drive Range Rovers
None of my bitches can stay over
Both of my bitches look good as fuck
Your bitch look like a boogawolf

[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
I see two of my bitches in the club
And I know they know about each other
I think these bitches tryna set me up
Maybe I’m just paranoid

[Bridge: Ty Dolla Sign]
Yeah I’m paranoid, I’m trippin'
I’ve been smoking, I’ve been sippin'
I’m fuckin around with two bitches
But I never made them hoes my missus

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Women talk, women talk
She run her mouth so much she can’t hear her own thoughts
Tell my old ho, she my new bitch
Tell my new bitch, she my old ho
Well, she used to be yo' ho
Dead, hold up, flatline
I fuck a bitch to sleep, nap time
I put my name on it if that’s mine
Pussy so wet she thought it got baptized
Ask me where I’m at, that’s a set-up
You ain’t talkin' bout nothin', bitch shut up
If you got a side chick, nigga what up
Both my girls in the club 'bout to nut up
Stalking on my network
Got her looking so hard that her neck hurt
And I ain’t trippin', I got room for 'em both
This is HAM Squad, I just doubled up my net worth

[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
I see two of my bitches in the club
And I know they know about each other
I think these bitches tryna set me up
Maybe I’m just paranoid

[Bridge: Ty Dolla Sign]
Yeah I’m paranoid, I’m trippin'
I’ve been smoking, I’ve been sippin'
I’m fuckin around with two bitches
But I never made them hoes my missus
Yeah I’m paranoid, I’m trippin'
I’ve been smoking, I’ve been sippin'
I’m fuckin around with two bitches
But I never made them hoes my missus

[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
I see two of my bitches in the club
And I know they know about each other
I think these bitches tryna set me up
Maybe I’m just paranoid
