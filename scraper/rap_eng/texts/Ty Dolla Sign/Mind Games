[Verse 1: 24hrs]
Now, what would you do?
If these niggas played you?
I don't play mind games

She from the H-Town
Stay in Mo City
I brought my bro with me
Lil bro with me
They say all my shit hard
Twenty a rockstar
We the new wave now
You see that we surfin'
Her body perfect
This shit is curtains

[Bridge: 24hrs]
She say, "Twenty, don't play
You can fuck me everyday
You should hit it sideways"
She say, "Twenty, don't play
You can fuck me everyday
You should hit it sideways"
She say, "Twenty, don't play
You should beat it out the frame
I know you don't play no games, boy"
