Flew to South Beach just so she can feel the heat
Plus she got her best friend that fuck a nigga on the heat
Auto girl, Porsches is foreign

Baby, all I wanna do is tell you
All the things I wanna do - tell you

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla Sign]
Why ya gotta be so nasty?
I ain't complainin' girl, I'm just askin'
You drive a nice car, live in the Hamptons
Said I could come fuck you in the mansion
Freaky things that you do with your tongue, girl
Type of shit that get a young nigga sprung, girl
Left right, up and down like a locomotive
Hit it from the back, got you when I choke
Woooah!
Toot it up for a real nigga, girl
You don't belong round these lames
Lemme put the Dolla $ign in it
Hands on yo knees, side to side with it, Dolla

[Hook: Velous]
Proud to be the nigga on the side
Proud Side Nigga, I'm a proud side nigga
Proud to be the nigga on the side
Proud Side Nigga, I'm a proud side nigga
Proud to be the nigga on the side
