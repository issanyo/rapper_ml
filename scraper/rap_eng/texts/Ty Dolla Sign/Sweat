[Verse 1 : Pricetag]
I'm on the 10th floor, Room 36
It ain't no contemplation
My job occupation is to make your body drip
So if you feel like you didn't have a chance before
Its the perfect time for you to try your luck now
Imma leave your body sweatin like you ran a marathon
And you just scored a couple of touchdowns
Girl your not to speak rub on these boxer briefs
And prepare for me and you to have a stand off
I want you to sweat so baby turn the fan off
As you proceed to throw it back on me like a hand off
Girl we kissin and touchin again
Clock clock tick and we rushin again
Yeah Imma break it
You goin make faces
And we can trade places
Like usher and them


[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Baby I can make you sweat
All over your body
I can make you sweat
Work you like a 9 to 5
But I stay for over time
Girl I want your body
Your body
Your body baby
Your body
Your body
Your body baby



[Verse 2 : Oktane]
I say how I wanna do this baby
How I wanna do this
She said we go right now
Up in the shower
Boy lets do this
Soap Imma get this thing get water
She calls me daddy
But that ain't my daughter
It's bathroom steamin
I don't know whats sweat
And I don't know whats water
I'm just watchin mama drip
On my back she scratch and grip
All up in the shower almost slip
She starts yellin I don't quit
Becuz quittin is for quitters
Imma a DJ so I spin her
Shes my last meal of my day
Right after dinner


[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]


[Verse 3 : Pricetag]
And I say first thing first thing
Touch on you's the first thing
Your bodys calling me
And Imma answer on the first ring
And girl we don't need no more frontin
Just grab that camera right there
And hit that record button
And I say first thing first thing
Touch on yous the first thing
Your bodys calling me
And Imma answer on the first ring
And girl we don't need no more frontin
Just grab that camera right there
And hit that record button
