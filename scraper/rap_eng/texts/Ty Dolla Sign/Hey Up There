[Chorus: Buddy]
Hey up there I'm on my way up
Tell the radio to play us
Blame it on the place I grew up
Hit that land mine then I blew up
I've been on my job too long
Damn right I know what I do wrong
Ain't no way that I'm gon' change up
Now everybody better pay up

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Elevator on my way up (on my way up)
Penthouse, bad bitch with her feet up (with her feet up, yeah)
Dolla need that new Bentley truck (new Bentley truck)
They just mad they wanna be us, oh
Pull out the window, foot on the gas (gas)
Mixin' that Raf with the Kenzo sell 'em out fast
Slushy, my diamond they wet
Slushy, my diamond they wet
Always been one step ahead, I keep my foot on their neck, yeah
Aye, with the gang gang, bitch I'm with the gang gang (gang, gang)
And when I'm in my Rolls Royce I take up two lanes (two lanes)
They be like "Boy that's how you feel?"
I be like "Shit yeah"
Aye DJ turn this shit up yeah this that shit, yeah

[Chorus: Buddy]
Hey up there I'm on my way up
(Hey up there I'm on my way up)
Tell the radio to play us
(Tell the radio to play us)
Blame it on the place I grew up
(Shit, blame it on the place I grew)
Hit that land mine then I blew up
(Yeah, young nigga then blew up)
I've been on my job too long
(Shit, I been doin' too much)
Damn right I know what I do wrong
(Shit, sometimes I be fuckin' up)
Ain't no way that I'm gon' change up
(Shit, I'ma be like this for good)
Now everybody better pay up

[Verse 2: Buddy]
Pay up, pay up
Tryna get rich don't wanna be famous
With my day ones, 75 cents to catch that bus
Came up, came up got my check and then I finesse
Say I got next
Got right now so I guess I'll just, kick my feet up
Smokin' all this weed, I need a re-up
Give it all to me, more money, money
Can't tell me nothing
We out here struggling
This why we hustling

[Bridge: Buddy]
Never heard it like this don't lie
You ain't never heard it like this don't lie
Never heard it like this don't lie
We ain't have gifts at Christmas time
Now I'm gettin' mine
Niggas out here be switchin' sides
Stay down 'til I touch the sky, that's right

[Chorus: Buddy]
Hey up there I'm on my way up
(Hey up there I'm on my way up)
Tell the radio to play us
(Tell the radio to play us)
Blame it on the place I grew up
(Aye, blame it on the place I grew)
Hit that land mine then I blew up
(Yeah, young nigga then blew up)
I've been on my job too long
(Shit, I been doin' too much)
Damn right I know what I do wrong
(Shit, sometimes I be fuckin' up)
Ain't no way that I'm gon' change up
(Shit, I'ma be like this for good)
Now everybody better pay up

[Outro: Buddy]
Granny used to tell me "Boy don't look back"
That was '96, I was bumpin' Outkast
She was up in church like Hallelujah
Now it's getting scary Freddy Krueger
