[Intro]
Ayy! This shit
This shit, this shit
My life, my life
Nigga, this shit brazy
Uh, nigga, this shit brazy
This shit, this shit
This shit brazy
This shit, this shit
This shit brazy
Nigga, this shit brazy, oh Lord!
Oh, this shit brazy

[Verse 1]
Look at my life
Been through it all, got bullet wounds twice
Still don't know where it came from, yikes
Why everybody want a piece of my pie?
I, I, gotta keep guns with me
Shit real, I ain't tryna be pretty
Paranoia got this Henny in my kidney (Woo)
'Cause I don't know if they're with me or against me (Woo)
They always said this was how it's gon' be
But me... I ain't wanna believe
They don't wanna see a nigga with the green (With the green)
The reason for the 40 cal with the beam (With the beam)
The devil's on me, got me trippin'
I used to party out with Scotty like Pippen
Now I don't trust niggas, and I stopped invitin' bitches
Over to the crib, they can't know where I'm livin'

[Chorus]
Shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
This shit, nigga, this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
Oh, this shit, this shit
This shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy (Oh Lord)
Oh, Lord, nigga this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
Oh, shit, this shit, this shit
This shit brazy

[Verse 2]
Verse two (Verse two), verse two (Verse two)
I got too much to spit for verse two (Verse two)
Just be careful on how you approach dude
Cause he done already heard about what you wanna do
Paranoia, paranoia
Paranoia down in killer California
What's their motive? What's their motive?
Shit, I'm the closest with some money that they know of
Lady problems, family problems
Homies problems, all this drama
On my mama, this the type of shit you sweat out in the sauna
Grandma pray for me, devil keep away from me
Fell out with my day one, that was my ace to me
Mind blown, somethin' different what I'm on
All this shit got me in another rhyme zone
Lately, I've been at home
I grab the pistol when I answer the door

[Chorus]
'Cause shit brazy, shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
This shit, nigga, this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
Oh this shit, this shit
This shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy (Oh Lord)
Oh Lord, nigga this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
This shit, this shit
This shit brazy

[Verse 3]
I ain't F with this, but I F with this
Can't complain about it, gotta find out where he gonna master it
Gotta put cameras all around the crib
Gotta, gotta wear the vest like a bib
Got some, got some problems, why a whole lotta
So I stay dangerous, Osama
Nigga say they heard about a million dollars
So I gotta bulletproof the Impala
Man, I'm 'bout to lose it
Homies I'm confused with
Money get involved, it's all bad, they switch too quick
It's too sick, thought you was realer, my nigga
Got popped, you ain't do shit
Thought you was my killer, my nigga
Oh! Shit get realer, my nigga
When niggas know you gettin' skrilla, my nigga
I don't know what's gotten into my nigga
Close from day one, I was with him, my nigga

[Chorus]
This shit brazy
This shit, nigga, this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
Oh this shit, this shit
This shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy (Oh Lord)
Oh Lord, nigga this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
Oh shit, this shit, this shit
This shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
