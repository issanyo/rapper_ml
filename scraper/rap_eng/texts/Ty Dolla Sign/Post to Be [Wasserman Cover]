[Intro]
If your girl come close to me
She ain't going home when she post to be
I'm getting grown like I'm post to be
I'm getting grown like I'm post to be
Ooh, all my niggas close to me
And all them other niggas where they post to be
Ooh, the girls go for me
Have my phone blowing up, "Come home to me"
Ooh, that's how it post to be
Yeah, that's how it post to be
Ooh,  that's how it post to be
Everything good like it post to be

[Verse 1]
If your girl come close to me?
I might have her in the post with me
That's how its post to be
Posterize on your girl if I want the two
Well do I want the three?
Well we will have to see
I mean, I go hard in the pink
Panther coat when I hit the scene
So I know your girl gon' see me
Leave your ass on seen
Man this shit is getting interesting, god damn

[Break 1]
That's how its post to be—yeah, yeah
That's how its post to be—yeah, yeah
So if you wanna get it settled, run it right to me
Pay me on the side and I'll let her ass go free

[Hook]
Walking round the city in some new shoes
Walking round the city with a new chain
Old school nigga with some new moves
Old school nigga from the '18
Old school nigga since '02
Old school shit that's the go to
Old school nigga this is what I do
Old school nigga man I told you

[Verse 2]
Take a picture of my new girl, post it on the gram
Show her off—I ain't gotta be scared
You better check yourself before you wreck yourself
You better text your girl, she ain't gon' text herself
I got a question, if you was looking for your other half
And had to choose, would you next yourself?
Man, if I did, I'm sure it probably last—shit
I'm kinda lying, that be kinda drastic
Take the beat for cheap then drag it
Make the heat for seats, for asses
Cause the cakes the dream, the weed and acid
Rap is plastic, toxic as cash is
Cassius Clay, Ali, Bumblebee reach fast
To transform the game, easy peasy actions
Rancid meat, burned in hell but angelic
The bread's so magnetic, your fan's'll get jealous
The shit's classic man
You don't even get the reference do you?
Intern representing Clive D
So if you fucking with the board then you're fucking with me
While LaG still waiting on some change like Gadoe
Kid Aristotle, sure poet
Never needed fireball—all he needs is MoJo
Up in Lauren's class so stay rocking Polo
Oh no, if I'm tryna be like Stevie then gotta stay in key though
So she keep it like Segal and throw it back—akido
'Fore I hit with the fuck you—V of V like Cee Lo
Better pay me all my green, ho
Jeff told me hit 'em with the free throws
Stay away from kilos and keep on doing me
So I'm make the music so good that you gotta kinda hate me
With no reason not to date me on the daily—yeah

[Break 2]
That's how its post to be—yeah, yeah
That's how its post to be—yeah, yeah
That's how its post to be
Everything good like its post to be

[Hook]
Walking round the city in some new shoes

[Outro]
In some new shoes
That's how its post to be, in a new chain
With some new moves
That's how its post to be, from the '18
In some new shoes
That's how its post to be, in a new chain
This is what I do—that's how it's post to be
