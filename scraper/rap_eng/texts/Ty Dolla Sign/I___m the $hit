[Verse 1: JAG]
With the homies, and they all down
Ain't nno way that I could fall now
Nigga couldn't get a call from m, now I'm poppin, bet I get a call now
Got some haters, and they all clowns
Dog a nigga with the paws now
10 years since a shooter, made them bitches think that I'm ballen now
Dog a nigga till he can't ride
Kill the beat, I need a black tigh
Asian bitch is the side piece, she goin eat a nigga with the Pen ty
I don't ever let the track ride
That's why they lovin on the fat guy
Chain shinin like it's holy water, woke up feelin like I'm baptised
It's all about timing, nigga
Yeah, I ain't got time for niggas
Yeah, I could be grindin, nigga
Yeah, don't you try to hate, I got off the block, now I'm shining, nigga
Yeah, they finna find ya, nigga
Yeah, Imma keep climbin, nigga

[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
Brand new Jag, brand new Porsh
In LA, million stores
I put carrots in her braces
That's my x, she too basic
Issa bop, this a hit
Lookin in the mearor, like, nigga, I'm the shit
Should I bust a Rolli, should I bust a AP
You might get dapped, if you try to play me

[Verse 2: JAG]
Water whippin, put a tool in it
That's just how I gotta move, ain't it
You niggas, you is dead broke, so you bought a whip, and had to move in it
Bought a 5th, and went bool in it
Gucci shirt, got a fool in it
Me let a nigga brim, nigga got a pool with a pool in it
Gold cahinz like the 80s, nigga stuntin like Baby
Big talk like Gravy, got the hood going crazy
Nigga never had a new squad, same niggas with the juice, guy
Moves out on the ghost, nigga, cause the wraith had to get a boo job
Bitch, I ride for the jetlag
Snitchin up, get your head tagged
Came in here with the blood homies, get a red flag for the red flag
Put in the work, and I got a Jag
I went berzerk, and I got a bag

[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
Brand new Jag, brand new Porsh
In LA, million stores
I put carrots in her braces
That's my x, she too basic
Issa bop, this a hit
Lookin in the mearor, like, nigga, I'm the shit
Should I bust a Rolli, should I bust a AP
You might get dapped, if you try to play me
