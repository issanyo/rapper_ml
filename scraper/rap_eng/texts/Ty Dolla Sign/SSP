[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Wrist turnt, sip syrup, smoke and purp'
Pop a perc', left her, savage gone, now we on
Shit was different back when we was home
Keep it goin', feds tappin' on my mobile phone

[Verse 1: Dice SoHo]
Ayy, walk in the court smellin' like gelato
Bust down Rollie and a Mavado
Ice in my face 'cause I know it's my time
Cut the bitch off, she got outta line
New bitch ass soft as a cushion
Hoochies call me like, "We gotta keep pushin'"
They tryna get time in the feds
Shit fucked up, will chop off my head (hey)
Remember school days with Brody and Lex
I done had a couple homies that switched, I done see my pop break down a brick
I just sent the hoe to break down a trick, ayy
No hand outs, had to put in the grind
Mama trippin', thought it wasn't gon' work
My dog turn his back on me, that shit hurt
Fuck it, I ain't trippin', shit could be worse
Hop in the drop top, while I skrrt
I been a real nigga since birth (hell yeah)
Ayy, Travis stopped fuckin' with me 'cause of hoes
Fuck it, it's a lifestyle that I chose, that's how it goes

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Wrist turnt, sip syrup, smoke and purp'
Pop a perc', left her, savage gone, now we on
Shit was different back when we was home
Keep it goin', feds tappin' on my mobile phone
Wrist turnt, sip syrup, smoke and purp'
Pop a perc', left her, savage gone, now we on
Shit was different back when we was home
Keep it goin', feds tappin' on my mobile phone

[Verse 2: Desiigner]
Feds tap the mobile phone, I like to hold the chrome, yeah
I feel like Macaulay Culkin, uh, I like it home alone, uh
I'm from the hood where them niggas be trappin' on the block
And they trappin' at home, uh
First we had sex, now break up, yeah, face down, ass up, legs up, yeah
Face look pure, no make up, yeah, I look good, I stay up, yeah
I count cash, no pay cut, yeah, I cook crack, I bake up, yeah
I took my service gone, uh, I got a mobile phone, uh
I'm trap at home, alone, uh, nigga, I got a chrome

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Wrist turnt, sip syrup, smoke and purp'
Pop a perc', left her, savage gone, now we on
Shit was different back when we was home
Keep it goin', feds tappin' on my mobile phone

[Bridge: Dice SoHo]
Woah, get the dough is all I know
So, yeah, 'cause they gon' hate regardless
No love for these bitches, I'm heartless
Secure the bag, that's a goal, goal

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Wrist turnt, sip syrup, smoke and purp'
Pop a perc', left her, savage gone, now we on
Shit was different back when we was home
Keep it goin', feds tappin' on my mobile phone
Wrist turnt, sip syrup, smoke and purp'
Pop a perc', left her, savage gone, now we on
Shit was different back when we was home
Keep it goin', feds tappin' on my mobile phone
