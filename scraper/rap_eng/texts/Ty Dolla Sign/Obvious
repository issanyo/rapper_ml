[Intro: TeeCee4800]
It's obvious
Good job, 1st

[Verse 1: TeeCee4800]
Don't fuck with us, that's obvious, money over here, that's obvious
Blue rag on my lap, you know who I'm ridin' with
TeeCee48 always on some fly shit
Where the flathead? It's a safe in the closet
That's how I got rich, that's how I got bricks
That's why all these niggas and these bitches on my dick
Fuck a nigga mean? I was emptyin' the clip
I done gave everything, I don't owe a nigga shit, uh
Flockin' in my cargos, prayin' to the Lord, don't
Let me get detoured before I get the hardcore
They don't fuck with us, it's obvious
They like, "TeeCee, why you body this?"

[Chorus: 24hrs]
They don't fuck with us, it's obvious
We ain't trippin', that's on moms
See the movement, finna run it up
You know we gettin' to them commas
They don't fuck with us, it's obvious
They don't fuck with us, it's obvious
They don't fuck with us, it's obvious
You know we gettin' to them commas

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
They don't fuck with us, it's obvious
First, they hate unless they copy us
Your bitch give me head, the sloppiest
Ass clappin' like the audience
They don't fuck with us, clearly
First, these niggas switch teams, then they cheerlead
They don't fuck with us, but nah they ain't in them bands, though
They don't like me, but now they cut their pants though
They don't fuck with TeeCee but now it's regular
"Lecrae can't make a song with Dolla, he too secular"
"Girl, don't take him serious, he a misogynist"
They don't fuck with us, it's obvious
"Why the fuck he on his phone so much?
He be leavin' you alone too much
He don't fuck with you, it's obvious
That's how my best friend got at my ex, I swear to God"

[Chorus: 24hrs]
They don't fuck with us, it's obvious
We ain't trippin', that's on moms
See the movement, finna run it up
You know we gettin' to them commas
They don't fuck with us, it's obvious
They don't fuck with us, it's obvious
They don't fuck with us, it's obvious
You know we gettin' to them commas
