[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Thinking to myself man, I'm too sexy for my girl man
I'm too sexy for myself, man I'm too balling
Can't just bear this by myself
I ain't ashamed that I got help
I ain't afraid to share the world
Late nights, thought we never went to sleep
And I still got Old Skools on my feet
OG only, we don't do no purple
Paid that Porsche all with that Dodge commercial
And when I land in the city she gon' drive that two hours
Just to come and see me
And if she want that dick and gas money
I put it girl, she told me, I don't want your money

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I put it down so deep she feel it in her stomach
She say she love me and it ain't about the money
What are we doing? What are we doing?
What are we doing? What are we doing, doing, doing?
I let her push the foreign, ran 'em out of town
She let me hit it when her boyfriend not around
What are we doing? What are we doing?
What are we doing, doing, doing?
What are we doing, doing ,doing?

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
I don't wanna hurt nobody
I don't wanna hurt nobody
That's why I can't trust nobody
I don't wanna hurt nobody

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign] (x2)
Thinking to myself man, I'm too sexy for my girl man
I'm too sexy for myself, man I'm too balling
Can't just bear this by myself
I ain't ashamed that I got help
I ain't afraid to share the world

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I put it down so deep she feel it in her stomach
She say she love me and it ain't about the money
What are we doing? What are we doing?
What are we doing? What are we doing, doing, doing?
I let her push the foreign, ran 'em out of town
She let me hit it when her boyfriend not around
What are we doing? What are we doing?
What are we doing, doing, doing?
What are we doing, doing ,doing?

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
I don't wanna hurt nobody
I don't wanna hurt nobody
That's why I can't trust nobody
I don't wanna hurt nobody
