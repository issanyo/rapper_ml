[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Got your legs on my shoulders
I rev it like the motor
Back and forth
Looking in your eyes
Then you tell me that you love it
But you know we ain't making love, we just fucking
Still tell me that you love me
But you know we ain't making love, we just fucking...

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Missionary (x4)

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Got a bad bitch I met in my hood
And damn, she ride this dick so good
I'm competitive, so I had to get on top
Show her that I really know how to fuck
I slam on it like Blake
Kill the pussy yellow tape
She said, "Damn, daddy, I can't take it"
I said, "Ooh, girl, stop complaining"
I go deeper than your ex
Never had sex like this
And usually I don't kiss
But you're so damn bad, I had to hit it (missionary)

[Hook]

[Interlude: Mila J]
You on top of me
So I know it's real (x2)
You get on top so I know it's real
