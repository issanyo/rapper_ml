[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Cook out in the middle of May with miles down
Bad bitch in Santa Ana she love the Fanta
Her favorite team is the Panthers
Her favorite snack is a Jolly Rancher
Her sign is a Cancer
I love talking to her 'cause she got all the answers
My niggas love when I bring her around 'cause her friends are dancers, woah
And she's so perfect
She belongs on the surface
She belongs with me
She deserve everything she wants and needs
She wants Lil Boat to get down on one knee
But I'm too young, most hated they should call Lil Boat Nick Young
Take down, you stayed down and rolled up my gum
Nut on your lips, it's the gums
Just for fun, I'm on

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I'm movin' up, I'm movin', I'm movin' up
I'm movin' up, I'm movin', movin' up
I'm movin' up, I'm movin' up, I'm movin'
I'm movin' up, I'm movin', movin' up
I'm movin'

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Little boo in the month of June
In the bathing suit, she chillin' right by the pool
Met in Vegas, favorite team is the Raiders
She wished they never moved from the Bay though
Her sign is a Virgo
Say that she smoke but she don't know how to roll though
The homies love it when I bring her 'round 'cause she know all the hoes
And she so worth it
She belongs on the surface
She belongs with me
She just want someone to keep it one hun'
She want a rerun, want one ofter one
She said Dolla boy I'll tattoo your name
Promise I won't give this pussy away
I tell her baby that I'm not afraid
Tell by the look on my face that I'm

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I'm movin' up, I'm movin', I'm movin' up
I'm movin' up, I'm movin', movin' up
I'm movin' up, I'm movin' up, I'm movin'
I'm movin' up, I'm movin', movin' up
I'm movin'
