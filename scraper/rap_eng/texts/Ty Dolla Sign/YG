[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Got a little bad Spanish bitch named Claudia
Her dad from the Mexican mafia
Took me to her turf, the varrio
I was in and out like "adios"

Slide to the set like "what's happening though"
29th street to the avenues
Shout to Big B, that's my big homie
Little [?] rocked in my OG's

Pushaz Ink the label and it's tatted
My pistol is a semi-automatic
I only fuck with gangsters and strippers
I fuck with the Lakers not the Clippers

[Hook]
Like that, nah like this
Give it up, give it up, slide like this
Two step, slide like this
Do your stuff, I do mine like this (like this)

I do mine like this (like this)
I do mine like this (like this)
I do mine like, like this (like this)
Like this (like this)

Like that, bitch I'm gone like this
Give it up, give it up, slide like this
Like that, bitch I'm gone like this
Give it up, give it up, slide like this

[Verse 2: YG]
Y'all niggas know my name, woo woo
Bang on everything
[?], four or five chains
Let out shots and don't hit shit, work on your aim

Since I been getting rap money, niggas act funny
Five dollar dice game, y'all a pack of bummies
Your bitch gets scummy, your kids ugly
She three months pregnant and she still fuck me

Lil Reese, he busting out the wheel
We shoot movies, four or five clips
I got my collar up, my squabbles up, I set a train, y'all follow up
My dollars up, my choppers up, y'all bitches like the Powerpuffs

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Moses]
Chucks with the fat ones
Hollywood bitches is weak, I want a rat one
Yellow bitch killer fasho, I want a black one
Top five dead or alive, it's no acting

Regals on [?], young niggas going nuts
Throw up the set to Obama, I give a fuck
If the pussy ain't fire I'm going straight in her butt
And yell out "woo", the bitch gon' poo

Black and red Levi's
YG general since I was a knee high
Busting out the black Pontiac or the neon
We got the white girl in the set, Celine Dion

[Hook]
