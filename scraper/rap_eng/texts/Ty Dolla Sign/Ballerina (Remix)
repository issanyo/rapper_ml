[Hook: Belly]
She mix the red and white wine like the Catalina (She do it)
You call her a stripper, that's my ballerina (Oh God)
See that's your stage but it's my arena (She mine)
That's not a stripper, that's my ballerina (Hold up)

[Post-Hook: Belly]
Let me see you dance for me, dance, dance, dance
Do a handstand for me, dance, dance, dance (She do it)
Baby can you pop it for me? Dance, dance, dance
Let me see you drop it for me, dance, dance, dance

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
She gon' dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
She my ballerina, when she move I throw the band
She got too much ass, she drop it down and throw it back
Told her, "Bet you can't, do it with a stick in there"
Dolla got a brand new Porsche, Dolla in Lamborghini
Dolla at the sold out arena, Dolla got a ballerina
Dolla in a brand new Porsche, Dolla bitch better than yours
Dolla, man fuck the strippers, Dolla got ballerinas
Yeah, she gon' do her dance, she gon' fuck it up
I'ma blow that bag, I'm gon' run it up
Go on do your dance, go on fuck it up
I'm blow a bag, I'm gon' run it up

[Post-Hook: Belly]
Let me see you dance for me, dance, dance, dance
Do a handstand for me, dance, dance, dance (She do it)
Baby can you pop it for me? Dance, dance, dance
Let me see you drop it for me, dance, dance, dance

[Verse 2: Belly]
Oh you playing but I got the cheat code (Yeah)
Shallow bitches always got the deep quotes (Do it!)
The block is hot but the streets cold (Yeah)
Shoes designer but she got a cheap soul, oh
I drop the top on that Maranello  (Sauce)
Big suitcases like we play the cello
Sleeping on me, get a bigger pillow
Live fast, die young just like Barrichello

[Hook: Belly]
She mix the red and white wine like the Catalina (She do it)
You call her a stripper, that's my ballerina (Oh God)
See that's your stage but it's my arena (She mine)
That's not a stripper, that's my ballerina (Hold up)

[Post-Hook: Belly]
Let me see you dance for me, dance, dance, dance
Do a handstand for me, dance, dance, dance (She do it)
Baby can you pop it for me? Dance, dance, dance
Let me see you drop it for me, dance, dance, dance
(Drop it, drop it, drop it)

[Bridge: Belly]
Dance, dance, dance (Do it)
Dance, dance, dance (Yeah)
She just want the Ros√© , she don't want your roses
Watch the pole split the water like it's Moses
She just wanna pull up in the Benzes and them Rollses'
She don't never pay attention to the vultures

[Hook: Belly]
She mix the red and white wine like the Catalina (She do it)
You call her a stripper, that's my ballerina (Oh God)
See that's your stage but it's my arena (She mine)
That's not a stripper, that's my ballerina (Hold up)

[Post-Hook: Belly]
Let me see you dance for me, dance, dance, dance
Do a handstand for me, dance, dance, dance (She do it)
Baby can you pop it for me? Dance, dance, dance
Let me see you drop it for me, dance, dance, dance
(Drop it, drop it, drop it)
