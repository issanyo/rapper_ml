[Intro]
Everybody wants to be famous, yeah, yeah
Everybody wants to be famous

[Verse 1]
Everybody wanna make it
Everybody tryna get somewhere
Everybody wants attention
Want you to know that they're standing right there
So many stars, they just wanna be up there with them
So they can shine bright and show the world how they fit in
Yeah, yeah
They want their name in the lights
Wanna be on your flatscreen
They wanna sign autographs, all the important things

[Chorus]
Everybody wants to be famous, yeah, yeah
Everybody wants to be famous
Anyway, anyhow
They ain't worried 'bout who they steppin' on, no
Just as long as they reach the top
They don't wanna die nameless, no
They just wanna be famous
Yeah, they wanna be famous
Ooh, they just wanna be famous

[Verse 2]
Everybody wants to be accepted
Accepted by all of your love
Just a couple likes from you (you)
Will be more than enough
They don't wanna work all day, they wanna make it overnight
Just to look good in public until they spend their last dimes

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody wants to be famous, yeah
Everybody wants to be famous
Anyway, anyhow
They ain't worried 'bout who they steppin' on, no
Just as long as they reach the top
They don't wanna die nameless, no
They just wanna be famous
Yeah, they wanna be famous (wanna be famous)
Ooh, they just wanna be famous (anyway, anyhow)

[Outro]
They just wanna be around
Everything that goes up, comes down (down, down)
Everything that goes up, comes down (down, down)
Still wanna be famous
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
