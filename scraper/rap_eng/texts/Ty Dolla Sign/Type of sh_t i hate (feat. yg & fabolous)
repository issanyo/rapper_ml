[Verse 1: Ty$ ]
She got some ice on her
Nice bag on her
Red bottoms on her heels
She smoke weed, drop pills
That's my little bitch, I got her nails done
24 inch weave hair long
She only fucking me 'cause I'm nigga rich
Plus I back call him a bitch
But I really like it, how she ride it
I told her put that thing on vibrate
She go irate, make it gyrate
She'll suck dick, type of bitch I hate
Oh, shit that I hate
That's the type of shit that I hate
Type of bitch make you take her on ten dates
Then she give you the pussy in a shit whip (damn)

[Hook 1: Ty$]
Type of shit that I hate
Yeah, type of shit that I hate
Woah, that's the type of shit that I hate
(Now I ain't gon' hate her but)
Woah, type of shit that I hate
(Yeah, I hate when people say I ain't hate 'em)
(I feel you though Dollar Sign)

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
I hate a groupie ho with a passion
Saying "that's the homie" but he smashin'
I hate to see a broke bitch flashin'
Chanel bag that she never keep cash in
Hate when bitches try to put you in the friend zone
Bitch I'm tryna score put me in the end zone
Hate to see a thick bitch on Instagram
And the bitch show up looking like a Teddy graham (I don't follow)
Flat butt, fat gut, thirst bucket, that's what
Type of shit that I hate, I let a thirsty ho dehydrate
Backward ass bitch, do a good nigga bad
'Sposed to keep you happy, they just make a nigga mad
Nosy ass hoes, I hate 'em
Always finding shit but can't find a man to date them, huh

[Hook 2: Ty$]
Type of shit that I hate
Yeah, type of shit that I hate
Woah, that's the type of shit that I hate
Woah, that's the type of bitch that I hate
Yeah, yeah

[Outro: Ty$]
I don't save hoes, 'cause niggas put the pussy on a pedestal
He ain't a player he a fuckboy
I'll never save her, she don't wanna be saved, no
No love for 'em if it wasn't for the money she don't fuck with 'em

[Hook 2: Ty$]
