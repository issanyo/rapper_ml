[Hook: Big TC]
Seem like shit is getting worse before it's getting better
It's like the people got a curse, can't nobody stay together
I watch you gun my people down, plus we're killing off each other, no, ooh, no
Ain't no justice for the brothers, no, no

[Verse 1: Big TC]
See the red lights behind his car
Only thing he thinking is this could be the end of me
Say officer, what's the problem?
It's like every time I turn around you people always messing with me
He say you look suspicious
And you fit the description of a call about a robbery
Then some more cops came
I keep my hands where they can see 'em, I know this could be the end of me
They say that
We all created equal but ain't nothing about us equal
You know that (You know that)
There can never be no justice when killing us is legal
Somebody's gotta take a stand
Sacrifice and be a man
Somebody's gotta take a stand, no, no

[Hook: Big TC & (Ty Dolla $ign)]
Seem like shit is getting worse before it's getting better
It's like the people got a curse, can't nobody stay together
I watch you gun my people down, plus we're killing off each other, no, ooh oh
Ain't no justice for the brothers
Seem like shit is getting worse (no, no) before it's getting better (no, no)
It's like the people got a curse (no, no), can't nobody stay together (no, no)
I watch you gun my people down (no, no), plus we're killing off each other (no, no), no, ooh oh (no, no)
Ain't no justice for the brothers (no, no), no, no

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
4AM in the morning, police banging real hard on my mama front door
Screaming open this shit right now
You got twenty more seconds before we tear this door down
They done handcuffed my mama
They done handcuffed my granny
Handcuffed my sister
Then some more cops came
Them crackers tore the whole house up, never even showed a warrant
They say that, we all created equal but ain't nothing about us equal
You know that (you know that)
There can never be no justice when killing us is legal
Somebody's gotta take a stand
Sacrifice and be a man
Somebody's gotta take a stand
