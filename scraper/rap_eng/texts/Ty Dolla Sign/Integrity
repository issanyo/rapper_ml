[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Integrity, integrity
Honesty, that's all you ever want from me
Talk down on the team, oh, that’s blasphemy
Loyalty, that's all you ever asked of me
Integrity, integrity
Honesty, that's all you ever want from me
Talk down on the team, oh, that’s blasphemy
Loyalty, that's all you ever asked of me

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
Y'all be talkin' too much, y'all be bitchin' up
Lames watchin', now we gotta switch it up (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Raspberry, Benzo drop
Damn, Acne denim with the Kenzo top
I will not tell what we've been talkin’ about
If you my nigga, you my nigga, there ain’t nothin' to talk about
You was down and now we up, the whole team ball out
I’ma ice it all out, yeah
You ain't doin' numbers, broke boy, you a small fry
My 38 Ksubis, yeah, they full with dead guys
If you did me wrong before, you gotta beg me for forgiveness
Dolla $ign a boss so I put him with my business

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Integrity, integrity
Honesty, that's all you ever want from me
Talk down on the team, oh, that’s blasphemy
Loyalty, that's all you ever asked of me
Integrity, integrity
Honesty, that's all you ever want from me
Talk down on the team, oh, that's blasphemy
Loyalty, that's all you ever asked of me

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Ayy, loyal to my brothers, bitch, I'm married to the game
Never ran from no nigga, bitch, I put that on the gang
I got niggas doin' bids when they really innocent
It ain't easy in the city for these young Black kids
I stay ten toes down, ups and downs, I never bend
I've been through all type of twists, they tried to infiltrate my crib
OG rules, how I was taught, I could never be bought
Seen my nigga get shot in front of me, I lost my dawg
Big B told me, "Young homie, you gon' make it if you stay consistent"
Never listen to a broke nigga who ain't ever been in your position
Niggas gon' have their opinion, but end of the day you gon' make the decision
Stick to your shit, don't you let negativity get in the way of your vision

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Integrity, integrity
Honesty, that's all you ever want from me
Talk down on the team, oh, that's blasphemy
Loyalty, that's all you ever asked of me

[Outro]
Integrity
That's all you ever want from me
That's blasphemy
Loyalty, that's all you ever asked of me
