[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Every time she call ya, she always got a problem
And end up wanting money, she only want your money
She only want your money, she only want your money
She only want some money, want your money
Ooh yeah

[Verse 1: RJ]
How come whenever she call ya she got her some issues?
Her problems always be involving some cheese
Ay, she keep her hands up in yo' pocket like a jack, boy
She don't think nothing is too much to ever ask for
She ain't a gold digger, call herself a trap star
Ain't got some propositions you can get some cash for
Cause you can't slide up in it 'less you got a black card
She text me I'm that nigga, I never hit back
She showed me all your messages, I know the fact
She said you is too soft for her, usually I'm off of her
You fix her wardrobe, pay notes on her car for her
Lord knows, it's OMMIO
She ain't gon' let you off the phone till you send her dough
And she don't think that she wrong, she like "We all grown"
Might be leading you on for a loan, nigga really, every time she

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Joe Moses]
She be in love with the money and fame, no fortune and thangs
No love for the game but she love me, swear to God she love me
I take her down and don't call her again, I be fucking her friend
Once again, baby, I am not your hubby, I am not your hubby
I'm just a nigga out the ghetto, ballin' like Harden
And, when I hit the pussy, I make her bounce like Spalding
No love for a thot, your problems is not
I'm just a nigga off the block, is you in or you not?
Are you down like four flats?
She tryna make it out the hood, nigga, that's facts

[Hook]
