[Hook: TY$ and YG]

She don't love me she just love my money
She see me on the block gettin' it
She just wanna spend my chips
Love my money
You say you love me but I don't believe that shit
Girl tell me what you want from me
I guess you a gold digger gold digger for sure
You ain't special you like every other girl I know

[Verse 1: YG]

Girl tell me what you want from me
I thought you was the one for me
Well I come to find out you was in it for the dough
I ain't got no love for no gold digger hoe
Yup, I tell it like it is not like it was
She was probably fucking with me just because
You saw me on the block gettin' it, money start to kick in
And that's when your trifling-ass started acting different
Excuse my mouth, I ain't tryna sound rude
But that's what a girl like you, make a nigga do
You call a nigga in the deep end
And I told you all of my secrets
The homies told me don't be mad
But that was my money spent on that Louis bag
Girl, and that's a cold way of living
But now you know why niggas put money over bitches

[Hook]

[Verse 2: YG]

I don't love that ho, I don't trust that bitch
Nigga fuck that ho, she can suck my dick
With no makeup that bitch is ugly
Found out she was using me for my money
Ohh, she know I got ( ) dough
And loving her fakeass got hella old
That's fucked up, no that ain't right
But it's a cold-ass world, girl this is life
I tried to give you a chance
But she told me she wanted rubber bands
Go fuck your other man
Cause I ain't with that bullshit
I need a bad bitch to look good with
Me and my old girl didn't get it on
Plus, her and my momma didn't get along
She truder than shit, she a gold digger
I asked her who she love, she said no nigga no nigga
