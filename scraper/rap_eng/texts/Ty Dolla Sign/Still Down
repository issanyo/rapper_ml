[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I ain't mean to make you mad
I ain't mean to make you mad at me
I ain't really mean that
I ain't mean to make you mad
I just wanna make it up
Let's smoke and let's fuck and get over it
I'm done with the talking I'm over it
We go through the motions we up and down
We made it this far
Let me know if you still down
All the shit we've been through
Let me know if you still down
We ain't got nothing to lose

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
You talking like twenty not good enough
We fight and we fuck and that's good enough
You sold from Atlanta don't wanna move
I'm sold by the cheque I don't wanna lose
I put you on Kenzo and Gucci
Hey twenty I heard you with Gucci
I'm known I'm knowing you loving me
Stay real stay down it's my loyalty

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I ain't mean to make you mad
I ain't mean to make you mad at me
I ain't really mean that
I ain't mean to make you mad
I just wanna make it up
Let's smoke and let's fuck and get over it
I'm done with the talking I'm over it
We go through the motions we up and down
We made it this far
Let me know if you still down
All the shit we've been through
Let me know if you still down
We ain't got nothing to lose

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla please don't make me look stupid
I know that you got all the groupies
You come back around and you hit me raw
I swear I don't give it to no one else
Trust,trust me baby
Ten toes down you got a real one yeah
Someone's in their feelings
Slow down girl, I'm just human
We ain't gotta kill the vibe
Smoke a j and keep it live
Maybe we should go inside and make love

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I ain't mean to make you mad
I ain't mean to make you mad at me
I ain't really mean that
I ain't mean to make you mad
I just wanna make it up
Let's smoke and let's fuck and get over it
I'm done with the talking I'm over it
We go through the motions we up and down
We made it this far
Let me know if you still down
All the shit we've been through
Let me know if you still down
We ain't got nothing to lose
