[Intro]
It's the same speech every time
No new niggas, loyalty
Yeah we might be famous but we still violent motherfucka

[Verse 1]
I just took a BR and now I'm floating
If it ain't that OG then I ain't smoking'
I woke up, I put a couple plays in motion
First I roll me up and joint and count my money man
Momma keep telling me that I smoke too much
My girl tell me, "Nigga blow that shit out the window"
I was rolling down the street smoking endo
Sipping on that Gin and juice like it's '92
Go against my crew, I don't recommend
Bitch, who the fuck are you? We don't let you in
Girls pause when the Taylor's in the function
Everybody from the game got jumped in
Yeah, niggas meet me at the park
Niggas gone run their flags
If a nigga get dropped, then you better get up
Niggas gone hit the joint, niggas gone sip the drank
Catch a enemy slipping, nigga gone pop the dime

[Hook]
Violent, all my niggas violent
Pop a nigga broad daylight with the silence
Smoking weed on a PJ with the pilot
I just got some bomb ass head from my side bitch, whoa
Violent, all my niggas violent
Pop a nigga broad daylight with the silence
Smoking weed on a PJ with the pilot
I just got some bomb ass head from my side bitch, whoa

[Verse 2]
Pop outs on me, hop outs on me
Nigga we don't do no drive-bys
If he owe me money, he ain't got my money
Tell his momma kiss him bye-bye
All my fans call me Dolla $ign
But my momma still call me Ty-Ty
First class on the flight to Hawaii
They got us all sipping the Mai Tai's
20's and 50's we roll together
I don't be kissing my bitches in public
At my level, bitch, we don't go together
I just fucked a bitch at one of the W suites
And she said I'm the coldest ever
I just popped a couple Mollys, Xans
Now they copy my swag, it's dope forever
I might be single forever
I'ma be me forever
I'ma be rich forever
M-O-B forever
Fucked her the first time I met her
Sucked on this dick cause I let her
I got a brand new Glock
And a Baretta

[Hook]
Violent, all my niggas violent
Pop a nigga broad daylight with the silence
Smoking weed on a PJ with the pilot
I just got some bomb ass head from my side bitch, whoa
Violent, all my niggas violent
Pop a nigga broad daylight with the silence
Smoking weed on a PJ with the pilot
I just got some bomb ass head from my side bitch

[Bridge]
The purp is for extra nigga
The purp is for extra nigga
That purp is for me and my nigga
I broke bread with me and my nigga
I told my young nigga YG 400 get rid of them extra niggas
Aye, you ain't getting money, lil' nigga, youse an extra nigga
$ign

[Outro]
Ty you better let these niggas know fool
It's an unstoppable force right here
The movement, 4800
Ayaaaaa
