[Malik Yusef Speaks]
At midnight the genius stroke the fuck outta you
Baby girl you hit this the wrong way it choke the fuck outta you
I rap you in these sheets and smoke the fuck outta you
Hit you with this D properly and turn a cluck outta you
Maybe in the morning I can get a buck outta you
If your credit is on point get a truck outta you
Do the fuck I gotta do, you a fan
