[Hook]
Girl I lay you down, holding on your shoulders
Beat that pussy up 'till four in the morning
Sex on drugs, sex on drugs, sex on drugs
Sex on drugs, sex on drugs, sex on drugs

[Verse]
Beat it with your feet pointed up to the ceiling
Bust inside, have me all in my feelings, god damn
God damn that pussy fire, god damn
I'ma stretch that pussy wider, god damn
Damn that pussy mine, huh
She said damn that pussy tight, huh
I said damn this dick good, huh
Damn you came up on a jugg, huh
See you bro don't like my hood, huh
Said I wish that nigga would, huh
Got you faded off the kush, huh
Tell me let's go round two, huh
Oh yeah

[Hook]
Girl I lay you down, holding on your shoulders
Beat that pussy up 'till four in the morning
Sex on drugs, sex on drugs, sex on drugs
Sex on drugs, sex on drugs, sex on drugs
