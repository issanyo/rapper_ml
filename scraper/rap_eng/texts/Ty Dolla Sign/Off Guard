[Chorus: Elvana + Ty Dolla $ign,   Ty Dolla $ign ]
Yeah you know you got me off guard, off guard, off guard
Why you gotta make it so hard, so hard, so hard
How you wake up in my heart?
I wasn't trying to meet nobody
Sucker Punch me  with love
Yeah you know you got me off guard, off guard, off guard
How you wake up in my heart?

[Verse 1: Elvana]
Caught me slipping with my guard down
Swear I had been in it all
Thought you would've gave up by now
But I see you ain't clean baby
I ain't never seen it coming, you was a nigga but ya gone off the Rose
You're a kangaray zipper ???
Took advantage of the moment, we was faded
Might've made it

[Chorus: Elvana + Ty Dolla $ign,   Ty Dolla $ign ]
Yeah you know you got me off guard, off guard, off guard
Why you gotta make it so hard, so hard, so hard
How you wake up in my heart?
I wasn't trying to meet nobody
Sucker Punch me  with love
Yeah you know you got me off guard, off guard, off guard
How you wake up in my heart?

[Elvana]
Oooh, caught me off guard
Oooh, caught me off guard

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'd never seen it coming we were just drinking liquor
Going out that Tanqueray, you a Rose sipper
Ask you for a lighter, you make sure we were lit
I ripped a bump, you hit your cigarette
Out the door then you ask me where I'm going
Like you was tryna take advantage of the moment
Next, we was dippin through my hood bending corners
Moving hella fast

[Chorus: Elvana + Ty Dolla $ign, (Elvana)]
Yeah you know you got me off guard (yeah), off guard (yeah babe), off guard (off)
Why you gotta make it so hard (make it so hard), so hard (yeah baby), so hard
How you wake up in my heart?
I wasn't trying to meet nobody
Sucker Punch me with love
Yeah you know you got me off guard, off guard, off guard
How you wake up in my heart?

[Elvana]
Oooh, can't believe you, caught me off guard Ahh
Oooh, I can't believe you, caught me off guard
Nooo oooh
Nooo oooh
Ahhh ooh
