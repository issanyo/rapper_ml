[Verse 1]
Lately I’m just a little selfish
But I guess I just can’t help it
Yea yea, admit the fact I like it
Don’t always wanna be the boss
Baby you can take me off my high horse
Take me by the hand and I might follow
You could be the one to take me on though
Cause you won’t give me what I want

[Pre Chorus]
I’m callin, no answer
You call back
I act like I forgot about you

[Chorus]
You’re not even mine
But my heart is like
A glass house that you’re
Just throwing stones through
Wo oh oh oh oh
I can’t walk away
And watch your heart break
But I’m standing here really intrigued by you

[Post Chorus]
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away
Steal my breath away
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away
Steal my breath away
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away
Steal my breath away
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away

[Verse 2]
I think you know exactly what you’re up to
I can never change you if I tried to
Maybe that’s the reason why I like you
Complicated’s just my type
Don’t let me set you off on failure
I know you don’t believe a word I tell you
I told you that I’m troubled but you know better
Don’t blame me when it’s that time

[Pre Chorus]
Cause we’re bagging heads
Before we even get anywhere at all

[Chorus]
You’re not even mine
But my heart is like
A glass house that you’re
Just throwing stones through
Wo oh oh oh oh
I can’t walk away
And watch your heart break
But I’m standing here really intrigued by you

[Post Chorus]
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away
Steal my breath away
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away
Steal my breath away
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away
Steal my breath away
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away

[Bridge]
Boy you got me fantasizing
See our bodies intertwining
When you put your lips on me
And our thoughts are so exciting
I don’t even wanna fight it
Wanna give you all of me
You know you’d better better better do me right
Cause I never let anyone inside

[Chorus]
You’re not even mine
But my heart is like
A glass house that you’re
Just throwing stones through
Wo oh oh oh oh
I can’t walk away
And watch your heart break
But I’m standing here really intrigued by you

[Post Chorus]
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away
Steal my breath away
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away
Steal my breath away
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away
Steal my breath away
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away
You steal my breath away (steal my breath away)
You steal my breath away (steal my breath away)
You steal my breath away
You steal my breath away
