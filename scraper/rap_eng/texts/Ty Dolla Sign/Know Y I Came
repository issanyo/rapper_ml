[Intro]
First I get my dick sucked
Then hit her from the back right

[Hook]
I'mma roll up this J, then pour us a drink
Stop acting stupid, you know why I came
You know why I came, know why I came
Stop acting stupid, you know why I came

[Verse 1]
Baby you know why I came
Came for one thing
Don't make me wait too long, no!
Baby, we've been talking on the phone, texting
Now we're here in person
Don't talk about it, just be about it
I told her put it on my face
She told me tell me how it taste
I said good, I said good
She said daddy, come hit it
But that didn't sound right
First I get my dick sucked
Then hit her from the back right

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You know why I came, and I ain't gonna play games
I'mma put it to your back
I'mma make you scream my name
I'mma throw 'em all in the booty
I hope she ain't no groupie
She get her pussy straight to me
This know what she doing
I told her to put it on my face
She said tell me how it taste
I said good, I said good
She said daddy, come hit it
But that didn't sound right
Cause first I get my dick sucked
Then hit her from the back right

[Hook 2x]


First I get my dick sucked
Then hit her from the back, right?
Don't play no games
Know why I came
First I get my dick sucked
Then hit her from the back, right?

[Outro]
