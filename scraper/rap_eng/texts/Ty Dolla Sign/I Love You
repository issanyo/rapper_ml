[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
We could fly to Puerto Rico and fight a mosquito
Or lounge out in Cuba, even though it's illegal
Blowin' Cuban cigars, keepin' everythin' on the D-low
Or brag to your friends, "You never been here before?"
Baby, I love you, we're celebratin', I love you
Been doin' them squats, your ass tight as a glove
Fly like a dove, nobody fuckin' with us
I got the mean pipe but you supply me the drug
The pookie in New Jack City, the booty and tig ol' bitties
Blowin' the color purple like Danny Glover and Silly
Versace embedded in me, all of our clothin' silky
God took his time 'cause God damn, you pretty
And I just really wanna hold ya
I'ma make you say "Uuuh" like a No Limit soldier
Then ride her like a roller-coaster
I'ma beat, beat it down like a real man's supposed to

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Girl, it's you I'm ready to settle down with
And do some things we've never done before, yeah, girl
And baby, this a celebration to our love making tonight
'Cause I love you, I love you, babe, yeah, I love you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Look, house on the water like a casino
Vacation on private islands, notifyin' my P.O
Margiela the peacoat, pockets full of Doritos
Countin' all these Euros, they're like what the fuck is a C-Note?
Yachts with the clear water, it look like my chain
Cameras flashin', paparazzi, yeah, that looks like the fame
3 M on my jacket, you can't see me the same
Motivated, I'm avoidin' the lames but I'm lookin' for you
Ha, pretty brown nice thing
Rolex faces, bottles in them gold cases
It's ridiculous, with your body a nigga particular
That booty is big enough, she move it, I pick it up
Slow down, baby
Know a nigga singin', we gon' make some Motown babies
Ha, a nigga change the weather when I come out
If it's raining, baby, I'ma bring the sun out

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Girl, it's you I'm ready to settle down with
And do some things we've never done before, yeah, girl
And baby, this a celebration to our love making tonight
'Cause I love you, I love you, babe

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
You know I love ya
And I'm gon' love on you every chance that I get
Yeah, and ain't no way that I'm going to walk away
And throw it all away, oh yeah
And girl, I won't lie
And all that I get it, if you're mines I spend it on you
And every time that we fight
We just fuck and we make right back up

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Girl, it's you I'm ready to settle down with
And do some things we've never done before, yeah, girl
And baby, this a celebration to our love making tonight
'Cause I love you, I love you, babe
Girl, it's you I'm ready to settle down with
And do some things we've never done before, yeah, girl
And baby, this a celebration to our love making tonight
'Cause I love you, I love you, babe
