(Stretch)

[Bridge]
Girl, I've been thinking of ways, thinking of ways
Thinking of new ways to beat that pussy down

[Verse 1]
Said a nigga been stressing you out
(Always gotta hear that nigga mouth)
Imma come through when he leaves and stretch that pussy out
I brought my gun just in case
(I'll shoot that nigga in the face)
You don't even know your worth
(Need to put that nigga in his place)
Nigga stay all in your face
(You text me, "I miss your face")
We ain't got no worries
Imma take my time, don't rush me

Stretch it, stretch it out, stretch it, stretch it out
Imma stretch that pussy out, stretch it, stretch it out

[Pre-Hook]
Independent bitch, says she get her own shit
And she never got a handout
Got her own crib, she don't look like other bitches
Baby always gonna stand out
What a broke nigga gonna tell her?
When a rich nigga want you, she better

[Hook]
She better (x2)

[Verse 2]
Bitches ain't shit to a real nigga
Niggas ain't shit to a real bitch
We ain't got time for no games
Got her mind on her money on some real shit
These niggas wanna look like rappers
Spend money on their clothes than their own kids
Girl, you don't need a nigga like that
You need somebody that's gonna take care of business
That girl's an

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Outro]
She better twerk it for a real nigga
Drop it down for a real nigga
Pick it up for a real nigga
Back it up on a real nigga
Do a trick for a real nigga
Buy a fifth for a real nigga
Bring another bitch for a real nigga
Go on up for a real nigga
