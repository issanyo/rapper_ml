[Hook: Blaq Tuxedo]
Yeah we in this thang, girl we in this thang
And you know we gon' pour it up
Yeah we in this thang, money ain't no thang
So you know we gon' throw it up
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's a function at the hotel, hotel
Promise that you won't tell, won't tell
If we do it, we do it, we do it

[Verse 1: Blaq Tuxedo]
This is how we do it, it's Friday night
And I feel alright, the party's here on the west side
I'm fly, fresh prince, I like them girls rachet
Girl I wanna see you twerk sum
Throw it back, and I'ma have to hurt sum

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ty$]
Girl promise that you won't tell
But if my bitch find out, oh well
Since our e-mail I got from this all can tell
Charge me for smokin' inside the [?] coffee smell
Yeah sex on the balcony, people drivin' by watchin' me
Had your girl on top of me, and she put it down properly
Real bopperly, and she bout the beat while I put the broccoli
Met her at the colony, hit it from the back
You know I'm not talkin' side of me, finger in her booty though
I could tell a million and one stories bout these groupie hoes

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Iamsu!]
Rump shaker, rump shaker, one two check it
Thoroughly respect it, hate it get rejected
Cash for the necklace, I was throwin' money
Seem liked 60 seconds, it was gone in 60 seconds
No Nicolas Cage, Heartbreakers the clique and the gang
Rain on em, different world flow, Dwayne Wade on em
Tell yo girl shake it like a red nose
This flow will make her bend it like a elbow
I tell now lie when I'm in the booth, fly nigga, living proof
Lotta niggas telling lies, I be the living proof
So when you hear me just expect real
Bitch yo girl gon' feel me like ex peel

[Hook]
