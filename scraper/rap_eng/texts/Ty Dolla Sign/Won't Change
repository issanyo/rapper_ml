Verse 1:
My Blessings out to Judy, two of her sons died
So I thank the lord that I see the sun rise
Judy don't cry, the pain is hard to hide
I know it's rough mama, but keep hope alive
Pray for better days, to see them better days
I know the world is ugly, like FlavorFlav
But i've seen better, it'll get better
Do don't even sweat it, like a thick sweater
And tell my nigga Juvvy Rick to keep his head high
I know it's hard to see two of your bros die
Just heard shots by the dust town, and turn around and see your brother jump outta Fresh towns
Before he fucked the world, cause it's a cold bitch
With no panties on, and some wet lips
And she licked her lips and stared at me
And then the music and the lord saved me

Chorus:
You can try to take the boy out [of] the hood, but you can't take the hood out [of] the boy
It won't change, won't change
You can try to take him out the hood but it won't change, won't change ohhh

Verse 2:
Dayumm, ain't shit changed since I was little
My pops doing the same thing and I wish he wouldn't
My grandmother died way back in '97
But she stayed over my head and kept blessing
My brother in the pen, I can not stop stressing
85 to life, damn I think he got the message
Ay, but I keep your name floating on
TC48 hundred and you know it's on
I got a lot of niggas hating on me
Cause they say a nigga eating while they staying hungry
I've been on the block forever, nigga I ain't phony
Bitch I do this shit for real, you can ask my homies
Ha, blue chucks and my blue strings
Blue dickies, selling crack bitch I gang bang
And like 2Pac I don't see a damn change
That's why I pity Jay Kwon, that's a damn shame

Chorus

Verse 3:
Ugh, living life as a street nigga
Ever since I start like a beginner
Hungry nights when we couldn't even eat dinner
Life's a bitch so I fuck her, yea deep in her
Then they try to take the street side of me
Nigga hit licks and cashed out like a lottery
Woke up one morning at gunpoint
How would you feel if the police were up in your joint
Took my pops away for about 3 years
Every night a nigga cry more than 3 tears
I was good though, nigga start gang banging
Must have loved you every day till I started maintaining
Classes got ditched and homies got killed
Hurt is the perfect word a nigga felt
Then my nigga ace pops died and ever since then
We've been smoking like Popeyes

Chorus
