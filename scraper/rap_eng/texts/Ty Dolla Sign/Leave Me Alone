[Ty Dolla $ign]
Woah, woah
Woah (Fuck it you're responsibly high)

[Verse 1: Styles P]
We gon' get stoned, we gon' have a blast
We gon' light a half, take shrooms and do dabs
Fuck it 'bout the cash I just wanna laugh
Take edibles and THC pills before the bath
Catch me on a float, stonin' to our crew
Give a fuck what you talk about
I just wanna smoke
Give a fuck what you rappin' 'bout
I just wanna smoke
If we talkin' 'bout money, send a hunnid on the boat
Fuck around and leave New York
Hit the bands, start to grow
If they call me back East, then they better have a show
Told my nigga Bern, but let that shit burn
Ain't smokin' like as far as medicine's concerned

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Look leave me alone I'm just tryna smoke
Fuck what they talkin' about I'm just tryna smoke
Lil' bitch leave me alone yeah
Young nigga leave me alone yeah
Lil' bitch leave me alone yeah
Young nigga leave me alone yeah

[Verse 2: Berner]
We get high and watch the world spin
Dawg, fuck your girlfriend
I'm married to the game and I'll be high until the world end
Hit it with that Y, and let it get that lil' purp tint
Handful of cash as soon as the work kick
Let 'em grow their bagseed
I don't even talk much, I love to bag flex
As soon as my crop cuttin'
And if they get to trippin' in the club then I'm dippin'
All dudes in your section and I'm here with twenty bitches
I burn to get my mind right
Tell 'em what that vibe like
Me I'm on that BCP choco wildlife
Yeah you that sloppy drunk, kill my high tide
Leave me alone
I'mma take six cones to the dome

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Look leave me alone I'm just tryna smoke
Fuck what they talkin' about I'm just tryna smoke
Lil' bitch leave me alone yeah
Lil' nigga leave me alone yeah
Lil' bitch leave me alone yeah
Lil' nigga leave me alone yeah

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Always smokin' weed
Always roll up to the party, hella drunk when I don't need to
All them askin' for your number, don't feel like I need you
You look like a good waste of my time
And I been gettin' paper so long that I could use a piece of mind
Someone who could roll the weed soon as I'm flyin'
Know the grind, know how to unwind
And always gon' keep it real
We could go to the movies or we could just chill
You was there when I got the new whip, ain't even trip
Now we got so many you don't know which one to sit in
Bomb sex wll that's a given, innit?
Fuck what they sayin', look how they livin'

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Look leave me alone I'm just tryna smoke
Fuck what they talkin' about I'm just tryna smoke
Lil' bitch leave me alone yeah
Lil' nigga leave me alone yeah
Lil' bitch leave me alone yeah
Lil' nigga leave me alone yeah
