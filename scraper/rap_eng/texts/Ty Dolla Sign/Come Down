[Hook: PJ]
It ain't the size of the dog in 'em
It's the size of the fight in the dog
Baby you know, keep on climbing up
Keep on climbing if I fall, yeah
Cause, oh I won't, oh I won't, oh I won't, I won't come down
Oh I won't, oh I won't, oh I won't, I won't come down

[Verse 1: PJ]
See me stepin'out
They ain't understand but they get it now
Don't look like them girls on that radio
But I got the juice and you know they don't
When them Hollywood lights make you insecure
Don't you let anyone come for yours
From Carolina down to Hollywood
I'm doing it just cause they said I couldn't

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $isn]
We went straight to the T-O-P
And I brought all my niggas with me
Middle finger to all my enemies
They gon' hate but they can't stop me
We keep rising, and rising up like the curtain
Young nigga, know your worth, know your purpose
You ain't gotta play you worthless
Yeah, that right there, I know for certain

[Hook: PJ]
It ain't the size of the dog in 'em
It's the size of the fight in the dog
Baby you know, keep on climbing up
Keep on climbing if I fall, yeah
Cause, oh I won't, oh I won't, oh I won't, I won't come down
Oh I won't, oh I won't, oh I won't, I won't come down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I won't come down (hey)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I won't come down

[Verse 2: PJ]
I can't help it, I'm not sorry
Are you movin' or just stocking
Not gon' lie, been a hell of a year
But I'm moving up, yeah, the colder it gets
Riding high answers all the problems
I'mma get there in perfect timin'
Yeah, but I ain't winnin' yet
But put it on me if you placing a bet

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
And we'll never stop
Just like we'll never talk to the cops
Hopped in the Porsche from the bus stop
Went from Top Ramen to Mr Chow
I'm that nigga now, young PJ got this shit figured out
Keep on rising and climbing, keep on grinding and smiling

[Hook: PJ]
It ain't the size of the dog in 'em
It's the size of the fight in the dog
Baby you know I'll keep on climbing up
Keep on climbing if I fall, yeah
Cause, oh I won't, oh I won't, oh I won't, I won't come down
Oh I won't, oh I won't, oh I won't, I won't come down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I won't come down (hey)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I won't come down
