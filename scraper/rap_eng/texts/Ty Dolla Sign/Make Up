[Intro]
Call it up
Last night, ahh sounds

[Verse 1: Verse Simmonds]
I know that you fuck with me
Girl you know you stuck in me
We gon' make some love tonight
Might be on the drugs tonight
Girl why you trippin'? We just can't get it right
I paid attention, I just don't pay enough
Time to expensive, I just don't got it all
Let's not waste it on that petty shit
We should just fuck right now

[Pre-Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Man, I give up
Whatever it was it ain't work, ah

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds & Ty Dolla $ign]
I just wanna make up, I wanna make up
I just wanna make up, I wanna make up
I just wanna make up, I wanna make up
I wanna make up, I just wanna make up
I'm just tryna to make love when we link up
I'm just tryna to make love when we link up
I'm just tryna to make love when we link up
I'm just tryna to make love when we link up

[Verse 2: Verse Simmonds]
I don't wanna fight tonight
I'm just tryna vibe tonight
Tell me what I'm doing wrong
Come and let me do it right
We've been through up downs
We've been through long trials
Let's figure it out
Always the same shit, we could've been quit puttin' me out
Times too expensive
I just don't got it all
Let's not waste it on that petty shit
We should just fuck right now

[Pre-Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Man, I give up
Whatever it was it ain't work, ah

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds & Ty Dolla $ign]
I just wanna make up, I wanna make up
I just wanna make up, I wanna make up
I just wanna make up, I wanna make up
I wanna make up, I just wanna make up
I'm just tryna to make love when we link up
I'm just tryna to make love when we link up
I'm just tryna to make love when we link up
I'm just tryna to make love when we link up
