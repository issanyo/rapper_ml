[Intro: Wale]
You got the game all the way fucked up, homes

[Verse 1: Wale]
You chillin' with a tilley, feelin' better
Come up in my city we can see who really spillin’
See who really got it, I’m livin’ quite different
Cause ain’t nobody chillin’ till I’m getting fifty million
Grew up with some chimps, grew up with gorillas
Blew up in this music she couldn’t tell the difference
Oops I might get her, oops I might get her
Oops some molly on her, somebody tell her she trippin’
Oops I might get her, oops I might get her
So tell if she celibate, why am I buying her dinner?
Bitch you playing bad, hit the ass with the “thought it”
Fakin' with the bag and you mans nigga, thought it
Nigga, shit, really? You ain’t bought it? Nigga, thought it
I see how I call it then record it nigga, nigga, thought it

[Pre-Hook: Joe Moses]
We don’t believe you (We don’t believe you)
We don’t believe you (We don’t believe you)
We don’t believe you (We don’t believe you)
We don’t believe you (We don’t believe you)

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign & Wale]
Woah, I know you see it
Throw it, throw it, throw it Ohh, ohh
I know you see it
Big shit, real shit, throw it, nigga throw it
You know you see it
Throw it, throw it, throw it Ohh, ohh
I know you see it
Big shit, real shit, throw it, nigga throw it

[Verse 2: Wale]
Clearly I’m a genius, well let her bother me then
Sold more arenas than Balenciaga this season
It's not a problem either, got all the Riccardo Tisci
It's not a problem either, Gallardo got all the feature
Vroom on a nigga, skrt on them hoes
Got a lot of fools, I ain’t worried ‘bout them, no
Every blue moon plus that double Lamb blue
Coming out the booth still smelling like boof, true
And everything cool, Instagram bitches always shy and playing cute
You know what hoes be like? The hoes be like
I’m like: “Hoe, shut up. You like the hoes we like”
Fake bag, fake shoes when you bought it
Faking like they bad but I’m saying “you a thottie”
And everything rented, she ain’t bought it, nigga, thought it
I see it how I call it, then record it, then you got it, thought it

[Pre-Hook: Joe Moses]
We don’t believe you (We don’t believe you)
We don’t believe you (We don’t believe you)
We don’t believe you (We don’t believe you)
We don’t believe you (We don’t believe you)

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign & Wale]
Woah, I know you see it
Throw it, throw it, throw it, ohh, ohh
I know you see it
Big shit, real shit, throw it, nigga throw it
You know you see it
Throw it, throw it, throw it, ohh, ohh
I know you see it
Big shit, real shit, throw it, nigga throw it

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Pull up, bet you thought I wouldn’t
Twenty bottles, bet you thought I wouldn’t
Took your bitch, bet you thought I wouldn’t
Woah, I know you see it
