[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Medication - your medication makes me high
Just be patient - I'm like a patient trying to find
Levitation - Run your fingers down my spine
Elevation - your medication makes me high, yeah

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I fell in love with the sativa
Where you been, nice to meet ya
It done been so long to meet ya
Obsessed with your features
You got all different flavours
You got that loudly speakers
The best friend Keisha
Know how to knock em out they sneakers
Like that Louis XIII but she nothing like my ex though
She remind of Gelato
Got me drinking out the bottle
She got me swerving on this shawty
Her name was Indica
I tried to tell her I was sorry
She said that's the end of us
But I can't help but keep on rolling up
Medication keep me going up
Meditation come on breathe with us
No ventilation keep the windows up

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Medication - your medication makes me high
Just be patient - I'm like a patient trying to find
Levitation - Run your fingers down my spine
Elevation - your medication makes me high, hey

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
Such a short way up and such a long way down
Chalice it a bubble like we deh a Ray Town
Di way yuh supâ€™n nuff it haffi way by pound
Inna fields of marijuana that is my playground
I love you Mary Jane!
You're the prettiest of flowers, girl me can't complain
When I'm with you I feel so high I rise above the rain
And you no do people damage, like that bitch cocaine, no
And leave them lonely, feeling only pain
Cause your DNA is of the highest strain
Your effect is so potent, it's so insane
You so gummy and sticky like a plasticine
When me grind out your body, only stems remain
And to love you is so risky, I might get detained
You always keep me flying on the highest plane
And anybody know, will always proclaim

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Medication - your medication makes me high
Just be patient - I'm like a patient trying to find
Levitation - Run your fingers down my spine
Elevation - your medication makes me high, hey

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, you so fire, you so fire
The only thing I think of when I need to unwind
See I've been going crazy 'cause you've been on my mind
And something is wrong but to me it's not a crime
You can take me places, just look at their faces
Plus you're so good, they don't know your taste is
Dealing with you, complex
Nothing but you, basic
You the real deal, I can never fake it
I fell in love with the indica
Ever since I was young I've been into ya
Even when you're almost done, don't wanna finish ya
It don't matter where you at, I'mma pick you up
Yeah, I'mma pick you up
And we're in for a good night
I'mma wrap you up real tight
And if things get dark, I give you a light
Keep you with me, you've been on mind, all night
'Cause you're my -

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Medication - your medication makes me high
Just be patient - I'm like a patient trying to find
Levitation - Run your fingers down my spine
Elevation - your medication makes me high, hey
