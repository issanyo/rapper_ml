[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Aye, she know I'm watching
But she know I'm watching
No pecans, just almonds, cashews, and peanuts
Nothing, never mind, yeah

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
She know I'm watchin', but she know I'm watching
She pussy popping, she with her friends, I got options, yeah
She know I'm watching, she walking different cause I'm watching
Ooh, she know I'm watching, I hope, I'm watching

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I put that pussy in a coffin, make her deep throat 'til she coughin'
Mink coat made of ostrich, I could tell she a boss bitch
Private shoppin' at the suffrages, appetizers, and beverages
It's the movement, I'm the president
Rich nigga who she messing with, the Dolla a boss
You makin' a movie, makin' a movie, winning an Oscar
We did it again, we did it again, cause Dolla a monster
I'm blowing the bands, I'm blowing these bands
She know that I'm watching, yeah

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
She know I'm watching but she know I'm watching
She pussy popping, she with her friends, I got options, yeah
She know I'm watching, she walking different cause I'm watching
Ooh, she know I'm watching, I hope, I'm watching

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, she know I'm popping, it look like a Neimanâ€™s in my closet
Ooh, you need to stop it
Lights on when we do it, we could watch it
Check, check, check
Buy her some heels and get all her bands up
She know the deal, now I got my cash up
Yeah, I'm on the pill with purp in the glass cup
We goin' up in this bitch like it's NASA
She like the way that I talk, ayy
I like the way that she walk, ayy
I put that dick all up in her, ayy
She trippin', I know it's my fault, ayy
I've been gettin' to the money, moolah
Chillin' and playing my part, ayy
Throw it at me like a pitcher, ayy
I knock it straight out the park, gone
Hold up, she brought her friends and now I got options
I call an Audible on her, no problem
Girl with the gang and we on the island
She ride that dick like a stallion
The molly up in her, she wylin'

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
She know I'm watching but she know I'm watching
She pussy popping, she with her friends, I got options, yeah
She know I'm watching, she walking different cause I'm watching
She know I'm watching, I hope, I'm watching
