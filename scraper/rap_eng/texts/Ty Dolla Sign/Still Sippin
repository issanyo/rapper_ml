Welcome back to the Beach House
[Hook]
I woke up, I’m still sippin (I woke up, I’m still sippin)
My bitch told me that I’m trippin (My bitch told me that I’m trippin)
I woke up, I’m still sippin (I woke up, I’m still sippin)
My bitch told me that I’m trippin (My bitch told me that I’m trippin)
[Bridge]
I’m getting tho'd for no reason (no reason)
That purple codeine got me fiendin' (codeine got me fiendin')
Them purple moon rocks keep me up (purple moon rocks keep me up)
All we do is drugs and fuck

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
No talkin – ass up, face down (ass up, face down)
She ride on it like a greyhound (She ride on it like a greyhound)
And I grind on it like a skateboard (I grind on it like a skateboard)
She make these other niggas pay for it like a landlord (pay for it like a landlord)
And I’mma drop a 4 in the deuce (4 in the deuce)
And a Sprite of Mountain Dew (Sprite of Mountain Dew)
And we could drop a molly in the goose (molly in the goose)
And I’mma hit it til it’s loose (hit it til it’s loose)
Yep yep, drop the full when I do it (full when I do it)
Put a molly in the coup (molly in the coup)
Then I took her to the room (took her to the room)

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
I had to slow down the sippin
She had my attitude straight trippin
I had to slow it down and then drink
‘Cause I was gaining too much weight
Sip drink with my niggas, I don’t sip drink with these hoes
I’m fuckin one of her bitches and she ain’t even much know
Uh, her drink on the stomach, let it drip to the cat
Hit it from the back, put my finger in her ass
Man I’m doin her and her friend like that
Hold up, but I ain’t let them bitches sip it
‘Cus both them bitches lifted
They even let me film it
And I fucked her part then they both got children

[Hook]
