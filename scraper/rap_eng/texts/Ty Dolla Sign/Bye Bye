*Tires peel, gunshots, return fire*

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm sayin' bye bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye, aye
This is for my homies
This is for my homies, well well
See you when I get there
Bye bye bye bye bye bye

[Verse 1: Scotty ATL]
Had a vision thought I seen you rollin' yesterday man was on Wesley Chapel
All I could hear is you yellin' "Street", poppin' shit sayin' niggas cappin'
Broke my heart just cried today, it's been a couple weeks, still feelin' weak
Tryna hold my head and not feel defeat, shit fuck wit me I don't understand
Prayed to God like "why so soon?" we were comin' up you had blowed up
Vibe Mag, 2016, together Facetime, you was lit as fuck
Didn't get to say bye to you dawg, workin' in tune spot for hours, tradin' off game
Wish you could see how they fuck wit you, while we prepare for your visual I bought me a flame
This is my plan, I'ma come up for the both of us, so drop off your seasoned intuition
Man I been missin' the fuck out you homie, aye save me a spot I'ma see you again
Street money that's forever, Cool Club we love you my nigga you switched up the game
Smokin' a fat blunt of that Jane, just to maintain, ease up the pain

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm sayin' bye bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye bye bye, aye
This is for my homies
This is for my homies, well well
See you when I get there
Bye bye bye bye bye bye

[Verse 2]
Crazy thing is we lost Josh and just a week before we lost Jermaine
All of this is round the same time Bank passed man, that how the nigga bring
On the verge, I was on the verge, 'Maine was my biggest fan and my friend
He had the Cool Club tat 'fore I did, if he had it man would give
See understand he would deal wit a lot, cryin' for help, misunderstood he felt
We would talk in the hood, I told him bout bull strengthen up ya mind
One night I was on my way to meet the homie, give him some tickets later to the show
Only bout fifteen fuckin' minutes, I called his brother phone, he was gone
Never thought I would reach to his mama, you never know the end of the song
Next week heard Dre passed man we gotta stop the violence and the wrong
Hold ya head if you lost a close one, God know the bigger picture and the plan
Soon as the money come got a real glance of what life bout from a stand

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm sayin' bye bye bye bye bye (cause I didn't get to it)
Bye bye bye bye bye bye (if only I didn't)
Bye bye bye bye bye bye (just one more chance)
Bye bye bye bye bye bye, aye (oooh this is for my homies)
This is for my homies (ooh yeah)
This is for my homies, well well (well well)
See you when I get there (yeaaah)
Bye bye bye bye bye bye (oooohh)

[Outro: Scotty ATL]
