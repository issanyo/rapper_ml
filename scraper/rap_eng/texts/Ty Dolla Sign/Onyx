[Intro: DJ Drama & Ty Dolla $ign]
Trigga, Dolla $ign and August
(I met her at Onyx)
What we on tonight? DJ Drama!
(I met her at Onyx)

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Pull up, park it
These haters don't wanna see me pop my shit
Set it up, out here
And I'm on, got that bag in my pocket
I let my Rollie keep my timer
I got a blunt full of marijuana
She put that monkey on my banana
And weâ€™ll be fuckin' til tomorrow, oh, yeah
Hey, girl, where your man at?
I don't mind, I can ride behind that
We gon' get it, girl, they can't stop that
Throw these bands, cause I'ma get em right back

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
And if it takes all night, I know we gon' get up
Cause no matter where you are, I'll pick you up
I met her at Onyx (Oh), I seen her at Follies (Oh)
I tipped her at Magic (Oh),  Miami King Of Diamonds (Oh)

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
She wet, she sexy
I came in 500 100's all super blunted
She ready, she ready, wet and ready
I got money, I blow that shit
Like Hail Mary I throw that shit
I smoke good like I grow that shit
And she a bad bitch, and she know that shit
Catch it when I throw that dick
Her ass big, girl show that shit
Pretty pussy licks, takin' kissy picks
Tongue slick as thick and she kiss the dick
Girl be gone with your nasty ass
Me and other niggas, we have the cash
Bitch came back with a plastic bag

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Trey Songz]
And if it takes all night, I know we gon' get up
Cause no matter where you are, I'll pick you up
I met her at Onyx (Oh), I seen her at Follies (Oh)
(Oh, yes I did, oh, yes I did)
I tipped her at Magic (Oh), Miami King Of Diamonds (Oh)

[Verse 3: August Alsina]
In Atlanta, real nigga in the buildin'
Bag full of dollar bills
And her ass so fat, and the titties on stack
I don't care if they ain't real
But you look good, feel good, bet you suck and fuck good
If it take all night, I'ma find out
Take you to the crib with the view girl
And I beat it till you tap out
Roll out, put your face in the pillow
Neighbors gon' see us, while we fuckin' in the window
Gonna readjust your spine, girl
Wanna hear you tell me that it's mine, girl

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Trey Songz]
And if it takes all night, I know we gon' get up
Cause no matter where you are, I'll pick you up
I met her at Onyx (Oh), I seen her at Follies (Oh)
I tipped her at Magic (Oh), Miami King Of Diamonds (Oh)
