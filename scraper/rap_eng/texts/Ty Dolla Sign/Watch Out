[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Watch out, watch out, know I got to watch out
I don’t leave the crib unless I got that Glock out
Watch out, watch out, know I got to watch out
Snake ass niggas hating so I got to watch out
Watch out, watch out, know I got to watch out
Haters taking pictures so you know I got to watch out
Watch out, watch out, know I got to watch out
Bitches plotting on me so you know I got to watch out

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Feeling like the shit cause I made my first mil
Feeling like the shit cause I always stay f'real
Your bitch let me fuck cause I’m that nigga
You can have her back when I get done with her
Got to watch out for these police ass niggas
Cuffing on these hoes, they still choosing on niggas
Got to watch out when I’m riding top down
Stay sun down when I ride through the town
And if you don’t know now then bitch you better ask somebody
If you don’t know now then bitch you better ask somebody

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Watch out, watch out, know I got to watch out
I don’t leave the crib unless I got that Glock out
Watch out, watch out, know I got to watch out
Snake ass niggas hating so I got to watch out
Watch out, watch out, know I got to watch out
Haters taking pictures so you know I got to watch out
Watch out, watch out, know I got to watch out
Bitches plotting on me so you know I got to watch out

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Feeling like the shit cause I just sold 100 packs
Nigga we can go to war, nigga I got 100 straps
Old bitches texting me, naw I don’t want 'em back
Pants hanging stupid low, cause I got them stupid racks
Watch out, it’s hot out
It’s cops out, it’s ops out
Nigga run up on me, I swear to god it’s hollows out
Chopper get to spraying
Christmas time, I bring that lighter out
Brand new AK47, on the front got knife out
Two for the five just to keep the block rolling
Baby mama suck my dick for a cheeseburger
Little niggas gettin' little money, get older
Spend bout 10 ten racks just on some sodas

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Watch out, watch out, know I got to watch out
I don’t leave the crib unless I got that Glock out
Watch out, watch out, know I got to watch out
Snake ass niggas hating so I got to watch out
Watch out, watch out, know I got to watch out
Haters taking pictures so you know I got to watch out
Watch out, watch out, know I got to watch out
Bitches plotting on me so you know I got to watch out

[Verse 3: Que]
Noodles on the chopstick, ready for the conflict
All my niggas convicts, blow you out your Rob Smith
Rolex don’t tick nigga, bitch four fifths nigga
Heard you got the chopper with me, blow your ass to bits nigga
Got to keep the pole, for these dog hoes
On some sneaky shit, so I keep the stick
Be one deep with it, be myself and I
Police had a nigga plotting like a spy
Do not call my phone, talking all hot
Tryna get the drop, I can smell the cops
Find a cover, different spot, different stoves and pots
Supercharge drops, and I keep the knot
I got voices in my head, feel it in my intuition
Living nightmares when I sleep, all my closest partners snitching
Pops told me go get it and flip it and go get it again
Mama told me watch for snakes cause most of the time it’s your friends
So I

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Watch out, watch out, know I got to watch out
I don’t leave the crib unless I got that Glock out
Watch out, watch out, know I got to watch out
Snake ass niggas hating so I got to watch out
Watch out, watch out, know I got to watch out
Haters taking pictures so you know I got to watch out
Watch out, watch out, know I got to watch out
Bitches plotting on me so you know I got to watch out
