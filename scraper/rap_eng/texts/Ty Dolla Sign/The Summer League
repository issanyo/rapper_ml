[Intro]
Live from the BF Coliseum, southeast DC, Barry Farms where I was worked, born and raised! Wale, Kanye West and Dolla $ign! DC and Chi Town! Live inside the gates! Welcome to the big show!

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Pull up on you, hop out stuntin'
The money keep comin', it keep on comin'
The money keep comin', it keep on comin'
All my bitches love me, the money keep comin'

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Woah, you was just alright
Yeah you, okay
You know I could do this type of shit all night
Anyway, I wanna see you with the lights on, right now, for real
You got everybody watchin' like the fight on, god damn
Keep on, keep on thuggin', keep on, keep on thuggin'
While the money keep on comin', keep on, keep on comin'

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Pull up on you, hop out stuntin'
The money keep comin', it keep on comin'
The money keep comin', it keep on comin'
All my bitches love me, the money keep comin'

[Verse 2: Wale]
Everything fast, everything fact
Money in the bank, put away the cash
Pedal to the floor, foot on the gas
300 on the... God damn
Slippin' and slidin'
Made it to the top, but my mama from Naija
And they just wanna watch shit
She used to flower bomb, now that candy is Prada
I tell her, "keep on comin'"
And when she on top, man she keep on cummin'
And I can't keep her off of me
Keep on, keep on comin'

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Pull up on you, hop out stuntin'
The money keep comin', it keep on comin'
The money keep comin', it keep on comin'
All my bitches love me, the money keep comin'
