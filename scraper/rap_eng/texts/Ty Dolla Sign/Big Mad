[Intro]
Everything foreign

Ha, ha, ha

[Chorus: Reese LAFLARE]
Y'all niggas be big mad
We can pull up on you and we fix that
Slide up on you, Lambo watch me whip that
I know you hate it how a nigga did that
That's why you B.I.G, M.A.D, you big mad
We can pull up on you and we fix that
Slide up on you, Lambo watch me whip that
My old girl hate my new girl, say she big trash
That's why she B.I.G, S.A.D, she big sad

[Verse 1: Reese LAFLARE]
Nigga why you big mad?
With your bitch ass
Lookin' big sad
When my wrist flash
My girl hop out she look explosive
Catfish bitch, your girl don't take no close-ups
I got B.I.G grass nigga
Yellow bih like cab nigga
Goin' up under no cap
I rent coupe then slack
Hit a big lick then dip
Had to up that off my hip
Left ol' girl on read
Ain't text back now she big sick
I know that they prayed on my demise
Hatin' nigga, I see all that bullshit in your eyes, yeah, yeah
Tell 'em what they want, you tell 'em lies
Y'all niggas some knock-offs
I just knock them hits off

[Chorus: Reese LAFLARE]
Y'all niggas be big mad
We can pull up on you and we fix that
Slide up on you, Lambo watch me whip that
I know you hate it how a nigga did that
That's why you B.I.G, M.A.D, you big mad
We can pull up on you and we fix that
Slide up on you, Lambo watch me whip that
My old girl hate my new girl, say she big trash
That's why she B.I.G, S.A.D, she big sad

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh they big mad
They'd rather see me doin' bad, back on Second Ave
They'd rather see me in a Honda instead of this Turbo Porsche
I came a long way from McDonald's to this five course
I got 'em so B.I.G, M.A.D, they envy us
I'm gettin' money to these haters I'm oblivious
We got the draco, with extendo, keep a pick on us
Is he dumb? Is he stupid?
He an idiot
My slime Reese hit me up
You know I'm pullin' up
It got 'em big mad, big mad
Back to back the Bentley trucks
Got 'em big mad I could tell we still don't give no fuck
Got 'em big mad Mr. 424 with Saint Laurent

[Chorus: Reese LAFLARE & Ty Dolla $ign]
Y'all niggas be big mad (Dolla $ign)
We can pull up on you and we fix that
Slide up on you, Lambo watch me whip that
I know you hate it how a nigga did that
That's why you B.I.G, M.A.D, you big mad
We can pull up on you and we fix that
Slide up on you, Lambo watch me whip that
My old girl hate my new girl, say she big trash
That's why she B.I.G, S.A.D, she big sad

[Verse 3: Vory]
You M.A.D, that shit S.A.D
Diamonds hit like MLB
Catch an opp on sight, yeah nigga that’s a DOA (bow bow)
Break that check down with the hitters do that AOD (sheesh)
And I can’t wait for such and such to be released
I know all your shooters vegan they don't want no beef
They don't want no smoke, big Glock I tote (blah, blah, blah)
Money dance on that cash, just last year I was broke
Size a nigga up, yeah he get tailored
And my bitch told me to stop doin' these lil broke ass niggas favors
A lot of niggas say I’m lucky I’m just blessed and highly favored
Out in LA with them clippers fuck around and get you tapered

[Chorus: Reese LAFLARE]
Y'all niggas be big mad
We can pull up on you and we fix that
Slide up on you, Lambo watch me whip that
I know you hate it how a nigga did that
That's why you B.I.G, M.A.D, you big mad
We can pull up on you and we fix that
Slide up on you, Lambo watch me whip that
My old girl hate my new girl, say she big trash
That's why she B.I.G, S.A.D, she big sad
