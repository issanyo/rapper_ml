[Intro: Tank]
When we
When we
Mmm
When we
Go

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
I love the way you fuck me
I love the way you fuck me
But you don't understand its way more than fucking
When I fuck you
I would cross the ocean for you
Stroking through the ocean for you
And then I rub the lotion on you
You got a lot of lotion on you
I want to see the moon shine on you
Can I see the moon shine on you?
A little more lotion on you
Tryna take my time on you
Baby tell me

[Pre-Chorus: Tank & Trey Songz]
Who came to make sweet love? Not me
Who came to kiss and hug? Not me
Who came to beat it up? Rocky
And don't use those hands to put up that gate and stop me

[Chorus: Tank & Trey Songz]
When we fuck
When we fuck
When we fuck (oh)
When we fuck (oh)
I could be aggressive (I can be)
I can be a savage (I can be )
I just need your blessin (I just need your)
Say that I can have it, yeah
When we fuck
When we fuck

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Hit it on the stairs, then I smack it to the room
Had that coochie leaking, lick it all on my Gucci shoes
Kissing on your neck, tell me that I'm too deep
Need to tell your ex to leave you alone, he a creep
Ass up, face down
Ride me like a pony
These niggas so funny
Treat you like a trophy
You know I picked up when the phone ring
You know I go deep till I make you scream
You say my D-Game I'm amazing
Oh, D-Game go strong
Fuck it up all night long
Beat it up, get piped down
Oh, D-Game go strong
Fuck it up all night long
Beat it up, get piped down

[Chorus: Tank]
I could be aggressive (I could be aggressive)
I can be a savage (I can be a savage)
I just need your blessin (I just need your blessin)
Say that I can have it (Say that I can have i)
When we fuck
When we fuck

[Bridge: Tank]
Face down, ass up
I'ma pull all of my face in
You cumin' while I keep tasting
Now I'm breaking in, you a big girl you take it?
I'ma layin, I think I love you I'm sayin' it
It's that kind of fucking that will make you make me No.1 on your list
It's that kind of fucking that I make you question who have been fucking with
You got plenty miles and baggage
But I could still make you a savage
Sponsor you make you the baddest
Have you screamin' out "you can have it"

[Chorus: Tank]
When we fuck
When we fuck (we fuck)
When we fuck (fucking you darl')
When we fuck
I could be aggressive
I can be a savage
I just need your blessin' (I just need your blessin')
Say that I can have it, yeah
When we fuck (fuckin' around)
When we fuck

[Outro: Tank]
