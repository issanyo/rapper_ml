[Verse 1: Tone Stith]
I love your body even when you're not trying
Say you don't exercise, well girl, I don't buy it
Hop out the car, girl, damn you look like a model
You the blueprint every girl need to follow
It's the way that you talk, plus that dress you got on
And the way that you walk, you ain't doin' nothin' wrong
Go on and put that on me, take your time, girl slowly
Talkin' 'bout it all week, you gon' have to show me, yeah, oh

[Chorus: Tone Stith]
I can't get it out of my head, no
All the freaky things you've done said
Now we're all alone in here
Take it all off, don't be scared to take it off, girl

[Verse 2: Tone Stith]
Your body is calling me, yeah
Anything you want, girl you'll get it now
I'ma make it hard to leave, oh-oh
I'm stayin' in, gonna lock it down
I got what you want
You don't need your phone
Don't nobody gotta know that we got nothin' on
Ain't gon' hold back, and girl, I'm good for that
All I'm trying to say is that I

[Chorus: Tone Stith]
I can't get it out of my head (Oh no, no, no, no)
All the freaky things you've done said (Oh no, oh yeah)
Now we're all alone in here (Woo-hoo)
Take it all off, don't be scared to take it off, girl (Ahh)
I'ma lay it down in your bed (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let you run your fingers through my hair (Yeah, oh)
Now we're all alone in here (Oh yeah)
Take it all off, don't be scared to take it off, oh yeah

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Take it all off like we at Follies
Take it all of like we at AOD
Monday night at Magic City
She said, "Dolla, you got that magic D"
Hit your phone, better answer me
Get it wet in advance for me
Hit it slow, til' you tell me, "Boy go fast"
Tattoo my name on your flesh
Leave yo' exes alone, they all trash
You deserve a real one even if you ain't got a real ass
Drippin' in Provocateur for me
Bust it open on the floor for me
Girl, I bet you can't do that on a D
Show me you a savage, you remind me of Blake Lively

[Bridge: Tone Stith]
Take it all off for me, for me, for me
(Baby, can you take it off, take it off?)
Take it all off for me, for me, for me
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, woo-woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
Take it all off for me, for me, for me (Take it all off, oh yeah)
Take it all off for me, for me, for me, for me (Ahh)

[Chorus: Tone Stith]
I can't get it out of my head
All the freaky things you've done said (Ahh)
Now we're all alone in here (Oh)
Take it all off, don't be scared to take it off, girl (Ooh, no, no, no)
I'mA lay it down in your bed (In your bed, girl)
Let you run your fingers through my hair (Woo, yeah)
Now we're all alone in here
Take it all off, don't be scared to take it off, oh yeah
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
