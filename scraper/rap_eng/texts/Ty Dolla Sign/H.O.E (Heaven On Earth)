[Verse 1: LunchMoney Lewis]
Told my mama that I met a girl
That I wanna make my wife
She sleepy, but she come and see me
When I hit her up on a late night
I wanna take a bite, Klondike
You the only one I want in my life
She sweet and sexy, thick and independent
Lookin' at your jeans like, "How you get up in it?" baby

[Chorus: LunchMoney Lewis]
I can't live a day without you
And I swear, you're like a dream come true
And after all, all of the things we've been through
Just to put in words, a little heaven on, heaven on earth

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Told my daddy
That I think I found the girl
I wanna have my son with
She freaky every time she see me
We gon' probably end up making love
I gotta have that lil baby love
I told lil baby she can trust Dolla, yeah
I'm just being honest when I tell ya

[Chorus: LunchMoney Lewis & Ty Dolla $ign]
I can't live a day without you
And I swear, you're like a dream come true
And after all, all of the things we've been through
Just to put in words, a little heaven on, heaven on earth
Heaven (heaven), heaven on earth (heaven)

[Bridge: LunchMoney Lewis]
You my slice of apple pie
My fireworks for 4th of July
Your onion booty make me wanna cry
Lately have I told you that I love you, love you, love you?

[Chorus: LunchMoney Lewis & Ty Dolla $ign]
I can't live a day without you
And I swear, you're like a dream come true
And after all, all of the things we've been through
Just to put in words, a little heaven on, heaven on earth
Heaven (heaven), heaven on earth (heaven)
Just to put in words, a little heaven on, heaven on earth
Heaven
Heaven
Heaven
Heaven on earth
