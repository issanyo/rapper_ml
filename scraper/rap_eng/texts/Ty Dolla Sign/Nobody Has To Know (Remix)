[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl, Girl take it off for a young
Freaky things that you do with your tongue
Up and down the pole like a stripper
Ass up, face in the pillow
Poppin n poppin, the pussy poppin on a handstand
And I just be your nigga, I can be your man
Sex so good, make you say you love me
Hoooll up, ain't you say you've had a boyfriend
And I likeee, I likee the way that you ride, the way that you kisshieul
And you likeee, you likee the way I get money, the way I boss up (yeaah)
And when I hit it real fast from the back
Now you make that ass clap
And you look back at it
I should've take a photo
(But nobody has to know...)

[Chorus: Kranium]
Nobody haffi know seh me and you a fuck
Nobody haffi know seh yuh a give it up 
Nobody haffi know seh yo come over mi yard
Baby take off your drawers
Nobody haffi know seh me and you a fuck
Nobody haffi know seh yuh a give it up 
Nobody haffi know seh yo come over mi yard
Baby take off your drawers

[Verse 3: Kranium]
Baby, ride me like a stallion
Fuck me like a number one
Bet you speak in a tongues
When mi use mi cockey, play guitar wit your lungs
Hey gyal mi a go shift your womb
When you feel the length of di broom
Transform like Tarzan
Bet you never get such fuck from a maga man

[Chorus: Kranium]
Nobody haffi know seh me and you a fuck
Nobody haffi know seh yuh a give it up 
Nobody haffi know seh yo come over mi yard
Baby take off your drawers
Nobody haffi know seh me and you a fuck
Nobody haffi know seh yuh a give it up 
Nobody haffi know seh yo come over mi yard
Baby take off your drawers

[Outro: Kranium]
Whoo whooa You know I love you baby
The way you ride me baby, drives me crazy
