[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]

Girl you actin' stupid
I think you kinda clueless
I don't wanna fuck with you no more
You playin' hella games, Nintendo
Girl you actin' childish
Nintendo
Girl you actin' childish
Games, Nintendo
Girl you actin' childish
I don't wanna fuck with you no more
You playin' hella games, Nintendo
Girl you actin' childish

Girl you actin' childish (whoa)
Girl you actin' childish (whoa, yeah, yeah)
Girl you actin' childish, childish, childish
Girl you actin' childish, childish, childish

[Verse: J-wiz]

Girl you actin' childish
Bet you won't do it for your man
But you would do it for the gram
Fronting like you got shit, Talking all that hot shit girl
I'll introduce you to a fan, baby cool that ass down
Yeah i'll cool that ass down, Shake it baby move that ass around, baby move that ass around
I'm the coolest hands down
I'm the coolest hands down
(I'm the coolest hands down)
Don't worry where my hands go (don't worry about it)
I'm trying to hit it like a banjo
On the table, on the floor, In the bando
6 9 head first like a kangol
(Name a place)
Where i can't go
Overseas, sunshine get a tan though
Tell me if you with it, it's a plan though
Truth be told you ain't gotta leave your man no

[Hook]

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign] (x2)

Why you wanna
Play the games on me?
Girl you fuckin' with a grown man
And I ain't got time for that no
