We used to be cool. (Mann)

We used to go party
Now I'm in the club all alone
Y'all reminisce
Y'all reminisce over you much, girl
Y'all reminisce

[Verse 1 -- Mann]
I went on Facebook the other day
And in my news feed I see her updates
Talking 'bout how much she loves that new guy she with
He probably some old punk sucker behind her shit
I sent some messages, really just trying to get our relationship back
She ain't reply to it
She hit me today, and I was like, I knew it
She mad like Kim but still in love with the kid
She said, get over myself, cause she over me and
She finally in a relationship she deserves to be in
We never gon' get back together, so please stop trying
We are a done deal, we had our time
Then I lost my mind, I lost my mind
Now I can't seem to get this girl of my mind
Yeah, I sit in reminisce over about my ex all the time
But you don't hear me 'though

[Verse 2 -- Mann]
We used to, talk about our future
"Whoâ€™d of thought the present was all we had in the past
Whatever happened to us, it all just happened so fast
If I had the chance, I would love to go back
To them days we used to chill
I made her feel the best way she could feel
I wasn't ready for a real relationship
That's something I regret, I feel stupid, still
Her love was amazing
On every occasion
Knew I was on something
When we started dating
Her hearth was broken
So we couldn't stay friends
Been a minute and, it ain't been the same sense
Then I lost my mind, I lost my mind
Now I can't seem to get this girl of my mind
Yeah, I sit in reminisce over about my ex all the time
But you don't hear me 'though

Yeah, I really want that old thing back
Now I got to find a new love, yeah
