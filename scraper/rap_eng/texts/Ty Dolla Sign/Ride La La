[Verse 1: Ty$]
Look haha, Yeaaa
Naah, you ain't going no where
Started being friends, now we fucking when we wanna
Very outspoken, so she tell me how she feel
Gotta hustle full-time, so she don't even go there
Life of entertaining, never said it's gonna be fair
But still she fucked with me, held me down, and stuck with me
Always worth while, so I fuck with you instead
Gotcha back, holla' at me when it's code red
Spread your wings and glide baby, I'll be right beside you
And I'll be at your rescue if them niggas ever tryed you
Looking at your face and no, I can never lie to you
I'd rather keep it real, stick with you, Ima die with you
No more playing games, we making it official
I'm letting it be know that I'm really fucking with you
[Joe Moses:]
So when I say I'm leaving she say
"Ima slide with you cuz nigga, ima ride la la, always ride with you"

[Hook]
Girl you ain't gotta worry, just call me when you need it woaah
Baby, you know ima ride la la ride, ride with you
You know ima ride la la ride, ride with you
You know ima ride la la ride, ride with you
So when I say I'm leaving tell me you gon' slide with me
Woooahuuooh ooh ohh

[Verse 2: Joe Moses]
Before it was Nikki, I swear it was Tiffany
Held a nigga down, and kept it real when you visit me
You said you met a nigga but he nothing like me (What?)
Just let time fly by, and one day we'll be
Months flew by, and physically you left
The letters slowed up, and left a nigga by himself
Word on the street is that you're pregnant with a boy (WHAT?)
Colect calls blocked, broken hearts, what you told em'
Everything folding, Judge gave me fo'
Did my time like a man, just to let your ass know
I'm back on the grind, see I'm all changed
Word from the heart, I told you never not to change
But shit I'm still here, ride to the end
I won't call away when you need a helping hand
Here from the jump, tell me how to land
I'll never be your man, but I'll always be a friend
