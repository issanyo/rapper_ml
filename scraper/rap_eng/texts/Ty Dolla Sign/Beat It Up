[Intro: Chisanity]
I know what you want
I know what you need
Need a nigga that'll come fuck you
Suck you right, do it just like me

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I beat it up, beat it up, beat it once again
I give it up for big girls fresh out the pen
I treat the pussy so good man you'll wanna tell your friends
Man you'll wanna tell your friends
I'ma do you baby
Slobber all in your booty baby
Expect this home made baby
I scream like (?) baby
Pull your hair like (?)

[Chorus]
I'ma come through
I'ma beat it baby, beat it baby, beat it up
I'ma come through like a freak
Watch me beat it, beat it, beat it up

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I eat it up and you suck me up then I let you ride this dick
Then I get on top
Hit it all like (?)
You told your friends about it and these (?) on me too
She down for the threesome
With you she she act when we cum
She with it, all my bitches with it
Every time we get lit
(?)
Every joint I roll three grams
Real OG cost three bands
Real stoners rep T-God
RIP Aaliyah

[Chorus]
I'ma come through
I'ma beat it baby, beat it baby, beat it up
I'ma come through like a freak
Watch me beat it, beat it, beat it up

[Chorus]
I'ma come through
I'ma beat it baby, beat it baby, beat it up
I'ma come through like a freak
Watch me beat it, beat it, beat it up
