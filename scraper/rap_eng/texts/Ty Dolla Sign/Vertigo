[Verse 1]
Are we better off believing
What the ignorance suggests?
I wish living life was easy (Mhm)
But mine has been a mess
They say it comes with the seasons (Mhm)
But the seasons come and go (They go)
I go blurry when I'm thinking
Is it me or vertigo?

[Pre-Chorus]
Criticized, who am I to give up?
I’m breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up

[Chorus]
Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Or are we dreaming? (Darker days, brighter endings)
After the ride
Are you leaving? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I've been better off than broken
I’ve been battered, I've been beat
I wish I was more outspoken
But the words are out of reach
Hmm, thought I loved you in the moment
I was happy, I was young
I've been learning, I've been growing
But the worst is yet to come

[Pre-Chorus]
Criticized, who am I to give up? (Who am I?)
I'm breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up

[Chorus]
Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Or are we dreaming? (Darker days, brighter endings)
After the ride
Are you leaving? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Yeah


[Outro]
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I’ve been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I’ve been falling with my
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I’ve been falling with my (Vertigo)
Eyes closed, eyes closed (Vertigo)
I've been falling with my (Vertigo)
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been, I've been, I’ve been
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my
