[VERSE 1]
We just got out the club
And we drunk as fuck
We both horny, horny
Got my main bitch in my bed
So we can't go there
But we've got this backseat, backseat
I got this magnum in my pocket
Im getting head off in this cockpit
I got her screaming and hollering
I let her ride it while I'm watching

[HOOK]
While I watch that booty popping
Booty popping, booty popping, booty booty popping
While I watch that booty popping
Booty popping, booty popping, booty booty popping

[VERSE 2]
I got this drank in my cup, this kush going on
Now Im zoning, zoning
I put that pill on her tong, some smoke in her lungs
Now she's floating, floating
I got these bandz in my pocket
I throw em up like a rocket
Girl show me why you deserve it
Twerk, twerk
Show me why you deserve it
Twerk, twerk

[HOOK]
While I watch that booty popping
Booty popping, booty popping, booty booty popping
While I watch that booty popping
Booty popping, booty popping, booty booty popping

[BRIDGE]
We just got out the club
And we drunk as fuck
We both horny, horny

[HOOK]
While I watch that booty popping
Booty popping, booty popping, booty booty popping
While I watch that booty popping
Booty popping, booty popping, booty booty popping
