[Verse 2: 24hrs]
Woke up playin' Gucci Mane and Lucci
She been in my phone like, "Take this pussy"
Thinkin', "Should I hit?"
It's gon be lit, lit, lit
She was off the Henny and the Crown
After I hit, I passed her off
That ass was so soft
I wonder what it cost
"Twenty, you should meet my friend"
Next time, we should chill
Let's get it on
Lit, lit, have a threesome

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, yeah (pssh)
Whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, yeah (skrt)
I'm just out here thuggin' with my clique, yeah
Out here gettin' money with my clique, yeah (aye)
Lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, yeah (aye)
Whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, yeah (aye)
Out here gettin' money with my clique, yeah
I'm just out here thuggin' with my clique, yeah (aye)
