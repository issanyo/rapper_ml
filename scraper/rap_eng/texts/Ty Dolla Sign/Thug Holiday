[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh, yeah
Oh-na-na...
Dolla $ign!

[Chorus: Blac Youngsta + Ty Dolla $ign]
I know what you going through
We can have some fun, boo
I ain't got the sunroof
I'ma throw some ones too
Oh, yeah!
I know what you going through
I been through some shit too
The car ain't got no roof
I might throw some ones too
This is for my people in the ghetto, I'm calling out
All my thugs in the ghetto, I'm calling out

[Verse 1: Blac Youngsta]
I been in a gangster since I was born
I was young, dumb, and influenced
I don't fuck with niggas in my 'hood, I just ride past and beep my horn
Have you ever loved somebody and you thought they had your back?
Then they leave you for somebody, baby, how you do me like that?
How you gon' switch on me like that?
I know them niggas pussy cause I used to run with 'em
I might tell that lil' bitch pull up, and bring a ton with 'em

[Chorus: Blac Youngsta + Ty Dolla $ign]
I know what you going through
We can have some fun, boo
I ain't got the sunroof
I'ma throw some ones too
Oh, yeah!
I know what you going through
I been through some shit too
The car ain't got no roof
I might throw some ones too
This is for my people in the ghetto, I'm calling out
All my thugs in the ghetto, I'm calling out

[Verse 2: Blac Youngsta]
Can I touch your honey bun? (That's my bitch!)
Baby, can I fuck you with my gun? (She the shit!)
I might do a drive-by in that pussy
I'ma let my guys slide in that pussy
If I go broke, would you still love me?
If I go to jail, would you still love me?
If I go to Heaven, would you still love me?
If I go to Hell, would you still love me?
My lil' niggas love me so much, they'll kill for me
I love my bitch cause she was here for me, real shit
Would you love me in a Benz?
Would you love me on a bus?
I got 21 questions, and they all about us
I can see the pain in your eyes
Why your head down, baby? Lift it up

[Chorus: Blac Youngsta + Ty Dolla $ign]
I know what you going through
We can have some fun, boo
I ain't got the sunroof
I'ma throw some ones too
Oh, yeah!
I know what you going through
I been through some shit too
The car ain't got no roof
I might throw some ones too
This is for my people in the ghetto, I'm calling out
All my thugs in the ghetto, I'm calling out
