[Part 1]

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
You are all I need but sometimes, baby, I need more than that, mhm
Need more, mhm, said
You were all I ever wanted but sometimes I just want more
Give me more, more, it's more, I want you

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I was thinking maybe we could try something new
Hope you're with the same shit I'm into
I really think you'd like it
I'm talking 2 on 1, yeah, me and you on her
Let me show you something that you've never seen
Make you do a couple things that you never would believe
But I know that you gon' like it
Gotta keep it real, you know what I'm tryna say, girl

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
You are all I need but sometimes, baby, I need more than that, mhm
Need more, mhm, said
You were all I ever wanted but sometimes I just want more
Give me more, more, it's more, I want you

[Part 2]

[Verse 1: 6LACK]
Okay, I bounce in the club, so the hoes call me Rocky
Posted in the cut, and not looking for a blockhead
Yep, in my Gucci, I break a bitch back
And I keep a big bank, oh, I think they want 6LACK
Before I leave the house, get cozy head to toe
Invested in your life, but keep that on the low
Grinding on the pole and y'all wanna go, oh
You know your future brighter than a diamond ring, god damn
I put you on different things, god damn
You gon' make me break the bank, god damn
You know your future brighter than a diamond ring, god damn
I put you on different things, god damn
You gon' make me break the bank, god damn

[Outro: 6LACK]
You're all I ever need (God damn)
God damn (God damn)
You mean so much to me
