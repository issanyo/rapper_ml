[Chorus: TY$]
Now that I got your attention
I'mma show how ain't none of y'all hating on me
Say what you want did I mention I don't give a fuck?
I'm here and I'm never gon' leave

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Yeah 'bout to put my foot down, ain't nobody there when I look around
Now can you feel the movement? Sword in the stone tell 'em they can never move me
Bitch I'm here forever, never gon' leave, made it through the weather, close to my dreams
Getting warmer than a sweater, going for the kill, all these mannequins around gotta matter stand still
While you sitting back waiting I been working for this moment, music is the love and the money is the motive
It's a war outside and we lost a couple soldiers, pray that they and the sky helping look over my shoulders
Cause any day could be the day, but I'm all in better watch the cards that you play
All eyes on me and it's really getting heavy, 'bout to drop it on your head motherfucker hope you ready for it

[Chorus]
Now that I got your attention
I'mma show how ain't none of y'all hating on me
Say what you want did I mention I don't give a fuck
I'm here and I'm never gon' leave
Gon' leave, gon' leave, gon' leave
Never gon' leave, gon' leave, gon' leave
Never gon' leave, gon' leave, gon' leave
Never gon' leave, no never

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
So you can get used to my face I ain't going no where, finally seeing everything clear
Now my minds in focus somebody better hold me, hope that they don't let me go or it's over
If you on a team that's opposing I can see the signs but I will never stop for no one
Fuck that, I'm about to bust back, any motherfucker come and trespass tell 'em that I'm ready for 'em

[Chorus]
