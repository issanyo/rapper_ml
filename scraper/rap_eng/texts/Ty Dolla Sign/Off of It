Get up off, get up off your ass
If you like to move, if you like to move

And if I ever have to be a dad (damn)
At least you know I got the cash' (facts)
And you know I got the moves

Don't be difficult we're just friends
You don't risk-take you just chance
I ain't off with bread in advance
You want someone that got bands
I told her baby we can break (break)
Handshakes and new friends
Cause there's the break (dance)
Holy, holy Jesus Christ
Turn it up the DJ nice
Get up off that litchi white
Higher, higher
Turn down the lights baby pass me the lighter
When we in private you give me that icky, that icky
That sticky girl please do not bite it
You were just crossing my mind and I like it
