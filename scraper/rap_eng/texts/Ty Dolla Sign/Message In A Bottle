[Chorus]
Message in a bottle
Let me get a swallow
Fillin' up my cup
Section full of models
And we goin' up like it's a Tuesday
Drankin' 'til I'm woozy
Know I'm 'bout that action
It feel like a movie

[Verse 1]
Henny in my system
In here with the pistol
Middle finger to a hater
And any nigga with him
I just came to blow a couple bands
Hoes know I'm the man
Lil' baby on a Xan
Rollin' up a strain
'Bout to get high enough to make my ears pop
It's too strong for that Ziploc
They like, "You gon' get us kicked out"
Seen the huge stones in my wrist watch
Got 'em blowin' at me when I pass by
Starin' like she got a glass eye
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit
Coupe is outside, too drunk to drive
She said, "I got Uber, do you want a ride?"
Typed in my address, it led to some sex, now I'm dressed
Poppin' these Advils and textin' my ex, thanks to the...

[Chorus]
Message in a bottle
Let me get a swallow
Fillin' up my cup
Section full of models
And we goin' up like it's a Tuesday
Drankin' 'til I'm woozy
Know I'm 'bout that action
It feel like a movie

[Verse 2]
And I'm too drunk to drive, yeah
Share your location, girl, I'm tryna pull up
But I'm too drunk to drive, oh
Passive when it come to cannabis
But I'm blowin' like a curtain
My homie got some women at his crib
I know I'm finna flourish
Drankin' water, tryna save my liver
Walked in, seen some naked strippers
Couple homies started throwin' money
I just watch you like a babysitter, I'm lit
Stuck where I sit
Please don't mind me, girl, that's just how I get
Gave me a lapdance, I had plans to take down a lick
But something told me to FaceTime my ex
Must have been a message in a bottle
