[Verse 1: Price Tag]
I just be talking that, walking that, while I'm spitting at hoes
Smokin this, drinking, I'm probably gettin at hoes
Don Juli 1942, I'm sipping it slow
She take it all to the throat, you be kissing that ho
You got your own hair, own wheels, own crib, pay your own bills
You see some hating hoes you don't get along with
Well, turn it up cause this your song, bitch (gon fuck it up, up, up, up)
Stop, roll with it, a nigga move to LA but I'm straight out the toll with it
She tell you no but she hit my crib and knocked a hole with it
You talking over that internet and I'm at your door with it
Day one, we been balling, boy you been in a scrimmage
Pistol twerking, fuck that jerkin, boy, we been with the business
And in case you ain't know, my name Price, aka Mr. Take-your-life-or-your-wife
HS87 (BOW !)

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl, if you keep on doing what you do right now
We gonna go somewhere and I'm gonna take you down
And Imma smack that, girl, Imma smack that
And Imma smack that, girl, Imma smack that

[Verse 2: IAmSu!]
Look back at it like you tripped on it
Lil' momma got a nice set of lips on her
I said bend over, touch your toes
Don't bring no friends, I don't trust them hoes
Got a bad habit, I can't quit
My home girls always say that niggas ain't shit
I pull up in that bad, they be like ain't this
Young Suzy from the Rich always counting chips
I be like yeah that, yeah that, man
Flow crazy, fuck around and get a CAT scan
Young black man, whole lot of paper
I love kush, love kush, smoke it by the acre
Shake your money maker, for a money maker
I'm finna school these niggas, need a hundred majors
Everything ain't what it look, getting paper by the book
Go ahead, bring the hook in, huh

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl, if you keep on doing what you do right now
We gonna go somewhere and I'm gonna take you down
And Imma smack that, girl, Imma smack that
And Imma smack that, girl, Imma smack that

[Verse 3: Oktane]
It go money, drugs, bitches, liquor
My name, Oktane, I'm that, nigga
White girls love me, Iphone Insta
Gram going ham, got Becky and her sister
Going in like damn, who was that girl
I know she white but she shake it like a black girl
She bent it over put that dip in your back, girl
And then you shake it, let your home girl smack, girl
I got it all locked, the whole city, the whole state, whole country
Whole world, niggas gonna hate
Throw it at me, baby girl, go and pitch it
I'm at home plate, if you ain't walking towards my niggas wrong way
Keep it going, keep it shaking, baby, you know what I'm playing
If you shake it, I'm a smack it baby like the song saying
If your man try and trip tell him back off, nigga
It's Oktane, boy, I'm that nigga
TY go ahead


[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl, if you keep on doing what you do right now
We gonna go somewhere and I'm gonna take you down
And Imma smack that, girl, Imma smack that
And Imma smack that, girl, Imma smack that
