[Verse: Ty Dolla $ign]
Shake, shake, shake it like a salt shaker
She goin' hard like a jawbreaker
Dress fittin' on that body like wallpaper
I want it right now, not later
Left right, left right, girl get it, get it
Bring it right here, hey kitty, kitty
Stop playin' with it
The kitty good? I'm stayin' with it
One hunnid, yeah everything one hunnid
I got a pitbull, make the kitty run from it
Give it  that work
Playin' with the kitty and it ain't got fur, hm-mm, mm
Money long, my money long
You ain't worry bout it girl, you got your own
Yeah, i-independent
Drop it to the ground and get it, get it

[Hook:]
Drop that kitty down low
Pop that kitty down low
Shop that like a window
I'm gon' make you explode
Drop that kitty down low
Pop that kitty down low
Take that video phone
Drop that kitty down low

[Refrain:]
I know you want it all, I'm giving you a show
You like what I'm doin'? (Drop that kitty down low)
I know you want it all, I'm giving you a show
You like what I'm doin'? (Drop that kitty down low)
