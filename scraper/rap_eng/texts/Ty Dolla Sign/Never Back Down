[Intro: Oberyn Martell]
If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order
Tell your father I'm here
Tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts

[Hook]
Never stand down, never stand down, no, we never back down, no
Never stand down, no, we never back down, no, no, no, no
Killers on the front line, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And they're ready to go right now

[Verse 1]
Right now, no justice, no peace
All they got is love and loyalty
Yeah, we all been tough, yeah, we all been broke
Never say a word, yeah we [?]

[Refrain]
I'mma make up for my vengeance
Can't believe they took my sister
Never forget her, forgive her
All my guys ready for war
Cut up down with the sword
We the rulers of the dawn

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Still loyal to the throne, yeah we
We gon' do this on our own, yeah we
