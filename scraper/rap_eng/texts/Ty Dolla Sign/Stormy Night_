Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
It began after the storm inside
It began, it's just a haunted life (ahhh)
Oh my god, Ronny!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Woop, woop, woop
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Switch your, switch your attitude
Go 'head, level of yourself
This that different latitude (latitude)
Life too short, control yourself
Feel that feel, enjoy yourself

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, you owe it to yourself (woo!)
Girl, you owe it to yourself
Girl, you owe it to yourself
Girl, you owe it to yourself
Girl, you owe it to yourself

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
We began after the storm inside
It began, it's just a haunted life

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Ok, I'm turnt
At the party, fuck 'round, pussy boy, and you get burnt
Actin' up, you actin' buff, you fuck 'round, you get narc'd
Hang with your bitch, uh, I did it
Soft-ass, I'm with it, uh, I did it
Surgical snippet, uh, I did it, yuh, I did it, yuh, I did it
Niggas asking where I got my drip at
Told a nigga throw a backpack, nigga, back-back, mm
Asking for the money, where your racks at?
If you ain't my brother, told a fuck nigga "that's that"
Cartier, Cartier, throwing shade, uh
Asian bitch cleaning like the Crochet, uh
And my wrist nibble like the dark shade, uh
Came to the crib off a Kool-Aid, ayy!

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
It began after the storm inside
It began, it's just a haunted life

Breathing in, we absorb the light (ooh-ooh)
Breathing in, we see the morning light
