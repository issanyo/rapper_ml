[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Well since it's been a long time, been a long time
Yeah you know I don't mind, no I don't mind
Do I still blow your mind, still blow your mind?
Used to think about me all the time, 'bout me all the time (Oh)

[Verse: Quentin Miller]
I am so stuck in my ways
I am so stuck I won't change
I don't know how to forgive
All my enemies gotta pay
Finna get a check gotta stay up
Link when I pull up to your stay
Push start the whip, switch the lanes
Been a long time, been a long time

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Been a long time, been a long time
Yeah you know I don't mind, no I don't mind
Do I still blow your mind, still blow your mind?
Used to think about me all the time, 'bout me all the time
