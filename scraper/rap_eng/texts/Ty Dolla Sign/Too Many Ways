[Intro: Hit-Boy]
Yeah that that that
Yeah that that that
Yeah, uh huh
Yeah
Yeah that that that
Yeah that that that

[Chorus: Hit-Boy]
Housekeeper finding hundreds in my pants
I'm just getting head at the headquarters from a dime
Them hundreds turn to racks, then i tuck them in the stash
Too many ways to spend it, i just can't make up my mind

[Bridge: Hit-Boy]
Too many ways[x8]

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Too many ways to get too this paper
I, get too much love, can't fuck with you haters
I'm way too gone, man i'm activated
I, go at your head like an activator
I'm, Making statements like an activist
Real nigga sip champagne, i don't do actavis
I'm active on the catalyst for classic shit
You could get a bar and pay your shipping
Your handling, then hop up in this car
Tell me what's your favorite candle scent from yankee candle, bitch!
Throw yo' panties on the mantle, i dismantle it
Told you i'm the one, job done, i could handle it
Come sign up to my management, my flex game is extravagant
Come take a hit of the cannabis, it's so high you can't handle it
Going up we don't get away, but only for today
I gotta get back home

[Chorus: Hit-Boy]
Housekeeper finding hundreds in my pants
I'm just getting head at the headquarters from a dime
Them hundreds turn to racks, then i tuck them in the stash
Too many ways to spend it, i just can't make up my mind

[Bridge: Hit-Boy]
Too many ways[x10]

[Ty Dolla $ign]
I got letters coming home from the pen
Fuck the judge white, gave my lil brother life
Wonder why jocoso[?] had to go so early
Right before we really got to start living life
Now i swear there's too many ways to get rich
And i know too many ways to fuck yo' bitch
Too many ways to stunt
Too many ways to roll a joint, you can keep your blunt
Twos in the air keep your twos up, two throw away
This is for my little homie, cost him two hundred bucks
And i don't need no bodyguard i'd rather shoot
Dolla sign ballin

[Dom Kennedy]
House keeper finding hundreds in my pants
At the headquarters getting that head from a dime
Hundreds turn to racks, when you tuck em in the stash
There's so many ways to spend it i'll be buying what's on my mind
Too many ways Dom K gettin paid
Too many ways Hit-Boy gettin paid
Too many ways Dolla $ign gettin paid
Might see me in something different every time
I fuck with Hit boy that's a real nigga
I fuck with Dolla sign thats a real nigga
I fuck around and did it at the pool party, with two fine girls that look like sisters
I got airmax waiting on the weather to switch straight from amsterdam
Niggas ain't never did shit
Everybody know that i could go retarded
So let's do the staples and the garden
Housekeeper found a hundred in my pants tho
(yeah that that that)
White porsche on the freeway i make it dance like
(yeah that that that)
