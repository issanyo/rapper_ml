[Intro: Big TC]
Now anybody that [?] I don't make music just for you nigga
I make make music for the world nigga
So fuck, you like music, you’re a real musician
You just don't have just one kind of music
You have many
You know how to do everything

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been lied to?
Got drunk, got high too
Had sex on the first night
And it was just alright
You just wanna have fun
You just wanna wyle out
You just wanna stunt on your ex with your next
Like "Bitch, eat your, eat your heart out"
