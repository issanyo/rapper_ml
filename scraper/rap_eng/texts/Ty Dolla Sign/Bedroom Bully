-I told her ride the d**k
I'm a bedroom bully
Bedroom bully I said dem
Bedroom bully
Drop it, drop it, drop it
Pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it, drop it 2x
I take it you can see that I'm a player
Girl don't go no where keep that booty right there
Nose in the air
Like you don't care
Hand in the air
Like you on a rollercoaster
Girl come here
Drink that there
Tryna find a vibe time to put one in the air
Girl put that p***y up and sit it right here... Right here in this Dolla sign chair
You have to turn it up all the way up
She winding and dancing the same way she make love
She with it so I hit it
Yes I really beat it up
I wonder did I kill it
Cause she hasn't made a sound
Girl here I come just to take you down ooo
Women they don't never ever tell me no ooo
Because they know who I am and how it go ooo
The bedroom buly, bully til she kick me out
You have to tell her. -2x
Girl wine, wine, wine
While a n***a watch from behind, hind, hind
Girl your body straighter than a line, line, line
Back it, back it up rewind, wind, wind
Cause I'm, I'm, I'm on a mission to please
First you on your back
Now you on your knees
Grab my hand cuffs
I'm the ghetto police
I swear I'm on another level with this
Girl I'm bad to the bone
King ding a ling sitting high on my throne
Killing that p***y I'm a catch a case
Grab you by the waist
Then sit you on my(sit you on my)
Time to taste all ya (all ya)
Have your ass coming like i called you
Legs spread wide let me come bombard you
Dick so good I should charge you
3x
The end
