[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I used to stand by the mail til the cash came
Now I'm signing off checks with my last name
She understand my story, I never had game
Took one shot like Robert Horry to bring the city fame
House party nobody tripping cause we all paid
Once I cop the manshion we gon' pay the maids
Black Beamer top off down kings parade
They wanna take my top off like I'm JFK
I just brought the block to the VMA's
Free my niggas locked don't get to see the day
I got baby girl locked like she in some chains
Diamonds dancing around me like they Lisa Ray
I just still show love to the ones that hate
Talk down on my name that's just motivation
Your man is a bitch, I can't put my hands on 'em
I bet she hit the floor if I throw some bands on it

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Hundreds on hundreds I done blew up
Used to be the lil homie now I grew up
She said she want me and she need me but I'm too much
One thing about these hoes they show the crew love
Hundreds on hundreds I done blew up
Used to be the lil homie now I grew up
She said she want me and she need me but I'm too much
One thing about these hoes they show the crew love

[Post-Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Alright, alright
We gon' have a party at the house for the night
Alright, alright
We about to go all night, all night
Alright, alright
They already know, about to get the vibe right
Alright, alright
It's something in this liquor got me tripping, got me going all night

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Forty bands for the show, I'm bout to go up
Girl less talking, fuck texting, I told her pull up
Foot up on the gas speeding, I gotta slow up
Young boss they salute me, I'm like what up
That girl right there got some ass on her
If it was up to me I'd put a price tag on it
Them same ones I helped tried to go big on me
Plotting on a young nigga, you was my big homie
I ain't see you in a minute, hope you been winning
I ain't hating on nobody, I'm too busy living
This the same ones that get high with ya
She need a parachute to kick it, I'm a fly nigga
I'm tryna make ten millie in the same year
I don't see nobody and I can't hear
Don't make me tell my niggas go get 'em
His energy is kinda off, I ain't rocking with 'em

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Hundreds on hundreds I done blew up

One thing about these hoes they show the crew love
