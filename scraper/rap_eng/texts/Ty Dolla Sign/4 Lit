[Intro]
30, you a fool for this one

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Shit be two lit, shit be four lit
Pick me up before six
Gutter bitch with another bitch
We ain't trippin' 'cause we all hit
Yeah, we all with the fuck shit
Yeah, we all with the fuck shit
Two lit, shit be four lit
We ain't trippin' 'cause we all hit

[Verse 1: B.o.B.]
Yeah yeah, d—d—dat's the shit I like (Hey)
I ain't got no type, I can't decide
Girls like girls like girls, they can't deny
Eatin' pussy with a side of wine
No, it ain't no tellin' what we might do
When she in a penthouse with a tight view
Reefer got me stuck, shit, got my eyes glued
Oh yeah, that's my girl and that's our wife too

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Lit, shit be four lit
Pick me up before six
Gutter bitch with another bitch
We ain't trippin' 'cause we all hit
Yeah, we all with the fuck shit
Yeah, we all with the fuck shit
Two lit, shit be four lit
We ain't trippin' 'cause we all hit

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Ayy, Dolla hit it, B.o.B hit
Uh, T.I.P hit it, TZ hit

Uh, she know Dolla gettin' money now
Uh, I'ma pass her like Cam
Yay, I'ma pass her like Peyton
Ooh, I got diamonds on my neck
I got diamonds on my rib, put some diamonds on my main bitch
Uh, in the Porsche so wavy
Put a Rollie on my lady, Dolla need a new baby
Eh, she know Dolla stay litty
Still ain't heard about Dolla? You should come to my city

[Chorus: B.o.B & Ty Dolla $ign (T.I.)]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
You know we all wit' it
All my niggas quick to hit and never call bitches
Just might see my lil nigga pullin' up wit' y'all bitches
Pick the short ones up, bend it over tall bitch
Ayy, put that phone down and mind your fuckin' business, girl
Ayy, put some money up if you so independent, girl
Now I'm just tryna put some diamonds in ya pendant, get your titties fixed
Presidential suites and private jets, outside the city shit
One thing I can't stand is a petty hoeaux
Can't keep your business to yourself, don't go to telling folks
'Bout where you been and how much pussy you be sellin' folk
Don't wanna see her with a telescope, tell her tho'

[Chorus: B.o.B, Ty Dolla $ign& Both]

Two lit, shit be four lit (Yeeah)

Yeah yeah, Dolla $ign
