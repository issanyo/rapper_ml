[Verse: Ty Dolla $ign]
...
I put rings all on her and we not even married, ayy
I'm the reason everything she in to come from Paris, yeah
Paparazzi pictures, but we don't look embarrassed
From the boat to the terrace
Dick you down on the stairs, ayy
Did it all by myself
Dolla name ringing bells
Everything YSL
Ooh, yeah
Met her at La Marina
I make that pussy sing, yeah
Just might be my thing, ooh

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Champagne rocks, that's my thing (thing)
I like ice, that's my thing (thing)
That's yo wife, that's my thing (thing)
That's yo b, that's my thing (thing)
Champagne rocks, that's my thing (thing)
I like ice, that's my thing (thing)
That's yo wife, that's my thing (thing)
That's yo b, that's my thing (thing)
