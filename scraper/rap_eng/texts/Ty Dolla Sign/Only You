[Intro: Roy Woods & 24hrs]
Yea, yea
24 dollars
That's why I come to the woods one time
From 24, Dolla $ign one time, yea
No I don't know, I don't know
No I don't know, I don't know
What you doing for me, yeah, I don't know
No I don't know, I don't know

[Verse 1: Roy Woods]
I meet you down south from Miami
Living your life like you ain't got family
Shawty always bringing up something
Can't remember shit like I got alzheimer's
You ain't got that many problems
That's what gets me writing these songs
How did you got in your favor
Tell ya was it y'all tell you more
Even though I was fucking on her
You was always in my mind
But this time that I'm fucking little mami is for you to get on
But when I'm inside her, sometimes I gotta pull out (Sometimes I gotta pull out)
It was only you, only you I would love to feel raw

[Pre-Hook: Roy Woods]
It was only you, now I don't know
Who are these girls in my room, cause I don't know
If I ask you what to do, don't tell me "I don't know"
I wanted only you, now I don't know

[Hook: 24hrs]
Girl, it was only you
It was only you
It was only you
It was only you
It was only you
It was only you
It was only you
It was only you

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla Sign]
It was only you with me
You were the only one for me
Who gone love you better
Ride the D like you, freaky thing you do
Things with your tongue, got a boss nigga sprung
Let you drive the whip, take you on a trip
Saint Laurent my denim
I be going raw off in her
It was only you, it was only you
You said that pussy mine
I want it all the time
I see you every night
Promise you never lie
Don't ever cross that line
Girl, it was only you

[Pre-Hook: Roy Woods]
It was only you, now I don't know
Who are these girls is my room, cause I don't know
If I ask you what to do, don't tell me "I don't know"
I wanted only you, now I don't know

[Hook: 24hrs]
Girl it was only you
It was only you
It was only you
It was only you
It was only you
It was only you
It was only you
It was only you

[Verse 3: 24hrs]
Didn't we met in the worst way
She wanna fuck on the first date
Doing 120 on the highway
24hrs, know I get it my way
And it was only you
All the girls was a lie, it was only you
I won't play no game, let's just count my money
I let you count my money
I let you count my money
And you got a body like a Coke bottle
I like play house and I got four models
Bitch, I got cash on me, put your ass on me
You can go down on me, you can go arousing me
21 chasing a cheque, 20 smoke weed on a jet
Swimming shorts on cause the pussy too wet
Wanna fuck you and you, wanna fuck both of y'all
Do it at the same damn time
You won't tell nobody, y'all won't tell nobody
Y'all can be 20's girls
Huh, huh, huh
