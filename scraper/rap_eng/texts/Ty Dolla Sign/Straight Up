[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'ma tell you straight up
Do yourself a favor
Them feelings, don't catch those
Feelings don't catch those

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I don't really want much
I ain't with the drama
Save it for your man, girl
If it ain't money I don't wanna know

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'ma tell you straight up
Do yourself a favor
Them feelings, don't catch those
Feelings don't catch those

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Your man he a ball boy (damn)
Girl, why you still messin' with old boy? (I'm just saying)
He can't get you what you want
(I mean how that's working out though)
Say he be talking too much
And you know hoes gon' be hoes
And what you need is you a real one, a real one
Let you go out with your day one's
Without the holler and screaming
Just have you hollering, moaning
In the morning, wake your ass up so we can do it again
Let your grow, experiment
Don't judge, don't act like a bitch
You say that love ain't loved on that dude lately
I know that, that's the reason your nigga hate me
Since you got that real thing, that real thing
Girl don't start to feel things, like feelings, yeah

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'ma tell you straight up
Do yourself a favor
Them feelings, don't catch those
Feelings don't catch those

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl that thing so good, I done told you I love it, damn (aww damn)
Don't mind me, sometimes I get carried away, oh I
And that thing was so good I done said let's get married, damn
You can't blame me, we had that Jagged Edge playing

[Bridge: Jagged Edge]
Meet me at the bar in your white dress
In your white dress, in that dress
Meet me at the bar in your white dress
In your white dress, in that dress

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'ma tell you straight up
Do yourself a favor
Them feelings, don't catch those
Feelings don't catch those
