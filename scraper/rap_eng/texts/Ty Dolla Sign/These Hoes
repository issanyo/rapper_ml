[Intro]
These hoes (Dolla Sign!), be playing games for nothing
These hoes (Dolla Sign!), (Drug$) These hoes

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
You find that rubber in the trash can, (girl)
I said "When the fuck did you become the trash man?" (ah ah ah)
Girl, I never made you any promises
Never said that we would be  monogamous
Matter fact, what's up with the threesome?
You got all these bad bitches, won't you bring one?

[Hook]
These hoes, be playing games for nothing
These hoes, These hoes
Said these hoes, be playing games for nothing
These hoes, Oho...

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
You gon' accepted it or rejected it? (Girl, say yes or say no)
You fuck with me and you're the shit girl don't forget it, (oh yeah)
Hmm Yeah, your nigga was a basta
I beat that nigga up, you laugh him like it's nothing
And if I stop fucking with you, you probably try to set a nigga up...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Get'em Gates!
Dear Lord, I'm imported
Monogamy is monotony
Different forms of pornography in a new apartment
Photography starrin
Apologize to who? For once when you drivin a foreign
I was broke, I was boring
Out when the droppin martini
Chocolate designer my whip
Threesome with your partner here
Slap it, I buy, you adapt
Promise, I promess no better
Scream while I'm pullin yo hair
Playin games for nothing fuck
It make me XXX to care
Gates !
