[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla $ign
Drugs
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl I'm a put this thang on ya, oh yeah
Put this thang on ya, oh yeah
Put this thang on ya
Put this thang on ya, oh yeah
Put this thang on ya
I'm a put this thang on ya
Yeah, I put this thang on ya
Dollar $ign, young California
Big booty girls give me a boner
And no my car is not a loaner

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, I put this thang on ya
Everything fast, girl, like Daytona
All my tats sick, I be swole up
Fuck yeah, I'm a certified stoner
Pusha' Ink in this thang
Drugs gang, Taylor gang
And no you can't clone us
Connect it and please repeat all wrong bitch
Uh, I got a plug cross the border
I'm on the G6, giving orders
I had to put the whoop on it
You on that Whitney, I'll let you shoop on it

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Then I put this thang on ya, on ya
Put this thang on ya, I'm a put this thang on ya
Put this thang on ya, put this thang on ya
I'm a put this thang on ya
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl, I'm a put this thang on ya
Make your knees touch the shoulders
Put your back into it
Fuck it up to some Dolla $ign music
Yeah, my feet ten racks, girl
No drinks 'round me, get back, girl
I ain't a pimp, I am a mack, girl
And I'll shoot your nigga, I don't smack girls
They tryna to take our guns from us, oh, oh
I'd rather make 'em run from us, oh, oh
And have a gangsta party
You on that molly girl? I'm on that Bob Marley

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I still put this thang on ya, on ya
Put this thang on ya, I'm a put this thang on ya
Put this thang on ya, put this thang on ya
I'm a put this thing on ya
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah

[Refrain: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm a put this thang on ya
Girl, I pull up on it
And I slide up on it
Girl, I grind on it
I'm a ride up on it
Girl, I pull up on it
Real niggas shit maine
Oh, my girl like it when I put this thang on

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Put this thang on ya!
Put this thang on ya, I'm a put this thang on ya
Put this thang on ya, put this thang on ya

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla $ign, dolla'
