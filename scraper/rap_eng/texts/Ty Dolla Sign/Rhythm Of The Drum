[Hook: Akon]
I want to take you to my place so we can be alone
Cause I plan to beat beat beat beat beat like a caralluma drum
I wanna hear your melody while you sing out
And speak in tongues
Hold me tight while I beat beat beat beat beat
To the rhythm of the drum

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I been working all day so you know a nigga hungry
Girl I wanna lick the icing off the cake cake cake
Like your name was Rihanna
Yeah you got me on my bullshit
So you know a nigga horny
So baby let’s fake like we’re trying to make a
Baby blue jay and Beyonce
I don’t see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
First she drop the top like it’s summer time
Then I go deep like the bass line
And I’mma rock the boat work the middle
Change positions stroke it for you yeah
Yeah pleasure time to have sexy
Long time you had a rude boy I said

[Hook: Akon]
