[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Let me see you work it, baby
Gon' make it twirl around
Back it up right here, baby
Gon' make it now like
I'm fly, I'm one of the greatest
Wanna say my name, bitches getting naked
You see this cash, you gon' want to shake it
I'm from LA but it feels like we in Vegas
Shake your ass
Shake your ass

[Verse 1: Krizous & Ariaz]
The way I kick it, ain't been done in centuries
When you say west LA, you better mention me
Me and T, other niggas just ain't in the league
It fitting in, camouflage, army fatigue
We just some niggas with cheese
Top down, 100 miles, feeling the breeze
Homie roll up the trees cause I know that you got it
Tryna find my lighter but it's lost in all the cash in my pocket
That's how it goes down when you the man in yo
Man in yo, man in your town
Keep your eyes above water, stay afloat, don't drown
Keep your hands up 'til I say they can go down

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm fly, I'm one of the greatest
Wanna say my name, bitches getting naked
You see this cash, you gon' want to shake it
I'm from LA but it feels like we in Vegas
Shake your ass
Shake your ass

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Let me see you work it, baby
Gon' make it twirl around
Back it up right here, baby
Gon' make it now like
