When I wake up, I think of you
And I swear nobody else in the world has what we do
And I miss you, woo woo
And I miss you, woo woo

[Verse 1: Lil Chuckee]
When I get up, you're the first thing on my mind
Like a song in my head stuck on rewind
New bae tied to me like a shoelace
Get off work, you can ride me every kind of way
GPS, where you at? I need to track you
I need you now, look, ain't tryna harass you
Bad dude, friend said that I'm a bad dude
Smoke one with him, "Damn ain't know he was that cool"
Kiss you, sex you, all I wanna do
High school crush, yeah, we ain't even see a school
FaceTime, wait I need to see your face, I
Got damn you fine as fuck, bae I'm on my way now
And she ride for her nigga, killa
She be the hottest in the city, do what I say when I'm with her
I'll be back before you know it, trappin' out the bando
Know I bought it for her if you see her in that Lambo

[Verse 2: Lil Chuckee]
It's too many of y'all up in here
Trained to leave with me when I slip
I can't mess with no thot, I can call it on spot
My lil' dip waitin' on me at the crib, legs spot
Highway, flyin', goin' eastbound
Thinkin' of you in my dreams, in my sleep now
Don't ask her twice cause you know she down
Whatever you want girl, I hate to see frowns
Chuck you sprung, hungover, she the one
She done locked you down, you can't even have no fun
Yeah I know, dawg, young boy caked up
But she is who I think of just soon as I wake up
You just never know which one's gonna stay
The ones who gonna ride, not just lay up in the bed
[?] catch that bouquet
You gon' get that ring, girl believe me when I say

[Hook]

[Bridge: Lil Chuckee] x2
Girl you know I miss you
And I really wanna kiss you
And I wanna hold you tight
And I wanna give you monkey bites
