[Intro]
Woah, Young Jefe holmes

[Hook]
She look good with me
She gonna thug with me
She hold it down, take her to go meet the plug with me
Make her put that shit on then go hit the club with me
Think it's the hood in me, made her fall in love with me
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Glizzy you're a trap nigga, why the fuck you rap?
How much did you make today? Cause bitch I made a lot
Got some nat nats in the A and in the Chi I got some thots
If she ain't lil mama then she can't come to the spot
Esse I'm a boss, I'm a motherfuckin' boss
Shout out your favorite rapper, he's a motherfuckin' fraud
Lil mama used to stall now she like me cause I ball
Round of applause, got her clappin' for your boy
Dappered down, they know I'm the motherfuckin' coldest
I bought this bitch some Louboutin's, I barely even knew her
Got a four of red, I'm bout to pour up in a soda
Play with me your ass dead, you already know it

[Hook]
She look good with me
She gonna thug with me
She hold it down, take her to go meet the plug with me
Make her put that shit on then go hit the club with me
Think it's the hood in me, made her fall in love with me
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I just bought a (?) scrollin' through my (?)
Got a phone thug text from a bim
Got a phone call said my bitch cheatin'
Got a phone call said the homie snitchin'
Bitch get on my nervous, put her on detention
If you ain't got jump there, then you ain't official
Dolla $ign and Shy Glizzy realest in the city
If she ain't got an ass then she got some titties
I just stunt the mall and I spent a lot
I just hit the gate runnin' from the cops
Every time this beat drop she make that pussy pop
Got an (?) kitchen, water whippin' out the rock

[Hook]
She look good with me
She gonna thug with me
She hold it down, take her to go meet the plug with me
Make her put that shit on then go hit the club with me
