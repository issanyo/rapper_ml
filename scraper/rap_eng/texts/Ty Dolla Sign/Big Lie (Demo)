[Intro: Post Malone]
I know, I know
I know, I know
Mustard on that beat, ho

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Run it up, run it up
Count it up, count it up
'95 in my cup
Nicotine in my blood
Go, run it, run it
Count it, count it
Go, show me something, ayy, ayy
Go, talkin' that shit
Keep on barkin' lil' bitch
Bitches tryna get lit, ayy
Ros√© poppin' with the Balmain on me
And I keep on callin'
And they know that I don't answer my cell
No, I don't know your momma
I got so much commas
Girl, you know I'm only into myself

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
When I pull up, give this bitch my life
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
When I pull up, give this bitch live
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah, yeah
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you got that shit you don't got
Heard you say that shit a hundred times, yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you flexin', that's a big lie

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Run it up, run it up
Got my drank in my cup
Kiss some Louis in the rock
Breakin' bread with my dog
Gon' pipe up, pipe up
Light up, light up, get higher, higher
Gonna run up that bag
I'm gon' run up that Gucci, gon' run up that raft, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla bumpin' with the Saint Laurent on me
And they keep on callin' and they know that I don't answer my cell
Big boy flexin', big bands on the 'Gram
But I only spend it all on myself

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
When I pull up, give this bitch live
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah, yeah
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you got that shit you don't got
Heard you say that shit a hundred times, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Post Malone]
And I know who we are, yeah
And I know that we ballin'
When you wanna get this money
I don't want your bitch, just know it

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
When I pull up, give this bitch my life
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
When I pull up, give this bitch live
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah, yeah
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you got that shit you don't got
Heard you say that shit a hundred times, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Post Malone]
And I know who we are, yeah
And I know that we ballin'
When you wanna get this money
I don't want your bitch, just know it

[Outro: Post Malone]
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
