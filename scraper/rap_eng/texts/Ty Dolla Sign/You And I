[Verse 1: Juicy J]
You gon' leave here with me, it ain't no time to speak
You ain't no ordinary, ordinary closet freak
You look like Halle Berry with extra berry's
And I'm not too careful with having sex before you married
I'm about to kick your life to a fantasy, I been sharing with ya
Don't look away, it's only cameras baby, take a picture
Let me get you gone, this Ferrari is tricky
It's shatto butter on the dash, you tryna get trippy
I put my guard down, you put your cards down
Three of a kind, one thing on my mind, your panties stretched to the side
It's only mine, I'm about to break you off back to back to back
'Till you feel it in your rear, while your ass clap

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
You and I be fucking all the time baby
You and I be fucking all the time baby
You and I be fucking all the time baby
You and I be fucking all the time baby

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Girl you so damn fine, getting in trouble all the time
Windows down, my head in the clouds, your head went down
125 on 95, I cannot drive
I'm focused on you, you focused on me, look what we do
High speeding chases, let's get to vapours, can you roll a 7
Order more bottles with extra rose, went 6-11
Lil momma crazy, order 6 shots of that Grey Goose
Tryna chase baby I'm 100 proof
Now take this blue pill and relax
Let me lick the tats on your back
We about to go to war with your body in the set
Can you play with your fingers while I plan my attack

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
You and I be fucking all the time baby
You and I be fucking all the time baby
You and I be fucking all the time baby
You and I be fucking all the time baby

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
This one goes out to sexting and swimming pools
I pour 10 bottles of champagne in the water
It's a celebration, it's mutual baby
You make me do the unthinkable things, it's crazy
God damn little mama, I can make you a wife
Tonight, yeah this dick change your life
We get married in a Wraith, I turn your night to the date
Beat that pussy in London over Crème brûlée
What do you say? Can this teen take that princess away
I'm just a player, who need a reason to stay
Mm, mm, put your tits in the way
I'm ripping up my passport the way you fucked me today

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
You and you and I, you and I
