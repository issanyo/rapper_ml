[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
You always catch me roaming looking at your booty
Thinking about what I wanna do to ya
All of the things your man wanna do
Just stand there and poke it out and toot it
And just let me thug it out, oh, oh oh, ohh
When ya let me thug it out, oh, oh oh, ohh

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
You said you out at diners, that's cool you a star
Bottle service please no need for the bar
Dope boy stance how I lean on the car
Drinking straight out the bottle and no need for the straw
I'm talking you, you and all of yo friends
You got a future behind you and all these free bands
Mean this mothafucking party won't end, and let me get it like
She done seen the dolla signs
Busting it for the dolla signs
No resume girl you way too qualified
Let me figure out, magazine tryna catch a vibe
You say you ready for the world and you wanna be seen
To tell you the truth, I don't know what that mean, that's life
Getting to the money damn right
Probably left the city in the same night
Got another show bitch that's a red eye flight
That's when I know you and your niggas ain't right
I can have anything I like
These red and black Jordan's, one flight

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
You always catch me roaming looking at your booty
Thinking about what I wanna do to ya
All of the things your man wanna do
Just stand there and poke it out and toot it
And let me thug it out, oh, oh oh, ohh
When ya let me thug it out, oh, oh oh, ohh
