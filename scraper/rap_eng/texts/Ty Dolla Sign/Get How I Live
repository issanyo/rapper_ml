[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
He asleep right now, he off that drink, he ain't wakin up
She texts my phone, aye wut ya doin? Can I come over?
I texts back over
She on her way
These hoes ain't shit but I'm a fuck this bitch

[Chorus:]
'Cus I gotta get it how I live
She gotta get it how she live

[Bridge:]
And we get it til we get it right
Get it til we get it right
Get it til we get it right
Get it til we get it right
Gotta get it til we get it right
Get it til we get it right
Get it til we get it right
Get it til we get it right

[Verse 2:]
She fucked around and came up on some fuckin good dick
She from the valley but she act just like a hood bitch
I got her bent over
She prowl like a Range Rover
Pop the pussy like soda
Hit it slow like I pulled up

[Chorus:]
'Cus I gotta get it how I live
She gotta get it how she live

[Verse 3:]
I wish she could spend the night so I could hit it again in the morning
I think I'm falling in love with this girl again, again I'm zonin
She got a nigga, but I'm obviously bigger
I hope he don't catch her
'Cus he probably would kill er

[Chorus:]
I gotta get it how I live
She gotta get it how she live

And you know I got it

Get it til we get it right
Get it til we get it right
Get it til we get it right
Get it til we get it right
Get it til we get it right
Get it til we get it right
