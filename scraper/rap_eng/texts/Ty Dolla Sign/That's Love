[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
Girl you knock my drink right out my fucking hand
Give me attitude when I'm lapmed up with my friends
Girl you got that fire, see it in your eyes
But you always let me know you on my side
Girl I came home late last night, you was on my head
Tell me that I gotta get more than just the bread
You never let me skate, not even just an inch
But you’re always there every time I'm in a pinch

[Hook: Marc E. Bassy & Ty Dolla $ign]
Baby that’s love
Baby that’s love
Baby that’s love
Baby that’s love
You hold me down, I hold you down
Baby we fight, we never burn out
I stay around, long as you down
I know you know what I’m talking about
Baby that’s love
Baby that’s love

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Love must be the reason you never doubt me
Love must be the reason you ain't cheat when I went to the County
Love must be the reason why you still here patient
After I lied to your face, that's just cause I didn't want you to go
Love must be the reason ‘cause I know I don’t deserve ya
But our love strong, baby keep holdin’ on to each other
First time you let a nigga hit [?] ain't have on a rubber
Hell no nah girl I ain't never wearin’ one
You love my daughter, baby we can have my first son
I ain’t fuckin' 'round with you girl, one hundred
And if there’s ever a doubt in your mind
And you need to be reminded, put on this song
Girl this is your song
Remix so I put that dollar sign on

[Hook: Marc E. Bassy & Ty Dolla $ign]
Baby that’s love
Baby that’s love
Baby that’s love
Baby that’s love
You hold me down, I hold you down
Baby we fight, we never burn out
I stay around, long as you down
I know you know what I’m talking about
Baby that’s love
Baby that’s love
