[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Drank mixed with cranberry
Hoes in my Blackberry
Hoes in my iPhone
Hoes wherever I go
Drank mixed with cranberry (x4)

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Drank mixed with cranberry
Got a square bitch, she scary
I took her to my hood
Seen a pistol and got shook (you scared)
See the money, got sprung
Blood ain't thicker than cum
I'm fucking with my enemies sister
Bust all in her tummy
I ain't gonna brag about money
Most you niggas broke
I ain't gonna talk about bitches
You ain't got no hoes (x2)
I fuck your bitch without a condom
It was me, 3D and Krondon, sippin'

And now I'm leaning on your baby momma (x2)

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
I prefer the dome, being honest, baby girl at the honors
I street smart and she a college girl that stayed down when I was grindin'
Patron shots to the stomach, sprint race to the money
Come party with a real nigga right at my house, we clubbin'
Right at my house, we fucking, I play my Macbook then beat it from the back
Come back to it, I leave it where it's at, I fly to the city cause I need it where I'm at
I'm Westside with my name known, her chest out, she trained to go
Boy tried to snatch my main ho, nigga gotta try to match my bankroll like, "Whoa!"
I done seen a lot of girls in the city act brand new and turn model
Turn out, look on the internet, she was in a video doing porno
She go, no stop, shout out to the girls that like on top
For a young boy that made it from the bottom
We live one life, so I'm drinking out the bottle like, "Oh!"
