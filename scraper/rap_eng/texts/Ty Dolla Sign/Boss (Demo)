[Intro]
Hmm!

[Chorus]
Nothing to it, real one
Ain't nothing to it, boss
Nothing to it, real one
Nothing to it, I boss

[Verse 1]
I pay the cost, ooh, 'gon take it off? (take it off)
I record an' I ball, I ignored a lot of calls
You ain't talkin' about nothin', I ain't got no time
I got money on my mind
Ooh, I got real problems just like you
Tell that bitch, "I don't like you"

[Chorus]
Nothing to it, real one
Ain't nothing to it, boss
Nothing to it, real one
Nothing to it, I boss
Real one, boss
Oooh-oooh-oooh-ooh
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing to it, boss, I bought my mom a whip
Tell them hoes ain't doin' shit
Ridin' round with the top back
Don't be surprised when I ask you where the money at
Boss life, all this all mine
Ask me how I'm doin', man, I'm doin' fine
I be happy just to be alive
You ain't talkin' about nothing, I ain't got no time, facts
I was just tryna relax
Roll me up a join, I'm sippin' on yack

[Chorus]
Nothing to it, real one
Ain't nothing to it, boss
Nothing to it, real one
Nothing to it, I boss
Real one, boss
Oooh-oooh-oooh-ooh
Oh, yeah
