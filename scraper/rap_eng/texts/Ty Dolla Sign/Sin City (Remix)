[Intro]
Sin…
Sin City wasn't made for you
Angels like you
Sin City wasn't made for you
Angels like you
Oh you know [x16]
Right now

[Verse 1: PC]
Take that off
I just wanna see you
Your legs so soft
I had to be near you
Thoughts in mind, going so crazy
I just wanna hear you
One touch on your body, what I've prepared for you
Nothing will spare you
Pussy so wet, I feel the drip coming down
Must be in Houston
You close your eyes, you feel the rise, I go inside
I'm shooting

[Chorus]
Sin City wasn't made for you
Angels like you
Sin City wasn't made for you
Angels like you
Oh you know [x16]


[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
You a good girl, good girl, good girl, (GIRL!)
Too many weak bitches hating on you girl
Too many weak niggas playing with you girl
Stay gassin’, gassin’ you up
You wasn’t even looking for love
Till I told ya pull up
These niggas always tryna get over
You gave that man the cold shoulder
You said this place is so misogynistic
Can’t stand how broke niggas be treating women

[Chorus]
Sin City wasn't made for you
Angels like you
Sin City wasn't made for you
Angels like you
Oh you know [x16]
