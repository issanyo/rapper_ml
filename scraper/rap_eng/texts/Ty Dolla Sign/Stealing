Momma please don't judge me
Cause I'm a criminal
Mom I know you love me
Even though I'm a criminal, yeah

No, it's not subliminal
No, and it's not terminal
Oh, oh, oh, oh, it's emotional
Stealing all these bitches hearts

Oh I'm stealing all these bitches hearts
Yeah, I'm stealing all these bitches hearts
Oh, I'm stealing

Oh, if breaking hearts was a crime
I'd do double time
I'd be here just all solo
They'd put me under the cell
Never wish me well
I'd be here just all solo

[Outro]
Stealing all these bitches hearts
Just for, stealing all these bitches hearts
I've been stealing all these bitches hearts
Oh, I've been stealing
