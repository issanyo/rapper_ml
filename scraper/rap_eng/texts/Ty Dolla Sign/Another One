[Hook: Ty$]
One bitch fucked up, I'mma go and get another one
Those lips ain't shit, I'mma go and get a better one

[Verse 1: Ty$]
Pussy come a dime a dozen, so I got a dozen dimes (yeah)
I got my own kush in named T-Y dollar sign, (oh yeah)
I got a bad bitch in here that'll touch her toes and push it wide (oh yeah)
I got a bad senorita that I’m just fucking on the side, (oh yeah)
I ain’t the pimp but you know I’m getting money out these hoes
You'd be surprised what your main bitch do behind closed doors

[Bridge]
Well could this be, that groupie love?
She say she love me, I'm no dummy, all she want is dick and money
Could this be, that groupie love?
She say she love me, I'm no dummy, all she want is dick and money
Could this-

[Hook: Ty$)
One bitch fucked up, I'mma go and get another one
Those lips ain't shit, I'mma go and get a better one

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
I said I'm thinking 'bout my main girl
Man I know she proud of me
Girl I always fuck with you
But you just wasn't down for me
Now I'm with them bad hoes
Make her touch the ground for me
Me and Ty Dolla' Sign, (that bitch might blow a pound with me)
We down town, high rise, fat ass
Fi-five, kil the cat cat; nine lives, bow, bow (bow, bow)
We drunk, drunk - you playin' with it
Ten G's, I'm stayin' with it
My Gold Card, I'm payin' with it
Real nigga you layin' with it
My hat fitted, my tracks hidden
Good weed, your tracks hidden
Hit it once, she act different
Tell the homie you back flippin'
West side, we act different
New Benz with the tag missin'
When you're with him, you're falling off
When you're with me, your ass thicker (ah)

[Bridge: Dom Kennedy]
That groupie love
She say she love me, I'm no dummy, all she want is dick and money
Could this be, that groupie love?
She say she love me, I'm no dummy, all she want is dick and money

[Hook: Ty$)
One bitch fucked up, I'mma go and get another one

[Verse 3: T. Mills]
Scoop a new bitch every day, like a bus driver
DM your ex, she a rough riderr
Don't do the locks, it's pimpin' bruh'
I just hit it like a homer, no Simpson bruh' (yeah)
I tell Tiny to kick it with his white friends
I'm in a white Benz, getting high 'till the night ends
Took the white gin, with two white twins and one light skin
I told her; you would too, if you knew, what this game would do to you
Up in that pussy since half past two, been up in that pussy since half past two
That groupie love
She say she love me, I'm no dummy, all she want is dick and money
Could this be, that groupie love?
She say she love me, I'm no dummy, all she want is dick and money

[Hook: Ty$)
