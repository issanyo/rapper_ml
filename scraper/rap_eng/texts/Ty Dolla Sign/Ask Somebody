[Intro]
Yeah yeah, better ask somebody
Here we go now, louder
Here we go now, come on

[Verse 1: Consequence]
Burn one with me then pass it to the homie
What I got on the passenger side could pass for Naomi
I could pass for Kobe when it comes to the stacks
Too many classes homie when it comes to the raps
It's in my soul to trap, not Bryson Tiller though
And I don't lighten up like Michael case of vitiligo
And I don't slut shame her when I get to go
I just get, get, get it then I give her dough
For sure my band members been getting bands
We drunk with power, yeah we the drinking champs
I promise this, yeah I'ma make a dance
For all of you cowards
That'll run into a man and do the running man challenge
Cause you was running your mouth about a fake account balance
Why be on that when there's freaks in the lobby?
Summer 16, you better ask somebody

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I had a bunch of bad bitches at my after party
Little bitch, you better ask somebody
You better ask somebody
You better ask somebody
I had a bunch of bad bitches at my after party
Little bitch, you better ask somebody
You better ask somebody
You better ask somebody

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
(Ain't no unit like the one I got, it's G-Unit)
I keep you fresher than the next bitch, indeed
In them new Birkin bags and Brazilian weaves
Got the keys to the (?), big body B's
Smile for me baby, I got what you need
In the Maybach Benz for us to ride
At the top of the stash nigga, we don't side
Nigga we outside and we rep south side
South Jamaica Queens thing
Two for 5 fiend thing
Balmain Jean thing
Leathers on the Jordans that you seen on the dream team
Triple beam thing
Boss like Springstein, AR-15
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Six bought a Rollie now it's back to Queens

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I had a bunch of bad bitches at my after party
Little bitch, you better ask somebody
You better ask somebody
You better ask somebody
I had a bunch of bad bitches at my after party
Little bitch, you better ask somebody
You better ask somebody
You better ask somebody

[Outro]
Oh
God damn
Louder
God damn
