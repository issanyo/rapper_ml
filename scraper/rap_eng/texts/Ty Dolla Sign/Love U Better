[Intro]
...head, all night long
You wanted me to love
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: The-Dream & Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl you should know that I can love you
Better than he can
Girl you should know that I can love you
Better than he can

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Pull up on your girl with my roof gone
I'ma pull up on your girl with my jewels on
Pull up on your girl with that heat on
And she ain't know if it's a Dolla or a Dream song
First I beat it from the back, she on top now
She used to wanna leave, but she not now
She used to wanna be with you, but nigga, not now
It's kinda funny how she put herself on lockdown
And now you talkin' that blah-blah-blah
I'm up here bonin' that la-la-la
Gave it to her, made her scream, "Da-da-da"
And now you wanna act all rah-rah-rah rah-rah-rah

[Chorus: The-Dream & Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl you should know that I can love you
Better than he can
Girl you should know that I can love you
Better than he can

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Girl, you should know that
I'ma fall asleep in it, popped a whole Xan
If you gettin' cold feet, I'll make the snow sand
I'ma rest in peace in it, pop a toe tag
Pull up on her in an Uber, that's how I maneuver
Turn this D into a B+ and I'm her tutor
Turn a B into a D cup, hallelujah
Got her clappin', yeah she booby-trappin' out at Hooter's
Treat the little lollipop like Lollapalooza
I'm the one to introduce her, kama to sutra
Say she a cougar when it comes to Young Mula
12 gauge, girl, Tunechi 'bout to one-two ya

[Chorus: The-Dream & Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl you should know that I can love you
Better than he can
Girl you should know that I can love you
Better than he can

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh, ooh, yeah
Oh, oh
No, he can't love you
Oh, he can't love you, love you, love you like I do
Oh, no he can't love you

[Chorus: The-Dream & Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl you should know that I can love you
Better than he can
Girl you should know that I can love you
Better than he can
