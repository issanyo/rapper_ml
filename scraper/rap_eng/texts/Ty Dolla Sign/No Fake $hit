[Intro]
I'm done with the bullshit right now
I want to be, all I want

[Verse]
If it's alright, I'll come see you after the studio, girl
Yeah, I said I'd come through right after the club
Bae, I've been working real hard and I don't see why you can't understand
I ain't like these lil' niggas you've been fucking with, baby, I'm a grown man
Baby, trust me, baby, trust me, I know I done let you down
Yo, time and time in this life, girl, there's gonna be ups and downs
Don't you know who gonna be there for you, girl, when ain't no one else around
Me, it's me bae, Me babe

[Hook]
And all I want from you right now is forever
We don't do no fake shit around here
We don't do no fake shit around here
All I want from you right now is forever
We don't do no fake shit around here
We don't do no fake shit around here
No
