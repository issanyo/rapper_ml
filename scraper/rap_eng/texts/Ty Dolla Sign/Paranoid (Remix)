[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla $ign, ya know he here right
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I see two of my bitches in the club
And I know they know about each other
I think these bitches tryna set me up
Maybe I’m just paranoid and this is the remix

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I got a bad light skin from Cali
She be in the club with all baddies
Little mama used to be my main bitch
But now we don’t speak the same language
I love my bitch, I could bang it
But my dark skin bitch know how to take dick, yeah
She said she wear those red bottoms all night
You never heard of Dolla $ign, bet you know now
Both of my bitches drive Range Rovers
None of my bitches eat leftovers
Both of my bitches look good as fuck, yeah
Your bitch look like booga wolf

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I see two of my bitches in the club
And I know they know about each other
I think these bitches tryna set me up
Maybe I’m just paranoid
Yeah, I’m paranoid, I’m trippin'
I’ve been smokin', I’ve been sippin'
I’m fuckin' around with two bitches
But I never made them hoes my misses

[Verse 2: Trey Songz & DJ Mustard]
Trigga, got bad Spanish bitches in Miami
Shit, all the bitches Spanish in Miami
Get pussy like I am me
Hatin' ass niggas can’t stand me
Flown cross country out to Cali
Work it out like Bally's
Introduce the hoes to my homies
Titties feelin' all silicone-y
All of my bitches play sleepover (What you say Trey? What you say)
And then we fuck, and then we buss and do the sheets over
And then we fuck and then we fuck and then we buss
None of my bitches wanna fuck with you, fuck with you fuck with you
All of my bitches eat pussy too, yes they do

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I see two of my bitches in the club
And I know they know about each other
I think these bitches tryna set me up
Maybe I’m just paranoid
Yeah, I’m paranoid, I’m trippin'
I’ve been smokin', I’ve been sippin'
I’m fuckin' around with two bitches
But I never made them hoes my misses

[Verse 3: French Montana]
If I give a fuck about a bitch, I’ll always be broke
I’d never have no motherfuckin' endo to smoke
I get in with tooty, niggas actin; looney
Do you, let your girl do me
Now I got a bitch out in Oakland, got a bitch in the A
Got a bitch out in Portland, got a bitch in the Bay
Got a bitch out in Queens, got a bitch in the Valley
I be reppin' the East, while I’m smokin' in Cali
Man this shit head gettin' risky
Feelin' like $hort with bitches
Paranoid, rolla toya
Now I’m ballin' like A.I on the Hoyas
Bitches moist, high gettin' bent
Bitches gettin' paranoid bet it be the hen, yet again
I be pimpin' like Hugh Hef'
Seen two of my bitches two step

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I see two of my bitches in the club
And I know they know about each other
I think these bitches tryna set me up
Maybe I’m just paranoid

[Outro: DJ Mustard]
Now this is what I want y'all to do, hands up, hands up
Hands up, hands up
If you came to fucking party hands up, hands up, hands up
If you came to fucking party hands up
Now just rock, just rock, if you came to fucking party just rock
Just rock, just rock and this is the remix
