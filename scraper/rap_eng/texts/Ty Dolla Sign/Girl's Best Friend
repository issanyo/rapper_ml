[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Just so you know Dwayne Carter, that my best man
I ain't playing, so no switching to the next plan

I'm a grown man, I ain't gotta beep it out
Say you gotta new watch, lemme peep it out
Yah, new Chanel
And I'm known to floss like a root canal
And I live the boss life, you can tell
Bracelet on frostbite, heavy metal
I ain't giving up, no way
I'm too good if you ain't got me ranked
I'm too good, I'm beyond outer space
I'm too good to be in line at the bank
