[Intro: SoMo]
Whoah whoah whoah yeah
Whoah whoah whoah yeah
Whoah whoah whoah yeah

[Verse 1: SoMo]
Take off those heels, lay on my bed
Whisper dirty secrets while I'm pulling on your hair
Poison in our veins, but we don't even care
Candles dripping on your body, baby this ain't truth or dare
Everybody wonders where we've run off to
My body on your body, baby sticking like some glue
Naughty, let's get naughty, girl it's only one or two
The fever's fucking running, feel the heat between us two!

[Chorus: SoMo]
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride, I'm, I'm gon' ride on you baby
On you lady, all night, all, all night!
I'm gon' take care of your body
I'll be gentle, don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer
Feel your chest on top of me
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride, I'm, I'm gon' ride on you baby
On you lady, all night, all night!
I'm gon' make you feel that loving
Getting weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip-top
All the way down to your feet!

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm gon' ride on you baby
Pull up on you in that Telsa
Girl you said you got a man
But he broke so why he there for
He ain't doin' what he supposed to
He don't treat you like a woman
He ain't there when you need him
All you got is your home girls
You let me ride on it
That pussy so good
Wanna make you my woman
Shit
Make me never wanna leave ya alone
Just lay back and put your feet up

[Chorus: SoMo]
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride, I'm, I'm gon' ride on you baby
On you lady, all night, all, all night!
I'm gon' take care of your body
I'll be gentle, don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer
Feel your chest on top of me
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride, I'm, I'm gon' ride on you baby
On you lady, all night, all night!
I'm gon' make you feel that loving
Getting weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip-top
All the way down to your feet!

[Verse 3: K Camp]
Me and lil momma on the same path
Me plus you better do the math
She playing with a heart that she can't have (whoop)
I'm playing in the water like a bird bath
You know it all started with the friendship
I ain't trying to gas ya up like a quick trip
But the way that you walk and those lips
Make a nigga wanna spend that grip
She know when I bring her close, I'm about to do the most
I'mma dick your ass down, I ain't even got to boast
Leave your ass shock like you just seen a ghost
Party in the pussy and I'm acting like the host
Got that right
You can have it if you act right
Said she left her old nigga he ain't act right
From the back then I turn her on other side
Now baby girl let ride

[Chorus: SoMo]
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride, I'm, I'm gon' ride on you baby
On you lady, all night, all, all night!
I'm gon' take care of your body
I'll be gentle, don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer
Feel your chest on top of me
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride, I'm, I'm gon' ride on you baby
On you lady, all night, all night!
I'm gon' make you feel that loving
Getting weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip-top
All the way down to your feet!
