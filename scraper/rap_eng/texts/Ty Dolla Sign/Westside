[Chorus]
The Westside, girls all extra fine
The Southside, they thick like apple pie
The East coast, the girls all down to ride
But I rep the Westside
You know I love the, the Westside, Westside
You know I, I've been all around the world I still love the Westside
Palm Trees and them pretty girls
You know I love the Westside
Throwing up them gang signs
And the movie stars shine, Westside
You know we stay out all the time
That's why I love the Westside

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'm from the Westside
Fuck them niggas, fuck them niggas from the other side
I got a bad lil bitch, just like Left Eye
I got a foreign but I still like to low ride
I used to listen to that Chronic now I'm blowing Kush
Steph Curry on them hoes
I just scored a swoosh
I rep the gang, gang, gang, get it understood
This one for the homies from my neighbourhood

[Chorus]
The Westside, girls all extra fine
The Southside, they thick like apple pie
The East coast, the girls all down to ride
But I rep the Westside
You know I love the, the Westside, Westside
You know I, I've been all around the world I still love the Westside
Palm trees and them pretty girls
You know I love the Westside
Throwing up them gang signs
And the movie stars shine, Westside
You know we stay out all the time
That's why I love the Westside

[Verse 2]
Where they throw them B's and C's up
I wake up, count my money then I roll some weed up
I chuck a whole hundred pack
I had to re-up
I got that work, I got that work, I fuck the streets up
Top down in the summer
Broke nigga can't; rich nigga do what he wanna
I'm from Southern California
Hit the weed man and fuck up some commas
Yeah

[Chorus]
The Westside, girls all extra fine
The Southside, they thick like apple pie
The East coast, the girls all down to ride
But I rep the Westside
You know I love the, the Westside, Westside

[Verse 3]
Might be from out of town but she know how I get down
Told her she should stick around and help me blow a whole pound
It's too litty on the Westside
Make your pocket biggie on the Westside
Good pussy on the Westside
You already know what the best side, yeah

[Chorus]
The Westside, girls all extra fine
The Southside, they thick like apple pie
The East coast, the girls all down to ride
But I rep the Westside
You know I love the, the Westside, Westside
You know I, I've been all around the world, I still love the Westside
Palm trees and them pretty girls
You know I love the Westside
Throwing up them gang signs
And the movie stars shine, Westside
You know we stay out all the time
That's why I love the Westside
