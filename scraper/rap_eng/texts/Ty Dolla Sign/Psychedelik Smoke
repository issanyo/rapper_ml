[Intro: Future]
What are those arts?
Chiefin' on some good herb
Esco fired up

[Chorus: Future]
Psychedelic flow, smokin' kush by the pound
Got some girls in my condo, I'ma pimp 'em if they down
Broke ass niggas wit' some high-class swagger
I would come to where you at, but I'm on another level
Psychedelic flow, roll some kush, let's get high
Let the weed take your spirit over and relax your mind
Champagne bubble bath, hope I don't drown
Let me inhale the smoke, now my head in the clouds

[Verse 1: Future]
Roll up then get some papers
Then roll me up some reefer
I'm stimulatin' my mind
Gon' fire me up some diesel
I treat it like it's legal
Get higher than a eagle
I'm lit up in the crib; me and some mamacitas
We live a life of luxury and everything beneath us
They treat us like some criminals and never thought we'd be here
They can't even compare niggas like me, I'm out in Egypt
My nigga just went up for appeal, he want his freedom
It's like George Clint', P-Funk era, we just on syrup
I keep pourin' Actavis codeine, my drink is thorough
I'm a rockstar rapper type nigga, I'm just on steroids
I got pretty New York City bitches, I'm like they A-Rod

[Chorus: Future]
Psychedelic flow, smokin' kush by the pound
Got some girls in my condo, I'ma pimp 'em if they down
Broke ass niggas wit' some high-class swagger
I would come to where you at, but I'm on another level
Psychedelic flow, roll some kush, let's get high
Let the weed take your spirit over and relax your mind
Champagne bubble bath, hope I don't drown
Let me inhale the smoke, now my head in the clouds

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Psychedelic kush, that's that Louie 13
Got some niggas out in New York, send them 20 pounds a week
I be stayin' medicated, every day I'm meditated
If I'm movin' too slow, bitch, that probably mean I'm probably faded
Been around them drugs, but I just stick to marijuana
Niggas get to actin' up, we hit 'em wit' the llama
Had me open up, but all these bitches came for Dolla
Niggas tried to sound like me, but they can't fuck with Dolla
And you know I'm reppin' Taylor
Homies twistin' Backwoods, but you know I fuck with papers
I just came from Jungle Boys, the blessed me with the flavors
I would come to where you at, but, lil' bitch, I'm too major

[Chorus: Future]
Psychedelic flow, smokin' kush by the pound
Got some girls in my condo, I'ma pimp 'em if they down
Broke ass niggas wit' some high-class swagger
I would come to where you at, but I'm on another level
Psychedelic flow, roll some kush, let's get high
Let the weed take your spirit over and relax your mind
Champagne bubble bath, hope I don't drown
Let me inhale the smoke, now my head in the clouds
