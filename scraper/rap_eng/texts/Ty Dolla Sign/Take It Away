[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
We just landed in your city, finna set up shop
Water drippin' off the whoadie, we just let them watch
Dirty vans, pants up and over Polo socks
Off a Jay round the way, finna set up shop
We the wave in the city now we taking off (taking off)
What it take to make it over, we just work a lot (yeah)
Saw the way we put it in make her drop her jaw (yeah)
I'm like oh my god, oh my god, oh my god

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
She like "wait a minute what you told me?"
You were talking to a version of the old me
Now you're talking to a version of the cold me
Off of something while these strangers get to know me

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Take it away, let it go
Let me know, sip that muddy, take it slow
Take it away, keep it going
Let me smoke on something strong and find my zone
Take it away (skrrr)
Take it away, take it away
Take it away, take it away
Take it away, take it away

[Verse 2: TK Kraviz]
Take it away, take it away
Landed in your city 'bout to set up shop (wooh)
I just got two bad things to lip lock (mwah)
I can tell they hating but they won't stop (oh)
You can tell 'em I'ma give it all I got (yeah)
Take all that hate, by the way, we going up (up)
Don't show no love (love), I'm feeling numb (hey)
And my bank account flooded like my wrist though, aye
Living life on the edge takin' risks though

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
She like "wait a minute what you told me?"
You were talking to a version of the old me
Now you're talking to a version of the cold me
Off of something while these strangers get to know me

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Take it away, let it go
Let me know, sip that muddy, take it slow
Take it away, keep it going
Let me smoke on something strong and find my zone
Take it away (skrrr)
Take it away, take it away
Take it away, take it away
Take it away, take it away

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Woooh!
She like "wait a minute what you told me?"
You were talking to a version of the old me
Now you're talking to a version of the cold me
Off of something while these strangers get to know me

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Take it away, take it away
Take it away (skrrr)
Take it away, take it away
Take it away, take it away
Take it away, take it away
