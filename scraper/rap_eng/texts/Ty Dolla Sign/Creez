(Intro)
I’m goin…
I’m goin…
Yea

(Verse)
Dub full of kush, cup of drink
Hoes in the lobby, they wanna party
My ex girl in here, she say come here
Act like i didn't hear
There's some hoes up in here
LA girls, all of em bad
She say she got a man but she do it for the bands
She say sexual harassment, I started laughing
No, how I know you ratchet
In the club with yo glasses

(Pre-Chorus)
Let me squeeze on that booty like a ruger
We need no body guard girl, Im a shoota
I took his main bitch just like king Koopa
I told her move bitch get out the way like Luda

(Chorus)
I put my creez on er
I walked in and put my creez on er
Yeeeaaahhh
I put it on er, put it on er, put in on er
Put it on er, put it on er, put in on er
Put it on er, put it on er, put in on er
Put it on er, put it on er, put in on er

(Verse)
What you' gonna do without that D?
I'll give you all that O
How you gon act with all this creez?
What you call that ho?
Tell yo' main girl, better fall back though
She wanna get hit like contact sport
Pull up to the scene in a all black ghost
It’s the type of night that you come back fo
She know what she doin, she stretchin right
She don’t use parental discretion like
I’m gonna squeeze on that booty forever
‘Cus forever is usually better
But forever is usually never
‘Cus I ain’t fuckin with that bitch
She says she got a man but that really don’t mean shit

(Pre-Chorus)
Let me squeeze on that booty like a ruger
We need no body guard girl, Im a shoota
I took his main bitch just like king Koopa
I told er move bitch get out the way like luda

(Chorus)
I put my creez on er
I walked in and put my creez on er
Yeeeaaahhh
I put it on er, put it on er, put in on er
Put it on er, put it on er, put in on er
Put it on er, put it on er, put in on er
Put it on er, put it on er, put in on er

(Verse)
They say you don’t know what you got un… til it’s gone
Take yo main chick and make her my side dish like corn
Check my rap sheet
Pussy, assault, and battery's all I know
That headboard go bang bang
Pull up and let them shots go
Squeeze on it
If I hit er with that D I put them Z’s on er
God bless yo body like I sneeze on it
Everything just my type
Ain’t tryna recycle no lines but don’t waste no mo time

(Pre-Chorus)
Let me squeeze on that booty like a ruger
We need no body guard girl, Im a shoota
I took his main bitch just like king Koopa
I told er move bitch get out the way like luda

(Chorus)
I put my creez on er
I walked in and put my creez on er
Yeeeaaahhh
I put it on er, put it on er, put in on er
Put it on er, put it on er, put in on er
Put it on er, put it on er, put in on er
Put it on er, put it on er, put in on er
