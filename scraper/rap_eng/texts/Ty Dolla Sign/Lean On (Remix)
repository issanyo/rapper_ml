[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
The purple be coming in, the purple be coming in
My white girl got me turnt up off the Jameson
The percocet kicking in, the xan just with ten
I don't know how I'm getting home from this bitch
Damn I prolly shouldn't have drove to this bitch
Fuck it, I'll just go home with this bitch
Or this bitch, or this bitch, or this bitch
You ain't getting money, then don't say shit
I got a white Porsche on Forgiatos
Smell the kush and they gon' follow
We be gettin' lit, gettin' lit
She say "can you feel your face?", no, I can't feel shit
Na na na, on my mama
Need somebody to lean on
Lean on

[Verse 2: MØ]
What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over

[Pre-Chorus: MØ]
But the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

[Chorus: MØ]
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
