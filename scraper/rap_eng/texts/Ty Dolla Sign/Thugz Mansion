[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla $ign
My nigga Mozzy, won't you help me out?

[Verse 1: Mozzy]
Gangland, I’m in love with the dealin'
Barely clingin' to life as he suffer severely
Either love me or fear me, you gotta feel me
I don’t want a pass from loafin', you better kill me
You don't get a pass if you lackin', you niggas hear me?
Catch him in McDonald's, it's brackin', you niggas hear me?
Ayy we sincerely devoted if you ain't notice
Fifty ball shoved in the denim, them bitches bloated
You got respect for the struggle if you’ve been homeless
Now I’m in the foreign, it's factory clear-coated
Ayy, where the mansion for thugs? I’m tryna slither
Gotta be a fella to enter, just real niggas

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh, ain't no place I'd rather be (Rather be, oh whoa)
Did it all for the family (Oh oh)
Sky-high, iced out paradise (Way, way up in the sky)
In the sky (Whoa, yeah)
Ain't no place I’d rather be (Rather be, oh whoa)
With the bros right next to me (Oh oh)
Chromed out mansion in paradise
In the sky (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: YG]
Ayy, ayy free the homies, if I could, I would
A bag for the lawyers, he can tell the judge they should
Break down the case 'cause it ain't happened like that
This the shit you gotta go through when you young and you black
You in the hood 'cause your family, they ain't have it like that
With a gang full of bangers, they was havin' your back, ayy
Pass the straps, bust 'em, passin' them back, ayy
Was niggas really your friend? You had facts
Now you gone and your bitch ain't showin' up
She let a nigga fuck and your daughter, she growin' up
This verse for my niggas locked up, I'm with you
Bunkin' with niggas, no pussy, stressed out, I feel you

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh, ain't no place I'd rather be (Rather be, oh whoa)
Did it all for the family (Oh oh)
Sky-high, iced out paradise (Way, way up in the sky)
In the sky (Whoa, yeah)
Ain't no place I'd rather be (Rather be, oh whoa)
With the bros right next to me (Oh oh)
Chromed out mansion in Paradise
In the sky (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
(Whoa)
I swear it ain't no place I'd rather be
(Whoa)
Without you, where would I be? Where would I be at?
(Whoa)
Ups and downs for real ones, but we will never fold
(Whoa)
'Cause one day everybody's gotta go

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh, ain't no place I'd rather be (Oh whoa)
Did it all for the family (Oh oh)
Sky-high, iced out paradise
In the sky (Whoa, yeah)
Ain't no place I'd rather be (Oh whoa)
With the bros right next to me (Oh oh)
Chromed out mansion in Paradise
In the sky (Yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, yeah
In the sky
Yeah, yeah
