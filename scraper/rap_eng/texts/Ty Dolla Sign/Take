[Chorus: Arin Ray]
Just wanna take you home
Girl, you know I don't wanna say no more
It's the truth, just want you
I wanna take you home, yeah
Girl, you know I don't wanna play no more
It's the truth, I want you, want you

[Verse 1: Arin Ray]
Automatic waves when we touch base
Just tryna fuck a bad bitch, it's a good day
We talk now and later, ain't just tryna parlay
Tried to tell you not to bring that ass around me, okay?
No tease, I want it all, love
Don't trip, I won't get caught up, ayy
You got work, you better call off, off
Whole week, you'll need it all off
Baby, I don't mean to tell you what to do
But it's all this tension

[Chorus: Arin Ray]
Just wanna take you home
Girl, you know I don't wanna say no more
It's the truth, just want you
I wanna take you home, yeah
Girl, you know I don't wanna play no more

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla $ign
We can take our time, we can take our time
I'ma long stroke it for a long time
Swimmin' in your pussy, I'ma dive in
Your nigga keep blowin' up your line, put it on silent
Okay, I just play my role
Told me we should take it slow, yeah
Sex so good, got you shook, yeah
Sex so good, got you hooked, yeah, yeah
Baby I don't mean to tell you what to do
But there's so much anguish

[Chorus: Arin Ray]
Just wanna take you home
Girl, you know I don't wanna say no more
It's the truth, just want you
I wanna take you home, yeah
Girl, you know I don't wanna play no more
It's the truth, I want you, want you

[Beat Switch]

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
I love your assets, baby
Get up and get this, oh, babe
I love your body sight, baby
I love it, baby
Just give it time
I know you're mine
Just give it time
