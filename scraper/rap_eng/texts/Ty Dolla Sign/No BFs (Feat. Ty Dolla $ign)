No boyfriends allowed up in this party
I got your girl rolling up my gas gettin naughty
Wondering why she don't pick up your calls
She with me and she won't be back till the top of the morning

I got all my haters outside in the hallway
If you out here looking for her it's going to be a long day
Got your girlfriend gettin naughty
No boyfriends allowed up in this party, this party

No boyfriends allowed up in this party
Told me she got more friends in the lobby
We goin to smoke it up till it's gone
Imma bus it like a firearm
She got secrets she would never tell ya
Cheated on her now you're taking L's yeah

Thought you knew these hoes ain't loyal
You fell in love I'm sorry for ya

Somewhere with no service by the beach
Driving through the streets she got me pullin on her hair
We living in the moment and I swear this shit ain’t fair
