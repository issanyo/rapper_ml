[Intro: YG]
Aye, Ty, this money shit brazy, my nigga

[Pre-Hook: YG]
I just had to dump me a bitch
I just had to lighten up my wrist
I just had to tighten up the clique
Welcome to the life of a rich nigga

[Hook: YG]
Rich nigga, yeah, yeah, a rich nigga
Got a hundred on me right now, this nigga
Yeah, rich nigga
Yeah, yeah, yeah, a rich nigga

[Verse: Ty Dolla $ign]
I just got back from El Paso
I just had to double up my cash flow
I just had to stay commercial
Hit your bitch and put my thumb in her asshole
And I met her in my DM
I just woke up at 2 p.m
I just spent 10 racks on my BM
Young rich niggas, yeah we be them
And all my cars twin turbo
Every time I see the pigs, they get swerved on
Your bitch came to the club with no panties on
Got my finger in her pussy on the dance floor
Oh, na na na
Hundred pounds of kush up in my garage
Got rid of that, so you know I'm tryna re-up
Baggies with the Vans, bitch I gotta stay G'd up

[Pre-Hook: YG & Ty Dolla $ign]
I just had to dump me a bitch
I just had to lighten up my wrist
I just had to tighten up the clique
Welcome to the life of a rich nigga

[Hook: YG & Ty Dolla $ign]
Rich nigga, yeah, yeah, a rich nigga
Got a hundred on me right now, this nigga
Yeah, rich nigga
Yeah, yeah, yeah, a rich nigga

[Outro: YG]
I just slid out the bank, though
My theme song should be Lil' Boosie Bankroll
Bankroll after bankroll
Big Crib in the shop for them stank hoes
