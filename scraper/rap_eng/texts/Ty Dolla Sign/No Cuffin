The same shit that you loving
The same shit that I’m cutting
The same shit that you kissing
The same shit that I’m missing
But we ain’t doing no cuffing
We ain’t doing no cuffing
We ain’t doing no cuffing
We ain’t doing no cuffing

[Verse 1: T-Wayne]
We ain’t doing no cuffing over here
We ain’t doing no cuffing over here
All we do is get buckets over here
All we do is get buckets over here
Hit me on my line cause you looking kinda good baby
I’ma hit you with the wood baby
You got a boyfriend, I’m wishing that he would baby
I just hop inside the stud baby
I’m from the home of the Rangers
I would never cuff a stranger
Hit her with the cliffhanger
Got her thinking I’ma hang her
I don’t do it like them other guys
All I ever wanted was a prize
If shawty says she want to ride
You can hop in a car and drive

[Hook: T-Wayne]
The same shit that you loving
The same shit that I’m cutting
The same shit that you kissing
The same shit that I’m missing
But we ain’t doing no cuffing
We ain’t doing no cuffing
We ain’t doing no cuffing
We ain’t doing no cuffing

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh, no cuffing, no cuffing
Just a whole lot of drinking and smoking and cutting, yeah
We party every weekend
Told lil mama pull up and bring friends
I got a fresh pound of OG
Fuck these bitches, I be smoking with the homies
No cuffing, it’s still fuck the police
Told her touch it, told her suck it, no teeth
Hit it from the back and she love that
All this money and she love that
Other bad bitches, yeah she love that
Instagram likes, yeah she love that
Let her drive the foreign, yeah she love that
Say her man boring, she don’t want that
Said she getting back together, now you back

[Hook: T-Wayne]
The same shit that you loving
The same shit that I’m cutting
The same shit that you kissing
The same shit that I’m missing
But we ain’t doing no cuffing
We ain’t doing no cuffing
We ain’t doing no cuffing
We ain’t doing no cuffing
