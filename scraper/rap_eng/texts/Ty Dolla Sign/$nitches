[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Say she wanna be held like a mink in the winter, no no
She ask me how do I feel, how do I feel, no no
You know snitches get stitches (snitches get snitches)
Ignorance is bliss, can a nigga get a witness?
I'll tell you what
I ain’t gotta trick on nothing, no no
I ain't tripping on you, I ain't tripping, I ain't tricking on you
They be tricking on you but I ain't tricking on you
They be snitching telling me all about you
I'ma take my time, that's what a nigga gonna do
I ain't tripping I ain't tricking on you, they be tricking on you
But I ain't tricking on you
They told me all about you, oh no

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
You ain't gotta plan on it
Me sitting on a stand with a bible with a hand on it
They be talking like the man on it
You can play the tape and understand what he saying on it
Niggas sounding like Sam on it, Teflon Don why you sticking to the pan homie
From a good fella to a teller
Niggas droppin dimes in the bags in the bands on it
I'ma just land on it
Plant my flag like a moon with a man on it
They be singing to the choir with a wire
But this the eighteen gold chains with the van on it
This the eighteen gold chains with the van on it
Life is a beach with some sand and a tan on it
But it's getting too high
Spread the money out now look like a fan on it

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Say she wanna be held like a mink in the winter, no no
She ask me how do I feel, how do I feel, no no
You know snitches get stitches (snitches get snitches)
Ignorance is bliss, can a nigga get a witness?
I'll tell you what
I ain’t gotta trick on nothing, no no
I ain't tripping on you, I ain't tripping, I ain't tricking on you
They be tricking on you but I ain't tricking on you
They be snitching telling me all about you
I'ma take my time, that's what a nigga gonna do
I ain't tripping I ain't tricking on you, they be tricking on you
But I ain't tricking on you
They told me all about you, oh no

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Now if you only love me for the money
Then that mean you gon leave if they come and take it from me
Now I ain't saying I ain't Fort Knox
But you never know who be at the do' when the door knock
That's why we keep the door locked
Keep an open mind but I ain't messing with the door stops
God forbid that the dough stop
If the paper wrinkle we can hit it with the Botox
Nigga get fo' shots smelling new money call it their nose jobs
And we been working for it so hard
Best believe we ain't hurting for a blowjob
Why you twerking for it so hard?
Working with them people for some Goyard
Keep my mind on them gold bars
Crucial crucial crucial go hard

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Say she wanna be held like a mink in the winter, no no
She ask me how do I feel, how do I feel, no no
You know snitches get stitches (snitches get snitches)
Ignorance is bliss, can a nigga get a witness?
I'll tell you what
I ain’t gotta trick on nothing, no no
I ain't tripping on you, I ain't tripping, I ain't tricking on you
They be tricking on you but I ain't tricking on you
They be snitching telling me all about you
I'ma take my time, that's what a nigga gonna do
I ain't tripping I ain't tricking on you, they be tricking on you
But I ain't tricking on you
They told me all about you, oh no

[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco]
Independent women get the "all cool"
Gold digging bitches get the door foo
Don't misinterpret what you're hearing
I ain't tryna get out, I'm tryna put some years in
And ya gotta lay a foundation
Break it down basic can't play around payin
Niggas ain't saying they ain't makin downpayments
But we ain't at the station, turning State, making statements

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Say she wanna be held like a mink in the winter, no no
She ask me how do I feel, how do I feel, no no
You know snitches get stitches (snitches get snitches)
Ignorance is bliss, can a nigga get a witness?
I'll tell you what
I ain’t gotta trick on nothing, no no
I ain't tripping on you, I ain't tripping, I ain't tricking on you
They be tricking on you but I ain't tricking on you
They be snitching telling me all about you
I'ma take my time, that's what a nigga gonna do
I ain't tripping I ain't tricking on you, they be tricking on you
But I ain't tricking on you
They told me all about you, oh no
