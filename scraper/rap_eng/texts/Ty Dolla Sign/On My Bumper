[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
Got all these girls (girls)
All these girls (girls)
Got all these girls on my bumper (ooh yeah)
All these girls (all these girls)
All these girls (all these girls)
All these girls on my bumper

[Verse 1: Joe Moses]
You see lately I've been feelin', enjoyin' my life chillin'
When you was in your feelin', she wanna be winnin'
And you discovered too many problems, it's too many hotties
For me to sit for too many hours, it's no logic
Back then they didn't want me, now they be stressed out
Valuable lesson learned to all the women who missed out
A little too grown to be in church with your breasts out
Move my new ho across the street from my ex house
Petty, got my eye on it like Fetty
The same woman dissed me, the same ones who ready
The same ones curved me, the same ones be textin'
But now I'm just flexin', Ty I'm just flexin' for real

[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
Got all these girls (girls)
All these girls (girls)
Got all these girls on my bumper (ooh yeah)
All these girls (all these girls)
All these girls (all these girls)
All these girls on my bumper

[Verse 2: Ty]
Baby pull up on me
Baby pull up on me
Baby pull up on me
I've been drivin' reckless
Peep the VVS in my new Rolly
Back it up, fuck it up, you the one
You know I run it up on my baby
Damn damn damn
You look better than you do on the 'gram
Back it up on me like whoa whoa whoa
Ride the wave like roll roll roll roll roll
Got me like down down down
You know I like it when you do with no hands
Back it up on me like whoa
Then I gotta go pedal to the flo'
Because you know

[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
Got all these girls (girls)
All these girls (girls)
Got all these girls on my bumper (ooh yeah)
All these girls (all these girls)
All these girls (all these girls)
All these girls on my bumper

[Verse 3: Joe Moses]
You see lately I've been living, enjoyin' my life chillin'
When you get out your feelin', maybe I consider
My ex woman was bitter, take a shot to the liver
The same ones be laughin' now cry me a river
The same ones was frontin' now blowin' my cellie
She never made the mistake to wifin' up a headache
Shoe never made the mistake of sleeping with no jacket
And calling you out your name but sure callin' you rachet
Intrigued but not flattered, who's callin', it don't matter
Paragraphs on the 'gram, you mad, you gotta add her
I laugh, the grass ain't greener between her
Girl we done, it was just a little fun
So now you wanna make up rumors and hit the shade room
The same one telling you leave, she in the living room
I had to stop playing fasho' and do me
Can't fight for no woman who ain't afraid to lose a me
And that's real

[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
Got all these girls (girls)
All these girls (girls)
Got all these girls on my bumper (ooh yeah)
All these girls (all these girls)
All these girls (all these girls)
All these girls on my bumper

[Outro: Joe Moses]
We got another one
We got another one
