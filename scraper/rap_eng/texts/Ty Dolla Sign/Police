[Intro: YG]
Damn Bitch
Fuck off, always on my head bout some bullshit
So what man, you nothing to me

[Verse 1: YG]
Yeah that's my other bitch, she be trippin when I say I'm with another bitch
Sold her a dream that won't come true but she hope it is
We blowin blunts like candles, when you make a wish
Going back and forth, arguing about whos mistake it is
You know I ain't the type of nigga for relationships
All these problems like a vacation, I'm getting away from them
Like save the problems for your mama, I ain't buying em
Like girl you the only one I'm wit, she know I'm lying
Talking bout bitches I fucked the first night I met em
Like if you ain't gon do nothing about it, bitch shut up
She tired of my shit, she can't do it, she fed up
And if she lookin for tha dough, I'd be glad to help herâ€™
And she know about my other bitch
If I ain't fucking her, she know who I'm fucking wit
And I'm caught up in the mix
Cuz I'm in love with this girl but I love the other bitch

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign] (x2)
I think she knows about, my other bitch
She's always searching my shit like the police, searching through my shit like the police

[Verse 2: YG]
And my girlfriend came home, warning
She be searching through my shit like she had a warrant
Tryna find out who my who other bitch
Lying to her saying she a good friend, yeah right bitch
And if you ridin wit me, nigga hop in
My other bitch got me feeling like I'm flyer than a rocket
All that bullshit you talking bout you need to stop it
And not appeal but I'm tryna pop, lock and drop it
And we can keep it low nobody gotta know
But sometimes having two bitches the way to go
And if I can't trust some of the homies, I can't trust a ho
Cuz all she wanna do is argue, I said fashoo
And she searching through my shit like she the police
I know we've been talking for a minute but you don't know me
And I think she know about my other bitch
But she can't do nothing about it but just live with it

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign] (x2)
I think she knows about, my other bitch
She's always searching my shit like the police, searching through my shit like the police

[Verse 3: YG]
I'm telling her how it is, she say stop playing stupid
I'm in the streets, on the grind tryna do me
She asking me questions, where you at? who are you with?
Jumping to conclusions that I'm fucking with a new bitch
So, I bought her flowers on the weekend
Hope she forgives me for cheatin
But if she don't I'mma be cool, cuz I'mma go back to girlfriend number two

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign] (x2)
I think she knows about, my other bitch
She's always searching my shit like the police, searching through my shit like the police
