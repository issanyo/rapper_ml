And when does the story end?
The life you lead is the legacy you leave
My eulogy was read by a stranger
Full of love, but with misplaced anger
I never knew I inspired you
Just breathe
Life is too short
Enjoy this moment

They hate me 'cause I'm positive
Their negativity multiplies and the result is still positive
Tell your story before they do
Here's to celebrate the accomplishment that
They said we wouldn't make it but they have to keep watching it
I'm the greatest and I know that
I'm the greatest and I own that
I'm the greatest and I've shown that

This is my story
But where does it end?
The life you lead is the legacy you leave
My eulogy was read by a stranger
Full of love, but with misplaced anger
I never knew I inspired you
