[Intro: Kid Ink, Chris Brown & Both]
I said why you over there lookin' at me (whoop)
While I'm with my girlfriend?
Why you over there lookin' at me and my girlfriend?
Let's take it to the hotel, oh, woah, let's take it to the hotel, oh, woah

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Yeah, I said why you over there lookin'? (Woah)
Got a staring problem or you fuckin'? (Whoop)
I know you see my girl, stop frontin' (wait)
I could tell you up to a lil' somethin', hol' up
I'ma play it cool, baby, roll one (yeah)
While you make your way and get over here (yeah)
My girl ain't down, then it's over (woo)
Just tell her that she look good when I'm over there (yeah)
In the first place, pour one up
Baby, don't be too thirsty
Groupie love ain't ever gon' work see (uh)
Hoes ain't loyal and never keep it lowkey
That ain't alright (yeah)
I'ma take a shot, couple shots through the night
Tell a joke, keep it fun, make her feel it's alright (whoop)
Give you the game wholesale (whoop)
And bet a hundred that I take 'em to the hotel

[Chorus: Kid Ink, Chris Brown & Both]
I said why you over there lookin' at me (whoop)
While I'm with my girlfriend?
Why you over there lookin' at me and my girlfriend?
Let's take it to the hotel, oh, woah, we could take it there (woah)
Let's take it to the hotel, oh, woah baby, we could take it there (woah)
Take it to the hotel, baby, leave with me
Know I got a penthouse suite
I said why you over there lookin' at me
While I'm with my girlfriend??

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
It's kinda hard when I see you lookin' over here with them eyes
I got a girl but I'm feeling your body, so I'ma have to just play both sides
I hope she don't come over here 'cause I'm with my girl, you know I love her
I got two of my bitches in the club and they know about each other, oh, no

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
Uh, but a nigga never Paranoid
You fuckin' with a man, not a little boy
What? I could barely hear your lil' voice
In the club but your body makin' all the noise
Clap it up, stack it up
Baby, where your purse? Just pack it up
And grab her hand, tell her we should go now
If you really wanna take this party to the hotel

[Chorus: Kid Ink, Chris Brown & Both]
I said, said why you over there lookin' at me (whoop)
While I'm with my girlfriend?
Why you over there lookin' at me and my girlfriend?
Let's take it to the hotel, oh, woah, we could take it there (woah)
Let's take it to the hotel, oh, woah baby, we could take it there (woah)
Take it to the hotel, baby, leave with me
Know I got a penthouse suite
I said why you over there lookin' at me
While I'm with my girlfriend?

[Verse 4: Kid Ink]
Over there lookin' all suspicious
Get a clue, girl, don't be a mystery
I see you likin' on all my pictures
Of me and my bitch up in all of our business (woah)
So, you gotta know it ain't a limit to
What a pill and the liquor do (nah)
Make a straight girl go down, just spit down
I might fuck around and lick her too
It ain't a problem, my metabolism high
Eat you both up for dinner (woah)
Just keep it real with a real motherfucker
Ain't got time for no pretenders
Now just bring it to me
That fleek, that freak, no classy stuff (uh)
Been pushin' up, don't pussy out (uh)
Bitch, what you really on? (Nah, what?)

[Chorus: Kid Ink, Chris Brown & Both]
I said, said why you over there lookin' at me (whoop)
While I'm with my girlfriend?
Why you over there lookin' at me and my girlfriend?
Let's take it to the hotel, oh, woah, we could take it there (woah)
Let's take it to the hotel, oh, woah baby, we could take it there (woah)
Take it to the hotel, baby, leave with me
Know I got a penthouse suite
I said why you over there lookin' at me
While I'm with my girlfriend?
