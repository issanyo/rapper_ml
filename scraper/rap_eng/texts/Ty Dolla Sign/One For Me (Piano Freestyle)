[Verse 1]
Oh lord
Loving your simple style, style
When you move girl I feel your style, style
When you leave me that's a minus
Say together we're a stronger soul
Whine whine say no man can control
If feels better than Silver and Gold
Is it forever girl? let me know
Is it forever girl? let me know
Can you be the one for me baby
Me wanna care for you love you forever
Can it be just for me baby
Sexiness, all this loving forever
Baby girl you're a kiss from a rose
Girl just love me I swear I no boast
Say your love like a kiss from a rose
When I see you I know

[Hook]
You're the one, baby baby baby
Call on me, yeaaaaah, girl you can
All I want yeah, cause all I want is to be
You're the one

[Bridge]
Say if you love the guy say aaah
Say if you are the one say I
Say if you got the one you really want to die for
Or you got the one you can burst a shot for
Just say aaah

[Outro]
My baby is sent from heaven
She's sent from heaven
My baby love me long time
She need me one time
Soulchild on the beat..
