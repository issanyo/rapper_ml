[Intro: Kid Ink]
Yeah yeah
Alright

[Hook: Kid Ink & Ty Dolla $ign]
No you ain't safe, no you ain't safe
No you ain't safe, no you ain't safe
No you ain't safe, no you ain't
Why you gotta look so
Dangerous, dangerous
No you ain't
Dangerous, dangerous
Why you gotta look so

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
C-Cold, think I need a coat on
Talkin' bout goin' home
No you ain't
Pause
Probably got a man though
But you came here alone cuz he can't
Take care, go ahead taste this
Lemme get ya mind right
Might just erase it
First she was being so patient
Now you so anxious
Ain't nobody racin'
Lets slow it down for me
Park break on the base
I could tell you a freak
Its written all in your face
When it ain't no space

[Hook: Kid Ink & Ty Dolla $ign]
No you ain't safe, no you ain't safe
No you ain't safe, no you ain't safe
No you ain't safe, no you ain't
Why you gotta look so
Dangerous, dangerous
No you ain't
Dangerous, dangerous
Why you gotta look so

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Why you gotta look so dangerous
Why these bitch niggas hate on us
Why these new niggas wanna hang with us
Wasn't on the block bangin' with us
Ever made love to a stranger
Do you only fuck with niggas gettin' paper
If its real and we know so
Roll up we gone smoke some
You a [?] and your ex say
Shoulda been with a real one in the first place
Go girl its your birthday
Her weave ain't right
She thirsty, ayy
These bitches ain't loyal
These bitches don't know shit
What they talkin' bout
Why you gotta be this bad
Why you got so much ass

[Hook: Kid Ink & Ty Dolla $ign]
No you ain't safe, no you ain't safe
No you ain't safe, no you ain't safe
No you ain't safe, no you ain't
Why you gotta look so
Dangerous, dangerous
No you ain't
Dangerous, dangerous
Why you gotta look so

[Verse 3: Juliann]
Where the plug baby
Bring the drugs baby
Don't look at me too long
You'll fall in love baby
I would be screamin' out "No new friends"
But hell nah, I love my new bitches
Know a lot of strippers
And I know a lot of trappin' niggas
Hoes don't love havin' babies
They just love trappin' niggas
I'm way to high
Why don't you go and make them lights dim
If that pussy feel like Biggie Smalls
Treat her like Lil Kim
Yeah!
I see your bitch lookin' thirsty
Yeah!
They don't make em' like me no more (like me no more)
You dumb if you let me go (you crazy)
You dumb if you let me go (don't do it)
It don't get no better, no
It don't get no better, no
It don't get no better, no
It don't get no better, no

[Hook: Kid Ink & Ty Dolla $ign]
No you ain't safe, no you ain't safe
No you ain't safe, no you ain't safe
No you ain't safe, no you ain't
Why you gotta look so
Dangerous, dangerous
No you ain't
Dangerous, dangerous
Why you gotta look so
