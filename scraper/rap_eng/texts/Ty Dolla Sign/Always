[Hook: Reem Riches + Ty Dolla $ign]
Gold Rollie on my wrist at a young age
I'm stuck in my young ways
Fuck bitches get money that's always
Nigga that's always
That's always, nigga that's always
That's always, that's always
Nigga that's always, like everyday


[Verse 1: Reem Riches]
Uh, that's always
I was gettin' money in the hallways
Pussy in the hallway, always
Young fly nigga, couldn't keep the bitches off me
Now these hoes love a nigga cause I rap
Rollie on my wrist, I ain't gettin' this from rap
I cop this shit with racks, tell these niggas fall back
Cause my niggas is stretch leave your whip on four flats

[Verse 2: Teecee4800]
I pull up in a drop top
I rap now but I still pop
Cash out, that's always
You crack the safe nigga, nigga that's always
Gettin' now watch me blowin'
Hundred racks in the safe, you ain't even knowin'

MTM got a nigga, pockets feelin' richer
Ever since a young nigga I ain't been the same
Cashed out, fast need everything
