[Chorus]
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry, Yeah yeah yeaahhh

[Verse 1]
Got no ice, DJ's not here and I've called him more than twice, but he won't pick up
Where the guys? I've had a couple of friends come, not the ones I really like
What the fuck?

[Chorus]
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry too if it happened to you
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry, Yeah yeah yeaahhh

[Verse 2]
I was gonna do it big, make it live for a hundred nights
I put my best dress on, overpriced, now the zipper broke in the back so my crack's hanging out
I wish they'd all go home

[Chorus]
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry too if it happened to you
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry, Yeah yeah yeaahhh

[Chorus]
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry too if it happened to you
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry, Yeah yeah yeaahhh


[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
It's my party, I got kush I got molly
Thats your girl, she ain't cute, but she got body
I'ma get her, I'ma hit it, then forget her
You can take her back like a indian giver
Dolla $ign yeah I'm all she ever want to see
She in bed with you, but she still texting me
She wanna turn up with a real one
Pop blue xans now she can't feel nothing
Gone to the moon I got on space jams
Got a white girl and she got a spray tan
I'ma introduce her to my black bitch
Threesome we're an ice cream sandwich
It's my party, it's my party, it's my party
Got your main bitch and she getting naughty
If she don't tell me what she wanna do
You a bitch you can cry if you want to

[Chorus]
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry too if it happened to you
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry, Yeah yeah yeaahhh
