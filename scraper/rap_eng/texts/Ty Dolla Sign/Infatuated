[Verse 1]
Oh, I came to town, what it is, girlfriend?
Do you feel what you feel, girlfriend?
Stare at me when I sleep, girlfriend
Cause you think that you're falling in love, love, oh
Hanging on every word I say
Lies, and I need to back away
I knew that one day I'll make you say
Say you think that you're falling in love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
But you're just

[Hook]
Infatuated, Infatuated
Uh, uh, uh Infatuated, Infatuated

[Verse 2]
Looking at me with your "fuck me" eyes
Moving over with your skirt hitched high
Ready to give me everything tonight
You think that you're falling in love
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Homie, when you get down by my side till the morning come
Tell me you wanna be my only one
And that you're falling in love, oh, oh!
But shawty's
