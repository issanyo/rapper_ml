[Intro: DP Beats]
When I'm with my Taylor Gang niggas
There's only a few things we need
Hey Ty, Hey Tuki, let 'em know

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Hundred to the end
I could not pretend hoe
I don't fuck with you
But I fuck your friend though
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Hundred to the end
I could not pretend hoe
I don't fuck with you
But I fuck your friend though

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
She ain't got no titty but she got some ass
Girl I ain't a pimp but I am a man
Iin high school I used to buy one hundred sack
My grandmother used to drive that Cadillac
Your bitch just tell me "where you at?"
I already fucked so I ain't hit her back
I came through strapped like "where my money at"
If it ain't OG I want my money back
Tuki gonna ride for 'sho
Richard gonna ride for 'sho
Wiz gonna ride for 'sho
Burning my Cholo
Chevy gon' go, go
We don't go, oh

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Hundred to the end
I could not pretend hoe
I don't fuck with you
But I fuck your friend though
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Hundred to the end
I could not pretend hoe
I don't fuck with you
But I fuck your friend though

[Verse 2: Tuki Carter]
Skrt up in it, chop it, flip it
Drink some gin and bust up in it
Never trust a strap up with it
Double tap it a picture with it
Get a nigga, roll up in it
Fuck a friend, include her in it
Do some magic, disappear
Shining crystals, chandelier
Pimpin' listening, crystal clear
Smoked this weed, I'm out of here
Oversmoke, it's clouds in here
Bust your bitch awhile ago
Bust a friend a night ago
Pimpin', listen here
I'm consistent here
Consistent to Gin and Beer
Fuck a Gin and fear
Got some nigga's here
Get some friends and here
Friends and benefits, some and drink and fuck
Think slow but last longer
Stroke it like a messiah
But you sleep the [?]
Yeah you sleep the hoe, no [?]

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Hundred to the end
I could not pretend hoe
I don't fuck with you
But I fuck your friend though
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Pussy, Weed and Gin, hoe
Hundred to the end
I could not pretend hoe
I don't fuck with you
But I fuck your friend though

[Outro: DP Beats]
2 more than 98 is the way we keep it
You already know what it is
It's Taylor Gang over anything
You bitch, you
