Get what I want, ge-get what I want (x2)
Get what I want, when I need it
You can call me greedy


Call me what you want
I been hurt, been worse
If there's "Rozay" in this bitch
Bet I'm poppin' it first
That new Beamer;s comin' out
I'll be coppin' it first
If you seen 'em in some hot shit
I was rocking it first

I keep it fresher than the next, indeed
Make her see her ex with me
I'm bad, bad (x2)
When I pull up to the club, I stop
Just so you can jock
I'm bad, bad (x2)

Run that, gimmie that boy (x2)
Run that, ey, show me what you got
The boys always give me what I want, want, want

Get what I want, ge-get what I want (x2)
Get what I want, when I need it
You can call me greedy. (x2)

Get what I want, call me greedy
I'm so high maintenance and needy
Stop it, with all that gossip
Bitch, do you, while you're ridin' my tip
A lot of y'all Hollywood drama, past it
Cut, bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it
Say it to my face, like Stacy...
You'll never catch me naked like Ri of Casey...

Jumping into stores like jumping into conclusions
