[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Riding me like she ride the beat
Top double G, Chanel on her feet
Ghost ride the Wraith, house on my name
Hotel on my wrist, that be that Patek, yeah
Blow 100 bands 'cause I fuck with it
Pull up in the Benz 'cause I fuck with that bitch
Living thug life 'cause that shit chose me
Gh-gh-ghost all white and your bitch in here with me

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Ooh, you love Dolla tonight, mmm
Hmm, oh, we fucking tonight?
Bottom line, I just need me some top, mmm
Pull up in the Uber, you might leave in the drop, ooh
Pretty bitch named Lexus
Hit her in the dressing room at Saks Fifth
I like that, double tapped it
Had her doing backflips on the mattress
I just showed her

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & (Yo Gotti)]
Ayy, baby girl, just make it simple (ayy, make it simple, shawty)
I don't want no maybe (I am)

Baby girl, just make it simple (I am)
Don't want a maybe, oh (Gotti)
I just wanna make it simple
No maybe

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
We don't gotta make it complex, old school on Sunset
Tryna leave my street life but huh, I done done it
Ex bitch left, just so she could run back
Say I make her wet when I ask her where my gun at
I like her simple with no makeup on
Told her I'm just tryna take her home
Yeah, I fuck around and changed her life
I motivate you and I fuck you right
Why you overthinking, thinking?
Why you overthinking? Shit's simple
Baby, I'm the last real nigga
She don't fuck with rappers, me neither [?] come
Livin' life on the edge but we fuckin' with a condom
Ridin' Presidential, baby, you ain't with no bumper
I got special sauce, baby, I come from Wakanda
My Lambo' a black panther, Dolla $ign and Gotti, it's a new anthem
Baby, you the shit, Pamper

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Ayy, baby girl, just make it simple
I don't want no maybe
I just wanna make it simple
I don't want no maybe
Baby girl, just make it simple
Don't want a maybe, oh
I just wanna make it simple
No maybe
