[Intro]
Dolla $ign!

[Hook]
If your nigga's trippin' girl, you can bang my line, bang my line
If he start slippin' girl, you can bang my line, bang my line
If he go missin' girl, bang my line, bang my line any time
Bang my line, bang my line, yeah

[Verse 1]
You know he ain't do you right
So you bang my line when it's late at night
When you hit my phone after hours I know the deal
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson, I am for real
I know you want it, yeah, that's how I feel girl
You want a rich nigga with a future
But you stuck at home with a loser
Bet I be there when he fuck up
Bet I let him know that I lucked up
And she know I want a fuck or two
But you see how a real one supposed to do
But girl I promise I'm being so damn honest

[Hook]
If your nigga's trippin' girl, you can bang my line, bang my line
If he start slippin' girl, you can bang my line, bang my line
If he go missin' girl, bang my line, bang my line any time
Bang my line, bang my line, yeah

[Verse 2]
Bang my line when you're lonely
Bang my line when you're horny
Bang my line when you need that
I pull up and beat that like Mayweather
Said fuck your man I do it way better
So when you want it, I be there whenever
Want a rich nigga with a future
Stuck at home with a loser
Bet I be there when he fuck up
Bet I let him know that I lucked up, girl
Cause I fuck with you
Let me show you how a real one supposed to do
Girl I promise I'm bein' so damn honest

[Hook]
If your nigga's trippin' girl, you can bang my line, bang my line
If he start slippin' girl, you can bang my line, bang my line
If he go missin' girl, bang my line, bang my line any time
Bang my line, bang my line, yeah
