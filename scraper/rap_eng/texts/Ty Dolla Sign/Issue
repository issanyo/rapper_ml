[Hook x2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I’m g'on get my issue (x3) (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I don’t do too much talking, I’m tryna come in, get off with it
Tell you what it is, Imma boss up
You like it when I treat you like a toss up
We gon fuck then first to count em
I hope the motherfucker, don’t call back
I ain’t tryna get you caught up
I know you just want to ball up
These hoes ain’t shit, niggas ain’t shit either
So what, we gon do our stuff, yeah
Cause right now ain’t nothing going on, we fucking
And we ain’t worried bout, worried bout nothing

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Red or black, smell the OG gas, classic
Cars and jars, down ass bitch want to be where the clouds are
Every time we make an appearance, they taking the experience
No top, disappearing act, baby girl give me top while I’m steering that
In the cut like no Gs up, what we don’t drink we spill
Glad your iPhone storage full, I told you that shit is real
Home girl in the cut like how I’m gon get this picture
Higher than a motherfucker, liable to cuss a nigga out when I’m on that liquor
Baby face attract a nigga, and my stacks is bigger, so believe that

[Hook x5]

[Interlude: Mike Posner]
Just cause I'm looking in your eyes don't mean shit
I still got my jewelry on while I'm deep in
I slip out the hotel room while you're sleepin'
Never meant to do you wrong (x5)
