[Hook: Trey Songz]
You know you dead wrong
Up in the club, but you left your man home
You couldn't even wait 'til we got to the bedroom
I know it ain't good, but these hoes gon' do what they want, want

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Pull up in a Porsche, no rental
No key, now she on me
Know the star shit fuckin' with your mental
Wanna be my tenderoni?
Now we chillin' poolside for the night
Hollywood sign, I ain't caught up in the lights
Trigga baby, I'ma do you right
Don't make me have to tell you twice

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
I fuck 'em all the time but you know I never wife 'em, ah
Real nigga no lie, man I swear these hoes triflin', ah
But I'ma give her what she like, beat it down like Tyson, ah
It's the pretty ones that you really need to keep your eye on

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You know you dead wrong
Up in the club, but you left your man home
You couldn't even wait 'til we got to the bedroom
I know it ain't good, but these hoes gon' do what they want, want

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I just left the show with a two piece
Dollar sign, got groupies
I'ma take her to the motherfuckin' hotel
Let her do her, then do me, oh
One bad light-skinned and an Asian
I'ma stack em up like Legos
She call me papi, ain't none of us Spanish
But I let her chupar mis huevos

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
We be fuckin' all the time but she know I'll never wife her, nah
Had her in a feelin' when she see me with my white girl, ah
She act square around her nigga but when she with me she like girls, ah
It's the pretty girls that you really need to keep your eye on, oh

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You know you dead wrong
Up in the club, but you left your man home
You couldn't even wait 'til we got to the bedroom
I know it ain't good, but these hoes gon' do what they want, want

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
Who am I to judge you?
I love you whenever you're near
Bring your body here
Right now, I'ma knock it right down
Say you got a nigga? Go figure
Take another sip of this liquor
Talk a little shit, but my dick much bigger
Baby, let me tell you a lil something 'bout Trigga

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
I fuck 'em all the time but you know I never wife 'em, ah
Real nigga no lie, man I swear these hoes triflin', ah
But I'ma give her what she like, beat it down like Tyson, ah
It's the pretty ones that you really need to keep your eye on

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You know you dead wrong
Up in the club, but you left your man home
You couldn't even wait 'til we got to the bedroom
I know it ain't good, but these hoes gon' do what they want, want
You know you dead wrong
