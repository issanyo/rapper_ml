[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Mmm, mmm
Oh, mmm

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I ain't mean to make you mad
I ain't mean to make you mad at me
I ain't really mean that I ain't mean to make you mad
I just wanna make it up, mm
Let's smoke and let's fuck and get over it
I'm done with the talking, I'm over it
We go through the motions, we up and down
We made it this far, lemme know if you still down
All the shit we been through, lemme know if you still down
We ain't got nothing to lose

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
Uh, you talking like Twenty not good enough
We fight and we fuck and that's good enough
You so from Atlanta, don't wanna move
I'm so 'bout a check, I don't wanna lose
I put you on Kenzo and Gucci
"Aye, Twenty, I heard you with Gucci"
I'm knowing, I'm knowing you loving me
Stay real and stay down, it's 'bout loyalty

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I ain't mean to make you mad
I ain't mean to make you mad at me
I ain't really mean that I ain't mean to make you mad
I just wanna make it up, mm
Let's smoke and let's fuck and get over it
I'm done with the talking, I'm over it
We go through the motions, we up and down
We made it this far, lemme know if you still down
All the shit we been through, lemme know if you still down
We ain't got nothing to lose

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
"Dolla, please don't make me look stupid
I know that you got all the groupies
You come back around and you hit me raw"
I swear I don't give it to no one else
Trust, trust me, baby
Ten toes down, you got a real one, yeah
Someone's in they feelings, yeah
Slow down, girl, I'm human, yeah

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
We ain't gotta get a vibe
Smoke a J and keep it live
Baby, we should go inside
And make love

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I ain't mean to make you mad
I ain't mean to make you mad at me
I ain't really mean that I ain't mean to make you mad
I just wanna make it up, mm
Let's smoke and let's fuck and get over it
I'm done with the talking, I'm over it
We go through the motions, we up and down
We made it this far, lemme know if you still down
All the shit we been through, lemme know if you still down
We ain't got nothing to lose
