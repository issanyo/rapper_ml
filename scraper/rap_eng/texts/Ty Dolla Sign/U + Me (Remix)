[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Must've been crazy to think that you loved me
I saw all the signs but I just couldn't say nothing
I did the time across the line for you
'Cause I can't see myself with nobody else but you
Tell me what you're thinking 'cause this is what you wanted
Should've been the one to hold me when I got lonely
'Cause every time I think of the lies you told to me
Make it easy for me to leave

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
You plus me, yeah
Swear it took a long time for you to trust me
Tried to tell me all the time how much you fought with me
Swear you showed me how to love and what it really means, what it really means
10 toes stomped down
Had to leave 'em all alone and lock my baby down
You know I keep you in designer, you my baby now
Girl, you know I been stacking dough, no more Macy's now

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Ty Dolla $ign]
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me
You plus me, babe, oh yeah, oh
You plus me, oh
You plus me

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Gotta keep on pushing and love myself through the hard times
Gotta keep my patience, still a long way to go now
There's so much to learn
When we trust the love that's deep in us
Then love will return (yes, it will)
Boy this thing was, a love lesson

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Ty Dolla $ign]
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me

[Outro]
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me
