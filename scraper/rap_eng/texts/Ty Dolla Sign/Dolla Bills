Why steady calling, I'm your Ex
I'm too busy runnin' up a check
I ain't tryna hear what you sayin' now
My love speak a different language
I guess you'll never ever understand it
Boy I promise I ain’t budging
If I didn't make it clear

Take your heart throw it in a trash
I’m gonna turn your love into some stacks
Cause cash rules everything around me
