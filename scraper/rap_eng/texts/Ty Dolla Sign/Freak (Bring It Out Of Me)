[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla $ign, ooh yeah

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Have you ever been lied to?
Got drunk, got high too
Had sex on the first night
And it was just alright
You just wanna have fun
You just wanna wild out
You just wanna stunt on your ex with your next
Like bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
With me, with you right now
Right now, right now, aye
Put it on me right now
Right now, right now

[Chorus: Usher]
I'm just a freak and I can't help it
Bring your girlfriend, don't be selfish
Tonight is what we make it
You should bring it out of me
I'm just a freak and I can't help it
Bring your girlfriend, don't be selfish
Tonight is what we make it
Bring it out of me, listen

[Post-Chorus: Usher]
You know what you doin'
You know I can't take it
You know how I like it
You know how bad I need it every time I see it
You know what you doin'
You know I can't take it
You know how I like it
You know how bad I need it every time I see it

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
In the city
Got you feelin' me
Smoke weed in the club, f**k security
And my enemies
Bottles up, if you get money
Where the pretty girls?

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
With me, with you right now
Right now, right now, aye
Put it on me right now
Right now, right now

[Chorus: Usher]
I'm just a freak and I can't help it
Bring your girlfriend, don't be selfish
Tonight is what we make it
You should bring it out of me
I'm just a freak and I can't help it
Bring your girlfriend, don't be selfish
Tonight is what we make it
Bring it out of me, listen

[Post-Chorus: Usher]
You know what you doin'
You know I can't take it
You know how I like it
You know how bad I need it every time I see it
You know what you doin'
You know I can't take it
You know how I like it
You know how bad I need it every time I see it

[Bridge: Usher & Ty Dolla $ign]
When you're here
When you're here
It's nothing I can do
It's nothing I can do
When you're near
When you're near
I don't have control
I don't have control

[Chorus: Usher]
I'm just a freak and I can't help it
Bring your girlfriend, don't be selfish
Tonight is what we make it
You should bring it out of me
I'm just a freak and I can't help it
Bring your girlfriend, don't be selfish
Tonight is what we make it
Bring it out of me, listen

[Post-Chorus: Usher]
You know what you doin'
You know I can't take it
You know how I like it
You know how bad I need it every time I see it
You know what you doin'
You know I can't take it
You know how I like it
You know how bad I need it every time I see it
