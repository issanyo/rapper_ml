[Hook]
I swear that wasn't good sex
That's all, that's all we ever did
But she be on that bullshit
That's all, that's all she ever is
So I tell her hold up, wait a minute
You should gonna let me put the dollar sign it
Tell her hold up, wait a minute
You should let the mother fucker gangsta hit it

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I told her fuck with that dollar sign
That gangsta shit, that LA shit
That pull up in that BMW and that Ti$a, that Joy Rich
That blunt lit
That jolly rancher in the bottom of that cup of that purple shit
That's bo ho, and these polo
And the hand on your head, that's for loco
And thats pusha ink, and I push it good
Goons with me and I push the hood
Took the bitch, she fell in love
Cause my dreads long and I'm tatted up
Took her home and I beat it up
Took her home and I beat it up
Took ya bitch, she fell in love
Cause my dick long and I set it up

[Hook]

Hold up, tell me why you're tripping
Used to let a nigga hit it, home run every evening
Leaving limping, cause I threw that ass up
Like a catapult I just want that good
But you got such a bad attitude
For no reason, it's early Sunday morning
I ain't saying you easy, but get back on your G shit
Cause I'm on one, I lit two blunts
I take three shots and that ku klux
That white girl come rock my mike tonight girl

[Hook]
