[Intro: Young Thug]
You should go and get what you want
You should ans-answer your door
You know how I feel about you
I don't plan on taking no deals, no need to
I hope you're ready for it, you know you owe me
Her nickname is thang, she like to get cozy
I hope it ain't a prank when you approach me
I wanna know about this thang, get on to me

And she got a nine, ain't talkin' Rondo
Got money on his head like it's a poncho (poncho)
I got money I can spread, I'm talking Dow Jones
I spread the money on this hoe (I spread the money on this hoe)

Put your request in and get what you want

Yeah, say she love my type, but she know she ain't ever had this
She ain't ever had it like this
No, I ain't her man, but I'm here when she wanna get managed
Shawty know she bad, but she don't even know she the baddest
When it come to checks, after ass, man, I don't need the fattest
I'm on whatever you on
I'm on whatever you on
I'm on whatever you on
I'm on whatever you on
I'm on whatever you on
I'm on whatever you on
