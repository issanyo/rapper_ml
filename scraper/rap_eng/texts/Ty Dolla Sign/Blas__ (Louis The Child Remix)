[Hook: Future & Ty Dolla $ign]
Ordered up a hundred rosés, need a Benz like blasé, blasé
I'm just, whipping Maserati, I'm just (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Blasé, blasé, blasé
Blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé
Whipping Maserati (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé, yeah, yeah
Blasé, blasé, blasé

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Started from the ground, I'm that, I'm that, now
I stay with the loud, can you hear me now?
And my, cold, she a centerfold
Put her on a stand, and she never told

[Hook: Future & Ty Dolla $ign]
Ordered up a hundred rosés, need a Benz like blasé, blasé
Whipping Maserati, I'm just (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Blasé, blasé, blasé
Blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé
Whipping Maserati (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
I break the bank like an athlete, hon
Shawty krunk drunk, fucking up her new Louboutins
If I let her in my Masi she might be a trending topic
Before she gotta ride it, bust it, pop it, blasé, blasé
Been spent your rent and I'm still blowing big faces
Something 'bout them Ben Franklins make any, get naked
Crew got the juice, bitch you don't need no chasers
Ball on these, ball on these, I need knee replacements

[Hook: Future & Ty Dolla $ign]
Ordered up a hundred rosés, need a Benz like blasé, blasé
I'm just, whipping Maserati, I'm just (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Blasé, blasé, blasé
Blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé
Whipping Maserati (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
Sipping out the jug until I feel it in my body
I was, uh, hoping you were salty when you saw me
Keep a rowdy scene around me, all we do is dip and dab
Got twin turbos on twin turbos and them, and them, really smash
It's a 50/50 chance I might ditch ya (ditch ya)

[Outro: Future]
Ordered up a hundred rosés, need a Benz like blasé, blasé
I'm just, whipping Maserati, I'm just (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Blasé, blasé, blasé
Blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé
