[Verse 1: Zara Larsson]
My love (my love) is more potent (more potent)
Than anything in the cup that you're holdin' (you're holdin')
One little taste will have you open
Ayy, I know you want some, you want some (want some)
Too strong (too strong), no limits (no limits)
It's not official, so take your time with it (time with it)
It go straight to your head, control your mind with it (mind with it)

[Pre-Chorus: Zara Larsson]
You know I'm the only one that gets you higher
Gets you higher, babe
And you ain't gotta worry 'cause you know I got it

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
Stuck on it 'cause my love so good
So you, keep comin' back to get some more
Got you in your feelings, all emotional
