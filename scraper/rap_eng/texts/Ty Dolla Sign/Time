[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I remember the day when they put you away
Just gave your life but that ain't no life
So I'm living life for you, fucking all these bitches
Sending you the pictures, each and every city, hesitation rise with this girls every night oh
Everywhere we go
All we know is money, hoes and clothes
Is the life we chose
And loyalty is everything so

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
If they ask me why I do it I'mma tell em that
I do it for my niggas, I do it for my niggas
The ones that couldn't make it, everybody else fake
Do it right, got a lot on your mind, watchin' time pass by
Watchin' time pass by, watchin' time pass by oh yeh yeh

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I remember the time, that I met your son
I know he's on your mind, treat him like he's mine
I'm just living my life, fuckin all these bitches
Sending you the pictures, each and every city, wishing you was with me uhh
Everywhere we go
All we know is money, hoes and clothes
Is the life we chose
Loyalty is everything

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
If they ask me why I do it I'mma tell em that
I do it for my niggas, I do it for my niggas
The ones that couldn't make it, everybody else fake
Do it right, got a lot on your mind, watchin' time pass by
Watchin' time pass by, watchin' time pass by oh yeh yeh

[Verse 3: Joe Moses]
Moment of silence for my people who ain't here but so is
To all my niggas who know what a real goalis
To all my women who know exactly what rose is
Far from my bitch but know exactly what a ho is
Huh, I pray for em just return the blessings
And remember the good things and how granny blesses
And look past all the bad and how the devil test us
And never let the evil wonder off are even stress us

Yeah my little brother is on the wrong path
So as a man I can't judge, I can only ask
We laugh moments and share times till they fade away
For heaven sip my crowds can only ask for the having gates
Mentally I'm scared so believe fall of the bull
My dog got a hundred how the fuck he gonna be cool
Oh no my goons sometimes I act the fool
But pride never foolish so foolish when it's true

Between me and you sure I'm just like you
So when I got caught I look just like you
Regardless to it all I was holding down my crew
But when the judge hit the (?) what should a real man do
Looked just like you and eyes of beholders
Facing all my faults running from the rollest
Bang about the past I had a world never shoulders
Regrets and believes is so big like a bolder

Cutting down the colder, sitting on the block
To the police rolled up and pull out that Glock
Never had the chance in this fucked up life
I pray to god everything alright

[Outro: Joe Moses]
Moment for the silence for the people ain't here
And the people that's not gonna be here next week
And the people we shall miss
Love yall, miss yall
