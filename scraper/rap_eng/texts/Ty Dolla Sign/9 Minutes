Verse
Time has come in 9 minutes we could spend
It right the way in a minute there is  hours to make
Happened wherever you go and no matter
What happened to us
Bridge
World is hours like a time said that the weather is
To fast to changed what I said
Tomorrow and today will be together forever
See what I sea in the water a creature from a beautiful ocean
9 minutes later your going to be late
Chorus
9 minutes in a time to walk on the park it
Will be dark later after you talk
Don't waste your time go home early and
Even it's not safe
Verse
Tell me where you are and stop standing
Right there tonight is the night
Your going to be grounded after you leave
A house for the mean time
Bridge
Right time at the right place together as one
Family not to waste some love
Same time not same place at good chime
Is it right to say it
Chorus
I will fight for you tomorrow but in a
9 minutes way I do for you
To changed the time we count clockwise to
Backwards
