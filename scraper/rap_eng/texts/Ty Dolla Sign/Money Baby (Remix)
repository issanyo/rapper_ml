[Intro: K CAMP]
French Montana, Dolla $ign
From the East to the West, respect that grind
Thought we where done but we still in this bitch
And I go by K CAMP and this is the remix

[Hook: K CAMP]
I like smoking weed, I like getting fly
I like having sex, I like girls who ride
I like my cup full, I like turning up
I like brand new shit so this is what I love to do
I like that money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Gotta have that money baby, money baby, money baby
Thats that shit I like (oh, oh)

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Busting down, Rollie you can tell time on it
Ain't no fuck nigga, watch me style on 'em
Put a hundred on your hat, call you bank head
And you can dock a yacht, on a tank head
Money baby, Teterboro flights to Opa-Locka
Been turning to the max, shout to Wavy Crockett
When they come to the V's gotta car lot
Hit Chinx I need a hundred g's, I'm in Far Rock
Get the two dogs for when I piss her off
Don't get too close, walk around with the pistol loaded
Been getting money like a car (Haaan!)
Coke boys, ten meals on the diner line

[Hook: K CAMP]
I like smoking weed, I like getting fly
I like having sex, I like girls who ride
I like my cup full, I like turning up
I like brand new shit so this is what I love to do
I like that money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Gotta have that money baby, money baby, money baby
Thats that shit I like (oh, oh)

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I like to get my dick sucked while I'm getting high
Make her deep throat, her mouth never get dry
I say "Who pussy is this?", she say "Dolla $ign"
Whose pussy is this? She say "Dolla $ign"
She strippin' still got nine to five
Say that she's mine but that's a lie
These hoes will tell you anything
She want the money and the fame
South Central niggas really don't be loving these hoes
These hoes don't be loving these niggas
Really we all just want the money
Money, money baby, baby, Pusha Ink baby
Said she got blunts, I said "I only smoke papers"
Come kick it with the Taylors, bunch of gang bangers
Pimps and players, young money makers

[Hook: K CAMP]
I like smoking weed, I like getting fly
I like having sex, I like girls who ride
I like my cup full, I like turning up
I like brand new shit so this is what I love to do
I like that money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Gotta have that money baby, money baby, money baby
Thats that shit I like (oh, oh)

[Verse 3: K CAMP]
I like taking niggas hoes but i stopped doing that
Once i hit her with that dick she dont know how to act
Blowing up a niggas phone can you please fall back
Aye lil ho leave me alone i ain't got time for that
I like good weed i like bad bitches that can roll it up
And a rider thats gon hold me down no matter what (stay down)
Sipping good so please dont worry bout whats in my cup (its not yours)
And she on them drugs so yeah you know she down to fuck
Its going down its going down its going down, lil bitch
I'm known to stay one hundred and you counterfeit (I can't fuck with you)
And you ain't with my crew if you ain't tryna get rich (gotta run that up)
And ima dick her down yeah she love that shit

[Hook: K CAMP]
I like smoking weed, I like getting fly
I like having sex, I like girls who ride

I like brand new shit so this is what I love to do
I like that money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Gotta have that money baby, money baby, money baby
Thats that shit I like (oh, oh)
