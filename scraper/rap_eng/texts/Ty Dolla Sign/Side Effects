[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you tried to warn me 'bout the side effects
Side effects, you did
Yeah, you tried to warn me 'bout the side effects
Side effects, you did
Pull me with a head nod, yeah
Put me in a headlock, yeah
Yeah, you tried to warn me 'bout the side effects
Side effects, you did

[Chorus]
Ain't nobody safe now, safe from the side effects, no
(Side, side effects, no)
Safe from the side effects, no

[Bridge]
No preparing for how you do it
Couldn't get my mind right for how you lose it, oh no
My breath ain't been right since you took it
Yeah, my world's been upside down, it's almost like you pull it
You come around and I-I don't wanna eat
Yeah, You come around and I-I don't wanna sleep
You tried to warn me

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you tried to warn me 'bout the side effects
Side effects, you did
Yeah, you tried to warn me 'bout the side effects
Side effects, you did
Pull me with a head nod, yeah
Put me in a headlock, yeah
Yeah, you tried to warn me 'bout the side effects
Side effects, you did

[Chorus]
Ain't nobody safe now, safe from the side effects, no
(Side, side effects, no)
Safe from the side effects, no

[Bridge]
No preparing for how you do it
Couldn't get my mind right for how you lose it, oh no
My breath ain't been right since you took it
Yeah, my world's been upside down, it's almost like you pull it
You come around and I-I don't wanna eat
Yeah, You come around and I-I don't wanna sleep
You tried to warn me

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you tried to warn me 'bout the side effects
Side effects, you did
Yeah, you tried to warn me 'bout the side effects
Side effects, you did
Pull me with a head nod, yeah
Put me in a headlock, yeah
Yeah, you tried to warn me 'bout the side effects
Side effects, you did

[Chorus]
Ain't nobody safe now, safe from the side effects, no
(Side, side effects, no)
Safe from the side effects, no
Ain't nobody safe now, safe from the side effects, no
(Side, side effects, no)
Safe from the side effects, no
Safe from the side effects, no
Safe from the side effects, no
Ain't nobody safe now, safe from the side effects, no
(Side, side effects, no)
Safe from the side effects, no
