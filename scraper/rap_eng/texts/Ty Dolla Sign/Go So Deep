[Verse 1: YG]

Slow dance nigga on this grown man
I'm tryna hit it missionary while we hold hands
Turn your phone off so don't fuck up the program
Then I eat it up while we listening to slow jams
Got her saying oh damn, got her saying oh fuck
Cause I'm hitting all those spots a nigga don't touch
No buts, you don't do shit
I told her baby don't trip just focus
Yeah, a young nigga stroke's so sick
I take it off then slide in then finna ()
Yup, a young nigga make a soldier
I study her body like it's homework
I told her rock me like a chauffeur
But she ain't know how, so I had to show her
There's no limit when I'm in it
How you want it, you gon' get it
And when I finish, I'mma lick it lick it lick it

[Verse: PC]

Umm, I'm so ready and done with the chit-chatter
Wait a little it'll be () and I'm telling them () I key(?)
Down for the calls cause there's nothing that's gon' stop us
Slick talked your panties off breaking you, more proper

Make you come faster, are you crazy with back spasms
Get it how you want it cause baby it don't matter
