[Verse 1: TC Da Loc]
UGH!
Driving real fast down Washington
I'm a Washington nigga, I'm a Washington
I be on my shit you do the opposite
You be talking about the lick and I just hit the bitch
UGH!
Just me and my K be
Fuck once make a bitch go crazy
That...
Mid-Town mula, don't motherfucking come out
Click-clack do ya
I don't want shit, I don't need shit
If I had my hand out then I smacked a bitch
Aye!
Told her get off the floor
Used to getting it fast nigga in and out the door
Niggas is all talk, all square, also
I be pimping these hoes, pimp, pimping these hoes
Stay with three stacks like Andre
Dunk on a nigga like Andre
Smoking big weed everyday
I'm with Ty so he sipping on that Bombay
UGH!
Bad Puerto Rican bitches
But they ain't never get my riches

[Chorus: TC Da Loc]
I take my time and I think
I need about twenty racks in one week
You take your time you always sleep
You ain't got no money broke nigga you cheap
Tell me how you GETTIN' 2 IT
Tell me how you GETTIN' 2 IT

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Pass me the bottle
I'm a take a shot for G.Ca$$o
M-O-B-B that's the motto
Basic ass bitches stay getting none follow
I've been GETTIN' 2 IT all day
Never go broke no way
Fuck pussy long get my head caught on need a bitch getting money like me
Had a...
Real nigga fucked up but I bounce back
Dolla $ign you can count on that
I'm with forty eight hundreds so I bought the Remy
I'm known for putting  on in my city

[Chorus: TC Da Loc]
I take my time and I think
I need about twenty racks in one week
You take your time you always sleep
You ain't got no money broke nigga you cheap
Tell me how you GETTIN' 2 IT
Tell me how you GETTIN' 2 IT

[Verse 3: RJ]
Look...
I pull up
Crack the whole dice game
Bet I hit the point like a sniper aim
Got it out the mud I was O-T
Had a drum way before I had a goatee
OOH!
That's no lie, I promise
Cross my heart and crucify, I'm honest
Talk is talk is for face shots like Botox
When niggas play both sides you check them like Foamposites
No matter how you going to ride it you got it
Get dough [?] drive check the mileage
These niggas feel I'm on they heels off the diamonds
Got rubber bands around these peels in my Robin's
Peelie Gang...
West side "A" hats
Niggas that hop out and do they stuff like A-Wax
Whip yams ASAP, stuff it in A-Jax
Known to keep a four, four and a "K" like A-Rabs
Yea ya!

[Chorus: TC Da Loc]
I take my time and I think
I need about twenty racks in one week
You take your time you always sleep
You ain't got no money broke nigga you cheap
Tell me how you GETTIN' 2 IT
Tell me how you GETTIN' 2 IT
