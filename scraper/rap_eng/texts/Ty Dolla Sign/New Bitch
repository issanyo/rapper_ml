[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Left my bitch cause she ain't no good
I'mma find a new bitch and fuck her real good
I'mma find a new bitch and treat her real good
I'mma do the things that a real man should
Left my bitch cause she ain't no good
I'mma find a new bitch and fuck her real good
We be up in Dover Street market, poppin' tags
Pussy man I stash, I'mma make this shit last

[Verse 1: Hardo & Ty Dolla $ign]
I done found a new bitch, then fuck her real great
Move my diamonds out the way, now bitch look me in the face
She addicted to the girl, told her scrape the whole plate
She been high for 4 days, only go on coke dates
Tell a bitch to tell her bitch, her ice my wrist, been taking risks
And I been flexin', got her pissed, cuz my new bitch be on her shit
I'mma blow a lil cheese with some crackers at the Ritz
I'mma drop my whole top, but she gon' show 'em both tits
And they know a nigga flexin', I been droppin' real swag
Swerved on my baby mama, made her real mad
Swerved on a po-po, run a red light
She know trappin Hardo there if the head right

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Left my bitch cause she ain't no good

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Make that shit last, don't ride it too fast
Love it when you look back when I hit it from the back
Love it when I pull off in that turbo real fast
Swerved on my baby mama, made her real mad
Swerved on a po-po, run a red light
She know Dolla $ign, there if they head right
She know when she gon' she be on my mind
I be po'ed up, she be fuckin' with the white
Hella gone, hella gone, Bombay, marijuana
Celine and Belenciaga, this somebody daughter
Hella good, hella good, she gon' be a better love
I ain't goin' back now, I ain't comin' back now

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]

[Outro: Hardo]
