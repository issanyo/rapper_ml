Why you so shy
I get the guap
I get a lot
Got it on lock
Fire my Glock
Fire the Glock
Put up the snot
Pull up the lot

Why you so shy
I get the guap
I get a lot
Got it on lock
Fire my Glock
Fire the Glock
Put up the snot
Pull up the lot


Rappers pretend who you not
Put your bitch ass in a box
See shoes on your Reebooks or Adidas  or what ever you rock
We killing man we forgot
All this money on me is the shirt shop after you start thinking about hamicalibers and the aftermaths or what Dr. Dre would put out
Hammerspray, handgranade you should stand away. I`ma let the Taliban activate
I can put you on WorldStar nigga, that is only just a cam away
Stomach movement I still grab a plate
Money come to me, bitches gravetate
Make me more cares then a rabbitscase and my throat freeze like I`m shy to say
Shy to say
Shy to say
I got a question did you have a feeling you´d die today
A silencer, silencer, pillow over the barrel just to shut up and bust shot a spray
It´s not a game, gotta play, got a nigga rubbing elbows with the hall of fame
A problem for Dolla it got me custemizing bullets nigga, let me write your name
Brah Brah


Why you so shy
I get the guap
I get a lot
Got it on lock
Fire my Glock
Fire the Glock
Put up the snot
Pull up the lot

Why you so shy
I get the guap
I get a lot
Got it on lock
Fire my Glock
Fire the Glock
Put up the snot
Pull up the lot

Nigga be talking a lot
Baby and everything we would pull up on the block
I lost the top when I drop just so you niggas can see me pull up at your thot
I let the b give me top
She told me Dolla I like when you finger the box
I let the B hold the Glock
I got my F and its loaded and ready to pop
Enemys gotta pay hit them with the gage
Fuck the police and the NRA
Walk in this bitch with rage
Shoot up the club and this bullets ain´t got a name
I did that nigga like kang the mini society way
Kill a man, kill a man I got a question did you have a feeling you´d die today?
Bandana with the draco
