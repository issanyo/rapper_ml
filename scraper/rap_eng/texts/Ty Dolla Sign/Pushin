[Verse 1: Chanel West Coast and Ty Dolla $ign]
Like-Like-Like-Like-Like-Like-Like-Like-Like bath salts
Going crazy shut it down in this 'B', like last call
Never catch me bounce on them, baby, like basketball
Do what I wanna, smoke hella marijuana, It ain't my fault
Stay showin' off, if you got it then flaunt it, just let them know
Moving to the music, go hard just lose it, with no remorse
I'ma keep cruisin' like Tom in a movie, just stuntin' off
Hate it or they love it, always cold at the summit, got a Hermès scarf
They so sick, it is what it is, just call it off

[Chorus - Chanel West Coast]
Never gave a fuck about no hater ’cause they ain't put me on
Never gave a fuck about no hater ’cause they ain't put me on
Never gave a fuck about no hater ’cause they ain't put me on
This for my fellas and my ladies, get money all day long
Pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), keep it pushin’
Pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), keep it pushin’
Pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), keep it pushin’
Pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), keep it pushin’

[Verse 2 - Ty Dolla $ign]
(Dolla's, Dolla's, Dolla's) Sign
Girl-g-g-girl you gettin' money, then you’re bout your dollar signs
Got you rolling papers, now we gettin' high
You gone off the Yager, I'm on Miller Lite
Your ex seen me but you got him bitter, right?
We smoking, toking, choking, we don’t give no fucks
Tint on her window, getting ratchet in the truck
Everything we rough is on designer
If I fuck with you then you design all
Every car I drive is a foreign
Switch them bitches up, she get boring
Mister T-Shirt with Versace and some Jordans
Put my middle finger up, tell them...

[Chorus - Chanel West Coast]
Never gave a fuck about no hater ’cause they ain't put me on
Never gave a fuck about no hater ’cause they ain't put me on
Never gave a fuck about no hater ’cause they ain't put me on
This for my fellas and my ladies, get money all day long
Pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), keep it pushin’
Pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), keep it pushin’
Pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), keep it pushin’
Pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), keep it pushin’

[Verse 3 - Chanel West Coast]
I’ma keep it pushin', like a fire in the club
Haters shush them, yeah we shut em up
You peep my styles, checking out my butt
Might not be Nicki, but I got enough (okay, okay)
I’m a go hard-go hard, Rihanna style
Do it all night-all night, make it worth my while
All these doubters-doubters, can suck a dick
Like powder-powder, they gon' fiend for me
Wanna talk about us, let 'em talk
We stacking money, hotel on Boardwalk
Ain’t nothing funny, like small talk
May act lil' gully like I’m from New York

[Chorus - Chanel West Coast]
Never gave a fuck about no hater ’cause they ain't put me on
Never gave a fuck about no hater ’cause they ain't put me on
Never gave a fuck about no hater ’cause they ain't put me on
This for my fellas and my ladies, get money all day long
Pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), keep it pushin’
Pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), keep it pushin’
Pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), keep it pushin’
Pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), pushin’ (pushin'), keep it pushin’
