[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign & Angel Gold]
No na na na na
Yeah yeah Yeah yeah

Na na na na na na na
Dolla.. Dolla $ign

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
These niggas is fake
These bitches is fake
Don't know who to trust (Goddamn)
I've been riding around strapped up
Yeah I'm still paranoid
Same nigga calling you bro
Same nigga get at your hoe
I've been out here getting rich and you niggas still broke

[Verse 2: Angel Gold]
Can you do me a favour
Don't ask me for nothing
No hand outs and no life savers
What you sayin?
[?] when you in my coat
Switchin' lanes
Beep beep beep beep
Get out my way
I'm talkin' to you
I give road rage when I'm coming through

[Pre-Chorus: Angel Gold]
When I'm coming over don't ask me to dance [?] No no
We're not taking pictures
We're not taking nothin'
I wanna know somethin' 'bout you
Okay okay Alright alright
Let's hear somethin' new
I'm crushin' my check
Cause zeroes and commas
Don't ask me for nada no no

[Chrous: Angel Gold]
In case you're unsure
I'm not impressed
People takin' advantage, let's put that to rest
Don't ask me for favours, no way
Don't ask me for nada
Don't ask me for favours, no way
Don't ask me for nada
No no no no
No no no no

[Verse 3: Angel Gold]
Can you stay out my buisness
My [?] can't talk to too many, only a few
Whatchu thinking, fly to LA for the few
Shopping spree, ching ching ching ching, pockets is loaded
Music so loud, sound like a helicopter when I'm comin' through

[Pre-Chorus: Angel Gold]
When I'm comin' over, don't ask me to dance [?] No no
We're not taking pictures
We're not taking nothin'
I wanna know somethin' 'bout you
Okay okay Alright alright
Let's hear somethin' new
I'm workin' now
It's the PM the AM don't ask me for nada, No no

[Chrous: Angel Gold]
In case you're unsure
I'm not impressed
People takin' advantage, let's put that to rest
Don't ask me for favours, no way
Don't ask me for nada
Don't ask me for favours, no way
Don't ask me for nada
No no no no
No no no no

[Verse 4: TeeCee4800]
Uh ay
Ridin' 'round the city in a coupe (uh)
Everything that i drive bullet proof (facts)
I be by myself, trustin' niggas is bad for your health (forreal)
But they wanna switch up so fast
So you gotta watch out for these no niggas (Yah)
All they wanna do is count your pockets, tell em' get back
Stop!

[Outro: Big TC]
Listen... you can't trust nothin'
People out here straight leeches
They try to slither they way in and manipulate the situation, any way they can
Tryna' take advantage, they don't wanna do nothin' for they self
They don't wanna strive for nothin'
Alsalamu alaikum

[Chorus: Big TC & Angel Gold]
In case you're unsure
I'm not impressed
People takin' advantage, let's put that to rest
Don't ask me for favours, no way
Don't ask me for nada
Don't ask me for favours, no way
Don't ask me for nada
No no no no (No no no no)
No no no no
