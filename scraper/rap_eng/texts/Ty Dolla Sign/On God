[Intro]
(DP on the beat)
(Now rockin' with 10 Deep)
Ooh
Dolla Sign
(Go Deep)
Oh no, no, no, no
No, no

[Chorus]
Yeah, like, on God
Don't do me no favors, rather get it in my own
I got all the love in the city, on God
I got all the money and the women, on God

[Verse 1]
Dreads real it ain't no extension, on God
Dolla who the killas bangin' on em for, yeah
Dolla got the Barry Bonds earring, boy you extra
Dolla got the Lenny Kravitz nose, when you rasta
Dolla made a milli last year on tour
Dolla met up Bobby last year on tour
Dolla flew in on a jet, boy you extra
Dolla want the top, not the sex
Boy you rockstar

[Bridge]
Bombay with the lemon, ahh
Rolling look at me, ahh
Bad bitch sittin' pretty, ahh
After party litty, ahh

[Chorus]
Yeah, like, on God
Don't do me no favors, rather get it in my own
I got all the love in the city, on God
I got all the money and the women, on God
Yeah, like, on God
Don't do me no favors, rather get it in my own
I got all the love in the city, on God
I got all the money and the women, on God

[Verse 2]
Drunken in the mirror like, I know I need Jesus
Made a goofy pay me five bandz, for my Yeezy's
Boy you better stay up out my business, on God
My Black Card, ain't got no limits, on God
My Porsche, got two hundred twenty on the dash
My girl, said Dolla buy me a CÃ©line bag
Maison Margiela, but I'd rather rock the Vans
My OG, just did a bid for contraband
Dolla fly his women out private, boy you extra
DP beat on the beat, got me wildin', boy you rockstar
Violate a nigga on site, no question
We be up in Synn's and A-O-D, straight flexin'

[Bridge]
Bombay with the lemon, ahh
Rolling look at me, ahh
Bad bitch sittin' pretty, ahh
After party litty, ah

[Chorus]
Yeah, like, on God
Don't do me no favors, rather get it in my own
I got all the love in the city, on God
I got all the money and the women, on God
Yeah, like, on God
Don't do me no favors, rather get it in my own
I got all the love in the city, on God
I got all the money and the women, on God
