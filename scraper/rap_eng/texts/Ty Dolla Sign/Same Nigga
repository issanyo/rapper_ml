[Hook]
Before I had dough I still look like this
And before I had dough I still take your bitch
'fore I had dough I still was with the same niggas
Now that I got dough, it's still the same niggas
Said money, cars, money and cars
Clothes, the hoes, oooh oooooh ohhhhh
I'm stil the same nigga
I'm still the same nigga

[Verse]
I got some money everybody wants some
Where the fuck did all these new niggas come from
Bro hit me, he behind them prison walls though
Would you guard on my package and store it up
Momma saying "why don't you call your brother"
Daddy saying "why don't you call your brother"
Ain't that a mothafucker, you know we all love ya
Ain't nothing new under the sun
I'm still the same OG (same OG)
Nigga don't get it fucked up (don't get it fucked up)
You could still get fucked up (fucked yeah)

[Hook]
Before I had dough I still look like this
And before I had dough I still take your bitch
'fore I had dough I still was with the same niggas
Now that I got dough, it's still the same niggas
Said money, cars, money and cars
Clothes, the hoes, oooh ooooooh ohhhhh
I'm still the same nigga
I'm still the same nigga
