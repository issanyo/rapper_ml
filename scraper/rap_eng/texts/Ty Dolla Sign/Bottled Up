[Intro: Dinah Jane]
Dinah Jane

[Verse 1: Dinah Jane]
I don't need no diamond ring, baby, I got you
I can buy the finer things, simple things will do
Say the best things in life are free, now I know why
Since you gave your love to me, opened up my eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Dinah Jane]
I'm a bad chick, I need a bad one with me
Work from home, but he gon' stay up with me
No sleep tonight, yeah, you know what I like
If you ride for me, I'm gonna ride for you
Back to back, boy, we gon' make it through
No sleep tonight, yeah, you know what I like (woo)

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
I'm drinking, baby, 'cause I'm bottled up
I'm smoking, baby, yeah, I'm high as fuck
I'm drinking, baby, 'cause I'm bottled up
I'm smoking, baby, yeah, I'm high as fuck

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla $ign
Bottled up, yeah, yeah
Bottled up, yeah
Feeling like Bee & Jay, we're drunk in love, yeah
I put 50 on your wrist, that don't mean shit
When you tell me that you're mine, I know you mean it
D'Uss√©, put it on the rocks
Little baby, on that french Vanilla Ciroc (ooh, yeah)
We could be anywhere in the world right now
But you're here with me, girl (oh, woah)

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy, Dinah Jane & both]
I'm drinking, baby, 'cause I'm bottled up (baby, I got you, ooh)
I'm smoking, baby, yeah, I'm high as fuck (simple things will do)
I'm drinking, baby, 'cause I'm bottled up
I'm smoking baby, yeah, I'm high as fuck

[Verse 3: Dinah Jane]
I know that sex appeal is all they sell
I could get it with a one night stand, but it won't be real
But he putting in the work
Let me feel if this is worth it
Gonna have to hit him with the bust down
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Dinah Jane]
I'm a bad chick, I need a bad one with me
Work from home, but he gon' stay up with me
No sleep tonight, yeah, you know what I like
If you ride for me, I'm gonna ride for you
Back to back, boy, we gon' make it through
No sleep tonight, yeah, you know what I like (yeah)

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy, Dinah Jane & both]
I'm drinking, baby, 'cause I'm bottled up (I'm bottled up, yeah, yeah)
I'm smoking, baby, yeah, I'm high as fuck (I'm high as fuck)
I'm drinking, baby, 'cause I'm bottled up (been drinking, oh)
I'm smoking baby, yeah, I'm high as fuck (yeah)
Baby, I'm bottled up, yeah
Baby, I'm bottled up
Baby, I'm bottled up, yeah
