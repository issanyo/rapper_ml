Girl, Imma spend a lot of money tonight
Anything to get that body to wind

Don't worry bout your problems, we got till sun up

[Verse 1: E-40]
We came for the girls, boody and curves
Ass and tits, thick ass hips
Drunker than a motherfucker, high as a kite
Strawberry cush, Tequila and Spright
Came in with my Cig, snuck in with my stick
What you mean a stick, extended clip
Who you in here with, my hyenas and pimps
You finna start some shit, I'm tryna knock me a bitch
Richard Mill watches, not a Swotch or a Quoral
If I wanted to, every week, I could buy me a forin
Her dude hella boring, she say he lazy and fake
All they do is gosep on the phone, and he hate
The homies from the soyal call him Tin Man, cause he ain't got no heart
No bite, no bark
My pockets is bloated, got all my paper and Euros
The haters know it, we came here for the girls
Bitch!
