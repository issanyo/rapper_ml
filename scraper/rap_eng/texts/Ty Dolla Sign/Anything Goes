[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Hey
You tha baddest in your city I'm the realest in my city
All my home boys rich all your home girls pretty
Pull up, all doors up in that Lamborghini
Wish I could fuck em all
Just playing but anything goes
When you a fine little bitch
And she bad like this
Anything goes
With a nigga this rich
And it shine like this
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
When the diamonds on your wrist
And the engine sounds like this
And you drive slow just so they can see you
Girl when you got ass like that
And a pretty ass face just to match
Imma fly you out just to see you
You like to go shopping
I like it when you're topless
I'm being serious but anything goes
Girl you already
And when I say anything, anything goes, anything

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
You baddest in the city I'm the trillest in the set
Yeah
All we ever do is smoke weed take shots and have sex
I pull up on Forgis in that Maserati
Said you had to go to work but you still gave me top
Yeah
You know I like that type of shit
I know you like that new Saleen
These hoes so jealous of you and me
What about the passion got up on her shoulder right now
Right now
She probably don't know I know you lonely too
Mmmm, Oh my god, I guess anything goes

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
When that Rollie on your wrist
And your engine sounds like this
And you drive slow just so they can see you
Girl when you got ass like that
And a pretty ass face just to match
I'm fly you out just to see you
You like to go shopping
I like it when you're topless
Let me be serious but anything goes
Girl you already
And when I say anything, anything

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Pull up in that time machine
Ain't shit I would change though
I could buy your whole life
And still have me some change though
I'm just serious
Cause I'm, tired of playing with nigga's
Anything goes if you try me nigga
I throw a check boy I'm talking 8 figures
I put a pool on a jet
I save her number as elevator cause that shit went down when we met
Cause anything goes
Behind closed door
Legs in the air, clothes on the floor
Shit I love when I meet a girl just like me
Cause anything goes
When the bitches look like twins
But they say they're just best friends
Then you know damn well they both want you
Bout a hundred bottles of that Henny
And you've had one too many
And that IHOP is the only thing left to do
Girl what you gonna order
Cause I know my order
You hurry her no particular order
Anything goes
If it wasn't for the finest cars and all the things I got
They would say no, they would say no
And nigga that's real talk
That's why I'm quick to tell these hoes walk
You've had one, you've had them all
Till she came along
And she just changed my mind
Cause I love her demeanor
Man I knew when I see her
I fuck around put a ring on that finger
Anything goes
When I'm feeling crazy
Might just fly you to Haiti
Might go half on a baby
You never know
Anything goes

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
When the diamonds on your wrist
And the engine sound like this
And you drive slow just so they can see you
Girl when you got ass like that
And a pretty ass face just to match
I'm fly you out just to see you
You like to go shopping
I like it when you're topless
I'm being serious but anything goes
Girl you already
