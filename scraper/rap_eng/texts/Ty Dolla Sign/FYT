[Intro: French Montana]
Hitmaka
Right Now Sound
Montana!

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Sittin', my diamonds glisten (Bling)
I don't talk, I listen (Listen)
I learn new things, fuck the cool thing (Skrrt)
Too much drama for my momma (Momma!)
Never put your love in dollars (Dollars)
Me and Puff poppin' collars, rest in peace to Wallace
Baby, Junior M.A.F.I.A
We the hottest, that's the obvious
French vanilla bottle
Hundred mil a convo
On my neck, the lotto
Global express to Cabo (Skrtt, skrrt, skrtt)
Ty!

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
We gon' give you anything, diamond rings
I can bring, tuh
And I put you on the team, that should mean that
I'm fucking you tonight
Ooh, yeah
I'm fucking you tonight, Ooh, yeah

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Make decisions, I wanna play with your permission
Gimme that kitty, girl, wash the dishes
Now spread them legs, call it long division
That pussy taste like
Woah, woah
I hit it like woah-oah-oah-oah (Woah)
I kiss it like ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Ooh)
Don't stop, I need more (More)

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Every time I pull away
Something keeps on telling me to stay
I can't keep these memories off my head
So babe

[Chorus: Jeremih & Ty Dolla $ign]
He don't give you anything, diamond rings
I can bring tuh
And I put you on a team, that should mean that
I'm fucking you tonight
I'm fucking you tonight, night, tonight
He don't give you everything, diamond rings
I could bring tuh
If I put you on a team, that should mean that
I'm fuckin' you tonight, ooh yeah
I'm fuckin' you tonight, tonight

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
I might get a room for you tonight
Maybe we can champagne cheers tonight
Make you swallow all of your fears tonight
How you gone let them hoes tell you what you like
I'm in Neiman Marcus throwing tantrums
You think you know high fashion
Just to take it off, babe
Let's see you run your mouth when I take it down, down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Every time I pull away, yeah yeah
Something keeps on telling me to stay
I can't keep these memories out my head
So babe

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Jeremih]
He don't give you anything, diamond rings
I can bring tuh
And I put you on a team, that should mean that
I'm fucking you tonight (Bring a friend and another one)
I'm fucking you tonight, oh yeah, ooh yeah
He don't give you everything, diamond rings
I could bring tuh
If I put you on a team, that should mean that
I'm fucking you tonight, ooh yeah (Bring a friend and another one)
I'm fucking you tonight, tonight

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign & Jeremih]
I might end up with you
Kissin', touchin', fuckin' (Bring a friend and another one)
Girl, your body's calling for me
I'm fuckin' you tonight
I'm fuckin' you tonight
Wooaah-ooh-woah
