[Intro]
Right Now Sound
I be with the Hitmaka

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Knew when I copped that brand new coupe you'd be right side of me
Couldn’t let you walk past since the first time you say hi to me
Say you can't trust these niggas no more, can you try for me?
I hold you down, no talking down, girl, just don't lie to me
I got your back, all I want back is just don’t lie to me
I don't need much, just need your trust, and a lil more honesty
I hit you up, ask what you want, girl, just don't lie to me
Not tryna complain, girl, all I'm saying's just don't lie to me

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
You know, I know, when you be lying eye to eye with me
I hold you down when he ain't there, I know you ride for me
4 A.M I'm by myself, girl, would you fly for me?
Then wake up, take you shopping, probably spend a lottery
Is you down for a nigga? Girl, it’s now or never
And my section make the news, how I change the weather
At the party, you want something, know I’m down with that
Said she born to ride a dick, then I'm a Crown Vic

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Told that nigga what it was, and he nodded
Just copped some Saint Laurents I can’t fit my knot in
Tryna make you smile, see that blush in you
Let's, work on this trust, girl, I got trust issues, yeah

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Knew when I copped that brand new coupe you'd be right side of me
Couldn't let you walk past since the first time you say hi to me
Say you can’t trust these niggas no more, can you try for me?
I hold you down, no talking down, girl, just don't lie to me
I got your back, all I want back is just don't lie to me
I don't need much, just need your trust, and a lil more honesty
I hit you up, ask what you want, girl, just don't lie to me
Not tryna complain, girl, all I'm saying's just don't lie to me

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Good girl, lil bad something, I'ma spend some racks on you
Make it only tax on 'em, know I like it hands on
You know I'm a real professor, babe, let me teach you a lesson
I'm young and I'm handsome, I'm the man, and then some
Where your man? Girl, would you fly to me, fly to me, fly to me?
Rodeo girl, gonna ride on me, ride on me, ride on me
You know you probably getting more than him out of me
I don't know why you would lie to me

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jeremih]
Told that nigga what it was, and he nodded
Just copped some Balmains that I can't fit my knot in
Tryna make you smile, see that blush in you
Let's, work on this trust, no, I got trust issues, yeah

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Knew when I copped that brand new coupe you'd be right side of me
Couldn't let you walk past since the first time you say hi to me
Say you can't trust these niggas no more, can you try for me?
I hold you down, no talking down, girl, just don't lie to me
I got your back, all I want back is just don't lie to me
I don't need much, just need your trust, and a lil more honesty
I hit you up, ask what you want, girl, just don't lie to me
Not tryna complain, girl, all I'm saying's just don't lie to me
