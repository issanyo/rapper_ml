[Intro: Verse Simmonds]
You know what time it is
Legendary
And I brought some of my friends with me
Like they here, here go, huh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Faces in my pillow case
Mascara on my sheets
She shake it for the money
She shake it like a freak, oh
Only for me, me, me, oh
Tonight, only for me, me, me
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight, tonight

[Verse 1: Verse Simmonds]
Told her, you ain't gotta tell no lies, girl, you ain't gotta tell no lies
I don't wanna be the one who judge you, baby, it's your life
I ain't gon' gas you up, girl but that ass on fire
And I know you got a man, but fuck that nigga tonight (uh-huh)
All these niggas tryna holla
I ain't tryna waste your time, tryna bother
I just wanna come through, do you got friends?
I ain't tryna press you, do you got plans?
Room 112 at the Four Seasons
Left the key downstairs, get it on your way in
She said, "I ain't got no panties on"
You know how many we meet with no panties on?

[Pre-Chorus: Verse Simmonds & Ty Dolla $ign]
And that night I'm going through the same thing
She know I ain't looking for a main thing
And she gon' do whatever for a real one
I switch 'em up, just like a chameleon, hey

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ty Dolla $ign]
Faces in my pillow case
Mascara on my sheets
She shake it for the money
She shake it like a freak, oh
Only for me, me, me, oh
Tonight, only for me, me, me (me yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight, tonight (yeah)

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
You smell that girl perfume on my pillow
I said, "Don't worry 'bout it", ain't got nothing to do with us
I knew as soon I hit it more than once
I gave you the wrong impression, still haven't learnt my lesson
That love is gooder as a motherfucker, girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, I got you sprung and I'm up, aw yeah
Yeah, yeah, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Verse Simmonds]
And that night I'm going through the same thing
She know I ain't looking for a main thing
And she gon' do whatever for a real one (let's switch 'em up)
I switch 'em up, just like a chameleon, hey

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Verse Simmonds]
Faces in my pillow case (all of these faces)
Mascara on my sheets, sheets (oh, oh, ooh)
She shake it for the money
She shake it like a freak, oh (oh, girl)
Only for me, me, me, oh (just me, me, me, oh, woah, yeah, yeah)
Tonight, only for me, me, me (all me, all mine, tonight your mine, yeah, yeah, girl)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight, tonight (yeah)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
You see my phone ringing when I'm asleep
You know it's them other girls, that come around you all the time
And you can't believe that it's your best friend
And you say, "How could you cheat with them hoes?" Woah
I should have been, told her, I had a couple of her friends over
We started drinking, I wish I would have stayed sober
We started dancing, they started pulling
Straight to the bed, then we started fucking, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Verse Simmonds, Ty Dolla $ign]
And that night I'm going through the same thing (same thing)
She know I ain't looking for a main thing (ooh, oh, oh)
And she gon' do whatever for a real one (real one)
I switch 'em up, just like a chameleon (yeah, hey, oh)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Faces in my pillow case (yeah)
Mascara on my sheets (oh, oh)
She shake it for the money
She shake it like a freak, oh (oh, girl)
Only for me, me, me, oh
Tonight, only for me, me (only for me)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (only for me)
Tonight, tonight

[Bridge: Verse Simmonds]
Yeah, only for me
Verse, for me, Ty, for me, Breezy
Hey, only for me
This goes out to all the girls, for me, hey, yeah
She gon' drop that ass only for me (woo)
She gon' pop that pussy only for me (woo)
Yeah, yeah, dance, dance, dance do it only for me, do it (do it)
Dance, dance, dance do it only for me, huh (do it)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Faces in my pillow case
Mascara on my sheets
She shake it for the money
She shake it like a freak, oh
Only for me, me, me, oh
Tonight, only for me, me, me
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight, tonight
