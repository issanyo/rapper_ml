[Intro]
You know a little

[Verse 1: THEY.]
Things don't add up (Add up)
Guess it goes that way for the both us
Girls talk just don't matter
'Cause they say that shit just to hold you up
You took it for granted, I will never ever take advantage
Don't be so quick to take a gamble if you can't take the damage
You made me complacent
How the fuck you gon' tell me 'bout patience?
Every time I think we got it handled
Then we end up fighting 'bout the same shit

[Chorus: THEY.]
Don't you know we too grown up to be doing this shit right now?
Don't you know we came too far to be losing our trust right now?
It's been eighteen months, you should what's up right now?
We've been through way too much to be fucking up right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Girl it's been eighteen)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Girl it's been eighteen)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Girl it's been eighteen)

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla $ign
You need more (More) attention (Ooh yeah)
You know I'm busy but (But) you've been missing me too much (Ooh yeah)
So much to talk about, sitting on this couch, but the silence too loud
Miss me with the run around let me know by now
(Let me know by now)
You took it for granted, I will never ever take advantage
Don't be so quick to take a gamble if you can't take the damage
You made me a believer, I said "I'll never leave ya"
Every time I think we back solid
Gone to the same old problems, yeah

[Chorus: THEY.]
Don't you know we too grown up to be doing this shit right now?
Don't you know we came too far to be losing our trust right now?
It's been eighteen months, you should what's up right now?
We've been through way too much to be fucking up right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Eighteen months)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Eighteen months)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Eighteen months)
