"Who this?"
"Your rich bitch"

[Intro: Rick Ross]
This is for my rich bitches
Her puppy named Panamera
Her puppy named Panamera
She got a condo in the area
Rich bitch, uh, yeah

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
She stay at her friend's and all these bitches is bad
Watch them lick on each other, I'm talkin' pussy to ass
Dope boy still at large, trackin' device on their car
Tattoos on her arm, Double M diamond charms
Chanel bag on her hip, Herm√®s bracelets and things
Let her fuck Meek Mill, told her keep chasin' her dreams
Get the Lexus to flip, purple Texas to sip
She make it rain like a nigga, we got more money to get
Rich bitch, call her rich bitch
Cause she fuck with dope boys and can suck a good dick

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Yeah, I'm a spend up all this money (facts, facts, facts)
Girl, you doin' somethin' to me (facts, facts)
Hell yeah, keep doin' that, doin' that
Keep doin' that, doin' that, ohh, oh yeah
Keep doin' that, doin' that, keep doin' that, doin' that

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
I be feastin' on Tinder, she taste just like peaches
Diamond-studded La Perla, that pussy's prestigious
Yeah, she remind me of somethin' but that shit ain't my Jeep
Matchin' Bugattis, Versace sheets when we freak
She be movin' that dough, quarter mil on her wrist
Why you niggas be slippin'? This bitch is fuckin' your bitch
Saks Fifth, pop tags, Neiman Mar', pop tags
Crocodile, python, that's a zoo on her bag
She on the phone makin' deals, we gettin' them checks
My Penelope Cruz, I let her meet my connects
I fuck her all on the marble, yeah, that girl is a freak
She like cummin' n' money, she's the female me

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Yeah, I'm a spend up all this money (facts, facts, facts)
Girl, you doin' somethin' to me (facts, facts)
Hell yeah, keep doin' that, doin' that
Keep doin' that, doin' that, ohh, oh yeah
Keep doin' that, doin' that, keep doin' that, doin' that

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Room service for weeks, a Dusit towel on the beach
She only wear panties once, then pass it down to her niece
Let's go shoppin' at Boca, sixty stuffed in the sofa
Can't be tweetin' locations, she postin' pics from her yoga
Never party with locals, niggas with them Boost Mobiles
VIP with dope boys, the DJ shout out to Sosa
Valet parkin' the Wraith, cocaine all on her face
Her Rolex icy as mine, throw up my gang sign
We goin' bottle for bottle, Belaire Rose to the Brut
Rich bitch is her name and she Chanel to the boot
Uh, I be droppin' so much, nigga
My bitch shoppin' so much, nigga

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Yeah, I'm a spend up all this money (facts, facts, facts)
Girl, you doin' somethin' to me (facts, facts)
Hell yeah, keep doin' that, doin' that
Keep doin' that, doin' that, ohh, oh yeah
Keep doin' that, doin' that, keep doin' that, doin' that
