[Verse 1]
We were so dumb in love
Couldn't get enough, no
But I could've loved you so much better
And I can't believe you never walked out

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's not your fault

[Chorus]
That I fumbled your heart
Should've let go of my past for you
You did everything I asked of you
Drive across the country if I asked you to
But I'm just bad for you
I fumbled your heart
I'm bad news, yeah I'm just bad for you
I'm bad news, I fumbled your heart

[Verse 2]
Girl, you used to feel so bound in my arms
I wish we could touch some more, it's eating me alive
I'm sitting, working on this letter, I wanna put my feelings down
The first line I write, I was wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's not your fault
It's so wrong, it's so wrong, it's so wrong

[Chorus]
That I fumbled your heart
Should've let go of my past for you
You did everything I asked of you
Drive across the country if I asked you to
But I'm just bad for you
I fumbled your heart
I'm bad news, yeah I'm just bad for you
I'm bad news, I fumbled your heart

[Bridge]
It's all or nothing if you're my all or nothing
Well all of you are nothing, I'm sorry that I messed up girl
Really love you, really really love you, and now that I know I love you
I'll never love another girl and it's not your fault, no

[Chorus]
That I fumbled your heart
Should've let go of my past for you
You did everything I asked of you
Drive across the country if I asked you to, ever asked you to, I'm just bad for you
I fumbled your heart

[Outro]
She said I ain't gon' change
Ever since the day we met
And her mama said the same
I dropped the ball I'm so ashamed
I'm bad news, real bad news, I fumbled your heart
