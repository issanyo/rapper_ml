[Post-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Did some numbers then I went back to the vault (to the vault)
Did some numbers then I went back in and fought (yah, yah)
Did some numbers then I went back like the GOAT (skrrt, skrrt)
Did some numbers then I went and copped a Porsche (ooh, yeah)

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Did some numbers then I went and copped a 911
Did some numbers then I went and copped my bitch a necklace
Then some corner shawty told me "Boy stop drivin' reckless"
Got my side bitch, she keep textin', I ain't get the message
I stopped fuckin' ratchet hoes, they be too messy
Kickin' bitches out like Barcelona, shoutout Messi
Better Black or Mexi, Texi, but she too sexy
Double latex when we sexin', shit be too risky
I got a lot, I don't act, I musta flied with the pack
Fuck on my bitch from the back, yeah, she like that
I'ma let you, tell her we never gon' lose

My white girl in love with the coke

[Chorus: Future]
I brought them bottles on bottles

[Post-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Did some numbers then I went back to the vault (to the vault)
Did some numbers then I went back in and fought (ooh, yeah )
Did some numbers then I went back like the GOAT (like the GOAT)
Did some numbers then I went and copped a Porsche (mm, mm)

[Verse 2: Future]
Did some numbers then I went and copped a Porsche

[Chorus: Future]
I brought them bottles on bottles
