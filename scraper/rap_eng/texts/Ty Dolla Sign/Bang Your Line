[Guitar Solo] Xeryus
[Verse 1: Elhae]
On Time, flight 5602
I done traveled all day, had a long afternoon
Can't wait to see your face when I pull up on you
You was talking all the things you gon' do
Can I come over?
Can I come over?
You look just like Aaliyah with your hair falling over
Your left eye
Crazy, sexy, cool, baby you the truth
Set the house on fire if you want to
Fall in your love and I stand in it
I need to go, but I'm staying in it
All in your body, I hit your wall
Step in that bitch, and I set it off (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Elhae]
I let you ride it long as you want to
Never tell me what you won't do
You gon' try it if I want to
Yea, you know I'll be there when I get back in town every time

[Chorus: Elhae & Ty Dolla $ign]
You know I'll bang your line
You know I'll bang your line
You know I'll bang your line

[Verse 2: Elhae]
She came first, I came last
Roll the grass
Baby I ain't like them niggas that you ever had
Let me see you pose for the photograph
You was showing all your goods tryna be bad
She's falling off the mattress
Showtime like an actress
Baby you the baddes, yeah
And I swear every time I come into the city pulling up
And you know you wanna ride up on it baby, saddle up
And you know that i'm that nigga, even when you got a nigga
One phone call, then I'm right back with ya (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Elhae]
I let you ride it long as you want to
Never tell me what you won't do
You gon' try it if I want to
Yea, you know I'll be there when I get back in town every time

[Chorus: Elhae & Ty Dolla $ign]
You know I'll bang your line
You know I'll bang your line
You know I'll bang your line

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Came through with your girl, she a third wheel
She was tryna go, we did our thang still
You was getting loud, you know the walls thin
You told me go deeper, put it all in
Knowing damn well you can't take it
Got you making ugly ass faces
You said my dick is amazing

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign & Elhae]
I let you ride it long as you want to
Never tell me what you won't do
You gon' try it if I want to
You know I'll be there when I get back in town every time

[Chorus: Elhae & Ty Dolla $ign]
You know I'll bang your line
You know I'll bang your line
You know I'll bang your line

[Outro: Elhae]
Bang, Bang, Bang your line. I'm gon' hit you everytime. I gon' show up everytime
You gon' get yours everytime
