[Intro: King Los]
King
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Chorus: King Los & Ty Dolla Sign]
We ain't trippin' cause them lames, can't fade us
Mind your business, get your change, can't fade us
Nah, nah, they can't fade us
You can't fade us

[Verse 1: King Los]
Hold up, um, I whip a two to an eighth
I fuck the one not the two, stick a few in the safe
I'm slippin' through the Wraith
Can't get this shoe in a states
Nigga, you're in the way, your bitch a two in the face
I rock yellow gold, fuck hella hoes
Rock Maison Martin Margiela clothes
I tell a ho like I'm sellin' O's
Look, once I bag it I let it go
I floss up with the top off, I boss up like the top office
This bitch hop off of ya knockoffs
We make movies, no box office
I slide off with a brunette, wake up with a few blondes
My hoes do Louboutins, your hoes do futons
Ride with no roof on
If I hit, my man hit like we buy hoes on Groupons
Let me fuck you to my new song

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
I'm a beat it 'til I break it, beat it 'til I break it, woah ('til I break it)
If that thing fat, go on, shake it ho (go on, shake it ho)
Beat it 'til I break it, beat it 'til I break it, woah ('til I break it)
If that thing fat, go on, shake it ho

[Chorus: King Los & Ty Dolla Sign]
We ain't trippin' cause them lames, can't fade us
Mind your business, get your change, can't fade us
Nah, nah, they can't fade us
You can't fade us

[Post-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
They can't fade us, can't fade us

[Verse 2: King Los]
I don't scoop a hoochie, unless she got a floosie wit' her too
They'll Daffy Ducky you to come and get Goofy with the crew
Naw, my shoe ain't Gucci, but I'm Gucci with the shoe
Yeah, there's bodies in my trunk and my roof be in it too
I got nine hustles I'm tryin' to juggle to make the profit double
You try to jungle, I'll hit your head, do my time humble
Squad tight, they talk white like Bryant Gumbel
Count the money, no time to duffle
I paper bag it, drop the top, I paper tag it
Got a new Glock and I'm laser taggin'
I made it happen like two blondes, woke up with a brunette
My favorite things; new shoes, new sex, new checks
We all got on V-necks, but you should do the crew next
Ooh, yes, give me head first like a suplex
Cause I just wanna

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
I'm a beat it 'til I break it, beat it 'til I break it, woah ('til I break it)
If that thing fat, go on, shake it ho (go on shake it)
Beat it 'til I break it, beat it 'til I break it, woah ('til I break it)
If that thing fat, go on, shake it ho

[Chorus: King Los & Ty Dolla Sign]
We ain't trippin' cause them lames, can't fade us
Mind your business, get your change, can't fade us
Nah, nah, they can't fade us
You can't fade us

[Post-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
They can't fade us, can't fade us (oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla Sign]
Beat it 'til I break it, beat it 'til I break it, woah ('til I break it)
If that thing fat, go on, shake it ho (go on, shake it ho)
You ain't camera shy, take a picture, trick (take a picture, trick)
I'm just tryin' to come through a visit when you ain't busy
You got your homegirls, I got my homeboys wit' me
We them boys from the city, yeah, I run my city
And when I come to your hood, I got some real ones with me
Yeah, I've been grindin' all day and night
Tryin' to make sure I get it right (oh yeah)
Get her tight, make it go "good night"
Eh, put her out, candle light
Can't fade us, can't fade us
Nah, nah they can't fade us
Can't fade us

[Outro: Ty Dolla Sign & King Los]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
They can't fade us, can't fade us (oh yeah)
Yeah yeah
I'm a beat it 'til I break it, beat it 'til I break it, woah ('til I break it)
If that thing fat, go on, shake it ho (go on, shake it ho)
Beat it 'til I break it, beat it 'til I break it, woah ('til I break it)
If that thing fat, go on, shake it ho
We ain't trippin' cause them lames
Mind your business, get your change
