[Verse 1: Nasri]
Saturday morning jumped out of bed and put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet, all the way to you
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand
To ask you a question
Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Hook: Nasri]
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life? say yes, say yes
Cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is no!

[Hook: Magic!]
Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway
Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
Marry that girl
Yeah, no matter what you say
Marry that girl
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so rude

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Why you gotta be so rude? (so rude)
Such a lady but you act like a fool
I’m feeling on your bad ass, but don’t get on your bad side
Backlash the Patron, too many shots done backfired
Now I ain’t ever saying sip slow but you gotta know
When them other bitches flirting, girl, I been so rude
I been so rude, don’t look so confused
It’s you that I choose, ah

[Pre-Hook: Magic!]
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life? say yes, say yes
Cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is no!

[Hook: Magic!]
Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway
Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
Marry that girl
Yeah, no matter what you say
Marry that girl
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so rude

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Why you gotta be so damn bad girl?
Why you gotta have so much ass girl?
Ay, I’mma let you lick the rapper
I like it when you tell me “faster, faster”
I give you all of me, give me all of you
Show me what it do (what it do)
Ay, I’mma rock that boat (that boat)
Row, row, row (row, row, row)
Then I gotta go (then I gotta go)
Hey (sorry)
