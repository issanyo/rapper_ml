[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Pretty mind, silk thoughts
Start a fire when you turn the lights off
Oh my, my God
When he made you, he did a fine job

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I know you been hoping I'd give in
But I ain't feeling that feeling, no
Yeah, you right, maybe I'm trippin'
The one thing I love more than being with you and that's

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Late nights, doing what I wanna do
I got sleep eyes; I woke up like this
Feelin' like, aw man, throw some bacon on it
One thing I love more than being with you
And that's no ties, no drama in my life
Yeah I, I woke up like this
Feelin' like, aw man, throw some bacon on it
One thing I love more than being with you-ou-ou-ou
Aye, you-ou-ou-ou
Aye, you-ou-ou

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Sizzling, white hot
Give me that sugar with the sweet talk
You're perfect, but I'm not
So how do we end up in the worst spot?

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I know you been hoping I'd give in
But I ain't feeling that feeling, no
Yeah, you right, maybe I'm trippin'
The one thing I love more than being with you and that's

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Late nights, doing what I wanna do
I got sleep eyes; I woke up like this
Feelin' like, aw man, throw some bacon on it
One thing I love more than being with you
And that's no ties, no drama in my life
Yeah I, I woke up like this
Feelin' like, aw man, throw some bacon on it
One thing I love more than being with you-ou-ou-ou
Aye, you-ou-ou-ou
Aye

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign
Girl every time we get together, it's a movie
You on top, got me feeling on your booty
Don't you hate it when you know there's other girls around
Won't admit it, but you're acting so different now
And it's hard to just let go like that
When you been with a broad, and you go way back
And you love what keeps you coming back
And I love when a bad bitch down my back

[Nick Jonas]
The one thing I love more than being with you

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Late nights, doing what I wanna do
I got sleep eyes; I woke up like this
Feelin' like, aw man, throw some bacon on it
One thing I love more than being with you
And that's no ties, no drama in my life
Yeah I, I woke up like this
Feelin' like, aw man, throw some bacon on it
One thing I love more than being with you-ou-ou-ou
Aye, you-ou-ou-ou
