Dolla $ign!

[Hook]
I could take yo bitch whenever
All my cars got wood & leather
All I fuck with is 9's and 10's
If she ain’t got no ass, she got some titties

[Verse 1]
Got that whoop tatted on me, Imma whoop
I don’t need no bodyguard, Imma shoot
Got some money in the cut like I’m Jewish
You ain’t got no money, homie, then you useless
These niggas hatin on us, these hoes choose us
Every time you see me I’m with a new one
Every time you see me, you never do nothing
I fucked your bitch in the trap on the futon
I got a New York bitch, she out of Brooklyn
I gave her that dope dick and now she hooked on
She was a good girl so I brought her back
Soon as she fucked up I call the dollar cab

[Hook]
I could take yo bitch whenever
All my cars got wood & leather
All I fuck with is 9's and 10's
If she ain’t got no ass, she got some titties
I could take yo bitch whenever
All my cars got wood & leather
All I fuck with is 9's and 10's
If she ain’t got no ass, she got some titties

[Verse 2]
Bitch I’m on another level
I got my mind made up, I’ll never settle
All my bitches bad, ain’t nothing special
And if yo bitch out of line, she don’t respect you
When I pull up on yo block, I’m on business
When she with me, she ain’t thinking bout commitment
Said she ain’t been with a real one in a minute
I had her in the kitchen water whippin
These niggas tryin' they hardest, you niggas still poor
Hundred bottles at Liv that’s what we live for
I’m rocking chains and watches that you got robbed for
You got a team of niggas ain’t on they job though
My lil' bitch from LA stay in the A town
Move that pack on that Greyhound she stay down
Every day I expect the same designer
If you don’t know homie, let me remind ya

[Hook]
I could take yo bitch whenever
All my cars got wood & leather
All I fuck with is 9's and 10's
If she ain’t got no ass, she got some titties
I could take yo bitch whenever
All my cars got wood & leather
All I fuck with is 9's and 10's
If she ain’t got no ass, she got some titties
