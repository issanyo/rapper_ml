[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign & Eric Bellinger]
Dolla $ign
This gon' be your favorite song

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Even though I can't come home to you (Even though I can't go home)
Girl you know that I'll do ya (You know I'll do ya)
Oh, girl you know that I
I'll do ya, I-I'll do ya (x4)

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla, Dolla $ign (x2)
I'll do you
Put you on yo back and give it to you
I like my sprite real muddy
I like it when my asian girl sucky sucky
I used to fuck my ex-bitch without a condom
Glad I left that bitch before I caught sum'n
All my bitches bad, all my bitches ratchet
Industry hoes, fuck 'em when we pass 'em
All she want is Dolla $ign
And I don't eat it if she not a dime
She do it 4 a young and that's not a lie
And we be fuckin' on some spotify

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign & (Adrian Marcel)]
Even though I can't come home to you (Even though I can't go home)
Girl you know that I'll do ya (You know I'll do ya girl)
Oh, girl you know that I
I'll do ya, I-I'll do ya (x4)

[Verse 2: Adrian Marcel]
It's obvious I can't lie
Girl you super thick and know you hella fine
I'mma beat it one time (yea, yea)
But we ain't catching feelings cause you ain't mine
But you're like
Can I do ya? (I-I do ya)
Lickin' on your body have you screamin' "Hallelujah"
Panties all soakin', now you're turnt up
Baby, surfs up
No need for questions, you know why you here
Girl let that body talk, just tell me how you feel
Say I got that fou-fou, well I got that real
You know you wit it, so you know the deal

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign & (Eric Bellinger)]
Even though I can't come home to you (Even though I can't go home)
Girl you know that I'll do ya (You know I'll do ya)
Oh, girl you know that I
I'll do ya, I-I'll do ya
I'll do ya, I-I'll do ya (I'll do it to you baby)
I'll do ya, I-I'll do ya (Oh yeah yeah)
I'll do ya, I-I'll do ya

[Verse 3: Eric Bellinger]
You ain't lookin' for the love (girl if you ain't lookin')
You just tryna have a good time (girl if you ain't lookin')
And you promise to delete all your messages
Leaving no evidence behind (baby we could do it)
You could come with me, yea
We could do it at the same (baby we could do it)
You know I can't be your man, but we'll do it again if you act right (act right, woah)

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign & (Eric Bellinger)]
Even though I can't come home to you (I can't) (Even though I can't go home)
Girl you know that I'll do ya (I'll do ya baby) (You know I'll do ya)
Oh, girl you know that I
I'll do ya, I-I'll do ya (I'll do ya to you, girl)
I'll do ya, I-I'll do ya (I'll do ya to you, girl)
I'll do ya, I-I'll do ya (I'll do ya to you, girl)
I'll do ya, I-I'll do ya (Yeah)
