[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
What a night, uh
What's the price, uh
I just ran up on a check
And caught a flight, ayy
What a night, ayy
Twice is nice, ayy
I just ran up on a check
And caught a flight, mhm

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
You like my ice, I'm drippin' water
We the wave, uh, twenty-four dollars
She in love with Dolla, shawty call me papa
Say I hit it proper, she screamin' like the opera
She in love with Dolla, shawty call me papa
Say I fuck her proper, she screamin' like the opera
I put her back in rotation, I put her back in rotation
I told her, "Swallow my kids"
She told me, "Goin' off this"

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
What a night, uh
What's the price, uh
I just ran up on a check
And caught a flight, ayy
What a night, ayy
Twice is nice, ayy
I just ran up on a check
And caught a flight, mhm

[Verse 2: 24hrs]
I know she like me, fancy Nikes
She said, "Twenty, make a movie, call him Spike Lee"
She said, "Slow down, you too cocky"
I just bust down all this ice like this shit hockey
Girl, I cannot play around
You love it when I lay down
An' you ain't gotta push me
You know I stand up in that pussy, know I stand up in that pussy

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
What a night, uh
What's the price, uh
I just ran up on a check
And caught a flight, ayy
What a night, ayy
Twice is nice, ayy
I just ran up on a check
And caught a flight, mhm

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
What a night, uh
What's the price, uh
I just ran up on a check
And caught a flight, ayy
What a night, ayy
Twice is nice, ayy
I just ran up on a check
And caught a flight, mhm
What a night, uh
What's the price, uh
I just ran up on a check
And caught a flight, ayy
What a night, ayy
Twice is nice, ayy
I just ran up on a check
And caught a flight, mhm
