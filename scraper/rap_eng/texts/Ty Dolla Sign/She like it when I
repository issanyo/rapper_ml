[Hook]
I guess she like it when I tell her the truth
I can't be your man but I can be your boo
I guess she like me cause I don't lead her on
Right after I hit I tell her that I gota go
I guess she like it when I, I
I guess she like it when I, I
Guess she like it when I
Guess she like it when I
I guess she like me cause I, cause I look good

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
She don't fuck with squares only niggas from the Hinood
She like me cause I, cause I'm rich
She like me even more cause she know I got bitch
Guess she like me cause I dick her down proper
Make her call me poppa, she screaming like the opera
Whoa Kimosabe, big balling is my hobby
Got bitches in the lobby, that's my type of party
Fast like Ferrari, I only hit it doggie
She got a nice body like she do Pilates
All my bitches love me, all my bitches love me
She got another nigga but she don't put him before me

[Bride: Ty Dolla $Ign]
Bitches ain't shit, hoes ain't shit, niggas ain't shit, a bitch gone be a bitch
They use the word love to get pussy
I just hit it once and keep it pushing

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tee Flii]
She like that I keep her on a creeze
Her baby daddy can't put it down like me
Got her sprung on the D
Hell yeah, she reppin "Team Annie", see
I'm weak bitch, fuck we weak niggas
My back filled up my cup got Patrone in it
I like them Annie's with the bizzy bodies
Got a whole lot of ass and can get naughty
Back it up, look back at it, throw it at me
Girl, get ratchet, girl
You only live once, girl, get bout it
I need 40 spins you gone make it clap
