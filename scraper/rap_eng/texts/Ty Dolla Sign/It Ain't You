[Intro- Jordin]
Where my ladies at?
Where my ladies at?

[Mustard on the beat hoe]

[Hook- Jordin]
Dude swear he a boss (he a boss)
Still living with his moms' (with his moms')
Stay fresh though! (Fresh though)
And you wonder why it ain't you?
Ooh, ooh
Why it ain't you?
Oooh, ooh, oh

[Verse 1- Jordin]
This one is for all my ladies
All these fellas in the songs talkin' crazy

More than loyal, I'm royal, and you can bet
I look better than I do on the Internet
Take a step back cause I'm too fresh
Need a pack of gum doodoo breath (eww!)
You're not an O.G, you're an OMG
You can say hi but don't touch me!
Already know who I wanna talk to
Got my eye on him when I walk through
Yeah, we came here to party
And I ain't trying to see your fucking car keys
A little too smart for you babe
May look pretty, but I got a brain
Need a pause, here's some Twix
Hope it keeps you busy, boy, I really over it cause

[Hook- Jordin]
Dude swear he a boss (he a boss)
Still living with his moms' (with his moms')
Stay fresh though! (Fresh though!)
And you wonder why it ain't you?
Ooh, ooh
Why it ain't you?
Oooh, ooh, oh

[Verse 2- Jordin]
Ain't enough a couple shots
My type you are not
So many girls up in here, why me?
You already done flop, Y pree
Got curves, like my curls
Couldn't get with me, now you try my girl
Please!  Did your mama helped you to get dressed?
BOY, SAY IT WIT YO' CHEST!
Say VIP is where I gotta be
Cause I can't get people up off of me
Acting all drunk like you wanna fight
But you've been sipping on the same drink the whole night
Stepping up like a jerk
Who in the world told you that shit would work?
I am the fliest boss girl up in this skirt
Me and my ladies run this thing you heard!

[Hook- Jordin]
Dude swear he a boss (he a boss)
Still living with his moms' (with his moms')
Stay fresh though! (Fresh though)
And you wonder why it ain't you?
Ooh, ooh
Why it ain't you?
Oooh, ooh, oh

[Bridge- Jordin]
You wonder why it ain't you?
You didn't even know what to do
Ooh, why, why, why, why, why, why
Straight fair
I'm a win
You're an air

[Hook- Jordin]
Dude swear he a boss (he a boss)
Still living with his moms' (with his moms')
Stay fresh though! (Fresh though!)
And you wonder why it ain't you?
Ooh, ooh
Why it ain't you?
Oooh, ooh, oh
Yeah, yeah

[Outro- Jordin]
This one is for all my ladies
All these fellas in the songs talkin' crazy
This one is for all my ladies
All these fellas in the songs talkin' crazy
And that's it
