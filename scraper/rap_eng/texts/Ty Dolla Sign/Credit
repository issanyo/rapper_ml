Oh yeah
Aah yeah
Oooo  aaaa aaaah

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Now I stopped talking to them bitches
I did everything you asked to me and more (oh oh oh oh)
Still you be going through my 'gram
Trippin' when you know them pictures old (oh yeah)
I'm more than focused on this money
Trying to turn this house into a home
Swear you stay focused on the problems
Girl it ain't no wonder they ain't gone

[Pre-Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
So I say I don't care, you say I ain't there
So I should just pack my shit and go
I grab myself a bag, you beg me to come back
Why must you play them games with your nigga, I'm so tired of it
Now you can't make your mind up if you want a nigga
I hate to see you lonely like these other bitches
You bringing up the past when you know it's different
And you know I'm different, I'm just saying girl

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Just give a nigga some credit, where credit is due
Just give a nigga some credit
Just give a nigga some credit, where credit is due
Just give a nigga some credit
I said give a nigga some credit, where credit is due
Just give a nigga some credit
Just give a nigga some credit, where credit is due
Just give a nigga some credit
Just give a nigga some credit, where credit is due

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I ain't never flirt with none of your home girls
I could give a fuck about your home girls
I never smoked weed in your mama house
Unless you sparked that shit, she was out of town
I promise to go to the grave with all your secrets
And whatever gifts I bought you, you can keep it
Girl, as strong as I am you're my weakness
And after a long day at work, you're like a weekend

[Pre-Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
So I say I don't care, you say I ain't there
So I should just pack my shit and go
I grab myself a bag, you beg me to come back
Why must you play these games with your nigga, girl
Now you can't make your mind up if you want a nigga
I hate to see you lonely like these other bitches
You bringing up the past when you know it's different
And you know I'm different, I'm just saying girl

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Just give a nigga some credit, where credit is due
Just give a nigga some credit
Just give a nigga some credit, where credit is due
Just give a nigga some credit
I said give a nigga some credit, where credit is due
Just give a nigga some credit
Just give a nigga some credit, where credit is due
(oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Where credit is
Where credit is (yeah, aaaah yeah)

[Verse 3: Sevyn Streeter]
Baby I done forgot about it
I be sitting around and just thinking about it
You do everything you say you gon' do
Want you to know I appreciate all that shit
Even when we be arguin'
Still come before everybody
Ain't no ifs, ands or buts about it
Because what we got here wouldn't trade for nothin'
If you gotta go, be good to your man
Because I know you're good for it
I know you good for it, do what you should for it
I know your good for it
Nigga you are the good kid, and that's how it should be
I know you're good for it

[Outro]
[Ty $]
So on lock down what, like ain't no weed smokin' or what?
[TC]
Ain't no coming out of the show, ain't no nothin', you feel me. Like we ain't ran a shower in a week. We ain't got no food, nothin', it's bad right now
[Ty $]
No food?
[TC]
Nothing, they don't let you go to the store, they donâ€™t let you get packages, they don't let you do nothing. You just gotta live off the state, stay in your cage and work out. We got muscles though, we got muscles though, still got muscles. Yeah last year, that's regular shit man, like same shit
[Ty $]
Yeah....
[TC]
