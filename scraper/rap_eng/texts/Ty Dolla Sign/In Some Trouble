[Intro: Korporate]
Hold tight
I got somebody for ya'
I'm finna hit shorty right now!
She badder than Bebe's kids, ya hear me?
And she be sliding and gliding

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
I sent a flight out your way
Lemme know if you got it
Take you out to the islands
Maybe somewhere exotic
Shawty backing it up, she dancing like she at Follies
She be sliding, and gliding
She got drip on her body

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
We ain't got time for the lames
We tryna live in the moment
Flower girl you the coldest
Chop the top off the Lotus
Bank account on no limit
Cause we so bout it, bout it
She be sliding, and gliding
She got drip on her body

[Post-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl them niggas can't love you like I love you
You gon' fuck around and get me in some trouble
Give you the business, baby let's go public
Girl them niggas can't love you like I love you
I said, he ain't gonna love you like I love you
We got bottles coming over by the dozen
I'm a business, baby let's go public
I'ma fuck around and get you in some trouble

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
She got a nigga at home, talking 'bout she a savage
She just dropped me an address, talking 'bout I can have it
Off-White on the heels, with the stripes on the bottom
She be sliding, and gliding, she got drip on her body
She get wet like Hawaii, got that flow outta water
Back and forth 'cross the border
Louis V like a hoarder
She got baggage I told her, "Girl we all got some mileage"
But we just don't care, we just keep it player
Put a lil' something in the air
Smoking that kush on La Brea
Looking like Princess Leia, lick my, Lightsaber
I've been way up since Straight Up
Timbuk2 on the fader
OutKast in high school we was bumping "Hey Ya"
Now I'm on a whole new wave I feel like Kelly Slater
Up in the condo, fucking on the elevator
Or we can keep it low-key take it off the radar
Just put the filler up in the grill, I see you in Jamaica

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
I sent a flight out your way
Lemme know if you got it
Take you out to the tropics
Maybe somewhere exotic
Shawty backing it up, she dancing like she at Follies
She be sliding, and gliding
She got drip on her body

[Post-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl, them niggas can't love you like I love you
You gon' fuck around and get me in some trouble
Give you the business, baby, let's go public
Girl, them niggas can't love you like I love you
I said, he ain't gonna love you like I love you
We got bottles coming over by the dozen
I'm a business, baby, let's go public
I'ma fuck around and get you in some trouble

[Refrain: Vic Mensa]
If you feel, is it love? (Is it love?)
Is it lust? (Is it lust?)
Do you (Do you?)
Touch yourself sometimes?
Would resist, but never was
When was it ever love?

[Outro: Vic Mensa]
She be sliding, and gliding, she got drip on her body
Slide, sliding, and gliding, she got drip on her body
Shawty backing it up, shawty backing it up
She be sliding, and gliding
Drip, drip on her body
