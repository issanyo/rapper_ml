[Hook: Victoria Monet]
Our love was made in China
In a glass house on a hill by the winding road
Our love was made in China
When you came back from the garden with a silver rose
Made in China
Made love in China
Love is made in China

[Verse 1: Victoria Monet]
Your love is king to me baby
Finest of fabrics, amazing
But you've been breaking me lately
And I try fixing it daily

[Pre-Hook: Victoria Monet]
Picking up stones, taking it slow
Dreaming of peace on a pillow
Longevity's what we were made for
Remember baby

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Victoria Monet]
Undone and twisted, oh baby
Tarnished and weak when it's raining
We don't belong to this hate thing
It's foreign to fight when we should be

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
My love was made in L.A
She give me brain on the 110 freeway
Yeah she bad but she do what I say
Woah, now she reppin' Taylor Gang
Smoking weed now I look like I'm from China
She like it when I put my tongue on her vag (na na na na na na)
Oh, then I hit her with my one two (one two)
She never tell me what she won't do

[Hook]
