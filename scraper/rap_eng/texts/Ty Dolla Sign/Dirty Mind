[Intro: Stanaj]
This could only go two ways
Being with you or thinkin' 'bout being with you
And I can't explain it
Laying next to someone new
Thinkin' 'bout you or thinkin' 'bout being with you
I wonder, do you see through?
The way that I look at you

[Verse 1: Stanaj]
Do you know where my head goes
I don't wanna let is show
But if I'm being honest with myself
I gotta say

[Chorus: Stanaj]
This could only go two ways
Being with you or thinkin' 'bout being with you
And I can't explain it
Laying next to someone new
Thinkin' 'bout you or thinkin' 'bout being with you
'Cause it don't get no better
You know it, I know it
This could only go two ways
I'm with you or with you in my dirty mind

[Post-Chorus: Stanaj]
I'm with you, oh
Or with you in my dirty mind
I'm with you, yeah
I'm with you in my dirty mind

[Verse 2: Stanaj]
I'm with you, you're takin' control
Doin' things that I thought were impossible
You're the leading role in my best scenes
The star of my wet dreams
And if I'm being honest with myself
I gotta say

[Chorus: Stanaj]
This could only go two ways
Being with you or thinkin' 'bout being with you
And I can't explain it (Yeah, girl)
Laying next to someone new
Thinkin' 'bout you or thinkin' 'bout being with you
'Cause it don't get no better
You know it, I know it
This could only go two ways
I'm with you or with you in my dirty mind

[Post-Chorus: Stanaj]
I'm with you, oh
Or with you in my dirty mind
I'm with you, yeah
I'm with you in my dirty mind

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Still with you in my dirty mind
She just with me 'cause I'm Dolla $ign
You played yourself once, baby girl
Don't you play yourself a second time (Woah)
Thinkin' 'bout us
Boolin' in my room, laid up
Thinkin' maybe we shoulda just made up
Hey, I swear that you fuck me better
When we breakup and get back together

[Chorus 2: Stanaj & Ty Dolla $ign]
Being with you or thinkin' 'bout being with you
And I can't explain it
Laying next to someone new
Thinkin' 'bout you or thinkin' 'bout being with you
'Cause it don't get no better
You know it, I know it
This could only go two ways
I'm with you or with you in my dirty mind

[Outro: Stanaj & Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm with you
Or with you in my dirty mind
I'm with you, yeah
I'm with you in my dirty mind
I'm with you
I'm with you in my dirty mind
I'm with you in my dirty mind
