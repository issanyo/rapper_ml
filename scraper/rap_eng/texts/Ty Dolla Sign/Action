[Intro: Nef The Pharaoh & Eric Bellinger]
Yeah, you pay attention, say, "Yeah"
This gon' be your favorite song

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
God put a angel in front of me
Swear you could be what you wanna be
Sneakers instead of the heels, yeah
Way that you move is appealing
I hear you claim that niggas ain't shit
Sorry, I'm not who you came with
The party was fun while it lasted
But now you're just ready for action, oh, no

[Verse 1: Nef The Pharaoh]
Super focused on your rear, you don't even notice a nigga is here
You're not looking for love and it's clear
I noticed it's something you fear
Never put you under pressure, take a fall and I'mma catch you
Give you blessing after blessing
People never see the big picture, but I always get the message
Seeing one and I'mma check it
Uber driver driving reckless, sip something, we in Texas
If she get high, then start stressing
I put some marks on her necklace
Mark will even out the check-ins, put some money in her jackets
Do it cause it's unexpected, a real bitch gon' respect it
You'll never ever get neglected
I pay attention, you know I love it when you're natural
You tell me you don't look good
Seeing yourself is seeing your way out
I had a crush for a long time, but today I'm telling you while we face-to-face
And I don't care about no nigga and she had a young face
I bet he ain't had shit on my ass
I'm not another, I'm a lover that can last
I wanna fuck you 'til the next nigga mad
Everything you do is beautiful, you, you and I love it
I done travelled the world and seen millions of girls, but I swear these bitches mean nothing

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
God put a angel in front of me
Swear you could be what you wanna be
Sneakers instead of the heels, yeah
Way that you move is appealing
I hear you claim that niggas ain't shit
Sorry, I'm not who you came with
The party was fun while it lasted
But now you're just ready for action, oh no

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Say you're ready, ready for a real nigga
That a real nigga, here to say your ex wasn't ready
I'm ready for a real bitch, said he too childish
Oh, baby, will you let me take it down
In the driveway in the back of your big truck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, mess that shit up
Backseat, hell yeah, fuck that shit up
Say you ain't even looking for love
You get your own, you ain't want for none
Bad bitch, no you more than that
Average, no you never that
Horny, girl, you always that

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
God put a angel in front of me
Swear you could be what you wanna be
Sneakers instead of the heels, yeah
Way that you move is appealing
I hear you claim that niggas ain't shit
Sorry, I'm not who you came with
The party was fun while it lasted
But now you're just ready for action, oh no

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
You gon' be my super freak tonight
Ain't nobody made you act this way
Press record, we got a movie now
DJ, keep this shit on replay

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
God put a angel in front of me
Swear you could be what you wanna be
Sneakers instead of the Heels, yeah
Way that you move is appealing
I hear you claim that niggas ain't shit
Sorry, I'm not who you came with
The party was fun while it lasted
But now you're just ready for action, oh no

[Outro: Eric Bellinger]
Ready for action, ready, ready for more
Ready to go to the Benz, see what I got in store for you
Ready for, ready for me to be all up on top of your body 'til you get excited
And you don't want me to stop, but you want me to get bored
Keep on going, you know that I won't stop
Once girl I get going, you know that I won't stop
I won't stop, you know that I won't stop
Look at you, ready for action
