[Intro: Quavo]
Just for tonight, oh
Just for tonight, woo

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Quavo]
I want you, you want me
Just for tonight
Just for tonight
I want you baby (You)
And you want me (Me)
Just for tonight, a one night
One night (One night, one night)
(Yo)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Look at my charm and baby look at my arm (look at it)
You know you the bomb, I'mma call you Saddam (boom)
I don't need your phone number, you coming home
You don't really speak no English baby, where is you from?
Never mind that, hop up in my coupe and let the top back
Just a night to remember, get your recorder and rewind that
I'm surrounded by bad bitches, baby you the finest
Don't worry about it, it just me and you on Quavo Island
First night, I was styling, I saw you smiling
When I leave the club on four door, I let you be pilot
When I get you to the room you know that I'mma dive in (splash)
On the first night, lil mama going in

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Quavo]
I want you, you want me
Just for tonight
Just for tonight
I want you baby (You)
And you want me (Me)
Just for tonight, a one night
One night (One night, one night)

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Peeled off in the ride
Big budget like a movie
Keep your bitch by your side
‘Cause them hoes be choosey
Show her the time of her life
You should already know it
These girls quick to lie
That’s why you can’t trust these hoes
She told me she want me
And you call her, you’re only
Plus she fucked the homie
And she ride like a pony
She don’t want commitment
She up in the club
She just want a baller
To show her some love

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Quavo]
I want you, you want me
Just for tonight
Just for tonight
I want you baby (You)
And you want me (Me)
Just for tonight, a one night
One night (One night, one night)

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
Stop playin' while I'm chasin' you, baby
Don't you know I'm tryna bust a move, baby?
Brought my game, leave it at the zoo, baby
Zoovier show you what it do, baby
No games, I'm on sight with you, ay
Get you a coupe with a missin' roof, ay
All the things I'ma do to you, ay
Get you a bag just to hold the tool, ay
And you just fell in love with a goon, baby
Christian Louboutin have you walkin' slow, baby
And I know you see the way they look at you, baby
I get one for me, I get one for you, baby
Bitches gonna hate cause...

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Quavo]
I want you, you want me
Just for tonight
Just for tonight
I want you baby (You)
And you want me (Me)
Just for tonight, a one night
One night (One night, one night)
I want you, you want me
Just for tonight
Just for tonight
I want you baby (You)
And you want me (Me)
Just for tonight, a one night
One night (One night, one night)
(Yo)
