[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Last week I fucked 5 bitches, don't remember one name
She wanna know more, I want one thing
Had her drinking and smoking on the tour bus
Last year I remember they ignored us
She used to fuck with A$AP
Too $hort said he know the bitch from way back
These groupie hoes ain't got no morals
Where that pussy goes only lord knows

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Only lord knows, lord knows
How'd I make it out of nothing, only lord knows
Why these niggas stay fronting, only lord knows
Oooh lord knows, lord knows
Is you really who you say only lord knows
Why they so fake, only lord knows

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Giving hoes game, real shit they gon' remember
I tried to see the Mustang, it don't drop 'til December
And that's what they told me, pussy don't control me
Money don't define me, it help these hoes find me
I wonder if she wanna smoke and sit in the jacuzzi
And can I trust you to make my orange & carrot smoothie
And would you get mad if I looked at a girl booty? (Uh)
I just wanna know, I just wanna know (look)
Get the rag top, hit the drug spot, buy a sack
Then hit the club, who was that? Where you find her at?
Bad little motherfucker, met her up at Starbucks
Or maybe that was Coffee Bean, shit, I was starstruck
I really don't remember

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Only lord knows, lord knows
How'd I make it out of nothing, only lord knows
Why these niggas stay fronting, only lord knows
Oooh lord knows, lord knows
Is you really who you say only lord knows
Why they so fake, only lord knows

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Shawty asked you my name, baby, I'm the Boss
Shawty gave me that pussy, she mad I told my dogs
Never question my people, you see, they roll with me
Don't matter paper no swisher, my niggas smoke with me
Crack house flow, I got a mean buzz
Mai tai's looking how we dress our rings up
Ain't no love for no nigga that's going uphill
What's real? Ghostwrite another book deal (book deal)
Text, call hoes, Facebook up in the city
Nicky Barnes taking selfies, why you standing wit' 'em?
Whole squad getting checks, you'll never know that feeling
All my niggas tatted on me - worth a hundred million
Never tit for tat, I'd rather send the tank
You on breaking news, when I break the bank
When I break the bank, when I break the bank
When I break the bank, when I break the bank

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Only lord knows, lord knows
How'd I make it out of nothing, only lord knows
Why these niggas stay fronting, only lord knows
Oooh lord knows, lord knows
Is you really who you say only lord knows
Why they so fake, only lord knows
