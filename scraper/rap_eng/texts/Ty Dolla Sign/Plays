[Intro]
Sign, Dolla Sign

[Hook]
Every time I pull up
She say all she smellin' marijuana
She say she got drank and some homegirls
Yeah, you know I'm comin' over
We been making plays
Making plays
We been making plays
Ohh, making plays, ohh

[Verse 1]
Till she pay my light I'll be onto it
Told my other girl I was gonna wait
When I pull up we gon' get that
We don't waste no time, we get straight to it
I'ma get her to the room, get her all alone, break her off somethin' special
Don't you move girl, don't you run from it, feel it all in your stomach
I ain't gotta like your ex-man girl, you ain't never got away
Always 100

[Hook]
She know every time I'm gonna pull up
She say all she smellin' marijuana
She say she got drank and some homegirls
Yeah, you know I'm comin' over
We been making plays
Making plays
We been making plays
Ohh, making plays, ohh

[Bridge]
Till she pay my light I'll be onto it
Told my other girl I was gonna wait
(Comin' over)
Till she pay my light I'll be onto it
Told my other girl I was gonna wait
(Comin' over)

[Outro]
We been making plays
Making plays
We been making plays
Ohh, making plays, ohh
Till she pay my light I'll be onto it
Told my other girl I was gonna wait
When I pull up we gon' get that
We don't waste no time, we get straight to it
Making plays
We been making plays
Ohh, making plays
We been making plays
Making plays, plays
Making plays, plays
Till she pay my light I'll be onto it
