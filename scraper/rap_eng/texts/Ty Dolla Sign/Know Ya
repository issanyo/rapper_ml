[Verse 1 : Ty Dolla $ign]
I was stroking, in the morning
When my other bitch came thru unexpected
She was tripping, I was naked
I didn't answer the door she kept banging
I was high on the molly (High)
I wasn't even prepared for the drama (Drama)
She grabbed her heels and her robe
She stashed that bag and crept up out the backdoor

[Hook : Ty Dolla $ign]
I didn't even get to know ya
I didn't ev-, I didn't, I didn't even get to know ya
I didn't ev-, I didn't, I didn't even get to know ya
I did-I didn't get to know ya
I didn't get to know ya
I didn't get to know ya
I  didn't get to know ya

[Verse 2 : Trey Songz]
Ain't this a bitch
Ain't this some shit
Bangin' on the door, I'm on the floor bangin' her ribs
What's your name? Forgot to ask her
This generation hella backwards
I didn't get to know ya, but you gave me that ass first
Tell me beat it like a master
Damn I'm mad at her
She just little obsessed I guess
I'm just a little bit stressed I guess
I can't believe it's real right now
Imagine how she feel right now
She dipped out so quick, ya so pissed off
I'm like hol' up

[Pre-Hook : Ty Dolla $ign]
Didn’t we just meet last night
Girl I don't even really know ya
But nigga got you coming Northside
Nah you fucking, goddamn I didn't even get to know ya

[Hook : Ty Dolla $ign & Trey Songz]
I didn't ev-, I didn't, I didn't even get to know ya
I didn't ev-, I didn't, I didn't even get to know ya
I did-I didn't get to know ya
I didn't get to know ya
I didn't get to know ya
I didn't get to know you

[Bridge : Ty Dolla $ign & Trey Songz]
Look what we done started
Look what we done started
I didn't even, I ain't get to know ya (get to know you)
You ain't going for it
No, no, no, no, I call you forward it
Say you movin' on (Say that you movin')
Say don't call no more

[Hook : Ty Dolla $ign & Trey Songz]
I didn't ev-, I didn't, I didn't even get to know ya
I didn't ev-, I didn't, I didn't even get to know ya
I did-I didn't get to know ya
I didn't get to know ya
I didn't get to know ya
I didn't get to know ya
