I met her in the club
Then i said wassup
I took her to the crib
And you know I fucked (this is the G-Mix)
And toot it and boot it
Toot it and boot it
Toot it and boot it
That's why I toot it and boot it
Whoaaa ohhhh x3

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
First time i met her, i ain't know
She was a freak
Now i give her a girlfriend when
She want something to eat
She likes her, i love us
Them both my bitches nigga don't
Touch we got an open relationship
So i fuck with whoever i wanna fuck with
Champagne pop
The party it don't stop
After the after party better ask
Somebody than it's back to the crib
This the way i live
She toot it then i boot it

Give me California love right at back of my truck

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
My nephew YG said
Uncle Snoop Dogg
I got a pack of bras and i'm
Trying to hit them all
Kick 'em out and hit them all
Bounce till you ball, roll with the dog
Blow my house till you fall
Come a who, i'm a do i'm who
Girl, i'm an icon
Hit you in the dark with no light on
With my ice on, put my Nikes on
Now i´m soaring, pouring
Made in America but i'm so pouring
Lawin, miss me, hug me, dress me, love me, finess me
It's best we keep it on the slide on my CM
Throwing up the EAN

I toot it and boot it
I'm suited then sootit
Properly executed in front of
Beauty, like Kobe you know me
I'm gooter than Luda always gonna shot (ya dig!)
