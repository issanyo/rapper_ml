[Verse 1: Tish Hyman]
You say you love me, but you lyin' and I don't believe it
I said I don't want a relationship, and that's how I treat it
You gettin' mad cause I don't call you back
I be busy, on my grind, tryna get these stacks, I
Could never be feelin' you that much, to give all this up
My money and my pocket is the only one I trust
What do you think? I'm tryna get this bank
I don't got no time for no mothafuckin' games, I

[Pre-Chorus: Tish Hyman]
Love you, love you
Want my heart I
Love you, love you
Want my love, I
Love you, love you
Want my all
But I'm runnin' down this, runnin' down this road, I
Love you, love you
Want me there, I
Love you
Think that I don't care, I
Love you, love you
Want my all
But I'm runnin' down this, runnin' down this road

[Chorus: Tish Hyman]
With that same old dream
I'm on a mission with that same old dream
I'm out to get it with that same old dream
I'm gon' be winnin' with that same old dream

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I've been dreamin' 'bout it, thinkin' 'bout it all day
My mama told me music is a hobby
My ex-girlfriend gave up on me, I never gave up
I kept smokin' weed every day, then I came up
Hundred to a Chevy, Chevy to a Bimmer
Bimmer to a Porsche, she ain't mine, she yours
I just want the toppy, you can have her back now
I'm just spendin' racks now, I'm just blowin' cash now

[Chorus: Tish Hyman + Ty Dolla $ign]
Love you, love you
Want my heart I
Love you, love you
Want my love, I
Love you, love you
Want my all
But I'm runnin' down this, runnin' down this road, I
Love you, love you
Want me there, I
Love you
Think that I don't care
Love you, love you
Want my all
But I'm runnin' down this, runnin' down this road

[Chorus: Tish Hyman +Ty Dolla $ign]
With that same old dream
I'm on a mission with that same old dream
I'm out to get it with that same old dream
I'm gon' be winnin' with that same old dream
Tishy, baby, tell 'em what we dreamin', huh

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Dream so big, can't get no sleep
Stack money machine, when it hit those beeps
Sounds shallow, but the shit's so deep
It's lonely at the top, don't forget your peeps
Yeah, cause I ain't rich if he ain't rich
And she ain't rich, then we ain't rich
I hit the road and she ain't bitch
Over ten in the game and he ain't switch
I'm havin' dreams about gettin' this money
Havin' nightmares of them gettin' it from me
Wakin' up to it, it's time to go do it
It must be new hundreds if they say I blew it, let's get it

The only one that I'm searchin' for is one million
And after that I'm gon' be searchin' for two million
I want a threesome with the money (ding)
And I ain't playin', this ain't funny

[Chorus: Tish Hyman]
Cause I'm on a mission with that same old dream
I'm out to get it with that same old dream
I'm gon' be winnin' with that same old dream
With that same old dream
I'm on a mission with that same old dream
I'm out to get it with that same old dream
I'm gon' be winnin' with that same old dream
