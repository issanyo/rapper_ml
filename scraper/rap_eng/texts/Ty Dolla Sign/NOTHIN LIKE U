[Chorus]
Nothin' like you (Ooh, yeah)
They don't make 'em like you, ayy (Oh, yeah)
Nothin' like you, no (Woah)
They ain't built like you, no (Ooh, yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Tryna pull up on, pull up on you
Know that I want, that I want you
Put it on me, I put it on you (Put it on you)
Got a check on me, I spend it on you (Ooh, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Lookin' like a whole snack (Ooh, yeah)
I can't wait I can't hold back (Ooh, yeah)
Phone blowin' up back to back
Tell a nigga stop reachin' he can't have you back
Ooh, new coupe and it parked outside (Outside)
You don't even wanna go out tonight
Say you got priorities
And lately you've been wantin' to see way more of me

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Strawberry how it taste
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hell yeah, it's worth the wait, oh

[Chorus]
Nothin' like you (Nothin' like you)
They don't make 'em like you (Ooh, yeah)
Ayy, nothin' like you, no (Ooh, yeah)
They ain't built like you, no (They ain't you, yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Tryna pull up on, pull up on you (On)
Know that I want, that I want you (Want)
Put it on me, I put it on you (Put it on you)
Got a check on me, I spend it on you

[Verse 2]
Wait, wait
Take your time, baby, don't rush it
Let's stop talkin' about the money
When we can be kissin' and fuckin'
I ain't worried 'bout your ex
You told me, "Baby, you the best"
Buy you a diamond choker necklace
And matchin' Rolexes

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Strawberry how it taste
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hell yeah, it's worth the wait, oh

[Chorus]
Nothin' like you (Nothin' like you)
They don't make 'em like you (Ooh, yeah)
Ayy, nothin' like you, no (Ooh yeah)
They ain't built like you, no (They ain't you, yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Tryna pull up on, pull up on you (On)
Know that I want, that I want you (Want)
Put it on me, I'll put it on you (Put it on you)
Got a check on me, I spend it on you

[Verse 3]
Don't be playin' games, girl, let's get a suite (Suite)
I'm tryna spread your legs (Legs)
Talking VVS on your chest
Lucky charms on your neck
Put your double D's in my 'Ventador (Dor)
Put you in designer that new Dior (Dior)
Baby we want the same, we should be honest
Long as you're here with me, we know it's timeless

[Chorus]
Nothin' like you (Nothin' like you)
They don't make 'em like you (Ooh, yeah)
Ayy, nothin' like you, no (Ooh, yeah)
They ain't built like you, no (They ain't you, yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Tryna pull up on, pull up on you (On)
Know that I want, that I want you (Want)
Put it on me, I put it on you (Put it on you)
Got a check on me, I spend it on you

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
