[Intro]
You should move to L.A. with your best friend
You should move to L.A. with your best friend

You should move to L.A. with your best friend (Ooh, yeah)

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
'Cause I ain't here to play with you
Baby, you gon' get this work
'Cause I ain't here to play with you
Baby, you gon' get this work
Yeah, baby you gon' get this 9 to 5
5 to 9 and overtime
Yeah, you know it's only right
Uh, you know it's only right

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Now, Raww be the man, wanna see you doin' good
I don't wanna get rich, leave you in the hood
Girl, in my eyes, you the baddest
The reason why I love you, you don't like me, kill my status
I see you livin' average, I'd be offended
If they see you with me, they gon' wanna take pictures
Bitch so bad, I hope they get your face in it
I'm just tryna Jay Leno, you know, stay up late with you
You should move to L.A. with your best friend
Get you a condo and a new Benz
Bad girl, bad girl, baddest girl
Eatin' Whole Foods but ya got a fatty, girl
She call me lil daddy, she a daddy's girl
I let her breathe, whoo
Then I tell her, "Get back at it, girl"

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign with Tyga]
'Cause I ain't here to play with you
Baby, you gon' get this work
Yeah, baby you gon' get this 9 to 5
5 to 9 and overtime
'Cause I ain't here to play with you
Baby, you gon' get this work
Yeah, baby you gon' get this 9 to 5
5 to 9 and overtime
Yeah, you know it's only right
Uh, you know it's only right

[Verse 2: Tyga & Ty Dolla $ign]
Hey mama, won't you come to T dada ?
Keep you in Chanel 'cause the devil wear Prada
In the Maybach, then I smoke the cigara
You should move to L.A., I think I see your baby father
Here go the number to mi casa
Crib like Pablo, I got the whole enchilada
Once you pop in, it ain't no stoppin'
Baby, you gon' get this work
Cause I ain't here to play with you
Take you on tour, I can tell you was meant for me
If they ask who your man, you should mention me
I throw a chain on you, then make you sing for me
And you like to smoke when you drink and we be cross-faded, oh baby
When our signals get crossed, I hate it
'Cause the more you treat me royal, I adore you
That's why I don't mind doing all these things for you
It's only right we spend our lonely nights
In the 'Rari down Sunset, revving them pipes
I ain't T.I. but you get whatever you like
TY, he get you the keys tonight
Just get on your flight

[Chorus Ty Dolla $ign]
Baby, you gon' get this work
Yeah, baby you gon' get this 9 to 5
5 to 9 and overtime
'Cause I ain't here to play with you
Baby, you gon' get this work
Yeah, baby you gon' get this 9 to 5
5 to 9 and overtime
Yeah, you know it's only right
Uh, you know it's only right

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign & Tyga]
Know it's only right
9 to 5, 5 to 9, all the time
You should move to L.A. with your best friend
You should move to L.A. with your best friend
You should move to L.A. with your best friend
9 to 5, 5 to 9, all the time
You should move to L.A. with your best friend
You should move to L.A. with your best friend
You should move to L.A. with your best friend
You should move to L.A. with your best friend
You should move to L.A. with your best friend
You should move to L.A. with your best friend
