[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Love a bitch take the dick like she ain't got a backbone
Digging in the bitch like a motherfucking shovel
Love when thick hoes with thick pussy be skinny
Put my dick in - she tell me keep on digging
Digging, digging, digging, digging
Oh, digging, digging
Put my dick in - she tell me keep on digging

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla sign pulled up on her in the beamer
501s, YSL belt with the TISA
Tatted up, gatted up, thumbs in the bezzle
Kush rolled up, purple cup, I'm on my level
Twenty bands on me, what the fuck I need a bank for?
9-double-m what the fuck I need a shank for?
Goons rolling with me, bet you heard about the crew
Fuck a motherfucker bodyguard would rather shoot
Told that bitch to hop in, bring one of her friends
Back to my penthouse, saying we can get it in
She told me "OK", but she ain't gay though
Bet she eat pussy for Pusha Ink the label

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Clean, mad waist, big booty, no butt pad
Bitch so bad, put the pussy on my moustache
Turn my tongue around in the pussy like a ceiling fan
Long-ass weave she put it up in a pony-tail
When she suck my dick, her jewellery sound like a jingle-bell
Rolling off a molly and my sprite real dirty
And [?] sitting under candles happy birthday
This one right here is for all the grown women
That can take a dick with your face up in the pillow
I tell her shut up, get it! Then I keep on digging

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Moses]
501s fitted hat with the whooper
Pussy so fat, nickname the bitch chalupa
JM haah! I'm the bitch King Koopa
Baby be my present so I can't have a future
Dig her down slowly, can you be my goalie?
Canary diamond chain with the same color Rollie
Same color earrings, same color bracelet
Took the city over, real niggas gon' embrace it
YSL leopards, Bentley black pepper
Rims 22's, inside be ketchup
I do it for the paper, ratchets gon' follow
Beach House ready, B's up, Ty Dolla
