[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
$ign, Dolla $ign
It's The Kid Rich

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Got a light skinned bitch, she drive a ‘Cede Benz
Say she ain't trippin' bout the other, just don't fuck her friends
I'm smokin' dope, I'm smokin' dope inside this 911
I'm gettin' head, I'm gettin' head in this 911
Got a light skinned bitch, she drive a ‘Cede Benz
Say she ain't trippin' bout the other, just don't fuck her friends
I'm smokin' dope, I'm smokin' dope inside this 911
I'm gettin' head, I'm gettin' head in this 911

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh we don't fuck with popo, we don't talk to 911
I need the whole O but used to only cop a seven
We eating [?] I used to go to Taco Bell
We out at Manchester, [bad bih taco mell
I'm blowin' Louie 13, got pot for sale
I'm at the plug with the crip at Ft. Lauterdale
I'm met a spanish bitch that live on a Sunday
I bagged a bad model bitch off the runway

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Me and the plug at the border
Rollie got water like Florida
Your bitch, she ride like the M.A.R.T.A
Breaking my wrist, I'm whippin' harder
Ain't playing bout mine
Money up, gotta grind
Juug and finesse all the time
I'm in the trap with Ty Dolla $ign
Made a mill on a midget
Fake niggas can't kick it
Y'all talking, I live it
All the money, I gotta get it
100 bands for a show
Walking with a bankroll
Pull up in the coupe with two hoes
I'm in a pot and I'm whippin' slow

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Got a light skinned bitch, she drive a ‘Cede Benz
Say she ain't trippin' bout the other, just don't fuck her friends
I'm smokin' dope, I'm smokin' dope inside this 911
I'm gettin' head, I'm gettin' head in this 911
Got a light skinned bitch, she drive a ‘Cede Benz
Say she ain't trippin' bout the other, just don't fuck her friends
I'm smokin' dope, I'm smokin' dope inside this 911
I'm gettin' lit, I'm gettin' lit in this 911

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Walking around with the bankroll
I started trapping that elbow
Came up from the corner
New 'Rari, not the charger
I put that bitch on the molly
She suckin' me up at the back of Follies
Fuck 911, free Bobby, Rowdy
We started dabbin' they copy
I done ran to the plug
Had to get out the mud
I'mma  murk him with a glove
Sippin' Act while in the club
Got a lotta hoes like I'm Pimp
Big dawg, you a shrimp
Lotta racks, got a limp
Dunking the pot like Shawn Kemp

[Verse 4: Ty Dolla $ign]
I fell asleep on the lean
I got back up on the Molly
I'm at a thick bitch at Follies
I'm making daily deposits
The Orange Tesla
OG Kush and liquor
Fucking on a stripper with some pierced nipples
Got tired of business
When we in the bity
All my niggas solid
All you niggas mickey
Bitch I think I'm Pac
Bitch I think I'm Biggie
Yeah, young and rich
And around my city

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]

I'm gettin' lit, I'm gettin' lit in this 911
