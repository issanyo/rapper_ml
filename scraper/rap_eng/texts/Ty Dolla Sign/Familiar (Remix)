[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
That girl look familiar
Real recognize real, that's familiar
I be ridin' in the whip that ain't familiar
Getting to the money, that's familiar
Oh that's familiar
That can't be your girl, she familiar
If you ain't real, we don't feel ya
Say my name to these hoes, that's familiar

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Say my name to these hoes, that's familiar
My name in these streets, that's familiar
Got so many hoes I can't remember
Young, rich nigga with a temper
Double cup full of Act, I be poured up
In the club, and my second chunk up
They know these hoes, they showin' love
These ho niggas get no love
We going up like every night
I fuck a bitch on every flight
But a bad bitch getting threesomes
I said ok, I'll marry ya
Yeah, she know that I'm that nigga
And if they say yo name ain't that familiar?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I done fell in love with a stripper
I just might get married at the strip club
I'll be serving liquor and some chicken wings
And all she ever wanted was some ding-a-ling
And I don't know what I did last night
Cause I ain't really been to sleep yet
I'm knee deep in pussy
I'm trying to get my feet wet
And i ain't playing with these niggas
Oh no this not recess
I eat it up, beat it up
Then start it over like reset
Oooooooohhhh like Ty Dolla
All these hoes think they fly
I'm they fly swatter
It don't really turn me on man unless she swallow
Started at 11:50pm and fucked her til tomorrow
