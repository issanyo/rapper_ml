[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla $ign
Earl
Uh, Mike Free on tha beat
Ay

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I got a bad brown skin from Atlanta (ATL)
Uh and she a private dancer (she a dancer)
Said she make at least 4K a night (4 Thousand)
I told her get ya money that's right (that's right)
That's right, that's right
Girl get ya money that's right
We don't want her if she broke no
Twerkin' all night girl that's right

[Verse 1: E-40]
Uhh, rap now but I used to push coke, fit cost more than ya car note
I could pull a ho without a rope, without a penny in my pocket
Even if a nigga broke, bitch I go the hardest
Bay boy, got the mouthpiece of a con artist
Ye, I could talk my way into anything
I could talk my way into the white house, and get kicked out for smoking weed
That's nigga shit 201, see that bitch right there?
She thicker than my other one, she cheeky she cheeky her body smackin'
She see me she think I'm rapping or trappin'
Ugh, but I don't pay for coochie, coochie pay for me
We in the V.I.P, Dolla $ign, 40 and free
Smokin' Larry OG, hella toasted, twisted and tipsy
Don't talk to me bruh, I'm whiskey, been cheefin' with all my hippies

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Do yo dance do yo dance, while I pop these rubber bands
It's only ballers in my section (at my table)
After the club we sexin' (oh yeah)
Ay, she got ass like (?)
And she like girls like Latifah
Took her to the Bay told her smoke something
My nigga E-40 told me don't cuff her, don't cuff her
Nigga woah, woah, call that bitch Christmas, ho ho
Never trust, a nigga or a bitch
The nigga I die for I ever snitch
Dolla $ign the Taylor and the Pusha
I be bangin', tell her "fingers in the pussy"
She wanna fuck me in my vans, and my hoodie
Before she gotta fuck, beat the big booty
