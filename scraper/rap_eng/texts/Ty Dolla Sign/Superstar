[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Second nature to a player to do it major
Meet a broad, game her, get the panties and the paper
She gon' pay you if you do it how I say to
Just trynna lace you
A lil free game to all my neighbors
Door to door these hoes will go digging
Know I rock hella precious rose, white, yellow
They know better then to bring that hoeness when approaching a go getter
Professional Corvetter, Forgiato off-setter
Set this bitch off, set this bitch up for a weekend
Let her stay in my loft
Now she highed up day dreaming
Lost in the boss-ness, thinking she seen it all
This just a small part
We ain't even get out my car yet girl

[Hook: Curren$y]
She got her blinkers on, my game tight
Turning her on, turning her right
Into what she want to be her whole life
She a superstar in my car tonight
Make her a superstar in my car tonight
And she a superstar in my car tonight
Turning her out, turning her right
Into a superstar in my car tonight

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl you a superstar in my car yeah
You remind of Beyonc√© in that car yeah
On the freeway chiefin' big in the car yeah
Hell nah you can't smoke no cigs in the car yeah
Sex in the car yeah, head in the car yeah
I pull that bih over, hit it right in the driveway
Baby come my way
We be fucking for hours
I took her from her ex-man, he was a coward
But see both agree I hit it better than you ever had it
Girl you know I can't be your man so I'll just be your nigga

[Hook: Curren$y]
She got her blinkers on, my game tight
Turning her on, turning her right
Into what she want to be her whole life
She a superstar in my car tonight
Make her a superstar in my car tonight
And she a superstar in my car tonight
Turning her out, turning her right
Into a superstar in my car tonight

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
I bought this just for you to see it
I sitting in my car chiefin'
Tell your homegirls that you leaving
Y'all could kick it some other evening
I'm not speeding it just feel like we is
Cause you ain't used to this, exclusiveness
Super cars parked outside the bar
That's how we set the bar high
As we was when I met
I'm surprised that I didn't forget
But you kept my attention since I made my grand entrance
It's bad ones in her, but you number one contender
Heavy smoking, light drinking, can't get too bent
Because I still gotta handle a Bent, that bitch quick

[Hook: Curren$y]
She got her blinkers on, my game tight
Turning her on, turning her right
Into what she want to be her whole life
She a superstar in my car tonight
Make her a superstar in my car tonight
And she a superstar in my car tonight
Turning her out, turning her right
Into a superstar in my car tonight
