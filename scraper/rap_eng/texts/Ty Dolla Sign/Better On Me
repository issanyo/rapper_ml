[Intro: Pitbull]
You have to have vision to understand love is blind, talk to â€˜em Ty

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
It's been a while and you found somebody else
They say you really doing good for yourself
But I know you out there feeling so lonely
As far as my eyes can see
Don't need no proof or no validation
You leave no wound on you second to none
You said you over me but you looking lonely
So as far as my eyes can see, you look better on me
Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw
You look better on me
Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw
As far as my eyes can see, you look better on me

[Verse 1]
Got a room with a mirror on the roof
Down in the keys keys keys
And I could bet the bank and almost guarantee
That you will always look better on me
I handle my business in the boardroom and the bedroom
My name ain't max but I always got headroom
G-g- get it, g-g- g-g- get it
Went from selling perico and reefer
To New Year's Eve with Snoop and Latifah
I shut down Spain
And I ain't even have to take a pill in Ibiza
I'm a beast bro
I love when you put on them sexy one piece outfits
With the hole in the middle
Now take a look in the mirror
And see you always look better on me

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
It's been a while and you found somebody else
They say you really doing good for yourself
But I know you out there feeling so lonely
As far as my eyes can see
Don't need no proof or no validation
You leave no wound on you second to none
You said you over me but you looking lonely
So as far as my eyes can see, you look better on me
Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw
You look better on me
Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw
As far as my eyes can see, you look better on me

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I'm allergic to the fake and these negative crabs
So get from me with your negative ass
I live for the future, you live in the past
Found somebody else, I hope that it lasts
But you know that I know that we know that you'll be thinking bout me
But you know that I know that we know that you look, that you look better on me
I ain't here to sell ya, I'm here to tell ya, all I've ever done is learn from my failures
So god bless mami, cause God knows I wish you the best mami, that's right
I love when you put on that sexy one piece outfit with the hole in the middle
Now take a look in the mirror and see you always look better on me

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
It's been a while and you found somebody else
They say you really doing good for yourself
But I know you out there feeling so lonely
As far as my eyes can see
Don't need no proof or no validation
You leave no wound on you second to none
You said you over me but you looking lonely
So as far as my eyes can see, you look better on me
Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw
You look better on me
Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw
As far as my eyes can see, you look better on me

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Better on me
Better on me
Better on me
You look better on me
Better on me
Better on me
As far as my eyes can see, you look better on me
