[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Skrrt, skrrt, yeah
Sound, sound, sound

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I've been stressin', I've been up all night
Had to leave them hoes alone, had to focus on my life, yeah
I've been flexin' with you on my mind
You ain't even gotta test it, girl, you know you're my lil' favorite
Lil', lil', skrrt, skrrt
Lil' favorite, lil', lil', lil', lil', skrrt, skrrt

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, I can't trust no one so I be on my lonely
She say I fuck around, that's why she keep ignorin' me
You tyin' up my line, but baby, that's the old me
I'm dealin' with a lot, this liquor keep on pouring
I beat a case, they tried to make me do the whole thing
So when you say you love me, girl, you gotta show me

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm done with chasin' love, I'm fuckin' with you only
I’m tryna make it, so I don’t end up your homie

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I've been stressin', I've been up all night
Had to leave them hoes alone, had to focus on my life, yeah
I've been flexin' with you on my mind
You ain't even gotta test it, girl, you know you're my lil' favorite
Lil', lil', skrrt, skrrt
Lil' favorite, lil', lil', lil', lil', skrrt, skrrt

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, said I fuck around, I swear that's what she told me
All she wanna do is lay up and on me
Got a bag, then we blew it all together
Got a bag, then we ran up that Margiela
Put lil' shawty in a pearl and diamond necklace
Got a Porsche and I dri-ive reckless (skrrt)

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm done with chasin' love, I'm fuckin' with you only
I'm tryna make it so I don't end up your homie

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I've been stressin', I've been up all night
Had to leave them hoes alone, had to focus on my life, yeah
I've been flexin', with you on my mind
You ain't even gotta test it, girl, you know you're my lil' favorite
Lil', lil', skrrt, skrrt
Lil' favorite, lil', lil', lil', lil', skrrt, skrrt

[Verse 3: MadeinTYO]
Ooh, Louis on her belt, never leave her by herself
Ooh, diamonds too damn cold, they'll never melt (bling blaow)
Playin' Speaker Knockerz on my lonely (skrrt skrrt)

Bands in my pocket, yeah you know I got it (yuh)

Pull up in that foreign playin' Lady Gaga (skrrt skrrt)

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]

Lil', lil', skrrt, skrrt
Lil' favorite, lil', lil', lil', lil', skrrt, skrrt
Skrrt, skrrt
