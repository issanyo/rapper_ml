[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
All this weed in my system ain't helpin' (ain't helpin')
And this drank got you lookin' so good (so good)
I got some mollies in my hand, I might take one (take one)
And after I finish what's in my cup
You know I'm tryna love you
All these drugs-drugs make me wanna love you
Okay, okay, okay, okay

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I just wanna shoot a movie with a chick from out the movies
With a big old ghetto booty that know how to roll a doobie
I just wanna hit the club, throw some money on the stage
I just wanna tip a stripper more dough than she ever made
More dough than she ever seen, now she see me in her dreams
All that ass, shawty bust it, how she stuff it in her jeans
Must run in her genes, I just wanna meet her momma
I just wanna smoke my presidential Juicy J Obama
Juicy J that OG, I been ballin' this whole week
Stuntin' 20 years plus, I can do this in my sleep
I just wanna fall in Onyx with a fine Georgia peach
Got that rocket in my pocket, that's that beauty and the beast

[Hook]
All this weed in my system ain't helpin' (ain't helpin')

I got some mollies in my hand, I might take one (take one)
And after I finish what's in my cup
You know I'm tryna love you
All these drugs-drugs make me wanna love you
Okay, okay, okay, okay

[Verse 2: Drake]
Legendary, love you so much it's unnecessary
Like it's always two weeks into February
You can take that shit to the cemetery, til we're dead and buried
But girl God forbid I feel too alive
Around you I got too much pride
Do we let it breathe or put a title on it?
I'm so indecisive, I'll let you decide
She like nah seem like your chakra's off
I'm like nah it's just that your top is off
And I started out wantin' to talk to you
And now all I can think about is poppin' off
Girl you're all that matters
You in bra and panties, that's automatic
You straddled me, I started fallin' backwards
Don't worry about the phone you can call them after
Bout to take ya down

[Hook]
All this weed in my system ain't helpin' (ain't helpin')

I got some mollies in my hand, I might take one (take one)
And after I finish what's in my cup
You know I'm tryna love you
All these drugs-drugs make me wanna love you
Okay, okay, okay, okay
