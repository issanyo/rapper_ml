Got two phones, for two new hoes
Two new hoes, two new hoes
Barely speak English, talk to me with hand signs
She barely speak English, she talk with her new mouth
She barely speak English, 'cause I don't want...
She barely speak English, so she ain't gotta talk
She barely speak English, so she ain't gotta talk
She know I got the bag on me, tell by how I ball
Barely speak English 'cause I don't want...
She barely speak English so she ain't gotta talk
