[Verse 1: Bebe Rexha]
You're sayin' that your tired of all your empty habits
You want something that's deeper, 'cause you're over the generics
You're fuckin' with them basics when you really want the baddest
So c'mon, baby, get it, 'cause to miss it, it would be tragic

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
You say you want a bad bitch
Baby, now you have it
Now you got a bad bitch
Show me you can handle this
Say you want a bad bitch
Baby, now you have it
Now you got the baddest
Show me you can handle this

[Post-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Bad bitch, bad bitch
Bad bitch, bad bitch
Show me you can handle this
Bad bitch, bad bitch
Bad bitch, bad bitch
Show me you can handle this
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
You know I can handle it
You know I can handle it
When you throw that thing back at me like a lateral
You be goin' all night when you on that adderall
We be goin' all night when you on that adderall
Bad bitch, bad bitch
You ain't never average
Get some double C’s on your bag with the brass, oh
Bad bitch, bad bitch
You ain’t never average
St. Laurent jeans with the St. Laurent bag too

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
You say you want a bad bitch
Baby, now you have it
Now you got a bad bitch
Show me you can handle this
Say you want a bad bitch
Baby, now you have it
Now you got the baddest
Show me you can handle this

[Post-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Bad bitch, bad bitch
Bad bitch, bad bitch
Bad bitch, bad bitch
Bad bitch, bad bitch
Show me you can handle this
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Bebe Rexha]
I pay my own bills and I pay my own rent
'Cause I'm indepen-independent
I buy my own rings and I do my own things
'Cause I'm indepen-independent
I know it really hurts, I know it ain't fair
You're not allowed to touch, but you can stare
Know it really hurts, know it ain't fair
So keep sayin' your prayers

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
You say you want a bad bitch
Baby, now you have it
Now you got a bad bitch
Show me you can handle this
Say you want a bad bitch
Baby, now you have it
Now you got the baddest
Show me you can handle this

[Outro: Bebe Rexha]
Bad bitch, bad bitch
Bad bitch, bad bitch
Bad bitch, bad bitch
Bad bitch, bad bitch
Show me you can handle this
