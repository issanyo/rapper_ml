[Verse 1]
Passenger side with talc in this brief
We the reaper
Who, in the morning
Predominantly black
Got the seether
But I ride
‘Bout my business
In the zone
Thinkin’ ‘bout past times
Every one of mine
That I done lost
Hood for the last time
No smokin’ and drinkin’
I’m sober
I gather faces
Like this bitch
Goin’ here first
Way down below
She gather faces
But until the lil’ [?]
To try to fight it
Go ahead
Embrace it
I’m a shine
Representin’ for my niggas
You can’t replace it
I’m just doin’ what I do
And what I do is keep it gangsta
Reppin’ for the place
Where you get snitchin’
They hang ya
Them from the jungle
Where it’s wild
And they can’t tame ya
Get ‘em back for what they done to yours
Can’t no one blame ya
I’m in the lead
Like Harden
I beg ya pardon
Better watch what you gonna say
‘fore I send you somewhere you starvin’
The homies on the green
Talkin’ no g
Fresh out their garden
[?] smokin’
You washin’ on the planet
Like you [?]

[Hook]
Smokin’ and sippin’
I been going through some shit
Gettin’ high reminiscin’
God, I miss my niggas
Ooh yeah
Oh, whoa whoa
Whoa, yeah

Gettin’ fucked up
Tryin’ not to crash

Oh, yeah
Smokin’ and sippin
(Going through my head)
Smokin’ and sippin’

Smokin’ and sippin’

[Verse 2]
Remiscin’ ‘bout robbin’
They did some money clip
[?] and my brother
Who’s stuck in the cage
Doin’ life in the pen
They take WK
One day I see you again
Until then, I’m gonna jump off
In this shit and hustle the win
Them that got me tempted
To sip somethin’ then drift away
On the cool, you know I’d be lyin’
There won’t be shit today
Gotta stay the truth
And the truth is
I’d deal with it
Tryin’ to keep my cool
But if you trip
Just know you’ll still get it
The shoes I got on steal
Figured I gotta hold it down, homey
Fend it like a champ
And take it off
For me and mine, homey
You ain’t worried ‘bout the risks
I’m out here ownin’
For me and my homies
Live to reminisce
‘Cause in this life
You can’t rewind, homey
Frisk test when it’s time
To let the pain cry
(Cry)
Barely made it out the bottom
So I aim high
(High)
And I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout the smoke
I’m talkin’ visionary
Crucify the slayer
Top back call it missionary

[Chorus]
Hey, smokin’ and sippin’
I been going through some shit
Gettin’ high reminiscin’
God, I miss my niggas
Ooh, yeah
Whoa, whoa, yeah
Ooh
I’m just smokin’ and sippin’
Ridin’ in the four wheel
(Yeah)
Gettin’ fucked up
Tryin’ not to crash
My shit
Ooh, yeah
Whoa
Ah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Smokin’ and sippin’
(Going through my head)
Smokin’ and sippin’
Smokin’ and sippin’
(Oh)
Smokin’ and sippin’
Dah, dah, dah
