[Intro: 50 Cent]
(Fifty, yeah)
Now we can play but you can’t stay
You gotta go
You gotta go
Now we can play but you can’t stay
You gotta go
You gotta go

[Hook: Ty$]
I met her at the club
Then I said wassup
I took her to the crib
You know I fucked
Yeah toot it and boot it
Toot it and boot it
Toot it and boot it
That's why I toot and boot it
Whoaa whoa, whoaa whoa, whoaa whoa, whoaa whoa

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
First time I met her, I ain't know she was a freak
Now I give her a girlfriend when she want something to eat
She likes her, I love us
Them both my bitches, nigga don’t touch
We got an open relationship
So I fuck with whoever I wanna fuck with
Champagne pop, the party it don’t stop
After the after-party better ask somebody
Then it’s back to the crib, this is the way I live
She toot it then I boot it out
I chew another chick
She know how I get down
2Pac I get around
Give me California love right at the back of my truck

[Hook]

[Verse 2: YG]
Girl let me toot that boot that stop acting stupid
Acting like you don't know me like who that
Walked in the club but I'll fly things
I'm in the back girl you know where to find me
And I love how she think I'm cute
And she don't even wanna tell me what she wanna do
It's me and my crew, her and her friends
And they all trying to leave with us when the club ends
And she toot it from the back and you know she made it clap
And you know I run it back like
Only for one night
And she know I'm on like a switch-on light
Hey girl I can have you feeling right
I can supply the pipe
Just make sure it's tight
We can do it all day only for one night
And after that you gotta go

[Hook]

[Outro: YG]
I toot it to the left, I toot it to the right
Fuck with me we gonna do it all night
I seen a bad bitch I swing my hat back
And after I hit it's on my back
Cause I toot it and boot it, and it made her feel stupid
Cause I toot it and boot it, and it made her feel stupid

[Hook]
