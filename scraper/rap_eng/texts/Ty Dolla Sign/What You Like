[Intro: 24hrs]
24hrs and you know it's Hit-Boy
24 hits, Twenty with your bitch

[Chorus: 24hrs]
I wouldn't mind if you stay the night
Send your first and last name for the flight
Don't confuse me with all the hype
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like
On the Instagram I see all the likes
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
Shawty from the A, she in L.A
She say, "Twenty where the fuck we finna stay?"
Told her, "Baby, got the condo by the Staples"
I told her I'll pick her up if she ain't able
She said, "Twenty, I got friends out here"
I told her I'll send an Uber if they near
She said, "Bein' with a broke boy is my fear"
I told her, "Baby get the fuck up out of here"
Getting money every day, what I strive
Got a bad bitch that stay in LA Liv
Baby, you should finish up your task
Me and Hit in the Wraith driving fast

[Chorus: 24hrs]

Send your first and last name for the flight

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Shawty from the Bay, she in New York
She said, "Dolla when you comin' on tour?"
Told her I'ma get a suite off 40 deuce
Don't worry 'bout it, I'ma send the car to you
She said, "Dolla, I got friends for your man"
"I ain't pressin', I know you a busy man"
She said, "Bein' with a rapper is my fear"
I said, "Baby get the fuck out of here"
Gettin' money everyday, that's my work
Got a bad bitch stayin' where your spurt
Told her, "Hit me when you ready to go"
Pick you up with a fat pre roll

[Chorus: 24hrs]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Got a bad bitch down in M.I.A
When I'm near, she let me fuck, but she don't stay
Taught her how to suck a dick the right way
Was Backwoods but now she smokin' paper planes
It's Young Khalifa man, only spittin' facts
Let her man go 'cause that nigga whack
I'm a Virgo so I don't know how to act
You a freak so I'ma hit it from the back
Told her I was down at the Fontainebleau
Seen your friend on Snapchat, bring her through
I don't chase no bitch, I let her choose
I don't mix my liquor with no juice

[Chorus: 24hrs]
I wouldn't mind if you stay the night
Send your first and last name for the flight
Don't confuse me with all the hype
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like
On the Instagram I see all the likes
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like

[Outro]
What you like, what you like, what you like, what you like
What you like, what you like, what you like, what you like
What you like, what you like, what you like, what you like
