[Intro: Jay 305]
Yeah, whats happening
First of all, I'm westside Jay 305 right here with my nigga Ty
Going on this rode we come from South Central and all
Seen a lot of bullshit
Through the bullshit we fell into politics
From politics we tryin to get rich
Being a real one, you gotta stay on your grind
Gotta stay bein' a man, gotta stay havin' a plan
But back to the bullshit, fuck the bullshit
These niggas don't know
Haha fuck you hoes, biitch

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
These niggas dont know
These niggas really don't know
What it takes to be a real one
Cause i ain't never snitched on a nigga
Never put a bitch over my niggas
These niggas dont know
These niggas really don't know
What it takes to really be the man
I put on for my city look how many niggas got on with me

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
These niggas ain't nothing
These niggas just bluffin
These niggas just started getting hoes
Still ain't got no money though
These niggas still renting cars
That Lamborghini ain't yours
Tell me why niggas front
Homie let me teach you how to stunt
Its realness over millions
You niggas fake it till' you make it though
It's love over money
Won't put a bitch over my niggas though
Yeah I done seen a lot of fake shit
This bitch ain't bad she basic
These niggas ain't sayin shit

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
These niggas don't know
These niggas really don't know
What it takes to be a real one
Cause I ain't never snitched on a nigga
Never put a bitch over my niggas
These niggas dont know
These niggas really don't know
What it takes to really be the man
I put on for my city look how many niggas got on with me

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
It's the young and acquiring
Got em' all incquiring
Working extra late to get that early retirement
Takin vacays when my mind needs a rewiring
Everything I want is not a want it's a requirement
She asked me how much publishin' I made off of my BMI
And even though she gave me TNA I told her TMI
I'm livin the life you read about
Lately I've been drinking and taking vitamins hoping it evens out
Like what you know bout' grinding straight for a thousand nights
Before I hit a home-run swear I had a thousand strikes
Chillin with bad bitches taking naked pictures
Fuck a thousand dollars she gon' do it for a thousand likes
God damn, it's crazy what a cold bitch will do for hot sand
It's crazy what a young bitch will do to old men
For her own car, own Benz then lie
Like y'all fuck? Na we just hold hands hands
Like these niggas don't know

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
These niggas don't know
These niggas really don't know
What it takes to be a real one
Cause I ain't never snitched on a nigga
Never put a bitch over my niggas
These niggas dont know
These niggas really don't know
What it takes to really be the man
I put on for my city look how many niggas got on with me
