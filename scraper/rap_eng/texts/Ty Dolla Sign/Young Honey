[Verse 1: Ty Dolla]
Little honey
Getting money
Independent and she wit it
Little mama get your money why you bullshitting (stop it)
Never let a broke nigga tell you how to spend it
Red bottoms, all red Mercedes
In the gym every day far from lazy
Freak in the bed, but she still a lady
Cook, clean good and she fuck me crazy
Light skin girls always got an attitude
Baby knows she looks good so she act rude
Hair done, nails did and some tattoos
Nice shape she don't fuck with the fast food
Never seen her with a lame dude
Put herself first like the rent due
You don't need me, that's why I want you
Let the Dolla $ign hit it, kung-fu

[Hook: Ty Dolla]
Young honey getting money

She don't need nothing from me
She don't need nothing from me
Young honey getting money, she get her own money
Young honey getting money, woah oh
Young honey getting money, she get her own money
Young honey getting money, woah oh...

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla]
Little honey got gifts like Santa
Make her do tricks like abra cadabra
Too dry like Jamaicans
Make the booty earthquake like Haitian
Shake that money money maker
In the club but she got her own table
Got her signed Pushaz Ink the label
Bitch we on fire like Fuego-o-o
She bad but she do what I say though
I'm in charge like San Diego
She put herself together like Legos
Play with the pussy like Play-doh
My dick bigger than an anaconda
She like girls that say yes like Obama
And she can get it when she wanna
Baby racked up, young honey got hundreds

[Hook: Ty Dolla]
Young honey getting money
Young honey getting money
She don't need nothing from me
She don't need nothing from me
Young honey getting money, she get her own money
Young honey getting money, woah oh
Young honey getting money, she get her own money
Young honey getting money, woah oh...

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
Little honey set it off, like Jada
Get money do your thang get paper
Heartbreak the gang, we bang on every hater
She rep the same as I so we major
I pull up in that [?] and she pull up in her own thang
Baby got that horsepower ride it like a Mustang
The way them other girls looking at her is disgusting
Her man blow her up when she with me she let the phone ring
Cuz that boy a lame-o, my Stussy kicks is camo
Shit I could go forever never running out of ammo
Young Suzy in this bitch I do my thang I got it handled
Niggas thinking it's a gamble leave their whole career in shambles
I don't gamble but it's always a bet with your boy
No road trips only jets with your boy
Rocking [?] got you [?]
Have you screaming til your ass can't take it no more
Ay!

[Hook: Ty Dolla]
