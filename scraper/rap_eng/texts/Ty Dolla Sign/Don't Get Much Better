[Chorus: Jeremih]
It doesn't get much better than this
Spent too much time getting ready for this
These days it seems like I just can't miss
And I must confess
It don't get much better than this (baby, ohh)
Don't get much better than this (ohh)
Don't get much better than this (baby, ohh)
Don't get much better than this
Don't get much better than this

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
And you know summertime is the perfect time (yeah)
I'm gon' win that race if I cross that line (yeah, yeah)
For every question, I got answers, baby (for ya, for ya)
I'm tryna touch you, girl, reachin' everywhere (yeah, yeah)
Just don't fuck up the vibe
Panties and problems, put them to the side
Pop that champagne, glasses up to the sky
Why not just live, have a hell of a time with me (yeah)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
It doesn't get much better than this
Spent too much time getting ready for this
These days it seems like I just can't miss
And I must confess
It don't get much better than this (baby, ohh)
Don't get much better than this (ohh)
Don't get much better than this (baby, ohh)
Don't get much better than this
Don't get much better than this

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
We done been through it all
They was prayin' on our downfall
We move mountains, knock down the walls
Funny how they hate, they try to steal the soap
Bounce back after a loss
Stand out the way of the law
Fast lane gonna make the boy drop jaw
Candy paint on it, make this girl drop draws
Whoa, let's celebrate (mm)
You ain't get money, then I can't relate like
Ohh, ahh, ohh-ohh, ahh
I ain't never felt this good in my life

[Chorus: Jeremih]
It doesn't get much better than this
Spent too much time getting ready for this
These days it seems like I just can't miss
And I must confess
It don't get much better than this (baby, ohh)
Don't get much better than this (ohh)
Don't get much better than this (baby, ohh)
Don't get much better than this
Don't get much better than this

[Verse 3: Sage The Gemini]
I'm getting pretty good at the good life
Every play that I make is a highlight
I got a girl put the good good in the good night
And she giving me that look, that's a good sign
And she mighty fine
So it's easy like post-game lay-ups
Sharper than a needle at the place they filmed Frasier
Call game major, achieve game major
She know I crush a lot and I'm a player
All around the world, we seen it & we don' it
Tell 'em G how we run it
Shift gears and gun it
I reminisce when I open up the safe
Dodged every mousetrap in this rat race

[Chorus: Jeremih]
It doesn't get much better than this
Spent too much time getting ready for this
These days it seems like I just can't miss
And I must confess
It don't get much better than this (baby, ohh)
Don't get much better than this (ohh)
Don't get much better than this (baby, ohh)
Don't get much better than this
Don't get much better than this
