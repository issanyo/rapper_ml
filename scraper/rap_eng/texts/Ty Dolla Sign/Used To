You niggas broke like I used to
Now being broke I ain’t used to
You fucking bitches that I used to
Only bad bitches’ what I’m used to
Used to
That’s what I'm used to
Used to
That’s what I'm used to

[Verse 1]
[?] got a loose tooth
Boy you lucky I ain't shoot you
Momma always said I got a screw loose
16 walking 'round with the deuce deuce
They took TC when he was 18
Fuck the lawyer fuck the judge and the police
Fuck your hood and all your dead homies
If you ain't with me you against me
The G-code that's what I'm used to
We don’t love these hoes that's what I'm used to
Pass with my niggas' what I'm used to
Spend this cash with my niggas' what I'm used to

[Hook]
You niggas broke like I used to
Now being broke I ain’t used to
You fucking bitches that I used to
Only bad bitches’ what I’m used to
Used to

[Hook]
You niggas broke like I used to
Now being broke I ain’t used to
You fucking bitches that I used to
Only bad bitches’ what I’m used to
Used to

Used to

[Verse 2]

Only bad bitches here in my section
Real niggas here in my section
