[Intro: Terry Welles]
Hey, baby
Do me a favor
Won't you come back home?
(home, home)

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Sorry things ain't working out for you and that nigga
Girl I'm tired of talking to you now about you and that nigga
They think I've been thinkin' out loud 'bout you and that nigga
You just need to stay with him
I ain't making plans with him
I know you still lay with him
Know you sick of playin', know you sick of playin, eh
You just need to stay with him
I know you still lay with him
And now you sick of playin', now you sick of playin, eh
Girl, I'm tired of talkin' to you, I know about you and that nigga
Sorry things ain't working out for you and that, you and that nigga

[Verse: Ty Dolla $ign]
Sorry things ain't working out for you and that nigga
Keep on asking me what you should do with that nigga
Thought you was in love, now I'on't wanna know it
Now you pullin' up (skrr skrr)
Telling me you goin' through it
Go figure should've
Stayed down with a real one, say you fucked up, tough love
How you feel now
Call my line late night, tryna visit
Ahh, baby, are you finished?
Make your mind up
Make your bed, gotta lay up in it (Ooh yeah)
Ain't got no time to play around and you keep playin' with it
I treat the script just like a brick and make a flip
I use the drip now baby
Ooh, now, it is what it is

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
And I'm sorry things ain't working out with you and that nigga
Girl I'm tired of talking about you and that nigga
I don't give a fuck what you gon' do with that nigga
Oh, baby, you do what you do with that nigga

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Sorry things ain't working out for you and that nigga
Girl I'm tired of talking to you now about you and that nigga
They think I've been thinkin' out loud 'bout you and that nigga
You just need to stay with him
I ain't making plans with him
I know you still lay with him
Know you sick of playin', know you sick of playin, eh
You just need to stay with him
I know you still lay with him
And now you sick of playin', now you sick of playin, eh
Girl, I'm tired of talkin' to you, I know about you and that nigga
Sorry things ain't working out for you and that, you and that-
