[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
New belt that's french canvas
Goyard that's rich canvas
Showing out for the big cameras
Sonning niggas like the kids parents
Old money like the grandparents
Show respect or get bitch handled
Took her wigs like your grandmama
Smack a nigga like I'm big handed
Still a fuck on your babymama
Bigger booty she a thick bandit
Big body do big damage
New Rari do tricks in it
Trick is if thereâ€™s no kids in it
Tricked out Benz put a kid in it
'Cause she look so good throw a kid in it
Have a baby by me for the big business
