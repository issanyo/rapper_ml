[Verse]
Sipping on the Act, it got me thinking
Damn, my life is amazing
Damn, my Porsche is amazing
Damn, that bitch is amazing
I just fucked a bitch, she black and Asian
Her passport running out of pages
I just got my kitchen painted Paisley
Still got Act, it's amazing
Louis Thirteen kush, amazing
White girls with ass, that's amazing
When she deep throat, that's amazing
When she bring her friend, that's amazing
She said I'm nasty, I'm nasty
But she don't mean it in a bad way
Beat the pussy up in a good way
Now she want it every time when I'm

[Hook]
Back in the city, back in the city, back in the city
Back in the city, back in the city, I'm back in the city
Back in the city, back in the city, back in the city
Back in the city, back in the city, when I'm back in the city
You bitch might not be coming home
You bitch might not be coming home
