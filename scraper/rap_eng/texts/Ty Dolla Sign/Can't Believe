[Intro: Kranium]
Oh God, yeah, mmm

Inna late night, me and her locked down
Shift her draws to the side, ride the shotgun
Mhmm
Inna me dark glass, cut-off shorts, Clarks well clean...
Touch the road with mi bloodclaat team
See a gyal deh pon a corner a cry and a scream
You know say the boss haffi intervene
She say, her man nah give her the time
So, of course, you know say, me go give her the whine
Now she say how me is a one of a kind
And that's how she became mine
And see it deh

[Chorus: Kranium]
Can't believe I, him can't believe I
Take him girl away from him, oh God
Can't believe I, him can't believe I
Take him girl away from him, oh God

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
She want a rich nigga, not a broke one
She a boss too, she get her own money
Slim thicky with her booty and she know a nigga love that shit

When we're lost in the moment
And I'm deep in your ocean

[Chorus: Kranium]
Him can't believe I, can't believe I
Take him girl away from him, oh God
Can't believe I, him can't believe I
Take him girl away from him, oh God
