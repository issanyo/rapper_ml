(Intro)
Tell me why is you all in yo feelings?
You need to quit it
Tell me why is you all in yo feelings?

(Hook)
I don’t have feelin’s for none of my old bitches really no mo'
I don’t have feelin’s for none of my old bitches really no mo'
Time and time again I tried it but it neva worked
All it ever did was somebody gettin' hurt
Tell me why is you all in yo feelings?
Girl, you need to quit it
Tell me why is you all in yo feelings?
It been a minute
If you can’t respect what I say then baby then you really gotta let it go
I’m out on that money, I’m chasin' paper, baby, that is really all I know
Tell me why is you all in yo feelings?

(Verse: Cap 1)
No time for games, I’m not tryna play with ya
Didn’t get the picture, hopin' I miss her
Said she lonely, reminiscin' on liquor
She gone ‘I miss ya'
That’s what she feelin’, need to hit the phone
That’s what she wantin', come and get it on
No strings attatched she leavin' in the morn'
She say I’m wrong (‘nigga, you are wrong!’)
She said I’m steady playn with her feelin'
She tell me one day nigga you gon' feel it
God know she miss me and know that I did it
I sent yo bitch home
I told her pin' the politic my mind on that mula
Told her she fine but her gf is cutter
The piness got the work up on that ruler

(Hook)
I don’t have feelin’s for none of my old bitches really no mo'
I don’t have feelin’s for none of my old bitches really no mo'
Time and time again I tried it but it neva worked
All it ever did was somebody gettin' hurt
Tell me why is you all in yo feelings?
Girl, you need to quit it
Tell me why is you all in yo feelings?

(Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign)
Tell me, why you wanna go and do that? Why?
Why you tellin' other bitches I’m the man when you know I’m just the nigga? Girl
Hatin' on a player, I ain’t never play no games witcha
Mad at a nigga, I ain’t never let you take no pictures, no
Heard you fuckin' on a homie, damn, these bitches will do anything to hurt you
Players only live once, I seen some shit I [?]
Nigga found out I fucked his bitch and now the nigga wanna kill me
Cause it's money over bitches, handbroke niggas, I ain’t got no feelings

(Verse 3: Cap 1)
No time for talkin', all that shit do make it feel personal
Cross a few words or two just like I kinda do
Drop the top and pull up in my convertible
No time for the feelins, I move through the city, no ceilin'
She callin' pack to pack she tryna get with me
Told her I’m busy, I’m busy busy my kinda business
How’d ya want 100 50 or the 20s?
How’d ya want money? More than I can count em
How’d ya want keep that coola>? Smoke a pound
I got a 4 full o' bitches call and textin' me
Me talkin' bout how they was ?
I got some new women waitin' with anticipation
Can’t wait till I get to they town
Told em I’m gone

(Hook)
