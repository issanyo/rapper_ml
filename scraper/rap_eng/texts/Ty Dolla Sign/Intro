[Intro]
Today I woke up by the shore
Waves like heads with brushes stroked forward
On a canvas blank in the memories washed away by the tides..
She rides..
Back and forth, as I stroke back and forth
In mornings where window views make sight of her freedom coming true
I paint, she walks my window pain, touching all her pain
I write metaphors for her legs, spread like wings
I lay similes on her breast
Living a dream, hope out of her eyes shining beams
Lights bright stars on nights we can't remember
I kiss her forehead, before head just so breakfast has it's warning
On these mornings by the shore, scored by the sounds played in the violins of her hair blew by shallow fears
Swallows prides, I see the paintings of her footprints on the kitchen floor
And finds she lives in the Beach House.. 2
