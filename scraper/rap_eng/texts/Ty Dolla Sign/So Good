Don't listen to your friends shorty (don't listen to 'em)
They gon' tell you that I'm no good (uh, uh)
That's because they want me too and them hoes should (right)
I'm a real one them other niggas kosher (ha, ha)
I got drive like a chauffer, sending hits like Sosa (blah)
Ooh, a nigga flyer than a plane
Don't listen to them niggas they be lyin' with them games
Hunnid thou' for the wrist game and it's plain jane, yeah
When I fall through, you're the only I call to
Come through lemme show you what this tongue do
Benihana dates play with sticks like it's Kung Fu
Private jet, breakfast if it's late you get lunch too

Your friends passed up on me that's their first mistake (sheesh)
You ain't sleep on your chains girl you beat the cake (beat the cake)
Ain't gon' lie 'cause I beat it too (beat it too)
Now they see you on the 'gram flexin' bad (flex), got 'em [?] too
But it's cool long as they don't mess with your man
They see them vacation pics, how you flex with your man
I remember you tellin' me how you ex was a fan
But now he hatin' on me too, I ain't stressin' that man
But it's so good, I swear to God girl it's so good
Talkin' all classy when your ass know you're so hood (you know it)
Nails did, hair did and your toes good
But it ain't about the look shorty 'cause you're so good

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I need it right away (woah)
When I want it bring it right away (yeah)
And it's so good when I stay in it 'til we sober (sober)
Baby right away you the only I hit when I'm around the way (way)
'Cause it's so good when I stay in it 'til we sober
