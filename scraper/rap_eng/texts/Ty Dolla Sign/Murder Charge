[Intro: Verse Simmonds]
I put that on my momma
She look just like Rihanna
Nobody say a word
It's bloody bloody murder

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign & Verse Simmonds]
Pull up with the movements and murda murda
Diamonds stay flashing on 'em, murda murda
911 triple dashing on 'em, murda murda
Lil baby got an ass on her, murda murda
She just hit the club and caught a murder charge
She just hit the club and caught a murder charge
She just hit the club and caught a murder charge
She just hit the club and caught a murder charge

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I just cashed out with my day one
I just put a bezel on my 41
Sippin' red rum, bitch, murda murda
I just fucked your bitch at the Fat Burger

[Verse 2: Verse Simmonds]
I walked around with a check on my neck
I took your bitch and you can't get her back
I'm not the type of dog chasin' a cat
I guess that I'm too fuckin' lazy for that
She happy that she fucked a nigga famous
She heard I got a temper and I'm dangerous
Is that pussy mine? Don't you lie to me
If you let me cut, you hit the lottery

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign & Verse Simmonds]
Pull up with the movements and murda murda
Diamonds stay flashing on 'em, murda murda
911 triple dashing on 'em, murda murda
Lil baby got an ass on her, murda murda
She just hit the club and caught a murder charge
She just hit the club and caught a murder charge
She just hit the club and caught a murder charge
She just hit the club and caught a murder charge

[Verse 3: Verse Simmonds & Ty Dolla $ign]
In the back seat of that black Suburban
Foggin' up the windows, hit it missionary
Yeah, all black lam to the cementary
Last nigga died trying to flex on me
Stack that money up in large amounts
Took the drug, it took all day to flush it out
You ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas, what you talkin' 'bout?
It's a murder on the scene when we steppin' out

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign & Verse Simmonds]
Pull up with the movements and murda murda
Diamonds stay flashing on 'em, murda murda
911 triple dashing on 'em, murda murda
Lil baby got an ass on her, murda murda
She just hit the club and caught a murder charge
She just hit the club and caught a murder charge
She just hit the club and caught a murder charge
She just hit the club and caught a murder charge

[Outro: Verse Simmonds]
I put that on my momma
She look just like Rihanna
Nobody say a word
It's bloody bloody murder
