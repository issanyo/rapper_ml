[Verse 1]
Hey, I like the skinny with a whole lot of ass
She like the man with a whole lot of cash
She said her ex man treated her bad
I said I don't wanna hear about your past, hmmm
First night we met she let me smash
It was the best fucking sex she ever had
Now she wanna introduce me to her dad
I said hold up girl, you're moving too fast!

[Hook]
Said hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, let me re-evaluate
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Girl, let's take it slow, take it slow
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Baby, I think we should take it slow, slow
I knew I need more time to get to know you, oh

[Verse 2]
Keep her socks on every time we fucked
She tried to tongue kiss a nigga in the club
I said hold on, girl, you're doing too much
You know I got them cameras on us
Uh, first mistake I made, I eat her raw
I got the biggest fucking dick she ever saw
I gotta trip her when I don't answer her calls
I told her trip on me again, I'll let you fall!

[Hook]
