[Hook]
She only callin' when she want the juice
Only callin' when I bust a move
Young nigga broke all the rules
All these hoes actin' brand new
Started off with a dime
Now everywhere I go, I shine
All these bitches wanna ride
But really, I ain't got the time
She only call me when she want the juice
Only call me when she want the juice
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah
Only call me when she want the juice
That's what she do, that's what she do
No, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
I was so low
Had no one to call on
Then you hit my phone up
How you get my number?
Callin' me, see, I got my cake up
Young niggas came up
And how you get my number?

[Bridge]
They doubted me and now she want my energy
We ain't got no chemistry but I still might fuck though
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know your type girl, I know your type
You the type that wanna shine
You the type that want that life
Girl get up out my life

[Hook]
She only callin' when she want the juice
Only callin' when I bust a move
Young nigga broke all the rules
All these hoes actin' brand new

All these bitches wanna ride
But really, I ain't got the time

[Verse 2]
She texts me
Sittin' in the living room
She's seen all my interviews
She loves givin' headlines like I'm breaking news
So often
I can see she loves me
I'm just not that into you
Girl, come let me fuck, I fix your attitude
