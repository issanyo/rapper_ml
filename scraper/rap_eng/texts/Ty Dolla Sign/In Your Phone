[Intro]
Hahaha
Dun De-e-e-e-al

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
You always in your phone (phone)
I feel like you do me wrong (wrong)
You always in your phone (phone)
I feel like you do me wrong
You always in your phone (phone)
I feel like you do me wrong (do you wrong)
You always in your phone (oh)
I feel like you do me wrong (do you wrong)

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Tell me what you're waiting for
You wanna jump in the 'Rari
Show me your passport
But you be hiding your past calls
You be all on my nerves
But your love is the best
But you already do more
But I want you to say less
Chic-chic boom, too many problems
You been doing, too many wild nights
Yeah, sometimes you are a challenge
I wanna even the score
I want my raise

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Lauren Jauregui]
You always in your phone
I feel like you do me wrong
You always in your phone
I feel like you do me wrong
You always in your phone
I feel like you do me wrong
You always in your phone
I feel like you do me wrong (do you wrong)

[Verse 2: Lauren Jauregui]
Ch-chicks on you, too many of them
When I’m in the room, I feel their eyes on me
Got some nerve saying I’m the challenge
But I know, I know that you know, I’ve been damaged
You be all nerves, and your love is the best
But I get so in my head when you keep shit to yourself
Why you always in your phone? Can’t you talk to me?
‘Cause I know that you need it more than not to squeal, I can’t ignore

[Chorus: Lauren Jauregui + Ty Dolla $ign]
You always in your phone
I feel like you do me wrong
You always in your phone
I feel like you do me wrong
You always in your phone
I feel like you do me wrong
You always in your phone
I feel like you do me wrong
