[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
You know it ain't shit to a boss
Pull up on you with the top off
She give me top with the top off
Riding down the motherfucking boulevard
I'm a motherfucking superstar
In the all white double R
Smoking weed in the back seat
Riding round with a fat heat
Hoes gon' choose niggas like me
Gon' win, niggas like you gon' lose
Gone off the juice, my bitch take a Perc and a Xan
First class flight to Japan, it ain't nothing
You came from nothing to something
All we ever do is get money
All we ever do is get money

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
You know it ain't shit to a boss
Ain't shit to a boss, girl, you know it ain't shit to a boss
You know it ain't shit to a boss
Ain't shit to a boss, girl, you know it ain't shit to a boss
You know it ain't shit to a boss
Ain't shit to a boss, girl, you know it ain't shit to a boss
You know it ain't shit to a boss
Ain't shit to a boss, girl, you know it ain't shit to a boss

[Verse 2: Joe Moses]
Independent and still winning, my gang in effect
I'm a all out boss, sitting with a new BMF
I yell free Big Meech like my nigga DaVinci
I spend a cheque in New York, I had the purchase at 'vinchy
Fly my bitches from Bompton and make 'em land in Boston
Threw my Rollie a party, them diamonds keep on bouncing
Them niggas keep on flossing, what you expect from the bottom?
When you come from nothing, that's how your bet gon' be start you
I do it big like Biggie, what's present
And all my niggas is present
My nigga, I stay with the weapon
And this gun ain't here for the flexing
We really shoot shit, difference is, you don't do shit
Woop too, this the new shit
We really shoot shit, difference is, you don't do shit
Woop too, this the new shit, bitch

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
You know it ain't shit to a boss
Ain't shit to a boss, girl, you know it ain't shit to a boss
You know it ain't shit to a boss
Ain't shit to a boss, girl, you know it ain't shit to a boss
You know it ain't shit to a boss
Ain't shit to a boss, girl, you know it ain't shit to a boss
You know it ain't shit to a boss
Ain't shit to a boss, girl, you know it ain't shit to a boss
