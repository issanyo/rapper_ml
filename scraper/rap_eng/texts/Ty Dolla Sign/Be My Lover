Oh, so I guess you ain't planning on seeing me before you left

[Verse 3: Mila J]
Not a [?]
Not in control now
Good thing that you know I'm on the road now
Tryna bring it to the last show that was sold out
I gotta run around ya
Moving it's [?] yeah
Don't wanna put it down on you
But I'm on that boss shit now
I wanna put it down for my city
I wanna put it down for my city
I wanna roll around popping pilly
Riding in a drop top, making call
