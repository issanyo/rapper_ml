Hook [Mary singing with words by Black Star]
Yes you are (Sometimes you just meet someone and you just completely...)
You're so beautiful
Here we go... come on
Absolutely fantastic, Now you're near
Absolutely fantastic, In my life
Fantastic, All my fears
Fantastic, Beautiful
Fantastic, Come to me
Fantastic, Now I am
Fantastic, Someone watching over me Fantastic

[Mos Def]
I dreamt that I could paint you with words
But there were no colors bright enough
Black or white enough
Blue or green enough, it didn't mean enough
You are the star that touched the earth
Shine bright for all eyes to see
Radiate and touched me
Now I'm shining like you do
It was dim before I knew you
Bright light for weeping eyes to get used to
Trust who? That's some shit to adjust to
Soon as you relax, they ease back and cold bust you
Love murdered in Brooklyn, sound the alarm
But you said remain calm, my passion is unarmed
I tried to practice my war like tactics
But in the clutch of your touch, my armor just collapses
Sun's bliss breeds obliviousness
So recollect sweet breath still wet on my lips
My prayer's this: Go protect my beloved and keep her covered From the valley to the summer like the land undiscovered
(like the stars)

[Mary]
Beautiful, now you're near in my life all my fear
Beautiful, come to me, now I am, someone watching over me
[Black Star]
Like the stars outnumbered, you are so beautiful
I do all my best so I could be true to you
Ain't nothing in this word that I wouldn't do for you
?? everything usual
Like the stars outnumbered, you are so beautiful
Where I stand, understand who I am, that makes me a man

[Talib Kweli]
You know what, they say that beauty's in the eye of the beholder
So I use my third, and now I love solid like a boulder
Want to be with you as I get older
And that's my word, sure as I stand on my ancestors' shoulders
You see through my drama and my world like a stage
Not the same years but living in the same age
Just the quality, not the quantity
Follow me, definitely
Far from probably, got to be
You and me, beautifully, thick like pieces of the man I used to be
Now I'm back cause of what you do to me
You like my reflection, better half to my whole
Like lyrics to the beat, you're the mate for my soul
The breath for my life, my sister and my lover
Used to have cold feet, now you the one under my covers
I can't ignore your aura but it grabbed me by the hand
Like the moon pulled the tide and the tide pulled the sand

[Hook]
Go ahead, Mary, baby, sing your song
Oh, so beautiful
That dream that it would be so beautiful
I wanna say that I love you
All the love you give, all the love you give to me
All my days and nights were lonely
And it's so beautiful
And now I have a friend that I can talk to, yeah
Boy, you're so beautiful

[Mos Def and Kweli be switching back and forth like a crossfader]
Because you're fruitful, beautiful
Smart, lovable, huggable, doable like art
Suitable to be part of the cosmos
With my eyes closed, I see you clearly
Combined lifetimes with like minds, your lovelight shines
Bright the apple of my eyesight
The tender kiss that whets my appetite
My mighty Aphrodite, the flame that ignite me
Your name just excite me
Your eyes so alive they aright me
Cause you are so beautiful
You don't even know the length I would go
To make absolutely sho' you is respected and protected
And never neglected, I hope my prayers is accepted
That you always will be watched over
And never rocked over
And if you need me to, I'll stop over
To check on you, I'd never jet on you
I know a lot of foolish cats that slept on you
But what I'm gonna do is be totally committed
If you need me I'll be hotter than the New York Mennen
With a hundred percentage, from the start to the finish
Cause the vibe you give leave me so replenished
It's a new beginning, this is serious business
Got my heart and soul in it
It's the way that I'm living
Let it be known that I'm devoted, it's always going to prevail
The newly risen, truely living universal for real
It's like that y'all, and ya don't stop

[Mary]
You're the only love I know, Beautiful
You're the only love that knows, Beautiful
You're the reason why I live, Beautiful
You're the reason why I want to give you everything, Beautiful

...Since you came into my life
