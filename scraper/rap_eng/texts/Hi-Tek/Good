[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
I wanna get away, I wanna disappear
To somewhere where the sun is shining and the water's clear
Nobody talking bullshit in my ear
Just lots of cheery people drinking beer
On the coast and the dearest could be near
And lots of smiley faces, cocktails and chasers
Penthouses in high places
No problem, hate you, just wakin, I'm bakin for my delevation
Love makin the penetration
The kind of vacation that I wanna be taking
I just wanna see some palm trees and take shopping sprees
If I'm lacking what I see I'm copping or dropping Ps
No stopping me whilst looking for investments on properties
Some hotties don't wanna please
Some beaches with cool breezes â€“ that's what I need
Strike up a conversation
No complication, no confrontation
Nobody tryna get up off they station
Just a lot of rehabilitation, no hesitation
Every day is just one big celebration

[Bridge: Angel]
You know I gotta think I'm fly girl
Even when I put your smiles up girl
We just tryna kill some time ah
Something kinda like fine wine
See you ain't gotta see my shine now girl
Promising to multiply it girl
I ain't gotta act all wild, I'm good
You already know my style

[Hook: Angel]
(Now everybody get your hands up high)
We'll have a real good time
Real good time
We're gonna feel so fine
(Get your hands up high)
Feel so alive
We'll have a real good time
Real good time
We're gonna feel so fine
If you're runnin back to bed let me know that we can get it right

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
Fresh fruit, fresh juice, vitamin boost
I'm looser than a goose, I'm not a recluse
I'm socializing, looking over the horizon, feeling so alive
I'm mesmerized, I'm stopping over the ocean ready to take a dive
Or take five and get back, can sit back
I'm fresher than a Tic-Tac with nothing else to distract me
Exactly what the fuck to all the refs, I'm being away in the corner
Do I drop a form or taking a flight?
You with? It will be warmer
Now it's hotter than the sauna, 2 block of water
And just to keep me cool
I'm getting a massage in my quarters, feeling like a moola
All I need in comfort me, now girl what's the stop with me?
Then hit the time and get her back, eat or munch with me
When in doubt we'll keep it moving
Pay the bill and see a movie
After that we'll hit the club and keep it super groovy
Feelin kinda woozy cause of the liquid we're abusing
Boy it's really quite amusing, plus we're vibing with the music
