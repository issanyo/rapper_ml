[Intro]
Yes yes yes yes
(Whoo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-WHOO!)

Light up the sky like the 4th of July
Everything in this life son, they've got two sides
It's part one (part one) part two (part two)
Get together with my crew, and we gon' do
Whatever we've got to do, uh-huh-UH!
Feast for Hi-Teknological, neurological
It's unstoppable, check it out..

[Verse 1]
I'm fantastic, FURIOUS like the Five from B'lawn
Brooklyn phenom'
Diss all peons, flow for eons
Mos Def is beyond, in fact most cats can agree on
Cause we on the same frequency, if not
Change your dial and get on it, I flip on this here beat
Then the re-bonics keep heat like, Hamid's weed speech
Hit the deep street sonnets, who want it?
Hoppin dancin so sonic, you need tonics
Don't get yours from your schoolboy comets, all blazin
On your man chronic, I twist the hard caps back
To blue bonnets, I repeat -- WHO WANT IT?
Daytime on the list of time on the tradition, of combustion
Ignition, propulsion, put MC's on expulsion
The principle, YOUR academics inadmissiable
You're indefensible, my style is so comprehensible
Cats take it to heart like a ventricle
You temporary like a weather pattern
Forgot I'm like you never happened
Don't never say whatever happened to Mos?
My light shine boast from the East to the Left Coast..
North and South both, cause it sound DOPE
Boy your boy sound CHOKED with the next man's style
Between your teeth tongue and throat like *SOUND EFFECT*
Got to wash your mouth out with soap
My penstroke, is leavin other men broke
What I invoke is never asleep, ever woke
It controls the soul of your foes and kinfolk
Maintainin my scope from beginnin to end quote
Like ba-biti-dabi-dida-da-dah-dah
Pretty High Noon riders get clipped and shot down
Reach behind, Teknological, neurological
Unstoppable, title wave in this shit, we powerful

[Hook]
Now raise your hands in the air now everybody get with it
The Universal, Magnetically
B-Boy Scientific, you don't stop
It go ON to the rhythm you don't, bust it!
So raise your hands in the air now everybody get with it
The Universal, Magnetically

You see I'm comin to the party in the b-boy stance
I rock on the mic.. on the mic, yo

[Verse 2]
Son it's in my chromosomes to rock this, I got this
Watch this! Assemble mo' raps, tap your pockets
Knock this, stimulate nerve ends and shock wrists
Smart art breakin apart hearts in darkness
Down for the longest, son peep the songlist
Radiate enormous, pure peak performance
Vocal chords the strongest, acapella or cordless
Hit town, draw crowds like space shuttle launches
WHOO! How Def flow -- we gone and
Brooklyn New York make the world moonwalk like John Glenn
Son I'm sendin it out, for the short to long haul
Earth sky, left right inbetween it and all y'all

[Hook]
Now raise your hands in the air now everybody get with it
The Universal, Magnetically
B-Boy Scientific, you don't stop
It go ON to the rhythm you don't, bust it!
So raise your hands in the air everybody get with it
The Universal, Magnetically
B-Boy Scientific, you don't stop
You see I'm comin to the party in the b-boy stance
I rock on the mic make your girl wanna dance
Fly like a dove, that come from above
From rockin on the mic and you can call me Mos Love
