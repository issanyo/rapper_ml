[Intro: Jonell]
Yeah-huh, yeah-huh, (yeah, yeah), ohh

[Verse 1: Jonell]
I try and I try to stop the forces that go round in my head and I
Thought you were the one to understand me
You turned my darkness towards the light
But once again you touched my hopes to pain
My soul's the same, my tears start flitting in the rain
I'm fallin' again... fallin' again...

[Chorus: Jonell]
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!

[Verse 2: Jonell]
If you don't understand where I'm comin' from
Then my heart is tellin' me you're not the one
All the games you played and now you lied
You're not the one, for me no more so baby bye bye
Pack yo' bags and get to steppin'
You got to let it go you need to stop trippin'
I hope you don't think I'll let you back in
Cause youse, a, fool

[Chorus: Jonell]
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!

[Bridge: Jonell]
It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain
To-day I made up my mind, to get away
Every-day, I sit and pray, everyday, every-day
To-day I made up my mind, to get away
Every-day, I sit and pray, everyday, every-day

[Chorus: Jonell]
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!

[Outro: Jonell]
Every-day, every (round and around we go)
To get away, away (round and around we go)
Hi-Tek (round and around we go)
Round and round, round and round (round and around we go)
We go round, and, round
We go in-side-out (round and around we go)
We go back, and, forth
We go round, and round (round and around we go)
(Did you hear me?)
