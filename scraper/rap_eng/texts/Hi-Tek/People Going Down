[Hook: singers]
Time to change your way, people act cra-zay
Gotta face it now, people going down
Children running wild, running with the crowd
Gotta face it now, people going down

[Willie Band Cottrell]
Cra-zayyyyyyyyyyyy, and it's all been a part of me
Every day, every year, crazy things, is all I hear
Everyyyyyyyyyyyyday, same ol' thang
And it's time to get over, get over

[Hook]

[Singers]
People going down {*4X*}
