[Intro]
B.E. got me on this old school shiiiit
Let me show you what I can do
I already got you rocking to

[Verse 1]
Feeling like that nigga obama
Bombing these dudes osama
The irony that contradiction fits the description
Of how I murder tracks terrorism
I tell em that and get little skepticism
Dead legends posses me, I need an exorcism
To get rid of this talent that turns dudes into casper
Is that what they seek after?
Other rappers lyrics seek laughter
It's a haha to nigga that not I
Weight up like popeye
My noodle can doodle boo boo that makes female poodles toodles
They scribble dribble that does little they mind simple
My rhymes cripple?
Maybe, does slim shady rap greatly? (Duh)
Do I make ladies do 180's? Daily
And everything is gravy
Even when the lames throw shade I'm not fazed cuz they gaze just relays
Off the specs, it keeps em in check like bitch behave
Do you see yourself?
You look foolish talking about the coolest like I don't do this
And this is where the hook would be if I thought of one
Serving dope bars like y'all ordered em
Homie was confused, he almost tried snorting em
Flow is foreign, they almost tried deporting him
Damn so extra terrestrial
The game is like a sport, they ain't really contesting though
Party in my pants, yeah it's a fucking festival
Only for ladies rank 7 and up like the soda
I get in the denim and bend them positions like girl get yo physician (ha)
I guess it's fuck me at your own risk
Listeners fuck with me at no risk
To the ones who don't listen a tsk tsk
But forgiveness, I'm gifted you witness endless effortless da business lyrics
Leaving beats defenseless with fitness bars til I'm finished
Now end this
