Intro: you don't know
What we go through
So I'm singin this song for you

Verse: 1:{meelah}
Ain't got no time to play around
It ain't about just hangin out
I got so much more to do
It ain't worth bein with you

Chorus: some people think they wanna live this life
They see the fame but they don't know the price
It ain't that easy
I need you to feel me
Reality's of A star

Verse: 2:{Irish}
I'm staying focused on myself, hey
Ain't gotta please nobody else, uhh
Got to do what's best for me
That's the way it has to be, baby

Chorus: again
Intro: again

Chorus: again
