Alright, yo

(Verse 1)
Hazardous, the catalyst for damaging the glamorous, the pacifists are acting shit, can't pass to match the manuscript
Medusa dropping on ya, stone to show off my persona, acoustic nuisance with aloofness to medulla oblongata got ta
Go, down to Nevada, tomorrow, find John Connor and blow his brains like propane, Kurt Cobain from Nirvana
I go for beef like piranha, kabana, proper its Sparta , but part of its art, you smell my fucking farts in the dark it's an honor
Horribly the odyssey, is hard to see iconicly, because Socrates philosophies get lost in lost commodities
And honestly, I drop on beats like nuclear economies; apologies are served when the verse is burnt in third degrees
Absurdity is circling concerning certain stern Mcs, and mercifully I'll murder thee faster than burb infirmaries
Refer to me as King, (bling) ...working for eternity, and burn a weed to supersede my curse is slowly surfacing
A Circus freak, you’ve heard of me? Certainly, I serve defeat, and learn to murder meat when I yearn to turn you vertically
Persecute the words to speak, and turn the key for burglary, you need to steal some solar flare, I'm hot like fuckin Mercury
Casual, rapping erratic, tragic and acting ill, facts are still wack Jack, you’re fragile as a daffodil
Man will kill, many men, many fucking many men, beheading in a sentence to send em’ off of their present tense
Innocence, is in its sense, in its own fucking inner sense, because it depends on what your sense spends on all its messages
A pessimist confess to this that life is never endless in the sense that residents keep coming like my fucking rent is kid
Ever since my pencil grip was tighter then my next to Kin, I've caught easy money, like a honey up in Centerlink
Your best to think my metaphors will better yours and mess your think, I'll walk into a cop house with a boar and I'll arrest a pig
Censorship, should sail its ship to a place of blatant negligence, because in defensive, it's fake like the fake in Katy Perry’s breasts
Laid to rest, hex every parade of plague plagiarists, because I ain't pacing boy, I'll run you down like a train descends
I’m a rapper in success, and you’re rabbit in suspense, you think you’re big bwoy now because you’re nappy with the dreads
You can slap me till I'm dead, fuck, I'm happy that it's said, you can’t buy a man’s respect when you sell out for the bread
Eat a pus, hide your fucking eyes like you’re Oedipus, it's leads to this, can you play the notes like a pianist
Egotist, feeds with the head of a penis (pen-a-nus), bleed to this, blood brothers unite in decree of it
Seize the seas like Caesar I’m seeing facetious in physique, fiends in me, I flip a hit to feed my upper scenery
See the dream, birds eye perspective in a record, the way flip my letters word is bond its esoteric
Hip hop is in a rut that is resurrected from the consumer who consumed its future like a vulture chewing at its wound
You sucked the fucking life out of the potential of the game, when your expectations placed chains and fame, over pain
Know the name, Novocain, motherfuckers all numbing out the pain, like a moth to a flame you endange your own life
Reconnaissance is prosperous, anonymously ominous, like Artemis I’m on point, asking me obviously
An act to show retardedness, I'm in the air like I'm phosphorus, the consequence of hollow tips, is infamous like Swastika’s
Insanity is leaking and I'm actively repeating when I wrap it and I breathe in, fucking gravity is leaving and
You're rapidly depleting, while these caskets are increasing, got you passively agreeing, that its anarchy I'm breathing


(Outro)
Im Out, ha
Big Ups to Hi-Tek
