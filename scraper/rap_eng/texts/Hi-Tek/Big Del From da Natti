Let 'em know how we do it down in the C.O
We 'bout to get the thang started
Know what I'm sayin'? The year 2000

I'm 'bout to let these muthafuckas know, Big D representin'
All the way from the C.O
Cinncinnati, Ohio - that's what it is
Ay yo I'm givin' some shout-outs to my kids
I'm just a real-ass nigga from the Natti I used to drive caddies
And used to be a Pimp daddy
And now I chill in the studio, roll wit' my niggas
And we sippin' on Henny though
Yeah, I like to smoke on the hydro
Go to the club, might pick up a freaky ho
Yeah, what's up my niggas? We doin' it like that
While we in the bank countin' figures
You know how we gettin' things started down here in the Natti
You know, Come down here you kick it with me, Big D
Y'know, ride out, get cloud out, smoked out, know what I'm sayin'
Get things poppin'
You know how we do it, got the forty fluid
Know what I'm sayin', yeah, yeah
