[Intro]

[Hook: Loyol]

I give it every minute and I give it every minute

I give it every second and I give it every second

Yeah I give it every third; yes I give it every third

Go and share what you heard, power is the word

Power is the word that I give every minute

Power is the word that I give every second

Power is the word that I deal on every third

Go and share what you heard, power is the word


[VERSE 1: Le CLeric]

Power in these beats keep flowing/ hope on these streets keeps glowing/

Support is growing/

Though these facetious cats are using music for the fame/

While I stats pronounce the name/

Blue lines on this page/ tools that encourage/

Channel power to your souls/ I saw you forage/

For some of that soul food/ you’re feeding on tofu? /

It’s time to power through, all the façade/

It’s time to power down, all that you heard/

You are powerful beyond what anyone can measure/

Pay no mind to any different anyone will tell you/

This music will re-charge you/

When you feel powerless, IT WILL RE-CHARGE YOU/

Let the trumpet guide you/ light the fuse inside you/

Let the rhyme provide you with that nutrient/

So you never will relent/

For freedom, for power, equality for ours/

We’re moving on further, look at the hour/

At the end of the day, we’re all standing on towers/


[Bridge]


[VERSE 2: Le Cleric]

Don’t let the power play ever distract you from the way/

On the path to greatness very many have yet strayed/

Hunger for power leaves many emaciated/

So the plot, concoct and they get inebriated/

They horde it/ Thinking that they own it or they bought it/

Treating it like its limited, they can’t afford it/

I’m honored/ to speak these words though I’m being modest/

The margin between those who know those who do not is enormous/

Knowledge is power, then why aren’t you bothered/

To amass as much, make sure you read these facts/

And Trust/

Alas, every single one of us will surpass all these barriers/

It’s not about harriers, Mercs or even Beemers/

I’m seeing much greener/

Shining lights much brighter, much brighter than off-the-coast beamers/



[Hook: Loyol]

I give it every minute and I give it every minute

I give it every second and I give it every second

Yeah I give it every third; yes I give it every third

Go and share what you heard, power is the word

Power is the word that I give every minute

Power is the word that I give every second

Power is the word that I deal on every third

Go and share what you heard, power is the word
