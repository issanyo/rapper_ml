I had a deja vu before laying this first line looking at this little speaker and pacing from no time
I can feel the devil hating but fuck him my soul shine and still them lil niggas dissing and making them boring rhymes
Laying em on the track like them shits was hotter than mine
Only in nightmares you niggas still call dreams
Doing this shit for who? Bitch Im doing this shit for me
Still doing this so all the lil niggas can sit and think
Was written wit the intention to vent
Predict all you want but you will be pissed once I hit you wit hits
A hundred of em the hundreds loved him and taught him his trips
So none above him, just come from nothing and turned it to gifts
You something somethings just run from love and relate to the bitch while I once was running 'til summer stuck em and I fell off my bike
The worst shit that they prolly did was jump some niggas and failed cuz they too frail or lack male from all the women intent
I got too much heart to deal wit u niggas all your lies
Came from concrete and shadows with open eyes
Pity you lame bitches downplaying cuz niggas realer dont speak to me never ever 3000 forever evers my niggas think
That Julian tryna be over all when I really just want the crown cuz I worked for it way too hard!
Believe that we'd all have so nigga we all have it
Fuck yo hacking my niggas too passionate for that action
Legit a king
Ceito a king, Sani a king and Fonz-E a king
Johnny a king and UG a king
All we breathe is the truth so give no fuck bout neat
Dont give no fuck bout trends you niggas bit off Me
Tired of niggas thinking just cuz I keep a Lo-Pro that somebody losing the flow or im scared that i ain't gon' blow thats never the case
I just had leeches reaching and feinding to see him just leave em but it Just deepened the meaning
Yurp

Its Julian...
