[Intro]
I love rapping
I love doing the shows, late night studio sessions
But
Getting home after them shits is a motherfucker
You ever tried to catch a cab in New York City?

[Verse]
It’s 2 AM and the rain’s coming down, and I’m beat – I just wanna go home
I just missed the last bus, the train ain’t running now – so here we go down this lonely road
That I’ve been down before, but here’s how it goes usually
I see an empty cab, he sees me, he’s off duty
Drives right past me, stop at the light
Just to turn his medallion on and pick up the white couple
Let’s not be hasty and say he’s racist
It’s late – and with my hoodie on, he can’t see faces
His safety comes first and although it’s raining
I’ll just uncover my head, and brace for the same shit
Now here comes another, I stick out my arm
Oh shit! He’s slowing down, I put on the charm
He rolls the window down, I smiled – he’s alarmed
He rolls with window up – and just like that – he’s gone
Now it’s 2:15, and the rain’s coming down, I’m exhausted – I wanna go home
You see everything’s closed and there’s no one around, here I go on this lonely road
Does anybody wanna help me get where I live
It’s a five-minute ride and I’m right over the bridge
You stop at the corner, I’ll hop in when you ain’t looking
And I don’t wanna hear “NO, I DON’T GO TO BROOKLYN”
But I should’ve known better, cause that’s just what he said
And as black as I am – that’s when I turn red
I ain’t say a word, he just froze up with fear
Well, if you ain’t gonna drive, then we’re gonna sit here
Cause I’m not getting out, you can call the police
He shut the ignition off and took out his keys
He turned around and said “YOU PEOPLE GIVE TOO MUCH PROBLEMS”
I’m trying to give him money, he thinks I’m trying to rob him
You’re judging off a skin color and where I live
But get offended if they call you a terrorist
Well you ain't Bin Laden, and my name ain’t Bishop
So do your job, start driving and don’t expect a tip
Cause it’s 2:45, and the rain’s coming down and I’m beat – I just wanna go home
Oh shit, my phone battery’s running out – here I go down this lonely road
