Dem smoke from the hookah. Man, look her
With a kiddo so little, but outside of that she is a looker
Same chick I used to chill with. Her bro who I was trill with
Same jacket from back at 'double eleven (2011)', I still fit it
Same I used to wear at Charles, drinking beer and shouting bars
Throwin bags of eggs threw the town, against the cars
The shit just ended scarred and it made me hella charred
Now I spend the day with music and they spend the day with dart
Reefer and beamer, believing a skeemer
Cheating a cheater, lean for a teener
Lean for the rest, six times three on her chest
What's so nice 'bout being the best or being the last

I be in a fest, my mind speaks with the past
I be in "Double O" or "K", that's the B and the west
Used to throw a 'double u (W)' like "Nothing new."
Now I just throw my middlefinger like "I don't fuck with you", but I do
Man, I miss your bruv and you
Watching anime, take a winner and you're making two
A demon is what I was made into
Buying my place to heaven is already late to do
So I just accept
That I'm gonna have to be in a place with my dad
I know he'll get there, I was born there so he left there
My bro used to take a 20 (â‚¬ 20,-) from his mom, the one with red hear
The one with a drum, the one with a broken leg
The one with the hoes and the one that saw me go off track
Now that one isn't going, his personality from then is gone
And if you'd ask me what makes me happy, I would say a song

Used to play for fun because of the town, for sure
0-2-5-2, I can't count no more. (2x)

The sky keep on sinking, cuz daddy's long gone
All I did in two years, I know it's all wrong
Momma used to listen '2 triple o (2000)' songs
That I'm off to heaven, there's really no chance

But if it happens I will pray
To Him and thank Him for every day
Ones from the past and the ones on the way
But I'll faithfully follow mom if she can't stay

[Hook, sorta]
Used to play outside. Used to not stress
Used to draw manga's and I used to be the best I could ever be (2x)
