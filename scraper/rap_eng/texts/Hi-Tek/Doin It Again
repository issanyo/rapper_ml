We so hot, we so hot baby
Everywhere we go we shutting down the spot baby
Got them bottles in the air like yeah
Everybody put your hands up wave them like you don't care (hey! hey!)
Wave them like you don't care (hey! hey!)
Wave them like you don't care (yeah)
We doing it again (you remember, you remember)
You know we doing it again (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Back at it
Open a door for me while I go into another tax bracket
See you clown like I'm laying up in a craftmatic
And choke the street till they diagnose them as asthmatic
So charismatic
I light the room up till the bomb blocks cause a gang of traffic
And yes I'm doing it again in case you decide to ask it
Another heated debate to people when I bang the classic
And swagger to death I tried to warn them
Until we got they back on the fence I got it for them
This shit ain't making no sense prepare nigga
Witnessing the greatest in the flesh we right here nigga

[Verse 2: Reek the Villain]
Listen, uh
These clown niggas run around with they foolish acts
Talking that trash shit knowing they ain't moving packs
As far as killing bitches I got Freddy Krueger stats
I should be the mascot for Cheetos I'm the coolest cat
Little fart niggas thats the shit I don't like
If it ain't as good as daughter I bet I won't wife
I'll just beat up the pussy and leave it all nice
One time is for the money so I never bone twice
I was good in the hood with a Glock boy
My kitchen was the studio in them rock boys
Was making music and that booth was the pot boy
Now I tour with Bust and see 55 with stock boy

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Hmm
Watch me do it
And display it in such a way where I can limit it all Versace stupid
Stepping up in the spot you know you must salute it
And I suggest you humble yourself and watch me student
The undisputed (YMCMB)
Have me making a more dangerous movement
See now we hang our coats to that
Sit at the round table glasses in rows and we making a toast to that
Some of these niggas think that they hot that's in the present nigga
The problem is that I'm hot and I'm a legend nigga
The problem is that I got only a second nigga
See this alliance exposed a couple of frightful niggas
