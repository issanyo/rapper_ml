Shout out to Hi-Tek
One time to Kweli
We gonna have a little fun with this one

[Chorus: Heather Victoria]
Let’s celebrate, we made it through another day let’s party
Put your worries away, come and grab another drink, let’s party
Relax your mind, it’s alright to unwind
We’re tearin’ up the floor tonight
The floor, tonight
The floor, tonight

[Verse 1: Heather Victoria]
Just got paid and ready to party
Had a long week need to get some stress off me
So I call my girls told ‘em all to get ready
Cause we out tonight
You know whatever I wear I bet you’ll wanna cop it
Try to duplicate but baby, you better stop it
Party’s round the way and baby, I’m gonna rock it
All night
Cause there’s no way I’m in the house tonight
And there’s no way we’re not steppin’ out tonight
Cause it’s the weekend get up with your girlfriends
And tell them we’re gonna party

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Sean Boog]
Step in the room, ready for the boom
Midnight ready to rock like it’s high noon
George Cloon, with the full room women
Bouncin’ like switches, head hips over dickless
Let’s go fishing, Ciroc with the [?]
Adults tryna play like kids on the recess
Class out it’s the weekend, mash out
This is party time and we lookin’ for the fast route

[Verse 3: Big Remo]
Clean on the inside, mean in my Bent ride
She know this guy is hotter than fish fry
Yea mami it’s not dressed so I hit top
Towards where you at it’s a party and the chicks fly
Took her by the wrist, baby let’s get lost
Two shots, mixed drinks, stumbled to the car
Ma you with the north side goon from the trade
If you keep it under wraps (cause we like to party)

[Chorus]
