Oh yeah

Gangstas stay flawsin'
Aftermath stay bumpin'
Happiness and lovin'
All my niggas know
Ain't no frontin'
This pussy they wantin'
In need of good lovin'
Shaunta trying to hook up tonight for sho'

Let's go somewhere where we can hook up tonight
Shaunta shit tight like Shaunta on the mike
Hard dick shit, Shaunta right on site, shit
Shaunta got weed, I just need a light
Hit it right 'cuz I ain't the quiet type
Or polite, be a man, nigga
I don't fuck wit mice
Whipped cream and a bucket of ice
Let's get between the sheets and fight
I'm tryna enjoy my life
I ain't tryna be your wife
I'm tryna fuck and catch this flight
Gotta be in Vegas by the end of the night
Bust nuts and stay hard
Them the type of niggas I like
I fuck wit G's 'cuz squares don't be hitting it right
Shrimp dick shit
I might as well fuck wit a dyke
Can't stand a nigga that bark loud and don't bite
Here's the advice

Gangstas stay flawsin'
Aftermath stay bumpin'
Happiness and lovin'
All my niggas know
Ain't no frontin'
This pussy they wantin'
In need of good lovin'
Shaunta trying to hook up tonight for sho'

Verse 2
Shaunta, shit bomb
You ain't know
Why you think the bomb squad kicked in the door
I'm about to explode on daddy long stroke relationship
Strictly sexual
Limp dick should get their shit fixed or stay at home
I throw bows, you box shit
Throw Shaunta some low blows
I need to know your penal codes
Little dicks should be on house arrest and parole
Him violated for even speaking to hoes
I choose, I don't get chose
Relax, take of your clothes
My pussy's auto-phobic, she hates to be alone
I'm tryna work up a sweat
Can't you see I'm in the zone
Don't worry bout me 'cuz I can hold my own
And if you ain't tryna fuck
Then nigga what you came here for

Gangstas stay flawsin'
Aftermath stay bumpin'
Happiness and lovin'
All my niggas know
Ain't no frontin'
This pussy they wantin'
In need of good lovin'
Shaunta trying to hook up tonight for sho'

Like me, dark meat
Nigga, just bring the heat
Learn to fuck for 8 days a week
Instead of always licking the peach
Pussy pop be having you
Jerking your feet, gritting your teeth
Shaunta do things that only niggas dream
Ecstasy in the week
Nigga please
Most of y'all can't fuck with me

Gangstas stay flawsin'
Aftermath stay bumpin'
Happiness and lovin'
All my niggas know
Ain't no frontin'
This pussy they wantin'
In need of good lovin'
Shaunta trying to hook up tonight for sho'
