[Son Anthony]
Present to me a semblance of a lesser and I'll do my best to fix it if it's truly altruistic
Write when trouble heads. I ink it
Like a shovel I can dig it
Sink the ship that infiltrates the waves I made for fish to swim in
So precocious as a kitten til I blossomed into violets
Far away from that of lions. Let this pilot my retirement
Firing squads' confident they got my in vitals
But their riffles weren't quick enough to take away my title
Time to break away from spiteful cos I fear I cannot carry it
Son of the silent age is being wheeled off in his chariot
Motives were most nefarious when fending off the various
Barriers up ahead
Yeah, I rock for the proletariat
My Navi fairy taught me how to navigate from danger
If its frolicking through daises that helps gravitate toward angels
Then I'll follow through and won't tap A to pass advice
Sometimes I fear that happiness will bastardize that which I write
Though it might mitigate this life and maybe fulfill it
Sip my drink before I move onto the floor so I don't spill it
Like my guts over a beat where I prioritize to kill it
Built these walls around my ego and these lyrics are a drill bit
To take a peek to see preposterous angst
As the conduit takes my little toy boat to the banks
When I put it in that stream I dreamed of constable rank
Though as of late been feeling like the last lobster in the tank
De La taught me not to speak about my bilious raps
Or I will self induce a billion lashes to my back
As a result of that
Catapult myself over your wall then sprawl out to reside there
I'm the 8 ball of the billiards

[Q No Rap Name]
You mother fuckers can't be serious
Interfering with this will get split like a Cesarean section
