[Hook: Dion]
Got to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
If you got it, I'm gone take it
If you're in it, you're coming with me
Bench warmers, get no playing time
No sleeping til I cross the line, I'm running

[Verse 1: The Game]
With 99 miles left, on the Avis rental car
Blowing horns like Miles Davis
At the pearly gate, God let me in
Give me a room by Aaliyah with ESPN
I know I got more sins than two lesbians
Been back and forth across the border like Mexicans
But I'm running like New York pedestrians
Trying not to scuff my Nike Air checks again
It's funny how niggas be the best of friends
And fall out over pussy and wanna dead they man
One of my niggas in the grave the other one in the pen
She fucking my enemies inside my homeboys Benz
Now she begging God's mercy cause she ain't listen to Nas
And never heard about Ike and the Iverson jersey
He got a cousin named Jayceon that rock the Gary Payton
Now the same trifling bitch is a HIV patient, true story

[Hook: Dion]
Got to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
If you got it, I'm gone take it
If you're in it, you're coming with me
Bench warmers, get no playing time
No sleeping til I cross the line, I'm running

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
If I get knocked with my gun nigga I'm running
If I catch a murder one nigga I'm running
Homicide come around and they keep on coming
That's why I'm out of state and I keep on running
I ain't Nelly but my Desert Eagle's on girl
Just dropped bail traveling the world
When I sign my deal I said fuck jail
I went on tour to Barcelona and Brazil
This shit real fuck an appeal
D's want my head like that bitch in Kill Bill
Sling dope sling crack and them E pills
That's why I'm on the low like a damn navy seal, I'm running

[Hook: Dion]
Got to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
If you got it, I'm gone take it
If you're in it, you're coming with me
Bench warmers, get no playing time
No sleeping til I cross the line, I'm running

[Verse 3: The Game]
Cause I gotta pack them shows
And Dre told me ain't no coming back from gold
So I gotta get my album in place
My G-Unit features, my Eminem sixteens, my Dr. Dre beats
And it was two years from today when I started rhyming
And took my demo to Suge and he ain't sign me
Niggas threatening my life like it's hard to find me
See me shining in the hood like twenty inch Lexanis
My mom said I'm hard head, I don't follow the rules
Why should I when Reebok giving niggas they own shoes
And I'm dealing with the same problems 50 Cent got
Yayo in jail and they think I'm trying to take his spot
I'm in the studio laughing at Chris Rock
Then I turn on MTV and see Soulja Slim shot
And niggas trying to gun me down in the rim shop
Cause I just want the same recognition that the Crips got
They say I'm the next in line and if I get shot
Then I go out as the Bobby Fischer of hip hop
Make your chest move, Sylvia Rome and Kevin Lyle slept cool
Jimmy Iovine was the best move

[Hook: Dion]
Got to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
If you got it, I'm gone take it
If you're in it, you're coming with me
Bench warmers, get no playing time
No sleeping til I cross the line, I'm running
