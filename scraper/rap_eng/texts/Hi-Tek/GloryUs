[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Hey, howdy I am super duper Cud
You can find me drowning in some Henny mixed with groupie love
All of the above like I'm Maino or option D
When there's no more realness look to Cleveland and find me and Chip
Papi and my kin them, that's my kin them, that's my crew and friends
Whitmore's fucking niggas stomach up
Hot Sauce Willies still be killing when I'm drinking though
Used to ride my bike all day through bicycle jungle though
Post up, grind hard,watch cops, give them a smile
Not doing wrong, just chillin' low, yeah,we gotta find our way
If I focus on my grizzle not these bopped out hoes
Trynna find me a Halle Berry out in Bedford
Somebody I could Desperately Housewife, but be like
"Fuck you, nigga! I ain't trynna play housewife!"
Ohhh independent- I give her some good dick and
She understand whenever and other records about woman I'm amazing
Better known as crazy, you see now you don't have to like me
Please respect the fucking glory of the mighty

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
We the all all all
Almighty glory glory glory
Almighty glory glory glory
Almighty glory glory glory
GloryUs

[Verse 2: Chip Tha Ripper]
Yeah wassup, they call me Chip I just be chillin' doh (though)
L-E-X-U-S'n through these crazy hoods and bumpy roads
Memories and livin' conditions worse than you've ever seen
Now it's total opposite, I'm self made fresh and clean
Straight up menace, we some rebels better get it right
Most advice I get, I just can't use it they don't live this life
Hope for the best but it's probably bad as it seems
I brainstormed comin' up yeah I had a few dreams
Used to stand outside of Aldi's gettin' tips to help with bags
9 years old, runnin' shopping carts to get that quarter back
Shooting my bang bang, nigga don't drive too fast around my hood
Wish I could change they perspectives and tell em what's really good
Blow about four hundred a day on that purple cali tree
Cause life is overwhelming maintaining finance and sanity
Say what's on my mental and disregard the emotion though
Try to stay on track and keep at it till where I'm posed to go
Before my grandma passed she told me I would lead the people
I'm all that is man, fearless, have yet to meet my equal
I'm cold
Ladies and gentlemen, hood niggas and bitches
You all about to witness how nobody fucking wit us

[Hook]
