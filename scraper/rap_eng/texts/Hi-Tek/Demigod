[Verse 1: Memnon]
I was born a baby demigod
Placed at the foot of the Acropolis
Cryin, like where my momma is?
I had a journey in front of me that was preposterous
A child chosen from obscurity to represent duality
Doomed from the start
To be trapped in this reality
They wrapped my body in a gold fleece sweater
To protect my little limbs from the weather
The temperature was low
You could see the little particles of snow as they roam the air
These minor tests that would prepare me
To roam the land like a Roman
My destiny was to take over
In 21 years I would be plotting
On how to get me a condo on the Mare Nostrum
But see that system on top of me like a fucking coaster
I ain't black enough for the blacks
...and I ain't white enough for the whites
So in this racial purgatory I chillll
Smoking on that percolated vapor
Bong rip so smooth, that's perforated paper
Songs just so smooth they swear I need a label
They say sign his whole crew! No need we got a label
That's VS
...Yes I wrote this in the P.S.,
That I was sent to combat all things in society diabolical
That's hard-wired in my molecules
And its clear from the papers and periodicals
That oppression from day 1 has been methodological
Imma need uhhhhh
An abacus and a couple added blessings
So check it
I breathe in, think about strategies to address it
I breathe out, to collect my ideas took a second
Cuz I'm high as the motherfucking moon
Higher than Europa and Titan
Higher than Io and Phoebe
Please believe me
When I say that black is an endangered species
They put us on the list with the polar bear and the white rhino
This fight is final
Leaving pock marks up on your vinyl now
Ay we've been talking rebellion we need to try it now
Ay we've been talking rebellion we need to try it now

[Hook:Memnon]
Please believe me (what?)
When I say black is an endangered species (for real?)

[Verse 2: Memnon]
Now I got the sword in my hand like Aeneas
With instructions to build a new city
With a couple of soldiers ready to move with me
So I guess I'm cool with robbing the system
It's robbing me and my sister
My father and mother stressing
So give me a couple beats and I promise you I'll address it
Guess who owns most of Sallie Mae...John Boehner
Pulling strings for daughter while he up in admin
Playing the cool executive while he steady raping my homies
Making a smooth exit every time it's brought up
Come on now, dog, that's not how we was brought up
To believe some bullshit like this?
They taking our fucking money and then they use it on they kids
How much simpler can it get
This is caveman shit
But you know what? I'm not gon' stress
Ay dog you know what? I'm not gon stress
Imma cake up
And make sure my niggas are ready to fucking stake out
Not to mention all the motherfuckers that couldn't go to college, (why?)
Cuz society already weeded them out
Just from some weed charge or cuz they quick at the mouth
They could have been building a bridge
Or working on a jet
Instead they under the bridge crosstown, and they off the jet
Meanwhile, Senators, yup, they stepping off them jets
Wondering which minority to target next

I gotta take a small respiration
So turn it up until the speakers can't take it

[Verse 3: Memnon]

But now I'm back like the tails of a coin
I'm reading your fucking raps and it's like Tales of the Boring
You call that shit rapping
I call my shit respect to Yassin, Talib, and Common
I doubt me and you have too much in common
Other than the words that we pair up with words
But on the real I've got poems from an alternate world
I pulled them out from the forest when I would stay the night
Getting my jays rolled by some pixies and sprites
They stepping on your cd's like you the Dixie Chicks
I'm looking at your team
Like how'd you pick these chicks
I hate leaving
I'll leave this beat steaming
The baby monitor's on, nigga I hear the streets screaming...
I hear the, I hear the
I hear the streets screaming....
