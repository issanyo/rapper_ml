[INTRO]
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who is it?


[HOOK: MATRIX]
I’m a product of my block
When you see me gotta pay
Call up all the boys
Cult palace were I stay
Had to block the haters
Get the fuck up out my face
When you see me better run
Bitch we do this everyday

[VERSE: MATRIX]
Say that we got beef but I never heard your name
Say you run the town but your momma's where you stay
Hi-Tek on the beat, man the boy is too insane
I should’ve cop that jacket from Alexander Wang

Yea
Alexander Wang

[VERSE 2: MATRIX]
Okay okay I’m reloaded
Diamonds color coded
I just roll it, she can smoke it
Damn you novice
Boy you garbage
Looks like all your views done came up out your wallet

[SKIT]
"So you tellin' me for 300 dollars, you put your song on the radio and 10,000 views?!"

[VERSE 3: MATRIX]
Stone cold tee bitch came from 98
Vintage tees, cost me
Way more than what you say
Got beef but dawg the cheese is what I crave
Shawty let me slide up and down, told her charge me

I ain’t gonna lie they don’t like me X2

Bunch of fakes and they snakes homie we ain’t Gucci
Gold teeth while I’m sippin' on Moscato D Asti
Got a bad little bitch and she came from Germany
Rubbing on my Carhartt and told me who gon' stop me

[BREAK]
We don’t play no games boy!
Talking all that shit a get you stained, boy!

[VERSE 4: MATRIX]
Do it for the city cuz the city riding with me
Riding private in a caddy mr sub i get a philly
Got a chick that say she use to hang with Louie
And Lil Durk
Now she riding with the Cult got a Glock up in her purse

[HOOK: MATRIX]
I’m a product of my block
When you see me gotta pay
Call up all the boys
Cult palace were I stay
Had to block the haters
Get the fuck up out my face
When you see me better run
Bitch we do this everyday
