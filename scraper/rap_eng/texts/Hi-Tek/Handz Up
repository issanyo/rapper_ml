[Verse 1:] [Hi-Tek]
It's too much money to get, too many avenues
Too many punch in the clock for a nigga to snooze
Too much hip hop in for a nigga to be crying the blues
A jazzy nigga straight from the natty zoo
Diamond laid the track so I jumped on the train
I'm Hi-Tek, what the hell is Mark twain saying
I'm ahead of my time, niggas like dime
Show me the rope for what need to be climbed
Gotta shine cuz they barely hear my vocals
From the midwest, so my music sound bi- coastal
I use to catch the greyhound to NY
With that mp6o and a pound of [?]
Grind more, legend of the story the time told
If i had to do it again I do it ten fold
My love for the music way beyond a couple, a couple models and bottles of [?]

[Chorus:]
Ain't nobody stopping us here
On my own, We the man
Put yo hands up [x4]
Ain't nobody stopping us here
Stop playing these childish games
Put yo hands up [x4]

[Verse 2:] [Diamond D]
You damn right, I'm somebody
The coach of this, you know, Vince Lombardi
I run drills, call all the shots
All you do is pop pills, fuck all the thots
When this shit pops off call all the cops
Niggas wanna walk the line, Johnny Cash
Talking money but looking like 'I need cash'
And I'm high, Stevie Ray Vaughan
On locked, but the MPC stays on
Or the MPV plays on
??? the MPC stays on.. nigga
Lick a ball now and suck a dick later
Dope niggas out in the O, Dick Slater
Eating yo food with just a quick cater
Celebrating now, take the flick later
[?] niggas, no click [?]

[Chorus]
