(feat. Push Montana)

[VERSE:]
Big tough ass nigga just came home
Ain't been a month and he about to get his brains blown
Brolic black motherfucker think his name quan
Heard he mad that a nigga touched his baby moms
He heard she fuckin with a nigga named push
A young fly cocky rappin nigga from the brook
He said he don't kno a lesson he gon learn him
He gon catch him slippin and this pistol gon burn him
He don't kno wat that statement just earned him
A first class ticket to the morgue my lord
Some niggas don't believe they need proof
He runnin round like bishop so he feel he got the juice
Shit but he ain't a rental james simpson
No killer the glove ain't fittin
Homie we ain't the same we weigh different
I ain't beefin with u I ain't riffin
I'm a be outside of his crib listenin
For him to come out and let the gauge lift him

[Chorus:]
I put it in everybody know
He was in the pen he shoulda got a note
I don't care where you been or what you did before
If I say you gotta go then you gotta go
I put it in everybody know
He was in the pen he shoulda got a note
I don't care where you been or what you did before
If I say you gotta go then you gotta go

[VERSE:]
Verse 2 is about this young loud type nigga
You kno one of them always yelling always hype niggas
When he with his team only time he fight niggas
Get a couple bottles now he wanna ice niggas
I kno exactly wat you mean I ain't feelin em
Tell my homies chill nah man we ain't grillin em
Them type of dudes holmes I kno how to deal with em
Have my girl hit em with the dildo they feminine
Then put a couple slugs in the back of domes
I'm sorry lord but I'm bout to send this faggot home
I heard shorty kinda wild but I'm violenter
I'm a introduce this loud nigga to the silencer
Hit em up as soon as the light switch
Murder you and all your dogs call me mike vick
But I'm a different type of nigga I don't fight pits
I'll shoot bulldogs and end your life dick

[Chorus:]
I put it in everybody know
He was in the pen he shoulda got a note
I don't care where you been or what you did before
If I say you gotta go then you gotta go
I put it in everybody know
He was in the pen he shoulda got a note
I don't care where you been or what you did before
If I say you gotta go then you gotta go
