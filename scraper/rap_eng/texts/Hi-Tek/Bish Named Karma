Over Karma by Hi-Tek

First line fly fish in

WithOut a pail to pissin'

Still leaving whack rappers milk-carton missin'

Hit J's like Scottie Pippin as I taper off the medicine

Kids zombified 4-year-olds on Ritalin

Toss ya prescription

Become identifiable

Bust a nut on ya set, celebs unrecognizable

Dronin auditory like the dong of the dial-tone

TV and the radio where you get ur music bro?

Empty-V got you fiending for that pussy yo?

Let loose in the booth the inner beast that haunts me

Theater of the mind and the script is burning

Bludgeoned the head and my soul stay yearning

For a mate but my tunes too looney Bugsin out

Bugsby Siegel but the chip count down now

Van Gone wild and Tyson bit my ear off

Old friends leave I'm an alien to peers naw

Shot rye in the dark till tinnitus took over

Concert junkie and a festival roller

Drop my pills as da mood ride the coastah

Kick only with my Day One's we Jorduhns of Chicago

Willy Wonka flow emaciate the bars oh

Gospel blues to jazz we integrate innta hip-hop

Trippy churrin and our numbers climbing like Kids-Bop

Tapes Spider web and the net superVirals

Tryna catch the days when God toss me spirals

Soundboy record the savagery of the primal

Time to digress from the path beaten up

N. Korea got no lights, Kenyans fuck fags up

Rag real dirty scrub a doll wrapped in Louie

Distraction for the gaze why women love they Jewelery?

How long do we stand for Uncle Tom Foolery

Locking up convicts when these cops are all criminals

Dramas composed that are worse that Sprite's subliminals

Avarice of the sinner step working on my liver

Gotta hit the meeting, I'm out, see ya later
