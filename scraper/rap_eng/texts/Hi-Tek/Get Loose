[Interlude One: Talib Kweli]
We came here tonight to get loose
So before we leave we got to lift you
Higher than you ever been before, forget roof
Cause the world on fire, the girl on fire
Get loose, get loose, get loose, c'mon {*4X*}

[Hook: Chester French]
When you're on the cross you against the wall
A-waitin for more
Won't give a single dance
I seen it all before
But one day you'll find you should lose your mind
You can wait in self-control
Intoxicate yourself
Now get out on the floor
Get loose

[Talib Kweli]
So ma let you get a peek like a booth for 40 deuce
Knew the D make her freeze, she lookin for an excuse
To get loose, match the purse with the shoes, c'mon
You spit game, think she leavin wit'chu, yeah right
They sip Goose with the juice, spit the truth, c'mon
And get loose, get loose, get loose, c'mon
Now you might have a shot in the dark, if you play your cards right
If not it's a long hard night
Now, what can you say to get her to leave wit'chu?
Got her in your sight, you a heat-seekin missile
Spot her in the light, you wish you could be alone
Music in the back act like your theme song
You hate how it all sound like a ringtone
But when it come on in the club you sing along
She got one or two friends, bring 'em along
Un-less they wanted to {*edit*}, leave 'em alone

[Hook]

[Interlude Two: Talib Kweli]
Get loose, get loose, get loose, c'mon (get loose)
Get loose, get loose, get loose, c'mon
Get loose, get loose, get loose, c'mon (get loose)
Get loose, get loose, get loose, c'mon

[Interlude Two]

[Talib Kweli]
Aiyyo call the fire department cause the blaze has started
You ain't hot cause you flame retardant
I'm 'bout to hang up like a famous artist, in the Kweli museum
E'rybody feel him, can't nobody see him
Can't nobody be him, try as they might
But now it's dead, I defy afterlife
I spit in the face of the reaper as I address my wounds
Frontin for the chicks like Judy Blume
The dudes soon follow, they all sound recycled like bottles, cans
That's why I see through 'em like Hollow Man
They softer than model hands, no competition
Cause they flow not sufficient, they get thrown out the kitchen
Cause they can't take the heat, my throat is a flamethrower
Kweli and Tone ain't playin, it's game over
You could write it up, in the history books (look it up)
Or how they light it up, set it on fire, what? Fire it up!

[Interlude Two]

[Talib Kweli]
Oh word, once again like
Let's get a peek like a booth for 40 deuce
Knew the D make her freeze, she lookin for an excuse
To get loose, match the purse with the shoes, c'mon
You spit game, think she leavin wit'chu, yeah right
They sip Goose with the juice, spit the truth, c'mon
And get loose, get loose, get loose, c'mon
Now you might have a shot in the dark, if you play your cards right
If not it's a long hard night
Now, what can you say to get her to leave wit'chu? (let's go!)
Got her in your sight, you a heat-seekin missile (let's go!)
Spot her in the light, you wish you could be alone
Music in the back act like your theme song
You hate how it all sound like a ringtone
But when it come on in the club you sing along
She got one or two friends, bring 'em along
Un-less they wanted to mess, leave 'em alone

[Hook]

[Talib Kweli]
Oh that's how we do
This is how we do it in the 'Natti
Ay, Brooklyn stand up!

The definition of revolution, revolution is
Reality, Equality, Victory, Ovaries, Lexus, Ãœber, Twitter, Internet, Outerspace, Neverland
All the revolution is

I could do this shit all day for you motherfuckers
