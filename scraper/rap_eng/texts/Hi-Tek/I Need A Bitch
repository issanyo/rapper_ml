I need me a bitch, with some big old thighs
I need me a fine ass mothafuckin' bitch with some pretty ass eyes

[Rob Stricklong]
I gotta fuck wit cheeks, got a house up on the beach
Everyweek she call me just to beat up the peach
'Til she reach a climax, scratches on my back
Hit it from the back, baby told me she like that
Infact, you the first one to make it feel right
I knew she wasn't lyin', knew the cat was real tight
And afta tonight, you gone remember me
Armed Robbery, put my love up there where your liver be (Haha)
I told her never speak on me (Damn)
'Less ya want your burnt out friends ta creep wit' me, go ta sleep wit me
I hit her frequently, take them women off the chain
Can duck game, eva see the bitches run the train (Uh-uh)
It ain't the same (Uh-uh), afta I knock it out the frame
You wonder why just now ya start gettin' brain
I knock 'em out, pull chickens wit'out a doubt, fo' clout
Ask Nate Dizzal what I'm all about
