[Hook]
It's on you if you wanna hate (we stay true)
You can ice skate (you and you)
But you don't hold no weight (listen)
This is how we do around here
(Repeat x2)

[Sean Price]
I know you don't like me, I don't like you
You wanna fight me, well fuck it, let's fight, duke
I'm one fifth of the Fab, I'm one eigth of the great
I got shit on the ave, I've made cake out of state
Smack clown niggas, back down niggas
In the front yapping or the background niggas
B-U-C-K is that town, nigga
R-U-C-K the fact's found, nigga
So listen as the God Body rap
I pop this and twist it when the god shottie clap
Yo, recognize the name
Sean Price, recognize my game, you 'stand me now

[Buckshot]
Critics, rip 'em down like thunder pound
Making niggas wonder how that nigga Buckshot still around
Knowing you pop the most shit
While y'all pop that Cris' and that Moe shit I get scoliosis
Cause I ain't straight til I see every one of my niggas rise
Don't say shit to Buck, I solidify, come on guy
Recognize and correct, anybody disrespect
I'mma show you parts of your body you never met
Let's start with your heart, then next let's visit your bark
I'm good with the arts, kicking my part
Like done deal, signed and sealed
The contract on your life is a mill, what the deal?

[Hook]

[Top Dog]
A brother shoulda seen the position
When I fuck your woman inna last night
You shouldn't g'wan fi badda fuss
You shouldn't g'wan fi badda fight
I don't know baby, maybe it's the dog in me
That got me running around, marking my territory
Don't try to stop me now cause I'm ahead of the pack
Chasing that cat, girl, you know I know better than that
You say you love me when you know you hate me
See me on the screen and try to date me
But I play the streets cause that's where the cake be
Because I'm D-O-G you wanna leave me lonely, lonely, loney

[Steele]
Screw me? Screw you
Who me? Who you?
I do me, you do you, respect the General
I'm too true to the game, you new in the game
Mad cause I get up in the clubs with my Timbs and jeans
Weed in my seams, pass all the fiends
We all VIPs, beat my ass, in your dreams
So my company better have my currency
Been acting funny currently, I might react violently
Don't like the fact that programmers can't stand us
We too military, record labels can't handle us
Press click cameras, we click-click-click hammers, bruh
Get slick, we sic the animals
Far from amateurs, we professionals
Hard bars and bricks lock shit like correctional
This industry two-way like bisexual
BC straight in your face, defrost niggas next to you

[Hook]

[Buckshot]
You can ice skate, meaning bounce and breeze
Bounce so leave, you could have a ounce of trees
Fuck fatigue, we white tees, cut the sleeves
You gotta love it how we thugging with ease
Oh of course Buck the boss, toss molotovs in your Ford Explore
You niggas ain't raw, you poor, this is what you can't afford
To keep dissing Buck thinking I'm soft
Baby, I put it down when you was in drawers
I ain't never say pause
Fuck a fad, fuck the latest trend
I leave bodies where I lay this pen
And next time I gotta say this again
I'mma say... exactly
Not a lot but the gun'll spray, now run and play

[Sean Price]
It's on you baby for everything
Grab guns, take rings, chain bling, everything
No doubt Ruck is the best, my kids think I'm such a success
They don't know a motherfucker's a mess
I used to stand on the block with Rock for fun
With a pocket full of rocks and ones
Stopped that, now I got chips from illegal stock tips
When I draw heat on crackers on Wall Street
