[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Ya niggas got me high
Niggas got me high

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Hey! Well that's exactly what a nigga came for
Huh, you talking shots from afar
I'ma meet you at your front door
Uh, so hard to be doing what you really meant for, beauty
Huh, but don't I make it look easy
Don't I make it look good

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You drank up all my liquor, come on
What I'm supposed to do now?
And you talking all that shit, now come on
You gonna have to back it up
If I get too high now, sugar, come on
I might never come down
You know I might never come down
Let me get down
You might not never come down
Now let me come down
You might not never come down
Let me get down!

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Can't beat it, can't beat it
Can't beat it, can't beat it with the big bad door
Can't see her with this pitch black Gucci frames on
Let me take these bitches off
Let me get the full scope, hold up
Huh, full screen, HD, let me take another picture
Let me pull it to the pre-show
Whoa, cool beans, cool beans
That's a whole lot of reefer
Let me help you with the pre-roll

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You, drank up all my liquor, come on
What I'm supposed to do now?
And you talking all that shit, now come on
You gonna have to back it up
If I get too high now, sugar, come on
I might never come down
You know I might never come down
Let me get down
You might not never come down
Now let me come down
You might not never come down
Let me get down!

[Bridge: Anderson. Paak]
You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile
You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Okay now take that, Maybach, where the Wraith at?
The Bentley truck if you can pay that
A small village, you could say that
But you'd rather take your bankroll to Rodeo
Let her raid that? No, tell 'em "hell no"
Middle finger, duck, roll and tell pros
Stick it to the rear like it's velcro
What other country can you sell blow?
And for less than a kilo, man, you get an elbow
I'm gettin' high, never come down
Round up your rile and we'll run it down
Soon as it dries I'ma run the town
I fantasize shooting Trump down
A shot for every black man who got gunned down
By the police with no convictions, still they run 'round
When we protest they tell us pipe down
For Trayvon and Mike Brown
CNN wanna make it black/white
Cause we hit the action with a blacklight
Make them suckers act right, yeah!

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You, drank up all my liquor, come on
What I'm supposed to do now?
And you talking all that shit, now come on
You gonna have to back it up
If I get too high now, sugar, come on
I might never come down
You know I might never come down
Let me get down
You might not never come down
Now let me come down
You might not never come down
Let me get down!

[Bridge: Anderson. Paak]
You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile
You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile
