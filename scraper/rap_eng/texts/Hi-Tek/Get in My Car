[Verse 1]
I'm a straight guerilla with it, cold hearted killa with it
Any nigga gettin' outta line can get it
I make it hot, mothafuckas freeze up when I come through
Mac-10, 32 shot clip in my snorkel
I might smile and say what's up but I don't fuck with you niggas
My rap money slow up, I'll run up on you niggas
I'm on the edge, I'm just waitin' on a nigga to push me
Put my hand on my strap, what you lookin' at pussy
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends
So much chrome on my Benz, you see your face in my rims
If your bitch wanna roll, I'mma let her get in
I don't play but I'm a playa 'til the mothafuckin' end

[Hook]
I got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind
I tell the hoes all the time, bitch, get in my car (Bitch, get in)
I got my 64, ridin' on Dayton spokes
And when I open that do', bitch, get in my car

[Verse 2]
Don't tell me you don't know that, uhh, I'm the shit
Now you better watch ya girl mane, I leave with ya bitch
I ain't stuntin' these hoes, man I'm bout my paper
If your bitch really 'bout it, nigga I'm gon' take her
Backseat of my jeep, fuck 'til I fuck up her make up
Take her to the Diamond District, introduce her to Jacob
Tell her if she like me, she should keep me icey
My game fuck with a bitch brain 'til she think she wifey
Spent her life savings in a day, cause she likes me
Committment from me, uhh, nah not likely
Went out Vivica, I thought I was onto somethin'
But then the next week, nah, man it was nothin'

[Hook]
I got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind
I tell the hoes all the time, bitch, get in my car (Bitch, get in)
I got my 64, ridin' on Dayton spokes
And when I open that do', bitch, get in my car
I got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind
I tell the hoes all the time, bitch, get in my car (Bitch, get in)
I got my 64, ridin' on Dayton spokes
And when I open that do', bitch, get in my car

[Verse 3]
Look into the windows of my soul, the eyes never lie
They blood shot red, it's ganja in my system, I'm high
First it's pain when you lust for love, then it's smooth and calm
Feel the rush, like a needles in your arm
It's a cold world baby girl, lovin' me is not enough
Find out when you fuckin' broke, love won't get you on the bus
Man you should see the pretty bitches that be sexin' me
They suck cock that make 'em hot, I just let 'em stand next to me
Hundred percent thug, freak too, I'll taste your love
69's the position, your mouths full baby, huh?
My conversation's so deep, I get in your head
Next thing you know, you yawnin', turnin' over and I'm in the bed

[Hook]

[Outro]
Hahaha
Quit playin' bitch get in
You know you wanna ride with a nigga
50 Cent
G-G-G-G-G-Unit
Hahaha
