Fuck y'all
He used to be a hustler, he ain't real no mo'

Loose lips sink ships, tattle-tellin gets you killed fast
I hope you get knocked off wit your snitchin ass
Made a deal cause the jail had you scared
Can't do your time so you sold to the Feds
Nigga kill yourself, you a dead man walkin
L.T. got life, and homie still ain't talkin
So all of them niggas puttin wires on
Don't say nuttin when your family get fired on
They say your man took the stand and he didn't think twice
They took his life, and they didn't think twice
It's an eye for an eye, you rat you die
Ain't nobody 'posed to know when the pack arrive
See the judge is the pimp cause he made you snitch
Light you up and he didn't pay you shit, who the bitch?
Ha ha

Trip, me and Cuz used to dress alike, wear the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, my nigga for life, so the gang goes
Nigga used to bang with me, smoke dope with me
Sold coke with me, went low with me, we gon' fold fifty
Oh so shifty, bitchy bitchy switch the game up
Put me in the frame up, nigga came up
Sellin 'caine for us, tryin to make a name for us
Sticky, it's tricky and quite dangerous, cuff and chain him up
Make him talk I bet he squeal, real shit I'm dishin out
Why you niggas be bitchin now? I ain't make it up
I ain't break it up, Cuz you keep me on some bullshit
I ain't with that bullshit, my nigga I'm on this real shit
Stack a bill shit, crack a meal ticket
Every time I spills nig', yeah I'm on this real shit
Now, don't you, come to the house Cuz, on the dub
Cuz I put my gun in your mouth, now nigga bounce (bounce bounce)

[Trick Daddy]
Hmm, the life I'm livin, and how I do my thug thizzle
Separates me from all of them fuck niggas
See I don't deal with niggas who ain't real
He in character, playin some life that ain't his
He testify, wasn't wise and make deals
So stop talkin on the phone boy, the streets got ears
Here's some niggas doin 20 to 30 years
That'll lie on yo' ass, and knock five off his
Affiliation with niggas that's living ruggedly
Will get a nigga like me, charged with conspiracy
Before you know it you been followed by the knuckleheads
And yo' job is to make his ass do his
Bein in the wrong place, can really hurt your case
And ain't no sense to talkin in codes, they already know
Them niggas who you used to hustle with before
Kinda wanna play the role so they already told, you know
