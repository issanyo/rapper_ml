Yo
It's the London state of mind
Read the lines g
Across the river Thames
From that London side
Three
Thoughts
With a city
That is crafted by the pen
For twenty years
I been
Trying to repent
Trying to stay content
Never to hold a weapon
To
Kill a Nigga
With a trigger
Isnt make me big
But threatened
Check myself in
Mirror
Cold
Like
Bishop in juice
Stack  loot to look cool
What's the state of every day
Have a couple kids
Be married
Have an limited salary
, live in some outskirts
In  south east london
Proudly
Or chase my dreams
To be a heavyweight  Emcee
I ain't talking
Uk Emcee
But 2Pac, Pun
Or B.I.G
I know the accent ain't shit
Nigga
Let's face it
Slick
Rick
Made it cool with patience
One of the godfathers
Stories to tell the children
One eye
And  saw appeal in
Free country
Comfy with their scene
And
Theme
And ain't keen
On another scene
Taking their cream
I rehearsed
The words
To paint a picture of the dream
Now
Money's on my mind tho
One road
I see it's narrow
Failure flashbacks
Keeps me paro
My aims
Sacred
With Gods arrow
And To be
Frank like the ocean
I'm trying to reach highs in life
Without tree smoking
Or should I  let it go
Like frozen
Hate the others in big positions
Putting doubts
In
My new decisions
Trapped in
This mental prison
Of watching
Them nex man prosper
When I need time to foster
Gotta stand out
Is Why I act proud fam

(Chorus Yo it's
London State of Mind 3) (2X)
I Rehearse the words to paint a picture of the grind  (3X)
