"You said you had some friends"

[Verse One]:
Grandmama always used to say
"Teeth and tongue fall out." So I ain't trip if we ain't hang out
Then we flipped and wouldn't hang out
Word from mutual friends when you speak it's fuck me comin' out cha mouth
Fuck me? Nigga, fuck you
But damn I was the man whenever bills was overdue
Shit
Got my deal, I ain't even tripped once
I was the new MC Hammer take ya niggas to lunch
Help homies, give 'em money when they caught in the crush
But what's funny, run out of money and you ain't called me once
Now my childhood friends turned to childish ass men
Mad cause I ain't broke and fucked up like them
With thirty five kids and a dead end job
Trying to throw a guilt trip like the shit my prob
Nah
Now they mad they wanna hate on my shine
Who needs enemies when I got friends like mine

[Chorus]:
Had yo back but you didn't have mine
Act like you didn't now me half the time
Can't believe this
Now I see it's bad intention
It's not worth it

Smile in my face then stab me in the back
True homeboys don't get down like that

But you see seasons changes
Love changes
Best friends become strangers

[Verse Two]:
Ain't you happy for me that I made it in rap
You rather see me join the army and get killed in Iraq
Damn
You'll be glad if I died
Cause it kills you when I pass by in that fancy ass ride
With a fine ass chick in the passenger side
You in some dusty ass Honda it's your fat bitch's ride
I remember my 85 Maxima
You niggas filled it up but rarely ever put gas in 'er
Early morning saw you niggas was weak
I did all the hard work putting down in the street
Made all the contacts through your time into beats
You'd just come write a verse and kick up yo feet
And got the nerve to run around to say you made me
And I used you, nigga you crazy
Now my former homies hatin' saying, "Bishop is wack."
But Bishop is signed, wheres your contract?

[Chorus]:
Had yo back but you didn't have mine
Act like you didn't now me half the time
Can't believe this
Now I see it's bad intention
It's not worth it

Smile in my face then stab me in the back
True homeboys don't get down like that

But you see seasons changes
Love changes
Best friends become strangers

[Verse Three]:
You know what's funny to me, but it's sad though
This rap shit can turn yo friends into some assholes
And bitch niggas, yeah they might be rocking panty hoes
You better check them, they can hide them under normal clothes
And out west a lot of rappers say they so hood
Yeah right more like west Hollywood
And it's a small world I know most of these dudes
A few I consider friends but most I consider fools
Fools that think I'm food with the lies they try to
Disguise and decide to use, but I am not amused
Gypsy ass rappers steady dick hopping crews
Wondering around connivin' on whoever they can use
Miss Carly Simon, prolly think this songs about you
But it's too many to name so just fuck all you
Hit begin with pain I end it with laughter
Now I see why 'Pac made I Ain't Mad At Cha

[Chorus]:
Had yo back but you didn't have mine
Act like you didn't now me half the time
Can't believe this
Now I see it's bad intention
It's not worth it

Smile in my face then stab me in the back
True homeboys don't get down like that

But you see seasons changes
Love changes
Best friends become strangers
