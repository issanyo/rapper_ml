[Verse 1: Var]
Sitting down writing in the room
Niggas stay biting so I use a little lighting
And you making noise guess I'm lightning before the boom
But even the thunder lost too
So I spit heat, history
In the making give or take a few
Syndicated views
Nigga I don't do, that
But I'm in to breaking rules
Tryna get schooled? get ya backpack
Then it's on in a few
But I ain't tryna lose
Nigga got the blues but
The booze just removes all the bruises
Ya snooze then ya losin
Cruise with my crew in this crew neck
They askin who next?
Well you guess
I'm the best out, y'all just too tech
Better yet all these niggas flagrant
Nothing personal but you just ain't shit
I be so high like a spaceship
But all I need now is a little respiration

[Hook: Var]
Inhale exhale
Cuz your mind is a ticking time bomb, we don't need no detonation
You niggas hurting the game
You want a whip and a chain
While I'm worried about reparations
All I need is respiration
All I need is a little respiration
Inhale, Exhale cuz your mind is a ticking time bomb

[Verse 2: Var]
Throw on the cargo fatigues, you can't see me
Even if Var go down leagues you can't sea me
Baked like a ziti
Stay in the lab like DeeDee
The way SSE be
Try copyin it ain't easy
Believe me, many have tried
To send me outside to beat me
The cyphers come alive when I arrive but die when I'm inside
Cuz niggas don't wanna spit when I give em shit that rhyme, that columbine
I'll school ya, Then blast holes at assholes
That try to act like they mack hoes and rap flows that's hard
But Var don't let it slide
You better hide cuz karma stay outta sight and ruin your mind
Two at a time
It got you thinking and debating
What's at the next turn?
Relax, you need some respiration
Inhale exhale cuz your mind..

[Verse 3: Var]
The next in line for this petty crime
I steal the show and your attention
Not to mention that every line
I said is mine
This beat is flat line, killed it
But I ain't hear no gats firing
And I can swear these cats lying
Like lazy kittens, say he spitting but it's backfiring
These daffy ducks shooting they self in the face
When they race and try to keep up wit the pace
But they can't handle the taste, when they biting
They say it's like all types of spices
Mics is lifeless when I approach em
These niggas popping up talking about bread so I had to toast em
You bad and so slim
Too bad you ho'in seem like every bitch around flick ash and carry lotion
I guess they into handies while they toking
They legs be wide open
They like it fast so impatient
But I tell em slow down girl cuz you need some respiration

[Hook: Var]
Inhale exhale
Cuz your mind is a ticking time bomb, we don't need no detonation
You niggas hurting the game
You want a whip and a chain
While I'm worried about..

[Verse 4: Jedi]
Inhale, and let it all sink in
Make em panic I'm so titanic when I'm inking
Ironically a nigga bout his iceberg, lettuce
The money turns me on, it's like I got a fetish
It's one of those things that you don't get if you don't got it, get it?
They sleeping cuz they're hollow and headless
Hoarse voice from just spitting it so stupendous
Infinity and beyond, I'm Buzz Light year to the limits
I'm right here, where the critics?
A breath of fresh air in my nike airs, I'm sprinting
Catch me if you can, I'm like lightning when I'm in it
Ain't writing with my right hand, I'm left-handed
I'm different they can't stand
I'm gifted with no santa
They hard as nails until they get hit with the whole hammer
Giving your soul cancer
It might make it hard to breathe
I'm giving you all answers they call me the cheat sheet

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Trife]
All I need is respiration
But really ain't no time left for hating
This movie ends with murder, that's your final destination
Been at the finish line before I knew that we was racing
Homie I put in work and rapping is my occupation
I been nice since I noticed I had a wind pipe
So blessed I question if I be committing sins right
I want the bread but don't give me a thin slice
Putting Jersey on out in New York without the pin stripes
My nigga, I deliver superb hits
A fresh prince without Will's last name, a wordsmith
Ask bitches, "Tell me what makes you think you deserve this?"
This music feeding my seed, you dropping that bird shit
I got, so much on my mind that I can't recline
I'm even better than y'all without the fancy rhymes
We break families up once me and my fam combine
I'm at the top pussies couldn't get a chance to climb
Gotta forewarn ya
Before you try to swarm on us
I'll run through your circle and square up with y'all on four corners
Damn, compared to me, y'all looking in bad shape
They couldn't fuck with the flow since I put out my last tape
Labels got you bending over, you getting your ass raped
You my son and child support is a bitch for my dad's sake
Ayo, this nigga Trife I ain't planning to stop
Fighting time like I'm boxing with the hands on the clock
For respiration..

[Hook]
