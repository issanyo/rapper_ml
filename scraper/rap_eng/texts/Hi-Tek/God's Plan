[Verse 1: Outlawz]
September 13th 1996, On the Vegas strip he laid to rest
Ever since I had a hole in my chest
And it happened the one day you ain't rock your vest
Only 25 you ain't even reach your full potential
Going through your struggle with the whole world watching you
Sat by you in the hospital for 6 days straight
I'm thinking damn how much can one man take
My thug angel I won't stray you
You saved us and raised us
Homie this corner's like cages
Graced the world with your presence Ima rep it till the death of me
O-U-T-L-A-W-Z, the recipe
I'm the voice of the slum, the hope for the young
I'm the last outlaw man I know I'm the truth
I was trained by the best to carry on tradition
To carry the torch complete the mission, streets is listening
They keep axing is Pac alive
I tell em hell yea nigga you can see him in my eyes
All you gotta do is look it's a page out the book
We starting a new chapter
This a cash bill massacre
It's more than music
Homie its a movement
Only Makaveli know what we doing because he approved it
It's all God's plan you ain't go nothing to do with
Young Niggas understand me, they know just why I do this

[Verse 2: Outlawz]
Homie this ain't love
I was sent to you niggas from Pac
Him and Khadafi was hot
They thought ya'll was gon' stop
This is God's plan, I am God's best friend
I feel like I'm in the same car Pac got shot in
But it's bulletproof
Fuck Talking you can see the truth
If your past is a hypocrite what the hell he teaching you
Take the Farrakhan route and try to reach the youth
My people dying before we get a chance to reproduce
The government keep lying, god bless the fucking troops
While the bullets flying Bush sipping Grey Goose
My little cousin doing life he only 22
Telling me he aite for something he didn't do
We here for a reason, do you niggas understand?
Ja, theres no man who can stop God's plan

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
Real Niggas be saying, if your boy was living
Rappers now a days, they wouldn't be getting
I've been in the game real heavy since before '9-5
Knew BIG when his timbs used to lean to the side
I'm a outlaw nigga, blood sweat and the tears
Some of the realist from the row, yeah you heard me clear
Yea they owe us some change because we done paid our dues
I'm still hungry as hell, these rap niggas is food
Looking for cash money so we heading to Cashville
That nigga Buck real fuck how you niggas feel
Heater tucked still close to my flesh
Kadafi on my mind, nothing but murder left
