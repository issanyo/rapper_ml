[Verse 1: Main Flo]
I had to stay mental, when DEA stopped my gray rental
Incidental, my girl home watchin' Jay Leno
Prophesize, I pulled the wise
With frame eyes for disguise, talkin' like them white guys
Shallow demeanor, karma was the main schemer
What could be greener, when all I thought about was Beemers
Then came the questioning
Arresting me was steppin' rare
Asking permission so he could say he kept it fair
Fake mustaches and hundred yard dashes
Through lake molasses because my government's so fascist
Don't choose to ass-kiss dolo spots
Up near Damascus on all areas harassless
Don't wanna do enough confront a crew
That night I got two, went to sleep, woke up with guns drew
No time for cryin' cowards
Too late for fire power
Karma convinced me to meet him at his dyin' hour

[Chorus] (x2)
Now leading back to that night, reality strikes
Them unknown faces are the casualty types

[Verse 2: Donte]
When you watch yo' nigga rise and disguise
You despise 'cuz I built an enterprise
While you still livin' lies
And I'm all you wanna be, but that's all you gonna be
Get your long path and yo' ass from in front of me
Niggas thought you had my back and you was stealin' out my pack
When other niggas try to tell me "I wasn't even feelin' that"
That's my ace, that nigga got keys to my place
And he know about the cash, stashed G's in the safe
Wait, no time to waste when best friends player-hate
Relocate, (can't sleep), now I gotta stay awake
And take a still break, 'cuz I be dealin' with this ill fate
When niggas be fake, infiltrate and try to and steal weight

[Break] (x2)
"The way I vex, will cause an insane karma"

[Verse 3: Main Flo]
All up on the humble
Fuckin wit fake niggas that know I bubble
Precise juggle, 'cuz life is my type of struggle
Seven-fifty IL's, and tales of fly females
Who caught in these sales with live details
Shades by Cartier, and big links that hardly play
It could be Auste, let's do this in a large way
I wanna see the Amazon Basin
To set out to gather my thoughts into a calm basement

[Verse 4: Donte]
Man ain't nuttin' change, niggas don't know what they facin'
Already steady pacin', they seeds to be replacements
We ain't the felon type
Or into sellin' white
'Cuz everything money bring, children of the malonites
(I'm Bob's song) Provin' Ja live, not gone
To pay a devil on a loan, got to rob yo' own
No love with no peace, gave life to the beast
As the defecit increase, Exodus outta Greece
This note is legal tender, depths connect, render
Evil spender, people mentors resurrect to evil vendor now

[Chorus]
Now leading back to that night, reality strikes
Them unknown faces are the casualty types

[Break] (x4)
"The way I vex, will cause an insane karma"
