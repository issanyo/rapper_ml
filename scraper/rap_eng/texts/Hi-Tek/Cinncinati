[Hook]
Cincinnati
Home of jazz fest and blown spots
Bad cats and mingles, no culture no hip-hop
Black business stopped by cops who roam blocks
Niggas scared to pop, This shit's got to stop

[Verse 1: Main Flow]
The universal man, I caravan through lands of paper
Spectin' from the sands of Cali to the streets of New York State
From the home of bunk shit you thought it was dead
We brought it back like resurrection giving life to these heads
In the middle of the riddles many styles from my locals
Collecting data from the greater to create the bicoastal
Niggas fronting (mumbling) till the answer was handed
I manifest, not just be west, I represent the fucking planet
Holdin' on to my fire, keep my artist inspired
Illuminati based and rest in place for Roman Empire
Used desire, was to lock my soul for something minute
That's why I had to relocate but still come back and recruit
Some say it's not feasible I say people let's get down
Make our dreams come to life through these Hi-Tek sounds
We spread the land like disciples, smash and stifle the borders
New world wide music for a New World Order

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Donte]
I luminate provokes tax where action liver than a smoke stack
Bringing dope back, imagine that no longer broke cats
Up in the heart of it, material shit's hard to miss
Some kids'll play the Ricky Ross role for part of this
I'm deeply into faith, my gangs penetrate
'71 and '75 I play the interstates
Watching for road blocks, old cops, patrol stops
I know a couple heads and sneak them in through loading docks
I gotta get mine 1-800-hip-time
While others sip line, cash travels with quick dimes
My whole committees just hoping things end pretty
No souls and pity we operate from CinCity
They got me time and beast I keep my eyes on signs and leads
Combine and leaks and plus I heard hanus police
Came from the boot of us, its ludicrous he's using us
Cincinnati on the streets, you don't know who to trust

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Holmskillet]
Cincinnati, Sin city
Women pretty with no pity, bitches set you up through a mitte
Come and get he, your worst enemy your running with he
On the field of synergy look at how our end will we
Me myself made a pact, when I bombed in the stacks
Relax made it back, don't get caught in the act
Stand low on in the vigor, they don't know a nigga
Who ain't catching footballs running Deon figures
No neon glitter, which way switch hitter
I'm an eon splitter, little black bitch getter
I've been on my faith since them days decade
Won back to back state and the Rockwell skates
Now them looters feel great chatting Dre escaped
But Ohio's fenced in and we all inmates
Walking up Short Vine, Niggas catch court fines
Miss my court case date capeas fourth time

[Hook]
