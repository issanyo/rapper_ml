(Main-Flo _Verse one)
I had to stay focused, delayed moments in my beige Lotus
Someways hopeless, Tay was like yo Main float this
Play the bonus, lame brain that trained Ottis
He the boldest, days notice
I paged Lois, that babe knows us from getting crops and tours
Spots and blowers, exotic trees from the top growers
Cock the fours, I heard they just knocked the source
(so you say) Dont tell them that Glock was yours
Stock the drawers, with hollows so shots can pour
Block'll roar, at times we out fox'em more
Lots in store, mop the floors with 'copter wars
From here to over there, watch us unlock the doors

(Hook)
Face facts ill hooks always lace tracks
Make traps, dat collapse on a fake act
Great raps trace back to the safe crack
The ace jacked and the karma on a snake back

Face facts they infiltrate where you wake at
Count up your cake stacks
Watch where you take naps
Reptiles snacking on your packs and where you place maps
Hard to erase that dealing with these snake backs

(Donte_Verse one)
Devil in disguise invited in my enterprise
But God ain't into lies, and beasts get penalized
Wanna battle wanna bees, playin humble bumble bees
Simple test of the flesh, and you stumbled over G's
Went in where I'm livin' at nigga
Where I chill and max, it could've been a killin' black
You ain't even feelin' that
Looked him dead in his face
Crooked ace hit the safe
Took half of my stash and through the keys in the lake
But wait!
This nigga straight tried to say that I hate
Swore on kinship
And friendship that I violate
But when I violate you know your eyes dialate
High stakes for my papes and commercial fly weight

(Hook)

(Main-Flo_Verse two)
All up on an exit, fronting these snake backs
That got infected, rigtht where I sketched it
Big Ohio neglected, they got a check list
County on some left shit, where nigga's bless flip
Head for the jet strip, counting bread for a fresh trip
Mex click, stick with a crime outfit
That likes to set picks, reptiles up in the mix
Made connect sick, turn in your necklace
They watching where your nest sits

(Donte_Verse two)
No harmony, Karma be where enemies arming me
But be harming me normally
By robbin' my armoury
Informants informing me
Friend, foe, formally with info, warning me
Of your plans to corner me
How you snakes is on to me
In my face snakes charming me
Alarming me for papes all snakes lay dormantly
Take you space like Normandy, your life time warranty
Rest in peace and harmony, when you break in my pharmacy

(Hook x 2 )
