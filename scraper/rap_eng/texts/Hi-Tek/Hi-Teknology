"One thing I don't understand is HI-TEK!  Heheh
I can't wait to introduce you to him."

[Jonell - repeats in background]
Hi-Tek, no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no

[Hi-Tek]
Let 'em know
Gotta let 'em know now
Stop playin, Tekzilla (Tekzilla)
What?  Uhh
Ohh, ohh ohh ohh you an MC now?
Nah bruh, just gotta get a lil' somethin off my chest here
Youknahmtalkinabout?  (Fo' sho')
Yo, aiyyo

Peep game, man picture this, put it in a frame
Who woulda thought, young Tone doin thangs
Makin a change from the old hustle street slang
To beats that bang, I hustle my name
(Hi-Tek), gotta make it bang loud
M-P-C, three-triple-oh, with the eight outs
"Best Kept Secret" since Diamond D
Midwest rap puttin it down for Da 'Natti
You know I had to get on the mic, say somethin (what?)
People say I need to stick to the beats and cuttin (what?)
They front, these cats mostly haters
They hate to see me shine like the sun and rock my green gators
It's all love though (love though) just sayin how I felt
Get what I can get out the game, invest in somethin else
Fuck a Plan B, I got a Plan Z
Twenty-six ways to get paid, me and my man D
We young entrepeneurs, we get money
Don't mistake me for some backpack nigga that dress bummy
Yo, we put it down like it's heavy as hell
Straight from Da 'Natti, yo, yo, yo
