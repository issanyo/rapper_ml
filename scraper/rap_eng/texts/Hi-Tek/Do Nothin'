[Hook]
Do nothin', hit the snooze button
2x
Go back to sleep, put off reality
2x

Can't be bothered, Boxes of CDs in my room...
Can't be asked to shut em
Outside of theï»¿ gig with an unconfident pitch
Buy my album, Bizarre is on it
Psh I got no job, so what, I work for Don't Flop
Editing videos in my home, still at mums really i live alone
In a room that I don't leave
Don't need to!
I take more naps than old people...
You know a great way to kill time?
Sleep
Cruger, always inside: dreams
Nightly, daily, laaaaazzy
Oh this is Cruger's new shit? Sounds wack
I'm rapping 'bout myself now, how about that
I write rhymes that only I like
With a sense of humour no one finds funny...but me
I'm bummy, but leave me be
Only form of light I get is from my pc-screen
In my room where I just watch DVDs
And sleep to the menu screen leaps
My room just piles with needless stuff
I'm not a hoarder, I just can't be asked to clean it up
Don't put efford in anything
Empty bottles round the house like I'm collecting them
There are no wrong or right choices
My point is: Life's pointless

Life ain't important, it's boring
If the phone's ringing, ignore it
And [Hook]

I'm a motherfucking bum, i don't battle no more
My life's shit, I don't wanna rap about yours
Having to talk to a crowd...prefer if I don't
I'm awkward talking to one person alone
This verse is a joke, self-hatred
Diss my own tracks like somebody else made it
I'm a hater of the term 'hater'
It's like.. if someone doesn't like your tracks, they're a hater
But if you don't like my tracks, I don't hate ya
I agree with ya
I've been wack since I was an english tea sipper

(Laughs)

Yo , cause
Life ain't important, it's boring
If the phone's ringing, ignore it
And

Go back to sleep, put off reality
2x

Just sleep, cause when I dream
Life makes much more sense to me
Than I... wake up, realize that life is not what it's meant to be
But it...goes on, on and on and on and on and on and on
It.. don't stop, life's not short
It's long
It's long
It's long
It's looooooooooooooong
