[Intro]
Do something with your life, do something with your life
Do something with your life, do something with your life
Do something with your life (ooh), do something with your life
Do something with your life, do something with your life
With your life

[Verse 1: Tony Oller]
We broke down, trying to leave town
Flying down the road to change
We were born to run, Cali, here we come
Escape from Nowhere, USA

[Verse 2: Malcolm Kelley]
Say good-bye to white picket fences
Say hello to palm trees and Benzes
They say you got to fall to have it all
And we don't want two kids and a wife
I don't want a job, I just want a life
Sometimes the underdogs rise, and the mighty fall (And the mighty fall!)

[Hook: Tony Oller]
This ain’t the same summer song that you used to know
'Cause Jack left Diane thirty years ago
The world is spinning too fast for you and me
So, tell me, whatever happened to the American Dream?

[Verse 3: Tony Oller]
I know a girl, I met her last night
She was fresh off the plane
She whispered in my ear
"Baby, come here, I'll do anything to make a name."

[Verse 4: Malcolm Kelley]
Honey, take my hand, follow me, cause
I don't want to hurt you, but he does
I just want to give you some real advice
Never take candy from stranger
And keep your eyes open for danger
Because this right here is a twisted paradise

[Hook: Tony Oller]
This ain’t the same summer song that you used to know
'Cause Jack left Diane thirty years ago
The world is spinning too fast for you and me
So, tell me, whatever happened to the American Dream?

This ain’t the same summer song that you used to know
So, baby, let's live and die before we're getting old
You know that nothing is the way it used to be
So, tell me, whatever happened to the American Dream?

Na na na, na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na, na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na, na na na na, na na na na na

We were born to run, Cali, here we come
We're getting out of here, baby
Let's get out of here, ooh

[Hook: Tony Oller]
This ain’t the same summer song that you used to know
'Cause Jack left Diane thirty years ago
The world is spinning too fast for you and me
So, tell me, whatever happened to the American Dream?

This ain’t the same summer song that you used to know
So, baby, let's live and die before we're getting old
You know that nothing is the way it used to be
So, tell me, whatever happened to the American Dream?

Na na na, na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na, na na na na, na na na na na
