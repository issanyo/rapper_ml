[Verse 1]
I've always said I could never fall
Because I love 'em all
Mmm
My heart don't race when they try to call
Because I love 'em all

[Pre-Chorus]
But she got me stuttering
Like w-w-what can I do because I can't control it
She got me hovering
Above the ground and I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
God only knows
How much I need you
I could explode
If I can't breathe you
I'm on the ropes
5-4-3-2
'Cause you're the one
I guess I'm done
That's how it goes
Where will I be without you
Yeah, God only knows

[Verse 2]
There ain't a crime I wouldn't do for you
Let's make our getaway
Mmm
These diamonds shine, but not as bright as you
I'll throw them all away

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm here surrendering
And I give up, throwing my hands around you
Can't remember when
I fell like the way I fell for you

[Chorus]
God only knows
How much I need you
I could explode
If I can't breathe you
I'm on the ropes
5-4-3-2
'Cause you're the one
I guess I'm done
That's how it goes
Where will I be without you
Yeah, God only knows
God only knows
(Baby)

Yeah yeah yeah
Where will I be without you
Yeah, God only knows

[Bridge]
When you touch me
With your body
And all that I can think is how to lose our clothes
What's next
God only knows
God only knows
God only knows
Ooh

[Chorus]
God only knows
How much I need you
I could explode
If I can't breathe you
I'm on the ropes
Like 5-4-3-2
Cause you're the one
I guess I'm done
That's how it goes
Where will I be without you
Yeah, God only knows
Yeah, God only knows
Where will I be without you
Yeah, God only knows
