Yo, this one right here
Is for all the drop out-of-schoolers
The future cougars
The Mary Jane abusers
The ones that chose to be losers
For all the misfit kids and the total outcasts
MKTO, This one's for you
Role models

We are the ones
The ones you left behind
Don't tell us how
Tell us how to live our lives
Ten million strong
We're breaking all the rules
Thank you for nothing
Cause there's nothing left to lose

Thank you for feeding us years of lies
Thank you for the wars you left us to fight
Thank you for the world you ruined overnight
But we'll be fine
Yeah we'll be fine
Thank you for the world you broke
Like yolk and it ain't no joke
So cold and there ain't no coat
Just me my friends my folks and
We gonna do what we like
So raise that bird up high
And when they ask you why
Just stand there laugh and smile

We are the ones
The ones you left behind
Don't tell us how
Tell us how to live our lives
Ten million strong
We're breaking all the rules
Thank you for nothing
Cause there's nothing left to lose
Na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na na na

Thank you for the times you said don't make a sound
Thanks for the ropes you used to hold us down
Cause when I break through I'mma use them to reach the clouds
We ain't comin' down
We ain't comin' down
Look Ma I finally made it
This world is too damn jaded
My life is just like Vegas
Go big go home get faded
Been a prob since '92
Can't shut me down curfew
And them girls I'll take a few
Do what I wanna do

We are the ones
The ones you left behind
Don't tell us how
Tell us how to live our lives
Ten million strong
We're breaking all the rules
Thank you for nothing
Cause there's nothing left to lose
Na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na na na
Thank you from the bottom of my heart
From head to toe from the soul you ripped apart
I say thank you
I say thank you
Yeah thank you
Thank you, thank you Yeah, Yeah

We are the ones
The ones you left behind
Don't tell us how
Tell us how to live our lives
Ten million strong
We're breaking all the rules
Thank you for nothing
Cause there's nothing left to lose
We are the ones
The ones you left behind
Don't tell us how
Tell us how to live our lives
Ten million strong
We're breaking all the rules
Thank you for nothing
Cause there's nothing left to lose

Yo if you don't like what they tell you to do
Don't do it
If you don't want to be who they want you to be
Screw it
It's your world
It's your life
And they ruined it
