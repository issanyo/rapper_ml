[Intro]
Hey! Where's the drums?
Wooh oh oh oh
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Tony Oller]
Woo girl, you're shining
Like a 5th Avenue diamond
And they don't make you like they used to
You're never going out of style
Woo pretty baby
This world might have gone crazy
The way you saved me, who could blame me?
When I just wanna make you smile

[Pre-Hook]
I wanna thrill ya like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

[Hook 1]
You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
One of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic
Baby, you're so classic (Baby you)
Baby, you're so classic

[Verse 2: Tony Oller]
Four dozen of roses
Anything for you to notice
All the way to serenade you
Doing it Sinatra style
Imma pick you up in a Cadillac
Like a gentleman, bringing, glamour back
Keep it real to real in the way I feel
I could walk you down the aisle

[Pre-Hook]
I wanna thrill ya like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

[Hook 2]
You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
It's not a rewind, everything is so throwback-ish
I kinda like it like it
Out of my league, old school chic
Like a movie star from a silver screen
You're one of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic
Baby, you're so classic
Baby, you're so classic

[Verse 3: Malcolm Kelly]
Baby you're class, and baby you're sick
I never met a girl like you until we met
A star in the 40's, center fold in the 50's
You got met tripping out like the 60's, hippies
Queen of the discotheque
A 70's dream and an 80's best
Hepburn, Beyonce, Marilyn, Massey
Girl you're timeless
Just so classic

[Hook 2]
You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
It's not a rewind, everything is so throwback-ish
I kinda like it like it
Out of my league, old school chic
Like a movie star from a silver screen
You're one of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic
Baby, you're so classic
Baby, you're so classic
