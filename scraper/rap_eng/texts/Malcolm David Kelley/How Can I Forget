[Verse 1]
You wore that white sundress, smoked a clove cigarette
Danced barefoot and your hair was a mess
You drove a Jeep Cherokee but no money for gas
Coulda looked at you all day long, all day long
You tried to downplay your beauty but you couldn't fool me
You tried to play like you're tough but you grew up by the beach
Said you hated the world but somehow you liked me
Coulda looked at you all night long, all night long
Coulda looked at you all night long, all night long

[Chorus]
How can I forget you in the morning?
How can I forget you?
I was dreaming you were standing there wearing my t-shirt
Wishing that you could still be here
How can I forget? I can't, I can't
How can I forget? I can't, I can't

[Verse 2]
Ran ten blocks in the rain, girl
Train ain't running this late, girl
You the only one to do me like that
Why you biting on your lip like that? (Don't stop)
Falling through that doorway, stopping this ain't no way
(Okay, smoke break)
I shut my eyes for a second you were gone, gone, gone
Now I'm thinking 'bout you all night long, all night long

[Chorus]
How can I forget you in the morning?
How can I forget you?
I was dreaming you were standing there wearing my t-shirt
Wishing that you could still be here
How can I forget? I can't, I can't
How can I forget? I can't, I can't

[Bridge]
You wore that white sundress, smoked a clove cigarette
Danced barefoot and your hair was a mess
Let you slip through my fingers but you're stuck in my head
And I'll be thinking 'bout you for so long, for so long

[Chorus]
How can I forget you in the morning?
How can I forget you?
I was dreaming you were standing there wearing my t-shirt
Wishing that you could still be here
How can I forget? I can't, I can't
How can I forget? I can't, I can't
I was dreaming you were standing there wearing my t-shirt
Wishing that you could still be here
How can I forget? I can't, I can't
How can I forget? I can't, I can't
How can I forget?
