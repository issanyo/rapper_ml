[Verse 1: Tank]
I let her get to the top, I let her fuck up the streets
I let her flip up the work, I let her get it all week
I let he pull up her dress, I let her show me that ass
I let her twerk on the seats, I let 'em sit on the glass
I let her put it in drive, I let her work with the stick
I let her do tricks with the ride, look how she work with the stick
I let her open her mouth, I let her put somethin' in
I let her do what she want  and I let her do it again
Yeah, she a pretty lil thing, but a real go getter
The kind that won't sing, you can do dirt with her
She wanted a boss, it don't get no bigger
Beat it up 'til the morning, she ain't a quitter
