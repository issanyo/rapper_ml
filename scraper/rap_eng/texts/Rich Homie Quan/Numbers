[Intro]
I run up that money again
I'm in buffalo ‘cause I want me some bills
Nigga talking shit, but they don't want it with Quan
Got 99 bands, so what?

[Hook]
Hundred thousand dollars in ones, I throw 'em
Fifty thousand dollars in fives, I blow 'em
Two hundred thousand dollars in tens, I do it
A million dollars in hundreds, I swear I ran through 'em
Say my prayers every night ‘cause I know that I sin
Gotta keep that shit 100 like my nigga Ben
Jamie Foxx, Willie Beamen, boy you number ten
I'm in that liquor store, posted like a pack of skins
Talk to 'em Quan

[Verse 1]
If you talking 'bout them M's, boy I need a dozen
I ain't know we were related, but I hit my cousin
I ain't tryin' to do no datin', so I skipped the subject
Shorty say that she gon' tell her big brother
I told that lil bitch, "Go and tell your big brother"
Leave him stanking with a smell, but I won't get in trouble
Already five M's, tryin' to get another
My boy got three times ten for a fucking murder
Stay in the pen with my nigga, just like Bobby Shmurda
She got to doing her business, so I closed the curtains
Might fuck that hoe and then pretend I don't know the person
I spent like nine or like ten on my last purchase
I got pulled over again and I ain't even servin'
Shorty acting like a kid, that's why [?] nurseries
I've been tryin' to get it in, overtime on first shift
All my kids look just like me, you would think I birthed 'em
They wanna be just like Daddy, so it's me they worship
I got lawyers on my team and I also got nurses
Shorty she know she a ten like a fucking Percocet
Might be in them trees, blended, 'cause them niggas lurkin'

[Hook]
Hundred thousand dollars in ones, I throw 'em
Fifty thousand dollars in fives, I blow 'em
Two hundred thousand dollars in tens, I do it
A million dollars in hundreds, I swear I ran through 'em
Say my prayers every night ‘cause I know that I sin
Gotta keep that shit 100 like my nigga Ben
Jamie Foxx, Willie Beamen, boy you number ten
I'm in that liquor store, posted like a pack of skins
Talk to 'em Quan

[Verse 2]
2009, swag surfing like you Roscoe Dash
2009, all chain, boy let's pocket cash
Shoot him up, leave him bleeding like a Maxi Pad
Uncle Sam might need my money so I tax his ass
When I was lil I had a crush on that hoe Stacey Dash
I am not Illuminati, I'm a Mason, man
I wear green, they salute me like I'm Major Payne
If you got caught by the police, yeah, don't say my name
I done cheated once again, give me a second chance
I shoot up all your spots, I'm the Leopard Man
Got all this gold on my neck like it's treasure, man
Offshore accounts overseas, embezzlement
Tryin' to assassinate me like J.F. Kennedy
Pocket fat, rest in peace Heavy D
Whoa whoa whoa, so so so
Go go go hard on these niggas, Quan
No no no, never go broke
I love my niggas, I put my house up 'fore he burn
She don't talk much like a Nun, gotta [?] till my children get it
Tell me, what's fifty plus fifty?

[Hook]
Hundred thousand dollars in ones, I throw 'em
Fifty thousand dollars in fives, I blow 'em
Two hundred thousand dollars in tens, I do it
A million dollars in hundreds, I swear I ran through 'em
Say my prayers every night ‘cause I know that I sin
Gotta keep that shit 100 like my nigga Ben
Jamie Foxx, Willie Beamen, boy you number ten
I'm in that liquor store, posted like a pack of skins
