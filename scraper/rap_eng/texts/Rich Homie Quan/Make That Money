[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
Got a penthouse sitting by the lake
Don’t let my shrimp touch the steak
Got the trap house beating like they
They trying to slide on a young nigga safe
Fucking four hoes feeling like a pimp
That's a dip when I walk not a limp
That's a forty hanging off my hip
Fuck around get shot, y'all niggas ain't real
I'm just trynna get some money
Make that money, Make that money, Make that money
I'm just trynna get some money
Take that money, Take that money, Take that money
I'm just trynna get some money
Whole lotta money, Whole lotta money, Whole lotta money
I'm just trynna get some money
Work for this money, Work for this money, Work for this money baby!

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Spent 3200 on shoes last week, bought just two pair
I'm in the big boy Presidential Suite, bet you can't guess who there?
And I got like 4 or 5 freaks said molly and they said oh yeah
Cuz a bitch'll do anything for me with my finger and she said go well.(go well)
Im somewhere sitting with my feet up
Imma get it right back in Ariba
Don't follow that crowd, be a leader
Imma school these niggas I'm a teacher
Can't fool me nigga, you see through
I do this nigga I'm legal
Yo bitch fucking me holling free you
Got my stick in her face like Kiku
If you ain't know nigga, that's Chinese food
Name a crew who can do it like we do
AC blowing on a nigga, I'm 3-cool
It's only one of me be you
She a runaway if she get loose
And I'm on a runaway sipping on juice
With my mind on one thang, trying to get some loot
When she see the top floor view

I been fucking this new ho that I just met, going on 2 weeks
The bitch really moving to fast, ho already in to deep
She been sucking on dick to long, got black all around her knees
I don't know what type of shit she on
When she suck it, she'll make a nigga scream!
I won that game, nigga you loss
Buckin' on two cops
Stay down from the bottom young nigga
Now I'm standing on the rooftop
Got money in the shoebox
Never flex what you got
Fuck around get you shot
I got two Glocks
It's me against the world, nigga feeling like 2Pac
Who hot? Nigga, you not
I needa more space, got 2 spots
And I don't give a fuck who you are
And I got 4 doors, 2 cars
And I'm doing more shows than you thought
And I'm on that road, getting money
Sold out shows, for Rich Homie
Nigga, ask your ho, she know me
She was at my!
