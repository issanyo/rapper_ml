[Verse 1: Jacquees]
Tell me why you wanna be bad (bad)
Tell me why you wanna be bad babe (bad babe)
Sweating while you calling me daddy (daddy)
Givin you the best you ever had babe (had babe)
Make me feel like you ain't never had it (had it)
Stretching you out like you are elastic (elastic)
Turn around, poke it out so I can grab it (grab it)
Flip that ass over like we in gymnastics (gymnastics, gymnastics)
Uh ah baby tell me that you want it deeper
I don’t never wanna come out
Put you in a coma, yeah a sleeper

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
Tell me do you wanna be bad
Tell me do you wanna be bad babe
With the shots, pow pow, you bust off like a uzi
Think I’m gonna need another mag babe
Back that ass up on me like I’m Juvie
Bout nothing but action in this movie
It’s going down, turn around, let me feel yo booty
I’ma private in your parts,
I’m at duty, girl give it to me
Uh ah baby you remind me of my jeeper
The way your body's bouncing up and down
Feels like a tsunami or Katrina
I swear I am deep enough to drown, oh girl

Take it to the whole play, D up, why she want me on D?
Easy on my free throw (swish) take it I'm a d-boy (hahaha)
Talking bout girlfriends when you know a young nigga got like 3 of them (I got like 3)
And you so insecure about that lil' shit
Damn why a nigga can't see others? (oh no oh no)
Damn why we can't just be lovers, till the end, of time
I fuck wit' you forever (forever)
Little friend, of mine (of mine)
Lets bring this shit together
Make you feel it in yo belly
I can't sing this shit no better
I'mma hit like a pedal so we make it last forever

[Outro: Rich Homie Quan]
Hit you from the back i know that I'm gon make you feel it
Hey damn right too

Hit you from the back, hit you from the back
I might hit you from the back i know that I'm gon make you feel it

Hit you from the back I'm gon make you feel it
I know that I'm gon make you feel it (feel it)
