[Intro: Doe B]
Karltin
Yeah, cut the beat up in my ear, just the music
Ain't never too much music, feel that shit
Uh yeah, uh yeah, uh yeah, uh yeah

[Hook: Doe B]
I got too many hoes, I got too many foes
Too many fake ass friends, these niggas all clones
I got too many shows, I’m always on the road
I got on too much ice, that’s why my heart so cold
I got too many problems, that ain't gon let it stop me
Ain’t worried bout no niggas, I got too many choppas
Ain’t worried bout no bitches, I got too many options
And money’s not a issue, ain’t never too much money

[Verse 1: Doe B]
Nah ain't never too much paper, ain’t never too much paper
That white man my best friend, can't never call me racist
Never too many haters, I need my motivation
Ain’t never too much swag dawg, never too much flavor
I got on too much ice, that’s probably why they hate me
My chain fa ya life, this for you so called takers
I keep that bitch off safety, too many niggas flaky
These niggas all clones dawg, too many niggas fakin'
And most these niggas basic, I’m extraordinary
Them Pradas, got no laces, my watch and charm canary
And I’m a living legend, real talk I should have been buried
Aye, I’ve been through it all dawg, the streets say I’m the realest

[Hook: Doe B]
I got too many hoes, I got too many foes
Too many fake ass friends, these niggas all clones
I got too many shows, I’m always on the road
I got on too much ice, that’s why my heart so cold
I got too many problems, that ain't gon let it stop me
Ain’t worried bout no niggas, I got too many choppas
Ain’t worried bout no bitches, I got too many options
And money’s not a issue, ain’t never too much money

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Ridin' round with them shooters, rich niggas smoke Cubans
Fake nigga talk about it, real nigga go through it
We gon shoot this movie, I got a starting role, so you know me
I turnt up in Alabama, it's Rich Homies and Doe B
And we fo' deep, ridin' around, buckin' on the city police
I’m ballin on 'em cost ballin' on 'em
Ya bih wanna fuck me for no reason
Get chopped and screwed like oh nigga
Hell nah, bitch I don’t know
Should’ve learned yo lesson, I ain't been connected
Yea better call them phone people
And all this shit I do, I swear I do for you
Them shows on the road get old, need a girl I can come home to
And I ain’t playin shawty, cause I do this on the regular
No free time, full schedule

[Hook: Doe B]
I got too many hoes, I got too many foes
Too many fake ass friends, these niggas all clones
I got too many shows, I’m always on the road
I got on too much ice, that’s why my heart so cold
I got too many problems, that ain't gon let it stop me
Ain’t worried bout no niggas, I got too many choppas
Ain’t worried bout no bitches, I got too many options
And money’s not a issue, ain’t never too much money
