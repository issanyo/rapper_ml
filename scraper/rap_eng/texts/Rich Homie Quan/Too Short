[Intro]
Yeah, Rich, Homie, Quan
Yeah nigga
I left the car runnin’ outside

[Hook]
All my bitches pussy ballin' (Too Short, Too Short)
Money long, I like tall bread (Too Short, Too Short)
I call all my hoes bitch, just like I'm Too Short
Going broke, I never get
Like Too Short Too Short

[Verse]
Money longer than a freeway
I'm in the foreign car and I'm speedin’
Never listen to what he say
You broke nigga that the reason
And then I ran it up like a relay
I won nigga, now I'm eating
And y'all niggas, can't beat me
Y'all niggas, can't see me
Cause my money up and my tummy tucked
It’s gettin’ colder, by the season
And 100 bucks, it was fronted first
But now I'm older and I see it
Money growin', no teacher
Had to teach myself how to get me some money
Going broke? I don't see it
A gotta couple hustles, gotta keep me somethin

[Bridge]
You might beat me down but can't beat this gun
Ridin’ Round with that ski mask on cause I need me some
Told 12 fuck him around the right, don't read me nothin'
And I keep me a gun, I need my money
Pockets got the mumps now
Left the car runnin, jumped out
When I

[Pre-Hook]
Pulled up, new car
Old money, got a New Broad
Been the same nigga since day 1
We’ve been kicking it since we were newborns
Talking spaz nigga I got two warnings
You ain't hot nigga, you lukewarm
And I got it girl, what you gonna do it for it?
My money long never Too Short..

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I front you them bands, you came up too short with my money
Yes, I came up to get my cash
Cause like Too Short, I hold them grudges
And I smell with you when everything pretty
Take off when it get ugly, disgusted
Can't even look at you when I'm in public
But that's nothin’
I done seen my partners kill some niggas just over discussion
And those same partners held it down, none of them got busted
Never changed partners, stick to the G code
That's why I trust you and love you
Its only one thing I'll always put above you
And that’s that money baby
Ben Frank, I done made more then 100 baby
I'm on the come up baby, I can't fumble baby
Even though wishin’ on me
Brand new car, window still got the sticker on it
