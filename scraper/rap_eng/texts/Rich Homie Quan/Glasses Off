Rich Homie babe

I'm Rich Homie babe

I'm so Rich Homie babe

I had to take my glasses off
'cause I couldn't see you and believe it
And my homie lyin'
Had to see with my own eyes
But now I got my glasses off
See the attitude through my mean eyes (I see it nigga)
Look a man straight in the eyes
To prove that he ain't lying
And that's the reason my glasses off

Now you see that's soft
Where I'm comin' from
Least they come, nigga front for nothin'
That's when they see that boy
But I ain't mad at all
When somethin' got my sights slightly trippin' (what's that?)
My glasses off - wipe my lenses, for brighter vision

Now I must speed, I think that Porsche coupe not fast enough
So don't  fuck with me, now a nigga in court, for shootin' no basketball
Now I love to see Millie out that nasty place, it been a little minute 'cause
His assault was aggravated, he was caught on camera ragin'
But I feel that shit was fed up
First heard guilty, stood up and took my glasses off
Fuckin' disbelief, prayin' disagree, when I know it ain't
Like a missin' piece, somethin' incomplete, puzzle played

Talked to homie just the other day, my check
I can see it on his mother's face, she under stress
And her heart ache, for God's sake, the note on her car late
I got a fetish for Dolce, but

I had to take my glasses off
'cause I couldn't see you and believe it
And my homie lyin'
Had to see with my own eyes
And now I got my glasses off
See the attitude through my mean eyes (I see it nigga)
Look a man straight in the eyes
To prove that he ain't lying
And that's the reason my glasses off

Now you see that's soft
Where I'm comin' from
Least they come, nigga front for nothin'
That's when they see that boy
But I ain't mad at all
When somethin' got my sights slightly trippin' (what's that?)
My glasses off - wipe my lenses, for brighter vision

Okay now vision 20/20, I see everything
I was chillin' at Gucci Villa
He pulled over my Grand Mustang
Conversation, that's our business
Ain't for pulling your nigga home game
And he money, where we gettin'?
I swear, got a young nigga paid

And I swear, got a young nigga made
I got a driver, ain't lyin', when he be drivin'
He by flyin', you wanna find him?
He's on time, he my nigga, (Rich Homie)
And we straight, we forever, (never dyin')
I pray, some day we make one play and we
Gotta come straight, wanna hear Quan say, okay okay

I like him, go skirt, go and have 'em all
Handkerchief for my lenses, hoe
My vision blurry, glasses off
I need cash to call (I swear I do)
'cause all these hoes can't hear from me
Like why these hoes be after me
I can barely see, so

I had to take my glasses off
'cause I couldn't see you and believe it
And my homie lyin'
Had to see with my own eyes
And now I got my glasses off
See the attitude through my mean eyes (I see it nigga)
Look a man straight in the eyes
To prove that he ain't lying
And that's the reason my glasses off

Now you see that's soft
Where I'm comin' from
Least they come, nigga front for nothin'
That's when they see that boy
But I ain't mad at all
When somethin' got my sights slightly trippin' (what's that?)
