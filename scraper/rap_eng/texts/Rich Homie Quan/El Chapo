[Chorus:]
Daddy said bitches is hoes, I just want you be honest
I love all of my bros, I bought all of them choppas
Nigga I'll die for my dawg, today or tomorrow
I woke up a boss I feel like El Chapo
Nigga I feel like El Chapo
Nigga I feel like El Chapo
I woke up I feel like El Chapo
Nigga I feel like El Chapo, I feel like El Chapo

[Verse 1: Trav]
All of my niggas is bastards, I created a monster
My niggas built me a tunnel to get me up out here
I am prepared for war, I'm down for it all
[?] that's all, [?] went off
I am a man on a mission, I grew up so different
I had work on a scale in my grandma kitchen
I used to chef it up now I got workers for me
Got niggas put work in for me that's coming to knock you off
I feel [?] in the [?], [?] in a soda
And it's over
What you want me to do ,when your back against the wall and they counting on you

[Chorus:]
Daddy said bitches is hoes, I just want you be honest
I love all of my bros, I bought all of them choppas
Nigga I'll die for my dawg, today or tomorrow
I woke up a boss I feel like El Chapo
Nigga I feel like El Chapo
Nigga I feel like El Chapo
I woke up I feel like El Chapo
Nigga I feel like El Chapo, I feel like El Chapo

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
I feel like El Chapo boy
Only difference is nigga I ain't locked up
If I was boy my boys would get me out the same way
I'm not El Chapo but you know I got them dollars and you know I got them choppas
So lil bitch stay out my way
El Chapo with that cocaine, El Chapo with that dope
El Chapo with that money, El Chapo Mexico
El Chapo with that money, El Chapo with that dope
Red, white, green flag El Chapo Mexico
Got my strap by my dick won't shoot myself no Plaxico
I don't scrap bout no bitch nigga I rather let her go
Keep this money by all means who told you [?]

[Chorus:]
Daddy said bitches is hoes, I just want you be honest
I love all of my bros, I bought all of them choppas
Nigga I'll die for my dawg, today or tomorrow
I woke up a boss I feel like El Chapo
Nigga I feel like El Chapo
Nigga I feel like El Chapo
I woke up I feel like El Chapo
Nigga I feel like El Chapo, I feel like El Chapo
