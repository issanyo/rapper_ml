[Intro]
30 you a fool for this one
Cheeze

[Chorus]
Aye, I finally made my mind up that I can’t go back broke
They sayin’ that my time up, my back against the ropes
I hustle got my grind up, that when I made the most
I had faith every night and I never lost no hope
Nobody gave me a chance but I believed in myself
I tried to lend ‘em a hand when they needed my help
Rubberband on that bankroll, bae I will never fold
For all the money in the world, wouldn’t sign my soul

[Verse 1]
Yeah never sold my soul for no money, it ain’t worth it
Sent a message 911, say, "Hit me back, it’s urgent"
Shawty bad as hell like she need to be in nursery
VVSs shinin’ boy, them diamonds lookin’ perfect
We just pop some Adderall, I’m up and I can’t doze off
12 up the street, I’m drivin' fast and it’s a roadblock
The feds pullin’ up, they takin’ pictures wit they phone out
I can’t put my trust in no man, I’m on my own now
Diamonds on my left hand, married to the game
When I shoot it wit my left hand, this bih hard to aim
Had to show them folk my serious face 'cause they think I be playin’
At first they ain’t get it but now they understand

[Chorus]
I finally made my mind up that I can’t go back broke
They sayin’ that my time up, my back against the ropes
I hustle got my grind up, that when I made the most
I had faith every night and I never lost no hope
Nobody gave me a chance but I believed in myself
I tried to lend ‘em a hand when they needed my help
Rubberband on that bankroll, bae I will never fold
For all the money in the world, wouldn’t sign my soul

[Verse 2]
Illuminati callin’, I would never sell my soul dawg
Too much of this money, gotta give some to my road dawg
Shawty sniffin’ cane and she 'bout to blow her nose dawg
When she suck my dick, I swear she damn near ripped my soul out
We been in the club on day shift, we been throwin’ off
Ran out of ones on day shift, they thought I throwed it all
Knot off in my pocket pokin’ out just like a bowling ball
We got guns too, let’s go to war
Gotta stay a boss because my role important
I see the words so I narrate the story
Just like a mirror, got a face the target
I’m doin' me but they gon' hate regardless
"Gotta put that money in the safe," that’s what I say to shorty

[Chorus]
I finally made my mind up that I can’t go back broke
They sayin’ that my time up, my back against the ropes
I hustle got my grind up, that when I made the most
I had faith every night and I never lost no hope
Nobody gave me a chance but I believed in myself
I tried to lend ‘em a hand when they needed my help
Rubberband on that bankroll, bae I will never fold
For all the money in the world, wouldn’t sign my soul
