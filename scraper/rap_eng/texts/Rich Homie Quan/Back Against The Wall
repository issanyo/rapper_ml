[Verse]
I want that money
I want that Fetty
I want them hunnas
I want that lettuce
Blue new money, shoutout to the teller
Shoutout to the OG, shoutout to the letters
Shoutout to the quiet nigga, shoutout to the reverend
Shoutout to the 2 3 5, that's a 7
Shoutout to the Lord I ain't fucking with the devil
I ain't fucking with no niggas, until I get rich
Whole lotta money over here wanna count it
Whole lotta drugs I got them over the counter
Diamonds looking like water out the fountain
Louis V pyjamas for when a nigga lounging
Coming direct nigga ain't no way around it
Diamonds so wet I'm damn near drowning
Don't want shit to do with my ex, I don't care nun bout her
And I swear to God can't turn my blunt down this shit getting louder
Took off with all of my relationships I got out of
When you get money seem like you gain a whole load of power
Ran my check up now these niggas sour

[Chorus]
With my back against the wall, who am I to call?
A lawyer said a couple racks will get him out
He don't care to charge it, he'll be home today
I pray my lawyer beat my case (I'm on my knees praying)
I pray my lawyer beat my case (I pray my lawyer beat my case)
There's no light hitting my face (Fuck the judge and the DA)
I pray my lawyer beat my case, my lawyer beat my case
I pray my lawyer beat my case
