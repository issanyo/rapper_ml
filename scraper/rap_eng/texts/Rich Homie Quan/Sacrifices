[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Well...
I'm in L.A. at a Laker game on court side- midfield, nigga
You still lame, I won't deal wit ya
Makin' music for the real nigga
Earned money, me no Hilfiger
Ask Donald Trump, I want his figures
He's 28, put a kick in him [?]
Rich Homie. No bitch in him
I've been diagnosed straight spittin' venom
You need bifocals just to see in it
Tent doggin' we smoke that [?]
I told my girlfriend that I'ma see women
If he snitchin'
You'll never see me wit' him
Cause I trick him
Like a motherfucking flea flicker
But I'm frying these niggas- no skillet
And I'm killing these niggas- no bullet
But my wrist all frozen [?] like a bald head
In the winter time with no skully
I'm handicapped
I need crutches
I'm leaning
Grab a box of them Dutches
Cause we gon' need them

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
When I'm on that syrup, they can't understand a thing I say
I smoke a blunt everyday to take the pain away
I need to see a doctor fast and I hate to say
That nobody ain't give me shit, I had to make a way
For my niggas and my crew
I don't know about you
And this shit I went through
I refuse to go through
Hey, to get where I'm at, it took sacrifices
And it ain't worth having if you don't sacrifice it

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
I'm at the top, they at the bottom where beginners lay
A sacrifice for my family I take any day
I go to court on his behalf, just to see her face
She killed my partner cold blood on that December day
And this is where I stay
And it don't need renovation
I think I'm going crazy
Like a mental patient
Give that ho a oscar
Cause she stay acting crazy
And I'm feeling myself (ha!)
Like a straitjacket, baby
Got these hundreds on me
I don't know which one to touch
All these bitches on me
I don't know which one to fuck
[?]
Before I can't identify my cup
And I'm authorized to stunt

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
