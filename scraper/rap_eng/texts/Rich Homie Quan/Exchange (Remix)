[Intro]
I know everybody then rip this beat
But I'm come with like a whole different approach
Yeah like when my heart get broken
(this is what i do)

[Verse 1]
This what happen when I drink my juice
Double cup I'm sipping, yeah
Actavis it's getting rare
Next time we fuck have a threesome with them bitches, yeah
Drop down on my knees every night and say a sinner's prayer
Lord please save her for me
Natural, don't do no make up for me
I make it rain in every club
So I guess you got a table for me
Cause them hoes I got them waiting on me
That double cup you know it's waiting for me
Half a pint I poured up
Can't live life sober
Big money like Oprah, while smoking on Color Purple
Bout to go back to my old self
Start fucking my old hoes
You say you love me
You say it's fuck the niggas that came way before me
Ain't nothing change about homie
But he was still lame before me
I told her bring a four way
In a hotbox with a throwaway
Assault with aggravation
No gun, that's a closed case
Shawty swing my way
He a scrub, he ain't got nothing on me
So I got tell her
I be on some hot shit
Don't be scared, just be down to do some hot shit
I need a rider that's gonna do whatever I say
Suck that dick anywhere when I say
Don't be afraid what they think about baby
Cause they probably do it too
Don't be worried about them hoes
Cause I know they do it too
Them the same hoes you call yo friends
Want to get in with me
But I ain't tell you
Cause I'm loyal, can't let them get in with me
How that look?
When I love you
Now foreal baby, just chill baby
Cause I gotchu
Don't drink that drank if that motherfucker don't come with
No double seal baby
Foreal baby
Be careful the fake zans going around too
Every nigga ain't yo friend watch who around you
I see you calling, hold up wait stay on line 2
These hoes with all that make up look like clown fools (HaHa)
Laughing real loud even though this ain't important
Wait, let me tell the story
Had the bitch in my room the other day
Went to sleep, should have that shit off
Cause it was on my pillow not her face
Now that say alot about her
I'm mad at her
That shit wouldn't even be there if you was natural
But you claim that you was Asian
Naw that's Asian hair in your head
Play me just like I'm scared
Play me you end up dead
Stutter, stutter  twice, double ice
What you thinking for
Alot of niggas dying drinking that bullshit(Stay safe homie)
Be careful who sell it to you (Naw, that's real)
Be careful who sell it to you
Don't buy that motherfucker it ain't got no seal
Don't try that motherfucker, I'm telling real
(I know you ain't listening)
Lying ass nigga he telling you fibs
Still on that tripping shit
You be on that bitching shit
Every time you call my phone and I don't pick
Funny how you miss me now
But you be acting different now
Every since you got around the new hoes
Ian got be specific now
You know tripping about
I'm bitching about them new clothes
That you bought without asking me baby
I ain't crazy
I should cut off the bank account we was sharing
I [?] thanking
I was banking
Trying to get me some money
I had a thang for Candace
I had  to tell her this
Shawty swing my way
I like the way the song play
When I was littly my mommy told me
Sing it away listen to Escape
Running from my problems and excitement
When I was little I had a thang for Tiny
And I wanted tell her
Shawty swing my way
Shawty swing my way
Shawty swing my way
Shawty swing my way
Shawty swing my way
Shawty swing my way
Shawty swing my way
