[Rich Homie Quan talking:]
Daddy this one here is for you

[Verse 1]
Daddy
I had just got off the plane I needed some sleep
Montae kept calling my phone , repeatedly
I didn't wanna talk I ignored his call cause I was sleepy
Then when I picked up at 2 p.m
He told me my daddy had got shot, 4 times
Immediately tears start coming down my eyes
And I started crying
Cause I ain't know if he was gon make it
Them hospital folks weren't sayin shit
I was just tryna be patient
When I seen him in that ICU
Boy you know I went crazy
Cause I couldn't see my daddy like that , that's my baby (my daddy)
In other words he my best friend talk to him daily (okay)
Them niggas who did it to him , I hope they praying (To who ?)
To God but he can't help you in this situation

[Verse 2:]
I lost my mind when it happened at first
Dropped down straight to my knees
And told God I'm glad I serve him
See them tubes in his mouth yeah,it sadly hurt me
My mind I won't tryna lost
I was ready to kill any person
Anybody who had anything to do with it
Im by myself I don't need no help , no crew with me
Shot your daddy in the barbershop , nigga how would you feel ?
I pray that my daddy hang out, walk around for the rest of his life wit a limp
(What the news say ? )
They hit him in his side 4 times
Talk to him today , he said he walking with his head up so high
Asked him how he made it through it ?
He said one word : GOD
Pulling up like the Mob
I know that he hurting but I just want to let you know
