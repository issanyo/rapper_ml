[Intro]
Man, I've been down so much, bro
Y'all wouldn't even understand the half of it, you feel me?
Y'all don't know about being on section 8 and shit bout that, bro
Insane shit man, three days straight man, for real

[Chorus]
I've been here so much I forgot what the top looked like
Convertible 442, forgot what the top looked like
Little shorty ass so fat I forgot what the top was like
Beat that pussy, boxing fight
Don't talk to cowards, I am Austin Powers
Nigga I done found my mojo, I done found my mojo
I done found my, found my mojo (That's right too)
I done found my mojo, I done found my mojo
I done found my mojo

[Verse 1]
I say that mojo show the inside
Ain't got nothing to [?], ain't got nothing to [?], but
Keep your confidence up cause, a lot of niggas they might try you
My personality is different from my mojo, I divide them
Light a nigga up like a firetruck
[?]
If a nigga try and run off, we gon find him
If a nigga get away, we gone tie his ass up
We gon' put him in the truck, we gon' hide him
I used to get paid seven dollars every hour
Now a nigga get paid by the thousand
Fuck that, I'm a millionaire now
Got a Versace robe just so I can lounge in it
Pounding that pussy, fuck speed limit
Bought it just so I can motherfucking clown in that Bentley
I ain't been around in a minute, but that don't mean I wasn't working
I was just holding it down for my niggas, more money, problems right quick
I had to make it from the bottom like this, cause...

[Chorus]
I've been here so much I forgot what the top looked like
Convertible 442, forgot what the top looked like
Little shorty ass so fat I forgot what the top was like
Beat that pussy, boxing fight
Don't talk to cowards, I am Austin Powers
Nigga I done found my mojo, I done found my mojo
I done found my, found my mojo (That's right too)
I done found my mojo, I done found my mojo
I done found my mojo

[Verse 2]
Fuck her good and she send them kissy faces
I ain't never lose my mojo, I probably just misplaced it
Separate myself, I'm solo, they mad, see it in they faces
Yeah I'm talking bout them haters, yeah I'm talking bout them haters
And my car have these cameras cause that bitch ain't got no roof
And my niggas they gon' go on Simon says, boy, they gone shoot
And I just relapsed, I'm back off that drank, I'm on that juice
And I still drop them old names, still reminiscing 'bout Troupe
I just got my mojo back, I feel like Austin Powers felt
Money hold my pants up, so why the fuck I need a belt?
Cook that work, don't need a chef
So much money, my bag swollen
Watching out for these haters, I'm keeping my eyes open, ayy!

[Chorus]
I've been here so much I forgot what the top looked like
Convertible 442, forgot what the top looked like
Little shorty ass so fat I forgot what the top was like
Beat that pussy, boxing fight
Don't talk to cowards, I am Austin Powers
Nigga I done found my mojo, I done found my mojo
I done found my, found my mojo (That's right too)
I done found my mojo, I done found my mojo
I done found my mojo
