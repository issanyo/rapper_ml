[Rich Homie Quan]
Shawty put her head on my Snickers', I told shawty ain't no caramel in it
I keep me some pieces just like Reeses, No Halloween but I gotta get some Maryjane with me
No Teeth, Licking Hard Candy
Whole Lotta Bitches all on my Jolly Rancher
You say you need some space, Imma Kit-Kat break it
You ain't lovin' I'm gon' Chic-o-stick take it
Sweet tooth for that sweet pussy cause I'm nasty
She wants a sugarbaby but im not even her sugardaddy (haha)
I love candy, but not that much
Shawty ass shaped like at gram cracker
Flat butt, Stayed in the house till i got my cash up
Jacquees! Tell them what it is, we did it again (haha)
Girl you know your body taste like candy

[Verse 1]
Girl your body is legit
Mama made you thick
Don't know why you wonder why them other ho's talk shit
I see sex in your eyes
Sex between your thighs
I don't play no games
You're my candy crush all night
Can I put my face in your water
I know it's out of order
He can't do the things that I do
Know the tricks that I knew
Don't know why you acting brand new ooooh hoo hoo

[Hook]
She can't get the Snickers from another nigga
She know what I did with the Twix
My ex-girlfriend can't stand her
Cause a new man hit her with that Jolly Rancher
And I want ya, call me your Willy Wonka
And I want ya, call me your Willy Wonka
And I want ya, call me your Willy Wonka
Yeah I know they after me
I got that Chocolate factory
Come thru, come thru lil mama come thru
If you know what's good for you
If you know what's good for you
Come thru, come thru lil shawty come thru
If you know what's good for you
If you know what's good for you

[Verse 2]
Girl your body is legit
Mama made you thick
Don't know why you wonder why your ex man so sick
She want Pretty Ricky and Plies, everytime she rides
Back shots to Jodeci, that's 9 to 5 all night
Don't really know if I love her, but I love when she's going under
Taste like Aquafina baby, '98 Trina!
Girl, I want you three back in, I'll get a 2 liter of you

[Hook]
She can't get the Snickers from another nigga
She know what I did with the Twix
My ex-girlfriend can't stand her
Cause a new man hit her with that Jolly Rancher
And I want ya, call me ya Willy Wonka (Willy Wonkaa)
And I want ya, call me ya Willy Wonka (Willy Wonkaa)
And I want ya, call me ya Willy Wonka (Willy Wonkaa)
