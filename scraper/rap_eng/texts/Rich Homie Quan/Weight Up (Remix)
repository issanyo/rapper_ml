[Intro]

[Bridge]
I done finally got my weight up
Got my weight up
Got my weight up
Got my weight up
Got my weight up
Got my motherfucking weight up

[Hook]
See, I done finally got my weight up
Got my weight up
Got my weight up
On them nights, see I would stay up
For that motherfucking paper
Asking god for a way up
For a war I gotta stay up
And I ain't never lived for the dime bell
But I done got my fuckin' weight up
Got my weight up
Got my weight up
Got my weight up
Got my weight up
Got my weight up
Got my motherfuckin' weight up
I'm gon' stay up
I'm gon' stay up
I'm gon' stay up
I'm gon' stay up
I'm gon' stay up
That's a message to my motherfuckin' haters

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
See I remember at first
Everybody was sleepin' on me
I tried to wake them up
But they still went temperpedic on me
My nigga Millie is still 'free the homie'
How the fuck can I go to Hell
With all these baby Jesus on me?
Reefer on me, visa on me, .40 on me
Mo'niffa on me, bitches on me
Niggas lonely, cause I got they ho down
Yo bitch up in that spoe' now
Roll out, full car, deep and switchin' lanes on 'em
Color coated paint on 'em, fuck it, go insane on 'em
All white bucket seats
Same color cocaine homie
And them bitches ain't fuckin' for free
If you met 'em at the flame, homie
Damon Wayans, shame on 'em
I ain't lift the weight, but pounds gained on 'em
And my number still the same on 'em
If you want them thang' from me
You can still get it for the same number
Or cheaper
Cause you know a nigga bitch hit
Ah, bitches are the only thang I bench 'pressed

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jose Guapo]
Lot of niggas ass up like a shape up
Fuck a 9-5 them niggas don't pay enough
The money you know we gonna get it
I'm stylin i'm stylin designer
Hit like mayweather we fighting
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Offset]
Get your weight up cause you dont weight enough
In my G-o it ain't no trailer riding round in spaceships
Im the truth ain't no lie around me all my niggas keep a hundred round clip from around me
Young rich nigga riding round in a Bentley
Hurt a nigga feelings cause im on a hill in Beverly
Drop house look like a bakery
I see u fuck niggas hating know its jealousy
The audi, the Masi; exotic, Bugatti, Ferrari, you niggas is sorry
My niggas they ballin; Amare

[Hook]
