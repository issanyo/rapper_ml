[Verse 1]
I don't talk, I just pull up and show it
Park the car, chaffuer open my door
It's bullshit you talkin', I smell the manure
Shitted on em, I ain't flush tha toilet
Ran out of toilet tissue, wipe my ass with hunnids
Like the repo man, you know I'm coming for you
Every time I hit, she don't wanna fuck the same
I don't know what she feel me but I know [?]

[Hook]
And that's that feeling she get when she see me
And that's that feeling she get when she with me
Talkin' bout that feeling you get when I'm fuckin'
But I can tell 'em about them feelings I get when you touch me
That's that feeling that she love when I beat up that pussy
That's that same feeling hurt that pussy, left her [?]
That's that same feeling she get from me cause I'm different
And all the feelings she'll get if I go missing
And so filling to show her attention

[Verse 2]
Uh, the way you feel about me girl, I feel the same
Don't make no deal about it, money ain't a thang
Give you the house up on that hill in my last name
Promise you can have it all if you never change
I want the keys to your safe deposit box
After that you just might give me the key to your heart
Give me the key to your car, but I don't need 'em, right Quan?
Pull that big auto strap
She get to thinkin' I'm cheating but really I am not
Her friends keep tellin' her I'm cheatin cause they want her spot
Feelings for Rich Homie done got her fucked up
Not in a bad way because I'm starting to say
You can't trust none of these bitches when feelings involved
You can't love none of these bitches when money's involved
Fish that pussy cause I love you even though I'm becoming a dog
Why she huggin me life this? I know why

[Hook]
And that's that feeling she get when she see me
And that's that feeling she get when she with me
Talkin' bout that feeling you get when I'm fuckin'
But I can tell 'em about them feelings I get when you touch me
That's that feeling that she love when I beat up that pussy
That's that same feeling hurt that pussy, left her [?]
That's that same feeling she get from me cause I'm different
And all the feelings she'll get if I go missing
And so filling to show her attention

[Verse 3]
She feel on me like a refrigerator
I'm one feeling where she couped out, eat pussy for dinner
I hit her with that wood, she left cause you let her [?]
Just cause you tottin a gun don't mean you real nigga
I know niggas out of town who'll deal with ya
Knock you out, fly back now they chillin
I don't even need no security, why Quan?
Cause this pistol here secure me

[Hook]
And that's that feeling she get when she see me
And that's that feeling she get when she with me
Talkin' bout that feeling you get when I'm fuckin'
But I can tell 'em about them feelings I get when you touch me
That's that feeling that she love when I beat up that pussy
That's that same feeling hurt that pussy, left her [?]
That's that same feeling she get from me cause I'm different
And all the feelings she'll get if I go missing
And so filling to show her attention
