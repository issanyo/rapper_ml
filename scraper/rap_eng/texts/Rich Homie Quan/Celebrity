Gucci Mane my name, ain't getting in that hood
From Hollywood to Inglewood to Edgewood
I told her I can't fuck with her unless her head good
She said she can't fuck with me less my bread good
RIP to Dom, free my nigga Scooter
Man I just pulled up the crucial and I come back to the future
Exclusive lube is feelin on bitches' booties with juicy juice
Fucked so many hoes in the club, we start a bank in Fiji
Why 6 figures? Move in the 6 figures too
Gucci you nigga you, do it with niggas aye
Yea this deep on metro and the zips goes in the end zone
Touch one button, top I'm punchin, you niggas could never walk around in my retro
It's Gucci

I got different nationalities (foreign)
And they all got similarities
Baby I love your personality (I love it)
And I'm the fame, you the celebrity yea
I got different nationalities (I'm trappin girls)
Got a lot of similarities (and cop that Porsche)
I love a bitch with personality
I'm tryin to make your nigga mad at me, yea

Girl you can tell me what you want
I say can, he say cun (cun)
I do the shit that he doesn't
One check, one bank, he checks his money
You see his choppas in these bags
You see my choppas in the front (foreign shit)
I say blunt, you say joint (joint?)
Spikes on my shoes, look like I pun
Got these white Forgies like I hunt (I'm deer huntin)
Evil Knievel, I do stunts
Why so evil? Call the priest (hallelujah)
So pray for me, I'm in the streets
It's Gucci
