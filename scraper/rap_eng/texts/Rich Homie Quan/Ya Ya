I get that money for sure, money stacked up in the house off the shore
I was in Houston fuckin' with lil' Rob
Before all the strippin', before the galore
Before the galore I had millions and more
Before the tour I had been ran it up
Shakin' and shiverin' when I went to court
Take it or give it but I want it all (I want it all)
I'mma take it all, she know I'm gon' do it (I want it all)
Tryna get me a hundred million before I go (I want it all)
Yeah I want it all

Hold up, wait, stop it, hey!
I want it all like I never had it
Never had nothin' don't do no braggin'

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
I put them bricks in the back
I get 'em goin' that's a fact
They know that I'm strapped
I wanna sip on some Act
When I pull up they say no he do that
You know I pay cash, you know I got 2 on the dash
You know all these fuck niggas mad
You know I don't wanna hear nothin' 'bout the shit that you had
And I don't wanna speak on the past, bitch you can't sleep in my pad
All of this ice on me, all of this ice on me bitch let's go eat us some karats
All of this money bring so many problems and I don't need no bitch naggin'
And all of this money, man all of these problems
All problems we gon' be revolvin', and if we revolvin' we gon' solve the problems
And I don't really be cappin'
The time to cap, bitch I'm 'bout the action
When I pull up they gon' know ain't no askin'
Pour up a four then we go and get active

Gotta get full off them muthafuckin' karats
I gotta have it I'm a muthafuckin' savage
Yeah yea
