[Intro]
You the same niggas that came here from the block nigga
Ain't nothin' change but the address nigga

[Hook]
Chances ain't shit if you don't take one
Mansion full of bitches, bout to rape one
I've been eating money like a tapeworm
I've been getting money since day 1
Day 1, day 1, day 1, day 1
Day 1, day 1, day 1, day 1
365 days, but I've been gettin' it since day 1
365 days, but I've been gettin' it since day 1

[Verse 1]
365 that's a whole year
465 days, locked up for more than a whole year
Been guaped up for like 4 years
My partners got like 4 years
I'm guaped up and got no deal
Can't stop us and I'm so forreal
Real leather, baby, how the sofa feels?
I'm tellin' you baby, don't show no feelin's
That the main reason why these bitches hurtin'
And that the main reason why the bitches lurkin'
And that the same reason why the bitches searchin'
For a nigga with some money but it ain't worth it
Get that ho a cup cause I know she thirsty
And my daddy been put me on game ever since day 1
Been (?) when the day comes
Same niggas with me since day 1
And I bet a hundred thou' you don't say nothin'
Can't forget about a .40 cal tucked in my stomach
I used to take chances just to make money
Now I get advances, used to have nothin'
I was blind like I can't see
Til a wise man told me that

[Hook]
Chances ain't shit if you don't take one
Mansion full of bitches, bout to rape one
I've been eating money like a tapeworm
I've been getting money since day 1
Day 1, day 1, day 1, day 1
Day 1, day 1, day 1, day 1
365 days, but I've been gettin' it since day 1
365 days, but I've been gettin' it since day 1

[Verse 2]
Never thought I'd get a million 'til I made one
Never thought I would have children 'til I made one
Asked the Lord to forgive me 'fore my day come
Cause I done did a whole lotta fucked up shit, even been locked up like Akon
I was in the streets, I done made money
My nigga play for keeps, they take money
And if a nigga got beef, better say somethin'
Cause I don't know how you feel fuck nigga
Rich shit I lived up to, big crib I pulled up to
Big fix, can't see what I'm doin'
Just some pitbulls that love to eat humans
Got a Louis, got a Gucci on, mismatched, been kickin' this shit since day 1
And that sideline that I'm fuckin' on a side better not say nothin'
(?) fuck around and make a nigga go and get an AR
And I swear how the world hooded every day since we lost Trayvon
Fuck Zimmerman cause...

[Hook]
Chances ain't shit if you don't take one
Mansion full of bitches, bout to rape one
I've been eating money like a tapeworm
I've been getting money since day 1
Day 1, day 1, day 1, day 1
Day 1, day 1, day 1, day 1
365 days, but I've been gettin' it since day 1
365 days, but I've been gettin' it since day 1
