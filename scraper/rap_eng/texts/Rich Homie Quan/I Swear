[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
My pockets swollen and I’m gone off this Oxycodone
I don’t even know what those do I swear
Im never folding, no bankroll I keep it on me
These niggas know I ain’t playing I swear
Walked off in Louis dropped like 50k just in bags that work got me up
Shoot up your spot faster than a cheetah
Playing with that money I don’t wanna meet her but I did

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Came from the trenches, you can’t blame me
Bitch I’m a wolf can’t tame it
Like on the jungle eat what you kill quench your hunger
Camouflage on the back route
I really live what I rap bout, I bought a jaguar to trap out
Got mega stripes like a tiger leopard skin balenciaga
Christian Loubs don’t do pumas, early 20’s no cougar, thats my lil pet my lil cat
You know dick all that I feed her kick her out don’t need her
These hoes be lying they cheetah
These niggas pussy no kitty, I’m going gritty no pity
Say you want me come get me, Bitch I be all through the city
Champion with my reign, just want the fortune fuck fame
? always stand on my name, going out the same way I came

[Verse 3: Rich Homie]
Biting on my fingers I’m itching, want that paper no icing
Don’t got my cake up these niggas faker than make up
I fuck her just like I’m crazy no condoms she want my baby
Her head make me say my gracious, I swear that shit so amazing
I fuck her all in her face in her throat I make her take it
I love every way she go around me she ain’t gotta fake it
Cause she know I got her back she know rich homie gone be there
Got niggas who rob ya over here,  know niggas who’ll dummy over there
If I change up, tell me would I ever be normal
Stay down til I came up I was underground like Osama
East atlanta blang god cause I’m the one who had [commas?]
Aye, a million dollars at 22
