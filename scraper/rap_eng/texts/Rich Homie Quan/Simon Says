[Intro]
Yeah
Nard & B
Nigga know what the fuck goin’ when they hear that shit
Nah real talk man, I been on this shit nigga
Trenchwerk

[Chorus]
Simon says get the money, so we got enough
We was down bad, didn’t take long to get it up
I told my momma sorry I’ll be back, my pistol tucked
She told me, "Son, I love you, just keep goin’, don’t give it up"
I done been around the world twice but still ain’t seen it all
Left a couple of my partners in the past but I didn’t leave 'em all
I told my dawg, "I’m clutch just like Kobe but I need the ball"
And I told my buddy if he get locked up, don’t worry just give me a call

[Verse 1]
Way before the necklace, way before the goons was watchin’ (yeah yeah)
We weren’t gettin’ no money, me and my brother were clothes swappin’ (yeah yeah)
Keep my business to myself, I heard them niggas name droppin' (fuck them niggas)
I make your problem my problem, we shoot at the same target (fa-fa-fa)
They been hatin’ all round town dawg, prayin’ on my downfall
Thinkin’ this shit sweet, fuck around, I pop up like a groundhog (I will)
Lost it all and got it back, I got another chance (I did)
I rather do it by myself, can’t trust another man (Rich homie)
Girl my shit so fucked up, I prolly won’t trust again (I won't)
She been actin’ stuck up, I must just go bust her friend (I swear)
Thought I wouldn’t never fall in love but I’m gettin’ that rush again (I love you baby)
My pockets on Wheel of Fortune 'cause I don’t know what you sayin'

[Chorus]
Simon says get the money, so we got enough
We was down bad, didn’t take long to get it up
I told my momma, "Sorry, I’ll be back, my pistol tucked"

I done been around the world twice but still ain’t seen it all

And I told my buddy if he get locked up, don’t worry just give me a call

[Verse 2]
They laugh, ooh I swear it feel like I done lived this life before
12 patted me down so in my draws is where I hide the tool (that where I hide it)
Used to get it from my bro but broke, I swear I watched him go
Growin’ up influenced by the streets, what was I to do?
Made so much money, can’t hit a nigga 'cause he might try and sue
And the only time I hold my head down is when I tie my shoe
Better put up that loot, get an umbrella for them rainy days
I start drankin’ that juice, poppin’ them percs, to take that pain away
I know kids lookin’ up to me, I’m the one they wishin’ up to be
Grind hard, always get some money, in this world nothin’ come for free
Simon says do it for ya fam, Simon says better go hard
Simon says don’t spend it all today, better have some for tomorrow

[Chorus]
Simon says get the money, so we got enough
We was down bad, didn’t take long to get it up
I told my momma, "Sorry, I’ll be back, my pistol tucked"
She told me, "Son, I love you, just keep goin’, don’t give it up"
I done been around the world twice but still ain’t seen it all
