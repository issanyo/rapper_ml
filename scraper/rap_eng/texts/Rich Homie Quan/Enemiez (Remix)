[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
I'mma speed out when you need help
I'll hold you tight like a seat belt
Read well, I see in between the lines
I don't want no head wanna hit you from behind
That fake shit killing me
I can't be your friend, so I might as well be your enemy
Because friends don't make love like they didn't know
They don't even look at each other like they didn't know
Outside of your house, bebe, talk to 'em, Keke

[Verse 2: Keke Palmer]
I bite my tongue, it never hurt so bad
Keep wanting you to cross that line
I keep trying to get you to react
It never happens every time

[Pre-Chorus: Keke Palmer]
Now you're flowing through my veins
There's one way to cure this pain
I want you inside of me
Can you fill this empty space?

[Chorus: Keke Palmer]
Whoa-oh-oh
This ain't enough for me
I gotta be honest, I want you to lust for me
And if we're just friends I'd rather be your enemy
So we can do all the things you're holding back from me
So let's be enemies, yeah
I know you keep your friends close
I know you keep your enemies closer, yeah
I know you keep your friends close
I know you keep your enemies closer, yeah

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan + Keke Palmer]
Loved when she got a big butt but
Every time we get arguin' result to rough sex
And I'm talking with a feeling because
Money bring power and friends turn into enemies (enemies)
Peep the same people you bring around
Make sure you watch out for the foes you bring around
So high I can feel the sky
Are you real or not? Keke
I can make you come alive

[Pre-Chorus: Keke Palmer]
Now you're flowing through my veins
There's one way to cure this pain
I want you inside of me
Can you fill this empty space?

[Chorus: Keke Palmer]
This ain't enough for me
I gotta be honest, I want you to lust for me
And if we're just friends I'd rather be your enemy
So we can do all the things you're holding back from me
So let's be enemies, yeah
I know you keep your friends close
I know you keep your enemies closer, yeah
I know you keep your friends close
I know you keep your enemies closer, yeah

[Bridge: Keke Palmer]
I've been on my worst behavior
I want you to punish me
I bet you that I can take it
All this fake shit just ain't enough for me

[Chorus: Keke Palmer]
I gotta be honest, I want you to lust for me
And if we're just friends I'd rather be your enemy
So we can do all the things you're holding back from me
So let's be enemies, yeah
I know you keep your friends close
I know you keep your enemies closer, yeah
I know you keep your friends close
I know you keep your enemies closer, yeah
