[Hook: IamSu]
All eyes on me
I'm just living my life
These niggas gon' see
I know you see me I'm just doin' my thing
All eyes on me
I'm just livin' my life
These niggas gon' see
I know you see me I'm just doin' my thing

[Verse 1: IamSu]
Fucked around and thought you was the only one
I'm never trippin' always switchin'
Let my homies run
I'm hustlin', I'm on a mission, tryna get it done
Cause ain't too many opportunities back where I'm from
Wanna survive in that water, gotta swim with the sharks
Surround yourself with the realest, keep your homies involved
They lookin' at me cause I'm different, I know I'm aware
Type of clothes that I wear, how I'm growin' my hair
How I'm reppin' my city, on the stage I do my dance
However you niggas feel it, it ain't changing the plan
Haters try to stop me, I know where niggas comin' from
I just dropped an album, fuck around and drop another one
It's a bet not a threat
I expect my respect
I've been all around the world but I will not forget
How to live and maintain
Stacking change with the gang, never changing
I'm feelin' like ahhh


[Hook: IamSu]

[Verse 2: Kool John]
It's a couple gold chains on me
Got too many bitches, I ain't never lonely
Got a little asian bitch tryna get the chon-lee
All a nigga really wanted was to get some money, yeah
And oh they still hate the boy
On the paper rider, 'bout the money
I'm the paper boy
Show too much love
Man, you know they gotta hate the boy
Just got paid, I'm on my way to go and make some more
Friends turn fake, I don't think I need to make no more
Got my girl good, give her d
She can take the most (?)
And my rap got these bitches goin' bonkers
I'ma shmopboy
Your favorite (?) is a sponsor
I dump her if the bitch call me baby
I go deep up in the ladies
I'ma light it up like Vegas
You niggas did it for some (?)
Bitches did it for a purpose
When I'm 'round, your nigga nervous

[Hook: IamSu]

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
It's a grand and a bat Ben Frank I'ma hunna
Shawty want it from the back but I ain't gotta condom
On me not a stack now I'm tryna make another
Tell the dj bring it back, and I ain't mothafuckin' started
I'm on my way to club I got a bad little bitch who wanna ride with me
Tell that bitch to bring a friend cause I got IamSu on the side of me
And we'll ride on you niggas
It ain't home plate, but I'll slide on you niggas
And I got work, 9 to 5 on these niggas
Might make your bitch twerk, for like five of my niggas
Yeah like five of my niggas
You the type to get a perm and drop a dime on you niggas
No surveillance camera, but I got my eyes on you niggas
Gimme a Glock 40, he prefer a 9 for a busta
Aye take your eyes off my sister
Lil nigga cause I'm feelin' like ahhh
