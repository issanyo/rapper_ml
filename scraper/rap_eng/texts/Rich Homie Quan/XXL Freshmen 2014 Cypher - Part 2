[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
I remember at first everybody was sleeping on me
I tried to wake 'em up, but they still went Tempur-Pedic on me
My nigga milli is to free the homie
How the fuck can I go to jail with all these baby Jesus' on me?
Reefer on me, visa on me, 40 on me, money on me
Bitches on me, niggas lonely cause I got they ho now
Wait a minute, slow now
Roll that, four cars deep and switching lanes on 'em
Color coded paint on 'em, fuck it, go insane on 'em
All white bucket interior look like cocaine, homie
Bitches ain't fucking for free if you met 'em at the flame, homie
Damon Wayan shame on 'em
I ain't lift a weight, but pounds gain on 'em
My number still the same, homie, if you want no thing from me
You can still get it for the same number
Or cheaper because you know a nigga been check
Up, bitches are the only thing I'm benchpress

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl, bust it open for 'em, real one
Take it to the floor like I spilled some
Pick it up for me real slow
I can tell that you’re a pro
Dollar $ign from L.A, this a freestyle
Just look at my outfit, I’m the shit
I ain’t even rhyme, I don’t give a shit
Me and Rich Homie, man, we been the shit
Caught my nigga Durk in Chicago
My young nigga got all the hoes
My nigga Drama up in ATL
Everywhere I go you smell that weed smell
Taylor Gang Pushaz Ink and you negro
Aye, you hear me on the stereo
Your bitch see me on that video
And I bet she gon’ go

[Interlude: Rich Homie Quan]
Got a girl, gon’ go
I said got a girl, we gon’ go
We got a girl, gon’ go

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
These niggas is bitches, getting info from bitches
Go and tell it to the piggies I'm trying to get riches
And stand on that business
Free bro niggas stitching my kings, I was over
And you lucky one penny, I put two in his lemon
This 4-5 lemon, extended clip for his niggas
He ain’t shit to his niggas , we go ahead and take
From Quan to Ty, a safe’s never safe
Roll out the Glocks and we real with the apes
[?] jewel on the ops, no clue as he dies
ACG free the guys shirt, don’t fuck with the rock
I’m on the block, hoping my tape don’t flop
And it go gold when it drop
I’m not a liar, stuck T in them baggies
And we risking indictment trying to get flyer
Been to first class ticket and united 300 to Riot
Murder, murder, kill kill
In a jam I never squeal
Label only time I deal
I fuck with G’s , B’s, Mos, Kings, Snakes, Fo’s
And other niggas of the mill
Nigga, you don’t know how hunger feel
Treating about a hundred mill on the corner with hundred pills
[?] took them 20 years
And they still doing 20 years
And they ain’t ever seeing 20 years
