Yeah, yeah, hey

[Bridge: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
Paparazzi trying to take pictures
Tell them folk to get the fuck out my face (get the fuck out my face)
I don't fuck with 12
Cause I heard they be listening to a nigga conversation (Motherfuck police)
I fucked a nigga bitch, now he trippin'
Better tell him get the fuck out my face
I got it tucked in my jeans and I got my nigga Thug with me
And he gon' tell you get the fuck out my face

[Hook: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
Boy, get the fuck out my face (get the fuck out my face)
Please get the fuck out my face
Please get the fuck out my face

Someone get him out my face (please get the fuck out my face)
Please get the fuck out my motherfucking face
Please get the fuck out my motherfucking face
Please get the fuck out my motherfucking face
(boy get the fuck out my face)
Please get the fuck out my face

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Hundreds stashed in Robins (hundreds stashed in Robins)
I won’t tell nobody! (I won’t tell nobody!)
I won’t touch your body! (I won’t touch you, baby!)
Ass soft as jelly
I'm the real Tony Montana
I got fifty naked bitches on a banana boat(wow)
Your jewelry sunny, Young Thugger need loc's
My water heavy, I need me a float (brr)
He got them birds in the fender bender (nope)
Thugger let your bitch suck him up in rentals (ooh)
Call me with the deal like a fucking pickle, yeah
I just went platinum like a fucking nickel(mane)
How the hell you think I won't go? (What?)
How the fuck you feel I ain't go?
Everything I say I stand up to it (What?)
Nigga count M’s like he fuckin Jewish!
I can’t read substitute rights (aye)
Get the fuck out my face, or else we fight! (What?)
I hate that we the next superstar boy (why)
If you don’t know why tell them, Quan!

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Get the fuck out my face unless you owe me some money!(get back)
Get the fuck out my face, fuck nigga where the hell
You was at when a nigga had nothing!(where you was at?)
I’m talking when a nigga he was hustling (I was hustling!)
I’m talking about the pork 'n beans and weenies
I was eating every night before the grubbing (before the steak)
I’m talking bout a little money I was getting
'Fore 18 way before the clubbing!
Now I got my sack right, nigga, still in the trap house kitchen
Let some of money come up missing (fa fa)
Fuck around, slap the shit out of all these niggas!
Trap house bunkin' got all these pistols
My nigga Thug wrist broke doing all that whipping (whip whip)
And I got a .44, I ain't gotta call no killer (Naw, nigga!)
More money, more problems, I can solve that issue (let go!)
If it’s off my hip I’mma pull that motherfucker back just like a sling shot
And you ain't hold your homie down like you suppose to(nah)
Cause you ain’t never even heard of a green dot(you don't know)
He ain’t got all that shit he say
He ain’t bout rappers trying to be this way
Please boy, I see folks trying to take pictures so I'm like
Hold up, wait, freeze boy!
