[Hook]
I've been havin' so much on my mind lately I can't even think straight (I can't even think straight)
Grip that muthafuckin' pistol so tight like a muthafuckin' firm handshake (like a handshake)
I don't believe in anything on everything 'cause a lot y'all niggas lyin' these days (a lot of y'all niggas lyin')
I see my baby boys, I know it may seem hard but I gotta make sure family straight
(Rich Homie Baby!)

[Verse 1]
Sometimes it feels like they don't even care about me
I was vulnerable and lonely the whole 15 months I was in  DeKalb County
All blue cutlass call it Carolina
I ain't talkin' no truck you need a path finder
I make her swallow then suck on this pacifier
I'll make a story up just to catch a liar
'Cause I do not want that around me
I'm from East Atlanta residing Fulton County
Eat that pussy like a edible yeah brownie
So when I eat it I get high
Hope you not shy, keep on the lights
Growin' up it was different every night
No steak, it was chicken and rice
Still send traps for the mice
Lot of niggas 'round me yeah they snakes
Keep the grass cut don't be late
Made the money but never changed
I'm tired of holdin' in all this pain
Made a promise to my momma she can get a new house
Escobar money momma she gon' need a new couch
I'm runnin' out places to hide this money I can't think
Where to put it at, ain't nowhere to put it at, I might just need a drink

[Hook]
I've been havin' so much on my mind lately I can't even think straight (I can't even think straight)

I see my baby boys, I know it may seem hard but I gotta make sure family straight

[Verse 2]
Daddy said sit back don't talk pay attention
Listen before talk don't talk before listen
Muhammad Ali I got balance, I'm gifted
Niggas play roles yeah they actin', it's scripted
I might pour up some more Act in my kidneys
Might hit my ex 'cause my main hoe is trippin'
Shoot at yo' hat 'cause my Kangol is pimpin'
Shot at yo' leg hit yo' ankle you limpin'
Pullin' back up with my nigga, my nigga
Pistol tucked down by my dick near my zipper
Alcohol bullets they eatin' yo' liver
Fuck my dick make her pull up make her deliver
I done worked too hard to go back to where I came from
They say I changed but I feel like I'm still the same Quan
Control these niggas' power buttons they cut the game on
Block all these haters and put them Tom Ford shades on

[Hook]
I've been havin' so much on my mind lately I can't even think straight (I can't even think straight)
Grip that muthafuckin' pistol so tight like a muthafuckin' firm handshake (like a handshake)

I see my baby boys, I know it may seem hard but I gotta make sure family straight

[Outro]
You gotta make sure family straight
If ain't nobody straight, after that make sure yo' dog straight
You know what I'm sayin'?
Keep them mice far away from you
Cause rats are not good
You know cats eat those, and I'ma big dog
Rich Homie!
