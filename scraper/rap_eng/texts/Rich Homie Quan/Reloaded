[Verse 1]
This for the people that said I wouldn't be shit
Look at me now mother fucker i'm rich
Then a mother fucker you can smell this lick
Gucci ear mug can't tell me shit
Gucci leather gloves i'm feeling myself
Gucci penny leather shoes every time I step
Gucci on my right foot and on the left
I'm gone keep gucci like the Plaza at Phipps
Use to hide money in a brown gucci box
Still throwing money in the brown gucci box
Spent 95 hundred on a lil Gucci watch
Only two people got em' just me and Stuey Rock
Bout seven months ago I was up an got broke
Lost a couple partners but I never lost hope
Came up on some dollars if it wasn't for like a pro
Hop would've been gone or in jail or dead
Instead I'm on the microphone fucking with my Nike's on
Running in the pussy she can't leave the dike alone
Coming for the cookie we be getting the Michael on
But she on thriller no matter if i'm right or wrong
She gone fuck with me no matter how far I go
She gone come get dick baby let's start over
We can be friends baby I am your card holder throw in your hand


[Hook]
The opposite of serious playing
Riding with a check heard I go in every song
And I ain't done yet Cus i'm still going in
Everybody say i'm next my time is now
And if the time counts down (5,4,3,2,1)
And if you ever get lonely you can call Rich Homie Baby


[Verse 2]
Whole lot of money baby whole lot of problems
Worth a whole lot of guns got a whole lot of cartridge
Got a whole lot of gator got a whole lot of ostrich
Worth a whole lot of money I got more in my pocket
Talking Ben Frank who are you to stop me an who am I to blame
I'm gone let her on top she gone try to say my name
I'm gone hit her from the back Damon Wayan Major Payne
Might bang bang bang just like pop
This chinchilla have my laying on a fox
Haters on the side line praying for me to fall
Intercept it like primetime i'm gone take the ball
Rich Homie coming up these niggas looking sour
These niggas switch up these niggas just chopping
These niggas at the base line hollering for a foul
I can tell shawty take her time when she take mine
And i'm talking bout head at the foot of the bed
Hope you came prepared don't be scared I ain't playing
We can take it there or flex up a spread
