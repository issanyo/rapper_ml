[Hook]
It seem like ain't nothing change because everybody changed on me
And I ain't did nothing to them but try to make a name for myself
I'm like fuck all the fame I don't care if I can't remain the person I am
Rich homie came and fucked up got them niggas like
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

[Verse]
Take a minute rest in peace to all my fallen soldiers
I ain't tryna fuck with shawty she gone tell her friends all our business
Pockets on yellow pages but she know a nigga number ain't listed
And she don't wanna fuck with me cause she convinced I got too many bitches
But love ain't posed to feel this way tell me what it is girl
I can't help the way I feel no I just might kill myself
And now I'm going broke, and you the reason because
I gave my all to you, and you made me fall for you
Nothing I say is false I stay true
I swear I won't break it I done sweared so many times so I had to make you a promise
I will stop cheating, I broke that same promise in 4 weeks
I wanted to go she did not want me to leave
I heard her talking and screaming all she got to saying was
No no no no no
No no no no no
Baby I'm sorry don't go
Baby I'm sorry don't go
She said no no no no no no no no no no
Baby I'm sorry don't go
Baby I'm sorry don't go
