[intro]
Let me take control of you, let me take control
Ain't no telling what we gone do, yo body babe
Me and you up in this room, all up in this room
Oh, Oh, Oh

[verse 1:  Tony Michael]
Girl we ain't no love making no, no, no (oh no oh no)
They just want the sex on the go, go, go (on the go, no no no no no)
They just hopping states going on that road
Hopping on the pole all night they go (all night they gone)
M-m-man these strippers they be making money (x3)
They making money
Unless you throwing cash then they ain't shaking no ass

[Chorus]
Dancing on that stage and it's all for me
In that lingerie that you wore for me
Girl I love the way that you move on me
Meet me in the back by the VIP
This money girl I'm gone throw it (in my private room)
The blunt rolled up we gone smoke it (in my private room)
Girl I love the way you do it (in my private room)
The way your body moving (in my private room oh)

[verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Boosie Badazz
Lets go up in my private room with Boos so we can thug it
Feed you stacks of dollar bills I'm so forreal
Plus, you can touch it
You wan' talk? We can discuss it
Roll that loud up, pass it, puff it
Besides them sexy tattoos on yo body she wear nothing
Super fire like Mellieha, lingerie my favorite color
I'm always looking out for shawty I'm her favorite hustler
In my private room I go live for you and it's all for me
Eye contact make me throw stacks
Plus, she crawl to me
Boosie Bad

[Chorus]
Dancing on that stage and it's all for me
In that lingerie that you wore for me
Girl I love the way that you move on me
Meet me in the back by the VIP
This money girl I'm gone throw it (in my private room)
The blunt rolled up we gone smoke it (in my private room)
Girl I love the way you do it (in my private room)
The way your body moving (in my private room oh)

[verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
Private room dancing baby

[Chorus]
Dancing on that stage and it's all for me
In that lingerie that you wore for me

Meet me in the back by the VIP
This money girl I'm gone throw it (in my private room)
The blunt rolled up we gone smoke it (in my private room)
Girl I love the way you do it (in my private room)
The way your body moving (in my private room oh)
