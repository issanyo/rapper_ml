(Intro)
Thats Right 2
Aye
Keep me from around that bullshit
Them lame hoes
And them hating niggas
Aye

(Hook)
Can't show a lame nigga too much
So I don't bring em round
Them same niggas who was up
Funny they need me now
Can't learn the game outta no book
So let me teach you how
Too get rich and not make a sound
Keep me from round
Them low digits
Keep me from round
Broke bitches
Keep Me From Round
Hoe Niggas
Keep me from round
Yo sister
Keep me from round
Niggas still baggin sacks
You need at least a pound
Like a bitch who got that package
Keep me from round

(Verse 1)
Say you wanna squash that beef
Ok cool then
Well I'm thinking about eating that beef
Give me a spoon then
I'm a need some with alot of speed
Sumn I can zoom
That pussy so good to me
I might let her move in
Lift the whole 50 on my roof
So they notice me
My foreign hoe pronounce
My shoe "Lois v"
Money surround me so a broke nigga can't get close to me
My bitch bad like yo hoe suppose to be
My wrist cold more like 4 degree
Don't get me pissed off real niggas on go for me
Got a bitch that bust them blunts
And 1 to roll the weed
I say rich homie baby
So you knowâ€‹ it's me

(Hook)
Can't show a lame nigga too much
So I don't bring em round
Them same niggas who was up
Funny they need me now
Can't learn this game outta no book
So let me teach you how
Too get rich and not make a sound
Keep me from round
Them low digits
Keep me from round
Broke bitches
Keep Me From Round
Hoe Niggas
Keep me from round
Yo sister
Keep me from round
Niggas still baggin sacks
You need at least a pound
Like a bitch who got that pack
Keep me from round

(Verse 2)
I Throw The K Like A Pitcher
Show Me The Mound
Why You Don't Like Them Niggas?
No Reason Found
Measurement For My Head
Bitch, I Need A Crown
With Two Loaves Of Bread
I Can Feed The Town
Keep Me From Round
Like I Got A Cold
Money Come & Go
Have Em Runnin, Like A Snotty Nose
I Gotta Go, Stack Some Extra Funds
Lookin For My Pot Of Gold, I'm Sumn Like A Leprechaun
And This Ever Run
I Been Gettin It Gone, And I Been Gettin It
My Plug A Mexican
Stop That Flexxiconn, Boy Yu Kiddin
And Ima Stack It To The Ceilin
My Delivery Worth A Milli
And I'm Spittin, I Got More Bars Than The Penitentiary

(Hook)
Can't show a lame nigga too much
So I don't bring em round
Them same niggas who was up
Funny they need me now
Can't learn this game outta no book
So let me teach you how
Too get rich and not make a sound
Keep me from round
Them low digits
Keep me from round
Broke bitches
Keep Me From Round
Hoe Niggas
Keep me from round
Yo sister
Keep me from round
Niggas still baggin sacks
You need at least a pound
Like a bitch who got that pack
Keep me from round
