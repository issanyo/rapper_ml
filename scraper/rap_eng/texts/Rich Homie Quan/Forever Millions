[Hook:]
On mondays I'm at Magic like David Copperfield
I keep my business on shh, ask 'em how that choppa feel
You thought I was broke, pshh I got more than millions
Penthouse suite top from on the building
Thanksgiving swag, but I feel like a pilgrim
Had to change location, heard a nigga wanna kill me
I don't care if you kill me, just don't touch none of my children
With no hands, you gotta feel me

[Verse 1:]
I came in and I got less sun, and I'm glad that I voted
I bought me some new animals, I got tired of sleeping with roaches
I walk around with this on my hip, nigga I don't need no holster
40 on my shit, look nigga I don't walk around with no holster
I say doom got that stick on me, we ride around and they ghost
Ride around and we toast, ride around and we loaded
Don’t ride around with broke bitches, they’ll get you off your motive Sunday be boring if I ain’t got no show boy, you know I—

[Verse 2:]
Shawty don't want wanna pull up her shirt, cuz she timid
I told her down my pants and say hello to willy
Put my dick off in her face she eat it like at Beni's
Stand up on her chedda, I can see you like a midget
Tom Ford got me ballin', I'm not walkin' on my pivot
I don't like New England, but I love 'em Boston bitches
If you owe me money, boy, my [?] will come and get it
Call me me YT Quan  I done gained a new position
Plus shawty ain't got teeth, I gotta spoon feed her
I was failin' until I fucked one of my school teachers
I wasn't feelin' detention, so I skipped school, people
Yeah, I skipped school, nigga
I never thought I would make it this far
I had to open my eyes and relax
And God gave me a gift and that's my voice, and I'mma run wit it
