[Hook]
I'mma keep that nigga up off you
Relieve that stress up off you
Take that cheap shit off you
Put on this dress I bought you
Keep them problems up off you
Take my debit card to keep dem loose dollars up off you
Get a bodyguard to keep broke niggas up off you
Them dope dealers up off you
Trying to keep my hands up off you
Tryna get the pants up off you
Let me ease ya mind up off you
You can't keep Rich Homie up off you

[Verse 1]
Keep them problems up off you
Keep that stress up off you
Keep them broke niggas off you
Tryna get some neck up out you
Keep them free loaders off you
Keep them broke bitches off you
Keep them Joe Janes off you
And keep them ho niggas off you
And they only wanna be in your business
They don't really care about you, only wanna know if we did it
But you know I care about you, baby, you know I'm serious
This pistol keep that nigga up off you, you feel me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Keep that paper work on you
Keep them pennies up off you
Take that cheap shit off you
Put on this Fendi I bought you
Take that lace front off you
You look better natural
Take that makeup off you
All that face stuff off you
Keep them women away from you
Keep them niggas up off you
Keep the lies away from you
Keep them issues up off you
Keep that grey hair off you
Keep that skress away from you
Better let him know that I will not play bout you
