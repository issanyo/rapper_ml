We Finally Made It
Told my momma we ain't gotta stretch nomoe
Nomoe unemployed checks nomoe
I swear imma get her that big hz with that flexin gate
Nomoe section 8
Cause We Finally Made It
We made it [2x]
I know Teezy would of been proud of me
That's why he still living inside of me
I say we made it
We had to brand ourselves
Cuz we ain't basic
In my pocket there's a phonebook
Alotta pages
Got cho address so don't play me
I'll have yo momma tryna even out yo cases
I'm playing wide both legs
Fuck with her she bow leg
Feelin on her booty
Like damn that's fake them booty shots
He cuffin bitches po legs
I been rolling for life for days
She wanna suck my dick go head
I been to hell and back no set
I remember making a palace in the weirdest places
Fuck nigga put us out
Momma always told me remember faces
And I can't spit soft
I gotta go the hardest
I tell em trade up bitch

[Hook]
I need to see a doctor cause I'm sick been spittin
Plus I got alotta partners in the pin and they did
Cause I'm viscous and I'm like a snake
I wrap around then and spit venom
And I killem
And I stay down with my hustle
Yuin know my struggle
My momma worked a double
Juss so I can have double
I couldn't take a loss
I had to make my money back
Told my momma she could dye all her gray hair
Cuz they ain't comin back
Now I'm on top
And these niggas want to hate
They see I came from the block
And say he down the same way
And I got banked up by the cops
But got out the same day
And I pat myself on my back
Cause nigga...
