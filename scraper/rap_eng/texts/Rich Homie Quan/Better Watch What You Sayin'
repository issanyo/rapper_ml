Please don't you say it, all I know is get money
Y'all niggas be playing and y'all niggas don't want it
Better watch what you saying 'cause my niggas, they on it
And my niggas don't play fair, just give it to you if you want it
My niggas don't play fair but they'll give it to you if you want it
Better watch what you saying
Better watch what you saying
Better watch what you saying
Better watch what you saying

Better watch what you saying 'cause I don't play like that
Hundred thousand in my pants, nigga straight like that
I could lose a twenty in a day, I bet I'll make it right back
I don't write shit down, I punch it in, so pay it right back
Rich homie, baby, I make her say it like that
Gotta write the whole in that K, you know it's straight like that
And I take that back, that F and a gold getter
Got a shooter on the building, bullets gonna hit you
And they gonna split you, break it up and separate you
Keep 'em out your business, haters, they investigate you
And I ain't tryina place you at the top
With the same niggas I came with from the block

Please don't you say it, all I know is get money
Y'all niggas be playing and y'all niggas don't want it
Better watch what you saying 'cause my niggas, they on it
And my niggas don't play fair, just give it to you if you want it
My niggas don't play fair but they'll give it to you if you want it
Better watch what you saying
Better watch what you saying
Better watch what you saying
Better watch what you saying

I need another gun 'cause I just caught the plate
I put your eyes where your mouth is, now watch what you say
I got them Dope Boy Nikes on like Dr. Dre
And you broke hoes three words, out my face
And I flipped like three birds yesterday
I don't know what he heard, but that's not accurate
I mean accurate, oups, my mistake
I just got a new watch and I still find myself in last
You niggas sweet and I smell the flowers
You keep brown in your weed, call you Eddie Bauer
And you mess with kids like a pedophile
Got something for you to suck on, no pacifier

Please don't you say it, all I know is get money
Y'all niggas be playing and y'all niggas don't want it
Better watch what you saying 'cause my niggas, they on it
And my niggas don't play fair, just give it to you if you want it
My niggas don't play fair but they'll give it to you if you want it
Better watch what you saying
Better watch what you saying
Better watch what you saying
Better watch what you saying
