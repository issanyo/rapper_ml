[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Send it to my phone, send it to my phone
You already know I keep it on the low
Baby, you can trust me, promise I'm alone
I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone
Send it to my phone, send it to my phone
You already know I keep it on the low
Baby, you can trust me, promise I'm alone
I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone

[Verse 1: Austin Mahone]
You took it in the mirror, so I could see it clear
Baby have no fear, you know it's stayin' here
I know you wanna share, baby might as well
You know I keep it trill, you know I'd never tell
I'm sure you took a few, slide me one or two
I know when that hotline bling, that can only mean one thing
You know what I like, I've been waitin' on
What's takin' so long? Send it to my phone

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Send it to my phone, send it to my phone
You already know I keep it on the low
Baby, you can trust me, promise I'm alone
I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone
Send it to my phone, send it to my phone
You already know I keep it on the low
Baby, you can trust me, promise I'm alone
I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Okay now send it to my phone like a message that's unread
Send it to my phone, new nude picture, open leg
Hope they ready
Austin Mahone got 'em motivated
Send it to my phone like a notification
Send it to my phone, but my ringer cut off
I can't leave you alone, even though I'm single and I'm
Send it to my phone like a message from my BM
Notify me on my phone like a message in my DM
Send it

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Send it to my phone, send it to my phone
You already know I keep it on the low
Baby, you can trust me, promise I'm alone
I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone
Send it to my phone, send it to my phone
You already know I keep it on the low
Baby, you can trust me, promise I'm alone
I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone

[Bridge: Austin Mahone]
Baby what's the move? Don't need no attitude
You know it'll stay just between me and you
I wanna see already, it's the perfect view
Tell me if you're leavin', can I have it too?
Tell you that I love you, yeah, ain't none above you, yeah
I wanna see you, babe
I promise, baby girl, it'll be our little secret, yeah
I'm gonna keep it, yeah
Let no one see it, except for me

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Send it to my phone, send it to my phone
You already know I keep it on the low
Baby, you can trust me, promise I'm alone
I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone
Send it to my phone, send it to my phone
You already know I keep it on the low
Baby, you can trust me, promise I'm alone
I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone
Send it to my phone
