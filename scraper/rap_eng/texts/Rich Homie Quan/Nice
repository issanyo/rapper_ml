[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan & Premadonna]
Nice lil ass back there can't even fit in the jeans she got on
Pocket full of cash only, I want your money, I don't want Patr√≥n, duh
I'm tryna get you drunk lil thing, tryna get you in your zone
Boy I can buy my own drinks, matter fact pull a bitch up to the bank
You're looking really sexy over there, you know you want it nigga
I ain't gon' lie baby girl, come get it
I want to, I want to, am I scarin' you?
I ain't scared of shit, rock with it
Rock rock rock rock, get it
Rock rock rock rock, get it
Rock rock rock rock, get it
Rock rock rock rock, get it

[Verse 1: Premadonna & Trick Daddy]
What you pullin' out your cash for? ('cause it's mine)
What you lookin' at my ass for? (you done got fine)
I came to give them niggas what they want but I'm natural
Nothing like your last ho
I'm the type that'll sit on your face
Spit on your dick then hit on your bitch
I ain't never been a jealous ho
I'm trisexual, we can share that ho (ooh-wee)
My pussy got expensive taste
Thirty-six C cups, but what's to waste?
Came up on some pimping shit
Then turned right around tryna wife a bitch (ha ha)
I got they ass like a pillow top
And this jiggalo jiggle like jello shots
I need a nigga with a big old cock
With that good old jugg so I can get on top

[Pre-Chorus: Rich Homie Quan & Premadonna]
Who the fuck said you was a hood girl
My game when I was married
I was just tryna buy you a drink
Might knock on my name girl l you said ask me
You know you the baddest, your attitude nasty
I apologize how I treat you, but my demeanor classy

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan & Premadonna]
You're looking really sexy over there, you know you want it nigga
I ain't gon' lie baby girl, come get it
I want to, I want to, am I scarin' you?
I ain't scared of shit, rock with it
Rock rock rock rock, get it
Rock rock rock rock, get it
Rock rock rock rock, get it
Rock rock rock rock, get it

[Bridge: Rich Homie Quan & Premadonna]
Rock with it, want you to rock with it
You ain't never had nothin' this gushy
Rock with it, want you to rock with it
You ain't never had nothin' this gushy (gushy)

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy & Premadonna]
I need a girl that's cornfed
Eat the rice and beans with her cornbread (that's me)
One that's clean, petite
So I can kiss her feet and make her bite the sheets (ow)
Step to her like what up boo?
How is you? is you okay?
I'm a nigga out the county Dade
From now on bitch, I'm your bae (okay)
Anybody with a problem with it
Got somethin' to say, tell 'em say it to me
And if I'm your bae, you my bitch
Who you know more player than me? (ha ha)
Thug nigga my pedigree
My tongue be the best kind of therapy (ow)
I'm a nigga that'll lick the twat and get you nice and hot
And then hit the spot (ow)

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan & Premadonna]
You're looking really sexy over there, you know you want it nigga
I ain't gon' lie baby girl, come get it
I want to, I want to, am I scarin' you?
I ain't scared of shit, rock with it
Rock rock rock rock, get it
Rock rock rock rock, get it
Rock rock rock rock, get it
Rock rock rock rock, get it

[Outro: Rich Homie Quan & Premadonna]
That's right too
Premadonna, what's up?
I think you got you one baby
I ain't gon' even lie
This right here
Is some of that Luke shake your booty shit
You know what I mean?
Nah, some of that, uh, Trick shit (ha ha)
I brought that Miami shit back
From the 404 to the 305 (305, 305)
Ha ha, Pre, Rich Homie Quan
