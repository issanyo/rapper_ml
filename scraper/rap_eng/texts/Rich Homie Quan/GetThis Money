[Bridge]
We be drinking till I'm faded, we living like we made it
And we be getting papers so we be collecting payments
Now we be in the nice whips with ladies right beside me
The bitches we be fucking what you be calling wify

[Hook]
'Cause we gonna get this money, 'cause we gonna get this money
'Cause we gonna get this money, 'cause we gonna get this money
'Cause we gonna get this money, 'cause we gonna get this money
'Cause we gonna get this money, 'cause we gonna get this money

[Verse 1]
Hold up, hold up, hold up
You can't get money unless I'm in it
Wait a minute, your money small, just like midgets
My money tall, I'm talking empire
Built in, I'm getting shit, I like that hoe on fire
You ain't getting nothing, I be teaching a seminar
Bitch, I been big, hell yeah, I'm a fucking star
These niggas watching me from the sidelines
These niggas seeing me, yeah, I'm getting mine
These hoe niggas on some old shit
These old niggas on some old shit
Niggas that fold kisses always fold kisses
Niggas that stake 'em always stack 'em
Niggas always say forgive, you know this, you know this
My niggas, they steady on the grind because we talk about money
Niggas always talk about money, my nigga, I'm getting mine
Try to stop everything a nigga gonna do
But when they bless a nigga like me they gonna say

[Bridge]
We be drinking till I'm faded, we living like we made it
And we be getting papers so we be collecting payments
Now we be in the nice whips with ladies right beside me
The bitches we be fucking what you be calling wify

[Hook]
'Cause we gonna get this money, 'cause we gonna get this money
'Cause we gonna get this money, 'cause we gonna get this money
'Cause we gonna get this money, 'cause we gonna get this money
'Cause we gonna get this money, 'cause we gonna get this money

[Verse 2]
Money, see, you know I get money
I grind seven days out of the week, rain, sleep or sunny
I wish you pussy niggas would try to take this shit from me
That's why you wearing Gucci but yet you looking buffy
The food you eat is crumby, your money tell me nothing
You say you hustle hard, that's why your ass, they send team
But you look like you're broke and your shit is a joke
You battle me on the west coast, nigga, bet your ass would choke
Your ass will get smoked, I want the chain like Nemo
I got your hoe on the news, she like, she like it deep throat
Oh shit, good thing I went in, oh, yeah, I'm gonna get it in
You niggas say that I write but I don't use no paper pen
I get it all down, these niggas look so lovely
These niggas looking at me like this nigga's so phony
But wait a minute, let a nigga speed it up
Got your bitch, I'mma eat it up, see that pussy, I'mma beat it up

[Bridge]
We be drinking till I'm faded, we living like we made it
And we be getting papers so we be collecting payments
Now we be in the nice whips with ladies right beside me
The bitches we be fucking what you be calling wify

[Hook]
'Cause we gonna get this money, 'cause we gonna get this money
'Cause we gonna get this money, 'cause we gonna get this money
'Cause we gonna get this money, 'cause we gonna get this money
'Cause we gonna get this money, 'cause we gonna get this money
