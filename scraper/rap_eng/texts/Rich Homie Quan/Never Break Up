[Intro: Slim]
Break up, we ain't never gon break up (x4)

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
We ain't never gon break up, I solemnly swear
If we break up promise we gon make up
I promise to keep it 100 and never do no favors
I promise to never leave you cause I know I can't replace you
Hold up wait Slim sing it for me hey

[Verse 2: Slim]
I know the sun is going to shine anytime I'm with you
I know the clouds might get dark but my heart know we'll get through (know we'll get through)
Cause I'm with you (cause I'm with you)
We kiss and we make up that's how we do (that's how we do)

[Pre-Chorus: Slim]
Yeah we never gonna (break up)
Just so we can make up (we can make up)
Now I'm messing all your makeup (all your makeup)

That's the only way we never break up
Yeah we never gonna (break up)

[Verse 3: Slim]
I know sometimes you feel in your mind the things that you find don't always seem true
You know I'm down right from the start when it gets hard you know I'll come through (you know I'll come through)

[Verse 4: Rich Holmie Quan]
I put that on everything we ain't breaking up baby
I put that on everything you ain't going nowhere baby
Money got me up to the point that I'm aggravated
We broke up for no reason add it up then you calculate
Got a master dick cause she say she miss me so much
No mistletoe but they all want to kiss me so much
Black power one finger up don't give a fuck
I know that you want to leave me but I ain't giving up

[Chorus: Slim]
Yeah we never gonna (we ain't never gon break up)
Break up, we ain't never gon break up
Cause you're the only one I want (we ain't never gon break up)
Break up, we ain't never gon break up
Yeah we never gonna (we ain't never gon break up)
Yeah we never gonna (we ain't never gon break up)
Break up, we ain't never gon break up
Cause you're the only one I want (we ain't never gon break up)
Break up, we ain't never gon break up
Yeah we never gonna
