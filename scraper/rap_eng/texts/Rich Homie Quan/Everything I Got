Got the bitch all new New Yorkers, so I flew her to New York

What did I do to you to make you feel like this?
Percocet, might pop a pill, like we
Like i can't feel my soul, and I can't feel my finger
Tell why you talk, them broke bitches I been with
They don't come at your feelin's
They don't know shit that we go through
They don't even care, cause they not there for you
They just want your money, baby, get that through your skull
They gon' strip you for everything you got, you gon' swear that they were no
It won't give you no hassle, bae
If you're feelin' yourself too much take that shit back like David Hassleoff bae
Grayhound ain't gon' stress you baby
House so big, no neighbors near me
And I an't high, beleive me for that
Baby girl just try me
Love me for everything I got
Everything I got (hold on)
Everything I got, everything, everything I got
Everything I got, everything, everything I got
Everything I got, everything, everything I got
Everything I got, everything, everything I got
I got it on my own
Everything I got, I would say everything I got
Everything I got, I would say everything I got
I'd give in my peace from God for everything I got
Everything, everything I got
Everything, everything I got
Everything, everything I got
Everything, everything I got
Everything, everything I got
Everything, everything I got
Everything, everything I got
Everything, everything I got

I'mma need mo' problem, more proble, mo' money
When I was broke ain't have no problem
Cause these folks wasn't stuntin'
I could'nt get nun from nobody
Cause no one would trust me

Ain't nobody bluff me
