[Hook: Kiana]
Walked in, thirty thousand in your pocket
Had them other bitches like, "Ooh, ooh, ooh"
50,000 dollars on your trick, wanna fuck you
Got her screamin' like, "Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
But I got a check, I ain't gotta flex
Baby, I'm the best, 'cause I got it, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't need no x, keep a girl impressed
Put a little x got me screamin' like "Ooh, ooh, ooh"

[Verse 1: Kiana]
Your chick, what her name is?
You think your green ain't the only one she came with
You wanna fuck and she down too
Broke bitch, but she be rich after round two
Whole lotta noise, what you saying?
Boy, understand that the talk is no play
I'll tell you what really sounds good to me
Give that 30,000 out there for free

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan & Both]
(How much you made?) Made two million dollars off a mixtape
And I'm fucking like, ooh, ooh, ooh
They try to drop me with a case but you know I had done skated
I was singing like, ooh, ooh, ohh
Boy, I know my role and I play it
If you heard that I'm talking, then I said it
(Quan where you at?) At the top of the loft nigga, I stay
I'm a bad boy but I don't wear big clothes like Ma$e
In the club and a nigga get it boppin'
And that ho, she want a free drink, tell the bitch to get up off me
I'm the nigga to get it poppin', her hair short like Dennis Rodman
At the Clearport nigga, we flying, when I landed, boy I
