[Intro]
I done got to the point where, I really consider myself goin up ya nahmsayin
30 you a fool for this one
I fuck wit you, you fuck wit me, let’s fuck wit we
I’m on a whole nother vibe right now shawty
Ya nahmsayin, you gotta feel where I’m comin from ha ha
Aye rich homie

[Chorus]
Swallow my pride, I realized that it won't hurt to call her
I watch her blossom from a seed to a perfect flower
Gave me her heart and yeah she trust me, I can’t hurt lil’ shawty
I’m her employee of the month because I work the hardest
I like the way she wear her hair, I like her crazy style
I do her like a math equation when I break her down
I ain’t tell none of her secrets that she done told me 'bout
At first I was scared to reveal it, I wanna show her now

[Verse 1]
Presidential I feel like Obama, girl you look so good I thank yo momma (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You were there for me when I ain’t had nothin’ (you were there for me)
Them other bitches they just want my money (fuck them hoes)
I threw you on the gram bae, that when we went public yeah
Money talk like Charlie Sheen, Chris Tucker discussion yeah
When you first start talkin’ to me, you was on that fuck shit yeah
When I first told you I loved you, you ain’t really love me
First day I met you I tried to fuck, now that’s a introduction (rich homie baby)
Sacrifice my feelings and my emotions and all my time (that right too)
You one of one baby, they don't make no more your kind (you one of one baby)
Can’t get in my phone, I changed the code, you know I’m lyin’
And it’s hard for me to put it to the side

[Chorus]
Swallow my pride, I realized that it won't hurt to call her (hurt to call her)
I watch her blossom from a seed to a perfect flower (perfect flower)
Gave me her heart and yeah she trust me, I can’t hurt lil’ shawty (hurt lil' shawty)
I’m her employee of the month because I work the hardest
I like the way she wear her hair, I like her crazy style
I do her like a math equation when I break her down (break her down)
I ain’t tell none of her secrets that she done told me bout
At first I was scared to reveal it, I wanna show her now

[Verse 2]
I wanna take you out, show you off, might take her home to my people
Might pop the question, might take a walk, might put a ring on your finger
I fell in love wit the way you wear your hair, I fell in love wit yo demeanor
And I could never take your love for granted, and I couldn’t never front like Ion't need ya
I can’t just tell you how I feel, I wanna show the world
You were nobody when we start talkin’, I didn’t know ya girl
You get emotional and vulnerable when you open up
Wanna be like Jay and Beyonce but we not close enough
Can't get you off my mind (I been thinkin' bout you shawty)
Say you took me back time again after time (despite what we been through)
Say you took me back after all of my lying (I love you shawty)
To be real bae I don’t know how we survived
But we did bae thank God you stayed down

[Chorus]
Swallow my pride, I realized that it won't hurt to call her (hurt to call)
I watch her blossom from a seed to a perfect flower (perfect flower)
Gave me her heart and yeah she trust me, I can’t hurt lil’ shawty (can't hurt lil' shawty)
I’m her employee of the month because I work the hardest (I work the hardest)
I like the way she wear her hair, I like her crazy style (I love it)
I do her like a math equation when I break her down (break her down)
I ain’t tell none of her secrets that she done told me bout
At first I was scared to reveal it, I wanna show her now
