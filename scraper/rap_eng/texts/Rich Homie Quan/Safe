Yeah, get the money everyday and throw that bread in the safe yeah
And if you come up short put yo' head on the plate yeah
Had to grind and grind and go get it
Had to stay away from hoe niggas
More problems then it's more hittas
Yeah, get the money everyday and throw that bread in the safe yeah
And if you come up short put yo' head on the plate yeah
Had to grind and grind and go get it
Had to stay away from hoe niggas
More problems then it's more hittas

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
A lot of rubber bands in the safe boy
I don't buy nothin' I'm dirt cheap
Red carpet fresh yeah all the time
Brown suit call a nigga Louis 13
No feelings can't let a bitch hurt me
Broke bitches are the only thing that hurt me
Get money lil' shit we don't trip 'bout
Talk cash money shit I got a big mouth
Stop savin' these hoes with a cape on
The stick got a snare and a bass drum
The TEC got my name on it Draymond
Money in the mattress every night 'cause I lay on it
Ballin' hard need a new court to play on
I can't fall off I'ma stay on
Big crib no more Section 8 homes
So many diamonds in the Patek, look like the fake gone
Paid yo' son to ask the people
Suck it like a vacuum cleaner
Strong dope pass the needle
Who gon' smoke pass the reefer
200 of 'em in the back of the Regal
And I need a lawyer I'm talkin' a paralegal
I just get the money I can't get mad at people
Tryin' to get the brand new bag everyday
Rich Homie!

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
Yeah, get the money everyday and throw that bread in the safe yeah

And if you come up short put yo' head on the plate yeah

[Verse 2: Cyko]
Get the money everyday, throw the bread in the safe
Nigga get wrong, throw the lead in his face
Had to go get the money go get the money go, you slow nigga I don't know nigga why you broke
Traphouse go crazy, gotta grind like a broke lady
I was there bro had to get on
Couple niggas hatin' had to get gone
I've been goin' hard man I can't stop
Old money new money in the shoe box
And I'm still with the same old day ones
Same nigga never changed with the fame on
Had to go get a chain with my name on it
Wrist game came with the rain on it
Neck so wet like it paint on it
Real trap nigga got the thing on me
Had to really be a man, had stand on my two feet
You don't understand why I ride with the 2 heat
Money comin' in they gon' hate on it
They don't wanna see me win better pray on it
They don't wanna see me win better pray on it
I'ma go and get the bag keep the weight on it
And if it come up short put yo' head on the plate
I need everything put the bag on my main yeah

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
Yeah, get the money everyday and throw that bread in the safe yeah
