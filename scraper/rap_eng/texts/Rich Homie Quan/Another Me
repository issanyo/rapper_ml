[Hook]
It can't be no other me, establish?
It can't be no another me
It can't be no another me
I smoke good and nigga pound good
Can't help how I sound but it can't be no another me
I'm the future, stop comparing us
It can't be no another me
There won't be another me
Ok now he and me, not equal
I got to show all these people
For the reason
There won't ever be another me

[Verse 1]
Gotta know these faces who you gonna get for graduation
Want you to know I'm in, want you to know I'm serious
Want you to know I'm killing...
If you want it you can get it
I ain't in my feeling but I want you to feel this
I ain't tryin to be the realest but the shit I talk about I really live this
To the critics try to stack it to the ceiling
These are real niggas on some millions
Girl it can't be no other me
I ain't lying but on my time boy don't fuck with me
Got no...I got no pain, for how them thoughts come out of me
And if fuck what you thought around me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I know all my exes still in love with me
I told my baby mama there will never be another me
I know they love to see me down babe
I'm laughing at these niggas clowning
You know we reef forever, my crewed got reef forever
Invite my bitches over and have a get together
Don't need no shrink but I gotta get my shit together
Bitch on my...we're not here together
It can't be no another me
My heart blocked and my heart locked
Can't use no other king
I ain't gotta tell you where to go cause you know where to be
She phone me and said

[Hook]
It can't be no another me
I smoke good and nigga pound good
Can't help how I sound but it can't be no another me
I'm the future, stop comparing us
It can't be no another me
There won't be another me
Ok now hear me, not equal
I gash all these people
For the reason
There won't ever be another me
