[Intro: Kayla Brianna & Bre-auty]
Ever since you went away, I been up late
In the room with the light off, trying to escape
My feelings, boy this feeling
Used to be everything I looked forward to
Nowadays I don’t feel like I know you
But tell me if I’m wrong, if so I’ll leave you alone
All I wanna know is

[Pre-Chorus: Bre-auty]
Do you remember when you said
You’ll never leave me, baby
Do you remember what you said
It’ll always be you and me

[Chorus: Kayla Brianna]
Where are you now?
Cause I’m right here, boy
Ain't goin' nowhere, boy
Where are you now?
But I wish I knew then what I know now

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Remember them times you weren’t there for a young nigga, tell me (do you, do you?)
Do you remember the times I was locked up, you was out cheating, girl? (do you, do you?)
I don’t think you realize the shit I be goin’ through, girl, do you, do you?
But since you don’t give a fuck, here’s my middle finger, screw you, screw you
I tried to give you my all but you ain't want me cause that sound too much like Ray
And you seen me ball just like Spaulding, probably thought I was gon' make you my wife
Every night bitches all on me, this lifestyle cost no price
This watch right here got ice
100, Ben Franklin, do no lesser faces
Everything I bought, you can keep that even though we’re separated
Killin’ me with these text messages girl, they seem pre-meditated
Lookin' for a little relationship girl, please don’t anticipate it
Cause I ain’t comin’ back, baby sing it to ’em like

[Chorus: Kayla Brianna]
Where are you now?
Cause I’m right here, boy
Ain't goin' nowhere, boy
Where are you now?
But I wish I knew then what I know now

[Verse 2: Kayla Brianna]
I wish I knew who you really were
Still looking for some answers
For how you treated me baby
How could you treat me this way?

[Bridge: Bre-auty]
Where were you baby? (where were you?)
Where were you? (where were you?)
Where are you baby? (where are you?)
Where are you? (where were you?)
Where were you baby? (where were you?)
Where were you? (where were you?)
Where are you baby? (where are you?)
Where are you? (where were you?)

[Pre-Chorus: Bre-auty]
Do you remember when you said
You’ll never leave me, baby
Do you remember what you said
It’ll always be you and me

[Chorus: Kayla Brianna]
Where are you now?
Cause I’m right here, boy
Ain't goin' nowhere, boy
Where are you now?
But I wish I knew then what I know now

[Outro: Rich Homie Quan]
Do you, do you
Do you, do you
Do you, do you
