[Intro]
If you ever thought I was going broke
You thought wrong, my nigga
If you ever think I was falling off
Fuck you then

[Chorus]
Don't let that money fool ya, boy, ain't shit changed
We in Miami on Biscayne
Forty-thousand for the big face
And they want another fifty-thousand just to bust it down
I've been doing this shit since sixth grade
Teachers told me I would never make
No money off these words, now I'm not worried 'bout nobody
Told that same teacher, "Look at me" and I didn't go to college

[Verse 1]
We 'bout to party just like Rick James
Old Nat, I'm up by Biscayne
Albert Einstein, I'm insane
But I'm a fool with them numbers on the corner with some lumber
In the trap, got off a whole thang
I flushed it all when them folks came
Aye, I might sacrifice a two just, so I can make ten
Got it out the street, made my name in the pavement
I wasn't in the club, put it up, I was savin'
Yeah, I love my plug, he show love, he not racist
Came home, saw a million, then I made some
Never switch shit up, I'm the same Quan

[Chorus]
Don't let that money fool ya, boy, ain't shit changed
We in Miami on Biscayne
Forty-thousand for the big face
And they want another fifty-thousand just to bust it down
I've been doing this shit since sixth grade
Teachers told me I would never make
No money off these words, now I'm not worried 'bout nobody
Told that same teacher, "Look at me" and I didn't go to college

[Verse 2]
My only friend is a Ben Frank
I wanted money just like Kinte
Hustling hard to keep the rent paid
Told mama close the door, 'cause I'm jumpin' off the porch
My only mission is to get paid
Lock that money in a big safe
Ain't no tint up on the cars, so I know they know it's me
I ain't never had shit, I wear my watch when I go to sleep
I put a lil' money in my smile, that the reason I show my teeth
And I can afford to pay a nigga a couple a thousand a month just to roll up my weed
I got my money, moved out the hood, can you blame me, nigga?
Money made, but I'm the same me, nigga

[Chorus]
Don't let that money fool ya, boy, ain't shit changed
We in Miami on Biscayne
Forty-thousand for the big face
And they want another fifty-thousand just to bust it down
I've been doing this shit since sixth grade
Teachers told me I would never make
No money off these words, now I'm not worried 'bout nobody
Told that same teacher, "Look at me" and I didn't go to college
