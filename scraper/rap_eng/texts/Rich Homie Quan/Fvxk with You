[Intro: Angel & Rich Homie Quan]
I do, I do, oh baby
Rich Homie baby

[Hook: Angel]
I really wanna fuck with you
She said you know I want it bad as you
You know what keeps me coming back to you
That's why you make love to me like you do

[Verse 1: Angel]
I was meant to call ya
Then I got stressing, bought a quarter
And I don't usually drink baby
But lately I've been sipping on corona
Took a little break, you was never over
I've been over seas, tryna get this paper
Since you been away, shit ain't been the same
I just wanna say, sorry if I let you walk away

[Pre-Hook]
(Did I let you?)
(Did I let you?)
Sorry if I let you walk away
(If I let you)
(If I let you)
Sorry if I let you walk away

[Hook: Angel]
I really wanna fuck with you
She said you know I want it bad as you
You know what keeps me coming back to you
That's why you make love to me like you do

[Post-Hook: Angel]
All I wanna do, is fuck with you
All I wanna do, I want it bad as you do

[Verse 2: Angel]
I know I should've called ya, but I was busy hanging on the corner
You know I usually take care babe
But for some reason I've been feeling like a loner
Took a little break, now I'm playing poker
You should let me in, I just wanna hold ya
If it's just a fling, you don't need a ring, we can do our thing
Baby, I don't wanna walk away

[Pre-Hook]
(Did I let you?)
(Did I let you?)
Sorry if I let you walk away
(If I let you)
(If I let you)
Sorry if I let you walk away
(Did I let you?)
(Did I let you?)
Sorry if I let you walk away
(If I let you)
(If I let you)
Oh yeah yeah

[Hook: Angel & Rich Homie Quan]
I really wanna fuck with you
She said you know I want it bad as you
You know what keeps me coming back to you
You know what keep me coming back
That's why you make love to me like you do
Rich Homie, baby

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
I fuck with you although you don't even know it
My feelings kinda blind girl, cause I don't never show 'em
It's me and you tonight, tell the boys I ain't going
My car and you got somethin' in common, you both half foreign
I know you fuck with me 'cause you tatt it on your arm
Here you count the money baby, I got a sore thumbs
Hit her from the back boy I think tore something
Shawty lil tough, lil steak, sirloin
Three strikes ya out, after that you're gone
Shawty fell in love for a night, can't blame her
I had to go to the U.K. to fuck with Angel
Hit her from the back, make her scream then spank her
Girl you fuck with me, I fuck with you, I like to thank you

[Hook: Angel] (2x)
I really wanna fuck with you
She said you know I want it bad as you
You know what keeps me coming back to you
That's why you make love to me like you do

[Outro]
All I wanna do, is fuck with you
All I wanna do, I want it bad as you do
