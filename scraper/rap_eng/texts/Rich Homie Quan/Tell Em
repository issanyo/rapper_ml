Imma pull up on her, eat on that pussy and dip
Imma keep one inside the table like whip
Dang the girl small, Like she smaller than milk
Have her on my side like a fucking hip
She goin make sure I survive, She goin do it well
Baby I just want them thighs, right under that belt
She just want me to keep them lies all to myself
She goin help me like she sell them L's

She goin look up on these bitches like terms and conditions
Imma move her out the trenches and buy her a business
Imma fuck her then hold on to her like she went missing
Imma pull on that weave and hair cause its any ribbon
I got the key, She wanna ride with me
She tie the knot so she can die with me
She say she can do the same thing as five bitches
So I went and fired them five bitches
She the, B-E-S-T, Beeesst
She ride me, She riding on that pussy like a T-Reeex
I wish I love a little weight on it, I might band

Imma pull up on her, eat on that pussy and dip
Imma keep one inside the table like whip
Dang the girl small, Like she smaller than milk
Have her on my side like a fucking hip
She goin make sure I survive, She goin do it well
Baby I just want them thighs, right under that belt
She just want me to keep them lies all to myself
She goin help me like she sell them L's

I had to hit her from the back of the Bugatti
I don't know what it is but there's something about her
When she around, she do something to me and I can't dodge it
I don't know what it is but it's about her
Shawty got me fucked up blowing O's
Her ex-nigga, he fucked up and don't give no fuck about it
But I'll do whatever when it comes down to shawty
The feds asking questions, I don't know shit about it
It's something bout' lil shawty that I can't put my finger on
It's something 'bout lil shawty, She rather texting me on phone
If somebody try to say, Ain't that rich homie girl?
Lil shawty the best in my eyes and I know
She don't do fuck shit, She don't even go out of doors
Before she was ready, you already knew I know
Shawty make me sick, I'm feeling like I go a cold
Don't forget about my bro (What you tell em Thugga!)

Imma pull up on her, eat on that pussy and dip
Imma keep one inside the table like whip
Dang the girl small, Like she smaller than milk
Have her on my side like a fucking hip
She goin make sure I survive, She goin do it well
Baby I just want them thighs, right under that belt
She just want me to keep them lies all to myself
She goin help me like she sell them L's
It's something about her Thugga, It's something about her

Imma pull up, eat on that pussy and dip
Imma keep one inside the table like whip
Dang the girl small, Like she smaller than milk
Have her on my side like a fucking hip
She goin make sure I survive, She goin do it well
Baby I just want them thighs, right under that belt
She just want me to keep them lies all to myself
She goin help me like she sell them L's
