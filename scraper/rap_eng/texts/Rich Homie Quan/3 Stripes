[Hook]
They taking lessons like I’m teaching
No reverend, they swear I’m preaching
He bless me every time I need it
I swear that I won’t mislead her
I care but she the one who cheated
I was there when she felt unneeded
Since she wanna act tough I'mma call you Stan Smith
Gave that ho three stripes just like some high top Adidas
Gave that ho three stripes just like some shell toe Adidas
Gave that ho three stripes, gave that ho three stripes
Gave that ho three stripes, gave that ho three stripes
Like a Atlanta pitcher

[Verse]
Three stripes she get
Three stripes and it's over
Three stripes like a pitcher
I'll curveball your ho
Three stripes like Stan Smith
I don't want no [?]
In other words no handout
I’mma get it on my own
Head shot if I want it, smashin on my opponents
She can’t keep her mouth closed, that girl like "Oooh"
They can hear me say it a little louder like "Oooooooooh"
I feel so lost right now (Oooh)
I can't even talk right now (Oooh)
Still walking around with it
Still got pounds of midget
Niggas still smoking mid, but they don't wanna admit to it
Cause they afraid [?]
I was broke, I remember them days
You can ask anybody, I was getting that cake [?]
But now I’m lost

I feel so lost right now
