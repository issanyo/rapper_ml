[Intro]
30 you a fool for this one

[Chorus]
I put in work, I was a foot soldier, you was a lead runner
Better invest, you can't hustle forever, them feds comin'
Went did my partner go out bad I should have said somethin'
Play dead on 'em, they tried to rob him, he fled on 'em
I keep that 30 and a Bible by the bed homie
Last situation got a little bloody, left a little bread on 'em
No more handouts, I’m done wit it, can’t help ya nigga
In this game called life, you know every man for theyself nigga

[Verse 1]
(Talk to 'em Rich Homie)
Every man for theyself, that what my people taught me (that what my people taught me)
Blood suckin' ticks, tryna keep the leeches off me (get the fuck up off me nigga)
Spray a lil' cologne, tryna keep the reefer off me (that right too)
Multiply and division, what my teacher taught me
Celebratin' life everyday, kickin' shit on another level
Can’t do it by myself, me and my team had to come together
And we may have differences but we talk 'em out, yeah amongst the fellas
Standin' in the driveway, me and Monta wit a bunch of hittas

[Chorus]
I put in work, I was a foot soldier, you was a lead runner
Better invest, you can't hustle forever, them feds comin'
Went did my partner go out bad I should have said somethin'
Play dead on 'em, they tried to rob him, he fled on 'em
I keep that 30 and a Bible by the bed homie
Last situation got a little bloody, left a little bread on 'em
No more handouts, I’m done wit it, can’t help ya nigga
In this game called life, you know every man for theyself nigga

[Verse 2]
I watch my patna go broke, he was up a whole mill (that right too)
I done been hurt so many times, I ain't got no feelings (too many times)
When I talk to a man look him in his eye, that's how you know I’m serious
And I know I’m different, I’m so ambitious, I go and get it (hey, hey)
Countin’ that money, I ain't need no assistance (nah nigga)
I'm Michael Jordan, you a Scottie Pippen (I'm 23, ball)
And if they don't get the message then it's questions, what they still askin' (say what?)
Lookin' at my bling, countin' my rings, Phil Jackson

[Chorus]
I put in work, I was a foot soldier, you was a lead runner
Better invest, you can't hustle forever, them feds comin'
Went did my partner go out bad I should have said somethin'
Play dead on 'em, they tried to rob him, he fled on 'em
I keep that 30 and a Bible by the bed homie
Last situation got a little bloody, left a little bread on 'em
No more handouts, I’m done wit it, can’t help ya nigga
In this game called life, you know every man for theyself nigga
