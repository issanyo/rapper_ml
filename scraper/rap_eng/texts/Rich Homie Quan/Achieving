[Intro]
I wake up every day and first and foremost I thank God, nahmsayin
'Cause a lot of people didn’t wake up, haha
But I did nigga
I told my kids I love 'em too
Most importantly, I love my motherfuckin’ team nigga
That boy Cass

[Chorus]
Where they do that? Boy turn on your location
Ain’t never had nothin’, use that for motivation
Shine on them niggas, so what if they hatin'
Can’t rush what God got for you, you got to have patience
Never said that it would be easy
Never give up, know you can achieve it
If you got kids then let them be the reason
That you go hard for as long as you're breathin'

[Verse 1]
I been workin' wit no days off, blind to the bullshit, baby I'm Ray Charles
Stay down Quan I promise this shit here gon' pay off
I don't dance but I might Harlem shake the hate off
Been about my paper I'ma business man
Don’t give me the fire 'cause I might hit his ass
I had my eyes close but I was listenin'
Might get lost on somebody island, Giligan
Tell me when them nigga turn they back what you gon' do dawg?
Sideways talkin’ 'bout the situation lose yours
It ain't never 'bout no money boy when you talk
Converted to a safe ya know it used to be a shoebox

[Chorus]
Where they do that? Boy turn on your location
Ain’t never had nothin’ use that for motivation
Shine on them niggas, so what if they hatin'
Can’t rush what God got for you, you got to have patience
Never said that it would be easy
Never give up, know you can achieve it
If you got kids then let them be the reason
That you go hard for as long as you're breathin'

[Verse 2]
Hurry up and give it to 'em don’t make 'em wait long
Shawty hurt my feelings had to stay strong
Bags under my eyes been up all day long
It’s hard to see my pain when I got shades on
Don’t cross that gun line boy stay in the safe zone
Accept my call if I dial out on this pay phone
Walk in the bank, make a deposit, it won’t take long
For no reason I gave 'em somethin' else to hate on
Face shown everywhere I go because I’m good nigga
Spot off on in the hills but never go Hollywood nigga
I ain't worried 'bout no nigga I brought my gun in this bitch
Make sure you retire my number when I'm done wit this shit

[Chorus]
Where they do that? Boy turn on your location
Ain’t never had nothin’, use that for motivation
Shine on them niggas, so what if they hatin'
Can’t rush what God got for you, you got to have patience
Never said that it would be easy
Never give up, know you can achieve it
If you got kids then let them be the reason
That you go hard for as long as you're breathin'
