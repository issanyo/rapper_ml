[Hook]
I'mma turn it up soo loud, I'm gon' wake the neighbors
Bitches hands up, I on't do no favors
On the first day of school, had a book bag full of paper
Niggas stand in line, I rather stack table
Hoe go get a table, table, table
Bitch I need a table, table, table
I just broke the table, table, table
I need somewhere to sit, tell the world go find a table, table, table

[Verse 1]
All know get that pipe, big claw
Back and forth are the ways to get the table
And now I'm standin' up, tryna find a bitch to cater
If other niggas who lovin', I solute you for a hater
I solute these bitch crazy, yet I ain't still got a table
All she try to trap me with a baby
Ho you must be trippin', tell my bitches, tell my neighbors
Tell the waitress bring the table, table, table

[Hook]
I'mma turn it up soo loud, I'm gon' wake the neighbors
Bitches hands up, I on't do no favors
On the first day of school, had a book bag full of paper
Niggas stand in line, I rather stack table
Hoe go get a table, table, table
Bitch I need a table, table, table
I just broke the table, table, table
I need somewhere to sit, tell the world go find a table, table, table

[Verse 2]
Got a fine for goin' hard, you know I paid it off
You ain't even in the million if you ain't got a tablecloth
Okay I paired it, refuse to take a lost
Nobody helped me, but at 17, I was made a boss
Say my name four times, got her text me crazy
Liquid game court side, I'm flexin', baby
Naked lady, I'm those OG niggas
If you were takin' place then I don't know you niggas
I'm stand on the table like where the waitress at
3 hours I've been waitin' and she ain't made it back
Hoe you crazy, don't you see I have this papers?
Lookin' for the waiter, why I'm standin' on the table
And I don't know what to say than I'm a rich nigga
And I get money daily, can it, appreciate it

[Hook]
I'mma turn it up soo loud, I'm gon' wake the neighbors
Bitches hands up, I on't do no favors
On the first day of school, had a book bag full of paper
Niggas stand in line, I rather stack table
Hoe go get a table, table, table
Bitch I need a table, table, table
I just broke the table, table, table
I need somewhere to sit, tell the world go find a table, table, table
