[Intro: Rich Homie Quan]
Aye Nard
It's 'bout that time bro

[Hook: Rich Homie Nard + Rich Homie Quan]
A pocket full of stones that's what made me
Jumped off the porch and hit the block
So you ain't gotta give me nothing
I work hard for what I got so that mean
That you ain't taking nothing
You ain't ever gonna take nothing from me nigga
I put that on everything
You ain't gonna take Nothing from me nigga
That's on everything
You ain't gonna take nothing from me nigga
That's on everything
Put that on my mama
My daddy, my brotha and my sista too
My uncles, my aunties, my nieces and my nephews
And you ain't gonna never take nothing from me
Even if I was dead, casket closed
You still couldn't take nothing from me

[Bridge: Rich Homie Quan]
On my mama
Not on my daddy
Not on my kid
Not on my family
I got nominated in the hood for a grammy
I was touching white at 18 just like mayonnaise

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Nard]
Talking 'bout taking something from me
That's how niggas get killed
Talking to him like you gonna do something
That ain't how you built
The truth is you don't do shit
​​​That's just how you feel
In other words, shut the fuck up
Keep your mouth accusealed
I never been a hoe, What you think I got these pistols for?
These niggas don't fight no more
I'll bring it to your mama front door
If its pressure or its beef, then it needs to cease
Cause they can't run you back with no receipts
Boy I swear

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Every night, I hit my knees before I go to sleep and pray to God
Sometimes I don't, Lord forgive me, amen
Because they just don't know
What we did to the last security guard
Tell 'em whats in my Balmain jeans​​​

[Hook: Rich Homie Nard + Rich Homie Quan]
A pocket full of stones that's what made me
Jumped off the porch and hit the block
So you ain't gotta give me nothing
I work hard for what I got so that mean
That you ain't taking nothing
You ain't ever gonna take nothing from me nigga
I put that on everything
You ain't gonna take nothing from me nigga
That's on everything
You ain't gonna take nothing from me nigga
That's on everything
Put that on my mama
My daddy, my brotha and my sista too
My uncles, my aunties, my nieces and my nephews
And you ain't gonna never take nothing from me
Even if I was dead, casket closed
You still couldn't take nothing from me

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
On my mama I love you
I ​​​promise to put no one above you
Like Osama, Osama, got guns if you get in trouble
I got dudes in Chicago
Fuck with one, be there in a double
I don't play with the law
I'd rather sit back get blow like a trap
Nigga can't ask me for nothing, can't even ask for no hand out
Eazy-E, no HIV,  but I know I'm the man now
She tried to pull my pants down
But I wouldn't let her, ok
I'm all about them bands now
Bout green like I'm zelda
Nothing don't matter me no more
Ever since I lost my grandma
She wasn't there to see me get my first award
And shit, that hurt my heart
These young niggas going brazy
They don't even know what they're doing
They just following these niggas
They don't know what they're pursuing
Cause you got a fact
That don't mean you got to have one
Cash on
Leave it all to the Lord

I put that on everything
You ain't gonna take nothing from me nigga

My daddy, my brotha and my sista too
My uncles, my aunties, my nieces and my nephews

On my mama

Flex on em, oooh oooh ooh oooooh
