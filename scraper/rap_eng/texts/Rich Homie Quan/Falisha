[Hook: Quavo]
I ain't gotta ask no nigga for a whip
I ain't gotta ask no nigga for a zip
I ain't gotta ask no nigga for a ride
I ain't gotta ask no nigga for a dime
I ain't gotta  ask no nigga for nothing
I ain't gotta ask no nigga for nothing
Falisha, I ain't gotta ask no nigga
I ain't askin' no nigga, don't ask me, nigga
Falisha, I ain't gotta ask that nigga
I ain't askin' no nigga for shit, nigga
Falisha, act like Falisha, act like Falisha
Falisha, you act like Falisha, you act like Falisha

[Verse 1: Quavo]
No I'm not askin' you niggas for nothin' because I don't need 'em
When I was down bad, was I really askin' you people?
I was hurtin', I really had to kick them doors and do shit illegal
Then we took off, at the top floor of the continental
Yep top floor, criss cross the block like the eyes on Debo (cock-eyed)
Gon' get my money, bitch and keep your eyes on the road
And then she asked me where we goin', I don't know
What's all of these questions for?
You actin' like your name Falisha, ho
Back then I was in everything
They thought I had legs like a centipede
Got tired of runnin' to my mama for shit
So I kicked me a door in at 17
All of my brothers depend on me
All of my sisters depend on me
Don't run up on me askin' me for nothin'
'Cause I'm takin' my people across the country

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Offset]
The fuck is you thinkin'
You think I'ma ask for some Benjis? Fuck is you thinkin'?
If a nigga ask me do I need somethin', I get offended, come on
By myself, nigga, I'm independent
Breakin' the law with no codefendant
Go to jail, I get a lesser sentence
No niggas 'round me so ain't no snitchin'
Mansion, I own it
Jewelry, I own it, 'Rari, I own it
I used to beat up the pot, Adrian Broner
Aligator loafer, crocodile hunter
Young nigga I don't need assistance
But I still got an assistant
It's nothin' to go buy a Bentley
Unlike you lil' niggas, pockets on empty
When it come to the guala they callin' me Polomalu (run to the money)
Brokanese niggas still wearin' Prada
You know you broke, you don't think that's a problem
Askin' for money, that's not an option
Fuckin' your bitch then I took her shoppin'
Different color diamonds, Dennis Rodman
If I throw gotti, turn to a goblin

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
Stop beggin' ho
When she came to the car askin' for the microwave
Prolly fuckin' Falisha
Shout out Debo, he be gettin' a ho for everything
Young Migo my people
Yeah that Rich Homie shit runnin' through everything
Get bust by them people
Interrogation room, boy I swear I can't tell a name
Hundred thousand, bought a new car
Get wrong at the mouth, I'ma break your shit
And let a hundred thousand buy a new mouth
And I'm up any time
Just spent another two hundred thousand dollars on a new loft
Couple thousand, that don't mean you a boss
I got another 500 stashed behind the wall
Quavo do too, Offset do too
