[Intro]
Uhm, you thirsty (x8)
You boo-boo, you T'd, you turned down, you thirsty, you boo-boo[x4]

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
Chasing them bright lights, even change your name
Say you my boss now, ain't nothing out your range
Well, almost anything

[Pre-Chorus]
You used to be Mister-all-about-we
Now you’re just thirsty for celebrity
Best thing that happened to your ass was me
Pull down them Tom Fords, and act like you see

[Chorus]
You thirsty for a dream leaving me drowning
Boy, there ain't no SOS
Filled with discontent
Finding you can’t quit
Why you try so damn hard?

[Bridge]
Uhm, you thirsty (x8)
You boo-boo, you T'd, you turned down, you thirsty, you boo-boo![x4]

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
Somebody get this girl a glass water
I say she six nickels, not a dime, past a quarter
Her daddy question me why she thirsty nigga ask your daughter
Back up off me, you look a little salty
So thirsty, should drink coffee
And you ain't really gotta keep hitting my phone
I see every message
Texting me asking where I'm going, baby girl, stop stressin'
Then I walked in like the man of the year
With these thirsty girls in my section
These thirsty girls want a blessin'
Get wet, you won't get this shit from me
No defense, but you can get the D
No sequel, it's only one of me
That thirsty bitch just slit my tires, it got me on fire
Rich Homie Quan times Mariah - sing!

[Bridge]
Boss now, you tryna be a boss now, thinking you a boss now
Boy, you just fuckin' thirsty
Boss now, you tryna be a boss now, thinking you a chief now
Boy, you just fuckin' thirsty

[Outro]
See your name in lights, and dream of fancy cars
Like superstars, you don’t know who you are
That VIP too far for you to see
Outside the club adding me constantly
Can’t get the real math, yeah yeah
Cause boy, you’re thirsty, yeah yeah
