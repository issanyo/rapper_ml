[Verse 1:]
It's crazy how the tables turned, now I'm up
I was broke now them back ends all i'm counting up
Got some hope, then start rapping now I'm getting dough
Me stop rapping? Hell no, when I'm at 50 for a show
Hope you ready we can go to war
But I got shit to live for, gotta feed my two little boys
And I got a ho named Crystal, swallowing [?]
I might slice you up with this pimpin', cuz I'm Zelda with this sword
Oooh, I rented a yacht for the week and I sailed across the water
Then ran out with a fifty pack and left his ass with a quarter
Fuck that bitch, Quan don't say that you might have a daughter
Might just rob a bank and set this bitch off just like'

[Hook:]
Vivica A Fox, Set it off
Vivica A Fox, Set it off
Queen Latifah I might just fucking set it off
Get away with that money Jada Pinkett set it off
Set it off, Set it off (like the movie)
Set it off, Set it off ( Queen Latifah)
I might set it off
I don't get my guns from Dr Dre but I swear I'll set it off

[Verse 2:]
Set it off like the  movie, claim me you ain't got a ride
Guess what? I'm gon' call a Uber
I ran off on Raymond lame ass, cuz he a nuisance
Cuz he claim he got aim
That don't mean his lame ass gon' shoot it
Plain Janes I'm boolin
I heard you wanted some work, I know the guy
I set it off like a smoke detector, cause I'm on fire
We can go to Maury take the lie detector test, baby so don't lie
Maybe I won't try to not set it off like--
