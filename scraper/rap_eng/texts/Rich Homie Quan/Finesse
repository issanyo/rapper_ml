[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
We got the bricks and the yay
We got that shit you don't weigh
We get them package of loud
I got that shit from the Bay
I know some Crips in L.A
I know some Bloods out in Harlem
I got my bitch on the way
She got a bitch on the way
I got some niggas, they put the clips in the K
I got some chicks in the A
You took a trip to Miami
You get a drop, you get that shit for a day
I get that shit cause I want it
I'm in that shit gettin' blunted
I'm in that shit doin' me
Let your new bitch get up on it
I do not care about warrants
I told my lawyer to steam it
Any charges that they throw
I told my lawyer to clean it

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan + A$AP Ferg]
I want the bricks and the commas
I want some more and some more
I got them bricks and the commas
I want galore and galore
I am not talkin' 'bout Lira
I fell in love with the mirror
Damages, look at my hair
I fucked your bitch in the Leer
Twitter fingers in her rear
Make that pussy disappear, yeah, yeah
I dropped a 4 in a 20 and Fanta
NYC all the way down to Atlanta
I rock your bitch like a Gucci bandana
I'm feelin' myself just like Tony Montana
I snort the caine, nah, Tony Montana
I got the mothafuckin' gun
I got the hammer, I'll put my dick in your grandma
Don't ask me why I call you son
I cannot fuck her, I'm focused on money
Focused on 20s and 50s and hundreds
Finessin' the plug, we take off and we're runnin'
I can have a rich homie, you know that we stuntin'
I want that green so they callin' me Kermit
Man that boo got me hot, man I feel like I'm burnin'
I beat that lil' pussy like Ike, call me Turner
So get that G string like I just pulled a permit
