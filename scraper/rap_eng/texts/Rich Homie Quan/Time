[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I just gotta be patient
I know that deal comin', but it ain't came yet, I'm still waitin'
No complainin'
And I'm grateful cause I know it take a little time
I say I know it take a little time, time
But if I just be a little patient I'ma get that car I wanted
If I be a little bit patient, I'ma get that house I wanted
And I know it take a little time
You see I made an oath to my family
And I ain't braggin'
But that's why them broke niggas can't stand me

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Growin' up I ain't have shit so birthdays meant a lot to me
Thanksgiving, it was Hell, nigga, and I stayed up on Christmas Eve
And I ain't have shit under the Christmas tree
But I still ain't blame my mama
Real talk, it motivated me to go and get them commas
They say I got too much of it, I tell 'em that ain't enough
But that money, I fell in love with it, doubled it, ran it up
And she claimin' that she in love with me, tell her explain herself
Cause you just like the rest of these other hoes
Bitch you ain't shit like your daddy and your brother
And I want everything to be clear, I ain't mothafuckin' stutter
Me and Thug gotta hit like Mayweather
A whole zip, that'll make a nigga day better
Young nigga with me, you don't wanna play with him
I'm tired of waitin', but...

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I just gotta be patient
I know that deal comin', but it ain't came yet, I'm still waitin'
No complainin'
And I'm grateful cause I know it take a little time
I say I know it take a little time, time
But if I just be a little patient I'ma get that car I wanted
If I be a little bit patient, I'ma get that house I wanted
And I know it take a little time
You see I made an oath to my family
And I ain't braggin'
But that's why them broke niggas can't stand me

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Take off like a missile, gon' and live a little
White Balls In Her Crystals, young Quan got a pistol
Ball like Bryant, no Nichols, I can whip a little
I know she can screw the whole team just like a filling
I know I'm gon' break them things down and feed my children
I'm not paralyzed but I really don't got no feelings
No, put my bitch out the door 'fore I do the blow
You play with YSL you get X'd out, oh
Face shots, all we want is face shots
Nigga talkin' 'bout robbin' Quan
Like he ain't walk around with them knots
These niggas super pie, no pot
And I'ma shoot 'em in their eye

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
