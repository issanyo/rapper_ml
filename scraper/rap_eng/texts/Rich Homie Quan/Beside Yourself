[Intro]
Auto start that motherfucker Quan
Hahaa, yeah, aye

[Hook]
I just might pull up in that Bugatti
I just might pull up in that Ferrari
I just might pull up in that 4-5-8
I just might pull up in that new Spider
I pull up by myself no one behind me
Try a nigga like me 100 soldiers ridin'
I might pull up on you catch body
I pull up on you Thursday, fuck a Friday
Boy bullets at yo head like a visor
Got niggas in the bushes and they hidin'
Plus they gone lay on you until you outside it
And they gone make it hard for folks to find ya
I hate to get involved with violence
But you done went too far and got beside yourself
Its only one me stop trying
Cause you could never beat me with the finest help

[Verse]
Pull up on that nigga with the beam
Yeah, what you want lil nigga
If ion't know you I ain't gone serve ya
Nah, what you want lil nigga
My P.O. know my piss dirty
Hmm, what you want from a nigga
I could switch cars up every Thurday
Park the big truck now I'm riding in the donk lil nigga
Shawty stay charged like a Tesla
And every car flexin'
Got a nigga question mark guessin'
I sound good thank the boy Evan
Might strap catch ya
Ballin' on him like George Jetson
Pull up on a nigga with the windows down
Straight shots, shooting at everything we said lil nigga
You mad cause you heard I fucked yo bitch mouth
But a fuck nigga nah, I could never be a lil nigga
Gotta whole lotta money, more problems
Biggie said it, Biggie said it nigga I know it
Kickin shit on these niggas just like soccer
Catchin bullshit in the air just like a goalie
Went to private school nigga just to talk proper
70000 for the bust down rollie
Used to hide weed in my motherfuckin' locker
Boy I pray to God that car not stolen because...
