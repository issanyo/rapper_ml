[Intro: Rich Homie Quan]
Get a chainsaw bro
You feel me
Nigga talkin' crazy like
The pull game ain't stupid

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
It's about to be a chainsaw massacre if I don't get my money
My nigga they coming after ya, told em bring me yo stomach
I hate to get out of character
But I made a promise
To myself that I was going to embarrass ya
Yo ass don't want it
It's about to be a Chainsaw Massacre (3x)
It's about to be a {(Chainsaw)(3x)}
Its about to be a Chainsaw Massacre

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Massacre, I'll blast on em too
I'll blast on em but
His car ride faster than yours
Here Quan here I go I'm faded
Nigga blast it some more
She want all the s'mores
Man I'm behind in the hills in L.A (Hollywood)
I ran my muthafuckin' money to the ceiling
Now I'm living like selfie
I passed a pass like John Elway
Nigga owe me in school, imma catch his ass on the stairway
(And what?) beat him up, beat him up
I spent 5 bands on a pea coat iJ'aime Ã§a feel like King Tut
I sold a whole lot of weed to get these Jamaican bucks
Your bitch in love with the nut
Nigga now she stuck
I might just buy that bitch a loft or a ticket for the bus
You know it

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Chainsaw Massacre I ain't talking about the movie
I ain't with that back in forth, that's why I keep a shooter
Creepin' in that black truck, Thugga got the Uzi
I ain't talkin bout no black uggs, when I say I'm ooglin'
So high that I can't do shit
Don't know why but I need a new bitch
I'm so fine feeling ruthless
I had a date did no pookin'
Get ya knocked off, pull a couple strings, acoustic
Damn right I'm a boss, fuck you mean
Street fighter, Hyuken
Straight like Ryu
A broke nigga can't stand by you
Fuck nigga tryna do everything I do
Im glad, achu
Never stress 'bout you
Shoot his head, he through
