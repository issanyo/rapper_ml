[Verse]
Como te llamas?, me llamo Quan
My Mexican plug don't know where I'm from
He got white, he got coke, he got everythin'
He don't fight, he just shoot, and kill everythin'
They don't move until he give orders
This another story, watch your ass call the border
He got shooter on the roof and got some under water
If I don't come back with his loot then my ass in trouble
I'mma call smokin' goon cause that nigga my brother
I don't like that jail fool, cause that shit feel like rubber
Better watch out for these dudes, most of 'em undercover
We done did a lot of moves, now we plotin' on others
A lot of us ain't have food so we came out the gutter
Get mad, pull out a tool out straight on your mother
I sad we coolin', slash that - boolin'
Got a nigga mouth wide open like he droolin', ugh
Hundred thousand dollar worth of coochie
And I got a new bitch who just wanna screw me, ugh
I don't even really want her booty
I just wanna get in your bed and oochie coochie
I don't know what it is, but somebody, can't move my finger
Hunnid cases got a nigga foamin' by the mouth
I know that she caught me cheatin'
Baby, please don't leave me, is there any way we can talk it out?
I say, I'm all about the dream like Johnny Depp
I pulled up on your ting, but you wasn't there
Balmain jean jacket, bye money clout
Lake Wood marathon, I would run there
Better take care of my mama, 'fore you catch a slug in your stomach
