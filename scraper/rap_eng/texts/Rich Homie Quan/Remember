[Intro]
"Yeah (haha), let me talk my shit nigga"
"Rich Homie my clique nigga"
"Quan, let go"

[Hook]
I done made a little money, fucked a couple bitches
Lost a couple homies, niggas weren't official
Better watch your homies, cause they'll try and get you
Long nights when I was hungry, you know I remember
I done made a little money, fucked a couple bitches
Lost a couple homies, niggas weren't official
Better watch your homies, cause they'll try and get you
Short term memory but I do remember

[Verse 1]
I remember all the times, when a nigga didn't have shit
Used to have a hood rat and now I got a bad bitch
Used to be pork beans, now it's shrimp salad
Standing here with all my jewelry on, cause I ain't never had shit
Bitch I got a Escslade, shoutout to my daddy
Rich Homie got hella ranks, shoutout to my family
Yeah you know my preference, collard greens over cabbage
Gotta fire your lil boy, triffle kissing these rabbits
And phone Gotti I don't want it I done had it
'85 Camaro that bitch nasty
And I'm next to blow on that blunt, I ain't gon' pass it
And some of my niggas say I'm acting funny

[Verse 2]
Pistol still on me, you can get your issue
Baby momma tired or your parent come up missing
This chopper in your mouth then chin check you like a Dennis
Cut them niggas off, if they flimsy
Blimp me, i'm high as fuck, steak & cheese at Blimpy
Give you a haircut, bitch nigga don't tempt me
Shoot a whole motherfucker 'til it's empty
Hundred thousand on features this week
Ripley, simply, I'm harder than these other niggas
Believe me, I'm smarter than these other niggas
Achieve it, go farther than these other niggas
They leeching, can't trust these other niggas...
