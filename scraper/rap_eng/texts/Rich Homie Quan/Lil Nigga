I keep like 10 to 12 bitches in here with me (Oh ain't no way, oh yeah ain't no way)
I told you when they gave me a chance I wouldn't defeat it (Oh ain't no way, oh yeah ain't no way)
These niggas know what's happening with a real nigga
Aye, these niggas know what's brackin' with a real nigga
Aye, yo brain is empty like an attic lil nigga
Got my papi but I live like a bastard lil nigga, lil nigga, lil nigga

[Verse 1 - Young Thug]
I'm Jes√∫s
He gon' come with two like a motherfucking coupe
I got lots of hoes like I'm uncle fuckin' luke
You can catch me at the post I'm sending these bitches through
I, dropped off the top and now that bitch is at the movies
Aye, and after that she let me catch all of the cooties
Walking downtown it's still on me yeah that wooley
I might put my face down if she tell me cause I do this
Lil mama know I do it
Her mama know I do it
They Grandmama know I do it
All ages numbers know how I do it

And my wrist stay frosty like a flake, hold up, hold up, wait

Aye, I keep bout 20,000 at all the time on me
