[Intro]
YA, YA, YA, YA, YA, YAA, YAAAA
YA, Rich Homie Baby YA
Young nigga might rob you for that pack
Okay Ya

[Hook]
Young nigga might rob you for that pack
You need a life jacket
Might take a L on that sack, and get it right back
I Get Back (8x)
Gotta whole lotta work on me
Ain't tryna catch no cell case
Had to flush my real down the toilet when 12 came
I Get Back (8x)

[Verse 1]
I get it back, like i never lost her
I surround myself around sum bosses (Rich Homie Baby)
Yellow diamond got me feeling cautions
And I'm dead fresh without a coffin
With all this lean I drink, It feelin like im sleep walkin
Young nigga might stay two nights straight on that greyhound
With the same outfit like two days straight, You gotta stay down
Fuck what them broke niggas think
You laughing cause you paid now
I ain't meet her top yet
But I were have her face down (Baby)
She laughing at me
All this money in the plastic baby
Dinosaur
Jurassic Park baby
All my cars in the fashion baby
All my bars in the plastic baby
Which means they new, Thats my crew
Nigga im safe, But ion know bout you

[Hook]
Young nigga might rob you for that pack
You need a life jacket
Might take a L on that sack, And get it right back
I Get Back (8x)
Gotta whole lotta work on me
Ain't tryna catch no cell case
Had to flush my real down the tolient when 12 came
I Get Back (8x)

[Verse 2]
She'll never leave me
I squeeze her just like a Capri Sun
And I swear I get her back just like a refund
And she ion walk around with no cash
She keep a VISA
With the bills all in her purse
And I'm back, reimbursed
I memory taking them lost's for a week straight
I memory throwin that pack off on the freeway
And I swear I got it back just like a replay
If I'm on the 1's and 2's
I bring it back just like a DJ
I left a whole zip a my pa's house
All my niggas they dropped out
Bullets shooting, You dancing
Like we playing hopscotch
Got work, no clock out
That mink on me, that fox out
Two cars we mobbin out
Downtown at the robbin spot (Okay)

[Hook]
Young nigga might rob you for that pack
You need a life jacket
Might take a L on that sack, And get it right back
I Get Back (8x)
Gotta whole lotta work on me
Ain't tryna catch no cell case
Had to flush my real down the tolient when 12 came
I Get Back (8x)
