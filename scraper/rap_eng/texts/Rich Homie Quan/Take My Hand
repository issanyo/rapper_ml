Ayy Izzy, I might as well get suited and booted, man. Thinking bout tying the knot bro'. forreal

Hundred thousand dollars for aggravated assault
I didn't want that temp car but a nigga had just bought one

If I want yo bitch boy I bet you'll come up off her
In the outfield with my glove yeah you know I had done caught her
Shawty fine like a muhfucker, yeah
