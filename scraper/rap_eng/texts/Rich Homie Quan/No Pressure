[Intro: Young Jeezy]
I got a lot going on, what the fuck I'mma do?
Would you sit back and chill if this shit happen to you?
You just doing your thing, preoccupied being boss
But these suckers ain't happy unless you taking a loss
See I kick real shit, I'm like a Moses while talking
I'm the king of this shit, y'all drop some roses while I'm walking
I pulled up in my Rolls, I jumped out with some hoes
I'm draped up in this gold up in this Ghost, seen once and she choose, let's go!

[Hook x2: Rich Homie Quan]
You need to talk a little bit louder
I ain't heard nothing you said
Ain't no pressure on no money
I done ran up a little check, and I'm tired

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Ain't no pressure squeeze a rock hard enough, it make a diamond
Hear you niggas talking to much, I get to grinding
They don't want me remixing their song, I Shawty Lo that
That use to hit up bankhead with them zones and shawty know that
I'ma do me and I did I bless Rocko
Rose gold jacob i did it just ask Roscoe
Put Tity on "Count It Up" I knew he was go blow
It was 2 chainz then, now the nigga be rocking 4
Me and J beezy lied to them [?]
Magic city drinking champagne just like its water
Put Future on a song, lets call it way too gone
Told em give me 12 bars, now he way too gone
