[Intro]
Say they gave the wrong young nigga money, you funny
I don't know a nigga by Cinco
Boy your real name Johnny
Seen my little brother with McQueen
Then your ass got to running
Get your ass cut like Michael Turner
On the goal line you the type to fumble
You ain't really come from nothing
Boy I came from the slums
Rich Homie they done gave the wrong young nigga money
First I'ma go get the choppers
Then I'm gon' go get the mag
Pistols hanging out the Rari
We shooting at all of they ass
Grown nigga money, grown nigga money
They gave the wrong nigga money, wrong nigga money
Grown nigga money, grown nigga money
They done gave the wrong nigga money, wrong nigga money

[Verse 1]
Pulled up brand new car
Looking like you can't even afford this, lil' nigga
Talking out the side of your mouth
Better zip lock that before your ass get killed nigga
Talking hard but we know you ain't built nigga
My squad got nothing but them rich niggas
You squad got nothing but them bitch niggas
Body guard for yo ass, better stick with him
Got bars and you know that I'm sick wit it
5 cars and I'm going on 6 nigga
2 spots downtown and I live in them
That shit you talking I been did it
That bitch you cuffing I been hitting
These niggas gettin soft, chinchilla
You ain't realer, than me nigga
OG's fuck with me everyday, I be with them
I was selling out the trunk like P. Miller
When I was just coming up as a beginner
I ain't never give a fuck about these niggas
They ain't never gave a fuck bout me neither
I ain't never put my trust in no people
Coming up Momma always said, "You need Jesus"
I was grinding extra hard like Rocky
In the motherfucking deep freezer
I ain't never ever been a fuck nigga
Ask my homie, I ain't never change up nigga
Are you mad cause I fucked the game up nigga?
Body bags for these lame ass fuck niggas
The pharmacy fuck with me
Still got medicine in my cup nigga
Come and see whats up with me
I done been a lot of shit
But I ain't never been a fuck nigga

[Chorus]
I ain't never been a fuck nigga
I ain't never been a fuck nigga
Never been a fuck nigga
I ain't never been a fuck nigga
I dun been a lot of shit
But i never been a fuck nigga
I ain't never been no fuck nigga
I ain't never been a fuck nigga
Never been a fuck nigga
Never been a fuck nigga
See a fuck nigga shoot a fuck nigga
See a fuck nigga shoot a fuck nigga
See a fuck nigga shoot a fuck nigga
See a fuck nigga shoot a fuck nigga

[Verse 2]
Boy you need to talk a little louder
I ain't heard nothing that you saying
Yeah you know money bring power
In 2 weeks made 100 bands
Never been a fuck nigga
Show you whats up nigga, we can throw hands
And a lot of tips go
When I'm in the strip club
Gotta throw bands
Yea you see me on TV
But a nigga still in the street
Yea i got 2 felonies
But I'm still walking 'round with that heat
And I'm down with that beef
I'll make a nigga eat it
Tryna sound like me cause your ass can't be me
I'ma send shots so yo ass better duck nigga
You know what's up nigga
Yea, I done been broke nigga
But I ain't never been a fuck nigga

[Chorus]
I ain't never been a fuck nigga
I ain't never been a fuck nigga
Never been a fuck nigga
I ain't never been a fuck nigga
I dun been a lot of shit
But i never been a fuck nigga
I ain't never been no fuck nigga
I ain't never been a fuck nigga
Never been a fuck nigga
Never been a fuck nigga
See a fuck nigga shoot a fuck nigga
See a fuck nigga shoot a fuck nigga
See a fuck nigga shoot a fuck nigga
See a fuck nigga shoot a fuck nigga
