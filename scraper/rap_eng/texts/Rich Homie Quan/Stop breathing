(Hook)
So much money, that I lost count and got mad
All these hundreds sitting in the pockets of my pants
I gotta provide for my family so, tell em mind they business
Don’t worry about how Im feelin’, but Im serious when I say we gettin so much money
Spent like 80 thousand on clothes
And I ain’t frontin, I’m talkin this year alone
Now they hatin I’m beastin
Fuck wrong with these people?
Turned on you easy for no reason
I won’t stop going hard til I stop breathing

(Verse)
Please, show me the road, and I’ll take you
Can’t breathe
So I hold my nose til my face blue, ask me
(Don’t ask me shit)
How I’m pposed to know if I hate you? No sleep
The same outfit, that’s the lame you datin too
I made you and I dated you and you replaced it wit yo friend
Wanna play wit you like table food, makin major moves in that Benz
Okay! We gon be straight, I guess it’s safe to say my mama got that sack
All I had to do was just pave the way cus my homies got my back
And they here for me, no ill hustlin
If I’m still losin they’ll cheer for me
You steal from me, they’ll kill something
Everybody got bills comin
My eyes red like Cyclops
And I got…

I won’t stop going hard til I stop breathing

(Verse)
Gotta say my prayer, might not wake them all so I keep
My medicine in that baby bottle, now preach
Got more verses than 80 bibles cus I’m sneakin
Gotta close yo mouth while yo still round me
No stand down like young homie they televising
Wrong verses, better send a deposit
You keep a seat just like you been in a closet
(Better pay attention)
I ain’t gotta lie, man, gon try to let my money take yo girl
And those people were lyin when they said money makes the world
Go round and round like a merry go
I’m getting high but I’m sittin down on my pedestal
I’m a leader, that’s what I tell them folks
And I see far like a telescope
When I talk back they was like oh my God!
I got…
