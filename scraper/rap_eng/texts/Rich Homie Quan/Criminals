Everybody i fuck with around me's a criminal, nigga
I have no square niggas not scared niggas we criminals niggas
Every city i go to I’m plugged up with criminals nigga
Gettin' money y'all side laws, we tryin ta ball like criminals, Nigga
They don’t give a fuck we don't give a fuck, neither
I got money i got hoes
I got work blowing refas nigga
Every city i go to I’m plugged up with criminals nigga
Get money ya’ll side lawns trying to ball like criminals

[Verse 1:]
Err (Every) city i go to i don’t fuck around with no sucker nigga
Just bad women and a couple of thots
They ain't head shottin' (Sucking Dick) in is nothing nigga
I’m posted up this pistol on me
These chains hanging no duckett nigga
We don't give a fuck we wildin out
We shut it down go and bust it nigga
You know I’m getting money when i pull up in that coupe
You know I’m after you when i pull up tryna shoot
I do it BIG by the way i was getting loose
In the club 50 nigga and everyone of them mute
Niggers mad because they use to got me trying to hear them
If you don’t want to loose your bitch you better come and get her
If she ain’t rocking with the team then i ain’t trying to fuck her
If she wasn't about the money then i wouldn't be with her
I am the king pin no telling what I’m on
I know they hating they don't pull up until I’m going
I follow that pussy nigga got i going
I fall off back back to do work and get my name on it
Got the hood in the headlock the streets tell me I’m high
Why the fuck you think that I’m not
Realest nigga if im dead or not
Ilm a probably give them hell until my breath stops

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Every city i go to I’m fucking up them bad bitches
And you best know It's a big problem if i have the louie V bag with me
I can rap a whole song off an ad-lib
I can pull up on a brand new topic
Better bring that money come if you have it
Call me young fabtastic
Stay true from the truth
Got a hundred thousand dollars in the mother fucking coupe
Just stop and shoot gotta a pocket full of loot
Metal finger fuck you nigga
D mixes everyday
The feds know they talking 3 ways
Shorty make me hang in it three days
Spend my own i don't give a fuck what you want to say
Turn that beat up now shorty come dance with me
I know that with money shorty comes into my hand easily
Say the wrong thing and I’m leavin yo' ass missin
And i just bought a bentley and it shorty came with me
We got but now's for the chops
And  now panties she going to drop  and to the floor she don’t to stop
All them nigga robbing
