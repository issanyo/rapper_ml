[Intro]
Yeah, aye, aye

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
I said they heard that I'm a boss, I gotta motherfucking prove it
Freezer full a niggas, she like "Quan, you the coolest"
Bitch, you watching me like a motherfucking movie
I got four hoes a piece in the pool and my jacuzzi, toothless
Cuz I'm spittin' like a motherfucking infant, ruthless
Top gone and I'm ridin' on skinnies, Coupes
Her top gone and she hidin' behind the tinted, dueces
To them fuck niggas who never thought I wouldn't be shit
On some G shit, MOB shit, that Louie V on me
And I keep it like a free bitch, that Glock 40 on me (not you niggas)
And I'm back off in the kitchen, you don't know about it
The pack have 'em itching, just like poison ivy
I got GPS bullets that will go and find him
Name a nigga better than me, I'm a go and sign him
All my niggas eye to eye, never go behind him
Tell yo ho remind him, chop and screw rewind him

[Verse 2: RichHomie Quan]
Okay now, since it's hard to find me, binoculars see me farther
In trap like a spider, my name should be Peter Parker
Blowing that Mary Jane while popping them Green Goblins
Dora hanging off the hinges from keeping them fiends knocking
I got ounces in my jean pocket, thats how we rocking
With a check like Nike I could never Rebok it
If Nard ain't got no more 82, he gone have to ship it
Geometric numbers call me the math mathematician
I'm a add it, then subtract it, move the pack in the fastest
Stretch it backwards, like elastic, dramatic
Money convo I can't hear a hater
How could I forget the baking soda in the refrigerator

[Hook: RichHomie Quan] [x2]
I'm still going in on these nigga's asses (x2)
I refuse to grab a pen on these nigga's asses
I got the torch now and I don't know if I'm a pass it
