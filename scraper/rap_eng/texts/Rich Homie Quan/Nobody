[Intro]
Funny how everybody say they know me
Man I don't know you
Fuck you talkin' bout

[Verse 1]
Nobody had my back when I was down
And I wasn't stuntin' cause I had to watch my back to get around
Everybody at yo sack, look at em now
They don't understand until you sit em down
[?] been around I was gangsta nigga
I stayed down from the ground, now I'm famous nigga
I'd like to thank my niggas
Ain't nobody right these wrongs
Ain't nobody make these songs
Ain't nobody shoot my strap
Ain't nobody, Quan
When I was locked up, who was down?
Nobody
Who gon stop us, who now?
Nobody
You must be trippin', it's a Benz, ho
No Audi
Thank God for [?]
Nobody

[Hook]
I will never tell on nobody
I ain't gonna flex for nobody
I ain't sayin shit on nobody
Nah I ain't scared of nobody
Ha, she all head, no body
And as a kid, had no friends, nobody
So, when I get rich, split it with nobody
I play to win, like I don't know nobody
Alien, John Doe, nobody

[Verse 2]
37 hundred for the engine, nobody
Her jeans fallin' off because she skin, and no body
She love to talk but she won't listen to nobody
When I first met you, you was just a nobody
I ain't gotta flex for nobody (what's in it for me)
Cause I don't care bout nobody else
Cause you that bitch that stayed down [?]
No fallin' off, you'll never be like what happened to me
Nobody, what the hell you at
So I put nobody, in your spot, you first
And I don't care bout nobody else, but you girl
I love you, 3 words, I ain't sayin' shit, I know he hurt

[Hook x2]
