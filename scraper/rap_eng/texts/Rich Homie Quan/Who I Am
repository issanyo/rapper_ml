[Intro]
I know I fucked up, shorty
Forgive me
You know what I'm saying?
Not for the mistakes

[Hook]
But for who I am, I know I fucked up and cannot bring it back
Thank the Lord for where I'm at because I came up with no cash
They went from bando to the bondos, you would think I'm moving crack
I got dineros, I got hundros in this dummy-ass Louis bag
Every day that I wake up a nigga never ever scared
I thank God when I wake up ‘cause a nigga could've been dead
Like a certified barber, I got money on your head
Hey listen

[Verse 1]
Money under the mattress, chopper under my bed
Tyler Perry, y'all acting, y'all niggas be playin'
I stopped fucking with the packages, too many of y'all feds
I know I gotta die anyway, big ol' trust fund for my kids
I need some ear plugs for my ears (Why Quan?)
These niggas ain't talking 'bout shit, these days, for real
Can't trust these niggas just like eBay, no deal
House so big on a hill
Couch in the room where I live, I heard your girl got skills
With her mouth and her tongue, yeah, but I can't judge her
I ain't like others, girl (Baby I'm different)
Show me where's your heart, I'll give you everything, don't creep on me
Had to wake they ass up, at first they would sleep on me

[Hook]
But for who I am, I know I fucked up and cannot bring it back
Thank the Lord for where I'm at because I came up with no cash
They went from bando to the bondos, you would think I'm moving crack
I got dineros, I got hundros in this dummy-ass Louis bag
Every day that I wake up a nigga never ever scared
I thank God when I wake up ‘cause a nigga could've been dead
Like a certified barber, I got money on your head
Hey listen

[Verse 2]
Now I'm back like I left something
I ain't left nothing but my head in between her legs (Ugh), Quan nasty
Give it to me, I ain't askin', for the pussy I'm an addict
I can't hear what you saying like a jail call, too much static
Treat the bitch like a throwaway ‘cause you know the lil hoe trashy
She telling me she wanna go away, but she know a young nigga ain't havin' it
S I T H, I swear my [?]
She grew up with no father figure, that's why she call me Daddy
She ain't worried 'bout a lame nigga, he a has been
She swearing that she bad, nigga, bitch you average
I ain't tryin' to share ya if I can't have ya
I shoot you in your face before I back stab ya
Hm, hold on, wait

[Hook]
But for who I am, I know I fucked up and cannot bring it back
Thank the Lord for where I'm at because I came up with no cash
They went from bando to the bondos, you would think I'm moving crack
I got dineros, I got hundros in this dummy-ass Louis bag
Every day that I wake up a nigga never ever scared
I thank God when I wake up ‘cause a nigga could've been dead
Like a certified barber, I got money on your head
Hey listen
