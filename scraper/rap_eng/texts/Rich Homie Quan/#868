[Intro: Rich Homie Quan and (Trinidad James)]
RHQ (Piarco!)
(All around the world)
I done been to alot of places, everybody know that (ATL)
All around the world (Trinidad!)
But I ain't never been to Trinidad
You feel me, aye my brother Trinidad (868)

[Hook: Rich Home Quan]
Five thousand dollars ain't shit
Might as well take a trip
I ain't never been to Trinidad before
Imma take five bitches cause I don't know nobody
But I bet my nigga Trinidad knows
Got Trinidad girls, got Trinidad hoes
But I ain't never ever been to Trinidad before
But I know that imma go cause Trinidad told me
But I ain't never been to Trinidad before

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
(James)
I need 40 new bottles of that GT Vodka
Me and Quan landed in Piarco like shottas
Girls see my chain drop dead like a possum
Rich homies in the hood
Man I swear it ain't a problem
From Morvant to Laventille
St. James to Port of Spain
From Curepe to Trincity
The whole Diego Martin
They gon' ride for me
They gon' die for me
Cause that's all my family
Red black and white my flag
That dont mean no gang
We Trinidadian (I need a fool)

[Hook: Rich Home Quan]
Five thousand dollars ain't shit
Might as well take a trip
I ain't never been to Trinidad before
Imma take five bitches cause I don't know nobody
But I bet my nigga Trinidad knows
Got Trinidad girls, got Trinidad hoes
But I ain't never ever been to Trinidad before
But I know that imma go cause Trinidad told me
But I ain't never been to Trinidad before

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Need a vacation
I wanna go I gotta passport
Pay whatever I keep a stash on me (money, James)
Trinidad homie (my nigga)
Keep 'bout 50 cash on me (racks)
If you ain't real I cut you off like its my last homie
Hey this ain't Vegas I can't deal if you gon' crap on me
When I make it to Trinidad we're gon' blast off
Fast car
[?] made that motherfucker sit up like a rocket
No NASA
Emblem sit up Rolls Royce this is not a Jaguar
Kimbo, no slice
Ima cut that bitch up
Oooh
Ima eat up that pretty lil' pussy like food
Trinidad hoes send me pictures, they nude
Me and Trinidad swear we were none but them [?]
I bang louboutin bottles the same color as my shoes
I keep my pockets on blue
All hunnids
They bring the drugs [?]
Big and purple, call it [?]
I tell my bros I don't offer no cash
Let me check my louie bag (hol' up, wait, I got one, two, three, four...)

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
Five thousand dollars ain't shit
Might as well take a trip
I ain't never been to Trinidad before
Imma take five bitches cause I don't know nobody
But I bet my nigga Trinidad knows
Got Trinidad girls, got Trinidad hoes
But I ain't never ever been to Trinidad before
