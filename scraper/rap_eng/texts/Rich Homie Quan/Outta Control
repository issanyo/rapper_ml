[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I just lost my mind, now I’m out of control
Molly got me geeked up, I’m out of control
[?] to the face got me out of control
Four bitches in here and they out of control
Out of control, out of control
Molly got me geeked up, I’m out of control
Go back to the bay, got me out of control
I just lost my mind, now I’m out of control

[Verse 1: Skally]
I got four bitches with me, out of control
They geeked up off that molly, these hoes don’t want to go home
They straight out of the strip club, fresh off the pole
I swear these bitches turnt, they just want dick and some patron
It’s on
When I pop two [?], I’m out my mind, I swear
I get so dead, you would think I’m gone, I’m fried
You can look me in my eyes and see I’m high, and I’m still gon drive
Out of control up 75, and I’m flying
And I’m fly, my wings on
I paid a half a rack to put these robin jeans on
Imma need a couple mil to put me and my team on
Watch it get out of control when they play my theme song
(nigga I’m cutting out)

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I just lost my mind, now I’m out of control
Molly got me geeked up, I’m out of control
[?] to the face got me out of control
Four bitches in here and they out of control
Out of control, out of control
Molly got me geeked up, I’m out of control
Go back to the bay, got me out of control
I just lost my mind, now I’m out of control

[Verse 2: Skally]
I just lost my mind, I’m out of control
I woke up in the telly wasted with four different hoes
Four different bitches, so many licks, four different phones
I banged a couple zips and bought a few Rich Homie songs
Shit out of control, I can’t control it
I just drank like eight zips of lean, so I can’t patron it
I hit the club off of that molly, Imma have my moment
They play my shit, we cutting up, and it got me going
Nigga I’m turnt
Now I’m standing up on that chair
Throwing money up in that air
I’m smacking hoes in they ass
Might pull a bitch by her hair
But she getting paid, she don’t care
We cool, we make a swimming pool
So she gon' let us act a fool

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I just lost my mind, now I’m out of control
Molly got me geeked up, I’m out of control
[?] to the face got me out of control
Four bitches in here and they out of control
Out of control, out of control
Molly got me geeked up, I’m out of control
Go back to the bay, got me out of control
I just lost my mind, now I’m out of control
