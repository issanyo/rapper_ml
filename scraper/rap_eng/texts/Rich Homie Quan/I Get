[Intro]
A lot of times
I be having a lot on my mind right
So I sit back on my bed, and look up at the ceiling
Cause I feel like, this shit ain't for me

[Bridge]
It may seem like life don't love you no more
I done had dreams like that felt so real I thought I was woke
Sometimes I feel like I wanna give up with no hope
Why does it feel like a nigga fucking with me cause of what I do?

[Hook]
I get the picture
I get you niggas
I get money, I get bitches
I get 100's, I get 50's
I get checks over a 20
I get checks buss 'em if they over 20
I'll buss yo bitch, only if she over 20
I got my bitch just incase you niggas creepin'
She'll buss at him, if I hear that nigga creepin'

[Verse 1]
A couple million (I got)
A couple hunnid thousands in stock nigga
And a couple businesses (I got)
A seven year old lil boy these folks don't know (I got)
Problems like they do
Who fucked up? I did
When she asked for money, who asked for custody? (I did, I swear to God I did)
I swear I told my first lil boy he could have whatever (On me)
Million dollar trust fund (on me)
If he wants something (on me)
But they just so young they don't see
They daddy be gone gotta feed they two mouths
That ain't easy
Try to let 'em know it ain't 'bout me
It's about them, gotta let 'em know
Woah woah woah
If you gotta nigga locked up let me hear you say:
Woah Woah woah
If you know a nigga dead let me hear you scream:
Woah woah woah
Lighters up pouring liquor out like:
Woah Woah Woah
Pulled up on them niggas like:
Woah Woah
Fake boy take my alazay, and my bike you gone be like:
Woah woah
Nigga dissin' ima have that shit out on my hand screaming like:
Woah woah
She want my ho
Bank account got O's

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ridin round with 20 bags in the trunk
But that ain't none of my business, I got my own problems
My daddy still in the hospital
Just lost my grand-mama (grand-mama grand-mama)
I come from where you don't come from
I from the slums, aka, the fucking jungle
I want that tongue if I hear yo ass mumble
Look about me, go to .com but
Looking for my white Tee
Don't give up just because

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Outro]
In order to get something you ain't never got
You gotta do something you ain't never had to do
Step out the box nigga
But I wouldn't expect you bitch ass niggas to get it
Fuck with us, or get fucked over nigga
R.H.Q for life
Ya BITCH!
