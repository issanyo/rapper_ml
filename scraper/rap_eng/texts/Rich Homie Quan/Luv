[Intro: Rich Homie Quan]
Rich Homie baby
Jackboy, tell me how you feel 'bout that girl bro
Man that nigga love, man

[Chorus: Jackboy & Rich Homie Quan]
I just want your love (I just want your love)
Baby I just want your loh-oh-ove (I just want your love)
Know you think I'm not the one 'cause the place that I'm from is too fuckin' slum, ayy
I'm not askin' for much (I'm not askin' for much)
Girl I'm not askin' for mu-uh-ch (I'm not askin' for much)
Just wanna build trust, why you be so tough, tighten down, loosen up (loosen up baby)
Said girl hold me down (gotta hold me down, yeah yeah)
Said girl hold me do-oh-own (gotta hold me down)

[Verse 1: Jackboy]
Girl hold me down 'til I'm back in your town
'Cause when I'm around I put smile to your frown
Took your dog to the pound
Don't know love, she show how
I don't wanna wait, need affection right now
Made her a model, took her out McDonalds
Now we pop bottles of lean, no Moscato
No better feelin', like I won the lotto
No better feelin', 'cause this do high notes
Oh-oh-oh, go slow-oh-oh
Don't fo-oh-old, just play your role
Don't wanna buy love, wanna build and grow
Want your love now, not just when I blow
Really got your heart if you love me while I'm broke
Certified sniper, I got you in my scope
Certified sniper, I got you in my scope, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Jackboy & Rich Homie Quan]
I just want your love (I just want your love)
Baby I just want your loh-oh-ove (I just want your love)
Know you think I'm not the one 'cause the place that I'm from is too fuckin' slum, ayy
I'm not askin' for much (I'm not askin' for much)
Girl I'm not askin' for mu-uh-ch (I'm not askin' for much)
Just wanna build trust, why you be so tough, tighten down, loosen up (loosen up baby)
Said girl hold me down (girl hold me down, baby just please hold me down, hold me down)
Said girl hold me do-oh-own (please hold me down, ayy)

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Girl hold me down like that weight on your shoulders
Solitary rocks in her ear, they look like boulders
Learned the game by myself, ain't nobody to coach us
Turn the lights on, niggas scatter like the roaches
We ain't have cable growin' up but now we got it
Now we cash out on every car, don't do deposits
Shoppin' shoppin', goin' crazy, left the mall ballin' ballin'
I ain't trippin', we ain't crazy
305, we at Ball Harbor goin' brazy
Red and blue flag, I gotta shoutout to them Haitians
Kodak keep your head up, Jackboy relay it
The message, yeah that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
No flat shit, no actually, I'm on 1800 ugly corner babe
Jackboy tell 'em

[Chorus: Jackboy & Rich Homie Quan]
Baby I just want your loh-oh-ove
Know you think I'm not the one 'cause the place that I'm from is too fuckin' slum, ayy
I'm not askin' for much
Girl I'm not askin' for mu-uh-ch (I'm not askin' for much)
Just wanna build trust, why you be so tough, tighten down, loosen up (baby girl)
Said girl hold me down (baby girl loosen up)
Said girl hold me do-oh-own (just hold me down)

[Outro: Rich Homie Quan]
Yeah, pull up with you and them hoes hate
We ain't gotta be together, I know you my soulmate
Baby got a problem, better tell 'em your nigga name hold weight
I ain't never worried 'bout no nigga I swear
Crazy all on three stripe, bae I'll take you there, yeah
(crazy all on three stripe, bae I'll take you there)
Ayy look Jackboy, this what I wanna tell you from me, right
Talk to 'em Quan, let 'em know the real bro
You 'posed to been got in bro, on God
I was so busy and um, I had other people runnin' my IG at the time
And I don't think you understood
And that's why I wanted to bless you with a good song
Rich Homie
