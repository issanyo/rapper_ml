[Intro]
Drapped up, dripped out, you know what I'm talking about
You know how I feel about you, shorty, when we grind out
Drapped up, dripped out, you know what I'm talking about
You know how I feel about you, shorty, when we grind out

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
I'm out here on it now, 'cause time don't stop
You know I gotta hit the streets, beat up the block
Yep, until they listening, with you as my rock
I'm focused, got my head in, Rolexs and 11's
Stay grinding, mane, that paper chase
Hustling to see my family good, ya mama straight
Nigga, money over everything, so when they hate
Rolexs and 11's, hot box it in my 7

[Hook: Jacquees]
Ain't nobody got me like you do
My partners be like, "That's your soldier, your lil soldier"
That's why I'm riding out with you
I'll always be like, "That's my soldier, my lil soldier"
She hold it down and I pick it up
We balling, like an armored truck
Ain't nobody got me like you do
I'll always be like, "That's my soldier, my lil, lil soldier"

[Verse 2: Jacquees]
It's hard to see the real, girls come and go
Draw you into they fantasies before you know it
Eyes out for my enemies, I clear my throat
With plans to have a wedding, Rolexes and 11's
I never have to search, your always there
My shortys always down to grind and she's sincere
I vow to give the world to world to her
Deserve to give the world to world to her

[Hook: Jacquees]
Ain't nobody got me like you do
My partners be like, "That's your soldier, your lil soldier"
That's why I'm riding out with you
I'll always be like, "That's my soldier, my lil soldier"
She hold it down and I pick it up
We balling, like an armored truck
Ain't nobody got me like you do
I'll always be like, "That's my soldier, my lil soldier, girl"

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
30 dollars every minute, that's a Rolex (Presidential)
It's my lil soldier, I'm lieutenant, and you don't wanna go there
So there, balling on a nigga like
No hell, ball lil Gucci guy
Four pound, kick back top floor
Your ho there, your ho there
I ain't tryna be rude
Better let her do what you taught her
Fuck yo' principal, I break rules
Got a bitch, say she fell in love with Quan
Got my waist wide, you can hold a gun
I'm a soldier, a nigga lil soldier
If I shoot, y'all niggas gon' run
I told you that I ain't know you
Me and Jacquees got another one
The bitches gon' love this here
I done switched cars, I'm in my other one
I'mma try to make a mil this year
What ya wanna do right now?
Who you wanna screw right now?
Flow sick, got a flu right now
Pay attention, Jacquees, talk to 'em, young nigga

[Hook: Jacquees]
Ain't nobody got me like you do
My partners be like, "That's your soldier, your lil soldier"
That's why I'm riding out with you
I'll always be like, "That's my soldier, my lil soldier"
She hold it down and I pick it up
We balling, like an armored truck
Ain't nobody got me like you do
I'll always be like, "That's my soldier, my lil soldier, girl"
