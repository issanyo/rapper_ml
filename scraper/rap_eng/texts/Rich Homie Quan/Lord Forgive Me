[Hook]
Pull up in a brand new Bentley drop top and I got 4 hoes with me
Everybody know the A7 Audi that I drive got little bit of gold in it
Leave a nigga dead on the beat got a nigga feelin' just like a mortician
I ain't saying that I'm perfect, I know I sin everyday, all I ask is Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
If I can't make it at the church every Sunday just understand
Lord forgive me
If I'm pressured to kill a nigga hope you see where I'm comin' from and listen what I'm sayin'
Lord forgive me
I know I'm not married but I'm fuckin' these bitches every city I go
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me (Amen, Amen)

[Verse 1]
If I make a couple of mistakes
I ain't sayin I'm perfect or great, Lord
Going fishin' shawty you the bait
Ain't no competition you bae
And I just wanna know if I could dive in the pussy, go down on the pussy, head dive first
Got your legs wide open
Destiny's child make you say my name
Versace everything even my sheets too
Get the knees black even me too
I might eat that pussy like Kiku
Baby I just wanna meet and greet you
And I'm in love with your beauty like a beast too and she told me she don't even eat seafood
Made her eat this dick then told her open her mouth what we call that? Yeah we call it see food
Lord please forgive me
If I have to send one of these niggas to you, Lord please forgive me
I'ma hurt they feelings when I get that brand new car and do work nigga

[Verse 2]
Listen up, I'ma say a lil' prayer and it goes like this (Lord)
I know I did a lot of fucked up shit I know I ain't supposed to cuss but I'ma say (Lord Forgive Me)
Please please (Lord Forgive Me)
I know I fucked up listen (Lord)
I done fucked up man (Forgive Me)
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
That got me through jail when I was locked up
Keep your eyes on snakes they'll bite ya
Grind hard, this shit don't come over night bruh
I don't need a pistol nigga I'll fight y'all
In my closet, more shoes than flight club
Ride deep on the beat like a bike club
Sleep all day, all night uh
I done did a lot of fucked up shit
I just pray God forgive me
I done did shit I ain't thought about
God forgive me promise I'ma be a better person
I seem to only pray when its an emergency (Why?)
Told 'em 'cause the beat like surgery (Why?)
A lot of y'all fuck niggas talkin'
I remember I was walkin', told 'em what I'm doin' now
