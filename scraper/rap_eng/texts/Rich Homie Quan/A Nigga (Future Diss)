[Hook]
I ain’t met a nigga yet fucking with my pimpin'
And I ain’t met a nigga yet who could fuck my bitch
But if I run into that nigga I'm gon' let you know
But if I run into that nigga I'm gon' let you know
I swear ain’t meet that nigga yet
I swear I ain’t meet that nigga yet, thats on my mama
Thats on my mama, I ain't meet that nigga yet

[Verse 1]
1989, peace shout out to Tammy
Nigga that’s my mama, if you ain't know that's who raised me
I was in the school, breaking rules, misbehaving
Shout out to little dude, that nephew, he in training
Now I'm in the coupe with that swoop and she takin'
Dick in her mouth, like them beans got a baby
Brother still got to work daily, gotta thank the lord still on my knees praying
My little sister crazy ooh ooh ooh I ask the lord to forgive me every day I sin
Gotta watch these fuck niggas, the more money the more crazy it get
Gotta keep that yacht running, this pimp shit a heavy expense

[Hook]
I ain’t met a nigga yet fucking with my pimpin'
And I ain’t met a nigga yet who could fuck my bitch
But if I run into that nigga I'm gon' let you know
But if I run into that nigga I'm gon' let you know
I swear ain’t meet that nigga yet
I swear I ain’t meet that nigga yet, thats on my mama
Thats on my mama, I ain't meet that nigga yet

[Verse 2]
I'm back like the future nigga
Quan you the future boy
Don't confuse me with Future nigga
Ohh, Pockets fat, Rasputia, nigga

The coolest in the room
Make the neighbors feel it under us
We coming up, cause nigga coming from nothing bro
No assumptions cause everybody go their own trick
One kingdom, one crown, one king, one queen, one prince, one princess, one sire, no fences, no pride, no grudges, no nuts, no glory
And I'm beatin' my chest sayin'

[Hook]
I ain’t met a nigga yet fucking with my pimpin'
And I ain’t met a nigga yet who could fuck my bitch
But if I run into that nigga I'm gon' let you know
But if I run into that nigga I'm gon' let you know
I swear ain’t meet that nigga yet
I swear I ain’t meet that nigga yet, thats on my mama
Thats on my mama, I ain't meet that nigga yet
