[Intro]
30 you a fool for this one

[Chorus]
I can’t go back to livin’ how I was livin’ (no, no)
Say I can’t go back to feelin’ how I was feelin’ (hell nah)
When I was lil’ never dreamed of havin’ these millions (that right too)
I watch my momma, she struggled, I wanted different (I watch my momma nigga)
I love my kids like my daddy had loved me (I love my kids nigga)
I show 'em different from what they had showed me (I show 'em different)
That pain is deep in my veins and it goin’ deep (just like a ocean)
That pain is deep in my veins and it goin’ deep

[Verse 1]
Roadblock intersection, I'm just tryna go around it
30 thousand, Plain Jane, nah them not normal problems (nah)
Make the money, stay the same (money), house in another county (Quan)
Bitch in a different league (rich homie), kinda crazy how it's goin'
I went wrong when I made my first million, start out the stu
Gotta keep a toolie in Atlanta like this shit a action movie
And it be feelin' like a movie when I'm hoppin' out that Benz
This bih actin' bad and bougie, so I hopped down on her friend
Hit the top down show her skin, got these niggas goin' gray
Might buy some palm trees 'cause these niggas throwin' shade
Give that .44 tool a spin while I'm listenin' to the O'Jays
I made an oath and told myself no more broke days

[Chorus]
I can’t go back to livin’ how I was livin’ (no, no)
Say I can’t go back to feelin’ how I was feelin’ (hell nah)
When I was lil’ never dreamed of havin’ these millions (that right too)
I watch my momma, she struggled, I wanted different (I watch my momma nigga)
I love my kids like my daddy had loved me (I love my kids nigga)
I show 'em different from what they had showed me (I show 'em different)
That pain is deep in my veins and it goin’ deep (just like a ocean)
That pain is deep in my veins and it goin’ deep

[Verse 2]
Cartier a couple thousand, now I got a better vision
Down bad growin' up, we ain't have a television
I was broke growin' up, I ain't even care to fix it
I told myself gotta make this workout just like LA Fitness
They was trippin' so I had to buy it, I couldn’t rent it
I know the difference, boy I know you lyin', you not wit it
Remember back in the day, everything was all goodie
Air Force 1s, some Girbauds and a Sean John hoodie
I look hard dropped a quarter million on a set of keys
When I bought it yeah that Bentley did something to my self esteem
I look my bitch dead in her eyes, said, "I won’t play 'bout you"
I can’t go back to being broke, that’ll be like deja vu, nigga

[Chorus]
I can’t go back to livin’ how I was livin’ (no, no)
Say I can’t go back to feelin’ how I was feelin’ (hell nah)
When I was lil’ never dreamed of havin’ these millions (that right too)
I watch my momma, she struggled, I wanted different (I watch my momma nigga)
I love my kids like my daddy had loved me (I love my kids nigga)
I show 'em different from what they had showed me (I show 'em different)
That pain is deep in my veins and it goin’ deep (just like a ocean)
That pain is deep in my veins and it goin’ deep

30 you a fool for this one
