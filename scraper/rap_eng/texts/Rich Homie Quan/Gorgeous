[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
She got a cute little shape when she smile I see dimples
Don't wanna see you cry when I make you smile like tryna pimp ya
We contemplate each other like a frame and a picture
She say she want my last name not the middle
She wanna suck Rich Homie, fuck Rich Homie
I'm a real homie baby and get started real homie
Bitches love Rich Homie, niggas hate Rich Homie
I'm so rich homie, I'm gon' stay rich homie (for life)

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
My shirt rich homie
I pay myself in other words I work for Rich Homie
That bitch came in with you and yea she flirtin' with Rich Homie
Niggas in different cliques wanna convert to Rich Homie
I'm so rich homie, baby
Fast lane racing goin' top speed
Top guard we ain't blowing, while she topping me
Glock cocked four shots [?] on police
Get knocked off and Imma lay low for bout a week
But back to the bitch I fell in love with
She held me down when I woke broke
Can't [?] above it
Don't tell my business to the public (never)
I love you girl, I know you love that
