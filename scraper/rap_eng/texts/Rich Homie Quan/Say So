Trauma Tone Time.Rich Homie Baby!

[Hook]
I got this thick bitch booty do anything I say
My small,slim chick be trippin bout anything  but don't play
About her nigga,bout them figures,in her purse,she keep her pistol
Day time job,at night she Strippin
Turn around plug,best believe she gon hit me
I'ma be like ayo(hey,hey).Them choppas screamin like ayo(fo,fo)
And she'll do anything that a nigga say so(she will nigga)
Turn around plug for the work best believe I'ma pull up
One of ya'll niggas gon have to make up
Verse 1:
Shootin all of ya'll niggas
She won't Molly,she want Scotties
And I'm boottin all of these bitches(boot up)
Heard that 12 got behind me watch how fast I lose these niggas
They say that pistol like a lemon
I'm gon squeeze it then gon shoot it,aye
I don't want no boss nigga
I the boss already don't touch that shit
If I don't get it off of me
You don't see me with it don't mean no strap
Know I probably got it on me(my right hand)
And that V.I.P table i'm sittin in got a hunned bottles on it
Yeah,they got them Mollys on it
You ain't shoppin,she wearin I spent 600 on it
You don't know how the sack feel.You don't know about me
You don't know how it feel to have a bad bitch off on her knees just to swim in yo sea
I call her my nieces when we in public
But everybody know she my side chick
My wrist flickin colorful,this bitch i'm with gulable
