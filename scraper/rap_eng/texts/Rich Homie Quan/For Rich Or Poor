Ha ha ha ha If I could go all the way back
And change it all
I wouldn't
I came from the bottom for a reason nigga

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Jumped off the porch
Ien have nothing
When i was poor, they was laughing at me
Now I'm on them billboards, and I'm laughing at them
I give you my heart, you can have it baby
It was cool at first, it's been a little dramatic lately
Was me and you at first, it's been me and your family lately
Why throw my name in the dirt
I'm like what happened baby?
Make up sex make her hurt
Ride this saddle baby
Cuz them, No Muslim but it's 'Alaykum
Cause them, My cousins will get something taken
The oven baking, left the motherfucker on 350
I ain't counting Monday, feel like I been on the road for 350
Days nigga (aye)
I'm paid nigga (aye)
Ain't tell you bout the house that I got with
That Lake in the backyard nigga
Act hard nigga
I will pull your card nigga
Play, with me got some niggas who will
Lay on you
Where you stay?
Nigga I ain't playing 100 gran on your head nigga
Like a Jesus piece, Nah I ain't playing with you
If the bitch a freak, I ain't even laying with her
Used to hit licks just to make a couple bands nigga
(Aye, Aye) Talk a little louder
I ain't heard what you saying nigga
Did a couple walk-throughs

Leather jacket on
Yeah, I'm that nigga
I was born in the 80s like the crack nigga
Aye (8x)

[Verse 2]
Never heard of a atari, play games on 'em
Never drove in a Ferrari, switching lanes on them
Damien Wayans that's a shame on them
Big booty freak, lil bitch, tatted my name on it
I heard them niggas hating, ya'll the same on us
Since them niggas claim they hot
I set some flame on them
Real nigga. What youu thought?
We ain't  lame homies
Skinny jeans see the knot, and that thang on me
Bang Bang Pow
There go one of y'all niggas
If I aim at y'all I ain't missing you niggas
Creep in your house like Clause, I ain't using no chimney
Like the 24th of December
Ima make youu niggas remember
Them Christmas Eve's I ain't have shit, beginner
Them open mics they was laughing
Now I'm spending so much money
They ain't asking
No question bout my bitch
'Cause she the baddest
I be on the road
Yeah I seen a lot of hoes
At the end of every rainbow is there a pot of gold
Wanna hold you in my hand, want you under my control
Foresighting  the city girl I wanna tear the globe
Ran off my money now I'm tryna get some mo
Bands to the ceiling, yeah we stacked it from the flo'
And we got some more up in the walls
Some more behind the pictures
Over the hot fire plate
Behind the Lord
I ain't like the call
Empire he was out
Referee that's a foul
Got a technical 'cause of hard a nigga ball
TMZ all in my business 'cause I fall

Born in October, weigh it on my scale

Rich Homie Baby
