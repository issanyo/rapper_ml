I'm riding that new school, Your shit outdated
Talking bout 40, I spent that shit on my baby
Cuban link er'thang, Cuban link er'thang
Cuban link er'thang, Cuban link, Cuban link
Fell off and bounce back and I'm right back in it

We them new young niggas, young niggas
And we counting up millions
We them new young niggas, young niggas
(Young Scooter)

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I got out of jail, went straight to the bricks
I got rap money, you can't tell me shit
I got chill money, I can buy yo bitch
New hundreds, all blue but I ain't Crip
New Benz Coupe, All white like bricks
I stay kickin' boss shit
Homie Quan, Thugga Thugga, Scooter, yeah, we runnin' shit
$20,000 for a show without the radio (free bandz)
16-5 prices lower than Shawty Lo (EMG)
I finesse on every beat with that cocaine flow (finesse)
Young niggas came a long way from that corner store (young nigga)
I out sell bricks when I remix and put 'em back together
The streets fell apart, I had to put 'em up together
We them new yung niggas, dumb niggas
Take over run niggas
Driving 15 whips, we pre order, how you ride, Quan?

[Verse 2: Rich Homie & Young Thug]
I spent like 15 on my bitch
I spent like 15 on this watch
I got way more than 15 haters
I keep like 15 in that Glock
When I was like 15, I got robbed
I done spent like 15 on your broads
So they don't make a young nigga
Pull up with the door lifting
It's an amber alert
Cause I got a nigga girl missing
Pull up with a bankroll (rope ban nigga)
Talk shit, I ain't think so
Gettin' money, I'mma send it when the bank closed
I don't need a lawyer, nigga cause the case closed
Who ya walking' round with?
20 thousand dollars In that pocket for me
40 thousand dollars put it up for lil' boy to go to school
Thugga comin' right back on the block good crack
Thugga thugga think you knew so act like ya knew that
I'mma paint yo picture baby you can call me cook that
It's bout that cash, I'm pullin' up, thunder techs
I want bricks and I don't want no order
I'm the YSL boss, whacha know bout thugga?
These fake bangers, they gon' end up suffering
I hope he ain't the feds, but he got birds for a quarter
