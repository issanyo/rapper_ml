[Hook]
Goose got another one
Bought a new coupe, not the other one
Got a new roof, cut off my other one (what)
Need Louis shoes, not the other ones
Shout out to Goose, he got another one
What you tryna do? You workin' the other one
I need 'em by the two, I need another one
... got two, I need another one
