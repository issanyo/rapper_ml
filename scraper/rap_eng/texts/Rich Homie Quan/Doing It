[Verse:]
I got things about you that I can't put my finger on it
And I gotta keep her crowded, cuz I hate to see her lonely
I'm tryna love her for a life time, I can't love that girl for a moment
And I done broke so many swears, I canâ€™t break this promise, For you
For you I gotta stay true
I can't even do that old like old shit I used to do
I want you to hold dick down like you supposed to
If you sick I got soup, ride this dick like a coop, only got room two
I got bitches who do whatever I tell 'em to do
I got niggas who shoot whatever I tell them to shoot
Been on so many downers, nigga I need some boost
Take me up to the moon, something 'bout your mouth

[Hook:]
Cuz I love that thang you do with your tongue when you do it, baby
I love that thang you do with your tongue when you do it, baby
I love that thang you do with your always move it, baby
I say I love that thing you do, it's always when you move it, baby

[Outro:]
And you doin' it
You doin' it, you doin' it
Uh, just keep doin' it
Keep doin' it, keep doin' it
What you doin', you doin' it
What you do, just keep doin' it
What you do, you doin' it
