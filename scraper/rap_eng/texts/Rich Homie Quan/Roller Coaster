[Intro: Rich Homie Quan]
Rich Homie baby, yeah you know its me
I keep her feet dangling
Rollercoaster ride
But keep in mind if she broke
Thats alot of fixing
I'd be your batman, if it mean me Gotham city

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
First ill just take the time, cause I would like to
I'd love to take you out
So let me invite you
I see the moon every time I look you in your eyes
What's a teddy bear if you already a prize
Close your eyes, take in the fairy tale
Kiss you on the merry go but I will never tell
And when it's farewell
I'll miss you
Thicker than a snicker girl I'm tryina hit you
Bumper cars
We just switching lanes we ain't going far
Now we on the ground and we going hard
Turbulence, got the whole ground shaking
When I'm done, I'll let you enjoy I'm patient

[Chorus: Jacquees]
You must be this tall to ride this ride
You don't need to make up girl
Not this time
You got your heels on, we'll take them off
Skip the line now but don't get caught
I'm tryina pick you up, up, up, up, up, up
Like I like I know how, know how
But if we go up, up, up, up, up
It feels like it goes down
Welcome to my rollercoaster
Up, up, down, down
I just wanna roller coast ya
Up, up, down, down, down, down

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
I told jacquees to talk to em like he at the podium
She go up and down call her acrophobia
Can't drown in that water so I'm back stroking her
In that monster plantation, we on the boat rolling up
That lean taste like cotton candy and easter pink
You know my engine loud, scream machine
Long nights, I remember
Jumping lines at the ninja
On that mind bender, cause I see something in you
And I had to stay down for the come up, up, up
It's déjà vu when I tell you
They wanna be us, us, trust
Me when I tell you I swear to god im tired of this
Jacquees whats that height requirment

[Chorus: Jacquees]
You must be this tall to ride this ride
You don't need to make up girl
Not this time
You got your heels on, we'll take them off
Skip the line now but don't get caught
I'm tryina pick you up, up, up, up, up, up
Like I like I know how, know how
But if we go up, up, up, up, up
It feels like it goes down
Welcome to my rollercoaster
Up, up, down, down
I just wanna roller coast ya
Up, up, down, down, down, down
I just wanna roller coast ya
Up, up, down, down, down, down

[Verse 3: Jacquees]
Ok when it's over, let your hair down
You know I'm the champion of the stare down
We're taking the stares down, through the hall of fame
I'll let you assist me like it's a ball game
I'm calling you all names, first, middle, last
I'ma take you on my ferris wheel baby the slow effect
I love you when we're up, when we're down
Some of my ways are twisted but I'll come around

[Chorus: Jacquees]
You must be this tall to ride this ride
You don't need to make up girl
Not this time
You got your heels off, we'll take them off
Skip the line now but don't get caught
I'm tryina pick you up, up, up, up, up, up
Like I like I know how, know how
But if we go up, up, up, up, up
It feels like it goes down
Welcome to my rollercoaster
Up, up, down, down
I just wanna roller coast ya
Up, up, down, down, down, down
I just wanna roller coast ya
Up, up, down, down, down, down
