[Rich Homie Quan Talking:]
Despite how much money I get
Or how much I make off this shit
I still watch them bitches man
Them bitches slimy bro
To all my young niggas
Don't trust these hoes, man

[Verse 1:]
Quan tell them how these hoes bang
You might like me for who I am
In love with my money you just want me cause of what I got
I heard them niggas was lurking on me
So you know the homie had to get'on up in the spot
I spent so long at the bottom took a elevator to the top
4,5 a.m. riding 'round with the muthafuckin' top
Police pulled me over cause he said I need a bra
Cause I'm riding 'round topless
New car, new wheel , new brain, new bitch, good brain
She even go to school
Big chopper, big aim
Make that thing shit stain now I got his ass looking like a fool
I won't even be ashamed if a nigga catch me slipping
Cause I know it ain't shit that I can do

[Hook]

Nigga ion hear nothing (no no no)
I'm tryna be the best at what I do

[Verse 2]
We done came a long way from Section 8
Used to be ramen noodles now pepper steak
Pull up on you with that ruger y'all face the fate
I'm a real nigga, but fake is fake
Call me Picasso, I might paint her face
I need some headphones cause they screaming so loud
I'm beatin' it up, where is Dr. Dre?
Think you ran off with my money
I got Petey on the corner and you know he got that choppa waiting
Bitch ass nigga got a lot to say
I love my lawyer,  she win all my cases
All my watches got frosted flakes
I heard he want to be me so I brought [?]
Fuck a new boot I got lots of papers in my pocket (they watching)
I never bring sand to the beach
Your ho got her hands on me
