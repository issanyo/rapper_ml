[Intro]
(Rich homie)
I ain't never felt like this (Quan)
I ain't never felt like this
I ain't never felt like this
I ain't never felt like this
I ain't never felt, I ain't never felt
I ain't never felt like this

[Hook]
I feel like biggie when he got his first check
I'm feeling like Big Meech when he fucked up the whole A
I'm in love with too much money to find me a soul mate
I feel like I'm 2Pac cause my set be on the way
I throw up them W's no W that's where we stay
From Inglewood up to [?] I'm good wherever I'm at
Blow torch that fence I had dropped it and told the police suck my dick
And got away then I bought that bitch a Birkin bag and told that hoe to get out of my face

[Verse 1]
I (don't do what) don't condone the violence
I count it on what Miley Cyrus
I got nothing but codeine all in my body
I want her to get on top of me and ride me like a Harley
I wanted to be rich, I couldn't get that shit, I couldn't get that shit so
I had to make my own way by myself, I had to make a own name by myself
I couldn't get rich, I didn't have shit, I didn't have enough so I did what I did
Went to jail, did my biz
Came home, I took off, I took off

[Hook]
I feel like biggie when he got his first check
I'm feeling like Big Meech when he fucked up the whole A
I'm in love with too much money to find me a soul mate
I feel like I'm 2Pac cause my set be on the way
I throw up them W's no W that's where we stay
From Inglewood up to [?] I'm good wherever I'm at
Blow torch that fence I had dropped it and told the police suck my dick
And got away then I bought that bitch a Birkin bag and told that hoe to get out of my face

[Verse 2]
I don't know why I feel like this
Purple mack lipstick all on my dick
Hit it from the side legs up don't try to look at my wrist
Is that a rollie, Yeah
Hit it from the back while I do the Rich Homie dance
I'm chillin on this yacht with a hundred thousand in my pants
I can still whip it in the pot nigga I be still poppin xans
Who the fuck gone stop the man
I can end a motherfucking nigga life like a doctor can
But I didn't know I was gone be this rich, I had to take some X cause I didn't know I would be this rich
But I got too much invested plus I'm a [?]
I feel like Michael Jordan when he played with the 98 Bulls

[Hook]
I feel like biggie when he got his first check

I'm in love with too much money to find me a soul mate

I throw up them W's no W that's where we stay
From Inglewood up to [?] I'm good wherever I'm at
Blow torch that fence I had dropped it and told the police suck my dick
