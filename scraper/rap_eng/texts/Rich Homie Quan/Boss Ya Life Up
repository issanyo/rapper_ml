[Intro: Yung Bleu]
Got twenty cars, I don't know which one to drive

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
Got twenty cars, I don't know which one to drive
Got twenty friends, I don't know which one gon' ride
I put that pressure on my back, I'm livin' life
I'm that young nigga from the streets, I'm goin' live
Boss your life up nigga, boss your life up
Boss your life up nigga, boss your life up
Boss your life up nigga, boss your life up
Boss your life up nigga, boss your life up

[Verse 1: Yung Bleu]
Money out the A-hole, stack them blocks like lego
I ran up some bands, she gon' fuck me for this fame ho
I blew out the brains, twenty thousand in my chain though
Trappin' in the rain, we gon' bust you like a mango
I turned myself into a boss, I'm makin' boss moves
I put my state up on my back so they gon' know you
Ain't need nobody to put me on, I already had the juice
I took my fam up out the hood, that's what I had to do
You got some hitters on your team, is they gon' die with you?
Ain't nothin' but family in my clique, they open fire for Bleu
I got a deal, I kept it real, ain't sell my soul for this
Thirty-two thousand on my neck, I'm goin' all over this, yeah

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
Got twenty cars, I don't know which one to drive
Got twenty friends, I don't know which one gon' ride
I put that pressure on my back, I'm livin' life
I'm that young nigga from the streets, I'm goin' live
Boss your life up nigga, boss your life up
Boss your life up nigga, boss your life up
Boss your life up nigga, boss your life up
Boss your life up nigga, boss your life up

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
I had to boss up my life, had to cut off my friends
I had to rebound my circle 'cause them niggas pretend
I had to sacrifice the Honda just to get me a Benz
And then I asked lord forgive me 'cause I know that I sinned
But lately, I been wearin' polo tees and they don't cost enough
Life was kind of average 'til I bossed it up
Gucci fabric me, put that Lacoste up
And he can't join the team because the roster full
Got a bitch off in the pen, I just be talkin' to her
I make that call, all them stars, on my way, walkin' to it
I got these hoes smuggling drugs like they Boston George
I done lost count of how many cars in my car garage

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
Got twenty cars, I don't know which one to drive
Got twenty friends, I don't know which one gon' ride
I put that pressure on my back, I'm livin' life
I'm that young nigga from the streets, I'm goin' live
Boss your life up nigga, boss your life up
Boss your life up nigga, boss your life up
Boss your life up nigga, boss your life up
Boss your life up nigga, boss your life up

[Verse 3: Yung Bleu]
I'm on an island on vacation, I'm a star now
Bitch I got choices, I got different color cars now
Plus I'm my oldest, get too close, you know I'm drawing down
All of my people fuck with Jacque, you know it's goin' down
Twenty-two thousand on my wrist, bitch it's a Hublot
Purple stuff out a double cup, it make me move slow
You gon' be big, you play your cards right like Uno
Gucci on me now, snap a photo
I be fuckin' different hoes, I be rockin' different clothes
Ballin' like the super bowl, my Audemar super cold
Rollie presidential, whoa, go check my credentials, whoa
Jigging with a pistol, whoa, you gon' make me hit you up

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
Got twenty cars, I don't know which one to drive
Got twenty friends, I don't know which one gon' ride
I put that pressure on my back, I'm livin' life
I'm that young nigga from the streets, I'm goin' live
Boss your life up nigga, boss your life up
Boss your life up nigga, boss your life up
Boss your life up nigga, boss your life up
Boss your life up nigga, boss your life up
