[Intro]
Tryna change, but I can't
Everything's the same
Yea Yea Yea

[Chorus]
Gotta switch up
Can't do everything the same
That money bring you power
Can't switch up won't change
I don't respect no coward
But I go hard for my name
Niggas saying I changed up
But my number still the same
My address still the same
My mama still the same
And I still go to my grandma house
Nigga ain't a damn thing Changed
Everything the same
I ain't did nothing different
I swear everything's the same
Everything's the same (x7)

[Rich homie - Verse 1]
Late night trapping
Ain't nothing changed
Big ball capping
Don't trust her
Shawty play games
Heard your boy trapping
And my number still the same
Still pulling up on my side bitch
Still lying to my main
And I promise Ima keep it 100
With you baby
If you promise me
You gone stay the same
And my bank account got commas
My safe filled with them new 100's
I swear to God
I can't never change
You telling false allegations
I want her mouth
Swallow babies
I'm still the same
Niggas changing
Once I got fame
Niggas hated
I want some money boy
I want the business
You fuck up a check
You gone learn to respect it
Fuck your O.G boy
I make him respect me
But I'm still the same
Man ain't nothing bout me different

[Chorus]

[B La B - Verse]
Made it to the top
And I'm still on the block
Serving J's in my Jay's
Ain't nothing changed
Everything still the same
Got the same young niggas
That'll peel your fucking top
For a little bit of nothing
Her body
Her slang
Everybody rushing
Quarterback in the bayfield
I heard these niggas rushing
You can never say I'm hiding
You know where my hood at
Me and Homie sliding
Groceries where the hood at?
Ha! We on the same shit
We get high
And fuck your main bitch
Never switching
We with the same clique
You keep clapping
We let them things click

[Chorus]
