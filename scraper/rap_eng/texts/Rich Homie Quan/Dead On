[Intro: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
Hey....
LONDON ON DA TRACK, BITCH!
O ohh... Hey... Ohh... Aye!

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I fucked her quick and fast
Then I went to bed on em
Lil shawty got a phat ass
And some good lil head on her
And they talk behind my back
Because I know they scared of me
Yo aim off my nigga
But my shit be dead on
Dead on, dead on, dead on
Dead on, dead on, dead on
Ran up on no country nigga
Boy I'm dead wrong
Aiming at these fuck niggas
Boy you know I'm dead on
Dead on, dead on, dead on

[Verse1: Young Thug]
Pfftsshh!
I'm playing dead but I'm dead on ya
You not a blood but you got red on ya
And I watch my surroundings
Like the Feds on me
I just got me some pints on a plane
I feel like I'm alien
Man I'm so high up
I'm higher than every alien
Went from open mic to performing in the stadiums
Now all my shoes, they sponsored by Margiela Maison and them..
Now I feel like I'm high up in the air
I got your baby shaking like a hit stick inside a ?

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I fucked her quick and fast
Then I went to bed on em
Lil shawty got a phat ass
And some good lil head on her
And they talk behind my back
Because I know they scared of me
Yo I ain't off my nigga
My shit be dead on
Dead on, dead on, dead on
Dead on, dead on, dead on
Ran up on no country nigga
Boy I'm dead wrong
Aiming at these fuck niggas
Boy you know I'm dead on
Dead on, dead on, dead on

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
At 17, I caught me a felony
Influenced by the movie Belly
I got on all black just like a reverend
These niggas act like Tyler Perry
I swear
I'm geeked up off these medics
So if you try
Then yo ass better be ready
Cause I swear to god
I'll blow one of you niggas and not even think about it
If that is yo main hoe don't bring her round me
I was lost in the Majors then somebody found me
Money for rainy days, I can't go with out it
Nigga don't talk no shit if you not about it
My nigga move O's, ain't talking Audis!
Bitches take off their clothes just to stand by me
Got a pocket full of stones
Tryna get off em
And I wanted to do a song but you sound awful
I'm way gone, swear I'm ?

Yo I ain't off my nigga
My shit be dead on
Dead on, dead on, dead on
Dead on, dead on, dead on
Ran up on no country nigga
Boy I'm dead wrong
Aiming at these fuck niggas
Boy you know I'm dead on
Dead on, dead on, dead on
