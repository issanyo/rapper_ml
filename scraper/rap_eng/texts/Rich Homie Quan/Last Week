Last week made 40,000 worth some feature deal
A week 50,000 worth of show
Last week spent 40,000 on two kilo deal
A week 50,000 worth of clothes
30,000 sick minutes, that’s a rolling’
Heard that story in the hood, you can go there
Hear I’m important and I’m good balling, know that

[Verse 1]
Every weekend five shows, that’s 50K
We eating, already know, I need 50 plates
And we beefing till the motor runs like 50 states
And ho freaky ‘
I ain’t lying, I’mma eat her up’
Baby old school in an old school, my new bitch, she old news
Im turnt up like Goku I’m super Saiyan, it’s air, air, like real grind
I flip that, I’m on Instagram and I’m flexin’ 2 000 likes in 10 minutes
And I’m like who did it, that’s a private number, who eat this
It’s the alimony, I’m pimping and I’m riding on, let me skin this
I think I made like 90,000 thousand last week
‘and I be damned if a nigga come up short
‘Cause he lit up like that torch, he turn livid

[Verse 2]
Still going in, got me up’way before that I was drunk

And if you owe me, pay up ’cause’ this ain't no playstation
So please don’t play with me

Young niggas out here whiling, if you need it I get you straight
Young niggas out here childish’

Swear they playing, talking Hollywood with me, nigga
And I am spending on my son’
