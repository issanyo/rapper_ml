[Chorus:]
Pull up in something looking like a ghost
I wipe that lil pussy just like her nose
I keep her flexing let her drive the Rolls
I quick fuck her cause I gotta go
She know I want that money want that dough
I be high baby keep it on the low
All your Louie V luggage girl I would tote
Since you stayed down had to make this one for you

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
I be shittin on niggas I need a pamper
Shout out all my DJs rest in peace to Nando
Shout out Florida shout out to Miami shout out to Orlando
And ain't one thing that a rich homie can't do
Fucking all you nigga hoes that's why you niggas mad
Like that HOV lane in Florida boy you need a pass
Drop back in that pocket and I throw my boy the pass
I don't need no running back he might fumble and make me mad
Stuff 500 thousand ones in a fucking trash bag
He threw a thousand in the club now that's something to laugh at
10 thousand for a juug I don't want it y'all  niggas can have that
I loved reading growing up and I love me some math class
She caught a Ã¼ber to my house but had to catch a cab back
So many rooms in my house I need me a lil nanny
She wanna do me I got wood for her like a ball bat
All this money that I got if I ain't rich what do you call that
I want that money that jewelry I want all that
If you ain't talking about money I'm gon ignore that
Ignore you you ain't talking about what you supposed to nigga
Pull up in a old school you snubbed me in high school so therefore I owe you
Mach 5 pull up the protools so I can go in on these niggas
Hold up wait so I can go in on these niggas

[Chorus:]
Pull up in something looking like a ghost
I wipe that lil pussy just like her nose
I keep her flexing let her drive the Rolls
I quick fuck her cause I gotta go
She know I want that money want that dough
I be high baby keep it on the low
All your Louie V luggage girl I would tote
Since you stayed down had to make this one for you

[Verse 2: Rich the Kid]
Shawty stayed down so I fuck with her
Bought that bitch a Mazi cost 250
I was counting up them bands they was sleeping on me
Magic City throw 100 me and Rich Homie
Rich nigga all in the Forbes fucking your bitch on the floor
2 milli for the tour ain't trusting bitches no more
I was capping, itching, fitching with Chanel shoes
I'm in love with the money I can't cheat on you
Tear it up get up in the pussy fuck it up
Bend over get wet 10 chains on my neck
Ima throw on that cum she gon choke gotta hit her in her throat
And I did this one for you Ima tell the truth
Riding round going crazy I done bought the coupe
Got a ceiling foreign thing looking for the roof
Riding down Melrose looking for the juice

[Chorus:]
Pull up in something looking like a ghost
I wipe that lil pussy just like her nose
I keep her flexing let her drive the Rolls
I quick fuck her cause I gotta go
She know I want that money want that dough
I be high baby keep it on the low
All your Louie V luggage girl I would tote
Since you stayed down had to make this one for you
