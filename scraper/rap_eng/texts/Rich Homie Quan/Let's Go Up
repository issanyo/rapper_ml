[Intro]
That Boy Cass

[Chorus]
Tonight baby let's go up
We some big players, we can call the shots
I might fishtail out the parking lot
Tonight baby let's go up
I told lil' shawty, "Play her part and keep it cool"
We gon' get this money, we ain’t got shit to do
Tonight baby let's go up
You got me stuck and babygirl I'm so in love
But I don’t want you to think I'm talkin' 'bout no drug
Tonight baby let's go up
Give me your heart and I promise I show you different
When I put my bitch on so she can get it
Tonight baby let's go up

[Verse 1]
I went up last night me and shawty did (shawty)
Got too drunk, fucked around and stayed at shawty crib (shawty)
You not no boss if you do not know them losses feel (losses)
No insurance, I pay cash on all my doctor bills (I did)
Gucci shirt, I do not know how Lacoste feel (Lacoste)
My stomach hurt, no more X, no I'm not poppin' pills (poppin')
One in the chamber, fire your ass up, how that rocket feel? (fa-fa-fa)
Like stone cold, I need a cold one, I might pop a beer (say what?)
I order steak, she order rice and plus the lobster tail (we did)
Take a day off, bae get a massage and go to [?]
I love this money, it ain’t hard to tell (okay)
Don’t be insecure, you got my heart as well

[Chorus]
Tonight baby let's go up
We some big players, we can call the shots
I might fishtail out the parking lot
Tonight baby let's go up
I told lil' shawty, "Play her part and keep it cool"
We gon' get this money, we ain’t got shit to do
Tonight baby let's go up
You got me stuck and babygirl I'm so in love
But I don’t want you to think I'm talkin' 'bout no drug
Tonight baby let's go up
Give me your heart and I promise I show you different
When I put my bitch on so she can get it
Tonight baby let's go up

[Verse 2]
Made some money, all my hoes say I don’t act the same (make some money)
Get some head while I'm on my way to the Falcons game (I'm on the way)
Regular nigga wit normal problems, I didn't ask for fame (no no)
He trigger happy, that lil' nigga ready to catch a stain
Run up on me, and I won't hestitate
Watch what I say, my case still open, they investigatin'
Got a Jesus Piece around my neck so I feel blessed today (amen)
Just learn from 'em, don't regret mistakes (that right too)
Might pull up to the hood and catch a play (okay)
If a nigga get wrong, I might catch a fade (what)
Tryna be wealthy, you know that's next to paid (rich homie baby)
Ain't gon be nothin' after us because we it nigga (okay)
Come kick it wit a rich nigga

[Chorus]
Tonight baby let's go up
We some big players, we can call the shots
I might fishtail out the parking lot
Tonight baby let's go up
I told lil' shawty, "Play her part and keep it cool"
We gon' get this money, we ain’t got shit to do
Tonight baby let's go up
You got me stuck and babygirl I'm so in love
But I don’t want you to think I'm talkin' 'bout no drug
Tonight baby let's go up
Give me your heart and I promise I show you different
When I put my bitch on so she can get it
Tonight baby let's go up
