[Intro]
Como te llamas?
That’s what my bitch said
I was like what?
Haha, me llamo Dequantes
You get it?

[Hook]
I got this Spanish ho I just met and I don’t know nothing she say
I got this bad little bitch from Georgia who’ll do anything for me
I got an iPhone full of hoes boy I got bitches for days
I know I know how to play, I know I got bitches who gone ride for me forever
I know I got niggas who gone die for me, no matter
The circumstances for me but I know they’ll do whatever
I know what it takes to be great, but I got to get better

[Verse 1]
This car here is foreign, top peeled off like an orange, bad bitch, yeah she know it
Tell that bitch I want her, if she don’t suck dick she boring, a nigga like me, I’m a warrior
Me and my ho got so many commas coming, both feel like bitches
I say it’s something bout the homie that she fell in love with
She said she don’t really even like niggas
If I get into it with a fuck nigga better believe she’ll ride, die, she’ll even fight with him
She’s like a girly girl, no diaper bitch, that’s right too
When it come down to her boy I go crazy
Every time I see her face it motivates me
In my dream I’m gone marry this ho, I ain’t playing
Even when she talking, I don’t understand what she saying
But I love her

[Verse 2]
I done did some shit that I ain’t proud about
I just bought a TEC, but I ain’t fouling out
Nick Carrey with your bitch, I got her wyling out
I go James Brown with your bitch, I’m black and proud of her
Ooh, I might buy her a little Audi car
That shit you smoking, ain’t loud enough
Fuck niggas stroking, I’m just laughing at em
She black with a little Spanish in her
She got a fat cat, I’m doing damage in it
If that girl wink then she gone fuck
OG Maco my partner, I got them bucks
If she on her period she got no choice but to suck
I don’t understand nothing she say, I don’t know where she from
