[Chorus]
I keep that lead on me like I got a test
For help, a cigarette I need one when I’m stressed
Still smoking weed to clear my mind and no more X
My bitch got mad when she found out I’m hittin my ex
I told my girl don’t try to change me
Been through so much I’m not the same me
Watchu expect when I been goin hard
We can’t keep going back and forth
Just need you to hold me down, is that too much to ask you for?

[Verse 1]
Only way to identify his body, is by the toe tag
And I put my bitch, I put my [?] to let my hoe brag
And I got some money that I ain’t touch get it out my hoe bag
4 bands I paid for this jacket, it’s on my coat tag
Ralph Lauren draws to hold my nuts, that’s where the dope at
And we keep that money in the circle like a cul de sac
We bust a u in the middle of the street and then we double [?]
I ain’t know that boy from a can of paint, I had to [?]
We robbed that boy, he had a gun but he ain’t buss it back
My bitch done cheated on me, so I don’t trust her ass

[Chorus]
I keep that lead on me like I got a test
For help, a cigarette I need one when I’m stressed
Still smoking weed to clear my mind and no more X
My bitch got mad when she found out I’m hittin my ex
I told my girl don’t try to change me
Been through so much I’m not the same me
Watchu expect when I been goin hard
We can’t keep going back and forth
Just need you to hold me down, is that too much to ask you for?
