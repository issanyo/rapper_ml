[Intro]
I do it all for you, you feel me?
I would say your name fuck butt
If I said it I know a lot of folks would get offended
But I love that smile you got on you

[Verse 1]
Hey, I got that sexy momma
Don't gon' do nothin' I say
My hoes ain't tellin' on her
Baby with me you safe
My cologne, you smell it on ya
She ain't even gotta see my face
That David Yamane on her, hey
I ain't tryna be rude, girl I'm tryna let you know I want you
And I ain't stand your ex girl
Don't tell me what he gon' do
Her wrist stay on flex
Yea I got me an AP too
And I ain't tryna get with you for sex girl
I ain't like them other dudes, dudes, dudes, dudes
I would never disrespect you or be rude, rude, ru-u-ude, ruuuude
I promise I will never, ever jeopardize losing you
I look past the fact that you cute
I wanna get to know the real you
Never lie to me, stay true
Is you ain't tryna lose, lose, lose, lose

[Hook]
Never make you frown, I'm gon' make you smile for me
I'ma make you smile for me
Everyday I'm gon' make you smile, smile, smile
Smile for me
I'm gonna make you smile for me
Smile everyday cause you 'posed to
Just because it Wednesday I might send you roses

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna make you smile
Never gonna make you cry
Might give you a child
If you promise you'll ride or die for me
Promise to have my back
Don't leave me stranded like four flat
I got my hand off on my gat
Cause I don't trust none of y'all niggas
Lookin' at my girl from the back
Y'all some lookin' ass niggas
I know you wanna but can't get her cause she mine
She don't even look at you, why waste her time?
Them shades she got on so dark you might think she blind (no Ray Charles)
She paid, what mine is hers, what hers is mine
I love her smile
I love the way she wear her hair
I love her unique style
Knew I was in love from the first time we went out
The first time we locked eyes
Around my feelin's you ain't hopin' it no disguise
Wanna walk you down the aisle
Wanna make your parents proud

[Hook]
Promise to never make you cry
Wanna make you smile for me
I'ma make you smile for me
Everyday I'm gon' make you smile, smile, smile
Smile for me
I'm gonna make you smile for me
Smile everyday cause you 'posed to
Just because it Wednesday I might send you roses

[Outro]
Smile, I wanna make you smile
I wanna make you smile
I wanna make you smile
Smile for me
I wanna make you smile for me
I'm gonna make you smile
I'm gonna make you smile for me, me, me, me
I'm gonna make you smile
Wanna see that pretty smile
For me, baby show your teeth, smile
Smile wide, smile wide, smile for me
I'm gonna make you smile for me
