[Hook]
All my diamonds look like water you would think I'm from Dubai
But all these guns I keep all on me you’d think I'm from the Chi
It’s a bird no it’s a plane, no those are bullets in the sky
I got money on your head, so boy you better be disguised
I got money on your head, I got money on your head
I got money on your head, like a fucking Jesus piece
I got money on your head, I got money on your head
I got money on your head, like a fucking Jesus piece

[Verse 1]
Money on your head if I want you dead
Them choppers bang like drums, no marching band
I got a hundred arms, a thousand hands
Everybody ride for Quan, fuck you saying
I don't want your molly, cause I don't trust your man
I can get you knocked off like a Russian can
I think he wired, I might bust his ass
Slice his throat, throw him in a river, hell
Fuck his ass
Shawty my companion, shawty she a rider
She say she got secrets, I promise to tell nobody
All my bitches are two nickles, dimes
You get it? All my rocks look like icicles, diamonds
You get it?

[Hook]
All my diamonds look like water you would think I'm from Dubai
But all these guns I keep all on me you’d think I'm from the Chi
It’s a bird no it’s a plane, no those are bullets in the sky
I got money on your head, so boy you better be disguised
I got money on your head, I got money on your head
I got money on your head, like a fucking Jesus piece
I got money on your head, I got money on your head
I got money on your head, like a fucking Jesus piece
