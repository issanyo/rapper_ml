[Intro]
Aye look, peep game right, Nard & B I told Nard I just bought this new ice, he gon tell me I paid too much for this muhfucka, haha, I think this muhfucka hittin' though, Ion really give a damn Trenchwerk

[Hook]
Ayy, I got these diamonds on my chain, tunnel vision on my brain
I’m just focused (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Hundred dollars to my name, in the trap making plays
I just sold ya (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
And when they said I play no games, ride that beat like I'm insane
I need a chauffeur (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Misunderstand ain't understood, the closest he been to the hood
Was the motor (whoa whoa whoa whoa)

[Verse 1]
First 48 he in that room, I heard he slipped when he told
Got this beat from our boy Ye, you know they dipped it in gold
I been hustling ain't no refund, when I ship it, it's sold
I don't trust none of these niggas so I'm gripping my tool
Momma said "stay on your feet", so yeah I tip in my shoes
I keep my eyes on they mouth, right when they whisper the move
Woke up this morning, told my son, “RoRo this one for you”
I hid some money under the tongue, in the front of the stu
Influence them they wanna live just like me
Buy property and own they home just like me
Keep that money save it up and they gon hate clearly
I couldn’t afford it growing up but never fake jewelry

[Hook]
Now I got these diamonds on my chain, tunnel vision on my brain
I’m just focused (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Hundred dollars to my name, in the trap making plays
I just sold ya (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
And when they said I play no games, ride that beat like I'm insane
I need a chauffeur (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Misunderstand ain't understood, the closest he been to the hood
Was the motor (whoa whoa whoa whoa)

[Verse 2]
Get on these beats, I close my eyes, and yeah I speak from my soul
I keep that heater under my pillow cause I can't sleep when it's cold
I can't fuck with none of these niggas I be peepin' they hoes
And I made it out the hood I had to reach for my goals
I had to learn it by myself for when my teacher was gone
She said I never wouldn't be shit but see my teacher was wrong
I know that karma coming back and yeah, you reap what you sow
They thought my ship was going to sink, I had to keep it afloat
Thought I went broke but I was just saving up
I still ain't met my quota and I still ain't made enough
Keep that money save it up and they gon hate clearly
I couldn't afford it growing up but never fake jewelry

[Hook]
Now I got these diamonds on my chain, tunnel vision on my brain
I’m just focused (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Hundred dollars to my name, in the trap making plays
I just sold ya (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
And when they said I play no games, ride that beat like I'm insane
I need a chauffeur (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Misunderstand ain't understood, the closest he been to the hood
Was the motor (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
