[Intro]
Aye look I don't call alot of people
So when I call you pick up
I could be doing anything right now
You feel me , you dig what im saying bro

[Hook]
I just need me somebody I can talk too
Even if your phone on one percent answer when I call you
I don't know where it went wrong a lot of shit been going on
It's something about that pussy baby I can't leave you alone
Been on the road for eighteen months feel like so long
Been on the road for eighteen months it feel too long
Been with yo ho three days she already too gone
And it feel like too long , im still hot and im flown

[Verse 1]

Get wrong have niggas outside of yo momma house in that driveway nigga

I know that these niggas gone hate on me for the rest of my life
I know that these bitches gone keep waiting on me so I make them my wife
Hard know I got to go

In Vegas playing poker on the cards
Wanna get with my heart but I know that

[Hook]
I just need me somebody I can talk too
Even if your phone on one percent answer when I call you
I don't know where it went wrong a lot of shit been going on
It's something about that pussy baby I can't leave you alone
Been on the road for eighteen months feel like so long
Been on the road for eighteen months it feel too long
Been with yo ho three days she already too gone
And it feel like too long , im still hot and im flown

[Outro]
Theres something about your smell
Theres something about the way you wear your hair (Make me feel some type of way)
I like it but can't show it
Can I call on you when I need somebody to talk to
