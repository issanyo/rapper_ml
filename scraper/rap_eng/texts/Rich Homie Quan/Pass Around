[Intro]
Them hundred dollar bill what my arm throwin'
Weed in rotation keep them blunts goin'
I know that ho the business

[Verse 1]
I say the swoop must be tripping
Why she hitting my line this early
Text messages say she outside
So I closed my blinds and curtains
If she find out another bitch here
I know she going try and hurt me
But deep down you know I don't play that
How the fuck she know where I stay at (Ion't know bro)
She probably asked Lisa then they asked around
Red had her first then I caught her
So the ho been passed around
Like lights camera action now
Boomerang dick she'll be back around
And I call her Lil Rondo cause she been passed around
I'm ballied down from head to toe
My team winning, bitch check the score
And that blunt on me cause I'm next to blow
And if they don't get what I'm saying, so rerun me
I can't stop dropping these hits
Clumsy

[Hook x2]
She bad as hell, we pass around
Like hot potato, your ho get passed around
When finished with her, we gone pass her down
Call them hoes contagious by the way they getting passed around

[Verse 2]
Might bring that chevy to a stop and turn back around
Roll the window down and let that chopper pass around
If you ain't from over here we gotta pat you down
I was in Houston for a lil minute
Now I'm back in town
I say my bitch missed me, my mama did too
And it's over with when you get through (with her)
And she passed around
Make sure you don't kiss that girl
Cause I swear she gotta mouth on her
She passed around like a joystick so I played the game
No Damon Wayans..
But when I left I caused major pain
I'm flowing out the same way I came
She passed around but I ain't gone say her name

[Hook x4]
