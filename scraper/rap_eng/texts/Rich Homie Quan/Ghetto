[Verse 1: August Alsina]
I love the way you keep them heels on
Hair ain't yours but it’s paid for and it’s real long
Show them tattoos when you switch it up with your J's on
And you got an ass so fat that I can’t help but feel on
And you keep it real when it comes to having sex, girl you don’t ever flex
Long as I fuck you good, you ain’t worried 'bout what’s next
That’s why I keep you here, you ain’t like them other hoes
Cause you the fucking best, just in case you didn’t know

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
Cause you ain’t got a half a million dollar condo
And you ain’t got a hundred thousand dollar car
But you got a billion dollar body, trust me I know
You keep it hood no matter where you are

[Hook: August Alsina]
Cause you come from the ghetto, love 'em from the ghetto
Girl you the type I like, that’s why I keep you right
You out the ghetto, love 'em from the ghetto
Ain’t afraid to let it show, baby, gon' and let them know
You out the ghetto, better let'em know
You from the ghetto, better let’em know
Girl you are the ghetto, better let ’em know
Better let’em know, you are that G-H-E-TT-O

[Verse 2]
You hold it down and you never let them haters come around
Girl that’s why I keep you on speed dial
Just in case some shit get bad
Keep that ratchet in your bag and a little cash
Just in case I need you
If they lock me down I know I'd see you, that’s without a doubt
I know you understand how it go, but you’re down for the ride
That’s why I still keep you by my side

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
Cause you ain’t got a half a million dollar condo
And you ain’t got a hundred thousand dollar car
But you got a billion dollar body, trust me I know
You keep it hood no matter where you are

[Hook: August Alsina]
Cause you come from the ghetto, love 'em from the ghetto
Girl you the type I like, that’s why I keep you right
You out the ghetto, love 'em from the ghetto
Ain’t afraid to let it show, baby, gon' and let them know
You out the ghetto, better let'em know
You from the ghetto, better let’em know
Girl you are the ghetto, better let ’em know
Better let’em know, you are that G-H-E-TT-O

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
She G-H-E-TT-O, my little buddy, my little hoe
Been fucking with her since I was in high school, she had my heart and secrets too
She was born and raised in the projects, never listen to what a guy said
She been going though shit, I can tell, because her eyes red
Her heart hurt, it been beat up, I wanna start over, don't mislead ya
I cross my heart like I pledge allegiance, I give my all if you don’t leave me
She G-H-E-TT-O
Cause you never see her with money, don’t mean she broke
Shawty down my pimping, shawty know how it goes
Shawty know her position and shawty play her role
Got August in here with me and I could rap it acapella
I fuck with you lil baby, even though you from the

[Hook: August Alsina]
Ghetto, love 'em from the ghetto
Girl you the type I like, that’s why I keep you right

Better let’em know, you are that G-H-E-TT-O
