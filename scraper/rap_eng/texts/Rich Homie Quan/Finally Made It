[Hook]
We finally made it
Told my momma we ain't gotta stress no more
No more unemployed checks no more
I swear I'mma get her that big house with that flexing gate
No more Section 8
Cause we finally made it
We finally made it
We finally made it
I know Teezy would of been proud of me
That's why he still living inside of me

[Verse 1]
I say we made it
We had to brand ourselves
Cause we ain't basic
In my pocket there's a phonebook, alotta pages
Got your address so don't play me
I'll have your momma tied up even your baby
I'm spreading wide, Bowflex
Fuck til she bow-legged
Feeling on her booty
Like damn that's fake them booty shots
He cuffin' bitches, police
I been rolling for like, four days
She wanna suck my dick go 'head
I been to hell and back, enough said
I remember making a pellets in the weirdest places
Fuck nigga put us out
Momma always told me remember faces
And I can't spit soft
I gotta go the hardest
I tell 'em trademark this

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I need to see a doctor cause I'm sick, been spittin'
Plus I got alot of partners in the pen, and they did it
Cause I'm vicious, and I'm like a snake
I wrap around them, then I spit venom
And I kill 'em
And I stay down with my hustle
You don't know my struggle
My momma worked the double
Just so I can have duffles
I couldn't take a loss
I had to make my money back
Told my momma she could dye all her gray hair
Cause they ain't comin' back
Now I'm on top
And these niggas want to hate
They see I came from the block
And stayed down the same way
And I got banged up by the cops
But got back out the same day
And I pat myself on my back nigga...
