[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
My niggas gon' ride for me, they'll do whatever I say so
Sexy girl ain't have no work so I put her ass on my payroll
Ridin' 'round on that monster truck, scrapped up with this [?]
I ain't really wanna fuck with her, hasta luego
Hasta luego, hasta luego
Hasta luego, hasta luego
Hasta luego, hasta luego
Hasta luego, hasta luego

[Verse: Rich Homie Quan]
I see you lady if you habla español
Shawty was mine ever since she can't go no more
Go with the misses, but no more cause I'm not your señor
Why you trick me? I would've thought I was in love
Love, love, love, love
Feelin' like TLC, I'm no scrub
Scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub
Never hangin' outside of my [?], I own all my own shit
I still fuck with all of my exes, I'm never lonely
They got questions so I invest it into my own shit
I won't ever exit, I swear that I'll keep on goin' in
I swear I left 'em breathless, I'm infamous [?]
Now I need 40 plus extra for another show again
Plus you little whores, you keep textin', she want some more of this
I don't wanna look at it nigga if I can't afford it
If she say she do not suck dick, boy I swear she borin'
Lay her on her back, then after that might let my boys hit
I made that bitch mad and my messages she's ignorin'
She actin' like she want it but she don't want it because she know

[Hook]
