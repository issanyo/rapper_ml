Me and her had never made love 'til I fucked her
Lil lil mama never for it' til I bust her
And you pretty, pretty girl, no cover
Fuck you with no rubber
Since your family don't like me I'll let shots go at your brother
And your body look like gold when we fuck on Versace covers
Just because that pussy good, that don't mean I'm a trust you
That crazy bitch stalkin' my brother Thugger
Young Thug
She caught me creepin with my old ho
She ran up like "yeah yeah," I was like "no, no"
My lookout man was my right hand but he was wrong though
Then I seen diamonds come off of my neighbor's porch
And it was her she had a Louis Vuitton purse clean as detergent she had the same exact face as my brother's nurse
And he in a hearse I never looked at it for what it's worth
Young Thug and Rich Homie Quan
So I never made love, never made love
I never made love, never made love
I never made love, never made love
I never made love, never made love (Never made love, never ever ever ever made love)
I never made love, never made love
(I ain't ever made love)

Young Thug
I never made love, never made love
When she open up, I'm a taste her
X out everyone and then erase her
I'm sorry for lyin'to your face, yeah
I'm a marry her and bouquet her
Leavin'out the house drunk and she stumbles
Be all on her mind, she can't even think of
She walkin'off, I look at her like cable
Boolin with your partners at a party Theyhey don't know what the fuck love means
She say she never waste time on a nigga
Yeah that came out of your jaws, baby

I heard it, even though I suck it 'til she lockin' up
Lockin'like handcuffs
Give me all your time, every day
Girl how come we never made love at your spot
Cause you don't want your other rich homie be findin out
She want it so I spent 12 thousand on a lil rug
I'm just tryna tell you ain't tryna make you look low

Even though we never made love, never made love
(Never made love, never made love never made love)
She never made love, never made love
(Never made love aye)
She never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never felt love, never felt love
(Never made love, never made love)

Well I'm a change that there
I might wake up and buy you everything rare
I'm not cheatin'on you no more I don't care
You wanna be with me, I'm a roll the dice now
Roll it, I buy a Rollie, I'm a buy that bitch a Rollie
That pack keep rollin', I'm a buy that bitch some more shit
Cause I fucked her sister then I fucked on all her cousins
Bitch I'm a blood you I fucked on all your bousins
She smiling in my face, tellin' me she love it
She like the way my pants don't sag even though they're stuffin'
She won't T.I. on me, she don't care bout no money
Hey hey, wait, don't leave

Majestic harmonizing

They trip out all the time tellin you I'm on some bullshit
Parallel parkin' that pussy, they like my motion
Put that on my mama, now Stunna know that I'm loaded
When my partner see it he stands up like he in Foldger's
I ain't like that shit so I hit him right in his shit
Then I told him, "don't ever do that shit there again"
How you feel if I see your ho and fuck on the kid?
I'm a catch a body (of she leave me on a plane)
Yes I said I'm the best and I put that on the rest
When you make me mad I try to get back and get some head
And I know that's wrong but my dumb ass still did it instead
Then I put the strap to my own head like boy I'm on one
Then I told her don't ever do it again
Every guy you look at, I'll turn him to wind
Yeah, then I look up at God like this

Then I realized I'd never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
She never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
She never ever, ever made love
