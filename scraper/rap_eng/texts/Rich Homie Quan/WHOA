[Verse 1: Reese]
At Waffle House, two cups served
Double cup the bitch, like WHOA
Everything designer, Versace, Versace
My niggas seen it like WHOA
My trap house bunking
Niggas seen the barrels and the gas, like WHOA
Everything on me, everything on me
Nigga know it, like WHOA
Hopping out the Benz niggas thought it's James Bond
Shawty like WHOA
I'm leaning up, leaning up
Double sip, crack the bottle like WHOA
My niggas we out here, my niggas we out here like WHOA
Everything on me my nigga, everything on me my nigga


[Chorus: Reese]
My nigga like WHOA
Aye Them my Don, [?] Don niggas
Them my partnas, them my shawties, my WOE
Bank roll, bank roll
Bands in the right pocket, like WHOA
And then my partna go SCRRR! SCRRR!
Hopped out the Benz like WHOA
A nigga seen me when I'm hooping on a nigga
Balling on them like WHOA

[Verse 2: Reese]
I'm feeling like Dipset
Cameron, Burberry Timbs on a young nigga like WHOA
[?] Alert, Rap on them
Bloody murder, bloody murder
There she go, like WHOA
Everything gucci, but I don't wear Gucci
My Woe, my nigga
Playing with them Bands like WHOA
Moving through this bitch, like everything Kosher
Pull up on a shawty like WHOA
Goddamn goddamn, saran wrap it down cause a boy so dope
Fresh pair of white base, cleaner than a bar of soap
Country nigga posted in LA, smoking on the dope, WHOA WHOA
Should I go with my nigga, that was WHOA
Ride around posted with my folk
Off in the club, with them bands in my pocket
See me, take a picture, prison pose

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
Pulled up in the trap like WHOA
Got a bitch jumping like WHOA (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Gave me more traffic like, green light I'm shouting out GO (go, go ,go)
Shawty act retarded when it comes to get money, but she slowed (slow, slow, slow)
Shawty tryna to fall in love with me, but a nigga like No (no, no , no)
Fendi belt hanging off my pants, nigga like WHOA (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Dislocated my shoulder on that skate, board (board, board)
With all these guns I feel like G.I. Joe (joe, joe, joe)
Stop it, Reese gon' Tell em

[Chorus]
