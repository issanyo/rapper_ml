[Intro]
Zaytoven
That boy Cass!

[Chorus]
Came along way from sharin’ rooms with my brother, yeah
We was on our own 'cause my momma worked a double, yeah
Couldn’t afford designer it was Hilfiger, Tommy yeah
I was 10 saw my cousin cookin' dope, he said, "Don’t come in here"
Every since then I been influenced to get that money, yeah
8 years old, I knew Ben Frank was a hundred, yeah
Count the cash, get the bag, track star, run it up
You might skress about yo check, because that shit not long enough

[Verse 1]
I woulda gave that bitch a whole meal because I wanted her
Hollywood bitch, she got two kids and her tummy tucked
You put up with my shit, you not weak girl, you strong enough
You were my best friend when I was broke and I was lonely girl
I was your best friend when you were down and you were vulnerable
Back when we was swipin’ EBT down by the corner store
I was in the game, I wasn't never watchin' from the crowd
In eleventh grade, yeah I had my locker smellin’ loud
Summer of twelfth grade, 'round the time I made my first child
You see a lot of pain when you shake my hand, look at my eyes
I told my brother, "No more sharin’ rooms, we gon get a bigger house"
Never forget where I came, that what this about

[Chorus]
Came along way from sharin’ rooms with my brother, yeah
We was on our own 'cause my momma worked a double yeah
Couldn’t afford designer, it was Hilfiger, Tommy yeah
I was 10, saw my cousin cookin' dope he said, "Don’t come in here"
Ever since then I been influenced to get that money, yeah
8 years old, I knew Ben Frank was a hundred, yeah
Count the cash, get the bag, track star, run it up
You might skress about yo check, because that shit not long enough

[Verse 2]
Money not a option, if we want it we gon' buy it dawg
Bought that 442 from shawty, I damn near blow the tires off
Keep my concentration on that money, don't take my eyes off
We in this together, we can’t lose 'cause that'd be our fault
I’m gon' make it up to you, I promise that my bad brotha
Love me genuine, just like he trust me wit yo last dolla
He must be from up north, he think he slick, he tryna fast talk
Four hundred thousand in the Louie duffel, that that bag talk
They say that money on your brain turn to bad thoughts
I'ma keep some money in the bank and in my dad’s vault
I saw my cousin in the kitchen, he was fixin’ a quarter
Don’t put these hoes before fam, blood thicker than water (rich homie baby!)

[Chorus]
Came along way from sharin’ rooms with my brother, yeah
We was on our own 'cause my momma worked a double, yeah
Couldn’t afford designer, it was Hilfiger, Tommy yeah
I was 10, saw my cousin cookin' dope, he said "Don’t come in here"
Ever since then I been influenced to get that money, yeah
8 years old, I knew Ben Frank was a hundred, yeah
Count the cash, get the bag, track star, run it up
You might skress about yo check, because that shit not long enough
