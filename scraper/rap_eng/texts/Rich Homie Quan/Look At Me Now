[Hook]
Its been a long week, I ain't make shit
Been taking loses all day
Wish I could hit rewind
I remember them levis when I wanted balmain
My momma yeah she tried to make sure that we right but I ain't ate all day
I'm a soldier like reebok and that's probably why he thought I wasn't gone make it
Tell'em look at me now
Same muthafuckas that thought I wasn't gone make it tell them niggas just look at me now
Tell them look at me now
Laughing in 2Pac voice like Picture me rollin
Picture me rollin
Picture me rollin
Picture me rollin
Picture me rollin

[Verse 1]
Dropped the top on the 442 like picture me rollin'
Got a 223 and a 442 and nigga I'm focused
Ion play games, ion't know about you but I do soak it
Got on all my chains, yeah all my jewelry call me no neck
Back to the basics
Tell'em what it was
Give that boy a band-aid shoutout to the bloods
Big B's like a beehive
I know you hear the buzz
I ain't talkin' bout a cup but my shooters keep a mug
And a shotgun full of slugs
Get knocked off for a dub
If the cops come don't budge
I'm in the finer car like the judge
Fuck the D.A and the prosecutor cause they tryna prosecute me
Brand new chopper bout to use it
Hands up hallelujah

[Hook]
Its been a long week, I ain't make shit
Been taking loses all day

Tell'em look at me now
Same muthafuckas that thought I wasn't gone make it tell them niggas just look at me now
Tell them look at me now
Laughing in 2Pac voice like Picture me rollin
Picture me rollin
Picture me rollin
Picture me rollin
Picture me rollin

[Verse 2]
Rollin out with your hoe
Rollin out with my niggas
Ain't nun bigger than a F 9 wood deuce eagle
Pullin up with a sexy black bitch look like she from Nigeria
I say my prayers everyday, going to hell the only thing I fear
I grew up so broke
I couldn't live like that
Had to jump off that porch, since then ain't went back
20 percent of my niggas they crip
Other 80 percent scream blat
Stole the car then I flipped
We use to ride around like that
My momma didn't know that I had stopped going to class
And all my partners they was trappin'
And I wasn't thinking bout rappin'
I was somewhere being nasty
Funny high school I ended up passing
Friends? I never had'em (don't matter)

Picture me rollin
Picture me rollin
Picture me rollin
Picture me rollin
