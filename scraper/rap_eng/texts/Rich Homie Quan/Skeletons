[Intro: Rich Homie Quan]
Yeah, like
I'd be lying if I told y'all I ain't have feelings no more
You know what I'm sayin', I feel all this shit nigga, yeah

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
Got some skeletons in my closet, I'm afraid to bring 'em out
Got some secrets I can't tell you, they on my mind, I think about it
I told my mama no more cryin', your oldest son gon' make you proud
She said son go get that money, don't let them leeching niggas around you
You need someone to have your back
You need someone to have your back
When it all get bad, need someone to have your back
Might stuff my problems in this blunt
Loyalty deeper than words, you got my back, I got your front

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
I'm at Magic on a Monday, I'm just minding my business
Get somethin' to eat from the kitchen, I ain't got time for no bitches
It didn't take long to get up here 'cause I was flyin' in a Bentley
DJ played all my new shit, I had to slide him a fifty
Shit ain't how it used to be, feel like I'm growin' too fast
Bought everything I ever wanted 'cause I was broke in the past
Watchin' the dope boys run it up, they gave me hope in the past
They put them cuffs around my ankles and throwed my folks in that van
Everything I quote, they be sayin'
I can't joke when they playin'
After she sucked me, heard you fucked her
Yeah that ho went out bad
We gon' turn that dope into cash
We gon' get that money, I promise
We ain't worried 'bout none of you busters
Rich Homie baby

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
Got some skeletons in my closet, I'm afraid to bring 'em out
Got some secrets I can't tell you, they on my mind, I think about it
I told my mama no more cryin', your oldest son gon' make you proud
She said son go get that money, don't let them leeching niggas around you
You need someone to have your back
You need someone to have your back
When it all get bad, need someone to have your back
Might stuff my problems in this blunt
Loyalty deeper than words, you got my back, I got your front

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
I got some skeletons up in my closet, don't like to talk about it
'Cause never know, never know (Yah), might get stalked about it
I put a seven in the blunt, I'm lit off Cali shit
I put a seven in the cup, this is Actavis
I drive a Rolls, I got so many hoes
I got so many Rolexes cold, I'm smilin', throwin' fours
Baby mama drama, damn, they tryna torture who I am
Skeletons up in my closets, only one, no instant [?]
I need someone to have a nigga back like that
So I be with them cats that I knew before the rap
They gon' protect me like Obama, man they got a nigga back
They keep on askin' me bout murders, keep on askin' me bout murders

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
Got some skeletons in my closet, I'm afraid to bring 'em out
Got some secrets I can't tell you, they on my mind, I think about it
I told my mama no more cryin', your oldest son gon' make you proud
She said son go get that money, don't let them leeching niggas around you
You need someone to have your back
You need someone to have your back
When it all get bad, need someone to have your back
Might stuff my problems in this blunt
Loyalty deeper than words, you got my back, I got your front

[Outro: Boosie Badazz]
You got my back, I got your front nigga
The pain you feel today will be your strength tomorrow nigga
Hold your head nigga
We all go through it
