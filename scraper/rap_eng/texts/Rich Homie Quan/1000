[Hook]
I done made a million dollars, and I ain't even go to college
I heard you were talking, let me find out you ain't 'bout it
They think I'm sponsored by Olympic
No thank you, this an Audi
Mister hundred times ten, nigga keep it one thousand
Keep that shit one thousand
Fuckin' hoes by the thousands
Gon' fuck these hoes by the thousands
Stacking money by the thousands
Imma stack my money by the thousands
In the booty club we wildin'
Throwin' all these ones by the thousands
I've got to keep it one thousand

[Verse 1]
I've got to keep it one thousand, I've got to keep me a pistol
I walked out of DeKalb County, they tried to keep me in the system
And it's fam first at all times, got two brothers, one sister
I can make a thousand like all the time
So now I'm trynna get a million
Everything I'm on I'm killin' (Hold up, wait, stop)
Imma let y'all be the witness (Hold up, wait, freeze)
I can make a deaf man hear this, so don't play
Cuz a scary nigga always gon' fear me (Why Quan?)
Because you're lame
Back in the day we used to pray for them thousands
I was saving every penny growing up in public housing
That's that G shit
And for the people who said I wouldn't be shit
Guess what nigga?

[Hook]
I done made a million dollars, and I ain't even go to college
I heard you were talking, let me find out you ain't 'bout it
They think I'm sponsored by Olympic
No thank you, this an Audi
Mister hundred times ten, nigga keep it one thousand
Keep that shit one thousand
Fuckin' hoes by the thousands
Gon' fuck these hoes by the thousands
Stacking money by the thousands
Imma stack my money by the thousands
In the booty club we wildin'
Throwin' all these ones by the thousands
I've got to keep it one thousand

[Verse 2]
I've got to keep it one thousand
Just like my Guiseppes
When it comes to hoes, I've got thousands
Plus extras
That pussy clappin' like (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Young niggas shootin' guns like (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
See, I don't play that shit, but I'll spray that shit at y'all niggas
That .40 like a beeper, I go way back on you niggas
If you ain't coming with me, I advise you don't say nothing to me nigga
And that black face on that rolex looks like Akon to me nigga
I'm the type of dude who'll finesse you the play dumb-dumb on you niggas
Get the scoreboard, I said it's game over
Quan won on you niggas
With a thousand points scored on you niggas
My high school teacher did not show me shit
No she didn't
So, when I got my first check, you know I told her this

[Hook]
I done made a million dollars, and I ain't even go to college
I heard you were talking, let me find out you ain't 'bout it
They think I'm sponsored by Olympic
No thank you, this an Audi
Mister hundred times ten, nigga keep it one thousand
Keep that shit one thousand
Fuckin' hoes by the thousands
Gon' fuck these hoes by the thousands
Stacking money by the thousands
Imma stack my money by the thousands
In the booty club we wildin'
Throwin' all these ones by the thousands
I've got to keep it one thousand
