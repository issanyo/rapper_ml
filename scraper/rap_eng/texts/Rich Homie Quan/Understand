R.H.Q
Rich Homie TK in this motherfucker
Lets get it

[Hook: TK Kravitz & Rich Homie Quan]
I might just drop a hundred on your head, bae
Cause money on my mind like a headband
I'm just tryna make sure that you understand
I'm just tryna make sure that you understand
Make sure that you understand
Make sure that you understand
She can't hit me so why throw death signs up
I'm just tryna make sure that you understand
(Listen up baby closer)
(Woah, woah, woah)

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Hundred thousand in each (?) (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sleepover, lotta bitches (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All they wanna do is fuck me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Skinny jeans, pistol tucked bitch (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: TK Kravitz]
Quan pulled up in the foreign
You ain't getting money you snoring
Threesome's starting to get boring
Oh yeah
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
Ran up my money once again
Decisions getting harder, don't know what to spend
Her boyfriend so mad, don't know where she been
Lil bro tell me why we can't trust these bitches because

[Verse 4: TK Kravitz & Rich Homie Quan]
I ain't getting married no time soon, no jumping brooms
House party, mansion full of hoes, orgies in every room
"Quan I need a rubber, can't hit her raw, what am I gon' do?"
"Sit down and get head from Dog Bih, call her blue"
Fifteen hundred for the shoes
Seventeen hundred for the belt, (oh shit nigga)
Nine thousand for the check
It's leather hoe, nah, it's leather hoe

[Hook: TK Kravitz & Rich Homie Quan]
I might just drop a hundred on your head, bae
Cause money on my mind like a headband
I'm just tryna make sure that you understand
I'm just tryna make sure that you understand
Make sure that you understand
Make sure that you understand
She can't hit me so why throw death signs up
I'm just tryna make sure that you understand

Understand what I'm saying
Understand what I've been through
Understand these problems

Understand I'mma be there
Understand they got problems like you don't really mean nun'

[Verse 7: TK Kravitz & Rich Homie Quan]
Run it up (By Myself, oh yeah)
Thumb threw it (By Myself, oh yeah)
I might count it up (By myself)
When I touch it you know I might fuck her (By myself)

[Verse 8: Rich Homie Quan]
68 thousand, Audemars Piguet
Had a rock on me, yeah baby, I'm not turnt up, but I'm flexing (oh, yeah)
Cash with me, no alphabet

[Hook: TK Kravitz & Rich Homie Quan]
