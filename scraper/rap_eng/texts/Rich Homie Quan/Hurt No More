[Intro]
Aye, I made an oath to my homies man
I told 'em they ain't gotta hurt no more
And I told 'em that's my word man
Rich Homie baby, yeah!

[Verse 1]
They tell me make a wish and I say whole thang
Give them folks my alias and not my whole name
My cousin on my daddy side sell cocaine
Take off on that purple, call it Soul Plane
I get my blow from Bone and Ricky cause they dope the same
If you get locked up unpredicted then that ho to blame
Should of never let that bitch knew you was on the way
You can bluff 'em off that sack if you keep your pokerface
Fuck that, break your shoulder blades
Hold the trumph don't throw ya spades
Left my Xbox in the water so I can soak the game
I heard your lawyer blowed the case you need your own help
Nigga, you can't do shit for me
Bitch, I pay my own self

[Hook]
I'm employed, my rich homies ain't gotta work no more
They saying I can't put rich homies on my shirt no more
I got 'em paying for my attention ain't gon' hurt before
Every chance I'm with 'em I tell my niggas that
We ain't gon' hurt no more, yeah
I tell 'em we ain't gon' hurt no more, yeah
We ain't gon' hurt no More
I tell 'em We Ain't gon' hurt no more, yeah

[Verse 2]
If You Was Thinking I Was Gone, I'm Back Baby
Hate Picking Up The Phone, Send A Fax Baby
I'm Riding In A Ghost Call It Pat Swazy
Yo Mama Did Dope While She Was Pregnant Nigga You's A Crack Baby
No Keyboard But I'm Backspacing
No Precious I Love Fat Faces
If It Don't Make Money Then It Don't Make Sense
Rich Homies They Stank Cause They On They Shit
And Ion Get Hit Nigga I Ain't Vick Nigga
See I'm a Rich Nigga But I'll Spray Spray Spray
I Got Me Six Figures
My Clique Bigger Than The KKK It's A Whole Lotta Us
You Ain't Shit Nigga We Ain't With Nigga
You Say You Killed Nigga But You Ain't Killed Niggas
I'm A Real nigga
Lemme Tell You How It Is Nigga
These Niggas Try To Come In Your Face Just To See What's Going On
And it Be The Same Ones That Take Off When Everything Start Going Wrong
They Say That Lame Bitch Straight And She Ain't Hurt For Nothing
That Same Nigga Hatin
Got Em Working For Me

[Hook]

[Outro]
