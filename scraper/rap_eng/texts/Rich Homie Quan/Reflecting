[Intro]
30, you a fool for this one

[Chorus]
Sittin’ back reminiscin’ on my past
I’m focusin’ on the money reflecting on my accomplishments
Knock me down, I got right back up and laughed
I know that I made ‘em mad, showed these folks I done, done this shit
Counted me out and I know they wasn’t in my favor
I had to pick up my phone and call bae like, "What the fuck is goin’ wrong?
Tell me like, what the fuck did I do wrong?"
Gave you my all, bae no question

[Verse 1]
Mama told me when I was lil you gotta get it how you live
Man, that ocean view out front, you know it compliment the crib
I can’t smell none of my money, put it up in vacuum seal
Doin’ da dash in the Bentley, tryna get home to the kids
Quarter millie Bentley parked it in the middle of the six
Quarter millie worth of jewelry, that's two chains plus my wrist
That old school was lookin’ silly, threw some thangs on that bitch
Paint wet, Migo did it, ain’t no stain on that bitch
Hand him all that paper like your date and name on that bitch
When that money start gettin’ low, they get to changin' and shit
I didn’t know I would be successful, now I’m famous and shit
Umbrella for the pain, I can’t get no rain on these kicks
They black ballin’ niggas, I don’t want my name on that list
Fuck the problem, I don’t got time to explain to no nigga
Droppin’ bombs on a fuck nigga head if he scared
No need to repeat it cause I said what I said

[Chorus]
Sittin’ back reminiscin’ on my past
I’m focusin’ on the money reflecting on my accomplishments
Knock me down, I got right back up and laughed
I know that I made ‘em mad, gotta show these folks I done, done this shit
Counted me out and I know they wasn’t in my favor
I had to pick up my phone and call bae like, "What the fuck is goin’ wrong?
Tell me like, what the fuck did I do wrong?"
Gave you my all, bae no question

[Verse 2]
Million dollar dreams, it ain’t hard to understand, when I’m talkin’ now
I can’t tell another lie when I got my hand on that Bible
Counted up went on the plane with two hands when I'm stackin'
We just flew in from Japan, couldn’t understand what they was talkin’
Fishtailin’ out the club, boy my tires burnin' rubber
State to state, I’m catchin’ bags, I can’t get tired of this hustle
And then we start goin’ broke, yeah that’s a sign we in trouble
'Cause that my money, don’t waste time 'cause I know mine it don't double
I done came a long way from my mama basement (basement)
Made a couple million, caught some cases (cases)
Spray yo nigga like we do that fragrance (fragrance)
Yesterday Ferrari but today Benz (nah nigga)
Money that the only thing that make sense (talk nigga)
Why would I put in twenty to make ten? (fuck it nigga)
Cut off all ties and relations (cut 'em nigga)
Roll up all my problems, now I face it (Rich homie baby)

[Chorus]
Sittin’ back reminiscin’ on my past
I’m focusin’ on the money reflecting on my accomplishments
Knock me down, I got right back up and laughed
I know that I made ‘em mad, showed these folks I done, done this shit
Counted me out and I know they wasn’t in my favor
I had to pick up my phone and call bae like, "What the fuck is goin’ wrong?
Tell me like, what the fuck did I do wrong?"
Gave you my all, bae no question
