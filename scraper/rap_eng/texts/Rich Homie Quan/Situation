[Intro]
I'm gonna tell y'all niggas a true story, man
All you gotta do is listen to the mothafucka
If not, cut me off then, nigga!
But I doubt you do that, nah, real talk

[Hook]
The situation could've been a whole lot worser but I swear a nigga could've died
When my situation got a little better, lot of these fuck niggas, they looked surprised
And it be the closest people hating on your situation, looking at you with a crooked eye
And make sure every move you make, just make sure that you multiply
And make a better situation, situation, tryna make it better, situation
Situation, situation, tryna make it better, situation
(Situation) Situation, situation
(Situation) Gotta make me the best situation

[Verse 1]
Situation, huh, keep 'em hatin', yeah
The Rolls Royce got a car key, nigga, but I still keep 'em waitin'
Yeah, roll that nigga, I had to big face it, for real
MoÃ«t nigga, champagne, don't drank, for real
If I were to pull up in a two [?]
Too many hoes in the Sprinter, I done put like 8 inside that bih
VVS diamond they shinin', I put fifty pointers around my wrist
Better not come 'round with your bitch
Hit the hoe one time, shit over with
24, make it look like a stolen bitch
[?] Kobe whip
Spent a hunnid K to get the motor built
[?] with the chrome on the lip
Pockets fat like Cheech with a thong in the middle
Give a fuck how he feel 'cause I don't know that nigga
I show that nigga by administration, leave him bleedin'
Man, that's a real situation

[Hook]
The situation could've been a whole lot worser but I swear a nigga could've died
When my situation got a little better, lot of these fuck niggas, they looked surprised
And it be the closest people hating on your situation, looking at you with a crooked eye
And make sure every move you make, just make sure that you multiply
And make a better situation, situation, tryna make it better, situation
Situation, situation, tryna make it better, situation
(Situation) Situation, situation
(Situation) Gotta make me the best situation

[Verse 2]
The situation fucked up, shorty, I'm fucked up
She was like a scratch off, it felt like I loved her
But I should've never loved her
Because it seemed like she wanted my money
And that's a bad situation
Nah, that's a fucked up situation
Quan, wake up 'cause you really made it
Ones, I throw 'em if you really shake it
Fun with your bitch, I renovate her
Ton of frozen money in the 'frigerator
Run if you can't handle the situation
Heard they sleeping on Quan, give 'em pillow cases
Watch your step in that line 'cause that's where them snakes at
The game like a refund, no take backs
Hundred thousand dollars, two days made that
Instagram on the iPad in the Maybach
And I'm eating at the same time, reclined, laid back
Quan going broke, nah don't say that
I'ma stay up, keep that at that
Big mac truck, yeah paint it black
Top on the coupe, it came attached
You want a bad situation, how lame is that?

[Hook]
The situation could've been a whole lot worser but I swear a nigga could've died
When my situation got a little better, lot of these fuck niggas, they looked surprised
And it be the closest people hating on your situation, looking at you with a crooked eye
And make sure every move you make, just make sure that you multiply
And make a better situation, situation, tryna make it better, situation
Situation, situation, tryna make it better, situation
(Situation) Situation, situation
(Situation) Gotta make me the best situation
