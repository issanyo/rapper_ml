[Verse One]
I know a lot of niggas out here broke who will do anything for that paper
And I know a lot of bitches out here broke, wearing a lot of fake hair, a bunch of make-up(get back hoe)
I was broke down bad with a pager (I was)
I'm from East Atlanta not Decatur (Zone 6)
I remember we ain't use to have cable (have none)
I remember I was hungry I would stay up
And I'm like what would you do for some paper? (I don't know)
Back then nigga I do anything for some paper, straight up (that right too)
That bid I did, I was kicking door for that paper (get money)
And them neighbors said they say me creeping round the corner
But they just hating cause I'm on the come up

[Pre-Chorus]
I remember I was broke down bad for the longest (hey)
Had to thank my God on the way up (I was broke nigga)
On the fuck shit riding with the 40 (fa fa)
If you owe me, nigga better pay up (pay up nigga)
Don't talk that shit nigga show me (just show me)
I'll aim for a ass nigga straight up (rich homie)
Got a couple bitches saying they know me (you don't know me)
But Ima let the money talk for me, so I'm like

[Chorus]
