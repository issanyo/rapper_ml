[Chorus: Zach Farlow]
I just want a bad bitch who ain't got no clothes on
I’m far from average, girl I thought I told ya
Lookin' super hot, like someone left the stove on
Don't tell ’em all the facts, 'cause that might start a problem
So keep it on the low (low)
Just keep it on the low, bae (low)
Just keep it on the low (low)
Keep it on the low, bae (low)
Keep it on the low

[Verse 1: Zach Farlow]
Zach crazy, that's facts, baby
Shoppin' down at the North Hole
'Cause I swear to god my cash crazy
I'ma knock that pussy the fuck out
So please excuse my last statement
Escort, baby, that's a touchdown
These hoes crazy, wanna fuss now
'Cause you the only [?] on my nuts tonight
They stay mad at me
’Cause I’ve been tryna talk to the max lately
Oh, you love flashy shit?
Come and spend all this cash with me
Heard you a classy bih
I guess you wouldn't mind passing me
Think you bad, but you ain’t bad as me
I'm the best at shit that you won't believe, yeah
So keep it on the low, baby
No one else has gotta know, baby
I don't know how to start a taxi service ’cause I keep on driving these hoes crazy
[?]
Lose it, I'ma go and get some more guap
And I love makin' these hoes holler when they bodies shakin' like a Coke bottle, low

[Chorus: Zach Farlow]
I just want a bad bitch who ain't got no clothes on
I'm far from average, girl I thought I told ya
Lookin' super hot, like someone left the stove on
Don't tell 'em all the facts, 'cause that might start a problem
So keep it on the low (low)
Just keep it on the low, bae (low)
Just keep it on the low (low)
Keep it on the low, bae (low)
Keep it on the low

[Verse 2]
Keep it on the low just like nobody told ya
I was up early like I was on them [?]
I got the pussy clappin', they know, yeah
[?] that far wit a nigga like me (yeah nigga)
Got a four-four wit me, nah, nigga, no Pistol Pete
She takes whatever from me, long as it's free
I ain't talkin' Alicia when I say I got them keys
[?] 'cause I got it on go
And my car go fast [?]
[?]
[?] what I told her

[Chorus: Zach Farlow]
I just want a bad bitch who ain't got no clothes on
I'm far from average, girl I thought I told ya
Lookin' super hot, like someone left the stove on
Don't tell 'em all the facts, 'cause that might start a problem
So keep it on the low (low)
Just keep it on the low, bae (low)
Just keep it on the low (low)
Keep it on the low, bae (low)
Keep it on the low
