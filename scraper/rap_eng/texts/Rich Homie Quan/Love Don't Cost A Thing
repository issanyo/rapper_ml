[Hook]
I say before I go to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to take
If I were to die off in my sleep I pray I see them heaven's Gates
Everyday I drop down to my knees
Don't know what tomorrow bring
I'm gone spend no money on these bits
Cause love don't cost a thing
Love don't cost a thing, love don't cost a thing
No Nick Canon baby, I swear love don't cost a thing
No Christiana Milian, love don't cost a thing
Shoot your Cupid with no gun, I swear love don't cost a thing

[Verse 1]
Love don't cost a thing but that pussy do
Make 'em spit in chain that's what Pusha do
I just want her brain, heard it bullet proof
Bitch don't say my name, you know what I do
Bitch why you playing childish games, I ain't Dr. Seuss
Tryna kill me, Tom Cruise, Mission Impossible
I know that I got to go
Make a little money, I got to throw
Tell me who is better than me, I gots to know
I gots to go hard on these niggas
Why try when you know you ain't part of this you nigga
Tryna take it between her legs like Vince Carter nigga
And drop down to my knees every night

I say before I go to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to take
If I were to die off in my sleep I pray I see them living days
Everyday I drop down to my knees
Don't know what tomorrow bring
I'm gone spend no money on these bits
Cause love don't cost a thing
Love don't cost a thing, love don't cost a thing
No Nick Canon baby, I swear love don't cost a thing
No Christiana Milian, love don't cost a thing
Shoot your Cupid with no gun, I swear love don't cost a thing

[Verse 2]
Love don't cost a thing, no Nick Canon baby
I don't even know her name but she got her panties taken, by me
I told her she can't fuck nobody til she ran in by me
Fell in love with me she don't wonder why (?)
That shit for sure
Made her a plumber won't fuck nobody when I'm on tour
Even if I was deaf damn I could not ignore
Fiendin' for your love, you can smell it through my pores
McDaniels, I want you some more
I'mma (?)
(?) flexin' out on them whores
Forgive for my sins, hope he wake me up
