[Intro]
Yeah, they said I wouldn't be shit
They thought that shit was over with
Sose can't say it
Quan you got to go back to you bro

[Chorus]
When I was little I had people say I would never make it
Them same people who said it and now we separated
They think I'm sleep playin' dead no I'm just meditatin'
Don't take that fame to the head grind like you never made it
Shine like you never made it
I keep that money on my mind like I never made it
Flex like I never made it
Every check you better save it
I'm still aiming for the top like I never made it
Never made it

[Verse]
Never thought that I would be in the situation that I'm in
Never thought these folks would turn their back on me thought they was fans
All these niggas talkin', smilin' faces I had thought they was friends
That's why I had to grow my hair afro that turned to the trend
Everybody had one
When that Flex went double platinum felt like everybody hated Quan
And when y'all was 'posed to be happy this my city I didn't feel like y'all was proud of me
Feel like I was trapped in a cell, feel like y'all doubted me
Don't let that Tim Westwood shit fool you, after some Type Of Way
I swear my life turned to a movie, came a long way from that losin'
And I swear none of this shit was handed to me
Never forget I still got me a lil' family to feed, I swear

[Chorus]
When I was little I had people say I would never make it
Them same people who said it and now we separated
They think I'm sleep playin' dead no I'm just meditatin'
Don't take that fame to the head grind like you never made it
Shine like you never made it
I keep that money on my mind like I never made it
Flex like I never made it
Every check you better save it
I'm still aiming for the top like I never made it
Never made it
