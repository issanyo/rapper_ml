[Intro]
I gotta watch them niggas, man
I gotta watch them bitches, too
I gotta watch all them folk, man
Don't nobody wanna see me win

[Chorus]
I'm losin' faith in the people I think I love the most
It's hard to trust, I've been hurt before, take it for what it's worth
I bought a watch and that motherfucker, it cost a Benz
I promise this shit, we won't take a loss again
Because I'm the boss man, I'm the boss man, I'm the boss
I'm the boss man, I'm the boss man, I'm the boss
I'm the boss man, I'm the boss man, I'm the boss
I'm the boss man, I'm the boss man, I'm the boss

[Verse 1]
I'm the boss man, I was tough man, coming up
I played my Walkman, when I was walkin' to the bus
Don't get caught, man, money talk, man, listen up
My trigger finger by the middle finger, 'cause I ain't never gave a fuck
I got no small change, these are Balmains, a thousand bucks
I met a guy that I had to fly there to meet the plug
We may dap it up, show some love, but don't mention my hoe name
Work, my move on my man and he fronted me a whole thang
Tomorrow is not promised and God ain't gave us an option
I'm the boss man, yeah, like benefits with an office
In this bitch, 'cause I bought it, I know that I'm truly gifted
The more money I make, feel like my family actin' differently

[Chorus]
I'm losin' faith in the people I think I love the most
It's hard to trust, I've been hurt before, take it for what it's worth
I bought a watch and that motherfucker, it cost a Benz
I promise this shit, we won't take a loss again
Because I'm the boss man, I'm the boss man, I'm the boss
I'm the boss man, I'm the boss man, I'm the boss
I'm the boss man, I'm the boss man, I'm the boss
I'm the boss man, I'm the boss man, I'm the boss

[Verse 2]
A boss man don't go out lookin' for the work
A boss man sit back, don't get his hands dirty
A boss man on the phone makin' plays at the house or something
I've done got a little lazy, let the money counter count it first
Boss man, boss man, what them bitches call me
Can't take no loss, man, nah, man, keep them leeches off me
For what it cost, bro, bought it, bro, just to boss up
Boss man, eatin' lobster, dollar signs what I cough up
Feelin' turbulence, when I landin', I'm readin' with understandin'
You focused, got your attention, I'm hopin' you comprehend
Don't approach me, don't want you near me, I'm stressin', drinkin' a fifth
I wanna give up so bad, but I gotta get me the strength, hey

[Chorus]
I'm losin' faith in the people I think I love the most
It's hard to trust, I've been hurt before, take it for what it's worth
I bought a watch and that motherfucker, it cost a Benz
I promise this shit, we won't take a loss again
Because I'm the boss man, I'm the boss man, I'm the boss
I'm the boss man, I'm the boss man, I'm the boss
I'm the boss man, I'm the boss man, I'm the boss
I'm the boss man, I'm the boss man, I'm the boss
