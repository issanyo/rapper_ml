[Intro]
I know it's been awhile right?
Nah, it been more than a second

[Chorus]
It's been a lil minute nigga how you feel I know you
Its been a lil minute since I went back to my old self
It's been a lil minute I was busy gettin' my dough up
Its been a lil minute, lil minute, lil minute
Say it's been a lil minute since I flexed up on you niggas
It's been a lil minute since I walked in with two pistols
Cause I only need one, only gone shoot one
It's been a lil minute time to go back to that old Quan


[Verse 1]
Lehh do it
They say it's been a lil minute since I talked about some real shit that's goin on
Every single minute, every single second everything goin wrong
It's been a lil minute cause I just beat the courts and childsupport
It's been a lil minute cause I gotta lil boys so fast they growin'
Double R I love you, Devin Lamar I love you
It's been a lil minute but don't never think daddy don't love you
Aye fuck this rap shit, they just wanna hear my story but this the part I can't give yall
Y'all don't know about that pain that I be goin through
Y'all just see me for fame but still don't know what I be going through
Bit I got problems just like you do
I got bills to pay like you do
Hourglass full of sand x10 nigga


[Chorus]
It's been a lil minute nigga how you feel I know you
Its been a lil minute since I went back to my old self
It's been a lil minute I was busy gettin' my dough up
Its been a lil minute, lil minute, lil minute
Say it's been a lil minute since I flexed up on you niggas
It's been a lil minute since I walked in with two pistols
Cause I only need one, only gone shoot one
It's been a lil minute time to go back to that old Quan


[Verse 2]
Been a lil minute since I went back to the old me
Been a lil minute since I rapped bout shit they don't see
Been a lil minute since I went back to them old streets
Talkin' bout them ones I grow up with and they act like they don't even know me
Been a lil minute since I turnt up on these niggas
Been smoking raw, been a minute since a Swisher
It's been 30 plus 30 seconds nigga that's a minute
My daddy came home out the hospital wasn't limpin'
Kill these niggas, kill these niggas been a minute since I did it
Cut her off cause she got a nigga been a minute since I hit her
Been a minute since i did this
Been a minute since I went in this hard for yall


[Chorus]
It's been a lil minute nigga how you feel I know you
Its been a lil minute since I went back to my old self
It's been a lil minute I was busy gettin' my dough up
Its been a lil minute, lil minute, lil minute
Say it's been a lil minute since I flexed up on you niggas
It's been a lil minute since I walked in with two pistols
Cause I only need one, only gone shoot one
It's been a lil minute time to go back to that old Quan
