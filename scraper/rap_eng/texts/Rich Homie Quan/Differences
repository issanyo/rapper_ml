[Intro]
The difference between me and you is
I’d rather get money and try and flip me something
You can’t tell me nothing
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
The difference between me and you is(yeah)
I’d rather get money and try and flip me something
You can’t tell me nothing (nah)
The difference between me and you is (is what?)
You’d rather sit on your ass (okay)
Begging from another man holding out your hand
The difference between me and you (is what?)
Is I would never love her
I would never trust her(I swear I won't)
And she tell me that the difference between me and you (what the difference nigga?)
Is I’m go get a nigga, I swear like hell I go get a nigga

[Verse 1]
I was up all night counting them benjamins (I swear I was)
Haters eavesdropping say they saw me in the Benz (I see you nigga)
Bitch you guilty until proven innocent (get back hoe)
She wanna fuck with me so she can get these benefits
Hoe I ain’t stupid I ain’t crazy
Must be out of your mind (fuck you mean)
Know I got my back and I ain’t talking spine, no vertebrae
But I heard you say that you and me
You see the difference is there could never be
Two of me (nah)
I swear they phony they tryna clone me
Whatever just to be me (they trying though)
Get the racks that came with my Ray Bans
Cause these niggas can't see me
I told the ATM to feed me 20’s
Cause that’s all you can get when you get plenty
Rich homie baby

And she tell me that the difference between me and you (what the difference nigga?)
Is I’m go get a nigga, I swear like hell I go get a nigga

[Verse 2]
The difference is, I pay attention (yeah)
Whatever I say they listen
I’ma idol pay attention
I ain’t seen 'em in a minute
Teasing, gotta pay a visit (I see you)
And I get stupid on these tracks some say I’m ig'nant
Got em sayin' Quan getting it
But you know my palm itching
Label talking two mill, tell them folk come on with it
I know what the difference is see me I’ma foreign whip it
Show em what the business is, I got a office and my phone ringing
I inhale and my nose bleeding
Smoked the whole zip for no reason
Two doors but got four people, backstreets and we slow creeping
Oh, okay, aye bring them guns out them bullets make you run fast
Venn diagram compare and contrast(nigga)
