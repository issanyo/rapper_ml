(RHQ talking)
Yeah, hmm, this here is a true story
So Just listen

(clears throat)

(Bridge)

When your fam don't love ya, and there's no where to run to
I need me a shoulder, just to lean on and talk to
These ain't no scars on my shoulders, tattoos cover war wounds
I can't live forever, cause I know I gotta go soon

(Verse 1)

They say death around the corner, so I know they wanna kill me
Tryna stay alive I gotta see my lil boy touch his first million
(Yeah, yeah, heeey)
I know how it feel, to go without a meal, stayed down now I got that
Money stacked to the ceiling, had to break you off
Now I got the bitches wit the panies, take'em off
Money, made a whole lot, these niggas soft
Charmin tissue, Charmin tissue (heey)
Charmin tissue, Charmin tissue (oooh oh)
Do you know how it feel to grow up without nothin, nigga I ain't never thought about college
Fuck I look like going to college, I ain't even like high school
I got high everyday in high school
Im me who the fuck are you to prove
How the fuck you expect me to trust you
What the fuck am I to do when ya

(Bridge+Hook)

Fam don't love ya, and there's no where to run to
I need me a shoulder, just to lean on and talk to
These ain't no scars on my shoulders, tattoos cover war wounds
I can't live forever, cause I know I gotta go soon
God told me make today better than yesterday
God told me make today better than yesterday
God told me, I swear that, God told me, I know
(Heeey, heeey, hey, hey, hey, hey!)

(Verse 2)

I pray my soul to keep before I go to sleep and
I pray that God, watch over me in these streets man
I can't trust these niggas, so I sleep wit heat, damn
My niggas at your head, control, alt, and delete your man
I am not talkin bout a keyboard nigga
Feelin like Zelta, bought me a sword nigga
I was little, wanted some more nigga
I was down, she was supportin nigga
And I love her for that, no one above her for that
Nobody, nobody nobody, nobody nobody
Money talk, bullshit walk, tie your shoes
I ain't going broke, I ain't you
Why it seem like

(Bridge+Hook+Outro)

Your fam don't love ya, and there's no where to run to
I need me a shoulder, just to lean on and talk to
These ain't no scars on my shoulders, tattoos cover war wounds
I can't live forever, cause I know I gotta go soon
God told me make today better than yesterday
God told me make today better than yesterday
God told me, I swear that, God told me, I know
(God, told, me)
God told me make today better than yesterday
Make today better than yesterday, please
Every night, I drop down to my knees
