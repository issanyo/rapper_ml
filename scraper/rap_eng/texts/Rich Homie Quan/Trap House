[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
Pistol on me, they say I shot him
Blood on the floor, shout out to the red bottoms
My car got that dope, surveillance camera be watchin'
Every move you niggas make
That's why that trap house keep 'em shottas
I say that trap house do number everyday
I say that trap house do number everyday
I say that trap house do number everyday
I say that trap house do number everyday

[Verse 1: Offset]
Trap house doin' numbers, baking soda formulas
Gotta keep hammer that for my armor
I heard you fuck niggas out here snitchin' you are informin'
Trap house full of bricks but my couch is Louis V garments
Your bitch say that I'm charmin' that's cuz of all these charms
Saddam, I got bombs, got more green than a farm
There go Quan checkin' and tellin' me that the kush smellin' like oranges
Money bigger than enormous, groupie bitches still ignore us
G5 still tourin, y'all niggas ain't important
Money in my hand like ointment, Giuseppe costs 10 pairs of Jordans
You niggas wanna be Rich Homies, but do not have enough money
Leopard I'm dress like Jumanji, trappin' and cappin', nothing turn to something
Offset!

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Trap house have 'em stupid prices
I don't know what you want, I'mma let you decide it
Nigga they can come on they own, they ain't gotta be invited
Cuz they the main a reason why a nigga on
They call me your highness, and they ain't gotta do that
They treat me different that's definition of a real nigga who gettin' it
I got extra bitches no special bitches, can't show these hoes no attention
Back on your bitch start feelin' herself, worryin' ' 'bout me, she killin' herself
Tellin' your friends you ain't needin' no help, but every time I see your hand out for the wealth
Bitch is you crazy, I gotta get back to the trap spot, left two and a baby
Your girl with the swag cookin', making drugs so pure like the 80s
Trap spot still goin' crazy, hotbox I'm pullin' out daily
Even though I made it, still walk around with that--
