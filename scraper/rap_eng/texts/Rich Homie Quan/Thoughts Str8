[Hook]
I'm sippin hard liquor to get my thoughts straight
Road blocked jumping fences when the cops chase
Got cognac in my cup dont know how scotch taste
I told lil shawty dont get it twisted dreadlock babe
Grinding getting money nightfall to morning
We gone knock that boy off while we touring
Barely at the telly, hundred to the doorman
Money on them bitches head I got it storming

[Verse 1]
I look myself in the mirror said "that money won't change"
Im tryna buy a bigger house so there'd be no more complaining
My money good my lawyer straight gotta throw it out of the ring
You better believe it boy we leaving the same way that we came
If a nigga disrespect me then he might not be breathing
Alot of red flags around me everybody they bleeding
They know I got it out the streets I wrote my name in the city
And everytime I go to sleep im still fighting them demons
Count them backends with my road dog
Like a naked bitch dont make homie expose y'all
When i smoke that weed i get closed off
If I wouldve kept popping molly I would be throwed off

[Hook]
I'm sippin hard liquor to get my thoughts straight
Road blocked jumping fences when the cops chase
Got cognac in my cup dont know how scotch taste
I told lil shawty dont get it twisted dreadlock bhave
Grinding getting money nightfall to morning
We gone knock that boy off while we touring
Barely at the telly, hundred to the doorman
Money on them bitches head I got it storming

[Verse 2]
Hard to realize what I been going through lately
Girl you stayed down through all the controversy
They throwing shade bih they Maybach it come with curtains
So I ain't worrying bout whay they saying or what they doing dawg
Sacrifice way too much just to lose it all
If Quan name come up you know my whole crew involved
Point guard and I might move the ball
Im way behind the line might shoot em off
Yall niggas lame yall dont know what id do to y'all
Shawty play her part move the raw
Run up on me let that ruger blow
Bad bitches I need like two of those
Im tryna fuck her but she do the most

[Hook]
I'm sippin hard liquor to get my thoughts straight
Road blocked jumping fences when the cops chase
Got cognac in my cup dont know how scotch taste
I told lil shawty dont get it twisted dreadlock babe
Grinding getting money nightfall to morning
We gone knock that boy off while we touring
Barely at the telly, hundred to the doorman
Money on them bitches head I got it storming
