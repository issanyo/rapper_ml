[Verse 1]
They throwin' rocks and hide their hands I ain't surprised
I don't stand in traps I no longer supervise
I thank God every night before I close my eyes
Beefin' with them niggas shot at 'em like 3 times
If I'm wrong then I don't wanna be right
Got my phone in the back of my Levi's
And I still don't trust no bitch 'cause at the end she lied
I got these 100s in the safe stacked up knee high
Fuckin' hoes gettin' old, gettin' money ain't new
Shawty thinkin' I'ma business man 'cause she seen homie in a suit
Top drop at anytime need a GPS for the roof
And I don't really like no nigga who talk a lot rather show me what you gon' do
Parallel in the parking lot I'm rollin' smoked out in the coupe
Got these 100 dollar bills in rubber bands 'cause I don't like to carry money loose
Got a couple bands on these niggas' head if I say the word they gon' shoot
And I ain't beefin' with no nigga 'bout no bitch to me that ain't cool
It's too much money to be made out here yeah
Gotta keep my gun it ain't safe out here
Been stayin' down can't show my face 'round here
And I ain't trippin' cut the lights out
Got this cross on my chest and you know it's iced out

[Hook]
Heart cold ice box
Eyes closed, lights out
Chicago White Sox
Talk hard pipe down
Shootin' shit head target
Dead fresh red carpet
I can't hear you nigga money in the way say it louder
Talk loud nah nigga
Money in the wall with a tracker on the phone just in case you wanna call a nigga
I'm paranoid, geeked up
I see dead people, I see you before you comin' I'm lookin' through the peephole

[Verse 2]
The G code yeah you know I'm stickin' to it
Turn the volume up on these headphones I wanna listen to it
Keep the chopper, yea in the back man and let the pistol do it
Can't close my eyes gotta face my fear just grip and do it
Stick and move you know I'm stickin' to what we planned
He sick of losin' I heard he spent all of his advance
Feel like a movie I walked in feelin' just like the man
On every move I hit I make sure I had my mans
Right hand truth if I swear I will never take the stand
I swear I shoot just look at the blisters on my hand
Shine bright, headlight                                                                           I gotta make the transaction if you got the bread right
This cross make me feel alive

[Hook]
Heart cold ice box
Eyes closed, lights out
Chicago White Sox
Talk hard pipe down
Shootin' shit head target
Dead fresh red carpet
I can't hear you nigga money in the way say it louder
Talk loud nah nigga
Money in the wall with a tracker on the phone just in case you wanna call a nigga
I'm paranoid, geeked up
I see dead people, I see you before you comin' I'm lookin' through the peephole

[Outro]
Heart cold ice box
Eyes closed, lights out
Talk hard pipe down
I can't hear you nigga money in the way say it louder
Money in the wall with a tracker on the phone just in case you wanna call a nigga
I see dead people, I see dead people
