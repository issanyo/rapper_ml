[Chorus: YG]
I said that I'm a ride for my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'm a die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grinding outside, all day with my niggas
And I ain't going in, unless I'm with my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My motherfucking niggas!)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga


[Verse 1: Von Tae']
Fuck that bullshit that they talking, I ain't talking bout no niggas
These niggas faking like hard but they ain't pulling triggers
They speak with so much ignorance, that’s why I spit belligerent
Rappin’ with a vengeance, fuck a friendship cause I’m killin it
Solo, dolo groupie’s tryna take a photo
Yo hoe, looking for the dick like Marco Polo
I swerve on a nigga, I curve on a nigga
Keep my circle small so the fucking squares don’t enter
Pretentious ass niggas, when I do this shit by habit
Married to the music, you live yo shit in co-habit
Silly rabbit, you heard that trix are for kids
These niggas, could never ever keep up with the league that I’m in
Cause I ain't never stunting round with fake niggas
Catch me in the streets with a couple bad bitches
Do this shit everyday like it’s my own religion
Man its game time, nigga stay on ya pivot (nigga)

These niggas ain't' shit
Its just me, myself and I
So when you hear me say my nigga
I’m looking in the mirror


[Chorus: YG]
I said that I'm a ride for my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'm a die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grinding outside, all day with my niggas
And I ain't going in, unless I'm with my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My motherfucking niggas!)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga
