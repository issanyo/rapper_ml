[Intro]
Zaytoven
I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing but the streets

[Hook]
I ain't know nothing 'bout no drank until the age of 13
I ain't know nothing 'bout no money 'til the age of 14
I ain't know nothing 'bout no condom 'til the age of 15
And I ain't never go to class as a teen
I ain't dumb, but I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing but the streets

[Verse 1]
17 was the worst, feel like I ain't had no purpose
At 18 was workin'
At 18 was lurkin'
At 18 I graduated, a lotta lames in my class, I know they mad I made it
I keep my phone on silent because it aggravates me
And I protect my paper like it's laminated
Contaminated, I can't even touch the water
I damaged faces and I'm all on his lil daughter
No cancer patient but you know a nigga ballin'
I'ma keep goin' all then like I was in Charlotte

[Hook]
I ain't know nothing 'bout no drank until the age of 13
I ain't know nothing 'bout no money 'til the age of 14
I ain't know nothing 'bout no condom 'til the age of 15
And I ain't never go to class as a teen
I ain't dumb, but I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing but the streets

[Verse 2]
Okay, now age 21, I spent locked up
22, came home told myself no more gettin' back locked up
Came home focused, new mind frame, knew nothing could stop us
By 23 my baby momma she was knocked up
Where you think double R come from?
That Royal Rich my second son
Tryna do the best for them
So they ain't gotta go through what I used to do when I was breakin' in houses
I was tryna make a better life for them (I swear)
And I succeeded at that
At 24 had 10 cars, I thought a Beamer was next
My nigga, 'My Nigga,' went platinum, I received me a plaque
By 25 years million I had maybe like 5 more man I ain't done yet
Thanks to the streets

I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing but the streets
I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing but the streets
