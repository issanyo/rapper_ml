[Intro]
I'm in the green room
I see The Wash looking at me
This money talking to me
(Hold Up, Spiffy on this motherfucker)
Mannn

[Hook]
Diamonds dancing, jewelry from overseas
I feel like Adam Sandler, Big Daddy is all she need
You can call me Tyson Chandler, I'm blocking hoes I don't need
I'm in her head like some cancer, naw better yet some Aleve
I got her mind racing
I got her mind racing
Rolex I'm never time wasting
I gave you yours, I need mine baby
Uh huhh

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quann]
Bankroll gotta change clothes cause a nigga feel dirty
My same bros fucking them same hoes had to tell them that shit ain't worth it
I got the young hoe holding her ankle while I'm tearing off in her surface
Imma beat that pussy then tell that hoe you ain't nowhere near perfect

Cleaner than Lysol fuck her with the lights off cause lil' shawty say that she nervous
When she want the lights on just to see my python but you can't see this snake in public
You just some to dine on gave the hoe a iPhone bitch looked at me and said nigga this nothing
Riding with my lights on I ain't got time for a nigga like me to fuck around get and bused
I call her Jolly, I don't like nothing but hard candy
What we call Molly? Hard Candy
Show her a thousand dollars I bet that she start dancing
I had over a thousand problems til' they got handled
Now I got my!
