[Hook: Gorilla Zoe]
You pop them pills
You sip that mud
You a bad bitch
You fuck with thugs
You bout your money, that's wassup
You don't want love, you want to fuck
I say I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
That pussy good, that ass so fat
You get it up, they callin' back
You got good head, you bout your bread
Them niggas stalkin', gonna slap
I say I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know

[Verse 1: Gorilla Zoe]
She say fuck her baby daddy, he ain't 'bout shit anyway
Got a nigga on the side, and he play for NBA
I said what you think she trainin for?
She got that waste trainor on or whatever he payin' for
I said she killin' 'em, she killin' 'em
Lil bitch done caught a body
Bad bitch and she slammed on 'em, she walk in the party
200 on the mani' and she ride for him
Coco or Chanel-e, not the tutor on horn
Everybody follow her on Instagram
But she lowkey, cause she got a man
On the low she ain't trippin' cause he ain't a man
She got plenty hoes, it like she the man

[Hook: Gorilla Zoe]
You pop them pills
You suck that mud
You up that bitch
You fuck with thugs
You bout your money, that's wassup
You don't want love, you want to fuck
I say I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
That pussy good, that ass so fat
You get it up, they callin' back
You got good head, you bout your bread
Them niggas stalkin', gonna slap
I say I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
I got them honchos in my hair
Had a Balmain on my pants, I know
Cartier bracelet, I know
Pullin' up flexin'
I done walked in like the man
I just took 100 Zans, I snore
Can't fall asleep, I know
Watch out for these niggas
They talkin' through the pillar
With my Zoes in Miami
Thuggin' with guerrillas
I dropped a 4 in my juice
I want some more of the juice
Pull up on you, drive slow in the coupe
Hides behind him but I know that it's you
Pull up on my nigga ridin'
Ay, swervin'
I don't mind if you dirty
I walk around with that pistol and I'm a (?)
Hold up boy I don't know the hook
Gorilla tell 'em

[Hook: Gorilla Zoe]
You pop them pills

You up that bitch
You fuck with thugs
You bout your money, that's wassup
You don't want love, you want to fuck
I say I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
That pussy good, that ass so fat
You get it up, they callin' back
You got good head, you bout your bread
Them niggas stalkin', gonna slap
I say I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
