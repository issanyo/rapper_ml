[Intro]
Im blessed like a muhfucka man. You feel me
Real talk bro
I got the big homie Rocko over here
Its that muhfuckin OG to me

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
Her number 1 i need a medal for it
I use similes and metaphors
Get Chicago head when im in Illinois
Gotta go hard for my little boys
Im tired of playing with these little boys if im off Thursday i hit Lecora
She want attention so i give her more and im bout my business long as its important
Slot machine yeah i need a quarter
Poppin beans and im giving orders
I ain't pleading cause i got a lawyer
But i bleeding like a red soldier
I remember when we stayed in the apartments and i just keep telling these niggas i came a long way from the Driveway
(You know I did) Came a long way from the Driveway
I came a long way, Came a long way
Now im a millionaire, Came a long way from the Driveway
Now im up nigga, Came a long way from the Driveway

[Verse 1:Rocko]
Had to leave the bottom of the barrel ain't had no business there
Do anything get from down there i dont give a damn cause i ain't never cared
All i know my grandaddy died ain't get to see him
They looking for at the funeral Its sticking out of his spirit yo im like damn this shit that serious though
No way this shit is that serious
My bad for my run on sentences but i hate periods all i want is commas, on my mama
Ima go hard as i can stack a hundred thousand thousand grand thats a hundred M ain't it
I can everybody dream come true with them can't i
Gotta get my life right the chances we take tryna get that sack right
Lord knows i been tryna act right
Damn i wanna rewrite my wrongs
(fuck it) Fuck it life goes on, i just write these songs. A1
