[Intro]
Aye Meek!
They don't know about all that new shit
You feel me?
They don't know about the new car
They don't know about the new spot
They don't know it
They don't know the half

[Chorus]
New whip, new rear, cut my old bitch off
Got Brand new everything
New shit, new gun, New plug on the lean
Got Brand new medicine
New spot, new drop, new watch, new Glock
Shooting at fuck niggas who irrelevant
New shirt, new hat, new jacket
Can't forget about the Brand New leather pants
Brand new, that hoe I'm fucking, brand new
Them new blue hummer, brand new
Foreign Car bought from Russia, brand new
That bitch you cuffin' brand new
That money I'm  stuffin' brand new
This pistol I'm tucking, brand new
Brand new
Brand New
Brand New
Brand New
Brand New
Brand New

[Verse 1]

These lame niggas flexin'
Talking 'bout that car you riding in, brand new nigga
Who you think you testing? (Not Me)
I ain't never been a killer
I'll damn sho' shoot a nigga
Listen up I gotta question:
Why these young niggas talk shit through a message?
Is it cause I'm rich?
Why you hating on my blessing?
Probably cause yo bitch on me, got you stressing
Nigga, face it, Nigga you basic
Nigga broke ass nigga
Can't afford brand new
Fake ass nigga can't stand by you
We can fight lil nigga
Show you what these hands do
I got 4 or 5 nigga hanging out the van shootin'
4 or 5 bitches best believe they came through
Managed to the money, Go to Onyx on Tuesday
It's a lot of niggas, add 'em up
It'll be a new movie
Model bitch I'm fucking, brand new
A lot of clothes, and the cars are brand new
A 100 bands, two days, ran through
Ran off on ya ass, I ain't have to pay you
All the bands in the van, choppas in the back
Got the Glock in my hand, and I got another 105 in the stash
I'm talkin' 'bout 500 cash, 200 on the dash
Can't forget about you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

Brand New money
Brand New Prada
Brand New diamond, looking like water
A nigga got a baby on the way
I'm finna be a brand new father (I'm finna be a dad)
Brand new mac, Brand new Rari'
Brand new spreef, Polo boxers
May know me, I don't know about you
2 condo's, and 3 houses (I got three niggas)
Brand new bitch, Brand new fit
I'm at the mall 'bout to buy some brand new kicks
Spend it on your broad
Buy nothin' but brand new shit (aye)
Got brand new money
Old money stashed in the basement
Fuck nigga must be a mute
When I ask a question pussy nigga never ever say shit
Got locked up with a brand new nigga, he gon' cooperate
Then write a statement, If I ain't want to go to school
I'll place it
EVerything that I do gotta make sense
I gotta pool in the back with a gate fence
I remember when I noticed I had late rent
I remember I ain't have shit
And I got that hater mad at me cause I pulled up

[Chorus]

[Outro]

Ya'll niggas got life fucked up man
You feel me?
Ain't nan nigga round me brand new
They been fucking with me
I'm tryna fuck that hoe!
Understand me?
Understand me?
Understand me?
I told you
Rich Homie Baby
Rich Homie Baby
Rich Homie Baby
Brand New, Brand New
Everything I got on brand new
Everything I got on brand new
Fuck that hoe 3 times
Then I gotta find some brand new
Heard what he said?
