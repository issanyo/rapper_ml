[Intro]
I did lost a lotta shit man
I dun lost partners, bitches, money
But I ain’t never lost my mind though
You feel me?

[Chorus]
I lost a couple partners
When I thought shit couldn’t go wrong (but it did)
Can I get a witness
Cause everybody got problem
And you don’t know where to go
Alot of these bitches weak minded
But you gotta learn how to be strong
And when it feels like you lost everything
Ay gotta hold on, you
You gotta you gotta hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on

[Verse 1]
Started losing my mind, who am i to trust (can't trust nobody)
Start abusing the grind, now a nigga up (I'm up)
Telling bitches I know it ain’t mine I ain’t even fuck (get back hoe)
But i admit i got sucked, real good
On the hood, on my homies in the hood they hungry
And I’m good, I don’t want it (nah)
Cuz she belong to the homie (rich homie baby)
And I’m riding in a car that ain’t out yet, boy I’m hitting gas
And my dick where her mouth at, boy you know the homie done smash
Swear you know the homie got cash (got money girl)
And everybody still got problems (they do)
But what the fuck am I pose to do if they mad (I don't know)
I’m popping percocets to keep cautious
Too many percs I mean nauseous, ain't’ tryna see a hearse or no coffin
Problem, I got a problem, and i call that bit my chopper (chopper)
All them, yeah all them I shoot this shit at all them (fa fa fa)
And I do this shit for all of them (who?)
Nigga locked up, nigga dead and gone
Drinking a forty at the graveyard cuz

[Chorus]
I lost a couple partners
When I thought shit couldn’t go wrong (but it did)
Can I get a witness
Cause everybody got problem
And you don’t know where to go
Alot of these bitches weak minded
But you gotta learn how to be strong
And when it feels like you lost everything
Ay gotta hold on, you
You gotta you gotta hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on

[Verse 2]
Got a grip on life when I got out of jail, got right (had to get some money nigga)
I was breakin' in houses I wouldn’t touch no scale no white(I was breakin' in houses)
But i been in them houses, been around that shit all my life (all my life)
God make no mistake if I had a chance wouldn't do it twice
Stayed down ain't come over night
Spray rounds I ain’t tryin to fight (fa fa)
Stay ground got a nigga right
It's possible baby, no lie (no lie)
As with myself I keep going hard, but I don’t know why (I don't know why)
You dont know my bitch yeah she foreign
Got her from Hawaii (overseas)
I walked in by myself dare one of y'all niggas to try me (do something)
I pulled up like a hearse with a hundred cars behind me
Siamese, twin what I called her matchin’ Forties
Find me in that big body Benz no more scotty
I told my partner no more robbin’
‘cause I heard them people watchin'
My Florida ho call me "Papi"
We in Florida so many options (so many options nigga)
Nigga bite me, I know they teeth hurt
I'm tired of all these rest in peace shirts but

[Chorus]
I lost a couple partners
When I thought shit couldn’t go wrong (but it did)
Can I get a witness
Cause everybody got problem
And you don’t know where to go
Alot of these bitches weak minded
But you gotta learn how to be strong
And when it feels like you lost everything
Ay gotta hold on, you
You gotta you gotta hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
