Hook:
Look At All This Time We Invested, Before We Made It Official We
Was Bestfriends
You Care Bout Me More Then I Care Bout Me , That's Selfish
Got To Put My Heart In It & Try Not To Regret S**t
You Listened To Me When I Felt Like No One Else Did
Way Before "Nene" We Was Pulling Up At The Westend
I Need A 100 Million Dollars Nun Less Then (For Ya Heart Shawty)
Cuz Money Can't Buy Love


Verse:
(Rich Homie Quan)
It's Some Memories, We created We Can't Frame Them
Moved Out Mama House, Got You Pregnant In The Same Year/
Got Caught Cheating So Many Times , I Ain't The Same Now
My Ex's Mad Cuz I'm In Love Bay And They Ain't Here/
You Watch Me Transform From A Boy To A Grown Man
Do What Ever I Got To Do For You To Make Them H**s Mad/
U Know My Old Lady & Bay Know I'm Your Old Man
& I Can Really Give A Damn Bout What Them H**s Saying/
You Saw Me At The Bottom Bay When I Was Starving
When I Ain't Have A Pot To Piss In Or A Toilet/
I Would Still Buy It If I Could Not Afford It
& You Was Still There When I Wasn't Important/
You Got Something Nobody Got
You Got The Key To My Heart/
And Can't Nobody Get Your Spot
This What It Is That What It Was/

Verse 2:
(Yung D.i. Verse)
Stressed Out Bout Your Love I Need Some Counseling
I Been Smoking All Day I'm Talking Ounces/
Can't Put A Price On Your Love Like A Bounty
They Tied A Brick Around Your Heart And Tried To Drown It/
We 60 Floors In The Air Feel Like A 1,000
I Get That P***y Tare It Down Like Old Houses/
Before I Let Em Sleep On Us I Buy Em Couches
Money Can't Buy Love But It Can Keep The Hate From
Round It/
I Was Dead Broke , You Held It Down Like A Deadbolt
We Was Back To Back An In & Out It Like A echo /
Even Doe I Cheated 3 Times You Just Let It Go
Told Me If I Ever Cheat Again You'll Be Gone So/
I Got To Clean Up My Act Like A Janitor
We Invested All This Time Check The Calendar/
I Keep You Put Up Like Pea's In The Cabinet
I Want Your Love , I Won't Let No One Have It/
