[Hook]
I say she different from them other girls
And I don't witness her drive of the world
Made some decisions ain't my fault if I get hurt
And I know I'm gon get what I deserve

[Verse 1]
Sup homie thank a nigga [?] (what)
[?] number two position still wanna be (be quiet ho)
Aussies talking shit but I can't hear
Stupid bitch I might just leave, I'm serious
I do it all for you

(transcribing)
