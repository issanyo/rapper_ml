[ Intro ]

Rich Homie Quan
Yeaa
Real Nigga Music Man
Real Niggas Stand up

[Chorus]

I smoke a blunt for my niggas who dead
Getting tired of writing these letter
To my niggas who gone
Most of 'em hustling, surviving in jail
Get teardrops from another body
Just to come Home
I told my niggas we don't hurt nomo (I mean it)
Told my mama she ain't gotta work nomo (I mean it)
Mind yo business hoe my curtains closed (I mean it)
The naked truth will get her, exposed
And I mean it
I mean it
I mean it

[Verse 1]

I don't stutter so
Everything I say I mean
I just murder folks
I'on flex when I say I lean (Drink Nigga)
And I just caught a hoe
On chess board I swear she Queen
Or ask Alicia (I ain't Swiss Beats)
Know that's a Keys (Nah Nigga)
Them folks be taking pictures
Why they after me?
Was told don't play with pistols (Nah)
Target [?]
And I mean everything I say
With emphasis (Rich Homie Baby)
And I mean nan nigga ain't safe (Nah)
And I'm serious
I'm fenning
All the hoes on safe, Ridiculous
My team?
Yea nigga we straight, with them benefits
Got licenses by the dealership
Turn the mic up
They ain't hearing this
Real nigga music

[Chorus]
