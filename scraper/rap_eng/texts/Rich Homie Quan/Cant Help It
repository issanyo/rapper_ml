[Intro: Rich Homie Quan]
You know I can't help this shit man, It's in me
But if I could, you know I would, Rich Homie Baby!!

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan, $.J.R]
I can't help it who I am, I can't help it who I know
I can't help the fact these bitches trying to fuck me every show
I can't help cuz I'm getting money and my dream has just begun
I can't help the fact I'd rather put this kush inside my lungs
(I can't help it) I can't help it who I am!
(I swear that I can't help it) can't help it who I am!
(I swear that I can't help it) can't help it who I am!
(I can't help it who I am and I hate the fact I'm famous)

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Ok now I'm finally famous told my mama no more stressing
My closet on thanks giving kill em' with the dressing
Even If I add extra, boy you watch your mind frame
I can make her bed rock, Straight head shots
And I ain't talking about no mind games
I know his Ray Bans Fake because they ain't how mine came (Them ain't real nigga!)
I got my nikes tied, Money what I taste
And I'm blazed so Michael Phelps me!
I'm so great can't help it
It's so fucked up I need counseling!!
And who gone vouch for me? O.G.'s and them real niggas!
I know drug dealers who really kill niggas!
My death date coming and I ain't scared to go
Bitches calling my name like everywhere I go!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: $.J.R]
Yeah

No Ray Bans(Naw), These super shades
Gold frames, Fish Bowl
I switch it out, Even your bitch know!
I'm rich homie like Quan, I can't help this shit I'm on
(I can't Help it) I'm Flexing!
(I can't Help it) These Diamonds in my necklace!

They mad at me, Cuz I'm famous

Just ask about me, Bitch I do that!
