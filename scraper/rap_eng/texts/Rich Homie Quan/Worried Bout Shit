[Hook:]
You can sit back with your feet laid up
In the penthouse suite, you ain't gotta worry 'bout shit
I'mma go out, get the dough, after that, get some more
To make sure that you ain't worried 'bout shit
Baby, where the money at? added? where the dough?
Make sure you ain't ever gotta worry 'bout shit
Put that on my momma and I put that on my daddy
Swear to God, baby, you ain't ever gotta worry 'bout shit

[Verse:]
I ain't worried 'bout shit cuz a nigga like me ain't got too much to lose
I ain't got no point to prove, catch his ass slippin' been in overtime to shoot
I be still catchin' Charlie, cuz I'm still crazy
I might pull up on you and then go like Patrick Swayze
Told that bitch to cum thought I was talking masturbation, but I won
Niggas talkin' to the police investigatin', ho know what I'm doin'
Whole lotta gula, lots of paper, you know I run it up
You just sit down nigga, pussy niggas stand it up
I got money to the ceiling, I got lots of hoes, cuz I don't got no feelings
Call me Mr. Polar, all I know is dealer
Since I went solo, these niggas In their feelings, ya feel me?
All I'm tryna get is money, tryna stack a couple dollar all to feed my family
Got some B.E.T awards now it's time for a Grammy
I still do it for my mamma, shouts out to Tammy
I had  to let her know
