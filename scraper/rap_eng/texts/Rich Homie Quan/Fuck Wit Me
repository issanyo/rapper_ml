[Intro]
Stoopid
Yeah, yeah, oooh, oooh
Yeah, aye, you know that money don’t make you real, right? Ha, that shit just define the person you are, ya feel me? Real nigga since day one man, aye

[Chorus]
I gotta give my all once again, gotta put my heart in this shit
Get up if I fall once again, save it up all, don’t spend
First thing I bought was the Bent, let me talk my shit
I been working hard on my craft
Long sleeve shirt, boy you know it's something up my sleeve
And I ain’t ever going out bad
Middle finger up, boy you know you can’t fuck with me

[Verse 1]
I could never let that bullshit you do get to me
Charge a nigga for the game, I be givin’ him some fee
Too much finger when I bang I throw up a bigger B
Swear my life is like a puzzle, I need a missing piece (hey)
The more hater that I get, boy that paper increase
The more money that I spend, the more friends decrease
Face card good, we were somewhere eating free
Smokin’ good gas, pump five, BP (yeah)
Neighborhood stop sign, we was in the street (yeah)
Still goin’ in top five, mention me (yeah)
Better clock in, you don’t work, you don’t eat (yeah)
I got old money, put up boy, stop playin’ wit me (lil' nigga)
We were takin’ everything, playin’ for keeps (lil' bitch)
You never been a boss, you not the man to me (Quan)
Talkin’ money, yeah a hundred grand is cheap to me (that right too nigga)

[Chorus]
I gotta give my all once again, gotta put my heart in this shit
Get up if I fall once again, save it up all, don’t spend
First thing I bought was the Bent, let me talk my shit
I been working hard on my craft
Long sleeve shirt, boy you know it's something up my sleeve
And I ain’t ever going out bad
Middle finger up, boy you know you can’t fuck with me

[Verse 2]
If I was color blind, I would still talk green baby (yeah)
Money talk, Chris Tucker, Charlie Sheen baby (yeah)
Would come flip a chicken but you know that we gravy (yeah)
Gotta scream my shawty name out Walgreens baby (Quan)
Spray a nigga just like arsene baby (woo)
Dead people, I got all these faces (aye)
Passport stamp, I done went all these places (what)
Lawyer paid off, she done won all these cases (my nigga)
Dead white men in my pocket, I’m not racist
Turned my dreams into reality, never thought I would make it
Have another kid that motivation
Momma house, I got it in in the basement
Wasn’t no rushin’ on money 'cause we were patient
Can’t do it backward 'cause then that wouldn’t make sense
Trap doin’ numbers, got another sold
Send a U-Haul on the way wit another load

[Chorus]
I gotta give my all once again, gotta put my heart in this shit
Get up if I fall once again, save it up all, don’t spend
First thing I bought was the Bent, let me talk my shit
I been working hard on my craft
Long sleeve shirt boy you know it's something up my sleeve
And I ain’t ever going out bad
Middle finger up boy you know you can’t fuck with me

[Outro]
I told yall niggas man
Ain’t shit changed but the extra zeroes in the bank account nigga haha
I’m so stressed out, I’m smokin’ cigarettes now man
