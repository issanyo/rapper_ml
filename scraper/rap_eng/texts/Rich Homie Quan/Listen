[Verse]
Jumped out the porch
I ain't have nothing
When i was poor
They was laughin at me
Now im on them billboards
And im laughing at em
I give you my heart
You can have it baby
It was cool at first and it's been a little dramatic lately
It was me and you at first, it's been me and your family lately
Why throw my name in the dirt
Like what happened baby
Make up sex make her hurt
Ride this saddle baby
Close them no muslim, but asamalekoum
Cuz them my cousins a get something shaking
The oven baking
Let them motherfucker on 350
Ain't counting my days, feel like ive been on the road for 350
Days nigga
Aye
Im paid nigga
Hey
Ain't tell you bout the house that i got with that lay
And the backyard nigga act hard nigga
I will pull your card nigga
Play
With me thats some niggas who will lay
On you that you stay
Nigga i ain't play on the ground all you hatin niggas
Like a jesus piece, no, I ain't playing with you
If a bitch a freak i ain't even lay with her
Used to hit a lick just to make a couple bands nigga
Ay ayeeee Talk a lil louder I ain’t hearin what you sayin nigga
Did a couple walk thru's made a lot of bands nigga
I ain't tryna talk to you, if you ain't talking cash nigga
Money, like Usher
I got the bad nigga, bad nigga
Michael Jackson bad nigga, bad nigga
Aye leather jacket on yeah I’m that nigga
I was born in the 80s like the crack nigga (aye) 7x
Never heard of Atari play games on em
Never drove in the Ferrari switching lanes on em
Damien Wayne that’s a shame on em
Big booty freak , the bitch tatted my name on it
I heard them niggas hating y'all the same homies
Since the niggas claim they hot I set some flames on em
Real Nigga what you thought we ain’t lame homie
Skinny jeans see the knot and the thang on me
Bang Bang Pow there go one of yall niggas
If I aim at y'all ian missing one of you niggas
Creep in your house like Clause, I ain't using no chimney
Like the 24th of December, I'mma make you niggas remember
Them Christmas Eve’s ian had shit
Was a beginner , em open mics they was laughing
Now I’m spending so much money
They ain't asking no question bout my bitch cause she the baddest
I been on the road, yeah I seen a lot of hoes
At the end of every rainbow is there a pot of gold?
Want to hold you in my hand, want you under my control
For selling the city girl I want to tell the globe
Ran off my money now I'm tryna get some more
Bands to the ceiling I will stack it from the floor
And we got some off in the wall
Some more be hide the picture
Over the high 5 play behind law
Ian like the call empire he was our
Referee that’s a foul, gotta technical
Cause how hard a nigga ball
TMZ all in my business cause I fall , I meant fell
Born in October weighting on my scale
I ain’t tryna come over if I can not nail
This picture in your fame they bitching on my name
Rich Homie Baby
