[Intro: Omarion]
Rich Homie Quan
Omarion
And yo chick, yo chick

Somewhere in here there's a bad bitch that's been on my mind
She tried to talk but I missed it when she hit my line
I know I've been drinking a lot and I'm probably too high
If I hit it once then I probably could hit one more time

[Bridge: Omarion]
Cause her sex game on Beyoncé, cé
I think she drinking Bombay, ay
Don't take this the wrong way
I eat that sweet pwussy on a Sat'day

[Hook: Omarion]
I'm saying, might make her my fiancée
I'm saying, don't care what they gon' say
I'm saying, I give it to her long way
Bang bang when I hit her with the gunplay
Where are you?
(I'm saying) At the end of the night where you going?
(I'm saying) When it's all said and done is you rolling?
I'm saying
I'm saying
I'm saying, try'na hit her with the gunplay
I'm saying, try'na hit her with the gunplay

[Verse 1: Omarion]
Suicide, suicide Lamborghinis outside
Wanna ride? Wanna ride? We could run up on the line
Like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, head on my lap
So low, low, low, low, you remember that?
Baby, I'm a savage, you ain't fucking with the average
Sex game, I'm an addict, she ain't tripping off the status
Red light, green light, we can skip the foreplay
Left, right, she be going both ways

[Bridge: Omarion]
Sex game on Beyoncé, cé
I think she drinking Bombay, ay
Don't take this the wrong way
I eat that sweet pussy on a Sat'day

[Hook: Omarion]
I'm saying, might make her my fiancée
I'm saying, don't care what they gon' say
I'm saying, I give it to her long way
Bang bang when I hit her with the gunplay
Where are you?
(I'm saying) At the end of the night where you going?
(I'm saying) When it's all said and done is you rolling?
I'm saying (Tell 'em what you talking bout)
I'm saying (Omarion, you saying to 'em?)
I'm saying, try'na hit her with the gunplay
I'm saying, try'na hit her with the gunplay

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Pull up on that girl with her legs open
After she sucked my (mm), leave her head swollen
She just wanna (mm) with me for a little exposure
Tell me, do you fuck with me? Tell me, what's your motive?
Tell me why you do that shit you do to me
When you do it, girl you got a nigga feeling so bad
And I be feeling like Jay Z, you don't know why girl
Yeah you do, Quan

[Bridge: Omarion]
Sex game on Beyoncé, cé
I think she drinking Bombay, ya
Don't take this the wrong way
I eat that sweet pussy on a Sat'day

[Hook 2: Omarion & Rich Homie Quan]
I'm saying, other niggas get the pump fade
I'm saying, she don't care what they gon' say
I'm saying, I give it to her long way
Bang bang when I hit her with the gunplay
Where are you? (Tell me where you at)
At the end of the night where you going?
When it's all said and done is you rolling?
I'm saying (Tell 'em what you talking bout)
I'm saying (Omarion, you saying to 'em?)
I'm saying, try'na hit her with the gunplay
I'm saying, try'na hit her with the gunplay
