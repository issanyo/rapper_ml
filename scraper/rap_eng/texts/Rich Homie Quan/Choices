[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I-I made choices in the past
To get me where I'm at
I had to make choices in the past
To get me where I'm at
It ain't bout you, but it ain't bout me, Yeah
It's about that paper coming with green, Yeah
So much money it don't make sense no more, I'm saying
I'm at the point where I can't get no more, I-I-I'm playing
Around with a check so you can't fire me
Aye fuck a crew I'm tryna build a dynasty

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
I got my momma a new house, I got my daddy a new shop
Told my brother he can have any car off the lot
Got my sister out the hood so my nephew ain't gotta suffer
Got my side ho a spot just for somewhere else to fuck her
Got my grandma a new van cause she love them motherfuckers
Got some chairs for my haters, I can't stand them motherfuckers
Make you dance motherfucker, I swear that's what them bullets did
Steve Harley clean rolling white boys call them bullet heads
Ha these niggas be playing I swear they don't want it
No sleep, no zan. I'm on the molly geeked up to the next damn morning
And if you steal from me I'll kill you baby
Abortion they say life's all about choices

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I-I made choices in the past
To get me where I'm at
I had to make choices in the past
To get me where I'm at
It ain't bout you, but it ain't bout me, Yeah
It's about that paper coming with green, Yeah
So much money it don't make sense no more, I'm saying
I'm at the point where I can't get no more, I-I-I'm playing
Around with a check so you can't fire me
Aye fuck a crew I'm tryna build a dynasty

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
I-I-I keep my head straight, my bed made
I stay in touch with Billy Ray even though that fed case
Still pending on him I pray for him everyday
With a 2 million bond its best he play it safe
And I ain't scared to say a damn thing to the jury, ho
We was shooting a video how they robbed the jewelry store
And they still ain't got no witness
And I know it ain't none of y'all business
But I just want y'all to listen
And see how the system tryna fuck my nigga
F-Fucking life up, other niggas ain't like us
Morning Breathe better try Trident, don't try us
It's like a fan in the battle how I'm blowing dough
It ain't bout where you been, it's where your going homie

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I-I made choices in the past
To get me where I'm at
I had to make choices in the past
To get me where I'm at
It ain't bout you, but it ain't bout me, Yeah
It's about that paper coming with green, Yeah
So much money it don't make sense no more, I'm saying
I'm at the point where I can't get no more, I-I-I'm playing
