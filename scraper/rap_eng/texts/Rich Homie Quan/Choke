[Intro: Jules Winnfield]
And you will know I am the lord, when I lay my vengeance upon you. I been saying that shit for years, and if you heard it that meant yo ass. I never gave much thought to what it meant I just thought it was some cold blooded shit to say to a muthafucka before I popped a cap in his ass. I saw some shit this morning made me think twice. See now I'm thinking, maybe it means you're the evil man, and I'm the righteous man. And Mr. 9mm here is the shepard protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness

[Hook: Young Thug]
Nipsey, smoke that lil bitch
Take the cuban link off and choke that lil bitch
I'mma gon' expose that lil bitch
If you didn't know it nigga, now you know that lil bitch, hey!
You's a cocka roach ass lil bitch
I'mma take your head off and roll it, no rollin' bitch, hey!
Big B's on report card, right beside me is a whole lotta C's lord

[Hook 2: Nipsey Hussle + Rich Homie Quan]
Now you know, now you know
Black loccs, Neck gold
Now you know, now you know
Rich bangers, Death row
Now you know, now you know
Keep hammers, pockets bulge
Now you know, now you know
Yea, Yea
Now you know, now you know
Lil nigga, step off
Now you know, now you know
Fake bangers, Just pose
Now you know, now you know
Us niggas, snatch souls

[Verse 1: Young Thug + Nipsey Hu$$le]
Hold it, I'll eat you like a Krystal
All my jewelry showin' loud like a whistle
Hold it, know some bodies on my pistol
Woah, don't push me cause I'm a killer
Thug, gon' and smoke that lil bitch
Take the ruby robe off and choke that lil bitch
You shoulda known, no approaching this clique
Got the Damu riders and the Locs in this bitch
Don't spit out my baby, all my whips the latest
I know I'm the greatest, sorry but I'm taken
And my living room floor plan spacious
Niggas better stop playin', get to busting at they faces
I'll turn your goons into pieces and sell 'em overseas and
I ain't gonna tease her, sit on it like a bleacher
Send 'em to my Haitians in Miami, they gone heat 'em
Or I might send 'em to my Crips, let them defeat 'em
Shout out my niggas banging at the Four Seasons
That good drank got a skinny nigga eatin'
I gotta live, I could name 100 reasons, that I'm squeezin'

[Hook: Young Thug]
Nipsey, smoke that lil bitch
Take the cuban link off and choke that lil bitch
I'mma gon' expose that lil bitch
If you didn't know it nigga, now you know that lil bitch, hey!
You's a cocka roach ass lil bitch
I'mma take your head off and roll it, no rollin' bitch, hey!

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Thought I was playin', I had to show that lil bitch
I fucked her three times but I ain't know that lil bitch
Went platinum a couple times now it's gold on my wrist
Probation tryna drug test me, I canâ€™t hold my piss
They claim that I owe the money, I don't know that nigga
We throwin' up gang signs, no Zodiac nigga
Been locked up like three times, I can't go back nigga
Got these bitches watching me like a Kodak picture but
What am I to do when it feel like the walls are closing in, on me?
Time is ticking, got the Frank on my wrist, I ain't talking about Ski
I know these niggas talk about me
Be the same nigga who be walking 'round me
I tell a broke nigga "talk is cheap"
Thugga Thugga wit' me, can't forget about

[Hook: Young Thug]
Nipsey, smoke that lil bitch
Take the cuban link off and choke that lil bitch
I'mma gon' expose that lil bitch
If you didn't know it nigga, now you know that lil bitch, hey!
You's a cocka roach ass lil bitch
I'mma take your head off and roll it, no rollin' bitch, hey!
