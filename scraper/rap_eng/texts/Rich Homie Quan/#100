100 Ima keep it
Ion know no other way
Boy I know some secrets Ima take 'em to my grave
Made a promise to the people who believed that I would make it
Wasn't mad cuz of my team they were the reason I was grateful
And I'm sorry if it seemed like I was tryna rush ya
But thats the middle finga I was only tryna fuck ya
Ima go like a green light so shawty know im coming
And I gotta get my green right ye its all about that money
Its all about that money

[Verse 1]
And me and ho would go together
Give me something
I need crispy hundreds
Thats what i told the teller
And i know im better opposite of easy
Ima go forever ima keep my bankroll in the freezer
Frozen cheddar
That ho would tell ya im so rebelious
When i get rich ima grow me a million
Never go broke cuz i know the feeling
My souljas killing and i know they hear me
Get it back i know they did
Your khaki pants polo pimpin
I got your ho with me and she photogenic
Now we blowing sticky while we rolling in a benz
And they like quan lieing to people
1 plus 99 equal

[Verse 2]
Im talking bread in a butter pan
Price tag on your head need a rubberband
Dont fuck with feds that's a daily badge
Gotta make a plan i ain't trying take a chance
Show em how to live when i made a band
I was in and out the crib like a maintence man
I own the same building i was staitioned at
The music i run through i swear im making bands
And i made it fast lost it then i made it back
And the price dropped this week so i saved a rack
And im just stating facts like quan lieing to people
1 plus 99 equal
