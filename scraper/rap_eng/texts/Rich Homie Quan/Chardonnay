[Hook]
I ain't Braxton but I give her Toni
She got a deep voice like Sade
Wrist on dumb so retarded
Might skeet at your old lady
For me she go loco brazy
Eat that pussy like she put it on the table
Watch her ass like the man on cable
Got a hoe at each point RIP central station
I say her body taste like a tall glass of chardonnay
Her body taste like a tall glass of chardonnay
Her body shaped like a hourglass of ace of spades
Her body shaped like a hourglass of ace of spades

[Verse 1]
I don't do mascato, I need me ace of spades
Bring a hundred bottles fuck a receipt I don't care what it say
Don't care what it pay (yeah yeah)
If I want it i'ma come and get I don't care where she stay, I gotta maintain
I fuck with shawty cause she know her part
Fuck her In the back of the tour bus call her my Rosa Parks
Money stuffed in that shoe box starting to come off partly
I'ma go off in tool box if y'all niggas want war
I gotta Glock 40 in two pockets walking around with no shirt
Eyes on me heard that you watching fuck around and get murked
Eyes on me just like 2Pac like faster death no hearse
The reincarnated new 2Pac god blessed me with a curse, Amen

[Hook]
I ain't Braxton but I give her Toni

Got a hoe at each point RIP central station
I say her body taste like a tall glass of chardonnay
Her body taste like a tall glass of chardonnay
Her body shaped like a hourglass of ace of spades
Her body shaped like a hourglass of ace of spades

[Verse 2]
I'm in my own lane like Carlito (Yeah Yeah)
Just bought a brand new yacht came with torpedos (Yeah Yeah)
You know I put my lil brother on you can call me nino
And I ain't risking my life for a bitch might as well ride around with the kilo
Some of y'all done lost y'all mind kilo
Hit her from the spine on the d-low
I keep it one hundred like a beano
You need to practice on your shot like a free throw
I say now I (I I) couldn't stop going hard on these niggas if I tried (If I tried)
Chardonnay shawty shaped like wine
Pardon me I didn't mean no harm
I say I'm sorry bae to who it may concern
You not my bae it has not been confirmed
She keep it straight forward like a perm
