[Hook]
I'm trynna understand what the problem is (what the problem is?)
Why the fuck this hoe keep sayin' what a molly is
(what the fuck you mean)
'Cuz we be rolling, blowing, smoking Keisha
Fueled up off that diesel, my house look like an arena
Yea
(x2)

[Verse 1]
I saved 60 bands in like half a year
I almost lost my hand in the battle fields
I showed them folks my ass when I didn't care to give
Montay that's my man he had my back for years
I just caught a charge, no [?]
Hide my work up off in my socks til' the package clear
Fuck them sniffing dogs [?]
And I just wanna know why they after his
This hoe here must be crazy for some
Thinking she gone get in free, she got to pay me for some
(Ayee yeaaa)
And I'm just being modest, I'm just being honest
If it's a problem, then we'll solve it
