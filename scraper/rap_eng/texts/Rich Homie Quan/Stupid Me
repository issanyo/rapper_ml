[Intro]
Fool me once
Shame on you
Fool me twice
Shame on me
Better yet
Stupid me

[Chorus]
I just bought a brand new rollie cause they watching
Told her shawty spit on it baby get sloppy
So much money on me I don't need no wallet
Talking shit lil boy I'll pull up on ya
Good head you can tell shawty went to college
I just got another check imma go deposit
Stupid me
I got caught running round the lobby
New Ferrari, 458, it's a spider

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna fight her cause I don't want no new charges
Call me Michael Tyson that clitoris I bite on it
Made that lil ho piss on herself she got too excited
Baby don't tell me to come if you know I ain't invited
Middle finger to the DA
Cuz her attitude indictment
Yeah I'm from that GA nigga what you gone do bout it
Don't care what he say
All my niggas bout it
It ain't take for me to buy a safe to save a thousand

[Bridge]
(Ayeeeee)
What you talking bout Quan?(ayeeeee)
I got the ho screaming like(aye ayeee)
She say she fell in love with me(aye ayeee)
Hey!
Get a nigga knocked out for nothing(ayeeeee)
If he don't like me well fuck him(aye ayeee)
I'll put yo ass in that oven(aye ayeee)
Set you on fire bitch that's nothing

[Verse 2]
You ain't never heard of rich till you heard of Rich Homie baby(ayeeeee)
Upside down but I just might go buy a new Mercedes
Pink slip bitch I bought the lady
She tried to trap the Homie with a baby
I ain't going for that
I don't want you back(nah foreal)
Pull up at that nigga spot just like a cheetah
Give that ho three stripes just like a pair of Adidas
Had to cut that ho off because she thought I needed her(aye)
Just like a lemon bae you know know that imma squeeze it
Might lay you down, put you to sleep, tempurpedic
That lil ho swear that she on fleek but she easy
RIP Nut
Shoutout to my nigga Greedy
I rolled up my sleeves and showed them niggas

[Chorus]
I just bought a brand new rollie cause they watching
Told her shawty spit on it baby get sloppy
So much money on me I don't need no wallet
Talking shit lil boy I'll pull up on ya
Good head you can tell shawty went to college
I just got another check imma go deposit
Stupid me
I got caught running round the lobby
New Ferrari, 458, it's a spider
