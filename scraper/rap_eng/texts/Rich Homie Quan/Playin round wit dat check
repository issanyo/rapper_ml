Smoking like a chimney
All i know is fire
Whip it like a chemist
I'm higher than Mariah
Rest in peace to micheal
Jackson i'm in the And they let me out for a minute
I'm going back in like I left something
One of the best of em and I swear I ain't like the rest of em
And I check some If you flexin
V12 my lexus
They suggest us to go broke
Cause we finesse them with that dope
And they respect the game cause they know
Thats just the way that it go
Like a dealer in Vegas I pull cards
East Atlanta made a hood starve, Rich Homies who I do it for
I was in Bedford pine on boulevard
Getting off that work and ima spend it till it's gone
Put a door on the beat I go in on every song
I go I I go I go in on every song, go in on every song, go in on every so-ong
I go I I go I go in on every song I I I I go in on every so-ong
Teasey here so we back at it
I'm short stackin, back handin
First class that pack landin
Hitting home runs in battin practice
That wood back got cork in it
Baking soda got a fork with it
She seen how long my check was and she tried to make me her boyfriend
Stay out all night but ima go in
No choice with, i'm endorsed with
Gucci, louis my sports gear I stay up like a fork lift
For da nigga hatin I got stupid surveillance
I put cameras in the porsche rear
Shit go more real with only one bullet I was forced to kill
The beat, the instrumental, whatever you call it
I said it to my realm, I gotta give him credit for it
D.I. I see you bruh, I go in on every song
A feature, what I need it for
I go I I go I go in on every song, go in on every song, go in on every so-ong
I go I I go I go in on every song I I I I go in on every so-ong
Go in on every song
Spit flame in every line
Tell my story cross my t's and dot my i's
Shit a'int sweet, we got killers that sleep in every spot
Shit get deep wit no shovel niggas die every night
Rest in peace to d-rock, free my nigga chicken
You gotta dance for me and the niggas with me
I got a smothered onion Off that Cajun chicken
And if your pockets broke let this paper fix it
You can take a picture only with the flash off
No lights on when my ice on
That'll make me pass out
You assed out like an exposed whore
I go in like a closed door every song
I go I I go I go in on every song, go in on every song, go in on every so-ong
I go I I go I go in on every song I I I I go in on every so-ong
