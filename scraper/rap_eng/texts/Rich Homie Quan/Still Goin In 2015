[Intro]
I'm pretty sure you see these chains on right now and I be damned if I take em off
I walk around the house with all mine on

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Been through a whole lot of shit I be damn if I go back broke naw no way no way
I moved out the hood bought a house in the suburbs told my niggas I don't owe them niggas nothing
Now them niggas mad that I made it
Every time I come around they start acting shady
But I don't give two fucks about it nigga, cuz they wasn't there when I was broke
They wasn't there when I needed help hey
Where the fuck they was at when my mama needed help, they was no where to be found
Me, Chicken, and Mario had to hold it down
Beat a nigga ass give a fuck bout lock down
Take a nigga weed and he bet not make a sound
But if he do next thing you know we gon hang his ass out
Shout out to the COs who let a nigga ride on the foreign when he was in visitation (naw)
Shout out to the COs who let a nigga whack all that eat it up all in they faces
When they know they liked that but couldn't wanna tell nobody
Jumped out that top roll like Scotty too hotty, Made it to the top now the fuck nigga watching
Cause I made it all by myself, I ain't need no help nigga
Naw nigga imma ball nigga just like Spalding
You do a lot of talking, I don't like to talk cause I rather let the chopper talk for me (whoo)
New bitch new car I'm swerving, make her ride it like Kentucky Durby
Promise I won't cheat just do not hurt me
Hurt me no hurt me

[Bridge]
I don't wanna lie no more, I don't wanna cheat no more
I wanna make my wrongs right and I just wanna even the score, score whoo whoo whoo!

[Hook]
Been through a whole lot of shit I be damn if I go back broke naw no way no way
I moved out the hood bought a house in the suburbs told my niggas I don't
Owe them niggas nothing
Now them niggas mad that I made it
Every time I come around they start acting shady
But I don't give two fucks about it nigga (I don't give two fucks about it nigga)

[Verse 2:Rich Homie Quan]
Aye listen
Okay with that being said I aim it at his chest
He got his hands up like he saying the pledge
Pledge of allegiance, National Anthem
I got him screaming, he need a pamper, he shitted hiself he shitted hiself oh lord
He see I'm the best so I beat him to death oh god forgive me
Cause they ain't take a nigga like me serious
What was I to do when nobody was there to hear me
I did some fucked up shit it's me who gotta live with it
I remember my first job I got fired, I remember my first time watching the wire
I remember playing hide and go seek but wasn't hiding, I wasn't even tryna find you
I was rumbling tryna find me some Pradas, I did I did I did did
I did it I did it, Even though I ain't go to college still made me a whole lot of money
Laughing at my teachers who said I would never be shit
Tell me why they hated on me for no reason, I remember when we was beefing with 4 season
And I ain't talking bout fall no spring, even when the times when a nigga on free
And the summer time short so imma freak some for these hoes
Naw no polish on them nigga, I don't do that gay shit no I don't do that gay shit
Young sissy lovers
I don't fuck with them fuck y'all mothafuckas it's 9 duece no other
Tell me what it is that I could learn from you
Fuck you you stupid muhfucka you suffer
