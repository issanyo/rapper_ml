[Intro: Rich Homie Quan]
Que
Rich Homie baby
It's the way that you walk, hey

[Chorus: Que]
Shawty independent, I like how she handle business
She gon' go and get it, yeah she ain't with it
I bought a roll of tissue for the way she shittin' on bitches
She a real boss bitch and that pussy hittin', yeah
Is it the way she talk or is it the way she walk
When she lookin' back
She her own sugar daddy
Can't do nothin' but respect it, yeah

[Verse 1: Que]
Shawty she independent, self-dependent, she 'bout her business
She ain't fuckin' around with no nigga who don't know how to get up and go get it
She already got her own yeah, so certain shit don't faze her
She ain't askin' for no favors and she ain't hurt for no paper
She havin' plenty, Chanel, Fendi
She in it, she got it, she did it
That's light work, know pressure make pipes burst
And if you ain't got it she on to the next, gone to that check
She ain't like to rest on, you ain't right, you gettin' left, period
She ain't never been no groupie bitch
She look like her shit tight, I bet it grip

[Chorus: Que]
Shawty independent, I like how she handle business
She gon' go and get it, yeah she ain't with it
I bought a roll of tissue for the way she shittin' on bitches
She a real boss bitch and that pussy hittin', yeah
Is it the way she talk or is it the way she walk
When she lookin' back
She her own sugar daddy
Can't do nothin' but respect it, yeah

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
I respect the fact that shawty get her own money
I respect the fact that she don't ask for no loan from me
Big B, shawty do whatever for me, she my roadrunner
Tryna get that Diddy Combs money, and I don't trust no woman but you (fuck them hoes)
Kept it so loyal 'cause I only fuck you (yeah you my heart)
Flyin', tryna get to you, doin' a buck two (skrrt)
We can go at your tempo, ain't tryna rush you (nah)
You independent, that's the reason I cuffed you (and that's on my mama)
That the main thing that turned me (I swear)
I'm gettin' head in her Maybach with the curtains closed
Her friends don't take me serious like a circus show (fuck them bitches)
For shawty I had to cut off them thirsty hoes

[Chorus: Que]
Shawty independent, I like how she handle business
She gon' go and get it, yeah she ain't with it
I bought a roll of tissue for the way she shittin' on bitches
She a real boss bitch and that pussy hittin', yeah
Is it the way she talk or is it the way she walk
When she lookin' back
She her own sugar daddy
Can't do nothin' but respect it, yeah

[Outro: Rich Homie Quan]
She her own sugar daddy
She her own sugar daddy (Que)
She her own sugar daddy (Rich Homie baby)
She her own sugar daddy
