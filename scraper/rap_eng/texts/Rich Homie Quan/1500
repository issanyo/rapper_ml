Spend more than 1500 on the clothes
1500 fo’ the short, 1500 fo’ the belt, nigga
1500 fo’ the shirt, 1500 fo’ the app, nigga
1500 fo’ the pants, 1500 fo’ the beat
1500 ain’t shit, 1500 got me rich
15 times 15 for a walk through
1500 turned to 15.000
1500 turned to a 15.000
1500 turned to a 30.000
1500 turned to a 50.000
1500 turned to a 1.000.000 dollas

(Verse: Rich Homie Quan)
Hey, money, I get it, I stack it, I flip it
Aye, talkin’ bout savin’, yeah, I get ‘em digits
Aye, I’m gon’ eat that pussy like Thanksgiving, no pilgrim
Way, fuck ‘er all in her stomach, I bet that she feel it
Hey, Inga with family, my nigga wrestle my nigga billies
Some of my niggas go get it
All of my niggas they kill it
All o’ my niggas got teardrop
All of my niggas got bodies
Dressed in all black like I’m Batman
All of my niggas be rivin’
Kiss and get help, poison ivy
Jokin’ with her like a joker
I cannot play with her feelings
I don’t get receipt, but I know that I spend
More than 1500 on clothes

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan)
1500 hoes at my house right nah
1500 niggas hate, tell a nigga pipe down
Aye, I been a fan o’ Wayne eva since these dropped Lights Out
Ha, one bad drae, yeah, nigga I’m fresh, I ain’t talkin’ lights out
Aye, ride like a bike, baby

Ya thinkin’ that I might be amazed?
Then go ahead, tell ‘em

(Verse 3: Peewee)

Finesse and juggin’ 1500 on diamonds
Finesse and juggin’ 1500 keep comin’
Finesse and juggin’ 1500 on bunkin'
Finesse and juggin’ 1500 got junkies
Finesse and juggin’ 15 keys out the country

Dad ain’t owe nobody no money
Turn 15 dollas into 1500
Mr. Blue M&M Offset Rich Homie

Two fingers and a thumb, banging blue
Longway, bitch!

(Hook)

(Verse 4)
Doin’ 1500 on em’ ecstasy

If 1500 people want kill me
Then 1500 don’t scare me
Mane this shit why my Christmas so merry

My last Christmas was a sad Christmas
Ova 1500 people shitted on me

Lemme tell ya what I did with that money
Got a lil pack, got a lil crack
Fo’ 1500 and I kept on runnin’
I know I done fucked 1500 hoes

#1500 was my Beemer note
Aye aye, nigga fuck what you say

He crossed the line? He bout to die, fo’ 1500
These Robin jeans, this Louie belt?
This Louie scarf is so fly
My earrings, they bling bling

Rolls Royce with the stars in the ceiling
Make 1500 fo’ like 15 million
Gave 1500 to my bitch
Baby, go shoppin, Boosie ain’t trippin’
Boosie ain’t trippin’ cuz I’m gettin’ it (rule 1)

Shout out to my nigga Young Jeezy
He keep it 1500 with a nigga
