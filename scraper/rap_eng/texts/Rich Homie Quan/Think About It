[Verse 1]
I got this fine hoe who don't work but be complaining all the time
She wanna leave me, that for certain, say she called a nigga line
I'm tired of cheating, tired of flirting, girl, I hate to see you cry
Loved you then, can't hate you now, girl, you irreplaceable
I got them working, I got the construction, I got them nigga who get it like Russians
Just bought some choppers, I'm ready to bust em
Boy you like 12 cause you cop em and cuff em
I got some bells in the closet I stuffed em
Bagging niggas in the closet we bust em
Stacking pennys on you niggas who [?]
I got plenty niggas stacked to the ceiling

[Hook]
Think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it
Think about it right now Quan
I say now think about it right now Quan
THINK about it
THINK about it
THINK about it
About it, think about it

[Verse 2]
Think about it when I got my hands on my first cheque
Think about it when a young nigga hit his first lick
Think about it, broke nigga yeah, I'm allergic to that
Think about it, I was stunting on right on when I was surfing that
Think about it, hold up
Bring around me, I'mma show off
How to ride dick, no chaffeur
All this money on me, I'm 'bout to throw up
Shawty keep her feet out in the summertime, when I call her, she up
Push the water then I flood, I'mma keep gaining, money, ain't enough
Who the fuck told you that that lil nigga, yeah I got it fucked up
Hanging out the passenger side of your best friend car, you a screw up, TLC, you too lame, cuh
Slapped it, I'm a Blood, passed that like a blunt
That fat ass, I love, UGH, ugh
You be acting tough when you know your ass in love
We only did it one time in the store, I can't help that I just keep

[Hook]
Think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it
Think about it right now Quan
I say now think about it right now Quan
THINK about it
THINK about it
THINK about it
About it, think about it
