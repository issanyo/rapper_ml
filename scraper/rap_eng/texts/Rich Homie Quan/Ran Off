Ran off that money, yeah yeah
Ran off with them diamonds, yeah yeah
Fuckin‘ hoes on a Monday, yeah yeah

I’m gon’ keep getting money on this niggas just like yeah yeah
I’m gon’ keep fucking these nigga bitches just like yeah yea
Gotta know the opposite of no always gon’ be yeah yeah
And I’m gon’ never stop getting to the money boy, you know I swear swear

[Verse 1]
I just bought me a brand new rollie, Icebox, I swear
I ain’t even walked in the club yet, and I already sold it out the bar
I used to smoke nothing but swisher, now I roll my weed raw
Ass so fat I ain't have no condom boy had to hit that raw
But you gotta know a nigga like me pull it out and I went straight for the mouth
I just want her little potato
If I leave that pussy red like a little tomato
Hide right under the bed, cause her daddy crazy
I rep the 5 like a motherfuckin’ nickle baby
Ay look, extra money is just grip statement
I promise I gotta die anyway
I done made a whole lotta money
I done seen a whole lotta people
I had to stack a onion
My foreign cars are real
Pull up in that 458 spider
That every nigga gon’ hate
Because you know he wanna be us (For real)
I want to touch
She wouldn't let me
I want to fuck
She just be neglecting
I want to love her
I want to wife her
I want to walk down the isle
Your daddy gave me permission
Your momma didn’t wanna listen
Your brother can't stand my guts
Your sister she love my pimpin'
She don’t  know that her friends so freaky
She don’t know that they really love her
She might as well fuck with me, instead of a chicken nugget
I got chicken tender for you
Ay, where that ranch at, babe?
We could fuck up the mall
Girl and ball like a cancer patient
Hate when a nigga be lying, boy you talking and that aggravate me
Her best friend play baseball in the outfit [?]
They treat me [?]
[?] put me on and told me a lot of these jewels are fake
I know that your rollie fake
Look at your wrist that shit outdated
Once watchbusters catch it
You can’t hide it, ain’t no secret
Might as well give that shit away
Ain’t no point even tryin' to keep it
I love my nigga bleeding
That dog food I feed it
To my soldier, to my young nigga
I told you get to clapping shit, hallelujah
I ain’t dappin' for you If I don’t know you
I got 10 bands saran wrapped in a Toyota
