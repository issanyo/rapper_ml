(Verse)
Hey if I'm flying down 20
Then it's purple what I use
4 till I drive it then I throw that bitch a coupe
Throw stupid car alarm I know every spot to do it
Ain't no talking in my car
Bitch that's what that new is
For that kush smell , you would stop
Thank the cop, handicapped
Now a nigga my roofie gone
Sister got me picky 'cause I'm 4 how I used to roll
Chevy black and white like the I love Lucy
Throw me up out the way
I think I brought the 40 way
Get uncle said Jay 'cause it take all my money
Partner frontin, grinding in that phantom on black
In that 5 50 K with the camera in the back of the benz baby

(Hook)

She wanna fuck me 'cause she love the way my car smells
Night over night but I earn my stripe feel like Garfield
She wanna fuck me 'cause she love the way my car smells
