[Hook: IamCompton and Rich Homie Quan]
I'mma turn it up now
I'mma... turn it... up
I'mma fuck it up now
I'mma... fuck it... up
I'mma turn it up
I'mma... turn it... up
I'mma fuck it up
I'mma... fuck it... up

[Verse: IamCompton]
I'mma hit 'em up, middle fingers up now
Used to be down, but I'm up
Aussie turned off, put 'em on now
It's like I got up in the zone like a kush stone
Feels good, real good to me
Wouldn't trade it in fo' nothin', if I could homie
Don't get this shit misunderstood, homie
I wish a muthafucka would, owe me
Walk up in that bitch like what it's hittin' fo'?
Bottle lady showed me to my table
Dj bout to put my record on
The whole club goin' wavy
I'm so high, that you can barely see my eyes
And I'm so fly, think I lost my track of time
But IamCompton, Compton I am I
All the real ass girls know that I'm that guy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
I'mma turn it up like the nob your the radio
I swear with hoes I do not know which way to go
I don't care bout get caught, I'm a boss and I stay playin' hoes
Pay that bitch some attention, that's the only way that I pay a ho
That pussy good, swear to god I'mma fuck it up
If I find out she cheatin' on me, I'mma fuck 'er up
And that's on everythang, cuz too much invested in her
I told shawty I'm more faded than a muthafuckin' plug
Don't know what it is about her, they got me so fucked
She got me doin' shit that I neva said I would do
She be makin' sad lil face, if she get a ticket, I'mma fuckin' validate it
I got hoes everywhere, shout out my Cali bitches
Neva been to Compton, but shout out to my nigga Compton
