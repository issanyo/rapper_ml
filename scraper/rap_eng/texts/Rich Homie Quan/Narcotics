[Intro]
Hey (dat right, too!)
Rich Homie baby
What do my nigga I'm good
Hey Quan, I'm straight, I'm straight
What do, my nigga we good
Let's go
Ok, Ok

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
15 on me long way I got it (I do, I do)
Walkin wit it on me, see it pokin out my pocket
I was rolling in that Audi, how them folks know I got it (I don't know)
I'm the socket and the plug, they watchin' for the drugs
Yeah, we call it narcotics, narcotics, narcotics
Call it narcotics narcotics narcotics
I don't fold, no I got it, no I got it, no I got it
They plottin' and they watchin'
We out here, we mobbin'
And we sellin' narcotics

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Got stack on me, Lil' Ant rest in peace
That's my nigga and a T shirt, shootin' dice behind the bleacher
Blowin' loud like speakers
Young nigga doin' whatever to get that pack gone
Ever since my nigga died, never be the same on Flat Shoals
I find myself reminiscing (bout what?)
Remember graduation
Me you and me and Crucial we smoking, we kickin' it
Go get my bitches in, toasting the riches cuz
We rich forever, its whatever, I feel my spirit lifting up
Won't hear me givin' up, penthouse ain't big enough
I got my top drop set right semi tucked
I don't give a fuck
Run from twelve and I see the cut
Got 8 thousand plus 7 thousand and that equal what?

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
15 on me long way I got it (I do, I do)
Walkin wit it on me, see it pokin out my pocket
I was rolling in that Audi, how them folks know I got it (I don't know)
I'm the socket and the plug, they watchin' for the drugs
Yeah, we call it narcotics, narcotics, narcotics
Call it narcotics narcotics narcotics
I don't fold, no I got it, no I got it, no I got it
They plottin' and they watchin'
We out here, we mobbin'
And we sellin' narcotics

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
True thug can't fold, new money, same ho
I was bored, nothing to do, fucked with a swoop, but I didn't know
Now I'm coolin' like a roll
She goin' do whatever I ask her
I heard she like acting, made this movie on my camera
I do shit for no better
Yeah, narcotics don't need her to prove it (what the hell you mean?)
I love her so much cause she studied pharmaceutics
I'm drug abusing
That weed baby (that kush)
It's your love I'm choosin'
No doubt she need me more

Narcotic, hard body
I'm bout it, better know it
Go about it, talking business, hundred thousands, I'ma throw it
No glasses on , I see what's up (RayBan homie)
Your bitch had hold me 10 bags plus 5 more that equal what

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
15 on me long way I got it (I do, I do)
Walkin wit it on me, see it pokin out my pocket
I was rolling in that Audi, how them folks know I got it (I don't know)

Yeah, we call it narcotics, narcotics, narcotics
Call it narcotics narcotics narcotics
I don't fold, no I got it, no I got it, no I got it
