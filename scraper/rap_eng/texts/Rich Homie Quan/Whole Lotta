[Hook]
Before I went to sleep I was broke
Had a dream about money
Yesterday is gone
So today I gotta make something
Ima buy my mama a new home and nall
Nigga I ain't frontin, because I use to have nothing
But now I gotta whole lot, whole lot, whole lot, whole lot, hey
Whole lot, whole lot, whole lot, whole lot, hey
Whole lot,  whole lot, whole lot, whole lot, hey
Whole lot, whole lot, whole lot, whole lot (had that money baby)

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Got a lot of money, even more problems
I know a lot of killers, know even more robbers
Boy put down that pistol, I even know shooters
Pull up with my niggas, I need like four bottles
Deez nigga bored soap opera
His ho thick and gorgeous plus her throat swallow
Bank roll enormous, but I need more dollars
Find a bitch to go with see that’s no problem
He unloyal cause he yo patna
Can’t get no lawyer he need more gwala
These bitch acting like they loyal, give that ho a Oscar
Money, I got a whole lot
And I hope them bed bugs don’t bite because

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Whole lot of homies, all of em rich
My bitches like my bank roll all of them thick
My homie flexin with a bank roll
All of us in I take that back we more like brothers, all of us ken
My necklace cost a benz, flexin by accident
Wrap up with tacklin, catch up keep practicin, bad bitches after me
Gotta whole lot of them faces
And I woke up with a bank roll so something must be crazy cause
