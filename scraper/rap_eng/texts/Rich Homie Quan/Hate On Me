[Hook]
If you see that 40 on me, boy you know I ain't gon play
I ain't blowin' none of my money, so you know a nigga straight
Most these niggas, yeah they phony, so I keep em' out my face
I done ran up my money, so I know that they gon' hate
They gon hate, gon hate, gon hate (7x)

[Verse 1]
I know that, yeah, so I got that nigga bitch like "ooh, ahhh"
Pulled up in that mothafuckin', whoo, ooh
Shoutout to my nigga Thugga, I need like 2 (Slime, what it do?)
Money by the commas
Shoutout to my momma
We gettin' money in my pajamas
Had to stay down for the come-up
If I run that ball, I won't fumble
I done done it, I done made stumbles
See none of y'all, Stevie Wonder
Still look up to my uncle
To stand by me, boy, it's an honor
I'm still tryna fuck, Madonna
But I ain't gotta fuck with none of
These stuck up bitches, loco bitches
Catch a nigga slippin' with no condom
Now that ratchet hoe yo baby mama
I'm just gon tell her

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
What did I do to these niggas to make 'em mad at me?
Might as well, get these niggas, to call they granddaddy
I won't tell, I don't know, what them folks sayin' somethin'
So please don't ask nothin'
Cause I don't know (6x)
I will never change, homie
Put that on my name, homie (Rich Homie Baby!)
My name is all I got, that's what I stand for
Fit a hundred thou in these pants, boy
Can't remember shit, with them Xans on
Got a foreign bitch, big ole' ass on
Country nigga sweet, I ran up
And I passed out, I ain't have no seat cause TMZ was braggin'
If you see my pants saggin', you ain't gotta ask no questions, just know

[Hook]
