[Intro]
I been knew, life was a gamble man, You know I'm sayin'
We all take a risk everyday, (laugh), but I ain't trippin, I just gotta do this

[Hook]
Roll the dice, hit the curb, do yo number, pick up money
Jumped off mama porch and hit the ground running
Trap spot do that percs, sell that molly, smoke that reefer
Momma told me she ain't like me hanging with them people
Made a 40 put in 20 made it flip again
20 bands from the bank 200 benjamin's
200 bands for some bags boy you better call me
U-Haul van in the mall, me and what ya call it

[Verse 1]
Money on the phone, money callin' yeah I talk to it
Need a new safe 'cause the money got a wall full
I just spent a day in the bay it was all good
Back end count it up by myself before I walk thru it
All about my business and my pockets nun' but white folks
Money can't buy love 'cause this bitch ain't even my type doe
Turn up at the day party and kill 'em at the night show
Real nigga reunion I fuck wit 'em so iImight go
Rapping easy I can do it "arm tied , eyes closed"
When robbing was a job I would do that shit from "9 to 4"
My partner drove from holly grove to here to get them xan's
And I rebulk every number with that money in my had

[Hook]
The other day, hit da curb, do yo number, pick up money
Jumped off mama porch and hit the ground running
Trap spot do that percs, sell that moll , smoke that reefer
Momma told me she ain't like me hanging with them people
Made a 40 put in 20 made it flip again
20 bands from the bank 200 benjamin's
200 bands for some bags boy you better call me
Uhaul van in the mall, me and what ya call it

[Verse 2]
I just went to court and the judge let me walk for it
God put my blessing in the hood I had to walk for it
I can end a conversation quick like a off button
Money come up every other hour yeah I talk numbers
Lil homie in the cut finger itching ready to off some
If you ain't talk money over 100's it ain't bout nun'
Partner did 10 and he already wanna rob some
Count that backend by myself and naw we ain't lost nun'
For me they clear the room make some space for the boss come
Canary yellow diamond got these niggas acting cautious
He scary and he lying I can tell by how he talkin'
VVS's they shining I got my number and I'm bout da

[Hook]
The other day, hit da curb, do yo number, pick up money
Jumped off mama porch and hit the ground running

Momma told me she ain't like me hanging with them people
Made a 40 put in 20 made it flip again
20 bands from the bank 200 benjamin's
