Stayed down in the nitty gritty then came up with
My Homie
I got a lot of money and a lot of fame but never changed up on
My Homie
She wanna fuck Quan, she wanna fuck Thug, she might as well be one of the homies
I don't trust girls, I don't love girls, I only love my homie
Gotta buch of love for my homie
She gotta show love to my homie
Tryna get down? my homie
Fuck round get killed by my homie
Play enough game by my my homie
I know they heard about my my homie
Thugger, Thugger my homie
And I'm down for my homie

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Run it up with my homie, ambulance your homie
Nigga play with my homie
I'mma let this chopper dance for my homie
Hundred zans, I'm a stoner
Hundred bands and it's on me
Every time a nigga do it
I swear I need a cameraman for these moments
I'mma Matt like Bonner
I pull up if you want it
Cash out like Charlie Sheen when it come to Thugger, Rich Homie
Chopper bullet F&N me
If the bitch ain't got no class you know that's truancy
I don't want the panties off unless it's done by me
Rick Ross voice you know it costs to be a boss like me
So many crystals in my neck they think I'm from Tennessee
Gangsters they pretend to be
Thugger smokin' sour weed, I'm like lemon please

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Glock 40 my homie
Bankroll my homie
Shittin' on all my old hoes who ain't want me
I made a lot of money but never switched up on my homies
But I done switched girls with my homies
Ask Nard, he knows it
I done make a whole lotta money with my homies
I done see a whole lotta homies turn phony
I don't trust you but I trust my homies
I'mma keep it real with no cut on it
That Porsche truck my homie
That lean plug my homie
Never go to sleep while on it
Shouts out to my homie
My homie told me we'll be rich forever
From the bottom with my homies, we gone get this shit together
If I fall down I'mma get back up
With who? With my homie
If I lose a little bit, get it rich back up
