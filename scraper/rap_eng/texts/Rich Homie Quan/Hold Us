[Intro: PeeWee Longway]
Dun Deal on the motherfuckin' track
Thugger, Quan
Ya'll know what's happenin'

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
If we get locked up by the night
I know those folk gone try and hold us
Got grams for niggas on white
And we keep seals for niggas who poured up
Trappin' all night in skinny jeans, got a bankroll that won't fold up
Shootin' at niggas like they cameraman and that what we call exposure
And we get locked up by tonight I know those folk gone try and hold us
Got grams for niggas all white, and we keep seals for niggas who poured up
Living life never sober
My ring looking like a solar
And if we get locked up by the night, I know those folks gone try and hold us

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan + Young Thug]
Try and (?), and I can't say hold up
Big (bs) lifestyle, Thugger need two bucks
I can't treat a bitch like a queen, I don't even know her
She slime ain't nothin' I'mma show her
Pull up in the Bentley, no chauffeur
Backwood, MPA smoke campus
White bitch drive a black beamer, have you seen it?
White bitch kiss white bitch, did they mean that?
I know those hoes ain't mean that
This year, a whole lotta cash made shit a whole lotta cash man
I need a first aid kit along with band aid
You know why?
Thug bleed like a motherfuckin' vampire
More carrots then a motherfuckin' damn pie
OG is what i smoke by
Fingernails got fungi, fungi
I'm a real nigga, you a fun guy
Runnin bands up without Illuminati
You better off coachin' in syri

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
If we get locked up by the night
I know those folk gone try and hold us
Got grams for niggas on white
And we keep seals for niggas who poured up
Trappin' all night in skinny jeans, got a bankroll that won't fold up
Shootin' at niggas like they cameraman and that what we call exposure
And we get locked up by tonight I know those folk gone try and hold us
Got grams for niggas all white, and we keep seals for niggas who poured up
Living life never sober
My ring looking like a solar
And if we get locked up by the night, I know those folks gone try and hold us

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan + Young Thug]
I don't talk to 12, I don't like conversation
Heard my nigga Pee got them bails all across the nation
Smell it before you taste it
Last time I went to jail, I beat all my cases
Mail, that's a risk you takin'
Ever since I found my cell, she been wearing on my patience 
You can throw that bitch in water, but you still can't save her
Bitches  fuckin if you famous (Rich Homie, baby)
And you know I can't forget about
PeeWee, Thugger, Rich Homie, kill these niggas
I'm with PeeWee and double trouble, tool box, drill these bitches
Who got 20 tissues? I'm shittin' on ya'll
And we workin', even though 12 is lurking

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
If we get locked up by the night
I know those folk gone try and hold us
Got grams for niggas on white
And we keep seals for niggas who poured up
Trappin' all night in skinny jeans, got a bankroll that won't fold up
Shootin' at niggas like they cameraman and that what we call exposure
And we get locked up by tonight I know those folk gone try and hold us
Got grams for niggas all white, and we keep seals for niggas who poured up
Living life never sober
My ring looking like a solar
And if we get locked up by the night, I know those folks gone try and hold us


[Verse 3: PeeWee Longway]
Out there we juggin', play those houses turn them bitches to the trenches
Trappin', ninja Givenchies, bankrolls on me ain't (bending)
In them velcros just sippin'
How the hell I'm trippin'?
No prescription for this medicine, how the hell I'm sippin'?
One button I'm pushin', Audi A7 or 80
Deviled up and I'm Kid Cudi ghost ridin' with you lady
Sucking on my dick like 8 Mile, She choke her like Slim Shady
40 pointers on my pinky ring, fuck 12 cause they know they hatin'
Longway

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
If we get locked up by the night
I know those folk gone try and hold us
Got grams for niggas on white
And we keep seals for niggas who poured up
Trappin' all night in skinny jeans, got a bankroll that won't fold up
Shootin' at niggas like they cameraman and that what we call exposure
And we get locked up by tonight I know those folk gone try and hold us
Got grams for niggas all white, and we keep seals for niggas who poured up
Living life never sober
My ring looking like a solar
And if we get locked up by the night, I know those folks gone try and hold us
