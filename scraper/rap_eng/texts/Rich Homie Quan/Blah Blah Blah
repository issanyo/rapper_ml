[Intro]
Yeah
(Rich Homie)
Quan
(What’s funny?)
These niggas throwing slick shots like
You know me?
I go direct with it
Ya feel me
Put her name on it, nigga

[Hook]
You know it was hard to hear at first
I couldn’t understand what you sayin’
And these bitches bound to get hurt
‘Cause a lot of these niggas be playin’
And I fuck with shorty on the low
And I know she know I’m the man
So that extra shit gotta go
She probably don’t know that I fucked her friend
If she ask about it
I’m a be like, “Blah blah blah blah”
When she try to argue with me
I be like, “Blah blah blah blah”
Trying to get back with me
I be like, “Hell nah nah nah”
And we ain’t talking about no money
I’m like, “Blah blah blah blah”

[Verse 1]
Small talk I don't do that
Get rich homie, you knew that
It’s a damn shame, I don’t gang bang
But I beat a nigga blue black
I’m in the old school, no do-rag
Them old folk like how you do that?
He ain’t fooling me, this ain’t new to me
That ain’t an Aston Martin, that’s a new Jag
But it clean, though
And if you’re late on the payment, boy, that shit get repo’d
And your bitch easy, ha
I got her on the line and I’m in her like a free throw
Getting deep throat, at the Fontainebleau
We running trains on these freak hoes
And I told my nigga that I decoded
“Blah blah blah blah”
Quit going in on these niggas
I won’t stop stop stop stop
Keep putting my money over these bitches
‘Til I’m at the top top top top
And you niggas can’t stop my vision
Don’t know what you thought thought thought thought
And I ball ball ball ball
Everything I got’s all good

[Hook]
You know it was hard to hear at first
I couldn’t understand what you sayin’
And these bitches bound to get hurt
‘Cause a lot of these niggas be playin’
And I fuck with shorty on the low
And I know she know I’m the man
So that extra shit gotta go
She probably don’t know that I fucked her friend (ok)
If she ask about it
I’m a be like, “Blah blah blah blah”
When she try to argue with me
I be like, “Blah blah blah blah”
Trying to get back with me
I be like, “Hell nah nah nah”
And we ain’t talking about no money
I’m like, “Blah blah blah blah”

[Verse 2]
“Blah blah blah blah”
That’s how it sound when these bitches talk
“Rah rah rah rah”
When a nigga flexin that's what we call it
Like “Hell nah nah nah”
And these real diamonds, I ain't fake connected
I’m like five nine feet tall
Heart of a lion, he ain’t takin’ that
You nigga talking like ho
That’s why I can’t fuck with you
Doing shows all around the globe
‘Cause everybody fuck with me
Fuck nigga
You’ll be in the front nigga
I’ll show you what’s up nigga
Fuck nigga
Ain’t never said that shit’s bad
Trying to keep it one hunna
And I tried to show love with you
That’s the main reason why I don’t trust niggas (trust)
Standin’ under landing bridges still above these niggas
I’m no beginner
Don’t I spit it like a vet, nigga?
That nigga talkin’ like a ho
Tell that bitch nigga speak up

[Hook]
You know it was hard to hear at first
I couldn’t understand what you sayin’
And these bitches bound to get hurt
‘Cause a lot of these niggas be playin’
And I fuck with shorty on the low
And I know she know I’m the man
So that extra shit gotta go
She probably don’t know that I fucked her friend (ok)
If she ask about it
I’m a be like, “Blah blah blah blah”
When she try to argue with me
I be like, “Blah blah blah blah”
Trying to get back with me
I be like, “Hell nah nah nah”
And we ain’t talking about no money
I’m like, “Blah blah blah blah”
Bitch I'm a baby
