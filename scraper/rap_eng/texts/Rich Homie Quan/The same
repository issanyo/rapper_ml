[Intro]
The same bitches that I went to school with
The same nigga I thought I was cool with
The same car that I used to dream about
That's that same car that you see me leaning out

[Bridge]
I started with a dollar and a dream
Turned that dollar to some millions
And that dream to a movie
And that same movie you watching I directed
And my camera man shoot it like he filming extras

[Verse 1]
I know big dogs
Real great dames
See they shoot first then take names
They don't play about it
Come at where you stay about it
You probably don't believe me though
But you can ask J about it
S-S-So don't say you got it
Because my niggas hungry
They'll stay up late about it
If they really want you
Let that AK decide it
And you'll become a donor
I bid the highest for that pussy that makes me the owner
Right?
And these same niggas still hating on me mamma
No disrespect but my pistol gotta stay on me mamma
It's some fuck niggas outchea i gotta play it safe
Broke bitch get out my face

[Hook 2]
They trying to fuck the same, the same bitches that I went to school with
(?), The same nigga I thought I was cool with
(You know what's up homie) The same car that I used to dream about
(You know what's up homie) That's that same car that you see me leaning out
They trying to fuck the same, the same bitches that I went to school with
(?), The same nigga I thought i was cool with
You know what's up homie (Nah I don't)
You know what's up homie

[Verse 2]
Whole lotta money
Got a whole lotta problems
But nigga that don't mean shit
Y'all niggas banging for colors I'd rather get that green shit
My nigga (...?...) probably one of the cleanest
I done ever layed my eyes upon
Ain't never told no lie for fun
I had to get payed for it
Such as flexing and finessing
We do it on the regular
I'm somewhere now working with a Mexican
Trying to find another plug
Got your girl going the school stripping
Bout to put her in another club
Vip or Staff so the broke niggas under us
The way I feel
Everybody in my face cause I got something going on good
Can't help who I'm is
And can't forget where I came from
So big shouts outs to the hood

[Hook]
