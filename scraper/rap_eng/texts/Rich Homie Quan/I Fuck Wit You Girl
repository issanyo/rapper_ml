Hey, big time
Ooh, one
With my back against the rope

Nobody

[Chorus]
Can't judge me girl (Nah)
I won't judge you neither (Uh, uh)

Hotter than a fever (Burning up baby)

You took me back time after time, yeah
Even though I cheated

[Verse 1]
I talk about jail a lot 'cause that made me a man
Tried yo best just to hold me down
I know you did what you can
Pop's always told me
Never depend on another man hand
He say, she say
Never listen to what another man sayin'
But I fuck with you girl
Thinking 'bout putting a baby in you
Then later on just might move with you girl
And ask that name he talking 'bout
Tell that nigga what you really want to do girl
Take you on that shoppin' spree spend 10 thousand
That's just some tennis shoes
Girl, fuck huh, this all for you girl
But you still

[Chorus]
Can't judge me girl (Nah)

[Verse 2]
The next night we was on the phone
You stayed up that ain't nothing new
Me creeping on ya, me sneaking on ya
Me cheating on ya, ain't nothing new
If I fucked up, you come through (Come through)
If you expect me cheating, you run through (Run through)
My text messages, and my call logs
If you don't believe me you gone call my dawg
That ain't fair at all (Nah) I'm in a galleria
I'll tear it down her deep throat (Tear down)
Want a Powerball (Suck it, baby)
Them girls want that x, call it Malcolm (Turn up)
Defensive end I'ma tackle (I'ma tackle)
I'm rushing in, get my sack up (Get money)
No Green Bay but I'ma cheesehead when that pack come
When that pack come these niggas don't know how to act bruh
Smile in yo face, but they gone talk behind yo back bruh
