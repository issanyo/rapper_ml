[Intro]

Sometimes, I just sit back
On my balecony
And I just look at the stars and ask
¨Why?¨
Nah I mean?
I be on some other shit man

[Verse 1]

Aye She want that Jada and Will relationship
I told her, ¨Baby we can be them¨
And we dont need no calendar
Fuck a Monday
´Cause everyday Im her M.C.M
MCM bag I bought her
But she didn´t like it
So I took it back
Then, her lil pretty face got excited
I dont want her ass
I done growed up it dont excite me
I only want a check
No endorsement deal by Nike
Smoking on purple no Viking
I heard yo baby daddy wanna fight me
Tell him pull up, pull up, pull up
They ain't talking ´bout Heroin
Know I shoot up, shoot up, shoot up
I dont wanna lose her, lose her, lose her
So I took her to Dubai
And I flew up, flew up, flew up
She may tell lies but she loyal for sure
I couldn´t get her no Ferrari
So I got her a Porsche
Tell him he lame
But he really can't afford it
I Feel a lil ashamed
For making you have an abortion
Baby mama when you get to naggin
I ignore you
We got matching outfits
Polo
Cause she like to ride dick
Like a horsie
Ass, big, enormous
Big house, flat screens
Everything cordless
Mimi holdin on to that shower pole
Lets make us a sex tape
Ima let my home boy record it
The bitch ain't got sense
She slower than a tortoise
Running from 12
Jumping fences in my new Jordans
That lil Jet waiting out in (?)
Im Breathless
I got one question
And that´s

[Bridge]

Why?
Why?
Why-y-y
My only question is:
Why-y-y (x4)
What you talking bout?
Three letter word
Why

[Chrous]

Why I lie to her?
Why I lie to her?
Oh why-y-y
Why did I cheat on her?
Why did I cheat on her?
I dont know why
Im trying to do better baby
I swear to God, I swear to the Lord
Im trying
You know I dont usually ask questions
But I gotta just know why

[Verse 2]

Why you had to do me like that?
Tell me why you wanna leave me?
I thought you were my babyyy
I ain't seen you in two weeks
Im going crazy
Hate that I feel like this
I dont know what to do
I dont know who to run too
Who am I to trust?
When everybody fuck with
All the same niggas
And the same bitches
Ew!
Nasty!
What am I to do if I can't have her?
I walked out the bank
A hundred bands in plastic
Temp fade nigga
No Webbie, Ima savage
Had to put the lil bitch in time out
Cause she the baddest, baddest
Pin her down, Randy Savage, Savage
She ain't even bad
Why you bragging, bragging?
I pull up with something different everyday
That lil hoe you came with, boy Average
Classic
Boy I pulled up and parked my car
Jurassic, Ew
Niggas tryna kill me
Boy Im feeling like Suge
But they dont wanna try it
Like Tug-of-war
Boy I gotta pull
Icey grape
Boy your diamonds looking dull
My shit straight nigga
Shining like a mug
Everyday I wake up
Boy I thank my Lord
Thank my Lord
And that is Why-y-y

[Bridge + Chorus]
