[Intro: DJ Fresh]
Its funny how people act when you get your money right
In other words
People change up when you get your change up

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
I done seen a nigga change for a little bit of money
Shoulda seen them niggas faces when that money start coming
I done seen a nigga change, cut him out with no discussion
Niggas change everyday, I'm out here looking disgusted
Got that banger on my waist and you know that bitch a Russian
Like a pimple on your face boy that chopper'll get to busting
Bang, bang, bang, bang, all my gun have you ducking
Got quarterbacks in the back field I know these niggas rushing
I'm country with that grammar, no hammer, can't touch me
From GA, Atlanta and my city love me
I done see a nigga change when them hoes come around
Get locked up and lose fame, just make sure you hold it down

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I done seen a nigga change
For that money, for that money, for that money
I done seen a nigga change
For these hoes, for these hoes, for these bitches
I done seen a nigga change
For that money and these bitches but these hoes not loyal
Family even change, they'll act like they don't know you

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
She changed everything I know about her
I swear I can't even do without her
She saw my car and I knew I got her
Back end on lil shawty yeah do the profit)
Back then we run together like (?)
Money didn't make me but I don't know what to do without it
These niggas changing everyday and acting cool about it
These bitches claiming that they straight
But I know you would doubt it
Niggas be smiling in my face when they come around me
Claiming A when you know you from another county
These niggas gay, here (?) hold another yellow flower
Jeans still tight bankroll poking out 'em
The only nigga in first class, feel like Colin Powell
If a nigga get mad (?)
I done seen a nigga change for the money and a bitch
You ran circles around me when you hit that 360

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I done seen a nigga change
For that money, for that money, for that money
I done seen a nigga change
For these hoes, for these hoes, for these bitches
I done seen a nigga change
For that money and these bitches but these hoes not loyal
Family even change, they'll act like they don't know you
