[Chorus]
I lost my mind when I found out my grandma died
To raise a man by herself, yeah my momma tried
To keep me in school, she thought I would go to college
Hangin’ with the wrong dudes, I got off track and I start wildin’
And I learned from my mistakes, so when I move it be silent
You don’t know what I been through no, no, no (you don't know what I been through)
You don’t know what i been through no, no, no (you don't know what I been through)
You don’t know what I been through no, no, no (you don't know what it took nigga)
You don’t know what I been through no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Different niggas change in disguise, you can see the pain in my eyes
The forecast say it might thunder, I can see the rain in the sky
Trap house came wit the shine, Rolex watch came wit the time
You don’t know what I made off of mine (what I made nigga), Tony Hawk, I stayed on the grind
I gotta do numbers, I gotta make it work, 12 years old I jumped off the porch (yeah)
Fresh as hell just to see the judge (what), Gucci button down shirt and Kors
He took a bigger risk when he was sellin’ boy (aye), now he rich and he don’t know who to trust (nah)
Started off when he was on the bus (MARTA), stayed down now the Rollie bust (bitch)
Stayed down and build a legacy, niggas envy, too much jealousy
All this sauce, they want the recipe, but I can’t let them get the best of me
Save ya money, do it for ya fam, hold ya cards, never show ya hand
I tried to care but never gave a damn

[Chorus]
I lost my mind when I found out my grandma died
To raise a man by herself, yeah my momma tried
To keep me in school, she thought I would go to college
Hangin’ with the wrong dudes, I got off track and I start wildin’
And I learned from my mistakes so when I move it be silent
You don’t know what I been through no, no, no (you don't know what I been through)
You don’t know what i been through no, no, no (you don't know what I been through)
You don’t know what I been through no, no, no (you don't know what it took nigga)
You don’t know what I been through no, no, no

[Verse 2]
Hop out with the doors open (woo), trap movin’ slow motion (yeah yeah)
Mean mug wit a cold shoulder (where you at?), I’m in L.A. like I know Kobe (yeah yeah)
I want a Grammy, that’s a gold trophy (uh huh), keep on grinding 'til the globe know me (say what)
Serious face like I'm playin' poker bae, Glock40 gotta keep it close to me
And I ain’t gotta put on, they know I’m paid, I blame my watch every time I know I'm late
I want the money, you can keep the hoe, the fame
She get to cryin' when she talk and know the pain
Car skatin' on roller blades, 20K to walk through and show my face
Put the money up and never show the safe
That how you stay on top (rich homie), what we savin' all this money for (what we savin' all this money for?)
Gotta be a man and face your problems, what you runnin' for (stop being a bitch nigga)
Too many niggas in yo business, that’s how drama come (hold that down bro)
Got in my feelings when they told me 'bout my grandma

[Chorus]
I lost my mind when I found out my grandma died
To raise a man by herself, yeah my momma tried
To keep me in school, she thought I would go to college
Hangin’ with the wrong dudes, I got off track and I start wildin’
And I learned from my mistakes so when I move it be silent
You don’t know what I been through no, no, no (you don't know what I been through)
You don’t know what i been through no, no, no (you don't know what I been through)
You don’t know what I been through no, no, no (you don't know what it took nigga)
You don’t know what I been through no, no, no
