[Intro]
Rich, as in, spirit
Hm, you get it?
I love my family forever, though

[Pre-Hook]
I done been through so much in this past year
But I done took me so much money like a cashier
But I could never forget about where I came from
I ain't jump on no speedboat, I wish I would, and I would have been James Bond

[Hook]
Aston Martin, that's why I pull up
Okay, now stupid bitches every time I pull up
Pocket full of money every time I pull up
And I got like ten bitches in the car with me every time I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
Money stacks to the ceiling when I pull up
Whole lot of bitches in my room when I pull up
I valet my car every time I pull up
Pull up

[Verse 1]
Pull up in a car you ain't never seen, better believe these doors'll pull up
Pull up with a broad you ain't never seen, better believe her dress'll pull up
If a nigga talking shit I don't give a damn who you with, my niggas'll pull up
Hold up, what? Nigga, pull up
First things first that's family, nah, hold up, hold up
I get green like cabbage, shooting at a nigga like the Mavericks
For my family, I do anything for them
Don't play 'bout family, play with them and I shoot any nigga for them, I swear
Tell me, have you ever been in a situation where you don't care?
You know, everybody scared of the truth so they always dare
Tell me, why does it seem like that? Why it gotta be like that?
Fam first, they need my back, they don't know that

[Verse 2]
New car I just pulled up, 2K16, you ain't never seen
Franck Muller watch like, "What up?", diamonds they looking so clean
Walk through the club did the Rich Homie dance moonwalk, that's the new Billie Jean
And just like Mich, I do it for my family
Fam, first, all the time, nigga!
Came back like a nigga left, [?] flex, [?] my fam
No animal, I got a [?] but I still ain't caught the lamb
And my mama love me so much, don't call or tell me, I call the town
And I used to do dirty shit, till I went and took a bath
And I realize when that money gone, I ain't gon' have nobody there for me but family
