[Hook]
I know you think about me
When I'm not around
Cause I loved you
I loved you
But I'm feeling so much better
You're not putting me down
When I loved you
When I loved you

[Verse 1]
Riding down the road, switch lane to lane
Now you're not around, I'm not feeling the same
Flying around the world, meeting all these girls
They love me for the night and nothing else
But I still think about what we had

[Hook]
I know you think about me
When I'm not around
Cause I loved you
I loved you
But I'm feeling so much better
You're not putting me down
When I loved you
When I loved you

[Verse 2]
Looking around the room, there's nothing to find
The love that I need is all inside
I heard that you be still crying
Too damn bad that you were lying
Living in the sky when I'm still flying
I still think about baby if I'm trying too damn hard
To make it back into your, all your little mind games that you play
Wondering if I'm the one that's insane

[Hook]
I know you think about me
When I'm not around
Cause I loved you
I loved you
But I'm feeling so much better
You're not putting me down
When I loved you
When I loved you
I know you think about me
When I'm not around
Cause I loved you
I loved you
But I'm feeling so much better
You're not putting me down
When I loved you
When I loved you

[Bridge]
Feeling so much better you're not putting me down
Hope you think about me when I'm not around
Know you think about me when I'm not around
Know you think about me when I'm not around
Feeling so much better you're not putting me down

[Outro]
When I loved you
I know you think about me
When I'm not around
But I'm feeling so much better
You're not putting me down
When I loved you
I know you think about me
When I'm not around
But I'm feeling so much better
You're not putting me down
When I loved you
I know you think about me
When I'm not around
But I'm feeling so much better
You're not putting me down
When I loved you
I know you think about me
When I'm not around
But I'm feeling so much better
You're not putting me down
