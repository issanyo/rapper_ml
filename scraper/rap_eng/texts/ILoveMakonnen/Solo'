[Hook]
Ridin' in my low-low with nobody beside me
I can do it solo if nobody's riding
Ridin' in my low-low with nobody beside me
I can do it solo if nobody's riding
I can do it solo, I can do it solo
I can do it solo, I can do it solo
I can do it solo, I can do it solo
I can do it solo

[Verse 1]
When you close your eyes you might see it all
Don't miss a chance, you might fall
All your friends don't care 'bout nothin'
Y'all just gettin' drunk and frontin'
By your fuckin' self watchin' somebody else
Make it long all by themselves
That don't mean nothin', nothin' at all
Just keep on drinking, until you fall

[Refrain]
Ridin' in my low-low
Ridin' in my low-low
I'm ridin' solo
Ridin' in my low-low

[Hook]
Ridin' in my low-low with nobody beside me
I can do it solo if nobody's riding
Ridin' in my low-low with nobody beside me
I can do it solo if nobody's riding
I can do it solo, I can do it solo
I can do it solo, I can do it solo
I can do it solo, I can do it solo
I can do it solo

[Verse 2]
Listen
They wonder who's my teacher
My best friend might be the grim reaper
He taught me many and I brought him plenty
We makin' plenty hundreds, I'm talking money
We don't give a damn 'bout nothin' at all
I swear my album better drop this fall
Don't try to play me for another EP
I might drop a mixtape and smash on these

[Refrain]
Ridin' in my low-low
Ridin' in my low-low
I could do it solo
Ridin' in my low-low

[Hook]
Ridin' in my low-low with nobody beside me
I can do it solo if nobody's riding
Ridin' in my low-low with nobody beside me
I can do it solo if nobody's riding
I can do it solo, I can do it solo
I can do it solo, I can do it solo
I can do it solo, I can do it solo
I can do it solo, I can do it solo
