Them niggas tryna sound like who? us? ay, us?
Them niggas tryna sound like who? us? ay, us?
Them niggas tryna sound like who? us? yeah, us?
Them niggas tryna sound like who? us? yeah, us?

[Verse 1]
Nigga I hit the club, all these fucking songs
Sound the god damn same, what the fuck these niggas on?
Boy these niggas lame, out here rapping the same shit
And when I pull up on these niggas, they never have no bricks
Or no weed, or no molly, or no motherfucking coke
Man this shit is not funny, these niggas ain't even got no jokes
Boy they broker than a joke, I'm out here really selling that dope
And I'm talking on tracks, niggas speaking these facts
And my dope is fucking art and nigga, my art is dope
So please don't misconstrue my dope for meaning I'm here selling coke
Cause I do not sell no coke, unless it's Coca Cola that's on me
Water products, no, nigga on us, fucking get a sponsor

[Hook]
Them niggas tryna sound like who? us? ay, us?
Them niggas tryna sound like who? us? ay, us?
Them niggas tryna sound like who? us? yeah, us?
Them niggas tryna sound like who? us? yeah, us?

[Verse 2]
All my fucking songs nigga, watch my flow
And come and see your nigga out here when I'm doing out my show
I be standing on the stage, hit them with the old dances
Like the butterfly and then maybe tootsy roll
Cause this nigga out here snapping, I got bitches who clapping
You know I shut it fucking down when it come to this rapping
Finna wake up in the morning and get back to the trapping
I call my nigga in Atlanta and I call him the captain
Cause that nigga be telling all the boys what to do
We got soldiers in the street who be wearing red and blue
I got soldiers in LA and they look like mamba too
The way them niggas shooting, they should be a number 2
With a 4 on their jersey, tell that nigga, come and hurt me
I be out here in New York, putting Rodman down the jersey
Motherfucker got the best work, nigga it's a damn jerk
Motherfucker on Sunday, I'm still preaching at the damn churches
Serving from the pool pit, nigga ain't on no bullshit
Nigga unless I'm in Chicago wearing my fucking Bulls fit
Nigga what's up though? You know my flow is goddamn sick
That's why a nigga fuck around and god damn throw up on this bitch

[Hook]
Them niggas tryna sound like who? us? ay, us?
Them niggas tryna sound like who? us? ay, us?
Them niggas tryna sound like who? us? yeah, us?
Them niggas tryna sound like who? us? yeah, us?
