[Intro]
Cause this is number one, awww
Oh this the last one we gon' do, yeah
In the meantime
I'mma teach you how to whip, whip
Teach you how to whip it

Teach you how to whip it, whip, whip

[Verse 1]
I teach a cook class on every Thursday
Parking lot at 6' o'clock bumpin' like a church place
I do a driving class on every Sunday
Flip a 4 rider to Hyundai like whats up, man?
They don't know this sound, they never heard it before
We got the lean and the trip all in the front door
Goin' out to stock it, we movin' in and out
Even post man givin' us a fuckin' shout out
I make a GPS stop on a Fed-Ex block
I make a Fed-Ex come back with some Fed-Ex rock
They like "Oh, damn, what's that? How many trucks is pullin' up?"
Pull up in your house, brah, huh?

[Hook]
I said my friend Makonnen is teaching me how to whip it
Teachin' me how to whip, whip, teachin' me how to whip it
My friend Makonnen is teaching me how to whip it
Teachin' me how to whip, whip, teachin' me how to whip it
Teachin' me how to whip, whip, teachin' me how to whip it
Teachin' me how to whip, whip, teachin' me how to whip it
My friend Makonnen is teaching me how to whip it
How to whip, whip

[Verse 2]
I do a private class on every Monday
Turn a little Hyundai back into a new Ferrari
I do my cooking class on every Thursday
Had the church's parking lot bumpin' like my old place, hold up?
They don't like this new shit we do
Cause they so used to these old ass rules
They'll hate on us but it do not phase
These new thing that we give everyday

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Shouts out to Jayquan in the 0626
He brought a mothafuckin' hit and I gave him the shit
And now we ridin' that shit on the spot right now
I got mothafuckas callin' from outta town
What the fuck want bro, I'm really recording a song
I give no damn about what the fuck you people are on
Please don't call me more, I do not have no time
Better hang the phone bitch and find a new line

[Hook]

[Outro]
My friend makonnen is teaching me how to cook
Mr. Baking Soda makin' shit
Yeah, we like having a good time
If you not having a good time then I can teach you how to whip, whip
Teach you how to whip it
