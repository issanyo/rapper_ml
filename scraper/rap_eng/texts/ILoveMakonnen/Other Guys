[Verse 1]
I catch you when you're walkin'
We barely be talkin'
You think I be stalkin'
I'm just interested
Catch you when you're runnin'
You think I be frontin'
But you know that it's somethin'
That keeps me comin' your way
So if you feel the same way
Then maybe I'll stay today

[Chorus]
Cause I'm not like those other guys
I really wanna take the time
If you feel the same, babe
I might stay today
Cause I'm not like those other guys
I really wanna take the time

[Verse 2]
You be broken
Now, really wanna talk with me how
Sometimes we be textin'
You swear I be flexin'
I'm really busy
Flyin' to other cities
I ain't tryna leave you, you alone
So if you if you feel the same way
Then I'll make time to stay

[Chorus]
Cause I'm not like those other guys
I really wanna take the time
If you feel the same, babe
I might stay today
Cause I'm not like those other guys
I really wanna take the time

[Verse 3]
We be rushin' now
I think we should slow it down
Maybe move somewhere out
By ourselves, by ourselves
You think that I'm crazy
You know that I ain't lazy
Cause everything you wanted
I've been out on the hunt
So if you if you feel the same way
Then I'll make time to stay

[Chorus]
Cause I'm not like those other guys
I really wanna take the time
If you feel the same, babe
I might stay today
Cause I'm not like those other guys
I really wanna take the time

You be talkin'
Sayin' I be stalkin'
I just really care a lot
What if I didn't care in your heart?
Would it feel the same way?
You don't even talk the same
They said that you changed your name
Tryna get away, tryna get away
I guess that you don't feel the same
But I guess I'll stay cause

[Chorus]
Cause I'm not like those other guys
I really wanna take the time
If you feel the same, babe
I might stay today
Cause I'm not like those other guys
I really wanna take the time
