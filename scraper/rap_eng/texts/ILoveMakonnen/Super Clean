[Hook]
I make a bitch go dumb
I make a bitch go dumb
I make a bitch go dumb, dumb, dumb
Coke with the rum

[Verse 1]
Pretty girls on my line
Trying to figure out the next time
When I'm gon come around
I be out in every town
A pretty motherfucka' just did GQ
Step in the spotlight like, who are you?
Cause' I don't really give a damn
All my friends like making cash
And they got taxes and taxi's
Out here moving all day like maxi pads
When the bitches get periods
I'm the hottest in the town that's period
Got damn, my girl love me
Your girl love me
She don't put nothin' above me
But.... herself
And that's good for us

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
All my cash be super clean
Make a play on any scene
Still out here swervin' and maneuvering
Motherfucka's like what is you doing?
Nothing at all
Trying to make my money stack tall
Why are y'all hating on us?
We goin' be out here making much
All these girls love the kid
Wanna know if they can have my kid
Said they old man doin' a bid
Said I can be a replacement
Ha, that's a motherfuckin' joke
Smoke my weed I'll make a bitch choke
Damn and I love my money
Shouts out to you cause I love you honey

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I just keep the booth on deck
Bitches like me keep the scoop on deck
So much money I don't care no more
So much black we don't stand no more
All my green is super clean
Loudest of the loud know what I mean
Making [town and say your team]
Hockey jerseys on the scene
MSG on NYE
Tell me if you see a motherfucka' like me
Do it so fast and do it so quick
Make a bitch fuck around and lose her shit
Damn, she done lost her purse
Lost her man and lost her money
Nigga like me out here telling jokes
But I don't see nothing funny

[Hook]
