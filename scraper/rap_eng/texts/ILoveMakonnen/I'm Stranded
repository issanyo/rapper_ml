It's such a cold night
But I'm drinking Pabst cold bunny
This song is for my dad
It's called 'Dad, I'm Stranded'
And this is how it started
I actually don't know how it started
But, um, this is for my dad

I'm stranded
And I need a flight home
I don't feel like calling my dad
But, I'm stranded
And I need a ride home
I wonder if he'll come

I didn't do nothing wrong
I was trying to have a vacation
And it's turned into a staycation
I'm stranded
Daddy I'm stranded
And it's cold in this city
And people kicked me out of their house
Well not really, I just left
Cause I didn't wanna get kicked out
And now I'm stranded
And my cell phone's dying, dad
And I barely know your cell phone number
So hopefully, my cousins will see my Facebook post
And say 'hey, uncle your son's stranded in New York' hehehe
It's alright, cause I've always wanted to be here
So I can't really be mad, so I really don't feel stranded
I'm at home now
