Switching styles, lost in my wave trying to keep up with the child
Steady switching styles
Switching styles, lost in my wave trying to keep up with the child
Steady switching styles

[Verse 1]
Yeah, like I fucked up the red ones in the house
And I brought them blue ones out
And I know I got them fed up
Told the little chumps they could go get they bread up
Niggas do not mention me unless they talking greatness
We don't want to mention you and all your fucking fakeness
Pulled a Ferrari around and switched it to a Jaguar
Slow it down like low rider or riding in a fast car
Hey hey, where ya at?
I don't see ya...

[Hook]
Lost in my ways
Trying to keep up with the child
Lost in my ways
Trying to keep up with the child
Lost in my ways
Trying to keep up with the child
Steady switching styles
Switching styles, lost in my wave trying to keep up with the child
Steady switching styles
Switching styles, lost in my wave trying to keep up with the child
Steady switching styles
Switching styles

[Hook]
Lost in my ways
Trying to keep up with the child
Lost in my ways
Trying to keep up with the child
Lost in my ways
Trying to keep up with the child
Steady switching styles
Switching styles, lost in my wave trying to keep up with the child
Steady switching styles
Switching styles, lost in my wave trying to keep up with the child
Steady switching styles
Switching styles
