It'd make more sense if I could pay my rent, but I'd rather not rent
Been ridin' around in rentals, boy, we get it for fifty cents
Cause niggas got a plug at the travel agency
Nigga know I go off and drop about eighty
In your fuckin' gas tank if you need the gas
A nigga out here at your high school get you high out the class
I'm out her movin' all that new shit, like what is you wantin'?
I keep so much fuckin' green, nigga look like iguana

[Verse 2]
Last Summer we switched up from that little blue Hummer
I pulled up in BMW like nigga, what's uppa?
These niggas know I be eatin' food for breakfast or supper
Don't fuck with them chumps because them niggas is suckers
I'm out here workin' wrist, you know my wrist be a-workin'
I'm out here in California all down in Pomona
A nigga deep in Atlanta dabbin' all fuckin' night
I hang out with the trapzillas when you see me in flight
I'm always countin' the weight, my numbers steady be countin'
I remember deep in the ocean, them ngigas thought I was drownin'
But I was really just feelin' my motherfuckin' self
Because I remember I made all that money off the shelf
And I be flip flop with that mothafuckin' weight
Hit me at your restaurant,  my niggas orderin' the steak
We like fuckin' chicken steak, you know that pork chop is right
I be ridin' off in a new pretty foreign ride

[Hook 2]
My weight flip fop
Money count like tick tock
My weight flip flop
Money count like tick tock
My weight flip flop
Money count like tick tock
Shit, my weight flip flop
My money be count like tick tock
Shit I'm always countin' weight
