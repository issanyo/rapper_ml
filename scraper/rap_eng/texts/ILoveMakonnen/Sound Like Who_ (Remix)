Them niggas tryna sound like who? Us?
Them niggas tryna sound like who? Us?
Them niggas tryna sound like who? Us?

[Verse 1: ILoveMakonnen]
Nigga I hit the club, all these fucking songs
Sound the god damn same, what the fuck these niggas on?
Boy these niggas lame, out here rapping the same shit
And when I pull up on these niggas, they never have no bricks
Or no weed, or no molly, or no motherfucking coke
Man this shit is not fun, these niggas ain't even got no jokes
Boy they broker than a joke, I'm out here really selling that dope
And I'm talking on tracks, niggas speaking these facts
And my dope is fucking art and nigga, my art is dope
So please don't misconstrue my dope for meaning I'm here selling coke
Cause I do not sell no coke, unless it's Coca Cola
Dasani water products, no, nigga on us, fucking get a sponsor

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Hold on, hold on
[?] just started
Boat from the six, god these bitches are horny
Aye these bitches tryna fuck, cause my money is longer
And my change is real, nigga you get the feel
Hold on
36 diamonds are shining too bright, you can get you a picture
Whoa, bitch from the pic got an ass like a [?] but she can't roll like a Swisher
Gimme them racks, I'ma pull up too clean, pull up in a fisker
I might pull up, I might pull off, pull off with your sister
Diamonds they dance like Meechie, Saint Laurent [?]
New Balance on like I'm Gleechie, bow to your knees when you greet me
Whoa, new [?], all these pussy niggas cheesy
Damn, I spent my whole check on my wrist, now my wrist lookin' freezy
All these pussy niggas greasy, that's why I stay with the same niggas who I been with, before I had that, now I got that, and I'm on now
Bitch tried to call my phone, said that she need some, better go now
Bout to go and cop a crip, with a new Italian bitch, up in Rome now
Bout to cop a new [?], that's a foul shot
Balling hard like I'm A.I., pussy nigga don't you dare try
I heard your new song and it sound like pure shit, and you're a lyricist
Broke nigga ain't got a pot to piss, talking bout the diamonds in his wrist

[Verse 3: Larry League]
Coke white whip, call that shit Scott Storch
Hopped up off the porch, Johnny Storm with the torch
I might take off with your bitch, like I'm Clark Kent
Tippin' on .44's, hoe I'm leanin' and I'm bent
You got hits, boy, who you tellin'? I'm so dope they wanna sell me
Flexing pennies, boy you petty
I went through that already
You need to stop like a octagon
See you in the scope bitch I'm lockin' on
Ain't talking money, ain't no response
[?] like Lil Jon
Randy keep the Nino like a fucking nightcrawler
Sippin' baby bottle, but I ain't a fucking toddler
Got that bitch in my palm, I got the world in my hands
Bitch get caught hangin' 'round the gang, cause you's a motherfucking fan
