[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Um, yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
Hey lonely girl
I could be your lonely boy
Waiting for you all alone
Hey lonely girl
I could be your lonely boy
Waiting 'til you come back home

[Verse 1]
I been traveling on the road
Going for days and days
Still thinkin' 'bout my love
Still thinkin' 'bout my bae
Wonder if she feel the same now
Months gone past
Wonder if she felt a replacement
Like I have
But

[Chorus]
Hey lonely girl
I could be your lonely boy
Waiting for you all alone
Hey lonely girl
I could be your lonely boy
Waiting 'til you come back home

[Verse 2]
You've been around the world
Seeing a lot of things
Lately you haven't been seeing me
Can I see your eyes?
Do you look at other guys?
When I'm not in your sight
'Cause I still look for you
Hopin' it'll be a surprise
You're the favorite thing in my sight

[Chorus]
So, lonely girl
Let me be your lonely boy
Waiting for you all alone
Hey lonely girl
I could be your only boy
Waiting 'til you come back home

[Verse 3]
When I see you again
I don't care if it's with friends
I'm gon' give you all my love
I'm gon' give you so many kisses
I know that you been feeling sad 'cause
I'm not around to hold you
I've been feeling the same way

[Chorus]
Lonely girl
I could be your lonely boy
Waiting for you all alone
I could be the only boy
Waiting for my only girl
Waiting here all alone
So, lonely girl
Let me be your lonely boy
Waiting 'til you come back home
Hey lonely girl
Let me be your only boy
'cause baby it's a lonely world
I could be your lonely boy
You could be my lonely girl
'cause baby it's a lonely world
So let me be your lonely boy
And you could be my lonely girl
Out here in this lonely world
Hey lonely girl
Let me be your lonely boy
Waiting for you all alone
I could be your only boy
And you could be my only girl
In this little lonely world
