[Verse 1]

I think my life is a joke, I  might be on to many drugs
I lost so many friends I dint know who to hug
I wander why I, I try
I swear my friend are all good only looking for drugs, all they really want to do is get high
I wonder why do I try
I think my life is a drug sometimes I think my life is a drug sometimes
