[Hook]
I liked you girl and I still do
I wish I had a second chance at lovin' you
Cause I liked you girl and I still do
I wish I had a second chance at lovin' you

[Verse 1]
I remember when you would leave your friends
To spend time with me and cheat on him
I would never lie, wipe tears from your eyes
Now I wonder why in my bed you don't lie

[Hook]
I liked you girl and I still do
I wish I had a second chance at lovin' you
Cause I liked you girl and I still do
I wish I had a second chance at lovin' you

[Verse 2]
Cause you remember when I would leave my friends
To spend some time and hear what's on your mind
I would sneak from your mom hold kisses on your arm
You would hold my hand, say I was your only man

[Hook]
I liked you girl and I still do
I wish I had a second chance at lovin' you
Cause I liked you girl and I still do
I wish I had a second chance at lovin' you

[Bridge]
Cause I be wishin' when I would see you again
So we can be what we used to be back then

[Hook]
I liked you girl and I still do
I wish I had a second chance at lovin' you
Cause I liked you girl and I still do
I wish I had a second chance at lovin' you

[Outro]
I wish I had a second chance
I wish I had a second chance
I wish I had a second chance
At lovin' you
Cause I liked you girl and I still do
I wish I had a second chance at lovin' you
I wish I had a second chance
I wish I had a second chance
I wish I had a second chance
At lovin' you
Cause I liked you girl and I still do
I wish I had a second chance at lovin' you
