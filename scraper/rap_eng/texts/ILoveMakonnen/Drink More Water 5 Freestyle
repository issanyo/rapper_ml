[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Young, whip it, chef, time, get it
Boy I'm back, hold up
Yeah

[Verse]
I just might pull up on your pack and sell that
Young niggas be talking shit, but love my dro, they smell that
Call me on my old phone, nigga, I can't answer
Said you smoking on them cigarettes, I hope you dancing
Round in the town, with them new things
Young boys got blue things
Fuckin' with some new pills, heard they come from China man
Said you got some ecstasy, my niggas tryna get next to me
Bitches out here talking shit but I'm be in Texas, g
All on the weekends, sipping, swerving, leaning
All my shit the best shit, nigga what you meaning
We don't need no features boy, I'm out here being teacher boy
Skyping on your teacher, FaceTime and Snapchat and that
I be smoking dro, on the pole, what the fuck you know
I be in the streets, here for shows, tryna get my dough
Cause I need more, I need more than these fucking shows
Really tryna' pay, tryna' see, 30k a day
Back up on the block again, I got some blocks for my friends
They ain't doing shit but hanging out, in the woods trapping
Tryna' make this shit, who gives a damn about what I'm rapping
Long as that money coming back then they be gift wrapping
On Christmas trees, God dammit, what you need
I'm that nigga round the town like Frosty
Keep that white on my nose, keep that nose on my white
I got a princess, that bitch look like Snow White
Cause we ride around with George crew, all my boys like 5'2
All they come around and have that fuckin' AK on them too
Young niggas getting mad cause they be out here losing dads
Getting locked in fuckin' jail, and they gon' fuckin' break their cell
I'm back up with it too, heard you tryna' get it too
I got like, 22, left going all for two
If you want them, come and get them cause we really need it
I'm just giving something that, I need boy
I'm tired as fuck, I just need some coke
I'mma do another blunt and tell all my jokes
On these fucking beats and make it go on my mixtape
Motherfuckers like "God damn, he's so great"
See me on that documentary, bitch, I got that Noisey loud
See me on my two-way, this the loudest I can see the trap
Oh Goddamn, we be getting fucking super wild
Doing shrooms and LSD, book the kid for boats now
Young boat party, Makonnen like to party
All off out here in the pool, like Lombardi
I be out here in New York, niggas where your shawty
Fucking with them Yankees, motherfuckers come and saw me
Uh, in that drop top, I don't even drop tops
My friends got BMWs that look like space drops
Oh, God damn, niggas like uncle sam be calling me on my phone
Like "God damn, you owe a spare"
I don't owe you shit, nigga, I'm just gonna take that shit
Spend it all on bricks, make it back and probably take a bitch
Out, to Atlanta or I'll probably be Italy
Young niggas like that pasta, yeah they fucking cook for me

[Outro]
I'm done. (laughs)
