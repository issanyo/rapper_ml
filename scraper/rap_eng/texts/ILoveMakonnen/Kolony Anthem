[Intro: Bok Nero]
Yeah yeah, flock
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
What's that, what's that, what's that?
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
(Steve Aoki)

[Verse 1: Bok Nero]
I got lots of gualla, I be gettin' dollars
Sonnin' all these boys like, "Luke, I am your father"
I feel like Darth Vader laughing at these haters
You ain't gettin' money, well, bye bye, I'll see you later
Diamonds in my chain, they got a bunch of different flavors
When I come outside, I swear I cannot see my neighbors
Walk out with my boxers and my robe to grab my paper
House, it is so big I spent and got a lot of acres

[Chorus]
Started out with nothing, it ain't it hard to see
You ain't talkin' money, then don't talk to me
You ain't with the gang, then you can't rock with me
We just turned the gang into a colony
We just turned the gang into a colony
We just turned the gang into a colony
You ain't with the gang, then you can't rock with me
We just turned the gang into a colony

[Drop]
We just turned the gang into a colony
Gang into a, gang into a colony
You, you, you ain't with the colony
We just turned the gang into a colony
We just turned the gang into a colony
Gang into a, gang into a colony
You, you, you ain't with the colony
We just turned the gang into a colony

[Post-Drop]
Yeah yeah, flock
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang

[Verse 2: ILoveMakonnen]
Countin' freckles all night make my fingers hurt
I was never too clean for some dirty work
Ay, they was sayin' somethin' funny (hello)
Nah, they wasn't talkin' 'bout no money
If there's a issue, we could send more bottles
Every party worldwide filled with models
"Super chef, where you goin' next?"
I don't know, wherever there's a check

[Chorus]
Started out with nothing, it ain't it hard to see
You ain't talkin' money, then don't talk to me
You ain't with the gang, then you can't rock with me
We just turned the gang into a colony
We just turned the gang into a colony
We just turned the gang into a colony
You ain't with the gang, then you can't rock with me
We just turned the gang into a colony

[Drop]
We just turned the gang into a colony
Gang into a, gang into a colony
You, you, you ain't with the colony
We just turned the gang into a colony
We just turned the gang into a colony
Gang into a, gang into a colony
You, you, you ain't with the colony
We just turned the gang into a colony

[Outro]
Yeah yeah, flock
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
What's that, what's that, what's that?
Yeah, we just turned the gang into a colony
