Stay alert, stay alert, gotta stay alert
Know too many people who done went to the dirt
Gotta stay alert, stay alert, gotta stay alert
And keep that thing on you when you fuckin' with that work
Gotta stay ale-e-ert
Gotta stay alert
Gotta stay ale-e-ert
Gotta stay alert

[Verse 1: Kickstand]
Lame ass niggas who be hatin' get shot
I don't give a fuck 'bout none of you thots
Young Kickstand, I be juugin' up the block
Fuck that, homeboy I need mine off top
Posted on the east side, trappin' in the trenches
Here come 12, nigga, jumpin' over fences
I don't give a fuck 'bout none of you bitches
Pussy ass nigga I'ma count a roll killer
Young Kickstree, super down street
Crazy gunplay, count a roll, rage
Count a roll homie, catch me juugin' off the stage
Lame ass nigga, we gon' punch him in the face
Catch me in a Range Rove juugin' in the rain
Creepin' up the street, count a roll homie
Pack a whole lot of heat, every day nigga
We gon' grind, we gon' eat
Pussy nigga try me, we gon' beat his ass to sleep
Catch me on the east side juugin' through the east
Juugin' through the west, Young Kickstree pack a whole lot of TECs
Lame ass nigga, we gon' chop his fuckin' neck
Hundred pound bale, breakin' down scales
In and out of jail, send 'em straight to Hell
Put 'em in the mail, I got bales to sell
Say you fell off, oh well

And keep that thing on you when you fuckin' with that work
Gotta stay ale-e-ert

Gotta stay ale-e-ert

[Verse 2: Kickstand]
Fuck wrong with these lil' niggas 'round here talkin' crazy to the kid?
Count a roll, homie everybody know me
Pussy nigga I'll split your damn wig
Young Kickstree, I be juugin' through the 6
Catch me on the east side trappin' on a bench
Smokin' on gas and it look like mist
She comin' home with me if I blow your bitch a kiss
180 in a Lambo, fam moves in that Audi
Take off in a Porsche Carrera, wheelie on a Kawasaki
Take off like a jet, oops, damn I scratched the Benzo
On 285 racin', rip off in my Enzo
Fuck you talkin' 'bout, pussy ass nigga?
Best watch your mouth when you're talkin' to a fuckin' boss
Young Kickstee, first I do the gangsta glide
Then I do the trap slide, then I do the work, toss
First I do the gangsta glide, then I do the trap slide
Then I do the D-Boy walk, I take off and I fly
