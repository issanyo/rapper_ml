Flippin' all night, boy I be flippin' all night

[Verse 1]
Young nigga on the highway still, still
Riding around my homebody keep that still
This shit so for real, seein' that mil'
What city you in? I dunno Victorville
Goddamn my friend got, got all that coke for real
We be out riding to Vegas, that shit be for real
All night, hold up, my shit donâ€™t ever slow up
I'm tryna see a hundred before a nigga throw up
In the room my niggas tripping still
Ay a young nigga really on for real
We all get it, they know
I'm out here still cooking in the kitchen

[Hook]
Flippin' all night, boy I be flippin' all night

[Verse 2]
What's that number on your jersey?
Tell your brother call me
I can get at least a hundred for that, real cheap
If you want it won't you pull up on me?
You could meet me where I'm at
You know I'm posted, homie
All night, my shifts don't start 'til midnight
A nigga keep them Northern Lights, all right
I be super greening like all my shit so bright
I probably have the best out all the white

[Hook]
Flippin' all night, boy I be flippin' all night
I still flip all night, boy I be flippin' all night
Flippin' all night, boy I be flippin' all night
I still flip all night, boy I be flippin' all night
I still flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip
I still flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip
