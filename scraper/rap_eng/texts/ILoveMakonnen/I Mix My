[Intro]
I mix my, I mix my, I mix my, I mix my

[Hook]
I mix my soft with strong, I mix my strong with my soft
Experimentin' every day and every night
Ain't no telling what I'm on
I mix my lean with my green, I'm smoking hard, drinking mean
Enjoying every single day and every night cause
Ain't no tellin' when I'm gone, ain't no tellin' when I'm gone

[Verse 1]
A lot of play on the side of the east tonight
I ride over there in the streets tonight
I need more, more than I had before
I'm tryna' get a house in the Jersey Shore
My friends don't know my name
They say I'm actin' strange
Because I'm all about my money, money every day
I got no time to answer my phone no more
I lost so many friends I don't know no more

[Hook]
I mix my soft with strong, I mix my strong with my soft
Experimentin' every day and every night
Cause ain't no telling what I'm on, ain't no tellin' what I'm on
I mix my lean with my green, I'm drinking hard, smoking mean
Enjoying every single day and every night
Cause ain't no tellin' when I'm gone, ain't no tellin' when I'm gone

[Verse 2]
I got a place on the west we can see tonight
I bet you I can buy a mansion, 3 tonight
I leave it 'lone cause it gettin' risky
I stay at home if it ain't tryna' fit me
My girl don't think I'm doing right
She think I'm slippin' every night
She think I'm sneakin' every night
When I'm just tryna' make it into 5

[Outro]
I mix my soft with strong, I mix my strong with my soft
I'm poppin' pills every day to hide the pain
Ain't no tellin' what I'm on, ain't no tellin' what I'm on
