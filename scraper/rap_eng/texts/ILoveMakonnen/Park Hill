[Verse 1: Povi}

All we seem to feel is//
Even when were trying to//
Dig a little deeper//
Even when were trying to get free//

[Bridge: Povi]

I know were fallin'//
Could be any other way yea'//
Could be any other way yea'//
Could be any other way yea'//

[Chorus: Povi]

Honestly you want me//
Honestly you want me//
Honestly you want me//
Honestly you want me//
Honestly you//

[ILOVEMAKONNEN]

You Know//
You know//
You know//
You know//
You know//

[Verse  2: ILOVEMAKONNEN]

Like what we do it all for//
If I can't even call more//
Baby Tell me where we stand//
You said that i should be yo' man//

[Bridge: Povi]

I know were fallin'//
Could be any other way yea'
Could be any other way yea'
Could be any other way yea'

[Chorus: Povi]

Honestly you want me
Honestly you want me
Honestly you want me
Honestly you want me
Honestly you

[ILOVEMAKONNEN]

You know//
You know//
You know//
You know//
You know//

[Verse 3: Povi]

And when the grey fades to black//
And the lack of you gives me back//
And your still there//
And your still there//
[Repeat Bridge]
