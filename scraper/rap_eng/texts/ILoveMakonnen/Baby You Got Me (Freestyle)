[​Verse 1]
You’ve been running, gunning
Away from us
I’ve been fronting, stunting
To stay with us
You don’t tell me how you feel
I can’t tell if our loves real
You said you just want to go
I'm like I’m not one to ?
But so what
That I don’t do what they do
You don’t act, the same
When I’m alone with you
So what
If you don’t feel how I feel
I don’t care, I’m just here
Trying to keep it reel

[Chorus]
But Baby you got me
Falling in love again
Going back, on my word
Giving you another chance
Baby you got me
Falling in love again
Looking in-to your eyes
Giving you another chance

[verse 2]
Here I am, all alone
Trying to save our love
You think that, I’m a clone
Take a
I can’t stand, when you lie
About, other guys
I’m the one, every night

[Chorus]
But Baby you got me
Falling in love again
Going back, on my word
Giving you another chance
Baby you got me
Falling in love again
Looking in-to your eyes
Giving you another chance

[verse 3]
All those times
You said you would be down
I would smile, cause I knew
You're just talking for fun
All those times
When, I said I would run
You know that, I’ll be back
Before, the sun
[?]
Or when you're in your room
Looking out, into the moon
Ill be thinking of you
All that time, I used to waste
With, other girls
Felt so dumb
Felt so stupid
Felt like someone else

[Chorus]
But Baby you got me
Falling in love again
Going back, on my word
Giving you another chance
Baby you got me
Falling in love again
Going back, on my word
Giving you another chance

Baby you got me
Falling in love again
Looking in-to your eyes
Giving you another chance
Baby you got me
Falling in love again
Going back, on my word
Giving you another chance
Baby you got me
Falling in love again
Looking in-to your eyes
Giving you another chance

Baby you got me
Falling in love again
Going back, on my word
Damn

[Outro]
Baby you got me (oh you got me babe)
Falling in love again
Baby you got me (oh you got me babe)
Falling in love again
Baby you got me (oh you got me babe)
Falling in love again
Looking in-to your eyes
Giving you another chance (baby you got me)
