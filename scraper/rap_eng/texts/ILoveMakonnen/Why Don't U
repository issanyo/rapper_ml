[Intro: ABRA]
Hot boys and Xannies
Sundress, no panties
And we day drunk and we butt rub
And I no sleep like Addies
Is this love, daddy? (daddy?)
Is this love? (is this love?)

[Chorus: ABRA & Father]
Why don't you love me, daddy? (uh, uh)
Why don't you love me, daddy? (uh)

[Verse 1: iLoveMakonnen, ABRA & Father]
You come around and you be trippin' (daddy?)
See you in the club and you always want me tippin'
Take you to the spot, baby, make it hot (spot, *laugh*, hot)
You don't call me back
I wonder what the fuck we got, ayy (yuh, ayy)
See me with them other girls, buying bitches new pearls
You say, "I don't love you"
I'm like, "Girl, give you the world" (the world)
Take you out to Atlanta, show you our bandanas
You be smoking on the gas, all my shit is bananas
Girl—girl—, you acting so damn crazy, I can't even do this shit
I'm 'bout to go out to LA, you trippin' on my bitch
Told you 'bout my west coast hoes (yeah)
Told you 'bout my north side bitch (ayy)
You wanna go to hotel but you can't even act right, bitch

[Verse 2: Father & ABRA]
I fell in love in a Uber (uh, love me...)
She only fuck with them shooters (daddy?)
Why you still fuck with them Xannies she asked me
'Cause I fell in love with the stupor (*laugh*)
Percocet keeping me lucid
Blackouts, they give me excuses
You know you want to do it go ahead and then do it
Pass out and wake up in her fluids
Hit the night life and I fuck off (yuh)
Let's hit the restroom and duck off
Walk in the party like fuck everybody
They just wanna see us all fall off
I'm tired of looking for love
As much as I'm tired of looking for drugs
I'm tired of being high all the time
To convince niggas, I give a fuck
I just want these riches, been grew tired of all these bitches (uh)
On my dick like broomsticks, wicked witch of zone 6 (uh, ayy)
What you gone do, can't say no (yuh, uh, say no)
And them feelings start to show (uh, to show)
Girl, I really need to know, yeah

[Chorus: ABRA & Father]
Why don't you love me, daddy? (uh, uh, heh, yeah, yeah)
Why don't you love me, daddy? (uh, yeah)
Why don't you? Why don't you? (uh, yeah)
Why don't you love me, daddy? (uh, uh, yeah, ayy)
Why don't you love me, daddy? (uh, what?)
Why don't you? Why don't you? (uh, yeah)
Why don't you love me, daddy? (uh, uh, yeah, yeah)
Why don't you love me, daddy? (uh, yeah)
Why don't you? Why don't you? (uh, yeah)
