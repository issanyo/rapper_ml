[Verse 1]
God damn what they say
Like I can't catch a break
Every single day these niggas tryna catch me wave
But they can't do it like I do
Never have no fuckin' shows and my songs don't sound like you, no, uh
I been whipping for ever
Deep out in the ocean, boy, my shit is so damn clever
Yeah, stunting all the time
Riding in that orange thing, turn a bitch blind
Orange Camero, boy, look like Finding Nemo
I been doing numbers all night like the casino
Deep out in Reno, got the best gas
When I ride past, no wonder that they mad

Make these god damn beats you would think I'm DJ Mustard
In these god damn streets I kill 'em every fuckin' night
I go HAM in the daylight and I go HAM in the night
This boy is out here stupid, boy, somebody come and get the kid
We should put him in school and wonder try to teach the kid
A new fuckin' lesson cause this shit is a weapon
I be out here going off like a Smith and Weston
Junkies do the monkey tumble, nigga know I rumble, ugh
I been out here breaking weed down with the crumble, ugh
Nigga know I'm stunting hard on every fuckin' boulevard
Out here in that ocean thing, shouts out to my ocean gang
