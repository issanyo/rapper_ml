[Intro: Jessie J]
You are listening to Chase Atlantic, yeah

[Verse 1: Mitchel Cave]
I ain't got no friends in this
Please just stay away I feel aggressive
I know I asked politely but I'm anxious
And I don't need you preaching 'bout whatever
I might lose my shit and leave forever

[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
I ain't got no friends on the guest list, nah
I ain't got no friends on my mattress, nah
I ain't got no friends, oh you an actress?
Act this
Walk the fuck away and don't look back, bitch

No friends, no friends, no friends
No friends, no friends, no friends
Please don't be so upset
No friends, no friends, no friends

[Verse 2: K CAMP]
No, no friends
Can't trust nobody no-no
I win, I can't pretend watch me jump out this photo
Shorty in love with the coco
These internet niggas free promo
Got hoes New York like LOSO
Can't trust these niggas they so-so
Why you all in my face for a photo?
When I know you been hating on the low-low
These niggas too lame they bozos
$100K for a show, that's more dough

[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
I ain't got no friends on the guest list, nah
I ain't got no friends on my mattress, nah
I ain't got no friends, oh you an actress?
Act this
Walk the fuck away and don't look back, bitch

No friends, no friends, no friends
No friends, no friends, no friends
Please don't be so upset
No friends, no friends, no friends

[Verse 3: iLoveMakonnen]
I just went back home, so many did me wrong
Smiling in my face, tryna sing my song
Play me like a fool, saying that we cool
Had to leave them fakes, got rid of the snakes
Yes, the boy got jealous of the man
Super chef, had to teach 'em one again
Money back feelin' romantic
Chase across the Atlantic
Work to bad that's why I whip it
I'm out here lookin' terrific
I can take your broad, whole team is some frauds
I'll keep doing me, Y'all keep doing Y'all
Do not hit my line, do not think to call
I ain't got no time cause I ain't got no friends

[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
I ain't got no friends fuck a guest list, yeah
I ain't got no friends on my mattress, no way
I ain't got no friends, oh you an actress?
Act this
Walk the fuck away and don't look back, bitch

No friends, no friends, no friends
No friends, no friends, no friends
Please don't be so upset
No friends, no friends, no friends
