[Verse 1: Father]
All these hoes on me
Whoa is me
Amerie on repeat
All I want is one thing
It's just thing that got me slipping
Falling in, I can't get up
Pop another pill
I ain't sick of nothing
Just need pick-me-up
Another girl hit my line up like "boy come pick me up"
Dick her down
Then drop her off at lost and found
When I'm not around do you even long for me
When I'm coming down you don't feel like you belong to me
