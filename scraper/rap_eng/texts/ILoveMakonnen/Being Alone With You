[Verse 1]
I gotta go for the zone, get it all for the low
Wonder where the fuck I'm at if I'm not doing these shows
I wonder if she really love me if she knew about my hoes
I wonder if she gonna be there if I didn't have all these shows
I be flying in the air, still using my phone
I be even tryin' to call, call back to her home
But she don't care about that, no not at all
She just want me be home, but I'm not

[Hook]
It ain't nothin' better
It ain't nothin' better
It ain't nothin' better
It ain't nothin' better
Than being alone with you
Being alone with you
Being alone with you

[Verse 2]
I ain't even hit the mall no more
I shop at the house
I just buy shit online like I work for a spouse
I swear I'm just tryna keep it quiet like I'm a mouse
But the trap be always calling when that young kid be out
I'm like damn I should slow up
Hold up let me roll up
If my bro got some lean
Then goddamn let me pour up
Who the fuck gon' stop us?
Ain’t nobody robbin' us
Fuck around with my homeboy they turn into them robbers
Oh shit, we legit, out here fuckin' all these bitches
Nigga might steal your bitch, out here in all these cities
Why the fuck should I quit when my girl be steady calling?
She like, "I swear to God, boy I wonder if you're falling"
Nah I ain't falling for none of these girls
I'm out here tryna make this money so we can travel the world
I swear I think about you all the time
But think about my goddamn grind
But in the meantime baby

[Hook]
It ain't nothin' better
It ain't nothin' better
It ain't nothin' better
It ain't nothin' better
Than being alone with you
Being alone with you
Being alone with you

[Verse 3]
I wonder if she still there
Wonder if she still care
Said I was your teddy bear, well wonder if you're still here
Leave me like your old teddy bear in the basement
Now you hanging out, I heard you found a new replacement
Young boy who got braces and treat you way better
Said that he got way more money, he like spending cheddar
On them finer things, give you all them diamond rings
He don't love you like I love you
He can't sing like I sing

[Hook]
It ain't nothin' better
It ain't nothin' better
It ain't nothin' better
It ain't nothin' better
Than being alone with you
Being alone with you
Being alone with you
It ain't nothin' better
It ain't nothin' better
It ain't nothin' better
It ain't nothin' better
Than being alone with you
Being alone with you
Being alone with you
Being alone with you
It ain’t nothin better
