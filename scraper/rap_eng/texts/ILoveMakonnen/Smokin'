Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse 1: iLoveMakonnen]
I ride away, until the end of day, all alone I don't ever
Think that I can claim a throne unless I'm fucking going on
A plane a week everybody know I got what you need
Like tell me what you need baby, If you really smoking, 'cause
I'd like to laugh, but, right now I'm not joking
You see me riding big, but them rims ain't spoken
Yeah, 'cause

[Hook: Lil Peep]
Heart wide open, worlds get broken
Girls get soakin', when we walk up (We walk up)
Everybody frozen, when we walk up (We walk up)
Hearts get broken, when we walk up (We walk up)
Girlfriends glowing, when we walk up
Ex bitch choosing, when we walk up (We walk up)
Everybody frozen, when we walk up (We walk up)
When we walk up
Yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Peep and Makonnen, everybody know that
Came with your girlfriend left with your boyfriend
Yeah, yeah, yeah.. Peep and Makonnen, everybody
Know that came with your girlfriend left with your boyfriend
Yeah, yeah, yeah..
