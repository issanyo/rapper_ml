[Intro]
Yeah
Hello
Yeah there we go
Lolo

[Verse 1: Rome Fortune]
In reality all I need is you
Pick a pocket with a hundred
I don't need a crew neither
Nor a two liter or another boo
Lets get this gwap together if you're staying true
I like model bitches
And all kinds of bitches when I'm high
When I'm grounded bitches
Just the sound of bitches make me fly
I prefer some sticking on my (?) if Imma close my eyes
Baby I'm just kidding but you're different
Please don't fake me out
Pussy killed the best of us
But please don't let it take me out
Shit
Pussy killed the best of us
But please don't let it take me out
I said

[Hook: iLoveMakonnen]
'Cause you take me away
Girl you take me away
Take me away
Why would I stay
You take me away
You take me away
It takes me away
It takes me away
Why would I stay
You take me away

[Verse 2: Rome Fortune]
I said
Look
I said
In reality all I need is you
Pick affection also loving
I ain't gotta me either
Just a few demons leaning on me too
But I'll never let them surface if I stay with you
Shit I like timeless (?)
Knocking to my senses when I'm high
I'm surrounded by the universe
But that mean you and I
They can clown me
Shit and I rebound a bit, because you're fly
Making sounds and shit
But also sounding shit ain't gonna never die
Never lie
Never ever lie
I mean never I
Always buy a ticket if you take me away
I said
Never lie
Never ever lie
Always buy a ticket if you take me away
I said

[Hook: iLoveMakonnen
You take me away
You take me away
Being with you babe takes me away
Takes me away
It takes me away
Takes me away
You take me away
Being with you babe, it takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away

[Verse 3: Rome Fortune]
