[Verse 1: Skepta]
Coming soon, coming real soon
My lawyer said I'mma touch a mil soon
I'm the man of the year and it's still June
All the girls standing in the line for a real goon
Fuckin' good, coming soon
Shutdown, that's a fuckin' tune
I heard your tape and you ain't sayin' nothin' new
We're talkin' money, boy, we ain't discussin' you

[Verse 2: Skepta]
One day when I was in my mother's womb
My dad said "hope you know there's greatness coming soon"
They took my fingerprints, they put me in a room
But my visa coming soon, revenge coming soon
Who can they name in the US? Everybody gonna say "You, S"
Reluctantly 'cause most them rappers don't fuck with me
Feeling like Jay in '96, they can't fuck with me
Dropped Konnichiwa, that's the Blueprint, now you're stuck with me

[Verse 3: Skepta]
We predicted you would switch up
When we made the plan, dickhead
See them fuckin' with my style when I'm in Japan
'Cause the man makes the clothes
The clothes don't make the man
I bow my head, they say Konnichiwa and shake my hand
Yeah, we turned Glastonbury into a Laigon party
Pyramid stage, now they think I'm Illuminati
I'll give your girl that Slick Rick, that la-di-da-di
Tell your mummy, tell your sister, your auntie, we're coming soon
