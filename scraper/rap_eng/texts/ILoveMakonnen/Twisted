I took a pill, then a little of the white
Fuck around in the morning
Going to have to take my flight back
Home to the motherfucking south
I've been talking so much, I made a million with my mouth
Plays every day on the highway
Nigga out here get it, 'bout five way
On Sunday to motherfucking Monday
Every Saturday just turn to a fun day
I count it, I count it
Then I spend
I fuck around then I'm going to turn around again
Cuz I picked a pack up, then dipped it back out
Ayy, ayy

Pure white shimmy shimmy, yay

Mix it with the K
Now I feel all right
Diamonds all white, brighter than the torch lights
Tats on my face, yeah I got tats on my face
Days on my back, I ain't been back
I've landed in space, putting my pace
I haven't said grace

I'm in the back of the wraith
With a man who swinging

You got me flexin', in my ride
She got me flexin' baby girl in my ride
Cut the lights on 'em
She be licking all night, lay the pipe on 'em
We be cooking all night, roll the dice on 'em
Poppin' molly, but I had to put the rice on 'em
She said "Baby girl, I probably got some bites on 'em"
