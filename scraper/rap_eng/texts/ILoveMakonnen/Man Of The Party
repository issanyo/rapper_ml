[Hook]
I'm the man of the party
Keep the Xan and the Molly
I keep the kush and the purp
Always on deck, never out of work
Damn, I'm the man of the party
Keep the Xan and the Molly
I keep the kush and the purp
Always on deck, never out of work](4875874)

[Verse]
Yeah, we like to party, your life been feelin' sorry
And we gon' give it to you the way you want it
You gon' buy this here and we gon' step up on it
You been playing with nose candy
You don't wanna go to Roseland
You got memories of that Rosewood
You been hanging with that white girl, I said she's no good
She keep on tricking you, you keep on tricking me
I keep on making money, I keep on seeing C
Notes and I play piano too
But I don't play the way you do, see

[Hook]
I'm the man of the party
Keep the Xan and the Molly
I keep the kush and the purp
Always on deck, never out of work
Damn, I'm the man of the party
Keep the Xan and the Molly
I keep the kush and the purp
Always on deck, never out of work

[Bridge]
They like to party, damn
We like to party, shit
You see, you see

[Hook]
I'm the man of the party
Keep the Xan and the Molly
I keep the kush and the purp
Always on deck, never out of work
I'm the man of the party
Keep the Xan and the Molly
I keep the kush and the purp
Always on deck, never out of work
