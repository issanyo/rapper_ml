Universal girl
International players
Out here getting dough
Keep winning like the Lakers
My friend makonnen is teaching me how to cook
My friend makonnen is teaching me how to cook
Backseat driver dirty dirty Sprite drinkin
Out here gettin tore up in the house they're creating
My friend makonnen is teaching me how to cook
My friend makonnen is teaching me how to cook
All around the world
And you done seen a lot of things
But you don't think about that
When you're dancing with me
Now I done seen a lot of worlds
And I've been through some things too
But I don't think about that
When I'm dancing with you
Costa Rica lover girl
Come back to the USA
Hit me on my iPhone
I will tell you where I stay
If I move you can meet me where I'm at now
And girl I wanna sit down
And have a conversation
So I can propose to you
In my mind you know I'm probably drugged out three times
But that ain't shit to brag about
I'm so depressed being here in the South
Won't you come and save my life
I'm out here making songs
I don't even think they sound right
Don't give a fuck
I'ma put them out
Don't give a fuck who hatin on 'em
Motherfuckers keep talkin shit
I know they wish they was fuckin creating on it
And that's just on my stupid shit
I really ain't doin' shit
Just at the house thinkin bout
How I'ma get up out the south
How much doze they talkin bout?
Damn, this is for my universal girl
International players
Out here getting dough
And keep winning like the Lakers
Tell em
My friend makonnen is teaching me how to cook
My friend makonnen is teaching me how to cook
All around the world
And we done seen a lot of things
But you don't think about that
When you're dancing with me
Cuz I done been in some worlds
And I done seen some things too
But I don't think about that
When I'm dancing with you
My friend makonnen is teaching me how to cook
My friend makonnen is teaching me how to cook
My friend makonnen is teaching me how to cook
Mix the baking soda with it make a few bucks
You're momma probably's like
What the fuck
Have you done with my kitchen?
You know they're out there snitchin
So put that baking powder away
And think about a different thing to save your ass today
Start creating with that mind
Use more than 10 percent
Following 50 Cent
Like, damn nigga retweet me
Motherfuckers don't even speak to me
I been creating before I heard what 50 Cent was
Love it if it was 2 quarters in real life
And my motherfuckin bus fare
Who cares?
Motherfuckers wasn't never there
Who wears
These colors for your brother
Who fuckin got shot
Or them colors for your sisters
Who was at the wrong spot
When shit got hot
Motherfuckers couldn't control themselves
They don't even know what's their real wealth
Thinkin that a gold chain
Gonna change everything
When you got more than a gold mine
Inside your own damn mind
How many times do I have to rhyme?
