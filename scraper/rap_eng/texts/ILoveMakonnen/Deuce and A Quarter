Hook:
Hoop there it is
Deuce and a quarter have no fear (4x)

Verse 1:
I started saucin
She got lost in
Dealin with a bossman
She keeps it loyal
Ain't no lines crossing
Buzz cut season
Got the party swingin'
We be royals
I keep her flossing

Corners flippin hard
I'm pushing weight down boulevards
Swerving out back
Supa cheffin' stay manuvering
Gas and that lean
I got the blue and the green
I'm the man of the party
She keep it blazay

Damn on any weekday
Got yo girl up in the club--a gucci renegade
Supply you with that fever on a Tuesday
And we collecting freebandz on Friday damn

Hook (1x)

Post hook:
And I'm gone and I'm gooooone
And I'm on and I'm ooooonnn
Ain't never stalling

Verse 2:

We roll thru
We strap down
Juggs moving like a couple pounds
Putting marks down while I'm making my rounds
Catch a body lost and-- (found)

Entrepenuer up in the game
Mind of a hustler
One and the same
My code of ethics mad strong
I gained respect got paid
Put in work that's self made
"Mr. I put up numbers D-Wade. Superfly above the clouds, Newton James."

I'm just here to celebrate
While I sip my tangorade
With my jesus piece on
Lucky charmin loosely

Crusing down the street in my candy green
Watch that lean
Top down 4 eighteens (4 eighteens)

Got dat gasoline blowing O's
We tipping 44
Wrapped in 4 vouges
We capping status quo
For the moment
We own it
All attention stolen
All opponents and acquaintences
All the haters frozen

Pre hook:
And I'm gone and I'm gooooone
And I'm on and I'm ooooonnn
Ain't never stalling

Hook (1x)

Post hook:
And I'm gone and I'm gooooone
