I got coke and I got lean, I got K on the way
A young nigga in the USA, I'm movin' the yay
I got bitches out of town, who like "Aye where you stay?"
I be like "Hold up, I'm about to come out to LA"
I keep that code off in my coat, I keep that coke in my coat

You know my shit out here stupid look like dump trucks

Fuckin' listening to new jams
Damn I'm sellin' thirty grams
All for the high, high
Nigga out here in the kitchen
Cookin' like I'm Popeyes
Oh shit, on the spinach

Out here moving weight
All day, what fuck you want?
If you ain't buying shit, nigga do not call me
Hey, hey, bitch ain't gon' ever caught me
I'm sellin', I'm sellin', give a fuck 'bout who tellin'
All my friends is dope fiends or three time felons

[Verse 3]
Keep that code off in my coat, I keep that coke in my coat
I'm out here ballin' on a nigga, I will come for your throat
We slash and dash all damn night, nigga meet me with my sprite
I got lean, I got white, I got whatever you need
At the Taco Bell or highway, nigga come and see us
I be out here moving all night in two seaters
Little silver Cameros, fuck about your fellows
Feeling like an ancient Egyptian, looking like a pharaoh
