[Chorus 1]
I've been down for so long
And I've been keeping it too real
So i'ma say what I want
And I don't care how you feel
No I don't care how you feel

[Verse 1]
I lost my friends in '07
Every night I pray to God they made it to heaven(yeah)
Cause I've been going through the worst
Having visions that I'm leaving in a hearse,next

[Chorus 2]
But I've been down for so long
And I've been keeping it too real
Yeah I've been keeping it too real
I've been keeping it too real
So I'ma say what I want
And I don't care how you feel

[Verse 2]
When I was all alone
I cut myself a new deal
I've been having spiritual wars lately
It ain't easy

[Chorus 2]

I've been keeping it too real(x2)

[Chorus 3]
I've been down for so long
And I've been keeping it too real
I've been keeping it too real
Yeah I've been keeping it too real
So I'ma say what I want
And I don't care how you feel
No I don't care how you feel
Because I've been down for so long
And I've been keeping it too real
Yeah I've been keeping it too real(x2)
So I'ma say what I want(yeah)
And I don't care how you feel
No I don't care how you feel(x3)
Because I've been down for so long
And I've been keeping it too real
Yeah I've been keeping it too real
