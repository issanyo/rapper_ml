Don't let my tongue deceive me

Loving you ain't no ease

I try to bring you peace lovin u is like a beast

U got the heart of the middle east

They always fightin for fightin for fightin for u

Always got my mind on mind on mind on u

When i first heard about u

I was really young

Been studyin u for a while, but it really ain't no fun
