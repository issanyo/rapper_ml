[Intro]
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Yeah, uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Got no work this season
Can't give you a reason
I don't have no lies to tell
Steady workin' at the show and tell
My friends out here losing much
I been seated, losing touch
Out here working at the Shell
Hurt my girlfriend, making bail

[Chorus]
So my friend Makonnen, teach me again
How to make it disappear like magician
Hit the pot with the left and make it do what it do
Swing the fork with it right and you can super chef too
My friend Makonnen, teach me again
How to make it disappear like magician
Hit the pot with the left and make it do what it do
Swing the fork with it right and you can super chef too

[Verse 2]
Heard you got hundred in the car
Riding all night like super stars
You don't care 'cause you need more
Talkin' cash or pesos
Goin' out of town with those bags
Told my mama not comin' back
Unless I got more than I could stash
I'm out here itching for the money like a rash

[Chorus]
My friend Makonnen, teach me again
How to make it disappear like magician
Swing the pot with the left and make it do what it do
Hit the fork with it right and you can super chef too
My friend Makonnen, teach me again
How to make it disappear like magician
Hit the pot with the left and make it do what it do
Swing the fork with it right and you can super chef too

[Verse 3]
I don't have no reason
To not be in this season
Workin' hard like all the time
I'm out here on the grind
People out here hating, we don't care
Steady goin' off and up in here
Makin' plenty money, none to share
It's gettin' kinda frightening, I'm so scared

[Chorus]
So my friend Makonnen, teach me again
How to make it disappear like magician
Swing the pot with the left and make it do what it do
Hit the fork with it right and you can super chef too
My friend Makonnen, teach me again
How to make it disappear like magician
Hit the pot with the left and make it do what it do
Swing the fork with it right and you can super chef too

[Outro]
Hey, and you can super chef too
Swing the fork with it right and you can super chef too
Hit the pot with the left, make it do what it do
Swing the fork with the right and you can super chef too
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
