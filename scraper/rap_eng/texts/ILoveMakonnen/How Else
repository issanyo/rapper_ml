[Intro: iLoveMakonnen]
Yeah

[Hook: iLoveMakonnen]
I'm tired of all this whippin' in the kitchen, but
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
I put her in Givenchy
I got these bitches trippin'
Was young, I wanted a Bentley
I promise I'm gon' whip it
How else am I gon' get it?
I had to trap in a vacant
Swerving a Rari in Vegas
Mama we finally made it
Walking with the racks, I'm a trapstar
She ride me like a pornstar
I'mma stack the bricks in the backyard
Taught her how to whip it, turn the white hard
I can't take her on a date, this ain't chicken dinner
Put my wrist in the pot, I could make it flip up

[Hook: iLoveMakonnen]
I'm tired of all this whippin' in the kitchen, but
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
I'm getting kinda tired of all this cooking in the kitchen, ooh
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?

[Post Hook: Instrumental Break & iLoveMakonnen]
Whip
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
Whip
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get-get-get-get

[Bridge: iLoveMakonnen]
Whip
You know my shit is the best
I feel like I should stop and retire as a vet
And probably maybe put on a new shit
Oh, god damn I'm in a cruise ship

[Hook: iLoveMakonnen]
I'm tired of all this whippin' in the kitchen, but
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
I'm getting kinda tired of all this cooking in the kitchen, ooh
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?

How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?

How else am I gon' get it?
How else am I gon' get it?
