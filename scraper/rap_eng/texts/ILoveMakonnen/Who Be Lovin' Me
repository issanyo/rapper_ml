[Intro: Santigold]
This one goes out to all of you around the world who know what you want and go get it
We don't got time for wasting time. Do it!

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
So tell me, dear, what's it gonna be?
Cause I got girls around the world who be lovin' me
So tell me, dear, what's it gonna be?
Cause I got girls around the world who be lovin' me
Yeah I got girls who be lovin' me
Yeah I got girls around the world who be lovin' me
Yeah I got girls who be lovin' me
Yeah I got girls around the world who be lovin' me

[Verse 1: ILoveMakonnen]
I had to swerve on little mama cause she out here with that llama
Alpaca on my arm, I'm stayin' warm in any storm
A super chef with the snow captain
Out here, move it, make it happen
Drop the top on 'em like, "Oh goddamn, what happened?"
Hair be goin', curls be blowin', girls be goin' crazy, hon
See me in your city playin' shows at the stadium
Songs be goin' up and down and turnin' smiles from your frown
I just wanna get you now (now), now

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen and Santigold]
So tell me, dear, what's it gonna be?
Cause I got girls around the world who be lovin' me
So tell me, dear, what's it gonna be?
Cause I got girls around the world who be lovin' me
So tell me, dear, what's it gonna be?
Cause I got boys around the world who be lovin' me
So tell me, dear, what's it gonna be?
Cause I got boys around the world who be lovin' me

[Verse 2: Santigold]
Talkin' 'bout what we had, I been turned off
Come in my house, I win, you lost
Got no time to hear you out, my shit takin' off
Won't be around to take your phone call
Call me a fashion bae, lil' me
I be pullin' stunts from Princeton, Japan
Say I'm the shit, 20 languages
Picture that, compute if you can
My world got body, that skin's the law
My talkin' rowdy like rub and tuck
Back home say i always seem wild
Got my name in lights up right now
Baby I don't need your love, see me knee deep
Up in a sea of those love letters
I ain't likin' that thing called love
And this here, what I'm a jetsetter...
Jetsetter...

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen and Santigold]
So tell me, dear, what's it gonna be?
Cause I got girls around the world who be lovin' me
So tell me, dear, what's it gonna be?
Cause I got girls around the world who be lovin' me
Yeah I got girls who be lovin' me
Yeah I got girls around the world who be lovin' me
Yeah I got girls who be lovin' me
Yeah I got girls around the world who be lovin' me
So tell me, dear, what's it gonna be?
Cause I got boys around the world who be lovin' me
So tell me, dear, what's it gonna be?
Cause I got boys around the world who be lovin' me
Yeah I got boys who be lovin' me
Yeah I got boys around the world who be lovin' me
Yeah I got boys who be lovin' me
Yeah I got boys around the world who be lovin' me
