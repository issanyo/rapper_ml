[Intro]

Break it into three
Number oneee!

[Hook] x2
I make a brick stop, freeze
Break it into three
Piano class
Cause I'm playin with keys
Outta town gettin coastal
Mail commin back in the Postal

[Verse 1]
I use to live on the West side
The mothfafuckin South Central L.A
I use to do what nobody did
Just to make it to see another day
I had gang bang friends
And Prostitute girlfriends
Makin money when they can on the whirlwind
Its so fast its so mothafuckin dangerous
But ain't nobody in America savin us
Ooo my bad damn lets be real though
I had to accomplish super typa dope flow
Just to get a mothafucka to listen now a days
Its crazy how these mothafuckas pray now a days

Thats grant for jewels, money, cars
A nasty lil bitch who likes to starve
Avenues and boulevards
Ain't never had seen all these scars
They don't get Neosporin or no fuckin peroxide
Too bad is mothafuckin hot outside
Mothafucka still sellin rocks and shit
And I ain't got time, Ima get mine

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
I ain't have no time for the FBI
I use to think about the CIA
Until I found out on Thursday
That the CIA lookin my way

So I stop..Freeze..Break it into three
