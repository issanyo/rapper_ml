[Hook: ILoveMakonnen &  Father]
I need a hunnid million before Summer, nigga
Finna pull up in that all black hummer, nigga
I don't care how much it cost
If I want it, boy I cop
If she want it, boy I cop
Look like episode of COPS
I need a hunnid million before Summer, nigga
Finna pull up in that all black hummer, nigga
I don't care how much it cost
If I want it, boy I cop
If she want it, boy I cop

[Verse 1: Archibald Slim]
Black as fuck, we're all goths, my PM look all shot
Drive that bitch for 'bout a month, ridin' dirty, call the cops
Leave the money, boy I'm rushin', hush until the song pops
Song drop still I'm gettin' it, but fuck it the song flop
Cause (?) gon' top whatever you're talkin' 'bout
Stringin' shit together, where the facts, porshe just run they mouth
Dipped in bronze, step aside, gourmet city, your words just wine
Talkin', talkin', talkin', now we turnin' dollars outta dimes, bitch

[Verse 2: Ethereal]
Mat black hummer, nigga soo hot
Pull up, they say it's the Summer
Paypal lookin' crazy, all these numbers, trap- back, jumpin'
Need a hunnid thousand right now and it's comin' back
Cop another crib, I don't even stay in it
Pop another pill, she say "baby, play wit it"
Awful on the paper, that's an awful lot of paper
Still ridin' scrapers, while your main nigga hatin'
Bitch, what's good?

Makonnen need that hunnid mil, me, that 65 devile
All black, yeah, it's hell on wheels
White G Wagon too for me the kids and the boo
And two 96 impalas, cause mama wants her one too
Hydraulics, refurbished, I-20 blowin' out herb
Swervin' and swingin' 'round curbs
Blastin' Carti you ain't heard yet
Headed to the burbs, goods In the trunk
My nigga say go run it
Aye, boy we gon' run it
Super sonic, 12 stop me, hooked on phonics
How are you doing today, sir?
Was I speeding? my apologizes
Speak good English, bitch, don't let it fool ya
I lose my cool and I bet you somebody pull out they tool, yeah
