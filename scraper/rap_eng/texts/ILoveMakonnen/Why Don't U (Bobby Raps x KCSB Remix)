[Intro: Abra]
Hot boys and Xanies
Sun dress no panties
And we day drunk
And we butt rub
And I no sleep like Addies
Is this love, daddy?
Is this love?

[Hook: Abra]
Why don't you love me daddy?
Why don't you love me daddy?
Why don't you? Why don't you?
(x4)

[Verse 1: I Love Makonnen]
You come around and you be trippin'
See you in the club and you always want me tippin'
Take you to the spot
Baby make it hot
You don't call me back
I wonder what the fuck we got
See me with them other girls
Buying bitches new pearls
You say I don't love you
I'm like girl give you the world
Take you out to Atlanta
Show you all bandanas
You be smoking on the gas
All my shit is bananas
Girl you acting so damn crazy
I can't even do this shit
I'm bout to go out to LA
You trippin on my bitch
Told you bout my west coast hoes
Told you bout my north side bitch
You wanna go to hotel
But you can't even act right bitch

[Hook: Abra]
Why don't you love me daddy?
Why don't you love me daddy?
Why don't you? Why don't you?
(x4)

[Verse 2: Father]
I fell in love in a Uber
She only fuck with them shooters
Why you still fuck with them xannies she asked me
Cuz I fell in love with the stupor
Percocet keeping me lucid
Blackouts they give me excuses
You know you want [to] do it go ahead and then do it
Pass out and wake up in her fluids
Hit the night life and I fuck off
Let's hit the restroom and duck off
Walk in the party like fuck everybody
They just wanna see us all fall off
I'm tired of looking for love
As much as I'm tired of looking for drugs
I'm tired of being high all the time
To convince niggas I give a fuck
I just want these riches
Been grew tired of all these bitches
On my dick like broomsticks
Wicked witch of zone 6
What you gone do when you can't say no
And them feelings start to show
Girl I really need to know, yeah

[Hook: Abra]
Why don't you love me daddy?
Why don't you love me daddy?
Why don't you? Why don't you?
(x4)
