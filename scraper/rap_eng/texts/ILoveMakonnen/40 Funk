[Chorus]
40 got me funky (funky)
I popped a molly (molly), went kamikaze
Another 40
I'm Michael Jordan and bitch, I'm scoring
Drank two 40's
My bitch is foreign, she got deported
Thousand ounces, police is knocking
Ain't got no worries (ain't got no)
Feeling funky
I popped a molly, went kamikaze (kami)
Another 40
I'm Kyrie Irving and bitch, I'm scoring
Drank two 40's
My bitch is foreign, she got deported
Thousand ounces, this shit still popping
Ain't got no worries

[Post-Chorus]
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky (Stoney)

[Verse 1]
I popped a molly, switching lanes
I'ma pull up in this bitch, exotic (skrrt)
Lean in Sprite and gin in tonic
These bitches erotic
She just wanna get inside my motherfucking pocket (yeah)
Another 40, I should stop it (woah)
Two thousand ounces of this shit will make you feel like vomit
But I don't mind it, I kinda like it
Young and wild
We killing shit, we live this shit
I ain't go to school
They ask me how I live like this
I did my shit, 20 this year
And I'm only getting older 'til I'm in the dirt (I'm in the dirt)
How I hold a grudge with two 40's all in my hand (all in my hand)
But pull up on me, try me, you can catch the fade my man
You and your friends

[Chorus]
40 got me funky (funky)
I popped a molly (molly), went kamikaze
Another 40
I'm Michael Jordan and bitch, I'm scoring
Drank two 40's
My bitch is foreign, she got deported
Thousand ounces, police is knocking
Ain't got no worries (ain't got no)
Feeling funky
I popped a molly, went kamikaze (kami)
Another 40
I'm Kyrie Irving and bitch, I'm scoring
Drank two 40's
My bitch is foreign, she got deported
Thousand ounces, this shit still popping
Ain't got no worries

[Post-Chorus]
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky

[Verse 2]
Gimme the 40
So I can be cool, yeah
Pass me the molly, ayy
I wanna them too
No, I can't get enough
Man, I'm popping them shits and I'm dropping them hits
The music, the liquor thatâ€™s why I exist
And the money, but let's skip the obvious shit
Ain't living too long if I'm living like this
Early morning waking up with the sweats
Going through shit I ain't never forget
But nothing I do, will I ever regret
I need me that cheque, I need me that chronic
I don't remember, tell me what's my name?
Drinking, swerving in the other lane
Fucking zooted drinking acid rains
Spill it on Supreme

[Chorus]
40 got me funky (funky)
I popped a molly (molly), went kamikaze
Another 40
I'm Michael Jordan and bitch, I'm scoring
Drank two 40's
My bitch is foreign, she got deported
Thousand ounces, police is knocking
Ain't got no worries (ain't got no)
Feeling funky
I popped a molly, went kamikaze (kami)
Another 40
I'm Kyrie Irving and bitch, I'm scoring
Drank two 40's
My bitch is foreign, she got deported
Thousand ounces, this shit still popping
Ain't got no worries

[Post-Chorus]
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
