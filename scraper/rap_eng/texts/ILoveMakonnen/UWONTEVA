[Intro]
That's fine
Never, never stop my shine, uh
Some people don't fuck with you no more (who?)
That's fine, tell me the last time a hater, ever
Never, never stop my shine, uh
Heard you an them folks ain't cool (who?), that's true
Let a motherfucka' know one thing
You won't ever stop doin' what I do

[Chorus]
You won't ever stop doin' what I do (nah)
You won't ever stop doin' what I do (okay)
You won't ever stop doin' what I do (nah)
You won't ever stop doin' what I do (who?)
Let a motherfucka' know one thing (what?)
You won't ever stop doin' what I do (nah)
You won't ever stop doin' what I do (okay)

[Verse 1]
I hit the scene like the ketamine, young boy is back
Young thing's in the town, what you know about that?
Aw god damn, homie we be makin' them racks
I don't speak no false shit, all I talk is facts
Never seen you on the corner, nigga never been
On the boulevards or avenue, nigga not my friend
Heard you 'round the town dissing us, boy pull up
You know that you never see it, huh, your shit is tough

[Hook]
Some people don't fuck with you no more, huh?
That's fine, tell the last time a hater ever, ever
Never stop my shine, shit
Heard you an them folks ain't cool (who?), that's true
Let a motherfucka' know one thing (what?)

You won't ever stop doin' what I do (nah)
You won't ever stop doin' what I do (aye)
You won't ever stop doin' what I do (never)
Let a motherfucka' know one thing (who?)
You won't ever stop doin' what I do (never)
You won't ever stop doin' what I do (okay)
You won't ever stop doin' what I do (nah)
Let a motherfucka' know one thing (who?)

[Verse 2]
Runnin' lies 'round the town, talkin' 'bout how you made me
Came to Atlanta, talkin' 'bout how you made [?], huh
We don't know ya boy, if you do, you french fry
You can't pull up to the West
Or the East side
I be still on Moreland, out here swervin' on 'em
Pull up on little cause the app still servin' on 'em
Uh, what the fuck it do
Shoutsout to that Awful Crew
Shoutsout to myself tho, you know what the fuck I do
Ugh, all around, in them gawd damn cities
Mothafuckas' like me, made it out the Bity
Now I'm all in Manhattan, makin' shit happen
What happened?
To them others

[Hook]
Some people don't fuck with you no more
That's fine, when the last time a hater ever, ever
Never stop my shine, shit
Heard you an them folks ain't cool (hey, hey) , that's true
Let a motherfucka' know one thing (what?)

You won't ever stop doin' what I do (nah)
You won't ever stop doin' what I do (aye)
You won't ever stop doin' what I do (who?)
You won't ever stop doin' what I do (nah?)
You won't ever stop doin' what I do (okay?)
Let a motherfucka' know one thing (what?)
You won't ever stop doin' what I do (nah)

You won't ever stop doin' what I do (yaaah)
