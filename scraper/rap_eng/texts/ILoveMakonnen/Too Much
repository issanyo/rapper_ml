[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
You've been fronting on us hard too much
You always talking about these broads too much
You steady keep confusin' us too much
You always keep losing us too much
You've been fronting on us hard too much
You always talking about these broads too much
You steady keep confusin' us too much
You always keep losing us too much

[Verse 1: ILoveMakonnen]
I don't need your love haunting me
I have enough fucking demons stalking me
You say way too much when there's no need
Then say how I shouldn't speak
Promises you couldn't keep
Falling again on your knees
Screaming towards heaven's feet
Asking for another me

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
You've been fronting on us hard too much
You always talking about these broads too much
You steady keep confusin' us too much
You always keep losing us too much
You've been fronting on us hard too much
You always talking about these broads too much
You steady keep confusin' us too much
You always keep losing us too much

[Verse 2: ILoveMakonnen]
I'm still doing me from start to jump
It's like all they do is complain to us
Can you save my soul from this heat?
The cold takes a toll on my street
Living day and night to smoke my weed
People outside keep calling me
I'm not ready for love involving me
I've been ready for us to travel the sea

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
You've been fronting on us hard too much
You always talking about these broads too much
You steady keep confusin' us too much
You always keep losing us too much
You've been fronting on us hard too much
You always talking about these broads too much
You steady keep confusin' us too much
You always keep losing us too much
