Always you'll go down you'll go down down, o down
Always you'll fall down, yeah you always you'll fall down you go

I don't wanna talk no more
Cuz you've been acting real strange
I don't wanna speak no more
Cuz you've been messing
So down down, down down

Always you'll go down you'll go, always you'll fall down you go down down, o down
Always you'll fall down, yeah you always you'll fall down you go down down, down down
Always you'll fall down, yeah you always you'll fall down you go

I don't wanna see your face
It's bringing back all my bad times
I don't wanna hear your voice
Cuz you sound like, like some
So down down, down down

Ohhhh

Whatever Snuff shut the fuck up Daisy, whoever the fuck that is fucking sniffing the fucking back of my fucking song. Shit, so

Always you'll go down you'll go, always you'll fall down you go down down, o down
Always you'll fall down, yeah you always you'll fall down you go down down, down down
Always you'll fall down, yeah you always you'll fall down you go

Down down, down down
Always you'll fall down, yeah you always you'll fall down you go
