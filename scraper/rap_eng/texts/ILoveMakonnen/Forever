[Intro: FKi 1st]
Word, time, time
Word, time, time
Ohh, oh

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
You needed a love
That lasted forever
For how long, forever

I remember when you said
You needed a love
That lasted forever
For how long, forever
(How long, how long, how long, I told you that it's gon' last forever)
Yea, yea, you did, Yea, yea, I needed it (I needed it)
Yea, yea, you did, Yea, yea, I needed it

[Verse 1: FKi 1st]
She said it's, over, over, over, and over again
But I just played dumb retarded, act like it's pretend
Then she got the nerve to get bullshit from a friend
I was stuck here with a fucked up Benz

I remember when you told me that you loved me and gon' never let me go, yea
And you meant that from the bottom of your heart, deep down in your soul, yea
And you made me feel good, good from my highs and to my lows
I ain't say you was a hoe, but girl you need to learn your role
First we started fuckin' it was cool
And everything we like to do just wasn't new
What's the point of playing games if we gon' lose
Sorry baby, it's just what I do

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
You needed a love
That lasted forever
For how long, forever

I remember when you said
You needed a love
That lasted forever
For how long, forever
(How long, how long, how long, I told you that it's gon' last forever)
Yea, yea, you did, Yea, yea, I needed it (I needed it)
Yea, yea, you did, Yea, yea, I needed it

[Verse 2: ILoveMakonnen]
I won't be sneaky if you treat me like the last time
Your heart is cracked because you said I was the last guy
That you would ever let get inside
I'm tryna find out how you feel inside
Your heart is bleeding, when you, when you need it
And now you left me and I'm feeling so defeated
'Cause I thought that we would always be
But something's changed now between you and me
And I don't understand
Not again, 'gain, I can be your man, but I remember when-

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
You needed a love
That lasted forever
For how long, forever

I remember when you said
You needed a love
That lasted forever
For how long, forever
(How long, how long, how long, I told you that it's gon' last forever)
Yea, yea, you did, Yea, yea, I needed it (I needed it)
Yea, yea, you did, Yea, yea, I needed it (Woah, woah)

[Verse 3: ILoveMakonnen]
I'll take you back if you do me like the last time
Your heart is cracked, 'cause you said I was the last guy
That you would ever let get that close
We're having drinks and now we'll toast
To the future and our past
I'm so glad for the times we had
And I just wanna, make more
I love you girl and I let you know

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
I remember when you said
You needed a love
That lasted forever
For how long, forever

I remember when you said
You needed a love
That lasted forever
For how long, forever
(How long, how long, how long, I told you that it's gon' last forever)
Yea, yea, you did, Yea, yea, I needed it
Yea, yea, you did, Yea, yea, I needed it
