I think my life is a joke
I might be on too many drugs
I lost so many friends, I don't know who to hug, I wonder why, I, I, try
I swear my friends are on dope
All them looking for drugs
All they really wanna do is get high
I wonder why, do I try?
Yeah I think my life is a joke, sometimes
I think my life is a joke, sometimes

The crew was playin on me
Since I was so young
I used to want to run away to somewhere fun, well I could hide
I need you inside
I remember bein alone, all those nights
I used to want to run away, to somewhere bright and smile and feel alright, yeah
I've been through so much pain it helped me gain a lot I wonder if I joined a Sunday fifty rainin a lot, I cry, yeah thinkin bout my past times

So many I wanted to be right here with me, they had to leave, unexpectedly and I'm tryin, to be there for them I feel like I'm so young and I don't know a lot but at the same time I feel like I've been growin a lot Sometimes, I wonder who I am, ah
I thank the Lord for the life that I live I mean, whatever this is, I'll be thankin him and I'll ride oh, all the time
Yeah, I can't believe it would, what we had is lost, and sometimes I be goin back, tryin to find, find, I ain't doin so fine
Like watch you run away if you said you loved me, I gave you all of my heart, for what, or that time, damn, you hurt me so bad
I don't even know why I try to sing these songs, I swear she'll never hear em, you never care what I was, on, nah, you cared at all, oh

I think my life is a joke and sometimes I think I do too many drugs well sometimes
I think my life is a joke, sometimes, I think I do too many drugs, but sometimes I feel fine yeah
It help me feel fine, cause I think my life is a joke sometimes
From all the cruel jokes that was played on me, I didn't hurt no one
Tried to love everybody, yeah, why'd they do me so wrong?
Yeah and now I don't mind, spending all my time, at my house, bein alone, oh, not tryin to find

No one to share my thoughts, or love with
I feel I should be, alone with myself, yeah
You face this all, all
I got so many dark demons hidin inside of me, I swear I look into the mirror, I start feelin ugly, sometimes, oh I wonder why
Oh, I think my life is a joke sometimes
I think my life is a joke, sometimes
