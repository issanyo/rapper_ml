[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Started off playing, lies you were saying
Started off laughing, then I start to believe
Said you were stayin' but you were lying
You're thinking bout leaving, walking out on me
Like all I've done, it wasn't for fun
Now you not here, my heart still bleeds
You be actin' so brand new
Seeing someone else and it just ain't you

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
Why'd you call? If you got other numbers to dial
Why'd you call? If you've been seeing someone else
Why'd you call just to play with my heart?
Why'd you call Just to play with my heart?

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Started off at backstage, ended up at the hotel
Started off fucking now like oh well
You said that's my pussy, said that's your dick
You've been thinking 'bout cheating, creeping on me
Like all I've done, it wasn't for fun
Now you not here, my heart still bleeds
Now you actin' so brand new
Seeing someone else and it just ain't you
Can you tell me why?

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
Why'd you call? If you got other numbers to dial
Why'd you call? If you've been seeing someone else
Why'd you call just to play with my heart?
Why'd you call Just to play with my heart?
Why'd you call? If you got other numbers to dial
Why'd you call? If you've been seeing someone else
Why'd you call just to play with my heart?
Why'd you call Just to play with my heart?
Why'd you call just to play with my heart?
Why'd you call Just to play with my heart?
Why'd you call?
Why'd you call?
Why'd you call?
