[Intro]
Yeah, huagh, huagh
All damn night, I been huagh
Fuck round with that white like huagh!

[Verse 1]
All up on the corner and my shit be goddamn booming boy
Back in New York I feel like Patrick Ewing boy
All the way from the 80s, my shit is still gravy
Shout out to your lady, yeah, yeah, she became my lady
Hit 'em with the droptop when I hit that highway boy
Niggas they don't know my shit costs like 5 ways boy
I got a hoe outside, she gon' pull up right now
And she gonna make it all go down
All my shit be the mothafuckin best, nigga
If you ain't know it's coming from the west
We gonna kick this shit off in the south
I'ma turn it up and I'ma turn it out

[Hook]
Where your girl at?
Watch me turn it out like huagh, ay all in her mouth
Where your girl at?
Watch me turn it out like huagh, ay all in her mouth
All up in her mouth, in her mouth, like huagh
All up in her mouth, in her mouth, huagh
All up in her mouth, in her mouth, like huagh

[Verse 2]
Hey boy, what the fuck it do?
I spit at least 37 for that blue
Pills, all on Xanax
Give a damn about who got next
All damn night I be fuckin' with that white
Tony on my Delta flight
Flight attendants know me my last name
Fuck around and meet a bitch in baggage claim

[Hook]
Where your girl at?
Watch me turn it out like huagh, ay all in her mouth
Where your girl at?
Watch me turn it out like huagh, ay all in her mouth
All off in her mouth, all off in her mouth, huagh
All off in her mouth, all off in her mouth, huagh
Where your bitch, watch me turn her out
Where your bitch, watch me turn her out
