[Chorus]
That potion got me leanin'
That potion got me leanin'
Side to side
That potion got me leanin'

[Verse 1]
Had to pour 2 fourths  in my little double cup
Had to put some gas in my little purple truck
I've been ridin' all night on 85 south
Tryna make these plays before I leave the south
Cause I'm always flyin' back out fuckin' west
I got so much gas man this shit burn my chest
Now my friends is pourin' up and we on the top floor
Man this shit is so purple I can't even look no more cause I'm

[Chorus]
Side to side
That potion got me leanin'
Side to side
Potion got me leanin'
Side to side
That potion got me leanin'
Side to side

[Verse 2]
I've been drippin' I've been dippin' I've been fuckin' sellin' dope
I've been out here with my white friends they been movin' all this coke
We've been on them fuckin' boats
I've been playin' on this ship
I've been feelin' like a baller need the ring championship
I've been goin' I've been snowin'
I've been hangin' in the rain
I've been laughin' I've been cryin'
Feelin all this joy and pain
All my friends done fuckin' left me but i do not give a fuck
Because I'm makin' so much money i could buy them nigga's luck

[Chorus]
Side to side
That potion got me leanin'
Side to side
That potion got you leanin'
Side to side
That potion got me leanin'
Side to side
That potion got you leanin'
Side to side

[Outro]
That potion got you leanin'
Side to side, side to side
Side to side
That potion got you leanin'
Side to side
