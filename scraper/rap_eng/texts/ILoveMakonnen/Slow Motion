I will always feel and I will always care
I wish she was my enemy but I'm still waiting here
For her to hold my hand, for her to steal my breath
For her to pick up the pieces of promises never kept

She moves in slow motion, sonically as the rain
As the rain falls down
Everything is still as she moves to me
Stands still, stands still, stands still

Maybe I'll do better on my own
Why does everything disappear?
When all I see is you alone
And her love moves slowly

It's time now
I'm dying for you to call my name
(I'm dying)
I'm waiting, still fading
(Still fading)
So tell me I am not alone

I will always feel and I will always care
I wish she was my enemy but I'm still waiting here
For her to hold my hand, for her to steal my breath
For her to pick up the pieces of promises never kept

She moves in slow motion, sonically as the rain
As the rain falls down
Everything is still as she moves to me
Stands still, stands still, stands still

Maybe I'll do better on my own
Why does everything disappear?
When all I see is you alone
And her love moves slowly

It's time now
I'm dying for you to call my name
(I'm dying)
I'm waiting, still fading
(Still fading)
So tell me I am not alone

I'm still waiting, I'm still fading
Wake me from this sleep
So I can begin living
Or give me the solution
So I can start dying
Will I start living or start dying?

Maybe I'll do better on my own
Why does everything disappear?
When all I see is you alone
And her love moves slowly

It's time now
I'm dying for you to call my name
(I'm dying)
I'm waiting, still fading
(Still fading)
So tell me I am not alone

I'm waiting for you to call my name
I'm waiting so tell me I am not alone
