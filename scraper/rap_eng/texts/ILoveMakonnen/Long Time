[Intro]
Long time, long time
To get over you
To find a love that's true

[Verse 1]
So many nights, I cried
So many days, I prayed
Many times, I lied
Just to make you stay

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn’t think I could make it without your love
I didn't think I could make it without your touch
I had to leave all the pain you caused my heart
Because I deserved a real love

[Chorus]
It took a very long time, long time
To get over you
Long time, long time
To find a love that's true
Long time, long time
To get over you
Long time, long time
To find a love that’s true

[Verse 2]
So many nights, I cried
So many days, I prayed
Many times, I lied
Just to make you stay

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't think I could make it without your love
I didn't think I could make it without your touch
I had to leave all the pain you caused my heart
Because I deserved a real love

[Chorus]
It took a very long time, long time
To get over you
Long time, long time
To find a love that's true
Long time, long time
To get over you
Long time, long time
To find a love that's true

It took a very long time, long time
To get over you
Long time, long time
To find a love that's true
Long time, long time
To get over you
Long time, long time
To find a love that's true

It took a very long time, long time
To get over you
Long time, long time
To find a love that's true
Long time, long time
To get over you
Long time, long time
To find a love that’s true

[Outro]
To get over you, to get over you
To find a love that’s true
Long time
To find a love that's true
