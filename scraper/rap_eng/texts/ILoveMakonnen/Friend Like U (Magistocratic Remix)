[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
I never had a friend like you
I don't think I'll ever find another
All the bad things that we been through
It's so good we got each other
I know sometimes it's hard to find something to believe in
And nothing ever seems to last for more than just a season
But brotherhood and unity will never lose their style
I wanna let you know how much your friendship drives me wild

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
Yo, MC Kaz
Bringing the spells from the past
A friend like you is really hard to come by
Neo Yokio is sad and lonely
Sitting, counting money in my penthouse
I just wish I had a magic homie
Arcangelo, you're kinda like my nemesis
We been head to head since the genesis
I just really hope that you remember this
I'm only rapping for you 'cause it's Christmas
I be in Neo Yokio scheming
'Cause I'm always chasing after demons
You think you flyer than me then you dreaming
You'll be my arch nemesis until I stop breathing, look

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
Yo, MC Kaz
Look, a friend like you is really hard to come by, yeah
Neo Yokio is sad and lonely, yeah
Swimming in the sea beneath 14th Street, yeah
I just really wish I had a magic homie, damn
Arcangelo playing my Nintendo, damn
Arcangelo in it out the window, yeah
Arcangelo hit the center band, oh wait
Arcangelo I turned on the piano, let's go!
Lexy and Gottlieb be like chill b
But I got Christmas trees trying to kill me
The greatest demon slayer I will be
I'm throwing cash riding on the Mecha, you feel me

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
I never had a friend like you
I don't think I'll ever find another
All the bad things that we been through
It's so good we got each other
I know sometimes it's hard to find something to believe in
And nothing ever seems to last for more than just a season
But brotherhood and unity will never lose their style
I wanna let you know how much your friendship drives me wild
