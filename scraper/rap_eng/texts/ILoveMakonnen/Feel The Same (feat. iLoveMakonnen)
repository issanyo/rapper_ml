[Verse 1]
It's been four months since I learned your name
Ten weeks since we had a date
Our time seems like it's well spent
But now i'm just helping
I'm trying to get to know if you feel the same
The way I do when I say I love your name
But maybe not, and i'll never know
I had my feelings I never tried to show

[Hook]
I won't tell you how I feel
I'm afraid you don't feel the same
I won't tell you how I feel
Cause i'm afraid you won't feel the same
And it's killing me sometimes
And its been killing me inside
But I don't tell you how I feel
Cause i'm afraid you don't feel the same
I won't tell you how I feel
Cause i'm afraid you won't feel the same
And it's been killing me sometimes
And it's been killing me inside

[Verse 2]
It's been four weeks since I held your hands
Three days till I see you again
And I wonder if you'll be
Just as happy as me
Cause I've been tripping inside
Really thinking about my life
If you could be the one I spend it all with
I don't mind

[Hook]
But I don't tell you how I feel
I'm afraid you don't feel the same
I won't tell you how I feel
Cause i'm afraid you won't feel the same
And it'sbeen killing me sometimes
And its been killing me inside
I don't tell you how I feel
Cause i'm afraid you don't feel the same
I won't tell you how I feel
I'm afraid you won't feel the same
And it's been killing me sometimes
And it's been killing me inside
