[Verse 1]
Now I been loving you and loving you for so long
And you still do me wrong
Baby I don't understand
Tell me what do you have planned?
Cause I been thinking 'bout us all the time
And what can I do to bring more smiles here for you
Girl you see I'm choosing you

[Chorus 1]
Won't you turn off the lights, turn off the lights?
Cause baby I don't want to see all the lies you hide from me
Won't you turn off the lights?
Just turn off the lights
Cause baby I don't want to see all the lies you hide from me

[Verse 2]
Now you been loving me and loving me and loving wrong
And that I know, I been trying to take it slow
My friends think that I should go, aye
But I'm like nah, nah, girl, you're the one
I'mma stand right here, until we try to make it right
We fuss and fight every other night

[Chorus 2]
Won't you turn off the lights?
Won't you turn off the lights?
Cause baby I don't want to see all the lies you hide from me
Won't you turn off the lights?
Won't you turn off the lights?
Cause baby I don't want to see all the lies you hide from me

[Outro]
Won't you turn off the lights?
Turn off the lights
Cause baby I don't want to see all the lies you hide from me
Baby I don't want to see all the lies you hide from me
Baby I don't want to see all the lies you hide from me
