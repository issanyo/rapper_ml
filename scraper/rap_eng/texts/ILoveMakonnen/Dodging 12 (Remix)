[Intro: ILoveMakonnen]
I got gas on deck and you know that fool
I get everybody high in your middle school

[Verse 1: ILoveMakonnen]
I'm riding 'round the city with the packs fucking swervin'
Riding down 75 north just servin'
Gas with the purp, I don't sell no fuckin' molly ho
I can find the shrooms and it's probably for the high though
Ayy on that hydro, nigga Mr. Nice Guy
I be smokin' all type of weed they be flyin' in
On Air Tran or whatever fuckin' airline
Then my friend gonna bring that shit right here tonight

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
Out here in the streets tryna make some more dough
If I ain't in the streets, then I'm in the studio
So I'm out here in the streets tryna make some more dough
If I ain't in the streets, then I'm in the studio
And when I'm in the streets, you know I'm dodgin' 12
Because me and my friends don't go to jail
When I'm in the streets, you know I'm dodgin' 12
Because me and my friends don't go to jail
Me and my friends don't go to jail
Me and my friends don't go to jail
Me and my friends don't go to jail

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
In the kitchen, grab the fork, water work, I'm whippin' that
Trap house, lotta weight, people say I'm gettin' fat
Lean with the Sprite, purple shit, I be mixin' that
I ain't with the chitter-chat, 10 bands'll get your ass
Stomped with my Timberlands, I shoot him with my FN
Know that I got good aim, might shoot him with my left hand
Find out his beef then I'm pullin' up in a huntin' van
Bitches sayin' I'm the man, walk around with a 100 bands

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
Out here in the streets tryna make some more dough
If I ain't in the streets, then I'm in the studio
So I'm out here in the streets tryna make some more dough
If I ain't in the streets, then I'm in the studio
And when I'm in the streets, you know I'm dodgin' 12
Because me and my friends don't go to jail
When I'm in the streets, you know I'm dodgin' 12
Because me and my friends don't go to jail
Me and my friends don't go to jail
Me and my friends don't go to jail
Me and my friends don't go to jail

[Verse 3: Yung Gleesh]
4nem caught the charge, and shawty jumped the fence
They left the dog up in the yard, Monroe out here goin' hard
We out here sellin' more goop than them niggas out in Bentley Park
Or Langley Park or Barry Farm you work which one you are
[?] money can't pay for bond
And old beef still old beef, nigga I ain't say they were gone
And old beef turn to new beef, boy I park right there on Newton
Turn my mixtape up to 23 and you turned into a groupie
I pull up in my Chrystler and they chest bump with my Uzi
The police try to get checked well I hit them with the oowee
I turn down on Lil 20th street and hit that left on South Dakota
And pust their ass up in the alley, I think I'm 'bout to lose 'em

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
Out here in the streets tryna make some more dough
If I ain't in the streets, then I'm in the studio
So I'm out here in the streets tryna make some more dough
If I ain't in the streets, then I'm in the studio
And when I'm in the streets, you know I'm dodgin' 12
Because me and my friends don't go to jail
When I'm in the streets, you know I'm dodgin' 12
Because me and my friends don't go to jail
Me and my friends don't go to jail
Me and my friends don't go to jail
Me and my friends don't go to jail
