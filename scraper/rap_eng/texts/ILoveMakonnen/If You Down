[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
Baby if you're down to keep it real with me
I'll be down to keep it real with you
And baby if you're down to chill with me
I'll be down to chill with you
Baby if you're down to keep it real with me
I'll be down to keep it real with you
And baby if you're down to chill with me
I'll be down to chill with you

[Verse 1: ILoveMakonnen]
Girl just let me know
Tell me what's on your mind
When you get off from work
I know you working hard
I just wanna take some time
And not be a jerk
Are you with your girls?
I wish that we could just stop it
You know you my pocket rocket
Baby turn me on
Oh girl you get me so hot
That's why I really wanna be your guy

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
So baby if you're down to keep it real with me
I'll be down to keep it real with you
And baby if you're down to chill with me
I'll be down to chill with you
So baby if you're down to keep it real with me
I'll be down to keep it real with you
And baby if you're down to chill with me
I'll be down to chill with you

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Like baby are you down, down, down?
Show you round the town, town, town
In your nightgown, gown, gown
You're my queen, you deserve a crown
It's Lil Boat and Makonnen
She gon' fuck me cause Iâ€™m zonin'
I remember all them nights up on Moreland
When would ride all night 'til the morning, in my Beemer
We started to roam, roam, roam
We started to roam, roam, roam
We would drive like vroom, vroom, vroom
We would skrt like vroom, vroom, vroom
I can't wait 'til I get you in my bedroom

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
Baby if you're down to keep it real with me
I'll be down to keep it real with you
And baby if you're down to chill with me
I'll be down to chill with you
Baby if you're down to keep it real with me
I'll be down to keep it real with you
And baby if you're down to chill with me
I'll be down to chill with you
