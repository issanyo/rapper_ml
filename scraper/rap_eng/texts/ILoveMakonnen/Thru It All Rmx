[Intro: Wintertime]
I been going through it
I been going through it all

[Hook: Wintertime]
I been going through it all
Back all against the wall
Trying hard not to fall
All I wanted was to ball
I been going through it all
Back all against the wall
I only get one call
Who the fuck do I call?

[Verse 1: Wintertime]
I ain't got no friends, all I got is my fam
Lafontaine shit, me and Sloan 'til the end
Fuck all these other niggas, I don't wanna do a song with ya
Unless you talking about some guala
In that case I might hit ya
I think I been too nice, but this is where the shit ends
Pussy boy I ain't your nigga, and bitch I ain't your fucking man
I dont fuck with nobody, I never fuck with nobody
You can ask anybody, if they said I did then they lying
Dont talk about me like you know me
I see that all these niggas phony
And all these hoes need to keep the mamba out they mouth
Unless they finna blow me
All of this could've been avoided
But a nigga really had to snap
Cause I been going through it all
And ain't nobody have my back

[Verse 2: ILoveMakonnen]
I been going through it all alone
And ain't nobody have my back
I been going through it all, wintertime and fall
I been out here playing by myself, I still ball
Bitches done turn bald, they ain't got no weave
They said I'm Lucifer cause all I do is deceive
But that's just a lie, I'm always in the sky
Red dragon look like a red ruby when I fly by
God damn is he high? No boy, I'm sober
I been out here doing this music since October
But niggas out here hating, and I don't give no love
But I been out here making hits like I'm off the truck
I'm all about these books, we all about this cash
Wintertime, boy them kids is a dash

[Verse 3: Wintertime]
Soon as shit take off, new ice, new car
I'ma flex so hard, I'm really tryna hurt your heart
Bitch what the fuck you thought
What you thought that I forgot?
Just cause I be off the drugs, don't think a nigga went dumb
I been going through it all, that's why I'm going so hard
You did this shit to yourselves, I swear it's not my fault
I know I'm really about to blow, and I ain't never been wrong
Young mamba finna glow, I gotta prove these bitches wrong
I don't do this shit for fun, bitch I'm really tryna stunt
So I can pull up on my ex, and make the ho feel dumb
I'm already getting paid, just off the features and the hooks
But a nigga never satisfied, even if that's how I look
I always been a greedy bitch, always been a pretty bitch
And I don't care how sad I get, I always be with the shits
And let me find out you a lick
Still run up in your crib
Still out here taking risks
Do whatever for the chips

[Hook: Wintertime]
I been going through it all
Back all against the wall
Trying hard not to fall
All I wanted was to ball
I been going through it all
Back all against the wall
I only get one call
Who the fuck do I call?

[Outro: Wintertime]
I been going through it all
I been going through it all
I been going through it all
I only get one call, I only get one call
So who the fuck do I call?
