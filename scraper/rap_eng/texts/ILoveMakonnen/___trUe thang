[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
Like what we got
Is the true thing
You was all that i needed
So i’m down
I ride
I do for us
I’m here
I stay
Whatever you need
Cause what we’ve got
Is the true thang
Like what we got
Is the true thing
You was all i needed

[Verse 1: Rome Fortune]
Okay, it’s more than your ass
More than your tits
More than you eyes
More so your lip
This is what we doing
Baby give a kiss
I say
If it’s really real baby give me kiss
If it’s really real baby give me kiss
If it’s really real baby give me kiss
If it’s really real baby give me kiss

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
Like what we got
Is the true thing
You was all that i needed

I’m here
I stay
Whatever you need
Cause what we’ve got
Is the true thang
Like what we got
Is the true thing
You was all i needed

[Verse 2: Rome Fortune]
Look, it’s more than your drive
More than your whips
Reach for the sky
Might grant your wish
If that’s what we’re doing baby give a kiss
If it’s really real baby give a kiss
If it’s really real baby give a kiss
If it’s really real baby give a kiss
