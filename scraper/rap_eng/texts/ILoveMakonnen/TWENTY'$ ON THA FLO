[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen]
I'm out here flexing on them big
Throwing twentys on the floor
Throwing twentys on the floor
I'm out here flexing on them big
Throwing hundreds on your ho
Throwing hundreds on your ho
I'm throwing twentys, ay, ay, ay
On the floor, ay, ay, ay
I'm throwing hundreds, ay, ay, ay
On your ho, ay, ay, ay
I'm throwing twentys, ay, ay, ay
On the floor, ay, ay, ay
I'm throwing hundreds, ay, ay, ay
On your ho, ay, ay, ay

[Verse 1: Key!]
Baby you were worth way more than a dollar
