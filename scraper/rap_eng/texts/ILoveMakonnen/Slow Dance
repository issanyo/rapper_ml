[Verse 1]
I know that we're young
But you could grow old
Somebody else, who has a real fortune, but I’m going give my all
Some say it's dumb, when I fall in love
Me and Lil Peep running like four horsemen
And I won't cry at all
So baby can I slow dance, with you?
Baby, there is no chance, it’s true
I'm with the love of my life, I wanna treat you right
Every single night, every single night
Slow dance with you
Baby, there is no chance, it's true
I'm with the love of my life, I wanna treat you right
Every single night, every single night

[Verse 2]
Slow dance, with you
Hold things, it's true
Everything you need, I'll be, everything you want, i'll see
There's no time, you’ll need no other guy, but me only
I just wanna slow dance, with you
’Cause baby there is no chance, it's true
I’m with the love of my life, I wanna treat you right
Every single night, every single night
Slow dance with you
'Cause baby there is no chance, it's true
I'm with the love of my life
I wanna treat you right
Every single night, every single night
