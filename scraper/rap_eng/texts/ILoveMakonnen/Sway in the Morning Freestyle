Just got back in the U.S
Goddamn it, I'm feeling kinda stress
At the same time, feeling so blessed
At the same time, this shit is a mess
Shouts out to my new girl in Oklahoma
I'mma see you and call you when I get home-a
FInna leave here around noon
You know I'm always on the motherfuckin' moon
Stay high, stay fly, I'm the red dragon
All the friends like, damn boy what happened?
Plug call like, boy you doing great
Losing that weight, you should come back to my state
Come trapping, I'm like "Boy, I'm rapping"
Shouts out to Warner Brothers, we gon' make it happen
Yeah, you know the kid be snapping
Hit me on my SnapChat
I'm probably riding around in the Uber
Something you used to
Black car, VIP, you know I'm used to
In the first class, with my backpack
ILoveMakonnen, keep the best snacks
Super Chef got edibles coming soon
Shouts out to everybody in the damn
Aye, we do it live every day
Out here in the morning and I'm chillin' with Sway
