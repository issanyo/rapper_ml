[Verse 1]
Cruising (mhm), in the woods
You don't care if you're alone
You've been on that train
You've been grinding on your own
You don't give a damn
So you'll be out here being bad
You don't wanna' talk
So you're out here disrespecting your dad
Your (ugh-ah) grandma don't even answering your calls
You been acting bad
You don't even bother to change your draws
All your friends don't like what I do
But all your friends sell cocaine too
Why you trying to act like that?
When all your friends

[Chorus]
Then slow it down
Down for you
I slowed it down
Down for you
I slowed it down
Down for you
I slowed it down
Down for you
I slowed it down
Down for you
I slowed it down
Down for you

[Verse 2]
Like remember, when the time
You didn't have a goddamn dime
I  was standing by your side
Telling you you're gon' be alright
Now all your friends don't like what I do
But all your friends sell cocaine too
Why you trying to act like that?
When all your friends

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Cuz I remember (ugh) when you didn't have, a goddamn dime
I was (ugh) standing here, right by your side
Telling you gon' be alright
On them cold nights, I was telling you gon' be alright
When you didn't have no ride
I would even make that walk
Probably have a little small talk
Just to take your mind off
All the things that pissed you off
Like all your friends don't like what I do
But all your friends sell cocaine too
So why are you trying to act like that
When all your friends

[Chorus]x2

[Outro]
I don't care who you heard
Cuz so many done heard 'bout you
But, I slowed it down
Down for you
I slowed it down
Down for you
I slowed it down
Down for you
I'll be standing
Standing right beside
