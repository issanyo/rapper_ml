[Intro: Yeah x34]

[Verse 1: Father]
I got caller ID
And I don't pick up if it ain't the guala callin' me
Flip phone Nokia
Red bone Lolita
Hands in her panties watchin' flicks on Toshiba
Other hand on my jammy case these niggas want my reup

[Bridge: Rich Po Slim]
These niggas talkin' bout they got four cell phones and they juggin' and bumpin', boy I know you on ya mama at&t cell phone plan, boy I see ya with ya iPhone 5
Hustlin' off that you tryna do fed time I'm talkin' bout iCloud, GPS and all that, boy I pay my cell phone bill with a green dot card
Fuck you talkin bout

[Chorus]
Flip phone Nokia, flip phone Nokia
Flip phone Nokia, flip phone Nokia
Flip phone Nokia, flip phone Nokia

[Verse 2: ILoveMakonnen]
Your favorite producer on my line tryna say I'm next
But I'm on the man right now on my Moto X
Emails all day, junk mail full of money
Servin' digital dope, just like my bro Sonny
Got damn I'm metro boomin' cause I'm really on the southside
Makin' plays at waffle house, Bojangles, Church's, Popeyes
This shit smokin', have you chokin', fuck around your back gone hurt
If you want a pack like that then call my fuckin' cell phone, jerk

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ya, ya, ya, shawty damn shawty damn shawty damn, when you gone come 'round without your man
(When you coming through) x4
