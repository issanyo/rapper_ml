[Intro: ILoveMakonnen]
Like if I had to leave ya girl, then I would
But I won’t
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
So many people scouting me
I remember when they doubted me
Now ladies want to shout for me
But I remember when they doubted me
So many want to scout for me
But I remember when they doubted me
Now ladies want to shout for me
But I remember when they doubted

[Verse 1: ILoveMakonnen]
I had to do it
On my own, all alone
I’m taking risks, risks
All the time, was on my mind
I got to live for me
I’m taking care more than my family
So many places that I’d rather be
So many faces that I’d rather see
People gonna come for me
Want to lock me in the slums and be
On the low for life
I don’t know if I’m gon do it right

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
So many people scouting me
But I remember when they doubted me
Now ladies want to shout for me
But I remember when they doubted me
So many want to scout for me
But I remember when they doubted me
Now ladies want to shout for me
But I remember when they doubted

[Verse 2: ILoveMakonnen]
I had to keep it, on my own
In my mind, keep it growing
I remember when everybody used to say
That your shit would never get played
Now it’s like hold up
You need to pull up
Cause that shit you giving is some hot stuff
They really want that, fly me out to Belgium
I need some new stacks, they like we got em
So hold up, like where your cash at
You smoking weed now, but where the hash at
Like where the dope at, least we can do it fast
You want to do some new new, then where some coke at
My friend, my friend don’t even know it
And I don’t even try to show it
I let em find out on their own
'Cause I remember when I was home

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
And now they wanna scout for me
But I remember when they doubted me
So many want to shout for me
But I remember when they doubted me
So many want to scout for me
But I remember when they doubted me
Now ladies want to shout for me
But I remember when they doubted

[Verse 3: Key!]
My mama dead, I’m so out of pocket
My daddy never came out of pocket
He said go get it and I got it
I'ma go get her and I got it
Your main bitch, she keep calling
But I just want my motherfucking ex
Your main bitch, she gon' keep calling
And I'ma let her hit the hotel, yes
I know I’m stuttering, I stutter when I’m talking
I said these drugs they, they help me run away
I said your girl hey, she suck me till I'm okay
I said your world ayy, motherfuck them haters
Okay it’s Fat Man Key!, I’m coming down your block humble
Fat Man Key!, I’m coming down with your mama
Fat Man Key!, you’re so goddamn funny
Nigga I ain’t smiling this is how it go, hey

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
And now they wanna scout for me
But I remember when they doubted me
So many want to shout for me
But I remember when they doubted me
So many want to scout for me
But I remember when they doubted me
Now ladies want to shout for me
But I remember when they doubted
