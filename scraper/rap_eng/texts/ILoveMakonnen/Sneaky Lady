[Intro/Chorus]
Now she's a real sneaky lady, she'll be stealing your heart
Oh it's not your fault, she's been lying from the start

[Verse 1]
And so I met her downtown at na-niety-three
I think I looked kinda young, when I look at me
She got me feeling kinda old and oh oh so cold
I wanna be back wit her but oh oh oh no
She's been dancing outside
And she been doing real good
She got herself a new ride
And she done moved out the hood

[Chorus 1]
Well she's a real sneaky lady, and she'll be stealing your heart
Oh it's not your fault, she's been lying from the start
She's a real sneaky lady, and she'll be stealing your love
Oh it's not your fault, she's been lying from the start

[Verse 2]
And so you met her outside
And now you thinkin' that you
You could be with her
Well I wish you could
Because she turns into fire when you're in the room
She's been doing great things that you don't mention
To your friends or your mind or or or you mom
[?]
And you've been wearing your tie and shaking that work
And you've been showing her the moves cuz you know the work
You don't know what you're worth and know how she does
She been all through your money, she run through your club

[Chorus 2]
Cuz she's a real sneaky lady, and she'll be stealing your heart
Oh it's not your fault, she's been lying from the start
Now she's a real sneaky lady, and she'll be stealing your love
Oh it's not your fault, she's been lying from the start

[Bridge]
Pretty brown eyes turn blue
Brown hair, it turns red
And oh how I sing these songs
I wanna see out here

But she comin', she comin' tonight
She coming here
Cuz she's somehwere far, causing tears

[Chorus 3]
Cuz she's a real sneaky lady, and she'll be breaking their hearts
Oh it's not their fault, she's been lying from the start
I guess it's all my fault, they say I broke her heart
And now she's going wild, trying to get it back
