[Verse 1: iLoveMakonnen]
It could be so easy, girl
But if you cheat on him, I know that you'll leave me, girl
I don't understand who you tryna be with, girl
But all these other guys really tryna beat me, girl
Wish I had more time to spend
But I could never be your boyfriend
And I know that you hate that, but you always text back
Late night, sex times, morning lover
I call you when I have no other
You can make me feel right when I don't know what to feel like
I still think about us when I hear this song like
Hot kiss, cold hugs, leave each other
Drunk texts, Snapchats, online lover
Let me know when I can meet ya
So I can show a girl I don't need her

[Chorus: Huntar]
When it's 4AM in the morning
I've been thinking about my past again and
You should know, I don't want your love
Never have, never will
When it's 4AM and I call you
You can tell that I've been drinking when I say
You should come, take it off, all off
Help me get over her
You should know, I don't want, your love
Never have, never will

[Verse 2: Huntar]
How can I hold you so close
When I'm thinking of somebody else?
How can I treat you so right
When I know that you're only the help?
The reason you're here is to deal with my fear
I hate being alone
How can I do this to you
Yet you still always answer the phone?

[Chorus: Huntar]
When it's 4AM in the morning
I've been thinking about my past again and
You should know, I don't want your love
Never have, never will
When it's 4AM and I call you
You can tell that I've been drinking when I say
You should come, take it off, all off
Help me get over her
You should know, I don't want, your love
Never have, never will

[Verse 3: iLoveMakonnen]
I was out here on the block, moving out to Fresno
Looking for a new chick, someone too original
'Round with my new town, as I ride in Benz, though
I remember nights when we [?]
We was flying out somewhere on a private jet
She ain't have no time 'cause I ain't got it yet
So I ain't rocking no Roley neither
And I can tell a girl that I don't need her

[Chorus: Huntar]
When it's 4AM in the morning
I've been thinking about my past again and
You should know, I don't want your love
Never have, never will
When it's 4AM and I call you
You can tell that I've been drinking when I say
You should come, take it off, all off
Help me get over her
You should know, I don't want, your love
Never have, never will
