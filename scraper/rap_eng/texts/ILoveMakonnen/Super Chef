[Verse 1]
I don’t need no work ‘less I’m riding down the highway
I swear to god I’ma make it all by Friday
Bring it back, bring it back, take your pack back
My plug be calling, asking when I’m coming back
I’m like hold up bro, I got to do these fucking shows
He like hold up bro, what the fuck you rapping for
I said shit, I could make more than that brick
All in 30 minutes, man I swear this shit the shit
He like goddamn, well do that, and once you get that thing
Won’t you come bring it back
Cause this time, this time we gone triple that
Cause that work that I got is the best, boy it’s coming from the west

[Chorus]
Now go ahead, chef
And super, chef
Now go ahead, chef
And super, chef
Now go ahead, chef
And super, chef
Now go ahead, chef
And super, chef

[Verse 2]
In the kitchen, young cooking on lasagna
Ferrari burning all on the highway
You be smoking drinking on that crazy shit
Your friends acting so damn wild in this bitch
They be lit, they be lit, I be all in every city
Spend at least about 50 on that 420
Goddamnit homie, when the fuck you coming back in town
Cause this white over here, this shit be looking brown
Damn, well I can’t help you with that
I’m just finally doing more, I’ma pull up with that plaque
My friend don’t be bleaching none of that
That thing looking like a Cadillac

[Chorus]
Now go ahead, chef
And super, chef
Now go ahead, chef
And super, chef
Now go ahead, chef
And super, chef
Now go ahead, chef
And super, chef

[Verse 3]
Why you whip it how you whip it, huh?
Cause we needed more than we fucking getting huh
I swear I just want to be with no ceilings huh
I swear I just need at least 4 billion huh
Yeah, could spend a billy on my house
Could spend 2 more on my spouse
Could have a fucking Spice Girl all up in my spice whip
Young and aware, how you fucking doing that
Whipping with that silverware, now you out here making stacks

[Chorus]
Now go ahead, chef
And super, chef
Now go ahead, chef
And super, chef
Now go ahead, chef
And super, chef
Now go ahead, chef
And super, chef
