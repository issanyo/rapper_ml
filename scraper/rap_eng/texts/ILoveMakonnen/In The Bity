[Verse 1]
Songs I made for you and you don't care one cent
All I do is put on for you and your set
Well maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right
I'll be your star, shining every night
You'll be my sun bright as the day
And I'll be the thing that you take away
And it's so crazy, you was my baby
Now you singing to me, singing come back

[Hook]
Well can I meet you in the city
By the ocean at the marina
I really wanna, really wanna see ya this time
And say what's on my mind
So you can meet me
At the ocean, in the mountains, in the city
I really wanna, really wanna make some time
And hear what's on your mind

[Verse 2]
Every night I dream of you
And every day you're my big dream
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say
Maybe it will, maybe it won't
And I don't care if you don't
Your actions speak louder than words
And I just need you

[Hook]
Well can I meet you in the city
By the ocean at the marina
I really wanna, really wanna see ya this time
And say what's on my mind
So you can meet me
In the ocean, by the mountains, or the city
You really wanna, really wanna make some time
And say what's on your mind

[Verse 3]
Every time I think I should be with someone else
You call my name in the night
You just haunt my hotel
And I can't lie, I really like when I hear you
Scream my name
Maybe it's joy, or maybe it's pain
But i'll be here, all the same

[Hook]
So can I meet you in the city
By the ocean at the marina
I really wanna, really wanna see ya this time
And say what's on my mind
So can you meet me
In the ocean, by the mountains, or the bity
I really wanna, really wanna make some time
And hear what's on your mind
What's on your, what's on your mind
I really wanna, I really wanna, I really wanna
Make some, make some time
To hear what's on your mind
So can I meet you in bity
By the ocean at the marina
I really wanna, really wanna see you this time
And hear what's on your mind
So you can meet me
At the ocean, in the mountains, or the bity
Or the bity, you can meet me in the bity
Can i meet you in the bity or the marina?
Or at a zumma I really wanna see you
I really wanna meet you this time
And say what's on my mind
