[Verse 1]
Free like blue bird
We still fly high
Back when I had nothin' to hide
Out here givin' all that I got
Until I found, uh, until I found, uh
Someone that could whip like I do
And is in the deep ocean blue
I'm like, "Oh my God, I found you"
Now I'm in the stores, always sellin' with you, so...

[Hook]
I only trip with you
I only trip with you
I only trip with you
I only trip with you
I only trip with you
Goin' over the hills with you
Into the ocean blue
I only trip with you
Uh, I only trip with you
Hey, I only trip with you
I only trip with you
Goin' over the hills with you
Into the ocean blue

[Verse 2]
I see deep in your eyes
All the stars, to my surprise
The sky, is so wide
And I wonder why, I'm your guy
Blue bird when I fly high
Red dragon deep in the sky
The land's all in my eyes
To my surprise, hey

[Hook]
I only trip with you
I only trip with you
I only trip with you
I only trip with you
Goin' over the hills with you
Into the ocean blue
I only trip with you
I only trip with you
Hey, I only trip with you
Hey, I only trip with you
I only trip with you
Hey, I only trip with you
Goin' over the hills with you
Into the ocean blue

[Outro]
I only trip with you
I only trip with you
I only trip with you
Goin' over the hills with you
Into the ocean blue
