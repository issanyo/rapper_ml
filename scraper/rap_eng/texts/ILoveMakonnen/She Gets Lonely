[Chorus x2]
She said she gets lonely
And that's why she calls
She says that I'm the only one
That understands at all

[Verse 1]
She been through so much these past few years
These broken hearts and fighting tears
Breathing through her little soul
She says she's looking for a lover
Someone to come home and love her
I might just treat you right

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2]
We've been through so much these past few months
Leaving you for another one
Girls keep calling every night
But I've been looking for a lover
A girl so I could love her
I might just treat you right

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 3]
She been through so much these past few years
Broken hearts and fighting tears
People walking out her life
