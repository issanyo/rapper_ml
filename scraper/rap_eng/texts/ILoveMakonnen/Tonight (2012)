[Verse]
Brianna I've been thinking about you doing the things
That you do
In Atlanta there's no girls like you, they don't dance the way
That you do
But I, I think that you should be right here
Next to me
Like you said you would

[Pre-hook]
But you've been cheating on, cheating on me
And I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I been cheating too

[Hook]
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

[Verse 2]
I've heard you've been doing these things that
You really don't like
I've seen, you just changed your jeans so you can
Be where that flight

[Hook]
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

[Verse 3]
I hope you enjoy your room
Alone
Don't be crying now
Those days are gone

[Hook]
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
So tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

[Pre-hook]
For you, tonight is for you
Is for you, you, you
Is for you, you

[Hook]
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

[Outro]
Tonight is for you
I've made this for you
