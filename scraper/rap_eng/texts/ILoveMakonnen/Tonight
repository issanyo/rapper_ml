[Pre-hook]
I've been thinking about you doing the things that you do
In Atlanta, there's no girls like you, they don't dance the way that you do
But I, I think that you should be right here next to me
Like you said you would

[Hook]
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
So I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me, Brianna
So I've been cheating too
Tonight tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

[Verse]
I've heard you've been doing these things that you really don't like
I've seen, you just changed dreams so you can be on that flight

[Pre-Hook]
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight in Atlanta
There's no girls like you, they don't dance the way that you do, in Atlanta
There's no girls like you, they don't dance the way that you do
But I, I think that you should be right here next to me
Like you said you would, but, but...

[Hook]
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
So I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me, Brianna
So I've been cheating too
Tonight tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Brianna, doing that you do

[Pre-hook]
In Atlanta
There's no girls like you, they don't dance the way that you do
And I, I think that you should be right here next to me
Like you said you would, but...

[Hook]
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
So I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me, Brianna
So I've been cheating too
So I've been cheating too
So I've been cheating too
Tonight tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

[Outro]
Tonight is for you
I've made this for you
Tonight is for you
I've made this for you
