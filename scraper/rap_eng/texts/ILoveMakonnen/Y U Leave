[Chorus]
Why you keep leaving me, if you keep coming back
Why you keep deceiving me and hurting me like that
Why you keep leaving me, Why you keep coming back
Why you keep deceiving me, why hurt me like that

[Verse 1]
Why you hurt me, why you hurt me so bad
I've been crying trying to understand, what's wrong with us
I'm longing for your touch, but you leave and you run away
I wished you stayed, can't deceive me, not today
But you won't stay, so

[Chorus]
Why you leave
If you keep coming back, why you do me like that
Why you leave
If you keep coming back and hurting my heart
Why'd you leave if you keep coming back, hurting my heart
Why'd you leave if you keep coming back, hurting my heart

[Verse 2]

I can't take no more hurt no yeah sometimes I wanna cry
When you walk away, makes me feel like we have nothing
And when your in my face, it makes me wonder if your fronting

[Chorus]
So why'd you leave, if you keep coming back
Why you do me like that

Why'd you leave, if you keep coming back
