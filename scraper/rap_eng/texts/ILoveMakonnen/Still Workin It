Young, rich, I'm a made nigga, I'm sorry, can't fuck wit ya
Can't fit in the rubber band
Young nigga, I'm walkin' 'round with a hunnid bands
I don't really teach how to whip it, plug too far, gotta ship it

Rich nigga walk round with the racks out
Teen bitch, I'mma smash her with her ass out
I whip another brick at my mama's house
