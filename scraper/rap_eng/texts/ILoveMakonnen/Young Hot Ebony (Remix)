(Verse 1: Father)
She just want sharehold
Cause I'm young pharaoh
Tutankhamen, oh she cummin'
Ain't got shit in common
But dick in stomach, oh for sure
She locomotive, she trained to go
Cocaine in nose, she's like "Who's your plug?"
You don't need to know
Just sit there and shut the fuck up and get throwed
Lay there and play Nintendo Wii, girl
"You can't tell me what to do, boy"
Just don't smoke all my weed, bitch
Just watch your boy glow

(Hook x2)
Oh for sure
She locomotive, she trained to go
How I know? Wet Chevy seat
Young hot ebony, young hot ebony

(Verse 2: iLoveMakonnen)
She just wants some coke with a little rum
Supa clean red dragon make a bitch go dumb
Uh, and you know I’m bout my funds
We making music, we having fun
My goof so dope, she’s like ‘who’s your plug?’
I’m like OVO, so sit back, shut the fuck up
And get throwed
Or the grams you won’t go
Bitch, don’t smoke all my dro
Leave your problems at the door
And to the 5th dimension we go

(Hook 2: iLoveMakonnen & Father)
Oh for sure
We locomotive, I'm trained to go
How I know? All over seas
Trappin’ off the sheets
Young LSD
Oh for sure
She locomotive, she trained to go
How I know?
Yeah
Wet Chevy seat
Young hot ebony, young hot ebony

(Verse 3: Rich Po Slim)
In the trenches with wenches, my game is ridiculous
I’m training these bitches to go and get riches
Popeyes my meal, she pay for my biscuits
Fogo de Chão, she feedin' me brisket
Ass is explicit, her mouth is exquisite
But if she were broke, then I wouldn't visit
Ain't trained to go get it, then I ain't even with it
Cash in my mouth, I’m talkin' in digits
Pay attention, I'm loud, these niggas all midgets
Where bitches can't stand me, sipping on Brandy
Off of my lingo, they can’t understand me
Like hood rat freaks, swoops and thangs
Cause she spin on my dick like helicopter blades
And let me shake my dreads all between her legs
From ATL and TTG, please don’t ever leave your freak 'round me
