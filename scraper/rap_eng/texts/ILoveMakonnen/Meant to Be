[Hook]
You had my heart right from the start
When you said that we, you said that we would always be
But now I see that we're not meant to be
Cause you were loving someone else when I was looking at you
And I was loving someone else when you were looking at me
I think that it's plain to see that we're just not meant to be
Cause you were loving someone else when I was looking at you
And I was loving someone else when you were looking at me
I think that it's plain to see that we're just not meant to be

[Verse 1]
I think about you, Lisa [?], all the days that we spent together
I think about you, Charlotte, and all the things that you said
Ooh, girl, I don't want to ever lose, girl
Why you gonna make me act this way?
You know you feel my pain

[Hook]
Cause you had my heart right from the start
When you said that we, you said that we would always be
But now I see that we're not meant to be
Cause you were loving someone else when I was looking at you
And I was loving someone else when you were looking at me
I think that it's plain to see that we're just not meant to be

[Verse 2]
I think about you, Charlotte, I wonder how you are now
I think about your house that you bought, and the new car that you drive around
I think about those guys that turned you down and how you cried all in my arms
You said I was your angel, baby, and weathered you from any storm

[Hook]
You had my heart right from the start
When you said that we, you said that we would always be
But now I see that we're not meant to be
Cause you was loving someone else when I was looking at you
And I was loving someone else when you were looking at me
I think that it's plain to see that we're just not meant to be
You were loving someone else when I was looking at you
And I was loving someone else when you were looking at me
I think that it's plain to see that we're just not meant to be

[Bridge]
I used to cruise around, thinking 'bout these girls, and how I changed their life
I used to look at jewelry all the time for who I'd make my wife
I think about these girls all the time, I wonder who they're with and who's on their mind
They're not thinking 'bout me, at least right now
But they think about me when I'm in their town

[Hook]
Because I had their heart right from the start
When they said that we, they said that we would always be
But now they'll see that we're not meant to be
Cause I was loving someone else when they was looking at me
And she was loving someone else when I was looking at her
I think that it's plain to see that we're just not meant to be
Cause you was loving someone else when I was looking at you
And I was loving someone else when you were looking at me
I think that it's plain to see that we're just not meant to be

[Verse 3]
I think about Brianna, I think about you all the time
I think about Atlanta, and how they're changing your mind
