[Chorus]
I could fuck yo bitch
Make a hit (on my day to day)
Maybe roll a spliff and get lit (on my day to day)
You know Im legit, With the shits (on my day to day)
Looking up above fall in love (on my day to day)

[Verse 1: Michael Christmas]
I think the illuminati just followed me on twitter
I think they see my day to day is making waves amazing babes
I do the shows they say my name like Kelly Rowland Beyoncé
, I need not pay no mind to they lil comments if they hate they hate
Like who could tell me different, get off my vas deferens
Day to day from daily one year later still ain't no vast difference
Eating breakfast at Tiffany's, lunch with Leila, then my mom came and woke me, it fucked my day up

[Chorus]

[Hook]
Day to Day (x8)

[Verse 2: Tunji Ige]
Tell me all the I can things do
Wrote a couple songs about you
Cruising in the burbs
These Cul-de-sacs Will bring you blues
Said you just wanna be free
Might as well come follow me
Take you to my other home
In the heart of the city
Now you know that you bad
Know know that you bad
And I hate to see you sad
Gave you every thing I had but
In a basement in Pennsylvania
Writing songs of my heart just entertain ya (singing)

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ILoveMakonnen]
I hit the club with techno girls they really love the ecstasy
They say Makonnen your the one that I only want next to me
Your sex and love is all I need and plus you keep the best weed
Your friends are really super cool like Mikey Christmas and Tunji
Use me, abuse me, and take all my love away
I don't really care what you really want to do today
So lets have some fun tonights not promised to me or you tonight
But I really don't wanna loose this time right now so…

[Chorus]
