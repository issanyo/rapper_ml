[Verse]
I'll call you back just to see where you at
Hopin' you don't mind
And I'll answer your text, never tryna flex
Givin' you all my time
Now sometimes I think, me and you on the brink
Of losin' it all
And I wonder if you'll still be down
If I happen to fall

[Chorus]
Now I think about the girls that get loose with me
And they ain't ever really tryna lose with me
I really like the girls that get loose with me
Cause they ain't here when I'm losin'
They ain't here when I'm losin'
I really like the girls that get loose with me
And they ain't ever really tryna lose with me
I really like the girls that get loose with me
Cause they ain't here when I'm losin'
They ain't here when I'm losin'

[Verse]
I'll call you back just to see where you at
Hopin' you don't mind
And I'll answer your text, never tryna flex
Givin' you all my time
Now sometimes I think, me and you on the brink
Of losin' it all
And I wonder if you'll still be down
If I happen to fall

[Chorus]
Now I think about the girls that get loose with me
And they ain't ever really tryna lose with me
I really like the girls that get loose with me
Cause they ain't here when I'm losin'
They ain't here when I'm losin'
I really like the girls that get loose with me
And they ain't ever really tryna lose with me
I really like the girls that get loose with me
Cause they ain't here when I'm losin'
They ain't here when I'm losin'

[Bridge]
Now someone else who could treat you better if I'm not there
Someone else who could love you better, if I, if I didn't care
I wouldn't sing about you the way I do
About you the way I do

[Chorus]
Now I think about the girls that get loose with me
And they ain't ever really tryna lose with me
I really like the girls that get loose with me
Cause they ain't here when I'm losin'
They ain't here when I'm losin'
I really like the girls that get loose with me
And they ain't ever really tryna lose with me
I really like the girls that get loose with me
Cause they ain't here when I'm losin'
They ain't here when I'm losin'

[Outro]
They ain't here if I'm losin'
