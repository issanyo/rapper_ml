[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Like 'em, yeah
Oh my god, Ronny

[Chorus]
I'm all 'bout my checks like them Nike (Nike boy)
But I can't kick it (I can't kick it)
I'm striped up in the streets like Adidas boy (Adidas boy)
But I can't kick it (I can't kick it)
I'm all 'bout my checks like them Nike (like them Nike)
But I can't kick it (I can't kick it)
I'm striped up in the streets like Adidas (like Adidas)
But I can't kick it (I can't kick it)

[Verse 1]
I can't kick it, I can't kick it, I ain't fuckin' kick shit (shit)
I'm out here in the kitchen, whippin' up the bricks
I need money, I need money, I need more than I have
'Cause I never grew up with a rich, fuckin' dad
Plus my mom, plus my mom, she was single mom
She havin' kids, she had
Had to get it on her own
Once I finally found out what was really doing on
I told my momma sit down and I'ma get you a new home

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm all 'bout these checks like Nike, yeah (yeah)
That's why I don't kick it (I don't kick it)
I'm striped up in those streets like Adidas, yeah (yeah)
That's why I can't kick it (I can't kick it)
I'm all 'bout my checks like them Nike, yeah (yeah)
I don't kick it (but I don't kick it)
I'm striped up in those streets like Adidas, yeah, ayy
That's why I can't kick it (I can't kick it)

[Verse 2]
I'm on the block, I'm on the block
I steady serve the white
I remember some nights, I had to serve the brown
I wasn't proud of what I did, man I had fuckin' frowns
I lost so many fuckin' friends, I buried them in the ground
I been cryin', I been cryin' so many fuckin' tears
Nowadays, like me, I don't know what to fear
I ain't scared of shit, I ain't scared of that
I'm really, of scared of becomin' a fuckin' vet
'Cause, man I love my young life and man I really love it
Stayin' out all night, I don't put nothin' to pub it
I'm all about this money, man I really love the green
That's why I'm always fuckin' sellin' on any fuckin' thing

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm all 'bout these checks like Nike, yeah (yeah)
So I can kick it (I can kick it)
I'm striped up in those streets like Adidas, yeah, ayy
That's why I don't kick it (I don't kick it)
Boy, I'm all 'bout these checks like Nike, yeah (yeah)
So I can kick it (I can kick it)
I'm striped up in those streets like Adidas, yeah (yeah)
So I don't kick it (I don't kick it)
I'm all 'bout my checks like them Nike, yeah (all about my checks, yeah)
That's why I don't kick it (I don't kick it)
Stay striped up in those streets like Adidas, yeah (yeah)
So I can kick it now (I can kick it)

[Outro]
So I can kick it (I can kick it)
Well, I can kick it now
I can kick it now
I can kick it, yeah
