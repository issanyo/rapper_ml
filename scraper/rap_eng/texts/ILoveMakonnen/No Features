[Intro]
...all my friends poppin' pills, sellin' drugs, tweakin'
All my shit the best shit, nigga it's some vet shit
I'm a little rookie, on 'em, though, I'm playin' like a veteran
God damn, hold up
Yeah you keep runnin' that shit
Shouts out to that boy Danny Wolf though
H-h-hoodrich (Hoodrich, Hoodrich)
Yeah, cause you know

[Hook]
All on the weekends, sippin' swervin', leanin'
All my shit the best shit, nigga what you meanin'?
All on the weekends, sippin' swervin', leanin'
All my shit the best shit, nigga what you meanin'?
We don't need no features boy, huh, we don't need no features
Ayy, yo, we don't need no features boy, huh, we don't need no features, nah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, we don't need no features boy
I'm out here being teacher, boy
Teach the wave all day
Niggas wanna learn and play
Goddamn, what school you at?
Super Chef with the hat
Fuck around in the kitchen, make that magic turn to goddamn
Super carpets like Aladdin and all
I be ballin' every spring, summer, winter and fall
Give a fuck about who skatin'
Give a fuck about who hatin'
Know I'm out here doin' great shit
Nigga what you meanin' though?

[Hook]
I'm swervin' on the weekends, sippin' swervin', leanin'
All my shit the best shit, nigga what you meanin'?
All on the weekends, sippin' swervin', leanin'
All my shit the best shit, nigga what you meanin'?
We don't need no features boy, huh, we don't need no features
Damn, oh, we don't need no features boy, huh, we don't need no features, nah

[Verse 2]
Every song I could freestyle, nigga count bands
That's your bitch in the town, she know that I'm the man
Snapchat all night from your hoes all night
Tell that bitch to call my phone, I might buy your bitch a flight
Cause I'm swervin' on the weekend, only stay singin'
Had my friends poppin' pills, sellin' drugs, tweakin'
All my shit the best shit, nigga it's some vet shit
I'm a little rookie on 'em, though I'm playin' like a veteran

[Hook]
I'm swervin' on the weekends, sippin' swervin', leanin'
All my shit the best shit, nigga what you meanin'?
All on the weekends, sippin' swervin', leanin'
All my shit the best shit, nigga what you meanin'?
We don't need no features boy, huh, we don't need no features
Damn, oh, we don't need no features boy, huh, we don't need no features, damn
