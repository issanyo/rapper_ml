[Intro: ILoveMakonnen]
Ohh, ohh
Aye, aye
Ohh

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
Like I can't even take it no more, no
I see them tryna steal the flow, uh
And I can't let it go, no
Like I can't even take it no more, no
I see them tryna steal the flow, uh
And I can't let it go, no

[Verse 1: ILoveMakonnen]
I see them cooking at they shows
Doin' this in Rolls, Royce
I pull up, give 'em no choice
They fucking with the old boys, like
I mix it with the caffeine and damn I start wildin'
Making so much money I could buy my own island
Slow it down for what? No
All these kids just sound like y'all
And y'all sound like us
So miss us with that fuss
Boys chillin' on the bus
They listenin' to us
And riding in that new thing names you can't pronounce
You know we hottest in the north and best in the south, boy

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
Like I can't even take it no more, no
I see them tryna steal the flow, uh
And I can't let it go, no
Like I can't even take it no more, no
I see them tryna steal the flow, uh
And I can't let it go, no

[Verse 2: ILoveMakonnen]
Players out here cookin' every time they scorin'
Needin' video time when they recordin'
Niggas out here frontin' like we ain't just the ones
So I show 'em what the sun do and burn they ass up
They like oh shit whose there all in that new black?
How the fuck they doin' it?
Must be that magic trick
Oh shit, got your bitch
Hangin' with the boy
They like yeah y'all boys is poor
I'm like boy we makin' more
Than you could ever dream up
I know that you seen us
Everybody hangin' out they really tryna be us

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
Like I can't even take it no more, no
I see them tryna steal the flow, uh
And I can't let it go, no
Like I can't even take it no more, no
I see them tryna steal the flow, uh
And I can't let it go, no

[Verse 3: Lil B]
I can't fuck with the niggas like that
Celebratin' all day with the money in the bag
Still cookin' swag at the same damn time
Heard the radio, ain't that my line?
Heard the radio, ain't that my swag?
Gotta take it back, I just gotta take it back
This the new wave, got lost in the sea
Can't be them, I just wanna be me
I love Lil B, is he goin' on tour?
Stop stealin' swag, leave the hate at the door
Keep it so real but the game so fake
All the DJs just smile in your face
All the DJs just turn up the bass
Everybody go wild in the place
All the DJs just turn up the bass
Everybody go wild in the place
How you gon' feel if you don't get a deal?
Would you stop rappin' or would you keep it real?
How you gon' feel goin' platinum and gold?
One million views, one million sold
I gotta live my life, I just gotta live my life
I'm comin' to the party where you hangin' out tonight
All I do is win, I just want that cash money
Number one stunna, it's the BasedGod fucker
Keep it too real while they steal off my plate
Watchin' TV, might as well be my face
Gotta be patient, work while I wait
Made history, so why would I hate?
Any more singers, rappers, pop stars
Gotta watch they back, they know we comin' super charged
I don't even care about the money or the fame
Music is my life, music is my name
Everybody talkin' about pains in the gain
I'ma come back like runnin' through the track
Sellin' off packs like
Money in the back like
Who they wanna rap like?
Who they wanna rap like?
Who they wanna rap like?
Who they wanna rap like?
Who they wanna rap like?
Who they wanna rap like?
Can't even act tight but we gon' take that
Might as well jack that
Let me get my swag back
Let me get my swag back
Let me get my swag back
Let me get my swag back
Let me get my swag back

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
Like I can't even take it no more, no
I see them tryna steal the flow, uh
And I can't let it go, no
Like I can't even take it no more, no
I see them tryna steal the flow, uh
And I can't let it go, no
