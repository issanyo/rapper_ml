[Verse 1]
One time for Makonnen cause you know his style wild
Put $100,000 in ya' favorite girl account
14 carrots in ya' boy ear, 35 go for 40 over here
Shut up girl, you don't know our lingo
I LOVE MAKONNEN turn a song to a single
Thirsty at the party, hell no, we can't mingle
Make a lot of chips off the flavors like Pringles
Selling the dope we get risky, NYPD don't stop and frisk me
Keep it OG and ya' bound to get plenty
Mothafuckas' mad cause we known in every city and

[Hook]
Downtown, on 21st street
We take it all around the town in 21st street
Money going up-town, money going downtown
Money going up-town, money going downtown
Money going up-town, money going downtown
Money going up, money going down

[Verse 2]
Ballin' on hoes, you know I do
Have racks over there on North Druid
Hate on me, for what? I don't know
Spray on thee, the beef is a go
I know what to do get whisky
All the time these fuckas' hatin on me.. Oh whoa, whoa
36 nines, too high for a bike
Slap your face twice 'till your ass get it right
Shay on me callin' the po' po'
Saying he's bringing the most dope
When you know that tale is a mothafuckin' lie
Cause I'm the smartest guy in the FBI
Made 2003 on the S.A.T and sold a fuckin' pound at the A.C.T
Ask the pimps in your town if they know about me
Cause I'm something that the legends all aspired to be
On 21st street, I make my money downtown

[Bridge]
Downtown, down, down, downtown
I make my money down, downtown on 21st street
I'm taking it all around the town
