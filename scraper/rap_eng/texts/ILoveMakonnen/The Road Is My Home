[Verse 1]
I've been all alone
Walking around, searching for a new home
And I, no, I don't mind
Being alone in the night
Now we, now we'll never be
Cause you never want to leave with me

[Chorus]
And so I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
On the road, the road is my home
And now I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
On the road, the road is my home

[Verse 2]
Now I, now I don't mind
Being in the dark, driving at night
I, I really like
Seeing the stars in my life
Now we could never be
Cause you never want to leave with me
And I don't want to stay around in your town

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I've been seeing all these things that I've never
Seen in the daytime at home
And I'm leaving, never coming back
Not any new seasons, winter or fall

[Chorus]
