[Intro]

[Hook]
I'm counting paper that comes from the trees
I'm steady counting paper that comes from the trees
I'm counting paper that comes from the trees
I'm steady counting paper that comes from the trees

[Verse 1]
Niggas hope that I would be selling dope
I take your bitch and fuck it, sell her throat
Cause I need more than I ever had
Fuck around, I could take your damn dad
I be balling, I'm never fucking stalling 'less I restroom
Motherfucker know that I'm at the breast room
Filling up cause I got big milks
Round here I feel like Harvey Milk
Damn, they say Makonnen you the gate man
Holy shit, you know I get paid man
Yeah, and now I play like Pacman
Tell me what happened, I don't know

[Hook]
Steady counting paper that comes from the trees

I'm steady counting paper that comes from the trees

[Verse 2]
Niggas hope that I would be selling dope
I take your bitch and hit the block and fuck it, sell her throat
Cause I need more than I ever had
I know you're mad cause I could take your dad
I'm balling, never fucking stalling at the restroom
You know I'm probably out here at the breast room
With a MILF cause I'm trying fill up
Yeah, they wanna motherfucking feel us
Hey, bitch hit us with a deal cause
I be moving on like dill pickles
Split it all in the fucking jar
I feel like the evil lion, like Jafar

I'm steady counting paper that comes from the trees

[Verse 3]
I made a hundred just last week
Got five hundred coming as we speak
Young nigga like me pulling up to airports
All fucking day, nigga looking like the airforce
Holy shit, I didn't fucking think that that rhyme would make sense
But it seems to make more dollars
I make a bitch holla
Niggas know in college that I'm a top scholar

[Hook]
I'm steady counting paper that comes from the trees
I'm steady counting paper that comes from the trees
I'm counting paper that comes from the trees

I never fall unless I'm saying please
They always fall unless they on their knees
I never fall unless I'm saying please
They always fall unless they on their knees
