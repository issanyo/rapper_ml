[Intro]
I couldn't let you go
I couldn't let you go

[Verse 1]
You cheated, I lied
I said I love you for all time
You said you loved me until I die
And now it's killing me inside
Sometimes I wonder who I have
Sometimes I wonder if you're still bad
I think about going back
But I'm a little shy

[Hook]
So blow a kiss for me no matter where you are
I know you're missing me cause I know that you are
And Lately my heart's been beating for you
I know you feel the same way too
So blow a kiss, kiss, kiss for me
Blow a kiss, kiss, kiss for me
Blow a kiss, kiss, kiss for me

[Verse 2]
I cheated, you lied
I said I love you until you die
You said you'd be here all night
And now it's killing you inside
I heard you wonder who you have
I see you wonder if I'm still mad
I know you're thinking bout coming back
But you're a little shy

[Hook]
So blow a kiss for me no matter where you are
I know you're missing me cause I know that you are
And Lately my heart's been beating for you
I know you feel the same way too
So blow a kiss, kiss, kiss for me
Blow a kiss, kiss, kiss for me
Blow a kiss, kiss, kiss for me

[Outro Hook]
Blow a kiss for me no matter where you are
I know you're missing me cause I know that you are
Been beating for you
Know you feel the same way too
So blow a kiss, kiss, kiss for me
Blow a kiss, kiss for me
Blow a kiss, kiss for me
Blow a kiss, kiss, kiss for me
Blow a kiss, kiss, kiss for me
Blow a kiss
