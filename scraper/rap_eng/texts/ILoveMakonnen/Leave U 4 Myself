[Hook 1] (x2)
I had to leave you for myself
I had to leave you for myself
I heard you seeing someone else
I couldn't be with no one else

[Verse 1]
So I had to leave you for myself
I had to leave you on your own
I had to leave you in the cold
And now you're screaming on your own
I like you barely caught my phone
I had to leave you for myself
Cause you was seeing someone else
You didn't care about my health
You only being for my wealth
I had to leave you for myself
Cause you was seeing someone else
I couldn't be with no one else
I had to leave you for myself

[Hook 2]
I had to leave you for myself
Cause you was seeing someone else
I couldn't be with no one else

[Verse 2]
I had to leave you for myself
Just how you left me in the cold
Now you left me to grow old
Kinda bitter all alone
You left me bitter by the stone
I had to speak to myself
Like do I really love myself
How could I be with someone else
When you was seeing someone else

[Hook 2] (x2)
I had to leave you for myself
Cause you was seeing someone else
I couldn't be with no one else

[Verse 3]
It seems like, now we barely talk
You run past when I try walk
You wear it at your work
Now you swear that I'm a jerk
Could I, I leave you for myself
Cause you was seeing someone else
I couldn't be with no else
So, I had to leave you for myself

[Outro]
I had to leave you for myself
Cause you was seeing someone else
I had to leave you for myself
I couldn't be with no one else
I had to leave you for myself
I couldn't be with no one else
Cause you was seeing someone else
I had to leave you for myself
