[Verse 1]
You have to breathe it in nowadays.....
I take you to the movie and I treat you like a groupie
And you don’t mind
I show you round the town and I dine you with the finest
And it’s a great time

Your friends say that I’m horny but you know I make you horny
You say that you don’t love me but you barely try to hug me
And when we’re on the floor you always wanna get next to me
And probably try to rub me and put me under the rug but
I don’t wait too long for you to call
I, mmm, be probably running home for your alarm

[Hook]
But you left and that’s not right when I didn’t front on you
I didn’t front on you
And now you comin' back, back, back, back, back, back, back again
But you left and that’s not right when I didn’t front on you
I didn’t front on you
And now you comin' back, back, back, back, back, back, back again, uhhh

[Verse 2]
You say that you don’t need me but I know that you need me
You feeling kinda greedy
I say that I don’t love you but you know that I love you
You tell me when I touch you
You ride around, top down, just cruisin'
Me and you, having a good time not losing

[Hook]
But you left and that’s not right when I didn’t front on you
I didn’t front on you
And now you comin' back, back, back, back, back, back, back again, yeah
But you left and that’s not right when I didn’t front on you
I didn’t front on you
And now you comin' back, back, back, back, back, back, back again, yeah

[Bridge]
Tell me if you’re horny cause I know that you get horny
And last night you don't call me
You meet me in the morning but you do it every night
And you swear that you don’t stuff me
I don't like, it's our [?]
And I spend time trying to be with you

[Hook]
But you left and that’s not right when I didn’t front on you
I didn’t front on you
And now you come in back, back, back, back, back again, uhhh
You left and that’s not right when I didn’t front on you
I didn’t front on you
And now you come in back, back, back, back, back again, uhhh

[Outro]
Cause you left and that’s not right when I didn’t front on you
I didn’t front on you
And now you come in back, back again
You left and that’s not right when I didn’t front on you
I didn’t front on you
And now you come in back, back again, yeah
