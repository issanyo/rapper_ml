[Intro]
Aye somebody might be pulling up

Aye, yeah, aye, yeah, aye, yeah
Aye, yeah, aye, yeah, aye, yeah

[Hook]
I call my plug on the phone like "Trust me Danny"
I'ma take it out of town and bring you plenty
They be ready for it, they be ready for it
I be riding through the woods, city, and the forest
I call my plug on the phone like "Trust me Danny"
I'ma take it out of town and bring you fetti
They be ready for it, they be ready for it
I be riding through the woods, city, and the forest

[Verse 1]
I'm still busting on the highways breaking jugs down
Still have ‘bout fifty pills, still moving half a pound
Shouts out to that southside, it still go down
You can see me on old national, fucking with that brown
Who god damn pull up, when’s the last time you did?
I was 'round there, I say, around like Easter bitch
All in my Easter fit, in front of Zaxby's
Smoking on that blue shit, bitches come and catch me

[Hook]
I call my plug on the phone like "Trust me Danny"

They be ready for it, they be ready for it
I be riding through the woods, city, and the forest
I call my plug on the phone like "Trust me Danny"
I'ma take it out of town and bring you fetti
They be ready for it, they be ready for it
I be riding through the woods, city, and the forest

[Verse 2]
Smoking on a Backwoods, I feel like HoodRich Keem
Shouts out DJ Spinz and the HoodRich team
I be all in Atlanta, zone three to zone six
Still posted up at the gas station with your bitch
All in Atlantic Station, tell me where your destination?
You know I could make it happen
I'm the man, I feel like captain
Ride around with that hoe, you know I got red and blue
Shouts out to the…oh, shouts out to myself too
Because we out here doing it
All my shit the coolest
Girl what you doing there? Fuck around and lose it
Had that, uh, on there too, fuck around with that white
We're gonna move it all damn night, all damn night

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I be still riding hard in my black van
I remember switching lanes with no damn chains
Now a nigga got pinkie rings, it like six damn chains
I don’t even like to stunt, but I got us on the scene
All those stupid ass hoes who was hating from before
How you doing, how you doing? Get away from my door
What’s that shit to a butterfly? Now I fly off in the sky
I'ma catch a red-eye, you be catching no eyes

[Hook]
I call my plug on the phone like "Trust me Danny"
I'ma take it out of town and bring you plenty
They be ready for it, they be ready for it
I be seeing them in the woods, city, and the forest
They be fiendin' for Makonnen all goddamn night
I give 'em that red dragon when I take off in flight
They be ready for it, they be ready for it
I be all in the woods, city and the forest

[Outro]
I call my plug on the phone like "Trust me Danny"
Like "Trust me Danny, like "Trust me Danny"
