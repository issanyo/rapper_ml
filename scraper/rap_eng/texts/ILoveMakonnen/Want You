[Verse 1]
It feel like years but it was just last weekend
That me and you were speaking
On your couch looking out into the stars
Now, I can't remember what, what even
Drew us in, that weekend
To become so close from the start
Now, I'm still...stalling
Wonder if I should call when
You come across my mind

[Chorus]
Cause I wonder, if you want me
The way I want you
The way I want you
For our love, I'm waiting
Are you waiting too? Are you waiting too?

[Verse 2]
We even text on the weekdays
You said your time would never be easy
But you're still making time for mine
And I still wonder if you're thinking
About me when you're reading
Those other guys'


And I wonder, if you want me
The way I want you
The way I want you
For our love, I'm waiting
Are you waiting too? Are you waiting too?
