[Verse 1]
How do you think it makes me feel coming here to your grave?
Oh it's been so damn long knowing you since the 8th grade
I can't sleep at night knowing that you're not here
And so I change my life, living each day without fear

[Chorus]
They don't really love you 'til you die
Then it's too late and they wonder why
They don't really love you 'til you die
Then it's too late

[Verse 2]
Oh Ashley, could it be so bad, that you can't even call my phone?
And Whitney, don't do me like that, don't ever leave me all alone
'Cause when I had no one, you were there for me
We made all this music together
So I'ma love you now and cherish thee
'Cause I know we won't live forever

[Chorus]
They won't really love us 'til we die
Then it's too late and they wonder why
That they don't really love you 'til you die
Then it's too late
They don't really love you 'til you die
Then it's too late and they wonder why
That they don't really love you 'til you die
Then it's too late
They don't really love you 'til you die
Late and they wonder why
That they don't really love you 'til you die
Then it's too late

[Outro]
But I will always love you
I will always love you, you, you
Will always love you, you, and you
