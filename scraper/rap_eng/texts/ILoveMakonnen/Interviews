(Yeah. I'll fix myself man.  Put the Gucci bag on. Gucci belt, Gucci hat, Gucci Glasses)

[Intro: iLoveMakonnen]
They hit you like to cut the grass
Sixty seven thousand for your ass
They hit you like to cut the grass
Sixty seven thousand for your ass

[Verse: iLoveMakonnen]
The girls don’t really dance off in the hood no more
They found a new route to New Mexico
Where slavery for the sex gets you money
Was lavy for the sex, we buying honey
Cold world out here giving all
Losing it all for some drugs

[Chorus: iLoveMakkonnen]
So if you feel how I feel
Why don’t you let it show?
And if you ain’t dealing what I deal with
Why don’t you let it go?

(Verse)
Put the game critical, straight here for some scissor
Down I’m balling free before
I take out my residual
Uuh girl just look at you, uuh girl you so cute
Do, you do interviews
Do, you do interviews
Didn’t mean to interview x 2
Wanna see what’s up to you
Baby what’s up to you
Didn’t mean get low from my move but maybe I get in love with you
Ain’t my mother proud of you now wanna met your mother too

[Chorus]

(Verse)
You scream too much for me, you cry
You scream to much for me, I wander why
You always complaining
Don’t know what you’re saying

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Yung Gleesh]
Hit the sprite with the lean
Then I make it darker
Hit that bitch with the wallet
Then I hit your daughter
Skip that shutting out of friend ship
Know I’m getting shelter

[Chorus]

[Hook]
