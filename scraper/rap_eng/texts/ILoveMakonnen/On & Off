[Verse 1 ]
Riding out to Vegas state ,thursday night
Nothin but pretty stars in our sight 
Leaving you at the hotel all alone
Have  me running from messages on my phone 

[Hook ]
And now it's summer let's get it back on again
But remember last when you , when  you never would call again
I guess it's thing that we do know we should get it back on again
But the last time it was cold you said you never call again

[Verse 2]
Flying to Portland at last, friday night
I kissed you on your lips before you took your red eye
I listen to the things that you say all the time
And it makes me think that me and you aren't right

[Hook (powerfull) ]
But now it's summer you wanna  get it back on again
I remember last  when you said you never would  call again
I guess it's things that that we do know you wanna  get it back on again
But when things were cold you said you never would call again

[Chorus (powerfull) ]
And now we goin' on & off , and on & off  and on & off and on & off
Again again again
And now we goin' on & off , and on & off  and on & off and on & off
Again again again

[Hook]
And now that it's summer you wanna get it back on again
But  i remember when last when you said you  never would call again
I guess it's things that we do know we can  get it back on again
But when things were cold you said you never would call again

[Chorus ]
And now we goin' on & off , and on & off  and on & off and on & off
Again again again
And now we goin' on & off , and on & off  and on & off and on & off
Again again again
