I don't tell you how I feel
'Cause I'm afraid you don't feel the same
I don't tell you how I feel
'Cause I'm afraid you don't feel the same
And it's been killin' me, sometimes
It's been killin' me, inside
I don't tell you how I feel
I'm afraid you don't feel the same
'Cause I'm afraid you don't feel the same
And it's been killin' me, sometimes
It's been killin' me, inside

I don't tell you how I feel
'Cause I'm afraid you don't feel the same
I don't tell you how I feel
'Cause I'm afraid you don't feel the same
And it's been killin' me, sometimes
It's been killin' me, inside
I don't tell you how I feel
I'm afraid you don't feel the same
'Cause I'm afraid you don't feel the same
And it's been killin' me, sometimes
And it's been killin' me, inside

I don't tell you how I feel
