[Hook]
So on Sundays, I hustle like it's Monday
Cause too much ain't enough, and enough ain't too much, no

[Verse 1]
I think about those Philly girls
The one I let get all in my world
Tryna hit 'em with the diamonds and pearls
But they've been wantin' somethin' more than Earth
I don't think that I should be with you
Cause you ain't faithful to me
All the things we talk about in our texts
All the things we watch on TV

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
I think about the bills that I have due
Ain't got nothin' to deal with you
So I don't wanna talk about it right now
Let me have some time to figure it out
I don't wanna stress you out
Havin' you sayin' things come out your mouth
That you don't mean when you say it
Girl lets just stop all this playin'

[Hook] x2
