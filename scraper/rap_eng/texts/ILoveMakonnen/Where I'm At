[Verse 1]
Two phones going ham, aye
Two phones going ham, aye
Two phones going ham
Watch them things triple double
Word around the town, me and my boys in trouble
We be acting bad but we keep the best work
We be with Jamaicans and you know them chickens jerk
I be in the town, out here whipping all night
I'm tryna find a new place where I can come and fly
I be out here moving all the way from the north side
Still dropping packs off, all on the south side

[Hook]
They wanna know, where I'm at and when I'm coming back
They wanna know, where I'm at and when I'm coming back
They wanna know, where I'm at and when I'm coming back
Aye, aye, aye, aye

[Verse 2]
Shawty, won't you come record me?
All in the Florida, doing shows with stories
Huh, in a drop top, we don't even drop no more
Out here at the beach, got a penthouse on every floor
My coke is the boolest, all my shit is coolest
I got a big jar in the kitchen like some cool whip
It's sitting in the fridge, out here waiting for my, aye
Little brother pull up and he gon' move it today, aye

[Hook]
Where you at and when you coming back?
They wanna know, where I'm at and when I'm coming back
They wanna know, where I'm at and when I'm coming back
They wanna know, where I'm at and when I'm coming back
Aye, hey

[Verse 3]
Cause I'm still out here swerving, on the curb chirping
Yo what's up? Who need another [?] when...
You could probably pull up, we be doing pull ups
My kids been getting it since they been in pull-ups

[Hook]
Where you at and when you coming back?
They wanna know, where I'm at and when I'm coming back
They wanna know, where I'm at and when I'm coming back
They wanna know, where I'm at and when I'm coming back

[Outro: Normal Tempo]
They wanna know, where I'm at and when I'm coming back
They wanna know, where I'm at and when I'm coming back
They wanna know, where I'm at and when I'm coming back
They wanna know, where I'm at and when I'm coming back

[Outro: Slowed Tempo]
They wanna know, where I'm at and when I'm coming back
They wanna know, where I'm at and when I'm coming back
They wanna know, where I'm at and when I'm coming back
They wanna know, where I'm at and when I'm coming back
