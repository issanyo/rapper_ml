[Verse 1: Key!]
How the hell you fit fifty in the Glock?
Why your wristwatch won’t tock?
How you started way way at the bottom, aye
Now you way way way at the top?
How you the hell you stay real through the fake?
How you keep the faith?
How the hell they sleepin’ on you?
How the hell you stay awake?
I’m with your main thing tryna make a rerun
And I’m spilling lean in a Nissan
I’m a big dog, you’s a peon
I ain’t found a bitch I can’t pee on
Whole lot of money and the drugs don’t mix
When I’m off the shits rather not give a shit
Damn near got a Grammy but I’m still hitting licks
Still fuck a bitch, better yet suck a dick

This my fuckin’ movie flow
If you ain’t ever seen it, kick back
Press play, let the movie roll
I’m one on one, I’m Julio
Yeah I say touch down, make plays
My nigga far as my duties go
If you ain’t tryna get to the money
Then what you knew me for?
You ain’t say you do it for money
Then what you do me for?
Dangerous Minds, I’m feeling like I’m Coolio
Get it then I pass to my wolves, bitch I’m Rubio
Mississippi cold, I know, that’s two below
Boss shit, you a worker, they tell you to go
Squad on deck, we don’t never fold
Secrets of the pimping, nigga we ain’t never told
Fans they love me, that’s to death, unconditional
I’ma stay forever young, but three months, yo she getting’ old
My homie snipe her friend, that’s the pick and roll
Get it he gon’ run it back, pass it, that’s the give and go
