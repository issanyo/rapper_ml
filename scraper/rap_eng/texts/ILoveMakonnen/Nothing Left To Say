[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen & Lil Peep]
Can you just leave me alone?
Since our love is gone, (Our love is gone)
Nothing left to say, (Nothing left to say)
Since you walked away, (You walked away)
Can you just leave me alone? (Just leave me alone)
Since our love is gone, (Our love is gone)
Nothing left to say, (Nothing left to say)
Since you walked away, (You walked away)
