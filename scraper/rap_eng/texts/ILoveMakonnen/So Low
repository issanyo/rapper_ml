[Verse 1]
It feels like heaven, when I'm alone in mind
It feels like torture, when I'm alone with you

[Hook]
So, I don't wanna see your face no more
Cause you make me feel, make me feel, so low
And I don't wanna hear your voice no more
Cause you make me feel, make me feel, make me feel, so low

[Verse 2]
It feels like heaven, when I'm alone in my room
And it feels like hell, when I'm alone with you

[Hook]
So, I don't wanna see your face no more
Cause you make me feel, make me feel, so low
And I don't wanna hear your voice no more
Cause you make me feel, make me feel, make me feel, so low

[Outro]
It feels like heaven, when I'm alone in my room
And it feels like hell, when I'm alone with you
