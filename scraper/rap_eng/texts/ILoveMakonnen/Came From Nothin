[Intro]
Yeah, this shit on that periscope shit live
Yeah, this Danny Wolf shit too (D-D-D-Danny Wolf)
One take legend freestyle
Yeah, what

[Hook]
I really came from nothin', shit
So I ain't got nothin' to lose
I think that I should start frontin'
I'm tired of bein' the truth, shit
Because I really cam from nothin'
And I ain't got nothin' to lose
I think that I should start frontin'
Cause I'm tired of tellin' the truth

[Verse 1]
Nigga from the South side, real shit
Nigga pull up on that college park
See me down in Riverdale
Fuck around at flash hoes park
Shouts out to my home boys, know them niggas passed away
I told 'em I'mma get this money off this rap or this yay
Now every Tuesday, a nigga off in the club
Poppin' bottles, I don't drink, I'm steady rollin' up dubs
How my dubs look like halfs and my halfs look like wholes
I'm out here takin' all these bitches when I leave my show

[Hook]
I really came from nothin', shit
So I ain't got nothin' to lose
I think that I should start frontin'
I'm tired of bein' the truth, shit
Because I really cam from nothin'
And I ain't got nothin' to lose
I think that I should start frontin'
Cause I'm tired of tellin' the truth

[Verse 2]
Tell me who else, goddamn be whippin' it like I do?
I ain't see no nigga, I been off in every city too
Tryna find an equivalent, I'm seein' steady imitates
Fuck around shake my hand, later they gon' be a hater
Now or Later like the candy, nigga out here Randy Moss
I be out here catchin' plays, see a nigga dance and toss
All in the end zone, tell me what you hatin' for?
Makonnen is the best shit nigga in the States fasho, ugh

[Hook]
I really came from nothin', shit
So I ain't got nothin' to lose
I think that I should start frontin'
I'm tired of bein' the truth, shit
Boy I really cam from nothin', shit
And I ain't got nothin' to lose
I think that I should start frontin'
Cause... tired of bein' the truth

[Outro]
Tired of bein' the truth
Tied of bein' the truth
Man they don't appreciate that shit
Man they don't respect that shit
Tied of bein' the truth
