[Intro: I Love Makonnen]
I got gas on deck and you know that fool
I get everybody high in your middle school

[Verse 1: I Love Makonnen]
I'm riding 'round the city with the packs fucking servin'
Out here on 75 north just swervin'
Almost had an accident near Edgewood Ave
I don't give a fuck because I'm about to go make some stacks
Out here ear buggin', niggas out here frontin'
I Love Makonnen, he the best thing stuntin', yeah
And we don't give a fuck about y'all
We out here making this shit nigga Chris Paul

[Hook: I Love Makonnen]
Out here in the streets trynna make some more dough
If I ain't in the streets, then I'm in the studio
So I'm out here in the streets trynna make some more dough
If I ain't in the streets, then I'm in the studio
And when I'm in the streets, you know I'm dodgin 12
Because me and my friends don't go to jail
When I'm in the streets, you know I'm dodgin 12
Because me and my friends don't go to jail

[Bridge: I Love Makonnen]
Out here got a new one
Soldado

[Verse 2: I Love Makonnen]
Out here with these packs fucking swervin on the west side
Niggas like me, out here flying in the best ride
Gas with some purp, I don't sell no fucking molly ho
I can find them shrooms and it probably go for higher though
Ayy on that hydro, nigga Mr. Nice Guy
I be smoking all type of weed they be flying in
On Air Tran or whatever fucking airline
Bet my fucking friend is gonna bring that shit in tonight

[Hook: I Love Makonnen]
Out here in the streets trynna make some more dough
If I ain't in the streets, then I'm in the studio
So I'm out here in the streets trynna make some more dough
If I ain't in the streets, then I'm in the studio
And when I'm in the streets, you know I'm dodgin 12
Because me and my friends don't go to jail
When I'm in the streets, you know I'm dodgin 12
Because me and my friends don't go to jail


[Bridge: I Love Makonnen]
Me and my friends don't go to jail
Soldado

[Hook: I Love Makonnen]
Out here in the streets trynna make some more dough
If I ain't in the streets, then I'm in the studio
So I'm out here in the streets trynna make some more dough
If I ain't in the streets, then I'm in the studio
And when I'm in the streets, you know I'm dodgin 12
Because me and my friends don't go to jail
When I'm in the streets, you know I'm dodgin 12
Because me and my friends don't go to jail
