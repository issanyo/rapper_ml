[Intro: iLoveMakonnen and Lil Peep]
-as it's falling down
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down, yeah
Ko, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
Ko, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
(yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Ko, let's watch the rain as it's falling down (as it's falling down)
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around (I'm not around, yeah)
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town (you're out of town)
So Ko, let's watch the rain as it's falling down (it's falling down, yeah)

[Bridge: iLoveMakonnen]
Where I wanna be again and again
Alone, you and me, skin to skin
Where I wanna be again and again
Alone, you and me, skin to skin

[Verse 1: iLoveMakonnen]
Why don't we talk the way we should?
You should hug me lately
I just wanna be the one, uh
That you always callin', ba-a-by

[Chorus: Lil Peep and iLoveMakonnen]
Ko, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
(as it's falling, as it's falling down)
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
(when I'm not a-, when I'm not around)
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
(out of town, feeling the same)
Ko, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
(yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Peep and iLoveMakonnen]
Ko, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
(as it's falling down)
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
(when I'm not a-, when I'm not around)
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
(you're out of, you're out of town)
So Ko, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
(as it's falling down)

[Bridge: iLoveMakonnen]
Where I wanna be again and again
Alone, you and me, just skin to skin
Where I wanna be again and again
Alone, you and me, skin to skin

[Verse 2: iLoveMakonnen]
Why don't we talk the way we should?
You should hug me at ni-i-ight
Why you walking 'way from us?
When I'm your only gu-u-uy

[Chrous: Lil Peep and iLoveMakonnen]
Ko, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
(as it's falling, as it's falling down)
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
(when I'm not a-, when I'm not a-)
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
(you're out of to-o-own, yeah)
Ko, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
(as it's falling)
(yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Peep and iLoveMakonnen]
Ko, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
(as it's falling, as it's falling down)
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
(when I'm not around)
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
(when you're out of town)
So Ko, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
(as it's falling down)
