[Intro]
Yeah, uhhh, yeah, ooooh, yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
I just, think about all my past times
Get on these fuckin' tracks and make these words rhyme
I don't even sell no dimes, cause I do not have no time
But I used to reminisce when me and my homies was on the grind
All the time, tryna shine cause we need them new things
Now a boy got pinky rings, switching lanes with 6 chains
I don't even give a fuck, used to have a black truck
All the way in zip codes that I do not go no mo
Oh shit, I got shows every motherfuckin' weekend
Me and my best friends ain't fuckin' speakin'
Got friends from down under arrivin' in the morning
Tell 'em that Makonnen is the best thing goin
Worldwide, now you know it, finally I can show it
Young boy in the city lookin' like I'm fuckin' growin'
All the way with the moon, ocean sun when it be snowin'
I don't know how I got it, I'm so thankful for the flowin'
My friends, once again, when they come back around
I remember all night, we was sellin' that brown
To some motherfuckin' junkies, I was actin' like a monkey
Swingin' off them god damn trees
Makin' hunnid of them things
All damn night with the white, now a nigga barely see
Any type of fuckin' drugs, who the fuck is me?
I just once was a young boy, on the fuckin' corner
Sellin' all this dope from Atlanta to California
And now I brought it back all the way to the West
Cuz them niggas in the East said that I was one of the best
So I'm like, let me go, see if the rumors true
When I step off in the room, niggas be mad at who?
When I step in studios, niggas tryna sound like who, now
God damn, I ride around in black fuckin' coupes now
Don't even need to pick it up

[Verse 2]
I think my life is a joke
I might be on too many drugs
I lost so many friends
I don't know who to hug
I wonder why I try
I swear my friends are on dope
All them looking for drugs
All they really wanna do is get high
I wonder why, do I try?
Yeah I think my life is a joke, sometimes
I think my life is a joke, sometimes
The cruel ones played on me
Since I was so young
I used to want to run away to somewhere fun
Well I could hide
I need you inside
I remember bein' alone
All those nights, I used to want to run away
To somewhere bright
And smile
And feel alright, yeah
I've been through so much pain
It helped me gain a lot
I wonder if I enjoyed a sunday if it rained alot
I cry, yeah
Thinkin' bout my past times
So many I wanted to be here right with me
They had to leave, unexpectedly
And I try to be there for them
