[Intro]:
Baby keep it on the low
Can you keep it on the low?
Don't let nobody know
Baby keep it on the low
Can you keep it on the low?
Baby keep it on the low
Don't let nobody know
Baby keep it on the low

[Verse 1:]
Now lately you've been talking
About the way we creep
And lately Ive been stalking
You and your tweets
Wonderin if youre talking bout us
To your little friends
If you the reason why
This girl is all in my 'mages

[Hook:]
Can you keep it low?
Baby keep it low
Don't let nobody know
Like baby keep it low
Like baby keep it low
Tell me can you keep it low?
Don't let nobody know
Like baby keep it low

[Verse 2:]
I try to see ya on a Sunday
After work
But
You pretty busy from Saturday
Wit ya girls
Now I can understand that
Cuz I'm not really your man
But
Im trying to take you back
And have you in my bed

[Outro:]
So baby keep it low
Can you keep it on the low?
Don't let nobody know
Baby keep it on the low
Can you keep it on the low
Baby keep it on the low
Don't let nobody know
Baby keep it on the low
