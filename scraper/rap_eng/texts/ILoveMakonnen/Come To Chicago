[Intro] x4
If I see you tomorrow I'll try to say goodbye
If I don't then I won't

[Verse]
I don't want to play your foolish game of love
Cause love has been a losing game for us
If you didn't need me like that
Then why'd you ever come back?
If you didn't want me like that
Then why do you get so mad?

[Pre-Chorus]
If I see you tomorrow I'll say goodbye
If I don't then i guess that i won't

[Chorus] x4
If you come to Chicago I guess I will see you there
Somewhere

[Refrain] x8
You're there and I'm here
And it's weird, and it's clear

[Chorus]
If you come to Chicago I guess I will see you again
Somewhere
If I see you tomorrow I guess I will say goodbye
If I can

[Outro]
If I see you tomorrow then I'll say goodbye
If I don't then I guess that I won't
