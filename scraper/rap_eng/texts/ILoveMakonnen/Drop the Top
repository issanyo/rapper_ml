[Chorus: Teddy]
I drop the top, she see the sky
She got two hands up in my ride
I pop a Perc', I'm in the sky
Smokin' Krispy Kreme, it keeps me in the high
Cartier frames, lookin' at this life, it look so fine
I drop the top, she see the sky
She got two hands up in my ride
I pop a Perc', I'm in the sky
Smokin' Krispy Kreme, it keeps me in the high
Cartier frames, lookin' at this life, it look so fine

[Verse 1: Teddy]
Got a bitch like Kylie Jenner, keep her 'round like all the time
Might just take her overseas just to come and waste some time
She pourin' Cristal in the hotel room, she lookin' really fine
Natalist, my wrist is lookin' ice (so icy)
Yeah, and I just pimped out my ride
Hotboxed it at the dealership, you know we whippin' right
Right, yeah she told me live my life (live my life)
So I told her live it twice (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Panties off in the ride
Poured a 4 up in the cup and catch a vibe (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, and she say she wanna get high (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Take a pit stop at the big shop, let's get right

[Chorus: Teddy]
I drop the top, she see the sky
She got two hands up in my ride
I pop a Perc', I'm in the sky
Smokin' Krispy Kreme, it keeps me in the high
Cartier frames, lookin' at this life, it look so fine
I drop the top, she see the sky
She got two hands up in my ride
I pop a Perc', I'm in the sky
Smokin' Krispy Kreme, it keeps me in the high
Cartier frames, lookin' at this life, it look so fine

[Verse 2: iLoveMakonnen]
Yeah, that gas got me in a daze
Ayy, I stay always in the waves
Yeah, you know I'm best thing goin'
I'm lookin' like the ocean, we out here steady flowin', yeah
You know that water help us grow and, yeah
If you ain't know then now you knowin', yeah
They say I'm evil like an omen
I tell 'em, "oh, man," I keep the white like a snowman, yeah
I drop the top and see the sky, sky, sky
You know I'm out here ridin' high, high, high
Baby, tell me if you're down, down, down
And maybe I can come around, 'round, 'round

[Chorus: Teddy]
I drop the top, she see the sky
She got two hands up in my ride
I pop a Perc', I'm in the sky
Smokin' Krispy Kreme, it keeps me in the high
Cartier frames, lookin' at this life, it look so fine
I drop the top, she see the sky
She got two hands up in my ride
I pop a Perc', I'm in the sky
Smokin' Krispy Kreme, it keeps me in the high
Cartier frames, lookin' at this life, it look so fine
