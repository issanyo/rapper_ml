[Verse 1: ILoveMakonnen]
My money I fold up, bitches be pulling
See me in this city, boy I look like wool in
Sheeps in clothing, boy us niggas be wolfin'
Out here off that molly, boy, these bitches be tweakin'
Barely speaking to my old plug now
That nigga hit me with so much I ain't seen him in a while
Cause this shit been moving, boy, my stocks is goddamn loaded up
I tell that nigga, come and pull on me, I'm loaded up

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]

He was hard on the internet, now that nigga hoeing up
Nigga what's up? I'm loaded up
I'm glow'd up, I'm countin' cash, add it up, add it up
I pulled up these niggas weren't ready
Give me a yam I'mma cop the red wraith, pull up with a gold machete
My brother kept the Pendergrass like his first name was Teddy
Down south, young nigga pulled up in an all grey box Chevy
Woah, fetti, I'm Fetty, like I'm Carti, came to fuck up the party

[Verse 3: Skippa Da Flippa]
Mazi heavy tonka trucks
Skippa da Flippa stack mega bucks
All types of clips, only guns I trust
And I came up off chopping, not touching bust
Old school the Nova, I had the dreams of having a sofa
Now I have chauffeurs
Load the whole clip up, I shoot fast like hiccups
Banana clip drunken, I shoot 'til it's over
Cookie roll it, chopper loaded
I am the shooter, I don't have to show it
Copped me a two-piece today and I'll blow it
Come on this boat get stretched out like aerobics
Me and Makonnen, ten pair of Rick Owens
Shoot the UZI, roll the cookie, make sure that it's blowing
Cocaine party, you would think it was snowing
We have hella artillery, I know you knowing
(Flippa)
