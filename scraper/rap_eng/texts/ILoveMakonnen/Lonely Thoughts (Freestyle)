[Intro: iLoveMakonnen]
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen]
Sometimes I wanna cry, I have no more tears
Sometimes I wanna die, but then I wanna live
This is how I feel when I'm all alone
When I'm all alone, the thoughts when I'm lonely
The thoughts when I'm lonely
The thoughts when I'm lonely (yeah)
The thoughts when I'm lonely (yeah)

[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen]
Sometimes I wanna cry, I have no more tears
Sometimes I wanna die, but then I wanna live
This is how I feel when I'm all alone
When I'm all alone
The thoughts when I'm lonely
The thoughts when I'm lonely
The thoughts when I'm lonely (the thoughts when I'm lonely)
The thoughts when I'm lonely (the thoughts when I'm lonely)

[Verse: Teddy]
Yeah, baby, I've been missing you (missing you)
I've been missing you calling on my phone late night (yeah, what)
I swear you got the mighty touch or the mighty white (what, yeah)
Swear I miss my wife (miss my wife)
Now my new team iced out (iced out)
Bitch, my ex bitch lucked up (lucked up)
But I still feel lonely (lonely)
Ain't got homies
Hollywood dreaming 'bout my ex bitch like the old me

[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen]
Sometimes I wanna cry, I have no more tears
Sometimes I wanna die, but then I wanna live
This is how I feel when I'm all alone
When I'm all alone
The thoughts when I'm lonely
The thoughts when I'm lonely
The thoughts when I'm lonely
The thoughts when I'm lonely

[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen]
Sometimes I wanna cry, I have no more tears
Sometimes I wanna die, but then I wanna live
This is how I feel when I'm all alone
When I'm in my home
My thoughts when I'm lonely
My thoughts when I'm lonely
My thoughts when I'm lonely

[Outro: iLoveMakonnen]
