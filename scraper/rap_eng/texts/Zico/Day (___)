[Verse 1: Zico]
I will spit on ya like a king cobra
Beat it playboys I have phobia of bums
I swallow growing sprouts like health foods
Started from an unknown nobody
But made it to the top as quick as an arrow
The song you’re featuring in
Went to you after I turned it down
My little bro Bobby, listen up
Beyond the mountains are more mountains
The times change and the music industry
Is divided between others and Z
I  move between major and minor
My chord is right wherever
What’re you giving me a horoscope for
I’m a star, rose to the top a long time ago
Rise of the legend
I’m warning you
If you talk bad about my fans, I’ll kill you

I work all night while babies are put to bed
I feel more refreshed by broken sleep
It’s more distressing to not admit it, going public with relationships
It’s actually unfair play when playing games
What’s my name?

[Hook: JTONG]
The inside of the viewers’ brains
Is engraved with my design
Deadly appeal exuding strong identity
The law of the jungle
Awaken dormant instincts
You won’t be able to hold it in
Without pissing all over your lower body
We two predators are in our own zones
On top of the food chain
With razor-like claws raking up and swallowing our opponents
Your sly ways in this field of hip hop
I’ll tear it up and grind grind grind

[Verse 2: Zico]
Please don’t force properness
I need to ride a crooked road to be eloquent
Problem child
Hey little flower blossoms
Quit if you’re scared of blood
Don’t dig into other people’s past
Live creatively instead
Beads of sweat fall from my tongue to make a dance
You hesitantly make awkward metaphors
Your poor choice in words screws up the groove
So what you gon’ do
The rate of my business is gravity-free
It won’t fall, it’s always open year-round
Open parenthesis and underline, I’m the person of these times
A guy like Woo Jiho is unprecedented
I’m abnormal l so I always comeback during war
Some people rush their timing to rob an empty house cause they’re scared
A piece of trash with an empty shell
Your break-even point is an unsurmountable wall like me

Feel me it’s real me
Bachelors, stop talking people’s ears off, sex appeal
How dare you defy me, raise up the white flag
Little kids go cover up and hide yourselves
What’s my name

[Hook: JTONG]
The inside of the viewers’ brains
Is engraved with my design
Deadly appeal exuding strong identity
The law of the jungle
Awaken dormant instincts
You won’t be able to hold it in
Without pissing all over your lower body
We two predators are in our own zones
On top of the food chain
With razor-like claws raking up and swallowing our opponents
Your sly ways in this field of hip hop
I’ll tear it up and grind grind grind

[Verse 3: Zico]
Yo, yo
When I be on the mic
Everyone below me
Listen up
Let’s not take Zico’s words lightly today
Those who wish I were dead
I’ve made the insults you throw at me
Into a long-lasting fortune
I have eternal life
Would I make all this fuss just to become king
What you talkin’ about
My last name Woo means king, you little shit
The day is written right there in my sentence
Like my album quality, I’ll kill your career
