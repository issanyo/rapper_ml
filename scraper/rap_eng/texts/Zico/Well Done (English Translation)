[ZICO]
I only chased my dreams as if I was about to die
The finish line is nowhere in sight, since I'm never satisfied
It's the hard knock life, I'm still the type that
Prefers to live a tight life than an easy one, huh
One by one, producers copy my character
But ZICO grew on experience not practice
4 years of vicissitudes, ill luck and family affairs
Even breathing feels like smoking, can you understand how that feels?
Get over it and move on, I got over it all with my eyes wide open
To hold on to my family and to lead my friends
I've got the swank of no other man
My spending is more like a reward than extravagance
Letters look blurred if you look at them up close
Likewise, you do not know what fix you are in
In an inner city where everything is solved by a button
I do it on my own and my efforts pay off, Well done



[Chorus]
I’m doing it right
Even this much is superb
Only the Strong Survive
Nothing to be ashamed of, dude
Although I'm not mature yet, althought I'm not mature yet
Uh uh I make my mama proud
Although I'm not mature yet, althought I'm not mature yet
Go ahead you can't ignore it now

In 2008, when Lee Hyori's U-Go-Girl was
Topping the charts, Kim Sunghee started standing on his own
Vacuum machines, washing dishes, making money, not a single thing
Was familiar when I started "surviving here in Seoul" project still a battlefield, fight without a knife
The method I learned to grasp all this: 1 dynamic mic
Petty thoughts accumulate inside my head, My friends who have
Worn Georgettes will understand, It's the hard knock life
And time flies, faster than your dad's car
What I inherited isn't a car key but the height 180
Eyesight 1.5 observation skills exceed others
Open minded expressions, like the Little Prince's box
Guess what's inside? Money, fame, and bitches
I wanted to know, too, so I came all the way
Here to where I am now, Polo on, come through the door
A triumphant general, let me hear cheers of victory when I pass Dongdaemun
And the drumroll and a round of applause too
I say to myself looking at the mirror backstage
All of this is not a dream, I will continue to
Go forward but first of all, great job, Well done



[Chorus]



("All this stuff that makes me move just feels like a dream.")



[ZICO]
Even on the accounting day I write songs
Go to Seocho and bother Pop Time stay tuned
Success gives me a sense of duty with no time for excitement
The boisterous empty wagons come with empty hands and go with empty hands
Be positive, like what Osteen quoted, the power of positivity
The lower consonant is wrong, it's actually the power of money
I learned the theory of power early, the sight of you living like a machine
Is nowhere humane, why do you keep talking about my character?
I've cleared my family's debts, look at
My grandmother's house in Ilsan, my uncle's gone but
'god save Paulus' Mom's portrait
On my chest, if you want to look at me properly, put the cameras down
I make words become reality! before rebuking others
I strive to make the impossible become true if not turn famous and rich
They say if passion becomes excessive, it becomes harm
That's right, I make you sweat and fan yourselves



[Chorus]
