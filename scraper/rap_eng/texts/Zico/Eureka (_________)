[Intro: Zico]
Z-Z-ZICO
Z Z-ZION.T

[Hook: Zion.T]
I wanna touch you big booty girl
The exclamation mark in my trousers
It’s impatient, so I’m chasing you
Where you at, Where you at, Where you at

[Refrain: Zico]
Eureka!
See that?

[Verse 1: Zico]
Oh god she’s hot, you fit in my eyes
A girl with a perfect body
Up and down it’s so tight that 3D body I’m totally obsessed
Call the fire truck
You are always a hot potato, your body
You are doing nothing but your body’s showing off yourself
It’s too amazing just to be looked at a
Erotic girl gives me a sudden inspiration
Erotic imagination, how good is it?

[Hook: Zion.T]
I wanna touch you big booty girl
The exclamation mark in my trousers
It’s impatient, so I’m chasing you
Where you at, Where you at, Where you at

[Refrain: Zico]
Eureka!
See that?


[Verse 2: Zico]
’19 and over’ sticker can’t hide you
I can’t be a gentle man tonight
I want to bungee jump to your soft pillows
The day time’s so red without alcohol
This is realism without any exaggeration
I know the expressions could be vulgar
But look at yourself
I’m not a gentleman
You don’t feel guilty
To have such a body?
My bottoms got angry

[Chorus: Zion.T]
I want to touch you big booty girl
The exclamation mark in my trousers
It’s impatient, so I’m chasing you
Where you at, Where you at, Where you at

[Refrain: Zico]
Eureka!
See that?

[Post-hook: Zico]
So sexy, eureka, awesome, a perfect body rate
You’ve got your personal magnetism
I realized that you are so beautiful
And I said Eureka

[Bridge: Zico/Zion.T]
Sexy, can you be my new wife
Soulless fashion people stop flirting
I wanna ask you, how did you get that?
A full apple hip, I wanna be Steve Jobs all day
I want to take you to my passenger seat
I’m a handsome, healthy and rich youngster
Monday to Sunday, stay with you sexy
One night no even the next day uh

[Refrain: Zico]
Eureka!
See that?

[Post-hook: Zico]
So sexy, eureka, awesome, a perfect body rate
You’ve got your personal magnetism
I realized that you are so beautiful
And I said Eureka
