[Hook]
We are we are we artist baby
We are we are we artist ZICO

[Verse 1]
I have a good feeling, just thought of an idea
I live my weekends like it’s the weekday
So I’m gonna get an award, alright
My schedule was jam packed again this year
They all recognize me when I go out
Fanxy child is freakin hot
But still, I'm lonely
What should I do

People who are about to die of boredom
People who can never be high class
People who scratch and get bumps
People who are gonna kill it, oh yes
How much longer are your heads gonna be noisy?
If you have deep knowledge on art
Let’s draw something

[Pre-Chorus]
From now on
Turn every back to a blank canvas
Don’t think, just do, you’re holding the brush
You have the most sense when you’re in front of the mirror
Life is short Art is long
You or me or him, I make em say

[Hook]
Ah We are we artist baby
We are we are we artist baby
We are we are we artist baby
Hey Life is short Art is long
You or me or him, I make’em say

[Verse 2]
Let me think about it
What exactly am I gonna earn
By making this song all day?
When can I maintain my dignity if I work all the time?
If there’s traffic, go the other way
Press down your cap, put your shoes on half way
Breathe in the outside air and look around
No one can judge you
I design my own life, get up

Relax or else you’ll hurt your neck
Let go of things you can’t grasp
Don’t take keep the old colors
Hum like you do in the shower, like whoo yes
I won’t age, I’ll just spit the years out
If my words are persuasive
Make some noise

[Pre-Chorus]
From now on
Turn every back to a blank canvas
Don’t think, just do, you’re holding the brush
You have the most sense when you’re in front of the mirror
Life is short Art is long
You or me or him, I make em say

[Hook]
Ah We are we artist baby
We are we are we artist baby
We are we are we artist baby
Hey Life is short Art is long
You or me or him, I make’em say

[Bridge]
Don’t push back fun, it’s impossible to save it up
If somebody say, maybe when I grow up
That grown up time is now
If the world ends tomorrow
Answer me what you gon' do
Asking about the edge of happiness is prohibited

[Pre-Chorus]
Now on
Turn every back to a blank canvas
Don’t think, just do, you’re holding the brush
You have the most sense when you’re in front of the mirror
Life is short Art is long
You or me or him, I make em say

[Hook]
Are are are are artist baby
We are are are are artist baby
Are are are are artist baby

One more time
Life is short Art is long
You or me or him, I make’em say

Hangul

[Hook]
We are we are we artist baby
We are we are we artist ZICO

[Verse 1]
뭔가 예감 좋아 번뜩 악상이 떠올라
금토일도 월요일같이 사는 내게
상 줄 거야 Alright
올해도 스케줄 꽉 찼고
길 가면 다 알아보고
Fanxy child 겁나 핫하고
그런데도 나 외로워
What should I do

지루해 죽기 직전인 사람
절대 양반은 못 되는 사람
굳이 긁어 부스럼 만드는 사람
아주 박살을 내버릴 사람들 Oh yes
언제까지 머릿속만 시끄러울래
예술에 조예가 깊다면
Let’s draw something

[Pre-Chorus]
From now on
모든 것을 백지로 되돌려 놓고
생각 말고 저질러
붓은 너가 쥐고 있어
제일 감각 있잖아
자기 집 거울 앞에선 yeah
Life is short Art is long
너나 나나 쟤나 I make’em say

[Hook]
Ah We are we artist baby
We are we are we artist baby
We are we are we artist baby
Hey Life is short Art is long
너나 나나 쟤나 I make’em say

[Verse 2]
Let me think about it 도대체 뭘
얻고자 온종일 노랠 만들었을까
일하고 품위 유진 언제 해
막히면 저 반대 길로 역주행 해
모자 눌러 써 신발 구겨 신어
바깥 공기 마시며 세상 구경 좀 해
남이 재단할 수 없어
내 인생은 내가 디자인해 Get up

시선 빼 그러다 목에 담 와
손에 잡히지 않는 건 다 놔
구색 따윈 갖추지 말자
흥얼대 혼자 샤워할 때처럼
Like whoo yes
난 나이를 먹지 않고 도로 뱉을 건데
내 말이 설득력 있다면
Make some noise

[Pre-Chorus]
From now on
모든 것을 백지로 되돌려 놓고
생각 말고 저질러
붓은 너가 쥐고 있어
제일 감각 있잖아
자기 집 거울 앞에선 yeah
Life is short Art is long
너나 나나 쟤나 I make’em say

[Hook]
Ah We are we artist baby
We are we are we artist baby
We are we are we artist baby
Hey Life is short Art is long
너나 나나 쟤나 I make’em say

[Bridge]
미루지 마 즐거움을
그건 저축이 불가능
Somebody say 이 다음에 커서
그 커서가 바로 지금
내일 지구가 멸망하면
Answer me what you gon do
행복의 언저리에서 고민은 금물

[Pre-Chorus]
Now on
모든 것을 백지로 되돌려 놓고
생각 말고 저질러
붓은 너가 쥐고 있어
제일 감각 있잖아
자기 집 거울 앞에선 yeah
Life is short Art is long
너나 나나 쟤나 I make’em say

[Hook]
Are are are are artist baby
We are are are are artist baby
Are are are are artist baby

One more time
Life is short Art is long
너나 나나 쟤나 I make’em say
