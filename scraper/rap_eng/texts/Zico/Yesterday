Korean Original

[Hook: Kyung]
너 아닌 척하지마
눈에 보이지만
넘어가는 걸
What did you do yesterday
곰인 척하지마
여우인 걸 알지만
넘어가는 걸
What did you do yesterday
What did you do yesterday
What did you do do do

[Verse 1: U-Kwon & Jaehyo]
일찍 잔다는 너
요새 피곤하다며
열한 시간 동안 잠수더니
또 피곤하대
무심코 내려놓은 듯한 폰은
오늘도 덮어놓고는
내가 예민하대

[Verse 2: ZICO]
어디까지가 진실 어디까지가
거짓인지 어디 설명해봐
넌 얼굴색 하나 안 변하고
육하원칙으로 반론해
언제나 쏘아붙이면 대활 거부해
팩트를 들이대면 모르쇠
Yesterday all my trouble
Came close to me
또 나만 호구된 청문회

[Hook: P.O]
너 아닌 척하지마
눈에 보이지만
넘어가는 걸
What did you do yesterday
곰인 척하지마
여우인 걸 알지만
넘어가는 걸
What did you do yesterday

[Verse 3: U-Kwon & Jaehyo]
넌 너가 예쁜 걸 알아서 문제야
No no no no
은근슬쩍 시선 즐기는 너
불안하게 왜 그래
No no no no

[Verse 5: P.O]
프로필 사진은 왜 바꾼 거야
옷은 왜 어제랑 똑같은 거야
일부러 싫증 유발하는 거야
끝장내고 싶은 거야 뭐야
I don’t know why I love you
심증뿐인 추궁은 본전도 못 건졌네
넌 내 머리 위 난 네 발 밑
아쉬운 쪽이 손해 보는 싸움이지

[Hook: ZICO]
너 아닌 척하지마
눈에 보이지만
넘어가는 걸
What did you do yesterday
곰인 척하지마
여우인 걸 알지만
넘어가는 걸
What did you do yesterday

[Verse 6: Kyung]
라리라라라 라라라라라
돌고 도는 패턴이지만
라리라라라 라라라라라
넘어가는 걸
What did you do yesterday

[Bridge: b-bomb & P.O]
알면서도 속아주는 거야
그만큼 널 좋아하는 거야
다만 들키지만 말아줘
그럼 다 눈감아줄게
뭐든지 해줄게

[Hook: Taeil]
너 아닌 척하지마
눈에 보이지만
넘어가는 걸
What did you do yesterday
곰인 척하지마
여우인 걸 알지만
넘어가는 걸
What did you do yesterday

[Outro: Kyung]
라리라라라 라라라라라
돌고 도는 패턴이지만
라리라라라 라라라라라
넘어가는 걸
What did you do yesterday

English Translation

[Hook: Kyung]
Stop pretending
I can see it with my eyes
But I let it go
What did you do yesterday
Don't pretend to be a bear
I know you’re a fox
But I let it go
What did you do yesterday
What did you do yesterday
What did you do do do do

[Verse 1: U-Kwon & Jaehyo]
You said you’re going to bed early
You said you’re tired these days
And you didn’t answer for 11 hours
But you said you’re tired again
A phone that seems to be placed casually
But it's upside down today as well
You tell me I'm sensitive

[Verse 2: ZICO]
Until where does the truth go?
Explain it to me
Without the slightest change of expression
You make a counterargument with who what when why
If I argue back, you refuse to talk
When I say the truth, you pretend you know nothing
When I give you facts, you act dumb
Yesterday all my trouble
Came close to me
This is a hearing where I’ve become the pushover again

[Hook: P.O]
Stop pretending
I can see it with my eyes
But I let it go
What did you do yesterday
Don't pretend to be a bear
I know you’re a fox
But I let it go
What did you do yesterday

[Verse 3: U-Kwon & Jaehyo]
You know how pretty you are
That's your problem
No no no no
You enjoy the stares
Why do you make me nervous
No no no no

[Verse 5: P.O]
Why did you change your profile picture
Why are your clothes the same from yesterday
Are you trying to make me get sick of you
Are you trying to end this or what
I don't know why I love you
All I have are soft evidences
I suffered a total loss in my accusations
You are on top of my head and I am below your feet
This is a fight where the one who’s sorry is the one who loses

[Hook: ZICO]
Stop pretending
I can see it with my eyes
But I let it go
What did you do yesterday
Don't pretend to be a bear
I know you’re a fox
But I let it go
What did you do yesterday

[Verse 6: Kyung]
Lalilalala Lalalalala
It’s a repeating pattern
Lalilalala Lalalalala
So I said nothing
What did you do yesterday

[Bridge: b-bomb & P.O]
I know everything, but say nothing
I love you that much
Just don’t get caught
Then I’ll say nothing
I’ll do anything for you

[Hook: Taeil]
Stop pretending
I can see it with my eyes
But I let it go
What did you do yesterday
Don't pretend to be a bear
I know you’re a fox
But I let it go
What did you do yesterday

[Outro: Kyung]
Lalilalala Lalalalala
It’s a repeating pattern
Lalilalala Lalalalala
So I said nothing
What did you do yesterday
