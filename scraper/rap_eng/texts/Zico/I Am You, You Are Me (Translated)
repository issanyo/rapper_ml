[Intro]
You are me, I am you
I am you, you are me
If our hearts are the same
Us two become each other
You are me I am you
We make a pretty picture
Who came up with the word “cringe”

[Verse 1]
Girl slap me once, in the last few days
Something happened to me
I deleted my ex’s number
I only ever listened to hip hop
Now I’ve turned acoustic

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what you want from me
We’re at the age we look the most beautiful
So we need to love to the fullest eh
That trash who’s from your past
I will be incomparably
Better to you because

[Chorus]
You are me, I am you
I am you, you are me
If our hearts are the same
Two will become each other
You are me I am you
We make a pretty picture
Who came up with the word “cringe”

[Verse 2]
Our friends say it’s the honeymoon phase
I don’t have any worries actually
It’s a problem I don’t have a care in the world
Look I don’t swear as much anymore
I pull up my pants now
I don’t let my smile show at anyone
Stop looking at the mirror there’s nothing that needs fixing
You are the prettiest when you don’t have makeup on
If my mom sees us
She will probably faint
I’ll save on expressions
Cus really all I had to do was write down your name

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe in destiny
Horoscopes or tarot cards
I don’t do relationships based in the stars yeah
Your obsessive ex-boyfriend
I won’t let him dare come near your house
I will be good to you why
Because

[Chorus]
You are me, I am you
I am you, you are me
If our hearts are the same
Two will become each other
You are me I am you
We make a pretty picture
Who came up with the word “cringe”

[Refrain]
All night long we kiss each other and
Together all shabbily
We wake up in the morning (good morning)
Suddenly you’re seriously so pretty
Bring me your lips Mwah!

[Chorus]
You are me, I am you
I am you, you are me
If our hearts are the same
Two will become each other
(Yah, yah, yah)
You are me I am you
We make a pretty picture
Who came up with the word “cringe”

[Outro]
Let me talk to you (yeah)
I am you, you are me
I am you, you are me
