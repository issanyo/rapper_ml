[Verse 1: Mino]
When I was young
More than I am now, when I was around 11 years old
I heard 50 Cent’s music and my ears opened
I recorded my first project, I advanced without fear
And I rebelled when my direction changed
My heart that didn’t compromise cracks
Money isn’t everything but
I didn’t have anything to spare so I did everything
Now I’m here to find myself which I have lost
I don’t have time to talk to you
I need paper
In the time you have to swear at me, take care of your family

[Pre-hook: Zico]
Uh Get your hands up high like
Uh even if we fall, we sky dive
Uh artists can’t act their age
Growing up is heavy, punk

Everyone came here to earn money
Everyone came here to become famous
All rappers wanna be like Jigga Nas Biggie Pac
Crazies are screaming loudly now

[Hook: Paloalto]
Get out of my way eh oh
Don’t point fingers eh oh
You’re the same eh oh
Don’t act differently alone

[Hook: Mino]
If you’re going to fake it then first
Do do do your own shit
Move to move

[Verse 2: Paloalto]
As usual rhyme and flow, I rock’n roll
I live like this, even though it’s exhausting at times
I have to earn more money
I’m grown up now
B*stards who take my time are all bad guys
How unsightly, just for hip hop
Why so obsessed? You’re just you
I just want to continue living my life
Y’all just leave with your scripts

[Pre-hook: Zico]
Uh Get your hands up high like
Uh even if we fall, we sky dive
Uh artists can’t act their age
Growing up is heavy, punk

Everyone came here to earn money
Everyone came here to become famous
All rappers wanna be like Jigga Nas Biggie Pac
Crazies are screaming loudly now

[Hook: Paloalto]
Get out of my way eh oh
Don’t point fingers eh oh
You’re the same eh oh
Don’t act differently alone

[Hook: Mino]
If you’re going to fake it then first
Do do do your own shit
Move to move

[Verse 3: Mino]
I want so many things so my head spins and spins
I’m always trapped cuz I’m in TV
So it can’t be avoided, each other’s team kills
Blood splatters here, you know, right?
Be relaxed only on stage
Blaming and sighing is ugly, Get up and grab something
It’s a waste, do your best, Do all you can
If you want to be on top, jump
Why are you sitting your ass down

[Hook: Paloalto]
Get out of my way eh oh
Don’t point fingers eh oh
You’re the same eh oh
Don’t act differently alone

[Hook: Mino]
If you’re going to fake it then first
Do do do your own shit
Move to move
