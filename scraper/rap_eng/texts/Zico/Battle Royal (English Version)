My eyes are open before the day breaks
Stuff in chicken breast, lettuce into my mouth
Dash out to Han River, run a marathon
Anemia value rises, feeling sharp pains
Can't finish, time to be exempt, pushup several times
I can just eat at an unwelcome place then throw up
I tighten my belt, fuck I gained a bit
Mr.Representative wants it, a body like a cola bottle
There are no allies, they say colleagues will soon be enemies
Blood-like sweat became horrific traces
When I can't bear the practice room, I go to the bathroom
I secretly sob, pulling it together as quickly as possible
First priority is appearance
Eventually a wholesome face goes under the knife
A systematic production of human weapons
Music bullshit? They wanna be famous, aight?~
Because I said "let's become a star, I'm on the verge of insanity
I become a prey on my own, stirring the spoon
Battle royal, a profession where I must survive
If you waver you're disqualified, move, it just begun

Murderous looks keeping each other in check
When I turned around after running for a long time
I had lost my innocence and became a villain
No one will ever forgive me
I will survive as I live
I must survive until the end
Yeah~

The sound of shouting fills the hall
The hand gesture that forces more stimulation
A layer is taken off, fully gesturing erotically
Even though it looks beautiful, the inside is mangled from rotting
I successfully endured with a sober mind
One person pours tears, saying it's now too much
This reality tangled with lies and impossible insistence
I'm scared to face it
Brightly colored balloons, plank card slogans
Take those out then everything else is criticism or resentment
No one knows, the saint becomes the right path
A chance to talk without being cursed at is given
Parents who boast about their precious daughter
The dust that enters their mind, their eyes
Engulfed in the feeling of betrayal, they shake their heads
Did they achieve their dream or lost it?

Murderous looks keeping each other in check
When I turned around after running for a long time
I had lost my innocence and became a villain
No one will ever forgive me
I will survive as I live
I must survive until the end
Yeah~
