[Verse 1: Zico]
Since I’m thorough and cynical
Love is a very consumptive thing
Look at them hanging out like thieves
Lying to each other not to be hurt
In that bad condition, it’s very hard. To be bold
When I was stepping backward from a trap called
Romance you bumped into me and that was over
That moment that I can never describe it with
Words or paintings – Calling you without reason
Joking with you with trivial jokes
Telling our story like it’s not ours
To my friends and be satisfied with friends’ reaction
There are many embarrassing things but
I can’t even understand myself and this is
What called love – Life is like this. Even though I want
Something desperately – I can’t have it easily

[Hook: Suran]
Pride and prejudice tell me what is more important
I was wrong ain’t nothing (but love)
People change as time goes by
They were never like this – It’s cruel but stay in your lane

[Verse 2: Zico]
Smile and practise how to speak nicely
So many coincidences that was planned
If you fall in love at first sight, even a realist
Becomes reckless to achieve it
The canvas that I tried to erase the painting is ruined
I’m always on the same page even though I open the
Book again – Your presence itself made a mark on my life
And I became a detective who’s tracing those
My life is a made-up fantasy
But before I knew, I was writing about my story
Without reading a book or a movie. I was scared
I was bad. Eventually we became nobody
Even though we used to be the closest
You put a period on me saying good bye
Which isn’t really what I wanted to say
I shouldn’t have loved you reticently
Sadness is overflowing even though I try to accept it

[Hook: Suran]
Pride and prejudice tell me what is more important
I was wrong ain’t nothing (but love)
People change as time goes by
They were never like this – It’s cruel but stay in your lane

[Bridge: Zico]
The chances that I missed
Because I said I was busy
An impulsive one night love
All of those were actually my pride

[Hook: Suran]
Pride and prejudice tell me what is more important
I was wrong ain’t nothing (but love)
People change as time goes by
They were never like this – It’s cruel but stay in your lane
