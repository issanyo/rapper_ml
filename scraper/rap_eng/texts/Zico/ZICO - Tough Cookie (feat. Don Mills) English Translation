[Verse 1: ZICO]
Hello to all the ignorant fools who still throw me nasty looks
Too bad for you but Block B swept all the charts
We were handed the trophy, without sajaegi, I made it
Performance contracts and featuring requests, I wasn’t sure how to reject them
I’m the top of idol rappers, fuck, I ain’t no snake’s head
My competition is elsewhere, nothing in the broadcast networks
J-Tong hyung, who was my hater, recruited me into Buckwilds
During the lawsuit I was contacted many times by big agencies
Honestly, I’m comfortable in a wild environment; to a company’s care, I say “No Thanks”
I’m always running, never satisfied, I’m totally gone, drunk man
I’ll make you wet your underwear, don’t try to stop me, ever
There’s no expiration date to my walk of life, in all eternity, I won’t ever rest
You confess that, "You have no glory days", why?
My flow is fierce, ha, the situation is over and dealt with
Draw attention, I’m clearing my name that was tarnished
While taking part in Hallyu I get looks of longing, what!

[Chorus]
I’m not your friend
And I’m not your family either
I’m not your peer
Chew me wrong and all your teeth might fall out
Cause I'm a TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE
TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE
Cause I'm a TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE
Chew me wrong and all your teeth might fall out

[Verse 2: Don Mills]
Friends, are you listening? Yeah I made it
I did what I had to do so in the end, I made it
In the past, I got fired in just one day or worked without pay for months
All the bosses, are you listening? Yeah I made it
If you write it, the lyrics are like dog shit but when I write it, it overflows with character
You put on a mask and you put in energy, I overflow with power and you’re just a gimmick
You can put a lot of effort into it and release it but they just go on to the next track
You fool, you pretend to be strong but you’re just weak
Don Mills, hating me, saying that I’m networking to do hip-hop
Don Mills, started in Korea without a single connection
Don Mills, I do my own PR for my own song
Don Mills, I spread my own name
Time is gold, you can’t waste it
I release an album and now a strong featuring
Finally, I hear my name from here and there
What’s my name that is heard from here and there? Don Mills!

[Chorus]
I’m not your friend
And I’m not your family either
I’m not your peer
Chew me wrong and all your teeth might fall out
Cause I'm a TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE
TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE
Cause I'm a TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE
Chew me wrong and all your teeth might fall out

[Verse 3: ZICO]
Before a Music Core MC, I’m just an MC
My idol debut is an advantage to you
But all you waddling penguins will get hurt if you overwork because rappers these days don’t have the skills
They all have a snap back fetish, You`re such a faggot bitch
You can keep trying to cut me down but I’ll just be sculpted better
This isn’t ambition, my frequency invades your erogenous zones
I can’t acknowledge the acknowledgment I received from Tablo and Gaeko
I can’t see any signs of my achievement going away like my skin
All the singer songwriters in the overflowing groups
Groundless underground experience viral
Piss off, go pee somewhere else
This is my turf, you just go fuck yourself
Before you diss this business, let me see you piece
You can’t even compromise with those skills, you live a single-lens life so you naturally just don’t work
If you wanna diss the big name singers, go ahead, touch me first
Or just shrivel up before I sprinkle salt

[Chorus]
I’m not your friend
And I’m not your family either
I’m not your peer
Chew me wrong and all your teeth might fall out
Cause I'm a TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE
TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE
Cause I'm a TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE
Chew me wrong and all your teeth might fall out

[Outro]
Cause I'm a TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE
TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE
Cause I'm a TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE, TOUGH COOKIE
Chew me wrong and all your teeth might fall out
Mofucker!
