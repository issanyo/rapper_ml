Drink Smoke Drink Smoke Drink Smoke
Pour up
As if nothing much is going on
I laughed a bit louder for no reason
I try getting drunk
As if I don’t care ooh
I try yelling at the passing cars

But why is my heart still the same?
Without any time to think
My body is going to the club
Without any emotion
Just to avoid loneliness
I’m disappearing with a strange girl outside

Tonight I’m getting loose, loose
Her shirt is getting loose, loose
All the tied up strings are getting loose, loose
Girl now I’m looking for love for love

The more time passes, the more unfocused my eyes get
Suddenly, your voice is in my ears
I’m getting lost because I see someone who looks like you
I got 99 problems
Makes me dizzy

Was I being stupid? Was it just my imagination?
I just went to find you without any plans
I can’t forget that memory
Even traces of you and that strange guy

Why were you like that?
You had no excuse
Instead you pushed me away
Without any traces of guilt
You ended it
But why am I still lost in you?

Tonight I’m getting loose, loose
The crazy emotions are getting loose, loose
The strings that tie me to you are getting loose, loose
But I’ve been thinking bout you, bout you

The more time passes, the more unfocused my eyes get
Suddenly, your voice is in my ears
I’m getting lost because I see someone who looks like you
I got 99 problems
Makes me dizzy

In no particular order
I take off her clothes one by one
When the lights go off, it gets hotter
We’re having a deeper conversation than ever
But we can’t get any closer than this
It’s only sexy
When there’s an air of unfamiliarity
I will do you tonight, private special
Do it stage, let’s show off our chemistry
(show me what you got)
When you hold my mic
Sing me a falsetto with some vibrato
Even though I know you’re a dragonfly
That can’t be kept in a box
Should I shall come pick you up
Or just put in my address and come here

Tonight I’m getting loose, loose
Someone’s shirt is getting loose, loose
All the tied up strings are getting loose, loose
No I’m not looking for love for love

The more time passes, the more unfocused my eyes get
Suddenly, your voice is in my ears
I’m getting lost because I see someone who looks like you
I got 99 problems
