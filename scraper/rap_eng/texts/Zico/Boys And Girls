[Chorus: Babylon]
OH UH OH UH
Don’t worry about money
Let’s play, oppa will be the one who spends
Too much – You just comfortably get your
Groove on next to me, alright
I’m a boy you’re a girl
I’m a boy but you’re a girl
I’m a boy you’re a girl

[Verse 1: Zico]
Beautiful girls deserve to be treated
Call out all your friends
Only those who like to have fun and are outgoing
This is Korea but there’s a Western feel here
I’m not gonna let them put on edm
Get wet and shower with alcohol
Ice bucket challenge
I wonder who’s gonna take that drunkard
I’m all grown up but my curiosity is still like a minor
I can’t hold it in so I’m hosting a festivity

[Pre-Chorus: Zico/Babylon]
OH UH OH UH yeah
Even if you recognise me
Don’t be too obvious about it
OH UH OH UH
If all you want is to update your Insta
Then get your coat and get out
OH UH OH UH
All you nunas with appreciative eyes
Wanna see ma tattoo?
Let’s flip over our phones cuz we’re having a good time
The moment you start getting serious, you gotta go home

[Chorus: Babylon]
Don’t worry about money
Let’s play, oppa will be the one who spends
Too much – You just comfortably get your
Groove on next to me, alright
I’m a boy you’re a girl
I’m a boy but you’re a girl
I’m a boy you’re a girl
Beautiful girls deserve to be treated

[Verse 2: Zico]
Almost everyone is a hotshot at this party
If you act awkward, you’re gonna get embarrassed
Don’t reject but just drink, that’s your life shot
Take a picture with anyone and that’s your life shot
I’m intoxicated, boy girl boy girl take a seat
Even if we play lewd games
We’re careful with what we say on the outside
The sun rises and your makeup is also erasing
But before I get up from my seat, it keeps staying hot

[Pre-Chorus: Zico/Babylon]
OH UH OH UH yeah
Don’t pretend to be classy
When everyone else is getting messed up
OH UH OH UH
Don’t talk about random
Things or your worries
OH UH OH UH
What is up with that guy offering to drink for everyone?
Let’s flip over our phones cuz we’re having a good time
The moment you start getting serious, you gotta go home

[Chorus: Babylon]
Don’t worry about money
Let’s play, oppa will be the one who spends
Too much – You just comfortably get your
Groove on next to me, alright
I’m a boy you’re a girl
I’m a boy but you’re a girl
I’m a boy you’re a girl
Beautiful girls deserve to be treated

[Bridge: Zico/Babylon]
Say hello to ma little friends
They’re all well-mannered
I told them not to make any mistakes
OH UH OH UH
Don’t feel pressured, just enjoy

[Chorus: Babylon]
Don’t worry about money
Let’s play, oppa will be the one who spends
Too much – You just comfortably get your
Groove on next to me, alright
I’m a boy you’re a girl
I’m a boy but you’re a girl
I’m a boy you’re a girl
Beautiful girls deserve to be treated
