[Hook]
Keep moving on
Gotta keep the dream alive
Even when the road is gone
I get back up and realise
I keep on living day by day
No matter what's in my way

Keep pushing and let me fly away
Fly away
Let me fly away
Fly away

[Verse 1]
Yeah (Let me fly)
Have you ever wanted something so bad that you can pratically taste it?
To the point you would give up everything to chase it?
Faced with people telling you that you'll never make it
But your time is now and you ain't 'bout to waste it all you're life you've waited
Have you ever felt like breaking down? Cause you have a dream that people can't seem to wrap their head around
No nothing bout me but they quick to doubt me
Looking at me funny like my name was Mike Wazoski
But you gotta keep on pushing through it
We all got a dream but only if you are brave enough to pursue it
Cause there is no express lane on the road to the top
They gon try to slow you down try to force you to stop

[Pre-Hook]
That's when you look em in the eyes raise your middle finger high
Tell em you can't hold me down baby I was born to fly
If you want it bad enough there's nothing you can do
Cause I am living breathing proof that dreams come true

[Hook]

Yeah did you ever feel alone like it's you against the world like you have to run your own
You calling out for help but noone's picking up the phone
Well now they calling back but leave your message at the tone
Cause when things turn real that's when people turn fake
They love you when you're something but hate you when you ain't
Damn, but regardless the one that go the farthest is the one that tunes em out and just keep working his hardest
I used to walk around with my head down
Sometimes I thought about giving up
But baby take a look at where I'm at now
?
