[Verse 1]
Watch the way I come alive
When you are by my side
It happens every time
Got me wondering every night
How the fuck you're mine
I can't believe you're mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I love the feeling when
I'm kissing you in public
In a crowded room
I'm so proud of you, eh
I love the way my friends
Are jealous 'cause you're perfect
Want the world to see
You belong to me

[Chorus]
I love showing you off
Showing you off
Showing you off
I love showing you off
Showing you off
Showing you off
'Cause you got what I want
Got what I want
Got what I want
So I love showing you off
Showing you off
Showing you off

[Verse 2]
Confident and beautiful
But you never try too hard
And that's my favorite part
That's why I love you
Maybe I'm delusional
A perfect work of art
You shine just like the stars

[Pre-Chorus]
I love the feeling when
I'm kissing you in public
In a crowded room
I'm so proud of you, eh
I love the way my friends
Are jealous 'cause you're perfect
Want the world to see
You belong to me

[Chorus]
I love showing you off
Showing you off
Showing you off
I love showing you off
Showing you off
Showing you off
'Cause you got what I want
Got what I want
Got what I want
So I love showing you off
Showing you off
Showing you off

[Post-Chorus]
I don't need diamonds and gold
Just want your body to hold
I'll be right by your side
I'm here to help you shine
I don't need diamonds and gold
Just need your body to hold
I'll be right by your side
I'm here to help you shine

[Chorus]
I love showing you off
Showing you off
Showing you off
I love showing you off
Showing you off
Showing you off
'Cause you got what I want
Got what I want
Got what I want
So I love showing you off
Showing you off
Showing you off, yeah

[Post-Chorus/Outro]
I don't need diamonds and gold
Just want your body to hold
I'll be right by your side
I'm here to help you shine
I don't need diamonds and gold
Just want your body to hold
I'll be right by your side
I'm here to help you shine
