H-I-G-H L-I-F-E, wait..

[Hook; Jake Miller and Jeremy Thurber]
We keep it crazy
Sexy, cool
Living the high life
Cause that's how we do
Let's go all night
We're living high life
Welcome to the high life
We're gonna be alright
We're living high life
Welcome to the high life
Yeah

[Verse 1; Jake Miller]
Yeah riding 'round my city
I got a blondie
Sitting shorty
And she lookin' pretty
We're burning rubber
While we're swirving
Down the innerstate
H-I-G-H L-I-F-E
On my license plate
Top down and we faded
We ridin' 'round and we made it
Put a clip in the front
Put it in the park
And we hopin out
Like we're famous
It's just me
And all of my homies
We ballin' out like Kobe
Got my hoodie over my head
Lookin like Obi Wan Kenobe
So let's break it down
Turn it up
We're gonna do this all night
I'd like to welcome all you
To the high life

[Hook]

[Verse 2; Jake Miller]
Okay we on top of the world
Like Big Sean and JB
Who's that dude that's on TV?
Wait, he looks a lot like me
See I be flyin cross the country
Every night just like I'm Santa
Yea, I'm livin the dream
That's why I'm always in pyjamas
Got the world under my spell
Like I know voodoo
I want girls that look like Megan Fox
Yours look more like Honey Boo-Boo
Yea, I need some nutrisystem
Cause my pockets lookin' fat now
So many girls up in my crib
It's lookin' like a frat house
So take my hand baby
We gon' do this all night
I'd like to welcome all you to the high life
