[Verse 1: Jake Miller]
She walks on red carpets everywhere she goes
You can find her, all designer from her head to toe
Out in Calabasas, she think she the baddest, yeah
But your heart is plastic, that shit ain't attractive, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jake Miller]
Can you be a real human for a second please?
This ain't TV, no one's watching, this just you and me
Girl, what's your problem? Why you think you're better than me?
Better than me?

[Chorus: Jake Miller]
Light up for all the cameras, pose for them magazines
But can you show me the side they never see?
I know you know you're special, but if you're feeling me
I wanna talk to the girl that's underneath

[Verse 2: Jake Miller]
Knows the bouncers and promoters, never wait in line
Why the fuck you wearing glasses when we inside?
Standing in her section, looking down and texting, yeah
She just wants attention, she knows she can get it, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jake Miller]
Can you be a real human for a second please?
This ain't TV, no one's watching, this just you and me
Girl, what's your problem? Why you think you're better than me?
Better than me?

[Chorus: Jake Miller]
Light up for all the cameras, pose for them magazines
But can you show me the side they never see?
I know you know you're special, but if you're feeling me
I wanna talk to the girl that's underneath

[Verse 3: Jabbar Hakeem]
Yeah, yeah, oh my God
Ayy, let me talk to you, yeah
If you don't understand, I'ma walk you through
I ain't worried 'bout the fame or the cars or the planes
Those are things I know you often do, for real, yeah
But what you really like to do?
Lemme know and maybe I can plan a night for you
'Cause you the only one that match my fly
Just feel the vibe, I can put you on a natural high
And girl, I know that you a star, yeah
But I'm tryna get to know just who you are
I would never be the type to break your heart
So gon' and take off that mask and show your flaws, I won't judge you
Girl, yes, it's alright
Just be you, don't hide
I need the real you
Oh my God

[Chorus: Jake Miller & (Jabbar Hakeem)]
Light up for all the cameras, pose for them magazines
But can you show me the side they never see?
I know you know you're special, but if you're feeling me (you special)
I wanna talk to the girl that's underneath (yeah, yeah)
Light up for all the cameras, pose for them magazines
But can you show me the side they never see?
I know you know you're special, but if you're feeling me
I wanna talk to the girl that's underneath
I wanna talk to the girl that's underneath
I wanna talk to the girl that's underneath
