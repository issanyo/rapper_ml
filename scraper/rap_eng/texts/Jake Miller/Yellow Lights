[Verse 1]
Look, she hit me up on the regular
3 AM and she blowin' up my cellular
Every night she got my phone going brrr brrr
So I'm bout to serve it up, Roger Federer
Lately I've been coming through, like every night
Cause she know she can get it whenever she like
She in the bed and she layin' on her back
Sending pictures to my phone
Like "I'm ready, where you at?"

[Pre-Chorus]
I know she want it
That's why she callin'
She got me running

[Chorus]
All these yellow lights
She craving, waiting for it every night
I'm speeding, fiending for that paradise
That's why I'm flying through these yellow lights
Can't think twice, she want it bad
She want it bad
Can't think twice, I"m running that

[Verse 2]
Can't think twice cause she want it bad
Full speed, tryna score like a running back
Cop cars in my rearview
Tryna slow me down now, ha, good luck with that
I'm swerving lanes, stick shift
Windows down, Tokyo Drift shit
I'm getting closer every minute
She keep on sending pictures to my phone
Like "I'm ready, come and get it"

[Pre-Chorus]
I know she want it
That's why she callin'
She got me running

[Chorus]
All these yellow lights
She craving, waiting for it every night
I'm speeding, fiending for that paradise
That's why I'm flying through these yellow lights
Can't think twice, she want it bad
She want it bad
Can't think twice, I"m running that

[Bridge]
Girl, I'm on my way, way, way
Just wait up for me, me, me
I got what you need, need, need
I can't wait 'til you are next to me
So I just keep running all of these

[Chorus]
Yellow lights
She craving, waiting for it every night
I'm speeding, fiending for that paradise
That's why I'm flying through these yellow lights
Can't think twice, she want it bad
She want it bad
Can't think twice, I"m running that
She want it bad
So bad, so bad
Can't think twice, I"m running that
