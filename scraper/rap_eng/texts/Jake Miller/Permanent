[Intro]
Is this permanent
Permanent

[Verse 1]
I think your friends know more
About us than I do
I don't know what to say
When my mom asks about you
I guess I'm confused
Tell me the truth
Do we have a chance
Or are we through
I think your friends know more
About us than I do
I just need to know...

[Chorus]
Is permanent what we meant
When we said that we needed space
How could you forget the time we spent
How do you know when it's time
To throw it all away
Is this permanent, permanent, permanent
Is this permanent, permanent
Is this permanent, permanent, permanent
Is this permanent, permanent

[Verse 2]
I still drive by your house
On my way home
I keep my eyes on the road
I don't wanna know
If there's somebody new
There with you
Making you laugh
Just like I used to
I still drive by your house
On my way home

[Chorus]
Is permanent what we meant
When we said that we needed space
How could you forget the time we spent
How do you know when it's time
To throw it all away
Is this permanent, permanent, permanent
Is this permanent, permanent
Is this permanent, permanent, permanent
Is this permanent, permanent

[Bridge]
Yeah, tell me
Is it permanent
Is this a forever thing
That just what I want baby
I was thinking wedding ring
But you won't even pick the damn phone up
I just think that we deserve closure
You're with your new man
I'm with my new girl
Drinking every night
Trying not to think of you girl
Can't tell if we up and [?]
I just need to know if this is permanent

[Chorus]
Is permanent what we meant
When we said that we needed space
How could you forget the time we spent
How do you know when it's time
To throw it all away
Is this permanent, permanent, permanent
Is it permanent babe, I just need to know babe
Is this permanent, permanent, permanent
Is this permanent, permanent
