[Bridge]
She took my heart when I was 15
I love everything about you
And now I honestly can't see
Going a single day without you

[Hook]
You are the air I breathe
You are my everything
Baby come and follow me
Till the end of the world
I won't live a day without your love
I won't live a day without your love

[Verse 1]
Now I've been flipping through the dictionary trying to find
The proper words that I could use to tell you what's on my mind
But baby this time its different and for me it's a first
Cause now I'm sitting here with nothing but a loss for words
It's like you reset my heart and then erased my brain
The only thing that's not deleted in my head is your name
So doctor please give me some Aderal I'm having trouble concentrating
She hypnotized me, mastered the art of captivating
So there ya go, bravo, congratulations
A massive understatement if I said my heart was taken
Cause now I'm hooked I'll admit my hearts your puppet
I don't know how you did it but I love it cause...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I told myself a while ago I'd never let this happen
You're way to young to fall in love, just concentrate on rapping
But then you came along, and all my plans rearranged
And then suddenly, everything changed
Now you're my world, my sun, my moon and everything between them
Some people kinda skeptical but baby we don't need them
We could run away, and never come back
Yeah we could leave today, pick anywhere on the map
As long as your by my side I gotta smile on my face
But when you gone girl I swear that I feel so out of place
I've know you've heard it before I can't say it enough
I couldn't live a single day without your love, because...
