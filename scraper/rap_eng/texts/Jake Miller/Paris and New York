[Verse 1]
We turn colder, your seasons changed
Tell me if we are drifting apart
Or tell me when did it go wrong
And it's obvious we needed space
Maybe we're just getting older
How do we both get so lost

[Pre-Chorus]
So far away
But now we're here we're still the same, it's you and I
And we the same, and we the same

[Chorus]
Paris and New York
Paris and New York
Talking 'bout you and me
Paris and New York
Paris and New York
Can't change who we are
Paris and New York
Paris and New York
Still I got to get from Paris to New-York
Paris and New-York
Paris and New-York

[Post-Chorus]
Paranoia

[Verse 2]
Maybe my heart's in a difference place
Guess that we got so lost in our time zones
Trying to do this alone baby
Somethings never change
Always go back being lovers
Only time we get along

[Pre-Chorus]
So far away
But now we're here we're still the same, it's you and I
And we the same, and we the same

[Chorus]
Paris and New York
Paris and New York
Talking 'bout you and me
Paris and New York
Paris and New York
Can't change who we are
Paris and New York
Paris and New York
Still I got to get from Paris to New-York
Paris and New-York
Paris and New-York

[Post-Chorus]
Paranoia

[Bridge]
Oh, we're not the same but far from different
Yeah
You and I are just like...

[Chorus]
Paris and New York
Paris and New York
Talking 'bout you and me
Paris and New York
Paris and New York
Can't change who we are
Paris and New York
Paris and New York
Still I got to get from Paris to New-York
Paris and New-York
Paris and New-York

[Post-Chorus]
