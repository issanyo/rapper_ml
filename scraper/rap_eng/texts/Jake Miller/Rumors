Yeah, heh, rumors

[Verse 1]
Yeah, we the word up on the streets
They talk, talk, talk 'bout you and me
Let's start some rumors, rumors
And no, I don't know where they came from
But I'm always down to make some, rumors, rumors

3 A.M. to catch a flight
Caught me driving through your hood
Paparazzi got me good

Look at everybody camping out with they binoculars
All up in the headlines, me and the wifey
But let them gossip girl, Blake Lively

"Have you heard the rumors?" Wait what? Rumors
