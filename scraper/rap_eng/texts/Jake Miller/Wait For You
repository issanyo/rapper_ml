[Intro]
Wait for you
Wait for you

[Verse 1]
You say your heart is too fragile
Maybe we should keep it casual, that's fine, that's fine
He broke your heart into pieces
I know that you are still healing, that's fine, it's on
I think you could use someone like me
But you ain't ready yet, you're scared to love again
I think you could use someone like me
It's killing me inside, but you can take your time

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'll wait for you
No matter how long I have to
Yeah I'll wait for you
And every night I'm hurtin'
But I know you'll be worth it
So I'll wait

[Chorus]
I will wait for you
I will wait for you
I will wait for you
I will, I will
I will wait for you
I will wait for you
I will wait for you
I will, I will

[Verse 2]
I stopped to run out of patience
Will not stop picturing you naked, no lie, no lie
You're sleeping alone but I'm jealous
'Cause I got a space in my bed that's your size, your size
I think you could use someone like me
But you ain't ready yet, you're scared to love again
I think you could use someone like me
It's killing me inside, but you can take your time

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'll wait for you
No matter how long I have to
Yeah I'll wait for you
And every night I'm hurtin'
But I know you'll be worth it
So I'll wait

[Chorus]
I will wait for you
I will wait for you (Yeah I'll wait)
I will wait for you
I will, I will (As long as it takes)
I will wait for you
I will wait for you
I will wait for you
I will, I will

[Bridge]
Watch the season change
But you still get me
Up your mind, how much time do I have to waste?
Always get that rush
When my phone lights up
It's never you, I should just give you up but

[Outro]
I'll wait for you
No matter how long I have to
Yeah I'll wait for you
And every night I'm hurtin'
But I know you'll be worth it
So I'll wait
