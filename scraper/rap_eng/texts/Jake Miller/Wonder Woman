You can let 'em see the game
But they can never see the practice

If he don't know how to play, take is toys away
If you wanna play the fool tell him it's cool, it's cool

You can do anything you want
Just learn to control your power
If you've got what they need you've got the control

So if you wanna play rough call his bluff
If he don't know how to play, take is toys away
If you wanna play the fool tell him it's cool, it's cool

Go ahead and use your superpowers
Wonder woman, wonder woman
You know you got them superpowers
Wonder woman, wonder woman

Why you wanna lock me up and tighten up your g- string?
No need to over react, baby just maintain
You know I was only playin', please dont' let this be a issue
Girl I swear that I'm official, I was just sayin'
