[Verse 1]
Today I met a man, sitting on the corner
He was holding out his hand, had a couple quarters
That he saved up in a can
I think I heard him whisper that you'll never understand
Damn, no place to call his home said he lives alone so he's forced to roam
With a shopping cart filled to the top with every thing he owns
A smile on his face, yep there he stood
He was holding up sign saying life is good
Man, I wonder what it'd be like, a day in his shoes
I guess when you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
He said boy, don't you pity me, I'm still standing tall
As a matter of fact, I got it all

[Hook]
I got life, I got love
I got faith and that's enough
We feel sorrow, we feel pain
But there's sunshine after rain
So I'm alright (you'll be fine, take it one day at time)
So I'm alright (said you'll be fine, take it one day at time)

[Verse 2]
Today I met a man makes a couple hundred grand
Always stressing out got 2 cell phones in his hand
Lives the country club life, think he's on his third wife
Never makes it home for dinner cause he's working every night
Five cars in the garage, four he's never driven
Always wanting more than just the life that he's been given
Got a strange obsession with material possessions
Now he's always popping Prozac to battle his depression
He's got everything he's ever wanted, and he's always trying to flaunt it
But now it's all coming back to haunt him
Mistaken what's important in life for all the pointless stuff
For some people, everything's just not enough

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You gotta keep going, never give it up
You only live once, might as well live it up
Every breath I take is a reason to believe
That the finest things in life, came to me for free
Said you gotta keep going, never give it up
You only live once, might as well live it up
Every breath I take is a reason to believe
That the finest things in life, came to me for free

[Hook] (x2)

Yeah, you got, nothing to lose, haha
