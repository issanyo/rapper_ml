She caught my eye as she was walking by
Cute face, great smile with some big brown eyes
Type of girl that's used to guys blowing kisses at her
But I didn't know what to say so I just whistled at her, like

[Bridge]
Damn, baby look at you go
From head to toe you're a "10" have I seen you before?
I'd love to talk, I just don't know how to go about it
So instead I had to go and write a song about it

[Verse 1]
Haha, how you doing? Tell me what your name is?
A simple conversation that's usually quick and painless, but
I'm sweating bullets, shaking in my shoes
The angel on my shoulders says I got nothing to lose, but
Girl, can you lend me some of your confidence
You'd be a billionaire if currency was compliments
High heels, even higher self-esteem
Turning heads, breaking necks, when she step up on the scene
But wait, hold up, I think she's walking my way
Come on man, you got this, today is the day
I know you're nervous dude, but don't show it
Will you finally make a move or will you blow it?
She's getting closer now, she's getting closer
Looking like a supermodel right out of a poster
Type of girl that's used to guys blowing kisses at her
But I didn't know what to say so I just whistled at her, like

Yeah, so I whistled at her, like

[Verse 2]
Yeah, same story just a different day
Got my inhaler with me, she take my breath away
My old man used to prep me with some pick-up lines
But when I see her not a single one come to mind
Man, I thought I had at least a little game
All this trouble and I haven't even got her name
Yo Hitch, where you at, I need your help dude
This chick is playing with my brain like a GameCube
Ha, she got me feeling like a kid again
You'll be my Lois Lane, I'll be your Superman
Yeah, but maybe first I should grow a pair
And find the courage to come over there
So, here I go, yeah I think I'm ready
Rehearsed it in the mirror 50 times already
But now I'm thinking that I should have done it 51
Cause all I want to do is turn around and run, but
I'm getting closer now, I'm getting closer
She's like a supermodel right out of a poster
Used to guys blowing kisses at her
But I just couldn't find the words so I just whistled at her, like

Yeah, so I whistled at her, like

[Bridge] (x2)

Whistle baby
Yeah, so I whistled at her, like

[Hook] (x2)
