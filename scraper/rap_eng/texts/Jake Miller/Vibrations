[Intro]
(Through my body)
(Through my bo-, bo-)
(Through my body)
(Through my bo-)

[Verse 1]
Me and you, that's a fire
I could lay here my whole life
I love your style, just my type
So much more than meets the eye

[Pre-Chorus]
So caught up in the moment, oh yeah
I wanna ride this wave all night
I keep the liquor pouring, oh yeah
'Cause I'm not tryna waste no time
So caught up in the moment, oh yeah
I wanna dive inside your mind
This energy, it doesn't lie

[Chorus]
I love your vibrations
I love your vibrations
I wanna make your body shake
Oh God don't make me wait
'Cause I love your vibrations
So come vibrate on me

[Post-Chorus]
(Through my body)
(Through my bo-, bo-)
(Through my body)
(Through my bo-)
So come vibrate on me
(Through my body)
(Through my bo-, bo-)
(Through my body)
(Through my bo-)

[Verse 2]
Don't look down, we're too high
I'ma make you scream all night
Just lay back, close your eyes
Get it just the way you like

[Pre-Chorus]
So caught up in the moment, oh yeah
I wanna ride this wave all night
I keep the liquor pouring, oh yeah
'Cause I'm not tryna waste no time
So caught up in the moment, oh yeah
I wanna dive inside your mind
This energy, it doesn't lie

[Chorus]
I love your vibrations
I love your vibrations
I wanna make your body shake
Oh God don't make me wait
'Cause I love your vibrations
So come vibrate on me

[Post-Chorus]
(Through my body)
(Through my bo-, bo-)
(Through my body)
(Through my bo-)
So come vibrate on me
(Through my body)

(Through my body)
(Through my bo-)

[Bridge]
This energy, it doesn't lie, no, no
This energy, you can't deny, no, oh

[Chorus]
I love your vibrations
I love your vibrations
I wanna make your body shake
Oh God don't make me wait
'Cause I love your vibrations
So come vibrate on me

(Through my bo-)
Come vibrate on me
