[Intro]
It's when you look at me like that
Baby, I don't wanna fight that
Yeah, we got a good thing going

[Verse 1]
Waking up next to your body got me thinking serious
So caught up but I won't tell nobody
They'll just label us

[Pre-Chorus]
We ain't gotta do that yet
Not until we see what's next
I just wanna feel your lips and get to know you better
We ain't gotta go too fast
Why we gotta rush like that?
I just wanna close my eyes and memorize each other

[Chorus]
You don't have to go nowhere, baby
We got a good thing going, going on
I can take you all the way, baby
Let's keep this good thing going, going strong
It's when you look at me like that
Baby, I don't wanna fight that
Yeah, we got a good thing going
Yeah, we got a good thing
Yeah, we got a good thing

[Verse 2]
Instead of looking for what's next
I'll just lay here next to you
So caught up that I only wanna say
Three more words to you

[Pre-Chorus]
We ain't gotta do that yet
Not until we see what's next
I just wanna feel your lips and get to know you better
We ain't gotta go too fast
Why we gotta rush like that?
I just wanna close my eyes and memorize each other

[Chorus]
You don't have to go nowhere, baby
We got a good thing going, going on
I can take you all the way, baby
Let's keep this good thing going, going strong
It's when you look at me like that
Baby, I don't wanna fight that
Yeah, we got a good thing going
Yeah, we got a good thing
Yeah, we got a good thing

[Bridge]
And when you say my name
I fall deeper, I fall deeper into it all
It's more than just a phase
I fall deeper, I fall deeper into it all

[Chorus]
You don't have to go nowhere, baby
We got a good thing going, going on
I can take you all the way, baby
Let's keep this good thing going, going strong
It's when you look at me like that
Baby, I don't wanna fight that
Yeah, we got a good thing going
Yeah, we got a good thing
Yeah, we got a good thing
