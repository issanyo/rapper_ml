Do you remember last October
We called it quits and cried all night
That's the last time you slept over
Maybe we just needed time, yeah

Let's pick this up from where we left
I'll take you places we used to love
If we don't try then we'll never know

It's starting to feel like
Maybe we are starting over
It's starting to feel like
We might make it out alive
No we're not in the clear
But we are getting closer
Let's bring this love back to life

Do you remember how to love me?
'Cause baby my heart hasn't change
Please remember how to love me
'Cause I still wanna give
You my last name, oh yeah

Let's pick this up from where we left
I'll take you places we used to love
If we don't try then we'll never know

It's starting to feel like
Maybe we are starting over
It's starting to feel like
We might make it out alive
No we're not in the clear
But we are getting closer
Let's bring this love back to life

It's starting to feel like
Maybe we are starting over
It's starting to feel like
We might make it out alive
No we're not in the clear
But we are getting closer
Let's bring this love back to life

Starting over, yeah
Let's bring it back now
Bring it back now babe, yeah
We're starting over, yeah
Let's bring this love back to life
