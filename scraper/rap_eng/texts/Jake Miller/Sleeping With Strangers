[Verse 1]
Falling asleep at somebody elses
She's your replacement for now
I'm only in this stranger's apartement
'Cause you seem like the stranger now

[Pre-Chorus]
This lifestyle I have
It's over rated, I'm startin' to hate it
Wasted and sad without you

[Chorus]
Falling asleep at somebody elses
It's just not for me, I'm gettin' reckless
Maybe I hate sleeping with strangers, na-na-na
This can't be real, this can't be over
I miss how you feel, I miss being sober
Baby I hate sleeping with strangers, na-na-na

[Verse 2]
She's not my type but she'll do for now
'Cause she's wearing your same perfume
So I close my eyes and picture you smiling
Wishing she'll turn into you

[Chorus]
Falling asleep at somebody elses
It's just not for me, I'm gettin' reckless
Maybe I hate sleeping with strangers, na-na-na
This can't be real, this can't be over
I miss how you feel, I miss being sober
Baby I hate sleeping with strangers, na-na-na

[Pre-Chorus]
This lifestyle I have
It's over rated, I'm startin' to hate it
Wasted and sad without you

[Chorus]
Falling asleep at somebody elses
It's just not for me, I'm gettin' reckless
Maybe I hate sleeping with strangers, na-na-na
This can't be real, this can't be over
I miss how you feel, I miss being sober
Baby I hate sleeping with strangers, na-na-na

[Chorus]
Falling asleep at somebody elses
It's just not for me, I'm gettin' reckless
Maybe I hate sleeping with strangers, na-na-na
This can't be real, this can't be over
I miss how you feel, I miss being sober
Baby I hate sleeping with strangers, na-na-na
