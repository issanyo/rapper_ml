[Verse 1]
You've been cut right down the middle
Crushed into a hundred parts
I know this might hurt a little
But I will only make it worse

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you but I can't be the reason why
You lose faith in everything that you find
I'm warning you now babe
Go run and hide

[Chorus]
I wish you didn't love me (I wish you didn't love me)
I wish you didn't care about me at all
'Cause even I don't trust me
So I'ma let you down before you fall
And maybe in another life
We can try this one more time
But right now please don't love me (But right now please don't love me)
'Cause I don't deserve you at all (Cause I don't deserve you at all)

[Verse 2]
Baby I wish things were different
I wish you were by my side
Baby I ain't no magician
But I might disappear tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you but I can't be the reason why
You lose faith in everything that you find
I'm warning you now babe
Go run and hide

[Chorus]
I wish you didn't love me (I wish you didn't love me)
I wish you didn't care about me at all
'Cause even I don't trust me
So I'ma let you down before you fall
And maybe in another life
We can try this one more time
But right now please don't love me
'Cause I don't deserve you at all (Cause I don't deserve you at all)

[Outro]
Don't love me, please don't love me
'Cause I don't deserve you at all
Don't love me, please don't love me
'Cause I don't deserve you at all
