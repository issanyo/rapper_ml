[Intro]
Tonight, we gon' party in the penthouse
Well, alright, alright, alright
Yeah
Look

[Verse 1]
This ain't no ordinary average kind of night (c'mon)
We know that we just can't afford to do this twice (we can't)
We only got one chance, so we gotta do this right
Yeah, we livin' it up
Forget about all your plans, you can run and tell all your friends
We gon' party in the penthouse
Reserve a room at the W
Panoramic top floor, everybody's coming through
Bathrobe and boxers, calling room service
Ordering some lobster and some cheeseburgers in this bitch
Hotel staff is getting pissed cause they weren't invited to this shit
We gon' dance with the maids, and pretend like we're Bill Gates
Throw this money like we just got paid
We gon' party in the penthouse

[Chorus]
We might be flat broke, but for one night feel like we made it
We gon' party in the penthouse
We all wanna know what it's like one night to be famous
We gon' party in the penthouse

[Verse 2]
Just take the elevator right up to the sky
We at the top, I hope you not afraid of heights
We spent this money, so we gotta do it right
Yeah, we living it up
Forget about all your plans, you can run and tell all your friends
We gon' party in the penthouse
Taking shots at this instrumental
On the balcony, like what's up? Get on my level
Spilling liquor on this California king, singing "money ain't a thing," You can chart it to my incidentals
Whoo! I'm on my Gatsby shit
Pinkies up, I'm on my classy shit
One time, throw your glass in the air
'Cause we started from the lobby now we here
We gon' party in the penthouse

[Chorus]
We might be flat broke, but for one night feel like we made it
We gon' party in the penthouse
We all wanna know what it's like one night to be famous
We gon' party in the penthouse

[Bridge]
La, la, la-la-la (Everybody in the penthouse singin')
La, la, la-la-la (Yeah, we gon' party in the penthouse)
La, la, la-la-la (Everybody in the penthouse singin')
La, la, la-la-la
Yeah
We gon' party in the penthouse

[Chorus]
We might be flat broke, but for one night feel like we made it
We gon' party in the penthouse
We all wanna know what it's like one night to be famous
We gon' party in the penthouse

[Chorus]
We might be flat broke, but for one night feel like we made it
We gon' party in the penthouse
We all wanna know what it's like one night to be famous
We gon' party in the penthouse
