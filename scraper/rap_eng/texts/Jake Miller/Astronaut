[Verse 1]
I've been awaiting all my life, waiting for your time, baby
Half a million sleepless nights, just to feel your touch for a minute

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I've been begging for it, babe, I know
We keep running into this mess, oh no
I just wanna feel your love close
But I don't think you know that

[Chorus]
I'm feeling like an astronaut, like an astronaut
With this space between us in this bed
Feeling like an astronaut, like my heart will stop
'Cause you know that you're my oxygen
It feels like I'm a world away when, baby, you're right next to me
I'm feeling like an astronaut, like an astronaut, astronaut
Astronaut, oh whoa

[Verse 2]
You've been on my mind for days
The tension in between us, can you feel it?
Is this my reality? Or maybe it's a dream, babe
But you in it

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I've been begging for it, babe, I know
We keep running into this mess, oh no
I just wanna feel your love close
But I don't think you know that

[Chorus]
I'm feeling like an astronaut, like an astronaut
With this space between us in this bed
Feeling like an astronaut, like my heart will stop
'Cause you know that you're my oxygen
It feels like I'm a world away
When, baby, you're right next to me
I'm feeling like an astronaut, like an astronaut, astronaut
Astronaut

[Chorus]
I'm feeling like an astronaut, like an astronaut
With this space between us in this bed
Feeling like an astronaut, like my heart will stop
'Cause you know that you're my oxygen
It feels like I'm a world away
When, baby, you're right next to me
I'm feeling like an astronaut, like an astronaut, astronaut
Astronaut, oh whoa
