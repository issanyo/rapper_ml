[Hook]
Will you remember me? (will you remember me?)
When I'm dead and gone (when I'm dead and gone)
When I'm dead and gone (when I'm dead and gone)
When I'm dead and gone, gone, gone
Will you remember me? (will you remember me?)
When I'm dead and gone (when I'm dead and gone)
When I'm dead and gone (when I'm dead and gone)
When I'm dead and gone, gone, gone
Will you remember me? (will you remember me?)
Will you remember me?
I hope you remember me
Imma make you remember me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'll be honest
This song will probably never go platinum
But listen close
'Cause it's the most important song on this album
All those numbers on your tombstone
Those don't mean a thing
What really matters most is that dash that's in between
Will you remember me long after I'm dead and gone?
Six feet in the ground, But everything I built will carry on
Everything I work for, everything I live for
That shit is so much deeper than just selling out to Philmore
I promise I'mma help you find your passion, I'mma change your life
Imma guide you through this tunnel 'til you see the light
Always givin' you my heart and soul
When I'm gone where does it go?
I just gotta know

[Hook]
Will you remember me? (will you remember me?)
When I'm dead and gone (when I'm dead and gone)
When I'm dead and gone (when I'm dead and gone)
When I'm dead and gone, gone, gone
Will you remember me? (will you remember me?)
When I'm dead and gone (when I'm dead and gone)
When I'm dead and gone (when I'm dead and gone)
When I'm dead and gone, gone, gone
Will you remember me? (will you remember me?)
Will you remember me?
I hope you remember me
Imma make you remember me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, look I'll be honest
This song will probably never go platinum
But listen close
'Cause it's the most important song on this album
So when I'm dead and gone, will you remember me?
When I was young I remember my dad said to me
"You better leave your mark
You better leave your imprint
Your life is just a waste if you don't try and make a difference
'Cause if you have the power to change the world
And you don't use it right
I'll be honest with you I don't know how you could sleep at night?
But forget about you
I'm tryin' to right my own wrongs
Tryin' to inspire other people through these rap songs
Givin' you my heart and soul
When I'm gone, where does it go?
I just gotta know

[Hook]
Will you remember me? (will you remember me?)
When I'm dead and gone (when I'm dead and gone)
When I'm dead and gone (when I'm dead and gone)
When I'm dead and gone, gone, gone
Will you remember me? (will you remember me?)
When I'm dead and gone (when I'm dead and gone)
When I'm dead and gone (when I'm dead and gone)
When I'm dead and gone, gone, gone
Will you remember me? (will you remember me?)
Will you remember me?

[Bridge: Jake Miller]

But listen close
'Cause it's the most important song on this album
See, I'll be honest
This song will probably never go platinum
But listen close
'Cause it's the most important song on this album
This song will probably never go platinum
But listen close
'Cause it's the most important song on this album
(Will you remember me?)
