[Intro]

[Hook x2: Jake Miller]
Me and you (you, you, you)
Yeah we gonna burn this city down
And the only ones
That'll make it out are
Me and you (you, you, you)
Yeah it don't matter where we go
We'll leave behind all that we know

Just me and you [x5]
Just doing what
We're doing now
Just me and you [x5]
Just doing what
We're doing now

[Verse 1: Jake Miller]
Listen up girl
I could be your getaway
Loosen up girl
I can take your pain away
So tonight baby
We can throw the deuces up
There's not much time for us anyway
Let's shake this city
Like an earthquake
I'll stand by you
Until my legs break
Burn this city down
We can ride around top
Then tell me how's
That for a first date?
Cause I've been up for days
Thinking about escaping now
We can have it made
Fuck this place
We're breaking out
So peace out
Cause we gone
Girl I know you're nervous
But we can take 'em on
Us against them
The whole world vs

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jake Miller]
Yeah you're my partner in crime
Like Bonnie and Clyde
Like Batman and Robin
I'll catch you
When you're falling
Baby say the word
I can run up
When you're calling
I got your back like a saddle
If you sink baby
I can be your paddle
We're like Harold and Kumar
One day I'mma make you
A queen and put you
In a white castle
Baby I've been up for days
Thinking about escaping now
We can have it made
Fuck this place
We're breaking out
So peace out
Cause we gone
Girl I know you're nervous
But we can take 'em on
Us against them
The whole world vs
