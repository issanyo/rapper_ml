[Verse 1]
Word round town, you've been missin' me
But they don't know we're not meant to be
Whatever's whatever, I'll always care
But I can care for you from a distance
I saw your girl, and she said I'm wrong
It's obvious you've said that I've done you wrong
Whatever you said it, just know I respect it
But I can love you from a distance

[Pre-Chorus]
It's always two sides to a story
Then the truth
No matter what I try
Wasn't good enough for you

[Chorus]
This lost time we livin' in
Rocked our beds right up and down
This lost time we livin' in
Had our love and it's runnin out
This lost time we livin' in
I'm only wasted now

[Verse 2]
I can't go on livin' like I do
Pretending that I never care for you
But we fight and we break up
You cry out your make up
So I should love you from a distance

[Pre-Chorus]
It's always two sides to a story
Then the truth
No matter what I try
Wasn't good enough for you

[Chorus]
This lost time we livin' in
Rocked our beds right up and down
This lost time we livin' in
Had our love and it's runnin out
This lost time we livin' in
I'm only wasted now

[Bridge]
It's always two sides to a story
Then the truth
No matter what I try
Wasn't good enough for you

[Chorus]
This lost time we livin' in
Rocked our beds right up and down
This lost time we livin' in
Had our love and it's runnin out
This lost time we livin' in
I'm only waisted now
This lost time we livin' in
Rocked our beds right up and down
This lost time we livin' in
Had our love and it's runnin out
This lost time we livin' in
I'm only waisted now
