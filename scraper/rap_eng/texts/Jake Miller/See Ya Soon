(Verse 1)
Yeah
I've been away for quite some time now
I think its time I come home
Yeah
And if you ask me, Ill say I'm just fine, but
Deep inside I'm alone
D*mn
And I dont know if I can do this much longer
Baby, help me pull through
Trust me
The good life isn't all that good
When I can't even enjoy it with you

(Hook)
Girl, I can't wait to come home to you
No, I can't wait to come home to you
I just need to see your face
I just need to hear your voice
This whole missin' you thing just won't do
Baby, I need to come home to you
Yeah, I can't wait to come home to you
Wait, you know what?
Screw it girl, I comin' back right now
This whole missin' you thing is now through
See ya soon

(Verse 2)
I havn't kissed your lips almost six to seven weeks, now
Startin' to feel like amiss
The closest thing i've seen in a smile in a while
Is the smiley face when we text
Girl, I hate to see you cry, and its hard to stay strong
So I'm constantly just tryna pretend
That it doesnt kill me deep inside
When I look into your eyes
Cause I always end up leavin' again

Yeah, but
Now I'm done doin' that
I come and I go, but I'm through with that
No, I'm never gonna leave your side again
So tell me, are you cool with that?
Yeah, ha, me too
Now its just me and you
I love you baby, ill see ya soon

(Hook)
Girl, I can't wait to come home to you
No, I can't wait to come home to you
I just need to see your face
I just need to hear your voice
This whole missin' you thing just won't do
Baby, I need to come home to you
Yeah, I can't wait to come home to you
Wait, you know what?
Screw it girl, I comin' back right now
This whole missin' you thing is now through
See ya soon

(Bridge)
Baby, you my everything
Yeah I hope you know it
But when I'm half way across the world
Its hard to show it
Always beggin' me to come home
So that's what I'mma do
Yeah, I'm hoppin' on the first flight out
Ill see ya soon
Baby, you my everything
Yeah I hope you know it
But when I'm half way across the world
Its hard to show it
Always beggin' me to come home
So that's what I'mma do
Yeah, I'm hoppin' on the first flight out

(Hook)
Girl, I can't wait to come home to you
No, I can't wait to come home to you
I just need to see your face
I just need to hear your voice
This whole missin' you thing just won't do
Baby, I need to come home to you
Yeah, I can't wait to come home to you
Wait, you know what?
Screw it girl, I comin' back right now
This whole missin' you thing is now through
See ya soon
