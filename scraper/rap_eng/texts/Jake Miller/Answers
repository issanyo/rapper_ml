[Intro]
Just what is it you're looking for?
Something. When I find it, I'll know

[Verse 1]
I've been looking to the sky now
Hoping something falls down
But it's not working
I'm done searching
Life keeps switching up the program
I'm calling up my old man
'Cause I  need guidance
I can't hide this, no, no, no

[Chorus]
I'm done wasting my time
'Cause I've been losing my mind
We spend all of our lives
Trying to find the answers
God is laughing out loud
'Cause we think we got it all down
But I finally figured it out
We're never gonna find the answers

[Interlude]
I finally figured it out
We're never gonna find the answers

[Verse 2]
I ask way too many questions
I'm lost with no direction
But I'll be okay
Starting today
'Cause I'm done with overthinking
I'm smiling while I sing this
Cause I'm done chasing
And it feels amazing
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm done wasting my time
'Cause I've been losing my mind
We spend all of our lives
Trying to find the answers
God is laughing out loud
'Cause we think we got it all down
But I finally figured it out
We're never gonna find the answers

[Interlude]
We're never gonna find...
...Never gonna find the answers
I finally figured it out
We're never gonna find the answers

[Outro]
