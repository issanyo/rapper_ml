[Intro]
Yeah, I'm coming home

[Hook]
Girl I'm on my way now
I know you've been waiting on me
Just counting down the hours and days and weeks
But girl I'm coming home now and I swear to God it's true
I've been around the world but I rather be here with you (yeah, yeah)
With you, with you, with you
I'd rather be here with you, with you, with you

[Verse 1]
Uh, half way across the globe tonight
You telling me, ''Good morning'' when I'm telling you, ''Good night''
You hopping in bed, I'm hopping on another flight
Holding my boarding pass, should be holding you tight
Wish I was sitting with you, on the couch watching TV
But instead I'm in row 3CB
Face-timing, so she can see me
I'd rather have the real thing; 3D

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
Girl I know that you're all alone
And you're sick of being on your own
I can hear it through the telephone
But soon I'll be coming home
Yeah, yeah I know that you're all alone
And you're sick of being on your own
But I promise you I'm coming home
I said I promise you I'm coming home!

[Verse 2]
Uh, another day another terminal
I keep saying goodbye, it feels terrible
Seeing you cry when I leave is unbearable
But coming home to you is incomparable
Being away like this, it feels so wrong
I mean seeing your face it's been too long
But I'm amazed girl, you've been so strong
Just cause I ain't there doesn't mean that I'm gone
I'm coming home baby!

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I spend my days in hotel rooms just thinking about you
Lying in this king size bed that's really made for two
It's been a while since I've seen your face
I know sometimes it's tough
Cause soon I'm coming home to you
But soon's not soon enough

[Hook] X2

[Outro]
With you, with you, with you
Yeah, I'd rather be here with you, with you, with you
