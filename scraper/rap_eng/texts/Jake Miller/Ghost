[Bridge: Nikki Flores]
I’m just a ghost, but I’m not the only one
I guess I’m not the only one

[Verse 1: Jake Miller]
This one’s for the kids that walk around with their hoodies up
No one to talk to and on the verge of givin’ up
Same shit, different day, nothing seems to work out
Headphones on, always trying to tune the world out
And this one’s for the kids who get picked last
Yeah, so might as well just skip gym class
Why not? I bet no one would even notice
‘Cause no one really cares when you’re down, feeling hopeless
And this one’s for the kids at lunch who sit slone
So embarassed you're pretending that you’re on the phone
But then you realize that it doesn’t really help
‘Cause ain’t nobody on the line, you’re just talking to yourself

[Pre-Chorus: Jake Miller]
And it stinks, right? Yeah, I know
Sometimes it feels like you’re on your own
Trust me, you are not the only one, life has only just begun
Just remember that you’re not alone

[Chorus: Nikki Flores]
I’m just a ghost, oh-hoo (yeah)
They’re staring right at me (right at me)
Looking right past me (right past me)
I’m just a ghost, oh-hoo (yeah)
Who do I turn to (who do I turn to)
When I feel see-through? (yeah, see-through, yeah)

[Bridge: Nikki Flores]
I’m just a ghost, but I’m not the only one
I guess I’m not the only one

[Verse 2: Jake Miller]
Look, you feel invisible, but I can see you
You’re calling out, nobody’s answering, but I can hear you
They don’t like me, they don’t get me, they don’t feel my pain
But there’s a million people out there who relate to you or feel the same
Yeah, so just smile and you’ll be alright
When you’re feeling like a ghost flowing through the air
Remember stars still shine in the darkest nights
Even when you can’t see ‘em, they’re always there
Yeah, so keep your eyes up to the sky
We’re all in this together, we gon' make it if we try
It’s hard when you’re feeling like you’re lost and forgotten
You got no one around to dry your tears when you cry

[Pre-Chorus: Jake Miller]
And it stinks, right? Yeah, I know
Sometimes it feels like you’re on your own
Trust me, you are not the only one, life has only just begun
Just remember that you’re not alone

[Chorus: Nikki Flores]
I’m just a ghost, oh-hoo (yeah)
They’re staring right at me (right at me)
Looking right past me (right past me)
I’m just a ghost, oh-hoo (yeah)
Who do I turn to (who do I turn to)
When I feel see-through? (yeah)

[Verse 3: Jake Miller]
So tonight, I’ma fly up to the sky and let the whole world see me
And if you’re feeling how I’m feeling you should come along with me
This is the last time you’ll ever look past me again
I’m not a ghost, I’m more alive than I’ve ever been
And I’ma let the whole world see me
And if you’re feeling how I’m feeling you should come along with me
This is the last time you’ll ever look past me again
I’m not a ghost, I’m more alive than I’ve ever been

[Chorus: Nikki Flores]
I’m just a ghost, oh-hoo
They’re staring right at me
Looking right pass me
I’m just a ghost oh-hoo
Who do I turn to (yeah)
When I feel see-through? (come on)

[Chorus: Nikki Flores]
I’m just a ghost, oh-hoo (yeah)
They’re staring right at me (right at me)
Looking right past me (right past me)
I’m just a ghost, oh-hoo (yeah, you're not a ghost)
Who do I turn to (so keep your head up)
When I feel see-through? (and one day the whole world is gonna see you, yeah)

[Bridge: Nikki Flores]
I’m just a ghost, but I’m not the only one
I guess I’m not the only one
