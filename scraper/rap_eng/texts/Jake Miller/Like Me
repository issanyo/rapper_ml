There is no one like me
Th-th-there is no one like me, like me
Ma-ma-manners take a second look and you'll see
There is no one like me
There is no one like me, like me

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you all a story
Everybody gather round
Once there was boy
He was the coolest kid in town
He knew he wasn't perfect
Just like everybody else
But he always knew the importance of stayin true to himself
Cause all other kids
Would hide behind a mask
So when they took attendance
He the only one in class
Who could proudly raise his hand when he heard his name
Never lost track of who he was or tried to change
Even through the peer pressure he was happy in his skin
While everyone around him was obssessed with fittin in
He never let the words of others get in his way
Hey and that's what made him into the man he is today SING

[Hook]
Manners, take a second look and you'll see (you'll see)
There is no one like me (like me)
Th-th-there is no one like me (like me, l-l-l-l-like me)
Manners, you better reconsider (consider)
Cause you will never do better (do better)
There is no one like me, like me (like me, l-l-l-l-like me)
Badabababab badabababa
There is no one like me
There is-

[Verse 2]
Now his friends were dressin different
Barely recognized em
Everyday was halloween
Costume had disguised em
Girls covered in make up
To make up for the insecurities
Guys were actin tough
To make up for their immaturity
Yeah but he always followed his heart
Once he almost gave in, but knew it wouldn't be smart
Cause its hard to stay the same in a world thats always changing
But he looked around to find he was the only one remaining
And in that moment, he never felt so proud
Who wasn't just another face in the crowd
Cause he never let the thoughts of others get in his way
Hey and thats what made him into the man he is today SING

[Hook]
Manners, take a second look and you'll see (you'll see)
There is no one like me (like me)
Th-th-there is no one like me (like me, l-l-l-l-like me)
Manners, you better reconsider (consider)
Cause you will never do better (do better)
There is no one like me, like me (like me, l-l-l-l-like me)

[Bridge]
There ain't no one like me man
I hope that you can look in the mirror everyday
And say to yourself, there's no one like you
Yeah

[Hook]
Manners, take a second look and you'll see (you'll see)
There is no one like me (like me)
Th-th-there is no one like me (like me, l-l-l-l-like me)

Cause you will never do better (do better)
There is no one like me, like me (like me, l-l-l-l-like me)
