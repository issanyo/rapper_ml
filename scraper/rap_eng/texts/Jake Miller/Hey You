Hey you!
Can you tell me hows it feel
Being ordinary, I just dont see the appeal
I'd rather live a life that normal people find surreal
Cause I'm a superstar, but whatever no big deal

[Verse 1]
I'm a, lyrical mastermind, one of a kind, you'll never find
Anybody with a better flow than mine
How y'all doing ? I'm just fine
You know the name, no intro needed
Rookie in the game, but i'm undefeated
Y'all discrimized and mistreated
But now take a look at who succeeded
Don't know me ? Your girlfriend does
Y'all been wondering where I was
Well i've been on my grind because
I've been trying so hard to create a buzz
But now I have, I told you don't doubt me
None of you know a single thing about me
Except for the fact that I'm big in my county
But now I take a look at the world around me
And thinking to myself it's mine for the takin'
Full speed ahead no time for breakin'
If you're thinking I'mma quit, you're sadly mistaken
I do it for the love not the money I'm makin'
Just kidding, haven't made a buck
With a whole lot of skills and a little bit of luck
All these people looking at me like "Who's this punk ?"
I don't know, but he spits more than Donald Duck

[Verse 2]
I got the beat flowing in my viens
And it's tatooed in my brain
Restrain from my terrain while I continue to concur the game
Cause all of you rappers are one in the same
Predictable average and boring and plain
I promise that you will remember my name
And I'll make a mill call me Lil Wayne
Yeah you can't deny the way you feel inside
Man the kids got skills he'll be nationwide
In a couple of years standing side by side
With the best in the game, I'mma give it a ride
All the hype just keep on growin'
No turnin' back i'm never slowin'
So why I should not keep goin'
Somebody help me I can't stop flowin'
Since the day I put out dreamin'
Can't go out without the girls screamin'
Hop on a plane to chill with Keenan
I'm living the life and i'm only eighteen
And so you better cut the track and drop the beat
Jake Miller just killed it, you should tweet
Tell the world that the kid just can't be beat
Cause I'm driven as hell and you're in the backseat
