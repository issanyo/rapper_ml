[Verse 1]
I know sometimes you wanna go and give up
You know we only argue when I'm fucked up
So maybe we should try and kiss and make up
Or if you hate me, baby, maybe you should just leave
But I can see you saying shit you don't mean
You'll feeling better in the morning

[Chorus]
They say change takes time
But baby, we can fix it overnight
If you let me try
Then maybe we can fix it overnight, overnight
Oh, overnight

[Verse 2]
Running out of patience, we should slow down
My tongue is tied, I don't know what to say now
But we don't have to talk to work it all out
Cause once you question, burn, you burn it all down
You know it's getting late, we may as well now
Make it better by the time the sun's out

[Chorus]
They say change takes time
But baby, we can fix it overnight
If you let me try
Then maybe we can fix it overnight, overnight
Oh, overnight
Baby, we can fix it overnight

[Bridge]
Oh no, we don't have to
Give up, give up so soon
Baby, we don't have to sleep on it
Right now, let me show you
What I, what I can do
Baby, we don't have to sleep on it, baby

[Chorus]
They say change takes time
But baby, we can fix it overnight
If you let me try
Then maybe we can fix it overnight, overnight
Oh, overnight
Baby, we can fix it overnight
