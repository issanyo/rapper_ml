[Intro]
I wanna rock (rock, rock)
Rock (rock, rock)

[Verse 1]
Girl, close your eyes
Let the rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus]
I wanna rock (rock, rock) with you all night
Dance (dance, dance) 'till the sunlight
Rock (rock, rock) with you all night
We're gonna rock the night away
I wanna rock (rock, rock) with you all night
Dance (dance, dance) 'till the sunlight
Rock (rock, rock) with you all night
We're gonna rock the night away

[Verse 2]
Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
Cause we got so far to go
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus]
I wanna rock (rock, rock) with you all night
Dance (dance, dance) 'till the sunlight
Rock (rock, rock) with you all night
We're gonna rock the night away
I wanna rock (rock, rock) with you all night
Dance (dance, dance) 'till the sunlight
Rock (rock, rock) with you all night
We're gonna rock the night away

[Bridge]
And when that beat is dead and gone (Yeah)
You know that love survives
So we can rock forever

[Chorus]
I wanna rock (rock, rock) with you all night
Dance (dance, dance) 'till the sunlight
Rock (rock, rock) with you all night
We're gonna rock the night away
I wanna rock (rock, rock) with you all night
Dance (dance, dance) 'till the sunlight
Rock (rock, rock) with you all night
We're gonna rock the night away

[Outro]
Rock the night away
