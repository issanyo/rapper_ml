[Verse 1]
It's been six months since we talked at all
You asked me not to so I didn't call
Yeah, it's nice to run into you
Even though it might be too soon
'Cause it seems like you've been movin' on

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you
Know that I got someone new
So I'll try not to say your name
And I know you
Know that I got someone new
But to tell the truth, it's not the same

[Chorus]
She's just a distraction, I confess
She'll never take up the space that you left
Just a distraction, I confess
Someone to hold who can help me forget

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna go off and say too much
But it's hard not to you think 'bout the way it was
It is nice to run into you
Even though it might be too soon
'Cause she's alright, but it isn't love

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you
Know that I got someone new
So I'll try not to say your name
And I know you
Know that I got someone new
But to tell the truth, it's not the same

[Chorus]
She's just a distraction, I confess
She'll never take up the space that you left
Just a distraction, I confess
Someone to hold who can help me forget, yeah

[Bridge]
She may have my attention
But we got no connection
Just need to take my mind off you, yeah
She may have my attention
But we got no connection
Just need to take my mind off you

[Chorus]
She's just a distraction, I confess
She'll never take up the space that you left
Just a distraction, I confess
Someone to hold who can help me forget, yeah

[Outro]
She may have my attention
But we got no connection
Just need to take my mind off you, yeah
She may have my attention
But we got no connection
Just need to take my mind off you
