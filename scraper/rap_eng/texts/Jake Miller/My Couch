"My Couch"

She don't wanna go out
She'd rather chill in my house
All her friends are partying while we dinin' in watching
Netflix on my couch
She don't wanna go out
She just wanna come over, yea
Your friends are in the VIP but you don't need a ID to come
And kick it on my couch

Yea, her friends are downtown while we at the pad
Chillin home, watchin episodes of Breaking Bad
Man forget these other girls, we ain't got nothing in common
I'd rather be with you up in the kitchen makin ramen
You perfect the way are, not the type to hit the bar
Her idea of going hard, is looking through the DVR
With the sweat pants, hair tied, chillin with no makeup on
Phone's blowin' up, friends are begging you to tag along
I think they're jealous if you ask me
They'll probably go out and get drunk just like last week
Screw your friends, you can catch a broken asley
That you don't need the glitz and glamor when you have me
Cause you ain't got nothing on but my tank and your undies
So get on the floor and just tackle me, rugby
You ain't like them other girls, no you ain't the same
So baby come over, my couch is calling your name

She don't wanna go out
She'd rather chill in my house
All her friends are partying while we dinin' in watching
Netflix on my couch
She don't wanna go out
She just wanna come over, yea
Your friends are in the VIP but you don't need a ID to come
And kick it on my couch

Yea, so what you say baby? Put the recliner back
High heels, black dress, you could say goodbye to that
Could be anywhere but girl you're right here with me
So during the commercial breaks, yea we getting frisky
Ha-ha, you know the key to my heart
Ordering chinese and playing Mario Kart
You're worth more than the world to me, I ain't talkin Forbes list
You don't need to dress up, you're drop dead gorgeous
So baby just come and hang with me
Phone on silent, tell em to let us be
Your girls are takin shots in the VIP
But here in my crib all the drinks are free
So come lay in my arms, we could look up at the stars
Got my fury ugg slippers and my bowl of lucky charms
You ain't like them other girls, you ain't the same
So baby come over, my couch is calling your name

She don't wanna go out
She'd rather chill in my house
All her friends are partying while we dinin' in watching
Netflix on my couch
She don't wanna go out
She just wanna come over, yea
Your friends are in the VIP but you don't need a ID to come
And kick it on my couch

[x2:]
You ain't like them other girls
You-ain't-like-them-other-girls
You ain't like them girls
So baby come over, my couch is calling your name

[x2:]
She don't wanna go out

All her friends are partying while we dinin' in watching
