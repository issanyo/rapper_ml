[Verse 1: Jake Miller]
Yeah now I'm rocking with the best, pass me the mic and turn me up
Bound to blow any moment now, I'm bound to self destruct
Man I'm just a normal dude with far from normal dreams
Doing donuts in the whip, I ain't talking Krispy Kreme
So sit back and watch me kill it, a dynasty rebuilding
We taking over the world, yeah I know you feel it
Man this life I live is crazy, and maybe a little chaotic
But I'm living out my dream even though my dream's psychotic
Cause, ain't nobody ever really do it like me
Come and take a walk in my shoes, you'll see
I never show no mercy I torture the mic and murder the beat
I shut it down in your city
Windows down when you bump this
I'm circling around the map like Christopher Columbus
Man, I'm crossing off my bucket list
Soon I'mma need another one and when I'm done
I might just do them all again, just for fun
We pour it up, pour it up
Then me and my team we down them
We 'bout to change the world
If your looking for the best I found them
Baby lets go

[Verse 2: Hi-Rez]
Risking everything for everything
Gotta go to hell to make your way to heaven
I'm married to the game but I never had a wedding
I'm more of a menace than Dennis, i'm independent
Messing with the great whites, working late nights
Little recognition, that takes time
I make rhymes, never waste time
I found my dreams, and I chase mine
I've been up, I've been down
Beat the competition like Chris Brown
Don't close your eyes you'll miss out on me
Making it, my momma been proud
I never lie, but I'm just the truth
Killing tracks when I'm in the booth
They say rap is dead, rap is dead
But I disagree cause I'm breathing proof
Better hide your girl when I'm in the room
Cause I'll make her mine and I'll be the groom
I'mma need a broom to clean up the game
Cause everybody nowadays care about the fame
I'm on one, I'm the real deal
My music help me to pay bills
So hungry I could eat eight meals
I'll never know how being fake feels
I've seen debt but I'm still blessed
No bath salts but I eat flesh
I'm so fresh, I get no rest
I'm grinding to make progress
Your rap is whack, where the passion at?
You're blowing up, man there's not a chance
You got a bit of chance, got a beat and check
Been around the world, I've been there and back

[Verse 3: Jake Miller]
I'm a lyrical mastermind, one of a kind, you'll never find
Anybody with a -- wait hold up, cut the track and rewind
Baby, everyday is a party, sometimes I think I'm tripping
Just trynna keep my head from getting big like Stewie Griffin
Man, I'm married to the game, holy matrimony
You say that you going HAM? Best believe I go bologna
Cause if you ain't heard of me, then I think we need to talk
Man, I bet you live with Patrick cause you living under a rock
Cause, ain't nobody ever really gonna do it like me
Come and take a walk in my shoes, you'll see
I never show no mercy, I torture the mic and murder the beat
I walk around my city feeling like a mayor
I'm worldwide baby, just like the equator
Man, I'm living like I'm dying, but I haven't even hit 20
I'm living like a millionaire but I barely made a penny
I'll take a break when I die, no stopping by any means
Cause what's the point of sleeping, when you're living your dreams
