I would never try to tame you and your lion heart
Promise me you'll never change
I'm wild for the way you are
And when we touch it makes me feel love in a stolen car
So i will never try to thame you
You and your lion heart
You and your lion heart
You and your lion heart
Ooh ooh ooh uohh
Ooh ooh ooh uohh

The will never understand you and your lion heart
Yeah I'm the only one who can love you the way you are
So tear me up and set me free
We'll run underneath the stars
I swear that I will never leave
You and your lion heart
Ooh ooh ooh uohh
Ooh ooh ooh uohh

Yeah girl you're crazy
And i love it
This others dudes they don't cut it
They can't handle the fact you walk your own path
But me can't get enough of it
Cause you're wild but me too
So it's good just come through
I can show you the night of your life
Girl we can turn our hole world into a zoo

Yeah
So baby let me hear your roar
Compounds on me like never before
You are the queen of the jungle
I can be the king
I am right here, you ain't got to worry about a thing
You will never go in hungry, I'll fight for you
Nothing will frighten you, cause every night for you
I could be your light when the stars get dark
I love you and your lion heart!

I could be your light when the sky gets dark
I love you and your lion heart
I would never try to tame you and your lion heart
Promise me you'll never change
I'm wild for the way you are
And when we touch it makes me feel love
So i will never try to thame you
You and your lion heart
