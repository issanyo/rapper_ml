[Verse 1: Jake Miller & Clara Mae]
You say my head's not in it
Can't take another minute
That's so typical
That's so typical, you
Leaving the sheets so messed up
Chaos Or Love Just like us
That's so typical
So damn typical

[Pre-Chorus: Jake Miller & Clara Mae]
Slam the door in my face and then threaten to leave me
You stay out for a while but you're back in the evening
The way you just shake it off
Like you don't care that much
Making up once again, and we're on
And we're even

[Chorus: Clara Mae & Jake Miller]
I might leave to be someone for somebody else
All the things we left undone
So full of ourselves
I might leave to be someone for somebody else
So scared we'll find anew
A better me, a better you
A better me, a better you
A better me, a better you

[Verse 2: Jake Miller & Clara Mae]
Your mood is like sudden thunder
From nowhere a perfect summer
That's so typical
Yeah, that's so typical, you
Talk about your ambitions
Dream for a while and ditch them
That's so typical
So damn typical

[Pre-Chorus: Jake Miller & Clara Mae]
Slam the door in my face and then threaten to leave me
You stay out for a while but you're back in the evening
The way you just shake it off
Like you don't care that much
Making up once again, and we're on
And we're even

[Chorus: Clara Mae & Jake Miller]
I might leave to be someone for somebody else
All the things we left undone
So full of ourselves
I might leave to be someone for somebody else
So scared we'll find anew
A better me, a better you
A better me, a better you
A better me, a better you

[Bridge: Clara Mae & Jake Miller]
I'm afraid to let go, we got everything to lose
Wonder if it is so, scared that we will find anew
Both afraid to let go, we've got everything to lose
Wonder if it is so, scared that we will find anew
A better me a better you

[Chorus: Clara Mae & Jake Miller]
I might leave to be someone for somebody else
All the things we left undone
So full of ourselves
I might leave to be someone for somebody else
So scared we'll find anew
A better me, a better you
A better me, a better you
A better me, a better you
A better me, a better you
