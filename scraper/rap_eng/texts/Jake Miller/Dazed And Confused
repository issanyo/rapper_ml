[Intro]
Ba da ba da ba da
Ba da ba da
Got me feeling like
Ba da ba da ba da
(Yeah!)
Ba da ba da ba da

[Verse 1: Jake Miller]
Look, girl, you got me faded
Like I downed the whole bottle
Yeah, you walked in the room
Looking like a Victoria's Secret model
Throw your number in my iPhone
And then let me take you home
I swear I think I fell in love
Either that or my drink's too strong

[Chorus: Jake Miller]
Took a walk on the clouds
Fell asleep on the moon
And I'm not coming down now that I'm with you
If we ever wake up
Don't know what I would do
Are we really in love or dazed and confused?

[Post-Chorus: Jake Miller]
Ba da ba da ba da
Ba da ba da
Got me feeling like
Ba da ba da ba da
Ba da ba da ba da

[Verse 2: Jake Miller]
Yeah you taking selfies with your girls
And dancing with your ass out
The way your drop it down low
I swear got me 'bout to pass out
Feeling tipsy everytime you kiss me
Girl, you got me high
Yeah, this love we got is trippy
But it's all good
We just dazed and confused
Wake up in the morning
What the hell do we do?

[Chorus: Jake Miller]
Took a walk on the clouds
Fell asleep on the moon
And I'm not coming down now that I'm with you
If we ever wake up
Don't know what I would do
Are we really in love or dazed and confused?

Ba da ba da ba da
Ba da ba da
Got me feeling like
Ba da ba da ba da
Ba da ba da ba da

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]
Yeah! It's Travie
OK
Aight here's how it's goin' down
You me and your homegirl
Can get a little freaky in my hotel
Just don't let me catch up being sneaky with your phone, girl
This a quick way to get dismissed
Now I hope we on the same page
But that's what I love about college chicks
I keep gettin' older and they stay the same age
Now turn around let me get a peek
Good Lord, that's a miracle
But don't get too geek (nope)
Feel them sheets that's not boyfriend material
She got a body like mhmm
And a face like ehh
I got one head saying mmh-mmh
And the other one saying yes

[Chorus: Jake Miller]
Took a walk on the clouds
Fell asleep on the moon
And I'm not coming down now that I'm with you
If we ever wake up
Don't know what I would do
Are we really in love or dazed and confused?

[Outro]
Ba da ba da ba da
Ba da ba da
Got me feeling like
Ba da ba da ba da
Dazed and confused
Ba da ba da ba da
Ba da ba da'
Got me feeling like
Ba da ba da ba da
Ba da ba da ba da
