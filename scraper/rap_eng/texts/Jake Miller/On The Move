[Intro]
Yeah, haha, we going old school on this one
Let's go

[Hook: Jake Miller (McFadden and WhiteHead)] (x2)
(Ain't no stopping us now, we're on the move)
Yeah, I'm on the move
You can hear me on the radio or watch me on the news, like
(Ain't no stopping us now, we're on the move)
Yeah, I'm on the move
All these labels wanna sign me, I don't know which one to choose

[Verse 1]
Ayo, I'm always on the move, something different everyday
Tonight I'm on the news, after that I'm on my way
To Power 96 cause they say they wanna play
My newest track that I finished earlier today
Upgraded from a dorm to a hotel suite
No more sitting in class, I'm in the first class seat
Flying to the city, all these labels wanna meet
With the kid that everybody's trynna sign like a receipt
I'm the hip hop Bill Nye, always in the lab
Mind's so sharp that my brain got stabbed
Phone's blowing up, think I just got tagged
Oh wait, it's just another kid who wants to collab
Got photoshoots and interviews literally everyday
Nothing that I haven't done, you can check the resume
These the memories that nobody could take away
And now my name's getting out, double play

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I'm always on the move, going here and there
People see me out in public and they stop and stare
I'm taking the cards life deals me, solitare
And I'mma win every hand 'till I'm a millionaire
Putting college on hold, people trynna ask why
I'm making the most out of life, that's why
Plus I'd rather be a star than a frat guy
And work hard to get bigger than a fat guy
A couple months ago, I was a no name
Used to stalk celebrities at the Heat game
Gave my mixtape to Chris Brown, and Mack Maine
To Rick Ross, and Khaled, and Weezy, and T-Pain
Now the labels that they signed to
Are calling me back saying, "we wanna sign you"
Kids that used to hate saying, "I'm behind you"
And now they telling me I'm sicker than the swine flu

[Hook] (x3)
