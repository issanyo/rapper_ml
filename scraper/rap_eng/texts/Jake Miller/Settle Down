[Hook]
I wanna settle down
I wanna settle down
Won't you settle down with me, settle down
We can settle at a table (Yeah)
A table for two (Jake Miller)
Won't you wine and dine with me (Rez, we bout to do it again, man)
Settle down

[Verse 1: Jake Miller]
Ha ha, hey
She tellin' me to settle down, baby I got bigger plans
I'm tryna tour the world, while shes makin' dinner plans
I'd love to stick around, but I can't waste time
So I told her after my show, we can Face Time
I feel my phone buzzin' while I'm doing sound check
Gotta take a rain check, so I can make a paycheck
She always tellin' me, I don't know where to draw the line
Missin' calls all the time, always gotta hit decline
She told me hit the brakes, she dont like the new me
Won't come on the road with me, cause that makes her a groupie
All she wanna do is get some dinner and a movie
But I'm just tryin' make it, you dont like it, baby, sue me
She said, "I'm sick of it, honestly i've had it
Why dont you go try to win the lotto while your at it?
Your chasin' a kid's dream, its time for you to grow up"
But I ain't got the time to settle down, I'm tryin' blow up

[Hook]
I wanna settle down
I wanna settle down
Won't you settle down with me, settle down
We can settle at a table
A table for two
Won't you wine and dine with me
Settle down

[Verse 2: Hi-Rez]
Yeah Yeah, Uh Uh, Hey Hey
She gettin' high, gettin' high to ignore frustration
She act like she all for it, but secretly she hate it
Borderline suicidal, what the f*ck could I do
In another state, and expectin' me to ride through
And drop what I'm doin', now my day is brewin'
Under the influence of love, I can't do this
I think I'm bout to lose it, I ain't tryna settle down
Always hittin' on my cell, it's hella hard to get around
Sayin' we should test it out, emotions, gotta let it out
Always arguing about, how my head up in the clouds
And you got me blowin' now, to run away from these problems
You always cause a racket, not talkin' Andy Roddick
Music my first love, and i'll never put it second
No that's not even a question, headed in the right direction
And I think you slow me down, I need to get out this town
(Baby can we settle down?)
Hell nah, are you for real?!

[Hook]
I wanna settle down
I wanna settle down
Won't you settle down with me, settle down
We can settle at a table
A table for two
Won't you wine and dine with me
Settle down

[Verse 3: Jake Miller]
(Clears throat) Uh, Yeah
Now she tryna text me, call me, skype me
But I ain't got the time, I know how to tell her politely
Yeah I know you're missing me
Baby girl, I get it
But I'm just tryna live my dream, can't you give me credit?
You said you're missing my voice, well then turn on your radio
She said, "I'm sick and tired of blowing kisses through my stereo"
Beggin' me to meet her, while I'm 30,000 feet up
I got too much on my plate, ha, I'm tryna eat up
Water works every time I cancel reservations
Messing with her heart like I'm playin' operation
Tellin' me, "I wish you had a normal ocupation"
But I'm on my grind, tryna get a grammy nomination
Now your givin' ultimatums, either music or you
Is it too much to ask to have my cake and eat it too
"Your chasin' a kid's dream, its time for you to grow up"
But I ain't got the time to settle down, I'm tryin' blow up

[Hook]
I wanna settle down
I wanna settle down
Won't you settle down with me, settle down
We can settle at a table
A table for two
Won't you wine and dine with me
Settle down
