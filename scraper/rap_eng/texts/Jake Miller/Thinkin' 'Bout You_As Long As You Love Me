[Intro]
Yeah (yeah)

[Verse 1]
A tornado flew around my room, before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it us-ually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but girl they bawl

[Hook]
When I'm thinkin' 'bout ya'
Oh, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout ya'
You know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout ya'
Do you think about me still?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Look, I don't know if this makes sense but
You're my hallelujah (you're my hallelujah)
Yeah, uh, give me a time and place and I'll rendezvous
I'll fly you to it, I'll beat you there
Girl, you know I got you
Us, trust, a couple things that I just can't spell without you
Now we on top of the world
Cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
Man we steppin' out like, ''Woah''
Cameras point and shoot
Ask me what's my best side and I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But that grass ain't always greener on the other side, it's green where you water it
So, I know, we got issues baby, true, true, true
But I rather work on this with you than to go ahead and start with someone new

[Hook]
Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout ya'
Oh, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout ya'
You know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout ya'
Do you think about me still?
Yeah
