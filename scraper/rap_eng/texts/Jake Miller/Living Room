[Verse 1]
No cars, no job, no money
But somehow, we still felt lucky
We were running fast without looking both ways
We were younger than, take me back to the days

[Pre-Chorus]
When we used to get high in your living room
Felt like the world stopped, when I looked at you
And we would have to hide our bloodshot eyes
Every time your mom came home at night
Cause we used to get high in your living room

[Chorus]
(we can blow up)
(we used to get high in your living room)
We used to get high
(we used to get high in your living room)
We used to get high
And we would have to hide our blood shoot eyes
Every time your mom came home at night
(we used to get high in your living room)

[Verse 2]
9th grade, we start fallin'
We had what they all wanted
We were hiding in your bed and skipping class
Tell me how the hell did we grow up so fast

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause we used to get high in your living room
Felt like the world stopped, when I looked at you
And we would have to hide our bloodshot eyes
Every time your mom came home at night
Cause we used to get high in your living room

[Chorus]
(we can blow up)
(we used to get high in your living room)
We used to get high
(we used to get high in your living room)
We used to get high
And we would have to hide our bloodshot eyes
Every time your mom came home at night
(we used to get high in your living room)

[Verse 3] (Caleb Shapiro from Timeflies)
We never complicate things get lost and play games
No coppin' brand names
Just compensatin'
For Brown to Dwyane Wade
Your boy was self made, we l-l-love
And hate the same things
But you know, I know
Things switch up
When did we go, so different
We don't take Ls, we bake Ls
We go back, like bake sales
Now I'm out, and hotels and nowhere
I'm missing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause we used to get high in your living room
Felt like the world stopped, when I looked at you
And we would have to hide our blood shoot eyes
Every time your mom came home at night
Cause we used to get high in your living room

[Chorus]
(we can blow up)
(we used to get high in your living room)
We used to get high
(we used to get high in your living room)
We used to get high
And we would have to hide our bloodshot eyes
Every time your mom came home at night
(we used to get high in your living room)
