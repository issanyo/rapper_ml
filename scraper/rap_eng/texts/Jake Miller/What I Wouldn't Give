[Intro]
Yeah, Jake Miller, ha ha

[Verse 1]
Uh, uh
Growin' up I used to dream about the life
I mean, literally, I dreamed about it every night
Man, what I would do just to live it for a day or two
Now it's same stage, different view, lookin' down at you
They say I rhyme tight, now I'm in the limelight
Feelin' high as ever, I'm livin' the Miller High Life
So turn it loud, I'm addicted to the crowd
They say the sky's the limit but my head's up in the clouds, I'm

[Bridge]
Feelin' good now, you'll never break me
Maybe I'm dreamin', if I am don't wake me
I want it all cause I only got one life to live
And I'mma get it cause there's nothin' that I wouldn't give!

[Hook]
Yeah, what I wouldn't give for the glory
What I wouldn't give for the flashing lights
What I wouldn't give for the stories
From a different city every night
We live, we love, I'll be a star, a star
We laugh and lookin' back we've come so far, so far

[Verse 2]
I see my name in lights now
I'm livin' for right now
Makin' so much noise, neighbors tellin' me to pipe down
Around the glove different city every day
I'm packin' out arenas, seems like it was yesterday that I was
Buyin' tickets to my favorite shows
Always sittin' first row and when the curtains would close
I would sneak backstage just so I could feel the thrill
But it was a temporary high because I wanted it for real, but I'm

[Bridge]
Feelin' good now, you'll never break me
Maybe I'm dreamin', if I am don't wake me
I want it all cause I only got one life to live
And I'mma get it cause there's nothin' that I wouldn't give!

[Hook]
Yeah, what I wouldn't give for the glory
What I wouldn't give for the flashing lights
What I wouldn't give for the stories
From a different city every night
We live, we love, I'll be a star, a star
We laugh and lookin' back we've come so far, so far

[Verse 3]
I was just a kid with a dream (with a dream)
Dying just to hear them scream (hear 'em scream)
My name, my name, my name
Oh, oh, oh
Now I'm wakin' up every mornin' (every mornin'!)
Runnin' out to deal with the fortune (with the fortune)
And fame, and fame, and fame
Let's go!

[Hook]
Yeah, what I wouldn't give for the glory
What I wouldn't give for the flashing lights
What I wouldn't give for the stories
From a different city every night
We live, we love, I'll be a star, a star
We laugh and lookin' back we've come so far, so far (2x)
