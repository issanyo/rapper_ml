[Verse One]
The used to say I'd never make it
And that's the reason that I will
And I ain't being cocky, I'm just tryna keep it real
As a kid I used to wonder how a million dollars feel
Now it's 30 shows a month, signing million dollar deals
All these dreams I was chasing, started in my basement
Now I'm on the road, killin shows around the nation
People used to doubt me, now they're slowly changing
I put em in their place like a real estate agent
Ha-ha, man it's crazy how we came up
A year ago these people let it go and look my name up
Yea I got a dream, best believe that I'll pursue it
I swear I'll be the best to ever do it

[Chorus]
Cause I'll be number one, one day
No, I don't wanna be forgotten
I'll be at the top, someday
Number two's just not an option
So everybody watch me, you know how I do
Yea I'm feeling good now, tell me how are you
I be living life with my whole damn crew
Cause the number one rule is never be number two, number two hey!

[Verse Two]
Yea, I'm the man around my city
I'm taking over the world, got the Millertary with me
Yea we started from the bottom, now we worldwide known man
I'm famous on the internet, my rims are Google Chrome yeah
I'm all over the web baby, you can call me Charlotte
20k a night, man I used to shop at Target
Shutting down your city, the second I arrive
Like, hey, aren't you that rapper kid that sings 'A Million Lives?
All these cameras get to flashing when I'm out in public
I came a long way from bagging groceries at Publix
But I was dreaming big so I had to go pursue it
I swear I'll be the best to ever do it

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I won't stop til I'm the best
And I'll never settle for anything less
I won't stop til I'm the best, til I'm the best
And I'll never settle for anything less
I won't stop til I'm the best, til I'm the best
And I'll never settle for anything less
I won't stop til I'm the best, til I'm the best
And I'll never settle for anything less

[Chorus] x2
