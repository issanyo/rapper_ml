[Verse 1]
Driving with nowhere to go
Midnight and I'm on my own
I'm talking to myself
I'm talking to myself again


Headlights shining on the road
Pitch black but so beautiful
Got a long way to go but I know
I'll make it to the end and I'ma be alright

[Chorus]
When you feel like you've lost your way
When you've seen every shade of gray
Just know that everything will be
Everything will be alright
And when you're so far away from home
When you're scared and you're all alone
Just know that everything will be
Everything will be alright

[Verse 2]
Long as I'm still alive
I'm still young, only 25
I got a couple friends
And my family, that's all I need
Yeah

'Cause life's short, I'ma live it right
And smile through all the darkest nights
I still got my faith and my love
And I still got me, so we gon' be alright

[Chorus]
When you feel like you've lost your way
When you've seen every shade of gray
Just know that everything will be
Everything will be alright
And when you're so far away from home
When you're scared and you're all alone
Just know that everything will be
Everything will be alright

[Outro]
We will be alright
Yeah we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Yeah, yeah
Everything will be
Everything will be alright
