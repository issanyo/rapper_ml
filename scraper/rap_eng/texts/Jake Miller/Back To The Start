[Pre-Chorus]
Let's take it back to the start
When we were just kids in love
Do you remember back in the start
Before we started growin' up

[Chorus]
I wish we could go back, back, back to the start
When the whole world was ours
I wish we could go back, back, back to the start
When the whole world was ours
Let's take it back to the start
When we were just kids in love

[Verse 1]
Young and so blind, yeah we were runnin' on cloud nine
So in love, we were so high
I wish that we could relive those nights
Yeah, I wish we could take it back, back, back to the start
Hit the reset, bring it back to the sparks
Back to the days we would drive to the park
Hookin' up all night in the back of my car
Yeah with my hands on your hips
Only seventeen never felt like this
Had you in my arms thinkin' "man this is it"
I wish we could take it all back

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's take it back to the start
When we were just kids in love
Do you remember back in the start
Before we started growin' up

[Chorus]
I wish we could go back, back, back to the start
When the whole world was ours
I wish we could go back, back, back to the start
When the whole world was ours
Let's take it back to the start
When we were just kids in love

[Verse 2]
Now you're grown, and you are all I know
What a long bumpy road
Oh, but I'd walk it all again with you
Yeah said I'd walk it all again with you, girl
Before the bullshit, before the long nights
Before we knew anything bout the real life
Bout the real world and the struggle
Back to the days that we lived in a bubble
Everything was all good, we were killin' it
Holdin' hands like "damn we legitimate"
So naive, so innocent
I wish that we could take it all back

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's take it back to the start
When we were just kids in love
Do you remember back in the start
Before we started growin' up

[Chorus]
I wish we could go back, back, back to the start
When the whole world was ours
I wish we could go back, back, back to the start
When the whole world was ours
Let's take it back to the start
When we were just kids in love

[Verse 3]
Do you ever wish we could rewind?
Yeah I dream about it sometimes
I miss what we were back then
But maybe if we try we could find it again
I remember how it felt on our first date
Remember why we fell in love in the first place
I believe in a love like this
And I know we can take it all back

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's take it back to the start
When we were just kids in love
Do you remember back in the start
Before we started growin' up

[Chorus]
I wish we could go back, back, back to the start
When the whole world was ours
I wish we could go back, back, back to the start
When the whole world was ours
Let's take it back to the start
When we were just kids in love
