[Verse 1]
Yeah
Been a while since I've seen you
I remember that perfume
We've been so distant
But we're never through, no
Six shots and I'm faded
You've got a new tattoo
Fallin' back in old habits
'Cause that's what we do

[Chorus]
I shoulda said no when you asked for more
But I like when your clothes are scattered on my floor
No I, I can't help myself
I shoulda went home but I'm at your door
'Cause I can't let go of what we had before
No I, I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself

[Verse 2]
Fades off, let me kiss you
One touch and we bounce right back
It's too hard to resist you
When you fuck like that, yeah
My friends say that you're deadly
Your lipstick's like cocaine
But I'm back in your bed now
'Cause I love the taste

[Chorus]
I shoulda said no when you asked for more
But I like when your clothes are scattered on my floor
No I, I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I shoulda went home but I'm at your door
'Cause I can't let go of what we had before, Oh No
No I, I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself

[Bridge]
I shoulda said no when you asked for more
But I like when your clothes are scattered on my floor
No I, I can't help myself
I shoulda went home but I'm at your door
'Cause I can't let go of what we had before, before
No I, I can't help myself
I can't help myself, Self oh yeah yeah

[Outro]
No I can't, I can't
I can't help myself
No I can't, I can't
I can't help myself
