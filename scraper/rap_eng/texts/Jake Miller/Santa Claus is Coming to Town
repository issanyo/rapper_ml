[Intro: Joe Jonas]
I think you know the words
Sing along with us please

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
You better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 2: Daya]
He's making a list
And checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Sing it Charlie!

[Verse 3: Charlie Puth]
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
Better be good for goodness sake!

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
O! You better watch out!
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why

[Chorus: All]
Santa Claus is coming to town (oh yeah)
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 4: Joe Jonas & JOE JONAS and CHARLIE PUTH]
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
SO YOU BETTER BE GOOD FOR GOODNESS SAKE!

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
You better watch out!
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why

[Chorus: All]
Santa Claus is coming to town (oh yeah)
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming to town
