[Hook:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I won’t never let you go
You ain’t gotta worry ’bout a thing baby
Every single day Ima let you know
Oh baby can’t you see, you’re the one for me
I won’t never let you go
You ain’t gotta worry ’bout a thing baby
Every single day Ima let you know, oh, oh
You’re my everything

[Verse 1:]
It started back in middle school
Back when it was puppy love
Now it’s so much more than that
It’s something I’ve been dreaming of
It’s crazy looking back, thinking ’bout when we were kids
But it’s funny cause my feelings for you haven’t changed a bit
I remember growing up, looking at my mom and dad
Thinking when I’m older, that’s exactly what I wanna have
And I think I finally found it, ever since the day you came along
I never doubted us, I swear I knew it early on
Baby you my best friend, yeah I hope you know
We’ll go down together just like dominoes
They say there’s no such thing as fairy tales
But this seems to be!
Girl I couldn’t tell you what you mean to me

[Hook:]
I won’t never let you go
You ain’t gotta worry ’bout a thing baby
Every single day Ima let you know
Oh baby can’t you see, you’re the one for me
I won’t never let you go
You ain’t gotta worry ’bout a thing baby
Every single day Ima let you know, oh, oh
You’re my everything

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, remember laying on my roof, looking at the stars
I pointed to the biggest one and said that one is ours
You ain’t just a random girl, neah, we go way back
Always doing laps around my mind, like a race track
I been chasing after you ever since I was five foot
Circling your picture with a sharpie in my yearbook
That might of sounded kinda creepy, yeah it’s cheesy, but it’s true girl
I swear that you complete me
Cause you everything I want and more, never felt like this before
Looking in your eyes sends chills down my spinal cord
I can only ṗray to God you feel the same
Yeah, girl I love you, that will never change

[Hook:]
I won’t never let you go
You ain’t gotta worry ’bout a thing baby
Every single day Ima let you know
Oh baby can’t you see, you’re the one for me
I won’t never let you go
You ain’t gotta worry ’bout a thing baby
Every single day Ima let you know, oh, oh

I won’t never let you go
You ain’t gotta worry ’bout a thing baby
Every single day Ima let you know
Oh baby can’t you see, you’re the one for me
I won’t never let you go
You ain’t gotta worry ’bout a thing baby
Every single day Ima let you know, oh, oh

I won’t never let you go
You ain’t gotta worry ’bout a thing baby
Every single day Ima let you know
Oh baby can’t you see, you’re the one for me
I won’t never let you go
You ain’t gotta worry ’bout a thing baby
Every single day Ima let you know, oh, oh
You’re my everything
