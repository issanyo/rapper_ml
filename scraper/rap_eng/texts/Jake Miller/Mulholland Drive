[Verse 1]
Sun's coming up
And we're both still drunk
You work at nine
But for now you're mine
Parked on the side
Of Mulholland Drive
Just you and I
And these city lights

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah-ooh, your hands all over me
Ah-ooh, I got nowhere to be, oh no
Ooh, I might just lose my Keys
'Cause I don't ever wanna leave

[Chorus]
'Cause I just need
A little more time with you
Just stay awhile
I promise I can prove
That I can make
All your wildest dreams come true
But I just need
A little more time with you
A little more time with you
A little more time with you

[Verse 2]
Back in my car
You're wrapped in my arms
Got the windows down
And the music loud
Oh no we can't go home yet
With words left unsaid
It's just me and you
And one thing left to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah-ooh, your hands all over me
Ah-ooh, I got nowhere to be, oh no
Ooh, I might just lose my Keys
'Cause I don't ever wanna leave

[Chorus]
'Cause I just need
A little more time with you
Just stay awhile
I promise I can prove
That I can make
All your wildest dreams come true
But I just need
A little more time with you
A little more time.........
A little more time with you
A little more time with you

[Bridge]
Why do good things always
Have to come to an end
We can run, run away
Run as fast as we can
Not all good things always
Have to come to an end
We can run, run away
Run as fast we can

[Chorus]
'Cause I just need
A little more time with you
Just stay awhile
I promise I can prove
That I can make
All your wildest dreams come true
But I just need
A little more time with you
A little more time with you
A little more time with you
