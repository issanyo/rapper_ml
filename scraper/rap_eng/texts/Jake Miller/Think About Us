[Verse 1]
Don't know what to say
I keep calling her your name
Oh I, oh I...
Just saw all your friends
Now I'm missing you again
Oh I, oh I...
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't help but call you up when I'm wasted
I can recall what you look like naked
Give me your love, it's hard to replace it now

[Chorus]
'Cause even though I'm doing
My best at moving on
I think about us sometimes
I think about us sometimes
I feel you're getting closer
Even though you're gone
I think about us sometimes
Do you think about us sometimes?
I think about us sometimes
I think about us

[Verse 2]
You might be surprised
Just how much I fantasize
Oh I, oh I...
You might be my ex
But you just might be my next
Oh I, oh I...
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't help but call you up when I'm wasted
I can recall what you look like naked
Give me your love, it's hard to replace it now

[Chorus]
'Cause even though I'm doing
My best at moving on
I think about us sometimes
I think about us sometimes
I feel you're getting closer
Even though you're gone
I think about us sometimes
Do you think about us sometimes?

[Bridge]
Everywhere I go, I swear
I keep seeing your face
And my heart still breaks a little
Every time I hear your name
Everywhere I go I swear
I keep seeing your face
And my heart still breaks a little
Every time I hear your name

[Chorus]
'Cause even though I'm doing
My best at moving on
I think about us sometimes
I think about us sometimes
I feel you're getting closer
Even though you're gone
I think about us sometimes
Do you think about us sometimes?
Everywhere I go, I swear
I keep seeing your face
(I think about us sometimes)
And my heart still breaks a little
(I think about us sometimes)
Every time I hear your name
Everywhere I go, I swear
I keep seeing your face
(I think about us sometimes)
And my heart still breaks a little
Every time I hear your name
