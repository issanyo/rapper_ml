[Verse 1]
I’m falling out of the sky
I feel so alive
My heart ignites
When our eyes collide (ohh, yeah)
Collide (ohh, yeah)
Collide (yeah)

Don’t hold back
Crash into me
We catchin' fire
Like a third degree
Need someone to hold
Sick of being alone
So I’m rounding third and coming home
Cause I need your touch
And I need it now
We can go to lunch
And then mess around
So baby if you’re with it
You can come and get it
We could build an empire in a New York minute

[Hook]
Me and you stoppin’ time
All of the stars align
This is what it feels like..like...like
When we collide
When we collide
When we collide

[Verse 2]
I’m falling out of the sky
I feel so alive
My heart ignites
When our eyes collide (ohh, yeah)
Collide (ohh, yeah)
Collide

I’m gone
Hungover
I’m love drunk
Not sober
Yeah, it’s do or die
Baby you and I
We should get just a little bit closer
So baby come and hop up in my Range serve
These other girls kick em to the side Curb
Your love rains down
Like a meteor shower
That’s crashing down on earth
Woah

[Hook]
Me and you stoppin’ time
All of the stars align
This is what it feels like..like...like
When we collide
When we collide
When we collide

[Outro]
Me and you stoppin’ time
All of the stars align
This is what it feels like
Me and you stoppin’ time
All of the stars align
This is what it feels like..like...like
When we collide
When we collide
When we collide
When we collide
When we collide
