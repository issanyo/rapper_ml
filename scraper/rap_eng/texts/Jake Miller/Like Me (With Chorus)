[Verse 1: Jake Miller]
Let me tell you all a story
Everybody gather round
Once there was a boy
He was the coolest kid in town
He knew he wasn't perfect
Just like everybody else
But he always knew the importance of staying true to himself
Cuz all the other kids
Would hide behind a mask
So when they took attendance he the only one in class
He could probably raise his hand when he heard his name
He never lost track of who he was or tried to change
Even through the peer pressure he was happy in his skin
When everyone around his was obsessed with fitting in
He never let the words of others get in his way (hey)
And thats what made him in to the man he is today (sing)

[Hook]
Cuz take a second look and you'll see
There is no one like me
There is no one like me
Like me
There is no one like me (like me la la la la like me)
Bu bu because, you better reconsider, (consider)
You will never do better (do better)
There is no one like me (like me la la la la like me)

[Verse 2: Jake Miller]
Yeah
Haha uh
Now his friends are dressing different
Barely recogonize 'em
Everyday was halloween
Costume that disguised em
Girls covered in make up to make up for their insecurities
Guys were acting tough to make up for their immaturity
Yeah, but he always followed his heart
Once he almost gave in but he knew it wouldn't be smart
Cuz its hard to stay the same, in a word thats always changing
He looked around to find he was the only one remaining
And in that moment, he never felt so proud
He knew he wasn't just another face in the croud
He never let the thoughts of others get in his way, (hey)
And thats what made him into the man he is today, (sing)

[Hook] x 2
Cuz take a second look and you'll see
There is no one like me
There is no one like me
Like me
There is no one like me (like me la la la la like me)
Bu bu because, you better reconsider, (consider)
You will never do better (do better)
There is no one like me (like me la la la la like me)
