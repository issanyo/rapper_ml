[Intro]
Wasting, wasting
Waiting up on you, on you
Pacing, pacing
Said you're coming through
Oh, why

[Verse 1]
You can just call me up
Whenever you want love
Don't need no invitation
'Cause I know just what you want
Don't be feeling [?]
No need to complicate it

[Chorus]
'Cause we are both alone tonight
Won't tell no one, just come hit and run
'Cause they don't need to know tonight
If you want some love then come hit and run

[Verse 2]
Tension, I'm guessing
That you feel it too, oh yeah
Questions, we can answer
In my room, oh
You can just call me up
Whenever you want love
Don't need no invitation
'Cause I know just what you want
Don't be feeling [?]
No need to complicate it

[Chorus]
'Cause we are both alone tonight
Won't tell no one, just come hit and run
'Cause they don't need to know tonight
If you want some love then come hit and run

[Bridge]
'Cause I don't want to sleep alone tonight
I need your here, I need you here
I don't want to sleep alone tonight
I need your here, I need you here

[Chorus]
'Cause we are both alone tonight
Won't tell no one, just come hit and run
'Cause they don't need to know tonight
If you want some love then come hit and run

[Outro]
I need you here
Come hit and run
I need you baby
Come hit and run
