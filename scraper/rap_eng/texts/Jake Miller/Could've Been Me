[Verse 1]
This love's one-sided
And I'm undecided if it's working
Shit ain't working
And I'm in too deep
Up shits creek, can't even, tried it
I'm still fighting

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, the way you had a hand
Damn near drove me crazy, drove me crazy
And oh, time that we spent didn't make sense
You still had it, you still had it

[Chorus]
It could've been me, yeah, holding your hand
It could've been me, yeah, meeting your dad
It could've been me, I'm long gone in love
I'm all gone in love, oh
It could've been me
It could've been me
It could've been me
It could've been me

[Verse 2]
Your love's so inviting, so enticing
I couldn't fight it, I couldn't fight it
And I was in too deep
When you looked at me, I could tell that you liked it
Tell that you liked it

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, the way you had a hand
Damn near drove me crazy, drove me crazy
And oh, time that we spent didn't make sense
You still had it, you still had it

[Chorus]
It could've been me, yeah, holding your hand
It could've been me, yeah, meeting your dad
It could've been me, I'm long gone in love
I'm all gone in love, oh
It could've been me
It could've been me
It could've been me
It could've been me
It could've been me, yeah, holding your hand
It could've been me, yeah, meeting your dad
It could've been me, I'm long gone in love
I'm all gone in love, oh
It could've been me
