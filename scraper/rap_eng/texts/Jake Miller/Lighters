[Hook]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters

[Verse 1]
Throw your flames up in the air
We gon' light the sky on fire
Hold your lighter ever higher
Spark it up now even brighter
This is celebration for all the warriors and fighters
All the dreamers and believers
Let this song be a reminder
Of the times that weren't so easy
All the tears that we have cried
Times we almost gave it up
And times we even almost died
When we try to decide
Is it worth it anymore
But now I see that victory is worth fighting the war
Gotta have a couple nightmares
Before you live your dream
Gotta knock in a couple doors
Like a kid on Halloween
Gotta put a couple thousand dollars in the slot machine
Before you hit the jackpot
Feel you something we've all seen
But the ones that overcome it are the ones that rise above it
And the ones that climb the highest mountain
Just to reach the summit
Are the ones that will be laughing out at all the non believers
So this one is for the dreamers

[Hook]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters

[Verse 2]
Ain't about your days in your life
It's about your life in your days
Because your flight will take off
Even if there are delays
I'm amazed that all these people
Who get stuck in the maze
Cause they refuse to stand out
Instead they waste away their days
Dude it's not a routine
Like a robotic machine
I'd rather live life like an actor on a Hollywood screen
Cuz you are your own director and your life is a seen
I'm seeing way too many people giving up on their dreams
I ain't there to start align
Trying to philosophies
It just ain't my style
To settle, I try to compromise
I would advise open your eyes
Before your life passes ya by
Cuz time flies an goes by in the blink of an eye
But the ones that overcome it are the ones that rise above it
And the ones that climb the highest mountain
Just to reach the summit
Are the ones that will be laughing out at all the non believers
So this one is for the dreamers

[Hook]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters
