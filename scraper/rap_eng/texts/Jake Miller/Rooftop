It's been too much
For too long
I’ve been waiting for the closing doors all to hit me
While I'm falling down

It took a few words
A few times
Now I'm petrified losing sight of my meaning
When you’re not around

I've been waiting all this time
Lost my mind and I'm not fine
Can you hear me

I've been wasting all this time
Just pretending that I'm fine
Are you with me?

So meet me at the rooftop
You know I saved it for ya
So meet me at the rooftop
I hardly even know ya
So please stay right here don't give it up right yet
So never stop the fight if your lungs aren't caving in
Just meet me at the rooftop
Meet me at the rooftop

It's been three days
And three ways
To alleviate the passing aches
Out of body
Now I’m falling down

It took a few tries
To realize
That I’m half as strong from moving on
From my feelings
When you're not around
