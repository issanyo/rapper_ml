[Verse 1]
Pack your bags and let’s go
First thing tomorrow morning
Say goodbye to all that we know
Leave a note in your room as a warning
That you took a lifelong vacation
And you probably won’t return home
Don’t care about the destination as long as we are alone
When sun comes up let’s roll grab your stuff let’s go
We on cruise control
(yeah we on cruise control)
Top back with the windows down
Yeah girl let’s ditch this town
Start a new chapter
Write a new story
Baby let’s hit the ground

[Hook]
Running [x3]
Pack your bags baby let’s go
Stop at nothing, nothing, nothing
Flying down the open road
Yeah
Let’s keep on runnin baby
Let’s keep on runnin
We’ll leave it all behind
We won’t stop at nothing
Just keep on running baby
Just keep on running [repeat]
Hit the ground runnin
Uh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Let’s start this journey
We could wake up extra early
And leave all the world still sleepin
Just follow me and don’t worry
Yeah
Your heart’s my compass
I could take you wherever you please
I’ll even let you drive, baby girl
Just take my keys
When the sun comes up
Let’s roll grab your stuff
Let’s go we on cruise control
(yeah we on cruise control)
Top back with the windows down
Yeah girl let’s ditch this town
Start from stratch
We can start over
Baby let’s hit the ground

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Yeah we be rockin and rollin
There ain’t no stopping or slowin
Yeah we be comin and goin
Leavin town with no warnin
Woah
