[Chorus]
Goodbye to the memories, goodbye to the dream
Didn't know I’d have to find my way back
Can I just let this be?
Goodbye to the memories, goodbye to the dream
Didn't know I’d have to find my way back
Can I just let this be?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, look
Somewhere down the road I guess we took a wrong turn
I took your pictures, lit a match and watched 'em all burn
I can’t take anymore break-ups, or make-ups
So straight up, I won’t be there tomorrow when you wake up
But wait up, listen, baby girl, don’t get it twisted
We gave it all we had, attempted everything to fix it
Another broken heart, I can’t risk it
Girl, it's plain and simple, we took a shot and we missed it
And now the place I piss in is where the memories of us are livin'
Down the drain, no more pain
But, baby, I ain’t kidding, when I tell you that you’ll always have a place in my life
But tonight I'mma make it right
Yeah, and I'mma say

[Chorus]
Goodbye to the memories, goodbye to the dream
Didn’t know I’d have to find my way back
Can I just let this be?
Goodbye to the memories, goodbye to the dream
Didn’t know I’d have to find my way back
Can I just let this be?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I guess I’m back at square one
Our love is rare, it’s too bad it wasn’t well done
Yeah, we had a good run, never reached the finish line
Wish that we could start again, wish we could go back in time
Wish we could have seen the future, now we history
Consistently sending me texts, saying that you’re missing me
I’m tryin' to forget about you, baby girl, you’re killing me
And when you hear that last line, you’ll probably be pissed at me
But what can you, girl, I’m tryin' to do me
Clean slate, fresh start, baby, I’m a new me
I promise that you’ll always have a place in my life
But tonight I'mma make it right
Yeah, and I'mma say

[Chorus]
Goodbye to the memories, goodbye to the dreams
Didn’t know I’d have to find my way back
Can I just let this be?
Goodbye to the memories, goodbye to the dreams
Didn’t know I’d have to find my way back
Can I just let this be?
Can I just let this be?

[Bridge]
Somewhere down the road I guess we took a wrong turn
I took your pictures, lit a match, and watched 'em all burn
Somewhere down the road I guess we took a wrong turn (damn)
I took your pictures, lit a match, and watched 'em (all burn)
I watched 'em all burn

[Chorus]
Goodbye to the memories, goodbye to the dreams
Didn’t know I’d have to find my way back
Can I just let this be?
Goodbye to the memories, goodbye to the dreams
Didn’t know I’d have to find my way back
Can I just let this be?
Goodbye to the memories, goodbye to the dreams
Didn’t know I’d have to find my way back
Can I just let this be?
Goodbye to the memories, goodbye to the dreams
Didn’t know I’d have to find my way back
Can I just let this be?
Can I just let this be?

[Outro]
Goodbye
