[Verse 1: Carlos]
You drive me crazy, I'm so into you
Tell me baby, do you feel it too?

[Pre-Chorus: Logan]
And the taste of your lips got me feeling high
Girl, I swear you're an angel in disguise
Just one look in your eyes got me hypnotized
I'll never be the same

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm lost in love, lost in love
And I don't wanna be found
Lost in love
So glad I found you girl
So let's stay lost in love

[Verse 2: James]
Hearts beat faster, I don't know what to do
I can't stop feeling what I'm feeling for you

[Pre-Chorus: Kendall]
And the taste of your lips got me feeling high
Girl, I swear you're an angel in disguise
Just one look in your eyes got me mesmerized
C'mon let's run away

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm lost in love, lost in love
And I don't wanna be found
Lost in love
So glad I found you girl
So let's stay lost in love
Lost in love
So let's stay lost in love
Lost in love
And I don't wanna be found
Lost in love
So glad I found you girl
So let's stay lost in love

[Verse 3: Jake Miller]
Jake Miller, yeah
Call the FBI, call the CIA
'Cause I'm lost in love, I'm MIA
No GPS, 'cause baby you're my compass
I could show you the world like Christopher Columbus
Baby you ain't even gotta worry 'bout a thing now
Give a star line talking bout Ringo
Let's run away, don't make a sound
'Cause I'm lost in love, I don't wanna be found

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm lost in love, lost in love
And I don't wanna be found
Lost in love
So glad I found you girl
So let's stay lost in love
Lost in love
So let's stay lost in love
Lost in love
And I don't wanna be found
Lost in love
So glad I found you girl
So let's stay lost in love

[Outro: Carlos]
Tell me baby, do you feel it too?
