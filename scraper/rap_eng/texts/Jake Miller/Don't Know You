[Verse 1]
You were blacked out in the bathroom
I said, "Hold on, I'll be back soon"
It was cold out on the way home
If you fell down I would catch you
We were best friends, I remember
Saw third eye in December
If I knew we'd end up here

[Chorus]
It feels like I don't know you anymore, anymore, anymore
Damn, I miss the old you and I know and I know and I know
That people change, but not us
You're not the same and it sucks
It feels like I don't know you anymore, anymore, anymore

[Post-Chorus]
Take me back when
It feels like I don't know you
Take me back when
It feels like I don't know you

[Verse 2]
Take me back when to that summer
And that one girl, you got her number
Down at beach girls
We'd order everything and never pay shit
You were moving to the West Side
Never knew it would be goodbye
When you drove off
We never thought we'd ever end up like this

[Chorus]
It feels like I don't know you anymore, anymore, anymore
Damn, I miss the old you and I know and I know and I know
That people change, but not us
You're not the same and it sucks
It feels like I don't know you anymore, anymore, anymore

[Post-Chorus]
Take me back when
It feels like I don't know you
Take me back when
It feels like I don't know you

[Chorus]
It feels like I don't know you anymore, anymore, anymore
Damn, I miss the old you and I know and I know and I know
That people change, but not us
You're not the same and it sucks
It feels like I don't know you anymore, anymore, anymore

[Post-Chorus]
Take me back when
Ta-da-da-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da-da
(It feels like I don't know you)
Ta-da-da-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da-da
(It feels like I don't know you)
Ta-da-da-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da-da
Take me back when

[Outro]
It feels like I don't know you
