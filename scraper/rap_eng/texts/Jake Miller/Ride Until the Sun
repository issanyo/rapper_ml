[Verse 1]
Lonely hearts and highways
All driving at the same pace
Don't slow down while we're still young
Broken lights and concrete
Are frozen under our feet
Let's fill them in while we're still young

[Pre-Chorus]
We were born to ride
Want you by my side
Chasing paradise

[Chorus]
Tonight, let's drive
Tonight, let's run
Tonight let's ride until the sun
I'll take the wheel
Be my shotgun
Tonight we'll ride until the sun
And it's only just begun
(Ride with me)

[Verse 2]
Stars upon the ceiling
You always dream believing
Let's break out while we're still young
Roll rough until the sunset
Catch fire, never look back
Let's burnout while we're still young

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Going, eighty-five on the one-oh-one
Baby we gon' ride until the sun
We've got the world up in our rearview and we ain't looking back
Car racing like the hit and run
So, come and hop in my car
We'll drive until the stars
There's just me and you, and this [?] guitar
Baby you can take the wheel, don't you worry 'bout a thing
While I serenade you, and sing

[Chorus]
Tonight, let's drive
Tonight, let's run
Tonight let's ride until the sun
I'll take the wheel
Be my shotgun
Tonight we'll ride until the sun
Tonight, let's drive
Tonight, let's run
Tonight let's ride until the sun
I'll take the wheel
Be my shotgun
Tonight we'll ride until the sun
And it's only just begun
(Ride with me)
