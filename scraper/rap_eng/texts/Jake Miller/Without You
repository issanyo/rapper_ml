Yeah I'm coming home
Girl I'm on my way now
I know you've been waiting on me
Just counting down the hours the days the weeks
But girl Im coming home now and i swear to god its true
Ive been around the world but I'd rather be here with you
With you with you with you
I'd rather be here with you
With you with you
Uh Half way across the globe at night
You telling me good morning when I'm telling you good night
You hopin in bed, Im hopin on another flight
Holding my boarding pass, should be holding you tight
Wish I was sitting with you on the couch watching tv
But instead I'm in row 3CB
Face timing so she can see me
I'd rather have the real thing 3D
Yeah, Yeah
Girl I know that you're all alone
And sick of being on your own
I can hear it through the telephone
But soon I'll be coming home
Yeah, you know that you're all alone
And sick of being on your own
But I promise you that I'm coming home
I said that I promise you that Im coming home
Girl I'm on my way now

Just counting down the hours the days the weeks
But girl I'm coming home now and I swear to god it's true
I've been around the world but I'd rather be here with you
With you with you with you
I'd rather be here with you
With you with you
Uh another day another terminal
I keep saying goodbye it feels terrible
Seeing you cry when I leave is unbearable
But coming home to you, its incomparable
Being away like this feels so wrong
I mean seeing your face its been too long
But I'm amazed girl, you've been so strong
Just cause I ain't there doesnt mean I'm gone
I'm coming home baby
Yeah, Yeah
Girl I know that you're all alone
And sick of being on your own
I can hear it through the telephone
But soon I'll be coming home
Yeah, you know that you're all alone
And sick of being on your own
But I promise you that Im coming home
I said that I promise you that I'm coming home
Girl I'm on my way now

Just counting down the hours the days the weeks
But girl I'm coming home now and I swear to god it's true
I've been around the world but I'd rather be here with you
With you with you with you
I'd rather be here with you
With you with you
I spend my days in hotel rooms just thinking about you
Lying in this king size bed that is really made for two
It's been awhile since I've seen your face
I know sometimes it's tough
Cause soon Im coming home to you
But soon's not soon enough
Girl I'm on my way now
I know you've been waiting on me
Just counting down the hours the days the weeks
But girl I'm coming home now and I swear to god it's true
I've been around the world but I'd rather be here with you
Girl I'm on my way now
I know you've been waiting on me
Just counting down the hours the days the weeks
But girl I'm coming home now and I swear to god it's true
I've been around the world but I'd rather be here with you
With you with you with you
I'd rather be here with you
With you with you
