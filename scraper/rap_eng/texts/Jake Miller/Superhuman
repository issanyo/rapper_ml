[Intro]
Superhuman

[Verse 1]
Fucking with the rules of gravity
You ain't gonna get the best of me
Oh no, I'mma rise up
Wanna be a part of paradise
Beautiful and sharp, but then the night
Oh no, I'mma be tough

[Chorus]
I wish I was superhuman, I wish I was ten feet tall
I wanna be cold like you
When you act so cool and you don't care at all
I wish I was superhuman, I wanna have strength like God
I wouldn't feel no heartbreak
I would kiss that pain so it don't hurt at all
Superhuman
Superhuman
Superhuman

[Verse 2]
You and I are kind of chemicals
Mix 'em and we're going up in smoke
Oh no, what do we do?
Going another round in overtime
Take another shot, but I'll survive
Oh no, how about you?

[Chorus]
I wish I was superhuman, I wish I was ten feet tall
I wanna be cold like you
When you act so cool and you don't care at all
I wish I was superhuman, I wanna have strength like God
I wouldn't feel no heartbreak
I would kiss that pain so it don't hurt at all
Superhuman
Superhuman

[Chorus]
I wish I was superhuman, I wish I was ten feet tall
I wanna be cold like you
When you act so cool and you don't care at all
I wish I was superhuman, I wanna have strength like God
I wouldn't feel no heartbreak
I would kiss that pain so it don't hurt at all
Superhuman
Superhuman
Superhuman
