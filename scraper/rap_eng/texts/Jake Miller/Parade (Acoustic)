[Verse 1]
The thought of you
Loving someone new
I just can't fathom, no
No one like you
Your love was all I knew
Somewhere we crashed it, no

[Pre-Chorus]
No point of view
Empty our hearts in two
I'll repair it I promise baby

[Chorus]
It always seems to rain
On your parade
And all I ever wanted
Was the sun on your face
When you're walking, you start smiling
That's me, that's me
When you call, I never answer
That's me, that's me
It always seems to rain
On your parade

[Verse 2]
I play your fool
Swim the ocean just to prove
That you're worth it, yeah
Reservation for two
Dinner, late night rendezvous
Without a purpose
I know you loved it

[Pre-Chorus]
No point of view
Empty our hearts in two
I'll repair it I promise baby

[Chorus]
It always seems to rain
On your parade
And all I ever wanted
Was the sun on your face

[Bridge]
Won't miss a good thing 'til it's gone
Ain't no way we moving on
I just want you, want you to come back to me
Let me fix what I made wrong
Without you here, this ain't a home
I just need you, need you right next to me

[Chorus]
It always seems to rain
On your parade
And all I ever wanted
Was the sun on your face
When you're walking, you start smiling
That's me, that's me
When you call, I never answer
That's me, that's me
It always seems to rain
On your parade
