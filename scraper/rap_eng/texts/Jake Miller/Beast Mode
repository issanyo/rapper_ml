It seems like the world is testing me
Will I conquer, or will it get the best of me?
Half of the world sees success in me
The half other is second guessing me
But I kid you not don't mess with me
Cause I think I got something possed in me
No matter what I'm gonna give whats left in me
I didn't choose this life it was destiny

Now I'm feeling like I might go psycho
Stand back, cause I'm feelin like I might blow
Slim chance, but I'm putting up a fight though
They tell me this the wrong path but I know its right, though
I'm about to pick up the world and shake it
Throw it to the ground and laugh as I break it
Let the whole world know that I'm gonna make it
And if you don't give it to me then I'm gonna take it
BEAST MODE, I'm IN BEAST MODE
Gunning for the top, cock back reload
I'm a new man with a new attitude
But don't get me wrong I'm still me though
I'm all in now, I ain't bluffing
I risk everything, regret nothing
My determinations disgusting
So everyday my ass I'm busting
Lemme take ya back, break it down
Just a couple more months then college bound
Got a scholarship, my bags were packed
Then my world turned upside down
When I got that phone call, so shocking
I thought my heart was stopping
Are you serious? There's a once in life time opportunity knocking

But wait, what now? I thought I had my life figured out
Everything I was once sure about was now skepticism and doubt
Almost lose control, lost sanity
Meanwhile my friends abandoned me
I felt lost in the world for a little bit
I had nobody but my family

But I bounced back and got in the zone
Late nights, just me and the microphone
My friends were off at college while I was right here sitting here at home
They were partying I was cutting tracks
They were going out I was making stacks
This the road I choose so you know I'm gonna walk it proudly and never look back
Now fast forward a couple years
Most of my fears have disappeared
After the blood, the sweat, the tears, I dedicate this right here
To all my non-believers and haters
Y'all doing me nothing but favors
Keep talking, I can't hear you
Someone go get me a translator
It used to get to me, to the old me
Think you can do it better? Then show me
Those who know me least have the most say
Don't judge me if you don't know me
Whether I'm a billioanire or flat broke
You think that matters? Is that a joke?
If you ain't got talent, you really think the money will get you anywhere? Nope

Oh, you wanna play music Monopoly?
I've mastered the game, no topping me
Taking over the world while the money adds up
I'm just passing and going, there's no stopping me
I've worked so hard, I earned it
It's mine now and I'll never return it
I'mma do it, I'mma do it so damn big
Everyday my fans confirm it
So blast off I'm outta here
Outta this world to the atmosphere
So long, I'm gone
Been a hell of a ride, what a year
It's just the start, the beginning
The top of the very first inning
No need for a call to the bull pen
Bottom of the 9th and I'll still be winning
What I went through, it was worth it all
All the times being pinned up against the wall
Trying to please my family, friends and fans
When its all said and done, after all
I gotta do what's right for me
I gotta chase after this dream
I'm so proud of us, how we far came
Me and my whole damn team

God, I'm just doing my best
For real, I feel so blessed
I think somebody's watching over me
Tell me world, did I pass your test?
Did I do this right? Please tell me
I need you now, please help me
Cause life don't come with no manual
I played the cards that you dealt me

My life is on the line every time I rhyme
Always on my grind, 24/7
So much on my mind, someone please remind
Me that I'll be fine where I'm heading
To the fans, my life I owe you
So close to my heart I hold you
But to anyone who ever doubted me
I'm so proud to say that I told you
