[Verse 1]
Done with this game
Fuck the same page
We ain't even in the same book
Simple and plain
Feel like you changed
You don't give me the same look

[Chorus]
You're up and down
You're left and right
Girl, you don't know yourself
If you don't hurry up I'll give my love to someone else
So are you in (in) or out (or out)
Cause I don't need your halfway love
Won't wait (won't wait) around (around)
Praying you'll make your mind up
I've had enough tell me straight up
Girl are you in or you out (you out)
I don't need your halfway love
I don't need your halfway love
I don't need your halfway love
I don't need your halfway love
You in or you out
I don't need your halfway love

[Verse 2]
Dangerous game
Flame to propane
You gon' burn us down
Won't say no names
Who do we blame
Where do we go now?

[Chorus]
You're up and down
You're left and right
Girl, you don't know yourself
If you don't hurry up I'll give my love to someone else
So are you in (in) or out (or out)
Cause I don't need your halfway love
Won't wait (won't wait) around (around)
Praying you'll make your mind up
I've had enough tell me straight up
Girl are you in or you out
I don't need your halfway love
I don't need your halfway love
I don't need your halfway love
I don't need your halfway love
You in or you out
I don't need your halfway love

I don't need your halfway love
I don't need your halfway love
