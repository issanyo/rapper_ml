[Verse 1]
There's something 'bout the way you move that's got me hypnotized
There's something 'bout the way you taste that's got me feelin' high
Oh babe I think we have gone too far to look back now
Tonight I wanna cross that line
So tell me are you down?

[Pre-Chrous]
Okay now you're startin' to sweat
All I see's your silhouette
You're glowin' in these neon lights
Yeah I've waited for so long
Just to hold you in my arms
So there's no goin' back tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause we're about to pass the point of no return
So let's just take our time and let this fire burn
You're naked in my bed right now
It's gettin' so hard to breathe
'Cause we're about to pass the point of no return
The point of no return

[Verse 2]
So tell me why it feels like I've know you my whole life
Oh tell me why your body fits so perfectly with mine
Oh baby I wanna dive inside and make you scream right now
Oh baby let's do everything tonight but sleep right now

[Pre-Chrous]
Okay now you're startin' to sweat
All I see's your silhouette
You're glowin' in these neon lights
Yeah I've waited for so long
Just to hold you in my arms
So there's no goin' back tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause we're about to pass the point of no return
So let's just take our time and let this fire burn
You're naked in my bed right now
It's gettin' so hard to breathe
'Cause we're about to pass the point of no return
'Cause we're about to pass the point of no return
So let's just take our time and let this fire burn
You're naked in my bed right now
It's gettin' so hard to breathe
'Cause we're about to pass the point of no return
The point of no return
