[Verse 1]
Yeah, look
Let me tell you about a kid named Steven
He's slowly running out of things to believe in
Every couple of months his mom leaves him
For no good reason his step-dad beats him
Not too many friends, only ever had a few of them
But recently they don't want anything to do with him
Always eating lunch in the bathroom stall
He just wants to feel normal and be cool again, yeah
Always feeling like the outcast, he's been going crazy ever since his dad passed
He needs guidance and advice but instead
He only has breakdowns and flashbacks of the car crash uh
It's been getting harder everyday, if he was still around everything would be okay
Cause his dad was always the light at the end of the tunnel
But now that same damn tunnel is looking dark and grey
He keeps quiet in the back of the class
And when the bell rings Steven hurries home fast
Scared to death the other kids will kick his ass on the long walk home
Cause its happened in the past so
He's getting used to the black eyes and fat lips
But all he's got is a fake smile and cut wrists
Wishin' he could walk right up to them and show them the scars
And say look you're the reason that I've done this
Maybe they would finally understand and go back to how it was before it all began
But he's just a little different so they taunt him and they beat him
Yeah it's all just fun and games, they don't give a damn, yeah
His older brother ain't around, in and out of jail, hanging with the wrong crowd
He's been doing coke, smoking weed, getting drunk all his life he's a shame
No, he's not too proud
Now his habits are rubbing off on his little bro yeah, but guess what?
Little did he know that everytime he did a line
Everytime he lit a joint
Everytime he took a shot he would set the mode
So Steven's sitting in his room getting high now
Doors locked, music up, with his lights out
He just takes another toke til his room fills with smoke
5-6-7 hours til he knocks out
Now he started stealing pills from his mom
8-9-10 at a time and now they're gone
And maybe for a moment all his problems seem to fade
But the high fades too after not too long
And that's when it really sinks in and that's when it hits him
That these god damn drugs won't fix him
Curled up on the floor, can't take it anymore
Now he's talking to God cuz he's the only one that gets him
On his knees, looking up, can't stop crying
"God I know we haven't talked in a long time
But this time I really need you. Please God help me, say something
Just give me a sign, because now I'm falling apart and
I don't think that I can do it. Please God, give me the strength
To pull through it. Tell me, Should I give up? I could end it all right now
I just don't know if I'm brave enough to do it
Cuz there's gotta be a better way than suicide
Try to wait it out, give it time, you'll be fine
But it's been so long and I still haven't been able to get rid
Of all the thoughts that I feel inside. So sick, so angry, so mad
And to top it off no one even knows that"
That's when he stood up, wiped his tears, walked over to his desk
And got a pen and a notepad
He just couldn't see it getting any better
So on a cold dark night in December, Steven knew exactly what he had to do
But first he sat down and wrote a couple letters
One to his step-dad, one to his mother
Couple to the kids at school, one to his brother
Bringing them the pain that they once brought him
Tear drops on the paper one after another
Yeah, I hope that you all feel guilty
Cuz I'm broken now and you can't heal me
And now you're all an accomplice in murder
Each and every one of you have chipped in to kill me
So the reason that I'm writing you this evening
Is to say goodbye and to tell you that I'm leaving
But don't hold your breath cuz I ain't never coming back
Sincerely yours, Steven
