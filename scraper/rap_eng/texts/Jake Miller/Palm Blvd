[Verse 1]
The 12 year old me, was happy, young, and free
He would hate Hollywood
Hate Hollywood
Last night I had a dream
That the 12 year old me
Said "leave Hollywood
'Cause over here life is good"

[Chorus]
I'm on my way home
Back where I belong
It's been way too long
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
Need to feel real love
Give my mom a hug
Call all my friends up
'Cause I'm on my way
I'm on my way home
I'm on my way, I'm on my way home
I'm on my way, I'm on my way home

[Verse 2]
The 24 year old me
Talks to his sister once a week
I should be ashamed
I hope she don't think I changed
The 24 year old me
Is too caught up in the scene
Feelin' way too far, from palm boulevard

[Chorus]
I'm on my way home
Back where I belong
It's been way too long
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
Need to feel real love
Give my dad a hug
Call all my friends up
'Cause I'm on my way
I'm on my way home
I'm on my way home
I'm on my way, I'm on my way home
I'm on my way, I'm on my way home

[Bridge]
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
Tell the world I'm comin' home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way home
Back where I belong
It's been way too long
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
Need to feel real love
Give my mom a hug
Call all my friends up
'Cause I'm on my way
I'm on my way home
I'm on my way home
I'm on my way, I'm on my way home
Back where I belong
I'm on my way, I'm on my way home
