[Intro]

[Hook: Jake Miller]
Here I stand, in the cold
I try to knock as you change the locks
Now I'm all alone
Where am I supposed to go?
If you are where my home is
I guess that makes me homeless

[Verse 1: Jake Miller]
So what now I got no idea where I'm going
I'm lost with no direction
Like my GPS is broken
I'm walking around the streets
Thinking about you every night
I'm feeling homeless now
Lookin' like the man from I'm alright
See I just wanna come back home
Can't do this on my own
You were the only thing I knew for sure
Guess that I was wrong
See I've tried to walk away
But I just end up at your doorstep
Waiting for my phone to ring
But nope you haven't called yet
So I'm wandering aimlessly
Wish that you, stayed with me
Thought that we, were meant to be
Thought that you, were meant for me
But I guess not
Cause in case you failed to notice
You used to be my home, until you left me homeless

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jake Miller]
So what now, it used to be just you and me
But you kicked me out
Locked the doors and tossed away the keys
From the outside, lookin' in
You would think that I'm just fine
But I'm a bigger wreck than the Titanic inside
I'm sleeping on sidewalks
I'm following street signs
I need some help
I'm feeling stranded
Losing my damn mind
I'm blindfolded by you
Girl you took everything that I own
I keep calling your phone
But all I get is the tones
So I'm looking up at the stars
These street lights they got me
I never planned on living life
Without you here right beside me
But guess I was wrong
Cause in case you failed to notice
You used to be my home, until you left me homeless

[Hook x2]
