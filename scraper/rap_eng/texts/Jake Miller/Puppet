[Verse 1: Jake Miller]
Yeah, lately I feel like a puppet, being pulled in 15 million different places
Girlfriend's on the phone, the other line I got my agent
Like hey Jake, got good news, we just booked another tour
Yea that's good and all but that just means another civil war between me and my girl
What am I supposed to say?
Hey baby, how you doin? I missed you oh by the way I'm bout to leave again
I'm going on a fall tour
But I'll be back before you know it, then I'm all yours
Listen Jake, she'll understand, this is more important
Oh really? You wanna tell her that?
Cause if I ever did she'd probably kill me
Look I'm sorry Jake but it's done deal, you're leavin Thursday
And you'll be on the road during Christmas and your birthday
Great, my girl's mad cause I ain't there a lot
And now I gotta spend my birthday in the courtyard Marryat
Jake I know your stressed man, you've had a busy year
But this is what you sound good for, this is your career
This ain't a shooting for the weak hearted, Jake I thought you knew
But you can't pursue your dream and have a normal life too If you ain't ready tell me now, I never said that it was easy
Otherwise I'll be in my office, you know where to reach me

[Hook: Jake Miller]
Damn, I'm feelin like a puppet
A goddamn puppet
Being pulled in a million different ways
Man I think I'm bout to break
I'm a puppet
A goddamn puppet
Sick of feeling like a puppet
Sometimes I wanna disappear, all these voices in my head
I'm a... I'm a...

[Verse 2: Jake Miller]
Look, hang up with my agent, put my phone down on the table
Five seconds later get a call from my label
Like hey Jake, how you doin? Tell me how's the album comin?
We heard your last song and honestly we didn't love it
We don't think it'll make the cut, could've written better verses
Deadline's in a month and now we startin to get nervous
Stop getting so distracted, start pickin up the pen
You need more time in the studio, and less time with your friends
Cause it's crunch time, should be doing nothing but making music
We follow you on Instagram, see everything you doin
Yea we see you at the beach, at the gym, at the mall
To be honest, doesn't seem like you're working hard at all
How dare you say that I don't even have time to take a shit
I've been working non-stop and I'll be honest, I admit
Sometimes I need a break, this life can drive a man crazy
Especially when your label keeps callin sayin you're lazy
Listen Jake, I know it's hard
Sometimes it isn't fun
But if this album tanks, well your career could be done
If you ain't ready tell us now, never said that it was easy
Otherwise I'll be in my office, you know where to reach me
