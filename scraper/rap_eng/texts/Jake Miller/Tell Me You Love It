[Verse 1]
Why you holding back?
You put up a wall lately, I want it all, baby
No, I won't fall back
You playing games lately, don't play it safe, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I can't speak for you
I can't read your mind
Honestly, if I choose for you
You'd be mine, all mine

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta act like you too cool
Let me be the one to break your rules
If that's the way you feel, then why keep running?
I know you love it, tell me you love it, I know you do
What else can I do?
I'm done playing games, now make your move
If that's the way you feel, then why keep running?
I know you love it, tell me you love it, I know you do

[Verse 2]
I know what I want
Don't you want the same, baby?
That fair exchange, baby?
Don't look back and say that you're missing out
How long are you gonna wait?

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I can't speak for you
I can't read your mind
Honestly, if I choose for you
You'd be mine, all mine

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta act like you too cool
Let me be the one to break your rules
If that's the way you feel, then why keep running?
I know you love it, tell me you love it, I know you do
What else can I do?
I'm done playing games, now make your move
If that's the way you feel, then why keep running?
I know you love it, tell me you love it, I know you do

[Bridge]
Hey, is it love, is it lust that we fucking, baby?
Just don't keep me waiting around
Open up, up, up, I'll never let you down
I know that you love it, girl

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta act like you too cool
Let me be the one to break your rules
If that's the way you feel, then why keep running?
I know you love it, tell me you love it, babe
What else can I do?
I'm done playing games, now make the move
If that's the way you feel, then why keep running?
I know you love it, tell me you love it, I know you do

[Outro]
I know that you love it
I know that you love it, yeah
I know you love it, tell me you love it, I know you do
