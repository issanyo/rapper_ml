[Verse 1]
Waking up in a bright white room
I've never seen it look so simple, oh yeah
I wanna waste away my whole day with you
Buried underneath these pillows

[Pre-Chorus]
Sunday morning let's just stay
In bed and talk all day
Paradise in my apartment
Rain is falling down
Can't get this smile off my face
Think I need to tell you something

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I think I'm in love
In love again
Look what you've done
I think I'm in love
In love again

(In love again)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Dancing round the room like we're good
And spilling champagne on the sofa, oh yeah
I got your body pinned against my fridge
It's like the whole world stops when I hold ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Sunday morning let's just stay
In bed and talk all day
Paradise in my apartment
Rain is falling down
Can't get this smile off my face
Think I need to tell you something

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I think I'm in love
In love again
Look what you've done
I think I'm in love
In love again

[Bridge]
In my mind, in my head
There's an angel in my bed
We can fly, fly away
In my mind, in my head
There's an angel in my bed
We can fly, fly away

[Chorus]
(Baby we can fly)
Look what you've done
I think I'm in love
In love again
Look what you've done
I think I'm in love
In love again
