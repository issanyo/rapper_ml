[Intro]
(All carry on items should now be stored securely in
The overhead compartment
Or under the seat in front of you. Thank you and enjoy your flight.)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you can be my carry on
You can be my carry on
From New York to LA, Miami to Chicago
You can be my carry on and go wherever I go
Cause I know together we gon' live it up
So, baby hop up in my suitcase and zip it up
So lay down on the conveyor belt
I'll put you through security
X-Ray scans like you 'bout to get some surgery
Overweight bag fees, yeah, you know I'll pay that
Cause baby, you the bomb, like wait... I can't say that
And if you want we can fly first class now
I can be the TSA, I'll give you the pat down
You don't need a ticket
Just come with me and kick it
If you be my carry on, the sky's the limit

[Chorus]
Cause I just wanna take you everywhere I go
Because I hate to leave you all alone
There's no need to go and check you on cause
Baby you can be my carry on, you can be my carry on
So whatcha you say, won't you hop into my luggage?
Everywhere I go, baby girl you know you coming
Yeah, we 'bout to board, so tell me what you waiting on?
Baby, you can be my carry on

[Verse 2]
Wherever you are, yeah, that's where I wanna be
But, for the next 90 minutes, I'll slide you under my seat
Or in the overhead compartment
I beg your pardon but, please stow your bags away
We 'bout to be departing
Seatbelts on as we fly up
But when it's off we 'gon join the mile high club
So baby meet me in the lavatory, we gon' make some turbulence
And if it says occupied please don't come disturbin' it
Cause I'm a show you the world from a different view
Take you to places in the magazines you flipping through
There won't be no more missing you, cause you'll be by my side
Baby you gon' be my carry on 'till the day I die

[Chorus]
Cause I just wanna take you everywhere I go
Because I hate to leave you all alone
There's no need to go and check you on cause
Baby you can be my carry on, you can be my carry on
So whatcha you say, won't you hop into my luggage?
Everywhere I go, baby girl you know you coming
Yeah, we 'bout to board, so tell me what you waiting on?
Baby, you can be my carry on

[Bridge]
New York to LA, Miami to Chicago
You can be my carry on and go wherever, go wherever
New York to LA, Miami to Chicago
You can be my carry on and go wherever, go wherever
New York to LA, Miami to Chicago
You can be my carry on and go wherever I go
New York to LA, Miami to Chicago
You can be my carry on

[Chorus]
Cause I just wanna take you everywhere I go
Because I hate to leave you all alone
There's no need to go and check you on cause
Baby you can be my carry on, you can be my carry on
Baby you can be my carry on, you can be my carry on
So whatcha you say, won't you hop into my luggage?
Everywhere I go, baby girl you know you coming
Yeah, we 'bout to board, so tell me what you waiting on?
Baby, you can be my carry on
