CHORUS:
I came to party (Yeeah!)
We came to party (Girls!)
Please move your body (Woo!)
Show me that naughty (What's up?)
I came to party (Yeah!)
We came to party (Girls!)
Please move your body (Woo!)
Show me that naughty (Go!)

Let me introduce myself
Iâ€™ll be the baller dirt lifestyle bad for the health
And I'll admit the truth is I'm only here to get drunk
Maybe spit a quick rhyme to the beat of my trunk
Yeah the trunk be the spot holdin' the goods
Liquor bottles, ammunition, chainsaw for the woods
I got to demonstrate I got a block full of the cops
Spit heaters, pop shots, give it all that I got

I can smell the role call, it be calling my name
Ten O'clock in the morning popping champagne
More like can of beers on my way to grab another keg
For the party later on, I ain't pullin' ya leg
We got a big bash plan
Lot of party papers that'll fix that, man
Look at all the ladies
How could you not wanna party with that?
How could you not wanna keep comin' back?

CHORUS:
I came to party (Yeah!)
We came to party (Girls!)
Please move your body (Woo!)
Show me that naughty (Come on!)
I came to party (Yeah!)
We came to party (Girls!)
Please move your body (Woo!)
Show me that naughty (Go!)

If ya got a buzz on give the horn a beep beep
If you on the creep creep better be discreet
Pullin' up to the soiree in your fly Jeep
Perfect setup to the perfect night, women to meet
A reputation to hold, yeah, you know it ain't a matter
You's a party monster, chingin' through the chatter
Somebody hit the front door, it's about to get started
I'm gunna bet this is a good time; it's highly regarded

All the bitches in the place, yeah, step and do your naughty
Show the fellas how to really sex up ya body
Ya came to get down to the sound of a rapper names D-Ball
Thanks for comin' to the party
Yeah, grab another cocktail makin' sure ya mingle
It be mandatory; don't leave single
Say it with me now we be comin' up soon
Another day, another dollar, 'nother party go BOOM!

CHORUS:
I came to party (Yeah!)
We came to party (Girls!)
Please move your body (Woo!)
Show me that naughty (Come on!)
I came to party (Yeah!)
We came to party (Girls!)
Please move your body (Woo!)
Show me that naughty (Go!)
