Yeah! I'm just doin' my thang, cause this is my shot!

I'm just doin' my thang, 'cause I'm workin' like your mama
Always hell'a hot, stove top, no drama
Hop up in my chain, straight lookin' cold train
Got money on my brain, so I'm spittin' like game
I'm a hit 'em with a little bit of this and that
Maintain on a muh-fuckin' platinum rap
Never change I'm insanely gifted
Rip it, like the weed when it gets you lifted
Not talkin' bout money, then I don't wanna talk
I'm doin' my thang and I'm never gonna stop
Griming and rhyming, diamonds and timing
That's all I'm talkin' about, I'm out!

Doin' my thang
Doin' my thang
Doin' my thang
Doin', doin' my thang
Doin' my thang
Doin', doin' my thang
Doin' my thang
My thang, thang, thang, thang

Doin' my thang feels so amazin'
Let the beat bang, it's so contagious
Music for the streets, got the speakers bassin'
Doin' my thang feels so amazin'

Doin' my thang
Doin' my thang
Doin' my thang
Doin', doin' my thang
Doin' my thang
Doin', doin' my thang
Doin' my thang
My thang, thang, thang, thang

Why you buggin' why you hating, why you trippin' on us
We just relaxin' sitting back we sipping on Corona's
Is that your girlfriend on my lap
Oops! I didn't mean to bone her
But she was following the smell of my kush-aroma
Yeah, I do it like you doesn't
I'm a little stupid, you ain't nothin'
Fuck that hater, he ain't stuntin'
He ain't got a car with a push-start button
Got some 20's
Nah, just frontin' but I keep 'em fresh
Tatted from my feet to neck
You don't wanna meet your death

Doin' my thang
Doin', doin' my thang (But I'll do it)
Doin' my thang
Doin', doin' my thang (I thought you knew it)
Doin' my thang
Doin', doin' my thang (But you blew it)
Doin' my thang
My thang, thang, thang, thang (Yeah we do it)

Doin' my thang feels so amazin'
Let the beat bang, it's so contagious
Music for the streets, got the speakers bassin'
Doin' my thang feels so amazin'

Doin' my thang
Doin', doin' my thang
Doin' my thang
Doin', doin' my thang
Doin' my thang
Doin', doin' my thang
Doin' my thang
My thang, thang, thang, thang

Okay!
Killing the noise
Bring on da night
Ya bring on da thunder
Ya set all da tracks on fire
Heaven should plunder
Making you wonder
Weather or not i'm da enemy
Making you think i'm a friend of this species
Anybody wanna get a bite of my vicious
Ya you better eat weedies
Made a maniacal context
Doin my thang in da streets & i'm banging
Back on the block Brokencyde
Where all da dope kids are hanging
Who wanna alter my hustle muscle my shine
Money yall
She dump the woffers ya
She dump the ride
We bump the 808 spang them all night
If you be feeling like you wanna party with us
Make it so
Get up
Back it up
Rip another hole
And pump up the volume
Lets go

Doin' my thang feels so amazin'
Let the beat bang, it's so contagious
Music for the streets, got the speakers bassin'
Doin' my thang feels so amazin'

Doin' my thang
Doin', doin' my thang
Doin' my thang
Doin', doin' my thang
Doin' my thang
Doin', doin' my thang
Doin' my thang
My thang, thang, thang, thang
