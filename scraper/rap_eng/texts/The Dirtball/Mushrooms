[Intro]
Well good morning my friends, today we shall discuss the mushrooms
How many of you like mushrooms? Ah yes, very nice, very good
Now how many of you like psychedelic mushrooms? Alrighty let's go find some
Form a single line behind me, walk slow (follow me kids, come one now, come on), you can do this , let's go

[Hook]
What have these mushrooms all done to my mind?
Running through the pines, my head feels wrapped in twine
What have these mushrooms all done with my mind?
Shrooms I won't decline, wash them down with wine

[Verse 1]
My life goes better with a mushroom
I seem like I'm in a better mood when I'm on a mushroom
Clouded up when I'm packing a boom clack, clack, kaboom
Get the maniac sounds of I wanna fucking shrooma
It's bound to do ya, all I gotta say is oh no I'm staring at a gobo
But it ain't my name I don't know my name so
Why the fuck am I even tryna get a witness
Nobody hangin' out with a weird muothafucker like this
Like this, everybody make a fist
That be the size of the shroom that I ate
I am so high that I intoxicate, anybody looking at me in another way
Gonna get a watermelon thrown at them, yep, yep I got em
Oh f*ck can't feel my nose I can't feel my toes
I'm gonna lay down on them, I'm in a full meltdown tripping on the way
The tree blows and the way the wind caught them
It's time to come to grips I got a long time til I hit bottom, bottom
Bottoming out on the trip and psychotically flowing on all the ju ju
I'm not them, I'm proud enough to get up out of this chair
I'm proud enough to stop pulling my hair
I'm proud enough to get another mushroom outta my backpack
Yo sitting right there, gonna sit back close my eyes
For I gotta get a move on back to life
This is the re-up and now is the time
Mushrooms on my mind

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
How many kinds of the mushrooms have you really ate?
I focus on eight comfortable ones that are no correlate
Yo, you never can't tell when you eat them
Poisonous or in salt don't eat them, treat em, do a lil' bit of thought
Freedom, freedom, fighter when I wanna fight, fight
When I'm in the night shade and I know I gotta eat them, eat them
I sit in my room and I bubble the water for tea
Quicker to get in the blood stream, quicker to trip on the light beam
Quicker to give it to y'all, "Dirtball you got me fucked up
Why the fuck you do this to us, didn't really wanna get this high
Why you gots to make me fry", look man feel bad but it ain't my fault
I'm the one over here yo stuck in a vault
Where the vault come from don't know
But I gotta put a halt to the mushroom gods
Can't see a mutha f*ckin' thing like I'm in a fog
And nobody seemin to care that I'm dying a miserable death
With no one to call, no one to call and nowhere to fall, nowhere to fall
I'll leave it to y'all, you too can be tall
The thin or the fat, the big or the small, they call me the Ball
I'm really the one that can give you the psilocybinic advice
Now won't that be nice?

[Hook]

[Bridge]
We party, we party we do it nonstop
We party, we party until they call the cops
We party, we party we keep it hardcore
We party, we party, we party y'all
We party, we party we do it nonstop
We party, we party until they call the cops
We party, we party we keep it hardcore
We party, we party, we party y'all
