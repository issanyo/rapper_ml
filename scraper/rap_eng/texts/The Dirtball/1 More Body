[Verse 1: Jared Gomes of (hed) P.E.]
I spit the prophecy, this ain't just rap
It's an epiphany, another bomb track
You a bitch slap, I'm the boom bap
Yeah, you can get with this or you-
Fuckin' emcees talk smack
But their rhymes are so whack
So step back, I rep that mic
And rock all night, I'm alright
I'm on fire and I won't stop
I won't quit, I won't die, I can't fail
I'mma raise hell nigga, nigga I make bail
Unplugged from the matrix and you hate this
I'm the vendetta, Neo - I'm the one
We anonymous, we can't be undone

[Hook: Jared Gomes]
How can you sleep when your bed is on fire
(1 more body)
I don't want to be one more body for the grinder
(1 more body)
How can you sleep when your bed is on fire
(1 more body)
I don't want to be one more body for the grinder

1 more body
Grind 'em up
1 more body
Grind 'em up
1 more body
Grind 'em up
1 more body
We grind 'em up

[Verse 2: The Dirtball]
They can fuck off
I clock pop dumb fucks and beef, bruv
My sharp blade gonna cut you up
So what now? Uppercut, fury fist, kapow
I ain't gonna let a sucka motherfucka wear me down
I'm loud, I'm gangster, rocks heavyweight
Shock while I in the ring, bop while I devastate
Pitch forking, night stalking, pissed as fuck
Stand ready on the trigger, don't push your luck

[Verse 3: D-Loc]
I date rape the bars, gun sacks
Hit you with that weed rap
You talk behind my back
You get slapped like a bitch
Catch an ear for my lyrics
Cut you up, sew you like a stitch
I'm an all-star, yeah, you ride the bench
Quit to hit 'em, fuck 'em man
Quick to split 'em in the gut
I'm picking them up off the ground
And letting my dogs look out the pound
Chew their mugs, spit them out
Dumping their bodies around the town
Zipping up lips, shutting 'em down
D-Loc, he's busting rounds

[Bridge]

[Verse 4: Daddy X]
I'm a .44 magnum, dead body dragging
West side outlaw, start toe tagging
From the fire, spit by the dragon
Lords of the underground, no need for bragging
This is mashing while speaking on truth
They got the bomb track, bring in the truth
We are menaces to society, no need to lie to me
We stay high, don't question our sobriety
I got demons screaming inside of me
Crime defining me, we are the dynasty
One body, who's gonna stop me, huh?
One body who's gonna stop
One body who's gonna stop me, huh?
One body who's gonna drop

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
I say, fuck authority - they are the minority
Together we stand up tall, the new majority
Kill 'em all, let God sort 'em out
The prodigal son returned, Apocalypse Now
It's the purge, feed the urge
To blast somebody in the mind like they deserve
This is the end times, I am so ready
Like the pair of doomsday, hold the gate steady
The pale horse upon 'em, sacked death
Broken is the seal like the ribs in your chest
Into your lungs, make it hard for you to breathe
Choking up on bile, you're infected with disease
One more for the grinder, set a reminder
No choices left no nerve, no black box transponder
Long gone, laid to waste, you ain't safe
One less bitch now when murder was the case

[Verse 6: Monoxide of Twiztid]
I ain't the beast but I'm what the beast is afraid of
You come in peace but you're leaving in pieces, straight up
I'm like an octopus coming from every angle
Ain't no stopping this when I'm swinging the blade
I'm the ominous synonymous
Synonymous with ripping through people
Like they were cartilage and I'm driven by evil
And the only thing I'm driving is a knife in your spine
I'll cull a hundred times like I'm stuck in rewind, screaming...

[Verse 7: Jamie Madrox of Twiztid]
I don't want to be one more body
Two dead and kin left again to party
I run an axe like a lumberjack
And I smack till you blood in my cup of Bacardi
Bottoms up when I come for life
Rhyme like a vampire ready to sink teeth in fresh meat
Time for the pain, I'm out of my brain
Sick fuck with a wig, nocturnal and I don't sleep
Underground like our rap, you're boned
In the three piece suit, covered in dirt, I'm global
When my throw weird, bask me in blood
In the booth and on mic when I'm talking, involved
Twisted and heavy, sick and demented killing spree
Lunatics who we be, you destined to be a body

[Hook]
