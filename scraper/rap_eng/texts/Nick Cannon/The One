Can I be the one?
Let me show you how it sure is good
I just don't know why
I just met this dude
Can I be the one?

[Verse One]
It the r-o-m-e-o you know
And I roll with plenty dough fa sho
Slow po in the Bentley, yo lets go
No the thank ain't empty, we ova flow
Get your back into it keep it movin'
New no limit is the movement
We taking over all industries
Shawty your right you should have been with me
With silk and P, we winning deez
See you smile, we energy
I can see that you are really into me
While that other cat is just an amatuer, you dealin' with a pro
You need a manager I'll teach you how to roll
Got my first million when I was just 12 years old
Shawty, I don't mean to brag and boast
But, I like your style you just got chose

[Verse Two]
Why are you dealing with chicken dinnas
When you need a winna
Shopping sprees, Bentley and skinna
Boo's back is phat and waist is thinna
Kinda make a sanctified turn to sinna
Drop that zero turn to this hero
"You talking to me?" like Bobby de niro
Mami no need for conversatin
All I need is for your man to stop hatin'
Stay patient, we gon run it
The front of the club, in my six hundred
Or a "hum-v" you can have it rough if you want
Running up my credit, running up my cash
Running up on my mind, running up my gas
Running up my time, running up fast
To getta autograph, I like your body work
Mama rung the bell..

Ya mami, you doing damage I feel you
Rome-o has be Destine to be realer

If you leave me ma hit me up

And ain't afraid to hit 'em up like Laila Ali

To hop on fire, and ice the wrist
I want you to be me lil' hershey kiss
