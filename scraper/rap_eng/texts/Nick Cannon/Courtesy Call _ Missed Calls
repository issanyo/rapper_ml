[Part 1: Courtesy Call]

[Sample: Shai]
And if I ever (ever fall)
In love again (again)
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ever (ever fall)
In love so true (so true)
I will be sure that the lady's just like you

[Verse 1]
I swear I'll never chase a bitch again
Thought she was some girl that let me do that shit, that's [?]
Swimming with the sharks made me notice all my fishy friends
Smoking in the car, forgot, need to get my windows tinted
Fuck it, let 'em watch
Boy you look like ghetto pots
I avoid the headaches probably cause I just get head a lot
That's Medusa, that's Versace
My rollie [?], that [?] smoking rocky
All these haters man, tell me who gon' stop me?
[?], they talk shit about my posse
[?] tried to take me out the squad
Hold their throat, they're looking at the God, oh God
I wanna see my niggas doing well now
All my niggas being fair, but they in jail now

[Hook]
This a courtesy call for those that are sleep
It's time I hit up your bitch and fuck her to sleep

[Bridge]
Courtesy call, courtesy call
Hit up your bitch and fuck her to sleep
Courtesy call, courtesy call
It's time I hit up your bitch and fuck her to sleep
Fuck up the beat, fuck her to sleep
Fuck up the beat, fuck her to sleep
Fucking your bitch, fuck up the beat
Fuck her to sleep
Courtesy call, courtesy call

Damn...
She ain't picking up the phone..

[Hook]
Girl I'm out front
Tell the driver I'm ready
Girl, I know where I'm goin'
But you been on my mind heavy
Ima roll up in the back seat
Tell the driver take the back streets
Cuttin' through the hill like mothafucka
Ima pop a pill in this mothafucka
Girl, I thought you'd kill for a mothafucka
But now you don't feel for a mothafucka
Is this the price that's left with the [?] fresh
With a will in this mothafucka

[Verse 2]
I just called again
I don't think you understand
I just hope you call me back
I just hope you call me back
I gotta stay in motion
This house reminds me of you
Whenever I'm here fucks me up
Yeah

[Hook 2]
Girl I'm out front
Tell the driver I'm ready
Girl, I know where I'm goin'
But you been on my mind heavy
Ima roll up in the back seat
Tell the driver take the back streets
Cut-cuttin' through the hill like mothafucka
Ima pop a pill in this mothafucka
Girl, I thought you'd kill for a mothafucka
But now you don't feel for a mothafucka
Girl I kept the candy rain, so forreal in this mothafucka
Now you wanna deal with these other suckers
