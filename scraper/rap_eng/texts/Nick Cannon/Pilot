[Intro: Nick Cannon]
Pick up and kill it
Kill it
Kill it (4x)

[Verse 1: Nick Cannon]
He think he's fly, don't even try that
All my flights, you know they private
And i'm gonna do this, slim like a diet
Boy Swae Lee, you real quiet

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Young Swae Lee, i'm fly like a pilot
Yeah you know when i smoke [?], it be the highest
I am first class, I am first class
I get on the plane and let my seat back

[Verse 3: Nick Cannon]
He let his seat back, y'all just relax
You know black squad, y'all so whack
It's the red squad, you know web go fly
We can do this all fucking night
So, we keep jumping

[Outro: Nick Cannon]
Pick up an kill it
Kill it
Kill it (4x)
