Millionaire named Nick mane
And that's just all my [?]
Don't talk about my chick mane

She bought a plane, that's 6 days
But she put that shit in Nick's name

Two bad bitches and I got 'em in my automatic

[Hook]

When I walk up in the club it's like lights, camera, action
Diamonds shoes, Thriller

Y'all see the fashion

My white Lambo love niggas
Car dashin' (Bla, bla, bla)
Black car flashin'
Nigga tuck yo' cash in

Like white peoples dancing
My currency's Republican, they hate paying taxes
Fuck it it's just me at war

Do the math, if you had half of my stash you'd be relaxing
Bitch I'm a problem, improper fractions
Money don't talk unless Bill Gates starts rapping
Nah nigga, nah nigga, ain't gon' happen

[Hook]

[Outro]
Haha

They hate me cause they ain't me
Haha
Yo, haters is help and we don't argue with the help
Honestly
If a hater saw me walking on water
They'd swear I can't swim
Yo, it is what it is
I tell you like this though
Real talk

Cause I'd be like
Fuck me too
If I wasn't, wasn't me
Hahaha
