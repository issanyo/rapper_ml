Yo let's do this for the grown folks

[Chorus]
Broken glass everywhere
We hit the 6 in the mornin like we just don't care
Girl, who you rollin to the club with {you}
Girl, who you turnin all them bottles with {you}
Girl, who you rollin on them dubs with {you}
Girl, who you freakin in the tub with {you}

Girl, Broken glass everywhere
We hit the 6 in the mornin like we just don't care
Girl, who you tryna get smart with {you}
Girl, who you rollin them eyes at {you}
Girl, who your girl tryna holla at {you}
Girl, who y'all leavin the club with {you}

[Verse 1]
Yo shorty watchu wanna do
A stars up in front of you
All tall lookin wonderful
Carja I gotta few
I gotta few ounce up in Malibu
You would come back the same shade of them things thats around you
All up in the club with thugs like we bad
Addicted to them chicks should be up in rehab
And the ice got em stuck freeze tag
Yo man the myth the Nick Cannon he's bad
But I ain't never seen a chick work it out like you
And I ain't never seen a chick wear a blouse like you
And I ain't never seen a chick wail out like you
The way you pop it drop it mama I think I like you
So come uptown Malibu where the soups hot and blue
I wanna see you move and get a smile outta you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
All up into woman keep layin next to me
Cannon the kid that make skinny sexy
Sexes hefty and ma's with lefty
Saw a puerto rican mami and she wanna bless me
A chick named Leslie others connected me
He gave her the two-way and she keep on textin me
Im from Texas named Lexas
Shorty only want me couse she like my necklace
But when I'm in town its bed and breakfast
I thought you knew theres a few on my checklist
Girl in the photo-booth with a gold tooth
Danes the truth said her name was Ruth
So I pondered to what she often do
Says she like Proton Boots and Ajam Maju
Respect this don't get it to wreckless
Cause you could be the next chick on the checklist

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now I'm up in the V.I.P. just thuggin it out
Flashin like a star you know shinin her mouth
The boys over there tryna figure me out
If they call security they gon get a kick in the mouth
Got hundreds in my hair Jacob on the other
Party's almost over but we can hit another
Tell the Valley to pull up the truck
Shorty such-n-such lets keep in touch
Saw the sun comin up hit the beach or what?
We can eat some brunch mama get in the front
Got your girls in the back but they ain't tryna get nasty
They can get the tax if you ask me

[Chorus]
