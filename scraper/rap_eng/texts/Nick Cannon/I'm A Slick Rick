[Verse 1]
Now once upon a time in a far away land
There lived a young man who was so outstanding
To make it interesting it's me Nick Cannon
He's very fly god father his name was Ricky D
I'm a tell y'all like slick rick told me
Put that million dollar smile on your mouth full of gold teeth ( cheese )
Then ricki said go ahead and switch the style up
And if them hate the let them hate then watch the money pile up
Stay fresh, dress like a million bucks
Whether it's Tom Ford it or you rockin' some chucks
Two step out the house stop sure, oh no
I think they forgot how yougigolo
So pimp bones in my body
Rock them body hottie
Rock them like ladi dadi
We came to party

We don't bother nobody
But if this was karate
I'm Mr. Miyagi

Excuse me Eminem, Why you lying on your dick?

Then this between me and you dude, let's chunk em'
I see your mouth moving but you're soft, Teddy Ruxpin
I tried to holla at you at the B.E.T show
But you was scared out of trouble
More security than the pope
While you was in your bubble I was rolling dolo
Anytime your face in the streets it's them sign for grow mo'
Uh, oh no

See my name is slick rick not shady flake
I'm a mop you up with my wap like it's 88
Cause Cannon birth on the block where they got math figures
Now send a shouts out to my Cali Swag niggas
