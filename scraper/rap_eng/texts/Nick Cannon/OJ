You can run as fast as you can
You can see but cannot touch me

[Verse 1: Nick Cannon]
We running around juking them
We running through the hole and juking them
I keep it organic, I'm juicing these
More head than a Yamaka Jewish
Take off in the Coupe with no roof in this
My crew is too live like [?]
We cutting like 9's, get sued [?]
We're killing the club, OJ Simpson

[Chorus]
You can run as fast as you can
But you're never gonna catch me
You can run as fast as you can
But I've always been [?]
You can run as fast as you can
You can see but cannot touch me
You can run as fast as you can

[Hook]
Now OJ Simpson
Now OJ Simpson
Now OJ Simpson

[Bridge: Polow da Don]
The liquor, is poured
You blocking, we scored
While you at home, we [?]
And while you [?], we [?]

[Chorus]
You can run as fast as you can
But you're never gonna catch me
You can run as fast as you can
But I've always been [?]
You can run as fast as you can
You can see but cannot touch me
You can run as fast as you can

[Hook]
Now OJ Simpson
Now OJ Simpson
Now OJ Simpson
