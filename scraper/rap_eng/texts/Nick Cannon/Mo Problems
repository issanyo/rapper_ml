[Verse 1: Charlie Clips]
Look, look
You already know they got a problem on it
What's a Bad Boy track if they don't add Harlem on it
Get your girl box wet, then I throw a condom on it
You could get your mind right 'till my niggas stompin' on it
I know we makin' you nervous with these burners
Versus the headshot the hospital dinner servers
Know it's over when they start backing up all them [?]
Beside the churches and the reverend singing them verses
Ha, my nigga, you're still nervous
We countin' more money by a mistake tht you do on purpose
Every line tight, you can flip it, rip and reverse it
And every line sound like it still written in cursive
So, who hot, you not
You can bring your whole squad and still get your crew shot
I hope [?] still in a movie Q's got
Holding one arm like Q on the rooftop
Elevator style, let them shots bang out
Your baby momma's mouth where I let it hang out
The weather be gettin' hotter 'till we pull our chains out
NCredible black gang, let our name ring out

[Hook: Kelly Price]
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see

[Verse 2: Nick Cannon]
Now, Nick got big rocks
Flava Flav watch, we do it for hip-hop
My diamonds stay shining, your rollie don't tick-tock
Top 5, Nick, Jigga, Slick, Big, Pac
Yeah, it's the same ol' pimp, Nick
You know ain't nothing change but my limp
Just bought a yatcht, got my name on a blimp
All my ex hoes got my name on them
Don't believe NCredible, nigga, you a wimp
My boy'll cut your head, why they call him Charlie Clips
Shouts out to Holla, that man is a hit
Your bitches, we don't need them, we leave them Conceited
Yeah, the whole crew [?] a movie
