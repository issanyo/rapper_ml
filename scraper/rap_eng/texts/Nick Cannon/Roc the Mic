[Intro: Hitman Holla]
It's Hitman in the place with Nick Cannon
And we got what it take to steal your bitch right now
Better watch what you say to one of us
'Cause you'll fuck around and [?]

[Verse 1: Hitman Holla]
Hitman was 18, entertainin' 'em
By 21, they was lovin' 'em, I'm strapped right now for the fuck of it
I'm a fool boy, Midwest Lou boy
You can't get Mick, you'll settle for who boy?
Incredible flow, I'm icy
Battle rap TV, you know that I'm pricey
I get paid for movies, I'm Spike Lee
So that's two different checks on the side, I'm Nike
Don't believe these rappers, they great liars
A hundred in a Wraith, Ferrari got great tires
Flow gasoline with matches, straight fire
Pockets on wet and that mean that my cake higher
Used to drive my baby mama whip
Now the paparazzi can spot me in all kinds of shit
I make rappers realize that they weak
They be like maybe I'm better off making beats
It's Hitman in the place to be bitch
And I got enough bullets to fill the whole clip
You better watch what you say to me and Nick
'Cause that's a quick way to get your shit split

[Verse 2: Nick Cannon]
I hit your bitch when I'm traveling
She give me head when I'm traveling
Now I wrap my head like the Taliban
Been rich since LeBron was in Akron
Rap money coming in, nigga why you actin' in?
Bitches on my dick, actresses so scandalous
Kelly Washington couldn't handle all my scandaling
Denzel, we worry all the whips I be handling
My rain game, dancing on your bitch like a Spanish man
My lips hold clips, no hello to mariachi band
Ask the karraka, ka-ka-ka-ka
Shakin' shit up in my ra-ka-ka-ka
Then I tell them bitches bye like hasta ma√±ana
Save them bitches' lives, my name is Ayalah
Keisha, Leesa, Neici, and Dia
In a dick sucking contest, they can get sponsored
She got what it takes to rock my mic right

[Verse 3: Conceited]
You see [?] who's as hot as this?
She on deck like a pirate ship, wrist on ice like a hockey stick
Don't want to brag but I throw it in the bag when I'm shoppin' it
Vending machine how I'm dropping chips
If she bad then I'ma get that ho
And I go right in the box like it's tic-tac-toe
She with me, you better please believe
That I'ma whisper in her ear like I'm Keak Da Sneak
And like, rock the mic by yourself and do it solo
She type thick and get the nice dick, I call it po-po
I made her bounce up and down, I call it pogo
And now I got her wrapped around a finger, yo-yo
You seen these sneakers before, now that's a no-no
I got more kicks 'round house than in a dojo
Bring your shawty to me, I bet she go low
And be right inside of my lap, I call her flow joe
Hit C-O-N, I got freaks in my Jeep
And she got enough ass to fill the whole seat
Watch out 'fore you step on my sneaks
'Cause I will cause havoc and key your Mar-V, nigga

[Verse 4: Charlie Clips]
Fat daddy, young scrappy
No he ain't the OG gangster, yes I is
Come on, don't test I kid
Your manager promoting scrubs like left eye did
Black Squad in this bitch, ain't no comparison
You sleepin' on your man's floor, boy it's embarassing
Tell your baby moms chill with all the chatter
And let her know we fire hoes out the truck with the ladder in
Trust me, you don't want to go through that again
They say on your freestyles it sound like you battling
Well maybe I am battling
All these industry niggas to put these squares in a garden like Madison
Watch out, let me get back on my real shit
Pull my card, get decked, I ain't the one you should deal with
Black Squad, I told you we ready to kill shit
Chains on, and they lookin' bright, Will Smith
To get your baby moms in the whip, it was easy
She'll do some bullshit and have her call you on threeway
She got her arms strong tryna give me a BJ
Funny she rocked the mic while we on freeway, I'm gone
