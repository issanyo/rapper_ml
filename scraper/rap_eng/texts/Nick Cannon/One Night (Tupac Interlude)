[Hook]
I only got one night
Round and round, round and round
I only got one night
Round and round, round and round
I only got one night
Round and round, round and round
I only got one night
Round and round, round and round

[Verse1]
All respect to those who keep their hoes in check
Cause, oh, you know they sweat a brother majorly
So why why your girl keeps paging me?
So why why your girl keeps paging me?
Tell me that you needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, squeeze me, take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy

[Hook]
I only got one night
Round and round, round and round
I only got one night
Round and round, round and round
I only got one night
Round and round, round and round
I only got one night
Round and round, round and round

[Verse 2]
Baby got a problem saying "bye-bye"
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask "why?" Don't matter!
Now everybody's looking for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy when you see me
Hit my number, baby, call me, when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie

[Hook]
I only got one night
Round and round, round and round
I only got one night
Round and round, round and round
I only got one night
Round and round, round and round
I only got one night
Round and round, round and round
