[Chorus:]
And if I ev-ever fall in love again
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ev-ever fall in love so true
I will make sure that the lady's just like you
Oh!

[Nick Cannon:]
What's happening, ladies?
What's up with my lil shorties?
It's your man, Mr. Cannon on the beat

[Romeo:]
Yeah

[Nick Cannon:]
I'm here with Romeo

[Romeo:]
O.K

[Nick Cannon:]
He 'bout to tell ya'll some things

[Romeo:]
To all the girls out there
I'm looking like for a Cinderella

[Nick Cannon:]
Yeah
New No Limit
Can I ball?

[Romeo:]
Yeah yeah

[Nick Cannon:]
Talk to 'em, Rome

[Romeo:]
Look
This Young Romey looking for a homey
A little Juliet, who say she'll console me
When I'm all lonely
Knows how to hold me
A little tight, shawty
Know what I mean
Little attitude
But not controlling
With them pink Nike's
And them passion jeans
I need a girl sweet as a dove
First time in my life
I see I need love
New No Limit
Mami no gimmicks
Maybach Benz
Mami jump in it
You remind me of my diamonds
Always shining
I'm flawless, girl
I'm a young Bill Gates
Get all this girl
In my G-4
We could tour the world before I'm 24
I'mma rule the world
And you can be my queen
Yo, that's for real
O.K

[Chorus:]
And if I ev-ever fall in love again
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ev-ever fall in love so true
I will make sure that the lady's just like you
Oh!

[Romeo:]
O.K
I want my shawty to be like you
Sweet and sassy
Someone to write to
Yes, it's quite true
I kinda like you
You say we just friends
But not tonight, boo
Let's pretend you my Cinderella
Have you home by 12:00
Or respect the fellas
Keep you together
In my butter soft weather
Night is young
We could do whatever
I know you see me on the tv shows, videos, big screen
But I'm just Romeo
A real cool dude you should get to know
On a different plateau
Like whoa!
Buying out what's love like Fat Joe
Mami, I know
But I'm willing to grow
To the mountain top
If you willing to go
Don't be scared
Romey take you there
Come on

[Chorus:]
And if I ev-ever fall in love again
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ev-ever fall in love so true
I will make sure that the lady's just like you
Oh!

[Romeo:]
Look
If I ever fall in love
It's all or nothing
No reason for the kids to go and start fronting
Looking for a girl who can press my button
Hit me on the cell
To do a lil' something

Can I ball?
You know it, ma
Playa thin and tall
I'm growing up

It's a new No Limit
Y'all can't flow with us
On my way to school
I got my own bus

And I can't leave home without my chain
Got girls all over screaming out my name
I'm like Tracy Mcgrady
And Yao Ming
I might switch up my team
But I'm still in the game

MVP
So I'm earning that
Searching for a chick who sweep
To put his slipper on her feet

Until then
I'm gonna run the street
Keep spinning these rhymes, Nick
Bring the beat

[Chorus:]
And if I ev-ever fall in love again
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ev-ever fall in love so true
I will make sure that the lady's just like you
Oh!
