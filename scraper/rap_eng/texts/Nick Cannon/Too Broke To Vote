[Nick Cannon]

Everybody I know say they too broke to vote
With all this heavy slave mentality we could've broke the boat
Nobody cares about me
Nobody cares about my family
Nobody cares about my folks
So Nobody gets my vote

Nobody for President
That's my campaign slogan
We got money for wars but can't feed our homeless
The government is hopeless
It's like a reality show
"Real Lives of the House Liars"
Starring Anglo Saxon Christians
Change the channel sound like a bunch of arguing bitches
Switch up, the game-show "America's Next Top Corrupt Judicial System"

For instance, I'm saying look at my options
Voting for office is like picking out which gun you wanna get shot with
These politicians think they battle rappers and they swear they spitting that hot shit!
Gun control, abortion
Civil liberties, extortion
Energy, the economy
Immigration and global warming
But I ain't feeling the Bern
And hell naw I'll never get Trumped
The Clintons had they chance with me, they the reason my cousin still locked up
Mass incarceration it's still fucked up
3 strikes get you 25 to life, nigga good luck
Fuck yo future
Fuck yo daddy
Fuck yo rights
Fuck yo mentality
In actuality, the Constitution said I was just 3/5ths of a man
What's stopping them from saying that again?
The top 3 percent
Over the 13th amendment
Minus the 40 acres plus the rest of my reparations
Yeah they doing that new government math
Watergate to Whitewater, call that a government bath

The law was we couldn't even use the same bathroom
Back then where was your government at?
Behind our backs, ingesting crack in it up
Yup, the government lab
But in our face they wanna cry and sob
And wonder why we shoot and Rob
But guess what? nothing stops a bullet, like a job

And we can't elect without no college
And don't even get me started about the Electoral College
I mean let's be honest that's how they really choose the president and that's facts!
They got y'all confused with these views from Republicans and Democrats

Liberals and Conservatives, man I ain't none of that
I'm hungry, Nigga where the money at?
Cause I'm too broke to vote
I'm too broke to cope
I ain't trying to check no ballots, I'm trying to check this balance on these checking accounts
Y'all being careful, double checking it counts
But Just like Florida it's gonna be another miscount
And once they get to this amount they gonna try to dismount
Flip sides back and forth it's
Political gymnastics like Olympic acrobats
Go for the gold, cause that's who makes the rules
And all this pageantry is just designed for fools
They gonna give you the one they choose

Too big to fail, too rich to lose
And I'm still to broke to vote
So how do we fix this shit then?
Give her away. In the end, is where it begins
So I vote we return the country back to its original owners
The Native Americans!
