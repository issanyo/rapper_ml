[Verse 1]
Hopefully, emotionally, you can cope with this truthful shit I'm about to spit
The realest shit I ever wrote, so please don't judge me for my sins
Cause shit Goddamn it's a lot of them
Shit Goddamn it's a lot of them
Women and pride where should I begin
Women and pride where should I begin
Let's start with '97 in love with Meagan
Good, puppy love, first time ever
She was sayin' wait, even back then had me streesin'
Had a man, had to expect it, so I called her my best friend
But like kids, we had plans for a wedding
But I start pimpin', skippin' church hurt, felt neglected
Was it my mama fault her only child kept gettin' rejected
Move from projects to projects, and wrote me off like credit
Then all of a sudden the unsuspected, fell in love with Alexis
The sex was unprotected, Danika too, we tested
Yup you guessed it, I got her pregnant
Then she miscarried on 9/11
In heaven is where my best is invested
In Jesus name, I told the lord that I learned my lesson
In Hollywood out of element, made a deal with the devil
I promise I'ma be celibate
But shit, you already know that was over hella quick
Now hella chicks that was relevant
Young Cannon was killin' it
Famous, the nameless fucked me for free, a few freaks who sellin' it
Diana turned me around, now I'm back on track
Bible study 7 days a week made me believe she had my back
Never think that she'd mislead and stab me in the back
But I ain't mad
Now my trust issues is at an all-time wack
I don't call chicks back
I'm like fuck all they asses, only pay my taxes
I don't pay no attention to them bitches who flashin'
Those bitches is plastic, we don't love dem hoes
But we lovin' their passion
We love who they wanna be, perfection and fashion
Yeah, my defense mechanism's, milly rockin' and dabbin'
Got me pushin' 'em back and got me pushin' it passed 'em
I was pushin' a Navi and that's when I met Tina
I mean, I mean my ting she was my queen to be
We was two peas and the world happened
What happened? What happened?
Now, I'm rappin'
Got caught up with sauce and them awesome bitches I bagged 'em
But had I known I would damage our magic
I promise I would never ever ever would've pulled them tricks
Cut to Ms. Thomas when I saw her 2006
Tried to holler, but I thought she was in love with another libra nigga
I can't lie I think I'm fascinated with these R&B singers
Ever since I used to stalk Brandy on the set of "Moesha"
Met Ray J's stylist, she was smilin' and creepin'
She was bout it, I was bout it, now let's go get pizza
Kim was the flyest chick
I get why Kanye be wylin' and tweakin'
The most photographed woman since Mona Lisa
But that pornographic feature had my ego depleted
My agents callin' me screamin', that I don't need it
So I retreated to Las Vegas escapin' with Selita
Ready to elope, or hope it was a secret
But Victoria ain't trust her, and I didn't either
Broke my heart and started beffin', fuck it I'm vegan
And everybody thought her ring was the same as the diva's
But you never give queens the same thing, I mean
That's rule number one when puttin' diamonds on their fingers
Before that last trip to Jacob, had to make-up with Scherzinger
Was in love with Nicole, think I still am
Cause she so cold Goddamn
Can't let go, Goddamn
But my dream girl appeared and made it with my soul
We made it 7 years, itchin' man I wanted mo'
Forever was the goal, but this world is throwed
The only thing that keeps me goin is my five-year olds
Something 'bout a child's soul that can find a diamond in coal
My mind's said I gotta have some mo'
Golden
Should I feel guilty cause I'm in love with Brittany
But jesscia's hatin', Jen is angry and Reese is leavin'
Cause my love was so shaky
My words so deceiving
I love 'em all, it's my fault, they don't believe me
Damaged goods, broken wings, my spirit is grieving
Maybe one day I would find someone who loves me for me
Until I meet her, I'll keep singing

[Hook]
I shed so many tears on this song
You know I made it for you
Girl you know that it's true
I do love you
Shed so many tears on this song
You know I made it for you
Girl you know that it's true
I still love you

[Bridge]
You could have a piece of my love
It's waiting for you
Girl it's true
I love you
Never really want to put the blame on you
All I want to do is put my name on you
Aww yeah
And it's my truth, it's my truth
It's my truth girl, can you handle that?

[Hook]
I shed so many tears on this song
You know I made it for you
Girl you know that it's true
I do love you
Shed so many tears on this song
You know I made it for you
Girl you know that it's true
I still love you

[Second Bridge]
I was young and hella reckless
Baby I apologize for all my messin'
Baby, baby I done definitely learned my lesson
Praise the lord and hallelujah
You're the one I wanna do, ya know
Lil mama ill with it
Know I'm hard to deal with
Put up with my bullshit
And she wanna still kick it
Know she wanna kill bitches
When she find them naked pictures
All up on my phone, checkin' questionin' a real nigga

[Bridge]
You could have a piece of my love
It's waiting for you
Girl it's true
I love you

[Hook]
I shed so many tears on this song
You know I made it for you
Girl you know that it's true
I do love you
Shed so many tears on this song
You know I made it for you
Girl you know that it's true
I still love you
