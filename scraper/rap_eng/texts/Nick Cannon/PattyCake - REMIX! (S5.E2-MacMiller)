PattyCake - REMIX

Pat-A-Cake Pat-A-Cake Baker's Man
Bake Me a Cake as Fast as you can
[Nick] REEEMIX! Drop that beat!

[Hook]
Miss Patty got that cake cake cake cake cake
Miss Patty got that cake cake cake cake cake
Miss Patty got that cake cake cake cake cake
Who? Miss Patty! Who? Miss Patty!

[Verse 1: Anthony "Chico" Bean]
I'm the Bakerman and I got a booty collection
But when it comes to Patty she's the best of my selection
She's got cake so big it don't fit inside your hand
And if you was a man you'd come as fast as you can

[Hook]
Miss Patty got that cake cake cake cake cake
Miss Patty got that cake cake cake cake cake
Miss Patty got that cake cake cake cake cake
Who? Miss Patty! Who? Miss Patty!

[Verse 2: Rasika Mathur]
They call me Miss Patty because I got that cake
And boys give me money just to shake it in their face
I shake it in their face with so much style and grace
Make 'em scream so loud they get evicted from their place

[Hook]
Miss Patty got that cake cake cake cake cake
Miss Patty got that cake cake cake cake cake
Miss Patty got that cake cake cake cake cake
Who? Miss Patty! Who? Miss Patty!
