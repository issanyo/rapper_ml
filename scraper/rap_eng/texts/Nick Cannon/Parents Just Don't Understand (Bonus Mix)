Nick Cannon

[Nick Cannon]
Uh, uh
Peace out!

[Lil' Romeo]
You know, parents are all the same no matter time or place
They don't, understand us kids are gon' make some mistakes
So to all you kids, across the land
There's no need to argue parents just don't understand

[Chorus 3LW] (Lil' Romeo)
Na, na, they don't understand
They ain't gon' get it (okay)
No, no, if you feel me (feel me, feel me, feel me, feel me) (okay)

[Nick Cannon]
Peace out!

[Lil' Romeo]
I remember one year my mom took me school shopping
It was me, my brother, my mom and my pop, and my little sister
All hoped in the car - and headed downtown to the gallery mall
My mom started buggin' with the clothes to chose
I didn't say nothing at first, I just turn my nose
She said, "What's wrong? This shirt costs $50!"
I said, "This shirt is whack and it's not worth a dollar"
The next half-hour was the same old thing
My mom buying me clothes from 1993
Then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for a (?) and she bought me (?)
I said, "Mom, whatchu doin'? You ruinin' my rep"
She said, "You're only a kid, you don't have a rep yet"
So to you all the kids, across the land
There's no need to argue, parents just don't understand

[Chorus x2 w/ Lil' Romeo]
Na, na, (c'mon) they don't understand (nah uh they don't understand)
They ain't gon' get it
No, no, if you feel me
Holla all you kids across the land (uh)

[Nick Cannon]
Uh, underdig the sitaution
Moms bounced out for a weeks vacation
And she left the keys to the 5 double O
Would she mind? Hmm... well, how she gon' know?
I just get a Benzo, Lord spins
See what it look like with 20 inch rims
Then I be THE MAN in my neighborhood
Well, maybe I shouldn't - yeah course I should
You payin' attention cause the plot gets hot
Yo, I pull the whip up to the end of the block
That's when I saw this dom piece startin' in my grill
My diamond rings blairin' from the steerin' wheel
Then she tryin' to pretend like she ain't notice Nick
So I blow her a kiss like I know this chick

[Kiely]
Um... was that for me?

[Nick]
Yeah, you know it huh?
Come take a ride with the young Billy Dee Williams

[Kiely]
How do I know? You look sick
You could be some kind of lunatic

[Nick]
Aw, c'mon sugah, it's Nick from Nick
Besides would a lunatic push a whip like this?

[Chorus w/ Lil' Romeo & Nick Cannon]

[Kiely]
I agreed we were on our way
He was lookin' real good
So ? I must say
Who's car is this?
I'm a little curious

[Nick]
So I stepped on the gas, fast and furious

[Kiely]
Wasn't impressed with the way he burned rubber
The car phone rang

[Nick]
Yo, who is it?

[Kiely]
Your mother

[Nick]
On the phone wild'n, the way my moms sounded
[Kiely and Nick]
There was no way to avoid being grounded

[Nick]
I can't believe it, I just made a mistake
Well, parents are the same
No matter time or place

[Kiely and Nick]
So to you all the kids, across the land
Take from me - parents just don't understand
