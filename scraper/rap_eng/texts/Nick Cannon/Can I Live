Can I live?
I'm talking, ma
I know this situation is personal
But it's something that has to be told
As I was making this beat
You was all I could think about
You heard my voice
Yeah, uh huh
Just think, just think
What if you could just
Just blink your self away
Just, just wait, just pause for a second
Let me plead my case

It's the late 70's, huh
You seventeen, huh
And having me, that will ruin everything huh
It's a lot of angels waiting on their wings
You see me in your sleep so you can't kill your dreams
Three hundred dollars, that's the price of living? What?
Mommy, I don't like this clinic
Hopefully you'll make the right decision
And don't go though with the knife decision
But it's hard to make the right move when you in high school
Now you gotta work all day and take night school
Hopping on the bus and the rain is pouring
What you want morning sickness or the sickness of mourning?
Can I live?

[Hook - Anthony Hamilton]
I'll always be a part of you
Trust your soul, know it's always true
If I could talk I'd say to you
Can I live?
Can I live?

I'll always be a part of you
Trust your soul, know it's always true
If I could talk I'd say to you
Can I live?
Can I live?

[Nick Cannon]
I'm a child of the king, ain't no need to go fear me
And I see the flowing tears so I know that you hear me
When I move in your womb that's me being scared
Cuz who knows where my future holds
Yo, the truth be told you ain't told a soul
Yo, you ain't even showing, I'm just two months old
Through your clothes try to hide me, deny me
Went up three sizes, your pride got you lying
Saying ain't nothing but a migraine
It ain't surprising you not trying to be in Wic Food lines
Your friends look at you funny but look at you mommy
That's a life inside, take a look at your tummy
What is becoming, ma? I'm Oprah bound
You can tell he a star from the Ultrasound
Our spirits connected, doors open now
Nothing but love and respect
Thanks for holding it down, she let me live

It's uplifing for real, y'all
I ain't passing no judgement, ain't making no decisions
I'm just telling y'all my story
I love life
And I love my mother for giving me life
We all need to appreciate life
And a strong woman who had to make a sacrifice
Thanks for listening
Thanks for listening!
Momma, thanks for listening
