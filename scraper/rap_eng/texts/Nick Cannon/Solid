[Hook - Nick Cannon]
Niggas wanna be solid but they ain't solid
Niggas wanna be solid but they ain't solid

Niggas wanna be solid but they ain't solid
Part time bitches dont fuck with them

Dont be safe, be solid my nigga

Dont be safe, be solid my nigga
Con, Clips, Hitman Holla on the trigger

[Verse 1 - Nick Cannon]
I dont know what they talkin´ about
Cuz´ if it ain't no bitch in you want no bitch come out
Niggas wanna be sharks when the fish is out
Heard the feds reading lips nigga watch your mouth
Niggas wanna be solid but they ain't solid
Gotta teach em´ how to move how to walk up out it
Cuz´ if you talk about put some funk around it
Tell a nigga lay down and put some chalk around it
Dont be safe, be solid my nigga
Cuz´ i dont think you really want these problems lil nigga
This southeast Nick from the bottoms lil nigga
And i ain't gotta do it, Slick or Holla gon´ kill ya

[Verse 2 - Charlie Clips]
Let a westcoast nigga do the walking
Now let a eastcoast nigga do the talking
Both sides collide we gon´ put you in a coffin
Two shots from each side nigga thats a foursome
Pardon me im in a orgie
I was taught to never blend salmon with the porkie
Niggas act fishy and they salty
Hook em´ with real lines, falling for the bait like you caught me
Dont be safe be solid my nigga

You gon´ lose weight when shot to the noggin´ my nigga
And dont worry bout your life god got it my nigga

[Verse 3 - Hitman Holla]
Riddle me this i think i list some

Man i fish some or headshot [?]
Short spasses [?]
All these shooters i call it million march madness
Deuce with the forty, nine with the phones
I let my guns [?] ain't worried bout my clones
Yeah, 2 on 1 got a few slice left
We double baggin´ funerals yellin´ who got next?
