Ayo K, it's a lot of conversation out there
So let's get to it
Gospel of Ike Turn Up

[Hook: K Michelle]
So I'm havin' your baby
And it means so much to me
There's nothing more precious
Than to raise a family, yeah
I wonder what your ex gon' say
When she find out you got a baby on the way
I wonder what my ex gon' say
When he find out you got this baby on the way

[Verse 1: Nick Cannon]
Uh oh, what we gon' do?
My baby mama don't know about you
But I love you, I love you
Ever since we met in 2002
Yeah you had a dude and I was hella rude
Jiggilo shit and Ike Turner, Malibu
But now you into me and I'm so happy
'Bout to have a lil baby with my last name
