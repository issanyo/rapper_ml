(Intro)
Talk to your girl dog she down for you you just got to make sure
You down for her

(Verse 1 (Nick Cannon))
We was doin from day one a feeling that i couldn't escape from
Seems like a dream i don't wanna await from alot of things
That i can't get away from alot of stress i just wanna erase em
You da reason why i'm hard at work you think my job is
Chasin baller skirts i ain't got to search baby doll you're
First see you got this touch that revolve to earth i know you
Sweat when i'm out on tour i was max and maturable and adorable
For alot of balls to step from my hotel door couldn't even
Recall what i go there for but i was much younger much dumber
Out of touch so i bring my less on the summer crazy amazingly
You forgave me turn around and say to me

(Chorus (Mary J. Blige))
Whenever you need me babe just call my name no matter whatever
You done you know that i'll be there i'm down for you
Whatever you're goin through whenever you need me babe you know
That i'll be there

(Verse 2 (Nick Cannon))
Yo every man needs a rider beside her my rider to is clinon was
To pick em up off the bottom whatever he need she got em
And vise versa even though his style might hurt her a phone call
Is a phone call to a fella but to women it falls under the
Same umbrella it's trust plus honesty respect gotta jugle em all
Try not to neglect cuz if something go wrong it be hard to
Correct they forgive but never forget no matter how many
Diamonds you sit on they neck you look at invisible set they be
They be invisible next that's why i hold my home team down no
Matter how much of this world i'm going around i'm gonna treat
You da right way it always feel good when you say...

(Chorus (Mary J. Blige))
Whenever you need me babe just call my name no matter whatever
You done you know that i'll be there i'm down for you
Whatever you're goin through whenever you need me babe you know
That i'll be there

(Verse 3)
Now as soon as the media get a hold of the vocal they gonna try
Figure the motive the reason i wrote who da girl on my arm
At the movie premiere who da one in the drop with the wind in
Her hair poparatzzi
Watch but to see pops don't like me and thats wherever i might
Be so i need a girl to stand and to understand and stand
Next to cannon cuz i got a plan and i ain't tryin put no weight
On ya girl but it's hard to have alove affair in front of
The world everytime you move every step you make bein watched
Possibly videotaped that's why i need a place where i can
Escape from and another soul and wich my soul can relate and i
Probably make a lot of mistakes but i still need to hear
Somebody say...

(Chorus (Mary J. Blige))
Whenever you need me babe just call my name no matter whatever
You done you know that i'll be there i'm down for you
Whatever you're goin through whenever you need me babe you know
That i'll be there

Whenever you need me babe just call my name no matter whatever
You done you know that i'll be there i'm down for you
Whatever you're goin through whenever you need me babe you know
That i'll be there

Whenever you need me babe just call my name no matter whatever
You done you know that i'll be there i'm down for you
Whatever you're goin through whenever you need me babe you know
That i'll be there
