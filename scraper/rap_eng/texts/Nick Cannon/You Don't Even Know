You dont hear me, even tho you say you really feel me babay
In my mind I can't stop thinking
That you don't know you got my head up in the sky

Everyday that goes by wen I'm with chu
Every minute I spend with chu
Oh how bad it hurts
Just to think it wouldn't werk
I confess im into you, do what chu want me to
Boi u dont know just how bad im wantin you

You dont even know how im feelin you (you dont even know)
That I want cha, wanna be withcha babay
You dont even know how im feelin you (you dont even know)
That I need chu, gotta have u

Now I'm secretly feelin you, I want chu to know baby
That I wanna be yo lady yea
Not talkn just anythang, wanna be your everythang
Cum on now play with me boii, wanna bring you so much joy

Everyday that goes by wen im with chu
Every minute I spend with chu
Oh how bad it hurts
Just to think it wouldn't werk
I confess im into you, do what chu want me to
Boi u dont know just how bad im wantin you

You dont even know how im feelin you (you dont even know)
That I want cha, wanna be withcha babay
You dont even know how im feelin you (you dont even know)
That I need chu, gotta have u

Keep callin chiccenheadz from pasadena to madena
In my white beama, pull u over like trina
Yo I take em all sizes vita to misdeamenor
But Nivea wen I seen ya, ugh u had me open like Vick's vapor rub
Nick made chu love, den wakin up, u hook ur egg and bacon up
Nick got chiccs feelin really really dumb
Cuz they dont know bout u feelin me, im feelin u what

Well if u feelin what im spittin we gon kicc it tonight
Ain't no need in wastin tyme boy I told chu ur fly
We can roll out and we can wild out, letz get crazy
Can't see no other lady, den me callin u baby
Itz really truly devastatin dat chu wanna take my hand
I had chu on my mind thinkn bout how we would vibe
Whyla it ain't no secret, I put it out there on the line
How im feelin ur style, ill go that extra mile

You dont even know how im feelin you (you dont even know)
That I want cha, wanna be withcha babay
You dont even know how im feelin you (you dont even know)
That I need chu, gotta have u
