Yeah Ike Turn Up
AKA Lord Incredible Almighty
Or just call me General Cornball Wallace
Cause my wallets a problem
Cause it's fucking up my posture
Cause my dollars is taller
But y’all niggas don't see that
All y’all see is a nigga paraplegic
I can't stand seeing niggas get defeated
When they see another nigga eatin
Please be seated
Yo Rob come and mark these mans and let ‘em know they in the presence of a real genius
I mean this
Shoot, my kingdom reigns supreme over demons
I'm a leader
That's no secret
I’m Victorious
Nigga ask Selita
Or Adriana Lima
Like 4:55 I’ma lean ya
A Ethiopian God speaking Amarinya
But you haters in my comments tweakin like I ain’t spittin’ ether
Talking ‘bout
I didn’t know Nick Cannon was this hot
Ya nigga me either
So you twats keep tweeting
I got your block fiending
I got niggas leaking
Heroin flow, lethal injection
And my words got you bleedin’
Type 2 diabetes
You niggas is sugar and the Cannon’s unsweetened
Call me bitter, how you spitting for no reason?
The Chairman's achieving
The comedy corny nigga that have your parents grieving
But don't compare me to Jesus
Because if I walk on water
Haters'll claim I can't swim
Damn
I’m a genius
