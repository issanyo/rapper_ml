[Chorus]
Oh oh oh - I must be lookin' for a dream
Oh oh oh - I must be lookin' for a dream
Oh oh oh - I must be lookin' for a dream
In my head - I must be lookin' for a dream
Oh oh oh - I must be lookin' for a dream
Oh oh oh - I must be lookin for a dream
In my head

[Verse 1]
Pullin' up in a Cadillac
Yea, my old life, mama they can have it back
We tearin' up the club, can you handle that?
With a beat like that from Afrojack
Yea, he the man, battlecat
Keep it old school, mama do the cabbage patch
Whap, drop, shake that ass
Then put em on the glass while I throw this cash

[Pre-Chorus]
If you getting money put yo hands up in high-igh-igh
It's falling from the ceiling, yea the feelings fly-y-y
I see the things and I'm gon get it till it's mine
It's my dream, I'm gon live it up tonight

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
My life is so amazing
All this money, all these ladies
Long as I got my baby
I say long as I got my baby
Baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
