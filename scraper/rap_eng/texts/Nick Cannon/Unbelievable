[Verse 1:]
You remember when you loved it, loved it
You remember them 90’s song
Remember when you jocked it, jocked it
All night, all night on the phone
Remember talking, talking till they cut my minutes off
You remember when you stalked it
Wait a minute baby I got that wrong
I remember you had me sprung, you remember us walking home
Remember your daddy walking out was tryna kick it
But you got to dippin when the street lights came on
Remember playing hide and go get it
I remember you eskimo kisses
You remember your mommas Honda, the first place that you let me hit it

[Pre-Chorus:]
Smokin on that, smokin on that oh wee
Rollin in my ole school hooptie
Hopin the chance to make you move your booty, your booty, your booty

[Chorus:]
This is my song for real no doubt, said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
Women on  to the dance floor[x5]

[Verse 2:]
Remember Sega Genesis, remember Mary’s Reminisce
Remember Tommy Hilfiger, Polo on my tennis shoes
Remember R. Kelly when he was with Public Announcement
Remember that first time that you heard a remix
Remember Honey Love, remember Bump N Grind
Remember 12 Play but we only made it till nine
You remember curfews, remember you was scared to move
I remember that first time, first time I didn’t wanna hurt you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Remember high school but I was only five two
I remember when you use to have a crush on all them older fly dudes
Remember your best friend, yea i liked her too
Remember French class, merci ver coo
Remember trapper keepers, remember pencil fight
Remember [?] pop rock and tyre nights
Remember summer time, remember corn rows
Remember you said you’d hold me down even though I was a gigolo

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
