[Intro: Nick Cannon]
I feel like I’m famous
You don’t need no money
You don’t need no talent
You don’t need no furs
You don’t need no diamonds
You don’t need no girls
You don’t need no cars
When the beat drop show em you a superstar

[Chorus: Nick Cannon]
Bounce, bounce, like you famous
Jump, jump, like you famous
Shake, shake, like you famous
Dance, dance, like you famous
Drink, drink, like you famous
Fuck, fuck, like you famous
Pose, pose, like you famous
Hold up, bitch I'm famous

[Verse 1: Akon]
Just looking at you, I can see a star
Gotta tell you girl I’m impressed ‘bout how you are
Everything is lining up perfect with no flaw
The only thing you need is someone like me involved

To break you all down, I know you’ve been waiting all day
Just get rid of those clowns and i will show you the way
Stop hanging around, we can paint this town
Until the lights come down on you and make you famous

[Verse 2: Akon]
Ohh, Girl, I can make you famous
Best believe I can make you famous
Ohh, Girl, I can make you famous
Best believe I can make you famous
Ohh, Girl, I can make you famous
Best believe I can make you famous
Ohh, Girl, I can make you famous
Bitch, I’m famous

I feel like I’m famous
(I'm freaking freaking famous!)
I feel like I’m famous
(I'm freaking freaking famous!)

Lights, stars, money, cars
Lights, stars, money, cars
Lights, stars, money, cars
When this beat drop let them know who you are

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Nick Cannon]
(I feel like I’m famous)
When I'm broke in a ma'fucka drove to the club
In an ugly old school V-dub bucket
(I feel like I’m famous)
I don't give a fuck, I'm buying out the bar
That seventeen, thirty eight Remy Mar'
Party hard, I'mma call three broads
In my Adidas
No Louis Vuitton dawg, these knock-offs
I'm tryin' to get my papers like Peter Popoff
Late night BET need a bear cloth
Save my money like four grandmas
Sex tapes like I'm wrestling [?]?
Smoke weed, doing shots, it ain't my fault, so

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I feel like I’m famous
(That seventeen, thirty eight got me going)
I feel like I’m famous
(That seventeen, thirty eight got me going)
