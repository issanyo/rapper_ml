[Verse One: Nick Cannon]
You remember when you loved a nigga?
You remember them 90s songs?
Remember when you jocked a nigga?
Spending all night, all night on the phone
Remember talking, talking
'Till they cut my minutes off?
You remember when you stalked a nigga?
Wait a minute maybe I got that wrong
I remember you had me sprung
You remember us walking home?
Remember your daddy walking always tryin' to kick it but you always got to dippin''
When them streetlights came on
Remember playin hide 'n' go get it?
I remember your eskimo kisses
You remember your mommas Honda?
First place that you let me hit it
