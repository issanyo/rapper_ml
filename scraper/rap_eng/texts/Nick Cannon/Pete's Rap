[Pete]
Man, I have some hidden talents, Nick. I have bars for days

[Nick Cannon]
What are you talking about?

[Pete]
I rap, man. I just don't tell anybody

[Nick Cannon]
What do you mean?

[Pete]
I'm, uh, I'm pretty good. I have songs

[Nick Cannon]
Really?

[Pete]
Yeah

[Nick Cannon]
Like what's a title of one?

[Pete]
Um, I *beep* all *beep* everybody. I talk about *beep* all girls, ugly ones. Because they're there. And someone needs to *beep* them. You know what I'm saying?

Oh yeah and one of them is, the chorus is:

I'm *beep* everybody
I'm *beep* everybody
While she rock Kmart Obugari
I'm *beep* everybody

Uh, that's one of the things, and the verse is:

I'm *beep* these *beep* around the world
You turn your back and I take your girl
My *beep* goes so far down her *beep*
That I guarantee that she goin' hurl
Okay *beep* now clean it up
You know me I don't give a *beep*
Get lost girl I'm not a squirrel
I won't chase you if you take my nuts

That's one of them, and then, uh - you know what I'm saying? I can rap, man. I just don't - you know - I know my lane. That's all
