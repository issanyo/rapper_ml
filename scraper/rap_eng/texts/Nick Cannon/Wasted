[Intro: Nick Cannon]
Gucci Mane, and Ike Turn Up in this motherfucker (x3)
Gucci Mane, Ike, Ike Turn Up in this motherfucker

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Started out local, but I ain't motherfuckin' local
Got 2 million worth of jewelry on one of six sofas
Got a pocket full of 50's like a damn club promoter
And these coppers wanna see me on a most wanted poster (Gucci Man)
Who are you supposed to be? ('Posed to be?)
Say that you's an OG, but really
Nigga you just O.V, O.V
I'm cooking dope in L.V, Lil' [?]
Remix a brick in double G's, Gucci
I just sold a thousand P's, in Vendi
My sweater and my drawers and my jeans Burberry
Coconut Ciroc mixed with Molly Cranberry

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
(Wasted!) Coconut
(Wasted!) Coconut Ciroc I'm
(Wasted!) Coconut
(Wasted!) Coconut Ciroc mixed with molly cranberry

[Verse 2: Nick Cannon]
And it got a little kick to it
I don't drink, but my chicks do it
Fucked up, let's get to it
On purp, like I meant to do it
Switchin' my bitch with it's a movie
She standing still but her ass movin'
She ain't gettin' shit for Christmas like her ass Jewish
Girl you better ring them bells, club don't close 'til 'round 2-ish
First round, knock it out, I don't ever round two it
Might go and fuck your friend if I get around to it
Goo-la-goo menage-a-trois, know you like the sound to it
When it come to speakin' pimpin' you know that I'm supa fluent
Give me head, super do it
In her mouth, not her booty
I don't care that's super fruity, stupid niggas got 'em stuck
What the fuck, super glue'd it, smokin' on that hallelujah

[Bridge]
The white girl, know she came to get lit
The black girl, right up on my dick
(Wasted)
These chicks, they think they the shit
But everybody in this bitch and we 'bout to get
