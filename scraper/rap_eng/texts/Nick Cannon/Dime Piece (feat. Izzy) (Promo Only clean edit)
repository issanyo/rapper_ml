(Chorus:)
It's driving me outta my mind
That's why it's so hard for me to find
(Repeat)

(Verse 1)
Dime piece definition of a chick
Nice, sweet educated independent fly thang
Way she fillin up dem jeans gotta tear drop like Visine
Like WHOOP shawty stuck it out had da touch it
OOPS I could make it juz jump in my COUPE
Wit a diamonds and jewels
I see Jimmy Choo in yo designer shoes
Momma listen u ain't neva heard a flow like diz one
Who u kno Gigalo and still Christian
Lil shawty stop trippin if Don once a bishop
Why Nick can't be pimpin
PLEASE I'm juz trynna get you in VIN-KISS
Wait take a minute take a flick juz FREEZE
Cuz u kno da Cannon be flashin I'm gettin more head den a aspirin

(Chorus:)
It's driving me outta my mind (Hey Ladies)
That's why it's so hard for me to find (Hey Ladies)
(Repeat)

(Verse 2 (Izzy))

And I ain't got time but to get brain from a dime

(Chorus:)
It's driving me outta my mind (Hey Ladies)
That's why it's so hard for me to find (Hey Ladies)
(Repeat)

If you fly get a drink ill buy it (Hey, Hey)

Cuz I like it, I love it, can I ball on the beat make a club hit

(Verse 3)
It's like taste, wut lick who

Do wut a pimp do move how a pimp do move
Get a tatoo ma use my intitals

(Chorus:)
It's driving me outta my mind (Hey Ladies)
That's why it's so hard for me to find (Hey Ladies)
(Repeat)
Are you a dime?
