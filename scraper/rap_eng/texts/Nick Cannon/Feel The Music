[Hook: Colette Carr]
Feel the music
It's a fucking party
Feel the music
Move your body (body)
Feel the music
It's a fucking party
Feel the music
Move your body body body yeah

[Post Hook: Nick Cannon]
When the freaks come out to party rock the night away
If you came to move your body let me hear you say
Oh la la (oh la la) oh la la (oh la la hey)
Lets get it cracking tonight


[Hook]

[Verse 1 : Nick Cannon]
T-t-t-two, four, six, eight
H-h-h-haters can't appreciate
A-ain't nothin but a party
Party with a bunch of bodies
B-b-bodies on the dance floor
Flow is going ham so
Throw your hands th-th-throw your hands
Th-th-throw your hands in the air
