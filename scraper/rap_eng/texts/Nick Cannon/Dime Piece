[Hook]
It's driving me outta my mind
That's why it's so hard for me to find
(Repeat)

[Verse 1]
Dime piece definition of a chick
Nice, sweet educated independent fly thang
Way she fillin' up them jeans gotta tear drop like Visine
Like WHOOP shawty stuck it out had da touch it
OOPS I could make it just jump in my COUPE
Wit a diamonds and jewels
I see Jimmy Choo in your designer shoes
Mama listen u ain't never heard a flow like this one
Who you know Gigolo and still Christian
Little shawty stop trippin' if Don once a bishop
Why Nick can't be pimpin'
PLEASE I'm just tryna get you in VIN-KISS
Wait take a minute take a flick just FREEZE
Cause you know the Cannon be flashin' I'm gettin' more head then a aspirin
I'm askin' are you a dime the dime

[Hook]
It's driving me outta my mind (Hey ladies)
That's why it's so hard for me to find (Hey ladies)
(Repeat)
Are you a dime?

[Verse 2: Izzy]
You looking for a dime
Izz gotta a 9 da dick put em high
Call a Nina Sky money over dare
And I ain't got time but to get brain from a dime
Now that's changin' your mind
My dick feels for you like Chaka Khan
Flip head and tails when I tossin' your mind
They call me Izzy you know
Single the I then double the Z den say it wit a Y
Where all my ladies that single the night
At the strip club got me throwing singles the nght
The boy poison the beat be the IV on the mic
What them dime say when Iz on the mic
(Go Izzy, Go Izzy) Feeling me why can't even name all the 10's on the mic
That Ronda, Bonnie, Vicky, with choice
Is she a born again wit some dick in her life
Is you a dime the dime?

[Hook]


[Bridge]
All the ugly chicks be quiet (Hey, hey)
If you fly get a drink i'll buy it (Hey, hey)
At the end of the night I might hit (Hey, hey)
Cause I like it, I love it, can I ball on the beat make a club hit

[Verse 3]
It's like taste, what lick who
That's what Nick do
Got a lot of chicks dat love my sick moves
Do what a pimp do move how a pimp do move
Get a tattoo ma use my initials
Now we got issues and rumors the clear up
Sex real loud next room they can here us
I'm lookin for a dime dat can take the whole 9
Check the sex tapes if you think I'm lyin'
Are you a dime the dime

[Hook]
It's driving me outta my mind (Hey ladies)
That's why it's so hard for me to find (Hey ladies)
(Repeat)
