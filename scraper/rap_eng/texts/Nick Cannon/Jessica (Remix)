[Chorus: Ty Money]
I whip it and whip it and whip it,  do that on the regular
That loud pack I'm smokin', that OG from Oakland irregular
Everything these niggas do, that shit be regular
I don't know what that bitch name is but I think it's Jessica
Jessica (Jessica), Jessica (Jessica)
I whip it and whip it and whip it, I named that bitch Jessica
Jessica (Jessica), Jessica (Jessica)
I don't know what this bitch name is but I think it's Jessica

[Verse 1: Ty Money]
Jessica, Jessica
I take that bitch out the pot, I gotta measure her
I put that bitch on the block, them young niggas sellin' her
I don't remember her name but I think it was Jessica
Fuckin' with Jessica, Jessica
Fuck with that bitch, she gon' set you up
Them niggas gon' come to wet you up
They get you down, ain't no lettin' up
My nigga lived through real situations
These niggas die over petty stuff
I'm in my traphouse, I'm packin' up
Got rearview cameras when I'm backin' up
Jessica, show you what them commas do
Put money on a nigga head, he be dead by the morning, I promise you
Fuck nigga go get you some money, why you worried 'bout what I'ma do?
You can get work how you want it, Jessica's optional

[Chorus: Ty Money]
I whip it and whip it and whip it,  do that on the regular
That loud pack I'm smokin', that OG from Oakland irregular
Everything these niggas do, that shit be regular
I don't know what that bitch name is but I think it's Jessica
Jessica (Jessica), Jessica (Jessica)
I whip it and whip it and whip it, I named that bitch Jessica
Jessica (Jessica), Jessica (Jessica)
I don't know what this bitch name is but I think it's Jessica

[Verse 2: Nick Cannon]
(Guess I gotta talk to her)
Jessica, Jessica
I gotta confess that your pussy is better than all of the rest of 'em
All of my other bitches be like Nick, why do you mess with her?
'Cause when we fuck I bust a nut and put the whole twelve in her
Jessica, she model professional
Sexin' butt-naked in the back of the whip, that shit is incredible
Finesse and undress and caress on her breast
And I'm checkin' to see if she regular
That type you might wanna wife and get pregnant
Sike, I got on protection ho
Jessica, sexy or sexual, that bitch'll let you know
She the best in the bed when it comes to the head
That shit is exceptional (intellectual)
My nigga I swear to God, whip that pussy like a child
I can't come home with no money, that's that shit Jessica just won't allow
I whip it and whip it and whip it

[Chorus: Ty Money]
I whip it and whip it and whip it,  do that on the regular
That loud pack I'm smokin', that OG from Oakland irregular
Everything these niggas do, that shit be regular
I don't know what that bitch name is but I think it's Jessica
Jessica (Jessica), Jessica (Jessica)
I whip it and whip it and whip it, I named that bitch Jessica
Jessica (Jessica), Jessica (Jessica)
I don't know what this bitch name is but I think it's Jessica

[Outro: Nick Cannon]
I had to do it
Yeah, gang
They gon' be talkin' 'bout this
Haha, yo Ty
Girls be like I bet you think this song is about you
