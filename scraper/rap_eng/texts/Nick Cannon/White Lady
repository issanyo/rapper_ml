[Intro:]
Go whitegirl, go whitegirl[x5]

[Chorus:]
So won’t you shake it like a white lady, white lady
No no don’t fake it do it right lady, right lady
I see you dancing like a white lady, white lady
Don’t be ashamed cause your white lady, white lady
Oh no no no

[Verse 1:]
When I first see her move, I couldn’t tell what she was doing
It looked like her body was in a state of confusion
She staring bumpin and humpin
You might have thought she gon crazy
I said somebody help me and come and get this old lady

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
I don’t know how to say this girl
But this is my party girl and it’s my world
And you don’t got no riddim pretending to get offended, girl
Don’t get mad this dance is simple, girl
From the right to the left now the middle, girl
Now rock don’t stop till you get it, girl
Hold on wait, are you dancing to the words
What beat are you on, one step at a time, lets go
Cause I don’t wanna lose your love
And when it comes to the drum I wanna use your love
Cause your two left shoes got me doing supm
And that white girl groove got you acting up
And get you back into it now relax your muscle
A white woman got swag, just ask Russell
We having moves like that since doing the hustle
She just said woiii, now she  she making me touch her
Up goes the shirt now she’s girls gone wild
Thanks to Barrack she thinks I’m hot now
Doing your dance, do your dance
Do it right, right, right
It don’t matter, it don’t matter if your white, white, white
Doing your dance, do your dance
Do it right, right, right
Here’s your chance, here’s your chance tonight

[Chorus:]
C’mon just shake it like a white lady, white lady
No no don’t fake it do it right lady, right lady
I see you dancing like a white lady, white lady
Don’t be ashamed cause your white lady, white lady
Oh no no no

[Bridge:]
I see you rock your hips now pop your shoulder right
Keep it comin with the white woman over there (repeat x2)

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Come on just shake it like a white lady, white lady (repeat x10)
