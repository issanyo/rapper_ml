[Intro: Nick Cannon]
Black Squad
If you had 24 hours to live, how would you live yo life
Hitman Holla
Charlie Clips
And that boy Conceited

[Verse 1: Conceited]
If I had 24 hours to live, I'd prolly want a quickie
And go make Rihanna gimme a minaj wit Nicki
Tell Bill Gates it might go off and rob all his hard cash till his Mic grow Soft
Then I prolly split it and give it out to my whole fam
My mother get the most, second be my old man
Bust in every girl I fuck, I'm doing things
So my son could last to 24 and do the same

[Verse 2: Hitman Holla]
If I had 24 hours live, what would I do first? I'll prolly kidnap Hov just to do a verse
'Cause I know I'd be next, I'll get the publishing to my son so he could get the royalty checks
Then call Smack, we could talk like mans supposed to
I squash shit then I battle free for the culture
Then run in Madison Square Garden wit a snub and a Glock
Phil Jackson give my lil brotha a shot
Rob a bank for the hood, I got love for the block
Then my next plan, well I love my mother a lot
So I'm at the White House, you know lookin for Obama
I'on want no drama, just need a cure for my momma
Then I'm out with no hesitation
All the racist cops we be facing, tell em I'm at the station
Darren Wilson the one who killed Mike Brown
Knock-knock guess what I'm at his crib right now
Snatch him up then I might attack him for the power
I won't even kill him, just smack him for a hour
Wit the 9 [?]
Leave the scene wit the hoodie on for Trayvon
I'm St. Louis but L.A. love me like Taivon
I'm too cool, Eazy E wit the shades on Yeah, and I'ma die in this song so
I'ma hijack a jet and try to fly on my own

[Verse 3: Charlie Clips]
I only got 24 hours to live, I better dip Protest in Madison Square Garden for better Knicks
Tell James Dolan like "yo we need better picks"
And turn this old hoe I know to a better chick
Park the Benz, then I spin a block in the Regal
Knock on Obama door like "Bro, we need you"
"The president we got right now be actin evil"
Climb that fake wall that Trump built for the people
You know what, nevermind that, don't rewind that
Spent too much time on dude, can't get that time back
Take a blunt to the face and get my head blown
Run to RadioShack, steal NCredible headphones
Turn 'em up loud, yeah I turn 'em up loud #
Run to my momma crib then throw her a hunnid thou
Then write her a check for a million that's how I'm feeling
Like momma "Why stay in a crib when you own the building?"
And then spend a few hours in a orphanage
And donate my life savings to some orphan kids
Then do 160 on a one way and spend my last five dollars at Subway
Matter of fact, Mickey D's it's gon be a murder
Yeah, I'm vegan, but my last two hours I need a burger
Bag a bad bitch to gimme head while I pray, it's crazy I told you my whole life in a day

[Verse 4: Nick Cannon]
24 hours to live, let's do this
Get a tattoo on my forehead that says "fuck lupus"
Cop a AR and Chris Beckhams for all of my shooters
Run up into NRA yelling "nigga recruit us"
Get all my Wild n' Out girls to take over Hooters
Yo fuck fried chicken we eatin gourmet noodles
Around noon, I'ma really show em 12:00 '
Last lunch wit my disciples, did they sell me out
'Cause Judas can't tell if I'm well or not
Because lately I been talking bout going to hell a lot
So I could steal the Devil's hoes, heard they hella hot
And blow this paper like a bomb in the mailing box
And take these letter to my niggas in jail and watch them scrabble this shit and never catch a L or flop
'Cause you can't spell flop with out the FL, you opp
And when the clock strikes three, I'ma take one knee
And say a quick prayer to Mohammed Ali
Let him know I'm on the way, get the ring ready for me
Float into heaven, butterfly try to sting that bee
No disrespect to the hive but I was born a Lincoln Hornet, represent southeast
Shouts out to Skyline and Damos, ride for me
And to my guys wearing blue, neighborhood Crips throw your C's high for me S
Ese homies represent Damos a qui
Think of donating all my jewelry to Mozambique
See it was theirs to begin with, black and that's facts
Europeans stole their diamonds, they lying they ain't find that
So even if I sold my old gold Rollie, can't get that time back
Only couple hours left to live and shit, if this shit get whack I can't rewind that
So if I fuck up on this track, a nigga gotta keep spittin
And fuck up all you niggas that think my shit is ghost written
You think you hot, then lil nigga step up in the kitchen
You gon leave starving, butt-naked wit less of yo bitches
This the last supper, you niggas lookin like dinner
Aww nigga, now I'm gettin thinner and thinner
Never thought I'd be a killer but this world made me a sinner
So before the night is finished imma say the same shit like a synonym
Twice niggas, slice niggas
Coming off the rack, spice niggas you cinnamon
Gingerbread bitches got you chewing yo fingers man
Next then imma inject this insulin into George Zimmerman
Buy Trayvon's murder weapon back from him and shoot that nigga live on Twitter man
Goddamn someone must've put the venom in my rhythm
'Cause in the middle of killing him I could feel my ADD kicking in
My mind is time bomb and the shit went from ticking man to tick-tick-tick-ticking man
Born again Christian but right now I ain't feeling him
They such a contradiction, convertin' to Islam
Turban they wanna brim, my light they wanna dim, my mic they wanna trim, Kanye they wanna Kim
Might have to sacrifice the goat yo
Yeah you heard em I'm murdering Eminem
They gon be like "oh shit, you heard what he did to Slim"
Pissin all the white people off like that White Bay shit again
I mean what I got to lose, couple hours left
Run up into Trump Towers and buy or rent all his chefs
'Cause the boys need feeding, he's got us dying and leading a slow death
And with my last breaths, I'm wishing all my bitches a last happy anniversary
Take my last hunnid million and build a children's hospital nursery
Lastly before they bring the Hearse for me, I'ma tell em pull over and go to the studio purposely
So I could give all you new rappers a verse for me
Oh yeah, fuck my bad I'm a good dad so to let y'all know how much my kids is worth to me
I'ma go school shopping and buy Howard University
