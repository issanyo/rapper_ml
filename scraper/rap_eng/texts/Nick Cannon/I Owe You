Uh this real (its you that i owe)
I owe you (said i owe you)

They say the ones you take for granted
You miss the most
Woke up every mornin to grits and toast
School clothes spread
At the foot of the bed
Anything that i needed was there
You get it prepared (yea) (you did it for me)
Held it down when my pops and moms ain't
Repay you in a way
That stocks and bonds caint
Jus think
Its that same little boy that used to break rules
Spill kool-aid on the floor
You was my father and my mother
The mother of my father
Known as my grandmother
I reffer to you as mama
Noone calmer or conciderit
As you my dear
Love my parents just as much
But lets get one thing clear
You raised me by choice and you didn't have to (mama)
Showed me where to go when i had to use the bathroom
Nasty thats true classy thats you (mama)
Id give you my last breath if i had to

(chorus:)
When i stop,look back think about my life
You gave me your love weather wrong or right
Ooo i owe you come on I owe you (its you that i owe)
When i was down and out
And all my friends was gone
You stayed by my side never left me alone
Ooo i owe you (its you that i owe) (i owe you) I owe you
(its you that i owe) (yes i do)

Bethany, Sharron hack it
Kept me wearing jackets
Started triple phat
Mama kept with the fashions
Everlasting love
Couldent ask enough
Went to school, two jobs just to have for us
Plus no child support, you did it on your own
Independent women you the queen of my throne
(you did it for me)
Condos to one bedroom we called home
Long as you was there i was never alone
Though we had our ups and downs
Its all up now
You used to wear small frowns
Tear them all up now (How?)
Did you imagine ma
That your son would grow up to be this handsome huh?
No im playn im sayn you the reason i exist
And for this mess you deserve pure bliss
Any wish ill grant it
Any diss ill slam it
You my all understand it
You son Nick Cannon

(Chorus)
Lord, heavenly father
I praise your soul
Learned to love you for myself when i was eight years old
Before then i didn't about your grace and mercy
I just knew my pops was preaching
While i played in the nursery
Then he taught me that you so loved us all
That you sent your only son to die on a cross
I once was lost but you keep finding me
I always fall but you keep reminding me

Verse john 1:9 that im right you see
And it'll be just fine you took a liking to me
Gotta let'em all know
You can still have fun
Lord in the reins rove you ride shotgun
Saved me in that crash
Blocked bullets when they blast
That night at the party
Know they got the homie
No you got him surely
And as for me if it wasn't for yall i dont know where i would be

When i stop,look back think about my life
You gave me your love weather wrong or right
Ooo i owe you come on (nobody told you to do it for me yeaaa) I owe you
When i was down and out
And all my friends was gone (you loved me)
You stayed by my side never left me alone
Ooo i owe you (oh) (your my savior) (i owe you)

When i stop, look back think about my life
You gave me your love weather wrong or right
Ooo i owe you come on (Said i owe you) i owe you (i owe you)
When i was down and out (said youve been so good so good to me)
And all my friends was gone
You stayed by my side never left me alone
Ooo i owe you i owe you
(Said youve been so good so good to meeeeee)

When i stop, look back think about my life
You gave me you love weather wrong or right
Ooo i owe you come on i owe you
When i was down and out
And all my friends was gone (i love you so much)
You stayed by my side never left me alone (i love you so much, i love you so much)
Ooo i owe i owe you
