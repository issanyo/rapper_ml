[Intro]
Freakey
Freaky's on the beat
Talk money way, thirty shit
AG Beats
Rich Forever way, hey, hey

[Chorus]
Ayy, runnin' it up with my niggas (true)
I don't get along with no randoms (no)
'Cause I am stuck with my niggas ('cause I am stuck with my niggas)
I could prolly put your mans on (put your mans on)
But I don't fuck with you niggas (but I don't fuck with you niggas)
I'm 'bouta go get me a Phantom (hey)
Just to go stunt on these niggas (skrrt)
I got the scope like the answer
Kick her out the door, no answer (I don't answer)
Diamonds on me throw a tantrum (throw a tantrum)
They just want me 'cause my bands up ('cause my bands up)
Fenny on me hold my pants up (hey)
Louis with the Alexander
Free my niggas that got jammed up (free 'em)
Police askin' about [?] (no)

[Verse]
I just pulled up in that new shit (skrrt)
Read about it in the news clip (read about it)
I'm in her mouth like toothpaste (suckin' dick)
I gotta stack up the blue chips (hey)
I'm smokin' cookie, the blue trip (yeah)
That boy a rookie, I do this (thirty)
The water is on me like cruise ships
We up, but you already knew this (you already knew this)
Can't wife you bitch, I don't know who hit (who hit)
They hatin', but watchin' the movement (but watchin' the movement)
I built my thirties, they ruthless (they ruthless)
I'm sippin' the dirty, I'm snoozin' (I'm sippin')
This shit is way deeper than music
So I'm here to end the confusion (end the confusion)
New money, but never no new shit (never no)
It's still the same me in a new 'fit, hey

[Chorus]
Ayy, runnin' it up with my niggas (hey)
I don't get along with no randoms (true)
'Cause I am stuck with my niggas (no)
I could prolly put your mans on
But I don't fuck with you niggas (but I don't fuck with you niggas)
I'm 'bouta go get me a Phantom
Just to go stunt on these niggas (skrrt)
I got the scope like the answer
Kick her out the door, no answer (I don't answer)
Diamonds on me throw a tantrum (throw a tantrum)
They just want me 'cause my bands up ('cause my bands up)
Fenny on me hold my pants up (hey)
Louis with the Alexander
Free my niggas that got jammed up (free 'em)
Police askin' about [?]
