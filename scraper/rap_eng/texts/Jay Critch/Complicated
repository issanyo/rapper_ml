It don't got to be so complicated
Your bitch we getting faded
100 bands Im tryna get it
Keep it patient and you gonna get it

Fuck about my age Im a motherfucking kid
H- town come around check it how it is
If you ain't about the bizz then we ain't talking shit
Lil snake me know you a bitch

Bad Bitch on the cellular
Got her on the regular
Sideways I get faded on the regular
Real deal real talk I ain't nothing regular
Money on my mind and I planned it on schedule

Silly girl she talk about she wanna her money right
All she down to do is drink and ride that stick tonight
Tryna ride the wave and fuck up on a rockstar
She just like the way Im moving like a nascar
Im moving like a nascar
She hoeing cuz im going far

How you wanna play we just tryna get baked
Focus on yourself you gon get paid
Put it on my life that Ill never dread a Monday
Each day Ima just do it my way

It don't got to be so complicated
Your bitch we getting faded
100 bands Im tryna get it
Keep it patient and you gonna get it
It don't got to be so complicated
Your bitch we getting faded
100 bands Im tryna get it
Keep it patient and you gonna get it

JAY CRITCH

Had to wait for some time I get it
Money on my mind I can't forget it
Money is time I can't wait a minute
Im on my grind I run up the digits
And they hating
Had to call up my moms I made it
Came a long way from posting the payments
Lot of rose Im getting the payments
Daaaaamn
Running off with zips Im telling the truth
And I could have quit but Im nothing like you
Aye
I don't need a bitch I just need me some lube
In the whip gas out the roof
Give her dick pass to the crew
And Im on now
Hoes wanna give me the jaw now
Pull up to the club I bring em all out
I thought Id watch it fall down
Hey
And these niggas acting like bitches
They gossiping like they some hoes
I sip the lean nigga she pop a pill she on the floor

It don't got to be so complicated
Your bitch we getting faded
100 bands Im tryna get it
Keep it patient and you gonna get it
