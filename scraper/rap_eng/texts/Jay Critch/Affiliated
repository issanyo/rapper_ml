Grew up 'round them real niggas (yeah)
Grew up 'round them real niggas, i'm affiliated
Damn, you ain't tryna get no (aye)
You ain't tryna get no money (aye)

[Hook: Jay Critch]
I grew up 'round them real niggas, i'm affiliated (damn)
You ain't tryna get no money, that's humiliating
I need yellow diamonds right now, like it's minute maid
I can't stay broke, it's depressing (let's get it)
I know the hood get real hectic
'Boutta start buzzin' like bees
'Boutta start frontin' the streets
How could I switch up on my fam?
They put they trust into me
Niggas ain't really yo mans
There ain't no love in these streets
And we say fuck the police
I know they wanna put cuffs on my team (yeah)

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
Well connected and well respected, and i'm flexin' but
I need VVS' on my necklace
I need me a presidential rollie like I got elected
Get that money, stack that money like it's tetris
Livin' good even though we strugglin'
Straight out the hood, i'm comin' for rubber bands
And we stack it up 'till it's equal
I see you fake boy, you see through
Police stay shootin' my people
So how the fuck what i'm smokin' illegal?
My foreign chick, she illegal
I had to teach her the lingo
She got that wet, like a cinco
I lay her up like a finger roll
I lay her up, then I leave
I gotta go make a move (go make a move)
Girl I got work to do, I gotta hit up the school
Thought we agreed that you food?
Now you tryna act like a fool
What else was I do?
Get someone clapped in your crew
I need all the lou, trust me I been in the lou (aye)
Mommy say I better stay in school
But science class don't have me driving coupes
So i'm feelin' like fuck the classroom
I already know my math, I know how to count that cash
I already know how to divide the pack
And its cause

And i'm affiliated, with them OGs
Yeah them niggas know me
My hood come in so deep
Posted by that store
Wasn't buyin' groceries
My brother had me on that A-block since like '03 (aye)
I might say what up, but you don't know me
She on me, soon as she approach me
She like Jay Critch can you coach me?
Imma go and put her on the home team (on the home squad)
Put her on the home team
Aye aye, yeah they see him (ok ok)
Shorty think she 'bout to be my BM
I heard it go down in the DM (down in the DM)
But she told her friends, it's going down when I see him
Her man a lame, wouldn't wanna be him
Classic man, AirMax '95s and some Timbs
