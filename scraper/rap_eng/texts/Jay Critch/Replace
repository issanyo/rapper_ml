[Intro]
Turn me up
Hey
Jay Critch, hood fave
Talk Money Gang
Jamz turn me up (Hey)

[Chorus]
I'm in the Wraith, feelin' like I'm outer space, ayy
I blow a bag then you know it get replaced, wait
Diamonds go apeshit, making you cover your face, ayy
Shorty just take dick (Hey), I don't take her on a date
They always frontin', I'm on to something
I just made a play for the green
I need an award or somethin', we all be stuntin'
I'm breaking bread with the team
We got it all from nothing, the hoes is coming
They know the money with me
Check out the stones, that's lot of VV
I'm on the road like I popped a bean

[Verse 1]
My shooters don't pass, they jackin' from deep
You can't get a pass, stop jackin' the team
Spent five on a bag, my jacket cost three
I get me the bags, then I gotta leave, ayy
I don't care what you sayin', I don't know you
Diamonds goin' Super Saiyan like Goku
Young nigga make a lot of bands off of Pro Tools
Niggas juggin' off the flip phone like it's '02
And I gotta keep it real, keep it old school (Keep it real)
Niggas saying that they will, but they won't do
Had to do it for the hills, what I told you? (For the hills)
I was in the chicken spot, now it's Nobu (Hey)
And we going worldwide but y'all local (Local)
Just chill out, you niggas too heavy (Heavy)
Quit cappin', you niggas ain't ready (Ain't ready)
The Jattic is giving me headaches
But my pinky ring look like confetti (Ice)
Fuck a ho, I just want me some cake (Want me some cake)
The strap is close, mama told me be safe (Graow)
I had to go put the racks in the safe (Hey), ayy

[Chorus]
I'm in the Wraith, feelin' like I'm outer space, ayy
I blow a bag then you know it get replaced, wait
Diamonds go apeshit, making you cover your face, ayy
Shorty just take dick (Hey), I don't take her on a date
They always frontin', I'm on to something
I just made a play for the green
I need an award or somethin', we all be stuntin'
I'm breaking bread with the team
We got it all from nothing, the hoes is coming
They know the money with me
Check out the stones, that's lot of VV
I'm on the road like I popped a bean

[Verse 2]
That's a fact, pockets full with the G's
Watch your back, block a hundred degrees
I don't do shit for free, they payin' a fee
I'm flexing hard, gotta watch what I eat
Diamonds shine like they brushing they teeth
Dancin' like tutus, new whip with the moon roof
All of my niggas connected like Bluetooth
Niggas broke, they better go get a Blues Clues
I be first to that money and you lose (You lose)
I be first to that money and you lose (You lose)
The bankroll all hundreds, it's true blues
If she suckin' me right, get her new shoes (Sucking me right)
Tell her hold the tooly 'cause I gotta lay low
Might put the bitch on the payroll
I had rips in my Nudies now I got the bankroll
Might catch a flight to Tobago
Hood fave, I stay talkin' 'bout a check
Pockets correct
I been ballin', keep my foot on they neck
Pussy boy callin' a tech'
She keep callin' but I told her just put it to rest
Shorty, I'm on to the next (Hey)
Good brain like she takin' a guess
Money long range, I be making it stretch
Just get the cheese, what's the hold up? (Hold up)
Make some plays off of that Motorola (Motorola)
Green on me like I'm Yoda (Yoda)
Said she wanna taste, want a sip of this soda (Sip of this soda)
New chain heavy, feel like a boulder (Hey)
The 'Rari sick like this shit got Ebola (Shit got Ebola)
My necklace is stackin' up, it's getting colder (Colder)
Like Tetris I stack it up 'til it's game over (Game over)

[Chorus]
I'm in the Wraith, feelin' like I'm outer space, ayy
I blow a bag then you know it get replaced, wait
Diamonds go apeshit, making you cover your face, ayy
Shorty just take dick (Hey), I don't take her on a date
They always frontin', I'm on to something
I just made a play for the green
I need an award or somethin', we all be stuntin'
I'm breaking bread with the team
We got it all from nothing, the hoes is coming
They know the money with me
Check out the stones, that's lot of VV
I'm on the road like I popped a bean

[Outro]
Ayy, I'm in the Wraith
Wait, diamonds go apeshit, makin' you cover your face
Ayy, I'm in the Wraith, feelin' like I'm outer space
Wait, diamonds go apeshit, makin' you cover your face
