Jay Critch, Hood Fave
Forest beats
(Hey)

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
Ayy, I got me some change and I stayed the same, nigga
I hop in the foreign, I’m switchin' lanes quicker
No, I hop in the foreign
She say I’m her favorite nigga
You niggas just want the fame but my niggas aimin' bigger
Swish, ballin' like James on niggas
You a bitch, that’s why I can’t hang with niggas
No piff, cookie my fragrance, nigga
My wrist, cold like a glacier, nigga
Your bitch, tryna run games on niggas
She suckin' dick, she ain’t gettin' paid though, nigga
I gave her a tip, cut off that lame ass nigga
Hop out the whip, been put that flame on niggas

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
My 30s on go for the payments (30)
Say you in your glow, well it’s fadin' (Hey)
In the Wraith, color Caucasian
Get the cake, don’t do no waitin'
You got a hand out but I had to take it
I know I stand out, diamonds amazin' (Ice, ice)
Man down, fell asleep off the Fanta
I’m the man now, buy my momma a mansion

[Chorus: Jay Critch & Offset]
Aye, I got me some change and I stayed the same, nigga
I hop in the foreign, I’m switchin' lanes quicker
No, I hop in the foreign
She say I’m her favorite nigga
You niggas just want the fame but my niggas aimin' bigger
Swish, ballin' like James on niggas
You a bitch, that’s why I can’t hang with niggas
No piff, cookie my fragrance, nigga
My wrist, cold like a glacier, nigga
Your bitch, tryna run games on niggas
She suckin' dick, she ain’t gettin' paid though, nigga
I gave her a tip, cut off that lame ass nigga
Hop out the whip, been put that flame on niggas (Offset)

Drippin' in Saint Laurent overseas (Drip)
Life's a static, hit off with a Patek (Life)
I fuck that hoe on the floor on the palet (Hey)
Baddies on baddies on baddies (Bad)
They singin' like Gladys, they eat it like cabbage
We pull in, cars they on valet (Valet)
Stars in the ceilin', no planets (Stars)
On top of your bitch like a tally (Smash)
I walk through the mall up at Rally (Boo)
Pull out the kisser, that bih gon' do damage (Bow, bow)

Ice out the gang cause the gang is my family (Gang)
Niggas can't hold, can't fuck with me (Nah)

Choppin' up the dough like a puzzle piece

[Verse 3: Jay Critch]
My niggas workin' the hardest
Buckets, get to the racks like Harden
Duckin', from the police department
Fuck it, we still gon’ get it regardless
And I’m juggin', you can’t ball with us, you garbage
Niggas buggin', copy the wave we started
Straight out the oven, I'm getting paid, they starvin'
I’m in her stomach, she swallow seeds, she farmin'
Hood fave get the extras
Now, fuck a next up
Big Bentley truck fuck a Tesla
Walk around with my chest up, flexed like a wrestler
You niggas fold under pressure
Rich Forever the best up
Get it together, making these niggas play catch up
I hope you got your vest up
You tryna test us, they gon’ be cleanin' your mess up (Hey)
Your bitch was frontin' ‘til she saw me stuntin'
Baby I know you know better
I want the money that’s end of discussion
Don’t call me 'less it’s ‘bout cheddar
I’m in the hood, 4 grams in the 'Wood
It’s me Bundie, Justo and Cheddar
All this ice looking good, try hit a jug
Pussy boy you could never (No)
Your bitch say she love me forever and ever
And I did not know what to tell her
Switched up once I hit it, I know she a bird
This Gucci ain’t touching no feathers (No)
I'ma hop in the coupe and I swerve
I’m keeping my foot on the pedal (Skrt)
I heard she be fucking with nerds, shawty you not on my level

[Chorus]
Ayy, I got me some change and I stayed the same, nigga
I hop in the foreign, I’m switchin' lanes quicker
No, I hop in the foreign
She say I’m her favorite nigga
You niggas just want the fame but my niggas aimin' bigger
Swish, ballin' like James on niggas
You a bitch, that’s why I can’t hang with niggas
No piff, cookie my fragrance, nigga
My wrist, cold like a glacier, nigga
Your bitch, tryna run games on niggas
She suckin' dick, she ain’t gettin' paid though, nigga
I gave her a tip, cut off that lame ass nigga
Hop out the whip, been put that flame on niggas
