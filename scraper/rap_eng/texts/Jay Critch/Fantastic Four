[Verse 3: Rico]

Bitch I'm back, let's get to the bands
Off-white, I was drinking a ten
Got it tatted, I was drinking a gram
While you was at home taking pics for the gram
Whip with me nigga you ain't taking no stand
Go for a year now I'm outta that jam
She suckin' me up but that bitch got a man
She want me to fuck but that's not on my plan
Dumb bitch, my bitch too foreign
Ballin' hard, all my 30s they scoring
Feeling like this when you driving that foreign
Sellers with me, might go 40
Boyfriend a rat with no name
Bitch I'm too fat for Balmains
I do the test with go frames
And these right here they Cartier lenses
Twelve-hundred to clamp the vision
Pit 'em off when I'm counting the digits
Talk Money, niggas shut up and listen

It don't start 'til we get to the party
Start shit then we ending the party
Pour Henny for the block in the lobby

[Hook: Jay Critch]
