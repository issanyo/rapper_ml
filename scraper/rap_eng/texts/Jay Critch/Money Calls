[Verse 1: Ben Frierson]
I am the one, so I keep a gun
These niggas ain't catchin' me slippin, I'm thankfully grippin'
'32 on me, I call it Blake Griffin
Fuck with the gang and you might end up missin'
Drop the phantom got the top missin'
'30 on me got the ice drippin'
Niggas hatin' but my songs they listen
V.I.P with the bottles, strippers, got the bitches kissin'
Back-to-back, in and out the spots, like a sale on christmas
Goin' like a teacher when I talk you listen
Not doing features so don't ask the question
3K for a walkthrough, after 30 minutes, hit them feet steppin
Never misdirectin' with the Smith & Wesson'
Nigga I'm convinced that Imma' die a legend
Pillow-talking that's some suckah shit
Killas know that you should come and get
All my niggas need a bunch of shit
They just love to see the hunnids flip
Diamonds dancin' while I fuck your bitch
Let em hangin', I'll tuck em in' (Gang!)

[Verse 2: Jay Critch]
Imma' pull up in two seater, he got the pounds and we runnin' it
I can not come for no eater, hittin' that bitch then I'm dumpin' it
These niggas lyin' they gunnin' shit, duffle bag with the hunnids in
Fuck the police, fuck the government, private jet smoke a blunt in it
And my niggas gon' get to the payments, money foreign I gotta exchange it
She said that I'm so entertainin', and I'm still with the gang I ain't changing
I get off in the ghost like Waldo, still walk with the pack in my cargo
Gotta keep me a semi, or sawed-off
Where that money be going, I follow
Where that money be coolin', I pick-up
Hood-fave, my pockets do sit-ups
I was down by the young nigga get-up
She suckin' me til she get hiccups
She mixin' this in with the liquor
Now she forget she got a nigga
I been flexin', I get some of that nigga
I'm smokin' a bag we don't switch up
My bitch, she bad and boujee, but she freaky when she get off the henny
I drop a bag in Louie, but today I'm steppin out in the Fendi
I make an action movie, everytime I pull up, 30's be with me
If I don't have the toolie, brodie got it, all my shooters got plenty

[Verse 3: Ben Frierson]
When that money be goin', I follow
I get that shit with my eyes closed
I need the cheese like a nacho
I had to ice out my vatos
Im payin face like Picasso
A nigga move more 'n he die slow
I can't trust him he talkin to 5-0
Roll in the woods, enchilado
Mention that Louie, that Gucci, that Fendi with that new Milano
We need the money like pronto
Callin' that shit that I ride for
Pop a wheelie when we see the 5-0
Got the shooters posted on the block though
Niggas went in on this rap shit, but the game got it on lock though like (Gang!)
