[Intro]
Nick E on the track
Cashing out, bitch
Nick E on the track
Hey, yeah, aye

[Hook]
He said that he talking money
Speak up, nigga, nobody heard ya
She said I'm movin too funny
Racks up, shawty, I gotta curve you
Remember running off a pack
It’s in the hood what you need, Imma serve you
Broke bitch get back, if she ain’t talking chicken then I’m allergic, heyy
Imma pull up and I’m flexin on purpose
Aye, Imma smoke this jat and get honey bourbon
Hey, diamonds on me, shawty, why you so nervous
Shawty, I’m hot like the furnace
Imma go and get the Wraith, swervin

[Verse]
I need a cape, woke up seeing all of my dreams
These niggas turn fake, fuck niggas, ain’t on the team
They should have nothing to say
Niggas ain’t tryna get to the cheese
Told them to get out my way, do the most for the loot, I'mma fiend
Told them to get out my way, do the most for the loot, I'mma fiend
Told them to get out my way, do the most to the loot, I'mma fiend
You could get hit with the K
Shooters running down make a scene
You could get hit with the K
Shooters running down with the beam
She all in my face want the diamonds, she don’t really want me
She calling me bae and I want the pussy, but I really want green
Bruh keep talking this tough shit
But that nigga pussy he don’t really want beef
Really get tied up, it's abduction
Aye, shut em up, throw em back in the v
Broke boy, change the subject
Ain’t talkin’ money, you ain’t talkin’ to me
She sucking seed like the rugrats
Told her pull up, told her get on her knees
Come here let me touch that, shawty bad tryna get in between
These niggas suspect, they too fake, had to roll up the weed
Hatch a Buddha, back right pour 4 in the lean
And I’m too clutch, 3 seconds and they passing to me
I’m like boo yah, I just hit a lick for the P, hey
You a loser, diamonds on me dance Billie Jean
Big body take up 2 lanes
I’mma do the dash like Usain
I don’t give a fuck what you say
Imma get the cash, I’m too paid
Tryna get the cash, you too late
Diamonds they flash, kool-aid
All black Jag dooms day
Poured a Fendi in the bag, who hey

[Hook]
He said that he talking money
Speak up, nigga, nobody heard ya
She said I'm movin too funny
Racks up, shawty, I gotta curve you
Remember running off a pack
It’s in the hood what you need, Imma serve you
Broke bitch get back, if she ain’t talking chicken then I’m allergic, heyy
Imma pull up and I’m flexin on purpose
Aye, Imma smoke this jat and get honey bourbon
Hey, diamonds on me, shawty, why you so nervous
Shawty I’m hot like the furnace
Imma go and get the Wraith, swervin

[Outro]
These niggas turn fake, fuck niggas, ain’t on the team
They should have nothing to say
Niggas ain’t tryna get to the cheese
Told them to get out my way, do the most for the loot, I'mma fiend
Told them to get out my way, do the most for the loot, I'mma fiend
Told them to get out my way, do the most to the loot, I'mma fiend
You could get hit with the K
Shooters running down make a scene
You could get hit with the K
Shooters running down with the beam
She all in my face, want the diamonds, she don’t really want me
