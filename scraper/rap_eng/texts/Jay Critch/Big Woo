[Intro: Jay Critch]
Today I am a god
Hey

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
On the block, we get it in though
Bent up locks, bustin' out windows (grraow)
Sendin' shots, niggas duckin' like limbo (duckin' like limbo)
Sendin' shots, niggas run out they Timbos (run out they Timbos)
I done came up from the ground, 'member I was runnin' off with the pounds (juug)
Hey, look at me now, lotta digits got me losin' my count

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
Niggas talkin', but they broke
Came from nothin', but I'm gettin' it now (gettin' it now)
Niggas frontin', they ain't gettin' no thous (gettin' no thous)
Fight night, ayy shooters got rounds (shooters got rounds)
That money important to me, fuck her once, bitch boring to me (boring to me)
Niggas said they comin' strong, but they weak (strong, but they weak)
Cool out, boy you ain't from no street (ain't from no street)

[Verse 2: Kooda B]
Did all of the trappers [?] in this dump? Got me a package (what else?)
Fuck it, wipe it down, get her a [?], look at the cash, yeah I'm laughin' (hahaha)
This the life that I live, lil' bitch, I'm not braggin'
Free [?] he got eighteen [?]
Run it up, run it up, get it like Jim with the [?], you know that I'm in it I (what else?)
These [?], and I just left Barney's, they [?]
Geek off the Act, countin' these racks, Stelly just got a good batch (bitch)

[Verse 3: Stelly Hundo & Jay Critch]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh
Sellin' G, and the G is for Gus (I get it)
Get a bag, run it up, that's a must
Fuck it up, get it back, that's a must (I get it)
Look at me, look at you, look at us
Yeah, this way
We came with the duff, yeah that way (that way)
Came in through the front, front if you want
Get slumped if you want, yeah that way (that way)
And I just hopped out a foreign car (skrrt)
Straight to the bed, I ain't goin' far
I put the fool in the same car
I told this bitch I'm a coin star
Until we fuck like we porn stars
She wanna know who the gang are
I told her we stay getting Benjis
I put this bitch in a frenzy (hey)

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
On the block, we get it in though
Bent up locks, bustin' out windows (grraow)
Sendin' shots, niggas duckin' like limbo (duckin' like limbo)
Sendin' shots, niggas run out they Timbos (run out they Timbos)
I done came up from the ground, 'member I was runnin' off with the pounds (juug)
Hey, look at me now, lotta digits got me losin' my count

[Verse 4: Jay Crtich]
Ayy, pour up the lean in the Faygo (in the Faygo)
Niggas keep watchin', but it's okay though (hey)
Used to rerock the lean with the [?] (juug)
Choppas beat boxin', drummin' like halo (grraow)
Way too many chains like Django
Say you in a gang, you ain't though (say you in a gang, you ain't though)
Ride around, me, Forty, and Tango (and Tango)
Diamonds dancin', got 'em seein' a rainbow (ice)

[Verse 5: Kooda B]
I spin the block
They call me Kooda B, yo Rambo with the chop (lil' bitch)
Chasin' guap, don't fess me up or you know that you gettin' shot (lil' bitch)
Big [?], when it's goin' stop (lil' bitch)
Catch the drop, six o'clock cash out in a new spot (lil' bitch)

[Verse 6: Stelly Hundo]
Talk money, well money my convo
Stelly, huh yeah, I get straight to them hundos (hundos)
Ride around, I get straight to the C-notes
Did it again, they think I got the cheat code (whoa)
