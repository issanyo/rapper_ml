[Hook]
Lot of these bitches be wildin’
And my money it gotta stay piling
Then I go take a flight to the island
Shawty bite it like a gator
I can serve you like a waiter
Yeah I’m all about that paper
Then I go ball like a pacer
Shawty not bad I go and eraser

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
Smokin’ that gas all different flavors
Hop in the jag then I’m speed racing
Talkin cash I can speak to you later
Diamonds flash like a taser
Diamonds bite like gators
I need the cover of fader
I do not play ‘bout the paper
On point like a laser
Money it stood like a magazine
Momma see me on a magazine
I just been winnin’ they mad at me
Drop the bag that’s a tragedy
These broke hoes all raggedy
I hit some juggs got it all off
‘member I’m liftin’ the doors off
I pullin’ numbers on the score board

[Hook]
Lot of these bitches be wildin’
And my money it gotta stay piling

Shawty bite it like a gator

Yeah I’m all about that paper

Shawty not bad I go and eraser

[Verse 2: Vendetta]
She giving me head
I get my money my bread
Niggas focused on the wrong shit
Need to think ‘bout the money instead
The stuff on my shoulder be red
She pull up she giving me head
Making a move chess
Bullet ‘ill go threw your chest
Fuck her I’m passing on test
Undercovers giving stress
Tryna lock everybody I’ma go jump in a body
All of my niggas they round me
Shawty be giving me brain
It’s TMB on the train
Swervin’ switchin’ a lane
Nervous you cannot hang
Smokin’ out all of the pain
Takin’ my money I’m makin’ it rain
