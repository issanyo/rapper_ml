Woah (free 99)
Aye (free 99)
(I get it free 99)

{Chorus}
I take your weed like it's mine
Say you get it for the low
Well I get it free 99
Then she gon' act like a hoe
That can never be no bitch of mine
I can't take and L that's fasho
And she gave me a piece of the pie

[Hook]
I take your weed like it's mine
Aye, aye

Say you get it for the low
I get it free 99
Woah, aye
(I get it free 99)

[Chorus]
I take your weed like it's mine
Say you get it for the low
Well I get it free 99
Then she gon' act like a hoe
That can never be no bitch of mine
I can't take and L that's fasho
And she gave me a piece of the pie
Cause I got the rackies no lie

[Verse 1]
I will never fade, i'm a heavyweight
Let me demonstrate, I got hella cake
I was down smoking weed trying to levitate
Come through know the bands on me
Said she wanna put the hands on me
She gon' ride til' the tank on E
Girl that ass too fat, you gon' need Plan B mami
Yeah, feeling like I need the greens mami
Need a fan on me
That's your girl she be acting like a fan round me
Hear my sound on the speakers
I'm just rolling like a pound of the reefer
Yeah yeah goin' down once I meet her
I need like a hundred thou for a feature
"You talkin' to much", what I told your bitch
And that bitch is like a nosy bitch
Hit my pager like stojakovic]
If it's bout bankrolls, I gotta go
Niggas all so broke and got no hope
They don't want no smoke, they smell the dough
Bring it straight to your door like Domino's
And they so washed up they hit the cleaners
My niggas got into the party with the heaters
Shoot and walk away Gilbert Arenas
And my bitch from far away got no visa

[Chorus]
I take your weed like it's mine
Say you get it for the low
Well I get it free 99
Then she go again act like a hoe
That can never be no bitch of mine
I can't take and L that's fasho
And she gave me a piece of the pie
Cause I got the rackies no lie
