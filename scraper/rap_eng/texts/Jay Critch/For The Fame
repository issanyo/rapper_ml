[Intro: Rich The Kid and Jay Critch]
Listen
OG Parker
Rich Forever 3 way
The money way, the only way
Ayy, yeah

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Can't make her my boo
She wanna fuck on the crew
I get her wet like a pool
I pull up flexing in Balmains
Come for that bitch you a lame
Ain't shit change
Too many chains
She wanna fuck for the fame
Can't make her my boo
She wanna fuck on the crew
I get her wet like a pool
I pull up flexing in Balmains
Come for that bitch you a lame
Ain't shit change
Too many chains
She wanna fuck for the fame


[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Act' in the Sprite
She a model but she key for the night
Pussy good put the bitch on a flight
It's the Gram she'll fuck for a light (Act' in the Sprite)
More lean I got drank, pint
Swerve the wraith, fell asleep twice
Diamonds on me and they real bite
Naw, dat way
Met your bitch I'ma fuck her the same day
I got a mansion I'm made
Too many chains like a slave
Hunnit bands on a rich, flexing
Big mama, she callin' and textin'
Thick bitch, I just got her from Texas
Young nigga, I'm gettin' money, I'm reckless
Can't make her my boo
She wanna fuck on the crew
Rich Forever get the money, it's blue
Pull up flexin' like ooh
I got the racks on me now
I hit that hoe on the couch
I just might bust in her mouth (I just might bust in her mouth)

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Can't make her my boo
She wanna fuck on the crew
I get her wet like a pool
I pull up flexing in Balmains
Come for that bitch you a lame
Ain't shit change
Too many chains
She wanna fuck for the fame
Can't make her my boo
She wanna fuck on the crew
I get her wet like a pool
I pull up flexing in Balmains
Come for that bitch you a lame
Ain't shit change
Too many chains
She wanna fuck for the fame

[Verse 2: Jay Critch]
Grab the chicken çause I gotta have it
Trappin posted like Dirk on the Mavericks
Cashing now that boy livin' so lavish
Saggin', pockets filled up with that cabbage
I done walked in the spot with a bad bitch
Hide your bitch she wan' fuck the Hood Favorite
Diamond wrist bitches sayin' I made it
Designer shit I came through with the latest
Niggas talk a lot get your money up
She goin´ down  cause I'm comin' up
Rich Forever I walk around with the bands
Niggas plottin' I walk around with the fan
White girl suck me up off a Xan
Hit a lick stuff the knots in my pants
Bad bitch I'ma fly her to France
Remember I was runnin' off with them grams

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Can't make her my boo
She wanna fuck on the crew
I get her wet like a pool
I pull up flexing in Balmains
Come for that bitch you a lame
Ain't shit change
Too many chains
She wanna fuck for the fame
Can't make her my boo
She wanna fuck on the crew
I get her wet like a pool
I pull up flexing in Balmains
Come for that bitch you a lame
Ain't shit change
Too many chains
She wanna fuck for the fame
