[Intro]
Turn me up
Hood Fave!
Sign't it!
Jamz turn me up

[Chorus]
Hoppin' out they recordin' like TiVo
Make a movie then makin' a sequel
All these diamonds is boostin' my ego
Diamonds is dancin' like Ne-Yo
But a nigga so cold, frio
Got them touchin' they toes, freak hoes
It was me and the bros, 3-0
She said I got the dough, we know
Shawty lookin' for someone to save her
She go down she doin' the favors
This loud is wakin' the neighbors
Mama proud I got me some paper
Niggas don't want no smoke, no vapor
They say I'm a play-maker
Touch down in L.A. like the Lakers
I been on my grind like a skater (Hey)

[Verse 1]
Hood Fave, had to go make a move
I finessed the world for them dividends
With this chain, I can't step in the room
It's way too much water I'm swimmin' in
Look at the women I'm swimmin' in
Had to go run up a bag just to shit again
Niggas be bitches, they actin' all feminine
I'm in the Bentley, it used to be minivans
Run up on me, is you kiddin' man?
You don't wanna see my 30s in that minivan
Sippin' lean, I be high to the ceiling fan
Juggin' Ps, I was never the middle man
She a skeeze, should've hit it and quit it man
Balmain jeans, all these racks gotta fit it in
I do me, I ain't worried about fittin' in
In a V, goin' right to the Benjamins
And the way my diamonds hit, real sunny
Running out of time, better get you some money
I don't know who you is, you dummy
I pulled up in a Louis fit, real smutty
I remember back then, she was frontin' on a kid
Now the bitch tryin' to give me cudi
They be hatin' on a kid 'cause I'm gettin' backends
But that's just how it is, shit funny
Hood Fave bitch, but your whole hood love me (Hood Fave)
I just hit the stage, brought the whole hood with me
If I tell them to spray, they all would for me
Oh that's your bae, put dick in her tummy
All my chains make the hoes blink twice
All this ice got 'em actin' polite
Pockets right, I don't need your advice
Pour the sprite, I'll be good for the night

[Chorus]
Hoppin' out they recording like TiVo
Make a movie then makin' a sequel
All these diamonds is boostin' my ego
Diamonds is dancin' like Ne-Yo
But a nigga so cold, frio
Got them touchin' they toes, freak hoes
It was me and the bros, 3-0
She said I got the dough, we know
Shawty lookin' for someone to save her
She go down she doing the favors
This loud is wakin' the neighbors
Mama proud I got me some paper
Nigga's don't want no smoke, no vapor
They say I'm a play-maker
Touch down in L.A. like the Lakers
I been on my grind like a skater (Hey)

[Verse 2]
I'm in the penthouse, but I came from the basement
Dressed in penthouse, cookie my fragrance
Smokin' cookie, shawty say she could taste it
Once I hit it, I'ma need the replacement
Cashin' bags and we duckin' them cases (Hey)
'Lotta cash, gotta ice out the bracelet (Watch)
Try to take it and you gon' need a face lift
30s with me, they ain't leavin' no traces (30)
Only blue hundreds, I'm a racist
How my crew stuntin' it's amazin'
They was doubtin', didn't think I would make it
Now they actin' proud, know they fakin'
They ain't hand it out, had to take it
We came from the ground, from the pavement
Please don't run your mouth, boy don't say shit
Money all around, tell her rake it

[Chorus]
Hoppin' out they recordin' like TiVo
Make a movie then makin' a sequel
All these diamonds is boostin' my ego
Diamonds is dancin' like Ne-Yo
But a nigga so cold, frio
Got them touchin' they toes, freak hoes
It was me and the bros, 3-0
She said I got the dough, we know
Shawty lookin' for someone to save her
She go down she doin' the favors
This loud is wakin' the neighbors
Mama proud I got me some paper
Nigga's don't want no smoke, no vapor
They say I'm a play-maker
Touch down in L.A. like the Lakers
I been on my grind like a skater (hey)
