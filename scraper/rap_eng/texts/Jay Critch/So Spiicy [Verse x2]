[Verse]
Foreign same color as my wife be, Boy I think ya bitch finna like me
Tell her trow it back make the shit a little spicy, Stepped in the club I ain't showing no Id
Since a young nigka I had the juice that's Hiic, Better watch ya back shit ain't always what it might seam
You could move wrong, Get hit with a light thing
We was on the block, in the sun, [?]
Put dick in ya hoe and she facing it, Counting up all the dough in the wraith and shit
We might kick in ya door just to make this shit, Everything gotta go yeah we taking it
And I'm fucking hoes, She can't take this shit
But I'm dubbing the hoe, She a basic bitch
She looking for a relationship, I'm sorry I can not relate to it
I'm never doing no waiting, Scratching another bag of my checklist
Might take a little vacation, I'm thanking god for all of the blessings
I know these nigkas be hating when they all see me they gotta respect it
My nigkas talking all money, They ain't talking money, They leaving a message
All this designer, you can't pronounce what I'm dressed in
They like why you keep flexxin?  is that shit even a question
Gotta smoke out the pound , Dont got no time to be stressing
You dropped the bag on the ground, I hope you learning a lesson
