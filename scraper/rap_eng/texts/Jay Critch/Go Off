[Intro]
Hey!
Yeah, aye, damn
Talk Money Gang, '30 Gang
BK way, nah
Aye Jay Critch Hood Fave(Hey!)

[Hook]
I got the money she never will leave me
I got the water, the water like Fiji
Hard work but I made it look easy
At the concert diamonds shine like a CD
She say i'm wavy, show off
I gotta flex imma show off
She tryin have my baby, hold on
Mix the Balmain with the Goyard
I like her more with her clothes off
Sippin' the Act, doze off
You can get wacked, pole on
Hop in the back, roll off
I'm all for the [?] that I told y'all
Boy you ain't never scrapped you so soft
Tango keep a strap to hold y'all
Melo got the Mac, he go off

[Verse 1]
I told her relax, cut the hoe off
I walk in the Saks buy the whole store
She throw it back, can't take no more
She don't know how to act, imma show her
Move right where I'm from it get real
Act right, shit got me on tilt
Pop a nigga like I'm cracking a seal
My niggas popping and cracking for real
These bitches watching my pockets, chill
Talking bout hoes I got options, kill
You be with it trying to cop a feel
These niggas talking they Dr. Phil

[Hook]
I got the money she never will leave me
I got the water, the water like Fiji
Hard work but I make it look easy
At the concert diamonds shine like a CD
She say i'm wavy, show off
I gotta flex imma show off
She tryin have my baby, hold on
Mix the Balmain with the Goyard
I like her more with her clothes off
Sippin' the Act, doze off
You can get wacked, pole on
Hop in the back, roll off
I'm all for the [?] that I told y'all
Boy you ain't never scrapped you so soft
Tango keep a strap to hold y'all
Melo got the Mac, he go off

[Verse 2]
I ran up a sack, I told y'all
Aye, Bentley coupe pulling up with a model
Living like a nigga hitting the lotto
Mixing LA cookie with the gelato
Fresh brick, sippin' straight out the bottle
Get rich nigga you know the motto
Rich hoe and she suck and she swallow
When you start getting money they follow
Hitting juggs, niggas ducking the five-o
Strap on a Ducati full throttle
She ride a dick, little thottie full throttle
Birds singing like Demi Lovato
Big strap, the semi the auto
Click clack, you was talking them problems
Get back, you ain't made for that drama
Split that, put you in a sauna
Ya dig that, streets hot like a sauna
Big facts, I ran off with them commas
I think that I need a Rari no Honda
You gon sink fast playing around in that water

[Hook]
I got the money she never will leave me
I got the water, the water like Fiji
Hard work but I make it look easy
At the concert diamonds shine like a sea
She say i'm wavy, show off
I gotta flex imma show off
She tryin have my baby, hold on
Mix the Balmain with the Goyard
I like her more with her clothes off
Sippin' the Act, doze off
You can get wacked, Polo on
Hop in the back, roll off
I'm all for the [?] that I told y'all
Boy you ain't never scrapped you so soft
Tango keep a strap to hold y'all
Melo got the Mac, he go off
