[Intro]
Yeah
Aye
Now I'm counting bank rolls
I just hit a stain now I'm counting bank rolls
I been finessing, I bet everybody knows
Boy I wouldn't want to be ya
You a stain boy i wouldn't want to be ya (x2)

[Chorus]
I need the cheese, I cannot dream cause that mean you sleep yeah
Boy what you mean it ain't bout the green then I cannot speak yeah
I pour the lean then I roll the weed then I pop a bean yeah
I just want fuck her but I cannot love her cause she is a skeez yeah
I cannot love her i just wanna fuck her cause she got the cheese yeah
Take her to the mall, show her how to ball and run up her Visa
I hit a jugg imma bust out the bands for the summer
What you need I'll serve you like a butler

[Verse]
My bitch a boss, I'm thinking I should buy her Chanel runners
I took a loss but it's all good my niggas all gunners
I'm straight out the hood
I came out the hood, gets hot in the summer
I just hit a jugg, I just hit a jugg now I'm on the come up
What you need, I'll serve you like a butler
Cut the bull shit I ball like Jimmy Butler
Scoop your girl now she suckin' under covers
Fuck 12 I be duckin' undercover
Hit a jugg for the roll
Smoke weed by the O
Pour lean by the fo'
What you need, what you want
I won't splurge on a hoe, she get curved like a bowl
Hit the curve with a scope, let it go and reload
Pay day in a Rove
Day day fucking up the stove
Justo drinkin' O's, Bundy contin' rolls
I need some commas today that money come quicker than fast food
They always got something to say, broke boy who asked you
I get it in anyway, on that money like a tattoo
Imma hop in the foreign right past you
Why you on me? cause that's what the racks do

[Chorus]
I need the cheese, I cannot dream cause that mean you sleep yeah
Boy what you mean it ain't bout the green then I cannot speak yeah
I pour the lean then I roll the weed then I pop a bean yeah
I just want fuck her but I cannot love her cause she is a skeez yeah
I cannot love her i just wanna fuck her cause she got the cheese yeah
Take her to the mall, show her how to ball and run up her Visa
I hit a jugg imma bust out the bands for the summer
What you need I'll serve you like a butler
