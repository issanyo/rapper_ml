[Intro: Jay Critch]
Yah
Aye, hey, yah
Woah, woah
Damn, damn

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
Show you how I does this
Hit a stain for the work then I move it
Every time I gotta pop out, it's some new shit
Came up on some bands, spent that on my new bitch
Better pay me in advance 'fore I lose it
Load two clips, now I don't give two shits
All my niggas ruthless, nigga I could move a 8 ball like a pool stick, yeah
Show you how I does this
Hit a stain for the work then I move it
Every time I gotta pop out, it's some new shit
Came up on some bands, spent that on my new bitch
Better pay me in advance 'fore I lose it
Load two clips, now I don't give two shits
All my niggas ruthless, nigga I could move a 8 ball like a pool stick

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
See me ball now, she ain't used to it
I got big racks, my pockets got [?]
The way I beat it up, she gonna have some bruises
Shawty tapped out, had to go get me a new bitch
Nigga I could move a 8 ball like a pool stick
Nigga got a microwave but I never use it
'Cause I'm heatin' up, show you how I does this
I get in the booth, and I get up on that [?] shit
Balmain upgraded from the True shit
You a broke nigga, I don't give two shits
And my big bro pull up in a new whip
That's a Maserati not a fuckin' Ford Fusion
Take your pack, I'm sorry you had to lose it
Make it flip, now I'm countin' up blue chips
Go blood, but Ike on that blue shit
I'm countin' dough up, pull up on you with two clips
Baby I ball like NBA Live
Baby I'm ballin' like number five
That's not Jason Kidd that's my nigga [?]
If you fuck with my niggas, you die
Big old .30 send you to the sky
Movin' birdies, we let them shits fly
Still a .30, you know how I ride
It's KD, hit a juug for the guap

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
Show you how I does this
Hit a stain for the work then I move it
Every time I gotta pop out, it's some new shit
Came up on some bands, spent that on my new bitch
Better pay me in advance 'fore I lose it
Load two clips, now I don't give two shits
All my niggas ruthless, nigga I could move a 8 ball like a pool stick, yeah
Show you how I does this
Hit a stain for the work then I move it
Every time I gotta pop out, it's some new shit
Came up on some bands, spent that on my new bitch
Better pay me in advance 'fore I lose it
Load two clips, now I don't give two shits
All my niggas ruthless, nigga I could move a 8 ball like a pool stick

[Verse 2: TME]
Thirteen in the park tryna hoop (Kobe)
By fourteen I was all in the loop
Fifteen I was cuttin' out school
Sixteen top dog, runnin' down, tryna scoop
Seventeen big dreams, man I wanted the coupe
Clock in when I hop in the booth
The bottoms red when I hop in them Loubs
Goyard bag, I could hop in that too
But I'm 'bout my green like some vegetable food
Spinach and broccoli, don't forget the celery too
Need that chicken, so I'm tryna get to the stew
Get in the stu, record the shit, I'm speakin' to you
Don't fuck with these dudes, niggas think they real but they fu
He finna [?] the crew all for the Loub
Nigga stuck a gun up his shoe
Son on the news, mama cryin', really he do
Slangin' and bangin', in the streets [?]
All in the mix, showin' out, actin' a fool
Endin' that nigga, did it for some likes and some views
Now he get viewed like every other weekend or two
Niggas is hoes, niggas say they friends but they foes
The jealousy shows, smilin' in my face, call me bro
The haters exposed, just a bunch of average Joes
Ain't chasin' money, busy chasin' average hoes
Ain't chasin' no hoes, me and [?] chasin' the dough
Fast [?] my .30s chase your ass for the dough
So many [?] now he [?]
[?] ball hog, no [?]

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
Show you how I does this
Hit a stain for the work then I move it
Every time I gotta pop out, it's some new shit
Came up on some bands, spent that on my new bitch
Better pay me in advance 'fore I lose it
Load two clips, now I don't give two shits
All my niggas ruthless, nigga I could move a 8 ball like a pool stick, yeah
Show you how I does this
Hit a stain for the work then I move it
Every time I gotta pop out, it's some new shit
Came up on some bands, spent that on my new bitch
Better pay me in advance 'fore I lose it
Load two clips, now I don't give two shits
All my niggas ruthless, nigga I could move a 8 ball like a pool stick
