I got me some change
And I stayed the same nigga
I hop in the foreign
I’m switching lanes quicker
No
I hop in the foreign
She say, “I’m her favorite nigga”
You niggas just want the fame
But my niggas aiming bigger
Swish
Balling like James on niggas
You a bitch
That’s why I can’t hang with niggas
No piff
Cookie my fragrance nigga
My wrist?
Cold like a glacier nigga
Your bitch?
Tryna run games on niggas
She sucking dick
She ain’t getting paid though nigga
I gave her a tip
Cut off that lame ass nigga
Hop out the whip
Been put that flame on niggas

[Verse 1]
My 30s on go for the payments
Say you in your glow well it’s fading
In the Wraith
Color caucasian
Get the cake
Don’t do no waiting
You got a hand out
But I had to take it
I know I stand out
Diamonds amazing
Man down
Fell asleep off the Fanta
I’m the man now
Buy my momma a mansion

[Verse 2]
My niggas working the hardest
Buckets
Get to the racks like Harden
Ducking, from the police department
Fuck It
We still gon’ get it regardless
And I’m chucking
You can’t ball with us
You garbage
Niggas bugging
Copy the wave we started
Straight out the oven
I’m getting paid
They starving
I’m in her stomach
She swallow seeds
She farming
Hood fav get the extras
Now, fuck a next up
Big Bentley truck
Fuck a Tesla
Walk around with my chest up
Flexed like a wrestler
You niggas fold under pressure
Rich Forever the best up
Get it together
Making these niggas play catch up
I hope you got your vest up
You tryna test us
They gon’ be cleaning your mess up
Your bitch was fronting
‘Til she seen me stunting
Baby I know you know better
I want the money
That’s end of discussion
Don’t call me unless it’s ‘bout cheddar
I’m in the hood
4 grams in the wood
It’s me Bundie, Justo and Cheddar
All this ice looking good
Try hit a jug
Pussy boy you could never
Your bitch say she love me forever and ever, And I did not know what to tell her
Switched up once I hit it
I know she a bird
This Gucci ain’t touching no feather
Ima hop in the coupe
And I swerve
I’m keeping my foot on the peddle
I heard she be fucking with nerds
Shawty you are not on my level
