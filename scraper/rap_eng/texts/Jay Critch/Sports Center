[Intro]
Momma said gotta do something with my life
Momma said got to do something like it's wifi
Momma said gotta do something with my life

[Hook: Jay Critch]
Well connected like a wi-fi
Momma said gotta do something with my life
I know would get that bag when the time's right
Lotta diamonds on me flash like they highlights
Sports Center top 10 they some highlights
I told shorty bring her friends over my side
Baby watching from the bench from the blind side
Water way up to my neck like it's high tide

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
Jump in the coupe, to the payment
Straight to the roof from the basement
I want that loot so I take it
She on a cue and she naked
She gon' ride on it with no hands
Said she tired of that minute man
I be high to the ceiling fan
You know I never give a damn
Took her heart and threw it in a can
Would you ride if I'm in a jam
Do a lot, can't stick to the plan
We gon' slide, roll a window and blam
Touchdown, hands on like Cam
Cross-over I'm switching, hands
Bossed up, I got right with the fam
Like a toss up, money land in my hand
Im with mills, we were whipping a Lamb'
Dollar bills all that I understand
Keep it real, why would I lie  to ya mans
From the hills, all we wanted was bands
I keep scoring, street ball like Lance
I give my momma that cheese in advance
Stack it up till that shit in France
Pack it up you ain't gotta no chance

[Hook: Jay Critch]
Well connected like it's wi-fi
Momma said gotta do something with my life
I knew I would get the bag when the time's right
Lotta diamonds on me flash like they highlights
Sports Center top 10 need some highlights
I told shorty bring her friends over my side
Baby watching from the bench from the blind side
Water way up to my neck like it's high tide
