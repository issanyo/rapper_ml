[Intro]
Hood Fave
Hey

[Chorus]
Ayy, all I know is that I gotta have it
Smokin' dope but I call it the Jattic
I’ve been stacking, I made it a habit
Ayy, boy what happened? I thought you were savage
So obvious when they be acting
Got a lot of it, I get the racks in
I'ma treat her like my side bitch
'Cause she fronted on me back then
Could’ve put you in the diamonds
You rather be with the plastic
And I ain't trusting nobody
Unless I see you in some action (Hey)
Keep my brothers right behind me
You other niggas get to packing
I was broke nigga, I was embarrassed
Now my pockets filled up with the cabbage
Now this money everlasting
I used to put it in the mattress

[Verse]
Ayy, but I'm okay if you asking
I went and got me a bad bitch
She came with a little baggage, yeah
But it's okay 'cause I'm cashing
If I see it, I want it, I'm splashing
But it ain't for her, she can’t have shit
Need a new whip, do the dash in it
I’ve been on a road for the backends
And I'm moving slow, never lacking
Diamonds dancing, I got Jackson
I was jugging O’s and I taxed it
Got a yellow bone, she a taxi
Her friend wanna bone, now she 'ight
Bro these bitches hoes, if you ask me
You wasn't with me on the block
Ain't help me stack, you didn’t help me grow
When you see me at the top, stay where you at, leave me alone
I'm in the mall straight flexing, I'ma need all of the extras
Put the hood on my back, no pressure (Hey)
Tryna get the Maybach, no Tesla (Skrrt skrrt)
That money, it look like it stuck to me
I came up, now they don't wanna fuck with me
My niggas know that they stuck with me
Wasn't there, then you can't get the bucks with me
I'm with the same gang, ain't shit changed
Niggas that was in dubs with me
I hit a stain, now I got to maintain
They was runnin' it up with me
And if I run down on your main thing
Then she leaving the club with me
She know I'm up now, how the chain bling
Got her falling in love with me
I'ma go cash out on a new crib, now I'm living in luxury
The Lambo is yellow like Bumblebee
Pockets super sized, double D's (Hey)

[Chorus]
Ayy, all I know is that I gotta have it
Smokin' dope but I call it the Jattic
I've been stacking, I made it a habit
Ayy, boy what happened? I thought you were savage
So obvious when they be acting
Got a lot of it, I get the racks in
I'ma treat her like my side bitch
'Cause she fronted on me back then
Could've put you in the diamonds
You rather be with the plastic
And I ain't trusting nobody
Unless I see you in some action (Hey)
Keep my brothers right behind me
You other niggas get to packing
I was broke nigga, I was embarrassed
Now my pockets filled up with the cabbage
Now this money everlasting
I used to put it in the mattress
