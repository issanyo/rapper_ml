[Intro]
Hey
Talk money gang
730 gang
Hey, hey

[Hook]
Aye
Get bucks
Nigga, you know the play
Lotta bands
Had a hell of a day
Lot of bands
Stuff ‘em right in the safe
We up nigga
So what can they say?
Fuck nigga trynna copy the wave
Bucks, nigga
Runnin right to the bank
Duck nigga
Bro came up with the cake
Had to get up, make a move
Stick to the plan
See niggas everyday
Head full of grams
Roll up and levitate
She got a man
Suck me up anyways
Ice on me
She say I’m good-lookin
Ran off with the pack, good lookin
Ran off with the pack, we took it
I’m in LA smokin the cookies

[Verse: 1]
Had a good day
Pockets look better
It’s the hood fave
Walkin with extras
Ballin hard
Niggas breakin the rim
Boy you fallin off
Gotta hold it together
Niggas hatin
I ain’t feelin that energy
Niggas hatin
And I know that they envy me
I’m a patient
Codeine a remedy
Pocket rocket on the side of mini-me
Hold on let me smoke the J
I been gettin bankrolls, it’s tragic
Make the bankrolls flip, it’s magic
I need M’s
Got Margiela the fabric
Red bottoms
But I ain’t into the fashion
She a freaky lil bitch
She suckin with passion
3M how the diamonds be flashin

[Hook]
Aye
Get bucks
Nigga, you know the play
