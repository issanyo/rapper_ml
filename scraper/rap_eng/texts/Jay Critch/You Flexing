[Chorus: Famous Dex & Rich The Kid]
You ain't in that Maybach, boy you flexin'
The way my diamonds fight, you think they Tekken
I'm Rich Forever, man it is a blessing
Don't try to snatch my chain, I up my weapon
Fuckin' hoes, takin' no names
Play a bitch just like a game
Must be geeking off the cocaine
Think we do it for the fame
You ain't in that Maybach, boy you flexin'
I'm Rich Forever, man that is a blessing

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
My bitch on bad behavior
We got more bread than a baker
Bitch I'm a ball player
We got the long paper
You ain't in that Maybach, boy you flexing
Dexter he dropped fifty on a necklace
Drop a four, not a two, in the big blue
Switch it up, drop a check on a new coupe
Leave you dirty, I whip a birdy
I wake up to money, I count it early
Look at my wrist, a McFlurry
Made our own wave with them benjamins
Niggas they was hatin', we was cashin' in
Bang, we did it first
Now it's a hundred a verse
Put the beat in a hearse
She want some dick and a purse

[Chorus: Famous Dex & Rich The Kid]
You ain't in that Maybach, boy you flexin'
The way my diamonds fight, you think they Tekken
I'm Rich Forever, man it is a blessing
Don't try to snatch my chain, I up my weapon
Fuckin' hoes, takin' no names
Play a bitch just like a game
Must be geeking off the cocaine
Think we do it for the fame
You ain't in that Maybach, boy you flexin'
I'm Rich Forever, man that is a blessing

[Verse 2: Jay Critch]
Say your money way back, stop the flexing
I pull up in that Maybach, peep my necklace
Kung fu, diamonds fighting like it's Tekken
Pockets going dumb too, lot of money in my section
Boy you made a dumb move, got the bad bitch, you ain't stretch it
You let niggas run you, next time better have your weapon
Pockets looking right, I'm rich forever
Flood my neck with ice, I change the light, I change the weather
Niggas broke, tell them boys to go get it together
I got Fendi clothes, I remember polo on the sweater
On the low she keep thinking we together
Hit your ho, now a nigga mad as ever

[Chorus: Famous Dex & Rich The Kid]
You ain't in that Maybach, boy you flexin'
The way my diamonds fight, you think they Tekken
I'm Rich Forever, man it is a blessing
Don't try to snatch my chain, I up my weapon
Fuckin' hoes, takin' no names
Play a bitch just like a game
Must be geeking off the cocaine
Think we do it for the fame
You ain't in that Maybach, boy you flexin'
I'm Rich Forever, man that is a blessing
