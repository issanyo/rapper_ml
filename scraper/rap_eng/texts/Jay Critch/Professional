[Intro: C Choppa and Jay Critch]
Hey
Choppa, blaow
Tote money
(?) gang
Zodiac
Sauce (uh), drip (drip), wock, sip (sip)
Maybe we start revolution
Come get with the movement
You slackin' you losin' like "What is you doin'?"
What is you doin'?
Yo Critch what the fuck we doin', bro, we turn this shit up (hey)

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
Big bro pockets full with the knots
Shoot when I stay in the spot
Made me a play a guap
My niggas stayin' on top
And I ball like I'm (?)
I flex, my name is The Rock
Pour the lean on the rocks (lean lean lean)
(?) (jug)
She do it like a professional (oh!)
She eat me up like an edible
Used to hit the scale with the decimals
Now the figures comin' with the decimals
(?) to the bag, it's incredible
Young nigga do what you never do
Stackin' it up 'til it's 7'2"
I'm gettin' higher than Heaven do

[Verse 1: C Choppa]
I motivate, innovate, concentrate, coordinate, correlate
When you gon' celebrate?
Smoke on the pack, then I levitate, meditate, elevate
Open up Heaven gates
I got two phones like I'm Kevin Gates
Swerve on the interstate, yeah I be in the place
Eat on the beat, that's my dinner plate
Just poured the wock in the Minute Maid
I just been thinkin' 'bout gettin' paid, yah
Drop top, top off, lock up
Rock out, pop now, wyl out
Talkin' the money while you movin' funny
The racks they run zoomy, these p(?)s run from me
We jump in these p(?)s like we got a bungee
The diamonds come out and they lookin' so sunny
Like I be changin' the weather
Rich Forever trend-setters
Two-seater, that's a Bentley Coupe (oh)
Two many fakes, don't know what to do
Good the uzi's packable
I heard your new track, boy, it's laughable
Like I'm Shifu, I do kung fu (chaow)
Got potential, boy, 'cause I'm a young youth
Orange VLONE, that's a jumpsuit
I make smart moves, in (?)

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
Big bro pockets full with the knots
Shoot when I stay in the spot
Made me a play a guap
My niggas stayin' on top
And I ball like I'm (?)
I flex, my name is The Rock
Pour the lean on the rocks
(?)
She do it like a professional
She eat me up like an edible
Used to hit the scale with the decimals
Now the figures comin' with the decimals
(?) to the bag, it's incredible
Young nigga do what you never do
Stackin' it up 'til it's 7'2"
I'm gettin' higher than Heaven do

[Verse 2: C Choppa]
Play these bitches, PlayStation
Yeah my GameBoy, that's a nation (???)
Money multiply an equation
Goin' mach 10, speed racin' (yew)
I gotta yoppa on me
Bling, blaow
Take of his knee
I'm just gon' dunk on the beat
What, what
Off the leash (uh)
Draped up, Raf Simmons
All my pieces they be hittin'
I came in the game for the winnin'
The diamonds start glistenin' and now I'm just killin' (yuh)
I bang on my (?), yeah that's (?)
The diamonds come out lookin' crazy
Why I've been working so hard as of lately
B(?)in' up Benz, yeah, that's just Mercedes (yuuhm)
Baby bottles, from the trap to a nursery
Poppin' these percys, and I flex like Hercules
They ain' 'n, but they want murder me, wait wha
And my pieces punchin' punchin' like Kung Lao
Pull up on them they gon' run South
Got the chicken like it's Kung Pao
They was talkin' hot, but (?)

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
Big bro pockets full with the knots
Shoot when I stay in the spot
Made me a play a guap
My niggas stayin' on top
And I ball like I'm (?)

Stackin' it up 'til it's 7'2"
I'm gettin' higher than Heaven do
