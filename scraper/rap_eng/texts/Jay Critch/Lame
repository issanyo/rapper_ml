[Hook: Famous Dex & (Jay Critch)]
Remember them days being broke, I get the money everybody can see it
Everybody wanna be me, my diamonds clear like a TV
(Niggas talkin' but they broke, all in the comments can't see 'em like Stevie
I Just went and got some dope, pockets disgusting, my pockets look cheesy)
And they know we Rich Forever, ballin' so hard get the money together
Ballin' hard [?], these niggas acting like feathers
(These niggas acting like bitches, smoke out the Backs, not the Swishers
Got them racks now she say I act different, Imma hit from the back then I ditch it)

[Verse: Famous Dex & (Jay Critch)]
Remember the days in the days in the trenches?, trappin' so hard used to trap in the kitchen
I rob the plug now he missin', I get the pounds for the digits
({?} he be whippin' that boy say he getting paid but he isn't
Pussy boy stay in yo lane, remember them nights I was setting up stains?)
And we know you so goofy you lame, I'm poppin' these pills, I can't feel my brain
Niggas switchin' for the fame, 25 thousand my chain
(Hop out the Mazi no Range, my niggas go crazy, my niggas insane
I buy them that Beamer like fuck is you sayin'?, KD from the way I ball like D Wade)
