[Intro]
Bitch I'm a hustler, that's in my genes (Hey)

[Chorus]
Soon as the rackies come in, I be countin' it up, ayy
Every day thanking God that a nigga got on with the team, yeah
I'ma go to the bank, take out something to fill up my jeans
Bitch I'm a hustler, that's in my genes, yeah
I'm talking money so what do you mean?
I hear all the hate, but I don't be givin' a damn, too high off the lean
Say you got the bands, say you got the green, nigga, in your dreams
That bitch wanna fuck me now, I'm kicking her out, kickin' Celene
Jump in the 'Rari and I'm out, the engine so loud, it's leavin' a steam

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I'ma leave it in her mouth, babysitter, she be swallowin' seed
Get the money in and out, like I'm flippin' burgers, I want extra cheese
You gotta get this on cam, diamonds flashin' like I told 'em say cheese
We still run up in your house, if you got it, then I need all the P's
Rocks on my neck like boulders
Stop with the flex, you bogus
Drop like a three in my soda
I'm ballin', shootin' threes from the corner
I remember used to be on the corner
Give me brain 'til I be in a coma
Give me brain like degrees, I don't wanna
Pinky ring four degrees and it's froze up
All this money I can't trust, came from the dust
Get the bag, that's a must
No more Aces so we fuckin' up Lust
You ain't talking cash, just keep it on hush
I'm in that big body, I was just on the bus
Your bitch probably wanna hop in with us
Y'all ain't eatin', niggas havin' your lunch
She be eatin' like my name Cap'n Crunch
Diamonds weavin' and they packin' a punch
My life an action movie, I be havin' to stunt
My shoes bloody like I'm stabbin' it up
Carats on me like a rabbit and stuff
If I pull up on her with all this designer, then I bet she fallin' in love
I woke up and got a whole lot of commas, I think I might go spend a dub

[Chorus]
Soon as the rackies come in, I be countin' it up, ayy
Every day thanking God that a nigga got on with the team, yeah
I'ma go to the bank, take out something to fill up my jeans
Bitch I'm a hustler, that's in my genes, yeah
I'm talking money so what do you mean?
I hear all the hate, but I don't be givin' a damn, too high off the lean
Say you got the bands, say you got the green, nigga, in your dreams
That bitch wanna fuck me now, I'm kicking her out, kickin' Celene
Jump in the 'Rari and I'm out, the engine so loud, it's leavin' a steam

[Verse 2]
You ain't never trapped, pushed no weight
Diamonds on my chain hold more weight
Movin' with the strap, it's on aim
Prada with the straps like it's '08
I just want the brain, she a throwaway
Blunt full of gas, it's propane
Sip on the lean, feel no pain
I won't switch on the gang, it's no way
Gotta get it,  how could you do nothing?
Got a headache, the Jattic is bustin'
And they won't come around 'til you buzzin'
When the cameras come on, they start frontin'
Shorty doing tricks, she stuntin'
But she always makin' a scene
I'ma cut it off, makin' her leave
I been working, I done made me some green
I gotta flex like I'm working out
If you talking money, we'll work it out
Don't need no wallet, it's big amounts
'Member my pockets was in a drought
She told me she want it in her mouth
These niggas burgers like In-N-Out
We was hitting stains like, "You in or out?"
If I make it rain, she could get a house
They can feel the pain
I hop in the booth just to get it out
I get it all off the muscle
You better learn how to hustle
NIggas gon' waste your time
Tryna take your shine, so why would I trust you?
Livin' too fast, I'm getting the bag, and making it double

[Chorus]
Soon as the rackies come in, I be countin' it up, ayy
Every day thanking God that a nigga got on with the team, yeah
I'ma go to the bank, take out something to fill up my jeans
Bitch I'm a hustler, that's in my genes, yeah
I'm talking money so what do you mean?
I hear all the hate, but I don't be givin' a damn, too high off the lean
Say you got the bands, say you got the green, nigga, in your dreams
That bitch wanna fuck me now, I'm kicking her out, kickin' Celene
Jump in the 'Rari and I'm out, the engine so loud, it's leavin' a steam
