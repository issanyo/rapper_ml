[Intro]
Bro what's good bro?
Talk money gang
Nigga’s don't want no- (Hey)
Niggas want no money
They want somebody to go get it for them

[Chorus]
These niggas don't want no money
They want somebody to go get it for them (Go get it for them)
Ay, get you some money, they start acting
Like you gotta reward them
Diamonds on me like awards (Like awards)
She said she tired of that nigga, she bored
Stop talking her bag is way bigger than yours (Than yours)
Stacking ’til my crib look like a resort (Resort)
Bad bitch, she straight from the West Coast (From the West Coast)
I'm giving bars like it's Death Row
She do it all for a check though
I signed it up now my neck glow
I swear that I just wanna ball with my niggas
I don't wanna tote being broke with you niggas
Remember my pockets was smaller, they bigger
I ate me a steak and ran off with the figures

[Verse]
She wanna come get involved with the nigga
Hold up the money keep calling a nigga
'Til I know we go in the back with no swishers
She wildin', I think I might have to dismiss her
Another day another bag to go pick up
She keep coming around me asking for liquor
Keep my brothers with me, they never switch up
Do it both, do the Bentley then switch up
Diamond with me, you gone have to get picked up
When the Maybach, then I want me a Fisker
Diamonds flashing and you not in the picture
I might smash it then I'm hitting her sister
Stupid, I can turn your bitch into a model
Hood fav, bitch I'm doing numbers like the lotto
From the top seats, no space at the bottom
Boss up, if it ain’t Kate what’s the problem (Hey)

[Chorus]
These niggas don't want no money (Don’t want no money)
They want somebody to go get it for them aye
Ay, get you some money, they start acting
Like you gotta reward them
Diamonds on me like awards
She said she tired of that nigga, she bored (She bored)
Stop talking her bag is way bigger than yours (Bigger than yours)
Stacking 'til my crib look like a resort (Hey)
Bad bitch, she straight from the West Coast (From the West Coast)
I'm giving bars like it's Death Row (Death Row)
She do it all for a check though
I signed it up now my neck glow
I swear that I just wanna ball with my niggas
I don’t wanna tote being broke with you niggas
Remember my pockets was smaller, they bigger
I ate me a steak and ran with the figures
