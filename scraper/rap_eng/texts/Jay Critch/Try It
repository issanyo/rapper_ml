[Intro: Jay Critch]
Hey
La m√∫sica de Harry Fraud

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
The talking never gets to me
I came from the jungle where the lions and gorillas be
We ain't showin' sympathy
How you say you get to the money remains a mystery (Hey)
Talkin' 'bout it but can't show it, nigga you lyin' then
Hood fave, my shit jumpin' up out the frying pan
You say you gon' do it, why you ain't try it then?
You say you gon' do it, why you ain't try it then?

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
Broke niggas can't sit with me
I've been on the road, three phones, she can't get to me
She won't ever mean shit to me
'Cause I could get a clone and my clothes came from Italy
Ayy, she want me to bone 'cause it's slippery
She leave on her thong, in the zone when she look at me
Smoking out the O's but I started from a nick a week
Juggin' for too long, who you foolin' with the trickery?
I show out when I show up
I was younger, I said I'd be like me when I grow up
I just crashed, tryna see how long that I could do the donuts
She get splashed by the necklace 'cause the water on me froze up

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
The talking never gets to me
I came from the jungle where the lions and gorillas be
We ain't showin' sympathy
How you say you get to the money remains a mystery (Hey)
Talkin' 'bout it but can't show it, nigga you lyin' then
Hood fave, my shit jumpin' up out the frying pan
You say you gon' do it, why you ain't try it then?
You say you gon' do it, why you ain't try it then?

[Verse 2: French Montana]
From the block to the top, straight victory
Puff and Big, add another chapter to the history
Clic's want it slippery, real from the glittery
Cash, fuck the bills, Hillary
Literally a don, dripped in Armani
Somalian pirate, ball like Kyrie, straight ball
Bitches callin', I'm all in
I made a fraction off that heroin, Eric Clapton
My dogs assassins
Talking snow, grab your ski slopes in the Aspen
Sippin' honey and wine
My bitch in Dolce Gabban'
From the bottom we climb
In the green, never Moulin Rouge
In the coupe gettin' sloppy booch

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
The talking never gets to me
I came from the jungle where the lions and gorillas be
We ain't showin' sympathy
How you say you get to the money remains a mystery (Hey)
Talkin' 'bout it but can't show it, nigga you lyin' then
Hood fave, my shit jumpin' up out the frying pan
You say you gon' do it, why you ain't try it then?
You say you gon' do it, why you ain't try it then?

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Let's go
Trolling never get to me, I'm holding so it's lit for me
Rollie is a gift for me, the Rolls is like a Lyft for me
What you assholes is putting out don't do shit for me
Pennywise rapper, you clowns ain't doing it for me
I'm still waiting for them to try it though
It's Talk Money, why you niggas getting quiet though?
They say love don't cost a thing, I don't buy it though
My bitch thick, always say she on a diet though
Salads and sushi, carrots and Gucci
I collab with real niggas, not balanced with goofies
I let 'em talk while I get my blue benji on
My skin thicker than Nicki in a Fendi thong, so

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
The talking never gets to me
I came from the jungle where the lions and gorillas be
We ain't showin' sympathy
How you say you get to the money remains a mystery (Hey)
Talkin' 'bout it but can't show it, nigga you lyin' then
Hood fave, my shit jumpin' up out the frying pan
You say you gon' do it, why you ain't try it then?
You say you gon' do it, why you ain't try it then?
