[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
We pullin' up with no invitation
I finally made it, it's no debatin'
Might walk with a hundred for motivation
My bitches they fuck off a conversation
Told y'all Rich Forever pockets too heavy
Y'all niggas ain't ready
Told y'all Rich Forever pockets too heavy
Y'all niggas ain't ready

[Post-Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Ball tomorrow
Rich bought an Audemar
Call up Tavar
Caught a charge
Riding the wave so hard
Everybody wanna go get a Goyard
Y'all niggas ain't ready
Rich Forever pockets too heavy

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid & Famous Dex]
Told y'all niggas ain't ready
AP diamonds and they heavy
I got a bitch named lil betty
She like to whip up my extras
We gettin' money forever
Quarter mil, dug it up with a shovel
Too much water, my diamonds a puddle
Thanking god I came up from the struggle
Wait, I cannot fuck with no busters
Half of these niggas be suckers
Get the bag and I tell them to truck it
Smokin' dope and you know it's so musty
Yeah, we pullin' up with no invitation
I finally made it through dedication
I'm swervin' in something, she devastated
I'm winning, don't need your congratulations
Wait, most of these niggas they hating
Look up and told mama I made it
Don't give a fuck 'bout these ladies
My watch on my wrist cost me eighty
Everybody wanna go this way
Fuck your bitch, make her go that way
Rich, I might pull out a black Wraith
Ain't talking unless it's 'bout Rackaids

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
We pullin' up with no invitation
I finally made it, it's no debatin'
Might walk with a hundred for motivation
My bitches they fuck off a conversation
Told y'all Rich Forever pockets too heavy
Y'all niggas ain't ready
Told y'all Rich Forever pockets too heavy
Y'all niggas ain't ready

[Post-Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Ball tomorrow
Rich bought an Audemar
Call up Tavar
Caught a charge
Riding the wave so hard
Everybody wanna go get a Goyard
Y'all niggas ain't ready
Rich Forever pockets too heavy

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
They wanna copy the wave
They wanna ride the wave
I told my bitch to behave
Might put the coupe through surgery
Trappin' with a lil bit of burglaries
My pockets they look like a burger, B
Your diamonds is rusty, from Tiffany's

[Verse 3: Jay Critch]
You got to be kidding me
Did the rackies and now she into me
Diamonds African, whips from Italy
Niggas chopping up bricks, do surgery
Diamonds cutting up, shits do surgery
She all on my dick, she heard of me
If you look like a lick it's burglary
Red bottoms, kicks look like a murder scene
Get the money, it's simple
Big chopper, shit's poppin' like pimples
Niggas talkin' but that's not what we into
Pull up, put some hoes in your rental
She give me the brain, the mental
Diamonds beating like instrumentals
You ain't getting no guap, why the fuck you waiting?
I might go drop the top for motivation

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
We pullin' up with no invitation
I finally made it, it's no debatin'
Might walk with a hundred for motivation
My bitches they fuck off a conversation
Told y'all Rich Forever pockets too heavy
Y'all niggas ain't ready
Told y'all Rich Forever pockets too heavy
Y'all niggas ain't ready

[Post-Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Ball tomorrow
Rich bought an Audemar
Call up Tavar
Caught a charge
Riding the wave so hard
Everybody wanna go get a Goyard
Y'all niggas ain't ready
Rich Forever pockets too heavy
