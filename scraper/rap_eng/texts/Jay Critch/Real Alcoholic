[Intro]
Damn Stats
Hey, yeah, damn, hey
Jay Critch, Hood Fave
Hey, hey, yeah

[Chorus]
Tonight she a real alcoholic
She put that ass on hydraulics
That ass so fat, need a diet
She got them broke niggas quiet
She a bad bitch, she don't gotta say much
She stackin', she 'bout her paper
The baddest, don't need no makeup
I'm cashin', ball like a Laker
Tonight she a real alcoholic
She put that ass on hydraulics
That ass so fat, need a diet
She got them broke niggas quiet
She a bad bitch, she don't gotta say much
She stackin', she 'bout her paper
The baddest, don't need no makeup
I'm cashin', ball like a Laker

[Verse]
That bitch is looking expensive
I'm tryna fuck, ain't no friendship
Pull up, Iâ€™m making an entrance
I never sit on the benches
My bitch, she came from the trenches
My bitch, she bad, she straight out the hood
She shakin' ass, I gave her the wood
I got the cash, now I'm living good
Tonight she a real alcoholic
She mixin' Henny with Hpnotiq
She know I'm ballin', know I got it
Smack her ass and tell her drop it
She a bad bitch, don't got to say much
She a rich ho, you gotta pay up
Her nigga called and tryna lay up
She know I'm ballin' like a lay-up

[Chorus]
Tonight she a real alcoholic
She put that ass on hydraulics
That ass so fat, need a diet
She got them broke niggas quiet
She a bad bitch, she don't gotta say much
She stackin', she 'bout her paper
The baddest, don't need no makeup
I'm cashin', ball like a Laker
Tonight she a real alcoholic
She put that ass on hydraulics
That ass so fat, need a diet
She got them broke niggas quiet
She a bad bitch, she don't gotta say much
She stackin', she 'bout her paper
The baddest, don't need no makeup
I'm cashin', ball like a Laker
Tonight she a real alcoholic
She put that ass on hydraulics
That ass so fat, need a diet
She got them broke niggas quiet
She a bad bitch, she don't gotta say much
She stackin', she 'bout her paper
The baddest, don't need no makeup
I'm cashin', ball like a Laker
Tonight she a real alcoholic
She put that ass on hydraulics
That ass so fat, need a diet
She got them broke niggas quiet
She a bad bitch, she don't gotta say much
She stackin', she 'bout her paper
The baddest, don't need no makeup
I'm cashin', ball like a Laker
