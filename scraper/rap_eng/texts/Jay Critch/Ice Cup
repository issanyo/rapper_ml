[Hook: Rich The Kid]
Wrist on an ice cup
On my life, diamonds fight
Y’all ain’t sign’t up
Is you ride like a bike
I might pipe her
Flexing like a bitch
I let my doors up
They driving me crazy
She calling my phone
You can’t have my baby
I finally made it
These niggas is mad
They hate that I’m famous
Pull-up coupe thing
With your boo thing
Diamonds on me kicking
Just like Lou Kang

[Verse: Jay Critch]
Pour the pint
KD, I ran the check up
Roll the dice
Headcrack
I got the extras
Nigga get it right
Think them pistols got you messed up
Nigga you ain’t nice
How the fuck you say you next up?
I’m in that TT
I don’t want no fucking Tesla
Lot of VVS
Got me shining from the neck up
730 BG
All my niggas throw the set up
She a dirty lil skeeze
Why she think I’m tryna stress her?
Rookie niggas
Think they Doing Something
Boy you garbage
Boogers on me
VVSs on me
Go retarded
Pussy niggas
They don’t ever finish what they started
Smoking cookie
Got a pound of that Gelato out the garden
