Nigga I was 16 hit my first jugg, niggas doing big things still in the hood
Niggas tryna rob me, I wish a nigga would
I just hit a jugg, now my niggas living good
Me and Juu bang on the block
Run up we bangin up shots
We be gang bangin a lot
So no we don't talk to no cops
I'm ballin Lebron but I do not flop
Imma go get me a diamond watch
Gotta finesse if you want the guap
I'm the king of finessin, do that a lot
What chu know about police raids?
All these bug ass niggas ...
I'm smokin gas in the PJ
I do the dash on the freeway

(Juu Bang)
Critchy got me on a pill
Baby tell me how you feel
Baby tell me how you feel
Shit and I ain't never had a lot
Bitch is you fuckin the gang or not
Man got the Porsche in the lot
I put some ice in my watch
Remember had crack in my sock
Remember I used to play....
I come through with 30's we pullin up
I don't want her she ain't good enough
I just hit her, I don't wanna fuck
Countin money gettin paper-cuts
I just ran right to a bag
LV the buckle and sag
You fuckin Ill pay for your cab
I tatt my name on her ass
I hide that work in my stash
Woke up and chasing some cash

She said that I never link up

I pour henny tell her drink up
Now she give brain yea she think up
That pussy wet, I might sink up

Now I'm leanin off a pink cup
Call the plug, make the pick up
Oh they get the drip from they walk?
I had the sauce before I could talk
Ain't bout money, I don't talk
He talk crazy, leave him chalk

(Juu Bang)

Dam I pour that drink on a regular
