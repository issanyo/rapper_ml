[Hook]
I just wanna get the dough
And shorty sayin' that she love me
You think I really want these hoes?
I just really want the money
Chain on me and it glow
Diamonds on me, make it sunny
It was me and Justot
Mills, Damii, Al Bundy
Tell yo bitch touch her toes
For them bands she get slutty
All my shooters on go
One phone call, it get ugly
Diamonds, they dance
Diamonds, they dance
She say I'm wavy
Shawty, you bad, shawty, you bad, havin' my baby
I need a Lamb', I need a Jag, I need Mercedes
All of these bands, all of these bands, driving me crazy (Driving me crazy)

[Verse]
Before I had bands, she had a man, now she tryna play me
Before I had bands, they ain't give a damn, now I'm moving shady
HAYYYY
Keep the tool around me, cause you never know
Niggas hate on me, it's whatever though
They been waiting on me, now I'm next to blow
Lotta digits nigga, check the O's
Cup full, keep the Henny poured
They want me to lose, still flexing though
I give that girl mollys and xans
Fuckin' your bitch on a hand stand
Stacking them chips for that damn bag
Woahhh
Millz Pull up in that damn Lamb'
Taking pictures, the damn cam
Throwing bullets like I am Cam
Woahhh

[Outro]
I just wanna get the dough
And shorty sayin' that she love me
You think I really want these Hoes?
I just really want the money
Chain on me and it glow
Diamonds on me, make it sunny
It was me and Justot
Mills, Damii, Al Bundy
Tell yo bitch touch her toes
For them bands she get slutty
All my shooters on go
One phone call, it get ugly
Diamonds, they dance
Diamonds, they dance
She say I'm wavy
Shorty, you bad
Shorty, you bad
Havin' my baby
I need a Lamb', I need a Jag, I need Mercedes
All of these bands, all of these bands, driving me crazy (Driving me crazy)
Shorty, you bad, shorty, you bad, havin' my baby
