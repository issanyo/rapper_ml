OGR, OGR

[Hook: Jay Critch]
I lift the doors in the whip like goddamn its out of water
I'm just out here living gods plan wrist holy water
Baby that pussys is dripping fountain, it feel like water
Now im stacking up to the highest mountain money went shorter
Got out the block had to make me a move
We was just out there wildin
Gotta get high to the moon
Just to forget all my problems
I see my niggas get a tune
Some of my niggas on an island
But we still won't lose
Niggas know that i got em

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
Shawty wet like puddles
Momma told me to stay out of trouble
But im sorry my teammate above you
Stepping out Mont Clair bubble
I been balling out ain't need a huddle
I dont wanna fuck i dont wanna cuddle
She get around like the shuttle
That pussy been through the rubble
Chain full of snow get a shovel
Make that money grow make it double
This your hoe she dont love you
We came up from the jungle
Used to dream about it now im blowing up
Now your wifey wanna [?]
In the Maybach almost spilled my cup
Fumble the bag [?]

[Hook: Jay Critch]
I lift the doors in the whip like goddamn its out of water

Got out the block had to make me a move
We was just out there wildin
Gotta get high to the moon
Just to forget all my problems
I see my niggas get a tune
Some of my niggas on an island
But we still won't lose
Niggas know that i got em

[Verse 2: TME Nana]
Just been through the most with the lean
I do the most for the team
Hit the bank and im stuffing my jeans
Watch your back cause it ain't what it seems
Dont wind up having moved with the bean
We pull up and we making a scene
We pull up with the girl of your dreams
We was broke we took off with your lean
We was broke we went half for the bean
Man i done did it all for the green
Man i done did it all for the team
We can fuck but you can't be my bae tho
[?]
Got a price on your head better lay low
Better duck chopper sings like its j lo
Wait, woah
Got all types of whips like im Jango
[?]
Sippin lean pour a four in the mango
And we get to the cash everyday tho
We mixin lean with the kilo
Choppers they move when i say so
Bitch im the boss when i say go
Money it stretch like its Play-Doh
Fuck with the gang and its fatal
Run up and you get a halo
My bottoms up like tomatoes
Yeah i was down bad
Diamonds on my neck go splash
Everything i do bout cash
Baby girl i want my bag
