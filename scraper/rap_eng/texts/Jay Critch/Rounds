[Chorus: Thutmose]
Rounds of applause in the air
Rounds for the table, got the whole crew here
Rounds of applause while I cheer
She do her dance when the money come around 'round like
Money make her dance, she gon' pop it, pop it (Oh yeah)
You've been a good girl, I wanna see you drop it, drop it (Drop it, drop it)
Lift it up, bring it down, I'm the plug, bring the pound
Got a band in my hand, I'ma pop it, pop it (Pop it, pop it)
Money make her dance, she gon' pop it, pop it (Oh yeah)
You've been a good girl, I wanna see you drop it, drop it (Drop it, drop it)
Lift it up, bring it down, I'm the plug, bring the pound
Got a band in my hand, I'ma pop it, pop it

[Verse 1: Thutmose]
Like Bobby Shmurda, right hand, we 'bouta get it rowdy (Oh yeah)
It's two AM in this bitch, but we just getting started (Oh yeah)
I see a chick from ATL, I wanna make my baby girl
If it all goes well, you gon' hear about it (Prr, prr)
Came from the mud, been through it all (Yeah)
Came with my dogs, watch how you walk (Yeah)
Kick down the doors, fuck it, we ball (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Jay Critch]
Cruising in the Lamb lift, the doors on the sh (Doors on sh)
Bankroll on my hand, and it grow and it flip (Growing, growing)
I get all the bands, diamonds froze on my wrist
Money make her dance, she will sell her soul for this shit (Soul for this shit)
In the clubs takin' shot
With no time on the clock (Clock)
If I throw up this money, she gon' make it pop, lock and drop (Drop)
But she can get none from me, I'ma kick her out the spot (Out the spot)
He say he a boss, he not (Not)
Streets cold now the young boy hot

[Chorus: Thutmose]
Rounds of applause in the air (Ha, ha, ha)

Lift it up, bring it down, I'm the plug, bring the pound
Got a band in my hand, I'ma pop it, pop it (Pop it, pop it)
Money make her dance, she gon' pop it, pop it (Oh yeah)
You've been a good girl, I wanna see you drop it, drop it (Drop it, drop it)
