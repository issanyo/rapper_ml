[Intro]
Hey
La música de Harry Fraud

[Chorus]
I be ballin’ right there, where the Knicks play
Get cake, gotta make sure momma’s rent paid (momma’s rent paid)
I was dead broke, got my shit straight
Switch lanes, now they switchin’ up, niggas bitch made (hey)
I been finessin’ since the 6th grade
Switch blade, I might cut a hoe off if her shit fake

[Verse 1]
Blue face, money stacking tall, it’s like 6’8”
New Wraith, stars shinin’ all in you bitch face
It took me a minute, now I’m in the game
Wait a minute, I been sippin’ Henny like it’s Minute Maid
Let ‘em hate, I been gettin’ to it, gettin’ hella paid
Straight away, rollin’ up the sour, gotta meditate (whoa)
Get the guap, I prayin’ it never stop
Wrist on froze, diamonds on me do the Milly Rock
This your hoe? Why she on me when I hit the spot
Big bankrolls, used to post up at a chicken spot
Had a chance but you missed a shot
I can never fold, say you real, but you really not (but you really not)
Movin’ like a hoe get you peeled, niggas bendin’ blocks
You be on the post like O' Neal, you ain’t sendin’ shots (hey)

[Chorus]
I be ballin’ right there where the Knicks play
Get cake, gotta make sure momma’s rent paid (momma’s rent paid)
I was dead broke, got my shit straight
Switch lanes, now they switchin’ up, niggas bitch made (hey)
Bitch, I been finessing since the 6th grade
Switchblade, I might cut her off if her shit fake

[Verse 2]
Wait I just hit your broad, she can’t sit straight
Hey, got a thousand ways just to get paid (get paid)
I’m in BK, tearin’ up the freeway
I just made a fuckin’ highlight, need a replay
I be gettin’ to it every night, what’s the delay
Remember when I was down, tables turn like a DJ (hey)
Shawty, you should leave your man, he a cheapskate (cheapskate)
I can make a lotta bands on a weekday (lotta bands)
She know that I’m the man, ain't no de-bate (I’m the man)
I used to sell the grams like its eBay
I’ma do the dash like a relay
Talkin’ money, I just split the cash on a 3-way
Sippin’ Henny, gave your bitch a splash of the E&J
In a Bentley, when I'm going pass thru the speed race
Aye, I’m cut her off, bitch I need space (need space)
I don't want your heart, I just need face (I just need face)
I been on my grind, boy you need skates (need skates)
I got in the game like its EA (EA)

[Chorus]
I be ballin’ right there where the Knicks play
Get cake, gotta make sure momma’s rent paid (momma’s rent paid)
I was dead broke, got my shit straight
Switch lanes, now they switchin’ up, niggas bitch made (hey)
Bitch, I been finessing since the 6th grade
Switchblade, I might cut her off if her shit fake

[Outro]
Wait, I just hit your broad, she can’t sit straight
Hey, got a thousand ways just to get paid
Hey, hey, hey

“I’m sorry are you a-a, Mister Homie D. Clown?”
“No, I’m Harry D. Fraud”
