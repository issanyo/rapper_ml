Started chasing my dream, now they knowing my name
Shout out P.Dice cause he showed me the way, aye

Riding the masi I feel like the man (Skrrt)

[Verse 2: Jay Critch]
Getting the green, getting the green, wrist on freeze
Hop out of the foreign onto the jet, straight to the cheese
Heard they tryna plot, they tryna scheme, 30s with me
Going straight to the top, they cannot stop, ain't on the team
Nah, really though, I ain't got time for no silly hoe
I make some bands in a millie though
Keep a small circle like cheerios (Hayyy)
Nah, really though, we pull up they tryna take videos
I got your wifey on video
She eating now cause we got plenty dough (Hayyy)
Whats up with you, nigga got bucks to loose
So I cannot fuck with you, hey, stay with a slut or two
Niggas talking, they ain't talking no money
Pull up, get to drumming or something
All my niggas got to get to the hundreds (Hayyy)
With the gang smoking loud out the onion (Yeah)
