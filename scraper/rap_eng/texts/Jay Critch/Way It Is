[Chorus]
Stop all that frontin', I can't take that shit
A lot of money, gotta make that shit
They act like they love it but they hate that shit
She said that she love me, I replace the bitch
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it go

[Verse 1]
Running to a bag, what they waiting for?
I just left the jeweler, made it rain and snow
Pockets long like rulers but I still need more
Diamonds on me cooler when I'm lifting up the doors
You gon' break your pockets doing shit you can't afford
I was on the block, I wasn't trying to do no chores
Tresso tell me "Let's go hit a stain" I'm like "Of course"
Bitch I took a shot and won the game late in the fourth
My bitch from over the water, I'm calling drugs for the water
Avianne my chain, I don't order
The pack came from over the border
Exploring the money like Dora
Money piling from the floor up
I'ma cash out, close the store up
Bring the racks out, put some more up

[Chorus]
Stop all that frontin', I can't take that shit
A lot of money, gotta make that shit
They act like they love it but they hate that shit
She said that she love me, I replace the bitch
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it go

[Verse 2]
I hit them licks, then I got it off, I made it flip
I'm trying to get rich, I'm walking around with a lot of blue chips
Can't trust that bitch, won't give her my heart
'Cause the ho gon' switch
She on my dick, 'cause she know I ball, she know how I live
On to something, that nigga on to something
Every time a new song is coming
Like I'm dropping a bomb or something
Look at my arm, it's flooded, might hit your broad and dub it
Gotta make it from the bottom, my niggas all above it
Cali weed, rolled up in the Backwoods
These niggas be living so backwards
First thing's first, Jay gotta have it
When we see the damn bag, gotta grab it
Balmain, paid a lot for the fabric
But I make it right back, like I'm trapping
Found the money, GPS with the tracking
Your rent price stay on my fabric

[Chorus]
Stop all that frontin', I can't take that shit
A lot of money, gotta make that shit
They act like they love it but they hate that shit
She said that she love me, I replace the bitch
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it go
