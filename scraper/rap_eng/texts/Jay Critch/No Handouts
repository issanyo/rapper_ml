Hey!

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
My niggas doing they thang
Duckin' police and the search warrants (and the search warrants)
Might pull up in some designer
You ain't see these, gotta search for it (gotta search for it)
These rappers ridin, the wave
Bitches on dick like a surfboard (like a surfboard)
You know I gotta get paid
Ice on my neck cause I worked for it (cause I worked for it)
Money talking fit in the lamb now (skr)
They gon' try to fit in Imma stand out (skr skr)
Niggas come around askin' for handouts (for handouts)
What you did when my pockets was man down (when i was broke)
Boy you funny you act like my mans now (no)

Then we start jugging we get to the bands now
Cooking up like I'm bringing a pan out

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]

They dont want problems with me
Hit a jug, yeah I'm shopping for free (jug)

Say you real, but nobody agree (hey!)
It gon' be jumping like it's on TV
I gotta stay with a bean (plow plow)
Told her don't call me, I ain't trying to speak
Hit me when they saw the green
New faces, got me like "who are these niggas and why they around?" (who are these niggas)
Blue faces, I got a stack to the ceiling that start from the ground
In the coupe racing, I might pull up on your bitch (skr)
Dropping the top down (skr skr)
Niggas pocket watching what i got now (pocket watching)
Had some light shit, got a lot now (hey!)

[Verse 3: Vendetta]
I just got a pint of the tech
Take off, get high like NASA (get high)
I don't want that bitch you can have her (you can have that bitch)
Smoke strong, gotta flex throwin' 50s (gotta flex)
And I'm all in her mouth like a dentist
Kick back then I ball like Alonzo
Rollin' with a paper and a frontal
Sit back hit a bitch with a combo
And I gotta play the bitch like a console
She be suckin' on my dick in the condo
Pronto, hit a lick get the guap though
No vegan I'm all about green
Get that money, I stack with my team
My nigga you sippin' the clean
Goyard the belt on my jeans
Maison Margiela the feet
And I gotta eat (I gotta eat)

[Chorus]
My niggas doing they thang
Duckin' police and the search warrants

You ain't see these, gotta search for it
These rappers riding the wave
Bitches on dick like a surfboard
You know I gotta get paid
Ice on my neck cause I worked for it
Money talking fit in the lamb now
They gon' try to fit in, I'ma stand out
Niggas come around askin' for handouts
What you did when my pockets was man down
Boy you funny you act like my mans now
She was frontin' but look she a fan now
Then we start jugging we get to the bands now
Cooking up like I'm bringing a pan out
