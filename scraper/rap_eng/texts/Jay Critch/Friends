[Chorus: Selli Paper]
We don’t do friends no we don’t do friends
Now i have hundred (?) to spent
Feel like Gucci, Versace my lean's
Bitch (?) how to win
[…]
She told me about my risk
Look like i gotta (?) to (?) friends
We don’t do friends no we don’t do friends
We don’t do friends no we don’t do friends
We don’t do friends no we don’t do friends
We don’t do friends no we don’t do friends

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
Hop out the benz straight to the loot
My bitch a 10 she whip it cool
Callin' up friends they comin' through
Money don’t end I never loose
No foreign at the block & I bend the rules
How I get the guap might embarrass you
I be at the top with no parachute
Bitch tryn' give me top for a pair of shoes
But she can’t have shit, nigga I’m tryna get rich
Niggas don’t flex like this
The water my wrist
Shorty just stay on my dick
I know her nigga is sucks
She want me to hit
Stone cold diamonds bustin
Talkin' do' there ain’t no discussion
We all know he be fronting
He ain’t never sell a O' or nothing
I just gotta get that do and run it back to end zone nigga
You be tryna hit hat hoe forever
You still in the friend zone nigga
Cross ya out like tic tac toe
I’m rockin Balmain with the Kenzo nigga
Remember we used to kick back ?
Running off with the packs for the bandz my nigga

[Chorus: Selli Paper]
We don’t do friends no we don’t do friends
[…]
We don’t do friends no we don’t do friends
We don’t do friends no we don’t do friends
We don’t do friends no we don’t do friends
We don’t do friends no we don’t do friends

[Verse 2: Selli Paper]
She see my chains she think I’m cool
You diamonds fake, my shit the truth
?
Drop the top off the Bentley shoot out the roof
