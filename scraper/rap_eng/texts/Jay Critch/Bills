[Intro]
Aye, Jay Crich Hood Fav
Talk Money Gang
30 that, hold on
Rich Forever Way

[Chorus]
Aye
Fuck how you feel, ain't hard to find me
Diamonds got gills that's avianne
I'm bout my bills, Clinton and Cosby
She taking pills, sucking me sloppy
She let me kill up in the Mazi
I'm in the field, you in the lobby
A'int got no deal, she call me papi
House on the hill got figures like Tommy
That money talkin' I'm like copy
Sign't up, better get with the program
Popped one and she said she want more Xans
Said she tryin' forget about her old man
Gotta walk with the ice like a snowman
Niggas ain't talkin' nice, they get no bands
Lotta Henny I got her wide open
Clean soda I mix up the potion

[Verse]
Made a play then I put it in motion
AP, put my wrist in the ocean
Play me, have them shooters on focus
I've been ballin' they already know this
I was down but I learned a lesson
Hundred rounds, my 30's got weapons
You don't want trouble get the message
Need a stunt double how I'm flexin'
Montcler bubble now she texting
I might blow a bag, that's investment
She a broke bitch, you invested
Need a broke wrist, water necklace
Need my crib bigger than the Westin
She gon' suck me up, give me blessings
When I'm pulling up, fuck your guest list
I came with the thugs and the weapons
Diamonds hittin' Sonny Liston
Chain going fishing, big shot like the Pistons
Diamonds got her blowing kisses
Look how it glisten, have the bitch makin' wishes
In my hood they call me KD cause I'm ballin'
But I can't do no switchin'
Stack on your head now you eight feet, leave you missin'
You ain't gang, niggas dissin'

[Chorus]
Aye
Fuck how you feel, ain't hard to find me
Diamonds got gills that's avianne
I'm bout my bills, Clinton and Cosby
She taking pills, sucking me sloppy
She let me kill up in the Mazi
I'm in the field, you in the lobby
A'int got no deal, she call me papi
House on the hill got figures like Tommy
That money talkin' I'm like copy
Sign't up, better get with the program
Popped one and she said she want more Xans
Said she tryin' forget about her old man
Gotta walk with the ice like a snowman
Niggas ain't talkin' nice, they get no bands
Lotta Henny I got her wide open
Clean soda I mix up the potion
