[Intro: Jay Critch]
I wanted the racks
So i had to get it then (hey)
Jay Critch hood fav (woah)

[Hook: Jay Critch]
I wanted the racks
So i had to get it then (I had to get it then)
I just keep smoking a pack
Sippin' the medicine (sippin' the medicine)
She was frontin' way back
Now i bet that she gon' let me in (now she gon' let me in)
My shooter come with the strap
They ain't know he gonna let it rain (grrrow)
And they know it
They hating, i gotta stay focused
My wrist is on water, the ocean (like the ocean)
Homie affording the potion
Imma bust on her face like lotion (hey)
Kicked her out, now she pissed off
Im in the hood with the big dogs
Diamonds is jumping like criss cross

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
Got her caught up in the moment
Like this some moves when she auction
Yea nigga, steady trapping, i'm dully
Some of my niggas be whipping the stully's
I let em' move that i'm smoking no poting
Talking that money
You already know it
I got the shorty
Yea she gonna blow it
Hitting the gas
The foreign, we going
All in designer
It cost a few thousand
Then i go back
I had to fuck up a thousand
Why these niggas always hating
Moving the work on the pavement
Got a new whip like a slave ship
Hoe in the four store within the matrix
Nigga be scoring moving like im Peyton
Fucking that bitch and that nigga not dating
Stacking the money
Im getting the payments

[Verse 2: Jay Critch]
You know that i roll with the real ones
Yea i'm numb, i can't feel nun'
Teddy be scoring
Yea i get an and 1
Im up in the studio making the anthems
You got a question, well i got the answer
I'm on the roll like a Lanson
Then pull on her panties
She pop a xanny
Money be older than granny
I know a nigga can't stand me
Why you watching what im doing
Money persuing
Nigga be balling like Ewing
Flight to the tropics
Spin like a sprocket
Stop at the Nas shit
Shit it be all in my conscience
Nigga you done with the drama
My team is all in designer
And yea we be stacking the commas
Toting the grip like Osama
Yea we ready for the problems
