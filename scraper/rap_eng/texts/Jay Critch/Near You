[Intro: Rich The Kid]
Yeah
This one of them, uh
One of them 80's motherfuckers, ain't it?
Turn it up on the headphones a little more, yeah
Know how the fuck we comin' man
TheLabCook

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Bring her closer, that's your girl, might bend her over
When it's over, I'ma act like I don't know her
The Bentley it get her excited, feel like an ocean inside it
I love the way that she ride it, I'm flexin' on you and she like it
In my coupe, it's a boo, I need two
She gon' come right back just like them bands do
Boy you love her, took that ho to Cancun
I can't cuff no bitch, no I can't spare you

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
Ayy, niggas mad I'm doin' shit they can't do
Ayy, diamonds goin' apeshit like a baboon
And I'm tryna keep my niggas out the can too
Thirty gang, every shot in, we some damn goons
She suckin' me up, got a man too
I get to the bucks and the lambs, ooh
Step in the club, diamonds blam, ooh
My niggas stick to the plan, cool
You run up on me, you a damn fool
Eating good, used to be canned food
In the hood walkin' with bands too
Water on me like the damn pool

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Pussy wet, drip, make her cum quick
Pull your weave bitch, then I leave bitch
Bentayga, it get her excited
But you don't know nothin' about it
You ridin' that petty lil Audi
She ask me to break her lil body

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Bring her closer, that's your girl, might bend her over
When it's over, I'ma act like I don't know her
The Bentley it get her excited, feel like an ocean inside it
I love the way that she ride it, I'm flexin' on you and she like it
In my coupe, it's a boo, I need two
She gon' come right back just like them bands do
Boy you love her, took that ho to Cancun
I can't cuff no bitch, no I can't spare you

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Bring her closer, she too fine, you know I stole her
Make her sing, but you love her, bought a ring
And my wrist drip, we don't take pics
My lil freak bitch, make her backflip
Balenciaga on her shoe, ooh
She bad as hell, I need two, ooh
That pussy so good but I can't cuff on you
Yehah, and my top gone, she get her top blown
Fuck your bitch, I got some Louis socks on

[Verse 4: Jay Critch]
So much designer, that bitch don't know what I got on
I'm in that BM with your BM and the top gone
I'm jumpin' out of that Ghost, color popcorn
Remember pullin' up, jumpin' out for that dope, then I got on

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Bring her closer, that's your girl, might bend her over
When it's over, I'ma act like I don't know her
The Bentley it get her excited, feel like an ocean inside it
I love the way that she ride it, I'm flexin' on you and she like it
In my coupe, it's a boo, I need two
She gon' come right back just like them bands do
Boy you love her, took that ho to Cancun
I can't cuff no bitch, no I can't spare you
