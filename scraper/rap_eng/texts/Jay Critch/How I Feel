[Intro]
I ball 'cause it's just how I feel
I ball 'cause it's just how I feel
They like "somebody get him a deal"
No, he ain't missin' no meals
Aye, aye

[Chorus]
I ball 'cause it's just how I feel (no)
Somebody get him a deal (no)
No, he ain't missin' no meals (no meals)
On the block, posted up like O'Neal (aye)
You ain't talkin' money, just keep it sealed
I got the lean in a seal (lean in a seal)
Told her "pop out to the link" (link)
She just wanna smoke, wanna drink (wanna drink)
She give me brain, but she don't think (neck)
My bitch yellow, cup pink (aye)
Redbone, she thick (aye)
Aye, then my cell phone ring (aye)
Hotline on bling (hey)
Ever since I hit a lick (whoa)

[Verse]
Told her "pop out to the pull up" (pull up)
Still shittin' like Pull-Ups (aye)
Still smokin' on the good stuff (dope)
And my pockets doin' pushups
Wish my enemies good luck (aye)
After I fill 'em with shells (boom, boom, boom, bow)
My hoes got class like school (hey)
But they don't get saved by the bell (no)
Hit it, then tell her farewell
Servin' weight, no scale
Flexin', you niggas so frail (frail)
Smokin' loud, and it smell (dope)
Aye, aye
I kick down the door, that's a burglary
Better wife her if she never heard of me
Red bottoms, I walked through a murder scene
Police snatch me up, I ain't heard a thing (heard a thing)
Say he put in work, I ain't heard a thing (hey)
Nigga want beef, then it's Burger King (hey)
Say, that nigga want beef, then it's Burger King (bow)
Little bitch lookin' for juug
Set up a plate for the green, bitch (for the green, bitch)
Bitch runnin' off on the plug
Plies throw me on the remix
She see me pop bottles of bud
Then she turn into a fiend, bitch
You either my brother or a opp
I don't do in between shit (aye)
Niggas they [?] seamless (ha)
Aye, if I say it, I mean it (aye)
Yuh, aye

[Chorus]
I ball 'cause it's just how I feel (aye)
They like "somebody get him a deal" (aye)
No, he ain't missin' no meals (no meals)
On the block, posted up like O'Neal (like O'Neal)
You ain't talkin' money, just keep it sealed
I got the lean in a seal (lean in a seal)
Told her "pop out to the link" (to the link up)
She just wanna smoke, wanna drink (wanna drink up)
She give me brain, but she don't think (neck)
My bitch yellow, cup pink (pink)
Redbone, she thick (she thick)
Then my cell phone ring (forget about it)
Hotline on bling (aye)
Ever since I hit a lick (juug)
