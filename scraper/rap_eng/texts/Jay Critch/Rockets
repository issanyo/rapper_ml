[Hook]
(HEY!)
Pull out the lot, the coupe
I got a lot to lose
I got the guap, you lose
I'ma go get a watch or two
Diamonds hittin' like a boxer do
We ain't tuckin' chains, know we got the tool
She don't fuck with lames, know we got the loot (Aye)
(HEY!)
New foreign, I might pull out the Tesla
Rich Forever walk around with the extras
Got some diamonds but you fold under pressure (Got some diamonds but you fold under pressure!) (Aye)
Hide your diamonds, niggas snatchin' yo necklace
Get the money, stack it up like it's Tetris
Rockets on me like I'm playing for Texas (Rockets on me like I'm playing for Texas!)
(Aye)

[Verse]
New bag, cross it off of my checklist
Get some cash and these niggas turn reckless
Spent your last, hope you learnin' a lesson (Hope you learnin' a lesson!) (Bitch)
Do the dash, shorty say "that's impressive"
I can not switch up, but I'm ballin' like Kevin
I need a Brink's truck, money stackin' to heaven (Look at my, wrist!) (Aye)
They on that groupie shit, spreadin' that gossip
But they ain't doin' shit, why are they talkin'?
I'm in the newest whip, why are they walkin'? (They on that groupie shit!)
Burberry, mix it up with the load
Pillsbury, gotta get to the dough
Neck cold like zero below (ICE!)
She givin' throat, but that was your hoe
Smoking dope, she snortin' the coke (HEY!)
I was broke, but I had to glow
We talking bankrolls, you gotta go (You gotta go!)
Red bottoms, spikes on the toes
Feds got 'em, that nigga told
And I just hit a lick, like three in a row (Jugg)
And I don't need a bitch, niggas fiendin for hoes (Don't need a bitch!)
(Aye)

[Hook]
Pull out the lot, the coupe (Lot the coupe!)
I got a lot to lose
I got the guap, you lose (Guap, you lose)
I'ma go get a watch or two
Diamonds hittin' like a boxer do
We ain't tuckin' chains, know we got the tool (Grrah!)
She don't fuck with lames, know we got the loot (Know we got the loot)
(Aye)
New foreign, I might pull out the Tesla
Rich Forever walk around with the extras
Got some diamonds, but you fold under pressure (Got some diamonds, but you fold under pressure!) (Aye)
Hide your diamonds, niggas snatchin' yo necklace
Get the money, stack it up like it's Tetris
Rockets on me like I'm playing for Texas (Hey!)
(Aye)
