[Intro: Jay Critch & Rich The Kid]
Rich Forever shit
Hey
The Lab Cook
Hey

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
I know what to do to get that bag right (that bag right)
I been gettin' used to what that cash like
Hit a stain nigga, gotta make a move, live a fast life
In the Wraith nigga, stars on the roof, thinkin' bout my past life (skrrt, skrrt)
If you lookin' for me, find me where the cash is (where the cash is)
Like gymnastics, money do the backflips (do the backflips)
I'm with a bad bitch, she got her ass did (got her ass did)
After I smash it, treat her like she average

[Verse 1: Jay Critch & Rich The Kid]
Put her in the background like my adlibs (like my adlibs)
She said, "Please don't pour that up 'cause you start crashin'" (lean, lean)
Ain't a addict, I just gotta have it (gotta have it)
Plus we have it, heard your plug be taxin' (heard your plug be taxin')
Today, I'm lookin' for a car to do the dash in (skrrt, skrrt)
Hood fav', I'm livin' large, I'm livin' lavish (hood fav')
I seen that money from afar, you niggas passed it (you niggas passed it, hey)
Talkin' money, say she hear it in my accent (in my accent)
It's lookin' funny, boy, them diamonds lookin' plastic (lookin' plastic)
Diamonds on me running, diamonds on me active (diamonds on me active)
The way I flexin' that Fenny, they think I clapped it (they think I clapped it)
That water on me confetti, I get the bag in (get the bag)

[Chorus: Jay Critch & Rich The Kid]
I know what to do to get that bag right (get that bag right)
I been gettin' used to what that cash like
Hit a stain nigga, gotta make a move, live a fast life
In the Wraith nigga, stars on the roof, thinkin' bout my past life (skrrt, skrrt)
If you lookin' for me, find me where the cash is (where the cash is, hah)
Like gymnastics, money do the backflips (do the backflips, hah)
I'm with a bad bitch, she got her ass did (huh)
After I smash it, treat her like she average (hey)

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Called that bitch a Uber 'cause she average (huh?)
Whoa, pussy-ass rapper, he a actress (you a bitch)
I just made a milly yesterday, bitch (milly)
Mo' chains on me than a convict (what?)
Ooh, gimme face, I don't go on dates (ho, whoa)
Tryna pour a four, I might crash the Wraith (lean, lean, lean, lean)
Land the joint on a trampoline, I had to put down the triple-bean
Thinkin' bout nights I was juggin' (juggin')
Kick her out the coupe, I don't want the pussy (nope)
Fast life, momma trippin', but my cash right (cash right)
If it feel real dark, they did her ass right (whoa)
Keep that bag (keep that bag), run it up, go the dash (skrrt)
Why they mad? (mad)
Rich Forever, too much cash (rich)

[Chorus: Jay Critch & Rich The Kid]
I know what to do to get that bag right (that bag right)
I been gettin' used to what that cash like
Hit a stain nigga, gotta make a move, live a fast life
In the Wraith nigga, stars on the roof, thinkin' bout my past life (skrrt, skrrt)
If you lookin' for me, find me where the cash is (where the cash is, hah)
Like gymnastics, money do the backflips (do the backflips, hah)
I'm with a bad bitch, she got her ass did (huh)
After I smash it, treat her like she average (hey)
