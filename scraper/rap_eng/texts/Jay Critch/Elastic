[Intro: Mally Bandz & (Jay Critch)]
Bands all on me like I'm elastic (bands all on me like it's elastic)
Bands all on me like I'm elastic (bands all on me like it's elastic)
Hatin' on me, go get a bag bitch (hating on me, go get a bag)
Bands all on me like I'm elastic (I'm elastic)
Hatin' on me go get a bag bitch (Go get a bag bitch)
She nothing special, check out my last bitch (check out my last bitch)
Damn [?]
(Ahhh)

[Chorus: Mally Bandz & (Jay Critch)]
Bands all on me like I'm elastic (like I'm elastic)
Hatin' on me, go get a bag bitch (hating on me go get a bag)
She nothing special, check out my last bitch (check out my last)
Smoke in Ferrari, might end up crashing (might end up crashing)
Brand new Ferrari I do the dash in it (I do the dash)
She give me brain like she got glasses, okay (shawty give me brain)
All of those days, didn't go to class yeah, okay
Police pull me over, don't know what happened (police pull me over, don't know what happened)

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
(Hey!)
I dreamed about the bag and made it happen
Yellow bone, she live on my mattress
Louis V head to toe, my diamonds attacking
In the Rari, two door but i want the Ashton (shkrt shkrt)
And you too slow, get some figures, get some cash in
Get a tombstone, lay a finger on this fashion (shkrt shkrt)
And my new hoe looking like she won a pageant
Baby you know, I make the money do a backflip
And I want you shawty, I don't need you
I've been flexing up, Vin Diesel
And I'm smoking gas, smoking diesel
My life's a movie like Regal
I pour up some muddy, make a sequel
These shoes bloody like 'nevil
These streets turn a nigga evil
Posted on the block like 32

[Chorus: Mally Bandz & (Jay Critch)]
Bands all on me like I'm elastic (like I'm elastic)
Hatin' on me, go get a bag bitch (hating on me go get a bag)
She nothing special, check out my last bitch (check out my last)
Smoke in Ferrari, might end up crashing (might end up crashing)
Brand new Ferrari I do the dash in it (I do the dash)
She give me brain like she got glasses, okay (shawty give me brain)
All of those days didn't go to class yeah, okay
Police pull me over, don't know what happened (police pull me over, don't know what happened)
