[Hook]
I just pulled up with some Gs
He got a pack we gon' get him
I had to balmain the denim
They gon' play you if you let 'em
Go get the money that's bottom line
Ran off with the pack 'bout a hundred time
Imma pull out that Wraith for the summer time
Niggas droppin' dimes like number 9
Remember them nights we were starving
My niggas ducking them charges
Step back, James Harden
Get the money we working the hardest
Imma go and take over the city
BK we cashing out vinnies
He say get money he silly
Pull up where he stay, run up with them digits

[Verse 1]
You ain't making no moves, you talk it we live it
Run down with the tool, we take it and split it
I'm up in the booth, cup full of Henny
VS on my tooth ain't been broke in a minute
Move how I move, nigga get with it
Bitch I can't lose, my niggas winning
Imma fuck her one time and then I tell her good riddance
Fuck her two times sign my name on her titty

[Verse 2]
Big knots get the bands
Free Rico out that jam
Get some money they act like they fam
Remember riding a bus, need a Lam
I got up, made a move, wow
Need a birds, need a few thou
Me and Bundy smoking too loud
What these niggas tryna do now
What these niggas really doing, nothing
I got shooters and they up to something
They gon' pull out with them toasters, ovens
Say he gettin bankrolls, be bluffin
Fucking on your main hoe, Mcloving
We pull up deep in like 4 Vs
Tell these pussy niggas, hold these
'Member watching for the police
