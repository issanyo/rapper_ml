[Intro]
Aye, yea
Know what the fuck it is
Talk Money Gang
Jay Critch featuring Vendetta you know what the fuck is up bro
It don't matter where I go
Big Domi in this bitch
Aye

[Chorus]
(I'm) Ahead of you, Balenci' the shoes
Red and blue, ducking from red and blues
Come through like a bruise red and blue
I got bloods I got crips get a clue
Hit a stain on the pack of the booth
Give me top in the whip got her legs out the roof
No it ain't no deuce-deuce when we shoot
No we cannot be cool, who is you?

[Jay Critch]
(Aye)
She gon' let me fuck then she walk it out
I be stacking bucks till I couldn't count
Tryna get the fuck out my momma house
Then spend some more bucks on my momma house
I heard the ops don't want drama now
They heard we brought some new llamas out
Your bitch heard we rock designer now
Your bitch heard we rock designer now
Aye, she all in the condo now
Yea, she swallow now
She give me facetime like we skyping
My pieces  hitting like Tyson
That bitch a vacuum like Dyson
That mean she give me the brain
You know the game never change
You know I stay on the wave
She want that old Critch, nah, I don't hold hands
She want that young Critch, nah, I'm a grown man
Niggas on they young shit they ain't touching no bands
Hit it from the back now she walking like a old man (I'm)

[Chorus]
Ahead of you, Balenci' the shoes
Red and blue, ducking from red and blues
Come through like a bruise red and blue
I got bloods I got crips get a clue
Hit a stain on the pack of the booth
Give me top in the whip got her legs out the roof
No it ain't no deuce-deuce when we shoot
No we cannot be cool, who is you?

[Verse 2]
I fuck her I'm burning some calories
She talk that shit when she mad at me
Off where the thotties be in it at
Four change on me no Olympian
Get that shit and then we movin it that's a fact
Tap yo ass up with that ruger clap
Humble nigga but I'm lookin for stupid racks
All my niggas they be with it to take it back
Yeah, aye, hey
She ride like a frixie and she hold my blicky
When shiggy get sticky and that is my bitch yeah
And she with the shits if you disrespect her
Then I empty clips yeah
I really had activist niggas be fronting
My money do back to back to back flips
And I got the racket tense I gotta flip
Her panties leaking dripping out and shit
Popped a xannie I might take your shit
T and me gang
I seen so many niggas that I can't remember
And my diamonds colder than a winter
If you ask about me you would know I'm winning
But I'm always sending probably on a mission
Tryna get the digits money never mention
Money never missing (Aye)
Playing shawty like a game
I ain't with it for the fame
Getting money make it last
Cause a nigga was ashamed
Shout to home I know the pain
Shout to home I know the pain
Niggas ain't know the story
That's why i joined a fucking gang

[Chorus]
(I'm) Ahead of you, Balenci' the shoes
Red and blue, ducking from red and blues
Come through like a bruise red and blue
I got bloods I got crips get a clue
Hit a stain on the pack of the booth
Give me top in the whip got her legs out the roof
No it ain't no deuce-deuce when we shoot
No we cannot be cool, who is you?
