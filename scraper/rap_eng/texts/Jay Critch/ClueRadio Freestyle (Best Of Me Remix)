[Verse]
Yes we all in, Jay Critch be balling
Might hit it then leave out in the morning
Getting to the money while ya niggas be stalling
I Remember mom dukes told me to get the fuck out
I can't even blame her I was moving like a bug out
Now I'm tryna have them diamonds shining like the sun out
I was like 11 when them police run down
Used to play ball, that shit not fun now
Ever since my brother d block got gunned down
Had to start walking with a gun now
By the time you reach for it, we already got guns out
Would've thought it's s Canarsie how I'm flossy
Bad bitches all on me but get em off me
Balenciaga feets don't ask what it cost me
Niggas try to ride the wave I'm to saucy
And that bitch ride dick like a Harley
I be smoking out the zip like I'm Marley
And I make that money flip like Jeff Hardy
You might find me on A block eating Hardys
You might find me on carnar ave with the squadie
Or Find me on block block with the 30
Swear I love my niggas, for my niggas do you dirty
Come through smelling like the loud, know they heard me
When they can do the shit
They gon doubt you when they can't do the shit
Seen the finished line from far then I ran through the shit
Put the work in, I sing  talking a hand full of bricks
I got a purpose and I ain't never ran from no shit
Ask my shorty, she'll say I only ran through her clique
Like "yeah jay been balling since a kid like he ran with the Knicks
Stay melo off the grams of the piff
Know he rap I'm a big fan of his"
Well one day I'll ll be a lot less humble
To hear me clearly you sounding a lot more mumble
I'm a real one from he concrete jungle
For the after party need a telly or two
Look at the view probably look like heaven to you
Niggas start comparing so they can feel better than you
You had a good look and blew it, I can never be you
Send shots where I come from, move like veterans do
Send shots where I come, better keep a weapon or two
Stay with techs like they weapons is glued
I get the green like vegetable food
