[Chorus: Jay Critch]
Hop in the Maybach cruisin'
I get the cake, they lose it
I get the cake, hoes choosin'
These niggas fake, we do it
Hoppin' up in the Wraith, zoomin'
Sippin' a lil drank, snoozin'
Walking into the bank, foolish
Tryna copy, you can't do it
Ho tried to play me, I ain't stupid
She wanna lay up, I ain't cupid
We just get up and get straight to it
Just bought a K, I got nothin' to say to it
I'ma cash out and get right back
We showin' off, he ain't like that
Workin' the most, spend a light bag
In the new freezer, that's an icepack

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
Wish these hatin' niggas good luck
Cali smokin' on the good stuff
New Benz, I'm like good work
Diamonds dancing, they got footwork
Yo chick be texting talkin' 'bout pouring fours
She ain't suckin' then the bitch gotta go
Me and bunny ballin' like pick and roll
I had nothin', posted right by the store
In the foreign, I'm with Rico and Doe
Hood favorite, I'ma put on a show
Good drank, get it in for the low
To the face, good blunt and the dope
Gotta stay safe nigga, walk with a pole
These niggas actin' like shooters, they ain't
These niggas never gon' bang
Gotta watch out for these niggas, they fake
These niggas never could hang
I need them diamonds that look like a lake
Diamonds looking like the rain
Shawty I ain't tryna hear what you think, Backwoods for the pain
Hey, ballin' like EA Sports but I'm not with the games
In the foreign, she giving me brain
He a dork, why he fuckin' with lames

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
Hop in the Maybach cruisin'
I get the cake, they lose it
I get the cake, hoes choosin'
These niggas fake, we do it
Hoppin' up in the Wraith, zoomin'
Sippin' a lil drank, snoozin'
Walking into the bank, foolish
Tryna copy, you can't do it
Ho tried to play me, I ain't stupid
She wanna lay up, I ain't cupid
We just get up and get straight to it
Just bought a K, I got nothin' to say to it
I'ma cash out and get right back
We showin' off, he ain't like that
Workin' the most, spend a light bag
In the new freezer, that's an icepack

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
Hundred K, spend this shit on a foreign
Bad bitch suck me up in the morning
Catch an opp like an opp in the morning
Niggas lame, swear to god they be phony
Don't want the Rollie, it's boring
Wait, I was just broke as some storage
Now it's the bitches adore me
She wanna pop a lil pill
I got her off molly, these bitches so horny
I used to sell the rerock
Whip my left wrist in the pot
Trappin' hard on the block
Made 50K, put it right in my Reebok
I'm in the Maybach cruisin'
I'm ballin' hard, you losin'
I do not beef on computers
Extra percent for my shooter, Dexter

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
Hop in the Maybach cruisin'
I get the cake, they lose it
I get the cake, hoes choosin'
These niggas fake, we do it
Hoppin' up in the Wraith, zoomin'
Sippin' a lil drank, snoozin'
Walking into the bank, foolish
Tryna copy, you can't do it
Ho tried to play me, I ain't stupid
She wanna lay up, I ain't cupid
We just get up and get straight to it
Just bought a K, I got nothin' to say to it
I'ma cash out and get right back
We showin' off, he ain't like that
Workin' the most, spend a light bag
In the new freezer, that's an icepack

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Bentley truck, I was riding the chain
I wanna fuck but she playin' games
Rich Forever, boy that's the gang gang
Need some more water, I don't want a plain jane
Pull out my racks and I flex on you rappers
They really some actors
I Gucci'd my slippers, it really don't matter
My pockets is fatter
I can feel the hate
Broke but now we straight
We don't do no talking
We just pull up for that cake
Like I'm a fat boy
We in the sky like an astroid
Give her the molly, she ask for it
She losin' her mind and her back boy

[Chorus: Jay Critch]
Hop in the Maybach cruisin'
I get the cake, they lose it
I get the cake, hoes choosin'
These niggas fake, we do it
Hoppin' up in the Wraith, zoomin'
Sippin' a lil drank, snoozin'
Walking into the bank, foolish
Tryna copy, you can't do it
Ho tried to play me, I ain't stupid
She wanna lay up, I ain't cupid
We just get up and get straight to it
Just bought a K, I got nothin' to say to it
I'ma cash out and get right back
We showin' off, he ain't like that
Workin' the most, spend a light bag
In the new freezer, that's an icepack
