[Hook: Jay Critch]
I hit the plug, what you got for me
I ran off with the knots on me
I feel like I need a chop on me
I feel like somebody watching me
I hit the plug, what you got for me
I ran off with the knots on me
I feel like I need a chop on me
I feel like somebody watching me
I hit the plug, what you got for me
I ran off with the knots on me
I feel like I need a chop on me
I feel like somebody watching me
I hit the plug, what you got for me
I ran off with the knots on me
I feel like I need a chop on me
I feel like somebody watching me

Tell him so long, I remember you, you was doubting
Money so long, now I stack it up to the mountain
I'm like hold on, I just put my wrist in the fountain
Money grow long [?] like I play for the Falcons

[Verse: Jay Critch]
That nigga just talk a lot he ain't 'bout shit
My diamonds they walk it out, diamonds shouting
Bitch it's Talk Money Gang we ain't scouting
I stay with my brothers ain't no way around it
Stack up my change, got shit to do
They say you change, they switch on you
Way too much drip, can't pick my shoes
We hitting the club, she pick and choose
Diamonds flash, take a pic of you
Talking pounds, we done hit a few
I was down, had to hit the booth
Fuck niggas can't fit in my shoes

[Hook: Jay Critch]
I hit the plug, what you got for me
I ran off with the knots on me
I feel like I need a chop on me
I feel like somebody watching me
I hit the plug, what you got for me
I ran off with the knots on me
I feel like I need a chop on me
I feel like somebody watching me
Tell him so long, I remember you, you was doubting
Money so long, now I stack it up to the mountain
I'm like hold on, I just put my wrist in the fountain
Money grow long [?] like I play for the Falcons

[Verse 2: Damii]
I chase a check, Nike should pay me
They say [?] run it up, they don't catch you lazy
He say he get the bucks, but I make him pay me
Extortion run in our blood, since a lil baby
They watching me stack it up, I see why they hate me
We too far just match it up, back then I was crazy
These bitches still acting up, and never amaze me
Fake niggas they acting tough, I don't let it phase me
These niggas know what's up, Talk Money I call your bluff
Healthy pockets full of veggie stuff
My ones and twos, I ain't making off
Need the loot, tried to double up
Breaking news, we dangerous
[?] harden us
Finish you, he starting off

[Hook: Jay Critch]
I hit the plug, what you got for me
I ran off with the knots on me
I feel like I need a chop on me
I feel like somebody watching me
I hit the plug, what you got for me
I ran off with the knots on me
I feel like I need a chop on me
I feel like somebody watching me
Tell him so long, I remember you, you was doubting
Money so long, now I stack it up to the mountain
I'm like hold on, I just put my wrist in the fountain
Money grow long [?] like I play for the Falcons
