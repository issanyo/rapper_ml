[Verse 1]
Hey!
The bag came from the mud (mud)
Fuck that nigga, he a scrub (scrub)
You ain't ballin', call a sub (sub)
I remember sellin' dubs
I'ma go and pour it up (hey!)
She got lost in my cup (cup)
Smokin' cookie, you can smell it, the way I'm winnin' I think they gettin' jealous (they gettin' jealous)
I know some niggas that's felons, I did a lot but I never would tell it (never would tell it)
Good drugs like a medic, I dozed off, gettin' high up to heaven (high up to heaven)
Talkin' money cause we got it (got it)
All we wanted was the profit (profit)

[Chorus]
He got the pack, we gon' rob it (jug)
Give it back to the hood like Robin (Robin)
I'm doin' good, they can't stop it (stop it)
My pockets full from the options (options)
Pinky ring swing like it's boxin' (hey!)
Get the chicken, extra toppings (toppings)
If she keep bitchin', I'ma block it (I'ma block it)
Niggas switchin' but we solid (30)
I put that hoe on the shelf, if she ain't fuckin' I'ma tell her forget it (tell her forget it)
I did this shit by myself, wassup with all these niggas askin' for credit (why you askin' for credit?)
I asked some niggas for help, they ain't have it, they ain't give me no credit (give me no credit)
Now I got water, Michael Phelps, 'lotta digits when I check out the debit

[Verse 2]
Came to the spot, made a movie scene (movie scene)
Shit on my wrist like 2 degrees (2 degrees)
Fuck all that ice, you ain't cool as me (cool as me)
These bitches bad, need two or three (two or three)
I get a bag then two and three (two and three)
Poppin' a tag in Louis V (Louis V)
I had a pack in my Nudie jeans (Nudie jeans)
Just came back from overseas (overseas)
And I'm scorin' so she holdin' D (hey!)
Niggas snorin', better go get some cheese (go get some cheese)
Touch down and I'm lookin' for freaks
Money come around, gettin' more every week
Good loud, get it straight out the P
Hearin' sounds when I'm smokin' my weed (hey)
LA cookie but I'm way on the east
Pockets healthy and they havin' a feast
Takin' it slow but I'm stayin' on go, niggas won't come up on me (niggas won't come up on me)
Most of these bitches be actin' like hoes but that's what a bitch goin' to be (that's what a bitch goin' to be, hoe)
I put my left wrist on snow, right hand on the beach (right hand on the beach, woah)
Stack it like Tetris, get the dough, count it up with the team (count it up with the team, whoa)

[Chorus]
He got the pack, we gon' rob it (jug)
Give it back to the hood like Robin (Robin)
I'm doing good, they can't stop it (stop it)
My pockets full from the options (options)
Pinky ring swing like it's boxin' (hey!)
Get the chicken, extra toppings (toppings)
If she keep bitchin', I'ma block it (I'ma block it)
Niggas switchin' but we solid (30)
I put that hoe on the shelf, if she ain't fuckin' I'ma tell her forget it (tell her forget it)
I did this shit by myself, wassup with all these niggas askin' for credit (why you asking for credit?)
I asked some niggas for help, they ain't have it, they ain't give me no credit (give me no credit)
Now I got water, Michael Phelps, 'lotta digits when I check out the debit
