Jay Critch hood fave
Hey
Ayy, Talk Money Gang (Ayy, talkin' money, they don't want no convo)
Rich Forever way
Steady
(Hey!)

[Hook]
Talkin' money, they don't want no convo
And I need me the mansion, no condo
And I stay with that dime like Rondo
Bitch, you know I'ma ball like Lonzo
I was smokin' the cookie in fonto
And I need it right now, like pronto
Some of my niggas came out the pot though
In a foreign, too low for the pothole
Oh, you talkin' bout bands, we got those
All this cheese in my hands, that's nacho
Stay with the fan, the block gettin' hot though
Pull up and blam, we knock out your taco
Catch a shell for that green like a taco
Niggas beefin' for cheese we got though
And I'm sippin' on lean, not Ciroc though
And I'm whippin' that V out the lot though

[Verse]
Hood fave gotta flex on a bitch
I need ice on my neck and my wrist
Pray for blessings, 'member I ain't have shit
David Beckham, chopper came with a kick
Save the extras, get the crib and a whip
Stack my money, then I'm making it flip
She be eatin', had to give her a bib
Shawty fiendin' just to swallow my kids
And life ain't the same since that money came
I went through the pain, it got me some chains
Got cake like a B-day, I'm switchin' lanes
I'm ballin' like EA, get in the game
I'm chasin' the guap, they chasin' fame
Can't come in the spot, you ain't the gang
And we sendin' the shot, you tryna play
I flooded the rocks inside the chain

[Hook]
Talkin' money, they don't want no convo
And I need me the mansion, no condo
And I stay with that dime like Rondo
Bitch, you know I'ma ball like Lonzo
I was smokin' the cookie in fonto
And I need it right now, like pronto
Some of my niggas came out the pot though
In a foreign, too low for the pothole
Oh, you talkin' bout bands, we got those
All this cheese in my hands, that's nacho
Stay with the fan, the block gettin' hot though
Pull up and blam, we knock out your taco
Catch a shell for that green like a taco
Niggas beefin' for cheese we got though
And I'm sippin' on lean, not Ciroc though
And I'm whippin' that V out the lot though
