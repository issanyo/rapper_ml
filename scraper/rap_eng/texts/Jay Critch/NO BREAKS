[Hook]
No breaks, no tears, no lies, no fear
Watch out, stay clear, make way, I'm here
I cannot fold under pressure
Niggas be soft like leather
Don't wanna hear no lecture
I already know I'm better
I already know I'm fresher
If I don't really like that weather
Hop on a flight wherever
Whenever, whatever, I'm clever

[Bridge]
Don't try to sleep on me
Girl don't cheat on me
Tryna live peacefully
I need a jesus piece
Can't never trust police
They don't wanna see me free
They don't wanna see me eat
Wanna see me chase that cheese

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
I remember getting chased by the D's
What she know about dem streets?
They was fronting they was doubting me
Air it out like the balcony
We was jugging for the green
Then I wake up in the middle with dreams
I put momma love with some lean
Spend some commas up on my jeans
Hit the pedal now I'm going way fast
Smoke gelato and I'm dumbing the ashes
Got a hood bitch bad I got actress
Bag heavy hid the bag in the mattress
I be scoring and I don't wanna pass it
You said "he spending a bag", fantastic
I heard you ain't getting bag, you tragic
You was balling in the past like Magic

[Hook]
No breaks, no tears, no lies, no fear
Watch out, stay clear, make way, I'm here
I cannot fold under pressure
Niggas be soft like leather
Don't wanna hear no lecture
I already know I'm better
I already know I'm fresher
If I don't really like that weather
Hop on a flight wherever
Whenever, whatever, I'm clever

[Verse 2]
We was at 568, talking big on the stove
Now we out in L.A, riding round in dem coupes
You wouldn't understand
Talking bout way before Did It Again
Yeah it's crazy how time changed
In a whole different mind frame
Advil for the migraine
I'm done with the mind games
Life got me on a blind date
Looking both ways down the oneway
Hall ways, dice games
Got me looking at em side ways
Had to see em through the fine-grain
Taking off like it's Friday

[Hook]
No breaks, no tears, no lies, no fear
Watch out, stay clear, make way, I'm here
I cannot fold under pressure
Niggas be soft like leather
Don't wanna hear no lecture
I already know I'm better
I already know I'm fresher
If I don't really like that weather
Hop on a flight wherever
Whenever, whatever, I'm clever
