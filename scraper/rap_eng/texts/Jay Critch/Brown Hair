[Chorus]
Bad shawty with the brown hair
Never seen you around here
Money stacked in a pile, yeah
Kill 'em all with a smile, yeah
I keep some real niggas around, yeah
My weed so loud, it make a sound, yeah
Steal their money, they don't make a sound, yeah
Had to move up, we was down, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't do no waitin'
Penthouse just for the vacation
This a long way from the basement
I spend all day money making
I'ma tell her
I don't do no datin'
Strokin', don't think she can take it
Fell in love when she got naked
Soon as I'm done, pass her off, you can take it
Fuck is you doing? I'm making them payments
Balling like Crawford, I'm shaking and baking
Play for the Knicks but I'm on my LA shit
Ounce of Gelato, tryna see where that drank is
My bitch a model, came off the front pages
She wanna suck, and swallow, and taste it
I'm in the club, drinks by the cases
Money go up, the foreign keep racing

[Chorus]
Bad shawty with the brown hair
Never seen you around here
Money stacked in a pile, yeah
Kill 'em all with a smile, yeah
I keep some real niggas around, yeah
My weed so loud, it make a sound, yeah
Steal their money, they don't make a sound, yeah
Had to move up, we was down, yeah

[Verse 2]
Ayy, where the checks leanin' now, boy?
Make it flip, make it count, boy
I'm the shit, run the town, boy
You a it, you a clown, boy
She said come here nigga, you been a bad boy
All of these hundreds can't fit in the bag, boy
She know I pick up the racks, I'm a bag boy
Young nigga ballin' and I break the backboard
You ain't do nothin' for me, ain't shit you can ask for
Roll up the cookie, get high like a passport
She gave me pussy, I ain't even ask for it
Diamonds they bitin', I'm whippin' the Jaguar
They copying the wave but that ain't it
Used to go and hit the juggs in the same 'fit
I put on for the hood, yeah I made it
Livin' good, niggas came from the pavement
You was balling before, but you got traded
You don't got it no more, you overrated
Keep the family with me, I wouldn't trade it
I got plans to get richer and be the greatest
These niggas save it

[Chorus]
Bad shawty with the brown hair
Never seen you around here
Money stacked in a pile, yeah
Kill 'em all with a smile, yeah
I keep some real niggas around, yeah
My weed so loud, it make a sound, yeah
Steal their money, they don't make a sound, yeah
Had to move up, we was down, yeah
