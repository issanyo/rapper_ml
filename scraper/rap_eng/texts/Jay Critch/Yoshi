[Hook]
Hey, gettin' the green like Yoshi
Gettin' the green like groceries, stay the same that's what my momma told me
She know the name thats why she wanna blow me
Nigga feel the pain thats why real niggas know me
When she see the chain she gon' bust it wide open
First pint told her bust it wide open
Fresh purse, these niggas is joking
Ever since I got it, shawty act like she know me
I'm balling in Fairfax like i'm Kobe
Rockin' the Airmax like it's '03
Stay the same that's what my momma told me
Stay high now I got her wide open
AI bitch I'm always wide open
I'm ballin' and niggas stayin on that broke shit

[Verse]
These niggas stay hatin on that broke shit
Say he gettin cake but he bogus
Nigga you ain't ready you ain't focused
Remember when I was on the wave, posted
Got yo bitch givin me face, chokin'
These niggas broke and I ain't, jokin
Smokin' a blunt of the dank, potent
Say you a shooter you ain't, totin
Lotta checks but no Nike on me
Hi-Tech pour up a cream soda
Get rich money pickin the phone up
Thick bitch I'mma give her the cobra
Aye, they was sleepin on me, now they up in the mornin'
Aye, she be eatin but she doesn't freak I don't want it
