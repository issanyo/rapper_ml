[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
She want a nigga who ballin'
I get the money, you salty
Tell them lil' haters get off me
Lean in the mornin' like coffee
Got the check
Gotta flex
I just dropped a grip on my neck
She want a nigga who ballin'
I get the money you salty
Tell them lil' haters get off me
Lean in the mornin' like coffee
Got the check
Gotta flex
I just dropped a grip on my neck

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Baby this shit is too easy
I get the money, believe me
These niggas can't see me like Stevie
I had to New Freezer my AP
You a broke boy
Can't catch a hoe boy
Oh no boy, she ain't fucking with no poor boy
Now I'm on top
You hatin' I'm winnin' I cannot stop
These chips keep on coming like get the drop
I made it from nothin' I got the guap
Rich nigga, run from 12, jump the fence nigga
Can't switch nigga, you a groupie, take a pic nigga
She want a nigga who ballin'
You gotta watch from the sideline
Check out the watch, it's my time
These real V's, you go blind
I got a check
I gotta flex
I made it from nothin', I cannot stress
I got me a coupe, I just want the jet

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
She want a nigga who ballin'
I get the money, you salty
Tell them lil' haters get off me
Lean in the mornin' like coffee
Got the check
Gotta flex
I just dropped a grip on my neck
She want a nigga who ballin'
I get the money you salty
Tell them lil' haters get off me
Lean in the mornin' like coffee
Got the check
Gotta flex
I just dropped a grip on my neck

[Verse 2: Jay Critch]
I'm all in her mouth, I'm flossin
I'm loving the doubt, it's awesome
These niggas hatin' but that shit gon' cost em'
Taking they bitches and turn them to bosses
I go on shopping sprees, often
Cause I get to the green, Boston
Cup dirty in the shower, fucking for hours, I got the powers, Austin
I'm nothin like you, you had the juice, ya lost it
Sippin' the juice, them hunnids ain't blue, you lost 'em
I was skippin' school, tryna get to, the profit
They hate, thinking it's cool, stop it
Hood Fav, the trending topic
But I get to the rackies now
Diamonds on me, start punchin' like Pacquiao
She want me to smash it now
I'ma hit it, dip, now that bitch actin' out
I need a mansion with a 10 car garage, foreigns backin' out
Ya diamonds ain't dancin, that ice too dusty bring the vacuum out

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
She want a nigga who ballin'
I get the money, you salty
Tell them lil' haters get off me
Lean in the mornin' like coffee
Got the check
Gotta flex
I just dropped a grip on my neck
She want a nigga who ballin'
I get the money you salty
Tell them lil' haters get off me
Lean in the mornin' like coffee
Got the check
Gotta flex
I just dropped a grip on my neck
