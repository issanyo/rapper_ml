[Hook]
So much money man, don't know the difference
All of my niggas gone get it
Talk money, we done get it our way
Never ever do no switching
All these niggas man they acting like bitches
I got to run to the digits
All of my shooters they came in with it
And they never do no missing
So much money man, don't know the difference
All of my niggas gone get it
Talk money we done get it our way
Never ever do no switching
All these niggas man they acting like bitches
I got to run to the digits
All of my niggas man they fuck with the pot
Never ever do no dishes

[Verse 1]
Nigga I had to get me some digits
Where that money go I follow
Sometimes I smoke me a pack of that cookie
Sometimes I smoke that Gelato
Some of my niggas they came out the kitchen
My shit [?]
I know that girl, she use to be stripping
Why she tryna act like a model
40 pass me that act in a bottle
Fendi on me dont want Ferragamo
Imma pull up in that Murcielago
Imma pull up and she gonna swallow
Bitch im a on way, [?]
I just got me a bag, I'm like Bravo
I was broke, now I got me a lot tho
Rolling dope going straight to the top tho

[Hook]
So much money man, don't know the difference
All of my niggas gone get it
Talk money, we done get it our way
Never ever do no switching
All these niggas man they acting like bitches
I got to run to the digits
All of my shooters they came in with it
And they never do no missing
So much money man, don't know the difference
All of my niggas gone get it
Talk money we done get it our way
Never ever do no switching
All these niggas man they acting like bitches
I got to run to the digits
All of my niggas man they fuck with the pot
Never ever do no dishes

[Verse 2]
Fuck your bitch like [?]
I'm hard like a beetle
I'm tryna get this money for my people
Niggas be lying, I cannot believe you
Steady deceitful
Got to blinking and I'm thinking you evil
I'm rocking that [?]
Smoking that gas, I'm smoking that diesel
Talking that money, I'm selling that legal
All of these niggas they see through
Got to get right to the rack
It's get that work and end up taxing
See the money got to grab it, stack it
Fucking your bitch on the mattress
Shorty wetter than a fountain
Money taller than a mountain
Niggas be doubting
Use to be getting allowance
All in the pussy i'm drowning
Money be counting, smoking the gases
I'm hiding

[Hook]
So much money man, don't know the difference
All of my niggas gone get it
Talk money, we done get it our way
Never ever do no switching
All these niggas man they acting like bitches
I got to run to the digits
All of my shooters they came in with it
And they never do no missing
So much money man, don't know the difference
All of my niggas gone get it
Talk money we done get it our way
Never ever do no switching
All these niggas man they acting like bitches
I got to run to the digits
All of my niggas man they fuck with the pot
Never ever do no dishes
