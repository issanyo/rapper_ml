Got it on smash

Went from my toes, look like bricks when I walk (huh)

Grip on her waist when I take her down (take her down)

Pass to the gang, that's a play around (play around)
Only need Yaz just to lay it down (lay it down)
Foot on the gas, I'm not breakin' now (breakin' now)

I can't love her, I think out the box (think out the box)
In the Air Max, that's the dope runners (dope runners)
Phone ringin', got some dope comin' (dope coming)

If she bad and broke, I don't want her (I don't want her)
Jumpin' in the Hellcat, hit the lane switch
Used to dream of this shit in the basement (in the basement)
Some of my niggas fightin' them cases (thirty)
When I fuck up a check, I replace it (replace it)
And the hood sayin' I'm they favorite (hood fave)
