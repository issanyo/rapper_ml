[Intro]
Hey!
Jay Critch hood fave
Stupid
Loui-Louis, you nasty
Talk Money gang
Hey!

[Hook]
I'm mixin' up the designer
Fuckin' your bitch, can't find her
I put the gang in the diamonds
I get it fast like McDonalds
I'm sippin' lean for my energy
Try and be the boss, you could never be
Fake friends, they turn into enemies
I gotta pour up the Hennessy
I gotta roll up the Jattic
Niggas mad, but they don't want no static
Steve Nash, boy you ballin' like Dragic
New bag, blew it all on my fabric
I need the Bentley truck
Where you at, on my way to the bucks
She in her feelings, I ain't givin' a fuck
Run up on me, boy you tryin' your luck

[Verse 1]
Ayy, lotta choppers, nigga you better duck
And I'm ballin', wit' a lotta ice, like I went with the puck
And she callin', but that bitch is dumb, said she fallin' in love
You niggas is stallin', I was gettin' to it, now I'm countin' it up
I need a Range no Infiniti
I seen that little bitch into me
My money go to infinity
Gucci on me, it's from Italy
I mix the Gucci with Louis V
That money told me that she true to me
I got that money, now she chewin' me
I got the Balmains from the [?] jeans

[Hook]
I'm mixin' up the designer
Fuckin' your bitch, can't find her
I put the gang in the diamonds
I get it fast like McDonalds
I'm sippin' lean for my energy
Try and be the boss, you could never be
Fake friends, they turn into enemies
I gotta pour up the Hennessy
I gotta roll up the Jattic
Niggas mad, but they don't want no static
Steve Nash, boy you ballin' like Dragic
New bag, blew it all on my fabric
I need the Bentley truck
Where you at, on my way to the bucks
She in her feelings, I ain't givin' a fuck
Run up on me, boy you tryin' your luck

[Verse 2]
Pull up in a Ghost
It ain't funny, broke is a joke
Water on me, that chain on me float
She all in my face, she doin' the most
Smoke out the O
If it's smoke, my niggas on go
I hit a jugg, like 3 in a row
I'm in the hood with 730
Hood fave, had a good day, bitch I'm gettin' the dough
[?], had to switch lanes, now I put on a show
Need a new Wraith, fuck an I8, can't [?] a ho
Get some cake, see a new face, niggas actin' like bros

[Hook]
I'm mixin' up the designer
Fuckin' your bitch, can't find her
I put the gang in the diamonds
I get it fast like McDonalds
I'm sippin' lean for my energy
Try and be the boss, you could never be
Fake friends, they turn into enemies
I gotta pour up the Hennessy
I gotta roll up the Jattic
Niggas mad, but they don't want no static
Steve Nash, boy you ballin' like Dragic
New bag, blew it all on my fabric

Where you at, on my way to the bucks
She in her feelings, I ain't givin' a fuck
Run up on me, boy you tryin' your luck
