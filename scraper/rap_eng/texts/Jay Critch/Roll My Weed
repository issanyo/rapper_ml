[Intro: Don Q]
Yeah
She gon' roll my weed and she gon' pour me up
Valet, where my key? Nigga don't hold me up

[Chorus: Don Q]
She gon' roll my weed (yeah), she gon' pour me up (yeah)
Valet where my key? (yeah) Please don't hold me up (yeah)
All I know is speed (yeah), bitch tryna slow me up (yeah)
I'm goin' overseas, call a PJ and come load me up (yeah)

[Verse 1: Don Q]
I know she love the demeanor (yeah), I blew a dub when I seen her (yeah)
I know these bitches be runnin' game, so I know what's up when I meet 'em (yeah)
Young nigga I used to jump the train
And we used to pump by the cleaners (yeah)
My dream was to get me 100 chains, and pull up and jump out of beamers (yeah, uh)
Look at the stats, we the ones that put the hood on the map (yeah)
Most of you couldn't adapt, we started the label and built it from scratch
They sit and wait for the hood to collapse
That's on my waist got it fully attached (fully attached)
Aim at his face watch his hoodie detach
If one of our names get put in a rap, nigga

[Chorus: Don Q]
She gon' roll my weed (yeah), she gon' pour me up (yeah)
Valet, where my key? (yeah), please don't hold me up (yeah)
All I know is speed (yeah), bitch tryna slow me up  (yeah)
I'm goin' overseas, call a PJ and come load me up (yeah)

[Verse 2: Jay Critch]
Yo Don
There's way too much cash in the room
Call the Brinks truck and tell them to load it up
I been scorin', that's a hole-in-one
With the jewelry on, a nigga cold as fuck
I was inside of the Bentley truck, I was rollin' up and they notice us
She keeps on tryna hop in with us and she wanna cup, so I poured it up
You ain't gettin' money, you slow as fuck
You should just give up just tell 'em forget it
My wrist is the X Games, diamonds they shredded
And she got a head start, she can go sleddin'
How you had a head start still got no credit?
The first thing I learned in the hood was to get it
With spikes on it, bottom's red like spaghetti
Still be surprised when I look at the debit

[Verse 3: Don Q]
Still be surprised when I look where I'm headed
Fuck a blogger I'm a crook and they read it
Red bottoms got me hooked, it's a fetish
They know who poppin', they just couldn't accept it
My hood ain't neglected, they know where we at
You plannin' on slidin', I wouldn't suggest it
The homies was sayin' I shouldn't address it
The police watchin' but couldn't connect it

[Chorus: Don Q]
She gon' roll my weed (yeah), she gon' pour me up (yeah)
Valet, where my key? (yeah) Please don't hold me up (yeah)
All I know is speed (yeah), bitch tryna slow me up (yeah)
I'm goin' overseas, call a PJ and come load me up (yeah)
