Stay posted up like Carmelo
My niggas came out the ghetto
Streets heatin' up like a kettle
You know how we rock heavy metal
Fuck that bitch in her Stiletto's
Money build up like it's Lego
Syrup pour up like it's Eggo
Free Melo
Niggas snitchin’ they talk to the Devil
Red bottoms like I walk with the Devil
Hit a stain then we step on the pedal
Audi rings like Olympic gold medals
Pour up the lean watch it settle
Fuck her then cross off my schedule
Pass her monkey in the middle
Ima pass her monkey in the middle
Free the gaza
Stay low on the block and get higher
Ask around that boy Critch on fire
My bitch wasted like my tires
Aye why niggas talkin' to police
Aye why your girl act like she know me
Like why I be ballin' like Kobe
I need a stain I can't get no sleep
Boy you don't be posted on no street
I been outside since like '03
She pull up and give me that dome piece
Place a hit, put some bread on yah dome piece
She keep callin' won't let my phone breathe
Ima step in Europe like Ginobili
All my niggas like me I ain't doely
Can't forget what a real nigga told me
Bitch I done hit some licks on my doely
Hit a lick now this bitch wanna bone me
That lil bitch think that pussy control me
Hit it and quit now she sayin' I'm phony
In my hood we got choppas like Zone 3
In my hood know the D's they be on me
I guess cause I'm up now they know me
Young nigga move like an OG
