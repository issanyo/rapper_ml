[Intro]
What you mean, lil baby what you mean

[Chrous: TME Nana]
What you mean, lil baby what you mean
I've been living in a fairy tale and shit ain't what it seems
I can stack my money high, baby all my money clean
And i heard you have a man but i had to intervene like
What's yo name, lil baby whats yo name
I got stripes like I'm a ref and I'm used to running game
I can take you round the world so lil baby why you playing
And she know I got a girl but my bad is but she lame but its
Okay i swear its okay
Cause tonight I'm in the city and my girl out in la
And lil baby I'm a baller so you know i came to play
And i hope you're not a staller cause i plan to hit today like

[Verse 1: TME Nana]
Come here lil bitch (uh uh)
Come here lemme show you some (uh)
Move with a grip (uh uh)
Move with a loaded gun
Ice on my wrist
Call it a snow or some
Hop in the whip
Baby im going numb
Get on the guap
Look at the love baby im going numb
I see a pack
Dont know how to act
Baby im taking some
{?}
She eatin my meat
Like its a steak or sum
Shorty she thick
I think she a freak
Wet like a lake or some
How could you ever regret me
All of this ice like a gretzky
If you want smoke come and test me
You spill this Glock it get messy
None of you niggas impress me
Glizzy on me it protect me

[Chorus: TME Nana]
What you mean lil baby what you mean
Ive been living in a fairytale and shit ain't what it seems
I can stack my money high baby all my money clean
And i heard you have a man but i had to intervene like
Whats your name lil baby whats your name
I got stripes like im a ref and im used to running game
I can take you round the world so lil baby why you playing
And she know i got a girl but my bad is but she lame but its
Okay i swear its okay
Cause tonight im in the city and my girl out in la
And lil baby im a baller so you know i came to play
And i hope youre not a staller cause i plan to hit today like

[Verse 2: Jay Critch]
I do that digital dash up in the whip like it got stole or sum
I throw that hoe in the trash cause she keep bitching and blowing my phone up
I left her right in the past when i got on cause i got my dough up
I was just going so fast look at the meter that niggas say donuts
Came out the trenches
I got brothers fuck a frienship
Your bitch giving my dick a french kiss
Cause im balling im not on the benches
You better watch who you mention
My 30s pull up and they end shit
My nigga flexing like im benching
That bitch wanna fuck my necklace
So im like
Come here lil bitch
Gimme the dome or sum
That boy a snitch
You know he told her sum
My diamonds a glitch
Look they froze or sum
Run down with that clip
That nigga frozen up
Boy you a actor
Swear these niggas live in back woods
Roll a cookie in a backwood
Hit the pedal going faster
Shawty give me brain i ain't ask her
Shawty entertain all the rappers
But that bitch a lame she trash
Hop in the wrait where the cash at
