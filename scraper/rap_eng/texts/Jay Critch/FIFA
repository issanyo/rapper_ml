Aye, she on the side cause my main bitch a keeper
She just wanna kick it but I'm a goalkeeper
Hey 30, gang in this bitch, yeah, yeah

Chorus: Jay Critch
She on the side cause my main bitch a keeper
She said she want me, but I cannot keep her
Wanna kick it like Fifa, no I'm a goalkeeper
I block that little bitch, shot to the bleachers
Follow her on Instagram after I met her, block her on Instagram after I leave her
Heat on my hip and give me a fever
This heat on my hip and it give me a fever
[?] diamonds they cool me down, double cups just to cool me down
That's your woman she a groupie now, that's your woman she a groupie now
But don't get smoked like a loosie
Leave a nigga in the lost and found
Hoes go, hoes come around
Money go, money come around

We hate police, they keep killing my people
Niggas recording, they watching like Regal
