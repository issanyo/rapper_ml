[Intro: Madwiz & (Jay Critch)]
Yo!
Alright kids you ready for bed?
I'm going to tell you a story
It's the story of Clinton Hill
(Hey!)
Stupid

[Verse 1: Madwiz]
F is for friends who do shit together
Like governments niggas fucking up the weather
U is for you and me shooting it out
Niggas get creased like scalps
And we so smart for the slang that we started
Just give me the [?]
38 ain't nothing but a number
Take a trip to my land of wonder

[Verse 2: Jay Critch]
Out the hoodie get hot in the summer
On the wave
Diamonds beating like drummer
Get the cash in
New bag I need all of that
Madwiz, that's my brother before the rap
Pack fits
Ship it out we go order that
And we taxin'
Niggas finessin' for real
I'm drinkin' I feel like the King of the Hill
In the whip
It's me, Bundy, Fifty, and Millz

[Verse 3: Madwiz]
Lick my niggas in coerce
We wish you the best
But i'm the worst
Cop the henny
Then the Murc(ielago)
Charging 2 million for a verse
Bitch you ain't even got japanese money
You fronted and that's the last you ever seen from me
Realized you [?] fiend from me
You can keep my shoes clean for me

[Verse 4: Jay Critch]
I'm ballin', whatchu mean dummy bad bitch?
Tell her count the green for me, cabbage
Know I got the green on me
Living lavish
Valet park it vie for me
Stupid
I'm from BK
Everywhere that I go imma represent
And we blessed
This weed that i'm smoking is heaven sent
Never stress
I need me a billion, ain't get it yet

[Verse 5: Madwiz]
Stupid(x4)
Rich the Kid up in [?]
Getting cheeseburgers chopped up
Stupid(x4)
In the hood who's your favorite?
Is it Madwiz or Jay Critch?
And try not to speak my name
Like Chris Benoit
But let me explain
Wiz and your [?]
I can't fly
Niggas is out of my range, in this game
And i stay forever
Shakes and pepper 'fore I break a record
Stay connected with my Haitian sector
Move you, I'm a high stepper
Wizard's world bitch

[Verse 6: Jay Critch]
You know me and my niggas stay together
Hood fave, but i'm Jay forever
Little nigga, but I was by them OGs
With a gang
Win her ass like a trophy
I'm in dubs
Rolling dice with the homies
She a dubb
That bitch act like she know me
Fill the tub
Got the water all on me
And i'm coming up
Middle fingers to the police

[Verse 7: Madwiz]
I don't think nothing of it
Just dipped out of publics
Nothing but snacks in my luggage
I heard your new shit and it's rubbish
Ain't no slippin' force
We the authors
Catch a sound bombin' with the ruckus
In the spot looking morbid
Take a pill of the kush and absorb it

[Verse 8: Jay Critch]
Learned a lot in the hood
I absorbed it
To the top
Need a spot in the Forbes list
Purple cup
Like i'm telling a fortune
Come and work for us
Turn my niggas to bosses
And you had the juice but you lost it
New bag
Good day at the office
I'm with Juice
All my niggas they flossin'
Diamonds move
Got your shawty all nauseous

[Verse 9: Madwiz]
Stupid(x4)
I get the chicken from [?]
You niggas is looking real dumb now
Stupid(x4)
Now we just having a field day
Hill on my side
We call it the hills way
Dab, Datway

[Verse 10: Jay Critch]
I'm smoking jattic on Biggie' block
Diamonds on me do the milly rock
No, we ain't talking to any cops
Watch how you walk and they sending shots
Put the hood on the map
Fuck a next up
Put the hood on my back
No pressure
And I walk around the hills with the extras
Hit a jug
Put your trap on a stretcher

[Verse 11: Madwiz]
Black jag
Up in the spot with a black wag
Getting that money's the last laugh
Smoking jattic I don't pass that
Check it out
Jet magazine shit
Agony come mack with me and shit
Last seen with the fit
Mad muthafucking Wiz

[Verse 12: Jay Critch]
I was on the ave with the nicks
Barclay's pull up with the tips
Ball gang
Ballin' like the Knicks
All day
Dreaming 'bout the chips
She can fuck me
But can't get no tips
That hoe let me bust it
I'm all in her ribs
Boss up my life
Had to handle my biz
Remember the nights
We was runnin' from pigs

[Verse 13: Madwiz]
And you ain't never been on Waverly
So none of y'all niggas as brave as me
Murder lab, me and Juice bang
And Foot was street 730 gang
Together
Madwiz forever, Critch forever
Peace to Rich Forever
Shit we spit so get your shit together
Don't fuck with us unless your wrist is better

[Outro: Madwiz]
Stupid
Shittin' me?
Stupid
Damn, uh
