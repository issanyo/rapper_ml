[Hook: Jay Critch]
Tell her pop out to da pull up
Tell her pop out to da pull up
Tell her pop out to da pull up
I might go pull up on shawty
I might go pull up on shawty
I might go pull up on shawty
I might go pull up on shawty
I might jump outta the 'Rari
Tell her pop out to da pull up
Tell her pop out to da pull up
Tell her pop out to da pull up
I might go pull up on shawty
I might go pull up on shawty
I might go pull up on shawty
I might go pull up on shawty
I might jump outta the 'Rari

[Verse: Jay Critch]
Tell her pop out to da pull up
This year like pull up
And I ball Chauncey Billups
Big shots, you can't hit us
Tell her pull up to the function
My niggas smokin' that strong shit
My niggas juggin' them onions
My niggas shoot no discussion
Real front niggas is drummin'
When its drama time you can't be runnin'
I went down so I had to start juggin'
Hittin' licks till I make it
Ain't go down for the shit I was doin'
No face, no case shit
So I only went far as the [?]
I thank god everyday
But thats enough about me
Thinkin' that she my new favorite
Shawty anything but basic
Girl you ain't stupid, but that cake is
Put Burberry on my main shit
Burberry be a fragrance
Burberry around my waist
Bitches know they can't replace it
Wear Laurent in the basement
Wear Laurent on the stages
Now shawty wanna a conversation
Told her I don't do no dating
But my shawty flexing like pull-ups
Baby pop out to da pull up
Pour you a cup of that good stuff
The Hennessy give me good love

[Hook: Jay Critch]
Tell her pop out to da pull up
Tell her pop out to da pull up
Tell her pop out to da pull up
I might go pull up on shawty
I might go pull up on shawty
I might go pull up on shawty
I might go pull up on shawty
I might jump outta the 'Rari
Tell her pop out to da pull up
Tell her pop out to da pull up
Tell her pop out to da pull up
I might go pull up on shawty
I might go pull up on shawty
I might go pull up on shawty
I might go pull up on shawty
I might jump outta the 'Rari
