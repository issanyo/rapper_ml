[Chorus]
I pick up the figures, go home, and come right back
Flooded every finger, every stone is an ice cap
Diamonds on me swingin' and they hittin' and they fight back
When you get the chicken they be switchin', it's just like that
Ayy, I been on a mission and she like that
I just spent an hour in the club and made a light bag
I just pull up in that Bentley truck and got 'em tight, mad
I ain't even really wanna fuck her but she type bad
I ain't even wanna hit
I'ma get a new ho, right back on my Smutty shit
Walkin' with the blue notes, bitch I got a ton of it
I'm talkin' 'bout new dough, they're not hearin' none of it

[Verse 1]
I pick up the phone, call up the dawgs and put the hounds on you
We not pullin' up unless you got more than a pound on you
We ain't tryna re-up, niggas runnin' down on you
When you start to move up, they start talkin' down on you
I'm like fuck it, that shit cool though
I just got a new check, walkin' with the blue notes
Before I had a blue check I was fuckin' new hoes
She think that she wifey but I don't really do those
When I'm pullin' off I gotta floss up in the two door
Had to turn myself into the boss like it's Hugo
I don't even want her 'less the cause got a few O's
I know shawty want it, breakin' bitches like it's sumo

[Chorus]
I pick up the figures, go home, and come right back
Flooded every finger, every stone is an ice cap
Diamonds on me swingin' and they hittin' and they fight back
When you get the chicken they be switchin', it's just like that
Ayy, I been on a mission and she like that
I just spent an hour in the club and made a light bag
I just pull up in that Bentley truck and got 'em tight, mad
I ain't even really wanna fuck her but she type bad
I ain't even wanna hit
I'ma get a new ho, right back on my Smutty shit
Walkin' with the blue notes, bitch I got a ton of it
I'm talkin' 'bout new dough, they're not hearin' none of it

[Verse 2]
Hood fave, had to level up
I made all these racks in one day, wake the bezel up
No key, I just press a button, engine revvin' up
Lowkey they don't want no problems, boy don't press your luck
I'ma break her heart, baby I'm the top Smut (Top Smutty)
All these bitches eatin' like the fuckin' potluck
She gon' pop the pussy, bankroll, pop the clutch
He be poppin' shit, smoke a nigga like a dutch
But I be smokin' pounds of gelato out the Backwoods
That nigga ain't really from the streets, he just act hood
My niggas gon' run off on the plug if the pack good
If I'm on the block then I'm ballin' just like Shaq would

[Chorus]
I pick up the figures, go home, and come right back
Flooded every finger, every stone is an ice cap
Diamonds on me swingin' and they hittin' and they fight back
When you get the chicken they be switchin', it's just like that
Ayy, I been on a mission and she like that
I just spent an hour in the club and made a light bag
I just pull up in that Bentley truck and got 'em tight, mad
I ain't even really wanna fuck her but she type bad
I ain't even wanna hit
I'ma get a new ho, right back on my Smutty shit
Walkin' with the blue notes, bitch I got a ton of it
I'm talkin' 'bout new dough, they're not hearin' none of it
