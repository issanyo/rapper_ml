[Intro]

(Yo Pierre you wanna come out here ?)

[Chorus: Dotty Dot]

She used to party on a Thursday
Screaming, “Patron don’t hurt me !”
I tell ‘em niggas you the homie
You talk about me in the worst way, uh
How you move like that on me
How you talk like that ‘bout me
How you switchin’ up on me (yeah)
Yeah yeah, uh
But we used to be on the same team
Same team (x3), yeah
We used to be on the same team
Same team (x3) yeah

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]

(Hey !)

I got a bag with the same team
Same team in the foreign racing, (foreign racing, woah woah) ay
I got me some money she hate me
She just mad ‘cause she can’t replace me, (can’t replace me, no no) ay
I’m staying out my wallet I’m a feen
What’s there to talk about
Ima give ‘em what they ask for
New Bentley not a Jaguar, I got some cash, I could have more
(I got some cash, I could have more) ay
I ain’t going outside foreign
Big chopper like the task force
A nigga flyer than a passport
Balmain jeans shit I never could afford
Off this lean so don’t call me anymore
Had a dream they ain’t let me out that court
So I’m agreeing I got nothing for these hoes

[Chorus: Dotty Dot]
