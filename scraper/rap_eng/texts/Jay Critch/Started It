[Hook: Jay Critch]
It's the niggas that copy the wave
Then it's the niggas that started it
I get to the money like everyday
Walk with the hundreds
A lot of it
Some of my niggas was clapping like audience
Now we got an audience
And we want the money
Ain't looking for trouble
But we gon' finish, if you starting it
And these niggas hating
So I keep it glued
Nigga it's just how i move
Can't tell me shit
While you was in school
I was out making a move
Probably tryna hit a stain for the loot
Run it up
We don't follow the rules
I'm in the Bentley
When you see me pulling up
But I'm tryna' get two

[Verse 1: Don Q]
I'm in the trap cooking work up
I'm guzzling act' and I'm perk'd up
I ride 'till my back and the dirt touch
I ride with the strap in the shirt tucked
Main denims i just slang in em'
Killing pain with the pain killers
I make it rain with the gang members
Lame niggas can't hang with us
Get the drop then we on that
Got RJ and the loaded strap
He got two pistols and they both black
Got us speaking codes cause the phone tapped
Fuck it up and get another one
We run it up and get a runner sum
My niggas do not shoot dirty guns
They hit you up and get another one
From now on call me Don Juan
Run up on a nigga you'll be long gone
They came through but we bang too
That was just another mission gone wrong
I had a pack in my long johns
Will not leave till its long gone
Know some killers they all wrong
They shoot up ya house till the walls gone
No molly, but I do the percocets
Back to back, if i don't feel them shits working yet
Mix the Act' with the red call it purple tech
Hit the back of his head with a dirty tech
Spent a stack on my legs yeah I'm worth a check
It's a fact cause we got bread and we earned respect
You ain't see a nigga murdered yet?
Scale in nigga
Show the work correct

[Verse 2: Jay Critch]
I done came up
That money talking
All these broke niggas ain't hearing 'em
Like a lay up
Had to get to the racks
In the hell cat and I'm tearing up
And some of my niggas came up the kitchen
You was in the caferteria
You ain't a real nigga
I heard you was switching
You do not fit the criteria
I had to stack it up
Bust down a medallion
These bitches acting up
But they pockets be frowning
My niggas tryna get out public housing
If you put in work
Why you talking about it?
Cup full of dirt
Like the shit need a shower
Gave her a perk
She'll be fucking for hours
Me and Justo came up
Hitting licks for the sour
Yeah you got a bag?
It ain't nothing like ours
