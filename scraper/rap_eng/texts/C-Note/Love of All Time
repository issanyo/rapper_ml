Baby, everyday I pray for someone like you
And today my prayers came true
Come on baby
Girl just let me say that thinking about you is how I start my day..
Oh girl I love your style
Baby just one look at you drives me wild
And I cherish the moment that we're together cuz you're my everything
We've got the love of all times, of all times
Yes I prayed for someone just like you
We've got the love of all times, of all times
I'm so glad someone like you loves me to
We've got the love of all times
Girl it sets me free
Don't even explain why you're so good to me
No there's nothing they could do
It wouldn't be enough, it wouldn't change my love for you. to come between us
It may sound crazy, but your love saves me
You're my everything
We've got the love of all times, of all times
Yes I prayed for someone just like you
We've got the love of all times, of all times
I'm so glad someone like you loves me to
We've got the love of all times
I know you hurt before, but you won't hurt no more
I swear I won't let you down
I know this love is forever
Shows in everything you do
I'll do anything you want me to
