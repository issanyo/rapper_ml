[Hook: BoBo Swae]
I ball out the lot (lot)
I'm like, look what I got (look what I got)
The pimpin' ain't gon' never stop (I promise, promise)
We takin' this shit to the top (all the way)
What you mean, I got to spazz on 'em? (not again)
Shawty bad, she got an ass on her (she a ten)
Man, I'm 'bout to the hit the club again (yeah)
Pour me up that Ace of Spades and Henn'

[Verse 1: BoBo Swae]
We about to pop a hundred bottles
Let me see who's coming with
Girl, you got the body of a goddess
Got to send you down a gift
I love the way you shake that ass up on that pole
You movin' very swift
You doin' it way too good, a million dollar tip
This what you deserve, million dollar curve
Girl, you got that nerve when I make you swerve
I just wanna go and feel that fuckin' purse
You ain't never had a nigga like this
Work, work, work, work, work

[Hook: BoBo Swae]

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Switch the Phantom to the old school, to the bike, to the Wraith
Bitches say I'm actin' Hollywood but I'm never actin' fake
When you see me better take a picture, it'll last a little longer
Foreign bitch, no souvenirs but a travel bag on her
She said, I got a way with words
We call it showbizz cause they show out on the turf
At the telly smokin', fuckin', don't disturb
My bitch so bad she might could get away with murder

[Hook: BoBo Swae]
I ball out the lot (lot)
I'm like, look what I got (look what I got)
The pimpin' ain't gon' never stop (I promise, promise)

[Verse 3: BoBo Swae]
We caught 'em hatin' from the side but we ain't worried
Man we killin' all this shit, we leave 'em buried
You better come and save the game, I'm in a hurry
I'm 'bout to go and take this shot, bitch, yea I'm Curry
I got my words on words
I'm on a zoot, I'm slurrin
She gotta bust her pussy, yea, I make it purrr
She out her shirt, she out her shirt
A young country nigga got it out the dirt

[Hook: BoBo Swae]
I ball out the lot (lot)
I'm like, look what I got (look what I got)
The pimpin' ain't gon' never stop (I promise, promise)
