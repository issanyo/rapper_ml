[Verse: Broke Ass Rapper]
You 38 and you still rapping uuuh
Boy yo ass dirty as fuck
And you might need a hug
Yo bones creak, and yo bitch ass get stuck
And I don't do no friends
Skrrt Skrrt, fucked yo bitch in a Benz
Yeah all about them bands
Shitting on these niggas well I guess it all depends
It all depends like yo old ass wear
Im surprised that yo old ass here
What happened to yo old ass hair
Aw shit it can't grow right there
You old ass niggas need to stay on tour
You been rapping since 1984
Boy that old shit dont work no more
Don't break yo fucking head when you walk out the door
You 38 and you still rapping ugh
You 38 and you still rapping ugh
You 38 and you still rapping ugh
Yo old ass still wear Birdman Lugz
