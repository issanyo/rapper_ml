[C-Note]
My rims poking out, like a fat ass
Little weight motherfucker, this straight glass
We beating up your block, like some 15's
Video, started playing on my six screens
This ain't Hollywood, nigga this is street dreams
Got to holla at the hood, making street cream
And you know, we like our Benzes and our Cadillacs
We wearing so much bling, we give em cataracts
Down South, Dirty Third
3rd Coast, mayn we got them birds
Get the ring bezeltynes, and you heard
Rolling G five hundred, in Excurs'
Best play, your position
These boys popping trunks, bout to cause a collision
Best make a decision, taking rap to a whole new dimension
24's bout to break the suspension, now nigga have dimension

[Hook - 2x]
You should ride with us, (come on ride with us)
You should ride with us, (come on ride with us)
You should ride with us, (come on ride with us
Niggas getting high with us, do the Southside with us)

Iight I got the urge to strike, some'ing dead in the ass
I'm in the future, y'all stay in the past yeah
Nigga was broke, holding my shoes
Rat funky as the fuck, fools having it too
Same hoes that was talking that shit, done turned groupie
I no longer have holes in my shoes, I rock Gucci
I know, you smell the cologne
You wishing that a nigga of my caliber, was taking you home
Hate to intervene, while I'm making you moan
When I got a little situation at hand, baby I'm gone
My alarm is going off, I know I been trailed
I ain't fucking with her though, both crazy as hell
That's the reason I'm posted up, here on Canal
Hoping you could do me, and my nigga as well
Call your people up, we need a lot of females
Tell em we getting money, like a lottery sale

[Hook - 2x]

[C-Note]
Get down you should ride with us, on blades
I'm creeping up your block, in a burban Escalade
C-Note and Juvenile, and we coming through your city
Looking for the fine girls, with them nice titties
Got a drop in the driveway, rolling through the fly way
Hoping that I don't, spot a cop on the highway
Just a few things, we do on Sunday
Bout to turn MLK, into a one way
Ok, I'm still smoking doja
All my niggas, screaming Cloverland Magnolia
Best to watch your back, cause we coming with them soldiers
Looking for them niggas, who be snitching to them rollers
Get to bombing on niggas, like U.S. did Iraq
Like Bush do the same, man I'm coming that's a fact
I got niggas, every city every state
I'm just saying, ain't a few phone calls I couldn't make what
