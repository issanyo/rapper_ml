Baby come over tonight
I promise baby girl
I'll make it right
Baby come over tonight
I want to be close to you come over
Come over tonight
You're on my heart, and you're on my mind
The way you make me feel I just can't describe
I, I just can't help, but fall in love
You're the only one that I'm thinking of
All I want is you
You're all I need
To give my heart
To give my all
I really want to see you tonight
Baby come over
Baby come over tonight
I promise baby girl I'll make it right
Baby come over tonight
I want to be close to you
Come over, come over tonight
Let's take our time, sit by candlelight
Let the stars, the moon light up at night
I see love shining in your eyes
I want to make sweet love baby
Let me make you mine
All I want is you
You're all I need to give my heart
To give my all
I really want to see you tonight
Baby come over

I promise baby girl

Baby come over tonight
I want to be close to you
Come over come over tonight
