[C-Note]
Now bounce it bounce it, some'ing like a basketball
Soul food ham hocks, mayn that girl got it all
Seen her shopping in the mall, hips big waist small
These tricks be trying to spit the game, but she ain't feeling y'all
Catch it plastic, the girl got plenty money
You try to play her for a fool, but end up like a dummy
Tattoo on the tummy, girl sweet like it's honey
She likes to bounce it in the club, some'ing like a bunny
It's ballers in the club mayn, they pull up on them dubs mayn
Plus 26's, so you know they us love mayn
Pulled up gripping grain, V.I.P. champagne
Top flo' throwing money, know we trying to make it rain
Call me the weatherman, the way I get this cheddar man
You trying to beat me, better come up with a better plan
I roll with a better clan, keep the girl wetter man
You talk down on my click, and trying to sweat her man

[Hook]
Get to bouncing, get to bouncing in the club
Girl you know how to do it, when you trying to meet a thug
Now get to bouncing, (get to bouncing)
Playgirl get to bouncing, (get to bouncing-get to bouncing)
Now get to bouncing, get to bouncing on the flo'
Girl you know how to do it, when it's time to make that do'
Now get to bouncing, (get to bouncing)
Playgirl get to bouncing, (get to bouncing-get to bouncing)

[C-Note]
But she don't want a scrub, she only want a thug
And I don't mind, if she bounce that ass up in the club
She always show me love, she always thinking of
Different positions, cause you know she likes that freaky stuff
Table dance lap dance, bout to make me tap dance
Up in V.I.P., you only get one chance
She know that I got them stacks, she know just how to act
We got them swisher sweets, blowing like back to back
Took her out to the Lac, then she saw the Maybach
Can't explain my Clover chain, like an artifact
BBS 85, Cloverland till I die
Niggas try to disrespect a nigga, watch him pull his fly
Keep the strap on my side, represent the Southside
What we swang and we banging, leave your mouth wide
Wood wheel on guide, chrome wheels on glide
Baby girl like to bouncing, when we pass by

[Hook]
Now get to bouncing, get to bouncing on that pole
Girl you know how to do it, go on and make that jelly roll
And get to bouncing, (get to bouncing)
Playgirl get to bouncing, (get to bouncing-get to bouncing)
Now get to bouncing, girl you know I don't trip
See you coming out your clothes, I don't mind if you strip
Now get to bouncing, (get to bouncing)
Playgirl get to bouncing, (get to bouncing-get to bouncing)

[B.G. Duke]
Shorty I been watching you, work that pole
Up and down like whoa, bend over touching your toes
Got a nigga, throwing that do'
I ain't never seen a ass, clap like that befo'
See I'm a butt man, I like a nice culo
A superhead hoe, ain't afraid to deep throat
C-Note my bro, I'm B.G. Duke
And it ain't no fun, if my homies can't fuck too
I'm bout that money man, I'm from Cloverland
Loot V-12 Benz, on rubberbands
24 inches, keep me with a lot of bitches
Gator boots and mink coats, nigga that's pimping
