(*talking*)
Put your money on, put your money on me
Big Shots, Backdo' Lil' Joe the shizzit

[C-Note]
Put your money on me, I move like a half a ki'
Coming down, in the J-A-G
Represent for the S.U.C., I know these boys wanna get to me
But you know, it ain't no catching me
Now, who wanna be next up
Like Heins, got these niggas playing catch up
Seven albums and counting, my whole hood standing tall like a mountain
Smoking herb flipping birds, sipping syrup out the fountain
Feel me, now who wanna step in the ring
The niggas with the most bling, and the ching-ching
Ding-ding, round one
Knocking niggas off they feet, is the outcome
Now where we from the Southside, we put them blades on a ride
And roll buck hide, we put them screens on the inside
But this time, we ain't cutting no slack
Few niggas is some copycats

[Hook - 4x]
Put your money on me

[Godfather]
Call folk and set it, playa we can bet it
Clear your whole debit account, you'll regret it
We be private jetted, supreme unleaded
Bet against us, you look real pathetic
We be authentic, you be synthetic
I ball for Pittsburgh, like Bettis
Like Bugs Bunny, carrots and lettuce
Warner Brother bunny, boys down in Texas
Put your money, where your mouth is
Botany, Houston Texas Dirty South kids
See the cash on the table, Big Shots be the label
Soldiers like the Marines, or the Naval
Top streak, keep a Glock heat
My niggas got more gold, than a swap meet
Big Jaguars, been had cars
Peace to Big Daz, he behind fat bars

[Hook - 4x]

[Will-Lean]
Put your money where your mouth is, Sugarland is where the vault is
Cloverland, is where the South is
I talk shit, cause my money is long
Money trail from the dome, to the front of my home
Everything that I own, I flaunt on chrome
Paper tags and pay cash, when I jump in the zone
My money is strong, cause ain't with that spending shit
Invested in my hood, like my name was Merrel Lynch
It's that Will Gates, with mills in steel crates
Diamonds on chill, princess cut and grill plates
The Chemist, put your money on me
Like you put them Giovannis, on that black Humvee
We them superstar niggas, that these hoes come see
Bend over let me see it, like my boy Bun B
We ball to sun deep, bitches we done three
For all my homies, put your money on me

[Hook - 4x]
