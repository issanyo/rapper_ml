Alright, c note c note
I don't want you talking about me
'cuz we got the same circle of friends
It's bad enough to know you're okay without me
I don't need to hear it coming from them
Seems everybody's been seeing you everywhere
They all talk about you smiling face (oh baby)
Seems to me that if you ever cared
You could show a little heartache
You don't have to cry forever
I'd never ask that much of you
After all the time together
It's just so hard to do
Don't you still remember
All the things we've been through
Don't cry forever, baby
Just cry a tear or two
Don't need to know you're seeing somebody
Or that you're up to your old tricks again
You can be anywhere that you want to be
But not the places the two of us went
Don't you see, it could be a mistake
Not to show a little little little heartache
You don't have to cry forever (baby baby)
I'd never ask that much of you
After all the time together
Is it so hard to do (so hard to do)
Don't you still remember
All the things we've been through
Don't cry forever, baby
Just cry a tear or two
And just as soon as you do, yeah girl
I'll say I'm missing you too)
Just tell me that you're missing me.. baby
All you got to do is .. tell me
You don't have to cry forever (baby baby)
I'd never ask that much of you
After all the time together
Is it so hard to do (so hard to do)
Don't you still remember
All the things we've been through
Don't cry forever, baby
Just cry a tear or two
I need you to cry for me
Just not forever...(don't cry, brody, dru, d-lo)
That's all you gotta do
