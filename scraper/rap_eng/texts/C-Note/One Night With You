I don't wanna put no chains on you
I just wanna be here loving you
Cuz you touch me in the place
That puts a smile right on my face
But I don't wanna be holding you
Baby only for an hour or two
I want you with me
In these arms for all eternity
I don't mean to put you under pressure
I just wanna spend some time together
And baby if it's just for one night
Give me just one night with you
Every day of your life
One kiss every morning
After a hundred kisses each night
Give me just one night with you
Everyday for all time
It would be so right
Every day to have just one night with you
Love the things you say, the way you move
I'd love to stay here making love with you
Cuz you're just so good to hold
And you've wrapped your arms around my soul
So come on and take this heart of mine
You can have it till the end of time
I want you to be part of every single part of me
I don't mean to put you under pressure
I just wanna have your love forever
So baby if it's just for one night, one night
Give me just one night with you
Every day of your life
One kiss every morning
After a hundred kisses each night
Give me just one night with you
Everyday for all time
It would be so right
Every day to have just one night with you
Baby, give me your kisses for a lifetime
Baby, show me you smiling face each day girl
Baby, hold me in your heart forever (david and mels part)
Cuz I need you by my side
And I won't be satisfied
Till you give me just one night with you
Every day of your life
One kiss every morning
After a hundred kisses each night
Give me just one night with you
Everyday for all time
It would be so right
Every day to have just one night with you
One night with you for all my life
One kiss from you for all time
One smile from you all of my days
All of your love for always
I just want to love you babe
Every day of your life
For the rest of your life
OH baby baby baby
