We can, get it started
If you want it, come on (raise it up)
Shorty turn it around, show me what you working with
Show me what you working with, bounce
All my thugs, in the club
Wild out if you got that dro, then (blaze it up)
Burn it, and pass it around
And grab you a skirt kid, and grab you a skirt kid

[E.S.G.]
Raise it up like snipe war, with a rambo flag
See I'm raising up the Southside, sliding down the slab
Helped a lot of niggas out, but they ain't help me
So this year its all about, Mr. E.S.G
I connected with my nigga T-H-U-G Dirt
C.D.'s DVD's, you know we got work
Big dingles with the skirts, Escallade dripping syrup
From the city, where them lil' white birds don't chirp
Tonight's the night, club packed hell-a-tight
In the back sipping Hypno, same color as my ice
Light blue, bout two dime pieces trying to hit the dro
Oh no hoe, unless we going to the Mo'
24 times 4, that's the wheels I roll
Fo' time ten forty, Cal. Glock gon blow
Oh no let her go, no use for handcuffs
Raise it up blaze it up, all the thugs stand up what

[Hook]

[Thug Dirt]
Excuse me Ms., you can start giving dome
I'm bout to hit the spot, so tonight you're alone
Raw hit me on the hips, say the club so thick
Say they elbow to ass, getting drunk than a bitch
And that fine ass chick, we done told her to strip
We done bought the bar, you ain't gotta pay for shit
Yeah I'ma grab me a throwback, put a hat on
I'll be there, soon as I can park all this chrome
Come on, we can raise it up
Yeah, show Thug Dirt the tricks you do with your butt
Come on, we can blaze it up
I got a big bag of sticky, get us all messed up
Let's twist one up, mami head gone
Off a blunt, and a bottle of a Cris'
She was grabbing at the chain, saw the ice in the ring
Say I'm the one that she leaving with yeah, raise it up

[Hook]

[C-Note]
Uh raise it up, raise it up
Cause some of my G's, like to blaze it up
Got niggas up in Cali, purple haze it up
But my niggas down South, like the purple cups
Houston, Dallas, Jackson, Atlanta
Florida, Alabama back to Louisiana
All of my niggas, that's up in the club
All of my niggas, get buck in the club
Raise it up in the club, show 'em what's up
With a thug, fa sho we get it crunk in the club
It's a down South thang, down South slang
Raise your arms in the air, palms up mayn
And then we start, roofing in this bitch
And then we get loose, up in this bitch
Grey Goose up in this bitch, hit the juice up on the switch
Matter fact, keep the juice on this bitch
