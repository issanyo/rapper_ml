[Intro]
Yuh, yuh, yuh
Do it for the winners
Strictly for the winners
Strictly for the winners
Strictly for the winners
Strictly for the winners
Strictly for the winners
Strictly for the winners
Strictly for the winners
Strictly for the winners
Strictly for the winners
Strictly for the winners
Strictly for the winners

[Chorus]
Ayy, let's just keep it real
Cause you ain't keep it real
Tell me what's the deal
I ain't tell nobody but I'm about to sign a deal

[Verse 1]
Hope the Lord forgive me
For all the sins I committed in my life
Strippers in the club and they're dancing every night
Lord forgive 'em cause you know they ain't living right
Lord forgive me cause I'ma be in there tonight
Know I'm a beast but I ain't living on the hype
[?] I ain't talking about the the dyke
If I gotta be there I'ma fly there over night
First class on the flight

[Chorus]
Let's just keep it real
Cause you ain't keep it real
Tell me what's the deal
I ain't tell nobody but I'm about to sign a deal
Niggas say they know me, man this shit been getting real
Gotta keep it silent when you playing in the field
But back then they didn't want me now they tryna chill

[Verse 2]
Rolly on my wrist got my wrist on froze
Only fuck 'em once then dismiss them hoes
You the type of nigga that'll miss them hoes
I'm the type of nigga that'll frisk them hoes
Before they enter the estate
I don't know you, put your phone on the tray
Gucci's in the home bitch I'm grown, don't play
Got in your face, Olay
[?]
Bitch we only going hard now
Used to want a little bit but now a nigga want it all now
Hit the town then we ball out
Ain't too much that changed nigga
[?] nigga
And them bitches yeah they came quickly
If I removed all your chains, you a lame nigga
It's a shame nigga
Fuck you and every nigga who came with you

[Chorus]
Let's just keep it real
Cause you ain't keep it real
Tell me what's the deal
I ain't tell nobody but I'm about to sign a deal
Niggas say they know me, man this shit been getting real
Gotta keep it silent when you playing in the field, for real
But back then they didn't want me now they tryna chill
