(Hook 1)
I’m spending all this money that we stack and it’s tax free I’m headed to the top I  guarantee that you won’t pass me I’m riding through the City sipping lean in the  back seat living like a sinner guess I’m something like a Black Sheep

(Verse 1)
I’m young and I strive its only foreign that we drive my whole team fly we young fortunes on the rise, my Jersey boys be doing it I’m a wild boy who be losing it, I’ll die over my rap bars I’m so true to it you clueless bitch I’m on the road to getting stupid rich doing what the fuck we want my life is like a movie flick so Zoga out here shooting it Mulisha Mafia Chosen Few (Chosen Few) is who I’m cooling with I’m A-Harsh man and I get crazy drunk, Mystic Wax got me faded up one dab got me higher than any amount of Jays that you be blazing up and I stay with cups that are tall and white with a little potion that you mix with Sprite, get some ice (Mud) I’ll pour you up and promise that you’ll feel so right. Chauffeured in the back seat ducking from the copies, show girls sloppy off MD and the Molly, Jersey they say party, loud packs of the Marley, I’m a Rolling Stone man my life is so snarly
