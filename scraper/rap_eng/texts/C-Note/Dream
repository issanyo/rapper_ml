[Intro: C-Note]
Had a dream that I could live like a king

Thats deep, too steep


{Verse: C-Note}
Had a dream that I could live like a king
Have everybody bow down and kissing my rings
Have everybody listen to the songs that I sing
Them have em all sing it but it was all a dream
I thought i would i do it big, thought i would be notorious
Thought it was gone be easy, thought it was gone be glorious
Thought I could be remembered by future historians
But happily ever after is never how HIStory ends
For a moment I had started to become enslaved
Started rapping about money whips and chains
Then I realized this ain't me its time for a change
Im smarter than that now i gotta start using my brain
Everybody been asking "Man yo Chris what you been on?"
Well I'm not tryna be on what everybody get on
I always thought to get on you know, you gotta be on
Now i see you have to be owned in order to get on
Nah, Id rather take my own chance and walk my own path
And I’m here to double excel you better know that
New rappers already washed up like old rags
But I won’t stop until I’m dead, toe tags
I know a few people thats been ready to plot
And we plan to takeover the operation ain't stopped
We ain't like lebron, we ain't ready to flop
We going all the way up and y’all ready to drop
Step in the arena if you ready to talk
Step into my  square if you ready to box
Before you take a step,you gotta crawl fore you walk
So ask yourself one thing, are you ready or not?
Cause i can tell yes i can tell
They ain't ready for the heat so ring the fire bell
They see me rolling in the deep so say hello adele
They don’t wanna see me succeed they hoping hope would fail
Thats a hopeless tale
Word to Tee Grizzley they been praying on my downfall
But shoutout to them haters, couldn’t make it here without y’all
To tell the truth i ain't really care about y’all
Cause honestly I’m number one and i wouldn’t even  count yall
Now we talking numbers always count me in don’t never count me out
Cause if i fall back i always bounce up like a bouncy house
Im the topic y’all should talk about
Cause when it comes down to being real just know that i ain't opting out
And this is not a boost for my ego
This pure confidence its just on automatic reload
The game foul thats why i been shooting free throws
And I’ve been on my game y’all boys gon need a cheat code
All Good I’m tryna make my business straight
Y’all ain't have to teach me nothing man I been this great
Then they ask me why I’m going hard I been this way
Ill freestyle every morning till i get to Sway
Breaking hearts with 808s until i get to Ye
Following the blueprints until i get to Jay
I could never be comfortable with being uncomfortable thats why i hustle hard same theme, different days(whoa)
Yes lord the real is back
Kinda fell off but now i got my feeling back
Yeah I’m going crazy but my mind still in tact
I'll never stop being me and thats a fact
Now let me give you the keys to get to the top
Don’t ever let nobody take ya spot
And if you got dreams keep dreaming till you get there
And when you get there don’t let yo dreaming ever stop
And thats real

[Outro: C-Note]
I had a dream that I could live like a king
Have everybody bow down and kissing my rings
(repeat 4x)
