[Hook: C-Note]
You told me you love me you want me you need me
But you been cheating and now you like "can we just work it out?"
Like "Can we just work it out?"
But you been  fuckin with niggas thats fucking with bitches
That be in my business so baby ain't nothing to talk about
There ain't nothing to talk about


[Verse 1: C-Note]
What's there to talk about?
Cause of that shit you was doing, it drove me insane
So dont try to call me now
Cause I deleted yo contacts I don't know yo name
But Imma still call you out
Because of what you was doing you should feel ashamed
So call that nigga that was balling out
Well I guess that nigga ain't ballin now
See you wanted a lil fame
Trying to be a player in the game
Trying to make yourself a name
But you can't
Really try to gain something from the pain that you caused
Look at yourself
You was moving too fast, now you gotta swerve better stay in your lane
Cause one thing I can't do is keep falling for the same shit
Girl it's time to move on yeah yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2: C-Note]
See I gave you everything
And I gave you all of me
So I don't know why you wasting your time
Cause every since you came up missing
Everything bout me different
Girl I think I'm starting to find my mind
So I don't need that negativity in my life no more
No I don't want you to be my wife no more
Been doing just fine, been having a good time
And no I don't dream about you at night anymore
Aye
You outta my sight
My heart took that L it put up a good fight
What goes on in the dark always come to the light
Now every since I left you been trying to make it right shit crazy
