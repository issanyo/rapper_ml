Good Bye
It's time for me to go
I'll call you in the morning
So I can let you know
The way i really feel girl
To put your mind at ease
If i don't then who will
If i make it i still
Want you to be there with me

You say
You'll love and then you'll learn
You'd learn to love me baby
And wait till i return
I know it hasn't been easy
To love a man like me
Someday if we try
There will be no goodbyes
And we will live happily

Cuz I'll be there one day
And you will be right next to me
I'll be there one day
And you will be right next to me

Hey there, will you be where I am?
Will you be by myside girl
Or with another man?
Just wait a little longer
Girl,I don't know how long
Just try to understand
This is not what I planned
I'm sorry this had to be

Girl, oh girl, every man needs a woman
You're the woman that I choose
And I can't afford to lose you baby

I'll be there one day
And you will be right next to me
I'll be there one day
And you will be right next to me

I swear to the world, you'll always be my girl
Just say you'll be, right next to me
I'll be there one day
And you'll be right next to me
