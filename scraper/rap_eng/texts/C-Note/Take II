Im back with the rapping, Im back with the action
My life is a movie, but Im not an actor
These niggas is goofies, they bitches is groupies
They all wanna choose me, cause my pockets fatter
My flow like jacuzzis, it spray like a uzi
You losers be losing, this shit can't get sadder
Your girls wanna screw me, and I got the toolie
If she set it up then she nailed like a hammer
This shit knock like a 808, but Im knocking shit out like Im Cassius Clay
And Im knocking shit out on a day to day
And this is my shot I won't fade away
Im sorry I got to go hard today
I gotta get pesos like andele
There won't be no peace, ain't no namaste
They say they killing me well no not today
And somebody said C-Note ain't killing the game?
Well who was that nigga that spoke on my name
Let me tell you something if I ever hear my name once
Then Im gonna guarantee your name is never spoken again
Let me tell you what Im gonna do if I catch you saying it twice
Imma just uuhh, let it pass with a strike
But if I catch you three times you better pray for your life
Cause it ain't gon be bad but it ain't nothing nice
I fear no life, boy stay in yo life
Ill end yo life, boy I seen yo life
It didn't go slow, but it didn't go far
It took a sorry turn on this pivot of ours
N-O-R I could say it did go hard
Car gold with the top blue there goes Marge
If it ain't about the pesos then its adios
Goddamit I got Pablo Escobars
I got gas yall on E, well F on ours
I take flight then I step on Mars
Your girl like my bars, she say them go hard
She say she benching you and him gon start
I got game you N-O-T, fucking with me
So walk away please, theres nothing to see
So you ain't nothing to be
And you ain't nothing to me
I come hard on the track like I'm fucking the beat
I go hard on the track yeah I can't be defeat
Im an animal ain't no taming this beast
And Im hungry, feel like having rappers to feast
To turned up like Im disturbing the peace
Im on an incline, while yall steady decrease
C dash N-O to the T-E
Illest rapper alive now everybody deceased
Woo!
Flashing lights likes emergencies
Cutting up like surgery
Don't let but shit occur to me
Move with a new sense of urgency, yeah
Catch me smoking on a purple tree
Got me feeling like Hercules
I take mine I never heard of please
Like Im lacking common courtesy
Say you niggas never heard of me
She ain't got no job, but she working me

Yeah
Take 2



BITCH
