[Hook: C-Note]
I got it I got it
I got it I got it
No need to explain no more, I got it  I got it
I got it I got it
I got it I got it
No need to explain no more
Aye
(Repeat)

[Verse 1: C-Note]
I got it I got it
I got it I got it
These days I been getting straight, I been getting paid
But I need more
Tired of being in the same place, man I need change
I be bored
This that real shit you can't ignore
You I know I got it like a store
Plug bout to roll up the dank yeah
Yeah you know that gas stank yeah
Fill up the gas tank yeah
And we bout to run up the bank yeah
I see y'all can't relate
Like a line you need to get it straight
I keep it 100 while y'all kept it fake
Them walking away was their biggest mistake
Had some friends turn to enemies
Now they wanna turn into me
Yeah they wanna be a mini me
But won't measure up like symmetry
I remember y'all wasn't feeling me
Now I'm glowing like a Christmas tree
Reign longer than a century
Yea I got the crown yes I'm a king

[Hook]

[Verse 2: DZY.]
They gotta feel me from Boston to Compton
They gotta see how we ran it up like we ran out of options
Holding it down, catch me holding some stocks and
Holding them hostage
Bitch, don’t you be watching my pockets
Just know I got it, I got it
I feel like Ye when he dropped out of college
Kicking in the door and how could you knock it?
I am a prophet
Heard your new shit and I’m not really rocking
Sounds good but you’re not being honest
But if you wanna know how to do it, just drop a deposit
And I’ll get it popping, Let’s get it popping
Hold up
I had to get it for mama nem
This shit just boosting my confidence
I love all the compliments
But let’s take the comments and turn them to dollars then
Yeah
Niggas be faking accomplishments
Niggas faker than collagen
Summer coming, getting hot again
Guess that means some bodies finna drop again
Guess we got this shit

[Hook]
