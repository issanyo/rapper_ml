Money in my life, money in my life
So I can blow trees in the breeze, and stack G's
Money in my life, money in my life
C-Note I got this shit on freeze, I'm moving like ki's
Money in my life, money in my life
A million dollas later, still I miss my nigga Gator
Money in my life, money in my life
A Botany big shot on them dots, a true playa

[C-Note]
I need money in my life, so I can flip me some ki's
I need money in my life, so I can stack me some G's
I need money in my life, so I can buy the whole tree
I need money in my life, so I can set my niggas free
It seems the whole world's after you, trying to sue
The FED's trying to find a clue, just keep it true
Just rolling with my real niggas, that's all I feel
You see that bubble eyed Benz, my diamond grill
See me in a 2000 Lotus, I'm glad you noticed
I'm fucking with you nigaz focus, like hocus pocus
I'm bound to make a million dollas, on a bad day
My niggas call me Luchiano, cause my cash ways

[Hook]
Money in my life, money in my life
When I step into the club, y'all niggas show me love what up
Money in my life, money in my life
When you see me hitting switches, I'm all about the riches
Money in my life, money in my life
Botany Boys keep it real, a million dollar deal
Money in my life, money in my life
When I pull up to my show, bout fo' deep in the Rolls

[C-Note]
You heard, I got a little money in
Now you holding out your hand, trying to be my friend
Nigga that's the end life's no joke, when I was broke I couldn't smoke
Now it's money by the boats, with no car notes
Diamond clovers foreign shouffers, custom sofas
Now it's money in my life, like the stock brokers
Stretched my ends stretched my Benz, and stretched my tens
Now I let the top down, with smoke in the wind
I'm balling out of control, a million records sold
You wanna check my toll, a nigga ghetto gold
Gotta keep stacking papers, tall as skyscrapers
Boys keep trying for capers, while hoes catching vapors
I pop em all like trunks, trying to live like Trump
No more standing on the front, just million dollar stunts
I'm living ghetto dreams, addicted to the cream
I started serving fiends, I'm claiming clover green

[Hook]
Money in my life, money in my life
When you see me gleaming twice, you know I'm covered in ice
Money in my life, money in my life
A million dollas worth of diamonds, can you niggas pay the price
Money in my life, money in my life
We did thousands of shows, and left with plenty niggas hoes
Money in my life, money in my life
So much ice you catch a cold, Botany Boys on the road

[C-Note]
I guess the world, is filled with clovers now
I'm making money out the ass, they can't hold us down
For my cousin Gator, floss the Benz and Navigator
I battle you hater, ice just like a skaters my crib got elevators
Diamonds grills and niggas real, I thought I told ya
Back to back paper stack nigga, it's all fold up's
Two niggas in the back, wanna jack for my stacks
But they don't know we coming deep, in a tinted Lac
We got boys with K's, rich niggas on blades
Screaming thought of many ways to get paid, cradle to the grave
We balling at Clover, Lexus Lan' or the Rover
Botany tatted on my arm, C-Note tatted by my shoulder it's over

[Hook]
Money in my life, money in my life
When I step into the club, y'all niggas show me love what up
Money in my life, money in my life
When you see me hitting switches, I'm all about the riches
Money in my life, money in my life
Botany Boys keep it real, a million dollar deal
Money in my life, money in my life
When I pull up to my show, bout fo' deep in the Rolls
