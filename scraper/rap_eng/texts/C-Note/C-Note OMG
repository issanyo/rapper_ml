[Hook: C-Note]

C-Note oh my God! C-Note oh my God! yeah oh my God!



[Verse: C-Note]
C-Note oh my God! Whoa I can't be stopped
I see myself in the bigger picture and it ain't photoshopped
Yeah Oh my God!
I know im gonna make it and I put that on my guys
I know haters trying to put me down but guess what? Still I rise
Yeah yeah
I dont think they know who they fuckin with
I get the bag, I flip it, I get it tumbling
Stepping over these haters I'm never stumbling
Throwing squares out my circle, royal rumbling
So stay away from me
And this is my shot I won't fadeaway
Young nigga getting paid today
If you play about my cash I turn to Cassius Clay
BAR$ heavyweight, knock em out
Call up Nick Cannon cause I'm wild'n out
Yeah I'm going crazy, yeah im spazzing out
Going looney on them tunes, man I'm tazzin out

[Hook]

[Outro: C-Note]
Aye
Real talk, I feel so confident in this song right now
I ain't even gonna rap no more on it
I ain't gotta put another verse on it, I ain't gotta put another hook on it
Matter of fact I ain't gon say shit else
Imma let my beat play on you weak ass niggas
Haaan
