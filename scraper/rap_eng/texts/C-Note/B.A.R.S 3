[Intro: Broke Ass Rapper]
Awww yeah I get to rap now ?
Turn the auto tune on

[Verse: Broke Ass Rapper]
Niggas know I got a lot of guap
And I be on the block
And I be bussing at the opps
My nina give you top
I come thru with the Glock
And this shit ain't never  ever gon stop
When I was 10 my teacher told me I wouldn't be shit
Now everyday Im walking around asking for free shit
I like yo song I just might make a remix
So I ain't really gotta pay you for your beat bitch
Yeah, thats how Im coming this year
Matter of fact thats how Im bumming this year
I was bumming last year, but they did not feel me
Now I just come thru with the Glock you gotta kill me
Salute me or shoot me
I be in the studio and I might give your bitch a roofie
I be off a molly, I be off the percs
Now I gotta fucking hang this up and go to work
Yeah




Bars, thats how im coming my new mixtape coming Neveruary 32nd
