[Intro: C-Note]
Had some friends turn to enemies
I swear its just meant to be
It gotta be meant to be
Yeah yeah

[Hook: C-Note]
Had some friends turn to enemies
Niggas turned fake now I don't feel they energy
Now you can't come close to me if you ain't kin to me
Now I'm the greatest no debating its just meant to be
(Repeat 3x)

[Verse 1: C-Note]
Cooking up that hot shit you cannot get the recipe
My shit be so live, y’all some dead boys rest in peace
This yo funeral Im dressed in all black ebony
Pull up in a all white thing I call her Stephanie
Aye
Y’all boys cannot even mess with me
They call my C-Note, being 100 is my specialty
Make sure you have the right approach before you step to me
All my exes did me wrong now they want a check from me
No
That ain't how the shit go
Everyday I wake up thinking “Gotta get more”
Gotta get fresh, yeah i gotta get dope
Yeah I gotta get bread, yeah I gotta get dough
Whoa
Still smoking on that gas, Citgo
And since we talking bout that gas yo bitch have my shit rolled, aye
Still smoking on that gas Citgo
And since we talking bout that gas yo bitch have my shit rolled, aye

[Hook]

[Verse 2: C-Note]
All I, all I, all I
All I really know is that it's meant to be
Realist nigga walking you can see it my genes
Y'all know the boy cold get the antifreeze
Been down now I'm up I'm feeling heavenly
Word up
And I'm still going just getting past the surface
We the new wave and y'all gon have to surf us
Got bars and y'all out here barely getting service
So tell me what's yo purpose, you looking uncertain
You need to decide and please make your choice urgent
If you gon be All Good and if not then you can swerve on
I be going off and this that shit they wanna turn on
Now it looks like Im the one that they wish they never turned on

[Hook]
