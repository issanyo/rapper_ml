[Verse 1]
Niggas watch me style my dogs
She toss bars not salad, dog
Fuck her good, pass her to my dogs
Broken ankle how hard I ball
Nigga trip I’mma get 'em wacked
Smokin' kush, holdin' up with the set
Real nigga comin through on her back
I been clockin enough lane cracks
Thousand dollar roll' my dog, now tell me don’t lose no laws
Shorty just lock and load
'Til the block explode
Selling rock ‘n’ roll, keep a heavy metal
Beefin' with you suicide, you gon meet the devil
You know I'm so ghetto, boy you fuckin' know it
First time with money, so I’m finna fuckin show it
All that motherfuckin cash – I’mma blow it
Throw it throw it throw it, motherfuckin' throw it

[Hook]
The bricks go for 35, that’s KD
RIP if he fuck with me
Beefin' with me, better have a army
Shooters all around me, wish a nigga try me
Bricks 35, that’s KD
Nigga fuck with me, RIP
Beefin' with me, you better have a army
Shooters all around me, what's up motherfucker try me

[Verse 2]
Say I’m laughin' at em
I said I’m laughin' at em
0 tolerance, that’s West Brook
Street educated, I don’t need a book
Show prices so high they think I’m sellin' white
Tryna fuck a nigga wife tonight, a-ight
This a molly, baby gon bite, a-ight
Smokin' weed, drinkin' Ace of Spades all night
Ballin' ass young nigga, all I do is flex
My Rollie cost 80, his shit cost 50
Different tax bracket my young nigga’s hands sticky
Trigger finger itchy, I aim it for her pussy
Grew up on the block sellin' Vickies
Tryna get them Benjis, stack 'em to the ceilings nigga
Blowin' money like a drug dealer
You ain’t doin shit I did last year
I'm runnin' circles 'round you fuck niggas

[Hook]
