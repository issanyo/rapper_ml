It's going down
'96 Screwed Up Click, knowimtalmbout
We done popped up in here, knowm say'n
D.E.A., Southside Playaz, Botany Boyz, down deep
3 4 action, knowm talkn bout, 2201 knowm say'n
Smokin' big, drinking syrup, knowm talkin' bout

Well one time for yo mind let a playa come through
I'm sippin on a 4 and I'm jammin' on that Screw,
It's Southside Playaz and this playa down for [?]
Cuz a young nigga got a million dollar function.
Living so throwed in this game, drankin drank
Got man what throwed in the game
Now I'm banking stacks, marble door 'lacs
Moved up the [?] is how I act
A little bit crazy, fuck these damn ladies,
all up on my dingaling cuz a Mercedes.
Really ain't wit it, let that 9 milli start spittin,
Round up the rhyme and drop them playa haters down,
From the other side if you start plexin
It's that Southside, third ward fucking Texas
Boys don't know I'm candy red up on the scene
A young nigga sipping codeine, with my mug on mean
With that Fat to the Pat, how the fuck you gon' act,
A rat-tat-tat-tat with my 9 millimeter gat
So boys better raise the fuck up off me,
Cuz that boy Mike D is living the John fucking Gotti
in the game.

Coming down blazed knowm say'n
third Coast, fucking it up

Niggas keep looking for my 'burban on them choppers
We be flipping through the Southside in helicopters
'Bout to land in the Clover, and no it ain't over
You got my boy dead but I'm also going fed
Because I got my damn steel on my side
Wherever the fuck I go I packs my gat up in my ride
Them niggas think I'm slipping, but hell no we ain't
That's all we do is sipping, syrup in the paint.
My boy Mike D got a whole cup of lean,
Them Southside Playaz acting bad on the scene
That's all we do is lean,
Come down South
