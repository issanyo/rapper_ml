[Verse: C-Note]
New day but still the same me
I ain't rocking to the same beat
Catch the wave, I'm feelin wavy
On top of the rock like Jay Z
Smoking trees, Im feelin shady
Shoutout to the Chi, it made me
What yall niggas can't be
That's why these niggas hate me
Waking up and counting all my dollars
Grinding hard like its no tomorrow
Taking off and take this shit to Mars
Still a $olja, never camouflaged
Still a $olja, yes I'm a sarge
Military pressin all the bars
Never let my talent go to waste
Team full of shooters, Golden State
Trying to get them rings like Im Sonic
Im just trying to be the trending topic
Trying to be real big out here and these niggas seem microscopic
All the shit they talking on the net
Don't mean a thing we ain't impressed
Yall know that we be whats up
Hit the blunt and pass the shit to Knuck
Plugga be rollin the dope
Smoke gas I just go
Lungs healthy I don't choke
Stunned ya girl this dick be stone cold
She say she wanna get in the ring
But she can't run through the ropes
Sold her a million dollars and a dream
Only thing I have for bitches is hope
See I ran all out of fucks but my fucks ran a good race
And you ran all out of luck and its just yo luck yo girl give me face
And I got her down on all fours, I guess you can say it was fate
And I got her screaming out "Oh Lord!", yeah that mean she got good faith
Man I been A1 since like day one
I been a boss like Shang Tsung
She ain't never fucked with a real nigga and she fuck with you
So you ain't one
Now she fuck with me she can claim one
Im a god you better pray son
You can hide but you can't run
You been taking Ls so you ain't won
You been hating yes I can tell
On the internet you been typing well
Im taking off cause Im fly as hell
I been hot ring the fire bell
These new rules you better honor dude
Dont like Mr. T cause Im a fool
And yo girl give me head like she in honor school
Damn Im rude, ooh!
Middle fingers to my enemies
Them niggas ain't kin to me
Yall heads up each others asses
Modern day human centipede
Mixing light and dark in champagne glasses
Feels like Im doing chemistry
They went hollywood, Johnny Cage glasses
But them niggas never finished me
This is a shock I ain't talking Raiden
I step in the game I start hall of faming
This shit ain't sweet, ain't no Walter Payton
But you better believe it that Im the greatest
No room for your hating
We don't need your input
So end of discussion, lets not debate it
My nigga we made it
Now I can sit back, hit the blunt
Like percussions and now Im faded
AAAH


Bitch
