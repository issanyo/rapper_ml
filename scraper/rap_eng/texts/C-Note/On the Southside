[C-Note]
Candy paint, looking kinda clean
Fresh throwback, looking kinda mean
C-Note and Lil Flip, be on the scene
See we trying to stack, that Clover green
Ball in the daytime, ball in the night time
It really don't matter, we ball at the right time
See me in the Benzo, sitting on Lorenzo's
Smoking with my kin folk, with a tight dime
I floss through MLK (MLK)
I floss through S-A (S-A
I floss through South Park, and then Hiram Clark
Then I hit the breaks
My pockets, keep the mumps
Bobbing and weaving, and popping trunks
Texas boys, just ain't no punks
Watch a nigga run, when I bust the pump
I'm bout that paper though
Before I go broke, I'll break your hoe
Stand on the cut, and I'll push the snow
Pull up on Sprewells, and I'll take your hoe
Uh-oh uh-oh, that's Screwed Up Click
We always doing, that Screwed Up shit
Then we be sitting, in money pits
Steady be dropping, them platinum hits
Bitch this is Screwed Up music
Bitch niggas, don't confuse it
We lay back, in made backs
Bitch nigga, this is Screwed Up Houston
Snitch niggas, don't abuse it
All real, would like to fuse it
Flash that, and back to act a track
Cause that's, just how we do it

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil Flip]
Down here, we smoking green
We drinking purple, and riding red
Better watch your head, cause I'm chasing bread
I can't wait till AK, get out the FED
So we can do a track, and count paper stacks
I push Cadillacs, with fifth wheels in the back
I done took that hoe, to the shop
Now that bitch, candy black
I can't do that shit, music fast
I can screw that shit, if she got some ass
I'll screw that shit, and after that
Nigga you know my style, I never knew that bitch
I'm from the Southside, I'll leave your mouth wide
When I pull up, in that Benz
On twenty-twen-twins, I mean 20 inch Lorenz
Watch the money that you spend
You trying to impress, your friends
You can't afford that dro, go back to them 3-for-10's
The robber done closed down, so niggas doing bad
So if you get caught slipping my nigga, that's your ass

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil Flip]
We still fucking with Johnny, cause we making bigger money
You making that local money, I'm making that Jigga money
When I made it you should of said, yeah my niggas done it
The reason I turn my back, cause y'all niggas fronted
It's Flip and C-Note, we some Clover G's
I'm the first nigga in the hood, with yellow rocks in my piece
That's the way we do it nigga, we the Screwed Up Click
You fuck around with me and C, and we gon shoot up shit

[C-Note]
We hustled in this street game, we hustled for the street fame
We busting with this heat mayn, knock you out your seats mayn
From cake face to big mayn, we wrecking in these streets mayn
But most up in these niggas brains, just like them clicks mayn
But now them in the ground, cause we bust them niggas down
First niggas out they town, to put it down with this Screwed Up sound
I know my piece shine bright, I know my teeth shine bright
Like a headlight through the night, I know I'm gonna live my life

[Hook - 2x]
