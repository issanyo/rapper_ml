[Intro]
you're my lady always been so true
this is why , I sing this song for you
and you're my lady , always in my life,
and I want to thank you , for being down to ride,
[verse 1]
Forever yours forever mine our love will always
Shine no matter the situation you where always
By my side never the less you brought the
Best of me, the years that I' lived
only love that i got my right hand by best friend
who must of sent Such an angel to this world
that is cold you belong in the heavens not this
ignorant world you're my girl my all best thing
a man could ever have
I'm glad that your mine and I'm proud to be your man.
Understand that there's no other if there is just
A few staying true like you never breaking
No rule lord forgive me for the things I have done
To you if you weren't up in my life I wouldn't know
What to do won't complain about no money didn't
faze when I was broke all we needed was each other
Love to strong to let go
If I die tonight all I want to let you know
Remenise on what we had hold me thight
And don't let go girl.
[Chorus]
Oh girl you're the one for me,
Never ever let me down ,
You will always be around ,
Girl I have to thank you baby,
Always standing by my side ,
So don't you ever leave my life
[Verse 2]
Even through these hard times we continue to face,
It's like deep inside of me you could never be replaced,
Like when we struggle we get tested in faith,
But you been strong and stood by me every step-a-the-way,
I thank the lord for the day he brought you into my life,
Changed my world -my destiny - and gave me new life,
So if you got somebody special - that's always been true,
Show love and take note in everything that they do,
I could neva take fjor granted what she's done for me,
Even when we desagree she still stands by me,
Late night - road trips- showin' mad support,
The typa-girl-that every homie should be keepin' close,
'cause your that typa-a-girl that neva let me down,
Encouraged me to see the light when no one else would come
Around, down when I had money- and down when I was broke,
So if I die tonight hold me tight and don't let go!
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I guess that you can say I owe my life to you the
Only dream that really matters is to be with you cuzz
Even though we argue and we fight some times
you'll always be my queen until the end of times
I'm giving love to the one that always stood by my side
If you ever need me baby for you I give my life
You been so true that's why its you these feelings I won't
Hide my love goes out to you girl I never leave your side yeah,
[Chorus]
