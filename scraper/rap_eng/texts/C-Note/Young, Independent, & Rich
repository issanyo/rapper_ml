Third Coast nigga...

[Hook - 2x]
'Burbans, Bentleys, drops and hoes
Third Coast we living lavish, flashing rocks and fo's
See that Roley on my wrist, homie that ain't shit
Cause we young, independent and rich

[C-Note]
I'ma pull out this summer, in a platinum stretch Hummer
Letting the screens fall like rain, bang like thunder
Botany Boys/Screwed Up Click, we Third Coast fa sho
Boys be beating down your block, and bitch we beating down your do'
Acting bad up in a Jag, plenty starch in my jeans
I'm putting diamonds in your face, when I step on the scene
Diamond rings like a king, it's a Botany thing
In every city that I'm seen, we got them hoes on ding
And Cloverland Cloverland, mayn it's on for life
My blades cut like a light, my wrist is covered in ice
Candy paint from Ike, twenty karats in my grill
Way before we get a deal, I got's to stack me a mill
Diamonds all in your face, player haters wanna take my place
Look C-Note on a paper chase, look at the Glock up in your face
I'm making niggas catch out, when I pull it out
Got it dropping like it's hot, welcome to the South

[D-Red]
Stacking on the cabbage, living lavish on a hill
Wrecking grain leaving stains, from a G'd up skill
Now what's the deal on teach that, niggas hate we gon scratch that
Benz and 'Burbans we gon flip that, and paper we got that
Botany is the block, we rock in all spots
Toting Glocks sitting sideways, in a candy blue drop
On them hops, Clover piece wrecking the scene
Gripping the grain chopping up lanes, flipping a Cheve that's clean
Hitting the spot where gangstas play, and keep it on the low low
Serving caviar yeah, puffing on a sack of endo
Independent and rich, still breaking down bricks
Botany be the click, Cloverland I represent
To the fullest, where G's multiply by the seconds
Ain't no banging on records, even some real chin checkers
Mic wreckers blade flippers, grain grippers
Bitches on my zipper, D-Red the realest nigga

[Will-Lean]
You see the rocks on my hand, the yacht by the sand
19 inch monoblocks, with dots on rubberbands
Jumping out the Lex Land, to a stretch Navi van
Big Shots sitting on top, representing Cloverland
Stacking fans stacking grands, from Houston to Pakistan
Southside worldwide, like exotic let dance
Leaving em in a trance, hypnotized from my diamonds
Bezeltynes you never seen, steady shining and grinding
Leaning and blinging, while busters steady fiending and dreaming
Plotting and scheming, my bitches jocking and creaming
Leaving em wet, Will-Lean putting it down for my set
Drop the top on the Vette, pop the bottle of Moet
Double quick Rolex man, these boys be stunting
Multi-millionaire hunting, that's keeping the crowd jumping
Botany Boys stay bumping, we gon finish this shit
Cause we young CEO's, independent and rich
Diamonds shining, man these boys be stunting
Multi-millionaire hunting, that's keeping the crowd jumping
Botany Boys stay bumping, we gon finish this shit
Cause we young CEO's, independent and rich nigga
