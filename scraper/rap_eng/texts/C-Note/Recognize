[Intro: C-Note]
Yeah we All Good, yeah we All Good
Yeah we All Good, yeah we All Good
Yeah we All Good, yeah we All Good

[Hook: C-Note]

I do it for the fam, not the gram
All I can be is real, thats who I am
When yall gonna recognize? When yall gon recognize?
I do it for my team, we coming up
We all working hard and there ain't no giving up
When yall gonna recognize? When yall gon recognize
That we here?

[Verse 1: C-Note]
Aye, All Good
We out here on our grind, ain't no wasting time
So open up them blinds its our time to shine
I do it for my fam, I do it for my team
We won't stop till we go down in history
We had some let downs but ain't no giving up
We brush the hate off don't let it get to us
They say we won't make it cause we different
Well let me tell you what they say won't make a difference
Matter of fact, let me be the first one to say "Im proud of my brothers"
We done been to Hell and back, I'll make it out with my brothers
We always got each others back stay looking out for each other
I pledge allegiance to the squad, I put it all on my brothers
I swear
I never doubted my brothers
Sometimes they get on my nerves, but im still down for my brothers
And even if we all walking Imma ride for my brothers
Cause at the end of the day, I'll still die for my brothers
Forreal

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Knuck]
In life obstacles will hit you from all different angles
Just know your plan put in your work so don't do no explaining
Look in my daughter eyes, a spitting image made me change too
Before I knew it moving fast and I wasn't the same dude
Some of em turned on me, I wouldn't run with the same crew
Been at the range kept me a target, been practicing aim too
Learned it early, never trust a bitch
Cause lack of knowledge and stupidity just don't mix
Got steered the wrong way, got took out the game quick
Do it for that check cause some people chasing that fame shit
They intentions not meaning good, watch who you hang with
Plus talk is cheap and that money speaking is language
Make sure that you focused on your grind
And most is out to steal your shine
And everybody from the bottom out here claiming how they climbed
And I told my brothers its our time to shine
Sometimes you gotta recognize to go and grind
Sometimes you gotta recognize to go and grind
You know you gotta recognize to put in overtime
Lets Go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: DZY.]
Right here
They wasn't with us at the bottom of the barrel
Used to wear hand me downs, now we make our on apparel(All Dat)
Tell my brothers move smart, move careful
One thing we can't do is lose we ain't prepared to
Most people don't believe until its too late
Until they see you going up, they get the screw face
You trippin on your own shoelace
Nigga been spitting like he a fucking toothache
They must want the old me, they don't really know me
But I recognize the snake eyes, shout out Kobe
Only with the fam cause niggas cross you like the number 3 in '03
We all we got wise words from my OG
We in OT, balling like Lamar until I OD
Spitting like Lamar until I OD
Its not that they don't hear us, its really that they fear us
But when I look in the mirror nigga this is what I told me

[Hook]
