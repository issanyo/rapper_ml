It's working...
A different kind of love is what you give to me
The type of love experience I know that I have never seen
You take me to a place of ecstasy I've never been before
You give me all the love I need real good, and baby so much more
Baby can we talk for a second
This feeling you give is so good that I can not deny
Cuz you love has got me open
Girl it's a mystery what you do to me
I never felt this kind of love
Your warm embrace your gentle touch
Girl it feels so strange
But please never change
I hope this feeling never stops
Cause I can feel it in my heart
Constantly growing inside this different kind of love
A different kind of love is what you give to me
The type of love experience I know that I have never seen
You take me to a place of ecstasy I've never been before
You give me all the love I need real good and baby so much more
I like it when you get into your sexy mode
You start to take control say things with that sexy tone
Girl you mesmerize me and it does surprise me
Cause I never thought that I would ever fall so deep
Girl I am addicted to the love you give the things you do
No complaints from me
Girl your love is so complete
I can't point out just what it is
That makes me feel and act this
Baby I'm beggin' for your different kind of love
A different kind of love is what you give to me
The type of love experience
I know that I have never seen
You take me to a place of ecstasy I've never been before
You give me all the love I need real good and baby so much
