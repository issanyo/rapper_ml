You looking good girl, I'm trying to get with ya
The way you bouncing it, make me wan' put some dick in ya
Shake it a lil' harder, you got your game right
You can get paid for your service, you play your hand right
I'm talking pretty so fine, you was a horse you'd be a Clidesdale
Body shape proper, like your mama feed you cornbread
Bad to the bone, puffing purple drinking hard liquor
Body language speaking, that she looking for a thug nigga
Truly some'ing special, with your thong set on
So small I can tell, you got a damn thang on
Every bitch bopping in the club, you the one girl
Let me see your pussy, the hand full of ones girl
We gon buy the bar out, sho' I brought my dogs with me
No it's not just one of y'all, know you brought some boss bitches
Shake clap shake clap, shake clap shake clap
Shake clap shake clap, that's what I'm talking bout

[Hook - 2x]
You looking good girl, I'm trying to get with ya
Hustle me hustle me girl, you got some shit with ya
The way you shake clap shake clap, turn it around it for me
Shake clap shake clap, low to the ground for me

[C-Note]
Turn that ass round for me, make it shake clap
It's C-Note up in the club, I'm in this bitch strapped
Put the hood on the map, my pockets stay swoll
It's sho' cold, the way you sliding up and down that pole
Baby girl be on a stroll, don't try keeping up
Cause everytime she on the flo', the girl be cleaning up
Money they be sweeping up, the girl fine as hell
And every nigga in the club, be a clientele
Nigga I be high as hell, fuck what you niggas think
I'm in the club, trying to pimp the bitch for a bank
Doing what you niggas can't, cause I'm a big boss
Then shake it for me, like a nigga shake them laws off
Wanna see you take it off, but bitch I ain't a trick
But you sho' looking thick, we the Screwed Up Click
That's what we represent, you know we keep it hot
I see you blowing up the spot, I'm trying to check you out

[Hook - 2x]

[C-Note]
Just keep bouncing, keep shaking
All the hustlers in this bitch, money making
Just keep bouncing, keep shaking
All the thugs in this bitch, money making
Now shake it for me girl, and clap it for me girl
You know how it is, put that C-Note in your world
Now shake it for me girl, and clap it for me girl
You know what it is, put that C-Note in your world

[Troubledatruth]
I ain't never seen a dime piece, I ain't wan' try
I ain't never seen a bopper, that a dollar couldn't buy
Go on do your thang girl, I can't get enough honey
Shake clap shake clap, shake it like you love money
Tired of the scrubs, let a thug get you right mayn
Beat a piece of pussy, like it owe me from a dice game
Well put together bitch, I like the way you move
Some'ing special in the nude, you a mo'fucking fool I ain't lying to ya

[Hook - 2x]
