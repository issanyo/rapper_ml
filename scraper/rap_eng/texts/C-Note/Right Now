[Hook: C-Note]
Im way too high right now
So don't be killing my vibe right now
Im trying to have a good time right now
So don't be wasting my time right now
Why can't you just peep the sign right now
I got a lot on my mind right now
Im trying to make the world mine right now
Only limit is the sky right now, right now

[Verse 1: C-Note]
But im a push through it
Kind of a bad kid in school but was a good student
When it came to obstacles, I just footstooled it
Now you catch me flying through the clouds blowing kush through it
Oh man oh man
Went from zero
To a hundred thats why they call me C-Note
Trying to save the rap game become a hero
But I ain't telling you the plan that's the G-Code
No sir no sir
Im that
Soldier always prepared for combat
Feeling like the Terminator, cause Im back
Im so high you can't reach the contact
Yes Lord, yes Lord
Im blessed
I think you all should know that Im next
Everything I drop it shows progress
I think its time for me to kill the contest
Im way too high

[Hook]

[Verse 2: C-Note]
And I don't need no new friends
Only the real there ain't no pretend
Right now I got no regrets in this
Only cause I put my best in this
And all of my time been invested in this
And all of my grind been invested in this
And I could never give no less in this
That's how I know that I was destined for this
Aye
Pass me a dutch right now
Bout to roll up some ducks right now
Mix em in with some loud right now
Bout to be past the clouds right now
Yeah I feel like a star right now
Lets take a journey to Mars right now
I just feel like its time right now
To just make the world mines right now

[Hook]

[Outro: C-Note]
Right now right now
