[Intro]
Yeah man, it's your boy Lil B, you feel me

[Verse 1]
You can fuck my bitch, not the BasedGod's bitch
Might go to East Oakland and that dope fiend rental
Still got TVs with them four flats in it
I know the underworld, I was raised up in it
Might sell off your daughter if the price is right
Backdoor your family and take your life
Backdoor your wife, backdoor your kids
I'm the young pretty bitch, hoe you know what it is
In Castro Valley walking out that alley
Self made boss bitch take this pack
Nigga take this case cause I ain't gon' take it
I will not snitch, bitch I'll strip you naked
Call me Lil Boss with that XO bars
Saying fuck the Weeknd, I can't sing that soft (Figaro!)
I still know the struggle I get so jealous (Figaro!)
Still up in that good with that mini mansion
Mmm, pick which one
With that five tip of gun

[Hook]
A lot of suckers fake so I can't respect it
Fuck the Weeknd, put that on record
Still flash on bitches and I flash on niggas
One man army, it's the bitch mob, nigga
A lot of suckers fake so I can't respect it
Fuck the Weeknd, put that on record
Still flash on bitches and I flash on niggas
One man army, it's the bitch mob, nigga

[Verse 2]
A lot of niggas died and I felt that pain
Put a bitch down, I ain't saying no names
Ride around town in that all black gas mask
Niggas really love me, they'll fuck you in the ass
Ain't nothing funny with that can't stop money
Bitch mob over here, bitch mob get gully
I got that young nigga with that .45 body rock
Moi baby, brrrang-thang bitch mob
But I sell pussy and that cocaine burn
Flashing on bitches, loop hole that run
She love loop hole bitch check that money
Charging every groupie hoe ain't nothing funny
I'm not Santa, I'm not Martin
I really wanna know bitch how much you charging
I go out of state for that green count cutter
Charging every hoe, set up your mother
Yeah bitch set up your brother
Karma is a bitch so I took that smother
Everything I do got letters and numbers
L wanna creep tryna do something under
Word around town bitch mob, I'll smoother
Still selling Jerry like them Richmond stunters
In a Lexus coupe like my Richmond brothers
Knock a bitch out, I keep it one hunnid
Lil B

[Outro Hook]
A lot of suckers fake so I can't respect it
(It's all real man, I really feel this)
Fuck the Weeknd, put that on record
(Fuck with the kid baby, fuck with me, you know what I'm saying)
One man army, it's the bitch mob, nigga
(Every day man, for all these suckas, all that bullshit ain't gon fly
You know what I'm saying, I see you stealing swag)
Fuck the Weeknd, put that on record
(So it's cool, I'm coming [?] let that shit slide)
One man army, it's the bitch mob nigga
(I don't give a fuck if you singing, I don't give a fuck if you rapping
If you stealing swag, you stealing swag
Lil B, he changed the game with this shit
Like I said from the streets number one unsigned artist ever
One time for the one time
Like I said Lil B fuck with me
What's up world
Oakland what's up
West Oakland, East Oakland what's up
North Oakland what it do
Sacramento what it do)
