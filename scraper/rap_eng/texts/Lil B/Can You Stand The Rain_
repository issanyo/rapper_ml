You know we're sitting back....... Its for my ladies

[Verse 1]

Understand I live my life a real artist
Trashing this bullshit my parters out here starving
Looking for a woman from winter to August
That can understand that you build a friendship
Down for each other conservation flawless
And teach you what I know
Cuz the object is to grow
And I can think about all the times that I'm honest
I hold down the house and her heart is my fortress
Only if she ride, I'mma put her through some tests
And if she come back then I get a callback
Cuz in my life, a lot of baggage is extra
We can chill for hours
Jail taught me lessons
Sitting in the room, if your silent like that
Should respect my mind
Cuz theres knowledge up there
And I ain't playing when I say it
I rather keep it real than behind your back faking

[Verse 2]

Cash ain't shit
The heart rules everything
Your brain make it execute
Let me tell you something
Girl compatible with anything
Showed up regardless
We got a secret code that we speak in the morning
No I ain't had this but this a application
That goes through your speakers
Ladies check me out and pause for a second cuz the games looking tragic
I'm trying to have a wife before I even get married
You really peep my mind and you see I'm thinkg fast
I lost a lot of friends so relationships matter
And with it sometimes is the mission
And I dont't trust a human with those decisions
Especially with love, you lose that, you lose your vision
I try to keep my heart in the ocean with the fishes
If you feel that, it means that your based
And you understand my mind, let's go to space

[Verse 3]

A free agent
I came out of high school straight to the pros
Hooks no jump shots
Girls cheerleading
Fans on the benches
Sometimes after games live souls catch my image
I think they crazy, life, world, this shit is mean
That's why I need a lady to keep me in the field of daisies
To keep me home cuz the world hate me
100,000 let's get this money
