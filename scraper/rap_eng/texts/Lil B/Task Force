Welcome to the Task Force
Bitch Mob Worldwide
Lil B, welcome and enter the Task Force

[Verse 1]
Nigga this the task force are you ready to meet the lieutenant
I done hit 50 licks in the game about to jump up in it
Now it's like a scrimmage when you all up in that field
It gets real over the scrill, where them deals, them caps get peeled
Why you all up in my mouthpiece, trying to get something up out me
I done met bitches like you before, I treat them like a no no
Shouts out to Bitch Mob, young pretty boy killer
I see that pain up in your eye
But I chose to go out and ride
I'm holding on to that gizzon', for fizzon'
And protection, nigga tried to catch me slizippin'
Like the hitman out in Richmond
Holla on them streets when that Task Force on my mind
Bitch mob up on my mind
Lil B, I'mma go out and ride
Task Force no option
Pass to the back no Quarterback option
Buying from me no quarterback option
Might have to go out and drop 'em
Shouts out to Marvellous
Shouts out to Sacremento
I'll be smoking on that indo
Playing Nintendo, cause life's a game
In the Bay we be in a daze
Off that green and I'm all about grapes
Shouts out to East Ma Ma
Finna hit up KFC
Means Killing Fuckers Consistently
I'm my worst enemy
The only one that can beat me is Lil B
That's literally
Task Force keep it real with me
Bitch Mob gon' kill for me
Lil B that's the friend of me
You waiting out here for enemies
Move looking like a centipede
740 on top of shorty
Leave your ass with that 240
Shotgun with that "Oh Lordy!"
Bitch Mob, come Task Force me
Bitch Mob, come Task Force me
Bitch Mob, come Task Force me
Finna leave that pussy dripping you bitch
