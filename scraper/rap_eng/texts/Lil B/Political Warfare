[Intro]
Yeah, you know this is from my soul
I know a lot of y'all know I got a lot of problems
Yeah, they know they this music is perfect background, soundtrack for me
Whoever made this beat, you know it's for Lil B
You know I'm the realest
This my song nowâ€”this my song!
I'm the one in the streets! I'm the one that faced 36!

[Verse 1]
Ain't nobody care
That's why I'm sitting on top, I brought nobody there
With my gun in the lap and my bullet in stairs
Dip the hollow in the garlic
We get retarded
Don't laugh at me, you ain't gon' do shit for me
Like a lab test, you watching from the outside
You better come inside, I got shit for you
You come looking nice they gon' take that off you
I sort of feel like I was made in orbit
You can meet me at the top of the stairs, I'm talking 'bout heaven
Bring your binoculars there, the place where I'm from leave your vision impaired
When I go away, nobody gon' cry
Look me dead in the eye, I want nobody cryin'
Don't disrespect me because my music alive
Just keep it real, based to get through with the time
And I'm really from the hood, this is not just a rhyme
Three cellmates died, too young for the grind
Life is no different from mine, but they choose to go at particular times
Why they caught slippin'? Why they not livin'?
Why it's guns in the streets? Why they support killin'?
Why the hood got the drugs that'll send you to prison?
He ain't got a new house but he got new extensions
Put the clip in the back, load the bullets, and twist it
Made his brothers young killers, they on some sick shit
Gotta heal the people, that's my new mission
But don't nobody care, nobody won't listen
But everybody separated, nobody won't face it
If you wanna be real, stop tripping on races
'Cause the person that hate, they gon' be the one that save you
Treat another human like the person that raised you
I ain't gotta watch TV to have cable access
Walk right down the street, that was HBO
Dug drills on the block like 3.0
No scale, eyeball, it's a 3.0
Bitch say she love me, but you don't know me
Wolfpack to the end, bring it back, my friends
Now, I'm strapped at the house with the MAC, my friend
Now, I'm strapped at the house with the sack, my friend
And you know the game, bitch, I'm playing to win

[Outro]
I'ma knock you down, bitch
Obama BasedGod mixtape
Fuck this world, this me
If I wasn't from the streets, you wouldn't feel it
This my song!
Lil B
