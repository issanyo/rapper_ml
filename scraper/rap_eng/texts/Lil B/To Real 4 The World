[Verse: Lil B]
Shout out to Ronnie and Clyde, FedEx
Standing on the block I was serving them rap
I'm a hood cowboy I be strapped with the gat
Took losses, ain't nobody took more losses
I'm scared of the future 'cause i'm knowing what the cost is
Do I keep my head up, still I keep my bread up
It was a pistol in my face no need to be scared bruh
Judge a man off the things he been through
You ain't been through war, can't be a general
Why you trying to lead your people to hell
Ain't no test tube babies, our life is real
I grind at the night time, move at the night time
Turn into daylight, that's the graveyard grind
You have beef like monkeys in the jungle
Ain't have to pop bottles bitch I'm here to rumble
There's beef on the streets, you know I gotta eat
Rain, sleet, or snow I'll be here for a week
People try to speak and say that I'm weak but
You was on my joc trying to get me last week
Damn
The game too fake that's why I (?)
You gotta pay (?) to have your shit played
Huh, that's the promo deal
Now you're lost in the wave, you signed that promo deal

[Outro: Lil B]
Real shit
Fuck 'em
Its Lil B nigga
I'm too real for this rap shit
I'm too real for the world
