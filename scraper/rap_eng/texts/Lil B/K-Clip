Live from the bottom from the top motherfucker! Thats why I had to cough
On that one man, the air's so natural, let the motherfuckin chest breathe
We got new lungs, fresh money all that shit, like i said man shouts out DJ BasedGod man
The whole squad up, feel me, like i said this that motherfuckin Black Flame Mixtape man

Shouts out Marcy, you know what it do mane, New York, what it beee, you know shouts out to the err
Everybody from New York, everybody from the eastcoast

Verse 1:

Uh, You always had a plan but not like mine, played a slick game but not like I
You would take bits and pieces, who the real teacher, everybody know the truth
If you don't believe me, Let you come around, be around me, I'm one of none thats word to mom
The time switched up, i see you speaking, like the bottom feeder, or worse a leech

Really whats bad, is the world to see, nigga waste overtime thats word to God, While our ashes, blunt, shit
Fall on my leg, dont dust off, thats how i think about the haters, niggas fall back, test us, eat the two shots
Game run, pump lift em up the samee

*pause*

And this, shit, the shit dont change, nuttin, have a real wish without gun power, you gotta make a throne
Cause you gotta work long hours, come up the wall dont rope for cowards. Why am I hustlin'? Theres too much strugglin
Too many fake hustlers, in the projects with the customers, too many of em, too many motherfucking bustas

*Hook*

Fuck with this one, I pack the big gun, i be on defence, this is like high school, with the bullies, they be
Pickin on me, till i come with that 50 clip, till i come with that K-Clip

Fuck with this one, pack the handgun, i be on defence, this is like high school, with the bullies, they be
Pickin on me, till i come with that K-Clip or that 50

Fuck with this one, I pack the handgun, i be on defence, this is like high school, with the bullies, they be
Pickin on me, till i come with the K-Clips and the 50
