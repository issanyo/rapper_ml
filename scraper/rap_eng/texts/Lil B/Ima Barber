[Intro]
Yeah man, we poppin up everyday, baby
We doin what we want everday, baby

Pretty boys, yeah I said it
It's your boy Lil B, you feel me

[Verse 1]
I got a lot of hoes and I got a lot of dough
I don't like that bitch, that's a no no
Bitches fuck me cause she know I go slow
Fucked her in her mouth then I hit that woo woo
I got a lot of cash bitch, I got a lot of dough
Bitch don't like money, you better wife the ho
I'm looking for a down to earth bitch in the snow
I'm looking for a ride or die chick, you know

Fucking bitches daily, that's just how the game go
