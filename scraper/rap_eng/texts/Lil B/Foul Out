[Intro]
Yo, yo!
Welcome to the motherfucking court, man
We on this side, we on the right side
West side to the East side, South side to the North side
I'm seeing some beautiful girls in the place
We got the cheerleaders over there, we got the jocks right there
We doing everything we want, keep it based
Hoop Life mixtape!

[Hook](x2)
I fucked a cheerleader, I don't know what to do (x3)
Damn, bro, let me tell you!

[Verse 1]
I fucked a cheerleader and I made a mistake
Eyeballing me, I was playing the game
Don't ever think that I'm no lame
I won't stop playing, bitch, see me after the game
I asked her what she looking at
You see my 3-point, the team on my back?
Now, I want you on my back
Told her "holla at me", if she really 'bout that
Interview on ESPN
Basedworld, Lil B, BasedGod, thank you
I got the pussy next day, after we lost
Next day we won, bitch, of course

[Bridge]
The cheerleaders on my team wanna fuck me (x3)
Cause I'm getting money

[Hook](x2)
I fucked a cheerleader, I don't know what to do (x3)
Damn, bro, let me tell you!

[Bridge 2]
I fucked a cheerleader like this, I fucked a cheerleader like that (x2)
Girl, throw them pom-poms to the back (x4)

[Hook](x2)
I fucked a cheerleader, I don't know what to do (x3)
Damn, bro, let me tell you!

[Verse 2]
After the game, she wanna wait for me
She wanna fuck me, want a date with me
Bitch, you know I play for the team
Won't tell the coach that you fucking me
Rub my back that's lovely
Look at the girls, they love me
They love me
Look at the girls, they love me

[Bridge 3](x2)
I fucked a cheerleader in the butt (x3)
Man, BasedGod, that's enough!

[Outro]
Hold on, hold on!
Man, you 'bout to foul out, man!
You out here going crazy dude!
You need to calm all that down!
Hoop Life mixtape, we still out here
We still out here practicing, doing what we gotta do
All the cheerleaders love us

We doing our thing
Let's get it, we rocking!
