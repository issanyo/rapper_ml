Sometimes niggas be feelin like this the realest shit I ever wrote, but like, that's every fuckin rhyme
Rewind that shit all the way back

Gon ask cause these niggas move quicker man
I passed away, gunshots, had to pour liquor
Swear to god I had to cry, streamin tears like runnin rivers
No one understand when you're livin just for death
Motherfuckers try to play ya, fuckin stab your chest
It's why I had to start drinkin, always fuckin up my kidneys
But depression is a bitch, feel it when nobody thinkin
But I can't just be the dealer, I'm realer, feel me
I'm proving through my actions, showing that I'm above the pillar
My job is to make bread, but money equals killin
If you think about it, everybody's willin' to get a million
Motherfuckers pay the price over losing they children
But for positive a [??????] just be willin'
I can't stand to see them dead cold stairs and feelings [?]
I swear it's cold hearted but warm blood when you stealin
Death is a part of life, just get money, fuck a squealer
Feel me? And your odds is death, a ragin' bullet
But niggas passed away by the trigger
Now he's one in a million
So fuck death, you feel me?
How I still survive in your position?
How you gon survive talkin decisions?
Cause a nigga sittin
Man for real man them niggas don't even value friendship, shit
Ima do the business, makin money, shit
But when ya gettin up niggas, the people running and the streets is getting snitches man, golden like honey
I don't ask for help but I started askin for money
And the devil asked me, should I sleep with the thunder?
And the weather gettin gloomy man, looking like the booty
And the coochie started runnin, jealous of her boobies
Niggas, another, shot him, over some coochie
Fucked up, I can't believe this man, why he shootin man
Started with a joke, now he took it where he took it
Man you play both sides, but you can't dodge these bullets
Im a 10 star bitch, I'm guaranteed to fool ya
Ima guarantee what the fuck I do, what I say
And I'm cold on these streets, so Im strapped with a K
And I strapped with a 9, and Im strapped with the fire
And you know I'm comin in, cause you know I keep it real
Off that motherfuckin pill, bitch I show you what's the deal

I show you what's the deal, pussy
