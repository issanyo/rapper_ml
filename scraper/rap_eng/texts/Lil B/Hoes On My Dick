[Intro: Lil B]
Whoo, swag
Shouts out to Andy
Lil B BasedGod
Dirt Nasty on the beats

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Licorice necklace, I look like Madonna
Riding in my car and I looks like a Rasta
Shout out to Wolfpack mane, I look so gorgeous
When I got punched man, I got so cautious
New contract now I'm buying new Porsches
So many clothes, gotta walk-in closet

[Verse 2: Andy Milonakis]
Thirty-three dicks and my skin ain't porous
Three little bears and I serve them all the porridge
Hoes on my dick cause I look like a dead man
Hoes on my dick cause I treat em like a bed pan
Hit em with the left hand, get real creepy
Hoes on my dick when I make them real sleepy
Flow like BP, hoes on my pee-pee
Hubble telescope, but you still can't see me

[Interlude: Lil B]
Swag, swag Chef, cut, knife
BasedGod Berkeley, 100K, 100M

[Verse 3: Lil B]
Hoes on my dick cause I looks like Grandma
Damn BasedGod pinky ring like Santa
Hoes on my dick cause I looks like Fanta
Met a cool girl and her boyfriend's homeless
I'm so beautiful I look like Moses
I look like Fabio, young Ted Danson
Bitches on my dick cause I look like Marilyn Manson
I look like Bill Gates mixed with Obama

[Verse 4: Andy Milonakis]
Fuck little hoes in the mouth from the South
And the North, East West - I do it on the chest
Who's the muthafucka in the lime green vest
It's Lil B, YoungBased, Lil G, YoungFace
Fuck Diddy, Fuck Mase Fuck love, fuck hate
Clean and dope like heroin soap
Got hoes on my dick cause I look like the Pope

[Outro 1: Lil B]
Come suck Andy's dick bitch
Swag

[Outro 2: Andy Milonakis]
Contradictions man
Look that word up
No, seriously, look it up
