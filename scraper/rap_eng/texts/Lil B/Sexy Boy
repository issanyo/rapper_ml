[Verse 1: Shawn Michaels]

I think I'm cute
I know I'm sexy
I've got the looks
That drive the girls wild
I've got the moves, that really move 'em
I send chills up
Up and down their spines

[Hook: Shawn Michaels]

I'm just a sexy boy
Sexy boy
I'm not your boy toy
Boy toy
I'm just a sexy boy
Sexy boy
I'm not your boy toy
Boy toy

[Verse 2: Shawn Michaels]

I make 'em hot
I make 'em shiver
Their knees get weak
Whenever I'm around
They see me walk
They hear me talk
I make 'em feel
Like they're on cloud nine

[Hook: Shawn Michaels]

I'm just a sexy boy
Sexy boy
I'm not your boy toy
Boy toy
I'm just a sexy boy
Sexy boy
I'm not your boy toy
Boy toy
