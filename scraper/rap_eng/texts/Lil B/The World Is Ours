[Intro]
I can't see these niggas
I can't see these mothafuckas man
It's Lil B, man I don't wanna see 'em
Basedworld Paradise
Walkin' across this beautiful pavement
I love you people
I spit crack
I said "I love you" to the world, I'm talkin' to you

[Verse 1]
I spit crack, I don't play with you niggas' mics
I got swag, I don't write what you niggas write
Lil B man, I bang The Pack
And I get hella high with my brain intact
And you think I'm hella tacked but I'm on them racks
And you gotta watch cats that walk in black
Like Men in Black, with the pen at that
You see security, bitch, yeah my men is strapped
We don't play them games with them PS lames
I got a PS3, fuck a DVD
I'm a pimp, set trends, bitch you gon' see me
If you see a bad bitch, man she gon' see B
I don't freeze, I ski, capiche aqu√≠
On TV like Bill Cosby
I got bad money, super freak, it don't stop
I be fuckin' my cash for weeks, it don't stop
And I love my fans, and y'all love me back
And thanks for the fuckin' love, y'all hold me down
And for the jake cat niggas, y'all don't see me around
Hope you do a hollow tip, bitch you gon' see rounds
Beat your sucka ass up, bitch you gon' see rounds
Hot whip with the license down
And my car so clean, sit your feet down
Your chick want B? That's a cold beatdown
Every time you see me, I got Kobe rounds
I better give a death stroke like a homie round
I be spittin' bars, nigga you gotta hold me down
Wipe me down, I'm the king, bitch
I learn from two letters, only in my class
I am the best in ass
The way you address when you speakin' on the cash
While the bitch dresses, I'm freakin' on glass
Ice, bitch I shine bright like a crayon box
Not them neon lights
Look how deep I write
If I was broke, I would have to say my nigga is nice
And the world was in play, man I been on the Nikes
I set them trends, and I make them loans
First I start in the hood and I'm takin' off
Fuck you if you hate, niggas, cause the world is yours
The world is mine, the world is mine
The world is mine
I said the world is mine, the world is mine
The world is mine
I said the world is ours, the world is ours
The world is ours, the world is ours
The world is ours, the world is ours
The world is ours, it's all of ours
