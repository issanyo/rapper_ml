Intro:
Bitch Mob! We back with it
Respect Da Bitch Volume 1
This is your boy, Lil B
We're still cookin
Let's get it

Verse 1:
Walked in, and my swag's on a hundred thousand
Pay a bitch 10 to buy 20 thousand. fuck with me
Bitch, fuck with me because my swag's like Luther
Pink head band, and I'm looking like a shooter
Bitch Mob, nigga. Lil B, that's my partner
Got hella bitches, Hugh Hefner status
I'mma tote that chop 'til I'm looking like Regis
Chimmy Chang Chang, bitch, I know you can't believe this

Keep pushing 50
Bitches fuck with me
Hundred grand shows
I'm the pimp of the century
I'm going digital
I still spank my bitches

Just to be my friend
Everybody knows that I fuck with the Mexicans
Everybody knows that I'll fucking place your order
Young based god, I threw my swag in the water

Hook (X4)
Still cooking
Bitch, I'm still cooking
Still in the hood, and you know I'm still cooking

Verse 2:
Champ Bailey
Bitch, I'm Champ Bailey
Riding in the Benz, and I look like Carson Daly
Fucking three girls, I do that on the daily
I look so good that these hoes should just pay me
Bitch, I think I'm a stripper
Hundred grand shows, so you know I tote the pistol
Young based god, nigga, that WHOOP is official
All them young girls call me Trick Daddy, bitch
Spent ten grand just to drop on the six
Real deal, pretty boy. I'm in the building
If you're from the block, you know fuck they feelings
Hundred grand show, Lil B. I made a killing. (Okay!)
