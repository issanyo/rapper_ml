[Intro]
Yeah. Evil Red Flame nigga. This produced by Lil B. You feel me. Bay Area niggas stand up, we going dumb

[Verse]
If you riding high doing dangerous shit
Shotgun in the trunk with the fully automatics
Bitch talking shit I'ma give her wet willies
Put that nine in that ass and I made it go silly
Bitch play with me, ho it's young BasedGod
Bitch brang-thang-thang with the ching-chong-chang
Make a bitch flip like acrobatics
Bitch fuck with me, S550 with the limousine tent
Nigga mad at me
Bulletproof vest cause I think I'm the president
Bitch I stunt on bitches
30 karat ring like I'm Jesus bitch
Strip club throwing that money
Downtown fuck with these hoes
Riding through West Oakland then I hit Richmond
With my main bitch cause I'm out of pocket
Girl gave me 10 thousand to be her friend
Bet I give 'em... no, no
All my niggas go dumb [?]
Young BasedGod come with the 40
Young BasedGod got stroke like Robert Horry
Word around town I bought a Mac-11
And I bought a couple kush for the Christmas presents
East side nigga west side

[Chorus]
Real Oakland throw your hood up nigga
San Francisco niggas throw your hood up nigga
Pittsburgh niggas throw your hood up nigga
Marine City niggas throw your hood up nigga
Stockton niggas throw your hood up nigga
Hayward niggas throw your hood up nigga
Fourth of July bitch we all drink that liquor
Hanging out the car, we some wild ass niggas

[Interlude]
With the gun, backseat
Nigga act stupid
(We got guns, we got guns, We have guns, we have choppers. Guns)
I said you act stupid nigga, we got guns in the backseat. All my niggas positive though

[Chorus]
Oakland throw your hood up nigga
Berkeley niggas throw your hood up nigga
[?] niggas throw your hood up nigga
Sacramento niggas throw your hood up nigga
Fairfield niggas throw your hood up nigga
Uh, throw that hood up nigga
Nigga claim throw your hood up nigga
If you bang the mob throw your hood up nigga
If you claim waterfront throw your hood up nigga
If you a based boy throw your hood up nigga

[Outro]
