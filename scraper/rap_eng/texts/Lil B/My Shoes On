[Intro]
We getting money [?]
What you niggas wanna do?
[?]
Options
Yeah beautiful day today
Relaxing, chilling outside

[Verse]
I'm back with my life on the line now
It's so real, can't cry now
Crying inside, the fire won't die down
My life like ten tracks
I'm trying to sign now
Niggas know I got the stains out now
Stop trying now
Searching inside for the diamonds
Don't lie to them
I'm just living, feel me
This my vision
I'm in the game, all I know is pain
Why the fuck did you say those things?
Trading off diamonds, staying all the same
A hundred hours, that ain't a thing
Switched up, take a couple pics
Realize I made it bitch
I need a lot of help, so sick
I ain't crazy my nigga, I'm just living shit
Where you wanna go?
Living on a island and we on the boat
I'm here, right here
I'm in the lane, right gear
Swipe there, right there
Platinum black hole [?]
This is my name
All I got is game
Switching lanes and you're playing games
All we got in common man we in this place

Got my shoes on
Tie you up man, shoes on
(Lace you up man)

[Outro]
It's Options man
I don't think they fuck with me
Rawest rapper alive man, it's Lil B
