They say your boy changed
But ya dude got game
This for my niggas, I'm a silent man
I hold the torch, I hold the crown

Triple X porn star in the making
This shit took a while

And they throw it in my face
'Cause a nigga never had it
So fuck it I'ma snatch it
[?] the lost boys lookin' ratchet
Yeah bitch, let it burn no ashes
Yo bitch gon' love me when the light on
I'm just tellin' real thoughts
Woke up to the Basedworld
Where nothin' what it seems
Where the days are still dreams
Where the fiends are real fiends
Ski mask fiends
Just get the cream, fast cream
If you really want the real
I'm right here just ask me

[Interlude 1]
Shouts out to all my niggas man
Everybody I love, my family
Understand I love you

[Verse 2]
Bitch I should've been rich
We know and she know

Young Berkeley boy
I was bossin' for a [?]
Don't change the game
But the game done switched
Niggas gettin' mad 'cause they bitch suck dick
I don't even trip
Go ahead bitch
I raised myself
My mom did her best
No Nikes but I'm countin' all checks
Got F's in school
But I was the smartest dude in the class
I don't need school
My life was realer anyway
I plead the fifth bitch
I'm ready for it any day
A small nigga wit' a big head
I wanna learn the past
But that pain I did
I stared it in the face
How do bosses do it?
Like Yo Gotti
It's that cocaine music

[Interlude 2]
And because of that
Young L on the beat because of that
Without him I wouldn't be shit
Shouts out to Young L

Thank you god

[Verse 3]
I should've died when I was 14
Or 15 or 16
Or 17
18, I'm here now Mama forget the drama
I take whatever sentence
Shit it's just a colder honor
With anything you do
Shit you gotta pay the promise
I looked the honor in his eyes with my partner's mama
Like 36 ain't shit
I'm grown my dreads [?]
This legal shit is sucker shit
I'm [?] off some other shit

[Interlude 3]
And that's when I really changed my life
I sat down and I said
With everything you do man
There's an opposite
There's an action and a reaction man
I plan to be proactive instead of reactive, you feel me?
Change my life up
That's when I seen the light
And I changed my life, you feel me?
And now I'm here man, I'm focused man
All my niggas you could really do it
Know what I'm sayin' man, welcome

[Verse 4]
I love y'all for fuckin' with me man
God bless y'all bodies
And if you got a bad bitch
Let her caress your body

Pretty face, long dick up on a bitch

And if you wanna ask me
Shit I'm from the Waterfront
