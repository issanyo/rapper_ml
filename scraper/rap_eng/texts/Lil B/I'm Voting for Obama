[Intro]
Yeah, it's your boy Lil B
You know what I'm sayin'?
That based knowledge, that based college
Freestyle, you know what I'm sayin'? For the opera

[Chorus]
Man, I'm votin' for Barack Obama, go Barack O
You know what I'm sayin'? It's time for a change
I'm votin' for Obama, I said I'm votin' for Obama
I said I'm votin' for Obama

[Verse 1]
I'm votin' for Obama 'cause I want the change
I relate to him, relate in those ways
I watched him on TV, he grew from the struggle
Everybody understands the struggle
He hustled, so hard, he hustled
Freestyle, freestyle, no muscle
Yeah, he talks with no muzzle and I respect that
You know what I'm sayin'?
And I respect his manhood, how he carries his self
When everybody else tried to break him
Everybody else tried to push him
He falled back, he don't even need the cushion
And I know it's gonna be his first time bein' president
And he might make some mistakes
But that's gon' come real good
Because he's gon' make the change for the world
And bring us out the hood

[Chorus]
I'm votin' for Barack Obama
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm votin' for Obama
I'm votin' for Obama, I said I'm votin' for Obama
Said I'm votin' for Obama
Based freestyle for the drama

[Verse 2]
Man, it's gon' change
And I don't got nothin' against John McCain
But when I watched him on TV, I don't really feel him
No connection, man, I don't even feel him
I sometimes, man I can't even hear him
And I listen, the spiritual not with him, man
But when I see Barack Obama
I see his smile, integrity and honesty
I respect that, go Barack O
I, I, I respect that
And I respect your mind and I respect your heart
That's gon' be for the grind
Lead the nation, lead the city
Based boys behind you, WolfPack city
You know what I'm sayin'? Based God behind you
BasedLord in this day, man, time will find you

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm votin' for Obama
I'm votin' for Obama
I said I'm votin' for Obama
For Obama
Said I'm votin' for Obama
I said I'm votin' for Obama
Said I'm votin' for Obama
Yeah, I said I'm votin' for Obama

[Verse 3]
I said I'm votin' for Obama
Because he got the thing that could bring us back
From the bottom of the rug to the top of the rug
For the top with no grudge
And I don't care if I'm gettin' taxed by Obama
Shit, he's gon' bring somethin' back
And I believe it, man, I believe he can do it
The first Black president, that's a big thing
We're all a part of history, God bless history
It's not even on no racist stuff, you feel me?
But Barack O needs to be president
I promise that, man, he needs to be president
And if y'all got someone better
Then put him on there, bitch and show me somethin' better, nigga
Sorry for cussin'
But I just felt that discussion was very passionate to me
So when I say I'm votin' for Barack Obama actually

[Chorus]
I'm votin' for Obama
Yeah, I said I'm votin' for Obama
Yeah, I said I'm votin' for Obama
Yeah, I said I'm votin' for Obama
I'm votin' for Obama
Lil B votin' for Obama
Lil B votin' for Obama
I don't even want none the drama

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin'?
I made this based freestyle, man
Top of the head, top of the dome, man
'Cause it's somethin' that's important to me, man
You know what I'm sayin'?
Everybody put their votes in for Obama
