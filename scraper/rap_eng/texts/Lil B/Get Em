The goons gon get em
Get em

[VERSE 1]
These niggas playin games the ak knock their head across
It's shotguns in the back, mac 11s in the front
These niggas tell me chill but they don't know who they be playing with
Playing with my patience, a real killer's never anxious
I got them waiting

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2]
Now I serve it to em, I'm too hot
These niggas owe me favours and they down to make it pop
I'm a cool nigga but I had to make it stop
Leave you fucking broke, up in your spot
Bitch

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
Niggas hating on me cos I'm steady hustling
Punch me in my face and I ain't even do nothing
Now I'm on aks and I'm strapped and I'm cussing
Taking blunts to the face and I'm feeling like it's nothing
Basedgod
Waterfront

[HOOK]

[VERSE 4]
Trust no bitch I'm a cold one, igloo
Niggas stay playing and they know who done did it
Know who be playing, know I ain't talking
Fuck a handshake bitch, suckers taking losses

[HOOK]

[VERSE 5]
Bruh you try to play me that's a no no, oh no
Now I'm doing bad and I'm also positive
Now I'm toting ks with them 4-5 extenders
Aiming like duck hunter when I play nintendo
Nigga, Basedgod, bitch
