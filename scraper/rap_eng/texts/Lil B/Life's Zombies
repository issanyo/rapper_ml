[Intro]
There's so many zombies
Fuck man, we gotta go
I-I just gotta go
I got-I-I can't get away from this
So many vampires
Just dealing with these
Inner and outside demons, they just won't leave us

[Verse 1]
Dead zombies
Clips with the handguns
Red herb, blue herbs, green herbs
Follow me into the room
Another puzzle
Now I'm feeling doomed
Who this boss is?
I'm shootin' shotgun'
Reload
Can't see through the darkness
Scarecrows
Walk down the stairs
Niggas is hatin'
Experience
Audience
Perhaps you'll help
If you ain't
Nothing else
Every situation you look
Fear in it's eyes
Life's puzzles
Re-routing the game when you're 25
Yes it's still, with my team collecting items
Need a flashlight to get inside it
Break through the windows
Go through the sewers
It's monumental (yes)
My senses
Money back
Trying to save my life
Running to the right
Searching all my life

[Hook]
Resident Evil, I'm loading up my handgun, for all these life zombies
Resident Evil, I'm loading up my handgun, for all these life zombies
Resident Evil, I'm loading up my handgun, for all these life zombies
(just trying to live my life in peace)
Resident Evil, I'm loading up my handgun, for all these life zombies

[Verse 2]
Let me
Monetize it
The zombies are
Burning
Buildings
Feel like I'm trapped in with people trying to kill us
Meet success like a boss, disaster with honor
Got a high rank because I'm honest
Care about my partners
I got medicine if you need to mix it
This blood mansion
Can't forget your street life if you never lived it
Keep your mind at success
And lastly
Disaster ain't the end of the road
Your last breath, take it with love
As you exit the palace, I'm mixing herbs trying to save you
But the fate is faceless
Ignorance and confidence, it's the Ying and the Yang
Load the pistol up, I'm on the battlefield
Victory is half of the pain
It's all-over the city
I can see it in they faces
Dead zombies in the hood from separation
Guarantee the nation, no
Guarantee they play this
Start the game over

[Hook]
