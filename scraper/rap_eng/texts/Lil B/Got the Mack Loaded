[Intro: Lil B]
Yeah
You feel me?
This that Red Flame baby
Devil Music
This don't sound too evil, don't it?
Uh

[Verse 1: Lil B]
The battlegrounds are never found
The silence that don't wanna leave
That come around
You never scared, you never found
We ridin' round with the chopper
In the backseat
Money in the backseat
Thoughts on our mind
Phew
Uh
Let these niggas know that it's not sweet
Gats in our hand that show these suckers due then done got meet
Why you play Lil B?
Now you finna go to sleep
Guaranteed he paid back
Remember me from way back?
Yeah Summer, he a cat
Never know who change that
Now it's time to meet to the maker
You arranged that
Dressed in all black
I rolled on 'em like a Maybach
Face-to-face, bullets, ammunition give 'em playback
If you can't hear that
Please have 'em lit back
After all that
Take 'em
And get his grip back
I'mma lay him down up in the coffin like a Kit-Kat
Lay his ass down, no speaking, no chit-chat
Turn me to a killer
Never thought I would go back

[Verse 2: Lil B]
I never thought I would go back
Yeah
Uh
Chest, arm
Right arm, left arm
Neck gone
Teflon, vest on
Still alive
The best one
Leave cats some
Shotgun
His head's sprung
Head gone
You laying on the ground
Banging next one
With your friends
You would've thought you regret some
Now I know the cops know I'm leaving
Blood
Everywhere I go
Mask up or no mask
Heh
In a conflict the giant's spit
Play me like a fool again
I show 'em how Saddam sits
Huh-ha
Nigga I show you how this bomb sits
Two eleven your mom bitch
Yeah
Check this
I can hit 'em a little harder
Play the game a little smarter
Watching through the curtains
Nigga pistol by the water
Grenades up in the couches
And suckas praying for tomorrow
Fuck going hidin' I'm thuggin' and you know it
Jeans stay coated
Niggas ain't notice
I took the game over
Rain, sleet, snow'd it
Suckas stay knowing
And I got the marks loaded

[Outro: Lil B]
Nigga I got the mack loaded nigga
Red Flame Devil Music
Let's rock bitch
