[Intro]
Yeah, come over here
Come over here and check me out; Red Flame
Chillin' in New York, in the subway
Finna go relax
Probably turn on my Sega Genesis, know what I mean?
Got my L.A. gears on
It's night time in the coffee shop, king
Yeah, shouts out to all the Latin community
The whole Latin, Español
It's ya boy, Lil B

[Verse 1]
As I receive my gifts, no wintertime
Thank god I'm eatin', boy; no dinnertime
Rap god with the lines like Walmart
Don't need awards, just make sure you give me mine
I don't get on a lot of people songs
'Cause they don't understand that I did it this long
Based God, I done traveled so far
Lil B, nigga, I done met GOD
Red Flame like godfather eatin' pasta
In New York by yourself in the wintertime
Home Alone 2 on VHS, Sega Genesis
Charlie Brown, Power Ranger movie on cable access
Game Genie all a part of my success, yeah
And I don't treat, nigga, you can deep-dish
New York subway in the big city
BasedWorld for life

[Outro]
Goddamn, gotta catch this train
'Bout to run downstairs
Man, New York looks so beautiful right now
Feel so grown sittin' in this restaurant, lookin' outside
All these cars goin' by
New York in the wintertime is such a beautiful place
Lil B
Shouts out to every latin person on earth
Cómo se dice en español, "I love Spanish"?
Cómo se dice en español, "I love the world"?
Cómo se dice en español, "Lil B is the shit, bitch"?
That's what the fuck you should say
Red Flame, nigga
