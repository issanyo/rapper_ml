[Verse 1]
Bitch I ain't never been a fucking lick
Even with a young nigga I was still with this shit
The Brrrangdangdangs and the ching chong clips
Bitch wanna fuck she gon' get the long dick
Got too much money, I ain't got the time
Nigga try to extort me I'mma pull out the 9
Nigga Superman the Glock made him fly
One day he on Earth next day he in the Sky
Bitch I ain't never been a fucking lick
Fuck nigga wanna plot, fuck nigga getting killed
That's on my fucking daddy put a nigga in a caddy
38 rounds, down to suck it like a faggot
Niggas wanna play, got the game fucked up
Think it's in a movie 'til he get his tape cut up
Really bitch, think that ya tough?
Real in the field whoadie get is head bust
ASAP bitch I be down with the mac
Like a lesbian, nigga I been down with the strap
Full extentions like the girls with the braids
Nigga westside couldn't hold me in the cage
Now I love this freedom

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Nigga ask me what size is my shoes
Bitch nigga man I might just have to kill you
Everybody cheerleading cause we catching bodies
Nigga looking like boy I know he's shady

Drop the 8 in the front cuz it gets shady

Nigga comment on my clothes that I wear

Raise hell in a cell we blowing up again!
