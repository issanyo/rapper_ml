[Intro]
Just for now, just for now, just for now
Just for now, just for now, just for now
It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
If just for a little while
Lil B, Based God

[Verse]
King of rap, I can bet my money on that
Can't face the facts that a young guy killin' shit
Give me another shot and I'mma come with my mask on
Seen a lot of growth since I came with the Vans song
Now it's '09 and I'm runnin' with the Based God
Fire in my eyes, mix my soul with the napalm
Mix and master, all I need is dro and one mic
One pad, one pen, iPod, dim lights
Feelin' like a plane when it's up and it's in flight
Dressing everyday like I'm dead with the pinstripe
This a few things that show that I'm the rawest
Spend the cash everyday so I'm ballin like Spalding
Want beef, like six Iâ€™ll have you baldin' like Baldwin
Your favorite rapper out, I'mma lay 'em in a coffin
No talkin' when I'm talkin', cause it's legend, pay attention
Only time I sat in class was when I'm serving a detention
I fucks with Soulja Boy, get money nigga
Everytime I see a rapper, I think that I'm a get him
In the booth or in the streets, I'm known to tear and rip 'em
15 and 16, eyes breaking down the system
Nobody can tell me nothing, I was livin off my system
Head fucked up, I thought it would be cool to go to prison
Watching Hot Boyz on BET, getting all these women
So I got my gold grill because I'm thugged out with 'em
B-Town, Waterfront I put on for my city
We done did it for 6 years, just reached 20
A lot of dudes I grew up with didn't see 20
Everytime I have a birthday, I'm thinking God love me
Everytime I hit the beat, man I do it for my Mom
Workin' hard everyday I'mma make it where it's mine
I'mma hustle all the time, like Lil' Wayne do
If you' ever up against me, you get ate like grapefruit
My first reaction was like, just chill and stay cool
The rap game is slow and it just ain't cool
Always jockin all my style and it just ain't you
Only time I feel you, is if a based boy do
Because I'm a rap god and a based boy too
I can listen to the hate and put the volume on mute
So the only thing I hear is the horses in the coupe
And when the roof go down it reminds me of my chick
Getting money off the floor because "I'm trapping like a bitch"
Like Gucci Mane said but it's rich nigga clique
And my name is Lil B, you can call me king of rap
I done did a few things and I'm never goin back
Mirror mirror on the wall, shit, I'm askin who the man is
Lil B for Lil Boss I'm prayin to my canvas
I deserve the crown because I'm speakin for the masses
And I'm into weed, I'm gettin chiefy like Kansas
Words to the wise, you should fear the competition
Because I'm the only vet that's a Based God spittin
And you ain't in the game until you make a thousand songs
And you dyin' for this rap, because it's the only thing you love
