[Intro]
(Oh my God Keyboard, you're so based)
*Options* the mixtape, it's your boy Lil B
Shout out Keyboard Kid, I see you
These niggas don't know

[Verse]
I wave goodbye, I'm going out again
My childhood yeah I got toys but I ain't playing bitch
All we do is grow, fuck the experiments
Still digging deep for the motherfucking clearance
Still [?] my mind, don't get near me
Like a sponge investigate it clearly
Birds in the roof, weed in the Chevy
Praying to God that I just stay ready
Moving my heart while others stay touring the world
I'm buying guns, smoking heavy
Playing Madden, metaphor
I'm serving sacks
Customers in and out like
I plead the fifth I ain't had a sack since six
It makes sense I move bags and bricks
Every day Halloween, I got a mask and a grip
I'm feeling like a pimp, I got the mac and the bitch
Metaphor I'm the mac and the bitch
Metaphor I'm a hoe and a pimp
Dark shades, throw them vibes away
Metaphor I'm on to brighter things
I see them brighter dreams
But how can I see at night through this dark light
It's Lil Boss

[Chorus]
I really bleed the shit
Plead the fifth all day and I ain't seen the shit
You really need the bitch?
Fuck that, we gon' leave the bitch
I bleed the shit, I really bleed the shit
Plead the fifth all day and I ain't seen the shit
I don't need the bitch
We gon' leave the bitch
I really bleed the shit
Plead the fifth all day and I ain't seen the shit
I don't really need the bitch
But I can leave the bitch

[Outro]
