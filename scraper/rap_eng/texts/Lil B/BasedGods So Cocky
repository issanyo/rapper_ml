[Intro: Lil B]
(You feel me? Shout out man
I don't give a fuck about anything)
I'm a young gun and I don't even push right
But i'm leaning on the stove making like I cook rock
Now bitch ask me "what the fuck?"
Bitch shut the fuck __

[Verse 1: Lil B]
I'm a bay nigga
I be going dumb
2012 nigga and i'm still done
Got Rossi in the hand cause i'm still drunk
Bitch ask me "what the fuck I want?"
Hoe I want __
Bitch I want myself on a sex tape
Bitch over here man, I ain't fucking with ya
Bitch fuck the whole bar and come fuck me
Bitch I has four cards out
Its Based God hoe, I bring the hoes out
Feel me? Fuck with me bitch
Gold House Bitch Mob suck my fucking dick bitch
Based God
