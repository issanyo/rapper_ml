[Verse 1]
Hello...
Running around, acting like you’re shit don’t stink
Every time we going some you blame it all on me
Trying to make yourself look good
Shut get u one more time spend every time
Now I’m feeling like I’m wasting time
I’ve been confused I think like thugs
Girl i thank you check your attitude

[Chorus]
You trippin
You trippin
You trippin
You trippin
What happened to the girl i used to know right now
You trippin
You trippin
You trippin
You trippin
So this is how you treating me of all the good things I’ve done for your ass

[Verse 2]
Every time I come around your girlfriends got something to say
Like i would really care I ain’t fucking them anyway
Call your phone I get no answers get sent straight to voicemail
Got me so mad while I’m texting I’m cursing you
Calling you names like more chestnut
Two complain at game girl

[Chorus]
You trippin
You trippin
You trippin
You trippin
What happened to the girl i used to know right now
You trippin
You trippin
You trippin
You trippin
So this is how you treating me of all the good things I’ve done for your ass

[Verse 3]
Guess you found out about me and yeah you know who
Talking about Crystal and everything you heard about is true
Oh how can I sleep with when your friends and your crew
Oh this is just some payback to get back at you

[Chorus]
You trippin
You trippin
You trippin
You trippin
What happened to the girl i used to know right now
You trippin
You trippin
You trippin
You trippin
So this is how you treating me of all the good things I’ve done for your ass
