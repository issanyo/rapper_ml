[Intro]
Thugged Out Pissed Off welcome to history, you feel me. Welcome to the emotions. This is rare art. This Lil B. I know Lil Boss. Flexin' on the under, you know what I'm saying. Feel this pain man. I'm going sick man

[Verse]
If you got honor, you can get sprayed jack
Bitches walk by, now you giving play back
Same bitches hating broke with kids now
Nothing wrong with that, you might birth a legend
I'm looking at you bitches, I could buy y'all pussy
I used to be a square but that gangsta in me
Skinny nigga raised in a dangerous city
Stray bullets might hit you if you in the wrong spot
Now my stash spot in the wall and the ceiling
Smoke the pain away, I ain't got no feelings
Numb to the pain, I ain't got no feelings
Producer is a bitch he made this beat sound gay
I made it sound tight cause I'm Lil B
I made it sound right cause I'm Lil B
I don't give a fuck about this breakdown nigga
Cause I double up and tax y'all niggas

[Verse 2]
How you gon cop when you ain't got mula
I rock the judge and hit 'em with bullets
Tryna judge me, I fuck y'all pussy
I'ma fuck the lawyer cause they lyin' on me
Do your friends sit down for ya
I don't trust niggas so I hit licks solo
I'm Lil B until I'm done for
I'm not scared of death, you just helping me
We ridin' in the streets cause we do this
I ain't goin outside, I'ma slide on that bitch
I'ma do me until I'm sleepin in piss
Do I even exist
