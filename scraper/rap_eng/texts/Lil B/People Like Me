[Verse 1: Lil B]
I be seeing shit in the hood
But all rules in the hood
Make the hood no good
How you raise ya daughter in the hood
Round these cut throat killers
No love for your neighbor
No love for niggas
Barely got they feet on
Cause they fuck with niggas
I coulda been up with these niggas
But that's the mindset like these other niggas
I get money, fuck that, that's the same shit
I give rap dope, i wanna change but you niggas
Keep saying theirs no hope, heal the hood
Start from the scope
I'ma start in the east
Nigga i'ma clean up the trash
East Oakland California
I'ma pick up the trash
Make the enviroment a place to last
I don't want kids walking around
All that trash
Want more community love
From the bottom to the top
Finna heal Oakland
I love the block
You gone see me post it, positively posted
With the mindset
Nigga i'm gone help this place in Oakland
The only place i see people out in the morning
Crackheads selling pussy
At the top of the morning
I don't like to say this
But i gotta inform them
How can their be so much pain
So close to the ocean?
Gotta meet the mayor and the governor
Gotta make sure the police is protecting ya
And make sure they not arresting ya
Don't trip if you gotta
Correct your gesture up
But i still love this place called America
Then show love to the hater bitches
And tell these niggas
Wishing all that shits vicious
Can't fuck with these scandalous niggas
Sit back and count money
And mind my business
Shout out to Berkeley, California
We need to stop the violence
And just keep the peace
Waterfront nigga i keep the piece
Catch me on the nine when im in these streets
Shout out to Richmond, California
I love you and i got you too
Watching the people in it, i love you more
I appreciate the blessings you gave me
Real nigga clicked up,I was destined to spray em
Lotta niggas wanna talk, suggest as i'm saying
What they wanna do?
What you gotta do?
What you can do and what you can't do
Ya feel me, i'm just trying to put you on game
This is top of the dome, ya feel me?
Niggas stood back when i was rocking it home
Niggas stood back man, nigga i'm watching the throne
Reflexing ya thoughts, passing his thoughts
Passion starts moving apart
Grove block nigga, taking it apart
Catch me in the zone at the end of the park
End zone park, the rims so dark
Bitches on my back, man they coked up
Don't smoke up, i'm feeling like Jehova
Based god, Based god, hustler hustler
I'm still in the streets nigga, i'ma fuck ya
Yea and i'ma get ya, this is war
I won't touch ya but i gotta get you for myself
The beef much better, wearing Bill Cosby sweaters
Trying to get you now or never
This is us forever
Whole block, i'm saving you niggas

[Hook: Lil B]
