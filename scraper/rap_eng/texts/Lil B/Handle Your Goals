Oh no what’s this
Don’t act like you frontin on the kid
Caught in the middle
You faking on the kid Lil B
How you going to front on me Lil Boss
I been the one that been fucking with you from the jungle
How you going to fake on the kid
How you ain’t going to put me on Lil B
Whats up with that I expect that from you
Yea I expect that from you I expect that
So you got to do that and I ain’t fucking with you
If you don’t this is how I feel

[Verse1]
Here you go again talking things you don’t know about
Check this out i'm a keep rapping
Check this out all this tough talk and you really soft
You really ain’t God you really you really souls lost
I really think you trippin really ego trippin
You need to slow it down flying with the scenes
Egos slipping use to be in the dungeon
Two face no position no constitution we check this out
I’m shady the real too use to sell weed
Just to eat my sorrow keep
Grown man any situation is unique
So any body hating is really nothing
You never been humiliated in public
I seen so many things how could I not love it
I been in pain the worst way never celebrate
Birthdays or holidays

[Hook]
Oh no what’s this
Is there a web and I’m caught in the middle
They caught up
So I turn to oh no
So I turn to Lil B man

Ya’ll just doing everything out here for your selves
Don’t care about nobody Lil B
You suppose to be able to put me up
When you had the chance

[Verse2]

Got me thinking about a homicide yea
I eat my greens I stay connected with the roots
Serving fenes out the window of roof
I need more help so the teacher can give
But if you don’t listen who really living
I’m still holdin I’m still thinking about capital
I am still about that right side what the fuck the right side
I use to hide out in bundles of freeway
I feel like a gun I’m just a doorway
My stomach getting hungry I’m thinking this way
My niggers run clubs and magazine
Because I’m thinner have a talk with the Gods
Thinking how far my life been
Thought I was crazy so ackward
But I get it now you just got to learn to figure out
Lil B yea

[Hook]
Oh no what’s this
I get it Lil B you don’t have to trip
Far away and I’m caught in the middle
Do what you got to do
I see thugs pissed off working
Once you in that right position I know you
Going to do what you got to do for everybody
Keep pushing man handle your goals
Its Lil Boss
Far away and I’m caught in the middle
So I turn to
