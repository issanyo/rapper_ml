[Intro]
Welcome to Angels Exodus
It's your boy Lil B
Ending of 2010
Welcome 2011
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Lord, whoever, thank you for this weather
Blessings for today and praises to whoever
Legends like me I don't be going out the gym
In-house maids, marble-floors
Sea done cease to transfer passengers
Across states and boundaries got lines
Over time I put in for this rap like I'm UPS
Niggas is gifted; I appreciate the talent I was given
But at times I don't
And I'm wondering why I'm living, my sun-blocked vision
While I exhale the smoke
How many niggas laid in horror?
Feared for they life?
Welcome morning
Cheers to the night
And fresh thought: we gon' be alright
Fight the battle of a champ
Pride myself on honour
Niggas be going to jail for karma
Master of wisdom
Don't be misled by the knowledge
Life college, Lil B, Angels Exodus

[Interlude]
I feel good because this is a growth for me
And this is steps up
I ain't going backwards
I'm moving forwards
Remember: don't mistake knowledge for wisdom
Real rappers know that shit
This has passed rap; this is real life

[Verse 2]
Save myself
I paid myself
Niggas act hard, but I raised myself
I did a good job for the hand I was dealt
Had a crazy Mom; she took her hand to the belt
And the father used to beat her so the violence passed down
Niggas say that greed is what's making the cash cow
I never gave a fuck, never wearing the mask down
God punished me, I was having to back down
Had to slow down because I'm moving too fast now
Had to rethink because my planning is so average
Had to step it up because my vision was messing up
Gave my man purpose and the pressure to mess it up
Now I'm on a roll and my focus no hocus pocus
Now I know the light in my passion is so ferocious
Now I'm on the plane and I'm giving the staff promotions
Now I'm on the place and I'm touring the out and the open
Lil B
