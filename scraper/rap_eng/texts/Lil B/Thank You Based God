Lil B

[Verse 1]
Welcome back, Based God; massive attack
Thank you for
Blessin' me with the present, in fact
Actually
How you rap makes the people react
I ain't seen it in a while, you a legend in flesh
Even to how you dress makes the silents guess
I ain't never wore a Guess, bitch I know what I want
Five-somethin' short dude with the presence of Dr. King
Ask about the boss from the summer to spring
They'll tell you that my name mean more than the phrase
I'm more than a game
And I kept on the fame
And I really been true, shit, like a counsellor
That's how I used to be, with the devilish stares
Quickly; that turned to the moment I'm in
Because I can't sit in jail, that was never my friend
Ask if I go back? I say "never again"
Lil B in handcuffs, livin' life is a sin
I'm Black Ken

[Interlude]
Shit, my life is a dream
I'm still a king
Lil B

[Verse 2]
Most of it's bullshit
I don't relate to your foolishness
I'd rather deal with trendsetters
Man, I'm lookin' at my rap; now I'm proactive
Started writin' on a paper, changed my whole status
Bad bitches suck my dick now; no askin'
So fresh, goddamn I'm a closed casket
Anybody wanna know how I got it?
Switched my game up from a legend to a prophet
Stepped my guns up from a 40 to a rocket
The type of ammo that blow the cords out your socket
The type of new money you ain't puttin' in your wallet
I done seen the kind of cash you can't put it in your pocket
And I ain't with the secrets man, I let you know your option, man
Here's a guess: eighty percent of these bitches boppin', and
About twenty percent of 'em is your partners
The other half of 'em is imposters
Black Ken the opera, nigga

It's a mohfuckin' rap, nigga
Black Ken, man my life is a daze
Lil B, man I don't do it for the fame
I just want them to know my name
Get me out of here, it's all a dream; Black Ken
Get me out of here, it's all a dream; black ken
