[Intro]
This that Black Flame Mixtape
And I did this for the ladies all across the room and the world
Barangdang, yeah
Like I said, uh

[Hook]
Ms. Woman, Ms. Woman
I wanna tell you, "You so special,"
A lot of women on earth
You are unique

[Verse 1]
Summertime or wintertime
How you make us feel--this so real
How I met her--a partner
She feel like family
I could tell her anything
And it's all good
I know a lot of girls worry about that outside looks
But real talk
It don't even matter how you look
You was born beautiful trying to be all natural
If you wear a weave: don't trip
It's classy, though
Fuck expectations, live your life, girl
I promise you a queen, execs and knights
One time, one talk, that's on life
I got your back for life, stacked for life
Stack your mind, now don't put a price
Cause you worth more than they trying to buy
And I'm one of those kind of guys:
Smooth, low-key, laid-back, kindly guys
And I wanted to make a song so the girls could vibe
And ride out to this with that classic ride

[Interlude]
Ride, go ahead and vibe, one time for the twenty times
Feel like a beautiful day on the summer day breeze
Sit back with they hair blowing through the trees

[Hook]
Ms. Woman, Ms. Woman
I wanna tell you why you so special
A lotta women on earth
You are unique

[Verse 2]
I seen her at the bus stop, I'm driving by
She look down, listening to her iPod
I wanna say, "Have a good day today,"
Girls around the world deserve to be happy
You deserve the best if you got love in your heart
You deserve a check
If you play games, then we can play some chess
But please don't take those dangerous steps
You girls are so great, I had to change my steps
Brought the Zagato Coupe just for you
It's room for just two
This is not a love song, this is all about you
I know what your boyfriend thinking
He love you too
Just stay that sweet and take life steps one-and-two
This about you girl, wassup

[Interlude]
Ba-da-bum-bum, she look so good today
And the sun is so bright, it don't matter what you do
Or what you feel
Just live our life today
Even with Black and Blue Flames

[Hook]
Ms. Woman, Ms. Woman
I wanna tell you why you so special
A lot of women on earth
You are unique

[Outro]
One time for the one time
One time for the West Coast
One time for the East Side
One time for the South Side
One time for the North Side
One time for the Mid-West
One time for the South Side
One time for the worldwide
