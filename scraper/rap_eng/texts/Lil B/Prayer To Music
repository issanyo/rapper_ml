[Intro:Lil B] Real hip-hop, this Lil B
For all u nonbelievers, yall make me laugh

[Verse 1:Lil B]
You want that real shit niggas done lived it
Bruh you don't know me you be judging and shit
Niggas like me i might lay ya head down, the 9 is to rep now
You dont need respect now, check this my brain thinkin' streets and hustles
I ain't ever did school so i bleed in the struggle
Fuckin' wit some fake niggas cuz we all was robbers
Nigga some turned cool, other ones ain't stop it
I choose to be that young one brother that did it
All my niggas slept on me i was countin' them digits
I be on that goon shit, i dont be fuckin' them bitches
No shower for days hopping in random caddillacs
Riding round East Oakland with the lumberjack
OGs had my back real talk i was moving fast
Aw i know i gotta go i dont feel correct
Fuck around and rest open chea by the ? station
Thinking bout my last dollar i was feelin' ill
I did some real foul shit I apologize foreal
With my town bruh boy that was bustin' deals
Feelin' like its ten years shit and i be bustin' still
I be having thoughts...on a.. mill
Teachers vibe to this, i be speakin' like calculus
Two plus two equals Desert eagles
Straight dope in the trunk feel like im 96 cassette tapes over this
No hope in the projects, got to speak the right words
You gotta read books to see curves
In my life i had to pass the slurrs
I be talking to the mic like a pastor
I ask him questions my futures ahead of me
Pops wasn't there for me
Some nights it was real ugly
Feel like im alone on concrete, feelin' on concrete
Couldn't hear, couldn't look her in the face when my moms meet
Had so much pain in my heart i could not sleep
To be a real thug man that was not me
Im more like a solo artist
Riding four deep, BasedGod Prodigy like Mobb Deep
My deep bullets up in ya brain you will not speak
Boy doing dirt be on the run for like 9 weeks
Moving out the house smoking dope thinking that he clean
But its shit that he smoked
Just trying to paint a picture of the situation
Put yourself up in the radio station
Broadcast live, all cast lies
Could tell you a snake by the focus in your eyes
Ya face dont lie, surviving off the real shit
Going through hell but still want to kill shit
Niggas done pushed me to the edge to where im feelin' lonely
People turning on me everyday so fuck homies
All family in my cirlce, but they fake as well
So i lay down and i start to call
A prayer for music this is Red Flame Devil Music

[Outro:Lil B] Im just trying to find the center of my thoughts, bear with me
My music is like this, two plus two equals what?
You already know the answer right, Two plus two equals four
Im the type of rapper that just says two plus two and lets you figure out the answer
Lil B, Red Flame Devil Music
