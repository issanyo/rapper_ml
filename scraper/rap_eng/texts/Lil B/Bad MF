[Verse 1]
Watch out, I'm a bad motherfucker
And if you don't I might have to bust ya
I come from Berkeley
Where motherfuckers put you on a shirt G
And don't think nothing 'bout it
Everybody in the club gettin' rowdy
It's nobody like me
Everybody in the world gettin' hyphy
I roll with the hustlers
We only want the money motherfucker
I sleep with the lights on
We don't like broke bitches where I'm from
Ring-to-the-ding-dong
It's me motherfucker with the iPhone
I know you bitches love me
End of discussion

[Verse 2]
You can't see me, even with glasses
West Coast motherfucker and I'm smashin'
I don't care if you play this on the radio
Cause they love me from Oakland to Filmore
Yeah I'm from the ghetto
Where motherfuckers will change your whole schedule
You can meet me at the side show
I'm a rap star, bitch, I don't ride slow
We goin' on a mission
You a scary motherfucker and you trippin'
I never been a busta
You snitch and a fake motherfucker
So why should I respect you?
You would tell everything if they let you
You can't hang with us
Catch the bus motherfucker

[Verse 3]
This ain't school, so why you wanna test me?
Waterfront, motherfucker, it gets messy
And shouts out to Richmond
Ridin' in the Lexus and they pimpin'
Shout out North Oakland
At Bushrod, bitch, and we smokin'
And shout out my cousin
Cause everybody know that I love him
I must be a rap star
Everywhere I go I'm ridin' in the fast car
I don't do interviews
Cause every time I talk, nigga, I make the news
And that's non-fiction
You can tell how the fuck that I'm livin'
And this is how I'm reppin'
2017, bitch
