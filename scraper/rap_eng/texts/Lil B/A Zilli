Very tropical
X-Game Heem

Boys is playing games
I'm a trouble, I'm taking all of that
Berkeley Boys up on the map
I swear she bad, she licked my sack
Brrangdangdangdang, all I asked
And then she blew me out my strap
Niggas say that I can't rap because I'm from the west coast
I'm just complex, like the magazine
I'm so fresh, so clean
Pink Dolphin is all I wear
Look at my eyes, your diamonds stare
Your girl wanna cut, bitch I don't care
I'm a bad boy like Dilinjah
Hills lex, shoulders bent
Ask them, order them
Check that, buy that
Scratch that, buy that
Momma in the cut, what you doing
Looking for the chewing
Me and my boys riding high
That's what I'm doing
Looking for a lesbian
That like to kiss pussy
I was hitting it from the back
While her friend licked that coochie
Man, I'm looking for a pro
Give a shit about a rookie
Like a win-a-slam-dunk 'test
Dunking on her booty
Man, I love to sit back-seat
I need a limo driver
Man, I smoked so many blunts
I ain't trying to get no higher
Man they say that I'm on fire
There's no need to pass a lighter
If you want to let it burn
I'll proceed to get you higher
I'm a king, she called she called me sire
Yes my brain, is automatic
Man, I been deserved a Grammy
She don't give it I'm a grab it
Please step up I let them have it
Please wrap up I let them have it

[Break]
Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok... I'm reloaded

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Be so be so classy
I took her face, the chick was nasty
Man, you ask me what I'm doing
Boy, I took her babby
Hey baby, where she had me
At my shows, I let her grab me
Where its cindy
Where its brandy, man
We gotta head up the parties
Oh my god,I'm looking sporty
Oh my god, Kiesha's naughty
Gave me head at Kiesha's party
Lord for give me for what I've started
I'm a legend in the jungle
Only suckas eat the lions
And the lions get the money
Why you stop me
Why you trying
Why they hate me
Why you trying
Suck now-or-later's
Seen a fine girl she gone suck now or later
I'm a big boy, like shaq
Uh, like shazzam

Hit it from the back, from the si-zide
All his-eems, siz-eems, yeah
Boss, naw mean
Ask him, ask her, boss, naw mean
Man, boy, want a verse that's 35 g's
Think about it for a second

Like this, I got a dream
And I'm the king, naw mean
Shit, paper paper's all I'm after
All that money, mucho dinero
Yes man, mucho, how I'm doing
Macho manos
Hit that thing like pornostar
Triple X, I'm the best
Fuck yes, I'm the best

[Break]
Blaze the blunts, Yeah, Yeah man, Pass me that weed man
Light up that blunt, Yeah
Blaze the blunts, Blaze the blunts, Blaze the blunts
Yeah, Aye

[Verse 3: Lil B]
Check, I'm not on your level
I'm a cyborg
A lot of rappers in this game
Want to live and die for it
I told them I ain't playing
I told them I ain't rapping
This some real life shit I ain't just rapping
I'm an underground king like UGK
But they ain't feeling me
I told them I'll be history
You like me or you hate me
But I choose to be on top
Cause I can't be on the bottom
Man, my name is Lil B
Brrangdang and I got them
Man, I love to set trends
Young Bitch about my dollars
Six inch heels in the scraper
Titty-bopping
Told them I'm a problem
Man they need to get them ready
Want to hit but you can't touch
Just like the tip of a machete
Because I'm ready
Tats on deck, Ass on deck
And Stacks on deck
And glass on deck
And Hoes up next
The West up next
And Berkeley up next
Tikkity Tikkity Tock
Now I done looked up on the wall
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all
Who's the baddest of the land
I am, I am
Lil B is
And you know that shit

[Outro]
Man it ya boy Lil B, for Lil Boss, man
My boy said I wasn't going to do this
And he said he going to pay me to do it, man, so I did it
Pack boys, Bay Area
They say "since you from the west coast you can't rap"
Man, basedboys all day
Lil B, myspace.com/packalbums
Easily, it's a wrap
