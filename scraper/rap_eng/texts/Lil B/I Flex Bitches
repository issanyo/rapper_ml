I got the bitches, I got the candy
I got them hoes, he knows who’s on me
Fuck that, nigga, I arrive in the 'forty
Bitch know she want me, imma show you who got it
Fuck around with me, bitch, imma show you the little profit
Swag on round here, came in the chopper
Fifty thousand dollars on a next bitch watch ah
Watch me came in, swagger
Would she know I came in to do the photo, do without
Bitch, you know I come with the fifty five magnum
Im Strapped up, from better, badder than me
Better than main bitch, coming with the jet-ski
Fifty thousand dollars imma show them how to mix me
Next holla bitch know imma come to fifty though
Riding downtown and I look like Sisco
Fifty six bitches fuck me ‘cause I look like Sisco
Riding round the town and the bitches looking disco
Imma bake the town with the fifty five crystal
Imma show these bitches now we’re running with the fifty though
Imma show these hoes playing with the game

Bitch, don’t play with the game, you feel me?
Imma get swagger, fifty one magnum
Thirty six bitches fuck me because I’m landwis
Fuck me, hoe, know that I come spending canvas
Fifty six bitches fuck my niggas, says you know them
Imma come in with the fifty five cold air
Bitches know me on land, you and your old man
Fifty six bitches and I look like Coby
Thirty six bitches and I run like George Foreman
Hit the bitch with the long one, imma fly that kite low
Imma come with the cader, cader
Happy Halloween, bitch
