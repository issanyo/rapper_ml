[Intro: Lil B]
You know, I'm just bloggin' my life away
You know, shout out to all the bloggers, you know what I'm saying?
Internet baby, you know we keeping this shit live, man, you know what I'm saying?
Computer day, all day, man, what it do?

[Verse: Lil B]
I'ma be a blogger, I'ma write about my life
Travellin' in time, the time jogger
How you can't critisize me, we are awesome
They scared of the boss
Don't leave, lay 'em on the fucking lawn
I'm so ugly, but I'm so gorgeous
Put me in the parks, to dress a pussy
Put the cologne in the cabinet
Bring me a coke bag, I'll put you in the attic
Bring me a bad bitch, you know I gotta have it
I just want her booty, I just want her mouth
Black kisser, blockbuster night
You a blockbuster, right?
I'ma (?) twice, you feel me?
I'ma show you nothing's nice, show you 'bout the heist
I'm not living right, this "The Sims: Hot Date"
I'ma take you on the flight, and I'ma kiss you goodnight
We gon' party for real, nigga
Smoke a blunt
Man, the girls love Lil B
Man, I swear I was just talkin' bout that last week
Niggas hatin' on me
Man, I swear I was just talkin' bout that last week
Niggas be lyin'
Florida BasedGod what it do? I'm back
One hundred grand show, man, dude, that's crack
Comin' from the bottom, I've been used to that
Wakin' up on the island with the breakfast basket
Clear white sand, fresh fruit
Stop thinking about problems that are stressful
Most people want to be left alone
A lot of people scared to be left alone
So I gotta finish number one, yeah
Niggas scared of the dark
I'ma write those checks, you feel me?
Always do that, and my word's kept
I'ma be real till my last one's left
And niggas wanna hate, fuck that
My last resort, I'm fine
But I'ma talk to 'em and blog about it
Thank you BasedGod I'm all about it
I'ma talk to 'em and blog about it
Thank you BasedGod I'm all about it

[Outro: Lil B]
I'ma blog it
I'ma blog it
I'ma keep on blogging it, nigga
I'ma blog it
I'm a blogger
I'ma keep on bloggin', nigga
I'ma blogger
Yeah, I'm a blogger
Writin' about my life
I'm a blogger
Nigga, I'ma keep on bloggin'
