(Verse 1: Lil B)
Tiny pink shirt, nigga tell yo bitch
Biotchmob, bitchmob, nigga
Tell me bout the bitchmob
Hoes on my dick cause I look like the Basedgod
Niggas get they head bust, we living in bondage
Looking in the mirror, not reflecting on the objects
How I'm gon' live when them people so exhausted
And they don't respect these artists
Real artists be the legends
And I'm going the hardest
Rap niggas dead fucking targets
Cornerstore gangstas, asphalt gangstas
I hit you niggas fast with the reflex, I'm not fighting
Niggas playing like rejects
Call me sugar shane, I'm holding that shan bailey
Hit you suckas with the gun, man, like the navy
Forest is cockren I raised you
My gun like the motherfucking parent cause I raised you
Nigga I will save you
I'm the pretty bitch and I'm handsome
Smoking up dope I be thinking that I'm handsome
Fucking no one man taking those chances
Nigga play with honor, I ain't taking those chances
Can't trust your kids cause they fake too
Niggas skating ice, man, they trying to break through
Nigga I'm tryna break you
I won't hesitate, niggas gotta shape you
It was ?
Niggas getting shit straight
Mom's tryna get straight, dads gotta get straight
Glock put you in yo face, smack you down don't even play
Nigga I got allegations, it won't even say
Nigga coming whip with me
Imma knock you out the cake
Niggas coming with the ?
Imma give yo ass a K
