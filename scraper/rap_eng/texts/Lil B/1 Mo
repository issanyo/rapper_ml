(Verse 1: Lil B)
Snitches die fast, Suckas die faster
I would've been a number if I didn't become a rapper
Bagging up crack, I'm addicted to the plastic
Addicted to the smell, I'm addicted to the ashes
Smoking on the weed it got the effects that the crack get
Set niggas up, one dot I got pain
How I live with the pains of the game
Turned myself in, cause I'm g'd up solid
Never flyed first class
I'd rather fly first with crack
Imma smoke a plate, send a plate, then relax
Niggas got opinions, but don't state facts
When you got facts I come correct with you
Hit you straight with the pistol
I'll make the shit harder to get to
I'm making niggas shit fucking hard
When the win do
On the pistol line, have my niggas come get you
The way I cook crack, I feel so magical

(Hook: Lil B)
Baby, give me one more chance, Give me one more chace

(Verse 2: Lil B)
I ain't finna die a gangsta
Hoodie in the summertime
Niggas want x-pills I want that hard rock
I want that guitar, I want that space
Put me in the booth I whip crack everyday
Keep it 100 I whip crack like the slaves
Build a couple schools off the money that I made
Niggas hate taxes, but I pay taxes
Nigga getting pimped, by the credit and the plastic
Niggas kill niggas for the money, cause they average
That's so petty, that's so weak
Yeah, I'm finna sell the sack
And go off to jail with them suckas and them rats
Stick with the system, they ain't want to pay for that
They want you in jail, they want you all that
You feel me?
This is 05 fuck em, realize the pain you in
Hop out it

Baby Give me one more chance
