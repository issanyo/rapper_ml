"You know, for this Hoop Life, Lil B, I'ma tell you something youngin'
If you don't put your life into it, you ain't gon' make it"
I come from the other side, where people don't talk about
Hoop Life mixtape, bitch I'm trying to make it out
Gotta see another route, cause people just stress me
Try to build me up, but they never will protect me
So I gotta see stuff and handle it directly
Cause if I don't ante up, nobody respect that
You better get back, never let a man talk shit
With no get back, you feel me?
Shooting at the gym, man, them niggas won't forget that
Yak dance at the gym, guns at the gym
My coach don't say shit, I'm not on probation
I keep my nose clean, cause it's so racist
F*ck them niggas, above the rim, niggas
See my heart is gold, and it's...
NBA here I come, it's my time to shine
I was really blowing up, with them people overseas
Look me in the face, they know it's more than what it seems
I feel nowadays, nobody even dreaming
Far from believing, remember Based Jam
I was working offseason, seeing D-League and
F*ck D-League if they don't understand me
Just understand money, sign the check, that's enough
I'm here lifelong, hall of fame
This my song, nobody can sit on my throne
I told my partner on the phone, I'm gone, got long
But I'd rather live life over anything involved
Trying to live my life with less scars, less jewelry
Less cars, less whips, less chains
Rather play the game, I run the game
Gotta see a better side before you front on me
Worldwide, Basedworld, Lil B, Thank you BasedGod
This some real shit, on some ill shit
Today like nobody had my interests
And let me mention, I was always in class
Always on detention
Just trying to get my name mentioned
In the hall of fame, Lil B in the same sentence
Worldwide superstar, I got the game pimped
And before rap, I loved wrap, so, nigga, I ain't tripping
Never hit licks with me
So long high speeds, trying to find my place
In the world, a name in this world
Some people don't make it out, this a real dangerous world
No world can tell me that you don't love me
No homo, man, they rooting for me
Lil B, man, you the truth, homie
Not many niggas real, most of these niggas clones
Phony ass niggas said I'm the truth
Then they got injured, man, they said I lost juice
People hating you, that's a easy thing to do
Got the screens, man, I gotta make moves
Moving on the court, open space for the team
You're clogging up the lane, full of greed
Might as well just have the motherf*cking team
You don't give a f*ck, man, you don't even play the game
But you wanna get paid
That's the reason why all these suckers play
But you gotta have money, to own some thangs
Got dope in the locker room, I could show you some thangs
These bitches don't want none, these hoes ain't nothing
Cocaine monotone, I ain't telling nothing
Who want the work, man, I got houses and bitches
3-story penthouse, superstarred all my bitches
Got workers, got people, that can handle business
Rip up mic's, man the city is ours
I play top notch, you can't match my bars
This is Lil B, all day, I'm getting so large
Team getting so hard, and the city is ours
I swear to god, man, it's ugly outside
Man, I gotta...man, my willingness lie
I love to fly high, man, my vision to ride
I ride with the team, nigga, our mission is dollars
People wanna scream and holler, I can't hear 'em
I told these niggas "f*ck 'em", their faces is so hollow
Wanna see them putting faces on bottles
A lot of niggas wanna scream, because they pussy like models
Shine underwater, my face is the goggles
Don't quit your dreams, nigga, they can't stop you
Plus it's Hoop Life real, man, I'm going full throttle
Seen 'em, got 'em, spot 'em, separate my rivals
Most people ready, classify 'em as nothing
You feel me? The birth of Lil B
Is a prophet, I'm coming down, nigga, y'all hollering
Only nigga on TV, making rounds in the hood shopping
I ain't never been gay, you feel me?
You niggas out shopping, you niggas in the hood:
I'm out here hooping, like it's no option
I need this, baby
My life for it
I love you, nigga
"Well, get ready for the game then, Lil B
You seem like you focused and you more ready for the NBA than ever
And you about to get your chance in the league
So when you do, just make sure you prepared"
Lil B legendary, I love you
