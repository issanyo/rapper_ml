[Hook]
Today is robberversiary
It's our robberversiary
Do you know what today is?
It's our robberversiary
Our robberversiary

[Verse]
You know I couldn't leave you
Married to the mind frame
Came back a couple times
Grind again
Break 'em off slower
Pistol in the pea coat
Scraping, aw fuck that!
I stole a truck
Riding high and I'm blowing blunts
Niggas mad cause I'm counting money
And I'm off probation
Niggas mad cause I'm iced out; rollerskatin'
That's after rap
Before that I was broke and hatin'
Hitting houses and snorting mountains
Off lean mixed with Hennessey
My whole liver fucked off
Still I don't give a fuck and rushed off
Never went to class, always at the buss stop
Lil B nigga, always keep moving
Always keep the extra clip, nigga in the Ruger
Huh, can't take my past to the future
So I went today, July 10th, and robbed a Shooter's

[Bridge]
Hear that baby? You know what today is
I remember the first day I robbed and we got married
Got married to the game and I never left

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
July 10th, 15. Got married to the game the first time
Hit my first lick. Married to the game ever since
But you know, I have to get divorced. You know what I mean?
But I'm just... gonna tell the game that, you know I've been married and um, this our robberversiary
