[Verse 1: Lil B]
This is Red Flame
Devil Music Edition
And nah I don't worship the devil
Pretty much
This a metaphor
For music
And what the people, artists
And I see them feeding the communities
But listen to this

I got the game on smash
I brought it to the front
This is foes
This is the hood
Niggas'll never front
Word to God I never prayed to money
Asked angels above
I seen niggas shady and hungry
I kept moving
Knowing once I was a hitter
Mind controlled by TVs and niggas
The terminator is a hood-saviour
Flavor
But no flavor in love
Girls are shady like clubs
Let you in the V.I.P. with no love
Fuck a bitch
Bitch I'm getting paper
What the fuck is a label?
And why these people in labor
Working harder than slavers
Try to watching the news with no cable
A lot of dark nights involving hustling
People struggle
Put faith in the deadly dozen
Money
Destruction
Hate
Extermination
Please don't speak the fatal disease
People sleeping in peace
We at war in a place overseas
And we still lie praying to Jesus
People shoot and they bleeding
Murderers be getting hunted by demons
Ride on you with the pump and they heathens
Ride on you and squeeze it, went to sleep
He woke up and met Jesus
Pray to God I wake up when I'm sleeping
One eye for the suckers
One eye for the world believing
Third eye in the middle for weedin'
When you live in the suite
In the hood they bust on you like semen
Can't compare if no love in your heart
You gotta forgive
You gotta learn that the people are smart
You gotta have the love in your heart
I'm speaking for real
I coulda rapped about how real that I am
To tell the truth it's for the people indeed
I'm planting my seeds
Next time I'll be a legend indeed
Until then
Appreciate me
I'm speaking for peace
Don't let me die
And see the legend in me

Outro:
Don't let me die then see the legend in me
