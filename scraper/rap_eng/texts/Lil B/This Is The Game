[Intro]
A lot of people told me about the game
They said if the game wasn't fake, then why would you play it
Welcome to life, Lil B
This is the game

[Verse 1]
Mom just had a stroke I don't know what to do
She said she's okay but is she telling the truth
I'ma keep on rolling as life's unfolding
Moving fast and not knowing
This life is crazy
I sped up my whole life because this get-back's crazy
Never showed my pain and I never been lazy
I came from a place where some people go crazy
And they work you to death plus they minimum wage you
You working for the man and your ideas is stolen
They excuse you work for 'em but deep them knowing
If the work force made a strike then everything frozen
Everything stops if you no cab drivers driving
You better pay respect to people that's walking by you
Always love all they shit that's behind you
Most loopholes and contract laws is to bind you
You a thug on paper and you a thug in real life too
The credit scores man, I'm just tryna live my life dude
Say if I miss a credit payment then I won't be able to live where the *censored* I want to
These rich foes saying things that they won't do
They just send you a bill that's gonna haunt you
Bet against you, the bets made for it
It's cheaper to lock you up with these riddles
This is the game

[Hook x2]
Why oh why I sing
This is the game for me

[Verse 2]
I'ma give you real game, the police is working for you
But they try to lock up, there's no sense in working for you
Tryna pay your parking tickets
My whole life, fuck your parking tickets
Trying to write a new line and start a sentence
Who just started a sentence
Don't say a word if you don't burn
You gotta work for it
This is more than forgiving, came back and made millions out of project buildings
Shout out to Lil B
I'm feeling dry in Tennessee
They put architects in New Orleans
I'm real like Georgia, home cooking soul food
Really hits you when you eat it
Get your mind right cause *censored* is deceiving
Most people they fake and they want to deceive you
A lot of people jealous and they tryna get even
I'ma keep it real, this is the game
It's Lil B

[Hook]
