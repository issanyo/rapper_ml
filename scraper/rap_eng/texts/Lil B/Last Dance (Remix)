Imma risk taker and this my last dance
I know its consequences, but I gotta take that chance

My life is a gamble and Imma roll the dice

This the last dance
This the last dance, This the last dance
I'm going all out
This the last dance

(Verse 1: Cashout Clete)
Cashout Clete, Imma living legend
I swear it's a blessing
Just to be in up my presence
Lets talk work, I show you recompressing
Lets hit the club, I show you how I'm flexing
It's the grand gang, we move a little different
You either sell dope, kick doors or did some killings
This no fairy tale, this really how I'm living
I beat my last case, that's why I ain't go to prison
Sold my last pound, sold my last brick
This my last shootout, send my last hit
This my last robbery, this my last lick
I'm the last Don, this as real as it gets

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Lil B)
I'm down to face 10, I'm down to face 30
I respect Lil B, cause he got his hands dirty
It's Young Basedgod, man that pretty bitch serving
I never would snitch, and I never would serve ya
Playing both sides cause I know who do the murder
You can't read my mind, the technology ain't perfect
Fuck cell phones, size you up, but won't serve ya
Niggas can't handle when the judge say its over
Imma keep it real, mane, motherfuck the rollers
Pop a pill in court, like my niggas in florida
Judge try to send me, kill his family and its over
I won't go to trial, know I did it and its over

(Hook)
