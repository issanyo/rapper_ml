Yeah, ayy first off you feel me. It's your boy Lil B in the house. I wanna give a shout out to the Midwest. Hey Detroit what's good if you got your buffs on, what it do? You know what I'm sayin'. Ayy man Chicago, the whole motherfuckin' world. What's good?

[Chorus]
Ayy ayy ayy, what's your net worth?
Hu, hu? what's your net worth

[Verse 1]
Bitch nigga ask me bout my net worth
You already know I make that check work
You already know I make that bank twerk
Running up that check now my back hurt
Niggas playing games want that fucking check
100 grand show nigga and I ain't playing
This that Stevie Wonder nigga, a little richer
BasedGod on the beat now we getting richer

[Chorus]
Ayy ayy ayy, what's your net worth?
Hu, hu? what's your net worth?

[Verse 2]

All my West Coast niggas fuck that bag up
All my down south niggas run that check up
All my East Coast niggas man we next up
All my Minnesota niggas run that check up
All my Kansas City niggas run that bag up
All my Ohio niggas run that check up
All my Las Vegas niggas run that bag up

And I'm still getting money with my Tahoe bitches

And my Albany niggas run that check up

[Chorus]
Ayy ayy ayy, what's your net worth?
