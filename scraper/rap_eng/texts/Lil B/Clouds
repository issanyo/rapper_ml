I got the eyes of a lion, a heart of a cat
I gotta watch my every step, I don't trust you niggas
You say you do this, but who you nigga?
Last time I see you, you was screw you niggas
Now you all on my dick cause I got rap money
Don't think I won't put it up, next to your money
You really got a problem, talking death, you don't tote heat
Making niggas bleed Like Biggie Smalls
Damn niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Man, ran upon a bitch and pulled a caper
He thought Lil' B was a sucka
Until he seen the killers that's behind him, man, it's nothing
Call them bodysnatchers if you scared to call the pastor
Bitch I'm fucking driving and I'ma put guns at you
Since you ain't scared of a man I finna show you this
How you put my life in your hands
I never play dirty cause them niggas die
Maz used to hate on me, now I look him in the eyes
Send him a trip in the sky
All you do is lie like a 745, you got the whole body
I cop the Maserati, riding through the hood
I'm seeing everybody
Niggas don't love me, that's life when you famous
I ain't even hurt
Pretend I never heard a nigga saying Lil' B faking
Never heard them saying that I was a sucka
Never been a snitch, never been an undercover
Fuck being this, that dope-fiend mental
Niggas never rock, fuck them niggas, it's simple
Easy money get you fucked over with taxes
Uncle Sam ready to put you down, he laughing
Cause you stupid niggas pay to be in jail
I'd rather be on earth than ridin' out no bail
I'd rather work hard to be sitting in a cell
Talking about you found God, you burning up in hell
We make mistakes, I remain positive, things catch up
Watch how you live, don't move fast, please slow down
It's enough love and money to go around, I guarantee
