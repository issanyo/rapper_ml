Yea welcome to this P.Y.T., I want to take ya'll to my life, you feel me?
You know, this shit real rare that I even made it out, yea

[Verse 1, Lil B]

I may hit a nigga with the chop in the daylight
Took off low then take a vacation
Get the dope man with the same situation
He made this noise when I showed him that K
Fuck around with me I be letting off fifty rounds
R.I.P. Big Moe, shout out to H-Town
Niggas around me keep it pushing
A lot of pussy niggas but I never ate the pussy
All my life I had to keep it pushing
Shout out to Aris, that's my other brother
Shout out to Kim, shout out to Anthony
Shout out to Nicole, shout out my nigga Trim
Shout out my nigga Ivan, shout out my nigga Tut
Shout out my nigga James, shout out my nigga Paris
Shout out to Amir, shout out my nigga Will
Shout out the Brothahood, shout out NHT
Shout out Deezy Dollar, shout out to Philos
Real niggas in Sacramento, out there with dope rocks
Shout out to Burnelli, shout out to Cricket
Shout out my cousin Rocket, shout out my cousin Brittany
Shout out my two brothers, shout out my two sisters
Still got two parents, every day I still miss them
Shout out to Shamele, shout out my nigga Shelton
R.I.P. my nigga Larry, R.I.P. my Richmond niggas
I can't deal with it, why they gotta kill niggas
This is all program, this was all a science
Complex hate crimes, niggas out pushing lines
Niggas outside like, fuck it, I'm broke, fuck it
I'mma take a nigga life, anybody die tonight
If I play my cards right niggas gon' ball for life
Feel me, yea, positive endings
Never been switching
Tombstone gon' read that "I stay realer"
Fake bitch killer
Put em up in the wall, seal em' off to the floor
Cocaine rap but the dope costs more
Got the same prices as the numbers on the floor
Had to sell zips, had to bag fours
Didn't lose my cool when I was shopping at the mall
Police saying "Lil B you finna lose it all"
Niggas like me, I was planning for the loss
Took a couple licks for the summer riding Porsche
It's all about my life nigga, what about yours
It's all about my life nigga, what about yours
It's all about the world nigga, what about ours
Lil B
