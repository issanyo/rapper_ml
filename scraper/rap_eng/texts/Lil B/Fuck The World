(Intro)
Yeah, I'mma tell you man I seen a lot of shit man
You feel me?
That shit will turn you real, sour or whatever
I'm talking about, this will make you love the world
But it will make you see shit real

Niggas seen what I seen, bitch, I'm traumatized
I look death in his eyes
I'mma tell you what I seen, niggas did jail time for grief
Pump bricks in the streets to supply the fiends
Don't nobody know what my conscious means
I'm stressed out, nigga, I'm stressed the fuck out
Almost 25, staying at mom's house
I caught a case, and then he caught a case
And thought it's a game how I'm changing face
I'm born black, I can't change my race

I'm positive
Real talk I'mma see what my options is
I seen hood niggas that's flexin Maybach
I rob any coupe with an Oakland A's hat
Let niggas know that I rep the Bay
Lil B, shout out to LA
New jacker, man that shit's forreal
Playing talks man, we never take that back
All the drugs that I did I (muted) never
Still in the street like the Panthers back
Like Marcus bookstore, gingerbread house
Lil B man, I put the lead in your mouth
Shout out to Rob Low and the hustler
You feel me, I ain't know I would survive the stuggle
Keep my head up through the stormy weather
Man the world on my back, all this pressure
How I'm worldwide and I ain't sold no records
Man my name's Lil B I'm the C
100k for a verse, I don't rap for free
But I give rap, bitch pay tax for me
This the world man, they backing me
I'm Japanese man
Imagine what's in the back of me
10 shots, bitch like a daquiri
Nigga, ain't no limit like Master P
Fuck what I seen
I seen a lot of bullshit
Things would turn ya, make you turn blue
But it really ain't that
You feel me?
I'm finna bring the Bay back
Niggas stay living classy, way above average - Lil Boss

(Outro:)
Bitch mob!
That made a nigga hold the strap
That made a nigga watch his back
I started yelling "Fuck the world!" (fuck it!) x2
