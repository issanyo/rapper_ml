[Intro]
Ain't no more G code, nigga
I broke that shit
Let's get it

[Verse]
Only a few real niggas gonna last in this game man
Easier to die than to get a real job
Now I'm thinking what the fuck is the motherfuckin' problem
Niggas steal, niggas kill, niggas shoot, niggas rob
Everyday I ask God when this shit gonna stop
When the people wake up, when the thugs leave the bop
When they see the whole world and live without a lie
Shit ain't hard man, pimpin' and you watch
Most of y'all niggas bust with a family with the money
Man I used to be a slave, ain't a damn thing funny
Only thought of Martin Luther King
Gotta be more than the motherfuckin' dream
As I sit back man and my heart start to beat
And I inhale this weed and I just start to think
Why everybody judging motherfuckin' cover
Won't look at you but he tell you that he loves you
Shit's real easy when you're hiding all your feelings
Man I want the whole world man, motherfuck a million
Motherfuck the pussy man, shootin' with the guns
Fight with your hands and put down the guns
You fuckin' bitch

[Outro]
It's that quick knowledge
Nigga got the speech impediment all that
I don't give a fuck what you feel
Understand it nigga
Based World nigga, Based World all day
