[Intro]
Fuck it nigga. We back with it, you know what I'm saying? Thugged Out Pissed Off, all I can do is  feel this pain. This for all my niggas that's been riding with me, all the women that's been riding with me. You know what I'm saying. Everybody can be a nigga, you know what I mean. Anybody, you feel me. Thugged Out Pissed Off

[Verse 1]
The meaning of the window is the light
You could focus on the picture, you gotta see it right
Take advice bitch I used to not listen
Til I had a situation kicked up and rolled with the other
My [?]
[?] I eat the finest of fruits
Ate grapes like a kid bitch, take hoes on ski trips
Listen to a lot of Egypt but they never called it
[?] can't put a shirt on
Bitches ain't shit but still wanna be your number one
You could be my ten, pass around like smoking blunts
I fuck you then I'm done, can't picture having fun
Knockin' heads kicking cans and fake love
I know what day it is, don't remind me
I wouldn't think about it, my life is grimy
Time after time peace -- bitch just die, please

[Break]
Know what I'm saying
I ain't never gave a fuck about 'em
Lil B

[Verse 2]
[?] I smoke a blunt and I make believe
My ears are like numbers, my lungs are like smoke leave
Rain comes pouring down every time I go bad
Metaphor for my pain that I see through this black mask
My mind skips away when I open my mouth
I turn up the volume, see this pain I'm talkin' about
Waiting for buses getting passed up by cabs in New York
Thumbs up, lookin' like a nail in the dark
This shit be this hard

[Break 2]
Forreal
See this pain, man
Rawest rapper alive, you feel me
Lil B man

[Verse 3]
We all tryna make a living
Can't remember the last time I had Thanksgiving
I can't celebrate, I won't forget it
We could go for hours talk about Lil B classics
You ain't on my level, this is pain [?]
Sworn in the game, I never know what's real
Only thing I got was the red and blue pills
No money, I had to go myself, what's the will
Even if I wasn't real, you wouldn't feel
Pay attention, take the time and you listen
On this highway of life, I rolled up boats on missions
Take plains to spots I had no destination
So focused I could wear my glasses backwards
Still see life at a angle [?]
One tied up, my other hand look free
One foot in the door, one foot in chains
I got a warrant but I don't really follow the law
Catch me when you catch me, this is for all my dogs
Niggas under born into this life with wonders
With my place in this world I was made by a woman
Man is the other half, my body [?]
We all like [?]
Living life to the fullest, never know when you pull it
You said I was soft then you must be foolish
Lil B in this bitch, I'm just like the ruler
BasedGod
