[Verse 1]
I been thuggin' for the last ten years now
Now I'm on the straight path, now I'm getting money now
Had to step my game up, I was on my fucking dick
Loan shark was a nigga tryna loan out shit
Now your boy came up, now I got the duffle bag
More money, more problems, nigga, you ain't never lie
Tell you like this "I ain't gon' tell nobody this"
Self-made nigga and ya kid got the ice wrist
Now I cook down and I had to sell my swag up
Nigga had the mack up, had to get my tips up
I ain't gonna be the nigga sitting in the jail cell
I wasn't worth ten jobs, bitch to do ten year
Fuck around with me, I'mma show you 'bout the business
It's real strict shit, man, still got the attitude
Still think a nigga try to play me with the real game
I ain't got this shit, man, I'm just try'na do my thing
Ain't 'bout the muthafuckin game or the bullshit
Stand for the west side, stand ten toes down
Stand cuz I'm motherfucking, bitch, I got the A-K
You talk to me, I'mma hit 'em with the 50-cal
Boy, around here, man, straight what I die for
Want no part, I just wanna be alive, boy
Niggas ask me how I'm not in the streets
Man, I face 36, bitch, I look like Big Meech
Gold in my teeth, man, still up in the streets, man
The niggas love me and I hate that fuckin' beef
Had to squash a couple things make ends meet
Nigga, it's young BasedGod
Bitch, I'm still up in the streets

[Hook]
I'm still thuggin', bitch, I'm still thuggin'
Everybody know that I'm muthafuckin' thuggin'
I'm still thuggin', bitch, I'm still thuggin'
Everybody know that I'm muthafuckin' thuggin'
