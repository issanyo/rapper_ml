Intro:
Aye nigga aye... Aye
I heard that you... said you got more bitches than Lil B
Now Ima... correct you
When... the last nigga told me that he had more bitches than Lil B
I, made the mistake and I believed him
And... I went to his house
And uhh- to prove my point- he did not have anywhere...
CLOSE to as many bitches that Lil B has
Lets get that

[Verse I: Lil B]
What's up wit that work, bitch you look like a superstar
I'm stuck in Miami
That shit mean we fuckin'
Hit the king of diamonds body that nigga bitch go broke
I'm off them blue pills, red pills ah, for reala
Ima tell ya who the deala
Ima tell ya who the bitch
I tally up, everything bitch I don't forget shit
Let the choppers talk, Ima talk Ima tell you what the fuck
I need a bitch, cause I look like ah. Jerry Springer
Ima... Press the button I don't gotta lift a finger
Man this beef shit deep, I be out on the streets
I don't go to the clubs, niggas know I tot the K
Ima tot that new Mac
Ima tot that Mossberg
Ima tot the new 30, commin' with the auto-aim
Fuck any bitch that... Don't fuck with me
Ima make it snap
Ima do the rodeo
Fuck what ya think, I'm holdin' that 40
Niggas act irrelevant- they girl gon' fuck me
I'm commin down with 20 bitches, niggas don't know me
Niggas gon owe me, ya learning bout the BasedGod
Down for the otha, Ima hit em' with fuckin chop
Bitch roll my blunt, I'm strapped up to the mothafucka
Look I'm on MTV, next I'm on BET
Bitch I'm gon snap
Bitch I don't rap
Ya already know I need a bitch from the trap (Okaay)
