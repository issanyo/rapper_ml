[Intro]
It's Lil B

[Verse]
I could rip apart your team, murder your squad
Your boys never seen a killer masked, peddle your ride
Leave him with ducktaped eyes, cover his eyes
Spread lies like the media runnin' for suicide
Often I don't try, you rappers is Papa John
Got the floor mack controllin' your whole design
Been puttin' in work, been doin' it overtime
Who woulda ever thought I'd see the world because of rhymes?
Spittin' hard times coming out, from the head
Niggas turned on in the game, leavin' 'em dead
I play by the rules, niggas is playin' chess
With the same mindset, I'm livin' with no regrets
I found out your best friend will talk to the judge
Court full of family, public defenders
We thuggin', no lawyers, low bar hustlers
Yeah, and shit, we rob 'em for the oil
Ski mask, cuz, uh, rockin' all black
It's BasedWorld, nigga, we [spit sound] nothin' you fall back
Black hoody, black coat, baggy jeans
No gloves, I'm stupid, that's me, blood on the sh-
You could, you can catch me, AK bullets spray like jet skis, ha ha
Yeah, niggas bangin' Mini Mob and niggas bangin' 7th Street
Where we come from, we dumb dumb
We murder like girls 'cause you fuck some, you dumb some
I seen it, nig- saw some, I won some
With the 9 you run from, I run some
Give a fuck 'bout your cred, nigga, it's BasedWorld
9 times outta 10, you niggas is absurd
Think shit, um, dumb nerd
Never get me, I'm from the section where the...
Supplyin' for weapons
It's little kids be shootin' guns with no question
Most people got no answers
Livin' every man for themselves is poison
Like Nas said, all this ghetto shit is poison
From the block, niggas hear this hearing noises
They head, dyin' fast, they breath
It's killers walkin' 'round the school with 9s and the 30 clips
The same ones you picked on, they bust that shit, it's real life
You could hear in my voice, how could I be fake?
I'm facin' 30 first time, not braggin', I'm just sayin' what's mine
And you wanna talk the struggle? Nigga, I was a teen facin' 9
Understand the time, nigga, I understand your mind
I had no money, don't care because I'm fine
I'ma be here, I'm happy to be alive
Runnin' through the guilt, nigga, I coulda died
I was a jackboy, waitin', inside
All for the money, but money is really nothin'
Niggas on the block be addicted to all this hustlin'
You gotta see the world and respect people that's strugglin'
Niggas catchin' murders, sellin' dope and even thuggin'
Million dollar spot, nigga, families at war
'cause the drugs on the block and the money in the cars
Battle for the scars, nigga, stories to tell
My brother's in prison, workin' in jail
I guess the only place they want us is, in a cell
Niggas go to jail, a ticket to hell
People look at me and be thinkin' things about me
I guess that's the world, so I'm high and I'm shoutin'
Be proud of the money you make, niggas be doubtin'
Please don't fall, just keep climbin' that mountain
Hustler for life, motherfuckin' accountant, Lil B, nigga

[Outro]
Nigga, this real struggle, nigga, real pain, nigga
I'm live from the hood, you bitch
Let's get it, motherfucker
Lil B, nigga, BasedGod, nigga
Illusions of Grandeur mixtape, yeah
