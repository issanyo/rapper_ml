[Intro]
I'm the rawest rapper living
(BasedGod)

[Hook]
Yeah, bitch I'm the rawest rapper alive
I'm the rawest rapper alive
Yeah, bitch I'm the rawest rapper alive
I'm the rawest rapper alive

[Verse 1]
I'm the rawest alive, go and tell 'em that
I'm the type of nigga that'll really push your melon back
I was locked for a minute but I bounced back
I trust nobody, I only count on stacks
Family had my back when I was really down
I ain't gotta connect, I'm trying to see a pound
I ain't got no money, I'm trying to see [?]
My whole family's struggling, we on the streets now
I got pride in my story, you don't know my glory
There's some real niggas waiting at the gates for me
If you disrespect me, you not impressed
I know the BasedGod and he's not a bitch
I'll kill anybody, that's on my life
I stay positive but I'm ready to die tonight
No amount of money could make me snitch
And I rather live real before I die rich

[Hook]
Yeah, bitch I'm the rawest rapper alive
I'm the rawest rapper alive
Yeah, bitch I'm the rawest rapper alive
I'm the rawest rapper alive

[Verse 2]
I'm starting to see life like PlayStation
Money can't buy this bond we making
So don't be alarmed if I'm not around
Like Mary J. Blige bitch I'm going down
I know the BasedGod, bitch you not the same
I might hurt you for my fucking pain
Low self-esteem, I was born ashamed
I don't wanna go home, this is not a game
Fuck your Rolls Royce, you a fucking lame
You ain't never seen the struggle, you don't know pain
My head hurts but I won't stop
Move out the way until I'm on top
I rock everyday like this
Everything real bitch, you never could write this
I make your girl say that she like this
And then make it blow up like ISIS

[Hook]
Yeah, bitch I'm the rawest rapper alive
I'm the rawest rapper alive
Yeah, bitch I'm the rawest rapper alive
I'm the rawest rapper alive

[Verse 3]
I'm close to the top and I won't fall off
Get money no doubt, bitch I'm so for real
It's like Philly's most wanted with a couple clips
These niggas got maliced, I just be pushing T's bricks
Roscoe P got that dope for cheap
I got that Neptunes on the blocks for weeks
Niggas don't understand that I got hits
BasedGod on the beats, now we getting rich
Shout out to Berkeley man, we coming up
Shout out to Oakland, we coming up
Shout out to Richmond, we coming up
We worldwide now and I don't give a fuck
I'm really with this punk rock rap shit
Based music forever, I'm back again
I'm with this punk rock rap shit
Based world Lil B, bitch I'm back again

[Outro Hook]
Let's get it
One time I said
Bitch, I'm the rawest rapper alive
Let's get it
I'm the rawest rapper alive
Niggas be sleep, all that shit ain't no questions
2017, let's get it
Bitch, I'm the rawest rapper alive
Now or never, let's get it
I'm the rawest rapper alive
I'm the rawest rapper alive
I'm the rawest rapper alive
I'm the rawest rapper alive
I'm the rawest rapper alive
