Bitch try to ride she gon' pay a fee
In the strip club I'm gonna make it rain
Ring the club out, I'm taking all the cheese
Keep it one hundred bitch it's all me
A lot of fake niggas wanna hate on me

Nigga hating on me get his wig split
Nigga hating on me get his bitch kissed
Nigga hating on me get his life bitch

[Verse 3]
I told that bitch she look like [?]
[?] my feelings don't get hurt
As I'm getting older bitches keep me young
Call me R. Kelly, let's have some fun
Ate the bitch pussy with her pants on
She look like Katy Perry, I'm gon' hit raw
Bringing girls around, I won't be involved
Look me in the eyes, do you wanna fuck me raw?
I can pay her, she can pay me
Leave the bitch alone, she trying to stock me
Self-made bitch, I hit the lottery
She can turn up, just follow me
All she wanna do is be with superstars
She can suck my dick to be in my car
Now I'ma tell you some real shit
The bitch was [?] was still sucking my dick
I'm on another whole nother level
I never get tired, I'm on my own schedule
I never wanna wait
Left her roses on the floor, now we on a date

[Chorus]
She fucking for the paper
She fucking for the paper
She fucking for the paper
Can't nobody save her
She fucking for the paper
She fucking for the paper
She fucking for the paper
Can't nobody save her
