[Intro]
Keyboard Kid on the beat!
Uh, uh uh (yessssssss)
Uh, mm mm
Rich After Taxes, Lil B

[Verse 1]
As my show, comes to an end
I want to thank you, we all win
I choose something, I never have thought
I had a spotlight, respected in New York
Uh, word for word
Study my lyrics from the nouns of verbs
So real, I announce the slurds
I'm in the sky, I connect with birds
I am a winner, protect the turf
Life, life, pushing the work
Same damn time, I was pushing the work
At the same damn time, I was landing to Earth
Same damn time, I was dyzing the fence
Another birthday, another one dead
To my subway, should show you what's real
Another homie died, I don't know how to feel
Death feel closer to me, I'm thinking right
Break off the change, put the beef to the right
And I'm down for the cause
I thank the world over here
Let's rule the world
I don't want to be greedy
But I sometimes feel like the world need me, feel me?
And I ain't trying to sound cheesy

[Hook]
I'm winning (fuck 'em), I'm winning (yeah)
I'm winning (fuck 'em), I'm winning (BasedGod)
I'm winning (fuck 'em), I'm winning (let's get it)
I'm winning (kyea), I'm winning (yes)
I'm winning (fuck 'em), I'm winning (that's right)
I'm winning (BasedGod), I'm winning (fuck 'em)
I'm winning (kyea), I'm winning (fuck 'em)
I'm winning (kyea), I'm winning (yes)

[Verse 2]
Like the little star, I'm here before
You should've seen what I had stuffed in the car
I'm still paranoid, pain is deeper
Don't understand me, what's to see?
What you see suddenly couldn't pursue
Still looking in the mirror, puzzled by the pieces
Sit down, you sucked on life
'Cause summertime, I remember what the self felt like
Made some mon', saw what hell felt like
The crimes that I did don't get built right
First time in life, black hole
Bro court man, you can get the whole damn time
Felonies on the street, that's a whole lot of crime
People working on the five, that's a whole lot of crime
Don't judge, see, the world is the mind
Don't judge, see, the world is mine, Lil B

[Hook]
I'm winning (fuck 'em), I'm winning (yeah)
I'm winning (fuck 'em), I'm winning (BasedGod)
I'm winning (fuck 'em), I'm winning (let's get it)
I'm winning (kyea), I'm winning (yes)
I'm winning (fuck 'em), I'm winning (that's right)
I'm winning (BasedGod), I'm winning (fuck 'em)
I'm winning (kyea), I'm winning (fuck 'em)
I'm winning (kyea), I'm winning (yes)
