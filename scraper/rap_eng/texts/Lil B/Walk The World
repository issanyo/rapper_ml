[Verse 1]
Walk the world, if I live today
To see another day, I pray to God I demonstrate
Most def, it's the traveling man, define the architecture
Thrift store with the awesome sweaters
Marvel style with the wooden dressers, touch the lamp-post
It shines bright when the light florescent
Real time like an instant message
A few art galleries show the meaning of the common artist
Far from broke, not a starving artist
Hot like I'm in August
Walk around humble what I'm thinking
Seeing new surroundings, new windows with the sills built right beside 'em
At an auction with the rarest items
I might bid on a few things, underestimate
But I got cash in these blue jeans
I'm really thinking about my life in a couple years
I keep traveling to understand my life's dear
Yeah

[Hook]
Keep travelin' around the world
The plane just wants my soul
And every time I look up, I see the world
But ain't no place like my home
Keep travelin' around the world
The plane just wants my soul
And every time I look up, I see the world
But ain't no place like my home

[Verse 2]
Different weather forecasts, the change is drastic
Since I came from the Bay where the weather is magic
Look at a few buildings
I inspected inside em, I touched the wall to feel they pasts
A hundred years and destruction lasts
I wanna build my soul, I call love that resembles a home
I take a breath of the air cause life is great
To explore another place, that's the nomad's race
But a rich nomad that converts to based
Then he walks around the Earth that's like it's space
Might talk with the trees while I'm in the wind
Because it's in, I'm at peace with the yellow lord
I'm looking out the window, thinking where my life is going
The pictures on the wall tell me I'm always rolling
Roll with the peace beside him
I'm not talking 'bout the gun, but the peace inside him
Lil B!

[Hook]
Keep travelin' around the world
The plane just wants my soul
And every time I look up, I see the world
But ain't no place like my home
Keep travelin' around the world
The plane just wants my soul
And every time I look up, I see the world
But ain't no place like my home

[Outro]
To end it off, I could leave this place
So I wanna leave a note on this music space
Make sure you keep your soul and keep it real
Cause new situations will later be ill
So I try to keep it in my mind, and prematurely
My plane leaves early, I love the world
I said my plane leaves early, prematurely, I love the world
