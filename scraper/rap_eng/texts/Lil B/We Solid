Yeah
This the story to my life, PYT
You know, they try to hold a real nigga down
Pretty Young Thug
This your boy Lil B
We in this bitch
We ain't stoppin

[Verse 1]
Deep in my thoughts is buried
Keep paying attention
Please don't act scary
Understand what it means to be me
Life decisions all that movin with precision
Go the distance, niggas lie
The game be scripted
I don't do that
Give a fuck about that Sim shit
Move illegal, cop breaks with the eagle
Stay with the metal
You would think I'm Magneto
Forgive me in the past
Niggas is dirty
Big pressure on my back been the rawest on earth,
Niggas getting murk
How I'm gonna live with the hurt?
Streets got me thinking like work
Never lay it off, pump the brakes
Get your brains dog, what is it? A blizzard
Yes bitch you don't know I'm in the bay dog
Was getting money, it's little B

Woman...
Man we can keep it with the gangsta shit
Or you can keep it with the
You know
We low, but we real
Yeah get money, get money
Get money to the harm
It's little B, real nigga shit
Imma tell you bout me man
Why we
Why we living

A gangsta never die
Metaphor to the world
Suit and tie, still shooting niggas
Drop in a second
Just to be a student, I was teaching, niggas moving
What's the movement?
It's scarecrow, niggas moving
Never. See the crop circles when I do it
My music is better, niggas ask if I ever great
Bitch you gotta wait and tell
My soul right now living through the drum
Please take my words like blood, You gotta live life and have fun
You gotta save yourself, this shit was made for you
And the blood the labour, but I keep my niggas eating
The world stay eating
I never got greedy
I just stay busy, you heard me?
I just stay busy, Lil B
I'm sorry nigga, let's get it
PYT mixtape
Nigga you heard what I hit, nigga you need that money?
That check cut, everything
Still going through
