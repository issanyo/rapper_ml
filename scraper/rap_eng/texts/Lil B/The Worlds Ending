[Intro]
…of chance to you, to him is one of real skill
So glad to meet you, Angeles
Picking up the ticket shows there's money to be made
Go on and lose the gamble that's the history of the trade
Did you add up all the cards left to play to zero
And sign up with evil, Angeles
Don't start me trying now uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
‘Cause I’m all over it, Angeles
I could make you satisfied in everything you do
All your secret wishes could right now be coming true
And be forever with my broken arms around you
No one's gonna fool around with us
No one's gonna fool around with us
So glad to meet you, Angeles

[Hook]
I’m just doing what I’m doing, I’ve been moving lately
I’m just trying to live my life, but this shit is crazy
And everybody think I’m good and I’m fantastic
Even though I’m in the game, bitch I’m not a rapper

[Verse 1]
Seen it’s real life when they killed the childhood friend
The funeral looked like a middle school reunion
Rewind the tape, man I swear they couldn’t do this
Now I live paranoid Confucius
Think about the day that I’m gonna stop breathing
Anything could happen please don’t misread it
Tornado watch in Orange Country I can see it
The world coming to an end I really can’t believe it

[Hook]

[Bridge 1]
Can’t nobody hear my cry when I’m in the zone
Don’t nobody give a fuck, bitch I’m all alone
And the people, man they really don’t give a shit
They’ll leave you on your dick and they’ll fuck your bitch

[Verse 2]
Why in school they didn’t teach about the taxes?
In the real world man it’s all about taxes
All about TV and living above average
Where the fuck you staying, all about your status
What the fuck you drive to the size of your mattress
How big your chain and the girls that you smashing
How much you work plus the time you relaxing
Time spent in jail and on the street savage
Mixed with the robbers, the stress, and the addicts
Mixed with the greed and the guns and the havoc
Mixed with the weed and the pills and the acid
Killing off my people and the media is laughing
Learn about the past but the present is what’s happening
Probation, slavery, pissing for the master
The cops is a gang and they really beat your ass
And the courts is the mob and it’s ran by the cash

[Hook]

[Bridge 2]
I look good on the outside
But messed up in the inside
And everybody got a gun now
I guess I’m ready to die let me fly

[Verse 3]
I really feel like I might not get married
I don’t trust myself so I trust her barely
And I’m not a dog and I’m not a cheetah
But the girls is bending over screaming Lil Beezy
And they don’t tell you that they run around with diseases
Fuck the wrong one, catch AIDS, can’t believe it
Russian roulette everyone watched and cheated
Your main girl high in tax and she fucking Regis
Who wants a million? Most gold diggers do
Say one thing and think another, man they really do
Anything that help you go to hell with the parachute
They really just chirping, talking back like the parrots do
I’m really trying to spit real life like the parents do
Ask bout Lil B and they tell you that I spit the truth
A lot of people don’t understand what I do
And when the world ends just play this song when it’s through
