[Hook:]
Now that you're sweet darling I won't let you get away
Cause you're the one baby the only one for me
You're the one honey, the only one I need

[Verse 1:]
Can I spit a couple of facts and facts
Most of my facts just facts all I
Man all they do is facts
I been looking for a bitch that pretty
Got kids man and he don't pay rent
Bitch you get nosey, and niggas got hoes like OJ come back
Like ok I'm doing, bitch I'm ok
Your life is ruined, how you felt last night
Sick to your stomach most hoes lie like Jerry Springer
You feel me, don't go back to sing it
Go in the grammy
Too complex with your toes bitch you're gonna marry me
OG you feel me
Got that pyrose
Everything shoot bitch, toast!
You know it man I'm not this boy you know me
Rocking hard, like I said
That's your boy lil B
PYT mixtape
You know we're rocking out
Like I said it's your boy Lil B

[Hook:]
Now that you're sweet darling I won't let you get away
Cause you're the one baby the only one for me
You're the one honey, the only one I need

[Verse 2:]
Now I need a bitch that float like this
And roll like this
4 door whip
Blow with the tense
Don't pay rent
Ski mask on

Don't like me
Get low bitch
Straight to the floor

Late night thuggin all night

[Hook:]
Now that you're sweet darling I won't let you get away
Cause you're the one baby the only one for me
You're the one honey, the only one I need
