[Intro: Lil B]
Aye man Bitchmob party aye turn this up!
You know we out here in the streets mane
We goin' stupid mane!
Lil B turn it up!

[Hook: Lil B]
I'm gon' stunt
I'm gon' roll
For my niggas!
I'm gon' sip
I'm gon' drink
I'm gon' smoke
For my Niggas!

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Ima keep it one hundred, I do this for my young niggas
Cause real talk man I know that they love a nigga
I be out here in Berkeley because they love a nigga
I be out in Richmond because they love a nigga
The whole Bay Area filled with drug dealers
Prostitutes and niggas with big houses
Niggas in the hood with no couches
Cigarettes on the floor with the dirty rug
Tv's on the ground with the fruit punch
Niggas love that sound when I pull up
Thank you Basedgod, you can fuck my slut!
I said Thank you Basedgod you can fuck my slut!
East Oakland, niggas fucked up
Helicopters trying to find us
Internationooo, what the fuck you mean
Riding down choppers, looking - clean!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil B]
All my niggas off the post man my niggas hustlin'
Man they love Lil B man he really thuggin'
Niggas respect me cause I came from nothing
Man we pushing cans and we counting money
Make sure not to litter cause I got bitches
In the hood niggas throwing all the trash out
Shout out to Filmore then I sav' out
Shout out to Hunters Point then I mash out
Shout out to Tacoma and Seattle
I need to fuck ten bitches
Them my bitches
Niggas know 'bout the cash roll
Fuck the bitch in the asshole
We gon' stunt till I die
We gon' have fun in the fucking place
Thank you Basedgod no guns in the place
I said Thank You Basedgod no guns in the place

(Hook)
