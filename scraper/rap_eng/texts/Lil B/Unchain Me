[Intro]
Been a long time coming
A lot of pain a lot of triumph
Now I've come to the point where I'm happy

[Verse]
You could break me out the strait jacket
This hip-hop is just play action
I switch off and I keep smashing, I'm a legend, fuck the rap-off
They say I can't do my thing, I'ma build my own lane
You come in, you get ran over, but damn, you sober
I'm the god emcee like Hova
But I'm on another level and my grind is over
Iâ€™ll put the heat on your back like you're sitting in Rovers
And he always prayed to God I'm just bringing him closer
Feel like I'm doing a bid and my mind in Angola
You be food, then I'm cool, they tried to get over
I stopped picking up my phone, they won't get any closer
They watching my every step because I'm living in motion
Seen it in the hood, I can't, feeling is open
They ask for my money every other day
Like I'm asking for something
But when I had nothing they was laughing
They told me that I'd never make it rapping
It brings tears to see I'm on top, but I told you that I'd make it
14, I was living like my life was the pavement
And I wanted to die, couldn't nobody save me
Now I save my own self and I'm on and I'm famous
And I deal with the haters
Ain't nobody gonna take away what I built
Fuck the death threats, small impostors
But really got the love, but they just choosing that option
When I started to live better, they started to hate
I still got the same brain, that caught all the cases
I've still got the same eyes and seen all the places
But I ain't never been faking
And, it's not a game, it's not the Trail Blazers
Throwing shots but we dying
And the rap game, it's the slave trade
No time for meditation, turning into robots
The Devil is money, it's not even human
The people die for a piece of paper, it's so stupid
Man, live however you do it, I guarantee
You see your life as a child and make you at your all
Just make sure that you smile
But dying every day, ma's look at me now
There was hating, but I never stop, I wanted to drop
But BasedGod gave me strength in the Vans
I gotta really notice my chance, make history, man
Three back, I was feeling like "damn!"
You don't know how I felt when I was washing my hands
Off that filth that was around, I'd never be down
One the streets I'm gone, I never be around
'Cause the hood is a lie
Man, you better wake up before you're dead or surprised
I'm just trying to save myself man
For real, but they trapped in the middle
Don't wanna go to school 'cause the teacher's too simple
I just wanna know where I come from
The truth, tell me, before I desolve
It's connected to the woods, the wilderness is my home
The world say I'm bad because of my color
But they don't get the fact that I say that I love you
People given the option to hustle
Just take it and, I swear to God if you're willing to struggle
And once you pass the bottom you gonna get to the top
It's a lot of hate up in the world, just make sure that you watch
