Lil B Intro:
Can't believe this shit man
Motherfuckers is so fake in the game man
I love it though cause it's like my diary, you feel me?
So I really ain't gone forget
I'mma listen back to this music
2 years from now, rare collectible music

Lil B Verse:
Niggas'll lock me in, niggas'll lock me out
Before you speak on God, You better Watch Your Mouth
Straight Waterfront, The Pistol On the Left Side
Feeling like the store, always got the burner
Sing songs like Nat Turner
Niggas think before you move, You'll be a fast learner
Always got direct cash, that's a fast earner
People wonder how I rock steady
Couple moves, couple albums, couple shorts
Couple losses, couple wins, couple deals
Couple haters, couple ballers, couple losers
It's like men like me, I don't want Lex Luger
Niggas torture rap, move the...
Haha, all the thoughts on my mind
Shit, I don't got to rhyme
This is life, came in on every song rhyming
Cause I think with rap I just do, Nike
2 bitches on my dick please don't excite me
But I sell a million records, hard body
Lil Boss, cold as assassin
Got the beef, and he gift wrapped it
Send it to your door step, I'm so old fashioned
One time a nigga played me, had to level up
I Don't get even
I just break even
Maybe a little ammunition make you play this evening
Come up and creep on you
Yea, Reverend, Reverend, yeah
The talk in silence is looked at silence hating
Niggas talk too much, you got to turn the faces
Niggas think he real, but most people faking
I don't ever give chances, you reach to God
Real enough, the more silence the more coffins
Lil B
