[Sample - Sister Part 2 by M83]
Stay away... from me
Handcuffs, the memory sounds

[Intro]
I got so much pain in my heart
This is Lil B
Silent President
The mixtape
Collect all this rare based material from Lil B

[Verse 1]
I done took my last breath, my neck hurt
Wanna focus, but my chest hurt
Is this real or this a game?
I'm asking myself I'm on the, but I battle myself
I feel like a hater, I talk to you later
I hear these voices in my soul, it's so complicated
I just, this is my position, uh, split second
Change a whole mission
Off road, no gas, and off now it's driven
And I'm still off dope, and I made a couple million dollars in the cloud of smoke
Niggas wanna lurk, when you rich or broke
That's why I don't fuck with suckas
Niggas they turn faces when they hands get cold
Niggas be lying like assholes
Ran up, for the cash flow
Ain't trust faces
Fuck faces niggas
Never sit in the front seat when your enemy gazing
Never smoke a nigga weed that fucked your sister
Because low key he thinkin' bout "fuck your sister"
You feel me?
But there, it's time to love in this world amidst us
And I don't know shit, just the things I witness
And this.. to be more, I'm just a beginning
Niggas be coming off the dome
Shit, and I'm even made for scrimmage
And you don't want to play there, this is a man's game
So you take it or leave it
Based world
I'm here for life

[Outro]
