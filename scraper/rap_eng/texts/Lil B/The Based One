[Intro]
Yeah shouts out to Drizzy Drake
You feel me
Shouts out the legend man
Rawest all them, you feel me
I fuck with niggas, man
Lil B, man
Niggas who fuck with me
BasedGod!
You feel me

[Verse]
Why are all these niggas snitchin'
I ain't been to jail since I was 15
You niggas got me fucked up
If you think you really could fuck with me
You niggas on my last win
I started to pay for pussy easily
That's 30 thousand, bitch
That's BasedGod, bitch
Yeah, niggas sit up in that all black
Never lost class or double up when he fall back
This isn't all rap, a wraps up cause with that yellow tape
Goons don't say shit
But he took the eight
Talk about the money saved
And talked about spent
Put it back up in the hood and do something positive
Niggas like me I'm overseas getting Euro pussy
Stackin' up that old bread
Lookin' like an old man
Page upon page nigga, days upond days
Silent President, I can go both ways
New mixtape with the old ass hand
Old Lil B with a ? aim
New BasedGod with a whole new frame
Silent President, nigga

[Outro]
Silent President mixtape, I come again
Lil B fuck with me, nigga
What it do
BasedGod!
