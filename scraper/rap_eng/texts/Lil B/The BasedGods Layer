[Intro]
Welcome, uh, come in, come in, yeah it's the Basedgod, He will be uh coming very shortly, I'm sorry about the long wait that you guys have been having, Lil B he's very busy (Beat Starts), Don't worry come on in, You've never heard of the Basedgod? (laughs)

[Verse]
Court trials, shit I gotta manage
They think if I take my shit off
I'mma wild out
They know I'm gone do it
If it's a smart move I'm gone pursue it
Luda
Gone off Buddha
Store in Cuba
That ain't me
I ain't no court chasing nigga
Stay away far from cops those dope dealers, don't get arrested
I'm having more scrilla
Dollar billas
Equals Killas
I guess I'm killing
Ain't no secrets
Then I peep more secrets
Then you see how I see them
Guarantee your visions even
I swear I'm Capo Capo
Drop the drop off yeah give me that
I ain't petty
But the Glock so heavy
Drop shots, spaghetti
Left or a Leftee
Or a booger you fat or a hefty
I'm a give 'em back raw coke
Your boy too clean like I used bar of soap
No I'm just a Waterfront boy
You just cop my pension
And its written
I always had this vision
Niggas too fake
Couldn't come to grips with
That I made it happen
It's a one in million that I'mma make it rapping
But I'm so sincere
A suit and a tie what I'm suppose to wear
I'm in the zone I'mma go this year
Might blow the ... like remotes in here
Look at me
A smirk on her face like I shouldn't be happy
And I shouldn't keep rapping
But niggas from the dirt
So its, flowers in the grass
I'm having the time of my life
Just flash how I would just pass
This Strobe light
Daytime and I hate night
Only things cool is the breaklight
What I sold they don't get the pace right
Only god knows what my day like
The whole world knows what I stand for
I got honor in my words
I demand more... Peace
I want to make a place for the people
I want to show y'all that we all are even
I want to be a star no hollywood
Your dreams come true it's all good
Just think about it
What you want to do you gone do
And its all those moves, its all those things, its all those dudes
Think about it man
Think all those- man them lives going to change
Dream more doors then you do the pain
A lot of people sleep out in the rain
We tend to forget what we don't see
So if you disappear tomorrow
Would you think about me
Or would you think about me

[Outro]
Ah So you finally met Lil B, huh, How was it? It wasn't as bad as you thought it would be. Come outside the BasedGod's here Yes! This is amazing. Look at his face he's so happy. Close the door we must leave. We must leave the BasedGod now. Let him, Let him rest, Let him be
