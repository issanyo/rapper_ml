Welcome, It's Lil B
Illusions of Grandeur
Based World, we did it!
Double XL Freshman

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Super Saiyan them guys laying
I'm caking up, sitting behind suckers
Your time is up, Fatal Attraction
My rapping equal like I'm rap god
Came from the block-
Same hood they strip you them blocks
Same time getting chased by them cops
That's when the prayers for you stop
I'm getting money
Paying off the officers off duty, with a pistol
When niggas hit you from 30 feet away, like sky missiles
I miss you, your family miss you
Lemme be at peace with real niggas and dime bitches
Better call them all and line up in slaughter
Get em off the border
Ship em off the water uh
Its ya orders on top of orders
Let me do a rap game:
New music, new rapper, new fusion
Hip hop need me, need me, like producers
Lil B vicious: game time
I got these swishers same time I fuck these bitches
We still fuck these bitches, but these suckas' bitches
Niggas bitches, envy bitches
Mind ya own business
Money give ya motion sickness
Own family can't trust em
I dont know whats real, be a soul
(???)
Move still
Powers in my body laugh at me -
I look beside to grab it off
Nigga the definition is bullshit:
Ain't hard, because niggas kill ya
Pillow talk these bitches while you off these pills
I'm the realest nigga to do it
Bringing rap alive again again again
And no trap or die
I ain't up on that block sellin that Calcutta
I'd rather write a verse and give game to my lil niggas
I'd rather be the Based God nigga than anybody
Seen the bottom ground, past forget about it
Used to sell cars: owned a car lot
No religion just keys - the whip hot
Found out, hatin, the pen drop, nigga hit the lot
Now I go and cop, strive for personal excellence
No success - success is what they see: excellence in yourself
I got to be it: be the best, stress free with how I do nigga
It's just me
I'm fabulous Lil B
