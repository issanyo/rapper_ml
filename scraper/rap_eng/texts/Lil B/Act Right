(Intro: Lil B)
Imma keep it 100 man, you know what I'm saying, I done had them real problems before, I ain't gon' lie, What if you done really woke up and your heart was hurting, Cause you like man, niggas don't fuck with me and you gotta handle some problems

(Verse 1: Lil B)
Fuck you sucka ass niggas
Keep up the shit and Imma hit you with the Glock
Ain't no love round here Lil Bitch
Niggas get raped for them motherfucking bricks
Ain't no love for them niggas in the hood
Let's keep it real and Let's straight facts
Who really care if a nigga get murdered?
Who really care if a nigga get jacked?
Don't nobody, Let's stay facts
Try to put you down when your skin turned black
Talking for myself, nigga, that's just how I feel
Niggas get killed, over dolla bills
Fuck the world, that's just how I feel
Fuck everybody, that's just how I feel
Don't love me, but I love you
Cross me over, then it's fuck you too
Niggas get shot and they laughing at you
Niggas get killed and they looking at me
Like, what's wrong with you
What's wrong with the hood
Don't nobody take time to work things out
Niggas want to shoot, niggas want to kill
Fuck them niggas, that's how I feel
That's how I feel
I'm like Fuck them niggas, man, that's how I feel

Get your act together, man
