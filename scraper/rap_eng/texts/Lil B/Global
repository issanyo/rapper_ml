[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen]
Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- G- G- Go Global
Now get down in this pretty world, pretty world, with your pretty friends
Get down with those pretty girls and do, and do your pretty dance
Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- G- G- Go Global
Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- G- G- Go Global
Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- G- G- Go Global
Now get down in this pretty world, pretty world, with your pretty friends
Now get down in this pretty world, pretty world, with your pretty friends
Get down

[Verse 1: The BasedGod]
Bitch, always been global
Push weight I ain't ever been local
Out of state campaign, that's your main thang
And I'm still yellin' out brrrangadang
I'm like a rock star, but I got bars
Strapped in the front like a cop car
Go to sleep rich, wake up rich
Getting out of pocket, so I slapped a bitch
You ain't even gotta like it, but it's like that
Like the bitch, so she come right back
She used to make it roll down the pole
Tryna watch this money hit the floor
She be going dumb like she on blow
International like UFO
I'm a Jacka like Joe Blow
I'm Messy Marv like Fillmore
Get free bands like Future
In the Tesla with the doors up
A million dollar cash make you throw it up
All these bad bitches just go nuts
All these bad bitches just go dumb
All these bad bitches just go dumb
Yeah man, like I said, it's your boy Lil B, we be turnin' up

[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen]
Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- G- G- Go Global
Now get down in this pretty world, pretty world, with your pretty friends
Get down with those pretty girls and do, and do your pretty dance
Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- G- G- Go Global
Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- G- G- Go Global
Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- G- G- Go Global
Now get down in this pretty world, pretty world, with your pretty friends
Get down in this pretty world, pretty world, with your pretty friends
Down

[Verse 2: The BasedGod]
The party, I wanna go
Get rich, yes hoe
With my niggas in the cut, with that shit, light it up
Put my hands up in the air
Goin' crazy, I don't care (I don't care)
I don't care (let's go, let's go)
Bitch, I'm feeling like Jay-Z
Bitch, I'm feeling like Master P
Fresh off the boat with a [?]
Trya watch a stripper booty float
Girl, do what you do
Tell the truth, I ain't mad at you
Huh, no means no
I got too many bitches, I don't know
Help me out, let's go crazy in this damn house
All my frat boys turn up
Spring break, bitches wanna fuck
India got a lot of bitches
Sri Lanka got a lot of bitches
Thailand got a lot of bitches
Germany, USA, Brazil

[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen]
Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- G- G- Go Global
Now get down in this pretty world, pretty world, with your pretty friends
Get down with those pretty girls and do, and do your pretty dance
Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- G- G- Go Global
Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- G- G- Go Global
Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- G- G- Go Global
Now get down in this pretty world, pretty world, with your pretty friends
Get down in this pretty world, pretty world, with your pretty friends
Get down

[Verse 3: iLoveMakonnen]
My best mates live out in Melbourne
I'm out west, smoking on the best
The sherm that you probably, you want (uh)
The girls round 'em, I make them hot
And I'm like the captain all around the planet
Me and Lieutenant Ollie, we, we make it happen
Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- Go Global
I drink blue bottle water, global
Rock the local, everyday
Makin' so much, I could buy the USA
So get down in this pretty world
And do your pretty dance
And get down with those pretty girls
Do your pretty dance and get down

[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen]
Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- G- G- Go Global
Now get down in this pretty world, pretty world, with your pretty friends
Get down with those pretty girls and do, and do your pretty dance
Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- G- G- Go Global
Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- G- G- Go Global
Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- Go- G- G- Go Global
Now get down in this pretty world, pretty world, with your pretty friends
Get down in this pretty world, pretty world, with your pretty friends
Get down
