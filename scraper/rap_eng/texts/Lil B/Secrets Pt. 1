[Hook]
Break it down
I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow no they better not dare

[Verse 1]
When I see you walk up I dig your complexion
I was with my girlfriend and you was with your boyfriend
We pass by, I could tell it in your eyes
That you wanna taste this dick, you was looking from the side
It caught me off guard, I'm not a lifeguard
But I will get wet, if I'm diving in your thighs
So I try to say hi, without even saying words
Cold body language, hot with the swerve
I must have nerve, to think about cheatin'
Called me next weekend, and then I started cheesin'
Behind his back, I was throwing love signs
She caught a couple words, and she threw em right back at me (Yeah)
And then I'm lookin' at her body, her man don't know that we finna be naughty
Unlock her heart with the keys and the money
Sendin' two hearts, so I go to church Sunday (Yeah)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
So I get to her doorstep, she lookin' so flawless
She walked outside and she lookin' so gorgeous
Had my backpack, with a bag full of condoms
A couple orange juice, and a blunt for the grindin'
She took my hand and she lookin' like her mama
I seen a few pictures, hanging by the light and
Smooth like lightnin', surprised by my manners
Finna hit the room, so I gotta get the camera
She took off my shirt, I know I'm finna ram her
Like the corner back, I couldn't fuckin' jam her
Thinkin' to myself, how I got it so fast
I deserve a fuckin' belt mayne, get that fuckin' cash b
So I finna bust a nut now
Lookin' in her eyes, and I'm finna lay the girl down
Guess what now, in her arms I fell asleep
And I feel like I'm slippin', but it's where it gets deep baby (Yeah)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And I wake from the place of her dream state
Hear a few doorknocks, now I couldn't think straight
Looked up at the girl, she was lookin' kinda frantic
Cheatin' on her boyfriend, with me she romancin'
Dude walked in, with his hand on his Hanson
God damn, now I gotta think about the damage
Looked at his face, and I seen he wasn't laughin'
He walked to his bitch, and he started beatin' on her ass and
And then he starting crying, cause the pain that he ____
Pulled out a gun, and his pistol whipped his chick
And he said that I'm next and he choppin' off my dick
And I couldn't even think cause, what I seen next cause
He shot her in the face and two times in the neck
He cocked back his gun and aimed it my way
Said you finna fuck my bitch and I'm finna shoot you in the face b
And now I'm dead
