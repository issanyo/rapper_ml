[Intro]
Yeah baby
It's been a while
Since we've been together
I understand, you never had a man like me before

[Verse 1 : Lil B]
See you never met a dude like me before
Like the heels on the girls and the jeans, cause we on
And everytime I'm with her, I spend my dough
See you never met a dude like me before

Everytime I'm outside I pump my brake
Everytime I think about it girl you know I can't wait
And everytime we together I see the spot
She was calling on my name then I took her to the top
Oh, baby please

[Hook]
You can call me what you want, girl
You can call me what you want
Uh, you can call me what you want, baby
You can call me what you want
You can call me what you want, girl
You can call me what you want
Uh, you can call me what you want, baby
You can call me what you want

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Put a price on her I can't afford
Her skin so soft, I can touch her soul
If I put a ring on, she's mine fo sho
Anything that you want, girl meet me at home
Oh, baby please

[Hook]
You can call me what you want, girl
You can call me what you want
You can call me what you want, girl
You can call me what you want
You can call me what you want, baby
You can call me what you want
You can call me what you want, girl
You can call me what you want

[Verse 3: Lil B]
Everytime I dream, I see the place
I'm like a Aston Martin, girl you know I can't wait
Everytime she sees me, her temperature drops
Just tell me how long, I can drive you to your spot
Oh, baby please

[Hook]
You can call me what you want, girl
You can call me what you want
You can call me what you want, baby
You can call me what you want
You can call me what you want, girl
You can call me what you want
You can call me what you want, baby
You can call me what you want
Baby. please
You can call me what you want, girl
You can call me what you want
You can call me what you want, baby
You can call me what you want
