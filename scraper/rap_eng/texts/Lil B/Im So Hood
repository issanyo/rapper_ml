We made it uh, yeah, uh Let these niggas rock up, you know what I'm saying, holla at me for a second, What you got nigga? What you got nigga? It's Lil B bitch, yeah, It's Lil B bitch, yeah

(Verse 1: Lil B)
We made it
When you coke on the shelf
It's made, you niggas in the mansion
It's made, and you got the coke lab
And it's break, when you seeing niggas rob
No order in the game and I'm snatching niggas kids
Make them pay me, then I rob him
He gon' pay me again
He gon' pay with his life
He gon' owe me to dust
My society is trying me
I see understand and I see my position is a story
I'm a mystery
God, put my gun in the car
My car it stay in reverse
Park the car in the park
I was shooting that sucka
I was missing that snitch
Built in, you know what I'm saying
I'm tired of writing
Putting money in the tires, niggas back the fuck up
Imma show you bout the gun law
Imma show you how the guns spar
Imma show you bout these young laws
And Imma show you how we niggas get it twisted
Imma show you why my niggas hit-
Nah, nah we outchea
I invest in that
Imma take that back
Imma cook that crack
And Imma make it flip

(Hook: Lil B)
All my niggas, All my niggas let's split this money
And watch are dope get bigger
All my niggas, All my niggas, All my niggas, All my niggas let's split this money
And watch are dope get bigger
All my niggas, All my niggas, All my niggas, All my niggas let's split this money
And watch are dope get bigger

(Verse 2: Lil B)
I ain't gon' lie, you a pro my nigga
Pushing key like me, let's go my nigga
I lived that life and Imma tell you bout me
Niggas looking on the streets
Man, I'm not in the street
I'm in the streetS
I'm mainstream, hit 'em with the black beam
Snort this up and Imma show you what the sh- lean
Imma show you how them sax be
Imma show you bout them pussy ass hallways
I'm so hood
