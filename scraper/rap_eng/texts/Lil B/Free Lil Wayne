[Intro]
Lil B for Lil Boss bitch
Yea yea nigga I'm in this motherfucker
Free Lil Wayne, ya feel me
Ay man, Lil B, I done brought back rap
Nigga I am rap bitch

[Verse 1]
BasedGod bitches love, niggas hate me
Everyday stay up, BET I'm in the basement
Lil Boss, niggas know about my issue
30 on my hand and I'm guaranteed to hit you
Ex-robber, ex-thief, ex-felon
Niggas who you run with, guaranteed he telling
Bruh know that I paid about 50
Hitman coming straight to your city
AR-15 with the laser
Hand grenades, open shop, then erase ya
You know I'm here, when I'm mad I bring the blues
50 on my dick bitch it's all on you
Niggas mad, fuck them up then bust
Shots off the rip, flicka-flame then aim
Never sold that crack cocaine
But best believe I'm still HB like Lil Wayne
I wear tiny pants niggas still call me gay
Tiny shirts make your ass catch that fade
Gangsters, AK's and bananas
I keep my family close, suckers you can handle

[Hook]

Ward of the state, can't tell yall what happened
Suckas choose
Off top bring the blues
30 on my dick cause lil wodie on the news
20 on my dick cause I'm in the New York Times
Only goon nigga crossed over, respect my mind
Wrote a fucking book at 19 years old
Niggas hate on me even with a heart of gold
Now these suckers mad, motherfucker made a monster
Bulletproof vests, AK's, and rocket launchers
Pay my rent, and never pay my bitch neither
Iced out watch came straight from the freezer
Niggas said that I'll never make it rapping
And if I don't I'm snorting dope in every trap
And if I don't I'm coming straight for the cut
Fuck with Lil B wodie get his head bust

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Dudes know to uh respect my fucking mind
Girls know off top bitch I'm blind
No hate, I can't see you niggas firing
Free Lil Wayne, Cash Money sling that iron
Came up, niggas young but I'm ready
Hate on me your head looking like spaghetti
I'm not a gangster, I'm a young hypocrite
I don't know myself so I'm yelling suck my dick
I'm bringing pain, off top slinging iron
Free Young Turk, BasedGod, and Lil Wayne nigga
Bitch I bring the pain
