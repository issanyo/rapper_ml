[Verse]
Bitch I say bitch you don’t know me
You don't know me hoe you don't know me
I might as well be hang
Bitch you bitch you don’t know me
You know what I’m saying
Why these bitches playin why these bitches playing
Slap a bitch you don’t know about money
Bitch try to kiss me ya’ll miss me
I took the president bitch I’m Lil B
Hit you with that dope sack
Bitch I’m going to run it back
Bitch I’m the quarterback
I throw you a pass bitch trying to take sack
I might knock her out cry baby ass niggers
Tax you in the fucking drought
Taxing these suckers
That goes off dodging you must be telling
I ain’t rodger bitch about money
Bitch about basedGod bitch trying to hold
The underground I might hit a cracker
I might hit a nigga I might hit a bitch
Would that make me real street nigga
I never met Jay Z I come up with 20 people
Now It’s about 4 people
Taking bitches out with that mack on the stove
Bitch sellin dope bitch selling hoe
Tiny search tiny pants taking bitches home
But around town I’m the kid
Back section 56 I look like Glenn Close
Fucked a couple bitches and I thanked myself
I never got close but I told the bitch thanks
The bitch don’t know me I might as well be hang
The bitch never met me I might as well be hang
Hold on me for real you know what I’m saying
You might as well be afraid you know what I mean
The bitch don’t know me It’s your boy Lil Boss
Thug got pissed off maybe one day though
You know what I’m saying
