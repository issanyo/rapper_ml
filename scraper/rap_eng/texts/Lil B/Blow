[Intro]
You know welcome to this
05 Fuck Em mixtape
Bay area mind state
West coast heart
East coast brain
South side soul
Mid west surroundings
Worldwide lifestyle

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Want my money
And i want it in singles
Addicted to the chips, the cheese
You get my steelo
My love is real to me and you not equal
My brodies in the cut
Looking for their people
Staring at people
I love life because i love the people
Niggas act fake, i don't hear that
Your like a mime
My movies real, your movies lies
I don't fantasize with mirror
Got my life straight
Start paying attention
I was so cocky, couldn't even look at myself
This real talk, i felt like i was cheating
At this plate, i'm thinking about the evening
How my family eating
Boss moves put me at the top shelf
I'm the smoothest gangsta
Put you right on the back
Come get a massage
Shotgun give em a size
I'm selling dope like the jack
I'm not lying
My best friend is the plastic rabbit

[Bridge]
You know what i'm sayin
05 Fuck Em mind state
Lil B on that grind state shit
Yea, you feel me?
I'm selling dope bitch
So dope, 05 Fuck Em
05 Fuck Em mixtape
Lil B man, them niggas
Can't fuck with you
You know what i'm sayin

[Verse 2: Lil B]
I'm a nerd and i look like a thug
I beat my bitch up
And go sell some drugs
I'm American and i say it proud
I'm staying in the cut like
A flagrant foul
Who gone play me now?
And who gone pay me later?
I'm not no fucking pimp
I'm a fucking player
Better yet im a young fucking mayor
Conversations with the mayor
Lil B, he wasn't there
Lil B, told me things
There people under the stairs
Pass the bleachers out in the
Stadium, i'm there
Ya feel me, nigga?
I'm a mack for real
Got stacks for real
Stack mills for real
Bitch, don't get killed for real
Watch every day moves
Got them cameras, 20 guns
That's just how i get down, bitch
And no pun intended
RIP Big Pun, that was intended

[Outro]
I love ya'll man
Shouts out
05 Fuck Em mixtape
RIP Big Pun nigga
Lil  B
