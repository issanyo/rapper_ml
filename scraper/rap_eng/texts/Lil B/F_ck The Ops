F*ck the police!
Motherf*ck the Ops!
Bro, I'm down for the street
I'm like 10 feet deep
Task force with the B, bitch
Them streets run deep
I'm not doing nothing illegal
Still I get pulled over
I wear my suit with the black bentley
I'm a finna by an island flexing baby bentley
I f*ck for real cops, not the fake cops
Fake cops in the hood taking over blocks
Fake cops f*ckin hoes like the streets do
Middle fingers up if they hate on you
F*ck the police!
Motherf*ck the Ops!
Got pulled over last week
No shirt, beenie cap, gold teeth
I look kind of weird when I'm driving
He act like I'm riding with that shawty
Don't let me have a girl in the front
They thinking I'm f*cking hoes in the murk
I hate fake cops 'cause they judge me
I ain't got no drugs and I pay my taxes
I ain't got no ratchets, I ain't baggin
I respect you and I know my right
I ain't no fake rapper, this is rap money
No trap money, just rap money
God told me that I got to keep it better
Top notch, nigga I love the struggle
Pay cops, me tryin to flex
Real cops, I salute real respect
F*ck the police!
Motherf*ck the Ops!
