Spent ten bands in a drought

She gave me her pussy and I bought that house
She got bad credit so I hit that mouth
Lot of broke bitches, pick 'em out
Bitch got wood and a stick in her house
She on her foreclosure, I'm cashin' out

Feel me? Bitch, I'm cashin' out
Need the rent paid at that dirty-ass house?
Hit me with that shit, ho, I'm bankin' out

Spent a hunnid bands and I ain't look back twice
Feel me? Throw that rice over my shoulder
I'm trickin' off bands and shippin' boulders
