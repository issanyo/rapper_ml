[Hook: Lil B]
Girl you so posh, you so posh
Ooh girl you so posh, you so posh
Girl you so posh, you so posh
Mm you so posh, you so posh

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Young Basedgod came in with the patience
She be doing her own thing, she probably on vacation
She be working hard, I'm like bitch I'm trying skating
Skoo Skoo like  Motown, hot like Cajun
Girl you look so good, I'm tryna fuck, no waiting
Take you on a date we can go different places
Why you got your purse on, you know that I'm paying
You should wear that lipstick
Then we out to kick it
Buy her what you wanted and she doesn't miss me
Buy her what she wanted and she doesn't miss me
I said: I buy her what she wanted and she doesn't miss me
I said: I Buy her what she wanted and she don't miss me
BasedGod!

[Hook]
I see you baby

[Verse 2: Lil B]
You look like Oah
With that ark like Noah
She want to go shopping, She want to go travel
Girl you so posh, She got high standards
She won't suck my dick until I buy her a new car
Girl you so posh, I'm breaking bread I swear to god
Give me a little pussy and I will damn near lose my job
Fucked her in the ass and I told the bitch to go shop
Fucked her in the mouth then I bought the ho a drop top
