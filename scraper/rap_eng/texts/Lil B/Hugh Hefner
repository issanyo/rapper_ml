Yeah, young Hugh Hefner
Shouts out to Hugh Hefner's son too
You feel me?
Red Flame

Playboy mansion. Paris Hilton passin me
Headed to the grotto. Based God with the gold teeth
You see me posted with the models
Bitches try to pull me in the pool
Psychedelic drugs; Carlton is next to me
Bill O' Reilly taking ecstasy
Hugh Hefner, know the secrets
Hip-hop keep 'em
Under the rug
I'm thinking under the mat
Trapped in the closet. MF DOOM
Without being fed by the spoon
Yeah. Most people say about my music
They close-minded and swaggerless
What you see in the building shit
I imagine shit
It's like I'm in the water 'neath where his paddle is
I'm Hugh Hefner, gotta represent
The real struggle out of Africa, they sleep in tents
Gotta go to get humble. Go there, you get crumbled
Niggas like me, I ball and don't fumble
We juggle this thing we call life, wassup?

Hugh Hefner
Aight, that nigga Curren$y like Michael Knight
I'm like
Hugh Hefner, Hugh Hefner, Hugh Hefner
SKOOBIDOOPIDOOPADOOP!

Ski-di-blapblapblapblap, where my bitches?
Red Flame nigga

My life's in a box, I stop
Take a second to look. I move, I rock
Feelin' like The Pharcyde
Niggas think your petty crimes are small time
Thinkin' big time like a movie
Man, I'm so groovy
Austin Power
Cannabis Club card in my possession
Cops pull me over, don't stress it
Hugh Hefner in the vehicle, I got protection
Niggas know that the opposition against me
Come prepared like fast food
Two dues are past average
Haters' brain like cabbage
Niggas grow up, pfft
You picked the balcony? That's a plan
Got the shotgun like Malcom X, strapped up, don't stress
Keep it positive, none the less we keep it safe
Like sex, bunnies on my ranch
Young Hugh Hefner bitch

Yeah man, shouts out to DJ Wrexx
Also at the Playboy mansion, DJ'ing his ass off
Shouts out to the Fader magazine
Pitchfork.com for holding me down

Hello Mr. Senator, we got LSD cause we hipsters
Please just remember us and get your ass like the enemas
Volkswagen battle truck, we call it The Love Van
Ariel Pink. Chromeo
Almost got the Holy Ghost
Daft Punk on my DVD
Tourin' around the world like me
Feelin' like Fader Magazine
Pitchfork.com with Ray Ban's on
Arcade Fire, Neighborhood #1
I'm from the hood so I'm like the sun
You get it? Never run
We run the game bitch
*slurs words*

This is a victory for all the rebels
