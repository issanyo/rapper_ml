Smoke weed, roll swishers
Tour bus, full of pretty bitches
Naked bitches, maskurating
3 girls kissing, masterbating
If you he-man, I'm skeletor
Star trakching, bout to teleport
Like spocks ears, sip na beers
Caviar the pilot about to park the leer
I got that 6.38 nigga hanging by my nutsack
Catch you at the restaurant, wear your steak like a hat
Delay the blow back, on the pearce 90
It's blue and green boy, right up in the mazi
Ball, swag, ball, swag, ball, swag, ball
Trap, trap, trap, swag, trap, swag, trap
Ball, swag, ball, swag, ball, swag
Nigga trap, trap, swag, trap, swag, swag

Fuck the drama, fuck your baby momma
On her period, bloody up the condom
From where the beam steel aluminum satin and your on it
Bitch pussy so loose I could fit my arm in
Chop the pill in half, save the other half
It ain't kicked in so I pop the other half
Drunk a 40 took it with no fucking substance
Smoke blunt after blunt till no buzz left
Shitting on these niggas, no prune juice
88 cudi, moon roof
Stay strapped up, moon boots
In any hood I don't here who are you

Ice, wrist, 10, g's
Damn, nigga, you doin, your thang
Young, nigga, old, bitch
New, car, new, bitch
50, thousand, for, show
Danks, sky, out the, door
New, watch, new, house
Hood, nigga, iced, out
Tiny, shirts, tiny, jeans
Westside, nigga, rich
Bentley, coupe, 200, stacks
Buy a, bitch, 5, stacks
