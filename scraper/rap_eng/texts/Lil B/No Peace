Illusions of Grandeur mixtape, you feel me
What's the definition?
Niggas dyin' and they livin'
Tryna find peace but the word on the streets that we dyin' over blocks and drugs
Ain't no peace in slums
Yeah, yeah ya mind on the money but the money is fake
You could ask how I say that, I'm on the paper chase
But really, moneys only for the exchange for what you want
Don't live for it just live it up
My niggas dyin' everyday for the simple stuff
Let movies get to em actin' like he rough
It all starts somewhere, it takes one to know one
Street level hustlers set all the examples
But they livin' life fast sex, money and gamblin'
Niggas here goin' to jail cells where they landed
Uhh, 80 years, man this shit is real
He was the first time offending the lawyer the deal
He didn't wanna tell the truth cuz he was scared they'd be at him
He went to jail for 4 dates with a 7
He don't know how it feels to lose something forever
Most people die in the hood and was designed for stretchers
Take second out of the day thinkin' about your partners
Niggas older than me still bangin' sets with them choppers
Yeah I love the hood, but I ain't gonna die for it
Nigga you wouldn't die for me, and you and I know it
Now, I don't wanna prove myself to you or nobody
Took the game nigga and I, rap about it
Master P like said nigga, "I'm bout it bout it"
Just give me, 5 mics on the source, cali cali
Niggas in Cali lay on the floor with the 50 cali
Blowin' on the maui, 50
Cuz around here, leave you on the ground nigga with them dum dums
Chop em down mothafucka, chop em down commander
You niggas is some faggets

Hahaha nigga got a lil angry at the end, you feel me
Niggas die everyday tryna find the peace
You know that's real shit
What's the definition?
Niggas dyin' and they livin'
What's the definition?
Niggas dyin' and they livin'
Tryna find peace but the word on the streets that we dyin' over blocks and drugs
Ain't no peace in slums
One time what's the definition?
Niggas dyin' and they livin'
Tryna find peace but the word on the streets that we dyin' over blocks and drugs
Ain't no peace in slums
