[Intro]
I ain’t gon’ lie, you feel me
I see a lot of yall pussies still talkin' shit up in the streets
You feel me, a muthafucka still out here
You feel me, so I'mma see ya when I see ya
Ya know what it do, man
And I might have to take ya, you heard me

[Hook]
I'mma go 'round robbin', I'mma go out shoppin' (x4)

[Verse 1]
Young Basedgod hit that shop with that .30 (Basedgod)
Call me Mr Clean ‘cause I’m up too early (Damn)
I’m a aggravated felon and you know I gets durty
Be up up in the party, lookin' like James Worthy (James Worthy)
Hit that cooking dance with the gun in my pocket
Fuck what ya heard, bitch, I still tote the rocket (Tote the rocket)
Fuck every sucka, bitch, I’m strapped with that yeti
I’m a fuckin' bitch and I dare you to come see me (Pow!)
I know you suckas plottin', third eye watchin'
Two eyes on my fuckin' neck ‘cause I’m cautious
Call me Mr Dog ‘cause I lick everything (Damn, Dayummm)
Super dope fiend, catch me on your damn bed (Aaaaahh)
And I don’t want no pussy, bitch, I want some damn bread
Call me “Marcus Basedgod”; I fucked her in the ass (In da azz)
I got a problem, I think I’m a robber
I’m facing 40 years.. Where’s Johnny Cochran?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I’m rappin' like 2 Chainz (Ahhhh!)
I might take yo chain (Mmmmmm)
Not talkin' ‘bout 2 Chainz (Aaaahh)
I’M TALKING BOUT ERRYBODY
I’m riding around with that shotty
I’m riding around with that bitch
Not talkin' ‘bout that lick
Im talkin' ‘bout I’m sick (BASED GOD)
I hold that .50 Mag with the safety (Aaaaahhh)
Hunnit grand show, just to show you can’t play me
Young Basedgod old-school, I'mma scrape ‘em (Woop, woop)
Yes I’m a nerd, but I’m thuggin' so heavily
Faced 36 and I felt like Macho Man
Got out the game ‘cause I’m Ultimate Thuggin'
Ain’t nobody winning when you out here hustlin'
56 bitches on my dick ‘cause I’m strugglin' (Basedgod!)

[Hook]
I'mma go 'round robbin'
I'mma go 'round robbin', I'mma go out shoppin' (x4)
