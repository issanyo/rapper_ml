[Intro]
So today I feel like we need to stop the war
I want to take the flag down today man
No more separation
I'm taking the flag down in the house today
No more white house, no more black house, no any house
Its the base house
I'm taking all the flags down
Yeah its a new day and age, no more flags

[Verse 1]
I took my flag down today, the world is over
Call back all the soldiers, keep you 'posure
For a brighter day, only one step closer
Its a whole lot of weight with the world on your shoulders
I know Lil B, you're getting older
That life that you live something like a rollercoaster
How you keep on rocking, and never fall over
Even when the game over, you game over everybody
They game over, I'm like J Hova
Coming with the quick marine soldiers
Coming up quick with the clips and green doja
He who fail, the one that act colder
No tolerance to hold the mac, blow ya
Roll with C4, I know I might told ya
Send your ass up to heaven
All dogs go to heaven
Never (?) sitting back counting blessings

[Verse 2]
At the top of the world I don't need cocaine
Rich man high, I'm broker like real estate
Dudes fuck you over, and they play the wait
I move bags of caine through me
Trying to eyeball me
Right there, no need on the blocks
Niggas looking like, where we eat
I'm looking back like shit where ya'll sleep
There's no come ups, drugs is bundled up
The guns in the wall are the government's stuff
But Imma tell you
The media run and support it
People stealing your funds, stealing your life
Make you feel like you're needing a gun
Game, no need for one
Shit there's no need to run
Its all in fun
You got one life, don't drop none
I plan to keep it real, just like 2Pac's son
I got a house in New Orleans
Had to cop one next to some trailers
We all is neighbors
Keep it humble, my suitcase filled with paper
Pass my business card around the town
Everybody know me, good or bad
Need time to myself, does that make me sad
I wanna keep it real, that's my only purpose
See his life fade away and he ain't have no jersey
People walk on my soul and I ain't eat on Thursday
Things change overnight, bounce back with a purpose
The freight train taught me how to move city to city
People in my ear, how they do it with me
Just a nomad, different cities
Disqualified as a thug
I hear the wind blow every time I light my blunt
All spiritual stuff, go connect with the earth
I show you what this life's worth
I got out the stand and started playing in dirt
Realized its all part of the earth
Lil B

[Outro]
We all a part of the system
Just watch how you use your own vision
