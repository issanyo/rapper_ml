[Verse]
All my life I was slanging keys
Flipped a couple packs and I slang the weed
Mr. Dope man that's the thing to be
Fucks a couple packs then I flex in three
Crackhead shawty don't fuck with me
Riding dope man and I made them bleed
Niggas getting mad, don't get mad at me
Bitch, I was slanging keys
Flipped a couple packs and I slang the weed
And they know about the tan do
Hollywood parties serving crack ho
You know what I'm saying

Mothafuckas lips white
Tryna see they telescope
I'm tryna get hype tryna flex dirty crack
And I'm thinking I'm Mr. Doubt Fire
