[Verse 1]
Niggas hating on me today
What the fuck do I got to say (What)
Niggas talking down on me
Fuck you and your place (Bop)
Niggas don't know my life, no they don't know my pain (BasedGod, BasedGod)
No one talk about me everyday
So many people turn their back, it's just normal (Huh)
So many niggas fake, I can't fuck with 'em [?] (Disown 'em)
Take a nigga out quick with that chop (Hah)
They play with me, boy I swear to God
