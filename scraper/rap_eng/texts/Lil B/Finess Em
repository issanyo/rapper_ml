[Intro]
All I could do is think about
Famous struggle ya know what I'm saying
Never came easy know what I mean
Born in to the struggle
Made it off the hustle know what I'm saying
It's your boy Lil B
Shout out to the world you feel me
Yeah man it's a good look out here today man
Getting to what we got to, doing what we got to
No shame in my game

[Verse 1]
You can't tear a brick down like you built it up
Each piece made the wall I keep standing up
Same way you made it you gonna let it down
My life time built some houses and they fell down
Met a couple bitches see if they keep it real
Ready for the upset I know the deal
My dreams came true now I'm chasing things
Hoe got small dreams trying to cop the mall
Hoes don't got no dreams I'm knock the bitch out
Sucker niggas fuck their moms house
Dad gone but don't mean he not there
My pops like me I'm not there but I'm right here
How bad you really want it
Coke pass out
Real nigga's make it and the cash out
Money and staying real is the best feeling
Smashing through my problems is lord willing

[Chorus]
I can't fuck with suckers I don't respect them
You got me fucked up, I just finesse them
I can't fuck with suckers I don't respect them
You got me fucked up, I just finesse them
Fuck suckers I can't respect it
You got me fucked up, I just finesse them
Fuck suckers I can't respect it
You got me fucked up, I just finesse them

[Verse 2]
I'm let these haters kill they self with their own gun
No pain no gain winning no fun
You nigga's don't talk beef you talking the wrong thing
All my nigga's hit licks we just took the wrong chain
A business man running through your brain
Show you bitches bout this pain
I'm flash on nigga's cause they don't deserve it
Crackheads so fake, clowns and curtains
I'm keep doing me and beef is certain
Suckers won't change me I'm keep on learning
You won't do yourself, you won't even try
Staying in bed all day that's how you die
These haters want you sleep, sleep on me I'm standing up
It's a process you can't fly get cooled up
I used to ride small bikes now I'm pushing big wheels
Always said I'ma fail, who is forreal

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Back against the wall wanna see me sweat
Won't follow they dreams they got no respect
Some started off here, some started from there
I ain't ever been scared my whole life was rare
Came up from hitting licks like my job was that
Stunna man selling crack, my life was wack
Trying to see my nigga's rich so we won't complain
Y'all don't want no pain, you don't see the rain
I don't give a fuck my life is fucked up from the start
Trying to take away my heart, fuck me in the dark
I'ma kill you bitch nigga's, you ghost on my mark
When my gun go off Imma take your life
You nigga's doing what's wrong Imma do what's right
Suckers stay lying, it's fuck your life
This is all real music, I'm not a rapper
Sitting behind the black man with his hat tipped backwards

[Chorus]
