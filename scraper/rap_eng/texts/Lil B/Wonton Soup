[Intro]
Oh my god Based God!
You could fuck my bitch, Based God!
You swag to the maximum
Swag 100 thousand, 100 trillion! Oh god damn Based God!

[Chorus]
Hopped up in my car (swag!) then I drop my roof
Wet like wonton soup. That's just how I do (swag!)
Then I park my car, then I fuck your bitch
Eat that wonton soup, wet like wonton soup

[Verse 1]
Eat the cake like Anna Mae
Young Based God and I been doin my thing
Take my shirt off and the girls go insane
Four diamond rings, two big-ass chains
Eat that wonton soup I got the cash like chang chang chang
Bitches suck my dick because I cum like 36 ways
AK-47 leave that bitch with no fucking name
Call my main bitch and she stay giving me brain
Put that bitch to shame, violate that brain
Young Based God dope my bitch like I'm cocaine
Bitches snort my ring, that crackpipe like my chain
Found a dope man, I ride that bitch like Ace of Spades
Ho don't play that game!

Bitch don't give no fuck, that's why I fuck her in the face
Fuck you suckers' heads then I ask her what's her name
Based God, man

[Chorus]
Hopped up in my car (swag!) then I drop my roof
Wet like wonton soup. That's just how I do (swag!)
Then I park my car, then I fuck your bitch
Eat that wonton soup, wet like wonton soup
