[Verse 1]
Looking for a girl that likes them boys
Turn this up, don't care about the noise
Oakland get loud
New York get loud
Mardi Gras get loud
Lift your leg up and twerk it  for the crowd
Take it to the floor, put the money on the ground
All the strippers get the money off the ground

Work it, work it, work work it
Work it, work it, work work it
Work it, work it, work work it
Work it, work it, work work it
Work it, work it, work work it
Work it, work it, work work it
Work it, work it, work work it

Hot girl, hot girl
Hot girl, hot girl
Hot girl, hot girl
Hot girl, hot girl
Hot girl, hot girl

Pop it in the middle girl, twerk that butt

Pop it in the middle girl, twerk that butt

[Outro]
Does she wanna fuck an uptown soulja?
