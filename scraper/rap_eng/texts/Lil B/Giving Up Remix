Yeah

Keep it positive you know what I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
When you feel like giving up don't stop
Somebody want's you to blow up keep going
The world love you more than me keep it real
We all trying to find the key feel me
When you feel like giving up don't stop
Cause somebody want's you to blow up keep going
The world love you more than me keep it real
We all trying to find the key it's Lil B

[Verse 1]
I was dead broke but I stayed on my hustle
Selling bags and I'm selling off 30's
Selling handbags I might as well start working
Hating bitch said I won't even scratch the surface
50 Grand show and I was hitting the biggest lick on myself
And you know that it's working
Bitch sold 10 bands and it ain't even hurting
Motherfuckers die for a zip hustle purple
Black people wake up there's no more holding
No more violence
But nigga's don't feel me
I'm show my nigga's you don't gotta be realer
I'm show my nigga's you don't gotta be a killer
I'm a show my nigga's you don't gotta be a killer
I'm show my nigga's you ain't gotta be angry
100 Grand show and I'm not Illuminati
Never for the
That's on my momma
Real street nigga keep it real that's on my father
Never took a check
Never got fucked in my ass for a bitch
Know what I'm saying
And I used to hit licks back door all that shit
But now I'm positive, and I'm on that shit
It's Lil B

[Chorus]
