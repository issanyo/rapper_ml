[Intro]
Yeah like I said, so we almost getting-
We getting through Green Flame and we almost to the end but I wanted to make sure I speak some real sh- from the heart

[Verse]
I want to thank all the people that love me
'Cause without your life, my day wouldn't be so sunny
It's that Green Flame I still got hate in my heart
But it slowly goes away when I talk to ya'll
I feel a couple years - shit - I'mma talk to God
Please pray for my soul to keep walking on
Man, you see me i the flesh, you see me at best
I got to put the dope down I feel it up in my chest
This the gangster's poet diary, life inspires me
My mind on the money because people going to for sure lie to me
The real one: love them to the core
Think about it: do you really love me? Would you really go to war?
Win, lose, or draw, please pick your battles
The grim reaper got a bow, and he shooting out arrows
I pray every day that you healthy and you happy
And you suckers hate love and you want to clap at me
Why?

[Outro]
This just Green Flame, This just Green Flame
This is Green Flame
I'mma tell ya'll like ya'll going to remember me for life because I do this for ya'll man
Regardless if I'm here or gone, know I do this for ya'll
We takin the -
Put that dope down, quit selling them drugs
Quit hurting the - quite hurting the people that's closest to you, quit being blind
Anything could happen to me, I want to make sure I speak the real so y'all know the truth how i really feel, regardless
Ya'll collect this music, pay attention, check me out wodie
Motherfuckers losing they life every day, sometimes babies getting born and they die
You alive, you listening to this
Aye check me out man, we made it, Green Flame
Check me out wodie, we made it, a lot of people didn't
This that Green Flame, this Lil B yeah
