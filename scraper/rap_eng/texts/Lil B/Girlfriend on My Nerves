Stupid bitch ain’t seeing me

No respect for you mark niggers

Felt like a truck hit you truck hit you nigga tighten up
No respect so I rack up on you
Roll like I couldn't see you you front my cousin say
Thugs on them nigga don’t go
All that shit just a pain ask me what’s my name bitch
Couple people know my name bitch
