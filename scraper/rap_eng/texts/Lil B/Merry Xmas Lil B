[Intro]
Yeah Merry Christmas
M-M-Merry Christmas, bitch
Yeah (lord forgive me)

[Verse 1]
Merry Christmas, bitch
This the New Year
Golden collectible, rare edible
Mmm...based
Mmm...food, MF DOOM
Couldn't understand my Kool Keith stance
Southpaw so are you
Immortal Technique's my right hand, RZA
Raekwon, he couldn't, he couldn't steal my GZA
This is Christmas
Got a new vision
Lukewarm I'm spittin'
All the war I'm givin'
All my thoughts, my thoughts are Just Blaze
My heart 9th Wonder, J Dilla
DJ Premier, I pay homage to the illest
No matter how much hate you faggots send my way
Merry Christmas today
One love, Lil B

[Outro]
Merry Christmas, bitch
Merry fucking Christmas
This that rare golden collectible Christmas edition
Want to tell everybody Merry Christmas
God bless your family, happy New Year
If you downloaded this and you listenin' to this right here
I love you, that's from my heart
Not everybody gon' listen to this
And not everybody real enough to listen to this part
So I love you
I love you for having my back
Merry Christmas for real from Lil B
One love, yeah
Merry Christmas Lil B
Merry Christmas Lil B
