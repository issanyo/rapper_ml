[Verse 1]
That bitch say she loyal I told you
The hoe that cash out
Tiny shirt tiny jeans

I can’t pay my rent bitch I’m a cash out
Domestic violence case I punched a bitch
In her damn mouth
Yea I got some money but
Hoe will steal a drought
I’m that pretty bitch that is dropping bags in the house
In the strip club almost knocked a hoe out
I get so jealous bitch that you can’t go out
I gets jealous stay up in the house
Your best friends going out bitch you going to get knocked out
Still selling Jerry and I still take risk
Tiny shirts tiny jeans I’m going to fuck a bitch
