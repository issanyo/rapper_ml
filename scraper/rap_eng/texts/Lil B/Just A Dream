Dreams
Dreams are so powerful

I have many dreams
Some I want to turn to non-fiction
Recurring, legendary, what's on my mind
I had to gain the courage
My dreams fathered me
And I can see what really matters
My brain is a giant forest
Trees growing in little circuits
Got animals, we're in a circus

How do I understand what my motives will
Lead me to
When I dream I paint a picture
Crayola cerebellum
Paper on the surface
Eraser
Are the all-timers
Our class is life
Let's see if you remember the test
Understand, when you dream you are clutching success
It's the rap in the sleep
Before initial steps
My guests like zodiac
Final Fantasy
Is all a dream
We choose to bring the things
That are special to reality and make them fact
This is fact
This is dreams

Just a dream
Just a dream

I dream for it because I'm a young legend
Story unfold while I live
Dreams show me the opposite
Opposites attract
I fell in love with the pain
Scared to sleep but love to think
Didn't understand my mind at times
Still, I dream for the future
And the present
The gift in the past
The moment is a blessing

Dreams
All I can do is dream
Sometimes I sit by myself
And I just think
Dreams are infinity
They shall be here forever

Just settle into your sleep
How long does it take to
Sedate
I try to time before I lay
It doesn't work
I just have to be one with my heart
I become the beat
I had to lead the drums
The blood surges
My brain starts to shut down
Certain urges are held back
I feel relaxed
Happy to nap
Or to sleep for hours
And somehow waking up
Lucky
No complications with my body workers
Thank the spirit
I can dream
Thank you spirit

Just dream
These dreams that I have
Once in a lifetime

Apparently there's a way
You can track your sleep patterns
Would that interfere with life's grasses?
Seeing through the glasses of the modern human
I get worried about the instant
But when you sleep your mind is building fences
Microwave a dream, it will still come out warm
It makes my body transfer
I cannot tell what's real
I'm asking
Questions to myself with no answers
Just emotions, feelings, vibrations
Mental stimulation
Video-game arcade in my mind
Paintball in my brain
Streets are raging, alight
I can dream for simple things
But I'm dreaming for life
Dreaming for earth
Bottled up, no Sprite
I don't like to promote brands
I just promote life
Let me dream
Live my life

Just dream
