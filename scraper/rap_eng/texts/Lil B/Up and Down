[Intro: Lil B]
Niggas been through the struggle
Everything man
Still in that shit everyday
Ain't shit change man
Muh'fuckas still asking me for change everyday
You know this shit real man
What you gon' do?

[Verse 1: Lil B]
I put the Glock, mastermind like six shots
Learn music, guns snap your finger in six spots
I'm burning over temp, my flows is too hot
And watch out, make sure your ho in line
Because I don't want to end up using my nine
Bottom of the gun, knock your teeth, you cryin
Im like crop circles, nobody know I'm flyin
Put life on the mic, perfection in rhyming
You ain't got --
Fuck your grinding
Just sit back and wait
You gon' get your time
Seen good people die when they out on the grind
You think that it's funny cause you are living a lie
Alot of people dont last cause they ready to fly
At the liquor store stacking the matches
It's real hood magic
Everything is a fucking classic
Treat rap like a car
Why dont you gas it?
Got grades, but never been average
People look up, I never look up
You got shook up but I never shook up
You switched up and I never switch up
Lil B

[Verse 2: Lil B]
The dope game, small time, people is all dyin'
Living for a short time, use to be all fine
Teeth in the game and you came on the wrong side
I learned from the hood, stern hardly
You gon' die
Niggas dont lie
Work hard, you all dry
Come off a lick now im looking like Best Buy
What's the best buy?
Maybach for a test drive?
We the came color but i'm not like him guys
He talk shit, he is ready to die
Fuck with the wrong one, his soul is gon' fly
Stay out of mine
Im living my own life
Dont watch me, im watching you all night
His soul rise when he took that bullet
You a coward with a gun, anybody can pull it
The hood killing hoods
You look so foolish
You on TV
You niggas is clueless
Lil B
