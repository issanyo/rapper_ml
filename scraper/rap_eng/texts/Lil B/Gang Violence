[Verse 1: Based Homie]
Homie spit the venom like cobra
Physicist, call me Deepak Chopra
Linguist with a knack for the language of the boaster
He rhyme with the speed of a fucking roller coaster
I spit more fire than the church quire

Got a few scratches up on that gun
I straight spit like I ain't got no tongue
Bitch came asking me questions
"Where's my car?"
Bitch which one?!
No Lil B then it ain't no fun
Everything cool 'til I bought that blunt
If you talking weed bitch I got that gun
Pour me a cup, bitch let's get drunk

And I don't get robbed
Never say never
But I never been robbed
Try to jack me go get a day job
Like Mac Dre that's not my job
But that's my bitch, ooh shit
She told me things I wouldn't even say
Went on a date and I fucked her face
'You know I'm more famous than you, than you
And I can do everything that you can't do, or try to'
