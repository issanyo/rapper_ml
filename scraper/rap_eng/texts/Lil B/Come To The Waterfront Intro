[Intro]
It's your boy Lil B
Thugged Out, Pissed Off
You know what I'm sayin'? I know y'all've been waitin', man
We ain't gon' stop, just keep this shit rollin'
Only thing I, only
Nah we ain't gon' be done with it, know what I'm sayin'?
We comin' with it

[Verse]
Only thing I gotta do is stay real
Put hammers on nails and put money in the field
You talk a lot of shit but you're not real
You're so happy but you're not forreal
I'm so jealous, I hate money cause
I get realer
But check it...
Or maybe faker like niggas off pills
Come down to the West Coast, I'll show you what's real

[Interlude]
Yeah this Lil B
Come to the waterfront
Welcome to Thugged Out Pissed Off
Come out to the waterfront, come check us out
Like I said, man, we just killin' it
All we do is kill it
That's all we can do

[Hook]
I said come down to the waterfront
I said come down to the waterfront
Thugged out and pissed off
We thugged out and pissed off

[Outro]
So every day, all we can do is just grind up, work for it
Thugged out, pissed off, we mad as fuck but we keepin' it goin'
Every day man, it's your boy Lil B, keep it rockin', all day
Salute to BasedWorld, everybody that's been holdin' me down
Get ready for this mixtape
Come inside, we rockin'
BasedGod!
