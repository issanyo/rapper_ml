[Intro]
Know what it is bitch
Bitch Mob Respect Da Bitch

[Hook]
Where you from, throw it up (Westside nigga)
Where you from, throw it up (Eastside nigga)
Where you from, throw it up (Southside nigga)
Where you from, throw it up (Northside nigga)

[Verse 1]
Bitch mob nigga, yeah you gon' respect the bitch
And I rep 7th street and I fuck with 6th
Man my name's Lil B and I gives a fuck
Niggas think that I'm gay but I fuck their sluts
Nigga word around town, I don't come to the hood
Nigga I got ten felonies, bitch I am the hood
And I keep it so humble and I say what's good
Nigga keep pushing buttons, I'ma grip that wood
I'ma tell you like this bitch, I am Ben Franklin
Gave my mom 10 G's when the ship was sinking
And I slide my mom 50 and it wouldn't be hurtin'
I be stayin' ? all in churches
People praise BasedGod when they up in churches
And they say that I'm setting bad examples
When I rap, girls, money, and rappin'
Dudes got a bible, nigga ask what happened
They see me on tour, cause my family active
Make music all day so my niggas go stupid
I make music so the pretty boys got respect
I stay busting on my waves and I hold that tec
Bitch Mob!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I'ma tell you like this, I don't fuck around
I got things on my mind and I rocks it down
Man I'm straight serving tracks like I'm serving dope
Nigga it's young BasedGod man, the English pope
Nigga it's young BasedGod, I'm the nigga who did it
I done bought a new Benz and I bought new bitches
I done bought a new house and I just spanked my bitch
Yeah uh-huh, in the streets is missin'
Don't nobody say shit when I fuck them bitches
And it's pretty boy shit boy mind your business
It's that Bitch Mob tape, go cop it and burn it
I be coming off the dome like a nigga in surgery
Boy fuck around with me bitch, you know what's up
Fuck around with me bitch, man you know what's happenin'
Lil B man boy, and then a pro
Turn a hood nigga dream into a multi-million dollar company
And everybody respect the bitch
And it's young BasedGod man, fuck with BasedGod mane
Motherfuckin' world, girls love Lil B bitch, what's up

[Outro]
