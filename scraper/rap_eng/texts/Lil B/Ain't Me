[Intro]
All the ladies, where you at
It's your boy Lil B in the house
All fellas, turn up

[Hook]
Yeah dude got money but he ain't me
He got a nice car but he ain't me
A real nigga what he can't be
Yeah you got a man but he ain't me
Yeah dude got money but he ain't me
He got a nice car but he ain't me
A real nigga what he can't be
Yeah you got a man but he ain't me

[Verse 1]
I don't talk, you already know what's up
Look me in my eyes and she wanna fuck
I be rocking solo with the top down
Word around town is I'm hot now
You're a freak ma, so lowkey
I can't hide, you know it's me
Have you ever chilled with a superstar
Private jets, black cars
I can take you places that you wanna go
Yeah I'm from the hood but I'm different though
She be laughing dipping low
I be trying to get physical
Beat the pussy, I'm emotional
I'm a Leo
You get what you see girl
She wanna see me yo

[Verse 2]
Be honest, have you ever chose up
I'm playing my lane, I don't want none
But I feel like you owe me some
You give off the vibe you a hoe or something
Ain't nothing wrong, I respect that
Hey waiter, where the check at
Girl you did me wrong, can't respect at
You left the table, won't forget that, damn
I'ma tap in
This ain't just rapping
I'ma go to the top floor
Meet me in [?] when I'm on tour
And I know you a hot girl
But come into my world
You see what I see
Girl you should be on TV
