[Lil B]
Yeah man
This for all my niggas who done made it man you know what Im sayin
Yeah this a real celebration you feel me
All my young niggas stand up you namsayin
Worldwide man we made it out the struggle man
You nah'mean
Tell em get money bitch we on top bitch

[Verse 1]
All my young niggas that made it
All my young niggas that died
Swear to God I wanna cry but we just gotta shine
Everytime I open my eyes
I don't see a thang
We come from Kings and Queens
Not the white mans dream
I ain't tryna be no hater
Just sayin' whats real
We come from building pyramids to niggas poppin pills
Now tell me whats real
Imma tell you whats right
Its cool to be a Doctor - Its cool to be a Janitor
Support Black People cause we all done seen Hell
From the top of the world
To the bottom of the barrel
Shoutout to Egypt
Shoutout Ethiopia
Shoutouts to Kemet
Shoutsout to Africa
The black man was the first on this Earth
Prayin to myself you won't catch me up in church
Is it heaven or is it hell?
Is it up or is it down?
Thats a white lie we livin'
Hell, look around!
Booker T. Washington, still got that honor
Born into bondage, still became a scholar
His family slept in dirt, still adopted a kid
Don't matter what you wear
Don't matter where you live
Don't try to keep up, just stay in your lane
On my brothers grave
I will never change

[Hook]
Imma keep it real
Thats all that I know
You was born rich
I was born poor

[Verse 2]
You got your last name but your whole family tree
I can count on one hand
Feel like its only me
10 million blacks, half of em got killed
Wheres my distant family?
They in the Atlantic Ocean
Im the King from Egypt
Not the King from England
I won't perm my hair
You niggas must be dreamin'
Leave your hair nappy
Thats really classy
You worried bout the crackers bitch worry about your family!
Everyone ain't evil
And everyone ain't good
Keep elevatin', get your mind up out the hood
Fuck savin these hoes, If they want a rich nigga
Gold diggin' bitch gon' suck a dick nigga
There's not too many black people
Left where Im from
Keep havin' babies, fuck usin a condom!
And Imma be there, for all my kids
I need more black queens wearin afros
Real shit
One time!

[Lil B][Hook]
One time for my life
One time for everybody on this Earth
We all in this together man
Keep your head up
Quit lettin these people fuck ya
All imma say is this
We got one love man
Keep spreadin that love
Keep your mind right man
Don't feed into the TV and that bullshit
All this American dream shit.. you know thats all just a dream man we in reality right now man
Live your own dreams man, have your own dreams man
Make sure we all in this bitch together man
Lil B
Thugged Out Pissed Off!
