[Intro]
All we can do is be us, you feel me?
That's all we can do, you feel me?
You know what I'm saying, Thugged Out Pissed Off, you feel me?
I'm just a... I'm just a angry boss, you feel me?
I'm a mean boss, you feel me?
Might fire the workers, you feel me?
I might fire my whole staff, you feel me?
I might just fire the whole staff cause I had a bad day, you feel me?
Yeah

[Hook (x2)]
Flashing on bitches at work
Knocking bitches out at work
Used to be a slave, you gon' work
I need payback, I ain't working

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Imma tell the bitch go to work
Imma chain the bitch to the dirt (Oh that's fucked up)
Crackers really know about that body (Slavery!)
Game ain't free, you're paying for college (Fuck 'em)
Imma keep my bitches split up
11 million slaves in the cut (Where they at? Fuck 'em)
Everybody know that they black
Bow, bitch, twerk that ass for sack

Bitches out here fucking for the cash
Imma tell the bitch like this
Imma buy a slave or a bitch
55 bands on a bitch
Faggot ass bitch, I'm stackin chips
I ain't paying shit, you ain't sucking dick
Faggot ass bitch, I'm stackin chips
And I ain't paying shit, you ain't sucking dick
