[Verse 1 - Lil B]
Keep it real, I seen some things I had a wild past
Hittin' licks taking losses I was making petty cash
I want to be the top physician a neural surgeon
But niggas gotta put that work in and I ain't working
To keep it real I seen some niggas that made it hustlin'
I seen niggas come with millions and leave with nothin'
Mom heavy job for real I couldn't understand
Being on the workforce, don't nobody really care
You're just another pay check, you're just another maintenance
Had a lot of feelings inside but I ain't say shit
But keep it real rap the shit got me speaking up
Used to get beat up and now Im slappin niggas up
Everybody got a gun so don't impress me
These niggas did me wrong for real you won't forget me
Karma got a lot of niggas prayin' for they last breath
Tryna make 25 and tryna see 26
Tryna make 42, see what them 30's do
I only fuck with real niggas like them New Jersey dudes
Manhattan keep stackin Philadelphia to Texas
Understand my message you feel me?
You don't live paralysed keeps..
Trap nigga Im so traumatized
I said Im so traumatized this the world I love you
Lil B look in my eyes

[Lil B]

Keep doing what you doing
And fucking away
