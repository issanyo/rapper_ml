[Intro]
Woo! You know we in Berkely California right now
Riding on the freeway
Passing Emeryville, going through Oakland
Shouts out to Richmond, San Francisco

[Verse]
One day to live, cause you living in the moment
The past is the present, the gift is my performance
I'm working for the future, cause I live in a computer
I could tell you things that I've seen
A lot of guns in the streets, shattered dreams
Spacebar, backspace, trace your steps
I'm on the block like Jahvid Best
Smoke a lot of weed have to calm my stress
With the thought like no money came
My thoughts is changed, step back I not my chains
Sport pack like I"m out the game, I'm out of your lane
Think twice nigga, follow your brain
I've got riches and I act the same
Niggas is lame, I'm too real, you want new chains?
Had to open my eyes since I got that fame
Sit back in my partner's office
Nigga laughing, reminiscing, how I took them losses
Then I promise one day, if I took that loss
Take the whole city back, open up that coffin
No sir, I don't believe in Jesus
He was slaved to the world, the books and preachers
I feel weird cause I go against my own body
Keep it too real, I got a new deal
Niggas is fake, but their money and their coupe real
Actually, what's the root of how you feel
Found myself in church, paying respect
To the Lord, like everyone else
But the picture of the blond hair, blue eyes
Is something that I ain't feeling
I ain't saying that I can't
But I ain't gon' be another slave to the race
And I got friends around the world at 21
This is on my mind, practice forgiveness
With nobody talking when I made the wishes for real, business
Niggas fell down, hopped off those fences
Feel bad because I made mistakes
And still got raped by the system, still forgive 'em
Spend your childhood in the courtroom system
Fell down, nobody gonna pick 'em
No money, no lawyer gonna pick 'em
And just forgive 'em, leaving the play nigga
Leaving to die, leaving to ride
I'm surprised he alive, for real, you poor you die
And rich get killed cause of money they got
Man the sports get money while the doctors saving lives
9 to 5 can't even pay the bills
We need to manage the money for builders and plumbers, welders and purifiers
The paper, the lover, I might go to LA for the summer
Venice beach music, open up the thunder, eternal slumber
