[Intro - Lil B]
It's your boy LIL B man reporting from the streets. This my I Forgive You Mixtape. Just pray for me and look out for my health. I did this because no matter if anything happen to me you know why I'm out here in the block you know these hating niggas hating on me. Just know I did it for the world fuck these niggas man I'll live forever

[Hook - Lil B]
Now before I fall asleep tonight
I want to tell you it's alright
If we have our last dance tonight
I want to tell you it's alright

[Verse 1 - Lil B]
I done seen people drink less
Nothing's worth a body
But they feeling they have no options
Look deep in yourself
See yourself
Be happy with what you're born with
People dying just to own shit
People crying on some grown shit
Hate to go back home when
You got to deal with the stress of life
I'm a liberal conservative
Freedom of love before hate
Make the world shake and quake today
People outside, humans look great
Had to change the train of thought
Move with action I would talk to myself
I didn't have no passion
Until I found rap everything was flaccid
Draining through the faucet
Trips in August
Paid for my shows
Seeing what I'm costing
One life to live
Hope you're living regardless
Watch out for me

[Hook - Lil B]
I'm going to tell you it's alright
If we have our last dance tonight
I want to tell you it's alright

[Verse 2 - Lil B]
I done moved up
See myself being on top
I had to rush
Until I can't stop no more
This shit is hot
People see me in the streets
They show me love like Pac
Please send positive vibes
You will be surprised
If you send a silent prayer
It will go to the sky
Then it floats to your soul
Like a liar it lies
Stop bringing up them names
I don't fuck with them guys
Or them hoes that talk there
Talking shit out they mouth
I'm a Westside boy
Posted up down south
The money keep coming
But I don't run to it
Won't sell my soul
I just love rap music
And tiny pants gangster
AK with the laser
I'm only here once
Go collect my pages
And if I pass away
Remember me as a genius
Lil B for BasedGod
I can't believe it
This is life

[Hook - Lil B]
But I just want to tell you it's alright
If we have our last dance tonight
I want to tell you it's alright
Now before I fall asleep tonight
I just want to tell you it's alright

[Talking - Lil B]
(Get out the streets my young brother. My young hustlers stay out the streets. They dying everyday.)

[Hook - Lil B]
If we have our last dance tonight
I want to tell you it's alright

[Outro]
Look out for me
Why they hating on me when I'm trying to uplift it?
