[Chorus]
I met a lot of bitches
I fucked off Maxwell
See me, no talking
I don't do that Nextel

[Verse 1]
I got four or five bitches, my name be choosing
I play the game of to win, so I'm not losing
I still sip Cristal, I do that XO
Late night in Berkeley or out in west Oakland
Walnut Creek or Lafayette
I'm a stand up dude with a lot of respect
A beautiful bitch you can't deny that
Four seasons, two guns and an Oakland A's hat
I stay strapped, my big brother is too
I still go to functions, I stay in high schools
I rock with young hoes you could call me R. Kelly
Looking for a Tip Drill but I'm not Nelly
I feel like Messy Marv posted up on Eddy
Five deep, no sleep, and a pocket of Fetty
Shout out Uncle Tracy, I don't shop at Macy's
I'm just a young nigga with his gun off safety

[Chorus] (x2)

[Verse 2]
Welcome to my trap house, I sleep on air mattress
Don't be boosie bitch, fuck a nigga who don't pay taxes
I'm still on the run fuck bitches that's bar hopping
San Francisco late night with that long chopper
I still buy guns from the Mexican down the street
Beat up my bitches cause I'm jealous and insecure
You love who bitch? Don't say no more
Bitch I'm a Leo, I need all the attention
Still got girls that fuck from way back
Castro Valley hoes, Fresno all that
Sacramento niggas got love for the kid
Borrow guns and money, its nothing to them
Fawwaz my big brother, I got his back
I know Lil B, Based God all of that
I'm from the waterfront
The pretty bitch is back
Young nigga with fronts

[Chorus] (x2)
