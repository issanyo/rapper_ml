[Verse 1: Lil B]
Let me bring you back to summer school, I'm working hard
People grinding everyday, but they don't understand my job
Came from soil where the roots are underestimated
Roses grow from concrete but don't nobody care to save them
I chose my own path, the worlds so uncertain now
People you grew up with, the first ones to bring you down
I made this song for anybody that relates it now
Anybody with a dream or anybody with a smile
I guarantee if you help another person out
You start to see yourself in the eyes of a new born child
Words is bond, so my writing like jail time
No watch, just life, I don't see the time

[Hook: Lil B] x2
I am the Wind
I am the Earth
I am the Skies
I am the Souls
I am the Love
I am the Pain
I am the Dream
I am the Rain

[Verse 2: Lil B]
I sit and think by myself, Does the world hate me?
Not really, But the people is the one who's shady
I spit knowledge and the youth looks at me crazy
How we all equal, But we won't elect the lady
It all starts from the heart for the massive changes
Learn to love or to hate, help the ones who's racist
You would understand if one day we change of places
Life not a soap opera no change of faces
But remain humble, ask questions often
Anytime my next bedroom is a coffin
Live life cause we the only summer out in Boston
Live life cause ain't all about the money flossin'

[Hook: Lil B] x2

[Verse 3: Kreayshawn]
Pan in hand, my stars align
Step in the spaceship of my mind
Into a galaxy of trees, I leave reality behind
In my own world I'm the ruler, no measure how I do it
Words my energy, the fuel
At rocket speed my mind is movin'
Others I don't see 'em
Solo mission made from feelin'
Don't accept the cards, I deal 'em
Asteroid hits, when revealin'
So they smash like doves
Feels my heartbeat's rushing flood
I'm blessed from above, music my galactic love

[Hook: Lil B] x2
