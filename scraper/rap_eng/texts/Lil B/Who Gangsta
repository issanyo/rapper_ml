[Intro]
Yeah, still in the hood
I'm still driving cars
I'm still gonna hit
Yeah, a nigga still just dealing
Still in the hood
Man, fuck no feelings!
Feel me?
Like Wayne, it's No Ceilings
Man - Lil B, bitch!
Man, I'mma fuckin' drill 'em!
You feel me?
I ain't talkin' about killing
Lil B - man, bitch!
You gotta' feel 'em!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm trying to build a house today
Tell my niggas in the hood, we going out today
I'm still posted, one eye open
Back of the head, man
They hit 'em with the strap
I can't forget them suckers
Set-up in the hood and they shot my brother
Fuck! Niggas think this shit's a game
.45, what the hell?
It was calling my name
I said I would never complain
If I sell off the zip, I won't get on the plane
I gotta real story to tell
Made news before rap, cocaine sells
Damn, yeah - walking right past me
New Bentley coupe, now they gotta look at me
I'm still yelling, "Fuck yo' money!"
I'm riding in the hood, doing time for the homie
You feel me?

[Bridge]
Niggas ain't solid like this
Niggas ain't solid like this
Niggas ain't solid like this
Yeah, niggas ain't solid

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm gonna cop a brick today
Nigga, move that zip - we getting rich today
I'm still on the stove with the water
Put in the zone, it's gonna jump like Vince Carter
Niggas say, "Don't trust B"
I'mma buy 25, cop 30 with 3
I'm still yelling, "Fuck you suckers!"
All night in the hood with them choppers in public
You feel me?

[Outro]
I'mma tell you motherfuckers when I'm right
You know what I mean?
I'mma show you pussies who a gangsta!
I'mma show you niggas who a gangsta!
Stay in the park with the Trues like a ranger
