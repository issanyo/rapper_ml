[Intro]
Yesssss, I appreciate y'all for still fucking with me, you feel me
Yeah, celebration bitches you feel me
If you don't already know who it is by now it's ya boy Lil--
It's Lil, it's Lil B

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Never been a pillow whisperer
Young niggas moving straight up
Never been a grind nigga straight up
Young niggas looking like food
You getting ate up
I got a fork, give me a napkin
Hold ya plate up
Your buildings, ain't not strong enough to support
You need support in a second
A home wrecker, interior designer
Rob and Crime Mobbin'
That's the bay for ya
I knuck if you buck
Get ya head stuck in the cuts
Man you better go head and get some niggas abrupt
When I speak it, I hit 'em rough
This that real shit, man they can't get enough
Shouts out to Styles P
Man I feel like the ghost
Niggas off B block
Smoking pounds of dope
On the west-coast man good times is sheisty
I'm the rawest rapper out that's why the people don't like me
It's Lil Boss

[Hook]
That the angel in your arms, this morning, (Wooooo) is going to be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
That the angel in your arms, this morning, (Like I said this shit feels like a victory man) is going to be the devil in someone else's arms tonight (Shouts out to my dude Jay-Z)

[Verse 2: Lil B]
I'm on top of the topic
All green like the top of the tropics
See me with a smart logic
The things that I spit be jaw-dropping
Hold dope in my tongue, my music is crack
Going straight to your brain
How you like cocaine?
I don't fake rap, I don't like those things
I, picture plane looking at the top of the frame
I gotta paint it all for a privacy campaign
While I'm right in the race track
I fuck a girl that rides horses
I be betting money on her
She be winning races
I guess I got good at that
So what, actually, man I'm grateful as fuck
While they sitting upstate
Niggas gotta take me down
Before I'm sleeping in intake
You feel me
Man I keep it too real like them dudes on Myspace
That be holding up...taking pictures on Myspace
You a dummy

[Hook]
(That's real shit, Man I said I'm too real like them niggas on Myspace
That me holding up dope, taking pictures on Mysace, you a dummy)

[Verse 3: Lil B]
What would you do if you don't know better
Top level I'm performing on a higher peda...stal
Niggas thinking I'm crazy, losing
I'm insane Lil' Syphilis, heavy rapping, fact
Niggas look past that like I'm...click
I got my long coat with the two round clips
I'm still in the zoo nigga round 10
Catch me up all night at the bus round 6
Take a long trip back look in my backpack
Take a couple blunts out
Meditate to the spirit
I be looking through the wall, and I face I see it
Man yo face is the pavement I done walked on it
Niggas is lonely I got no control
But I move the block man
And I'm off the block
Cause I call these shots
If they disrespect the boss again
I'm a show these suckers what an offering is
You Bitch

[Hook]
(Yesssss, Woooo, Happy year 2012, you feel me, Gods Father Mixtape, Yessss, It's ya boy Lil B)
