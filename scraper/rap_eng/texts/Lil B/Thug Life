[Intro]
Pussy, I'mma tell you something, okay
Now, when I was a younging growing up, it wasn't too many suckers around
As the years went by, nevertheless, more suckers became... born
Now I'mma tell you this
I'd rather be with one real motherfucker than be with a thousand bitches, a thousand suckers

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I got something to tell ya
Riding 'round with dope and I'm looking like a mailman
Bitches on my dick, you can be a pretty bitch
Bitch, fuck your money, I'mma tell you 'bout the bitch
Man this pussy on me, I can pay the fee
Too many suckers out I stay low-key (swag swag)
Trapping with the mac, I'm a thug with the strap
Man these bitches on my dick cause I look like Obama
With that motherfucking chopper I'mma show you 'bout this
Dope on my wrists with a Paris Hilton chick
Chew beef like munchies, going dumb in the functions
Don't give a fuck, I stay fucking stunting
I stay seven hundred, I need a pill to swallow
I'm a hard pill to swallow, bitch I look like BasedGod
Bitch I still got the heater (I look great!), might catch a fever (You know it)
Bitches at my house and I'm smoking a Cohiba

[Hook]
Thug life, Thug life, Thug life, Thug life
Thug life, Thug life, Thug life, Thug life
Thug life, Thug life, Thug life, Thug life
Thug life, Thug life, Thug life, Thug life
Whodie I'm straight, Whodie I'm straight
Whodie I'm straight, Whodie I'm straight
Whodie I'm straight, Whodie I'm straight
Whodie I'm straight, Whodie I'm straight

[Verse 2]
You was at the party, I was at the party
Dope in the game, go looking at Atari
Hot girls told me that I'm Basedgod, gnarly!
Bitches on my dick cause I fuck 'em in their ass
Bitch pay me straight cash cause I look so good
It's that pretty boy music, fuck a bitch if you could
I'mma tell you what's good, whodie I be popping pills
Whodie, I done made a mill, whodie I keep it real
Whodie, I'm like a teacher, whodie on the main line
Bro how you doing? Nah lil' bro, I'm just fine (BasedGod!)
You can see the aces, you can see the spades
It's a dirty fucking game, all the goons know my name
I'm not the one, I'mma teach you with the mac (BasedGod!)
I'm not the bitch (Nope!), I'm not the fagget (Nope!)
This' direct English (Yup!), pay me when you see this (Yup!)
Sold out show a hundred grand for the feature (BasedGod!)
