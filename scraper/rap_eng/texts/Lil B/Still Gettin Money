[Verse]
Caught games over cigarette cases
Models and entrances all titty searching naked
We came in looking like black panthers
No hoodies on
Shirts sharp cuts from Freddie up on the block, he'll be leaving at 2
[?] is what we came for
[?] as long as he got dough
We ain't no beginners over here
We play to win like New York chess
You still play checkers, you funny
Monopoly money
[?] starts monopolies companies that we invest in
[?] come to us for information
Yeah the streets BasedWorld
Trust the brand like whole foods
Like Dominican woman come to spot
We playing salsa
Took lessons five thousand in Santa Barbra
Tax write off for me
Back when I feel a king
Counting money with the money machine
Scarface with dark skin, a little shorter
Wear tiny pants, small shirts
Got guns faker than George Bush, Clinton
Marijuana dispensary keep me high as I count this money
Welcome to my life BasedWorld
On the east [?]
Steak and barbecue, never pin apartments
Niggas is thugging out
Got love for the East side
BasedGod I'm out
Oceans Eleven
Counting this money still nigga

[Outro]
Evil Red Flame
Still counting this money
Shouts out to Raekwon nigga
