[Intro]
Yass
I just can't sleep at night
It's ya boy Lil Boss
Sometimes I just can't sleep, my nights are restless
Sometimes I made a mistake that I can't ride
But always know that you can have that override at any time
Sometimes I don't sleep, ever, holla

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I don't sleep
My mind is on creep
My mind is on E, never wanna think about E
All three, talkin' 'bout all three of 'em
Don't hate when you see me
Just hate when you see me
'Cause I'm sleep, keeping it so real
Underwater so deep, so sleek
Never tryna slip on the steep
But always so stupidness
Life, world movin' this
So movin' it, oh
Never sleep, but, goddamn man I gotta sleep so tired
Made ya cry, but goddamn man, y'all right
I don't understand how I'm movin' like a man
But I'm still a man, fall asleep like a man in my hand
I've been sleeping my home
I've been sleeping my own self, sleeping my own grind
Sleeping on myself but can't even grind
How I wanna sleeping on myself, boy, in the bedroom
The bedroom like the hellroom
Hellroom like the bedroom, call it red room
Red room like the dressing room
Gotta dress up, get dressed up

[Bridge]
I don't understand if y'all know
I don't know if y'all even know or if y'all even care to know
Sometimes I can't go to sleep
I'm so hungry sometimes I can't even go to sleep
It's so real

[Verse 2]
It's so real, thinking 'bout goin' to sleep on the deal
Don't play games on the deal
Don't play games at the real
Go to sleep man, you gotta feel without the pill
Don't sleep on the NyQuil
Nah, sleep off the night quilt boy
Can't sleep
Even off the NyQuil I still sleepwalk like goddamn I can't sleep
Man this shit's so deep
And the shit ain't all sweet like the sugar but it's so sweet
Lil' sugar for the girl
Still can't go to sleep
Momma told me go to sleep, can't go to sleep
And I'm writing all these raps, can't go to sleep
Man I'm listening to music, can't go to sleep
And I got my life dream, can't go to sleep
Man I'm feelin' like they sleeping on me
So how can I sleep with somebody else sleeping on me
Man I can't sleep if somebody else sleeping on me
Early bird get the warm in the morning

[Outro]
Lil boss Base freestyle for the 'plause
What type of rapper you know do it like this
Can't nobody do it like this
Spit on some freestyle shit like this
On this type of beat, holla at me boys
In the street, Lil B waterfront
On my waterfront
