[Intro]
Real talk, this that Evil Red Flame
I know you done downloaded that Red Flame
Y'all got that Blue Flame and shit
Niggas like me, I feel like I'm Reggie Miller
Came straight from the 3-point, my nigga I'm Miller
Came straight from that iso, niggas can't stop me
It's Lil B for Lil Boss bitch
Check me out

[Verse 1]
Westside gangstas, Eastside mobsters
Southside hustlers, Northside ballers
Trapping to the block and I'm working like a stripper
Swag to the tips so they call me Reggie Miller
Call me Reggie Miller, cell phone off the Richter
10 hoes calling, 20 hoes texting
Jump to the dirty, swag too early
Purchase everything and I might just buy some bitches
Young Based God got 10, going for 30
30 on my dick cause my bitch call me in early
Hoes love me cause I never come dirty
Bitch I'm off the scale and I dunk like James Worthy
Reggie Miller

[Hook]
Westside gangstas, Eastside mobsters
Southside hustlers, Northside ballers
Trapping to the block and I'm working like a stripper
Swag to the tips so they call me Reggie Miller

[Verse 2]
When I was traded for the team, niggas hated on that
I understand it, shoot my life away
Black and Yellow was the clothes that I wore
The games on my back standing from the 3-point
My teeth messed up as well, I'm paid as well
Light-skinned? Nah, a little dark on tv like Bob Barker
Love is lost sometimes nigga, ask Tony Parker
And I'm a righteous man
Live a private life, but on the court
Nigga, it's my game
Niggas underestimated the God
That's when the prophet is born, sleeping in the sky
You can never forget about me
A permanent scar, fly away because I'm closer to Mars
Even if it's a dream , I stay surrounded by stars
Lil Boss Reggie Miller

Evil Red Flame, my nigga
You know what the fuck it is
Realest niggas alive, you feel me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Championship, niggas training for weeks
Blood sweat and tears, my emotions ears
Roll with the Colts, still a leader
But I can listen, that makes me superior
Niggas think if you box me out
That I'll be farther from the post
Nigga take notes: supreme
What do I do? Trade cards and pitches
Based World like a gift from forbidden scriptures
Niggas don't wanna let me teach
Cause I fill the world with positive, I layup and curl
Iso forward with mercy
Slow motion is better than no emotion
Reggie Miller in the Fortress
Lil B for Lil Boss
Brang-dang, I'm pacing like a Pacer
My heart is racing - Reggie Miller to the death
I'm iller, Lil B, that nigga

Rep this to the block my nigga
This likely an army

[Hook x2]
