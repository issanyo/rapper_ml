Yeah...
I swear to God it gotta be time
Swear it gotta be time
Yeah
I said it gotta be time

Time is on my watch, but time stops
Time never tells, time lies
But, true lies are like a movie, I'm not a movie
This is not fake, time is fake
When you on the internet, time speeds up
So what's time?
Time to grind, time for mine
Time is timeless
Time is everything and it's kinda timey, but still huge
Everybody knows time is... amazing
Time is anything and everything, without time
We have no direction, without direction
We have no intersections to step in
Holla at me, boy
Time is everything, time is so correct with it
When it's battling for respect, time is...
Time over grinding, time is over anything, overriding
Anybody overriding, time is riots
Time is making progress over riot, trying over trying
Time is making everybody see that it's your time
Time is working for the grind, time is telling everybody time is forever
Time is everlasting, time is like the water, everlasting
Time is timeless, like Thomas Jefferson: amazing
Time is anything and everything

Yeah
Yeah

Man I see that the time is up
Time is always here, never give up
Time is, time is real
Time is showing us that everything is available if we work harder than ever
Time is showing us that people are writing and rioting, for everybody else, boy, in the riots
Time is so everlasting, boy don't try it
Time is so crazy
Time is so amazing
Time is so amazing
Time is so shady
Time is soul-gazing
Time is like stargazing in the lights, looking but still not understanding how we got there
Looking at my hand, ?, like oh my God, my right arm has the time
G-Shock time, wall clock time, clock-in work, clock-out time, work
Handle business time
Handle business time
Handle business time, I'm on the grind

Love y'all man, time above time
