[Intro]
Yeah, Red Flame Devil Music
Come on in

[Verse]
Feeling like Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker
Walking in the streets in the hood like Peter Parker
Focused
Boyz in the hood never notice
How the things different [?] players club
Wasn't watching Belly
Watching movies up in the telly
It was all what you [?]
Considering I'm driven like movies
That you [?] thinking
Terminator 2 glorified in the hood
Vehicle we passing up knowledge
It's with the great of good
Talk to your girl in the movies to play it like you should
Where you both get to fantasize like
Pocahontas that was based on the truth
Or rather watch Blade or Juice
Call me weird
I like Power Rangers the first movie over any movie, it's so groovy
I think Avatar made humble
[?] Titanic, the ocean can't die
Jumanji, Alien vs. Predator
Number two was the best
Totalled the car, lost my brain in a wildfire
I'ma get it back someway
I'm suicidal
And the truth is all dogs go to heaven
[?] playing on 711
Childhood dreams wanted to be the Lion Kind
Mufasa killed his brother
That's something I'll never do
It's honor over everything
VHS while I'm watching less as a teacher

[Outro]
Lil B, my life is like VHS
Red Flame Devil Music
Shouts out Kanye West
It's just a movie
