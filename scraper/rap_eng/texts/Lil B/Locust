[Intro]
Now you ever been over here?
Aye baby I can take you to San Francisco
And let me tell you. uhm
I'ma show you something
You ain't ever been to the the city before?
You ain't ever been to SF?
Ah yeah baby I got something to show you

[Verse 1]
When I carry big bullets
Niggas mad their Glock heavy
Im looking at your chest like a girl that's top heavy
With the scope every different bullet got different strokes
Send you real high, you was thinking you was sniffing coke
It ain't about money then people be acting funny
You want to rob the robber robbing hood
Came back for money
Rest easy now
The world is yours
Im not far from the people stuffing dope in the floor
Im not far from the niggas with the soap in the drawer
Win lose to draw and
Pray it up for the mall
Got to think all my ~
Selling packs at the mall
Quit stepping on us
Dice for Jamar
Niggas don't think
Leaving bodies a cold case
Running till the end
But you run at a slow pace
Niggas pass you everyday
You got to take this straight
I'mma gonna bring pounds over seas and other states
And my weight move faster
Light heavy with the weed
Got a belt from rapping
Niggas see me move quick
Got to bounce and clap em
See I move old fashion
Keep on laughing
Life too real to even mix it with rapping
I should of been the past and save the people my passion
Save the work with the money, bought a zip and im flashing
Who really run the game?
Just forgive me for asking
Some question no asked when they zipping my baggy
Cops pull you over
Is you gonna lie and stash?
Took that long trip
Big long out looking like a Mavrick
Ten years to a bitch
That big yard won't happen
Its alot of bum beef
Niggas lying , it's tragic
Why you hating on me?
You love me bastard
How I changed the rap game?
You can call me the master
Fast forward 20 years
Im still killing these rappers
Streets like to be trill hot with disasters
Sent me a care package
Catch a ride with get high
Getting high for thugs
Blowing weed to the sky
Boy acting like he care
I heard you laugh when he died
That shit hold
Fuck suckers and I ride
Put my pride to the side with my life on the line
You niggas think small
Putting stripes on the line
Think I give a fuck?
Im staying based till I die
And I ain't trying to be changed
Look down and confined
Im still unsigned
Getting money and grinding
But im still in the hood
Niggas see me im rhyming
Put you suckas want to see me fail
You dont know the real
The mac clip leave your ass so frail
And them other rappers shit they went to
I'ma keep it positive and keep stacking my mill
In my zone
Posting, you feel me?
I'm in the ocean
I am the ocean
Nigga I keep the focus
Lil B (yessss)
I ain't related to the locusts
