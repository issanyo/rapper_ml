Illusions Of Grandeur mixtape

[Verse 1: Lil B]
You can't break the best, best believe it
Niggas be like me I'mma regret this evening
Long hard nights, fate was calling
Seen demons on the street on my way trip New Orleans
Try to stay cool, I was just being cautious
Niggas gave me advice caught the ball and he lost it
Now how you think I'm gonna respect my peers when my people killing people over shoes n shit?
And I just lay back, I be blowing on dope
211 for a zip bitch, row that boat
Microwave the rock bitch, huh zip that coke
Spend your whole life in jail for that dope you sold
Serving niggas mommas
Boy you going to hell
I got conscience for the pain that I caused
I guess I just grew up
I guess I just evolved
I guess I'm just that raw
For real it's Lil Boss yeah

[Outro]
Yeah man, so you know a muh fucka like me man I'm uhh
Like that uhh, 89

Oh yeah, I'm in uhh denial, that's what it's called
Cuz Im a 90, I was born in the 90's fuck it
Ha, I mean the uhh..89, 89

But..my life was in the 90's
So it's like I be acting like I'm from the 80's but really, I'm in the 90's
