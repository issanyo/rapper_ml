[Chorus]
Young L
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
You wearin' coke whites but my Vans look cleaner
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
You wearin' coke whites but my Vans look cleaner

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Got my Vans on, finna out walk out the door
Put five on the grapes so you know I'm gon' blow
Got the new pack shoe, bought it right out the door
Holla at the dope girls, dope boys all go
Man, if you really tight, then you gotta get Vans
See me in the club, bitch I'm a grown man
If you see me at a party, then it must be crack
Cost 36 dollars, all black, yes
Like my niggas make slaps and we get clothes mayne
Fuck coke whites, 'cause my Vans fucking gold
Got new top-siders finna fly like kites
Go to sleep in the day, go to parties at night
Man, I'm from B-town and all my niggas get like
Man, we be sportin' Vans and we throw away Nikes
If you wanna get right, stop buyin' those Nikes
Get some new fuckin' Vans and you'll bet you look icy (hey)

[Chorus]
Young L
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
You wearin' coke whites but my Vans look cleaner
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
You wearin' coke whites but my Vans look cleaner

[Verse 2: Lil Uno]
I wear checkered Vans, the same color as snow (hey)
And Uno spit crack, the same color as coke (yes)
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
You wearin' coke whites, but my Vans are cleaner
They slip in and out real easy, like plugs
You can get different colors, like rainbows
Since 1966, Vans had set a trend
I got a blue pair, yea, in a size 10
Get your grown man on, when you wear top-siders
Button-ups and sweaters, equal attire
1, 2 step
Yeah, get your boogie on
Go slide real quick, like you got skates on
It's a punk rock shoe, so they get real dirty
Sole kinda thick, like a big booty chick
A big booty chick? Yeah, that's what I said
36 dollars and you're cashin' out for some vans (hey)

[Chorus]
Young L
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
You wearin' coke whites but my Vans look cleaner
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
You wearin coke whites but my Vans look cleaner

[Verse 3: Young L]
(Yeah, Young L, lets go)
Yea, I'm raw nigga, with my got damn vans on
Slip 'em off, slip 'em on, cuff in my pants
So they don't get torn in the back
It's a punk rock shoe, with the logo in the back
Got the red ones laced up in a size 10
Got the all black vans on with a skull head
I go (I go, I go)
Catch me in my Vans goin' dumb
At a function or a party, we gon' get this shit started
They got all kinda vans, like checkered different colors
If you lace 'em pass the fourth hole, you some type of sucker
Once copped me a pair from the skateboard shop
Went home, they didn't fit, then I had to re-cop
Give a fuck, yeah ya boy rock slip-ons
But I bet I'll snatch your chick with my got damn vans on
Holla at ya boy, but I can tell ya where I got these
Vans don't cost cheese, real niggas wear these vans (yeah)

[Chorus]
Young L
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
You wearin' coke whites but my Vans look cleaner
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers
You wearin' coke whites but my Vans look cleaner

[Verse 4: Stunnaman]
(Yea, yea, Stunna)
In my van shoes, but they look like sneakers
Yeah, they old school, like high-top Adidas
Now we gettin' money, all these niggas wanna be us
But I don't give a fuck 'cause my whole team see us
These niggas wouldn't bust a nut in a porno flick
Black on black, so they won't get dirty
Lookin' like a grown man, feelin' like I'm 'bout 30
Super official, short blow the whistle
Talk to my pistol if you got an issue
Smokin' purple stuff, got my eyes all hazy
Play dat Young Stunna, dope girls go crazy
My vans go stupid, schizomanie
Better cuff ya chick, slip-ons get ladies
You can have them coke whites wit them dirty ass laces
Nigga, Vans go, all you lame niggas face it
But my Vans lime green, yeah, I'm flyer than a spaceship
