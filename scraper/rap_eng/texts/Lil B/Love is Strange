You look so beautiful tonight, welcome, to basedworld
Thank you BasedGod, for everything you've done for me
Women are so beautiful, life is so beautiful
Pretty boy millionaires

Your body look so nice tonight
I feel my life is changing slight-
-ly; the way it needs to be, to be with the woman
Understanding me frankly my time has been tied up
With prior engagements
Thats promoting me to live
In the free state of mind
Even feel i fell back on my taxes
Show how much of a real rebel i am
Nothin' to brag, kinda foolish
Showin' you my manhood is far from stupid
Maybe my business needs some schoolin'
But in love I got a bachelors
Bachelors pad, bachelor party
Somethin' you remember
Nothin less than the factor
A part is sad so I'm an actor
Play so many different roles in life
I seem to capture when I take a picture
Your beauty worth a thousand Picassos
And I hope my compliments tops those
My eyes are closed, but my heart is open
Wishin' for the day to be swept away
I be the knight in shining armor her loves OK
I see the stage play right with shakespeare
I show her how my heart make the earthquake clear

Long nights, I try to find
Someone I seem to like
Thats my life
Everyone say I'm good
But I'm not
I try to find love in
The strangest spots

So crazy, my life
All the days I've been searchin' for this one woman

Damn my cinderblock heart stops
When you light your spirit
Kryptonite to my life
Often fight myself
My emotions take over
Why can't I love how I'm suppose to
Scared of getting hurt by the woman
Couldn't take a loving
