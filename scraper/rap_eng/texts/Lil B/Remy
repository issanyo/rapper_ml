Nigga sittin back countin'
That's all I do, just be sittin back countin these days and shit, this shit be so wild man
Like I said, God's Father mixtape man, this shit just feel good, this feel like a real growth to the 100% you know?

[Verse 1 - Lil B]
It's why niggas askin' me, I go hard for the people
Thank god I was blessed to talk through this pencil
And the paper is the piece that listen
Niggas ain't gettin it, the pieces of the pizzle
Complete, no need to finish
I be on the spiritual talk, God through my writtens
Nobody need to know, it's motherfuck a witness
My diary, I'm glad you niggas focused to listen
Stay with your real niggas, fake niggas make me anxious
Ancient, your hopeful shit revolve around money and arrangement
But listen to me, hopefully I'll rearrange it
Nigga you ain't even stainless, spots around your karma
Bad vibes around your people, wearin your mask and your armour
Cause you afraid to show your true self, man I post my new self
This new Lil B, the rebirth, can't be nobody else
But honestly a lot of niggas pray to be somebody else
You need to be an actor, get paid to be somebody else
You fake

God damn I be goin in (shit man)
You know, I just be killin it man, I don't know why, but I just do

[Verse 2 - Lil B]
R.I.P. 2Pac, I drink that Remy for ya
R.I.P. to my partner, he up in the sky
R.I.P. to my niggas locked down doing time
Had to leave the west coast, bitch the game is mine
You know?
Lil niggas complainin and I ain't even said nothing
Had to sing for the moment til I got serious
Meditate all day and I pray for bout two months
My mental state, I feel I'm young and I grew up
Had dreams of really movin up the interstate
Ready to blow up any day
I'm on like Oprah, waitin for that big check
They say I'm worldwide, I told em I ain't rich yet
It's Lil B

Whooooo!

I feel so close to the gold baby!
Basedworld man, I feel so close, I'm feelin like we doin it
The money ain't nothing
Basedworld we did it, let's go
God's Father mixtape

(Bring this shit back, the rap game is mine, nyehh)
