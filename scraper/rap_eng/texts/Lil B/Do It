[Hook][x4]

Do it like that, bitch
Do it like that
Do it like that
Do it like that

[Verse 1]

Girl so thick, let me hit it from the back
Shake it to the ground, do it like that
Girls in the house, make some noise, where you at?
This the summertime, bitch, do it like that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Freaky-ass girls, put your hand in the air
Freaky-ass girls, put your hand in the air
Freaky-ass girls, put your hand in the air
Freaky-ass girls, put your hand in the air

[Verse 3]
Need a big, bad bitch with a lot of back
Lil B, here my bitch back
Go in the club, I don't know how to act
Happy New Year's, bitch, we gonna throw stacks
Where them thick hoes with a lot of ass?
Oooh, she a nerd, bitch, I love that
Bollyworld Basegod, whattup, I need an Indian girl like wassup
Look at her face when she twerking
I ain't got no job, I ain't working
Fuck that


Hey girl, I got a proposition for you
You need to come work, girl
You need to come work for me
What?
I said, you should come work for me
OK
