[Verse 1]
Every day another person lose their life
How can I say that was wrong or right
I'm trying to be the best man that I can be
The hardest thing to do is raise a family
I wanna be there for all my friends
And then I start to blow up in the wind
I always make sure to put my best foot first
But sometimes I slip and fall up in the dirt
They got families that’s getting torn apart
It hurts my heart to all them people alone in the dark
I'm trying to break through this small room
The devil looking through the glass, I'm feeling doomed
I’m feeling all alone, can't nobody see?
Sometimes at night I don't go to sleep
What I gotta do is keep learning
And always remember that life is a journey

[Chorus 1]
Never give up
Life is a journey
Life is a journey
Know that we going
Real recognize real
Life is a journey
Life is a journey

[Verse 2]
Working on the yard just to pass time
I'm thinking about the world and how it's crying
There's people that's digging out the trashcans
And taking bottles out just to make some cash
There's kids walking down the street smiling
I hope everybody in this world stop dying
I’m praying for the people on the top floor
Cause when you on the bottom you can’t take no more
Sometimes I write a letter drinking Hennessey
Then throw the bottle out and put it in the sea
Walking with a friend on the beach
And then we put them towels down and go to sleep
I gotta make sure to stay alive
But sometimes I don't know if I will die
The telescope blurry
But remember that life is a journey

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, we made it
Life is a journey
Feel great to be here
Everybody, life is a journey
Always smile here
Ain’t no more pain here
Life is a journey
Best place to be
Be free
Life is a journey
