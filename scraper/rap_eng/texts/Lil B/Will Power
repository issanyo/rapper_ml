[Intro: Lil B]
This for all my niggas that we lost in the struggle man
All my people worldwide
This that will power
You know I got that in my soul for life
Yeah

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Now i'mma keep it real for my niggas in this bitch
Bruh i love you to the end the fake shit don't exist
I expect why you hustle, it's gutta to the end
And it really can't believe that i lost another friend
A lot of people don't know, they really don't care
What a brother got to do em, gon' smoke up in the air
Had to roll down the window, and catch another breath
Can't respect bullshit, can't respect sucka shit
Feel like a weight on my chest, can't do another rep
But i'mma rep, for my people that i miss
Don't understand why life so precious
If you really with this shit nobody gon' forget ya
People come and go, people lose they grasp
Trying to stay on the map like walking through the grass
Close to the --, I'm diggin' through the trash
One foot out the door, one foot in my past
My brother had a heart, my brother had a soul
It's things in the game that make people turn cold
I won't understand all this sneak shit, weak shit
Took court cases and you really didn't beat shit
Nobody knew why you left so early
But you, respect family i hurt them surely
Watch it from the top, move from the block
Little dude cooking rock the pain don't stop
Just watch over me, if you hear me
Touch a lot of souls and your swag live on
Niggas pretty boy thugs with tats on their arm
I still can't believe that my O.G gone
Even though we fell back we can always get on
The money that we made all the things that we pawned
This life that we live, you know we stay strong
You was a factor, your far from an actor
You wasn't rapping, cause you out trapping
Touch the mic, you always gassed it
You left earth it's tragic my friend
I'mma see you again
Will Power

[Outro: Lil B]
You know it's ya boy Lil B man
R.I.P all the thuggin' man
Everybody rockin', you know i'm talking bout
But you know we keep that shit rocking to the end man
It's ya boy Lil B Based Jam mixtape
We throw it in the air for this one
Smoking It
