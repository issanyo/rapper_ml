[Intro]
Shit's crazy. I just wanna be based
Shouts out to Drake and Trey Songz

[Verse 1]
Yeah, Drake, I fuckin' feel you
I've been grindin' in the hood since I can't remember
And what I thought I gave up with the bullshit
But lions don't stop, they hunt down what they s'posed to
See me in the jungle, my terrain with the Pro Tools
And I was in the hood while you was shopping at Whole Foods
I left a mark with old dudes, I really peep game
I understand what I'm supposed to
I really say "what's good" from the heart, I'm being honest
But people look at me like a dollar sign con man
That makes me think about the underlying drama
But this girl's really trippin', sayin' she my baby mama
I'm not the baby's father, but I still got a conscience
So I gotta be honest, I might be the baby's father
I gotta step up, but it's so hard to get tough
Here's a tip: I gotta be a man and grow nuts
God damn, being honest with yourself is so hard
Sometimes I'd rather be in jail, but
That's coppin' out because this game I call life
Ain't no ways out except life
Because even when you die, no tellin' when you go
So might as well live life and see the places you can go
I'm goin' for the gold and I'm aimin' for the sky
Completing life's missions, that's the way to get high

[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh
I just wanna be, I just wanna be - based
Oh, oh, oh, yes
I just wanna be, I just wanna be - based

[Verse 2]
Most of all, I'm livin' off energy
Funny when they help but they really be your enemies
I can say this cause I was fake once too
Interracial boss, my raps never ceased to
Amaze you, grace through, run with the pad like
God with the Bible, lead with the graphite
You can say you don't understand what I'm talkin'
Only legends do, because my mind is in the ocean
I'm stuck in the coffin, I can't hear your comments
I can't see you, and I'm just being honest
So if I ever said your name, shit, you better be honored
Until then I'm on a mission for a million dollars
Until then I make a million fans screamin' holla
Lil B for Lil Boss, want the money and the power
Grind never stops, so I'm workin' every hour
And I just want some sex, so the money like a shower

[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh
I just wanna be, I just wanna be - based (Just wanna be based)
Oh, oh, oh, yes (You know, that's all I want)
Oh, oh, oh
Lil B, I'm the rawest rapper alive
I'm signing out, but I'm never leaving
I just wanna be, I just wanna be - based
Oh, oh, oh
Based God. Berkeley. Bay Area
West Side. California
The whole world
Based for life
6 Kiss
I just wanna be, I just wanna be - based
