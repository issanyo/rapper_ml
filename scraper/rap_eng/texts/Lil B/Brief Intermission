Yeah, Step back I'm the Holy one
The only one, you feel me
I was out last night, make you does runs
Niggas out catching case with them deep thoughts
I was lookin at my wall with the tax on em
Little pray for my soul, pray for me please
Niggas wanna see me dead, 10 feet, material things
Make these niggas thirsty
No unity, too many niggas hurting
Put alot of schools and the scoops ain't working
You feel me, you feel me?
Donated bitch and I overstand it
Rap game old to stamp
Real life can't hold your hand
Turn my back on the fam, who survive in the sand
Don't come to the beach nigga
Unless you wanna fuckin swim
If you wanna chill out, go another route
I'm dope as the south, deep south
Niggas understand, I'm the problem
Spit dough, bag it up, then I go shoppin
Niggas post up, man, they know I got it
Bet you hide it, you feel me
And we gonn take it, and we gonn find it
It's that shotgun man it make you naked
Don't try em, I would sell dope half of it
But most people won't buy
Sold off a key of dope and built a school in peru
And they say I'm higher than you
I think I'm high as you
Fuck niggas man, I don't even respect 'em man
We designing you, you feel me?
PYT mixtape, it's a brief intermission, never hate
