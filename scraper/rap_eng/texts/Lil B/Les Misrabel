[INTRO]

[Verse 1:Lil B]
Welcome to my trap house
Sack out,Mack out
Back in
The gangsta shit that was missin'
I can't beleive
I'm back and forth with my mindstate
I failed before, lost it all
Yeah I felt that
I fell back
Niggas hate on me for that, wanna kill me
Because they're jealous
Seen my face on t.v and could'nt take it
What did I do to you?
I'm just trying to get my family out this hell
Ghetto trapped me with no cheese
Feel like I've died twice
Seen my partner laying in the casket to early
It hurt my heart
That shit was....
That shit was tragic
I'm sittin back
Lookin at the game from the top half
Coaching, showin' em' plays
Ice emotions
Leave me alone bitch
I ain't got no time to shake
Offered him a job and the bitch came late
Ancient Greece
I was a king fo' sho' bitch, know this
I'm off the top and I'm focused, know this

[Verse 2:Lil B]
I'm a die a legend
I did it, I'm so happy
I love ya, I'm not above ya
I'm lookin at ya
They used to give me scraps on the table
Puttin' straps on the table no label
No label was pushin' my label
I'm not able
Makin' moves because I got the strength
Lookin' at me for the answers
I'm lookin' at you for a chance to show my face
Through audio or visual
Im spiritual because I lost people
It's a miracle
We are here for a reason
Take your time to find out why
You were put on this earth
A fallen angel go and fly
The sunrise got me thinkin'
About the situation
I'm Jimi Hendrix
I'm Led Zeppelin
That's legend
Lil Boss I'm no body
Cop my shit
I'm fo' sho' hot
They bump me in the hood I fo' sho' knock
I hold ya down
I hold ya down
I'm the doja 'round
I got you
We made it now
We made it now
Single file
Single file
Because we made it now
We made it now
Because we made it now
Single file because we made it now
[Outro: Lil B]

Keep that shit intact

To the bottom half
