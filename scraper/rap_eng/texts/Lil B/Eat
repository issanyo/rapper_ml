[Intro: Lil B]
I need these girls to get real nasty
This that Pink Flame mixtape
It's your boy Lil B

[Hook: Lil B]
You know I eat pussy
Let's get one thing understood
Before I fuck your bitch
You gotta let me know what's good
You can fuck my bitch (X4)

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Call me Based God, you know I got bitches
25 girls wanted me to fuck 'em
I can't do that cuz I'm conceited
Bitch you know Based God he is a icon
Riding with the bitch and I'm based as fuck
Holla at my bro, ima tell you what's up
