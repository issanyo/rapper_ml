[Intro]
Sheesh...
Back at the ocean again, right?
Square one...
Waterfront, where it always starts

[Verse 1]
Pull up like Italian mobsters
Awkward, looked like I did things that I wouldn't honor
Take a minute out the day, take a second for karma
I'm alarmed by the critics saying I wasn't stronger
Fuck 'em
Only if they knew, Andre the strongest
Seen a block nigga rise the second he launched it—that was me
I consider me a blessin' from God
I took the pain when they seen I was a gift from the sky
Realest alive...

[Verse 2]
Nominations, they don't even ask me
Man I rap for the love and my life is a Grammy
Drake said he ain't cry when 2Pac died
I bet a dub he ain't say that shit if 'Pac was alive
I ain't hatin' on the nigga, I'm just speaking my mind
I made 900 songs and they easy to find
And I freestyled all of them, eat these rappers
You can check my background—I make classics
Nigga realest alive...

[Verse 3]
Thinkin' based then you thinkin' business
Rap niggas go to hell and I'll dig your ditches
Glock 9, line em up, give 'em motion sickness
Treat bitches like a blunt and I gut the Swishers
Despite how I look and I seem to dress
You can't deny the big fact—that I rap the best
Cause my shit is all fact, Beatin' half the rest
Man I came from the turf, that's half the stress
Realest alive...
