[Intro]
Basedprint Volume 2
Yeah man
Motherfuckers just keep their hearts in the air
This is that feel music
I just want you to feel this
This whole tape just feel through your soul, you feel me?

[Verse]
I'm replacing, basing facts on civilizations
Contemplating, wishing, I should go through with situations
Emancipation may be the key to my frustration
Education is something I hate, but my relations
Got me on the grind, and shit, my mind is pacing
Riding flows so definitely, my mind's spacing
Hate me, cause my thoughts is bloody like menstruation
I really support unification
But like a leech on, my speech energy taking
Next week I'm off to the hotel, 5 star accommodations
Get me keyed, I'm on the teleportations
Seen a lot of experimental shit through situations
My rhyme thrill, I'm sterile through meditation
Hey man, I start the heat like incubation
I can't lie, I been from location to 'cation
Been fucked the game man, it's civilizations
Man, touch the cheese, MC's, it's suffocation
These fakers stay pissing me off like urination
But my raking is like Bob Marley to the Jamaicans
Shoot niggas up like we was reloading with the Haitians
All evil, I guess I'm related to Satan
All these niggas scared like mice, I'm exterminating
Erasing these rhyme rappers, lying with dying patients
I'm taking no shorts like they quoting my replacement
Hey, I gotta expand my mind and rhyme something different
But if I listen positively, shit, this shit is mentioned
I could please both crowds, my vocals, some of my writtens
And I do rap, and I'm expanding my comprehension
Extending my knowledge like going to college at Princeton
Now they love Lil B, and they saying this, for instance
Man, you niggas hear my slurs, yeah, I'm hurting my track
But my soul trees, the dirt, man I'm on your back
Into hand with the work, like I'm working with sacks
And now I'm pulling up my guns for exercise, I'm squaring off
Niggas blocked like insecticides, plus
I threw slugs through your chest, bitch

[Outro]
I'm sleeping
I'ma leave you niggas asleep
Fuck 'em
Basedprint Volume 2
Lil B - Fuck Em
Like we said, fuck 'em (x6), yeah
Hey, worldwide, Basedworld, I wanna tell y'all I love y'all, man
You know, thank y'all for the, you know, support, and positivity throughout this whole, you know, throughout this whole time
Basedworld, we ain't never gonna stop the grind
Even if they don't believe
Niggas don't believe you can achieve
Basedworld, fuck 'em
We ain't even in it for the greed, man, we just in it for the love
You know, we coming up from the bottom to the top, you know Fuck 'em (x2)
