All the girls make your heels clink clink (x8)

[Verse 1]
Girl, can you do that dance for me?
Like The Wizard of Oz you make your heels clink clink
She look like a pro and a freak
And I brought her in the club but I met her on the street
She stay in the party getting active
Brangdangdang I make the girls get ratchet
I be out in LA and Los Vegas
Out in Florida, taking orders
Bringing all the girls all across the border
You know how I do, I stay charging
Riding four deep in the Lexus
Finna hit the party, up in Texas
Shout out to Watts and Compton
Long Beach, you know we stay rocking
Shout out to the Bay, Berkeley High
Oakland Tech, Skyline, and Richmond High

[Verse 2]
If you gang bang, throw your sets up
If you a nerd, throw your books up
If you a thug, throw your guns up
In the strip club, throw your one$ up
I really wanna pour her a drink
On the pole she make her ... clink clink
She really need a dose of B
Imma pay for the (pussy) and I keep the receipt
Ask around town she just a freak
Imma keep it real, she make her ... clink clink
And she love BasedGod
Took a trip to Virginia just to ...
They really clink clink out in New York

Yo girl, my name Lil B
