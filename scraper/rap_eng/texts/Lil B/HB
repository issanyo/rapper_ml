[Intro]
You know what I'm saying 05 Fuck Em'
Real niggas stand up man

Lil B man you know what I'm saying
Shout out to real hip-hop
You know what I'm saying

Said nigga get their head bust, niggas get their head bust
You feel me niggas get their head bust
You know what I'm saying

[Verse 1]
Niggas get their head bust for fucking with TT
Want to get a million, niggas don't want me
I wanna see pussy, the guns, the Tommys
Niggas is snitching, no that's not me
Witness no sir that's not me
He's gone hit em with the Tommy
You know what I'm saying
This is shit off the top feeling like Biggie
No disrespect, I seen a nigga with that cream and pop
You know what I'm saying, lames is hot
Niggas is, you need to cool down (?) man shout out
Shotgun bullets knock his face off his body
I pop pills nigga, I don't pop molly
I got guns, catch bodies
The only time you catch bodies is when you go outside
You bitch ass nigga
You no thug you just a snitch ass nigga
I want the game and I want it back now
And nah bitch I won't back down
I'm just being honest cook down regardless
Man I swear to god you never cooked coke with artists
You know what I'm saying you niggas don't get it
Got a hundred dollars but you niggas never get it
If you wanna sit down and and talk about lyrics
Why the fuck can you niggas not hear it
You feel me, cause I know you can't see it
Seeing is believing and I know you can't see me
Niggas out here but you know I'm not greedy
You know what I'm saying knock em down
You know what I'm saying just for thinking and I'm fucking her
Food or something niggas get his head bust
