[Intro]
Oh my God, oh my God
You already know, we out here doing our motherfucking thing
I know Lil B, I know the BasedGod
The BasedGod brought me bitches
Lil B has so much rare art, I don't know what to do
All I know is I'mma fuck bitches 'cause Lil B said

[Verse 1]
Yeah I'm so grown up, (Figaro!) yeah I'm so grown up (Figaro!)
Young BasedGod strapped up with the coma
I love that black bitch and I love that white hoe
Bitches (Figaro!), Range Rover
Lenox Mall flex and I feel like Soulja
Left pocket 10, right pocket 4
Young BasedGod pay for pussy and more
Call me Chief Keef 'cause I love killing hoes
I'm off top flexing in that baby range rover
Fuckin' bitches mouth and I skeet on the hoe
I cashed out the bitch cause you know I pay for pussy
I cash out for pussy like it came with a soda(Figaro!)

[Hook]
I think I'm BasedGod cause I flex 36
I think I'm BasedGod cause I got a bad bitch (Figaro!)
I think I'm BasedGod *blank* ora
I think I'm BasedGod cause I got that ora ora
I think I'm BasedGod cause I flex 36
I think I'm BasedGod cause I got bitches on my dick
*blank* (Figaro!) ora
I think I'm BasedGod cause I got that ora ora

[Verse 2]
With that ark like Noah, bitch I'll explâ€”who has bitches?
Young BasedGod got bitches like Oprah
You know I'm flexing up and I'm swagging with that ora
Swag to the 10th and you say "Ora Ora"
You know I'm bi-coastal, left wrist culture
Fuck 20 bitches and that might make us closer
Young BasedGod drive cars with the chauffeur
Happy birthday, I got that cake in that Cobra
Swagging 10 blocks, I can build up a home
Serving 10 blocks, I serve crack and pussy
Flexing handbags, you can call me Reggie Bush-y
Smoking on that black, I got line to the 50

[Hook]
I think I'm BasedGod cause I flex 36
I think I'm BasedGod cause I got a bad bitch
I think I'm BasedGod, ora
I think I'm BasedGod 'cause I got that ora ora
I think I'm BasedGod cause I flex 36
I think I'm BasedGod cause I got bitches on my dick
(Lil B makes raspberry noise) ora
I think I'm BasedGod cause I got that ora ora
