(Pre-Hook: Lil B)
Flex on bitches take money and I drug up
Punk bitch what, got me fucked up
Call me Peter Pan cause I blow dust
Call me Peter Pan cause I blow dust

(Verse 1: Lil B)
Catch me late night, tryna buy a slut
International, I'm tryna fuck some
East Oakland, I'm tryna buy a bitch
Riding down the strip, cash out then I buy a bitch
Playboy life, cashout, then smoke something, then buy a ho
Captain Hook move out the hood
Late night, soft butter, bitch what's good
CASH

(Chorus: Lil B)
You flexing payment, yeah I got payment
You buying bitches, 2 for 1, more for me HEY
Smoke my bitch, like a jay smoke weed
My birthday, buy a ho for me

(Verse 2: Lil B)

Keep it real I bought pussy in Miami before
In Dallas before, Atlanta, lanta
Foe hanna bannas, if you like a jammer
Shit, mind yo manners, I'm doing awesome
Eryday I buy a bitch I use a condom
Breaking hoes off, like what it cost
Wanna get a job, bitch fuck the boss
Long reach cause my money talk

Cashing hoes off cause I'm desperate
Buy a couple bitches, cause I ain't pimping

(Chorus)
