[Intro]
Task Force, I dunno if I'ma make it
I need your help
Task Force, take my pink bandanna
Wrap it around my head, and let me die
Let Lil B music live forever

[Verse]
Still hold that chop, still hold that mac
I'm down for the bad, I'm down for the murder
People tryna hurt me, people tryna play me
This Black Ops, I play on difficult
I'm a gangster, I'm a pretty bitch
I'm a thug, I'm a nun
You gon' fuck my bitch, BasedGod fucked my bitch
Roll with the 30 clip, I'm from the streets
I'm from 6th street, I rep Task Force
I rep Bitch Mob, I rep BasedWorld
I rep BasedGod, hit 'em with the 50 scope
Hit 'em with the 5, I rep Task Force
Task Force got bitches, protect Lil B
I'm strapped with the 9, and I look like a cowboy
Pills in my front pocket, I look like a doctor's patient
White chop banana clip, we fonk with the mac
Mask with the chop, dope in the seats
I'm off pills, and I got bitches
Tell me 'bout the mac, I'm feeling like a teacher
Nine for my students, Glock 9 for the test
Shotgun in my classroom, bitches in the bathroom
Pistol play for my enemy, you know I power up
I'm powered up like Akuma, I'm lookin' like Keke
I'm lookin' so shady, I'm totin' that 50
I'ma tell you 'bout me, I'ma tell you 'bout me
Young BasedGod with a fucking 63
I tote that mother mac, I'ma show you what it be
Catch me in the hood, and I'm with that 53
Task on me, bitches on me
Call me T-Mac, I'm holdin' that strap
Oprah Winfrey want me, I wanna see ya
BasedGod, I feel like I'm a coal miner in Chile
I feel like I'm a doctor in Africa, bombombom
Help me

[Interlude]
Soldier, I wanna tell you this
Bitch Mob, Task Force, before I leave
That was real brave of you to protect me
Let my pink bandanna stay on my head, until I rest
Task Force, Bitch Mob, is one of a kind
And it cannot be, recreated
Bitch Mob till I bleed, the Bitch Mob’s on me
And I'ma tell you one thing: Help me
Now Lil B, Bitch Mob, Task Force
Take the pink bandanna off my head
I’m ready to go with honor
I protected Lil B music all my life
Task Force, Bitch Mob, goodnight
Put the pink bandanna on my face
And let me go to sleep in peace

[Hook]
I still hold that mac, still hold that strap
Still hold that mac, still hold that strap
I said I still hold that mac, still hold that-
Still hold that mac
I said I still hold that mac, fonkin' with the B
Fonkin' with me
I still hold that mac, still hold that strap
