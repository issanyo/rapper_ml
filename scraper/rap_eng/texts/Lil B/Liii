[Intro]
Why is you always...
Man I know you snitchin', bruh
I swear, bruh, that's why I don't fuck with niggas at all, bruh
Cause you know why?
All you niggas is snitchin', man, all of 'em

[Verse 1]
Whippin' that block like one time
Tryin' to push crack on the front line
Niggas goin' stupid for the drum line
Everybody outside tryin' to whip crack tonight
I'mma whip the in the coke pot
Microwave anything, look how that dope rock
Grown man be actin' so degenerate
Tryin' to get a job, but he got two felonies
I ain't gotta tell you boy, whip the rock
Don't ask me shit, I don't fuck with
Fasho, niggas man, wanna come up
I'mma front them and the whole clique double up
Don't ask me if I got it, just know I got it
Don't text me on the phone and don't talk about it
I'm gonna whip that dope 'til I faint
14 bitches, robbin' banks

[Hook]
I'mma never snitch on a coke liii
45 for a key, two keys a week
People takin' chances and riskin' life
All this dope money, flippin' crack liii
45 for a key, two keys a week
People takin' chances for the life
All this dope money, flippin' coke liii

[Verse 2]
Baby momma drama, man fuck a ho
The bitch wanna have a kid just to get along?
Raised by a woman, felt like she shouldn't
Beat my bitch up, cause she thought I wouldn't
Now the bitch wanna talk about child support
Damn near slapped a bitch when I'm off of coke
You don't understand how that shit feel
5 grand a month, bitch what's?
The ho tryin' to extort me
Tryin' to support me? That's war to me
These bitches keep my dick out 'em
Take her to the house, take her to the crack house
Fuck these bitches, cause I know that they fake
I know she gon' go bad, I just wait
First issues, then I act on 'em
Fake bitches, I just smash on 'em

[Hook]
