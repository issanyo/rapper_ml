Hundred grand show cause i'm really Scarface
With that bitch on my dick, Based God you first place
And you know i hold the heat, call me Lebron James
Bitch i'm so Chevy nova, that cater like a faggot
I'm posted like a soldier, i'm down and i told ya
I'll never ever tell, if i do i'm Jehovah
A witness i witness i'm rolling with the quickness
I do my own shit bitch, i'm back on the hit list
The streets want me, so you know I gotta feed em'
It's that multi-tasking shit, i be working and i'm reading
They try to test me, that's when i cold cup em'
Feel me bitch? Like it's nothing
Put a bitch on cause you know i love strugglin'
Hundred grand show and you know i'm bout thuggin'
Still on my dick cause ya boy love strugglin'

[Bridge: Lil B]

Bitch shut up, ho what happened?
Ho it's Based God, ninety clip A-Rod

That gas unleaded
That bitch check my file off-top, i'm respected
And don't bring this here and I won't bring that there
I ain't with that fuck shit them boys on that other shit
I let some flakes slide cause you know i don't do that
I could've lost my life but ya, ya knew that
This ten star shit bitch you know i'm in the matrix
Shouts out to Sacramento Sh-- I ain't playin'
