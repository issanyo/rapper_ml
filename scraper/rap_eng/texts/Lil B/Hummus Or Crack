[Intro]
I do whatever I want, know what I'm saying? This that music for niggas that do whatever they fuck they want, know what i'm saying? They live their life. Lil B

[Verse 1]
I need connections, I need a liquor license
Lick your license, look your in your eyes if you think i'm lying
I'm slanging weed and saving pills, nigga i'm not firing
I'ma stand up, because i'm not lying
My niggas funk like that, we on the spot firing
Bullets in your back like buttcheeks
I'ma slap that bitch, know what I'm saying?
What up with the beef? I'm weighing the zip
Bagging up dope, waiting my shit to flip
No money in the pocket, dry-ass licks
Man, fuck that, cause I won't pay
And nigga fuck you and sucka, I'll take ya
Free bricks? Man I put it on the record
Front 55 bricks, and I'ma bury you in the desert, nigga

[Bridge]
Know what I'm saying?
I got them bricks for sale, got them bricks for sale
Got them bricks for sale, got them bricks for sale
Thugging ass niggas feel this man
05 Fuck Em man, pain, real shit, niggas do real things man
Background soundtrack to that thug shit

[Verse 2]
Yeah, knock you down with them high rollers
Cocaine investments, with the Coca-Cola
I'm so high, I can't go no lower
Fuck bitches in the ass, and then I sell dope
One brick, bought a house, and the con ain't over
Fat bitches on my dick cause I cook coca
You cook [?], I cook crack
You cook hummus, I cook crack
You hop out nigga, and then I bounce back
I said you cook hummus, and I cook crack
