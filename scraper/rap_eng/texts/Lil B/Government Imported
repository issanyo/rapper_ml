[Intro]
Yah I don't want that, nothing
Nothing man
I ain't got no fucking problems man
I ain't got no fucking problems
Actually I'm lying man I got a lot of problems
Deep shit from the pain in my heart man
These niggas don't
Hey ya'll ain't feeling me bruh, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
I hustle all day footwork to that guy
My back hurt, no new shirts, I'm mad fly
Real thuggin' bitch and the East  Coast love it
Throw shots at the top like they free throw buckets
Finna hit the dope man, staying in my budget
Riding down the e-way
With bag in clutch
A nigga told me like this it gets real disgusting
Gotta keep my eyes open ain't no one interested
If they aiming for the (?) send 'em back with nothing
People fall around
(?)
Summertime and my mom ain't eating
Took a trip over the bridge and my dad ain't eating
The world got me feeling like this shit ain't easy
The haters want that so I move so breezy
Told my bank "Bitch you gotta nacho cheese me"
Throw all that damn money, ain't shit funny
People hated all my life, take shit from me
What goes around come around
I'm laying here bloody
I'm a player sent from God with the black hand bloody
Still playing all the cash with no cocaine money
Plus the feds really know, jail cell hold me
Sitting at the top, bitch it gets so lonely
Most people turned snitch and most of them phony
That's why I gotta (?) when you calling me homie
Pull the cap up over my eyes, no one know me
People try to control me
Bet you call the red and blue
If your son ain't know me
You don't know me
Damn
I move it like a gun that came for me
I stay prayed up, nobody watch but Jacob
Separate 50 thousand and bought a watch from Jacob
Tell you haters to step your cake up
If you try to get this man step your weight up
I'm in the same spot do you want to fuck my name up
But
People hold things that take your brain up
The pistol in his mouth, I ha to clear my name up
Don't let the fame make you think I'm brainless
Gotta watch them bitches, they'll swoop ya
Leave your money on the curb, that's when they flock on you
Watching everybody, praying everyday
I'm high like Mary Jane
Lil B yeah
Shh I'm cocaine
I'm straight from the government
You know I'm coming straight from the
USA yeah
Lil B
