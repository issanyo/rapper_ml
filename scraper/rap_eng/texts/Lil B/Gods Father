[Hook]
Jesus Christ wants to be based
Jesus Christ walks from the dead

[Verse - Lil B]

This'll do you right, no verses of hatred
See a bitch sucker take him like Satan
Now rep BasedWorld no turn in saying
But he did converting all our secrets to law
He can't say shit put your mouth on the pause
Then return like Spock and have revenge like Jason
Im a lazy dude so ain't no running or chasing
Put a two Glocks out, now you running, you wasted
Picked up the newspaper where your face on the pages
It's a laugh.. your life was wasted
The people ask why the world so shady
You have no family only gunners and cliques
Thats when the Gold gun go click and they turn and..
I miss - you fell on your ass now detector hit
And I see you red eyes, you couldn't handle that shit
Remember when BasedGod, man he granted you a wish
Crazy niggas like this be the ones thats rich..

Gods father mixtape..something is real special with me that's all i'm saying
Lil B rawest rapper to ever do it rawest rapper alive one of the most monumental

[Verse 2 - Lil B]
And now you understand BasedWorld generation
Converting to our scriptures taking quotes from life
But really do it, big stack chips getting wasted
BasedWorld Lil B no way to maintain it
The aftermath is shady but Im not shady
Even Eminem know Lil B crazy
I wanna see how you.. situations
Duct tape your clique..
Ain't no way for escaping
Niggas play that I don't got the patience
With the rap game I keep those patients
If you hear Lil B...

[Hook]
[Talking]
I said it and I wrote it, just know Gods Fathers... hear the lyrics
One man one life
