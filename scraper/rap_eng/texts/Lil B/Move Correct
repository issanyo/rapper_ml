[Intro]
(Baby, please)
You know, this for all these, uh, females that be asking
All them dudes that be asking
Motherfuckers be just not even tripping
Motherfuckers be lying for the money
I swear to god. Let me tell you some stories, man

[Verse 1]
Yo, let me tell you 'bout this lying ho I know
And I think she a ho, cause she not scared to ask fo'
Money when she need it from different people
She learned the game, but she didn't know that the game evil
Selling sex for money, plus that
She lie for money. Buying drugs with the money
Just to fade out. Three different dudes
For the pay out. Lil girl, that's not the way out
You gonna get kidnapped putting money before self
Slow down, take a look at yourself
What "he says and she says"?
She keep asking me for the motherfucking dough
And I gave it to her. More respect for a ho
And panhandling with no shame. Wonder if she telling the truth
Or if she playing games. A lot of girls
Nowadays is lost souls
Only care about the look, life about a look
Only care about the cash, where your head at girl?
You gon' fall into a trap
You won't believe you're not asleep
Pray all the time, they preying on the weak
Weak for the money, weak for the drugs
Or the chance, to level up and peak
Slow down. Turn off your lights
Before you lose your life. People on the streets with diseases
Picking up girls, all ages
And I know this a harsh statement
Harsher statement when you get kidnapped or solicited for sex
Dude got a bloody dick
But he put a condom on that shit
She lucky she got away
Capital of america, I'm importing the pain
And recording the same
You feel me? Walking on the same street
Kids walk on, girls selling sex
The same streets that the kids walk on. Gotta
Send a better message. The police can't stop this
It's the people. Some willing
Some not. It's not a dream
I keep it realer
Just trying to flow out and say what's real
Just keep it real man, cause I'm not for the money
What's up man? I'm keeping it real
You a fucking crook
Without popping pills I respect you, so I got you
For real. This is to the world of life
For real man, in this cold world
You only got yourself
You only got yourself

[Outro]
You know, if you keeping it 100, then it's cool
But if you playing that game, you know what I'm saying
Don't be putting motherfuckers in it, and you on something
You know what I'm saying, like, can't play both sides like that
You feel me, that's how motherfuckers switch up
Be on that different shit, you know what I'm saying?
So, pay attention to what side you on
Move correct
