Got a big head, this motherfucker, cause I think a lot
Let me move all this money
Be kicking all that money around, ya feel me?

Now the liquor got me twisted, uh
.4-5, pop shot, yeah, lift you up
On a richert scale, nigga, never
Never been off basic
Earthquake all day
Pull the strap like Matrix
Now you looking all scared
Cause you live off ace
Move into a group home
Bum off placement
Riding better
I don't know who's shaming
Fuck a dollar, man, nigga
Man, give me your chain
Just for your necklace, bitch
I'll leave you brainless
Now the cops say
All dope dealers is anus

Black man
Live off pain
And you gotta dodge bullets
Ain't no PE training
Tell all my haters
You can kiss my anus

Plus I'm in a fuck class
Living life, man, you can't hold me down
I just want to spread love
Cause I make mistakes
I Can't lie to the people and look in your face
My heart too real cause my blood is pumpin'
Feeling kinda itchy, finna dump somethin'
Real talk, man I keep it lit bitch, I'm ready, it's nothin'
