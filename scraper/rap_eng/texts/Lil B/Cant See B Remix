[Intro]
It's that Illusions of Grandeur part II
It's your boy Lil B
Shouts out to ______, Sonic Sounds, what it do?
Yeah, uh
Talking 'bout we thugging
That's the topic of the discussion

[Verse]
Welcome to my life, come fuck wit a gangsta
People lookin' at your smile but they plotting with anger
If you feel a certain way, then say how you feeling
People keep their shit inside and smoke away they feelings
They ain't gotta see a thing but everybody got problems
I always liked the way I had a few people by me
Nigga charge it to the game and I was out here grimey
When I ride my girlfriend I was out here slimey
I was drinking Robert Tucks and then I mix it with Henny
Niggas bagging up the reedy, got line on the semi
Shout out to SC, Lil B street west open
My nigga hollywood man, you know I keep shit going
Man brothers, I started being the game
Like who gon' die next? It's looking bleak
I start speaking with niggas that was out on the street
I'm like fuck every nigga, and fuck every cracka
Man you gotta be real to even see what I'm after
And I ain't never been a hater, and I ain't never been racist
I'm like fuck everybody, cause all y'all shady
While there's people out here sleeping on the street
A lot of people go to war but go nowhere to eat
Did you go overseas for the money and love?
You got promoted on your job and forgot who you was
A lot of people on earth is scandalous thugs
People run for president but don't really love me
I could see it in your eyes, I'm just a number with money
You could put me in jail because you'd keep the cash flowing
I ain't stupid to the game before a pimper was hoeing
Can't nobody hold you down, go look at yourself
You do crime everyday, that's why your ass in jail
You gotta move slow, everything don't come overnight
I've seen fights turn to gunfights, losing lives
Cause they thinking life slays when they thinking they right
I ain't never voted right, I vote left at night
Niggas stay up in the hood because they love that pain
You got a brain and two feet, don't be no lame
Sleeping caskets, the niggas is already dead
But I'm more alive than ever, it's all in your head
Everytime I speak out, everybody gon' feel it
I can't deny the fact man, that I'm really the realest
Shout out 05 and shout out to Hawaii
I'm still crying inside me because I'm so lonely
You can know him 10 years but that's not your homie
You could look me in my eyes, I'm out here homie
You could stay stealin' swag but you can't be me
It's an eye exam, you can't see B
