[Hook]
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grindin
When you hit that white bag
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grindin
When you hit that white bag
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grindin
When you smoke that dope bag, yeah
When you hit that white bag

[Verse 1]
Now bitch you can hit the dope, playin' with the long scope
Better not touch the bag, I want all of that
Keep zippin' up the lock, serving shit up the block
Ain't nothing wrong with smoking up when you fill the cup
Take it in front of me, I was selling to a rent-a-cop
He wanna get a rock, told em go kick rocks
Came back with the pop, same bed, jaze cop
White on the seal, like the color of a Maybach
I got a little accent, holding rocks in the matrix
44 sitting by the dough like it's magic
Serving mad white, all across the atlas
I smoke what I sell, I got a special package
Drug dealer try to sell me a dirty package
Block line hit em up, and dirty plastic
I don't play the hard way, you feel me?
Smokin zips all day, you feel me?
And how did he go, hit em with the scope
Stuff em in the trunk, the same place I put the dope
4-4 run like the summer on the boat
Never trust the person that keep snorting dope
Lil B

[Hook]
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grindin
When you hit that white bag
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grindin
When you hit that white bag
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grindin

[Verse 2]
You keep stealing my shit, I thought you wouldn't do that
You in my house, and you already knew that
Took dope out the fridge and see you stealing my clothes
Your even stole all the cords from the damn phones
You at the flee market, right in the market
You a scam artist, drugs make you a target
Now you a target, who seeing the farthest
You hit on the drugs that you sellin
Hurting everyone around you that you cherish
Money made you sour, the fame made you jealous
Better step back
Keep this real man, the brown back, bitch, you got you twerking
Never seen a young nigga out here geekin
Hittin licks, he never sleepin
Bad drugs he passed every weekend
That's why you dead sleepin
Lil B

[Outro]
You feel me?
Keep it real
I'm a keep it 100
Niggas know I'm not perfect, I try to help
The game over all: it needs help, help, help
And they know I'm not perfect
I'm a keep it 100, I'm working, twerking
Just don't sip that dough bag and don't sell drugs man
Do you feel me?
Killin' the communities man
I'm a keep it 100
Sometimes it ain't all about the money man
I don't put money over everything
It ain't money over bitches with me
It ain't money over everything with me
I can't say that
I can't say that man I put people, I put life before that
So I'mma keep it 100
If you based
If you really love Lil B
It's people over money
I need real based family around me
People over money, remember that
I only want real motherfuckers around me
I don't need that fake shit
I don't want that fake shit
People over money
You keep bitching about the money
People over money
