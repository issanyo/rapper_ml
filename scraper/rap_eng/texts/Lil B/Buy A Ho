[Verse 1: Lil B]
I'ma fuck the ho, bitch lets go
Skirt down the street, down E-14
Bitch sellin ass, ho let's go
Skeet skeet skeet beep beep there ho
Sliding on the strip with a platinum wig
In the strip club, I'ma watch the bitch's gig
It's thizz or die you Beezy
Shout out to the bay, my name Lil Beezay

[Hook: Lil B]
I'ma buy a ho tonight (x4)
I'ma buy a bitch tonight (x3)
My girlfriend ain't acting right

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Police on my back, trying to lock me up
A ho with a ho I be going so dumb
Keep it 100, I'ma feed the bitch crumbs
Lick the bitch!
Lick her like a blunt
Finna hit the street, then I'ma go stunt
Down in the east, fuckin with whatever
Cutty what it do
I'm trying to buy a bitch, how about you?

[Hook: Lil B]
I'ma buy a ho tonight (x4)
I'ma buy a bitch tonight (x3)
My girlfriend ain't acting right

[Verse 3: Lil B]

[Hook: Lil B]
I'ma buy a ho tonight (x4)
I'ma buy a bitch tonight (x3)
My girlfriend ain't acting right
