A legend said
'Keep it real nigga, stray away from a pussy, cause he get fucked in his ass like a pussy'

[Verse : Lil B]
I smash daughters, act flawless
Man I ball with high honor get your back off it
Man I'm from the murder cap coffin
Where you sleep in often
So its a lot of cats walkin round but we dog 'em
And I ain't mad if they talkin though
I learned a long time ago you can't stop the hoes
So, I block out, I see no stress
And when you mad I be going on casino trips
And my bitches so bad It make the PO piss
A nigga mad cause I violated fuck that test
Dude asked why Im hear shit 'change I guess'
Like guess Im name brandin' off the shelves with the clip hanging
Like Sylvester Stallone, with the cliff hanging
Dude left his brains on the ground and he just paged him
Said he got a couple minutes changed the situation
And he give em heavy based was his dedication
Dude, I ain't a sightseer but a reader
Tuck the piece up under the fleece next to buttcheeks
He got a gat in his ass now he talkin bout his dick bitch
Im talkin bout that dirty harry, douche douche little shit
The reason why we at the funeral with the head down
Let me address a few things that's been irking me
I think realistic and my heads not in ?? me
And motherfuck the police who said Im a rapper
Bet this shit pop off so you call the cops faster
With the ho took all the cash and I ain't ask em
Im coming like Im running 100 miles to a thousand
Been training for this day as I enter the ring of faith
Don't nobody see that the vision with me
Hold a place in my soul, hall of fame of the game
Random thoughts like a safeway I'll always have the frame to see through
Like a building on the land
No outlines, contractors, home innovators
I'll use paper and I'll renovate ya
Change yo status, nigga Im moving with the passion
Im like the movie Magic, passion of christ
Bought to life one time in the studio fashion
Lil B for Lil Bars while you movin' Im passing
Like a double dribble with no passes
How I get backstage and I ain't have no passes
Cause I'm young basedlord
Shit, BasedGod Hilton
Palm Springs Hard Rock or I'm in the Hilton
Never found guilty chasing the rain for the feeling

Lil B

[Lil B]
Like they said, keeps us real nigga stray away from a pussy cause a pussy get fucked in his ass like a pussy
(Shoutsout to all..) I don't see y'all at all
Chasing The Rain
