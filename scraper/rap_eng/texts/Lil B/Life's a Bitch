[Hook]
The womans born like BC or AD
Down to source of cells living inside a body
Just whispered from death like a comet
Many plants, many different people
Check me out

[Intro]
Lifes a bitch and then you die
Happy based day
Across America August 17th
Its a beautiful day, I did this for yall

[Verse:1]
Lifes a bitch let me explain why I say this
The tits is like apartheid, spread apart
Get my jokes, she don't understand in the dark
Come to the light, Ill show you something
Lil B

[Hook]

Cause Life's a bitch
Uh uh hands up life's a bitch
Yea life's a bitch

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Womans attitudes is like earthquakes, you can't stop it
Its a big war coming soon, be ready for a period
Oils leaks in the ocean, can't compare still more serious
Kind of scared but still curious
Sex is rain, you need to get wet
Wore a raincoat to keep you safe
And not get dressed in the cold
Aids and pneumonia
The woman's eyebrows are like the summer
Passion in the eyes from the tundra
Dont get lost in the love her heart's like three winters in Alaska
Her life's like childhood mist, lifes a bitch
We still love her like you raised her from a pup like a pit
And I just switch it to the next calenders represent
A new day, a new man, I feel bad most girls got a bad rap
Still got a bad rep like a present
That wasn't opened on the day of blessings
My gift to you is realizing the Earth
We need time, a woman needs some nature too
To realize the boundary, quick sand like jail house
Life's a bitch in this jungle
All the snakes resemble
Another person in the place of another face
Im thinking damn, how does a mother take
All of the pain like a comet, volcano eruption
Clear the path, a babies due
A new plant is here, life cycle, milky way understand
My brain is racing
Understand I feel like I'm jesus
Coming from the point of a human man thinking highly of himself
Due to an output of high art, coming straight from the heart
Understand the emotion, you can get it from
Listen, understand the emotion, you can get it from the fall
Unmixed cause im really this raw, lo-fi this is quicker to solve

Lifes a draw, its like the woman's skin
Either tough or soft, beneath the surface
Its more to models, she understand more
Uses her body as a standstill similar to waterfalls
We use, beautiful comes back and she looks fresh
Water could be poison, still you don't drink it
How would you find out if the water
How do you find out what to eat
Life's so cold ain't nothing sweet
Impression in her knees
Connected to the knees of the other parts you think
Let it brainstorm, put together you'll have your own meaning
Time represents lost pictures
Flys out the door witchya
Too like your girlfriend witchya, a verbal assaults
Feel like the worlds ending
If the worlds reverse around her
And she witnessed it, the powers on her
Sitting, waiting for the time to explode
When you least expect the pain a woman's ready

[Outro]
