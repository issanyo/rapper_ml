(Intro:)

Double X L, Freshman 2010 Lil B

Verse 1:

Rewind Time, bring back the student body
Niggas come at me I'm throwing shots like a Hot Toddy
People talk a lot, but they don't really understand me
I'm really from the hood, and I really love my family

I been stopped robbing, running through the houses
Addicted to the pain, so I smoked a few ounces
Knowing, I'mma die, and I really can't pronounce it
And I dont care bitch, I'm higher than the mountains

You haters love to hear that, you love to see me slippin'
The 45 make your head bleed, like you pissin
Word around town, I started ballin' like the pistons
Some niggas from the block, now they ballin' and they missin'

And I ain't finna, be the nigga playin with the snitches
I'd rather get stitches, you missed the whole blessing
My core foundation is solid like my message
I'm like 7th Heaven, Rapper, Ex-Robber, Ex-Thief

With the heart of the Unabomber
Wanna come at me, any rapper bitch
I want the drama, and I'm ugly and I still pull your bitches though
My right hand, make your girlfriend think about the dough

My white girl fuck me good, interracial dating
My black girl, suck my dick, and she on probation
And 9 times out of 10, I'm out ice skating
Jewellery, look like a walking lightsaber

(Hook)

Lil B Man! (x6) Fresh for two thousand ten

(Repeat)

Verse 2:

I really do it for the people, shit I don't need awards
I only need one fan, that listens to every song
And everybody think I care about selling records
I'mma die anyway, I'm a living legend

I can see through the fog, and shit
No I'm not forgetting, anybody help me when I'm down
Man, your time is given, and I'm patient like going with your father fishing
