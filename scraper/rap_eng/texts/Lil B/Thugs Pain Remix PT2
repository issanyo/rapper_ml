[Verse 1]
I take you suckers down for that run around
You were saying you was hot but I gunned you down
Last resort, I take you to that hoop court
I know people that sell guns and do extortion
What they do or who you think important?
They was just a dream
Last week you were just talking
Now you just walking
You was doing awesome
I came into his day now I’m important
Now I’m gorgeous (now talk about me)
I’m the one who is talking
The chopper rang and now he's saying sorry

[Verse 2]
I banged, bitch, them suckers loose
I strip you for your watch and your fucking shoes
They put me in the same game and the fucking bruises
I came from the bottom, bitch, where nothing's moving
If you gotta go and try, nigga, you gotta move it
I come in here with them tools, bitch, like home improvement
And I change your life
I ride on them bikes, nigga, at the same night
Bitch (Based Freestyle)
Forgive me (Based Freestyle yeah)

[Verse 3]
Yeah yeah yeah I rise so hard
I gotta fucking wonder
If niggas keep faking I'ma go under
I'ma pass on the bodies but I love numbers
I still hit licks, bitch, the plug coming
Yeah, how you like that, bitch
You know what I'm saying, we bombing on the plug
You know what I'm saying
But them suckers don’t get it confused with me
You feel me you know I still got the uzi
I got cameras like a fucking movie
And I’m here I ain't never watched Scarface

I'm that dude man this ain’t no fantasy
I’m that dude that came from that small place
I body any body that’s on the plate
I was doing small numbers I’m going to fail
Before rap, bitch, my life's so real
I’ve seen pain and I’ve seen thrills
The only person I ain’t met is for real
The gun gon' to make you happy
See you straight to that fuckin' heaven with your daddy
This is all a cold game, man, a cold summer
