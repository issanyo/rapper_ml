Came up serving up entrees
And like a composer play the keys and use all emotion
Walking in the hotel, smooth Versace on like I'm sitting vicious with my hat tilt back
No glasses cause my eyes is red, I want to show them the hell
Back again, put some money in my pocket it smells
All the fresh dollars bills, with a model that
Only wears heels, sit at the top
Tables for breakfast, she looks at me
Plate serves me
You a waiter?
New ways Bonnie and Clyde'em
So glad she see my vision
Niggas like me I just play my position
Outstanding with a tip of honor
Men like me work harder and harder
Cause everyday the dreams is fire
Get up from the table
Leave tip, so big that the FBI bought me cable
Dudes is like you riding Lexus
Riding the yard back state Nintendo Tetris
No easy access, security treat me like Obama
All my cars resting the chopper
Think about the future, passing forward
Thank the God everyday, how I get so closer
Feel like I'm dreaming, this is remarkable
States and condos multiple investments charity pronto
Rolling up blunts like Snoop Dogg
Try to put me in a box, still I move so fast
Couldn't catch me like tail smoke
Part of biker clubs, ride to the...
Meet Up for death of a legend
Shout out to Mike, God bless
Gone see you in heaven, let me see the money
Gone ride, respect ya at 25
Let me just save the mom, gift, moon and everything
Heart is real like the sun
Everything and beyond, spread the energy
Morning time lovely, night time hate me
I guess it's just one life to live crazy
Real excited but the new growth motivation
I'm off to college like a midterm
Sit back, think aggressive, so copy no suggestions
So cocky don't bless 'em
So cocky I don't need the blessings
Praise 'em
God bless
