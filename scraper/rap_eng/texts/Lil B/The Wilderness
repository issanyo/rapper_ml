[Verse 1]
Don't worry about the mishaps, chin straps, headlock
We all got the same rise, we all got the same drop
2011: we all in the same pot
Make a choice, you have a voice
Back then, we was parted by the masters
Gave us religion so we couldn't move past it
In reality it's all about the Earth
People turn their back because of money and its worth
Now I will never work just to work
People dying every day just to buy a t-shirt
And why college is so expensive?
People wanna learn, but there's always some fences
I tell you like that, I move with forgiveness
People always wanna cut but not with precision
I guess that we're gifted
This is one life to live and I'mma live it
Fuck the critics, I'm happy: Lil Boss

[Break]
I'm from Waterfront, Bay Area
California man

[Verse 2]
Lil Boss: party, no party, people still rocking
Young Based God, no way to stop me
Stop with the hate, the cowards watching
Signed a couple checks, I ain't talking deposits
This change for, this is wannabe gangstas
People that get lost, no walks with the strangers
Had no friends, I was looking for an angel
Wanted the floor map but I ain't have no angles
Now every time I see the flag, I salute to the thugs
The flag salutes back, that's America for us
People die just to speak to the freedom before us
Now we pleading for more stuff, we can watch over
There's clones in the hood, everybody is a soulja
And everybody with this shit
But don't nobody wanna teach nobody
Wanna get sick, but get caught for the crime
That's why I keep it so real
Life after life, we might not talk, but I'm fine..
I'm at peace, one love man, fixed that beef
Can't nobody do it like that boy Lil B

[Outro]
That's real shit
Tell muthafuckas to sample that
Clear that, ya feel me?
For the clearance, Lil B Based God
This is history
