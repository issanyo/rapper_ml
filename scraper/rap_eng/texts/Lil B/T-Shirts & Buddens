[Intro]
Hey, Joe Budden
You're a motherfucking joke
I'm hip hop, rawest rapper alive

[Verse 1]
T-shirts and Buddens, this a fucking warning shot
Rap niggas wanna talk, I leave with your jaw dropped
Lil B for lil' boss, big talk, get your head cracked
I'm from the hood, niggas terrorist with no head wraps
Westside gangsta connected to the mob
Connected to the Roc like I'm J Cole
Shoot like I'm Steve Nash, 4-5 tuck with my weed stash
You fucking with a robbing ex killa, get your knees cracked
Internet got you thinking that you is a God
Real hip-hop over here, blood and tears over here
No bitch over here, bad bitches over here
No pussy over there, pump it up you're a queer
Tryna diss me when you got a fucking full beard
Sit down old man your back about to blow out
My rap like a gold mine, study in my dope rhymes
Rawest rapper in the game, it's like I'm sniffing coke lines
Losing all your hair Joe, think you need rogaine
Joe Budden Joe booty, what the fuck is yo name
Shut the fuck up with those depressing ass songs
It's the summer time, get some fucking pussy and go home
Pump it up, pump it up? Man, I'm finna fuck your bitch, Joey
Bitch, I'm Based God, I should write you a fucking hit Joey
Leave your fucking head ho, need a clip got me a rubber glip
Lil B for Lil Boss, I'm still screaming "Fuck A Bitch"
I'm 20 and you 45, you look like you're 55
Spit like I'm 65, eating pussy's 69
You're a nasty old man probably getting butt fucked
You run around Karate Kid, where's your fucking nun chucks?
Maybe you don't have none because you in the hood still
Probably selling X pills, probably eating asshole
Recording all your bitches you a motherfucking pervert
Joe Budden T.V, Joe Bitch T.V
See me in 3D I'm young but I'm ready jack
I dare you to comeback I won because I am rap
Rap like Saran wrap your model bitch saved you
Put him on the internet because don't nobody play you
Performing at cafes, you still underground
How you go mainstream and run back underground?
Joe Budden you're a clown please just forgive me
You shoulda followed fans and now your ass is gonna be history
Make you an example, I feed your ass samples
You're my own son that ain't never made it rapping
I tried to give you chances, you didn't take my hand out
And now you looking stupid as you did when you came out
And you ain't got no swag and you ain't got no cash
Joe Budden, you just ass

[Break]
Ahaha, nigga T-Shirt & Buddens
Ay, Joe Budden shut the fuck up

[Verse 2]
I have too much swag Joe don't bring your girl around
But this is about you Joe, the bay you don't come around
The world on my back now, bitch I run the internet
Ba-rang-dang-dang, I'm very smart very intricate
I can tell you jealous of Lil B, I'm lil boss
You mad I'm a pretty bitch, you mad you a gay bitch
You don't have no fucking niche, surprised you still got fans
Act like a grown man, Mood Muzik, go cry
Joe Budden go cry 'cause you a little fag boy
And go make a mixtape and mope over every song
Keep recording girlfriends, bet you still jack off
With your buttcheeks out listening to Mood Muzik
Screaming, "Lil B why the fuck you gotta Ether me"
I could of been your friend now your career is history
Joe Budden man you can suck my fucking dick
And tell the whole world
You got murdered by a pretty bitch
Lil B

[Outro]
Aye T-Shirts & Buddens
Rawest rapper alive
