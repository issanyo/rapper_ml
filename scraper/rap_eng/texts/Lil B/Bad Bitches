Verse 1 - Stunnaman
Shout out to my niggas from the Crack block
Yeah we leaning on to crack spot
And your man? he a mascot
As for me, I get flyer than that an astronaut
I'm a player, yeah I crush a lot, spaceship, I land in the parking lot
Killing this shit, I can't stop
I'm the shit now baby, like it or not
Them haters look small, when you on the top
Got them taking pictures when I'm in the spot

(Chorus)
Bad bitches, champagne, ...
Where them fucking haters at... they should see me now
Roll'em up just to burn them down
And they say they can hear the lean that's loud
Bad bitches, champagne, ...
Where them fucking haters at ... they should see me now

(Verse 2)
We just try to make it, fuck being famous
Never got a chance, yeah I had to take it
Tryina get that paper, tryina get these dollars
So if you ain't talking hunneds, don't even holler
Taught myself how to be a man, no father
Got me feeling like Wayne on that first Carter
Get money today, get money tomorrow
Straight racks and we got money you can borrow

(Chorus)

(Verse 3 - Lil B)
Feel good to be out in the hood my nigga
Stunnaman, I love you, bruh it's all good my nigga, BTown, I love you too, and them niggas is shady
They say I dont give back enough, Shit I'm just trying to get straight
Young nigga, mind right, I had to put down the weight
Shout out to ...and Reezy, I stayin out of the way
We all learn at different times, Shits simple and plain, but life is not easy, Them niggas leave the game like Rich Gannon
Shout out to young L, shout out to Lil Uno, man we gonna hold this shit down
Fuck the industrys homos, and niggas started getting mad when I'm talking about the gutter
I ain't the one to die in it, just to help the people thats from it
And they call me base guy because the nigga is real
If I was fake, motherfucker, I woulda signed me a deal
Shit, I'm still unsigned because I'm gutter as fuck with it
These words from my soul, because a nigga is stuck in it
Nigga, the Bay Area my home, and gonna be leaving it, and if Niggas got problems, then it's Fuck'Em season
And I got love within my soul and they ain't gonna raise the bar
And all my team around here, you know we ain't gonna take losses, Wolf Pack, 2012, Stunnaman, We bosses
It's Lil B, I love ya'll niggas, man. Till the end we fuckin bosses, BasedGod, We ain't taking losses, nigga

(Chorus)
