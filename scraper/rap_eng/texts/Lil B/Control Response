(Hook: Lil B)
Imma hit a nigga with the AK, Imma stand here on the front line, Check this out, Everybody said what they gon' do, I'm down for the war I'm not scared to die

It's Lil B, 05 fuck 'em

(Verse 1: Lil B)
Niggas want war and they cock and they aiming
Last summer I spent a year with my stainless
Niggas get baseball dug out
Coming for the bricks, and somebody's got drugs out
Killed the wrong person, suppose to be the drug house
You was a drug lord, I want to get the plug route
I'm tired of being sick and tired
I want a little health
Niggas watch me, when I'm finna die
Help me, don't record me on the phone
Put the gun in your mouth and I'll make you gorgeous
You got money so niggas dropping charges
Niggas get pressed up and niggas get extorted
I was paying debts and I was getting beat up
Bitch, until I kicked my feet up
Now I make niggas hold the choppas
I make bitches suck dick
And I hold snitches hostage
Lil B

(Hook)

Yes

(Verse 2: Lil B)
I light up the jail, I own it
I'm finna buy stock in it
Fuck it, you niggas getting betted on
You better sit
I see metta, metta the world so strong
My niggas putting dope in the back
The clerk knows my voice, could clear every case for me
When you got money, you got it lined up
I'm talking pre-school rind up
With that coke in the iron
I was selling off dope in the iron
I was bagging up zips like fire
I'm in deep, I'm the con-man
I was lining up, K-Mart
Niggas know I got heart
You feel me?
The propaganda hate black, my niggas too smart
I put peoples through hell, put him in the dark
Niggas snitched on 'em
Man, them niggas wasn't smart
And I dropped 'em in the dark, nigga

(Hook)
You know what I'm saying? It's only one way in and one way out in this game 05 fuck 'em
