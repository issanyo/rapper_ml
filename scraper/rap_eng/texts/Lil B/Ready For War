[Intro]
This real Bitch Mob
Respect Da Bitch Volume 1
You know this shit real deep, man
This some mafia shit

[Verse 1]
I'm a mafia boss, bitch, I run the city
Bitch Mob the only niggas that fuck wit me
You can ask for help, I'm a ask for guidance
Put the pistol in his mouth, bitch, don't cry
I come from a bloodline of forgotten kings
Based World the only label that fuck wit me
Throw it up one time for the dead family
Yeah, they didn't make it, so we got a party
Life too hard for niggas to be trippin' out
They in jail or dead because the game flipped em'
I'm a tell you like this, I ain't a dumb man
I ain't a real nigga, just a real man
I got twenty-four to five if you wanna get it
When you plug, you show love, boy, it's nothin' to it
When you Lil B, you always gotta love a hater
Without fake niggas, I wouldn't become greater

[Interlude]
Know what I mean?
Bitch Mob we practice what we preach
You know what I mean
We don't practice retaliation
We fight with non-violence
Let's get it

[Verse 2]
It's real talk, the mothafuckin' game shifted
Nobody ever did what the fuck I'm doin'
Turned the laptop to ten million plus people
Cop green squeeze things and they whole simmies
Sound good till you can't be playin' wit it
Got out the hood before these niggas started dyin'
Took my boy life, the rap game violent
Don't respect my body, nigga, spâ€”sneak killin'
Each doin' a man jail cause he fuckin' stupid
I ain't tryin' to be harsh, just a lil' angry
Lost love when the last bitch nigga played me
Fifty cal in my pants, and I'm givin' rabies
Nigga looked me in my eyes, you could see I'm crazy
Got a fire in my soul from these cowards hatin'
Swear to God you boys want these mothafuckin' missiles
I'm a have to show war that war ain't a issue

[Outro]
I have to show war that war ain't an issue
You know what I mean?
Nigga we goin' against the war, we goin' against the grain
Bitch Mob Respect Da Bitch Volume 1
Lil B, I'm bringing the pain
If you rep that Bitch Mob shit, just know man
This the realest shit ever
Lil B, Based World
Know what I mean
Lil B, Bitch Mob
Nigga we worldwide with it
That's what it is
Swag
