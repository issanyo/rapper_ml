Please protect me from these suckers
While I keep my head up and I stay strong on these motherfucking suckers

I know what pain is, false dreams
Niggas been phony off top, had to show 'em some things
That's work at night
Twerk at night
Shit come rough, it get worse some nights
Fuck with, real niggas that earned some stripes
Fake stripes mental, real stripes get you life
You don't want that, talk to the lawyer
You be thinking you coming home, they give you 20 and you're 50
Now your brain's shifting
That's a long time to stay doing the jail house bid
That's a cell house curse
Niggas blinding in the hood
And the jail house worse
That's that jail house curse
Dove head first
Fell face first
Check game worst
Get much worst
Cops came second
Gets much worst
Public defender, no more worth
No more trials, no more work
Pain's in yourself
How you gone deal with that look in yourself?
How you gone, when nobody gone call you?
How you gone have real when them, getting salty?
Hurt your heart and them niggas in the struggle
I ain't even good, them niggas don't even know
And I'm straight bruh, I'm coming to fuck with you
Only got one life and I'm finna chase rap
Only got one brain that's a damn fact
Got the right to bust my fucking chops cause I'm the motherfucking BasedGod
Got love on the motherfucking block
Even if niggas hate, I still got the drop top
Still got the pop
And I'm still making hits
Still with the shit
Can't see, too sick
Too legit to quit
Beam on the tip
Stop the gun violence, put the guns down
Why you gone waste life?
Niggas is sheist(y)
The government is weird, I won't need to tell you right
Who's the front? I keep the game fighting
Who gives a fuck? I want right
I wake up today, I sleep at night
