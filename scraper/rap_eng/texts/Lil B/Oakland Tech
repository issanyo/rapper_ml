[Intro]
You know
Lil B number one in the rap
Rawest rapper alive
You feel me

[Verse]
Talking to you, Imma tell you what I feel inside
A whole lot of pain and bitch a whole lot of pride
A whole lot of things that I could've did at night
Coming out the wild west be getting to you right
I'm leaving the places that I loved the most
Big business at the table, and nobody toast
Glock nine at you, leave your whole body posted
Call me Boston Market, left that chick and roasted
I seen ups, I seen down and I ain't seen my posters
In the hood like task force, I'm steps closer
Nigga just overed me, respect over
Most people got potential but who really hold her
Raps coming out my boy, they all golden
I'm running, route like (?)
Coming straight off the corner like (?)
I be aiming for the sky, no stopping or fold 'em
Sold zips off the corner, don't care if its rolling
Police pull me over 'cause the car look stolen
Same plates that I got, the same plates I eat with
How many people feeding the block
Same way the block buy pop, I rock the top
My top 150K just to clean the roof
I had bad days, I hustled 'til the cab came
Then I kept going, kept riding
Kept knowing, kept showing
I'm the best with the mother fucking tech blowing
Still looking like Oakland how the tech's showing
You can't fuck with me bitch
