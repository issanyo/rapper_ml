[Verse 1]
Cocaine money, dope game money
In the strip club throwing another bitch money
Bitch tryna chose but ain't nothing funny
I'm trying to cash out bitch I'm trying to spend money
I'm in it like [?] and my nose still running
Chewing on pills, shake it like a wheel
In the strip club bitch I look like for real
Five thousand dollars bitch tell me what it feel
Tryna cash out bitch you know what's the deal
Shake it like that, twerk it like that
Woo, woo, woo, you don't know how to act
Woo, woo, woo, bitch I'm trying to throw racks
Shake it to the floor, you know how it go
Word around town I cash out on a ho
If you is a pimp man I'm tryna buy a ho
If you is a pimp bitch I'm tryna buy a ho

Girl throw your booty out them pants with that dance
Girl throw your booty out them pants with that dance

Got free pussy when I paid her for the dance
We don't gotta fuck girl, I just wanna dance
You can cuddle up bitch, I'm tryna hold hands

Forty years later bitch tryna fuck again
