I can't play with none of these hoes
You know what I'm sayin
Ain't no time to play games
It's ya boy lil b
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Got bricks in the floor, bricks in the safe
I can't afford to be scared I'm tryna be safe
Safes get broke so I keep it smooth
Bitch told me that, so I play it cool
Her dude locked up, but she wanna fuck me
Hit the pussy raw, like a trick dummy (trippin)
I don't give a fuck, the bitch don't love me
Too young to be with me, mind on her money
My mind on myself, so I'm fine dummy
Only thing I'm worried about? Is my money (yesss)
I got family in the struggle so I gotta help em
A while back, beat with orange belts (ba ba ba)
I used to be a nerd, but I'm not a snitch
I used to be a trick, but I'm not a bitch (not a bitch)
Only time I'm a bitch is when I rep the Bitch (mob)
I forgive niggas, I plead the 5th

[I smoke a sucka fast for, playin games
Not tellin jokes, or not sayin names
You niggas think it's funny but I beat yo ass
You laughed in my face now I'mma kill yo ass] x2

[Verse 2: Lil B  again]
Got bricks in the car, bricks in the couch
Still frontin off dope when I'm in a drought (yesss)
Breakin walls down til they not there (not there)
Buy another pack im moving outta here
It seems so far, but I'm getting closer
I'm not a normal dude, need a chaffeur
Buy another brick then, sell it like soda
Open up the can, I got coca cola
I need it for myself I keep takin risks (risks)
I'm born self-ish, I can't love a bitch (can't love her)
I only love a woman, with her mind straight
And if the girl ain't mine, she on a blind date (yess)
1st or 2nd place you gotta ask yourself
If you cool with being last or you need the belt
I need to be 1st I can't be last
I'm addicted to the money (money), I need cash


[I smoke a sucka fast, for playin games
Not tellin jokes, or not sayin names
You niggas think it's funny but I beat yo ass
You laughed in my face, now I'mma kill yo ass] x2

[Verse 3: Lil B at his rawest, and his friend]
I keep playin cards, the hand I was dealt
Life on earth sometimes is hell
I stand with faith my life gon prevail
My brother hate his job but he gotta sell (yess)
"I can't sell out so I gotta sell
All this pain that I seen, you gotta live and tell"
He said that his job just hold him back
He got 24 hours losing 12 of that
I told him he could quit, and go ship packs
But who am I to say, 'where the weight at?' (Yess)
I keep making stops just gotta rebuild
If my car lose gas I gotta be prepared (yasss)
I'm using downtime just to gain knowledge
School for connection, life is my college
You gotta have a vision of you wanna make it
Man this life will snatch you up, and strip you naked
