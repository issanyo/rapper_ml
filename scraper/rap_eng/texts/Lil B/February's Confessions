[Intro]
It's your boy Lil B
You know I got a lot of shit on my mind
Got a lot of things I just need to talk about
First off I want tell everybody I love them
And I just appreciate being alive
You feel me?

[Verse 1]
I bring you back to last year
No dollars bruh
Until we changed the game
The whole world followed us
A lot of people part of us
But they not who started us
They stealing money
Now acting like they charging us
It's not about the money
It's the attitude that's harming us
Had the team thinking I was leaving on the charter bus
What's this about the album?
Niggas is so foul
Saying "our management" (What?)
But they don't manage shit (Never)
Niggas left me in the park for five years
I got stabbed in my back
Man up, that shit's real
Niggas know that I love 'em to the end
And if you is my friend you gon' tell me what it is
I'm all ears and I keep my eyes open
Last time I fell asleep I left the game wide open
Last time I fell asleep I almost got my neck broken
Charge it to the hood
I might leave his face smoking
Lil B

[Pondering to the sounds of Toto's I Won't Hold You Back]
What has happened to me?
Oh...
Sh...
Yes...
You know I'll just...
I'll never do it again

[Verse 2]
Bruh, a lot of niggas claiming they got trust issues
Man, if I smell a sucker I can't fuck with you
Every year a nigga switch up on you
Man he say he called my phone
He was never my homie
All of a sudden niggas start to think we're friends from Middle School
That's why I never spoke on you in my interviews
They say I'm crazy cause I'm fucked up, maybe
I been ran over, played with, left for crazy
I been locked in that courtroom, down in Oakland
Nigga scarred from YA
But he kept on rolling
We all sing the same tune
But I chose to wake up
Changed my whole mindset and I got my cake up
But I ain't change too much
Niggas still is leeches
Still got the same skin and I'm happy I'm breathing
And if I wronged you in my past
I'm sorry
I suffer inside and that's the worst thing for me
Lil B

[Pondering to the sounds of Toto's I Won't Hold You Back]
Man, I got so many questions
Like I said
They ask
If I could do it again all over again, would I do it?
Yeah, I'd do it all over again
But do it way better
I love this life

[Verse 3]
Gotta do it for my uncles
You don't even know what's in my soul
They deserve the whole goal (I love y'all!)
They wanted me to stop
But I gotta keep going
I ride through West Oakland
I'm near the Greyhound
I put the grapes down cause these niggas like me slipping
I stay with the Mac
It's sorta like I'm pimping
I can't speak on it
But I don't condone it
Live your own life and be happy for them moment
Just cause you got it don't mean you own it
Just cause you bought it don't mean that you flaunt it
We starving at the moment
Sitting in the office
Another damn referral, man I see this paper often
Fuck 'em if they don't understand my genius, bitch
I'll be Albert Einstein times a million, bitch
And I'm still saving people on a daily basis
Another reason why these bitch motherfuckers hating
It's Lil Boss

[Pondering to the sounds of Toto's I Won't Hold You Back]
I'm Lil Boss
Lil Berkeley
Lil B
Lil Based God
Lil Based
Some motherfuckers even had the nerve to say Lil Bitch
Fuck 'em
Bitch Mob fi-yaaah
You feel me?
