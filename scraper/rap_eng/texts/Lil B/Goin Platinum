[Intro]
Oh yeah, baby, I'm feelin' ready for the game
I know y'all been waitin' for me
My first album goin' platinum
I'm finna sign a multi-million dollar deal
We talkin' billions, nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm pushin' 'til the end, niggas mad I'm hustlin'
I'm rich, y'alls rap street nigga, you don't understand
I'm in a hole in the wall
You don't feel me cracked in the wall, my back to the wall
I'm back in the hall, niggas mad I'm strugglin'
Niggas so jealous, back then, get knocked out back then
Seein' things back then, put the burner to ya, then ya
I'mma juice niggas and take a sip
I was born purple, never been irked
You feel me, I was never Urkel
I was mad at them niggas that was, yeah, never jealous
Young nigga with the [?] passion
Basketball wasn't nothin' for me, I was a star
But nigga I ain't touch the league
Everything customers needed, nigga I got it
Plantin' seeds in the hood, nonviolent
I seen murder, I seen burglars
I seen street niggas that came with the burner
I had dreads, I never hit the head shop
My dreads locked, I'm real they're not
Street nigga, in the game I'm hot
My niggas was doin' things and they was stayin' hot
Pushin' niggas back to the classics
I was ridin' hot whips, you was never in traffic
This is real shit, man, I'm always smashin'
If you don't hear your name, you ain't a factor
I'm a 90's baby, I'm a 80's baby
Dope in the 90's and it go for 80, baby
Based God, nigga, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm Eminem, I'm so shady, baby
This Lil B, 05 Fuck Em
