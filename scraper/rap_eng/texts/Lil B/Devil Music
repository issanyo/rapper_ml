[Intro]
Red Flame
Yeah, you know niggas so swagged up
East side what up, Lil B
Shouts out to Pocus
I'm overseas
Red Flame Devil Music
Shouts out

[Verse]
Niggas devour hour up after hour
My focus up on the game, control it and getting power
The people scared of change, the world is getting sour
Since it's cool to lie about the struggle
Rappers play their positions so well with no position
With the gifted outside
No division, no league or nothing
It's no mental, it's nothing
But niggas cock blocking, systems is overflooding
A lot of weak discussions from people that owe me nothing
Look 'em straight up in their eyes, they want that money
They kill in silence, watch the people
But they violent, I gotta spread the message through
People are rhyming [?] Berkeley streets
Niggas thought I was stressing, I didn't
I know I had a secret plan to become a legend
Word around town I appreciated my blessings
And be humbled by the fact that I could be gone in seconds
Be humbled by the fact I wasn't with no disease
Just keep me in your prayers while I'm writing and reading
Vibe out

[Outro]
Welcome to Red Flame
It's that Red Flame Devil Music
One for the drummer
East Coast what up
New Jersey what up
New York what's up
Carolina what's up
It's Lil Boss, one for the drummer
Devil Music what's up
Red Flame, yeah
Shouts out to Young Chris
Shouts out to Jay-Z
