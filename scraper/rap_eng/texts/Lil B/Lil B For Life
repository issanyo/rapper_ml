[Intro]
Yesssss. You know what I'm saying. I wanna say thank you Lil B for doing what you do, and thank you for listening

[Verse]
The last verse caused my emotions to crumble
Cause I talk to the beat and he's talking through me
It's talking through me, why you talking B?
I'm getting kind of mad cause niggas don't give me my respect
Put the image I project something like a vet
Cause my engine run smooth like a 'vette
Put you in check without having... fuck that
You feel me, I'm a king and you a rook
Like checkers crown me
It's a board game a lot of you rappers getting kind of bored man
Now I'm on a level, fuck 'em
Sit back and relax, listen to the beats, fuck 'em
You feel me, hands down I'm the rawest out
These motherfuckers play games, palms up, balls out
You feel me, nigga I don't play around cause I ain't got time
If I would I would've been wearing my watch
But you moving counterclock wise, look at the clock
Where the fuck you at man, where the day stop?
100% Gutta everyday I rock
Put the raps in the oven and put the mic in the pot
Let me rip this shit up and let me hop on the block
The fiends can't wait man til this music drop
You feel me
Til this music drop
Man the fiends can't wait man til this music drop

[Outro]
Know what I'm saying. I love you, and I really love you man. So thank you Lil B for real, for life
