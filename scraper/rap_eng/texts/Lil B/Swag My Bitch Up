[Hook x2]
Swag my bitch up, swag my bitch up
God damn Lil B, swag my bitch up
Swag my bitch up, Swag my bitch up
Thank you Based God, swag my life up

[Verse 1]
Fuck domestic laws, I'ma beat the bitch up
You niggas cry for bitches, y'all some faggot-ass niggas
Y'all crackers suck dick, and that's just how it go
I don't give a fuckin' shit about no punk-ass ho (You're racist)
That bitch better respect me, that bitch better protect me
Got a lot of fucking [?] and I get high easily
Bitch tried to lie to me, that bitch trynna lie to me
You might be a fuckin' faggot
No homo, I'll put a bitch in a fuckin' casket
Mouth just struggling, niggas out here mad at me
They came out hatin', I came out struggling'
I inherited nothing, I'm still gettin' this money
I'm out here livin' to the fullest
Boss money, put it on your dummies

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Bitch try to finesse me, I slapped the bitch like Gucci
The bitch tried to lie to me, she must be smoking chewy
Tried to put me on child support
I'ma beat the bitch up in front of everybody, in court (Don't lie)
I'm not a good liar and I'm not a good faker
But I'm a real boss, and I never been no hater
I respect women, and I respect all people
But I don't love hoes, they suck dick and they're evil
These bitches want my money, (Yep)
These bitches think I'm stupid
Bitches got caught in the trap, I'ma show the bitch who's clueless
This bitch is livin' for a bag
Bitch I'ma fuck you in that ass for that motherfuckin' bag
I flax on bitches, so I might beat her ass
I still (?) bitches, I love it
I'm still doin' numbers, I'm still flexin' under
I still take pussy, and I'm flexin' baby hummer
