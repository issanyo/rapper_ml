[Verse]
We in hurr
BasedGods in hurr
Fuckin' bitches in hurr
Niggas know we don't care
Asking questions bout work
Bitch prolly gettin scurred
Boy prolly in there
Niggas come with that furr
Based drummin down your ear
Glock 40 with the square
Bitch I ain't never have furr
Livin' life, I dont care

Send the bitch over here
Like it, I dont care
But fuck her like I got nerf
Smokin' on that work

Locked up, I dont care
Bitch mob, over here
Bitches just like work

Switched up, I have nerve
Loyalty is just a word
Got what you deserve
Niggas hatin' around here
Catchin' cases around here
Heavy funk around here
Box Chevy around here
Bitch mob around here (BasedGod!)
