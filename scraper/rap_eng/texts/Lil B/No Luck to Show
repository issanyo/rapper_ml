Yo, where this money at
I'm still kicking it

You know what I love
Ay, tell that beautiful girl
To come give me a hug
You already know, man
It's your boy, Lil Boss
In this motherfucker, man
It's your boy, Lil B
I'm just telling these thug stories
You feel me?

Ay, See I'm stuck with foes
And you stuck on gold
You haters stuck at shows
With no luck to show
So I speak abrupt to show
Where my nuts can go
A lot of niggas go nuts
Cause they cuts is low
Your V-12 demo sucks, plus
No blunts to show
And you a fake-ass rapper
No fun to show that's why I
Get much love, you gettin shit to go
My hollow tip whips slugs
Don't get plugged and poked
And I fucked a lot of bitches
Plus I plugged they throat
And I tell them many lies like
Hoes love to hope, like
I want to get rich, you, you broke
Treating hoes like sunny
Give them scars to show
Like, B, I love you man, but ain't no love to show
Unlike my round, resort to drugs and coke
And I get big love
I'm putting drugs on boats
Delivering them to thugs, putting slugs in coats
It's Lil B

Ooh, bitch, it feels like 1985
BasedPrint Volume 2, you feel me
It's a beautiful day out hear in the U.S.A

Cause you got to be above
Cause your [?] are [?]
If you want to be a thug
Take your bugs to [?]
And you got to erase and just
Plus your blunts are broke
Man, you selling all the albums, man you niggas is hoes
The doctors showing up, man
What's in your liver, man
Only one to be busy B, You see it
I see lil niggas making peace treaties but live it
I see the fear factor, got guns in the coffin
Why everybody crying?
Man, they dying laughing and coughing
Cause it's very funny, man
Niggas is passin often
Acting, niggas become targets from laughing and walking
Just like they get more strapped to they chest
Niggas strapping they vest, hittin they head often
I don't think you should walk around
When you feel awful
Because niggas will brainwash you
Take you back like cockwork
And then what's the time?
Yeah, I rinsed my clockwork
Ya bitch

You know, we just lettin off
You know, shit, I'm just hella based
Basedprint Volume 2
Basedworld, you understand
That's all that matters

Make another track, I'll see you later
It's hard work
Your bitch come jocking, it's funny
She's at hard twerkin
She know if I'm really want..I really wanna
Yeah, she really wanna
Man, all she got to do is
Holla, man, and I will, you know
Holla at the bitch
100, Lil B, BasedPrint Volume 2
