[Intro]
Yeah, it's your boy Lil B, you know what I'm talking about
R.I.P. DJ Screw, you know I'm based all day based freestyle

[Verse]
In my mind I stay crazy all the time
Stay straight up on the grind, straight to the nine but
It's in my mind,shit blows every day
Glock sparks in my head, leave 'em they on this side are you coming or ride
I act surprised but really they know half of them guys
Riding fuck around we living under ties
Fuck the tires, you need ties all in them shoes see the piles
You seemed surprised, niggas ride me I rock the flyes
I'm up in there, top of the world top of the sides
I ain't seeing shit had to dim the lights
Flicked the led in my stuff and them blow up on my blunt
Lean and hennessy I mix it, my liver started tripping
Sit back and get it , I sip it I live it
I do what I do ,these people just pitch it
You feel me, they just won't compete you
I just see it, I'm rocking I'm pitching
Solving, everybody know what's the word
Everybody know what's the curve
You know I keep my head on the street
And this based world freestyle head all day
I live but I gotta treat my head by the bay
Keep my eyes open I sleep by the way
Then sleep by the wave if I sleep by the day
People know about me I sleep by my ways
You know about me I sleep by the phase
And I burn my heart gon' burn, I leave them senseless
Fuck your tears bitch I don't need to be seen
I'm coming with the infa green, infa beam and know it
Coming through and sold you and everybody know it we roll it
We homeless cause our body outside
Embody the inside, embody you outside
Take your shit out right
Take your trash out at night,bitch all around
I'mma comin' before the light I'm gonna do everything
Real beast at everything, rock it out for Mary Jane
Rocking out for every kid,every queer
Based real know that I got your back
It's Lil B for Lil Boss fuck that crack

[Outro]
Yeah, Based freestyle
Just the based music this my heart
You know how we do it
Ye ye based I see it
Based God, it's your boy lil B
