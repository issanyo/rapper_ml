(Hook: Lil B)
You know I finna fuck your bitch
And then you wonder why she was leaving you
You're mad because she was sucking my dick
I really waterfront 700
She's riding 'round town on my dick
Cause all these young bitches is sucking me
I'm young Based god on a bitch
I'm staying based for ever man

(Intro: Lil B)
Man, y'all don't want no autotune, nigga
Y'all only need one verse
I'm killng it

(Verse 1: Lil B)
I'm riding 'round town like Armstrong. Ain't long
I rep for Btown You writing fables like Aesop
Niggas like me, I come equipped with the AR
And leave 'em on the ground and I ain't talking 'bout the Par-ar
Medics. Off-brand niggas couldn't guess it
You get it? Guess it
I hate asking questions
Speaking on the mic, I swear to God it's a blessing
I'm the freestyle king, and it's not Little Flipper
Your bitch come around. I be pulling down my zipper
She be like "AOW!"
I be like "AOW!"
I look like God
Call me Based god
I'm like Jay-Z, but I'm spitting straight bars
"AOW!"
I been have enough Minaj
Both blue eyes for the pretty rapp-ar
Damn, Lil B! You be living in the stars
Gas on deck like it came from the car

(Hook)
