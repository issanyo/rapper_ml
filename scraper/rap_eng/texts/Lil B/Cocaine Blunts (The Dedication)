[Intro]
Yeah, shouts out to Cocaine Blunts
I got a few blunts no cocaine I spit dope

[Verse 1]
Shit I come in the game shit growing up twisted
How can I be fake, I was breaking glass no wrenches
OK, you dudes rap but the game not rap
Call outside chat this is not iChat
Just because you got chips don't mean you rich
That just means you get money, and I make that flip
See, I'm the kind of boss that would take that trip
I will fuck with a nigga, we will take that trip
Bruh your partner's got a gun you ain't built for the trip
Will forget his lunch box but won't forget that clip
Not talking about the movies Ebert & Roep
See you smoke then you know that you was seeing a ghost
Bruh, ask for the beef we was leaving em toast
Yes, my life is not glitz and glamour
I'm a pretty bitch my big cousin toted that hammer
Real niggas, trill niggas even with my family
Just because your bitch bad don't mean you fancy
No rap nigga want it lyrical I'm sick
I'm sick like the dude that threw up in piss
Bra I'm too sick for real too short for real
Your bitch felt too short that's before the deal
I used to move cars out so I floored the steel
Sell them off for $500 just to close the deal
I close up deals like my lawyers will
Won't eat a girl out, but my lawyers will
Ho tryed to sue me, I exposed they skills
How can I die, when I created a world
Best thing you try to do is stay out my swirl
And the girls love me too so stay out that girl
My nigga I'm CLR
And I'm not bilingual but my bitch is way too foreign
Take shots at me, bet I think your drinks is boring
When I'm out making base you was sleeping snoring
A boy test me, that's a test he fail
He fail like the dude that slipped in jail
Al Capone ice chain I'm going straight to hell
Bury me with Based God don't forget the real
You gon buy a new coffin don't forget the nails
I'm dead already so I'm blessed as well
And I feel Michael Jackson celebrity knowledge
I'mma turn white too, I'mma bleach my face
Cause I'm the realest nigga out but you can't see my face
Bet I turn my skin white I won't catch that case (that case)
Cocaine blunts straight to the face nigga

[Outro]
I'm smoking blunts no cocaine in em
I'm raw dope nigga
Lil B for Lil Boss this a dedication
Fuck all you rap niggas
Fuck all you comment niggas that hate on me
I'm in the thang nigga I'm deep in the game nigga
Real nigga in this bitch
Heavy in this bitch
Sick in this bitch
Cocaine blunts in this bitch
Based blunts in this bitch
