[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You feel me
It's some real sh..
Water is D.M.G
Yeah, yeah

To me, can ya, do ya feel me
Yeah, yeah, I said do ya feel me

[Verse 1]
Can you relate to someone who had nothing
Crack something just to give his lower back cover
Mack something just to ? he goes running
But it's nothing cause his knee caps worn out from running
Now it's humming, black suits sitting right above ya
With the coffin engraved
With your mother crying ?
Two weeks we be on the covers then
Don't say goodbye cause I'm *blank* ya *blank*
When they hug 'em in, you know the oozie ?
Had too many people dying in the future
But I'm just chilling hearing sirens after I do ya
Something on the TV, we on the news
What?

I can't lie

[Verse 2]
I'm blowing out his brains
Cop taking names
On the pen and the pad
Forensic scientists gather around his body bag
Only two hours, and his whole body black
Candles and memorials already set up for his fuckin' ass
But I don't give a fuck, it was that bitch from the fuckin' past
Things change and I had to let the shells rip
Ain't no gun or knife, I'm on a tail whip
Asking no questions, just blowing through the chest
You feel me
As I explain to the judge and the jury about my cases
Got a ? under some fucking replacements
I don't know why they keep asking the same questions
I'm finna give 'em a blessing
Finna teach a lesson
Water is D.M...
Water is D.M.G
You feel me
