[Intro]
I think something is burning
And now you've ruined the whole thing

[Verse 1]
I wish I could move but I'm closed in
My heart getting old in a young man
I've given up on every other man
Positive is of the plans
The human show me suffering
It's most wanted in communities:
Taxes and water is adored like
Oil when it's poured in the ocean
By mistakes of machines
Cause we're lazy human beings
Discreditin' our genes
We're very smart nonetheless
But enslave our own selves
As color is division
Who made up these visions?
Wanna slap him for his actions
My heart burn with passion

[Bridge]
My heart's burning

[Verse 2]
Please let me see the road cleared
The weed smoke is very clear
Evident: my rap lyrics, heaven-sent
Underground legend to a small few
Mainstream to most ones
Close run, Uh, root for me
Like I haven't won none
Scream like it's no lungs
And take it loud
I'm talking loud
Don't nobody hear me?
Don't nobody care?
I seem to stare at walls
My eyes red, devilicious. Eyed 'em?
The people made me into a monster
My heart getting darker
Ridiculed for what?
Because I'm looking at you awkward?
I'm saying what I feel, bitch
And I'm moving forward
I'm at the point where I idolize lawyers
People's liars
Undercover with suppliers
Tryin' to buy 'er
Always purchased
Filled my pain at the surface
Staying all night like a nurse is
This studio, I cursed it

[Bridge]
I lost my mind
Check me, I lost my mind

[Verse 3]
You made me two faced
Your burned my face
To live on earth with people is beautiful
Underneath, it's horrible
I'm bleeding for this rap game
Similar to crack 'caine
I sold nothin'; focused
Riding round town to the lonesome
Scrooge McDuck, backseat phantom
With a bad attitude:
Fuck the world
I think I'm burning
