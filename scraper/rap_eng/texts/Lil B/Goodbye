[Sample]
I can see the pain living in your eyes
And I know how hard you try
You deserve to have so much more
I can feel your heart and I sympathize
And I'll never criticize all you've ever meant to my life

[Intro: Lil B]
Uh, just walk up to this real fast
Real niggas...

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?
You can buy all the clothes but your boy's still cold
Everything not gold, and everything don't glitter
Summertime I might shiver, wintertime I might bake
It's crazy when you think how much time you got left
And don't stress all the time, cause time stress when you bless
Things stretch when you guess, just give it all to next
And the things you can achieve are beyond success
Of another person out, give another person game
It come back to you as a present of the same
We the same, but we not sane
Really thinking about it deep, I'm insane
Don't think about it cause we moving autopilot

[Hook]
You would never ask me why
My heart is so disguised
I just can't live a lie anymore
I would rather hurt myself
Than to ever make you cry
There's nothing left to say, but goodbye

[Verse 2: Lil B]
21, I'm grown now, celebration
New watch, new ice, new my set complete
Too deep, the sunny days that's ahead of me
Yeah I'm rolling up a blunt, feeling up, swishes
Posting up with European style, rich and underrated
Settle for the top, yeah, nigga that's an understatement
Reminiscing on my days that I'm in the hood
Now I'm waking up daydreaming, sleeping in the 'burbs
Man, I feel like a profit (?) I sit back chauffeur
Ride by the ocean, hit the club, watch girls look at me
I feel good with my job, I just pay to breathe
Lil Boss, goodbye

[Hook]

[Outro]
Goodbye...
Goodbye...
