This niggas ain't no gangtas, these niggas more like some wankstas
Way before the rapping I'm way prone to clap 'em
I come from underworld ratchets the ones that fit in my baggage
The ones you take, and you ask, and I ask them niggas don't brag it
I fight but never stab 'em, niggas constantly bragging
On murders they don't commit you heard it, and plus your snitch
And partners if you think you're real, niggas be playing roles
I'm sick of the crack and hoes, niggas up on the corner
Corner be like a coroner, I come and place your order
Coming back next morning, like I'm Mr. Rogers
Out my t-shirt, bow tie, niggas fly
I'm fly to the point niggas die and they cry
Bitches lie, saying they fucked me, them bitches lying
Probably licked my mustache, half of them girls tried
I bust back, four five, make 'em see two times
See two nines, women, this is six twenty
Bitch I got perfect eyes
Mind dark, brown like the wood, I'm OG
I got new guns, shit that make you go pee
Niggas going to war, but they don't want beef
And why these niggas lying?
Trying to die in their own movie
Move, man, you feel me?
I tried my whole damn life and I'm still trying
How it feel to be on trial, you lost your life
Put it in the air man, alright, it's fair game boys don't do it right
How I sleep at night knowing niggas shist?
I know I bust a boy grape, put the pistol to his face
Man his face is the same place that you wake
Wake him up, drink the coffee, fuck smelling
I try nothing, who am I? I'm just real
Cause I done did that, did that, did that
Take that, break that, mayhem, shit, ASAP, Ace said
Get that click clack, yeah, lay his face at
ASAP, and I'mma ride on him, boy, like the race track
Why I got so much anger? Victimized by a stranger
Now I got thirty guns tempered to bang 'em
It's a lot of segregation, I'm tempted to hang 'em
Spot a man, I sense danger
My lawyer on the phone, he help me with situations
He told me be cool and stay out of them confrontations
Save a lotta money instead of leaving them bloody
Unstead of taking his soul, better man, you just go, smoke and go home
Go take that long road, we'll get your mind right, bruh, fuck them assholes
Niggas took losses man that's how the game goes
Niggas switchen they roles, people lie and they troll
Try to take control, you would never know
You would never know, you would never know
That's how the game goes, you would never know
Before I lay him down to rest, I sleep with my vest on my chest
My chest piece complements my fresh
You ain't never seen a killer pretty bitch
With a bad bitch, he look better than who?
You got me fucked up, your girls wear make up
Lil B, natural, I'm a thief with a passion, wronged in my past
I peed in beds, so I went to the bruce so I didn't bust heads
And I ain't just bread, I ain't just scared of the feds
You feel me? It's for the haters that want me dead
This for the haters that want me dead
This for the motherfucking haters that want me dead
But as long as my niggas here, man, I'm never leaving Earth
I rep Based World 'till the end, that's my real friends
Niggas switch up and they snitch, man, I see you bitch
You feel me man?
I think I'm Kareem Campbell because I never switch
I think I'm Kareem Campbell because I never switch
I think I'm Kareem Campbell cause I never switch
