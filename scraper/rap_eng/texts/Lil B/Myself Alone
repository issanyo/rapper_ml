[Intro]
Evil Red Flame
I'm that shit

[Verse 1]
I can kill off these niggas, I'm taking ever shot
The game need Lil B, the world need BasedGod
Lift 'em up, I swear to God I could pick 'em up
Treat 'em like volleyball, I guess I had to hit 'em up
Word on the street I started getting cake now
But best believe in the hood soaking up game
[?] under contracts
Niggas stop [?] when you touch your first hundred million
The game run by the under bosses
Can't lie, took a couple losses
Best believe in reinforcements
Catch me smoking in the oval office
Give a fuck if it's gonna cost me
Young BasedGod bitch
I'll be damned if you piss me off
Rawest rapper in the game, anyone I came across
And I bet my soul on that
By myself I kill tracks
Bitch Mob, Lil B nigga, what's up

[Chorus Sample]
Myself alone, will have to do
Myself alone, will have to do

[Interlude]
Haha and this me by myself nigga

[Verse 2]
I done realized I'm the rawest at it
Lot of niggas mad, a lot of stolen swag
Lot [?] all good
Til your mama crying cause your cable ain't due
Niggas forgot I was raised off of canned food
Salvation army still wouldn't stop me
Only made me hungry
Ma put me in clothes on layaway
Spent two years just to pay it off, I love her for that
When I was young I didn't understand to be black you gotta be a man
Understand all races got different problems
We all one, we got one option
Niggas think of the world stopping
Music's still here, BasedWorld here
Make sure Lil B live forever
I done did it for you, BasedGod forever

[Chorus Sample]
Myself alone, will have to do
Myself alone, will have to do

[Outro]
Niggas can't fuck with me
Evil Red Flame
Let's keep this shit rocking
Best mixtape ever
