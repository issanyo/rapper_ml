[Intro]
Some of the realest shit, you know what it is
You know I be dropping classics, Lil B

[Verse 1]
All my niggas battle for money
The snakes is in the grass, they know it
[?], like I drive a train
Violence, they see me rocking everything the court system fucked up
Rikers Island, Lil Wayne
Put me in jails, bet I'll be a better man
Fuck rappers, a lot of you niggas deal with Satan
No illuminati, niggas just be faking
I ride the bus everyday you niggas think I'm playing
I stay strict to the concrete
Real struggle over here give a fuck what your parents gave you
No legends like me got many favors
Niggas like you, owe many favors
I'm a boss mafioso to all my closest peeers I've been rocking with, still respect me still
And it's Berkeley to the end my nigga
Real Wolf Pack dude to the end, my nigga
Ain't nobody gave me shit, but a pen my nigga
Most of the guys in jails, is the wisest niggas
Let the time don't let it make you
Rehabilitate, come back a better person
You gonna slip up but as long as you're still working, god gonna watch over
The man that's working, for certain
Made mistakes but I bounced back with a purpose
Sorry to the people I made nervous
Real life is the best movie, a lot of characters, no editors
Everybody think they stars in this life, dude we flying to mars
We tripping off this petty shit, and buying these cars
Spend time with your family because they love you for real
Can't nobody love you, like the blood within, but suckers turn on you
Can't trust your friends until the next time, I'll be back again
Evil Red Flame edition, I'll be back, my friend
I'll be back again
Lil B

[Outro]
