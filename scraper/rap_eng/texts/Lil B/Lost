[Intro]
I'm so lost
Shit, I feel lost in this world
This world so big, I feel lost
I just feel so lost
I be feeling like I can get lost in this huge world
We all feel lost at times
You be like, "Damn, am I really gonna make it in this huge motherfucker?"

[Verse 1]
I lost so many niggas, I stopped giving a fuck
I'm like the government, I leave you stuck and blaze blunts
Niggas look in my eyes and wonder why I don't cry
How the fuck I survive? I would struggle with god
Niggas will slang back the fourth till the hustlers rise
Then the customers died, it was nothing to fly
Nigga taught me in the hood, you better run when you shine
I hit a nigga with the Glock that the government provide
Be prepared, never been scared of pussy
Pussy niggas eat pussy and gossip
Cry to the bitches, how you gonna live with that shit?
You was claiming gangsta, but you a little too late
I was coming off the porch when niggas was all straight
I stay away from the hate, because you niggas all fake
Lost pounds in the game, rounds to the fame
I went back and forth with the mirror, I see clearer
My soul needs rest and I never could sleep
Niggas will try to play me cheap, bitch, I'm down for the bleed
Broke the windows with my hand, no gloves on my fingers
Niggas was thugging for the hoes, and whose fit was the cleanest
That was never the pussy, I always had heart
Coming straight out the dark, nigga left you in the park
I'm certified, you can't break me apart
Always had heart, I'm alone in the dark, because I'm lost

[Outro]
Lil' B, I'm just lost
If you feel me, if you ever been lost
Raise your hands, cause I'm lost
I'm just lost
If ya feel me across, I'm just lost
Yeah, Lil B, I'm just lost
