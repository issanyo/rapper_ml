[Intro]
Welcome to the NBA, you're almost there
We getting close, we got scouts looking at us
This is worldwide, this is beautiful
We in the best hotels, eating the best food
The biggest houses, the nicest cars
Beautiful women, Hoop Life!

[Verse]
My material mind state, trynna stay on the court
I came from the court, no judges
This the hoop court, All-Star Game, the only judge
That throw numbers at me
Looking at the city, Oakland heals like Gotham
Oakland heals like Gotham, cause niggas watching
Never put past no one, copped like the old Ones
Niggas ready for war, like shogun
'Bout to play on TV, cable access
Newspaper, local access, who could match this?
Nigga, I would do a backflip
I'm trynna get out this mattress
Only time I feel good, is when a nigga at practice
Trynna make shots with my left hand
Gotta stop looking like Strahan, money ain't a thing
Fuck Instagram, I'm just trynna get instant grams
Man, my rap's old
I made it so instant, damn
Pulling niggas off for a instance
I got this bitch, man, shit, man, it's incense
You feel me? I smoke it, you love what you can't see
This game up to speed
Lord, help me, cause I'm seeing coke
And I don't know what to do, I'm just seeing boats
Zips in the locker room, the coach know I'm selling
Every time before the game
He always stay tripping
I ain't got no patience, coach, I'm just trynna make it
This is the reason why
There's patients out here, man, niggas dying
My time coming up man, I'm stationed
My time coming for real, I'm rap
My eyes open up, I'm running
My head's peeking up to them niggas that's coming
Traumatized by the game, putting niggas under graves
For that simple shit, this is simple, bitch
This hoop life is all I got
This my last shot, this my last rock
I'm passing rocks up the court
Selling dope in the locker room, like it's my last shot

[Outro]
Keep your head focused, young'n
Make sure you're doing well with your body
Don't hurt yourself
Hoop Life, we staying focused
Don't put no drugs in your body
Keep it focused for this Hoop Life when we playing the season
They trynna take you out the game, homie
They don't love you
They just trynna drug you up, feed you fast food, and get on to the next
They don't give a fuck about you
Hoop Life mixtape, let's go
