[Intro]
Brang dang
Grinding since '89
Hustling since '89, you feel me?

[Verse 1]
Bruh, give me all them racks, it's like I'm automatic
Bitch, I'm from the west, coast, yeah
Bitch, I'm real as fuck, I might go off and rob 'em
Bitch, I'm on my grind, and you can't tell me nothing
Waterfront daddy
What I'm riding in? Old school Caddy
I got a mask on, with my gloves on
Black hoody on, with my Vans on
I'm in the under whip, I got like three of 'em
And I can choose my car, I got like three of 'em
And I can choose my bitch, I got like three of 'em
Ask me if I'm cheating, I'll marry three of 'em
Yeah

[Hook]
I'm on the grind, bitch I'm on the grind (yeah)
I'm on the grind, I-I'm on the grind (all day)
I'm on the grind, bitch I'm on the grind (yeah)
I'm on the grind, bitch I'm on the grind

[Verse 2]
Working every day, I'ma get it, I'ma be honest
Making clean cash what I love, make it rain hundreds
Twamp sacks up in here, let me see some money
I'm on my grind, had purple zips every morning
We copped dub sacks, what I'm selling often
Then I'm breaking bitches down, like morning coffee
Excuse me sir, I got work if you need it bad
We got laptops, cellphones, and minicams
I'm on the internet, because I'm online
I got gold teeth, like that nigga Shyne
Tried to give me years, like my nigga Shyne
I told them haters "watch", let a brother shine
Yeah, it's real boss shit
I first made the paper, off hitting licks
And I'm not a bitch, I'm hella fine
I had to tell these suckers, that I'm getting mine

[Hook]
I'm on the grind, bitch I'm on the grind (BasedGod)
I'm on the grind, I'm-I'm on the grind (Based Lord)
Bitch I'm on the grind, bitch I'm on the grind (yeah)
I'm on the grind, I'm, I'm on the grind (yeah)
Bitch I'm on the grind, bitch I'm on the grind (BasedGod)
I'm on the grind, bitch I'm on the grind (Based Lord)
I'm on the grind, bitch I'm on the grind (you feel me?)
I'm on the grind, I'm, I'm on the grind, bitch (I'm on my motherfucking grind, you feel me?)

[Outro]
I'ma tell you niggas, I'm on the grind like a hundred thousand
It's your boy, Lil B
Yeah
Rawest rapper alive in this thing
Telling you man, that I've been on my grind from sunup to sundown
You feel me?
Sunup never go down, you feel me?
Sunup the bitch, you feel me?
Lil B for "Lil Boss", man
