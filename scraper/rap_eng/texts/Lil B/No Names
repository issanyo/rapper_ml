Yea, Lil B
I'm with that thug shit man
You from the hood, so spit that shit

Had drugs in yo mouth, we lived that kind of shit
Had ten stolen cars, I did that kind of shit
Almost lost my life, I felt that kind of pain
Went down to court and I ain't sayin no names

Had drugs in yo mouth, we lived that kind of shit
Had ten stolen cars, I did that kind of shit
Almost lost my life, I felt that kind of pain
Went down to court and I ain't sayin no names

Man, niggas don't know I've been out here living
One thing they do know â€“ they got beds in prison
And they waitin for the niggas that's out there livin
Better slow down man, and find yo mission
Cuz niggas get fucked in the worst position
They be happy with 30, do 10, they quittin
Do 5 hour house drug program living
Lindsay Lohan don't know about my program
Transfer you by a bus, shackle you -- you know you gettin washed
Why you lookin through the window? Barely seeing through
Tryna wave at the car that's driving past you
Lookin at the city man, this shit ain't pretty
I'm just tryina dance like my nigga Diddy
Ten years ago, niggas wasn't programmed with me
Now every program got a program with me
You in the game and you doin rap shows for one-fifty
Suckas man, you better watch your shit
Cuz niggas gon fake when the darkness hit
A lot of people die just for talkin shit
Spark the shit, you better spark the clip (you feel me?)
Niggas act weird with that awful shit
Off this shit, takin off his shit
All this shit, I'll ride on any sucka
Tell them cocksuckers they can't touch us (Lil Boss!)
