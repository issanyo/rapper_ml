[Intro]
It's the White Flame, bitch
It's the Bitch Mob, bitch

[Hook]
Don't you know

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Hundred grand easy
Bitch you best believe me
Young BasedGod is that nigga on TV
That ho paid in full
But I'm strapped, you best believe me
Ride around with thangs
Man I make that shit look easy
Hold that Mac 80
That's some shit you've seen on TV
Pretty bitch party
Every girl love me

Underground Atlanta
Shout out to Decatur
Shout out to Lil B
A fool with that Heateee
Pistol in my pocket

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Niggas don't want no problems
Problems lead to problems

Boy thugging hard
Man, he thugging hardly
I'mma fuck his bitch
And I told him I was sorry
Only BasedGod is the nigga riding Harley
Roll up on my bitch and she took me to a party
Young BasedGod is fucking so gnarly

Lil B you look godly
56 bitches and they call me Steve Harvey
Everybody know that my swag up to par
And that four-fifty-four

Guns in my home
And my car is a rocket
Turn my bitch on
Then I plug her in the socket
