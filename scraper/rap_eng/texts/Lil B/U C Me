(Verse 1: Lil B)
It's fuck niggas to the core, and fuck bitches to the core
I'm still bagging up dope like them dudes in Baltimore
Them niggas wasn't sure, them niggas wasn't lure
Selling out- like the laundry mat
Big dope pontiac
OG told me that
Basedworld got my back
Street niggas, aston martins, big business
Can't get pissed off for pistol whipping
Make smart decisions
One decision's on to your life
All for your life
To figures, walking at night
You know what I'm saying?
I be walking next to dope fiends, lighting a pipe
You be riding in your car
Bitch, and I be riding a bike
Early morning trash on the street
How I'm gon' sleep
Wanna take off my shoes, needles on the street
Niggas don't trust shit, just an eagle on the beat
I'm trying to eagle on the street
Nigga eat on these bitches
When a dude on yo team
You feel me
Cause I don't lose nigga, I will take out yo team
Jaw wide shut and I will take out yo teeth
Shoutout to believers, nigga, I believe
Money scheme, getting dope nigga
Hope that shit nigga
The money I blow
Niggas whose figgas is rookies
I was feeding off dreams in history books
Wanted that lean nigga
What does that mean nigga?
Bitch I want crack to sell and an ave. as well
Street niggas on the ave as well
My gun got mighty, but my gun don't tell
Bullets change up knock dumb less scared
I'm not no punk I swear
Niggas talk, bitch I will dump, I swear
Let's get married, niggas just to get divorced
True street nigga, cause I walk in choice
A whole court any time I hold court
Make smart moves, even legends have a slow start
Fuck every sucka I'm living with a blowtorch
Burn a fire, setting off knowledge
Starting off a click clack gangs in college
Niggas is legit mayhem, 'nam sayin'

(Outro: Lil B)
I'm killing niggas man, you know what I'm saying, 05 fuck 'em man, you know... I gotta do me, you know what I'm saying, cause you know these niggas just be stealing my shit, you know what I'm saying, think about the rap game what it is now, you feel me, you know I changed that motherfucka, It's me, you know what I'm say- you hear me in everything, so that's what you see, niggas can't be mad man cause it's just like man lil b everywhere you see me everywhere
