[Intro]
It seems that I've floated too far out to sea
So, I'm writing a letter to myself
Just to tell myself what I really feel
When I wasn't too far and couldn't say it

[Verse]
Hey, Dear Brandon
How are you doing, and what are you doing?
This is Based, so you know it's something real from the poet
Something from the heart
You just know it
So, what's up with your family?
Everybody, how you doing?
Keeping it gangster, I love 'em
How are you doing?
Keeping it real, so real
I'm out to sea
Out to see everything
I still've yet to see
Lil B
Or Brandon
Bruno
Remember that, B?
Remember what Mom used to call you, Lil B?
Rappin' when you was a little smaller
The Sonic Couch
Sega Games
All your little partners
Remember that?
Remember Arts Magnet?
Longfellow, all of that?
The fun times
Crazy times
Headstart
Everything getting a headstart
Remember that?
Remember falling off the bike the first time?
Remember riding around Waterfront all night?
Remember that?
Remember The East Bay Vivarium?
I said
Lil B, Remember The Vivarium?
Or Brandon, excuse me
But once again, Brandon, dear Brandon
Remember everything else
Remember when you had your first performance when you was younger?
You had a poet contest
It was a little thing
You was talking about your pet reptile and you didn't even have one
Remember you lied and said you had an iguana and didn't have one?
That was funny
I remember that
So funny
Second Grade
Classrooms
On the computers -
Remember when computers first came out
The old school Macs? -
In the computer lab with all my friends
Brandon, remember everything else -
When you was on the boat
And you took the trip at Arts Magnet?
Stayed the night, overnight -
Deck hand crew
Boat crew
Cooking crew?
You was up all night
Beating sailor man's time by Oh-Three-Hundred
A Hundred Million Oh Nine
You know I play around
I had to keep with my lingo
Keep setting trends and keep saying bingo
But I gotta go, I'm floating too far out to sea
Dear Brandon, dear Based God
Never forget anything that you've done
And don't wait till you're out to sea to appreciate it
