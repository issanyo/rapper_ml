Oh my God, I'm Mel Gibson!

Bitches suck my dick because I fuck 'em like an actor!
Yeah, I got swagger!

Bitches suck my dick because I fuck 'em like an rapper!

[Verse 1]
Bitches steady choosin', rich nigga music
Young BasedGod fuck yo bitch cuz she stupid
Thirty on my dick and I'm high like my groupies
Ten on my dick cuz my diamonds white like Snoopy
Yell out "West Side" cuz I'm rich and I'm ruthless
Right hand bling... on my dick
Twenty on my wrist cuz I'm that pretty bitch
Young BasedGod got tatted like a bitch
Rich nigga music, pretty boy music
Young BasedGod (make) bitches park like amusement
Hoes on my dick: they give a fuck about the music
Bad model bitches suck my dick in the jacuzzi
All these bitches stupid, thirty on my right hand
Young BasedGod got fifty on my necklace
Ten hoes flexin, these girls on my nuts
Woodgrain grippin' and that ho down to fuck
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Cocaine BasedGod, bitch La Cosa Nostra
Zips in the closet, money in the sofa

Number one pimp, Lil B gon' fuck some
Bitch, my name Brandon, Lil B my main ho
Dress that bitch up, then you get what you signed fo'
Betta yet paid fo', thirty thousand movement
Young BasedGod like an actor in a movie
Ridin' 'round town and I'm yellin', "Bitch, sue me!"
Niggas gettin' mad cuz they girl wanna do me

Thirty clip handgun: I'm Based but I use it

[Hook]
