Tell homegirl, lift that azz up
Bitch if you a freak, lift that azz up
Hoes around town, lift that azz up
Don't put that shit down, lift that azz up

[Verse]
You know when I come, man I go in the Bay
Fuck a bitch first night, I don't never date
If you wanna ask Lil B he penetrate
Yeah you can fuck my bitch bruh and I instigate
Now you can tell my girl come shake it for me

[Hook]

[Verse]
All the girls, put your hands on your knees
All the girls, put your hands on your knees
All the girls, put your hands on your knees
All the girls, put your hands on your knees
I'ma break the bitch back with a 20 inch
5150 all up in a bitch mouth
3130 I don't think you heard me
Fuckin' with a boy like I'm in the dirty
E14 nigga like I'm in the East
Girl shake them titties, bitch show the streets
Start freshin' everybody in the crowd
I'ma beat the pussy down, how you like me now

Bitch how you like me now
All them fine girls in the building, shake that ass bitch

I got girls okay, no ID, no wristband
We got money and alcohol
All the best parties every night
Bitch fuck around, I tell you this
Young BasedGod with that 90 inch
Had the females go dick hunting
If she no look, I'ma show the bitch somethin'

[Hook]

Yeah, man, like I said man
All the ladies if you feelin' good tonight
Let me hear you say "Yeah!"

Homegirl dance like a pornstar
She a good girl and she party hard
On the stripper pole, bitch you look the best
Girl you look good, go twerk that shit
All that money bitch in your pocket book
I'ma show the bitch 30 like a G do
I'ma pay 20 grand for some fuckin' head
Yeah I'm payin' for the pussy, that's what I said
BasedGod

Where all the bitches at in the building
Where all the ladies
Shake that ass, mane
You know what it is
Lil B BasedGod, let' get it

[Hook]
