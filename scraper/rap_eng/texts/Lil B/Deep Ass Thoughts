[Intro: Lil B]
Man I just got some deep ass thoughts
Man shit, sitting in this old ass car man
Feel like shit don't never change, ya feel me?
But it change everyday
I feel like we a part of one big organism
Just stay positive, it's bigger than what we really think

[Verse 1: Lil B]
I think, I think I will succeed, if I try my best
I think I won't do well, if I put my brain to rest
And I sit it at the end of the hallway, waiting at the end of the line
Because some boys don't try when their brain is not fried
What we do see, it hates within for our own brothers
Because the next brother got a shiny new car that can drive for em'
We got a bucket that stop every second
So you pop a brother with a gun to end his life just like that
From the bullet in the gat, that you shot, just like that
You should feel pain, because you just ended a brain
Father, son, grand-kid, anything
You wanna just, think before you bust a gun
No more racism
Please show there always will be a light at the end of tunnel
But when there ain't, you should hope that it works out
Cuz it will be okay

[Hook: Lil B]
Man, I just got some deep ass thoughts
Man, I just got some deep ass thoughts
Bruh, man, I just got some deep ass thoughts
Man, I just got some deep ass thoughts
For real, I just got some deep ass thoughts
Man for real, I just got some deep ass thoughts
For real, I got some deep ass thoughts
Man for real, I got some deep ass thoughts

[Verse 2: Lil B]
What if I float, away today, would you cry for me?
Or would you share every ugh, please!
Based World, we designed to leave
I'm on the grind, cause niggas ain't dying for me
I know my mom would, cuz she made me
I know my dad would, cuz he made me
All my life on the block I was crazy
I'm on the block. Wall Street, bitch, pay me
They passin' new laws, that gonna lock you down
I'm staying 10 toes down, they won't stop me now
Don't pass out, throwing gas out
Took the fast route, pull a mask out
Yeah, you sleep now
I'm playing... off the beatdown
And I hear the streets calling, niggas cheap man
I change my number often
You can tell how he acts
He's gonna be sleeping in the coffin

[Hook: Lil B]

[Outro: Lil B]
This for everybody that, they think so hard, man they thoughts be so deep
And don't nobody believe them
But, I believe you
I believe I can talk to the bugs, I ain't gonna lie
But, that's another chapter
I'mma try to understand
Keep it based
God's Father mixtape
It's your boy, Lil B
