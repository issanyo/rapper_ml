[Intro: Lil B]
Do da BasedGod, yeah. Do da-, know what I'm saying? 05 Fuck Em nigga, do da BasedGod. You know what I'm saying? Bitch Mob what it do? Based boys

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Niggas be fucking with me, get their head popped
I be on the block with forty, like E-40
Niggas get the last shots for fucking with the BasedGod
Niggas be cool but why you hate the BasedGod?
Maybach sixty-two bitch with the space spot
Fee fi fo fum, fucking hoes in the bum
Fucking hoes in the mouth for hating on the BasedGod
I wanna take this timeout to say 'Thank You BasedGod'
Shoutout to Mac Miller, I still got the Mac Miller
Kill 'em with the Mac Miller, I got a couple straps nigga
Yeah, I got ???
Thirty with the motherfucking Desert Eagles bitch
Thirty bitches want to fuck me, eww
I got thirty bitches, oh my god I'm so special
I don't be fucking with the girls unless they special
You never seen my bitch before, she is like a gecko
She want to be called a girl, I'm like 'yup'
She want to be called a bitch, I'm like 'next'
Got too many bitches, there's way too many bitches
These bitches want to fuck me, and have my fucking baby
Pop that Glock nine, bitch you hating
I see fucking niggas and no I don't fuck with you
I got a book, you should read it
I got the whole game if you really fucking need it
BasedGod!

[Hook: Lil B] (x8)
BasedGod. Do da BasedGod

[Verse 2: Lil B]
It's some real street niggas from the whole fuckin' bay
I be out in 'em, it's like 'Bitch, where you stay?'
'Light bitch, where you rocking'?' 'Light bitch, where you drankin'?'
'Light bitch, turn up, I be hyphy off the drank.'
Niggas got swag, but I don't really fuck with y'all
Fuck your ho in the mouth, then I sell an eight-ball
Wassup with it, my niggas go dumb like Mac Dre did it
Like Mac Dre did it!
This on me, that's on life
Nigga, I'm real as it gets
Bitch, no cheques
Fuck your bitch and fuck you bitch
Imma tell you this 'bout this
And Imma tell you that 'bout this
Imma tell the bitch 'bout bitch
And I'm tell tell mmm meh!
