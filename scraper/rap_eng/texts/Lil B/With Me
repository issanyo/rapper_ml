[Intro]
Gotta watch out
For these fake ass broads
They tryna take yo...
Know what I'm saying keep your eyes open man these girls be faking
Dudes be faking too, but I ain't worried about them we talking about the ladies know what I mean

[Chorus]
You can't lose if you're fucking with me
She cash out when she fucking with me
You love the based god and you love Lil B
She cash out when she fucking with me
All I do is sell Jerry's and dreams
She wanna be famous, then stay with me
Your bitch cash out cause she don't love me
Bitch

[Verse 1]
Feel me
You gotta watch you, watch your back know what I'm saying
You get it though feel me, ya
It's your boy Lil B man
Stay with it, I stay with it
I stay with it

I just mastermind the game
Switch up like skateboards
Bouncing back I just bounce off me more
Only thing I know is credit or debit
If the bitch love me then she can get it
I'm tired of cashing out on these broke ass bitches
Fucking these hoes raw and feeding the bitches
She said her dog died and she need some money
And bitch, you gonna need a doctor
Guess I can't be mad cause I played myself
Living fantasies, the game of death
Gotta stay connected so you won't get infected
The game is infested with these broke ass bitches
There's a lot of fake P's and scandalous niggas
Riding a bar, trying to pimp some bitches
Need to step your game up and go hit a lick
Man shut the fuck up and quit worrying about a bitch
All a hoe can do is make you sick
Crying all with them AIDS and shit
Bitch got herpes and she trying to fuck ya
Your last name Rhymes cause you was a buster
I don't give a fuck man if you really love her
I'm telling you this game if you really love her
It's 2016 bitch, cash me out
If these hoes not paying, I'm moving down south

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You feel me
So once we get to this spot where we at
Stay in these type predicaments but it's all good we see the game, see what they tryna run
I see what they tryna do
Don't gate the player hate the game but I hate both
Most of these bitches don't know how to do
Watching movies and think it's rude
Bitch you need to stop
Bitch you out there trippin' for real
Knocking bitches out cause I know what's real
Bitch stay away cause I'm a jealous guy
Bitch keep playing if she don't want to die
I'm not taking L's hoe, I'm not that guy

Bitch I know
Bitch I know
Jealous of me
These hoes jealous of me
Bitch just cash out on me
Bitch just cast out on me
These hoes is jealous of me
Hoe, cash out on me biatch


[Chorus]

[Outro]
Bitch I know
