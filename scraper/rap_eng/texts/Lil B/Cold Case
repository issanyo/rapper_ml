This is our time...
I really got to give a shout out to everybody worldwide that's going through it
All the third world countries, you feel me
I want to shout out Mexico, it's real life there
Seen little kids die, that's just not fair
Who am I to speak? I just really care
If you was living there it can happen anywhere
People kill my people for the root of all evil
Separating people by the money, all science
It was all alliance, siding with the giants
You swimming with the pirates
Please stop killing over drugs, past debts
Old favors, no paper, still having court cases
Please save us, what happened to "love your neighbor"
People turning haters, worldwide corporate going lawless
Lets stay real but your parents wasn't honest
This shit really hurts my soul
How come the kids can't grow what kind of world is this
Do we really exist? Yea we do because I feel alive
Please don't cry, please don't cry
Back against the wall they gon' leave for dead
You got a manager, but you're just a percentage
People watch you like you're watching a...
Game, it's not for beginners
Keep it real man, nigga you got played on Christmas
It's no honor in the game of business
People come from the streets, nigga they checking the game for winners
I'mma lay a bitch down then hit them up with the Glock
Bring that shit to the streets if the drama don't stop
Had to call the police because you couldn't deal with it
Niggas caught up on the streets, never asking who did it
People go mystical when your money's no limit
This is shit all real I'm fronting no gimmicks
Reverse the whip fuck the tense niggas seeing me
I ain't got no reason to hide, duck low man you gon be
Motherfucking surprised, keep it real nigga
I'm not one of those guys
Niggas snitching on who when you cut them pies
If you do that dirt, you gon' take that time
You ain't thinking straight nigga, go wash your eyes
And come back and tell me that you're cut out for it
Don't lie, don't, psh, man I'm not a lawyer
Shout out to motherfucking Evan Sawyer
Dreams and pain, you feel me
Never hit the brakes, this a cold case
This a cold case
P.Y.T. mixatpe, Lil B, yeah
