[Verse 1: Lil B]
All my niggas tight, most niggas getting lazy
Slacking on they self gave up before they time up
Waiting for a meal a lot of niggas got to line up
A lot of niggas try to make cash before they time up
Saying I'm the shit cause I never gave my grind up
Rapping when I'm awake thinking verses when I sleep
Bitches call me daddy not knowing that they time up
Women not bitches cause bitches hate women
So I gotta test, find out who I stand by
Never get [?] to hold over like standby
Got a big mouth could explode like a landmine
Gotta think good that's why my brains where my vans lie
Soaking up game to the point where I'm that fine
Friends say I'm cute but my bitches say I'm that fly
I'm a BasedGod so I go even harder
Ya nigga real cool but yo girl taking orders
Lil B
