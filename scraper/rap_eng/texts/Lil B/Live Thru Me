[Intro]
Captain, captain! I want to say hello to all the Task Force! Thank you for coming seeing Lil B today. Now, we have some important information that we need to get by before everything's get started. Welcome to the 100% Gutta mixtape! Oh my god!

[Hook 1]
All my niggas, hold your head for me
Hold your head young nigga, hold your head for me
All my niggas, hold your head for me
Hold your head young nigga, hold your head for me
All my niggas, hold your head for me
Hold your head young nigga, hold your head for me
All my niggas, hold your head for me
Young nigga, hold your head for me
All my niggas that died in the streets
Keep it real. You live thru me
All my niggas that died in the streets
Keep it real. You live thru me

[Verse 1]
I was thinking 'bout my niggas in caskets
I was at the funerals, wasn't nobody laughing
How the game so cold? They slid on him in traffic
Man you live by the gun? Killing people is tragic
People that I really loved. Despite all the talks
That was my nigga, and you killed my nigga!
This is not a pain song to keep the process going
I ain't trying to have no niggas out here, gun-showing
Man, you know I keep it real. Niggas hate that truth
That real talk shit, make them niggas wanna forfeit
Take more losses than profit
If everybody dying, then what's the meaning of these objects?
People trying to chase freedom: you can live through me!
See the big picture, or the DVD
You see, anything that you choose you can be:
Better than Lil B. That's the humble offspring
Help the offspring. Helping all spring
If I gave to the world, this my offering
I'm a helper, putting shit in the cellars
If you need it, then I got it. What the fuck can I tell ya'?
Lil B, yeah. And I got you forever
Task Force, Bitch Mob, you know we rocking together
Based World, Gold House, you know I'm rocking whenever
Lil B, motherfucker. Can't stop me. Never

[Hook 2]
Hold your head for me
All my niggas hold your head for me
All my niggas, hold your head for me
All my niggas, hold your head for me
All my niggas that died in the streets
Keep it real, you live thru me
All my niggas that died in the streets
Keep it real, you live thru me

[Outro]
R.I.P. all my niggas man. You feel me? Worldwide. Hey, like I said, it's 100% Gutta mixtape. Lil B. Keep it real, you live thru me. All my niggas that died in the streets, keep it real. You live thru me
