[Intro: Lil B]
I really can't hit nobody 'cause I know everybody snitchin'

[Hook]
I'm praying for a brick
I'm praying for a brick
I'm praying for a brick
I'm praying for a brick
I'm praying for a brick
I'm praying for a brick
I'm praying for a brick
I'm praying for a brick

[Verse 1 - Lil B]
I can't talk on phones so I pray for them bricks
Don't trust nobody so I had to hit a lick
Pulling armed robbery, Maserati with no tint
I already got money, why hit that lick?
Put myself in positions that don't make sense
If I became president I would still hit a lick
Might slap my (ahh!)
Might rob my (ahh!)
Never ask for
'Cause I know you gon' snitch
I know you gon' snitch
I know you gon' snitch
Don't ask me for shit
'Cause I know you gon' snitch

[Hook]
I'm praying for a brick (x8)

[Interlude: Lil B]
You know what I'm saying? Free all the people from the struggle, man
That's down locked down

[Verse 2 - Lil B]
Free Sam Hurd, 'cause I'm tryna cop a brick
Free Big Meech, 'cause I'm tryna cop a brick
Free BG, 'cause I'm tryna cop six
If you won't take ten, then I dont want shit
If you won't take five, you must be a bitch
Get out of the game, if you can't take a lick
Don't speak in codes, please, don't say shit
Look me in my eyes 'cause I'm paying for a brick

[Hook]
I'm praying for a brick
I'm praying for a brick
I'm praying for a brick
I'm praying for a brick
I'm praying for a brick
I'm praying for a brick
I'm praying for a brick
I swear to god you not gon' snitch

[Outro: Lil B]
Knockin', know what I'm sayin'?
We knockin' ass down, know what I'm sayin'?
Fuck all that, man
I don't respect that, man
Don't get in the game if you ain't about that, man
I'm praying for a brick
I'm praying for a lick
I'm praying for a brick
Bay Area boys, you feel me
West Coast
West Side up man
Hey man if you praying for a brick throw ya hands up
If you praying for a bowl, know what I'm sayin'?
If you praying for a fifty throw that up man
East Side bricks
South Side bricks
North Side bricks
Mid-west bricks
Colombian bricks
Mexico bricks
Bricks
European bricks
Based God

05 Fuck Em Mixtape Nigga
Tell ya bitch to suck my dick
